and check up on him.

169
00:10:29,986 --> 00:10:33,072
Yeah, I agree. Let me just tell my dad,
then we'll go.

170
00:10:33,156 --> 00:10:34,282
- <i>Give me ten.</i>
- Okay.

171
00:10:36,409 --> 00:10:39,287
Team Paul Bunyan.
I'd like to purchase your finest tree.

172
00:10:39,746 --> 00:10:43,124
Actually, Cheryl, I was just about to take
a break, but Vic here can help you. Vic.

173
00:10:45,835 --> 00:10:48,630
What can I get you?
We got some nice spruces.

174
00:11:03,686 --> 00:11:05,188
[Betty] There's the chicken soup.

175
00:11:07,232 --> 00:11:08,942
[knocking on door]

176
00:11:09,025 --> 00:11:09,984
Mr. Svenson!

177
00:11:28,419 --> 00:11:29,337
Can I help you?

178
00:11:30,004 --> 00:11:30,880
Jughead Jones?

179
00:11:32,465 --> 00:11:33,299
Maybe.

180
00:11:33,383 --> 00:11:35,468
I'm Jack Walsh, your dad's parole officer.

181
00:11:36,427 --> 00:11:37,303
He's not home.

182
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:40,890
Doesn't need to be.
Do you mind if I come in?

183
00:11:41,766 --> 00:11:42,767
Like I have a choice.

184
00:11:47,105 --> 00:11:51,359
Hiram, was that a Spiffany's bag
I saw come into the lobby earlier today?

185
00:11:51,693 --> 00:11:53,820
Looked about the right size
for a Glamergé egg.

186
00:11:54,404 --> 00:11:57,115
That depends.
Have you been naughty or nice?

187
00:11:57,198 --> 00:11:58,324
[Hermione laughing]

188
00:11:59,867 --> 00:12:01,703
[Hiram] Don't worry, <i>mija.</i>
Santa has your list, too.

189
00:12:02,203 --> 00:12:05,331
And please don't go snooping
for the gifts this year. He hates that.

190
00:12:05,415 --> 00:12:09,711
Santa can rip up my list for all I care.
I mean, look at us,

191
00:12:09,794 --> 00:12:13,840
throwing money away on bejeweled eggs
like we're a family of Russian oligarchs

192
00:12:13,923 --> 00:12:16,968
when there are people in this town who
can't even pay their own medical bills.

193
00:12:17,051 --> 00:12:18,803
Since when are you a communist?

194
00:12:19,262 --> 00:12:23,766
Since Archie told me that he and his dad
are drowning in Fred's medical bills

195
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:28,187
to the tune of $86,000,
which is why I was thinking...

196
00:12:28,271 --> 00:12:30,565
- Absolutely not.
- That's a lot of money.

197
00:12:30,648 --> 00:12:33,651
The Lodge charitable trust has made
its donations for the fiscal year.

198
00:12:33,735 --> 00:12:36,279
Fred Andrews will have
to tighten his belt.

199
00:12:36,362 --> 00:12:38,239
Said Ebenezer Scrooge.

200
00:12:38,906 --> 00:12:41,617
Fred's selling Christmas trees
for extra cash.

201
00:12:41,701 --> 00:12:45,330
I mean, that's the kind of man...
The kind of father he is.

202
00:12:45,413 --> 00:12:46,247
You know...

203
00:12:48,374 --> 00:12:50,335
I believe I have some work
to finish in the study.

204
00:12:54,964 --> 00:12:56,382
[humming]

205
00:12:57,967 --> 00:13:01,095
[Penelope] Cheryl Marjorie Blossom,
what have you done?

206
00:13:01,554 --> 00:13:04,640
Isn't it obvious, Mother?
I've saved Christmas.

207
00:13:05,767 --> 00:13:07,393
Look how happy Nana Rose is.

208
00:13:08,227 --> 00:13:13,024
You spoiled, wretched little brat.
How do you expect to pay for all this?

209
00:13:13,816 --> 00:13:14,734
Oh.

210
00:13:15,485 --> 00:13:19,489
I was thinking maybe you could go
to Mr. Lodge for a job.

211
00:13:20,281 --> 00:13:23,493
Of course, he'd probably ask what skills
you have, and you'd be forced to admit

212
00:13:23,576 --> 00:13:26,996
that the only skill you have is being
a terrible mother.

213
00:13:28,331 --> 00:13:30,666
I guess you're gonna have
to get creative in the new year.

214
00:13:34,003 --> 00:13:35,046
[sighs]

215
00:13:35,129 --> 00:13:39,634
You should've drowned them at birth,
like a basket of kittens.

216
00:13:56,275 --> 00:13:58,444
Mom? Dad?

217
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:00,613
Betty.

218
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,616
- Hey.
- Hey.

219
00:14:04,492 --> 00:14:05,576
How are you?

220
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,204
Fine, I just iced
some ginger bread cookies.

221
00:14:08,287 --> 00:14:09,330
Polly's favorite.

222
00:14:09,414 --> 00:14:12,208
Just in case there's a Christmas miracle
and she comes home.

223
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,586
Oh, by the way, there was a gift
for you on the steps.

224
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,296
Your secret Santa.

225
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,382
I took it up to your room.

226
00:14:22,427 --> 00:14:23,469
Secret Santa?

227
00:14:37,275 --> 00:14:38,192
[gasps]

228
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:49,371
"Enclosed is a finger that belongs
to the sinner Joseph Conway."

229
00:14:49,454 --> 00:14:51,247
He's talking about Mr. Svenson.

230
00:14:51,706 --> 00:14:54,167
"You have one final trespass to unearth.

231
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:58,505
Find the truth, reveal it to the town,
and you'll perhaps save his life."

232
00:14:58,588 --> 00:15:03,385
He kidnapped Mr. Svenson, Arch.
And now he's mutilating him.

233
00:15:04,177 --> 00:15:06,179
[cell phone buzzing]

234
00:15:06,262 --> 00:15:07,514
Arch, Arch. Hey.

235
00:15:12,352 --> 00:15:15,105
- [Svenson] <i>Betty, please.</i>
- Mr. Svenson, is that you?

236
00:15:16,064 --> 00:15:19,401
[Black Hood] <i>It is, Betty,
but his name's Joseph Conway.</i>

237
00:15:19,484 --> 00:15:21,152
<i>He's lost a lot of blood.</i>

238
00:15:21,236 --> 00:15:24,531
<i>Though it's nothing compared to the blood
on the hands of this town.</i>

239
00:15:24,614 --> 00:15:28,326
<i>Exhume the past,
find where the primal sin was committed</i>

240
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:31,287
<i>and you'll find
the sinner Conway may be alive.</i>

241
00:15:31,371 --> 00:15:33,039
- <i>And as always, don't...</i>
- What?

242
00:15:33,915 --> 00:15:36,209
You maniac. Don't tell Sheriff Keller?

243
00:15:37,585 --> 00:15:38,837
[line beeps]

244
00:15:39,254 --> 00:15:43,341
Archie, what sin? What can
Mr. Svenson possibly be guilty of?

245
00:15:43,425 --> 00:15:45,218
Veronica and I talked to him.

246
00:15:45,301 --> 00:15:47,720
His entire family was murdered
by some crazy preacher.

247
00:15:47,804 --> 00:15:51,141
Maybe the people who adopted him
know something we don't.

248
00:15:51,224 --> 00:15:54,894
Wait. Before he was adopted,
Mr. Svenson lived as Joseph Conway

249
00:15:54,978 --> 00:15:56,354
at the Sisters of Quiet Mercy.

250
00:15:56,438 --> 00:15:59,274
- Will they talk to us?
- They better.

- Did you open them?
- No, Dad.

266
00:17:21,231 --> 00:17:22,690
Out of respect for you.

267
00:17:23,233 --> 00:17:27,153
But your parole officer, Mr. Walsh,
he sure was curious.

268
00:17:27,237 --> 00:17:29,781
- Walsh was here?
- Yeah. Don't worry. I got rid of him.

269
00:17:29,864 --> 00:17:33,451
But he already has heard that the Serpents
are moving into narcos territory.

00:17:46,464 --> 00:17:48,675
for you, your mom, Jellybean.

274
00:17:49,342 --> 00:17:53,179
Christmas Day, I thought we'd take a ride
to Toledo and deliver them in person.

275
00:17:55,473 --> 00:17:57,725
Dad, this isn't gonna work.

276
00:17:58,309 --> 00:18:03,940
Today, it's gifts, tomorrow, it's drugs,
or weapons, or God knows what.

277
00:18:04,399 --> 00:18:07,569
- How long is this gonna go on...?
- As long as Penny wants.

278
00:18:07,652 --> 00:18:10,238
If her favors keep getting bigger,
which you know that they will,

279
00:18:10,321 --> 00:18:12,365
what happens when she asks
for more Serpents on this?

280
00:18:12,448 --> 00:18:14,158
Then I'll bring more Serpents!

281
00:18:16,411 --> 00:18:20,081
You know what? You're right, this isn't
gonna work, you and I living together.

282
00:18:20,164 --> 00:18:22,250
So maybe you can go back to Fred's
or to Betty's.

283
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:26,170
- Betty? I split with Betty to...
- Then what do you want me to say?!

284
00:18:26,254 --> 00:18:30,842
I just want you to let me help fix
this mess that I made.

285

Get this through your thick skull,
Jughead. We're trapped.

286
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:36,055
We got no leverage.

287
00:18:36,723 --> 00:18:39,976
If that means I gotta be Penny's
dancing monkey for the time being,

288
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:41,477
then that's how it goes.

289
00:18:44,314 --> 00:18:47,150
I'm gonna get some rest.
I have a long night ahead of me.

290
00:18:48,985 --> 00:18:52,947
Yes, hello, I'm calling
to settle an account

291
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:55,658
for one of your patients, Fred Andrews.

292
00:18:57,243 --> 00:18:59,412
Of course, I'm his business partner.

293
00:19:00,788 --> 00:19:01,831
Uh-huh.

294
00:19:01,914 --> 00:19:05,501
I'd like to pay the bill in full
and keep it anonymous,

295
00:19:05,585 --> 00:19:06,794
an angel donation.

296
00:19:08,463 --> 00:19:10,214
Yes, I'm aware of the amount.

297
00:19:11,424 --> 00:19:12,258
My name?

298
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,389
Hermione Apollonia Lodge.
And it's a black American Excess card.

299
00:19:18,973 --> 00:19:22,477
Number 29572300...

300
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,188
Penny Peabody has got
my dad dealing drugs.

301
00:19:26,397 --> 00:19:29,692
I know this,
'cause she had me doing it before him.

302
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:34,322
Now she's roped in Tall Boy
and Sweet Pea.

303
00:19:34,405 --> 00:19:36,574
Man, if you're pissed
because your old man tapped me...

304
00:19:36,658 --> 00:19:40,912
No, Sweet Pea, I'm pissed
because I don't want the Serpents

305
00:19:40,995 --> 00:19:42,497
to end up like the Ghoulies.

306
00:19:43,247 --> 00:19:45,083
And I doubt
that any of you became Serpents

307
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:48,211
just to be at the beck and call
of a drug queenpin.

308
00:19:49,212 --> 00:19:50,588
I know where this ends.

309
00:19:51,005 --> 00:19:52,799
Death, jail.

310
00:19:54,342 --> 00:19:57,929
Which is why
in the interest of self-preservation...

311
00:19:59,972 --> 00:20:01,099
we have to take out Penny.

312
00:20:02,225 --> 00:20:04,227
Snake Charmer's helped some of us.

313
00:20:05,311 --> 00:20:08,898
Oh, yeah? What did she ask for
in return, Sweet Pea?

314
00:20:08,981 --> 00:20:09,982
How many favors?

315
00:20:10,983 --> 00:20:13,236
Now, if we don't stop Penny tonight...

316
00:20:14,195 --> 00:20:18,282
she is going to get
every single one of us in on this.

317
00:20:18,366 --> 00:20:21,202
I promise you. I promise you, Sweet Pea.

318
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:26,916
What I'm asking is,
are you willing to risk your necks

319
00:20:27,417 --> 00:20:28,835
to save my dad's life?

320
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:36,050
- What is the first law?
- No Serpent stands alone.

321
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:42,140
I'm in.

322
00:20:42,223 --> 00:20:43,266
Me too.

323
00:20:46,561 --> 00:20:47,395
Let's do this.

00:20:53,985 --> 00:20:55,111
Joseph Conway,

325
00:20:55,528 --> 00:20:58,781
Joseph Svenson as you know him,
was a troubled youth.

326
00:20:58,865 --> 00:21:01,367
- There was no saving him.
- Meaning, he was a sinner?

327
00:21:01,451 --> 00:21:05,413
- No, he was a child, a victim.
- Did he suffer from survivor's guilt?

328
00:21:08,624 --> 00:21:11,002
I've already said too much.

329
00:21:11,085 --> 00:21:12,754
- [Betty] No.
- [Archie] Betty.

330
00:21:13,796 --> 00:21:18,760
Sister Woodhouse,
when my sister escaped this dungeon,

331
00:21:18,843 --> 00:21:21,471
she told me
all about the corporal punishment.

332
00:21:21,554 --> 00:21:24,474
So, please help us with this,

333
00:21:24,891 --> 00:21:28,102
or I will expose
the Sisters of Quiet Mercy

334
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:30,897
for the house of horrors
that it really is.

335
00:21:33,983 --> 00:21:36,194
[Woodhouse]
After his family was massacred,

336
00:21:36,652 --> 00:21:40,823
young Conway... Svenson identified
the man responsible.

337
00:21:41,407 --> 00:21:44,410
Then a small group of Riverdale citizens

338
00:21:44,994 --> 00:21:50,625
took matters into their own hands,
and, well, executed him.

339
00:21:52,084 --> 00:21:53,836
It was only later when he was with us

340
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,839
that Joseph admitted that,
in his terror and shock,

341
00:21:56,923 --> 00:21:59,300
he may have pointed a finger
of accusation...

342
00:21:59,383 --> 00:22:00,635
At the wrong man.

343
00:22:02,053 --> 00:22:03,012
Oh, my God.

344
00:22:03,638 --> 00:22:07,099
Svenson's sin was sentencing
the wrong man to death.

345
00:22:08,726 --> 00:22:13,022
Did Svenson...? Did Conway ever talk
about who carried out the execution?

346
00:22:15,858 --> 00:22:17,985
They came here once to see Joseph.

347
00:22:18,819 --> 00:22:21,614
It was a group of men and one woman.

348
00:22:22,198 --> 00:22:23,741
I don't know their names.

349
00:22:24,325 --> 00:22:26,869
And I can't remember
what they looked like.

350
00:22:27,995 --> 00:22:30,623
Just that the woman had
the most striking hair.

351
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:35,628
White, save for a cherry-red stripe.

352
00:22:38,714 --> 00:22:40,174
[Betty] Nana Rose Blossom?

353
00:22:44,512 --> 00:22:46,013
[banging on door]

354
00:22:49,058 --> 00:22:49,892
FP?

355
00:22:51,185 --> 00:22:52,937
Well, you're early, old hoss.

356
00:22:58,526 --> 00:22:59,360
Penny.

357
00:23:00,486 --> 00:23:01,696
Ho, merry, ho.

358
00:23:02,113 --> 00:23:04,198
[sighs] Jughead Jones.

359
00:23:04,782 --> 00:23:06,242
Nice crowbar.

360
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,246
This? I brought it
in case I need to pry the door open.

361
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:13,624
Are you gonna give me a hand with this?

362
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:16,711
Your dad will be here in, like, what,
15, 20 minutes?

363
00:23:17,628 --> 00:23:19,464
He probably won't be too happy
to see you, huh?

364
00:23:19,547 --> 00:23:23,134
I wouldn't worry about that.
Neither of us are gonna be here.

365
00:23:26,095 --> 00:23:27,305
[sighs]

366
00:23:27,388 --> 00:23:29,098
Is this supposed to scare me?

367
00:23:31,767 --> 00:23:34,687
I would not do this if I were you.
You are making a big mistake.

368
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:37,190
You are making...
Are you out of your mind?!

369
00:23:42,737 --> 00:23:43,654
Hey, guys.

370
00:23:45,781 --> 00:23:48,117
Finishing up some last-minute shopping?

371
00:23:49,076 --> 00:23:52,997
We were, but then we got
the most fascinating call from our bank,

372
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,752
confirming a charge that was made
to my credit card, the amount of $86,000.

373
00:23:58,628 --> 00:24:00,713
Oh. So that went through.

374
00:24:01,797 --> 00:24:02,632
Great.

375
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:07,428
Yeah, I decided that you would cover
Fred's medical expenses.

376
00:24:08,012 --> 00:24:12,433
I mean, if you can afford to buy Pop's
and then lie to my face about it.

377
00:24:14,185 --> 00:24:18,272
So, how is it that we can now
suddenly afford an entire diner?

378
00:24:21,776 --> 00:24:24,862
[Hiram] You wanted a more active role
in Lodge Industries

379
00:24:24,946 --> 00:24:26,322
and we let you have it.

380
00:24:27,156 --> 00:24:30,993
Then you break into my office and try
to use whatever you find as leverage.

381
00:24:31,077 --> 00:24:35,122
Now, I admit, there's a lot
you don't know, and that's on purpose.

382
00:24:35,206 --> 00:24:38,251
How can I be part of this family
if you keep hiding things from me?

383
00:24:38,334 --> 00:24:41,170
<i>Mija,</i> you think you wanna know everything,
but you don't.

384
00:24:41,254 --> 00:24:44,757
My name is on all of those documents
in your desk, Daddy.

385
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,884
Doesn't that mean
I have the right to know?

386
00:24:46,968 --> 00:24:49,971
Yes, yes, it does, Veronica.

387
00:24:50,972 --> 00:24:54,892
But that means the time
for being daddy's little girl is over.

388
00:24:55,893 --> 00:24:57,103
It's time to work.

389
00:24:58,229 --> 00:25:00,731
All of us in lockstep.

390
00:25:01,315 --> 00:25:02,942
She deserves to know the truth, Hiram.

391
00:25:05,903 --> 00:25:06,737
All right.

392
00:25:08,656 --> 00:25:09,865
All right.

393
00:25:10,449 --> 00:25:12,118
Follow me to the study.

394
00:25:18,165 --> 00:25:19,041
[breathing heavily]

395
00:25:23,462 --> 00:25:25,298
- Where am I?
- You're in Greendale.

396
00:25:26,507 --> 00:25:27,466
Your new home.

397
00:25:28,968 --> 00:25:33,097
But frankly, Penny,
I don't care where you set up shop.

398
00:25:35,266 --> 00:25:39,562
But it's not gonna be in Riverdale,
and it's not gonna be with the Serpents.

399
00:25:40,104 --> 00:25:43,190
You wanna deal drugs?
You wanna extort people?

400
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:44,859
That's your business.

401
00:25:45,693 --> 00:25:48,571
But not on the Southside.
That belongs to us.

402
00:25:48,654 --> 00:25:49,947
[laughing]

403
00:25:50,323 --> 00:25:52,950
You stupid, cocky kid.

404
00:25:55,244 --> 00:25:58,914
The Serpent law says
you can't hurt one of your own.

405
00:26:00,916 --> 00:26:02,918
Oh, Penny, it's time you learn.

406
00:26:05,212 --> 00:26:06,213
Grab her.

407
00:26:08,507 --> 00:26:12,845
What are you doing?
Get off of me! Get off. Get off of me!

408
00:26:14,221 --> 00:26:17,600
- That tattoo doesn't make you a Serpent.
- No, no. [screams]

409
00:26:17,683 --> 00:26:18,726
No, no, no.

410
00:26:25,232 --> 00:26:27,610
Cheryl, we need to see your grandmother.

411
00:26:27,693 --> 00:26:31,614
Nana Rose seldom has visitors.
She'll be pleased. Entree.

412
00:26:35,868 --> 00:26:38,788
[Betty] Nana Rose,
we have some questions for you

413
00:26:38,871 --> 00:26:41,791
about something that happened
in Riverdale a long time ago.

414
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:46,253
A man killed his family,
and a group of people decided

415
00:26:46,337 --> 00:26:49,173
- to take justice into their own hands.
- Oh, dear.

416
00:26:49,256 --> 00:26:51,842
Here in Riverdale?

417
00:26:51,926 --> 00:26:56,305
Yes, and you were part of that group,
weren't you?

418
00:26:56,847 --> 00:27:00,184
- Is this a Christmas inquest?
- A man's life is at stake.

419
00:27:00,976 --> 00:27:03,396
[Betty]
Were you with this group when they...?

420
00:27:03,979 --> 00:27:07,024
When you killed this man for revenge?

421
00:27:07,108 --> 00:27:08,067
Oh, no.

422
00:27:08,651 --> 00:27:10,695
No girls allowed.

423
00:27:10,778 --> 00:27:15,950
They told me to stay at home
while they took care of the bad man.

424
00:27:19,412 --> 00:27:23,624
Nana Rose, this is so important.

425
00:27:24,208 --> 00:27:26,210
Where did they hang the bad man?

426
00:27:26,794 --> 00:27:28,587
Oh, they didn't hang him.

427
00:27:29,505 --> 00:27:32,216
Oh, no. They gave him a proper burial.

428
00:27:33,968 --> 00:27:38,097
Buried him alive.

429
00:27:39,181 --> 00:27:41,308
Where? Where did they do that?

430
00:27:41,976 --> 00:27:45,563
Ask your grandfather, Polly dear.
He was there.

431
00:27:46,147 --> 00:27:48,065
My...? My grandfather?

432
00:27:48,482 --> 00:27:53,320
I had a picture of them
smiling at the place.

433
00:27:53,904 --> 00:27:57,700
Standing under the devil's hands.

434
00:27:58,325 --> 00:28:00,870
Picture? What picture?

435
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,414
Cheryl?

436
00:28:03,998 --> 00:28:07,042
I wonder if you might take me to my room.

437
00:28:07,126 --> 00:28:10,296
I suddenly feel quite ill.

438
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:12,673
[Cheryl] Satisfied, you vultures?

439
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:15,801
Your reindeer games are over.
Now get the hell out.

440
00:28:17,553 --> 00:28:21,932
Archie, my grandfather helped murder
an innocent man.

441
00:28:22,016 --> 00:28:24,059
Betty, who even knows
if what she was saying is true?

442
00:28:24,143 --> 00:28:25,644
That picture Nana Rose mentioned.

443
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:28,439
When Grandpa Louis died,
we packed up his house,

444
00:28:28,522 --> 00:28:29,857
and we donated most of his stuff.

445
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,860
He had pictures.
We kept them and we organized them.

446
00:28:32,943 --> 00:28:36,363
- Take a breath. Where are they?
- They're at my house.

447
00:28:36,447 --> 00:28:38,032
- That's great.
- Archie,

448
00:28:38,115 --> 00:28:42,119
my grandfather killed a man in cold blood.

449
00:28:42,203 --> 00:28:45,289
An innocent man.
What if that's why he picked me?

450
00:28:45,372 --> 00:28:47,625
The Black Hood.
That's why he's been calling me.

451
00:28:47,708 --> 00:28:50,711
- Revenge for something I didn't do.
- Betty, listen.

452
00:28:51,837 --> 00:28:55,257
This is the part... where we end this.

453
00:28:56,175 --> 00:28:59,095
Where we save Mr. Svenson
and stop the Black Hood.

454
00:28:59,178 --> 00:29:02,389
But I need you with me.
I can't do this alone.

455
00:29:02,473 --> 00:29:05,851
Tomorrow, we're gonna wake up and
everything is gonna go back to how it was.

456
00:29:05,935 --> 00:29:08,104
But right now, I need you with me.

457
00:29:08,479 --> 00:29:10,397
- I need Betty Cooper.
- Arch.

458
00:29:18,155 --> 00:29:19,115
Betty.

459
00:29:20,032 --> 00:29:21,033
We have to hurry.

460
00:29:37,374 --> 00:29:38,709
[Hermione] Well, Veronica.

461
00:29:39,585 --> 00:29:40,669
Now you know.

462
00:29:40,753 --> 00:29:42,046
You know everything.

463
00:29:42,671 --> 00:29:44,548
So, <i>mija,</i> what do you think?

464
00:29:50,346 --> 00:29:51,180
I'm in.

465
00:29:51,263 --> 00:29:53,099
But I have ground rules.

466
00:29:53,557 --> 00:29:54,391
Well...

467
00:29:55,184 --> 00:29:56,143
one ground rule.

468
00:29:57,186 --> 00:29:58,020
By all means.

469
00:29:59,522 --> 00:30:02,733
- I refuse to do anything illegal.
- [Hermione] Well, that's fine.

470
00:30:03,526 --> 00:30:06,695
Especially since we're not doing
anything illegal either.

471
00:30:07,947 --> 00:30:09,990
Let me share two words to live by.

472
00:30:11,408 --> 00:30:12,910
Plausible deniability.

473
00:30:13,452 --> 00:30:18,082
Also... that charge I made
for Fred's medical bills?

474
00:30:18,666 --> 00:30:21,794
- I want that to stick.
- It's gonna complicate matters.

475
00:30:21,877 --> 00:30:25,506
- Fred is a proud man. He's not...
- We'll smooth that over.

476
00:30:25,589 --> 00:30:28,717
And the truth is, we'll need Fred
for what comes next.

477
00:30:29,385 --> 00:30:32,930
Fine. Assuming the Fred situation
can be finessed...

478
00:30:35,391 --> 00:30:36,642
do we have a deal?

479
00:30:37,601 --> 00:30:38,936
We do, Daddykins.

480
00:30:40,688 --> 00:30:41,605
We have a deal.

481
00:30:46,026 --> 00:30:47,903
- [Jughead] <i>Hey, Dad.</i>
- [FP] <i>What's all this?</i>

482
00:30:47,987 --> 00:30:51,115
This is a celebratory dinner.

483
00:30:53,701 --> 00:30:56,078
Penny didn't show up
for your pickup, did she?

484
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:57,913
No.

485
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,667
No, she didn't. Why?
Do you know something about that?

486
00:31:02,501 --> 00:31:03,752
She's gone, Dad.

487
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:08,007
I rallied the younger Serpents.
We drove her out of Riverdale.

488
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:10,968
- I got my pound of flesh in the process.
- Are you nuts?!

489
00:31:11,468 --> 00:31:14,180
- She'll be back. Better believe that.
- She won't!

490
00:31:14,722 --> 00:31:16,307
I was very persuasive.

491
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:20,269
And even if she does,
we will take care of it.

492
00:31:20,811 --> 00:31:22,980
You and me and the other Serpents.

493
00:31:23,731 --> 00:31:25,441
In unity, there is strength.

494
00:31:25,524 --> 00:31:30,154
That's the sixth law. While you were
in jail, I recited that. I lived by that.

495
00:31:31,989 --> 00:31:36,118
You wanna take my jacket? You wanna
relegate me to Toys for Tots? Fine.

496
00:31:36,202 --> 00:31:38,662
But I'm still a Serpent, Dad. And this?

497
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,999
This life you wanted to protect me from?

498
00:31:43,918 --> 00:31:45,002
I'm proud of this.

499
00:31:47,296 --> 00:31:49,715
I'm proud of who I am.

500
00:31:50,507 --> 00:31:52,509
You can't take that away from me.

501
00:31:54,887 --> 00:31:57,389
[Betty]

00:32:01,227 --> 00:32:03,896

and some friends

504
00:32:03,979 --> 00:32:06,148
planted some trees in Pickens' Park.

505
00:32:09,276 --> 00:32:10,110
Wait.

506

[Archie] Look at the ground.

508
00:32:13,989 --> 00:32:17,826
That's where they buried the preacher,
where Svenson could be maybe still alive.

509
00:32:18,869 --> 00:32:20,579
Yeah, look at the branches.

510
00:32:20,913 --> 00:32:23,624

- That tree is in Pickens' Park.

Get down or I'll shoot you.
I swear to God, I'll do it.

544
00:35:27,224 --> 00:35:29,393
You tried to kill my father.

545

[Keller] Stay back, Betty.

553
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,385
He's dead.

Your instinct about Svenson was right,
Ronnie. You thought he was the Black Hood.

We could've ended it at school,
where we confronted him.

561

I didn't see it,
I didn't see it in his eyes.

562
00:37:05,414 --> 00:37:09,752
Forget his eyes.
I can't believe he cut off his own finger.

563
00:37:09,835 --> 00:37:11,503
The finger of accusation.

564
00:37:12,087 --> 00:37:15,799
[scoffs] So, we know who done it.
Why did he do it?

565
00:37:15,883 --> 00:37:18,844
Mr. Svenson accused an innocent man

566
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:22,223
of murdering his family
and got the man killed.

567
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:25,768
Maybe in some backwards way,
he thought that targeting sinners

568
00:37:25,851 --> 00:37:27,561
would balance the scales somehow.

569
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:29,188
I don't know.

No, no. It makes sense.

I mean, Svenson was always around,
lurking in the hallways.

572
00:37:35,903 --> 00:37:38,572
He could've seen me and Miss Grundy
in the music room.

573
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:41,075
Yeah, he could have seen Moose
and Midge buying Jingle-Jangle.
