Mrs. Lodge, what a surprise.

168
00:09:50,226 --> 00:09:54,562
You know, I was very moved by your
speech at Midge's funeral, Cheryl.

169
00:09:54,564 --> 00:09:56,890
It came from the core of my bosom.

170
00:09:56,893 --> 00:09:59,300
It's a travesty what happened to Midge.

171
00:09:59,302 --> 00:10:01,585
If only Riverdale had more
competent law enforcement.

172
00:10:01,588 --> 00:10:04,783
Well, I was right in the
middle of writing an editorial,

174

00:10:09,205 --> 00:10:12,480

willing to write an op-ed?

Do you happen to know if Charles' time
here overlapped with Mr. Svenson's?

He was your groundskeeper.

I'm well aware of who Mr.
Svenson was and what he became.

182
00:10:30,466 --> 00:10:33,202
Could we check Charles' files
just to see if the dates match?

184
00:10:34,437 --> 00:10:37,571
I'm sure you have a court
order demanding such a request?

No, we don't.

186
00:10:40,877 --> 00:10:44,116
But I am cousins with Cheryl Blossom,

187
00:10:44,119 --> 00:10:48,382
who recently escaped your
surret, gay re-education camp,

188
00:10:48,384 --> 00:10:52,086
so unless you cooperate, we'll
be back with a court order

189

and the FBI to shut you down.

190
00:10:57,026 --> 00:10:59,260
[JUGHEAD] Apparently, Charles
ran away nine years ago.

191
00:10:59,262 --> 00:11:03,531
That means he would've overlapped
with Svenson for two years at least.

192
00:11:08,336 --> 00:11:12,046
Oh, wait. Uh, Sister, are you
sure this is my brother's file?

Yes, dear, Charles
Smith. That's his photo.

never forget my children.
