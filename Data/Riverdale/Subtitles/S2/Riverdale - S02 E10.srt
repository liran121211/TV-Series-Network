1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,321
Previously on Riverdale...

2
00:00:01,323 --> 00:00:02,844
Bringing the Southside under control

3
00:00:02,846 --> 00:00:04,718
is my number one priority as mayor.

4
00:00:04,721 --> 00:00:08,265
If it means arresting every
single Serpent in sight,

5
00:00:08,268 --> 00:00:09,390
so be it.

6
00:00:09,393 --> 00:00:11,627
How many times are we
gonna push each other away?

7
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:12,829
Until it sticks.

8
00:00:12,832 --> 00:00:14,304
You tried to rape me.

9
00:00:14,307 --> 00:00:16,808
You're not gonna be saying
anything about that night to anyone.

10
00:00:16,811 --> 00:00:19,011
There's a reason it's called hush money.

11
00:00:19,014 --> 00:00:20,764
Thank you for that, Mommy.

12
00:00:20,767 --> 00:00:22,467
Cheryl's telling the truth.

13
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:23,732
Nick tried to do it to me.

14
00:00:23,735 --> 00:00:26,151
Nick St. Clair hurt you?

15
00:00:26,154 --> 00:00:28,362
The St. Clairs' had a car accident.

16
00:00:28,365 --> 00:00:29,696
Karma's a bitch.

17
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:31,657
This is the part where we end this

18
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:32,658
and stop the Black Hood.

19
00:00:32,661 --> 00:00:34,743
But right now, I need you with me.

20
00:00:34,746 --> 00:00:35,878
Arch...

21
00:00:37,487 --> 00:00:39,487
I love you, too, Archie Andrews.

22
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,099
You know how there are just some towns

23
00:00:47,101 --> 00:00:49,799
where bad things always seem to happen?

24
00:00:49,802 --> 00:00:53,453
Well, Riverdale has
become one of those towns.

25
00:00:53,456 --> 00:00:55,237
The most recent horror?

26
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,507
The school janitor turned
out to be a serial killer.

27
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,409
But, we were putting him away

28
00:01:00,411 --> 00:01:02,778
along with our Christmas decorations.

29
00:01:02,781 --> 00:01:07,183
Now we were back to your
typical small town intrigues,

30
00:01:07,186 --> 00:01:10,853
clandestine meetings behind
closed doors and the like.

31
00:01:11,707 --> 00:01:15,200
Yes, by and large, it
was business as usual

32
00:01:15,203 --> 00:01:16,449
in Riverdale.

33
00:01:17,461 --> 00:01:18,928
Good news, Cheryl.

34
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,743
After last night, I've earned
nearly enough to pay for that tree

35
00:01:21,746 --> 00:01:24,180
and those ludicrous presents
you bought for yourself.

36
00:01:24,183 --> 00:01:25,549
Bravo.

37
00:01:26,204 --> 00:01:27,684
Never mind that the last two weeks

38
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:29,772
I've been living in a bordello with, um,

39
00:01:30,477 --> 00:01:31,676
woman of the night.

40
00:01:31,679 --> 00:01:33,976
Oh, it's not that different
from when I was younger,

41
00:01:33,978 --> 00:01:36,412
and I had my pick of gentlemen callers

42
00:01:36,414 --> 00:01:37,913
lining up every evening.

43
00:01:37,915 --> 00:01:39,181
Good God.

44
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:41,270
You almost sound proud.

45
00:01:41,273 --> 00:01:43,552
You wanted me to get a
job, Cheryl, and I did.

46
00:01:43,555 --> 00:01:46,229
Providing comfort and companionship

47
00:01:46,232 --> 00:01:48,499
to the lonely men of Riverdale.

48
00:01:52,552 --> 00:01:54,192
Veronica, do you have a minute?

49
00:01:54,195 --> 00:01:55,331
Just checking in.

50
00:01:55,334 --> 00:01:56,866
See how you're feeling about things.

51
00:01:56,868 --> 00:01:58,387
Ah. Checking in to make sure

52
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,203
I'm still on board with
the quote unquote plan?

53
00:02:01,206 --> 00:02:02,605
Don't worry, I am.

54
00:02:02,607 --> 00:02:04,684
You're gonna be at
ground-zero, Veronica.

55
00:02:04,687 --> 00:02:06,520
Yeah, in the eye of
the potential hurricane.

56
00:02:06,523 --> 00:02:08,946
That's what you said when I
wanted to go shopping in SoHo

57
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:11,977
during Occupy Wall
Street, and I was fine.

58
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,980
Dad. Mom. Trust me.

59
00:02:13,983 --> 00:02:17,242
I'll keep my classmates from
revolting when the news breaks.

60
00:02:17,245 --> 00:02:18,577
And they'll be none the wiser.

61
00:02:24,795 --> 00:02:26,128
Hey, Arch.

62
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:29,250
Did you say anything to
anybody about my medical bill?

63
00:02:29,253 --> 00:02:32,923
'Cause it's been paid, all $86,000.

64
00:02:32,926 --> 00:02:35,026
There was something
called an "angel donation."

65
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,295
No.

66
00:02:36,298 --> 00:02:37,978
Well, I mean, Veronica,
but she wouldn't...

67
00:02:40,811 --> 00:02:41,965
Yeah, I'll ask her at...

68
00:02:41,968 --> 00:02:43,235
No, I'll get to the bottom of it,

69
00:02:43,237 --> 00:02:44,937
you just focus on school.

70
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,442
Haven't seen that guitar for a while.

71
00:02:47,445 --> 00:02:49,210
Yeah, well, I've been busy.

72
00:02:49,213 --> 00:02:50,846
But I spent a lot of break writing songs

73
00:02:50,848 --> 00:02:52,348
and I was thinking I
would maybe start a band,

74
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,516
like the Fred Heads.

75
00:02:53,518 --> 00:02:55,551
If you're gonna do that,
do that in the garage.

76
00:02:55,553 --> 00:02:57,253
That's why I soundproofed it for you.

77
00:03:13,504 --> 00:03:15,137
Ronnie...

78
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,250
- Hey.
- Hey.

79
00:03:16,253 --> 00:03:18,640
Did you tell anyone about
my dad's hospital bill?

80
00:03:18,643 --> 00:03:20,309
Hmm, did I?

81
00:03:20,312 --> 00:03:23,525
I may have mentioned it to
my mom and dad in passing.

82
00:03:24,448 --> 00:03:26,515
- Ronnie...
- They wanted to help.

83
00:03:26,517 --> 00:03:28,450
And they have the means to help.

84
00:03:28,453 --> 00:03:30,286
What, is your dad upset?

85
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:31,554
Are you?

86
00:03:31,557 --> 00:03:32,990
Upset?

87
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:36,090
Ronnie...

88
00:03:36,093 --> 00:03:38,394
I'm crazy about you.

89
00:03:50,164 --> 00:03:52,203
Students of Riverdale High,

90
00:03:52,206 --> 00:03:53,572
this is your principal speaking.

91
00:03:53,575 --> 00:03:56,200
E-mails have been sent to your parents,

92
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:58,113
but effective immediately,

93
00:03:58,116 --> 00:04:00,816
Southside High School is shut down.

94
00:04:00,818 --> 00:04:02,451
And its students

95
00:04:02,454 --> 00:04:04,620
will be transferred to other
schools in the district,

96
00:04:04,622 --> 00:04:06,342
- including this one.
- Oh, my God.

97
00:04:06,345 --> 00:04:07,839
I believe the statement
we're releasing...

98
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:10,187
- Okay, guys, let's not overreact.
- Will address your concerns

99
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:11,355
and theirs.

100
00:04:11,358 --> 00:04:13,790
You should be receiving it shortly.

101
00:04:13,793 --> 00:04:16,498
I'm sure you have many questions.

102
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,635
Like what the hell?

103
00:04:17,638 --> 00:04:19,004
But it goes without saying,

104
00:04:19,007 --> 00:04:21,437
we are welcoming these
students with open minds,

105
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:22,871
hearts and arms.

106
00:04:22,873 --> 00:04:23,906
Cheryl?

107
00:04:23,908 --> 00:04:24,940
Hell no!

108
00:04:24,942 --> 00:04:27,076
My home life is a Dickensian nightmare.

109
00:04:27,078 --> 00:04:29,497
I won't have school turn into one, too.

110
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,681
course schedules or locker assignments.

111
00:04:32,683 --> 00:04:34,717
Thank you. That is all.

112
00:04:34,719 --> 00:04:36,819
Wait, what does that...
What does that mean?

113
00:04:36,822 --> 00:04:38,593
It means Jughead's coming back.

114
00:04:38,596 --> 00:04:40,556
Betty, are you ready for that?

115
00:04:40,558 --> 00:04:41,590
Of course.

116
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:43,792
We're fine.

117
00:04:44,762 --> 00:04:46,495
But why is this happening now?

118
00:04:46,497 --> 00:04:47,796
Who knows.

119
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:50,733
It's probably some bizarre,
Byzantine town ordinance

120
00:04:50,735 --> 00:04:52,408
we couldn't possibly understand.

121
00:04:52,411 --> 00:04:54,837
And in the meantime,
let's receive these exiles

122
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,805
as if they were our own flesh and blood.

123
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,146
Who's in? Hmm?

124
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:01,744
Wow, Jones. Props to you.

125
00:05:01,747 --> 00:05:04,166
It's very Lovecraftian,

126
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:06,729
which I'm sure was the intention.

127
00:05:06,732 --> 00:05:08,030
But I gotta ask you,

128
00:05:08,033 --> 00:05:09,433
did you write this on a typewriter?

129
00:05:10,282 --> 00:05:11,815
I... Yeah.

130
00:05:11,818 --> 00:05:14,237
I wanted to get into
Lovecraft's headspace.

131
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,399
So, it wasn't like

132
00:05:15,402 --> 00:05:17,807
Betty bought you a manual
typewriter for Christmas

133
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,197
or anything weird like that?

134
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,470
No comment.

135
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:24,580
What's going on?

136
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,035
This hellhole is officially closed!

137
00:05:26,037 --> 00:05:27,869
We're done! No more Southside High!

138
00:05:27,872 --> 00:05:29,105
What? How?

139
00:05:29,108 --> 00:05:31,040
They say it's dangerous
and gonna be quarantined.

140
00:05:31,042 --> 00:05:31,842
Who cares?

141
00:05:31,845 --> 00:05:32,912
We're all going to different schools.

142
00:05:32,914 --> 00:05:34,510
Wait, this doesn't make sense.

143
00:05:34,513 --> 00:05:35,643
Where are you guys going?

144
00:05:35,646 --> 00:05:38,237
Same as you and you and Fangs.

145
00:05:38,983 --> 00:05:40,516
We're going to Riverdale High.

146
00:05:41,986 --> 00:05:44,248
Think of all those
Northside heads to knock.

147
00:05:48,793 --> 00:05:50,795
Thank you, Principal Weatherbee.

148
00:05:50,798 --> 00:05:52,064
Keep me posted.

149
00:05:54,865 --> 00:05:56,098
Well, it's done.

150
00:05:56,101 --> 00:05:57,631
Now watch. Any minute my phone

151
00:05:57,634 --> 00:06:00,427
will start exploding with
calls from outraged parents.

152
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,420
It'll be news for two days.

153
00:06:02,423 --> 00:06:04,573
Look at how fast people stopped
talking about the Black Hood.

154
00:06:04,575 --> 00:06:06,041
Yes, and after a few weeks,

155
00:06:06,043 --> 00:06:09,834
we'll quietly go about purchasing
the land beneath Southside High.

156
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:11,347
And you, Madam Mayor,

157
00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:12,781
will get your commission.

158
00:06:12,784 --> 00:06:16,051
A sizable donation to
your re-election campaign.

159
00:06:23,703 --> 00:06:25,703
Mom? Dad?

160
00:06:54,154 --> 00:06:56,087
All right, whoever you are...

161
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,823
Betty, don't shoot.

162
00:06:57,826 --> 00:06:59,426
- It's just me.
- Oh, my God!

163
00:06:59,429 --> 00:07:01,654
Polly, I almost pepper-sprayed you!

164
00:07:01,657 --> 00:07:03,049
What are you doing home?

165
00:07:03,052 --> 00:07:04,019
I just came to get a few things.

166
00:07:04,021 --> 00:07:05,200
Oh, my God!

167
00:07:05,202 --> 00:07:07,115
What happened to the twins?

168
00:07:07,118 --> 00:07:08,370
I had them, Betty.

169
00:07:08,372 --> 00:07:09,505
You did?

170
00:07:11,675 --> 00:07:13,008
You didn't call us?

171
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,210
Mom'll be crushed that she wasn't there.

172
00:07:15,213 --> 00:07:16,779
- We have to call her.
- No, Betty,

173
00:07:16,781 --> 00:07:18,436
We don't. The leaders of the Farm

174
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,764
think that it's best
if I sever all ties.

175
00:07:19,766 --> 00:07:21,565
The "leaders of the Farm"...

176
00:07:21,568 --> 00:07:23,667
You mean the cult that you joined?

177
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:24,702
It's not a cult.

178
00:07:24,705 --> 00:07:27,206
And at least on the Farm,
there's no stigma on my babies.

179
00:07:27,904 --> 00:07:29,391
You can tell Mom and Dad if you want.

180
00:07:29,393 --> 00:07:31,272
Tell them what? I don't know anything.

181
00:07:31,275 --> 00:07:32,974
Are they healthy? Do they have names?

182
00:07:32,977 --> 00:07:34,343
Juniper and Dagwood.

183
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:36,588
Oh, my God.

184
00:07:36,591 --> 00:07:40,068
Polly, please, okay? Mom
and Dad hurt you, yes.

185
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,123
But what you're doing right now is cruel

186
00:07:42,126 --> 00:07:44,505
and selfish and vindictive.

187
00:07:44,508 --> 00:07:47,176
I'm really sorry, Betty, but I gotta go.

188
00:07:48,112 --> 00:07:50,012
That's mine, by the way.

189
00:07:51,348 --> 00:07:53,949
The Farm probably doesn't
have electricity, anyway.

190
00:08:09,468 --> 00:08:11,133
Archie Andrews?

191
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:14,698
I'm Special Agent Adams with the FBI.

192
00:08:14,701 --> 00:08:17,245
Hi.

193
00:08:17,248 --> 00:08:18,807
Can we take a walk?

194
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,358

195
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:27,569
I always love this park.

196
00:08:27,572 --> 00:08:28,953
Came here every weekend,

197
00:08:28,956 --> 00:08:30,364
played ball with my dad,

198
00:08:30,367 --> 00:08:31,966
ran around with my dog.

199
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,001
You're from Riverdale?

200
00:08:33,004 --> 00:08:34,002
I am.

201
00:08:34,004 --> 00:08:35,404
Born and raised.

202
00:08:35,407 --> 00:08:37,639
That's why I was assigned this case.

203
00:08:37,641 --> 00:08:38,907
What case?

204
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,843
Why do you need to talk to me?

205
00:08:40,846 --> 00:08:43,145
How well do you know Hiram Lodge?

206
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,303
I date his daughter.

207
00:08:45,306 --> 00:08:47,311
We believe Hiram Lodge is conducting

208
00:08:47,314 --> 00:08:49,453
criminal activity here in Riverdale,

209
00:08:49,456 --> 00:08:51,077
with ties to organized crime.

210
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,187
Between your relationship with Veronica

211
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:55,445
and your father's connections
to Lodge Industries,

212
00:08:55,448 --> 00:08:58,416
you're in a unique position
to help us take him down.

213
00:08:58,419 --> 00:08:59,728
Once and for all.

214
00:08:59,731 --> 00:09:01,797
Mr. Lodge is a business man.

215
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,365
Let's talk about that.

216
00:09:05,369 --> 00:09:06,401
A few months ago,

217
00:09:06,403 --> 00:09:08,592
one of Hiram Lodge's business associates

218
00:09:08,595 --> 00:09:10,628
came to visit with his family.

219
00:09:10,631 --> 00:09:11,940
The St. Clairs.

220
00:09:11,943 --> 00:09:15,258
They were going to invest
in Hiram's SoDale project,

221
00:09:15,261 --> 00:09:17,931
but for whatever reason,
the deal fell through.

222
00:09:17,934 --> 00:09:19,701
The St. Clairs went back to New York

223
00:09:19,703 --> 00:09:21,516
and their son, Nicholas,

224
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,639
was soon after admitted
to Columbia Presbyterian

225
00:09:24,641 --> 00:09:26,274
with life-threatening injuries.

226
00:09:26,277 --> 00:09:28,351
You think Mr. Lodge is
responsible for this?

227
00:09:28,354 --> 00:09:29,586
We do.

228
00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:31,145
Veronica is my girlfriend...

229
00:09:31,147 --> 00:09:32,580
And your girlfriend's father

230
00:09:32,582 --> 00:09:35,216
is an extremely dangerous man.

231
00:09:35,218 --> 00:09:36,751
He's hurt people, maybe worse.

232
00:09:36,753 --> 00:09:38,119
What do you expect me to uncover?

233
00:09:38,121 --> 00:09:39,187
Let's keep it simple.

234
00:09:39,189 --> 00:09:40,789
Find out what happened
to Nick St. Clair.

235
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:41,756
The truth.

236
00:09:43,193 --> 00:09:45,493
Then, based on how you
do with that assignment...

237
00:09:45,495 --> 00:09:47,428
I have not agreed to anything.

238
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,730
Anyway, is this even legal,

239
00:09:48,732 --> 00:09:50,565
what you're asking me to do?

240
00:09:51,401 --> 00:09:52,967
Don't you have to talk to my dad first?

241
00:09:52,969 --> 00:09:54,836
He's in business with Hiram Lodge.

242
00:09:54,838 --> 00:09:57,605
For all we know, he's a part
of Hiram's criminal activities.

243
00:09:57,608 --> 00:09:59,540
Get real, my dad is not...

244
00:09:59,543 --> 00:10:00,976
We don't know that,

245
00:10:00,979 --> 00:10:02,076
not for sure.

246
00:10:03,007 --> 00:10:05,675
Maybe if you helped us,
we could be more certain.

247
00:10:07,617 --> 00:10:09,584
Look, I know it's a lot to take in.

248
00:10:11,855 --> 00:10:13,621
Why don't you think
about it and call me?

249
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,732
Well,

250
00:10:24,735 --> 00:10:26,768
that is one mystery solved.

251
00:10:26,771 --> 00:10:28,636
- What?
- It was Hiram

252
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:31,531
and Hermione who paid my hospital bill.

253
00:10:31,534 --> 00:10:33,875
Dad, you can't accept that money.

254
00:10:33,878 --> 00:10:35,610
I already did.

255
00:10:35,612 --> 00:10:37,712
I horse-traded 20% of
Andrews Construction

256
00:10:37,714 --> 00:10:39,714
and covered the 86 grand.
It's a pretty good deal.

257
00:10:39,716 --> 00:10:41,049
What? Dad, no.

258
00:10:41,052 --> 00:10:44,192
Son, I can't take out
another mortgage on the house.

259
00:10:44,195 --> 00:10:46,688
Lodges will let me buy it back,
piece by piece. We're good.

260
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:49,157
That just puts us in deeper with them.

261
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,925
They just bailed me out of a jam.

262
00:10:50,927 --> 00:10:51,960
What's the problem?

263
00:10:56,266 --> 00:10:58,399
Mayor McCoy's obviously hiding something

264
00:10:58,401 --> 00:11:00,201
about this Southside debacle.

265
00:11:01,838 --> 00:11:03,137
Sorry, what?

266
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,340
Schools don't just close overnight.

267
00:11:08,678 --> 00:11:10,278
Mom... Polly...

268
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,713
Oh, have you talked to her?

269
00:11:11,715 --> 00:11:13,014
I've been leaving messages.

270
00:11:13,016 --> 00:11:15,183
I want to make sure she
has everything she needs

271
00:11:15,185 --> 00:11:17,485
and ask her what color she
wants the nursery painted.

272
00:11:18,175 --> 00:11:20,722
Same. No, I was just wondering
if you've heard from her.

273
00:11:20,724 --> 00:11:21,823
No, not in a while.

274
00:11:24,594 --> 00:11:27,028
"Mayor McCoy has deemed Southside High

275
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,863
a public health hazard

276
00:11:28,865 --> 00:11:30,331
due to toxic fumes

277
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:33,134
from the methamphetamine
lab in the basement."

278
00:11:34,437 --> 00:11:36,977
There was no meth. It was
just the jingle-jangle.

279
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,941
So the worm turns and it's
back to Riverdale High, huh?

280
00:11:39,943 --> 00:11:41,409
The way that all this went down,

281
00:11:41,411 --> 00:11:42,610
something smells fishy.

282
00:11:42,612 --> 00:11:45,113
Damn straight, something smells fishy.

283
00:11:45,116 --> 00:11:46,339
You not wanting to admit

284
00:11:46,342 --> 00:11:48,515
the real reason you
don't want to go back.

285
00:11:48,518 --> 00:11:49,753
What do you mean?

286
00:11:50,954 --> 00:11:53,187
Ah, she just walked through the door.

287
00:11:54,902 --> 00:11:56,657
Hey, thanks for meeting with me.

288
00:11:56,659 --> 00:11:58,126
Yeah. no problem, I...

289
00:11:58,129 --> 00:12:01,586
I was gonna reach out
and clear the air before

290
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:05,166
Dr. Beaker awkwardly pairs us
up in chemistry or something.

291
00:12:05,168 --> 00:12:08,269
Actually, I wanted to
meet because I need help.

292
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,241
You remember that baby my
mom put up for adoption?

293
00:12:13,243 --> 00:12:14,675
The Long Lost Cooper Sibling.

294
00:12:14,677 --> 00:12:15,628
Yeah.

295
00:12:15,631 --> 00:12:17,178
I was hoping you could put me in touch

296
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,113
with your social worker, Ms. Weiss,

297
00:12:19,115 --> 00:12:22,316
to see if she can help me find him.

298
00:12:22,319 --> 00:12:23,951
Betty...

299
00:12:23,954 --> 00:12:25,883
Of course, I'll help.

300
00:12:25,886 --> 00:12:28,723
But why the sudden need for a brother?

301
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:33,367
Polly had the twins.

302
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:36,330
And she didn't even
call my mom to tell her.

303
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,633
I know my mom's crazy,

304
00:12:38,635 --> 00:12:42,203
but she's also... really sad.

305
00:12:42,206 --> 00:12:44,961
So, maybe if she found her son,

306
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:47,308
having him in our lives...

307
00:12:48,912 --> 00:12:50,750
I'll send you Ms. Weiss' number.

308
00:12:50,753 --> 00:12:52,447
Thank you, Jug.

309
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,248
As for "clearing the air,"

310
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,218
I'm happy you're gonna
be back at Riverdale High.

311
00:13:00,757 --> 00:13:02,477
Well, thank you for inviting me up.

312
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,753
Not at all, Archie.

313
00:13:03,756 --> 00:13:05,158
There's always room at our table.

314
00:13:05,161 --> 00:13:07,795
I wanted to say thanks for
helping my dad the way you did.

315
00:13:07,797 --> 00:13:10,197
- We were happy to do it.
- He would've done the same for us.

316
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,999
In return, though,

317
00:13:12,002 --> 00:13:14,625
I've put together a welcoming committee

318
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:16,313
for tomorrow's arrivals,

319
00:13:16,316 --> 00:13:19,367
and I'm hoping you'll
stand by my side, Archie.

320
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:22,110
Yeah... Yeah, sure.

321
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,702
Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Lodge,

322
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:27,955
what do you think about
Southside High closing down?

323
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,750
I mean, it's so close
to the SoDale project,

324
00:13:29,752 --> 00:13:32,153
isn't that, like, bad for business?

325
00:13:32,156 --> 00:13:34,288
Drugs, gangs and violence.

326
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,723
That's bad for business, Archie.

327
00:13:35,726 --> 00:13:36,792
Hmm.

328
00:13:36,795 --> 00:13:38,528
So investors like

329
00:13:38,531 --> 00:13:40,842
the St. Clairs are fine with it?

330
00:13:41,931 --> 00:13:44,866
Archie, um, the St. Clairs
aren't investors anymore.

331
00:13:44,868 --> 00:13:45,833
Oh.

332
00:13:45,835 --> 00:13:47,502
Not after what Nick did to Cheryl.

333
00:13:47,504 --> 00:13:49,303
Yeah, whatever happened to that guy?

334
00:13:49,306 --> 00:13:50,805
Did he ever get charged?

335
00:13:50,808 --> 00:13:53,550
You know, we've severed all
ties with the St. Clairs.

336
00:13:53,553 --> 00:13:55,510
I don't think we even called
them after the accident.

337
00:13:55,512 --> 00:13:56,744
Accident?

338
00:13:56,747 --> 00:14:00,211
Yeah, Nick St. Clair had
an accident driving in Vail.

339
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,758
Or was it on the slopes?

340
00:14:02,761 --> 00:14:05,206
You know, I'm not sure.

341
00:14:08,158 --> 00:14:09,423
Is he...

342
00:14:11,227 --> 00:14:12,393
Is he okay?

343
00:14:13,196 --> 00:14:15,149
Well, you know, from all reports,

344
00:14:15,152 --> 00:14:18,699
he's recovered enough to
be back at Greenwich Prep.

345
00:14:18,701 --> 00:14:19,734
Yeah.

346
00:14:19,737 --> 00:14:22,113
Mmm-hmm. And may we
never hear from him again.

347
00:14:22,116 --> 00:14:23,238
Mmm.

348
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,953
Friends.

349
00:14:51,956 --> 00:14:55,602
On behalf of the students and
faculty here at Riverdale High,

350
00:14:55,605 --> 00:14:57,271
welcome to your new school!

351
00:14:57,273 --> 00:14:58,439
To ease this transition,

352
00:14:58,441 --> 00:15:00,107
I've set up a registration desk

353
00:15:00,109 --> 00:15:01,976
where you can get your
locker assignments,

354
00:15:01,979 --> 00:15:05,266
class schedules, and a list
of sports and extracurriculars.

355
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:08,382
We encourage each and every
one of you to drink deeply

356
00:15:08,384 --> 00:15:11,219
from the cup that is fair Riverdale.

357
00:15:11,222 --> 00:15:13,354
Stand down, Eva Peron!

358
00:15:22,365 --> 00:15:24,966
There's the school spirit
I so fondly remember.

359
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,341
Cheryl. No one invited
Fascist Barbie to the party.

360
00:15:34,344 --> 00:15:35,443
Wrong, Veronica,

361
00:15:35,445 --> 00:15:38,112
no one invited Southside
scum to our school.

362
00:15:38,114 --> 00:15:39,664
Listen up, Ragamuffins.

363
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:42,316
I will not allow Riverdale
High's above average GPA

364
00:15:42,318 --> 00:15:45,119
to suffer because of classrooms
that are overcrowded with

365
00:15:45,121 --> 00:15:46,320
underachievers.

366
00:15:46,322 --> 00:15:47,922
So please, do us all a favor,

367
00:15:47,924 --> 00:15:49,156
and find some other school to debase

368
00:15:49,158 --> 00:15:50,891
with your hardscrabble ways.

369
00:15:50,893 --> 00:15:53,794
Why don't you come over
here and say that to my face?

370
00:15:53,796 --> 00:15:56,764
- Happily, Queen of the Buskers.
- Okay... Guys,

371
00:15:56,767 --> 00:16:00,101
everyone, can we just put our
Northside-Southside differences

372
00:16:00,103 --> 00:16:01,569
apart and start over?

373
00:16:01,572 --> 00:16:02,730
A new slate?

374
00:16:02,733 --> 00:16:04,705
Mmm. You don't speak for
the Bulldogs, Andrews.

375
00:16:04,707 --> 00:16:05,840
And need I remind you,

376
00:16:05,842 --> 00:16:07,975
these greaser-snakes
showed up at your place

377
00:16:07,977 --> 00:16:09,176
trying to kick your ass.

378
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:10,792
Happy to finish what was started.

379
00:16:10,795 --> 00:16:13,481
God, I am so over the toxic masculinity

380
00:16:13,483 --> 00:16:14,615
in this hallway right now.

381
00:16:14,617 --> 00:16:17,131
All right. That's enough
pomp and circumstance.

382
00:16:17,134 --> 00:16:19,058
Everyone, let's get to class.

383
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,187
Now.

384
00:16:28,894 --> 00:16:31,132
Nice to see you and
Veronica back together.

385
00:16:32,869 --> 00:16:35,303
Especially considering that
clandestine Christmas kiss

386
00:16:35,305 --> 00:16:37,738
I spied between you and Betty Cooper.

387
00:16:37,741 --> 00:16:40,641
Care to reconsider your allegiance?

388
00:16:51,818 --> 00:16:53,029
Cheryl...

389
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,761
I was unsurprised and quite
pleased to get your text

390
00:16:57,763 --> 00:16:59,696
suggesting this meeting, Archie.

391
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:01,097
I'll keep it brief...

392
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,899
If you don't convince Veronica

393
00:17:02,901 --> 00:17:05,471
to stand with us against
the Southside rabble,

394
00:17:05,474 --> 00:17:08,214
I'll tell her I saw you
locking lips with Betty Cooper.

395
00:17:08,217 --> 00:17:10,217
Veronica and I were broken up, Cheryl.

396
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,819
And so were Jughead and Betty.

397
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,777
Anyway, that's not why I texted you.

398
00:17:13,779 --> 00:17:15,278
Oh, Archie.

399
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,680
Do you really think you're
going to outmaneuver me?

400
00:17:17,683 --> 00:17:19,388
I want to talk about Nick St. Clair.

401
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,700
What on earth for?

402
00:17:24,703 --> 00:17:26,728
Did you know that
after he left Riverdale,

403
00:17:26,731 --> 00:17:28,324
he got into an accident?

404
00:17:28,327 --> 00:17:30,093
Like, a pretty bad car crash?

405
00:17:30,095 --> 00:17:32,865
Forgive me if I don't shed
any tears for that animal.

406
00:17:32,868 --> 00:17:35,031
I only wish Mother and I
wouldn't have burned the check

407
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:36,733
his family gave us as hush money.

408
00:17:38,529 --> 00:17:39,934
You must've been thrilled, too,

409
00:17:39,937 --> 00:17:41,457
when you found out about the accident.

410
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,588
I mean, after what Nick did to
Veronica the night of his party.

411
00:17:44,591 --> 00:17:46,970
- What?
- When he got physical with her.

412
00:17:46,973 --> 00:17:48,115
What do you mean?

413
00:17:48,118 --> 00:17:51,068
I mean, if Veronica wouldn't
have slapped him senseless,

414
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:53,450
the same thing that happened to me

415
00:17:53,453 --> 00:17:55,146
might've happened to her.

416
00:17:58,066 --> 00:18:00,066
I'm going to murder him.

417
00:18:00,069 --> 00:18:01,669
Archie...

418
00:18:01,672 --> 00:18:05,224
I genuinely thought you knew.

419
00:18:06,368 --> 00:18:09,336
It was Veronica's right
to tell you or not.

420
00:18:10,802 --> 00:18:13,803
I'm sure there's a specific
reason she kept it from you.

421
00:18:13,806 --> 00:18:17,083
Yeah, and I think I know what it is.

422
00:18:19,044 --> 00:18:21,377
As is typical in
circumstances like these,

423
00:18:21,379 --> 00:18:23,012
your brother's files were unsealed

424
00:18:23,014 --> 00:18:24,848
and made public when he turned 18.

425
00:18:24,851 --> 00:18:26,649
His name is Charles Smith.

426
00:18:26,652 --> 00:18:29,552
After your mother gave birth
at the Sisters of Quiet Mercy,

427
00:18:29,554 --> 00:18:32,021
he entered and pretty much
stayed in the foster system.

428
00:18:32,023 --> 00:18:33,623
You mean he wasn't adopted?

429
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,091
Unfortunately, no.

430
00:18:35,094 --> 00:18:38,228
The last known address we
have for him is two towns over.

431
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,362
In Centerville.

432
00:18:42,501 --> 00:18:44,740
I don't think we've properly met.

433
00:18:44,743 --> 00:18:45,869
Veronica Lodge.

434
00:18:45,871 --> 00:18:48,627
Of the Park Avenue Lodges.

435
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,840
Toni. Topaz.

436
00:18:50,842 --> 00:18:53,710
Oh, like the purple-colored gemstone.

437
00:18:53,712 --> 00:18:54,777
Love it.

438
00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:56,880
And I'm Josie McCoy.

439
00:18:56,882 --> 00:18:59,015
Formerly of the Pussycats,

440
00:18:59,017 --> 00:19:01,651
now just Josie.

441
00:19:01,654 --> 00:19:03,254
And this is Kevin.

442
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:06,923
- What's your name?
- Fogarty.

443
00:19:06,926 --> 00:19:08,725
Or you can call me Fangs.

444
00:19:08,728 --> 00:19:10,527
Your last name's Keller, right?

445
00:19:10,529 --> 00:19:11,995
How did you know that?

446
00:19:11,997 --> 00:19:13,830
Joaquin and I used to hang out.

447
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,294
He talked about you all the time.

448
00:19:16,796 --> 00:19:18,268
You guys!

449
00:19:18,271 --> 00:19:19,969
Yes, you, come with me.

450
00:19:19,972 --> 00:19:21,138
Now!

451
00:19:33,351 --> 00:19:37,666
Which of you defaced our
school seal with this graffiti?

452
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:40,356
This is what they do,
Principal Weatherbee.

453
00:19:40,358 --> 00:19:42,115
They tag their turf.

454
00:19:42,118 --> 00:19:45,562
My God, Reggie, could you
be anymore transparent?

455
00:19:45,565 --> 00:19:47,497
Effective immediately,

456
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,832
no gang behavior of any kind
will be tolerated at my school.

457
00:19:50,835 --> 00:19:53,703
As of this moment, no
more Serpent jackets.

458
00:19:53,705 --> 00:19:56,239
- What?
- No more Serpent jackets!

459
00:19:56,857 --> 00:19:58,362
All tattoos are gonna be covered.

460
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:01,244
Possession of any gang
paraphernalia whatsoever

461
00:20:01,247 --> 00:20:03,271
will lead to immediate suspension.

462
00:20:03,274 --> 00:20:04,614
Are we clear?

463
00:20:06,418 --> 00:20:07,684
That's all.

464
00:20:12,027 --> 00:20:13,560
Mom. Dad.

465
00:20:17,357 --> 00:20:18,990
Polly had the twins.

466
00:20:18,993 --> 00:20:20,196
What?

467
00:20:20,198 --> 00:20:21,575
I don't understand.

468
00:20:21,578 --> 00:20:23,505
- She...
- I do.

469
00:20:23,508 --> 00:20:25,902
I understand. She didn't...

470
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:30,039
Doesn't want us to be a
part of the babies' lives.

471
00:20:32,926 --> 00:20:34,326
Isn't that right, Betty?

472
00:20:35,747 --> 00:20:37,614
Well, are they healthy?

473
00:20:37,617 --> 00:20:39,716
- Is Polly all right?
- Yeah.

474
00:20:39,718 --> 00:20:41,541
She is,

475
00:20:41,544 --> 00:20:43,119
and they are.

476
00:20:46,024 --> 00:20:47,256
Good.

477
00:20:48,994 --> 00:20:50,393
There's something else.

478
00:20:50,396 --> 00:20:51,828
I did some digging,

479
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:54,622
and I found an address

480
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,599
for your son,

481
00:20:56,602 --> 00:20:58,234
my brother.

482
00:20:58,237 --> 00:21:00,760
His name is Charles.

483
00:21:00,763 --> 00:21:03,106
Betty, what are you talking about?

484
00:21:03,108 --> 00:21:06,042
I, I thought it might
help, now that Polly's...

485
00:21:06,044 --> 00:21:09,045
No! This has nothing to do with Polly,

486
00:21:09,048 --> 00:21:10,513
- or you!
- Okay, Hal.

487
00:21:10,515 --> 00:21:12,949
I did it for Mom, Dad.

488
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,352
Mom?

489
00:21:19,357 --> 00:21:20,823
Your father's right.

490
00:21:26,274 --> 00:21:27,573
Okay.

491
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,107
I can't believe you
guys don't even see it.

492
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:33,115
Weatherbee is profiling us.

493
00:21:34,439 --> 00:21:36,205
Tellin' us what to wear.

494
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:37,349
What's next?

495
00:21:37,352 --> 00:21:39,142
Brain implants
controlling what we think?

496
00:21:39,144 --> 00:21:41,310
Jughead, you sound like
a crazy conspiracy nut.

497
00:21:41,313 --> 00:21:43,179
A school closed down.

498
00:21:43,181 --> 00:21:44,247
A crappy school.

499
00:21:44,249 --> 00:21:46,215
Yeah, and now we're at a better one.

500
00:21:46,217 --> 00:21:48,251
The computer lab and text books...

501
00:21:48,253 --> 00:21:49,452
And toilets that flush.

502
00:21:49,454 --> 00:21:51,087
Getting transferred to Riverdale High

503
00:21:51,089 --> 00:21:52,655
is the best thing that
could have happened.

504
00:21:52,657 --> 00:21:53,497
Maybe ever.

505
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,318
So, if I have to take off my jacket,

506
00:21:55,321 --> 00:21:57,493
8:30 to 3:00, Monday through Friday...

507
00:21:57,495 --> 00:21:59,395
Hey, I'm down with that.

508
00:22:06,404 --> 00:22:07,804
My dad soundproofed this garage

509
00:22:07,806 --> 00:22:09,305
so I could practice my music.

510
00:22:09,308 --> 00:22:11,325
Maybe you'll get back
to it when this is over.

511
00:22:12,744 --> 00:22:14,277
You said you had something for me?

512
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:15,445
Yeah.

513
00:22:16,614 --> 00:22:21,117
Nick was hurt badly in some
kind of accident in Vail.

514
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,240
At least according to the Lodges.

515
00:22:24,122 --> 00:22:25,621
But it may not have been an accident.

516
00:22:25,623 --> 00:22:26,489
What do you mean?

517
00:22:26,491 --> 00:22:27,824
Before I say anything else,

518
00:22:27,826 --> 00:22:29,559
I need some assurance from you,

519
00:22:29,562 --> 00:22:31,194
that no matter what
happens to Mr. Lodge,

520
00:22:31,196 --> 00:22:32,462
my dad is gonna be okay.

521
00:22:32,464 --> 00:22:34,197
That he's not gonna go to jail.

522
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,839
I can protect your father.

523
00:22:37,741 --> 00:22:39,941
Nick assaulted Veronica.

524
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:42,605
If Mr. Lodge found that out...

525
00:22:42,607 --> 00:22:43,740
It would give him a motive.

526
00:22:43,742 --> 00:22:44,941
He'd want payback.

527
00:22:44,943 --> 00:22:46,576
Can you get confirmation
from his daughter?

528
00:22:46,578 --> 00:22:48,947
No, no way, I am not using Veronica.

529
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,622
But I might be able to get to Nick.

530
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:51,816
That's smart.

531
00:22:51,819 --> 00:22:53,596
He's more likely to talk
to you than he is to me.

532
00:22:53,598 --> 00:22:54,817
Yeah, but there's a problem.

533
00:22:54,819 --> 00:22:55,872
If I go to Nick,

534
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,787
what if he tells Veronica that
I was asking about the accident?

535
00:22:57,789 --> 00:23:00,674
Or he tells his parents
and they tell Mr. Lodge?

536
00:23:00,677 --> 00:23:02,525
You need a Trojan horse.

537
00:23:02,528 --> 00:23:04,302
A cover story.

538
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:08,557
A reason to see Nick that has
nothing to do with the Lodges.

539
00:23:10,435 --> 00:23:11,834
Can you think of anything?

540
00:23:13,544 --> 00:23:14,877
Maybe, yeah.

541
00:23:22,389 --> 00:23:23,722
What do you want, Archie?

542
00:23:23,725 --> 00:23:26,102
I can't stop thinking about
what Nick did to Veronica,

543
00:23:26,105 --> 00:23:27,238
and to you.

544
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:29,152
Cheryl, that check you threw away,

545
00:23:29,154 --> 00:23:30,787
do you want another one from Nick?

546
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,488
I mean, of course I'd take it,

547
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:35,424
but I'm afraid the
ship's sailed on that one.

548
00:23:35,426 --> 00:23:36,626
Really?

549
00:23:36,628 --> 00:23:38,694
Because I was thinking
of going to see Nick

550
00:23:38,696 --> 00:23:40,329
and I could ask him for you.

551
00:23:40,332 --> 00:23:42,159
And I bet he'd give it to me.

552
00:23:43,468 --> 00:23:45,501
I just need to borrow
one of Jason's blazers.

553
00:23:55,313 --> 00:23:56,579
Mom?

554
00:23:59,484 --> 00:24:02,385
We can't tell your father
'cause he wouldn't support it.

555
00:24:03,788 --> 00:24:05,288
But I want to see him, Betty.

556
00:24:07,062 --> 00:24:08,595
I wanna see my son.

557
00:24:34,271 --> 00:24:36,751
Oh, hey, guys, what's up?

558
00:24:40,585 --> 00:24:41,717
Take it off.

559
00:24:45,356 --> 00:24:48,457
Take off that jacket, Rat Boy.

560
00:24:52,563 --> 00:24:53,829
Oh, Reggie.

561
00:24:54,832 --> 00:24:56,944
I don't think you know
what this jacket means.

562
00:24:56,947 --> 00:24:58,834
Because you have no sense of honor.

563
00:24:58,836 --> 00:24:59,935
Or history,

564
00:24:59,937 --> 00:25:01,580
- or loyalty.
- That's it.

565
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,579
Oh, my God.

566
00:25:12,275 --> 00:25:13,749
Mr. Weatherbee...

567
00:25:14,627 --> 00:25:16,387
You all have a week's
detention for fighting.

568
00:25:21,133 --> 00:25:23,586
But I made myself
clear to you, Mr. Jones.

569
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:26,056
Take off that jacket, right
now, or you're suspended.

570
00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:29,097
- Please, Jughead, just...
- Then I guess I'm suspended.

571
00:25:44,282 --> 00:25:46,615
Weatherbee told McCoy who told us

572
00:25:46,617 --> 00:25:48,417
the integration is not going well.

573
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:50,919
Reggie's just being Reggie,

574
00:25:50,922 --> 00:25:54,298
but he has made gang-wear a flashpoint.

575
00:25:54,301 --> 00:25:57,202
The Southsiders need to
start looking the part.

576
00:25:57,205 --> 00:25:59,128
So I propose

577
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:02,631
a charitable donation to help
out the fashionably misguided.

578
00:26:13,411 --> 00:26:14,543
Hi.

579
00:26:15,259 --> 00:26:18,113
$40 a night for a single
bed, $20 for a bunk.

580
00:26:18,116 --> 00:26:20,115
Oh, uh, we're actually
looking for someone.

581
00:26:20,117 --> 00:26:22,095
His name is Charles Smith.

582
00:26:22,098 --> 00:26:23,218
Do you know him?

583
00:26:24,955 --> 00:26:26,255
237.

584
00:26:58,789 --> 00:27:00,522
It's okay, Mom.

585
00:27:03,828 --> 00:27:05,060
Come in.

586
00:27:10,849 --> 00:27:12,282
Charles?

587
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:13,802
Charles,

588
00:27:13,805 --> 00:27:15,938
my name's Alice Cooper.

589
00:27:16,907 --> 00:27:19,041
This is my daughter, Betty.

590
00:27:20,578 --> 00:27:21,710
We're...

591
00:27:22,813 --> 00:27:24,146
- I'm...
- I know who you are.

592
00:27:25,549 --> 00:27:28,217
The Sisters gave me your
address when I turned 18.

593
00:27:28,986 --> 00:27:30,619
When they kicked me out.

594
00:27:32,022 --> 00:27:33,889
I even went by your house once.

595
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,093
Must be a nice place to grow up.

596
00:27:39,554 --> 00:27:41,248
You didn't want to come in?

597
00:27:41,251 --> 00:27:42,952
Meet us?

598
00:27:42,955 --> 00:27:45,567
Got the feeling you probably
didn't want somebody like me around.

599
00:27:45,569 --> 00:27:46,602
That's not true.

600
00:27:47,805 --> 00:27:49,104
You're my sister?

601
00:27:51,342 --> 00:27:53,342
Yeah... Yes.

602
00:27:53,344 --> 00:27:55,544
Well, you're lucky
she wanted to keep you.

603
00:27:56,514 --> 00:27:57,479
Charles...

604
00:27:57,481 --> 00:27:58,889
It's Chic.

605
00:27:58,892 --> 00:28:00,716
But how would you know that?

606
00:28:00,719 --> 00:28:02,651
You know what, forget it.

607
00:28:02,654 --> 00:28:04,595
You have to go. I have
a client on the way.

608
00:28:09,493 --> 00:28:11,049
What kind of work do you do?

609
00:28:11,052 --> 00:28:12,451
Are you for real?

610
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:15,209
Fantasy fulfillment.

611
00:28:15,212 --> 00:28:16,941
Now, really, you have to go.

612
00:28:19,303 --> 00:28:20,335
Come on, Mom.

613
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,674
Now, you break that, you buy it.

614
00:29:00,845 --> 00:29:02,010
How'd you know I was here?

615
00:29:02,012 --> 00:29:03,053
Hog Eye called me.

616
00:29:03,056 --> 00:29:04,822
- What's up, Hog Eye?
- FP.

617
00:29:05,501 --> 00:29:08,039
You wanna explain to me why
the hell you're not in school?

618
00:29:08,042 --> 00:29:09,051
Yes.

619
00:29:10,087 --> 00:29:12,654
Weatherbee has been
disrespecting the Serpents.

620
00:29:12,657 --> 00:29:14,056
He's been targeting us.

621
00:29:15,012 --> 00:29:16,877
He told us to take off our skins.

622
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,577
You mean your jackets?

623
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,062
Wear them after school.

624
00:29:20,064 --> 00:29:21,497
"A Serpent never sheds its skin."

625
00:29:21,499 --> 00:29:23,065
I know the laws, boy.

626
00:29:25,302 --> 00:29:27,045
What's goin' on, Jug?

627
00:29:27,048 --> 00:29:29,004
Really?

628
00:29:31,628 --> 00:29:33,709
Southside High, we had a place.

629
00:29:33,712 --> 00:29:36,778
Yeah, it was crappy, but it was ours.

630
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,246
We were a family.

631
00:29:38,249 --> 00:29:39,889
We had a home.

632
00:29:39,892 --> 00:29:42,149
I had a home.

633
00:29:42,152 --> 00:29:43,452
Yeah, I hear you.

634
00:29:45,356 --> 00:29:48,056
But getting arrested for
truancy's not gonna help.

635
00:29:48,058 --> 00:29:49,324
You gotta be smart.

636
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:53,420
Serpents hibernate during the winter.

637
00:29:53,423 --> 00:29:56,265
Look at me, you think
I like cleaning toilets,

638
00:29:56,267 --> 00:29:58,092
shoveling slop? No.

639
00:29:58,095 --> 00:29:59,884
But it's what I gotta do.

640
00:29:59,887 --> 00:30:03,272
Going to Riverdale High,
that's what you gotta do.

641
00:30:05,142 --> 00:30:07,045
So lay low for a while,

642
00:30:07,048 --> 00:30:09,908
but you never stop being a Serpent.

643
00:30:20,591 --> 00:30:21,890
Hey, Nick.

644
00:30:22,693 --> 00:30:24,092
Nice dorm room.

645
00:30:26,064 --> 00:30:27,595
What are you doing here?

646
00:30:29,833 --> 00:30:31,333
And why are you wearing that blazer?

647
00:30:33,971 --> 00:30:35,811
You remember Cheryl Blossom?

648
00:30:35,814 --> 00:30:38,483
You wrote her a check...
Covering damages?

649
00:30:38,486 --> 00:30:40,409
Well, that check got lost.

650
00:30:41,211 --> 00:30:42,970
So you're going to write it again.

651
00:30:42,973 --> 00:30:44,746
Right now. For double.

652
00:30:45,824 --> 00:30:48,424
That's it? Money?

653
00:30:49,954 --> 00:30:51,353
Checkbook's in the desk.

654
00:30:57,736 --> 00:30:59,227
I heard you got hurt pretty bad.

655
00:30:59,229 --> 00:31:00,262
How'd that happen?

656
00:31:01,131 --> 00:31:02,264
Ski accident.

657
00:31:02,267 --> 00:31:03,365
Ski accident?

658
00:31:04,268 --> 00:31:06,097
Wow. You must really
suck at skiing, Nick.

659
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:09,668
So, what, you wiped out on the
slopes and snapped both your legs?

660
00:31:11,075 --> 00:31:13,141
Yeah, I wiped out on the slopes, Archie.

661
00:31:13,143 --> 00:31:14,276
What the hell do you care?

662
00:31:16,447 --> 00:31:19,881
I don't care, I'm just curious.

663
00:31:19,884 --> 00:31:20,879
You know what's weird?

664
00:31:20,882 --> 00:31:23,551
You come to Riverdale,
act like a jackass,

665
00:31:23,554 --> 00:31:25,020
try to rape Cheryl,

666
00:31:25,022 --> 00:31:26,088
and blow up some big deal

667
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:27,293
between the Lodges and your folks

668
00:31:27,295 --> 00:31:29,228
and then skip back down to Vail

669
00:31:29,231 --> 00:31:30,913
for some little ski weekend?

670
00:31:31,929 --> 00:31:33,494
I don't know, it seems weird.

671
00:31:35,432 --> 00:31:36,698
You're not here for Cheryl.

672
00:31:38,902 --> 00:31:40,035
Yes, I am.

673
00:31:41,271 --> 00:31:44,220
I'm here to get what
you owe her, you scumbag.

674
00:31:44,223 --> 00:31:46,876
I don't even remember you
being friends with Cheryl.

675
00:31:46,879 --> 00:31:49,144
Probably because you were
high the entire time, Nick.

676
00:31:49,146 --> 00:31:50,679
Why are you really here, Archie?

677
00:31:52,116 --> 00:31:53,148
For Ronnie?

678
00:31:55,085 --> 00:31:56,330
Payback

679
00:31:56,333 --> 00:31:59,521
for what you did to Cheryl and Veronica.

680
00:31:59,524 --> 00:32:00,861
Payback? No.

681
00:32:01,959 --> 00:32:03,358
No, you know what I think?

682
00:32:04,128 --> 00:32:05,894
I think you're a small town hick

683
00:32:05,897 --> 00:32:07,150
who's beginning to realize

684
00:32:07,153 --> 00:32:10,173
how deep into shark-infested
waters he really is.

685
00:32:11,201 --> 00:32:12,486
Careful,

686
00:32:12,489 --> 00:32:14,592
when Veronica Lodge smells blood,

687
00:32:14,595 --> 00:32:16,238
she'll turn on you, too.

688
00:32:33,924 --> 00:32:35,490
What the hell?

689
00:32:35,493 --> 00:32:36,692
Guys...

690
00:32:39,163 --> 00:32:41,263
Weatherbee gave them to us.

691
00:32:41,265 --> 00:32:44,366
Said he understood that
not every Southside student

692
00:32:44,368 --> 00:32:45,968
had the means to purchase

693
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:48,691
Riverdale High acceptable clothes.

694
00:32:48,694 --> 00:32:51,006
He thinks this will help us fit in.

695
00:32:51,009 --> 00:32:52,241
Where's Fogarty?

696
00:32:52,243 --> 00:32:53,474
He wouldn't wear the uniform,

697
00:32:53,477 --> 00:32:55,410
so they got rid of him, suspended him.

698
00:32:55,413 --> 00:32:58,422
So our choices are
conform or be cast out.

699
00:32:58,425 --> 00:32:59,458
Yeah.

700
00:33:04,889 --> 00:33:06,789
"FYI,

701
00:33:06,792 --> 00:33:10,359
your insane boyfriend just
ambushed me in my dorm room.

702
00:33:10,362 --> 00:33:13,495
He broke my nose and
was foaming at the mouth.

703
00:33:13,497 --> 00:33:15,347
Hope you've had your shots."

704
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,432
I can explain that.

705
00:33:16,434 --> 00:33:18,133
By all means, Archie,

706
00:33:18,136 --> 00:33:20,135
I would love to hear
why you went to New York

707
00:33:20,137 --> 00:33:21,756
behind my back

708
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:24,006
and attacked Nick St. Clair.

709
00:33:24,008 --> 00:33:25,641
I wanted to beat the hell out of him

710
00:33:25,643 --> 00:33:28,576
after what he did to you
after that stupid party!

711
00:33:28,579 --> 00:33:29,878
Who told you about that?

712
00:33:29,881 --> 00:33:33,115
Because the only people that
know are me, Nick, and...

713
00:33:33,117 --> 00:33:34,483
I did.

714
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,086
I told him.

715
00:33:37,089 --> 00:33:40,625
I told Archie the truth about
that staph-infection for a human.

716
00:33:40,628 --> 00:33:43,592
And... I convinced him
to pay Nick a visit.

717
00:33:43,595 --> 00:33:45,461
Cheryl, why would you do that?

718
00:33:45,464 --> 00:33:47,269
Classic shake-down.

719
00:33:47,272 --> 00:33:48,561
I wanted money from Nick,

720
00:33:48,564 --> 00:33:50,199
and I thought Archie could convince him

721
00:33:50,201 --> 00:33:51,441
that reparations were in order.

722
00:33:53,104 --> 00:33:54,967
My only regret

723
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:57,673
is that I betrayed your
confidence, Veronica.

724
00:33:58,943 --> 00:34:01,913
And for that, I'm sorry.

725
00:34:05,916 --> 00:34:07,349
Hey...

726
00:34:09,387 --> 00:34:11,050
I'm sorry, too.

727
00:34:11,053 --> 00:34:12,802
I should've told you.

728
00:34:48,494 --> 00:34:49,526
Hey!

729
00:34:50,795 --> 00:34:52,094
- Let go of him!
- Ahhh!

730
00:34:52,797 --> 00:34:54,630
I said let go of my brother!

731
00:34:56,467 --> 00:34:57,466
Come on.

732
00:35:06,077 --> 00:35:07,710
Something's off with you.

733
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,080
- Huh?
- I mean, call it girlfriend's intuition, but,

734
00:35:11,083 --> 00:35:12,748
you're hiding something.

735
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:17,820
I wanted revenge for
what Nick did to you,

736
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,483
that's true, okay? I swear.

737
00:35:23,391 --> 00:35:24,962
But there is one thing I left out...

738
00:35:24,965 --> 00:35:26,298
I knew it.

739
00:35:26,864 --> 00:35:28,097
What?

740
00:35:29,985 --> 00:35:32,386
The reason I visited
Nick in the first place.

741
00:35:36,508 --> 00:35:38,273
Cheryl was blackmailing me.

742
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:41,043
Pardonne-moi, blackmailing you?

743
00:35:41,046 --> 00:35:42,377
How?

744
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,688
On the night of the Black Hood...

745
00:35:44,691 --> 00:35:46,430
Cheryl saw...

746
00:35:49,928 --> 00:35:52,024
Cheryl saw me and Betty kiss.

747
00:35:52,027 --> 00:35:53,288
What?

748
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:54,389
When?

749
00:35:54,392 --> 00:35:55,691
Why? And how?

750
00:35:55,693 --> 00:35:56,859
It was after you dumped me

751
00:35:56,861 --> 00:35:58,327
and Jughead just dumped Betty.

752
00:35:58,329 --> 00:35:59,461
Nana Rose had just told us

753
00:35:59,463 --> 00:36:01,263
this crazy story about
Betty's grandfather

754
00:36:01,265 --> 00:36:02,197
and it just happened.

755
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:04,867
You and Betty... kissed?

756
00:36:04,869 --> 00:36:07,236
It was that crazy,
out-of-control night, Ronnie.

757
00:36:07,238 --> 00:36:08,937
Literally 40 minutes later,

758
00:36:08,939 --> 00:36:11,006
the Black Hood was burying me alive.

759
00:36:13,975 --> 00:36:18,287
You and Betty... kissed.

760
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:20,215
We haven't talked about it since.

761
00:36:20,218 --> 00:36:23,118
I don't think either of us are
ever gonna talk about it again.

762
00:36:35,907 --> 00:36:37,173
It's okay.

763
00:36:38,369 --> 00:36:39,735
Do you know why?

764
00:36:39,738 --> 00:36:41,403
Because I believe you.

765
00:36:41,406 --> 00:36:43,458
You're being honest with me,

766
00:36:43,461 --> 00:36:46,107
and that's more important than a single,

767
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:48,510
my-life's-in-danger kiss.

768
00:36:49,847 --> 00:36:51,680
I love you, Ronnie.

769
00:36:52,716 --> 00:36:54,049
I love you, too.

770
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:03,926
Mom! Dad!

771
00:37:03,928 --> 00:37:04,827
I need help.

772
00:37:04,829 --> 00:37:06,261
Betty, What happened?

773
00:37:27,038 --> 00:37:28,620
Welcome to the inaugural meeting

774
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,363
of the Swords and Serpents Club.

775
00:37:30,365 --> 00:37:32,172
Which is what, exactly?

776
00:37:32,175 --> 00:37:35,587
Like I told Fogarty to lure
him back to dear ol' Riverdale,

777
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:37,560
we are a gaming group.

778
00:37:37,563 --> 00:37:40,406
Sanctioned by Mr. Weatherbee, himself.

779
00:37:40,409 --> 00:37:43,376
Where like-minded students
can meet and concoct

780
00:37:43,379 --> 00:37:46,052
world-building,
role-playing scenarios,

781
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:49,247
inhabiting fantastical heroes and

782
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:51,384
dispatching mythological creatures.

783
00:37:51,386 --> 00:37:53,452
No, but really?

784
00:37:53,454 --> 00:37:54,920
It's a club,

785
00:37:54,923 --> 00:37:56,389
for us.

786
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:58,457
A safe haven

787
00:37:58,459 --> 00:38:00,259
where we can be Serpents,
during school hours

788
00:38:00,261 --> 00:38:01,861
and under everyone's noses.

789
00:38:02,563 --> 00:38:04,096
We're not shedding our skins.

790
00:38:06,601 --> 00:38:09,535
We're lying low, in the tall grass.

791
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,707
I've solved all our problems, Mommy.

792
00:38:18,633 --> 00:38:20,669
Blood money from the St. Clairs.

793
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:23,642
And this time, you have my
blessing to deposit it in a bank,

794
00:38:23,645 --> 00:38:25,484
not in the fireplace.

795
00:38:27,016 --> 00:38:28,148
Aren't you glad?

796
00:38:28,151 --> 00:38:30,589
Your days of being a courtesan are over.

797
00:38:31,826 --> 00:38:33,059
Mommy?

798
00:38:33,062 --> 00:38:34,493
I said

799
00:38:34,495 --> 00:38:36,062
you can stop.

800
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:38,631
Oh, but, Cheryl...

801
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,835
Now, why would I stop

802
00:38:44,038 --> 00:38:46,338
when I'm having such a good time?

803
00:38:53,681 --> 00:38:56,649
I know there's a lot
to discuss and sort out.

804
00:38:57,852 --> 00:39:00,186
But for now, try to get some rest, okay?

805
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,313
Good night, Alice.

806
00:39:09,438 --> 00:39:11,063
Good night, Hal.

807
00:39:11,833 --> 00:39:13,216
Good night, Chic.

808
00:39:13,219 --> 00:39:14,767
You'll be safe here.

809
00:39:36,157 --> 00:39:38,044
Why didn't you say anything

810
00:39:38,047 --> 00:39:40,658
about what happened with you and Nick?

811
00:39:40,661 --> 00:39:42,394
I felt foolish,

812
00:39:44,265 --> 00:39:46,532
for not seeing him
for what he really was.

813
00:39:48,836 --> 00:39:50,870
Did you tell anyone else besides Cheryl?

814
00:39:54,823 --> 00:39:56,590
Kevin, but that's it.

815
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:10,589
Last time I asked for
protection for my father.

816
00:40:10,591 --> 00:40:12,024
I want it for Veronica, too.

817
00:40:12,027 --> 00:40:13,592
She's caught up in this.

818
00:40:13,594 --> 00:40:15,227
I don't want her hurt or in trouble.

819
00:40:15,229 --> 00:40:16,328
Help us,

820
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,797
and she, and your father,
are both off-limits.

821
00:40:18,799 --> 00:40:19,698
Protected.

822
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,966
I want that in writing.

823
00:40:20,969 --> 00:40:21,968
Absolutely.

824
00:40:21,971 --> 00:40:23,750
But you can't get emotional again.

825
00:40:23,753 --> 00:40:25,263
Not like you did with Nick St. Clair.

826
00:40:25,266 --> 00:40:27,166
You get emotional, you get sloppy.

827
00:40:27,169 --> 00:40:28,369
There's one more thing.

828
00:40:29,533 --> 00:40:31,410
If you've been following
me around for a while,

829
00:40:31,412 --> 00:40:33,078
you must know about the Black Hood.

830
00:40:33,081 --> 00:40:34,380
I do.

831
00:40:34,383 --> 00:40:35,450
Nice job.

832
00:40:35,453 --> 00:40:37,854
In your expert opinion, Agent Adams,

833
00:40:38,953 --> 00:40:41,020
do you think we got the right guy?

834
00:40:42,957 --> 00:40:44,990
I haven't told anyone about this,

835
00:40:46,627 --> 00:40:48,294
but I'm not so sure we did.

836
00:40:49,805 --> 00:40:51,363
And so, Archie,

837
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:54,154
always trying to do
the good, noble thing,

838
00:40:54,157 --> 00:40:56,835
took another step further into darkness.

839
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,117
And Betty,

840
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,686
the girl next door,

841
00:41:09,689 --> 00:41:12,418
had no sooner vanquished one monster...

842
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:30,149
than she'd perhaps let another
one into her family's lives.

843
