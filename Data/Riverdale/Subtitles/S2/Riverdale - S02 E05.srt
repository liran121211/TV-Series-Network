1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,519
Previously on Riverdale...

2
00:00:01,521 --> 00:00:04,155
You wanna get through this, you
should hang with the serpents.

3
00:00:04,157 --> 00:00:06,190
You really think you
can come to my house

4
00:00:06,192 --> 00:00:07,476
and there won't be any pay back?

5
00:00:07,479 --> 00:00:09,376
I'm wondering when you're actually gonna

6
00:00:09,379 --> 00:00:11,557
address the real problem in Riverdale,

7
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,997
the Southside.

8
00:00:12,999 --> 00:00:14,236
We need to be united.

9
00:00:14,239 --> 00:00:16,434
If we let the fear take
over, that's when we're dead.

10
00:00:16,436 --> 00:00:18,769
I want a more active
role in Lodge industries.

11
00:00:18,771 --> 00:00:20,571
Of course, you're a Lodge after all.

12
00:00:20,573 --> 00:00:22,373
Everybody needs to leave right now!

13
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:24,102
The Black Hood's coming here.

14
00:00:24,104 --> 00:00:27,445
This is from The Black Hood.
He says he's doing it for me.

15
00:00:28,481 --> 00:00:30,127
- Hello.
- Hello, Betty.

16
00:00:31,251 --> 00:00:33,084
This is the Black Hood speaking.

17
00:00:33,087 --> 00:00:34,620
How...

18
00:00:36,388 --> 00:00:38,355
How do I know this is real?

19
00:00:38,358 --> 00:00:41,226
"I will strike next where it all began."

20
00:00:41,229 --> 00:00:42,693
Were you there?

21
00:00:42,696 --> 00:00:44,428
At the Town Hall?

22
00:00:44,431 --> 00:00:45,696
Oh, yes.

23
00:00:45,699 --> 00:00:47,479
But you didn't hurt anyone?

24
00:00:47,482 --> 00:00:49,934
Tonight was all about you.

25
00:00:49,937 --> 00:00:51,936
What do you want?

26
00:00:51,939 --> 00:00:56,240
The same as you: to set Riverdale
on the righteous path again.

27
00:00:56,243 --> 00:00:58,276
To cleanse it of sinners...

28
00:00:58,279 --> 00:01:00,378
Isn't that what you want?

29
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,079
Not by killing people.

30
00:01:02,082 --> 00:01:04,081
Only the ones who deserve it.

31
00:01:04,084 --> 00:01:06,417
People like... your sister.

32
00:01:08,087 --> 00:01:10,755
I know all about the sin
she carries in her womb.

33
00:01:10,758 --> 00:01:14,892
I also know she's at a
farm, two hours North.

34
00:01:14,895 --> 00:01:17,929
If you try to warn her, I'll know.

35
00:01:17,931 --> 00:01:20,264
If you tell the police we've spoken

36
00:01:20,267 --> 00:01:22,667
or your mystery-loving boyfriend

37
00:01:22,669 --> 00:01:24,936
I'll carve her like a Jack O'Lantern.

38
00:01:24,938 --> 00:01:26,871
Please, don't hurt her.

39
00:01:26,874 --> 00:01:29,040
Who are you talking to? It's late.

40
00:01:29,042 --> 00:01:31,008
Then don't you deny me, Betty.

41
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:32,343
It was Jughead, wasn't it?

42
00:01:33,313 --> 00:01:34,478
Yeah.

43
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,514
You know, I gave him
the benefit of the doubt,

44
00:01:36,516 --> 00:01:38,416
but now that he's
living on the Southside

45
00:01:38,418 --> 00:01:40,363
amongst those criminals and degenerates,

46
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:41,788
he's showing his true colors.

47
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:44,822
No doubt, inspiring that
stunt of yours at Town Hall.

48
00:01:44,824 --> 00:01:46,182
Pulling the fire alarm?

49
00:01:46,185 --> 00:01:48,218
I didn't know what else to do.

50
00:01:48,221 --> 00:01:50,755
Given the letter that
the Black Hood sent me.

51
00:01:50,758 --> 00:01:52,396
If he even wrote it.

52
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,899
Sheriff Keller said something seems off.

53
00:01:54,902 --> 00:01:57,301
He's gonna have it analyzed,
along with the one that I got.

54
00:01:57,303 --> 00:02:00,671
In the meantime, I want you
home straight after school

55
00:02:00,674 --> 00:02:03,641
- Are we clear?
- Yeah. Sorry, Mom.

56
00:02:05,278 --> 00:02:08,040
I did what Weatherbee asked.
Wrote an apology letter,

57
00:02:08,043 --> 00:02:10,748
and posted a new video,
apologizing some more.

58
00:02:10,751 --> 00:02:15,386
So this Red Circle business, it's over,

59
00:02:16,348 --> 00:02:18,081
I'm happy to hear it.

60
00:02:21,194 --> 00:02:22,827
I'm missing my son.

61
00:02:31,121 --> 00:02:33,236
_

62
00:02:34,374 --> 00:02:36,073
I need to tell you something, Arch,

63
00:02:36,075 --> 00:02:38,032
but you can't tell anyone else.

64
00:02:38,035 --> 00:02:40,277
Not Veronica, not Jughead not your dad,

65
00:02:40,279 --> 00:02:41,912
no one. Promise me.

66
00:02:41,914 --> 00:02:43,781
Yeah, sure. I promise.

67
00:02:43,783 --> 00:02:45,683
The Black Hood called me.

68
00:02:47,854 --> 00:02:49,553
- What?
- Keep walking.

69
00:02:50,723 --> 00:02:52,860
Wait, the Black Hood called you?

70
00:02:52,863 --> 00:02:55,761
Yes. It's risky for me
to even be telling you.

71
00:02:55,764 --> 00:02:58,062
But we're best friends and we
live right next door to each other

72
00:02:58,064 --> 00:02:59,630
So us walking to school together,

73
00:02:59,632 --> 00:03:02,266
would look perfectly normal to
anyone who might be watching.

74
00:03:02,268 --> 00:03:03,668
Including him.

75
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:05,102
You think he's watching us?

76
00:03:05,104 --> 00:03:06,404
I don't know, he could be.

77
00:03:06,406 --> 00:03:08,793
I know it sounds crazy, but it was him.

78
00:03:08,796 --> 00:03:10,608
Betty, you have to tell the
police. Even if it's not him.

79
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,535
It is him.

80
00:03:11,538 --> 00:03:14,477
And he told me if I went to the
police, or if I told Jughead, he'd...

81
00:03:15,682 --> 00:03:17,748
God, he knows where Polly is, Arch.

82
00:03:17,751 --> 00:03:19,884
If he calls me again, I have to answer.

83
00:03:19,886 --> 00:03:21,526
I'm not letting you
go through this alone.

84
00:03:25,091 --> 00:03:28,492
"This most recent incident
confirms that the real threat

85
00:03:28,494 --> 00:03:32,630
is not the Black Hood, but the
Southside and its corruptive forces.

86
00:03:32,633 --> 00:03:35,933
Developer and ex-con Hiram Lodge

87
00:03:35,935 --> 00:03:39,644
boasts that his SoDale project will
revitalize the forsaken neighborhood,

88
00:03:39,647 --> 00:03:41,172
But this reporter speculates

89
00:03:41,174 --> 00:03:43,674
Hiram Lodge doesn't
want to fix our problems,

90
00:03:43,676 --> 00:03:44,975
merely profit from them."

91
00:03:44,978 --> 00:03:48,352
And right before our Open
House. Thank you, Alice Cooper.

92
00:03:49,816 --> 00:03:51,916
We can't let anything
derail the project.

93
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:54,652
Not Alice, not the Southside gangs,

94
00:03:54,654 --> 00:03:55,920
not some hooded psychopath.

95
00:03:55,922 --> 00:03:58,723
Okay, but right now, our
biggest problem is capital.

96
00:03:58,725 --> 00:04:00,491
We're running out of it and fast.

97
00:04:00,493 --> 00:04:03,060
I've invited potential
investors to the Open House.

98
00:04:03,062 --> 00:04:04,829
The St. Clairs are
coming up from New York.

99
00:04:04,832 --> 00:04:07,198
Wait. They are?

100
00:04:07,201 --> 00:04:10,980
Nicky included? I haven't
seen Nicky in forever!

101
00:04:13,473 --> 00:04:16,719
Yeah. He's a budding
music producer, now.

102
00:04:16,722 --> 00:04:19,443
And his father is King Midas rich.

103
00:04:19,445 --> 00:04:22,012
We get him to invest,
others will follow.

104
00:04:22,014 --> 00:04:23,814
You wanted a seat at the table?

105
00:04:23,817 --> 00:04:26,317
Nick has his father's ear.

106
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,119
Help us close this.

107
00:04:28,121 --> 00:04:30,821
Show him all the good things
Riverdale has to offer.

108
00:04:31,758 --> 00:04:33,190
With pleasure.

109
00:04:38,965 --> 00:04:40,898
Nice article your
girlfriend's Mom wrote.

110
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,466
Yeah, I saw that.

111
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:45,236
Dilton Doiley said he was stabbed
when a bunch of you guys jumped him.

112
00:04:45,238 --> 00:04:47,938
Idiot stabbed himself.
With his own knife.

113
00:04:47,941 --> 00:04:50,074
And we didn't jump
him, there was a fight,

114
00:04:50,076 --> 00:04:52,309
Bulldogs versus Serpents,
and you see this?

115
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,507
Your boy Andrews gave it to me.

116
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,714
Just before his girlfriend
shot a gun into the air.

117
00:04:56,717 --> 00:04:58,002
What happened?

118
00:04:58,005 --> 00:05:01,006
And of course, Northsiders
get off scot-free,

119
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,293
and the rest of us are
hauled in by the police.

120
00:05:03,296 --> 00:05:05,121
It's payback time.

121
00:05:05,124 --> 00:05:06,590
What are you guys talking about?

122
00:05:07,627 --> 00:05:08,793
This.

123
00:05:08,796 --> 00:05:10,394
What is that?

124
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,391
Is that a pipebomb?

125
00:05:13,394 --> 00:05:15,933
Fogarty's cousin served in the Army.

126
00:05:15,935 --> 00:05:17,401
He's gonna build us something.

127
00:05:17,403 --> 00:05:19,136
We'll do it after hours,

128
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:21,839
but it'll shut the Riverdale
register down once and for all.

129
00:05:21,841 --> 00:05:24,475
You think blowing up a building
is going to make things better?

130
00:05:24,477 --> 00:05:25,776
Can't get any worse

131
00:05:25,778 --> 00:05:28,078
Yeah, Sweet Pea, it can.

132
00:05:28,081 --> 00:05:31,048
Let me talk to Archie. Let
me figure this out. Okay?

133
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,783
Man, that's your answer for everything.

134
00:05:32,785 --> 00:05:36,353
Talk and more talk. And we don't
even know who you stand with.

135
00:05:36,356 --> 00:05:39,024
Us? Or them?

136
00:05:43,328 --> 00:05:45,061
You can't be half a Serpent.

137
00:05:53,406 --> 00:05:56,640
Great. So Archie started World War III.

138
00:05:56,643 --> 00:05:59,742
Northside has been
dumping on us for years.

139
00:05:59,745 --> 00:06:04,014
Your dad tried to keep
the peace, avoid bloodshed.

140
00:06:04,016 --> 00:06:06,050
Now that he's gone,
idiots like Sweet Pea

141
00:06:06,052 --> 00:06:08,779
think there's only one
path and one solution.

142
00:06:08,782 --> 00:06:10,888
Violence.

143
00:06:14,994 --> 00:06:18,716
Nick and I were the "will they
or won't they?" of our jet set

144
00:06:18,719 --> 00:06:21,398
He's an outrageous
flirt, but we never dated.

145
00:06:21,401 --> 00:06:25,069
We'd hop from club to club,
go on these madcap adventures,

146
00:06:25,071 --> 00:06:26,937
- stay up all night...
- Who's this now?

147
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:29,306
Oh, Archiekins, don't be jelly,

148
00:06:29,308 --> 00:06:32,376
it's just a ghost from my
bad girl past, Nick St. Clair,

149
00:06:32,378 --> 00:06:33,944
breezing into town for the Open House.

150
00:06:33,946 --> 00:06:35,946
You have nothing to worry about.

151
00:06:49,603 --> 00:06:51,669
I thin this Northsider's lost.

152
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:53,811
I'm not.

153
00:06:55,735 --> 00:06:57,401
I'm over being half a Serpent.

154
00:06:57,404 --> 00:07:02,006
Wow. You will do anything to
protect your Northside buddies.

155
00:07:04,093 --> 00:07:07,528
My father was a Serpent. He led you.

156
00:07:09,148 --> 00:07:10,748
I wanna stand with you guys.

157
00:07:14,387 --> 00:07:16,887
Tall Boy was the one
who gave me this jacket.

158
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:19,490
It's finally time I start wearing it.

159
00:07:22,261 --> 00:07:25,763
So, now you wanna be a Serpent, huh?

160
00:07:27,967 --> 00:07:30,701
Let's see if you survive
the initiation first.

161
00:07:43,946 --> 00:07:45,178
"Unknown."

162
00:07:50,448 --> 00:07:51,481
Hello?

163
00:07:51,484 --> 00:07:53,050
Your mother's at work.

164
00:07:54,093 --> 00:07:55,608
Yes, she and my dad are...

165
00:07:55,611 --> 00:07:58,896
I know, I'm looking at them
through a nice, big picture window.

166
00:07:58,899 --> 00:08:00,365
Are you alone?

167
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:03,679
I am.

168
00:08:03,682 --> 00:08:06,337
She's a thorn in both of
our sides, your mother.

169
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,440
We can't have her looming over us.

170
00:08:09,442 --> 00:08:11,224
Wait. If you're suggesting...

171
00:08:11,227 --> 00:08:12,627
Check your email.

172
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:16,246
Publish what I've sent. And
then I'll know that you're loyal.

173
00:08:19,881 --> 00:08:23,483
I want something in return.
To prove your loyalty.

174
00:08:23,486 --> 00:08:25,119
How about...

175
00:08:26,546 --> 00:08:30,127
You do this for me. And then
you get to ask me a question.

176
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,196
And I have to answer it.

177
00:08:32,199 --> 00:08:34,098
You have until tomorrow night.

178
00:08:46,278 --> 00:08:48,445
Oh, my God. Is that...

179
00:08:48,448 --> 00:08:50,447
It's my mom.

180
00:08:52,249 --> 00:08:55,632

181
00:09:03,188 --> 00:09:04,254
What the hell?

182
00:09:04,256 --> 00:09:06,856
Your initiation begins now.

183
00:09:06,859 --> 00:09:09,959
With you assuming the
guardianship of the beast.

184
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,763
You've gotta be kidding me.

185
00:09:13,765 --> 00:09:15,518
So, what do you think of the beast?

186
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:18,365
He stinks and he barks all the time.

187
00:09:18,368 --> 00:09:19,783
He's got no boundaries.

188
00:09:19,786 --> 00:09:22,291
Every new recruit has to take
care of Hot Dog. It's tradition.

189
00:09:22,294 --> 00:09:24,508
By the way, this is our third Hot Dog.

190
00:09:24,511 --> 00:09:27,271
Oh, Hot Dog the third?

191
00:09:27,274 --> 00:09:28,945
This is getting borderline ridiculous.

192
00:09:28,947 --> 00:09:31,681
Kind of like Forsyth the third?

193
00:09:36,183 --> 00:09:37,868
My mom went after the Black Hood hard,

194
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:40,319
so it's no surprise he
wants to humiliate her.

195
00:09:40,322 --> 00:09:42,968
We can't do it, Arch. It
would destroy her credibility.

196
00:09:42,971 --> 00:09:45,539
Yeah. And build yours
with the Black Hood.

197
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:49,679
Anyway, what credibility? Your
mom's always going after our friends.

198
00:09:49,682 --> 00:09:53,079
It would blindside her.
We can't publish it.

199
00:09:56,775 --> 00:09:59,476
Mr. and Mrs. St. Clair.

200
00:09:59,479 --> 00:10:02,651
Nicholas. On behalf of
my mother and father,

201
00:10:02,654 --> 00:10:04,220
welcome to Riverdale.

202
00:10:04,223 --> 00:10:07,484
While you're in town, think of
me as your "corporate concierge."

203
00:10:07,486 --> 00:10:09,152
Anything you need, ask away.

204
00:10:09,155 --> 00:10:11,788
How about a better hotel, to start?

205
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,456
Now, now, Nicholas.

206
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:16,626
It's not the Waldorf,
nor the Plaza, but,

207
00:10:16,628 --> 00:10:19,929
The Five Seasons, like all of
Riverdale, it has its charms.

208
00:10:19,932 --> 00:10:23,627
One charm. Veronica Lodge,

209
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,735
as lovely as ever.

210
00:10:28,574 --> 00:10:31,107
We sent the letters to
two different specialists

211
00:10:31,109 --> 00:10:32,809
but the handwriting wasn't a match.

212
00:10:32,811 --> 00:10:36,312
So whoever wrote your letter was
either a copycat, or pranking you, or...

213
00:10:36,314 --> 00:10:38,181
Or something much more banal

214
00:10:38,183 --> 00:10:40,450
like a teenager acting
out to get attention.

215
00:10:40,452 --> 00:10:41,914
What? You think I wrote it?

216
00:10:41,917 --> 00:10:44,604
The cipher was cribbed
from a Nancy Drew book

217
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,873
of all places.

218
00:10:45,884 --> 00:10:49,225
Mom, what possible reason
could I have for making this up?

219
00:10:49,227 --> 00:10:51,594
I don't know, Betty. Maybe
you and your Serpent boyfriend

220
00:10:51,596 --> 00:10:53,830
cooked this up because
you guys were bored.

221
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:56,674
Okay. We're not gonna
rule anything out yet,

222
00:10:56,677 --> 00:10:58,597
at least not till we know
who we're dealing with.

223
00:11:09,518 --> 00:11:11,385
_

224
00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:18,570
"A serpent never shows cowardice."

225
00:11:18,573 --> 00:11:22,463
"If a Serpent's killed or imprisoned,
their family will be taken care of."

226
00:11:22,466 --> 00:11:24,523
Serpents...

227
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:29,198
Come on, focus. You need
to take this seriously.

228
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,502
Okay, I am, Toni, I
swear to God I am, just...

229
00:11:32,505 --> 00:11:35,477
First the Beast, and now these laws.

230
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,080
Why the change of heart, anyway?

231
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:40,285
Why go from conscientious
objector to full-fledged member?

232
00:11:40,288 --> 00:11:42,255
'Cause of something you said...

233
00:11:44,883 --> 00:11:48,284
My dad was the only person that was
keeping idiots like Sweet Pea in line.

234
00:11:48,286 --> 00:11:50,653
Someone needs to step up.

235
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:54,123
To keep an all-out war from erupting.

236
00:11:56,641 --> 00:11:58,841
I am taking this seriously, Toni.

237
00:11:59,702 --> 00:12:01,264
So from the top.

238
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:04,100
What is the fourth law?

239
00:12:04,102 --> 00:12:07,070
"No serpent is left for dead."

240
00:12:07,072 --> 00:12:09,372
What is the fifth law?

241
00:12:09,374 --> 00:12:12,041
"A serpent never betrays its own."

242
00:12:12,043 --> 00:12:13,643
What is the sixth?

243
00:12:13,645 --> 00:12:16,212
"In unity, there is strength."

244
00:12:16,214 --> 00:12:18,915
In unity, there is strength!

245
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,643
You know the laws.

246
00:12:25,646 --> 00:12:28,758
Now it's time for the next trial.

247
00:12:34,757 --> 00:12:37,591
Retrieve the knife.

248
00:12:38,463 --> 00:12:39,862
What?

249
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,274
Rattlesnake, Toni.

250
00:12:45,276 --> 00:12:47,243
The rattle snake bit me and drew blood.

251
00:12:47,245 --> 00:12:49,612
One that had its venom glands removed.

252
00:12:49,614 --> 00:12:52,015
The important thing
is you showed no fear.

253
00:12:52,017 --> 00:12:54,784
You grabbed the knife and
you remembered all the laws.

254
00:12:54,786 --> 00:12:57,186
Which means you're almost
a Serpant now, Juggie.

255
00:13:06,665 --> 00:13:09,098
My regular, Pop. Thanks.

256
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,768
I don't judge you,
Alice. It was years ago.

257
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:13,603
What the hell are you talking about?

258
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,637
Who gave you this article?

259
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,751
Because I know I ripped it
out of every public archive.

260
00:13:28,753 --> 00:13:30,820
Maybe it was one of the
thousands of Southsiders

261
00:13:30,822 --> 00:13:33,156
you attack in your paper daily.

262
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:37,038
I mean, really, Mom, you talk
trash about FP, about Jughead,

263
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,462
about the Serpents when
you yourself were one.

264
00:13:39,464 --> 00:13:41,230
Why would you publish that?

265
00:13:43,301 --> 00:13:46,335
Revenge, plain and simple.

266
00:13:47,505 --> 00:13:49,639
No, Mom. Not revenge.

267
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:52,475
Justice.

268
00:13:52,478 --> 00:13:56,476
Against you and your
holier-than-thou attitude.

269
00:13:56,479 --> 00:13:58,212
Betty, that is enough.

270
00:14:02,721 --> 00:14:05,722
I'm so glad you two are
getting this chance to meet.

271
00:14:05,724 --> 00:14:08,791
Although, your brown-nosing
at dinner was over the top.

272
00:14:08,793 --> 00:14:12,428
How dare you? I love your mother's flan.

273
00:14:15,233 --> 00:14:19,402
Although, I still have
room for more dessert.

274
00:14:21,729 --> 00:14:22,995
Here.

275
00:14:26,406 --> 00:14:28,673
No, thank you. I'm full.

276
00:14:28,676 --> 00:14:31,414
Veronica Lodge turning down a bump.

277
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:33,516
What a brave new world it is.

278
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:36,486
How about it, Big Red?

279
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:46,129
So, what is it that you
country mice do for fun up here?

280
00:14:46,132 --> 00:14:48,531
Catch lightning bugs in mason jars?

281
00:14:48,533 --> 00:14:50,099
- No, we...
- Basically.

282
00:14:52,036 --> 00:14:53,684
Ronnie,

283
00:14:53,687 --> 00:14:56,172
what kind of kink is this?

284
00:14:56,174 --> 00:14:59,275
I wear them when I'm plm ing
with Josie and the Pussycats.

285
00:15:00,245 --> 00:15:02,011
- You're in a band?
- Mmm-hmm.

286
00:15:02,013 --> 00:15:04,046
Called the Pussycats?

287
00:15:04,049 --> 00:15:07,590
Just when I thought you
couldn't possibly get any sexier.

288
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:26,936
Hello?

289
00:15:26,938 --> 00:15:28,538
How did it feel, Betty?

290
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:31,634
Knocking your mother of her high horse?

291
00:15:31,637 --> 00:15:33,776
We had a deal.

292
00:15:34,846 --> 00:15:36,412
What's your question?

293
00:15:38,316 --> 00:15:39,982
And it can't be my name.

294
00:15:44,175 --> 00:15:46,643
The face under the hood...

295
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,205
Would I recognize it?

296
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:53,696
Yes.

297
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:58,996
Do you feel closer to me now?

298
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:02,238
I do. I feel as if we're friends.

299
00:16:02,241 --> 00:16:05,741
But I'm selfish, Betty. I don't
like sharing you with other people.

300
00:16:05,743 --> 00:16:08,744
So I need you to cut
them out of your life,

301
00:16:08,746 --> 00:16:10,746
or I will, my way.

302
00:16:12,016 --> 00:16:14,817
Let's start with that
daughter of a philanderer,

303
00:16:14,819 --> 00:16:18,343
and an embezzler, complicit
in her father's crimes...

304
00:16:18,346 --> 00:16:19,713
Veronica's not...

305
00:16:20,921 --> 00:16:22,158
She's innocent.

306
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,292
Oh, Betty,

307
00:16:23,294 --> 00:16:25,261
you don't really believe that.

308
00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:41,189
Betty Cooper.

309
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,294
You are a sight for sore eyes.

310
00:16:47,264 --> 00:16:49,197
Thanks for coming to meet me.

311
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:01,643
God, I've missed you, I just...

312
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:05,045
I'm feeling... I don't know...

313
00:17:05,048 --> 00:17:06,147
Unmoored.

314
00:17:06,149 --> 00:17:07,682
Me, too.

315
00:17:09,752 --> 00:17:11,785
I just wanted to make
sure you were still alive.

316
00:17:11,788 --> 00:17:13,121
What do you mean?

317
00:17:14,357 --> 00:17:18,459
That expose that you published
about your mom, that article.

318
00:17:18,461 --> 00:17:20,195
Oh, um...

319
00:17:20,198 --> 00:17:23,097
That's a long story,
but yeah, pretty intense.

320
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:24,799
What happened to your hand?

321
00:17:26,303 --> 00:17:27,802
I'm dogsitting.

322
00:17:27,804 --> 00:17:30,605
You remember Hot Dog, that mutt?

323
00:17:30,607 --> 00:17:32,538
Don't worry, he's got the shots.

324
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,075
I wish we could just go.

325
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:50,792
Just hop on the motorcycle
and just leave Riverdale.

326
00:17:50,795 --> 00:17:54,562
Go someplace where there's
no Northside, or Southside,

327
00:17:54,565 --> 00:17:57,365
or Serpents, Ghoulies...

328
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,801
No...

329
00:17:58,804 --> 00:18:02,003
Crazy moms, no Black Hoods.

330
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:11,579
Like Romeo and Juliet, but we
live happily ever after instead.

331
00:18:22,092 --> 00:18:25,824
You Pussycats are pearls
before the swine of Riverdale.

332
00:18:25,827 --> 00:18:28,396
You all have to come to the
party I'm hosting tonight

333
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:29,468
in your honor.

334
00:18:29,471 --> 00:18:32,900
Let's say ten o'clock, my
hotel room at the Five Seasons.

335
00:18:32,902 --> 00:18:35,670
Did somebody say party?

336
00:18:37,841 --> 00:18:39,274
Hi, there.

337
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:42,148
I'm Riverdale's Resident
It Girl, Cheryl Blossom.

338
00:18:43,312 --> 00:18:45,490
You must be Veronica's old
school chum I keep hearing about

339
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:47,282
Nick St. Clair.

340
00:18:47,285 --> 00:18:49,851
Now that's a name I can get behind.

341
00:18:50,553 --> 00:18:51,986
Ten o'clock, you said?

342
00:18:51,989 --> 00:18:53,843
I'll be there at 11:00.

343
00:19:01,498 --> 00:19:02,764
Betty.

344
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,065
What's up?

345
00:19:04,067 --> 00:19:06,796
I uh... I went by your
house this morning,

346
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,196
to walk you to school, but your
mom said you'd already left.

347
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,706
Did he call you again?

348
00:19:14,544 --> 00:19:15,984
No, he didn't.

349
00:19:15,987 --> 00:19:17,211
Betty...

350
00:19:17,984 --> 00:19:20,882
My old friend Nick here
is having a little soiree

351
00:19:20,884 --> 00:19:22,817
at his hotel tonight. Will you come?

352
00:19:22,819 --> 00:19:25,186
Betty's my bestie and the best.

353
00:19:25,189 --> 00:19:27,089
I won't take no for an answer.

354
00:19:28,664 --> 00:19:30,030
I wouldn't miss it.

355
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,697
And then, we walk into the Gilded Lily,

356
00:19:35,699 --> 00:19:37,332
and there's Gal! Again!

357
00:19:37,334 --> 00:19:39,113
"Gal"?

358
00:19:39,116 --> 00:19:40,956
Gadot. Keep up, Archie.

359
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:43,671
Archiekins. A refill, s'il vous plait?

360
00:19:43,673 --> 00:19:44,939
Forget the teetotaling.

361
00:19:44,941 --> 00:19:46,987
Let's move on to something
with a little more kick.

362
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:49,844
- Is that...
- Jinglejangle? Why, yes. It is.

363
00:19:49,846 --> 00:19:52,580
- I hooked him up.
- Tasters? Who's up first?

364
00:19:52,582 --> 00:19:53,881
Dude, we told you, we're not...

365
00:19:53,883 --> 00:19:55,616
Archie, don't take this the wrong way,

366
00:19:55,618 --> 00:19:57,618
but you are an epic buzzkill.

367
00:20:00,156 --> 00:20:01,255
Come on, Vee.

368
00:20:01,257 --> 00:20:02,690
Like back in the day.

369
00:20:02,692 --> 00:20:05,693
Aren't you supposed to
be showing me a good time?

370
00:20:05,695 --> 00:20:06,928
Per Daddy's orders?

371
00:20:09,366 --> 00:20:12,427
Down, Nicky, I'm just getting going.

372
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:15,069
And now that you mention it,

373
00:20:15,071 --> 00:20:18,172
I, in fact, wouldn't mind a little
sugar to spice up this party.

374
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,642
What?

375
00:20:21,644 --> 00:20:24,178
Every other night it's
burgers and milkshakes.

376
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:27,749
Can't we just cut loose and
pretend we're normal, for once?

377
00:20:27,752 --> 00:20:29,550
- I'm in.
- Me, too.

378
00:20:29,553 --> 00:20:30,885
Kevin?

379
00:20:32,422 --> 00:20:34,956
Pussycats, care to partake?

380
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:37,625
- Betty?
- No, thanks.

381
00:20:37,627 --> 00:20:39,994
- Come on, it'll be fun.
- I said no, Vee.

382
00:20:39,996 --> 00:20:43,097
Okay, relax, Betty, this
is strictly voluntary.

383
00:20:43,099 --> 00:20:45,032
Perhaps we should decamp to the bedroom,

384
00:20:45,034 --> 00:20:47,168
so as not to corrupt the country mice.

385
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:49,370
You know what? I
changed my mind. I'm in.

386
00:20:49,372 --> 00:20:51,172
Bravo, Archie Andrews!

387
00:20:51,174 --> 00:20:54,642
There's that good, strong Riverdale
stock I've been jonesing for!

388
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:28,476
Come on, Betty, don't
be such a wallflower!

389
00:21:28,478 --> 00:21:30,778
You're boyfriendless for
a night! Have some fun!

390
00:21:30,781 --> 00:21:32,909
Like you, you mean?

391
00:21:32,912 --> 00:21:35,983
I was gonna say you're
making a fool of yourself.

392
00:21:35,986 --> 00:21:40,955
Acting like some privileged,
shallow, airhead party girl.

393
00:21:40,957 --> 00:21:42,623
Excuse me?

394
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:43,991
Yeah.

395
00:21:44,894 --> 00:21:47,666
I mean, it's all recycled banter

396
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:51,032
and plunging necklines and
throwing shade to distract us

397
00:21:51,034 --> 00:21:54,248
all from the fact that there's
really nothing going on underneath...

398
00:21:54,251 --> 00:21:57,104
- Betty, what the hell are you saying?
- What we're all thinking.

399
00:21:57,107 --> 00:22:01,409
That the only reason Veronica
hangs out with us is circumstance.

400
00:22:01,411 --> 00:22:02,743
She's not our friend.

401
00:22:02,745 --> 00:22:05,737
The minute someone from
her trashy past shows up,

402
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:09,884
she starts using us for
drugs or music or distraction,

403
00:22:09,886 --> 00:22:11,819
and why should we be surprised?

404
00:22:11,822 --> 00:22:14,055
Like father, like daughter, right?

405
00:22:14,058 --> 00:22:15,556
You better shut it down, Betty.

406
00:22:15,558 --> 00:22:17,534
Or what, Veronica?

407
00:22:17,537 --> 00:22:19,627
You'll have your dad put a hit on me?

408
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,462
Or maybe you'll do it yourself,

409
00:22:21,464 --> 00:22:24,499
because you may have fooled
all of them, but not me.

410
00:22:24,501 --> 00:22:29,370
Try to reform all you want, but
you're a bad person, Veronica.

411
00:22:29,372 --> 00:22:31,339
You'll always be a bad person.

412
00:22:33,743 --> 00:22:36,377
Why don't you just go,
then, if I'm such a monster?

413
00:22:47,223 --> 00:22:48,990
- Veronica...
- I'm fine.

414
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:50,858
Obviously, she's not.

415
00:22:51,728 --> 00:22:53,561
What? You wanna go
after her, be my guest.

416
00:22:53,563 --> 00:22:56,030
But I'll be damned if I'm
chasing Betty down after that...

417
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,165
Whatever it was.

418
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,400
In fact, Reggie?

419
00:22:59,912 --> 00:23:01,802
Turn the music up, will you?

420
00:23:03,606 --> 00:23:05,106
What's up?

421
00:23:05,975 --> 00:23:07,608
Jughead, I, um...

422
00:23:08,411 --> 00:23:10,478
I came to warn you, I guess.

423
00:23:11,814 --> 00:23:14,115
If you're having second thoughts,

424
00:23:14,118 --> 00:23:16,317
now would be the time to back out

425
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,286
because the final trial,

426
00:23:19,289 --> 00:23:20,988
is on a whole other level.

427
00:23:20,991 --> 00:23:22,924
"The Gauntlet", you mean?

428
00:23:23,818 --> 00:23:26,401
If it's anything like the
Beast, I think I'll be fine.

429
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:27,828
It's whatever.

430
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,964
No, Jughead, it's not "whatever."

431
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:34,502
You join us, you gotta
be willing to die for us.

432
00:23:36,439 --> 00:23:38,272
Because we will for you.

433
00:23:38,274 --> 00:23:41,809
And your Northside
friends? Your girlfriend?

434
00:23:42,497 --> 00:23:45,451
You're gonna look up one day,
and they're all gonna be gone,

435
00:23:45,454 --> 00:23:48,583
because that's what happens
when you join a gang.

436
00:23:48,585 --> 00:23:50,551
The Serpents are no exception.

437
00:23:51,588 --> 00:23:54,855
Consider me warned, thank you, Toni.

438
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:04,665
Never has one of my parties
fizzled out so spectacularly.

439
00:24:04,667 --> 00:24:07,368
I don't know what got into Betty.

440
00:24:07,371 --> 00:24:10,503
She's my best friend, believe it or not.

441
00:24:10,506 --> 00:24:12,373
Those things that she said,

442
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:14,375
you're not a bad person, Veronica.

443
00:24:14,378 --> 00:24:17,445
In fact, you're incredible.

444
00:24:17,448 --> 00:24:21,029
You're smart, vivacious.

445
00:24:21,032 --> 00:24:22,783
You're sexy.

446
00:24:22,786 --> 00:24:27,254
Nick, I'm sorry if I gave
you the wrong impression.

447
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:30,224
- I'm with Archie.
- Oh, come on, Vee.

448
00:24:30,226 --> 00:24:33,194
You barely looked at that
hayseed yokel all night.

449
00:24:33,196 --> 00:24:34,306
You were all over me.

450
00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:36,631
Nick, we're friends, we're old friends.

451
00:24:36,633 --> 00:24:38,866
Nick, I mean it, stop!

452
00:24:41,404 --> 00:24:42,870
Same old Veronica, huh?

453
00:24:42,872 --> 00:24:46,273
You flirt and you tease, but in the end,

454
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:48,275
you think you're better than me.

455
00:24:48,277 --> 00:24:49,353
You're a pig.

456
00:24:49,356 --> 00:24:52,480
With the power to implode this
pathetic deal your criminal father's

457
00:24:52,482 --> 00:24:54,053
so desperately trying to make happen.

458
00:24:54,056 --> 00:24:55,939
So unless you want that to go away,

459
00:24:55,942 --> 00:24:59,144
I'd be thinking of ways you might
start showing me some appreciation.

460
00:24:59,147 --> 00:25:03,057
If you need help, I
can suggest a couple...

461
00:25:36,926 --> 00:25:38,259
I did it.

462
00:25:39,262 --> 00:25:41,662
But now I want my question,

463
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,667
- what will make you stop?
- You.

464
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,724
As long as you continue
showing me your devotion.

465
00:25:49,727 --> 00:25:51,972
I can't keep doing this...

466
00:25:51,975 --> 00:25:53,441
I'm sure you can.

467
00:25:53,444 --> 00:25:55,443
Jughead.

468
00:25:55,446 --> 00:25:57,344
- The son of a Serpent.
- No.

469
00:25:57,346 --> 00:25:59,547
He's not worthy of your love.

470
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:03,551
Cut him out of your life...

471
00:26:03,554 --> 00:26:05,686
Or I will.

472
00:26:16,415 --> 00:26:18,515
What the hell was that last night?

473
00:26:20,152 --> 00:26:22,085
- Betty...
- I lied to you.

474
00:26:24,756 --> 00:26:27,524
When you asked me if the Black
Hood had called again. He did.

475
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:34,864
And he told me to cut Veronica
out of my life or he'd...

476
00:26:36,101 --> 00:26:38,283
And now he wants me to do
the same with Jughead...

477
00:26:38,286 --> 00:26:39,669
Betty, why didn't you tell me?

478
00:26:39,671 --> 00:26:41,471
Because I knew you'd
try to talk me out of it.

479
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,640
You're right.

480
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:45,809
It's my mistake.

481
00:26:46,587 --> 00:26:49,079
Archie, put the phone
down! Put the phone down!

482
00:26:49,081 --> 00:26:50,513
Listen to me.

483
00:26:50,515 --> 00:26:54,939
He hasn't attacked or killed
anyone since we started talking.

484
00:26:54,942 --> 00:26:57,053
I think this is distracting him.

485
00:26:57,055 --> 00:26:58,655
Betty, he's torturing you.

486
00:26:58,657 --> 00:27:02,123
Making you hurt your mom,
Veronica and now Jughead?

487
00:27:02,126 --> 00:27:06,374
How are you gonna put him
and yourself through that?

488
00:27:11,736 --> 00:27:13,837
I was hoping maybe you would do it.

489
00:27:17,375 --> 00:27:18,675
What?

490
00:27:20,278 --> 00:27:23,468
Maybe you could tell
him that we just need

491
00:27:23,471 --> 00:27:27,056
to stay away from
each other for a while.

492
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:29,953
Something, anything,
to just keep him away...

493
00:27:29,955 --> 00:27:31,421
To appease the Black Hood.

494
00:27:31,423 --> 00:27:33,857
- Betty.
- It doesn't have to be cruel, Archie,

495
00:27:33,859 --> 00:27:36,259
just enough to make Jug believe it.

496
00:27:37,529 --> 00:27:38,928
We can walk it back later.

497
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:39,996
You mean, you hope we can.

498
00:27:39,998 --> 00:27:42,332
No. We can.

499
00:27:42,334 --> 00:27:43,533
And we will.

500
00:27:46,339 --> 00:27:47,938
Please, Archie.

501
00:27:49,455 --> 00:27:51,555
Don't quit on me now.

502
00:28:06,224 --> 00:28:08,525
Hey, so great to see you.

503
00:28:08,527 --> 00:28:10,760
- Thank you for coming.
- Glad to see you.

504
00:28:11,473 --> 00:28:14,863
Oh, well, if this turnout doesn't
convince the St. Clairs to invest,

505
00:28:14,866 --> 00:28:16,366
I don't know what will.

506
00:28:17,235 --> 00:28:19,802
Hey, mija. How'd it go with Nick?

507
00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:21,804
Why, did he say something?

508
00:28:21,806 --> 00:28:23,740
No, we haven't seen him.
But from all reports,

509
00:28:23,742 --> 00:28:27,043
your charm offensive is
paying off. Good work.

510
00:28:27,046 --> 00:28:28,711
Oh, there's Nick now.

511
00:28:28,714 --> 00:28:31,147
Oh, looks like we're
running low on canapes.

512
00:28:31,149 --> 00:28:33,917
Excuse me while I go
quietly yell at the caterer.

513
00:28:35,387 --> 00:28:37,587
And I have a partner to wrangle.

514
00:28:37,589 --> 00:28:39,022
Yeah.

515
00:28:42,694 --> 00:28:45,395
The whole point of this
Open House is to socialize.

516
00:28:45,397 --> 00:28:49,017
Figured I'd leave that to the pros.

517
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,568
You're not without your
charms, Fred Andrews.

518
00:28:53,338 --> 00:28:55,138
We're glad you're back at work.

519
00:28:55,141 --> 00:28:56,906
We, huh?

520
00:28:58,476 --> 00:29:01,311
Hiram Lodge. It's been
a long time, buddy.

521
00:29:01,313 --> 00:29:03,146
Yeah. Glad you could make it.

522
00:29:03,148 --> 00:29:05,415
- Hey, my pleasure.
- Where's Alice?

523
00:29:05,417 --> 00:29:09,797
Well, between us, that
mugshot took a toll on her.

524
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,134
So we both decided, it'd be better
if I covered the event alone.

525
00:29:13,137 --> 00:29:17,754
Well, we'd love to have you
standing with us up on that stage.

526
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,907
I mean, hell, you built it.

527
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,399
That's true.

528
00:29:24,569 --> 00:29:27,103
Oh, my God!

529
00:29:47,826 --> 00:29:49,459
- Alice.
- Shove it, Hal.

530
00:29:50,795 --> 00:29:53,463
You're gonna need to
top this off, thank you.

531
00:29:54,298 --> 00:29:56,732
Before you throw a drink in my face,

532
00:29:56,735 --> 00:29:58,234
I'm sorry.

533
00:29:58,237 --> 00:30:00,503
I crossed the line.

534
00:30:00,505 --> 00:30:02,672
You obliterated a line.

535
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:06,442
I strongly concur,
and it's not an excuse,

536
00:30:06,444 --> 00:30:09,655
but over the last three
months, I've been...

537
00:30:09,658 --> 00:30:15,084
in and out of rehab.
It's been... a struggle.

538
00:30:15,086 --> 00:30:16,452
Obviously.

539
00:30:22,494 --> 00:30:28,498
Last night was messy,
but we've all been there.

540
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:32,735
So, why don't we start over
with two glasses of ginger ale.

541
00:30:32,737 --> 00:30:34,037
I'll drink to that.

542
00:30:55,033 --> 00:30:57,572
- Archie...
- We gotta talk, Jug.

543
00:30:57,575 --> 00:31:01,064
Uh, now is really not a good time, okay?

544
00:31:01,066 --> 00:31:02,932
You need to leave, okay? You gotta go.

545
00:31:02,934 --> 00:31:04,767
Why, what's going on?

546
00:31:04,769 --> 00:31:06,017
What the hell do we have here?

547
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,804
- Just leave him, all right?
- Wait.

548
00:31:07,806 --> 00:31:09,505
You're friends with these thugs?

549
00:31:09,507 --> 00:31:11,040
It's not what you think.

550
00:31:12,043 --> 00:31:13,509
Are you joining the Serpents?

551
00:31:13,512 --> 00:31:18,107
If he survives, and go ahead
and call us thugs one more time.

552
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,843
Jughead, these are the
guys who attacked me.

553
00:31:19,846 --> 00:31:22,985
Who attacked Reggie, and
Veronica and Dilton. Your friends.

554
00:31:22,987 --> 00:31:24,787
Wait, is that why you're here?

555
00:31:26,257 --> 00:31:27,857
- To warn me?
- No.

556
00:31:27,859 --> 00:31:30,226
I came here to tell you
to stay away from Betty.

557
00:31:30,229 --> 00:31:32,662
She doesn't want to see you anymore.

558
00:31:35,567 --> 00:31:38,301
Screw you, I just saw Betty yesterday...

559
00:31:40,205 --> 00:31:42,105
- She was fine.
- No, dude.

560
00:31:42,107 --> 00:31:44,264
She's been wanting to
break up with you for weeks.

561
00:31:44,267 --> 00:31:46,642
She's been agonizing over it.

562
00:31:46,644 --> 00:31:48,044
Since you crossed the dark side,

563
00:31:48,046 --> 00:31:49,645
she couldn't bring herself to do it.

564
00:31:50,482 --> 00:31:51,853
So, she sent you?

565
00:31:51,856 --> 00:31:53,516
Betty would never do that!

566
00:31:53,518 --> 00:31:55,078
If you don't believe me, then call her.

567
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:58,321
And feel free to tell her
you're a Serpent now, too.

568
00:31:58,323 --> 00:31:59,901
I bet she'll love that.

569
00:31:59,904 --> 00:32:02,271
She saw where you were headed, Jughead.

570
00:32:02,274 --> 00:32:05,762
We all did and she knows you
can't be with them and with her.

571
00:32:07,031 --> 00:32:08,631
Come on, man.

572
00:32:08,634 --> 00:32:10,733
You know it, too.

573
00:32:17,474 --> 00:32:19,374
Tell Betty I got the message.

574
00:32:21,746 --> 00:32:23,012
Yeah.

575
00:32:29,772 --> 00:32:32,640
What? Did you enjoy the show?

576
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,909
The show hasn't even started yet.

577
00:32:44,937 --> 00:32:46,937
We didn't get much of a
chance to talk last night.

578
00:32:46,939 --> 00:32:49,606
I'm choosing to blame
Betty's Britneyesque meltdown.

579
00:32:49,608 --> 00:32:51,742
I'll let you make it up to me.

580
00:32:56,716 --> 00:32:57,948
Pour moi?

581
00:32:57,951 --> 00:32:59,550
Merci.

582
00:33:04,043 --> 00:33:07,511
Ladies and gentlemen. A new
story begins in Riverdale tonight.

583
00:33:07,514 --> 00:33:10,615
A story about reinvention
and aspiration.

584
00:33:10,618 --> 00:33:13,564
This building will be the
first chapter of that story.

585
00:33:13,566 --> 00:33:17,267
Luxury apartments, shopping,
and even a golf course.

586
00:33:17,269 --> 00:33:21,739
The Southside as we know it will
be gone, replaced with a new Eden.

587
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:25,642
So let us raise our glasses
to a brighter tomorrow.

588
00:33:25,644 --> 00:33:28,312

Yes.

627
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,239
Ask me your question.

628
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:44,808
There's only one I care about now.

629
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:46,643
You want to know who I am...

630
00:36:47,637 --> 00:36:51,415
Well, here's an abandoned
house on the edge of Fox Forest

631
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,383
at the end of the Service Road.

632
00:36:54,186 --> 00:36:56,153
You'll find your answer there.

633
00:37:33,063 --> 00:37:34,462
I'm here.

634
00:37:34,465 --> 00:37:35,964
Do you see it?

635
00:37:42,529 --> 00:37:43,895
Yes.

636
00:37:44,805 --> 00:37:46,672
It's the answer to your question.

637
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,099
Put it on.

638
00:38:17,069 --> 00:38:19,770
- Why?
- Put it on and you'll see.

639
00:38:40,592 --> 00:38:43,260
- It's on.
- Now, turn around.

640
00:38:56,842 --> 00:38:58,975
Why are you doing this to me?

641
00:38:58,978 --> 00:39:01,713
To show you that we're the same.

642
00:39:13,224 --> 00:39:14,757
Hey.

643
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,927
Archie? I can't...

644
00:39:17,929 --> 00:39:21,197
Come to the Pembrooke. It's
Cheryl. Something bad happened.

645
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,100
What?

646
00:39:25,203 --> 00:39:27,236
If you hadn't come when you did...

647
00:39:27,238 --> 00:39:29,538
Where the hell is he?

648
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,274
You can put your cape away, Archie.

649
00:39:31,276 --> 00:39:32,942
The Pussycats already saved me.

650
00:39:32,945 --> 00:39:35,712
I feel so sick about this.

651
00:39:35,715 --> 00:39:38,481
Nick's a monster.

652
00:39:38,483 --> 00:39:40,155
And there's no way he hasn't done this

653
00:39:40,158 --> 00:39:41,784
before. Probably right under my nose.

654
00:39:41,786 --> 00:39:43,452
It's not your fault, Veronica.

655
00:39:43,454 --> 00:39:45,354
I wanna press charges.

656
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:47,923
I want Nick to pay.

657
00:39:47,926 --> 00:39:50,059
To suffer.

658
00:39:51,129 --> 00:39:52,695
To burn in hell.

659
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:07,176
Welcome to the Serpents.

660
00:40:07,179 --> 00:40:09,078
Officially.

661
00:40:11,349 --> 00:40:14,116
You're gonna have a hard
time hiding that from Betty.

662
00:40:16,544 --> 00:40:18,410
I think it's a non-issue now.

663
00:40:50,576 --> 00:40:52,843
I wasn't sure if you
were going to call again.

664
00:40:52,846 --> 00:40:56,092
There's one piece of
unfinished business.

665
00:40:58,369 --> 00:40:59,802
What's that?

666
00:40:59,805 --> 00:41:02,998
The fact that you've been
telling Archie about our chats.

667
00:41:03,901 --> 00:41:06,936
Betty, I've been watching you...

668
00:41:06,938 --> 00:41:08,990
You never said I couldn't tell Archie.

669
00:41:08,993 --> 00:41:12,041
You broke the rules, Betty,
and now your sister will pay.

670
00:41:12,043 --> 00:41:14,243
Please don't hurt her.

671
00:41:14,245 --> 00:41:15,911
Then give me another name.

672
00:41:15,913 --> 00:41:17,947
- Right now.
- What?

673
00:41:17,949 --> 00:41:21,217
If you want to save your
sister, give me another name.

674
00:41:21,219 --> 00:41:23,355
The name of someone guilty.

675
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:24,568
Come on, Betty.

676
00:41:24,571 --> 00:41:25,737
One little name.

677
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,640
I won't, I can't do that...

678
00:41:27,643 --> 00:41:29,175
Then I'll kill your sister.

679
00:41:29,178 --> 00:41:35,123
And your mother and your father,
and everyone you hold dear.

680
00:41:35,126 --> 00:41:36,825
Nick St. Clair.

681
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:41,157
He's staying at the Five Seasons.

682
00:41:44,493 --> 00:41:46,593
I told you we were the same.
