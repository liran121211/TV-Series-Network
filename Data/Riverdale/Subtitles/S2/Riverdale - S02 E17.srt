1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,445
Previously on Riverdale...

2
00:00:01,448 --> 00:00:03,179
Hi. Is Chic home?

3
00:00:03,182 --> 00:00:05,093
I can't eat, I can't sleep.

4
00:00:05,096 --> 00:00:07,617
I'm just obsessing over this Shady man.

5
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,287
His car was parked outside
our house for two days.

6
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,109
Jughead and I took care of it.

7
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:13,960
You have to let me stay here.

8
00:00:13,963 --> 00:00:16,764
I can't stay in the same
house as Chic anymore.

9
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:19,965
You want to turn the town
that I love into a prison?

10
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:23,269
- We are leaving now. Come on, Archie.
- Dad, I'm gonna stay.

11
00:00:23,272 --> 00:00:26,141
I know you think a prison
is a bad idea for Riverdale

12
00:00:26,144 --> 00:00:28,711
but Mr. and Mrs. Lodge really
have thought this through.

13
00:00:28,714 --> 00:00:30,404
I'm not gonna support
Hiram and Hermione.

14
00:00:30,406 --> 00:00:32,828
I'm gonna run for Mayor.
Against the Lodges.

15
00:00:32,831 --> 00:00:34,802
I wanna run for Student body President.

16
00:00:34,805 --> 00:00:37,406
- I want you to be my Co-President.
- Okay.

17
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:39,754
- I'm not a quitter, Archie.
- Yeah, me neither.

18
00:00:39,757 --> 00:00:42,726
- Which is why I want to be your running mate.
- I'd like nothing more.

19
00:00:42,728 --> 00:00:45,829
First things first, Nana, then Cheryl.

20
00:00:45,831 --> 00:00:48,198
Of course, our house
must be put in order.

21
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,268
You've gone mad, And
you leave us no choice.

22
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,051
What do you mean, no choice?

23
00:00:53,054 --> 00:00:56,006
- Mrs. Blossom, I'm looking for Cheryl.
- She's gone.

24
00:00:56,008 --> 00:00:59,276
Boarding school in Switzerland.
Don't come here again.

25
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,984
Welcome to The Sisters of Quiet Mercy,

26
00:01:03,987 --> 00:01:05,651
Home for Troubled Youth

27
00:01:06,921 --> 00:01:09,031
where a certain Cheryl Blossom finds

28
00:01:09,034 --> 00:01:11,265
herself more troubled than usual...

29
00:01:15,194 --> 00:01:17,094
It's time, girlie.

30
00:01:18,517 --> 00:01:21,276
...with nary a thing to look forward to

31
00:01:21,279 --> 00:01:23,325
except for movie nights,

32
00:01:23,328 --> 00:01:25,676
during which time, Cheryl would imagine

33
00:01:25,679 --> 00:01:27,204
what her friends might be doing.

34
00:01:31,577 --> 00:01:34,278
Seems innocent enough.
But look closer...

35
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,446
Hey, Frank, hey Dick,
we're going to the diner

36
00:01:36,448 --> 00:01:38,582
for some chocolate
phosphates with the girls.

37
00:01:38,584 --> 00:01:41,551
- You coming?
- We'll catch up.

38
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:43,596
My, my.

39
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:46,433
What do these seemingly
all-American boys have planned?

40
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:53,562
Boy, Frank, that water sure
looks great. Wanna take a dip?

41
00:01:53,565 --> 00:01:56,533
I wish I could, Dick, but I
didn't bring my swimming trunks.

42
00:01:56,536 --> 00:01:58,134
Here, the boys should have turned

43
00:01:58,136 --> 00:01:59,692
around and found another activity.

44
00:01:59,695 --> 00:02:02,105
But instead, they succumbed...

45
00:02:02,107 --> 00:02:05,008
Then again, maybe, we don't need them.

46
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:08,278
And were ensnared by deviants.

47
00:02:11,516 --> 00:02:14,684
As Cheryl Blossom withered,

48
00:02:14,687 --> 00:02:18,155
her friends were squaring off
on the most public of stages.

49
00:02:18,157 --> 00:02:21,091
Okay, now just a quick reminder,

50
00:02:21,093 --> 00:02:24,137
that this school hall
is a PTA sponsored event.

51
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,196
Oh, looks like we have
our first question.

52
00:02:26,198 --> 00:02:29,812
Yeah, no offense to the,
uh, current administration,

53
00:02:29,815 --> 00:02:32,582
but it doesn't feel like anyone's
looking out for the students

54
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:36,020
who are being bussed in from the
Southside. Is that gonna change?

55
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:38,509
Absolutely, Sweet Pea,
that's our priority.

56
00:02:38,512 --> 00:02:40,879
And no one should feel
marginalized or excluded here.

57
00:02:40,882 --> 00:02:42,621
Jughead and I will be representing all

58
00:02:42,624 --> 00:02:44,778
students, North and Southside alike.

59
00:02:44,781 --> 00:02:46,416
Next question.

60
00:02:46,418 --> 00:02:48,218
Yes, Midge?

61
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,588
My question is for Archie and Veronica.

62
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,985
Rumor has it that your
parents will soon be

63
00:02:53,988 --> 00:02:56,520
on opposite sides of
the Mayoral election,

64
00:02:56,523 --> 00:02:59,863
won't that negatively affect
your working relationship?

65
00:02:59,865 --> 00:03:01,962
Archie and I adhere
to the old maxim that

66
00:03:01,965 --> 00:03:05,606
"politics are never discussed" at
the dinner or the cafeteria table.

67
00:03:06,843 --> 00:03:09,037
Veronica and I are on the
same page about everything,

68
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:11,373
including her family's plans
for a prison on the Southside.

69
00:03:13,648 --> 00:03:15,867
In the meantime,
however, we're committed

70
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,322
to improving the quality
of life at Riverdale High,

71
00:03:18,325 --> 00:03:20,615
which means more extracurriculars...

72
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,744
Reggie and I agree. Except, add the fact

73
00:03:22,747 --> 00:03:25,718
that we can and will deliver results.

74
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:28,054
And we're chill, unlike these guys.

75
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,664
Shouldn't we be hobnobbing or something?

76
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:36,143
No, we have to go
before my mom attacks us.

77
00:03:36,146 --> 00:03:37,834
She's a heat-seeking missile.

78
00:03:40,466 --> 00:03:43,037
You can't keep dodging her forever.

79
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,074
Maybe not, but I can
damn well try. Let's go.

80
00:03:46,076 --> 00:03:48,004
FP, you should be ashamed of yourself.

81
00:03:48,007 --> 00:03:49,939
Letting my sweet, innocent daughter live

82
00:03:49,942 --> 00:03:52,013
in sin in that soup
can you call a trailer!

83
00:03:52,015 --> 00:03:53,859
You think I'm a fan of this arrangement?

84
00:03:53,862 --> 00:03:55,510
You're talking to the guy who's sleeping

85
00:03:55,513 --> 00:03:56,796
on a pull-out sofa with his son

86
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,233
so your daughter can have his bedroom.

87
00:04:00,857 --> 00:04:04,492
- You're doing that?
- Look, Alice, take it from a guy

88
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:08,863
whose son choose being homeless
over living with his old man.

89
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:13,101
Make things right with
her, before it's too late.

90
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,748
Mary, Fred, all of
Riverdale is buzzing about

91
00:04:17,751 --> 00:04:20,151
your decision to run
against my wife for Mayor.

92
00:04:20,154 --> 00:04:21,428
I've lived here my whole life,

93
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:24,195
never went to New York,
never went to prison.

94
00:04:25,089 --> 00:04:26,856
There's no one more qualified than me.

95
00:04:26,859 --> 00:04:29,984
You know, Hiram, we're still
waiting for you to sign those papers

96
00:04:29,987 --> 00:04:32,587
finalizing Fred's separation
from Lodge Industries.

97
00:04:32,589 --> 00:04:35,824
Huh. You mean like how
we're still waiting for you

98
00:04:35,826 --> 00:04:37,492
to sign that NDA that we sent over?

99
00:04:37,494 --> 00:04:40,171
Now, now, Mom and Dad,
there's no need to become

100
00:04:40,174 --> 00:04:42,474
the Montagues and the Capulets just yet.

101
00:04:42,477 --> 00:04:45,232
Yeah, Veronica and I were saying,
can't this be a fair fight?

102
00:04:45,235 --> 00:04:46,732
With no hitting below the belt?

103
00:04:46,735 --> 00:04:49,439
And everyone signing whatever
it is they need to sign?

104
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,713
Mr. and Mrs. Lodge, you
have some unexpected guests.

105
00:05:01,084 --> 00:05:04,486
Lenny, Carl How are you, fellas?

106
00:05:04,488 --> 00:05:06,921
We have some business we
need to discuss, Hiram.

107
00:05:06,923 --> 00:05:07,957
In private.

108
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,958
Well, I'd invite you up
to my study but it's late.

109
00:05:09,961 --> 00:05:12,426
Please, Hiram. A few
minutes of your time.

110
00:05:12,429 --> 00:05:14,152
Is that so much to ask for?

111
00:05:17,467 --> 00:05:19,434
No, not at all.

112
00:05:21,104 --> 00:05:23,304
Take Veronica and Hermione upstairs.

113
00:05:26,176 --> 00:05:28,410
- Mr. Lodge...
- No, it's okay, Archie.

114
00:05:28,413 --> 00:05:30,156
Just a friendly visit.

115
00:05:34,203 --> 00:05:36,370
I need to ask a favor, Archie.

116
00:05:36,373 --> 00:05:40,321
Your father is announcing
his run for Mayor on Friday.

117
00:05:40,323 --> 00:05:44,359
And his campaign, as you
know, is based on promoting

118
00:05:44,361 --> 00:05:46,307
a wholesome view of Riverdale, and

119
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,532
the place where he'd raised his family.

120
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,136
Having us both there, standing
with him, it's an important moment.

121
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:58,348
Then why isn't dad asking me himself?

122
00:05:58,351 --> 00:06:00,475
He's a proud guy, your dad.

123
00:06:00,477 --> 00:06:02,523
But I know it would
mean the world to him,

124
00:06:02,526 --> 00:06:05,749
and to me, if you showed up for this.

125
00:06:08,218 --> 00:06:10,385
Mom, of course, I'll be there for Dad.

126
00:06:15,425 --> 00:06:18,460
Hey, Chic, are you hungry?
Do you wanna order a pizza?

127
00:06:18,463 --> 00:06:20,763
Treasure hunting enthusiasts...

128
00:06:20,766 --> 00:06:24,531
- Mom, you need to see what they found.
- Made a shocking discovery...

129
00:06:24,534 --> 00:06:26,801
Authorities are searching for witnesses.

130
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:28,921
Anyone who may have more information

131
00:06:28,924 --> 00:06:31,973
is encouraged to contact
police immediately.

132
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:35,944
Whoa, easy, Alice. Hold on.
Turn to channel eight right now!

133
00:06:38,749 --> 00:06:40,992
It is not yet known how or when

134
00:06:40,995 --> 00:06:42,794
the car first entered the swamp,

135
00:06:42,797 --> 00:06:44,986
but foul play has not been ruled out.

136
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,755
They found it, FP.

137
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,890
They found it.

138
00:06:51,096 --> 00:06:54,455
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

139
00:06:59,115 --> 00:07:00,915
We should've known better.

140
00:07:01,785 --> 00:07:04,452
I should've known better.

141
00:07:04,454 --> 00:07:06,654
We should've driven that
damn car further out of town!

142
00:07:06,657 --> 00:07:08,756
No, no. How could you have
known that Junkyard Steve

143
00:07:08,758 --> 00:07:13,328
drags the swamp for people's
castoffs? It was dumb luck.

144
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:15,063
It's Jones luck, you mean.

145
00:07:15,065 --> 00:07:17,885
Shouldn't Chic be here, considering
he's the one that brained the guy?

146
00:07:17,888 --> 00:07:20,331
- Don't worry about Chic.
- Normally, I would disagree.

147
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:23,204
Definitely worry about Chic but he
doesn't know anything about the car.

148
00:07:23,206 --> 00:07:25,707
When we got to the Swamp, we wiped
the thing clean of fingerprints

149
00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:28,221
- before we pushed it in.
- Wearing gloves?

150
00:07:28,224 --> 00:07:29,911
- I think so.
- I'm pretty sure.

151
00:07:29,913 --> 00:07:32,213
- What do you mean you "think so"?
- No, no. We were.

152
00:07:32,216 --> 00:07:35,249
We 100% were.

153
00:07:41,558 --> 00:07:45,326
If anybody comes around asking
questions, we don't know anything.

154
00:07:45,328 --> 00:07:48,062
We don't talk to anyone. We
act like everything's normal.

155
00:07:48,064 --> 00:07:49,740
Including, Betty, you coming home so

156
00:07:49,743 --> 00:07:51,588
you're not nesting with
a bunch of Serpents.

157
00:07:51,591 --> 00:07:54,401
No, you are not gonna use
this to manipulate me, Mom.

158
00:07:54,404 --> 00:07:56,370
You know the deal. I come
home when Chic leaves.

159
00:07:56,372 --> 00:07:58,873
- Okay...
- Everybody, be cool.

160
00:07:58,876 --> 00:08:01,091
In the unlikely event
that something happens,

161
00:08:01,094 --> 00:08:03,193
we batten down the hatches.

162
00:08:03,196 --> 00:08:08,005
Until then, life goes on, and
nobody goes anywhere near that car.

163
00:08:08,852 --> 00:08:10,218
About last night, Archie,

164
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:14,322
my associates, Lenny
Kowalski and Carl Martin.

165
00:08:14,325 --> 00:08:18,591
My wife's mayoral campaign
is making them anxious.

166
00:08:18,594 --> 00:08:21,392
I thought Mrs. Lodge being Mayor
would be a good thing for everybody.

167
00:08:21,395 --> 00:08:24,196
Men like Lenny and Carl
see it as an act of hubris

168
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:26,397
that could bring us and our business,

169
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,878
unwanted attention from the authorities.

170
00:08:28,881 --> 00:08:31,672
I'm having dinner with them tonight
in the hopes of smoothing it over.

171
00:08:31,675 --> 00:08:34,942
But in the meantime, I need you
to keep a close eye on Veronica.

172
00:08:34,944 --> 00:08:36,778
- Do you understand?
- Of course, I will.

173
00:08:36,788 --> 00:08:40,489
But in addition to that, what if
I came with you tonight, Mr. Lodge?

174
00:08:40,492 --> 00:08:42,350
They know me from the Poker Game.

175
00:08:42,352 --> 00:08:44,385
Andre and Adams will be there, but...

176
00:08:45,284 --> 00:08:47,953
You do always find a way to
make yourself useful, Archie.

177
00:08:47,956 --> 00:08:49,844
And I've tried to get
some of my old crew down

178
00:08:49,847 --> 00:08:51,694
from Montreal, but
they've gone silent on me.

179
00:08:55,865 --> 00:08:58,900
All right, you're in.

180
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:02,705
You promised us a war.

181
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,410
Then you're on stage
looking like Buddy Holly,

182
00:09:04,412 --> 00:09:05,572
sucking up to the Northside?

183
00:09:05,575 --> 00:09:07,147
We need their votes, Sweet Pea.

184
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,391
It's the only way that
we can affect any change.

185
00:09:09,394 --> 00:09:11,712
Whoever's elected gets a
seat on the School Board.

186
00:09:11,714 --> 00:09:14,849
That means we're on the inside, that
means that they can't silence us.

187
00:09:14,851 --> 00:09:17,391
You and the Northside
princess, you mean?

188
00:09:17,394 --> 00:09:19,921
Wait, is that why you guys are pissed?

189
00:09:19,924 --> 00:09:22,570
- Betty's on our side!
- Yeah.

190
00:09:22,573 --> 00:09:25,975
I've helped the Serpents
on numerous occasions.

191
00:09:25,978 --> 00:09:28,867
I helped find the Pickens statue's head,

192
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,642
I got Cheryl to testify in court so FP,

193
00:09:31,645 --> 00:09:34,068
your king, could get early parole.

194
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,904
You did all that for your
boyfriend, not the Serpents.

195
00:09:36,906 --> 00:09:38,977
All right, take it down, Sweet Pea...

196
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,777
What, it's only a matter of time before

197
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,144
she bails on us, just like her mother.

198
00:09:43,147 --> 00:09:45,892
Okay, so your objections aren't even
about me, they're about my mom...

199
00:09:45,894 --> 00:09:48,916
Her legacy, yeah. She's an
enemy of the Serpent State

200
00:09:48,918 --> 00:09:50,818
taking shots at us in
the Register for years,

201
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,787
blaming us for crimes we didn't commit.

202
00:09:52,789 --> 00:09:55,790
Running with a turncoat's
daughter is a slap in the face.

203
00:09:55,792 --> 00:09:59,460
And for that reason alone, you're
not getting the Serpent vote.

204
00:10:05,768 --> 00:10:08,569
Let's settle this once and for all.

205
00:10:08,571 --> 00:10:10,277
We're both Bulldogs

206
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,707
who, like wolves, support the alpha.

207
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:14,894
Right now, we risk
splitting our boys' votes,

208
00:10:14,897 --> 00:10:17,311
which I told Josie I could deliver.

209
00:10:17,313 --> 00:10:22,283
Hence this contest. Mantle vs. Andrews.

210
00:10:22,286 --> 00:10:24,667
Winner gets Bulldogs' backing.

211
00:10:29,426 --> 00:10:32,727
Give up! You're gonna lose, Andrews.

212
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,697
Same as your dad...

213
00:10:40,137 --> 00:10:44,167
Talk about my dad like that again,
and next time, I break your arm.

214
00:10:47,738 --> 00:10:49,671
What do you mean, Cheryl's missing?

215
00:10:49,674 --> 00:10:52,174
Do you remember how paranoid
Cheryl was at her slumber party?

216
00:10:52,177 --> 00:10:54,845
Saying that her mom and
uncle were out to get her?

217
00:10:54,848 --> 00:10:57,849
- Well, I think they did something to her!
- What kind of something?

218
00:10:57,852 --> 00:10:59,909
Her mom said they sent her off to some

219
00:10:59,912 --> 00:11:01,941
all-girls boarding
school in Switzerland.

220
00:11:01,944 --> 00:11:05,045
Well, that's easy enough to check,
there's only one, Surval Montreux.

221
00:11:05,048 --> 00:11:07,181
Please. If Cheryl was in the Swiss Alps,

222
00:11:07,184 --> 00:11:09,351
she'd be posting parka
selfies every hour,

223
00:11:09,354 --> 00:11:11,588
but her social media's
been dead for days.

224
00:11:11,591 --> 00:11:15,069
Wait, that's a sure sign of foul play.

225
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,980
- Yeah.
- Whatever you need, Toni, I'm in.

226
00:11:17,983 --> 00:11:21,351
Me, too. Even if we have
to storm Thistlehouse.

227
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:26,956
I believe I've deduced what's
caused this imbalance in you, Cheryl.

228
00:11:27,935 --> 00:11:30,566
And what would that
be, Sister Livingston?

229
00:11:30,569 --> 00:11:34,353
I've spoken to your mother
about your brother Jason.

230
00:11:34,364 --> 00:11:36,598
And how close you were.

231
00:11:36,601 --> 00:11:39,292
So close, in fact, that your Nana would

232
00:11:39,295 --> 00:11:43,159
sometimes mix you up, isn't that right?

233
00:11:43,162 --> 00:11:48,167
She would dress you in Jason's
clothes and he in yours?

234
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:51,300
Nana's always been half-blind, Sister.

235
00:11:51,303 --> 00:11:52,869
Cataracts.

236
00:11:52,872 --> 00:11:55,777
But if there's anything
that's affected my psyche,

237
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:59,316
it's the fire hose of abuse directed
at me by my mother and my father.

238
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:02,954
You've suffered many traumas, it's true.

239
00:12:02,957 --> 00:12:06,722
But that does not excuse
your willful behavior.

240
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:10,423
Now, you will report to
the undercroft immediately,

241
00:12:10,426 --> 00:12:15,596
where you will undergo physical
therapy until you're ready to listen.

242
00:12:27,408 --> 00:12:29,706
I'm not gonna mince words, Hiram.

243
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:34,605
Your wife's campaign is risky,
putting the families in the public eye.

244
00:12:34,608 --> 00:12:37,784
But we understand that ours
is a risk-reward business.

245
00:12:37,787 --> 00:12:40,855
And your idea for a private
prison is intriguing.

246
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:45,261
So the reward we want for our
risk is a cut of the Riverdale pie.

247
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,473
How's 25% sound?

248
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:50,308
After your cut, I'd
be operating at a loss.

249
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:53,379
So, Lenny, Carl,

250
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:57,214
respectfully, I decline your kind offer.

251
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:04,860
With all due respect,
Hiram, you're all alone here.

252
00:13:04,863 --> 00:13:08,081
Your boys from Montreal, from
New York, they work for us now.

253
00:13:08,084 --> 00:13:10,761
And who've you got out
here in the boonies, hmm?

254
00:13:10,764 --> 00:13:13,831
A couple of low-level capos and
some zit-faced high school kid.

255
00:13:21,962 --> 00:13:24,463
Mr. Kowalski. Mr. Martin.

256
00:13:24,466 --> 00:13:28,261
Respectfully. Don't
underestimate Mr. Lodge or me.

257
00:13:28,264 --> 00:13:30,461
- Archie.
- I rearranged Nick St. Clair's

258
00:13:30,464 --> 00:13:32,384
pretty-boy face for him.

259
00:13:32,387 --> 00:13:36,107
I took care of Poppa Poutine
after he conspired with you, Lenny.

260
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,953
And when some hillbilly
threatened Mr. Lodge's daughter

261
00:13:38,956 --> 00:13:41,404
at his safe house, I did
the same thing to him, too.

262
00:13:41,407 --> 00:13:45,008
So don't think for a second
that we're defenseless.

263
00:13:54,326 --> 00:13:55,926
You nearly had us there, Red.

264
00:13:57,127 --> 00:14:00,762
- Hiram, consider our offer.
- Yeah.

265
00:14:00,765 --> 00:14:03,365
In the meantime, we'll be
sticking around Riverdale,

266
00:14:03,368 --> 00:14:06,402
taking in some of the
local flavors. Sound good?

267
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,645
Yeah.

268
00:14:12,699 --> 00:14:15,433
You were a mad dog in there, Archie.
You do realize that, don't you?

269
00:14:15,436 --> 00:14:18,136
I wasn't gonna let them disrespect
you, sir. Not in our town.

270
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:20,446
Nevertheless, you fire
a warning shot like that,

271
00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:23,404
you gotta be ready to back
it up, do you understand?

272
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,400
Good.

273
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:29,900
You're a good boy, Archie.

274
00:14:38,133 --> 00:14:40,901
What do Sweet Pea and
Fangs want from me, anyway?

275
00:14:40,904 --> 00:14:44,685
What will it take for them to
accept me? Do I need to wear plaid?

276
00:14:44,688 --> 00:14:48,178
Do I need to get a leather
jacket? Or a snake tattoo?

277
00:14:48,181 --> 00:14:51,749
To be fair, your mother
is Serpent Enemy No. 1.

278
00:14:51,752 --> 00:14:54,514
And meanwhile, the Shady Man's
car is out there somewhere

279
00:14:54,517 --> 00:14:56,351
and we have no idea
what's going on with it.

280
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:58,511
Yeah, I've been thinking
about that, actually.

281
00:14:58,514 --> 00:15:00,920
I know that our parents
told us to act "normal,"

282
00:15:00,923 --> 00:15:03,324
and let sleeping dogs lie,

283
00:15:04,349 --> 00:15:07,150
but riddle me this...
What is our "normal"?

284
00:15:08,471 --> 00:15:11,272
Normal is...

285
00:15:12,326 --> 00:15:16,243
investigating something when the
entire world tells us we shouldn't.

286
00:15:16,246 --> 00:15:19,246
Pumping our sources for information...

287
00:15:21,065 --> 00:15:23,264
Why do you guys even
care about this car?

288
00:15:23,267 --> 00:15:26,889
We don't, we care about the environment.

289
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:29,967
And we're writing an
article about how people

290
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,047
use Swedlow Swamp as a dumping ground.

291
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,950
The car's just part of a larger story.

292
00:15:33,953 --> 00:15:36,633
Well, according to my dad, it was
claimed by its owner this morning.

293
00:15:38,641 --> 00:15:40,041
The owner...

294
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:44,817
- who's in Riverdale?
- Yeah.

295
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,998
Now they're trying to figure out
who stole it in the first place.

296
00:15:52,597 --> 00:15:56,244
Has shacking up together driven
you both completely insane?

297
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:58,507
Talking to the Sheriff's
son about that car?

298
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,348
You didn't think that that was
going to raise any red flags?

299
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,750
No. Kevin didn't suspect anything.

300
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,485
And at least, we know
what's going on now.

301
00:16:03,487 --> 00:16:07,418
Yeah. Which is that Chic's
drug-dealer stole someone's car

302
00:16:07,421 --> 00:16:09,288
before he made his run to our house.

303
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:12,155
Dwayne didn't have wheels. He was
always borrowing his girlfriend's car.

304
00:16:12,158 --> 00:16:14,595
Someone called the Shady
Man's phone while I had it.

305
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,197
And she sounded like a crazy person,

306
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:19,500
but not like there was a lot of
love lost between her and Dwayne.

307
00:16:19,502 --> 00:16:20,902
That could be Darla, yeah.

308
00:16:20,904 --> 00:16:23,752
Is this Darla somebody that
we need to be worried about?

309
00:16:23,755 --> 00:16:25,182
Uh, I don't really know her.

310
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:26,572
Shocker! Gee, Chic,

311
00:16:26,575 --> 00:16:28,909
have you ever actually been
helpful in any way to anyone?

312
00:16:28,912 --> 00:16:31,679
- Enough, Elizabeth!
- Right. Whoa, let's stick to the plan.

313
00:16:31,681 --> 00:16:32,992
This has nothing to do with us.

314
00:16:32,995 --> 00:16:36,250
Dwayne stole Darla's car, Darla got
it back. Let's hope it ends there.

315
00:16:36,253 --> 00:16:40,521
And pack your things, Betty, because
this honeymoon is over. O-ver.

316
00:16:40,523 --> 00:16:42,991
You two playing house
and running around town

317
00:16:42,993 --> 00:16:45,393
like loose cannons is beyond the pale.

318
00:16:45,396 --> 00:16:47,230
We don't want Hal
finding out about this.

319
00:16:47,233 --> 00:16:49,464
The last thing we need is for
him to stick his nose in it.

320
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,032
I'll move out.

321
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:55,036
I'll get a place, Betty.
It's your house, not mine.

322
00:16:55,038 --> 00:16:56,447
Fine.

323
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,463
I'll come back after Chic's gone.

324
00:16:58,466 --> 00:17:01,424
Oh, I'm done with your ultimatums,
young lady. You're coming home now!

325
00:17:01,427 --> 00:17:03,544
And if you don't back me up on this, FP,

326
00:17:03,546 --> 00:17:06,514
I will tear this trailer
apart with my bare hands.

327
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:17,992
Fine.

328
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:25,266
- I'll go get my stuff.
- I'll help you pack.

329
00:17:41,384 --> 00:17:44,886
But, foolish girl, what have you done?

330
00:17:44,888 --> 00:17:47,388
You've stacked the bags
in the North-east corner,

331
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:50,258
when I specifically
told you the North-west.

332
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,393
What? No, no, you said...

333
00:17:52,395 --> 00:17:56,698
Start over. And next
time, listen, child.

334
00:17:56,701 --> 00:18:00,968
You'll never get better
if you don't listen to me.

335
00:18:03,907 --> 00:18:06,174
Now that you've barged your way in,

336
00:18:06,176 --> 00:18:08,876
go ahead, girls, ask your questions.

337
00:18:08,878 --> 00:18:12,113
You said Cheryl was away
at some boarding school?

338
00:18:13,197 --> 00:18:17,454
Honestly. I'm not in the habit of
explaining myself to school girls.

339
00:18:17,457 --> 00:18:21,659
Maybe not, but Mrs. Blossom, you
may have heard that my mother is...

340
00:18:22,492 --> 00:18:24,759
dating Sheriff Keller.

341
00:18:24,762 --> 00:18:27,929
If you won't tell us the truth,
then maybe you'll tell him.

342
00:18:27,931 --> 00:18:29,430
All right, then.

343
00:18:29,433 --> 00:18:32,861
The truth is that Cheryl

344
00:18:32,864 --> 00:18:36,900
started exhibiting
strange, deviant behavior,

345
00:18:36,903 --> 00:18:39,804
so I've sent her abroad to
a private wellness institute

346
00:18:39,807 --> 00:18:41,709
where they're trying to help her.

347
00:18:41,711 --> 00:18:43,544
You don't have to believe me...

348
00:18:43,547 --> 00:18:45,643
But here, let me show you something...

349
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,643
- Oh my God!
- She's drawn dozens like it.

350
00:18:56,646 --> 00:18:59,127
- I don't understand.
- No.

351
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,162
But Josie does, don't you?

352
00:19:01,164 --> 00:19:03,464
Cheryl was obsessed with you.

353
00:19:03,466 --> 00:19:06,267
To the point where I was
afraid she might hurt you,

354
00:19:06,277 --> 00:19:08,861
or herself, or both.

355
00:19:08,864 --> 00:19:12,632
So if you'd like me to tell that
to your mother and her boyfriend,

356
00:19:12,635 --> 00:19:16,077
and show them and the town,

357
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:18,413
Cheryl's drawings of
you, I'd be happy to.

358
00:19:18,422 --> 00:19:22,390
But hopefully, you girls have the
decency to keep this matter private.

359
00:19:26,589 --> 00:19:30,291
Josie, wait! Slow down!
We need to regroup!

360
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:33,227
If what Mrs. Blossom said
is even a tiny bit true,

361
00:19:33,229 --> 00:19:35,630
that means that Cheryl threatened me.

362
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,698
Sent me a bloody pig's heart.

363
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:40,868
I'm out, you guys. I'm done!

364
00:19:51,114 --> 00:19:53,174
Sulk all you want, Betty.

365
00:19:53,177 --> 00:19:54,643
I'm not.

366
00:19:55,706 --> 00:19:58,361
I was actually gonna see if
you would sign something for me.

367
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:01,322
A consent form.

368
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,958
What, are you trying
to get emancipated now?

369
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,526
Just because I made you move back home?

370
00:20:05,528 --> 00:20:07,781
It's so I could get a tattoo.

371
00:20:07,784 --> 00:20:09,217
A Serpent tattoo.

372
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:14,894
You have lousy timing, kiddo.

373
00:20:14,897 --> 00:20:16,463
Act normal, right?

374
00:20:17,307 --> 00:20:18,840
Life goes on, doesn't it?

375
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:22,510
You are not getting a tattoo just
to prove something to your boyfriend.

376
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:25,513
- Absolutely not!
- I'm practically a member of the Serpents.

377
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,582
- Do not say that!
- Well, do not think

378
00:20:27,584 --> 00:20:30,051
that I won't find a tattoo
parlor that will do it.

379
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,555
Mom! Betty!

380
00:20:35,925 --> 00:20:37,558
I was trying to help.

381
00:20:38,328 --> 00:20:40,261
You must be Alice.

382
00:20:40,263 --> 00:20:43,130
And you must be Betty.

383
00:20:43,133 --> 00:20:44,933
Hi. I'm Darla.

384
00:20:49,439 --> 00:20:51,005
Okay, well,

385
00:20:51,007 --> 00:20:53,143
what about something like, uh...

386
00:20:53,146 --> 00:20:55,096
"I'm all about investing
in all the citizens

387
00:20:55,099 --> 00:20:57,513
of Riverdale, not just
profiting from them."

388
00:20:57,516 --> 00:21:00,450
I like that, Jug. I mean,
that's great, it's simple...

389
00:21:00,453 --> 00:21:02,528
- Dad.
- Hey.

390
00:21:02,531 --> 00:21:04,031
Jug, what's going on?

391
00:21:04,034 --> 00:21:06,368
Oh, Jug's helping me
out here with the, uh...

392
00:21:06,371 --> 00:21:08,478
It's what your mom's calls
my "announcement address."

393
00:21:08,481 --> 00:21:12,544
I'm not much for
speechifying, t writer I know.

394
00:21:13,579 --> 00:21:15,880
Uh, then you need to meet
more writers, Mr. Andrews.

395
00:21:18,116 --> 00:21:20,133
Oh, by the way, son, your mom told me

396
00:21:20,136 --> 00:21:22,336
you'll be stopping by at
the announcement, right?

397
00:21:22,338 --> 00:21:23,704
I appreciate that.

398
00:21:27,343 --> 00:21:29,643
Honestly, I'm not
surprised that deadbeat

399
00:21:29,646 --> 00:21:31,955
Dwayne borrowed my car without asking.

400
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,448
He does it all the time.

401
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:41,321
What did surprise me was the car
turning up in a swamp in Riverdale.

402
00:21:41,324 --> 00:21:43,609
And then, just as I was getting

403
00:21:43,612 --> 00:21:45,927
ready to head back to Centerville,

404
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,430
Chic called me.

405
00:21:48,364 --> 00:21:50,031
Why would you do that?

406
00:21:50,034 --> 00:21:52,500
He thought he could
sniff out how much I knew.

407
00:21:52,502 --> 00:21:55,202
Isn't that right, Chic-a-dee?

408
00:21:55,204 --> 00:21:57,905
But there's no playing a
player, I saw right through him.

409
00:22:01,978 --> 00:22:04,946
It's okay, Dwayne was a heel.

410
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:07,114
I wouldn't be surprised
if he stole my car

411
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:11,320
to pick up some floozy
only to get himself killed.

412
00:22:17,493 --> 00:22:19,260
Like I told Chic...

413
00:22:20,597 --> 00:22:24,183
I don't particularly care
what happened to Dwayne.

414
00:22:24,186 --> 00:22:28,002
I don't see any reason to
ask any questions about him,

415
00:22:28,004 --> 00:22:30,805
especially not if I get
the ten grand he owes me.

416
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:34,763
I get that, I'm a happy camper who'll

417
00:22:34,766 --> 00:22:37,513
be out of your lives forever ever. Amen.

418
00:22:38,147 --> 00:22:41,315
If not... Well, then...

419
00:22:42,522 --> 00:22:45,418
I might just have to have a long talk

420
00:22:45,421 --> 00:22:47,757
with that handsome Sheriff of yours.

421
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,158
- We have nothing to do with...
- We don't have that kind of money on hand.

422
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,829
But if we get the money for
you, we're done here, right?

423
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:57,347
You'll leave, no questions asked?

424
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:59,934
Zip my mouth and throw away the key.

425
00:23:01,938 --> 00:23:04,778
Okay. We'll go to the
bank and make a withdrawal.

426
00:23:04,781 --> 00:23:06,047
One of you goes.

427
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:09,610
Betty, then. Betty will go.

428
00:23:10,946 --> 00:23:14,648
Mom, the bank's not open
until 9:00 tomorrow morning.

429
00:23:14,651 --> 00:23:17,855
I don't mind waiting.
Got any board games?

430
00:23:17,858 --> 00:23:20,116
It's seriously messed-up, Ronnie.

431
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:21,859
It's like me and my dad
don't even know how to talk to

432
00:23:21,861 --> 00:23:23,490
each other anymore.

433
00:23:23,493 --> 00:23:27,037
You'll work it out. You always do.

434
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:31,353
And God and Gucci willing,
Cheryl's safe, wherever she is.

435
00:23:39,275 --> 00:23:40,775
Andre?

436
00:23:45,348 --> 00:23:47,615
- Hey!
- Archie, don't!

437
00:23:52,488 --> 00:23:54,431
It's all right. It's okay.

438
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,889
Adams?

439
00:24:05,892 --> 00:24:07,768
You double-crossing piece of...

440
00:24:13,342 --> 00:24:16,079
Tell your girlfriend's
father to take the deal.

441
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,226
So, Adams has been turned...

442
00:24:28,229 --> 00:24:30,523
God knows how long he's
been working against us.

443
00:24:30,526 --> 00:24:33,013
Kowalski and Martin must
have offered him a tidy sum.

444
00:24:33,016 --> 00:24:35,246
Or he sensed that
we're weak, vulnerable,

445
00:24:35,249 --> 00:24:37,021
and he chose to align with our enemies.

446
00:24:37,024 --> 00:24:40,192
- Either way, he's made a grave mistake.
- Yeah.

447
00:24:41,529 --> 00:24:43,429
The message from Lenny
and Carl is clear.

448
00:24:43,431 --> 00:24:45,631
Either cut us in or
suffer the consequences.

449
00:24:45,633 --> 00:24:48,676
And with Adams a turncoat
and Andre in the hospital,

450
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:51,038
we are, essentially, unprotected.

451
00:24:51,041 --> 00:24:52,778
I'll keep watch in the lobby.

452
00:24:52,781 --> 00:24:54,663
I did it for my dad,
I'll do it for you guys.

453
00:24:54,666 --> 00:24:56,575
That's a selfless offer, Archie.

454
00:24:56,577 --> 00:24:59,245
But, alas, a short-term
solution to a long-term problem.

455
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:01,796
- So what do we do?
- We circle the wagons.

456
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:04,866
Hermione, any of the campaigning
you need to do, you do from here.

457
00:25:04,869 --> 00:25:06,759
Veronica, if you're not
at school, you're here.

458
00:25:06,762 --> 00:25:08,019
I don't want you out and about.

459
00:25:08,022 --> 00:25:10,790
- Archie, you escort her to and fro.
- Absolutely.

460
00:25:10,792 --> 00:25:13,058
And long-term? What's the plan?

461
00:25:13,067 --> 00:25:16,502
Long-term... Long-term...

462
00:25:17,932 --> 00:25:19,632
I have no idea.

463
00:25:27,358 --> 00:25:30,008
It's our joint-account, so
you shouldn't have any trouble.

464
00:25:30,011 --> 00:25:31,177
Okay.

465
00:25:33,514 --> 00:25:38,117
Hey! Straight to the bank
and right back, blondie.

466
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:52,226
Now, Roseanne, you behave
yourself while I'm out.

467
00:25:52,229 --> 00:25:54,834
You've been fed, you've
been to the water closet,

468
00:25:54,836 --> 00:25:56,769
you should be set till I come back.

469
00:25:56,778 --> 00:25:59,345
If you have to go, hold it.

470
00:25:59,348 --> 00:26:01,907
You can spend the day
watching your programs.

471
00:26:53,501 --> 00:26:56,952
On the 14th of July in 1789,

472
00:26:56,955 --> 00:27:00,765
a state prison on the east side
of Paris, known as the Bastille...

473
00:27:00,768 --> 00:27:04,570
Antoinette Topaz to
the Principal's office.

474
00:27:04,572 --> 00:27:08,641
Antoinette Topaz, please report
to the Principal's office.

475
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:22,521
Call for you. She said it was urgent.

476
00:27:25,538 --> 00:27:28,773
- Hello?
- She's not far away.

477
00:27:28,776 --> 00:27:31,349
Who... Who is this?

478
00:27:31,352 --> 00:27:34,781
Cheryl! She's nearby.

479
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:38,601
Nana Rose? Nana Rose, where is she?

480
00:27:38,604 --> 00:27:42,077
With the Sisters of...

481
00:27:44,711 --> 00:27:47,412
Hello? Nana Rose!

482
00:27:54,932 --> 00:27:57,132
Now, whatever do you
think you're doing, Mother?

483
00:28:03,374 --> 00:28:05,364
Hey, Mom. I'm just about to head out.

484
00:28:05,366 --> 00:28:09,068
No, Elizabeth. There's
another one in the house now.

485
00:28:10,204 --> 00:28:11,603
What? What are you talking about?

486
00:28:11,605 --> 00:28:14,974
The guy that attacked Chic
at the hostel, that manager?

487
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,859
Oh, my God! Should I call someone?

488
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:18,294
I don't know.

489
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:22,166
Just, Elizabeth, whatever
you do, do not come home.

490
00:28:22,169 --> 00:28:24,402
Mom!

491
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:34,626
Wait, so that was Nana
Rose Blossom who paged you?

492
00:28:34,628 --> 00:28:35,756
Yeah, it was.

493
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:37,502
Although, we got disconnected before she

494
00:28:37,505 --> 00:28:39,202
could say too much beyond the fact that

495
00:28:39,205 --> 00:28:43,035
Cheryl was nearby and that
she was with the Sisters.

496
00:28:43,037 --> 00:28:46,238
- The Sisters? What Sisters?
- I don't know.

497
00:28:46,241 --> 00:28:49,676
Maybe there's a re-education
camp called the Sisters.

498
00:28:51,195 --> 00:28:53,903
Well, there's a Sisters of Quiet Mercy,

499
00:28:53,906 --> 00:28:56,017
but that's more like an orphanage.

500
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,296
I don't think they do
gay conversion there.

501
00:28:58,299 --> 00:28:59,898
Well, who would know for sure?

502
00:29:00,721 --> 00:29:02,421
Oh, my God, of course!

503
00:29:02,424 --> 00:29:05,054
Yes, it absolutely could be
The Sisters of Quiet Mercy.

504
00:29:05,057 --> 00:29:06,945
It's one of the few
places in the country

505
00:29:06,948 --> 00:29:08,968
that still does conversion therapy.

506
00:29:08,971 --> 00:29:10,804
Of the books, of course.

507
00:29:10,807 --> 00:29:12,907
What the hell decade is this?

508
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:16,635
During Prohibition, the Sisters
ran a distillery in the basement.

509
00:29:16,637 --> 00:29:18,971
They used to smuggle booze
out to Sweetwater River

510
00:29:18,973 --> 00:29:21,006
via a tunnel that still exists today.

511
00:29:21,008 --> 00:29:23,375
Wait, a tunnel we could
use to get to Cheryl?

512
00:29:23,377 --> 00:29:26,945
Potentially. Gay boys in the
program use it to sneak out,

513
00:29:26,947 --> 00:29:29,982
to hook-up with perfectly nice
young men like myself in Fox Forest.

514
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:34,077
Wait, Kevin, can you lead us to
this secret gay hook-up tunnel?

515
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,654
I can probably find it.

516
00:29:35,656 --> 00:29:37,556
But we should go at night.

517
00:29:40,668 --> 00:29:42,475
Why did you come back, Betty?

518
00:29:42,478 --> 00:29:44,007
You know, it took more than a week to

519
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:45,897
get that pepper spray out of my eyes.

520
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,934
Well, next time maybe, don't
attack my brother with a box-cutter.

521
00:29:49,678 --> 00:29:52,503
It's all here. Nice work.

522
00:29:52,506 --> 00:29:55,074
Okay, well you have your money. Now, go!

523
00:29:55,076 --> 00:29:56,975
What're you talking
about? I just got here.

524
00:29:56,977 --> 00:30:00,579
Yeah. And Riverdale's so
much nicer than Centerville.

525
00:30:00,589 --> 00:30:04,924
And this house, I could
get used to this house.

526
00:30:04,927 --> 00:30:07,226
- You said if we gave you the money, you'll leave.
- Chic!

527
00:30:07,229 --> 00:30:10,031
Or what? You think
you three can take us?

528
00:30:10,034 --> 00:30:11,333
Try it.

529
00:30:11,336 --> 00:30:13,413
Sit your ass down, Chic.

530
00:30:13,416 --> 00:30:16,702
Or I'll cut out your sister's eyes.

531
00:30:25,874 --> 00:30:28,531
You think you two can take all of us?

532
00:30:28,534 --> 00:30:30,561
Try it.

533
00:30:30,564 --> 00:30:32,097
You brought back-up?

534
00:30:32,777 --> 00:30:36,765
Does that mean you want me to go to
the Sheriff's, start making a stink?

535
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:39,269
Well, that's your call
but my back-up and me,

536
00:30:39,272 --> 00:30:44,304
we're friends with the Sheriff's son,
so whose side do you think he'll pick?

537
00:30:44,307 --> 00:30:47,882
The Coopers are one of the most
respected families in Riverdale.

538
00:30:47,885 --> 00:30:50,261
You two are just a couple
of Centerville scumbags.

539
00:30:50,264 --> 00:30:52,865
Anything that was in your
car, the swamp washed away,

540
00:30:52,867 --> 00:30:54,836
else we'd have heard about it by now, so

541
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:56,904
why don't you just
grab the money and run.

542
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:29,942
Sorry about your door, Mrs. Cooper.

543
00:31:32,747 --> 00:31:34,745
Thank you, Jughead.

544
00:31:34,748 --> 00:31:36,751
Thank your friends for me.

545
00:31:36,754 --> 00:31:39,184
We're Serpents. It's what we do.

546
00:31:41,829 --> 00:31:44,863
Betty, you've been telling me
something that I didn't want to hear.

547
00:31:45,826 --> 00:31:47,125
And I'm sorry.

548
00:31:48,662 --> 00:31:50,128
But Chic...

549
00:31:52,232 --> 00:31:54,754
You've put us in danger twice now.

550
00:31:54,757 --> 00:31:56,256
So I think that...

551
00:31:57,638 --> 00:32:00,138
You should do what you
said and leave this house.

552
00:32:01,742 --> 00:32:05,043
I will. I'll find a place.

553
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:08,413
Do it quickly.

554
00:32:08,416 --> 00:32:10,879
Because you're not gonna
spend another night here.

555
00:32:17,391 --> 00:32:21,533
I appreciate you escorting me home
but I'm in for the rest of the night

556
00:32:21,536 --> 00:32:25,464
so you, Archiekins,
are officially off-duty.

557
00:32:25,467 --> 00:32:27,786
Hey Archie, do you have a minute?

558
00:32:28,736 --> 00:32:30,636
Yeah, of course, Mr. Lodge.

559
00:32:31,338 --> 00:32:32,838
I'll see you tomorrow.

560
00:32:41,515 --> 00:32:43,515
I've made my decision, Archie.

561
00:32:43,517 --> 00:32:45,283
If I don't let Kowalski and Martin

562
00:32:45,286 --> 00:32:47,352
invest in the prison, they'll destroy it

563
00:32:47,354 --> 00:32:49,295
and everything I'm trying to build here.

564
00:32:49,298 --> 00:32:52,233
These men don't share my
ambition to go legitimate.

565
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:54,660
By "invest," you mean you'll
pay them a cut for "protection"?

566
00:32:54,662 --> 00:32:57,562
And I won't risk a war
nor my family's safety.

567
00:32:57,564 --> 00:32:59,861
Not at this moment, not
when we're defenseless.

568
00:33:05,513 --> 00:33:06,945
Mr. Lodge?

569
00:33:08,147 --> 00:33:10,881
You haven't told them you're
agreeing yet, have you?

570
00:33:10,884 --> 00:33:12,989
Well, I am meeting
them for dinner tonight.

571
00:33:14,415 --> 00:33:17,315
Why? What are you thinking?

572
00:33:22,248 --> 00:33:24,581
I think maybe we should just start.

573
00:33:26,093 --> 00:33:27,626
Yeah, maybe you're right.

574
00:33:29,096 --> 00:33:30,462
I'm sorry, Fred.

575
00:33:31,498 --> 00:33:35,600
It's okay. You know,
he's busy. I get it.

576
00:33:36,403 --> 00:33:38,170
I'm glad you're here though.

577
00:33:48,982 --> 00:33:51,516
Good afternoon. My name is Fred Andrews.

578
00:33:52,752 --> 00:33:56,681
And I stand before you today,
a humble resident of this town

579
00:33:56,684 --> 00:34:00,392
to announce my candidacy for Mayor.

580
00:34:00,394 --> 00:34:02,142
We're on opposite sides, Andrews.

581
00:34:02,145 --> 00:34:03,361
Why should I help you?

582
00:34:03,363 --> 00:34:06,298
At school, we're on opposite sides, yes.

583
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,310
But bigger pictures,
Reggie, where do you stand?

584
00:34:08,313 --> 00:34:09,611
With the Lodges or against them?

585
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:12,871
I'm against the Southside. My
dad's for the prison so am I.

586
00:34:12,873 --> 00:34:14,840
Me too. I think it's the future.

587
00:34:14,842 --> 00:34:17,314
But somebody from the
outside is threatening that.

588
00:34:17,317 --> 00:34:21,046
And we need to show them that that
is not how things go in Riverdale.

589
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:24,390
Stand with me tonight and
the Bulldogs' votes are yours.

590
00:34:36,029 --> 00:34:39,231
Sorry, I had to wait for
my parents to do bed-check.

591
00:34:49,076 --> 00:34:50,709
Movie night.

592
00:34:51,345 --> 00:34:53,345
Clean yourself up.

593
00:35:08,433 --> 00:35:09,999
According to my Intel,

594
00:35:10,002 --> 00:35:12,863
the tunnel that leads from the
main residence comes out here.

595
00:35:12,866 --> 00:35:15,066
Okay. That's our way in, then.

596
00:35:15,069 --> 00:35:17,135
All right, Kevin, you stay here.

597
00:35:17,137 --> 00:35:19,237
If we're not back in 15
minutes, call your dad.

598
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:20,539
Okay.

599
00:35:49,303 --> 00:35:52,737
Okay. And when we get to the
main building, what happens then?

600
00:35:52,739 --> 00:35:55,707
We search each and every
damn room until we find her.

601
00:35:55,709 --> 00:35:58,143
Let's go.

602
00:36:08,088 --> 00:36:10,856
Okay, let's split up. We'll
cover twice the ground.

603
00:36:10,858 --> 00:36:13,058
- Okay. But be careful.
- Okay.

604
00:36:16,563 --> 00:36:18,163
Cheryl!

605
00:36:23,888 --> 00:36:25,310
Cheryl!

606
00:36:28,373 --> 00:36:31,061
Cheryl, are you in here?

607
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:33,878
- Toni?
- We came to rescue you.

608
00:36:33,881 --> 00:36:35,046
You did?

609
00:37:00,741 --> 00:37:03,161
Cheryl, Toni, there are
a bunch of nuns coming.

610
00:37:03,164 --> 00:37:04,797
We have to go, come on!

611
00:37:12,686 --> 00:37:14,019
This way!

612
00:37:47,087 --> 00:37:48,553
Come on!

613
00:37:57,664 --> 00:37:58,997
Let's go!

614
00:38:04,604 --> 00:38:06,178
I don't understand.

615
00:38:06,181 --> 00:38:07,631
Is he standing us up?

616
00:38:08,842 --> 00:38:11,042
Maybe our first message
wasn't clear enough.

617
00:38:11,045 --> 00:38:13,111
Mr. Kowalski. Mr. Martin.

618
00:38:13,113 --> 00:38:15,897
That was Hiram Lodge calling
with his deep regrets.

619
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,412
And to say that you should both
go outside. To check on your car.

620
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,499
What the hell is this?

621
00:38:42,475 --> 00:38:44,843
This is a message from the Dark Circle.

622
00:38:44,845 --> 00:38:48,847
Hiram Lodge doesn't stand alone.
And Riverdale is protected.

623
00:38:48,849 --> 00:38:50,882
You should leave before it's too late.

624
00:39:01,971 --> 00:39:05,870
Before I leave, I don't
suppose you could tell me,

625
00:39:05,873 --> 00:39:09,676
what was so important that you
couldn't be there for your dad?

626
00:39:09,678 --> 00:39:11,645
Believe me, I had every
intention of going.

627
00:39:11,647 --> 00:39:13,480
You used to worship your father,

628
00:39:13,482 --> 00:39:15,233
you used to play music.

629
00:39:15,236 --> 00:39:17,936
You, Jughead, Betty,
you were inseparable!

630
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:22,108
But I'm looking at you now and
I don't know who you've become.

631
00:39:24,693 --> 00:39:26,727
Who are you, Archie?

632
00:39:28,597 --> 00:39:30,931
I asked Jughead to thank you for me,

633
00:39:30,933 --> 00:39:34,168
but I reconsidered, because
I wanted to do it myself.

634
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:37,397
So, thank you for what you did.

635
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,006
I also wanted you to
hear it directly from me

636
00:39:40,009 --> 00:39:44,178
that I am done attacking
and disavowing the Southside.

637
00:39:45,481 --> 00:39:49,049
It's where I'm from, and
I should be proud of that.

638
00:39:50,319 --> 00:39:53,015
And from now on, I will be.

639
00:39:53,018 --> 00:39:54,755
And like my daughter,

640
00:39:54,758 --> 00:39:58,792
I will fight tooth and nail for it.

641
00:40:00,536 --> 00:40:03,594
- There he is.
- Came as soon as I could.

642
00:40:03,597 --> 00:40:06,300
- New wheels, Mr. Lodge?
- Indeed. But not mine.

643
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:08,068
The car's yours, Archie.

644
00:40:08,071 --> 00:40:11,003
Ronnie, Mr. and Mrs.
Lodge, I can't accept this.

645
00:40:11,006 --> 00:40:13,140
Especially, since, from now on,

646
00:40:13,142 --> 00:40:15,702
you're going to be driving our
daughter wherever she needs to go.

647
00:40:17,572 --> 00:40:20,573
Say yes, Archie. Say yes!

648
00:40:23,167 --> 00:40:24,816
Yeah. Yes!

649
00:40:24,819 --> 00:40:26,385
Great.

650
00:40:26,388 --> 00:40:28,455
I'll get the engine started.

651
00:40:31,093 --> 00:40:33,345
Now, Archie. Last night was the very

652
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:35,596
definition of a short-term solution.

653
00:40:35,598 --> 00:40:36,763
I'm fully aware of that.

654
00:40:39,268 --> 00:40:41,001
But our enemies will be back,

655
00:40:41,012 --> 00:40:44,913
and not just for 25%. For everything.

656
00:40:44,916 --> 00:40:47,143
We'll be ready for them, sir

657
00:40:48,584 --> 00:40:51,485
Get in, lover boy.
I'll drive us to school!

658
00:40:57,186 --> 00:40:58,919
Be careful!

659
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,447
So, now that you're free,

660
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:05,183
what's your first move gonna be?

661
00:41:05,186 --> 00:41:09,563
Well, Toni, if revenge is
a dish best served cold,

662
00:41:09,566 --> 00:41:12,832
my mother and Uncle Claudius better
brace themselves for a polar vortex.

663
00:41:14,203 --> 00:41:17,037
But there's something even
more pressing than that...

664
00:41:22,077 --> 00:41:24,383
Kevin, I hear I'm back just in time for

665
00:41:24,386 --> 00:41:26,511
Carrie: The Musical,
which you're directing.

666
00:41:26,514 --> 00:41:29,749
You are. And I'm having
auditions this afternoon.

667
00:41:29,752 --> 00:41:33,386
Well, as far as the lead
role's concerned, cancel them.

668
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:37,657
I'm obviously Riverdale
High's Carrie White.

669
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,959
Oh.

670
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,467
And this school's gonna burn.

671
