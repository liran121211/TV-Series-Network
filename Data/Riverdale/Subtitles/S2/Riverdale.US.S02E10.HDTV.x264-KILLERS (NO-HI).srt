1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,418
Previously on Riverdale:

2
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:05,005
Bringing the Southside
under control is my priority as mayor.

3
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:09,134
If it means arresting every single
Serpent in sight, so be it.

4
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:11,636
How many times will we
push each other away?

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,596
Until it sticks.

6
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:16,766
- You tried to rape me.
- You won't say anything to anyone.

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,979
- There's a reason it's called hush money.
- Thank you for that, Mommy.

8
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:22,689
Cheryl is telling the truth.

9
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:26,485
- Nick tried to do it to me.
- Nick St. Clair hurt you?

10
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:29,488
- The St. Claire had a car accident.
- Karma's a bitch.

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,824
This is where we end this
and stop the Black Hood.

12
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:35,869
- But right now I need you with me.
- Archie.

13
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:39,623
I love you, too, Archie Andrews.

14
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:49,633
Know how there are some towns
where bad things always seem to happen?

15
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:53,261
Well, Riverdale has become
one of those towns.

16
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:55,263
The most recent horror?

17
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:58,725
The school janitor turned out
to be a serial killer.

18
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:02,187
But we were putting him away
along with our Christmas decorations.

19
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,608
Now we were back to your
typical small-town intrigues.

20
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,862
Clandestine meetings behind
closed doors and the like.

21
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:16,159
Yes, by and large, it was
business as usual in Riverdale.

22
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:18,495
Good news, Cheryl.

23
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,540
I've earned nearly enough
to pay for that tree

24
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:24,167
and those ludicrous presents
you bought yourself.

25
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:25,085
Bravo.

26
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:30,340
Never mind that the last two weeks,
I've been living in a bordello with a...

27
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:31,466
woman of the night.

28
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,678
Well, it's not that different
from when I was younger

29
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:38,265
and I had my pick of gentlemen callers
lining up every evening.

30
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:41,142
Good God,
you almost sound proud.

31
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,770
You wanted me to get a job,
Cheryl, and I did.

32
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:48,441
Providing comfort and companionship
to the lonely men of Riverdale.

33
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:55,448
- Veronica, have a minute?
- Just checking in.

34
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,783
See how you're feeling.

35
00:01:56,867 --> 00:02:00,829
Ah. Checking to make sure
I'm on board with the "plan"?

36
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,706
Don't worry, I am.

37
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:06,209
- You're gonna be at ground zero.
- The eye of the potential hurricane.

38
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:08,837
You said that when
I wanted to shop in SoHo

39
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,922
during Occupy Wall Street,
and I was fine.

40
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,925
- Uh...
- Dad, Mom, trust me.

41
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:18,430
I'll keep my classmates from revolting.
And they'll be none the wiser.

42
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:28,940
Hey, Arch, did you say anything
to anybody about my medical bill?

43
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:34,738
Because it's been paid, all $86,000 of it.
Something called an angel donation.

44
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,991
No. Well, I mean, Veronica,
but she wouldn't...

45
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:41,953
- I'll ask her.
- No.

46
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:45,123
I'll get to the bottom of it.
You just focus on school.

47
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:49,210
- Haven't seen that guitar for a while.
- Yeah, well, I've been busy.

48
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:52,964
I spent break writing songs.
I'll start a band like the Fred Heads.

49
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:55,467
If you do,
do that in the garage.

50
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,469
That's why
I soundproofed it for you.

51
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:15,654
- Ronnie.
- Hey.

52
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,698
Hey, did you tell anyone
about my dad's hospital bill?

53
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,367
Hmm. Did I?

54
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,370
I may have mentioned it
to my mom and dad in passing.

55
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,498
- Ronnie...
- They wanted to help.

56
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,375
And they have
the means to help.

57
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,126
What, is your dad upset?

58
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:31,211
Are you?

59
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:32,921
Upset?

60
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:37,676
Ronnie...  I am crazy about you.

61
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:53,441
Students of
Riverdale High, this is your principal.

62
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:57,946
E-mails have been sent to your parents,
but effective immediately,

63
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,699
Southside High School
is shut down.

64
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:04,703
Its students will be transferred
to other schools in the district,

65
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:05,745
including this one.

66
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,206
I believe the statement
we're releasing

67
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:11,668
- Guys, let's not overreact.
- Will address your concerns.

68
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,420
You should receive it shortly.

69
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:17,340
- I'm sure you have many questions.
- Like "what the hell?"

70
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,009
It goes without saying,

71
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,679
we are welcoming these students
with open minds, hearts and arms.

72
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,639
- Cheryl?
- Hell, no.

73
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,183
My home life is
a Dickensian nightmare.

74
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:31,521
- I won't have school turn into one, too.
- This won't affect course schedules

75
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,023
or locker assignments.

76
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,482
Thank you.
That is all.

77
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,693
Wait, what does that mean?

78
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:40,488
- It means Jughead's coming back.
- Betty, are you ready for that?

79
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:43,199
Of course.
We're fine.

80
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,495
- But why is this happening now?
- Who knows?

81
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:50,415
It's probably some bizarre,
byzantine town ordinance

82
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,250
we couldn't possibly understand.

83
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:56,838
In the meantime, let's receive the exiles
as if they were our own flesh and blood.

84
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:00,300
Who's in? Hmm?

85
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:03,887
Wow, Jones, props to you.
It's very Lovecraftian.

86
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,431
Which I'm sure was
the intention.

87
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,684
But did you write
this on a typewriter?

88
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:14,439
Yeah, I wanted to
get into Lovecraft's headspace.

89
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:19,110
So, it wasn't like Betty bought you
a typewriter for Christmas or anything?

90
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:20,028
No comment.

91
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,324
What's going on?

92
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:27,577
This hellhole's officially closed.
No more Southside High.

93
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,620
What? How?

94
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:32,582
It's gonna be quarantined.
We're going to different schools.

95
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,293
This doesn't make sense.
Where are you guys going?

96
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:40,131
Same as you, and you, and Fangs.
We're going to Riverdale High.

97
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:44,594
Think of all those
Northside heads to knock.

98
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,684
Thank you, Principal Weatherbee.
Keep me posted.

99
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:55,855
Well, it's done.

100
00:05:56,397 --> 00:06:00,443
Any minute my phone will start exploding
with calls from outraged parents.

101
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:04,447
It'll be news for two days. Look how
people stopped talking about Black Hood.

102
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:05,949
After a few weeks,

103
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:09,828
we'll quietly go about purchasing
the land beneath Southside High.

104
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,747
And you, Madam Mayor,
will get your commission.

105
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:15,834
A sizable donation
to your re-election campaign.

106
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,760
Mom? Dad?

107
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,832
All right, whoever you are...

108
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,501
Betty, don't shoot.
It's just me.

109
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:03,089
Oh, my God. Polly, I almost pepper-sprayed you.
What are you doing home?

110
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:07,218
- I just came to get a few things.
- Oh, my God. What happened to the twins?

111
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:09,137
- I had them, Betty.
- You did?

112
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:15,101
You didn't call us.
Mom will be crushed that she wasn't there.

113
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:17,312
- We have to call her.
- No, Betty, we don't.

114
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:20,190
Leaders of the Farm think
it's best if I sever all ties.

115
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,568
The leaders of the Farm.
You mean the cult that you joined.

116
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:27,280
It's not a cult. And on the Farm,
there's no stigma on my babies.

117
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,158
- You can tell Mom and Dad.
- Tell them what?

118
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,911
I don't know anything.
Do they have names?

119
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,245
Juniper and Dagwood.

120
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:38,041
Oh, my God.
Polly, please, okay?

121
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,001
Mom and Dad hurt you, yes,

122
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:44,255
but what you're doing right now is
cruel, and selfish, and vindictive.

123
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,966
I'm really sorry,
Betty, but I gotta go.

124
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:53,932
That's mine, by the way. The Farm probably
doesn't have electricity, anyway.

125
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:10,907
Archie Andrews?

126
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,244
I'm Special Agent Adams
with the FBI.

127
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,329
Hi.

128
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,748
Can we take a walk?

129
00:08:26,257 --> 00:08:28,884
I always loved this park.
Came here every weekend.

130
00:08:28,968 --> 00:08:32,096
Played ball with my dad,
ran around with my dog.

131
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:35,099
- You're from Riverdale?
- I am. Born and raised.

132
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,354
- That's why I was assigned this case.
- What case? Why do you need to talk to me?

133
00:08:41,105 --> 00:08:42,982
How well do you know
Hiram Lodge?

134
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:45,276
I date his daughter.

135
00:08:45,818 --> 00:08:49,405
We believe Hiram Lodge is conducting
criminal activity here in Riverdale

136
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:51,073
with ties to organized crime.

137
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:55,619
Between your relationship and your
father's connections to Lodge Industries,

138
00:08:55,703 --> 00:08:59,665
you're in a unique position to help us
take him down once and for all.

139
00:09:00,124 --> 00:09:03,460
- Mr. Lodge is a businessman.
- Let's talk about that.

140
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:08,674
A few months ago, one of Hiram's
business associates came

141
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,551
to visit with his family.

142
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:11,760
The St. Claire.

143
00:09:12,303 --> 00:09:15,347
They were going to invest
in Hiram's SoDale project,

144
00:09:15,431 --> 00:09:18,017
but for whatever reason,
the deal fell through.

145
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,562
The St. Claire went back to New York,
and their son, Nicholas,

146
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:26,233
was soon admitted to Columbia-Presbyterian
with life-threatening injuries.

147
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:29,486
- You think Mr. Lodge is responsible?
- We do.

148
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:32,656
- Veronica is my girlfriend.
- And her father

149
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,284
is an extremely dangerous man.

150
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:38,162
- He's hurt people, maybe worse.
- What do you expect?

151
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,664
Find out what happened to
Nick St. Clair.

152
00:09:40,748 --> 00:09:41,707
The truth.

153
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:47,421
- Based on how you do on that assignment...
- I have not agreed to anything.

154
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:50,591
Anyway, is this even legal,
what you're asking me to do?

155
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:54,678
- Don't you have to talk to my dad?
- He's in business with Lodge.

156
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:57,765
For all we know, he's part of
Hiram's criminal activities.

157
00:09:57,848 --> 00:10:02,061
- Get real, my dad is not a part of this.
- We don't know that, not for sure.

158
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,856
Maybe if you helped us,
we could be more certain.

159
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:09,610
Look, I know it's
a lot to take in.

160
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:13,572
Think about it and call me.

161
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:27,002
Well, that is one
mystery solved.

162
00:10:27,086 --> 00:10:31,256
- What?
- Hiram and Hermione paid my hospital bill.

163
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:35,302
- Dad, you can't accept that money.
- I already did.

164
00:10:35,386 --> 00:10:39,723
Traded 20 percent of Andrews Construction
to cover the 86 grand. A good deal.

165
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:40,891
What? Dad, no.

166
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:44,186
I can't take out another
mortgage on the house.

167
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:46,772
Lodges will let me buy
it back in pieces.

168
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:49,191
But that just puts us
in deeper with them.

169
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,944
They just bailed me out of a jam.
What's the problem?

170
00:10:56,448 --> 00:11:00,285
Mayor McCoy's obviously hiding
something about this Southside debacle.

171
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:05,207
- Sorry, what?
- Schools don't just close overnight.

172
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:11,255
- Mom, Polly...
- Oh. Have you talked to her?

173
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:13,507
I've left messages to make sure

174
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:17,427
she has everything she needs
and ask what color she wants the nursery.

175
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:21,765
- I was wondering if you'd heard from her.
- No, not in a while.

176
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:28,856
"Mayor McCoy has deemed Southside High
a public health hazard

177
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:33,068
due to toxic fumes from
the methamphetamine lab in the basement."

178
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:37,030
There was no meth,
just Jingle-Jangle.

179
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:40,325
So, the worm turns,
and it's back to Riverdale High, huh?

180
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:44,913
- Something smells fishy.
- Damn straight, something smells fishy.

181
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:48,041
The real reason
you don't wanna go back.

182
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,334
What do you mean?

183
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,255
Oh, she just walked
through the door.

184
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:56,717
Thanks for
meeting with me.

185
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,135
Yeah, no problem.

186
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,387
I was gonna reach out
and clear the air

187
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:05,184
before Dr. Beaker awkwardly
pairs us up in chemistry or something.

188
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:08,228
Actually, I wanted to meet
because I need help.

189
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:13,275
You remember that baby
my mom put up for adoption?

190
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,611
Long lost Cooper sibling?
Yeah.

191
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:19,114
I was hoping you'd put me
in touch with your social worker

192
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:22,117
to see if she can
help me find him.

193
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:28,373
Betty, of course I'll help,
but why the sudden need for a brother?

194
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,628
Polly had the twins.

195
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:36,048
She didn't even call
my mom to tell her.

196
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:42,387
I know my mom's crazy,
but she's also... really sad.

197
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:47,100
So, maybe if she found her son,
having him in our lives...

198
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:52,397
- I'll send you Ms. Weiss' number.
- Thank you, Jug.

199
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:57,194
As for clearing the air, I'm happy
you'll be back at Riverdale High.

200
00:13:00,656 --> 00:13:04,785
- Thank you for inviting me up.
- There's always room at our table.

201
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:07,996
I wanted to say thanks
for helping my dad.

202
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,165
- We were happy to.
- He'd do the same.

203
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:14,461
In return though,
I've put together a welcoming committee

204
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,296
for tomorrow's arrivals,

205
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,049
and I'm hoping
you'll stand by my side, Archie.

206
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:22,010
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

207
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,766
Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Lodge,
what about Southside High closing?

208
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:31,812
It's close to the SoDale project.
Isn't that bad for business?

209
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:35,774
Drugs, gangs and violence.
That's bad for business, Archie.

210
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:36,942
Mm.

211
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:40,195
So, investors like
the St. Claire are fine with it?

212
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:44,783
Archie, um,
the St. Claire aren't investors anymore.

213
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:45,951
Oh.

214
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:50,163
- Not after what Nick did to Cheryl.
- What happened? Did he get charged?

215
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:55,544
We severed ties with the St. Claire.
Don't think we called after the accident.

216
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:56,461
Accident?

217
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:59,798
Nick St. Clair had an accident driving,
um, in Vail.

218
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,509
Or was it on the slopes?

219
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:04,886
You know, I'm not sure.

220
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:08,724
Is he...?

221
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,352
Is he okay?

222
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:15,063
Well, you know,
from all reports,

223
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:18,775
he's recovered enough to be back at, uh...
Was it Greenwich Prep?

224
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:21,778
- Yep.
- And may we never hear from him again.

225
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:23,322
Mm.

226
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:55,687
Friends. On behalf of the students
and faculty here at Riverdale High,

227
00:14:55,771 --> 00:14:57,022
welcome to your new school.

228
00:14:57,105 --> 00:15:00,359
To ease this transition,
they've set up a registration desk

229
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:05,113
where you can get locker assignments,
schedules and a list of extracurriculars.

230
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:07,366
We encourage every one of you

231
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:10,827
to drink deeply from the cup
that is fair Riverdale.

232
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,413
Stand down, Eva Peron.

233
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:24,925
There's the school spirit
I so fondly remember.

234
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:34,393
Cheryl, no one invited
Fascist Barbie to the party.

235
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:38,188
Wrong, Veronica. No one invited
Southside scum to our school.

236
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,564
Listen up, ragamuffins.

237
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:42,901
I will not allow
Riverdale High's GPA to suffer

238
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:46,113
because of classrooms overcrowded
with underachievers.

239
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:51,034
So, please, find some other school
to debase with your hardscrabble ways.

240
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:53,995
Why don't you come over here
and say that to my face?

241
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,708
- Happily, Queen of the Buskers.
- Okay, guys. Everyone.

242
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,962
Can we put our Northside-Southside
differences apart and start over?

243
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:04,631
- A new slate?
- You don't speak for the Bulldogs.

244
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:09,136
I remind you, these greaser-snakes
showed up at your place to kick your ass.

245
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:10,929
Time to finish
what we started.

246
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:14,516
I am so over the toxic masculinity
in this hallway right now.

247
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,977
All right, enough pomp
and circumstance.

248
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,604
Everyone, let's get to class.
Now.

249
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:27,320
You traitors picked
the wrong side.

250
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:31,074
Nice to see you with Veronica.

251
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:35,787
Especially considering
that clandestine Christmas kiss

252
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:37,497
between you and Betty Cooper.

253
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:40,667
Care to reconsider
your allegiance?

254
00:16:52,138 --> 00:16:52,972
Cheryl.

255
00:16:55,224 --> 00:16:59,854
I was unsurprised and pleased to get your
text suggesting this meeting, Archie.

256
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:01,022
I'll keep it brief.

257
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:05,777
If you don't convince Veronica
to stand against the Southside rabble,

258
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:08,279
I'll tell her
I saw you kissing Betty Cooper.

259
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:11,199
We were broken up,
and so were Jughead and Betty.

260
00:17:12,116 --> 00:17:13,868
That's not why I texted you.

261
00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:17,622
Oh, Archie, do you really think
you're going to outmaneuver me?

262
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:19,332
I want to talk about Nick.

263
00:17:23,169 --> 00:17:24,128
What on earth for?

264
00:17:25,213 --> 00:17:28,424
Did you know that after he left,
he got into an accident?

265
00:17:28,508 --> 00:17:32,553
- Like, a pretty bad car crash?
- Forgive me if I don't shed any tears.

266
00:17:33,304 --> 00:17:36,599
I only wish Mother and I
hadn't burned the check he gave us.

267
00:17:38,976 --> 00:17:41,771
You must've been thrilled, too,
when you found out.

268
00:17:41,854 --> 00:17:44,315
After what Nick did to Veronica
at his party.

269
00:17:44,816 --> 00:17:46,400
- What?
- When he got physical.

270
00:17:47,693 --> 00:17:50,947
- What do you mean?
- I mean, if Veronica hadn't slapped him,

271
00:17:51,322 --> 00:17:55,701
the same thing that happened to me
might have happened to her.

272
00:17:58,204 --> 00:18:00,414
- I am going to murder him.
- Archie...

273
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:05,002
I genuinely thought you knew.

274
00:18:06,546 --> 00:18:09,131
It was Veronica's right
to tell you or not.

275
00:18:10,925 --> 00:18:13,761
I'm sure there's a reason
she kept it from you.

276
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:17,056
Yeah, and I think
I know what it is.

277
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:24,438
As is typical, your brother's files
were made public when he turned 18.

278
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:29,610
His name is Charles Smith.
After your mother gave birth,

279
00:18:29,694 --> 00:18:32,113
he entered, and stayed in,
the foster system.

280
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:35,032
- You mean he wasn't adopted?
- Unfortunately, no.

281
00:18:35,575 --> 00:18:39,287
The last address we have for him
is two towns over, in Centerville.

282
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:45,877
I don't think we've properly met.
Veronica Lodge.

283
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,753
Of the Park Avenue Lodges.

284
00:18:49,297 --> 00:18:50,798
Toni Topaz.

285
00:18:50,882 --> 00:18:54,844
Oh, like the purple-colored gemstone.
Love it.

286
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:59,056
And I'm Josie McCoy,
formerly of the Pussycats.

287
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,267
Now just Josie.

288
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:03,311
And this is Kevin.

289
00:19:05,271 --> 00:19:08,232
- What's your name?
- Fogarty. Or you can call me Fangs.

290
00:19:08,816 --> 00:19:12,111
- Your last name's Keller, right?
- How did you know that?

291
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:15,364
Joaquin and I used to hang out.
He talked about you all the time.

292
00:19:17,283 --> 00:19:19,702
You guys. Yes, you.
Come with me.

293
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:21,495
Now.

294
00:19:33,716 --> 00:19:37,178
Which of you defaced our school
seal with this graffiti?

295
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:42,475
This is what they do,
Principal Weatherbee. They tag their turf.

296
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:44,894
Reggie, could you be
any more transparent?

297
00:19:46,062 --> 00:19:47,521
Effective immediately:

298
00:19:47,605 --> 00:19:50,983
No gang behavior of any kind
will be tolerated in my school.

299
00:19:51,067 --> 00:19:53,778
As of this moment,
no more Serpent jackets.

300
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:55,071
- What?
- You're kidding.

301
00:19:55,154 --> 00:19:58,157
No more Serpent jackets.
All tattoos are gonna be covered.

302
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,037
Possession of any gang paraphernalia
will lead to immediate suspension.

303
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:04,413
Are we clear?

304
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:07,708
That's all.

305
00:20:12,213 --> 00:20:13,547
Mom. Dad.

306
00:20:17,468 --> 00:20:19,095
Polly had the twins.

307
00:20:19,637 --> 00:20:21,722
- What?
- I don't understand.

308
00:20:21,806 --> 00:20:24,934
- She...
- I do. I understand.

309
00:20:25,017 --> 00:20:29,855
She didn't... Doesn't want us
to be a part of the babies' lives.

310
00:20:33,192 --> 00:20:34,402
Isn't that right, Betty?

311
00:20:36,237 --> 00:20:39,115
Well, are they healthy?
Is Polly all right?

312
00:20:39,198 --> 00:20:43,035
Yeah. She is. And they are.

313
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:46,998
Good.

314
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,292
There's something else.

315
00:20:50,835 --> 00:20:53,754
I did some digging,
and I found an address...

316
00:20:55,131 --> 00:20:56,090
for your son,

317
00:20:56,924 --> 00:20:57,925
my brother.

318
00:20:58,801 --> 00:21:03,264
- His name's Charles...
- Betty, what are you talking about?

319
00:21:03,347 --> 00:21:06,475
What? I thought it might help,
now that Polly's...

320
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,937
No.
This has nothing to do with Polly or you.

321
00:21:10,021 --> 00:21:12,898
- Okay, Hal...
- I did it for Mom, Dad.

322
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:16,360
Mom?

323
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,781
Your father's right.

324
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,913
Okay.

325
00:21:28,456 --> 00:21:30,708
I can't believe
you guys don't see it.

326
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,085
Weatherbee is profiling us.

327
00:21:34,587 --> 00:21:39,300
Telling us what to wear. What's next?
Brain implants controlling what we think?

328
00:21:39,383 --> 00:21:41,552
You sound like a conspiracy nut.

329
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:43,846
- A school closed down.
- A crappy school.

330
00:21:44,722 --> 00:21:48,059
Now we're at a better one,
with a computer lab and textbooks.

331
00:21:48,142 --> 00:21:49,602
And toilets that flush.

332
00:21:49,685 --> 00:21:52,730
Getting transferred to
Riverdale High is the best thing.

333
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:53,814
Maybe ever.

334
00:21:53,898 --> 00:21:59,445
If I have to take off my jacket 8:30 to 3,
Monday to Friday, hey, I'm down with that.

335
00:22:06,619 --> 00:22:09,246
My dad soundproofed this,
so I could practice.

336
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:11,248
Get back to it when this is over.

337
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,044
- Said you had something for me?
- Yeah.

338
00:22:16,796 --> 00:22:21,175
Nick was hurt badly in
some accident in Vail,

339
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:22,593
according to the Lodges.

340
00:22:24,345 --> 00:22:26,388
- But it may not be an accident.
- What?

341
00:22:26,472 --> 00:22:29,558
Before I say anything else,
I need assurance from you...

342
00:22:29,642 --> 00:22:33,896
that no matter what happens to Mr. Lodge,
my dad is not gonna go to jail.

343
00:22:34,438 --> 00:22:36,065
I can protect your father.

344
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:40,069
Nick assaulted Veronica.

345
00:22:41,153 --> 00:22:43,823
- If Mr. Lodge found out...
- It'd give him a motive.

346
00:22:43,906 --> 00:22:46,575
Can you get confirmation
from his daughter?

347
00:22:46,659 --> 00:22:50,538
No way, I'm not using Veronica.
But I might be able to get to Nick.

348
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,916
Smart.
He's more likely to talk to you than me.

349
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:57,920
But what if he tells Veronica
I was asking about the accident?

350
00:22:58,003 --> 00:23:00,422
Or tells his parents
and they tell Mr. Lodge?

351
00:23:01,048 --> 00:23:02,508
You need a Trojan horse.

352
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:08,430
A cover story. A reason to see Nick
that has nothing to do with the Lodges.

353
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:14,812
- Can you think of anything?
- Maybe, yeah.

354
00:23:22,695 --> 00:23:23,696
What do you want?

355
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:27,491
I can't stop thinking about what
Nick did to Veronica. And to you.

356
00:23:27,992 --> 00:23:30,286
Do you want another
check from Nick?

357
00:23:30,828 --> 00:23:35,499
I mean, of course I'd take it, but...
I'm afraid the ship's sailed on that one.

358
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:38,794
Really? Because I was thinking of
going to see Nick.

359
00:23:38,878 --> 00:23:41,839
I could ask him for you,
and I bet he'd give it to me.

360
00:23:43,674 --> 00:23:45,551
I need to borrow
one of Jason's blazers.

361
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:56,312
Mom?

362
00:23:59,648 --> 00:24:02,902
We can't tell your father,
because he wouldn't support it...

363
00:24:04,028 --> 00:24:05,738
but I want to see him, Betty.

364
00:24:07,281 --> 00:24:08,490
I want to see my son.

365
00:24:34,726 --> 00:24:36,978
Oh, hey, guys.
What's up?

366
00:24:40,857 --> 00:24:41,858
Take it off.

367
00:24:45,695 --> 00:24:48,823
Take off that jacket, rat boy.

368
00:24:52,827 --> 00:24:56,873
Oh, Reggie, I don't think you know
what this jacket means.

369
00:24:57,791 --> 00:25:00,794
Because you have no sense of honor,
or history or loyalty.

370
00:25:00,877 --> 00:25:02,087
That's it.

371
00:25:05,173 --> 00:25:07,092
- Get him.
- Do it.

372
00:25:09,552 --> 00:25:10,845
Oh, my God.

373
00:25:12,639 --> 00:25:13,848
Mr. Weatherbee.

374
00:25:14,808 --> 00:25:16,810
You all have detention
for fighting.

375
00:25:21,189 --> 00:25:23,733
But I made myself clear
to you, Mr. Jones.

376
00:25:23,817 --> 00:25:26,111
Take off that jacket,
or you're suspended.

377
00:25:26,194 --> 00:25:29,030
- Please, Jughead, just...
- I guess I'm suspended.

378
00:25:44,879 --> 00:25:48,508
Weatherbee told McCoy, who told us,
integration is not going well.

379
00:25:48,591 --> 00:25:54,014
Reggie's just being Reggie,
but he has made gang-wear a flashpoint.

380
00:25:54,556 --> 00:25:57,142
The Southsiders need to
start looking the part.

381
00:25:57,809 --> 00:26:02,772
So, I propose a charitable donation,
to help out the fashionably misguided.

382
00:26:13,783 --> 00:26:14,617
Hi.

383
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:18,621
Forty dollars a night for a single bed,
20 for a bunk.

384
00:26:18,705 --> 00:26:23,209
Oh, we're actually looking for someone.
His name's Charles Smith. Do you know him?

385
00:26:25,336 --> 00:26:26,171
237.

386
00:26:59,245 --> 00:27:00,246
It's okay, Mom.

387
00:27:04,334 --> 00:27:05,168
Come in.

388
00:27:11,466 --> 00:27:13,343
Charles? Charles.

389
00:27:14,594 --> 00:27:15,929
My name's Alice Cooper.

390
00:27:17,472 --> 00:27:18,973
This is my daughter, Betty.

391
00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:24,270
- We're... I'm...
- I know who you are.

392
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,691
The sisters gave me your address
when I turned 18.

393
00:27:29,442 --> 00:27:30,777
When they kicked me out.

394
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:33,863
I even went by your house.

395
00:27:36,741 --> 00:27:38,243
A nice place to grow up.

396
00:27:39,911 --> 00:27:42,664
You didn't want to come in?
Meet us?

397
00:27:43,206 --> 00:27:45,875
You probably didn't want
somebody like me around.

398
00:27:45,959 --> 00:27:49,129
- That's not true.
- You're my sister.

399
00:27:51,631 --> 00:27:55,385
- Yeah. Yes.
- You're lucky she wanted to keep you.

400
00:27:57,053 --> 00:27:58,596
- Charles, I...
- It's Chic.

401
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:02,809
But how would you know that?
You know what? Forget it.

402
00:28:02,892 --> 00:28:04,561
Go. I have a client on the way.

403
00:28:09,858 --> 00:28:11,901
- What work do you do?
- For real?

404
00:28:13,528 --> 00:28:14,696
Fantasy fulfillment.

405
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,198
Now, really. Go.

406
00:28:19,617 --> 00:28:20,451
Come on, Mom.

407
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,865
You break that, you buy it.

408
00:29:01,117 --> 00:29:03,495
- How'd you know I was here?
- Hog Eye called.

409
00:29:03,578 --> 00:29:05,038
- What's up, Hog Eye?
- FP.

410
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:07,874
Explain why you're not in school.

411
00:29:08,416 --> 00:29:12,670
Yes. Weatherbee has been
disrespecting the Serpents.

412
00:29:13,129 --> 00:29:14,756
He's been targeting us.

413
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:16,633
He told us to take off our skins.

414
00:29:16,716 --> 00:29:20,261
You mean your jackets?
Wear them after school.

415
00:29:20,345 --> 00:29:23,264
- A Serpent never sheds his skin.
- I know the laws, boy.

416
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,809
What's going on, Jug?

417
00:29:26,893 --> 00:29:28,853
Really?

418
00:29:32,023 --> 00:29:35,735
At Southside High, we had a place.
Yeah, it was crappy,

419
00:29:35,818 --> 00:29:37,028
but it was ours.

420
00:29:37,111 --> 00:29:39,405
We were a family.
We had a home.

421
00:29:40,657 --> 00:29:41,491
I had a home.

422
00:29:42,367 --> 00:29:43,368
Yeah, I hear you.

423
00:29:45,703 --> 00:29:49,207
But getting arrested for truancy's
not gonna help. Be smart.

424
00:29:50,416 --> 00:29:52,835
Serpents hibernate
during the winter.

425
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:57,882
Look at me. Think I like cleaning toilets?
Shoveling slop? No.

426
00:29:58,591 --> 00:30:00,176
But it's what I gotta do.

427
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:03,513
Going to Riverdale High,
that's what you gotta do.

428
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:09,644
So, lay low for a while,
but you never stop being a Serpent.

429
00:30:20,947 --> 00:30:21,823
Hey, Nick.

430
00:30:22,949 --> 00:30:23,783
Nice dorm room.

431
00:30:26,869 --> 00:30:31,291
What are you doing here?
And why are you wearing that blazer?

432
00:30:34,502 --> 00:30:38,298
You remember Cheryl Blossom?
You wrote her a check covering damages.

433
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,510
Well, that check got lost.
So, you're gonna write it again.

434
00:30:43,595 --> 00:30:45,096
Right now.
For double.

435
00:30:46,389 --> 00:30:48,558
That's it? Money?

436
00:30:50,184 --> 00:30:52,562
Checkbook's in the desk.

437
00:30:58,443 --> 00:31:00,445
You got hurt bad.
How'd that happen?

438
00:31:01,446 --> 00:31:03,448
- Ski accident.
- Ski accident?

439
00:31:04,449 --> 00:31:09,662
Wow. You must really suck at skiing. So,
you wiped out and snapped both your legs?

440
00:31:11,372 --> 00:31:14,292
Yeah, I wiped out on the slopes.
What the hell do you care?

441
00:31:16,961 --> 00:31:20,048
I don't care. I'm just curious.

442
00:31:20,548 --> 00:31:25,261
It's weird. You come to Riverdale,
act like a jackass, try to rape Cheryl,

443
00:31:25,345 --> 00:31:29,432
blow up some deal between the Lodges
and your folks, and skip back to Vail?

444
00:31:29,515 --> 00:31:33,269
For some little ski weekend?
I don't know, that seems weird.

445
00:31:35,521 --> 00:31:37,023
You're not here for Cheryl.

446
00:31:39,192 --> 00:31:40,193
Yes, I am.

447
00:31:41,486 --> 00:31:44,238
I'm here to get what you owe her,
you scumbag.

448
00:31:44,322 --> 00:31:47,158
I don't even remember
you being friends with Cheryl.

449
00:31:47,241 --> 00:31:50,828
- Probably because you were high, Nick.
- Why are you really here?

450
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,414
For Ronnie?

451
00:31:55,583 --> 00:31:59,754
Payback for what you did to Cheryl...
and Veronica.

452
00:31:59,837 --> 00:32:03,049
Payback? No.
No, you know what I think?

453
00:32:04,258 --> 00:32:06,094
I think you're a small-town hick

454
00:32:06,177 --> 00:32:09,931
who's realizing how deep
into shark-infested waters he really is.

455
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:15,978
Careful. When Veronica Lodge smells blood,
she'll turn on you, too.

456
00:32:34,165 --> 00:32:36,417
What the hell? Guys?

457
00:32:39,336 --> 00:32:41,172
Weatherbee gave them to us.

458
00:32:41,505 --> 00:32:44,341
Said he understood that not
every Southside student

459
00:32:44,425 --> 00:32:48,345
had the means to purchase
Riverdale High-acceptable clothes.

460
00:32:49,221 --> 00:32:51,432
He thinks this will
help us fit in.

461
00:32:51,515 --> 00:32:53,642
- Where's Fogarty?
- He wouldn't wear it.

462
00:32:53,726 --> 00:32:55,394
So, they suspended him.

463
00:32:55,478 --> 00:32:58,355
So our choices are
conform or be cast out.

464
00:32:58,439 --> 00:32:59,315
Yeah.

465
00:33:04,945 --> 00:33:10,451
"FYI, your insane boyfriend
just ambushed me in my dorm room.

466
00:33:10,534 --> 00:33:13,746
He broke my nose and
was foaming at the mouth.

467
00:33:13,829 --> 00:33:16,540
- Hope you've had your shots."
- I can explain that.

468
00:33:16,624 --> 00:33:21,337
By all means, Archie, I would love to hear
why you went to New York behind my back

469
00:33:22,046 --> 00:33:24,215
and attacked Nick St. Clair.

470
00:33:24,298 --> 00:33:27,927
I wanted to beat him after what
he did to you after that party.

471
00:33:28,469 --> 00:33:31,430
Who told you about that?
The only people that know

472
00:33:31,514 --> 00:33:34,099
- are me, Nick, and...
- I did.

473
00:33:35,976 --> 00:33:40,064
I told him. I told Archie the truth
about that staph-infection for a human.

474
00:33:41,065 --> 00:33:43,609
And I convinced him
to pay Nick a visit.

475
00:33:43,692 --> 00:33:46,570
- Cheryl, why would you do that?
- Classic shakedown.

476
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:51,242
I wanted money. Archie convinced
Nick reparations were in order.

477
00:33:53,327 --> 00:33:57,581
My only regret is that I betrayed
your confidence, Veronica.

478
00:33:59,124 --> 00:34:01,752
And for that, I'm sorry.

479
00:34:06,006 --> 00:34:06,840
Hey...

480
00:34:09,593 --> 00:34:10,594
I'm sorry, too.

481
00:34:11,554 --> 00:34:12,805
I should've told you.

482
00:34:48,465 --> 00:34:49,300
Hey.

483
00:34:50,676 --> 00:34:51,844
Let go of him.

484
00:34:53,012 --> 00:34:54,972
I said, let go of my brother.

485
00:34:56,515 --> 00:34:57,725
Come on.

486
00:35:06,317 --> 00:35:07,776
Something's off with you.

487
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,194
Huh?

488
00:35:09,278 --> 00:35:12,740
Call it girlfriend's intuition,
but you're hiding something.

489
00:35:15,618 --> 00:35:17,995
I wanted revenge
for what Nick did to you...

490
00:35:18,704 --> 00:35:20,372
That's true, okay?
I swear.

491
00:35:23,876 --> 00:35:26,420
- But there is one thing I left out.
- I knew it.

492
00:35:27,212 --> 00:35:28,172
What?

493
00:35:30,007 --> 00:35:32,676
The reason I visited Nick
in the first place...

494
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:38,265
Cheryl was blackmailing me.

495
00:35:39,183 --> 00:35:40,976
Pardonne-moi, blackmailing you?

496
00:35:41,518 --> 00:35:43,812
- How?
- On the night of the Black Hood...

497
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,065
Cheryl saw...

498
00:35:50,027 --> 00:35:51,612
Cheryl saw me and Betty kiss.

499
00:35:52,529 --> 00:35:55,574
What?
When, why and how?

500
00:35:55,658 --> 00:35:58,369
It was after you dumped me.
Jughead dumped Betty.

501
00:35:58,452 --> 00:36:01,997
Nana Rose told this story about
Betty's grandfather. It happened.

502
00:36:02,081 --> 00:36:05,000
You and Betty... kissed?

503
00:36:05,084 --> 00:36:07,419
It was that crazy night, Ronnie.

504
00:36:07,503 --> 00:36:11,256
Literally 40 minutes later,
the Black Hood was burying me alive.

505
00:36:14,176 --> 00:36:17,721
You and Betty... kissed.

506
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:23,018
We haven't talked about it since.
I don't think we'll ever talk about it.

507
00:36:36,031 --> 00:36:36,865
It's okay.

508
00:36:38,534 --> 00:36:39,743
Do you know why?

509
00:36:39,827 --> 00:36:41,412
Because I believe you.

510
00:36:41,495 --> 00:36:45,332
You're being honest with me.
That's more important than a single...

511
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:48,502
"my life is in danger" kiss.

512
00:36:50,087 --> 00:36:51,463
I love you, Ronnie.

513
00:36:52,923 --> 00:36:54,007
I love you, too.

514
00:37:03,058 --> 00:37:04,601
Mom? Dad?
I need help.

515
00:37:04,685 --> 00:37:06,270
Betty, what happened?

516
00:37:26,875 --> 00:37:30,420
Welcome to the inaugural meeting
of the Swords and Serpents Club.

517
00:37:30,504 --> 00:37:35,509
- Which is what, exactly?
- Like I told Fogarty to lure him back...

518
00:37:35,592 --> 00:37:40,388
We are a gaming group,
sanctioned by Mr. Weatherbee, himself.

519
00:37:40,472 --> 00:37:42,390
Where like-minded
students can meet

520
00:37:42,474 --> 00:37:45,977
and concoct world-building,
role-playing scenarios,

521
00:37:46,061 --> 00:37:51,525
inhabiting fantastical heroes
and dispatching mythological creatures.

522
00:37:51,608 --> 00:37:53,485
No, but really.

523
00:37:53,568 --> 00:37:55,946
It's a club.
For us.

524
00:37:57,489 --> 00:38:02,536
A safe haven where we can be Serpents,
in school hours, under everyone's noses.

525
00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:03,954
We won't shed our skins.

526
00:38:06,957 --> 00:38:09,292
We're lying low,
in the tall grass.

527
00:38:12,504 --> 00:38:14,506
I've solved all our
problems, Mommy.

528
00:38:18,635 --> 00:38:21,388
Blood money from the St. Claire.
And this time,

529
00:38:21,471 --> 00:38:25,141
you have my blessing to deposit it
in a bank, not in the fireplace.

530
00:38:26,935 --> 00:38:30,480
Aren't you glad?
Your days of being a courtesan are over.

531
00:38:31,982 --> 00:38:36,027
Mommy, I said you can stop.

532
00:38:36,903 --> 00:38:38,321
Oh, but Cheryl...

533
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,284
Now, why would I stop...

534
00:38:44,286 --> 00:38:46,538
when I'm having
such a good time?

535
00:38:54,045 --> 00:38:56,548
I know there's a lot to discuss
and sort out.

536
00:38:57,841 --> 00:39:00,051
But for now, try to
get some rest, okay?

537
00:39:07,809 --> 00:39:08,810
Good night, Alice.

538
00:39:09,728 --> 00:39:12,647
- Good night, Hal.
- Good night, Chic.

539
00:39:13,607 --> 00:39:14,691
You'll be safe here.

540
00:39:36,171 --> 00:39:39,966
Why didn't you say anything...
about what happened with you and Nick?

541
00:39:40,842 --> 00:39:42,177
I felt foolish.

542
00:39:44,262 --> 00:39:46,640
For not seeing him for
what he really was.

543
00:39:48,933 --> 00:39:50,852
Did you tell anyone
besides Cheryl?

544
00:39:54,689 --> 00:39:56,524
Kevin, but that's it.

545
00:40:08,536 --> 00:40:10,580
I asked for
protection for my father.

546
00:40:10,664 --> 00:40:15,210
I want it for Veronica, too.
I don't want her hurt or in trouble.

547
00:40:15,293 --> 00:40:18,880
Help us, and she
and your father are both off-limits.

548
00:40:18,963 --> 00:40:20,882
- Protected.
- I want that in writing.

549
00:40:20,965 --> 00:40:22,050
Absolutely.

550
00:40:22,133 --> 00:40:25,136
You can't get emotional again,
like you did with Nick.

551
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:28,056
- You get emotional, you get sloppy.
- One more thing.

552
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,811
If you've followed me around,
you must know about the Black Hood.

553
00:40:33,353 --> 00:40:35,021
I do. Nice job.

554
00:40:35,522 --> 00:40:40,777
In your expert opinion, Agent Adams,
do you think we got the right guy?

555
00:40:42,904 --> 00:40:44,948
I haven't told anyone
about this...

556
00:40:46,574 --> 00:40:48,159
but I'm not so sure we did.

557
00:40:50,328 --> 00:40:54,207
And so, Archie,
always trying to do the good, noble thing,

558
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:56,835
took another step
further into darkness.

559
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,931
And Betty, the girl next door,

560
00:41:10,014 --> 00:41:12,392
had no sooner vanquished
one monster...

561
00:41:26,114 --> 00:41:29,701
than she'd perhaps let another one
into her family's lives.
