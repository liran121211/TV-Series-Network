1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,752
Previously on Riverdale...

2
00:00:07,758 --> 00:00:10,236
No, no. Don't come any
closer. Don't touch anything.

3
00:00:10,238 --> 00:00:12,672
- It was self-defense, right?
- Yes, of course it was.

4
00:00:12,675 --> 00:00:14,040
You lied to us.

5
00:00:14,042 --> 00:00:16,609
That shady guy was a drug dealer.

6
00:00:16,611 --> 00:00:18,544
What else is he lying about, huh?

7
00:00:18,546 --> 00:00:20,380
What do Sunnyside Trailer park,

8
00:00:20,382 --> 00:00:22,649
Twilight Drive-In and Southside High

9
00:00:22,651 --> 00:00:23,750
all have in common?

10
00:00:23,752 --> 00:00:25,285
You control them.

11
00:00:25,288 --> 00:00:27,587
Now the trailer park is in jeopjedy.

12
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:30,516
Can't you just feel the invisible
hand of Hiram Lodge all over this?

13
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:31,913
You've got a lot of nervous people

14
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,426
scared they're gonna lose their home.

15
00:00:33,428 --> 00:00:34,493
As a gesture of goodwill,

16
00:00:34,496 --> 00:00:37,688
I'd like to settle any back rent
you or your neighbors owe the town.

17
00:00:37,691 --> 00:00:38,857
It's a deal.

18
00:00:40,321 --> 00:00:41,516
There is one thing.

19
00:00:41,519 --> 00:00:43,002
Mayor McCoy tells me
there's some kind of

20
00:00:43,004 --> 00:00:44,337
expose you're working on, Jughead.

21
00:00:44,339 --> 00:00:46,339
I'd appreciate it if you
just kept my name out of it.

22
00:00:46,341 --> 00:00:48,474
That sounds a lot like a bribe.

23
00:00:48,476 --> 00:00:50,216
No deal.

24
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:52,493
See you in the funny pages.

25
00:00:53,815 --> 00:00:56,349
Picture a girl, living
in the house next door.

26
00:00:56,351 --> 00:00:58,349
Give her a ponytail and a secret.

27
00:00:58,352 --> 00:00:59,685
Day after day,

28
00:00:59,688 --> 00:01:02,522
she checks the headlines
and watches the local news,

29
00:01:02,524 --> 00:01:04,324
waiting to be exposed.

30
00:01:10,045 --> 00:01:12,198
Chic, what's wrong with your bathroom?

31
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,599
You have better water pressure.

32
00:01:13,601 --> 00:01:15,138
Tough. Use your own.

33
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:18,504
And bit by bit, the walls close in,

34
00:01:18,506 --> 00:01:21,240
until what was once just a house

35
00:01:21,242 --> 00:01:24,091
becomes her own private purgatory.

36
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,913
Still at it, Mother?

37
00:01:26,915 --> 00:01:29,682
I thought you'd be tired of
taking filthy wads of cash

38
00:01:29,684 --> 00:01:31,184
from strangers by now.

39
00:01:32,687 --> 00:01:35,088
You have no right

40
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:36,856
to judge me.

41
00:01:36,858 --> 00:01:40,834
Not when you drove away the one
decent chance I had at a better life.

42
00:01:40,837 --> 00:01:42,474
You mean with Hal Cooper?

43
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,784
If that's your idea of love.

44
00:01:44,787 --> 00:01:46,699
What would you know about it?

45
00:01:46,701 --> 00:01:48,801
You've never known love, Cheryl,

46
00:01:48,803 --> 00:01:50,536
except to rip it apart.

47
00:01:50,538 --> 00:01:52,538
Because you are a jealous,

48
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:57,710
spite-filled, starving,
emotional anorexic.

49
00:01:59,381 --> 00:02:01,380
Have a nice day at school, dear.

50
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,687
Ah, I'm glad I caught you both.

51
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:10,523
Mrs. Lodge and I were headed up
to the lake house this weekend,

52
00:02:10,525 --> 00:02:13,126
but it looks like we're going
to cancel due to some business.

53
00:02:13,129 --> 00:02:15,628
So why don't you kids go instead?

54
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,131
You know, make a
little romantic getaway.

55
00:02:18,133 --> 00:02:20,357
- Wow, thank you, Mr. Lodge.
- That'd be amazing, Daddy.

56
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,059
Andre can drive you up and stay nearby,

57
00:02:22,062 --> 00:02:23,536
in case you want to go into town.

58
00:02:23,538 --> 00:02:24,724
No! No chaperones.

59
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:27,339
Andre can drop us off, and
pick us up on Sunday night,

60
00:02:27,342 --> 00:02:29,399
we don't need one of
your spies shadowing us.

61
00:02:29,402 --> 00:02:30,818
Fine, mija.

62
00:02:30,821 --> 00:02:32,612
Hey, why don't you
invite Betty and Jughead?

63
00:02:32,614 --> 00:02:34,029
Make a real weekend out of it.

64
00:02:34,032 --> 00:02:35,237
That'd be great.

65
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,151
Hey, before you head off,
can I have a word in private?

66
00:02:38,153 --> 00:02:39,419
Yeah.

67
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,680
Hey. Just an FYI.

68
00:02:43,683 --> 00:02:45,149
While you're at the lake,

69
00:02:45,152 --> 00:02:47,793
Mrs. Lodge and I will be hosting
a meeting here at the Pembrooke,

70
00:02:47,796 --> 00:02:49,854
with the major New York families.

71
00:02:49,857 --> 00:02:51,597
Is everything okay?

72
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,685
There's been some unrest

73
00:02:54,688 --> 00:02:56,569
since Poppa Poutine's death,

74
00:02:56,571 --> 00:02:58,905
and I'd prefer Veronica
safely out of town.

75
00:02:58,908 --> 00:03:02,865
That cabin at Shadow Lake is
a sort of safe house for us.

76
00:03:02,868 --> 00:03:05,545
I'll make sure Veronica's
protected, Mr. Lodge.

77
00:03:05,548 --> 00:03:06,841
I'm sure you will.

78
00:03:06,844 --> 00:03:09,084
But despite my daughter's wishes,

79
00:03:09,087 --> 00:03:12,351
Andre will be there, unseen but nearby.

80
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:16,396
I hope I can trust you
to keep that between us.

81
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:18,224
You know, man to man.

82
00:03:19,982 --> 00:03:22,383
I was checking out a few places.

83
00:03:22,386 --> 00:03:25,349
There's that one building
on Franklin and Sycamore.

84
00:03:25,352 --> 00:03:27,519
Dad, there's living on the
wrong side of the tracks

85
00:03:27,522 --> 00:03:29,668
and then there's living
directly over the tracks.

86
00:03:29,671 --> 00:03:31,552
I'm a soda jerk at Pop's, Jughead.

87
00:03:31,555 --> 00:03:33,371
We're not gonna be
moving into the Pembrooke.

88
00:03:33,374 --> 00:03:34,707
Well we shouldn't have to move at all.

89
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:36,809
No one in this trailer
park should have to move.

90
00:03:36,811 --> 00:03:39,345
This is just Hiram Lodge's
vendetta against us.

91
00:03:39,348 --> 00:03:41,380
Look, he is planning something, Dad,

92
00:03:41,383 --> 00:03:43,998
something big and bad. I just...

93
00:03:44,001 --> 00:03:45,990
I just have to figure
out a different angle.

94
00:03:52,509 --> 00:03:53,641
Hey, Moose.

95
00:03:53,644 --> 00:03:55,411
Hey, there's this new movie,

96
00:03:55,414 --> 00:03:57,463
Love, Simon, playing at
the Bijou this weekend.

97
00:03:57,465 --> 00:04:00,099
It's a John Hughesian coming-of-age,

98
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:01,167
coming-out movie.

99
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:02,896
Yeah, no, I'm already going.

100
00:04:02,899 --> 00:04:04,393
With Midge.

101
00:04:04,396 --> 00:04:06,506
You can come with us, if
you want. She wouldn't mind.

102
00:04:06,508 --> 00:04:08,995
Really? Midge is that open-minded?

103
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,810
Yeah, she knows all about us.

104
00:04:10,812 --> 00:04:12,776
I told her, she's cool with it.

105
00:04:12,779 --> 00:04:14,514
Cool, right, yeah.

106
00:04:14,516 --> 00:04:16,382
You know what? I think I'm gonna pass.

107
00:04:16,384 --> 00:04:18,151
It's all a little too Big Love for me.

108
00:04:20,974 --> 00:04:22,155
Fair warning.

109
00:04:22,157 --> 00:04:24,557
Our Shadow Lake chalet is rustic,

110
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:28,194
but it has breath-taking views
of the mountains, the water...

111
00:04:28,196 --> 00:04:30,951
Oh, my God. That sounds heavenly, Vee.

112
00:04:30,954 --> 00:04:32,998
What do you say, Jug?

113
00:04:33,001 --> 00:04:34,401
Can you bear it?

114
00:04:37,005 --> 00:04:38,627
As long as it's cool with your dad.

115
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,774
- Mr. Lodge actually suggested it.
- Yeah.

116
00:04:40,777 --> 00:04:43,176
Well, then, cue the dueling banjos.

117
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,880
What?

118
00:04:45,883 --> 00:04:48,248
And it'll also be a good chance
for me to work on my novel.

119
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:49,435
Excellent!

120
00:04:49,438 --> 00:04:53,505
But remember, the point of this
luxury weekend is to relax and unplug.

121
00:04:53,508 --> 00:04:55,587
"Luxury" and "weekend",

122
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,093
two of my favorite words.

123
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:58,976
So, where are we going,

124
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:00,893
and how extravagant a
wardrobe should I pack?

125
00:05:00,895 --> 00:05:06,265
Sorry, Cheryl. It's kind of a
romantic, couples-only weekend.

126
00:05:08,136 --> 00:05:09,502
I see.

127
00:05:09,504 --> 00:05:10,670
Of course.

128
00:05:10,672 --> 00:05:11,771
My mistake.

129
00:05:11,773 --> 00:05:14,508
Well, have fun with your romances.

130
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,716
What's up?

131
00:05:23,718 --> 00:05:26,285
Babe, don't get me wrong,
I'm thrilled you're up

132
00:05:26,287 --> 00:05:28,354
for this weekend away,

133
00:05:28,357 --> 00:05:31,090
but why am I also slightly suspicious?

134
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,694
Possibly because I need
a new source of intel

135
00:05:34,696 --> 00:05:36,362
for my article on Hiram Lodge,

136
00:05:36,364 --> 00:05:39,031
and I was just thinking
that could be Veronica.

137
00:05:40,369 --> 00:05:42,801
She's on the inside of her
family business. Maybe I can...

138
00:05:42,804 --> 00:05:45,838
Okay, one... Can you please
not investigate my best friend

139
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,008
when she's nice enough to invite
us both to her family's cabin?

140
00:05:49,011 --> 00:05:51,978
And two... Ever since
that night, it's like...

141
00:05:53,548 --> 00:05:56,864
Chic is everywhere.

142
00:05:56,867 --> 00:06:01,120
I need this weekend to be an escape.

143
00:06:01,123 --> 00:06:03,111
All Alght.

144
00:06:03,114 --> 00:06:05,925
Solemnly promise I'll behave myself.

145
00:06:13,001 --> 00:06:14,967
Be down in a second, Jug.

146
00:06:22,895 --> 00:06:24,410
You must be Chic.

147
00:06:24,413 --> 00:06:26,192
You're Betty's boyfriend.

148
00:06:26,195 --> 00:06:27,955
Guilty.

149
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:30,149
Um, yes.

150
00:06:30,151 --> 00:06:31,550
Nice shirt.

151
00:06:31,552 --> 00:06:32,752
You work at the Bijou?

152
00:06:32,754 --> 00:06:34,287
You know what happened here?

153
00:06:36,324 --> 00:06:37,890
Don't worry. I'm someone you can trust.

154
00:06:37,892 --> 00:06:39,723
If you tell anyone,

155
00:06:39,726 --> 00:06:42,394
it'll be bad for Betty and Alice.

156
00:06:42,397 --> 00:06:44,637
What?

157
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,999
Ready. Let's go.

158
00:06:47,002 --> 00:06:48,268
See ya, Chic.

159
00:07:20,158 --> 00:07:22,191
When I was younger, we'd
come here every summer,

160
00:07:22,194 --> 00:07:24,628
whenever my dad could
sneak away for a weekend.

161
00:07:29,947 --> 00:07:32,236
Veronica wasn't kidding.

162
00:07:32,239 --> 00:07:34,847
It really was the
last house on the left.

163
00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:36,515
I'll help you with the bags.

164
00:07:36,517 --> 00:07:38,262
No, no, we've got it. Archie?

165
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,215
TTFN, Andre.

166
00:07:44,218 --> 00:07:48,087
We'll see you Sunday night at 7:00
p.m., and not a second earlier.

167
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,918
Betty, wait till you see the inside.

168
00:07:53,903 --> 00:07:55,512
I'm sure Mr. Lodge explained

169
00:07:55,515 --> 00:07:58,182
if there's any trouble, I'm
a phone call away, all right?

170
00:08:22,361 --> 00:08:25,195
Welcome to what I humbly like to call,

171
00:08:25,198 --> 00:08:26,432
"Lodge Lodge."

172
00:08:33,565 --> 00:08:34,575
Hello?

173
00:08:34,578 --> 00:08:35,841
How's the lake house?

174
00:08:35,843 --> 00:08:38,375
Are you all settled in and spooning yet?

175
00:08:38,378 --> 00:08:41,729
- Who is this?
- It's Cheryl, you welfare baby.

176
00:08:41,732 --> 00:08:43,048
Something wrong?

177
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:44,697
Not yet.

178
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,459
I just wanna make sure you know that

179
00:08:46,462 --> 00:08:49,145
Archie and Betty kissed in front
of my house right before Christmas,

180
00:08:49,148 --> 00:08:50,622
and that it seemed pretty serious.

181
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,598
Like, with-tongues serious.

182
00:08:52,601 --> 00:08:53,598
That's all.

183
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:55,918
Enjoy your couples-only
weekend. Kisses to all, bye now.

184
00:08:59,934 --> 00:09:03,202
Jug? What happened? Are you okay?

185
00:09:03,205 --> 00:09:05,283
That was Cheryl.

186
00:09:05,286 --> 00:09:08,220
She said you and Archie
kissed in front of her house.

188
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:20,656
That's all. Enjoy your couples-only
weekend. Kisses to all, bye now.

189
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:28,247
Did you just tell Jughead
that Archie and Betty kissed?

190
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,434
Yes. So what if I did?

191
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:32,778
Did you at least have a reason?

192
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:35,375
Oh, that's right... You're new here.

193
00:09:35,378 --> 00:09:37,661
Hi. I'm Cheryl Blossom,

194
00:09:37,664 --> 00:09:39,466
AKA Cherry Bombshell,

195
00:09:39,469 --> 00:09:41,508
which means I need no reasons.

196
00:09:41,511 --> 00:09:43,773
I simply am.

197
00:09:43,776 --> 00:09:45,781
Feel free to tremble.

198
00:09:45,784 --> 00:09:46,910
I have a better idea.

199
00:09:46,913 --> 00:09:48,686
Why don't you tell me
what's bothering you?

200
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:51,889
Because clearly you're in a lot of pain.

201
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:56,994
Get your Sapphic,
serpent hands off my body!

202
00:10:03,738 --> 00:10:05,671
You think they're gonna break up?

203
00:10:05,674 --> 00:10:08,005
That would be, like, the
twelfth time this year.

204
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,090
We didn't break up over it.

205
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:20,458
Archie...

206
00:10:20,461 --> 00:10:21,894
That kiss...

207
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:29,160
That's for telling me
about it when you did.

208
00:10:29,163 --> 00:10:30,996
For trusting me.

209
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,329
Shows how strong we are together.

210
00:10:35,332 --> 00:10:38,703
- Ronnie...
- Us against the world.

211
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,707
Do you want the top or bottom drawer?

212
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:00,324
Jug, can we please
talk about this already?

213
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:06,493
Betty, I'm not mad about the kiss.

214
00:11:06,496 --> 00:11:10,253
But I am wondering why you didn't
tell me when I told you about Toni.

215
00:11:11,558 --> 00:11:13,258
I wanted to tell you.

216
00:11:13,261 --> 00:11:16,559
Is it because you think
Archie's my third rail?

217
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,044
Okay.

218
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:22,580
Yes.

219
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:26,621
I mean, you guys grew
up next to each other.

220
00:11:26,624 --> 00:11:29,324
Your bedroom windows
literally face one another.

221
00:11:29,327 --> 00:11:30,973
That used to bother me,

222
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:36,306
but after everything we've
been through, recently,

223
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:39,830
I'm not intimidated by a
Black Hood-prompted kiss.

224
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,684
Okay.

225
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,931
Oh, my God!

226
00:11:49,934 --> 00:11:51,442
Are they serious?

227
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,407
Is that their response to everything?

228
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,980
Can't they ever just
have, like, a conversation?

229
00:12:02,074 --> 00:12:03,798
Hi, guys.

230
00:12:03,801 --> 00:12:05,456
- Hey.
- Hi.

231
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:07,809
Relax.

232
00:12:07,812 --> 00:12:09,215
Everything's fine.

233
00:12:11,256 --> 00:12:12,622
Awesome.

234
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:15,887
Because you guys haven't
tried my jalapeno margaritas.

235
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,418
Who wants one?

236
00:12:18,469 --> 00:12:20,670
I'd like to propose a toast.

237
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:21,872
To the Lodges,

238
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,110
to their hospitality.

239
00:12:23,113 --> 00:12:24,605
And to putting the past behind us.

240
00:12:24,608 --> 00:12:25,576
Cheers!

241
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,178
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

242
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:33,751
So, your parents come up here
a lot these days, Veronica?

243
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,519
Not as much as they'd like.

244
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,571
Daddy's such a workaholic, you know.

245
00:12:37,574 --> 00:12:39,184
On the SoDale project?

246
00:12:39,187 --> 00:12:40,729
How's that going? Is that heating up?

247
00:12:40,732 --> 00:12:42,565
- Still getting intense?
- It is.

248
00:12:42,568 --> 00:12:44,461
Luckily, Archie's dad is doing

249
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,697
such a superb job of keeping
engrything on schedule.

250
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:49,676
Vee, tell us more about
your fancy neighbors.

251
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:51,743
Yeah, are they in the
same business as your dad?

252
00:12:51,746 --> 00:12:54,743
- Jughead! I mean it.
- Guys, what's up?

253
00:12:54,746 --> 00:12:58,075
Betty, I'm just making
idle conversation.

254
00:12:58,078 --> 00:12:59,551
I'm sorry, please continue.

255
00:12:59,554 --> 00:13:02,278
It's a hodgepodge, really.
Some are in entertainment,

256
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,949
some are in business,
some are in real estate.

257
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:06,317
You know what's weird?

258
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:07,852
As we were driving up
here, I noticed that

259
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:10,521
none of the houses had mailboxes
or numbers or anything on 'em...

260
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:11,622
Why is that?

261
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,424
Shadow Lake is a pretty
private community.

262
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:14,592
Like they're hiding something?

263
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:17,561
Jughead, seriously,
this isn't 20 Questions.

264
00:13:19,606 --> 00:13:21,072
Toxic twin alert.

265
00:13:21,075 --> 00:13:23,776
I knew things weren't kosher
in the state of Bughead.

266
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,871
Guys...

267
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:30,274
I'm picking up some residual tension

268
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:33,244
from, I'm guessing, Cheryl's
Random Act of Cruelty earlier.

269
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:34,845
- What? No.
- Uh, no.

270
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,881
Which is understandable.

271
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:39,548
Fear you not though, I
have just the antidote.

272
00:13:39,551 --> 00:13:44,113
Step one. Clothes off, swimsuits on.

273
00:14:00,793 --> 00:14:02,759
Ah. I don't know about you guys,

274
00:14:02,762 --> 00:14:05,113
but I'm feeling better already.

275
00:14:05,116 --> 00:14:07,684
Okay, so,

276
00:14:07,687 --> 00:14:09,488
full disclosure time.

277
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,884
When Archie told me about the kiss,

278
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:16,399
I absorbed it, processed it,

279
00:14:16,402 --> 00:14:20,391
and in the end, I bear no ill
will towards my beau nor my bestie.

280
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:24,762
But has the thought of it
haunted me these last few weeks?

281
00:14:24,765 --> 00:14:26,355
A tiny bit, yeah.

282
00:14:27,738 --> 00:14:29,506
And now, clearly, Betty and Jughead,

283
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:31,431
you guys are caught up in the aftermath.

284
00:14:31,434 --> 00:14:34,605
So to clear the air amongst us,

285
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:36,770
Jughead and I

286
00:14:36,773 --> 00:14:38,173
should kiss.

287
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:40,738
What?

288
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:43,447
Veronica, are you nuts?

289
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,316
Well, wait a minute, I don't know.

290
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:46,383
Hold on.

291
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,621
Veronica and I kissing
might help to, uh...

292
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,715
What's the sports term, Archie?

293
00:14:53,718 --> 00:14:55,893
Uh... Level the playing field?

294
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,294
Betty, a little help here?

295
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:59,096
- You're not upset though?
- No.

296
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:00,698
No, really, I'm not upset.

297
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,259
- Right.
- But I'm human.

298
00:15:03,262 --> 00:15:05,420
What if a future me tries to use your

299
00:15:05,423 --> 00:15:08,113
kiss with Archie
against some future you?

300
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:10,507
A Vughead kiss, right
now, in the present

301
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:12,634
might be precisely what it takes to

302
00:15:12,637 --> 00:15:14,880
save a future Bughead from imploding.

303
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,707
Archie, come on, man.
It's just a stupid kiss.

304
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,109
Right?

305
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,180
Jughead.

306
00:15:26,183 --> 00:15:27,458
Don't freak out.

307
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:30,995
Just trust me.

308
00:15:49,979 --> 00:15:52,377
Huh. You know what I just realized?

309
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,616
Out of the four of us, only
you and Archie haven't kissed.

310
00:15:55,618 --> 00:15:56,784
Fascinating.

311
00:15:57,881 --> 00:16:01,283
Wait... What? You and Veronica?

312
00:16:08,006 --> 00:16:09,739
Did it make you feel better?

313
00:16:09,742 --> 00:16:11,241
Kissing Veronica?

314
00:16:13,564 --> 00:16:16,846
It felt good watching Archie's face.

315
00:16:16,849 --> 00:16:20,182
Okay, but did you enjoy kissing her?

316
00:16:20,185 --> 00:16:22,658
I know entrapment when I hear it, Betty.

317
00:16:24,848 --> 00:16:26,822
Because if you did,

318
00:16:26,825 --> 00:16:29,830
I might have to punish you.

319
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,619
How?

320
00:16:34,251 --> 00:16:36,919
I packed this

321
00:16:36,922 --> 00:16:39,733
in case you needed a distraction

322
00:16:39,736 --> 00:16:41,916
from your sleuthing.

323
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:47,135
Consider me distracted.

324
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:55,741
Don't get me wrong, I
love a good floor show.

325
00:16:55,744 --> 00:16:57,577
But if this is your response to Jughead

326
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,480
threatening your
masculinity or whatever...

327
00:16:59,483 --> 00:17:01,582
I'm just getting my daily workout in.

328
00:17:04,787 --> 00:17:06,554
Well...

329
00:17:07,824 --> 00:17:11,192
There are other ways to do that.

330
00:17:12,562 --> 00:17:14,762
I'm actually kinda tired, Ronnie.

331
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:17,798
You're kidding, right?

332
00:17:20,837 --> 00:17:22,637
Oh, my God!

333
00:17:24,407 --> 00:17:25,773
Are they...

334
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:18,526
- Veronica...
- What the hell is going on here?

335
00:18:18,528 --> 00:18:20,194
Your father asked me to stay on...

336
00:18:20,196 --> 00:18:21,166
Why?

337
00:18:21,169 --> 00:18:23,029
Your dad's doing business
back in Riverdale.

338
00:18:23,032 --> 00:18:25,266
He's hosting a meeting
of the other families

339
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:27,067
and he just wanted to make sure we...

340
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,536
You... Would be safe.

341
00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:30,064
Wait, you knew?

342
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,206
Well, here's what's going to happen.

343
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,842
You're gonna call my dad, and
tell him that your cover's blown

344
00:18:34,844 --> 00:18:36,779
because you're a horrible spy.

345
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,949
And then you're leaving, immediately.

346
00:18:40,338 --> 00:18:41,689
Go!

347
00:18:48,808 --> 00:18:51,470
Veronica, I don't think it's such a
great idea to just send Andre away.

348
00:18:51,472 --> 00:18:53,072
No, Archie.

349
00:18:53,075 --> 00:18:55,900
You need to give me some space, okay?

350
00:18:55,903 --> 00:18:58,226
I'm getting Betty, and
we're going into town,

351
00:18:58,229 --> 00:18:59,652
alone, just us girls,

352
00:18:59,655 --> 00:19:01,775
and you can stay here
and entertain Jughead.

353
00:19:01,778 --> 00:19:04,498
Oh, and try not to choke on your
own testosterone while you're at it.

354
00:19:09,946 --> 00:19:12,330
Mom...

355
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,111
Hey, Josie!

356
00:19:14,114 --> 00:19:16,116
Tom and I were just discussing

357
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:19,319
the new security system we're
installing at the law firm.

358
00:19:19,322 --> 00:19:22,990
Yeah, well you two do enjoy
working together, so...

359
00:19:24,093 --> 00:19:26,374
- Well, I should probably get back to the station.
- Okay.

360
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,832
Josie...

361
00:19:33,101 --> 00:19:34,734
We talked about this.

362
00:19:34,737 --> 00:19:36,796
Tom and I care about each other.

363
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,155
I know. It's just...

364
00:19:39,158 --> 00:19:40,726
It's weird

365
00:19:40,729 --> 00:19:43,666
to see him here with you like that.

366
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:45,916
Especially when Dad doesn't know.

367
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,522
Josie,

368
00:19:48,525 --> 00:19:50,418
he does know.

369
00:19:50,421 --> 00:19:51,952
I told him.

370
00:19:51,955 --> 00:19:54,700
We were going to wait til
after you graduated, but...

371
00:19:54,703 --> 00:19:56,036
Are you...

372
00:19:57,356 --> 00:19:59,022
Are you getting a divorce?

373
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:02,744
Because of Sheriff Keller?

374
00:20:02,747 --> 00:20:04,528
Is he getting a divorce, too?

375
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:06,263
He hasn't talked to his wife yet.

376
00:20:06,265 --> 00:20:08,986
She's still overseas.
Or Kevin. But, Josie,

377
00:20:08,989 --> 00:20:11,034
we have to respect that.

378
00:20:12,433 --> 00:20:13,666
Respect?

379
00:20:21,613 --> 00:20:23,747
Did you know that Betty
and Veronica kissed?

380
00:20:25,417 --> 00:20:27,486
What? What are you talking about?

381
00:20:27,489 --> 00:20:30,053
Apparently, first week of school.

382
00:20:30,055 --> 00:20:32,022
During cheerleading try-outs.

383
00:20:32,024 --> 00:20:33,807
Bee and Vee kissed.

384
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,799
- Really?
- Yeah.

385
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:37,127
Why?

386
00:20:37,129 --> 00:20:38,995
I couldn't tell you.

387
00:20:38,998 --> 00:20:40,797
Betty tried explaining it last night,

388
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,532
but the rationale still eludes me.

389
00:20:46,305 --> 00:20:47,760
Jug...

390
00:20:47,763 --> 00:20:49,814
About me kissing Betty...

391
00:20:49,817 --> 00:20:52,186
There's really no good excuse.

392
00:20:52,189 --> 00:20:54,144
I'm sorry.

393
00:20:55,579 --> 00:20:56,945
That's okay.

394
00:20:56,948 --> 00:20:58,748
Admittedly, this is all

395
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,283
way more complicated than
any of us could have planned.

396
00:21:01,286 --> 00:21:02,385
What is?

397
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:03,753
Take you and me, for example.

398
00:21:03,755 --> 00:21:05,222
I'm your best guy friend, right?

399
00:21:05,224 --> 00:21:06,990
And Betty is your best girl friend.

400
00:21:06,992 --> 00:21:08,955
So your best friends are dating.

401
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:11,427
But Bee and Vee are also best friends.

402
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:15,510
So, your best friend's girlfriend is
also your girlfriend's best friend.

403
00:21:15,513 --> 00:21:17,205
You understand what I'm trying to say?

404
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:19,174
Uh, no, not really.

405
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:21,538
It should be amazing
that we're all so close.

406
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,835
But sometimes it terrifies me.

407
00:21:25,478 --> 00:21:28,593
It's like the four of
us are in a powder keg.

408
00:21:28,596 --> 00:21:31,481
All it would take is one
match, and we'd all blow up.

409
00:21:37,876 --> 00:21:39,543
Great toss, Archie.

410
00:21:40,911 --> 00:21:43,275
I'm so glad you called, Josie.

411
00:21:43,278 --> 00:21:46,363
I was just thinking about this
year's musical, which I'm directing.

412
00:21:46,365 --> 00:21:49,766
And I want it to be a
star vehicle for you.

413
00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:51,501
You might not want that

414
00:21:51,503 --> 00:21:53,846
after I tell you why I called.

415
00:21:53,849 --> 00:21:56,197
Hey, buddy, what're you doing here?

416
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,611
You and Josie's mom. Is that true?

417
00:21:58,614 --> 00:22:00,572
Okay, well, what have you heard?

418
00:22:00,575 --> 00:22:01,711
So it is true.

419
00:22:01,714 --> 00:22:03,846
Mom is risking her
life every single day,

420
00:22:03,849 --> 00:22:06,046
and you're here running
around with your boss.

421
00:22:06,049 --> 00:22:07,417
Former boss.

422
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,953
God, I spent my whole life

423
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:11,475
trying to live up to your standards...

424
00:22:11,478 --> 00:22:13,624
- Kevin...
- But it's all bull crap!

425
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:19,205
So, Betty...

426
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:22,072
Unless that was some seriously
aggressive hand-holding

427
00:22:22,075 --> 00:22:23,546
I heard through the wall last night...

428
00:22:24,636 --> 00:22:26,150
When did that start?

429
00:22:27,606 --> 00:22:30,206
The night of your confirmation.

430
00:22:30,209 --> 00:22:32,075
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

431
00:22:32,077 --> 00:22:33,877
Well,

432
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,653
as my abuelita likes to say,

433
00:22:35,656 --> 00:22:37,289
"Praise Jesus."

434
00:22:37,292 --> 00:22:40,029
Hi, I'd like this

435
00:22:40,032 --> 00:22:42,315
and this.

436
00:22:42,318 --> 00:22:44,487
And, oh, the last time I was here,

437
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:46,356
you had the most scrumptious scones.

438
00:22:46,358 --> 00:22:49,426
Yeah. Yeah, my grandma makes
'em, but just during the summer

439
00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:50,827
for the summer people.

440
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:53,213
Oh. That's when we normally come up.

441
00:22:53,216 --> 00:22:55,065
Thought I recognized you.

442
00:22:55,068 --> 00:22:57,334
You've got one of those
places on Shadow Lake, right?

443
00:22:57,337 --> 00:22:59,168
But you're usually with your folks.

444
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:01,338
Yeah, they're back in, um...

445
00:23:01,341 --> 00:23:04,174
I was about to say New York,
but we're in Riverdale now.

446
00:23:04,176 --> 00:23:05,669
That hick town?

447
00:23:05,672 --> 00:23:07,818
I bet they don't even know
what to do with you there.

448
00:23:07,821 --> 00:23:09,420
No, they do not.

449
00:23:09,423 --> 00:23:11,123
What's your name, handsome?

450
00:23:11,126 --> 00:23:12,882
Okay, enough flirting here.

451
00:23:12,884 --> 00:23:15,165
You had a fight with Archie,
you didn't break up with him.

452
00:23:16,184 --> 00:23:17,617
I'm Cassidy.

453
00:23:25,794 --> 00:23:28,965
So, how's it been? You
know, with you and Jughead?

454
00:23:28,968 --> 00:23:31,512
Oh. Things have been nice.

455
00:23:31,515 --> 00:23:33,036
"Nice"?

456
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:35,071
Nice is not what I heard last night.

457
00:23:35,073 --> 00:23:37,507
Okay, well, you know
what I wore that night

458
00:23:37,509 --> 00:23:39,909
we got Chuck into that hot tub?

459
00:23:39,912 --> 00:23:42,246
Betty, what?

460
00:23:45,114 --> 00:23:46,514
Hi.

461
00:23:46,517 --> 00:23:47,916
- Hey.
- Hey.

462
00:23:54,382 --> 00:23:56,115
Are you still mad at me?

463
00:23:56,118 --> 00:23:57,627
Yes.

464
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:01,865
But you can make it up to
me by remembering one thing.

465
00:24:01,867 --> 00:24:05,004
And it's simple and non-negotiable.

466
00:24:05,007 --> 00:24:08,121
From now on, it's me and you,

467
00:24:08,124 --> 00:24:10,658
not you and my dad, okay?

468
00:24:16,457 --> 00:24:19,792
If that's Cheryl, tell her everyone
kissed everyone and it's over.

469
00:24:19,795 --> 00:24:21,227
It's my dad.

470
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:23,553
Hey, Dad, what's up?

471
00:24:23,555 --> 00:24:25,989
Jughead! Jughead, hey,
you're not gonna believe it.

472
00:24:25,991 --> 00:24:28,504
Uh, hold on, I can't really
hear you. Hold on a sec.

473
00:24:28,507 --> 00:24:30,410
Yeah, everyone's over here celebrating!

474
00:24:30,413 --> 00:24:34,396
Listen, the eviction notices,
the back rent... It's all gone!

475
00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:36,166
Paid in full! No one has to move out!

476
00:24:36,168 --> 00:24:37,801
That's amazing! How did this happen?

477
00:24:37,803 --> 00:24:39,869
You! You shamed him into it.

478
00:24:39,871 --> 00:24:41,938
He did a complete 180.

479
00:24:41,941 --> 00:24:43,707
Who did? What are you talking about?

480
00:24:43,709 --> 00:24:45,709
Hiram... Hiram Lodge.

481
00:24:45,712 --> 00:24:49,652
He just bought Sunnyside Trailer
Park and he said we can all stay.

482
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,014
We're staying!

483
00:24:53,251 --> 00:24:55,543
Jug... Jug...

484
00:25:06,384 --> 00:25:08,743
First your dad buys the drive-in,

485
00:25:08,746 --> 00:25:11,102
now no owns Sunnyside Trailer Park.

486
00:25:11,105 --> 00:25:12,704
As I suspected, he's gobbling up

487
00:25:12,707 --> 00:25:14,251
the Southside, piece by piece...

488
00:25:14,254 --> 00:25:15,454
Wait, slow down.

489
00:25:15,457 --> 00:25:18,079
Mr. Lodge is the one evicting
people from the trailer park?

490
00:25:18,082 --> 00:25:20,209
No, technically, he
cleared us of our debts

491
00:25:20,211 --> 00:25:21,577
and revoked the evictions.

492
00:25:21,579 --> 00:25:23,446
Does that mean you get
to keep your trailer?

493
00:25:23,448 --> 00:25:25,982
Yes, so why are you outraged?

494
00:25:25,985 --> 00:25:27,517
Because it's a tactic.

495
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,786
It's a smokescreen, PR 101.

496
00:25:29,788 --> 00:25:31,232
He's trying to buy my silence again.

497
00:25:31,235 --> 00:25:34,358
Good Lord, Jughead, how
much of a narcissist are you?

498
00:25:34,361 --> 00:25:37,407
Jughead, you wrote an
article attacking Mr. Lodge

499
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,876
and demanding that he makes amends.

500
00:25:38,879 --> 00:25:40,580
It sounds like that's
what he's trying to do.

501
00:25:41,769 --> 00:25:43,704
They do kind of have a point.

502
00:25:43,707 --> 00:25:45,301
Look, Jug,

503
00:25:45,303 --> 00:25:47,370
I know you love conspiracies,

504
00:25:47,373 --> 00:25:50,865
but take the win, bro,
and let's celebrate.

505
00:25:50,868 --> 00:25:53,643
I credit you with a
lot of things, Josie,

506
00:25:53,646 --> 00:25:56,102
but being cruel is not one of them.

507
00:25:56,105 --> 00:25:58,188
Tom told me what you said to Kevin.

508
00:25:58,191 --> 00:26:00,813
Yeah, well, I think he
deserved to know the truth.

509
00:26:00,816 --> 00:26:03,252
So maybe he could save
his parents' marriage.

510
00:26:03,254 --> 00:26:05,154
Now Kevin's not talking to his father,

511
00:26:05,156 --> 00:26:07,390
and Tom's trying to reach
his wife. It's a mess.

512
00:26:07,392 --> 00:26:09,292
Yeah, like what you did to us.

513
00:26:09,294 --> 00:26:12,628
Imploding our lives?
Without even telling me?

514
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:16,199
I did not implode our
lives, the Lodges did.

515
00:26:16,201 --> 00:26:18,501
It's not how I wanted
things to come out,

516
00:26:18,503 --> 00:26:20,503
but that choice was taken away from me.

517
00:26:20,505 --> 00:26:24,173
Just like you took it
away from Tom and Kevin.

518
00:26:25,714 --> 00:26:27,696
I wasn't trying to hurt them.

519
00:26:27,699 --> 00:26:30,289
And I wasn't trying to hurt you, either.

520
00:26:45,964 --> 00:26:48,493
Kevin. Hey.

521
00:26:48,496 --> 00:26:49,869
You here with anyone?

522
00:26:49,872 --> 00:26:52,068
Hey, Moose. Midge.

523
00:26:52,071 --> 00:26:54,871
Nope. Uh, I'm alone.

524
00:26:56,508 --> 00:26:59,442
In that case, grab your
plate and come sit with us.

525
00:27:00,645 --> 00:27:03,880
- Right, Moose?
- Yeah, definitely.

526
00:27:03,882 --> 00:27:05,615
The more the merrier.

527
00:27:06,975 --> 00:27:08,712
Why the hell not?

528
00:27:08,715 --> 00:27:13,446
So, Kevin, who are you
meeting at the movie?

529
00:27:13,449 --> 00:27:15,165
Some dreamboat?

530
00:27:15,168 --> 00:27:17,126
Oh, no, I don't have a date.

531
00:27:17,129 --> 00:27:20,399
I'm just going to
this gay rom-com alone.

532
00:27:20,402 --> 00:27:21,734
What?

533
00:27:22,987 --> 00:27:26,532
No. No, that's crazy. We
need to find you someone.

534
00:27:26,535 --> 00:27:29,509
What about one of those
new Southside guys?

535
00:27:29,512 --> 00:27:30,829
I hear one of them's gay.

536
00:27:30,832 --> 00:27:34,042
If it's Fangs Fogarty, I don't
think I can date someone named Fangs.

537
00:27:34,045 --> 00:27:35,611
I don't know, he's a good-looking dude.

538
00:27:35,614 --> 00:27:36,837
Oh, my God.

539
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,248
Please. What do you know, you big lug?

540
00:27:44,522 --> 00:27:46,856
Hey, so, how did you two, uh,

541
00:27:46,858 --> 00:27:48,342
get to be friends, anyway?

542
00:27:48,345 --> 00:27:51,461
Uh, we, um...

543
00:27:53,398 --> 00:27:55,298
- We were...
- Mmm-hmm.

544
00:27:55,301 --> 00:27:56,977
Lab partners.

545
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:59,126
Biology.

546
00:27:59,129 --> 00:28:00,571
Oh.

547
00:28:41,246 --> 00:28:42,612
Kevin?

548
00:28:43,882 --> 00:28:45,266
Josie.

549
00:28:45,269 --> 00:28:47,645
You're not here to tell
me more bad news, are you?

550
00:28:47,648 --> 00:28:49,318
'Cause I don't think I
can take that right now.

551
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,899
No, no.

552
00:28:50,902 --> 00:28:53,222
I had to get out of the house,

553
00:28:53,224 --> 00:28:55,024
so I came here.

554
00:28:55,027 --> 00:28:57,660
And I saw you and, um...

555
00:28:57,663 --> 00:29:00,696
I'm sorry about what I said.

556
00:29:00,699 --> 00:29:04,166
I... It wasn't my place to do that.

557
00:29:04,169 --> 00:29:07,016
I was just hurting and mad at my mom.

558
00:29:07,019 --> 00:29:08,852
It's okay, Josie.

559
00:29:10,497 --> 00:29:12,079
Um...

560
00:29:12,082 --> 00:29:14,510
You here with somebody?

561
00:29:18,683 --> 00:29:23,641
Let me guess... Some cherry
cola for Cheryl Bombshell.

562
00:29:23,644 --> 00:29:26,134
Oh, my God. What do you want?

563
00:29:26,137 --> 00:29:27,557
And why do you keep stalking me?

564
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,704
I'm not.

565
00:29:28,707 --> 00:29:31,720
I came to see this movie with
Fangs and he bailed on me.

566
00:29:34,917 --> 00:29:36,150
Are you okay?

567
00:29:37,696 --> 00:29:39,869
I'm alone at the movies

568
00:29:39,872 --> 00:29:42,004
and I'm trying to stay
away from my mother,

569
00:29:42,007 --> 00:29:44,774
who has turned our house
into her sexual playpen.

570
00:29:47,111 --> 00:29:50,780
So, no, I'm really not.

571
00:29:50,783 --> 00:29:55,017
Well, I was gonna go grab a seat alone,

572
00:29:55,019 --> 00:29:57,153
unless you want some company.

573
00:29:57,155 --> 00:29:59,422
But no pressure.

574
00:30:05,363 --> 00:30:08,331
But these last few years,

575
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:11,587
it's almost like I can feel
you holding your breath.

576
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:15,868
You are still you, Simon.

577
00:30:15,871 --> 00:30:20,852
You get to be more you than you
have been in a very long time.

578
00:30:20,855 --> 00:30:23,985
You deserve everything you want.

579
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:26,115
I have a hotel in Park Place,

580
00:30:26,117 --> 00:30:30,586
which brings your total to $1,500.

581
00:30:30,589 --> 00:30:32,755
Sorry, Bee. It's nothing personal.

582
00:30:32,757 --> 00:30:35,191
Yeah, I know. It's just business.

583
00:30:35,194 --> 00:30:36,720
Mmm-hmm.

584
00:30:39,126 --> 00:30:40,977
Ew. It's my mom.

585
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,282
Should I answer it?

586
00:30:42,285 --> 00:30:43,684
No!

587
00:30:43,687 --> 00:30:46,021
What if it's about Chic? Let me just...

588
00:30:47,268 --> 00:30:48,938
Hey, Mom, what's up?

589
00:30:48,941 --> 00:30:53,175
By the way, when are we
ever gonna get to meet Chic?

590
00:30:53,178 --> 00:30:55,077
I actually did before we left.

591
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:57,279
And how is he?

592
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:01,157
Honestly, he's kinda creepy.

593
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,384
- Guys...
- Everything okay?

594
00:31:03,387 --> 00:31:04,986
No, actually.

595
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:09,048
My mom is freaking out because

596
00:31:09,051 --> 00:31:12,261
Hiram Lodge just bought
the Riverdale Register.

597
00:31:18,808 --> 00:31:20,292
My mom is losing her mind.

598
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,283
My dad's not answering her calls.

599
00:31:22,286 --> 00:31:24,686
Veronica, did you know your
dad was buying the Register?

600
00:31:24,688 --> 00:31:26,714
What? No, Betty, of course not.

601
00:31:26,717 --> 00:31:28,230
See, this is what I'm talking about.

602
00:31:28,233 --> 00:31:29,378
Relax, Jughead.

603
00:31:29,381 --> 00:31:31,759
- Don't tell me to relax...
- Is that why you brought us up here?

604
00:31:31,761 --> 00:31:32,474
Yes.

605
00:31:32,477 --> 00:31:34,663
To get us out of town while
your dad was doing these things?

606
00:31:34,665 --> 00:31:36,331
Okay, now who sounds crazy?

607
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:40,097
Lodge Industries has been buying
properties all over the Southside.

608
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,279
Now he buys the one newspaper in town,

609
00:31:42,282 --> 00:31:44,406
so people can't report
on what he's doing?

610
00:31:44,408 --> 00:31:46,575
It's a classic gambit of
mobsters and criminals.

611
00:31:46,577 --> 00:31:47,826
Shut the hell up, Jughead.

612
00:31:47,829 --> 00:31:50,512
Archie, this one's pretty simple,
so even you might be able to get this

613
00:31:50,514 --> 00:31:53,181
if you stopped kissing up to
Hiram for, like, two seconds.

614
00:31:53,183 --> 00:31:54,950
How many times have I defended you?

615
00:31:54,952 --> 00:31:57,886
And now you turn and stab
my family in the back?

616
00:31:57,888 --> 00:31:59,409
It sounds to me like you should be mad

617
00:31:59,412 --> 00:32:02,257
at your dad for selling
the newspaper, not mine.

618
00:32:02,259 --> 00:32:05,389
Yeah, there's nothing, like,
evil about buying a newspaper.

619
00:32:05,392 --> 00:32:07,300
He's trying to silence
the free press, Archie.

620
00:32:07,303 --> 00:32:09,498
He's trying to keep Mrs.
Cooper from coming after him.

621
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,272
I am so sick of your
vendetta against my dad.

622
00:32:12,275 --> 00:32:13,602
He's done plenty of good things.

623
00:32:13,604 --> 00:32:16,608
Oh, like what? Name one thing.

624
00:32:16,611 --> 00:32:17,756
He's...

625
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:19,541
He paid my dad's medical bills.

626
00:32:19,543 --> 00:32:22,344
Boy, Archie, Veronica's got you
wrapped around her little finger.

627
00:32:22,346 --> 00:32:23,717
And other parts of her body.

628
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,315
Oh! I'm sorry.

629
00:32:26,318 --> 00:32:28,756
I'm sorry we don't spend
our time being tragic

630
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:32,287
and moping and holding hands while
watching serial killer documentaries.

631
00:32:32,289 --> 00:32:36,073
Oh, and wearing costumes to
role-play to get our rocks off.

632
00:32:37,704 --> 00:32:39,961
- Where did that come from?
- Who else knows we're here?

633
00:32:39,963 --> 00:32:41,296
Why'd you say it like that?

634
00:32:41,298 --> 00:32:42,431
Oh, my God.

635
00:32:42,433 --> 00:32:44,299
You rich summer folks never learn.

636
00:32:44,301 --> 00:32:46,201
You just keep walking around town,

637
00:32:46,203 --> 00:32:48,603
flashing more cash
than we see in a year.

638
00:32:48,605 --> 00:32:49,971
We're gonna take what we want,

639
00:32:49,973 --> 00:32:51,106
and then we're gonna go.

640
00:32:51,108 --> 00:32:52,774
If you guys behave yourselves,

641
00:32:52,776 --> 00:32:54,709
nobody gets their skulls knocked in.

642
00:32:57,347 --> 00:32:59,170
Fine, take what you want.

643
00:32:59,173 --> 00:33:00,579
We won't give you any trouble.

644
00:33:00,582 --> 00:33:01,981
Where's your purse?

645
00:33:01,984 --> 00:33:03,842
Um, it's...

646
00:33:05,456 --> 00:33:07,308
In my bedroom.

647
00:33:07,311 --> 00:33:09,191
- Let's go to the bedroom.
- No.

648
00:33:09,193 --> 00:33:11,593
No way are you going with
her up there alone. I'll go.

649
00:33:11,596 --> 00:33:14,928
Archie, it's fine.

650
00:33:14,931 --> 00:33:16,401
I'll be fine.

651
00:33:16,404 --> 00:33:18,131
We'll be right back.

652
00:33:18,134 --> 00:33:20,200
Everybody just needs to stay calm.

653
00:33:30,992 --> 00:33:33,026
It's over there.

654
00:33:33,029 --> 00:33:35,951
I'm just going to pick it up, okay?

655
00:33:46,421 --> 00:33:48,187
Why are you doing this?

656
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,394
You think I don't recognize you?

657
00:33:58,397 --> 00:33:59,608
From the store?

658
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:01,309
Shut up and get your wallet.

659
00:34:25,094 --> 00:34:26,293
Can we go already?

660
00:34:26,296 --> 00:34:27,295
You got the cash?

661
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:29,270
Yeah. I got the cash.

662
00:34:29,273 --> 00:34:30,839
Then you got what you wanted.

663
00:34:30,842 --> 00:34:33,881
Not everything, not yet.

664
00:34:33,884 --> 00:34:36,278
Why don't you all get
down on your knees?

665
00:34:36,281 --> 00:34:38,131
Come on, man, let's not do this.

666
00:34:38,134 --> 00:34:39,147
Shut up.

667
00:34:39,149 --> 00:34:41,612
I said, on your knees.

668
00:34:41,615 --> 00:34:43,730
Hands behind your backs.

669
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:45,287
Do it!

670
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,701
It's a nice cabin.

671
00:35:01,704 --> 00:35:04,259
I'm sorry we have to
make such a mess in it.

672
00:35:06,365 --> 00:35:08,143
The hell is that?

673
00:35:08,145 --> 00:35:10,178
That would be the security company

674
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,706
calling to check on the silent
alarm I hit in my bedroom.

675
00:35:12,709 --> 00:35:15,450
I'd say you hillbillies have
about 30 seconds to run for it

676
00:35:15,452 --> 00:35:17,185
before this place is
swarming with guards

677
00:35:17,187 --> 00:35:19,554
who will shoot first
and ask questions never.

678
00:35:24,167 --> 00:35:26,133
Screw you, rich bitch.

679
00:35:28,432 --> 00:35:30,699
- Archie, don't!
- No, Arch!

680
00:35:48,286 --> 00:35:50,218
Andre...

681
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,953
There were some other guys
with him. Did you see them?

682
00:35:51,955 --> 00:35:55,023
Go back to the cabin.
I'll take it from here.

683
00:35:55,025 --> 00:35:56,925
What? What are you gonna do?

684
00:35:56,927 --> 00:35:58,727
I said,

685
00:35:58,729 --> 00:36:00,061
I'll take care of it.

686
00:36:28,551 --> 00:36:32,720
First of all, thank you,
Mom and Sheriff Keller

687
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:34,922
for coming to meet me and Kevin.

688
00:36:34,925 --> 00:36:37,158
We promise you this isn't a trap.

689
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,962
It's that Kevin and I were
talking after the movie,

690
00:36:40,964 --> 00:36:43,097
and we thought...

691
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,087
This conversation is
bigger than just two people.

692
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:48,738
It's bigger than the
people in this booth, even.

693
00:36:48,741 --> 00:36:51,506
And it's probably gonna be a long one,

694
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:55,426
so we should get started.

695
00:37:06,156 --> 00:37:08,856
Now you may think you've
mastered the art of silent tears,

696
00:37:08,858 --> 00:37:11,692
but I saw you crying
during that movie, Cheryl.

697
00:37:11,694 --> 00:37:13,428
I never cry at movies.

698
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:15,899
Real life's tragic enough.

699
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:18,941
But when Simon's mom

700
00:37:18,944 --> 00:37:22,036
said he used to be such a
carefree kid, growing up,

701
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:24,324
and then at a certain point

702
00:37:24,327 --> 00:37:28,142
he stopped being that happy kid

703
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:30,478
because he was hiding
a secret, it just...

704
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,079
Cheryl...

705
00:37:33,383 --> 00:37:37,407
Everyone thinks I'm
this loveless monster,

706
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:39,316
but it isn't true.

707
00:37:41,791 --> 00:37:44,592
I loved someone

708
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,295
who loved me.

709
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,423
And my mother destroyed it.

710
00:37:50,426 --> 00:37:52,500
You mean your brother Jason?

711
00:37:53,837 --> 00:37:56,121
I heard how close you guys were.

712
00:37:56,124 --> 00:37:58,658
No, not Jay-Jay.

713
00:38:01,578 --> 00:38:04,769
Her name was Heather.

714
00:38:09,198 --> 00:38:12,644
She was my best friend in junior high.

715
00:38:12,647 --> 00:38:15,465
She used to sleep over every weekend.

716
00:38:15,468 --> 00:38:17,434
Until one night,

717
00:38:17,437 --> 00:38:20,394
my mother caught us in the same bed.

718
00:38:20,397 --> 00:38:23,808
She said I was "deviant".

719
00:38:25,102 --> 00:38:28,063
Cheryl, I am so sorry.

720
00:38:28,073 --> 00:38:30,979
But you have to know
your mother's wrong.

721
00:38:30,982 --> 00:38:33,274
You're not loveless.

722
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:36,168
You're not deviant. Okay?

723
00:38:38,414 --> 00:38:41,382
You're sensational.

724
00:38:50,644 --> 00:38:53,679
Thank God Andre didn't
leave when I told him to.

725
00:38:55,894 --> 00:38:58,965
Thank God you didn't catch up
to that hillbilly in the woods.

726
00:38:58,968 --> 00:39:01,068
He might've killed you, Archie,

727
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:02,937
and that would've been...

728
00:39:16,352 --> 00:39:17,919
Archie didn't say any more

729
00:39:17,921 --> 00:39:20,785
about what happened in the
woods that terrible night.

730
00:39:20,788 --> 00:39:23,289
At least, not to us.

731
00:39:26,996 --> 00:39:29,330
Veronica told me what
happened in the cabin.

732
00:39:30,466 --> 00:39:32,308
And Andre told me the rest.

733
00:39:32,311 --> 00:39:34,111
You did the right thing
by telling those boys

734
00:39:34,114 --> 00:39:35,781
to take what they wanted and get out.

735
00:39:35,784 --> 00:39:37,617
It was the smart choice.

736
00:39:38,975 --> 00:39:40,608
It was the only choice.

737
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:44,679
Thank you for saying that, Mr. Lodge.

738
00:39:50,543 --> 00:39:52,907
What happened between

739
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:55,070
Andre and that miscreant...

740
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,547
Did that bother you?

741
00:39:59,762 --> 00:40:02,363
What Andre did?

742
00:40:05,935 --> 00:40:08,436
The night we stopped the Black Hood,

743
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,674
there's only one thing that I regret.

744
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:15,699
I had him.

745
00:40:15,702 --> 00:40:18,646
The man who tried to
kill my dad, I had him.

746
00:40:20,116 --> 00:40:21,415
And I hesitated.

747
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:24,150
And he might've gotten away

748
00:40:24,153 --> 00:40:26,032
if it wasn't for Sheriff Keller.

749
00:40:26,042 --> 00:40:29,631
When it comes to protecting
yourself or your loved ones,

750
00:40:31,113 --> 00:40:33,769
you never, ever, hesitate.

751
00:40:48,026 --> 00:40:51,127
You can stop worrying now. I'm home.

752
00:40:52,181 --> 00:40:54,115
As we were driving
back from The Shining,

753
00:40:54,117 --> 00:40:55,716
I was thinking...

754
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:57,879
There's more than one
kind of home invasion.

755
00:40:57,882 --> 00:41:00,186
It's not always fast and violent.

756
00:41:00,189 --> 00:41:01,622
Sometimes we open the door

757
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,945
and we let the intruders in ourselves.

758
00:41:03,948 --> 00:41:05,659
What do you mean?

759
00:41:07,463 --> 00:41:10,598
Before we left, I got a
really weird vibe from Chic.

760
00:41:12,568 --> 00:41:14,201
Just be careful, okay?

761
00:41:20,777 --> 00:41:22,443
- Bye.
- Bye.

762
00:41:27,733 --> 00:41:30,246
And so this chapter comes full circle.

763
00:41:30,249 --> 00:41:32,285
Ending where it began.

764
00:41:32,288 --> 00:41:35,156
With a girl in a house

765
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,772
that was far from sweet,

766
00:41:36,775 --> 00:41:40,122
and perhaps far from safe.

767
