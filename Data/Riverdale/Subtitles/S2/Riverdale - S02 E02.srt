1
00:00:00,027 --> 00:00:02,852
Previously on Riverdale...

2
00:00:03,979 --> 00:00:06,468
This man... His goal was something else.

3
00:00:06,471 --> 00:00:09,250
It was like Angel of Death
had come to Riverdale.

4
00:00:10,557 --> 00:00:11,718
Hello, Dilton.

5
00:00:11,721 --> 00:00:12,932
Somebody has to teach them how to stand

6
00:00:12,934 --> 00:00:14,263
their ground. The way
this town is going...

7
00:00:14,265 --> 00:00:16,665
Your father's facing serious jail time.

8
00:00:16,668 --> 00:00:18,382
Serpents take care of their own.

9
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:19,551
We got your back.

10
00:00:19,554 --> 00:00:22,805
Smithers, would you describe
my father as a good man?

11
00:00:22,808 --> 00:00:24,241
I'd rather not say, miss.

12
00:00:24,243 --> 00:00:27,382
I told your father that you were...
Conflicted about helping him.

13
00:00:27,393 --> 00:00:29,211
"If you do not testify, your poor mother

14
00:00:29,214 --> 00:00:31,164
might be drawn into this awful mess."

15
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:34,162
Whether or not Sheriff Keller finds
the person who did this or not,

16
00:00:34,165 --> 00:00:35,364
you don't have to worry.

17
00:00:35,367 --> 00:00:37,420
I'm gonna protect you. I swear it.

18
00:00:38,357 --> 00:00:41,024
Behold, Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe.

19
00:00:41,027 --> 00:00:43,433
For decades, the heart of Riverdale.

20
00:00:46,431 --> 00:00:48,064
What the hell?

21
00:00:48,761 --> 00:00:52,002
Now, the latest casualty
in the town's ongoing battle

22
00:00:52,004 --> 00:00:53,537
against darkness.

23
00:01:00,345 --> 00:01:02,012
- Pop?
- Did you see?

24
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:05,143
Did you see what they wrote
on my Chock'lit Shoppe?

25
00:01:09,855 --> 00:01:11,154
No, no, no, no.

26
00:01:11,156 --> 00:01:13,857
Do we need a fire extinguisher?

27
00:01:14,548 --> 00:01:16,899
What are you doing up? I was
going to bring you breakfast.

28
00:01:16,902 --> 00:01:18,360
I appreciate it, son.

29
00:01:18,363 --> 00:01:20,764
But I've gotta get to
moving around sometime.

30
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:24,734
Little early for that, isn't it?

31
00:01:24,737 --> 00:01:26,236
No, I'm good.

32
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:27,804
Dad, the only thing you
need to be worrying about

33
00:01:27,806 --> 00:01:28,805
is getting better.

34
00:01:30,028 --> 00:01:33,310
Crap. I gotta take
this. I gotta go. Bye.

35
00:01:36,014 --> 00:01:37,214
Hi. Sheriff Keller?

36
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:41,051
No, no. Deputy, I've been
leaving messages for the sheriff.

37
00:01:41,054 --> 00:01:43,894
I need him to call me
back about my dad's case.

38
00:01:50,929 --> 00:01:52,562
TTFN, Smithers.

39
00:01:52,565 --> 00:01:56,266
Oh, wait, Ms. Veronica. You
might want to take the side exit.

40
00:01:56,269 --> 00:01:58,134
Why?

41
00:01:58,137 --> 00:01:59,503
Yeah, why, Smithers?

42
00:01:59,506 --> 00:02:01,979
Because she might bump into
me coming in from an early run?

43
00:02:01,982 --> 00:02:03,262
Good morning, Father.

44
00:02:03,265 --> 00:02:05,675
Mija. You leave before breakfast,

45
00:02:05,677 --> 00:02:08,722
you come after your mother
and I have had dinner.

46
00:02:08,725 --> 00:02:10,347
I can't remember the last time

47
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:11,681
we had meal together as a family.

48
00:02:11,683 --> 00:02:14,284
I can. It was at the Dakota.

49
00:02:14,286 --> 00:02:15,919
The day you got arrested.

50
00:02:17,086 --> 00:02:19,153
Well, perhaps we should talk about that.

51
00:02:19,156 --> 00:02:21,625
Tonight, at dinner. The three of us.

52
00:02:21,628 --> 00:02:24,027
Unfortunately, I have plans.

53
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,183
To quote that New Yorker cartoon,

54
00:02:26,186 --> 00:02:29,515
how about never, Dad,
is never good for you?

55
00:02:30,955 --> 00:02:32,688
It's another win for the bad guys.

56
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,521
No one was there. His entire staff quit.

57
00:02:36,143 --> 00:02:37,343
He says he's not sure how long

58
00:02:37,346 --> 00:02:38,875
he'll be able to keep the doors open,

59
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:40,077
maybe not even a week.

60
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,939
It's because of what happened to my dad.

61
00:02:41,942 --> 00:02:44,047
People are freaking out.
And I gotta be honest, guys,

62
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:46,182
I don't see myself
going back any time soon.

63
00:02:46,185 --> 00:02:49,799
Wait, I'm sorry, am
I hearing acceptance?

64
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:52,527
I'm not letting one
psychopath with a gun

65
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,964
dictate what happens to our place.

66
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:59,025
Jug, you went crazy trying
to save the drive-in.

67
00:02:59,028 --> 00:03:02,899
I can't take on any more
social issues right now.

68
00:03:02,902 --> 00:03:04,000
My hands are full.

69
00:03:04,002 --> 00:03:06,036
With your dad, of course.

70
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,537
And he should be your priority.

71
00:03:08,975 --> 00:03:11,495
I'll take point on helping Pop Tate.

72
00:03:11,498 --> 00:03:12,697
I'll help, too, Betty.

73
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,432
Hey, anything to get me
away from my parents, I'm in.

74
00:03:15,435 --> 00:03:17,614
Another Bee and Vee team-up.

75
00:03:17,616 --> 00:03:19,516
They should really make a
video game about you guys.

76
00:03:19,518 --> 00:03:20,918
I gotta jet.

77
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:24,383
I'm off to meet my dad's
court-appointed joke

78
00:03:24,386 --> 00:03:26,282
of a lawyer at the sheriff's station.

79
00:03:26,285 --> 00:03:27,569
I'm gonna come with you, Jug.

80
00:03:27,572 --> 00:03:29,452
I gotta drop some flyers
off for Sheriff Keller.

81
00:03:29,455 --> 00:03:30,827
Bye.

82
00:03:42,874 --> 00:03:44,341
Sheriff Keller.

83
00:03:45,165 --> 00:03:47,054
Archie, how's your dad holding up?

84
00:03:47,057 --> 00:03:48,718
Honestly, he'd be doing a lot better

85
00:03:48,721 --> 00:03:50,273
if you caught the guy who shot him.

86
00:03:50,276 --> 00:03:52,317
We're doing everything we can.

87
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,558
Yeah, me, too. I'm out
here handing out flyers,

88
00:03:54,561 --> 00:03:56,093
talking to neighbors,

89
00:03:56,096 --> 00:03:57,520
tracking my dad's credit cards

90
00:03:57,523 --> 00:03:59,089
because his wallet is still missing.

91
00:03:59,092 --> 00:04:01,385
Which means this guy has all
of our personal information,

92
00:04:01,388 --> 00:04:03,155
including where we live.

93
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:04,694
And we were witnesses.

94
00:04:04,697 --> 00:04:07,309
If your guys are out
there patrolling, Sheriff,

95
00:04:07,312 --> 00:04:09,132
- let me go with them, I can help.
- Oh, no.

96
00:04:09,134 --> 00:04:12,335
10-4. We've got a 53 in Greendale.

97
00:04:12,338 --> 00:04:15,999
Greendale? All right, copy
that. Just give me a sec.

98
00:04:16,002 --> 00:04:17,774
Let us do our job.

99
00:04:17,777 --> 00:04:19,709
You take care.

100
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,973
Let's talk about the damn deal.

101
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:30,122
First, to review the
charges you're facing,

102
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:34,544
arson, destruction of evidence,
making a false confession,

103
00:04:34,547 --> 00:04:36,926
obstructing justice, not to mention this

104
00:04:36,929 --> 00:04:39,225
whole nasty mess of dumping
a dead kid in the river.

105
00:04:39,228 --> 00:04:40,730
I know what I did.

106
00:04:41,867 --> 00:04:43,233
What's the deal?

107
00:04:43,802 --> 00:04:45,201
What are they offering?

108
00:04:45,871 --> 00:04:47,270
You're gonna want to take it.

109
00:04:48,715 --> 00:04:50,982
I'm telling you, I've been
doing this a long time.

110
00:04:50,985 --> 00:04:52,409
It's a strong deal.

111
00:04:52,412 --> 00:04:56,635
How many damn years?

112
00:05:15,967 --> 00:05:18,383
Whoa, whoa!

113
00:05:18,386 --> 00:05:21,687
- Jughead. Are you insane?
- Hey

114
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,395
You're the one that looks like a Dream

115
00:05:23,405 --> 00:05:26,260
Warrior from Nightmare on Elm Street 3.

116
00:05:26,263 --> 00:05:28,700
What did the lawyer say?

117
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:32,697
I've been walking
around all night trying

118
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,548
to wrap my head around how bad it is.

119
00:05:35,551 --> 00:05:37,187
It's bad.

120
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,838
My dad is facing 20 years, Arch.

121
00:05:44,061 --> 00:05:46,528
Crap, Jughead, I'm sorry. That sucks.

122
00:05:48,244 --> 00:05:50,600
The lawyer thinks he
should take the deal.

123
00:05:50,603 --> 00:05:52,688
And that if he doesn't,
and the case goes

124
00:05:52,691 --> 00:05:55,332
to trial, he could be facing 40 years.

125
00:05:59,144 --> 00:06:01,745
I'm just really, really scared.

126
00:06:04,223 --> 00:06:05,889
Yeah, me, too.

127
00:06:06,485 --> 00:06:08,084
About what?

128
00:06:15,735 --> 00:06:19,045
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

129
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:22,805
I couldn't sleep last night, Jug.

130
00:06:22,807 --> 00:06:25,734
I kept thinking about
your dad, and Pop's.

131
00:06:25,736 --> 00:06:28,771
And how maybe we can kill
two birds with one stone.

132
00:06:34,445 --> 00:06:36,312
Can you meet me at the Mayor's office?

133
00:06:37,014 --> 00:06:39,114
Okay, great, I'll get it set.

134
00:06:39,117 --> 00:06:40,549
But right now, I need to call...

135
00:06:40,551 --> 00:06:42,084
Hey, Bee, what's up?

136
00:06:48,766 --> 00:06:51,367
I know you haven't been
sleeping in your room.

137
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:54,940
So where exactly have you
been spending your nights?

138
00:06:54,943 --> 00:06:56,760
- So, Betty.
- Yes, Betty.

139
00:06:56,763 --> 00:06:59,112
Ever since you and your dad
got home from the hospital,

140
00:06:59,115 --> 00:07:03,276
she's noticed your room's
been unusually empty and quiet.

141
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,807
Why?

142
00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:08,866
So I can... Watch the doors.

143
00:07:08,869 --> 00:07:11,246
So I can make sure no one comes in.

144
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:15,584
I know it sounds crazy,
but the guy who shot my dad

145
00:07:15,586 --> 00:07:17,019
is still out there, Ronnie,

146
00:07:17,988 --> 00:07:21,322
and I'm scared he's gonna come back

147
00:07:21,325 --> 00:07:22,891
and finish the job.

148
00:07:22,894 --> 00:07:24,617
Archie,

149
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:28,230
you went through
something deeply traumatic.

150
00:07:28,233 --> 00:07:29,965
Can I make a suggestion?

151
00:07:29,968 --> 00:07:31,701
Please. Anything.

152
00:07:31,704 --> 00:07:33,836
When I lived in New York,

153
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:36,909
I saw a therapist once a
week to help me get through

154
00:07:36,912 --> 00:07:39,274
all sorts of Park Avenue drama.

155
00:07:39,277 --> 00:07:42,096
Now, I'm not saying to go
see a therapist, Archie,

156
00:07:42,099 --> 00:07:45,838
but maybe the school
counselor could help?

157
00:07:50,821 --> 00:07:52,812
Mayor McCoy.

158
00:07:52,815 --> 00:07:55,237
Betty, Jughead. What
can I help you with?

159
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,394
So, the Chock'lit Shoppe
is on the verge of closing,

160
00:07:58,396 --> 00:08:00,629
and we want Pop Tate to
know that the entire town

161
00:08:00,631 --> 00:08:02,498
is rallying behind him.

162
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,101
We were thinking that you could...

163
00:08:04,104 --> 00:08:06,531
Make the building a landmark,

164
00:08:06,534 --> 00:08:09,054
or declare a "Pop's Day" in support?

165
00:08:09,057 --> 00:08:12,241
What if I endorse Pop's, and next
week someone else is shot there?

166
00:08:12,243 --> 00:08:16,421
My priority as a mayor and as a
mother is keeping this town safe.

167
00:08:16,424 --> 00:08:19,314
If we have to close
Pop's, I'm all for it.

168
00:08:19,317 --> 00:08:21,817
Are you also "all for" shipping
my dad off to a state prison

169
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:23,952
- for a murder that he didn't commit?
- Shh.

170
00:08:23,955 --> 00:08:25,588
What is this, an ambush?

171
00:08:25,591 --> 00:08:27,994
I know you have an in
with the State Attorney.

172
00:08:27,997 --> 00:08:30,516
If you could just call him and
try to get my dad a better lawyer,

173
00:08:30,518 --> 00:08:31,491
anything?

174
00:08:31,494 --> 00:08:33,697
Your father made some mistakes,

175
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,031
I'm sure he'll get a fair hearing.

176
00:08:36,034 --> 00:08:37,566
Mayor McCoy?

177
00:08:37,569 --> 00:08:39,299
You remember this moment.

178
00:08:39,846 --> 00:08:42,004
'Cause this is the moment
that you turned your back

179
00:08:42,006 --> 00:08:43,972
on both Pop Tate and my father.

180
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,046
Midge Klump.

181
00:08:56,887 --> 00:08:58,554
The Klumpster.

182
00:08:58,557 --> 00:09:00,022
Reggie,

183
00:09:00,025 --> 00:09:02,358
what do you know about jingji-jangle?

184
00:09:02,361 --> 00:09:06,134
I know you shouldn't say it so
loud while we're on school property.

185
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:08,611
And that I can score you some.

186
00:09:09,233 --> 00:09:10,733
Who's it for?

187
00:09:10,736 --> 00:09:12,169
Me and Moose.

188
00:09:13,104 --> 00:09:14,666
Lemme see what I can do.

189
00:09:21,746 --> 00:09:23,612
What's on your mind, Andrews?

190
00:09:23,615 --> 00:09:25,848
Girl troubles, scabies?

191
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:29,885
Why are you seeking
guidance from Ms. Burble?

192
00:09:29,888 --> 00:09:31,681
- I'm not.
- Maybe you should.

193
00:09:31,684 --> 00:09:34,089
You look like my nuts
after football practice.

194
00:09:34,091 --> 00:09:37,826
Hey. Do you have anything
that can help keep me awake?

195
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:39,054
Many things.

196
00:09:39,057 --> 00:09:43,565
Amphetamines, Baclofen,
Modafinil, jingle-jangle.

197
00:09:43,567 --> 00:09:44,767
Jingle-jangle?

198
00:09:46,337 --> 00:09:50,472
That'll keep you up for
days, in more ways than one.

199
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:53,275
But why do you need
uppers, Wonder Bread?

200
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:55,878
Until the guy who shot my dad is caught,

201
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,279
I wanna be on high alert.

202
00:09:58,182 --> 00:10:00,501
So, can you help me or not, Reggie?

203
00:10:00,504 --> 00:10:02,251
I got you, Andrews.

204
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,489
We can't let the terrorists win.

205
00:10:07,492 --> 00:10:09,858
We need to host an event at Pop's

206
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,212
that reminds the town of simpler times.

207
00:10:12,215 --> 00:10:15,985
Like, a throwback to when the
shoppe first opened its doors.

208
00:10:15,988 --> 00:10:18,866
Betty, I like a good
milkshake as much as any girl,

209
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:22,104
and Pop's puts Serendipity 3's to shame.

210
00:10:22,106 --> 00:10:24,706
But, why this hill to die on?

211
00:10:28,846 --> 00:10:32,946
Orange freezes with my
mom and Polly after ballet.

212
00:10:32,956 --> 00:10:36,392
Chicken noodle soup with
my dad after ice-skating...

213
00:10:36,395 --> 00:10:40,289
Grilled cheeses with Archie on
the last day of summer vacation.

214
00:10:41,525 --> 00:10:44,259
It's where I met you
for the first time, Vee.

215
00:10:45,162 --> 00:10:47,196
It's where I met you for the first time.

216
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:50,916
Also...

217
00:10:52,364 --> 00:10:53,664
Jug.

218
00:10:56,507 --> 00:10:58,273
He may lose his dad,

219
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:05,581
but maybe I can save this one
place for him... For all of us.

220
00:11:06,885 --> 00:11:10,743
Hey. Veronica. May I speak to you?

221
00:11:10,746 --> 00:11:12,087
Daddy?

222
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:13,667
- Daddy?
- Daddy?

223
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:16,458
Every day I was in prison, I
thought about getting back to you

224
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,160
and your mother.

225
00:11:18,163 --> 00:11:20,206
And I knew it wouldn't be easy,

226
00:11:20,209 --> 00:11:22,030
I knew it would take time.

227
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:26,368
Meet me halfway.

228
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:28,904
Don't you think I want to, Daddy?

229
00:11:28,907 --> 00:11:32,721
Don't you think I want everything
to go back to the way it was?

230
00:11:32,724 --> 00:11:36,178
The three of us, walking into
some fabulous gala or ball.

231
00:11:36,181 --> 00:11:38,814
You with your two favorite girls.

232
00:11:38,817 --> 00:11:40,317
But...

233
00:11:41,103 --> 00:11:42,569
I can't.

234
00:11:43,921 --> 00:11:46,822
The blindfold's off, Daddy,
I can't just put it back on.

235
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,828
I'm sorry, but I should
get back to my friends.

236
00:11:52,831 --> 00:11:55,634
Yeah, hey, so... Were you, uh...

237
00:11:55,637 --> 00:11:57,332
Planning a dance in there?

238
00:11:57,335 --> 00:11:59,556
An event. To keep Pop's from closing.

239
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:01,003
Well, if I can help in any way...

240
00:12:01,005 --> 00:12:02,337
I'll let you know.

241
00:12:04,037 --> 00:12:05,756
I tried going the legit route.

242
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,342
I even talked to the mayor. It's just...

243
00:12:07,344 --> 00:12:09,945
It feels like the whole
system's rigged against us.

244
00:12:09,948 --> 00:12:11,296
What's FP saying?

245
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:12,936
Is he taking this deal?

246
00:12:12,939 --> 00:12:14,324
Not if I can help it.

247
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:16,351
Tall Boy...

248
00:12:18,622 --> 00:12:20,322
What if we bust him out of jail

249
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:22,057
before he gets transferred to state?

250
00:12:24,328 --> 00:12:26,128
It's totally doable.
The sheriff's station

251
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,297
has worse security than Riverdale High.

252
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,999
And once he's out, it's just a
straight shot right up Sweetwater River

253
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:32,734
until the Canadian border.

254
00:12:32,737 --> 00:12:36,391
You've seen Escape From Alcatraz
a few too many times, kid.

255
00:12:36,394 --> 00:12:38,173
Your dad needs a snake-handler.

256
00:12:39,043 --> 00:12:41,443
Someone whose livelihood
depends on snakes.

257
00:12:41,446 --> 00:12:43,229
Who's used to dealing with 'em.

258
00:12:43,232 --> 00:12:44,510
I got someone you should meet.

259
00:12:46,504 --> 00:12:48,377
Humpty and Dumpty.

260
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,580
Just in time to meet our newest recruit.

261
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,480
In addition to my duties as a Pussycat.

262
00:12:52,483 --> 00:12:55,424
And, I just wanna say,
girls, I'm so excited

263
00:12:55,427 --> 00:12:56,783
to work on my moves

264
00:12:56,786 --> 00:12:58,486
and to be a team player,

265
00:12:58,489 --> 00:12:59,721
as long as I'm in the front.

266
00:13:01,231 --> 00:13:02,731
Wait, Cheryl,

267
00:13:02,734 --> 00:13:05,600
does that mean you're taking
the Vixens back from me?

268
00:13:05,602 --> 00:13:07,382
But, really, Veronica,

269
00:13:07,385 --> 00:13:09,137
were they ever yours?

270
00:13:09,148 --> 00:13:12,849
Cheryl, we were wondering if
maybe the Vixens would help

271
00:13:12,852 --> 00:13:15,610
at an event to save Pop's.

272
00:13:18,569 --> 00:13:19,968
Oh, Betty.

273
00:13:19,971 --> 00:13:22,751
I did not emerge from the frozen
depths of Sweetwater River,

274
00:13:22,753 --> 00:13:24,252
nor the flames of Thornhill,

275
00:13:24,255 --> 00:13:26,120
to allow my Vixens to sling milkshakes

276
00:13:26,123 --> 00:13:27,820
at some death-cursed diner.

277
00:13:27,823 --> 00:13:30,525
The answer is a double-cherry-on-top no.

278
00:13:34,498 --> 00:13:35,797
Okay.

279
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:37,522
Great talk.

280
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,285
May I have everyone's attention?

281
00:13:41,438 --> 00:13:44,706
I have some tragic news to share.

282
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,241
Ms. Grundy,

283
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,459
who was a teacher here last semester,

284
00:13:51,246 --> 00:13:52,412
was found

285
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:56,151
murdered in her
Greendale home last night.

286
00:13:56,153 --> 00:13:57,352
Oh, my God.

287
00:14:00,124 --> 00:14:02,624
I know some of you
were students of hers,

288
00:14:03,827 --> 00:14:06,528
and that this news will
be difficult to process.

289
00:14:19,676 --> 00:14:21,309
Mr. Andrews?

290
00:14:26,812 --> 00:14:28,345
First, you get shot.

291
00:14:28,348 --> 00:14:30,080
Then, Ms. Grundy is murdered.

292
00:14:30,082 --> 00:14:31,882
All within a matter of days.

293
00:14:31,885 --> 00:14:36,379
Dad, what if some crazy person is going
after the people that I care about?

294
00:14:36,382 --> 00:14:38,055
What? You think I'm nuts?

295
00:14:38,057 --> 00:14:40,591
No, son, I think you're scared.

296
00:14:40,593 --> 00:14:42,159
Understandably so.

297
00:14:42,161 --> 00:14:45,832
Truth is, son, we don't know anything
about what happened to Ms. Grundy.

298
00:14:45,835 --> 00:14:48,616
She's dead, she was killed.

299
00:14:49,502 --> 00:14:51,610
Right across Sweetwater River.

300
00:14:51,613 --> 00:14:53,277
I know.

301
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,372
It was a horrible thing.

302
00:14:56,522 --> 00:14:58,322
Don't you wanna find out who did this?

303
00:14:58,325 --> 00:14:59,877
Who's doing this?

304
00:15:20,866 --> 00:15:25,202
I'm, uh, here for Penny Peabody?

305
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,719
Forgive the office space,

306
00:15:32,722 --> 00:15:34,789
but I'm a firm believer in low overhead.

307
00:15:34,792 --> 00:15:37,381
Plus, I like being close to my clients.

308
00:15:37,384 --> 00:15:39,183
Your clients...

309
00:15:39,186 --> 00:15:40,661
Being the Serpents?

310
00:15:40,664 --> 00:15:43,120
Well, I was and still am a Serpent.

311
00:15:45,691 --> 00:15:47,890
They put me through college,

312
00:15:47,893 --> 00:15:49,159
law school.

313
00:15:49,968 --> 00:15:51,401
Right.

314
00:15:51,404 --> 00:15:53,950
The Serpents are often on the
other side of the law, so...

315
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,233
Having one of their own,
on retainer, helping out

316
00:15:56,236 --> 00:15:57,793
is clever.

317
00:15:58,234 --> 00:16:00,838
Well, FP always bragged
that you were smart.

318
00:16:02,508 --> 00:16:04,541
Oh, yeah, I know your dad.

319
00:16:05,434 --> 00:16:09,670
And I also know, from
our, uh, mutual friends,

320
00:16:09,673 --> 00:16:11,785
the deal he's been offered.

321
00:16:11,788 --> 00:16:13,517
It's garbage.

322
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:15,879
Can you help?

323
00:16:15,882 --> 00:16:19,320
I know the loopholes. In
this case, there are none.

324
00:16:19,323 --> 00:16:23,093
But, if you get the victim's
family to forgive him,

325
00:16:23,096 --> 00:16:25,129
in front of a judge,

326
00:16:25,857 --> 00:16:28,258
that might shift things in FP's favor.

327
00:16:28,261 --> 00:16:30,819
Instead of 20 years,
he can get time served,

328
00:16:30,822 --> 00:16:32,870
- with parole.
- Oh, that's great.

329
00:16:32,873 --> 00:16:34,327
Yeah.

330
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:38,539
Thank you. Uh, am I
supposed to pay you, or...

331
00:16:38,542 --> 00:16:39,943
We're friends.

332
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,080
I do you a favor.

333
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:46,450
One day, maybe, you do me a favor.

334
00:16:49,686 --> 00:16:51,321
Let me know how it goes, will you?

335
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:54,591
Tell your dad to wear a tie.

336
00:16:55,643 --> 00:16:59,480
You're twitching, Archie. Which
means this must be serious.

337
00:16:59,483 --> 00:17:02,410
I think the same person who shot my dad

338
00:17:02,413 --> 00:17:04,594
may have murdered Ms. Grundy.

339
00:17:04,597 --> 00:17:06,088
My, my.

340
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:08,806
We've come a long way
since dances at the gym

341
00:17:08,808 --> 00:17:11,075
and varsity football
tryouts, haven't we?

342
00:17:11,942 --> 00:17:15,427
You were the first to know
anything about Jason's autopsy, Mom.

343
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,081
So, Archie's wondering if...

344
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,049
If I can get details
on Ms. Grundy's death

345
00:17:19,052 --> 00:17:20,986
and see if they line up
with the attack on Fred.

346
00:17:20,989 --> 00:17:24,421
It would be really helpful
to put Archie's mind at ease.

347
00:17:25,491 --> 00:17:28,197
Fine. I'll reach out
to my ghoulish friend.

348
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,427
- Thank you, Mrs. Cooper.
- Mm.

349
00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:31,995
- Thanks, Betty.
- Mm.

350
00:17:31,998 --> 00:17:33,705
I should go.

351
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:35,265
I'll call you, Arch.

352
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:39,970
Spreading ourself a little thin

353
00:17:39,972 --> 00:17:43,452
as the patron saint of lost
causes, aren't we, Betty?

354
00:17:43,455 --> 00:17:46,443
Oh, you can cross saving
Pop's off your list.

355
00:17:47,313 --> 00:17:48,579
Oh, haven't you heard?

356
00:17:48,582 --> 00:17:50,881
Pop Tate is selling
the Chock'lit Shoppe.

357
00:17:50,883 --> 00:17:52,583
What? To who?

358
00:17:52,586 --> 00:17:54,184
To, and you'll love this,

359
00:17:54,186 --> 00:17:55,719
an anonymous buyer.

360
00:17:56,522 --> 00:17:57,868
Ring any bells?

361
00:18:00,556 --> 00:18:02,826
Oh, Ms. Veronica. I'll
take those for you.

362
00:18:02,828 --> 00:18:04,896
Oh, thank you, Smithers.

363
00:18:04,899 --> 00:18:06,563
Hey, girl.

364
00:18:09,668 --> 00:18:10,968
What?

365
00:18:10,971 --> 00:18:12,767
Are you buying Pop's?

366
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,408
The way you bought the drive-in?

367
00:18:14,411 --> 00:18:15,610
Anonymously?

368
00:18:17,572 --> 00:18:19,739
And are you doing this just to buy me?

369
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,333
Yesterday, at school, did you think,

370
00:18:22,336 --> 00:18:25,329
"Oh, Veronica's working so hard
to save the Chock'lit Shoppe,

371
00:18:25,332 --> 00:18:26,868
I'll just save it for her!"

372
00:18:26,871 --> 00:18:29,419
Veronica, I'm not buying Pop's.

373
00:18:30,112 --> 00:18:33,080
Now, please, lower your voice and sit

374
00:18:34,047 --> 00:18:35,613
so we can speak civilly.

375
00:18:36,562 --> 00:18:38,128
Do you really want to talk, Dad?

376
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,963
That's all I've wanted. A fair hearing.

377
00:18:39,966 --> 00:18:41,698
To explain myself.

378
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:45,383
Okay.

379
00:18:46,178 --> 00:18:48,111
Let's talk about Mr. Andrews.

380
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:55,012
Mom asked him to sell his
portion of the SoDale project,

381
00:18:55,015 --> 00:18:58,015
and the day after he rejected the offer,

382
00:18:59,858 --> 00:19:02,192
he was shot in Pop's.

383
00:19:05,224 --> 00:19:06,690
Was it your doing?

384
00:19:06,693 --> 00:19:09,635
Veronica, first you accuse
me, then your father?

385
00:19:09,638 --> 00:19:11,762
No, no.

386
00:19:12,398 --> 00:19:13,997
I didn't shoot Fred.

387
00:19:14,767 --> 00:19:16,466
Nor did I hire someone to do it.

388
00:19:19,638 --> 00:19:22,239
I was your fiercest protector, Dad.

389
00:19:23,776 --> 00:19:25,009
Ask Mom.

390
00:19:25,012 --> 00:19:27,511
Whenever somebody called
you the devil incarnate,

391
00:19:27,513 --> 00:19:29,112
I defended you.

392
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,739
I kept telling myself,

393
00:19:31,742 --> 00:19:33,250
"He's not that bad.

394
00:19:34,386 --> 00:19:36,119
You can forgive him."

395
00:19:38,991 --> 00:19:40,490
And then you sent me this.

396
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,856
A letter threatening you, Mom.

397
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:04,868
That's the kind of man you're
letting back into our lives.

398
00:20:12,312 --> 00:20:13,645
Veronica?

399
00:20:15,463 --> 00:20:17,280
Your father didn't write this letter.

400
00:20:19,131 --> 00:20:20,731
I did.

401
00:20:23,802 --> 00:20:25,068
I don't understand.

402
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:27,971
I needed you to testify
on your father's behalf.

403
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:32,042
So I wrote this letter.
Threatening myself.

404
00:20:32,045 --> 00:20:33,445
Not your father.

405
00:20:34,546 --> 00:20:36,046
She did it for us.

406
00:20:36,982 --> 00:20:38,282
To survive.

407
00:20:39,051 --> 00:20:40,584
So we can be a family again.

408
00:20:43,856 --> 00:20:45,756
You two deserve each other.

409
00:20:52,932 --> 00:20:54,898
It's not exactly downsizing, is it?

410
00:20:57,226 --> 00:20:59,770
Hobo. Bride of Hobo.

411
00:20:59,773 --> 00:21:01,305
Welcome to Thistlehouse.

412
00:21:01,308 --> 00:21:03,134
Mother's in the conservatory.

413
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:04,537
Follow me.

414
00:21:12,618 --> 00:21:15,383
Thank you for sitting down with us.

415
00:21:15,393 --> 00:21:18,028
Of course, Betty. You're family.

416
00:21:20,171 --> 00:21:21,497
Okay.

417
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,262
The reason we're here...

418
00:21:25,265 --> 00:21:29,533
FP's lawyer thinks that
if the family of the victim

419
00:21:29,536 --> 00:21:31,086
shows mercy...

420
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:32,489
Mercy.

421
00:21:34,087 --> 00:21:35,653
That's why you're here?

422
00:21:37,209 --> 00:21:40,610
Well, it's an appeal
for leniency from you.

423
00:21:42,036 --> 00:21:43,736
To reduce my dad's sentence.

424
00:21:44,289 --> 00:21:46,941
Where was your father's mercy
when I spent those countless nights

425
00:21:46,944 --> 00:21:48,552
walking the halls of Thornhill in agony,

426
00:21:48,554 --> 00:21:50,587
obsessing over what was
happening to Jay-Jay?

427
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:51,890
Imagining the worst.

428
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,789
Where was your father's mercy

429
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,759
when I slept under the same
roof as a cold-blooded killer,

430
00:21:55,761 --> 00:21:56,960
night after night.

431
00:21:56,962 --> 00:21:58,328
Cheryl...

432
00:21:58,331 --> 00:22:00,640
FP didn't kill Jason.

433
00:22:01,378 --> 00:22:03,879
Okay? That was your dad.

434
00:22:03,882 --> 00:22:05,335
You saw the video.

435
00:22:05,338 --> 00:22:08,105
If it were up to me, I'd watch FP

436
00:22:08,107 --> 00:22:10,307
fry in the electric chair.

437
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:13,510
We need this sordid
chapter closed forever,

438
00:22:13,513 --> 00:22:16,046
and FP is the last loose end to tie up.

439
00:22:16,049 --> 00:22:19,149
I will not have a
living, breathing reminder

440
00:22:19,151 --> 00:22:20,584
of the darkest chapter of my life

441
00:22:20,586 --> 00:22:22,486
walking the streets of Riverdale.

442
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,668
What do we do now that
Cheryl's gone full Poison Ivy?

443
00:22:27,671 --> 00:22:30,109
Blackmail. Extortion.

444
00:22:31,367 --> 00:22:35,532
If they weren't weren't literally
an orphan and a widow, I would do it.

445
00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:47,015
Lacerations on the neck.
Her trachea's crushed.

446
00:22:47,018 --> 00:22:48,444
Broken veins in her eyes

447
00:22:48,447 --> 00:22:51,453
and the skin tears suggest brutality.

448
00:22:51,456 --> 00:22:53,550
This is a crime of passion.

449
00:22:53,553 --> 00:22:54,552
Hatred.

450
00:22:54,555 --> 00:22:57,501
He wanted to feel her
struggle as she died.

451
00:22:59,491 --> 00:23:02,259
Tell me, Mrs. Cooper,
did you know the victim?

452
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:04,463
No.

453
00:23:22,635 --> 00:23:23,934
Stop!

454
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:26,249
It's me.

455
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:28,856
Are you freakin' insane?

456
00:23:28,859 --> 00:23:30,369
What the hell are you
doing here, Reggie?

457
00:23:30,371 --> 00:23:33,743
Delivering your uppers,
clearly the last thing you need.

458
00:23:34,793 --> 00:23:36,559
You've lost it, Andrews.

459
00:23:36,562 --> 00:23:39,162
You're the one here wearing this hood.

460
00:23:39,164 --> 00:23:40,397
It's called a prank,

461
00:23:40,399 --> 00:23:42,367
I didn't expect you to attack me.

462
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:45,071
What if I had been the guy? Eh?

463
00:23:45,074 --> 00:23:47,752
You would have just tackled him?

464
00:23:47,755 --> 00:23:49,601
Yeah. Damn right.

465
00:23:49,604 --> 00:23:52,085
He has a gun, Andrews.

466
00:23:52,088 --> 00:23:54,262
He's shot people.

467
00:23:54,265 --> 00:23:57,447
Only a dumbass lunatic brings
a baseball bat to a gunfight.

468
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:05,160
There was no sign of forced entry,

469
00:24:05,163 --> 00:24:07,720
which probably means
she knew her killer.

470
00:24:07,723 --> 00:24:11,059
The police don't know if any of
her personal belongings were taken.

471
00:24:13,048 --> 00:24:14,447
How, uh...

472
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:17,150
How did Ms. Grundy die?

473
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:21,070
The autopsy showed
that she was strangled.

474
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:25,113
With something the
killer grabbed on hand.

475
00:24:26,061 --> 00:24:28,428
A cello bow, of all things.

476
00:24:31,566 --> 00:24:32,965
There was a struggle.

477
00:24:32,968 --> 00:24:34,906
She fought back.

478
00:24:34,909 --> 00:24:38,136
But, Archie, this was
a crime of passion,

479
00:24:38,139 --> 00:24:41,341
in another town with a completely
different murder weapon.

480
00:24:42,911 --> 00:24:46,270
The likelihood of these
two crimes being connected

481
00:24:46,273 --> 00:24:48,381
seems slim.

482
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,717
Son...

483
00:24:52,212 --> 00:24:54,880
If I say what I'm thinking,
you're just gonna think I'm crazy.

484
00:24:57,486 --> 00:24:59,119
Probably Mrs. Cooper's right.

485
00:25:00,828 --> 00:25:03,128
Probably they're not connected.

486
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:06,523
So, why'd you do it, Pop?

487
00:25:06,526 --> 00:25:08,484
Did they make you an
offer you couldn't refuse?

488
00:25:08,487 --> 00:25:10,023
Who's buying it? Do you even know?

489
00:25:10,026 --> 00:25:11,558
It shames me to say.

490
00:25:12,232 --> 00:25:13,508
ChugMo.

491
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:14,928
The liquor store chain?

492
00:25:16,177 --> 00:25:19,178
Hey, could I make a request
of you, Pop? For a last supper?

493
00:25:19,181 --> 00:25:20,480
Anything you want.

494
00:25:21,268 --> 00:25:23,715
Actually, it's not for
me, it's for my dad.

495
00:25:23,718 --> 00:25:26,016
He's facing 20 years

496
00:25:26,019 --> 00:25:28,798
of that weird meatloaf
that they serve prisoners.

497
00:25:28,801 --> 00:25:31,957
So, barring an
eleventh-hour miracle, I was

498
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,926
kind of hoping for his
last meal in Riverdale

499
00:25:33,928 --> 00:25:35,894
that you could make him his favorite.

500
00:25:35,897 --> 00:25:38,171
Fried chicken, cornbread, onion rings

501
00:25:38,174 --> 00:25:40,937
and an orange freeze, if memory serves.

502
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,046
It's very Rain Man of you, Pop.

503
00:25:43,049 --> 00:25:44,491
Been doing this a long time.

504
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:47,674
Thought I'd be doing
it until the day I die.

505
00:25:48,743 --> 00:25:50,543
This is...

506
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:52,612
Unacceptable.

507
00:25:54,841 --> 00:25:57,082
- What?
- Just everything.

508
00:25:57,085 --> 00:25:59,985
Pop, have you officially sold the diner?

509
00:25:59,988 --> 00:26:01,453
The contract's being drawn up.

510
00:26:01,456 --> 00:26:03,021
Do not sign it.

511
00:26:03,024 --> 00:26:05,590
Okay? Do not give up. Either of you.

512
00:26:05,593 --> 00:26:07,126
I can fix this, all right?

513
00:26:07,128 --> 00:26:08,727
I will fix this.

514
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:10,822
Okay? Bye.

515
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:26,158
Give a girl a warning, will you?

516
00:26:26,161 --> 00:26:28,111
You want closure, Cheryl.

517
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,167
I want to help my boyfriend's dad.

518
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:32,179
I already told you.

519
00:26:32,182 --> 00:26:33,986
And I'm telling you

520
00:26:33,989 --> 00:26:36,416
to help FP.

521
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:39,027
- Or...
- Or what?

522
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:42,972
Or I wide-release the video
of your father shooting Jason.

523
00:26:44,439 --> 00:26:47,355
Try having closure with
that out in the world.

524
00:26:49,653 --> 00:26:52,754
I thought you gave that damned
thumb drive to Sheriff Keller.

525
00:26:52,757 --> 00:26:55,875
No. Not before I saved a
copy onto Jughead's laptop.

526
00:26:57,525 --> 00:26:58,724
One click,

527
00:26:58,727 --> 00:27:03,716
and the darkest chapter of your
family's twisted psychodrama

528
00:27:03,718 --> 00:27:06,318
becomes a viral sensation.

529
00:27:06,321 --> 00:27:08,020
Are you threatening me?

530
00:27:10,124 --> 00:27:14,092
This? No.

531
00:27:14,095 --> 00:27:16,928
No, this is...

532
00:27:16,931 --> 00:27:19,071
Fun girl talk.

533
00:27:22,386 --> 00:27:25,172
You could save a man's life.

534
00:27:26,541 --> 00:27:28,040
Think about that.

535
00:27:29,242 --> 00:27:32,910
A nice ending to a sad story.

536
00:27:36,173 --> 00:27:37,906
If I testify,

537
00:27:37,909 --> 00:27:40,076
you're giving me that video.

538
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:42,555
And a guarantee that
any and all other copies

539
00:27:42,557 --> 00:27:44,659
in your possession will be erased.

540
00:27:45,994 --> 00:27:47,260
You have my word.

541
00:27:48,863 --> 00:27:50,296
Also,

542
00:27:51,365 --> 00:27:53,956
I need the Vixens. For Retro Night.

543
00:27:57,832 --> 00:28:00,253
You're a stone-cold
bitch, Betty Cooper.

544
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:12,440
I don't have red hair,

545
00:28:12,443 --> 00:28:14,219
nor broad shoulders,

546
00:28:14,222 --> 00:28:15,988
or a blonde ponytail, for that matter.

547
00:28:17,951 --> 00:28:19,417
Do you wanna talk?

548
00:28:25,633 --> 00:28:27,933
You were ready to walk away

549
00:28:27,936 --> 00:28:29,868
from your dad.

550
00:28:29,871 --> 00:28:34,306
And now, you're
crusading for his freedom.

551
00:28:34,309 --> 00:28:35,775
What changed?

552
00:28:37,712 --> 00:28:39,590
He did.

553
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:41,414
He made an effort.

554
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,411
Took another swing at being a good dad.

555
00:28:47,391 --> 00:28:48,924
But don't you think

556
00:28:49,836 --> 00:28:52,251
some people can't change?

557
00:28:52,254 --> 00:28:55,704
Like, it's just in their DNA to be bad?

558
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:00,903
I'm not gonna presume to know
what lies in your father's heart.

559
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:03,769
But Archie's dad almost died.

560
00:29:05,057 --> 00:29:08,358
And my dad is going away for 20 years.

561
00:29:10,008 --> 00:29:13,509
If there's even a .0001% chance

562
00:29:13,512 --> 00:29:15,837
- that your dad is trying...
- I get it.

563
00:29:18,501 --> 00:29:21,657
Thank you, Jughead.

564
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,201
Sheriff, I believe
the man who shot my dad

565
00:29:24,204 --> 00:29:26,025
is the same person
that killed Ms. Grundy.

566
00:29:26,028 --> 00:29:28,061
And I think I know who it is.

567
00:29:28,665 --> 00:29:31,438
You know, that's, uh... That's
quite a statement, Archie.

568
00:29:31,441 --> 00:29:34,132
Ms. Grundy had an abusive ex-husband.

569
00:29:34,135 --> 00:29:36,529
She moved to Riverdale
to get away from him.

570
00:29:36,532 --> 00:29:39,414
She kept a gun in her car
in case he'd ever come back.

571
00:29:39,417 --> 00:29:40,950
How do you know all this?

572
00:29:42,234 --> 00:29:44,634
Because she and I were...

573
00:29:47,165 --> 00:29:48,531
We were close.

574
00:29:48,534 --> 00:29:51,101
And I'm thinking...
He found out about me.

575
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:54,891
Ms. Grundy was killed with a cello bow.

576
00:29:54,894 --> 00:29:57,255
I gave her one before
she left Riverdale.

577
00:29:57,258 --> 00:29:59,291
I'm betting it's the murder weapon.

578
00:30:00,927 --> 00:30:02,960
Can't you see, he's
sending me a message.

579
00:30:02,963 --> 00:30:04,977
Your theory's wrong, Archie.

580
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,930
My counterparts in Greendale

581
00:30:06,933 --> 00:30:08,641
already brought in her ex.

582
00:30:08,644 --> 00:30:10,725
And he has an airtight alibi.

583
00:30:18,413 --> 00:30:20,146
Maybe everyone's right.

584
00:30:23,184 --> 00:30:25,284
Maybe I am going crazy.

585
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:34,869
Hey, has Betty called?

586
00:30:34,872 --> 00:30:39,344
Not yet. Let's pray Cheryl
comes through for them.

587
00:30:39,347 --> 00:30:41,964
Ms. Blossom, you may
proceed with your statement.

588
00:30:41,967 --> 00:30:46,672
Your Honor, I speak for
myself and my mother when I say

589
00:30:46,675 --> 00:30:49,123
we forgive FP Jones
for the part he played

590
00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:50,958
in covering up my brother's murder,

591
00:30:52,522 --> 00:30:55,089
and we humbly ask the
court for leniency.

592
00:30:57,008 --> 00:30:59,272
FP's guilt has been
blown out of proportion

593
00:30:59,275 --> 00:31:01,776
to satiate what my
father's suicide denied us.

594
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,592
Closure.

595
00:31:04,595 --> 00:31:06,840
As much as I sympathize,

596
00:31:06,843 --> 00:31:09,735
I can't ignore the quality
of Mr. Jones' crimes.

597
00:31:09,738 --> 00:31:12,508
There were no extenuating circumstances.

598
00:31:17,973 --> 00:31:20,065
My father threatened him.

599
00:31:20,068 --> 00:31:22,547
I overheard them
talking in Daddy's study.

600
00:31:23,805 --> 00:31:26,994
Daddy said he would hurt
Jughead if FP didn't comply.

601
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:32,805
Is that extenuating enough?

602
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:39,047
In light of these revelations,

603
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:42,001
I suggest that we take a step back

604
00:31:42,004 --> 00:31:44,888
and reevaluate certain
aspects of the case.

605
00:31:44,891 --> 00:31:48,649
At which time, we will
revisit the sentencing.

606
00:31:48,652 --> 00:31:50,085
Adjourned.

607
00:31:57,995 --> 00:31:59,528
Is that a win?

608
00:31:59,531 --> 00:32:01,966
It's a delay. So, yeah.

609
00:32:13,293 --> 00:32:14,459
No one's here.

610
00:32:15,515 --> 00:32:17,333
No one's coming.

611
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:19,446
It's still early, okay?

612
00:32:23,727 --> 00:32:25,360
Mom.

613
00:32:25,363 --> 00:32:27,278
What, did you come to gloat?

614
00:32:27,281 --> 00:32:29,197
Oh, don't be so cynical, Elizabeth.

615
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,283
I came to write my next story
over one last root beer float.

616
00:32:32,286 --> 00:32:34,953
I'm calling it "Requiem for Pop's."

617
00:32:34,956 --> 00:32:37,018
Can I get a quote, dear?

618
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:39,607
You're a fiend, Mother,

619
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:42,912
but this is one obituary
that you're not gonna write.

620
00:32:46,361 --> 00:32:49,448
All right, two strawberries,

621
00:32:49,451 --> 00:32:51,068
one vanilla,

622
00:32:51,071 --> 00:32:52,912
and one chocolate with extra malt.

623
00:32:58,381 --> 00:33:01,014
Why the hell did you broadcast
all over social media that

624
00:33:01,017 --> 00:33:04,725
the Pussycats would be doing
a free concert here tonight?

625
00:33:04,728 --> 00:33:07,027
I knew that if I asked
you, you would have said...

626
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:08,171
- No!
- Mmm-hmm.

627
00:33:08,174 --> 00:33:10,890
If my mom even hears that
I set foot in this place...

628
00:33:10,893 --> 00:33:13,694
Josie, you care about
this place, I know you do.

629
00:33:13,697 --> 00:33:16,030
I see you in here all the time.

630
00:33:16,033 --> 00:33:19,124
Betty, even if I wanted
to help, I'm down a cat.

631
00:33:19,135 --> 00:33:21,535
- Valerie has norovirus...
- I don't mind stepping in.

632
00:33:21,538 --> 00:33:23,944
After all, if you can be a River Vixen,

633
00:33:23,947 --> 00:33:25,313
Josie, I can be a Pussycat.

634
00:33:26,186 --> 00:33:28,624
As long as it's a cover, I'm
sure I'll know the lyrics.

635
00:33:28,627 --> 00:33:31,085
I mean, you do love your
cheese fries, Josie...

636
00:33:33,642 --> 00:33:35,208

- Hey.
- You made it.

653
00:34:32,394 --> 00:34:33,960
You feeling okay?

654
00:34:33,963 --> 00:34:36,730
Yeah. Just taking deep breaths.

655
00:34:37,594 --> 00:34:38,860
I'm proud of you.

656
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:44,144
Come on, you take a booth.

657
00:34:44,147 --> 00:34:46,159
And I'll get you a shake.

658
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:56,628
We're not here to fight,
we're here to be supportive.

659
00:34:56,631 --> 00:34:58,739
Dad, Mom.

660
00:34:58,742 --> 00:35:00,411
I've been thinking.

661
00:35:01,335 --> 00:35:04,064
Tonight is a new
beginning for Pop's. And...

662
00:35:04,067 --> 00:35:06,313
Maybe it can be for us, too.

663
00:35:06,797 --> 00:35:08,264
That's up to you, mija.

664
00:35:08,267 --> 00:35:09,850
If that's what you want.

665
00:35:09,852 --> 00:35:12,919
Let's try. But, you guys,

666
00:35:12,922 --> 00:35:15,902
total transparency, okay?

667
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,624
From now on.

668
00:35:17,627 --> 00:35:19,993
In the spirit of that, I propose that

669
00:35:19,995 --> 00:35:23,196
Lodge Industries make a
charitable contribution.

670
00:35:42,989 --> 00:35:44,322
Relax, Betty.

671
00:35:44,325 --> 00:35:45,992
I'm sure they're just here to enjoy

672
00:35:45,995 --> 00:35:48,929
Pop's world-class burgers and service.

673
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:51,992
Just like me.

674
00:35:51,995 --> 00:35:54,734
Ugh, you two are like
chimps in captivity,

675
00:35:54,737 --> 00:35:56,562
grooming and picking
lice off each other.

676
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,160
Mark this day in your diary.

677
00:35:59,163 --> 00:36:02,871
I lied under oath for you. And
thank God I'm quick on my feet.

678
00:36:02,874 --> 00:36:04,040
Cheryl,

679
00:36:05,871 --> 00:36:07,337
thank you.

680
00:36:09,126 --> 00:36:10,793
Honor your promise to me.

681
00:36:19,589 --> 00:36:20,522
Boo!

682
00:36:20,525 --> 00:36:22,453
Hi, Midge, Moose.

683
00:36:24,587 --> 00:36:26,287
I've got your jingle-jangle.

684
00:36:33,277 --> 00:36:35,644
I gotta put her on the spot.

685
00:36:35,647 --> 00:36:38,203
It's thanks to this young lady here

686
00:36:38,206 --> 00:36:41,411
that Pop's gets to stay
open tonight, tomorrow...

687
00:36:41,414 --> 00:36:43,877
As long as you folks keep coming.

688
00:36:48,036 --> 00:36:51,204
Thanks, also, to the Lodge family

689
00:36:51,207 --> 00:36:53,261
for a donation they just made

690
00:36:53,264 --> 00:36:54,964
that gives us a little cushion

691
00:36:54,967 --> 00:36:57,524
to weather any storm that might come up.

692
00:37:01,611 --> 00:37:03,411
I didn't know we were
in the charity business.

693
00:37:04,309 --> 00:37:05,709
Oh, we're not.

694
00:37:06,652 --> 00:37:10,026
As of five minutes ago,
we, uh, own this diner.

695
00:37:10,029 --> 00:37:14,352
In exchange for silence, I told
Tate he could stay on as manager.

696
00:37:16,645 --> 00:37:18,678
Nice to have you back, Hiram.

697
00:37:20,177 --> 00:37:22,836
Hermione, thank you for
saying you wrote that letter.

698
00:37:23,421 --> 00:37:25,521
Veronica never would
have forgiven me for that.

699
00:37:25,927 --> 00:37:29,024
Once again, your
loyalty knows no bounds.

700
00:37:35,342 --> 00:37:37,734
Ronnie, should I introduce
myself to your dad?

701
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,663
You've faced enough
dragons for one night.

702
00:37:40,666 --> 00:37:42,754
Next time, Archiekins.

703
00:37:42,757 --> 00:37:47,274
So, I guess tonight is
a win for the good guys.

704
00:37:48,155 --> 00:37:50,863
A rare win, but, yes.

705
00:37:50,866 --> 00:37:52,577
Thanks to you, Betty.

706
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,614
You okay?

707
00:37:56,417 --> 00:37:58,083
I'm here with you guys.

708
00:37:58,908 --> 00:38:00,808
So, yeah. I think so.

709
00:38:13,711 --> 00:38:16,478
I have a present for you.

710
00:38:20,384 --> 00:38:22,551
The video of Daddy and Jason.

711
00:38:26,256 --> 00:38:27,489
All cued up.

712
00:38:31,466 --> 00:38:33,199
It might bring you peace.

713
00:38:41,662 --> 00:38:43,960
Evening, Mr. and Mrs. Lodge.

714
00:38:43,963 --> 00:38:45,362
You must be Veronica.

715
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:47,449
I am. Where's Smithers?

716
00:38:47,452 --> 00:38:48,677
Oh, he didn't tell you?

717
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,996
His mother fell ill so he went
home overseas to care for her.

718
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:53,501
Did he leave a forwarding address?

719
00:38:53,504 --> 00:38:54,955
I'll try to track one down, sir.

720
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:56,457
Thank you, Andre.

721
00:39:10,733 --> 00:39:11,798
Hello?

722
00:39:11,801 --> 00:39:13,968
You went to see Penny Peabody?

723
00:39:13,971 --> 00:39:15,669
You asked her for help?

724
00:39:15,672 --> 00:39:17,699
Dad, hey...

725
00:39:17,702 --> 00:39:21,579
Yeah, well, we didn't have a
choice. Why, is something wrong?

726
00:39:21,582 --> 00:39:23,878
Did you pay her?

727
00:39:23,881 --> 00:39:25,447
No, she said it was a favor.

728
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:27,615
Jughead, listen to me.

729
00:39:27,618 --> 00:39:29,251
Do not contact her again.

730
00:39:29,254 --> 00:39:32,293
If she reaches out, don't respond.

731
00:39:32,296 --> 00:39:35,390
You do not want to be in
bed with the Snake Charmer.

732
00:39:35,392 --> 00:39:37,316
Why? Dad...

733
00:39:49,231 --> 00:39:53,307
You do know that several drug
deals went down here tonight.

734
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:54,676
What?

735
00:39:54,679 --> 00:39:56,379
And if you think that Hiram Lodge,

736
00:39:56,382 --> 00:39:58,082
Riverdale's answer to Scarface,

737
00:39:58,085 --> 00:40:00,413
helped Pop Tate for altruistic reasons,

738
00:40:00,416 --> 00:40:02,116
I have a bridge to sell you.

739
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:03,478
Mom...

740
00:40:03,481 --> 00:40:05,941
The Serpents have now
officially crossed the tracks

741
00:40:05,944 --> 00:40:07,710
and have a toehold on the north side.

742
00:40:07,713 --> 00:40:09,543
So, congratulations, Betty.

743
00:40:09,546 --> 00:40:11,848
You're almost single-handedly responsible

744
00:40:11,851 --> 00:40:14,168
for giving crime a haven in Riverdale.

745
00:40:18,341 --> 00:40:21,102
And far from the glow
of Pop's neon sign,

746
00:40:21,105 --> 00:40:23,316
on Sweetwater Bridge,

747
00:40:23,319 --> 00:40:26,128
Archie Andrews had
arranged a secret rendezvous

748
00:40:26,131 --> 00:40:28,031
with Dilton Doiley.

749
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,480
Hey, Dilton.

750
00:40:32,216 --> 00:40:33,882
Hey, Archie.

751
00:40:34,615 --> 00:40:35,981
Got what you asked for.

752
00:40:51,291 --> 00:40:52,523
I'm not crazy.

753
00:40:53,612 --> 00:40:56,667
The guy's still out there.
It's just for protection.

754
00:40:56,670 --> 00:41:00,761
Sure, Archie. Whatever you say.

755
00:41:00,764 --> 00:41:03,611
That night, for the first time in weeks,

756
00:41:03,614 --> 00:41:05,480
Archie would sleep.

757
00:41:07,073 --> 00:41:10,940
Before waking up the next
morning to a living nightmare.

758
00:41:10,943 --> 00:41:12,076
Bottoms up.

759
00:41:31,999 --> 00:41:33,398
Oh, wait, wait.

760
00:41:33,872 --> 00:41:35,977
I think there's somebody out there.

761
00:41:38,382 --> 00:41:40,544
No, don't. He'll see us.

762
00:41:54,773 --> 00:41:58,182
