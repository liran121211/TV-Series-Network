1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,252
Previously on Riverdale...

2
00:00:01,254 --> 00:00:02,419
Archie Andrews,

3
00:00:02,422 --> 00:00:04,796
I'm Special Agent Adams with the FBI.

4
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,622
We believe Hiram Lodge is
conducting criminal activity.

5
00:00:07,625 --> 00:00:10,401
You're in a unique position
to help us take him down.

6
00:00:10,404 --> 00:00:11,721
I need some assurance from you.

7
00:00:11,723 --> 00:00:13,258
That no matter what
happens to Mr. Lodge,

8
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,526
my dad is gonna be okay.

9
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:15,686
I can protect your father.

10
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:16,755
But effective immediately,

11
00:00:16,758 --> 00:00:19,228
Southside High School is shut down.

12
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:20,130
Well, it's done.

13
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:22,129
After a few weeks,
we'll quietly go about

14
00:00:22,132 --> 00:00:24,606
purchasing the land
beneath Southside High.

15
00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:26,554
And you'll get your sizable donation

16
00:00:26,557 --> 00:00:28,240
to your re-election campaign.

17
00:00:28,242 --> 00:00:29,723
Daddy, this is...

18
00:00:29,726 --> 00:00:30,895
Archie Andrews.

19
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:33,242
The boy who has captured
my daughter's heart.

20
00:00:33,245 --> 00:00:34,846
I hope we can respect each other.

21
00:00:34,848 --> 00:00:36,048
Of course, Mr. Lodge.

22
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,546
No more sneaking into
my daughter's bedroom.

23
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:39,848
Ever.

24
00:00:39,851 --> 00:00:42,098
You wanted me to get a
job, Cheryl, and I did.

25
00:00:42,101 --> 00:00:44,122
Providing comfort and companionship

26
00:00:44,124 --> 00:00:46,224
to the lonely men of Riverdale.

27
00:00:46,227 --> 00:00:49,031
You remember that baby my
mom put up for adoption?

28
00:00:49,034 --> 00:00:51,530
Hey! Let go of my brother.

29
00:00:51,533 --> 00:00:53,085
You'll be safe here.

30
00:00:57,765 --> 00:01:00,180
One week after Riverdale High's

31
00:01:00,183 --> 00:01:02,538
absorption of its Southside counterpart,

32
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,373
and everything was the same.

33
00:01:07,374 --> 00:01:09,307
And nothing was the same.

34
00:01:10,147 --> 00:01:11,680
Take Archie Andrews.

35
00:01:11,682 --> 00:01:14,316
On the surface, he's getting
ready for basketball tryouts,

36
00:01:14,318 --> 00:01:15,929
as he does every winter.

37
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,921
But underneath, he was churning,

38
00:01:18,923 --> 00:01:20,656
his life in chaos

39
00:01:20,658 --> 00:01:23,367
after an unexpected visit from the Feds.

40
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,895
Meanwhile, the town
was preparing to honor

41
00:01:25,898 --> 00:01:29,637
its founding father,
General Augustus Pickens.

42
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,388
Mr. Jones, eyes up front.

43
00:01:33,058 --> 00:01:34,524
Thank you, Mrs. Haggly.

44
00:01:36,164 --> 00:01:38,442
As I was saying,

45
00:01:38,445 --> 00:01:41,210
each year, we honor the
memory of General Pickens,

46
00:01:41,213 --> 00:01:43,875
yet few know the truth.

47
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:47,781
That it was my great-great-
great-grandpappy

48
00:01:47,784 --> 00:01:49,484
Colonel Barnabas B. Blossom,

49
00:01:49,487 --> 00:01:52,246
who bankrolled General
Pickens' settlement of,

50
00:01:52,249 --> 00:01:54,871
"...an Eden along the
river of Sweetwater,

51
00:01:54,874 --> 00:01:57,259
where maple trees grow
taller than the steeples

52
00:01:57,261 --> 00:01:59,094
of Europe's grandest cathedrals."

53
00:01:59,097 --> 00:02:01,597
Which is why every year I
petition the mayor's office

54
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:03,032
to rename Pickens Day.

55
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:06,903
Thank you for that, Cheryl.

56
00:02:07,672 --> 00:02:09,138
Mr. Jones,

57
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,153
we look forward to your oral
history report next week.

58
00:02:12,156 --> 00:02:15,265
The students we transferred
to Riverdale High are fine,

59
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:17,406
but their parents are in my office,

60
00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:20,171
every day, wanting me
to reopen Southside High.

61
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:23,618
Which is why we've been
discussing how our new neighborhood

62
00:02:23,621 --> 00:02:25,788
could use something
positive to focus on.

63
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:28,476
With your blessing, we'd
like to make Pickens Day

64
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:30,526
bigger, more of a celebratory event.

65
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,374
Sponsored by Lodge Industries.

66
00:02:32,377 --> 00:02:34,930
And Andrews Construction co-sponsoring.

67
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:36,999
You mean you wanna turn Pickens Day

68
00:02:37,001 --> 00:02:39,335
into a commercial for
your SoDale project

69
00:02:39,337 --> 00:02:40,970
like your open house?

70
00:02:40,973 --> 00:02:43,265
Au contraire, Madam Mayor.

71
00:02:43,268 --> 00:02:46,004
The open house was for investors,

72
00:02:46,007 --> 00:02:49,788
but this event would be for
North and Southsiders alike.

73
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,780
Two halves of a whole coming together...

74
00:02:51,782 --> 00:02:53,616
And trying to distract
people with a party?

75
00:02:53,618 --> 00:02:55,417
What if it backfires
and things get violent?

76
00:02:55,419 --> 00:02:56,760
No. What about the Serpents?

77
00:02:56,763 --> 00:02:58,844
They've been quiet lately,
but they're wild cards

78
00:02:58,847 --> 00:03:00,927
- and they could cause trouble.
- We've thought of that.

79
00:03:00,929 --> 00:03:03,395
And so we've offered to hire
them as security for the event.

80
00:03:03,398 --> 00:03:05,694
Fred, you're on board with this?

81
00:03:05,697 --> 00:03:07,942
FP told me the Serpents
are looking for work,

82
00:03:07,945 --> 00:03:10,231
figured we'd let 'em keep the peace.

83
00:03:10,234 --> 00:03:12,935
I'm sure you had your reasons
for closing down Southside High,

84
00:03:12,937 --> 00:03:15,838
but this is an opportunity
to let the Southside know

85
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,567
that you're not turning
your back on them.

86
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:18,603
Hey, Dad.

87
00:03:18,606 --> 00:03:19,540
Hey, bud.

88
00:03:19,543 --> 00:03:20,744
Archie.

89
00:03:20,747 --> 00:03:22,277
Sorry to interrupt.

90
00:03:22,279 --> 00:03:23,412
Mind if I join you guys?

91
00:03:23,415 --> 00:03:26,322
- Actually, we were just finishing up.
- Mmm-hmm.

92
00:03:26,325 --> 00:03:28,050
Thanks, Fred, for having us.

93
00:03:28,053 --> 00:03:31,072
Madam Mayor, you'll let
us know in the morning?

94
00:03:31,075 --> 00:03:32,821
Hey, Mr. Lodge.

95
00:03:32,824 --> 00:03:34,289
Excuse me, Archie.

96
00:03:37,972 --> 00:03:39,037
Hey.

97
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,897
Oh, um, I'd kiss you, but you're sweaty.

98
00:03:43,367 --> 00:03:46,735
So, how long do you plan
on staying with us, Chic?

99
00:03:46,738 --> 00:03:48,231
For as long as he wants.

100
00:03:48,234 --> 00:03:51,080
I'm just trying to plan my life, Alice.

101
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:55,277
And since we're not getting
any answers about anything...

102
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,965
What would you like to know, Hal?

103
00:03:56,968 --> 00:03:59,778
For starters, Betty
brought you here all bloody.

104
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,250
Why? What happened?

105
00:04:01,253 --> 00:04:02,352
Dad.

106
00:04:02,355 --> 00:04:04,386
You don't have to, Chic.

107
00:04:05,756 --> 00:04:08,822
The person who attacked
me, his name's Marcel.

108
00:04:08,825 --> 00:04:10,225
He runs the hostel.

109
00:04:10,228 --> 00:04:12,775
Sometimes, he books clients for us.

110
00:04:12,778 --> 00:04:16,065
The night you showed up, Betty,
I wasn't in the mood to work.

111
00:04:16,067 --> 00:04:18,233
Marcel was trying to
convince me otherwise.

112
00:04:18,236 --> 00:04:20,715
So, what, uh... what kind of clients?

113
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:21,770
Hal!

114
00:04:21,772 --> 00:04:23,839
- No, I wanna know, too.
- Betty.

115
00:04:23,842 --> 00:04:25,140
All kinds.

116
00:04:25,143 --> 00:04:28,408
Ranging from nice to, hell,
even nastier than Marcel.

117
00:04:28,411 --> 00:04:31,914
I can go into specifics if you'd like.

118
00:04:31,917 --> 00:04:34,833
I've also got a pretty good
collection of scars I could show you.

119
00:04:34,836 --> 00:04:36,747
I have scars, too.

120
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,954
Crescent moons on my palms.

121
00:04:38,957 --> 00:04:40,853
From digging your nails in.

122
00:04:40,856 --> 00:04:43,459
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I used to do that, too.

123
00:04:45,563 --> 00:04:46,595
Syrup.

124
00:04:50,935 --> 00:04:53,135
If and when the US government

125
00:04:53,137 --> 00:04:55,637
brings actions against Hiram Lodge

126
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:57,673
before any domestic court of law,

127
00:04:57,676 --> 00:05:00,342
that agreement ensures
your father's immunity.

128
00:05:00,344 --> 00:05:01,458
This is nuts.

129
00:05:01,461 --> 00:05:03,679
The Lodges were just at
my house planning a party.

130
00:05:03,681 --> 00:05:05,280
When was this? Who was there?

131
00:05:05,283 --> 00:05:06,616
Last night.

132
00:05:06,619 --> 00:05:10,018
And it was Mr. And Mrs. Lodge,
my dad, the sheriff, Mayor McCoy.

133
00:05:11,489 --> 00:05:12,588
That's it.

134
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,889
Why weren't you a part of this?

135
00:05:13,892 --> 00:05:15,333
Because I was playing basketball.

136
00:05:15,336 --> 00:05:17,911
Agent Adams, what can
we do to speed things up?

137
00:05:17,914 --> 00:05:20,162
I just... I wanna get through this

138
00:05:20,165 --> 00:05:21,958
and back to my life, my normal life.

139
00:05:21,961 --> 00:05:24,867
Do you have any relationship with
Hiram Lodge, directly with him?

140
00:05:26,294 --> 00:05:28,504
Nothing. He doesn't even like me.

141
00:05:28,507 --> 00:05:30,005
Then let's change that.

142
00:05:30,008 --> 00:05:31,536
You have to establish trust.

143
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,567
Get him to lower his guard around you.

144
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,848
The sooner you get access
to his inner circle,

145
00:05:35,851 --> 00:05:38,647
the sooner we'll get what
we need to bring him in.

146
00:05:38,649 --> 00:05:39,882
And then, you can go back

147
00:05:39,884 --> 00:05:42,317
to playing in the band
with your pals 'n' gals.

148
00:05:45,956 --> 00:05:49,533
Well, he's very fetching for
someone who was living on Skid Row.

149
00:05:49,536 --> 00:05:53,295
Yeah, he's a hottie who looks
incredibly familiar to me, by the way.

150
00:05:53,298 --> 00:05:54,551
Your adventures in the woods?

151
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:57,832
I don't know, but maybe if we were
allowed to meet this hottie in person...

152
00:05:57,835 --> 00:05:59,535
Chic's still acclimating.

153
00:05:59,538 --> 00:06:01,058
And I'm trying to get him to trust me,

154
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:03,672
but my mom is treating him
like he's a ten-year-old

155
00:06:03,674 --> 00:06:06,286
and my dad's acting like
he's the devil's spawn.

156
00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:08,434
Well, I have an amazing idea.

157
00:06:08,437 --> 00:06:11,279
Bring The Omen to Pickens
Day and we can all meet him.

158
00:06:11,282 --> 00:06:12,481
Everyone's coming, right?

159
00:06:12,483 --> 00:06:14,249
No, because the
Serpents weren't invited.

160
00:06:14,251 --> 00:06:16,451
The Serpents were
specifically asked to come.

161
00:06:16,454 --> 00:06:18,654
Yeah, to provide security.

162
00:06:18,657 --> 00:06:20,463
It's like we're all on
the Snowpiercer train,

163
00:06:20,466 --> 00:06:22,661
but the Serpents happen to be
the ones eating the cockroaches.

164
00:06:22,663 --> 00:06:24,823
You don't have to work
if you don't want to.

165
00:06:24,826 --> 00:06:28,176
The damage, as they say,
has already been done.

166
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,676
Talk to you guys later.

167
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:31,251
Plans with Toni?

168
00:06:31,254 --> 00:06:33,502
Uh, yeah, I'm interviewing
her grandfather

169
00:06:33,504 --> 00:06:35,304
for my oral history report.

170
00:06:35,306 --> 00:06:37,172
The oldest living Serpent.

171
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,413
Archie, what is it?

172
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:47,102
Look, I feel stupid
even talking about this,

173
00:06:47,105 --> 00:06:49,952
but... it's about your dad.

174
00:06:51,322 --> 00:06:53,755
I kind of get the feeling
he doesn't really like me.

175
00:06:53,758 --> 00:06:54,990
What?

176
00:06:56,126 --> 00:06:59,394
No, that's not... That's not true.

177
00:07:01,298 --> 00:07:02,865
Okay, maybe it's a little true,

178
00:07:02,867 --> 00:07:04,800
but it's not anything
you're doing, per se,

179
00:07:04,802 --> 00:07:06,735
it's more that...

180
00:07:06,737 --> 00:07:09,204
Well, for starters,
you don't speak Spanish.

181
00:07:09,206 --> 00:07:11,039
I can drop French and
start taking Spanish.

182
00:07:12,042 --> 00:07:14,158
This is really bothering you, isn't it?

183
00:07:14,161 --> 00:07:15,777
To be honest, yeah.

184
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:18,447
Do you have any suggestions
on what I can do?

185
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,377
To endear yourself to Daddy?

186
00:07:23,888 --> 00:07:27,637
Well, now that we're talking about it.

187
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,333
What, your dad likes wrestling?

188
00:07:29,336 --> 00:07:31,126
He was captain of Riverdale High's

189
00:07:31,128 --> 00:07:33,134
wrestling team back in the day.

190
00:07:33,137 --> 00:07:34,876
Says it changed his life.

191
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:37,676
Now that the season's
starting back up, it's like

192
00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:40,590
my mom and I are background
extras in the movie Foxcatcher.

193
00:07:41,538 --> 00:07:43,438
Wrestling? Really?

194
00:07:43,441 --> 00:07:46,262
Lodge Industries basically
bankrolls the team.

195
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:47,976
He was just talking to his old coach

196
00:07:47,978 --> 00:07:50,078
asking if he could sit in on tryouts.

197
00:07:51,482 --> 00:07:53,649
God, Ronnie, you know
what's super weird?

198
00:07:53,651 --> 00:07:55,751
I was just telling Reggie
how I was gonna take a break

199
00:07:55,753 --> 00:07:57,619
from basketball this
year to try something new.

200
00:07:57,621 --> 00:08:00,422
It would absolutely score
you some points with my dad.

201
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,305
Thanks again for meeting with me.

202
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:07,429
Toni told me that you're one of the
founding members of the Serpents.

203
00:08:07,432 --> 00:08:09,197
Yes. The snake, the laws,

204
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,233
it's all based on Uktena tradition.

205
00:08:12,603 --> 00:08:15,704
Who were the Uktena?

206
00:08:15,707 --> 00:08:17,339
Uktena is a serpent,

207
00:08:17,341 --> 00:08:19,947
a horned serpent, a water serpent.

208
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,677
Before there was a Riverdale,

209
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,993
all this land belonged to the Uktena.

210
00:08:23,996 --> 00:08:26,059
How did the Uktena
evolve into the Serpents?

211
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:31,019
The Uktena, we didn't evolve.

212
00:08:31,789 --> 00:08:33,221
We were all slaughtered.

213
00:08:34,224 --> 00:08:36,792
When my grandpa was a
baby, there was a raid,

214
00:08:36,795 --> 00:08:40,162
and it was led by your hero
over there, General Pickens.

215
00:08:40,165 --> 00:08:42,738
The battle, if you
want to call it that...

216
00:08:44,601 --> 00:08:46,673
only lasted for 12 minutes,

217
00:08:46,676 --> 00:08:50,005
but the slaughter was total and savage.

218
00:08:50,008 --> 00:08:52,111
The General Pickens...

219
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:54,879
whose statue stands
proudly in Pickens Park?

220
00:08:54,882 --> 00:08:56,844
Yes, and every year the Northside

221
00:08:56,847 --> 00:08:59,153
honors this man who massacred children.

222
00:08:59,156 --> 00:09:00,723
When my grandpa died,

223
00:09:00,726 --> 00:09:03,819
we formed the Serpents as a
way to keep the family together.

224
00:09:03,821 --> 00:09:05,420
How do people not know about this?

225
00:09:05,423 --> 00:09:07,158
Well, some do, but...

226
00:09:07,161 --> 00:09:10,692
It's called the whitewashing
of history, Jones.

227
00:09:11,395 --> 00:09:14,229
What, did you think Jason
Blossom was the first person

228
00:09:14,231 --> 00:09:15,731
to be murdered in Riverdale?

229
00:09:19,937 --> 00:09:21,333
You know I'm down to help,

230
00:09:21,336 --> 00:09:25,470
but why can't it just be the two
of us singing a duet at Pickens Day?

231
00:09:25,473 --> 00:09:26,794
I mean it could be,

232
00:09:26,797 --> 00:09:29,177
but the Pussycats are a brand.

233
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,679
Why let it sit fallow?

234
00:09:33,117 --> 00:09:34,983
Josie. Veronica.

235
00:09:34,986 --> 00:09:36,418
What's this all about?

236
00:09:37,239 --> 00:09:40,455
We are bringing back the
Pussycats to play Pickens Day.

237
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:41,994
And whose idea was that?

238
00:09:41,997 --> 00:09:43,923
Uh, it was Veronica's.

239
00:09:43,926 --> 00:09:46,295
Weren't we focusing on your solo career?

240
00:09:46,298 --> 00:09:49,458
We could bill it as a
special event, one night only.

241
00:09:49,461 --> 00:09:50,958
I was talking to my daughter.

242
00:09:52,102 --> 00:09:54,836
In fact, why don't we continue
this conversation later

243
00:09:54,838 --> 00:09:56,304
when it's just the two of us?

244
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,934
Hey, Kev, what's up?

245
00:10:05,937 --> 00:10:07,870
Are you somewhere secure
where you can talk?

246
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:09,067
Yeah, why, what is it?

247
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:11,219
Betty, I... I just remembered
where I know Chic from.

248
00:10:11,221 --> 00:10:14,322
He's a video gigolo, a
webcam boy, a cyber-trick.

249

250
00:10:34,518 --> 00:10:36,616
Mom...

251
00:10:36,619 --> 00:10:38,988
a really weird thing happened

252
00:10:38,991 --> 00:10:40,838
when I was at Josie's last night.

253
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:43,425
Mayor McCoy was acting
like I was a bad seed,

254
00:10:43,427 --> 00:10:45,094
out to corrupt her daughter.

255
00:10:45,097 --> 00:10:47,463
I don't believe Sierra is comfortable

256
00:10:47,466 --> 00:10:50,228
with how we've let you become
involved in the family business.

257
00:10:50,231 --> 00:10:51,846
Why does she even care?

258
00:10:51,849 --> 00:10:53,653
Maybe she's afraid
you're gonna tell Josie.

259
00:10:53,656 --> 00:10:55,814
- I would never.
- Of course not, mija.

260
00:10:56,741 --> 00:10:59,108
And I'm not making excuses for Sierra.

261
00:11:00,578 --> 00:11:02,311
In fact,

262
00:11:02,314 --> 00:11:04,346
should her coldness persist,

263
00:11:05,216 --> 00:11:07,116
I'll happily have a
conversation with her.

264
00:11:19,864 --> 00:11:21,584
I thought basketball was your sport.

265
00:11:22,633 --> 00:11:24,507
- I'm branching out.
- Ah.

266
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,502
What are you doing here, Mr. Lodge?

267
00:11:26,505 --> 00:11:28,537
Just checking out the team.

268
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,139
You know, I wrestled in high school.

269
00:11:30,141 --> 00:11:31,807
Really? No, I didn't know that.

270
00:11:31,809 --> 00:11:33,142
What weight class are you in?

271
00:11:33,145 --> 00:11:35,291
175, but I'm trying to get down to 170.

272
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:38,489
Hey, Andrews. It's a good thing
you're not in my weight class.

273
00:11:38,492 --> 00:11:40,252
I'd wreck you, Gingerbread Man.

274
00:11:43,855 --> 00:11:45,521
Let's bring it in.

275
00:11:49,093 --> 00:11:51,060
Firstly, I want to thank a gentleman

276
00:11:51,062 --> 00:11:54,096
who's really showing his
support for the team this year.

277
00:11:54,099 --> 00:11:56,921
He wrestled for me my
first year as coach.

278
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:59,835
That is Hiram "The Ram" Lodge.

279
00:11:59,838 --> 00:12:02,143
Guys, let's show him some appreciation.

280
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:10,479
Now listen up.

281
00:12:10,482 --> 00:12:12,533
Not everyone's gonna
make the team this year.

282
00:12:12,536 --> 00:12:15,088
There'll be cuts every day, boys,

283
00:12:15,091 --> 00:12:17,236
so make each match count.

284
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:19,187
All right. Pair off.

285
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,949
Up and downs. Let's go.

286
00:12:22,893 --> 00:12:26,161
Archie. You do know wrestling's not
like football or basketball, right?

287
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:28,831
I went up against Moose
in the Oklahoma Drill, Kev,

288
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,232
I'm good.

289
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:44,146
Thatta boy.

290
00:12:44,823 --> 00:12:46,889
Okay, reset. Again.

291
00:12:59,315 --> 00:13:01,782
It felt so good, Betty.

292
00:13:01,785 --> 00:13:04,900
It's like, yeah, Archie, you have
the physique of a 1970s porn star,

293
00:13:04,902 --> 00:13:06,401
but that doesn't mean you can wrestle.

294
00:13:06,403 --> 00:13:07,869
Speaking of porn stars...

295
00:13:07,872 --> 00:13:10,405
Did you get lost down a
webcam rabbit hole last night?

296
00:13:10,407 --> 00:13:13,075
It's... fascinating.

297
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:15,544
I brought Chic home to help my mom

298
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:16,778
without knowing who he was,

299
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:20,749
and now to find out he's
actually multiple people,

300
00:13:20,751 --> 00:13:22,844
performing online.

301
00:13:22,847 --> 00:13:24,586
How do I broach that with him?

302
00:13:24,588 --> 00:13:26,088
Do I broach that with him?

303
00:13:27,325 --> 00:13:29,024
Hey, am I interrupting?

304
00:13:29,027 --> 00:13:30,726
- Yeah, kinda...
- No.

305
00:13:30,729 --> 00:13:32,813
I just wanted to run some stuff
by you, but I can come back.

306
00:13:32,815 --> 00:13:34,121
No, no, no, it's fine.

307
00:13:36,667 --> 00:13:41,128
By the way, I'm really digging
Kevin's new gossip column.

308
00:13:41,131 --> 00:13:42,797
Readers love it.

309
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,208
And I needed to fill the
extra space when you...

310
00:13:47,144 --> 00:13:48,877
I'm actually working
on a story right now.

311
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:50,412
Here.

312
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:52,781
When I interviewed Toni's
grandfather for history class,

313
00:13:52,783 --> 00:13:54,650
he had some pretty intense things to say

314
00:13:54,652 --> 00:13:56,329
about General Pickens.

315
00:13:56,332 --> 00:13:58,380
But then I did some follow-up research.

316
00:13:58,383 --> 00:14:01,043
General Pickens was hired
by Barnabas B.s lossom

317
00:14:01,046 --> 00:14:03,392
to remove the Uktena tribe by force.

318
00:14:03,395 --> 00:14:05,500
Betty, he killed

319
00:14:05,503 --> 00:14:08,764
400 innocent men, women and children.

320
00:14:08,767 --> 00:14:10,299
Oh, my God! That's horrible.

321
00:14:10,301 --> 00:14:11,633
And adding salt to the wound,

322
00:14:11,635 --> 00:14:13,702
the last remnants of
the tribe, the Serpents,

323
00:14:13,704 --> 00:14:15,537
are being squeezed out of existence.

324
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:17,706
Toni's grandfather lives in a trailer

325
00:14:17,709 --> 00:14:19,347
the size of a broom closet.

326
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,443
And Hiram Lodge is
honoring this murderer

327
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:22,711
instead of trying to make amends.

328
00:14:22,713 --> 00:14:25,347
I think it's a story we need to tell.

329
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:29,758
Are you gonna try to get
a quote from Hiram Lodge?

330
00:14:29,761 --> 00:14:31,741
Kevin told me what happened.

331
00:14:35,652 --> 00:14:36,751
You okay?

332
00:14:36,754 --> 00:14:39,274
I'm fine. A bruised
ego more than anything.

333
00:14:39,277 --> 00:14:41,675
But Kevin's gonna work
with me, get me up to speed.

334
00:14:41,678 --> 00:14:42,744
Great.

335
00:14:43,339 --> 00:14:46,374
But should you not be
a natural-born wrestler,

336
00:14:46,377 --> 00:14:49,958
I thought of another way you
might curry my father's favor.

337
00:14:49,961 --> 00:14:53,375
Though Pickens Day is taking a back
seat to his wrestling obsession,

338
00:14:53,378 --> 00:14:54,776
he will be there.

339
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:58,753
And I suspect he'd be tickled to
see you singing with me and Josie.

340
00:15:06,718 --> 00:15:08,250
Chic, hey.

341
00:15:08,253 --> 00:15:09,758
He threw out my stuff!

342
00:15:09,761 --> 00:15:11,401
What, who did? What stuff?

343
00:15:11,404 --> 00:15:14,096
Marcel, my landlord, the guy you maced?

344
00:15:14,098 --> 00:15:16,898
He got rid of everything.
Everything I need to survive.

345
00:15:16,901 --> 00:15:18,667
My laptop, my camera.

346
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:19,901
Wait. You went back there

347
00:15:19,903 --> 00:15:22,104
and talked to him after
what he was doing to you?

348
00:15:22,107 --> 00:15:24,191
My entire life was at that hostel.

349
00:15:24,194 --> 00:15:26,441
Like my mom said, you can
stay here as long you want.

350
00:15:26,443 --> 00:15:28,277
You don't think this
is long-term, do you?

351
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:30,412
I don't know, maybe it can be.

352
00:15:30,415 --> 00:15:33,949
Wow. Wow. If you believe that,

353
00:15:33,951 --> 00:15:35,851
then you're even crazier than I thought.

354
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,738
This is Hiram.

355
00:15:44,741 --> 00:15:48,688
Hi, Mr. Lodge? Yeah,
this is Jughead Jones.

356
00:15:48,691 --> 00:15:51,033
I'm writing an article
about how General Pickens

357
00:15:51,036 --> 00:15:53,808
massacred the Uktena tribe and
stole the land you're building on.

358
00:16:53,277 --> 00:16:55,441
I'm sorry he sold all your stuff.

359
00:17:07,545 --> 00:17:10,512
♪ Can you hear me? ♪

360
00:17:12,163 --> 00:17:15,384
♪ Am I drowned out In the crowd ♪

361
00:17:15,386 --> 00:17:16,589
♪ Are you... ♪

362
00:17:16,592 --> 00:17:17,927
Hey.

363
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:20,297
What are you guys doing in here?

364
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,258
We're just working on
some Pickens Day songs.

365
00:17:23,261 --> 00:17:24,754
Archie's agreed to help.

366
00:17:24,757 --> 00:17:26,628
Yeah, but we can take
it to the living room...

367
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,829
No, no.

368
00:17:28,699 --> 00:17:29,977
Not at all.

369
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,768
I have to say, the thought of you two

370
00:17:32,771 --> 00:17:36,304
being in here alone
used to upset me deeply.

371
00:17:36,307 --> 00:17:38,699
But after seeing your
performance today, Archie,

372
00:17:38,702 --> 00:17:40,529
for some reason I'm less worried.

373
00:17:40,532 --> 00:17:42,243
Daddy, be nice.

374
00:17:42,246 --> 00:17:43,478
Not everyone can wrestle.

375
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,813
It takes a certain kind of man.

376
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:46,214
Excuse me, "man"?

377
00:17:46,224 --> 00:17:51,243
My point is there's no shame,
Archie, in admitting defeat.

378
00:17:51,246 --> 00:17:54,062
And accepting the fact that
you're more suited to...

379
00:17:54,065 --> 00:17:55,791
singing with the Pussycats.

380
00:17:55,794 --> 00:17:56,860
Daddy...

381
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,729
Archie may not be a star wrestler yet,

382
00:18:00,731 --> 00:18:04,099
but he's an incredible musician.

383
00:18:04,102 --> 00:18:07,803
And bonus for me, incredibly
sexy when he sings.

384
00:18:09,907 --> 00:18:11,106
Thanks, babe.

385
00:18:12,735 --> 00:18:14,235
Ah.

386
00:18:19,753 --> 00:18:21,616
But on second thought,
maybe I shouldn't be

387
00:18:21,618 --> 00:18:23,518
spreading myself too thin these days.

388
00:18:24,332 --> 00:18:25,554
Honestly?

389
00:18:25,557 --> 00:18:27,122
Yeah, I should get home,

390
00:18:27,124 --> 00:18:29,290
practice some moves Kevin showed me.

391
00:18:29,293 --> 00:18:32,727
But I'll see you at tryouts
tomorrow, I hope, Mr. Lodge?

392
00:18:34,136 --> 00:18:35,502
Yeah.

393
00:18:41,775 --> 00:18:43,708
Do you know who used to sit there?

394
00:18:43,711 --> 00:18:44,876
Dad...

395
00:18:44,879 --> 00:18:47,093
Our daughter, Polly.

396
00:18:47,096 --> 00:18:50,441
You sit in her chair,
you sleep in her bed.

397
00:18:50,444 --> 00:18:51,883
You're filling a void.

398
00:18:52,702 --> 00:18:55,491
That's the reason you're
here, the only reason.

399
00:18:56,456 --> 00:18:57,622
It's okay.

400
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,090
It doesn't bother me.

401
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,227
Everyone needs something, right?

402
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:05,975
And I don't expect
to stay here for free.

403
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,732
I never have.

404
00:19:13,751 --> 00:19:17,241
We're focusing on fundamentals today.

405
00:19:17,244 --> 00:19:19,778
Starting with the fireman's carry.

406
00:19:19,781 --> 00:19:23,249
And since it was his
signature move back in the day,

407
00:19:23,252 --> 00:19:26,147
I've asked Hiram Lodge
here to demonstrate.

408
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,913
Ram, will you do us the honor?

409
00:19:30,597 --> 00:19:33,532
All right, then. I need a volunteer.

410
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:38,596
Archie Andrews.

411
00:19:41,234 --> 00:19:42,667
Come on.

412
00:19:47,407 --> 00:19:49,808
- What are you waiting for?
- Mr. Lodge?

413
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,671
Come at me. Come on.

414
00:19:59,652 --> 00:20:02,210
This is a simple but effective move

415
00:20:02,213 --> 00:20:04,163
when your opponent gets cocky.

416
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:06,456
Dominating your rival,

417
00:20:06,459 --> 00:20:08,121
demoralizing him,

418
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:10,829
is the key if you want to win.

419
00:20:11,966 --> 00:20:13,898
Get the message?

420
00:20:13,901 --> 00:20:16,900
I always win.

421
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:22,073
"General Pickens was a murderer...

422
00:20:22,076 --> 00:20:24,375
and ripples from his gruesome acts

423
00:20:24,377 --> 00:20:26,132
continue to be felt today.

424
00:20:26,135 --> 00:20:27,645
Descendants of the victims

425
00:20:27,647 --> 00:20:29,808
are still being displaced.

426
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,632
So I challenge the Northside,

427
00:20:31,635 --> 00:20:34,858
instead of honoring men like
General Pickens and Hiram Lodge,

428
00:20:34,861 --> 00:20:36,321
hold them accountable.

429
00:20:36,324 --> 00:20:39,350
Reparations must be paid
to men like Thomas Topaz,

430
00:20:39,353 --> 00:20:41,593
who are too old and beaten down

431
00:20:41,595 --> 00:20:43,394
to fight back for themselves."

432
00:20:43,397 --> 00:20:44,829
This town is messed up,

433
00:20:44,831 --> 00:20:46,379
and it needs to own up to its history.

434
00:20:46,382 --> 00:20:49,901
My grandfather isn't some
broken-down victim, okay?

435
00:20:49,903 --> 00:20:53,872
Or some prop for your insane
vendetta against the Northside.

436
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,206
No, of course not.

437
00:20:55,209 --> 00:20:56,741
Look, I get it.

438
00:20:58,044 --> 00:20:59,677
You hate the Northside.

439
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,047
You hate that instead of
inviting you to a party,

440
00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:04,957
they asked you to work it.

441
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,784
It triggers all your rage

442
00:21:06,786 --> 00:21:09,687
about being born on the wrong
side of the tracks. But this?

443
00:21:12,743 --> 00:21:14,542
This wasn't your story to tell.

444
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,604
I can't cancel Pickens Day,

445
00:21:26,607 --> 00:21:28,382
but I don't want you performing at it.

446
00:21:28,385 --> 00:21:30,508
Not with the town riled
up over this article.

447
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,655
What if there's a riot?

448
00:21:31,658 --> 00:21:34,779
No one's rioting, Mom,
and I promised Veronica.

449
00:21:34,782 --> 00:21:36,147
Okay, well, I'm sorry.

450
00:21:36,149 --> 00:21:38,347
You can tell her that the Pussycats

451
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,084
aren't hers to order around.

452
00:21:40,093 --> 00:21:43,012
Why is Veronica triggering
you all of a sudden?

453
00:21:43,015 --> 00:21:46,556
Baby, let me tell you
something about Veronica...

454
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,892
and her parents

455
00:21:47,895 --> 00:21:50,262
and the way they do business.

456
00:21:50,265 --> 00:21:53,897
And the way they use their
daughter to do their business.

457
00:21:54,868 --> 00:21:58,272
♪ Nightshades on a warning ♪

458
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:02,605
♪ Give me strength Or
give me your light ♪

459
00:22:02,608 --> 00:22:06,644
♪ Give me anything Even sympathy ♪

460
00:22:06,647 --> 00:22:08,379
♪ There's a chance... ♪

461
00:22:09,215 --> 00:22:10,581
- You're late.
- I'm out.

462
00:22:10,584 --> 00:22:12,507
I'm not performing at Pickens Day.

463
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,374
Wait, what?

464
00:22:13,377 --> 00:22:16,996
It's just I don't like
being manipulated by a Lodge.

465
00:22:16,999 --> 00:22:18,155
What?

466
00:22:18,158 --> 00:22:20,625
Josie, is your mom making you do this?

467
00:22:21,127 --> 00:22:22,427
My mom?

468
00:22:23,495 --> 00:22:26,863
Whatever she and your
parents have going on,

469
00:22:26,866 --> 00:22:28,232
that's between them.

470
00:22:28,235 --> 00:22:29,968
She doesn't want me to be a part of it.

471
00:22:29,971 --> 00:22:32,858
My mom says that she may have
to do what your parents want,

472
00:22:32,861 --> 00:22:34,505
but I don't have to do what you want.

473
00:22:34,508 --> 00:22:35,707
What? Josie...

474
00:22:52,047 --> 00:22:54,140
The cameras aren't here, Jackie O.

475
00:22:54,143 --> 00:22:56,593
And what about Jughead's article?

476
00:22:56,596 --> 00:22:58,062
What about it, Cheryl?

477
00:22:58,065 --> 00:23:00,998
It says that Great-Great-
Great-Grandpappy Blossom

478
00:23:01,001 --> 00:23:03,935
hired General Pickens to
steal land from the Uktena.

479
00:23:03,938 --> 00:23:07,705
Well, how do you think we got
started in the maple syrup business?

480
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:08,907
Help me up.

481
00:23:13,103 --> 00:23:17,769
But then that means our
family is partly responsible

482
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:21,164
for killing literally
hundreds of people.

483
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:24,635
For what? A bunch of maple trees?

484
00:23:24,638 --> 00:23:26,593
It wasn't just trees.

485
00:23:26,596 --> 00:23:28,426
Dark, fertile earth.

486
00:23:28,429 --> 00:23:30,163
A mighty river.

487
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:33,858
Back in those early days,
we had a hand in everything.

488
00:23:33,861 --> 00:23:35,400
Building the railroads,

489
00:23:35,402 --> 00:23:37,734
operating the saloons

490
00:23:37,737 --> 00:23:39,816
and, yes, even a brothel.

491
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:42,040
The old ways die hard, it seems.

492
00:23:50,216 --> 00:23:52,136
You're definitely
getting better, Archie.

493
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,365
I appreciate the help.
Kevin. You're a legend.

494
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:57,320
Anytime. Can I ask you something?

495
00:23:57,323 --> 00:23:58,926
Why wrestling?

496
00:23:58,929 --> 00:24:01,766
Why now? I mean, you're
trying to impress Mr. Lodge?

497
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,282
To be honest, it didn't start there.

498
00:24:09,467 --> 00:24:10,667
But now...

499
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:14,238
Yeah, it's like there's nothing
I can do to earn his respect.

500
00:24:14,241 --> 00:24:16,040
And the more he looks down on me,

501
00:24:16,042 --> 00:24:18,242
the more I want to show
him that he's wrong.

502
00:24:21,314 --> 00:24:24,515
Yeah, it's personal now.

503
00:24:25,418 --> 00:24:27,350
Why'd you buy me that laptop?

504
00:24:27,353 --> 00:24:29,936
Oh, um, I didn't.

505
00:24:29,939 --> 00:24:33,097
It was just an old computer
I had from The Register.

506
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,626
Why'd you come back to get me?

507
00:24:36,329 --> 00:24:37,710
You're my brother.

508
00:24:40,233 --> 00:24:42,340
And my mom was depressed.

509
00:24:42,343 --> 00:24:45,636
No. Sorry, everything is a transaction.

510
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,460
No one, not even you, is that nice.

511
00:24:49,463 --> 00:24:51,776
So why do you care, Betty?

512
00:24:51,778 --> 00:24:53,444
What do you want?

513
00:24:53,447 --> 00:24:55,233
And careful, I'll know if you're lying.

514
00:24:56,691 --> 00:24:59,972
To figure out why I
am the way that I am.

515
00:24:59,975 --> 00:25:01,853
There's a darkness in me

516
00:25:02,522 --> 00:25:04,021
that I don't understand.

517
00:25:04,624 --> 00:25:05,857
That scares me.

518
00:25:07,788 --> 00:25:10,122
And I thought that
maybe if you had it, too,

519
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:11,824
which I think you do,

520
00:25:11,827 --> 00:25:14,506
you'd be able to help
me make sense of it.

521
00:25:15,301 --> 00:25:17,301
I know about the webcamming.

522
00:25:17,304 --> 00:25:19,464
That's why I got you the computer.

523
00:25:19,467 --> 00:25:22,100
So if you ever want to talk about that

524
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:24,100
or compare scars...

525
00:25:24,103 --> 00:25:26,022
No, thanks, I'll pass.

526
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,647
I told the doorman I
was here to see Veronica.

527
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:34,232
And I'll have to speak
to Andre about that.

528
00:25:34,235 --> 00:25:35,620
What is it, Archie?

529
00:25:35,622 --> 00:25:37,344
Why don't you like me, Mr. Lodge?

530
00:25:37,347 --> 00:25:39,714
Why is that? What did I ever do to you?

531
00:25:41,227 --> 00:25:42,660
You're really asking me that?

532
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:44,803
You really don't know?

533
00:25:44,806 --> 00:25:47,082
Yeah, I am, and, no, I don't.

534
00:25:47,085 --> 00:25:48,332
Your father

535
00:25:49,102 --> 00:25:51,082
slept with another man's wife.

536
00:25:51,085 --> 00:25:55,304
And why shouldn't I assume you
have the same weak character?

537
00:25:55,307 --> 00:25:58,176
I'm not my dad, Mr.
Lodge. I would never...

538
00:25:58,179 --> 00:26:00,972
Maybe that's true, but still

539
00:26:00,975 --> 00:26:02,967
you're not good enough for my daughter

540
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:05,316
in any respect. You're not worthy.

541
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:07,418
I don't think that you'll ever
be able to take care of her...

542
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,140
I took care of her
while you were in prison.

543
00:26:09,143 --> 00:26:10,272
Excuse me?

544
00:26:11,791 --> 00:26:13,824
When she and Mrs. Lodge
moved to Riverdale,

545
00:26:13,827 --> 00:26:16,522
I was there for your
daughter when you couldn't be.

546
00:26:16,525 --> 00:26:17,829
You would say that to me?

547
00:26:18,852 --> 00:26:20,251
In my house?

548
00:26:20,254 --> 00:26:22,554
What the hell is going on in here?

549
00:26:22,557 --> 00:26:24,530
Veronica...

550
00:26:24,533 --> 00:26:25,536
Hey, we were just...

551
00:26:25,539 --> 00:26:28,554
Having some juvenile
chest-thumping contest?

552
00:26:28,557 --> 00:26:30,905
No, not at all, mija. I just asked

553
00:26:30,908 --> 00:26:33,945
Archie to come over and plan
some one-on-one training.

554
00:26:33,948 --> 00:26:35,546
Really?

555
00:26:35,549 --> 00:26:38,343
Is that why it looks like
you're about to kill each other?

556
00:26:56,679 --> 00:26:57,812
Hello?

557
00:26:57,814 --> 00:26:59,541
Meet me outside in five minutes.

558
00:27:01,092 --> 00:27:02,725
Mr. Lodge?

559
00:27:02,728 --> 00:27:04,018
What time is it?

560
00:27:26,258 --> 00:27:27,423
Thank you.

561
00:27:29,805 --> 00:27:31,638
You know why I love wrestling, Archie?

562
00:27:31,641 --> 00:27:33,214
Because when it's two men on the mat,

563
00:27:33,216 --> 00:27:35,147
it doesn't matter who you are

564
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,751
or where you come from,

565
00:27:36,753 --> 00:27:38,541
or even how strong you are.

566
00:27:38,544 --> 00:27:40,054
It's about sheer will

567
00:27:40,057 --> 00:27:41,756
and knowing your opponent.

568
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:45,226
Maybe even better than he knows himself.

569
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:49,997
Which is why, Archie...

570
00:27:51,601 --> 00:27:52,800
you will never win.

571
00:27:55,071 --> 00:27:56,244
What are you talking about?

572
00:27:56,247 --> 00:27:57,788
Veronica...

573
00:27:57,791 --> 00:27:59,954
has a lot on her plate right now.

574
00:27:59,957 --> 00:28:02,124
And I don't want her worrying about us.

575
00:28:02,127 --> 00:28:05,479
So after this morning, we
can say that I helped you.

576
00:28:05,482 --> 00:28:07,548
And that we went for a jog

577
00:28:07,551 --> 00:28:09,228
and we broke bread together.

578
00:28:09,231 --> 00:28:12,353
And I will tolerate you

579
00:28:13,523 --> 00:28:16,157
until this phase runs its course.

580
00:28:16,671 --> 00:28:18,070
"Runs its course"?

581
00:28:18,073 --> 00:28:20,860
You're not the first boy who
has turned my daughter's head.

582
00:28:20,863 --> 00:28:23,798
You see, boyfriends,

583
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,833
they come and they go.

584
00:28:26,974 --> 00:28:28,340
But fathers...

585
00:28:31,908 --> 00:28:33,374
Fathers are forever.

586
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,979
You're not hungry, mija?

587
00:28:38,982 --> 00:28:40,457
Is it Archie and your dad?

588
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,801
No, it's Josie.

589
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,385
We got into a fight

590
00:28:44,388 --> 00:28:46,987
and she dropped out of Pickens Day.

591
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:48,122
I see.

592
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:51,726
And this is Sierra's doing, I assume?

593
00:28:53,329 --> 00:28:54,528
That's it.

594
00:28:55,732 --> 00:28:57,031
I'm taking care of this.

595
00:28:57,034 --> 00:28:58,787
No, Mom. It's like you said,

596
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:02,103
our family works differently
from other families.

597
00:29:03,228 --> 00:29:06,239
And if Josie and Mayor McCoy
don't like the way we do business,

598
00:29:06,242 --> 00:29:07,441
that's on them.

599
00:29:08,978 --> 00:29:10,478
But the show must go on.

600
00:29:12,448 --> 00:29:13,748
I was angry.

601
00:29:13,751 --> 00:29:15,910
Because the Southside is our home.

602
00:29:15,913 --> 00:29:18,786
I'm sick of watching it get dismantled

603
00:29:18,789 --> 00:29:21,371
piece by piece in front of our eyes.

604
00:29:21,374 --> 00:29:22,823
They take our drive-in.

605
00:29:22,826 --> 00:29:24,358
Then they take our school.

606
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,860
I thought you were apologizing.

607
00:29:27,497 --> 00:29:28,629
I am.

608
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,099
I shouldn't have used your story

609
00:29:32,102 --> 00:29:34,564
or what happened to the
Uktena against the Northside.

610
00:29:34,567 --> 00:29:36,003
I had no right...

611
00:29:42,178 --> 00:29:43,377
I had no right.

612
00:29:45,782 --> 00:29:47,048
I'm sorry.

613
00:29:49,752 --> 00:29:51,485
Whatever your reasons were,

614
00:29:53,189 --> 00:29:54,922
you opened an old wound.

615
00:29:56,966 --> 00:29:59,200
Now, something has
to be done to heal it.

616
00:30:00,563 --> 00:30:03,464
Do you have something in mind, Grandpa?

617
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:24,928
What are you doing here?

618
00:30:25,955 --> 00:30:27,088
Daddy invited me.

619
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:28,622
He told me it was your
last day of tryouts

620
00:30:28,624 --> 00:30:29,857
and that I should come watch.

621
00:30:30,993 --> 00:30:32,860
He says you guys had a good talk.

622
00:30:33,896 --> 00:30:35,876
Anyway, not that you need it,

623
00:30:35,879 --> 00:30:37,012
but good luck.

624
00:30:37,015 --> 00:30:39,373
I'll be up in the
stands, cheering you on.

625
00:30:52,182 --> 00:30:53,848
Gather around, boys.

626
00:30:54,885 --> 00:30:56,824
We're gonna change things up a bit.

627
00:30:56,827 --> 00:30:59,761
First up on the mat is Andrews,

628
00:30:59,764 --> 00:31:02,189
who is going up against Clayton.

629
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,626
Wait.

630
00:31:05,629 --> 00:31:07,964
Coach, isn't Chuck in a
higher weight class than me?

631
00:31:07,967 --> 00:31:10,738
Damn, Andrews. You sound
like my little sister.

632
00:31:10,741 --> 00:31:12,733
Come on. Time for Thunderdome.

633
00:31:12,736 --> 00:31:15,830
Enough chatter. In the center. Now.

634
00:31:52,308 --> 00:31:53,440
Archie.

635
00:32:02,151 --> 00:32:03,851
That's right, Archie. Get him.

636
00:32:27,843 --> 00:32:30,811
One. Two...

637
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:35,316
three!

638
00:32:50,296 --> 00:32:51,730
Eat up.

639
00:32:51,733 --> 00:32:54,152
Can't have an empty
stomach for Pickens Day.

640
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:57,913
Especially since it'll be
our first outing as a family.

641
00:32:57,916 --> 00:33:01,155
Actually, I'm, uh... I'm staying behind.

642
00:33:01,158 --> 00:33:04,241
I have a few odd jobs to
catch up on around the house.

643
00:33:04,244 --> 00:33:06,510
Fine, Hal, I won't beg.

644
00:33:06,513 --> 00:33:07,778
Salad.

645
00:33:28,894 --> 00:33:31,210
Sierra, I'm so glad you made it.

646
00:33:31,213 --> 00:33:33,944
And, Josie, I'm sorry you
won't be singing with us today.

647
00:33:33,947 --> 00:33:36,996
After that article came out,
I forbade her to, Hermione.

648
00:33:36,999 --> 00:33:38,309
I was worried.

649
00:33:38,311 --> 00:33:41,186
After all, we can't be too careful
when it comes to our children.

650
00:33:47,841 --> 00:33:49,569
That was a surprise, Archie...

651
00:33:50,585 --> 00:33:52,085
your victory over Clayton.

652
00:33:53,393 --> 00:33:54,592
Thank you, sir.

653
00:33:55,905 --> 00:33:57,850
Are we done, Mr. Lodge?

654
00:34:01,367 --> 00:34:02,928
Come by the Pembrooke tonight.

655
00:34:02,931 --> 00:34:04,689
We should talk about some things.

656
00:34:04,692 --> 00:34:06,003
I'll be there, sir.

657
00:34:11,277 --> 00:34:13,543
Have you ever had a maple snow-cone?

658
00:34:13,546 --> 00:34:15,230
I have not. Is it delicious?

659
00:34:15,233 --> 00:34:18,889
Oh, Chic... Betty, I'm so happy.

660
00:34:19,885 --> 00:34:21,084
Mom, Mom...

661
00:34:21,087 --> 00:34:22,053
Alice.

662
00:34:22,055 --> 00:34:24,553
Hal, I thought you
said you weren't coming.

663
00:34:24,556 --> 00:34:26,897
Do you know what you've
let into our house?

664
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,059
In the room next to Betty's?

665
00:34:28,061 --> 00:34:29,319
Would you lower your voice?

666
00:34:29,322 --> 00:34:30,922
And what on earth are you talking about?

667
00:34:30,925 --> 00:34:32,660
I went on your computer, Chic.

668
00:34:32,663 --> 00:34:35,863
I saw what you were doing
online with your clients.

669
00:34:35,866 --> 00:34:37,299
Dad, stop.

670
00:34:37,302 --> 00:34:40,058
Stop snooping and stop harassing him.

671
00:34:40,061 --> 00:34:41,660
And I don't want to hear it from you.

672
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:44,671
You bring home this... stranger

673
00:34:44,674 --> 00:34:46,682
and move him into Polly's bedroom?

674
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:50,553
It's not Polly's room
anymore, Hal. It's Chic's.

675
00:34:50,556 --> 00:34:54,452
He has to go, Alice, and
you know damn well why.

676
00:34:54,455 --> 00:34:58,452
Hal, I swear, I threw you
out once, I'll do it again.

677
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,895
I'm so sorry, honey.

678
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,330
Come on. Let's get some cone.

679
00:35:12,624 --> 00:35:14,257
Hello, Riverdale.

680
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,881
Happy Pickens Day.

681
00:35:15,884 --> 00:35:19,240
On behalf of Lodge Industries
and Andrews Construction,

682
00:35:19,243 --> 00:35:21,275
we are thrilled to kick things off

683
00:35:21,277 --> 00:35:23,577
with a new twist on an old favorite.

684
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,180

We're here representing
the dead and the silenced.

703
00:36:51,368 --> 00:36:53,567
Pickens Day is a lie.

704
00:36:54,637 --> 00:36:57,838
General Pickens slaughtered
the Uktena tribe,

705
00:36:57,841 --> 00:37:00,108
my grandfather's family.

706
00:37:00,111 --> 00:37:01,678
And this land,

707
00:37:01,681 --> 00:37:03,471
the land that we're standing on,

708
00:37:03,474 --> 00:37:06,720
the land that will soon
give way to a new Southside,

709
00:37:06,723 --> 00:37:08,263
was stolen from them.

710
00:37:09,085 --> 00:37:10,985
And we can't bring them back,

711
00:37:10,987 --> 00:37:14,455
but we can and we must honor them.

712
00:37:14,458 --> 00:37:17,224
Hey, folks, hi. Uh...

713
00:37:17,227 --> 00:37:20,480
I think we can all be
proud to live in a Riverdale

714
00:37:20,483 --> 00:37:23,898
where young people stand up for justice.

715
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,746
Where a young woman

716
00:37:25,749 --> 00:37:28,550
can defend the honor and
legacy of her grandfather.

717
00:37:28,553 --> 00:37:31,960
And where we can celebrate the
living legacy of the Uktena,

718
00:37:31,963 --> 00:37:35,991
who contribute to the rich
tapestry that is Riverdale,

719
00:37:35,994 --> 00:37:39,747
that is the Southside
and that will be SoDale.

720
00:37:39,749 --> 00:37:42,416
So let's hear a round of
applause for that, am I right?

721
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:45,519
That's right. What do you say, people?

722
00:37:55,657 --> 00:37:56,856
No.

723
00:38:09,941 --> 00:38:13,042
How about we get you
a proper dessert, Hal?

724
00:38:13,044 --> 00:38:14,744
It looks like you
could use some company,

725
00:38:14,746 --> 00:38:17,866
and I've got nowhere I need to be.

726
00:38:29,227 --> 00:38:30,459
Can I come in?

727
00:38:31,929 --> 00:38:33,129
Sure.

728
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,116
Betty, I have a confession to make.

729
00:38:38,736 --> 00:38:40,694
The first night I was here,

730
00:38:40,697 --> 00:38:43,105
I came into your room
while you were sleeping.

731
00:38:44,075 --> 00:38:45,341
What?

732
00:38:45,344 --> 00:38:47,057
I kept waking up that night

733
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,678
trying to understand,

734
00:38:48,681 --> 00:38:51,847
"Why would this girl go
back to that place for me?"

735
00:38:54,085 --> 00:38:57,586
But I think, maybe, I understand now.

736
00:38:58,489 --> 00:38:59,889
You're alone here.

737
00:39:03,895 --> 00:39:05,895
We'll start with why I webcam.

738
00:39:07,598 --> 00:39:09,725
One of the reasons is to make money.

739
00:39:10,835 --> 00:39:14,170
The other reason is to escape.

740
00:39:16,407 --> 00:39:18,147
To pretend to be someone else.

741
00:39:20,185 --> 00:39:21,451
Yes, but...

742
00:39:22,847 --> 00:39:24,146
more than that...

743
00:39:26,966 --> 00:39:30,768
it's a way of getting away from
the darkness I feel inside me, too.

744
00:39:37,829 --> 00:39:39,889
Can you show me how to do that?

745
00:39:50,809 --> 00:39:54,089
And so, with the stroke of a few keys,

746
00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:57,179
the dark education of
Betty Cooper had begun.

747
00:39:58,082 --> 00:39:59,902
And also, perhaps,

748
00:39:59,905 --> 00:40:03,252
the criminal apprenticeship
of Archie Andrews.

749
00:40:04,897 --> 00:40:06,829
Let's start with a blank slate, Archie.

750
00:40:06,832 --> 00:40:09,025
Where do you see yourself in five years?

751
00:40:09,028 --> 00:40:12,728
In college. Hopefully on some
type of athletic scholarship.

752
00:40:13,631 --> 00:40:14,897
To study music?

753
00:40:16,467 --> 00:40:18,634
No, that was the old me.

754
00:40:20,338 --> 00:40:24,319
Now I'm thinking more like... business.

755
00:40:24,322 --> 00:40:26,214
Hmm.

756
00:40:26,217 --> 00:40:27,976
Maybe one day I'll even be able

757
00:40:27,979 --> 00:40:29,945
to buy back Andrews
Construction from you.

758
00:40:32,517 --> 00:40:34,549
Archie,

759
00:40:34,552 --> 00:40:36,719
as long as you're dating Veronica,

760
00:40:36,722 --> 00:40:38,960
I'm going to demand the best from you...

761
00:40:40,825 --> 00:40:42,792
and that requires
learning from the best.

762
00:40:42,794 --> 00:40:45,861
How would like to start your business
tutelage under my shepherding?

763
00:40:59,177 --> 00:41:00,631
Sorry about that, Mr. Lodge.

764
00:41:03,881 --> 00:41:05,314
You mean like an internship?

765
00:41:09,687 --> 00:41:12,077
That night, plans would be made...

766
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,356
Alliances would be formed,

767
00:41:14,358 --> 00:41:18,194
and a horrifying act of
desecration would be committed...

768
00:41:18,196 --> 00:41:21,191
Must've happened late last
night or early this morning.

769
00:41:21,194 --> 00:41:23,332
Well, Hiram, Hermione,

770
00:41:23,335 --> 00:41:25,147
it's your show now.

771
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,983
How would you like this handled?

772
00:41:26,986 --> 00:41:30,136
Swiftly, and with extreme prejudice.

773
00:41:30,139 --> 00:41:33,142
I believe we all know who
the most likely suspects are.

774
00:41:33,911 --> 00:41:35,344
I mean, you tell me.

775
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,013
Isn't this something
the Serpents would do?

776
00:41:38,015 --> 00:41:40,418
...ensuring that the town's civil war

777
00:41:40,421 --> 00:41:44,381
would go from a possibility
to an inevitability.

778
00:41:47,804 --> 00:41:51,050
