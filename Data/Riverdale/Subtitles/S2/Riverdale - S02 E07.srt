1
00:00:00,876 --> 00:00:02,153
Previously on Riverdale...

2
00:00:02,156 --> 00:00:03,223
Bee and Vee, ladies...

3
00:00:03,226 --> 00:00:04,427
You're not allowed to go around

4
00:00:04,429 --> 00:00:06,028
humiliating girls for any reason...

5
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:07,828
If you wanna ride the Chuck
wagon, that can be arranged.

6
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,676
If you hadn't come when you did...

7
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,528
Where is he?

8
00:00:11,531 --> 00:00:12,898
The Pussycats already saved me.

9
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:14,204
Am I supposed to pay you?

10
00:00:14,207 --> 00:00:15,265
I do you a favor.

11
00:00:15,268 --> 00:00:16,678
One day, you do me a favor.

12
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,313
You went to see Penny Peabody?

13
00:00:18,316 --> 00:00:19,582
Do not contact her again.

14
00:00:19,585 --> 00:00:21,677
If she reaches out, don't respond.

15
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:23,212
The cops are rounding up Ghoulies!

16
00:00:23,214 --> 00:00:24,446
You called the cops?

17
00:00:24,448 --> 00:00:26,181
You think I knew Keller
was gonna be there?

18
00:00:26,183 --> 00:00:27,863
- I called Keller.
- What the hell, Archie?

19
00:00:27,866 --> 00:00:29,809
I found out who killed Jason Blossom.

20
00:00:29,812 --> 00:00:32,021
I found out who the Sugarman was.

21
00:00:32,024 --> 00:00:33,022
You're next.

22
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:34,690
Black Hood.

23
00:00:38,162 --> 00:00:44,336
_

24
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:50,937
_

25
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:57,933
_

26
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:05,649
_

27
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,623
"People of Riverdale,

28
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:10,626
I have rid this town of the
drug-dealing child-killer

29
00:01:10,628 --> 00:01:11,760
and others like him."

30
00:01:11,762 --> 00:01:13,896
"Now, you must choose your fate.

31
00:01:13,898 --> 00:01:16,131
The next 48 hours will be a test.

32
00:01:16,133 --> 00:01:18,367
And I will be watching
you very closely."

33
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,169
"Show me you are pure of heart,

34
00:01:20,171 --> 00:01:21,970
and my work ends.

35
00:01:22,644 --> 00:01:24,310
Continue to sin,

36
00:01:25,843 --> 00:01:27,843
and I will take up the sword again."

37
00:01:29,246 --> 00:01:31,847
I thought I'd finally
outsmarted him, Jug,

38
00:01:31,849 --> 00:01:33,649
the Black Hood...

39
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:37,686
By having Mr. Phillips arrested,

40
00:01:37,688 --> 00:01:40,222
I thought I was saving
his life, but instead...

41
00:01:40,224 --> 00:01:41,905
Hey, Betty,

42
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:45,981
Phillips didn't deserve what
happened to him, but he was...

43
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:49,198
A high school teacher dealing drugs.

44
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:51,266
- I mean, Betty if it...
- And how the hell

45
00:01:51,268 --> 00:01:53,669
did the Black Hood even get
into the Sheriff's Station?

46
00:01:55,473 --> 00:01:57,306
I mean, unless he...

47
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,642
What?

48
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,366
What is it, Poirot?

49
00:02:04,515 --> 00:02:06,915
Nothing. No. It's too crazy.

50
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:13,689
Hello.

51
00:02:13,691 --> 00:02:14,996
It's Penny Peabody,

52
00:02:14,999 --> 00:02:17,025
remember that favor you owe me?

53
00:02:17,028 --> 00:02:18,660
I'm calling it in.

54
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,964
Uh, no, no. Wait,
wait, hold on a minute.

55
00:02:21,966 --> 00:02:24,333
I'm hungry, I'll meet you at Pop's.

56
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:29,104
I can't do this favor
for you, whatever it is.

57
00:02:29,106 --> 00:02:31,230
If I have to pay for
you helping my dad...

58
00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:33,942
He needs more help, that's why I called.

59
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,378
FP got in a little "accident",

60
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,481
with some Ghoulies in the
prison showers the other day.

61
00:02:39,483 --> 00:02:40,716
Oh, my God.

62
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:42,217
Listen. He's in the infirmary now.

63
00:02:42,219 --> 00:02:43,352
Is he okay?

64
00:02:43,354 --> 00:02:45,120
Well, they messed up
that pretty face of his.

65
00:02:46,157 --> 00:02:48,023
The Ghoulies wanted blood payback

66
00:02:48,025 --> 00:02:49,992
for the deal you and
that Northsider made

67
00:02:49,994 --> 00:02:52,303
with Sheriff Keller, got all
their higher-ups locked away.

68
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:54,089
That wasn't...

69
00:02:54,092 --> 00:02:55,964
What can we do, to get him out?

70
00:02:55,966 --> 00:02:57,766
For that you would need
money. You need money.

71
00:02:57,769 --> 00:02:58,767
Rich people?

72
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:00,436
Rich people don't sit in jail.

73
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:03,071
Money greases the wheels of justice.

74
00:03:03,073 --> 00:03:04,706
I have $18 to my name.

75
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,008
Hmm.

76
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,417
Well, then maybe we should
think of this favor as a job.

77
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,445
Right?

78
00:03:09,447 --> 00:03:10,813
Just a one-time delivery.

79
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:13,015
You just pick up a
crate on the Southside,

80
00:03:13,017 --> 00:03:15,317
deliver it to an address
in Greendale. That's it.

81
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:16,652
What's in the crate?

82
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,987
Let's say, um...

83
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,608
Pancake mix.

84
00:03:22,092 --> 00:03:24,374
Penny, I'm not gonna
be your drug-runner.

85
00:03:24,377 --> 00:03:28,147
Of course not. You're gonna
be my "transportation advisor."

86
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,966
Do this,

87
00:03:30,968 --> 00:03:33,564
and I'll use your cut of
the cash for your dad's case.

88
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:35,934
I'll see what we can do about
getting him an early release.

89
00:03:35,937 --> 00:03:37,661
Okay. Okay, I'll do it.

90
00:03:37,664 --> 00:03:39,467
Good boy. Okay. Now, you
just gotta make the drop off

91
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,858
and get out of there before midnight.

92
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,928
'Cause you don't want to be in
Greendale after midnight, trust me.

93
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,745
All right? And, um, this crate,

94
00:03:44,748 --> 00:03:46,315
it's not gonna fit on your bike.

95
00:03:46,317 --> 00:03:47,583
Can you get a car?

96
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,691
_

97
00:03:52,694 --> 00:03:54,309
Jug? What are you doing here?

98
00:03:54,312 --> 00:03:56,792
Out of the way, Bert & Ernie.

99
00:03:58,662 --> 00:04:00,729
Archie, listen. I need your help.

100
00:04:00,732 --> 00:04:02,231
You owe me,

101
00:04:02,233 --> 00:04:03,699
because of that little stunt you pulled

102
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:04,766
with Keller and the Ghoulies.

103
00:04:04,768 --> 00:04:05,901
Whatever you want.

104
00:04:05,903 --> 00:04:07,263
Name the time and place, and I'm there.

105
00:04:07,265 --> 00:04:10,132
It's tonight. And we need
to borrow your dad's truck.

106
00:04:10,135 --> 00:04:12,953
Archie... No questions asked, okay?

107
00:04:25,823 --> 00:04:27,923
Grab that side of the
crate, I'll grab the other.

108
00:04:44,308 --> 00:04:47,276
Jug, I will see this through,
but where does it end?

109
00:04:48,546 --> 00:04:50,746
115 Derby Street in Greendale.

110
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:53,081
Come on. I mean, how does
you being a Serpent end?

111
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,416
I don't know.

112
00:04:55,976 --> 00:04:59,121
I'm kind of just living
minute-to-minute here.

113
00:04:59,123 --> 00:05:00,656
All right?

114
00:05:06,163 --> 00:05:07,963
You know, I had this stupid idea.

115
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,433
That after graduation,
instead of going to college,

116
00:05:11,435 --> 00:05:13,001
we'd both move to New York.

117
00:05:13,637 --> 00:05:15,137
You were this writer.

118
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,532
And I'd be this musician,

119
00:05:16,535 --> 00:05:18,750
we'd both live in, like, the
East Village or something.

120
00:05:18,753 --> 00:05:19,960
Just doing our thing.

121
00:05:19,963 --> 00:05:21,997
Pretty sure the East Village
doesn't exist anymore.

122
00:05:23,681 --> 00:05:25,847
Where are Betty and
Veronica in this scenario?

123
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,864
They're roommates on Park Avenue.

124
00:05:32,356 --> 00:05:33,388
No, but seriously,

125
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,957
you stay on this path, Jughead,

126
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,491
you're gonna end up in jail.

127
00:05:36,494 --> 00:05:38,727
Or maybe worse than jail.

128
00:05:49,707 --> 00:05:52,107
And of course, I don't
have a friggin' spare.

129
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,076
We're gonna have to call Triple C.

130
00:05:54,078 --> 00:05:55,310
What? We have the crate in the back.

131
00:05:55,312 --> 00:05:57,746
No, no. Let's call Betty.
She can bring us a tire.

132
00:05:57,748 --> 00:06:00,082
Are you crazy? No,
Betty is not an option.

133
00:06:00,084 --> 00:06:01,883
I am not letting you
drag her into this mess.

134
00:06:01,885 --> 00:06:03,685
Hey, calm down. You're right.

135
00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:06,588
Kevin! He's got a truck.
Let's call him. Come on.

136
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:07,656
Yeah.

137
00:06:20,537 --> 00:06:21,803
Okay.

138
00:06:21,806 --> 00:06:23,572
Play it cool.

139
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,241
Having some car trouble?

140
00:06:33,244 --> 00:06:34,731
- No.
- Yeah.

141
00:06:37,788 --> 00:06:39,154
We need a spare.

142
00:06:40,057 --> 00:06:42,257
Or a ride to Greendale, if you can help.

143
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,992
Uh, no spare,

144
00:06:43,995 --> 00:06:46,196
but I'm passing through Greendale.

145
00:06:48,432 --> 00:06:50,065
What's in the crate?

146
00:06:50,068 --> 00:06:51,800
Pancake mix.

147
00:06:51,803 --> 00:06:54,436
Well, I can take you, but
it's going to cost you.

148
00:06:54,438 --> 00:06:56,605
- How much cash you got?
- $18.

149
00:06:57,374 --> 00:06:59,074
I only got room for one of you.

150
00:06:59,077 --> 00:07:01,443
Me. And the crate.

151
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,581
You're not seriously gonna

152
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:07,916
go with this guy alone, are you?

153
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:09,718
We don't really have any other choices.

154
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,453
Hey, we doing this or not?

155
00:07:11,455 --> 00:07:13,689
Yeah, yes we are.

156
00:07:14,658 --> 00:07:16,858
It's all right. Just stay
with your dad's truck.

157
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,894
Hey, you've come this far.

158
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:20,295
We're all good.

159
00:07:20,298 --> 00:07:21,797
Okay?

160
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,174
Don't look under that tarp, boy.

161
00:07:49,793 --> 00:07:51,526
Thought your friend back there was

162
00:07:51,528 --> 00:07:53,295
Jason Blossom,

163
00:07:53,298 --> 00:07:55,564
for just a hot minute.

164
00:07:55,567 --> 00:07:58,033
You never know on the road to Greendale.

165
00:08:02,164 --> 00:08:05,524
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -

166
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:09,522
This is truly judgment day,

167
00:08:09,524 --> 00:08:10,734
and he is the reaper,

168
00:08:10,737 --> 00:08:13,704
for Riverdale is soulless and corrupt.

169
00:08:13,707 --> 00:08:16,829
But in the Black of the
Hood is the light of God,

170
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:19,765
and when you see it, you will die.

171
00:08:19,768 --> 00:08:22,234
Unless you are of
heavenly things and pure...

172
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:23,803
Do you mind if I turn this down?

173
00:08:23,805 --> 00:08:27,740
There's a lot of righteous people
saying he's doing God's work,

174
00:08:27,743 --> 00:08:29,642
The Black Hood.

175
00:08:29,645 --> 00:08:31,991
That's one way of lookin' at it, yeah.

176
00:08:31,994 --> 00:08:33,327
Yeah.

177
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,481
You know what this
whole Black Hood thing

178
00:08:35,483 --> 00:08:37,016
reminds me of, don't you?

179
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:41,320
The Riverdale Reaper, is what.

180
00:08:41,323 --> 00:08:42,523
Riverdale had a Reaper?

181
00:08:42,526 --> 00:08:45,326
Makes my blood run cold
just thinking about it.

182
00:08:49,268 --> 00:08:51,281
- Thanks for the tire.
- You got it.

183
00:09:23,912 --> 00:09:25,445
Fill her up.

184
00:09:25,448 --> 00:09:27,281
I'll go pay inside.

185
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:02,601
Hey, boy!

186
00:10:05,373 --> 00:10:06,972
There's a cafe over there.

187
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:09,742
I'm starving. Come on, now.

188
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,488
I saw you, look under my tarp.

189
00:10:23,257 --> 00:10:25,558
Don't worry, I got my permits.

190
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,927
I'm no thrill-seeking sicko,

191
00:10:27,929 --> 00:10:29,237
like the Black Hood.

192
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,796
Or the Riverdale Reaper.

193
00:10:31,866 --> 00:10:33,899
Who exactly was the Riverdale Reaper?

194
00:10:33,902 --> 00:10:37,036
There was a family living
out near Fox Forest.

195
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:39,838
Good family.

196
00:10:39,841 --> 00:10:43,676
Mother, father, two kids.

197
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:47,046
One night, they were all asleep,

198
00:10:47,049 --> 00:10:48,380
someone broke in.

199
00:10:48,382 --> 00:10:52,518
A boogeyman went room
to room with a shotgun.

200
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,986
Shot 'em all dead.

201
00:10:53,988 --> 00:10:55,621
No survivors.

202
00:10:55,624 --> 00:10:57,389
Oh, my God.

203
00:10:57,392 --> 00:10:58,991
Did they find him? The Reaper?

204
00:10:58,993 --> 00:11:01,961
Some people say the lynch mob got him.

205
00:11:01,963 --> 00:11:04,377
Hung him from the
tree near Pickens Park.

206
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,865
Others think he hopped a train

207
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:08,968
and went out to California.

208
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:11,070
Started praying to the Devil.

209
00:11:11,072 --> 00:11:15,081
Others say he never left Riverdale.

210
00:11:16,932 --> 00:11:18,677
What are you saying?

211
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,813
You think the Riverdale
Reaper is the Black Hood?

212
00:11:20,815 --> 00:11:23,716
I'm saying that there's
a cycle to things.

213
00:11:23,718 --> 00:11:27,086
What happened then,
what's happening now.

214
00:11:27,088 --> 00:11:29,088
It's killing season in Riverdale.

215
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:33,292
And I wouldn't be surprised
if it was the same man.

216
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:36,762
Here's the check,

217
00:11:36,764 --> 00:11:37,830
when you're ready.

218
00:11:37,832 --> 00:11:39,498
My friend here'll pay for it.

219
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,733
What?

220
00:11:40,735 --> 00:11:42,768
I don't have any money,

221
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,236
I gave it to you... 18 bucks.

222
00:11:44,238 --> 00:11:45,404
I used that for the gas.

223
00:11:45,406 --> 00:11:47,260
Well, somebody's gotta pay for this.

224
00:11:47,263 --> 00:11:49,675
Oh, good luck, Crown
Boy. I'm outta here.

225
00:11:49,677 --> 00:11:51,243
And I'm taking that crate with me.

226
00:11:51,245 --> 00:11:52,978
- No, you aren't, man.
- Hey! Where are you going?

227
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,313
Nobody move, I'm calling the Sheriff...

228
00:11:54,315 --> 00:11:55,190
- No!
- No!

229
00:11:55,193 --> 00:11:56,487
Jughead, what's going on?

230
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:57,849
They're trying to dine n' ditch!

231
00:11:57,852 --> 00:11:58,917
I'm calling the cops!

232
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,352
Two boys on a country road,

233
00:12:00,354 --> 00:12:02,187
with a crate full
of God-knows-what.

234
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:03,922
You're sinners, both of you.

235
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:06,992
Careful or you'll taste
the Reaper's blade next.

236
00:12:06,994 --> 00:12:08,494
I'll pay for the bill.

237
00:12:08,497 --> 00:12:09,928
Do you take debit?

238
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:18,470
Hey.

239
00:12:18,473 --> 00:12:20,305
Thanks.

240
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,142
And thank you for coming back for me.

241
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:26,078
I said I'd see this through, Jug.

242
00:12:31,568 --> 00:12:32,867
It's 11:52.

243
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,420
Better get goin' then.

244
00:13:14,829 --> 00:13:16,361
You're late.

245
00:13:17,252 --> 00:13:18,652
We had car trouble.

246
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:23,001
- Whoa, whoa.
- Next time don't be late.

247
00:13:23,746 --> 00:13:25,145
No next time.

248
00:13:25,148 --> 00:13:27,106
No, this was a one-time thing.

249
00:13:27,108 --> 00:13:29,141
That's not what Snake Charmer tells me.

250
00:13:29,143 --> 00:13:32,811
She says the Serpents are
taking over for the Ghoulies.

251
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:34,847
We're set for a regular delivery,

252
00:13:34,849 --> 00:13:37,216
with a regular delivery boy.

253
00:13:37,219 --> 00:13:42,019
Which one of you is Jughead Jones?

254
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:43,522
You know my name?

255
00:13:43,525 --> 00:13:45,457
Ah.

256
00:14:18,526 --> 00:14:20,526
Thank you for helping me tonight, I...

257
00:14:20,528 --> 00:14:21,994
I know that, that

258
00:14:21,997 --> 00:14:24,635
violates every strand of your DNA.

259
00:14:24,638 --> 00:14:26,245
We've all done bad things, Jug.

260
00:14:26,248 --> 00:14:28,381
Ever since the Black Hood
walked into this diner.

261
00:14:29,632 --> 00:14:31,298
It's like he's making us do them.

262
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:35,340
I was thinking about that guy
who stopped for us tonight,

263
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:36,675
Mr. American Gothic.

264
00:14:36,677 --> 00:14:38,811
His story about the Riverdale Reaper.

265
00:14:38,814 --> 00:14:41,727
Maybe it's just a tale
from the dark side but...

266
00:14:43,702 --> 00:14:45,001
What if,

267
00:14:45,004 --> 00:14:47,354
it's an actual lead?

268
00:14:47,357 --> 00:14:49,488
Maybe tomorrow,

269
00:14:49,491 --> 00:14:51,223
you and I,

270
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:53,088
if you're free, we
could go to library...

271
00:14:53,091 --> 00:14:55,894
Me and Reggie are taking
Moose to physical therapy.

272
00:14:55,897 --> 00:14:57,429
Then Ronnie and I are having dinner

273
00:14:57,431 --> 00:14:58,831
with her parents.

274
00:15:00,929 --> 00:15:02,562
But maybe the day after?

275
00:15:02,565 --> 00:15:05,393
Yeah. For sure.

276
00:15:07,223 --> 00:15:09,393
Can't you get out of this somehow, Jug?

277
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,275
What part exactly?

278
00:15:14,551 --> 00:15:15,750
I can try.

279
00:15:17,618 --> 00:15:19,117
Hey, I'll try.

280
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,693
Do you want a ride home?
It's practically dawn.

281
00:15:27,696 --> 00:15:29,361
No, um...

282
00:15:29,364 --> 00:15:31,496
Visiting hours start at sun up.

283
00:15:31,499 --> 00:15:33,900
I'm gonna visit my dad.

284
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:04,763
What's up? You look
like you've seen a ghost.

285
00:16:04,765 --> 00:16:07,566
What the hell game
are you playing, Penny?

286
00:16:07,568 --> 00:16:10,502
- You lied to me. My dad's fine.
- I incentivized you.

287
00:16:10,504 --> 00:16:12,571
No, you said that this was
gonna be a one-and-done.

288
00:16:12,573 --> 00:16:14,439
It's not like you have a choice.

289
00:16:17,845 --> 00:16:18,877
What is this?

290
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:21,313
It's insurance you'll do what I say.

291
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:22,948
And if you cause a stink

292
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,283
or try to back out,

293
00:16:24,285 --> 00:16:26,785
or raise your voice to me ever again,

294
00:16:26,787 --> 00:16:29,655
I will make sure that video goes
straight to the Sheriff's office.

295
00:16:29,657 --> 00:16:31,957
God, imagine what that
would do to your dad's heart.

296
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:33,659
Break it, right?

297
00:16:36,531 --> 00:16:37,863
Why?

298
00:16:37,866 --> 00:16:40,632
- Why me?
- FP made me a promise,

299
00:16:40,635 --> 00:16:42,200
that he didn't keep.

300
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:44,569
As far as I'm concerned,
his debt is yours.

301
00:16:44,572 --> 00:16:46,913
And I am just getting started with you.

302
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,233
_

303
00:17:05,828 --> 00:17:07,394
Mr. Svenson,

304
00:17:07,397 --> 00:17:09,196
you scared me.

305
00:17:09,198 --> 00:17:11,565
I was about to lock up.
Are you gonna be okay?

306
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:14,067
Yeah, yeah, I'll just, uh,

307
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:16,336
slip out the side door, like usual.

308
00:17:16,338 --> 00:17:18,238
As long as you don't
tell Principal Weatherbee.

309
00:17:18,241 --> 00:17:20,073
He'd have my head.

310
00:17:28,984 --> 00:17:30,717
♪ Everything ♪

311
00:17:30,845 --> 00:17:32,619
♪ Everything ♪

312
00:17:46,802 --> 00:17:48,735
Josephine McCoy.

313
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,939
Why do you think I moved
us into the Five Seasons?

314
00:17:52,941 --> 00:17:54,408
Because,

315
00:17:54,411 --> 00:17:56,243
you don't feel safe at the house.

316
00:17:56,245 --> 00:17:59,680
Baby, I don't want you
walking the streets alone,

317
00:17:59,682 --> 00:18:01,694
not with the Black Hood out there.

318
00:18:01,697 --> 00:18:04,584
I am this close to assigning
a deputy to you for security.

319
00:18:04,586 --> 00:18:07,754
Mom! I don't need a bodyguard.

320
00:18:07,757 --> 00:18:09,723
I'm not Whitney.

321
00:18:09,726 --> 00:18:11,224
Not yet, anyway.

322
00:18:11,226 --> 00:18:13,593
I want you in this hotel

323
00:18:13,595 --> 00:18:15,862
before dark from now on.

324
00:18:15,864 --> 00:18:17,931
- Mom.
- Understood?

325
00:18:19,568 --> 00:18:21,301
Yes, ma'am.

326
00:18:23,505 --> 00:18:26,540
The Black Hood has my mom on
edge and she has me on edge,

327
00:18:26,542 --> 00:18:27,708
and when I get stressed,

328
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,609
the polyps on my vocal chords swell

329
00:18:29,611 --> 00:18:31,044
and I lose my voice.

330
00:18:31,046 --> 00:18:32,546
On top of which,

331
00:18:33,315 --> 00:18:35,326
going behind the Pussycats' back,

332
00:18:35,329 --> 00:18:37,350
working on songs without them.

333
00:18:37,352 --> 00:18:40,320
You feel like you're sinning, and
the Black Hood is going after sinners.

334
00:18:40,323 --> 00:18:43,010
I get it. And you're
allowed to feel guilty.

335
00:18:43,013 --> 00:18:44,072
Up to a point,

336
00:18:44,075 --> 00:18:46,560
but I slipped that vid
of you singing "Milkshake"

337
00:18:46,562 --> 00:18:48,725
to that producer at
Shabbey Road Studios,

338
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:51,798
and he was adamant about
giving you and you alone,

339
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,433
studio time.

340
00:18:58,474 --> 00:19:01,808
OMG. Another gift from
your secret admirer?

341
00:19:01,811 --> 00:19:02,993
Gotta get a new lock.

342
00:19:02,996 --> 00:19:04,511
That's the third gift this week.

343
00:19:04,513 --> 00:19:06,780
Who could this mystery bae be?

344
00:19:06,782 --> 00:19:09,249
Ooh, maybe it's the Black Hood.

345
00:19:09,251 --> 00:19:11,284
You know he loves writing notes.

346
00:19:11,286 --> 00:19:12,953
That is not funny, Cheryl.

347
00:19:17,126 --> 00:19:19,025

Chuck Clayton? Can I help you?

351
00:19:30,139 --> 00:19:32,939
Well, I heard that voice
and I could not resist.

352
00:19:32,942 --> 00:19:34,517
So, uh,

353
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,410
I know this may seem a
little out of the blue.

354
00:19:37,412 --> 00:19:39,478
But I was wondering
if maybe you and I...

355
00:19:39,481 --> 00:19:40,881
No.

356
00:19:40,884 --> 00:19:43,217
Not even some cheese fries at Pop's?

357
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,386
Wait, hold up.

358
00:19:49,091 --> 00:19:51,191
Are you the one putting
things in my locker?

359
00:19:51,193 --> 00:19:52,959
- Well, I can be.
- Ew.

360
00:19:52,961 --> 00:19:54,961
Sorry, Chuck. I don't date.

361
00:19:54,963 --> 00:19:59,800
Especially not chauvinistic,
misogynistic harassers of women, like you.

362
00:20:01,236 --> 00:20:03,403
I've got bio.

363
00:20:07,323 --> 00:20:09,223
You will not believe this.

364
00:20:09,226 --> 00:20:12,112
Chuck Clayton just
asked me out on a date.

365
00:20:12,114 --> 00:20:14,447
That's vile, assuming you said no.

366
00:20:14,449 --> 00:20:16,103
Yeah, I'm not insane.

367
00:20:16,106 --> 00:20:18,652
Good. Because we've a date
with the recording studio

368
00:20:18,654 --> 00:20:20,120
Maybe after school today?

369
00:20:20,122 --> 00:20:22,956
No way. I'm heading straight
to the girls' locker room

370
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:24,090
for a eucalyptus steam.

371
00:20:24,092 --> 00:20:25,492
My throat's been acting up...

372
00:20:25,494 --> 00:20:27,227
- Josie, we have to practice...
- Good Lord, Cheryl.

373
00:20:27,229 --> 00:20:29,830
I don't know who's more
controlling, you or my mom.

374
00:20:32,025 --> 00:20:33,867
Josie, what you did,

375
00:20:33,869 --> 00:20:36,970
saving me from that Nick St. Creature.

376
00:20:38,073 --> 00:20:40,707
It's a debt I'll never be able to repay.

377
00:20:41,493 --> 00:20:45,078
What I can do is offer my humble
skills to make your career blossom.

378
00:20:45,881 --> 00:20:48,481
But I'm happy to take a step back

379
00:20:48,483 --> 00:20:49,883
if you're feeling overwhelmed.

380
00:20:49,885 --> 00:20:51,651
No, no.

381
00:20:53,188 --> 00:20:54,688
It's all good.

382
00:20:59,963 --> 00:21:01,595
Oh, my God...

383
00:21:01,598 --> 00:21:03,363
Hey, what's up.

384
00:21:03,366 --> 00:21:05,232
Is it true you're ditching us?

385
00:21:06,168 --> 00:21:08,668
- Who told you that?
- Someone put a note in my locker.

386
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,070
- What?
- Josie.

387
00:21:10,072 --> 00:21:12,405
Women are supposed to treat
each other better than this.

388
00:21:12,408 --> 00:21:14,441
We're your sisters, and
you clawed us in the back.

389
00:21:14,443 --> 00:21:16,343
It's not as black-and-white as that.

390
00:21:16,345 --> 00:21:19,179
Okay, this... This opportunity
just fell in my lap.

391
00:21:19,181 --> 00:21:20,380
Then why didn't you talk to us?

392
00:21:20,382 --> 00:21:21,686
Why be all shady and hide it?

393
00:21:21,689 --> 00:21:24,317
Because she wants to
try it as a solo diva.

394
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:26,119
Well, go ahead, Josie.

395
00:21:26,121 --> 00:21:29,289
Try it, girl. 'Cause
you're on your own now.

396
00:21:29,292 --> 00:21:32,192
What? No, wait! No, Val!

397
00:21:32,194 --> 00:21:34,861
Pride cometh before the fall, Josie.

398
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,809
Who's there?

399
00:22:00,222 --> 00:22:02,222
God! Chuck!

400
00:22:02,225 --> 00:22:03,691
Chuck!

401
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:07,027
- Oh, my God.
- Josie, are you okay?

402
00:22:07,629 --> 00:22:09,262
Yeah.

403
00:22:09,265 --> 00:22:10,630
I'm fine.

404
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:14,227
Hey, you wanna... You
wanna give me a ride home?

405
00:22:14,236 --> 00:22:16,169
Yeah, yeah, of course.

406
00:22:16,172 --> 00:22:17,437
Okay.

407
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,713
Is it cool if we make one stop first?

408
00:22:19,716 --> 00:22:21,141
Don't.

409
00:22:21,143 --> 00:22:22,909
Don't give me that look.

410
00:22:22,911 --> 00:22:24,711
That "we are on a date" look.

411
00:22:24,713 --> 00:22:26,680
We are not on a date.

412
00:22:26,683 --> 00:22:28,181
Okay, I admit,

413
00:22:28,183 --> 00:22:30,717
- I don't have a great track record.
- Hmm.

414
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,285
But I am changing.

415
00:22:32,288 --> 00:22:34,478
I started going to church with my dad,

416
00:22:34,481 --> 00:22:36,389
and I'm taking these art classes.

417
00:22:36,391 --> 00:22:38,625
Why? To objectify models?

418
00:22:38,627 --> 00:22:41,061
No, I wanna draw comics

419
00:22:41,063 --> 00:22:42,829
or kids books.

420
00:22:42,831 --> 00:22:44,531
Chuck, be realistic.

421
00:22:44,533 --> 00:22:47,300
You expect me to just
believe that you've changed?

422
00:22:47,302 --> 00:22:48,468
Hey, kids.

423
00:22:49,538 --> 00:22:52,339
Really nice seeing you at
church on Sunday, Chuck.

424
00:22:52,342 --> 00:22:54,107
Maybe you can get this one to come.

425
00:22:54,109 --> 00:22:55,308
What?

426
00:22:56,945 --> 00:22:58,378
Did you plan that?

427
00:22:58,381 --> 00:22:59,679
No, I'm good.

428
00:22:59,682 --> 00:23:02,582
But I'm not that good.

429
00:23:02,585 --> 00:23:05,719
And, Josie, I really
am trying to be better.

430
00:23:10,726 --> 00:23:12,292
Come on, let's dance.

431
00:23:13,061 --> 00:23:15,028
- In Pop's?
- Why not?

432
00:23:47,363 --> 00:23:48,663
Josie!

433
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:50,764
- You are a damned fool.
- Mom, what are you doing here?

434
00:23:50,766 --> 00:23:51,898
Check your phone, young lady.

435
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,166
I've been texting you for hours.

436
00:23:53,168 --> 00:23:54,535
And you're in here doing the twist.

437
00:23:54,537 --> 00:23:55,432
Mom, relax.

438
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:59,689
Mayor McCoy, I was just about
to give Josie a ride home.

439
00:23:59,692 --> 00:24:01,474
You?

440
00:24:01,477 --> 00:24:06,079
I don't want you within
ten feet of my daughter!

441
00:24:13,113 --> 00:24:15,117
I cannot have you acting out, Josie,

442
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:16,718
not with everything that's going on.

443
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,754
I'm not acting out, Mom,

444
00:24:18,756 --> 00:24:20,155
I'm living my life.

445
00:24:20,157 --> 00:24:22,958
There are people in this town
with hate in their hearts.

446
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,760
You've read the letters I used to get.

447
00:24:24,762 --> 00:24:26,094
The words they used.

448
00:24:26,096 --> 00:24:28,196
And now, since the Black Hood started,

449
00:24:28,198 --> 00:24:29,831
it's gotten so much worse.

450
00:24:29,834 --> 00:24:30,999
It's like...

451
00:24:31,001 --> 00:24:33,101
It's like they're emboldened by him.

452
00:24:36,031 --> 00:24:38,165
I've started getting death threats.

453
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:39,708
Oh, my God.

454
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,810
The things they're saying, Josie,

455
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:44,613
they're going to "slit my throat."

456
00:24:44,615 --> 00:24:46,982
Or "cut out my heart."

457
00:24:46,984 --> 00:24:48,483
They're monsters.

458
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:50,118
And...

459
00:24:52,456 --> 00:24:53,755
What?

460
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:56,431
The last letter I got,

461
00:24:56,434 --> 00:24:58,427
mentioned you.

462
00:25:02,266 --> 00:25:03,832
I have to ask you, Josie,

463
00:25:04,868 --> 00:25:07,602
you received any letters? Or packages?

464
00:25:07,605 --> 00:25:09,871
Anything suspicious or threatening?

465
00:25:13,243 --> 00:25:14,443
No.

466
00:25:15,712 --> 00:25:17,179
No, nothing like that.

467
00:25:17,181 --> 00:25:19,431
I've worked so hard to get us here.

468
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:22,050
To shield us from this kind of hatred.

469
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,786
Mom.

470
00:25:32,529 --> 00:25:34,162
That someone would do that,

471
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:35,630
write those things to your mom?

472
00:25:35,632 --> 00:25:37,466
This town is seriously ill.

473
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:39,067
Tell me about it.

474
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,603
My mom's the mayor.

475
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:43,505
She's the strongest woman I know,

476
00:25:43,507 --> 00:25:46,475
and for these cowards
to be terrorizing her...

477
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:48,129
Do you want to bail on practice?

478
00:25:48,132 --> 00:25:49,598
No, I need to sing.

479
00:25:49,601 --> 00:25:51,279
It'll keep my mind off last night.

480
00:25:51,281 --> 00:25:52,948
Speaking of,

481
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:56,043
I cannot believe you went on
a date with Chuck last night.

482
00:25:56,046 --> 00:25:58,794
Taking a few art classes
does not a saint make.

483
00:25:58,797 --> 00:26:00,956
He really is trying
to be a better person.

484
00:26:00,958 --> 00:26:02,591
Is that why you didn't
tell Sheriff Keller

485
00:26:02,593 --> 00:26:05,026
he was low-key stalking you?

486
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:07,636
I'm giving Chuck the
benefit of the doubt.

487
00:26:07,639 --> 00:26:09,965
Fine. It's your funeral.

488
00:26:15,339 --> 00:26:16,872
Here we go again.

489
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,773
I'll give Chuck that.

490
00:26:18,775 --> 00:26:20,675
He knows how to commit.

491
00:26:29,052 --> 00:26:30,652
Oh, my God.

492
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:32,966
That is so not okay.

493
00:26:32,969 --> 00:26:35,107
It's a threat, Josie.

494
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,625
What's in the box?

495
00:26:43,066 --> 00:26:45,066
Oh, my God!

496
00:26:49,606 --> 00:26:51,473
Out of the way, Bert and Ernie.

497
00:26:53,544 --> 00:26:55,076
We got your note, Cretin.

498
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:57,979
This sick game you're
playing with my girl ends now.

499
00:26:57,981 --> 00:26:59,047
Some people may be buying

500
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:01,082
the snake oil you're
peddling, but not me.

501
00:27:01,084 --> 00:27:02,450
You're still the same
Chuck that thinks women

502
00:27:02,452 --> 00:27:04,319
are playthings to possess and torture.

503
00:27:04,321 --> 00:27:06,488
Cheryl, what are you even
talking about right now?

504
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,557
Stuffed animals are one thing,

505
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,525
- but a pig's heart?
- Josie, I, uh...

506
00:27:10,527 --> 00:27:12,794
If the Black Hood weren't
clearly an old white dude,

507
00:27:12,796 --> 00:27:14,729
I'd say you'd be a prime suspect.

508
00:27:14,731 --> 00:27:16,565
Hey, what's going on here?

509
00:27:16,567 --> 00:27:19,367
Oh, good. Mr. Svenson's
here to clean up the trash.

510
00:27:19,369 --> 00:27:20,969
Chuck's been threatening Josie,

511
00:27:20,971 --> 00:27:22,604
sending her disturbing messages.

512
00:27:22,606 --> 00:27:23,605
The creep probably wants to

513
00:27:23,607 --> 00:27:25,521
cut her open and feel her organs.

514
00:27:25,524 --> 00:27:26,908
Josie, is this true?

515
00:27:28,612 --> 00:27:31,613
For all we know, he's the one
sending your mom those letters, too.

516
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:33,281
Come on, Josie.

517
00:27:35,485 --> 00:27:37,852
It is. He's the one.

518
00:27:37,855 --> 00:27:39,486
- What?
- It's true.

519
00:27:39,489 --> 00:27:41,590
It is not true, and you know it.

520
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:44,492
- You're going to Weatherbee's office.
- You are lying!

521
00:27:44,494 --> 00:27:46,995
- You're lying! You're lying!
- Come on!

522
00:27:46,997 --> 00:27:48,363
All right!

523
00:27:51,222 --> 00:27:54,702
We spoke with Chuck and he'll be
steering clear of you from here on out.

524
00:27:54,705 --> 00:27:56,338
I'm glad they found the miscreant

525
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,139
that was doing this to you, baby.

526
00:27:58,141 --> 00:27:59,808
Actually, we may not have.

527
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:02,877
We spoke with Chuck and questioned
him and checked his locker,

528
00:28:02,879 --> 00:28:04,546
but we never found any evidence.

529
00:28:04,548 --> 00:28:06,147
Well, keep looking, Tom.

530
00:28:06,149 --> 00:28:09,324
If my daughter says it's him, it's him.

Nothing. No. It's too crazy.

549
00:29:38,855 --> 00:29:40,488
There's no way.

550
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,260
You guys, I'm worried about my dad.

551
00:29:46,262 --> 00:29:47,695
The town is turning on him.

552
00:29:47,697 --> 00:29:50,231
He's trying his best under
these crazy circumstances,

553
00:29:50,233 --> 00:29:53,000
but this Black Hood stuff
is really getting to him.

554
00:29:53,003 --> 00:29:55,686
- How is he dealing with it?
- Yeah, what's he been doing?

555
00:29:55,689 --> 00:29:57,055
He's not sleeping.

556
00:29:57,058 --> 00:29:58,522
He's not eating.

557
00:29:58,525 --> 00:30:01,375
I hear him rummaging around the house
at odd hours, talking to himself,

558
00:30:01,377 --> 00:30:03,244
just heading out in
the middle of the night.

559
00:30:03,246 --> 00:30:04,478
- Where do you think he's going?
- Where's he going?

560
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,113
I don't know. But
whatever it is, it's...

561
00:30:06,115 --> 00:30:07,648
It's like he's a different person.

562
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:14,689
Poor Kevin. He's like a character
in a lost Tennessee Williams play.

563
00:30:14,691 --> 00:30:17,858
Veronica, I have a theory
about Sheriff Keller.

564
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:20,361
Oh, me, too. It's obvious.

565
00:30:21,364 --> 00:30:23,204
- He's the Black Hood.
- He's having an affair.

566
00:30:23,207 --> 00:30:25,064
What?

567
00:30:25,067 --> 00:30:26,633
Is that a joke?

568
00:30:26,636 --> 00:30:27,802
I wish it were.

569
00:30:27,804 --> 00:30:31,205
Whatever crazy web that
you're spinning, Bee,

570
00:30:31,207 --> 00:30:32,673
let me break it down for you.

571
00:30:32,676 --> 00:30:34,408
Sheriff Keller's wife's away,

572
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:35,889
he's failing at his job,

573
00:30:35,892 --> 00:30:37,812
he's looking for comfort,
sneaking around...

574
00:30:37,814 --> 00:30:39,714
All signs point to cheating.

575
00:30:39,716 --> 00:30:42,316
Well, I don't know, maybe
he's having an affair,

576
00:30:42,318 --> 00:30:43,417
and he's the Black Hood.

577
00:30:43,419 --> 00:30:45,386
You've known Kevin's dad how many years?

578
00:30:45,388 --> 00:30:46,654
Okay, think about it,

579
00:30:46,657 --> 00:30:48,923
The Black Hood killed Mr. Phillips

580
00:30:48,925 --> 00:30:50,825
in a cell at the Sheriff's Station.

581
00:30:50,827 --> 00:30:51,959
How do you explain that?

582
00:30:51,961 --> 00:30:53,928
Betty, Kevin needs our
friendship right now,

583
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:55,963
not your groundless suspicions.

584
00:30:55,966 --> 00:30:57,565
Don't worry,

585
00:30:57,567 --> 00:31:00,501
my intuition's telling me
that he's having an affair.

586
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:03,404
But stay tuned while I prove it.

587
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:09,610
So I've been wracking my brain for
something that might cheer you up,

588
00:31:09,612 --> 00:31:11,245
and I have just the prescription.

589
00:31:11,248 --> 00:31:12,747
A sleepover!

590
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:15,593
- Doesn't that sound fun?
- A sleepover at the Pembrooke?

591
00:31:15,596 --> 00:31:17,218
Actually, Kev, I was thinking how

592
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,986
I've never seen your house.

593
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:22,355
Thank you for sitting
down with me, Sheriff.

594
00:31:22,358 --> 00:31:24,859
Like I said, I'm writing a
follow-up about Mr. Phillips.

595
00:31:24,861 --> 00:31:26,627
Well, I'm happy to oblige, Betty.

596
00:31:26,629 --> 00:31:29,530
How did the Black Hood get
to the Sugarman, Sheriff?

597
00:31:29,532 --> 00:31:30,866
Right here in the station?

598
00:31:30,869 --> 00:31:33,401
Forced entry. I was out on patrol

599
00:31:33,403 --> 00:31:36,404
and the overnight
deputy, he fell asleep.

600
00:31:36,407 --> 00:31:39,163
But breaking into your
station, that seems...

601
00:31:39,166 --> 00:31:40,565
Incredibly ballsy?

602
00:31:45,214 --> 00:31:46,514
Have a look at this.

603
00:31:46,516 --> 00:31:50,317
The Black Hood pried the
door open from the outside.

604
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,622
An then he just... Well,
come on, I'll show you.

605
00:31:58,895 --> 00:32:00,933
I'll take you down to the holding cells,

606
00:32:00,936 --> 00:32:03,129
where he shot Phillips.

607
00:32:03,132 --> 00:32:06,567
We've gathered shoeprints,
video surveillance and

608
00:32:06,569 --> 00:32:09,036
everything else we could
to catch this monster.

609
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:12,640
But what enrages me is that
it happened in my department,

610
00:32:12,643 --> 00:32:14,208
under my watch.

611
00:32:17,948 --> 00:32:20,347
And if you roll a six,

612
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:22,983
you can take over the
Kingdom of Theodore.

613
00:32:24,787 --> 00:32:26,153
Interesting.

614
00:32:28,424 --> 00:32:29,657
Uh...

615
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:32,526
I'm gonna go get a bevvy.
Do you want anything?

616
00:32:32,529 --> 00:32:34,536
A glass of milk would be great.

617
00:32:34,539 --> 00:32:37,164
- Betty?
- You're having a sleepover at Kevin's?

618
00:32:37,167 --> 00:32:39,600
Without me? In the middle
of an investigation?

619
00:32:39,602 --> 00:32:41,702
This isn't an investigation, okay?

620
00:32:41,704 --> 00:32:44,705
This is me helping a friend deal
with his father's infidelities.

621
00:32:44,707 --> 00:32:46,250
Oh, so you're there snooping to prove

622
00:32:46,253 --> 00:32:47,875
that Sheriff Keller's having an affair?

623
00:32:47,877 --> 00:32:50,177
Why else would I leave the
comforts of the Pembrooke?

624
00:32:50,179 --> 00:32:52,513
Can you please add looking for evidence

625
00:32:52,515 --> 00:32:54,381
that suggests Sheriff
Keller's the Black Hood

626
00:32:54,383 --> 00:32:55,716
to your to-do list?

627
00:32:55,719 --> 00:32:57,751
I'd start in the home office.

628
00:33:01,524 --> 00:33:02,756
It's locked.

629
00:33:02,758 --> 00:33:04,859
And, no, I don't have any bobby pins.

630
00:33:04,861 --> 00:33:06,594
Okay, check the basement.

631
00:33:06,596 --> 00:33:09,697
Yeah, I'm sure that's where
he keeps all his spare hoods.

632
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:16,871
No way. I am not going down there.

633
00:33:16,873 --> 00:33:20,040
Please. Just check to see if
something jumps out at you.

634
00:33:20,042 --> 00:33:21,842
Okay, fine.

635
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,739
Hey, Vee...

636
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:43,169
Oh, Veronica.

637
00:33:43,172 --> 00:33:44,731
What can I do for you?

638
00:33:44,734 --> 00:33:46,567
I was just...

639
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:49,970
Looking for juice or
diet soda or something.

640
00:33:49,972 --> 00:33:51,872
The fridge in the kitchen is empty and

641
00:33:51,874 --> 00:33:53,274
I'm parched.

642
00:33:53,277 --> 00:33:55,256
Well, there's some here, I think.

643
00:33:58,748 --> 00:34:00,481
- There you are.
- Thanks.

644
00:34:03,953 --> 00:34:06,153
I didn't know you worked
out so much, Mr. Keller.

645
00:34:06,156 --> 00:34:09,223
I mean, Archie Andrews, watch your back.

646
00:34:09,225 --> 00:34:10,624
I don't do it for vanity.

647
00:34:10,626 --> 00:34:12,626
I do it for discipline,
and to push my limits.

648
00:34:12,628 --> 00:34:15,663
- And I'm sure it comes in handy on the job.
- Yeah.

649
00:34:15,666 --> 00:34:19,500
Kevin mentioned things
have been stressful lately,

650
00:34:19,502 --> 00:34:21,402
with the Black Hood and everything.

651
00:34:21,404 --> 00:34:24,071
It must get super hard.

652
00:34:25,775 --> 00:34:28,442
With all the pressure,
without Mrs. Keller.

653
00:34:28,445 --> 00:34:30,811
Where is she stationed, again?

654
00:34:30,813 --> 00:34:33,247
Bahrain. Uh, some Naval Base there.

655
00:34:33,249 --> 00:34:34,615
That can't be easy.

656
00:34:34,617 --> 00:34:36,050
How do you...

657
00:34:36,053 --> 00:34:37,552
Cope?

658
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:40,067
Veronica?

659
00:34:40,824 --> 00:34:42,257
What are you doing down here?

660
00:34:43,826 --> 00:34:44,992
Hey, pal.

661
00:35:12,655 --> 00:35:16,056
I saw Kevin's dad sneaking
out in the middle of the night,

662
00:35:16,059 --> 00:35:18,359
and he came home, like, at 4:00 a.m.

663
00:35:20,162 --> 00:35:21,428
Look.

664
00:35:23,399 --> 00:35:27,935
A Jingle-Jangle addict's body was
found by the tracks this morning.

665
00:35:27,938 --> 00:35:31,505
It says here this guy was
hit and killed by a train.

666
00:35:31,508 --> 00:35:33,840
Yeah, because he was
pushed in front of it

667
00:35:33,843 --> 00:35:35,075
by Sheriff Keller.

668
00:35:35,077 --> 00:35:36,944
Or he stumbled into its path.

669
00:35:36,946 --> 00:35:40,486
No, think about all the locked
doors in his house... Why?

670
00:35:40,489 --> 00:35:42,750
- Why?
- Because he's a private person.

671
00:35:42,753 --> 00:35:44,718
Look, Betty, let's not confuse

672
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,620
wanting a solution to this mystery

673
00:35:46,622 --> 00:35:48,188
with actually having one, okay?

674
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,724
This is Kevin's father
we're talking about.

675
00:37:20,249 --> 00:37:21,849
Betty?

676
00:37:23,045 --> 00:37:24,651
What are you doing here?

677
00:37:28,629 --> 00:37:30,329
Thanks for calling, Tom.

678
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:31,897
That's okay, Hal.

679
00:37:31,899 --> 00:37:35,334
And as for Betty, I... I apologize.

680
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:39,071
I mean, accusing you
of being the Black Hood.

681
00:37:39,073 --> 00:37:40,839
I can't imagine where she got that idea.

682
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:44,176
Well, she found my research
on the case, and, uh,

683
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:47,079
the black hood that I pulled
out of Archie's locker.

684
00:37:47,081 --> 00:37:48,514
With an overactive imagination,

685
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,649
I can see how it could
look a certain way.

686
00:37:51,819 --> 00:37:53,419
This is my log book.

687
00:37:53,422 --> 00:37:55,321
Go ahead and flip through it.

688
00:37:59,244 --> 00:38:02,578
When Fred was shot, I
was processing a perp.

689
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:07,824
When Midge and Moose were
attacked, I was patrolling downtown.

690
00:38:07,836 --> 00:38:10,227
And I was right here in the station when

691
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:12,445
Ms. Grundy was murdered in Greendale.

692
00:38:12,448 --> 00:38:13,814
Graveyard shift.

693
00:38:16,624 --> 00:38:18,277
Betty, I'm not going to say anything

694
00:38:18,279 --> 00:38:19,878
to Kevin about what happened.

695
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:23,382
You've been a very good friend to him.

696
00:38:25,086 --> 00:38:26,752
I think this would break his heart.

697
00:38:28,022 --> 00:38:29,521
Thanks, Tom.

698
00:38:30,424 --> 00:38:32,191
I know you think I'm crazy, Vee,

699
00:38:32,193 --> 00:38:34,360
but you yourself, saw him sneaking out.

700
00:38:34,362 --> 00:38:37,096
- He's hiding something.
- Okay, Bee.

701
00:38:37,099 --> 00:38:39,698
I'm in, for Kevin's sake.

702
00:38:39,701 --> 00:38:41,734
And also to keep you in check.

703
00:38:50,311 --> 00:38:52,344
Look. Look, look, look!

704
00:38:55,116 --> 00:38:57,483
Where-oh-where do you
think you're going, Sheriff?

705
00:39:07,294 --> 00:39:09,828
- There he is.
- What is he doing?

706
00:39:09,831 --> 00:39:11,951
That must be his kill kit.

707
00:39:11,954 --> 00:39:13,486
His what now?

708
00:39:16,537 --> 00:39:18,137
He's about to do something terrible.

709
00:39:18,139 --> 00:39:20,439
His next victim could be
in that room right now.

710
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:21,774
Should we call the cops?

711
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,709
Betty?

712
00:39:23,711 --> 00:39:25,611
Betty!

713
00:39:33,154 --> 00:39:35,269
- What the hell are you doing?
- Shh.

714
00:39:53,274 --> 00:39:56,008
I just can't believe this. I'm in shock.

715
00:39:56,011 --> 00:39:57,309
Me, too.

716
00:39:57,945 --> 00:39:59,445
My woman's intuition told me

717
00:39:59,447 --> 00:40:01,747
Sheriff Keller was having an affair,

718
00:40:01,749 --> 00:40:03,449
but with Mayor McCoy?

719
00:40:04,518 --> 00:40:07,252
Oh, God. Riverdale's list
of sinners keeps expanding.

720
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:11,423
Hey, look, it's the boys.
Shall we ask them to join?

721
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:16,961
On second thought, it looks like
they're having an intense broment.

722
00:40:16,964 --> 00:40:19,631
Veronica, how are we gonna
tell Kevin about this?

723
00:40:19,633 --> 00:40:21,166
I don't think we do.

724
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:24,703
I think this is one of
those secrets we keep.

725
00:40:25,573 --> 00:40:27,139
For Kevin's sake.

726
00:40:28,108 --> 00:40:29,808
Let him keep thinking
his dad's a good guy.

727
00:40:37,051 --> 00:40:38,517
There, there.

728
00:40:39,053 --> 00:40:40,686
Drink your tea, Josie.

729
00:40:43,057 --> 00:40:45,591
Do you want a ride home?
It's practically dawn.

730
00:40:45,594 --> 00:40:46,927
No, uh,

731
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:49,328
visiting hours start at sunup.

732
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:51,830
I'm gonna visit my dad.

733
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:04,042
Hello. Pop's!

734
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,560
That was him on the phone.

735
00:41:23,631 --> 00:41:25,297
The Black Hood.

736
00:41:28,718 --> 00:41:31,385
He says that we've failed his test.

737
00:41:33,374 --> 00:41:34,840
That we're all sinners.

738
00:41:38,869 --> 00:41:41,145
That the reckoning is upon us.

739
