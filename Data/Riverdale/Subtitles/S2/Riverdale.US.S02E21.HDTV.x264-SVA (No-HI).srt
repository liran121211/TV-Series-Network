1
00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:02,796
- Previously on Riverdale:
- The Conway Murders?

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,048
- They were a family of five.
- I found justice.

3
00:00:05,132 --> 00:00:09,636
What if Mr. Svenson wasn't the Black Hood?
The Black Hood could be alive.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,889
My dad, he might be the Black Hood.

5
00:00:11,972 --> 00:00:15,559
Don't know. I've seen your father
sneak around Thistlehouse.

6
00:00:16,143 --> 00:00:17,102
Lodge is a problem.

7
00:00:17,686 --> 00:00:20,481
Did you have anything to do
with Poppa Poutine's death?

8
00:00:20,564 --> 00:00:22,149
Small Fry is looking for payback.

9
00:00:22,858 --> 00:00:26,278
Penny, you wanna deal drugs?
It's not gonna be with the Serpents.

10
00:00:26,361 --> 00:00:29,406
- That used to be my Serpent tattoo.
- You nuts? She will be back.

11
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,036
Our adversaries, the Ghoulies, have
been released. They want Serpent blood.

12
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:35,287
Midge?

13
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:38,624
- You're dead!
- Mr. Fogarty. Come with us.

14
00:00:38,707 --> 00:00:40,709
- I didn't kill her.
- Didn't you?

15
00:00:40,792 --> 00:00:44,254
His release is going
to make a lot of people very unhappy.

16
00:00:44,338 --> 00:00:47,758
- The Circle is disbanded.
- You're not paying us. Hiram is.

17
00:00:47,841 --> 00:00:50,344
- Fangs Fogarty is being released.
- What?

18
00:00:51,553 --> 00:00:54,473
They wanna rip Fangs apart.
We need help, Archie.

19
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:02,105
Okay, Dad. Let's talk.

20
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:04,858
I swear, Mother.
If this is one of your callers...

21
00:01:47,943 --> 00:01:53,323
I suggest you run whilst you still can.
I only miss when I mean to.

22
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,503
Help us! We need a doctor!

23
00:02:07,045 --> 00:02:08,547
- Ma'am.
- Wait your turn.

24
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,965
- He was shot.
- Step back...

25
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:12,384
- He's dying!
- Hey! What's going on here?

26
00:02:12,968 --> 00:02:15,470
- My friend was shot.
- Hey, get me a gurney.

27
00:02:16,889 --> 00:02:18,056
Be careful.

28
00:02:19,558 --> 00:02:20,475
Let's go.

29
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:22,686
Hang in there. Hang in there.

30
00:02:25,355 --> 00:02:27,774
- Where are you going?
- To find the guy who shot Fangs.

31
00:02:27,858 --> 00:02:29,776
You're not going. Not with people rioting.

32
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,113
You're angry, you want justice? So do I.
You've got a fallen soldier,

33
00:02:33,196 --> 00:02:36,199
and we need to talk to his family.
That's part of being a leader.

34
00:02:36,283 --> 00:02:38,827
- Some leader I am.
- Don't go down that road.

35
00:02:39,578 --> 00:02:41,705
All right. Come on. Come on.

36
00:03:01,975 --> 00:03:02,809
Cheryl?

37
00:03:02,893 --> 00:03:05,103
The Black Hood just attacked me.

38
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:06,313
Oh, my God.

39
00:03:07,314 --> 00:03:08,482
Was it my dad?

40
00:03:08,565 --> 00:03:11,234
Based on waistline,
it could've been him, yes.

41
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:14,279
Luckily, I was able to get
to my archery set and hunting cape.

42
00:03:14,363 --> 00:03:17,366
- You didn't kill him, did you?
- No. I shot to wound.

43
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:21,119
Hit him in the right shoulder. He's fled
into the woods where I plan to track him.

44
00:03:21,203 --> 00:03:24,581
Just in case he escapes my clutches,
be forewarned:

45
00:03:24,665 --> 00:03:28,043
Now that he's a maimed animal,
he's operating on instinct,

46
00:03:28,335 --> 00:03:32,130
ready to lash out
and kill anyone in his path.

47
00:03:32,214 --> 00:03:33,465
Even his loved ones.

48
00:03:35,926 --> 00:03:37,177
Here, include that.

49
00:03:40,222 --> 00:03:42,224
- Elizabeth, thank goodness.
- Mom.

50
00:03:42,307 --> 00:03:45,185
- Are you okay? Have you seen Dad?
- He's out covering the riots.

51
00:03:45,268 --> 00:03:48,271
Where are you? The streets aren't safe.
You need to get here.

52
00:03:48,355 --> 00:03:51,358
- I'm on my way, but stay put, okay?
- I'm not going anywhere.

53
00:03:51,441 --> 00:03:54,319
It's a big night for The Register.
If it bleeds, it leads.

54
00:03:54,403 --> 00:03:55,737
Get over here now.

55
00:03:58,615 --> 00:04:01,785
- Hey, Arch...
- It's just me, Mr. Andrews.

56
00:04:01,868 --> 00:04:04,413
I was about to slip out.
Is something wrong?

57
00:04:04,496 --> 00:04:07,874
On the news, it said a riot broke out
down at the sheriff's station.

58
00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:09,960
Where is Archie?

59
00:04:12,045 --> 00:04:14,006
- Where's Reggie?
- I thought he was with you.

60
00:04:14,089 --> 00:04:18,927
We got separated. Reggie had a gun.
He didn't shoot Fangs. I tackled him.

61
00:04:19,011 --> 00:04:21,680
- Why have a gun?
- I can guess who put the idea in his head.

62
00:04:21,763 --> 00:04:23,181
But we gotta find him.

63
00:04:23,265 --> 00:04:26,560
Some Serpents saw Reggie with the gun.
They're gonna go after him.

64
00:04:26,643 --> 00:04:28,520
Kev, Moose. We'll head to Reggie's house.

65
00:04:28,603 --> 00:04:30,689
Everyone else, fan out.
Call if you find him.

66
00:04:32,524 --> 00:04:34,776
Archie was there
when that Serpent got shot.

67
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,071
- I don't know what he's caught up in.
- I'm coming with you.

68
00:04:43,201 --> 00:04:46,121
Good evening, Mr. Andrews.
I'm here to pick up Miss Lodge.

69
00:04:48,123 --> 00:04:50,876
Thank you, Andre.
Yes. Bring her directly home.

70
00:04:52,252 --> 00:04:55,964
Okay. Now that we know Veronica's safe,
one of Minetta's deputies

71
00:04:56,048 --> 00:04:58,675
will take you over to The Register.
Alice is waiting.

72
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:01,720
There's no way of controlling
what could happen.

73
00:05:01,803 --> 00:05:03,346
Hiram, it's a huge gamble.

74
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,933
No, the fire's started, mi amor.
Chaos is good for us.

75
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,272
We have the pieces in place
to restore order. Fred doesn't.

76
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:14,399
Andre will keep watch on Veronica.

77
00:05:20,739 --> 00:05:23,658
- Where will you be?
- Out with another deputy.

78
00:05:24,868 --> 00:05:25,702
Hiram.

79
00:05:30,957 --> 00:05:33,543
You're not keeping anything from me,
right?

80
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:37,714
Don't start doubting me now.

81
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:49,100
- Excuse me. How's Fangs?
- He's still in surgery.

82
00:05:49,184 --> 00:05:51,311
I wanna talk to him
as soon as he wakes up.

83
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:53,355
Sheriff Minetta.

84
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:58,318
- Shouldn't you looking for who shot Fangs?
- There's a manhunt underway.

85
00:05:58,568 --> 00:06:01,112
Your Serpent pals
aren't making things easy.

86
00:06:01,196 --> 00:06:04,741
Rioting, carousing, terrorizing.
Already arrested a few.

87
00:06:04,825 --> 00:06:08,495
Fangs wouldn't have a slug in his gut
if you had done your job.

88
00:06:08,578 --> 00:06:10,580
I don't know the details of your parole,

89
00:06:10,664 --> 00:06:13,542
but I'm certain harassing an officer
would violate them.

90
00:06:16,628 --> 00:06:17,462
Jug?

91
00:06:17,546 --> 00:06:19,881
Mr. Lodge. It's me, Reggie.

92
00:06:20,549 --> 00:06:23,760
I need your help. Someone shot Fangs.
It wasn't me.

93
00:06:23,844 --> 00:06:26,346
But I was there
and the Southsiders think I did it.

94
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:29,432
That's unfortunate, Reggie.
But I'm afraid I can't help you.

95
00:06:40,068 --> 00:06:42,237
Oh, my God... Is that Mrs. Klump?

96
00:06:43,822 --> 00:06:45,240
Andre, stop the car.

97
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,742
That's Midge's mom.

98
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,457
- Miss Veronica, wait.
- Mrs. Klump?

99
00:06:56,877 --> 00:07:00,130
- Are you okay?
- I may have killed that boy.

100
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,719
Archie, what is going on?

101
00:07:05,802 --> 00:07:09,639
- The Serpents are going nuts.
- Yeah. Reggie shot Fangs.

102
00:07:09,723 --> 00:07:13,518
No, I was with Reggie. It wasn't him.
You need to call off your crew.

103
00:07:13,602 --> 00:07:15,061
We're leaving Reggie's house.

104
00:07:15,145 --> 00:07:17,522
- They find him?
- No. We're headed to the school.

105
00:07:17,606 --> 00:07:20,817
- That's where Mrs. Mantle said they were.
- Okay. I'm on my way.

106
00:07:21,401 --> 00:07:24,613
- Whenever you're ready.
- As a mayoral candidate,

107
00:07:25,113 --> 00:07:27,949
it's important to take charge
in times of crisis.

108
00:07:28,992 --> 00:07:30,076
Like this riot,

109
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,496
which I believe was brought about
by the actions of the Black Hood.

110
00:07:34,164 --> 00:07:37,334
Which is why I would like to offer
a bounty.

111
00:07:38,418 --> 00:07:42,088
One million dollars to whomever
can deliver the Black Hood.

112
00:07:42,797 --> 00:07:45,675
Alive or preferably dead.

113
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,230
<font color="#800080">Synced & corrected by</font> <font color="#00FFFF">MaxPayne</font>

114
00:07:54,161 --> 00:07:58,332
A bounty? What are you talking about?
Is that even legal?

115
00:07:58,415 --> 00:08:01,877
The Black Hood is a shooter
on the streets of Riverdale.

116
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,506
- He tried to kill one of your classmates...
- No. The Black Hood did not shoot Fangs.

117
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:09,051
Excuse me, how would you know that?

118
00:08:09,134 --> 00:08:11,637
Did anyone see the Black Hood
at the sheriff's station?

119
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,306
Why are you being protective
of a murderer?

120
00:08:17,309 --> 00:08:19,019
Cheryl. Any new leads?

121
00:08:19,394 --> 00:08:21,730
- Where are you?
- At The Register. Why?

122
00:08:21,813 --> 00:08:25,067
He's exited the forest and headed
for the houses beyond the pines.

123
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,360
Maybe even yours.

124
00:08:26,443 --> 00:08:28,195
- I have to go.
- Wait, cousin.

125
00:08:28,278 --> 00:08:31,114
Do not go into that house alone.

126
00:08:31,198 --> 00:08:33,867
I have to find my dad
before anyone else does.

127
00:08:33,951 --> 00:08:36,036
Otherwise, he's a dead man walking.

128
00:08:43,377 --> 00:08:45,087
That's gotta be Southsiders.

129
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:48,924
- Serpent scum.
- Settle down. We're outmanned and unarmed.

130
00:08:49,007 --> 00:08:51,343
- I'm not gonna hide.
- I'm with Moose.

131
00:08:51,426 --> 00:08:54,388
All right, but it's us
against who knows how many.

132
00:08:54,471 --> 00:08:57,307
So, if we're gonna do this,
we gotta gear up.

133
00:09:04,606 --> 00:09:06,984
Ronnie, can I call you back?
A riot broke out.

134
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:10,279
Yes, Archie, I know.
I was out in the middle of it.

135
00:09:10,362 --> 00:09:12,072
I thought you were at my house.

136
00:09:12,155 --> 00:09:17,160
Not only did I brave the streets,
I delivered Fangs' shooter, Mrs. Klump,

137
00:09:17,244 --> 00:09:19,454
- to the authorities.
- Mrs. Klump shot Fangs?

138
00:09:19,538 --> 00:09:22,332
- Can you blame her?
- I gotta tell the Serpents.

139
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,626
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

140
00:09:28,964 --> 00:09:31,717
Mom? Sheriff Minetta.

141
00:09:32,342 --> 00:09:35,304
Veronica. What are you doing?
You're supposed to be at home.

142
00:09:35,387 --> 00:09:37,806
Andre's in the car.
We had to make a detour.

143
00:09:38,932 --> 00:09:40,851
Good Lord, Mom.

144
00:09:40,934 --> 00:09:44,479
Are you and Daddy trying to turn Riverdale
into Gotham City?

145
00:09:51,236 --> 00:09:52,821
Serpents! Stop!

146
00:09:54,406 --> 00:09:57,659
Well, fellas. Looks like we found
some bulldogs to put down.

147
00:09:58,827 --> 00:10:01,830
Sweet Pea. I swear,
Reggie didn't shoot Fangs.

148
00:10:01,913 --> 00:10:04,041
- It was Mrs. Klump.
- I saw Mantle with a gun.

149
00:10:04,124 --> 00:10:07,336
Then you saw me tackle him
before he got a shot off.

150
00:10:07,419 --> 00:10:09,713
It was Midge's mom.
She's down at the station.

151
00:10:10,297 --> 00:10:12,090
And Fangs is clinging to life.

152
00:10:12,466 --> 00:10:15,510
Whether it was Reggie or Mrs. Klump
who pulled the trigger,

153
00:10:15,594 --> 00:10:18,263
a Northsider put him there!
You took our friend.

154
00:10:19,222 --> 00:10:20,098
Our land.

155
00:10:21,099 --> 00:10:23,518
You'll take everything
if we give you the chance.

156
00:10:26,063 --> 00:10:30,233
So, now you get to watch
as we burn your school to the ground.

157
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:51,254
What do you boys think
you're doing to my school?

158
00:10:55,008 --> 00:10:57,219
Hello? Dad?

159
00:11:09,106 --> 00:11:09,940
Dad.

160
00:11:14,111 --> 00:11:17,531
- You're too late, Jughead.
- Try Mad Max-ing your way through a riot.

161
00:11:17,614 --> 00:11:19,616
- What happened?
- Weatherbee shut us down.

162
00:11:19,699 --> 00:11:22,285
- Kicked our asses out.
- The Serpents took off again.

163
00:11:22,369 --> 00:11:23,829
- Where?
- They went down Fernleaf.

164
00:11:23,912 --> 00:11:25,914
- Midge Klump's house.
- Why there?

165
00:11:25,997 --> 00:11:28,917
To trash it. I told them Mrs. Klump
shot Fangs, not Reggie.

166
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:31,670
Jughead, you have to coax them
off the ledge.

167
00:11:31,753 --> 00:11:33,338
- I'm on it.
- Wait.

168
00:11:34,422 --> 00:11:37,551
- Have you spoken to Betty?
- She's with her mom. Keep in touch.

169
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,386
You, too.

170
00:11:43,807 --> 00:11:45,475
- Hello?
- Archie, it's Pop.

171
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:49,521
I've got a friend of yours here.
I think he needs help.

172
00:12:07,497 --> 00:12:08,498
Hello?

173
00:12:08,582 --> 00:12:11,960
Betty, it's FP. I'm at Riverdale General.
Is Jug with you?

174
00:12:12,043 --> 00:12:15,005
Mr. Jones. No, I don't know where he is.

175
00:12:15,088 --> 00:12:17,299
If you see him,
tell him I'm looking for him.

176
00:12:17,382 --> 00:12:18,466
Of course I will.

177
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:22,554
Also, uh, Betty, they just brought
your old man into to ER.

178
00:12:22,637 --> 00:12:23,471
My dad?

179
00:12:24,681 --> 00:12:26,808
Is he hurt badly?

180
00:12:26,892 --> 00:12:29,603
He's bleeding quite a bit.
You want me to check on him?

181
00:12:29,686 --> 00:12:32,564
No. That's okay, Mr. Jones. I'm on my way.

182
00:12:32,647 --> 00:12:36,610
Where do you plan on getting the million
dollars to pay for this lunatic bounty?

183
00:12:36,693 --> 00:12:40,155
- Your father has secret funds.
- My ass he does.

184
00:12:40,238 --> 00:12:43,992
If Daddy thinks he can use my money
for one of his Machiavellian ploys,

185
00:12:44,075 --> 00:12:48,121
he better think again, because I'm taking
back what I got from the St. Claire.

186
00:12:48,205 --> 00:12:51,708
Your father already told you.
He put that money in a trust for you.

187
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,376
He stole it, you mean.

188
00:12:57,214 --> 00:12:59,633
Veronica! Veronica!

189
00:13:00,717 --> 00:13:03,762
You're wasting your time.
Your money is not in there.

190
00:13:04,846 --> 00:13:07,849
Veronica, just open the door
and we can talk about this.

191
00:13:46,388 --> 00:13:47,973
I didn't know where else to go.

192
00:13:48,431 --> 00:13:50,517
- Mr. Lodge left me hanging.
- Wait, Reggie.

193
00:13:51,351 --> 00:13:53,478
I know he paid you
to trash the Whyte Wyrm.

194
00:13:54,062 --> 00:13:56,898
- But did he put you up to this?
- Guys. Outside.

195
00:13:59,567 --> 00:14:01,027
Fight! Fight! Fight!

196
00:14:02,612 --> 00:14:04,406
Serpents. They're coming for me.

197
00:14:07,367 --> 00:14:09,869
- What's up?
- Jughead, where are you guys?

198
00:14:09,953 --> 00:14:13,498
Just got the Serpents back to the Wyrm.
Mrs. Klump's house is secure.

199
00:14:14,207 --> 00:14:15,041
What's wrong?

200
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,836
If the Serpents are with you,
then who is out here at Pop's?

201
00:14:20,922 --> 00:14:21,756
Oh, crap.

202
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:27,345
Jug, looks like the Ghoulies
are back in town.

203
00:14:41,086 --> 00:14:43,755
Damn it. Nobody's answering
at the sheriff's station.

204
00:14:44,256 --> 00:14:47,801
Looks like we're on our own.
We should be fine, as long as everybody...

205
00:14:48,176 --> 00:14:50,387
Everybody get away from the windows!

206
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:53,390
Stay down!

207
00:14:59,813 --> 00:15:02,065
- Do you have a gun in here, Pop?
- No.

208
00:15:02,608 --> 00:15:07,654
I had my fill of gunfire back in the war.
But I learned a trick in the riots of '79.

209
00:15:07,738 --> 00:15:10,532
I have Mr. Lodge's leftover liquor
from poker night.

210
00:15:10,616 --> 00:15:13,160
If you can get to the roof
through the crawlspace...

211
00:15:13,243 --> 00:15:15,120
I like how you're thinking, Pop.

212
00:15:18,248 --> 00:15:20,626
Anyone, come out and play!

213
00:15:21,918 --> 00:15:24,296
We got some new toys to show you.

214
00:15:24,379 --> 00:15:25,714
Hey!

215
00:15:36,099 --> 00:15:37,017
Come on.

216
00:15:38,101 --> 00:15:38,935
Hit me!

217
00:15:49,446 --> 00:15:51,615
All right, now it's a party.

218
00:15:54,242 --> 00:15:56,244
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

219
00:16:00,624 --> 00:16:01,750
Get out of here.

220
00:16:06,922 --> 00:16:10,050
- Mr. Keller, I thought you resigned.
- I turned in my badge,

221
00:16:10,133 --> 00:16:12,928
- but not the cruiser yet.
- How did you know we're here?

222
00:16:13,011 --> 00:16:14,971
Jug called, said you were in trouble.

223
00:16:15,055 --> 00:16:17,182
I called your dad.
Right when Kevin called.

224
00:16:17,724 --> 00:16:20,060
We're not letting this town
go down without a fight.

225
00:16:20,143 --> 00:16:22,145
Hot Riverdale Dads to the rescue.

226
00:16:23,105 --> 00:16:27,234
- I can't just sit here.
- Sweet Pea. You're staying put!

227
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:30,278
You said it yourself.
The Ghoulies are back.

228
00:16:30,362 --> 00:16:33,782
We will deal with them.
As soon as my dad gets back...

229
00:16:33,865 --> 00:16:37,035
You're not our leader all of a sudden?
That's right.

230
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,705
- You're just the guy that got Fangs shot.
- Watch it.

231
00:16:39,788 --> 00:16:42,833
Fangs might die.
The Ghoulies are out for our blood,

232
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:45,085
because of a drag race you started.

233
00:16:46,628 --> 00:16:49,589
An hour.
That's all I'm asking for, Sweet Pea.

234
00:16:57,013 --> 00:16:58,724
This is utterly vile.

235
00:16:58,807 --> 00:17:02,644
Daddy has written the story
about the affair you and Fred had.

236
00:17:02,728 --> 00:17:05,647
What was he planning to do,
publish that in The Register,

237
00:17:05,731 --> 00:17:07,899
and drag you both through the mud?

238
00:17:07,983 --> 00:17:12,654
Fred's running on family values.
I'm the law and order candidate.

239
00:17:12,738 --> 00:17:16,575
Your father believes an October Surprise
would hurt me,

240
00:17:16,658 --> 00:17:20,287
but I'd survive, and it would utterly
destroy Fred's campaign.

241
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:23,123
- You were in on this?
- There's a game plan.

242
00:17:23,206 --> 00:17:26,168
What kind of man would do this
to his own wife?

243
00:17:26,251 --> 00:17:30,297
I'll tell you. The kind of man who always
has someone else to take the risk,

244
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,550
to stand in the line of fire,
to run for mayor.

245
00:17:35,635 --> 00:17:40,140
That's what you are to him.
A means to an end. Kindling for the fire.

246
00:17:40,223 --> 00:17:42,142
Oh, no, Veronica.

247
00:17:42,225 --> 00:17:44,811
Your father would never put us
in harm's way.

248
00:17:44,895 --> 00:17:48,607
The fact that you still believe that,
after everything he's done,

249
00:17:49,024 --> 00:17:50,859
chills me, Mom.

250
00:17:52,986 --> 00:17:55,614
Pop Tate. I heard there was an incident
at the diner.

251
00:17:55,697 --> 00:17:57,282
Rioters were here.

252
00:17:57,365 --> 00:18:01,661
But Fred Andrews showed up with Tom Keller
and FP Jones. They saved us.

253
00:18:01,745 --> 00:18:04,456
Helped defend the Chock'lit Shoppe
from the Ghoulies.

254
00:18:04,539 --> 00:18:06,500
- Everyone's calling them heroes.
- I see.

255
00:18:07,876 --> 00:18:09,336
Thank you, Pop. And, uh...

256
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,880
- I'm glad you're okay.
- All right.

257
00:18:18,386 --> 00:18:21,139
Sorry. We're not serving right now.

258
00:18:22,641 --> 00:18:25,352
That wasn't Hiram Lodge
you were speaking with, was it?

259
00:18:26,019 --> 00:18:26,853
It was.

260
00:18:26,937 --> 00:18:28,647
He's an old friend of my father's.

261
00:18:29,523 --> 00:18:32,275
Wouldn't happen to know
where he lives, would you?

262
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,778
Excuse me.

263
00:18:35,487 --> 00:18:38,698
Um, my dad is here. Hal Cooper.
What room is he in?

264
00:18:38,907 --> 00:18:39,783
Uh...

265
00:18:40,033 --> 00:18:42,410
- Two-twenty one, just down the hall.
- Thank you.

266
00:18:52,879 --> 00:18:54,297
Dad.

267
00:18:57,759 --> 00:18:58,760
Oh.

268
00:19:09,354 --> 00:19:11,356
We keep missing each other.

269
00:19:13,608 --> 00:19:18,738
- You murdered Dr. Masters.
- He asked too many questions.

270
00:19:18,822 --> 00:19:21,950
There's no method to the killing now?
No grand design?

271
00:19:22,033 --> 00:19:25,495
- You're just a run-of-the-mill psychopath?
- You need to come home,

272
00:19:25,954 --> 00:19:28,331
so we can talk and finish this.

273
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:29,833
Fine.

274
00:19:31,376 --> 00:19:32,794
You don't scare me.

275
00:19:34,004 --> 00:19:35,422
Your mother's here.

276
00:19:38,216 --> 00:19:39,050
What?

277
00:19:39,676 --> 00:19:42,095
- Mom's there?
- If you're not home in ten minutes,

278
00:19:42,178 --> 00:19:45,682
or if you call the police,
I will slit your mother's throat.

279
00:19:45,765 --> 00:19:46,766
No.

280
00:19:57,652 --> 00:20:01,781
- Hello?
- Hello, lover boy. It's your old gal pal.

281
00:20:02,365 --> 00:20:03,199
Penny.

282
00:20:04,492 --> 00:20:05,869
You picked a bad time.

283
00:20:05,952 --> 00:20:10,165
Oh, I heard. Riverdale,
burning to the ground. It's tragic.

284
00:20:10,248 --> 00:20:14,377
How about we meet up and talk about it?
Hmm? Your old hangout, by the docks?

285
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,922
- Why would I do that?
- If you don't,

286
00:20:17,005 --> 00:20:19,674
I'll start carving up
your girlfriend's face.

287
00:20:19,758 --> 00:20:23,845
- Betty?
- Oh, please! Ponytail's a snooze.

288
00:20:23,929 --> 00:20:27,390
No, I mean, your Southside Smurfette.

289
00:20:27,682 --> 00:20:31,102
- What do you think I should start with?
- Tell her to go to hell.

290
00:20:31,603 --> 00:20:34,105
Maybe her tongue? Hmm? Come now.

291
00:20:34,689 --> 00:20:37,651
And alone.
It'll just be me and Pinkie here.

292
00:20:38,902 --> 00:20:41,237
Mom? Mom, where are you?

293
00:20:41,321 --> 00:20:44,532
Betty. Thank God. I've been calling you.
Where have you been?

294
00:20:44,616 --> 00:20:46,076
Mom, is Dad here? Is he...?

295
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,994
- Yeah, honey. Why?
- Where is he?

296
00:20:48,078 --> 00:20:50,747
- What's going on? What?
- We have to leave. Let's go.

297
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,874
Betty! You made it home.

298
00:20:54,584 --> 00:20:59,172
Your dad has some crazy idea
to show us old home movies.

299
00:20:59,255 --> 00:21:02,842
I figured we indulge him, since we're
practically on lockdown anyway.

300
00:21:05,011 --> 00:21:05,887
What's wrong?

301
00:21:08,765 --> 00:21:10,934
Well, I'm just happy we're all here.

302
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:12,519
As a family.

303
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:17,107
Sit down, Betty.
I think you're really going to enjoy this.

304
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:33,225
I'm making this movie so we never
forget what your daddy sacrificed for us.

305
00:21:33,308 --> 00:21:35,811
You do love your daddy, don't you, Harold?

306
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:37,104
Yes, Mom.

307
00:21:37,187 --> 00:21:40,148
And you want your daddy
to keep living with us?

308
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:43,819
- Yes, Mom.
- I don't understand. What are we watching?

309
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:45,779
- Is that you, Hal?
- It is.

310
00:21:45,862 --> 00:21:48,949
Your daddy did something
very noble, Harold.

311
00:21:49,032 --> 00:21:52,285
He took care of that Conway family.
They were sinners.

312
00:21:52,369 --> 00:21:56,164
- And what happens to sinners?
- Sinners have to die.

313
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:58,875
- Oh, my God.
- What is this, a snuff film?

314
00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:02,713
Shut the hell up, Alice,
for once in your life.

315
00:22:02,796 --> 00:22:06,758
That's right.
Now, that little Conway boy who survived,

316
00:22:06,842 --> 00:22:09,511
they're gonna ask him
who killed his family.

317
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:13,724
He needs to point out somebody.
Anybody. But not Daddy.

318
00:22:13,807 --> 00:22:17,310
Because we don't want Daddy
to be taken away from us, do we?

319
00:22:17,394 --> 00:22:20,021
No, I love my daddy.

320
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:21,940
So, you have to help him.

321
00:22:22,023 --> 00:22:25,610
Make sure that when they ask
the Conway boy who he saw kill his family,

322
00:22:25,694 --> 00:22:30,323
make sure he doesn't say Daddy.
Can you do that, Harold? Convince him?

323
00:22:30,407 --> 00:22:31,992
I think so.

324
00:22:32,075 --> 00:22:36,872
You're a good boy, Hal.
Your father let him escape, but you?

325
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:40,125
You will do better. You must do better.

326
00:22:40,834 --> 00:22:43,462
Take out your tape recorder, Alice.

327
00:22:45,589 --> 00:22:47,382
I need you to record this.

328
00:22:49,926 --> 00:22:53,430
The Conways. The family that was
murdered 40 years ago?

329
00:22:53,513 --> 00:22:54,848
Yes. Oh, my God.

330
00:22:54,931 --> 00:22:56,308
Take it out!

331
00:22:59,394 --> 00:23:02,147
Now I wanna tell my story.

332
00:23:03,565 --> 00:23:05,776
No, our story, really.

333
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:09,613
First, to clear something up:

334
00:23:09,696 --> 00:23:14,951
Your Great-Grandpappy Cooper wasn't
murdered by his brother like some dog.

335
00:23:16,536 --> 00:23:17,829
He was the killer.

336
00:23:18,371 --> 00:23:22,292
He killed Great-Grandpappy Blossom
and then took on the Cooper name

337
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:24,836
to create a new identity for himself.

338
00:23:25,879 --> 00:23:26,880
For us.

339
00:23:27,589 --> 00:23:29,841
What does that have to do
with the Conways?

340
00:23:29,925 --> 00:23:31,676
The Conways knew our secret.

341
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,514
Mr. Conway blackmailed my father,
your grandpappy.

342
00:23:35,597 --> 00:23:37,224
So, Grandpa killed them.

343
00:23:37,808 --> 00:23:39,309
They were sinners, Betty.

344
00:23:39,392 --> 00:23:40,811
Even the children?

345
00:23:40,894 --> 00:23:44,272
Well, there was one survivor.
The Conways' boy Joseph.

346
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:45,482
Mr. Svenson.

347
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:49,361
Who you convinced to accuse
an innocent man.

348
00:23:49,444 --> 00:23:52,823
Joseph was easy to manipulate.

349
00:23:52,906 --> 00:23:57,035
- As a boy and as a man.
- What are you telling us? Hal? That...?

350
00:23:57,118 --> 00:23:59,037
That I have a darkness, Alice.

351
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,750
The same darkness my father had,
the same darkness his father had.

352
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:07,170
And now, it lives in Betty.

353
00:24:07,754 --> 00:24:08,630
No.

354
00:24:09,798 --> 00:24:11,007
Our daughter.

355
00:24:27,357 --> 00:24:28,733
Who am I, Betty?

356
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,278
Say it.

357
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:34,531
Say who I am!

358
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,955
You're the Black Hood.

359
00:24:46,543 --> 00:24:47,544
That's right.

360
00:24:49,671 --> 00:24:51,047
Now say what I did.

361
00:24:54,676 --> 00:24:59,055
You... shot Mr. Andrews.

362
00:24:59,139 --> 00:25:01,850
You... killed Ms. Grundy...

363
00:25:02,809 --> 00:25:06,271
the Sugarman, Midge, Dr. Masters.

364
00:25:08,356 --> 00:25:10,650
- But, the debate...
- Was not me.

365
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,778
I can't take credit for that.

366
00:25:15,697 --> 00:25:20,285
- How's Veronica doing with all this?
- She's in lockdown at The Pembrooke.

367
00:25:20,368 --> 00:25:23,204
For all of Mr. Lodge's talk
about law and order,

368
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:25,290
he was nowhere to be seen tonight.

369
00:25:25,373 --> 00:25:28,376
I just went out to try to find you.
I'm gonna take a shower.

370
00:25:28,877 --> 00:25:29,878
I'm gonna lock up.

371
00:26:33,066 --> 00:26:34,150
Are you okay?

372
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:37,112
Thought about going pro after high school.

373
00:26:38,655 --> 00:26:39,739
- Dad!
- What?

374
00:26:40,323 --> 00:26:41,574
No!

375
00:26:46,121 --> 00:26:48,039
Dad. Dad.

376
00:26:49,124 --> 00:26:53,962
I'm good. Tom Keller made us put these on
before we went to the diner.

377
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:55,255
I'm good.

378
00:26:55,338 --> 00:26:57,465
No. Archie, no!

379
00:27:09,811 --> 00:27:12,397
Dad, why did you become the Black Hood?

380
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,401
Because this is a town of sinners, Betty.

381
00:27:17,027 --> 00:27:17,861
And...

382
00:27:19,946 --> 00:27:21,865
Sinners have to die.

383
00:27:21,948 --> 00:27:23,616
Your speech at the Jubilee...

384
00:27:24,701 --> 00:27:28,663
Riverdale must do better.
We must do better.

385
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:32,125
You will do better. You must do better.

386
00:27:32,208 --> 00:27:35,545
Reminded me of a promise
that I made my mother.

387
00:27:35,628 --> 00:27:40,008
That this town will do better.
We must do better.

388
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:42,510
So, I picked up my father's sword

389
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:47,265
and I continued the work
that he and my grandfather started.

390
00:27:49,851 --> 00:27:51,186
The purging of sin.

391
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:53,897
No. None of this makes any sense.

392
00:27:57,192 --> 00:27:59,319
Dad, why did you want this recorded?

393
00:27:59,402 --> 00:28:02,989
I want everyone to understand
when they find us.

394
00:28:11,081 --> 00:28:12,499
Hiya, Jones.

395
00:28:15,668 --> 00:28:18,004
Toni. Are you okay?

396
00:28:18,588 --> 00:28:20,757
Jughead, she's not alone.

397
00:28:23,176 --> 00:28:24,219
Surprise!

398
00:28:27,931 --> 00:28:30,058
You said it was gonna be
the two of us.

399
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:33,561
I never go without backup anymore.
Not after what you did to me.

400
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:35,814
Besides, we need to talk.

401
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,400
All of us.

402
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:40,026
There's nothing to talk about.

403
00:28:41,027 --> 00:28:43,863
- I'm taking Toni and we're leaving.
- Not so fast.

404
00:28:44,447 --> 00:28:47,283
I've been waiting to see you again
for a long time.

405
00:28:48,451 --> 00:28:50,203
Get back, you hobgoblin.

406
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:58,002
I brought backup, too. Like I said,
I'm taking Toni and we're leaving.

407
00:28:59,587 --> 00:29:02,507
Untie her, you Serpent hag.

408
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:07,345
Take her then.

409
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:12,100
But remember, when all your friends
are dead, I tried giving you a chance.

410
00:29:18,773 --> 00:29:21,192
Why do you keep coming back?
What do you want?

411
00:29:21,276 --> 00:29:25,822
The Southside. There's money
to be made here in The Town With Pep.

412
00:29:26,489 --> 00:29:28,950
If you're not afraid of
getting your hands dirty.

413
00:29:29,617 --> 00:29:32,745
You partnered with the Ghoulies
to sell drugs on the Southside.

414
00:29:32,829 --> 00:29:38,042
Bingo. So, here's the offer I want you
to take back to your dad and your tribe.

415
00:29:39,127 --> 00:29:40,920
The Serpents ship out tonight,

416
00:29:41,004 --> 00:29:43,673
or it's a showdown
with the Ghoulies at Pickens Park.

417
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:49,512
I'm fine either way.

418
00:30:02,317 --> 00:30:04,819
Hello. I'm here to see Mr. Lodge.

419
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:09,032
I'm sorry, he's not available.

420
00:30:10,158 --> 00:30:12,744
Are his lovely wife and beautiful daughter
at home?

421
00:30:15,872 --> 00:30:19,375
This is a game of nerves,
and clearly you've lost yours.

422
00:30:19,459 --> 00:30:24,506
I would rather have lost my nerve than my
mind, which clearly you and Daddy have.

423
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:29,719
That October Surprise wouldn't destroy
Fred's campaign, it would ruin his life.

424
00:30:33,973 --> 00:30:35,433
Oh, God. Who is it?

425
00:30:47,195 --> 00:30:50,323
You may know my father.
Goes by the name Poppa Poutine.

426
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:53,409
He told me if he was ever to be murdered,

427
00:30:53,493 --> 00:30:55,954
not to take the life of the man
who killed him,

428
00:30:56,037 --> 00:30:59,499
but to take the lives of those
that man loved the most.

429
00:30:59,582 --> 00:31:01,960
- Mom.
- Mija, run! Run!

430
00:31:12,178 --> 00:31:13,555
Stay behind me.

431
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:42,333
It's time we end the Ghoulie scourge,
and that traitor Penny Peabody.

432
00:31:42,417 --> 00:31:44,752
- Permanently.
- Sweet Pea, two hours ago,

433
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:47,088
your fight was with Reggie Mantle.

434
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:51,467
Now you want us to go to war over
territory we don't even control anymore?

435
00:31:51,551 --> 00:31:54,012
This is Hiram Lodge's problem, not ours.

436
00:31:54,095 --> 00:31:56,889
You're gonna hand over
Sunnyside Trailer Park

437
00:31:56,973 --> 00:32:00,560
- to Penny and the Ghoulies?
- Toni, I don't want us to die.

438
00:32:00,643 --> 00:32:03,479
A rumble with the Ghoulies?
It's a suicide-run.

439
00:32:03,563 --> 00:32:06,482
- Better than a coward's death.
- Don't call me a coward!

440
00:32:06,566 --> 00:32:08,067
That's enough!

441
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:12,530
I just got a call
from the sheriff's office.

442
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:15,408
Fangs, uh...

443
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:21,039
He didn't make it. He's gone.

444
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:24,125
Fangs is dead?

445
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:28,212
And we will mourn him. We will.
But first, we will honor him.

446
00:32:29,464 --> 00:32:32,091
From what I just heard,
we need to put it to a vote.

447
00:32:33,676 --> 00:32:37,263
All those against going to war
with the Ghoulies?

448
00:32:39,682 --> 00:32:43,269
And all those for giving them hell
on the battlefield tomorrow?

449
00:33:01,878 --> 00:33:04,673
Well, Hal, I can't say I'm surprised.

450
00:33:05,257 --> 00:33:06,174
Mom.

451
00:33:06,258 --> 00:33:08,593
I always knew you were a mama's boy.

452
00:33:08,677 --> 00:33:10,595
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

453
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:17,978
I knew it. I knew you couldn't do anything
for yourself.

454
00:33:18,603 --> 00:33:21,982
- Mom, whatever you're doing, I wouldn't.
- I'm pointing out

455
00:33:22,065 --> 00:33:24,276
that your father can't do anything right.

456
00:33:24,776 --> 00:33:26,862
Not even be a serial killer.

457
00:33:26,945 --> 00:33:30,991
Cleansing the town of sin? Really, Hal?

458
00:33:31,533 --> 00:33:34,035
- You're the damn sinner.
- Mom.

459
00:33:35,579 --> 00:33:40,125
What are you gonna do?
Kill the entire town? Whoever's jaywalked?

460
00:33:40,208 --> 00:33:43,420
What did Fred Andrews do
to deserve to get shot?

461
00:33:43,503 --> 00:33:46,173
- He was an adulterer.
- Then why don't you kill yourself?

462
00:33:46,256 --> 00:33:49,634
You had a fling with Penelope Blossom.
Or me, for that matter.

463
00:33:49,718 --> 00:33:51,636
I stepped out on you with FP,

464
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:57,726
who, in every way that you are not,
is a real man.

465
00:34:16,661 --> 00:34:18,371
This is a mistake.

466
00:34:20,457 --> 00:34:23,001
You can see that, right?

467
00:34:23,084 --> 00:34:27,047
We'd be going in blind, Dad.
Will you listen to me for two seconds?

468
00:34:27,964 --> 00:34:29,132
For all we know,

469
00:34:29,216 --> 00:34:33,595
- the Ghoulies outnumber us 100-to-1.
- Don't you think I know that?

470
00:34:44,522 --> 00:34:48,944
Boy, I've been doing this a lot longer
than you have. And we voted.

471
00:34:49,694 --> 00:34:53,073
If we're going down,
we're going down fighting.

472
00:34:55,951 --> 00:35:01,164
As far as being outnumbered,
I'll rally the reserves. They'll fight.

473
00:35:19,224 --> 00:35:21,559
- This is Hiram.
- Fangs getting arrested,

474
00:35:21,643 --> 00:35:22,477
the riots...

475
00:35:23,478 --> 00:35:26,564
the Ghoulies showing up the night
of the riots, Penny in tow.

476
00:35:28,775 --> 00:35:30,360
None of this is happenstance.

477
00:35:30,443 --> 00:35:33,363
Jughead, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

478
00:35:33,446 --> 00:35:37,534
You've been buying up everything
you could, but you couldn't buy us.

479
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,664
So, you paid the Ghoulies and Penny...

480
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:47,877
to go to war with the Serpents,
to finally get rid of us once and for all.

481
00:35:49,004 --> 00:35:50,714
How much is this costing you?

482
00:35:51,673 --> 00:35:54,301
- I'm hanging up now.
- Because I have a counter-offer.

483
00:35:58,888 --> 00:35:59,848
Mr. Lodge?

484
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:03,727
I'm listening.

485
00:36:15,071 --> 00:36:16,239
Andre?

486
00:36:29,544 --> 00:36:31,087
Veronica? Hermione?

487
00:36:34,049 --> 00:36:36,051
There's another dead body in the study.

488
00:36:37,677 --> 00:36:40,764
It's your mess, Daddy. You clean it up.

489
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,671
It was him, Arch.

490
00:37:14,339 --> 00:37:15,965
My dad was the Black Hood.

491
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:22,597
How did you...?
Did you see him leave my house?

492
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,475
- He tried to shoot my dad again.
- When?

493
00:37:26,142 --> 00:37:27,018
An hour ago.

494
00:37:27,602 --> 00:37:31,272
No, no, no. That's impossible.
He was... He was here with us.

495
00:37:34,526 --> 00:37:36,152
- Jug.
- Betty.

496
00:37:37,237 --> 00:37:39,406
I'm happy to hear your voice.

497
00:37:39,823 --> 00:37:41,950
Me, too, Jug. You have no idea.

498
00:37:42,033 --> 00:37:46,079
I just wanna let you know I love you.
I'll never stop loving you.

499
00:37:46,162 --> 00:37:49,207
- What are you saying? Where are you?
- Where is he?

500
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:50,375
I'll see you soon.

501
00:38:04,806 --> 00:38:07,517
The sacrificial lamb arrives.

502
00:38:09,144 --> 00:38:13,148
I'll remind you of the deal that I made
with your boss, Hiram Lodge.

503
00:38:13,231 --> 00:38:17,152
I hand myself over to you
and there's no bloodshed tomorrow.

504
00:38:17,235 --> 00:38:20,447
Getting you out of the picture
is more important to him

505
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:22,323
than all-out Serpent annihilation.

506
00:38:23,783 --> 00:38:27,036
Thirty-to-1. Are you that afraid of me?

507
00:38:30,206 --> 00:38:34,544
The scary thing is what we're gonna do
to your girlfriend when we find her.

508
00:38:43,428 --> 00:38:45,680
You're a true hero, Jughead.

509
00:38:47,265 --> 00:38:51,186
Let your dying thought be
that your sacrifice was for nothing.

510
00:38:52,854 --> 00:38:57,400
And that come morning, Riverdale
as you know it will cease to exist.

511
00:38:58,985 --> 00:39:01,070
Don't finish him off yet, guys.

512
00:39:02,155 --> 00:39:04,407
I want my pound of flesh first.

513
00:39:10,163 --> 00:39:13,500
- Betty, are you and your mom okay?
- Is Jughead with you?

514
00:39:13,583 --> 00:39:16,044
- He's at the trailer. Why?
- I'm worried about him.

515
00:39:16,127 --> 00:39:18,588
He called to say how much he loves me,

516
00:39:18,671 --> 00:39:21,883
and it sounded like he was saying goodbye
for good.

517
00:39:23,343 --> 00:39:26,137
Toni. Where was Penny hiding out?

518
00:39:36,439 --> 00:39:37,273
Jug?

519
00:39:44,948 --> 00:39:48,910
Minetta delivered the bodies to the
coroner's office, tagged as riot victims.

520
00:39:48,993 --> 00:39:50,912
No one's gonna be asking us questions.

521
00:39:56,668 --> 00:39:57,835
I am so sorry.

522
00:39:59,128 --> 00:40:01,464
I just thank God that neither of you
were hurt.

523
00:40:05,843 --> 00:40:07,929
I found your October Surprise file.

524
00:40:10,974 --> 00:40:14,102
Well, your mother understands
the costs of winning...

525
00:40:15,186 --> 00:40:18,273
better than almost anyone.
Isn't that right, mi amor?

526
00:40:19,315 --> 00:40:20,608
I realized something.

527
00:40:22,026 --> 00:40:25,488
There will always be an October Surprise
with you.

528
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:28,408
And another. And another.

529
00:40:30,743 --> 00:40:33,788
But while Mom may volunteer
to be your collateral damage...

530
00:40:35,415 --> 00:40:37,333
- I won't.
- What did I always teach you?

531
00:40:38,418 --> 00:40:40,378
Never lose sight of the bigger picture.

532
00:40:42,046 --> 00:40:45,133
I'm not the one who's lost sight, Daddy.

533
00:41:01,941 --> 00:41:03,443
Where is he? Where's Jug?

534
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:04,944
Guys...
