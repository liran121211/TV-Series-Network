00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,214
Previously on Riverdale...

2
00:00:01,216 --> 00:00:04,062
- New wheels, Mr. Lodge?
- The car is yours, Archie.

3
00:00:04,065 --> 00:00:07,856
This is what guys like Chuck
think about women. We're objects.

4
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:09,766
Cheryl was obsessed with you

5
00:00:09,768 --> 00:00:12,035
to the point where I was
afraid she might hurt you.

6
00:00:12,037 --> 00:00:13,296
Cheryl threatened me!

7
00:00:13,299 --> 00:00:14,838
Did you know about
Southside High closing?

8
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,406
You acted like you didn't know.

9
00:00:16,408 --> 00:00:17,874
I can't trust you, V.

10
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,958
Chic, I think that you
should leave this house.

11
00:00:22,961 --> 00:00:25,195
I hear I'm back just in time
for <i>Carrie, The Musical?</i>

12
00:00:25,198 --> 00:00:27,617
And this school's gonna burn...

13
00:00:30,355 --> 00:00:32,515
Jughead, thank you for
meeting me before school.

14
00:00:32,518 --> 00:00:34,491
Look, Kev, I know what you're gonna ask.

15
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:36,459
I'm making a behind-the-scenes documentary

17

19
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,934

You know, I got the lumber, I got
the tools, I'm in between gigs.

38
00:01:57,442 --> 00:01:59,338

Welcome to Carrie, The Musical.

64
00:03:20,174 --> 00:03:21,826
Okay, thanks.

65
00:03:22,314 --> 00:03:23,885
Okay. Next, introductions.

66
00:03:24,494 --> 00:03:28,865
I'm Archie, I'm playing
Tommy Ross. The boy next door.

67
00:03:29,768 --> 00:03:33,702
I'm Betty, I play Sue
Snell. The good girl.

68
00:03:33,705 --> 00:03:37,340
Veronica Lodge, playing
mean girl, Chris Hargensen.

69
00:03:38,228 --> 00:03:42,345
I'm Cheryl Blossom, playing
the iconic role of Carrie White.

70
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,216
Tone deaf.

71
00:03:48,486 --> 00:03:50,486
Who's playing your mom? Margaret White.

72
00:03:50,488 --> 00:03:52,455
- I am.
- Ah!

73
00:03:52,457 --> 00:03:54,924
- Mom?
- Wait, seriously?

74
00:03:54,926 --> 00:03:58,428
Settle down. Yes, it's untraditional

75
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:02,127
but to me, there's nothing more
amateur than age-inappropriate casting.

76
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:04,973
I'm really looking forward to
getting to know who this woman is,

77
00:04:04,976 --> 00:04:06,508
you know, get under her skin.

78
00:04:06,511 --> 00:04:09,312
And, of course, to spend some quality
time with my daughter, Elizabeth.

79
00:04:11,343 --> 00:04:12,875
Uh, sorry.

80
00:04:14,145 --> 00:04:16,913
- I thought rehearsals were in the Music Room.
- No problem.

81
00:04:16,915 --> 00:04:19,080
All are welcome here.

82
00:04:19,705 --> 00:04:25,755
So, Chuck Clayton, why did you
say yes to being in the musical?

83
00:04:26,424 --> 00:04:28,681
I'm trying to reform my image.

84
00:04:28,684 --> 00:04:32,779
And, yeah, maybe it's little
counter-intuitive to be playing the villain,

85
00:04:32,782 --> 00:04:35,796
but, I mean, somebody's gotta do it.

86
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:37,858
And I wanna do it right.

87
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:40,837
You know, show up, put in the work,

88
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,923
be a member of the team.

89
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,619
And who knows, maybe...

90
00:04:47,622 --> 00:04:50,478
Maybe then people will start
to change their minds about me.

91
00:04:50,481 --> 00:04:54,296
Kinda weird, huh? The two of
us, playing boyfriend-girlfriend?

92
00:04:54,299 --> 00:04:57,320
Easy there, Arch. Big
Brother's watching.

93
00:04:58,424 --> 00:05:01,524
No, I mean, things are strained
with the four of us right now

94
00:05:01,526 --> 00:05:03,226
but we're here for Kevin,
and to do this play,

95
00:05:03,228 --> 00:05:05,062
and I hope we can do it
as painless as possible.

96
00:05:05,064 --> 00:05:09,766
Archie, Veronica lied to
all of us, you included.

97
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:13,169
Conspiring with her parents
against the entire school?

98
00:05:13,171 --> 00:05:16,906
I mean, and it's fine that you're
doing exactly what Tommy Ross would do,

99
00:05:16,908 --> 00:05:19,976
which is stand by her, but
from where I'm standing?

100
00:05:19,978 --> 00:05:22,093
Veronica's just as much of a privileged,

101
00:05:22,096 --> 00:05:25,681
selfish, spiteful, mean girl
as the part she's playing.

102
00:05:27,485 --> 00:05:29,764
Okay. Act one, scene one.

103
00:05:29,774 --> 00:05:33,897
Actually... Before we begin...

104
00:05:35,686 --> 00:05:39,139
I've heard whisperings that
some of you ensemble-vultures

105
00:05:39,142 --> 00:05:42,165
- don't think I'm fit to play or sing...
- No.

106
00:05:42,167 --> 00:05:43,733

107
00:05:45,036 --> 00:05:47,670
So, to settle this
matter once and for all...

108
00:05:47,672 --> 00:05:49,338

00:07:03,951 --> 00:07:06,560
I have a dark confession to make...

125
00:07:06,563 --> 00:07:10,802
After Cheryl's brush with death
this morning, I found a letter

126
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:14,049
in my locker from
someone alleging to be...

127
00:07:14,052 --> 00:07:16,775
And I can't believe
I'm about to say this...

128
00:07:16,778 --> 00:07:18,888
the Black Hood.

129
00:07:23,451 --> 00:07:25,918
It's a prank. Look at it!

130
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:30,752
Why would the Black Hood,
who was shot dead by my dad,

131
00:07:30,755 --> 00:07:32,991
be demanding that the
role of Carrie be recast?

132
00:07:32,993 --> 00:07:36,428
Yeah, it does seem pretty small
potatoes for the Black Hood.

133
00:07:36,438 --> 00:07:40,741
Yeah. Still. Jug, you can't
tell anyone about this.

What?

165
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:37,104
You want us to take that sexy new
Firebird of yours to Lover's Lane?

166
00:09:41,989 --> 00:09:43,637
Actually, I was gonna
ask if I could keep

167
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,429
it parked at the
Pembrooke for a few days.

168
00:09:45,432 --> 00:09:46,658
Why?

169
00:09:47,668 --> 00:09:50,102
I still haven't told my
dad about the Firebird.

170
00:09:50,105 --> 00:09:52,595
And our dads are literal rivals.

171
00:09:52,598 --> 00:09:55,265
If my dad finds out yours gave
me this big, expensive gift,

172
00:09:55,268 --> 00:09:58,403
- it'll trigger World War Three.
- Fine.

173
00:09:59,073 --> 00:10:00,973
Our garage is your garage.

174
00:10:03,744 --> 00:10:07,212
About the election, do you
really think Fred has a shot?

175
00:10:07,978 --> 00:10:11,282
In our favor, he's essentially
running on a platform

176
00:10:11,285 --> 00:10:14,119
of family values with none
of his family by his side.

177
00:10:14,122 --> 00:10:16,355
I mean, Mary's gone, thank God.

178
00:10:16,357 --> 00:10:21,126
And well, Archie and Fred, they've
never been so distant, have they?

179
00:10:22,696 --> 00:10:24,630
We just need to keep it that way...

180
00:10:28,135 --> 00:10:30,102
No way is this legit.

181
00:10:30,105 --> 00:10:33,522
Well, it's a legit threat, but it's
definitely not from the real Black Hood.

182
00:10:33,525 --> 00:10:36,624
No, this is a classic
Phantom of the Opera tactic.

183
00:10:36,627 --> 00:10:39,111
Mystery Man sends menacing note

184
00:10:39,113 --> 00:10:43,048
demanding a certain diva
soprano gets recast or else.

185
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:46,618
Who's to say this letter came
from a mystery man at all?

186
00:10:46,621 --> 00:10:48,287
That's a good point.

187
00:10:50,424 --> 00:10:52,624
Hey, Ethel, what looks good?

188
00:10:52,627 --> 00:10:54,893
Someone's picked out all
the M&M's from the trail mix.

189
00:10:54,895 --> 00:10:56,830
Ugh, that's terrible.

190
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,530
It's probably Cheryl.

191
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:01,333
I mean, she's always
taking things she shouldn't.

192
00:11:01,335 --> 00:11:04,102
Like the role of Carrie from you...

193
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,471
That's nice of you to say, Betty.

194
00:11:07,471 --> 00:11:11,777
For Kevin to have cast Cheryl as Carrie
without even letting you audition...

195
00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:18,050
Would you say you feel angry?

196
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:21,421
I mean, I was born to play Carrie,

197
00:11:21,424 --> 00:11:25,524
so not to be given a shot at
it, yeah, it makes me angry.

198
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:34,018
Wait, is Jughead filming us?

199
00:11:34,021 --> 00:11:36,021
No. Oh, no, no.

200
00:11:37,237 --> 00:11:39,569
No, he's shooting B-roll.

201
00:11:39,572 --> 00:11:42,307
Look, I have no idea what
you're trying to get me to admit,

202
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:43,976
but I am not a violent person

203
00:11:43,978 --> 00:11:45,744
and for the record, any record,

204
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,877
I would never do anything to threaten

205
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,718
or harm anybody for
my own benefit, ever!

206
00:12:05,736 --> 00:12:07,335
What's happening, handsome?

207
00:12:07,338 --> 00:12:10,171
Just bussin' tables, Alice. You?

208
00:12:10,174 --> 00:12:12,404
Just finished rehearsal.

209
00:12:12,413 --> 00:12:15,314
I'm in the high school
musical. Can you believe it?

210
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,713
Maybe you'll come by?

211
00:12:22,716 --> 00:12:24,115
Check it out.

212
00:12:25,486 --> 00:12:28,387
I'm working, Alice. Sorry.

213
00:12:30,657 --> 00:12:34,593
Wow! Really? This old act again?

214
00:12:36,996 --> 00:12:38,385
You know what's funny?

215
00:12:38,388 --> 00:12:41,268
I was afraid our kids were going
to make the same mistakes we did,

216
00:12:41,271 --> 00:12:44,065
but, it turns out, we're the
ones making them, all over again.

217
00:12:53,013 --> 00:12:55,247
In this scene, gym teacher Mrs. Gardener

218
00:12:55,249 --> 00:12:58,517
is being a friend when our girl
has none, out of sheer kindness.

I noticed the Firebird parked
in the Pembrooke garage.

247
00:14:55,263 --> 00:14:56,776
Is there a problem with it?

248
00:14:56,779 --> 00:15:01,382
No, Daddy. Archie's just parking it here
until he tells Fred you gave it to him.

249
00:15:01,385 --> 00:15:04,176
He's worried he's gonna bruise
his dad's ego or something.

250
00:15:04,178 --> 00:15:06,311
- That makes sense.
- Yup.

Thank you, it helps to be
off-book and in full costume.

00:17:29,335 --> 00:17:31,268

287
00:17:43,807 --> 00:17:45,816
I mean, think about it.

288
00:17:45,819 --> 00:17:48,913

289
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:52,088
Major daddy issues, check.

290
00:17:52,091 --> 00:17:55,315
Bad to the bone, trying to
control everyone around her,

291
00:17:55,318 --> 00:17:59,299

best friend. Check, check, check.

292
00:18:02,901 --> 00:18:05,335
- How could you be so mean to her?
- Archie...

293
00:18:05,338 --> 00:18:08,472
No, Betty, you have no idea what's
really going on with Veronica.

294
00:18:09,694 --> 00:18:13,760
All this intense stuff at home with
her family, the pressure she's under.

295
00:18:13,763 --> 00:18:16,680
She's trying to do her best
under insane circumstances.

296
00:18:16,682 --> 00:18:19,749

297

298
00:18:22,255 --> 00:18:24,400
It's not for me to say, Betty.

299
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,791
You remember how
quickly she forgave you?

300
00:18:26,794 --> 00:18:29,960
When the Black Hood made you
say all those horrible things?

301
00:18:29,963 --> 00:18:34,674

Chris and who should be playing Sue?

325
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:44,093
I just came by to check on the
progress of the show I'm producing,

326
00:20:44,096 --> 00:20:46,129
and lo and behold, Fred Andrews.

327
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,567
Just donating my free time, Hiram.

328
00:20:53,672 --> 00:20:55,683
Has Archie taken you for a spin yet?

329
00:20:55,686 --> 00:20:58,041
- Mr. Lodge...
- In the new Firebird I bought him?

330
00:20:58,043 --> 00:21:01,144
For all the help he's given me and
my family in the past few months.

331
00:21:02,777 --> 00:21:05,315
That's, uh... It's a pretty smooth ride.

332
00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:08,418
Yeah.

333
00:21:10,288 --> 00:21:12,288
A young man never forgets his first car.

334
00:21:27,739 --> 00:21:31,305
- Dad, it's just a car.
- Just a car?

335
00:21:31,308 --> 00:21:33,910
Did I raise you to be that spoiled?

336
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:38,581
Seriously, this doesn't
have to be a big deal, Dad.

337
00:21:38,584 --> 00:21:40,456
It is to me, son.

338
00:21:41,652 --> 00:21:45,513
I was planning on us going to the
junkyard and picking out an old jalopy.

339
00:21:45,516 --> 00:21:49,464
We could've fixed it up, like me and
Grandpa Artie did with my first car.

340
00:21:58,103 --> 00:22:02,094
Honey, I'm sure you're
probably still upset with me,

341
00:22:02,097 --> 00:22:06,042
but I still miss you and
I am worried about you.

342
00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:11,719
I love you, Chic.

343
00:22:11,722 --> 00:22:13,830
Please call me when you can.

344
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:20,223
Mom?

345
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:24,539
It's your brother. He,
uh, won't return my calls.

346
00:22:24,542 --> 00:22:27,539
Not that I blame him for what I did.

347
00:22:27,542 --> 00:22:30,192
I'm gonna get a class of
water. Do you want anything?

348
00:22:31,346 --> 00:22:35,508
Jughead, the sandbag was an accident
and the letter was a prank, right?

349
00:22:35,511 --> 00:22:37,636
- Seems like it.
- That's what I thought.

350
00:22:37,639 --> 00:22:39,769
But then I found this in my locker.

351
00:22:39,772 --> 00:22:41,441
Another letter from the Black Hood.

352
00:22:41,878 --> 00:22:44,881
"This is your last
warning to replace Cheryl.

353
00:22:44,884 --> 00:22:47,589
Next time, the sandbag won't miss."

354
00:22:54,395 --> 00:22:55,979
Cheryl, it's a matter of your safety.

355
00:22:55,982 --> 00:22:58,049
I have to recast the role of Carrie.

356
00:22:58,052 --> 00:23:00,667
I will not succumb to thespian terrorism

357
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,311
and allow myself to be
ousted from this production!

358
00:23:03,314 --> 00:23:06,253
After the fires I've
walked through, Kevin,

359
00:23:06,256 --> 00:23:08,902
the world needs to see
me up on that stage.

360
00:23:08,905 --> 00:23:11,406
A Dark Phoenix reborn
in the spotlight...

361
00:23:11,409 --> 00:23:14,503
Well, they'll have to wait, Cheryl.

362
00:23:15,658 --> 00:23:18,459
- Mother.
- Even in a town as twisted as Riverdale,

363
00:23:18,461 --> 00:23:20,795
students require parental approval

364
00:23:20,797 --> 00:23:24,031
to partake in certain
extracurricular activities.

365
00:23:24,034 --> 00:23:26,866
As I reminded Principal
Weatherbee when I told him

366
00:23:26,869 --> 00:23:31,406
you didn't have my approval to
do the musical and never will.

367
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:34,709
So what? You just feast on
broken dreams now, is that it?

368
00:23:34,711 --> 00:23:39,013
Playing a murderous telekinetic
teen who kills her mother?

369
00:23:39,016 --> 00:23:40,315
Please!

370
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:45,719
This matricidal revenge fantasy...

371
00:23:45,722 --> 00:23:47,054
Never gonna happen.

372
00:23:48,758 --> 00:23:50,324
That's final.

373
00:24:01,904 --> 00:24:05,272
Due to some unforeseen circumstances,

374
00:24:05,275 --> 00:24:07,975
Cheryl will no longer be
playing the role of Carrie White.

375
00:24:07,977 --> 00:24:09,577
- What?
- Why?

376
00:24:11,313 --> 00:24:14,681
Let's just say that Penelope
Blossom isn't much of a stage-mom.

377
00:24:14,684 --> 00:24:16,384
Oh.

378
00:24:17,253 --> 00:24:19,186
I think Cheryl's by the gym bleachers.

379
00:24:22,744 --> 00:24:25,601
In the meantime, Cheryl's
understudy will assume the role.

380
00:24:25,604 --> 00:24:26,894
Understudy?

381
00:24:26,896 --> 00:24:29,263
I appointed one after
the sandbag incident.

382
00:24:32,368 --> 00:24:33,734
Midge Klump!

383
00:24:39,308 --> 00:24:41,390
Screw the musical.

384
00:24:41,393 --> 00:24:44,151
I just wanted to prove to everyone

385
00:24:44,154 --> 00:24:47,995
that I'm still me, but maybe I'm not.

386
00:24:49,285 --> 00:24:54,288
Toni, even Carrie White
could stand up to her mother.

387
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:57,992
Cheryl, you've gotta show
your mother who's in charge.

388
00:24:59,396 --> 00:25:01,914
I don't know if I can anymore.

389
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:05,733
I'm not the same girl who burned
down Thornhill and cut off her oxygen.

390
00:25:05,736 --> 00:25:07,402
Sure, you are.

391
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:10,242
You're not done playing Carrie, Cheryl.

392
00:25:10,245 --> 00:25:12,273

Don't leave me like all the others.

418
00:27:20,836 --> 00:27:22,781
Am I directing a train wreck?

419
00:27:22,784 --> 00:27:24,738
And where's my tea?

420
00:27:30,146 --> 00:27:32,413
Mom?

421
00:27:33,049 --> 00:27:34,648
I'm not going anywhere.

422
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:37,289
Everything... Everything is crumbling.

423
00:27:37,292 --> 00:27:39,720
I've lost everyone.

424
00:27:39,722 --> 00:27:43,424
No, I haven't lost everyone,
I've driven everyone away.

425
00:27:46,978 --> 00:27:52,378
I gave my son away when he was born,

426
00:27:52,381 --> 00:27:55,057
and then, I just did it again.

427
00:27:56,471 --> 00:27:58,605
And your father and I
aren't living together,

428
00:27:58,608 --> 00:28:00,378
because we're still fighting about some

429
00:28:00,381 --> 00:28:03,096
unspoken thing that happened years ago.

430
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:08,415
And... And you and I
have never been so frayed.

431
00:28:21,723 --> 00:28:25,191
My mom's always been a woman
on the verge, but this...

432
00:28:25,935 --> 00:28:28,369
I have to do something
to help her, Jughead.

433
00:28:30,814 --> 00:28:36,318
Something to make her feel
less alone and abandoned.

434
00:28:39,515 --> 00:28:42,437
Guys, the programs are
in, and they look amazing.

435
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,818
Make sure to get them
signed on opening night.

436
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,644
_

437
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,563
Dad, what're you doing here?

438
00:28:56,566 --> 00:28:58,299
Gotta get the sets loaded in.

439
00:28:58,302 --> 00:29:00,507
Yeah, I... I guess I just assumed...

440
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:03,303
What? That I would quit
because we had a disagreement?

441
00:29:03,305 --> 00:29:04,705
That's not the way I roll.

442
00:29:10,203 --> 00:29:12,531
When Kevin came to me
about Carrie, The Musical,

443
00:29:12,534 --> 00:29:15,483
he said I was the literal
embodiment of Tommy Ross.

444
00:29:16,719 --> 00:29:19,553
Loyal, selfless,

445
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:24,031
a hero, a force for good.

446
00:29:25,628 --> 00:29:27,361
But I'm none of those things.

447
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:32,945
I'm not the hero of any story...

448
00:29:32,948 --> 00:29:35,773
Lately, I've been going
down this dark path,

449
00:29:35,776 --> 00:29:37,987
ignoring how much it hurt my dad.

450
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:41,167
Mr. Lodge, there's something
I gotta get off my chest.

451
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:44,064
You may be my boss, but please,

452
00:29:44,067 --> 00:29:46,167
don't try to get between me and my dad.

453
00:29:46,882 --> 00:29:48,716
- Uh...
- Because I promise you, sir,

454
00:29:50,419 --> 00:29:54,621
that is a battle you
will lose, every time.

455
00:30:00,184 --> 00:30:01,950
So, thank you for the Firebird...

456
00:30:05,534 --> 00:30:07,367
But I won't be needing it anymore.

457
00:30:23,592 --> 00:30:27,185
Oh, who are we kidding.
It's opening night!

458
00:30:27,188 --> 00:30:29,029
We're too nervous to eat, anyway.

459
00:30:35,837 --> 00:30:37,170
Alice...

460
00:30:48,583 --> 00:30:49,949
Thank you.

461
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:52,485
You're welcome.

462
00:30:55,424 --> 00:30:58,240
I'm allergic to peonies.
But how would you know that?

463
00:30:58,243 --> 00:31:00,409
We've only been married for decades.

464
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:12,379
I'd really like to
come back home, Alice.

465
00:31:13,708 --> 00:31:15,508
If you'll have me.

466
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,151
If we do this, Hal,

467
00:31:28,154 --> 00:31:30,890
there can't be any
more secrets between us.

468
00:31:34,029 --> 00:31:37,130
- Which means... Betty?
- Yeah?

469
00:31:37,139 --> 00:31:40,006
- Honey, can you give us a moment?
- Yeah.

470
00:31:43,338 --> 00:31:45,881
There's something that
you should know about Chic.

471
00:31:56,170 --> 00:32:00,820
To be honest, I always
suspected that Chic wasn't mine.

472
00:32:03,492 --> 00:32:05,291
I don't care, Alice.

473
00:32:06,728 --> 00:32:08,428
I want to come home.

474
00:32:12,623 --> 00:32:13,922
Alice...

475
00:32:21,042 --> 00:32:23,974
Our secrets can't hurt us anymore.

476
00:32:29,068 --> 00:32:31,050
But we can be together again.

477
00:32:47,439 --> 00:32:49,539
Don't you have a show to get ready for?

478
00:32:49,542 --> 00:32:51,843
Yeah, I do, but this couldn't wait.

479
00:32:53,642 --> 00:32:55,508
I gave back the Firebird, Dad.

480
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,176
And I sold some of my music stuff so

481
00:32:57,179 --> 00:32:58,980
I could buy this off of Junkyard Steve.

482
00:33:16,231 --> 00:33:20,200
It needs a lot of work, Dad,
but I'm up for it if you are.

483
00:33:27,376 --> 00:33:29,176
You better get going, Arch.

484
00:33:30,378 --> 00:33:32,212

Claudius, is that you?

522
00:35:49,309 --> 00:35:51,742
Do you know whose blood this is, Mummy?

523
00:35:53,241 --> 00:35:56,992
This is Jason's blood...
This is Daddy's blood...

524
00:35:56,995 --> 00:36:02,355
And the next blood to
be spilt will be yours.

525
00:36:02,358 --> 00:36:05,031
Cheryl, dear God!

526
00:36:05,034 --> 00:36:07,867
You've been in cahoots
with Daddy's twin,

527
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:10,979
you tried to kill Nana Rose,

528
00:36:10,982 --> 00:36:14,354
and then you shipped me
off to a ghoulish nunnery.

529
00:36:14,357 --> 00:36:16,588
But your depraved gambits are finished.

530
00:36:18,279 --> 00:36:24,346
If you so much as pluck one hair
from Nana Rose's little head,

531
00:36:26,182 --> 00:36:27,782
I'll end you.

532
00:36:31,693 --> 00:36:35,194
I burned one house down,
I'll happily burn another...

533
00:36:35,197 --> 00:36:38,231
Nightmare child, what
do you want from me?

534
00:36:38,233 --> 00:36:40,414
I want to be emancipated.

535
00:36:40,417 --> 00:36:44,003
I want Thistlehouse all to my self

536
00:36:44,005 --> 00:36:45,338
and my Nana...

537
00:36:47,542 --> 00:36:49,275
Start packing, Mummy.

538
00:36:50,945 --> 00:36:53,588
You and Uncle Claudius are pig-people.

539
00:36:53,591 --> 00:36:56,862
And should live amongst the pigs.

540
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,668
Thank you. Hello. Good to see you.

541
00:37:09,671 --> 00:37:12,964
Thank you. Gillian, how are you?

542
00:37:18,674 --> 00:37:20,273
Hal, come here!

543
00:37:24,555 --> 00:37:26,021
Did you bring it?

544
00:37:39,236 --> 00:37:41,441
Ten minutes to places! Where is Fangs?

545
00:37:41,444 --> 00:37:42,643
I don't know.

546
00:37:46,776 --> 00:37:51,145
- Fangs!
- I was giving Midge some last minute notes.

547
00:37:51,148 --> 00:37:53,448
Well, hurry up, because
it's ten minutes to places!

548
00:38:03,256 --> 00:38:04,589
Hey, Ethel?

549
00:38:07,647 --> 00:38:09,988
I'm doing final interviews.

550
00:38:09,991 --> 00:38:11,290
Ethel!

551
00:38:32,022 --> 00:38:33,288
What...

552
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:43,678
QED, folks, it was Ethel.

553
00:38:43,681 --> 00:38:45,378
What was?

554
00:38:45,381 --> 00:38:48,761
Uh, just some magazines.

555
00:38:48,764 --> 00:38:51,138
Okay, I know what you're
thinking but you're wrong.

556
00:38:51,141 --> 00:38:52,446
Those were for my vision board.

557
00:38:52,449 --> 00:38:54,943
It's okay. You can tell me.

558
00:38:54,946 --> 00:38:57,286
Get out of my dressing room, Jughead.

559
00:38:59,808 --> 00:39:01,850
Sounds like a guilty conscious to me.

560
00:39:01,852 --> 00:39:04,653
- Hey, Moose.
- Get out of my way, Jones!

561
00:39:06,253 --> 00:39:09,774
What a to-do to die today
at a minute or two till two.

562
00:39:09,777 --> 00:39:13,585
A thing distinctly hard to
say, but harder still to do.

563
00:39:19,033 --> 00:39:20,399
Chuck?

564
00:39:21,019 --> 00:39:25,340
Let me speak for the whole gang
when I say that your behavior

565
00:39:25,342 --> 00:39:27,609
throughout rehearsals
has been nothing short

566
00:39:27,611 --> 00:39:30,931
of that of a proper Victorian gentleman.

567
00:39:30,934 --> 00:39:33,901
Um, what does that mean?

568
00:39:35,327 --> 00:39:38,495
Your pariahship is officially over.

569
00:39:41,058 --> 00:39:42,391
Hey, Betty.

570
00:39:45,362 --> 00:39:46,595
Chic...

571
00:39:48,866 --> 00:39:50,098
You made it.

572
00:39:50,101 --> 00:39:52,040
Of course, I wouldn't
miss this for the world.

573
00:39:52,043 --> 00:39:54,076
Five minutes to places, people.

574
00:39:56,674 --> 00:39:59,107
You should get back to your seat, Chic.

575
00:39:59,109 --> 00:40:01,510
You're not really
allowed to be backstage.

576
00:40:02,446 --> 00:40:03,712
No problem.

577
00:40:06,617 --> 00:40:08,083

All right, Carrietta, it's
time to come out of your closet.

587
00:41:13,183 --> 00:41:16,243
Uh, Kevin, did you re-block this scene?

588
00:41:16,246 --> 00:41:18,157
Why isn't she on her knees singing?

589
00:41:20,891 --> 00:41:24,446
_

590
00:41:27,464 --> 00:41:30,290
- I don't think that's part of the show.
- Oh, my God!

591
00:41:30,293 --> 00:41:32,968
Somebody, should help her.
For God's sake, help her!

592
00:41:42,046 --> 00:41:43,311
Betty!
