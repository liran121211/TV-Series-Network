00:00:00,056 --> 00:00:01,263
<i>Previously on</i> Riverdale

2
00:00:01,264 --> 00:00:03,563
We will not rest
until those responsible

3
00:00:03,564 --> 00:00:06,603
<i>For the murder of our sister
is rightly punished.</i>

4
00:00:06,604 --> 00:00:07,634
Fangs...

5
00:00:08,348 --> 00:00:10,817
Mrs. Klump, the Sheriff's department
is working around the clock...

6
00:00:10,818 --> 00:00:13,718
you were supposed to be
protecting our children.

7
00:00:14,774 --> 00:00:16,143
What's all this?
It's ransom money.

8
00:00:16,144 --> 00:00:18,043
Not for Archie, I got him back.

9
00:00:18,044 --> 00:00:21,683
This is from when I turned the tables on
Nick, and held him for ransom instead.

10
00:00:21,684 --> 00:00:23,583
I still haven't made my bones with you.

11
00:00:23,584 --> 00:00:26,723
There's only one man I'm interested
in bringing down, the Black Hood.

12
00:00:26,724 --> 00:00:29,724
And whatever I can do to help you
on your quest, you can count on me.

13
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,793
<i>This is the Black Hood speaking.</i>

14
00:00:32,794 --> 00:00:35,724
<i>I got a letter. These symbols
look so familiar to me.</i>

15
00:00:35,894 --> 00:00:38,263
I used to check out
this book obsessively.

16
00:00:38,264 --> 00:00:39,963
Betty, how could
the Black Hood know that?

17
00:00:39,964 --> 00:00:41,304
Put it on.

18
00:00:41,534 --> 00:00:43,803
<i>Why are you doing this to me?</i>

19
00:00:43,804 --> 00:00:45,103
<i>To show you that we're the same.</i>

20
00:00:45,104 --> 00:00:48,004
Where is he, Betty?
Where did you take Chic?

21
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:49,713
Did you kill my brother?

22
00:00:49,714 --> 00:00:50,814
I didn't mean to hurt him.

23
00:00:51,884 --> 00:00:53,214
I'm gonna give you a head start.

24
00:00:57,184 --> 00:00:58,684
Mom, where's dad?

25
00:01:07,024 --> 00:01:08,563
Hello.
Hello, Sir.

26
00:01:08,564 --> 00:01:10,393
I'm campaigning for my dad, Fred Andrews.

27
00:01:10,394 --> 00:01:12,594
He's running for mayor of Riverdale
and could really use your vote.

28
00:01:12,604 --> 00:01:14,403
<i>On the Eve of
the mayoral debate,</i>

29
00:01:14,404 --> 00:01:16,634
<i>As Archie Andrews
goes door-to-door,</i>

30
00:01:18,674 --> 00:01:22,374
<i>He doesn't mention the murder
of his classmate, Midge Klump.</i>

31
00:01:22,544 --> 00:01:24,274
Excuse me, Sir.

32
00:01:24,275 --> 00:01:25,943
I'm campaigning for my dad, Fred Andrews.

33
00:01:25,944 --> 00:01:27,513
I'm voting for Hiram Lodge.

34
00:01:27,514 --> 00:01:28,944
Don't you mean Hermione lodge?

35
00:01:30,654 --> 00:01:32,914
Take the flyer, Sir,
in case you change your mind.

36
00:01:32,924 --> 00:01:34,354
Sure.

37
00:01:34,355 --> 00:01:36,854
<i>Most people believed Midge
was murdered by someone else</i>

38
00:01:38,194 --> 00:01:39,593
<i>But not Archie.</i>

39
00:01:39,594 --> 00:01:41,993
<i>He was certain,
beyond a shadow of a doubt,</i>

40
00:01:41,994 --> 00:01:43,394
<i>The Black Hood was back,</i>

41
00:01:43,734 --> 00:01:46,463
<i>As was his next-door neighbor,
Betty Cooper.</i>

42
00:01:46,464 --> 00:01:49,464
<i>Who had, in fact,
laid eyes on the Black Hood</i>

43
00:01:49,634 --> 00:01:52,234
<i>And suspected he was much closer.</i>

44
00:01:53,304 --> 00:01:55,004
Penny for your thoughts, hon?

45
00:01:56,674 --> 00:02:00,484
I was thinking that he was a test.

46
00:02:02,014 --> 00:02:03,253
Who was?

47
00:02:03,254 --> 00:02:05,214
The impostor, Chic.

48
00:02:05,224 --> 00:02:08,784
Everything that he did to us
and brought to us,

49
00:02:08,794 --> 00:02:11,354
Was kind of a test.

50
00:02:11,624 --> 00:02:14,323
But we survived
and we're stronger for it.

51
00:02:14,324 --> 00:02:16,193
Well, that remains to be seen.

52
00:02:16,194 --> 00:02:18,334
No, mom, we are.

53
00:02:18,534 --> 00:02:20,834
And we'll survive
whatever else comes next.

54
00:02:26,244 --> 00:02:27,943
<i>You can't see
my bruises anymore.</i>

55
00:02:27,944 --> 00:02:30,343
Yes, no reason
whatsoever to bring up

56
00:02:30,344 --> 00:02:32,974
Nick's failed attempt to kidnap
and murder you.

57
00:02:33,454 --> 00:02:36,983
Speaking of, there is one
thing I wanted to tell you.

58
00:02:36,984 --> 00:02:38,253
What's that?

59
00:02:38,254 --> 00:02:41,053
Word of my exploits serving
Nick his comeuppance

60
00:02:41,054 --> 00:02:44,493
Has seeped into the demimonde
of mobsters and molls

61
00:02:44,494 --> 00:02:46,464
My father used to associate with,

62
00:02:46,994 --> 00:02:50,093
So the five families are sending
their youngest and brightest

63
00:02:50,094 --> 00:02:51,894
Their "princes," as it were

64
00:02:51,904 --> 00:02:55,433
to, well, come court
the rare mafia princess

65
00:02:55,434 --> 00:02:57,503
Who can belly up to the bar
with the big boys.

66
00:02:57,504 --> 00:02:59,103
What do you mean, "court"?

67
00:02:59,104 --> 00:03:02,343
Thanks to my play, the families
are looking to make a business

68
00:03:02,344 --> 00:03:05,013
And/or political alliances
with my parents.

69
00:03:05,014 --> 00:03:07,143
It's all very <i>Borgia-Medici.</i>

70
00:03:07,144 --> 00:03:09,583
Archie, if you have a moment?

71
00:03:09,584 --> 00:03:11,383
Go ahead.
We'll meet up at lunch,

72
00:03:11,384 --> 00:03:13,524
After I welcome the tributes.

73
00:03:15,424 --> 00:03:18,593
My spies tell me you're out
campaigning for your father.

74
00:03:18,594 --> 00:03:20,924
I'm not campaigning, Mr. Lodge.

75
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,664
I'm trying to find
the Black Hood.

76
00:03:22,694 --> 00:03:26,094
It sounds insane,
but I remember his eyes.

77
00:03:26,204 --> 00:03:28,504
So I'm going house-to-house to...

78
00:03:28,534 --> 00:03:31,034
Stare into men's eyes?

79
00:03:31,474 --> 00:03:34,043
Well, that sounds like
looking for a needle in a haystack,

80
00:03:34,044 --> 00:03:36,743
But we don't even know if that
the needle is in the haystack.

81
00:03:36,744 --> 00:03:39,244
You said you wanted to make your bones.
Is that still true?

82
00:03:41,614 --> 00:03:43,484
Yes.
Well, then...

83
00:03:46,054 --> 00:03:47,653
Why don't you reform
your Dark Circle?

84
00:03:47,654 --> 00:03:49,993
You'll want back-up should
you identify the Black Hood.

85
00:03:49,994 --> 00:03:53,023
Reggie and the guys are
fired-up, Mr. Lodge, for sure,

86
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:56,794
But I need focused lasers,
not loose cannons.

87
00:03:57,464 --> 00:03:58,894
To help with that...

88
00:03:58,904 --> 00:04:01,264
A new Sheriff's taken over
for Keller, Michael Minetta.

89
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:04,573
A man I know very well. You could
coordinate your efforts with him.

90
00:04:04,574 --> 00:04:05,873
Really?
Yes.

91
00:04:05,874 --> 00:04:08,874
I'll arrange a meeting.
But move fast, Archie.

92
00:04:09,644 --> 00:04:12,474
Every hour that passes, our killer
could be planning his next attack.

93
00:04:15,454 --> 00:04:16,914
Any word from Chic?

94
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:21,353
No. He hasn't called since
I took him to the bus station.

95
00:04:21,354 --> 00:04:24,094
So who knows?
Maybe he's gone for good.

96
00:04:27,264 --> 00:04:30,864
Hey, the silver lining to all this Chic
stuff over the last couple of weeks is...

97
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,433
That's as bad as it gets, Betty.

98
00:04:33,434 --> 00:04:35,134
It can't get worse, how could it?

99
00:04:36,004 --> 00:04:37,934
My dad could be the Black Hood.

100
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:41,974
Yeah, okay.
Well, that would be worse.

101
00:04:46,914 --> 00:04:48,384
Well, well, well...

102
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:52,654
Aren't you boys a handsome
assortment of he-devils?

103
00:04:53,224 --> 00:04:56,084
Veronica, these young men have
come to pay their respects.

104
00:04:56,094 --> 00:04:57,853
Oh, I know why they're here, mom.

105
00:04:57,854 --> 00:05:00,893
And while I'm dying to hear proposals,
I'm already late for school.

106
00:05:00,894 --> 00:05:02,624
But maybe I can squeeze you in tomorrow?

107
00:05:03,494 --> 00:05:05,494
Uh... Tomorrow?

108
00:05:05,734 --> 00:05:08,164
You do things your way,
mom, I do things mine.

109
00:05:11,104 --> 00:05:12,873
<i>There's no one else
that I can talk to.</i>

110
00:05:12,874 --> 00:05:15,604
No one else who might understand
what I'm going through.

111
00:05:16,674 --> 00:05:18,874
Dear cousin, you look harrowed.
What is it?

112
00:05:19,114 --> 00:05:21,844
Cheryl, before you saw
the video of your dad...

113
00:05:22,884 --> 00:05:24,753
Shooting Jason...

114
00:05:24,754 --> 00:05:27,084
Did you know that
he was the murderer?

115
00:05:28,154 --> 00:05:30,554
Subconsciously, yes.
Why do you ask?

116
00:05:32,594 --> 00:05:35,424
I think there's a chance that my dad...

117
00:05:36,664 --> 00:05:38,164
That somehow...

118
00:05:41,204 --> 00:05:43,104
He might be the Black Hood.

119
00:05:45,004 --> 00:05:49,004
Oh. Oh, Betty, I don't know.

120
00:05:49,314 --> 00:05:52,243
I've seen your pater
sneak around Thistlehouse,

121
00:05:52,244 --> 00:05:54,584
And he has all the stealth
of a marshmallow man.

122
00:05:55,584 --> 00:05:56,653
Wherefore comes this accusation?

123
00:05:56,654 --> 00:05:58,114
It's just intuition.

124
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,353
Cheryl, I don't want my dad
to be a murderer.

125
00:06:00,354 --> 00:06:02,623
It would destroy our lives even more,

126
00:06:02,624 --> 00:06:05,093
But I don't know...

127
00:06:05,094 --> 00:06:07,494
I can feel it in my bones...

128
00:06:09,564 --> 00:06:12,064
If you're coming to me for advice, fine.

129
00:06:12,064 --> 00:06:13,203
Let's get you to the Po-Po.

130
00:06:13,204 --> 00:06:15,134
Maybe this new Sheriff
has half a brain...

131
00:06:15,135 --> 00:06:17,134
No. No. Not Yet.

132
00:06:17,504 --> 00:06:20,174
I need to be sure before
I involve anyone else.

133
00:06:20,274 --> 00:06:22,274
Also, I know
it's hard to explain,

134
00:06:22,275 --> 00:06:23,743
But if my dad is the Black Hood,

135
00:06:23,744 --> 00:06:27,414
I need to be the one who
confronts him, who stops him.

136
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:32,184
In that case,
absorb my hard-learned advice.

137
00:06:32,384 --> 00:06:35,053
You need concrete proof,
or a confession, or both.

138
00:06:35,054 --> 00:06:37,453
First step? Buy yourself time
while you investigate.

139
00:06:37,454 --> 00:06:39,323
That means pretending
everything is normal.

140
00:06:39,324 --> 00:06:41,194
Yeah, well, luckily,
that's my specialty.

141
00:06:42,664 --> 00:06:45,094
You're playing a very
dangerous game, Betty Cooper.

142
00:06:47,734 --> 00:06:51,574
I don't think he would hurt
his own daughter.

143
00:06:53,744 --> 00:06:56,244
And I never thought my dad would
shoot his son in the forehead,

144
00:06:57,344 --> 00:06:58,374
But that's the world we live in.

145
00:07:00,184 --> 00:07:01,584
Tread carefully, cousin.

146
00:07:09,354 --> 00:07:11,023
You and Fred are neck-and-neck,

147
00:07:11,024 --> 00:07:13,763
And with the town divided over
our prison, this debate is...

148
00:07:13,764 --> 00:07:16,393
Is the single most important
event of the election.

149
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,663
I know.
I know, basta.

150
00:07:18,664 --> 00:07:20,903
We already control the Sheriff's
office, and the register,

151
00:07:20,904 --> 00:07:24,203
But we need the mayor's office as
well, so the prison can't be blocked.

152
00:07:24,204 --> 00:07:26,373
I'm hoping Archie's Dark Circle
will cause unrest.

153
00:07:26,374 --> 00:07:28,604
After all, if Fred can't control
his own son,

154
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:32,314
He certainly can't control a town
on the verge of sliding into chaos.

155
00:07:34,614 --> 00:07:37,013
<i>If what happened to Midge
taught us anything,</i>

156
00:07:37,014 --> 00:07:38,983
It's that no one is safe, anywhere.

157
00:07:38,984 --> 00:07:41,823
This town needs us,
it needs the Dark Circle.

158
00:07:41,824 --> 00:07:43,454
And this time, we'll have
the new Sheriff's support.

159
00:07:44,354 --> 00:07:46,023
No offense, Kev.
None taken.

160
00:07:46,024 --> 00:07:47,793
Here to catch the guy
who cost my dad his job.

161
00:07:47,794 --> 00:07:49,624
Guys, I...
I gotta tell you something.

162
00:07:50,564 --> 00:07:54,064
The night of the show, Midge and I got
into a fight backstage cause she admitted,

163
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:56,464
She was seeing someone else,
behind my back.

164
00:07:56,474 --> 00:07:57,674
Who?
Who?

165
00:07:58,774 --> 00:07:59,834
She let it slip that
it was a Serpent.

166
00:07:59,844 --> 00:08:00,944
What?

167
00:08:03,074 --> 00:08:06,913
I knew it, I knew it, the second
they set foot in this school!

168
00:08:06,914 --> 00:08:10,314
Moose, why didn't you say anything to us?
Or my dad?

169
00:08:11,354 --> 00:08:12,914
I didn't want to look like the jealous
boyfriend and have people think that I...

170
00:08:15,024 --> 00:08:17,023
We should talk to the new Sheriff...
screw that!

171
00:08:17,024 --> 00:08:19,323
Some Serpent scumbag was doing Midge.

172
00:08:19,324 --> 00:08:20,964
We just gotta figure out which one.

173
00:08:21,694 --> 00:08:24,733
<i>War baby called my father
and I from Shankshaw.</i>

174
00:08:24,734 --> 00:08:27,603
Her old adversaries,
the Ghoulies, had been released.

175
00:08:27,604 --> 00:08:29,903
Word on the street is that
they want Serpent blood.

176
00:08:29,904 --> 00:08:32,304
They're gunning for a re-match.
They want war.

177
00:08:33,504 --> 00:08:35,504
Which one of you reptiles
was screwing Midge Klump?

178
00:08:35,514 --> 00:08:37,643
What the hell is going on?
This is a private meeting.

179
00:08:37,644 --> 00:08:39,944
I'm guessing it was you, Sweet Pea.

180
00:08:40,884 --> 00:08:42,144
Reggie, that's enough.

181
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:44,213
You ass, I didn't even know Midge.

182
00:08:44,214 --> 00:08:47,154
But yeah, I get why she wouldn't
want fleas from you mangy bulldogs!

183
00:08:48,154 --> 00:08:49,284
Reggie, no!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

184
00:08:49,294 --> 00:08:51,094
Stop fighting now!

185
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,000

186
00:09:05,304 --> 00:09:06,704
So I've been thinking.

187
00:09:06,944 --> 00:09:10,843
Dad, you've been so busy
at the register lately.

188
00:09:10,844 --> 00:09:12,474
Maybe mom should go back to work.

189
00:09:13,184 --> 00:09:16,144
I mean, she's moderating the debate,
why not report on it, as well?

190
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:20,283
I suppose it's not a terrible idea.

191
00:09:20,284 --> 00:09:23,593
Yeah, and I could help, too, after
school with proofing and layout.

192
00:09:23,594 --> 00:09:25,994
My two best girls back at the register?

193
00:09:28,724 --> 00:09:31,594
It's bad, Jones.
It's really bad.

194
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:32,994
So talk to me, Fangs.

195
00:09:33,004 --> 00:09:35,203
On the opening night of <i>Carrie,</i>
when you were backstage

196
00:09:35,204 --> 00:09:38,373
Filming your documentary and you
found me in Midge's dressing room...

197
00:09:38,374 --> 00:09:41,104
I wasn't just giving her notes...

198
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:43,644
You were hooking up.

199
00:09:44,774 --> 00:09:46,144
And you didn't tell Sheriff Keller?

200
00:09:48,114 --> 00:09:49,714
Jeez, Fangs, do you know how
guilty this makes you look?

201
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:52,084
I know! I know.

202
00:09:54,954 --> 00:09:56,524
Did you do it?

203
00:09:57,094 --> 00:09:58,524
Of course not.

204
00:09:58,994 --> 00:10:01,393
You've got to believe me, Jones!
I do!

205
00:10:01,394 --> 00:10:03,424
Can you delete the footage
off your camera?

206
00:10:03,434 --> 00:10:05,633
I already gave the footage over
to Sheriff Keller as evidence.

207
00:10:05,634 --> 00:10:07,864
What do I do, Jones?
Nothing.

208
00:10:08,804 --> 00:10:10,874
Lay low.
Serpents got your back.

209
00:10:11,604 --> 00:10:12,874
I got your back.

210
00:10:21,284 --> 00:10:22,013
Okay.

211
00:10:22,014 --> 00:10:25,853
Canned meat isn't exactly sexy,
but it's making a comeback.

212
00:10:25,854 --> 00:10:27,853
Tell your folks
we should open a cannery

213
00:10:27,854 --> 00:10:29,723
In that maple syrup factory
I saw on the river.

214
00:10:29,724 --> 00:10:31,854
I only like my meat
free-range and grass-fed.

215
00:10:32,394 --> 00:10:35,163
My family runs a five thousand-seat
arena in pacific city.

216
00:10:35,164 --> 00:10:37,633
They're looking to do the same here.
Do you have a favorite boxer?

217
00:10:37,634 --> 00:10:39,664
Michelle Rodriguez <i>girlfight.</i>

218
00:10:40,864 --> 00:10:41,764
My family owns a track.

219
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:46,134
If you get your old man to invest with
my old man, I'll name a horse after you.

220
00:10:46,144 --> 00:10:48,904
I want ships named after me, not horses.

221
00:10:50,974 --> 00:10:54,243
We own and operate the largest chain
of casinos in the region, Ms. Lodge.

222
00:10:54,244 --> 00:10:54,883
And we're looking to expand.

223
00:10:54,884 --> 00:10:58,783
I'm not opposed to games of luck, <i>Elio</i>.
But are your dice loaded?

224
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:00,584
No. No need to be crooked.

225
00:11:00,854 --> 00:11:03,684
Or haven't you heard?
The house always wins.

226
00:11:04,694 --> 00:11:06,494
Tell me more, <i>Elio</i>.

227
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,924
And it's Veronica, not "Ms. Lodge."

228
00:11:22,204 --> 00:11:24,674
this is some pretty
forceful branding, Archie.

229
00:11:24,675 --> 00:11:25,843
Reggie made those, not me.

230
00:11:25,844 --> 00:11:28,743
I need your Dark Circle
to just lay off my Serpents.

231
00:11:28,744 --> 00:11:31,713
Even though they were technically
right about something.

232
00:11:31,714 --> 00:11:33,014
What do you mean?

233
00:11:33,224 --> 00:11:35,823
One of my Serpents was
canoodling with Midge.

234
00:11:35,824 --> 00:11:36,304
But he didn't kill her.

235
00:11:36,305 --> 00:11:39,093
And I'm not gonna give you his
name so please don't ask.

236
00:11:39,094 --> 00:11:42,763
But rest assured, none of my crew is a
middle-aged white guy with green eyes.

237
00:11:42,764 --> 00:11:44,694
And that's who you're still
looking for, right? Yeah.

238
00:11:46,704 --> 00:11:48,564
I'll tell Reggie to lay off.
Thank you.

239
00:11:50,234 --> 00:11:51,933
In the meantime,
I need to get back some possibly

240
00:11:51,934 --> 00:11:53,803
Incriminating footage
from this new Sheriff.

241
00:11:53,804 --> 00:11:55,443
Have you met him yet?

242
00:11:55,444 --> 00:11:57,414
No. But do you mind if I tag along?

243
00:12:00,184 --> 00:12:01,384
Gentlemen...

244
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:05,553
This is the young man I was
telling you about, Archie Andrews.

245
00:12:05,554 --> 00:12:07,353
The one organizing the safety initiative.

246
00:12:07,354 --> 00:12:10,054
The Dark Circle.
A man after my own heart.

247
00:12:10,694 --> 00:12:13,154
And this is the other one...

248
00:12:14,324 --> 00:12:16,064
The muckraker.

249
00:12:16,065 --> 00:12:18,134
The trouble maker.

250
00:12:18,834 --> 00:12:20,364
You forgot iconoclast.

251
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:21,933
I was wondering if I could
have a word about

252
00:12:21,934 --> 00:12:25,704
Some documentary footage
that I lent your predecessor?

253
00:12:26,604 --> 00:12:28,804
Sure. Let's chat in my office.

254
00:12:33,714 --> 00:12:36,284
Hmm. Archie, Archie,
Archie, Archie...

255
00:12:38,584 --> 00:12:42,123
You said you wanted to introduce
me to Sheriff Minetta, Mr. Lodge,

256
00:12:42,124 --> 00:12:44,154
So I took it upon myself to stop by.

257
00:12:45,324 --> 00:12:47,694
Well, since you have
so much free time,

258
00:12:47,994 --> 00:12:50,293
Veronica may have mentioned
that she's entertaining

259
00:12:50,294 --> 00:12:52,594
A young man from
a prominent family tonight.

260
00:12:52,604 --> 00:12:54,564
I'm hoping that
you'll accompany them?

261
00:12:54,864 --> 00:12:56,564
Absolutely, Mr. Lodge.

262
00:13:02,344 --> 00:13:06,713
Out of all the offers on the table,
<i>Elio</i>, yours inspired me the most.

263
00:13:06,714 --> 00:13:11,453
So what if our families were to partner
up for say, "The Sweetwater Casino"?

264
00:13:11,454 --> 00:13:13,454
Nothing would make
my father happier.

265
00:13:14,054 --> 00:13:15,254
Perfection.

266
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:22,894
Now, play nice, boys,
while I go powder my nose.

267
00:13:31,674 --> 00:13:33,674
How'd you get in with the Lodges?

268
00:13:36,174 --> 00:13:38,543
I'm mostly just with Veronica.

269
00:13:38,544 --> 00:13:40,343
My dad says
you're one of Hiram's capos,

270
00:13:40,344 --> 00:13:42,744
That you made your bones
taking care of Papa Poutine?

271
00:13:42,754 --> 00:13:45,183
No, that wasn't me.

272
00:13:45,184 --> 00:13:48,323
Word is, Papa Poutine's son,
Small Fry is looking for payback.

273
00:13:48,324 --> 00:13:50,354
No one in Riverdale
had anything to do with that.

274
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,534
You sure you don't want to take
a break and join us for dinner, honey?

275
00:14:00,234 --> 00:14:02,833
I'm not hungry right now. Will you get
me a tomato bisque for later though?

276
00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:06,534
Okay. And maybe, an orange freeze?

277
00:14:07,174 --> 00:14:08,474
Sounds great, dad.

278
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:37,803
I got into my dad's planner.
And cross-referenced the dates

279
00:14:37,804 --> 00:14:41,443
Of every Black Hood attack with
his schedule, and they all line up.

280
00:14:41,444 --> 00:14:44,814
Okay. "Worked late" the night
Midge and moose were attacked.

281
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:47,313
"Early meeting"
the morning Fred was shot.

282
00:14:47,314 --> 00:14:49,783
"Business trip" the night
Ms. Grundy was killed.

283
00:14:49,784 --> 00:14:51,814
Business trip to Greendale, no doubt.

284
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,924
This isn't proof,
but this is corroboration.

285
00:15:01,364 --> 00:15:02,424
Register.

286
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:05,634
<i>Mrs. Cooper, this is Dr. Curdle
from the coroner's office.</i>

287
00:15:06,104 --> 00:15:07,464
How...

288
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:10,464
How can I help you?

289
00:15:10,474 --> 00:15:12,503
<i>I have a warm body for you.</i>

290
00:15:12,504 --> 00:15:14,843
<i>Unidentified male, mid-20s.</i>

291
00:15:14,844 --> 00:15:18,714
<i>His body turned up off the highway,
just outside town, mutilated.</i>

292
00:15:21,514 --> 00:15:23,714
<i>Mrs. Cooper.
Are you there?</i>

293
00:15:24,154 --> 00:15:25,254
Yes.

294
00:15:26,054 --> 00:15:28,884
Yes, I'll come... I'll come by to see it.
Thank you, Dr. Curdle.

295
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:31,894
<i>As always, small bills are preferable.</i>

296
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:38,064
We have to go to the morgue.
Why?

297
00:15:38,834 --> 00:15:40,163
Another Black Hood victim?

298
00:15:40,164 --> 00:15:42,164
I sent the Black Hood after Chic.

299
00:15:42,834 --> 00:15:47,144
I gave Chic a head start and told him
to run, but maybe he didn't make it.

300
00:15:54,144 --> 00:15:56,244
Sheriff Minetta wouldn't
give me back my footage.

301
00:15:56,254 --> 00:15:58,783
Says he wants to go
through it frame by frame.

302
00:15:58,784 --> 00:16:02,053
It's only a matter of time before he puts
two and two together and brings Fangs in.

303
00:16:02,054 --> 00:16:05,354
Damn it.
Of all the girls in Riverdale high...

304
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,663
what do I do?

305
00:16:07,664 --> 00:16:10,793
If Fangs runs, he looks guilty.

306
00:16:10,794 --> 00:16:13,464
If he's caught withholding the truth,
he'll look like the killer.

307
00:16:16,734 --> 00:16:18,273
It's a perfect storm.

308
00:16:18,274 --> 00:16:20,303
The Lodges endorsed
this new Sheriff.

309
00:16:20,304 --> 00:16:21,673
They want Midge's killer caught

310
00:16:21,674 --> 00:16:23,504
And if it's a southsider,
so much the better.

311
00:16:23,514 --> 00:16:25,144
Then we hunker down...

312
00:16:27,714 --> 00:16:29,084
get ready to fight.

313
00:16:39,824 --> 00:16:41,194
Dad?

314
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:47,194
What are you still doing up?

315
00:16:47,964 --> 00:16:49,604
I got this note.

316
00:16:50,304 --> 00:16:51,874
Pinned to the front door.

317
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:54,844
I can only assume it's from
our old pal, the Black Hood.

318
00:17:00,744 --> 00:17:03,343
It's clear what has to be done.
We cancel the debate.

319
00:17:03,344 --> 00:17:05,243
Prank or not,
it's not a risk we can take.

320
00:17:05,244 --> 00:17:07,843
I agree. Until the Black Hood's
caught, we have to be careful.

321
00:17:07,844 --> 00:17:10,455
Can you beef up security
at the town hall?

322
00:17:10,456 --> 00:17:12,385
Fred, honestly...
dad, you can't be serious.

323
00:17:12,386 --> 00:17:14,225
We'll lock town hall down
tighter than a steel drum.

324
00:17:14,354 --> 00:17:16,624
The town is scared. They need
to be shown we can't be cowed.

325
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:20,766
Well, if Fred's in, so are we.

326
00:17:25,746 --> 00:17:28,006
You're not the Mrs. Cooper
I was expecting.

327
00:17:28,016 --> 00:17:30,316
Yeah, well.
My money's good just the same.

328
00:17:39,986 --> 00:17:43,726
This poor creature was found in the men's
room at the rest stop outside of Greendale.

329
00:18:01,106 --> 00:18:03,175
<i>Betty, it's okay, it wasn't Chic.</i>

330
00:18:03,176 --> 00:18:05,076
But it could have been.

331
00:18:05,086 --> 00:18:08,146
Chic is probably out there, with
a bullet in his forehead or...

332
00:18:08,156 --> 00:18:11,816
Or he got away, and he's on
a train back to Transylvania.

333
00:18:11,826 --> 00:18:16,226
I delivered him to the Black Hood, Cheryl.
That makes me a murderer.

334
00:18:16,656 --> 00:18:19,256
I've been trying to prove
that my dad's a killer,

335
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:21,395
When really, all I have to do
was look in the mirror.

336
00:18:21,396 --> 00:18:23,026
Oh, God!

337
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,266
He got what he wanted.

338
00:18:26,036 --> 00:18:27,436
We're the same.

339
00:18:28,576 --> 00:18:31,576
None of this is your fault, Betty.

340
00:18:31,846 --> 00:18:35,106
Part of me wanted to punish
Chic for what he did.

341
00:18:35,116 --> 00:18:39,215
If Chic is dead,
that's a psycho's doing, not yours.

342
00:18:39,216 --> 00:18:41,446
I don't know how much longer
I can keep going

343
00:18:41,456 --> 00:18:43,756
Before I snap and say something.

344
00:18:45,286 --> 00:18:47,055
I think you should say something.

345
00:18:47,056 --> 00:18:49,825
I think you need to confront your father

346
00:18:49,826 --> 00:18:52,196
With as much of the truth as you dare,

347
00:18:52,896 --> 00:18:54,626
And see how he reacts.

348
00:19:03,992 --> 00:19:05,932
I have something to confess.

349
00:19:09,932 --> 00:19:11,432
Well, what is it, honey?

350
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:18,812
While the Black Hood
was first hurting people...

351
00:19:21,312 --> 00:19:23,042
He was also calling me,

352
00:19:23,782 --> 00:19:25,182
Asking me to do things.

353
00:19:26,152 --> 00:19:27,922
He said I was like him.

354
00:19:29,022 --> 00:19:31,492
He offered to help me get rid of Chic.

355
00:19:33,322 --> 00:19:35,922
So I delivered Chic to the Black Hood.

356
00:19:39,602 --> 00:19:41,362
If he's dead,

357
00:19:42,802 --> 00:19:45,472
That makes me
an accomplice to murder.

358
00:19:49,442 --> 00:19:50,872
And I think...

359
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:53,982
I'm okay with that.

360
00:19:55,712 --> 00:19:58,652
The truth is, there's always been
this darkness inside of me...

361
00:20:01,922 --> 00:20:05,052
I thought Chic could help me
understand it, but really...

362
00:20:08,092 --> 00:20:10,122
It was the Black Hood who did.

363
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:14,662
Honey...

364
00:20:17,972 --> 00:20:19,702
I don't know what to say.

365
00:20:23,342 --> 00:20:24,542
Betty...

366
00:20:27,782 --> 00:20:29,442
I experience it, too,

367
00:20:30,012 --> 00:20:31,212
The darkness.

368
00:20:32,422 --> 00:20:34,752
When I was away from you and your mom,

369
00:20:37,192 --> 00:20:39,252
I felt like I was drowning in it...

370
00:20:43,162 --> 00:20:45,662
It's why we need each other.

371
00:20:56,142 --> 00:20:58,772
Jug, did you see it?
See what?

372
00:20:59,142 --> 00:21:01,312
Fangs was dating Midge and
didn't tell Sheriff Keller.

373
00:21:01,312 --> 00:21:02,981
Where'd you get that video?

374
00:21:02,982 --> 00:21:05,681
It was posted on the register's
website, somebody leaked it.

375
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:07,681
It makes Fangs look guilty as sin.

376
00:21:07,682 --> 00:21:10,251
<i>Attention, students.
This is principal Weatherbee.</i>

377
00:21:10,252 --> 00:21:13,021
<i>I need Fangs Fogarty to come
to my office immediately.</i>

378
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:14,261
Where is he?
I don't know.

379
00:21:14,262 --> 00:21:16,122
We have to find him
before the Dark Circle does.

380
00:21:16,832 --> 00:21:18,232
What the hell?

381
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,261
That video's everywhere!
How did it get out?

382
00:21:20,262 --> 00:21:22,562
We have to get you out of here, all right?
You're dead, ViXen killer!

383
00:21:23,472 --> 00:21:24,972
This way...
Mr. Fogarty!

384
00:21:25,472 --> 00:21:28,242
We need you to come with us.
I didn't do anything.

385
00:21:30,442 --> 00:21:33,042
Okay, okay. Come on, come on.
Hey, hey!

386
00:21:40,922 --> 00:21:44,392
I know today is all about the
debate, but I was curious.

387
00:21:44,393 --> 00:21:45,821
Did you get my proposal?

388
00:21:45,822 --> 00:21:49,522
About partnering with <i>Elio</i>'s
family on a modestly-sized casino?

389
00:21:49,532 --> 00:21:51,291
I did, yes.

390
00:21:51,292 --> 00:21:53,801
But no business
<i>Elio</i>'s family runs is legal.

391
00:21:53,802 --> 00:21:57,301
Their casinos are just fronts for
numerous criminal activities.

392
00:21:57,302 --> 00:21:59,832
No, no, daddy,
<i>Elio</i> assured me...

393
00:21:59,842 --> 00:22:02,302
This partnership
just doesn't make sense for us.

394
00:22:02,312 --> 00:22:05,811
Not now, not when we're on the
verge of coming out of the shadows

395
00:22:05,812 --> 00:22:07,642
And into the light, ourselves.

396
00:22:08,482 --> 00:22:10,082
Surely, you understand that?

397
00:22:19,192 --> 00:22:22,392
You don't have to do that.
There's a deputy out there.

398
00:22:23,862 --> 00:22:28,062
What if the deputy falls asleep?
And the Black Hood slips past him?

399
00:22:28,232 --> 00:22:30,931
What if I can't stop him again?
Again?

400
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:33,602
Look, Archie, what happened at pop's...
changed everything, dad.

401
00:22:35,342 --> 00:22:38,942
I really thought you were
going to die, dad. I felt...

402
00:22:41,382 --> 00:22:42,542
Helpless.

403
00:22:43,582 --> 00:22:47,482
Everything broke that day, and I've been
trying to put it back together ever since.

404
00:22:49,022 --> 00:22:51,892
First with the red circle and then...
Hiram Lodge.

405
00:22:53,592 --> 00:22:55,592
Is that what this is about?

406
00:22:55,862 --> 00:22:59,462
You backing him? Working for him?
He makes you feel...

407
00:23:00,762 --> 00:23:02,862
I just hate feeling like
I can't do anything.

408
00:23:02,872 --> 00:23:04,302
I know you do, son.

409
00:23:04,742 --> 00:23:07,742
Especially when it seems like
the whole world is on fire.

410
00:23:21,152 --> 00:23:22,252
All right, war dogs.

411
00:23:23,822 --> 00:23:25,192
Let's have some fun.

412
00:23:30,392 --> 00:23:31,492
Whoo!

413
00:23:45,498 --> 00:23:46,597
Jug, what's up?

414
00:23:46,598 --> 00:23:50,467
You and your Dark Circle went wilding on the
Southside last night, that's what's up!

415
00:23:50,468 --> 00:23:52,307
Wait, hold on.
That... That's impossible.

416
00:23:52,308 --> 00:23:55,437
Unless it was some other vigilante
group in letterman jackets

417
00:23:55,438 --> 00:23:58,977
Who set a dumpster on fire
and slashed our tires!

418
00:23:58,978 --> 00:24:01,047
Archie, hog eye saw you guys!

419
00:24:01,048 --> 00:24:03,647
Jug, I swear, I don't know
anything about this.

420
00:24:03,648 --> 00:24:05,188
<i>I wasn't there.</i>
Jughead?

421
00:24:06,018 --> 00:24:07,548
Attorney McCoy.
Where is he?

422
00:24:10,358 --> 00:24:13,257
You were in Midge Klump's dressing
room doing what, exactly?

423
00:24:13,258 --> 00:24:15,897
We were just talking.
I didn't kill her.

424
00:24:15,898 --> 00:24:18,168
Didn't you? With this knife
you had on your person?

425
00:24:18,968 --> 00:24:20,367
Don't say another word.

426
00:24:20,368 --> 00:24:22,567
I'll be representing Mr. Fogarty
from here on out

427
00:24:22,568 --> 00:24:25,508
And I'd appreciate it,
if you'd stop harassing my client.

428
00:24:29,778 --> 00:24:33,677
You're being held because you were in
possession of a weapon on school property.

429
00:24:33,678 --> 00:24:35,647
My switch-blade's for protection.
Yes.

430
00:24:35,648 --> 00:24:37,847
Well, they have 24 hours
to make something stick.

431
00:24:37,848 --> 00:24:42,658
In the meantime, you exercise your
right to remain the hell silent.

432
00:24:46,698 --> 00:24:50,097
Have you guys lost your minds?
Vandalizing the southside?

433
00:24:50,098 --> 00:24:51,867
We were celebrating Fangs' arrest.

434
00:24:51,868 --> 00:24:54,567
That's not something to celebrate,
you idiot! He didn't do it.

435
00:24:54,568 --> 00:24:56,267
Archie, he had a knife on him.

436
00:24:56,268 --> 00:24:58,267
Okay, we're not having
this argument, you guys.

437
00:24:58,268 --> 00:25:00,037
The circle is officially disbanded.

438
00:25:00,038 --> 00:25:02,107
That's not your decision to make, dude.

439
00:25:02,108 --> 00:25:04,238
You're not the one paying us.
Hiram is.

440
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:06,548
Wait...

441
00:25:11,088 --> 00:25:13,448
Mr. Lodge is paying you?
Yeah.

442
00:25:15,118 --> 00:25:17,518
He's the one that suggested
we go out and have a little fun.

443
00:25:17,528 --> 00:25:21,158
Said you might've started the
Dark Circle, but it was mine now.

444
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:24,227
<i>Veronica,
I'm afraid I've already taken</i>

445
00:25:24,228 --> 00:25:25,928
<i>On my pro Bono case
for the week.</i>

446
00:25:27,198 --> 00:25:30,398
That should cover an hour
of legal advice, I hope.

447
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:34,338
What can I do for you?

448
00:25:34,708 --> 00:25:38,178
Let's say someone wanted
to open a casino in Riverdale.

449
00:25:38,448 --> 00:25:40,678
For starters,
they'd need a gaming license.

450
00:25:40,818 --> 00:25:43,748
Which are difficult to obtain without...

451
00:25:44,748 --> 00:25:46,787
Connections.

452
00:25:46,788 --> 00:25:49,758
Let's say one wanted to do this,
strictly above board.

453
00:26:02,938 --> 00:26:04,867
Has he confessed yet?
No.

454
00:26:04,868 --> 00:26:08,437
But he said something about not being his
best self when my mom kicked him out.

455
00:26:08,438 --> 00:26:11,547
And it was just a hunch, but I got
into his credit card statements

456
00:26:11,548 --> 00:26:14,617
And he's still making weekly
payments to the sharebnb

457
00:26:14,618 --> 00:26:16,678
He'd been renting
even though he's back at home.

458
00:26:16,688 --> 00:26:18,247
Do you think
it's his serial killer lair?

459
00:26:18,248 --> 00:26:20,348
<i>And please tell me
we're breaking in.</i>

460
00:26:40,578 --> 00:26:42,707
What are we looking for, exactly?

461
00:26:42,708 --> 00:26:44,407
Trophies from his victims?

462
00:26:44,664 --> 00:26:49,134
Or just anything unusual
or incriminating.

463
00:26:49,604 --> 00:26:51,034
Hmm.

464
00:26:54,744 --> 00:26:56,114
Betty?

465
00:26:57,584 --> 00:26:59,784
Does your father have
an affinity for kiddie lit,

466
00:26:59,854 --> 00:27:01,754
Or would this be considered unusual?

467
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:06,484
Cheryl...

468
00:27:08,254 --> 00:27:11,663
The Black Hood used this book
to write the cipher,

469
00:27:11,664 --> 00:27:13,624
The cipher that only I could solve.

470
00:27:13,634 --> 00:27:16,564
My dad knew I was obsessed with
this book, growing up.

471
00:27:21,174 --> 00:27:23,134
Oh, my God! It's him.
Don't answer it.

472
00:27:24,074 --> 00:27:26,073
Hi, dad.
Betty, where are you?

473
00:27:26,074 --> 00:27:28,543
Um, I'm at Pop's with Cheryl.

474
00:27:28,544 --> 00:27:31,043
Well, your mom and I are
about to head to the debate.

475
00:27:31,044 --> 00:27:32,683
You want us to wait?
Or pick you up?

476
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:34,884
No, just go ahead.
We'll meet you there.

477
00:27:44,164 --> 00:27:47,693
Daddy, I've done a little research,
and I've figured out how

478
00:27:47,694 --> 00:27:50,594
We can make the casino happen
without involving <i>Elio</i>'s family.

479
00:27:50,604 --> 00:27:52,864
And it's legal, like you asked.
I didn't ask.

480
00:27:53,704 --> 00:27:56,574
And we're moments away from your mother's
debate, so if can we table this?

481
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:01,344
Welcome, one and all,
to tonight's mayoral debate.

482
00:28:07,654 --> 00:28:11,723
Jumping right in.
Fear and unrest rule the streets.

483
00:28:11,724 --> 00:28:15,523
Hermione Lodge, how would you
restore safety to the town?

484
00:28:15,524 --> 00:28:17,854
Well, we're already
making strides, Alice.

485
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:20,963
My husband and I personally recruited

486
00:28:20,964 --> 00:28:24,694
Sheriff Minetta from Centerville
after Tom Keller resigned.

487
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:29,404
Not one week on the job, and he's
apprehended Midge Klump's murderer.

488
00:28:32,804 --> 00:28:34,704
Fred? Rebuttal?

489
00:28:34,714 --> 00:28:36,144
We don't know if he's the killer.

490
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:44,754
All I'm saying is let's not call
for blood until we've had a trial.

491
00:28:46,494 --> 00:28:49,994
What does that say about us,
about Riverdale?

492
00:28:50,164 --> 00:28:53,663
You talk about not calling for blood, Fred?

493
00:28:53,664 --> 00:28:56,694
Are you aware of a group
called the Dark Circle?

494
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:58,963
No, I'm not.
Then let me enlighten you.

495
00:28:58,964 --> 00:29:02,673
The Dark Circle is
a dangerous, radical group

496
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:06,444
That traffics in terror,
violence and street-warfare.

497
00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:07,904
It's a group...

498
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:12,014
Started by your son, Archie.

499
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:17,414
Now I ask you,
citizens of Riverdale...

500
00:29:17,484 --> 00:29:20,884
How can we trust
a man to run a town

501
00:29:20,894 --> 00:29:22,794
When he can't even keep
his own house in order?

502
00:29:23,894 --> 00:29:26,594
Oh, my God!
It's the Black Hood!

503
00:29:30,464 --> 00:29:32,063
Dad?

504
00:29:32,064 --> 00:29:34,934
Mom?

505
00:29:38,204 --> 00:29:40,044
Betty!
Dad?

506
00:29:45,514 --> 00:29:47,784
Are you hurt, son?
Dad, are you okay?

507
00:29:51,716 --> 00:29:53,516
Excuse me.
Thank you.

508
00:29:54,086 --> 00:29:57,086
I guess Sheriff Keller's not looking
so bad right about now, huh?

509
00:29:59,026 --> 00:30:01,155
There's a trapdoor leading
from the balcony to the roof

510
00:30:01,156 --> 00:30:04,595
That's not on any building plans.
But I've got cars all over downtown.

511
00:30:04,596 --> 00:30:06,426
He's not gonna get far,
we'll catch him tonight.

512
00:30:06,436 --> 00:30:08,195
Sheriff, if I may?

513
00:30:08,196 --> 00:30:10,335
Archie's come face-to-face
with the Black Hood before,

514
00:30:10,336 --> 00:30:12,905
Looked him in the eyes.
Maybe he could help identify him.

515
00:30:12,906 --> 00:30:14,206
You up for a ride-along?

516
00:30:21,316 --> 00:30:23,746
Actually, I'm gonna head home,
stay with my dad.

517
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:25,686
Make sure he's safe there.

518
00:30:27,656 --> 00:30:29,016
Yeah...

519
00:30:29,556 --> 00:30:30,956
All right, then.

520
00:30:40,796 --> 00:30:42,465
I just got off the phone with Betty.

521
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:44,235
Apparently, the Black Hood
just turned the town hall

522
00:30:44,236 --> 00:30:46,566
Into his own shooting gallery,
while Fangs was right here.

523
00:30:46,576 --> 00:30:48,175
So why is the Sheriff
still holding him?

524
00:30:48,176 --> 00:30:50,136
What happened tonight
and what happened to Midge

525
00:30:50,146 --> 00:30:52,745
Are being treated as separate incidents.

526
00:30:52,746 --> 00:30:56,976
But if the Sheriff doesn't press charges
in the next hour, he has to let you go.

527
00:30:56,986 --> 00:30:59,646
There are lots of protesters
outside, Jughead.

528
00:30:59,656 --> 00:31:03,786
His release is going to make a lot
of people in this town very unhappy.

529
00:31:10,626 --> 00:31:11,796
Mom,

530
00:31:12,736 --> 00:31:13,896
You're shaking.

531
00:31:16,466 --> 00:31:17,796
I'm fine.

532
00:31:17,806 --> 00:31:20,205
Look, I know you want to be
strong for the campaign,

533
00:31:20,206 --> 00:31:23,206
But if tonight was
any indication of what's to come,

534
00:31:24,876 --> 00:31:26,706
Maybe you should drop out
of the race.

535
00:31:27,676 --> 00:31:28,976
Nobody's withdrawing, <i>mija</i>.

536
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:31,615
Daddy, are you serious?

537
00:31:31,616 --> 00:31:34,015
We've worked too hard on these plans.
We can't get skittish now.

538
00:31:34,016 --> 00:31:37,185
A serial killer just played
target practice with mom!

539
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:39,586
Your father's right, Veronica.

540
00:31:39,926 --> 00:31:42,726
This campaign is bigger
than what happened tonight.

541
00:31:44,196 --> 00:31:45,795
I'll be fine.

542
00:31:45,796 --> 00:31:49,496
He's willing to put your life
in jeopardy and for what?

543
00:31:49,506 --> 00:31:52,566
His plan, his vision, his decisions.

544
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:54,505
You will show me respect in this house.

545
00:31:54,506 --> 00:31:56,176
Like the respect you showed me?

546
00:31:56,506 --> 00:31:59,645
When you asked me to entertain
the sons of your enemies?

547
00:31:59,646 --> 00:32:03,615
Or the respect when I tried to tell you that
I'd worked everything out with the casino?

548
00:32:03,616 --> 00:32:07,086
And you brushed me aside! Well,
guess what, I'm going ahead with it.

549
00:32:08,156 --> 00:32:10,516
I've done the work
and I have the money.

550
00:32:12,126 --> 00:32:14,426
Oh, you mean the money that you
swindled from the St. Claire?

551
00:32:16,396 --> 00:32:20,065
Do you think I'd let my daughter keep
a pile of cash like that lying around?

552
00:32:20,066 --> 00:32:24,336
I put it in a trust that you won't
be able to touch until you're 21,

553
00:32:24,936 --> 00:32:28,176
When hopefully, you'll be more
rational and clear-minded.

554
00:32:44,886 --> 00:32:46,555
Honey, I'm going to meet
your mom down at the register.

555
00:32:46,556 --> 00:32:48,926
Actually, dad, I need to
talk to you about something.

556
00:32:50,466 --> 00:32:51,726
I don't know...

557
00:32:53,396 --> 00:32:57,536
What I saw at the town hall, if
that was really the Black Hood...

558
00:33:00,736 --> 00:33:04,776
Cheryl and I went to your
sharebnb and broke-in.

559
00:33:08,476 --> 00:33:09,945
You and Cheryl?

560
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:12,045
And I found this book

561
00:33:12,046 --> 00:33:15,215
That the Black Hood used for
his cipher all those months ago.

562
00:33:15,216 --> 00:33:16,616
Why do you have it?

563
00:33:16,626 --> 00:33:19,586
I had no idea that
the Black Hood used that book.

564
00:33:20,996 --> 00:33:23,225
All I knew was
it was your favorite.

565
00:33:23,226 --> 00:33:26,226
You checked it out of the library
practically every weekend.

566
00:33:26,236 --> 00:33:29,236
I found a copy online and I was
saving it for your birthday.

567
00:33:32,006 --> 00:33:33,866
What? What are
you talking about?

568
00:33:37,376 --> 00:33:39,306
You didn't think that...

569
00:33:41,816 --> 00:33:43,776
oh, Betty...
Wait, wait. So...

570
00:33:44,846 --> 00:33:49,386
This book is really just a present?

571
00:33:49,856 --> 00:33:50,686
For me?

572
00:33:50,687 --> 00:33:52,526
Of course, Betty.

573
00:33:55,996 --> 00:33:57,056
What else would it be?

574
00:34:01,036 --> 00:34:03,535
Dad, I just got back from
the Sheriff's station.

575
00:34:03,536 --> 00:34:04,936
Fangs is getting out tonight.

576
00:34:07,576 --> 00:34:09,276
Joaquin?

577
00:34:10,206 --> 00:34:11,705
What's he doing here?

578
00:34:11,706 --> 00:34:14,246
I called him.
He's going to help Fangs disappear.

579
00:34:14,776 --> 00:34:17,946
I can sneak him out to San Junipero.
I got a place there.

580
00:34:18,816 --> 00:34:22,215
Maybe. But first, we need to get him out
of that Sheriff's station in one piece.

581
00:34:22,216 --> 00:34:25,186
There's an angry mob outside with pitchforks
and they're yelling for his head!

582
00:34:27,696 --> 00:34:30,456
Something's happening,
and it's gonna make you

583
00:34:31,626 --> 00:34:34,126
And the rest of
the Dark Circle very angry

584
00:34:34,666 --> 00:34:35,866
And frustrated.

585
00:34:39,606 --> 00:34:41,066
Fangs Fogarty

586
00:34:42,006 --> 00:34:43,375
Is being released.

587
00:34:43,376 --> 00:34:45,376
What?
Sometime after midnight.

588
00:34:45,676 --> 00:34:48,076
But there's nothing
you or I can do about it.

589
00:34:53,256 --> 00:34:55,956
Short of taking justice
into your own hands.

590
00:34:57,126 --> 00:34:59,025
We must have faith in
the justice system,

591
00:34:59,026 --> 00:35:02,096
Even if it sometimes allows the guilty

592
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:04,726
To walk free.

593
00:35:10,336 --> 00:35:12,606
Ronnie, what's up?
I came here to see your dad.

594
00:35:13,276 --> 00:35:14,466
Is everything okay?

595
00:35:14,706 --> 00:35:17,006
Everything's fine, Mr. Andrews.
I just...

596
00:35:18,706 --> 00:35:22,215
I wanted to tell you that from now on,
I'm supporting your run for mayor.

597
00:35:22,216 --> 00:35:24,015
I can't in good conscience

598
00:35:24,016 --> 00:35:27,016
Stand with my father anymore.
I believe in you.

599
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:04,372
<i>Betty, is everything okay?</i>

600
00:37:05,102 --> 00:37:06,342
Dad?

601
00:37:09,012 --> 00:37:12,312
I think we need to finish the
conversation we started earlier.

602
00:37:17,022 --> 00:37:19,022
<i>Should I come home, Betty?</i>
No.

603
00:37:21,522 --> 00:37:24,122
Meet me at the place
where this all began.

604
00:37:24,562 --> 00:37:26,622
With my speech at town hall.

605
00:37:27,392 --> 00:37:29,062
You understand?

606
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:31,592
<i>Of course.</i>

607
00:37:31,602 --> 00:37:33,662
I want it to just be
between you and me.

608
00:37:35,972 --> 00:37:38,072
Just how you wanted
it from the beginning.

609
00:37:39,072 --> 00:37:40,472
Just like...

610
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,572
It's supposed to be.

611
00:37:55,668 --> 00:37:57,707
<i>Archie, you gotta get down here.
I'm down at the station...</i>

612
00:37:57,708 --> 00:37:59,407
Jug, slow down, I can't hear you.

613
00:37:59,408 --> 00:38:01,737
I said, get your ass down
to the Sheriff's station.

614
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:03,938
Your guys are here
and they're out of control.

615
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:06,208
Oh, you mean the Dark Circle?
They're not my guys anymore.

616
00:38:06,218 --> 00:38:08,477
Well, they want to rip Fangs apart.

617
00:38:08,478 --> 00:38:10,978
He's getting out and we need
your help, Archie, please!

618
00:38:14,488 --> 00:38:18,257
Justice for Midge!
Justice for Midge!

619
00:38:18,258 --> 00:38:22,698
Free Fangs! Free Fangs!
Free Fangs!

620
00:38:45,274 --> 00:38:48,274
Okay, dad.
Let's talk.

621
00:38:49,084 --> 00:38:51,513
You can't take Fangs out the front.
We have to take the side entrance.

622
00:38:51,514 --> 00:38:53,744
Crowd's out there, too.
So pick your poison, Serpent.

623
00:38:56,024 --> 00:38:58,454
What do we do, man?
I don't wanna die.

624
00:39:02,124 --> 00:39:03,424
Fangs, you're not going to.

625
00:39:04,424 --> 00:39:05,964
Look at me, okay?

626
00:39:07,364 --> 00:39:09,733
We stand together
so none of us falls.

627
00:39:09,734 --> 00:39:11,334
In unity, there is strength.

628
00:39:12,564 --> 00:39:14,534
In unity, there is strength!

629
00:41:00,874 --> 00:41:02,574
No!

630
00:41:37,744 --> 00:41:40,744
I swear, mother, if this is one
of your gentlemen callers...
