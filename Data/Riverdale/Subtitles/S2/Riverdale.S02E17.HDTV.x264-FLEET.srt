1
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:03,768
We should've known better.

2
00:00:04,908 --> 00:00:07,308
I should've known better.

3
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:09,608
We should've driven that
damn car further out of town!

4
00:00:09,808 --> 00:00:11,908
No, no. How could you have
known that junkyard Steve

5
00:00:11,918 --> 00:00:16,348
Drags the swamp for people's castoffs?
It was dumb luck.

6
00:00:16,548 --> 00:00:18,088
It's Jones luck, you mean.

7
00:00:18,288 --> 00:00:20,758
Shouldn't Chic be here, considering
he's the one that brained the guy?

8
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:23,188
Don't worry about Chic.
Normally, I would disagree.

9
00:00:23,388 --> 00:00:26,328
Definitely worry about Chic but he
doesn't know anything about the car.

10
00:00:26,528 --> 00:00:28,658
When we got to the swamp, we wiped
the thing clean of fingerprints

11
00:00:28,668 --> 00:00:30,828
Before we pushed it in.
Wearing gloves?

12
00:00:31,868 --> 00:00:33,328
I think so.
I'm pretty sure.

13
00:00:33,338 --> 00:00:35,068
What do you mean you "think so"?
No, no. We were.

14
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:38,108
We 100% were.

15
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:48,418
If anybody comes around asking
questions, we don't know anything.

16
00:00:48,618 --> 00:00:51,018
We don't talk to anyone. We
act like everything's normal.

17
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:54,488
Including, Betty, you coming home so you're
not nesting with a bunch of serpents.

18
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:57,428
No, you are not gonna use
this to manipulate me, mom.

19
00:00:57,628 --> 00:00:59,288
You know the deal. I come
home when Chic leaves.

20
00:00:59,298 --> 00:01:01,628
Okay...
everybody, be cool.

21
00:01:03,468 --> 00:01:05,728
In the unlikely event that something
happens, we batten down the hatches.

22
00:01:07,238 --> 00:01:10,468
Until then, life goes on, and
nobody goes anywhere near that car.

23
00:01:11,808 --> 00:01:13,038
<i>About last night, Archie,</i>

24
00:01:13,238 --> 00:01:17,078
My associates, Lenny
Kowalski and Carl Martin.

25
00:01:18,448 --> 00:01:21,418
My wife's mayoral campaign
is making them anxious.

26
00:01:21,618 --> 00:01:24,218
I thought Mrs. Lodge being mayor
would be a good thing for everybody.

27
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:26,888
Men like Lenny and Carl
see it as an act of hubris

28
00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:31,388
That could bring us and our business,
unwanted attention from the authorities.

29
00:01:33,228 --> 00:01:34,858
I'm having dinner with them tonight
in the hopes of smoothing it over.

30
00:01:35,058 --> 00:01:37,898
But in the meantime, I need you
to keep a close eye on Veronica.

31
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,498
Do you understand?
Of course, I will.

32
00:01:39,698 --> 00:01:43,238
But in addition to that, what if I
came with you tonight, Mr. Lodge?

33
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:45,588
They know me
from the poker game.

34
00:01:45,788 --> 00:01:47,138
Andre and Adams
will be there, but...

35
00:01:48,578 --> 00:01:50,678
You do always find a way to
make yourself useful, Archie.

36
00:01:50,878 --> 00:01:54,448
And I've tried to get some of my old crew down
from Montreal, but they've gone silent on me.

37
00:01:58,788 --> 00:02:01,658
All right, you're in.

38
00:02:03,988 --> 00:02:05,728
<i>You promised us a war.</i>

39
00:02:05,928 --> 00:02:08,328
Then you're on stage looking like buddy
holly, sucking up to the northside?

40
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:12,198
We need their votes, sweet pea. It's the
only way that we can affect any change.

41
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:14,598
Whoever's elected gets
a seat on the school board.

42
00:02:14,798 --> 00:02:17,808
That means we're on the inside, that
means that they can't silence us.

43
00:02:18,008 --> 00:02:19,838
You and the northside
princess, you mean?

44
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:22,678
Wait, is that why
you guys are pissed?

45
00:02:23,678 --> 00:02:25,478
Betty's on our side!
Yeah.

46
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:28,948
I've helped the serpents
on numerous occasions.

47
00:02:30,188 --> 00:02:31,818
I helped find the pickens
statue's head,

48
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:37,088
I got Cheryl to testify in court so FP,
your king, could get early parole.

49
00:02:37,288 --> 00:02:39,788
You did all that for your
boyfriend, not the serpents.

50
00:02:39,798 --> 00:02:41,698
All right, take it down,
sweet pea...

51
00:02:41,898 --> 00:02:46,298
What, it's only a matter of time before
she bails on us, just like her mother.

52
00:02:46,498 --> 00:02:48,798
Okay, so your objections aren't even
about me, they're about my mom...

53
00:02:48,808 --> 00:02:51,208
Her legacy, yeah. She's an
enemy of the serpent state

54
00:02:51,408 --> 00:02:53,808
Taking shots at us
in the<i> register</i> for years,

55
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:55,738
Blaming us for crimes
we didn't commit.

56
00:02:55,748 --> 00:02:58,648
Running with a turncoat's
daughter is a slap in the face.

57
00:02:58,848 --> 00:03:02,218
And for that reason alone, you're
not getting the serpent vote.

58
00:03:08,758 --> 00:03:11,488
Let's settle this once
and for all.

59
00:03:11,688 --> 00:03:13,288
We're both bulldogs

60
00:03:13,298 --> 00:03:15,758
Who, like wolves,
support the Alpha.

61
00:03:15,768 --> 00:03:20,268
Right now, we risk splitting our boys'
votes, which I told Josie I could deliver.

62
00:03:20,468 --> 00:03:25,038
Hence this contest.
Mantle vs. Andrews.

63
00:03:26,108 --> 00:03:27,808
Winner gets
bulldogs' backing.

64
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:35,478
Give up! You're
gonna lose, Andrews.

65
00:03:36,148 --> 00:03:37,948
Same as your dad...

66
00:03:44,488 --> 00:03:47,088
Talk about my dad like that again,
and next time, I break your arm.

67
00:03:50,968 --> 00:03:52,668
<i>What do you mean,
Cheryl's missing?</i>

68
00:03:52,868 --> 00:03:55,338
Do you remember how paranoid
Cheryl was at her slumber party?

69
00:03:55,538 --> 00:03:57,808
Saying that her mom and Uncle
were out to get her? Mmm-hmm.

70
00:03:58,008 --> 00:04:00,838
Well, I think they did something to her!
What kind of something?

71
00:04:01,038 --> 00:04:05,208
Her mom said they sent her off to some
all-girls boarding school in Switzerland.

72
00:04:05,408 --> 00:04:08,178
Well, that's easy enough to check,
there's only one, surval montreux.

73
00:04:08,378 --> 00:04:10,348
Please. If Cheryl was
in the Swiss alps,

74
00:04:10,548 --> 00:04:12,433
She'd be posting parka
selfies every hour,

75
00:04:12,633 --> 00:04:14,518
But her social media's
been dead for days.

76
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:18,308
Wait, that's a sure
sign of foul play.

77
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,928
Yeah. Whatever you
need, Toni, I'm in.

78
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:24,368
Me, too. Even if we have
to storm thistlehouse.

79
00:04:26,168 --> 00:04:30,138
I believe I've deduced what's caused
this imbalance in you, Cheryl.

80
00:04:31,308 --> 00:04:33,608
And what would that be,
sister Livingston?

81
00:04:33,808 --> 00:04:37,038
I've spoken to your mother
about your brother Jason.

82
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,848
And how close you were.

83
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:45,948
So close, in fact, that your Nana would
sometimes mix you up, isn't that right?

84
00:04:47,558 --> 00:04:51,228
She would dress you in Jason's
clothes and he in yours?

85
00:04:52,298 --> 00:04:53,888
Nana's always been
half-blind, sister.

86
00:04:54,498 --> 00:04:56,028
Cataracts.

87
00:04:56,228 --> 00:04:59,028
But if there's anything
that's affected my psyche,

88
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:02,498
It's the fire hose of abuse directed
at me by my mother and my father.

89
00:05:02,508 --> 00:05:05,868
You've suffered many
traumas, it's true.

90
00:05:06,978 --> 00:05:10,128
But that does not excuse
your willful behavior.

91
00:05:10,328 --> 00:05:13,278
Now, you will report to
the undercroft immediately,

92
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:18,348
Where you will undergo physical
therapy until you're ready to listen.

93
00:05:30,628 --> 00:05:32,498
I'm not gonna
mince words, hiram.

94
00:05:34,338 --> 00:05:38,168
Your wife's campaign is risky, putting
the families in the public eye.

95
00:05:38,368 --> 00:05:41,008
But we understand that ours
is a risk-reward business.

96
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,908
And your idea for
a private prison is intriguing.

97
00:05:45,618 --> 00:05:48,548
So the reward we want for our risk
is a cut of the Riverdale pie.

98
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:50,448
How's 25% sound?

99
00:05:50,648 --> 00:05:53,388
After your cut, I'd be
operating at a loss.

100
00:05:53,588 --> 00:05:56,358
So, Lenny, Carl,

101
00:05:57,488 --> 00:06:00,428
Respectfully,
I decline your kind offer.

102
00:06:04,668 --> 00:06:07,838
With all due respect, hiram,
you're all alone here.

103
00:06:09,238 --> 00:06:11,338
Your boys from Montreal, from
New York, they work for us now.

104
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,338
And who've you got out here
in the boonies, hmm?

105
00:06:14,978 --> 00:06:16,878
A couple of low-level capos and
some zit-faced high school kid.

106
00:06:25,148 --> 00:06:27,658
Mr. Kowalski. Mr. Martin.

107
00:06:27,858 --> 00:06:31,128
Respectfully. Don't underestimate Mr.
Lodge or me.

108
00:06:31,328 --> 00:06:35,228
Archie. I rearranged Nick St.
Clair's pretty-boy face for him.

109
00:06:36,868 --> 00:06:38,828
I took care of poppa poutine after
he conspired with you, Lenny.

110
00:06:40,268 --> 00:06:42,098
And when some hillbilly threatened Mr.
Lodge's daughter

111
00:06:42,108 --> 00:06:45,008
At his safe house, I did the
same thing to him, too.

112
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:48,108
So don't think for a second
that we're defenseless.

113
00:06:57,388 --> 00:06:58,848
You nearly had us
there, red.

114
00:07:00,258 --> 00:07:03,688
Hiram, consider our offer.
Yeah.

115
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,688
In the meantime, we'll be
sticking around Riverdale,

116
00:07:06,698 --> 00:07:09,558
Taking in some of the local flavors.
Sound good?

117
00:07:10,128 --> 00:07:11,568
Yeah.

118
00:07:16,008 --> 00:07:18,738
You were a mad dog in there, Archie.
You do realize that, don't you?

119
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,338
I wasn't gonna let them disrespect
you, sir. Not in our town.

120
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:23,973
Nevertheless, you fire
a warning shot like that,

121
00:07:24,173 --> 00:07:26,608
You gotta be ready to back
it up, do you understand?

122
00:07:28,988 --> 00:07:30,348
Good.

123
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:32,948
You're a good boy, Archie.

124
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:43,898
<i>What do sweet pea and fangs
want from me, anyway?</i>

125
00:07:44,098 --> 00:07:47,468
What will it take for them to accept me?
Do I need to wear plaid?

126
00:07:48,738 --> 00:07:51,308
Do I need to get a leather jacket?
Or a snake tattoo?

127
00:07:51,508 --> 00:07:54,738
To be fair, your mother
is serpent enemy no. 1.

128
00:07:54,938 --> 00:07:57,778
And meanwhile, the shady man's
car is out there somewhere

129
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,613
And we have no idea
what's going on with it.

130
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,448
Yeah, I've been thinking
about that, actually.

131
00:08:02,588 --> 00:08:04,118
I know that our parents
told us to act "normal,"

132
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,388
And let sleeping dogs lie,

133
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:10,158
But riddle me this...
What is our "normal"?

134
00:08:11,428 --> 00:08:14,028
Normal is...

135
00:08:15,868 --> 00:08:18,998
Investigating something when the
entire world tells us we shouldn't.

136
00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:22,138
Pumping our sources
for information...

137
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:27,273
<i>why do you guys
even care about this car?</i>

138
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:30,038
We don't, we care
about the environment.

139
00:08:30,048 --> 00:08:33,108
And we're writing an article
about how people

140
00:08:33,118 --> 00:08:35,033
Use swedlow swamp
as a dumping ground.

141
00:08:35,233 --> 00:08:36,948
The car's just part
of a larger story.

142
00:08:37,148 --> 00:08:39,348
Well, according to my dad, it was
claimed by its owner this morning.

143
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:43,158
The owner...

144
00:08:45,128 --> 00:08:47,628
Who's in Riverdale?
Yeah.

145
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:51,298
Now they're trying to figure out
who stole it in the first place.

146
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,828
Has shacking up together driven
you both completely insane?

147
00:09:00,028 --> 00:09:02,028
Talking to the sheriff's son
about that car?

148
00:09:02,038 --> 00:09:04,098
You didn't think that that was
going to raise any red flags?

149
00:09:04,298 --> 00:09:05,498
No. Kevin didn't
suspect anything.

150
00:09:05,508 --> 00:09:07,038
And at least, we know
what's going on now.

151
00:09:07,238 --> 00:09:10,978
Yeah. Which is that Chic's
drug-dealer stole someone's car

152
00:09:11,178 --> 00:09:12,778
Before he made
his run to our house.

153
00:09:12,978 --> 00:09:15,778
Dwayne didn't have wheels. He was
always borrowing his girlfriend's car.

154
00:09:15,978 --> 00:09:18,178
Someone called the shady
man's phone while I had it.

155
00:09:18,188 --> 00:09:19,648
And she sounded
like a crazy person,

156
00:09:19,848 --> 00:09:23,018
But not like there was a lot of
love lost between her and Dwayne.

157
00:09:23,218 --> 00:09:24,358
That could be Darla, yeah.

158
00:09:24,558 --> 00:09:26,858
Is this Darla somebody that
we need to be worried about?

159
00:09:27,728 --> 00:09:28,888
Uh, I don't really know her.

160
00:09:28,898 --> 00:09:30,458
Shocker! Gee, Chic,

161
00:09:30,658 --> 00:09:32,558
Have you ever actually been
helpful in any way to anyone?

162
00:09:32,568 --> 00:09:35,198
Enough, Elizabeth! Right. Whoa,
let's stick to the plan.

163
00:09:35,398 --> 00:09:36,898
This has nothing
to do with us.

164
00:09:37,098 --> 00:09:40,503
Dwayne stole Darla's car, Darla got
it back. Let's hope it ends there.

165
00:09:40,703 --> 00:09:44,108
And pack your things, Betty, because
this honeymoon is over. O-ver.

166
00:09:44,308 --> 00:09:46,508
You two playing house
and running around town

167
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,763
Like loose cannons
is beyond the pale.

168
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,818
We don't want hal
finding out about this.

169
00:09:51,018 --> 00:09:53,018
The last thing we need is for
him to stick his nose in it.

170
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:54,418
I'll move out.

171
00:09:56,318 --> 00:09:58,558
I'll get a place, Betty.
It's your house, not mine.

172
00:09:58,758 --> 00:09:59,758
Fine.

173
00:10:00,928 --> 00:10:02,428
I'll come back
after Chic's gone.

174
00:10:02,628 --> 00:10:05,128
Oh, I'm done with your ultimatums,
young lady. You're coming home now!

175
00:10:05,328 --> 00:10:06,928
And if you don't
back me up on this, FP,

176
00:10:07,128 --> 00:10:09,898
I will tear this trailer
apart with my bare hands.

177
00:10:19,978 --> 00:10:21,378
Fine.

178
00:10:26,348 --> 00:10:28,648
I'll go get my stuff.
I'll help you pack.

179
00:10:44,968 --> 00:10:48,308
But, foolish girl,
what have you done?

180
00:10:48,508 --> 00:10:50,978
You've stacked the bags
in the north-east corner,

181
00:10:51,178 --> 00:10:53,778
When I specifically
told you the north-west.

182
00:10:53,978 --> 00:10:55,778
What?
No, no, you said...

183
00:10:55,978 --> 00:11:00,088
Start over. And next
time, listen, child.

184
00:11:01,558 --> 00:11:04,358
You'll never get better
if you don't listen to me.

185
00:11:07,588 --> 00:11:09,688
<i>Now that
you've barged your way in,</i>

186
00:11:09,698 --> 00:11:12,198
Go ahead, girls,
ask your questions.

187
00:11:12,398 --> 00:11:15,498
You said Cheryl was away
at some boarding school?

188
00:11:17,168 --> 00:11:20,973
Honestly. I'm not in the habit of
explaining myself to school girls.

189
00:11:21,173 --> 00:11:24,978
Maybe not, but Mrs. Blossom, you may
have heard that my mother is...

190
00:11:25,978 --> 00:11:28,148
Dating sheriff Keller.

191
00:11:29,748 --> 00:11:31,418
If you won't tell us the truth,
then maybe you'll tell him.

192
00:11:31,618 --> 00:11:32,818
All right, then.

193
00:11:33,488 --> 00:11:36,458
The truth is that Cheryl

194
00:11:36,658 --> 00:11:40,528
Started exhibiting strange,
deviant behavior,

195
00:11:40,728 --> 00:11:43,228
So I've sent her abroad to
a private wellness institute

196
00:11:43,428 --> 00:11:45,078
Where they're trying
to help her.

197
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:46,928
You don't
have to believe me...

198
00:11:48,038 --> 00:11:49,228
But here, let me
show you something...

199
00:11:57,138 --> 00:11:59,838
Oh my God!
She's drawn dozens like it.

200
00:12:00,808 --> 00:12:02,508
I don't understand.
No.

201
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:04,678
But Josie does, don't you?

202
00:12:04,688 --> 00:12:06,788
Cheryl was obsessed with you.

203
00:12:06,988 --> 00:12:09,648
To the point where I was
afraid she might hurt you,

204
00:12:10,318 --> 00:12:12,018
Or herself, or both.

205
00:12:13,788 --> 00:12:15,958
So if you'd like me to tell that
to your mother and her boyfriend,

206
00:12:16,158 --> 00:12:19,658
And show them and the town,

207
00:12:19,668 --> 00:12:21,768
Cheryl's drawings of you,
I'd be happy to.

208
00:12:21,968 --> 00:12:25,768
But hopefully, you girls have the
decency to keep this matter private.

209
00:12:30,178 --> 00:12:33,678
Josie, wait! Slow down!
We need to regroup!

210
00:12:34,848 --> 00:12:36,818
If what Mrs. Blossom said
is even a tiny bit true,

211
00:12:37,018 --> 00:12:39,018
That means that Cheryl
threatened me.

212
00:12:39,918 --> 00:12:41,088
Sent me a bloody pig's heart.

213
00:12:42,158 --> 00:12:44,258
I'm out, you guys.
I'm done!

214
00:12:54,598 --> 00:12:56,298
Sulk all you want, Betty.

215
00:12:57,268 --> 00:12:58,598
I'm not.

216
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:01,608
I was actually gonna see if you
would sign something for me.

217
00:13:02,378 --> 00:13:04,708
A consent form.

218
00:13:05,908 --> 00:13:07,548
What, are you trying
to get emancipated now?

219
00:13:07,748 --> 00:13:09,148
Just because I made
you move back home?

220
00:13:09,348 --> 00:13:11,048
It's so I could
get a tattoo.

221
00:13:11,618 --> 00:13:12,918
A serpent tattoo.

222
00:13:15,188 --> 00:13:17,688
You have lousy
timing, kiddo.

223
00:13:18,558 --> 00:13:19,988
Act normal, right?

224
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,458
Life goes on,
doesn't it?

225
00:13:22,658 --> 00:13:26,158
You are not getting a tattoo just to
prove something to your boyfriend.

226
00:13:26,168 --> 00:13:29,028
Absolutely not! I'm practically
a member of the serpents.

227
00:13:29,038 --> 00:13:30,998
Do not say that!
Well, do not think

228
00:13:31,198 --> 00:13:33,438
That I won't find a tattoo
parlor that will do it.

229
00:13:36,038 --> 00:13:37,938
Mom! Betty!

230
00:13:39,448 --> 00:13:40,948
I was trying to help.

231
00:13:41,948 --> 00:13:44,133
You must be Alice.

232
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:46,518
And you must be Betty.

233
00:13:47,148 --> 00:13:48,748
Hi. I'm Darla.

234
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,388
Okay, well,

235
00:13:54,588 --> 00:13:56,358
What about
something like, uh...

236
00:13:58,498 --> 00:14:01,328
"I'm all about investing in all the citizens
of Riverdale, not just profiting from them."

237
00:14:01,528 --> 00:14:04,238
I like that, jug. I mean,
that's great, it's simple...

238
00:14:04,438 --> 00:14:06,038
Dad.
Hey.

239
00:14:06,238 --> 00:14:07,608
Jug, what's going on?

240
00:14:07,808 --> 00:14:09,978
Oh, jug's helping me
out here with the, uh...

241
00:14:10,178 --> 00:14:11,778
It's what your mom's calls
my "announcement address."

242
00:14:11,978 --> 00:14:16,048
I'm not much for speechifying, but
jug is the greatest writer I know.

243
00:14:17,248 --> 00:14:19,378
Uh, then you need to meet
more writers, Mr. Andrews.

244
00:14:22,218 --> 00:14:23,558
Oh, by the way, son,
your mom told me

245
00:14:23,758 --> 00:14:25,858
You'll be stopping by
at the announcement, right?

246
00:14:26,058 --> 00:14:27,088
I appreciate that.

247
00:14:31,028 --> 00:14:35,298
Honestly, I'm not surprised that deadbeat
Dwayne borrowed my car without asking.

248
00:14:35,498 --> 00:14:37,838
He does it all the time.

249
00:14:39,538 --> 00:14:44,938
What did surprise me was the car
turning up in a swamp in Riverdale.

250
00:14:44,948 --> 00:14:48,948
And then, just as I was getting
ready to head back to Centerville,

251
00:14:49,678 --> 00:14:51,078
Chic called me.

252
00:14:51,848 --> 00:14:53,418
Why would you do that?

253
00:14:54,788 --> 00:14:56,118
He thought he could
sniff out how much I knew.

254
00:14:56,318 --> 00:14:58,658
Isn't that right, Chic-a-Dee?

255
00:14:58,858 --> 00:15:01,288
But there's no playing a player,
I saw right through him.

256
00:15:05,598 --> 00:15:08,368
It's okay,
Dwayne was a heel.

257
00:15:08,568 --> 00:15:10,498
I wouldn't be surprised
if he stole my car

258
00:15:10,698 --> 00:15:14,708
To pick up some floozy
only to get himself killed.

259
00:15:21,008 --> 00:15:22,648
Like I told Chic...

260
00:15:24,148 --> 00:15:27,088
I don't particularly care
what happened to Dwayne.

261
00:15:28,388 --> 00:15:31,588
I don't see any reason to
ask any questions about him,

262
00:15:31,788 --> 00:15:34,188
Especially not if I get
the ten grand he owes me.

263
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:40,898
I get that, I'm a happy camper who'll be
out of your lives forever ever. Amen.

264
00:15:41,768 --> 00:15:44,698
If not...
Well, then...

265
00:15:46,338 --> 00:15:51,138
I might just have to have a long talk
with that handsome sheriff of yours.

266
00:15:53,008 --> 00:15:54,748
We have nothing to do with... we don't
have that kind of money on hand.

267
00:15:54,948 --> 00:15:58,448
But if we get the money for
you, we're done here, right?

268
00:15:58,648 --> 00:16:00,318
You'll leave,
no questions asked?

269
00:16:01,388 --> 00:16:03,318
Zip my mouth
and throw away the key.

270
00:16:05,628 --> 00:16:08,088
Okay. We'll go to the bank and
make a withdrawal. Nah, uh-uh.

271
00:16:08,628 --> 00:16:09,758
One of you goes.

272
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:12,998
Betty, then.
Betty will go.

273
00:16:14,498 --> 00:16:18,268
Mom, the bank's not open
until 9:00 tomorrow morning.

274
00:16:18,468 --> 00:16:21,008
I don't mind waiting.
Got any board games?

275
00:16:22,378 --> 00:16:24,078
<i>It's seriously
messed-up, Ronnie.</i>

276
00:16:24,278 --> 00:16:27,108
It's like me and my dad don't even know
how to talk to each other anymore.

277
00:16:27,308 --> 00:16:29,878
You'll work it out.
You always do.

278
00:16:31,318 --> 00:16:34,918
And God and Gucci willing,
Cheryl's safe, wherever she is.

279
00:16:42,798 --> 00:16:44,158
Andre?

280
00:16:48,968 --> 00:16:50,998
Hey!
Archie, don't!

281
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:57,978
It's all right.
It's okay.

282
00:17:07,718 --> 00:17:09,018
Adams?

283
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,288
You double-crossing
piece of...

284
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:19,198
Tell your girlfriend's father
to take the deal.

285
00:17:29,838 --> 00:17:31,538
So, Adams has been turned...

286
00:17:31,548 --> 00:17:33,378
God knows how long
he's been working against us.

287
00:17:33,578 --> 00:17:36,148
Kowalski and Martin must
have offered him a tidy sum.

288
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:39,748
Or he sensed that we're weak, vulnerable,
and he chose to align with our enemies.

289
00:17:39,948 --> 00:17:42,618
Either way, he's made a
grave mistake. Yeah.

290
00:17:44,088 --> 00:17:46,038
The message from
Lenny and Carl is clear.

291
00:17:46,238 --> 00:17:48,188
Either cut us in
or suffer the consequences.

292
00:17:48,198 --> 00:17:50,798
And with Adams a turncoat
and Andre in the hospital,

293
00:17:51,798 --> 00:17:53,198
We are, essentially,
unprotected.

294
00:17:55,168 --> 00:17:57,498
I'll keep watch in the lobby. I did it
for my dad, I'll do it for you guys.

295
00:17:57,698 --> 00:17:59,068
That's a selfless
offer, Archie.

296
00:17:59,268 --> 00:18:01,868
But, alas, a short-term solution
to a long-term problem.

297
00:18:01,878 --> 00:18:04,378
So what do we do?
We circle the wagons.

298
00:18:04,578 --> 00:18:07,608
Hermione, any of the campaigning
you need to do, you do from here.

299
00:18:07,808 --> 00:18:10,718
Veronica, if you're not at school, you're
here. I don't want you out and about.

300
00:18:10,918 --> 00:18:13,448
Archie, you escort her to and fro.
Absolutely.

301
00:18:13,648 --> 00:18:15,688
And long-term?
What's the plan?

302
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:18,918
Long-term...
Long-term...

303
00:18:20,488 --> 00:18:22,058
I have no idea.

304
00:18:29,998 --> 00:18:32,568
It's our joint-account, so you
shouldn't have any trouble.

305
00:18:32,768 --> 00:18:33,608
Okay.

306
00:18:36,078 --> 00:18:40,548
Hey! Straight to the bank
and right back, blondie.

307
00:18:51,558 --> 00:18:54,378
Now, roseanne, you behave
yourself while I'm out.

308
00:18:54,578 --> 00:18:57,398
You've been fed, you've
been to the water closet,

309
00:18:57,598 --> 00:18:59,398
You should be set
till I come back.

310
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:01,768
If you have to go,
hold it.

311
00:19:02,998 --> 00:19:04,468
You can spend the day
watching your programs.

312
00:19:56,418 --> 00:19:59,558
On the 14th of July in 1789,

313
00:19:59,758 --> 00:20:03,558
A state prison on the east side
of Paris, known as the bastille...

314
00:20:03,758 --> 00:20:07,128
<i>antoinette topaz
to the principal's office.</i>

315
00:20:07,328 --> 00:20:11,068
<i>Antoinette topaz, please report
to the principal's office.</i>

316
00:20:22,448 --> 00:20:24,948
Call for you.
She said it was urgent.

317
00:20:28,358 --> 00:20:31,488
Hello?
She's not far away.

318
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,588
Who... who is this?

319
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,428
Cheryl!
She's nearby.

320
00:20:37,628 --> 00:20:40,828
Nana rose?
Nana rose, where is she?

321
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:44,968
With the sisters of...

322
00:20:47,338 --> 00:20:49,968
Hello? Nana rose!

323
00:20:57,748 --> 00:20:59,718
Now, whatever do you
think you're doing, mother?

324
00:21:06,328 --> 00:21:07,988
Hey, mom. I'm just
about to head out.

325
00:21:08,188 --> 00:21:11,498
<i>No, Elizabeth. There's another
one in the house now.</i>

326
00:21:12,828 --> 00:21:14,028
What? What are you
talking about?

327
00:21:14,228 --> 00:21:17,598
The guy that attacked Chic
at the hostel, that manager?

328
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:19,638
Oh, my God!
Should I call someone?

329
00:21:19,838 --> 00:21:20,908
I don't know.

330
00:21:21,108 --> 00:21:24,908
Just, Elizabeth, whatever
you do, do not come home.

331
00:21:25,108 --> 00:21:26,938
Mom!

332
00:21:34,218 --> 00:21:37,188
<i>Wait, so that was Nana rose
Blossom who paged you?</i>

333
00:21:37,388 --> 00:21:39,118
Yeah, it was.

334
00:21:39,128 --> 00:21:41,928
Although, we got disconnected before she
could say too much beyond the fact that

335
00:21:42,128 --> 00:21:45,698
Cheryl was nearby and that
she was with the sisters.

336
00:21:45,898 --> 00:21:48,698
The sisters? What sisters?
I don't know.

337
00:21:48,898 --> 00:21:52,098
Maybe there's a re-education
camp called the sisters.

338
00:21:54,108 --> 00:21:58,438
Well, there's a sisters of quiet mercy,
but that's more like an orphanage.

339
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,148
I don't think they do
gay conversion there.

340
00:22:01,348 --> 00:22:02,608
Well, who
would know for sure?

341
00:22:03,318 --> 00:22:04,848
Oh, my God, of course!

342
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:08,318
<i>Yes, it absolutely could be
the sisters of quiet mercy.</i>

343
00:22:08,518 --> 00:22:11,588
It's one of the few places in the country
that still does conversion therapy.

344
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,258
Of the books, of course.

345
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,458
What the hell decade is this?

346
00:22:15,658 --> 00:22:19,258
During prohibition, the sisters
ran a distillery in the basement.

347
00:22:19,268 --> 00:22:21,528
They used to smuggle booze
out to Sweetwater river

348
00:22:21,728 --> 00:22:23,628
Via a tunnel that
still exists today.

349
00:22:23,638 --> 00:22:25,868
Wait, a tunnel we could use
to get to Cheryl?

350
00:22:26,068 --> 00:22:29,338
Potentially. Gay boys in the
program use it to sneak out,

351
00:22:29,538 --> 00:22:33,043
To hook-up with perfectly nice young
men like myself in fox forest.

352
00:22:33,243 --> 00:22:36,748
Wait, Kevin, can you lead us to
this secret gay hook-up tunnel?

353
00:22:36,948 --> 00:22:38,363
I can probably find it.

354
00:22:38,563 --> 00:22:39,978
But we should go at night.

355
00:22:43,588 --> 00:22:45,058
Why did you come back, Betty?

356
00:22:46,828 --> 00:22:48,628
You know, it took more than a week to
get that pepper spray out of my eyes.

357
00:22:48,828 --> 00:22:51,358
Well, next time maybe, don't attack
my brother with a box-cutter.

358
00:22:52,568 --> 00:22:55,128
It's all here.
Nice work.

359
00:22:55,138 --> 00:22:57,318
Okay, well you have
your money. Now, go!

360
00:22:57,518 --> 00:22:59,698
What're you talking about?
I just got here.

361
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:03,008
Yeah. And Riverdale's so
much nicer than Centerville.

362
00:23:04,278 --> 00:23:07,348
And this house,
I could get used to this house.

363
00:23:08,748 --> 00:23:10,048
You said if we gave you the
money, you'll leave. Chic!

364
00:23:10,248 --> 00:23:12,518
Or what? You think
you three can take us?

365
00:23:12,988 --> 00:23:14,118
Try it.

366
00:23:14,988 --> 00:23:16,218
Sit your ass down, Chic.

367
00:23:16,418 --> 00:23:19,158
Or I'll cut out
your sister's eyes.

368
00:23:29,268 --> 00:23:31,038
You think you two
can take all of us?

369
00:23:31,668 --> 00:23:33,138
Try it.

370
00:23:33,338 --> 00:23:34,738
You brought back-up?

371
00:23:36,608 --> 00:23:39,578
Does that mean you want me to go to
the sheriff's, start making a stink?

372
00:23:39,778 --> 00:23:42,208
Well, that's your call
but my back-up and me,

373
00:23:42,218 --> 00:23:46,678
We're friends with the sheriff's son,
so whose side do you think he'll pick?

374
00:23:48,348 --> 00:23:49,848
The coopers are one of the most
respected families in Riverdale.

375
00:23:51,018 --> 00:23:53,223
You two are just a couple
of Centerville scumbags.

376
00:23:53,423 --> 00:23:55,428
Anything that was in your car,
the swamp washed away,

377
00:23:55,628 --> 00:23:59,328
Else we'd have heard about it by now, so
why don't you just grab the money and run.

378
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:33,418
Sorry about
your door, Mrs. Cooper.

379
00:24:36,258 --> 00:24:37,558
Thank you, jughead.

380
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:39,758
Thank your friends
for me.

381
00:24:40,928 --> 00:24:42,668
We're serpents.
It's what we do.

382
00:24:45,538 --> 00:24:48,338
Betty, you've been telling me
something that I didn't want to hear.

383
00:24:49,468 --> 00:24:50,608
And I'm sorry.

384
00:24:52,278 --> 00:24:53,608
But Chic...

385
00:24:55,948 --> 00:24:57,948
You've put us
in danger twice now.

386
00:24:58,678 --> 00:25:00,048
So I think that...

387
00:25:01,348 --> 00:25:03,618
You should do what you said
and leave this house.

388
00:25:05,388 --> 00:25:08,518
I will. I'll find a place.

389
00:25:10,398 --> 00:25:11,888
Do it quickly.

390
00:25:13,258 --> 00:25:14,358
Because you're not gonna
spend another night here.

391
00:25:21,168 --> 00:25:25,138
I appreciate you escorting me home
but I'm in for the rest of the night

392
00:25:25,338 --> 00:25:28,948
So you, archiekins,
are officially off-duty.

393
00:25:29,978 --> 00:25:31,248
Hey Archie,
do you have a minute?

394
00:25:32,348 --> 00:25:34,118
Yeah, of course, Mr. Lodge.

395
00:25:34,988 --> 00:25:36,318
I'll see you tomorrow.

396
00:25:45,228 --> 00:25:47,128
<i>I've made
my decision, Archie.</i>

397
00:25:47,328 --> 00:25:51,068
If I don't let Kowalski and Martin
invest in the prison, they'll destroy it

398
00:25:51,268 --> 00:25:52,698
And everything
I'm trying to build here.

399
00:25:52,898 --> 00:25:55,608
These men don't share
my ambition to go legitimate.

400
00:25:57,308 --> 00:25:58,668
By "invest," you mean you'll pay
them a cut for "protection"?

401
00:25:58,678 --> 00:26:00,928
And I won't risk a war
nor my family's safety.

402
00:26:01,128 --> 00:26:03,378
Not at this moment,
not when we're defenseless.

403
00:26:09,118 --> 00:26:10,418
Mr. Lodge?

404
00:26:11,888 --> 00:26:14,318
You haven't told them
you're agreeing yet, have you?

405
00:26:15,388 --> 00:26:16,428
Well, I am meeting them
for dinner tonight.

406
00:26:18,028 --> 00:26:20,798
Why? What are you thinking?

407
00:26:25,938 --> 00:26:28,068
I think maybe
we should just start.

408
00:26:29,708 --> 00:26:31,108
Yeah, maybe you're right.

409
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:33,938
I'm sorry, Fred.

410
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:39,078
It's okay. You know,
he's busy. I get it.

411
00:26:40,088 --> 00:26:41,648
I'm glad you're here though.

412
00:26:52,658 --> 00:26:54,998
Good afternoon.
My name is Fred Andrews.

413
00:26:56,468 --> 00:27:00,268
And I stand before you today,
a humble resident of this town

414
00:27:00,468 --> 00:27:03,938
To announce
my candidacy for mayor.

415
00:27:04,138 --> 00:27:05,608
<i>We're on
opposite sides, Andrews.</i>

416
00:27:05,808 --> 00:27:06,878
Why should I help you?

417
00:27:07,078 --> 00:27:09,848
At school, we're on
opposite sides, yes.

418
00:27:10,048 --> 00:27:13,348
But bigger pictures, Reggie, where do you
stand? With the lodges or against them?

419
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:16,588
I'm against the southside.
My dad's for the prison so am I.

420
00:27:16,788 --> 00:27:18,318
Me too. I think
it's the future.

421
00:27:18,518 --> 00:27:20,918
But somebody from the outside
is threatening that.

422
00:27:20,928 --> 00:27:24,828
And we need to show them that that
is not how things go in Riverdale.

423
00:27:25,028 --> 00:27:27,858
Stand with me tonight and the
bulldogs' votes are yours.

424
00:27:39,778 --> 00:27:42,708
Sorry, I had to wait for my
parents to do bed-check.

425
00:27:52,758 --> 00:27:54,188
Movie night.

426
00:27:54,958 --> 00:27:56,828
Clean yourself up.

427
00:28:12,438 --> 00:28:13,878
According
to my intel,

428
00:28:14,078 --> 00:28:16,548
The tunnel that leads from the
main residence comes out here.

429
00:28:16,748 --> 00:28:18,548
Okay.
That's our way in, then.

430
00:28:19,548 --> 00:28:20,978
All right, Kevin,
you stay here.

431
00:28:20,988 --> 00:28:22,848
If we're not back in 15
minutes, call your dad.

432
00:28:23,048 --> 00:28:24,018
Okay.

433
00:28:53,048 --> 00:28:56,348
Okay. And when we get to the main
building, what happens then?

434
00:28:56,548 --> 00:28:59,418
We search each and every
damn room until we find her.

435
00:28:59,618 --> 00:29:01,618
Let's go.

436
00:29:11,838 --> 00:29:14,538
Okay, let's split up.
We'll cover twice the ground.

437
00:29:14,738 --> 00:29:16,538
Okay. But be careful.
Okay.

438
00:29:20,178 --> 00:29:21,638
Cheryl!

439
00:29:27,518 --> 00:29:28,778
Cheryl!

440
00:29:32,058 --> 00:29:34,518
Cheryl, are you in here?

441
00:29:35,488 --> 00:29:37,458
Toni?
We came to rescue you.

442
00:29:37,658 --> 00:29:38,528
You did?

443
00:30:04,418 --> 00:30:06,718
Cheryl, Toni, there are
a bunch of nuns coming.

444
00:30:06,918 --> 00:30:07,988
We have to go, come on!

445
00:30:16,298 --> 00:30:17,598
This way!

446
00:30:50,668 --> 00:30:52,028
Come on!

447
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:02,478
Let's go!

448
00:31:08,248 --> 00:31:09,548
I don't understand.

449
00:31:10,248 --> 00:31:11,288
Is he standing us up?

450
00:31:12,588 --> 00:31:14,388
Maybe our first message
wasn't clear enough.

451
00:31:15,288 --> 00:31:16,588
Mr. Kowalski.
Mr. Martin.

452
00:31:16,788 --> 00:31:19,198
That was hiram lodge calling
with his deep regrets.

453
00:31:20,898 --> 00:31:22,828
And to say that you should both go outside.
To check on your car.

454
00:31:36,608 --> 00:31:37,978
What the hell is this?

455
00:31:46,358 --> 00:31:48,618
This is a message
from the dark circle.

456
00:31:48,628 --> 00:31:52,558
Hiram lodge doesn't stand alone.
And Riverdale is protected.

457
00:31:52,758 --> 00:31:54,358
You should leave
before it's too late.

458
00:32:07,388 --> 00:32:10,818
Before I leave, I don't
suppose you could tell me,

459
00:32:12,528 --> 00:32:15,028
What was so important that you
couldn't be there for your dad?

460
00:32:15,228 --> 00:32:17,028
Believe me, I had
every intention of going.

461
00:32:17,228 --> 00:32:18,758
You used to worship
your father,

462
00:32:18,768 --> 00:32:20,568
You used to play music.

463
00:32:20,768 --> 00:32:23,468
You, jughead, Betty,
you were inseparable!

464
00:32:23,668 --> 00:32:27,468
But I'm looking at you now and
I don't know who you've become.

465
00:32:30,008 --> 00:32:31,908
Who are you, Archie?

466
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:36,178
<i>I asked jughead
to thank you for me,</i>

467
00:32:36,378 --> 00:32:39,348
But I reconsidered, because
I wanted to do it myself.

468
00:32:40,348 --> 00:32:42,748
So, thank you
for what you did.

469
00:32:43,918 --> 00:32:45,258
I also wanted you
to hear it directly from me

470
00:32:45,458 --> 00:32:49,358
<i>That I am done attacking
and disavowing the southside.</i>

471
00:32:50,958 --> 00:32:54,228
<i>It's where I'm from,
and I should be proud of that.</i>

472
00:32:55,668 --> 00:32:57,938
<i>And from now on, I will be.</i>

473
00:32:58,708 --> 00:32:59,938
<i>And like my daughter,</i>

474
00:33:01,108 --> 00:33:03,978
<i>I will fight tooth
and nail for it.</i>

475
00:33:05,908 --> 00:33:08,408
There he is.
Came as soon as I could.

476
00:33:09,648 --> 00:33:11,478
New wheels, Mr. Lodge?
Indeed. But not mine.

477
00:33:12,218 --> 00:33:13,248
The car's yours, Archie.

478
00:33:14,588 --> 00:33:16,418
Ronnie, Mr. And Mrs. Lodge,
I can't accept this.

479
00:33:16,618 --> 00:33:18,618
Especially, since,
from now on,

480
00:33:18,628 --> 00:33:20,658
You're going to be driving our
daughter wherever she needs to go.

481
00:33:22,898 --> 00:33:25,758
Say yes, Archie.
Say yes!

482
00:33:28,568 --> 00:33:30,083
Yeah. Yes!

483
00:33:30,283 --> 00:33:31,798
Great.

484
00:33:32,668 --> 00:33:33,638
I'll get the engine started.

485
00:33:36,538 --> 00:33:40,908
Now, Archie. Last night was the very
definition of a short-term solution.

486
00:33:41,108 --> 00:33:42,078
I'm fully aware of that.

487
00:33:44,588 --> 00:33:46,178
But our enemies will be back,

488
00:33:47,288 --> 00:33:50,088
And not just for 25%.
For everything.

489
00:33:51,118 --> 00:33:52,158
We'll be ready for them, sir

490
00:33:54,158 --> 00:33:56,828
Get in, lover boy.
I'll drive us to school!

491
00:34:02,568 --> 00:34:04,098
Be careful!

492
00:34:07,008 --> 00:34:08,968
So, now that you're free,

493
00:34:08,978 --> 00:34:10,538
What's your first move gonna be?

494
00:34:10,738 --> 00:34:14,748
Well, Toni, if revenge is
a dish best served cold,
