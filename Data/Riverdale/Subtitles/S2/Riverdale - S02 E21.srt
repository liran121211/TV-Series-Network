1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,250
Previously on Riverdale...

2
00:00:01,253 --> 00:00:03,760
- The Conway murders?
- They were a family of five.

3
00:00:03,762 --> 00:00:05,028
I found justice.

4
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:07,197
What if Mr. Svenson
wasn't the Black Hood?

5
00:00:07,199 --> 00:00:09,499
The real Black Hood
could still be alive.

6
00:00:09,502 --> 00:00:11,707
My Dad might be the Black Hood.

7
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:15,132
I don't know. I've seen your
father sneak around Thistlehouse...

8
00:00:16,031 --> 00:00:17,306
Lodge is a problem.

9
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:19,876
Did you have anything to do
with Papa Poutine's death?

10
00:00:19,878 --> 00:00:21,912
His son Small Fry is
looking for payback.

11
00:00:22,562 --> 00:00:24,234
Penny, you wanna deal drugs?

12
00:00:24,237 --> 00:00:25,992
It's not gonna be with the Serpents.

13
00:00:25,995 --> 00:00:27,656
That used to be my Serpent tattoo.

14
00:00:27,659 --> 00:00:29,356
- You're nuts!
- She will be back.

15
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,989
Our old adversaries, the
Ghoulies, have been released.

16
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:34,028
Word on the street is that
they want Serpent blood.

17
00:00:34,031 --> 00:00:36,762
- Midge?
- You're dead, Vixen killer!

18
00:00:36,765 --> 00:00:38,766
Mr. Fogarty, we need
you to come with us.

19
00:00:38,769 --> 00:00:40,444
- I din't kill her.
- Didn't you?

20
00:00:40,447 --> 00:00:44,045
His release is going to make a lot
of people in this town very unhappy.

21
00:00:44,048 --> 00:00:45,601
The Circle is officially disbanded.

22
00:00:45,603 --> 00:00:47,471
You're not the one paying us. Hiram is.

23
00:00:47,473 --> 00:00:49,700
Fangs Fogarty is being released.

24
00:00:49,703 --> 00:00:51,288
What?

25
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:54,378
Well, they wanna rip Fangs
apart. We need your help, Archie!

26
00:00:59,952 --> 00:01:02,152
Okay, Dad. Let's talk.

27
00:01:02,155 --> 00:01:04,875
I swear, Mother, if this is
one of your gentlemen callers...

28
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:50,143
I suggest you run whilst you still can.

29
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,270
I only miss when I mean to.

30
00:02:04,483 --> 00:02:06,683
Help us! We need a doctor.

31
00:02:06,685 --> 00:02:08,395
- Ma'am.
- Wait your turn, please.

32
00:02:08,398 --> 00:02:10,068
- He was shot!
- I need you to step back...

33
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,260
- He's dying!
- Hey, what's gong on here?

34
00:02:12,263 --> 00:02:13,863
My friend was shot right in the stomach.

35
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:15,199
Hey, get me a gurney.

36
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:16,539
Here, here, here.

37
00:02:16,542 --> 00:02:19,009
Lift up, lift up.

38
00:02:19,012 --> 00:02:20,845
Let's go.

39
00:02:20,848 --> 00:02:22,915
Hang in there, hang in there.

40
00:02:24,734 --> 00:02:26,336
Jug, where do you think you're going?

41
00:02:26,338 --> 00:02:27,671
To find the guy who shot Fangs!

42
00:02:27,673 --> 00:02:29,406
You're not going out there.
Not with people rioting.

43
00:02:29,408 --> 00:02:31,775
Look, you're angry, you
want justice. So do I.

44
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:33,410
But you've got a fallen
soldier here, boy,

45
00:02:33,412 --> 00:02:34,911
and we need to talk to his family.

46
00:02:34,914 --> 00:02:37,280
- It's part of being a leader.
- Some leader I am.

47
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,449
Don't go down that road.

48
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:41,885
All right, come on. Come on.

49
00:02:54,366 --> 00:02:55,565
Oh.

50
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,550
Cheryl.

51
00:03:02,553 --> 00:03:05,020
The Black Hood just
attacked me at Thistlehouse.

52
00:03:05,023 --> 00:03:06,356
Oh, my God.

53
00:03:06,945 --> 00:03:08,378
Was it my dad?

54
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,047
Based on waistline alone,
it could've been him, yes.

55
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:13,950
Luckily, I was able to get to
my archery set and hunting cape.

56
00:03:13,952 --> 00:03:16,536
- You didn't kill him, did you?
- No.

57
00:03:16,539 --> 00:03:18,755
I shot to wound, hit him
in the right shoulder.

58
00:03:18,758 --> 00:03:21,319
He's fled into the woods,
where I plan to track him.

59
00:03:21,322 --> 00:03:24,358
But just in case he escapes
my clutches, be forewarned.

60
00:03:24,361 --> 00:03:27,781
Now that he's a maimed animal,
he's operating on instinct,

61
00:03:27,784 --> 00:03:31,945
ready to lash out and
kill anyone in his path,

62
00:03:31,948 --> 00:03:33,500
even his loved ones.

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,840
Here, include that.

64
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:41,378
Elizabeth, thank goodness.

65
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,926
Mom, are you okay? Have you seen Dad?

66
00:03:43,929 --> 00:03:46,049
He's out covering the
riot. Honey, where are you?

67
00:03:46,051 --> 00:03:48,030
The streets aren't safe.
You need to get here.

68
00:03:48,033 --> 00:03:49,832
I'm on my way, but stay put, okay?

69
00:03:49,835 --> 00:03:52,656
I'm not going anywhere. It's
a big night for The Register.

70
00:03:52,658 --> 00:03:55,358
If it bleeds, it leads.
Get over here now.

71
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,765
- Hey, Arch...
- It's just me, Mr. Andrews.

72
00:04:01,768 --> 00:04:04,401
I was about to slip
out. Is something wrong?

73
00:04:04,404 --> 00:04:07,939
On the news, it said a riot broke
out down at the Sheriff's Station.

74
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,173
Where is Archie?

75
00:04:11,742 --> 00:04:13,968
- Where the hell is Reggie?
- I thought he was with you.

76
00:04:13,971 --> 00:04:15,737
We got separated when
the fight broke out.

77
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,953
Guys, Reggie had a gun.

78
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:18,815
He didn't shoot Fangs, though.
I tackled him before he could.

79
00:04:18,817 --> 00:04:19,823
Why would Reggie have a gun?

80
00:04:19,825 --> 00:04:21,484
I can guess who put
the idea in his head.

81
00:04:21,486 --> 00:04:22,919
But right now, we just gotta find him.

82
00:04:22,921 --> 00:04:24,721
Some of the Serpents
saw Reggie with the gun.

83
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:26,156
They're gonna go after him.

84
00:04:26,158 --> 00:04:28,095
Kev, Moose, we'll
head to Reggie's house.

85
00:04:28,098 --> 00:04:30,232
Everyone else, fan out,
call if you find him.

86
00:04:32,362 --> 00:04:34,775
Archie was there when
that Serpent got shot.

87
00:04:34,778 --> 00:04:37,178
- I don't know what he's caught up in.
- I'm coming with you.

88
00:04:42,941 --> 00:04:46,076
Good evening, Mr. Andrews.
I'm here to pick up, Ms. Lodge.

89
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,947
Thank you, Andre. Yes,
bring her directly home.

90
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,947
Okay.

91
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,791
Now that we know Veronica's safe,

92
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,087
one of Minetta's deputies will
take you over to The Register.

93
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:58,688
Alice is waiting for your announcement.

94
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,458
Well, there's no way of
controlling what could happen.

95
00:05:01,461 --> 00:05:03,293
Hiram, it's a huge gamble.

96
00:05:03,295 --> 00:05:06,897
No, the fire's started, mi
amor. Chaos is good for us.

97
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,167
We have the pieces in place
to restore order and safety.

98
00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:14,437
Fred doesn't. Andre will
keep watch on Veronica.

99
00:05:20,412 --> 00:05:23,380
- Where will you be?
- Out with another deputy.

100
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:25,882
Hiram?

101
00:05:30,929 --> 00:05:33,722
You're not keeping
anything from me, right?

102
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:37,627
Don't start doubting me now, mi amor.

103
00:05:45,981 --> 00:05:48,038
Excuse me, ma'am. How's Fangs Fogarty?

104
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,439
He's still in surgery.

105
00:05:49,441 --> 00:05:51,321
I'll want to talk to him
as soon as he wakes up.

106
00:05:52,187 --> 00:05:53,589
Sheriff Minetta...

107
00:05:53,592 --> 00:05:56,172
Shouldn't you be on the street
looking for who shot Fangs?

108
00:05:56,175 --> 00:05:58,175
There's already a manhunt underway.

109
00:05:58,186 --> 00:06:01,099
Your little Serpent pals aren't
making things easy, though.

110
00:06:01,102 --> 00:06:04,753
Rioting, carousing, terrorizing the
neighborhood. Already arrested a few.

111
00:06:04,756 --> 00:06:08,325
Fangs wouldn't have a slug in his gut if
you'd done your job in the first place.

112
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:10,794
I don't know the details
of your parole, Mr. Jones,

113
00:06:10,796 --> 00:06:13,396
but I'm certain harassing an
officer would violate them.

114
00:06:16,234 --> 00:06:17,334
Jug?

115
00:06:17,337 --> 00:06:19,427
Mr. Lodge, it's me, Reggie.

116
00:06:20,504 --> 00:06:24,073
I need your help. Someone
shot Fangs. It wasn't me.

117
00:06:24,076 --> 00:06:26,229
But I was there and now the
Southsiders think I did it.

118
00:06:26,231 --> 00:06:29,245
That's unfortunate, Reggie,
but I'm afraid I can't help you.

119
00:06:39,663 --> 00:06:42,427
Oh, my God, is that Mrs. Klump?

120
00:06:43,929 --> 00:06:45,195
Andre, stop the car!

121
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:47,697
That's Midge's mom.

122
00:06:51,636 --> 00:06:53,236
Ms. Veronica, wait.

123
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:54,513
Mrs. Klump?

124
00:06:55,506 --> 00:06:57,906
Are you okay?

125
00:06:57,909 --> 00:07:00,076
I may have killed that boy.

126
00:07:03,816 --> 00:07:05,482
Archie, what the hell is going on?

127
00:07:05,484 --> 00:07:07,984
- The Serpents are going nuts.
- Yeah.

128
00:07:07,986 --> 00:07:09,452
Reggie shot Fangs!

129
00:07:09,454 --> 00:07:12,033
No, dude, I was with Reggie
when it happened, it wasn't him.

130
00:07:12,036 --> 00:07:13,469
So you need to call off your crew.

131
00:07:13,472 --> 00:07:15,258
- We're just leaving Reggie's house now.
- Did they find him?

132
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,127
No, he wasn't home. We're
headed to the high school now.

133
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:18,728
That's where Mrs. Mantle
said they were going.

134
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,296
Okay, I'm on my way.

135
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:22,888
Whenever you're ready, Hermione.

136
00:07:22,891 --> 00:07:24,735
As a mayoral candidate,

137
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:28,802
I feel it's important to take
charge in times of crisis.

138
00:07:28,805 --> 00:07:30,991
Like this riot, which I believe

139
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,766
is brought about by the
actions of the Black Hood.

140
00:07:33,769 --> 00:07:37,094
Which is why I would
like to offer a bounty.

141
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:42,451
$1 million to whoever can
deliver the Black Hood.

142
00:07:42,454 --> 00:07:45,655
Alive or preferably, dead.

143
00:07:48,726 --> 00:07:52,117
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

144
00:07:54,089 --> 00:07:55,697
A bounty?

145
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,167
What are you talking
about? Is that even legal?

146
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:01,409
The Black Hood is an active
shooter on the streets of Riverdale.

147
00:08:01,412 --> 00:08:04,164
He tried to kill one of your classmate
outside the Sheriff's Station.

148
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:06,560
No, no. The Black Hood
did not shoot Fangs.

149
00:08:06,562 --> 00:08:08,862
Excuse me, young lady?
How would you know that?

150
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:11,431
Did anyone actually see the Black
Hood at the Sheriff's station?

151
00:08:11,433 --> 00:08:14,301
And why exactly are you being
protective of a murderer?

152
00:08:17,073 --> 00:08:19,034
Cheryl, any new leads?

153
00:08:19,037 --> 00:08:21,698
- Where are you right now?
- I'm at The Register, why?

154
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:24,539
He's exited the forest and he's
headed for the houses beyond the pines.

155
00:08:24,542 --> 00:08:26,179
Maybe even yours.

156
00:08:26,181 --> 00:08:28,114
- I have to go.
- Wait, cousin.

157
00:08:28,116 --> 00:08:30,951
Do not go into that house alone.

158
00:08:30,953 --> 00:08:33,753
I have to find my dad
before anyone else does.

159
00:08:33,755 --> 00:08:35,862
Otherwise, he's a dead man walking.

160
00:08:43,498 --> 00:08:45,065
That's gotta be the Southsiders.

161
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:46,128
Serpent scum!

162
00:08:46,131 --> 00:08:48,634
Settle down, Moose. We're
out manned and unarmed.

163
00:08:48,637 --> 00:08:50,386
I'm not just gonna hide here
while they trash our school!

164
00:08:50,388 --> 00:08:51,938
- I'm with Moose.
- All right.

165
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,341
But it's us three against
who knows how many.

166
00:08:54,343 --> 00:08:57,177
So if we're gonna do
this, we gotta gear up.

167
00:09:04,319 --> 00:09:06,853
Ronnie, can I call you back?
I'm kinda busy, a riot broke out.

168
00:09:06,855 --> 00:09:10,223
Yes, Archie, I know. I was
just out in the middle of it.

169
00:09:10,225 --> 00:09:11,891
What? I thought you
were still at my house?

170
00:09:11,893 --> 00:09:14,194
Not only did I brave the streets,

171
00:09:14,196 --> 00:09:17,831
I delivered Fangs's shooter,
Mrs. Klump, to the authorities.

172
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:20,333
- Mrs. Klump shot Fangs?
- Can you blame her?

173
00:09:20,335 --> 00:09:23,303
I gotta go, Ronnie, I gotta tell
the Serpents, but I love you.

174
00:09:23,305 --> 00:09:24,771
I love you, too.

175
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:30,406
Mom?

176
00:09:30,409 --> 00:09:31,845
Sheriff Minetta?

177
00:09:31,848 --> 00:09:33,579
Veronica, what are you doing here?

178
00:09:33,582 --> 00:09:34,914
You're supposed to
be at home with Andre.

179
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:37,083
Andre's in the car, We
had to make a detour.

180
00:09:38,754 --> 00:09:40,687
Good Lord, Mom!

181
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:44,250
Are you and Daddy trying to
turn Riverdale into Gotham City?

182
00:09:50,265 --> 00:09:52,666
Serpents, stop!

183
00:09:53,935 --> 00:09:57,570
Well, Fellas, looks like we
found some bulldogs to put down.

184
00:09:58,299 --> 00:10:02,275
Sweet Pea, I swear, Reggie didn't
shoot Fangs. It was Mrs. Klump.

185
00:10:02,277 --> 00:10:03,910
Bull. I saw Mantle with the gun!

186
00:10:03,912 --> 00:10:06,846
Then you also saw me tackle
him, before he got a shot off!

187
00:10:06,849 --> 00:10:09,190
It was Midge's mom!
She's down at the station.

188
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:11,945
Yeah, and Fangs is
still clinging to life.

189
00:10:11,948 --> 00:10:15,221
And whether it was Reggie or
Mrs. Klump who pulled the trigger,

190
00:10:15,223 --> 00:10:16,990
a Northsider put him there.

191
00:10:16,993 --> 00:10:19,870
You took our friend, our land...

192
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,526
And you'll take everything
if we give you the chance.

193
00:10:25,934 --> 00:10:27,937
So now you get to watch

194
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:31,128
as we burn your school to the ground.

195
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:51,024
What the hell do you boys
think you're doing to my school?

196
00:10:55,097 --> 00:10:57,397
Hello? Dad?

197
00:11:08,944 --> 00:11:10,276
Dad...

198
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,281
You're too late, Jughead.

199
00:11:15,283 --> 00:11:17,484
Well, you try Mad Max-ing
your way through a riot.

200
00:11:17,486 --> 00:11:19,419
- What happened in the school?
- Weatherbee shut us down.

201
00:11:19,421 --> 00:11:21,921
- And kicked our asses out.
- Then the Serpents took off again.

202
00:11:21,923 --> 00:11:23,523
- Do you know where?
- Yeah, they went down Fernleaf.

203
00:11:23,525 --> 00:11:25,225
- Probably to Midge Klump's house.
- Why there?

204
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:29,242
To trash it. Because I told them
Mrs. Klump shot Fangs, not Reggie.

205
00:11:29,245 --> 00:11:31,765
Jughead, you have to
coax them off the ledge.

206
00:11:31,768 --> 00:11:33,447
- Yeah, I'm on it.
- Wait...

207
00:11:34,135 --> 00:11:36,401
- You spoken to Betty?
- She's with her mom.

208
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,904
Keep in touch.

209
00:11:37,907 --> 00:11:39,173
You, too.

210
00:11:43,645 --> 00:11:45,378
- Hello.
- Archie, it's Pop.

211
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,276
I've got a friend of yours here.

212
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,564
I think he needs help.

213
00:12:07,169 --> 00:12:08,401
Hello?

214
00:12:08,404 --> 00:12:09,674
Betty, it's FP.

215
00:12:09,677 --> 00:12:11,838
I'm at Riverdale
General, is Jug with you?

216
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,765
Mr. Jones, no, I... I
don't know where he is.

217
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:17,043
All right, if you see him, you
tell him I'm looking for him, okay?

218
00:12:17,045 --> 00:12:19,579
- Of course, I will.
- Also, uh...

219
00:12:19,582 --> 00:12:22,415
Betty, they just brought
your old man into the ER.

220
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:23,817
My dad?

221
00:12:24,586 --> 00:12:26,653
Is he hurt badly?

222
00:12:26,656 --> 00:12:29,022
I don't know. He's bleeding quite
a bit. You want me to check on him?

223
00:12:29,024 --> 00:12:32,458
No. That's okay, Mr.
Jones. I'm on my way.

224
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:34,753
Where do you plan on
getting the million dollars

225
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,345
to pay for this lunatic bounty?

226
00:12:36,347 --> 00:12:38,481
Your father has secret funds.

227
00:12:38,484 --> 00:12:40,250
My ass, he does.

228
00:12:40,253 --> 00:12:42,267
And if Daddy thinks he can use my money

229
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:45,438
for one of his Machiavellian
ploys, he better think again.

230
00:12:45,441 --> 00:12:48,240
Because I'm taking back what
I got from the St. Clairs.

231
00:12:48,243 --> 00:12:51,744
Your father already told you he'd
put that money in a trust for you!

232
00:12:51,746 --> 00:12:53,479
He stole it, you mean!

233
00:12:57,219 --> 00:12:58,451
Veronica!

234
00:12:58,515 --> 00:12:59,848
Veronica!

235
00:12:59,851 --> 00:13:04,479
You're wasting your time.
Your money is not in there.

236
00:13:04,482 --> 00:13:07,562
Veronica, just open the door
and we can talk about this.

237
00:13:46,563 --> 00:13:49,231
I didn't know where else to
go. Mr. Lodge left me hanging.

238
00:13:49,234 --> 00:13:53,072
Wait, Reggie, I know he paid
you to trash the Whyte Wyrm.

239
00:13:53,074 --> 00:13:55,208
But did he put you up to this?

240
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,776
Guys? Outside.

241
00:14:02,117 --> 00:14:04,317
Sepents! They're coming for me.

242
00:14:07,124 --> 00:14:08,187
Archie, what's up?

243
00:14:08,189 --> 00:14:09,699
Jughead, where the hell are you guys?

244
00:14:09,702 --> 00:14:11,724
I just got the Serpents
back to the Whyte Wyrm.

245
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,393
Mrs. Klump's house is secure.

246
00:14:13,396 --> 00:14:14,827
What's wrong?

247
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:17,664
Well, if the Serpents are with you,
then who the hell is out here at Pop's?

248
00:14:20,802 --> 00:14:22,068
Oh, crap.

249
00:14:22,071 --> 00:14:23,770
Jug?

250
00:14:23,772 --> 00:14:25,638
That's right, I'm here.

251
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,540
Looks like the Ghoulies
are back in town.

252
00:14:41,029 --> 00:14:43,229
Damm it! Nobody's answering
at the Sheriff's station.

253
00:14:43,232 --> 00:14:45,409
Looks like we're on our own.

254
00:14:45,411 --> 00:14:47,525
Okay, we should be fine
as long as everybody...

255
00:14:47,527 --> 00:14:49,747
Everybody, get away from the windows!

256
00:14:52,251 --> 00:14:53,651
Stay down!

257
00:14:57,857 --> 00:15:00,891
Do you have a gun in here, Pop?

258
00:15:00,894 --> 00:15:02,493
No.

259
00:15:02,495 --> 00:15:04,641
Had my fill of gunfire back in the war.

260
00:15:04,644 --> 00:15:07,498
But I learned a trick
in the riots of '79.

261
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,367
I have Mr. Lodge's leftover
liquor from that poker night.

262
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,063
And you get to the roof
through the crawlspace...

263
00:15:13,066 --> 00:15:14,805
I like how you're thinking, Pop.

264
00:15:18,211 --> 00:15:20,711
Anyone want to come out and play?

265
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:24,055
We got some new toys to show you!

266
00:15:24,058 --> 00:15:26,050
Hey!

267
00:15:35,847 --> 00:15:37,294
Come on.

268
00:15:37,863 --> 00:15:39,129
Hit me!

269
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,709
All right, now it's a party!

270
00:15:54,647 --> 00:15:56,245
Come on, let's go. Let's go!

271
00:16:00,386 --> 00:16:01,885
Get the hell outta here.

272
00:16:06,693 --> 00:16:08,759
Mr. Keller, I thought you resigned.

273
00:16:08,762 --> 00:16:11,329
Turned in my badge,
but not the cruiser yet.

274
00:16:11,332 --> 00:16:12,732
How did you guys know we were here?

275
00:16:12,735 --> 00:16:15,654
Well, Jug called, said you were
in trouble so I called your dad...

276
00:16:15,657 --> 00:16:17,704
right when Kevin called.

277
00:16:17,707 --> 00:16:19,917
We're not letting this town
go down without a fight.

278
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,644
Hot Riverdale Dads to the Rescue.

279
00:16:22,647 --> 00:16:24,331
I can't just sit here...

280
00:16:24,334 --> 00:16:27,370
You don't have a choice,
Sweet Pea, you're staying put.

281
00:16:28,214 --> 00:16:30,475
You said it yourself,
the Ghoulies are back!

282
00:16:30,478 --> 00:16:31,884
We will deal with them.

283
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,124
As soon as my dad gets back...

284
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:36,127
Oh, so you're not our
leader all of a sudden?

285
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:39,141
Oh, no, that's right, you're
just the guy who got Fangs shot!

286
00:16:39,144 --> 00:16:40,953
- Watch it...
- And now, Fangs might die!

287
00:16:40,956 --> 00:16:44,495
And the Ghoulies are out for our blood
because of a drag race you started.

288
00:16:46,265 --> 00:16:49,533
An hour. That's all I'm
asking for, Sweet Pea.

289
00:16:56,956 --> 00:17:00,524
This is utterly vile. Daddy
has already written the story.

290
00:17:00,527 --> 00:17:04,148
About the affair you and Fred
had. What was he planning to do?

291
00:17:04,151 --> 00:17:07,714
Publish that in The Register?
And drag you both through the mud?

292
00:17:07,717 --> 00:17:10,019
Fred's running on family values.

293
00:17:10,966 --> 00:17:12,633
I'm the law and order candidate.

294
00:17:12,636 --> 00:17:15,024
Your father believes an October Surprise

295
00:17:15,027 --> 00:17:17,688
like this one would
hurt me, but I'd survive.

296
00:17:17,691 --> 00:17:20,105
And it would utterly
destroy Fred's campaign.

297
00:17:20,108 --> 00:17:21,536
Wait, you're in on this?

298
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:23,172
There's a game plan, Veronica.

299
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:26,100
What kind of man would
do this to his own wife?

300
00:17:26,103 --> 00:17:28,070
I'll tell you! The kind of man

301
00:17:28,073 --> 00:17:30,407
who always has someone
else to take the risk,

302
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:33,778
to stand in the line of
fire, to run for Mayor.

303
00:17:35,147 --> 00:17:36,814
That's what you are to him.

304
00:17:36,817 --> 00:17:40,084
A means to an end.
Kindling for the fire.

305
00:17:40,086 --> 00:17:42,186
Oh, no, Veronica.

306
00:17:42,189 --> 00:17:44,949
Your father would never
put us in harm's way.

307
00:17:44,952 --> 00:17:48,712
The fact that you still believe
that after everything he's done,

308
00:17:48,715 --> 00:17:50,682
chills me, Mom.

309
00:17:53,144 --> 00:17:55,602
Pop Tate, I heard there was
an incident at the diner.

310
00:17:55,605 --> 00:17:57,367
Rioters were here, Mr. Lodge.

311
00:17:57,369 --> 00:18:00,586
But Fred Andrews showed up
with Tom Keller and FP Jones.

312
00:18:00,589 --> 00:18:04,107
They saved us, helped defend the
Chock'lit Shoppe from the Ghoulies.

313
00:18:04,109 --> 00:18:06,543
- Everyone's calling them heroes.
- I see.

314
00:18:06,545 --> 00:18:08,679
Well, thank you, Pop.

315
00:18:08,681 --> 00:18:11,982
- And, uh, I'm glad you're okay.
- All right.

316
00:18:18,624 --> 00:18:21,464
Sorry, we're not serving right now.

317
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:25,753
So that wasn't Hiram Lodge you
were just speaking with, was it?

318
00:18:25,756 --> 00:18:28,597
- It was.
- He's an old friend of my father's.

319
00:18:29,495 --> 00:18:31,888
You wouldn't happen to know
where he lives, would you?

320
00:18:33,949 --> 00:18:35,248
Excuse me?

321
00:18:35,251 --> 00:18:38,714
Um, my dad is here. Hal
Cooper, what room is he in?

322
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:41,816
Uh, 221. Just down the hall.

323
00:18:53,092 --> 00:18:54,524
Dad?

324
00:18:57,329 --> 00:18:59,262
Oh.

325
00:19:09,174 --> 00:19:11,475
We keep missing each other.

326
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,203
You murdered Dr. Masters?

327
00:19:16,206 --> 00:19:18,782
He asked too many questions.

328
00:19:18,784 --> 00:19:22,085
So there's no method to the
killing, now? No grand design?

329
00:19:22,087 --> 00:19:23,954
You're just a run-of-the-mill psychopath?

330
00:19:23,956 --> 00:19:25,822
You need to come home, Betty.

331
00:19:25,825 --> 00:19:28,258
So we can talk and finish this.

332
00:19:28,261 --> 00:19:29,683
Fine.

333
00:19:30,763 --> 00:19:32,829
You don't scare me.

334
00:19:33,866 --> 00:19:35,532
Your mother's here.

335
00:19:38,237 --> 00:19:40,735
What? Mom's there?

336
00:19:40,738 --> 00:19:43,206
If you're not home in 10 minutes,
or if you call the police,

337
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,704
I will slit your mother's throat
in the middle of the living room.

338
00:19:45,706 --> 00:19:48,042
No.

339
00:19:57,623 --> 00:20:00,090
- Hello.
- Hello, lover boy.

340
00:20:00,093 --> 00:20:02,025
It's your old gal pal.

341
00:20:02,028 --> 00:20:03,061
Penny?

342
00:20:04,363 --> 00:20:05,896
You picked a really bad time.

343
00:20:05,898 --> 00:20:07,264
Oh, I heard.

344
00:20:07,266 --> 00:20:10,133
Riverdale, burning to
the ground? It's tragic.

345
00:20:10,135 --> 00:20:12,502
How about we meet up
and talk about it, hmm?

346
00:20:12,504 --> 00:20:14,667
Your old hangout, by the docks?

347
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,132
Why the hell would I do that?

348
00:20:16,135 --> 00:20:19,331
Because if you don't, I'll start
carving up your girlfriend's face.

349
00:20:19,334 --> 00:20:20,910
Betty?

350
00:20:20,913 --> 00:20:23,880
Oh, please. Ponytail's a snooze!

351
00:20:23,882 --> 00:20:27,517
No, I mean your Southside Smurfette.

352
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,152
What do you think I should start with?

353
00:20:29,154 --> 00:20:31,477
Tell her to go to hell, Jughead.

354
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,256
Hmm, maybe her tongue, huh?

355
00:20:33,258 --> 00:20:35,358
Come now. And alone.

356
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,928
It'll just be me and Pinkie here.

357
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:40,997
- Mom? Mom, where are you?
- Oh.

358
00:20:40,999 --> 00:20:42,949
Betty, thank God you're okay.

359
00:20:42,952 --> 00:20:45,407
- I've been calling you. Where have you been?
- Mom, is Dad here?

360
00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:47,671
- Quick, is he here or is he not? Where is he?
- Yeah, honey. Why?

361
00:20:47,673 --> 00:20:49,072
- What... What's going on?
- We have to go.

362
00:20:49,074 --> 00:20:50,073
- What?
- We have to leave.

363
00:20:50,075 --> 00:20:51,941
- We have to go.
- Betty!

364
00:20:51,944 --> 00:20:53,410
You made it home.

365
00:20:53,413 --> 00:20:56,113
You dad has some crazy idea

366
00:20:56,115 --> 00:20:59,299
to show us old home movies.

367
00:20:59,302 --> 00:21:03,086
I figured we'd indulge him since
we're practically on lock-down anyway.

368
00:21:04,289 --> 00:21:06,189
What's wrong?

369
00:21:08,494 --> 00:21:12,863
Well, I'm just happy
we're all here as a family.

370
00:21:12,865 --> 00:21:14,364
Sit down, Betty.

371
00:21:14,366 --> 00:21:17,100
I think you're really
going to enjoy this.

372
00:21:28,064 --> 00:21:30,095
Now, remember, I'm making this movie

373
00:21:30,098 --> 00:21:33,359
so we never forget what
your daddy sacrificed for us.

374
00:21:33,362 --> 00:21:35,763
You do love your daddy,
don't you, Harold?

375
00:21:35,766 --> 00:21:37,266
Yes, Mom.

376
00:21:37,269 --> 00:21:40,178
And you want your daddy
to keep living with us?

377
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,779
Yes, Mom.

378
00:21:41,782 --> 00:21:43,481
I don't understand,
what are we watching?

379
00:21:43,483 --> 00:21:45,670
- Is that you, Hal?
- It is.

380
00:21:45,673 --> 00:21:48,619
Your daddy did something
very noble, Harold.

381
00:21:48,621 --> 00:21:51,116
He took care of that Conway family.

382
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:54,125
They were sinners. And
what happens to sinners?

383
00:21:54,127 --> 00:21:55,960
Sinners have to die.

384
00:21:55,962 --> 00:21:57,061
Oh, my God!

385
00:21:57,064 --> 00:21:58,930
What is this, a snuff film?

386
00:21:58,932 --> 00:22:02,624
Shut the hell up, Alice,
for once in your life!

387
00:22:02,627 --> 00:22:03,901
That's right.

388
00:22:03,903 --> 00:22:06,790
Now, That little
Conway boy who survived,

389
00:22:06,793 --> 00:22:09,327
they're going to ask him
who killed his family.

390
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:13,600
He needs to point out somebody,
anybody, but not Daddy.

391
00:22:13,603 --> 00:22:17,100
Because we don't want Daddy to
be taken away from us, do we?

392
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:19,830
No, I love my daddy.

393
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:21,366
So you have to help him.

394
00:22:21,369 --> 00:22:23,721
Make sure that when
they ask the Conway boy

395
00:22:23,723 --> 00:22:25,356
who he saw kill his family,

396
00:22:25,358 --> 00:22:28,116
make sure he doesn't say Daddy.

397
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:30,366
Can you do that, Harold? Convince him?

398
00:22:30,369 --> 00:22:31,829
I think so.

399
00:22:31,832 --> 00:22:33,831
You're a good boy, Hal.

400
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:38,302
Your father let him escape,
but you, you will do better.

401
00:22:38,304 --> 00:22:40,104
You must do better.

402
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,374
Take out your taperecorder, Alice.

403
00:22:45,278 --> 00:22:47,311
I need you to record this.

404
00:22:49,616 --> 00:22:53,288
The Conways, that was the family
that was murdered 40 years ago?

405
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:54,685
Yes. Oh, my God!

406
00:22:54,687 --> 00:22:56,154
Take it out!

407
00:22:59,066 --> 00:23:02,368
And I want to tell my story.

408
00:23:03,204 --> 00:23:05,671
No, our story, really.

409
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,500
First, to clear something up.

410
00:23:09,503 --> 00:23:14,772
Your Great-Grandpappy Cooper wasn't
murdered by his brother, like some dog.

411
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:18,194
He was the killer.

412
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:20,358
He killed Great-Grandpappy Blossom

413
00:23:20,361 --> 00:23:25,342
and then took on the Cooper name to
create a new identity for himself.

414
00:23:25,345 --> 00:23:26,984
For us.

415
00:23:26,987 --> 00:23:29,619
What does that have
to do with the Conways?

416
00:23:29,621 --> 00:23:31,388
The Conways knew our secret.

417
00:23:31,391 --> 00:23:35,460
And Mr. Conway blackmailed
my father, your Grandpappy.

418
00:23:35,462 --> 00:23:37,338
Them? The Conways knew our secret.

419
00:23:37,341 --> 00:23:40,700
- They were sinners, Betty.
- Even the children?

420
00:23:40,703 --> 00:23:42,667
Well, there was one survivor.

421
00:23:42,669 --> 00:23:44,235
The Conways' boy, Joseph.

422
00:23:44,237 --> 00:23:49,407
Mr. Svenson, who you convinced
to accuse an innocent man.

423
00:23:49,409 --> 00:23:52,577
Joseph was easy to man manipulate

424
00:23:52,579 --> 00:23:54,213
as a boy and as a man.

425
00:23:54,216 --> 00:23:56,908
What are you telling us? Hal, that...

426
00:23:56,911 --> 00:23:58,983
That I have a darkness, Alice.

427
00:23:58,985 --> 00:24:00,985
The same darkness my father had,

428
00:24:00,987 --> 00:24:03,588
the same darkness his father had.

429
00:24:04,624 --> 00:24:06,891
And now, it lives in Betty.

430
00:24:09,462 --> 00:24:11,095
Our daughter.

431
00:24:27,146 --> 00:24:28,913
Who am I, Betty?

432
00:24:30,149 --> 00:24:31,482
Say it.

433
00:24:33,386 --> 00:24:34,819
Say who I am!

434
00:24:40,126 --> 00:24:42,460
You're the Black Hood.

435
00:24:46,132 --> 00:24:47,732
That's right.

436
00:24:49,235 --> 00:24:50,735
Now say what I did.

437
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:56,481
You...

438
00:24:56,484 --> 00:24:58,854
shot Mr. Andrews.

439
00:24:58,857 --> 00:25:02,231
You killed Ms. Grundy,

440
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:05,825
the Sugarman, Midge, Dr. Masters...

441
00:25:07,921 --> 00:25:10,713
- But the debate...
- Was not me.

442
00:25:10,716 --> 00:25:13,184
I can't take credit for that.

443
00:25:15,461 --> 00:25:17,728
How's Veronica dealing with all this?

444
00:25:17,731 --> 00:25:19,964
Oh, she's in lock-down at the Pembrooke.

445
00:25:19,966 --> 00:25:22,767
For all of Mr. Lodge's
talk about law and order,

446
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:24,601
he was nowhere to be seen tonight.

447
00:25:24,604 --> 00:25:26,971
Well, I just went out
there to try to find you.

448
00:25:26,973 --> 00:25:28,573
I'm gonna take a shower.

449
00:25:28,575 --> 00:25:30,007
I'm gonna lock up.

450
00:26:31,887 --> 00:26:34,338
You okay?

451
00:26:34,341 --> 00:26:37,008
Thought about going
pro after high school.

452
00:26:38,311 --> 00:26:40,177
- Dad!
- What? Okay...

453
00:26:40,179 --> 00:26:41,812
No!

454
00:26:45,251 --> 00:26:48,052
Dad, Dad!

455
00:26:48,054 --> 00:26:50,223
I'm good.

456
00:26:50,226 --> 00:26:53,957
Tom Keller, he just put these
on before we went to the diner.

457
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,660
I'm good.

458
00:26:55,662 --> 00:26:57,294
Archie, no!

459
00:27:09,637 --> 00:27:12,283
Dad, why did you become the Black Hood?

460
00:27:12,286 --> 00:27:16,213
'Cause this is a town of sinners, Betty.

461
00:27:16,683 --> 00:27:18,783
And...

462
00:27:19,786 --> 00:27:21,552
Sinners have to die.

463
00:27:21,554 --> 00:27:23,654
Your speech at the Jubilee.

464
00:27:23,657 --> 00:27:26,524
Riverdale must do better.

465
00:27:26,526 --> 00:27:28,283
We must do better.

466
00:27:28,286 --> 00:27:31,996
You will do better. You must do better.

467
00:27:31,999 --> 00:27:35,650
Reminded me of a promise
that I'd made to my mother.

468
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:37,568
That this town will do better.

469
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:40,002
We must do better.

470
00:27:40,005 --> 00:27:42,473
So I picked up my father's sword,

471
00:27:42,476 --> 00:27:47,106
and I continued the work that
he and my grandfather started.

472
00:27:49,348 --> 00:27:51,082
The purging of sin.

473
00:27:51,084 --> 00:27:53,851
No, none of this makes any sense.

474
00:27:56,989 --> 00:27:59,173
Dad, why did you want
all of this recorded?

475
00:27:59,176 --> 00:28:02,960
I want everyone to
understand when they find us.

476
00:28:10,737 --> 00:28:12,369
Hi, Jones.

477
00:28:15,475 --> 00:28:18,075
Toni, are you okay?

478
00:28:18,078 --> 00:28:19,767
Jughead, she's not alone.

479
00:28:22,915 --> 00:28:24,482
Surprise!

480
00:28:27,325 --> 00:28:29,557
You said it was just
going to be the two of us.

481
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,463
I never go anywhere
without back-up any more,

482
00:28:31,466 --> 00:28:33,259
not after what you did to me.

483
00:28:33,262 --> 00:28:36,093
Besides, we need to talk,

484
00:28:36,863 --> 00:28:38,362
all of us...

485
00:28:38,365 --> 00:28:40,298
There's nothing to talk about.

486
00:28:40,967 --> 00:28:42,366
I'm taking Toni and we're leaving.

487
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:44,034
Not so fast!

488
00:28:44,037 --> 00:28:46,971
I've been waiting to see
you again for a long time.

489
00:28:48,307 --> 00:28:50,207
Get back, you hobgoblin!

490
00:28:52,844 --> 00:28:54,310
I brought back-up, too.

491
00:28:54,313 --> 00:28:58,048
Like I said, I'm taking
Toni, and we're leaving.

492
00:28:59,352 --> 00:29:02,286
Untie her, you Serpent hag.

493
00:29:04,357 --> 00:29:06,824
Take her, then.

494
00:29:08,294 --> 00:29:12,429
But remember, when all your friends
are dead, I tried giving you a chance.

495
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:21,041
Why do you keep coming
back? What do you want?

496
00:29:21,044 --> 00:29:22,406
The Southside.

497
00:29:22,409 --> 00:29:26,220
There's money to be made
here in "The Town With Pep,"

498
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:29,517
if you're not afraid of
getting your hands dirty.

499
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,550
So you're partnering with the Ghoulies
to sell drugs on the Southside?

500
00:29:32,552 --> 00:29:35,103
Bingo. So here's the offer

501
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,922
I want you to take back
to your dad and your tribe.

502
00:29:38,758 --> 00:29:40,457
The Serpents ship out tonight,

503
00:29:40,459 --> 00:29:43,594
or it's a showdown with the
Ghoulies at Pickens Park at dawn.

504
00:29:47,867 --> 00:29:49,533
I'm fine either way.

505
00:30:01,955 --> 00:30:04,922
Hello. I'm here to see Mr. Lodge.

506
00:30:07,186 --> 00:30:09,019
I'm sorry, he's not available.

507
00:30:10,091 --> 00:30:12,591
Are his lovely wife and
beautiful daughter at home?

508
00:30:15,561 --> 00:30:19,338
This is a game of nerves, Veronica,
and clearly, you've lost yours.

509
00:30:19,341 --> 00:30:21,994
I'd rather have lost
my nerve than my mind,

510
00:30:21,997 --> 00:30:24,435
which clearly, you and Daddy have.

511
00:30:24,438 --> 00:30:27,838
That "October Surprise" wouldn't
just destroy Fred's campaign,

512
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,975
it would ruin his life!

513
00:30:33,813 --> 00:30:35,614
Oh, God, who is it?

514
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:50,103
You may know my father. Goes
by the name Papa Poutine.

515
00:30:50,106 --> 00:30:53,130
He told me, if he was
ever to be murdered,

516
00:30:53,133 --> 00:30:55,833
not to take the life of
the man who killed him,

517
00:30:55,835 --> 00:30:59,294
but to take the lives of
those that man loved the most.

518
00:30:59,297 --> 00:31:01,895
- Mom...
- Mija, run. Run!

519
00:31:11,122 --> 00:31:13,823
Stay behind me!

520
00:31:38,176 --> 00:31:40,127
It's time we end the Ghoulie scourge

521
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:42,813
and that traitor, Penny
Peabody permanently.

522
00:31:42,815 --> 00:31:46,759
Sweet Pea, two hours ago your
fight was with Reggie Mantle.

523
00:31:46,762 --> 00:31:49,231
Now you want us to go
to war over territory

524
00:31:49,234 --> 00:31:51,466
that we don't even control anymore?

525
00:31:51,469 --> 00:31:53,470
This is Hiram Lodge's problem, not ours.

526
00:31:53,473 --> 00:31:55,960
So you're just gonna hand
over Sunnyside Trailer Park,

527
00:31:55,962 --> 00:31:58,205
our home to Penny and the Ghoulies?

528
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,397
Toni, I don't want us to die.

529
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,330
A rumble with the Ghoulies right now?

530
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:04,276
- It's a suicide-run.
- It's better than a coward's death.

531
00:32:04,278 --> 00:32:05,669
- Don't we have to defend ourselves?
- Calm yourself...

532
00:32:05,671 --> 00:32:06,937
That's enough!

533
00:32:10,109 --> 00:32:12,476
I just got a call from
the Sheriff's office.

534
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,746
Fangs, uh...

535
00:32:18,851 --> 00:32:20,951
He didn't make it. He's gone.

536
00:32:22,488 --> 00:32:23,721
Fangs is dead?

537
00:32:23,723 --> 00:32:25,622
And we will mourn him,
hell yeah, we will.

538
00:32:25,624 --> 00:32:28,192
But first, we will honor him.

539
00:32:29,255 --> 00:32:32,396
From what I just heard, it sounds
like we need to put it to a vote.

540
00:32:33,466 --> 00:32:37,301
All those against going
to war with the Ghoulies?

541
00:32:39,405 --> 00:32:42,806
And all those for giving them
hell on the battlefield tomorrow?

542
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:05,273
Well, Hal, I can't say I'm surprised.

543
00:33:05,276 --> 00:33:06,640
Mom?

544
00:33:06,643 --> 00:33:08,962
I always knew you were a Mama's boy.

545
00:33:08,965 --> 00:33:11,098
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

546
00:33:14,046 --> 00:33:18,539
I knew it. I knew you couldn't
do anything for yourself.

547
00:33:18,542 --> 00:33:21,051
Mom, whatever you're doing, I wouldn't.

548
00:33:21,054 --> 00:33:24,912
All I'm doing is I'm pointing out that
your father can't do anything right.

549
00:33:24,915 --> 00:33:27,085
Not even be a serial killer!

550
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:30,183
Cleansing the town of sin?

551
00:33:30,186 --> 00:33:33,521
Really, Hal, you're the damn sinner.

552
00:33:33,523 --> 00:33:34,722
Mom...

553
00:33:35,812 --> 00:33:38,859
What are you going to do, Hal? Are
you going to kill the entire town?

554
00:33:38,861 --> 00:33:43,194
Whoever's jaywalked? What did Fred
Andrews do to deserve to get shot?

555
00:33:43,197 --> 00:33:44,831
He was an adulterer.

556
00:33:44,834 --> 00:33:46,600
Oh, then why don't you kill yourself?

557
00:33:46,602 --> 00:33:48,736
You had a fling with Penelope Blossom.

558
00:33:48,738 --> 00:33:52,239
Or me, for that matter, since
I stepped out on you with FP,

559
00:33:52,241 --> 00:33:55,810
who, in every way that you're not...

560
00:33:56,646 --> 00:33:58,413
is a real man.

561
00:34:17,127 --> 00:34:18,692
This is a mistake.

562
00:34:20,703 --> 00:34:23,437
You can see that, right?

563
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,939
We'd be going in blind, Dad.

564
00:34:24,941 --> 00:34:27,208
Would you listen to me for two seconds?

565
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:32,379
For all we know, the Ghoulies
outnumber us one hundred to one...

566
00:34:32,382 --> 00:34:34,248
Don't you think I know that?

567
00:34:44,794 --> 00:34:47,795
Boy, I've been doing this
a lot longer than you have.

568
00:34:47,798 --> 00:34:49,330
And we voted.

569
00:34:50,101 --> 00:34:53,514
If we're going down,
we're going down fighting.

570
00:34:56,338 --> 00:35:00,444
As for being outnumbered,
I'll rally the reserves.

571
00:35:00,447 --> 00:35:02,011
They'll fight.

572
00:35:19,569 --> 00:35:23,070
- This is Hiram.
- Fangs getting arrested, the riot,

573
00:35:23,073 --> 00:35:27,167
the Ghoulies showing up the night
of the riot, with Penny in tow...

574
00:35:28,539 --> 00:35:30,624
None of this is happenstance.

575
00:35:30,627 --> 00:35:33,303
Jughead, I genuinely have no
idea what you're talking about.

576
00:35:33,306 --> 00:35:35,940
You've been buying up
everything you could.

577
00:35:35,943 --> 00:35:37,912
But you couldn't buy us,

578
00:35:39,549 --> 00:35:41,957
so you paid the Ghoulies

579
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:45,853
and Penny to go to war with the Serpents

580
00:35:45,856 --> 00:35:48,489
to finally get rid of
us once and for all.

581
00:35:49,492 --> 00:35:51,292
How much is this costing you?

582
00:35:51,295 --> 00:35:53,260
I'm hanging up now.

583
00:35:53,262 --> 00:35:54,828
'Cause I have a counter offer.

584
00:35:59,001 --> 00:36:00,334
Mr. Lodge?

585
00:36:02,805 --> 00:36:04,204
I'm listening.

586
00:36:15,338 --> 00:36:16,837
Andre?

587
00:36:30,025 --> 00:36:32,091
Veronica? Hermione?

588
00:36:34,437 --> 00:36:36,604
There's another dead body in the study.

589
00:36:38,027 --> 00:36:41,328
It's your mess, Daddy. You clean it up.

590
00:37:12,675 --> 00:37:14,544
It was him, Arch.

591
00:37:14,547 --> 00:37:16,777
My dad was the Black Hood.

592
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:22,149
How did you...

593
00:37:22,151 --> 00:37:24,918
Did you see him leave my house?
He tried to shoot my dad again.

594
00:37:24,921 --> 00:37:26,387
When?

595
00:37:26,389 --> 00:37:27,721
An hour ago.

596
00:37:27,723 --> 00:37:31,592
No, no, no. That's impossible,
he was here with us.

597
00:37:34,693 --> 00:37:36,497
- Jug?
- Betty...

598
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:40,067
I'm happy to hear your voice.

599
00:37:40,069 --> 00:37:42,536
Me, too, Jug. You have no idea.

600
00:37:42,539 --> 00:37:44,950
I just want to let you
know that I love you.

601
00:37:44,953 --> 00:37:46,456
And I'll never stop loving you.

602
00:37:46,459 --> 00:37:48,642
What are you saying, Jug? Where are you?

603
00:37:48,644 --> 00:37:50,794
- Where is he?
- I'll see you soon.

604
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:07,177
The Sacrificial Lamb arrives.

605
00:38:08,841 --> 00:38:13,010
I'll remind you of the deal that
I made with your boss, Hiram Lodge.

606
00:38:13,012 --> 00:38:16,677
I hand myself over to you tonight
and there's no bloodshed tomorrow.

607
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,808
Apparently, getting
you out of the picture

608
00:38:18,811 --> 00:38:22,012
is more important to him than
all-out Serpent annihilation.

609
00:38:23,589 --> 00:38:26,757
30-to-1. Are you that afraid of me?

610
00:38:29,962 --> 00:38:31,904
The only scary thing is what we're going

611
00:38:31,907 --> 00:38:34,159
to do to your girlfriend
when we find her.

612
00:38:43,109 --> 00:38:45,388
You're a true hero, Jughead.

613
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:50,865
Let your dying thought be that
your sacrifice was for nothing.

614
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:57,087
And that come morning, Riverdale
as you know it will cease to exist.

615
00:38:58,735 --> 00:39:00,902
Don't finish him off yet, guys.

616
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:04,327
I want my pound of flesh first.

617
00:39:09,699 --> 00:39:11,265
Betty, are you and your mom okay?

618
00:39:11,268 --> 00:39:13,080
Mr. Jones, is Jughead with you?

619
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:15,706
- No, he's at the trailer. Why?
- I'm just really worried about him.

620
00:39:15,708 --> 00:39:17,833
He called to say how much he loves me

621
00:39:17,836 --> 00:39:21,738
and it almost sounded like he
was saying goodbye for good.

622
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:26,029
Toni, where was Penny hiding out?

623
00:39:36,028 --> 00:39:37,260
Jug!

624
00:39:44,414 --> 00:39:46,881
Sheriff Minetta delivered the
bodies to the coroner's office,

625
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,795
tagged them as riot victims, so no one's

626
00:39:48,798 --> 00:39:50,521
going to be asking us any questions.

627
00:39:56,348 --> 00:39:58,471
I am so sorry.

628
00:39:58,474 --> 00:40:01,218
I just thank God that
neither of you were hurt.

629
00:40:05,524 --> 00:40:07,896
I found your October Surprise file.

630
00:40:10,662 --> 00:40:14,721
Well, your mother understands
the costs of winning.

631
00:40:14,724 --> 00:40:18,468
Better than almost anyone.
Isn't that right, mi amor?

632
00:40:18,471 --> 00:40:20,356
I realized something.

633
00:40:21,591 --> 00:40:25,825
There will always be an
October surprise with you.

634
00:40:25,828 --> 00:40:28,361
And another and another.

635
00:40:30,549 --> 00:40:34,643
But while Mom may volunteer
to be your collateral damage,

636
00:40:34,646 --> 00:40:37,908
- I won't.
- What'd I always teach you?

637
00:40:37,911 --> 00:40:40,208
Never lose sight of the bigger picture.

638
00:40:41,479 --> 00:40:44,913
I'm not the one who's lost sight, Daddy.

639
00:41:01,472 --> 00:41:04,540
- Where is he? Where's Jug?
- Guys...

640
00:41:40,226 --> 00:41:43,539
