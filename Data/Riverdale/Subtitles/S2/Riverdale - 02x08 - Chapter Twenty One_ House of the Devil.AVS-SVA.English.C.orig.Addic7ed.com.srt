1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,734
Previously on Riverdale...

2
00:00:03,492 --> 00:00:04,932
This is the Black Hood.

3
00:00:04,935 --> 00:00:07,093
I wanted to cleanse the
Riverdale of sinners.

4
00:00:07,095 --> 00:00:08,395
No.

5
00:00:09,765 --> 00:00:11,965
Mr. Svenson... you scared me.

6
00:00:12,968 --> 00:00:14,167
I mean, really? Mom?

7
00:00:14,169 --> 00:00:15,769
You talked trash about the Serpents

8
00:00:15,771 --> 00:00:17,337
when you yourself were one?

9
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:18,835
FP had a little accident.

10
00:00:18,838 --> 00:00:19,773
What can we do?

11
00:00:19,776 --> 00:00:21,308
Just pick up a crate on the Southside,

12
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,143
deliver it to an address in Greendale.

13
00:00:23,145 --> 00:00:26,046
You do not want to be in
bed with a snake charmer.

14
00:00:26,048 --> 00:00:28,062
And if Penny Peabody reaches out,

15
00:00:28,065 --> 00:00:28,984
don't respond.

16
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:31,176
No. You said that this was
going to be a one and done.

17
00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:33,154
And I am just getting started with you.

18
00:00:33,157 --> 00:00:35,221
You think the Riverdale
Reaper is the Black Hood?

19
00:00:35,223 --> 00:00:38,959
I wouldn't be surprised
if it was the same man.

20
00:00:38,962 --> 00:00:41,809
There was a family living
out near Fox Forest.

21
00:00:41,812 --> 00:00:44,197
Someone broke in and shot 'em all dead.

22
00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:47,234
Some say he never left Riverdale.

23
00:00:48,604 --> 00:00:52,539
Like the Red Death showing up
in an Edgar Allan Poe story,

24
00:00:52,542 --> 00:00:55,008
the Black Hood had come to Riverdale.

25
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:57,877
With that grimmest of
reapers looming over us,

26
00:00:57,879 --> 00:00:59,546
how did we cope?

27
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:02,565
In the case of Archie and Veronica,

28
00:01:02,568 --> 00:01:04,851
it was through carnal defiance.

29
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,188
Ugh! Get a room, Xenomorphs!

30
00:01:08,191 --> 00:01:10,223
With every kiss and embrace,

31
00:01:10,225 --> 00:01:11,604
they seemed to be saying:

32
00:01:11,607 --> 00:01:14,160
"You have no power over me, Death."

33
00:01:15,297 --> 00:01:18,966
In fact, "Varchie" became
the opposite of death.

34
00:01:21,203 --> 00:01:23,044
In Archie's bedroom...

35
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:29,794
In his garage...

36
00:01:38,787 --> 00:01:40,587
Even in the Pembrooke.

37
00:01:40,589 --> 00:01:44,494
After all, if our young lovers
dared to defy the Black Hood,

38
00:01:44,497 --> 00:01:47,861
why not risk Hiram
Lodge's wrath as well?

39
00:01:50,165 --> 00:01:52,465
- Hey.
- Hmm.

40
00:01:52,468 --> 00:01:54,835
Are you sure your parents aren't
gonna come back any time soon?

41
00:01:54,837 --> 00:01:56,504
What if they catch us like this?

42
00:01:56,507 --> 00:02:00,940
The tasting menu at Pourquoi
is 13 courses, Archie.

43
00:02:00,942 --> 00:02:03,052
We have hours yet.

44
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,312
What?

45
00:02:06,315 --> 00:02:09,883
You've always wanted to make
it in front of a roaring fire?

46
00:02:11,053 --> 00:02:13,920
No, just... I love you, Ronnie.

47
00:02:19,261 --> 00:02:21,594
- You, uh, wanna watch Netflix?
- I wonder what's on HBO.

48
00:02:21,596 --> 00:02:23,563
Maybe I should go on the off
chance your parents come back.

49
00:02:23,565 --> 00:02:25,325
Yeah, or at a minimum,
we should get dressed.

50
00:02:27,302 --> 00:02:29,569
I'm gonna go... I have to do this thing.

51
00:02:29,571 --> 00:02:30,970
I'll text you.

52
00:02:30,972 --> 00:02:32,729
Archie...

53
00:02:32,732 --> 00:02:36,009
this was as always, amazing.

54
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:52,302
Sorry, there's no service
in the bowels of City Hall.

55
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:53,161
What'd you find?

56
00:02:53,164 --> 00:02:54,858
Any truth to what that creepy truck

57
00:02:54,861 --> 00:02:56,742
driver said about that murdered family?

58
00:02:56,745 --> 00:02:59,933
Yes, shockingly, Freddy
Krueger didn't lie to me.

59
00:02:59,936 --> 00:03:01,801
A family of four was murdered

60
00:03:01,803 --> 00:03:04,137
by someone that the press
called "the Riverdale Reaper."

61
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,041
The victims were Jim and Mary
Ellen Conway and their kids.

62
00:03:08,043 --> 00:03:10,243
Tommy was ten, and Sue was nine.

63
00:03:10,245 --> 00:03:12,145
Reaper was never caught or identified,

64
00:03:12,147 --> 00:03:13,379
so he could be our Black Hood,

65
00:03:13,381 --> 00:03:15,849
but I'm dubious. He would
be in his 60's by now.

66
00:03:15,851 --> 00:03:18,318
Why did he do it... Kill them?

67
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,087
The reporter of the article
talked to a sheriff at the time

68
00:03:21,089 --> 00:03:23,556
who thought... Killer
chose them at random

69
00:03:23,558 --> 00:03:26,164
- or because their house was isolated.
- Where was it?

70
00:03:26,167 --> 00:03:28,585
Edge of Fox Forest,
down some service road.

71
00:03:28,588 --> 00:03:30,187
There's a picture of it.

72
00:03:36,838 --> 00:03:38,731
Oh, my God.

73
00:03:38,734 --> 00:03:41,641
Jughead, I've been to this house.

74
00:03:41,643 --> 00:03:45,178
The Black Hood sent me to
it, as part of his game.

75
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,248
Well, then there's definitely a
link between the Hood and the Reaper.

76
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,315
We should talk to Keller.

77
00:03:49,317 --> 00:03:50,450
Pull the files from the murders.

78
00:03:50,452 --> 00:03:52,252
At least get a list of all the players.

79
00:03:52,254 --> 00:03:54,154
No, Jughead, I can't
go to Sheriff Keller.

80
00:03:54,156 --> 00:03:57,148
Not after I accused him
of being the Black Hood.

81
00:03:57,151 --> 00:03:59,993
Right, yeah, that would be awkward.

82
00:03:59,996 --> 00:04:02,061
You could go to the house.

83
00:04:02,063 --> 00:04:04,464
I can't go back there, Jug.

84
00:04:04,467 --> 00:04:06,671
He made me look in a mirror,

85
00:04:06,674 --> 00:04:08,671
you know, what I saw
staring back at me...

86
00:04:08,674 --> 00:04:10,670
I don't want to do that again.

87
00:04:10,672 --> 00:04:13,117
Then you don't have to, okay?

88
00:04:23,752 --> 00:04:24,951
Hello?

89
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,689
Yeah, I'll accept the charges.

90
00:04:29,691 --> 00:04:32,258
So the reason we called
you guys in here...

91
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,060
My dad's getting out of jail.

92
00:04:35,063 --> 00:04:36,729
Jug, that's... That's great.

93
00:04:36,732 --> 00:04:40,066
Yeah, what heralded this miracle?

94
00:04:41,736 --> 00:04:44,103
Uh, overcrowding at the jail,

95
00:04:44,105 --> 00:04:46,306
I guess the judge reviewed my dad's case

96
00:04:46,308 --> 00:04:49,042
and after Cheryl's testimony it was...

97
00:04:49,044 --> 00:04:50,276
A perfect storm.

98
00:04:50,278 --> 00:04:51,578
What do you need from us, Jug?

99
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,981
Both of us. We have a new
lead on the Black Hood case.

100
00:04:54,983 --> 00:04:56,382
And Jughead and I, we were wondering

101
00:04:56,384 --> 00:04:58,554
if you guys would
follow up on it for us.

102
00:04:58,557 --> 00:05:02,655
We can give you all of
the details, the articles.

103
00:05:02,658 --> 00:05:04,891
It's just that I have
to be there for my dad

104
00:05:04,893 --> 00:05:06,459
to help with his re-entry, so.

105
00:05:06,461 --> 00:05:07,493
Uh, yeah and I'm just...

106
00:05:07,495 --> 00:05:09,762
I'm taking a break from the Black Hood.

107
00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:13,032
Wait, so,

108
00:05:13,034 --> 00:05:15,735
you want us to be

109
00:05:15,737 --> 00:05:16,804
you guys?

110
00:05:16,807 --> 00:05:18,338
Essentially, yes.

111
00:05:20,809 --> 00:05:22,408
Why, is there a problem with that?

112
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:30,583
Oh, my God, Josie, your back,

113
00:05:30,586 --> 00:05:32,819
it's like a sailor's rope!

114
00:05:32,821 --> 00:05:34,765
- What?
- All these tension knots.

115
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:36,003
Luckily, I just picked up

116
00:05:36,006 --> 00:05:38,457
a new bottle of lavender essential oil.

117
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,525
Turn around.

118
00:05:39,528 --> 00:05:41,476
Uh, okay.

119
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:50,536
Girls, I'm so sorry, I didn't
know anyone was still in here

120
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:52,238
No, It's okay, Mr. Svenson,

121
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,641
Oh, my God, Josie. It's so not okay.

122
00:05:54,644 --> 00:05:56,509
Take your male gaze
and your male privilege

123
00:05:56,511 --> 00:05:58,378
and get out of the women's locker room!

124
00:05:58,381 --> 00:06:01,147
Of course, my apologies.
I should've knocked.

125
00:06:01,149 --> 00:06:02,615
Can you believe that?

126
00:06:02,617 --> 00:06:04,906
He should be fired and investigated,

127
00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:06,853
the peeping Tom.

128
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:19,986
- Sheriff Keller.
- Veronica.

129
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,003
What was he doing here?

130
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,275
The shadow of the Black Hood
has finally landed on our home.

131
00:06:29,277 --> 00:06:30,977
We received a letter.

132
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:32,578
What? What did it say?

133
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,880
The usual.

134
00:06:33,882 --> 00:06:36,716
That we'll be targeted and
punished for our sinful ways.

135
00:06:37,485 --> 00:06:39,452
Well, don't let it ruin your day.

136
00:06:39,454 --> 00:06:42,221
According to Keller,
apparently dozens of households

137
00:06:42,223 --> 00:06:43,990
received the exact same letter.

138
00:06:43,992 --> 00:06:45,725
Well, I don't know
about those other people,

139
00:06:45,727 --> 00:06:47,760
but we're actually sinners.

140
00:06:48,596 --> 00:06:50,396
The Pembrooke is a fortress

141
00:06:50,398 --> 00:06:52,765
and Andre is trained
in the martial arts.

142
00:06:52,767 --> 00:06:54,300
What about when I go to school?

143
00:06:54,302 --> 00:06:56,069
- Or shopping?
- He'll drive you,

144
00:06:56,071 --> 00:06:58,504
and if he's not available,
we'll hire a car service.

145
00:06:58,507 --> 00:07:00,840
Also, your father and I have talked

146
00:07:00,842 --> 00:07:03,515
and we wouldn't mind
seeing more of Archie.

147
00:07:03,518 --> 00:07:06,253
He's brawny and devoted to you.

148
00:07:22,897 --> 00:07:24,397
Wait, uh, Mom,

149
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,719
before you leave, I wanted to ask

150
00:07:25,722 --> 00:07:27,834
if I could borrow the
station wagon tomorrow?

151
00:07:27,836 --> 00:07:29,200
Why?

152
00:07:29,203 --> 00:07:31,523
FP's getting released from jail.

153
00:07:31,526 --> 00:07:32,531
So, Jughead and I,

154
00:07:32,534 --> 00:07:34,585
we're gonna pick him up
and treat him to Pop's.

155
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:36,009
They're letting FP out?

156
00:07:36,011 --> 00:07:37,343
And you're gonna hear it eventually,

157
00:07:37,345 --> 00:07:39,012
so, it might as well be from me.

158
00:07:39,015 --> 00:07:41,180
Don't freak out,

159
00:07:41,183 --> 00:07:43,929
Jughead is a Serpent now, officially.

160
00:07:43,932 --> 00:07:45,385
Betty...

161
00:07:45,388 --> 00:07:48,121
I wish I could say I was surprised.

162
00:07:48,123 --> 00:07:49,789
Jughead is important to me.

163
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,499
FP is important to Jughead.

164
00:07:51,502 --> 00:07:53,725
So I'm asking, Mom,

165
00:07:53,728 --> 00:07:56,462
will you try to give him
the benefit of the doubt,

166
00:07:56,464 --> 00:07:57,764
for me?

167
00:07:58,733 --> 00:08:00,960
I have an announcement to make.

168
00:08:00,963 --> 00:08:02,268
My dad's getting out.

169
00:08:04,706 --> 00:08:05,972
And when he does,

170
00:08:05,974 --> 00:08:07,240
I'll bring him up to speed

171
00:08:07,242 --> 00:08:09,042
about our plans with Mayor McCoy.

172
00:08:09,045 --> 00:08:10,835
That's brilliant.

173
00:08:10,838 --> 00:08:13,359
Do you have a problem
with that, Tall Boy?

174
00:08:13,362 --> 00:08:15,718
Your old man? No.

175
00:08:16,951 --> 00:08:18,918
I got no problem with him.

176
00:08:18,921 --> 00:08:21,354
But you want us to sit
down with the Mayor.

177
00:08:21,356 --> 00:08:23,489
I do. He's right.

178
00:08:24,526 --> 00:08:26,325
I think we can bring the Southside back.

179
00:08:26,327 --> 00:08:29,962
But it's going to take work and
it's going to take compromise.

180
00:08:29,965 --> 00:08:32,296
Bring the Southside back.

181
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:34,399
You've been here all of five minutes.

182
00:08:34,402 --> 00:08:37,770
Tall Boy, I am sick of you
acting like a little bitch.

183
00:08:37,772 --> 00:08:40,573
Whispering behind my back
that I'm half a Serpent

184
00:08:40,575 --> 00:08:42,208
or that I don't belong here.

185
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:43,576
Why don't we put it to a vote?

186
00:08:43,578 --> 00:08:45,478
If you guys think what
I'm doing is wrong,

187
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,846
I'll step aside.

188
00:08:46,849 --> 00:08:49,082
All those who stand with Jughead

189
00:08:49,084 --> 00:08:51,751
and think that Tall Boy
should shut the hell up...

190
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:07,700
- My parents are in their room.
- Good.

191
00:09:17,545 --> 00:09:19,779
That thing Betty and
Jughead asked us to do,

192
00:09:19,781 --> 00:09:21,247
investigate the murder house,

193
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,516
- I wanna do it.
- Yeah, me too.

194
00:09:24,853 --> 00:09:26,719
My parents got a threatening letter.

195
00:09:26,722 --> 00:09:28,367
- What? From the Black Hood?
- Maybe,

196
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:31,257
or maybe it's was somebody
pretending to be the Black Hood.

197
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:32,925
- Ronnie...
- Mmm.

198
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,924
Are we good?

199
00:09:36,927 --> 00:09:38,293
Don't stop, Archie.

200
00:09:39,249 --> 00:09:40,757
I don't want to.

201
00:09:43,037 --> 00:09:44,704
Can we talk about what I said?

202
00:09:44,706 --> 00:09:46,437
Archie,

203
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,906
I wanna be with you,

204
00:09:47,909 --> 00:09:48,941
and you want to be with me.

205
00:09:48,943 --> 00:09:50,943
Can't that be enough for right now?

206
00:09:50,946 --> 00:09:52,812
While we focus on the case?

207
00:10:01,971 --> 00:10:05,304
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

208
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,844
What's wrong, Archie? Something
you wanna get off your chest?

209
00:10:09,847 --> 00:10:11,508
Yeah, actually.

210
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,464
Me and Ronnie are in
kind of a weird place.

211
00:10:16,466 --> 00:10:18,132
Things have been pretty intense lately

212
00:10:18,134 --> 00:10:21,402
Something weird happened with Archie.

213
00:10:21,404 --> 00:10:22,436
Well, to be honest,

214
00:10:22,438 --> 00:10:25,072
I'm not sure if it even
really happened, but...

215
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,509
He may or may not have

216
00:10:28,511 --> 00:10:30,544
said the "L" word to me.

217
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:33,180
I said "I love you" to her, Dad.

218
00:10:33,182 --> 00:10:35,549
And she didn't say it back.

219
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:37,084
And yes, she heard me.

220
00:10:37,087 --> 00:10:40,254
Which, if he did, I think it's...

221
00:10:40,257 --> 00:10:43,057
Too soon, don't you guys agree?

222
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,527
I wouldn't get too in
your head about that, son.

223
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:47,595
I mean, those three words,

224
00:10:47,597 --> 00:10:49,765
people are often on different schedules.

225
00:10:49,768 --> 00:10:51,499
It doesn't matter what Archie said.

226
00:10:51,501 --> 00:10:53,801
Or didn't say, that's my preference.

227
00:10:53,804 --> 00:10:56,764
It's about whether or not
you're ready to hear it.

228
00:11:11,621 --> 00:11:13,187
Ah!

229
00:11:15,024 --> 00:11:16,791
- Hey, Betty.
- Hi, Mr. Jones.

230
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,726
Alice!

231
00:11:18,728 --> 00:11:20,094
Is it true what they say about men

232
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,962
who have just been
released from prison, FP?

233
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,664
What do they say?

234
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:26,086
That they're incredibly
sexually frustrated.

235
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:27,635
- Mom! What?
- Wow.

236
00:11:36,795 --> 00:11:38,328
Seat belts, Betty.

237
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,753
The Black Hood is targeting sinners,

238
00:11:45,755 --> 00:11:48,289
so, I'd watch my back if I were you, FP,

239
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:51,344
especially once you re-join
that gang of hoodlums.

240
00:11:51,347 --> 00:11:52,297
The Serpents aren't...

241
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,981
I'm not going back to
the Serpents, Alice.

242
00:11:54,984 --> 00:11:57,598
I thought a lot about this
while I was in Shankshaw,

243
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,400
and I'm done with Serpent life.

244
00:11:59,403 --> 00:12:01,602
It's gonna be one last
ride for my boy and I.

245
00:12:01,604 --> 00:12:04,238
But it's too much of a
slippery slope for me.

246
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,907
- The Serpents need you, Dad.
- Jughead needs you, Mr. Jones.

247
00:12:06,909 --> 00:12:08,442
And what, pray tell, will you be doing

248
00:12:08,444 --> 00:12:10,945
with all of your extra time, FP?

249
00:12:10,947 --> 00:12:12,813
Working, Warden Cooper.

250
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:14,949
Saw a "Help Wanted" sign in the window.

251
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:17,251
Thought I'd talk to Pop
about picking up some shifts.

252
00:12:17,253 --> 00:12:19,487
Let's hope your plans
don't come crashing down

253
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,039
once you start drinking again.

254
00:12:21,042 --> 00:12:22,562
Actually, I'm in AA.

255
00:12:23,336 --> 00:12:25,860
Started in jail and I
don't plan on stopping.

256
00:12:25,862 --> 00:12:27,128
Mmm.

257
00:12:30,767 --> 00:12:33,801
- Sheriff.
- We wanted to talk to you about a cold case.

258
00:12:33,803 --> 00:12:36,137
About a family that was
murdered in Fox Forest

259
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:37,172
40 years ago.

260
00:12:37,175 --> 00:12:39,940
Your receptionist said that the
files on the case were missing.

261
00:12:39,942 --> 00:12:41,342
Is it possible they were stolen?

262
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:42,443
As part of a cover-up?

263
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:45,745
Now, now, hold on.
Sometimes with cold cases,

264
00:12:45,748 --> 00:12:47,815
the lead officer will
take the files home,

265
00:12:47,817 --> 00:12:49,057
so he can keep working on them.

266
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,601
Who would have been the
lead officer on this case?

267
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,404
Back then? Multiple homicide?

268
00:12:53,407 --> 00:12:55,389
My guess would be Sheriff Howard.

269
00:12:55,391 --> 00:12:56,423
Do you know where he is?

270
00:12:56,425 --> 00:12:59,093
Sheriff Howard died two years ago, now.

271
00:12:59,096 --> 00:13:01,515
But his daughter, still
lives in town here, Margaret.

272
00:13:01,518 --> 00:13:02,696
Get her contact information.

273
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,031
Maybe she can help.

274
00:13:04,634 --> 00:13:06,400
My name is Veronica Lodge.

275
00:13:06,402 --> 00:13:09,136
I'm calling about one
of your father's cases,

276
00:13:09,138 --> 00:13:10,538
the Conway murders?

277
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,873
Here we go again. What about 'em?

278
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:15,984
My colleague and I are writing
a retrospective on the murders,

279
00:13:15,987 --> 00:13:17,411
and we were wondering if...

280
00:13:17,413 --> 00:13:19,466
My dad was obsessed with the killings.

281
00:13:19,469 --> 00:13:22,082
He called the house where they
happened the Devil's house.

282
00:13:22,085 --> 00:13:24,218
He'd go to that place
day and night for hours,

283
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,787
trying to put the pieces together.

284
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,789
If you ask me, my father
lost his mind in that house.

285
00:13:29,792 --> 00:13:31,419
Now, I am done talking about this, okay?

286
00:13:31,422 --> 00:13:32,560
Don't call me again.

287
00:13:34,931 --> 00:13:36,531
- Ronnie...
- Don't say it, Archie.

288
00:13:36,534 --> 00:13:37,698
We have to go to that house.

289
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,033
The Devil's house.

290
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,102
What if he's home?

291
00:14:12,668 --> 00:14:14,973
Things got ugly when you were away.

292
00:14:14,976 --> 00:14:17,738
I asked myself every
day what you would do,

293
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,906
if you were here.

294
00:14:19,876 --> 00:14:21,719
Has Penny bothered you?

295
00:14:21,722 --> 00:14:24,278
Figured she's the one
who greased my wheels.

296
00:14:25,715 --> 00:14:27,181
I did a job for her.

297
00:14:27,183 --> 00:14:28,515
What kind of job?

298
00:14:28,517 --> 00:14:30,575
It's a one-time thing.

299
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,887
Figured it best not to
ask too many questions.

300
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,423
We're squared away. For good.

301
00:14:38,394 --> 00:14:40,239
You know, when I was 16,

302
00:14:40,242 --> 00:14:43,130
my old man kicked me out
and told me to go to hell.

303
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:45,933
Instead, I joined the Serpents.

304
00:14:45,936 --> 00:14:48,573
And then the army, and then back again.

305
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:52,288
I don't want that life for you, Jug.

306
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,919
I want you to go to college,

307
00:14:53,922 --> 00:14:56,180
get out of this godforsaken town.

308
00:14:56,183 --> 00:14:57,916
I ran the gauntlet.

309
00:14:57,919 --> 00:14:59,914
I fought with the Serpents.

310
00:14:59,917 --> 00:15:02,483
And fod them, I have to stay.

311
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:05,986
I wanna stay.

312
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:08,789
And I need your blessing.

313
00:15:12,728 --> 00:15:14,664
Just promise me you'll keep writing.

314
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:15,696
I will.

315
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,132
I do every day.

316
00:15:36,514 --> 00:15:38,116
Y'all finished?

317
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:39,585
Yeah, thanks, Dad.

318
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,536
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

319
00:15:43,305 --> 00:15:44,504
- Josie.
- Yeah.

320
00:15:44,506 --> 00:15:46,306
Playing a car dealership opening

321
00:15:46,308 --> 00:15:48,442
is barely a step above amateur porn.

322
00:15:48,444 --> 00:15:50,077
Reggie's texting me that his dad

323
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,714
is gonna pay me $5,000

324
00:15:52,717 --> 00:15:54,281
for five songs.

325
00:15:54,283 --> 00:15:56,717
As long as he gets to escort me.

326
00:16:05,394 --> 00:16:07,094
Clean that up, Plebe.

327
00:16:07,097 --> 00:16:09,330
The way you did my brother's blood.

328
00:16:10,766 --> 00:16:12,399
Jug, don't.

329
00:16:16,405 --> 00:16:18,244
We'll get you another
milkshake right away.

330
00:16:18,247 --> 00:16:19,446
On the house.

331
00:16:29,652 --> 00:16:30,951
My dad used to be a king.

332
00:16:30,953 --> 00:16:32,219
A leader of men.

333
00:16:32,221 --> 00:16:34,921
Now he's being demeaned by
the likes of Cheryl Blossom.

334
00:16:35,891 --> 00:16:38,761
He deserves to be
honored, not humiliated.

335
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:41,595
So, why don't we do just that?

336
00:16:41,598 --> 00:16:43,664
Seriously, why not throw your dad

337
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:46,733
a retirement party fit for a king?

338
00:16:47,514 --> 00:16:49,180
Don't worry, I'll take
care of everything.

339
00:16:52,241 --> 00:16:53,774
You have a stage.

340
00:16:53,777 --> 00:16:56,276
Would you be open to me
bringing in a karaoke machine?

341
00:16:56,278 --> 00:16:58,478
For FP's retirement?

342
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,780
Sure, why not.

343
00:16:59,782 --> 00:17:02,516
Also, Toni, one of the reasons
I wanted to talk to you,

344
00:17:02,518 --> 00:17:04,651
beyond the party-planning, is...

345
00:17:05,245 --> 00:17:07,379
I've been walking the razor's edge

346
00:17:07,382 --> 00:17:09,022
since Jughead joined the Serpents

347
00:17:09,024 --> 00:17:10,925
and all I've been thinking is...

348
00:17:10,928 --> 00:17:12,793
You know, as soon as FP gets home,

349
00:17:12,795 --> 00:17:13,927
everything will get better

350
00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:16,096
because he'll be there
to protect Jughead

351
00:17:16,098 --> 00:17:17,864
and make sure he doesn't get hurt.

352
00:17:17,866 --> 00:17:18,965
Yeah, I'm following you.

353
00:17:18,967 --> 00:17:20,400
I mean, with FP out of the picture...

354
00:17:20,402 --> 00:17:22,035
But that's my whole point.

355
00:17:22,037 --> 00:17:23,704
I do worry.

356
00:17:24,606 --> 00:17:27,952
So, I wanna keep an eye on Jughead,

357
00:17:27,955 --> 00:17:29,137
myself.

358
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:34,285
Make sure that as deep into these
snake-infested waters as he goes,

359
00:17:34,288 --> 00:17:38,436
he doesn't do something that...
you know, puts him in danger.

360
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:39,960
So, what?

361
00:17:39,963 --> 00:17:41,530
You wanna be a Serpent?

362
00:17:43,492 --> 00:17:46,159
Let's say Serpent-adjacent.

363
00:17:46,162 --> 00:17:50,964
But, yeah, part of
his world, this world.

364
00:17:52,892 --> 00:17:54,672
Shut it, Byrdie.

365
00:17:54,675 --> 00:17:56,603
Sorry, Sweet Valley High,

366
00:17:56,605 --> 00:18:00,147
if you wanna join the club,
you gotta do the dance...

367
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,508
Serpent dance.

368
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,510
Excuse me, Serpent dance?

369
00:18:03,512 --> 00:18:06,146
It's an outdated,
sexist Serpent tradition.

370
00:18:06,148 --> 00:18:09,383
Tried to get it outlawed,
but misogyny dies hard.

371
00:18:10,749 --> 00:18:12,786
You don't wanna know.

372
00:18:12,788 --> 00:18:15,061
Uh, yeah, I do.

373
00:18:16,592 --> 00:18:18,191
I wanna know everything.

374
00:18:25,634 --> 00:18:28,514
A party? No, no, no, no.

375
00:18:28,517 --> 00:18:30,971
The problem is, I'm
trying to keep the Serpents

376
00:18:30,974 --> 00:18:32,739
in my rear view mirror, remember?

377
00:18:32,741 --> 00:18:35,702
It's one night. Not even,
it's like three hours.

378
00:18:36,861 --> 00:18:38,278
You've done right by the Serpents,

379
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,447
more than right. Why
can't they do right by you?

380
00:18:42,317 --> 00:18:44,618
Come on, it's the end of an era.

381
00:18:46,555 --> 00:18:47,921
Okay.

382
00:18:47,924 --> 00:18:50,090
- Okay, let's do it.
- Great.

383
00:18:52,408 --> 00:18:53,864
It's Archie.

384
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:56,463
Don't bogart the egg rolls.

385
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:58,996
What the hell do you want, Penny?

386
00:18:58,999 --> 00:19:00,333
We have business.

387
00:19:00,335 --> 00:19:01,868
How fast can you get to Pop's?

388
00:19:01,871 --> 00:19:03,937
No. No, I told you that I'm out.

389
00:19:03,939 --> 00:19:04,819
That I'm done.

390
00:19:04,822 --> 00:19:06,139
Don't keep me waiting
long, little doggie,

391
00:19:06,141 --> 00:19:07,874
or I'll have your
father back behind bars

392
00:19:07,876 --> 00:19:09,743
before I finish my cup of burnt coffee.

393
00:19:12,314 --> 00:19:14,448
I won't be held hostage by you.

394
00:19:14,451 --> 00:19:16,014
I did my one favor, I'm out.

395
00:19:16,017 --> 00:19:19,007
No, no, you have debts to pay.

396
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:21,585
And ours is an ongoing arrangement.

397
00:19:21,588 --> 00:19:22,821
You know what, Penny?

398
00:19:23,694 --> 00:19:26,026
I'm about to have a
sit-down with Mayor McCoy.

399
00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:28,428
She's not really so big on
the whole drug dealing thing

400
00:19:28,431 --> 00:19:29,996
and I'm sure that she would love to know

401
00:19:29,998 --> 00:19:31,898
who took over Clifford
Blossom's operation.

402
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,969
You'd need proof to make an
accusation like that stick.

403
00:19:35,972 --> 00:19:37,804
Like the video I have
of you and your pal

404
00:19:37,806 --> 00:19:38,939
making that delivery for me.

405
00:19:38,941 --> 00:19:40,207
What do you think of that?

406
00:19:40,209 --> 00:19:43,477
I think that an attack
against me, or my father,

407
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,522
is an attack against
all of the Serpents.

408
00:19:46,525 --> 00:19:49,182
And not even some fuzzy
surveillance footage

409
00:19:49,184 --> 00:19:50,417
of me delivering a crate

410
00:19:50,419 --> 00:19:52,819
is going to stop us from coming for you.

411
00:19:54,723 --> 00:19:55,989
Your girlfriend...

412
00:19:57,241 --> 00:19:59,975
Betty Cooper, I believe?

413
00:20:01,528 --> 00:20:03,462
She's quite fetching.

414
00:20:07,135 --> 00:20:08,168
What did you say?

415
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:11,171
All snakes have a soft underbelly.

416
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,859
She's yours, am I right?

417
00:20:23,118 --> 00:20:26,402
Now I'm regretting throwing
your gun in Sweetwater River.

418
00:20:26,405 --> 00:20:29,189
Sheriff Howard kept coming
back here year after year,

419
00:20:29,191 --> 00:20:30,857
there must be a reason why.

420
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,360
Something that didn't,
or doesn't add up.

421
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:37,130
So, what does the article say happened?

422
00:20:37,133 --> 00:20:39,293
The Reaper came at night,

423
00:20:39,296 --> 00:20:42,208
when the rest of the town
was getting ready for bed.

424
00:20:53,615 --> 00:20:57,851
He killed the mother,
Mary Ellen Conway, first.

425
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:01,675
Maybe over there.

426
00:21:19,975 --> 00:21:22,542
He killed the father, Jim
Conway, in the kitchen.

427
00:21:26,515 --> 00:21:28,548
He was rushing to save his wife.

428
00:21:33,288 --> 00:21:35,589
He was shot point-blank in the chest.

429
00:21:35,592 --> 00:21:38,458
The kids were still in their bedrooms.

430
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,460
Hiding.

431
00:21:40,462 --> 00:21:42,295
My God, Archie.

432
00:21:51,622 --> 00:21:53,399
They were hiding under the bed.

433
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,350
Archie? It was a family of
four that was killed, right?

434
00:22:22,353 --> 00:22:23,436
Yeah, why?

435
00:22:23,438 --> 00:22:24,871
There's something weird here...

436
00:22:24,873 --> 00:22:26,405
Three sets of initials.

437
00:22:39,888 --> 00:22:42,889
These are Sheriff
Howard's files, his notes.

438
00:22:42,891 --> 00:22:45,692
He kept them here so he could
keep working on the case.

439
00:22:45,695 --> 00:22:49,029
Does it say anything
about a third child?

440
00:22:49,032 --> 00:22:51,164
With the letters "J" and "C"?

441
00:22:52,692 --> 00:22:53,925
Wait, wait, turn it back.

442
00:22:56,972 --> 00:22:58,872
Oh, my God, Archie, there.

443
00:23:00,108 --> 00:23:02,842
The Conways were a family of five.

444
00:23:09,191 --> 00:23:10,418
Why so sad?

445
00:23:10,421 --> 00:23:12,492
It's great news about your dad.

446
00:23:14,213 --> 00:23:17,114
I guess that means the
Snake Charmer came through.

447
00:23:18,334 --> 00:23:22,070
What? She hasn't called you for
any more favors again, has she?

448
00:23:22,073 --> 00:23:23,503
That deal was a favor.

449
00:23:23,505 --> 00:23:26,139
A one favor. Technically,
I don't owe her anything.

450
00:23:26,142 --> 00:23:29,409
Oh, Jones. Let's hope you're right.

451
00:23:30,579 --> 00:23:33,568
It's no problem, we
can pick the trays up.

452
00:23:33,571 --> 00:23:36,416
Thanks, Pop. Sorry for the short notice.

453
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:37,857
Bye.

454
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,219
Trays for what?

455
00:23:40,055 --> 00:23:42,172
Juggie is throwing a retirement party

456
00:23:42,175 --> 00:23:43,390
for FP at the Whyte Wyrm.

457
00:23:43,392 --> 00:23:45,032
And I'm helping him organize.

458
00:23:45,035 --> 00:23:47,327
Before you object, Mom,

459
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:50,063
need I remind you, you were a Serpent?

460
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,001
Betty won't listen to reason,
so I'm telling you, FP,

461
00:23:54,004 --> 00:23:56,084
if she even thinks about
putting on a Serpent jacket,

462
00:23:56,086 --> 00:23:57,521
- I'll have your head.
- I'm working.

463
00:23:57,523 --> 00:23:59,590
I won't have our kids make
the same mistakes we did.

464
00:23:59,593 --> 00:24:00,792
They weren't all mistakes.

465
00:24:00,795 --> 00:24:02,928
If you're that worried, come
to the party. Chaperone her.

466
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:04,678
Are you high on fumes? I can't.

467
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,446
Yes, you can. Stop by.

468
00:24:06,449 --> 00:24:08,876
Say hi to some old friends.

469
00:24:09,594 --> 00:24:11,658
- Hal would never come.
- Well, then leave him.

470
00:24:13,088 --> 00:24:14,821
At home.

471
00:24:19,461 --> 00:24:21,728
So, the real story was
in the Sheriff's notebook.

472
00:24:21,731 --> 00:24:23,397
There was a third child,

473
00:24:23,399 --> 00:24:25,815
Joseph Conway, who
survived the massacre.

474
00:24:25,818 --> 00:24:27,751
They hid his identity, changed his name,

475
00:24:27,754 --> 00:24:29,521
so he could lead a normal life.

476
00:24:29,524 --> 00:24:31,622
- Yeah.
- According to Sheriff Howard's notes,

477
00:24:31,624 --> 00:24:33,724
he was adopted by another
family in Riverdale

478
00:24:33,727 --> 00:24:36,860
and presumably, enrolled
at a local high school.

479
00:24:36,863 --> 00:24:38,499
We got a picture of the kid.

480
00:24:39,435 --> 00:24:41,068
If we match that boy

481
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,636
to one of the students at Riverdale High

482
00:24:42,638 --> 00:24:43,938
during the years he would've attended...

483
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,306
Then he might be able to tell us

484
00:24:45,308 --> 00:24:47,408
how the Conway murders are
connected to the Black Hood.

485
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:49,109
Or he is the Black Hood.

486
00:24:50,413 --> 00:24:51,745
Just go with me here.

487
00:24:51,748 --> 00:24:53,681
Let's say that our mystery kid

488
00:24:53,683 --> 00:24:55,249
did end up surviving the slaughter,

489
00:24:55,251 --> 00:24:56,350
maybe even saw it.

490
00:24:56,352 --> 00:24:57,551
That would've messed him up for life.

491
00:24:57,553 --> 00:24:58,819
Yeah, and somehow, for some reason,

492
00:24:58,821 --> 00:25:01,121
he could be blaming the
town for what happened.

493
00:25:01,123 --> 00:25:02,890
And now is punishing us for it.

494
00:25:02,892 --> 00:25:06,026
So, basically, we just have to
go through all these yearbooks,

495
00:25:06,028 --> 00:25:08,062
page by page, and see
if we find a match.

496
00:25:08,064 --> 00:25:10,592
So, not quite a needle in a haystack.

497
00:25:10,595 --> 00:25:12,028
What?

498
00:25:12,031 --> 00:25:14,602
Uh, we just have to get ready
for a party that we're hosting.

499
00:25:14,604 --> 00:25:17,571
It's my dad's retirement party, so...

500
00:25:17,573 --> 00:25:18,772
- Oh.
- Oh.

501
00:25:18,774 --> 00:25:20,074
No, you guys should come.

502
00:25:20,076 --> 00:25:23,911
Yeah, no, I'm renting a karaoke machine.

503
00:25:23,913 --> 00:25:25,138
It's not a big deal.

504
00:25:25,141 --> 00:25:28,063
- You should come. You guys should come.
- If you want.

505
00:25:35,059 --> 00:25:37,193
Ronnie, can we take a
break and talk about...

506
00:25:37,196 --> 00:25:38,703
Oh, my God.

507
00:25:38,706 --> 00:25:40,194
Is that him?

508
00:25:42,627 --> 00:25:44,160
Could be, yeah.

509
00:25:55,044 --> 00:25:56,343
Mr. Svenson!

510
00:25:56,345 --> 00:25:58,036
Yes.

511
00:25:58,039 --> 00:26:01,282
We know who you are... Joseph Conway.

512
00:26:02,555 --> 00:26:03,921
Hey!

513
00:26:08,647 --> 00:26:11,047
Why did you run, Mr. Svenson?

514
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:12,833
I got scared.

515
00:26:12,836 --> 00:26:15,329
No one's called me
Joe Conway in decades.

516
00:26:15,331 --> 00:26:16,463
We read about your family.

517
00:26:16,465 --> 00:26:18,164
We know you're the
only one that survived.

518
00:26:18,167 --> 00:26:20,267
If you've been tempted
to find justice...

519
00:26:20,269 --> 00:26:21,502
I found justice.

520
00:26:21,504 --> 00:26:22,664
What do you mean?

521
00:26:22,667 --> 00:26:24,471
The night it happened,

522
00:26:25,511 --> 00:26:27,310
I heard gunshots

523
00:26:27,313 --> 00:26:30,654
and I escaped out of my bedroom window.

524
00:26:30,657 --> 00:26:33,414
I could've run into
the woods, but I didn't.

525
00:26:34,164 --> 00:26:36,931
I wanted to see him leave my house.

526
00:26:37,618 --> 00:26:41,053
I saw him covered in my family's blood.

527
00:26:41,056 --> 00:26:42,790
I saw his face.

528
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:46,000
You know who killed your family?

529
00:26:46,003 --> 00:26:47,394
A con man,

530
00:26:47,396 --> 00:26:49,536
a preacher passing through town.

531
00:26:49,539 --> 00:26:53,400
Next day, a group of men took me
to the motel where he was staying.

532
00:26:54,343 --> 00:26:55,943
I pointed him out,

533
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,740
they took him away,

534
00:26:59,742 --> 00:27:01,352
and they killed him.

535
00:27:01,355 --> 00:27:02,576
I'm not sure how.

536
00:27:02,578 --> 00:27:04,641
What happened to the men who did that?

537
00:27:04,644 --> 00:27:05,896
Nothing.

538
00:27:05,899 --> 00:27:08,497
Justice had been served.

539
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,318
It was never reported,
never investigated.

540
00:27:11,321 --> 00:27:13,754
The town demanded blood for blood.

541
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:17,250
You're sounding an awful lot
like the Black Hood right now.

542
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:22,805
Where were you the morning
Fred Andrews was shot?

543
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:23,774
Ronnie...

544
00:27:23,777 --> 00:27:25,443
And the night Ms. Grundy was killed?

545
00:27:25,446 --> 00:27:27,368
- And Moose and Midge,
- Ronnie. Ronnie!

546
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:28,770
- And the Sugarman.
- That's enough!

547
00:27:31,708 --> 00:27:33,946
I've looked into the Black Hood's eyes.

548
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:38,112
We were wrong.

549
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:39,413
It's not him.

550
00:28:13,427 --> 00:28:15,846
Andre's got the car waiting for you,

551
00:28:15,849 --> 00:28:18,744
but I wanted to ask, how
things are with you and Archie?

552
00:28:18,746 --> 00:28:21,713
We've been working on this side project,

553
00:28:21,715 --> 00:28:24,122
and I'm realizing that

554
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:26,447
one of the reasons I
threw myself into it

555
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:28,827
was to avoid talking about the love

556
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,496
that dares not speak its name.

557
00:28:31,623 --> 00:28:33,990
Why can't I say it, Mom?

558
00:28:33,993 --> 00:28:35,855
And why does it have
to be such a big deal?

559
00:28:35,858 --> 00:28:37,391
I mean, you and Daddy never say it.

560
00:28:37,393 --> 00:28:39,593
I mean, I don't think I've
ever heard you say it...

561
00:28:41,018 --> 00:28:42,217
Once.

562
00:28:45,293 --> 00:28:46,693
Oh.

563
00:28:48,504 --> 00:28:50,137
Hey, bud, picking up Veronica?

564
00:28:50,139 --> 00:28:52,373
No, I think I'm just
gonna meet her there.

565
00:28:52,375 --> 00:28:53,340
Oh.

566
00:28:54,477 --> 00:28:56,844
So I take it things didn't go so well

567
00:28:56,846 --> 00:28:59,313
on the other side of the
four-letter-word, huh?

568
00:29:00,074 --> 00:29:01,440
When I'm with Veronica,

569
00:29:01,443 --> 00:29:02,596
as dark as things get

570
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:04,265
and they've been getting pretty dark,

571
00:29:05,168 --> 00:29:08,502
she makes me feel like
everything is gonna be fine.

572
00:29:08,505 --> 00:29:10,357
She makes things fun.

573
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:12,263
I don't wanna lose that.

574
00:29:12,266 --> 00:29:13,461
You won't.

575
00:29:13,464 --> 00:29:15,411
You just gotta give her a little time

576
00:29:15,414 --> 00:29:16,964
and space.

577
00:29:17,667 --> 00:29:19,432
You're a great kid, Arch.

578
00:29:19,435 --> 00:29:22,103
Really, get out there, have a good time.

579
00:29:22,105 --> 00:29:23,571
Take the pressure off.

580
00:29:35,651 --> 00:29:37,916
- Archie, hey.
- Hey.

581
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,854
I just did a sweep of the perimeter.

582
00:29:41,023 --> 00:29:42,156
You good?

583
00:29:42,158 --> 00:29:43,457
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

584
00:29:43,459 --> 00:29:45,393
Ronnie's almost here.

585
00:29:45,396 --> 00:29:48,329
We're gonna clear the air,
it's gonna be a good night.

586
00:29:50,099 --> 00:29:51,398
Here's hoping.

587
00:29:52,201 --> 00:29:53,768
- I'll catch you later, okay?
- Yeah.

588
00:30:05,147 --> 00:30:08,014
Jones, you look nervous.

589
00:30:08,017 --> 00:30:09,316
Want a drink?

590
00:30:10,505 --> 00:30:13,006
No, I'm good. I'm just
getting a lay of the land.

591
00:30:30,642 --> 00:30:32,508
Wow, Betty.

592
00:30:33,176 --> 00:30:34,942
Mrs. Cooper. You look incredible.

593
00:30:34,944 --> 00:30:36,232
Tell me about it.

594
00:30:36,235 --> 00:30:39,052
Unfortunately, I couldn't convince
this one to dress appropriately,

595
00:30:39,849 --> 00:30:41,841
Hog Eye, get me...

596
00:30:41,844 --> 00:30:43,617
Tequila, straight up,

597
00:30:43,619 --> 00:30:45,419
- hold the worm.
- Hold the worm.

598
00:30:46,856 --> 00:30:48,908
I was talkin' to you.

599
00:30:48,911 --> 00:30:51,505
I have a surprise for you. Later.

600
00:30:52,719 --> 00:30:55,753
Mmm. Hit me, Hog Eye.

601
00:30:55,756 --> 00:30:57,923
Honey, what do you
want? A Shirley Temple?

602
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:01,157
- Just give me two.
- Two.

603
00:31:06,175 --> 00:31:08,108
- Hey.
- Hey.

604
00:31:10,179 --> 00:31:11,345
Can we talk?

605
00:31:11,347 --> 00:31:12,913
Not about Svenson,

606
00:31:12,915 --> 00:31:14,448
not about the Black Hood,

607
00:31:14,451 --> 00:31:17,451
not about some murder
house. About us, Ronnie.

608
00:31:17,453 --> 00:31:20,575
Archie, this is a party.

609
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:22,827
Must we discuss serious things tonight?

610
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,597
I just want you to know.

611
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,560
What I said?

612
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:30,464
That was about me and what I was
feeling in that specific moment

613
00:31:30,466 --> 00:31:33,200
and you shouldn't feel any
pressure to say it back to me.

614
00:31:33,202 --> 00:31:34,802
Oh, Archie.

615
00:31:37,206 --> 00:31:38,873
Thank you for understanding.

616
00:31:43,379 --> 00:31:46,647
Yeah, you're welcome.

617
00:31:46,649 --> 00:31:48,619
Uh, yeah.

618
00:31:48,622 --> 00:31:50,851
I, uh, I signed us up for a duet

619
00:31:50,854 --> 00:31:53,807
that Donnie Darko song you love

620
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:56,318
or hopefully, strongly like at least.

621
00:31:57,217 --> 00:31:59,283
- Archie...
- Or can you not do that, either?

622
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,135

Quite the show.

661
00:35:23,827 --> 00:35:25,794
Thanks, Betty.

662
00:35:25,797 --> 00:35:27,197
Here you go.

663
00:35:30,279 --> 00:35:32,739
Let's give her a round of applause!

664
00:35:34,276 --> 00:35:35,309
And show her some of that

665
00:35:35,312 --> 00:35:37,974
Serpent hospitality we're known for.

666
00:35:42,017 --> 00:35:44,955
You know what? I've been
in and out of the Serpents

667
00:35:44,958 --> 00:35:47,254
since I was younger than my son.

668
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:51,692
And it's been a... A wild ride.

669
00:35:51,694 --> 00:35:54,924
Good times, bad times,

670
00:35:54,927 --> 00:35:59,497
but through it all, the
Serpents stuck by my side,

671
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,896
while most other people
turned their backs on me.

672
00:36:02,899 --> 00:36:04,238
My own family included.

673
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,396
Now, the letter of the law

674
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:10,310
says that I can't be here

675
00:36:10,312 --> 00:36:11,401
in the Serpent den.

676
00:36:11,404 --> 00:36:14,882
That I can't associate with my friends.

677
00:36:14,885 --> 00:36:17,451
- My real family.
- Yeah!

678
00:36:17,453 --> 00:36:18,652
My blood.

679
00:36:18,655 --> 00:36:20,621
You're the man!

680
00:36:20,623 --> 00:36:22,723
But I've been thinking about that.

681
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:27,300
And it'll be a cold day in hell

682
00:36:27,303 --> 00:36:30,663
before a snake lets a
pig tell him what to do.

683
00:36:34,103 --> 00:36:36,303
All right, Coyote Ugly, let's go.

684
00:36:36,305 --> 00:36:37,437
No, I'm staying.

685
00:36:37,439 --> 00:36:39,573
Elizabeth, you're coming with me now.

686
00:36:39,575 --> 00:36:41,441
No, I'm staying.

687
00:36:42,378 --> 00:36:43,744
Well, I can't.

688
00:36:45,106 --> 00:36:47,940
Northside wants me outta this gang?

689
00:36:47,943 --> 00:36:50,050
Well, they better bring a coffin

690
00:36:50,053 --> 00:36:53,654
because FP Jones isn't retiring!

691
00:36:53,657 --> 00:36:57,324
I am not going gently into the night!

692
00:36:57,326 --> 00:36:58,926
I'm here to stay!

693
00:36:58,928 --> 00:37:00,761
So, bring the fire!

694
00:37:02,313 --> 00:37:03,404
Yeah!

695
00:37:20,908 --> 00:37:22,541
What happened to retiring?

696
00:37:27,019 --> 00:37:28,752
I know about the Snake Charmer.

697
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:32,507
And the delivery you did
and the debt you owe her.

698
00:37:33,227 --> 00:37:34,986
It was the one thing, son.

699
00:37:34,989 --> 00:37:38,095
The one thing I asked you not to do.

700
00:37:39,531 --> 00:37:41,698
I can fix this. Let me just talk to her.

701
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:45,236
No. No. I'm in, you're out.

702
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:47,471
Penny's my problem now.

703
00:37:52,648 --> 00:37:54,681
You broke my heart, Jughead.

704
00:37:56,348 --> 00:37:58,048
Shots, let's line 'em up!

705
00:38:03,203 --> 00:38:04,302
Hail to the king!

706
00:38:04,305 --> 00:38:06,123
- To the king!
- To the king!

707
00:38:17,936 --> 00:38:20,270
Ronnie, what I said, it doesn't matter

708
00:38:20,272 --> 00:38:22,072
if you don't' wanna say it back to me.

709
00:38:22,074 --> 00:38:24,775
But it does. And it should.

710
00:38:24,778 --> 00:38:26,211
And...

711
00:38:27,255 --> 00:38:29,212
for whatever messed-up reason,

712
00:38:29,214 --> 00:38:32,115
Archie, whatever
deep-seated issues I have,

713
00:38:32,117 --> 00:38:34,384
I can't let myself go there with you.

714
00:38:38,744 --> 00:38:39,977
I'm sorry.

715
00:38:42,846 --> 00:38:44,646
I'm so sorry.

716
00:38:58,283 --> 00:39:00,016
Home, Andre.

717
00:39:00,019 --> 00:39:01,826
Yes, Miss Veronica.

718
00:39:19,007 --> 00:39:20,207
Hey.

719
00:39:21,488 --> 00:39:22,921
What's wrong?

720
00:39:22,924 --> 00:39:24,401
Was it the dance?

721
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:26,552
It's everything.

722
00:39:27,947 --> 00:39:31,216
And, yeah... Why would you do that?

723
00:39:31,219 --> 00:39:35,075
I wanted to be a part of this.

724
00:39:35,078 --> 00:39:36,745
The Serpents, your world.

725
00:39:36,748 --> 00:39:38,215
Why?

726
00:39:39,139 --> 00:39:40,839
Archie knew to cut bait.

727
00:39:42,054 --> 00:39:44,091
Now I'm dragging you down.

728
00:39:44,094 --> 00:39:45,722
I'm dragging my dad down.

729
00:39:45,724 --> 00:39:47,536
Jug, he's still figuring it out.

730
00:39:47,539 --> 00:39:48,705
And It's going to be okay.

731
00:39:48,708 --> 00:39:50,574
We'll figure out what
we have to do, together.

732
00:39:50,577 --> 00:39:52,010
No. Betty... Mmm-mmm.

733
00:39:52,798 --> 00:39:53,997
Not together.

734
00:39:55,246 --> 00:39:56,745
Betty, if you stay,

735
00:39:56,748 --> 00:39:59,239
I don't know if I can
protect you anymore.

736
00:39:59,242 --> 00:40:00,408
You might get...

737
00:40:00,411 --> 00:40:02,044
You probably will get hurt.

738
00:40:02,773 --> 00:40:04,506
I can't let that happen to you.

739
00:40:05,383 --> 00:40:06,983
It's not your decision to make.

740
00:40:06,986 --> 00:40:08,319
Actually...

741
00:40:09,092 --> 00:40:10,291
yeah, it is.

742
00:40:12,604 --> 00:40:14,737
How many times, Jug?

743
00:40:15,728 --> 00:40:18,495
How many time are we going
to push each other away?

744
00:40:18,498 --> 00:40:19,923
Until it sticks.

745
00:40:21,727 --> 00:40:23,286
I was my dad's one chance

746
00:40:23,289 --> 00:40:25,155
at going straight and I wrecked it.

747
00:40:25,158 --> 00:40:27,197
I'm not going to destroy you, too.

748
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:28,857
Just tell me what happened, Jug.

749
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,326
Jug!

750
00:40:30,329 --> 00:40:32,029
Tell me.

751
00:40:32,032 --> 00:40:33,465
Please,

752
00:40:35,853 --> 00:40:37,018
go home.

753
00:40:44,473 --> 00:40:46,139
That night, I realized

754
00:40:46,142 --> 00:40:49,732
it was like we'd been playing
a game of Snakes and Ladders.

755
00:40:49,735 --> 00:40:53,490
Me, Betty, Archie, Veronica.

756
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:56,026
And in one fell swoop,

757
00:40:56,028 --> 00:40:59,971
we all slid off the
board and into free fall

758
00:40:59,974 --> 00:41:02,532
and not just us, other people.

759
00:41:02,535 --> 00:41:04,434
Maybe innocent, maybe not,

760
00:41:04,436 --> 00:41:06,203
had been dragged into our game,

761
00:41:06,205 --> 00:41:08,904
as old wounds reopened.

762
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:13,777
And as feelings that
had long been buried

763
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,979
shook loose.

764
00:41:24,497 --> 00:41:28,592
And a boy looked out his
window at the girl next door

765
00:41:38,405 --> 00:41:42,130
as if for the very first time.
