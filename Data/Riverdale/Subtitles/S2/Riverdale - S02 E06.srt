1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,415
Previously on Riverdale...

2
00:00:01,417 --> 00:00:02,921
This is the Black Hood.

3
00:00:02,923 --> 00:00:04,938
I want to cleanse Riverdale of sinners.

4
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,658
I can't keep doing this.

5
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,695
I need you to cut your
friends out of your life,

6
00:00:09,697 --> 00:00:11,466
or I will, my way.

7
00:00:11,468 --> 00:00:13,765
They'll consider re-opening
The Red and the Black

8
00:00:13,767 --> 00:00:14,833
on two conditions.

9
00:00:14,835 --> 00:00:17,240
One, no gangs. Two, no Jingle Jangle.

10
00:00:17,242 --> 00:00:18,336
You can write about them,

11
00:00:18,338 --> 00:00:20,180
but if I see trafficking
in either, we're done.

12
00:00:20,182 --> 00:00:21,573
You should hang with the Serpents.

13
00:00:21,575 --> 00:00:23,909
The Ghoulies get whiff that
you're alone and vulnerable...

14
00:00:25,546 --> 00:00:27,908
Tall Boy was the one
who gave me this jacket.

15
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,677
It's finally time I start wearing it.

16
00:00:31,292 --> 00:00:33,159
- Is that...
- Jingle Jangle.

17
00:00:34,622 --> 00:00:36,789
Nick, I mean it, stop!

18
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:39,705
We didn't get much of
chance to talk last night.

19
00:00:40,961 --> 00:00:44,596
I want Nick to pay... to
suffer, to burn in hell.

20
00:00:44,598 --> 00:00:46,170
Give me another name.

21
00:00:46,172 --> 00:00:48,066
Nick St. Clair.

22
00:00:49,303 --> 00:00:52,437
In Riverdale, everyone wears a mask,

23
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:54,075
not just the Black Hood.

24
00:00:55,209 --> 00:00:58,030
But every so often, the mask slips

25
00:00:58,032 --> 00:01:02,202
and our true selves are laid
bare, for all the world to see.

26
00:01:02,204 --> 00:01:07,352
Morning. You... you hungry?

27
00:01:07,354 --> 00:01:09,289
You never have to ask me that.

28
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:11,189
Cool.

29
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:17,963
So we scramble to put it back on,

30
00:01:17,965 --> 00:01:20,165
like a kid in a cheap Halloween costume,

31
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:21,633
but it's too late.

32
00:01:21,635 --> 00:01:23,947
People have already
seen what's underneath...

33
00:01:26,206 --> 00:01:27,539
And it's terrifying.

34
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,346
Oh, my God.

35
00:01:44,632 --> 00:01:47,753
What? Here to finish what
your little friends started?

36
00:01:47,755 --> 00:01:49,222
You're alive.

37
00:01:50,353 --> 00:01:52,353
Yeah, and you tell that bitch Veronica

38
00:01:52,355 --> 00:01:54,302
she's lucky I'm not pressing charges.

39
00:01:54,304 --> 00:01:56,968
Nicholas, why aren't you dressed yet?

40
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,504
And who's this?

41
00:01:58,506 --> 00:02:01,741
You're not safe here, okay? Any of you.

42
00:02:01,743 --> 00:02:03,976
You need to go...

43
00:02:03,978 --> 00:02:05,345
Nicholas St. Clair?

44
00:02:05,347 --> 00:02:07,979
He is and I'm his father
is there a problem?

45
00:02:07,981 --> 00:02:09,982
Well, there's been a
complaint made against him.

46
00:02:09,984 --> 00:02:12,569
He's gonna have to come
down to the station.

47
00:02:12,571 --> 00:02:14,253
You and your wife, as well.

48
00:02:14,255 --> 00:02:16,375
You might wanna get dressed, son.

49
00:02:20,961 --> 00:02:22,862
Should I ask what you're doing here?

50
00:02:22,864 --> 00:02:24,364
I'm

51
00:02:25,899 --> 00:02:28,793
making sure Nick got
what was coming to him.

52
00:02:28,795 --> 00:02:30,853
Go home, Betty.

53
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,687
You didn't kill him.

54
00:02:43,689 --> 00:02:46,284
Nick isn't one of Riverdale's sons.

55
00:02:46,286 --> 00:02:48,820
And you'd already given
me the most wonderful gift.

56
00:02:48,822 --> 00:02:52,290
When you said Nick's name,
in that moment of nakedness,

57
00:02:52,292 --> 00:02:54,292
you let me see the real Betty.

58
00:02:54,294 --> 00:02:56,902
And she was beautiful, and righteous.

59
00:02:56,904 --> 00:02:59,731
Judge, jury, executioner...

60
00:02:59,733 --> 00:03:02,235
No, no, that's not. I'm...

61
00:03:02,237 --> 00:03:07,839
Now that I've seen your true self,
Betty, the real work can begin.

62
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:09,032
What do you mean?

63
00:03:17,493 --> 00:03:19,834
_

64
00:03:23,123 --> 00:03:25,157
Penelope, thank you for coming.

65
00:03:25,993 --> 00:03:28,293
We called as soon as Cheryl told us.

66
00:03:29,121 --> 00:03:31,563
And I appreciate that,

67
00:03:31,565 --> 00:03:33,732
I just wish you'd
stopped her from talking

68
00:03:33,734 --> 00:03:35,034
to Sheriff Keller.

69
00:03:35,036 --> 00:03:37,536
Lord knows what Cheryl did or said

70
00:03:37,538 --> 00:03:39,272
to the St. Clair boy to provoke him.

71
00:03:39,274 --> 00:03:41,773
According to Veronica, nothing.

72
00:03:41,775 --> 00:03:43,542
Hermione. Hiram.

73
00:03:43,544 --> 00:03:46,678
I want this handled discreetly.

74
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:50,382
Well, I'm confident that the

75
00:03:50,384 --> 00:03:52,417
St. Clairs feel the same way.

76
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:53,985
Then it's settled.

77
00:03:53,987 --> 00:03:55,754
I'll talk to that idiot Keller

78
00:03:55,756 --> 00:03:58,023
and tell him we won't
be pressing charges.

79
00:03:58,792 --> 00:04:01,126
After all,

80
00:04:01,128 --> 00:04:03,161
nothing really happened to Cheryl.

81
00:04:07,468 --> 00:04:11,003
Cheryl, I'm... so sorry.

82
00:04:11,005 --> 00:04:13,639
Don't be silly. I'm used to it.

83
00:04:13,641 --> 00:04:15,788
And besides, you heard what Mommy said.

84
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,310
Nothing really happened to me.

85
00:04:17,312 --> 00:04:20,179
- Nick roofied you, he tried...
- I'm fine,

86
00:04:20,181 --> 00:04:22,481
Veronica. Everything's fine.

87
00:04:22,483 --> 00:04:23,715
If everything's fine,

88
00:04:23,717 --> 00:04:26,318
why did we call Sheriff
Keller and make a statement?

89
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,687
A momentary lapse in sanity.

90
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:29,632
I mean, can you even imagine?

91
00:04:29,634 --> 00:04:32,524
Me, facing off against Nick St.
Clair in a courtroom battle royale?

92
00:04:32,526 --> 00:04:34,860
- I'd be a laughing stock.
- Cheryl, wait.

93
00:04:36,763 --> 00:04:38,288
It's not just you.

94
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:39,931
He's done it to other girls,

95
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:42,368
I mean, hell, he even
tried to do it to me.

96
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,703
The night before the open house.

97
00:04:45,664 --> 00:04:47,197
Did you tell your parents?

98
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,794
And yet you were happy to fill them in

99
00:04:50,796 --> 00:04:53,105
on my after-dark-drama, weren't you?

100
00:04:53,107 --> 00:04:55,614
Well, I won't be a puppet
for your thirst for vengeance.

101
00:04:55,616 --> 00:04:56,916
You want justice?

102
00:04:56,918 --> 00:04:59,217
You go after Nick in court, Veronica.

103
00:05:04,324 --> 00:05:06,424
Thanks for letting me sleep over.

104
00:05:07,094 --> 00:05:08,660
Now on to the next crashpad

105
00:05:08,662 --> 00:05:10,429
until my uncle stops locking me out.

106
00:05:10,431 --> 00:05:12,330
My trailer is your trailer.

107
00:05:13,467 --> 00:05:16,502
- Last night was...
- A PG-13 grope-session?

108
00:05:16,504 --> 00:05:19,672
Ooh. Way to knock a guy down a peg.

109
00:05:19,674 --> 00:05:22,275
Look, cards on the table.

110
00:05:22,277 --> 00:05:24,442
You're not over Betty,

111
00:05:24,444 --> 00:05:27,913
and I'm not interested in
being anybody's rebound.

112
00:05:27,915 --> 00:05:29,548
Besides,

113
00:05:30,457 --> 00:05:32,423
I'm more into girls anyways.

114
00:05:35,722 --> 00:05:37,055
Roger that.

115
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:40,773
I needed to clear my head and I did.

116
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:45,730
And I realized that this
is just a sick game to him.

117
00:05:45,732 --> 00:05:47,632
Psychological torture.

118
00:05:48,802 --> 00:05:50,874
So,

119
00:05:50,876 --> 00:05:53,071
I'm done. With the Black Hood.

120
00:05:53,073 --> 00:05:55,741
With his letters, with his Simon Says.

121
00:05:55,743 --> 00:05:57,576
So, what happens when he calls again?

122
00:05:57,578 --> 00:05:58,910
I won't answer.

123
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,976
I can't... keep playing. I can't.

124
00:06:03,978 --> 00:06:06,551
- Didn't he threaten Polly?
- He did and I talked to her.

125
00:06:06,553 --> 00:06:09,287
The people at the Farm are gonna
help her disappear for a while.

126
00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:11,389
- Just until it's safe again.
- Yeah, whenever that is.

127
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:12,824
And what about Jughead and Veronica?

128
00:06:12,826 --> 00:06:14,025
We have to tell them the truth.

129
00:06:14,027 --> 00:06:15,260
And we will. I'll tell them. Let's just,

130
00:06:15,262 --> 00:06:16,896
you know, let things settle first.

131
00:06:16,898 --> 00:06:18,964
Make sure it's all over.

132
00:06:29,643 --> 00:06:31,352
- Mom.
- Dad.

133
00:06:32,087 --> 00:06:35,214
Riverdale's best and brightest, huh?

134
00:06:35,216 --> 00:06:37,015
Alice, thank you for hosting.

135
00:06:37,017 --> 00:06:38,584
Of course, Mayor McCoy.

136
00:06:38,586 --> 00:06:40,418
When I heard what
happened at Nick's party,

137
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,388
I decided that we should come together

138
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:45,018
to deal with this motley crew of liars,

139
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,058
dope-fiends, and fornicators.

140
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,828
Except for my Betty, who was
smart enough to leave the party

141
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,998
before it descended into
a bacchanalian free for all

142
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,515
Oh, my God. Mom, please don't.

143
00:06:53,517 --> 00:06:54,790
Oh great, here we go

144
00:06:54,792 --> 00:06:56,568
Saint Betty and Succubus Veronica.

145
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:57,836
So, this is for clarity, Alice.

146
00:06:57,838 --> 00:06:59,971
You're hosting this little
get-together to what?

147
00:06:59,973 --> 00:07:01,673
You know, I may ave taken Jingle Jangle,

148
00:07:01,675 --> 00:07:03,575
but she's the one who
had a psychotic break

149
00:07:03,577 --> 00:07:05,110
Cut her some slack, Veronica.

150
00:07:05,112 --> 00:07:06,244
She just broke up with Jughead

151
00:07:06,246 --> 00:07:07,479
What? Hashtag Bughead is no more?

152
00:07:07,481 --> 00:07:08,480
And Betty didn't tell me?

153
00:07:09,851 --> 00:07:12,985
Careful throwing stones
there, acid-queen Alice.

154
00:07:12,987 --> 00:07:14,686
I'm not the only one in this room

155
00:07:14,688 --> 00:07:16,289
that knows the story behind that mugshot

156
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,118
that your daughter printed in her paper.

157
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,425
Well I, for one, would like to know

158
00:07:20,427 --> 00:07:22,527
who brought the Jingle
Jangle to the party?

159
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:29,701
Reginald, not a single
word out of your mouth

160
00:07:29,703 --> 00:07:30,802
until we get a lawyer.

161
00:07:30,804 --> 00:07:32,837
No, all Reggie needs
to tell us, Melinda,

162
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:34,874
is how he acquired it.

163
00:07:34,876 --> 00:07:36,908
Some gang member who
deals on the Southside...

164
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:38,443
Oh, my God, you have a dealer?

165
00:07:38,445 --> 00:07:39,644
Once again, Mayor,

166
00:07:39,646 --> 00:07:41,813
the Southside is the
source of all our problems.

167
00:07:41,815 --> 00:07:43,882
Was he a Serpent? Does
he go to Southside High?

168
00:07:43,884 --> 00:07:45,450
- I think so, yeah.
- What does it matter?

169
00:07:45,452 --> 00:07:47,085
Not all Serpents are drug dealers.

170
00:07:47,087 --> 00:07:48,420
- Archie, not helping.
- Look,

171
00:07:48,422 --> 00:07:50,088
we shouldn't have taken the JJ,

172
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,023
but Nick's the one who
asked Reggie to get it

173
00:07:52,025 --> 00:07:53,359
and then pushed it on us.

174
00:07:53,361 --> 00:07:55,079
He's the one who should
be in the hot seat.

175
00:07:55,081 --> 00:07:57,896
I mean, he's the one who roofied
Cheryl and tried to assault her.

176
00:07:57,898 --> 00:07:59,330
Prosecuting Nick St.
Clair would be difficult

177
00:07:59,332 --> 00:08:00,865
given that all witnesses were high.

178
00:08:00,867 --> 00:08:02,834
Yeah, but Josie and
I saw Nick with Cheryl

179
00:08:02,836 --> 00:08:05,170
the night after the party, and
neither of us were on Jingle Jangle.

180
00:08:05,172 --> 00:08:07,272
The drug stays in your
system for three days.

181
00:08:07,274 --> 00:08:09,007
So if I drug tested you right now,

182
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:10,809
you'd have a credibility problem.

183
00:08:10,811 --> 00:08:13,068
Josie, you took that drug?

184
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,380
You put that poison in your system,

185
00:08:15,382 --> 00:08:17,916
knowing the way your father's
struggled with addiction?

186
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,020
I see.

187
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:26,024
From this moment on, bringing
the Southside under control

188
00:08:26,026 --> 00:08:27,959
is my number one priority as mayor.

189
00:08:27,961 --> 00:08:29,994
If it means razing it to the ground

190
00:08:29,996 --> 00:08:33,098
or arresting every
single Serpent in sight,

191
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,166
starting at that high school,

192
00:08:35,168 --> 00:08:36,301
so be it.

193
00:08:37,304 --> 00:08:39,585
Let's go, Josephine,

194
00:08:39,587 --> 00:08:41,120
now!

195
00:08:47,447 --> 00:08:49,848
"People have associated this school with

196
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,850
the plagues of the Southside.

197
00:08:51,852 --> 00:08:53,852
Drugs, gangs, violence.

198
00:08:53,854 --> 00:08:57,639
But, like the Southside,
there is a community here.

199
00:08:57,641 --> 00:09:01,292
And while the decay is real,
it is not irreversible."

200
00:09:04,097 --> 00:09:05,998
I'm impressed, Jughead.

201
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,433
Where'd you find the time

202
00:09:08,435 --> 00:09:10,401
to put out an issue of
The Red and the Black

203
00:09:10,403 --> 00:09:12,704
while pledging the Southside Serpents?

204
00:09:14,975 --> 00:09:16,174
I'm not blind.

205
00:09:17,077 --> 00:09:18,777
We had a deal.

206
00:09:19,646 --> 00:09:21,346
The Serpents...

207
00:09:21,348 --> 00:09:24,449
They truly are a
community, Mr. Phillips.

208
00:09:24,451 --> 00:09:26,117
A community of drug-dealers.

209
00:09:26,119 --> 00:09:28,386
That's not the Serpents.
That's the Ghoulies.

210
00:09:28,388 --> 00:09:29,755
That's my next article.

211
00:09:29,757 --> 00:09:31,967
Jughead, when you said...

212
00:09:31,969 --> 00:09:33,057
_

213
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:35,527
Uh, will you excuse
me? Just two seconds.

214
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:37,095
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mr. Phillips.

215
00:09:41,168 --> 00:09:42,535
Jug! Jug!

216
00:09:42,537 --> 00:09:44,235
We gotta go, right now.

217
00:09:44,237 --> 00:09:45,837
What the hell are you doing here?

218
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,672
Betty ask you to throw
some salt in the wound?

219
00:09:47,674 --> 00:09:49,140
Mayor McCoy's about
to raid Southside High.

220
00:09:49,142 --> 00:09:51,342
We gotta get you out of
here, right now, come on.

221
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,990
Toni!

222
00:10:05,992 --> 00:10:07,258
Hey! Hey! Hey!

223
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,359
Jug, you wanna help her?

224
00:10:08,361 --> 00:10:10,728
You can't do that from
behind bars. Come on.

225
00:10:32,844 --> 00:10:36,219

226
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,293
What do you mean Nick did it to you?

227
00:10:43,295 --> 00:10:44,862
He tried to.

228
00:10:44,864 --> 00:10:47,231
After the penthouse party
that I nipped it in the bud.

229
00:10:47,233 --> 00:10:49,968
Ugh, I hope Nick St. Clair
chokes on his silver spoon.

230
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,636
You need to tell someone.
My dad. Or your dad.

231
00:10:52,638 --> 00:10:55,507
No, Kevin. My dad cannot know.

232
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:57,508
Have you ever seen The Godfather?

233
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,476
If my dad ever found
out what Nick did...

234
00:10:59,478 --> 00:11:01,245
What? He'd put a horse's
head in Nick's bed?

235
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:04,715
Worse, he'd put Nick's head in
Mr. and Mrs. St. Clair's bed.

236
00:11:04,717 --> 00:11:07,684
I don't want his blood on
my dad's hands or on mine.

237
00:11:07,686 --> 00:11:09,242
Hey.

238
00:11:11,057 --> 00:11:12,957
- Veronica, I...
- Don't even try,

239
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,224
Benedict Betty.

240
00:11:14,226 --> 00:11:17,327
Chill, Kevin. She's not worth it.

241
00:11:33,546 --> 00:11:35,279
I've done everything you've asked.

242
00:11:35,281 --> 00:11:37,204
Why can't you leave me the hell alone?

243
00:11:37,206 --> 00:11:38,850
Because we're not finished.

244
00:11:38,852 --> 00:11:40,684
I spared Nick's life.

245
00:11:40,686 --> 00:11:43,087
Because of me, you don't
have his blood on your hands.

246
00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:44,188
If you don't help me,

247
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:46,356
you'll be responsible for far worse.

248
00:11:46,358 --> 00:11:48,425
Riverdale's streets will run red.

249
00:11:48,427 --> 00:11:49,943
Help you how?

250
00:11:49,945 --> 00:11:52,896
While Keller and his men
hunt for low-level dealers,

251
00:11:52,898 --> 00:11:54,798
we will go after the real sinner,

252
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,066
the drug maker,

253
00:11:56,068 --> 00:11:58,269
someone who hides behind a name,

254
00:11:58,271 --> 00:11:59,760
the Sugarman.

255
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:03,307
A corrupter of children who
deserves swift, brutal justice.

256
00:12:03,309 --> 00:12:05,209
The fact that you're
asking me to find him

257
00:12:05,211 --> 00:12:06,443
means that you can't.

258
00:12:06,445 --> 00:12:08,445
I'm a school-newspaper reporter.

259
00:12:08,447 --> 00:12:10,812
Who also happens to be
friends with the daughter

260
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:14,161
of the Sugarman's former
supplier, Clifford Blossom.

261
00:12:14,163 --> 00:12:15,510
I'd start there.

262
00:12:15,512 --> 00:12:17,956
And if I find him,
what will you do to him?

263
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:20,934
Don't ask questions you don't
want the answers to, Betty.

264
00:12:20,936 --> 00:12:24,951
Bring me the identity of the
Sugarman, and I will put down my sword.

265
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,864
And if I don't? If I refuse?

266
00:12:26,866 --> 00:12:28,854
Someone will be purified.

267
00:12:28,856 --> 00:12:30,537
Don't test me on that.

268
00:12:33,506 --> 00:12:35,472
- Jughead, calm down.
- Calm down?

269
00:12:35,474 --> 00:12:37,774
Archie, Riverdale just
became a police state.

270
00:12:37,776 --> 00:12:40,310
McCoy's convinced the Serpents
are dealing jingle-jangle.

271
00:12:40,312 --> 00:12:43,345
Serpents don't deal that
stuff. The Ghoulies do.

272
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,847
- So, tell Mayor McCoy that.
- Oh, Mayor McCoy.

273
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:51,693
Do you mean the McCoy that just
arrested all my friends for no reason?

274
00:12:51,695 --> 00:12:53,624
Why do you care anyway, man?

275
00:12:53,626 --> 00:12:56,791
I thought you and Betty wanted
nothing to do with me, right?

276
00:12:56,793 --> 00:12:59,563
I'm sorry about what
happened, and how it happened.

277
00:12:59,565 --> 00:13:02,406
And as for Betty, you
should maybe talk to her.

278
00:13:06,282 --> 00:13:08,749
I gotta go. Tall Boy wants to parley.

279
00:13:16,131 --> 00:13:19,833
Sweet cousin, to what do I
owe this unannounced pleasure?

280
00:13:19,835 --> 00:13:22,216
I just wanted to see how you were doing.

281
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:25,254
I'm... compartmentalizing.

282
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:30,093
But I also see right
through you, Invisible Woman.

283
00:13:30,095 --> 00:13:31,896
I'm writing an article.

284
00:13:31,898 --> 00:13:35,187
On Jingle Jangle inundating Riverdale.

285
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:39,411
- Have you ever heard of the Sugarman?
- Yeah, of course.

286
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,573
What?

287
00:13:42,575 --> 00:13:44,685
As children, Mother told us tales

288
00:13:44,687 --> 00:13:48,212
of how Daddy was friends
with the so-called Sugarman.

289
00:13:48,214 --> 00:13:49,246
And if we were bad,

290
00:13:49,248 --> 00:13:51,955
he'd sneak into our rooms at
night, steal us from our beds,

291
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,797
whisk us away, nevermore to be seen.

292
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:58,636
Cheryl, is it possible
that this man maybe worked

293
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,891
for your father's drug business?

294
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:06,723
Dear God, Betty, is there no memory,
however traumatic, you won't defile?

295
00:14:06,726 --> 00:14:09,132
- I'm just trying to get to the truth.
- I've told you the truth..

296
00:14:09,134 --> 00:14:12,690
The Sugarman was a poison confection
spun by my mother to scare children.

297
00:14:12,693 --> 00:14:15,400
Like the sandman or Krampus.

298
00:14:15,403 --> 00:14:16,904
Now, fly away, little bird.

299
00:14:22,243 --> 00:14:25,286
Community service? Can't
you just ground me, Dad?

300
00:14:25,288 --> 00:14:28,355
Community service was
Mayor McCoy's idea,

301
00:14:28,358 --> 00:14:30,583
and it's a damn good one if you ask me.

302
00:14:30,585 --> 00:14:32,835
You wanna put that trash in your body,

303
00:14:32,837 --> 00:14:35,755
you can spend the day picking
up trash at Pickens Park.

304
00:14:38,259 --> 00:14:40,968
I know Jug wasn't at your
Lollapalooza the other night,

305
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:44,305
but he does go to Southside High.
It's ground zero for that crap.

306
00:14:44,307 --> 00:14:46,850
You talking to him,
checking in? How's he doing?

307
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:48,436
- Trying to.
- Yeah.

308
00:14:49,716 --> 00:14:52,635
It was kind of like that
when I was trying to help FP.

309
00:14:53,691 --> 00:14:57,360
I don't what it is. A
never-ending battle with those two.

310
00:14:57,362 --> 00:14:59,695
I just hope with Jug
it's not a losing one.

311
00:15:04,772 --> 00:15:05,995
Sit down, kid.

312
00:15:06,954 --> 00:15:08,498
Business to discuss.

313
00:15:09,123 --> 00:15:12,319
Tall Boy, what the hell
is this? Where are we?

314
00:15:12,322 --> 00:15:13,711
You're in my house.

315
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,966
It's the House of the Dead.

316
00:15:20,677 --> 00:15:23,094
Well, I'm sorry, who the hell are you?

317
00:15:23,096 --> 00:15:25,054
Take it easy, Jughead.

318
00:15:25,056 --> 00:15:27,100
Malachai speaks for the Ghoulies.

319
00:15:27,725 --> 00:15:30,810
The heat on us and our ranks
depleted, our tribes need to unite,

320
00:15:30,812 --> 00:15:35,272
and that's gonna be easier to do
if you endorse this partnership.

321
00:15:35,274 --> 00:15:37,274
- Me?
- You're FP's son.

322
00:15:37,276 --> 00:15:40,319
That carries weight, especially
with our younger members.

323
00:15:40,321 --> 00:15:43,864
Tall Boy, they're the reason
Southside was even raided.

324
00:15:43,866 --> 00:15:47,451
Them and their jingle-jangle.
- Chaos is how we thrive.

325
00:15:47,453 --> 00:15:49,205
You'd better get used to it.

326
00:15:50,331 --> 00:15:52,623
Are you seriously
gonna do this to my dad?

327
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:56,295
- You're supposed to be his right hand.
- The Northside declared war today.

328
00:15:58,548 --> 00:16:01,549
Your old man ain't
here to call the shots.

329
00:16:01,551 --> 00:16:04,303
And, yeah, I'm his right hand.

330
00:16:04,961 --> 00:16:08,266
That makes me de facto
leader here and now. So...

331
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,394
things are changing, Jones.

332
00:16:12,228 --> 00:16:14,021
Either you change with them...

333
00:16:15,606 --> 00:16:17,692
or suffer the consequences.

334
00:16:20,737 --> 00:16:22,071
Evolve or die, baby.

335
00:16:23,114 --> 00:16:24,657
Evolve or die.

336
00:16:57,607 --> 00:17:01,108
Sheriff Keller. The station
said you might be here.

337
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,443
I'm off the clock, Betty.

338
00:17:02,445 --> 00:17:06,071
Just a few questions for a Blue
and Gold story on jingle-jangle.

339
00:17:06,073 --> 00:17:07,656
All right.

340
00:17:07,658 --> 00:17:09,744
One question, so, you'd
better make it good.

341
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:13,873
Have you ever heard of a
dealer called the Sugarman?

342
00:17:14,749 --> 00:17:18,667
Have I heard of him? Well,
I know him. You know him.

343
00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:21,420
The Sugarman, the Maple
Man, the Delivery Man,

344
00:17:21,422 --> 00:17:24,840
he had about a million different
names, but it was always just one man.

345
00:17:24,842 --> 00:17:25,927
Clifford Blossom.

346
00:17:26,552 --> 00:17:28,177
But he's dead.

347
00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:31,096
So, how is there still a
supply of jingle-jangle?

348
00:17:31,098 --> 00:17:35,142
Jingle-jangle didn't hit the
streets until after Clifford died.

349
00:17:35,144 --> 00:17:38,439
Truth is, anybody could
be the supplier now.

350
00:17:39,649 --> 00:17:40,733
Good night, Betty.

351
00:17:47,907 --> 00:17:50,034
Drafting your next savage takedown?

352
00:17:56,499 --> 00:18:01,460
I don't expect you to believe
me, but I didn't mean what I said.

353
00:18:01,462 --> 00:18:03,128
There's no sane excuse.

354
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:04,959
No, there isn't.

355
00:18:04,962 --> 00:18:06,300
So, tell me, B...

356
00:18:07,552 --> 00:18:09,011
what's the insane excuse?

357
00:18:14,684 --> 00:18:16,853
So, to recap...

358
00:18:18,563 --> 00:18:21,897
you're talking to a
serial killer on the reg...

359
00:18:21,899 --> 00:18:23,985
and he's been puppet-mastering you?

360
00:18:26,237 --> 00:18:28,906
I'll never forgive
myself for what I did, V.

361
00:18:29,991 --> 00:18:33,659
To you, to Jug, to my mom.
Hell, even to Nick St. Clair.

362
00:18:33,661 --> 00:18:36,120
Girl, I would've given Nick's name

363
00:18:36,122 --> 00:18:38,708
and then happily treated
myself to a facial.

364
00:18:39,834 --> 00:18:41,917
I still may. But, yes...

365
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,087
you're in a toxic relationship
with the Black Hood

366
00:18:45,089 --> 00:18:48,301
- and you need to break up.
- Or I could turn the tables on him, V.

367
00:18:48,304 --> 00:18:51,762
He says he'll go away
if I do one last thing...

368
00:18:51,765 --> 00:18:54,761
find out who's behind the jingle-jangle.

369
00:18:54,764 --> 00:18:57,099
Some creep called the Sugarman.

370
00:18:57,101 --> 00:18:59,101
Okay. So, what's the problem?

371
00:18:59,103 --> 00:19:01,604
If the Sugarman exists
and I find out who he is,

372
00:19:01,606 --> 00:19:03,314
I can't just give up his name.

373
00:19:03,316 --> 00:19:05,608
The Black Hood would kill him.

374
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:08,736
Drug dealer or not,
he's still a human being.

375
00:19:08,738 --> 00:19:11,697
- Barely.
- I'm so close, V.

376
00:19:11,699 --> 00:19:12,867
Will you help?

377
00:19:16,537 --> 00:19:17,663
I'm in.

378
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:24,378
This isn't an alliance with the
Ghoulies. This is a hostile takeover.

379
00:19:25,212 --> 00:19:29,298
God, who knows how long Tall Boy
has been planning on betraying us.

380
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,092
Maybe I stall, just until
Sweet Pea and Toni get out.

381
00:19:32,094 --> 00:19:35,304
I just hope they'd rather go to
war with the Ghoulies than start...

382
00:19:35,306 --> 00:19:37,139
- Jughead.
- Dealing jingle-jangle.

383
00:19:37,141 --> 00:19:39,183
You joined the Serpents
to keep the peace.

384
00:19:39,185 --> 00:19:42,730
My dad would never sit back and
let this happen, so, neither will I.

385
00:19:43,356 --> 00:19:45,531
So, unless you have any better ideas...

386
00:19:45,534 --> 00:19:48,821
Not me. But, dude, what you just said...

387
00:19:52,782 --> 00:19:54,700
Start from the beginning, boys.

388
00:20:01,514 --> 00:20:05,557
Hey, you can reprimand me for
joining the Serpents later,

389
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:07,492
but if we don't do something now...

390
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:13,150
there will be no more Serpents.
It'll just be the Ghoulies.

391
00:20:15,111 --> 00:20:18,114
Ghoulies dress like fops,
but they're a nasty crew.

392
00:20:19,323 --> 00:20:22,199
The Serpents have
survived worse, though.

393
00:20:22,201 --> 00:20:26,286
Much worse. The only hitch is,
it sounds like you're outmanned,

394
00:20:26,288 --> 00:20:29,748
which means you gotta avoid
bloodshed at all costs.

395
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,626
- I agree. A hundred percent.
- So, outthink them.

396
00:20:32,628 --> 00:20:34,128
This is about territory.

397
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,838
If there's one thing Ghoulies love,

398
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,924
it's their crazy souped-up
retro cars and hearses.

399
00:20:38,926 --> 00:20:41,011
You catch my Riverdale drift, boys?

400
00:20:45,266 --> 00:20:50,060
Challenge them to a
street race, one-on-one.

401
00:20:50,062 --> 00:20:54,064
But keep it on the DL. It's
illegal. It'll get you locked up.

402
00:20:54,066 --> 00:20:56,485
- Go on.
- Set the terms of the race.

403
00:20:57,111 --> 00:20:59,570
Their guy wins, the Serpents roll over.

404
00:20:59,572 --> 00:21:03,365
But if we win, the Ghoulies back off.

405
00:21:03,367 --> 00:21:08,954
And maybe you raise the stakes.
Whoever wins controls Southside High.

406
00:21:08,956 --> 00:21:11,957
We get rid of the Ghoulies and
get rid of the jingle-jangle

407
00:21:11,959 --> 00:21:13,753
and get McCoy off our back.

408
00:21:20,551 --> 00:21:24,178
That's me, that's Jason,
and that's the Sugarman.

409
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:27,514
Remember? You'd tell us tales
of how he was friends with Daddy?

410
00:21:27,516 --> 00:21:30,895
We were to stay up in our rooms
whenever he visited Thornhill?

411
00:21:32,188 --> 00:21:35,107
Was he one of Daddy's
business associates?

412
00:21:36,192 --> 00:21:40,154
Not maple syrup, but the
other kind of business?

413
00:21:42,406 --> 00:21:45,699
After all you kept from me
about Daddy, about Jason's death,

414
00:21:45,701 --> 00:21:48,243
is this another piece
of your cryptic puzzle?

415
00:21:48,245 --> 00:21:51,288
As usual, Cheryl, I have no
idea what you're talking about.

416
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:54,166
I never told you any such stories.

417
00:21:54,168 --> 00:21:56,168
As for your father's business dealings,

418
00:21:56,170 --> 00:22:00,380
you know full well that all his
records were either seized by the police

419
00:22:00,382 --> 00:22:03,135
or burned in the fire you started.

420
00:22:09,683 --> 00:22:12,265
Pickens Park? More like Needle Park.

421
00:22:12,268 --> 00:22:14,482
I wouldn't even go cruising here.

422
00:22:16,899 --> 00:22:19,443
Hey, uh, feel free
to, you know, pitch in.

423
00:22:20,069 --> 00:22:23,045
I get you're pretty much Beyoncé, but

424
00:22:23,048 --> 00:22:25,656
today, you're just like us commoners.

425
00:22:25,658 --> 00:22:28,742
I think your biceps
can handle it, Mantle.

426
00:22:28,744 --> 00:22:30,786
- You trying to get me to flex?
- Josie.

427
00:22:30,788 --> 00:22:33,664
You mind if I borrow Reggie
for a New York minute?

428
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:35,292
Please. Take him.

429
00:22:36,252 --> 00:22:38,420
Love watching me walk away, huh?

430
00:22:40,422 --> 00:22:41,838
What do you want, Veronica?

431
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,633
We were kind of in the
middle of something.

432
00:22:44,635 --> 00:22:46,885
I want the name of your
jingle-jangle contact,

433
00:22:46,887 --> 00:22:48,722
and I won't take no for an answer.

434
00:22:50,808 --> 00:22:53,058
Betty, you have to talk to Jughead.

435
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,187
Soon, I promise.

436
00:22:56,564 --> 00:22:58,607
I just need to take
care of a few things.

437
00:23:10,268 --> 00:23:14,331
I'll go out on a limb and guess
you're Verne. You got my stuff?

438
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:19,044
- I don't take American Excess.
- Will this do?

439
00:23:20,254 --> 00:23:22,170
My girl and I need a
reason to live tonight.

440
00:23:22,172 --> 00:23:24,675
She broke up with her
beau. Full spiral. Tragic.

441
00:23:25,301 --> 00:23:26,135
One fifty.

442
00:23:27,428 --> 00:23:30,097
I know you're overcharging
me, but I'm desperate.

443
00:23:31,765 --> 00:23:33,601
My compliments to the Sugarman.

444
00:23:35,811 --> 00:23:38,014
Did I get it wrong? Isn't that the name

445
00:23:38,017 --> 00:23:40,272
of the genius behind these sweet treats?

446
00:23:40,274 --> 00:23:41,609
Have you ever met him?

447
00:23:43,485 --> 00:23:45,321
What about my change, asshat?

448
00:23:48,991 --> 00:23:51,783
Our Drugstore Cowboy
should be passing you

449
00:23:51,785 --> 00:23:55,454
in three... two... one.

450
00:23:55,456 --> 00:23:56,707
I've got eyes on him.

451
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:01,934
Me and my boy...

452
00:24:01,937 --> 00:24:04,340
wanna challenge you to a race.

453
00:24:06,008 --> 00:24:07,009
If we win...

454
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,552
Serpents remain autonomous...

455
00:24:10,554 --> 00:24:12,890
and you quit dealing at Southside High.

456
00:24:14,308 --> 00:24:15,851
And if we win?

457
00:24:16,602 --> 00:24:17,519
We fold...

458
00:24:18,395 --> 00:24:20,446
and you can continue polluting Southside

459
00:24:20,449 --> 00:24:22,147
with your little straws of death.

460
00:24:22,149 --> 00:24:26,652
So, the mighty Serpent Prince has
some stones, but not much else.

461
00:24:26,654 --> 00:24:28,319
So, unless Your Highness wants to put

462
00:24:28,322 --> 00:24:30,838
some of Daddy's territory on the table,

463
00:24:30,841 --> 00:24:33,199
I got no reason to agree to a race.

464
00:24:33,202 --> 00:24:35,529
They were following me.
Tried to get in the garage.

465
00:24:35,532 --> 00:24:36,739
- Veronica?
- Betty?

466
00:24:36,742 --> 00:24:38,325
- Archie?
- Jughead?

467
00:24:38,328 --> 00:24:40,579
What are you doing here?

468
00:24:40,582 --> 00:24:44,836
- Wait. So, these are your bitches?
- I beg your misogynistic pardon?

469
00:24:44,838 --> 00:24:48,090
Why don't you take your skanks
and get the hell out of here?

470
00:24:48,092 --> 00:24:51,301
Until you make me a better
offer, there'll be no race.

471
00:24:51,303 --> 00:24:55,307
If you win... we'll
give you the Whyte Wyrm.

472
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,758
You can expand your
drug-dealing horizons

473
00:24:58,761 --> 00:25:01,395
and upgrade out of
this literal hellhole.

474
00:25:01,397 --> 00:25:04,983
We'll take the Wyrm and
Sunnyside Trailer Park.

475
00:25:15,394 --> 00:25:17,939
Two turkey burgers and
a Cobb salad. To go.

476
00:25:20,983 --> 00:25:22,151
Sharon.

477
00:25:22,818 --> 00:25:23,903
Cheryl.

478
00:25:26,405 --> 00:25:28,447
What are you still doing in town, Nick?

479
00:25:28,449 --> 00:25:31,116
Picking up some fuel for the trip home.

480
00:25:31,118 --> 00:25:32,286
How are you?

481
00:25:32,289 --> 00:25:33,913
How am I?

482
00:25:36,582 --> 00:25:38,222
How am I?

483
00:25:38,225 --> 00:25:40,136
You roofied me.

484
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:44,131
- You tried to rape me.
- I don't think that's what happened.

485
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:47,508
You're a Less Than Zero monster.

486
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:50,928
At least I'm not a desperate
tart from a truck-stop town, hon.

487
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:54,056
Let's not distort reality to
cover your morning-after shame.

488
00:25:54,058 --> 00:25:57,061
You were high, half-naked
and begging for it.

489
00:25:58,688 --> 00:25:59,730
Call your lawyer.

490
00:26:00,898 --> 00:26:03,315
Seeing as you're such
an unrepentant spore,

491
00:26:03,317 --> 00:26:06,068
I think I'll be pressing
charges after all.

492
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:09,488
Sweetie, did no one tell you about
the arrangement my parents made

493
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:11,158
with your cobra-like mother?

494
00:26:11,951 --> 00:26:14,912
You're not gonna be saying
anything about that night to anyone.

495
00:26:15,913 --> 00:26:19,125
After all, there's a reason
it's called hush money.

496
00:26:22,503 --> 00:26:24,255
For the lady's meal, as well.

497
00:26:28,134 --> 00:26:31,971
God bless Reggie Mantle
and his inferiority complex.

498
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:36,682
His car's a lot like him.
It's beautiful to look at...

499
00:26:36,684 --> 00:26:38,936
but not much going on under the hood.

500
00:26:40,771 --> 00:26:42,898
Um, crescent wrench, please.

501
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:47,153
Thank you.

502
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,244
So, this is what Serpents do for
fun, huh? Street-race rival gangs?

503
00:26:57,246 --> 00:26:59,165
Just go ahead and say it, Betty.

504
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:07,046
You said you weren't
gonna join them, Jug.

505
00:27:07,048 --> 00:27:11,675
And you said you loved me, and
then you dumped me via Archie.

506
00:27:11,678 --> 00:27:15,723
Which, by the way, way
worse than via text.

507
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:20,886
I'm sorry, Jughead.

508
00:27:23,939 --> 00:27:25,608
It won't make any sense...

509
00:27:26,942 --> 00:27:31,405
but everything around us was
imploding, and I did it to protect you.

510
00:27:33,699 --> 00:27:37,242
Betty, you did the one thing
that could actually hurt me.

511
00:27:37,244 --> 00:27:40,998
I will explain everything
to you, Jug, I will.

512
00:27:42,917 --> 00:27:46,045
But right now, I just wanna
get you through this race.

513
00:27:53,761 --> 00:27:56,261
I had the most fascinating
chat with Nick today.

514
00:27:56,263 --> 00:27:59,558
Then I went rummaging around
your bedroom until I found this.

515
00:28:00,851 --> 00:28:04,647
Before you start casting
stones, you should kn...

516
00:28:06,148 --> 00:28:09,316
The Lodges are still accepting
money from the St. Clairs

517
00:28:09,318 --> 00:28:11,308
for their precious SoDale construction.

518
00:28:11,311 --> 00:28:13,404
I don't care about them.

519
00:28:13,406 --> 00:28:15,282
I care about my mother.

520
00:28:17,785 --> 00:28:21,789
You defend Daddy even after
he murdered your son...

521
00:28:24,417 --> 00:28:26,127
but you won't stand up for me.

522
00:28:27,044 --> 00:28:29,711
Not even against my would-be rapist.

523
00:28:29,713 --> 00:28:31,799
Oh, don't be absurd, Cheryl.

524
00:28:32,591 --> 00:28:34,135
And give me that check.

525
00:28:37,763 --> 00:28:40,264
Not until you tell me the
truth about the Sugarman.

526
00:28:40,266 --> 00:28:41,974
He exists, Mother.

527
00:28:41,976 --> 00:28:43,809
We both know it.

528
00:28:43,811 --> 00:28:45,602
He worked with Daddy.

529
00:28:45,604 --> 00:28:46,895
Your father...

530
00:28:46,897 --> 00:28:50,315
Was an awful human being,
and thank God he's dead.

531
00:28:50,317 --> 00:28:53,320
But I'm alive, and I'm begging you...

532
00:28:54,613 --> 00:28:57,742
for once in your life,
be honest with me.

533
00:28:59,076 --> 00:29:00,786
Care about me more.

534
00:29:09,086 --> 00:29:10,045
It's simple.

535
00:29:11,714 --> 00:29:14,214
The St. Clairs bought your silence.

536
00:29:14,216 --> 00:29:17,803
But you're not getting
paid until I hear the truth.

537
00:29:24,769 --> 00:29:26,187
What can I say...

538
00:29:28,355 --> 00:29:29,190
or do...

539
00:29:30,608 --> 00:29:32,526
to get you to stay here with me?

540
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,155
Instead of going to that dangerous...

541
00:29:38,157 --> 00:29:41,619
dumb, possibly deadly street race?

542
00:29:42,912 --> 00:29:44,997
Don't worry, Ronnie, I have a plan.

543
00:29:47,166 --> 00:29:49,168
Like the plan you and Betty had when

544
00:29:49,171 --> 00:29:51,172
you snuck into Ghoulie headquarters.

545
00:29:55,257 --> 00:29:56,511
Touché.

546
00:29:56,514 --> 00:29:59,259
One that hopefully keeps everyone alive.

547
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,975
Cheryl?

548
00:30:06,852 --> 00:30:07,895
What? Slow down.

549
00:30:10,856 --> 00:30:11,941
They what?

550
00:30:16,403 --> 00:30:19,655
Are you still doing
business with the St. Clairs?

551
00:30:19,657 --> 00:30:22,032
Letting them invest in
SoDale after what Nick did?

552
00:30:22,034 --> 00:30:25,619
- To be fair, Cheryl's accusations...
- Cheryl's telling the truth.

553
00:30:25,621 --> 00:30:28,165
I know, because Nick
tried to do it to me.

554
00:30:31,669 --> 00:30:34,169
Nick St. Clair... hurt you?

555
00:30:34,171 --> 00:30:35,462
Tried to.

556
00:30:35,464 --> 00:30:37,563
But I stopped him before he got too far.

557
00:30:37,566 --> 00:30:39,508
The next night, he went after Cheryl.

558
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:43,470
- Veronica, why didn't you say something?
- I didn't have any proof.

559
00:30:43,472 --> 00:30:46,306
And Nick has done it
before, I'm sure of it.

560
00:30:46,308 --> 00:30:50,269
Veronica, as God is my witness,
I swear to you, I will...

561
00:30:50,271 --> 00:30:54,108
Under no circumstances will we
take a penny from that family.

562
00:30:55,442 --> 00:30:58,777
All right, let's do this!

563
00:30:58,779 --> 00:31:00,320
All right!

564
00:31:00,322 --> 00:31:03,574
Not the kind of drag race I
ever imagined myself going to,

565
00:31:03,576 --> 00:31:05,450
but at least the guys are hot.

566
00:31:08,706 --> 00:31:10,455
Don't worry, Ronnie, we got this.

567
00:31:10,457 --> 00:31:12,249
Just make it back to me.

568
00:31:12,251 --> 00:31:14,795
Preferably in one piece, Archiekins.

569
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,845
Before you get in the
car, I need you to know...

570
00:31:26,223 --> 00:31:28,392
I never stopped loving you, Jug.

571
00:31:29,518 --> 00:31:31,478
I'm not sure I can.

572
00:31:32,563 --> 00:31:37,484
Also remember, don't ride the clutch,
and don't let it slip between gear shifts.

573
00:31:39,153 --> 00:31:40,611
You're an enigma, Cooper.

574
00:31:40,613 --> 00:31:42,988
- Let's do it!
- Yeah!

575
00:31:47,745 --> 00:31:49,371
Get these cars up in a row!

576
00:31:57,713 --> 00:32:00,839
Race over Herk Harvey
Bridge to Dead Man's Curve.

577
00:32:00,841 --> 00:32:02,507
First one back here wins.

578
00:32:02,509 --> 00:32:05,510
- Uh, I usually do the honors.
- Not today, Cha-Cha.

579
00:32:05,512 --> 00:32:07,139
I was born for this moment.

580
00:32:22,947 --> 00:32:25,574
Engines warm and ready, gentlemen?

581
00:33:02,027 --> 00:33:03,320
Whoo.

582
00:33:04,321 --> 00:33:05,155
Damn it.

583
00:33:16,208 --> 00:33:19,084
- Jug, we're coming up to the bridge.
- I know. I got this.

584
00:33:19,086 --> 00:33:21,505
It's too narrow for both of us, Jughead.

585
00:33:27,344 --> 00:33:28,885
Jug, we should abort.

586
00:33:28,887 --> 00:33:31,263
- And let them win?
- We will both crash on that bridge.

587
00:33:31,265 --> 00:33:34,393
Serpents are joining the Ghoulies
over my dead body, Archie.

588
00:33:35,769 --> 00:33:39,104
I'm sorry, man, but I'm
not down for those terms.

589
00:33:50,409 --> 00:33:51,616
Why would you do that?

590
00:33:51,618 --> 00:33:53,869
Trust me, Jug, you're
gonna thank me for this.

591
00:33:56,623 --> 00:33:59,791
Jug, stop! Jug! Jug!

592
00:33:59,793 --> 00:34:01,189
Jug!

593
00:34:11,263 --> 00:34:13,724
Come on, Jug, we gotta go. Come on.

594
00:34:18,078 --> 00:34:21,122
Everyone scatter! The cops
are rounding up Ghoulies!

595
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:27,792
- Oh, my God, you're okay.
- We gotta get out of here.

596
00:34:27,795 --> 00:34:31,007
- Come on, we gotta go. Right now.
- You called the cops?

597
00:34:32,092 --> 00:34:34,551
You won't throw in with the
Ghoulies, but you will with cops?

598
00:34:34,553 --> 00:34:37,512
- Where's the honor in that?
- Calm down, Tall Boy.

599
00:34:37,514 --> 00:34:40,932
- You think I knew Keller would be there?
- I called Keller.

600
00:34:40,934 --> 00:34:42,350
What the hell, Archie?

601
00:34:42,352 --> 00:34:44,102
Did my dad tell you about this, too?

602
00:34:44,104 --> 00:34:47,230
No, this was my idea to get
rid of the Ghoulies. It worked.

603
00:34:47,232 --> 00:34:49,524
They get arrested for racing,
they're off the chessboard.

604
00:34:49,526 --> 00:34:51,442
For how long? One month? Three months?

605
00:34:51,444 --> 00:34:53,570
You know what they'll
want on the other side?

606
00:34:53,572 --> 00:34:56,199
Your head on a stake! All of ours!

607
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:11,256
Careful you don't get burned again.

608
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,844
You said I never protected you.

609
00:35:19,514 --> 00:35:20,849
The Sugarman...

610
00:35:22,267 --> 00:35:24,060
was a story I concocted...

611
00:35:24,936 --> 00:35:28,521
to turn an all-too-real monster

612
00:35:28,523 --> 00:35:31,024
into a child's bogeyman.

613
00:35:31,026 --> 00:35:32,569
And it worked, for a while.

614
00:35:33,486 --> 00:35:34,988
But now I need the truth.

615
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,703
Over the years, there
were many Sugarmen...

616
00:35:43,204 --> 00:35:45,165
each taking over for the last.

617
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,418
When Clifford decided

618
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:53,632
to groom your brother to take
over the family business...

619
00:35:54,966 --> 00:35:58,136
he wanted him to meet
the current Sugarman.

620
00:36:01,264 --> 00:36:04,392
I protested, but your father insisted...

621
00:36:05,644 --> 00:36:06,978
and God help me...

622
00:36:08,813 --> 00:36:13,526
so began the terrible series of
events that led to Jason's death.

623
00:36:45,809 --> 00:36:48,436
Thank you for that, Mommy.

624
00:36:49,729 --> 00:36:53,233
One more question: Who
is the sugarman right now?

625
00:36:58,738 --> 00:37:00,615
Oh, my God, is that the Black Hood?

626
00:37:03,785 --> 00:37:04,786
It's Cheryl.

627
00:37:06,371 --> 00:37:07,205
Hey.

628
00:37:08,873 --> 00:37:09,708
You did?

629
00:37:11,835 --> 00:37:12,752
Who is he?

630
00:37:15,422 --> 00:37:17,215
Wait, are you positive?

631
00:37:21,386 --> 00:37:22,220
Betty?

632
00:37:24,514 --> 00:37:27,058
Cheryl just told me the Sugarman's name.

633
00:37:28,059 --> 00:37:30,729
Oh, my God, Cheryl
Bombshell for the win.

634
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,985
What do I do, Veronica?

635
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,670
If I give the Black Hood his name,

636
00:37:40,673 --> 00:37:42,572
may God have mercy on the Sugarman.

637
00:37:42,574 --> 00:37:43,827
And if I don't...

638
00:37:44,835 --> 00:37:47,078
may God have mercy on all of us.

639
00:38:00,374 --> 00:38:02,124
I assume my time's up?

640
00:38:02,126 --> 00:38:05,169
Yes, Betty. Have you found him for me?

641
00:38:05,171 --> 00:38:06,462
I did.

642
00:38:06,464 --> 00:38:09,175
Good girl. Now tell me his name.

643
00:38:12,053 --> 00:38:13,054
I could.

644
00:38:15,097 --> 00:38:17,350
But that wouldn't do you any good now.

645
00:38:18,643 --> 00:38:21,103
I've already notified
the sheriff's office.

646
00:38:22,438 --> 00:38:24,756
You'll have to read
his name in the exposé

647
00:38:24,759 --> 00:38:26,861
I just published in the Blue and Gold.

648
00:38:29,109 --> 00:38:30,404
Care to comment?

649
00:38:31,405 --> 00:38:34,156
I told you what would happen.

650
00:38:34,158 --> 00:38:39,453
The Sugarman needed to be
brought to justice, not execution.

651
00:38:39,455 --> 00:38:42,289
He will be dealt with in the right way.

652
00:38:42,291 --> 00:38:44,543
You're playing a risky game.

653
00:38:47,546 --> 00:38:48,381
Yeah...

654
00:38:50,174 --> 00:38:51,966
but it's my game now.

655
00:38:51,968 --> 00:38:54,343
Which is what, Betty?

656
00:38:54,345 --> 00:38:57,014
A game that ends with me catching you.

657
00:38:58,766 --> 00:39:02,895
I found out who killed Jason Blossom.
I found out who the Sugarman was.

658
00:39:06,649 --> 00:39:09,735
You're next, Black Hood.

659
00:39:12,571 --> 00:39:14,657
I'm breathing down your neck.

660
00:39:16,951 --> 00:39:18,035
Can you feel it?

661
00:39:20,663 --> 00:39:22,537
Can you feel me?

662
00:39:24,792 --> 00:39:27,126
What are the other Serpents saying?

663
00:39:27,128 --> 00:39:28,417
Some people give you props for

664
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:31,129
challenging the Ghoulies
and beating them.

665
00:39:31,132 --> 00:39:33,173
Others hate that you
cut a deal with Keller

666
00:39:33,175 --> 00:39:36,276
- because it puts us in bed with the pigs.
- I didn't. That was Archie.

667
00:39:36,279 --> 00:39:39,138
Yeah, I know that and you know
that, but some of them don't.

668
00:39:41,434 --> 00:39:43,477
No, is this another raid?

669
00:39:44,186 --> 00:39:45,229
Didn't you hear?

670
00:39:49,692 --> 00:39:51,360
They caught the Sugarman.

671
00:40:06,751 --> 00:40:10,569
Did you hear about that teacher
at Southside High who got arrested?

672
00:40:10,572 --> 00:40:12,655
Jughead was in one of his classes.

673
00:40:12,658 --> 00:40:16,010
- How's he dealing?
- Honestly, Dad, I'm not sure.

674
00:40:16,515 --> 00:40:18,529
I tried helping Jughead with something,

675
00:40:18,532 --> 00:40:20,890
and it backfired.
He's pretty pissed off.

676
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,642
Well, it's not the
first fight you guys had.

677
00:40:25,644 --> 00:40:29,313
Pretty sure it won't be the
last. You'll patch it up.

678
00:40:29,315 --> 00:40:30,526
Are you okay, Dad?

679
00:40:30,529 --> 00:40:33,488
Mm-hm. Yeah. Feeling better every day.

680
00:40:36,572 --> 00:40:37,656
Lodge Residence.

681
00:40:38,908 --> 00:40:40,451
I'm so sorry to hear that.

682
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:45,247
Of course, all our
prayers. Thank you, Andre.

683
00:40:49,543 --> 00:40:51,336
Everything all right, mi vida?

684
00:40:53,381 --> 00:40:56,050
The St. Clairs had a car accident.

685
00:40:56,926 --> 00:40:58,552
They were run off the road.

686
00:40:59,804 --> 00:41:05,101
Nick... he will recover, but
it's gonna take several months.

687
00:41:06,018 --> 00:41:07,186
Oh, well.

688
00:41:10,069 --> 00:41:11,399
