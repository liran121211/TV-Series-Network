1
00:00:01,073 --> 00:00:02,502
Previously on Riverdale...

2
00:00:02,505 --> 00:00:03,879
My dad was the Black Hood.

3
00:00:03,882 --> 00:00:05,174
He tried to shoot my dad again.

4
00:00:05,177 --> 00:00:07,124
That's impossible, he was here with us.

5
00:00:07,127 --> 00:00:09,398
I rearranged Nick St. Clair's
pretty-boy face for him.

6
00:00:09,401 --> 00:00:11,482
And when some hillbilly
threatened Mr. Lodge's daughter,

7
00:00:11,484 --> 00:00:12,807
I did the same thing to him, too.

8
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,117
- Andre.
- I'll take it from here.

9
00:00:15,011 --> 00:00:17,552
The fire's started, mi
amor. Chaos is good for us.

10
00:00:17,555 --> 00:00:19,041
A new Sheriff's taken over for Keller,

11
00:00:19,043 --> 00:00:20,984
a man I know very well, Michael Minetta.

12
00:00:20,987 --> 00:00:22,937
For all of Mr. Lodge's
talk about law and order,

13
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,107
he was nowhere to be seen tonight.

14
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:25,901
Don't try to get between me and my dad.

15
00:00:25,904 --> 00:00:27,231
That is a battle you will lose.

16
00:00:27,234 --> 00:00:29,059
This is from when I
turned the tables on Nick.

17
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:31,020
His parents gave me a cool million.

18
00:00:31,023 --> 00:00:34,419
I put it in a trust that you
won't touch until you're 21.

19
00:00:34,422 --> 00:00:36,067
So you paid the Ghoulies

20
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,308
and Penny to go to
war with the Serpents.

21
00:00:38,311 --> 00:00:39,586
How much is this costing you?

22
00:00:39,589 --> 00:00:40,805
'Cause I have a counter offer.

23
00:00:40,808 --> 00:00:43,459
I hand myself over to you tonight
and there's no bloodshed tomorrow.

24
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:45,762
You're a true hero, Jughead.

25
00:00:45,765 --> 00:00:49,648
Let your dying thought be that
your sacrifice was for nothing.

26
00:01:07,194 --> 00:01:08,844
Come back to me, Jug.

27
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,911
We're not done yet, do you hear me?

28
00:01:12,914 --> 00:01:16,187
Our story's not over.
It's just beginning.

29
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,211
So you come back to me.

30
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:22,026
Okay?

31
00:01:26,432 --> 00:01:28,102
Dad?

32
00:01:33,339 --> 00:01:34,638
Jug.

33
00:01:36,108 --> 00:01:37,786
What did I miss?

34
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:41,745
What you did brought every Serpent
I've ever known out of the woodwork

35
00:01:41,748 --> 00:01:43,571
and you would've been proud of 'em, boy.

36
00:01:44,677 --> 00:01:47,985
It looked like we were gonna win the
day, but in the end there were just...

37
00:01:47,988 --> 00:01:49,920
just too many Ghoulies.

38
00:01:51,224 --> 00:01:53,616
It was like shooting snakes in a barrel.

39
00:01:53,619 --> 00:01:54,985
Why?

40
00:01:56,654 --> 00:01:57,886
Why did you go?

41
00:01:57,889 --> 00:01:59,227
I wanted to avenge you.

42
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,879
I had an agreement with Hiram Lodge.

43
00:02:00,882 --> 00:02:02,797
There was no stopping the others.

44
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,071
They were churned up
about you and Fangs.

45
00:02:05,074 --> 00:02:06,769
Even though Fangs is...

46
00:02:06,772 --> 00:02:08,071
He's alive.

47
00:02:08,074 --> 00:02:09,241
Fangs is alive?

48
00:02:12,044 --> 00:02:13,444
But I thought...

49
00:02:13,447 --> 00:02:16,037
A deputy called you and
told you he was dead.

50
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,339
Yeah, that was a lie.

51
00:02:17,342 --> 00:02:19,293
A ploy, you mean.

52
00:02:19,296 --> 00:02:22,226
To goad the Serpents into
a fight they couldn't win.

53
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:25,983
All of riot night was a Hiram
Lodge orchestrated mousetrap.

54
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,961
And the Serpents
followed me right into it.

55
00:02:30,964 --> 00:02:33,304
Sunnyside Trailer Park fell,

56
00:02:33,307 --> 00:02:36,163
and while our trailer's still
standing, most of them burned.

57
00:02:40,806 --> 00:02:43,218
Jug, after the rumble,

58
00:02:43,221 --> 00:02:45,582
some of the Serpents defected, they...

59
00:02:45,585 --> 00:02:48,379
They joined the Ghoulies,
others were arrested.

60
00:02:48,382 --> 00:02:50,624
More went into hiding, the rest, they...

61
00:02:52,285 --> 00:02:53,550
They left town.

62
00:02:55,588 --> 00:02:57,843
The Serpents,

63
00:02:57,846 --> 00:02:59,480
they don't exist anymore.

64
00:02:59,483 --> 00:03:00,858
We had our time.

65
00:03:00,861 --> 00:03:03,225
Nothing for you to do but to get better.

66
00:03:03,228 --> 00:03:04,736
And to be there for Betty.

67
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:06,038
Betty?

68
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,566
What happened with Betty?

69
00:03:13,205 --> 00:03:15,639
I'm so sorry that I
wasn't there for you,

70
00:03:18,177 --> 00:03:19,976
to help with your dad.

71
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:21,545
No, Jug.

72
00:03:24,517 --> 00:03:26,183
I never want to see him again.

73
00:03:30,623 --> 00:03:33,546
Right now, all I care about is you,

74
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:35,816
and taking care of my mom.

75
00:03:39,565 --> 00:03:42,632
And figuring out how to...

76
00:03:42,635 --> 00:03:46,236
atone for all of the
horrible things my father did.

77
00:03:49,141 --> 00:03:52,671
So I guess we won't be running
for student council anymore, huh?

78
00:03:52,674 --> 00:03:54,725
Probably not.

79
00:04:02,386 --> 00:04:05,321
Here's your schedule for the
next three days, Mr. Andrews.

80
00:04:05,324 --> 00:04:09,699
My mom's doing an Eva
Peron-like rainbow tour.

81
00:04:09,702 --> 00:04:12,589
Shaking the trees one last
time before election night.

82
00:04:12,592 --> 00:04:15,761
I took the liberty of
booking you right behind her,

83
00:04:15,764 --> 00:04:17,808
so that people know they have a choice.

84
00:04:17,811 --> 00:04:21,847
Well, I... I appreciate that,
Veronica, for what it's worth, but...

85
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,691
Everybody's already saying that your

86
00:04:23,694 --> 00:04:26,110
parents saved Riverdale after the riot,

87
00:04:26,113 --> 00:04:29,204
that it was their guy,
Minetta, who put out the fires

88
00:04:29,207 --> 00:04:30,774
and rounded up the guilty parties.

89
00:04:30,777 --> 00:04:32,449
We know the truth, Dad,

90
00:04:32,452 --> 00:04:35,319
that Mr. Lodge doesn't want to save
the town, he wants to take it over.

91
00:04:35,321 --> 00:04:38,800
Luckily, I won't rest until
you're elected mayor, Mr. Andrews.

92
00:04:38,803 --> 00:04:42,761
Even if it means I have to put
my own political missions aside.

93
00:04:42,764 --> 00:04:44,300
In what respect?

94
00:04:44,303 --> 00:04:47,034
I'm no longer running for
student council with Archie.

95
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:50,767
Conspiring against my parents
is proving to be a full-time job.

96
00:04:55,274 --> 00:04:57,117
Hey, Eddie, any news?

97
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,076
I'll be out of here
first thing tomorrow.

98
00:04:59,078 --> 00:05:00,652
That's good, Jug.

99
00:05:00,655 --> 00:05:02,808
Because we still need your brain.

100
00:05:02,811 --> 00:05:04,449
There's another mystery to solve.

101
00:05:05,885 --> 00:05:08,252
Mr. Cooper was at the town hall

102
00:05:08,255 --> 00:05:10,508
when some other Black Hood
took shots at the candidates.

103
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:12,756
And he was at home with
Betty and Mrs. Cooper

104
00:05:12,758 --> 00:05:13,957
when another Black Hood,

105
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:16,026
probably the same as
the one at the town hall,

106
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:17,784
came after me and my dad. So...

107
00:05:17,787 --> 00:05:19,395
Well, a second Black Hood's attacks

108
00:05:19,398 --> 00:05:20,764
at the town hall and on your dad

109
00:05:20,766 --> 00:05:23,011
seem to indicate a political motive.

110
00:05:23,014 --> 00:05:25,347
Which to me suggests...

111
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,066
That my father's behind them?

112
00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:28,339
I don't n'sagree.

113
00:05:28,342 --> 00:05:29,745
With Fred out of the way,

114
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,126
my mother's path to victory
is that much more assured.

115
00:05:32,128 --> 00:05:34,503
So, if we're gonna stop
Hiram, we've got to do it now.

116
00:05:34,506 --> 00:05:38,088
Once the Lodges are in control of the
mayor's office, they'll be untouchable.

117
00:05:38,091 --> 00:05:40,250
Yeah, but do you think Hiram
would really put on a black hood

118
00:05:40,252 --> 00:05:42,047
and start shooting at
people for a mayorship?

119
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,551
No. But he would hire someone to do it.

120
00:05:44,554 --> 00:05:46,387
We were thinking it
could be a Serpent, Jug.

121
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,988
Or a Ghoulie.

122
00:05:47,991 --> 00:05:50,386
Or, even more insidiously,

123
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:53,923
the man that Hiram put in charge
of restoring peace and harmony.

124
00:05:53,926 --> 00:05:55,644
- Sheriff Minetta.
- He was supposedly

125
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:57,534
guarding the town hall,
but no one saw him.

126
00:05:57,536 --> 00:05:59,318
And he was MIA most of the riot night.

127
00:05:59,321 --> 00:06:01,020
- Let's start there.
- Will do.

128
00:06:01,023 --> 00:06:03,613
I have to go down to the
sheriff's station tomorrow anyway.

129
00:06:03,616 --> 00:06:04,708
Why, Arch?

130
00:06:05,862 --> 00:06:08,596
I have to identify your dad, Betty.

131
00:06:13,285 --> 00:06:15,225
And with that, it's official.

132
00:06:15,228 --> 00:06:16,855
Congratulations.

133
00:06:16,858 --> 00:06:19,323
With Nana Blossom as my legal guardian,

134
00:06:19,326 --> 00:06:20,824
and I as her youthful ward,

135
00:06:20,826 --> 00:06:22,426
Mummy and Uncle Claudius' stranglehold

136
00:06:22,428 --> 00:06:24,795
on my life and happiness
has at last ended.

137
00:06:24,797 --> 00:06:26,096
I will file the papers

138
00:06:26,098 --> 00:06:28,691
and send this letter of
separation to your mother.

139
00:06:28,694 --> 00:06:32,159
Oh. No need. She and my odious
uncle are still on the estate,

140
00:06:32,162 --> 00:06:35,475
living in one of the barns. I'll
happily deliver this missive in person.

141
00:06:46,452 --> 00:06:47,851
First things first...

142
00:07:11,623 --> 00:07:14,287
Yeah, that's right! He lived here,

143
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:17,058
the Black Hood! Come closer,
do you want to come in?

144
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:20,076
Do you want to see where he
planned all of his murders?

145
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:22,619
- Do you want to see where he ate, where he slept?
- Get out of here! Go!

146
00:07:22,621 --> 00:07:24,541
- The front door is wide open!
- Go home!

147
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,545
- Turn off your cameras. Go home.
- Come closer!

148
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:27,667
Hey! Leave us alone.

149
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,726
- Do you want to come see the Black Hood's lair?
- Go! Go home!

150
00:07:29,728 --> 00:07:33,163
Abandon all hope ye who enter here.

152
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:44,944
You know, I don't have to go back
to school today, I could come over.

153
00:07:44,947 --> 00:07:47,865
I'm not sure my mom's
up for company, Jug.

154
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:51,061
At least not until the
lookie-loos move on.

155
00:07:51,064 --> 00:07:52,286
I'm worried about you.

156
00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:53,683
I know.

157
00:07:53,686 --> 00:07:55,428
Me too.

158
00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:57,475
My mom and I...

159
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:00,647
We'll just have to get
through it, and we will.

160
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:03,998
Okay.

161
00:08:04,001 --> 00:08:05,266
But if you need anything...

162
00:08:05,268 --> 00:08:06,434
I'll call you.

163
00:08:07,147 --> 00:08:08,246
I love you.

164
00:08:08,249 --> 00:08:09,282
I love you, too.

165
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,478
Ready to do this?

166
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,252
We're set here.

167
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:32,318
Archie, can you identify the
man sitting at that table?

168
00:08:32,321 --> 00:08:34,450
That's Hal Cooper,

169
00:08:34,453 --> 00:08:35,819
my neighbor.

170
00:08:38,334 --> 00:08:40,601
The man who shot my dad at Pop's diner.

171
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:43,537
He's one

172
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,589
of the Black Hoods.

173
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:47,959
A lot of people took
advantage of riot night.

174
00:08:47,962 --> 00:08:51,115
We had multiple reports of
looters wearing black ski masks.

175
00:08:51,118 --> 00:08:52,983
The man at my house
wasn't a looter, Sheriff,

176
00:08:52,986 --> 00:08:54,475
he was there to murder my father.

177
00:08:58,354 --> 00:09:00,444
You may not be taking this seriously

178
00:09:00,447 --> 00:09:02,365
but I am.

179
00:09:02,368 --> 00:09:04,025
I'm not gonna let this go.

180
00:09:04,028 --> 00:09:05,686
Make sure your boss knows that.

181
00:09:08,231 --> 00:09:10,298
What can I do for you, Betty?

182
00:09:12,127 --> 00:09:15,461
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry, Mr. Andrews.

183
00:09:16,539 --> 00:09:19,640
You have nothing to
apologize for, Betty.

184
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:21,761
You didn't do anything wrong.

185
00:09:21,764 --> 00:09:23,678
I'm supposed to be this...

186
00:09:25,348 --> 00:09:27,048
great detective,

187
00:09:28,714 --> 00:09:31,615
but I didn't see what
was right in front of me.

188
00:09:35,391 --> 00:09:39,160
And people paid for that
mistake with their lives.

189
00:09:45,162 --> 00:09:46,734
Moose, you okay?

190
00:09:53,344 --> 00:09:55,529
All of her stuff is gone.

191
00:09:55,532 --> 00:09:58,613
- Whose stuff?
- Midge's locker was trashed in the riot.

192
00:09:58,615 --> 00:10:01,015
And... All the notes people left her,

193
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,561
and her books, and her stuffed animals,

194
00:10:03,564 --> 00:10:05,498
it's all gone.

195
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,556
It's just things, okay?

196
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:10,625
You're gonna be okay, Moose.

197
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,670
What do you mean you're
withdrawing from the race?

198
00:10:28,673 --> 00:10:29,881
It's clear.

199
00:10:29,884 --> 00:10:33,819
Reggie Mantle is not ready
to be a leader of men.

200
00:10:33,822 --> 00:10:37,920
And my mom and I had a big
talk after the riots, and...

201
00:10:37,923 --> 00:10:40,764
I am an artist, not a politician.

202
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,928
I need to get back to what I'm best at.

203
00:10:42,931 --> 00:10:44,100
Music.

204
00:10:45,037 --> 00:10:46,360
And then there was one.

205
00:10:46,362 --> 00:10:49,279
Well, don't forget about Ethel Muggs,

206
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:52,069
who's running as a
third-party candidate.

207
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,269
So this is how it ends, huh?

208
00:10:55,272 --> 00:10:58,459
Not with a whimper, but
with a memo from Weatherbee.

209
00:10:58,462 --> 00:11:01,730
Riverdale High is now
suddenly overcrowded.

210
00:11:01,733 --> 00:11:04,078
So, starting next week, all
former Southside High students

211
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,814
will be bussed to Seaside High,

212
00:11:05,817 --> 00:11:08,076
- which is two hours away.
- Meaning,

213
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,717
he blames us for trashing
the school during riot night.

214
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,959
Well, to be fair, Sweet Pea,

215
00:11:12,962 --> 00:11:14,381
you did.

216
00:11:18,131 --> 00:11:19,627
What's our play, Jones?

217
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:20,828
Do we have one?

218
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,053
I don't know anymore, guys.

219
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,522
I can't keep fighting for
a gang that doesn't exist.

220
00:11:24,525 --> 00:11:26,033
Well, what about us?

221
00:11:26,035 --> 00:11:27,990
Or any of the other
Serpents at the Wyrm?

222
00:11:29,138 --> 00:11:30,938
What Serpents at the Wyrm?

223
00:11:31,975 --> 00:11:34,041
Buenos dias, Veronica.

224
00:11:34,044 --> 00:11:36,077
I thought you'd wanna know

225
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,145
I saw your strapping,
conquistador father

226
00:11:38,148 --> 00:11:40,848
holding a summit with
Mummy and Uncle Claudius

227
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:43,517
at one of Thornhill's
barns of all places.

228
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,586
It looked like collusion to me.

229
00:11:46,576 --> 00:11:48,292
Daddykins, care to comment

230
00:11:48,295 --> 00:11:50,925
on the rumors that you've
been having secret meetings

231
00:11:50,928 --> 00:11:53,627
with Claudius and Penelope
Blossom in their barn?

232
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:57,465
Certainly. I'm looking to
diversify Lodge Industries' holdings

233
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,498
by possibly getting
into the maple trade.

234
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:00,787
I see.

235
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:04,365
So, it's not that you enlisted
Claudius to impersonate the Black Hood

236
00:12:04,368 --> 00:12:06,448
and take potshots at Mom
during the town hall debate?

237
00:12:06,451 --> 00:12:07,695
Veronica, have you lost your mind?

238
00:12:07,697 --> 00:12:09,945
Your imagination is getting
the better of you, Veronica.

239
00:12:09,948 --> 00:12:11,348
Maybe.

240
00:12:11,351 --> 00:12:12,967
Maybe not.

241
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,400
But I don't think any of us in this room

242
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,592
can deny that it's not at least possible

243
00:12:17,595 --> 00:12:20,107
that you'd put Mom in the crosshairs

244
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:23,287
to pursue some personal
political agenda.

245
00:12:42,764 --> 00:12:44,011
I don't understand.

246
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:46,334
You saw what the Ghoulies
did to most of Sunnyside.

247
00:12:46,337 --> 00:12:48,417
A lot of Serpents couldn't
afford to leave Riverdale.

248
00:12:49,614 --> 00:12:50,880
So we came here.

249
00:12:52,221 --> 00:12:53,888
Does my dad know about this?

250
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:58,772
You should come back to school,

251
00:12:58,775 --> 00:13:00,873
- be with us.
- No, how can I, you guys?

252
00:13:00,876 --> 00:13:03,092
You can't carry this weight on your own.

253
00:13:03,095 --> 00:13:04,467
Veronica is right, Betty.

254
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,795
My dad killed Midge,

255
00:13:06,798 --> 00:13:08,268
he shot Moose.

256
00:13:08,271 --> 00:13:10,337
How am I supposed to
show my face there again?

257
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,694
Do you hate him...

258
00:13:15,697 --> 00:13:17,842
for what he did to your dad?

259
00:13:17,845 --> 00:13:19,213
Because I do.

260
00:13:20,514 --> 00:13:23,182
I hate my father.

261
00:13:38,701 --> 00:13:40,401
Since when are you drinking again, Dad?

262
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:44,967
Oh, I am celebrating the fact that
I'm no longer Hiram Lodge's busboy.

263
00:13:46,142 --> 00:13:49,977
He fired me from Pop's
today. He's cleaning house.

264
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,764
Getting rid of the stragglers.

265
00:13:51,767 --> 00:13:53,380
- Well, he's a bastard.
- Yeah.

266
00:13:53,382 --> 00:13:54,915
Who cares? We have work to do.

267
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,662
Why'd you lie to me?

268
00:13:56,665 --> 00:13:58,678
You told me the Serpents don't exist.

269
00:13:58,681 --> 00:14:00,215
They're at the Whyte Wyrm
and they need our help.

270
00:14:00,217 --> 00:14:03,037
No, what they need is to cut bait,

271
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,824
get out while they still can.

272
00:14:04,827 --> 00:14:08,462
Now, I wasn't lying when I
said that it was over, Jug.

273
00:14:08,464 --> 00:14:09,858
Well, it is time, boy.

274
00:14:09,861 --> 00:14:11,265
What are you talking about?

275
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,319
It is time to skip town.

276
00:14:13,322 --> 00:14:14,600
I'm not going anywhere.

277
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,084
You bet your ass you are.

278
00:14:16,087 --> 00:14:17,204
Toledo.

279
00:14:17,206 --> 00:14:18,350
I already told your mom.

280
00:14:18,353 --> 00:14:19,787
No, I'm not leaving Betty.

281
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,936
We are not abandoning the Serpents.

282
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:30,498
I will not be standing over a
body bag with you zipped up in it.

283
00:14:30,501 --> 00:14:32,319
We're moving to Toledo.

284
00:14:32,321 --> 00:14:33,687
But pack light,

285
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:35,811
we're only taking the bikes.

286
00:14:45,562 --> 00:14:48,022
Do you think we have a shot, Mrs. McCoy?

287
00:14:48,025 --> 00:14:51,787
Elections are won and
lost in these two days.

288
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,085
In my opinion, Fred,

289
00:14:53,088 --> 00:14:55,521
your key to victory
is the Southside vote.

290
00:14:55,524 --> 00:14:58,836
Historically, Southsiders don't
vote because they feel marginalized.

291
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:01,073
But if you can get them to the booths,

292
00:15:01,075 --> 00:15:03,380
they'll be voting for
you and not Hermione.

293
00:15:03,383 --> 00:15:05,927
Sorry to interrupt, uh,
Sheriff Minetta is on the phone,

294
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,129
says it's urgent.

295
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,883
After your visit, Archie, I
made it my personal mission

296
00:15:10,885 --> 00:15:13,385
to catch the man who invaded your home.

297
00:15:14,555 --> 00:15:16,021
An anonymous tip

298
00:15:16,023 --> 00:15:18,857
led to the suspect, and when
we went to question him...

299
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,887
Well, unfortunately, he
engaged us in a firefight,

300
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:24,326
and we were forced to take him down.

301
00:15:24,329 --> 00:15:28,083
He's dead, but he's
the guy, no question.

302
00:15:28,086 --> 00:15:29,601
How can you be so sure?

303
00:15:29,604 --> 00:15:32,070
We found guns on the
premises that matched the ones

304
00:15:32,073 --> 00:15:35,599
used at both the attack on your
house and the town hall shooting,

305
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,935
as well as this black hood.

306
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,923
Who was he?

307
00:15:41,926 --> 00:15:44,974
Ex-gang member, Gerald Petite.

308
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:46,685
Also known as "Tall Boy."

309
00:15:49,107 --> 00:15:51,441
What do you mean you haven't
gone to visit Dad yet?

310
00:15:51,444 --> 00:15:54,279
We're taking things one
step at a time, Polly.

311
00:15:54,282 --> 00:15:57,833
But if we don't go visit him, how are
we supposed to be able to forgive him?

312
00:15:57,836 --> 00:15:59,719
What the hell are you talking about?

313
00:15:59,722 --> 00:16:01,016
Betty, at the farm they taught us

314
00:16:01,018 --> 00:16:03,443
that forgiveness is the most
valuable gift we can give.

315
00:16:03,446 --> 00:16:06,388
If we don't absolve him,
we'll become what he was,

316
00:16:06,391 --> 00:16:07,590
full of hate.

317
00:16:07,593 --> 00:16:10,232
And my babies deserve a
mother who's better than that.

318
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:11,779
Maybe Polly's right.

319
00:16:11,782 --> 00:16:14,763
I mean, not about forgiving
him, but about seeing him.

320
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:15,781
No.

321
00:16:15,784 --> 00:16:17,116
Maybe that way,

322
00:16:17,119 --> 00:16:20,349
we can get some answers or I
can give him a piece of my mind.

323
00:16:20,352 --> 00:16:22,315
If that's what you want, Mom.

324
00:16:22,318 --> 00:16:23,794
But you two can count me out.

325
00:16:30,264 --> 00:16:32,431
You were right, Veronica.

326
00:16:32,433 --> 00:16:33,799
It's conceivable

327
00:16:33,802 --> 00:16:36,396
that your father was behind
the attack at town hall.

328
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,107
And it made me think...

329
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,609
that we, or at least you, should
have a contingency in place.

330
00:16:43,612 --> 00:16:45,978
There is a bit of leverage

331
00:16:45,981 --> 00:16:49,536
that, should you acquire it, would
give you power over your father.

332
00:16:49,539 --> 00:16:51,630
That's music to my ears, Mom.

333
00:16:52,659 --> 00:16:56,327
Your father's plans for the
Southside go far beyond the prison.

334
00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:00,404
He wants to consolidate
the entire area into...

335
00:17:00,407 --> 00:17:01,693
something.

336
00:17:02,497 --> 00:17:06,532
But there's one critical piece of
the Southside that he doesn't own yet,

337
00:17:06,535 --> 00:17:09,635
that's keeping his takeover
from being complete.

338
00:17:09,637 --> 00:17:12,504
Though, he's in the middle of
negotiations with the proprietor.

339
00:17:12,506 --> 00:17:13,955
What's the name of the spot?

340
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:15,474
The Whyte Wyrm.

341
00:17:17,044 --> 00:17:20,310
You'll need money to
block him, of course.

342
00:17:20,313 --> 00:17:22,333
But that should be easy enough to get.

343
00:17:24,066 --> 00:17:26,150
Daddy, Attorney McCoy

344
00:17:26,153 --> 00:17:29,880
is representing me in regards to that
million dollars you plundered from me.

345
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:31,951
My client would like it back.

346
00:17:31,954 --> 00:17:33,959
That money's in a trust.

347
00:17:33,962 --> 00:17:35,452
I'm looking out for her future.

348
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:38,036
Of course. And I'm
looking out for yours.

349
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:41,888
The election's in two days and
you still want Mom to win, right?

350
00:17:41,891 --> 00:17:44,427
Well, if you don't release my funds,

351
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,904
I'll start telling your secrets, Daddy.

352
00:17:46,907 --> 00:17:49,408
The fake Black Hood attacks,
Papa Poutine's murder,

353
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,935
the crippling of Nick St. Clair.

354
00:17:50,938 --> 00:17:52,377
And I won't stop

355
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,990
until all your dirty laundry is exposed.

356
00:17:55,993 --> 00:18:00,201
Or, of course, you could simply give
my client what's rightfully hers.

357
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,460
Of course it's Tall Boy.

358
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:09,962
I'm such an idiot.

359
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,771
You think what Minetta said is true?

360
00:18:11,774 --> 00:18:13,287
That Tall Boy was the second Black Hood?

361
00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:15,419
He's done Hiram's dirty work before.

362
00:18:15,422 --> 00:18:17,576
He confessed to it, which,
now that I think about it,

363
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:20,083
explains why he died
suddenly in a firefight.

364
00:18:20,086 --> 00:18:21,309
There's no loose ends.

365
00:18:21,312 --> 00:18:22,839
He can't implicate Hiram, ever.

366
00:18:22,842 --> 00:18:23,794
And now Sheriff Minetta

367
00:18:23,797 --> 00:18:25,844
can say the case of the
copycat Black Hood is closed.

368
00:18:25,846 --> 00:18:27,182
Hiram is gonna get away with it.

369
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,549
He's gonna get away with all of it.

370
00:18:36,136 --> 00:18:38,670
Nana Rose, Cheryl?

371
00:18:38,673 --> 00:18:39,990
You really think that

372
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:43,958
that senile crone would be a better
guardian than your own mother?

373
00:18:43,961 --> 00:18:45,963
Oh, Mumsy.

374
00:18:45,966 --> 00:18:47,399
Enough.

375
00:18:47,402 --> 00:18:49,630
I'm off to deliver some
nibbles to ma cherie

376
00:18:49,633 --> 00:18:51,265
and her chums at the Whyte Wyrm.

377
00:18:51,268 --> 00:18:52,865
Cheryl, no!

378
00:18:52,868 --> 00:18:55,073
You can't go there.

379
00:18:55,076 --> 00:18:56,619
Not tonight.

380
00:18:56,622 --> 00:18:59,378
And why, pray tell, not?

381
00:19:02,283 --> 00:19:04,615
And on top of everything else, my dad,

382
00:19:04,618 --> 00:19:07,115
who's drinking again,
wants us to move to Toledo.

383
00:19:07,118 --> 00:19:08,208
Just in time, too.

384
00:19:08,211 --> 00:19:11,859
'Cause Weatherbee wants to kick all
the Southsiders out of Riverdale High.

385
00:19:11,862 --> 00:19:13,778
- Cheryl?
- Zip it and listen.

386
00:19:13,781 --> 00:19:15,162
We have to get to the Whyte Wyrm ASAP.

387
00:19:15,164 --> 00:19:16,448
I've already called Toni
to give her the heads-up.

388
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:17,631
- What's going on?
- My mumsy warned me

389
00:19:17,633 --> 00:19:20,332
that Hiram Lodge's cyborg Sheriff
is raiding your precious bar tonight.

390
00:19:20,334 --> 00:19:22,827
And if things turn violent
and some Serpents end up shot,

391
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,310
well, so much the better.

392
00:19:24,313 --> 00:19:26,400
Let's go.

393
00:19:26,403 --> 00:19:28,529
Take only what you absolutely need,

394
00:19:28,532 --> 00:19:30,005
and what you can carry with you.

395
00:19:30,013 --> 00:19:32,088
We need to move quickly and quietly.

396
00:19:32,091 --> 00:19:34,779
Sheriff Minetta's forces
are all over the Southside

397
00:19:34,782 --> 00:19:36,294
and they're looking for our blood.

398
00:19:36,297 --> 00:19:39,185
If we want our skulls
to remain uncracked,

399
00:19:39,188 --> 00:19:40,885
we have to go undetected.

400
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:43,021
Go where? There's nowhere safe.

401
00:19:43,024 --> 00:19:45,568
We've been offered
asylum on the Northside.

402
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,882
Come on, Jug.

403
00:20:43,885 --> 00:20:45,118
Don't look back.

404
00:21:02,651 --> 00:21:03,894
A good boy.

405
00:21:03,897 --> 00:21:06,319
All right. Two dots and a dash.

406
00:21:06,322 --> 00:21:08,589
Two chicks on a raft here, Jug.

407
00:21:08,592 --> 00:21:10,952
And there's a stack
of Vermont hot for ya.

408
00:21:10,955 --> 00:21:13,139
Oh, yeah, I worked at
Pop's for a summer. Come on.

409
00:21:13,142 --> 00:21:14,420
What's going on here?

410
00:21:16,831 --> 00:21:18,823
You do all this?

411
00:21:18,826 --> 00:21:20,759
With an assist from Archie.

412
00:21:21,827 --> 00:21:23,616
Toledo's gonna have to wait.

413
00:21:25,774 --> 00:21:27,306
Maybe so.

414
00:21:27,309 --> 00:21:29,245
Bulldogs helping Serpents,

415
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,611
Freddie Andrews opening his
house to a bunch of snakes.

416
00:21:31,613 --> 00:21:34,347
There goes the rest of
your Northside boat, buddy.

417
00:21:34,349 --> 00:21:35,682
We're all neighbors here.

418
00:21:35,685 --> 00:21:37,083
All right. Bacon!

419
00:21:38,553 --> 00:21:40,853
Hey. Thank you.

420
00:21:40,856 --> 00:21:42,488
You came through for me.

421
00:21:46,628 --> 00:21:47,756
I'm not done yet.

422
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:50,159
How many of these Serpent jackets
do you think we can borrow?

423
00:21:55,883 --> 00:21:58,049
Please have this faxed
to the superintendent.

424
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,686
What's the meaning of this?

425
00:22:10,689 --> 00:22:12,561
It's a show of support, sir.

426
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:14,286
For the Southsiders who are being

427
00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:17,061
wrongly transferred out of our school.

428
00:22:17,064 --> 00:22:19,975
Everyone's ready to walk
out, Principal Weatherbee.

429
00:22:19,978 --> 00:22:22,342
Any student who walks out

430
00:22:22,345 --> 00:22:24,811
better keep walking,
because they'll be expelled.

431
00:22:24,814 --> 00:22:26,101
You're a good man, Principal Weatherbee.

432
00:22:26,103 --> 00:22:28,608
You're not the kind of
person who discriminates.

433
00:22:28,611 --> 00:22:30,788
And if you are, then expel me.

434
00:22:32,006 --> 00:22:33,973
Because I don't want
to be a part of that.

435
00:22:38,999 --> 00:22:40,467
Everyone,

436
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:41,714
get to class.

437
00:22:47,922 --> 00:22:49,756
That jacket looks good on you.

438
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:52,420
Everything looks good on me.

439
00:22:52,423 --> 00:22:54,819
Well, maybe we should make it official.

440
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:00,370
Jughead, come here.

441
00:23:02,719 --> 00:23:04,452
I have insider information

442
00:23:04,455 --> 00:23:08,280
that my father is making a
play to buy the Whyte Wyrm.

443
00:23:08,283 --> 00:23:10,577
Along with him firing my dad from Pop's.

444
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,272
What?

445
00:23:12,275 --> 00:23:14,080
- He did that?
- Yeah.

446
00:23:14,082 --> 00:23:15,952
I won't be eating there anymore.

447
00:23:15,955 --> 00:23:17,428
Wait, Jughead.

448
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:20,219
I was gonna make a play to buy the Wyrm

449
00:23:20,221 --> 00:23:23,374
in order to torpedo Daddy's
monopolizing of the Southside,

450
00:23:23,377 --> 00:23:28,381
but now I'm thinking there's
a better, smarter play here.

451
00:23:28,384 --> 00:23:31,749
If you trust me, and we move fast.

452
00:23:33,968 --> 00:23:35,968
Hello. Hog Eye?

453
00:23:38,608 --> 00:23:39,939
Daddy.

454
00:23:41,376 --> 00:23:44,210
Welcome to the bar I bought
from Mr. Hoggins two hours ago.

455
00:23:46,381 --> 00:23:47,680
Here's the deed,

456
00:23:47,683 --> 00:23:50,170
looked over by my
attorney, Sierra McCoy.

457
00:23:51,769 --> 00:23:53,736
All legal, of course.

458
00:23:55,890 --> 00:24:00,249
But... I'm willing to
sell the Whyte Wyrm to you.

459
00:24:00,252 --> 00:24:02,495
Or, rather, trade it.

460
00:24:03,898 --> 00:24:07,400
In exchange for Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe.

461
00:24:10,805 --> 00:24:12,872
How did you even know
I was after the Wyrm?

462
00:24:14,275 --> 00:24:16,579
It was the hot gossip
amongst all the Serpents

463
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,514
who escaped to Fred Andrews' house

464
00:24:18,517 --> 00:24:20,678
the night of your misbegotten raid.

465
00:24:20,681 --> 00:24:23,241
You're risking war with me over Pop's?

466
00:24:23,244 --> 00:24:25,749
- Why?
- Because I realized,

467
00:24:25,752 --> 00:24:30,022
once I learned how you so
callously fired Mr. Jones,

468
00:24:31,057 --> 00:24:34,609
that Pop's is one of the
only places left in this town

469
00:24:34,612 --> 00:24:37,246
that my friends and I can call our own.

470
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:40,866
I'm looking for an even trade here.

471
00:24:44,706 --> 00:24:46,038
You want to barter?

472
00:24:48,376 --> 00:24:49,743
Let's barter.

473
00:24:50,741 --> 00:24:54,545
But to be clear, if I make
this deal with you, that's it.

474
00:24:54,548 --> 00:24:56,655
That's the last thing
you'll ever get from me.

475
00:24:56,658 --> 00:25:00,772
No more allowance, no more
trust fund, no more credit cards.

476
00:25:00,775 --> 00:25:05,061
You'll also sign over your
third of Lodge Industries to me.

477
00:25:05,064 --> 00:25:06,964
You'll relinquish your vote,

478
00:25:06,967 --> 00:25:08,506
your seat on the board,

479
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:09,775
your legacy.

480
00:25:17,739 --> 00:25:19,105
Fine.

481
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:21,752
That's all blood money anyway.

482
00:25:23,531 --> 00:25:24,897
Jug...

483
00:25:28,283 --> 00:25:31,050
Do you think evil can be passed on?

484
00:25:32,845 --> 00:25:34,100
Betty.

485
00:25:36,891 --> 00:25:39,091
My great-grandfather had it,

486
00:25:39,094 --> 00:25:42,163
my grandfather, my
father, they were all...

487
00:25:43,702 --> 00:25:45,335
murderers, Jug.

488
00:25:45,338 --> 00:25:47,734
- That's just circumstance.
- Is it?

489
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:50,280
Or is it possible that this baby

490
00:25:50,283 --> 00:25:53,225
is gonna grow up to be
a monster like my father?

491
00:25:53,228 --> 00:25:54,540
Or like me.

492
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:57,076
That's easy.

493
00:25:58,947 --> 00:26:00,313
No.

494
00:26:00,316 --> 00:26:02,148
That baby is not evil.

495
00:26:02,151 --> 00:26:03,270
And neither are you.

496
00:26:03,273 --> 00:26:05,139
What if it's my...

497
00:26:05,142 --> 00:26:07,398
My destiny, my birthright?

498
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,960
Something I'll never be able
to control or understand?

499
00:26:09,963 --> 00:26:10,975
Hey.

500
00:26:10,978 --> 00:26:12,741
Look at me.

501
00:26:12,744 --> 00:26:14,427
I know you.

502
00:26:18,099 --> 00:26:20,166
You're a good person, Betty.

503
00:26:20,169 --> 00:26:21,928
You might have some darkness,

504
00:26:21,931 --> 00:26:23,780
just like me...

505
00:26:23,783 --> 00:26:25,283
But you're not evil.

506
00:26:29,131 --> 00:26:30,830
Do you believe that?

507
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,749
Do you believe me?

508
00:26:40,506 --> 00:26:41,654
Yeah.

509
00:27:05,128 --> 00:27:06,794
Think you'll eke it out, Arch?

510
00:27:08,297 --> 00:27:11,865
Uh, to be honest, Jug, mine's not
the election I'm worried about.

511
00:27:11,868 --> 00:27:13,534
In the meantime,

512
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:16,470
Betty is voting for you through me,

513
00:27:16,473 --> 00:27:17,938
by proxy.

514
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,939
How's she doing?

515
00:27:19,942 --> 00:27:21,242
You know...

516
00:27:22,011 --> 00:27:23,978
I think she's gonna be okay.

517
00:27:24,981 --> 00:27:28,482
I told myself I wasn't
going to see you again.

518
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,352
Really?

519
00:27:32,478 --> 00:27:35,288
I never doubted for a moment you'd come.

520
00:27:35,291 --> 00:27:37,792
You're the only one who understands me,

521
00:27:39,462 --> 00:27:40,828
that's like me.

522
00:27:42,098 --> 00:27:43,597
You did...

523
00:27:45,535 --> 00:27:47,234
unspeakable,

524
00:27:48,571 --> 00:27:50,752
horrible things.

525
00:27:50,755 --> 00:27:52,604
I'm not like that.

526
00:27:52,607 --> 00:27:54,941
I am not like you.

527
00:27:54,944 --> 00:27:56,299
Aren't you?

528
00:27:58,381 --> 00:27:59,747
No.

529
00:28:05,907 --> 00:28:07,506
Then why are you here?

530
00:28:16,966 --> 00:28:19,033
To say goodbye, Dad.

531
00:28:22,805 --> 00:28:25,004
And also to say...

532
00:28:25,007 --> 00:28:26,774
No more darkness,

533
00:28:28,678 --> 00:28:30,111
no more evil.

534
00:28:32,849 --> 00:28:34,248
It's over.

535
00:28:39,689 --> 00:28:41,889
You have no power over me.

536
00:28:50,166 --> 00:28:53,120
You'll be back, Betty.

537
00:28:53,123 --> 00:28:56,936
You can move across the country,
you can change the locks!

538
00:28:56,939 --> 00:28:59,151
You can fry me in the electric chair,

539
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:02,576
but I will always be with you, Betty...

540
00:29:10,453 --> 00:29:13,826
Attention, Riverdale High students.

541
00:29:13,829 --> 00:29:16,763
The results of your student
council election are in.

542
00:29:18,036 --> 00:29:20,638
Your new student body president is...

543
00:29:20,641 --> 00:29:21,907
Archie Andrews.

544
00:29:27,709 --> 00:29:29,536
In unrelated news,

545
00:29:29,539 --> 00:29:31,177
for the foreseeable future,

546
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:35,162
all former Southside High students
will remain at Riverdale High.

547
00:29:35,165 --> 00:29:36,145
That is all.

548
00:29:57,876 --> 00:29:59,866
Listen up now!

549
00:29:59,869 --> 00:30:01,268
Hey, listen up!

550
00:30:02,905 --> 00:30:05,373
Some 60 years ago,

551
00:30:05,376 --> 00:30:08,241
the very first Serpent
meeting took place

552
00:30:08,244 --> 00:30:11,404
on these same riverbanks.
And it makes sense

553
00:30:11,407 --> 00:30:13,966
that is where we gather now, where I...

554
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:20,732
Where I say my goodbye. Jughead,
would you step up here, son?

555
00:30:29,232 --> 00:30:30,346
Dad, what are you doing?

556
00:30:30,349 --> 00:30:32,633
What I should've done a long time ago.

557
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:37,318
I'm retiring from the Serpents.

558
00:30:37,321 --> 00:30:39,907
For real this time.

559
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:41,604
Whoa.

560
00:30:41,607 --> 00:30:43,560
But my boy...

561
00:30:43,563 --> 00:30:47,716
My boy has never stopped
fighting for this crew.

562
00:30:47,719 --> 00:30:50,183
Hell, he almost died for it.

563
00:30:50,186 --> 00:30:52,906
That's why I'm giving you the mantle.

564
00:31:02,386 --> 00:31:06,549
And now, as your first
official duty as Serpent King...

565
00:31:10,763 --> 00:31:13,018
I think you know what to do with this.

566
00:31:14,911 --> 00:31:16,252
Take it.

567
00:31:26,222 --> 00:31:28,541
All right. All right.

568
00:31:28,544 --> 00:31:30,268
All I can say is...

569
00:31:32,034 --> 00:31:33,267
I love you, Dad.

570
00:31:34,845 --> 00:31:36,845
And the Serpents will not die out.

571
00:31:36,848 --> 00:31:38,104
Not on my watch.

572
00:32:08,077 --> 00:32:10,311
I wanted to let you know, Mom...

573
00:32:12,369 --> 00:32:14,202
I went to see Dad today.

574
00:32:16,572 --> 00:32:17,605
How did it go?

575
00:32:17,607 --> 00:32:19,440
To be honest, it was...

576
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:22,315
hard.

577
00:32:24,313 --> 00:32:27,026
But I... I think, tomorrow,

578
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:30,635
I want to go back to school
if you think you'll be okay.

579
00:32:42,999 --> 00:32:44,365
Hello?

580
00:32:46,435 --> 00:32:48,705
Well, um...

581
00:32:48,708 --> 00:32:50,596
I appreciate it.

582
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:52,002
Thanks.

583
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,037
Hermione won.

584
00:33:04,918 --> 00:33:06,418
I'm sorry, Dad.

585
00:33:12,695 --> 00:33:13,827
Dad.

586
00:33:18,143 --> 00:33:19,901
Hello, Fred.

587
00:33:19,904 --> 00:33:21,432
May I come in?

588
00:33:21,435 --> 00:33:23,565
Was it close, at least?

589
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:25,034
Very.

590
00:33:25,037 --> 00:33:26,674
Less than 200 votes.

591
00:33:26,677 --> 00:33:28,031
So, what, you came to gloat?

592
00:33:28,034 --> 00:33:29,487
No, Sierra.

593
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:33,401
I came to tell Fred that
he ran a great campaign.

594
00:33:45,786 --> 00:33:47,986
Hey, where did you say
your dad was again, tonight?

595
00:33:50,479 --> 00:33:51,678
Veronica?

596
00:33:53,069 --> 00:33:54,535
Hermione?

597
00:33:56,872 --> 00:33:58,572
They're at my house, Mr. Lodge.

598
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,547
Archie, what are you...

599
00:34:08,217 --> 00:34:09,750
How did you get in here?

600
00:34:13,289 --> 00:34:15,338
The door to the servant's quarters

601
00:34:15,341 --> 00:34:17,244
that Veronica keeps unlocked for me.

602
00:34:19,061 --> 00:34:20,327
Oh.

603
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:23,354
Well, I'll have to see about
getting those locks changed.

604
00:34:24,934 --> 00:34:27,002
Oh, congratulations, Mr. Lodge.

605
00:34:27,005 --> 00:34:28,479
You won...

606
00:34:28,482 --> 00:34:30,338
everything you wanted.

607
00:34:30,341 --> 00:34:34,291
The Wyrm, the election, the Southside,

608
00:34:34,294 --> 00:34:35,493
the town.

609
00:34:38,347 --> 00:34:40,166
Oh, what do you have there, Archie?

610
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:51,565
After my dad was shot,
I felt lost, powerless.

611
00:34:51,568 --> 00:34:53,659
And you took advantage of that,

612
00:34:53,662 --> 00:34:55,561
manipulated me.

613
00:34:56,933 --> 00:34:59,099
I know about Tall Boy, Mr. Lodge.

614
00:34:59,102 --> 00:35:00,510
That you hired him

615
00:35:00,513 --> 00:35:02,682
to go after my dad,

616
00:35:02,685 --> 00:35:06,706
the same way you got
Andre to kill Papa Poutine,

617
00:35:06,709 --> 00:35:08,869
and that boy at Shadow Lake.

618
00:35:08,872 --> 00:35:11,112
What was his name, Cassidy something?

619
00:35:12,248 --> 00:35:14,315
I practically saw that murder.

620
00:35:15,251 --> 00:35:16,683
And Penny.

621
00:35:16,685 --> 00:35:19,737
And the Ghoulies who almost
killed Jughead at your bidding.

622
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,096
Archie...

623
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:24,940
These delusions of yours...

624
00:35:27,455 --> 00:35:29,329
You're smart, Mr. Lodge.

625
00:35:30,088 --> 00:35:33,333
So, all or any of this
will be hard to prove.

626
00:35:34,436 --> 00:35:36,235
But I will.

627
00:35:36,238 --> 00:35:38,004
Wherever you go,

628
00:35:38,007 --> 00:35:39,799
whatever you do,

629
00:35:39,802 --> 00:35:42,842
I'm gonna be there,

630
00:35:42,845 --> 00:35:44,588
watching.

631
00:35:44,591 --> 00:35:46,721
And when I do prove this,

632
00:35:46,724 --> 00:35:48,424
I'm just gonna come for you.

633
00:35:49,587 --> 00:35:52,388
And I won't hesitate like
I did with the Black Hood.

634
00:35:53,994 --> 00:35:57,971
I'm gonna make my
bones once and for all!

635
00:36:17,254 --> 00:36:20,744
Well, here's a fun fact
about my newest acquisition.

636
00:36:20,747 --> 00:36:22,623
According to Pop Tate,

637
00:36:22,626 --> 00:36:26,721
the basement of this very diner
used to be a secret speakeasy,

638
00:36:26,724 --> 00:36:30,401
back in the days of flapper
dresses and cigarette girls.

639
00:36:30,404 --> 00:36:31,733
So...

640
00:36:32,636 --> 00:36:33,668
Yes?

641
00:36:34,805 --> 00:36:36,729
I want to reopen that speakeasy.

642
00:36:36,732 --> 00:36:39,580
A cabaret space for
world-class entertainment

643
00:36:39,583 --> 00:36:41,635
and the most decadent cocktails.

644
00:36:41,638 --> 00:36:43,807
A place for North and Southsiders alike.

645
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:47,385
In fact, Jughead, I was hoping
your dad might want to manage it.

646
00:36:47,388 --> 00:36:50,229
To make sure the Serpents
feel welcome and at home.

647
00:36:50,232 --> 00:36:51,554
That's amazing, Vee.

648
00:36:55,385 --> 00:36:56,591
What about your dad?

649
00:36:58,061 --> 00:37:00,261
Knowing Daddy,

650
00:37:00,264 --> 00:37:03,098
he's probably plotting
some sort of revenge.

651
00:37:03,101 --> 00:37:06,808
And though, Veronica said
it as a half-joke, in fact...

652
00:37:07,686 --> 00:37:09,924
That's exactly what
her father was doing.

653
00:37:11,074 --> 00:37:12,734
Ladies, gentlemen,

654
00:37:12,737 --> 00:37:15,443
it's been months in the
making, but we're finally here.

655
00:37:16,446 --> 00:37:18,135
Welcome to New Southside.

656
00:37:18,138 --> 00:37:19,784
Where's your wife, Hiram?

657
00:37:19,787 --> 00:37:23,440
Now that she's Mayor, there are certain
machinations she can't be privy to.

658
00:37:23,443 --> 00:37:25,019
But the plan remains the same.

659
00:37:25,022 --> 00:37:27,255
The prison will soon
be up and operational,

660
00:37:27,258 --> 00:37:29,390
with your drugs running
through it, Claudius.

661
00:37:29,393 --> 00:37:31,448
Like brother, like brother.

662
00:37:31,451 --> 00:37:35,049
Malachai and his Ghoulies will
be our soldiers and dealers,

663
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:36,635
with Ms. Peabody troubleshooting.

664
00:37:36,638 --> 00:37:39,744
And hopefully, doing a better job
than she did of killing Jughead Jones.

665
00:37:39,747 --> 00:37:41,869
He wasn't breathing when we left him.

666
00:37:41,872 --> 00:37:44,672
You promised me a brothel, Hiram.

667
00:37:44,675 --> 00:37:47,104
All in good time, Madam Blossom.

668
00:37:47,107 --> 00:37:50,096
What about your daughter
and her meddlesome friends?

669
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:51,213
Not a concern.

670
00:37:52,992 --> 00:37:54,479
Steps have been taken

671
00:37:54,482 --> 00:37:58,635
to dissolve the very glue
that holds them together.

672
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,690
I'm proud of you, Mom...

673
00:38:05,693 --> 00:38:07,541
for going to visit Dad.

674
00:38:07,544 --> 00:38:09,471
I know that wasn't easy on you.

675
00:38:09,474 --> 00:38:11,833
We all have our albatrosses, Polly.

676
00:38:15,238 --> 00:38:19,574
I think I have someone
who can help you, Mom.

677
00:38:19,577 --> 00:38:22,676
A friend of mine from the farm,

678
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:24,846
who healed me when I was so...

679
00:38:24,849 --> 00:38:27,221
broken, after Jason.

680
00:38:27,224 --> 00:38:29,398
If you're open to it,

681
00:38:29,401 --> 00:38:32,787
I would love to invite him
to come visit and talk to you.

682
00:38:34,358 --> 00:38:36,191
That sounds nice, Polly.

683
00:38:41,031 --> 00:38:43,598
What made you decide
to book this room, Jug?

684
00:38:43,601 --> 00:38:45,933
Not that I'm complaining, mind you.

685
00:38:45,936 --> 00:38:47,402
I don't know.

686
00:38:48,455 --> 00:38:51,712
Felt like after everything that
happened that night at the Five Seasons,

687
00:38:51,715 --> 00:38:53,775
might be something you'd enjoy.

688
00:38:57,014 --> 00:38:59,463
I actually wanted to ask you something.

689
00:38:59,466 --> 00:39:02,783
Now that I am the Serpent King...

690
00:39:04,322 --> 00:39:07,349
I was wondering how you
felt about being my queen.

691
00:39:09,893 --> 00:39:12,394
Are you asking me to
join the Serpents, Jug?

692
00:39:14,002 --> 00:39:15,296
Sort of.

693
00:39:15,299 --> 00:39:16,464
Jug.

694
00:39:18,068 --> 00:39:20,846
You don't have to answer right now.

695
00:39:20,849 --> 00:39:23,010
You can take your time. Let me know.

696
00:39:24,701 --> 00:39:27,284
Like, tomorrow at lunch, or...

697
00:39:30,213 --> 00:39:31,780
It was a foolish question

698
00:39:31,782 --> 00:39:34,359
asked between two young people in love.

699
00:39:34,362 --> 00:39:37,052
But it didn't matter, for
it would soon be overshadowed

700
00:39:37,054 --> 00:39:39,726
by the next day's cataclysmic events.

701
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:48,666
Students,

702
00:39:48,669 --> 00:39:49,885
faculty and staff,

703
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:54,080
before we inaugurate Archie Andrews
as our new student council president,

704
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:56,026
please rise for our national anthem.
