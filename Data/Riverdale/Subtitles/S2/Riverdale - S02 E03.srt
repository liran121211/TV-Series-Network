1
00:00:00,032 --> 00:00:01,899
Previously on Riverdale...

2
00:00:01,902 --> 00:00:06,029
I'm so glad that you're home
safe and that the babies are okay.

3
00:00:06,031 --> 00:00:09,449
- He's transferring to Southside High.
- I'm not a Serpent, okay.

4
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:11,804
It might be my dad's life, but not mine.

5
00:00:11,807 --> 00:00:14,329
You get shot. Ms. Grundy's murdered.

6
00:00:14,331 --> 00:00:17,382
What if some crazy person is going
after the people that I care about?

7
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:23,674
Every fairy tale comes
with the same warning:

8
00:00:24,508 --> 00:00:28,345
Good children should never
go into the woods alone.

9
00:00:29,937 --> 00:00:33,107
Stray from the path and who
knows what you'll encounter.

10
00:00:35,081 --> 00:00:36,436
A hungry wolf.

11
00:00:37,815 --> 00:00:39,106
A handsome devil.

12
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:46,069
Or maybe something worse.

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,955
Help! Help! Help me, please!

14
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,541
Help! Help!

15
00:00:59,501 --> 00:01:03,213
Oh, I can take that in to Daddy.
I wanna ask him something, anyway.

16
00:01:03,216 --> 00:01:05,462
Your father and I have
business to discuss.

17
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:08,299
- You know the rules about his study.
- Mom, those were the old rules.

18
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:10,677
Which still apply, Veronica.

19
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,514
I thought I heard my two
palomitas out here chirping.

20
00:01:14,516 --> 00:01:16,266
Is that my café con leche?

21
00:01:16,268 --> 00:01:17,475
Thank you, corazón.

22
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:20,151
Tonight's the season
premiere of The Matchlerette.

23
00:01:20,154 --> 00:01:22,171
I would love to have my
friends over to watch.

24
00:01:22,174 --> 00:01:24,401
- Who exactly are these friends?
- Inner circle only.

25
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,067
Hmm.

26
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:28,903
You can watch with us.
They're dying to meet you.

27
00:01:28,905 --> 00:01:31,781
- Of course they're welcome to come over, mija.
- Thank you, Daddy.

28
00:01:31,784 --> 00:01:33,286
- Mm-hm.
- Mwah.

29
00:01:39,249 --> 00:01:41,753
Hey captain, are we gonna start this
practise or what? Where's Coach Clayton?

30
00:01:41,756 --> 00:01:44,798
- He's at the hospital with Moose and Midge.
- What?

31
00:01:44,801 --> 00:01:47,831
- Hey, guys!
- I only know what coach told me.

32
00:01:48,826 --> 00:01:53,037
Late last night, Moose got shot like multiple
times by some lunatic at Lovers' Lane.

33
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,139
- Oh, my God...
- No, Arch, he's alive. So's Midge.

34
00:01:56,141 --> 00:01:59,776
He, like, shielded her with
his body. She didn't get hit.

35
00:01:59,779 --> 00:02:01,188
Practice is canceled.

36
00:02:05,442 --> 00:02:08,151
You don't think they're
targeting students, do you?

37
00:02:08,153 --> 00:02:10,904
Should we be worried?
Like, what's going on?

38
00:02:10,906 --> 00:02:13,406
It was full-on Carrie.

39
00:02:13,408 --> 00:02:17,035
Midge covered in Moose's
blood, screaming like a banshee.

40
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:18,167
It was insane.

41
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,485
Kev, what were you even doing
there? You could've been shot, too

42
00:02:20,487 --> 00:02:23,207
I was just night-jogging,
you know, as one does,

43
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,542
and suddenly, I hear gunshots.

44
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:28,088
Can we agree at least agree now
that there's a killer on the loose?

45
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:31,088
- With terrible aim.
- Jughead, he murdered Ms. Grundy.

46
00:02:31,091 --> 00:02:33,926
Arch, we don't know that these
three crimes are related.

47
00:02:33,929 --> 00:02:36,554
Guys, can we focus on what matters here?

48
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:39,849
Midge and Moose are alive.
Archie's dad survived.

49
00:02:39,851 --> 00:02:43,269
The new season of <i>The Matchlerette</i> starts
tonight. You're all coming over to watch.

50
00:02:43,271 --> 00:02:45,814
There's a shooter terrorizing the town.

51
00:02:45,816 --> 00:02:48,525
You really want us to watch a
gross reality dating show?

52
00:02:48,527 --> 00:02:52,172
What I really want is for you
guys to meet my dad officially.

53
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,868
Back in New York, my dad
was always in his study,

54
00:02:54,871 --> 00:02:57,742
doing very bad things,
as it turns out.

55
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:00,172
I'm tired of closed doors.

56
00:03:00,175 --> 00:03:02,997
I need to know my dad's life
and he needs to know mine.

57
00:03:02,999 --> 00:03:05,792
- Well, we'll be there, V. Can't wait.
- Thank you.

58
00:03:05,794 --> 00:03:09,671
Hey, Andrews, we're going to the
hospital to see Moose. You coming?

59
00:03:09,673 --> 00:03:12,258
Yeah, for sure. I'll
see you tonight, Ronnie.

60
00:03:12,261 --> 00:03:15,135
I better go. Was supposed
to meet my peer mentor

61
00:03:15,137 --> 00:03:18,429
- at Southside High half an hour ago.
- Wait, are...?

62
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:22,657
Are you sure you can't
just keep going here?

63
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,854
I'll be fine.

64
00:03:26,047 --> 00:03:27,274
Bye.

65
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:36,531
Okay, it's just us now. Night-jogging?

66
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:39,784
Yeah. I'm trying to get
in shape for wrestling.

67
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:42,927
Okay, fine, I was cruising Fox Forest.

68
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,993
But I am going out for wrestling. And
I had to tell my dad I was jogging.

69
00:03:45,996 --> 00:03:48,485
- And he believed you?
- Yeah. Cause he wants to believe me.

70
00:03:48,488 --> 00:03:52,180
Hey, look, I get it, you're
post-Joaquin, but cruising?

71
00:03:52,183 --> 00:03:55,485
Come on, Kev, you know I hate that.

72
00:03:55,488 --> 00:03:58,573
Why can't you use Grind'em like
every other gay guy in the world?

73
00:03:58,576 --> 00:04:00,615
Nobody's who they say they are online.

74
00:04:00,618 --> 00:04:02,783
At least in real life, what
you see is what you get,

75
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:03,933
there's no surprises.

76
00:04:03,935 --> 00:04:07,782
Moose and Midge were shot
literally 300 yards from Fox Forest,

77
00:04:07,785 --> 00:04:10,321
and the person who did
it is still out there.

78
00:04:10,324 --> 00:04:12,991
Tell me you won't go back there
at least not until he's caught.

79
00:04:12,994 --> 00:04:16,448
Okay, fine. I will not
go back. Scout's honor.

80
00:04:22,412 --> 00:04:25,790
If I wasn't such a big slab of
beef, Midge might've been hit too.

81
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,876
You saved her life, bro.

82
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,666
Your nurse is hot. Cause like what if you
pop a boner during like a sponge bath?

83
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:38,042
And it wasn't a ski mask? He was
wearing a black hood for sure?

84
00:04:39,325 --> 00:04:42,036
Anything else you remember
about how he looked?

85
00:04:43,297 --> 00:04:44,574
His eyes.

86
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,231
They're green, right?

87
00:04:50,032 --> 00:04:51,316
They were blank.

88
00:04:52,609 --> 00:04:54,861
It was like there wasn't
even a person behind them.

89
00:04:57,022 --> 00:05:00,234
He was like Michael Myers.
He had the devil's eyes.

90
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,753
- It's the pins on my hat.
- Take it off, go again.

91
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,907
Forsythe Pendleton Jones III.

92
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,977
Uh... it's Jughead, actually.

93
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,107
I'm Toni Topaz.

94
00:05:26,948 --> 00:05:30,388
I was supposed to give you the full
animatronic tour of Southside High,

95
00:05:30,391 --> 00:05:33,856
but some of the robots went insane
and started killing the guests,

96
00:05:33,858 --> 00:05:35,969
so, we'll just wing it.

97
00:05:37,552 --> 00:05:41,012
The classrooms don't have Wi-Fi,
the bathroom stalls don't have doors.

98
00:05:41,015 --> 00:05:42,932
What about the school
paper <i>The Red and Black?</i>

99
00:05:42,935 --> 00:05:47,062
Yeah, it no longer exists. Censorship?
Budget cuts? Take your pick.

100
00:05:47,065 --> 00:05:52,652
To your right, you'll find a rare glimpse of
jingle-jangle being consumed in its natural habitat.

101
00:05:52,655 --> 00:05:54,835
I'm sorry, "jingle-jangle"?

102
00:05:54,838 --> 00:05:59,549
This place is crawling with the JJ.
A highly addictive total gutter drug.

103
00:05:59,551 --> 00:06:01,641
So, let's not touch that.

104
00:06:02,485 --> 00:06:03,722
Jingle-jangle.

105
00:06:04,485 --> 00:06:06,071
Fascinating.

106
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:09,434
All right. Here in the cafetorium,
The Ghoulies sit over there.

107
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:13,896
Rival gang, drug dealers, street
racers, rumors of cannibalism.

108
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:15,681
Don't ask.

109
00:06:15,684 --> 00:06:18,602
And we sit over there.
With the Serpents.

110
00:06:18,605 --> 00:06:20,493
You're a Southside Serpent?

111
00:06:20,496 --> 00:06:23,624
Why do you think that I volunteered
to give you the tour? Come on.

112
00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:27,201
Actually, I'm gonna sit alone.

113
00:06:27,203 --> 00:06:30,332
Just, you know, finish
my book and brood.

114
00:06:30,967 --> 00:06:34,093
I'm confused. Aren't you
like a Serpent by blood?

115
00:06:34,096 --> 00:06:36,305
The son of FP Jones?

116
00:06:36,308 --> 00:06:37,682
Yeah.

117
00:06:37,685 --> 00:06:42,438
So, I self-identify as a
loner, not a pack animal.

118
00:06:42,441 --> 00:06:46,318
I'm just gonna put my head down
and try and get through this, okay?

119
00:06:46,321 --> 00:06:51,086
Hey, you wanna get through this,
you should hang with the Serpents.

120
00:06:52,103 --> 00:06:55,104
If the Ghoulies get a whiff
that you're alone, or vulnerable,

121
00:06:55,106 --> 00:06:59,360
they'll make you their bitch faster
than you can say American History X.

122
00:07:03,073 --> 00:07:06,864
Moose and Midge described him, dad. The same guy
that shot you, the same hood, the same eyes.

123
00:07:06,867 --> 00:07:08,935
Well, maybe and maybe not.

124
00:07:08,938 --> 00:07:10,548
Dad, it's him.

125
00:07:10,551 --> 00:07:15,239
And if Sheriff Keller's not gonna take that seriously,
then I think we should... we should be ready.

126
00:07:15,242 --> 00:07:19,703
Like, maybe we should buy a
gun, just be armed in case...

127
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:20,879
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

128
00:07:20,882 --> 00:07:24,678
Easy, okay? Ease up on that. We're
gonna let the cops do their job.

129
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:28,428
"Armed"? What the hell
are you talking about?

130
00:07:28,431 --> 00:07:29,935
Archie, this is not the Wild West.

131
00:07:29,938 --> 00:07:33,544
We don't keep guns in this house. Okay?

132
00:07:33,547 --> 00:07:34,813
So, just cool it.

133
00:07:38,103 --> 00:07:40,563
Why don't you come sit
down next to me, loverboy?

134
00:07:42,112 --> 00:07:45,988
- Archie?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. This thing with Moose...

135
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:49,701
Honesty, it's like nobody cares. My dad
keeps saying, "Leave it to Sheriff Keller."

136
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:53,372
And I'm like, "Yeah, dad, cos he did such a
great job of catching Jason's murderer."

137
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,413
Oh. Wait, I'm sorry, that was us.

138
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:56,832
Inside voices, please?

139
00:07:56,835 --> 00:07:58,251
No, don't stop him.

140
00:07:58,253 --> 00:08:01,145
Archie going Travis Bickle
is my favorite Archie yet.

141
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:04,860
Doesn't it feel like he's
targeting us? I mean, specifically?

142
00:08:06,177 --> 00:08:08,388
I don't want anyone else getting hurt.

143
00:08:08,391 --> 00:08:11,349
You know back in the salad days,
when we had a getaway on the Cape,

144
00:08:11,352 --> 00:08:15,521
all of us got together and hired
private security to keep out the riffraff

145
00:08:15,524 --> 00:08:18,895
- as an added layer of protection.
- I loved that little house.

146
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:21,607
- Daddy.
- We're on our way to dinner at the club.

147
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,474
Yeah. But I wanted to
meet your friends first.

148
00:08:24,112 --> 00:08:25,321
Great. Thank you.

149
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,251
- Ah. This is Betty Cooper.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

150
00:08:29,254 --> 00:08:30,906
And Jughead Jones.

151
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:31,825
- Hi.
- Hey.

152
00:08:31,828 --> 00:08:34,162
- You know my dad.
- I do. He's a good man.

153
00:08:34,164 --> 00:08:35,204
He values family.

154
00:08:35,206 --> 00:08:38,040
I hope his return comes
sooner rather than later.

155
00:08:38,042 --> 00:08:40,376
- Yeah, so do we.
- And, Daddy, this is...

156
00:08:40,378 --> 00:08:43,590
Archie Andrews. The boy who's
captured my daughter's heart.

157
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:47,122
- Daddy.
- Uh, it's nice to meet you, sir.

158
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,334
Ah, please.

159
00:08:49,651 --> 00:08:50,694
Call me Hiram.

160
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:56,729
Listen, I couldn't help but overhear
your discussion and I, um...

161
00:08:56,732 --> 00:08:59,227
I understand your frustration
with Sheriff Keller.

162
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:03,191
As for someone who's had his own
share of run-ins with the law...

163
00:09:04,527 --> 00:09:07,614
I can say with confidence that the
police aren't always the solution.

164
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:12,617
Sometimes we need to take
matters into our own hands.

165
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:15,692
- We need to be able to protect ourselves.
- We're gonna lose our table.

166
00:09:15,695 --> 00:09:17,064
Oh, yes, of course.

167
00:09:17,067 --> 00:09:19,435
Hey, it was nice to meet all of you.

168
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,545
- Oh, and Archie.
- Yes.

169
00:09:24,547 --> 00:09:27,067
Why don't you come over
for dinner this week?

170
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:30,740
I look forward to seeing what you
come up with... to save Riverdale.

171

172
00:10:28,313 --> 00:10:30,774
About Archie coming over for dinner...

173
00:10:31,657 --> 00:10:33,782
I wouldn't push that if I were you.

174
00:10:33,785 --> 00:10:36,986
I'm not. Daddy invited Archie.

175
00:10:36,988 --> 00:10:39,221
- Mm-hm.
- Daddy wants to please his little girl.

176
00:10:39,224 --> 00:10:41,310
And you want your father's approval.

177
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:43,244
Mija...

178
00:10:44,371 --> 00:10:46,665
you want everything to change overnight.

179
00:10:47,499 --> 00:10:49,924
You want him to be
friends with your friends.

180
00:10:49,927 --> 00:10:53,012
And that will happen.
Just no need to rush it.

181
00:10:53,015 --> 00:10:55,017
No need to be so thirsty, Veronica.

182
00:11:06,434 --> 00:11:08,101
I'm off to school. Here.

183
00:11:08,103 --> 00:11:10,855
- What's that?
- I don't know. It was on the porch.

184
00:11:13,942 --> 00:11:15,902
Guys, we're under attack.

185
00:11:17,328 --> 00:11:20,206
And by "we," I mean our
friends, our families.

186
00:11:21,491 --> 00:11:23,368
This time, it was Moose and Midge.

187
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:28,297
Next time, it could be you...
your girlfriend, your family.

188
00:11:29,124 --> 00:11:31,126
It's time to do something about it.

189
00:11:32,085 --> 00:11:34,168
I want us to start a watch group.

190
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:37,015
Not to canvass the town,
that's not workable,

191
00:11:37,018 --> 00:11:40,008
but to focus on Riverdale
High, its students,

192
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:42,302
its faculty and staff, its parents,

193
00:11:42,304 --> 00:11:45,788
where we all hang out, an extra
circle of protection around it.

194
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:49,809
You want us to take it to
the streets, kick some ass.

195
00:11:49,811 --> 00:11:55,648
That was my first thought, too,
Reg. But no, no weapons, no violence.

196
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:59,736
I'm talking about a patrol, an extra
set of eyes and ears for the police.

197
00:11:59,738 --> 00:12:01,781
And what if we run into the killer?

198
00:12:05,368 --> 00:12:06,995
Then we call Sheriff Keller.

199
00:12:07,662 --> 00:12:10,054
We're not vigilantes. We're watchdogs.

200
00:12:10,057 --> 00:12:13,968
- We're the Watchdogs.
- We're not called the Watchdogs, Reg.

201
00:12:15,295 --> 00:12:16,838
We're called the Red Circle.

202
00:12:17,788 --> 00:12:19,007
We hold the line.

203
00:12:19,633 --> 00:12:23,259
We're not waiting around for the next attack.
From now on, we're protecting our own.

204
00:12:23,261 --> 00:12:26,163
- Whoo! Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah.

205
00:12:30,143 --> 00:12:32,268
Fahrenheit 451,

206
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:35,104
by one of my favorite
authors, Ray Bradbury.

207
00:12:35,106 --> 00:12:36,650
Let's start with the title.

208
00:12:37,434 --> 00:12:39,476
Can anyone tell me its significance?

209
00:12:39,479 --> 00:12:41,029
What? Damn it!

210
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,621
People, there's a
burning book on the cover.

211
00:12:54,084 --> 00:12:57,545
Fahrenheit 451 is the
temperature at which paper burns.

212
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,342
"It was a pleasure to burn."

213
00:13:03,593 --> 00:13:04,842
Indeed.

214
00:13:04,844 --> 00:13:09,891
Thank you, Mr... Jones.
And welcome to hell.

215
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,692
Uh, hi, Mr. Phillips?

216
00:13:20,694 --> 00:13:22,610
Mr. Jones.

217
00:13:22,612 --> 00:13:25,710
Toni was telling me you used
to advise the school paper.

218
00:13:25,713 --> 00:13:27,548
I was wondering what happened.

219
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:32,226
Drugs and gangs came to Southside High.

220
00:13:33,163 --> 00:13:36,265
Trying to get students interested
in anything like the school paper

221
00:13:36,268 --> 00:13:38,584
was an exercise in futility.

222
00:13:38,586 --> 00:13:40,186
I'm interested. I
have experience too.

223
00:13:40,189 --> 00:13:43,300
When I was at Riverdale High, I
wrote for the <i>Blue and Gold.</i>

224
00:13:43,303 --> 00:13:45,510
I'll put in the work.

225
00:13:47,511 --> 00:13:49,301
Your articles online?

226
00:13:49,304 --> 00:13:50,596
Mm-hm.

227
00:13:50,598 --> 00:13:52,660
I'll take a look, let you know.

228
00:13:52,663 --> 00:13:53,935
Thanks.

229
00:13:57,981 --> 00:14:00,732
Hey. What happened last night?

230
00:14:00,734 --> 00:14:02,567
You said you were coming to Veronica's.

231
00:14:02,569 --> 00:14:03,945
Yeah, something came up.

232
00:14:06,072 --> 00:14:07,780
Something in the woods?

233
00:14:07,782 --> 00:14:09,907
Betty, don't take this the wrong way,

234
00:14:09,909 --> 00:14:14,470
but how many years did I listen to you go
on and on about Archie and now Jughead?

235
00:14:14,473 --> 00:14:16,807
Did you ask my permission to date them?

236
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:19,477
No. You didn't need it.
And I don't need yours.

237
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,463
- Dating is one thing. This is...
- It's none of your business.

238
00:14:23,465 --> 00:14:25,298
I'll, uh, catch you later.

239
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,468
Kev.

240
00:14:29,929 --> 00:14:34,642
So, button-down Kevin Keller
has a sex-drive. So what?

241
00:14:35,685 --> 00:14:40,212
So, it's putting him in
danger. Why won't he just stop?

242
00:14:40,215 --> 00:14:43,610
Oh, Betty. How little you
know of the human psyche.

243
00:14:44,611 --> 00:14:48,239
Kevin used to be a lonely,
awkward fat boy with acne.

244
00:14:49,064 --> 00:14:50,575
Now he's a smoke-show.

245
00:14:51,367 --> 00:14:52,492
And?

246
00:14:52,494 --> 00:14:56,037
In his mind, he's still
that unattractive Pugsley.

247
00:14:56,039 --> 00:15:01,086
Kevin wants validation, connection,
even if he has to find it in the woods.

248
00:15:01,753 --> 00:15:05,256
Even with a killer on the
loose. Even if you don't approve.

249
00:15:10,553 --> 00:15:12,970
I have incredible news, Archiekins.

250
00:15:12,972 --> 00:15:16,267
You are invited to dinner
with my parents, chez moi.

251
00:15:17,268 --> 00:15:20,019
- Oh, Ronnie, this week's crazy...
- I don't care.

252
00:15:20,021 --> 00:15:22,271
Archie, this is nonnegotiable.

253
00:15:22,273 --> 00:15:25,441
That drive-by he did during the <i>The
Matchlerette</i> was a kind gesture,

254
00:15:25,443 --> 00:15:30,321
but this, this is like... I don't wanna
call it a test, though it kind of is.

255
00:15:30,323 --> 00:15:33,616
- What am I being tested for?
- Not you, my father.

256
00:15:33,618 --> 00:15:35,952
Can he just be a dad for one night?

257
00:15:35,954 --> 00:15:40,583
No agenda other than getting to
know someone who's important to me.

258
00:15:42,043 --> 00:15:46,546
- Well, In that case, I'll be there for you, Ronnie.
- Sadly, I don't have time to teach you Spanish,

259
00:15:46,548 --> 00:15:49,841
but I've selected some common phrases
for you to memorize and practice.

260
00:15:49,843 --> 00:15:53,843
Oh. And can we not talk about that
private army you're starting? Okay?

261
00:15:53,846 --> 00:15:55,265
Thanks.

262
00:16:03,143 --> 00:16:04,482
Hey.

263
00:16:05,567 --> 00:16:07,569
- Hey.
- What's wrong?

264
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:12,053
Your mother got some fan mail.

265
00:16:12,056 --> 00:16:16,411
He calls himself the Black Hood and
he wants us to publish this letter.

266
00:16:16,414 --> 00:16:18,502
He wants everyone to know

267
00:16:18,505 --> 00:16:21,830
that he shot Fred Andrews
and Moose and Midge...

268
00:16:22,506 --> 00:16:24,381
and murdered Geraldine Grundy.

269
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:26,801
Are you sure that this is real?

270
00:16:26,804 --> 00:16:28,389
Oh, it's real, all right.

271
00:16:39,952 --> 00:16:41,868
"This is the Black Hood.

272
00:16:41,893 --> 00:16:45,408
I am the man who shot
the adulterer at Pop's.

273
00:16:47,026 --> 00:16:49,904
I killed the child
predator in Greendale.

274
00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:54,990
I shot the drug-and sex-addicted
teenagers at Lovers' Lane.

275
00:16:54,992 --> 00:16:56,700
Riverdale is not innocent.

276
00:16:56,702 --> 00:17:00,706
It's a town of hypocrites,
degenerates, criminals.

277
00:17:02,124 --> 00:17:08,589
My wrath is the price of your
lies, your secrets, your sins.

278
00:17:09,298 --> 00:17:13,093
I will not stop. I cannot be stopped.

279
00:17:13,886 --> 00:17:16,972
I am the wolf. You are the flock.

280
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:21,227
This is the blood-letting.
You will hear from me again."

281
00:17:21,894 --> 00:17:24,269
Well, Tom, how real is this threat?

282
00:17:24,271 --> 00:17:26,815
Well, it's definitely
Fred Andrews' wallet.

283
00:17:27,691 --> 00:17:30,361
These sunglasses, I'm
checking with Greendale P.D.

284
00:17:32,196 --> 00:17:37,366
Alice, in the spirit of public
safety... Tom, tell me if you disagree.

285
00:17:37,368 --> 00:17:40,410
I think it's important to not
give this lunatic an audience.

286
00:17:40,412 --> 00:17:44,315
Mayor McCoy, it is our responsibility to
let the public know that he's out there

287
00:17:44,318 --> 00:17:46,659
targeting his next victim.

288
00:17:46,662 --> 00:17:50,254
If you.. If you print this,
you're gonna cause panic.

289
00:17:50,256 --> 00:17:54,383
I want a media blackout for 24
hours on this letter, at least.

290
00:17:54,385 --> 00:17:56,635
And I'll be taking it into Evidence.

291
00:17:56,637 --> 00:17:58,178
I'll send you a copy.

292
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,721
Oh, no need, sheriff.

293
00:17:59,723 --> 00:18:02,015
We made one right before
we sent it to the printer

294
00:18:02,017 --> 00:18:03,686
for tomorrow's front page.

295
00:18:05,187 --> 00:18:09,398
Mr. Jones, I read your
work. I'm impressed.

296
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,565
So much so that I'll consider
reopening the Red and the Black

297
00:18:12,568 --> 00:18:13,651
on two conditions:

298
00:18:13,654 --> 00:18:16,530
One, no gangs. Two, no jingle-jangle.

299
00:18:16,533 --> 00:18:19,867
You can write about them. If I see you
trafficking in either, we're done.

300
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,831
That will not be a problem for me.

301
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:28,669
You actually think I'd let a
bunch teenagers form a militia?

302
00:18:29,378 --> 00:18:31,420
We're trying to help, sheriff.

303
00:18:31,422 --> 00:18:34,172
- People are scared.
- Well, a lynch mob won't help that.

304
00:18:34,174 --> 00:18:37,217
- Sheriff Keller.
- Now we have a big problem here, Waldo.

305
00:18:37,219 --> 00:18:40,514
You see, your student has
formed his own private army.

306
00:18:41,682 --> 00:18:43,517
The Red Circle is a school club.

307
00:18:44,143 --> 00:18:45,726
You endorse this?

308
00:18:45,728 --> 00:18:48,103
Archie Andrews has shown 
tremendous initiative.

309
00:18:48,105 --> 00:18:51,442
You can't fault students for
wanting to protect each other.

310
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,070
Morning, Waldo.

311
00:19:07,499 --> 00:19:09,167
Well, it's no New York Times.

312
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:13,286
But, hey, kudos on finding
your safe space, snowflake.

313
00:19:13,297 --> 00:19:17,674
Yeah, all I need now is a
photographer with an amazing eye

314
00:19:17,676 --> 00:19:20,093
and a hunger for social justice,

315
00:19:20,095 --> 00:19:21,513
and I think I'll be set.

316
00:19:25,317 --> 00:19:27,319
Topaz. Let's bounce.

317
00:19:29,355 --> 00:19:32,272
Jones, wanna come with?
We're going to the quarry.

318
00:19:32,274 --> 00:19:35,108
Uh, I don't have my beach bod yet.

319
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:39,479
What? You'll ask for help from the Serpents
when you need it, but you won't hang with us?

320
00:19:39,482 --> 00:19:41,732
Don't come crawling to us, hat in hand,

321
00:19:41,735 --> 00:19:45,862
when some Ghoulie decides to earn his
stripes by taking out FP Jones' kid.

322
00:19:45,865 --> 00:19:48,409
Duly noted. Thank you, Sweet Pea.

323
00:19:49,778 --> 00:19:53,908
I appreciate what you and the Serpents
have done for me and my dad. I do.

324
00:19:55,242 --> 00:19:57,494
But I'm done. Okay?

325
00:19:58,738 --> 00:20:00,740
No more favors coming your way.

326
00:20:02,179 --> 00:20:04,515
Hey, hey, he made up his mind, okay?

327
00:20:05,182 --> 00:20:08,602
Take the hint, Sweet Pea.
He's just not that into you.

328
00:20:09,221 --> 00:20:10,562
Let's motor.

329
00:20:13,023 --> 00:20:14,400
Catch you later, Jones.

330
00:20:19,154 --> 00:20:23,198
- I'm going. I'm leaving Riverdale.
- Polly, slow down. You're going to give the babies whiplash.

331
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,495
I've already called the farm.
They still have room for me.

332
00:20:25,498 --> 00:20:26,488
Farm? What farm?

333
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:29,651
[POLLY] I've already called the farm.
They still have room for me.

334
00:20:29,654 --> 00:20:33,495
Hey honey, let's just talk about
this. Why are you leaving?

335
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:36,166
Ask Mom. She's the one baiting a killer.

336
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:39,596
- A killer targeting sinners.
- Polly, you're not a sinner.

337
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:42,308
I'm an unwed mother
carrying my cousin's babies.

338
00:20:42,311 --> 00:20:44,269
I am the poster child for sin.

339
00:20:44,272 --> 00:20:48,305
That's it. Over my dead body are
you gonna run off to some farm

340
00:20:48,308 --> 00:20:50,642
and give birth in a trough, no doubt.

341
00:20:50,644 --> 00:20:52,448
It might be over your dead body, Mother,

342
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:55,037
but it certainly won't be
over mine or my babies'.

343
00:20:56,574 --> 00:20:57,698
Polly!

344
00:20:57,701 --> 00:20:58,785
I'll talk to her.

345
00:21:07,318 --> 00:21:11,487
Midge wanted to thank
you... for saving my life.

346
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,501
You're like her new hero now.

347
00:21:17,713 --> 00:21:21,800
Hey, so, what were you doing
out there in the woods, anyways?

348
00:21:23,302 --> 00:21:27,096
What were you doing out there with
Midge? I mean besides drugs.

349
00:21:27,099 --> 00:21:31,226
That was her idea. She likes
to get a little crazy sometimes.

350
00:21:34,438 --> 00:21:37,024
I like Midge, a lot.

351
00:21:37,824 --> 00:21:40,869
Sometimes I'm not sure
we're that great a match.

352
00:21:42,571 --> 00:21:45,324
Kevin, are you okay?

353
00:21:46,241 --> 00:21:48,815
It just I haven't been making
great decisions lately.

354
00:21:48,818 --> 00:21:52,578
I've been lying to my dad, sneaking
around and going into the woods.

355
00:21:52,581 --> 00:21:55,290
I know it's dangerous, but
I also can't stop myself.

356
00:21:55,292 --> 00:21:57,794
It's like I don't even
care. What is that?

357
00:21:58,595 --> 00:22:01,556
I don't know, but guys like us?

358
00:22:02,508 --> 00:22:03,753
Like you?

359
00:22:04,551 --> 00:22:06,220
In a town like Riverdale?

360
00:22:07,562 --> 00:22:09,564
We don't have a lot of options.

361
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,935
So, even if something bad
could happen, we go for it,

362
00:22:15,938 --> 00:22:19,066
'cause what if for ten minutes...

363
00:22:19,983 --> 00:22:23,946
or maybe even just for two
minutes... we're not alone?

364
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,283
I'm glad you're okay, Moose. Midge, too.

365
00:22:30,675 --> 00:22:31,870
Kevin.

366
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,412
You don't have to go.

367
00:22:34,414 --> 00:22:36,917
Or you can come back, whenever.

368
00:22:37,709 --> 00:22:40,629
If you wanna hang out... or talk.

369
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,763
You're playing with
fire, I want you to know.

370
00:22:51,765 --> 00:22:54,099
I'm polishing cutlery, Mom.

371
00:22:54,101 --> 00:22:57,855
In advance of my parents getting to know
my boyfriend over a civilized dinner.

372
00:22:57,858 --> 00:23:01,597
That may be your agenda, but it's
not necessarily your father's.

373
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,401
He's making an effort,
I'm making an effort.

374
00:23:04,403 --> 00:23:06,371
The only person not
making an effort is you.

375
00:23:06,374 --> 00:23:09,531
- I'm trying to warn you, Vernoica
- About what, Mom?

376
00:23:09,533 --> 00:23:11,700
What do you think Daddy's
gonna do to Archie?

377
00:23:11,702 --> 00:23:14,535
Please, God, enough of
these veiled threats.

378
00:23:14,538 --> 00:23:16,705
Tell me you think he's dangerous.

379
00:23:16,707 --> 00:23:19,291
Say it to my face right now
or forever hold your peace

380
00:23:19,293 --> 00:23:22,087
because we're never having
this conversation again.

381
00:23:26,925 --> 00:23:28,427
Can't do it, can you?

382
00:23:32,339 --> 00:23:36,300
Just remember, you're the
one who welcomed him back.

383
00:23:50,933 --> 00:23:54,478
- Huh. I thought no weapons.
- I've had this bat since I was 10.

384
00:23:56,223 --> 00:23:57,599
Check out the backseat.

385
00:23:59,003 --> 00:24:00,234
Old-school.

386
00:24:09,744 --> 00:24:10,826
Oh...

387
00:24:10,828 --> 00:24:13,162
- Betty.
- So, this is the Red and Black.

388
00:24:13,164 --> 00:24:16,209
You cannot be here at
night unless you are armed.

389
00:24:17,251 --> 00:24:19,379
Well, I am.

390
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:25,266
Okay, honestly, Bets?
I hit pay dirt.

391
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:27,093
Do you remember how no one could explain

392
00:24:27,095 --> 00:24:29,970
the local component of Clifford
Blossom's drug pipeline?

393
00:24:29,972 --> 00:24:34,767
That jingle-jangle, the stuff Moose and
Midge were on? It's coming from here.

394
00:24:34,769 --> 00:24:39,563
My dad said that Serpents never deal
in hard drugs, but the Ghoulies do.

395
00:24:39,565 --> 00:24:41,857
Well, is it wise to be writing

396
00:24:41,859 --> 00:24:45,699
about gangs and drugs while
you're going to school here?

397
00:24:45,702 --> 00:24:47,156
Are you worried about me?

398
00:24:48,783 --> 00:24:50,576
Well, yeah, Jug.

399
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,872
I thought you liked me reckless.

400
00:25:03,923 --> 00:25:07,341
Oh, sorry, guys. I didn't
see the sock on the door.

401
00:25:07,343 --> 00:25:08,970
It's okay. Heh.

402
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,471
Hey, Toni. Ah...

403
00:25:12,473 --> 00:25:15,474
Betty, this is Toni. She is the
photographer for the newspaper.

404
00:25:15,476 --> 00:25:16,675
Oh.

405
00:25:16,678 --> 00:25:20,187
- This is Betty. This is my girlfriend.
- Hi, Toni.

406
00:25:20,189 --> 00:25:24,972
- Huh. You are not at all what I pictured.
- Really? What did you picture?

407
00:25:24,975 --> 00:25:26,944
Uh, Emily the Strange.

408
00:25:26,946 --> 00:25:28,739
Winona Ryder from Beetlejuice.

409
00:25:31,951 --> 00:25:33,619
Hey, look what Betty got us.

410
00:25:36,239 --> 00:25:37,532
Great minds.

411
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:40,293
Great minds.

412
00:25:43,753 --> 00:25:46,796
Well. Perfect timing. Zip me up?

413
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,011
Of course.

414
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:53,806
You know, the one thing about this
apartment is that sound carries.

415
00:25:55,315 --> 00:25:59,319
Even in my study with the door closed, I could
hear you and Veronica in the dining room...

416
00:26:00,813 --> 00:26:02,315
as if we're all together.

417
00:26:05,234 --> 00:26:07,558
If you wanna burn down your
relationship with our daughter,

418
00:26:07,561 --> 00:26:09,069
that's your business.

419
00:26:09,071 --> 00:26:12,366
But... don't ever try
to poison her against me.

420
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:15,244
Clear?

421
00:26:16,829 --> 00:26:18,080
- Of course.
- Yeah.

422
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,791
You look nice.

423
00:26:30,176 --> 00:26:32,843
- Thank you, Delores.
- Anytime.

424
00:26:32,845 --> 00:26:34,222
Have a good run, Kevin.

425
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:48,270
Oh, Kevin.

426
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:52,782
You precious, beautiful,
compulsive piece of trash.

427
00:27:51,257 --> 00:27:52,883
Hey, this is Archie.

428
00:27:53,843 --> 00:27:57,013
Okay, slow down. I can
barely... Are you sure?

429
00:27:58,298 --> 00:28:01,716
No, don't. Don't no no no no. Don't do
that. Just get somewhere safe, okay?

430
00:28:01,719 --> 00:28:04,928
We gonna turn back round to Hastings
Street. Stay calm. We're on our way OK.

431
00:28:43,939 --> 00:28:46,482
- This is where she said she was.
- Are you sure?

432
00:28:46,485 --> 00:28:49,632
Yes, I'm sure. Ethel? Ethel?

433
00:28:53,225 --> 00:28:54,445
Archie!

434
00:28:56,405 --> 00:28:57,987
Archie.

435
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:00,194
- Ethel, what happened?
- I was walking home

436
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:04,035
and this van just pulled up
and it circled back three times.

437
00:29:04,038 --> 00:29:07,665
- Did you see him? Did you recognize him?
- No. No, I'm sorry.

438
00:29:07,667 --> 00:29:09,625
- Are you okay? Don't be sorry.
- Yeah, I'm OK.

439
00:29:10,586 --> 00:29:13,506
- Where do you think he is?
- I don't know...

440
00:29:14,717 --> 00:29:17,220
Oh, my God. What are
you guys doing here?

441
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:22,471
Cheryl called me and said that you look like you
were going for a jog, headed towards Fox Forest.

442
00:29:22,473 --> 00:29:23,608
Fact.

443
00:29:24,976 --> 00:29:26,723
You said you weren't
gonna do this anymore.

444
00:29:26,726 --> 00:29:29,770
For God's sake, Betty,
what do you want from me?

445
00:29:29,772 --> 00:29:32,272
I want you to have more
respect for yourself than this.

446
00:29:32,274 --> 00:29:33,941
- Respect for myself?
- Yes.

447
00:29:33,943 --> 00:29:37,483
Look. We have been friends for a long
time, but you still have no idea...

448
00:29:37,486 --> 00:29:39,428
Well, then tell me, Kev, please.

449
00:29:39,431 --> 00:29:43,517
You act like we've got the same
set of options, but we don't.

450
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:49,148
You live in this pale-pink world
of milk shakes and first kisses

451
00:29:49,151 --> 00:29:51,693
and "Am I gonna date Archie or Jughead?"

452
00:29:51,696 --> 00:29:53,780
Except for when she's Dark Betty.

453
00:29:53,783 --> 00:29:58,207
Right, right, right. Except for when
you're exploring your BDSM sexuality,

454
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:01,846
which again, you're allowed to
do, but I'm not, because why?

455
00:30:02,847 --> 00:30:06,444
This is what I've got,
Betty. Me, these woods.

456
00:30:06,447 --> 00:30:10,198
So, please don't come here
and tell me it's disgusting.

457
00:30:10,201 --> 00:30:14,335
If you can't accept what I do,
whatever I do, then we're just...

458
00:30:14,338 --> 00:30:15,882
We're not really friends.

459
00:30:48,517 --> 00:30:50,352
Jughead.

460
00:30:51,817 --> 00:30:53,100
Jughead.

461
00:30:57,046 --> 00:30:58,131
Wait!

462
00:31:05,187 --> 00:31:07,106
How's the war on terror going?

463
00:31:07,917 --> 00:31:09,002
It's going.

464
00:31:09,991 --> 00:31:14,628
Oh. So, listen, um, about
this dinner with the Lodges.

465
00:31:15,511 --> 00:31:18,053
Hiram Lodge is more than
just your girlfriend's dad.

466
00:31:18,056 --> 00:31:20,306
He's my business partner.

467
00:31:20,309 --> 00:31:24,928
Ronnie and I both get that. And even if
things with us change, I'll be a gentleman.

468
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:29,319
I won't do anything to offend her or Mr.
and Mrs. Lodge. I promise, dad.

469
00:31:29,322 --> 00:31:33,659
Problem is, Hiram, he's
the kind of person who...

470
00:31:35,148 --> 00:31:39,444
Well, he'll find a way to be
offended if that's what he wants.

471
00:31:40,601 --> 00:31:42,561
- Just be careful, okay?
- Yeah.

472
00:31:45,826 --> 00:31:48,495
Can't you just take a day off?

473
00:31:49,371 --> 00:31:51,204
It's not that bad.

474
00:31:51,206 --> 00:31:52,855
Just some cuts and bruises.

475
00:31:52,858 --> 00:31:56,459
I told you that
motorcycle was risky, Jug.

476
00:31:56,461 --> 00:31:59,420
You promised me you were
always gonna wear a helmet.

477
00:31:59,422 --> 00:32:01,216
It was just around the block.

478
00:32:01,967 --> 00:32:04,676
Don't blame me, all
right? Blame the pothole.

479
00:32:04,678 --> 00:32:09,097
I thought you were gonna say that
you got jumped by those Creepies...

480
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:13,020
Ghoulies. But, no, the
Serpents won't allow that.

481
00:32:13,937 --> 00:32:15,397
They got Jughead's back.

482
00:32:16,094 --> 00:32:19,999
Even though he's not a member.
It's just family loyalty.

483
00:32:21,862 --> 00:32:27,325
Great, well... I've gotta go to school,
try and fix this mess with Kevin.

484
00:32:28,785 --> 00:32:32,664
- Toni, will you keep an eye on him for me?
- All over it.

485
00:32:39,504 --> 00:32:40,922
Don't tell Betty.

486
00:32:41,673 --> 00:32:43,256
She doesn't need to know.

487
00:32:43,258 --> 00:32:47,637
We warned you about the Ghoulies. I think
you'll take them a lot more seriously now.

488
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,641
Yeah.

489
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,519
I will now.

490
00:33:01,193 --> 00:33:03,403
The posole was really great, Mrs. Lodge.

491
00:33:04,738 --> 00:33:05,987
Glad you liked it.

492
00:33:05,989 --> 00:33:09,824
So, Veronica tells me you
rescued the Muggs girl.

493
00:33:09,826 --> 00:33:12,579
Yeah, but the creeper got away.

494
00:33:13,622 --> 00:33:16,247
We need to be a lot faster
with our response time.

495
00:33:16,249 --> 00:33:20,045
Yeah, because you'd like to be
ahead of the threat. I understand.

496
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:24,925
So, tell me, have you ever had rum?

497
00:33:25,675 --> 00:33:28,890
Rum? What, like the alcohol?

498
00:33:28,893 --> 00:33:32,974
Yeah, there's a signature
Lodge family label. It's...

499
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:37,020
I have some in my study.
Would you like to try it?

500
00:33:37,742 --> 00:33:38,910
Of course he would.

501
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,905
Oh, palomita, would you mind if Archie
and I had a little chat, man-to-man?

502
00:33:49,032 --> 00:33:51,034
Okay. Sure, Daddy.

503
00:34:02,003 --> 00:34:04,005
Poor little princess.

504
00:34:05,882 --> 00:34:09,135
The king will always
keep her at arm's length.

505
00:34:10,337 --> 00:34:13,840
She'll never be allowed
in his private throne room.

506
00:34:23,952 --> 00:34:25,235
Cab's waiting.

507
00:34:26,361 --> 00:34:29,155
Polly, are you sure this
is how you wanna leave?

508
00:34:30,448 --> 00:34:32,573
Without even telling them goodbye?

509
00:34:32,575 --> 00:34:35,120
- I know Mom's sorry.
- She's always sorry.

510
00:34:35,954 --> 00:34:37,872
Until she does the next thing.

511
00:34:38,515 --> 00:34:39,708
I'll be fine.

512
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:43,253
- I'll call you. I promise.
- Okay.

513
00:34:55,015 --> 00:34:59,144
I like having her up there,
looking over my shoulder.

514
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,602
Keeps me honest.

515
00:35:04,314 --> 00:35:05,525
Yeah.

516
00:35:06,484 --> 00:35:09,152
It's probably not the sort of thing
your father approves of, is it?

517
00:35:09,154 --> 00:35:11,573
Uh, rum? No, not... Not really, sir.

518
00:35:12,824 --> 00:35:14,951
No, I meant about your Red Circle.

519
00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:22,876
He's still trying to wrap his head
around it, I guess. Me too still.

520
00:35:23,543 --> 00:35:24,961
You know, Archie...

521
00:35:26,796 --> 00:35:28,798
I hope we can respect each other.

522
00:35:30,133 --> 00:35:32,135
You know, moving forward.

523
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,355
Yeah. Yes. Of course, Mr. Lodge.

524
00:35:37,265 --> 00:35:40,060
No more sneaking into
my daughter's bedroom.

525
00:35:41,127 --> 00:35:42,354
Ever.

526
00:35:45,065 --> 00:35:50,278
You know, and, uh, never...
ever... hurt Veronica.

527
00:35:52,572 --> 00:35:56,699
You know, I do have a thought
about your Red Circle, actually.

528
00:35:56,701 --> 00:35:59,118
You know, it's a noble idea.

529
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:03,625
But evil, Archie, has no regards
for nobility or good intention.

530
00:36:05,001 --> 00:36:09,297
You know, sometimes, defending
yourself, it's not enough.

531
00:36:10,048 --> 00:36:13,424
You need to, uh, strike
back. Go on the offensive.

532
00:36:13,426 --> 00:36:18,244
This Black Hood, he's waging
a war based on terror and fear.

533
00:36:18,247 --> 00:36:19,891
Those are his weapons.

534
00:36:25,063 --> 00:36:26,606
They should be yours, too.

535
00:36:31,569 --> 00:36:35,239
It's Kevin. Leave a message, if
people still do things like that.

536
00:36:54,134 --> 00:36:56,136
Hey. How's it going?

537
00:36:57,011 --> 00:37:00,502
- Kind of late to be out here.
- I'm waiting for someone.

538
00:37:00,505 --> 00:37:01,722
Is it me?

539
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:07,856
I could give you a ride. Drop
you somewhere. Come on, get in.

540
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:30,002
Moose and Midge were shot.
Tell me you won't go back there.

541
00:37:31,057 --> 00:37:35,089
- You know what? That's okay.
- What, you're playing hard-to-get?

542
00:37:35,091 --> 00:37:36,752
- Come on, get in.
- No, I'm not.

543
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:39,007
Get in the damn car, you little tease.

544
00:38:00,117 --> 00:38:01,408
It's late.

545
00:38:02,557 --> 00:38:03,696
Hi, Dad.

546
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,270
Where have you been?

547
00:38:06,999 --> 00:38:08,667
Betty had this thing.

548
00:38:09,163 --> 00:38:10,414
Don't lie to me, boy.

549
00:38:11,754 --> 00:38:14,298
Betty was here earlier, looking for you.

550
00:38:16,634 --> 00:38:22,264
We had a talk about...
what you've been doing.

551
00:38:36,111 --> 00:38:41,450
With everything that's going on
right now, I need to know you're safe.

552
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:43,327
You hear me?

553
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:45,955
You hear me?

554
00:38:50,744 --> 00:38:52,080
I know that, uh...

555
00:38:53,337 --> 00:38:56,048
there are certain things
that we don't talk about.

556
00:38:58,759 --> 00:39:01,428
Maybe it's time that we start trying.

557
00:39:04,525 --> 00:39:05,683
Okay?

558
00:39:09,144 --> 00:39:10,271
Okay, son.

559
00:39:17,361 --> 00:39:18,674
It's okay.

560
00:39:21,907 --> 00:39:23,409
Oh, I know that smile.

561
00:39:25,536 --> 00:39:27,246
- I've been thinking...
- Oh, boy.

562
00:39:28,706 --> 00:39:32,082
I want a more active
role in Lodge Industries.

563
00:39:32,084 --> 00:39:33,917
I mean I am a
shareholder, am I not?

564
00:39:33,919 --> 00:39:35,586
That's an honorary title, Veronica.

565
00:39:35,588 --> 00:39:37,840
Let's make it a real one, Daddy.

566
00:39:38,882 --> 00:39:40,509
I wanna get my hands dirty.

567
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:45,097
I wanna be in the room where it happens.

568
00:39:46,265 --> 00:39:49,349
Unless there's a reason
why I shouldn't be involved.

569
00:39:49,351 --> 00:39:51,351
Get a peek behind the curtain?

570
00:39:51,353 --> 00:39:53,564
No. None at all.

571
00:39:54,398 --> 00:39:56,940
Of course you should be involved.

572
00:39:56,942 --> 00:39:58,984
You're a Lodge, after all.

573
00:40:13,622 --> 00:40:15,002
Is this seat taken?

574
00:40:27,473 --> 00:40:30,601
Those kids in the fairy
tales who go into the woods...

575
00:40:31,944 --> 00:40:33,652
they don't come back the same.

576
00:40:33,655 --> 00:40:36,700
They're always changed
in some fundamental way.

577
00:40:39,568 --> 00:40:41,153
Sometimes for the better.

578
00:40:43,488 --> 00:40:45,407
More often for the worse.

579
00:40:46,311 --> 00:40:49,562
That's the common
misconception about fairy tales.

580
00:40:49,565 --> 00:40:54,268
They very rarely... have a happy ending.

581
00:40:54,271 --> 00:40:56,126
Doiley, is it recording?

582
00:40:57,503 --> 00:41:01,215
This is a message for the coward
calling himself the Black Hood.

583
00:41:02,925 --> 00:41:05,759
You think you can attack
us from the shadows.

584
00:41:05,761 --> 00:41:10,557
But Riverdale is a lot stronger
than you. And we're not afraid.

585
00:41:11,989 --> 00:41:14,281
See, there's only one of you.

586
00:41:14,284 --> 00:41:15,938
But we are legion.

587
00:41:17,345 --> 00:41:19,014
We're called the Red Circle.

588
00:41:20,189 --> 00:41:21,912
And we're coming for you.

589
00:41:30,135 --> 00:41:31,578
We will find you.

590
00:41:32,314 --> 00:41:33,747
We will hunt you.

591
00:41:34,545 --> 00:41:36,047
And we will end you.

592
