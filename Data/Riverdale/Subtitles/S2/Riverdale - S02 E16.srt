1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,204
Previously on Riverdale...

2
00:00:01,206 --> 00:00:02,364
I'm your uncle Claudius.

3
00:00:02,367 --> 00:00:04,338
Daddy never said anything
about having a brother.

4
00:00:04,341 --> 00:00:06,862
The Lodges. Have I dreamed
of getting my revenge on them.

5
00:00:06,865 --> 00:00:08,965
Now, now, Claudius. First things first.

6
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:10,400
Nana, then Cheryl.

7
00:00:10,402 --> 00:00:13,836
Effective immediately, Southside
High School is shut down!

8
00:00:13,838 --> 00:00:16,206
Okay guys, let's not overreact.

9
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:18,374
Hiram is like Dracula.
He's snapping up properties

10
00:00:18,376 --> 00:00:20,910
from all over Riverdale to
expand his empire and feed.

11
00:00:20,912 --> 00:00:22,879
Twilight Drive-in,
Sunnyside Trailer Park,

12
00:00:22,881 --> 00:00:24,981
Southside High and now,
Pops Chocolate Shop.

13
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:27,951
Southside High is
gonna be turned into...

14
00:00:27,953 --> 00:00:29,598
A private for-profit prison.

15
00:00:29,601 --> 00:00:31,988
We are leaving and we are leaving now!

16
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,085
Dad, I'm gonna stay.

17
00:00:33,088 --> 00:00:36,258
It's tradition. It's been in my
family going back generations.

18
00:00:36,261 --> 00:00:37,694
Now, Archie, we come first.

19
00:00:37,696 --> 00:00:40,063
If it's the only way I
can get Chic to open up...

20
00:00:40,065 --> 00:00:41,461
But catfishing him?

21
00:00:41,464 --> 00:00:43,497
When you wouldn't
submit to the DNA test,

22
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,202
I found some of your dental
floss, and sent it to the lab.

23
00:00:46,205 --> 00:00:48,524
You're not who you say you are, Chic.

24
00:00:50,641 --> 00:00:52,403
One sheet of paper.

25
00:00:52,406 --> 00:00:54,244
That's all it took.

26
00:00:54,247 --> 00:00:57,293
To confirm everything
Betty had feared...

27
00:00:57,296 --> 00:01:02,118
That she let a dangerous
stranger into her house.

28
00:01:03,703 --> 00:01:06,157
This is why you didn't want
to take the DNA test, isn't it?

29
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,027
Because you knew what the
results were gonna say.

30
00:01:08,029 --> 00:01:09,895
That you had no Blossom blood!

31
00:01:09,898 --> 00:01:12,362
Of course I don't. I'm not a
Blossom. I don't even know them.

32
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:15,474
Blossom blood is Cooper blood, Chic.

33
00:01:15,477 --> 00:01:19,412
My dad was a Blossom which means
you would have tested positively

34
00:01:19,415 --> 00:01:23,217
for Blossom DNA, but you didn't,
because you're an impostor!

35
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,500
Mom!

36
00:01:24,503 --> 00:01:25,995
Betty, listen.

37
00:01:25,998 --> 00:01:30,828
The truth is Chic's DNA doesn't match

38
00:01:30,831 --> 00:01:33,082
because Hal isn't his father.

39
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:36,586
But I am your mother, you understand me?

40
00:01:36,588 --> 00:01:38,288
Hang on, what?

41
00:01:39,089 --> 00:01:41,723
What? Then who is Chic's father?

42
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:43,750
Chic's my son!

43
00:01:43,753 --> 00:01:46,829
And whoever the father is, is
not gonna be a part of our lives.

44
00:01:46,831 --> 00:01:48,442
So there's no reason to open old

45
00:01:48,445 --> 00:01:51,335
wounds that have healed many times over!

46
00:01:52,804 --> 00:01:54,270
Come here.

47
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:07,750
Now, for our Register readers,

48
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:11,421
why would you, Hermione Lodge,
run for Mayor of Riverdale?

49
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,723
Every year, our population decreases.

50
00:02:13,725 --> 00:02:16,826
More and more businesses
close. We're at a deficit.

51
00:02:16,828 --> 00:02:19,429
We need to change that
equation before it's too late.

52
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:22,198
That is why Lodge
Industries has secured a bid

53
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,001
for a maximum security
prison on the Southside.

54
00:02:25,003 --> 00:02:28,037
Now, that means jobs,
economic growth, stability.

55
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,906
It'll give Riverdale its future back.

56
00:02:29,908 --> 00:02:31,407
You know, I have to ask.

57
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:34,811
You're building a prison
on the bones of a school.

58
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,879
Are you okay with that?

59
00:02:36,881 --> 00:02:38,981
Losing a school is a
tough pill to swallow,

60
00:02:38,983 --> 00:02:41,351
but once our correctional
facility is up and running,

61
00:02:41,353 --> 00:02:44,987
a quarter of our earnings are gonna
be funneled directly into education.

62
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:48,358
We are building a brand
new wing at Riverdale High.

63
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,028
And Veronica, are you gonna
follow in your mother's footsteps

64
00:02:53,031 --> 00:02:56,265
and run for Student Body
President in the upcoming election?

65
00:02:56,267 --> 00:02:59,936
Maybe. If I don't have my hands
full, campaigning for my mom.

66
00:02:59,938 --> 00:03:03,083
I'm excited to show Riverdale that
she's more than just a housewife.

67
00:03:03,086 --> 00:03:05,934
And speaking of housewives...

68
00:03:05,937 --> 00:03:07,877
We have a very special guest.

69
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:10,606
Bravo's very own Andy Cohen.

70
00:03:10,609 --> 00:03:12,949
Mr. Cohen, what brings you to Riverdale?

71
00:03:12,952 --> 00:03:17,153
I'm here to endorse my
great friend, Hermione Lodge.

72
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,489
She's a very savvy businesswoman.

73
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:22,325
She's always three steps
ahead of everyone around her.

74
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,594
She's a fighter too.
She doesn't give up.

75
00:03:24,597 --> 00:03:26,656
I'll love to have her in my corner.

76
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:29,698
Kevin just died and
went to clubhouse heaven.

77
00:03:29,701 --> 00:03:31,700
Thank you for letting
me invite him today, Mom.

78
00:03:31,703 --> 00:03:33,856
Of course. Any and all good will

79
00:03:33,859 --> 00:03:35,905
during this election will go a long way.

80
00:03:38,046 --> 00:03:40,476
And, 'Ronica...

81
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,147
This campaign isn't gonna be easy.

82
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:47,762
Especially since we had to lead with
your father's plans for the prison.

83
00:03:47,765 --> 00:03:52,864
Certain people in town and in
school are gonna see us as the enemy.

84
00:03:52,867 --> 00:03:55,090
So after the celebrity endorsement,

85
00:03:55,093 --> 00:03:57,827
let's keep our heads down
and let the storm pass.

86
00:03:57,829 --> 00:04:00,329
- Understand?
- Color me a wallflower.

87
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,348
Dad, I know you think
a prison is a bad idea

88
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:22,051
for Riverdale, but Mr. and Mrs. Lodge
really have thought this through.

89
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,253
A prison would rip
the soul of this town,

90
00:04:24,255 --> 00:04:27,890
especially the Southside, so
I'm not gonna support that plan.

91
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,525
Or Hiram and Hermione.

92
00:04:29,527 --> 00:04:32,762
I'm severing all ties with
Lodge Industries and SoDale.

93
00:04:32,764 --> 00:04:35,168
- All of it. I'm done.
- What? Just like that?

94
00:04:35,171 --> 00:04:36,694
- Yeah.
- Will they even let you walk away?

95
00:04:36,696 --> 00:04:38,611
I'm not asking his permission.

96
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:42,664
They will, or they'll have a
hell of a fight on their hands.

97
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:46,000
I just loved your spin piece
in the paper, Olivia Pope.

98
00:04:46,003 --> 00:04:47,495
Can we not, Jughead?

99
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:49,960
Did you know about Southside
High closing? Or the prison?

100
00:04:49,963 --> 00:04:53,507
Of course not. That was all
her parents' doing. Right, V?

101
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:59,101
She didn't know, Jughead,
okay? So, back off.

102
00:04:59,104 --> 00:05:02,968
Fine. I have to conserve
my energy anyhow.

103
00:05:02,971 --> 00:05:04,851
I'm going on a hunger strike

104
00:05:04,854 --> 00:05:08,730
to protest Southside High
closing and to get it reopened.

105
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:10,666
What?

106
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:13,750
I'm sorry, man. It's just...

107
00:05:13,753 --> 00:05:16,938
You're, like, always eating. I
mean, good luck with that, but...

108
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:19,742
Hey, it's Jughead's prerogative
to protest peacefully,

109
00:05:19,744 --> 00:05:21,577
so we're gonna support that, aren't we?

110
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:24,539
- Veronica?
- Oh, hey, Ethel.

111
00:05:24,542 --> 00:05:26,710
For your crimes against
the town of Riverdale,

112
00:05:26,713 --> 00:05:29,518
for everything that you and your
family have done and continue to do,

113
00:05:29,521 --> 00:05:32,522
we find you guilty.
Your sentence is this.

114
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:46,467
The chilling thing is

115
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,226
Ethel went through the trouble of

116
00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:51,570
bringing that milkshake here from Pop's.

117
00:05:51,573 --> 00:05:53,809
I mean, how mad is she?

118
00:05:55,213 --> 00:05:57,007
My dad is responsible for the Muggs

119
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,543
family losing basically everything.

120
00:05:59,546 --> 00:06:02,051
And he still hasn't made amends, so...

121
00:06:02,054 --> 00:06:04,487
Ethel has a right to be upset.

122
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,851
So do you.

123
00:06:05,854 --> 00:06:07,414
Are you sure you're okay?

124
00:06:09,127 --> 00:06:10,560
I'll manage.

125
00:06:10,563 --> 00:06:13,262
I'm impressed. I'd want
to rip Ethel's head off.

126
00:06:13,264 --> 00:06:15,075
As my mom keeps saying,

127
00:06:15,078 --> 00:06:18,634
this is not the time for drama
and flying off the handle.

128
00:06:19,404 --> 00:06:21,437
I just need to...

129
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,509
Take deep breaths, keep
smiling, turn the other cheek.

130
00:06:26,945 --> 00:06:28,611
Give Ethel a wide berth.

131
00:06:33,084 --> 00:06:34,317
Veronica!

132
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,485
I heard you got a face full of dairy.

133
00:06:36,487 --> 00:06:38,882
I've got some nuts to top
off that shake if you want.

134
00:06:38,885 --> 00:06:40,189
Leave her alone, Reggie.

135
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:42,747
You do not want to push
me right now, Reggie.

136
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,918
One question I gotta ask, as
future Student Body President.

137
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:47,734
What are the odds your dad's the first

138
00:06:47,737 --> 00:06:49,981
inmate in that prison he's building?

139
00:06:49,984 --> 00:06:51,739
Oh, man... That's...

140
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:02,687
...for your mom.

141
00:07:08,359 --> 00:07:11,765
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

142
00:07:24,109 --> 00:07:26,643
Who's there?

143
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:35,389
Oh, don't be ridiculous, Cheryl.

144
00:07:35,392 --> 00:07:37,754
No one was trying to break
into your room last night.

145
00:07:37,756 --> 00:07:39,192
You're imagining things.

146
00:07:39,195 --> 00:07:41,057
I swear, sometimes you're
worse than Nana Rose.

147
00:07:41,059 --> 00:07:42,692
I know what I heard and saw.

148
00:07:42,694 --> 00:07:44,168
Claudius, now that you're here,

149
00:07:44,171 --> 00:07:45,700
we should talk about you taking over

150
00:07:45,703 --> 00:07:47,478
Nana's stewardship of
the cereal business.

151
00:07:47,481 --> 00:07:51,101
That factory is mine! I'm
not dead yet, you vultures!

152
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:54,638
Oh, Mother! Now, come, come,
come, let's not get too upset.

153
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,740
Have some more of Penelope's tea.

154
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:58,942
It's a special blend that she makes.

155
00:08:06,718 --> 00:08:08,997
We're feeling a little
bit calmer this morning?

156
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,418
We are.

157
00:08:10,421 --> 00:08:12,389
I'm drink my High Point Decaffeinated.

158
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:14,291
So you won't be punching a boy today?

159
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,793
Again, I'm sorry, Mom.

160
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:23,133
Maybe if you'd offered Mr.
Muggs a job at the prison,

161
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:24,801
all of this could have been avoided.

162
00:08:24,803 --> 00:08:27,364
No, no, no. No, mija.

163
00:08:27,367 --> 00:08:29,539
We tell you what to do.

164
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:32,442
And right now, we're
telling you again...

165
00:08:32,444 --> 00:08:36,246
- Keep your head in the sand.
- Before it gets cut off.

166
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:41,084
We need you to be our
good, obedient little girl.

167
00:08:41,953 --> 00:08:43,453
You can do that, right?

168
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:51,394
Friends, I have an exciting
announcement to make.

169
00:08:51,396 --> 00:08:53,997
I'm running for Student
Council President

170
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:56,633
against Reggie "The Misogynist" Mantle.

171
00:08:56,635 --> 00:08:58,468
You've got to be kidding me.

172
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,604
If yesterday's dramatic
events taught me anything,

173
00:09:01,606 --> 00:09:04,407
it's that Veronica
Lodge is not a victim.

174
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,791
Nor will she ever
allow herself to be one.

175
00:09:06,794 --> 00:09:08,494
Your parents are taking over Riverdale

176
00:09:08,497 --> 00:09:10,864
and now you want to take over
our school? So what is this?

177
00:09:10,867 --> 00:09:12,533
Part of Mommy and Daddy's evil bidding?

178
00:09:12,536 --> 00:09:15,104
Jug, I get that you're in a bad
mood because you haven't eaten in...

179
00:09:15,106 --> 00:09:18,488
Actually, Jughead, my parents
think I should avoid the spotlight.

180
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,238
- Really?
- But I was born for elected office.

181
00:09:21,241 --> 00:09:24,527
V, if you want to be
President, you've got our vote.

182
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,397
Yeah, Team Ronnie all the way.

183
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,951
B? As the Thelma to my Louise,

184
00:09:29,954 --> 00:09:32,688
I can't imagine doing
this with anyone else.

185
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,538
Will you be my running mate?

186
00:09:37,609 --> 00:09:41,177
Of course, V. I'd be honored.

187
00:09:41,179 --> 00:09:44,464
Amaze! B and V!

188
00:09:44,467 --> 00:09:46,716
Now, that's a team you can believe in.

189
00:10:11,109 --> 00:10:14,394
Well, I doubt there's any way
you amateurs are gonna top that.

190
00:10:14,397 --> 00:10:16,511
So practice is over, Vixens.

191
00:10:16,514 --> 00:10:19,629
Inner circle Vixens, hang
back. You know who you are.

192
00:10:19,632 --> 00:10:24,087
In honor of Toni joining our
squad, I think we should celebrate

193
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,189
with a mandatory slumber
party at Thistlehouse.

194
00:10:26,191 --> 00:10:28,024
Fancy dressing gowns are appreciated.

195
00:10:28,026 --> 00:10:30,496
You've all seen The Beguiled, right?

196
00:10:30,499 --> 00:10:33,096
Dinner at 8:00. Parlor games to follow.

197
00:10:35,367 --> 00:10:37,344
And there's nothing I can
say to change your mind?

198
00:10:37,347 --> 00:10:39,914
'Fraid not. I just want to get
out of this thing, Hermione.

199
00:10:39,917 --> 00:10:41,704
As quickly, cleanly as I can.

200
00:10:41,706 --> 00:10:43,973
You go about your
business, I go about mine.

201
00:10:46,044 --> 00:10:47,377
I understand.

202
00:10:48,747 --> 00:10:51,339
And I will talk to Hiram.

203
00:10:51,342 --> 00:10:53,949
Of course, you know we'll need
to get our lawyers involved.

204
00:10:53,952 --> 00:10:57,287
Yeah, yeah. I kind of figured that.

205
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:00,525
What can you tell me about
Jughead's hunger strike?

206
00:11:01,593 --> 00:11:03,059
Yes, I heard about that.

207
00:11:04,062 --> 00:11:06,670
Jughead loves a political crusade

208
00:11:06,673 --> 00:11:08,231
almost as much as he does a burger.

209
00:11:08,233 --> 00:11:10,366
From the contact we've had,
your friend seems to live

210
00:11:10,368 --> 00:11:13,089
in a fantasy world of
ideals and theoreticals.

211
00:11:13,092 --> 00:11:15,705
What if Southside High were to reopen?

212
00:11:17,108 --> 00:11:19,375
I, on the otheothand,
live in the real world.

213
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:21,878
I see what needs to be done and I do it.

214
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,980
I think you do too, Archie.

215
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:28,952
I'm accelerating our timeline on
Southside High and I was wondering

216
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:32,455
if you could send Jughead a message.

217
00:11:33,684 --> 00:11:35,978
Yeah, whatever you
need, Mr. Lodge, but...

218
00:11:35,981 --> 00:11:37,178
But why you?

219
00:11:37,181 --> 00:11:41,010
Well, I think it'll soften the blow
to hear it coming from a friend.

220
00:11:41,013 --> 00:11:44,923
Hiram's trying to tear down Southside
High by the end of this week?

221
00:11:44,926 --> 00:11:48,227
He's supposed to give the neighborhood
at least a six weeks' notice.

222
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,897
Who'd he pay off? Can I have
another water, please, Pop?

223
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,300
Thank you.

224
00:11:53,044 --> 00:11:55,345
Jug, my dad got shot,

225
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:58,815
right here in Pops, because Riverdale
was sliding off the deep end.

226
00:11:58,817 --> 00:12:02,185
And if Mr. Lodge's
plan can shore things up

227
00:12:02,187 --> 00:12:05,522
and help make Riverdale more
secure for us and our families,

228
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:07,390
then I think that's a
good thing in my book.

229
00:12:07,392 --> 00:12:08,953
Besides, why do you care so much?

230
00:12:08,956 --> 00:12:11,590
You were only at Southside
High for like, four days!

231
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:15,867
You remember that I was
raised on the Southside, right?

232
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:18,701
My mom, my dad, Jellybean...

233
00:12:18,703 --> 00:12:21,905
That neighborhood is the last
tangible piece I have of them

234
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,674
until your dad comes
in with his bulldozers.

235
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:28,967
My dad's actually
against this whole thing.

236
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:32,152
He's pulling out of his
deal with the Lodges over it.

237
00:12:32,155 --> 00:12:34,817
You're choosing Hiram's side over his.

238
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:38,558
We see things differently,
okay? And it makes me sick.

239
00:12:38,561 --> 00:12:41,491
Kind of like when you and
your best friend are two trains

240
00:12:41,493 --> 00:12:44,863
running on the same track
in opposite directions,

241
00:12:44,866 --> 00:12:46,796
destined to collide?

242
00:12:58,276 --> 00:13:00,176
Inner circle, Cousin Betty?

243
00:13:00,178 --> 00:13:03,683
I didn't just bring you to
Thistlehouse for a girls' slumber party.

244
00:13:03,686 --> 00:13:06,916
The truth is I'm terrified
of being alone here.

245
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,233
There's a stranger in this house.

246
00:13:09,236 --> 00:13:11,553
My uncle Claudius,
he's as mad as the sea,

247
00:13:11,556 --> 00:13:14,123
and ever since he blew in, I
feel like I'm in mortal peril.

248
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,759
Wait, I'm confused. Is this
real or are we playing a game?

249
00:13:16,761 --> 00:13:18,795
All too real, TT.

250
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:21,130
I feel like they're plotting
against me and Nana Rose.

251
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:24,400
Mumsy cultivates esoteric
herbs in the conservatory.

252
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:27,637
Tannis root, jimsonweed. I'm afraid
to eat for fear of being poisoned.

253
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:32,827
Cheryl, are you sure
you're not imagining things?

254
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:36,324
Well, if she is, Josie,
then maybe I am too.

255
00:13:36,327 --> 00:13:39,082
There's a stranger in my life as well.

256
00:13:40,124 --> 00:13:44,621
Chic. With him lurking behind
every corner, my house feels...

257
00:13:44,631 --> 00:13:47,298
Dangerous. Deadly.

258
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,893
I sympathize.

259
00:14:07,245 --> 00:14:08,778
Full disclosure...

260
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:18,738
I didn't want to invite
all the girls tonight.

261
00:14:18,741 --> 00:14:22,925
But I knew my hideous mother would
never allow me to invite just you.

262
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,836
Which is...

263
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:29,165
what I craved.

264
00:14:50,989 --> 00:14:52,955
A fall like that should have killed her.

265
00:14:52,957 --> 00:14:56,206
- She's a lucky bird.
- Yes, that she is.

266
00:14:56,209 --> 00:14:59,206
Poor thing loses her
senses at nightfall.

267
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:01,431
It's classic Sundowner's Syndrome.

268
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,599
Cheryl, what is it?

269
00:15:04,369 --> 00:15:06,369
He's wearing my father's pajamas.

270
00:15:06,371 --> 00:15:08,371
- What?
- My uncle.

271
00:15:10,062 --> 00:15:14,431
Toni... I think they pushed
my nana down the stairs.

272
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,346
I think I'm next.

273
00:15:21,051 --> 00:15:23,651
All this contract stuff with the Lodges.

274
00:15:23,654 --> 00:15:25,788
Time to call in the big guns.

275
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,224
Now...

276
00:15:30,076 --> 00:15:33,644
I wish you'd called me in earlier, Fred,

277
00:15:33,647 --> 00:15:37,399
before you gave the Lodges
20% of Anderson Construction.

278
00:15:37,401 --> 00:15:40,002
Mr. Lodge said he'll work
this out. He'll keep his word.

279
00:15:40,004 --> 00:15:41,570
Yeah. Son...

280
00:15:41,572 --> 00:15:44,340
Your mother and I have known the
Lodges a lot longer than you have.

281
00:15:44,342 --> 00:15:46,942
- Meaning what, Dad?
- Archie!

282
00:15:48,845 --> 00:15:51,130
It's okay. I better
get to school anyway.

283
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:52,746
I'm helping Veronica with her campaign.

284
00:15:52,749 --> 00:15:54,482
Are we still on for lunch, Mom?

285
00:16:00,424 --> 00:16:02,224
Hands where I can see them.

286
00:16:03,961 --> 00:16:06,595
Here you go. Now remember,
vote Lodge-Cooper.

287
00:16:06,597 --> 00:16:08,831
Okay, who's next?

288
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:11,400
The cupcakes have been flown in
from Magnolia Bakery in New York

289
00:16:11,402 --> 00:16:14,336
but the kisses, however,
are locally sourced.

290
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,308
Uh, five minute hydration break.

291
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:22,126
Ethel, wait!

292
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:24,313
Sexualizing the election, Veronica?

293
00:16:24,315 --> 00:16:27,596
Well, it might get you the boys,
but you can forget about the girls.

294
00:16:27,599 --> 00:16:31,787
Right now, I'm only
interested in one girl. You.

295
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:35,758
Look, I know it's long overdue,
but I wanna make reparations.

296
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,993
So I'm working it out with my parents,

297
00:16:37,996 --> 00:16:42,541
and you can tell your dad to expect
a great job offer very, very soon.

298
00:16:42,551 --> 00:16:47,190
This isn't a demolition notice.
It's a notice of extermination.

299
00:16:47,193 --> 00:16:50,072
We've already said our
goodbye to Southside, Jughead.

300
00:16:50,074 --> 00:16:54,743
Today, it's Southside High.
Tomorrow, it's the world.

301
00:16:54,746 --> 00:16:57,581
Everything that makes the Southside home

302
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:00,182
is gonna disappear.

303
00:17:01,552 --> 00:17:04,687
If we roll over now, it's all over.

304
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:08,991
- It's just a building, Jug.
- No! Toni, it's the soul of the Southside.

305
00:17:10,094 --> 00:17:14,713
They fought and died
trying to protect that land.

306
00:17:14,716 --> 00:17:19,235
Our parents fought to keep
it safe during the riots.

307
00:17:20,871 --> 00:17:24,573
Now it's our turn. It's our time.

308
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:28,377
This is our fight. So who's with me?

309
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,573
Who's ready to go to war?

310
00:17:34,576 --> 00:17:38,287
Archie, I really hate to see
you and your father fighting.

311
00:17:38,289 --> 00:17:39,888
We're not, Mom.

312
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,957
And look, you and Veronica,

313
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:44,487
it's your first real relationship...

314
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:48,497
I just wanna make sure
that you're not being...

315
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,232
led astray.

316
00:17:51,235 --> 00:17:52,568
By Ronnie?

317
00:17:53,904 --> 00:17:57,806
To align yourself with her family
against your better judgment.

318
00:17:57,808 --> 00:18:00,509
It's not like that. Okay?
Veronica is an amazing person.

319
00:18:00,511 --> 00:18:02,878
I'm sure she is.

320
00:18:02,887 --> 00:18:06,222
But I guess I'm just
saying, so's your dad.

321
00:18:08,966 --> 00:18:11,787
- Just...
- The best you can get.

322
00:18:11,789 --> 00:18:14,290
Can't get any more...

323
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:22,063
What the hell's going on here?

324
00:18:22,066 --> 00:18:25,301
Chic invited me over. Cookie?

325
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,836
No, thanks.

326
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:30,973
How do you guys even know each other?

327
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:32,741
It's a funny story.

328
00:18:32,743 --> 00:18:35,721
Kevin and I have been
continuing our online chats.

329
00:18:35,724 --> 00:18:38,414
Imagine my surprise
when he finally told me

330
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:41,150
it all started as a catfishing
scheme you cooked up.

331
00:18:42,586 --> 00:18:44,787
- Kev, you sold me out.
- I felt bad.

332
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:46,357
Okay, Kev, you need to leave.

333
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,524
I need to talk to my
brother alone. Right now.

334
00:18:48,526 --> 00:18:50,526
Betty, you're really
kicking me out, right now?

335
00:18:50,528 --> 00:18:53,662
- Mmm-hmm.
- It's okay, Kev. I'll catch you later.

336
00:18:57,968 --> 00:19:01,196
Do not mess with my friends.

337
00:19:01,199 --> 00:19:02,935
Mess with?

338
00:19:02,938 --> 00:19:04,907
What do you think I'm doing here, Betty?

339
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:06,608
Clearly, there's something you want.

340
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:09,057
Some void you're looking to fill here.

341
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,146
Like brother, like sister, right?

342
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:14,830
"We share the same darkness."
Isn't that what you said?

343
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,852
Yeah, I guess I was wrong.

344
00:19:17,662 --> 00:19:20,296
You know nothing about my darkness.

345
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,346
But you will.

346
00:19:27,564 --> 00:19:32,963
Josie? Look, I know things haven't
been smooth sailing between us.

347
00:19:32,966 --> 00:19:35,304
Are we even on speaking terms, Veronica?

348
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,506
I mean, you did steal
the Pussycats from me.

349
00:19:37,508 --> 00:19:39,975
Borrowed them after you dumped them.

350
00:19:39,977 --> 00:19:41,777
What do you want, Veronica?

351
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:44,613
A celebrity endorsement for my campaign.

352
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:47,620
Yours. And before you say no...

353
00:19:47,623 --> 00:19:52,421
Andy Cohen is a very old,
very good friend of the family.

354
00:19:53,124 --> 00:19:54,523
Okay, my ears are perked

355
00:19:54,525 --> 00:19:57,860
Because I never miss an episode
of Watch What Happens: Live.

356
00:19:57,862 --> 00:20:00,195
- How would you like to be on it?
- What?

357
00:20:00,197 --> 00:20:03,593
- As a special guest.
- Okay, if you can make that happen...

358
00:20:03,596 --> 00:20:05,634
Consider yourself endorsed.

359
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:07,301
Amazing.

360
00:20:07,304 --> 00:20:12,708
My point is, Hermione, some may
read this document as exploitative.

361
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,510
Come on now, Mary. Now, that's not fair.

362
00:20:14,512 --> 00:20:16,509
Look, fair would be an immediate and

363
00:20:16,512 --> 00:20:18,614
compensated release from the contract.

364
00:20:18,616 --> 00:20:20,349
How does that sound, everyone?

365
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,818
Oh, sorry. It keeps buzzing.

366
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:26,288
Hiram here.

367
00:20:28,615 --> 00:20:29,981
They're doing what?

368
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,533
Mr. Lodge?

369
00:20:39,904 --> 00:20:41,336
What?

370
00:20:42,239 --> 00:20:43,806
Yeah, don't worry. I'm on it.

371
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:56,296
Well, well, well. The
cavalry's finally here.

372
00:20:56,299 --> 00:20:58,299
Guess that means we've
got Hiram's attention.

373
00:20:58,302 --> 00:20:59,729
Are you nuts?

374
00:20:59,732 --> 00:21:01,557
Chaining yourself to this place?

375
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,226
They're gonna tear it
down in two days, dude.

376
00:21:04,228 --> 00:21:07,999
Not unless Hiram wants the blood of
eight young Serpents on his hands.

377
00:21:08,009 --> 00:21:09,905
We're not going anywhere.

378
00:21:10,631 --> 00:21:12,565
Go and tell your boss we said that.

379
00:21:28,185 --> 00:21:29,818
Hello, brother.

380
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,120
Betty, what...

381
00:21:33,432 --> 00:21:38,369
You think you're the only one who
can scare people by being crazy?

382
00:21:38,372 --> 00:21:41,864
You may have fooled
my mother, but not me.

383
00:21:43,133 --> 00:21:45,234
I'm gonna bring you down.

384
00:21:47,512 --> 00:21:50,819
Because I catch bad men.

385
00:21:50,822 --> 00:21:54,443
I caught Clifford Blossom.
I caught the Sugarman.

386
00:21:55,846 --> 00:21:57,843
I caught the Black Hood.

387
00:21:57,846 --> 00:22:01,783
And you know what they all
have in common? They're dead.

388
00:22:03,053 --> 00:22:05,020
Consider yourself warned.

389
00:22:17,707 --> 00:22:19,840
God, why didn't you
call me last night, Jug?

390
00:22:19,842 --> 00:22:22,074
I would have brought you
and your crew blankets.

391
00:22:22,077 --> 00:22:23,677
You would have tried to stay the night.

392
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,713
Are you sure you're
not gonna get arrested

393
00:22:25,715 --> 00:22:29,717
for trespassing or
protesting without a permit?

394
00:22:29,726 --> 00:22:33,664
Oh, that's the beauty
of all this, Betty.

395
00:22:33,667 --> 00:22:36,891
See, if Sheriff Keller and his goons
try and manhandle a bunch of teens

396
00:22:36,893 --> 00:22:38,492
peacefully trying to save their former

397
00:22:38,495 --> 00:22:40,566
school, it's just gonna look ugly.

398
00:22:40,576 --> 00:22:43,871
Not to mention, probably
go viral, which...

399
00:22:43,874 --> 00:22:46,821
at this point, it is
publicity I would welcome.

400
00:22:48,011 --> 00:22:51,045
Also, no one's gonna mess
with those guys over there.

401
00:22:52,508 --> 00:22:54,075
Good point.

402
00:22:54,078 --> 00:22:57,044
I have some Student Council
obligations with Veronica,

403
00:22:57,046 --> 00:22:59,246
but I'll be back later tonight, okay?

404
00:23:00,817 --> 00:23:02,516
Go get 'em, Tracy Flick.

405
00:23:03,785 --> 00:23:06,246
We live in uncertain times,

406
00:23:06,249 --> 00:23:09,322
but here's one thing
I'm very certain of...

407
00:23:09,325 --> 00:23:13,494
My girl Ronnie here, along with
her running mate, Betty Cooper,

408
00:23:13,497 --> 00:23:18,418
has my vote to be Riverdale High's
next President and Vice President.

409
00:23:18,421 --> 00:23:22,524
And of course, we remind
everyone, especially the women,

410
00:23:22,527 --> 00:23:24,905

411
00:23:29,146 --> 00:23:32,171

421
00:24:19,228 --> 00:24:20,761
Okay, what's going on?

422
00:24:25,268 --> 00:24:28,302
- Where did you get all this information?
- Does it matter?

423
00:24:28,305 --> 00:24:30,171
It's the truth, isn't it?

424
00:24:30,174 --> 00:24:31,995
I don't understand.

425
00:24:31,998 --> 00:24:33,697
I told you that we were making amends,

426
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,308
that your dad would get a job offer.

427
00:24:35,311 --> 00:24:37,546
You mean, your half-hearted bribe?

428
00:24:37,549 --> 00:24:39,446
Yeah. Too little, too late.

429
00:24:42,084 --> 00:24:43,684
B, wait!

430
00:24:45,087 --> 00:24:46,887
This is insane.

431
00:24:51,494 --> 00:24:55,187
- Thanks for the intel, Josie.
- No problem.

432
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:58,010
The Lodges hurt a lot
of people this year.

433
00:24:58,013 --> 00:25:00,480
Your family, my family...

434
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:03,876
We girls, we gotta to stick together.

435
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:08,776
That day in the student lounge

436
00:25:08,778 --> 00:25:11,111
when Weatherbee announced that
Southside High was closing,

437
00:25:11,113 --> 00:25:13,214
you acted like you didn't know.

438
00:25:13,217 --> 00:25:15,816
When my parents asked me to help them,

439
00:25:15,819 --> 00:25:18,651
I didn't feel like I could say no.

440
00:25:18,654 --> 00:25:20,888
Of course you could've.

441
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,685
You could've told your parents that you

442
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,525
didn't want to be their teen accomplice,

443
00:25:24,527 --> 00:25:26,860
or you could have told us the truth.

444
00:25:26,862 --> 00:25:29,063
Instead, you just played us like fools!

445
00:25:29,065 --> 00:25:31,632
No, I was just trying
to keep them honest!

446
00:25:31,635 --> 00:25:34,602
That's why I started working with
them. Betty, you have to believe me.

447
00:25:34,605 --> 00:25:39,307
Even if I dil I can't be your running
mate anymore. You know that, right?

448
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:43,978
I can't trust you, V.

449
00:25:52,555 --> 00:25:54,639
Veronica...

450
00:25:54,642 --> 00:25:56,542
Rough day on the campaign trail?

451
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:01,211
- How did you find out about that?
- Weatherbee called.

452
00:26:04,207 --> 00:26:07,174
He also read me the flyer
that's been going around school.

453
00:26:07,177 --> 00:26:09,670
Now do you see why we asked
you to keep a low profile?

454
00:26:09,673 --> 00:26:13,770
And instead, you're running for
Student Council President. Why?

455
00:26:13,773 --> 00:26:16,098
Because, Mom...

456
00:26:16,101 --> 00:26:19,168
I'm out there every day, facing what you

457
00:26:19,171 --> 00:26:21,350
and Daddy have done, what we've done.

458
00:26:21,353 --> 00:26:23,917
And maybe, if I'm their President,

459
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:29,423
people at school like Ethel
Muggs or Jughead or even Betty

460
00:26:30,493 --> 00:26:31,757
will stop looking at me

461
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,928
like I'm just the daughter of
criminals, like I'm a criminal too.

462
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:37,698
We're out there
fighting a holy war, Mom.

463
00:26:37,701 --> 00:26:40,921
I need something I can use as a shield

464
00:26:40,924 --> 00:26:43,606
against everything
that's coming our way.

465
00:26:43,609 --> 00:26:47,908
Protection from everybody
out there who hates us,

466
00:26:47,911 --> 00:26:49,999
who's out for our blood.

467
00:26:54,691 --> 00:26:58,025
Stop right there, young
lady. Come in here now!

468
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:02,356
Is it true that you snuck into
your brother's room last night

469
00:27:02,358 --> 00:27:04,591
to torment him with a Zippo lighter?

470
00:27:04,593 --> 00:27:06,960
And what exactly is this for?

471
00:27:06,962 --> 00:27:10,698
Oh, my God, you creep! What did you
do, go through my dresser drawers?

472
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:14,201
I was looking for the lighter as
proof and found all your secret toys.

473
00:27:14,203 --> 00:27:16,603
Why, in God's name, do
you have this cabaret wig?

474
00:27:16,605 --> 00:27:18,372
She wears it when she
has sex with Jughead!

475
00:27:19,108 --> 00:27:20,859
Is that true, Elizabeth?

476
00:27:20,862 --> 00:27:22,095
I...

477
00:27:24,714 --> 00:27:27,676
How would you even know that?

478
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,156
- I was guessing.
- Guessing?

479
00:27:33,823 --> 00:27:38,459
Betty, what... Is it,
is it true? Are you...

480
00:27:39,595 --> 00:27:42,785
Are you and Jughead...

481
00:27:42,788 --> 00:27:44,765
Yeah, Mom. We are.

482
00:27:54,877 --> 00:27:56,624
Last man standing.

483
00:27:57,952 --> 00:28:00,514
What happened to no Serpent left behind?

484
00:28:00,517 --> 00:28:03,117
Ah, they were claimed by frostbite.

485
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,019
They'll be back after some
coffee. They'll warm up.

486
00:28:06,021 --> 00:28:08,021
Too bad. I got a dozen burgers.

487
00:28:08,831 --> 00:28:10,965
Guess they're all yours now.

488
00:28:13,094 --> 00:28:15,128
Come on, boy. It's just you and me.

489
00:28:15,131 --> 00:28:17,798
I'm not gonna tell anyone
you broke your hunger strike.

490
00:28:21,254 --> 00:28:23,121
So, uh...

491
00:28:24,381 --> 00:28:27,549
Just like clockwork, I
got a call from Hiram.

492
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:30,144
What's he offering this time?

493
00:28:30,147 --> 00:28:31,931
You know how they're saying SoDale

494
00:28:31,934 --> 00:28:33,714
will mostly be low income housing?

495
00:28:33,716 --> 00:28:38,318
Well, apparently, there'll be
a few penthouses at the top.

496
00:28:39,724 --> 00:28:43,459
Would be more than enough space for
all of us. Your mom, Jellybean...

497
00:28:44,827 --> 00:28:46,727
Just like you always wanted.

498
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:48,976
Just imagine me,

499
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:52,577
standing on that balcony
and looking over a prison...

500
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:57,871
Right in the same spot that all my
friends and I used to go to school.

501
00:29:00,943 --> 00:29:04,912
And Jellybean, growing
up in a town where...

502
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,817
Best hope, or only
hope aside from getting

503
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,570
the hell out, is to work at the prison?

504
00:29:16,492 --> 00:29:17,925
It's not right.

505
00:29:18,778 --> 00:29:20,411
What'd you say to him?

506
00:29:20,414 --> 00:29:24,298
Nothing. I hung up on his ass and
went to Pop's and got some burgers.

507
00:29:30,372 --> 00:29:32,473
I was hoping to see
Jughead while I was in town.

508
00:29:32,475 --> 00:29:35,509
He's still at Southside High,
Mom, chained up like a lunatic.

509
00:29:35,511 --> 00:29:38,145
Arch, you might not believe
in what he's fighting for...

510
00:29:38,148 --> 00:29:42,716
I'm not sure he's
fighting for anything, Dad.

511
00:29:42,718 --> 00:29:45,352
I think he's mostly
fighting against Mr. Lodge.

512
00:29:45,354 --> 00:29:47,621
Like a lot of people in
this town who are afraid.

513
00:29:47,623 --> 00:29:50,891
- Archie!
- Afraid? Afraid of what?

514
00:29:50,893 --> 00:29:54,127
Afraid of having a vision, of
seeing what has to done and doing it.

515
00:29:56,032 --> 00:29:58,866
I hope that you're not
referring to your father, Archie.

516
00:29:58,868 --> 00:30:01,602
This man who broke rocks
when he was in high school,

517
00:30:01,604 --> 00:30:04,037
to support his family
when his dad was sick.

518
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:07,207
A man who saw what had
to be done and did it.

519
00:30:07,209 --> 00:30:09,409
And built a business out of nothing.

520
00:30:09,411 --> 00:30:12,246
One that pays for this house
and the food you eat every day.

521
00:30:12,248 --> 00:30:16,517
And for your information, your father
had and has a vision for Riverdale.

522
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:18,390
One that doesn't, thank God, end up

523
00:30:18,393 --> 00:30:20,521
with everyone working in a penal colony.

524
00:30:20,523 --> 00:30:22,422
Now, you don't have to
side with your dad, okay?

525
00:30:22,424 --> 00:30:25,192
You can side with Hiram Lodge,
even though he's a crook,

526
00:30:25,194 --> 00:30:26,555
and has no intention of letting your

527
00:30:26,557 --> 00:30:28,122
father out of that contract, by the way.

528
00:30:28,124 --> 00:30:30,864
You can do that. That is
your right. But I'll be damned

529
00:30:30,866 --> 00:30:33,788
if I'm gonna sit here and
listen to you disrespect him!

530
00:30:53,242 --> 00:30:56,104
Betty, I have to ask...

531
00:30:56,107 --> 00:30:58,646
Are you being safe with Jughead?

532
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,781
Yes, Mom. Of course.

533
00:31:00,783 --> 00:31:02,350
Well, that's something.

534
00:31:03,753 --> 00:31:07,463
Because look, when I was
your age, I wasn't always.

535
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:11,791
But you need to be, and
I am very well acquainted

536
00:31:11,794 --> 00:31:15,752
with how alluring the Jones men are.

537
00:31:15,755 --> 00:31:18,888
Whoa. Wait, Mom...

538
00:31:18,891 --> 00:31:21,479
Did you and FP...

539
00:31:21,482 --> 00:31:25,206
I mean, is it possible
that FP is Chic's dad?

540
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:27,166
Absolutely not.

541
00:31:27,169 --> 00:31:30,778
But Chic is a part of our family.

542
00:31:30,781 --> 00:31:34,048
He's your brother. I
know that he's odd...

543
00:31:34,983 --> 00:31:38,918
and damaged. I see that, I'm not blind.

544
00:31:38,921 --> 00:31:41,255
But for the past 25 years,

545
00:31:41,258 --> 00:31:43,892
he hasn't had anyone to love him.

546
00:31:43,895 --> 00:31:45,872
He's dangerous.

547
00:31:46,896 --> 00:31:49,597
Mom, don't forget what he did.

548
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:51,399
I will never forget, Betty.

549
00:31:52,605 --> 00:31:54,305
But Chic needs us.

550
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:10,151
Dr. Masters?

551
00:32:10,154 --> 00:32:11,986
Any updates on my nana?

552
00:32:11,988 --> 00:32:13,821
Yes, we just got her panel back.

553
00:32:13,823 --> 00:32:18,125
There was a trace amount of a
paralytic toxin in her bloodstream.

554
00:32:18,127 --> 00:32:21,328
Tannis root, which is
strange because it's so rare.

555
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:23,531
But as your mother
and uncle explained it,

556
00:32:23,533 --> 00:32:25,566
they've caught your Nana
on more than one occasion

557
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:29,033
chewing bits of tannis root
she grows in your greenhouse.

558
00:32:29,036 --> 00:32:31,169
So, it's more of her
Sundowner's Syndrome.

559
00:32:31,172 --> 00:32:32,786
We'll keep her for
observation another day,

560
00:32:32,788 --> 00:32:34,510
then she should be well
enough to return home.

561
00:32:34,512 --> 00:32:37,244
To my mother and uncle? No, Dr.
Masters, you don't understand...

562
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:39,513
Cheryl! There you are.

563
00:32:39,515 --> 00:32:41,816
Looking a little worse for wear.

564
00:32:41,818 --> 00:32:43,984
Poor dear, hasn't slept in days.

565
00:32:43,986 --> 00:32:45,886
Why don't we stop bothering Dr. Masters

566
00:32:45,888 --> 00:32:47,908
and I'll take you straight home?

567
00:32:47,911 --> 00:32:49,511
Come on.

568
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,833
Mom says we should bury the hatchet.

569
00:32:59,836 --> 00:33:02,450
So for her sake, how about a truce?

570
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:09,067
Why should I believe you when all
you've done is try to get rid of me?

571
00:33:10,146 --> 00:33:13,947
If I really wanted to
get rid of you, Chic,

572
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,151
I would go down to the Sheriff's
office and explain to him

573
00:33:17,153 --> 00:33:19,753
how you brained a man in our kitchen.

574
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:23,902
You're not gonna do that.

575
00:33:26,863 --> 00:33:29,666
You see, I never
touched that body, Betty.

576
00:33:29,669 --> 00:33:32,933
Or the car. Or went through his phone,

577
00:33:32,935 --> 00:33:36,804
or called his contacts. I
didn't go to the sewer pipe.

578
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:40,549
It's not my fingerprints
or hair they're gonna find.

579
00:33:40,552 --> 00:33:42,776
You know, maybe I
should call the police,

580
00:33:42,778 --> 00:33:45,579
tell them what sort of things
my sister's capable of doing.

581
00:33:45,582 --> 00:33:46,982
You wouldn't dare.

582
00:33:49,418 --> 00:33:51,886
You know, I don't think I'm
comfortable being in the same room

583
00:33:51,888 --> 00:33:53,921
as someone who's done
those sorts of things.

584
00:33:54,957 --> 00:33:57,189
It scares me, Betty.

585
00:33:57,192 --> 00:34:00,455
You scare me. Can't you see that?

586
00:34:00,458 --> 00:34:04,398
You're scaring me,
Betty. You're scaring me!

587
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:16,050
I think I figured it out.

588
00:34:17,647 --> 00:34:20,347
You paralyzed Nana Rose
with the tannis root.

589
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,515
And then pushed her down the stairs.

590
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,353
You've gone mad.

591
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:28,355
That's all there is to it.

592
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:33,594
You have lost your mind
and you leave us no choice.

593
00:34:35,856 --> 00:34:37,965
What do you mean, no choice?

594
00:34:37,967 --> 00:34:39,733
But it's all right.

595
00:34:41,337 --> 00:34:44,071
We're gonna make you all better.

596
00:34:46,809 --> 00:34:48,409
All better.

597
00:34:49,812 --> 00:34:53,814
Every hour that passes
that Jughead is out there

598
00:34:53,817 --> 00:34:55,950
is bad for business.

599
00:34:55,953 --> 00:34:59,420
It's time to remove Jughead and
his fellow Serpents by force.

600
00:34:59,422 --> 00:35:02,556
Grown-ups going after teenagers?
Wouldn't that be bad for business?

601
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:06,093
If Sheriff Keller and
his men do it, yes.

602
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,955
But boys, led bravely by you?

603
00:35:09,958 --> 00:35:13,287
The wrestling team. No one
would be too upset by that.

604
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:14,790
I can't.

605
00:35:16,038 --> 00:35:17,771
I'm sorry. I won't.

606
00:35:19,583 --> 00:35:23,072
Archie, you made a promise to me.

607
00:35:23,075 --> 00:35:26,313
An oath to this family
in this very room.

608
00:35:28,784 --> 00:35:30,919
If you break it, there
will be consequences.

609
00:35:30,922 --> 00:35:32,121
I understand.

610
00:35:33,114 --> 00:35:36,357
So you'll help me?

611
00:35:38,186 --> 00:35:39,686
Yes, sir.

612
00:35:44,356 --> 00:35:47,768
But I hope you can prove
your loyalty to me in return.

613
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:49,770
Hmm. And how would I do that?

614
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:53,775
By releasing my dad from all
commitments to Lodge Industries.

615
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:01,682
Save our school! Save our school!

616
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:27,755
Cops may let you by, Red,

617
00:36:27,758 --> 00:36:30,544
but you come in here acting like a
big man and I will knock you down.

618
00:36:30,553 --> 00:36:33,954
Dad, don't! They'll throw you in
jail. Don't give him an excuse.

619
00:36:35,718 --> 00:36:37,700
I'm sorry, Jughead.

620
00:36:39,457 --> 00:36:40,923
Me too.

621
00:36:42,892 --> 00:36:44,725
I'm not gonna fight you, Archie.

622
00:36:46,696 --> 00:36:48,262
Look around.

623
00:36:49,494 --> 00:36:50,963
It may have taken a couple of days,

624
00:36:50,966 --> 00:36:53,205
but now people know what Hiram's doing,

625
00:36:53,208 --> 00:36:55,035
what's happening here.

626
00:36:55,037 --> 00:36:59,073
This fight is not gonna go
away. We're not gonna go away.

627
00:37:00,476 --> 00:37:03,077
So go on, cut us down.

628
00:37:03,813 --> 00:37:05,846
I want them to see you do it.

629
00:37:57,494 --> 00:37:59,545
You think it even made any difference?

630
00:37:59,548 --> 00:38:02,547
- Us freezing our asses off?
- Definitely.

631
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:06,751
Every revolution starts somewhere.

632
00:38:06,753 --> 00:38:07,852
Good.

633
00:38:08,988 --> 00:38:13,421
'Cause I've been thinking,
we lost Southside High.

634
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:15,857
I don't want to lose Riverdale High too.

635
00:38:18,531 --> 00:38:20,305
And you've not heard more unlikely

636
00:38:20,308 --> 00:38:22,335
words come from my mouth, Betty, but...

637
00:38:28,821 --> 00:38:31,088
I wanna run for Student Body President.

638
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,543
And I want you to be my co-president.

639
00:38:35,556 --> 00:38:37,815
- I know that you and Veronica...
- Okay.

640
00:38:40,594 --> 00:38:41,827
Really?

641
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:44,088
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

642
00:38:45,429 --> 00:38:47,029
I'm in, Jug.

643
00:38:47,904 --> 00:38:50,004
There is no me and Veronica.

644
00:38:52,601 --> 00:38:54,652
You have to do me a favor, though.

645
00:38:57,704 --> 00:38:59,670
You have to let me stay here.

646
00:39:01,736 --> 00:39:04,537
I can't stay in the same
house as Chic anymore.

647
00:39:07,954 --> 00:39:09,454
Okay.

648
00:39:17,256 --> 00:39:18,771
Okay.

649
00:39:20,927 --> 00:39:22,393
What's going on?

650
00:39:22,396 --> 00:39:24,649
Your pal Hiram Lodge called.

651
00:39:24,652 --> 00:39:26,805
He's letting your dad
out of his contract.

652
00:39:26,808 --> 00:39:29,600
Well, I never doubted
your mom for a second.

653
00:39:29,602 --> 00:39:32,215
- I knew she'd do it.
- Wow. That's...

654
00:39:32,218 --> 00:39:33,745
That's great.

655
00:39:33,748 --> 00:39:35,306
Yeah, and another thing, son, your

656
00:39:35,309 --> 00:39:37,041
mother and I have been talking, and...

657
00:39:37,044 --> 00:39:39,031
I'm gonna stick around for a while,

658
00:39:39,034 --> 00:39:42,104
help your dad with some
more unfinished business.

659
00:39:42,107 --> 00:39:45,516
That contract was the last
thing holding him back.

660
00:39:46,676 --> 00:39:47,976
From what?

661
00:39:49,856 --> 00:39:51,911
I'm gonna run for Mayor.

662
00:39:51,914 --> 00:39:55,226
Against the Lodges, come what may.

663
00:40:03,653 --> 00:40:05,502
Mrs. Blossom, hi.

664
00:40:05,505 --> 00:40:09,006
I'm looking for Cheryl. She wasn't
at the hospital with her nana.

665
00:40:09,008 --> 00:40:10,541
No, she's gone.

666
00:40:10,543 --> 00:40:12,610
Boarding school in Switzerland.

667
00:40:12,613 --> 00:40:15,029
All girls. She left just last night.

668
00:40:15,032 --> 00:40:18,582
Mrs. Blossom, that
doesn't make any sense.

669
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:20,151
Don't come here again.

670
00:40:53,064 --> 00:40:55,607
Oh, honey. Poor child.

671
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:57,988
There's nothing to be afraid of.

672
00:40:59,455 --> 00:41:01,755
Sister Woodhouse is going to help you.

673
00:41:01,765 --> 00:41:04,753
Thank you, Sister Woodhouse.

674
00:41:04,756 --> 00:41:09,066
Yeah, she's gonngo rid you
of all those naughty demons.

675
00:41:10,336 --> 00:41:14,572
The ones making you think
such awful, unnatural thoughts.

676
00:41:15,908 --> 00:41:19,343
Today, you must rest.

677
00:41:21,162 --> 00:41:23,279
Tomorrow...

678
00:41:23,282 --> 00:41:27,651
The real work. The conversion begins.
