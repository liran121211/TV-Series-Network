1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,665
- [narrator] Previously on Riverdale:
- I'm your Uncle Claudius.

2
00:00:02,666 --> 00:00:04,543
Daddy never said anything
about having a brother.

3
00:00:04,544 --> 00:00:07,001
The Lodges. Have I dreamt
of getting my revenge on them.

4
00:00:07,084 --> 00:00:10,379
Now, Claudius, first things first,
Nana then Cheryl.

5
00:00:10,463 --> 00:00:13,716
Effective immediately,
Southside High School is shut down.

6
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,928
- Okay, let's not overreact.
- [Jughead] Hiram is like Dracula.

7
00:00:17,011 --> 00:00:20,598
He's snapping up properties
to expand his empire and feed.

8
00:00:20,681 --> 00:00:23,851
Twilight Drive-In, Sunnyside Trailer Park,
Southside High,

9
00:00:23,935 --> 00:00:27,605
- and Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe.
- Southside High will be turned into...

10
00:00:27,688 --> 00:00:31,734
- A private, for-profit prison.
- We are leaving, and we are leaving now.

11
00:00:31,817 --> 00:00:34,946
- Dad, I'll stay.
- This tradition has been in my family

12
00:00:35,029 --> 00:00:37,823
going back generations.
Archie, we come first.

13
00:00:37,907 --> 00:00:39,825
The only way I can get Chic
to open up...

14
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:41,160
But catfishing him?

15
00:00:41,244 --> 00:00:43,162
[Betty] When you wouldn't submit
the DNA test,

16
00:00:43,246 --> 00:00:45,957
I found your dental floss
and sent it to the lab.

17
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,209
You're not who you say you are,
Chic.

18
00:00:50,503 --> 00:00:52,004
[Jughead] One sheet of paper.

19
00:00:52,588 --> 00:00:56,259
That's all it took to confirm everything
Betty had feared.

20
00:00:57,385 --> 00:01:01,639
That she'd let a dangerous stranger
into her house.

21
00:01:03,724 --> 00:01:05,935
This is why you didn't want
the DNA test.

22
00:01:06,018 --> 00:01:09,564
Because you knew the results.
You have no Blossom blood.

23
00:01:09,647 --> 00:01:12,191
I don't. I'm not a Blossom.
I don't know them.

24
00:01:12,275 --> 00:01:16,862
Blossom blood is Cooper blood, Chic.
My dad was a Blossom,

25
00:01:16,946 --> 00:01:21,242
which means you would've tested positively
for Blossom DNA, but you didn't

26
00:01:21,325 --> 00:01:22,743
because you're an imposter.

27
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:24,870
- Mom.
- [Alice] Betty, listen.

28
00:01:26,122 --> 00:01:29,875
The truth is, Chic's DNA doesn't match...

29
00:01:31,043 --> 00:01:32,920
because Hal isn't his father.

30
00:01:34,171 --> 00:01:37,883
- But I am your mother, you understand me?
- Hang on. What?

31
00:01:38,926 --> 00:01:42,638
- What? Then who is Chic's father?
- Chic's my son.

32
00:01:44,015 --> 00:01:46,809
Whoever the father is
won't be a part of our lives.

33
00:01:46,892 --> 00:01:51,063
There's no reason to open old wounds
that have healed many times over.

34
00:01:52,732 --> 00:01:53,858
Come here.

35
00:02:04,118 --> 00:02:07,413
Now, for our Register readers,

36
00:02:07,496 --> 00:02:11,292
why would you, Hermione Lodge,
run for mayor of Riverdale?

37
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:13,586
Every year, our population decreases,

38
00:02:13,669 --> 00:02:16,964
more and more businesses close.
We're at a deficit.

39
00:02:17,048 --> 00:02:19,675
We need to change that
before it's too late.

40
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:23,971
That is why Lodge Industries has secured
a bid for a maximum security prison

41
00:02:24,055 --> 00:02:27,892
on the Southside. Now, that means jobs,
economic growth, stability.

42
00:02:27,975 --> 00:02:30,978
- It'll give Riverdale its future back.
- I have to ask.

43
00:02:31,437 --> 00:02:34,607
You're building a prison
on the bones of a school.

44
00:02:35,316 --> 00:02:36,692
Are you okay with that?

45
00:02:36,776 --> 00:02:41,197
Losing a school is a tough pill
to swallow, but once our facility is up,

46
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,950
a quarter of our earnings
are gonna be funneled into education.

47
00:02:45,034 --> 00:02:47,828
We are building a brand-new wing
at Riverdale High.

48
00:02:49,789 --> 00:02:54,460
And, Veronica, are you going to follow
and run for student body president

49
00:02:54,543 --> 00:02:58,089
- in the upcoming election?
- Maybe, if I don't have my hands full

50
00:02:58,172 --> 00:02:59,715
campaigning for my mom.

51
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:02,927
I'm excited to show Riverdale
she's more than a housewife.

52
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:07,723
And speaking of housewives,
we have a very special guest,

53
00:03:07,807 --> 00:03:12,520
Bravo's very own Andy Cohen.
Mr. Cohen, what brings you to Riverdale?

54
00:03:13,187 --> 00:03:17,149
I'm here to endorse my great friend,
Hermione Lodge.

55
00:03:17,316 --> 00:03:19,276
She's a very savvy businesswoman,

56
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,987
always three steps ahead
of everyone around her.

57
00:03:22,071 --> 00:03:26,283
She's a fighter, too. She doesn't give up.
I'd love to have her in my corner.

58
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:29,453
[Veronica] Kevin just died
and went to Clubhouse heaven.

59
00:03:29,537 --> 00:03:32,665
- Thank you for letting me invite him, Mom.
- Of course.

60
00:03:32,748 --> 00:03:36,085
Any and all goodwill during this election
will go a long way.

61
00:03:38,087 --> 00:03:39,880
And, Veronica...

62
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:43,968
this campaign isn't gonna be easy

63
00:03:44,218 --> 00:03:47,638
since we had to lead
with your father's plans for the prison.

64
00:03:47,805 --> 00:03:52,143
Certain people in town and in school
are gonna see us as the enemy.

65
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:56,272
After this endorsement,
let's keep our heads down,

66
00:03:56,355 --> 00:03:59,859
- let the storm pass, understand?
- Color me a wallflower.

67
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:19,211
Dad, I know you think a prison
is a bad idea for Riverdale,

68
00:04:19,295 --> 00:04:22,006
but Mr. and Mrs. Lodge
have thought this through.

69
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:25,342
A prison would rip the soul out
of the Southside.

70
00:04:25,426 --> 00:04:29,430
So, I'm not gonna support that plan,
or Hiram and Hermione.

71
00:04:29,513 --> 00:04:33,976
I'm severing ties with Lodge Industries
and SoDale. All of it. I'm done.

72
00:04:34,059 --> 00:04:36,562
Just like that?
Will they let you walk away?

73
00:04:36,645 --> 00:04:38,272
I'm not asking his permission.

74
00:04:38,522 --> 00:04:42,026
They will, or they'll have
a hell of a fight on their hands.

75
00:04:42,568 --> 00:04:45,780
I just loved your spin piece
in the paper, Olivia Pope.

76
00:04:45,863 --> 00:04:47,364
Can we not, Jughead?

77
00:04:47,448 --> 00:04:49,742
Did you know about Southside High closing?
Or the prison?

78
00:04:49,825 --> 00:04:52,995
Of course not. That was all
her parents' doing. Right, V?

79
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,584
She didn't know, Jughead, okay?
So, back off.

80
00:04:59,126 --> 00:05:01,796
Fine. I have to conserve my energy anyhow.

81
00:05:02,922 --> 00:05:06,926
I'm going on a hunger strike
to protest Southside High closing

82
00:05:07,468 --> 00:05:09,595
- and to get it reopened.
- [chuckles]

83
00:05:09,678 --> 00:05:11,055
What?

84
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:13,557
Sorry, man, it's just...

85
00:05:13,641 --> 00:05:16,560
You're always eating.
Good luck with that, but...

86
00:05:16,644 --> 00:05:19,772
Hey, it's Jughead's prerogative
to protest peacefully,

87
00:05:19,855 --> 00:05:22,858
- so, we're gonna support that, aren't we?
- Veronica?

88
00:05:22,942 --> 00:05:24,360
Oh, hey, Ethel.

89
00:05:24,443 --> 00:05:28,239
For your crimes against Riverdale,
everything your family has done

90
00:05:28,322 --> 00:05:32,243
and continue to do, we find you guilty.
Your sentence is this.

91
00:05:33,327 --> 00:05:34,453
[gasps]

92
00:05:44,713 --> 00:05:47,800
The chilling thing is
Ethel went through the trouble

93
00:05:47,883 --> 00:05:50,928
of bringing that milkshake here
from Pop's.

94
00:05:51,887 --> 00:05:53,430
I mean, how mad is she?

95
00:05:54,932 --> 00:05:59,061
My dad is responsible for the Muggs family
losing basically everything.

96
00:05:59,687 --> 00:06:02,189
And he still hasn't made amends, so...

97
00:06:02,273 --> 00:06:05,401
- [sighs] Ethel has a right to be upset.
- So do you.

98
00:06:05,985 --> 00:06:07,486
Are you sure you're okay?

99
00:06:08,988 --> 00:06:09,822
I'll manage.

100
00:06:10,364 --> 00:06:13,492
I'm impressed.
I'd wanna rip Ethel's head off.

101
00:06:13,576 --> 00:06:16,954
As my mom keeps saying,
"This is not the time for drama

102
00:06:17,037 --> 00:06:18,664
and flying off the handle."

103
00:06:19,123 --> 00:06:20,040
I just need...

104
00:06:21,542 --> 00:06:25,212
to take deep breaths, keep smiling,
turn the other cheek.

105
00:06:26,797 --> 00:06:28,299
Give Ethel a wide berth.

106
00:06:33,095 --> 00:06:36,307
Veronica, I heard you got
a face full of dairy.

107
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:40,144
- I've got some nuts to top off that shake.
- Leave her alone, Reggie.

108
00:06:40,227 --> 00:06:42,438
You do not wanna push me right now.

109
00:06:42,521 --> 00:06:45,899
One question I gotta ask
as future student body president:

110
00:06:45,983 --> 00:06:48,485
What are the odds
your dad's the first inmate

111
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:52,114
in that prison he's building?
Oh, man, that's heavy.

112
00:06:52,197 --> 00:06:56,035
He'd be considered one of us.
Or is he building a female prison, too?

113
00:06:56,493 --> 00:06:57,995
For your mom? Maybe I'll visit...

114
00:07:00,998 --> 00:07:01,832
For your mom?

115
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,630
== Synced & corrected by <font color="#00FFFF">MaxPayne</font> ==

116
00:07:25,854 --> 00:07:27,105
Who's there?

117
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:37,825
Oh, don't be ridiculous, Cheryl. No one
was trying to break into your room.

118
00:07:37,908 --> 00:07:40,994
You're imagining things.
You're worse than Nana Rose.

119
00:07:41,078 --> 00:07:45,040
- I know what I heard and saw.
- Claudius, we should talk about you

120
00:07:45,123 --> 00:07:48,168
taking over Nana's stewardship
of the syrup business.

121
00:07:48,252 --> 00:07:51,338
That factory's mine.
I'm not dead yet, you vultures.

122
00:07:51,421 --> 00:07:54,591
Oh, Mother, now, come, come.
Let's not get too upset.

123
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:59,263
Have some more of Penelope's tea.
It's a special blend that she makes.

124
00:08:07,062 --> 00:08:09,147
Are we feeling calmer this morning?

125
00:08:09,231 --> 00:08:12,484
We are.
I'm drinking my High Point decaffeinated.

126
00:08:12,568 --> 00:08:16,613
- So, you won't be punching a boy today?
- Again, I'm sorry, Mom.

127
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,870
Maybe if you'd offered Mr. Muggs
a job at the prison,

128
00:08:23,453 --> 00:08:27,082
- all of this could've been avoided.
- Oh, no, no, no. No, mija.

129
00:08:27,624 --> 00:08:29,167
We tell you what to do.

130
00:08:30,085 --> 00:08:34,256
And right now, we're telling you, again,
keep your head in the sand.

131
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:36,174
Before it gets cut off.

132
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:40,971
We need you to be our good,
obedient little girl.

133
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:43,849
You can do that, right?

134
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:51,231
[Veronica] Friends, I have an exciting
announcement to make.

135
00:08:51,648 --> 00:08:54,234
I'm running for student council president

136
00:08:54,318 --> 00:08:58,447
- against Reggie "the Misogynist" Mantle.
- [groans] You've gotta be kidding me.

137
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:01,700
If yesterday's dramatic events
taught me anything,

138
00:09:01,783 --> 00:09:06,914
it's that Veronica Lodge is not a victim,
nor will she ever allow herself to be one.

139
00:09:06,997 --> 00:09:10,208
Your parents are taking over Riverdale,
you wanna take over school?

140
00:09:10,292 --> 00:09:12,294
What is this, part of Mommy
and Daddy's evil bidding?

141
00:09:12,377 --> 00:09:15,464
I get you're in a bad mood
because you haven't eaten...

142
00:09:15,547 --> 00:09:18,675
Actually, my parents think
I should avoid the spotlight.

143
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:21,511
- Really?
- But I was born for elected office.

144
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:24,556
V, if you wanna be president,
you've got our vote.

145
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,811
- Yeah, Team Ronnie all the way.
- B, as the Thelma to my Louise,

146
00:09:29,895 --> 00:09:32,606
I couldn't imagine doing this
with anyone else.

147
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:35,025
Will you be my running mate?

148
00:09:37,861 --> 00:09:39,529
Of course, V.

149
00:09:40,072 --> 00:09:42,449
- I'd be honored.
- Amaze.

150
00:09:42,908 --> 00:09:46,495
B and V. Now, that's a team
you can believe in.

151
00:09:48,372 --> 00:09:50,624
[DJ OLFO's "Rumbamba"
playing on speakers]

152
00:10:04,846 --> 00:10:05,764
[music stops]

153
00:10:11,436 --> 00:10:15,023
I don't think there's any way
you amateurs are gonna top that,

154
00:10:15,107 --> 00:10:16,775
so practice is over, Vixens.

155
00:10:16,858 --> 00:10:19,194
Inner circle Vixens, hang back.
You know who you are.

156
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:22,489
In honor of Toni joining our squad,

157
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:26,493
I think we should celebrate
with a slumber party at Thistlehouse.

158
00:10:26,576 --> 00:10:30,247
Fancy dressing gowns are appreciated.
You've all seen The Beguiled.

159
00:10:31,081 --> 00:10:33,208
Dinner at 8, parlor games to follow.

160
00:10:35,544 --> 00:10:37,462
And there's nothing I can say
to change your mind?

161
00:10:37,546 --> 00:10:40,132
Afraid not.
I just wanna get out of this thing.

162
00:10:40,215 --> 00:10:44,344

Riverdale was sliding off the deep end.

00:20:42,485 --> 00:20:44,195
Yeah, don't worry. I'm on it.

330
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:58,376
Well, well, well, cavalry's finally here.
Guess that means we got Hiram's attention.

331
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,212
Are you nuts?
Chaining yourself to this place?

332
00:21:01,838 --> 00:21:04,174
They're gonna tear it down in two days.

333
00:21:04,257 --> 00:21:08,261
Not unless Hiram wants the blood
of eight young Serpents on his hands.

334
00:21:08,345 --> 00:21:09,846
We're not going anywhere.

335
00:21:10,513 --> 00:21:12,724
Go and tell your boss we said that.

336
00:21:28,239 --> 00:21:30,992
- Hello, brother.
- Betty, what...?

337
00:21:33,536 --> 00:21:37,874
You think you're the only one
who can scare people by being crazy?

338
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:41,669
You may have fooled my mother, but not me.

339
00:21:43,171 --> 00:21:44,672
I'm gonna bring you down.

340
00:21:47,675 --> 00:21:50,387
Because I catch bad men.

341
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,847
I caught Clifford Blossom.

342
00:21:52,931 --> 00:21:54,265
I caught the Sugarman.

343
00:21:55,767 --> 00:21:59,938
I caught the Black Hood.
And you know what they all have in common?

344
00:22:00,939 --> 00:22:01,773
They're dead.

345
00:22:03,024 --> 00:22:04,901
Consider yourself warned.

346
00:22:17,747 --> 00:22:19,958
God, why didn't you call me last night?

347
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:21,960
I would have brought you blankets.

348
00:22:22,043 --> 00:22:23,795
And you would've tried to stay.

349
00:22:23,878 --> 00:22:27,382
Are you sure you're not gonna get arrested
for trespassing

350
00:22:27,465 --> 00:22:29,884
or protesting without a permit?

351
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,094
No.

352
00:22:31,678 --> 00:22:33,805
That's the beauty of all this, Betty.

353
00:22:33,888 --> 00:22:36,975
If Sheriff Keller or his goons try
and manhandle teens

354
00:22:37,058 --> 00:22:40,270
peacefully trying to save their school,
it'll look ugly.

355
00:22:40,937 --> 00:22:44,065
Not to mention probably go viral, which...
[sighs]

356
00:22:44,482 --> 00:22:47,110
At this point,
is publicity I would welcome.

357
00:22:48,153 --> 00:22:50,822
Also, no one's gonna mess
with those guys there.

358
00:22:53,158 --> 00:22:57,245
Good point. I have some student council
obligations with Veronica.

359
00:22:57,328 --> 00:22:59,539
But I'll be back later tonight, okay?

360
00:23:01,082 --> 00:23:02,750
Go get them, Tracy Flick.

361
00:23:04,085 --> 00:23:06,212
[Josie] We live in uncertain times.

362
00:23:06,296 --> 00:23:09,632
But here's one thing I'm very certain of:

363
00:23:09,716 --> 00:23:13,469
My girl Ronnie here,
along with her running mate, Betty Cooper,

364
00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:18,600
has my vote to be Riverdale High's
next president and vice president.

365
00:23:18,683 --> 00:23:20,810
And, of course, we remind everyone,

366
00:23:20,894 --> 00:23:24,939
especially the women,
to vote and be heard this election.

367
00:23:25,023 --> 00:23:26,316

[music stops]

384
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:28,503
- Where did you get this information?
- Doesn't matter.

385
00:24:28,586 --> 00:24:30,088
It's the truth, isn't it?

386
00:24:30,546 --> 00:24:31,673
I don't understand.

387
00:24:32,173 --> 00:24:35,218
I told you
that your dad would get a job offer.

388
00:24:35,301 --> 00:24:39,097
You mean your half-hearted bribe?
Yeah, too little, too late.

389
00:24:42,183 --> 00:24:43,559
B, wait.

390
00:24:45,061 --> 00:24:46,479
This is insane.

391
00:24:51,651 --> 00:24:53,319
Thanks for the intel, Josie.

392
00:24:53,778 --> 00:24:54,612
No problem.

393
00:24:55,738 --> 00:24:58,116
The Lodges hurt a lot of people this year.

394
00:24:58,408 --> 00:25:00,493
Your family, my family.

395
00:25:02,203 --> 00:25:04,038
We girls gotta stick together.

396
00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:11,212
That day when Weatherbee announced
that Southside High was closing,

397
00:25:11,296 --> 00:25:13,464
you acted like you didn't know.

398
00:25:13,548 --> 00:25:15,800
When my parents asked me to help them,

399
00:25:16,592 --> 00:25:20,680
- I didn't feel like I could say no.
- Of course you could've.

400
00:25:20,763 --> 00:25:24,809
You could've told your parents that you
didn't wanna be their accomplice,

401
00:25:24,892 --> 00:25:26,936
or you could've told us the truth.

402
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,105
Instead, you played us like fools.

403
00:25:29,188 --> 00:25:33,776
No, I was trying to keep them honest.
That's why I started working with them.

404
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:36,154
- You have to believe me.
- Even if I did...

405
00:25:36,237 --> 00:25:39,449
I can't be your running mate anymore.
You know that.

406
00:25:42,118 --> 00:25:43,619
I can't trust you, V.

407
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:54,047
Veronica?

408
00:25:54,881 --> 00:25:57,175
Rough day on the campaign trail?

409
00:25:58,885 --> 00:26:01,596
- How did you find out?
- Weatherbee called.

410
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:07,143
He read me the flyer
that's going around school.

411
00:26:07,226 --> 00:26:09,812
See why we asked you
to keep a low profile?

412
00:26:09,896 --> 00:26:13,566
And instead, you're running
for student council president? Why?

413
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:15,443
Because, Mom...

414
00:26:16,861 --> 00:26:18,363
I'm out there, every day,

415
00:26:18,654 --> 00:26:21,574
facing what you and Daddy have done,
what we've done.

416
00:26:21,699 --> 00:26:23,659
And maybe if I'm their president,

417
00:26:24,118 --> 00:26:27,205
people at school,
like Ethel Muggs or Jughead or...

418
00:26:28,206 --> 00:26:33,378
Or even Betty... will stop looking at me
like I'm just the daughter of criminals.

419
00:26:33,461 --> 00:26:37,632
Like I'm a criminal, too.
We're out there fighting a holy war, Mom.

420
00:26:37,715 --> 00:26:40,343
I need something I can use as a shield.

421
00:26:41,219 --> 00:26:43,638
Against everything that's coming our way.

422
00:26:44,097 --> 00:26:47,392
Protection from everybody out there
who hates us.

423
00:26:48,351 --> 00:26:49,769
Who's out for our blood.

424
00:26:54,732 --> 00:26:56,484
[Alice] Stop right there, young lady.

425
00:26:56,567 --> 00:26:57,777
Come in here now.

426
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:02,198
Is it true that you snuck
into your brother's room

427
00:27:02,281 --> 00:27:04,784
to torment him with a Zippo lighter?

428
00:27:04,867 --> 00:27:06,994
And what exactly is this for?

429
00:27:07,078 --> 00:27:10,957
Oh, my God. You creep. What did you do,
go through my dresser drawers?

430
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,667
I was looking for the lighter

431
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:16,546
- and found all your secret toys.
- Why do you have this Cabaret wig?

432
00:27:16,629 --> 00:27:19,006
She wears it
when she has sex with Jughead.

433
00:27:19,465 --> 00:27:21,050
Is that true, Elizabeth?

434
00:27:21,342 --> 00:27:22,427
I...

435
00:27:24,929 --> 00:27:27,306
How would you even know that?

436
00:27:28,933 --> 00:27:30,059
I was guessing.

437
00:27:30,143 --> 00:27:30,977
Guessing?

438
00:27:33,729 --> 00:27:34,647
Betty. What...?

439
00:27:35,731 --> 00:27:36,941
Is it...? Is it true?

440
00:27:37,733 --> 00:27:38,568
Are you-?

441
00:27:39,861 --> 00:27:41,237
Are you and Jughead...?

442
00:27:43,239 --> 00:27:44,699
Yeah, Mom, we are.

443
00:27:55,042 --> 00:27:56,502
Last man standing.

444
00:27:58,171 --> 00:28:00,548
What happened to no Serpent left behind?

445
00:28:01,048 --> 00:28:05,803
They were claiming frostbite. They'll be
back after some coffee and they warm up.

446
00:28:05,887 --> 00:28:07,930
Too bad. I got a dozen burgers.

447
00:28:09,223 --> 00:28:10,892
Guess they're all yours now.

448
00:28:13,436 --> 00:28:18,232
Come on, it's just you and me. I won't
tell anyone you broke your hunger strike.

449
00:28:21,486 --> 00:28:22,320
So, uh...

450
00:28:24,447 --> 00:28:27,116
just like clockwork,
I got a call from Hiram.

451
00:28:28,743 --> 00:28:31,829
- What's he offering?
- You know how they're saying SoDale

452
00:28:31,913 --> 00:28:34,123
will mostly be low-income housing?

453
00:28:34,207 --> 00:28:38,377
Well, apparently, there'll be
a few penthouses at the top.

454
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:43,758
It would be more than enough space
for all of us. Your mom, Jellybean.

455
00:28:44,884 --> 00:28:46,803
Just like you always wanted.

456
00:28:46,886 --> 00:28:48,054
Just imagine me...

457
00:28:49,722 --> 00:28:52,725
standing on that balcony
and looking over a prison.

458
00:28:55,019 --> 00:28:58,356
In the same spot that my friends
and I used to go to school.

459
00:29:01,234 --> 00:29:04,570
And Jellybean, growing up in a town...

460
00:29:05,988 --> 00:29:09,575
where her best hope, her only hope,
aside from getting the hell out,

461
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:11,035
is to work at the prison?

462
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:13,037
[grunts]

463
00:29:16,707 --> 00:29:17,625
It's not right.

464
00:29:19,335 --> 00:29:21,838
- What'd you say to him?
- Nothing. I hung up

465
00:29:21,921 --> 00:29:24,257
and went to Pop's and got some burgers.

466
00:29:30,471 --> 00:29:32,682
I was hoping to see Jughead.

467
00:29:32,765 --> 00:29:35,685
He's still at Southside High, Mom,
chained up.

468
00:29:35,768 --> 00:29:38,563
You may not believe
in what he's fighting for...

469
00:29:38,646 --> 00:29:41,941
I'm not sure he's fighting
for anything, Dad.

470
00:29:42,984 --> 00:29:47,488
I think he's fighting against Mr. Lodge,
like people in this town who are afraid.

471
00:29:47,572 --> 00:29:50,825
- Archie.
- Afraid? Afraid of what?

472
00:29:50,908 --> 00:29:54,912
Afraid of having a vision, of seeing
what has to be done and doing it.

473
00:29:56,455 --> 00:29:58,916
I hope you're not referring
to your father.

474
00:29:59,208 --> 00:30:01,669
This man who broke rocks
when he was in school

475
00:30:01,752 --> 00:30:04,171
to support his family
when his dad was sick.

476
00:30:04,255 --> 00:30:07,425
A man who saw what had
to be done and did it,

477
00:30:07,508 --> 00:30:09,635
and built a business out of nothing.

478
00:30:09,719 --> 00:30:12,471
One that pays for this house
and the food you eat.

479
00:30:12,555 --> 00:30:16,475
For your information, your father
had and has a vision for Riverdale,

480
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:20,479
one that doesn't end up
with everyone working in a penal colony.

481
00:30:20,563 --> 00:30:22,690
You don't have to side with your dad.

482
00:30:22,773 --> 00:30:25,484
You can side with Hiram,
even though he's a crook

483
00:30:25,568 --> 00:30:28,237
and has no intention
of letting your father out.

484
00:30:28,321 --> 00:30:29,947
You can do that. That is your right.

485
00:30:30,031 --> 00:30:34,243
But I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit here
and listen to you disrespect him.

486
00:30:53,262 --> 00:30:55,681
Betty, I have to ask.

487
00:30:56,641 --> 00:30:59,894
- Are you being safe with Jughead?
- Yes, Mom.

488
00:31:00,269 --> 00:31:02,688
- Of course.
- Well, that's something.

489
00:31:04,315 --> 00:31:07,526
Because, look,
when I was your age, I wasn't always.

490
00:31:08,235 --> 00:31:09,362
But you need to be.

491
00:31:09,612 --> 00:31:15,034
And I am very well acquainted
with how alluring the Jones men are.

492
00:31:16,327 --> 00:31:20,498
Whoa. Wait. Mom, did you and FP...?

493
00:31:21,791 --> 00:31:25,378
I mean, is it possible
that FP is Chic's dad?

494
00:31:25,461 --> 00:31:26,462
Absolutely not.

495
00:31:27,713 --> 00:31:32,259
But Chic is a part of our family.
He's your brother.

496
00:31:32,843 --> 00:31:35,888
I know that he's odd and damaged.

497
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:39,100
I see that. I'm not blind.

498
00:31:39,183 --> 00:31:43,604
But for the past 25 years,
he hasn't had anyone to love him.

499
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:46,148
He's dangerous.

500
00:31:47,024 --> 00:31:49,735
Mom, don't forget what he did.

501
00:31:49,819 --> 00:31:51,445
I will never forget, Betty.

502
00:31:52,738 --> 00:31:54,156
But Chic needs us.

503
00:32:08,838 --> 00:32:09,714
[Cheryl] Dr. Masters?

504
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:14,176
- Any updates on my nana?
- Yes, we just got her panel back.

505
00:32:15,011 --> 00:32:18,180
There was a paralytic toxin
in her bloodstream.

506
00:32:18,264 --> 00:32:21,142
Tannis root. Which is strange,
because it's so rare.

507
00:32:21,225 --> 00:32:25,604
Your mom and uncle have caught your nana
on more than one occasion

508
00:32:25,688 --> 00:32:28,399
chewing Tannis root
she grows in your greenhouse.

509
00:32:28,482 --> 00:32:31,402
So, it's more of her sundowner syndrome.

510
00:32:31,485 --> 00:32:34,613
We'll keep her another day,
then she'll return home.

511
00:32:34,697 --> 00:32:37,408
To my mother and uncle?
You don't understand...

512
00:32:37,491 --> 00:32:41,537
Cheryl. There you are.
Looking a little worse for wear.

513
00:32:42,121 --> 00:32:44,165
Poor dear hasn't slept in days.

514
00:32:44,248 --> 00:32:47,835
Why don't we stop bothering Dr. Masters
and I'll take you home?

515
00:32:48,544 --> 00:32:49,420
Come on.

516
00:32:49,503 --> 00:32:50,337
Sorry.

517
00:32:58,012 --> 00:33:02,141
Mom says we should bury the hatchet.
So, for her sake, how about a truce?

518
00:33:03,225 --> 00:33:04,060
[scoffs]

519
00:33:06,687 --> 00:33:09,732
Why should I believe you when all
you've done is try to get rid of me?

520
00:33:10,441 --> 00:33:13,861
If I really wanted
to get rid of you, Chic...

521
00:33:14,904 --> 00:33:17,448
I would go to the sheriff's office
and explain to him

522
00:33:17,531 --> 00:33:19,992
how you brained a man in our kitchen.

523
00:33:22,411 --> 00:33:24,246
You're not gonna do that.

524
00:33:27,124 --> 00:33:29,752
You see, I never touched that body, Betty.

525
00:33:30,169 --> 00:33:34,632
Or the car. Or went
through his phone, or called his contacts.

526
00:33:34,715 --> 00:33:36,717
I didn't go to the sewer pipe.

527
00:33:37,676 --> 00:33:40,554
It's not my fingerprints or hair
they're gonna find.

528
00:33:41,097 --> 00:33:45,601
Maybe I should call the police, tell them
what my sister is capable of doing.

529
00:33:45,684 --> 00:33:47,353
You wouldn't dare.

530
00:33:49,939 --> 00:33:52,691
I'm not comfortable
being in a room with someone

531
00:33:52,775 --> 00:33:54,151
who's done those things.

532
00:33:55,236 --> 00:33:57,154
It scares me, Betty.

533
00:33:57,738 --> 00:34:00,241
You scare me. Can't you see that?

534
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:04,161
You're scaring me, Betty.
You're scaring me.

535
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:15,881
I think I figured it out.

536
00:34:17,758 --> 00:34:20,302
You paralyzed Nana Rose
with the Tannis root

537
00:34:20,386 --> 00:34:22,221
and pushed her down the stairs.

538
00:34:25,015 --> 00:34:27,893
You've gone mad.
That's all there is to it.

539
00:34:28,853 --> 00:34:30,563
You have lost your mind and...

540
00:34:31,981 --> 00:34:33,607
And you leave us no choice.

541
00:34:36,068 --> 00:34:37,862
What do you mean, no choice?

542
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,446
But it's all right.

543
00:34:42,241 --> 00:34:44,034
We're gonna make you all better.

544
00:34:47,163 --> 00:34:47,997
All better.

545
00:34:49,915 --> 00:34:55,421
Every hour that passes that Jughead
is out there is bad for business.

546
00:34:56,589 --> 00:34:59,758
Time to remove Jughead
and his fellow Serpents by force.

547
00:34:59,842 --> 00:35:02,553
Grown-ups after teenagers?
Wouldn't that be bad?

548
00:35:02,636 --> 00:35:05,890
If Sheriff Keller and his men do it, yes.

549
00:35:07,391 --> 00:35:09,643
But boys, led bravely by you?

550
00:35:10,394 --> 00:35:13,564
The wrestling team.
No one would be too upset by that.

551
00:35:13,647 --> 00:35:14,481
I can't.

552
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,818
I'm sorry, I won't.

553
00:35:19,904 --> 00:35:22,907
Archie, you made a promise to me.

554
00:35:23,407 --> 00:35:25,993
An oath to this family in this very room.

555
00:35:29,246 --> 00:35:32,541
- You break it, there will be consequences.
- I understand.

556
00:35:33,375 --> 00:35:35,878
So... you'll help me?

557
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:39,548
Yes, sir.

558
00:35:44,637 --> 00:35:47,640
But I hope you can prove
your loyalty to me in return.

559
00:35:48,265 --> 00:35:50,142
And how would I do that?

560
00:35:50,226 --> 00:35:53,896
By releasing my dad
from all commitments to Lodge Industries.

561
00:35:58,692 --> 00:36:03,322
[chanting] Save our school.
Save our school. Save our school.

562
00:36:04,782 --> 00:36:06,325
Send a car by the station.

563
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:30,683
Cops may let you by, but you come in here,
and I'll knock you down.

564
00:36:30,766 --> 00:36:34,353
Dad, don't. They'll throw you in jail.
Don't give them an excuse.

565
00:36:35,813 --> 00:36:37,648
I'm sorry, Jughead.

566
00:36:39,817 --> 00:36:40,651
Me, too.

567
00:36:43,028 --> 00:36:44,947
I'm not gonna fight you, Archie.

568
00:36:47,408 --> 00:36:48,242
Look around.

569
00:36:49,994 --> 00:36:52,705
Now people know what Hiram's doing.

570
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:57,167
What's happening here.
This fight is not gonna go away.

571
00:36:57,251 --> 00:36:58,877
We're not going to go away.

572
00:37:00,713 --> 00:37:02,798
So, go on. Cut us down.

573
00:37:03,924 --> 00:37:05,634
I want them to see you do it.

574
00:37:57,711 --> 00:38:01,298
Do you think it made any difference?
Us freezing our asses off?

575
00:38:01,381 --> 00:38:02,424
Definitely.

576
00:38:03,967 --> 00:38:06,886
Every revolution starts somewhere.

577
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:07,804
Good.

578
00:38:09,139 --> 00:38:12,851
'Cause I've been thinking.
We lost Southside High.

579
00:38:13,685 --> 00:38:16,104
I don't want to lose Riverdale High, too.

580
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:22,611
And you've not heard more unlikely words
come from my mouth, but...

581
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,154
[sighs]

582
00:38:29,075 --> 00:38:31,411
I wanna run for student body president.

583
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:34,956
And I want you to be my co-president.

584
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:38,001
- I know that you and Veronica...
- Okay.

585
00:38:40,879 --> 00:38:43,840
- Really? Just like that?
- Just like that.

586
00:38:45,717 --> 00:38:46,885
I'm in, Jug.

587
00:38:48,136 --> 00:38:49,971
There is no me and Veronica.

588
00:38:52,807 --> 00:38:54,809
You have to do me a favor, though.

589
00:38:57,979 --> 00:38:59,648
You have to let me stay here.

590
00:39:01,775 --> 00:39:04,694
I can't stay in the same house
as Chic anymore.

591
00:39:08,448 --> 00:39:09,282
Okay.

592
00:39:17,707 --> 00:39:18,541
Okay.

593
00:39:19,376 --> 00:39:20,543
[Mary laughing]

594
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,422
- What's going on?
- Your pal Hiram Lodge called.

595
00:39:24,881 --> 00:39:27,384
He's letting your dad out of his contract.

596
00:39:27,467 --> 00:39:31,096
Well, I never doubted your mom
for a second. Knew she'd do it.

597
00:39:31,179 --> 00:39:32,013
Wow, that's...

598
00:39:33,223 --> 00:39:35,517
- That's great.
- Yeah, and another thing.

599
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:39,145
- We've been talking...
- I'll stick around for a while.

600
00:39:39,229 --> 00:39:42,357
Help your dad
with some more unfinished business.

601
00:39:42,649 --> 00:39:45,527
That contract was the last thing
holding him back.

602
00:39:46,945 --> 00:39:47,821
From what?

603
00:39:50,115 --> 00:39:51,741
I'm gonna run for mayor.

604
00:39:52,534 --> 00:39:54,994
Against the Lodges. Come what may.

605
00:39:58,665 --> 00:40:00,083
[doorbell rings]

606
00:40:03,878 --> 00:40:05,630
Mrs. Blossom, hi.

607
00:40:05,714 --> 00:40:09,384
I'm looking for Cheryl. She wasn't
at the hospital with her nana.

608
00:40:09,467 --> 00:40:12,345
No, she's gone.
Boarding school in Switzerland.

609
00:40:12,929 --> 00:40:15,140
All girls. She left just last night.

610
00:40:15,223 --> 00:40:18,768
[chuckles] Mrs. Blossom,
that doesn't make any sense.

611
00:40:19,102 --> 00:40:20,353
Don't come here again.

612
00:40:44,335 --> 00:40:45,628
[shivering]

613
00:40:53,303 --> 00:40:57,724
Oh, you poor child.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

614
00:40:59,809 --> 00:41:04,147
- Sister Woodhouse is going to help you.
- Thank you, Sister Woodhouse.

615
00:41:05,064 --> 00:41:08,818
Yes, she's going to rid you
of all those naughty demons.

616
00:41:10,862 --> 00:41:14,574
The ones making you think
such awful, unnatural thoughts.

617
00:41:17,744 --> 00:41:19,204
Today, you must rest.

618
00:41:21,372 --> 00:41:24,375
Tomorrow, the real work...

619
00:41:25,919 --> 00:41:27,796
the conversion begins.
