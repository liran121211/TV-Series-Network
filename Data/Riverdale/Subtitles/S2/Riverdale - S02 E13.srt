1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:03,083
Previously on Riverdale...

2
00:00:03,085 --> 00:00:04,399
Isn't it something
the Serpents would do?

3
00:00:04,401 --> 00:00:06,234
- Why'd you do it?
- To cause some chaos.

4
00:00:06,237 --> 00:00:09,093
So Hiram Lodge asked
you to start a mutiny.

5
00:00:09,096 --> 00:00:10,607
It's an eviction notice.

6
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,582
My woman's intuition
told me Sheriff Keller

7
00:00:12,585 --> 00:00:15,162
was having an affair with Mayor McCoy.

8
00:00:15,164 --> 00:00:16,997
I have some out-of-town
guests coming in.

9
00:00:16,999 --> 00:00:19,700
I'm hosting a little
poker game at Pop's.

10
00:00:19,702 --> 00:00:22,207
Poppa Poutine was found
dead in his hotel room

11
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,671
less than an hour ago, shot
in the back of the head.

12
00:00:24,673 --> 00:00:26,664
Good night, Chic. You'll be safe here.

13
00:00:26,667 --> 00:00:27,999
He has to go, Alice.

14
00:00:28,002 --> 00:00:30,220
I threw you out once, I'll do it again.

15
00:00:30,223 --> 00:00:32,089
I want all of you tonight.

16
00:00:32,623 --> 00:00:33,856
Is Chic home?

17
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,183
Mom...

18
00:00:39,445 --> 00:00:41,021
What... What happened?

19
00:00:41,023 --> 00:00:43,523
No, no, Don't come any closer.
Don't... Don't touch anything.

20
00:00:43,525 --> 00:00:46,994
He tried to hurt me and
Chic, your brother...

21
00:00:48,385 --> 00:00:50,197
- No, no, what are you doing?
- I'm calling the police!

22
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:51,965
No, don't do that. Do not do that!

23
00:00:51,967 --> 00:00:53,800
Mom, there's a man on our floor!

24
00:00:53,802 --> 00:00:55,869
If the police come, they're
gonna take Chic away from me

25
00:00:55,871 --> 00:00:57,571
and I won't let that happen again.

26
00:00:57,573 --> 00:00:59,640
Well, if it was self-defense...

27
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:02,903
- It was self-defense, right?
- Yes, of course, it was.

28
00:01:04,013 --> 00:01:06,113
- But it won't matter.
- What do we do?

29
00:01:06,115 --> 00:01:08,882
- Just go to your room. You didn't see anything.
- Mom, let me help you.

30
00:01:08,884 --> 00:01:10,884
No, honey. It's better
if you're not involved.

31
00:01:13,515 --> 00:01:15,155
- It's Dad.
- Don't answer it.

32
00:01:15,157 --> 00:01:17,524
- What if he came...
- Yes, you're right. Answer.

33
00:01:17,526 --> 00:01:19,960
Just... Just act like
everything is normal.

34
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,196
Hi, Dad, what's up?

35
00:01:25,467 --> 00:01:28,402
Oh. Okay, I'll see you in a bit.

36
00:01:28,405 --> 00:01:29,989
Please tell me he's not coming here.

37
00:01:29,992 --> 00:01:31,179
Uh, he needs toiletries.

38
00:01:31,182 --> 00:01:33,372
He says he doesn't wanna
get in a fight with you.

39
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:35,008
- Betty!
- Mom...

40
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,537
We don't know how much time we have.

41
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,140
Please just let me help you.

42
00:01:38,143 --> 00:01:40,213
And in one reckless moment...

43
00:01:40,215 --> 00:01:42,950
Bleach is under the sink.

44
00:01:44,386 --> 00:01:47,721
The lives of the Cooper
women were forever changed.

45
00:01:47,723 --> 00:01:50,590
They were a mother
wanting to protect her son,

46
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:53,427
and a daughter wanting
to protect her mother,

47
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:55,629
while less than 50 yards away...

48
00:01:55,631 --> 00:01:59,299
Once more, you didn't
see or hear Hiram Lodge

49
00:01:59,301 --> 00:02:03,064
say anything to or about Poppa Poutine?

50
00:02:03,067 --> 00:02:05,401
Honestly, it seemed like...

51
00:02:05,404 --> 00:02:07,174
- What?
- Like they were friends.

52
00:02:07,176 --> 00:02:10,010
A friend, Archie, doesn't
force you down to your knees

53
00:02:10,012 --> 00:02:13,114
and shoot you in the back
of the head with a Glock 34.

54
00:02:13,117 --> 00:02:16,183
Maybe it wasn't Mr. Lodge. I mean,
I didn't see him leave the Pembrooke.

55
00:02:16,185 --> 00:02:17,951
Hiram would've sent someone.

56
00:02:17,953 --> 00:02:19,895
- His capo.
- What's a capo?

57
00:02:25,494 --> 00:02:26,927
If you woke up my dad...

58
00:02:26,929 --> 00:02:30,663
A "capo," Archie, does the
boss's dirty work, the killing.

59
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:34,400
Is there someone who's
always hovering around Hiram?

60
00:02:34,403 --> 00:02:37,537
Like a personal assistant, a driver?

61
00:02:40,809 --> 00:02:42,676
Not that I can think of.

62
00:02:43,712 --> 00:02:46,279
Hello? Betty?

63
00:03:00,796 --> 00:03:02,295
Betty.

64
00:03:03,032 --> 00:03:04,097
Alice.

65
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:05,298
- Hal.
- Dad.

66
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,234
So, where's Chic?

67
00:03:07,236 --> 00:03:09,136
Upstairs in his room, resting.

68
00:03:11,573 --> 00:03:13,273
What... what's that smell?

69
00:03:13,275 --> 00:03:15,642
Bleach. I spilled tomato soup,
I didn't want it to stain.

70
00:03:15,644 --> 00:03:17,446
Well, it must have been a lot of soup,

71
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:19,726
because it smells like
a hospital in here.

72
00:03:19,729 --> 00:03:21,948
Dad, do you want me to
get the toiletries for you?

73
00:03:46,341 --> 00:03:47,474
Jug, what's up?

74
00:03:47,476 --> 00:03:50,043
Nothing, I was just
calling to say good night.

75
00:03:50,946 --> 00:03:52,479
And, uh...

76
00:03:53,315 --> 00:03:54,881
I love you.

77
00:03:54,884 --> 00:03:56,917
Your dad's gone. Hurry up!

78
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:59,486
Oh, Jug, uh, I gotta go.
I'll see you tomorrow.

79
00:04:04,126 --> 00:04:06,293
What if someone comes
looking for him, Mom?

80
00:04:06,295 --> 00:04:07,966
People go missing every day.

81
00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:09,830
But what if he has a family?

82
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,465
He didn't strike me as the type.

83
00:04:11,467 --> 00:04:13,433
I mean, who walks
around without a wallet?

84
00:04:23,345 --> 00:04:26,279
They shut down these
sewer pipes decades ago.

85
00:04:28,283 --> 00:04:30,884
This used to be my secret
place as a little girl.

86
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:34,234
Here, cover it up.

87
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,779
They were hiding something.

88
00:04:38,782 --> 00:04:41,828
Oh, Harold, everyone's
always hiding something.

89
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,231
The house smelled of bleach.

90
00:04:45,267 --> 00:04:47,154
And you didn't see Chic?

91
00:04:47,157 --> 00:04:49,113
Maybe he was up in his room.

92
00:04:50,038 --> 00:04:51,896
Entertaining.

93
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:54,441
Tall boy won't be
coming back anytime soon.

94
00:04:54,443 --> 00:04:55,709
Good.

95
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,310
He was a coward.

96
00:04:58,446 --> 00:05:01,314
You know, riding back, I was
thinking, maybe I should take a page

97
00:05:01,316 --> 00:05:03,850
from your book and have
a sit-down with McCoy.

98
00:05:03,852 --> 00:05:05,357
Now that we know that Hiram Lodge is

99
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,381
responsible for what
happened to the statue,

100
00:05:07,384 --> 00:05:10,557
I say we show her the head,
appeal to her sense of justice.

101
00:05:12,361 --> 00:05:14,027
What, you don't like that plan?

102
00:05:19,405 --> 00:05:20,638
Wait a second.

103
00:05:20,641 --> 00:05:23,603
Boy, where the hell is
General Pickens' head?

104
00:05:24,673 --> 00:05:27,756
I don't think we can interpret
the delivery of that head

105
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,576
as anything less than
a declaration of war.

106
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:33,521
Well, we knew we'd have
to go to war, eventually.

107
00:05:33,524 --> 00:05:36,355
There is, of course, another option.

108
00:05:37,653 --> 00:05:41,154
At Spence, I was Secretary
General of the Model UN,

109
00:05:41,156 --> 00:05:44,631
and before declaring war, we'd
always try to negotiate a settlement.

110
00:05:44,634 --> 00:05:47,294
Now, if I could broker a detente

111
00:05:47,296 --> 00:05:49,796
between the Contras and the Sandinistas,

112
00:05:49,798 --> 00:05:52,766
you should be able to de-escalate
relations with a biker gang.

113
00:05:52,768 --> 00:05:54,282
This isn't high school.

114
00:05:54,285 --> 00:05:57,524
Said the man who just
vandalized a park statue.

115
00:06:00,075 --> 00:06:02,042
You're an excellent businessman, Daddy.

116
00:06:02,044 --> 00:06:06,571
I'll get them to the table,
all you have to do is play nice.

117
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,290
We have work to do.

118
00:06:13,293 --> 00:06:14,947
We have to clean anything that he may

119
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,201
have touched, so there
are no fingerprints.

120
00:06:27,445 --> 00:06:28,923
Mom?

121
00:06:28,926 --> 00:06:31,238
Did he touch any of these?

122
00:06:31,241 --> 00:06:32,607
No.

123
00:07:21,361 --> 00:07:22,975
Mom?

124
00:07:22,978 --> 00:07:25,225
Oh, good, you're up! Have a seat.

125
00:07:26,528 --> 00:07:29,564
I don't like chocolate-chip pancakes.

126
00:07:29,567 --> 00:07:32,719
Well at least, have some
cereal. You must be starving.

127
00:07:36,104 --> 00:07:37,748
Thank you.

128
00:07:37,751 --> 00:07:39,700
Oh, can I have the butter, please?

129
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:01,995
Elizabeth?

130
00:08:12,841 --> 00:08:14,407
Ask who it is.

131
00:08:14,409 --> 00:08:15,742
Who is it?

132
00:08:26,054 --> 00:08:28,555
Morning.

133
00:08:29,825 --> 00:08:32,058
Just thought I could walk you to school.

134
00:08:36,173 --> 00:08:39,525
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

135
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:45,657
Hey, can I talk to you about last night?

136
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:49,294
Why? What about it?

137
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:52,363
Nothing, I just... thought
we had this really nice night,

138
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,600
and you hung up on me, so
I... I kind of got nervous.

139
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:58,538
Maybe you felt we were
moving too fast or...

140
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,738
I don't know, maybe it wasn't enjoyable?

141
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,896
Oh, my God! No!

142
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:05,973
No, not at all.

143
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:09,848
Last night was amazing.

144
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:13,751
There was just a lot of
drama when I got home.

145
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,455
Let me guess, Chic-centric?

146
00:09:19,577 --> 00:09:21,210
It'll be fine.

147
00:09:21,213 --> 00:09:24,562
Just typical Cooper house lunacy.

148
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,710
So Archiekins, do you regret anything

149
00:09:27,713 --> 00:09:30,538
we talked about at my confirmation?

150
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:34,539
The revelation that my father's
more Al Capone than Eliot Ness?

151
00:09:34,542 --> 00:09:37,642
No. All good on my end.

152
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:42,030
In that case, just to
put it on your radar,

153
00:09:42,033 --> 00:09:44,075
a low-key turf-war
might be brewing

154
00:09:44,078 --> 00:09:46,117
between the Joneses and the Lodges.

155
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,764
Veronica, are you trying
to manage me right now?

156
00:09:48,767 --> 00:09:51,522
- Define "manage."
- People are gonna lose their homes.

157
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:54,993
Jughead, why don't you come over with
your dad and sit down with my dad,

158
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:58,210
and hash this out like
civilized humans, face-to-face?

159
00:09:58,213 --> 00:10:00,732
Okay, one condition.

160
00:10:00,735 --> 00:10:03,368
Your dad comes to
Sunnyside Trailer Park.

161
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,737
I want him to see the people
that he's gonna be displacing.

162
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:10,108
Fine. And trust me, no
one is being displaced.

163
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,911
Oh, my God, did you guys hear?
My dad's scanner's blowing up.

164
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:14,593
The police found another dead body

165
00:10:14,596 --> 00:10:16,516
this morning, there's blood everywhere.

166
00:10:17,869 --> 00:10:20,151
Could the Black Hood
have risen from the grave?

167
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:22,220
- Did they say whose body?
- Where did they find it?

168
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:24,155
The investigation's
ongoing but apparently,

169
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:26,958
it was a gruesome, gangland-style
execution at the motel,

170
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,194
with blood and brains
splattered all over the duvet...

171
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:31,696
Okay, Kev, we get it.

172
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,499
I gotta go.

173
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:52,517
Oh. Betty, are you okay?

174
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,919
- Do you need some help?
- I'm fine, Cheryl.

175
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:57,322
- Let me grab you a towel.
- I said I'm fine!

176
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,426
You have puke on your collar.

177
00:11:09,088 --> 00:11:12,741
A bullet to the head? That
is clearly a mafioso's doing.

178
00:11:12,744 --> 00:11:15,655
God, no sooner do I feel
like I'm in a good place,

179
00:11:15,658 --> 00:11:18,810
some terrible thing
happens, somebody dies...

180
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:20,795
And I'm immediately
back in the place of,

181
00:11:20,798 --> 00:11:22,447
"What if my father's behind this?"

182
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:24,415
And making matters infinitely worse,

183
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,985
I've now dragged you into
this Martin Scorsese nightmare.

184
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:29,687
Veronica, I chose to be with
you, remember? To help you.

185
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,489
Archie, I can't handle the not knowing.

186
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:33,958
Then choose to believe in your dad.

187
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,878
His business dealings might be shady

188
00:11:35,881 --> 00:11:37,965
but at heart, he's still a good guy.

189
00:11:37,968 --> 00:11:41,099
- I know that. You know that.
- Do I?

190
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:46,304
Come here.

191
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:54,345
Riddle me this. What do
Sunnyside Trailer Park,

192
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:58,516
Twilight Drive-In and Southside
High, all have in common?

193
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:01,152
I'm sure I don't know.

194
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:05,254
They were or are
townland. You control them.

195
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:09,594
The drive-in was shut
down as was Southside High.

196
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:11,596
Now the trailer park is in jeopardy.

197
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:14,766
Can't you just feel the invisible
hand of Hiram Lodge all over this?

198
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:20,705
What exactly are you insinuating?

199
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:24,008
If you've been accepting
"donations" from the Lodges

200
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:27,621
in exchange for "favors"
such as land deals...

201
00:12:27,624 --> 00:12:31,282
Now is your chance to
come clean to the public.

202
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,589
- What is this, a bribe?
- Payment.

203
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:42,033
The FBI always
compensates its informants.

204
00:12:42,036 --> 00:12:43,835
Enclosed is three weeks' salary.

205
00:12:43,838 --> 00:12:45,226
Great.

206
00:12:45,229 --> 00:12:47,498
Now I can replace the
bass drum you trashed.

207
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,902
I'm hoping that payment will
entice you to go to Hiram Lodge

208
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:54,305
and engage with him
directly about Poppa Poutine.

209
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:57,991
Be a little aggressive, gauge
his reaction, see what he says.

210
00:12:57,994 --> 00:13:00,661
But if I ask him anything
about it, he'll be suspicious.

211
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:06,905
Come on, Archie.

212
00:13:06,908 --> 00:13:08,558
How many people have to get hurt or

213
00:13:08,561 --> 00:13:10,302
die before you do something about it?

214
00:13:11,793 --> 00:13:13,918
Thank you for meeting
with me, Mr. Lodge.

215
00:13:13,921 --> 00:13:15,111
Yeah, of course, Archie.

216
00:13:16,744 --> 00:13:20,430
The article in the Register about
Poppa Poutine in his hotel room...

217
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:22,100
Archie, if I may?

218
00:13:24,741 --> 00:13:28,072
I am gutted over this atrocity.

219
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:31,894
But Poutine was rich
with enemies. He was rude,

220
00:13:31,897 --> 00:13:36,714
and selfish, and deep
into gambling debts...

221
00:13:36,717 --> 00:13:39,984
A quarter to Lenny alone,
not to mention the affairs...

222
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:43,921
With so many vendettas against
him, it was just a matter of time.

223
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:47,390
And sadly, his time came the same
night as my daughter's confirmation.

224
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:50,094
But since you brought up
Veronica's confirmation,

225
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:51,886
she's the reason I came to see you.

226
00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:53,830
Has something happened?
Is she all right?

227
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,134
When she heard someone
was murdered in Riverdale,

228
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:59,035
the thought of you, maybe, possibly

229
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:01,472
being involved is making her spiral.

230
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:05,152
And I don't want to
overstep, but you may

231
00:14:05,155 --> 00:14:07,608
want to clarify things
with your daughter.

232
00:14:07,611 --> 00:14:09,778
Just to give her peace of mind.

233
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:20,051
Hey honey. Perfect timing,
we're about to have dinner.

234
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:22,186
Oh, no, I'm not hungry.
I have a ton of homework.

235
00:16:19,149 --> 00:16:20,748
Hey, Veronica.

236
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,083
Hi, Daddy.

237
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:24,686
Ready for your big negotiation?

238
00:16:24,688 --> 00:16:28,823
I am. But first, Archie
came by to see me.

239
00:16:29,526 --> 00:16:30,825
He said you were concerned.

240
00:16:31,761 --> 00:16:34,301
- Daddy...
- No, no. It's all right.

241
00:16:34,304 --> 00:16:37,298
I'm glad he did. He... cares about you.

242
00:16:39,002 --> 00:16:40,235
As do I.

243
00:16:42,172 --> 00:16:45,673
I understand certain aspects
of my business trouble you.

244
00:16:46,642 --> 00:16:49,209
So if there's something
you wanna know...

245
00:16:49,212 --> 00:16:51,946
Do you have anything to do
with Poppa Poutine's death?

246
00:16:55,335 --> 00:16:56,918
No, mija.

247
00:16:57,821 --> 00:16:59,420
I did not.

248
00:17:09,566 --> 00:17:13,268
You lied to us. That shady guy
wasn't one of your customers.

249
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:16,170
He was a drug dealer. It's all in here.

250
00:17:16,172 --> 00:17:18,973
Hundreds of messages from
junkies looking for a fix,

251
00:17:18,975 --> 00:17:21,319
including one from Chic, the night of...

252
00:17:21,322 --> 00:17:23,402
Betty, why in God's name
would you go back there?

253
00:17:23,405 --> 00:17:25,103
To make sure in broad daylight that

254
00:17:25,106 --> 00:17:26,848
no one could see him from the trail.

255
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:28,391
Okay, give that back
to me before someone

256
00:17:28,393 --> 00:17:29,784
tracks that right back to this house.

257
00:17:29,786 --> 00:17:31,519
No, Mom. I already turned off the GPS.

258
00:17:31,521 --> 00:17:33,621
And you're missing the
whole point here, okay?

259
00:17:33,623 --> 00:17:35,423
Chic lied to us about the shady guy.

260
00:17:35,425 --> 00:17:37,692
What else is he lying about, huh?

261
00:17:40,664 --> 00:17:43,151
Excuse me. Are you kidding me?

262
00:17:43,154 --> 00:17:45,700
No one is buying the waterworks.

263
00:17:45,702 --> 00:17:47,459
That's enough, Elizabeth.

264
00:17:47,462 --> 00:17:49,990
You keep this up, and you're
going to get us all caught.

265
00:17:49,993 --> 00:17:51,339
He's the one who's gonna get us caught

266
00:17:51,341 --> 00:17:53,274
by not telling us everything
that we need to know, Mom.

267
00:17:53,276 --> 00:17:56,268
What, that that person in the
sewer pipe was a drug-dealer?

268
00:17:56,271 --> 00:17:59,113
Frankly, I'm relieved.
A transient like that?

269
00:17:59,115 --> 00:18:00,964
Hopefully, it means no
one is looking for him.

270
00:18:00,967 --> 00:18:03,237
Um, I hate to break it to you, Mom,

271
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,123
but drug dealers still have families.

272
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:07,088
What's done is done, Elizabeth.

273
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:09,924
The only family that you should
be worried about is your own.

274
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:16,787
I asked him point-blank.

275
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:21,373
I said, "Mr. Lodge, did you kill or
hire anyone to kill Poppa Poutine?"

276
00:18:21,376 --> 00:18:24,092
- And he said no.
- And you believed him?

277
00:18:24,095 --> 00:18:27,130
I did, yeah. I do.

278
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:34,854
And Mr. Lodge did tell me
there was, uh, bad blood

279
00:18:34,857 --> 00:18:38,419
between Poppa Poutine and
some other guy named Lenny.

280
00:18:38,421 --> 00:18:39,921
Lenny Kowalski?

281
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:42,698
Yeah.

282
00:18:42,701 --> 00:18:45,350
I guess Poutine owed him a lot of money.

283
00:18:45,353 --> 00:18:48,570
$86,000 in gambling debt or something.

284
00:18:49,399 --> 00:18:51,165
Lenny Kowalski.

285
00:18:51,935 --> 00:18:53,368
Let me look into it.

286
00:18:56,873 --> 00:19:00,435
Thank you for agreeing to sit down
and discuss this misunderstanding.

287
00:19:00,438 --> 00:19:02,690
- There's no...
- There's no misunderstanding here.

288
00:19:02,693 --> 00:19:06,748
Tall Boy said you paid him to
decapitate the Pickens statue.

289
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,450
As an excuse to turn up
the heat on the Serpents.

290
00:19:09,452 --> 00:19:12,225
You got a lot of nervous people
scared they're gonna lose their home.

291
00:19:12,228 --> 00:19:13,834
I heard about that.

292
00:19:13,837 --> 00:19:15,548
And though it has nothing whatsoever to

293
00:19:15,551 --> 00:19:17,258
do with me, I've spoken to Mayor McCoy.

294
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:20,294
And as a gesture of goodwill
to the Southside community,

295
00:19:20,296 --> 00:19:24,499
I'd like to settle any back rent
you or your neighbors owe the town.

296
00:19:25,702 --> 00:19:29,170
- And what do you want in return?
- Peace in the land.

297
00:19:29,172 --> 00:19:30,471
Hmm.

298
00:19:35,845 --> 00:19:37,011
It's a deal.

299
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:41,111
There is one thing.

300
00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:42,708
Mayor McCoy tells me you have some kind

301
00:19:42,711 --> 00:19:44,222
of expose you're working on, Jughead.

302
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:46,005
So in exchange for
my generous offer, I'd

303
00:19:46,008 --> 00:19:48,362
appreciate it if you just
kept my name out of it.

304
00:19:48,365 --> 00:19:50,458
Sound fair?

305
00:19:52,595 --> 00:19:55,307
That sounds a lot like a bribe.

306
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,495
No deal.

307
00:19:57,498 --> 00:19:59,634
See you in the funny pages.

308
00:20:19,122 --> 00:20:21,289
Have you no scruples, Mother?

309
00:20:21,292 --> 00:20:23,157
What are you going on about now?

310
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:25,927
I just saw Hal Cooper
leaving Thistlehouse.

311
00:20:25,936 --> 00:20:29,771
Betty was literally sick to her
stomach at school yesterday, Mother.

312
00:20:30,388 --> 00:20:32,651
What if it was over this?

313
00:20:32,654 --> 00:20:36,204
You're destroying families
with your courtesan ways.

314
00:20:38,141 --> 00:20:40,374
It's different... with Hal.

315
00:20:41,344 --> 00:20:43,044
He's not a client.

316
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,693
It's real.

317
00:20:45,696 --> 00:20:48,916
Mother, he has a wife!

318
00:20:48,918 --> 00:20:52,675
Alice Cooper? That gorgon?

319
00:20:52,678 --> 00:20:54,689
She's not the victim here.

320
00:20:55,492 --> 00:20:58,059
So please, Cheryl, stay out of it.

321
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:11,639
Let me tell you two something.

322
00:21:11,641 --> 00:21:14,154
I am this close to telling
that Jones boy everything,

323
00:21:14,157 --> 00:21:16,444
and it'll be a lot worse for
you than it will be for me.

324
00:21:16,446 --> 00:21:18,012
Mayor McCoy!

325
00:21:18,781 --> 00:21:21,082
Wait, what just happened?

326
00:21:21,084 --> 00:21:24,285
Given the hatchet-job your friend
Jughead is writing about us,

327
00:21:24,288 --> 00:21:27,121
your mother and I feel it's
best to accelerate our timetable.

328
00:21:27,123 --> 00:21:30,925
So we told Sierra we might have to
announce our plans for Southside High,

329
00:21:30,927 --> 00:21:33,854
but typical Sierra,
she refused and demanded

330
00:21:33,857 --> 00:21:36,030
that we wait until
after she's reelected.

331
00:21:36,032 --> 00:21:39,267
And she's threatening to expose
us if we proceed without her.

332
00:21:39,269 --> 00:21:42,303
If this isn't handled properly, the
whole town will be out for our blood.

333
00:21:42,305 --> 00:21:45,273
If we get her out of the Mayor's
office, under a cloud of scandal,

334
00:21:45,275 --> 00:21:47,245
the damage she could do
to us would be minimized.

335
00:21:47,248 --> 00:21:50,278
- How? How would you do that?
- I had Andre follow her.

336
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,981
And let's just say, she spends an
awful lot of time in cheap motels.

337
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,854
It's time for Operation
Guess Who's Coming To Dinner.

338
00:22:04,761 --> 00:22:07,795
Hey, Vegas! Hey, boy.

339
00:22:07,797 --> 00:22:09,864
Hey, boy...

340
00:22:21,277 --> 00:22:22,710
Dad?

341
00:22:22,713 --> 00:22:25,026
Hey, Arch... Uh, this is...

342
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:27,815
Agent Adams. Nice to meet you.

343
00:22:27,817 --> 00:22:30,051
Your father and I
were just finishing up.

344
00:22:41,531 --> 00:22:42,959
Hello.

345
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:46,447
Hi, I found this phone in a parking
lot. I was wondering if you knew...

346
00:22:54,811 --> 00:22:57,578
- Hello?
- Hi, I'm so sorry to bother you.

347
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,447
I think someone lost this phone.

348
00:22:59,449 --> 00:23:01,359
I was wondering if you
knew who it belong...

349
00:23:11,761 --> 00:23:14,061
- Hello?
- Who the hell is this?

350
00:23:14,063 --> 00:23:15,930
Uh, I found this phone...

351
00:23:15,932 --> 00:23:17,131
Cut the crap!

352
00:23:17,134 --> 00:23:19,298
You're the slut he's been
whoring with, aren't you?

353
00:23:19,301 --> 00:23:20,901
- You're why he's been missing!
- Uh...

354
00:23:20,904 --> 00:23:24,092
You know what? Tell that
scumbag not to come home.

355
00:23:24,095 --> 00:23:25,312
He's dead to me!

356
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:41,856
Betty?

357
00:23:43,146 --> 00:23:44,425
Yeah, I'll be right there.

358
00:23:49,532 --> 00:23:50,765
Betty...

359
00:23:51,768 --> 00:23:54,035
What's going on? What
are you doing out here?

360
00:23:55,939 --> 00:23:58,089
I think I'm going crazy.

361
00:23:58,092 --> 00:24:01,909
Jug, my mom's acting like
everything's normal when...

362
00:24:03,146 --> 00:24:05,613
It's not. Everything is falling apart.

363
00:24:05,615 --> 00:24:07,748
Everything is falling apart.

364
00:24:12,422 --> 00:24:14,256
I need to tell you something.

365
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,940
I can't eat, I can't sleep.

366
00:24:21,943 --> 00:24:25,044
I'm just obsessing over this shady man,

367
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:27,781
his phone and his life.

368
00:24:27,783 --> 00:24:30,750
Meanwhile, my mom's acting
like it never even happened.

369
00:24:30,752 --> 00:24:32,750
God, why didn't I just call the police?

370
00:24:32,753 --> 00:24:35,755
You still can, Betty. And
you know, you probably should!

371
00:24:35,757 --> 00:24:37,854
And say what, Jug?

372
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:47,237
Hey! Either of you know
the owner of that car?

373
00:24:49,892 --> 00:24:52,126
It's been parked there since
the day before yesterday.

374
00:24:52,129 --> 00:24:53,439
Neighbor's complaining.

375
00:24:58,814 --> 00:25:00,780
Yeah, sorry, Officer, that's my car.

376
00:25:00,783 --> 00:25:02,472
I just can't find my keys.

377
00:25:02,475 --> 00:25:05,922
Street's being cleaned tomorrow
a.m. I'm going around the block.

378
00:25:05,925 --> 00:25:08,354
If it's still there in five
minutes, you're getting a ticket.

379
00:25:14,018 --> 00:25:16,291
How fast can you hot-wire a car?

380
00:25:22,736 --> 00:25:24,435
That agent left.

381
00:25:25,356 --> 00:25:26,456
What did he want?

382
00:25:26,459 --> 00:25:28,325
Apparently, the FBI is assisting

383
00:25:28,328 --> 00:25:32,555
in a crackdown on
undocumented labor from Canada.

384
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:35,915
They think that maybe over the
years I've hired some of these guys,

385
00:25:35,917 --> 00:25:37,684
paid them cash under the table.

386
00:25:37,686 --> 00:25:40,081
Yeah, couple of times,
I looked the other way.

387
00:25:40,084 --> 00:25:41,788
But they can't take you
down for that, can they?

388
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,757
Oh sure, they can. Son, it's the FBI.

389
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:47,360
They're requesting my files
for the last seven years.

390
00:25:52,167 --> 00:25:55,702
Agent Adams, you stay
the hell away from my dad!

391
00:25:55,704 --> 00:25:58,226
Scary, isn't it? How quickly I can make

392
00:25:58,229 --> 00:26:00,540
things difficult for
you and your father?

393
00:26:00,542 --> 00:26:03,170
You said he'd be protected.
You gave me a freaking contract!

394
00:26:03,173 --> 00:26:04,773
Aw, gee.

395
00:26:06,047 --> 00:26:10,823
Poutine did not owe Lenny
Kowalski anything close to $86,000.

396
00:26:10,826 --> 00:26:13,519
I believe you're feeding
me false information

397
00:26:13,522 --> 00:26:15,390
because you're protecting Hiram Lodge,

398
00:26:15,393 --> 00:26:17,659
which means you're compromised.

399
00:26:17,662 --> 00:26:21,461
Basically, the only thing you
can offer me now is access.

400
00:26:21,464 --> 00:26:25,064
So I need you to wake
up, stop dicking around,

401
00:26:25,066 --> 00:26:27,690
and plant a bug in Hiram's office.

402
00:26:27,693 --> 00:26:30,370
Then he'll slip up

403
00:26:30,372 --> 00:26:32,338
and say something incriminating,

404
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,011
and I'll record it and arrest him.

405
00:26:35,014 --> 00:26:37,614
Nice happy ending.

406
00:26:39,047 --> 00:26:41,047
You and your father will be safe.

407
00:26:53,871 --> 00:26:56,638
I don't believe you, that
you'll leave me and my dad alone.

408
00:26:56,641 --> 00:27:00,250
I think you'll do anything that
you can to destroy Hiram Lodge.

409
00:27:00,253 --> 00:27:02,335
Even if it means destroying us.

410
00:27:02,338 --> 00:27:04,386
You better make sure
it doesn't come to that.

411
00:27:14,582 --> 00:27:17,050
Back so soon, Mr. Cooper?

412
00:27:20,034 --> 00:27:24,590
Cheryl, what are you doing
sitting there in the dark?

413
00:27:24,592 --> 00:27:28,028
You do know my mother's
a harlot, don't you?

414
00:27:28,031 --> 00:27:30,042
A modern-day Moll Flanders?

415
00:27:32,434 --> 00:27:35,711
What you're doing could
destroy your family.

416
00:27:35,714 --> 00:27:38,324
That's why I'm not going to tell Betty.

417
00:27:38,327 --> 00:27:40,092
But I suggest you hurry home to your

418
00:27:40,095 --> 00:27:42,145
wife and daughter
before I change my mind.

419
00:27:44,984 --> 00:27:47,317
I came to warn you, Mayor McCoy.

420
00:27:48,483 --> 00:27:51,347
I know that whatever
questionable arrangement

421
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:53,720
you have with my parents is imploding,

422
00:27:53,722 --> 00:27:57,557
and that you're trying to
go after them in some way.

423
00:27:57,559 --> 00:28:01,853
But, Mayor McCoy, they're
planning to discredit you,

424
00:28:01,856 --> 00:28:05,732
to get you out of this
office and neutralize you.

425
00:28:05,734 --> 00:28:09,002
Whatever bomb they think they can
set off will only burn them, too.

426
00:28:12,073 --> 00:28:13,706
They know about the affair.

427
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:19,078
Your... relationship
with Sheriff Keller.

428
00:28:20,849 --> 00:28:24,917
But, Mayor McCoy, you
can get out of this.

429
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:29,122
Take control of the
narrative, inoculate yourself.

430
00:28:32,482 --> 00:28:34,049
How long do I have?

431
00:28:38,366 --> 00:28:41,034
Norman Bates made it look so easy.

432
00:29:29,137 --> 00:29:30,703
His phone, too.

433
00:29:31,986 --> 00:29:33,920
- Betty, his phone.
- Oh.

434
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:53,277
As mayor, I have seen us
through a triumphant Jubilee

435
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,382
and the terrors of
the Black Hood killer.

436
00:29:56,385 --> 00:30:00,344
But my friends, it has
taken a personal toll.

437
00:30:00,347 --> 00:30:03,014
I have decided to step down as Mayor,

438
00:30:03,016 --> 00:30:05,416
to spend more time with my family

439
00:30:05,418 --> 00:30:09,320
and to return to my own legal
career right here in Riverdale.

440
00:30:09,323 --> 00:30:11,622
- What's going on?
- Mayor McCoy's resigning.

441
00:30:11,624 --> 00:30:14,025
- I am very proud...
- We haven't even made our play yet.

442
00:30:14,028 --> 00:30:16,862
That's great. Now, you don't have to.

443
00:30:18,298 --> 00:30:21,352
If you did, it would be cruel.

444
00:30:21,355 --> 00:30:23,901
It has always been my intention

445
00:30:23,903 --> 00:30:27,572
to do what is best for
the people of Riverdale.

446
00:30:27,574 --> 00:30:29,307
I have to say, Veronica,

447
00:30:29,309 --> 00:30:32,805
for Mayor McCoy to resign
like that out of the blue...

448
00:30:32,808 --> 00:30:35,846
It's almost as if someone warned her.

449
00:30:40,853 --> 00:30:44,288
Did you tell Mayor McCoy we were
planning to expose her affair?

450
00:30:46,492 --> 00:30:47,725
No.

451
00:30:48,728 --> 00:30:50,227
I did not.

452
00:30:52,732 --> 00:30:53,965
Hmm.

453
00:31:01,246 --> 00:31:05,343
Oh, Hal. Alice and Betty
aren't here right now.

454
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,780
But I can come in though, right, Chic?

455
00:31:09,783 --> 00:31:12,153
I mean, this is still my house.

456
00:31:32,372 --> 00:31:33,838
- Hi.
- Betty.

457
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,540
I wasn't going to tell
you about something,

458
00:31:36,542 --> 00:31:39,957
but all night long I kept tossing
and turning in my canopy sleigh bed,

459
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,907
thinking, "I'd wanna know."

460
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:44,248
But I take no pleasure
in sharing this with you.

461
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:46,371
Uh, actually, Cheryl, I gotta go.

462
00:31:46,374 --> 00:31:48,040
Chic texted me, he's
at home with my dad.

463
00:31:48,043 --> 00:31:49,699
This is about your father.

464
00:31:51,758 --> 00:31:54,855
I'm onto you. Your little
game isn't gonna work with me.

465
00:31:54,858 --> 00:31:56,591
Where's my grandfather's watch, huh?

466
00:31:56,594 --> 00:31:58,095
- Dad!
- Is that in here?

467
00:31:58,097 --> 00:32:00,131
What are you doing? I
thought you moved out.

468
00:32:00,133 --> 00:32:02,121
I did, but I had a change of heart,

469
00:32:02,124 --> 00:32:05,269
and I was feeling like, maybe
it was time for me to move back

470
00:32:05,272 --> 00:32:07,805
and finally get some answers from him.

471
00:32:07,807 --> 00:32:10,541
But your brother can't seem
to even look me in the eye.

472
00:32:10,543 --> 00:32:12,285
That's because you're terrifying him.

473
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:15,112
- Oh. Oh, I'm terrifying him?
- Yeah.

474
00:32:15,114 --> 00:32:17,973
Come on, Betty. What the
hell is going on here, really?

475
00:32:17,976 --> 00:32:19,649
Why does it stink of bleach?

476
00:32:19,652 --> 00:32:21,558
And where is the dining-room rug?

477
00:32:21,561 --> 00:32:24,188
I don't know. I think she
sent it out to get cleaned.

478
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:26,257
Oh. And what about the
lamp that's usually there?

479
00:32:26,259 --> 00:32:27,658
Why are you interrogating us?

480
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:30,061
Because something is
going on in this house!

481
00:32:30,063 --> 00:32:33,355
This kid is doing what,
turning... Turning tricks?

482
00:32:33,358 --> 00:32:35,625
They're coming through the
house... Who knows what?

483
00:32:35,628 --> 00:32:37,728
They're stealing and
pawning up, right Chic?

484
00:32:37,731 --> 00:32:39,470
Speak up! What else have
your pals taken from us?

485
00:32:39,472 --> 00:32:42,740
- Dad! Get away from him or I will call Mom.
- Fine. Think I care?

486
00:32:42,742 --> 00:32:45,276
And I will tell her about
you and Penelope Blossom.

487
00:32:49,315 --> 00:32:52,016
Maybe the reason you feel
like we're hiding things

488
00:32:52,018 --> 00:32:54,218
and keeping secrets is because you are.

489
00:33:01,203 --> 00:33:03,604
You need to leave, Dad. Now.

490
00:33:17,477 --> 00:33:18,576
Thank you, Betty.

491
00:33:18,578 --> 00:33:21,212
I didn't do it for
you, I did it for Mom.

492
00:33:21,214 --> 00:33:23,080
What if he comes back?

493
00:33:24,447 --> 00:33:26,180
Or calls the police?

494
00:33:33,817 --> 00:33:35,450
Oh, God...

495
00:33:51,911 --> 00:33:54,211
I have to tell you something, Mr. Lodge.

496
00:33:56,364 --> 00:33:58,431
The FBI approached me.

497
00:33:59,574 --> 00:34:03,180
I guess to be a mole or an
informant to keep tabs on you.

498
00:34:03,183 --> 00:34:04,855
The FBI did?

499
00:34:04,858 --> 00:34:07,618
- A few weeks ago.
- A few weeks.

500
00:34:07,621 --> 00:34:10,361
- I didn't tell them anything.
- Well, what would you have told them?

501
00:34:10,363 --> 00:34:13,898
- They asked me to plant a bug in here.
- A bug?

502
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,466
I smashed it with a hammer.

503
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:17,498
Mr. Lodge, this agent
has been threatening

504
00:34:17,501 --> 00:34:19,103
my dad because I haven't given up

505
00:34:19,105 --> 00:34:21,772
any information, and I don't
think he's gonna stop until I do.

506
00:34:21,774 --> 00:34:23,845
So why are you telling me...

507
00:34:23,848 --> 00:34:26,329
- any of this?
- Because...

508
00:34:26,332 --> 00:34:29,580
I like you, Mr. Lodge,
and I love your daughter

509
00:34:29,582 --> 00:34:31,466
and I think Agent Adams is a lot more

510
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:33,352
dangerous than you are at this point.

511
00:34:35,254 --> 00:34:37,571
Is that his name? Adams?

512
00:34:37,574 --> 00:34:39,456
Arthur Adams, yes.

513
00:34:40,387 --> 00:34:43,720
And uh... I was hoping
maybe you could help my dad.

514
00:34:43,723 --> 00:34:45,963
Maybe help us out of this.

515
00:34:49,502 --> 00:34:51,368
Arthur Adams will be dealt with.

516
00:34:52,605 --> 00:34:54,769
- You're not going to...
- No!

517
00:34:54,772 --> 00:34:56,405
Archie, no one's going to...

518
00:34:58,711 --> 00:35:02,079
As you can imagine, it's not
my first tangling with the FBI.

519
00:35:03,382 --> 00:35:06,217
Hey, you did the right thing telling me.

520
00:35:06,219 --> 00:35:07,790
Now, just give me 24 hours, I'll make

521
00:35:07,793 --> 00:35:09,322
some calls and I'll get back to you.

522
00:35:15,761 --> 00:35:18,429
I really didn't tell
them anything, Mr. Lodge.

523
00:35:18,432 --> 00:35:20,129
About anything.

524
00:35:21,267 --> 00:35:22,766
And I believe you.

525
00:35:24,604 --> 00:35:27,137
Now go. Wait to hear from me.

526
00:35:30,543 --> 00:35:31,842
Oh, and Archie,

527
00:35:33,082 --> 00:35:35,746
you tell your father everything
is gonna be just fine.

528
00:35:44,824 --> 00:35:48,254
Dad was here. He was pissed off
and asking a lot of questions.

529
00:35:48,257 --> 00:35:49,490
Oh, my God.

530
00:35:49,493 --> 00:35:51,428
Yeah, but don't worry, he won't be back.

531
00:35:53,766 --> 00:35:56,400
Mom, we're in way over our heads here.

532
00:35:56,402 --> 00:35:59,970
The shady man's car was parked
outside our house for two days.

533
00:35:59,973 --> 00:36:02,512
- What?
- It's okay. Jughead and I took care of it.

534
00:36:02,515 --> 00:36:04,081
- You told Jughead?
- Yes.

535
00:36:04,084 --> 00:36:06,324
I keep thinking about that damn body

536
00:36:06,327 --> 00:36:08,316
and about who might come looking for it.

537
00:36:08,319 --> 00:36:10,027
And how many loose ends are out there

538
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:12,090
that we're not even thinking about.

539
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:14,649
We need help, Mom.

540
00:36:14,652 --> 00:36:17,012
We can't go to the police. I can't.

541
00:36:17,015 --> 00:36:19,015
I'm sorry. I just can't.

542
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:21,661
I'm not talking about the police.

543
00:36:24,196 --> 00:36:25,696
- FP, I...
- Save it, Alice.

544
00:36:25,699 --> 00:36:27,865
Jughead just told me, all of it.

545
00:36:30,058 --> 00:36:32,336
I'm not gonna let the three
of you make the same mistake

546
00:36:32,338 --> 00:36:34,338
I made with Jason Blossom. Come on.

547
00:37:24,334 --> 00:37:25,761
Andre?

548
00:37:25,764 --> 00:37:28,016
We're going for a drive.

549
00:37:28,019 --> 00:37:29,504
The boss wants to see you.

550
00:37:37,781 --> 00:37:39,681
Hey, you just missed the
turn to the Pembrooke.

551
00:37:41,473 --> 00:37:42,772
Andre?

552
00:37:42,775 --> 00:37:44,252
Where are we going?

553
00:37:45,225 --> 00:37:47,558
Boss requested somewhere more private.

554
00:37:48,525 --> 00:37:49,924
Scenic.

555
00:38:23,253 --> 00:38:24,746
It's done.

556
00:38:24,749 --> 00:38:27,484
Jeez... Dad, you reek.

557
00:38:27,487 --> 00:38:29,253
It's the sodium hydroxide.

558
00:38:29,256 --> 00:38:31,423
In a week, there'll be nothing left...

559
00:38:32,889 --> 00:38:34,322
Not even his teeth.

560
00:38:38,072 --> 00:38:40,372
Thank you, FP.

561
00:38:40,375 --> 00:38:42,961
I'm sorry for involving Betty,

562
00:38:42,971 --> 00:38:45,284
and that she pulled Jughead into this.

563
00:38:50,251 --> 00:38:52,017
We take care of our own.

564
00:38:55,223 --> 00:38:56,722
The circle ends here.

565
00:38:58,076 --> 00:38:59,652
No more loose ends.

566
00:39:40,902 --> 00:39:42,496
Are we almost there?

567
00:39:42,499 --> 00:39:44,103
Just about.

568
00:40:01,923 --> 00:40:03,622
Come on, let's go.

569
00:40:03,625 --> 00:40:05,157
Come on.

570
00:40:14,735 --> 00:40:16,168
Here he is, boss.

571
00:40:18,005 --> 00:40:19,471
Thank you, Andre.

572
00:40:21,609 --> 00:40:23,042
Give us a moment.

573
00:40:35,872 --> 00:40:37,081
Mrs. Lodge?

574
00:40:37,084 --> 00:40:39,985
Do you know what "omerta" is, Archie?

575
00:40:40,895 --> 00:40:42,528
It's our code of silence.

576
00:40:42,531 --> 00:40:44,730
It states there is no worse,

577
00:40:44,732 --> 00:40:47,455
no more cowardly crime than snitching.

578
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:49,596
Mrs. Lodge, I...

579
00:40:49,606 --> 00:40:52,511
would never, ever...

580
00:40:52,514 --> 00:40:55,224
do anything to betray
your family, I swear.

581
00:40:55,227 --> 00:40:57,693
And so you've proven to
me these last few weeks.

582
00:40:59,447 --> 00:41:02,414
Hiram and I, unbeknownst
to our daughter,

583
00:41:03,584 --> 00:41:06,819
enlisted one of our closest
associates to approach you,

584
00:41:06,821 --> 00:41:09,989
say he was an FBI agent
investigating Hiram.

585
00:41:10,791 --> 00:41:12,458
Agent Adams isn't real.

586
00:41:13,494 --> 00:41:15,594
He works for me.

587
00:41:15,596 --> 00:41:17,521
One of my capos.

588
00:41:17,529 --> 00:41:20,132
I asked him to apply a
lot of pressure to you.

589
00:41:21,002 --> 00:41:22,401
Threaten your father, even.

590
00:41:23,204 --> 00:41:25,932
- See if you would crack.
- Wait...

591
00:41:25,935 --> 00:41:28,694
This whole thing, this
was all some kind of test.

592
00:41:31,724 --> 00:41:33,924
Yes, it was.

593
00:41:37,118 --> 00:41:38,651
And you passed.

594
00:41:41,088 --> 00:41:43,122
Welcome to the family, Archie.

595
