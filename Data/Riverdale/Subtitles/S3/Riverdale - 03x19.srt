00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:09,634
[narrator] <i>Previously on</i> Riverdale:

2
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:11,052
Are you engaged to Edgar?

3
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:14,639
Edgar and I have a deep understanding
of one another.

4
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:16,349
-How'd it go?
-Great.
No one suspects anything.

5
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:20,103
-Little last-minute boost.
-[Mad Dog] He's juicing.

6
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:22,856
-Take it to level the playing field.
-I don't take that stuff.

7
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:25,483
Something's wrong.
Ronson's on some kind of crazy drug.

8
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:27,527
We need a doctor.

9
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,864
[Jughead] You moved to town
to take the drug trade from Hiram Lodge?

10
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:33,116
Someone's looking
to reopen the candy store.

11
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:35,160
He needs
to know exactly what you're doing.

12
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:36,745
No, he doesn't.

13
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:39,039
[FP] You hurt a lot of people, Kurtz.
What were you thinking?

14
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,415
The ultimate quest.

15
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,459
One final game

16
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,711
for you and your family.

17
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:46,796
Save the little princess.

18
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:49,382
What the hell did you do? What did you do?

19
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,094
-[Jughead] Jellybean?
-Jellybean!

20
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:55,930
[Jughead] Dad.

21
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,309
[FP] The hell is that?

22
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:04,647
"I invite you to play a round
of Gryphons and Gargoyles,

23
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,401
the outcome of which will determine
Princess Jellybean's fate."

24
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:10,111
Hey.

25
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,405
Why is the door wide open?

26
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,158
What's wrong?

27
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,077
Where's JB?
She was taken.

28
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:25,627
By the Gargoyle King,
and his loyal servant Kurtz.

29
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:32,509
We have to find that son of a bitch.

30
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:33,843
Find him?

31
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,179
He's outside in the back of my cruiser.

32
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:55,573
Ms. Ronson?
Yes?

33
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,495
We did everything we could.
I'm very sorry.

34
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:01,663
[Elio] How did this happen?

35
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,748
[Patel] We'll know more
after the autopsy comes back.

36
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,041
We need to see him.

37
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,210
Of course. The nurse will show you.

38
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,712
[girls sobbing]

39
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:13,133
-Dr. Patel.
-Yes.

40
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:18,388
Listen, there's something you should know.
Randy was juicing.

41
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,305
Excuse me?

42
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:20,974
You gave it to him.

43
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,268
I would never give
one of my fighters drugs.

44
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:26,020
What Randy chose to put into his body,
unbeknownst to me,

45
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,147
is not my responsibility.

46
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,815
Well, aren't you manager of the year?

47
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,775
-His blood is on your hands.
-[Elio] No.

48
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,778
No, his blood is all over Archie's hands,
literally.

49
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,488
Better lawyer up, Andrews.

50
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,158
You killed him in that ring,
and you know it.

51
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,371
[shouts]

52
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,291
Where the hell is my daughter?

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,834
Tell me,

54
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:50,211
or I will kill you right here, right now.

55
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,880
Where are you keeping her, Kurtz?

56
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,048
With an associate.

57
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:56,301
Being very well taken care of.

58
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,887
-[shouts]
-[Jughead] He's not gonna tell us.

59
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,557
Accept the invite to play.

60
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:07,395
Let's see if you can bring Jellybean home.

61
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:08,605
[chuckles]

62
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,441
He's crazy.
How can we believe anything he has to say?

63
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,693
I've played this game enough
to know that guys like Kurtz

64
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:16,529
are completely devoted
to the Gargoyle King and his rules.

65
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:20,450
If we play, and we win,
we can get Jellybean back.

66
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,202
I'm sure of it.

67
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,041
We'll agree to your terms.

68
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,542
We'll play.
Of course you will.

69
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:37,050
First, your avatars.

70
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,134
Mr. Jones,

71
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,594
you'll be Deadeye,

72
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:41,804
like in high school.

73
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:42,722
Jughead...

74
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,391
you'll remain the Hellcaster.

75
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:49,229
And Mrs. Jones, you'll be...

76
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,481
the Alchemist,

77
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:52,732
I think.
Deadeye,

78
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,321
you're up first.

79
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,129
[Fred] Son, from everything you've said,

80
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,048
it's clear that Randy died
from those drugs.

81
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,634
An autopsy will support that.
You're innocent.

82
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:20,843
But I'm not, Dad.

83
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:24,847
I knew.

84
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:27,600
I knew Randy was juicing.

85
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,895
I could've stopped the fight,
but I didn't wanna forfeit.

86
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:32,730
If I had...

87
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,528
I'm never stepping into that ring
ever again.

88
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:41,739
I can't.

89
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,328
[Veronica] <i>Thanks for meeting us.</i>

90
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:50,415
I understand
I missed quite the fight earlier.

91
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:54,419
That's not why we're here.
Betty has a favor she wants to ask you.

92
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:57,463
Mr. Lodge,

93
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:02,802
my dad is incarcerated two hours away,
in a windowless cell.

94
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,971
It's a horrible place.

95
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:07,849
And he heard about your facility,

96
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:10,768
and how some of the cells even have views
of Sweetwater River.

97
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,437
Yeah, the waterfront rooms.
They're quite peaceful.

98
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:16,316
He would like to be transferred to one.

99
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:20,903
And I thought, since you own the place,
maybe you could help.

100
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,488
Think of all the publicity.

101
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,748
I'll see what I can do.

102
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,418
[cell phone buzzing]

103
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,922
-Mad Dog?
-What'd you do with the drugs I gave you?

104
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:43,760
-They're in my locker at the gym. Why?
-Archie, you need to get rid of them. Now.

105
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,346
Police showed up at Elio's gym.
Had a warrant. Did a full sweep.

106
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,931
They didn't find anything,
but what if they hit up El Royale?

107
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:52,101
-I'm on my way.
-I'll meet you there.

108
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,105
Come on, man. Hurry up.

109
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:57,899
I got it.

110
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:02,945
Hands up. Both of you.

111
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,364
[sirens wailing]

112
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:05,698
[man] Go ahead and check them.

113
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,742
He's got nothing to do with this.

114
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,421
You've reached your first challenge.

115
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:22,673
This one's easy.

116
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,635
It's called Cards on the Table.

117
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:31,307
Inside two of these pouches
is a white marble.

118
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,142
Inside the third is a black one.

119
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,521
If you choose the black one,
you must reveal your secret.

120
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,981
-Simple enough.
-Call it what you want.

121
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,734
We've been playing Secrets and Sins
since high school.

122
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:43,444
Alchemist.

123
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,280
Why don't you begin?

124
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:00,586
Hmm.

125
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,088
Be honest.

126
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,007
The King already knows
your darkest truths.

127
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:10,304
-I don't have any secrets.
-Mom.

128
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,390
Jellybean's life is on the line.

129
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,851
If you don't say something, I will.

130
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,019
What's he talking about?

131
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,400
I'm the new Fizzle Rocks dealer
in Riverdale.

132
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:26,195
And Kurtz used to work for me,
before he lost his damn mind.

133
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:27,613
What?

134
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,536
And you knew about this?
You didn't tell me, boy?

135
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,746
Don't blame him.
I told him not to say anything.

136
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,916
I wanted to keep you out of it,
to protect you, to protect the family.

137
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,127
How's that working for Jellybean?

138
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,295
Huh?

139
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:45,882
You're the reason
that this psycho kidnapped our daughter.

140
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,468
-You brought this into our lives!
-Dad.

141
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:50,052
I've heard enough.

142
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,179
I've heard enough.

143
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,806
We need to finish this damn game,

144
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:56,601
and get Jellybean back home,
safe and sound.

145
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,936
But there will be a reckoning.

146
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,237
Hey, Dad.

147
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,447
It's Josie.

148
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:16,120
Um... I saw you have a gig
at Tuba-dour in Seaside.

149
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:20,958
Uh, would you maybe
wanna grab some dinner beforehand?

150
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,754
Call me back, and let me know.

151
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:30,218
Well, everyone's gearing up
for the big wedding.

152
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,387
You know, between your mom and Edgar.

153
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,473
Yeah, I'm-- I'm aware.

154
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,266
There's also something else
you should know.

155
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,768
After the big wedding,

156
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,354
Edgar is planning
to adopt Juniper and Dagwood.

157
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:44,941
[sighs]

158
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,987
I posted your bail as soon as I could.

159
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,073
Thanks, Ronnie.

160
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:56,661
-We'll pay you back.
-That's the least of our worries.

161
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,412
Elio's been a busy bee.

162
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:02,166
[Elio] <i>Randy Ronson's autopsy</i>
<i>has revealed the ugly truth.</i>

163
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:03,876
<i>And what truth is that?</i>

164
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,337
<i>That he was, indeed,</i>
<i>taking performance-enhancing drugs,</i>

165
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,548
<i>provided by his competitor,</i>
<i>Archie Andrews.</i>

166
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,800
[Alice] <i>Alice Smith repor--</i>

167
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:13,844
This is nuts.
Elio's the one who gave Randy the drugs.

168
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,930
That may be impossible to prove.

169
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,182
He's setting me up
to take the fall, Ronnie.

170
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,644
-Am I screwed?
-With me in your corner?

171
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:23,437
Never.

172
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,357
I'm going to dog-walk that lying cad.

173
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:30,027
But we do need to play defense.

174
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,028
How do we do that?

175
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,405
First things first?

176
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,783
Drink up, boys.

177
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,789
[toilet flushing]

178
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,086
Man, this is humiliating.

179
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,547
Well, I guess you've never been on parole.

180
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,011
I am pleased to announce
that the results of the drug tests taken

181
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:59,432
by Archie Andrews and Mad Dog Moore
have both come back negative.

182
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,225
And as the investigation

183
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:04,395
into the horrific death
of Randy Ronson continues--

184
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:06,147
He murdered our brother.

185
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,860
Ms. Ronson, I assure you, Archie didn't.

186
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,570
You should fry for what you did.

187
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,992
Ms. Ronson,
believe me, if I could take back what--

188
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,493
Oh, did you get that?

189
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:22,496
I'm so sorry.

190
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,333
I wish it were me and not him.

191
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,544
I think you're not alone
in that sentiment, Andrews.

192
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:39,722
[Doris] Evelyn.

193
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,475
Have you already received
your meningitis vaccination?

194
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,603
No, the Farm doesn't believe

195
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:48,147
in putting foreign substances
into our bodies.

196
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:49,440
Check my file.

197
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,734
My father wrote Mr. Weatherbee a letter,
opting me out

198
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,195
-of all elective medical procedures.
-[sighs]

199
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,286
"Check my file."
I think I just might.

200
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,499
[thunder crashing]

201
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,749
"Transferred from St. Joe's Prep."

202
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:05,683
Finally, you've reached your next quest.

203
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,351
[thunder crashing and rumbling]

204
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:10,229
"Steal some treasure from the realm."

205
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,564
What treasure?

206
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:16,152
-He wants us to commit a robbery.
-You gotta be kidding.

207
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,237
-I'm the sheriff.
-Mm-mm. Not tonight.

208
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,072
Tonight you are the Deadeye.

209
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,490
And your target...

210
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:23,993
the tavern.

211
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:32,042
If everything is a parallel for Riverdale,
then the tavern is Pop's?

212
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:35,212
Consider it Jellybean's ransom.

213
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:40,259
And the money you obtain
is gonna get me out of town.

214
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,594
You're not going anywhere.

215
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,013
Only way this ends
is with you in the ground.

216
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:47,349
If I die, so does Jellybean.

217
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,731
But if I leave with the money,

218
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:55,733
then she lives.

219
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:57,777
And we all win.

220
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,288
[knocking on door]

221
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,294
Archie, did you run here?

222
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,754
It's pouring outside.

223
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:19,006
[Archie] I can't stop thinking
about Randy.

224
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,716
And Randy's sister
and what she said to me,

225
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,634
that I'm a murderer.

226
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:24,053
Archie, this is not your fault.

227
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,598
-This is on Elio, not you.
-I still feel responsible, Veronica.

228
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,391
I just-- I wish...

229
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,852
I knew how to help them.

230
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:33,979
Maybe...

231
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:36,816
El Royale can host a charity boxing event.

232
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,527
-We can raise money for their family.
-No. No boxing.

233
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,694
Okay, fine.

234
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:43,989
Um, we can host a benefit concert
at La Bonne Nuit.

235
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,659
Josie has been calling me
about doing a set,

236
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:49,245
so, let me talk to her,
and the Ronsons, okay?

237
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,413
Okay.

238
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:52,957
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

239
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,044
Hi. Is this the Gilroy Academy?

240
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,465
I'm Doris Bell from the principal's office
at Riverdale High.

241
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:04,260
We have a recent transfer
who attended your school

242
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,971
a couple years back, Evelyn Evernever?

243
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:10,724
I'm just checking our records.
What grade was she in?

244
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:13,936
A junior?

245
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,939
Yes, that's what I thought.
Thank you so much.

246
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,276
Five for five.

247
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:28,075
Ms. Weiss,
do you remember Edgar Evernever?

248
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:28,993
From the Farm?

249
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,037
I can't find out anything about his past,

250
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,915
but I did find something
about his daughter, Evelyn.

251
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,044
She's been repeating her junior year,

252
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,463
enrolling in different high schools,

253
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,633
pretending to be 17 for over a decade.

254
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:46,510
Oh, my God.

255
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,428
Yeah.

256
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,680
I think, from what I've found,

257
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:51,265
Edgar works on the parents,

258
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:54,977
while Evelyn is sent to high school,
to recruit teens into the Farm.

259
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,979
It's a cover for their cult.

260
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,981
I just need concrete proof.

261
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,942
I'm happy to make some inquiries.
I'll see what I can find out.

262
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,028
Thank you, Ms. Weiss.

263
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,907
I can't believe we're doing this.

264
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,659
We're in and out in 30 seconds.
Let me do the talking.

265
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:14,997
Kind of reminds me of the old days, huh?

266
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:18,250
-You guys have done this before?
-We're not getting into this.

267
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,670
[gun clicking]

268
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,797
Thanks again for coming, Dad.

269
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:27,384
It's nice to catch up.
My next tour is gonna be a long one.

270
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,347
Well, that's actually why
I wanted to meet up.

271
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,936
Recently, I've been the headlining act
downstairs at La Bonne Nuit.

272
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,730
But Riverdale is a small town,

273
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,067
and I wanna broaden my musical horizons.

274
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,526
So, I thought...

275
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:48,197
maybe I could go on tour...

276
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,115
with you.

277
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:54,078
Josie, it's a hard life,
being on the road.

278
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:58,207
Please, just come and see me perform.

279
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,833
I've got a set tonight.

280
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,504
[FP] Everybody on the ground, right now!

281
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,255
Get down.

282
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,507
[Jughead] Get down!

283
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:18,978
No.

284
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:21,563
Pop. Pop. Don't.

285
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,273
This isn't what you think.

286
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,025
-Go, go. Go.
-[Gladys] Hurry.
We gotta go. We gotta go.

287
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,154
-[FP] Go. Get out of here. Now.
-Damn it. We gotta go.

288
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,782
Go. Save Jellybean!

289
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:36,161
Now do you see why I need
to get the hell out of this town?

290
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,039
Oh, my God.

291
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,086
And then there were two.

292
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:50,759
Cops are probably on their way over here.
We gotta move him somewhere.

293
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,720
Yeah. Oh, I got a place.

294
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,472
[Betty] <i>I have good news, Dad.</i>

295
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,517
Your transfer papers have been processed.

296
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,270
Mr. Lodge says you could be moved
by the end of the week.

297
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,230
Thank you, Betty.

298
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:05,399
Yeah.

299
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,865
But something's bothering you.

300
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:14,658
What is it?

301
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:22,041
Edgar Evernever decided he wants
to adopt the twins after he marries Mom.

302
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,459
No, that can't happen.

303
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,837
Juniper and Dagwood must be protected.

304
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,755
I agree.

305
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:30,007
That's why I'm talking to a social worker.

306
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,968
Well, there's someone else
who might help you.

307
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:37,890
Someone uniquely motivated to help you.

308
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,685
[Betty] Auntie, I need your help.

309
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:46,398
Edgar Evernever
and the Farm have nefarious intentions.

310
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:47,900
I can feel it.

311
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:51,904
He plans to adopt your grandchildren,
and raise them as his own.

312
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:53,989
Polly, my mom, even Cheryl,

313
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,324
they made their decision.

314
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,535
But the twins are innocent. Helpless.

315
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,706
Auntie, you know what it's like

316
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:06,168
to be adopted into a family
that only wants to control you.

317
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,133
Dagwood.

318
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,260
-Where's Juniper?
-She's staying.

319
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,930
We get the boy, but Edgar keeps the girl.

320
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,890
Those were the only terms
that they would accept,

321
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,559
despite my threats
to come after the Farm in court.

322
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,394
They're twins.

323
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,438
You can't separate them.

324
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,023
And Edgar isn't even their father.

325
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,650
But Polly is their mother.

326
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,151
-It was her decision.
-No, Auntie.

327
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:36,240
Betty, it's a miracle
I could negotiate the release of one twin,

328
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:37,699
Jason Junior.

329
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,244
Don't feel bad. This is a win.

330
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,286
But, I--

331
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,001
[Elio] Slow day?

332
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,633
-The hell are you doing here, Elio?
-We have some unfinished business.

333
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,972
Fifty-thousand dollars,
courtesy of the Gilded Gloves.

334
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:03,809
Despite what happened to poor Randy,
you did win. It's yours.

335
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,812
I don't want your blood money.

336
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,816
Don't be a fool, Archie.
You went 12 rounds in your first fight.
You're a winner.
I could take you all the way to Vegas.

337
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,280
I'd call you the Riverdale Reaper.

338
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,991
People would pay a lot
to see you in the ring.

339
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,659
After all, you're a killer now.

340
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,788
Three against one. Bad odds, even for you.

341
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:25,956
Get the hell out of my gym.

342
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,958
Consider my offer, Reaper.

343
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,468
Kurtz is an insidious bastard.

344
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:43,515
I mean, even if we save Jellybean,
we still lose.

345
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:49,104
I just robbed Pop's at gunpoint.
It was unloaded, but still...

346
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,400
How can we stay in Riverdale after that?

347
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:55,944
We don't.

348
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,070
[sighs]

349
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:59,823
We get in the car, and we drive up north.

350
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:03,535
And we keep going until we find a town
where nobody knows us.

351
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,080
You just don't get it, do you?

352
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,626
Riverdale's our home.

353
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,085
Dad and I live here.

354
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:13,253
We're happy here.

355
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:16,840
It's you.

356
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,427
You destroyed that.

On top of everything else,

359
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:32,147
Elio is denying them
Randy's insurance money.

360
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,399
They've got nothing.

361
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:35,692
Well, he can't do that.

362
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,738
Well, I was hoping we could make
your show tonight a benefit, Josie,

363
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:41,406
with the proceeds going to the Ronsons.
Absolutely, Veronica. Whatever you need.

364
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:45,285
I'll do my best to make it back
in time for your set.

365
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,829
-[Josie] Back from what?
-Settling up with Elio.

366
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,464
What the hell?

367
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:59,174
Sleepy time's over, Kurtz.

368
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,218
What's the next challenge?

369
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:10,018
It's a doozy.

370
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:12,980
A trial with the Cyclops.

371
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:15,607
Cyclops?

372
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:19,278
That's not a character class
that I've ever read about.

373
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,991
I might know what he's talking about.

374
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,880
[Veronica] I'm sorry, Josie.

375
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:42,592
I double-checked at the door,
but your dad didn't pick up his ticket.

376
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:46,471
Why am I not surprised?

377
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:51,059
-Are you sure you're still up for this?
-Yeah. [chuckles] I'm fine.

378
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:53,812
And the show must go on, right?

379
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:57,733
Okay. Break a leg, girl.

380
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,497
[Archie] Where are you going at this hour?

381
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,167
The Reaper himself.

382
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,378
Finally come to your senses
and reconsidered my offer?

383
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,088
No.

384
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,758
But I will be taking that prize money,
after all.

385
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,344
[chuckles] I thought it was blood money.

386
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,721
You made a promise to the Ronson family.

387
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,182
That money is theirs.

388
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:33,769
So, give me that check,
and I'll let you leave here in one piece.

389
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,729
Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.

390
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:42,361
Still wanna call me the Reaper?

391
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,244
You should be paying the Ronsons
ten times this.

392
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,711
This was once the Gargoyle lair.

-Dead?

Is that what Mommy told you?

400
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:28,031
No, it was an eye for an eye.

401

Though I'm sure she wishes now
that she had finished the job.
