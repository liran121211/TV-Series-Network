00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:09,592
[narrator] Previously on Riverdale:

2
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:12,554
[Betty] Your mom can't start dealing drugs
without a lab to make them in.

3
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:14,180
Your mother and I are separating.

4
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:15,348
You always say,

5
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:18,184
"family is the most important thing."

6
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,728
There is no family anymore.

7
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:21,938
Today the Serpents start a new chapter.

8
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,691
You're no longer outlaws,
you're law keepers.

9
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:27,652
Are you Kurtz? You're all wanted
for making and dealing Fizzle Rocks.

10
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,279
Only the worthy will ascend.

11
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:32,240
Mr. Lodge gave me a list
of places his dealers used to go to

12
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:33,450
where G&G players congregate.

13
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,285
I have someone who can help you.

14
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,828
A friend of mine in the Farm.

15
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:41,124
[Betty] Groups like the Farm prey
on emotionally vulnerable people.

16
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:43,418
You're actually buying this Farm crap

17
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:46,588
that some huckster
named Edgar Evernever is selling you?

18
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:48,548
You don't just meet Edgar.

19
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:52,719
I knew my dad would like it.

20
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,019
[Jughead over radio]
Perimeter's clear. Moving in.

21
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:05,482
Go, go.

22
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,922
-Sweet Pea, duck.
-[Keller] Bang, bang. You're both dead.

23
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:31,716
-Always check your six, deputies.
-That's a deadly mistake.

24
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,385
[Keller] This is a simulation.
You don't get do-overs on the street.

25
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,639
Which makes it more obvious
that you boys aren't ready for them.

26
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:40,975
You wanna stop the rogue Gargoyles?
Work as a team.

27
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:43,853
Until you've proven you can do that,
I'm not letting you out there.

28
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:44,771
Do it again.

29
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:49,025
[FP] Let's go, Jug.

30
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:55,031
Is there any way that you can see
this divorce as a good thing?

31
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,910
I'm trying to find a lining
of even tarnished silver, but...

32
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:01,871
my parents raised me to believe

33
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,582
that family is the most important thing
in the world.

34
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,209
I'm so sorry, Vee.

35
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:07,961
[doorbell jingles]

36
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:13,424
Veronica, hi.
Do you mind if I hang some fliers?

37
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,176
The Farm is having an open house tomorrow.

38
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,302
An open house?

39
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,513
Yes. We are opening our doors to visitors.

40
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:21,141
Everyone is welcome
to tour our renovated premises,

41
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:24,644
meet with Farm elders,
and learn about our values and practices.

42
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,187
Go ahead, Evelyn.

43
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:27,647
Thank you.

44
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,111
Of course, I'll go with you.

45
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:35,780
It's good.

46
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:37,657
Hey, hon.

47
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,617
Why the long face?

48
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,622
One of my deputies found our old trailer,
or what was left of it.

49
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,207
It was burned to a crisp.

50
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:50,336
They found, uh,
drug cooking material inside.

51
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,213
Oh, my.

52
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,716
In our trailer?

53
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:57,051
Our little town can't seem
to catch a break.

54
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,679
You remove one cancer,
another one takes its place.

55
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,765
Come on, Dad.

56
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,602
We're missing
the Saturday morning cartoons.

57
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:07,687
Right.

58
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,485
Did you really think

59
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:18,948
that blowing up that decrepit trailer
would change anything?

60
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,283
Oh, I'm not gonna stop,

61
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:24,412
until you are out of Riverdale.

62
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:27,749
Well, you better buckle up, then,
'cause I ain't going anywhere.

63
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,130
And here's a tip.

64
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,008
Don't cross me again.

65
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,809
If you cross over this way,

66
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,103
you'll find two
of our more artistic members,

67
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:50,313
expressing themselves.

68
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,899
-Hi, Megan. Hi, Garrett.
-Hi.

69
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:56,319
At the Farm, we like to nurture
everyone's unique talents.

70
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,864
It's like Hockney meets Heaven's Gate.

71
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,701
Now, would anyone like to guess
what this room is used for?

72
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:04,911
Ritualistic drownings.

73
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,996
Sorry, Betty, I didn't hear you.

74
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,039
What's behind there?

75
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,208
That is just the janitor's closet.

76
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,503
Now, if everyone will follow me,
I'll show you the garden.

77
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,424
-Betty.
-Mom.

78
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,011
Go ahead, Vee.
I'll catch up with you in a bit.

79
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:27,725
-I didn't think you would come.
-Well, everyone's welcome, so...

80
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:30,478
[sighs]

81
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,272
Well, enjoy the rest of your tour.

82
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,024
Yeah, but wait.

83
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:36,693
That's it?

84
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:40,321
We haven't talked in forever,
and that's all I get?

85
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,906
"Enjoy the rest of your tour"?

86
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:46,035
You forsook me, Betty,
not the other way around.

87
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,663
So, if you'll excuse me.

88
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,584
Hi.

89
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,965
Would you be interested
in one of our quick and easy interviews?

90
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,968
Uh... Yeah. Sounds great.

91
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,803
If you'll follow me, then.

92
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:08,558
[Evelyn] Betty.

93
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,811
These interviews are
for people interested in joining the Farm.

94
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,229
Well, let's say that I am.

95
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,525
-Where's your dad, by the way?
-He's around.

96
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,155
Well, let's get started, shall we?

97
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:24,198
Name?

98
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,409
Betty Cooper.

99
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,370
Occupation?

100
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:30,830
Student.

101
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,752
Do you ever bite your fingernails?

102
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:36,836
Sometimes.

103
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:39,589
Do you ever feel stressed?

104
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:40,506
Sure.

105
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,759
Doesn't everyone? [chuckles]

106
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,891
Do you consider yourself a cold person?

107
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:52,518
No.

108
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:57,106
Okay.

109
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:58,775
Great. Thank you.

110
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,779
Is that it?
Aren't you gonna ask me about my secrets?

111
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,573
No. That's all we need for now.
Thanks. We'll call you.

112
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:13,373
No, I should be there,
if only for appearances.

113
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:15,833
[speaking in Spanish]

114
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:16,918
Damn it, Hiram.

115
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,546
Mom?

116
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,633
Your father is finally opening
that damn prison of his.

117
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:27,345
There'll be a ribbon-cutting ceremony
with Governor Dooley in attendance,

118
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:31,474
and he has very selfishly decided
that I, the mayor, am not invited.

119
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,852
Well, you did try to kill him.

120
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,145
Twice.

121
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:39,357
It's just a photo op, Mom. Don't spiral.

122
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,274
No.

123
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:42,443
Veronica, you don't understand.

124
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:46,239
It's just a matter of time before
our enemies find out about the divorce.

125
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:48,324
Without Hiram's protection,

126
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,326
my life could be in danger.

127
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,828
Why would they go after you?

128
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:53,955
I've made moves.

129
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,832
There are people with grudges.

130
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,250
In our line of work,

131
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,419
when a marriage unravels,

132
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,839
the wife of a mafia boss often simply...

133
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,049
just disappears.

134
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:12,723
One good thing about being your neighbor
is I get two kitchens to raid for grub.

135
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,184
Yeah. No worries, Jug.

136
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:18,396
-How's it going with your mom?
-It's a cold war.

137
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,566
I mean, the nuclear option
is that I tell my dad everything,

138
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:24,110
but that could spell
mutually assured destruction.

139
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,696
Instead, the Serpents
and I are just dismantling her drug trade,

140
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:27,780
piece by piece.

141
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,491
Up next, we're gonna drive the Gargoyles
out of town,

142
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,702
and her cook, Kurtz.

143
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:37,707
I am going to make Riverdale
a very unwelcome place for Gladys Jones.

144
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:40,460
If she does go, what happens to Jellybean?

145
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,378
Still need to figure that out.

146
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:44,380
[phone rings]

147
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:49,510
Hello?

148
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,179
[woman] Would you accept a collect call

149
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,848
from the Leopold and Loeb
Juvenile Detention Center?

150
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:55,725
Uh, sure.

151
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,729
-[Mad Dog] Archie, it's Mad Dog.
-Mad Dog?

152
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,648
-Dude, what's up?
-I need your help.

153
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:07,278
The drug trade has reared its ugly head
in Riverdale yet again.

154
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,864
My dad doesn't think we're ready,

155
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:12,241
but we're gonna be
Riverdale's unofficial DEA.

156
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,494
We'll make life miserable
for the Gargoyles,

157
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:15,953
and run them out of town.

158
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,998
But first, we're gonna hit the hot spots.

159
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:22,293
Make sure Gladys isn't using
any of Hiram's old infrastructure.

160
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:25,087
-[security gate buzzes]
-[Archie] Mad Dog, what's happening?

161
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,131
They're finally shutting down L&L.

162
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,342
Great. Because of what happened
to Warden Norton?

163
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:32,470
It's 'cause they're opening
that new prison on the Southside.

164
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:33,971
Hiram Lodge's private prison.

165
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,975
-But that's not for juveniles.
-Apparently a wing of it is.

166
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,852
We're all being transferred there, Red.

167
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,104
And the L&L guards
who made us fight here...

168
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,482
they'll all work there.

169
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,359
They're gonna start the fight club again.

170
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:49,111
My parole hearing was canceled,
out of the blue.

171
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,905
Baby Teeth, Thumper, theirs, too.

172
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:54,617
They're doing whatever it takes
to fill Lodge's cells come opening day.

173
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,954
I tried to call my family...

174
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,248
but no one's answering.

175
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:01,874
Mad Dog, listen to me.

176
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,877
You risked your life to help me escape.

177
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:09,632
Believe me when I say you will not
step one foot in Hiram Lodge's prison.

178
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,849
Nice digs, Archie.

179
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:21,644
So, my dad just gave you this gym?

180
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,646
Well, it's a long story.

181
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:29,735
Ronnie, Mad Dog and the other guys
can't be transferred to your dad's prison.

182
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,989
Those guards are sadists.
You worked so hard to get me out of there.

183
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:36,075
-I broke you out, remember?
-Yeah, but before that.

184
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,868
Your work with the Innocence Project,

185
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,203
petitioning the governor.

186
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:43,499
As a matter of fact, I happen to know
that Governor Dooley is in town.

187
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,253
Perhaps an appeal in person
might do the trick.

188
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:51,591
Hope the traffic wasn't too bad,
Governor Dooley.

189
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:52,508
Right this way.

190
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,139
What is this?

191
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,267
I thought I was sitting down
with your father.

192
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,811
No. That was a pretense
to lure you in here.

193
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,896
This is my ex-boyfriend, Archie Andrews.

194
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:08,816
Governor, I need to speak to you
about the transfer of inmates

195
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,235
from Leopold and Loeb
Juvenile Detention Center

196
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,945
to Hiram Lodge's private prison.

197
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,489
You can't let it happen.

198
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,992
I don't know who you people are,
but I'm not staying for this.

199
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,327
Walk, and I take my story

200
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,163
to every 24-hour news channel
and paper in the tristate.

201
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,248
What story?

202
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:28,586
While my friends and I were forced to box
for L&L's illegal fight club,

203
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:33,090
you and Warden Norton were at fundraisers,
having lobster dinners.

204
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,635
And there are five other inmates
who will swear

205
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:40,514
that you attended these illegal fights
with Warden Norton as his personal guest.

206
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,099
They'll testify in court.

207
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:46,020
And what exactly do you expect me to do?

208
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,356
You're the governor, aren't you?

209
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,484
Pardon them. Today.

210
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,327
Thank you for agreeing to help me, Cheryl.

211
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,371
I haven't agreed to anything yet.

212
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,748
Infiltrating the Farm.

213
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,000
Isn't this a mission for you
and your beanie-headed beau?

214
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:11,045
I've already tried,
but Evelyn doesn't trust me.

215
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:14,590
She was, however, definitely trying
to woo you during the musical.

216
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,092
What's your obsession with the Farm?

217
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,969
They wear white after Labor Day,
but beyond that, are they that horrible?

218
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,596
They're a cult, Cheryl.

219
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,349
It's not just my friends
and family they've targeted.

220
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,559
Juniper and Dagwood,
your niece and nephew,

221
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,603
are being raised as toddler Farmies.

222
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,439
And looked perfectly happy and healthy,
last time I saw them.

223
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,440
[sighs]

224
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:33,818
What about Jason?

225
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,822
He told Polly they were running away
to the Farm.

226
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,074
Don't you wanna know why?

227
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:42,159
Please, Cheryl, believe me.

228
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,453
If I could go undercover, I would.

229
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:48,791
[Cheryl crying]

230
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:51,627
Hello?

231
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,048
Is everything okay?

232
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,603
Oh, Cheryl.

233
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,648
What is it? Is there anything I can do?

234
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:13,816
It's over.

235
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,570
Toni and I broke up again.

236
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,156
For good this time.

237
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,616
I don't know what to do.

238
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:26,620
It might help you
to talk about it with a friend.

239
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:32,543
I'm in, cousin.

240
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:34,587
[sighs]

241
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,673
[rock music playing on speakers]

242
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,347
Hey, man. Can I help you?

243
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:49,059
Yeah, do you, uh, think I could get
a little... game enhancement?

244
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:56,317
That's a limited edition.

245
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:58,694
Fifty bucks.

246
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:03,657
Everything good?

247
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,326
Not for you.

248
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,954
Hey there.

249
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:09,872
Remember me?

250
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,625
Last time I was here with the Red Paladin.

251
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,752
And that day, I was in a good mood.

252
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:18,172
But today, I'm in a bad mood.

253
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:21,801
You can help me with that by telling me
where all these drugs are coming from.

254
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,512
-The Gargoyles are dealing again.
-Where are they selling from?

255
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:27,139
-We've been to all the hot spots.
-No, it's old-school.

256
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:30,267
Street corners.
You can tell by the gargoyles on wires.

257
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,230
What the hell does that mean?

258
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,857
In some cities, when you see
a pair of sneakers on telephone wires,

259
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,442
it means that there's drug den nearby.

260
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:41,195
-But he's saying...
-Look for gargoyles instead of shoes.

261
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,655
Okay. Search this place.

262
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,615
Confiscate any contraband,

263
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,200
or drugs, or gaming equipment.

264
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,743
Don't make me come back here.

265
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:52,164
How exactly did you obtain
all this detective gear, Betty Snooper?

266
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:56,460
My mom had a box of this stuff from
when she worked at The Riverdale Register.

267
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:57,586
Done.

268
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,841
Now all you have to do is just go in there
and be yourself.

269
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,676
Keep the conversation going.

270
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,178
Answer all of their questions honestly.

271
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,096
Okay?

272
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,059
What's your favorite color?

273
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:15,855
Red, obvi, but if I had to specify,
I'd say Pantone's Flame Scarlet.

274
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,567
Do you bite your fingernails or cuticles
when you're stressed?

275
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,069
Heh. No. My manicurist would kill me.

276
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:24,655
[Evelyn] Dad.

277
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:25,698
-Hi.
-[gasps]

278
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,074
Oh, my God.

279
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,451
This is Cheryl Blossom.

280
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:33,956
It's nice to meet you, Cheryl.

281
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,250
Thank you, honey.

282
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,046
My dad will be finishing your interview.
You're in good hands.

283
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,840
Shall we jump back in?

284
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,720
Have you ever experienced
the loss of a loved one?

285
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:48,637
Yeah.

286
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:49,972
My brother, Jason.

287
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:53,183
And when he passed,
did you find yourself able to grieve?

288
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,394
Honestly,
there's so much I don't remember.

289
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,814
I was in a dark place.

290
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,232
Elucidate that for me.

291
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:02,234
Jason was my twin.

292
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,655
And when I lost him,
I lost a piece of myself.

293
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,866
I wanted so desperately
to reunite with him

294
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:12,286
that I found myself on the frozen bed
of Sweetwater River.

295
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,622
When I fell through the ice...

296
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:17,666
I saw him down there.

297
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,377
Afterwards, I was changed.

298
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,381
It was like my spirit had finally returned
to my body.

299
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,176
So much so
that I burned down my childhood home.

300
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,721
So, you've already been baptized.

301
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,807
And been reborn in fire.

302
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,268
I... I suppose.

303
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:39,521
But yet the memory
of your brother still hurts, doesn't it?

304
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,025
Cheryl.

305
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,029
Memories are often painful.

306
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,491
But they don't have to be.

307
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:55,996
They can be a path to revival.

308
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:01,085
I believe the Farm can help you see that.

309
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,630
[Mad Dog] Gotta give you props, Red.

310
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,632
One minute we're headed to Hiram's prison,

311
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:09,301
and the next,
we're walking out of L&L, time served.

312
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,637
Now you're out, what's next?

313
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,055
What's the plan?

314
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,891
I'm gonna go find my family.

315
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,854
-Some of these guys got no place to go.
-I got no one, so...

316
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,359
Don't worry, Baby Teeth.

317
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,237
Think I got a place.

318
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,032
Sweet.

319
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:38,080
It's not fancy, but it's a hell
of a lot better than a cell in L&L.

320
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:42,793
Set some cots up around the place.
You guys can stay as long as you want.

321
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,754
This is yours? You own a gym?

322
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,006
It's a long story.

323
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:50,843
Guys, this is Mr. Keller,
trainer extraordinaire.

324
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,136
[chuckles]

325
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,430
Mr. Keller, these are the guys
I was talking to you about.

326
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,431
Good to meet you.

327
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,892
Glad to see that Archie's gonna finally
have some competition around here.

328
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,231
Mad Dog, what do you say?

329
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,108
You jonesing for a rematch?

330
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,569
As long as there's
no guards betting on us.

331
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,199
[Jughead] All right, what's your 20?

332
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:18,370
[Sweet Pea] We broomed out the Gargoyles
at the intersection of Baker and Main.

333
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,123
Good work, Sweet Pea.
Move to the next corner.

334
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,003
[Fangs] Lovers' lane is all clear.
Gargoyles took off quick.

335
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:26,962
Copy that, Fangs.

336
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:30,424
-[Weasel] Took care of 6th and Benedict.
-Great job. Keep it up.

337
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,176
What you got for me?

338
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:33,719
First and Maple.

339
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:34,636
Nice work.

340
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,056
Got it. Well done, Jinx.

341
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,018
[Sweet Pea] One more corner to go,
if you wanna get in on the action.

342
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,478
I'll meet you there, Sweet Pea.

Whoa, hold up.
We're just here for the Gargoyle.

349
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,034
You screwed up, kid.

350
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,744
Damn it.

351
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:02,664
You ruined my bust.
What the hell were you thinking, boy?

352
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,212
What were you thinking?
Are you out of your mind?

353
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,547
He was gonna lead me to the cook,
to Kurtz.

354
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:13,926
-You asked me to be your eyes and ears.
-I told you to report back to me.

355
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:18,055
What the hell is going on here?
We can hear you all the way in JB's room.

356
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:21,141
Your son thought that he could cure
Riverdale's drug problem

357
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,143
by cracking a few skulls, didn't you?

358
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,105
I had it under control.

359
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,815
Jughead, maybe your father is right.

360
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:30,400
If it's as dangerous as he says it is,

361
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:33,153
maybe this whole deputy program

362
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,114
isn't such a good idea for the Serpents.

363
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,031
Your mother's right.

364
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,658
No, don't listen to her.

365
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:43,413
If I see or hear about any other Serpents

366
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,457
trying to take the law
into their own hands again,

367
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,585
I swear, I'll throw your asses in jail.

368
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:56,176
Looks like you'll be
sitting the next few rounds out, sugar.

369
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,353
-Keller trained you up good, huh, Red?
-Yeah, a little.

370
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,021
[clapping]

371
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,900
What are you doing here, Elio?

372
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,528
I heard this old gym had reopened,
thought I'd drop by.

373
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,363
Quite the stable of fighters you got.

374
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,699
If I'm not mistaken,
I've seen a few of these faces before.

375
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:22,327
-Who's this clown?
-He's a crook. No one you need to know.

376
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,329
I'm a boxing manager,
looking for new talent.

377
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:28,000
You boys wanna start earning cash money,
come see me at Casa Grande Gym.

378
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,419
Elio, no one here is looking
for your business.

379
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,837
Okay? So, take a hike.

380
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,173
Leave, or I'll throw your ass out myself.

381
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,014
[Veronica] Mom, Dad.

382
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,224
I have an idea.

383
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,517
If you're open to it,

384
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,312
I think you should consider
seeing a marriage counselor.

385
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,564
-Heh. Veronica--
-You want us in therapy?

386
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:53,066
You wouldn't be the first mobster
to see a therapist, Daddy.

387
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,860
There's nothing for us to discuss.

388
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,363
Maybe I should call the monsignor
to remind you

389
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,866
that marriage is ordained by God,

390
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,118
-and therefore, non-negotiable.
-[chuckles]

391
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:04,745
Mom, what do you think?

392
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,705
-You have the most to lose.
-Veronica.

393
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,083
I'm not gonna beg for forgiveness
or mercy from your father.

394
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,668
He's clearly given up.

395
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:13,754
Well, I haven't.

396
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:17,883
I'm still fighting for this family,
after everything.

397
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:18,800
After...

398
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,762
How many times did you try to kill Archie?

399
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,348
-Water under the bridge.
-[scoffs]

400
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:27,851
Really?
You trying to murder my boyfriend...

401
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,062
is water under the bridge?

402
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:35,984
You raised me to believe

403
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:39,655
that family was the most important thing
in the whole world,

404
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:43,075
and I stupidly believed it,
and it cost me Archie.

405
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,536
When he came back,
and you were in the hospital,

406
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,789
I chose you over Archie.

407
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:51,208
I broke up with him,
because you were on death's door.

408
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,877
And I thought,
"We need to come together, all of us.

409
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,754
We need to rally around Daddy,

410
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:59,049
and give him strength,
so that he doesn't die."

411
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,259
And now...

412
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,678
you have the gall...

413
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,639
to break apart our family?

414
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,017
You made your point.

415
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,688
But this ship has sailed, mija.

416
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,024
So, grow up, and accept it.

417
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,195
[Betty] What's he like?

418
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,488
Younger than I thought.

419
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:24,283
Also, count him among the hot dads
of Riverdale,

420
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:27,244
because Mr. Evernever is a yummy snack.

421
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:29,579
He's also a great listener.

422
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,707
Cheryl, this is huge.

423
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,916
You're in with Edgar,

424
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,128
which means I have a few questions
I need you to ask him, okay?

425
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,547
Why did Edgar decide to come
to Riverdale now?

426
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,174
And how many members does he plan
on recruiting?

427
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,218
-Most importantly--
-Excuse you.

428
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,470
We are having a private conversation.

429
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,638
Can you leave?

430
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,183
Go on, cousin.

431
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,227
You said Edgar recorded your interview.

432
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,646
I need to find out
where he stores those tapes.

433
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,398
If I can get my hands
on my mom and Polly's,

434
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,109
then the Farm won't
have any leverage over my family.

435
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:00,027
I'll try my best.

436
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:04,740
TBH, I kind of enjoyed talking to Eddie.

437
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:09,369
I swear, if I never eat anything
other than these burgers again,

438
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,704
I'll die a happy man.

439
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:15,042
Hey, Mad Dog. You all right?

440
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,961
I found my grandma and little brother.

441
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,631
They moved into some apartment building
that's falling apart.

442
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:24,509
It's been taken over by drug dealers
in weird masks.

443
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:27,554
-What, like gargoyle masks?
-Yeah.

444
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:30,515
They're cooking drugs
out of some vacant apartments,

445
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,225
and my grandma
and brother are right there.

446
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:33,268
We'll get them out.

447
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:36,855
-We gonna move my family into the gym?
-No, not your family.

448
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,732
I'm talking about the Gargoyles.

449
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:41,526
We're gonna get rid of the Gargoyles.

450
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,130
[Hermione] It was right there on my desk.

451
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,299
I got the message, loud and clear.

452
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,635
They want me dead.

453
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:08,637
Who?

454
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:10,680
Someone looking for payback.

455
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,226
One of our enemies, maybe the St. Clairs.

456
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:16,103
Or your father.

457
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,522
Oh, my God, Mom.

458
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,864
I drove past the building.
Jug, Mad Dog was right.

459
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:30,283
I saw Gargoyles coming in and out,
like they owned the place.

460
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,035
-How many?
-A lot.

461
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,870
It must be
where Kurtz is doing his cooking.

462
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:37,624
-Well, should we go to your dad?
-No, that's the nuclear option, remember?

463
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:39,543
My dad doesn't even want us on the street.

464
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:42,295
I'll see if the guys are willing
to risk their necks

465
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,881
against the Gargoyles,
and my dad, for that matter.

466
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,633
Well, count us in, too.

467
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:50,178
Me, Mad Dog, and the crew.
They can fight. Every last one of them.

468
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,263
More the merrier.

469
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,768
[Cheryl] Before we begin, Mr. Evernever,

470
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,061
may I ask you a question?

471
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:01,022
These tapes you're making,
what are they for?

472
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:04,151
Many of our members
like to refer back to them,

473
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:05,986
from time to time, track their growth.

474
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,239
And where do you store these tapes?

475
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,159
In a secure location.

476
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,577
[Cheryl] On the premises?

477
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:22,085
Why are you so concerned
about the tapes, Cheryl?

478
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:26,089
Oh, no. No concern.

479
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:27,924
Just...

480
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,634
curious.

481
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:30,594
Curious?

482
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:35,765
Before we get back to the interview,
I'd like to show you something first.

483
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:38,685
Something I think you will find very...

484
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:41,396
illuminating.

485
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,692
-If you'll follow me?
-I'd be honored.

486
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:47,277
[Betty] Cheryl.

487
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:48,612
No, no, no.

488
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:50,780
[Edgar] It's just down this hall.

489
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,742
You asked about our files.
They're right here.

490
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,785
[Cheryl]
But that looks like a broom closet.

491
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:59,122
[Edgar] Tomorrow night we're having
a get-together for new members.

492
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,082
Will you join us?

493
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,628
[Cheryl] Sounds unmissable.
Will all the Farmies be there?

494
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,880
[Edgar] Ah. Here we are.

495
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,007
After you.

496
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:11,676
[Cheryl] Uh, wait.

497
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,303
What happens in here?

498
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:14,638
[radio static]

499
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,109
[Betty] Cheryl.

500
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,820
I called you a dozen times.
I was beyond worried.

501
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,864
Why? I texted you I was fine.

502
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,242
Well, what was in
that room Edgar took you to?

503
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,118
None of your business.

504
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,454
Also, I'm done being your mole.

505
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,957
It's disrespectful,
not to mention illegal.

506
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,335
Okay, I was gonna say the same thing.

507
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:47,629
Stop going to the Farm
before Edgar catches on to you.

508
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:51,007
Oh, I'm still going to go.
I'm just done working for you.

509
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:52,300
Cheryl--

510
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,301
Toodles.

511
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:00,809
[door opens]

512
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,603
Did you send dead fish to Mom?

513
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,023
What on earth are you going on about now?

514
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,317
Mom's back at the Pembrooke, hysterical,

515
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,945
because someone wants her
sleeping with the fishes.

516
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:12,988
[chuckles]

517
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,700
I can't believe we're still having
this conversation, but here we go again.

518
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,620
I had nothing to do with whatever happened
to your mother.

519
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:23,623
Well, then it was one of your associates,
or enemies.

520
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:25,959
Are you sure it wasn't just a prank?

521
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,836
It was a lot more than a prank.

522
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:31,172
It was a not-so-veiled threat to her life.

523
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,383
Daddy, you have to protect her.

524
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:38,888
-What would you like me to do?
-Don't get a divorce.

525
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:39,931
[chuckles]

526
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,516
Okay, barring that,

527
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:44,978
don't shun her in public,
so the world sees that she's alone,

528
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,773
left twisting in the wind
by her all-powerful husband.

529
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:55,822
[Betty] I think I can get to the tapes
Edgar has on my mom and Polly.

530
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,783
On a scale of one to ten...

531
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:03,038
how dangerous is you sneaking
into the Farm gonna be?

532
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:06,249
Well,
they're still having the open house, so...

533
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:11,755
not as dangerous as you and Archie
raiding a building full of Gargoyles.

534
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:14,132
[chuckles]
This is the best pillow talk ever.

535
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:23,141
Today not only marks the opening
of the Lodge Detention Center,

536
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:26,227
it also represents a milestone
for our town.

537
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:30,398
This building is our promise to you
for a safer future.

538
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,860
Today we put our beloved families first.

539
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:37,280
And on that note, I wouldn't be here today

540
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:40,325
if not for the love and support
of my daughter, Veronica,

541
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:44,329
and that of my wife, Hermione,
the love of my life,

542
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,748
or as most of you call her, Madam Mayor.

543
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:47,957
[crowd applauding]

544
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,132
All right, listen up.

545
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,050
This is it.

546
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,095
Thanks to Mad Dog's recon,

547
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:02,514
we have a decent idea
of the layout of the building.

548
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:04,474
But we still need to be vigilant in there.

549
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:32,061
[door opens, closes]

550
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,409
[grunting and shouting]

551
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:19,984
You good, Jug?

552
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,111
Yeah. Thanks.

553
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:23,571
-Good job.
-[thud nearby]

554
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,909
I'll take care of them.
Go find that scumbag cook.

555
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:52,517
You gotta be kidding me.

556
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:24,465
Grab his hands.

557
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:31,806
Let's go.

558
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:37,645
You go.

559
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:38,980
I got Kurtz.

560
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,159
Hey, Jughead.

561
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,746
I'm ready to ascend.

562
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:56,748
Are you?

563
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:58,958
[shouting]

564
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:10,219
Jug?

565
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:11,846
Don't let Kurtz get away.

566
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:29,697
-Always good to see you, Hiram.
-Ah, thank you, monsignor.

567
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:30,907
Monsignor Montgomery.

568
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:41,584
-What was the monsignor doing here?
-Delivering the news in person.

569
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:47,924
-That our marriage has been annulled.
-What?

570
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:51,636
You should be happy.
It's much less public than a divorce.

571
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:54,764
And so as far
as our community is concerned,

572
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,392
your mother remains under my protection.

573
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,686
But in the eyes of God and the Church...

574
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:02,855
it's as if our marriage never existed.

575
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,274
That's not what I wanted.

576
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:06,359
Clearly not.

577
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,028
You did send your mother those dead fish.

578
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,446
What are you talking about?

579
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,657
It took me a while to figure this one out.

580
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,535
It was one of your more creative tactics.

581
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,704
Threaten your mother's life...

582
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:20,039
so that I had to protect her.

583
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:23,251
That is what happened, isn't it?

584
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:31,718
I thought if I could get you two together
in public...

585
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,262
you'd have to pretend.

586
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:36,889
And...

587
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,059
if you pretended long enough...

588
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:45,189
you'd start to feel the real thing again.

589
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:48,317
But it's over...

590
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:50,153
isn't it?

591
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,321
No matter what I do?

592
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:55,074
It's over.

593
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:56,868
Yeah.

594
00:33:58,786 --> 00:33:59,787
It's over, mija.

595
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:18,222
[sobs]

596
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:22,852
You've got guns now?

597
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:27,273
I led my Serpents into a buzz saw.
It's a miracle none of us were killed.

598
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:32,070
You wouldn't be dodging stray bullets
if you kept your nose out of my business.

599
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,322
I told you to stay out of it.

600
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:37,700
I think it's time that you, Dad,
and I have a big talk,

601
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,660
put all the cards on the table.

602
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,038
I don't care if his heart breaks.

603
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,998
He needs to know exactly
what you're doing.

604
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,416
No, he doesn't.

605
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,544
He and Jellybean aren't a part of this.

606
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:52,340
This is between you and me, kiddo.

607
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:53,841
Mano a mano.

608
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:54,842
[chuckles]

609
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,306
You caught us by surprise tonight.

610
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:02,683
That won't happen again.

611
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,352
Slowly but surely,

612
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,938
I'm going to choke your whole operation
to death.

613
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:30,211
[Edgar] Brothers and sisters,
good evening.

614
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:36,926
It warms my heart to see so many new faces
with us here tonight.

615
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,263
Including our newest initiate...

616
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,473
Cheryl Blossom.

617
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:46,435
-Welcome to our community, Cheryl.
-Damn it, Cheryl. Why?

618
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,646
[Cheryl] May the one become many.

619
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:50,148
[Farmies] And the many, one.

620
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:52,817
It's an alpha-numeric system.

621
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,485
[Edgar] Brothers and sisters,

622
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:57,238
you've all come here tonight
under great scrutiny

623
00:35:57,321 --> 00:36:00,533
and judgment from your friends,
and neighbors.

624
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,536
And possibly even your own family.

625
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:08,791
But only through great sacrifice
will your lives be full.

626
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:09,750
Cooper.

627
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,377
-The greater the sacrifice,
-Cooper.

628
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,879
the greater the bounty.

629
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:18,801
Plant your seed, brothers and sisters.

630
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:20,428
Plant it in the earth...

631
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,388
Two down, one to go.

632
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,390
...and watch it grow.

633
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,310
Spread it to others.

634
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:35,818
Hey, Mad Dog.

635
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:38,654
Any sign of Baby Teeth?
No one's seen him since the raid.

636
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,657
Not yet.
Some of the guys are out looking for him.

637
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:44,702
-How's your family?
-Oh, they're good.

638
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:48,080
They'll be better when I get them
out of that building.

639
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,999
-Where to? You got a place?
-I do.

640
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,878
Elio hooked me up
with a house on the Northside.

641
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,172
Elio did?

642
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:01,552
-So, what, you have to fight for him?
-Come on, man, you saw that place.

643
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:05,097
That's not where I want my grandma living,
my little brother growing up.

644
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:08,267
I hear that, Mad Dog,
but you can't trust Elio.

645
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:12,605
Of all the options before me,
his is the best.

646
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,984
I wouldn't even be here
if it wasn't for you, Red.

647
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,363
I'll never forget that.

648
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:42,426
What's this?

649
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:45,763
The tapes of your recorded session
with Edgar.

650
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:48,599
They have nothing on you now.
You don't have to go back.

651
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,101
But, Betty, I want to.

652
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:51,352
I'm going to.

653
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:54,188
Why? You don't listen to anyone, Cheryl.

654
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,523
Why Edgar Evernever?

655
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,984
It's not about Edgar, Betty. It's about...

656
00:37:59,026 --> 00:37:59,860
Jason.

657
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:03,990
They let me see him.

658
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,828
Edgar took me to a room...

659
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:13,541
closed the door, and inside...

660
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:16,168
there was Jason.

661
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:18,587
My dearest brother.

662
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,298
Um, I don't understand.

663
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:23,217
You heard his voice, like a séance?

664
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,135
No.

665
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:26,262
It was Jason.

666
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:29,265
I know it sounds crazy, but I saw him,

667
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,976
talked to him in the flesh.

668
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:37,398
I thought I would never see him again,
but the Farm gave me back my brother.

669
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:48,159
Thanks for meeting me here, Mom.

670
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:52,955
I had something
that I wanted to ask you in person.

671
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:54,623
What, honey?

672
00:38:57,084 --> 00:39:01,088
[sighs] Is the reason
you're so obsessed with the Farm...

673
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:04,467
because they let you talk to Charles?

674
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:08,387
[scoffs]

675
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:11,640
Yeah.

676
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:16,562
Yes, I see my son.

677
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:19,315
And it's like I never lost him.

678
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:23,694
You would love your brother, Elizabeth.

679
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:27,323
He's the most beautiful boy
I have ever seen.

680
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:32,078
Being with him is unlike anything
I could ever imagine.

681
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,873
And it's all because of Edgar.

682
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,962
Edgar brought me my son.

683
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:42,880
Mom...

684
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,467
Can I meet him?

685
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,802
Charles?

686
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:48,886
Edgar.

687
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:00,731
[Edgar] Ah.

688
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:01,649
Well...

689
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:05,736
I was wondering when we'd finally meet.

690
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,823
Me, too, Mr. Evernever.

691
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:11,951
You've been busy.

692
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,414
You know, Betty,

693
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:21,752
I could always ask your mother and sister
to give their testimony again.

694
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:26,048
And who's to say I don't have copies
of those tapes in storage...

695
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:28,300
off-site?

696
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:32,430
There.

697
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:33,764
So, please...

698
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:35,683
tell me.

699
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,478
What do you want to know?

700
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:43,816
Everything.

701
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:48,821
Start from the beginning.

702
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:52,867
[boy] Archie.

703
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,369
I found this outside.

704
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:01,250
-Is there Fresh-Aid in this?
-No.

705
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:03,461
But there's a Quest Card.

706
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,672
"Defang the wolf cub."

707
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,177
Looks like a tooth.

708
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:16,223
Jug...

709
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:18,225
Baby Teeth.

710
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:21,312
Or what's left of him.

711
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:27,610
Terry, I'm getting close to the clearing
that the hiker called about, but...

712
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,113
I don't see any---
