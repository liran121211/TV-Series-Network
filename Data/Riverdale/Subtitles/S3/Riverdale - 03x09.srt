Yeah, well,
the Sisters really did a number on them.

344
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:19,468
Any luck getting the Sisters
to testify against Hiram?

345
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,097
They've taken a vow of silence.

346
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,016
It's part of their religion.

347
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,059
Religion?

348
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,185
Mm-hm.

349
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,020
Betty.

350
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,860
As a social worker, I've had dealings
with the Sisters over the years.

351
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:39,989
And there's something you need to know
about their affiliation with the Church.

352
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:42,658
[VERONICA] <i>Josie was stalked, Daddy.</i>

353
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,243
By those Gargoyles of yours.

354
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:47,496
So, tell me, if I'm paying you
ten percent for protection,

355
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,248
why is my headliner harassed?

356
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:52,251
Because you had the audacity
to try to deceive me.

357
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:55,379
Cooking the books?
That's the move of a rank amateur.

358
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,923
Now I want the full amount I'm owed.

359
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,551
And your mother's Glamergé Egg
that was stolen.

360
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,804
- Come again?
- One of your Serpent school chums

361
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:06,640
broke into our apartment
and stole your mother's bauble.

362
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:08,851
And based on the calling
card they left...

363
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:12,605
I'm guessing it's
probably Cheryl Blossom.

364
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,691
Anyway, get it back for me, won't you?

365
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,276
Why is this my responsibility?

366
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,278
Because you have more to lose than me.

367
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,865
[VERONICA] <i>You need
to fix this, Jughead.</i>

368
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,826
If Cheryl took the Egg, why come to me?
Why not go to her?

369
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:27,787
She's dodging my phone calls.

370
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,080
Besides, aren't you her king?

371
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,417
- Why are you and your father aligned?
- We're not.

372
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,462
He's squeezing me.
He's squeezing my business.

373
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:39,632
Now, not only does he
have me paying him protection,

374
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:43,761
he's got me on this wild-goose chase
to get my mom's stolen Egg back.

375
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:47,556
- You pay your father protection money?
- Against his very own Gargoyle Gang.

376
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:52,937
What if you pay less money
not to be in business with him?

377
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,773
- What are you suggesting?
- Let the Serpents work for you.

378
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,108
Get real protection
from your father's goons.

379
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,528
And the Serpents get jobs,
with a steady income.

380
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:01,529
This is a win-win.

381
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,242
Get me that Glamergé Egg back,
and we have an accord.

382
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,497
Your turn, Red.

383
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:19,547
"Defeat the Hooded Specter of Death."

384
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:22,925
Go on.

385
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:28,806
The challenge reveals the weakness.

386
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:31,225
The weakness is
what keeps you from winning.

387
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,033
[MAN] Give me your wallet!

388
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:03,173
[GUNSHOT]

389
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,140
[ARCHIE] I did it.

390
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,517
Now am I finished playing this game?

391
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,562
[NORTON] The Red Paladin returns.

392
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:18,814
[ARCHIE] Warden Norton?

393
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:20,900
Take a load off, my boy.

394
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,902
We're just getting started.

395
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,783
I won't play the game
with someone who died from it.

396
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:31,201
I didn't die.

397
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,495
I ascended to the kingdom.

398
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,915
And what about Joaquin?
Did he ascend, too?

399
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:38,709
That was his reward for stabbing me,
wasn't it?

400
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,961
That was the card Mr. DeSantos drew.

401
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,005
His do-or-die moment.

402
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:46,258
You know all about those,
don't you, Archie?

403
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,093
Didn't you have one yourself?

404
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:49,178
With the Black Hood?

405
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:50,471
Yes.

406
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:56,518
And I stopped him, but I'm still
trapped here, in this hell.

407
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,020
Then that wasn't the moment.

408
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:01,482
The place and time
where it all went wrong.

409
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,067
Roll the dice,

410
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:06,987
and you may find the path
that leads back to Eldervair.

411
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:12,326
We know your secret, Sister Woodhouse.

412
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:15,204
The Church disbanded
the Sisters of Quiet Mercy

413
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,330
during Vatican II,

414
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:20,542
over allegations
of cruel and inhumane practices.

415
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:25,381
You and your sisters haven't been nuns
for more than 60 years.

416
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:29,134
Which means your vow of silence
won't hold up in court.

417
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:30,552
Here's the new deal.

418
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,346
Testify against Hiram Lodge,

419
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:35,265
and I won't have you charged
with the following crimes:

420
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:39,269
Child endangerment,
illegal drug testing, human trafficking.

421
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:44,858
[SIGHS]

422
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,193
Fine.

423
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:49,697
What do I need to do?

424
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:53,242
Swear in court that Hiram
Lodge gave you money and drugs

425
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,493
for illegal testing.

426
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,120
You'll have immunity.

427
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,332
[JUGHEAD] <i>Serpents.</i>

428
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,500
Earlier today...

429
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:03,919
I brokered a deal.

430
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:07,464
Got us a paid gig.

431
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:10,843
From here on out,
we'll be working security detail

432
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:14,013
for Veronica Lodge,
her speakeasy, and her employees.

433
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:16,557
- Long live the Serpents. Whoo!
- [ALL CHEERING]

434
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:18,517
Settle down.

435
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,271
It's good news,
but I've also gathered us here

436
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,814
for less celebratory reasons.

437
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:27,818
Cheryl, Toni.

438
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:30,904
- Come up here.
- Excuse me?

439
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:33,115
What did we do?

440
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:36,952
You broke into the Lodge apartment
and stole a Glamergé Egg.

441
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:40,956
So what if we did?

442
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,792
Well, more than that,
you left your calling card...

443
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,879
attaching yourself, and, by extension,

444
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,714
all of the Serpents to your crime.

445
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:49,965
I'm not afraid of Lodge.

446
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:51,300
What's he gonna do?

447
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,384
Call the sheriff?

448
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:55,637
- Oh, right, there is no sheriff.
- That's not the point.

449
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:56,722
You broke the Code.

450
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:01,101
- Turn in your jackets and go.
- [TONI] Are you serious?

451
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:04,730
I'm a Serpent by blood.
You can't take that away from me.

452
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,607
[CHERYL] You hypocrite.

453
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,984
Give your buddy Fangs a pass,
but crucify us?

454
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:13,030
In case you're wondering how we know,
Fangs told Sweet Pea, who told me.

455
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:14,031
Who told me.

456
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:18,619
If you ask for our jackets,
shouldn't you ask for his?

457
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,250
Jug.

458
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,589
You're right.

459
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:34,176
- Fangs, give me your jacket.
- Hey. What the hell, man?

460
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:35,761
It's okay, Sweet Pea.

461
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:56,532
Some leader you are.

462
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:58,075
Fangs.

463
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:03,789
[JUGHEAD] Cheryl? Toni?

464
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,708
We'll go, but we're keeping our jackets.

465
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:09,378
Fine. But I need that Egg back.

466
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:11,171
Come again?

467
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:12,965
You need to give me that damn Egg.

468
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,259
Or Veronica won't give us the contract.

469
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,177
Why would I care? I'm not a Serpent.

470
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:19,847
Because I believe
that you still have honor, Cheryl.

471
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,224
And it's getting cold out,

472
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:25,060
and the rest of us don't
get to go back to Thistlehouse.

473
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:30,566
[VERONICA] Well done, <i>Torombolo.</i>

474
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:34,111
Cost me a lot to get that ugly
thing back. You put it to good use.

Oh, don't you worry, I shall.

476
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:37,573
And in the meantime,

00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,825
you and the Serpents have
your first assignment.

00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:43,036

00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,584
You lied to us.

00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:53,255
- What do you mean? I would never.
- You said he was dead, but I saw him.

482
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:56,133
I saw the Gargoyle King.

00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:01,263

00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,389
Fox Forest.

486
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:07,060
He was there, with other Gargoyles,
his gang. They beat me up.

487
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:08,812
The Gryphon Queen is a liar.

488
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:11,440
And if she lied
about the Gargoyle King being dead,

489
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:15,235
- maybe she lied when she says we're safe.
- I'm not. You have to believe me.

490
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:18,572
The Sisters are going
to testify against the Man in Black,

491
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,199
and then you will all be safe.

492
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:21,366
Where, Betty?

493
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,243
Where will we be safe?

494
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:33,712
It's your turn, Red Paladin.

495
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,380
Go on.

496
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,008
Pick your Quest Card.

497
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,518
What does it say?

498
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:51,980
"Kill the Gargoyle King."

499
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:53,190
Are you sure?

500
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,150
Read it again.

501
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,198
"Kill the Man in Black."

502
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,201
You have your marching orders.

503
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:07,204
Slay the dragon.

504
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:11,792
Good luck.

00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:48,912
The Gargoyle King.

00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,623
The Man in Black.

507
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:56,378
How many names do you have, Hiram?

508
00:29:58,088 --> 00:29:59,256
I know why you've come.

509
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:05,262
Do you genuinely think
killing me will solve all your problems?

510
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,888
It's what I should've done that night.

511
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:10,559
In here, my do-or-die moment,
before you had me arrested.

512
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:13,645
Yeah, it was awfully stupid of you
to come in here,

513
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,230
threaten me,

514
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,441
tell me all your plans.

515
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,151
