1
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:09,759
[narrator] Previously on Riverdale:

2
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:12,387
I propose a truce.

3
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:15,098
You don't make a move against me,
I won't make a move against you.

4
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:16,891
You can't fight your destiny.

5
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:17,976
No. Don't!

6
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:21,146
[Betty] The warden also called Archie
a Red Paladin.

7
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:24,024
-[Archie] They marked you for sacrifice.
-[Ricky] I gave it to myself.

8
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:26,026
[Archie] I let my guard down for a second.

9
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,819
Maybe time to make this thing
come to a head.

10
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:30,405
Gotta take drastic action, boy.
Words won't do it.

11
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:32,657
I agree. Something that gives us purpose.

12
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,369
Mobilizing that gang search
for Archie's lost boy gave me the idea.

13
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:39,456
We've come up with a plan,
to deputize the Serpents.

14
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:40,749
We're in escrow. I sold the house.

15
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,334
-[Betty] To who?
-[Alice] Some anonymous buyer.

16
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:44,669
[smoke alarm beeping]

17
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,546
My God.

18
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:48,840
We'll figure out a payment plan
for the rest.

19
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:50,759
-Understood.
-[Gladys] In exchange...

20
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:52,761
-You lend me those wheels.
-Not Bella.

21
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:55,722
One more thing.
Don't tell Jughead about our business.

22
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:59,142
Everything's going how you said.
Got Dad wrapped around my pinkie.

23
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,519
We moved to the right place
at the right time.

24
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,605
I could feel it. Hmm.

25
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:08,943
[Jughead]
What exactly is the American Dream?

26
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,405
For my dad,
on the eve of his 50th birthday,

27
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,907
the American dream was this:

28
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:15,366
A father,

29
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:16,576
a mother,

30
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:17,952
son,

31
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:19,204
a daughter,

32
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:20,830
a loyal hound,

33
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,165
food on the table.

34
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,375
The only thing missing was...

35
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:27,420
Eat up. Because when we're done,
we're taking a little ride.

36
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:28,505
Where to, Mom?

37
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:31,007
Well, that's a surprise, JB.

38
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,926
I think you're gonna like it.

39
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:33,927
You, too, old man.

40
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,303
Who you calling old?

41
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:38,014
Aw, come here. You're all cockeyed.

42
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,307
[Gladys chuckles]

43
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,569
[Gladys laughing]

44
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:55,448
-[Jughead] What are we doing here?
-It's an early birthday gift for your dad.

45
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,033
I mean, for all of us.

46
00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:59,410
Just closed on it a few days ago.

47
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,745
-Gladys...
-Mom...

48
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,455
What?

49
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,585
What the hell is Alice Cooper doing
in my house?

50
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,213
-FP?
-Jug?

51
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:13,424
Mrs. Jones.

52
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:17,345
Are you the anonymous buyer?

53
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,806
[FP] What the hell happened here?

54
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,016
[Alice] Oh, uh...

55
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,727
We had a minor mishap with a candle.

56
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:28,148
Nothing that a fresh coat of paint
or new set of curtains won't fix.

57
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,274
I'm so confused.

58
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,526
You sold our house to the Joneses?

59
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:32,986
-Not to me.
-Not to me.

60
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,362
I bought it.

61
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,406
I made an all-cash offer online.

62
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,866
Mom, we can't move in here.

63
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,535
-Why the hell not?
-Because it's Betty's house.

64
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,539
There's definitely been some sort
of misunderstanding.

65
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:47,792
I think we should all just walk away
from this.

66
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,545
That won't be necessary.

67
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,589
-Not as far as I'm concerned.
-Mom.

68
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:56,009
This house is my past,
and I just want to be done with it.

69
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,348
-We're obviously not going to move in.
-How much you wanna bet?

70
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:05,643
My mom wants to sell it,
your mom wants to buy it. It's done.

71
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,812
Well, if that is the case...

72
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:12,442
one good thing is that you could just
stay in your room. Live with us.

73
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,405
I don't know, Jug.

74
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:21,034
Living with your family,
when I don't even know your mom that well.

75
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,202
What were you gonna do?

76
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,287
Crash at Vee's,

77
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,581
which I think I should still do

78
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,917
until I figure things out.

79
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,002
-Is that okay?
-Yeah. Of course.

80
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,881
Still up for breakfast
with the Marked Man?

81
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:38,343
Yeah.

82
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,970
Here's the deal, Archie.
I checked with my dad,

83
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,848
who pulled all the files on Warden Norton
after he committed suicide.

84
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,184
They cleared out his office,
and found this.

85
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,187
A Quest Card.

86
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,815
"Kill the Red Paladin."
Like the one Ricky had.

87
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,901
These two cards are identical.

88
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,945
Has the same design, same card stock.

89
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,239
To me that indicates
that someone printed out

90
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:02,742
multiple "Kill the Red Paladin" cards,
put them out into the world.

91
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,203
[Betty] We need to find out who.

92
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,622
I know where to start.

93
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,332
[Cheryl] So, what do you think?

94
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,417
Perfect for Quebec, n'est-ce pas?

95
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:14,212
I don't understand. Who's going to Quebec?

96
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:17,382
I thought, since you've been working
so hard with the Pretty Poisons,

97
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:20,009
it might be good for us
to get away together,

98
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,513
so, I booked us a spring break ski trip
to Mont Blanc.

99
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:27,642
Me and the Pretty Poisons were planning
on a road trip to Sugar Lake.

100
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,435
Fine.

101
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:33,147
We don't have to go to the mountains,
or anywhere, ever.

102
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,441
-I'm not saying that, Cheryl. Look--
-[cell phone beeps]

103
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:40,029
Shoot. Sorry, I'm running late for work.
Can we talk about this later?

104
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,955
Archie. Long time. How have you been?

105
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:51,040
I was doing pretty good, Mr. Lodge.

106
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,918
Until a homeless kid stabbed me
in my house.

107
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,045
Did this person break in?

108
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:56,963
No.

109
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,717
But he did have one of these.

110
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:04,512
You recognize it?

111
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,099
I, um...

112
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,435
You started that quest.

113
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:14,272
"Kill the Red Paladin."
With Warden Norton.

114
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:18,484
And Tall Boy, when he was working for you,
referred to me as the Red Paladin.

115
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,778
Even if he did, Archie,
it's all in the past.

116
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:21,821
We have a truce.

117
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:24,407
Did you give a Quest Card
to Warden Norton?

118
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,787
-Yes.
-Did you give out any others?

119
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,290
I...

120
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:35,752
I printed out an even dozen
of these Quest Cards.

121
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,296
I gave three to Norton
and nine to Tall Boy

122
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:41,257
to distribute amongst the more...

123
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:43,926
fanatical players.

124
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,678
Well, truce or no truce,

125
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,306
the clock you wound up is still running,
Mr. Lodge.

126
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:51,309
There's other players out there,
waiting to kill me,

127
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,102
that I now need to track down.

128
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:57,857
Right. I might be able
to help you with that.

129
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,526
While I briefly distributed Fizzle Rocks,

130
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,654
my soldiers like Tall Boy would
make drop-offs and pick-ups

131
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:06,366
to various hotspots around town.

132
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,992
-Hotspots?
-Yes.

133
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:11,079
Where like-minded individuals would gather
to do Fizzle Rocks

134
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:13,247
and play Gryphons and Gargoyles.

135
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:17,627
Here's a list of the locations.
Players you're looking for might be there.

136
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:29,597
Hey, Red Hot, what's in the basket?

137
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,558
Freshly baked cherry scones
for my Tee-Tee.

138
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:36,312
Gesture of goodwill after a disagreement.
Where's she stationed tonight?

139
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:39,982
You'll see her downstairs.

140
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:48,324

I swear I didn't know Gladys was

148
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:23,609
[sighs] Listen, FP, I want you to know,
that house means nothing to me.

149
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,031
Wish I could say the same
about you and Gladys.

150
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,579
Alice, uh...

151
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,625
She and I, we're still married.

152
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,210
Yeah.

153
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,213
Gladys left you and Jughead.
Don't forget that.

154
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,381
That was my fault.

155
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,677
I was a no-good husband, a rotten father.

156
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,721
Do you love her, FP?

157
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,142
She's the mother of my children.

158
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,314
And me?

159
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:04,525
Do you love me?

160
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,280
It doesn't matter now.

161
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,407
It's over.

162
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:15,620
I'm sorry.

163
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,084
Ronnie, can we talk business?

164
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,713
Always. What's up?

165
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,883
I've invested a lot of time here.

166
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,011
Being a bartender, a bouncer,

167
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:35,139
a delivery man, pit boss, you name it.

168
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,266
I've also made sacrifices.

169
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,809
Like giving my car to Gladys.

170
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,187
So, I've been thinking,

171
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,606
I wanna be your business partner.

172
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:49,987
Reggie...

173
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:56,702
you have been nothing
but helpful and dedicated.

174
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:00,540
But I still owe a hefty debt
to my father and Gladys.

175
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:07,255
It just wouldn't be wise for me
to begin another partnership right now.

176
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,674
Veronica, I know what I'm worth.

177
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:12,260
You should know, too.

178
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,177
Believe me...

179
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:15,429
I do.

180
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,641
But to quote my abuelita,

181
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:22,520
no one walks on water in my place...

182
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,065
except me.

183
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,322
[Jughead] Can I ask you
about buying the Cooper house?

184
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,283
Sure. What about it?

185
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:36,867
[sighs]

186
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,997
Seems awfully convenient, doesn't it?
That particular house.

187
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,082
Also seems pretty permanent.

188
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:47,295
Yeah, I've been looking at real estate
in Riverdale for a while now.

189
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:50,464
-Where'd you get that money?
-I sold the chop shop in Toledo.

190
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,509
Is there a problem, Jug?

191
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,427
No.

192
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,723
Just since you've been back,
you've made...

193
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,100
what some people would call shady moves.

194
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:04,353
Buying the Cooper house,
foisting the Gargoyles on me.

195
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:08,024
I'm sorry. Why are you so suspicious
of me all of a sudden?

196
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:11,444
We haven't had a single conversation
since you've been back.

197
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:14,447
I don't know what your plan is,
what you're doing here.

198
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:20,077
It did me good,
to see you and your dad in Toledo.

199
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:25,082
It reminded me of what I'd been missing.

200
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,377
The entire family together.

201
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:32,757
As for what I'm gonna do here,
I'm gonna get Jellybean in school...

202
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:37,178
find myself a job, maybe at a garage.

203
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,096
How's that all sound to you?

204
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,390
Sounds good.

205
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,477
Is it true?

206
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,437
[laughs] Oh, Jughead.

207
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,776
Look, your dad has got a sweet gig now.

208
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:54,695
We've got a house with rooms for everyone.

209
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,406
I'm looking at this thing like a do-over.

210
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,283
A chance to be a real family.

211
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,203
That's all I want.

212
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,793
Oh, no, that's not true.
There is one more thing.

213
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,753
It's, uh, your dad's 50th,

214
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,507
and I've decided to throw him
a little soiree at the speakeasy.

215
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:19,095
And I would really like it
if you gave the birthday speech.

216
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:22,139
You're the writer in the family.
What do you say?

217
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,228
-Yeah. Okay, I'll do it.
-[chuckles]

218
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:45,913
Today, the Serpents start a new chapter.

219
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:50,918
You're no longer outlaws.
You're law-keepers.

220
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,546
Which is why
I've got Tom Keller here to help.

221
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:56,590
He is the best damn sheriff
Riverdale has ever had.

222
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,593
[Keller] Thanks, FP.
That's quite an introduction. Um...

223
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,805
What we'll do over the next few months
will be like basic training.

224
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:07,435
Each junior deputy will be paired
with an officer who will then mentor them.

225
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,812
Jughead, boy, you're riding with me.

226
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,364
Did you ever think in a million years
that at 50

227
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,783
you'd be sitting in the driver's seat
of a sheriff's cruiser?

228
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,870
I never even imagined I'd make it to 50.

229
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,913
Figured that was my expiration date.

230
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,624
What'd you think was gonna happen?

231
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,088
Get myself killed or drink myself to death
like my old man.

232
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,759
In a way, I'm, uh, just happy to be here.

233
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,719
Happy to be alive.

234
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,474
What are you most proud of?

235
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,350
You.

236
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,852
And your sister. I'm, uh...

237
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,438
proud of you both.

238
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,652
So, we're really doing this?

239
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,363
Moving to the Northside,
into the Cooper house.

240
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,159
It's like a Norman Rockwell painting
with leather jackets.

241
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:07,411
You know, you and Jellybean deserve it.

242
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,038
And for the first time ever,

243
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,749
I'm in a place
where I can provide for my kids.

244
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:14,627
Put a real roof over your head,
food in your mouths.

245
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,003
Damn.

246
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,048
It took me 50 years to get here.

247
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,845
[man over radio] We've got a 10-23
at the Chock-lit Shoppe. Out.

248
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:26,931
Ten-four. On my way.

249
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,225
The hell is a 10-23?

250
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,476
[siren wailing]

251
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,769
[tires screeching]

252
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,359
Hey, Pop, what's going on?

253
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:43,572
Some Fizzle Rocks junkie spazzed out
and threw hot coffee all over Delores,

254
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,865
then ran out of here.

255
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:48,244
I thought Fizzle Rocks were gone.
This candy epidemic was over.

256
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,287
[FP] I heard rumblings, rumors,

257
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,790
that someone's looking
to reopen the candy store.

258
00:13:58,712 --> 00:13:59,672
I wonder who.

259
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,217
That's a good question.

260
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,729
Nana Rose, you haven't seen Toni,
have you?

261
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:19,108
Not since she gave me
an envelope of money.

262
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,068
Come again? Money for what?

263
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:25,322
I believe she called it...

264
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:26,991
rent.

265
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:28,450
Fascinating.

266
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:33,289
[Veronica] I've been thinking
about our conversation.

267
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,875
What's this?

268
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:39,670
It's what I consider to be a good,
fair starting salary for you.

269
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,964
So, I'm just a hired hand to you, Ronnie?

270
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,717
You think I'm busting my ass
to make minimum wage?

271
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,261
That's more than minimum wage, Reggie.

272
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,013
Enough to buy a clean conscience?

273
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:53,642
You know what?

274
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:56,604
Why don't you take the rest
of the night off,

275
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,481
clear your head,
and recalibrate your attitude?

276
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:00,691
Yeah.

277
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,110
That's a good call.

278
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,490
-[Jughead] And you believe Hiram?
-[Archie] I do.

279
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,242
He says he gave out 12 Quest Cards.

280
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,328
Well, he's nothing if not thorough.

281
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,998
Okay, so, that means there could be
as many as 10 cards still in play,

282
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,584
and that means we need to figure out
how to track them

283
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,920
and whoever's holding them down.

284
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,964
Mr. Lodge gave me a list of places
his dealers used to go,

285
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,591
where G&G players congregate.

286
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:28,010
"Suds Laundromat, Innuendo..."

287
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:29,970
These places are nearby.

288
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,723
Let's check them out.
Start with the comic book shop.

289
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:35,434
See if we can tap
into Riverdale's gaming network.

290
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:38,145
And so continues our nerdiest mystery yet.

291
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,860
[man] Princess Faye, it's your roll.

292
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,905
But you're down five hit points,
and the Hellhounds are gaining on--

293
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:52,034
You're not allowed back here.
This is a sacred space.

294
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:55,120
Sheath your sword, Game Master.
Just here to ask questions.

295
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:58,540
Sorry to interrupt your game,
but, uh, we're here because of this.

296
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,542
-Do you recognize it?
-Yes.

297
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:04,838
And we know who you are.
That quest is in play here.

298
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,340
Well, take your shot, then.

299
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,634
-Who gave it to you?
-The King.

300
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:12,054
The Gargoyle King came here?
The back room of a comic book store?

301
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,723
One of his disciples
delivered the Quest Card for him.

302
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,475
He wore a mask.

303
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:17,643
Didn't say much.

304
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,228
Was he delivering Fizzle Rocks?

305
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,564
Who has the card? One of you?

306
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,565
No one in this room.

307
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:27,319
Whoever does, why haven't they made
a play against the Red Paladin yet?

308
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,947
The Red Paladin is an advanced quest.

309
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,574
It takes time
to adequately prepare for it.

310
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,784
But they'll act on it.

311
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:37,329
And sooner or later,
they'll come for you, Red Paladin.

312
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:43,335
How are things with you and Jughead
now that his mom's back?

313
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:44,753
Good.

314
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:49,133
He told me I could stay in the house
with them, in my old room,

315
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:52,344
which feels just weird to me.

316
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:55,514
But I mean, I guess
I'd get to know his mom and sister better.

317
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,432
Why do you ask?

318
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,769
Betty, there's something I need
to tell you about Mrs. Jones.

319
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:01,687
What?

320
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,689
She swore me to secrecy, but...

321
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:08,027
I can't have you caught up in this,
not even by association.

322
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,361
Caught up in what, Vee?

323
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:14,199
I have insider information
that Gladys Jones

324
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:17,953
is taking over the drug trade
in Riverdale.

325
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:22,374
What, like Fizzle Rocks?
I thought all that stuff was gone now.

326
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,459
It was.

327
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:27,504
But like Gloria Swanson,
it's getting ready for a comeback.

328
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:30,591
With Gladys leading the charge,
instead of my father.

329
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:33,093
Vee, you need to tell me everything.

330
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,891
And then I have to tell Jughead.

331
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,694
It's a weird feeling.

332
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,656
Knowing there are all these strangers
who wanna kill me.

333
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,409
It's the game. It makes people crazy.

334
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:01,246
As a matter of fact,
those hardcore gamers are so obsessive,

335
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:04,124
any message from the Gargoyle King,
they take as gospel.

336
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,459
Maybe we can harness it.

337
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,252
Like when I became Gryphon Queen.

338
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:10,089
We know that the only way
to complete Hiram's quest

339
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,548
is to kill the Red Paladin.

340
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:15,844
But who says the Gargoyle King
can't add to his own quest,

341
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,262
offer a different outcome?

342
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:22,810
You guys remember in elementary school,
when it was snowing,

343
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,270
we played that game King of the Mountain?

344
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,188
Yeah, kind of.

345
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,189
Not really, no.

346
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,526
[Jughead] You won every time, Archie,
so we can play to your strengths.

347
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,653
I'll write an addendum to the quest

348
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:36,323
that says the Red Paladin
will defend his mountaintop for 12 hours,

349
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:37,241
dusk till dawn.

350
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,660
Anyone that has
the "Kill the Red Paladin" card

351
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,786
can try and take you down.

352
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,704
If they don't
by the time the challenge ends,

353
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,081
your mark of sacrifice is lifted.

354
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,332
-Let's do it.
-[Betty] Okay.

355
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,709
Well, if we're gonna do that, no weapons.

356
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,211
Hand-to-hand combat only.

357
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,088
Only one challenger at a time.

358
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,423
Perfect.
But we're still gonna need a space.

359
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,676
A mountaintop
to increase your chances of winning.

360
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,845
I know someone who can help provide that.

361
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,847
Get writing. I'll call you.

362
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:06,770
We'll watch over him.

363
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:10,065
I know it's risky,
but it's better to see them coming, right?

364
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,235
Right.

365
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,696

I heard from someone...

368
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,251
a source,

369
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:33,463
that Fizzle Rocks may be
coming back into Riverdale.

370
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,841
Yeah, my money's on it being Hiram again.

371
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:40,554
Actually, my source says
your mom is stepping in.

372
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:45,642

373
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,396
Who's your source?

374
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:50,814
I can't reveal that.

375
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,609
But I would not tell you this
if I didn't believe them.

376

They're trustworthy.

377
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:58,530
Okay.

378
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,909

-What?

379
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,619
-Let me help you.
-No.

380
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,122
Thank you for telling me, Betty.

381
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,541
But let me do this on my own.

382
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:13,253
Plus we have Archie's quest to finish.
I'll tell you if I find anything.

383
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:18,008
[Archie] I have a request.

384
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,802
I need somewhere to host
and end my Red Paladin challenge.

385
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,638
Your what now?

386
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,934
I'm calling in everyone
who has one of your Quest Cards.

387
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:29,186
And since you got me into this mess,

388
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,563
I figured you'd help
find an appropriate spot.

389
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:36,818
As a matter of fact,

390
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:41,156
I recently acquired a city block
near Sweetwater Docks,

391
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,575
where there are various
shuttered businesses,

392
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:47,454
including a hole-in-the-wall boxing gym.

393
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,915
Right now, it's just sitting there.

394
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,501
You're welcome to use it.

395
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,131
Thank you, Mr. Lodge.

Found a place for the mountaintop.
An old boxing gym by the docks.

399
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:31,123
I'll add it to the new quest,
have the guys distribute it how Hiram did.

00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,624
Awesome. See you at dusk?

401

See you at dusk.

go to the old comic shop.

Old Deuteronomy and Weasel,
you'll hit Innuendo.

Termite and Jinx, All About the Glaze.

405
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,763
We need to canvass all of Hiram's hotspots
if we're gonna get the word out fast.

-What about these masks?
-Wear them.

407
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:51,393
Remember, the goal is
to try and convince them

408
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:54,104
that this quest came directly
from the Gargoyle King.

409

We're on it.

410

And there's one more thing.

411
00:21:58,191 --> 00:21:59,443
It's kind of personal.

412

These aren't just gaming hotspots.

413
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:03,071
They were hubs
for Hiram's Fizzle Rock trade.

414

that a new player is moving in
to restart it.

I want you guys to suss any information
that you can, discreetly.

417
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:14,291
And if you find anything,
I want you to come to me, and only me.

make it up to you in some way.

so reckless?

00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:53,643

Um...

539
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:02,277
But I think we need to talk
about what's going on between us.

540
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,406
What is that, exactly?

541
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:10,410
I think you have a problem
with the Poisons

542
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:13,329

I'm in charge of something,

and you're not.

544
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,164
False.

545
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:18,251
I'm upset because
you wanna spend all your time with them

And yet...

550
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:27,802
I can't spend all my time cooped up
in that house,

551
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,220
-and your bedroom.
-Our bedroom.

552
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:30,305
That's exactly it.

553
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:35,059
It doesn't feel like our bedroom.
It's entirely yours, your space.

554
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:39,188
It sounds, Toni,
like you regret moving in with me.

555
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,359
Well, maybe it was too soon.

556
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,029

[Archie] Thank you for loaning me the gym.

562
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:07,884
Hmm.

563
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:11,512
But, yes,
the quest you set in motion is finished.

Very good, Archie.

565
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:21,272
No, I want you to keep those.

566
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,068

00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:26,569
I...

568
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:30,156
appreciate you helping me out
this week, Mr. Lodge.

569
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:31,866
But I don't wanna be in your debt.

570
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,077
It's not a debt, Archie.
It's compensation.

571
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,246
It's a way for me to make amends,
since I was responsible

572
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,500
for launching the Red Paladin quest
in the first place.

573
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,545
Take the keys.

574
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:46,506

Hey, can I help?

579
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:10,279
You can start by telling me
what's gotten into you.

580
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:16,160
Are you seriously self-destructing
because I won't make you my partner?

581
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:17,412
Partly.

582
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:20,373
I have an issue
with how I'm being treated by you.

583
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:21,624
Really?

584
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:24,002
I wanna be more than just your errand boy,

585
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:25,712
or pit boss,

586
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:27,714
or casual hookup.

587
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:31,134
I wanna matter, Ronnie.

588
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:32,635
You do matter.

589
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:37,473
And lest we forget,
I just went through a wrenching breakup.

590
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:39,100
Just a few months ago.

591
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,145
So, yeah, I'm taking things slow.

592
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:43,271
Answer me honestly.

593
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,984
Would we even be dating
if not for the speakeasy?

594
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:53,948
Probably not.

595
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,784
But I'm glad we are.

596
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:57,702
Aren't you?

597
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:01,497
I've given up so much for you.

598
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:05,918
I feel like you owe me.
And I'm not getting an ounce in return.

601

Now we don't owe each other anything.

You guys had a hell of a night.

It was mainly Archie.
What about you? Find anything?

to get the family back together,

but instead to take the drug trade
from Hiram Lodge.

610

I never was one for small-town gossip.

Is it true?

00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,165
Yeah, it's true.

613
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:27,708
Why?

614
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,169

No. You don't get to put this on us.

This is criminal. And it's selfish.

620
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,891
Since when is taking care of my family
a selfish act?

621
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,435
Do you even know
where your dad and I come from?

622

Hmm? No one ever handed us anything.

623
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,774
We had to hustle and scam

624
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,901
to make sure there was food on the table

625
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,362

and Jellybean had a place to sleep.

that we had to do?

But we did our best, and we survived,

which is all your father ever wanted.

knowing how you paid for it.

say a word to him.

Maybe for the last time.

634
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,473

I'm so sorry to hear about Toni.

Oh, Kevin. Are you familiar
with the phrase "que sera sera"?

657
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:54,438
Sure. It means,
"Whatever will be, will be."

658
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,148
Yeah. It's also heavily featured

659
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:58,651

high-school black comedy Heathers.

00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:40,961
[crowd chuckles]

695
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,883
I remember when you made me promise
not to stop writing. Not for anything.

696
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,385
And I haven't.

697
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:49,970
I've written every day.

698
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:53,307
But I could punch keys every night
in a booth at Pop's,

699
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:57,186
and never come up with a story
nearly as remarkable as yours.

700
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,939
You've gone
from the wrong side of the tracks

701
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:01,816
to the right side of the law.

702
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:05,361
From Serpent King to Sheriff of Riverdale.

703
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:07,863
From a man
that most people in this town...

704
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:10,366
had probably written off...

705
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:14,662
to someone that righted his wrongs...

706
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,749
and brought our family back together.

707
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:22,128
That's who you are to me.

708
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,715
Someone that would do anything
for his family.

709
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:39,103
There's something you need to know
about this family.

710
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,361
We'll always be there for you.

711
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:48,904
Me...

712
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:51,157
Jellybean, and Mom.

713
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,369
I'm proud to be your son.

714
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,039
I'm proud to share your name.

715
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,127
And I am proud...

716
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:05,546
to be part of your...

717
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:08,174
amazing story.

718
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:12,344
Here's to 50, Dad.

719
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,140
And to 50 more.

720
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:17,308
[all cheering]

721
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,244
That was a beautiful speech, Jug.

722
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:38,913
Thanks.

723
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:40,664
Most of it was true.

724
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:44,543
[Betty sighs]

725
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:46,003
What are you gonna do now?

726
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:51,842
Save Jellybean, protect my dad,
and run my mom out of town.

727
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,011
Do you wanna help?
