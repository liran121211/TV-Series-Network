00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:09,759
[narrator] Previously on Riverdale:

2
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:12,387
I propose a truce.

3
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:15,098
You don't make a move against me,
I won't make a move against you.

4
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:16,891
You can't fight your destiny.

5
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:17,976
No. Don't!

6
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:21,146
[Betty] The warden also called Archie
a Red Paladin.

7
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:24,024
-[Archie] They marked you for sacrifice.
-[Ricky] I gave it to myself.

8
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:26,026
[Archie] I let my guard down for a second.

9
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,819
Maybe time to make this thing
come to a head.

10
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:30,405
Gotta take drastic action, boy.
Words won't do it.

11
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:32,657
I agree. Something that gives us purpose.

12
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,369
Mobilizing that gang search
for Archie's lost boy gave me the idea.

13
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:39,456
We've come up with a plan,
to deputize the Serpents.

14
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:40,749
We're in escrow. I sold the house.

15
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,334
-[Betty] To who?
-[Alice] Some anonymous buyer.

16
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:44,669
[smoke alarm beeping]

17
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,546
My God.

18
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:48,840
We'll figure out a payment plan
for the rest.

19
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:50,759
-Understood.
-[Gladys] In exchange...

20
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:52,761
-You lend me those wheels.
-Not Bella.

21
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:55,722
One more thing.
Don't tell Jughead about our business.

22
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:59,142
Everything's going how you said.
Got Dad wrapped around my pinkie.

23
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,519
We moved to the right place
at the right time.

24
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,605
I could feel it. Hmm.

25
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:08,943
[Jughead]
What exactly is the American Dream?

26
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,405
For my dad,
on the eve of his 50th birthday,

27
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,907
the American dream was this:

28
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:15,366
A father,

29
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:16,576
a mother,

30
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:17,952
son,

31
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:19,204
a daughter,

32
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:20,830
a loyal hound,

33
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,165
food on the table.

34
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,375
The only thing missing was...

35
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:27,420
Eat up. Because when we're done,
we're taking a little ride.

36
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:28,505
Where to, Mom?

37
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:31,007
Well, that's a surprise, JB.

38
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,926
I think you're gonna like it.

39
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:33,927
You, too, old man.

40
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,303
Who you calling old?

41
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:38,014
Aw, come here. You're all cockeyed.

42
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,307
[Gladys chuckles]

43
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,569
[Gladys laughing]

44
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:55,448
-[Jughead] What are we doing here?
-It's an early birthday gift for your dad.

45
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,033
I mean, for all of us.

46
00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:59,410
Just closed on it a few days ago.

47
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,745
-Gladys...
-Mom...

48
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,455
What?

49
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,585
What the hell is Alice Cooper doing
in my house?

50
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,213
-FP?
-Jug?

51
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:13,424
Mrs. Jones.

52
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:17,345
Are you the anonymous buyer?

53
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,806
[FP] What the hell happened here?

54
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,016
[Alice] Oh, uh...

55
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,727
We had a minor mishap with a candle.

56
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:28,148
Nothing that a fresh coat of paint
or new set of curtains won't fix.

57
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,274
I'm so confused.

58
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,526
You sold our house to the Joneses?

59
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:32,986
-Not to me.
-Not to me.

60
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,362
I bought it.

61
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,406
I made an all-cash offer online.

62
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,866
Mom, we can't move in here.

63
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,535
-Why the hell not?
-Because it's Betty's house.

64
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,539
There's definitely been some sort
of misunderstanding.

65
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:47,792
I think we should all just walk away
from this.

66
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,545
That won't be necessary.

67
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,589
-Not as far as I'm concerned.
-Mom.

68
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:56,009
This house is my past,
and I just want to be done with it.

69
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,348
-We're obviously not going to move in.
-How much you wanna bet?

70
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:05,643
My mom wants to sell it,
your mom wants to buy it. It's done.

71
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,812
Well, if that is the case...

72
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:12,442
one good thing is that you could just
stay in your room. Live with us.

73
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,405
I don't know, Jug.

74
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:21,034
Living with your family,
when I don't even know your mom that well.

75
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,202
What were you gonna do?

76
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,287
Crash at Vee's,

77
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,581
which I think I should still do

78
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,917
until I figure things out.

79
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,002
-Is that okay?
-Yeah. Of course.

80
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,881
Still up for breakfast
with the Marked Man?

81
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:38,343
Yeah.

82
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,970
Here's the deal, Archie.
I checked with my dad,

83
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,848
who pulled all the files on Warden Norton
after he committed suicide.

84
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,184
They cleared out his office,
and found this.

85
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,187
A Quest Card.

86
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,815
"Kill the Red Paladin."
Like the one Ricky had.

87
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,901
These two cards are identical.

88
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,945
Has the same design, same card stock.

89
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,239
To me that indicates
that someone printed out

90
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:02,742
multiple "Kill the Red Paladin" cards,
put them out into the world.

91
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,203
[Betty] We need to find out who.

92
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,622
I know where to start.

93
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,332
[Cheryl] So, what do you think?

94
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,417
Perfect for Quebec, n'est-ce pas?

95
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:14,212
I don't understand. Who's going to Quebec?

96
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:17,382
I thought, since you've been working
so hard with the Pretty Poisons,

97
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:20,009
it might be good for us
to get away together,

98
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,513
so, I booked us a spring break ski trip
to Mont Blanc.

99
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:27,642
Me and the Pretty Poisons were planning
on a road trip to Sugar Lake.

100
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,435
Fine.

101
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:33,147
We don't have to go to the mountains,
or anywhere, ever.

102
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,441
-I'm not saying that, Cheryl. Look--
-[cell phone beeps]

103
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:40,029
Shoot. Sorry, I'm running late for work.
Can we talk about this later?

104
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,955
Archie. Long time. How have you been?

105
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:51,040
I was doing pretty good, Mr. Lodge.

106
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,918
Until a homeless kid stabbed me
in my house.

107
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,045
Did this person break in?

108
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:56,963
No.

109
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,717
But he did have one of these.

110
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:04,512
You recognize it?

111
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,099
I, um...

112
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,435
You started that quest.

113
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:14,272
"Kill the Red Paladin."
With Warden Norton.

114
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:18,484
And Tall Boy, when he was working for you,
referred to me as the Red Paladin.

115
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,778
Even if he did, Archie,
it's all in the past.

116
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:21,821
We have a truce.

117
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:24,407
Did you give a Quest Card
to Warden Norton?

118
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,787
-Yes.
-Did you give out any others?

119
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,290
I...

120
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:35,752
I printed out an even dozen
of these Quest Cards.

121
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,296
I gave three to Norton
and nine to Tall Boy

122
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:41,257
to distribute amongst the more...

123
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:43,926
fanatical players.

124
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,678
Well, truce or no truce,

125
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,306
the clock you wound up is still running,
Mr. Lodge.

126
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:51,309
There's other players out there,
waiting to kill me,

127
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,102
that I now need to track down.

128
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:57,857
Right. I might be able
to help you with that.

129
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,526
While I briefly distributed Fizzle Rocks,

130
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,654
my soldiers like Tall Boy would
make drop-offs and pick-ups

131
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:06,366
to various hotspots around town.

132
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,992
-Hotspots?
-Yes.

133
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:11,079
Where like-minded individuals would gather
to do Fizzle Rocks

134
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:13,247
and play Gryphons and Gargoyles.

135
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:17,627
Here's a list of the locations.
Players you're looking for might be there.

136
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:29,597
Hey, Red Hot, what's in the basket?

137
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,558
Freshly baked cherry scones
for my Tee-Tee.

138
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:36,312
Gesture of goodwill after a disagreement.
Where's she stationed tonight?

139
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:39,982
You'll see her downstairs.

140
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:48,324
-â™ª [Call your girlfriend â™ª
-â™ª Call your girlfriend â™ª

141
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:52,537
-â™ª It's time you had the talk â™ª
-â™ª It's time you had the talk â™ª

142
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:55,915
-â™ª Give your reasons â™ª
-â™ª Give your reasons â™ª

143
00:06:56,707 --> 00:07:00,211
-â™ª Say it's not her fault â™ª
-â™ª Say it's not her fault â™ª

144
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:07,427
-â™ª But you just met somebody new â™ª
-â™ª But you just met somebody new â™ª

145
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,346
â™ª Don't you tell her
How I give you something â™ª

146
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,225
â™ª That you never even knew you missed â™ª

147
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:18,354
I swear I didn't know Gladys was
even looking at real estate.

148
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:23,609
[sighs] Listen, FP, I want you to know,
that house means nothing to me.

149
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,031
Wish I could say the same
about you and Gladys.

150
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,579
Alice, uh...

151
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,625
She and I, we're still married.

152
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,210
Yeah.

153
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,213
Gladys left you and Jughead.
Don't forget that.

154
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,381
That was my fault.

155
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,677
I was a no-good husband, a rotten father.

156
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,721
Do you love her, FP?

157
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,142
She's the mother of my children.

158
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,314
And me?

159
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:04,525
Do you love me?

160
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,280
It doesn't matter now.

161
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,407
It's over.

162
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:15,620
I'm sorry.

163
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,084
Ronnie, can we talk business?

164
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,713
Always. What's up?

165
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,883
I've invested a lot of time here.

166
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,011
Being a bartender, a bouncer,

167
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:35,139
a delivery man, pit boss, you name it.

168
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,266
I've also made sacrifices.

169
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,809
Like giving my car to Gladys.

170
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,187
So, I've been thinking,

171
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,606
I wanna be your business partner.

172
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:49,987
Reggie...

173
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:56,702
you have been nothing
but helpful and dedicated.

174
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:00,540
But I still owe a hefty debt
to my father and Gladys.

175
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:07,255
It just wouldn't be wise for me
to begin another partnership right now.

176
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,674
Veronica, I know what I'm worth.

177
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:12,260
You should know, too.

178
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,177
Believe me...

179
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:15,429
I do.

180
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,641
But to quote my abuelita,

181
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:22,520
no one walks on water in my place...

182
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,065
except me.

183
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,322
[Jughead] Can I ask you
about buying the Cooper house?

184
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,283
Sure. What about it?

185
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:36,867
[sighs]

186
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,997
Seems awfully convenient, doesn't it?
That particular house.

187
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,082
Also seems pretty permanent.

188
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:47,295
Yeah, I've been looking at real estate
in Riverdale for a while now.

189
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:50,464
-Where'd you get that money?
-I sold the chop shop in Toledo.

190
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,509
Is there a problem, Jug?

191
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,427
No.

192
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,723
Just since you've been back,
you've made...

193
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,100
what some people would call shady moves.

194
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:04,353
Buying the Cooper house,
foisting the Gargoyles on me.

195
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:08,024
I'm sorry. Why are you so suspicious
of me all of a sudden?

196
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:11,444
We haven't had a single conversation
since you've been back.

197
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:14,447
I don't know what your plan is,
what you're doing here.

198
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:20,077
It did me good,
to see you and your dad in Toledo.

199
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:25,082
It reminded me of what I'd been missing.

200
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,377
The entire family together.

201
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:32,757
As for what I'm gonna do here,
I'm gonna get Jellybean in school...

202
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:37,178
find myself a job, maybe at a garage.

203
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,096
How's that all sound to you?

204
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,390
Sounds good.

205
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,477
Is it true?

206
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,437
[laughs] Oh, Jughead.

207
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,776
Look, your dad has got a sweet gig now.

208
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:54,695
We've got a house with rooms for everyone.

209
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,406
I'm looking at this thing like a do-over.

210
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,283
A chance to be a real family.

211
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,203
That's all I want.

212
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,793
Oh, no, that's not true.
There is one more thing.

213
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,753
It's, uh, your dad's 50th,

214
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,507
and I've decided to throw him
a little soiree at the speakeasy.

215
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:19,095
And I would really like it
if you gave the birthday speech.

216
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:22,139
You're the writer in the family.
What do you say?

217
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,228
-Yeah. Okay, I'll do it.
-[chuckles]

218
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:45,913
Today, the Serpents start a new chapter.

219
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:50,918
You're no longer outlaws.
You're law-keepers.

220
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,546
Which is why
I've got Tom Keller here to help.

221
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:56,590
He is the best damn sheriff
Riverdale has ever had.

222
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,593
[Keller] Thanks, FP.
That's quite an introduction. Um...

223
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,805
What we'll do over the next few months
will be like basic training.

224
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:07,435
Each junior deputy will be paired
with an officer who will then mentor them.

225
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,812
Jughead, boy, you're riding with me.

226
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,364
Did you ever think in a million years
that at 50

227
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,783
you'd be sitting in the driver's seat
of a sheriff's cruiser?

228
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,870
I never even imagined I'd make it to 50.

229
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,913
Figured that was my expiration date.

230
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,624
What'd you think was gonna happen?

231
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,088
Get myself killed or drink myself to death
like my old man.

232
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,759
In a way, I'm, uh, just happy to be here.

233
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,719
Happy to be alive.

234
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,474
What are you most proud of?

235
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,350
You.

236
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,852
And your sister. I'm, uh...

237
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,438
proud of you both.

238
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,652
So, we're really doing this?

239
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,363
Moving to the Northside,
into the Cooper house.

240
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,159
It's like a Norman Rockwell painting
with leather jackets.

241
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:07,411
You know, you and Jellybean deserve it.

242
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,038
And for the first time ever,

243
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,749
I'm in a place
where I can provide for my kids.

244
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:14,627
Put a real roof over your head,
food in your mouths.

245
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,003
Damn.

246
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,048
It took me 50 years to get here.

247
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,845
[man over radio] We've got a 10-23
at the Chock-lit Shoppe. Out.

248
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:26,931
Ten-four. On my way.

249
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,225
The hell is a 10-23?

250
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,476
[siren wailing]

251
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,769
[tires screeching]

252
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,359
Hey, Pop, what's going on?

253
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:43,572
Some Fizzle Rocks junkie spazzed out
and threw hot coffee all over Delores,

254
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,865
then ran out of here.

255
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:48,244
I thought Fizzle Rocks were gone.
This candy epidemic was over.

256
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,287
[FP] I heard rumblings, rumors,

257
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,790
that someone's looking
to reopen the candy store.

258
00:13:58,712 --> 00:13:59,672
I wonder who.

259
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,217
That's a good question.

260
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,729
Nana Rose, you haven't seen Toni,
have you?

261
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:19,108
Not since she gave me
an envelope of money.

262
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,068
Come again? Money for what?

263
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:25,322
I believe she called it...

264
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:26,991
rent.

265
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:28,450
Fascinating.

266
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:33,289
[Veronica] I've been thinking
about our conversation.

267
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,875
What's this?

268
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:39,670
It's what I consider to be a good,
fair starting salary for you.

269
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,964
So, I'm just a hired hand to you, Ronnie?

270
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,717
You think I'm busting my ass
to make minimum wage?

271
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,261
That's more than minimum wage, Reggie.

272
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,013
Enough to buy a clean conscience?

273
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:53,642
You know what?

274
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:56,604
Why don't you take the rest
of the night off,

275
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,481
clear your head,
and recalibrate your attitude?

276
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:00,691
Yeah.

277
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,110
That's a good call.

278
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,490
-[Jughead] And you believe Hiram?
-[Archie] I do.

279
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,242
He says he gave out 12 Quest Cards.

280
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,328
Well, he's nothing if not thorough.

281
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,998
Okay, so, that means there could be
as many as 10 cards still in play,

282
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,584
and that means we need to figure out
how to track them

283
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,920
and whoever's holding them down.

284
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,964
Mr. Lodge gave me a list of places
his dealers used to go,

285
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,591
where G&G players congregate.

286
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:28,010
"Suds Laundromat, Innuendo..."

287
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:29,970
These places are nearby.

288
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,723
Let's check them out.
Start with the comic book shop.

289
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:35,434
See if we can tap
into Riverdale's gaming network.

290
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:38,145
And so continues our nerdiest mystery yet.

291
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,860
[man] Princess Faye, it's your roll.

292
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,905
But you're down five hit points,
and the Hellhounds are gaining on--

293
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:52,034
You're not allowed back here.
This is a sacred space.

294
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:55,120
Sheath your sword, Game Master.
Just here to ask questions.

295
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:58,540
Sorry to interrupt your game,
but, uh, we're here because of this.

296
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,542
-Do you recognize it?
-Yes.

297
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:04,838
And we know who you are.
That quest is in play here.

298
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,340
Well, take your shot, then.

299
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,634
-Who gave it to you?
-The King.

300
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:12,054
The Gargoyle King came here?
The back room of a comic book store?

301
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,723
One of his disciples
delivered the Quest Card for him.

302
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,475
He wore a mask.

303
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:17,643
Didn't say much.

304
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,228
Was he delivering Fizzle Rocks?

305
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,564
Who has the card? One of you?

306
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,565
No one in this room.

307
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:27,319
Whoever does, why haven't they made
a play against the Red Paladin yet?

308
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,947
The Red Paladin is an advanced quest.

309
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,574
It takes time
to adequately prepare for it.

310
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,784
But they'll act on it.

311
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:37,329
And sooner or later,
they'll come for you, Red Paladin.

312
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:43,335
How are things with you and Jughead
now that his mom's back?

313
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:44,753
Good.

314
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:49,133
He told me I could stay in the house
with them, in my old room,

315
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:52,344
which feels just weird to me.

316
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:55,514
But I mean, I guess
I'd get to know his mom and sister better.

317
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,432
Why do you ask?

318
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,769
Betty, there's something I need
to tell you about Mrs. Jones.

319
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:01,687
What?

320
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,689
She swore me to secrecy, but...

321
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:08,027
I can't have you caught up in this,
not even by association.

322
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,361
Caught up in what, Vee?

323
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:14,199
I have insider information
that Gladys Jones

324
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:17,953
is taking over the drug trade
in Riverdale.

325
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:22,374
What, like Fizzle Rocks?
I thought all that stuff was gone now.

326
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,459
It was.

327
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:27,504
But like Gloria Swanson,
it's getting ready for a comeback.

328
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:30,591
With Gladys leading the charge,
instead of my father.

329
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:33,093
Vee, you need to tell me everything.

330
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,891
And then I have to tell Jughead.

331
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,694
It's a weird feeling.

332
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,656
Knowing there are all these strangers
who wanna kill me.

333
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,409
It's the game. It makes people crazy.

334
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:01,246
As a matter of fact,
those hardcore gamers are so obsessive,

335
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:04,124
any message from the Gargoyle King,
they take as gospel.

336
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,459
Maybe we can harness it.

337
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,252
Like when I became Gryphon Queen.

338
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:10,089
We know that the only way
to complete Hiram's quest

339
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,548
is to kill the Red Paladin.

340
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:15,844
But who says the Gargoyle King
can't add to his own quest,

341
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,262
offer a different outcome?

342
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:22,810
You guys remember in elementary school,
when it was snowing,

343
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,270
we played that game King of the Mountain?

344
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,188
Yeah, kind of.

345
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,189
Not really, no.

346
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,526
[Jughead] You won every time, Archie,
so we can play to your strengths.

347
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,653
I'll write an addendum to the quest

348
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:36,323
that says the Red Paladin
will defend his mountaintop for 12 hours,

349
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:37,241
dusk till dawn.

350
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,660
Anyone that has
the "Kill the Red Paladin" card

351
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,786
can try and take you down.

352
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,704
If they don't
by the time the challenge ends,

353
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,081
your mark of sacrifice is lifted.

354
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,332
-Let's do it.
-[Betty] Okay.

355
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,709
Well, if we're gonna do that, no weapons.

356
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,211
Hand-to-hand combat only.

357
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,088
Only one challenger at a time.

358
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,423
Perfect.
But we're still gonna need a space.

359
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,676
A mountaintop
to increase your chances of winning.

360
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,845
I know someone who can help provide that.

361
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,847
Get writing. I'll call you.

362
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:06,770
We'll watch over him.

363
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:10,065
I know it's risky,
but it's better to see them coming, right?

364
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,235
Right.

365
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,696
It's better to see it coming.

366
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,414
[sighs]

367
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,207
I heard from someone...

368
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,251
a source,

369
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:33,463
that Fizzle Rocks may be
coming back into Riverdale.

370
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,841
Yeah, my money's on it being Hiram again.

371
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:40,554
Actually, my source says
your mom is stepping in.

372
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:45,642
Jug...

373
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,396
Who's your source?

374
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:50,814
I can't reveal that.

375
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,609
But I would not tell you this
if I didn't believe them.

376
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:54,735
They're trustworthy.

377
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:58,530
Okay.

378
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,909
-I'll look into it.
-What?

379
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,619
-Let me help you.
-No.

380
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,122
Thank you for telling me, Betty.

381
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,541
But let me do this on my own.

382
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:13,253
Plus we have Archie's quest to finish.
I'll tell you if I find anything.

383
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:18,008
[Archie] I have a request.

384
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,802
I need somewhere to host
and end my Red Paladin challenge.

385
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,638
Your what now?

386
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,934
I'm calling in everyone
who has one of your Quest Cards.

387
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:29,186
And since you got me into this mess,

388
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,563
I figured you'd help
find an appropriate spot.

389
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:36,818
As a matter of fact,

390
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:41,156
I recently acquired a city block
near Sweetwater Docks,

391
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,575
where there are various
shuttered businesses,

392
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:47,454
including a hole-in-the-wall boxing gym.

393
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,915
Right now, it's just sitting there.

394
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,501
You're welcome to use it.

395
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,131
Thank you, Mr. Lodge.

396
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:21,113
[cell phone buzzing]

397
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,157
Arch, any luck?

398
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:27,536
Found a place for the mountaintop.
An old boxing gym by the docks.

399
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:31,123
I'll add it to the new quest,
have the guys distribute it how Hiram did.

400
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,624
Awesome. See you at dusk?

401
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:33,709
See you at dusk.

402
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:39,047
Sweet Pea, Fangs,
go to the old comic shop.

403
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,633
Old Deuteronomy and Weasel,
you'll hit Innuendo.

404
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,635
Termite and Jinx, All About the Glaze.

405
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,763
We need to canvass all of Hiram's hotspots
if we're gonna get the word out fast.

406
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,390
-What about these masks?
-Wear them.

407
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:51,393
Remember, the goal is
to try and convince them

408
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:54,104
that this quest came directly
from the Gargoyle King.

409
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:55,522
We're on it.

410
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,190
And there's one more thing.

411
00:21:58,191 --> 00:21:59,443
It's kind of personal.

412
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,111
These aren't just gaming hotspots.

413
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:03,071
They were hubs
for Hiram's Fizzle Rock trade.

414
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,614
I've heard rumor

415
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:06,908
that a new player is moving in
to restart it.

416
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:10,245
I want you guys to suss any information
that you can, discreetly.

417
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:14,291
And if you find anything,
I want you to come to me, and only me.

418
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:16,877
Okay?

419
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,795
-Let's go.
-Yeah.

420
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:26,720
Reggie, what is going on?

421
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:30,849
Your bozo boy-toy here thought it wise
to try to steal his car back

422
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,476
before we settled our account.

423
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:34,227
Not smart.

424
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:38,482
Mrs. Jones, perhaps I can
make it up to you in some way.

425
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,400
How are you gonna do that?

426
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:46,114
Your husband's 50th at La Bonne Nuit.
Let me cover the expenses for that.

427
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:51,453
Done. But keep your arm candy
off my damn property.

428
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:13,767
How could you have done something
so reckless?

429
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:17,312
You know we're this close to paying off
our debt to her and my father.

430
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,022
-I'm sorry.
-You're sorry?

431
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,150
Reggie, this is how wars start.

432
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,444
Damn it, Veronica, I gave you everything.

433
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:27,280
I wanted to get my damn car back,
at least.

What are you doing here? I'm working.

442
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,812
I'm not here for you.
I was in the mood to gamble.

443
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:00,772
So, no ulterior motives, then?

444
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,107
Only to win, of course.

445
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:05,318
Now be a doll and fetch me a Bellini,
why don't you?

â™ª The confetti's all been thrown â™ª

00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:34,139
â™ª So be ready when we get up â™ª

453
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:38,268
Maybe we didn't allow enough time
for word to get around.

454
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,355
Maybe they didn't believe
it actually came from the...

[Berserker] I'm here for the Red Paladin.

457
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:55,285
[Jughead] Well...

458
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:57,621

00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,631
Welcome to the Iron Mountain.

461
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:10,675
Approach this hallowed battleground,

462
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,178
submit your "Kill the Red Paladin" card,

463
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:15,889
bring the Paladin to his knees
in three minutes,

464
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:17,307
and your quest is won.

465
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,227
However, should you run out of time,

466
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:24,648
should you fall to the Paladin's hand,
then your quest is over.

467
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,441
Is that understood?

468

469
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,195

you were casing the place.

And you wanted me to know it.

â™ª But I don't know if I'm a giver â™ª

516
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,314
â™ª I'm learning to live â™ª

517
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:37,150
â™ª I'm trying to be better â™ª

518
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:39,527
â™ª I'm learning to give â™ª

519
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,655
â™ª But I don't know if I'm a giver â™ª

520
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,241
â™ª I don't know if I'm a giver â™ª

521
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,789
â™ª I don't know if I'm a giver â™ª

522
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:57,420
This one's for the warden.

523
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:04,719
â™ª I got high hopes, lots of potential â™ª

524
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:07,347
â™ª I'm high, broke, searching for symbols â™ª

525
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,724
â™ª And I will not let go... â™ª

526
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:10,934
And this one's for me.

527
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:23,321
â™ª I'm trying to be better â™ª

528
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:27,450
â™ª I'm learning to give
I got so much soul in my body â™ª

529
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:30,453
â™ª But no one keeping me honest â™ª

530
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:34,624
-Yes!
-Whoo!

531
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,501
That was for me.

532
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:39,963
â™ª I'm trying to be better â™ª

533
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,131
A sacrifice no more.

534
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:44,759
[laughs]

535
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:50,139
That was hot.

536
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,725
And nice.

537
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:53,643
Agreed.

538
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:57,564
Um...

539
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:02,277
But I think we need to talk
about what's going on between us.

540
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,406
What is that, exactly?

541
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:10,410
I think you have a problem
with the Poisons

542
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:13,329
because for once,
I'm in charge of something,

543
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:14,247
and you're not.

544
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,164
False.

545
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:18,251
I'm upset because
you wanna spend all your time with them

546
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:19,168
instead of me.

547
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,086
Cheryl...

548
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,463
I love you.

549
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,549
And yet...

550
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:27,802
I can't spend all my time cooped up
in that house,

551
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,220
-and your bedroom.
-Our bedroom.

552
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:30,305
That's exactly it.

553
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:35,059
It doesn't feel like our bedroom.
It's entirely yours, your space.

554
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:39,188
It sounds, Toni,
like you regret moving in with me.

555
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,359
Well, maybe it was too soon.

556
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,029
Too fast.

557
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,447
[scoffs]

558
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:52,869
In that case, maybe you moving out
is exactly what needs to happen.

559
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:03,630
[Archie] Thank you for loaning me the gym.

560
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,757
Was it a successful night?

561
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,966
Time will tell.

562
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:07,884
Hmm.

563
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:11,512
But, yes,
the quest you set in motion is finished.

564
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:12,847
Very good, Archie.

565
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:21,272
No, I want you to keep those.

566
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,068
And the gym.

567
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:26,569
I...

568
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:30,156
appreciate you helping me out
this week, Mr. Lodge.

569
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:31,866
But I don't wanna be in your debt.

570
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,077
It's not a debt, Archie.
It's compensation.

571
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,246
It's a way for me to make amends,
since I was responsible

572
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,500
for launching the Red Paladin quest
in the first place.

573
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,545
Take the keys.

574
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:46,506
Gym's yours.

575
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,925
No strings attached.

576
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:57,475
[Archie] Thank you, Mr. Lodge.

577
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:03,564
[door closes]

578
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:06,776
Hey, can I help?

579
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:10,279
You can start by telling me
what's gotten into you.

580
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:16,160
Are you seriously self-destructing
because I won't make you my partner?

581
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:17,412
Partly.

582
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:20,373
I have an issue
with how I'm being treated by you.

583
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:21,624
Really?

584
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:24,002
I wanna be more than just your errand boy,

585
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:25,712
or pit boss,

586
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:27,714
or casual hookup.

587
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:31,134
I wanna matter, Ronnie.

588
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:32,635
You do matter.

589
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:37,473
And lest we forget,
I just went through a wrenching breakup.

590
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:39,100
Just a few months ago.

591
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,145
So, yeah, I'm taking things slow.

592
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:43,271
Answer me honestly.

593
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,984
Would we even be dating
if not for the speakeasy?

594
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:53,948
Probably not.

595
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,784
But I'm glad we are.

596
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:57,702
Aren't you?

597
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:01,497
I've given up so much for you.

598
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:05,918
I feel like you owe me.
And I'm not getting an ounce in return.

599
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,632
In that case...

600
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,394
I bought your car back from Gladys.

601
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:28,232
Now we don't owe each other anything.

602
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,876
You guys had a hell of a night.

603
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:49,504
It was mainly Archie.
What about you? Find anything?

604
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:53,341
Yeah. It's bad news, Jughead.

605
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:00,848
Hey. Just in time.
I'm making your dad's favorite.

606
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,226
-Fried chicken.
-We need to talk.

607
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:06,854
I hear rumors that you didn't move to town
to get the family back together,

608
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:10,316
but instead to take the drug trade
from Hiram Lodge.

609
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:13,861
You know...

610
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:18,741
I never was one for small-town gossip.

611
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,243
Is it true?

612
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,165
Yeah, it's true.

613
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:27,708
Why?

614
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,169
Why do you think?
I did it for you, your sister.

615
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:31,379
Hell, even your dad.

616
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:35,299
It's about time
the Joneses got a taste of it.

617
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,342
The American Dream.

618
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:38,803
No. You don't get to put this on us.

619
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:41,389
This is criminal. And it's selfish.

620
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,891
Since when is taking care of my family
a selfish act?

621
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,435
Do you even know
where your dad and I come from?

622
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:49,564
Hmm? No one ever handed us anything.

623
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,774
We had to hustle and scam

624
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,901
to make sure there was food on the table

625
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,362
and that you
and Jellybean had a place to sleep.

626
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:59,740
Am I proud of all the crap
that we had to do?

627
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:02,326
No. No.
And you don't even know the half of it.

628
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:06,247
But we did our best, and we survived,

629
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:10,459
and now we're moving to Elm Street,
which is all your father ever wanted.

630
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:13,796
[scoffs] Dad would not be okay,
knowing how you paid for it.

631
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,424
Which is exactly why you won't
say a word to him.

632
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,885
It would break him. Again.

633
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,720
Maybe for the last time.

634
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,473
And I know you don't wanna do that to him.

635
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:38,487
[rock music playing on speakers]

636
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:41,782
Happy birthday, Mr. Jones.

637
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,034
Thank you, Betty.

638
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:46,245
Not too long ago,
you threw one of these for Jughead.

639
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,371
-You remember?
-Ooh.

640
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,415
How could I forget?

641
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:51,209
-Happy birthday, Dad.
-Thanks, son.

642
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,294
[FP groans]

643
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,423
You kids don't go too far.
The good stuff is about to happen.

644
00:36:58,466 --> 00:36:59,300
-Yeah.
-Sure.

645
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:09,185
FP Jones. As I live and breathe.

646
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:14,023
-Happy birthday, brother.
-Thanks, Fred. It's a bit much though.

647
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:17,985
No. You don't get many nights like this,
you gotta soak it up.

648
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,028
[chuckles]

649
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:22,990
I feel like I stumbled into this party and
people are about to ask who let you in.

650
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:26,827
Everybody takes their own path, FP.
Your path has brought you here.

651
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,372
We are gonna be neighbors,
and I'm happy about it.

652
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:30,831
Me, too.

653
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,210
-Thanks for being there.
-Yeah.

654
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:37,964
[sighs]

655
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:47,640
Got your message, Cheryl.
I'm so sorry to hear about Toni.

656
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,560
Oh, Kevin. Are you familiar
with the phrase "que sera sera"?

657
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:54,438
Sure. It means,
"Whatever will be, will be."

658
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,148
Yeah. It's also heavily featured

659
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:58,651
in the iconic
high-school black comedy Heathers.

660
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,945
Did you know
there's a musical version of it?

661
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:03,781
Cheryl, the Farm is co-sponsoring
the musical this year.

662
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:05,241
It's going to be Godspell.

663
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:06,367
Not anymore.

664
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,035
I need to focus my rage.

665
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:11,247
Therefore this year's musical is Heathers.

666
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:12,623
You're directing,

667
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,583
I'm playing HBIC Heather Chandler.

668
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:15,501
Any questions?

669
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,378
I thought not. Okay, bye.

670
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:22,883
[audience clapping]

671
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,302
Thank you, everyone,

672
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:29,015
for coming out
to celebrate one of Riverdale's finest.

673
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,351
-The finest, if you ask me.
-Whoo!

674
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:34,395
My husband, FP Jones.

675
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,147
[clapping]

676
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,400
Once he was a king, a great king.

677
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:41,944
Maybe the best ever.

678
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,947
But I think the greatest role

679
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,157
that he's ever held...

680
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,035
is that of father.

681
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:53,539
So, why don't we ask Jughead
to come on up here and say a few words?

682
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:55,416
-What do you say?
-[man] Yeah.

683
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,626
Do you have any idea
what you're gonna say?

684
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,504
I have no clue.

685
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,715
[crowd] Jug, Jug, Jug,

686
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:04,508
Jug, Jug, Jug.

687
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,427
Jug, Jug, Jug.

688
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,596
[crowd cheering]

689
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,020
Uh...

690
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,022
Thanks, I...

691
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:20,941
wrote...

692
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:36,791
It's no secret that the Jones men
don't really like birthday parties.

693
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,044
We're a rather broody bunch.

694
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:40,961
[crowd chuckles]

695
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,883
I remember when you made me promise
not to stop writing. Not for anything.

696
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,385
And I haven't.

697
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:49,970
I've written every day.

698
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:53,307
But I could punch keys every night
in a booth at Pop's,

699
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:57,186
and never come up with a story
nearly as remarkable as yours.

700
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,939
You've gone
from the wrong side of the tracks

701
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:01,816
to the right side of the law.

702
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:05,361
From Serpent King to Sheriff of Riverdale.

703
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:07,863
From a man
that most people in this town...

704
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:10,366
had probably written off...

705
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:14,662
to someone that righted his wrongs...

706
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,749
and brought our family back together.

707
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:22,128
That's who you are to me.

708
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,715
Someone that would do anything
for his family.

709
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:39,103
There's something you need to know
about this family.

710
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,361
We'll always be there for you.

711
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:48,904
Me...

712
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:51,157
Jellybean, and Mom.

713
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,369
I'm proud to be your son.

714
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,039
I'm proud to share your name.

715
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,127
And I am proud...

716
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:05,546
to be part of your...

717
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:08,174
amazing story.

718
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:12,344
Here's to 50, Dad.

719
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,140
And to 50 more.

720
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:17,308
[all cheering]

721
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,244
That was a beautiful speech, Jug.

722
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:38,913
Thanks.

723
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:40,664
Most of it was true.

724
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:44,543
[Betty sighs]

725
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:46,003
What are you gonna do now?

726
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:51,842
Save Jellybean, protect my dad,
and run my mom out of town.

727
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,011
Do you wanna help?
