[NARRATOR]
<i>Previously on </i>Riverdale:

2
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:11,929
[JUGHEAD] Hiram's gonna follow
you or us, wherever we go.

3
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,347
Where is he?

4
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:16,934
- I've heard of this game before.
- It's an urban legend.

5
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,560
We definitely have to play it.

6
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:20,687
[ALICE] We dubbed ourselves
the Midnight Club.

7
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:22,606
[PENELOPE] Welcome to
the Ascension Party.

8
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:23,982
What about these drugs?

9
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:27,444
- I don't know how they get them.
- A Serpent dealer. Fangs Fogarty.

10
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:29,613
Go undercover. Join the Gargoyle Gang.

11
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,115
Need a man inside Hiram Lodge's
drug operations

12
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:34,117
- to take him down.
- [ARCHIE] Your dad's out there.

13
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:37,538
If we're together, he'll hunt me down.
Everyone close to me is his target.

14
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,706
If you loved me, you would come home.

15
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,042
[ARCHIE]
If I ever wanna go back to Riverdale,

16
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,378
I have to destroy
that part of me that's weak.

17
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,337
[BEAR ROARS]

18
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,673
I was attacked by a grizzly.
I'm in bad shape.

19
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:50,175
[WOMAN] Come on. Wake up, kid.

20
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:57,015
[JUGHEAD]<i> At 8:47 on
a Wednesday morning,</i>

21
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:58,392
<i>Archie Andrews died.</i>

22
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,860
<i>At least, the Archie we knew.</i>

23
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:13,323
<i>What returned to Riverdale
was something far different</i>

24
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,158
<i>from the redheaded boy next door.</i>

25
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,287
<i>He was now a stranger,</i>

26
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,998
<i>with dark hair and scars...</i>

27
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,458
<i>both inside and out.</i>

28
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:28,964
What, Vegas?

29
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:32,384
Archie.

30
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:35,596
Hey, Dad.

31
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:38,932
[GROANS]

32
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:40,601
What? What's wrong, son?

33
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,144
It's a long story.

34
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,398
I don't remember the rangers finding me.

35
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:50,611
Then I woke up in the hospital,
knowing that... I couldn't keep running.

36
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:54,906
It was time to come home, back to
a normal life, if that's possible.

37
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:56,783
What about Hiram?

38
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,411
[CHUCKLES] I survived
a bear attack, Dad.

39
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:03,624
I can't live my life in fear
of when he might come after me anymore.

40
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,753
I'm more worried
about him gunning for you.

41
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,464
I survived the Black Hood.

42
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:11,882
Twice.

43
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:13,675
Hiram doesn't scare me.

44
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,928
He's not the only one in this town
with friends.

45
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:20,265
What about Veronica?
You reach out to her?

46
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,441
[ARCHIE] Veronica?

47
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,153
Archie?

48
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:47,668
What are you doing here?
Where have you been?

49
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:49,753
- Why haven't you called me?
- I wanted to.

50
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:51,963
Every day. But after the last call...

51
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,257
What the hell happened to your hair?

52
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:58,845
I dyed it,
so I wouldn't get recognized, in case...

53
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,015
your father came looking for me.

54
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:03,642
Right.

55
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,448
Veronica, I'm sorry.

56
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:24,371
If you don't wanna ever talk to me
again, I completely understand that.

57
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:27,290
Don't be crazy, Archie.

58
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,459
I'm just so happy that you're home.

59
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,380
And safe.

60
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:52,607
[POP] Two chocolates, one vanilla,
and a root beer float for Archie.

61
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,609
- Welcome home.
- Thanks, Pop.

62
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,238
Since when do you
drink root beer floats?

63
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,574
I'm just not in the
mood for a milkshake.

64
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,536
New drink, new hair...

65
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,122
new haunted, vacant look in your eyes.

66
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:11,460
Guys, Archie lived through<i> The Revenant.</i>
Let him order what he wants.

67
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:15,213
So, what'd I miss while I was gone?

68
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:20,886
Well, thanks to the town quarantine
orchestrated by my father,

69
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,221
Pop's was shut down, and just reopened.

70
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,099
He's also been attacking shipments
to the speakeasy.

71
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:29,060
But I've hired the Serpents
as my full-time protection,

72
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:31,605
and that service extends to you, Archie.

73
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,149
Don't worry about Hiram's goons
coming after you or your dad.

74
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,818
You won't see them,
but I have guys watching you.

75
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:40,447
I have a possible lead that could
diffuse this threat permanently.

76
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:42,574
What, Jug?

77
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,037
You can't tell anyone.

78
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,499
Fangs is deep undercover
in the Gargoyle Gang.

79
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:52,667
Hasn't met the King. He's working on it.

80
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,753
When we get access, we'll take him down.

81
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,506
My bet is it's Hiram
underneath the mask.

82
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:00,884
- Sorry, Veronica.
- Don't be.

83
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:04,971
- I wouldn't put it past him.
- Well, there goes studying for the SATs.

84
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:07,015
What?

85
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:08,391
SATs?

86
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,018
Yeah, they're this Saturday.

87
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,482
Don't worry.
I will help you study and catch up.

88
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:16,483
Okay? We all will.

89
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,734
[SIGHS]

90
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,822
I'm sorry, Betty,
but your debit card was declined.

91
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,866
I got you, Bee.
Just put it on my tab, Pop.

92
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,955
This is a new low. I was on the phone
with the Bank of Riverdale,

93
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,708
who told me that all of my accounts,
including my college fund,

94
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,752
have been completely drained of assets.

95
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,879
Not drained, just transferred.

96
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,631
Most of it was blood money

97
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,716
- you inherited from the Blossoms.
- Okay.

98
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,553
Tell me where that money went.

99
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:49,516
It was wired to the Farm,
as a tax-deductible donation.

100
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,893
You gave my money to the Farm?

101
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:55,105
To help support the children
you liberated from the Sisters.

102
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,440
- You just gave away my tuition money.
- Or...

103
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:00,360
of course, you could always study
at the Farm for free.

104
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,070
Mom, I swear to God,

105
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:05,615
you are not cornering me
into joining your cult.

106
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,121
[HIRAM] Fred Andrews.

107
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,331
FP Jones.

108
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:15,584
What can I do for you fellas?

109
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:19,379
Came to let you know
that my son is home permanently.

110
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,881
He is?

111
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,968
- That's just great, Fred.
- [FP] Cut the crap, Hiram.

112
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:28,346
- We all know you have it out for his kid.
- I'll stop you there.

113
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:30,390
I've never wished any harm to...

114
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,560
either of your sons.

115
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:40,567
Hiram, if you harm a hair
on Archie's head, I will kill you.

116
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:43,695
Make no mistake about it.
And I'll be at peace

117
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,781
with whatever the consequences
of that are.

118
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:02,213
As you transition back into your life
at Riverdale High,

119
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:06,676
I would advise you to be realistic
in terms of your goals.

120
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,219
I am, Mr. Weatherbee.

121
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,349
I just wanna get caught up,
and I wanna be a normal student again.

122
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,351
The SATs are this coming Saturday.

123
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:18,730
I'm guessing you haven't really had
a chance to adequately prepare?

124
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,398
Not yet, sir.

125
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,402
Mr. Andrews, given your situation,

126
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:25,946
I would strongly recommend...

127
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:28,990
that you repeat your junior year.

128
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,789
And not graduate with my friends?

129
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,041
In the long term...

130
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,252
I believe it would be best for you.

131
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:57,686
Everything all right?

132
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,980
- You didn't text me back last night.
- Reggie.

133
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:01,356
Cool it.

134
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:03,817
Archie's back.

135
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:07,988
- Archie's back? Since when?
- Look.

136
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,698
I know we were...

137
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:14,244
But I can't tell Archie
that one of his best friends

138
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,205
and his ex-girlfriend got together
while he was away, so,

139
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,416
- you and I, this has to...
- No, I get it.

140
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,084
Archie's back.

141
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:23,837
'Nuff said.

142
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,798
How's he doing?

143
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,591
He's feeling...

144
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,594
unsettled,

145
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,304
and stressed.

146
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:36,057
I can't do anything about the former,

147
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,768
but I definitely can about the latter.

148
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:43,023
With something that'll help all of us
blow off some steam.

149
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,275
[BETTY] <i>She can't do this, can she?</i>

150
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:49,320
She can as long as both
of your parents signed off

151
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:50,572
to release your funds.

152
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:55,535
And from these, it looks like...
your father did sign.

153
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,079
No, that's impossible.
She never goes to see him.

154
00:08:58,455 --> 00:08:59,581
Is this his signature?

155
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,500
No. That's a forgery.

156
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,837
And I know because I, myself,
have forged it in the past.

157
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,007
As part of an investigation.

158
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:12,552
Well, you need to get your real father
to sign an affidavit,

159
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:16,306
attesting to the fact that he never
agreed to liquidate your funds.

160
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,349
Then we can pursue legal action.

161
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,268
Which means...

162
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,563
I have to see my dad.

163
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,859
I'm sure you've heard, Hiram,

164
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,570
the Sisters of Quiet Mercy estate
is up for auction.

165
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,698
Appears to be a competitive situation
with multiple bidders,

166
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:36,701
including the Farm,
coming in with strong offers.

167
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,828
I have other plans for that property.

168
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,288
For my brothel?

169
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,750
The Sisters will not be turned
into a brothel, Madame Blossom.

170
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,461
So, then why did you summon us here,
Hiram?

171
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,213
Because we need a new sheriff.

172
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,549
Someone who'll allow
our various enterprises

173
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,802
