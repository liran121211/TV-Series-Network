1
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:11,636
-[narrator] <i>Previously on </i>Riverdale:
-Thank you for agreeing to help me.

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,722
If I could go undercover, I would.

3
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:16,474
Have you ever experienced the loss
of a loved one?

4
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:17,392
My brother Jason.

5
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:19,519
[Edgar] Memories are often painful.

6
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:20,645
They don't have to be.

7
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,063
[Cheryl] I'm done being your mole.

8
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:25,025
You should stop going to the Farm
before Edgar catches onto you.

9
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,151
I'm still going to go.

10
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:29,529
Is the reason you're so obsessed
with the Farm

11
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:31,281
because they let you talk to Charles?

12
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:32,949
Yes, I see my son.

13
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,285
[Edgar] Tell me, what do you want to know?

14
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:37,746
Everything. Start from the beginning.

15
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,497
Ricky. You don't wanna do this.

16
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:42,292
If I don't do this, the Gargoyles,
they won't protect me.

17
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,002
[Archie] Jug, Mad Dog was right.

18
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:46,379
I saw Gargoyles coming in and out,
like they own the place.

19
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,590
[Jughead]
Must be where Kurtz is doing his cooking.

20
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:50,884
I'm ready to ascend. Are you?
Elio hooked me up with a house
on the Northside.

21
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:59,142
-So, what, you have to fight for him?
-Come on, you saw that place.

22
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,729
[FP] Terry, I'm getting close
to the clearing. I don't see any--

23
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:12,030
Poor Baby Teeth.

24
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:15,325
Brandon Morris was his real name.
We ID'd him from his prints.

25
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:19,454
First glance, very similar
to how you found Ben and Dilton,

26
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:21,498
but I don't know.

27
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,918
I need your help, son. Please.

28
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:27,670
Yeah, of course.

29
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:33,093
His blue lips are the same.

30
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,804
Markings on his back are the same, too.

31
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:42,811
But his missing teeth, that's the twist.

32
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,066
[sighs]

33
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,984
This might be a copycat killer.

34
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:52,278
It could be the same guy
that went after Ben and Dilton,

35
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,114
but they were willing participants.

36
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,032
Baby Teeth struggled.

37
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,785
Maybe the brutality
of his death was the message.

38
00:01:58,868 --> 00:01:59,702
Like a warning.

39
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:00,787
That he's back,

40
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,330
and he's angry.

41
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,208
-The Gargoyle King.
-The real one.

42
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,634
You already know who I am, Betty.

43
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:17,137
No. I don't have a clue.

44
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,347
I've done a deep dive on the Internet,

45
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,100
and there's no record
of anyone named Edgar Evernever.

46
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,148
Many years ago...

47
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,568
I was a very different man.

48
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:35,238
My life was in tatters.

49
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,949
So, I left it behind...

50
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,827
and I walked in the desert to die.

51
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:45,540
Until I stumbled upon a tree
on a hill beside a farm.

52
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:46,958
I was in death's clutches.

53
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:51,588
And somehow,
I stumbled to the door of that farm,

54
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:52,505
and I knocked.

55
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,343
When I awoke, I was in a white room.

56
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,805
I was being tended to
by a kind, elderly farmer.

57
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,640
I asked her, "How can I repay you?"

58
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,685
So, she put me to work on her farm.

59
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,063
I plowed those fields,
and I sowed them with seed,

60
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:13,318
and I watched them grow
into something beautiful.

61
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,653
I felt reborn.

62
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:19,324
After that, I made it my sacred duty

63
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:20,533
to open my own farm...

64
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,705
where I could welcome lost souls
wandering out in the darkness.

65
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,499
It's a nice story,

66
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,543
but it doesn't explain

67
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:33,755
how you've convinced my mom
that she can see her dead son.

68
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:38,968
Here, we strive to create a safe place,

69
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,639
where wounded people can heal,

70
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,808
and become the best versions
of themselves.

71
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:52,106
But first, they must open themselves
to that process.

72
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:01,199
No, but really,
how does my mom see her dead son?

73
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,077
Do you have someone dress up like Charles?

74
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:12,752
All right, boys, bring it in.

75
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,840
-Know you're all pissed about Baby Teeth.
-Damn right.

76
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,593
And his killer will be caught.
I swear to you.

77
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:21,803
But in the meantime...

78
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,555
we honor our fallen brother.

79
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,807
How the hell do we do that?

80
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,394
I'm dedicating my next match
to Baby Teeth.

81
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,313
No one asked you, Mad Dog.

82
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,606
Why are you even here?

83
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,233
Because Baby Teeth was my brother, too.

84
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:39,529
Wait, Mad Dog, what match?
Did Elio already hook you up with one?

85
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,448
There's a boxing tournament this weekend,
called the Gilded Gloves.

86
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,033
I was gonna fight to win.

87
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,120
But now I'm gonna fight to win
and honor Baby Teeth.

88
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,875
[Veronica] <i>How's your boxing career</i>
<i>these days, Archie?</i>

89
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,796
Your pal Elio is organizing
a boxing event called the Gilded Gloves.

90
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,632
Brawny young men,
shirtless and in shorts. Go on.

91
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,551
[Archie] I was thinking, maybe you could

92
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,137
help get the El Royale Crew a spot
in the tournament.

93
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,097
The guys could use a win,
or at least a boost,

94
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,598
after what happened to Baby Teeth.

95
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:09,600
Let me see what I can do.

96
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,188
Good morning, my dear Riverdale High
constituents and comrades.

97
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:17,734
A lot of you have been asking
about the Farm's student advocacy group.

98
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,485
Well, here's the skinny.

99
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,656
<i>Signup sheets are posted</i>
<i>throughout the school.</i>

100
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,700
<i>The club is open to all students.</i>

101
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:28,786
<i>Where the one become many,</i>
<i>and the many become one.</i>

102
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,541
<i>So, uncap those pens,</i>
<i>sharpen those pencils, and sign up.</i>

103
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:36,461
<i>A little birdie told me,</i>
<i>it's what all the cool kids are doing.</i>

104
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,758
<i>Invasion of the Body Snatchers </i>continues.

105
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,384
So, let me get this straight.

106
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,928
The reason Cheryl is all-in on the Farm

107
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:50,308
is that she gets to see and talk to Jason?

108
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,225
Yeah.

109
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:55,313
My mom's entirely convinced
that she's seeing and talking to Charles.

110
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:56,522
Her long-lost son.

111
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,026
What if you prove that Charles was dead?

112
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,487
Your mom has lost touch with reality,

113
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,281
so, maybe the best way
to snap her out of her delusions

114
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,908
is with a harsh dose of truth.

115
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,785
Like proof that Charles is dead.

116
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:12,497
Anything that'll refute these fantasies
that Edgar Evernever is spinning.

117
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:18,711
[Betty] No. Unfortunately,
I only have a name. Charles Smith.

118
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,672
He was raised
in the Sisters of Quiet Mercy,

119
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,716
but they turned him out when he was 18.

120
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,931
Well, I appreciate you trying.

121
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:38,481
Betty, whatever the Farm did with Cheryl,
I'm holding you responsible.

122
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,359
How did my girlfriend become
Queen of the Farmies overnight?

123
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:42,443
It's Edgar.

124
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,071
He is a con artist.

125
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:48,116
He's somehow convinced my mom
and Cheryl...

126
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,245
[sighs] that they can...

127
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,872
talk to the dead.

128
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,125
Excuse me?

129
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:02,964
Cheryl thinks she's been talking to Jason.
She says she sees him.

130
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,173
But Jason's dead.

131
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,260
Everybody knows that Jason's dead.

132
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:09,303
True.

133
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,142
And there's proof that Jason's dead,
that he was murdered.

134
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,686
What are you talking about?

135
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:20,231
[sighs]

136
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:26,571
I'm gonna send you a video, Toni, of...

137
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,492
Clifford Blossom shooting Jason.

138
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:34,412
I kept a copy of it on my laptop.

139
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,414
Show it to Cheryl,

140
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,624
and hopefully it will be enough

141
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,169
to snap her back into reality.

142
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,212
[cell phone buzzing]

143
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:46,424
Oh, hold on. Will you give me a second?
I think this is my dad.

144
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,092
Hello?

145
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,562
[Elio] Veronica Lodge,

146
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:02,356
I don't suppose I need to tell you,
this is a men's steam room.

147
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,066
I came to talk business.

148
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,905
I wanna get in on the Gilded Gloves.

149
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,490
You don't know a thing about boxing.

150
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,491
[chuckles]

151
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,326
You'd be surprised by what I know

152
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:17,079
about hot, shirtless, muscular bruisers.

153
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,415
Starting with Archie Andrews.

154
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,042
If memory serves,

155
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:24,003
he almost beat your prizefighter,
Randy Ronson.

156
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:26,631
Archie's a bum.
And bums have no place in my tournament.

157
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,425
Now get the hell out of my steam room.

158
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:32,261
Fine.

159
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,723
But remember this.

160
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,393
Remember I tried to keep things civil.

161
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,569
[Curdle Jr.]
He suffered a myriad of traumas.

162
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:52,365
But our good friend here died
from loss of blood.

163
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,909
From the pulling of his teeth,

164
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:57,662
which occurred premortem.

165
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:02,833
There's one more ghoulish detail
I discovered during the autopsy.

166
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:06,796
There was something lodged in his throat.

167
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:09,757
What the hell is that?

168
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,386
[Jughead] A matchbook from the Maple Club.

169
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,097
I thought I'd seen the true face of evil.

170
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:17,848
But this...

171
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:20,518
Whoever did this...

172
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,728
isn't even human.

173
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:34,198
Any idea how one of your matchbooks
ended up in Baby Teeth's throat?

174
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:39,120
Well, they are complimentary
to all of our guests.

175
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,789
We don't recommend they ingest them.

176
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:46,460
I do recall this young man being here
a few nights ago.

177
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,629
He was here with some friends.

178
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,548
Ex-cons, but charming.

179
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:55,344
Anyway, this "Baby Teeth"
left the Maple Club

180
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,346
with a grin on his face,

181
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,389
and alive.

182
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:03,352
My girl Rosemary fulfilled his fantasy.

183
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,062
[glass breaking and women screaming]

184
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,606
What on Eve's earth?

185
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,946
[man growling]

186
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,292
All right, okay.

187
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:28,711
Hey.

188
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,465
I got him cuffed in the back
of my cruiser.

189
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,300
He's not going anywhere.

190
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:38,095
Anything else you can tell us about him?
Like his name, or where he's from?

191
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,851
Martin, but they all use an alias.

192
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,478
Did something seem different about him?

193
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:46,395
Yes.

194
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:50,983
Martin likes to take Fizzle Rocks
to enhance the experience.

195
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,401
But this was different.

196
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,861
The high hit him like a truck,

197
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:56,322
he started foaming at the mouth,
freaking out.

198
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:57,406
This was helpful.

199
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,534
If anything else comes up,
please, give me a call.

200
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:07,792
[Alice] <i>And we're live in three, two, one.</i>

201
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,752
This is Alice Smith,

202
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,629
and I'm here with Veronica Lodge,

203
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:14,632
promoter of the Southside's
El Royale Boxing Club.
Veronica, would you like to tell us
about your latest business venture?

204
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:20,805
<i>Our athletic facility will help you</i>
<i>reach your fitness goals</i>

205
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,808
<i>in a fun, classic,</i>
<i>competitive environment.</i>

206
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:27,353
<i>Our trained staff features some</i>
<i>of the toughest fighters in the state,</i>

207
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:30,981
<i>including up-and-coming boxer</i>
<i>Archie Andrews.</i>

208
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:31,899
<i>Archie?</i>

209
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,610
[Archie] Hi, I'm Archie Andrews,

210
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,530
owner, trainer, and fighter,
here at the El Royale Boxing Club.

211
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:40,741
Join now, and your first three
personal training sessions with me

212
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,451
are completely free.

213
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,915
I got one more thing to say.
A message for Randy Ronson.

214
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:50,876
<i>This Friday night at the Gilded Gloves,</i>
<i>I want my rematch.</i>

215
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:52,336
<i>Me and you.</i>

216
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,547
<i>Let's settle this for good.</i>

217
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:58,008
<i>Strong words from a local hero.</i>

218
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:02,513
<i>Live from the Southside,</i>
<i>I'm Alice Smith, RIVW.</i>

219
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,726
[Hal]
<i>Your mother has thrown down the gauntlet.</i>

220
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,853
She's filed for divorce.

221
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:12,773
Her lawyers issued the papers today,
but I haven't signed yet.

222
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,192
Has she started seeing someone?

223
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,487
Well, she does spend most of her time
at the Farm,

224
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,114
presumably with Edgar,

225
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,449
who's a con artist.

226
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:24,452
He's got her thinking
she's seeing Charles.

227
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,203
That's impossible. Charles is dead.

228
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,080
Yeah,
but I don't have physical proof of that.

229
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,166
I don't have a body, I don't have ashes.

230
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,755
You know,
you don't need a body or ashes, Betty.

231
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:37,798
Just a stone.

232
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,177
A piece of granite will do.

233
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,348
[Elio] <i>I must admit, that was a bold move,</i>
<i>challenging Randy.</i>

234
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:50,561
So, does this mean the El Royale boxers
will get to be part of the Gilded Gloves?

235
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:51,479
Yes.

236
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:54,231
Only thing is, your boy is gonna have
to move up a weight class.

237
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,233
Randy's fighting
in the middleweight division now.

238
00:12:58,652 --> 00:12:59,487
Fine.

239
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,404
Great.

240
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,740
-I'm hosting at my gym.
-[chuckles]

241
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:03,657
Nice try.

242
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,242
We'll flip for the venue.

243
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,955
Heads for Archie's gym,
tails for your gym.

244
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,588
Heads.

245
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,548
We'll see you at the El Royale.

246
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:25,429
[FP] <i>When he finally comes down, we'll</i>
<i>ask him where he got the Fizzle Rocks.</i>

247
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:26,889
My bet is still Kurtz.

248
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:30,184
Wouldn't mind asking him if he knows
anything about Baby Teeth either.

249
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:33,521
I'll have forensics run a test
on the Fizzle Rocks he had on him.

250
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,902
[Cheryl] <i>Why would you show this to me?</i>

251
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:43,155
[Toni] Because you needed
to be reminded of the truth.

252
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:46,242
Cheryl, you're not talking to Jason
at the Farm.

253
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,577
The truth is all right there,
in this video.

254
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:53,123
Toni, this video is clearly fabricated.

255
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,418
With technology these days,
anything is possible.

256
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,129
Detractors can spin any story they want.

257
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:02,633
Cheryl, have...

258
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:07,346
you ever hugged Jason?

259
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,392
Yes. Of course.

260
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,478
Now enough of this third degree.

261
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:24,864
Betty?

262
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:27,741
Mom...

263
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,995
are you engaged to Edgar?

264
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:32,288
[sighs]

265
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:37,084
Edgar and I have a deep understanding
of one another.

266
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,129
That's what I thought.

267
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,841
I wanna show you something.

268
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,472
What is this, Betty?

269
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:57,688
I paid someone
to help me track down Charles' grave.

270
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,440
I'm so sorry, Mom,

271
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:02,109
but you haven't been talking to him
at the Farm.

272
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:03,652
Your son...

273
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:09,783
has been here, dead and buried,
for the last five years.

274
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,376
[sighs]

275
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,086
It's just so sad.

276
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:24,590
I know, Mom.

277
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:29,929
So sad that you won't let me be happy
at the Farm.

278
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,725
I don't know
when you're gonna give up, Betty.

279
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,523
You saw his gravestone.

280
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,691
I'm sorry, Betty.

281
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,236
But I spoke to my son this morning.

282
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:52,576
[breathing heavily]

283
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,292
I'm sorry, too, Mom.

284
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:02,711
[Alice gasps]

285
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:13,597
Bon appétit, champ.

286
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,433
You're making up for lost calories.

287
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,562
-Ronnie, I feel like Jughead.
-That's the idea, Archie.

288
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,484
[man] <i>Randy Ronson, to the scale.</i>

289
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,448
One hundred and fifty-nine pounds.

290
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,908
-[crowd cheering]
-Yeah.

291
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,248
Archie Andrews, to the scale.

292
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,637
One hundred and fifty-four pounds.

293
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:54,930
[crowd cheering]

294
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,994
Where am I? What did you do to me?

295
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:18,704
I chloroformed you.

296
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,832
Don't worry, Mom. You're safe.

297
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,883
Edgar always starts with questions,

298
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,885
so, I'll do the same.

299
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,262
Do you remember this?

300
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,057
It was your first day
at <i>The Riverdale Register.</i>

301
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,308
You were so excited.

302
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:43,270
And now I'm an on-air reporter for RIVW,
thanks to the Farm.

303
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,274
Eighth grade graduation.

304
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,695
You cried that day. Do you remember?

305
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:52,905
That's the past.

306
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:55,949
I'm someone else now.

307
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,409
No. No.

308
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:58,744
The past is...

309
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,497
part of who you are.

310
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,207
You're Alice Cooper.

311
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,502
You bought a house on Elm Street.
You painted our front door red.

312
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,545
I lived with a murderer in that house.

313
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:11,131
You raised me and Polly in it, too.

314
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,176
Bad things happen,
but you can't get rid of your past,

315
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,553
because then you'd lose
the good parts, too.

316
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,307
There's been so much pain.

317
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,935
I know, I know, but...
that's what makes us stronger.

318
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,189
Edgar doesn't see that.

319
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,774
You have to believe me.

320
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,193
Believe you?

321
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,697
Okay. So, tell me the truth, Betty.

322
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,909
Was that really Charles' grave?

323
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,377
So, how can I trust you? You lied to me.

324
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,796
You faked a gravestone.

325
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:54,258
Look, I love you. I love you, Betty.

326
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,846
But you're gonna have to let me go.

327
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,268
I'm sorry, Mom.

328
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:06,937
No...

329
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,774
I have to go to school, but, um,
I'll come back to check on you.

330
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:11,900
No, Betty.

331
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,988
This is your life.

332
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:16,947
Look at it.

333
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,450
And remember who you are.

334
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:25,706
Hey...

335
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:35,299
[Jughead] <i>You locked your mom</i>
<i>in Dilton's bunker?</i>

336
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:41,680
Yeah, it's the only place
where she'll be safe from the Farm, Jug.

337
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:44,766
And I've already made some headway
with the deprogramming.

338
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,602
Next I'm gonna listen
to her testimony tapes,

339
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,229
and see if there's anything I can use
to help me get my mom back.

340
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,647
[banging noise nearby]

341
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:52,441
What is that?

342
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,617
What the hell is going on?

343
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,703
Hey, did she take something?

344
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,747
Yeah. She took some G.
Get her to the infirmary.

345
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,588
[cell phone buzzes]
Hey, Dad.

346
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:18,175
Jug, I need your brain, boy.

347
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,970
I got another guy here on a nasty trip.

-It's for luck.

525
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,116
[both chuckle]

526
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,455
I'm pretty sure they're your size.
[giggling]

527
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,790
Thank you, Ronnie.
Thank you for believing in me.

528
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,419
No matter what happens...
I want you to know that...

529
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,591
I'm always in your corner.

530
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,727
-I should go. Still lots to do.
-Yup.

531
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,562
[sighs]

532
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,439
-Okay.
-Okay. Bye.

533
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:22,357
See you later.

534
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,487
[door opens then closes]

535
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:32,367
Flying a little close to the sun there,
aren't you?

536
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:35,036
We're friends now, Dad.

537
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,080
Uh-huh. Yeah.

538
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:38,289
Friends.

539
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:47,048
[school bell ringing]

540
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,142
Tee-Tee.
Are you okay?

541
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,023
[sighs] Evelyn said...

542
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,526
I have to make a choice.

543
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:09,237
Jason...

544
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:11,447
or you.

545
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,660
Cheryl, Jason's a ghost.

546
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:18,496
I'm right here.

547
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,749
You love me.

548
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,337
[sobbing] I'm sorry, Toni.

549
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,131
I do love you.

550
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,219
But I've loved Jason my whole life.

551
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:35,221
Cheryl...

552
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,306
I'm not gonna let this happen.

553
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,226
There has to be a way
you can be with me...

554
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:43,396
and Jason.

555
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:46,566
[sighs]

556
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:48,151
There is.

557
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,571
If you're willing to open your mind to it.

558
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:53,072
[rock music playing]

559
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,680
[Alice] <i>Betty won't admit it,</i>
<i>but I know she was deeply hurt by Hal.</i>

560
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:20,683
<i>We all were, but she took it the hardest.</i>

561
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,980
-How'd it go?
-Great.

562
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:28,024
No one suspects anything.

563
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:34,906
Toni...

564
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,828
I'm not a monster...

565
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:44,457
-am I?
-No.

566
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:49,670
You're a daughter
who wants her mother back.

567
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:53,716
Just like I want my girlfriend back.

568
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:12,693
-There he is, Kurtz.
-Where?

569
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,029
[Jughead] In the hoodie.
He's walking towards the alley.

570
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:25,832
[police siren wailing]

571
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,296
-[Jughead] Hold it.
-[FP] Put your hands up.

572
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:33,965
Don't you move.

573
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:35,550
Get them up.

574
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,560
You and your drugs
are done for good, Kurtz.

575
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:47,728
Get up.

576
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:56,779
[crowd cheering]

577
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:07,665
[Josie] Are you nervous?

578
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,417
Not a bit.

579
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,128
[Josie] Is that a new robe?

580
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:13,212
And trunks.

581
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:16,924
Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe is Archie's
official sponsor.<i> </i>You like them?

582
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:24,015
I'm gonna end Andrews tonight. I got this.

583
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:27,018
You said that last time,
and he almost beat you.

584
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:32,315
-What the hell's in that?
-Little last-minute boost.

585
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:33,900
Dissolved some G into your water.

586
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:37,069
Now...

587
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:40,489
get in there and live up to your promise.

588
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,550
[opera music playing on speakers]

589
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,141
I'll admit, Betty,

590
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,894
I'm surprised you've asked me
to sign these divorce papers.

591
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,481
Well, that makes two of us.

592
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,066
[clears throat]

593
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,529
Why the change of heart?

594
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:27,912
I finally realized
that it's time to let Mom go.

595
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:33,000
She needs to heal
in whatever way she chooses.

596
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:37,296
Mm.

597
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,259
I wonder, Betty, if you would consider

598
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,052
doing me a favor, as well.

599
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:46,681
What kind of favor?

600
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:49,016
Oh, it's nothing much.

601
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:54,772
I just wanna come home.

602
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:03,739
Good boy, Arch. Stick and move.

603
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,260
Kid, get the hell out of there.

604
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:28,431
[bell rings]

605
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,433
[bell ringing]

606
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:37,648
You better stay off the ropes, kid.

607
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,152
Something's wrong.

608
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:45,656
Ronson's on some kind of crazy drug.
The ref needs to call the fight.

609
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:52,371
Hey, ref. Ronson looks like he wants
to chew off my fighter's face.

610
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:53,914
We want a disqualification.

611
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,125
Only way this match ends
is if you forfeit.

612
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,418
You wanna take the loss?

613
00:38:58,753 --> 00:38:59,962
Screw you, Elio.

614
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:03,257
He's gonna have himself
a hell of a hangover,

615
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,593
but I need you to knock him out
in this round.

616
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,970
I don't know. I don't know.

617
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,889
The overhand right is there for you.

618
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:13,434
Once you see a crack in his armor,
you bring out the hacksaw, you understand?

619
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,353
-[ref] Seconds out.
-[bell rings]

620
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:16,771
Let's do it.

621

[bell rings]

622
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,092
[Mr. Keller] Good boy, Arch.

623
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,267
-Attaboy.
-[ref] One. Two.

624
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:58,187
Three. Four. Five.

625
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:02,108
-Six. Seven. Eight. Nine.
-[crowd] <i>Archie. Archie. Archie...</i>

626
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:03,692
Ten. It's over.

627
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:04,693
[bell rings]
Whoo!

628
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:15,579
Ronson.

629
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:17,832
We need a doctor.
Somebody call a doctor.

630
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,919
Ronson, wake up.

631
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:26,090
[FP] You hurt a lot of people, Kurtz.
What were you thinking?

632
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:29,635
Sell the bad batch, get out of town,
dodge a murder charge?

633
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,059
Why Baby Teeth?

634
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:39,019
Did the Gargoyle King demand a sacrifice?

635
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:41,814
Baby Teeth.

636
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:45,359
He was only the warm-up.

637
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,362
To what?

638
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,489
To the ultimate quest.

639
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:53,033
To one final game...

640
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:54,785
for you...

641
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:57,455
and your family...

642
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,748
Hellcaster.

643
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,501
It was demanded by the King.
Save the Little Princess.

644
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:11,969
Jellybean?

645
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:14,180
What the hell did you do? What did you do?

646
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:16,599
She's been summoned...

647
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:18,726
by the King.

648
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,269
[laughing]

649
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,068
I don't understand.

650
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,029
Why couldn't we just keep playing
in Pop's?

651
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,614
Because, Princess Jellybean...

652
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:33,574
he wanted to meet you.

653
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:35,075
Who did?
