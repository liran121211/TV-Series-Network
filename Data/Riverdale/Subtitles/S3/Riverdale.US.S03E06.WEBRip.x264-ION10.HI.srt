00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:09,926
[narrator] <i>Previously on</i> Riverdale:

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,303
How did Hiram Lodge pin
Cassidy Bullock's murder on me?

3
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:16,099
[Norton] He paid Mr. Bullock's friends
to say that they saw you pull the trigger.

4
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:17,942
It's my understanding
that they're in hiding.

5
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,978
I'd hide in the mines by Shadow Lake.

6
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:22,480
The warden said if I
did this, I'd ascend.

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,400
[Jughead]
You're breaking Archie out of juvie?

8
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:27,799
[Veronica] We'll need a distraction
to disorient the guards

9
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:30,488
- and hide Archie's play for the grate.
- [Norton] Find him!

10
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,824
Right now!

11
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:35,201
Joaquin? Where are you going?
Back to the Serpents?

12
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,058
- No, I joined a different gang.
- Game Master.

13
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:38,913
- Where is the Red Paladin?
- The Red Paladin?

14
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:41,708
[Veronica]
Everyone in this room is part of a pact.

15
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,377
No one knows of Archie's whereabouts,
capisce?

16
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,796
[Archie] Does Hiram Lodge own you, too?

17
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,923
[Norton] My soul belongs
to no mere mortal.

18
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:51,676
He's watching us. He's always watching.

19
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,140
[Betty] Oh, Archie.

20
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:00,769
What does it mean?

21
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,831
How are we gonna get out of this mess?

22
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:25,919
[Jughead] Betty.

23
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:27,879
I saw him.

24
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:29,631
The Gargoyle King.

25
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:33,676
Jug. What the hell? Just now?

26
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,846
Yeah. As I was walking home.
I followed him into a clearing.

27
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,891
<i>Betty, there were others.
There's like ten of them.</i>

28
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:42,727
<i>They looked like his disciples.
Like they were worshiping the king.</i>

29
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:44,729
- Oh, my God.
- They had on these masks.

30
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,398
Like they were a gang.
A gang of gargoyles.

31
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,589
- Let's go after them.
- No. We shouldn't push our luck.

32
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,986
- Not until we know more.
- Who could they be?

33
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:53,822
[Archie] Joaquin.

34
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:04,582
Joaquin told Kevin about a new gang.

35
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,919
And then Joaquin ran into the woods.

36
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:12,090
We know Warden Norton
is playing G&G.

37
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:14,384
And Joaquin was doing his dirty work.

38
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:18,847
Another piece of damning evidence that
Warden Norton could be our Gargoyle King.

39
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,015
[Betty sighs]

40
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,643
[police sirens wailing]

41
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,321
Where have you been, young lady?

42
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,241
There's a manhunt
for Archie Andrews underway.

43
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:42,287
Police with guns and dogs,
all over the streets of Riverdale.

44
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,410
- Did you have something to do with this?
- No, Mom.

45
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,958
We didn't hear
about his escape until this morning.

46
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,837
The warden from that juvie
killed himself last night.

47
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,006
What?

48
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,008
How come?

49
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:59,429
RIVW is reporting
that he was found with blue lips.

50
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:05,393
So, he was playing G&G.

51
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,396
Mom, did you know Warden Norton?

52
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:10,183
Why would you even ask that?

53
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,014
Because he had ties
to Hiram Lodge,

54
00:03:12,035 --> 00:03:14,214
who played G&G
with you 25 years ago.

55
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,820
Sure you don't remember him?

56
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,906
Yes, I am sure, Elizabeth.

57
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,074
I've told you everything that I know.

58
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,459
I missed this.

59
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,921
I missed you, Archie.

60
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,257
[chuckles]

61
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,012
Ronnie.

62
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,599
[grunts]

63
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:48,269
I may know where the
Shadow Lake boys are.

64
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,856
The warden thought they were camping
in the abandoned mines.

65
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,982
I need to get there.

66
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,151
No, Archie, I don't
think you understand.

67
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:59,239
Outside this bunker,
there is a manhunt going on.

68
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:05,036
Roadblocks, checkpoints, wanted posters,
with your strong jawline all over town.

69
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,823
I need to find
those witnesses.

70
00:04:06,844 --> 00:04:09,185
Warden said all three
guys were paid off.

71
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,417
They're the only ones
who can clear my name.

72
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:12,919
So I can stop running.

73
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:15,004
Paid off by my father, no doubt.

74
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,423
[sighs]

75
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,594
Archie.

76
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,846
This is a long shot, but...

77
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:27,068
when Betty was working with
Attorney McCoy and your mom,

78
00:04:27,089 --> 00:04:28,329
that was at your house?

79
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,227
Yeah.

80
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,689
Are the case files still there?

81
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,857
Yeah, but they've been through them all.

82
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:36,818
And, Ronnie,

83
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,237
my dad can't know where I am.

84
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,906
Or that you saw me.
I don't want him wrapped up in this.

85
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,117
- I feel bad enough you're involved.
- Hey.

86
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,746
This was the only way
to get you out of that mess.

87
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,501
Ronnie, I took that plea deal...

88
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:58,047
because I was tired of putting my friends
and my family through hell.

89
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,008
All the people who have helped you...

90
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:03,261
are doing it because we love you.

91
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,763
So, I need you to trust me

92
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,473
to handle this.

93
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,727
And stay put.

94
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,028
[Minetta] <i>Archie is a murderer.</i>

95
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,780
And we know he didn't escape alone.
He had help.

96
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,783
Hiding a convict
or withholding information from the law

97
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,327
is a felony offense.

98
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,954
So, whoever's aided
and abetted Archie Andrews

99
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,457
is just as much of a criminal as he is.

100
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,167
I was busy all day, sheriff.

101
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,296
You can check my browser history,
if you know what I mean.

102
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,048
[classmates chuckling]

103
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,553
I don't know this Archie person.

104
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:48,014
And on Mondays,
I host a group for teen Farmies.

105
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,932
We are still accepting members.

106
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,063
Where were you, Ms. McCoy,
at the time of the breakout?

107
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,691
Don't look at me, sir. I, uh...

108
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:00,693
I...

109
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,406
I was in the music room.

110
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,284
- Practicing.
- Alone?

111
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,288
I'll look into all of your alibis.

112
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:16,417
And if I find out later
that someone in here was involved,

113
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:19,087
well, you can say
goodbye to this school,

114
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,048
your hopes and dreams.

115
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:26,511
Your music, your entire future.
All of it goes away, just like that.

116
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,603
Again, to be clear,
if you know anything,

117
00:06:28,624 --> 00:06:30,201
now's the time
to tell me...

118
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:31,307
Sheriff Minetta, back off!

119
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,440
- [boy 1] What just happened?
- [boy 2] Is she okay?

120
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,947
[Jughead] <i>Another seizure?</i>
<i>As if things weren't crazy enough.</i>

121
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,117
I know. First me, then
Ethel, then Josie?

122
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,743
What's the connection there?

123
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:53,704
Speaking of connections,
with Warden Norton dead,

124
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,790
there goes our theory
of him as the Gargoyle King.

125
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,254
Maybe not.

126
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,424
Look.

127
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,678
There's the connection between
our parents and Warden Norton.

128
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:12,098
Warden Norton was the RROTC instructor
of Riverdale High?

129
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:14,684
Yeah, the same year
our parents started the Midnight Club.

130
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,352
This proves once more

131
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,021
that our parents continue
to hide things from us.

132
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,441
And it all started
with the Midnight Club, Jug.

133
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:24,360
Featherhead was
the first blue-lipped death on record.

134
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,822
Somehow I need to get our parents
to talk to us.

135
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:30,074
Force them into telling us the truth.

136
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:33,411
- Even if that backs them into a corner.
- What'd you have in mind?

137
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:36,831
Depends whether or not
I can borrow Veronica's speakeasy.

138
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:40,293
Okay, while you're working on that,
I'm going to rally the Serpents.

139
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,337
We have to find Joaquin.
As Norton's accomplice,

140
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,549
he's our best shot to figure out
what was going on inside Norton's mind.

141
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:50,887
Bye.

142
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,770
[Sweet Pea] Minetta's trashing tent city,
Jug, looking for Archie.

143
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,525
I propose a manhunt of our own.
Every Serpent searching for Joaquin.

144
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:05,943
No stone left unturned.

145
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:09,030
Serpents don't just shiv other Serpents.
What got into him?

146
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,616
According to Archie,
Joaquin did it for Warden Norton.

147
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,619
The warden confronted Betty,
called Archie the Red Paladin.

148
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:17,997
Plus the warden poisoned himself
with cyanide and blueberry Fresh-Aid.

149
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,791
And he worked for Riverdale High
before the detention center.

150
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:24,462
The question is, was he playing G&G
with someone or for someone?

151
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:27,548
And since he's dead,
Joaquin's the only one who can know.

152
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:31,302
But Joaquin may not be alone.
Kevin said he's rolling with a new gang.

153
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:33,429
- Those gargoyle creeps you saw?
- Exactly.

154
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:39,018
And if the gang is working for the King,
then they're gonna take us right to him.

155
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:43,022
Archie, you haven't eaten your burger.

156
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,609
To be honest,
I'm not feeling so hot right now, Kev.

157
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,277
[grunts]

158
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,655
Let me see your, uh, bandage.

159
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:58,621
Okay.

160
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,290
That is definitely infected.

161
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,377
- Great.
- No worries, Arch.

162
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:08,130
Betty's got a connection.
She'll know what to do.

163
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,383
[Betty] <i>It's okay, Kevin. He's a doctor.</i>

164
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:11,884
We can trust him.

165
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,763
Oh, and bring small bills.

166
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:34,031
Elizabeth.
Don't tell me this is your doing.

167
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:42,081
I sent the invitations
from the Gargoyle King.

168
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,335
- What?
- And look, you all came.

169
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,420
What are you up to?

170
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:50,881
All of the secrets end now, Mom.

171
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,718
And this was the only way
to get all of you together.

172
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,970
Someone in this room is a murderer.

173
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,776
[Hermione] Alice, we promised each other
we would never talk about this.

174
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,904
- I mean, who else did you tell?
- I told Betty to protect her,

175
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,887
- so she wouldn't play the game.
- And it worked. I'm not playing the game.

176
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:20,119
But many of your kids are.
This is about protecting them.

177
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:21,522
- Don't you care?
- [Sierra] Care?

178
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:25,082
Josie had a seizure this morning.
I should be with her right now.

179
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:28,127
Not here, rehashing the past,
when it has zero relevance.

180
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,671
Attorney McCoy, it is relevant.

181
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:34,634
Your daughter is playing the game,
along with Kevin and Cheryl.

182
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,260
Even your son Reggie, Mr. Mantle,

183
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,220
no matter
how many black eyes you give him.

184
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:40,848
I would never hit my son.

185
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,308
Another lie.

186
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,727
Guys, it was bound to get out sometime.

187
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,022
Our children need to know the truth.
Betty, where do we start?

188
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,691
With the dead warden
from Archie's juvie.

189
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:54,862
He was also the RROTC instructor
when you guys were in high school.

190
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:58,157
Mr. Keller, you were a cadet then.
Did you play the game with him?

191
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,911
Major Norton just confiscated
a stray manual. That's all.

192
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,331
Mr. Lodge, you had business dealings

193
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,083
with Warden Norton until he died.

194
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:11,212
What were they? And did you know
that he was playing G&G?

195
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:14,423
None of your business, and not a clue.

196
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,467
What about Ascension Night?
Was he there?

197
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,010
How can we answer that?

198
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:21,389
We were all high off our gourds,
hallucinating gargoyles.

199
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,642
Wait, FP. You saw it, too?

200
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,436
Oh, this is such a waste of our time.

201
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,689
I have a job that I need to get back to.

202
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,107
So, if you'll excuse me...

203
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,400
No, Hiram.

204
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:37,530
Let's just get this over with.
Otherwise, it will never end.

205
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,202
Betty, you wanna know
who poisoned the chalice.

206
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,289
The Game Master is the one
who sets up the game.

207
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,000
So, my instinct is telling me that...

208
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,003
the culprit was Penelope Blossom.

209
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:56,966
My guess is maybe she grew the poison
in her greenhouse.

210
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:00,094
You don't grow cyanide, Hermione.

211
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:02,304
A fact that only a Blossom would know.

212
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,227
[sighs]

213
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,689
It was Daryl Doiley.

214
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,318
We were both Game Masters.

215
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,821
And he was secretly in love with me.

216
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,117
He put poison in the chalice,

217
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,828
because he wanted us to ascend together.

218
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,457
But I said no.

219
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:34,378
I assumed...

220
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:39,759
the chalices were emptied afterwards,
but they were not.

221
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,261
Years later, Daryl came to me,

222
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,847
riddled with guilt
over that tragic incident,

223
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,432
and seeking comfort.

224
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,436
And I refused him again.

225
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,940
We were both married
with families, and...

226
00:12:56,776 --> 00:13:02,364
I was afraid, you see,
of revisiting that unholy night.

227
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:05,778
So, he left. The next day...

228
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,999
he was found dead in his garage.

229
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,796
Sitting in his sedan,
engine running, windows up.

230
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:19,965
[sighs]

231
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,434
Dilton Doiley's dead dad did it?

232
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,562
That explains how Dilton got his hands
on the game,

233
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,022
and why he started playing.

234
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:38,943
No, but that doesn't explain
who the Gargoyle King is today.

235
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,945
- Jughead and I saw him.
- What do you mean?

236
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:43,948
In Fox Forest. We've tried to
track him down ever since.

237
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,991
Why do you think Jughead
started playing?

238
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,370
- He's not still playing, is he?
- I'm afraid so, Mr. Jones.

239
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:53,499
He's made some really weird connections
between the game and Riverdale,

240
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,918
- which he wouldn't have...
- I've heard enough.

241
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,670
Boy's gonna be the death of me.

242
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,807
Satisfied, Elizabeth?

243
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:10,891
No, Mom.

244
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:13,769
Not even close.

245
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:19,942
[cell phone buzzing]

246
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,362
Fangs. Did you find Joaquin?

247
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:26,949
[Fangs] <i>Centerville Serpents spotted him</i>
<i>at the Last Resort Youth Hostel.</i>

248
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,450
- <i>We're on our way.</i>
- Grab him.

249
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,703
Take him to Fox Forest,
near the footbridge.

250
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,872
- I'll meet you there.
- <i>On it, boss man.</i>

251
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,000
- [FP] Going somewhere, boy?
- To meet the Serpents.

252
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,835
Yeah? Like hell you are.

253
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,838
What are you doing?
Are you out of your mind?

254
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:43,028
What I should have done,
the second I saw you playing.

255
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,968
You're addicted. G&G's like a drug.
It got into your blood.

256
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,052
I'm not addicted.

257
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:49,930
I just need to ascend,

258
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,350
so I can find the Gargoyle King,
and put an end to all this.

259
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:54,935
You're right.

260
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,855
You sound nothing like an addict.
My mistake.

261
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,568
It's time for you to sober up, boy.
For your own good.

262
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,122
[Archie grunts]

263
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,166
[Curdle Jr.] Keep it clean and dry.

264
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,877
As for the infection,

265
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:23,339
I have some antibiotics
in the back room.

266
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,466
That is,

267
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,010
if you have something for me.

268
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:32,348
Thank you, Dr. Curdle Junior.
Betty said to pay you in small bills.

269
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:40,189
- We should get back to the bunker.
- I can't go back there.

270
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,666
I'm going to Shadow Lake, to the mines,

271
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,735
to find the guys responsible
for putting me away.

272
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,821
How far do you think you're gonna get,
on foot and alone?

273
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,073
Will you help me, Kev?

274
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,410
Veronica is going to kill me.

275
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:05,005
[Minetta on video] <i>Okay, Donny.</i>
<i>Let's try this one more time.</i>

276
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,552
<i>Come on. I don't have all day.</i>

277
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:14,723
What the hell?

278
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,351
[rewinding]

279
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,356
Oh, my God. It's been edited.

280
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:24,942
Veronica?

281
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,696
Are those Archie's case files?

282
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,867
He's not going to be
behind bars ever again, Daddy.

283
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:36,286
That's a promise.

284
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:50,718
There are too many variables
up at Shadow Lake.

285
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:53,125
Take care of them. All of them.

286
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,559
[Betty knocking on door] Jug?

287
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,269
- Are you...?
- [Jughead] Betty.

288
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:03,272
- Are you hungry?
- Jug. What the hell?

289
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,984
You don't have a trusty
bobby pin, do you?

290
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:08,402
Always.

291
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,446
Did your dad do this?

292
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,072
Yeah. He doesn't
like me playing G&G.

293
00:17:12,093 --> 00:17:13,310
That's my fault.
I'm sorry.

294
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,327
It came out when I talked
to all of our parents.

295
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,329
How'd that sit-down go, Miss Marple?

296
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:23,333
Penelope Blossom said Daryl Doiley
is the one who poisoned the chalices.

297
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,085
[groans]

298
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:27,880
Dilton's dad?

299
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,090
- Isn't he...?
- Dead? Yeah.

300
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,508
Pretty convenient, right?

301
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,970
The one man who can't confirm
or deny Penelope's story.

302
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,930
- I don't buy that.
- Neither do I, Jug.

303
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:41,101
I called Dr. Curdle Junior and asked
if he'd pull Mr. Doiley's autopsy report.

304
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,960
Think you can handle this yourself?

305
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,292
Sweet Pea and Fangs
maybe found Joaquin.

306
00:17:45,313 --> 00:17:46,752
Just be careful, Jug.

307
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:50,819
I know we're getting close
to something, Betty.

308
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,497
[cell phone ringing]

309
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:04,708
[Kevin sighs]

310
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,877
Hey, Veronica. What's up?

311
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,713
Seriously, Kevin? You had one job to do.

312
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,049
Put Archie on right the hell now.

313
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,013
Don't blame Kev. It was all me.

314
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,307
<i>If you tell me you're going
to Shadow Mines...</i>

315
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,448
I am. It's my one
shot to clear my name.

316
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:23,372
<i>But it's not.</i>

317
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,686
I found something.

318
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:30,150
Ten minutes of Minetta's interrogation
of the Shadow Lake boys was deleted.

319
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,902
I just have to find the missing footage.

320
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,862
- Wouldn't it have been destroyed?
- <i>No.</i>

321
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:37,157
My dad hangs on to dirt in case
he needs to lord it over someone.

322
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,534
Think it's in his study?

323
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,828
Something as radioactive as this?

324
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,039
He'd keep it far away from himself.

325
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:49,378
Closer to, let's say,
the Mayor's Office.

326
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:52,047
It's worth a look,
but it won't change my plans.

327
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:53,423
Fine.

328
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:57,010
Tell Kevin if he doesn't
get you back to me in one piece,

329
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,637
<i>I will eviscerate him.</i>

330
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:17,156
So, what's the plan?
I mean, what if these guys are armed?

331
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,200
And you're a sneeze away
from tearing those stitches.

332
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,285
Kevin, I'm fine.

333
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:22,828
Shh.

334
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,538
[man] Tango-ten-Charlie...

335
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,721
[Veronica] Always my birthday.

336
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:51,773
[chuckles]

337
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,279
Holy crap. Please, be it.

338
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:06,413
[Minetta] <i>Okay, Donny.</i>
<i>Let's try this one more time.</i>

339
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,123
<i>Ten thousand apiece.</i>

340
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:13,045
<i>You just say that you saw Archie Andrews
kill your friend Cassidy Bullock.</i>

341
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,797
If that's not proof of coercion,
I don't know what is.

342
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,767
Come on, Internet.

343
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,644
Come on.

344
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:32,105
- [knocking on door]
- [Gloria] She's in here.

345
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,065
[knocking continues]

346
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,399
- Come on.
- Hello?

347
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,906
I'm the mayor's daughter. I can be here.

348
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,824
False. Her mother and father told me

349
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,619
to call the Sheriff's Department
if she broke in again.

350
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,957
Okay. That's not necessary.

351
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,960
[Sweet Pea] Get up.

352
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,044
Get up!

353
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,927
[Joaquin grunting] Look
what we found on him.

354
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,765
So, you jumped ship for
the gargoyle gang?

355
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,434
You have a lot of explaining to do.

356
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,853
[grunts then coughs]

357
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,398
Why not start with why
you shivved Archie,

358
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,561
instead of protecting him,
like you were supposed to?

359
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,903
The warden said I had no other choice.

360
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,822
You don't know what it's like there.

361
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,282
You do anything to survive.

362
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:27,369
For me, it was being the warden's pawn.
A chess piece.

363
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:30,914
- In some ways, he was a pawn, too.
- What does that mean?

364
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,959
I saw him with these game cards
that told him what to do.

365
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,795
Whoever sent them wanted Archie dead.

366
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:39,965
From the moment he was locked up,
he was already marked.

367
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,760
[Jughead] Marked with what?

368
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:46,388
This symbol...

369
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:49,349
the warden branded on Archie's hip?

370
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:50,642
What does it mean?

371
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:52,019
No, no.

372
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,148
- Pick him up.
- No, no, no.

373
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:59,526
Just... Hey, just... Just stop.
Just stop.

374
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:00,569
Okay.

375
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:04,740
Sacrifice.

376
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:06,867
It means that...

377
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,619
It meant that Archie had to die.

378
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,498
Look, I'm sorry, Jug.
I know he was your pal. I...

379
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:14,708
Oh, Archie's alive.

380
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,419
He won't be for much longer.

381
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,046
Who's giving Warden Norton his orders?

382
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:21,715
- No.
- Okay.

383
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:24,176
- I don't think you understand.
- No.

384
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:26,553
I can't let you go until you talk.

385
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:34,519
I saw them meet once.

386
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,064
But you know him, Jones.

387
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,482
The man in the black suit.

388
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,568
[Jughead] <i>An ancient evil long
forgotten has awoken.</i>

389
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:44,529
The embodiment of pure
malice and cruelty.

390
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:47,908
It finally happened.

391
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:49,993
You've lost your mind.

392
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,746
You met Warden Norton in high school.

393
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:55,415
All this time,
you've sent him quest cards,

394
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,418
instructing him how to torture
and then kill Archie.

395
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:04,549
You're not just the criminal kingpin
of Riverdale. You're the Gargoyle King.

396
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,426
- What did you call me?
- The Gargoyle King.

397
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:10,806
The Ghoulies and this new gang
of gargoyles are your soldiers.

398
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,016
The Southside is your kingdom.

399
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,520
You orchestrated Archie's arrest to put
him under Norton's sadistic thumb.

400
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:19,147
The game is how
you've been communicating with him,

401
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,273
pulling the strings.

402
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:22,776
Back in the day,
you killed Principal Featherhead

403
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,339
in the same way you tried to kill me,

404
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,279
and in the same way you tried
to kill Archie.

405
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,323
You're the Gargoyle King, Hiram.

406
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,537
I am not a 16-year-old
nerd playing games

407
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,957
to live out
my overactive hormonal fantasies.

408
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,876
I'm not the Gargoyle King.
Because you know what?

409
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,753
That's not a real thing.

410
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:45,841
Nor am I the murderer that you
and Betty Cooper are looking for.

411
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,885
But if homicidal parents
are what you're after,

412
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:51,388
may I suggest Clifford Blossom...

413
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:54,558
Hal Cooper, Tom Keller.

414
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:57,519
And perhaps...

415
00:23:58,687 --> 00:23:59,813
even your own father.

416
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,857
They all make solid suspects.

417
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,027
[phone ringing]

418
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,321
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to take this.

419
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,868
You'll see yourself out, won't you?

420
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:20,333
[sighs] This is Lodge.

421
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,420
She did what?

422
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:33,555
What exactly were you hoping to find
in your mother's office, Veronica?

423
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:37,100
Does Mom even know
what you've been hiding on her desktop?

424
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,606
She doesn't have a
computer anymore.

425
00:24:38,627 --> 00:24:40,124
I've requested to
speak to a lawyer.

426
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,319
It's my right as an American citizen.

427
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:53,825
So, get your lapdog, Sheriff Minetta,
to bring me to the phone.

428
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,243
Minetta. Hmm.

429
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:57,913
He's otherwise engaged.

430
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,124
But let me see what I can do.

431
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,295
[Fred] <i>Yeah, Veronica,
is everything okay?</i>

432
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:07,172
Have you heard from Archie?

433
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:10,008
He asked me not to tell you,
Mr. Andrews, but...

434
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:13,345
Archie's headed for the mines
by Shadow Lake with Kevin

435
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:15,347
<i>to look for the guys
who testified against him.</i>

436
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:19,184
My intuition tells me
Sheriff Minetta may be doing the same.

437
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:23,146
- Okay. Uh, I'm on the way.
- <i>Wait.</i>

438
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,065
Tell Archie
I found what I was looking for.

439
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:26,566
I just have to get it to the judge.

440
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,276
- Veronica, I...
- <i>And on that note,</i>

441
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,737
would you mind
calling Attorney McCoy for me?

442
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:37,661
[Betty] <i>I'm confused.</i>

443
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:41,498
Why is there no mention
of carbon monoxide in Mr. Doiley's file?

444
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:44,042
Because it was not
the cause of death, Ms. Cooper.

445
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:48,213
Daryl Doiley was indeed found
in a running car with the windows up,

446
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:51,007
but there was no trace
of carbon monoxide in his lungs.

447
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:53,426
That can only mean he
was dead beforehand.

448
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:57,430
Then how did he die, Dr. Curdle Junior?

449
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:02,894
Oleander.

450
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:06,856
If ingested, it's one of the most
poisonous plants known to mankind.

451
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,483
In my opinion, Ms. Cooper,

452
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:12,153
Daryl Doiley's death was a murder,
disguised as a suicide.

453
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,197
Can that be proven with this file?

454
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,824
Unfortunately, no.

455
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,286
This is from my father's
personal collection.

456
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:22,455
Fine. Then I'll just have
to question whoever closed the case.

457
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:24,040
Doctor...

458
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:28,044
who was the sheriff
at the time of Mr. Doiley's death?

459
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,839
Thank you for meeting me, Mr. Keller.

460
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:31,840
Sure.

461
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,592
Mr. Doiley's death was classified

462
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:37,137
as suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning,
by your department.

463
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:41,182
Yet oddly enough there wasn't
a trace of it found in his lungs.

464
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,643
What is this, Betty?
Is this another ambush?

465
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,270
Because I didn't kill anybody.

466
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:47,731
Maybe not,
but you're complicit in a cover-up.

467
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,483
Who were you protecting?

468
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:57,198
All of us.

469
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:00,243
Your mother included.

470
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:02,996
Someone murdered Daryl Doiley.

471
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:07,208
Whoever was pulling the strings back then
may be the one killing people today.

472
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:11,421
The truth is it could've
been any member of the Midnight Club.

473
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:17,385
But only one of us grows oleander
in their greenhouse.

474
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,471
Now, I know this because I saw it

475
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:22,223
when I was investigating
Jason Blossom's murder.

476
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:25,143
- Uh, wait, Mr. Keller, can...?
- [cell phone buzzing]

477
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:26,895
Yeah, Fred. What?

478
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,566
Son of a gun. All right, all right.
I'll be right there.

479
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,942
- Mr. Keller...
- I gotta go.

480
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:58,885
Come on.

481
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,519
Let's keep going.

482
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,993
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, no. It's the Shadow Lake crew.

483
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,787
[Kevin] And Sheriff
Minetta was just here.

484
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:31,918
Hey, hey.

485
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,424
He's still alive.
We gotta get him to a hospital.

486
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:38,717
- Archie...
- Minetta shot them because of me.

487
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,970
I can't have any more blood on my hands.
Now grab his legs.

488
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,356
[Sweet Pea] Someone's sending us
a message, Jones.

489
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:55,483
- What's the message?
- Come on.

490
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:16,212
Joaquin.

491
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:24,888
Who do you think did it?

492
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,391
Uh...

493
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,144
I don't know.

494
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,608
The Gargoyle Gang, or Hiram Lodge.
It could be anyone.

495
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:39,903
That symbol on his forehead.

496
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:42,447
Sacrifice.

497
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,660
I have to get to Archie.

498
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:52,165
[motorcycle revving]

499
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,172
We're too late.

500
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:03,009
Well, for all we know, Archie and
Kevin never made it here, Fred.

501
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:07,263
Yeah, this is Tom Keller.
I'd like to report a multiple 187.

502
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:10,475
Two young men, Shadow Lake Mine.

503
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:12,268
Gunshots.

504
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,455
Police were called
to Shadow Lake Hospital.

505
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,112
A boy was brought in.
Critical condition with gunshot wounds.

506
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,365
- Is it Kevin or Archie?
- They can't tell me.

507
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:26,908
No ID. Come on. We should go.

508
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,339
I just heard from the nurse.

509
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:45,093
He didn't make it, Archie.
They said he lost too much blood.

510
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:47,662
I'm sorry, man. Everywhere I go...

511
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,560
everything I do just
leads to more death.

512
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,228
More pain.

513
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:57,897
Those guys would still be alive
if I wasn't in the picture.

514
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,046
Let me remind you, those
guys weren't innocent. Okay?

515
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:01,441
They were... They
were criminals.

516
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,571
They didn't deserve to die for it.

517
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:08,616
Hiram Lodge has done everything
in his power to destroy me.

518
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,287
And he won't stop until I'm dead, too.

519
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:16,416
Even if by some... Some miracle,

520
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,710
my innocence is proven...

521
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,463
I don't think I can
go back to Riverdale.

522
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:33,224
Attorney McCoy,
thank you for posting my bail.

523
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:34,893
How's Josie doing?

524
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:37,604
She's resting.
And what about you, Veronica?

525
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:38,688
You tell me.

526
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,525
If one has concrete proof of coercion

527
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,235
and tampering of evidence,

528
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:47,530
would it be enough
to free the wrongfully accused?

529
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,784
[Betty] <i>Mrs. Blossom.</i>

530
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,870
Please, Betty. Call me Aunty.

531
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:56,706
Aunty Blossom...

532
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:01,294
Mr. Doiley died from oleander poisoning.

533
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,715
Do you have that flower
in your greenhouse?

534
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:19,854
Even if I wanted to
poison Daryl Doiley...

535
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:24,150
I wouldn't use oleander.
It leaves traces.

536
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:31,366
You know, Betty, I came here to help you,
out of the kindness of my heart.

537
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,035
But if you're looking for someone
to accuse,

538
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,244
it was your own mother

539
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,747
who wrote the article
reporting Daryl's suicide.

540
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:41,334
So, maybe you should ask yourself,
and her,

541
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,462
what reasons she had
for covering up a murder.

542
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,887
Well, do you have anything
to say for yourself, Mom?

543
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:58,935
[sighs] You have shaken every tree today.
I'm sure there's nothing left to say.

544
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:02,021
How about that you helped
cover up Daryl Doiley's murder?

545
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,065
Oh, Betty. When will you stop?

546
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,359
When you stop lying to me, Mom.

547
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:09,529
Mr. Doiley didn't die
from carbon monoxide inhalation,

548
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:11,614
like you wrote in this article.

549
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:13,992
Someone staged it to
look like a suicide.

550
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:16,995
Someone afraid
of what Mr. Doiley might say.

551
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:20,081
Thanks to Sheriff Keller,
there was no murder investigation.

552
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,958
You all have a hand in this.

553
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,836
You're all just circling the wagons,
playing a part.

554
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,379
Why, Mom?

555
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,339
Who are you protecting?

556
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:29,632
[thunder rumbling]

557
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,470
- Mom?
- Stay here.

558
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,973
- I'll check the circuit breaker.
- No, I'm coming.

559
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:38,975
[banging on door]

560
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:43,688
Who is it? Who's there?

561
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:48,401
Mom. Hello?

562
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:54,991
Betty, call 911.

563
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,385
Oh, my God.

564
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:17,555
They were in here.

565
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:24,353
Get behind me, Betty.

566
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:26,981
Come on.

567
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:33,529
Whoa, whoa. I was looking for Jughead,
but someone slammed the door in my face.

568
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:36,783
- I was trying to get in.
- FP, the Gargoyle King is in the house.

569
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:37,950
He's in the house.

570
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,243
Shh.

571
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:41,496
It's okay.

572
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,247
It's okay.

573
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:53,508
Excuse me.

574
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,594
- A boy was brought here. He was shot.
- [Kevin] Dad?

575
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:57,512
[Keller] Hey.

576
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:00,473
- You all right?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

577
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:04,393
Um, where's Archie? Is...?

578
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:07,355
He's okay, Mr. Andrews, but he's gone.

579
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:10,566
He, uh... He left you something. A note.

580
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,292
Someone let you out of your cage, I see.

581
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:30,837
What do you mean, Hiram?

582
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,547
You didn't know, Mom?

583
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,883
Your husband left me in a jail cell,

584
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,885
for putting my nose
where it didn't belong.

585
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,929
But it was so worth it.

586
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:42,765
- What are you talking about?
- Archie, of course.

587
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:46,978
I found the deleted tape
of Sheriff Minetta coercing witnesses.

588
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:50,648
Attorney McCoy's meeting with the judge
to overturn Archie's conviction.

589
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,400
Your henchman, Minetta...

590
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,193
[chuckles]

591
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,279
is going down.

592
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:59,031
And if you two evildoers
go down with him,

593
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:01,868
so be it.

594
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:06,747
[Alice] <i>We're no longer safe, Betty.</i>

595
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,834
And that attack was only the beginning.

596
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:13,379
It's clear that you won't
drop this investigation,

597
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:15,006
no matter the consequences.

598
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:17,300
And this house is no longer safe.

599
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,177
Which is why...

600
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,263
I'm going to the Farm,

601
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:25,850
with Polly and the twins.

602
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:26,934
Well, have fun.

603
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,937
Because I'm definitely not going
to the Farm.

604
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,939
No. You're not.

605
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:32,982
[door opens]

606
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,277
Edgar said that you would resist.

607
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:40,656
- And that we should send you elsewhere.
- Mom, what's...? What's happening?

608
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,743
Betty, there's no safer
place for you now.

609
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:46,537
The Sisters protected me.
They protected Polly.

610
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:47,901
They'll watch over you. No. Mom.

611
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:51,375
Mom.

612
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:54,045
Are you out of your mind?
Why are you doing this?

613
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:56,088
Because I love you, Elizabeth.

614
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,423
Hey. Mom.

615
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,550
Let me go. Mom.

616

[cell phone ringing]

617
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,810
What do you mean, "he's gone," Kevin?

618
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:12,688
Believe me, I tried.
Archie said he couldn't come back.

619
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,857
Only because he doesn't know
he's been exonerated.

620
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:17,777
- And you let him go alone?
- Not... Not alone.

621
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,736
He called...

622
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:19,904
[cell phone ringing]

623
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,994
- Archie?

Veronica.

625
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,582
I am so glad you called, Archie.

626
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:34,543
We did it. Attorney McCoy worked it out
with the judge.

627
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:35,666
<i>You're a free man.</i>

628
00:37:35,687 --> 00:37:38,025
I shouldn't be surprised.
You're amazing.

629
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,113
I promised you'd be
free by homecoming.

630
00:37:40,134 --> 00:37:41,904
<i>Veronica Lodge

631
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,094
Thank you, Veronica.

632
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,097
For everything you've done for me.

633
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:47,848
No need to thank me, lover.

634
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,351
Just tell me where to pick you up.

635
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,110
Ronnie, I...

636
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,197
I can't come home.

637
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:06,492
Didn't you hear me?

638
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,663
There's nothing to be afraid of.

639
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:14,250
Sheriff Minetta's going to prison
for a long, long time.

640
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:15,960
But your dad is still out there.

641
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:18,629
And I can't escape him.

642
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,513
As long as we're together,
he'll hunt me down.

Everyone close to me is his target.
That includes you.

Because we're endgame, Archie.

I'm right about this.

Leaving is my best option, Jug.

667
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,430
It's my only option. I don't disagree.

00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,881
Joaquin is dead.

669
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:30,845
That symbol you have branded on your hip,
he had one on his forehead.

670
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,514
It means "sacrifice."

671
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:34,890
What?

672
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:38,269
- Who the hell is doing this?
- I don't know.

673
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:42,064
I have a feeling
Hiram Lodge is a part of it.

He always is.
