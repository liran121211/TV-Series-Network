1
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:09,884
[narrator] Previously on Riverdale:

2
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:12,303
He was there to kill me.
That's the real Archie Andrews.

3
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:14,848
[Veronica]
I don't own the diner. My father does.

4
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:17,225
And La Bonne Nuit, too.
Will you help me, Archie?

5
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:19,644
This time,
we can take down my father for good.

6
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:22,063
-Hell, yeah.
-I have someone who can help you.

7
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:23,648
A friend of mine from the Farm.

8
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:25,608
[Betty] Groups like the Farm prey

9
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,902
on emotionally vulnerable people.

10
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:30,155
You're actually buying this Farm crap.

11
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:33,408
[Alice] Edgar and I have a deep
understanding of one another.

12
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:36,494
Everyone in your life is here,
in this room.

13
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:39,164
Join us, and we can unpack

14
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:42,083
this obsession you have
with the Gargoyle King.

15
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,960
[Ethel] I've seen him, the Gargoyle King.

16
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:44,919
He's out there.

17
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:45,920
I need your help.

18
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:48,381
This game is literally killing people.

19
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,008
Ben and I thought it was just a game.

20
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:51,718
But it's not. It's so much more.

21
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:53,386
Were you playing G&G with Dilton?

22
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,722
He was teaching me how to play
so I could join the game.

23
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,432
[Jellybean] Ricky said that the Gospel's

24
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:59,601
where the Gargoyle King keeps
all his secrets.

25
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:02,520
[Betty] The Gospel that we found
and the proclamation was

26
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,272
to get me alone with my dad again.

27
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:07,984
[Jughead] Return of the Black Hood. Now
we have two serial killers running around.

28
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,486
Possibly working together.

29
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:14,324
[Jughead] It was the deadliest prom night
since Carrie's.

30
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:18,286
Riverdale High had been overrun
by the Black Hood,

31
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:19,496
my girlfriend's dad,

32
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:20,914
and the Gargoyle King,

33
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:23,249
true identity yet to be determined.

34
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,336
We needed answers, starting with...

35
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:30,048
So, how in the hell did Hal Cooper
fake his own death in a bus explosion?

36
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:35,386
Well, I re-examined the telltale hand
recovered from the bus.

37
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,554
See here?

38
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:39,015
The erratic incision at the wrist leads me
to think

39
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,185
this amputation was self-inflicted.

40
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,229
So, the Black Hood cut off his own hand

41
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,856
and left it behind
to convince everyone he died?

42
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,650
It's not an easy task.

43
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:51,027
There are eight bones in the human wrist.

44
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:56,407
Forget it, Hiram.
I will not endorse or support this.

45
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,118
We have drugs on our streets,

46
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,120
gangs at every corner.

47
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,580
Riverdale is broken,
about to slide off a cliff,

48
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,707
and the only way to save it is
to privatize it.

49
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:08,044
And by "privatize," you mean
you want to buy the town of Riverdale.

50
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,089
I'd like to put in a bid
to relieve our town of its debts

51
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:12,507
and assume its leadership.

52
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:17,887
So, yes, I plan to buy Riverdale,
with or without your support.

53
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:21,599
And Governor Dooley has already signed off
on this strategy, so...

54
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,186
My advice?

55
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:27,897
Clear out your office.

56
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,569
The deed, the contract I signed,

57
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:33,862
none of it matters.

58
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:34,904
It was all fake.

59
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,282
My dad still owns Pop's,
and the speakeasy,

60
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:39,617
and I'm a fool for ever trusting him.

61
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,078
And on top of everything he's done to me,

62
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,497
he's now planning
on buying the entire town.

63
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,249
Yeah, Ronnie, your dad sucks.

64
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:50,461
Wait a minute.

65
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,756
[chuckles] What about
all of the shady stuff

66
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,175
that goes down at the speakeasy?

67
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:58,928
If it's my dad's name on the deed,
can't he be prosecuted for it?

68
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:00,972
"Shady stuff," as in...?

69
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,765
Drinking without carding.

70
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,602
And-or illegal gambling, let's say?

71
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,437
Hiram did these things?

72
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,022
Well, technically, no.

73
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,064
Not exactly.

74
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:15,195
But if the property were under his name,
doesn't that make him liable?

75
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:19,157
I think I know someone
who might be able to help.

76
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:23,828
[EKG beeping]

77
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,301
[Mary] Ardelia and I went
to Sarah Florence together.

78
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,886
Now she's my friend at the FBI.

79
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:42,680
The FBI's had their eye
on Hiram Lodge for a long time.

80
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,933
He served less than a year
for embezzlement.

81
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,977
Whatever we can charge him with
in the future, it's gotta be gangbusters.

82
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:52,690
How about serving alcohol to minors,
and operating an illegal casino?

83
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:53,691
And doctoring books?

84
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,610
Aren't those crimes you committed?

85
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:58,404
My client can neither confirm
nor deny that statement.

86
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,866
Don't worry. We want your father, not you.

87
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,620
If none of this stuff will be enough
to get Hiram arrested, then what will?

88
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:06,955
Catch him red-handed.

89
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:10,333
We need to arrest Hiram committing a crime
in real time.

90
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,336
Understood, Agent Ardelia.
Let me see what I can do.

91
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:16,798
[Edgar] Betty.

92
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,591
Now that you're here,

93
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,178
your mother and sister have something
they'd like to tell you.

94
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:26,808
Go ahead, Alice.

95
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,186
[sighs]

96
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,146
Honey, when you were eight,

97
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,608
you spent some time in the hospital
after you fell off your bike

98
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:36,776
and got a concussion.

99
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,613
While you were there,
the doctors ran a bunch of tests, and...

100
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,032
they discovered...

101
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:46,869
What?

102
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:50,665
What, Mom?

103
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:57,297
They discovered that you have the MAOA
and the CDH13 genes,

104
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,965
which are commonly called...

105
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,258
The serial killer genes.

106
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:04,012
They tested the rest of us for it.
None of us have it. Not even Dad.

107
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:08,057
It's just you, Betty.
You have a predisposition to violence.

108
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:17,025
But now that you know you have it,
and you're here,

109
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,068
Edgar can help you heal.

110
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:22,947
How...?

111
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,450
If-- If this is true,

112
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,202
how can you help me?

113
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,665
Let's start by talking.

114
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:39,630
Just because you were born with a malady
doesn't mean it defines you.

115
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:42,258
Destiny...

116
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,512
it's a false notion.

117
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:50,058
You are destined to make a choice.

118
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:56,564
Give in to your proclivity, or fight it.

119
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,359
Tell me your fears.

120
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:02,862
Now...

121
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:04,530
begin.

122
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:13,414
I've always felt like there's
another person inside of me.

123
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,961
A person capable of doing dark,
terrible things.

124
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,465
And I don't know how to get rid of her.

125
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:27,720
The first step is confrontation.

126
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,819
[Shadow Betty] Hi, Betty.

127
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,278
Hello.

128
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,031
Who are you?

129
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,367
Take a closer look.

130
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,664
We know each other very, very well.

131
00:06:58,626 --> 00:06:59,460
You're...

132
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:01,838
me.

133
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,048
I'm the shadows...

134
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:07,510
that you hide from our family and friends.

135
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,515
I'm all the dark deeds you did
in our youth...

136
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:14,684
and now.

137
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,146
Like what we did to our old cat, Caramel.

138
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,481
Caramel ran away.

139
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,025
I didn't do anything to her.

140
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,153
[chuckles] Oh, Betty.

141
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,447
We both know that we drowned Caramel.

142
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,531
What?

143
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,326
What about the time
we pushed Polly down the stairs?

144
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,579
Or do you not remember that, either?

145
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,248
No, that's...

146
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,835
That's not true.

147
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,462
Oh, but it is.

148
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:43,921
Here's what else is true.

149
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,257
I am not a part of you.

150
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,761
You are a part of me.

151
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,849
I am the real Elizabeth Cooper.

152
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,768
You are the illusion.

153
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:58,936
[groaning]

154
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,996
The first few sessions,
it's normal to feel disoriented.

155
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,082
What else did you feel?

156
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,754
I have this, um...

157
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:29,675
A stabbing pain in my forehead.

158
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,137
Your body's located your trauma.

159
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,849
That's step one.

160
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,321
Healing is painful.

161
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,614
But together,

162
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,159
we can discharge that pain forever.

163
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,871
This is just the beginning.

164
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,634
I thought the Farm would keep me safe
from the Black Hood.

165
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:12,760
But, bonus,

166
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:16,305
I'm also learning a bunch of fun,
terrifying facts about myself.

167
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,349
I had a session with Edgar,

168
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:21,310
and I still can't wrap my mind
around what happened.

169
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:26,023
Betty, don't let Edgar,
or these Farmies, get inside your head.

170
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,776
Well, he had these magnetic balls
on his desk

171
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:31,279
that were clicking and clacking.

172
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,489
Well, maybe he's using sound
to try and influence you.

173
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,533
Do you need me to get you out of there?

174
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:38,619
No.

175
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:40,997
No.

176
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,252
I think I have an idea
for my next session with Edgar.

177
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:51,132
It's time I find out
what the Farm is about,

178
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,592
once and for all.

179
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,261
I need to find out the connection

180
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,096
between the Gargoyle King
and the Black Hood.

181
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,683
Oh, I had a thought about that.

182
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:04,645
The reason I went off alone during prom
was because someone dressed as a jester

183
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,897
gave me an envelope
from the Gargoyle King.

184
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,482
Okay, I got my quest.

185
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,528
"Follow the envelope."

186
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,364
Godspeed, my brave Hellcaster.

187
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,699
Bye. Be safe.

188
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,661
[school bell ringing]

189
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:27,877
Ah.

190
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,795
It's Louie, right?

191
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,005
Yeah, and?

192
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,923
Well, this is kind of a funny story,

193
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:36,427
but a jester gave my girlfriend
an envelope at prom,

194
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,511
so, I asked around.

195
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:38,804
Jester's name was Jerry.

196
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:42,141
Jerry told me that he got the envelope
from a druid named Loona.

197
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:46,103
Loona said that she got the envelope
from a centaur named...

198
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:48,689
Louie.

199
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:49,607
True or false?

200
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,192
Yeah, I gave it to Loona.

201
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:54,362
Okay. So, here's the 20-dollar question.

202
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,821
Mm.

203
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:57,782
Who'd you get the envelope from?

204
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,164
Some kid gave it to me.

205
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:06,540
He looked homeless.

206
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:07,458
A kid?

207
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:12,755
Was he around 13? Brown hair, brown eyes?

208
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,549
Thank you, Louie.

209
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:24,725
Can I join you guys?

210
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,394
Oh, of course, cousin.

211
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,313
[Fangs groans]

212
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,273
Fangs, are you okay?

213
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,693
Yeah, I'm still a little sore.

214
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,778
But the big pain is gone now.

215
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,489
What are you talking about?

216
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:40,825
Fangs had a minor procedure done.

217
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,785
What kind of procedure did you have?

218
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,455
It's a... purging

219
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,125
of all of the pain
that's been crushing us.

220
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,252
I can't wait for mine to be gone, too.

221
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:54,380
Hold on. Cheryl, you're in pain?

222
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:55,506
Like, physical pain?

223
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:59,927
Well, it's just part of Edgar's methods.

224
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:04,140
He transforms our emotional pain
into physical pain,

225
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,434
so it's easier to treat, and banish.

226
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,977
But me first, babe.

227
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,396
That's right. Tee-Tee's next in line.

228
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:13,482
For me, the tenderness in my back
only lasted a few days.

229
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,025
But it was so worth it.

230
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:16,610
[Kevin chuckles]

231
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,780
Oh, my God, Kevin.

232
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,867
That scar is not from a minor procedure.

233
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,285
That's from major surgery.

234
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,911
Don't ever do that again, Betty.

235
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:28,622
Kev...

236
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,794
[knocking on door]

237
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:37,298
-Ronnie.
-Archie.

238
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,760
I have a plan to catch my father,

239
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,595
to put him back behind bars
where he belongs,

240
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,430
and stop him from buying our town.

241
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:45,765
Okay. What is it?

242
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,726
It's gonna require
that we each play our parts flawlessly,

243
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,352
and you're up first.

244
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,230
[Hiram] Big change is coming to Riverdale.

245
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:54,815
Opportunities.

246
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,108
Riverfront.

247
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,235
Northside.

248
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:01,489
I'm gonna need some strong allies
I can trust.

249
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:05,242
Archie Andrews, what a surprise.

250
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,828
I heard you're trying to buy Riverdale,
Mr. Lodge.

251
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,539
My town. I can't let that happen.

252
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,624
It's all right, Archie.

253
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,460
It's a good thing for everyone.
You'll see.

254
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:17,588
I am sick of you thinking
you can control everyone,

255
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:18,881
take over everything.

256
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,508
You think you're unstoppable,

257
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,092
which is why I wanna kick your ass.

258
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,677
[all laughing]

259
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:25,763
If I win,

260
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,723
you walk away from Riverdale.

261
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:28,891
If you win,

262
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:30,976
the town's yours.

263
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,019
Win what?

264
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,062
A boxing match.

265
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:34,396
El Royale.

266
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,108
Or are you too weak, after being shot?

267
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,486
Everyone is saying that you've gone soft.

268
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,492
There is nothing soft about me,

269
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,035
and you know I don't lose.

270
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,162
We'll see about that.

271
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,671
[Veronica] Really, Daddy? A boxing match?

272
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,256
Archie challenged me to this fight

273
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,091
in the presence
of some business associates.

274
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,759
I couldn't look weak, Veronica.

275
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,511
-Well, you're not gonna win this.
-Says who?

276
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:06,428
Says me.

277
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,138
And all the odds-makers.

278
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,224
What? People are betting on this?

279
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,642
I've already gotten calls.

280
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:12,726
The underworld's abuzz,

281
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,562
asking if I'm taking bets
at La Bonne Nuit.

282
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,313
Obviously, I don't want any part of it.

283
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,773
Whoa, wait. You said no?

284
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:23,153
Mija, you could make some money off this.

285
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:25,948
Maybe.

286
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,993
I mean, I do still have that debt to you.

287
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,411
Yes, you do.

288
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:33,622
So, it's settled.  We'll run
all the betting through La Bonne Nuit.

289
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,959
I'll reach out to some friends.
Everyone will want a piece of the action.

290
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,127
It's a win-win.

291
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,795
And, Veronica, make no mistake,

292
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,088
I will win.

293
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,012
[Polly] I'm proud of you, Betty.

294
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,514
It takes courage to face your demons.

295
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,059
Did your darker half mention the time
you pushed me down the stairs?

296
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,730
Because I forgave you for that years ago.

297
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:07,656
JB?

298
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,784
Do you know where your pal Ricky is?

299
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,661
Is he in trouble?

300
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,082
Ricky's been working
for the Gargoyle King.

301
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,793
It's putting a lot of people's lives
in danger.

302
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,718
Ricky's in Fox Forest,

303
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:30,346
getting ready to ascend,
whatever that means.

304
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,556
Where? Do you know?

305
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,600
I need you to draw me a map. Right now.

306
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:57,957
Tell me, Betty.

307
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,292
Why have you chosen to return?

308
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:01,710
To see her again.

309
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,713
My other half.

310
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,299
I need to know what she wants.

311
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,578
[Shadow Betty] Did you miss me, Betty?

312
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,664
Don't worry.

313
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,959
Soon, the one will become many,

314
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,377
and the many, one.

315
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:48,590
And you can finally be your truest self.

316
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,887
And what is that?

317
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,223
My truest self?

318
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,393
You're a killer.

319
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,520
Just like Dad.

320
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,732
And it's time that you embrace that.

321
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,202
Come on, Ricky.

322
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:18,662
Where are you?

323
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,002
[Jughead] Ricky.

324
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,004
You... You shouldn't be here.

325
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:28,630
No.

326
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,132
What did you do?

327
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,428
Listen, kid. I'm taking you back
to civilization, all right?

328
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:35,512
I don't want to.

329
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:39,016
I've played this game.
I know it makes you do some crazy things.

330
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,685
But I need you alive,
because we're gonna end this together.

331
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,271
We answer to no one but our King.

332
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:46,190
"We"?

333
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:50,736
[Ricky] Kill him.

334
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:53,781
-Protect the princess.
-Princess?

335
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,157
[all shouting]

336
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,434
[Ethel] Hellcaster?

337
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,395
Princess Etheline?

338
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,606
Help me, Jughead Jones.

339
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,483
You're my only hope.

340
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,409
What are you doing down here?

341
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:43,122
Hiding from the Gargoyle King. I'm...

342
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,750
I'm terrified he's gonna kill me
for failing in my mission.

343
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,585
Mission? What mission?

344
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,090
Wait.

345
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:56,635
You were the one that told Ricky
to send that letter during prom?

346
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:57,803
[scoffs]

347
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,973
You led Betty right to the Gargoyle King
and the Black Hood?

348
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:02,724
I thought you quit G&G,

349
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,977
after Betty saved you
from the Sisters of Quiet Mercy.

350
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,647
She saved me from the Sisters' false King,

351
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:09,982
yes, but...

352
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:13,819
then I rejoined the true King
in the woods after...

353
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,947
When I came back to him,
he put me in charge of his Lost Boys.

354
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,448
That Lord of the Flies gang

355
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:21,368
that just chased me
through the woods with spears?

356
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:22,953
Ethel, you're playing G&--?

357
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:23,871
All right.

358
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:28,417
You're gonna tell me now,
right now, who the Gargoyle King is.

359
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,501
I can't.

360
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,836
I can't betray his trust.

361
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:33,797
Even when you just said
he's trying to kill you?

362
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:35,841
He's...

363
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,426
He's beautiful.

364
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:39,803
Despite it all,

365
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,264
I love him.

366
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:49,563
It's okay.

367
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:52,107
But you and the Lost Boys can't stay
in these woods.

368
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,525
You have to end this game.

369
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,528
Will you?

370
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,450
[Ethel sobs]

371
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,833
I asked you here because
I'm pulling off my biggest con yet,

372
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,753
and I need my best con man for the job.

373
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:17,633
Haven't we learned our lesson
about mixing business with pleasure?

374
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:21,345
Mm. The business is taking down my father.

375
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,097
So, are you in?

376
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,767
For old times' sake?

377
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,062
How could I resist?

378
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,773
[Kevin] What's this emergency, Betty?

379
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,025
Okay.

380
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:39,905
Edgar Evernever is hypnotizing us.

381
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:43,951
So?

382
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:46,411
Hypnotherapy is
a standard therapeutic practice

383
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,788
that people pay good money for.

384
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,790
And whatever Edgar is doing works.

385
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:52,251
-He took my pain away.
-I can't wait for him to take mine.

386
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,418
[Betty] But that's just it.

387
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:57,756
I think that he's purposely
inflicting pain on you during hypnosis.

388
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,385
Okay. Now you just sound cuckoo-pants.

389
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,554
Why would Edgar cause us pain,
just to take it away?

390
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:05,555
I don't know.

391
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,557
To have more power over you?

392
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,643
Edgar's our healer, Betty.

393
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,062
And do you have any proof to the contrary?

394
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,193
Right. Didn't think so.

395
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,195
Okay, bye.

396
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,825
I'll get you proof, Cheryl.

397
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,577
[Ethel] Stand down, Lost Boys.

398
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,413
The Hellcaster is on our side.

399
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,957
And he's come bearing good news.
Our quest is complete.

400
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,127
Where's Ricky?

401
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,461
He just took off.

402
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:39,965
He's probably reporting back
to the Gargoyle King or the Black Hood.

403
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,466
[sighs]

404
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,051
Jack? Where's Jack?

405
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,762
He went back to the bus
to get his carving knife.

406
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:48,307
We can't leave Jack behind.
He's the youngest.

407
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:51,768
Okay, I'll find him.

408
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,604
He's never gonna trust you on your own.

409
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:55,939
Then come on.

410
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:11,204
What is all this, Evelyn?

411
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,751
Is this one
of your dad-husband's treatments?

412
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,003
This is dialysis, Betty.

413
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:21,840
I was very unwell as a child.
My kidneys failed when I was little.

414
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:23,925
Hmm.

415
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:30,640
"Immuno..."

416
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:34,102
Wait, why are you on anti-rejection meds?

417
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:39,232
Which is what they give you
when you've had an organ transplant.

418
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:43,904
Not that it's any of your business,
but like I said, I was an ill child.

419
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,909
The scar on Kevin's back...

420
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,620

Oh, my God.

422
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,209
Edgar is...

423
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,504
butchering his disciples,

424
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,756

429
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,585
Maybe he's on the bus.

430
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:30,469
Jack, are you here?

431
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:33,889
I can't find my knife.

432
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,349
Okay, I'll get you a new one.
But right now we have to go.

433
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:38,226
Why'd you bring the Hellcaster?

434
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:39,811
It's okay, you can trust him.

-Go. Go.

Stay back.

We have to go.

and La Bonne Nuit,

560

Maybe you should ask her what she thinks.

Excuse me, Mr. Jones,
but where are the Lost Boys?

577

We've assigned a deputy to them.

According to Ethel,

Jason Blossom is the Gargoyle King.

definitively.

Dr. Curdle Junior proud.

is an organ farm.

in the infirmary,
