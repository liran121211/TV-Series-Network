00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:11,303
- [narrator] <i>Previously on</i> Riverdale:
- Ben and I thought it was a game.

2
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:13,013
But it's not. It's so much more.

3
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:15,098
- He's real. The Gargoyle King.
- Dilton?

4
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:19,061
Ben. Hey.

5
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:23,065
Framing Archie for murder,
conspiring to keep him locked away?

6
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:25,192
You don't have a daughter anymore.

7
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:26,944
We start a version of the Farm.

8
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,530
You're actually buying this Farm crap

9
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:32,282
that a huckster named
Edgar Evernever is selling you.

10
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:33,825
[Alice] Oh, my God.

11
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:35,410
- Betty.
- I didn't kill anyone.

12
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:37,913
<i>But I could've.
I have to take responsibility.</i>

13
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:40,123
I can't put everyone through this again.

14
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:42,334
<i>I'll take the deal.
Your Honor, I'm guilty.</i>

15
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:45,504
[school bell ringing]

16
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:47,631
[Jughead] <i>We've all felt it.</i>

17
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,466
<i>The first day of a new school year.</i>

18
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,677
<i>Butterflies in the stomach.</i>

19
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,513
<i>We've all looked around, and wondered,</i>

20
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,557
<i>where will I fit in here?</i>

21
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:58,850
<i>Who will I sit with at lunch?</i>

22
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:05,274
<i>Will I even make it till lunch?</i>

23
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:13,490
<i>Multiply that by a thousand,
and that's how Archie Andrews felt</i>

24
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:14,908
<i>as he was being processed</i>

25
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:18,412
<i>at the Leopold & Loeb
Juvenile Detention Center.</i>

26
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,791
Andrews. Warden wants to see you.
Let's go.

27
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,221
It's Shakespeare. Know what it means?

28
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:37,764
No, sir.

29
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:40,809
Means you're alone
and have no one to blame but yourself.

30
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:42,477
I read your file.

31
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:45,981
Besides killing that
boy at Shadow Lake...

32
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:49,318
I'm told you have an affinity for music.

33
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,111
We have a music room.

34
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,155
No one uses it, but it's there.

35
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:56,533
I keep an orderly house, Mr. Andrews.

36
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:59,703
Respect that, and we'll
get on just fine.

37
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,789
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.

38
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,128
I just got off the phone with the warden
at juvenile hall.

39
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,005
He says Archie's been processed.

40
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:12,215
- He's okay.
- Oh, thank God.

41
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:16,678
Yeah. They got a line on those three thugs
that gave false testimony against him.

42
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:19,056
I'm friends with the sheriff
at Shadow County.

43
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,224
He found a campfire in the deep woods.

44
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:24,561
Archie's in jail,
and these cretins are basically camping.

45
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,647
Not for long. We'll make sure of that.

46
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,733
Meanwhile I'll keep the home
fires burning at Riverdale High

47
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:33,904
so everyone knows my Archiekins
will be back in time for Homecoming.

48
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,657
And everything will be
just as he left it.

49
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,409
Dr. Patel kept Betty overnight
for observation,

50
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,244
but it was just a precaution.

51
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,330
Did he say what caused the seizure?

52
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:47,626
They ran tests, but he suspects
it's just good old-fashioned stress.

53
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:51,922
Oh, Betty.
I was up all night with the twins.

54
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,925
- We were so worried about you.
- You were worried about me?

55
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,803
And Juniper and Dagwood?
Are they all right?

56
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,346
Okay, here we go again.

57
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,307
Juniper and Dagwood are napping.
They're fine.

58
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,434
Why wouldn't they be?

59
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,899
Um, because I saw you and Mom throw the
twins into a giant bonfire last night.

60
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,067
Right, that's enough.

61
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,654
The only thing burning last night
was the hibachi in the backyard.

62
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,073
- We made skewers with friends.
- From the Farm?

63
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,449
Yeah, as a matter of fact.

64
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,577
You must've had a hallucination
while you had the seizure.

65
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,127
It was so real.

66
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:32,629
Sweetheart.

67
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,506
[cell phone buzzing]

68
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,428
[Betty] <i>My God.</i>

69
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,012
- Dilton is dead?
- Yeah.

70
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:44,516
And Ben from the drive-in?
He's barely hanging on.

71
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,352
Doctors don't know when,
or if, he's even gonna wake up.

72
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:50,897
Sheriff Minetta asked me
to keep it hush-hush for the families,

73
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:52,649
but, Betty, what I saw was...

74
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,777
- What, Jug?
- It was like a ritual site.

75
00:03:56,695 --> 00:04:01,032
Their lips were blue. There were chalices,
that were filled with poison or something.

76
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:04,536
Animal bones were in a circle.
The tree had markings on it.

77
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:07,247
There was a winged totem,
with a skull and branches.

78
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,541
Was it a murder
or a suicide pact gone wrong?

79
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:12,210
I have no idea. I saw Ben and Dilton.

80
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:13,920
Playing a weird game at Pop's.

81
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,840
Dilton was raving
about someone called the Gargoyle King.

82
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:22,471
I was also thinking that maybe you and
I could investigate this together.

83
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:27,434
For old times' sake. Or at least until
we catch a new lead with Archie's case.

84
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:30,562
I like that idea.

85
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:36,818
I'll try to see if Dr. Curdle can get us
into the coroner's office.

86
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:39,404
Have more romantic words
ever been spoken?

87
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:40,405
No.

88
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,575
[man] You bunk with Mad Dog.

89
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:44,576
[inmates shouting]

90
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,752
[jazz music playing on speakers]

91
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,045
Hey.

92
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,672
I'm Archie. You're Mad Dog, right?

93
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:58,965
[exhaling sharply]

94
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,316
How long you been in?

95
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,032
[music stops]

96
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,170
- Listen, since we're cellmates...
- Nice shoes.

97
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:40,215
I'd keep them tied real tight.

98
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:52,811
Mr. Weatherbee? As Archie's girlfriend,
and former running mate,

99
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:56,648
I wanted to let you know I'm stepping in
as interim student body president.

100
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:59,609
Sorry, someone else already petitioned
to be president.

101
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,320
- Just this morning.
- What? Who did?

102
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:08,285
Cheryl, what do you think you're doing,
trying to steal Archie's presidency?

103
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,954
Who would you have lead us
through these dark times?

104
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,123
Ethel Muggs? I saw the
poor girl earlier.

105
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,250
She was fuguing about a winged creature

106
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,002
- that was after her.
- Actually...

107
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,337
I thought I'd keep Archie's seat warm.

108
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:24,384
Why? When JFK was shot,
Jackie O. didn't become president.

109
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,594
Lyndon B. Johnson did.

110
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,888
And then he lead us into Vietnam.

111
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:29,973
I'm just saying.

112
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,894
Her man's in the big house, Cheryl.
Give her a break.

113
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:38,899
I get it. And I sympathize,
up to a point.

114
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:40,567
But let's be reals, Veronica.

115
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,986
I need this presidency
for college applications

116
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,321
a lot more than Archie.

117
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:08,803
You mind if I sit?

118
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,146
I'm Slash.

119
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:20,857
Who gave you that ink?

120
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,776
- Looks fresh.
- FP Jones did.

121
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,364
His son, Jughead, made me a Serpent.
Said I could hang out with you guys.

122
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,866
[Joaquin] You're no Serpent, Archie.

123
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,704
Joaquin.
What the hell are you doing in juvie?

124
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,916
Didn't you hear?
I came to town to help Fangs escape,

125
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,501
stuck around.

126
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,170
Got hauled in during Riot Night.

127
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:47,384
I know this guy, Slash.
He's Mr. Clean-Cut, All-American.

128
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,344
You're Jughead's pal, not a Serpent.

129
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:53,640
You have to earn our trust and
protection, with a test of loyalty.

130
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:55,892
See that Ghoulie?

131
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,313
I want you to go up to him...

132
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:03,775
and shiv him.

133
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,946
Don't worry about the guards.
We pay them to turn a blind eye.

134
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:12,826
Do that,
and then we'll have your back, huh?

135
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:13,952
You're kidding, right?

136
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,585
Not gonna happen, bro.

137
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,463
I don't need your protection that bad.

138
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:29,592
[inmate] Nice shoes.

139
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,261
[inmates whistling]

140
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,350
Dr. Curdle?

141
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:41,813
- Oh. You're not...
- I'm his son.

142
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:45,775
We spoke over the phone earlier.
I took over after my father passed away.

143
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,403
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Do you have the money?

144
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,412
The toxicology report revealed

145
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:00,123
lethal levels of cyanide
in Mr. Doiley's blood.

146
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,460
I surmise the surviving boy
didn't drink enough to finish the job.

147
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:07,213
Dr. Curdle, if you had to guess,
murder or suicide?

148
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:10,592
Well, the body did show signs of stress.

149
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:15,138
Three symbols carved out on his back.
Runic, I'd say.

150
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,431
Mind if I get a shot of this?

151
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,979
What caused, uh... the blue lips?

152
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:26,149
The cyanide was mixed
into a sugary drink called Fresh-Aid.

153
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:27,859
Blueberry-flavored.

154
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,572
There's something dimly familiar
about this.

155
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:35,658
But you asked me before
if I thought this was murder,

156
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,035
or suicide.

157
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:40,663
I'm not sure what it is,
but whatever it is,

158
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,583
it's darker
than what happened to Jason Blossom,

159
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:45,543
or what the Black Hood did.

160
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:48,296
No, what we're looking
at here, I believe,

161
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:50,965
is the true face of evil.

162
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,421
[playing blues tune]

163
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,644
- What's up, guys?
- You don't remember us?

164
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,187
Should I? Have we met before?

165
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:49,482
We were at the drag race
the day you called the cops on us.

166
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:50,775
We're in because of you.

167
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:52,610
Ghoulies.

168
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:53,778
Crap.

169
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,030
Look, I don't want any trouble.
I'm sorry.

170
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,117
Neither do we. We just want your shoes.

171
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,452
What?

172
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:04,914
Don't touch his face.

173
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,004
Why are you sitting that way?

174
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,964
I'm just a little sore, Ronnie.

175
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,340
Sore from what?

176
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,135
Working out. There's an amazing gym.

177
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,136
Uh-huh.

178
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,056
And where are your shoes?

179
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:25,518
The warden took them when I got here,
with my other clothes.

180
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,187
- That makes no sense.
- Ronnie.

181
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,063
Talk to me about school.

182
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,108
What am I missing?
How's the speakeasy coming?

183
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:33,860
It's coming.

184
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,112
What's it like,
being president in my place?

185
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:42,493
Hi, I'm checking in on the status
of a friend of mine, Ben Button.

186
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:47,290
Oh. Wait, he's out of the ICU?

187
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,917
That's great.

188
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,252
Uh, what time are your visiting hours?

189
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,005
Uh, thank you.

190
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:57,133
[Betty sighs]

191
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,593
Hi.

192
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,054
I'm Evelyn. And you're Betty Cooper?

193
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,847
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

194
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:06,100
Not exactly. We almost met,
through your mom and sister.

195
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,396
- They're studying with my dad.
- Edgar Evernever.

196
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,648
Yeah. That's right.

197
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,317
Anyway, I go to school here now.
I wanted to say hi,

198
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,946
let you know I won't tell anyone
about what happened the other night.

199
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:21,032
- What are you talking about?
- Your seizure, of course.

200
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,869
Wait, sorry, you...? You were there?

201
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:28,623
Your mom invited us over for a cookout,
and to burn a few of her things.

202
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:30,500
How are you feeling?

203
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,503
Uh... [chuckles]

204
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,171
Um...

205
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:39,259
Uh, you know what, Evelyn? I have to go.

206
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:42,387
I have to visit a
friend in the hospital.

207
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,304
So...

208
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:45,473
Yeah, no worries. I totally understand.

209
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,816
- Dude, what are you doing?
- What we've done all summer.

210
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,110
I thought we'd sneak off
to the boiler room...

211
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,611
My dad is right over there.

212
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:02,490
Why?

213
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,326
He's the new RROTC instructor.

214
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,786
He's making me sign up.

215
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:10,081
If he's around school,
we have to take it easy.

216
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,708
Hey, Cadet Mason.

217
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,294
On time is late. Let's go. Room 302.

218
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,134
Talk to you later.

219
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,221
[school bell ringing]

220
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:26,931
[pop music playing on speakers]

221
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,237
Veronica.

222
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,947
That's right, you work here now.

223
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:45,033
Cherry phosphate and curly fries. Girls?

224
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:47,368
I don't work at Pop's, Cheryl. I own it.

225
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,871
And as of this moment,
you're no longer welcome.

226
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:53,374
You can't discriminate against someone
'cause they're better-looking.

227
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,878
Cheryl, you're acting like trash,
and I don't wanna get a citation.

228
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,338
[sighs]

229
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,215
Vixens, leave us be.

230
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,304
Now, then.

231
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,098
What are you mad about?

232
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:12,018
It can't be that I'm making a play
for student body president.

233
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,187
Actually, that's exactly why I'm mad.

234
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,564
I promised Archie that when he gets out,

235
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,649
I'll have everything in place, waiting.

236
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,777
That includes this stupid presidency.

237
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,154
Just a suggestion,
but maybe channel that rage

238
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:26,783
into something more productive,
like getting your boyfriend sprung.

239
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:31,245
There's an organization
called the Innocence Project.

240
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:34,040
Looked into it when I was accused
of Jay-Jay's murder.

241
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,625
Maybe check it out.

242
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,045
A little food for thought.

243
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,048
Speaking of food, cancel my order.

244
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:44,133
I'm going to TGI Thursdays.

245
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:53,309
[woman on PA] <i>Dr. Matthews
to Pediatrics.</i>

246
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:02,944
[EKG beeping]

247
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,739
Hi, Mrs. Button.

248
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:11,536
- We wanted to see how Ben was doing.
- How do you know my Ben?

249
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:15,289
Uh... From school. And he and I worked
at the Twilight Drive-In.

250
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:16,290
Oh.

251
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:19,460
How he's doing?

252
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:21,963
He's stabilized,
but he hasn't woken up yet.

253
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:25,925
Do you know what happened
in the woods, Mrs. Button?

254
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:30,138
No. Ben's always been a bit
of an odd duck, you could say.

255
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:33,683
Kept to himself. Especially after
his piano teacher was murdered.

256
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,894
But this summer, he
became friends with...

257
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:37,979
Dilton Doiley.

258
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:41,315
That's right.
It's like he became a different person.

259
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,570
Secretive, sneaking out at all hours.

260
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,156
Having these horrible nightmares.

261
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:49,782
Mrs. Button.

262
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,412
Know what this is, or how it got here?

263
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,414
Maybe that nice girl left it.

264
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:58,583
Someone else came to visit Ben?

265
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,126
Another friend from school.

266
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:03,296
I don't remember her name.
She wore a bow in her hair.

267
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,801
Jughead, Betty.

268
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:11,345
I don't care how Keller ran things
when he was sheriff.

269
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:15,224
I won't let a couple teenagers compromise
an active murder investigation.

270
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,518
If it's an active murder investigation,

271
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,562
start by letting
the rest of the town know.

272
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:20,480
Sheriff Minetta?

273
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,650
- What, Henderson?
- An Adventure Scout's parents called.

274
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,694
- Haven't seen him in two days.
- What?

275
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:30,072
We've got a missing kid. And he was
part of Dilton Doiley's troop.

276
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,792
- [Veronica] Madam Mayor.
- Wait, why are you not in school?

277
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:44,795
I'm on my way, but this couldn't wait.

278
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:49,091
I'm starting a chapter of the
Innocence Project here in Riverdale

279
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,427
and with a letter of support
from Town Hall,

280
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,763
I can cut through all
that silly red tape.

281
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,516
I can't get in this war
between you and your father.

282
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:59,519
But I'm not here as your daughter.
I'm here as a citizen.

283
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,523
One of your constituents
sits in juvenile detention,

284
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:07,276
wrongfully convicted,
and I intend to get him acquitted.

285
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:08,861
[Veronica sighs]

286
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:12,073
Your endorsement could help sway
a lot of dubious minds.

287
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:13,741
Please, Mom.

288
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,037
Fine.

289
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,790
- I'll have Gloria draft a letter.
- Wonderful.

290
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,043
Oh, and I'm also accepting donations.

291
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:27,672
[Jughead] Hi, Ethel.

292
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,841
- Does this look familiar to you?
- Where'd you get it?

293
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,053
Ben's hospital room.

294
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:37,807
- Why were you there?
- I don't have to tell you anything.

295
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,517
- You're not police.
- Ethel, wait.

296
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,437
We're trying to find out what happened
to Ben, Dilton, and the missing Scout.

297
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,481
- Is it the Gargoyle King?
- How do you know?

298
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,900
Dilton started to tell me,
but only got so far.

299
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:49,610
So, is it?

300
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,946
No. No.

301
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:52,947
It's the opposite.

302
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:56,492
I made that talisman
to... To protect Ben.

303
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:59,662
- How do you even know Ben?
- He's my boyfriend.

304
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:03,958
- I've never seen you two together.
- We started dating this summer.

305
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,336
- We spent all our time in the bunker.
- Bunker?

306
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:10,131
Never mind.

307
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,048
Ethel, just...

308
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,175
What bunker?

309
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,179
Dilton's.

310
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:18,097
In the woods.

311
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:21,142
Dilton Doiley has a secret bunker
in the woods?

312
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,729
It was our secret spot.

313
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,983
- And Dilton's, too.
- Can you at least tell us where it is?

314
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,860
I mean, I can't.

315
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,278
It's too hard to describe.

316
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,405
Then can you show us where it is?

317
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:38,492
Ethel, it's either us
or Sheriff Minetta.

318
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,537
Okay, fine.
But you have to keep it a secret.

319
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:42,663
- Sure.
- Of course.

320
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:44,874
And go at night, so nobody can see us.

321
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,542
Know where Fox Footbridge is?

322
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:55,843
I tried to warn you.

323
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:57,303
Yeah.

324
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,808
Apparently,
the Ghoulies really like sneakers.

325
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,268
You're a Serpent.

326
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:07,855
- Why didn't they look out for you?
- I wouldn't shiv a Ghoulie.

327
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:13,986
How come?

328
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,322
Because that's not who I am.

329
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:18,949
Maybe not yet.

330
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,452
But you will be soon.

331
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:24,163
When you got here, you
lost your humanity.

332
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,082
You're an animal in a cage now.

333
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,417
An animal does whatever he has to do
to live.

334
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:31,379
- To survive.
- What do you do, Mad Dog?

335
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,006
You're not a Ghoulie.
You're not a Serpent.

336
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,509
I doubt anyone in here messes with you.

337
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:39,637
You have stuff no other prisoner does.
Why?

338
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:41,472
You don't wanna know.

339
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,975
And trust me, you don't
wanna get tapped.

340
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:46,811
But take my advice this time.

341
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,270
Be an animal.

342
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:51,190

515
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,220
I wonder if Ethel was playing with them.

516
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:10,892
Jug.

517
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:15,272
Is it the thing
that came at us last night?

518
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:16,940
Yeah, the Gargoyle King?

519
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,609
He's also featured on this copper coin.

520
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:23,530
Betty.

521
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:27,492
Oh, God.

522
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:31,413
"Drink from the correct cup."

523
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:32,956
Blue lips, cyanide.

524
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,042
It was a challenge.

525
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:37,210
Part of that stupid
game they're playing.

526
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:41,381
Pick the chalice that's not poisoned,
and...

527
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:43,842
win, I guess?

528
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:45,927
So, it was suicide?

529
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:47,387
Maybe.

530
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,515
Or something even more insidious.

531
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,279
[screaming]

532
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:09,242
- Know how worried your folks are?
- Doesn't matter.

533
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:11,995
I'm supposed to hide,
until Master Doiley comes back.

534
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:15,165
Jeez.

535
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:19,336
Kid, haven't you heard?
Dilton's not coming back.

536
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:22,214
- That's a lie.
- [Betty] No. It's not.

537
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:24,883
Dilton is...

538
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:26,885
dead.

539
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,513
I'm sorry.

540
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:32,849
You played Gryphons & Gargoyles
with Dilton?

541
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:36,645
I was his apprentice. He was teaching me
so I could join the game.

542
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,648
With Ben Button,
and Ben's girlfriend Ethel Muggs?

543
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:43,568
Yes, but Princess Etheline isn't dating
Ben in real life, only in the game.

544
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,780
She warned me two enemies
might invade the bunker.

545
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,281
Okay, well, game's over.

546
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:50,283
All right?
I'm gonna get you back to your folks.

547
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:53,120
Then we need to pay another visit
to Princess Etheline.

548
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:56,206

[groans]

553
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,686
- Not so fun without the pads, huh?
- No, this is great.

554
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:21,731
Holy hell.
It's about to get a whole lot better.

[chuckles]

556
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:36,830

557
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:38,248
That's my girl.

Why are you here?

Warden Norton is a friend,
and a business associate.

585
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:12,592
He told me about this little game,
and invited me to come see it.

586
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:16,096
- And you had nothing better to do.
- As disrespectful as you're being,

I won't let you flush your life
down the drain for a boy, a criminal.

588

And I think you'll find that after today,
you won't be allowed to visit Archie.

589
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:24,563
I get it.

590
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:26,606
Warden Norton is in your pocket.

591
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,483
Everyone is in your pocket.

Where's Mad Dog? His stuff?

612
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:12,295
Oh, you didn't hear?
Mad Dog died in the riot.

613
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:14,547
The one you started.

614
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,802
No, that's impossible.
Mad Dog wasn't even there.

615
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:33,233
- It'll never end with him, will it?
- Daddy Dearest, you mean?

616
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,568
He's obsessed
with keeping me and Archie apart.

617
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,862
I can't even go visit him anymore.

618
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:41,074
Apparently he put my name
on a do-not-admit list.

619
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:41,991
Get a new name.

620
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:47,080
Before leaving on my iconic road trip
to California with Toni,

621
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:49,874
Reggie got us fake IDs,
to get into the Viper Room.

622
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,126
He'd hook you up, too.

623
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:57,674
You blew us off, Ethel.

624
00:36:57,757 --> 00:37:01,511
And you knew where the missing Scout
was, and didn't say anything to anyone.

625
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:05,265
- Also, you and Ben aren't really dating.
- Yes, we are. We're in love.

626
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,809
No, Ethel, you were playing a game.
Role-playing.

627
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,227
That's what you don't get.

628
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,312
It was more real than you'll understand.

629
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:14,482
Ethel, we're trying to help you,
but you have to stop lying.

630
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,025
- I'm not lying.
- Okay.

631
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:18,445
Let's go to the sheriff's station.

632
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:21,114
You can put that truth on record
to Sheriff Minetta.

633
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:25,160
Look, if any of us talk to any grown-ups,
he's gonna get very, very angry.

634
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,536
Who, Ethel?

635
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,288
Look what happened to Dilton.

636
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,081

638
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:34,586

Oh, my God.

640
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:39,174
- She's having a seizure.
- Call an ambulance.

641
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,467
- Weatherbee!
- Ethel.

642
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,051
It's okay.

- Help is coming, okay?
- Yeah, hi. Uh...

00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:49,225
We have a girl that's having a seizure,
at Riverdale High. Send an ambulance.

You've got ten minutes.

646
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:08,661
Hello, Archie.

647
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:11,289
My name is Monica Posh.

648
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:14,000
I'm with Riverdale's chapter
of the Innocence Project

649
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,753
I'll be working
to get you out of this place.

650
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:23,384
Welcome, Cadets, to the RROTC.

651
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:24,552
Excuse me, Major Mason?

652
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:28,765
My name's Kevin Keller.
Hope it's not too late to join.

653
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,767
Keller. You Tom Keller's boy?

654
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,143
- I am, sir.
- [Mason] Hell.

655
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:35,563
Tom and I were in the RROTC together,
back in the day.

656
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:38,566
Come on in, son.
Take a seat. We'll get started.

657
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:49,994
[man] Open it.

658
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:01,673
You caused quite the
commotion in my yard.

659
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:04,217
You sent three of my
men to the infirmary.

660
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,552
Where's Mad Dog, warden?

661
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:08,221
Captain Golightly said he died
in the riot,

662
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,056
when he wasn't even there.

663
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:11,307
What did you do to him?

664
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:16,104
Save that righteous anger, young man.

665
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,522
You're going to need it.

666
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,234
You impressed me today.

667
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:24,195
- Proved you have what it takes.
- What's happening?

668
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:25,238
You've been tapped.

669
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:27,991
You're gonna be my new Mad Dog.

670
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,582
Some of you know why we're here.

671
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,751
And some of us are sworn enemies.

672
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:41,004
But we made a vow in high school.

673
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:43,882
Now that the Scout is back,
safe and sound, thank God...

674
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:46,593
we can only assume
that he'll start talking,

675
00:39:46,676 --> 00:39:49,053
and that whatever he says
might lead back to us.

676
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,641
To the secret that we buried,
all those years ago.

677
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:55,310
Why are you talking about this?

678
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:59,105
This hasn't been made public yet, Fred,
but Dilton Doiley and Ben Button...

679
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,775
were found in the woods with blue lips.

680
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:05,904
Dilton is dead.

681
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:08,364
Ben is in a coma.

682
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,868
Don't you keep Sheriff Minetta
on a short leash?

683
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:15,163
- Can't you just make this all go away?
- We control Minetta, yes.

684
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,248
- Jughead found the body.
- That's the concern.

685
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:20,126
We talked with Jughead and Betty,
told them to stop.

686
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:22,170
But you know how crazy our kids can be.

687
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,422
We made a pact
to never revisit that night.

688
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,883
Not to mention it,
not to even think about it.

689
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:30,261
- My vote is we stick to that.
- We might not have that luxury, Tom.

690
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:33,431
Not if it's happening again.
Not if it's our children.

691
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:35,892
All our children.

692
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:38,394
They're in danger.

693
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,191
[Betty] <i>Mrs. Muggs said Ethel's resting.</i>

694
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:46,027
It just doesn't make sense, Jug.

695
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:50,406
It can't be a coincidence,
but seizures aren't contagious.

696
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,951
So... what? What is it?

697
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,621
Sounds like another mystery
for us to solve.

698
00:40:58,247 --> 00:40:59,248
If you're up for it.

699
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:01,376
I am.

700
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:03,836
And maybe it's the same one.

701
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,715
Maybe there's a connection
between the seizures

702
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:09,801
and whatever happened to Dilton, and...

703
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,429
Do you wanna check on Ben
while we're here?

704
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:19,852
Ben?

705
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:21,854
[Jughead] Ben.

706
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:25,316
Hey, what are you doing?
Come away from the window.

707
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,318
It's okay. Everything's okay.

708
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:28,569
I know.

709
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:32,198
I know it is.
I'm gonna be with Dilton now.

710
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:34,117
We both flipped the coin.

711
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,036
He was scared to ascend, but I'm not.

712
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:40,456
What about...?
What about your Princess Etheline, huh?

713
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,541
We'll be reunited.

714
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:43,418
In the Kingdom.

715
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,461
One day, all of us will.

716
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:46,921
It's all part of his plan.

717
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:48,297
- You'll see.
- Ben.

718
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:49,966
Soon.

719
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:52,885
- You'll fly, too.
- [Betty] Ben, no!

720
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:55,638
[glass breaking, car alarm wailing]
