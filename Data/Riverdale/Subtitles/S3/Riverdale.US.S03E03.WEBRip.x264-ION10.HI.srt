00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:09,718
[narrator] <i>Previously on </i>Riverdale:

2
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:13,304
Dilton Doiley and Ben Button were found
in the woods with blue lips.

3
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:15,807
We made a pact
to never revisit that night.

4
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,060
- Gryphons and Gargoyles.
- Wonder if Ethel was playing with them.

5
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:22,605
If any of us talk to any grownups,
he's gonna get very, very angry,

6
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,065
Who? The Gargoyle King?

7
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,358
[snarling]

8
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:28,111
- She's having a seizure.
- Ethel. Help is coming, okay?

9
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:30,822
We both flipped the coin.
He was scared to ascend.

10
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:32,615
But I'm not. Soon you'll fly, too.

11
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,743
- [Jughead] Ben, no! Ben!
- [Betty] Ben!

12
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,536
I'm Evelyn. You're Betty Cooper?

13
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:38,747
Your mom and your sister
study with my dad.

14
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,582
- From the Farm?
- Yeah, that's right.

15
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:41,624
Edgar Evernever.

16
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,918
I won't tell anyone
about the other night.

17
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,420
Oh, my God. Betty.

18
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:46,796
Stop the riot.

19
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:48,840
[Norton] You impressed me today.

20
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:51,468
You've been tapped.
You're gonna be my new Mad Dog.

21
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,846
[door opens]

22
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:58,892
[footsteps approaching]

23
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,648
Well?

24
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,400
Had time to think?

25
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:08,985
The answer is still no.

26
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,196
Then I'll see you in another week.

27
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,540
This feels right, doesn't it?

28
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:29,005
I'm glad the Farm, uh, opened you up
to the possibility of us.

29
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:31,299
[chuckles]

30
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,431
What are you thinking about, Alice?

31
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:39,891
It's been three weeks.

32
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:44,187
No more suicides, no more blue lips.

33
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,856
As far as the town's concerned,

34
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,234
it was just two boys
taking their own lives

35
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:50,318
for whatever reason.

36
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,238
Hopefully it ends there.

37
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,534
With Jughead and Betty on the case?

38
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,703
You know that's not likely.

39
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,124
Betty, what are you thinking about?

40
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:06,835
Do you think it's sort of...

41
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:12,132
ghoulish for us to be crashing
Dilton's bunker like this?

42
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:15,885
This bunker is the only place in town
we can get a modicum of privacy.

43
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,264
- My dad's watching me like a hawk.
- Same with my mom.

44
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:27,021
Ben's death haunts me, Jug.

45
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,316
He didn't scream.

46
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,903
Why not, I wonder.

47
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:37,699
Because that's one of the rules
of Gryphons and Gargoyles?

48
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,244
Betty, that's what we're missing.

49
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:45,582
There's no rulebook, no player's manual.
What if that's the key to all this?

50
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,501
Ethel, Ben, and Dilton talk about it
like a religion.

51
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:49,961
Yeah, or a cult.

52
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,922
And every cult has its king.

53
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,218
Sorry I kept you waiting, Mr. Andrews.

54
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,258
How can I help you? My son.

55
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:03,808
I wanna see him.

56
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:04,934
Today.

57
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,770
Your son is quite a firebrand.

58
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:09,898
He started a riot.

59
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,525
I'm afraid
his visitation privileges are suspended.

60
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,778
I was told by witnesses
that your guards started that riot.

61
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,448
That's a very serious accusation,
Mr. Andrews.

62
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:19,866
It's been three weeks.

63
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:23,828
I will decide when it is appropriate
for him to receive visitors again.

64
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:27,123
Was there anything else?

65
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:29,334
Yeah.

66
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,378
You'll be hearing from my lawyer.

67
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,487
[Veronica] <i>I'm in trouble here, Bee.</i>

68
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,176
I'm up to my eyebrows in bills.

69
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,886
Pop's is hemorrhaging money.

70
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:41,846
Well, how far along is the speakeasy?

71
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,056
Is it close, at least?

72
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:46,351
Vee, what?

73
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:47,518
What is it?

74
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:51,856
The speakeasy's ready.

75
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:55,985
- It has been for a while.
- What? Why haven't you opened it?

76
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,238
I've been waiting for Archie.

77
00:03:59,113 --> 00:03:59,948
I just...

78
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:05,203
I wanted him to be there,
dancing with me on opening night.

79
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:06,287
A part of it all.

80
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:12,210
This is exactly what Archie didn't want.

81
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:14,796
For you to just put your life on hold.

82
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,132
You need to focus on yourself
for a change.

83
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,760
I'm saying this to you as your friend.

84
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,595
Open the damn speakeasy.

85
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,268
Veronica says
she'll have a pretty strict dress code

86
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,152
at her speakeasy.

87
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:31,321
Of course we're
calling it a speakeasy.

88
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,856
And, uh, what are you getting at?

89
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,486
Hey, Ethel's back.

90
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,656
Yeah, she's talking
to that weirdo girl from the Farm.

91
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:44,659
Oh, my God.

92
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:48,371
What if the game is
connected to the Farm?

93
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,542
Ben, Dilton, and Ethel
started playing the game this summer,

94
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:56,129
which is when the Farm
and the Evernevers moved to Riverdale.

95
00:04:56,212 --> 00:05:00,174
Evelyn's dad, Edgar, is their leader.
My mom won't stop talking about him.

96
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,718
- He's like a kind of...
- King?

97
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,123
What do you know about
him and the Farm?

98
00:05:06,174 --> 00:05:07,357
Basically nothing.

99
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,270
- Should we start with Evelyn or Ethel?
- Ethel.

100
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,565
Evelyn... creeps me out.

101
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:18,484
Last time we talked to Ethel,
she had a seizure.

102
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,279
We'll be more gentle this time.

103
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,114
[Josie] <i>Hi, Pop.</i>

104
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:25,325
Looking for Veronica? This way.

105
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,204
Pick up the phone, dial 642.

106
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,327
[phone line dialing] -[Reggie] <i>Password.</i>
- I don't know.

107
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:40,882
Stonewall.

108
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,177
[Reggie] Close enough. Whoa.

109
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:50,808
[Josie chuckles]

110
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,311
- Come on in.
- [Josie] Oh, my God.

111
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:58,691
Oh, my God.

112
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:01,319
I died and went to
Kander and Ebb heaven.

113
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,237
Veronica.

114
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,572
Welcome to La Bonne Nuit.

115
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,535
I hired some Serpents from the Whyte
Wyrm to serve drinks. Mocktails only.

116
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,413
La Bonne Nuit is not in the business
of corrupting minors.

117
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,748
Not yet.

118
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:15,541
Josie.

119
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,126
I need star power.

120
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,296
I would love for you
to be my resident chanteuse.

121
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,297
Are you for real?

122
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,215
Mm-hm.

123
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,802
I have been working like whoa
to find my sound now that I'm solo,

124
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,012
and I haven't had
anywhere to test it out.

125
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:31,724
Ooh, this is the perfect opportunity.

126
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,936
And, Kevin,
I'd love for you to be our emcee.

127
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:37,021
So long as I can sing now and then.

128
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:38,689
But of course.

129
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,692
Or as we like to say at La Bonne Nuit,
<i>mais oui.</i>

130
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:43,611
[phone rings]

131
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,447
Hey, Pop. What's up?

132
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:51,953
[Veronica] <i>Penny Peabody.</i>

133
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,915
I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
Now, what the hell do you want?

134
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:59,210
[chuckles] No, no, no.
It's not what I want.

135
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,671
It's what you want.

136
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:02,922
Protection.

137
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,883
The Ghoulies are offering
their services...

138
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:07,718
for a modest price.

139
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:09,887
Let me guess.

140
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,931
Protection from you, right?

141
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:14,767
[Penny] It's a nice place you got here.

142
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:19,397
And... as above, so below, I'm guessing.

143
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,316
Maybe even nicer down there
in the speakeasy?

144
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,277
I'd hate for something bad
to happen to it.

145
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,279
Food for thought.

146
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,326
I'll let you chew on it.

147
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,840
Up and at 'em. We're going for a ride.

148
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,096
[boys grunting]

149
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,018
Welcome to the Pit.

150
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:05,985
Joaquin.

151
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:08,613
When you refused my offer,
I tapped a replacement.

152
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,948
I knew you were friends
with Mr. DeSantos.

153
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:14,994
As you can see, he's nearly reached
the end of his... usefulness.

154
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,372
Only you, Mr. Andrews,
can decide how he ends it.

155
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,374
Back in his cell, safe and sound.

156
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,752
Or in the infirmary on life support.

157
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,929
I'll do it. I'll take his place.

158
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,348
[crowd cheering]

159
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,026
[security alarm buzzes]

160
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,615
Andrews, meet the rest of the team.

161
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,082
The name's Baby Teeth.

162
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,638
May not look like much,
but I leave a mark.

163
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:05,545
That's Thumper,

164
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:06,462
and Peter. Archie.

165
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,927
You better start hitting this bag,
before the captain comes over.

166
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:18,891
Rules of the fight:

167
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,393
Bare knuckles till knockout.

168
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,103
Warden sells the tickets.

169
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,312
Guards place bets.

170
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:24,605
Everyone profits.

171
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:26,148
Except us.

172
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,150
Get perks if we win.

173
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:31,988
What happened to Mad Dog?

174
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:34,782
Quit the chatter.

175
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,327
Best you don't ask many questions.

176
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,626
Just the ladies I was looking for.

promoting La Bonne Nuit,

Ethel. Hi.

Are you eating alone?
Do you mind if we...?

190
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,672
The doctors put me on medication.

191
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,382
To stop the seizures.

192
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,386
I was having them multiple times a day.

193
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:38,888
It's very strong.

194
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:42,892
Look, if Betty and I did something
to trigger your seizures, we're sorry.

195

We were trying to help.

196

Ben, when he threw himself out a window?

Ethel...

198
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:55,363
when you collapsed,
did you have any visions?

199
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,616
I honestly don't remember.

200
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,159
Okay.

201
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,997
Well, how long have you been friends
with Evelyn Evernever?

202
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:06,832
Evelyn's the best.

203
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,752
She visited me in the hospital,
is helping me get better,

204
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,838
- so I can titrate down my meds.
- Was that her idea or her dad's?

205
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,591
Wait, have you met Mr. Evernever?

206

Weatherbee gave her permission

208

in the Kingdom.

214

This is a crazy question.

or a player's manual?

219

You mean the scripture?

220
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,714
Yes. That.

221
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,048
Do you own a copy?

222
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,342
I can't just tell you that, obviously.

Please? Princess Etheline.

224
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:04,014
Don't call me that.
You haven't earned that privilege.

225
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,758
You're not worthy of
the King's scripture.

226
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,017
Yes, but I wanna be.

227
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:10,563
I wanna be worthy.
Could you please show me how?

228
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,778
Meet me tomorrow night
at Dilton's bunker.

229

But... just you.

230
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:25,494
Sorry, Betty, but you'll never be
worthy, no matter how hard you try.

231

Well...
looks like you're on Ethel Muggs detail.

232

And I...

233
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,220
am in need of some serious peer support.

234

00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:45,642
<i>♪ Sing me, baby
La, da, da, da, da, da, da ♪</i>

353
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:54,943
[scoffs]

354
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:58,822
Ethel.

355
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,367
Welcome to your first game.

356
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,287
Your entry point to the realm
of Gryphons and Gargoyles.

357
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:06,788
The magical kingdom of Eldervair.

358
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:16,590
First things first.

359
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:21,136
Do you wanna be the Radiant Knight,
Arcane Invoker, or Hellcaster?

360
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:22,721
Uh, Hellcaster.

361
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,352
Good choice. That was Ben's avatar.

362
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,896
I was supposed to ascend with him,

363
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:33,607
but he betrayed me
and finished the game with Dilton.

364
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,026
Leaving you high and dry.

365
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,070
Doesn't matter.

366
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,989
Pick a Quest Card. Let's get started.

367
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:46,495
[Betty] <i>Mom?</i>

368
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,666
Why are all those cars parked outside?

369
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,876
Betty, please, join us.

370
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,794
Sit.

371
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,797
Evelyn told us you're ready
to meet the Farm.

372
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,803
I thought
Mr. Evernever would be joining us.

373
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:03,971
[all laughing]

374
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:06,723
No. You don't just meet Edgar.

375
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:11,103
There are certain levels that you need
to attain before meeting Edgar.

376
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:13,563
First you start by
meeting a few Farmies.

377
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,440
Today can be your first testimony.

378
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,025
Testimony?

379
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,819
It's just a conversation.

380
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:22,447
An open, nonjudgmental conversation

381
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,992
about all the bad things you've done
in your life.

382
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,120
What kind of stuff would
you like to know?

383
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:29,037
Everything.

384
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,081
Speak from your heart.

385
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:35,711
From what your mother and Polly told us,
we know you've been through so much.

386
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:39,881
Between your dark kinship with your
father and the role you played

387
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:43,343
in disposing of the dead body
in your kitchen.

388
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:44,970
Wait. What? What?

389
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:47,806
Mom. Wait, you...? You told the Farm

390
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,600
about Chic and the shady man?
Are you out of your mind?

391
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,854
Oh, everything that we talk about
at the Farm

392
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:56,148
is kept in confidence.

393
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,525
We know all each other's secrets.

394
00:21:58,650 --> 00:21:59,484
The wig.

395
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:01,611
The webcamming.

396
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:05,741
Okay. Okay.

397
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,368
If tonight's all about
open conversation,

398
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:11,705
then let's talk about how you,
Evelyn, were there

399
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:14,828
at both my seizure and Ethel's. And about
how the Farm showed up in Riverdale

400
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:19,296
at about the same time as a crazy game.

401
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,507
- Elizabeth, what are you talking about?
- It's a game.

402
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:26,970
It's called Gryphons and Gargoyles, that
made Ben and Dilton kill themselves,

403
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,057
all to appease some creature
called the Gargoyle King,

404
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,225
who, for all we know,
is Edgar Evernever.

405
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:36,063
The first time any of us heard
of Gryphons and Gargoyles

406
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:38,398
was from your mother, Betty.

407
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,359
How does that make any sense?

408
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,736
Mom, how do you know
about Gryphons and Gargoyles?

409
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:44,988
Betty. We're here to talk about you,

410
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:46,698
not your mother's past.

411
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,408
My mother's past?

412
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,243
You know, Evelyn, you were right.

413
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,621
It's too soon. Betty's not ready.

414
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:54,998
Mom.

415
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,124
You...

416
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,169
- You...
- Betty.

417
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:00,212
No. Don't touch me.

418
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:02,130
I'm fine.

419
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:09,012
Okay. You've crossed the old footbridge
to find two doors.

420
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,098
One is made of shimmering gold.

421
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:14,935
The other is just plain old maple wood.
Which door do you pick?

422
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:18,688
- Let's go with Door Number Two.
- Well-picked, Caster.

423
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:20,524
You've entered a secret chamber.

424
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:23,568
You're in the middle of a circle,
composed of gryphon bones.

425
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,365
Two chalices sit before you.

426
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:31,618
Ethel.

427
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,162
No. No way.

428
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,081
You wanted to prove your worthiness.

429
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:38,708
You have to drink
from one of the sacred goblets.

430
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,920
Like Ben and Dilton? You're asking
me to play Russian roulette.

431
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:43,630
To play Gryphons and Gargoyles.

432
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,795
Is there poison in
these Fresh-Aids?

433
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:48,398
That's gargoyle blood,
as you well know.

434
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,142
Flip for your fate.

435
00:23:58,854 --> 00:23:59,688
If I do this...

436
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:05,944
- you promise to give me the scripture?
- I promise.

437
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,737
The King as my witness.

438
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:19,541
Gryphon.

439
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,053
Salut.

440
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:41,563
How do you feel?

441
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,198
Okay... I think.

442
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:55,994
Hey, rulebook. Come on.

443
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:05,921
You have to kiss me first.

444
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,423
My God, Ethel. Are you serious?

445
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,633
It's in the scripture.

446
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:12,844
The Hellcaster kisses the princess
or doesn't get the treasure.

447
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,055
Fine.

448
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:23,522
- Is this the only one?
- That I'm aware of.

449
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:28,985
All right. It's all in here.

450
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,196
The characters...

451
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,909
[scoffs] Oh, Betty's gonna
lose her mind over this.

452
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:38,995
What are you doing? Put that down.

453
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,706
- You okay?
- Jughead.

454
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,543
Come on. Come on. I'm
gonna call you 911.

455
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:45,961
Jeez, come on. Come on.

456
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:56,805
[Ethel] Jughead?

457
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:00,809
- What happened?
- You're in the hospital.

458
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:04,729
You ingested poison,
but they got you the antidote in time,

459
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,064
so, you're gonna be okay.

460
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,193
Protocol for anyone on suicide watch.

461
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,278
Suicide watch?

462
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,281
- But I didn't try to...
- You did.

463
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,327
When your parents get here,
be honest with them.

464
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:22,372
- You have to tell them about this game.
- I can't.

465
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,084
I'll never tell them.

466
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,086
Neither will you. If you do,

467
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:30,049
- I'll say you mixed the Fresh-Aid.
- It's over.

468
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:31,506
This game.

469
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,258
Whatever game you were playing...

470
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:34,926
is over now, Ethel.

471
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:36,011
No.

472
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,013
It's only just beginning.

473
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,725
You've proven yourself, Hellcaster.

474
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,561
I told him.
I told him that you were worthy enough

475
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:46,062
- to spread his gospel.
- Who?

476
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,731
Don't be dumb.

477
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:49,566
The King, of course.

478
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,111
The King isn't going to
hurt anyone anymore.

479
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,489
I'll make sure this doesn't
end up in anyone else's hands.

480
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:57,407
Okay?

481
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,120
Thank you, Hellcaster,

482
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:04,039
for helping me finish my game.

483
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,437
All right, Daddy.
Cards on the table.

484
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:13,882
I'm not paying protection
money to anyone.

485
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,717
Not Penny, not Minetta,

486
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,844
- and especially not to you.
- Veronica.

487
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,765
A bit of advice,
from one entrepreneur to another:

488
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:25,101
Don't make enemies
of people trying to help you.

489
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:26,770
Help me? Okay.

490
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,148
Here's the deal.

491
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,692
You tell your lackeys to back off,

492
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:36,071
or I'll send these photographs
of your drug lab to the authorities

493
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,031
faster than you can say Heisenberg.

494
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:41,451
Hmm.

495
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:45,080
I doubt these will have much traction
with Minetta.

496
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,998
[chuckles] I won't go to Minetta.

497
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,375
I'll go to the FBI.

498
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:52,712
Oh, and also,
I want $10,000 a week in perpetuity.

499
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:56,216
That's right, Daddy.
I'm shaking you down.

500
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:59,844
You can keep those, by the way.
I have copies.

501
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,518
The governor's hosting a fundraiser
in Seaside.

502
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,813
But I'll be back for your next match.

503
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:14,150
Which is what I want
to talk to you about.

504
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:22,158
Ending a fight in a single punch
is not entertaining enough.

505
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:25,161
Tonight,
your opponent should be no trouble.

506
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:26,371
Punish him.

507
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,990
Give us a show. And savor it.

508
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:34,295
Make it last,
oh, five or six rounds, at least.

509
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,340
That should fully sate
the crowd's bloodlust.

510
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:38,889
And mine. Understood?

511
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:45,974
Yes, sir.

512
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:57,026
I thought being here...

513
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,446
I'd pay for everything that I did.

514
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,616
But what the warden wants me to do,
to become...

515
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,036
is so much worse.

516
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:12,125
When you were little,
I used to get calls from your school.

517
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:16,421
Telling me that you had been in a fight,
usually protecting someone.

518
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,048
The warden wants six rounds, Dad.

519
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,718
He wants blood.
There's nothing that I can do.

520
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:25,138
Your seventh-grade teacher told me
one thing's for sure.

521
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:28,391
"By the time Archie gets out
of junior high school,

522
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:31,978
he's gonna know how to throw a punch,
and how to take one."

523
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:36,232
There are other ways of putting
on a show for the warden.

524
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,485
Figure it out, son.

00:40:57,746 --> 00:41:01,167
Well, if what Ethel said about
that being the only rulebook is true,

700
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:04,253
no one's gonna play
that game ever again.

701
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:07,840
It's over.

702
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,223
I did what you asked.

703
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:17,892
I spread your gospel.

704
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:21,489
[Jughead] <i>Ethel must've done it</i>
<i>before our rendezvous in the bunker.</i>

705
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,772
<i>Or maybe there was someone else
helping her.</i>

706
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:31,238
- Um, excuse you?
- Where'd you get this?

707
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,824
It was in my locker.
Same with everyone else.

708
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,955
[Jughead] <i>Either way, by next weekend,</i>

709
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:43,709
<i>almost every student at Riverdale High
would play Gryphons and Gargoyles.</i>

710
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:48,047
<i>And the real game was just beginning.</i>

711
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:49,507
Soon they'll join us.

712
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:51,967
All of them, my King.
