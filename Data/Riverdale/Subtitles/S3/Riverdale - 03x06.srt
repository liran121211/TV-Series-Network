you think got into him?

180
00:08:09,047 --> 00:08:10,432
Well, according to
Archie, Joaquin did it

181
00:08:10,434 --> 00:08:11,500
for Warden Norton.

182
00:08:11,502 --> 00:08:12,734
And when the Warden confronted Betty,

183
00:08:12,736 --> 00:08:14,536
he called Archie the Red Paladin.

184
00:08:14,538 --> 00:08:15,871
Plus, the Warden poisoned himself

185
00:08:15,873 --> 00:08:18,006
with cyanide and blueberry Fresh-Aid.

186
00:08:18,008 --> 00:08:19,508
And he worked for Riverdale High

187
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,909
before the Detention Center.

188
00:08:20,911 --> 00:08:23,312
The question is, was he
playing G&G with someone,

189
00:08:23,314 --> 00:08:24,379
or for someone?

190
00:08:24,381 --> 00:08:25,614
And since he's dead,

191
00:08:25,616 --> 00:08:27,545
Joaquin's the only one
who can know the answer.

192
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,318
Right. Joaquin may not be alone.

193
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,186
Kevin said that he might
be rolling with a new gang.

194
00:08:31,188 --> 00:08:32,688
Those Gargoyle creeps you saw?

195
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,189
Exactly.

196
00:08:34,191 --> 00:08:37,359
And if the gang is working for the King,

197
00:08:37,361 --> 00:08:39,328
then they're gonna take us right to him.

198
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,764
Archie, you haven't eaten your burger.

199
00:08:43,734 --> 00:08:47,069

feeling so hot right now, Kev.

Okay.

203
00:08:59,717 --> 00:09:01,518
That is definitely infected.

224
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:10,920
we would never talk about this.

225
00:10:10,923 --> 00:10:12,156
I mean, who else did you tell?

226
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:14,072
I told Betty to protect her,

227
00:10:14,075 --> 00:10:15,374
so she wouldn't play the game.

228
00:10:15,377 --> 00:10:16,908
And it worked. I'm not playing the game,

229
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,641
but many of your kids are.

230
00:10:18,643 --> 00:10:20,922
This is about protecting
them, don't you care?

00:10:20,925 --> 00:10:23,445

00:10:23,447 --> 00:10:25,114
I should be with her right now.

Not here rehashing the past
when it has zero relevance.

234
00:10:28,319 --> 00:10:30,719
Attorney McCoy, it is relevant.

235
00:10:30,721 --> 00:10:32,655
Your daughter is playing the game,

236
00:10:32,657 --> 00:10:34,461
along with Kevin and Cheryl,

237
00:10:34,464 --> 00:10:36,364
and even your son Reggie, Mr. Mantle,

238

black eyes you give him.

239
00:10:39,329 --> 00:10:40,795
I would never hit my son.

240
00:10:40,797 --> 00:10:42,230
Another lie.

241

Guys, it was bound to get out sometime.

242
00:10:44,634 --> 00:10:46,634
Our children need to know the truth.

243
00:10:46,636 --> 00:10:47,869
So, Betty, where do we start?

244
00:10:47,871 --> 00:10:50,605
With the dead warden
from Archie's juvie.

245
00:10:50,607 --> 00:10:53,074
He was also the RROTC instructor

246
00:10:53,076 --> 00:10:54,742
when you guys were in high school.

247
00:10:54,744 --> 00:10:56,845
Mr. Keller, you were
a cadet at the time.

248
00:10:56,847 --> 00:10:58,228
Did you play the game with him?

249
00:10:58,231 --> 00:11:00,315
Major Norton just confiscated it.

250
00:11:00,317 --> 00:11:01,783
Straight manual, that's all.

251
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,254
Mr. Lodge, you had business
dealings with Warden Norton

252
00:11:06,256 --> 00:11:08,022
until he died.

253
00:11:08,024 --> 00:11:09,424
What were they?

254
00:11:09,426 --> 00:11:11,217
And did you know that
he was playing G&G?

255
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,827
None of your business,

256
00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:14,362
and not a clue.

257
00:11:14,364 --> 00:11:16,431
And what about Ascension
Night? Was he there?

258
00:11:16,433 --> 00:11:17,966
How are we supposed to answer that?

Wait, FP,

262
00:11:23,573 --> 00:11:24,806
you saw it too?

263
00:11:24,808 --> 00:11:27,508
Oh, this is such a waste of our time,

264
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,878
and I actually have a job
that I need to get back to,

265
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,479

266
00:11:31,481 --> 00:11:32,647
No, Hiram.

Otherwise, it will never end.

269
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:43,224
Betty, you wanna know
who poisoned the chalice.

270
00:11:44,694 --> 00:11:47,228
The Game Master is the
one who sets up the game.

271
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:51,332
So, my instinct is telling me that

272
00:11:51,334 --> 00:11:53,101
the culprit was Penelope Blossom.

273
00:11:53,103 --> 00:11:56,905
My guess is maybe she grew
the poison in her greenhouse.

274
00:11:56,907 --> 00:12:00,008
You don't grow cyanide, Hermione.

275
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,176
A fact that only a Blossom would know.

276
00:12:10,186 --> 00:12:11,703
It was Daryl Doiley.

277
00:12:13,757 --> 00:12:16,791
We were both Game Masters,

278
00:12:16,793 --> 00:12:18,893
and he was secretly in love with me.

279
00:12:20,996 --> 00:12:23,463
He put poison in the chalice,

280
00:12:23,466 --> 00:12:26,467
because he wanted us to ascend together.

281
00:12:28,238 --> 00:12:29,671
But I said no.

282
00:12:33,243 --> 00:12:35,610
I assumed

283
00:12:35,612 --> 00:12:37,812
the chalices were emptied afterwards,

284
00:12:37,814 --> 00:12:40,114
but they were not.

285
00:12:40,116 --> 00:12:42,283
Years later, Daryl came to me

286
00:12:42,285 --> 00:12:45,086
riddled with guilt over
that tragic incident,

287
00:12:45,088 --> 00:12:47,088
and seeking comfort.

288
00:12:47,724 --> 00:12:50,825
And I refused him again.

289
00:12:51,428 --> 00:12:54,963
We were both married
with families and...

290
00:12:56,633 --> 00:12:57,799

292
00:13:04,174 --> 00:13:05,673
So, he left.

294
00:13:10,113 --> 00:13:12,880

300
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,670

Because it was not the

Daryl Doiley's death was a

You didn't know, Mom?

Your husband left me in a jail cell

I found the deleted tape of
Sheriff Minetta coercing witnesses.

Attorney McCoy is meeting
with the judge as we speak

Believe me, I tried. Archie
said he couldn't come back.
