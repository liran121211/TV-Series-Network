1
00:00:00,801 --> 00:00:02,263
Previously on Riverdale...

2
00:00:02,266 --> 00:00:04,649
Welcome to the Pit. Give us a show.

3
00:00:04,651 --> 00:00:06,251
Hit me.

4
00:00:06,253 --> 00:00:07,886
Warden Norton is in your pocket.

5
00:00:07,888 --> 00:00:11,055
Everyone is in your pocket
except for me and Archie.

6
00:00:11,057 --> 00:00:13,558
Where's Mad Dog? Captain
Golightly said he died.

7
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,634
So what did you do to him?

8
00:00:14,637 --> 00:00:18,028
All three victims were playing
the game Gryphons and Gargoyles.

9
00:00:18,031 --> 00:00:20,298
So you're admitting the
game killed Dilton and Ben?

10
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,567
You've clearly played G&G before,

11
00:00:22,569 --> 00:00:25,537
and when you were my age, there
was another suspicious death

12
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:27,238
where the corpse had blue lips.

13
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,627
One of us was a murderer.

14
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:30,742
I saw a creature in the woods.

15
00:00:30,744 --> 00:00:33,338
What if it's the same person
from the Midnight Club?

16
00:00:33,341 --> 00:00:35,146
Swear to me that you won't play it.

17
00:00:35,148 --> 00:00:37,348
I wanna be worthy, Ethel.
Could you please show me how?

18
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,783
Welcome to your first game.

19
00:00:38,785 --> 00:00:39,945
This game, it's pure evil.

20
00:00:39,948 --> 00:00:41,414
That book may be our
best shot of figuring out

21
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,715
what happened to Dilton and Ben.

22
00:00:42,718 --> 00:00:45,155
We're gonna get the hell
out of here. We're escaping.

23
00:00:45,158 --> 00:00:46,191
Count me in.

24
00:00:51,631 --> 00:00:54,859
You are imprisoned in the
Gargoyle King's fortress.

25
00:00:54,862 --> 00:00:58,211
Trapped in pens, you live in fear,

26
00:00:58,213 --> 00:01:00,174
never knowing when
his legion of Gargoyles

27
00:01:00,177 --> 00:01:02,272
will descend from the sky to feed.

28
00:01:02,275 --> 00:01:04,175
But his guards are arrogant.

29
00:01:04,178 --> 00:01:07,586
You've been able to observe
and study their movements,

30
00:01:07,589 --> 00:01:09,447
and you've planned an escape.

31
00:01:09,449 --> 00:01:10,590
Pit's down.

32
00:01:10,593 --> 00:01:12,670
Baby Teeth got to the
breaker and cut the juice.

33
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:13,805
You're sure?

34
00:01:14,521 --> 00:01:15,920
You're absolutely positive?

35
00:01:16,556 --> 00:01:19,057
We can squeeze through those
wires at the top in that corner.

36
00:01:19,059 --> 00:01:20,825
But it won't be long before they notice

37
00:01:20,827 --> 00:01:22,427
and turn that fly fryer back on.

38
00:01:23,263 --> 00:01:24,496
It's now or never, Archie.

39
00:01:28,368 --> 00:01:31,334
Roll the dice to decide your fate.

40
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:33,671
Let's do it.

41
00:01:37,944 --> 00:01:39,077
Now.

42
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,118
Remember. It's only a game.

43
00:01:47,988 --> 00:01:49,502
It's not life or death...

44
00:01:50,524 --> 00:01:51,623
They wouldn't...

45
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:53,855
Unless, of course, it is.

46
00:02:14,447 --> 00:02:17,281
Your mission was
unsuccessful. Everyone dies.

47
00:02:17,284 --> 00:02:21,486
Jug, you won't believe the
story my mom told me last night.

48
00:02:23,757 --> 00:02:26,121
Jug, what are you doing?

49
00:02:27,127 --> 00:02:28,593
Betty.

50
00:02:28,595 --> 00:02:31,496
It's all making sense. All
of this is becoming clear.

51
00:02:31,498 --> 00:02:33,731
The game, the Gargoyle King.

52
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:36,634
I'm on Level Three, but it's only
a matter of time until I ascend.

53
00:02:37,337 --> 00:02:38,670
And I get to meet him.

54
00:02:40,307 --> 00:02:41,940
So you've confirmed...

55
00:02:41,942 --> 00:02:44,442
So my dad played G&G
in high school, huh?

56
00:02:44,444 --> 00:02:47,011
- Of course, it makes so much sense.
- All of our parents did.

57
00:02:47,013 --> 00:02:50,181
And they swore each other
to secrecy, but, Jug,

58
00:02:50,183 --> 00:02:54,018
while they were playing, one of them
killed their principal back then,

59
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:57,322
Felix Featherhead, either
accidentally or on purpose,

60
00:02:57,324 --> 00:02:59,756
but, he had blue lips.

61
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:04,395
Just like Ben and Dilton, which
is why all of this has to stop...

62
00:03:04,397 --> 00:03:06,698
Betty, the fact that
our parents played G&G

63
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,800
just corroborates what
I've come to believe,

64
00:03:09,536 --> 00:03:13,671
that we have been playing this
game for a lot longer than we know.

65
00:03:13,673 --> 00:03:16,841
And off-board. Think about
it, the Hot Dog rescue,

66
00:03:16,843 --> 00:03:18,576
what was that, if not a quest?

67
00:03:18,578 --> 00:03:21,112
The Serpents, the
Ghoulies, what are they?

68
00:03:21,114 --> 00:03:24,749
If not warring tribes, might as
well call us orcs and goblins.

69
00:03:24,751 --> 00:03:26,384
Okay, you're not making any sense

70
00:03:26,386 --> 00:03:28,720
and you're also not listening
to anything that I'm saying.

71
00:03:28,722 --> 00:03:33,958
We have nine suspects that
are all real, tangible leads.

72
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,395
One of our parents could be a
murderer, so let's go investigate them.

73
00:03:37,397 --> 00:03:39,224
You're not seeing the big picture.

74
00:03:39,227 --> 00:03:43,033
"Eldervair," the realm
of Gryphons and Gargoyles

75
00:03:43,036 --> 00:03:45,336
is an anagram for Riverdale.

76
00:03:45,338 --> 00:03:48,006
The whole game is an
analog for Riverdale.

77
00:03:48,008 --> 00:03:50,308
The game only exists in Riverdale.

78
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,243
That's why we couldn't
find it on the web.

79
00:03:52,245 --> 00:03:54,145
Okay, well, that is a weird coincidence.

80
00:03:54,147 --> 00:03:56,714
It's not a coincidence,
it's all connected.

81
00:03:56,716 --> 00:04:00,985
It's all one big narrative that's
still being written and played.

82
00:04:00,987 --> 00:04:03,961
Okay, you need to calm down,
Jug. Who's telling you this?

83
00:04:03,964 --> 00:04:05,790
The game. The more I play,

84
00:04:05,792 --> 00:04:08,200
the more familiar I become
with Eldervair and its rules,

85
00:04:08,201 --> 00:04:09,460
the more I see the patterns.

86
00:04:09,462 --> 00:04:12,230
The more I understand him or her,

87
00:04:12,232 --> 00:04:14,100
and how we'll catch the Gargoyle King.

88
00:04:14,103 --> 00:04:15,790
This game is their psychology.

89
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:18,102
It's their imagination.
It's how they view Riverdale.

90
00:04:18,104 --> 00:04:20,972
My mom was right, this
game messes with your head.

91
00:04:20,974 --> 00:04:23,941
No, no. This is the clarity
I needed, this is the truth.

92
00:04:23,943 --> 00:04:25,943
G&G's myths, they are our stories.

93
00:04:25,945 --> 00:04:28,880
They're our parents'
stories. Simple logic, Betty.

94
00:04:28,882 --> 00:04:30,658
How do you catch a Game Master?

95
00:04:31,885 --> 00:04:35,086
You become a Game Master
yourself. That's what I'm doing.

96
00:04:35,088 --> 00:04:38,558
And in the end, when I
prove that I'm at his level,

97
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,316
I'll come face to face with him.

98
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:47,265
Fine. As long as you're safe down here,

99
00:04:47,267 --> 00:04:51,536
that's one less thing for me to
worry about. So you keep playing.

100
00:04:51,538 --> 00:04:52,870
I'm going to go figure this out,

101
00:04:52,872 --> 00:04:54,639
starting with our nine suspects.

102
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:06,143
You really should go on a run
with me one of these morning, mija.

103
00:05:06,786 --> 00:05:08,753
Nothing's more invigorating.

104
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,958
By the way,

105
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,357
did you hear what happened
at Leopold and Loeb?

106
00:05:18,531 --> 00:05:21,766
Apparently, some
inmates tried to escape.

107
00:05:21,768 --> 00:05:26,344
And I hear their ring leader
was, once again, Archie Andrews.

108
00:05:28,007 --> 00:05:30,323
But no worries, the
guards caught them all

109
00:05:30,326 --> 00:05:32,343
after shooting them with rubber bullets.

110
00:05:32,345 --> 00:05:34,058
Of course, they'll be punished.

111
00:05:34,061 --> 00:05:36,848
They might add an extra
year to Archie's sentence.

112
00:05:39,252 --> 00:05:40,685
Huh.

113
00:05:42,123 --> 00:05:45,491
My friend, Warden Norton
runs an awfully tight ship.

114
00:05:46,463 --> 00:05:48,526
I know you're trying
to set me off right now,

115
00:05:48,528 --> 00:05:50,028
but it won't work.

116
00:05:50,996 --> 00:05:53,181
I'm getting Archie out,
one way or the other.

117
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,801
And then, you'll be the one rotting away

118
00:05:56,803 --> 00:05:59,308
in the very prison your
blood money has built.

119
00:06:08,414 --> 00:06:09,647
Yes.

120
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:11,716
Warden Norton, please.

121
00:06:14,988 --> 00:06:16,521
Are you comfortable?

122
00:06:16,523 --> 00:06:19,524
The idea to escape was all
mine. I told them to do it.

123
00:06:19,526 --> 00:06:20,925
Why am I not surprised?

124
00:06:25,999 --> 00:06:27,365
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

125
00:06:28,601 --> 00:06:29,867
What are you doing?

126
00:06:31,237 --> 00:06:32,870
Let this serve as a reminder,

127
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,942
you can't fight your destiny.

128
00:06:36,709 --> 00:06:38,509
No, please. No! Don't!

129
00:06:44,484 --> 00:06:47,318
Hold up. You're telling
me that my mother

130
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:52,857
was a rule-breaking, anti-apartheid
activist in high school?

131
00:06:52,859 --> 00:06:55,716
And that she and my dad
were together back then?

132
00:06:56,696 --> 00:06:57,728
I don't buy it.

133
00:06:58,531 --> 00:07:01,599
There's no way my old man
hung out and did, like, cosplay

134
00:07:01,601 --> 00:07:03,700
with a group of lame-ass nerds.

135
00:07:03,703 --> 00:07:05,336
Okay, it's true, Reggie.

136
00:07:05,338 --> 00:07:09,120
And you want us to
find out what exactly?

137
00:07:10,342 --> 00:07:13,927
My suspicion is that whoever
was running the game back then

138
00:07:13,928 --> 00:07:15,221
is running it now.

139
00:07:15,224 --> 00:07:18,282
Which is why we need to stop them
before things get any worse...

140
00:07:18,284 --> 00:07:19,650
What, what are you trying to say?

141
00:07:19,652 --> 00:07:22,620
That one of our parents
might be responsible

142
00:07:22,622 --> 00:07:25,223
- for what happened to Dilton and Ben?
- Maybe.

143
00:07:25,225 --> 00:07:27,191
And that's why you can't
tell them that you know

144
00:07:27,193 --> 00:07:29,994
about their Midnight Club,
okay? You have to be careful

145
00:07:29,996 --> 00:07:32,247
and subtle when you
ask them what they know.

146
00:07:35,267 --> 00:07:38,134
This speakeasy is impressive, Veronica.

147
00:07:38,137 --> 00:07:40,979
Impeccable taste and
a little elbow grease

148
00:07:40,982 --> 00:07:42,640
go a long way, Elio.

149
00:07:43,276 --> 00:07:46,311
But, from what I hear,
your Sweetwater Casino

150
00:07:46,314 --> 00:07:48,724
will soon be giving the
Miragio a run for its money.

151
00:07:49,581 --> 00:07:52,582
You know, if you added a
couple of slots, table games,

152
00:07:52,585 --> 00:07:54,819
maybe some cocktails with actual liquor

153
00:07:54,821 --> 00:07:57,788
you'd have quite the little gold
mine on your manicured hands.

154
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:01,659
Thank you for mansplaining
my business to me.

155
00:08:01,661 --> 00:08:04,028
- But that's not why I asked you here.
- Right.

156
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:06,080
You wanted to talk Leopold and Loeb?

157
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,841
More than talk.

158
00:08:07,844 --> 00:08:10,301
Archie's locked away in that hellhole,

159
00:08:10,303 --> 00:08:12,802
and I haven't heard from him in weeks.

160
00:08:12,805 --> 00:08:15,439
I've hit a dead end with
the Innocence Project.

161
00:08:15,441 --> 00:08:20,387
However, I've heard rumors that
L&L has direct ties to the mob.

162
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,690
That's why I thought you, with
your connections, could help.

163
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:29,186
Tell you what, Veronica, I'll
talk to some of my dad's friends,

164
00:08:29,188 --> 00:08:30,955
see what I can find out,

165
00:08:30,957 --> 00:08:35,493
- but, if I scratch your back...
- I'm a Lodge. I know how this goes.

166
00:08:35,495 --> 00:08:38,849
Just make it happen, and you'll
be appropriately recompensed.

167
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,910
Jones, we have a problem.

168
00:08:52,912 --> 00:08:55,152
Your boys went off the deep-end
and got into the arsenal.

169
00:09:00,653 --> 00:09:01,886
Oh, next time I'll get it.

170
00:09:01,888 --> 00:09:03,448
What's going on here, fellas?

171
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:07,758
Toni and I were in her
tent having a rendezvous...

172
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,394
When this arrow shot right through it.

173
00:09:10,396 --> 00:09:13,164
Three feet to the left and I'd
be missing an eye right now.

174
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:16,701
Yeah, well, we were practicing
our aim for the next quest.

175
00:09:16,704 --> 00:09:19,351
We wanna go off-board,
take G&G to the real world.

176
00:09:20,885 --> 00:09:23,285
- We heard other groups were doing it.
- Tough.

177
00:09:23,288 --> 00:09:25,576
I'm the Game Master so I
decide when we go off-board.

178
00:09:25,578 --> 00:09:27,645
You're the Serpent King, Jones.

179
00:09:27,647 --> 00:09:29,146
Isn't that enough?

180
00:09:29,148 --> 00:09:32,216
We're your foot-soldiers in life,
we gotta be the same in the game?

181
00:09:32,218 --> 00:09:34,352
Down in the mud, taking all the risks?

182
00:09:34,354 --> 00:09:37,221
Sweet Pea, we're not doing this again.

183
00:09:37,223 --> 00:09:40,191
Cheryl, grab your bow, notch an arrow.

184
00:09:42,095 --> 00:09:43,928
Jones, wait, what are you doing?

185
00:09:55,575 --> 00:09:57,675
Come on. Fire.

186
00:09:57,677 --> 00:09:59,243
He's not serious, is he?

187
00:09:59,245 --> 00:10:00,690
Fire, Deadeye!

188
00:10:01,247 --> 00:10:02,488
Whoa!

189
00:10:11,991 --> 00:10:14,690
Sweet Pea, if you have
something to prove,

190
00:10:14,693 --> 00:10:16,215
get against the tree.

191
00:10:16,218 --> 00:10:17,561
What?

192
00:10:19,766 --> 00:10:21,402
- Hell, no. You're crazy.
- No.

193
00:10:22,969 --> 00:10:27,905
I'm Game Master, which means
it's my game and my rules.

194
00:10:27,907 --> 00:10:30,877
You guys wanna go on a quest? You
want to prove you're bad-asses?

195
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,246
You're gonna get a chance.

196
00:10:32,249 --> 00:10:33,515
But not until I say so.

197
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,946
Don't defy me again.

198
00:10:39,235 --> 00:10:42,627

199
00:10:57,846 --> 00:11:00,620
Elio, what's the good word?

200
00:11:00,623 --> 00:11:03,181
I think I can get you
to your boy, Veronica.

201
00:11:03,184 --> 00:11:05,426
You'll come as my date,
but dress incognito.

202
00:11:06,186 --> 00:11:09,221
No problem. But, come
as your date to what?

203
00:11:09,224 --> 00:11:11,424
It's better if you just see it.

204
00:11:17,836 --> 00:11:20,465
So you're still screwing
around with this crap, huh, boy?

205
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,936
I guess the apple doesn't
fall too far from the tree.

206
00:11:23,938 --> 00:11:25,405
The hell is that supposed to mean?

207
00:11:25,408 --> 00:11:27,608
Means I know you played
G&G in high school, Dad.

208
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:31,010
And I know all about what
happened to your principal

209
00:11:31,012 --> 00:11:33,081
- during the Ascension Party.
- How?

210
00:11:34,793 --> 00:11:37,993
Betty. Which means
Alice spilled the beans.

211
00:11:37,996 --> 00:11:39,559
Big time.

212
00:11:39,562 --> 00:11:41,586
Yeah, well, whatever story
Betty's got in her head

213
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:44,490
about that night, you just remember
that's Alice's version, not mine.

214
00:11:44,492 --> 00:11:46,249
So, tell me yours.

215
00:11:50,432 --> 00:11:54,383
I've been through every
scenario about that night,

216
00:11:54,386 --> 00:11:57,303
other people could have been sneaking
into the school same way we were.

217
00:11:57,305 --> 00:11:59,280
Featherhead could have
had his own game going on.

218
00:11:59,283 --> 00:12:01,683
Yeah, there are infinite possibilities.

219
00:12:01,686 --> 00:12:03,321
But what's the most likely one?

220
00:12:03,324 --> 00:12:06,212
I don't know. I don't know
who killed Featherhead.

221
00:12:06,214 --> 00:12:09,443
I do. It was a Game Master.

222
00:12:09,446 --> 00:12:11,543
Whoever planned Ascension Night.

223
00:12:11,546 --> 00:12:14,753
Betty thinks it was someone from the
Midnight Club. But I'm not so sure.

224
00:12:14,756 --> 00:12:18,058
I think it was someone
who's playing a much longer,

225
00:12:18,061 --> 00:12:20,459
a much deeper game.

226
00:12:20,462 --> 00:12:23,296
And whoever it was, I'm
going to get inside their mind

227
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:26,586
and then I'm going to catch them.

228
00:12:27,474 --> 00:12:28,868
Don't you want that, Dad?

229
00:12:34,832 --> 00:12:37,643
No, it's not that at all.

230
00:12:37,645 --> 00:12:39,946
Well, this is nice. We
never get to do this.

231
00:12:39,948 --> 00:12:42,171
Yeah, this is a blast.

232
00:12:42,174 --> 00:12:45,897
So, uh, Mom, Mr. Keller,

233
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,987
Kevin and I were talking and we realized

234
00:12:48,997 --> 00:12:54,090
that we don't really know
anything about how you two met.

235
00:12:54,093 --> 00:12:57,763
Well, we were at Riverdale
High at the same time.

236
00:12:57,766 --> 00:12:59,799
- So you were friends back then?
- More acquaintances.

237
00:12:59,801 --> 00:13:01,601
We didn't run in the same circles.

238
00:13:01,603 --> 00:13:05,562
Oh, so you didn't do any
extracurriculars together?

239
00:13:05,565 --> 00:13:07,306
Not that I can recall.

240
00:13:07,308 --> 00:13:11,900
Um, I was in Model UN
and Volunteers of America.

241
00:13:11,903 --> 00:13:16,783
And I was in RROTC and
I was on the boxing team.

242
00:13:16,785 --> 00:13:20,577
Did you guys ever play
Gryphons and Gargoyles?

243
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,205
Yeah.

244
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:25,658
I mean, I knew some kids that played
it, but I wasn't really into that stuff.

245
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,878
Yeah, it never really
appealed to me either.

246
00:13:29,063 --> 00:13:32,992
Although, now that we're all together,

247
00:13:32,995 --> 00:13:35,251
Josie, Kevin,

248
00:13:37,138 --> 00:13:39,590
there's something we should discuss.

249
00:13:43,978 --> 00:13:46,012
Elio, what is this place?

250
00:13:46,014 --> 00:13:47,547
And why aren't we at the juvie?

251
00:13:47,549 --> 00:13:49,515
It's a decommissioned Rec Center.

252
00:13:49,517 --> 00:13:52,885
I didn't tell you beforehand because I
didn't want you calling in the cavalry.

253
00:13:52,887 --> 00:13:54,596
At least not while I'm here.

254
00:14:03,898 --> 00:14:05,665
My patience is wearing thin.

255
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:08,437
Easy, tigress, it's
just about show-time.

256
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,673
I'd recognize those abs anywhere.

257
00:14:15,043 --> 00:14:17,072
- Archie?
- Relax.

258
00:14:17,075 --> 00:14:18,860
I hear he always wins.

259
00:14:37,114 --> 00:14:38,497
Archie?

260
00:14:40,068 --> 00:14:41,334
Veronica.

261
00:14:50,445 --> 00:14:53,684
Wait. I don't understand.
How are you here?

262
00:14:53,687 --> 00:14:55,756
I know people who know people.

263
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:57,862
We only have about 20 minutes.

264
00:15:00,722 --> 00:15:01,954
Oh, my God.

265
00:15:02,757 --> 00:15:04,891
- What have they done to you?
- Ronnie.

266
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,493
I don't want to talk right now.

267
00:15:33,288 --> 00:15:36,289
I have been pursuing legal options,

268
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,311
but it's dead-end after dead-end.

269
00:15:38,314 --> 00:15:41,106
Which is why I'm thinking

270
00:15:42,764 --> 00:15:45,398
an old-fashioned prison break
might be your best option.

271
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,968
Ronnie, nobody has ever broken
out of Leopold and Loeb before.

272
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:51,736
Fine. But we're not in
Leopold and Loeb right now.

273
00:15:51,739 --> 00:15:55,439
The security Elio and I went
through to get in here was tight.

274
00:15:55,442 --> 00:15:58,077
- So we'll need another entry point.
- You're serious about this?

275
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,579
Deadly. Why?

276
00:16:00,581 --> 00:16:02,280
You have something in mind?

277
00:16:02,283 --> 00:16:04,273
Look, it's a long shot.

278
00:16:04,276 --> 00:16:07,486
But a couple weeks back, Warden
Norton had me hose down the pool

279
00:16:07,489 --> 00:16:09,122
to get rid of the blood.

280
00:16:10,825 --> 00:16:13,125
There's a drain, under the ring.

281
00:16:13,127 --> 00:16:15,963
I have no idea where it leads or
if I can even squeeze through it.

282
00:16:15,966 --> 00:16:17,686
Curse your broad shoulders.

283
00:16:19,434 --> 00:16:21,371
But if there's even a chance...

284
00:16:21,374 --> 00:16:23,436
Ronnie, I'm not sure
what I can do to help.

285
00:16:23,438 --> 00:16:25,056
Nothing.

286
00:16:25,059 --> 00:16:27,974
Let me do some research on the
place and see where the drain leads.

287
00:16:27,976 --> 00:16:30,977
You just be ready when the time comes.

288
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,781
- When's your next fight?
- It's coming up. Fast.

289
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:36,794
Then that's when we're breaking you out.

290
00:16:42,256 --> 00:16:43,456
Fellow Serpents,

291
00:16:44,451 --> 00:16:47,852
I know all of you have been
eager to get back to Eldervair.

292
00:16:50,298 --> 00:16:51,897
Well, cancel your plans.

293
00:16:53,701 --> 00:16:55,065
We play tomorrow.

294
00:17:00,174 --> 00:17:03,509
So they said nothing? Admitted nothing?

295
00:17:03,511 --> 00:17:06,212
All they did was lie and act
like they didn't know about G&G.

296
00:17:06,214 --> 00:17:07,650
Bury the lead, Kevin.

297
00:17:08,383 --> 00:17:10,580
They also announced
they're getting married.

298
00:17:12,186 --> 00:17:15,521
Oh, seriously? As what, a smokescreen?

299
00:17:15,523 --> 00:17:16,822
I have no clue.

300
00:17:16,824 --> 00:17:18,860
You think that was a crazy reaction?

301
00:17:20,428 --> 00:17:23,460
This is what I got when I asked
my dad about that stupid game.

302
00:17:24,866 --> 00:17:26,497
Why are our parents being so cagey

303
00:17:26,498 --> 00:17:29,094
about something that
happened 25 years ago?

304
00:17:30,872 --> 00:17:32,390
What aren't you telling us?

305
00:17:34,374 --> 00:17:37,008
Guys, whatever this is, it has to wait.

306
00:17:37,011 --> 00:17:38,230
What's wrong, Vee?

307
00:17:38,233 --> 00:17:39,812
I saw Archie.

308
00:17:39,814 --> 00:17:43,082
He's caught up in some
diabolical teen fight-club.

309
00:17:43,085 --> 00:17:47,220
And I need to break him out of juvie
before he dies or kills somebody.

310
00:17:48,289 --> 00:17:50,306
And you all have to help me.

311
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:00,854
Jug?

312
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,215
Betty.

313
00:18:03,967 --> 00:18:06,301
What are you doing?
Getting ready for a party?

314
00:18:06,303 --> 00:18:08,837
Yeah, we're about to start a
new quest. Do you want to join?

315
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:12,107
Even if I wanted to, I can't.

316
00:18:12,109 --> 00:18:15,510
It's a long story but I'm helping
Veronica break Archie out of juvie

317
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:18,680
- and I'm hoping you can come with us.
- Wait. What?

318
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:20,381
You're breaking Archie out of juvie?

319
00:18:20,384 --> 00:18:22,625
- I know it sounds insane.
- No.

320
00:18:22,628 --> 00:18:24,519
Sounds perfect.

321
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:26,320
What? What do you mean?

322
00:18:26,323 --> 00:18:30,191
Betty, this quest that I've been
working on, that we're about to start,

323
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:33,628
I thought I was finished, but it
lacked heart, it lacked humanity,

324
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:38,467
until you just gave
me the missing piece.

325
00:18:39,328 --> 00:18:40,935
We'll make it a rescue mission,

326
00:18:42,005 --> 00:18:43,705
to save their friend.

327
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:46,307
All Ethel ever talked
about was being worthy.

328
00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:49,778
- What is more worthy than that?
- Jughead, this is not a game!

329
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:53,782
This is Archie's life and since
you refuse to recognize that,

330
00:18:55,152 --> 00:18:56,869
I'm taking your bike.

331
00:19:04,335 --> 00:19:07,094
This is quite the spread, Warden.

332
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:16,204
All this, after I tried to escape.

333
00:19:16,206 --> 00:19:18,453
That makes me think
you're not rewarding me.

334
00:19:18,456 --> 00:19:19,974
Hmm.

335
00:19:19,976 --> 00:19:21,075
You're getting rid of me.

336
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:24,012
I'm afraid so.

337
00:19:24,822 --> 00:19:27,607
Your final meal before your final fight.

338
00:19:29,052 --> 00:19:30,919
You have powerful enemies, Archie.

339
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,756
I appreciate you being
honest with me, Warden.

340
00:19:35,587 --> 00:19:38,393
But since this may be the
last meal that I ever eat,

341
00:19:39,963 --> 00:19:41,862
can I ask you a question?

342
00:19:41,865 --> 00:19:43,498
Go on.

343
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,035
How exactly did Hiram Lodge pin
Cassidy Bullock's murder on me?

344
00:19:47,037 --> 00:19:48,203
Do you know?

345
00:19:52,509 --> 00:19:53,843
It's as you imagine.

346
00:19:54,628 --> 00:19:57,758
We paid Mr. Bullock's friends, the
ones that were with him that night,

347
00:19:58,415 --> 00:20:00,871
$10,000 each to lie under oath.

348
00:20:01,585 --> 00:20:04,051
And say that they saw
you pull the trigger.

349
00:20:04,054 --> 00:20:06,041
That's how much your
life is worth, Andrews.

350
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,247
$30,000.

351
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,951
- Where are they now? Dead?
- They might as well be.

352
00:20:10,954 --> 00:20:12,660
It's my understanding
that they're in hiding.

353
00:20:12,662 --> 00:20:14,863
Some say, in Shadow Woods. But me,

354
00:20:15,832 --> 00:20:18,288
I'd hide in the mines by Shadow Lake.

355
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,101
No chance of being found there.

356
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:25,225
One last question.

357
00:20:26,243 --> 00:20:28,810
Does Hiram Lodge own you, too, Warden?

358
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:30,311
Has he always pulled the strings?

359
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:32,881
My soul belongs to no
mere mortal, Andrews.

360
00:20:35,518 --> 00:20:36,985
Judgement of all men

361
00:20:38,054 --> 00:20:40,620
belongs to he who resides
in the kingdom alone.

362
00:20:43,226 --> 00:20:46,194
But he's watching us,
he's always watching.

363
00:20:52,602 --> 00:20:54,486
Thank you all for coming.

364
00:20:54,489 --> 00:20:57,638
I've gathered you all here
because the world is changing.

365
00:20:57,641 --> 00:21:01,287
Strange, dark times have fallen upon us.

366
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:05,329
As you all know, Archie's
stuck behind bars.

367
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:08,216
His life is in danger.

368
00:21:08,218 --> 00:21:10,383
The realm of Eldervair is in disorder,

369
00:21:11,421 --> 00:21:12,720
afflicted by evil,

370
00:21:13,656 --> 00:21:16,757
as its heart and soul, the Red Paladin

371
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,027
has been captured by the Mad Emperor

372
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:20,628
and twisted into a beast of war.

373
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:24,198
Before we get started, I
want to acknowledge that, yes,

374
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,868
we are flying by the
seat of our pants here,

375
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,938
but as much as possible,
we must follow the plan.

376
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,806
The slightest deviation, and
Archie could wind up dead.

377
00:21:36,112 --> 00:21:38,047
We'll need a distraction

378
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:41,149
to disorient the guards and
hide Archie's play for the grate,

379
00:21:41,151 --> 00:21:44,419
something we can sneak
into the location easily,

380
00:21:44,421 --> 00:21:47,789
that won't arouse suspicion,
something we make ourselves.

381
00:21:48,699 --> 00:21:49,927
As for the getaway route,

382
00:21:49,928 --> 00:21:53,127
I want you positioned
for the pickup here, Bee.

383
00:21:53,129 --> 00:21:55,017
If you stick to the woods,

384
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,108
their cars shouldn't
be able to follow you.

385
00:21:57,111 --> 00:21:58,477
Just in case,

386
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:02,812
might I suggest we put
another precaution in place.

387
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,775
Joaquin,

388
00:22:08,864 --> 00:22:10,486
something might go down.

389
00:22:11,912 --> 00:22:14,705
If it does, just know that I
will come back for you guys.

390
00:22:18,088 --> 00:22:19,554
Hey, Joaquin,

391
00:22:21,124 --> 00:22:22,515
you with me?

392
00:22:27,963 --> 00:22:29,296
Dude, what are you doing?

393
00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:31,065
Our game begins with a Judas kiss.

394
00:22:31,067 --> 00:22:34,519
I'm sorry, Archie. But the
Warden said that if I did this,

395
00:22:34,522 --> 00:22:35,862
I'd finally ascend.

396
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,711
A dastardly act of betrayal.

397
00:22:43,713 --> 00:22:45,546
A traitor has wounded the Paladin,

398
00:22:45,548 --> 00:22:47,682
severely weakening his defenses.

399
00:22:47,684 --> 00:22:51,117
With his life in peril, it's
now up to you, Dream Warriors,

400
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,174
to save the Red Paladin

401
00:22:53,177 --> 00:22:57,425
and to restore peace
and order to the realm.

402
00:22:57,427 --> 00:22:58,593
But be warned,

403
00:22:59,896 --> 00:23:03,164
with every second that passes,
the Paladin's fate dims,

404
00:23:04,401 --> 00:23:07,012
and with it, all hope

405
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:09,370
for peace in the realm.

406
00:23:16,913 --> 00:23:18,246
Without further ado...

407
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:23,751
Let the game begin.

408
00:23:58,977 --> 00:24:00,691
- Password?
- Contra.

409
00:24:00,693 --> 00:24:02,059
Nice try.

410
00:24:03,896 --> 00:24:05,252
That's what it was last time.

411
00:24:05,255 --> 00:24:06,517
It changes every time.

412
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,986
- Hmm.
- What are your names?

413
00:24:08,701 --> 00:24:11,602
Deadeye, you're at the entrance
of the Mad Emperor's dungeon,

414
00:24:11,604 --> 00:24:14,939
but you've been blocked by a
bridge troll. How do you proceed?

415
00:24:14,941 --> 00:24:17,308
I roll for an intimidation
spell, obviously.

416
00:24:19,912 --> 00:24:21,111
What's my name?

417
00:24:21,763 --> 00:24:22,947
What's your name?

418
00:24:23,992 --> 00:24:25,525
I'm Monica Norton.

419
00:24:25,528 --> 00:24:27,934
Perhaps you're familiar
with Warden Norton?

420
00:24:28,854 --> 00:24:30,487
Of course.

421
00:24:30,489 --> 00:24:33,023
Good. We understand each other then.

422
00:24:34,108 --> 00:24:36,198
My fiance and I are here for the show.

423
00:24:37,129 --> 00:24:38,562
We want to see blood.

424
00:24:38,564 --> 00:24:42,491
The fighters' blood,
yours, I don't really care.

425
00:24:42,494 --> 00:24:43,927
As long as it's red.

426
00:24:45,148 --> 00:24:47,692
So if you need to call Warden
Norton to get me cleared...

427
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:49,446
Ah, that won't be necessary, miss.

428
00:24:50,242 --> 00:24:51,408
Sorry for the delay.

429
00:24:53,044 --> 00:24:55,044
Good job. You're inside.

430
00:24:55,047 --> 00:24:56,246
Pantera, you're up.

431
00:24:59,151 --> 00:25:00,684
Whoa, where are you going with that?

432
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:04,021
I'm supposed to put this
with the other refreshments.

433
00:25:04,858 --> 00:25:06,917
If you don't mind, I
can just run this inside.

434
00:25:17,937 --> 00:25:19,503
I think it's starting.

435
00:25:23,609 --> 00:25:25,896
We're entering the Lion's Den.

436
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,233
The Paladin is being marched in

437
00:25:29,215 --> 00:25:30,948
to meet his doom.

438
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:35,552
For he must face a
resurrected Hellhound.

439
00:25:47,667 --> 00:25:49,199
Mad Dog!

440
00:25:49,201 --> 00:25:51,130
I thought you were dead.
Where have you been?

441
00:25:52,223 --> 00:25:53,737
It's me, Archie.

442
00:26:21,954 --> 00:26:23,233
Care for a drink?

443
00:26:25,404 --> 00:26:28,766
I just overheard some guards
betting heavily against Archie.

444
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,172
They say he's going down.

445
00:26:31,702 --> 00:26:34,479
That other guy's huge. I'm
not sure Archie's got long.

446
00:26:36,682 --> 00:26:37,950
Okay.

447
00:26:39,185 --> 00:26:41,251
Get in position. Wait for my signal.

448
00:26:50,221 --> 00:26:52,563
You've arrived at the
Mad Emperor's tunnel.

449
00:26:52,565 --> 00:26:53,881
You found the entrance.

450
00:26:53,884 --> 00:26:57,900
But, the Mad Emperor has placed a
Bano protection spell over the barrier.

451
00:26:57,903 --> 00:26:59,403
Now that is super annoying.

452
00:27:04,404 --> 00:27:05,682
Joaquin?

453
00:27:06,712 --> 00:27:08,579
Kevin, what are you doing here?

454
00:27:08,581 --> 00:27:11,073
We're breaking Archie out.
What are you doing here?

455
00:27:12,518 --> 00:27:15,519
It doesn't matter. And
it's too late for Archie.

456
00:27:16,455 --> 00:27:18,922
Where are you going?
Back to the Serpents?

457
00:27:18,924 --> 00:27:21,358
No. No, no, no. I
joined a different gang.

458
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,427
- Who?
- You don't want to know, Kevin.

459
00:27:23,429 --> 00:27:26,463
Just leave. You got to
get out of here. Right now.

460
00:27:26,465 --> 00:27:28,232
- Wait...
- Go. Go!

461
00:27:28,234 --> 00:27:29,266
Wait, Joaquin!

462
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,845
Come on. Hit me.

463
00:27:35,848 --> 00:27:37,275
Right here. Do it.

464
00:27:43,082 --> 00:27:45,716
I'm not fighting you, Mad
Dog. You're not my enemy.

465
00:27:45,718 --> 00:27:48,285
But you got to listen to
me, there's a plan in place.

466
00:27:48,287 --> 00:27:50,354
My girl is going to cause a commotion,

467
00:27:50,356 --> 00:27:53,123
and I'm going to make a break
for the drain underneath the ring.

468
00:27:53,125 --> 00:27:54,324
Come with me.

469
00:28:00,073 --> 00:28:01,387
You'll never make it.

470
00:28:02,635 --> 00:28:04,135
Not after getting shivved.

471
00:28:04,138 --> 00:28:06,058
Yes, I can.

472
00:28:07,253 --> 00:28:08,806
You're gonna need a head-start.

473
00:28:11,989 --> 00:28:14,610
Deadeye Blossom, you're up.

474
00:28:14,613 --> 00:28:17,948
- Betty, thank God.
- Kev, why isn't the grate opened?

475
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,835
There's a lock we didn't know about.

476
00:28:19,838 --> 00:28:22,443
But look, Joaquin was just here,

477
00:28:22,446 --> 00:28:24,179
and I have to go after him.

478
00:28:24,182 --> 00:28:27,890
Well, I got this, but you can't go
after Joaquin. What about Archie?

479
00:28:27,893 --> 00:28:29,535
I'll be back. I promise.

480
00:28:30,591 --> 00:28:32,495
What is it, Game Master?

481
00:28:32,498 --> 00:28:33,797
It's a curveball.

482
00:28:36,569 --> 00:28:40,204
You're about to come
face-to-face with the Dark Dragon.

483
00:28:40,206 --> 00:28:43,373
It's the most evil-tempered,
vile creature in the land.

484
00:28:43,375 --> 00:28:47,857
With forked tongue and snarling black
slime, it reeks of rotting flesh.

485
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,199
Veronica, what do you
think you're doing here?

486
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,382
I can ask you the same, Daddy.

487
00:28:53,385 --> 00:28:55,152
And I bet my answer's better than yours.

488
00:28:55,154 --> 00:28:58,343
Whatever scheme you've
cooked up, it ends right now.

489
00:28:59,274 --> 00:29:01,091
Sorry, Daddykins,

490
00:29:01,094 --> 00:29:03,894
but this is going to hurt you
a lot more than it will me.

491
00:29:05,192 --> 00:29:06,396
Ow!

492
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:07,631
Well played.

493
00:29:07,633 --> 00:29:10,085
You've impaled the dragon
with your concealed dagger.

494
00:29:29,054 --> 00:29:30,440
Mad Dog, let's go. Come on.

495
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:33,005
I won't get through that grate.

496
00:29:33,592 --> 00:29:36,592
I tried. But you go.
I'll hold off the guards.

497
00:29:36,595 --> 00:29:39,051
- Yeah, but you...
- Just go, Red! Don't look back.

498
00:29:47,339 --> 00:29:50,607
- Warden, he's getting away.
- Guards! Stop him!

499
00:30:18,572 --> 00:30:20,077
Find him.

500
00:30:22,938 --> 00:30:24,738
We know where that pipe leads.

501
00:30:28,032 --> 00:30:31,601
Find him right now!

502
00:30:36,257 --> 00:30:37,589
Archie.

503
00:30:49,603 --> 00:30:51,370
- Betty.
- Hi.

504
00:30:51,372 --> 00:30:52,624
What took you so long?

505
00:30:52,627 --> 00:30:54,439
I could ask you the same thing.

506
00:30:54,441 --> 00:30:56,074
Are those clothes for me?

507
00:30:56,076 --> 00:30:57,276
Oh, my God.

508
00:30:58,045 --> 00:30:59,177
You're bleeding.

509
00:31:00,648 --> 00:31:03,181
I got to put pressure
on it. Here, come here.

510
00:31:05,699 --> 00:31:07,692
You freed the Paladin from the dungeon.

511
00:31:07,695 --> 00:31:09,887
But you're not clear of
the Mad Emperor just yet.

512
00:31:19,933 --> 00:31:22,668
What the hell are you
waiting for? Go after them!

513
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:25,671
In fact, the Emperor sends a
ruthless cavalry in pursuit.

514
00:31:25,673 --> 00:31:28,940
Your noble steed is no match for
the cavalry's mighty stallions.

515
00:31:29,586 --> 00:31:31,472
Do you continue on your path

516
00:31:32,179 --> 00:31:34,212
or do you surrender and beg for mercy?

517
00:31:34,214 --> 00:31:35,414
- Keep going!
- Never give up!

518
00:31:35,416 --> 00:31:37,416
- Go! Go!
- Keep going!

519
00:31:37,418 --> 00:31:39,384
You lean forward in your saddle

520
00:31:39,386 --> 00:31:41,253
urging your horse to fly.

521
00:31:41,255 --> 00:31:44,421
On all sides, the forest
becomes a blur of green,

522
00:31:44,424 --> 00:31:46,458
but, a quick peek back

523
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:50,329
reveals the Emperor's nightmares
galloping at supernatural speed.

524
00:31:50,331 --> 00:31:53,665
It's like hell itself is chasing
you and it's gaining ground.

525
00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:55,456
One loose rock,

526
00:31:55,459 --> 00:31:59,537
one cursed root will send you
toppling at this lethal speed.

527
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:02,297
But you force those
thoughts out of your mind.

528
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:07,244
You feel the battle-fury of
your forefathers rise within you,

529
00:32:07,247 --> 00:32:10,449
an inextinguishable fire
pulsing through your veins.

530
00:32:10,451 --> 00:32:13,452
You are the light
out-running the darkness.

531
00:32:13,454 --> 00:32:15,721
Go around. It's on the other side.

532
00:32:15,723 --> 00:32:19,358
You will escape, you will be victorious.

533
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,794
But then, you're barreling
towards the edge of a cliff,

534
00:32:22,796 --> 00:32:24,272
you must stop.

535
00:32:32,482 --> 00:32:34,038
What can we do for you, fellas?

536
00:32:34,041 --> 00:32:35,674
Bravo!

537
00:32:35,676 --> 00:32:37,175
Your deception gambit has paid off.

538
00:32:37,978 --> 00:32:39,644
You've outsmarted the Emperor's cavalry.

539
00:32:39,646 --> 00:32:40,746
Yeah!

540
00:33:08,275 --> 00:33:09,341
Game Master.

541
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:12,344
Um, hello? What happened?

542
00:33:12,346 --> 00:33:13,862
Did we save the Red Paladin?

543
00:33:15,115 --> 00:33:17,783
I don't know. I made a
last-minute change to the quest.

544
00:33:17,785 --> 00:33:21,219
I was hoping to have the ending or
the answer by the time I got this far.

545
00:33:21,221 --> 00:33:22,754
What do you mean you don't know?

546
00:33:22,756 --> 00:33:24,723
Game Master, where is the Red Paladin?

547
00:33:24,725 --> 00:33:25,891
Where is he?

548
00:33:26,657 --> 00:33:28,649
Where is the Red Paladin?

549
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:32,531
I... I don't know what
you're talking about.

550
00:33:32,533 --> 00:33:34,455
Let him go, Warden Norton.

551
00:33:35,803 --> 00:33:37,669
Let him go or I'll mace you.

552
00:33:43,007 --> 00:33:44,309
Fall back.

553
00:33:44,887 --> 00:33:46,556
Everyone, back to the center.

554
00:33:55,985 --> 00:33:57,600
Is it over? Did he die?

555
00:34:32,552 --> 00:34:35,440
There, you are all patched up.

556
00:34:35,443 --> 00:34:37,935
Now don't make any sudden movements.

557
00:34:37,937 --> 00:34:39,270
I won't. Thanks, Toni.

558
00:34:46,846 --> 00:34:48,717
Who did that to you, Archie?

559
00:34:49,249 --> 00:34:51,906
It was Joaquin. He stabbed me.

560
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:53,418
I think the Warden made him do it.

561
00:34:59,392 --> 00:35:00,907
Guys, where the hell am I?

562
00:35:01,861 --> 00:35:03,487
You're in Dilton Doiley's bunker.

563
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:06,063
The only people who know
it exists are in this room.

564
00:35:06,066 --> 00:35:09,133
Right now, it's the safest place
for you in Riverdale. I promise.

565
00:35:09,135 --> 00:35:10,635
Dilton Doiley has a bunker?

566
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:14,919
We'll catch you up to speed
once you're rested, okay?

567
00:35:18,266 --> 00:35:19,677
Archie.

568
00:35:22,315 --> 00:35:23,714
What is that on your hip?

569
00:35:25,536 --> 00:35:27,085
Courtesy of Warden Norton,

570
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:32,008
to put me in my place after I
tried to escape the first time.

571
00:35:32,011 --> 00:35:34,678
The Warden branded you and
ordered Joaquin to stab you?

572
00:35:36,365 --> 00:35:37,762
Jug...

573
00:35:43,036 --> 00:35:44,602
Can I have everyone's attention?

574
00:35:48,717 --> 00:35:51,018
Since my father saw me,

575
00:35:51,021 --> 00:35:53,621
I need to go do some damage
control on the home front.

576
00:35:53,624 --> 00:35:57,482
But, someone needs to stay
with Archie at all times.

577
00:35:57,484 --> 00:36:00,952
- Ronnie, I don't need anyone...
- Yes, you do.

578
00:36:00,954 --> 00:36:03,621
You go ahead, Vee. Jughead and
I will take the first shift.

579
00:36:03,623 --> 00:36:04,655
Excellent.

580
00:36:05,658 --> 00:36:08,301
Now, equally important,

581
00:36:08,312 --> 00:36:12,371
everyone in this room is part of a pact.

582
00:36:12,374 --> 00:36:16,367
From this moment on, no one
knows where this bunker is.

583
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:20,171
No one was involved with that breakout,

584
00:36:21,215 --> 00:36:24,826
and no one is aware of
Archie's whereabouts.

585
00:36:26,819 --> 00:36:28,019
To the grave.

586
00:36:29,549 --> 00:36:30,832
Capisce?

587
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:40,556
Are you out of your mind, Hiram?

588
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:43,594
Archie escaped from an
underground fight-club?

589
00:36:43,597 --> 00:36:45,028
That you knew about?

590
00:36:45,031 --> 00:36:47,198
I am being hounded by social workers.

591
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,634
The Innocence Project is
breathing down my neck!

592
00:36:49,636 --> 00:36:52,737
I mean, for God's sake, I took
donations from Warden Norton.

593
00:36:52,739 --> 00:36:55,673
Stop yelling. We can get
ahead of this. Contain it.

594
00:36:56,576 --> 00:37:00,244
Oh, and finally, she arrives.

595
00:37:00,246 --> 00:37:03,147
Do you have any idea the
kind of mess you've made?

596
00:37:03,149 --> 00:37:05,381
Me? What about your husband?

597
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:09,653
Madre de Dios! You two are unbelievable.

598
00:37:09,656 --> 00:37:12,086
This obsession that you both

599
00:37:12,089 --> 00:37:15,356
have with Archie Andrews
is going to destroy us.

600
00:37:19,531 --> 00:37:21,375
Where the hell are you going?

601
00:37:21,378 --> 00:37:23,961
To try and contain the mess
that you and your daughter made.

602
00:37:31,244 --> 00:37:33,282
I tried to find him, but it was no use.

603
00:37:33,285 --> 00:37:35,823
- I had to double-back
and be the decoy. - Oh...

604
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:41,194
- Thanks, Pop.
- Welcome.

605
00:37:42,856 --> 00:37:44,088
He's out there.

606
00:37:44,753 --> 00:37:46,556
Joaquin is out there.

607
00:37:49,103 --> 00:37:51,213
I still can't believe
we pulled off the escape.

608
00:37:51,224 --> 00:37:52,508
Shh!

609
00:37:52,511 --> 00:37:54,898
Sorry. My bad.

610
00:37:54,901 --> 00:37:57,068
- It's a secret.
- Yeah.

611
00:37:58,771 --> 00:38:02,707
Speaking of, are we
going to do this or not?

612
00:38:07,814 --> 00:38:10,100
- I don't know, you guys.
- Come on, Josie.

613
00:38:10,103 --> 00:38:14,386
Don't you want to find out what
our parents and Betty won't tell us?

614
00:38:19,726 --> 00:38:22,976
I want to know the
truth. Wherever it leads.

615
00:38:26,683 --> 00:38:29,339
We interrupt our Top Ten countdown

616
00:38:29,342 --> 00:38:31,302
with an important news bulletin.

617
00:38:31,304 --> 00:38:33,804
Convicted murderer,
Archibald Andrews has escaped

618
00:38:33,806 --> 00:38:36,440
from the Leopold and Loeb
Juvenile Detention Center.

619
00:38:36,442 --> 00:38:38,442
He is considered extremely dangerous.

620
00:38:38,444 --> 00:38:40,311
The public is advised to remain indoors

621
00:38:40,313 --> 00:38:42,480
and to report suspicious activity.

622
00:38:42,483 --> 00:38:46,261
It is believed he will seek refuge
in his hometown of Riverdale.

623
00:38:48,655 --> 00:38:50,555
He's finally asleep.

624
00:38:50,557 --> 00:38:53,084
Jug, his burn mark...

625
00:38:53,087 --> 00:38:54,334
You mean his brand?

626
00:38:55,061 --> 00:38:58,329
Looks a lot like a runic symbol
from Gryphons and Gargoyles.

627
00:38:59,407 --> 00:39:00,698
He said the Warden gave it to him.

628
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:04,101
The Warden also called
Archie a Red Paladin.

629
00:39:04,103 --> 00:39:07,524
Does that mean the
Warden is playing G&G?

630
00:39:07,527 --> 00:39:09,207
See, this is what I'm saying, Betty.

631
00:39:09,209 --> 00:39:12,543
This game is so much bigger
than a couple of kids playing.

632
00:39:12,545 --> 00:39:15,668
What if Warden Norton
is the Gargoyle King?

633
00:39:15,671 --> 00:39:17,215
Jug,

634
00:39:18,551 --> 00:39:20,766
before we dive back in,

635
00:39:20,769 --> 00:39:24,048
I think you should go
home and get some rest.

636
00:39:24,051 --> 00:39:26,324
How long has it been since you've slept?

637
00:39:28,194 --> 00:39:30,586
Just get a couple of hours at least.

638
00:39:31,605 --> 00:39:33,130
I'll take this watch.

639
00:39:41,808 --> 00:39:43,174
Sleep well, Paladin.

640
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:47,693
I have a bad feeling your
trials are only beginning.

641
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,636
Sir, Mayor Lodge is here.

642
00:40:10,403 --> 00:40:11,803
She'd like to have a word with you.

643
00:40:13,906 --> 00:40:15,172
Tell her I'll be right out.

644
00:40:18,711 --> 00:40:22,213
In the end, why did Warden Norton do it?

645
00:40:23,249 --> 00:40:27,091
Was he afraid of retribution from the
authorities for his illegal activities?

646
00:40:28,288 --> 00:40:32,123
Or was it that the game of G&G
he'd been playing was finally over,

647
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,194
and the Gargoyle King was
calling him home to ascend?

648
00:40:38,665 --> 00:40:41,804
Either way, the result was the same.

649
00:40:41,807 --> 00:40:43,648
Death by cyanide poisoning.

650
