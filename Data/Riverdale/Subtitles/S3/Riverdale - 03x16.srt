[narrator] <i>Previously on </i>Riverdale:

2
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:13,388
I wanna be more than just your errand boy
or casual hookup.

3
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:15,056
I wanna matter, Ronnie.

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,684
I just went through a wrenching breakup.

5
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:19,102
I'm taking things slow.

6
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:20,478
[Josie] Sweet Pea, I told you,

7
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,981
our summer fling was gonna be just that,
a fling.

8
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:24,149
Can I kiss you?

9
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:25,233
Archie.

10
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:28,611
I can't spend all my time
cooped up in that house.

11
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,072
It sounds like you regret
moving in with me.

12
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,659
I've been hearing rumors
that you moved to town

13
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,953
to take the drug trade from Hiram Lodge.

14
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,581
It's about time the Joneses got a taste
of the American Dream.

15
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:40,707
What are you gonna do now?

16
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,668
Protect my dad and run my mom
out of town. Wanna help?

17
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:46,296
-Brother Kevin?
-[Betty] Groups like the Farm

18
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,715
prey on emotionally vulnerable people.

[Cheryl] Midge was murdered
during your production of <i>Carrie.</i>

20
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,886
This year's musical is <i>Heathers.</i>

21
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:53,887
Any questions?

22
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,057
<i>Heathers: the Musical?</i>

23
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:01,644
Now, how in God's name is a play
about teen violence and suicide

24
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,063
a good idea in Riverdale?

25
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,398
Especially after the tragedy
of last year's musical?

26
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,649
Please, Mayor Lodge.

27
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:10,737
Yes, <i>Heathers</i> deals with teen alienation
and desperation.

28
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,365
But its characters long for simpler,
more innocent times.

29
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:17,077
Its ultimate message is a rejection
of nihilism.

30
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,246
If you'll just listen to the lyrics
of the first song. Evelyn?

Before we start today,

135
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:44,677
there's been a slight change
to our creative team.

136
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:48,806
You all know Evelyn Evernever has been
helping me produce the musical.

137
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:52,101
But I've also asked Evelyn to step up
and be my co-director.

138
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,522
Yay. [chuckles] So fun.

139
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,983
What? Kevin.

140
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,278
No. You always direct the musical alone.

141
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,114
Which has been
incredibly stressful, Betty.

142
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,201
Especially after last year's events.

143
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:12,622
[scoffs]
Can we just not talk about Midge, please?

144
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,291
Now, how about we do a rundown
of everybody's parts,

145
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,542
catch Evelyn up to speed?

146
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,544
I'm playing Veronica Sawyer.

147
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,798

turned outcast again.

148
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:22,882
Hi, I'm Sweet Pea.

149
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:28,137
Um, I'm playing JD,
Veronica Sawyer's bad-boy love interest.

doing some theater.

153
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,234
[Kevin] Given how much dancing
there is in <i>Heathers,</i>

154
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,694
Evelyn and I felt
we should bring on a choreographer,

155
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:48,658
so, give a big <i>Heathers</i> hello
to Riverdale's resident Fly Girl,

156
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,118
Toni Topaz.

157

Um, does anyone have a chainsaw?
Because what the...?

159
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:08,052
[Evelyn] Everything in your lives matters.

160
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:13,057
There are universal truths
within each of your personal experiences.

161
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,143
A you inside of me,

162
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,727
a me inside of you.

163
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:21,649
In rehearsal, we are going to explore
our own personal traumas and experiences,

164
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,776
and exorcise them through our art.

165
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,154
[claps]
All right, Cheryl, Veronica, Betty.

166
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,698
"Candy Store" set and costumes are ready.
Go get changed.

167
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:33,953
So, this number is about
the Heathers' undeniable power.

168
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:37,999
Each of you can get anything you want
at any time.

169
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:40,835
So, really unleash that force.

170
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:43,463
We'll start with some simple steps.

171
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:44,589
Yeah, we got it, thanks.

172
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:48,342
Uh, Toni has some fantastic choreo.

173
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,552

Lowering Sweet Pea's solo?

225
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,063
Cute.

226
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:12,194
This entire musical is just one big
recruitment drive for you, isn't it?

227
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,614
I'm sorry, I don't follow.

228
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,325
The Farm is sponsoring the play.

229
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,827
You strong-armed your way
into co-directing.

230
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:24,999
Your warm-up sermons,
exorcising trauma through art.

231
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:27,752
Screams "cult recruitment."

232
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,003
Betty...

233
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,173
dissect these trust issues.

234
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,303
The Farm is producing,

235
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:40,348
and I'm co-directing the musical
for one simple reason.

236
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,850
To have big fun.

237
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,020
In fact...

238
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:48,939
Yeah, okay. Um, ahem.

239
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,192
Everyone, hi. Um...

240
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:54,654
I know that cast parties are usually
after opening night,

241
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:58,616
but the Farm will be hosting
a little get-together tonight

242
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,743
-at the former Sisters of Quiet Mercy.
-Sweet.

243
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:04,997
And, um, I know it may seem
a little weird, or Method-y, but...

244
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:06,707
come in costume.

245
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,125
-Whoo!
-Whoo!

246
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:09,877
Great, Kevin.

247
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,296
-[girl] Totally.
-[boy] Let's go.

248
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,591
Anything big come over the radio today?

249
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:20,763
As a matter of fact, there were a string
of pharmacy break-ins, and, uh...

250
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:27,186
I wasn't sure I was gonna tell you this,
but, uh, Tent City was ransacked.

251
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,438
Our old trailer was stolen.

252
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:35,736
Wait, missing pharmaceuticals,
and a stolen house on wheels?

253
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,823
Doesn't that sound like the makings
of a mobile drug lab?

254
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:39,907
It's possible, sure.

255
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:43,035
I mean, Riverdale's filled
with a lot of desperate folks.

256
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,204
Maybe the Serpents
and I can help you look for it.

257
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,372
What, the trailer?

258
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,874
-Boy, it was worthless.
-Not to me.

259
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:53,838
-That was our home for how many years?
-Too many.

260
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,178
Just popping in to change.

261
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,849
There's a cast party tonight.
Don't wait up.

262
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:05,891
Uh, Veronica...

263
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:08,185
we have to talk.

264
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,816
-Your mother and I are separating.
-What?

265
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,235
No, you're not.

266
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:17,778
Very funny.

267
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:20,990
Um...

268
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,118
I'll be staying
at the Five Seasons indefinitely.

269
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:25,828
Wait. What is happening?

270
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,329
It's already been decided.

271
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,125
We wanted to tell you in person.

272
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:38,591
No, Daddy, whatever this is,
we can figure it out as a family, just...

273
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,093
Can someone please tell me
what's going on?

274
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:44,722
Ask your mother.
[door closes]

275
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,273
Mom?

276
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,861
-He knows, Veronica.
-Knows what?

277
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:00,279
The truth.

278
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,532
He knows I sold the drugs
out from under him

279
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,075
while he was in the hospital.

280
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,004
What are you gonna do?

281
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:18,881
I'm gonna take a bath.

282
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:24,011
You have fun with your friends.

283
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,473

284

-[boy] I'll take one.
-That's the spirit.

288
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,149
Whoo!

289
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:41,028

348
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:57,957
[all] Whoo!

349
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,959
[boy] Woo-hoo!<i> </i>All right.

350
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,670
Can I confess something?

351
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,006
I was afraid
this was never gonna happen again.

352
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:08,592
Me, too.

353
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:12,221
But maybe you and me
are meant to be together.

354
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,597
Maybe we're endgame.

355
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,140
Reggie...

356
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,941
Hungry, Kevin? Here.

357
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:27,903
It's an organic brownie
with Farm-grown maple mushrooms baked in.

358
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,365
-Oh.
-Try it. They're... transformative.

359
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,036
Enjoy the ride.

360
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:37,955
With a big gulp of water.

361
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,373
Fountain's in the hall.

362
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,986
So, last night was big fun.

363
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:12,448
But now it's time to dig deep.

364
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:14,867
So, we're each gonna share something

365
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,036
that we've never told anyone before.

366
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,328
Big or small.

367
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:24,418
So, does no one have a burden
that the rest of us can help shoulder?

368
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,172
I'm being haunted by Midge's ghost.

369
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,966
I've been thinking about her all the time
since rehearsals started.

370
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,468
I just feel so guilty--

371
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,178
I've been seeing her, too.

372
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,930
Not her ghost,

373
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,724
but in nightmares.

374
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:39,641
[chuckles]
How beautiful.

375
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:47,191
Through revealing their truth,
these two young men

376
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:50,861
have found an unexpected connection,
perhaps more.

377
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:52,738
So, um...

378
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:56,241
-Who would like to go next?
-[Sweet Pea] I got something.

379
00:17:56,784 --> 00:18:00,037
Now, I know it was just supposed
to be a summer fling,

380
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,664
and, uh, she didn't want a relationship,
but I did.

381
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:06,210
So, it really blew to see Archie
and Josie getting cozy last night.

382
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:07,169
Arch...

383
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:09,797
are you and Josie dating?

384
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,714
Well, I mean...

385
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:12,883
[Josie] Uh...

386
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:14,843
-[Reggie] Did you know about this?
-What?

387
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,386
No, I had no idea.

388
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,973
The fact that your ex-boo
has a new girlfriend

389
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,684
has nothing to do
with you suddenly being all-in with me?

390
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:23,852
Veronica?

391
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,354
Anything to share?

392
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,068
I just found out
that my parents are separating.

393
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:35,197
My family's unconventional,
to say the least,

394
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,159
but I always thought,
no matter what, they'd stay together.

395
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:45,207
And that is what we,
in the theater, call a breakthrough.

396
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,881
-So, I guess people know about us now.
-Yup.

397
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,592
He's a real class act, that Sweet Pea.

398
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,427
Josie, is it such a bad thing?

399
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,972
Why not make it official?
Why not be boyfriend and girlfriend?

400
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,098
Archie...

401
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:02,432
Okay.

402
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,105
The other day,
when you asked how we got together?

403
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,314
We were lonely.

404
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,233
It's not exactly strong bedrock.

405
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,611
That's what you think we are?
Just lonely souls, filling the void?

406
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,994
So, that's the real reason.

407
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:25,831
You wanted to get back together
'cause your parents are splitsville.

408
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,127
-Why didn't you tell me?
-I wanted to ignore it.

409
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,255
To feel better.

410
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,216
You make me feel better.

411
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,970
I know how it must seem,

412
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:42,848
and I would understand
if you never wanted to talk to me again.

413
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,474
That's not what I'm saying.

414
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,478
And truly, it sucks about your folks.

415
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:53,317
But I don't think this is something
we should be doing right now.

416
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,323
[Reggie sighs]

417
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,128
What's your damage, Child of the Corn?

418
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,425
I just thought you might wanna see
what's happening in the hall.

419
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:26,975
Um, did you have a lobotomy for breakfast?

420
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,435
You're wearing my signature color.

421
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,812
You don't own the color red.

422
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:32,564
Red existed before you.

423
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,066
Not at Riverdale High.

424
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:36,652
Here, I invented red.

425
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,570
I am red.

426
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:43,825
Sorry,

427
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:47,746
but this school's not big enough
for both of us, faux-Pink Lady.

428
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:48,914
And I was here first.

429
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,959
So, go to Centerville High,

430
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,210
or Westerberg.

431
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:54,586
I don't care.

432
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:58,173
But you have until first bell Monday

433
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,260
to clear every trace of yourself
out of these halls.

434
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:03,553

Stop.

470
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:13,517
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have brought you guys here.

471
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:15,852
I can't do this.

472
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,567
[Jughead] Sweet Pea and Fangs
are on musical detail,

473
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,569
but the rest of you have your groups
and grids.

474
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,029
Scour the area, find my trailer.

475
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,073
If I'm right,
it's being used as a drug lab,

476
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,574
and we need to shut it down.

477
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,993

506
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:33,406
You got my text. You came.

507
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,574
Um...

508
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,576
I wanted to talk to you.

509
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,494
Wait.

510
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,330
Can I go first?

511
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,626
Look, if you don't wanna be
in a relationship
because you're not into me,
then that's fine.

512
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,380
But if you do like me...

513
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,466
then let's start figuring out what we are,

514
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:54,010
and what we can be to each other,

515
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:55,303
for real.

516
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,764
Let's clean the slate,
and let's fight for this.

517
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,641
Let's fight for us.

537
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,290
Check that out.

538
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,709
Principal Weatherbee,
<i>Heathers</i> is being used

539
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,878
to indoctrinate students into a cult.

540
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:56,007
It looks like
these two boys are simply rehearsing.

541
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,967
No. No, no.

542
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:01,137
This is part of a religious ceremony.

543
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,180
A ritual.

544
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:05,058
The Farm is a fully sanctioned club,
Ms. Cooper.

545
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:07,769
Approved by me,
after I read Edgar's doctrines,

546
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:11,856
which, I must say,
I found quite fascinating...

547
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:13,650
appealing.

548
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,864
Jug, you'll never believe this.
I think Weatherbee is part of the Farm.

549
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,658
[Jughead] <i>Yeah, well, I have news, too.</i>

550
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:24,119
<i>Can you meet me at Junkyard Steve's, ASAP?</i>

551
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,543
What is that, drain cleaner?

552
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:33,420
No.

553
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:36,756
It's an olive branch.

554
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:44,222
-So, you're here to beg for clemency?
-No.

555
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,057
For us.

556
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,853
What are we doing?
What are we even fighting about?

557
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:55,275
Babe, what was love like in your family?

558
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,154
It was...

559
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:01,990
all-or-nothing.

560
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:07,370
Pure adoration, or distilled hate.

561
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:10,457
Thornhill was a den of shadows.

562
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,709
And J.J. was my only light.

563
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:14,878
Then...

564
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,464
he died.

565
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:19,799
And it was dark again.

566
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:21,885
Until you.

567
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:25,430
And then it felt
like you were disappearing on me.

568
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,432
But I'm not gone.

569
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,143
I'm right here.

570
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,271
And maybe...

571
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,149
it's not too late for us.

572
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,778
[Jughead] Tonsils called it in.

573
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,240
Oh, my God.

574
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,076
This was my childhood home.

575
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,498
My mom destroyed it.

576
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,800
How the hell did we get here?

577
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:08,223
When did our lives go from worrying about
who's gonna sit next to us on the bus

578
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,808
to drug lord mothers?

579
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:13,144
And serial killer fathers.

580
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,689
And unstoppable cults.

581
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:19,692
[Kevin] This is the emotional climax
of the musical.

582
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:22,529
"Seventeen" captures the longing
all the characters feel

583
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:23,738
for what they've lost.

584
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:26,074
Their teen innocence.

585
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:34,833
What are we gonna do?

586
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,757

Maybe we can steal the trailer back,
while everyone's at the play.

623
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,913
Arch can lend me the keys
to his dad's truck,

624
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,124
and I can just move it,
get it out of my mom's hands.

625
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:24,961
Is this idea maybe more emotional
than practical?

626
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:29,132
-Because another thing you could do is--
-What?

627
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,009
You let it go.

628

[Veronica] <i>Come back home, Daddy.</i>

629
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:41,728
So what if Mom tried
to get rid of your drugs?

630
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:45,148
Do you wanna know the real reason
why we're getting a divorce?

631
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,570
I found out that your mother tried
to have me killed.

00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,032
Twice.

633
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,369
I can't believe that.

00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,538
Oh, <i>mija, </i>yes, you can.

635
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:05,376
In fact, I think part of you already knew.

636
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,046
You always say...

637
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:13,051
family is the most important thing.

638
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,135
Family is trust.

639
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,847
You and your mother betrayed me, so...

640
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:20,391
there is no family anymore.

641
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,028
Veronica, your solo's up.

642

687
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:04,847
Little pre-show tradition.

688
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,270
Sign my program later?

689
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,149
-[boy] Hey, Evelyn.
-Hey.

690
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,859
Just... Right here. Thanks.

691
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:18,611
It's ten minutes to places, cast.

692
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:20,154
[all] Thank you, ten.

693
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:41,801
[Josie chuckles]

694
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:45,304
And now for my favorite part.

695
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:46,722
Blot.

696
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:51,894
<i>Parfait, </i>this color was made for you.
We have to get you a tube.

697
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,187
[laughs]

698
00:37:57,066 --> 00:38:00,027
-Where have you been?
-Hi. Sorry. We had to make a quick stop.

699
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:02,280
What is all over your faces? Soot?

700
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:03,739
-Get to makeup, stat.
-Okay.

701
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:06,450
Betty, make sure he knows his line
and choreography for the finale.

702
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:07,743
-Okay.
-My line?

703
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,453
-Yeah.
-I'm not part of the cast.

704
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:12,665
No, it's kind of a big statement song now.
Kevin wants everyone in it.

705
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,166
Don't worry, follow my lead.

706
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,502
It's basically just a costume change.
