00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:49,898
because he drank from
a poisoned chalice,

702
00:36:49,901 --> 00:36:51,851
then who poisoned the cups?

703
00:36:51,854 --> 00:36:53,417
I don't know.

704
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:58,107
His death was ruled a suicide
under suspicious circumstances,

705
00:36:58,109 --> 00:37:00,407
and we never spoke about it

706
00:37:00,409 --> 00:37:03,046
because we knew it must have been
a member of the Midnight Club.

707
00:37:03,049 --> 00:37:04,389
The unthinkable.

708
00:37:04,754 --> 00:37:06,492
One of us was a murderer.

709
00:37:06,495 --> 00:37:09,515
But how did they know that
Featherhead would show up

710
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:11,385
and that he would drink from the cups?

711
00:37:11,388 --> 00:37:12,908
That's what's so terrifying.

712
00:37:13,749 --> 00:37:15,608
The killer couldn't have known.

713
00:37:16,089 --> 00:37:18,927
Which meant whoever poisoned
those cups meant for one of us

714
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:20,828
to drink it at the end of the quest.

715
00:37:20,831 --> 00:37:25,356
So, Featherhead was an
unintentional casualty.

I'm sorry, Mom.

717
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:30,369
But if we are gonna figure out
how to stop what's happening now,

718
00:37:30,372 --> 00:37:32,732
I have a lot more questions.

Elizabeth.

720
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:39,157
When you play the game,

721
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:41,618
the more you talk about it,

722
00:37:42,129 --> 00:37:43,995
the more you think of it,

723
00:37:44,379 --> 00:37:46,623
the more at risk you are.

724
00:37:47,329 --> 00:37:48,734
Mortal risk.

725
00:37:48,737 --> 00:37:50,543
But from what?

726
00:37:51,309 --> 00:37:54,647
People on the outside? The Game Masters?

727

And on the inside, the players.

728
00:37:56,545 --> 00:38:00,886
The game, it gives you
permission to hurt or kill,

729
00:38:00,889 --> 00:38:04,238
themselves, their enemies,

730
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:05,663
their friends.

731
00:38:05,666 --> 00:38:10,886
Ben, Dilton, Ethel, they all willingly
drank the Fresh-Aid drainer chalice quest.

732
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:13,082
But was it murder or suicide?

733
00:38:13,085 --> 00:38:15,355
In the end, it's just death, Betty.

734
00:38:18,315 --> 00:38:21,452
Please promise me you
won't investigate it.

from the Midnight Club?
