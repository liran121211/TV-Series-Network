1
00:00:01,084 --> 00:00:02,449
<i>Previously on</i> Riverdale...

2
00:00:02,527 --> 00:00:04,100
I don't think
I can go back to Riverdale.

3
00:00:04,172 --> 00:00:06,547
<i>Hiram's gonna follow
you, or us, wherever we go.</i>

4
00:00:06,625 --> 00:00:07,901
Where is he?

5
00:00:07,979 --> 00:00:09,100
<i> So, what's the plan?</i>

6
00:00:09,177 --> 00:00:10,274
We'll go see my mom.

7
00:00:10,361 --> 00:00:12,572
<i>Seizures aren't contagious.
So what?</i>

8
00:00:12,652 --> 00:00:15,162
<i>The sisters protected me.
They protected Polly.</i>

9
00:00:15,242 --> 00:00:16,875
<i>They'll watch over you now.</i>

10
00:00:16,994 --> 00:00:18,363
<i>They make drugs
inside the prison,</i>

11
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,297
<i>which all the kids take
when they play G&G.</i>

12
00:00:20,409 --> 00:00:21,649
<i>All of it is
connected, Archie.</i>

13
00:00:21,731 --> 00:00:25,201
<i> What kind of business does Hiram
Lodge have with Sister Woodhouse,</i>

14
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,529
<i>and how are the Blossoms
connected to it?</i>

15
00:00:27,607 --> 00:00:30,697
You've been
a very bad girl, Betty.

16
00:00:30,777 --> 00:00:32,409
<i>You haven't been
taking your candy.</i>

17
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:34,402
Wonderful, wonderful work.

18
00:00:34,544 --> 00:00:36,632
<i> My King, my savior.</i>

19
00:00:39,732 --> 00:00:41,407
<i> It was a day</i>
<i>like any other.</i>

20
00:00:43,459 --> 00:00:45,110
<i>Everything seemed normal.</i>

21
00:00:45,228 --> 00:00:46,858
<i>Students went to class,</i>

22
00:00:47,271 --> 00:00:49,652
<i>the Vixens prepared for
the annual prep rally.</i>

23
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:54,279
<i>Couples had their stolen
moments in quiet classrooms.</i>

24
00:00:55,608 --> 00:00:56,931
You wanna take
another hit?

25
00:00:57,025 --> 00:00:58,400
Less talking,

26
00:00:58,689 --> 00:01:00,479
more kissing.

27
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:03,859
<i>But in Riverdale, there's
no such thing as normal,</i>

28
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:06,199
<i>as Cheryl Blossom was
about to discover.</i>

29
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:17,579
Help! Help us. Somebody help!

30
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:18,964
<i>Your group is stricken,</i>

31
00:01:19,139 --> 00:01:20,999
<i>infected with poison,</i>

32
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,397
compromised.

33
00:01:23,114 --> 00:01:25,589
And now,
you're all alone.

34
00:01:26,091 --> 00:01:29,099
You hear the heavy,
scraping footsteps

35
00:01:29,253 --> 00:01:31,651
of some horrific
monstrosity.

36
00:01:31,787 --> 00:01:34,416
Girls. Time for your candy.

37
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:06,429
Well, this is
definitely the place.

38
00:02:06,761 --> 00:02:08,156
You guys lost?

39
00:02:08,339 --> 00:02:09,969
Or looking to pick up
some merch?

40
00:02:10,224 --> 00:02:11,979
We're looking for
Gladys Jones.

41
00:02:13,093 --> 00:02:14,143
I'm family.

42
00:02:14,221 --> 00:02:15,666
We need a place to stay.

43
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:19,402
- Jughead?
- Jellybean?

44
00:02:20,529 --> 00:02:22,754
Thought I smelled
something rotten.

45
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:27,668
You heard him.
Open the damn gate.

46
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:47,157
You,<i> mon petit amour,</i>
are officially on bed rest.

47
00:02:47,249 --> 00:02:49,842
I've brewed you a pot
of Vintage Narcissus tea,

48
00:02:50,054 --> 00:02:53,305
and our family physician,
Dr. Caligari, is on call

49
00:02:53,469 --> 00:02:55,482
should you feel
another spell coming along.

50
00:02:55,695 --> 00:02:57,856
I'm feeling much better,
Cheryl.

51
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:01,590
But what if what happened
to me is contagious?

52
00:03:01,779 --> 00:03:03,727
Oh, T.T.,

53
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:06,504
Ship's Fever
couldn't keep me away.

54
00:03:06,596 --> 00:03:09,927
My four-poster bed
is your four-poster bed.

55
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:12,284
You can stay here
for as long as you like.

56
00:03:13,529 --> 00:03:17,067
Even... permanently?

57
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:20,187
You mean, like,
move in with you?

58
00:03:20,279 --> 00:03:24,678
I'm cuckoo bananas
for you, obvi.

59
00:03:24,999 --> 00:03:26,674
Won't you move in?

60
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:31,360
As long as
I'm the big spoon.

61
00:03:46,529 --> 00:03:48,428
I believed you, Hiram.

62
00:03:48,506 --> 00:03:50,248
- It's under control.
- No, I supported you,

63
00:03:50,325 --> 00:03:52,829
and you swore to me
that this wouldn't happen.

64
00:03:52,907 --> 00:03:54,670
It was
a miscalculation.

65
00:03:54,827 --> 00:03:56,467
Now, out of strife
comes opportunity,

66
00:03:56,641 --> 00:03:58,042
and now
the timing is perfect.

67
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,758
What is going on?

68
00:04:00,172 --> 00:04:01,482
Why am I back here?

69
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,117
Veronica,

70
00:04:03,316 --> 00:04:05,237
thank God you are awake.

71
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:08,144
We brought you home as soon as
Weatherbee called us.

72
00:04:08,236 --> 00:04:09,604
You had a seizure,<i> mija.</i>

73
00:04:09,744 --> 00:04:10,761
What?

74
00:04:10,839 --> 00:04:12,577
It's all the stress
you've been under.

75
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,824
Getting dropped by Archie,
running two businesses.

76
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,994
Which is why we've decided
to send you to New York.

77
00:04:18,086 --> 00:04:19,877
You'll finally get some rest,

78
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:21,419
and we'll get you in
with the best doctors.

79
00:04:21,496 --> 00:04:23,807
Uh, I'm not leaving town.

80
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:26,137
Sheriff Minetta's body
turns up gangland style,

81
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:27,334
without his hands or head,

82
00:04:27,426 --> 00:04:30,774
and you wanna ship me off
to New York? Why?

83
00:04:32,109 --> 00:04:34,824
No answer? Fascinating.

84
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,407
<i> My parents</i>
<i>are up to something, Reggie.</i>

85
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:40,123
I mean, they're always
up to something,

86
00:04:40,218 --> 00:04:42,987
but they tried
to banish me to New York,

87
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,947
which is a new one for them.

88
00:04:45,025 --> 00:04:49,125
It's like they don't want me
around for whatever's coming next.

89
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:58,731
Has everyone lost their minds?

90
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,877
Is Jingle-Jangle
suddenly a thing again?

91
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:03,457
That was so last year.

92
00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:05,475
I'm not sure it's the Jangle.

93
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:08,047
Your dad's pulling it
off the market

94
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:10,071
and replacing it with
some new candy.

95
00:05:10,168 --> 00:05:11,339
Fizzle Rocks.

96
00:05:11,417 --> 00:05:12,642
Dealt by the Ghoulies?

97
00:05:12,793 --> 00:05:14,927
No. A new gang.

98
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:16,704
The Gargoyles.

99
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:21,334
With ties, no doubt,
to this godforsaken

100
00:05:21,426 --> 00:05:23,527
G&G everyone's playing.

101
00:05:23,619 --> 00:05:27,814
And what, pray tell, is my father's
skin in that particular game, I wonder.

102
00:05:27,906 --> 00:05:31,657
Reggie, I need you to do
some sussing for me

103
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:35,548
and find out what you can
about these Fizzle Rocks.

104
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,207
On it.

105
00:05:37,299 --> 00:05:40,354
Last year, I helped my parents
spin their criminal web

106
00:05:40,446 --> 00:05:44,008
and good people
like Archie got hurt.

107
00:05:44,357 --> 00:05:47,284
This year, I'm going to be
a fly in their ointment.

108
00:05:47,376 --> 00:05:51,144
Whatever they're up to,
I will stop them.

109
00:05:51,489 --> 00:05:53,900
Jughead?

110
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:55,354
Hi, Mom.

111
00:05:59,432 --> 00:06:01,185
Oh, Jug.

112
00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:04,912
Oh!

113
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:08,934
You feel like a...
Like a bag of tire irons.

114
00:06:09,026 --> 00:06:11,237
Are you eating?

115
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:14,014
Ugh, you're not
a vegetarian now, are you?

116
00:06:14,106 --> 00:06:16,408
You wound me, Mother.

117
00:06:18,203 --> 00:06:19,491
Oh...

118
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:22,273
I recognize
that rooster top.

119
00:06:22,351 --> 00:06:24,172
Archie Andrews?

120
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,689
Oh!

121
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:29,781
Gosh, you sure grew up.

122
00:06:30,969 --> 00:06:34,331
Oh! So...

123
00:06:34,619 --> 00:06:37,169
You two finally
got together, huh?

124
00:06:37,247 --> 00:06:39,862
I always knew there was
something going on between you.

125
00:06:40,096 --> 00:06:43,017
Uh, no, we're not
together together.

126
00:06:43,109 --> 00:06:44,909
- We're just on the road together.
- Yeah.

127
00:06:44,986 --> 00:06:47,027
- Like a bromance.
- Sure.

128
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:49,054
I know you didn't come to
Toledo for the weather.

129
00:06:49,146 --> 00:06:50,344
What's going on?

130
00:06:50,436 --> 00:06:53,989
Why didn't you call me,
tell me you were coming?

131
00:06:54,563 --> 00:06:56,758
Last time I called,
you told me I couldn't come.

132
00:06:56,906 --> 00:07:00,008
Well, that was
a different time.

133
00:07:03,001 --> 00:07:06,119
Hey, I got my GED now.

134
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:08,847
Hmm? I started
this whole place up.

135
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:11,137
I am a legit
businesswoman now.

136
00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:15,074
Hey, Gladys, tailpipe just came in
with these. Where do you want 'em?

137
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:18,557
Yeah, not right now, Lugnut.

138
00:07:18,649 --> 00:07:21,517
Oh, hey, hold up.
Get the crew together, huh?

139
00:07:21,609 --> 00:07:23,384
Tell 'em my son's come home.

140
00:07:23,522 --> 00:07:25,138
And his best pal, too.

141
00:07:25,226 --> 00:07:28,277
Tonight,
we are going to feast.

142
00:07:28,424 --> 00:07:29,698
Whoa, yeah!

143
00:07:33,045 --> 00:07:34,710
<i> Betty,</i>
<i>you look terrible.</i>

144
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:36,777
Thank you, Mom.

145
00:07:36,869 --> 00:07:39,634
Did you come here
just to tell me that?

146
00:07:40,589 --> 00:07:43,063
I thought you were
staying at the Farm.

147
00:07:43,456 --> 00:07:46,177
I am, but the school board
reached out.

148
00:07:46,269 --> 00:07:48,499
They're having an emergency
meeting, and I want to be there.

149
00:07:48,576 --> 00:07:50,207
Meeting about what?

150
00:07:50,299 --> 00:07:53,467
Apparently, there was
a mass seizure at school.

151
00:07:53,559 --> 00:07:55,557
Like the same one
that you had.

152
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:58,430
Whatever caused yours
spread to the Vixens.

153
00:07:58,508 --> 00:08:01,028
All of them?
Including Veronica?

154
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:03,109
She's one of the fallen, yes.

155
00:08:03,187 --> 00:08:04,495
Oh, my God.

156
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,437
Poor V.

157
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:09,424
I'm just glad that
you were here, honey.

158
00:08:09,516 --> 00:08:11,704
Safe with the sisters.

159
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:17,824
<i> We have</i>
<i>a very special relationship.</i>

160
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:21,827
He tells me secrets,
gives me personal quests.

161
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,329
And I know people are scared of
him because he's all-powerful,

162
00:08:24,406 --> 00:08:26,997
but he's honestly super-funny.

163
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,364
Who's super-funny?

164
00:08:28,456 --> 00:08:29,667
Oh, hey, Ethel.

165
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,414
I was just
telling everyone about

166
00:08:31,506 --> 00:08:34,654
how the Gargoyle King and I
have gotten really close.

167
00:08:34,746 --> 00:08:36,014
Very funny, Betty.

168
00:08:36,106 --> 00:08:38,727
It's true.
After I met him,

169
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:41,212
I couldn't get him
out of my head, you know?

170
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,114
He's amazing.

171
00:08:43,859 --> 00:08:46,074
Yesterday, he said...

172
00:08:49,099 --> 00:08:50,247
Nevermind.

173
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,655
He said what?

174
00:08:53,721 --> 00:08:55,516
Yesterday, he said

175
00:08:56,329 --> 00:08:58,774
I was his new favorite.

176
00:08:58,866 --> 00:09:01,697
That... That's not possible.

177
00:09:01,789 --> 00:09:04,358
You're not
worthy enough for him.

178
00:09:04,469 --> 00:09:07,725
You're making all this up
to make fun of me, aren't you?

179
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,811
Of course not, Ethel.

180
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:13,357
But if you don't
believe me,

181
00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:15,807
you should go
ask him yourself.

182
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:19,768
Or you and I can go talk to
the Gargoyle King together.

183
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:23,175
You do have the keys
to his chamber, don't you?

184
00:09:28,824 --> 00:09:29,852
What?

185
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,895
Ethel, are you scared?

186
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,074
Everyone is intimidated by a shark. Become
a Card Shark AMERICASCARDROOM.COM

187
00:09:43,669 --> 00:09:44,839
What are you doing?
Open the door!

188
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:46,127
I can't, Ethel,

189
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:49,207
and I'm sorry, but I need
to fast-track my plans,

190
00:09:49,299 --> 00:09:51,092
and you're my best shot
at converting someone.

191
00:09:51,169 --> 00:09:52,679
You're going to make him angry.
You're disrespecting...

192
00:09:52,756 --> 00:09:54,614
The Gargoyle King
isn't real, Ethel.

193
00:09:54,706 --> 00:09:55,967
He's a hallucination.

194
00:09:56,059 --> 00:09:58,424
The candy that the Sisters
have been giving us?

195
00:09:58,516 --> 00:10:00,784
It's a drug,
it's making you see things.

196
00:10:00,876 --> 00:10:02,597
Stop it! Stop lying!

197
00:10:02,689 --> 00:10:06,454
Once the drug wears off in a
few hours, you'll see, okay?

198
00:10:06,546 --> 00:10:08,234
You'll see the truth.

199
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:27,720
Ethel, I'm back.

200
00:10:29,547 --> 00:10:31,342
Are you okay?

201
00:10:32,942 --> 00:10:35,030
I don't understand.

202
00:10:38,099 --> 00:10:40,184
It's just a statue.

203
00:10:41,199 --> 00:10:43,104
But I saw him.

204
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,117
We all did

205
00:10:51,336 --> 00:10:54,854
because we were high
on Fizzle Rocks.

206
00:10:55,141 --> 00:10:57,889
The sisters feed us drugs

207
00:10:57,981 --> 00:11:01,376
that make us susceptible to
visions that they suggest.

208
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,606
They let us play the game,
and then they use

209
00:11:03,698 --> 00:11:06,319
our delusions of
the Gargoyle King

210
00:11:06,411 --> 00:11:08,486
to scare us
into submission.

211
00:11:08,578 --> 00:11:11,071
- That can't be.
- It is.

212
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:15,499
The sisters are running some
kind of scam with Hiram Lodge.

213
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:18,990
I think he's paying them to
test his drugs on the patients.

214
00:11:19,068 --> 00:11:21,936
But I've seen him,
in real life.

215
00:11:22,134 --> 00:11:24,275
In my hospital room.

216
00:11:24,431 --> 00:11:26,016
The Gargoyle King, he...

217
00:11:27,261 --> 00:11:29,660
- He's out there.
- I know.

218
00:11:30,031 --> 00:11:32,687
I saw the Gargoyle King
in town, too,

219
00:11:32,941 --> 00:11:34,629
or someone
dressed up as him.

220
00:11:34,721 --> 00:11:37,706
At any rate, it doesn't
change the fact that in here,

221
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:39,996
he's just a hunk of cement.

222
00:11:42,741 --> 00:11:43,976
I can't believe it.

223
00:11:44,068 --> 00:11:45,689
I need your help, Ethel.

224
00:11:45,781 --> 00:11:49,556
Sister Woodhouse must know more
about G&G than she's letting on.

225
00:11:49,648 --> 00:11:52,669
This game is literally
killing people.

226
00:11:53,411 --> 00:11:56,243
Think about Dilton and Ben.

227
00:11:56,631 --> 00:12:00,756
If we know more, then we can stop
those things from happening again.

228
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:05,049
We just need
Sister Woodhouse to fess up

229
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:08,789
before we can escape
and shut this place down.

230
00:12:08,881 --> 00:12:10,576
How are we going to escape?

231
00:12:10,668 --> 00:12:12,396
First things first.

232
00:12:13,141 --> 00:12:14,806
Sister Woodhouse.

233
00:12:19,257 --> 00:12:21,093
<i>Attention,
students, we are hereby</i>

234
00:12:21,145 --> 00:12:23,101
<i>closing the student lounge.
Please exit immediately...</i>

235
00:12:23,178 --> 00:12:25,809
First, they cancel sports
and extracurriculars,

236
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:28,733
now they're shutting down the lounge?
What is going on?

237
00:12:28,991 --> 00:12:33,000
As Student Body President, please tell me
you've got some insider information to share.

238
00:12:33,397 --> 00:12:37,489
Though my powers as Dauphine of
Riverdale High aren't absolute yet,

239
00:12:37,581 --> 00:12:39,859
I am CC'd on
all School Board emails.

240
00:12:39,951 --> 00:12:41,898
And they're having
a meeting tonight.

241
00:12:42,148 --> 00:12:44,739
I think to discuss
shutting down the school.

242
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:47,536
And, Veronica, your parents
are leading the charge.

243
00:12:47,628 --> 00:12:48,954
Of course they are.

244
00:12:49,032 --> 00:12:51,487
That is exactly what my dad
did with Southside High,

245
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,038
and he definitely had
ulterior motives then.

246
00:12:54,178 --> 00:12:55,493
Oh, my God.

247
00:12:57,431 --> 00:12:59,616
And now Riverdale High
is officially a hot zone?

248
00:13:05,531 --> 00:13:07,946
- That's one of the infected.
- Go, Veronica, run.

249
00:13:11,321 --> 00:13:13,209
Drugs, gargoyles,

250
00:13:13,301 --> 00:13:15,369
mystery men
in hazmat suits,

251
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,756
and secret
School Board meetings?

252
00:13:16,848 --> 00:13:18,446
How does it all tie together?

253
00:13:18,538 --> 00:13:21,449
Not sure,
but I got some suss for you.

254
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:22,936
According to my sources,

255
00:13:23,028 --> 00:13:26,959
the Fizzle Rocks distributors,
aka the Gargoyles,

256
00:13:27,051 --> 00:13:29,186
are giving their product
out to people for free.

257
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:32,318
I've seen enough episodes of
<i>Narcos"</i> to know this scheme.

258
00:13:32,818 --> 00:13:34,239
Hook them with a first taste,

259
00:13:34,348 --> 00:13:36,469
then they're
customers for life.

260
00:13:36,561 --> 00:13:38,666
And Daddy's always
playing the long game.

261
00:13:38,758 --> 00:13:40,636
For sure,
and here's the kicker.

262
00:13:40,728 --> 00:13:43,239
Fizzle Rocks are coming
from the Southside,

263
00:13:43,331 --> 00:13:45,899
right out of the prison
your dad's been building.

264
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,266
That must be where
he moved his candy factory to

265
00:13:48,358 --> 00:13:49,569
after Cheryl, Toni, and I

266
00:13:49,661 --> 00:13:51,596
- busted his lab at the Whyte Wyrm.
- Hmm.

267
00:13:51,688 --> 00:13:53,576
And speaking of Cheryl...

268
00:13:56,391 --> 00:14:01,569
Cheryl? What time is that
School Board meeting and where?

269
00:14:01,661 --> 00:14:04,419
No child should step foot
through these doors

270
00:14:04,526 --> 00:14:08,854
until we have figured out what's going on
in this toxic petri dish of contagion.

271
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,476
We're taking as many precautions
as we can, Mrs. Blossom.

272
00:14:11,568 --> 00:14:14,592
What we should be doing is
tracking down patient zero

273
00:14:14,735 --> 00:14:17,009
and running every test
in Western medicine on them.

274
00:14:17,101 --> 00:14:20,480
Okay, tonight's discussion is
regarding the fate of Riverdale High.

275
00:14:20,558 --> 00:14:21,930
Can we please stay on topic?

276
00:14:22,031 --> 00:14:23,526
To Mrs. Blossom's point,

277
00:14:23,618 --> 00:14:26,546
my wife and I are in full agreement.
Most parents are.

278
00:14:26,638 --> 00:14:30,796
I mean, five more kids experienced
seizures just this afternoon.

279
00:14:30,888 --> 00:14:32,536
Isn't that right, Waldo?

280
00:14:33,447 --> 00:14:34,489
Yeah.

281
00:14:34,581 --> 00:14:37,149
Which is why
tonight, as mayor,

282
00:14:37,241 --> 00:14:39,289
I am signing
an executive order

283
00:14:39,381 --> 00:14:41,029
shutting down Riverdale High,

284
00:14:41,121 --> 00:14:42,486
at least until
it's deemed safe.

285
00:14:42,578 --> 00:14:44,529
Stop it right there!

286
00:14:44,621 --> 00:14:47,890
The CDC hasn't set foot
in Riverdale High. -Fact!

287
00:14:48,056 --> 00:14:51,344
And now my parents are bullying
you all into closing it.

288
00:14:51,634 --> 00:14:54,347
Sounds exactly like what you
did with Southside High,

289
00:14:54,546 --> 00:14:56,369
which you're now
using as a drug factory.

290
00:14:56,461 --> 00:14:58,091
Wait a minute. I thought
Southside High property

291
00:14:58,168 --> 00:15:00,076
was being developed
into a prison.

292
00:15:00,168 --> 00:15:02,259
That's just his cover,
Mrs. Cooper.

293
00:15:02,351 --> 00:15:04,346
Is that your plan here,
too, Daddy?

294
00:15:04,438 --> 00:15:08,269
Trump up a way to get another
huge parcel of land on the cheap,

295
00:15:08,361 --> 00:15:10,876
then expand your
ever-growing drug empire,

296
00:15:10,968 --> 00:15:14,309
which now consists, almost
exclusively, of Fizzle Rocks?

297
00:15:14,401 --> 00:15:16,876
Veronica, what are you
even talking about?

298
00:15:16,968 --> 00:15:18,619
That's okay,<i> mi amor.</i>

299
00:15:18,831 --> 00:15:20,756
There's a reason
for this meeting, right?

300
00:15:20,911 --> 00:15:22,466
To air out concerns.

301
00:15:22,558 --> 00:15:24,609
We called the CDC.

302
00:15:24,701 --> 00:15:28,449
They wouldn't send anyone to investigate
such a low priority crisis.

303
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,226
They think
it's all psychological.

304
00:15:30,318 --> 00:15:32,249
So, we took some initiative.

305
00:15:32,341 --> 00:15:34,039
The men you saw
in hazmat gear,

306
00:15:34,131 --> 00:15:37,446
they were hired from a private
firm to run exhaustive tests.

307
00:15:37,538 --> 00:15:40,236
And Southside High
is becoming a prison,

308
00:15:40,328 --> 00:15:42,169
not a drug factory.

309
00:15:42,261 --> 00:15:44,341
If you'd like the names of the
guards we've recently hired,

310
00:15:44,418 --> 00:15:46,066
I'd happily provide a list.

311
00:15:48,221 --> 00:15:49,736
Have I left anything out?

312
00:15:52,795 --> 00:15:55,083
Yes, you have.

313
00:15:55,231 --> 00:15:57,636
The part about how
you're producing Fizzle Rocks

314
00:15:57,728 --> 00:15:59,136
and giving it away for free

315
00:15:59,228 --> 00:16:01,786
to get every teenager
in Riverdale hooked.

316
00:16:02,825 --> 00:16:05,048
And I suppose I'm also
the Gargoyle King,

317
00:16:05,213 --> 00:16:07,798
as Jughead Jones accused me of being?

318
00:16:08,018 --> 00:16:10,199
Oh, poor deluded girl.

319
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:13,486
I hear tell that these
seizures cause hallucinations,

320
00:16:13,578 --> 00:16:16,826
and isn't this child
one of the afflicted?

321
00:16:16,918 --> 00:16:20,238
On that note,
where are the cheerleaders?

322
00:16:20,421 --> 00:16:22,496
I speak for
the disappeared Vixens.

323
00:16:22,588 --> 00:16:23,729
What of them?

324
00:16:23,821 --> 00:16:25,181
Where were they taken?
And by whom?

325
00:16:25,258 --> 00:16:28,009
Those girls went to
Riverdale General

326
00:16:28,101 --> 00:16:30,407
where I'm sure they're receiving
the best medical care possible.

327
00:16:30,484 --> 00:16:33,135
And being dissected like
fetal pigs, no doubt!

328
00:16:33,241 --> 00:16:35,706
You messed with my squad, which
means you messed with me.

329
00:16:35,798 --> 00:16:38,012
Now I demand real answers!

330
00:16:41,202 --> 00:16:42,700
What?

331
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:44,056
What is it, you viper?

332
00:16:55,956 --> 00:16:57,669
Hiram Lodge, huh?

333
00:16:57,761 --> 00:17:00,166
That good-looking short stack
was always trouble.

334
00:17:00,258 --> 00:17:02,006
But why go after Archie?

335
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,916
Archie was the only one that
stood up to him, defied him.

336
00:17:07,008 --> 00:17:09,066
Not to mention, I also date...

337
00:17:09,681 --> 00:17:10,996
Dated his daughter.

338
00:17:11,088 --> 00:17:12,189
Oh.

339
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,759
"Dated"?
As in, no longer dating?

340
00:17:14,851 --> 00:17:16,646
- As in, single?
- Relax, Jellybean.

341
00:17:16,738 --> 00:17:18,626
It's JB now, Kid Kerouac.

342
00:17:18,718 --> 00:17:20,979
Archie.

343
00:17:21,071 --> 00:17:23,672
Have you spoken to your dad
through any of this?

344
00:17:24,934 --> 00:17:28,939
I wish.
I wish I could... see him,

345
00:17:29,701 --> 00:17:31,069
tell him how I'm doing.

346
00:17:31,161 --> 00:17:33,799
But it's too risky. He'd
drag me home by the collar.

347
00:17:33,891 --> 00:17:35,626
Riverdale's not where
I need to be.

348
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:39,396
Pig's ready!

349
00:17:39,561 --> 00:17:41,041
All right.
You heard the guy.

350
00:17:41,118 --> 00:17:43,406
Archie, go get yourself
a hot meal.

351
00:17:43,498 --> 00:17:45,016
Cheek's the best part.

352
00:17:50,431 --> 00:17:52,679
All right,

353
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:54,679
so tell me about
this game thing.

354
00:17:54,771 --> 00:17:56,876
This thing that you and
Archie are mixed up in.

355
00:17:56,968 --> 00:17:58,256
Gryphons and Gargoyles?

356
00:17:58,348 --> 00:18:00,139
How involved with this
are you?

357
00:18:00,231 --> 00:18:01,676
Well, it's more than
just a game.

358
00:18:01,768 --> 00:18:04,176
It's got larger implications
for all of Riverdale.

359
00:18:04,268 --> 00:18:06,749
I'm just trying to crack it.
Get underneath it.

360
00:18:06,841 --> 00:18:08,446
Figure out
who's behind all this.

361
00:18:08,975 --> 00:18:11,453
Hiram, it sounds like.

362
00:18:12,221 --> 00:18:15,359
Is he the one who gave you
that nasty scar on your arm?

363
00:18:15,451 --> 00:18:17,056
- You saw that, huh?
- Yeah, it's bad.

364
00:18:17,155 --> 00:18:19,162
No, that was, uh...

365
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:27,910
<i>audio not proper...</i>
..any the quench?

366
00:18:27,988 --> 00:18:30,046
So, she always had a beef
about your father and I.

367
00:18:30,138 --> 00:18:32,145
And then she does this?
She cuts up my son?

368
00:18:32,223 --> 00:18:34,487
You know, I never wanted this
for you, kid.

369
00:18:34,565 --> 00:18:36,169
I mean, you're Serpent King.

370
00:18:36,206 --> 00:18:38,196
I never wanted you
in the damn gang.

371
00:18:38,235 --> 00:18:43,393
Don't act all
high and mighty.

372
00:18:43,481 --> 00:18:46,189
I saw that kid
with the stereos earlier.

373
00:18:46,267 --> 00:18:48,338
You claimed to have left Riverdale
to get away from Serpent life,

374
00:18:48,415 --> 00:18:51,476
and here you are, chopping
cars and lifting their parts,

375
00:18:51,568 --> 00:18:54,209
- God knows what else.
- Hey.

376
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:57,633
So what? So if we jack a
couple stereos here and there

377
00:18:57,711 --> 00:18:59,159
and we steal some hubcaps?

378
00:18:59,251 --> 00:19:01,576
I am feeding and taking care
of all these kids

379
00:19:01,668 --> 00:19:03,129
who have nowhere else to go.

380
00:19:03,221 --> 00:19:05,999
What am I supposed to do?
Just leave 'em high and dry?

381
00:19:06,091 --> 00:19:07,791
It's what you did to me,
isn't it?

382
00:19:12,231 --> 00:19:14,166
Come on, let's get
something to eat

383
00:19:14,258 --> 00:19:16,160
before there's something left.

384
00:19:29,662 --> 00:19:31,835
Surprised to see me, Red?

385
00:19:33,491 --> 00:19:34,926
There's a bounty on your hip,

386
00:19:35,018 --> 00:19:37,026
and you left more
breadcrumbs coming here

387
00:19:37,118 --> 00:19:39,246
than a chubby kid
in a fairytale.

388
00:19:39,358 --> 00:19:41,026
Red, keep quiet,

389
00:19:41,104 --> 00:19:43,429
I'll give you the luxury
of an open casket.

390
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:46,571
Not if I
put you in one first.

391
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,049
Drop the butter knife, bitch.

392
00:19:53,141 --> 00:19:55,978
Careful, kid, you might
poke your eye out.

393
00:20:08,484 --> 00:20:11,862
You know, Penny, I'm not shocked
that a bottom-feeder like you

394
00:20:11,957 --> 00:20:13,896
is working with Hiram Lodge.

395
00:20:13,988 --> 00:20:16,804
You always had
unfixed allegiances.

396
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:21,474
That's rich,
coming from Gladys Jones.

397
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:22,801
Yeah, well...

398
00:20:22,879 --> 00:20:25,804
I am surprised that you're not
ratting him out right now.

399
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:29,498
He must have something
real good on you, Penny-slot.

400
00:20:29,838 --> 00:20:31,306
I'm no snitch.

401
00:20:31,466 --> 00:20:33,151
But I will say this,

402
00:20:33,418 --> 00:20:35,396
Hiram won't stop.

403
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,357
Not till he gets
what he wants.

404
00:20:38,561 --> 00:20:40,469
And right now, that's Red.

405
00:20:40,561 --> 00:20:44,386
And there's nothing that you, or
your little <i>Lord of the Flies</i> crew,

406
00:20:44,478 --> 00:20:46,826
or Jughead here can do.

407
00:20:47,441 --> 00:20:50,619
Hiram won't stop.

408
00:20:50,711 --> 00:20:53,150
Speaking of my Jug,

409
00:20:53,361 --> 00:20:56,026
I saw the work that
you did on him.

410
00:20:56,118 --> 00:20:59,339
You carved him up
like a Sunday roast.

411
00:20:59,431 --> 00:21:01,536
That was business
between me and him.

412
00:21:01,628 --> 00:21:03,659
Yeah, well, I'm his mama.

413
00:21:03,751 --> 00:21:05,426
So it's between
me and you now.

414
00:21:12,851 --> 00:21:17,429
All right, everyone,
go inside,

415
00:21:17,521 --> 00:21:20,196
me and Penny here, we're gonna
have us a little girl talk.

416
00:21:20,288 --> 00:21:21,686
Ask her about G&G,

417
00:21:22,831 --> 00:21:24,566
how Hiram fits into it all.

418
00:21:25,191 --> 00:21:26,526
Roger that.

419
00:21:32,227 --> 00:21:33,682
I wanted
to commend you.

420
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,214
The gusto you showed
in that meeting,

421
00:21:37,871 --> 00:21:39,376
that was audacious.

422
00:21:40,121 --> 00:21:42,126
- Congratulations.
- On what?

423
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:44,109
On being right.

424
00:21:44,201 --> 00:21:47,459
About all of it.
Or at least most of it.

425
00:21:47,551 --> 00:21:50,646
I mean, it's so much bigger than
you're giving me credit for.

426
00:21:50,738 --> 00:21:52,896
This plan? What's coming next?

427
00:21:52,988 --> 00:21:55,476
It's practically biblical.

428
00:21:56,361 --> 00:21:57,749
Years in the making.

429
00:21:57,841 --> 00:21:59,316
What is it?

430
00:22:00,401 --> 00:22:01,996
What do you
really want, Daddy?

431
00:22:02,088 --> 00:22:03,856
What every king wants.

432
00:22:04,571 --> 00:22:05,571
A kingdom.

433
00:22:06,771 --> 00:22:08,439
And a legacy.

434
00:22:08,531 --> 00:22:10,526
You know,
once things are in place,

435
00:22:11,571 --> 00:22:13,729
I'm hoping you'll join me.

436
00:22:13,821 --> 00:22:15,349
Take a seat
at my right hand

437
00:22:15,441 --> 00:22:17,286
and help me oversee
the new order.

438
00:22:21,531 --> 00:22:23,336
You're deluded, Daddy.

439
00:22:24,501 --> 00:22:27,546
Also, you're not untouchable.

440
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:30,619
Maybe in Riverdale you are,

441
00:22:30,711 --> 00:22:34,306
because your wife's mayor
and there's no sheriff,

442
00:22:35,191 --> 00:22:38,476
but there's a whole
wide world out there.

443
00:22:39,221 --> 00:22:40,746
They"ll see
what you're doing.

444
00:22:42,531 --> 00:22:44,686
Yeah, I'm not
too concerned about that.

445
00:22:46,351 --> 00:22:48,957
You know, it's been a while
since I've seen you in pearls.

446
00:22:50,601 --> 00:22:52,486
Maybe you'll start
wearing them again.

447
00:22:55,571 --> 00:22:57,199
Hey.

448
00:22:57,291 --> 00:22:59,609
- What happened with Penny?
- Just

449
00:22:59,701 --> 00:23:01,306
give me a second, Jug, okay?

450
00:23:01,398 --> 00:23:03,746
Let me think.
I just need to think.

451
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:07,266
- She talk about the game?
- Jug, come on.

452
00:23:07,358 --> 00:23:09,576
We know she was
tracking Archie for Hiram.

453
00:23:09,668 --> 00:23:11,619
Was it a quest
from her master?

454
00:23:11,711 --> 00:23:14,091
Is Hiram more than the Man in Black?
Is he the Gargoyle King?

455
00:23:14,168 --> 00:23:16,666
You are so caught up
in this damn game,

456
00:23:16,758 --> 00:23:19,866
you can't see
three feet in front of you.

457
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:22,766
The big prize
isn't Archie's head,

458
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:24,969
it is Riverdale.

459
00:23:25,061 --> 00:23:27,559
Jug, if you had
your wits about you,

460
00:23:27,651 --> 00:23:30,559
you would realize that
Hiram chased you out of town

461
00:23:30,651 --> 00:23:32,559
just to get you
off of the chess board.

462
00:23:32,651 --> 00:23:35,826
So you were as far away from
Riverdale when he made his big play.

463
00:23:37,131 --> 00:23:39,136
So it's not about
ascending to the Kingdom?

464
00:23:40,491 --> 00:23:41,966
It's about
claiming the Kingdom.

465
00:23:42,058 --> 00:23:44,279
And if Hiram is
the Gargoyle King,

466
00:23:44,371 --> 00:23:47,489
then he is responsible for
re-introducing G&G to Riverdale

467
00:23:47,581 --> 00:23:48,806
and the deaths of those kids.

468
00:23:48,898 --> 00:23:50,569
Mrs. J, what do we do?

469
00:23:50,661 --> 00:23:52,746
I'm still trying
to figure that out, sweetie.

470
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,056
Are we okay here?

471
00:23:57,431 --> 00:23:58,616
I mean, is Archie even safe?

472
00:23:58,708 --> 00:24:01,726
Yeah, of course he is.

473
00:24:11,361 --> 00:24:13,309
- Hello?
- V?

474
00:24:13,401 --> 00:24:15,556
It's Betty. It's so good
to hear your voice.

475
00:24:15,648 --> 00:24:18,019
- Girl, where are you?
<i>- It's a long story,</i>

476
00:24:18,111 --> 00:24:20,519
but I'm at The Sisters
of Quiet Mercy. <i>-What?</i>

477
00:24:20,611 --> 00:24:22,216
We all thought
you were at the Farm.

478
00:24:22,308 --> 00:24:24,476
Veronica,
there's not much time.

479
00:24:24,568 --> 00:24:27,329
You need to listen to me
very carefully.

480
00:24:27,421 --> 00:24:28,831
<i> Your text said</i>
<i>you had news.</i>

481
00:24:28,908 --> 00:24:32,176
Betty called. She's at The
Sisters of Quiet Mercy.

482
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:34,759
What?

483
00:24:34,851 --> 00:24:36,671
That place is the Hellmouth of Riverdale.
We have to break her out of there.

484
00:24:36,748 --> 00:24:38,299
Betty said
she's working on that,

485
00:24:38,391 --> 00:24:39,511
but you and I have
another mission.

486
00:24:39,588 --> 00:24:41,169
According to B,

487
00:24:41,261 --> 00:24:42,749
my father's
testing Fizzle Rocks

488
00:24:42,841 --> 00:24:44,756
on the patients
at The Sisters of Quiet Mercy.

489
00:24:44,848 --> 00:24:47,839
Moreover, she saw
your Uncle Claudius with him,

490
00:24:47,931 --> 00:24:50,929
using Blossom Maple trucks
to deliver the drugs.

491
00:24:51,021 --> 00:24:52,649
Shades of
the Legion of Doom.

492
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,676
They're planning
something big, Cheryl.

493
00:24:54,768 --> 00:24:56,676
My father likened it
to the apocalypse.

494
00:24:56,768 --> 00:24:58,209
For all we know,

495
00:24:58,301 --> 00:25:00,816
my father may somehow be
responsible for the seizures,

496
00:25:00,908 --> 00:25:03,579
but he wouldn't be
any more specific than that.

497
00:25:03,671 --> 00:25:05,856
So I was thinking maybe
we could ask your mom,

498
00:25:05,948 --> 00:25:07,486
since she's in cahoots
with him?

499
00:25:08,331 --> 00:25:10,159
With pleasure, Veronica.

500
00:25:10,251 --> 00:25:12,999
My Vixens have fallen.
My T.T. has fallen.

501
00:25:13,091 --> 00:25:16,826
If my gorgon-like mother has any knowledge
of how or why that's happening,

502
00:25:16,918 --> 00:25:18,216
we'll get it out of her.

503
00:25:26,271 --> 00:25:27,439
Hi, Sister. Sorry.

504
00:25:27,531 --> 00:25:29,336
I was wondering
if I could get some...

505
00:25:34,181 --> 00:25:36,456
Don't scream, Sister.

506
00:25:36,548 --> 00:25:37,689
Oh, sorry.

507
00:25:37,781 --> 00:25:39,826
You're coming with me.

508
00:25:40,901 --> 00:25:43,746
It's time we pay
a little visit to your King.

509
00:26:02,588 --> 00:26:04,766
It's just me. Get up.

510
00:26:06,311 --> 00:26:09,016
I didn't want to talk in front
of Archie and the others.

511
00:26:09,981 --> 00:26:11,719
As it turns out,

512
00:26:11,811 --> 00:26:14,086
Peabody had a lot to say.

513
00:26:14,178 --> 00:26:18,899
The bounty on your pal Archie,
it's not just on him.

514
00:26:18,991 --> 00:26:22,899
It's on anyone who's with him
or is helping him.

515
00:26:22,991 --> 00:26:26,689
Which means there is a target
on your back now, too, Jughead.

516
00:26:26,781 --> 00:26:28,676
It's the same if he goes
back to Riverdale.

517
00:26:28,768 --> 00:26:30,756
Archie's dad,
Archie's friends,

518
00:26:30,848 --> 00:26:32,529
everyone is at risk,

519
00:26:32,621 --> 00:26:34,106
which is why
you got to cut him loose.

520
00:26:34,198 --> 00:26:36,446
I'm not just gonna
ditch Archie, Mom.

521
00:26:36,538 --> 00:26:37,989
He's my best friend.

522
00:26:38,081 --> 00:26:39,676
Your mom's right, Jug.

523
00:26:42,681 --> 00:26:44,719
You got me this far.

524
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:46,391
That's more than anyone else
would've done.

525
00:26:46,468 --> 00:26:47,709
You can go home.

526
00:26:47,801 --> 00:26:49,209
What are you talking about?

527
00:26:49,301 --> 00:26:50,586
You can't go
out there alone.

528
00:26:50,678 --> 00:26:52,889
Jug, Hiram almost killed us
back at that farm,

529
00:26:52,981 --> 00:26:54,626
Penny tracked us here
to your mom's.

530
00:26:54,718 --> 00:26:56,099
I've put her in danger.

531
00:26:56,191 --> 00:26:58,636
I've put Jellybean in danger.
I can't keep doing that.

532
00:26:59,561 --> 00:27:02,806
Wherever I go next,
it's got to be alone.

533
00:27:02,898 --> 00:27:04,326
- Archie.
- Jug.

534
00:27:12,801 --> 00:27:14,126
All right.

535
00:27:15,331 --> 00:27:17,049
So, it's decided.

536
00:27:17,141 --> 00:27:18,421
Arch, we'll get you
a ride to the border.

537
00:27:18,498 --> 00:27:19,781
I know a guy up there
who can help.

538
00:27:19,858 --> 00:27:22,716
Jughead, you can stay here
as long as you want.

539
00:27:25,891 --> 00:27:27,386
No, I think
I need to go home.

540
00:27:29,221 --> 00:27:30,976
Hiram Lodge needs
to get taken down.

541
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:33,996
It's only gonna happen
from the inside.

542
00:27:37,071 --> 00:27:38,816
You sinful girls.

543
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:43,116
I will strap you to your beds and
electroshock the sin out of you.

544
00:27:44,241 --> 00:27:48,769
Sister, monsters don't scare
me, and neither do you.

545
00:27:48,861 --> 00:27:51,606
I've seen real darkness. I've
stared it right in the face.

546
00:27:51,698 --> 00:27:53,569
That's why
you couldn't break me.

547
00:27:53,661 --> 00:27:55,356
I know the scam
that you're running.

548
00:27:55,448 --> 00:27:56,946
I saw you with Hiram Lodge.

549
00:27:57,038 --> 00:28:00,096
You're testing his drugs
out on patients.

550
00:28:00,188 --> 00:28:01,499
Why?

551
00:28:01,591 --> 00:28:04,409
Mr. Lodge is
a generous donor.

552
00:28:04,501 --> 00:28:06,579
- Oh?
- A believer in our mission.

553
00:28:06,671 --> 00:28:08,146
And by "mission", you mean

554
00:28:08,238 --> 00:28:12,056
using the game and the
Gargoyle King to scare girls?

555
00:28:12,531 --> 00:28:14,309
To torture children?

556
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:17,629
The children who come
through our doors are broken.

557
00:28:17,721 --> 00:28:19,826
It's our sacred mission
to fix them,

558
00:28:19,918 --> 00:28:22,259
using whatever tools
necessary.

559
00:28:22,351 --> 00:28:25,906
Does that mean that the sisters
created Gryphons and Gargoyles

560
00:28:27,071 --> 00:28:28,171
as a tool?

561
00:28:31,211 --> 00:28:34,466
Misbehaving children have been
brought down to this room

562
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:36,739
since the asylum opened.

563
00:28:36,831 --> 00:28:39,869
That statue scared them
into submission.

564
00:28:39,961 --> 00:28:42,566
Some of them,
the more disturbed ones,

565
00:28:42,658 --> 00:28:44,326
created a fantasy realm,

566
00:28:44,418 --> 00:28:45,969
a game

567
00:28:46,061 --> 00:28:48,596
to cope with the fear
of the one they'd named

568
00:28:49,471 --> 00:28:51,016
the Gargoyle King.

569
00:28:52,441 --> 00:28:55,266
We embraced it
as a therapeutic tool.

570
00:28:55,551 --> 00:28:56,889
And it worked

571
00:28:56,981 --> 00:29:00,326
because it embeds itself
in the minds of the players.

572
00:29:00,418 --> 00:29:03,139
It makes them complacent.
Focuses them.

573
00:29:03,231 --> 00:29:06,516
If that's true, then how did the
game get out into the world?

574
00:29:06,608 --> 00:29:08,046
Did you give it to Hiram?

575
00:29:08,138 --> 00:29:10,666
It was never meant
to leave these walls.

576
00:29:10,758 --> 00:29:12,376
It's too powerful.

577
00:29:12,468 --> 00:29:14,519
A game born of madness.

578
00:29:14,611 --> 00:29:17,169
A madness you helped nurture.

579
00:29:17,261 --> 00:29:19,386
And now people like
Ben and Dilton are dead.

580
00:29:19,478 --> 00:29:22,699
You're going to pay for everything
that you've done, Sister.

581
00:29:22,791 --> 00:29:24,706
And you're going
to tell the authorities

582
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:26,846
what you've told us
about the game.

583
00:29:27,631 --> 00:29:29,766
And about Hiram's donations.

584
00:29:31,461 --> 00:29:35,589
I only answer
to one authority, Betty.

585
00:29:35,681 --> 00:29:38,196
Come on, Ethel.
We have her keys.

586
00:29:38,288 --> 00:29:39,839
We're leaving.

587
00:29:39,931 --> 00:29:42,379
We're taking your children
with us, Sister.

588
00:29:42,471 --> 00:29:43,796
They won't want to leave.

589
00:29:44,621 --> 00:29:46,316
We'll see about that.

590
00:29:50,611 --> 00:29:51,716
Help!

591
00:29:51,808 --> 00:29:53,039
Help!

592
00:29:53,131 --> 00:29:55,496
I'm in the basement.

593
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,211
Help!

594
00:29:59,858 --> 00:30:02,209
Let's do this again.

595
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:05,219
What does my father
have planned for Riverdale?

596
00:30:05,311 --> 00:30:07,356
Speak!
Or it gets the syrup again.

597
00:30:09,078 --> 00:30:13,369
Why do you want to know
your father's plans?

598
00:30:13,461 --> 00:30:17,816
He's finally going to turn this
backwater into something worthwhile.

599
00:30:17,908 --> 00:30:20,639
A place where
we can all pursue

600
00:30:20,731 --> 00:30:25,069
- our various enterprises unmolested.
- What does that mean?

601
00:30:25,161 --> 00:30:28,456
She's talking about
drug dealing and prostitution.

602
00:30:28,548 --> 00:30:30,656
Aren't you, you ghoulunatic?

603
00:30:37,991 --> 00:30:39,496
We need specifics.

604
00:30:40,751 --> 00:30:44,616
How exactly is my father
planning on turning Riverdale

605
00:30:44,708 --> 00:30:45,936
into Vice City?

606
00:30:46,028 --> 00:30:49,499
Well, he's in bed
with the mayor, isn't he?

607
00:30:49,591 --> 00:30:51,976
And as for
law enforcement, well,

608
00:30:52,068 --> 00:30:54,339
the last time I checked,

609
00:30:54,431 --> 00:30:56,636
Riverdale didn't have
much of a sheriff.

610
00:30:58,531 --> 00:31:01,249
Details. Or so help me God,

611
00:31:01,341 --> 00:31:03,629
I will drown you
in this cheap crap.

612
00:31:03,721 --> 00:31:05,986
And open the garden doors
to let the ants in.

613
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:10,819
All right, I'll tell you.

614
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:13,556
Wait. What do you mean,
you don't want to escape?

615
00:31:13,648 --> 00:31:14,886
We feel safe here.

616
00:31:14,978 --> 00:31:16,269
We play G&G.

617
00:31:16,361 --> 00:31:19,769
The sisters give us candy,
keep us warm and clean.

618
00:31:19,861 --> 00:31:21,456
Why would we
wanna leave?

619
00:31:25,581 --> 00:31:26,986
Sister Woodhouse was right.

620
00:31:27,078 --> 00:31:29,156
They're all brainwashed,
just like I was.

621
00:31:29,248 --> 00:31:31,379
Well, we can't just
leave them behind.

622
00:31:31,471 --> 00:31:34,646
Not to mention all those kids in the
gay conversion wing where Cheryl was.

623
00:31:34,738 --> 00:31:37,596
There has to be
something we can do.

624
00:31:38,811 --> 00:31:41,049
Wait, the game.

625
00:31:41,141 --> 00:31:44,509
The game is how they cope
with terror, right?

626
00:31:44,601 --> 00:31:47,986
So, let's convince them to escape
by turning it into a quest.

627
00:31:48,821 --> 00:31:51,536
The Gargoyle King
inspires fear,

628
00:31:51,628 --> 00:31:53,729
so let's give them hope.

629
00:31:53,821 --> 00:31:56,546
Let's give them the opposite of
the Gargoyle King, which is...

630
00:31:56,638 --> 00:31:57,936
The Gryphon Queen.

631
00:32:06,911 --> 00:32:08,529
All right.

632
00:32:08,621 --> 00:32:11,516
Now, I packed you guys
some lunches for the road.

633
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:16,056
Hey, Jug, you mind getting that?
It's probably Archie's ride.

634
00:32:24,811 --> 00:32:25,861
Dad!

635
00:32:27,721 --> 00:32:29,426
I've missed you
so much, Dad.

636
00:32:29,518 --> 00:32:31,236
Me too, son.

637
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,129
So you finally made it, huh?

638
00:32:45,221 --> 00:32:47,666
Jughead's getting his bag.
He'll be out in a minute.

639
00:32:48,791 --> 00:32:50,126
Hey, Jellybelly.

640
00:32:51,141 --> 00:32:52,676
You've gotten so big.

641
00:32:54,721 --> 00:32:56,046
Can I get a hug?

642
00:32:56,311 --> 00:32:57,326
Can I get a dad?

643
00:32:57,418 --> 00:32:58,691
Hey, JB!

644
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:00,369
Come on now.

645
00:33:00,461 --> 00:33:02,096
Let her be. I deserve that.

646
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,839
She misses you.

647
00:33:04,931 --> 00:33:07,256
She'd just rather fight
than admit it.

648
00:33:07,348 --> 00:33:09,336
Yeah, like mother
like daughter.

649
00:33:09,428 --> 00:33:10,979
Dad.

650
00:33:11,071 --> 00:33:12,696
I see Mom called you.

651
00:33:14,241 --> 00:33:16,066
Thought you might be
missing this.

652
00:33:20,501 --> 00:33:23,126
I heard Penny was here
causing trouble.

653
00:33:23,218 --> 00:33:25,239
No problem at all.

654
00:33:25,331 --> 00:33:28,126
I don't think we have to worry
much about Penny anymore.

655
00:33:32,421 --> 00:33:33,836
Come here, kid.

656
00:33:35,211 --> 00:33:36,536
I'm gonna miss you.

657
00:33:40,261 --> 00:33:43,136
Go warm up the bikes,
will you, Jug?

658
00:33:45,731 --> 00:33:47,686
Thank you, Gladys,
for the call.

659
00:33:48,441 --> 00:33:50,046
I'll make sure
he gets home safe.

660
00:33:59,281 --> 00:34:00,736
Get out of here.

661
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:07,826
<i>Kevin, cadets!</i>

662
00:34:09,961 --> 00:34:11,699
This meal's on the house.

663
00:34:11,791 --> 00:34:13,436
But you brutes
are helping us out.

664
00:34:13,528 --> 00:34:15,516
We need backup
right the hell now.

665
00:34:15,608 --> 00:34:16,926
What's going on?

666
00:34:19,251 --> 00:34:20,886
On your feet, soldier boys!

667
00:34:21,381 --> 00:34:23,039
We're going to war.

668
00:34:23,131 --> 00:34:24,766
Paladins and Hellcasters,

669
00:34:25,721 --> 00:34:27,026
Healers and Deadeyes,

670
00:34:27,118 --> 00:34:30,036
your Game Master has
a new adventure for you.

671
00:34:30,128 --> 00:34:33,339
Your goal is to escape

672
00:34:33,431 --> 00:34:35,196
from the Gargoyle King's
fortress.

673
00:34:37,321 --> 00:34:40,256
But we can't. If he catches
us, we'll be punished.

674
00:34:40,348 --> 00:34:42,639
Yes. Severely.

675
00:34:42,731 --> 00:34:43,816
But there is hope.

676
00:34:43,908 --> 00:34:46,186
A Queen to lead you
into the light.

677
00:34:46,278 --> 00:34:48,286
Hark, there she be!

678
00:34:59,351 --> 00:35:03,589
Follow me,
your Gryphon Queen,

679
00:35:03,681 --> 00:35:07,206
away from this fortress, and back
to the kingdom of Eldervair!

680
00:35:07,298 --> 00:35:08,766
But what about the King?

681
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:15,936
The King is dead.

682
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,526
You're all free.

683
00:35:22,361 --> 00:35:24,506
We can't wake
the King's Demon Soldiers.

684
00:35:24,598 --> 00:35:26,106
I have the enchanted keys.

685
00:35:26,198 --> 00:35:28,746
Meet me at
the doors to freedom.

686
00:36:12,341 --> 00:36:14,609
Here you go.

687
00:36:14,701 --> 00:36:17,356
It's the last stop
before the border.

688
00:36:17,448 --> 00:36:18,859
Yeah.

689
00:36:18,951 --> 00:36:21,369
You know, I was thinking.
I could go with you.

690
00:36:21,461 --> 00:36:22,829
We could do this together.

691
00:36:22,921 --> 00:36:24,286
Find a cabin in the woods?

692
00:36:24,378 --> 00:36:27,236
Yeah. Teach you carpentry,
like my old man did me.

693
00:36:27,328 --> 00:36:28,636
Imagine that.

694
00:36:29,011 --> 00:36:30,769
Us.

695
00:36:30,861 --> 00:36:32,776
Living off the land,
father and son.

696
00:36:32,868 --> 00:36:34,799
Hunting, fishing.

697
00:36:34,891 --> 00:36:36,459
It would be great.

698
00:36:36,551 --> 00:36:38,066
Yeah, it would be.

699
00:36:39,941 --> 00:36:43,446
But, uh, you know
we can't do that.

700
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,236
Right, Dad?

701
00:36:47,401 --> 00:36:48,946
I can't change your mind,

702
00:36:49,451 --> 00:36:50,816
get you to come back home?

703
00:36:56,161 --> 00:36:57,916
But you can
give me your blessing.

704
00:37:01,961 --> 00:37:03,686
I was your age
when my father passed away.

705
00:37:03,778 --> 00:37:06,676
- I never got to say goodbye...
- This isn't goodbye, Dad.

706
00:37:08,971 --> 00:37:10,766
You're damn right, it's not.

707
00:37:15,481 --> 00:37:16,986
See you soon?

708
00:37:17,078 --> 00:37:18,936
Yeah, you will.

709
00:37:19,911 --> 00:37:22,106
Oh, one more thing.

710
00:37:28,821 --> 00:37:30,286
Vegas!

711
00:37:58,591 --> 00:38:01,066
- Mom, stop!
- You heard the woman! Halt!

712
00:38:03,661 --> 00:38:05,199
Veronica, what is this?

713
00:38:05,291 --> 00:38:06,386
Consider it a coup d'moi.

714
00:38:06,478 --> 00:38:08,099
We know your end game.

715
00:38:08,191 --> 00:38:10,529
You are hereby relieved
of your mayoral duties.

716
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,306
Those plans
you and your husband had

717
00:38:12,398 --> 00:38:13,726
with my dollymop mother

718
00:38:13,818 --> 00:38:15,979
are now canceled.

719
00:38:16,071 --> 00:38:18,379
Now, step away from the phone

720
00:38:18,471 --> 00:38:21,706
before you make the biggest
mistake of your life.

721
00:38:23,041 --> 00:38:24,466
Veronica...

722
00:38:25,551 --> 00:38:27,836
You can't just walk in here
and depose me.

723
00:38:28,291 --> 00:38:29,926
I'm an elected official.

724
00:38:32,301 --> 00:38:35,476
Besides, you're too late.

725
00:38:37,061 --> 00:38:39,339
The order went out
ten minutes ago.

726
00:38:39,431 --> 00:38:41,336
I was about
to call and tell you.

727
00:38:51,571 --> 00:38:52,896
It's starting.

728
00:38:58,321 --> 00:39:00,636
Betty, what are we going to do
with all these kids?

729
00:39:00,728 --> 00:39:02,159
They have nowhere to go.

730
00:39:02,251 --> 00:39:04,376
We'll help them, Ethel,
all of them.

731
00:39:07,501 --> 00:39:09,086
- Mom?
- Betty.

732
00:39:10,761 --> 00:39:13,079
Why are you wearing that outfit?
What's going on?

733
00:39:13,171 --> 00:39:15,456
- What are you doing here?
- Hell is breaking loose.

734
00:39:15,548 --> 00:39:17,866
I came to get you
out of the sisters'.

735
00:39:17,958 --> 00:39:21,936
Well, you're just in time,
but it's not just gonna be me.

736
00:39:26,061 --> 00:39:29,349
<i> And just like that,</i>
<i>in a few frantic moments,</i>

737
00:39:29,441 --> 00:39:30,956
<i>the town we'd known
all our lives</i>

738
00:39:31,048 --> 00:39:33,296
<i>was once again changed,</i>

739
00:39:33,388 --> 00:39:36,599
<i>but this time, irrevocably.</i>

740
00:39:36,691 --> 00:39:41,109
<i>It was time for us to brace
for a terrible impact.</i>

741
00:39:41,201 --> 00:39:44,896
<i>And while Archie Andrews headed away
from the doomed town of Riverdale,</i>

742
00:39:44,988 --> 00:39:47,039
<i>we raced towards it.</i>

743
00:39:47,131 --> 00:39:49,326
<i>For that night was
the fruition of a game</i>

744
00:39:49,418 --> 00:39:51,566
<i>that had been
planned for and played</i>

745
00:39:51,658 --> 00:39:53,716
<i>across the years.</i>

746
00:40:01,811 --> 00:40:02,949
The hell is this?

747
00:40:03,041 --> 00:40:04,866
Town's under quarantine.
Governor's orders.

748
00:40:04,958 --> 00:40:06,676
No one in or out.
Turn around and go.

749
00:40:06,768 --> 00:40:08,216
No. No, we live here.

750
00:40:08,308 --> 00:40:11,066
Not anymore. Turn around, now!

751
00:40:15,161 --> 00:40:17,596
<i> Well, Hiram,</i>
<i>you got what you wanted.</i>

752
00:40:17,688 --> 00:40:19,239
<i>The town's quarantined.</i>

753
00:40:19,331 --> 00:40:21,856
<i>I'll do what I can to keep
the outside world at bay.</i>

754
00:40:21,948 --> 00:40:24,169
Riverdale thanks you,
Governor Dooley.

755
00:40:24,261 --> 00:40:25,366
You did the right thing.

756
00:40:25,458 --> 00:40:27,199
<i>I pray that's true.</i>

757
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:29,796
<i>And may God have mercy
on our souls.</i>

758
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,876
Not God, Governor...

759
00:40:32,101 --> 00:40:33,261
The King.
