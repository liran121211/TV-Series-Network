00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:09,718
[narrator] <i>Previously on </i>Riverdale:

2
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:13,305
Dilton Doiley and Ben Button were found
in the woods with blue lips.

3
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:15,807
We made a pact
to never revisit that night.

4
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:19,061
- Gryphons and Gargoyles.
- Wonder if Ethel was playing with them.

5
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:22,606
If any of us talk to any grownups,
he's gonna get very, very angry,

6
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,066
Who? The Gargoyle King?

7
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:25,359
[snarling]

8
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:28,111
- She's having a seizure.
- Ethel. Help is coming, okay?

9
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:30,822
We both flipped the coin.
He was scared to ascend.

10
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:32,616
But I'm not. Soon you'll fly, too.

11
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,743
- [Jughead] Ben, no! Ben!
- [Betty] Ben!

12
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,537
I'm Evelyn. You're Betty Cooper?

13
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,747
Your mom and your sister
study with my dad.

14
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,582
- From the Farm?
- Yeah, that's right.

15
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:41,625
Edgar Evernever.

16
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,919
I won't tell anyone
about the other night.

17
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,420
Oh, my God. Betty.

18
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:46,797
Stop the riot.

19
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:48,840
[Norton] You impressed me today.

20
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:51,468
You've been tapped.
You're gonna be my new Mad Dog.

21
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:54,846
[door opens]

22
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:58,892
[footsteps approaching]

23
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,649
Well?

24
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:07,401
Had time to think?

25
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:08,986
The answer is still no.

26
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,196
Then I'll see you in another week.

27
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,541
This feels right, doesn't it?

28
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:29,006
I'm glad the Farm, uh, opened you up
to the possibility of us.

29
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:31,300
[chuckles]

30
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,432
What are you thinking about, Alice?

31
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:39,891
It's been three weeks.

32
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:44,187
No more suicides, no more blue lips.

33
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,857
As far as the town's concerned,

34
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,234
it was just two boys
taking their own lives

35
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:50,319
for whatever reason.

36
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:53,238
Hopefully it ends there.

37
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,534
With Jughead and Betty on the case?

38
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:00,704
You know that's not likely.

39
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,124
Betty, what are you thinking about?

40
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:06,835
Do you think it's sort of...

41
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:12,132
ghoulish for us to be crashing
Dilton's bunker like this?

42
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:15,886
This bunker is the only place in town
we can get a modicum of privacy.

43
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,264
- My dad's watching me like a hawk.
- Same with my mom.

44
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:27,022
Ben's death haunts me, Jug.

45
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,317
He didn't scream.

46
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,904
Why not, I wonder.

47
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:37,699
Because that's one of the rules
of Gryphons and Gargoyles?

48
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,244
Betty, that's what we're missing.

49
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,582
There's no rulebook, no player's manual.
What if that's the key to all this?

50
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,502
Ethel, Ben, and Dilton talk about it
like a religion.

51
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:49,961
Yeah, or a cult.

52
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,923
And every cult has its king.

53
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,219
Sorry I kept you waiting, Mr. Andrews.

54
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,179
How can I help you?

55
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,182
My son.

56
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:03,809
I wanna see him.

57
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:04,935
Today.

58
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,771
Your son is quite a firebrand.

59
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:09,898
He started a riot.

60
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,526
I'm afraid
his visitation privileges are suspended.

61
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,779
I was told by witnesses
that your guards started that riot.

62
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,448
That's a very serious accusation,
Mr. Andrews.

63
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:19,866
It's been three weeks.

64
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,829
I will decide when it is appropriate
for him to receive visitors again.

65
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,124
Was there anything else?

66
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,334
Yeah.

67
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,379
You'll be hearing from my lawyer.

68
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,465
[Veronica] <i>I'm in trouble here, Bee.</i>

69
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,176
I'm up to my eyebrows in bills.

70
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,886
Pop's is hemorrhaging money.

71
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,847
Well, how far along is the speakeasy?

72
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,056
Is it close, at least?

73
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:46,351
Vee, what?

74
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:47,519
What is it?

75
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:51,857
The speakeasy's ready.

76
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:55,986
- It has been for a while.
- What? Why haven't you opened it?

77
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,238
I've been waiting for Archie.

78
00:03:59,114 --> 00:03:59,948
I just...

79
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,203
I wanted him to be there,
dancing with me on opening night.

80
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:06,288
A part of it all.

81
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:12,210
This is exactly what Archie didn't want.

82
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,796
For you to just put your life on hold.

83
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,133
You need to focus on yourself
for a change.

84
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,761
I'm saying this to you as your friend.

85
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,596
Open the damn speakeasy.

86
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,268
Veronica says
she'll have a pretty strict dress code

87
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:31,271
- at her speakeasy.
- Of course we're calling it a speakeasy.

88
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:33,857
And, uh, what are you getting at?

89
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,487
Hey, Ethel's back.

90
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,656
Yeah, she's talking
to that weirdo girl from the Farm.

91
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:44,659
Oh, my God.

92
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:48,371
What if the game is
connected to the Farm?

93
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:52,542
Ben, Dilton, and Ethel
started playing the game this summer,

94
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:56,129
which is when the Farm
and the Evernevers moved to Riverdale.

95
00:04:56,213 --> 00:05:00,175
Evelyn's dad, Edgar, is their leader.
My mom won't stop talking about him.

96
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,718
- He's like a kind of...
- King?

97
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:07,307
- What do you know about him and the Farm?
- Basically nothing.

98
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,270
- Should we start with Evelyn or Ethel?
- Ethel.

99
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,565
Evelyn... creeps me out.

100
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:18,485
Last time we talked to Ethel,
she had a seizure.

101
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,279
We'll be more gentle this time.

102
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,114
[Josie] <i>Hi, Pop.</i>

103
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:25,325
Looking for Veronica? This way.

104
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,205
Pick up the phone, dial 642.

105
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,712
[phone line dialing]

106
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,506
- [Reggie] <i>Password.</i>
- I don't know.

107
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:40,882
Stonewall.

108
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,177
[Reggie] Close enough.

109
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,099
Whoa.

110
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:50,809
[Josie chuckles]

111
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,311
- Come on in.
- [Josie] Oh, my God.

112
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:58,692
Oh, my God.

113
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:01,319
I died and went to
Kander and Ebb heaven.

114
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,238
Veronica.

115
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,573
Welcome to La Bonne Nuit.

116
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,536
I hired some Serpents from the Whyte
Wyrm to serve drinks. Mocktails only.

117
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,414
La Bonne Nuit is not in the business
of corrupting minors.

118
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,748
Not yet.

119
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:15,542
Josie.

120
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,127
I need star power.

121
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,297
I would love for you
to be my resident chanteuse.

122
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,298
Are you for real?

123
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,215
Mm-hm.

124
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:25,802
I have been working like whoa
to find my sound now that I'm solo,

125
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,013
and I haven't had
anywhere to test it out.

126
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,725
Ooh, this is the perfect opportunity.

127
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,936
And, Kevin,
I'd love for you to be our emcee.

128
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,022
So long as I can sing now and then.

129
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:38,690
But of course.

130
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,693
Or as we like to say at La Bonne Nuit,
<i>mais oui.</i>

131
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:43,612
[phone rings]

132
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,448
Hey, Pop. What's up?

133
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:51,953
[Veronica] <i>Penny Peabody.</i>

134
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,916
I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
Now, what the hell do you want?

135
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,210
[chuckles] No, no, no.
It's not what I want.

136
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,671
It's what you want.

137
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:02,923
Protection.

138
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,884
The Ghoulies are offering
their services...

139
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:07,719
for a modest price.

140
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:09,888
Let me guess.

141
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,932
Protection from you, right?

142
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,768
[Penny] It's a nice place you got here.

143
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:19,397
And... as above, so below, I'm guessing.

144
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,317
Maybe even nicer down there
in the speakeasy?

145
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,277
I'd hate for something bad
to happen to it.

146
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,279
Food for thought.

147
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,327
I'll let you chew on it.

148
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,840
Up and at 'em. We're going for a ride.

149
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,097
[boys grunting]

150
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,018
Welcome to the Pit.

151
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:05,986
Joaquin.

152
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,613
When you refused my offer,
I tapped a replacement.

153
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:10,949
I knew you were friends
with Mr. DeSantos.

154
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:14,995
As you can see, he's nearly reached
the end of his... usefulness.

155
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,373
Only you, Mr. Andrews,
can decide how he ends it.

156
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,375
Back in his cell, safe and sound.

157
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,752
Or in the infirmary on life support.

158
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,929
I'll do it. I'll take his place.

159
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,348
[crowd cheering]

160
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,027
[security alarm buzzes]

161
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,615
Andrews, meet the rest of the team.

162
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,082
The name's Baby Teeth.

163
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,585
May not look like much,
but I leave a mark.

164
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:05,545
That's Thumper,

165
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:06,463
and Peter.

166
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,339
Archie.

167
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,927
You better start hitting this bag,
before the captain comes over.

168
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:18,892
Rules of the fight:

169
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,393
Bare knuckles till knockout.

170
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:22,103
Warden sells the tickets.

171
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:23,313
Guards place bets.

172
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,606
Everyone profits.

173
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,149
Except us.

174
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,151
Get perks if we win.

175
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:31,988
What happened to Mad Dog?

176
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:34,783
Quit the chatter.

177
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,328
Best you don't ask many questions.

179
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,046

about my speakeasy.

181

- Go on.
- In exchange for promoting La Bonne Nuit,

182
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:57,430
I'm offering you no cover
and free drinks all night. Mm-hm.

183
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:01,059
[Cheryl] Well, well, well.

184
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:04,187
Heavy card stock, and valet parking.

185
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,147
You don't take the
subway to the Met Gala.

186
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:07,899
Hand them out at your discretion.

187
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,777
And Sweet Pea and Fangs
should be in attendance.

188
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,156
Hmm.

189
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,164
Ethel.

190
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:24,666
Hi.

191
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:27,919
Are you eating alone?

192
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:29,921
Do you mind if we...?

193
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,673
The doctors put me on medication.

194
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,383
To stop the seizures.

195
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,387
I was having them multiple times a day.

196
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:38,888
It's very strong.

197
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:42,892
Look, if Betty and I did something
to trigger your seizures, we're sorry.

198
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:44,435
We were trying to help.

199
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:48,022
Like you tried to help my boyfriend,
Ben, when he threw himself out a window?

200
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,483
Ethel...

201
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:55,363
when you collapsed,
did you have any visions?

202
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,616
I honestly don't remember.

203
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,160
Okay.

204
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,998
Well, how long have you been friends
with Evelyn Evernever?

205
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:06,833
Evelyn's the best.

206
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,752
She visited me in the hospital,
is helping me get better,

207
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,839
- so I can titrate down my meds.
- Was that her idea or her dad's?

208
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,592
Wait, have you met Mr. Evernever?

209
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,636
If you're so curious,
check out Evelyn's peer support group.

210
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:20,763
Weatherbee gave her permission

211
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,016
to start a student chapter
of the Farm here.

212
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:26,603

Uh...

He mentioned reuniting with Dilton
in the Kingdom.

217
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:41,868
You know what that means?

218
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,954
Two people died,
playing Gryphons and Gargoyles.

219

G&G.

220
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,249
We have no idea why.
This is a crazy question.

221
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,877
Do you have a rulebook
or a player's manual?

222
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,296
You mean the scripture?

223
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,714
Yes. That.

224
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,049
Do you own a copy?

225
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,343
I can't just tell you that, obviously.

226
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,929
Please? Princess Etheline.

227
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:04,015
Don't call me that.
You haven't earned that privilege.

228
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,725
You're not worthy of
the King's scripture.

229
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,018
Yes, but I wanna be.

230
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:10,563
I wanna be worthy.
Could you please show me how?

231
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,779
Meet me tomorrow night
at Dilton's bunker.

232
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,657
But... just you.

233
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:25,495
Sorry, Betty, but you'll never be
worthy, no matter how hard you try.

234
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:37,090
Well...
looks like you're on Ethel Muggs detail.

235
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,175
And I...

236
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:43,221
am in need of some serious peer support.

237
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,686
These were upstairs for you.

00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:53,356
Hopefully it's the last
of the deliveries.

Sheriff Minetta's upstairs?

247

We have been set up.

248
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,808
I can't get caught with this.

wanna show me around?

Of course not, Reggie.

Well, I came to learn
more about the Farm.

Am I early?

No. No, the Farm just needs some time
to catch on.

- Yeah.
- But it will.

Sweet Pea and Fangs were right.

Yeah.
The jingle-jangle business is booming.

355
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:41,430
Should be plenty of admissible evidence
for blackmail, Veronica.

Ethel.

359
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,368
Welcome to your first game.

360
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,287
Your entry point to the realm
of Gryphons and Gargoyles.

361
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:06,789
The magical kingdom of Eldervair.

362
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:16,590
First things first.

363
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:21,137
Do you wanna be the Radiant Knight,
Arcane Invoker, or Hellcaster?

364
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:22,722
Uh, Hellcaster.

365
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:28,352
Good choice. That was Ben's avatar.

366
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,896
I was supposed to ascend with him,

367
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,607
but he betrayed me
and finished the game with Dilton.

368
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,026
Leaving you high and dry.

369
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,070
Doesn't matter.

370
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:40,990

Betty, please, join us.

374
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,794
Sit.

375
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,797
Evelyn told us you're ready
to meet the Farm.

376
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,803
I thought
Mr. Evernever would be joining us.

377

378
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:06,724
No. You don't just meet Edgar.

379
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:11,103
There are certain levels that you need
to attain before meeting Edgar.

380
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:13,564
First you start by
meeting a few Farmies.

381
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:15,441
Today can be your first testimony.

382
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,026
Testimony?

383
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,819
It's just a conversation.

384
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:22,448
An open, nonjudgmental conversation

385
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,992
about all the bad things you've done
in your life.

386
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,120
What kind of stuff would
you like to know?

387
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:29,038
Everything.

388
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,081
Speak from your heart.

389
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:35,711
From what your mother and Polly told us,
we know you've been through so much.

390
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:39,882
Between your dark kinship with your
father and the role you played

391
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:43,344
in disposing of the dead body
in your kitchen.

392
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:44,970
Wait. What? What?

393
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:47,807
Mom. Wait, you...? You told the Farm

394
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,601
about Chic and the shady man?
Are you out of your mind?

395
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,854
Oh, everything that we talk about
at the Farm

396
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:56,148
is kept in confidence.

397
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:58,526
We know all each other's secrets.

398
00:21:58,651 --> 00:21:59,485
The wig.

399
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:01,612
The webcamming.

400
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:05,741
Okay. Okay.

401
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,369
If tonight's all about
open conversation,

402
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:11,705
then let's talk about how you,
Evelyn, were there

403
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:14,208
at both my seizure and Ethel's.

404
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,710
And about how the Farm showed up
in Riverdale

405
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:19,296
at about the same time as a crazy game.

406
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,508
- Elizabeth, what are you talking about?
- It's a game.

407
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:26,971
It's called Gryphons and Gargoyles, that
made Ben and Dilton kill themselves,

408
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,057
all to appease some creature
called the Gargoyle King,

409
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,226
who, for all we know,
is Edgar Evernever.

410
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:36,063
The first time any of us heard
of Gryphons and Gargoyles

411
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:38,399
was from your mother, Betty.

412
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,359
How does that make any sense?

413
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,736
Mom, how do you know
about Gryphons and Gargoyles?

414
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,989
Betty. We're here to talk about you,

415
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:46,699
not your mother's past.

416
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,409
My mother's past?

417
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,244
You know, Evelyn, you were right.

418
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:52,621
It's too soon. Betty's not ready.

419
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:54,999
Mom.

420
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,125
You...

421
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,169
- You...
- Betty.

422
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:00,212
No. Don't touch me.

423
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:02,131
I'm fine.

424
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:09,013
Okay. You've crossed the old footbridge
to find two doors.

425
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,098
One is made of shimmering gold.

426
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:14,935
The other is just plain old maple wood.
Which door do you pick?

427
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:18,689
- Let's go with Door Number Two.
- Well-picked, Caster.

428
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:20,524
You've entered a secret chamber.

429
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:23,569
You're in the middle of a circle,
composed of gryphon bones.

430
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,365
Two chalices sit before you.

431
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:31,619
Ethel.

432
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,163
No. No way.

433
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,081
You wanted to prove your worthiness.

434
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:38,709
You have to drink
from one of the sacred goblets.

435
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,921
Like Ben and Dilton? You're asking
me to play Russian roulette.

436
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:43,631
To play Gryphons and Gargoyles.

437
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:47,885
- Is there poison in these Fresh-Aids?
- That's gargoyle blood, as you well know.

438
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,142
Flip for your fate.

439
00:23:58,854 --> 00:23:59,688
If I do this...

440
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:05,945
- you promise to give me the scripture?
- I promise.

441
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,738
The King as my witness.

442
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:19,541
Gryphon.

443
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,054
Salut.

444
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:41,563
How do you feel?

445
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:51,198
Okay... I think.

446
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:55,995
Hey, rulebook. Come on.

447
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:05,921
You have to kiss me first.

448
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,424
My God, Ethel. Are you serious?

449
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,633
It's in the scripture.

450
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:12,845
The Hellcaster kisses the princess
or doesn't get the treasure.

451
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,055
Fine.

452
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:23,522
- Is this the only one?
- That I'm aware of.

453
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:28,986
All right. It's all in here.

454
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,196
The characters...

455
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,909
[scoffs] Oh, Betty's gonna
lose her mind over this.

456
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:38,996
What are you doing? Put that down.

457
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,707
- You okay?
- Jughead.

458
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,543
Come on. Come on. I'm
gonna call you 911.

459
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,961
Jeez, come on. Come on.

460
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:56,805
[Ethel] Jughead?

461
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:00,809
- What happened?
- You're in the hospital.

462
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:04,730
You ingested poison,
but they got you the antidote in time,

463
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,065
so, you're gonna be okay.

464
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,194
Protocol for anyone on suicide watch.

465
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,278
Suicide watch?

466
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,281
- But I didn't try to...
- You did.

467
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,328
When your parents get here,
be honest with them.

468
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:22,372
- You have to tell them about this game.
- I can't.

469
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,085
I'll never tell them.

470
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,087
Neither will you. If you do,

471
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,922
- I'll say you mixed the Fresh-Aid.
- It's over.

472
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:31,507
This game.

473
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,258
Whatever game you were playing...

474
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:34,927
is over now, Ethel.

475
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:36,011
No.

476
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,013
It's only just beginning.

477
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,725
You've proven yourself, Hellcaster.

478
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:44,561
I told him.
I told him that you were worthy enough

479
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:46,063
- to spread his gospel.
- Who?

480
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,731
Don't be dumb.

481
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:49,566
The King, of course.

482
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:53,112
The King isn't going to
hurt anyone anymore.

483
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,490
I'll make sure this doesn't
end up in anyone else's hands.

484
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:57,407
Okay?

485
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,121
Thank you, Hellcaster,

486
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,039
for helping me finish my game.

487
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:13,882
All right, Daddy. Cards on the table. I'm
not paying protection money to anyone.

488
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,717
Not Penny, not Minetta,

489
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:17,845
- and especially not to you.
- Veronica.

490
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:21,765
A bit of advice,
from one entrepreneur to another:

491
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:25,102
Don't make enemies
of people trying to help you.

492
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:26,770
Help me?

493
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:28,647
Okay.

494
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,149
Here's the deal.

495
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:32,693
You tell your lackeys to back off,

496
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:36,071
or I'll send these photographs
of your drug lab to the authorities

497
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:38,031
faster than you can say Heisenberg.

498
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:41,451
Hmm.

499
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:45,080
I doubt these will have much traction
with Minetta.

500
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:46,999
[chuckles] I won't go to Minetta.

501
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,375
I'll go to the FBI.

502
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:52,713
Oh, and also,
I want $10,000 a week in perpetuity.

503
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:56,216
That's right, Daddy.
I'm shaking you down.

504
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:59,845
You can keep those, by the way.
I have copies.

505
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:06,518
The governor's hosting a fundraiser
in Seaside.

506
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:09,813
But I'll be back for your next match.

507
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:14,151
Which is what I want
to talk to you about.

508
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:22,159
Ending a fight in a single punch
is not entertaining enough.

509
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:25,162
Tonight,
your opponent should be no trouble.

510
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:26,371
Punish him.

511
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,831
Give us a show.

512
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:29,625
And savor it.

513
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:34,296
Make it last,
oh, five or six rounds, at least.

514
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,341
That should fully sate
the crowd's bloodlust.

515
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:38,884
And mine.

516
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:42,679
Understood?

517
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:45,974
Yes, sir.

518
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:57,027
I thought being here...

519
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,446
I'd pay for everything that I did.

520
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:03,617
But what the warden wants me to do,
to become...

521
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:07,037
is so much worse.

522
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:12,125
When you were little,
I used to get calls from your school.

523
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:16,421
Telling me that you had been in a fight,
usually protecting someone.

524
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:19,049
The warden wants six rounds, Dad.

525
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,718
He wants blood.
There's nothing that I can do.

526
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:25,138
Your seventh-grade teacher told me

What do you mean?

702
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:40,980
Flipping through that manual felt
like... Like I was reading evil.

703
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,278
They played the game, Jug.

704
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:49,197
My mom, your dad.

705
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:53,660
That's why they were so down on us
investigating Ben and Dilton,

706
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:56,621
and why they freaked out
over us having the manual.

707
00:40:57,747 --> 00:41:01,167
Well, if what Ethel said about
that being the only rulebook is true,

708
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:04,253
no one's gonna play
that game ever again.

709
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:07,840
It's over.

710
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,224
I did what you asked.

711
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:17,892
I spread your gospel.

712
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:21,479
[Jughead] <i>Ethel must've done it</i>
<i>before our rendezvous in the bunker.</i>

713
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,773
<i>Or maybe there was someone else
helping her.</i>

714
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:31,239
- Um, excuse you?
- Where'd you get this?

715
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,825
It was in my locker.
Same with everyone else.

716
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:39,956
[Jughead] <i>Either way, by next weekend,</i>

717
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:43,710
<i>almost every student at Riverdale High
would play Gryphons and Gargoyles.</i>

718
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:48,047
<i>And the real game was just beginning.</i>

719
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:49,507
Soon they'll join us.

720
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:51,968
All of them, my King.

721
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:55,888
