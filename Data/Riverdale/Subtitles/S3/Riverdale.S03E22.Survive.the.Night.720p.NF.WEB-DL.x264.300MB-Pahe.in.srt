1
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:12,220
-[Betty] <i>Previously on </i>Riverdale:
-Hiram Lodge, you're under arrest.

2
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:14,723
My own daughter, working with the feds.

3
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:16,016
Is there someone else here?

4
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:18,852
I came to tell her
that I wanted to be with her.

5
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:21,938
[Betty] Gryphons and Gargoyles is
literally killing people.

6
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:26,276
-There was something lodged in his throat.
-A matchbook from the Maple Club.

7
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,779
According to Ethel,
Jason Blossom is the Gargoyle King.

8
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,823
[Jughead]
The return of the Black Hood, now we have

9
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:34,868
-two serial killers running around.
-[Betty] Possibly working together.

10
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:37,203
Let the Farm protect you. Both of you.

11
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:39,330
The Farm gave me back my brother.

12
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:44,169
Yes, I see my son Charles.
It's like I never lost him.

13
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:47,881
There's a refrigerator filled to the brim
with human organs.

14
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,592
Prepare Betty for her procedure.

15
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:52,218
Get your hands off my girlfriend!

16
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,971
Toni, this is your only chance at freedom.

17
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,931
Go! Run! Go!

18
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,393
[Penelope] There, there, Antoinette.

19
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:03,521
Now that you've settled down
with a cup of calming tea,

20
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,774
why don't you
explain this to me one more time.

21
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:09,152
Mrs. Blossom, Cheryl is in danger.

22
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:13,114
She's at the Farm with Betty,
Kevin and Fangs,

23
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,991
and Edgar Evernever.

24
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:19,412
And he's harvesting organs
from his followers.

25
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:20,705
Oh, dear.

26
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,540
Is that what he's doing there?

27
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,418
Well, it's fortunate I was here

28
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:28,088
collecting my mail at Thistlehouse
when you arrived.

29
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,423
And Betty's with them, you say?

30
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,176
Yeah, and, um, we need to go save them

31
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,803
because we...

32
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,811
Good night, my dear.

33
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,772
Thank you for the information.

34
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:48,191
Very timely, indeed.

35
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:50,902
[Jughead]
<i>I refuse to accept what Ethel said,</i>

36
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:53,321
that Jason Blossom is the Gargoyle King.

37
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:56,741
Even though his coffin was empty.
It defies logic.

38
00:01:56,825 --> 00:02:00,912
Well, say Ethel is off her rocker, okay,
but where's Jason's body?

39
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:05,333
And someone's still wearing
the Gargoyle King's antlers, so...

40
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:09,170
it's up to you and me to figure out who,
Blossom or no Blossom.

41
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:12,841
I keep thinking about that matchbook
Dr. Curdle found in Baby Teeth's throat.

42
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,635
Kurtz must have got that
at the Maple Club, right?

43
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:17,178
What are you getting at, boy?

44
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,389
Do you have a copy of Kurtz's mug shot
I can borrow?

45
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:30,942
Dad.

46
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,653
Sorry to interrupt,

47
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:36,072
but you have a visitor,
she says it can't wait.

48
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:39,576
[Edgar] <i>Mrs. Blossom,</i>
<i>what can I do for you?</i>

49
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,787
Let's not mince words, Mr. Evernever.

50
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:46,916
I am fully aware of the foul activities
you're conducting here.

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,793
The Topaz girl told me.

52
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:53,464
I have no interest in
exposing your shenanigans.

53
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,091
Then why have you come?

54
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,718
You have something that I want.

55
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,930
-Ms. Blossom--
-You sell organs, don't you?

56
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,808
I'm looking to buy in bulk.

57
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,191
Did you ever see a client in here
by the name of Kurtz at the Maple Club?

58
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:12,734
He looked like this.

59
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:14,569
Yes.

60
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,655
-I never worked with him directly.
-Who did he work with?

61
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:20,158
All of his interactions were with...

62
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,076
The Red Dahlia? Penelope Blossom?

63
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,369
Yeah.

64
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:25,997
Out of curiosity,

65
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,626
you never saw Penelope with a young man,
a young redhead, did you?

66
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,170
You mean her kid, Jason?

67
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,006
Yeah, sure, he came around.

68
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:41,596
We've been compromised, Evelyn.
We've had too many breaches.

69
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,389
-It's time--
-[Alice] Edgar.

70
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,267
What's happening?
Why is everyone acting so skittish?

71
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:50,146
The outside world is encroaching
upon us, Sister Alice.

72
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,983
We've had both defectors
and unwelcomed visitors.

73
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,612
The Ascension is upon us. Tonight.

74
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:58,905
The Ascension?

75
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,699
-Tonight?
-[Edgar] Yes.

76
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,035
Preparations are being made.

77
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:08,248
-I need to find Betty. Have you seen her?
-She escaped. With Toni Topaz.

78
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:14,087
-Escaped?
-She was never a believer like you, Alice.

79
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,631
So, we will ascend without her.

80
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,937
In the wake of Mr. Lodge's arrest,

81
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,690
you now have full ownership
of the Pembrooke

82
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,067
and all other Lodge investment properties.

83
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:40,822
And, Veronica, you and your mother are now
the co-owners of Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe

84
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,740
and the speakeasy beneath it.

85
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:48,621
Now, there's one more property
I'm curious about...

86
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:53,084
Mom, that was Veronica on the phone
with some amazing news.

87
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,128
She says she's giving me the El Royale.

88
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,547
That I legit own the gym now,
free and clear.

89
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,757
That's a very generous gift, Archie.

90
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:04,637
But still, I'm interested
in where you two stand romantically.

91
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:06,639
[knocking on door]

92
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,018
We expecting anyone?

93
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,447
[Archie] <i>Someone left mine at the door.</i>

94
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,241
Mine, too.
My dad or Jellybean could've found it.

95
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,785
Mine was waiting for me downstairs,
at the speakeasy.

96
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,620
Are we sure they're not fakes?

97
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:30,788
I don't think so.

98
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:33,875
And I've been trying Betty at the Farm,
but she's not answering.

99
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:37,086
The invitations say not to tell anyone
and not to bring our phones.

100
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,463
So, it's a trap.

101
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:43,593
Was that ever a doubt?
We don't really have a choice.

102
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:19,837
Guys.

103
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,092
Elizabeth. Pretty.

104
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:28,471
Good evening.
Come and join us, why don't you?

105
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:30,640
Penelope.

106
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,727
What-- What is this place?

107
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:39,982
This is the Blossom hunting lodge,
on the grounds of Thornhill.

108
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:41,943
How did I get here?

109
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:44,529
I bought you from Mr. Evernever.

110
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:47,907
Just as he was about to cut you
into butcher's parts.

111
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:52,745
Now, Agatha here will show you
to your place.

112
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,330
Sister Woodhouse?

113
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,375
You naughty, naughty girl.

114
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:00,169
Agatha was one of my mentors.

115
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,714
She cared for me when I was an orphan
at the Sisters of Quiet Mercy.

116
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,759
Taught me everything I know about poisons.

117
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,596
The murdered nuns...

118
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,391
You did that?

119
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,270
Oh. Loose ends,
such a bother, aren't they?

120
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:20,148
Loose ends? Is that what we are?

121
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,778
Oh, gosh, no, not you.
You are featured players.

122
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:29,240
The sons and daughters
of the original Midnight Club.

123
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,242
Jug, what's happening?

124
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:33,536
-I've almost figured it out...
-Oh, have you?

125
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,747
Because if anybody could,
it would be you, Mr. Jones.

126
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,584
But first, two more guests.

127
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,002
[bell ringing]

128
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,337
I believe you know them already.

129
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,136
[chuckles]

130
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:57,435
What have I told you?
No masks at the dinner table.

131
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:58,352
Take them off.

132
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:02,857
Oh, my God.

133
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,488
Wait, King, before you do...

134
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:12,658
Hellcaster, care to take a stab?

135
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:15,620
Sure.

136
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,415
Arthur Conan Doyle famously said,

137
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,293
"Once you eliminate the impossible,
whatever remains,

138
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:24,754
however improbable, must be the truth."

139
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,256
In which case...

140
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:30,927
whoever is underneath that mask
must have had a connection to Hal,

141
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,512
and to you, Penelope.

142
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,597
But it's not Jason, because he's dead,

143
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,683
even though his corpse is missing.

144
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,561
The one corpse
that hasn't been accounted for,

145
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,481
and who was last seen by the Black Hood...

146
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,691
-Chic.
-Chic.

147
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,573
What the hell?

148
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,534
Since when does Chic have red hair?

149
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,370
I'm guessing
since he started working with Penelope,

150
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,038
doing her bidding.

151
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,917
But this was after he got
the Gargoyle symbols tattooed on his back.

152
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:06,254
That's why Ethel said the Gargoyle King
was Jason.

153
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:10,633
Because you called him Jason.
Because you dressed him up like Jason.

154
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,677
You didn't murder Chic.

155
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,055
After you chased him
through the woods, you...

156
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,933
I recognized a kinship in him
and I spared him.

157
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,476
He begged for mercy

158
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,938
and pledged his life to me
in service of my mission.

159
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,857
But it wasn't just your mission,
was it, Mr. Cooper?

160
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,861
Maybe not at first, but eventually,
you started working with someone else

161
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,072
who also had a grudge against Riverdale.

162
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:37,285
In the middle of all that stuff
with the Black Hood last year, my dad...

163
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,830
was having an affair with Penelope.

164
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:46,752
Yes, I did cultivate your father's...
murderous impulses.

165
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,129
It's true.

166
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:50,590
To take my revenge on a town

167
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:54,468
that allowed me to be sold
as a child bride to the Blossoms.

168
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:57,096
Your parents knew. I told them.

169
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,640
And they did nothing but mock me.

170
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:03,102
And years later, when my Jason
was murdered in cold blood,

171
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,316
do you think one of them
reached out to me?

172
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:13,654
No, they were too busy
ignoring the rotting, fetid truth.

173
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:18,451
That Riverdale is a hideous
and cruel place, twisted and cursed.

174
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,832
And the Black Hood and I,
we were doing quite well.

175
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,421
Exterminating its sinners.

176
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,048
Until my dad got arrested.

177
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:35,426
Yes. But that was fine
because Hal's disciple came to me.

178
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:39,889
Lost, and I gave him purpose.
To continue our great work.

179
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,390
[Jughead] But not as the Black Hood.

180
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,477
So, instead, you made him dress up
like the boogeyman...

181
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:46,854
the Gargoyle King.

182
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:50,191
You introduced G&G to our parents
25 years ago.

183
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,737
And then re-introduced it this year
to Chic...

184
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,198
His name is Jason.

185
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:58,115
Who gave it to...

186
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:00,826
Ben Button.

187
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,204
Who started playing with Dilton Doiley...

188
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:05,456
[Betty] A<i>nd Ethel Muggs.</i>

189
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:11,504
<i>And then G&G spread like a virus</i>

190
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:12,588
or a poison...

191
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:16,676
And the true mastermind behind it all,
the true King,

192
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,927
is you, Penelope.

193
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:18,886
Oh.

194
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:20,763
Well done.

195
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,182
Well done.

196
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:29,772
But now,
it's time to play one final round,

197
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,441
with you, the Midnight Children.

198
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,901
To what end?

199
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,362
Say it's to reveal your true nature.

200
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:41,784
To prove that you are as dark-hearted
as the town that birthed you.

201
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,411
And what?

202
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:46,080
-If we win, we escape?
-You won't win.

203
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,331
So, what happens if we lose?

204
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:51,335
Well, then your parents will feel the pain
that I felt.

205
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:56,257
The death of a child,
could there be anything more dreadful?

206
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,591
You're nuts.

207
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,177
[bell tolling]

208
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:01,637
Ah.

209
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,013
It is time.

210
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,351
Come to the lawn for the Gathering.

211
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:16,235
The task before you is simple.

212
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:20,156
Make it through the woods.
Survive the night.

213
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:26,078
You will be tested, each of you.
Refuse my tests, or try to escape,

214
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,874
and my Gargoyle minion will kill you.

215
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:34,253
May the final quest begin.

216
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,216
I'd start running if I were you.

217
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,733
The good news is,
if Penelope wanted us dead, we would be.

218
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:56,776
She wants us alive.

219
00:12:56,859 --> 00:13:00,946
Yeah, well, at least long enough
to complete her bizarre social experiment.

220
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,198
Yeah, or die trying.

221
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,908
We don't even know where to go.

222
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:07,745
Actually, Enchantress, we might.

223
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,331
Come on, let's go.

224
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:15,419
Kevin. Fangs.
Save those eyes for the bedroom, boys.

225
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,254
We're getting out
of this House of the Devil.

226
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:21,133
Cheryl? Aren't you confined to your room
for helping Toni escape?

227
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,886
Yeah, and suddenly you're sounding
a lot like Betty.

228
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:27,723
Betty knew the score.
Edgar Evernever is harvesting organs.

229
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,770
Come with me.

230
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:35,981
Betty told me exactly where Edgar keeps
his innards collection.

231
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,406
Are you still seeing organs, Cheryl?

232
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,118
What? Edgar must have moved them,
or Evelyn did.

233
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:51,664
Cheryl, we are getting ready to ascend.
And you should, too.

234
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,084
What if I get my hands
on irrefutable proof

235
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,378
that Edgar Evernever is
a modern-day Dr. Frankenstein?

236
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,463
You know what? Sure.

237
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,466
Then proof, Kevin, is what you shall have.

238
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,354
Where the hell are they?

239
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,659
Who's there?

240
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:30,953
Reveal thyself.

241
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,084
I'm in no mood. I said, who are...?

242
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,046
Oh, my...

243
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,340
[screaming]

244
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,891
[Jughead] It's a Red Paladin card.

245
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,603
Archie, this quest is for you.

246
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,778
"The Red Paladin must conquer
the Grizzled Beast.

247
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:08,657
He must battle alone in the pit
to save his home."

248
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,577
What is a grizzled beast?

249
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,162
[growling nearby]

250
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:15,748
Oh, crap.

251
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,042
Not again.

252
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,391
Archie, don't do this.

253
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,727
That guy is eight-feet-tall and jacked.

254
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,438
It's just a fight,
I've been fighting all year.

255
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:43,025
Don't forget, I survived
a real bear attack, remember?

256
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:48,113
If I don't make it, tell my mom and dad
I love them, and you guys.

257
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,288
[grunting and shouting]

258
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,584
Hey.

259
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,588
Come here.

260
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,390
Archie, are you sure you're okay?

261
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,518
Apart from every inch of my body...

262
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:45,647
-What do we do now?
-We gotta keep moving.

263
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,858
Penelope has already left us more clues.

264
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:50,652
Come on.

265
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,907
[Edgar] What troubles you, Sister Alice?

266
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,951
I can't get in touch with Betty, and...

267
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,412
I'm hearing rumors.

268
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,539
Whisperings.

269
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,665
About harvesting?

270
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:05,626
I see.

271
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,046
May I address your concerns?

272
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,677
Unfortunately,

273
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,347
there's not much I can say

274
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,682
about Betty or where she is.

275
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,894
About the rumors,

276
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:26,855
I admit,

277
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:30,484
I have not been entirely truthful

278
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:32,986
about all the activities of the Farm.

279
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,697
What kind of sick monster are you?

280
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,659
Cheryl, I'm in a meeting,
please respect Sister Alice.

281
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:42,871
Why? Why would you do such a thing?
To my own brother?

282
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:47,126
You had a void.

283
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:51,713
It is my job to diagnose how to fill it.

284
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,049
-By grave-robbing?
-Wait, what?

285
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:54,967
Grab her.

286
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,636
No! Get your hands off me!

287
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,680
Confine Miss Blossom to her room.

288
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:02,224
You won't get away with this!
Toni will come for me!

289
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,809
Kevin's father is a law man!

290

He won't abide his son living
in the tenth circle of hell!

291
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:14,278
Evelyn. Sister Alice. Will you help me
gather our flock in the Chamber?

292
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:18,240
So that we may ascend with all haste.

and drinking from the chosen chalice.

I have faith.

What's the alternative?
We get shot in the woods by snipers?

Remarkable, Enchantress.

Of course. It was a character challenge.

325

The Game was testing
if you had honor and loyalty.

-None of the chalices were poisoned.
-On the contrary,

327

all of the chalices were poisoned.

328
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,213
It's slow-acting,

329
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:04,383
but the only way to obtain the antidote is
to finish the game.

330
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,802

I'm Agent Smith with the FBI.
Is Betty Cooper here by any chance?

527
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:44,011
-[Betty] Is this about the Lodges?
-No.

528
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,013
It's about your mother.

529
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:50,977
My team has been investigating
Edgar Evernever for quite some time now.

530
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,520
We almost had him two towns ago.

531
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,146
What were you waiting for?

532
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:57,858
He and his kooks took over
the Sisters of Quiet Mercy months ago.

533
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,277
We had someone on the inside.

534
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,487
Someone tasked
with getting close to Edgar.

535
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:04,240
Gathering intel.
We were waiting on her word.

536
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,743
Her? You mean...

537
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,454
Your mother. She's working with us.

538
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:17,420
My mother-- My mother is an FBI informant?

539
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:20,589
She's been helping us build a case
against Edgar Evernever and his Farmies,

540
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,049
their organ harvesting, all of it.

541
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,343
You knew about the organ harvesting?

542
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,679
It's vital that we find your mom, ASAP.

543
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:29,473
Which is why my team and I will be
setting up shop here in Riverdale

544
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:32,059
until we can safely locate
and extract her.

545
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,937
I mean, what--?
Is there anything we can do to help?

546
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,230
I thought you might ask.

547
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:39,483
You two are quite the detectives
around these parts.

548
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:46,282
I'm sorry, this is gonna seem weird,
but do I know you?

549
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:52,246
As a matter of fact, yes.

550
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:55,916
It's no coincidence that your mother and I
found each other.

551
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:57,793
You see, I'm...

552
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:01,547
I'm Charles.

553
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,174
Your brother.

554
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:06,927
[chuckles]

555
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:10,806
You...

556
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,350
You can't be.

557
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:14,685
Wait.

558
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,521
If you're Charles...

559
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:21,817
You and I are also brothers,
Jughead, that's right.

560
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:28,199
[Archie] Back up, your brother's alive?
And he's an FBI agent?

561
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:31,744
It's our half-brother.
It's pretty crazy, right?

562
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:34,872
Oh, and my mom is also working
for the FBI,

563
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,457
undercover at the Farm.

564
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,375
What?

565
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:41,420
Actually, that kind of tracks.

566
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,714
What about you, Vee?
Any word about your mom?

567
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:46,258
She's trying to cut a deal with the DA,

568
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:49,720
but in the meantime,
Smithers is my legal guardian.

569
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:52,515
Guys, let's make a vow.

570
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,101
Another one.

571
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:58,062
We've got senior year ahead of us.
Let's enjoy it.

572
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:00,272
Let's vow to be done with death cults,

573
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:01,899
and murder mysteries,

574
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:03,609
and gremlins...

575
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:04,527
[chuckles]

576
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:06,237
It's gargoyles.

577
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:10,408
Our senior year could be the last time
we're all together in the same place.

578
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,868
I don't wanna let anything ruin that.

579
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:18,165
Agreed.

580
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,126
I'm in.

581
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:21,460
I'm so in.

582
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:22,711
Me, too.

583
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:27,716
Well, it sounds a little dull, but sure.
Let's toast.

584
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:30,052
[Archie] To the future.

585
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:39,478
[Betty] Archie?

586
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:42,273
Archie?

587
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:44,400
Archie!

588
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,571
-Are you listening to me?
-Yeah.

589
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,199
We have to burn all of our clothes.

590
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,909
Including Jughead's beanie.

591
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,912
We'll wash off the blood
in the swimming hole.

592
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:02,460
After tonight,
we never speak of this. Ever.

593
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:04,962
Not to each other, not to our parents.

594
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,131
No one.

595
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:11,510
We finish our senior year, we graduate,
and we'll go our separate ways.

596
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:14,138
That is the only way
that we won't get caught.

597
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:20,936
Do it.

598
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,788
Friends forever.

599
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:42,374
[all] Friends forever.

600
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,876
