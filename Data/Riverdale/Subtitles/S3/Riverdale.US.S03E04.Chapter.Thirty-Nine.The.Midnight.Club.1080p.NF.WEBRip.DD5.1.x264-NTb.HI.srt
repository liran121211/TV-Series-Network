00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:09,634
[narrator] <i>Previously on </i>Riverdale:

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,555
The first time any of us heard
of Gryphons and Gargoyles

3
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:14,723
was from your mother.

4
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:17,100
[Betty] Ben and Dilton kill themselves,

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,395
all to appease some creature
called the Gargoyle King.

6
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:24,733
Toxicology report revealed lethal levels
of cyanide in Mr. Doiley's blood.

7
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:26,735
There's something familiar about this.

8
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:27,819
We made a vow.

9
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:29,957
The secret we buried
all those years ago.

10
00:00:30,008 --> 00:00:31,865
Made a pact to
never revisit that.

11
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:34,993
- [Jughead] Do you have a player's manual?
- Flip for your fate.

12
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:37,203
- Promise to give me the scripture?
- Promise.

13
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:39,039
- Salut.
- [FP] You been playing the game?

14
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,707
- No.
- Don't lie to me, boy.

15
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,250
I see the blue on your lips.

16
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:45,795
[Jughead] No one will play, but that book
may be our best shot at figuring out

17
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:49,007
- what happened to Dilton and Ben.
- [Hermione] Our children are in danger.

18
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,458
- Where'd you get this?
- My locker.

19
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:52,093
Same with everyone else.

20
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,681
[Jughead] <i>A deadly mutating virus</i>
<i>had been introduced</i>

21
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,266
<i>to the ecosystem of Riverdale,</i>

22
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,685
<i>and it was spreading like an epidemic.</i>

23
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:04,773
<i>For every manual confiscated,
two popped up in its place.</i>

24
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:07,484
<i>And the ever-resourceful students
of Riverdale High</i>

25
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,652
<i>were playing it everywhere.</i>

26
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,156
<i>Why? Because for us,
the game was an escape</i>

27
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:17,368
<i>from our nightmarish reality,
a fantasyland at our fingertips.</i>

28
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:20,663
<i>But for our parents,
it was a death-dealing nightmare.</i>

29
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,124
Two students have taken their lives.

30
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:26,753
A third tried. The common
thread linking these tragedies:

31
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:31,049
all three victims were playing the game
known as Gryphons and Gargoyles.

32
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:34,260
You're admitting
the game killed Dilton and Ben?

33
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:35,720
Yes, Mr. Jones.

34
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,474
But where did G&amp;G come from?
Where did Ben and Dilton even get it?

35
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,351
We still don't have many answers,

36
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:45,396
but from the little that we know
about it the game seems targeted

37
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,273
at impressionable developing minds.

38
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,067
Namely, teens like yourselves.

39
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,402
Um... Challenge accepted.

40
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:52,695
Respect to the dead,

41
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:56,157
but some among our flock are shepherds,
not sheep.

42
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,743
The game's quests
and role-playing scenarios

43
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,370
are specifically designed

44
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:03,957
to foster delusion, paranoia,
and ultimately violence.

45
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,252
As mayor, I'm officially banning
Gryphons and Gargoyles.

46
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,964
Mrs. Burble is gonna be holding
extended office hours,

47
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:14,175
and I've set up a
24-hour crisis hotline,

48
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,136
overseen by Kevin Keller.

49
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,929
FYI, I am only there after school.

50
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:20,515
As a parent, I'm imploring you.

51
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,926
Take care of yourselves. And
stay away from this game.

52
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,493
[Veronica] Newsflash, Mom,
banning something

53
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,235
only makes it more interesting.

54
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,319
Thank you.

55
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,823
And now this stupid game is literally
all anyone is talking about.

56
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,616
You're not playing, are you, Vee?

57
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,828
Bee, you don't make <i>Fibes </i>20 Under 20

58
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:44,539
by prancing around the woods
in a deer carcass.

59
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,584
- Are you and Jughead playing?
- No.

60
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:51,129
We're trying to find out why my mom
and his dad were so triggered

61
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,589
by us having the manuals.

62
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,965
[phone rings]

63
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,802
- Hello?
- <i>Ms. Cooper, this is Dr. Curdle Junior.</i>

64
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:58,887
<i>Are you alone?</i>

65
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,600
Hi, Dr. Curdle.

66
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,144
Yes. Have you had any luck?

67
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:08,542
<i>Per your request, I did some
digging in the morgue archives.</i>

68
00:03:08,592 --> 00:03:10,677
<i>I found something I think
you'll be interested in.</i>

69
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:16,404
Dr. Curdle Junior told me and Jughead

70
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:18,907
that the circumstances
of Dilton Doiley's suicide

71
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,867
felt oddly familiar to him.

72
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,370
That file is why.

73
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,873
A case from when his dad was coroner.

74
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:29,209
I am right in the middle
of my affirmations.

75
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,169
Trust me, you'll wanna look at this.

76
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,640
Per your Farm "testimony,"

77
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,850
you've clearly played G&amp;G before.

78
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,937
Now I have concrete evidence
that when you were my age

79
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,690
there was another suspicious death,
maybe a murder,

80
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:56,861
that took place at Riverdale High
where the corpse had blue lips.

81
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:03,117
I can keep digging or you can just
tell me what you know about G&amp;G.

82
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,494
All right.

83
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,496
Wait, really?

84
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:13,044
You're right, Betty.
You deserve to know the whole truth.

85
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,840
If for no other reason,
for your own protection.

86
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,302
<i>It was our junior year.</i>

87
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:26,266
<i>Phones had cords, Winona had Johnny,
and everything smelled like teen spirit.</i>

88
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:29,811
<i>The world was a different place,
and we were very different people.</i>

89
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,980
<i>Back then, I was Alice Smith,</i>

90
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:34,482
<i>a bad girl from the wrong side
of the tracks</i>

91
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,900
<i>with enviable hair,</i>

92
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,402
<i>no real friends...</i>

93
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:39,821
Please no, please no, please no.

94
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,407
<i>...and one huge problem.</i>

95
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,452
Damn it.

96
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,037
[Alice sobbing]

97
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,625
[knocking on door]

98
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,335
[Hermione] Everything okay?

99
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:58,464
Mind your own business, Hermione.
Shouldn't you be in a church?

100
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,259
Oh, crap, girl. Are you...?

101
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:08,599
It's probably a false positive.
It happens all the time.

102
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,685
Like three percent of the time.

103
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,895
No one's talking to you, Sierra.

104
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:16,774
What am I gonna do?

105
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:20,862
I tried to talk to him. He blew me off,
for some Vixen he's screwing.

106
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:21,821
[chuckles]

107
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,365
Classic FP Jones.

108
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,451
- FP Jones?
- FP Jones?

109
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:28,870
Well, well, well.

110
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,080
I thought I heard a party in here.

111
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,540
Hall passes, ladies.

112
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,129
Oh, it's up your ass, Penelope.

113
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,799
Classy as always, Alice Smith.

114
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:46,137
Just curious,
were you born with that mouth,

115
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:50,350
or is it something Southside mothers
teach their bastard babies?

116
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:52,602
Wow.

117
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:58,858
[gasps]

118
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,029
You trashy bitch.

119
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,030
[gasps]

120
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,365
[chuckling]

121
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,492
Oh, no. No, no, no.

122
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:08,618
[grunting]

123
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:09,535
- Hey.
- Yeah.

124
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,246
- Get off.
- Ow!

125
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,164
Hey.

126
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,585
[Marty] Come on, FP.
It's Bulldog tradition.

127
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,213
[all] <i>Streak, streak, streak.</i>

128
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,673
- <i>Streak, streak, streak.</i>
- My arm's in a cast, Mantle.

129
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:25,051
- <i>Streak, streak, streak.</i>
- Doesn't matter.

130
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:27,220
- <i>Streak, streak, streak.</i>
- Streak.

131
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,888
- <i>Streak, streak, streak.</i>
- Streak.

132
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,181
Marty, I'm not doing it.

133
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:32,266
<i>Streak, streak, streak.</i>

134
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,227
I'll go with you.

135
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:38,481
Freddie Andrews.
Why? You're not even on our team.

136
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,150
No, but the baseball team got me
to streak last year

137
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,361
and it got me serious cred
with the ladies.

138
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,573
Run fast enough,
and all they'll see is a blur.

139
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,077
<i>Streak, streak, streak...</i>

140
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,663
[Alice] <i>We were invincible.</i>
<i>Or at least we thought we were.</i>

141
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:58,292
<i>That little stunt landed FP and Fred
in hot water.</i>

142
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,044
[school bell ringing]

143
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:06,134
Welcome... to Saturday detention.

144
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:12,640
[Alice] <i>Gathered in that classroom,</i>
<i>we were strangers more than friends.</i>

145
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:17,395
<i>And none of us could've guessed that
our lives were about to change forever.</i>

146
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,158
[Alice] It was just supposed
to be one Saturday.

147
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:34,829
Eight hours, six people,
with seemingly nothing in common.

148
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,539
<i>The bad girl.</i>

149
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,950
- [Featherhead] Alice Smith?
- [Alice] <i>The rebelling Catholic.</i>

150
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,168
Hermione Gomez?

151
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,795
- <i>The teacher's pet.</i>
- Penelope Blossom?

152
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,964
- <i>The artist athlete.</i>
- Fred Andrews?

153
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,591
<i>The political animal.</i>

154
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,134
Sierra Samuels?

155
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:51,762
- <i>And the ladies' man.</i>
- Forsythe Pendleton Jones, Jr.

156
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:55,016
<i>Forsythe Pendleton Jones, Jr.</i>

157
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:58,394
<i>He was the BMOC, an
all-American athlete,</i>

158
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,480
<i>a stud muffin, as we used to say.</i>

159
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,691
<i>He was different back then, Betty.</i>

160
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:07,195
<i>Trying to be something other than
what he was, but still trouble.</i>

161
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:14,494
I was as tough as nails,
but around FP, Silly Putty.

162
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,955
Even in detention,
with a secret growing inside me...

163
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:20,249
I hated him...

164
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:22,293
but I wanted him.

165
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:24,754
Okay, okay, Mom. I get it.

166
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,090
While you're here today,
you will not talk.

167
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:31,511
You will not play.

168
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,181
You will not move.

169
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,691
You don't even breathe.

170
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,569
- [Sierra clears throat]
- Yes.

171
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:49,862
What if we have to pee?

172
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:51,405

00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,505
Fred found him when he got home.

518
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:11,351
[Alice] <i>By the time Mr. Andrews'</i>
<i>funeral came around a few days later,</i>

519
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:15,647
<i>Principal Featherhead had been declared
officially missing.</i>

520
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:21,110
<i>And we were all waiting
for the other shoe to drop.</i>

521
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:24,708
It was a beautiful service, Fred.
I should've been there when he...

522
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:30,954
You have to stop beating
yourself up, man.

523
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,081
There's nothing you could've done.

524
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,916
- He was sick.
- And he died alone.

525
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,418
Because I was high,

526
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:40,964
running around school like an idiot,
with you guys.

527
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:43,049
Fred.

528
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:47,136
Look, between this
and Featherhead going MIA,

529
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,681
we're all a little on edge.

530
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:52,475
I saw him that night... at the school.

531
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,854
During the Ascension Party,
I saw Featherhead.

532
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,754
The next morning, he was gone.
Did anyone else run into him?

533
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,819
Do we tell someone?

534
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:07,866
You didn't... see... anything.

535
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,868
- Penelope.
- Nobody did.

536
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:16,040
Want the finger pointed at us
because we happened to be doped up

537
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,751
and trespassing
on the night Featherhead disappeared?

538
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,547
We don't know what,
if anything, happened to him.

539
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,799
And no one else knows we were there.

540
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,802
So, we keep our mouths shut.

541
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:29,846
Agreed? Agreed?

542
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,564
[Alice] <i>The rumors spread like wildfire.</i>

543
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:42,650
<i>Everyone had a theory about
what happened to Featherhead.</i>

544
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,028
<i>But no one guessed the gruesome truth,</i>

545
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:48,489
<i>that Mr. Featherhead had been
right under our noses.</i>

546
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:50,867
<i>And by the next week, it was impossible</i>

547
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,202

[groans]

549
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:17,644
There was blue liquid in the chalices
when I saw them.

550
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:19,604
Featherhead's corpse had blue lips.

551
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:22,190
And the police said
he had poison in his system.

552
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:26,027
- What did you guys do to him?
- What do you mean, what did we do?

553
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,655
You were there, too, Alice.

554
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:32,241
- And you're the only one that saw him.
- Because you guys were tripping.

555
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:35,995
And who was even wearing that insane
Gargoyle King costume, anyway?

556
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:40,291
What are you talking about?
We were in our normal outfits.

557
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,126
And the chalices were empty.

558
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:45,421
The Lady Smith doth protest
a little too much, methinks.

559
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,090
[Hermione] Yeah.

560
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,634
Pretty convenient that you left early.

561
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:52,428
Tell us what you did to Featherhead.

562
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,473
Wait. This is ridiculous.

Fred, you're the Radiant Knight.
You always do the right thing.

564
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:02,438
- You'll go to the cops with me?
- We're not telling the cops.

565
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:06,192
Why suddenly such a rule-breaker,
Penelope? Because you killed him?

566
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:09,862
And how would I have killed him?
With our magic chalices?

567
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:13,449
Yeah. The goblets were full
when I went into the bathroom, okay?

568
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:16,285
Maybe you poisoned them
when you set up the quest.

569
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,956
Except for I didn't set up the quest.

570
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:21,749
Neither did Daryl.

571
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,460
We were as in the dark
as the rest of you.

572
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:26,879
Guys,
the chalices were just sitting there.

573
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,090
Any of us could've drank from them.

574
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,592
So, whoever invited us
to the Ascension Party

575
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:34,929
was trying to kill one or more of us.

576
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,018
Then we have to destroy the game,

577
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:42,437
so it can't be traced back to us.

578
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,396

579
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:45,898

scatter everything else.

Juggie? Jug.

687
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:32,012
You won't believe the story
my mom told me last night.

688
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:39,061
Jug.

689
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:41,439
What are you doing?

690
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:43,441
Betty.

691
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:46,527

692
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:50,364

693
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:54,452
I'm on Level three. It's only a
matter of time until I ascend.
