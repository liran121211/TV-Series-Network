00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:13,013
-[shouts] Kurtz!
-What the hell?

3
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:15,140
[growling]

4
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,350
I'm willing to sell the Whyte Wyrm to you

5
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,602
in exchange for Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe.

6
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:23,106
It's about Jason.
The Farm gave me back my brother.

7
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:25,150
Edgar Evernever decided he wants

8
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:27,444
to adopt the twins after he marries Mom.

9
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:28,611
That can't happen.

10
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,613
I wonder, Betty, if you would consider

11
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,282
doing me a favor, as well.

12
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,284
Your dad and a few other inmates

13
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,953
were being transported
to my father's prison,

14
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,372
and there was some kind of accident.

15
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:40,790
There were no survivors.

16
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,379
Mr. Jones, what happened here?

17
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,340
We don't know yet. We're working on it.

18
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:31,549
It's him.

19
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,636
He's back. The Black Hood.

20
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,263
Betty's dad was on that bus.

21
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:40,016
He was being transferred
to Hiram's prison.

22
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,476
He's out there, Mr. Jones.

23
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:42,727
No, no. Betty.

24
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,188
No one survived this crash.

25
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,107
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,692
You know that he's dead?

27
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:50,777
You're positive?

28
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:55,198
There were five inmates on that bus,
one driver, six in total, which is...

29
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,536
It's the number of heads we found.

30
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:03,456
DNA tests will confirm it,
if we can't piece everyone back together.

31
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,125
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,922
Betty, we should go.

33
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:13,508
He asked for my help with this transfer.

34
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,343
He wanted this, Veronica.

35
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:18,221
What if he planned this?
What if he escaped?

36
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,558
He could still be out there.

37
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,274
Archie?

38
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,067
Mom.

39
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:37,615
I would've picked you up from the airport,
but Dad took his truck,

40
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,577
-and I'm not sure the jalopy's your speed.
-That's fine. I took an Uber.

41
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,871
Have you had breakfast yet?
We can go to Pop's. My treat.

42
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:46,666
Can we do dinner instead? I was gonna head
to the gym before school starts.

43
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:49,002
Your dad mentioned
that you'd taken up boxing.

44
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:51,671
-Said you were pretty serious about it.
-I am, yeah.

45
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,591
That's not why you came, is it?
To talk me out of it?

46
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,676
Not at all. Things were slow in Chicago,

47
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:59,679
and I just wanted to spend some time
with my son, that's all.

48
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,640
Have you come to steal more babies?

49
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:06,019
No, I came to warn you
that Dad might be on the loose.

50
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,479
FP already called.
There were no survivors.

51
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,441
Dr. Curdle Junior hasn't
identified the bodies yet.

52
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:12,483
We don't know that.

53
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:15,153
This is what I mean
about letting go of your past.

54
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:18,656
Stop indulging in these morbid delusions

55
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,784
that your serial killer of a father
is somehow still alive.

56
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,247
Did you get a tattoo?

57
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:28,499
Yes.

58
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:30,668
Edgar asked me to get it.

59
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,171
I like to think of it
as an engagement ring.

60
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:35,924
[Jughead] <i>How are you feeling?</i>

61
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,593
You mean,
considering that Mom abandoned me?

62
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:41,095
[Jughead sighs]

63
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,848
She didn't abandon you.

64
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,229
Mom leaving town is probably
the most selfless thing she's ever done.

65
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,939
I've never lived anywhere without her.

66
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,484
Well, I'm glad you decided to stay.

67
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,029
Just no more playing G&G, okay?

68
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:00,740
Why is everyone so freaked out about it?

69
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:03,993
It's just pretend quests and costumes.

70
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,787
Who was in costume?

71
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,332
Well, Ricky had those ears,
and I had a crown...

72
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,001
and the Gargoyle King, of course.

73
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,463
Wait, you met the Gargoyle King?

74
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:16,714
Like, in person?

75
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:19,384
-What happened?
-He gave me and Ricky a quest.

76
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:20,760
You talked to him?

77
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:24,013
-What did he say?
-That I couldn't enter the Kingdom.

78
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:27,100
Not until I had the Gospel.
That was our next quest.

79
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,393
The Gospel.

80
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:32,188
-What's the Gospel?
-I don't know. We never found it.

81
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:36,943
But Ricky said that the Gospel's
where the Gargoyle King

82
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,444
keeps all his secrets.

83
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,992
Good morning, boys.

84
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:47,453
And good news, Archie.
I've got your fight application.

85
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,747
-What are you talking about?
-For the Regional Classic.

86
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:52,083
Nice. That's a hot tournament.
How'd you get him in?

87
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,253
I'm very persuasive when I need to be.
You'll be ready.

88
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:57,338
You just gotta get your mom or dad
to sign off on it

89
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,548
so we can make the deadline.

90
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,509
This is the perfect opportunity
to jumpstart your boxing career.

91
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,805
Hey, if you ever wanna add
another client to your roster,

92
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:09,100
-I'd love to have a manager like you.
-I'll think about it, Mad Dog.

93
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:12,020
Guys? Old Faithful just opened up
in the locker room.

94
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,438
I think a pipe burst.

95
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:16,524
I turned the water off,
but someone should go look at that.

96
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:17,608
I'll fix it.

97
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,527
Suddenly you're a plumber?

98
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,112
-Bring in a professional.
-Ronnie--

99
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,364
I've actually been meaning to talk to you.

100
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:26,409
As your manager,
this gym has charm to spare,

101
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,910
but it could use an update.

102
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,455
-A little sprucing up.
-With what money, Ronnie?

103
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:31,831
Mine.

104
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,041
I'd like to invest.

105
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,542
In you and your gym.

106
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,502
La Bonne Nuit has been doing
very well lately,

107
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,130
and I wouldn't mind
diversifying my portfolio

108
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:41,174
to include a property on the Southside.

109
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,260
[Betty] <i>Can't be a coincidence.</i>

110
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:48,514
He asked for the transfer,
and then his bus just burst into flames.

111
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,768
He planned it. He used me to escape.

112
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,186
And now he's out there.

113
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,355
Betty, I was with you.

114
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,565
I saw what was left of that bus.

115
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:00,234
-Nobody could've survived that.
-Yeah, but if he did--

116
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,277
If he did,

117
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,404
you've got me, you have the Serpents,

118
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,948
you have Archie
and his fight club buddies,

119
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,326
you have a veritable armada
to protect you.

120
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,120
Also, you can move back in
with my dad and I.

121
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,955
Been a lot quieter
since my mom's been gone.

122
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,958
Mm... I'm sorry that she left, Jug.

123
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,460
How's JB doing after all this?

124
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:21,089
Shockingly well.
And she's filled in some key blanks.

125
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:24,884
Apparently there's a Gospel
of the Gargoyle King out there somewhere.

126
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:27,887
Could be important.
My dad's been sweeping Junkyard Steve's.

127
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,349
Sorry to interrupt
your no doubt thrilling catch-up, chums,

128
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:34,435
but, as you know,
junior prom is this weekend.

129
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,937
The theme is Fire and Ice.

130
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,398
And naturally, Toni and I are campaigning

131
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:41,150
to be the most captivating prom queens
this school's ever seen.

132
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,153
So, it goes without saying,
vote Choni for co-monarchs,

133
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,239
because when you really think about it,

134
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:48,366
no other options make sense.

135
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,536
Prom is this weekend?

136
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,247
We still do things like that here?

137
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,623
I mean, apparently.

138
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,209
Jug...

139
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,421
will you go to prom with me?

140
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,589
Only for you, Betty Cooper.

141
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,022
Hey. Peanut butter and banana.

142
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,650
Thought you might be hungry,
ready for a break.

143
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:26,279
Definitely. Actually, Mom,
I wanted to ask you something.

144
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:29,949
There's a tournament this weekend
that I wanna box in. The Regional Classic.

145
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,118
I need you to sign my application
to let me compete.

146
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:34,996
-Archie...
-Let me guess. You don't want me to box.

147
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:35,913
[chuckles]

148
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,207
I didn't even want you to play football.

149
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,876
And boxing is so much more...

150
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,461
brutal.

151
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,297
I'm behind on everything else,
but I'm good at boxing.

152
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,633
-I was actually thinking about going pro.
-Going pro?

153
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,261
I know you've been dealing
with a lot lately.

154
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:53,890
-Mom--
-But I won't support you getting pummeled.

155
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,283
[man] <i>Range is closing.</i>
<i>Please return your gear.</i>

157
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,374
Dr. Curdle Junior?

[Curdle Jr.] <i>Ms. Cooper, hello.</i>

159
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,836
Have you identified the bodies?

<i>The corpses were charred</i>

161
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,175
<i>but I was able</i>
<i>to work with one semi-intact hand,</i>

162
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,802
<i>and it matches your father.</i>

163
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,721
<i>DNA and fingerprints.</i>

164
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,306
<i>It's him, Ms. Cooper.</i>

165
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,809
<i>For good or ill, your father is dead.</i>

00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,254
Hey, Dad, have you seen Jellybean?

169
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,881
[FP] <i>I dropped her off at school.</i>
<i>Listen, I'm at Junkyard Steve's.</i>

170
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,717
-<i>You better get down here and see this.</i>
-Okay. I'm on my way.

171
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,856
Since this is where Kurtz brought you,

172
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,692
and where he was killed
by the Gargoyle King,

173
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:30,319
me and my men have been doing a sweep
of the junkyard,

174
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,238
and it led us to this bus.

175
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,580
Looks like this is where Kurtz...

176
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,125
and some other Gargoyles were crashing.

177
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:05,479
The Gospel.

178
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,160
-[school bell ringing]
-Veronica.

179
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,246
Uh, my mom signed.

180
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:26,208
-I can enter the Regional Classic.
-And not a moment too soon.

181
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,878
We can submit it now
and get it in just under the deadline.

182
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:29,795
Awesome.

183
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:33,591
Are you sure about this?

184
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:35,885
I love seeing you back in the ring,

185
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,346
but if the tournament's too soon,
we can send Mad Dog.

186
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,097
You can keep training, and go next year.

187
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,849
No, I'm ready. It's just, um...

188
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,726
I was wondering...

189
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,688
-What are you doing for prom?
-Prom?

190
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,899
Yeah,
I thought maybe we could go together.

191
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,151
-As friends.
-[chuckles]

192
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,529
I would honestly love that.

193
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,323
Yeah?

194
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,366
Great.

195
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,785
-Great.
-[Toni] Prom tickets here.

196
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,580
Get your prom tickets here.

197
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,957
Uh, actually, we'll take two, please.

198
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,878
Well, well, well.
What was off is now back on again.

199
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,214
You owe me a cherry phosphate.

200
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,007
We're just going as friends.

201
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,052
-In fact, we'll be paying separately.
-Whatever.

202
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:21,597
Just remember to vote Choni
for prom queens, okay? Thanks. Bye.

203
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,435
Cheryl, what are you doing?

204
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,729
Campaigning for prom queen
is strictly forbidden.

205
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,731
Forbidden? What's up with that?

206
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:31,941
The Farm prohibits it,

207
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,694
because it goes against
our strictures of equality.

208
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,029
Remember, the one become many,
the many, one?

209
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,864
Easy for you to say, Evelyn.

210
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,659
Aren't you like 30?
How many proms have you been to?

211
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,035
This is a test.

212
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,954
You can either be queens for one night,

213
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,707
or you can live in the glory of the Farm
for all of eternity.

214
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:48,791
Which would you prefer?

215
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,085
Honestly? Both.

216
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,932
There's a lot of mythical stuff
in this Gospel, Betty.

217
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:09,478
The Gargoyles were thought
to be evil spirits

218
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,814
that lived in the clouds,
preying on people.

219
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,859
So,
the Gryphon Queen turned them to stone.

220
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,318
They fell from the Kingdom,

221
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,696
-and shattered when they hit the earth.
-Jug.

222
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:22,116
All this lore builds up the Gargoyle King

223
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,827
to be some kind of supernatural creature,

224
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,288
but this guy's just a serial killer.

225
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:28,873
Just like my dad.

226
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:33,586
The Black Hood was flesh and blood,
and so is the Gargoyle King.

227
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:37,131
Which means...

228
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,303
that he can die.

229
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,933
Betty, if you need a couple days,

230
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,102
you can take a break.

231
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,020
No.

232
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,022
I need to keep moving.

233
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,150
I just want this to end.

234
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,527
[cell phone beeps]

235
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,198
It's Dr. Curdle Junior.

236
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,534
He's got results
from Kurtz's autopsy for us.

237
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,708
Hey, Archie, can I talk to you for a sec?

238
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,460
Yeah. Sure. What's up?

239
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:15,711
I know you're upset with me

240
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,755
that I wouldn't
let you enter the tournament.

241
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:21,008
And believe it or not, I'm really happy
that you've found something that you love.

242
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,343
I do love it, Mom.

243
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,345
Well, listen.

244
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,388
I called a recruiter
from the Naval Academy,

245
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,431
old friend of mine,

246
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,600
and they have an amazing boxing program.

247
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:30,893
Even scholarships.

248
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,395
So, you could box, and get an education.

249
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:35,981
Will you at least talk to her?

250
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,233
[chuckles]

251
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,068
Sure, Mom. Of course.

252
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:40,528
Thanks.

253
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,406
Judging by the healing,

254
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,493
I'd say Mr. Kurtz got
these tattoos last month.

255
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,787
Yet again, the same symbols

256
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,832
that were carved into Ben,
Dilton, and Baby Teeth.

257
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:56,168
The Gospel says you need these markings
to ascend to the Kingdom.

258
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:59,463
Maybe these tattoos are Kurtz's way
of trying to slip his way in.

259
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:03,592
Jug, whoever gave him
these tattoos could be a new lead.

260
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,646
Thanks for coming all this way, Brooke.
I owe you one.

261
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:18,232
Happy to help, Mary.
Buy me a drink later, we'll call it even.

262
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,901
Done and done.
Brooke, this is my son, Archie.

263
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:21,902
-Hi.
-[Archie] Hi.

264
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,904
So, you guys go way back, huh?

265
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:27,950
We do. We met at Sarah Florence.
We were roommates freshman year.

266
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,828
So, your mom tells me you're interested
in boxing for the Naval Academy?

267
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,454
Uh, possibly.

268
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,790
Well, the Academy's
physical education program

269
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,459
requires all midshipmen
to participate in boxing,

270
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,545
so, you'll have plenty of competition.

271
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,422
And as a member of the boxing club,

272
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,132
you train with the best.

273
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,760
But the Academy also prepares you
for life outside the gym.

274
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,971
Over four years,
you get a great education,

275
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,931
a college degree, and a job.

276
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,016
In the military?

277
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:54,685
Upon graduation,
you serve five years active duty.

278
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:58,355
Then by the time I'm finished,
my prime boxing years might be behind me.

279
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,150
Yeah, but that's why you need
to find something real to fall back on.

280
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:04,236
And many of our boxers go on
to have professional careers.

281
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:08,240
Our program is extremely competitive.
I'd wanna see you in the ring first.

282
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:12,661
You can set up an exhibition match,
so Brooke can see what you can do.

283
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,997
Yeah. Yeah, I can ask Fangs.

284
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,124
Great, let's do this Friday evening.

285
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,209
We'll be there.

286
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,336
[tattoo needle buzzing]

287
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,880
[knocking]

288
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:24,673
Got IDs?

289
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,508
Gotta be 18 or over to get inked.

290
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,511
Actually, we were wondering if you, um...

291
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,097
recognized this.

292
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,186
Matter of fact, yeah.

293
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,813
Kid came in asking for those symbols
a few weeks back.

294
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:40,898
Did he mention why?

295
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,775
No, just showed me the design,
and paid cash,

296
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,318
just like the first guy.

297
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,487
Wait. There was a first guy?

298
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,613
About a year ago,

299
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,865
I gave that same tattoo
to a different dude.

300
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,742
Same symbols, also on his back.

301
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:54,578
Do you have a name?
Maybe a photo, by chance?

302
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:55,621
Never ask for names.

303
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,290
Normally I like to take photos
of my finished work,

304
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,542
but this guy would not
let a camera anywhere near him.

305
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,877
No photos, huh?

306
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,879
Sounds like someone that I know.

307
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:05,798
What did he look like?

308
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,842
Sandy hair, blue eyes...

309
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,594
Weirdly magnetic?

310
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:12,763
That's the guy.

311
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,349
Mm-hm.

312
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:16,684
Thanks.

313
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,813
Evelyn told me what you've
been doing, Sister Cheryl.

314
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:26,527
She said that you've been campaigning
for prom queen.

315
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:28,278
Brother Edgar,

316
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:31,490
think about what it would mean
if I were prom queen.

317
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:34,952
Standing on that stage,
a crown on my head,

318
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,955
I could use that platform
to spread the Farm's message.

319
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,373
Cheryl...

320
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,583
do you like being a member
of our community?

321
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,919
Yes, immensely.

322
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,754
That is good.

323
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:48,590
But...

324
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,759
standing with us

325
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,302
requires sacrifice.

326
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:56,890
Now, if you can't let something
as trivial as prom queen go...

327
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:03,522
we can't have you speaking
with your brother Jason any longer.

328
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:11,155
I understand, and I'm done campaigning.

329
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:13,407
Just...

330
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,492
please, don't take Jason away.

331
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,163
[woman] No question.

332
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:22,875
This is a unique and handsomely
maintained property, Ms. Lodge.

333
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,585
I have no doubt
your loan will be approved.

334
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:26,253
That's great. Thank you.

335
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,632
Veronica, tell me you're not selling--

336
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:31,842
Absolutely not, Pop.

337
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:35,345
I'm just looking to get a loan,
to help Archie and his boxing gym.

338
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,139
I thought you and Archie...

339
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,891
We're just friends, Pop.

340
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:41,685
Friends and business associates.

341
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,282
You're over.

342
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:56,950
By six pounds.

343
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,245
Sorry, but you're not fighting, kid.

344
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:05,918
No, no, no. Commissioner.
I'll cut down. I'll make the weight.

345
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,587
By Friday? Good luck with that.

346
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,632
Friday?
I thought the fight was on Saturday.

347
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:12,716
Last-minute change.

348
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,969
The fight's at four.
But I can't let you in at this weight.

349
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:16,887
I'll be there.

350
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,098
Minus six pounds.

351
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:25,896
Jug, the tattoo artist said
that a guy with blond hair and blue eyes

352
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:28,941
got a Gargoyle King tattoo,
about a year ago,

353
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:31,443
right around the time the Farm
moved to town,

354
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:34,655
and right before any
of this game stuff started to happen.

355
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:37,908
Add the fact
that my mom just got a tattoo,

356
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,994
per Mr. Evernever's request.

357
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:42,412
Okay.

358
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,790
But if the Gargoyle King is Edgar,

359
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:48,460
then how does that explain your mom
seeing him during Ascension Night

360
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,088
nearly two decades
before Edgar got to town?

361
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:54,925
Well, who says that the new Gargoyle King
is the same person as the old one?

362
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,846
My mom gave testimony to the Farm
about the Midnight Club.

363
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:01,515
Edgar could have taken on that persona.

364
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:04,059
I know that Edgar's
been messing with your family.

365
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,269
Think about it.

366
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,688
Edgar bought the Sisters of Quiet Mercy,

367
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,857
where the game originated.

368
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:14,194
Both he
and the Gargoyle King preach ascension.

369
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,822
Both of them have followers
that they manipulate.

370
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:19,533
And they're both really, really creepy.

371
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,953
There's one way to settle this.

372
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:25,581
And fast.

373
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,334
I don't know if this is a cry for help,

374
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,379
or if you need to seriously refine
your taste in athletic wear.

375
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,256
I gotta lose weight for this fight Friday.

376
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,632
Are you sure that's enough time?

377
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:36,550
I'll do it.

378
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,136
Can you give me a ride back here after?

379
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,512
I gotta focus in the car.

380
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:41,638
Focus on what?

381
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:42,639
Another fight.

382
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:46,226
My mom invited this recruiter
to come see me box.

383
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:50,314
Archie, that's insane.
You can't fight twice in the same day.

384
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:53,233
Just invite your mom and the recruiter
to the tournament.

385
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:58,113
That's the thing.
My mom didn't sign that waiver. I did.

386
00:19:58,488 --> 00:19:59,656
I forged her signature.

387
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,575
She doesn't want me
to fight in this tournament.

388
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:05,370
So much so that she brought this recruiter
all the way from Annapolis, so--

389
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:08,248
So, you've gotta give her a good show.
I get it.

390
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:11,376
I'll make sure you get back here in time.

391
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:15,756
Many tribes, when their elders die,

392
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,635
would consume their bodies
to absorb the wisdom.

393
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,511
Very good question, Alice.

394
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,681
Now, who's next?

395
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,141
Me.

396
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:30,354
How about you admit
that you are the Gargoyle King?

397
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:33,148
Edgar, I am so sorry.

398
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,441
It's all right, Alice.

399
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:39,154
Clearly, whatever's on Betty's mind
must be very important.

400
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,697
Why don't you join us?

401
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:44,409
And we can unpack

402
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:47,829
this obsession you have
with the Gargoyle King.

403
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,039
I have a better idea.

404
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,042
Why don't you take off your shirt?

405
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,503
-Betty.
-I wanna see your tattoos.

406
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:55,629
I do have a tattoo.

407
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,716
On my wrist. It's an infinity symbol.

408
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,176
Just like many of us here.

409
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,930
I'm talking about the runic symbols
that would be on your back.

410
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,516
This is sublimation, Betty.

411
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,433
But...

412
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,061
I have nothing to hide.

413
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:12,813
Then prove it.

414
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,004
There.

415
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,842
Does that satisfy you, Betty?

430
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:55,374
Don't worry about it.
Should be a relief that your mom's

431
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,584
not marrying a second serial killer.

432
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,715
If not Edgar, then who?

433
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:07,094
If we're gonna catch the Gargoyle King,
it'll be on his own terms.

434
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:10,639
-His gospel?
-Yes.

435
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:13,350
I think that there's a ritual in here
that will help invoke him.

436
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:14,476
Just listen to this.

437
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:18,605
"After the false prophet is sacrificed,
the shire will have a bacchanal

438
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,941
to celebrate the coronation
of the Gryphon Queen."

439
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:24,152
-Does that sound like any school event?
-Junior prom?

440
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,237
"Upon her crowning,

441
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,531
the Gryphon Queen will ensure
the King's arrival

442
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:29,366
by subjugating herself,

443
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:33,161
and declaring that the one true monarch
of Eldervair is the Gargoyle King."

444
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,163
I'm assuming I'm the Gryphon Queen?

445
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,250
Right. We just have to ensure
that you're crowned Prom Queen.

446
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:42,337
So, maybe we switch the prom theme
to something G&G-related.

447
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:46,466
Assuming the Gospel is, well, gospel,
he's going to show up.

448
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,760
He's not going to ignore his own rules,
right?

449
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:52,097
We need to ensure
that you're elected prom queen.

450
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,557
So, what if we do all that,

451
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,892
and the Gargoyle King
still doesn't materialize?

452
00:23:56,351 --> 00:24:00,313
Then the prom is just another horrible
school event that we'll have to endure.

Hi, Cheryl.

We had an idea
that we wanted to run by you.

457
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:16,204
Now, we realize that our prom's theme,
Fire and Ice,

458
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,706
was decided months ago.

459
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,125
-But people don't know what that means.
-Right.

460
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:23,086
So, what if we specified the theme,
a little bit?

461
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:26,047
Maybe we call it something like,
The Renaissance?

462
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,592
Or Medieval Times?

463
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:29,509
Sure.

464
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:30,886
Whatever.

Yes.

I'm gonna let you fight another match.

Then I'll get her to come back.

My persistence is stronger
than your uppercut.

Since when? He was fine this morning.

00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:27,002
We think it's food poisoning.
I'd love to reschedule.

495
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:27,919
I can fight.

496
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,170
I can fight.

497
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:30,463
I can still do this

-I'm fine.

The Pretty Poisons don't take orders
from you.

00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:03,371
Please, Peaches,
we're talking about a Prom Night Truce.

00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,708
So that we can all work together
to catch the Gargoyle King.

507
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,085
How does that sound?

508
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,213
The Poisons can get behind that.

509
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:15,425
During prom, groups of you
will be stationed at every entrance.

510
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:17,552
Once the announcement
for Prom Queen begins,

511
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,138
you guys are gonna bar anyone
from exiting the gym.

512
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:22,807
Whoever's cosplaying
as the Gargoyle King is gonna be there.

513
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,559
It's our one shot at nabbing him.

514
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,811
-Will he be in costume?
-Maybe.

515
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:30,273
Maybe not. At the minimum,
he'll have some sort of kingly signifier,

516
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,400
like a crown, or antlers, and the like.

517
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,320
He's gonna make his move
after Betty is crowned Prom Queen.

518
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:37,280
Let's end this nightmare.

519
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,366
Once and for all.

520
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:57,759
Nice and slow.

521
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,552
You took a fall there, kiddo.

522
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:02,806
That's what happens when you try
to fight two matches in one day

523
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:05,100
after starving yourself for a week.

524
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,017
[Archie sighs]

525
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:08,603
Where's Ronnie?

526
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:11,481
I asked Veronica to give us some space

527
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,608
so we can talk about
what's really going on with you.

528
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:16,403
[groans]
I shouldn't have double-booked.

529
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:19,030
You shouldn't have forged my signature
and lied to me.

530
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,242
Not to mention,
risking your health, Archie.

531
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:23,159
And to what end?

532
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,412
Mom, I wanna be a boxer.

533
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:29,499
You were so excited about the recruiter
that I wanted to give your way a shot.

534
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,543
But I don't wanna join the Navy.

535
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:34,087
I don't wanna go to college.

536
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,797
That's a losing battle for me.

537
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,967
I want to see how far
these fists can take me,

538
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:39,968
and I wanna fight.

539
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,011
And you're 17 years old.

540
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:45,849
You're thinking about tomorrow.
I'm thinking about the rest of your life.

541
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:07,162
Pop, I'm closing La Bonne Nuit early
for the night.

542
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:08,997
Most of my regulars will be at prom.

543
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:10,957
Veronica.

544
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:12,667
What?

545
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:14,836
What's going on, Pop?

546
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:16,337
A few months back...

547
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,506
I found something out.

548
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,508
Something I should've told you.

549
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,762
You're gonna wanna sit down for this.

550
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:26,723

Well...

553
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:49,913
shall we, my lady?

554
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,081
Lead on, Hellcaster.

You two wanna vote for Prom Court?

557
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,800
-How's the turnout been?
-Lackluster.

558
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,135
Luckily, you're running unopposed.

559
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:07,764
Still, we don't want any... surprises.

560
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,144
So far so good.

561
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:15,730
I see the Serpents
and the Poisons are in place.

562
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:19,067
Now we just wait for the Gargoyle King
to make his move.

563
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,401
And you'll take him down.

564
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,530
I mean, imagine, Jug.

565
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:27,325
He may be in this gym right now.

566
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,039
Wanna dance while we look for him?

567
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,042
And before your coronation, Your Majesty?

568
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:36,960
Yes.

569
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:44,551
From the Back to School Dance
to the Junior Prom.

570
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,053
How much has changed.

571
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,515
Some things are still the same.

572
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,393
True.

573
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:55,687
Like my father.

574
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:56,604
Hey.

575
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:58,690
What's wrong?

576
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:01,067
Before I came here tonight...

577
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:06,197
Pop dropped a bombshell on me,
and I'm still reeling.

578
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:08,408
Apparently...

579
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:10,618
I don't own the diner.

580
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:14,455
My father does. And La Bonne Nuit, too.

581
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,249
But you bought it from your dad.

582
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:17,500
He tricked me.

583
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,503
He gave me a fake deed,
and kept the original.

584
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:22,463
All this year...

585
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,048
all this time...

586
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,926
I've been working for my father.

587
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,219
Everything I've made...

588
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:32,181
I put back into the business,
back into his pockets.

589
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:34,017
-Does he know that you know?
-No.

590
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:38,062
And I'm gonna act as though
nothing has changed.

591
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:40,273
I'm gonna do exactly what he would do,

592
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:42,692
manipulate him into digging his own grave.

593
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,612
That's our way through this mess.

And this time,
we can take down my father for good?

599
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,506
Hell yeah.

600
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,598
I'm sorry you won't get
to be Prom Queen, babe.

00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:16,976
I know how important it was to you.

602
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:18,978
It's okay, Tee-Tee.

603
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:23,024
Edgar gave me something better
than a Queenship.

604
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:24,943
Humility.

605
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:26,736
You can't mean that.

And suddenly being a Farmie is making
a lot less sense to me.

who got it from a centaur,

Hey, have either of you seen Betty?

627
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,395
Not gonna happen.

00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,005
I did what you asked.

No, the Black Hood.
The Black Hood is back, Jug.

651
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:58,669
It was a setup, Jug.

652

The Gospel that we found,
the Proclamation...

653
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,678
it was all to get me alone
with my dad again.

I can't believe none of us saw it coming.
The return of the Black Hood.

00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,975
Now we have
two serial killers running around.

656
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,935
Possibly working together.

657
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,604

00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:29,492
It's horrible, what happened at the dance.

660
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:32,495
I can't believe we were all in the gym
while that was going on.

661
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:35,164
I'm gonna stay in Riverdale
a little longer.

662
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:37,458
I don't want you alone
while your dad's away.

663
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:38,751
Okay.

664
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:40,628
That's great, Mom.

665
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:45,383
I'm gonna go for a run, if that's cool.

666
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,928
You're really committed to this,
aren't you, to boxing?

667
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:53,391
Well... I tried music, I tried football.

668
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,101
The world is such a scary place,

669
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:57,478
maybe it's not the worst thing
to know how to fight.

670
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,480
To be able to defend yourself.

671
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:02,149
Do you mean that?

672
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:04,110
If this is your path...

673
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:06,445
I wanna support it.

674
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:07,947
And you.

As long as you do it right.

676
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:10,950
I promise, Mom.

677
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:14,203
No more crash diets, or double-bookings.

678
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,915
Will you help me convince Dad?

679
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:19,583
[chuckles]

680
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:23,879
Mom.

681
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:26,966
-Betty, what are you doing here?
-Listen to me.

682
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:28,384
I was right.

683
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:29,718
Dad escaped.

684
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:31,929
He's back. I saw him.

685
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:33,139
No, they confirmed he's dead.

686
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:34,890
No, he survived.

687
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:36,684
He chased me during prom.

688
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,937
-He's killing people again.
-No, Betty. I left that all behind.

689
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,022
Mom, you have to deal with this.

690
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,942
Dad is back,
and I think he's coming here next.

691
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:45,860
What?

692
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:49,238
-Why would he come here?
-I told him about your engagement.

693
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:51,907
And how he plans to adopt the twins,
and he was really upset.

694
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:54,410
Why were you talking to that monster?

695
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:55,578
Because he fooled me.

696
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,288
What do we do?

697
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:00,124
[Edgar] You stay here.

698
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:05,087
Our walls are strong, Betty...

699
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:07,548
and our members stronger.

700
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,593
Let the Farm protect you, both of you.

701
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:14,763
Will you stay?

702
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:25,941
Yeah.
