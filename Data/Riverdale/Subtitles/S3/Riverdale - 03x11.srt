00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:09,718
<i>Previously on </i>Riverdale:

2
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:11,595
Tall Boy? We know
you're working for Hiram.

3
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:13,805
Why would he want the town quarantined?

4
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:17,226
- Apparently there was a mass seizure.
- Seizures aren't contagious.

5
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:18,352
So, what?

6
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,646
There's nowhere he won't follow me.
It's over?

7
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:25,025
You will stoop to any level
to get me back in your clutches.

8
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,236
I just wanted some father-daughter time.

9
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:28,362
Claudius Blossom.

10
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,989
You may not be the Man in Black,
but his stink is on you.

11
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:33,700
Sheriff Minetta's body was found
in the marsh last night.

12
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:34,993
It was decapitated.

13
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:38,163
No, Tall Boy was just trying to escape.
It was an accident.

14
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:40,624
As far as anyone knows,
Tall Boy's been exiled.

15
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:50,217
<i>Riverdale,
once a safe, decent, innocent place,</i>

16
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,010
<i>had become Noir Town,</i>

17
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:54,304
<i>like the setting
of a Raymond Chandler story,</i>

18
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:58,433
<i>filled with dames to kill for,
postmen who like to ring twice,</i>

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,560
<i>and more mobsters</i>

20
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:01,770
<i>than a Scorsese retrospective
at the Bijou.</i>

21
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:05,899
<i>We were a town of lost souls.
Each of us wrestling with demons.</i>

22
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:08,819
<i>Each of us with secrets
we were trying to keep.</i>

23
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,363
<i>Mine was on the large side.</i>

24
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,365
<i>Six-foot-five to be exact.</i>

25
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,825
Explain it to me once more.

26
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,077
We drove him to the bus station
at gunpoint,

27
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,788
- got him on a bus out of town.
- He murdered Joaquin.

28
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:22,165
You thought putting him on a bus
was enough punishment?

29
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:24,042
- I don't buy it.
- I made a decision.

30
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:26,336
I'm sorry you don't agree, but he's gone.

31
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,674
I'll pretend
like I believe you idiots for now.

32
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:34,469
I got my hands full
finding Hiram's would-be assassin.

33
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,348
Next time you see me, have a better story.

34
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:42,936
<i>I was covering up the death
of a wicked man.</i>

35
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,356
<i>But Tall Boy Petite wasn't
the only fresh corpse in Noir Town.</i>

36
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,026
<i>Claudius Blossom had taken the big sleep,</i>

37
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,987
<i>and my girlfriend, Betty Cooper,
had murder on the brain.</i>

38
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,574
<i>And murderers, in Betty's world,
needed to be brought to justice.</i>

39
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,284
It's infuriating, Dad.

40
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:01,079
<i>The Lodge Ledger</i> is calling
Claudius Blossom's death a suicide,

41
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:04,583
- but I think he was murdered.
- But if he ingested cyanide--

42
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,585
But how did it get in his prison cell?

43
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:10,213
A gift from his former partner-in-crime
Penelope, I'm guessing?

44
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:11,632
Poison does suit her.

45
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:14,009
Subtle, elegant.

46
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:17,804
But if nobody else is asking questions
about Claudius' death,

47
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,139
why are you?

48
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:23,268
Because it's black and white,
and wrong, Dad.

49
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:25,604
Penelope's been killing people for years.

50
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,273
She's literally getting away with murder.

51
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:32,486
Daryl Doiley was poisoned with oleander,
which is something only the Blossoms grow.

52
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:34,196
Featherhead, poisoned.

53
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,822
The nuns, poisoned.

54
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,282
And now Claudius.

55
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,117
I just can't prove any of it.

56
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:42,162
It's like she's committed
the perfect murders.

57
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:46,208
You've already found the pattern,
murders disguised as suicides.

58
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,586
Who else has died by suicide
near Penelope?

59
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,671
Think now.

60
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,089
Clifford.

61
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,091
But he hung himself.

62
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,092
Perhaps.

63
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,761
I wonder, though,
if that's the whole story.

64
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,430
Who was there that night?

65
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,016
Penelope.

66
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:06,603
And Cheryl.

67
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,397
If there's a witness,

68
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:10,565
it's not a perfect murder.

69
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:17,322
<i>Meanwhile, Archie Andrews
no longer felt hunted by Hiram Lodge,</i>

70
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:18,949
<i>but he was still haunted.</i>

71
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,576
<i>Trapped in that in-between place,</i>

72
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,496
<i>avoiding his destined face-to-face
with the Man in Black,</i>

73
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:27,165
<i>Archie struggled,
searching for a sense of purpose.</i>

74
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:28,834
What's going on, son?

75
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,962
- Is it your breakup with Veronica?
- No, Dad, it's not...

76
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,174
I've been thinking.

77
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,469
Maybe college isn't for me.

78
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:43,640
Maybe I can work with you
in the construction company again.

79
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:48,228
Well, there's no shame in hard work,
son, but where's this coming from?

80
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,981
After the crap I've seen
these last few months,

81
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:54,025
I just wanna get out of my head,
work with my hands,

82
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,319
try and make peace with things.

83
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,906
If you're serious about it,
you better get your butt in gear.

84
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,908
Shift starts in about an hour.

85
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,871
<i>The only thing
Archie knew for sure: he was angry.</i>

86
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,331
<i>And hitting things made it better.</i>

87
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,171
Meal break, boys.

88
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:17,966
Andrews.

89
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,260
This is a union crew.

90
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,637
You need to take your mandatory break.

91
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,014
Stop working.

92
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,146
When I say stop, you stop.

93
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,690
Back off. I don't need a break.

94
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,400
You don't want to do this, kid.

95
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,068
I got you by about 100 pounds.

96
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,786
That's it.
I don't care if you are Fred's kid.

97
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,829
- You're off my crew!
- The hell I am!

98
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,832
<i>With Hiram laid up
in the hospital clinging to life,</i>

99
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,877
<i>there was blood in the water,
and sharks were closing in</i>

100
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,087
<i>on the mobster's daughter, Veronica Lodge.</i>

101
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:57,923
From my family to yours.

102
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,426
While I love a grand gesture, Elio,

103
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:05,514
- diamonds are a girl's best friend.
- These are for your father.

104
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:08,975
I heard he's still in the hospital,
and I wanted to come here personally

105
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:13,188
- to tell you I'm praying he pulls through.
- Well, to paraphrase Samuel Clemens,

106
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:16,525
reports of his death
have been greatly exaggerated.

107
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,860
The vultures are circling, Veronica.

108
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:21,071
They're eager to swoop in
on his territory.

109
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,489
Talking about yourself?

110
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,658
I'm offering some friendly advice.

111
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:28,453
Jobs like the hit on your father,
it's very rare they go unfinished.

112
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,915
<i>Yes, we all had our problems.</i>

113
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,583
<i>The town was drowning in them.</i>

114
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,294
<i>A good-looking one was about
to walk through my door.</i>

115
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,384
Nice hat, Bacall.

116
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,013
I've got a job for you, Jones.

117
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,391
I want you...

118
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,269
to find out who shot my father.

119
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:57,148
You'll get the other half
when you give me their name.

120
00:05:58,692 --> 00:05:59,693
That is a big job.

121
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:05,782
Half the people in this town wanna
see your old man kick the maple barrel.

122
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:07,200
- No offense.
- None taken.

123
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,077
I'll give you your first suspect.

124
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:15,876
My mother. A few weeks ago,
I overheard my parents arguing.

125
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,920
It was right before the quarantine,
after I had my seizure.

126
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,797
No. I supported you.

127
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:23,717
- You swore that this wouldn't happen.
- What is going on?

128
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,886
<i>My mother was berating my father.</i>

129
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,804
Something about breaking a promise.

130
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:33,602
- What if you don't like what I find?
- I'm a big girl.

131
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,811
I can take it.

132
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:36,646
Well, then...

133
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:40,108
Consider me your Philip Marlowe.

134
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:43,695
<i>I didn't mind playing detective,
especially for this price.</i>

135
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:47,282
<i>But if I'd known then and there
where this investigation would lead me,</i>

136
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,868
<i>I never would've taken the money.</i>

137
00:06:56,625 --> 00:07:00,211
- To what do I owe the pleasure?
- I'll just get right to it, Madam Mayor.

138
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,048
- You shoot your husband?
- Excuse me?

139
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,384
- I love my husband.
- Uh-huh. But did you shoot him?

140
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,929
I hear not all is well at The Pembrooke.

141
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,722
Records and witnesses will attest,

142
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,141
I was on the phone with Hiram
when he was shot,

143
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:15,518
picking up lunch at Pop's.

144
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:18,480
What were you and Hiram arguing about
when Veronica had a seizure?

145
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,482
Well, Mr. Jones, if you must know...

146
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,860
we fought
because I caught Hiram having an affair.

147
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:28,365
I had been suspicious for a while,
so, I had Sheriff Minetta follow him.

148
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,451
This was before he was butchered,
of course.

149
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:33,703
And he...

150
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,456
gave me these.

151
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,295
Now, I don't know who she is,

152
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,173
but they met regularly
at the Five Seasons.

153
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,634
But Hiram having another woman
is good motive to shoot him.

154
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:48,927
No, it isn't.

155
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,721
I simply asked him to end it, and he did.

156
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,599
I'm telling you this
because I have nothing to hide.

157
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:58,311
Keep those. I mean, who knows?

158
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:01,272
Maybe Hiram's mistress was angry
when he called it quits.

159
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,358
You do know how volatile blonds can be.

160
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:11,533
No. You're not going to the job site today
after you picked a fight yesterday.

161
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:15,203
I was trying to do my job.
It wasn't my fault. And then Vic--

162
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:18,540
Vic? Vic who has worked for me
for a very a long time?

163
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,167
- Who knows what he is doing?
- Fine. Whatever.

164
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,461
No. We're not done here, young man.

165
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:26,923
You wanna explain to me
how I found this in your bedroom?

166
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:30,385
You think you're the first kid
to take a drink in high school? No.

167
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,430
- This does not solve your problems.
- I'm out of here.

168
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,390
Fine. Take a walk. Clear your head.

169
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:38,560
While you're out there,
think about how you need to shape up!

170
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:46,276
We are gathered today
to mourn the passing of one of our own.

171
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:49,946
Betty.

172
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,241
Sweet, darling Betty.
You've come to pay your respects.

173
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:57,537
Well, Uncle Claudius was family, so...

174
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,705
Mourn with us, cousin.

175
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:09,007
Tragically, this ungrateful town never
welcomed Claudius to its bosom.

176
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:13,094
And I believe that is why
he committed the most cardinal of sins...

177
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,638
taking his own life.

178
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,684
Crocodile tears.

179
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,484
While I appreciate the company,

180
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,612
tell me,
what are you really doing here, Betty,

181
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,155
at our uncle's funeral?

182
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,364
I came to talk to you.

183
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:39,245
Cheryl, people connected to your mother
keep dying by poisoning,

184
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,664
or by strange suicides,

185
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,208
including your father.

186
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,502
My father...

187
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,380
hung himself in a barn, Betty.

188
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,925
He slipped a rope around his neck

189
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,427
and kicked a maple barrel out
from under him.

190
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,471
End of story.

191
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:58,306
Is everything okay?

192
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,184
Betty was being a gnat,
as usual, Tee-Tee.

193
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:04,270
- And I don't have any patience for it.
- Back off, Betty.

194
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:06,314
It's been a rough day.

195
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,820
Sweet Pea, Fangs.
Why bring me here? I'm on a case.

196
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:15,448
I heard the Gargoyle Gang is riled up.
They're looking for Tall Boy.

197
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:19,119
And as long as his body's down here,
it's a ticking time bomb.

198
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,704
Yeah, well,
it's too hot to move him right now.

199
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:22,664
Hey.

200
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,583
Let's not lose our heads.

201
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:28,378
Okay? Fangs,
I need you to stay here with Tall Boy.

202
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,047
And I need you to lock this place up.
I'm serious.

203
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,550
Sweet Pea,
you need to tail someone for me.

204
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,181
<i>Nico, Leo.</i>

205
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:41,808
We're in a crisis.

206
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:45,395
The mob underworld smells blood,
and we need to change the narrative.

207
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,523
Obscure the fact
that my father's down for the count,

208
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,692
and present a strong front.

209
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,402
- Too late.
- People are talking.

210
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,780
No one's seen the Man in Black.
No one's collecting the vig.

211
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,740
What? Why the hell not?

212
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,160
We should get out there
and start collecting, immediately.

213
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,287
Nico and I have been discussing options.

214
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,040
It might be in your family's best interest
to align with the Grandes.

215
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:07,792
You mean Elio's family?

216
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,795
- Not gonna happen.
- Your father took a bullet

217
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:11,880
two inches from his heart.

218
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:14,424
If we're not careful,
our next play could be our last.

219
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:18,303
I don't need you to mob-splain
what's best for my family.

220
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:21,055
Due respect, you're not being realistic.

221
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,184
Due respect, you're fired.

222
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,644
- Both of you.
- Seriously?

223
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,439
You're getting rid
of the only capos you have left?

224
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,692
The same two clowns who didn't
protect my dad from getting shot?

225
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:34,152
Yeah, no, we're good.

226
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,784
I consider you both inner circle.

227
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,953
Smithers, as my former doorman,

228
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:47,874
and Reggie,
as my jacked jack of all trades,

229
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,919
I asked you here
because I need people I can trust.

230
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:55,215
Our enemies are sensing weakness,
and we need to show strength.

231
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:56,591
Veronica, if I may...

232
00:11:56,883 --> 00:12:01,054
There was a moment, back in the trenches,
when our numbers were greatly diminished.

233
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:05,558
We knew the enemy would storm
the barricade at any moment.

234
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:09,312
I collected the helmets from our dead,
and propped them atop our bayonets.

235
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:13,107
High enough so that they'd be visible
to our enemies and give them pause.

236
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:15,026
See, sometimes,

237
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,195
it's not what things are,

238
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,280
it's what they appear to be.

239
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,785
You've just given me an idea, Smithers.

240
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,287
But we're gonna need
your bus driver's cap.

241
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:33,836
So, who's this blond bombshell
that you're tracking?

242
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:35,296
Hiram's mistress.

243
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:38,174
He broke things off with her.
She may want revenge.

244
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:42,595
Concierge tipped me off about the floor,
but I wish they'd given me a room number.

245
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,265
Well, maybe there was no room number
to give.

246
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,980
- Thanks for coming with me, by the way.
- My pleasure.

247
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:55,733
My investigation is on hold
until I hear back from Dr. Curdle Junior.

248
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,195
Turns out,
there was no autopsy on Claudius.

249
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,407
Penelope had him cremated
before he could perform one.

250
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:06,244
I'm hoping there's something
in Clifford Blossom's autopsy report.

251
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,913
No one's home. Let's move on.

252
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,291
Would Bogart move on?

253
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:12,959
Let's just give it a try.

254
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,629
What kind of hotel room is unlocked?

255
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:32,353
And now apparently there's
a not-so-secret sex club in Riverdale.

256
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:42,947
Excuse me.

257
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,244
What is this place?

258
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,663
The Maple Club.

259
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:54,667
A safe place,
as long as you know the safe word.

260
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,921
You seen this woman? She come here?

261
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,674
You just scared off my client.

262
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:15,480
She doesn't work here,
but I see her around.

263
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,024
Try Room 311.

264
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,778
Laura, why did Mr. Arklight leave
in such a rush?

265
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,073
Why are you two here?

266
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,950
You know this is a private club. Get out.

267
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,035
You mean a brothel?

268
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:34,207
By the way, does the new sheriff know
there's a red light district in Riverdale?

269
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:40,088
My time is costly, children,
so, what do you want?

270
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:45,259
I knew you were an escort, Auntie,
but now you're exploiting other women?

271
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,472
These women aren't victims, Betty.

272
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,476
At The Maple Club,
it is the men who suffer.

273
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:56,020
We specialize in domination.

274
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,731
These ladies make enough
to start new lives.

275
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,567
Oh, please. You are only helping yourself.

276
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:02,819
And why shouldn't I?

277
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,279
No one else ever has.

278
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:06,781
When I was eight years old,

279
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,866
<i>I was plucked
from the Sisters of Quiet Mercy</i>

280
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,076
<i>by the Blossom family.</i>

281
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:13,162
You poisoned the Sisters
because they sold you to the Blossoms?

282
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,289
I didn't kill those nuns. And, anyway...

283
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,751
it was the so-called monsignor
who sold me,

284
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,294
- not the Sisters.
- Fine.

285
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:22,422
You didn't kill the fake nuns.

286
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:23,631
Did you kill Claudius?

287
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:27,885
- He committed suicide, so I was told.
- It's pretty convenient, don't you think?

288
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:31,639
Either way, I was right here
when the poor man died.

289
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:33,683
Ask any of my girls.

290
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:38,146
<i>Fun fact of the day:
Penelope is the madam of a kink club.</i>

291
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:40,356
Okay, her sob story
doesn't change the fact

292
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,150
that she's a stone-cold murderer.

293
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,778
Wanna check out Room 311?
I could use one of your bobby pins.

294
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:51,742
It's Curdle. Maybe he tracked down
Clifford's autopsy report.

295
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:54,203
And just like that,
you are back on the case.

296
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:57,373
- No rest for the wicked.
- Not in a wicked town.

297
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:00,460

I'm a paying customer, Reggie.

305
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:41,167
- I'll leave when I'm ready to leave.
- Veronica's dealing with enough crap.

306
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,669
She doesn't need you making a scene.

307
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,589
Can I get another bartender
in here, please?

308
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,925
- Another bartender? Don't touch me.
- Let's go.

309
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,677
Hey, Toby. Toby.

310
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,638
It's okay. I know him.

311
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:55,598
He's our friend.

312
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,934
It's okay. I'll go.

313
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,853
- I'll go.
- I got him.

314
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,230
I got him. It's fine.

315
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:05,691
God.

316
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:08,653
Josie.

317
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:11,572
You can't tell Veronica about this.

318
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,867
Listen up, Andrews.

319
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,120
You are in free fall,
and I am not having it.

320
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,332
It's time for a literal, and metaphoric,

321
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,416
cold shower.

322
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,752
Wait. Wait, Josie, don't--

323
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,133
<i>At the docks,
it was a classic con:</i>

324
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:34,804
- <i>Smoke and mirrors with a pretty girl.</i>
- Collecting for Lodge.

325
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:39,308
- Where are Nico and Leo?
- No longer in our employ.

326
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:40,768
I'm Veronica.

327
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:44,063
I'm sure you know my father, Hiram Lodge.

328
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,987
He doesn't like to be kept waiting,
and neither do I.

329
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,243
See you next week.

330
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,000
Well played, Ms. Veronica.

331
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:05,835
Thank you, Smithers.

332
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,129
And you, too, Man in Black.

333
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:14,343
Apologies for the delay, Ms. Cooper,
but this one took some digging.

334
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:17,638
Clifford Blossom's wife requested
that there be no autopsy.

335
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,725
But my father was nothing
if not a curious man.

336
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,936
So, let me guess.
He performed one anyways?

337
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,982
What does it say?
That he died of asphyxiation by hanging?

338
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,443
There was bruising around the esophagus,

339
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,278
consistent with a hanging.

340
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,196
However...

341
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:38,034
there was also tetrodotoxin
in his bloodstream.

342
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,160
Puffer fish venom.

343
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,997
In Clifford's case,
the dose was almost certainly fatal.

344
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,292
So, you're saying Clifford
may not have died from hanging,

345
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:50,004
- but from being poisoned.
- I'm saying that

346
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:53,424
Clifford Blossom was already dead
when he hung himself.

347
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,761
<i>And Betty Cooper thought, "Gotcha."</i>

348
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,017
What's this?

349
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,227
Um, lemon, ginger, and cayenne.

350
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,234
Where is your dad?

351
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:13,569
He's at work.

352
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:17,948
I got canned on my first day,
so, I went to drown my sorrows.

353
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:20,660
Look, Archie.

354
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:24,121
I know we didn't talk much last year,

355
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:28,334
and I can't even attempt to guess
at the hell that you've been through.

356
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:31,796
And maybe all you can do now
is wallow in booze,

357
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:32,922
and pick fights.

358
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:36,967
But personally, I think you need
to channel your anger

359
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,761
into something constructive,

360
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,430
like music, maybe.

361
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,808
- Josie--
- Or...

362
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,936
if you're in the mood to hit things...

363
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,814
Kevin's dad boxes at the gym.

364
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:54,151
Either way, you've gotta deal
with your demons head-on.

365
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:57,738
I thought I did.

366
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,700
<i>In the cabin, I thought I faced my demons.</i>

367
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:02,868
And killed them.

368
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:07,957
And myself.

369
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,251
You're losing me.

370
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,544
You're right, Josie.

371
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,088
I gotta face this head-on.

372
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,717
And there's one person
I still haven't seen

373
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,260
since I've been back in Riverdale.

374
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:21,095
Archie, where are you going?

375
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:25,307
I'm going to face,
and kill, one last demon.

376
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:30,104
<i>That's one thing
about being a crime boss:</i>

377
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,440
<i>You learn to never leave a paper trail.</i>

378
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,986
<i>But Hermione Lodge,
it seems, was out of practice.</i>

379
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,572
What the hell is this, Mom?

380
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,241
I was entering today's take
into Daddy's ledger

381
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:45,536
when I noticed a shady collection
of invoices and receipts.

382
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,580
So, I dug a little deeper.

383
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,333
And Daddy's Fizzle Rocks empire?

384
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,253
You're a part of it, Mom.

385
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,088
No.

386
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:59,592
You ordered the quarantine.
You paid these invoices.

387
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,803
- It's your name in blood-red ink.
- No, Veronica.

388
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:07,725
I found out that your father
and Claudius were making drugs

389
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,978
in the new prison,
and at the Blossom Maple Factory,

390
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:13,397
so, I told him to shut it down.

391
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,025
I even helped him create a distraction,

392
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:18,486
so he could do it quickly and cleanly.

393
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:19,695
The quarantine.

394
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:20,988
It was a smoke screen.

395
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,450
But then, typical of your father,
he lied to me.

396
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,202
Instead of shutting it down,

397
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,330
he consolidated everything
into the prison. Believe me.

398
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,624
Veronica, I want no part of this.

399
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:34,668
We agree, then.

400
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,379
Let's end this nightmare.

401
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,882
Destroy the drugs,
and the means of production.

402
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,133
Burn it to the ground.

403
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:42,843
While Daddy can't lift a finger
to stop us.

404
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:45,554
Now, that is one option, yes.

405
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,140
Or we could sell it.

406
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,851
I already have a buyer lined up.

407
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,977
All-cash offer.

408
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:55,189
He's willing to take the drugs,
the lab, everything.

409
00:21:57,233 --> 00:22:00,736
Shouldn't we get something in return
for all the pain he has caused us?

410
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,366
It's over, Auntie Blossom.

411
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:06,951
I know what you did.

412
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,828
I know what happened in the barn.

413
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,956
How you faked Clifford's hanging
and lied to the police.

414
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,334
And who is your witness? Cheryl?

415
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:20,256
Proof that you poisoned Clifford
with puffer fish venom.

416
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,465
You'll go to jail for this.

417
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:24,802
Won't be justice for everyone you killed,
but it's a good start.

418
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:29,640
You think you know what I've done,

419
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,685
but have you paused to consider why?

420
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:37,606
Because you're a serial killer,
a black widow.

421
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,067
The Red Dahlia, let's call you.

422
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:41,986
You poison people.

423
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:44,196
Not people, Betty.

424
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:46,824
Men.

425
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:51,370
I'm not admitting anything,
but they are the true poison.

426
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,247
Clifford killed my son.

427
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,082
Daryl was a Judas.

428
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,417
And Claudius...

429
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:59,211
I'm surprised
you're not thanking me for that.

430
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:00,838
Why would I thank you?

431
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,631
Because he caused your seizure.

432
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,009
He caused everyone's seizures.

433
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,554
Claudius was running
a Fizzle Rocks operation

434
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:11,015
from our once-distinguished maple factory,

435
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:14,268
and dumping the runoff
into Sweetwater River.

436
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:17,855
- Fizzle Rocks caused the seizures?
- No, Betty.

437
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,566
The runoff from the manufacturing
of the drug.

438
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:21,650
Not the drug itself.

439
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,819
But why did it only affect girls?

440
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:29,158
I am an herbalist, Betty,
not a medical doctor.

441
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:33,203
Tests on Sweetwater Reservoir
were ordered and faked.

442
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,582
But Claudius had every intention

443
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,710
of continuing
to poison the town with drugs,

444
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,464
so, it was fitting that poison be his end.

445
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:48,594
Just because someone is a horrible person
doesn't give you the right to kill them.

446
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:49,845
Doesn't it?

447
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:53,307
Isn't that what you did
with the poison that infected your home?

448
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,642
The imposter Chic?

449
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:57,686
Hal tells me things, too.

450
00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:00,606
<i>When you delivered Chic to the Black Hood,</i>

451
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,232
you sent him to his death.

452
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,443
You're not so innocent, Betty.

453
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:07,321
And if you insist on turning me in,

454
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,699
I will gladly do the same to you.

455
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,328
<i>And that is when Betty realized:</i>

456
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:17,164
<i>No one's innocent in Crime Town.</i>

457
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,210
<i>Certainly not
Hiram Lodge's mystery mistress.</i>

458
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,099
What are you doing in my room?

459
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:38,102
That's a good question.

460
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:40,354
Here's another one.

461
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:43,190
Why's a water inspector got a gun?

462
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,151
I only wanna talk, Ms. Mulwray.

463
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:48,487
Who the hell are you?
How do you know my name?

464
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,447
It's the Glamourge Egg, right?

465
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,075
You shoot me, I'll drop it.

466
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,247
I've seen one of these before.

467
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,667
Hiram gives them as gifts.
Maybe in your case, payment.

468
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,294
And it costs more
than you'll make in a lifetime.

469
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,214
So, put it down before you break it.

470
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:11,635
Based on the things I found in your room,
here's what I know about you.

471
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:14,096
You're a health and sanitation inspector.

472
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:17,266
Must pay quite a bit
if you can afford the Five Seasons.

473
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,728
- Unless Hiram put you up.
- But I'm no kept woman.

474
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,731
I do a job, I get paid for it.

475
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:27,526
Report says you were sent
to investigate Riverdale's water supply.

476
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:30,529
Specifically,
Sweetwater River and Reservoir. Why?

477
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:34,199
Young women in town were having seizures.

478
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:35,534
I was sent in to help.

479
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,077
Brought in by Hiram Lodge.

480
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,663
He also make you write to Governor Dooley,

481
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:42,458
advising him
to support a town-wide quarantine?

482
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,126
You see, I'm confused,

483
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:47,921
because the letter says the water's dirty,
but the report says it's clean,

484
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:50,591
you either lied to the governor
or faked that report.

485
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:53,927
- Or both.
- You know what?

486
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:58,390
Break the egg if you want. I don't care.

487
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:01,810
Just get out of my room
before I call hotel security.

488
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:11,236
<i>Why was Hiram faking
water test reports? What was he hiding?</i>

489
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,530
<i>What did any of this have to do
with who shot him?</i>

490
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:16,450
Yeah.

491
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:20,287
<i>I followed Hermione Lodge
like you asked. You better get out here.</i>

492
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,499
Stay down, and keep quiet.

493
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:31,215
Is that...?

494
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,258
It can't be.

495
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:36,720
Sheriff Minetta's alive?

496
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:40,432
- Thought he was decapitated.
- Nope. From the sounds of it,

497
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:42,976
he and Hermione
have been having an affair for months.

498
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,979
- Wait, listen.
- There's too many people asking questions.

499
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:49,149
Which means,
our little outstanding problem,

500
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:52,277
you need to take care of tonight.

501
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:54,113
Now clear the decks.

502
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,282
Use your old sheriff's gun.

503
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:00,494
Then all signs will point to FP.

504
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,871
- They're talking about framing my dad.
- For what?

505
00:27:03,831 --> 00:27:05,707
I have to figure it out and warn him.

506
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:30,899
<i>Back in an eerily deserted
Riverdale General,</i>

507
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:33,152
<i>Archie Andrews was a man on a mission.</i>

508
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,946
<i>On a collision course
with his dark destiny.</i>

509
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:43,287
<i>After months of torment
at the hands of the Man in Black...</i>

510
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:49,626
<i>he was trying to bring a sorry chapter
in his life to a close...</i>

511
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,171
<i>the only way he knew how.</i>

512
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:04,766
- I need to talk to you.
- There's something at the hospital.

513
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,935
No. You can't go there. It's a setup.

514
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,480
Hermione and Minetta-- He's alive.

515
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:13,108
They plotted together to kill Hiram Lodge.

516
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:14,193
- What?
- Yes.

517
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:16,987
They're going to finish the job tonight
and pin it on you.

518
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,198
- Minetta's alive?
- Dad, there is a lot you need to know.

519
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:20,949
I just got back from the coroner's office.

520
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:24,912
A week ago, the torso
of a Michael Minetta was found

521
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:26,288
without its head and hands.

522
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:29,666
But it wasn't Sheriff Minetta,
because I just saw him.

523
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:32,169
- He's very much alive.
- Oh, my.

524
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:35,088
- Someone must've made a grave mistake--
- Save it, Junior.

525
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:37,007
Who asked you to fake Minetta's death?

526
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,053
Hermione Lodge.

527
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:45,098
I saw Minetta and Hermione,
up at some secret love shack up north.

528
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:48,310
I heard them talking about setting you up.

529
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:52,231
She'll try to put Hiram's shooting on you.
You need to arrest them.

530
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:53,315
I can't do that.

531
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,526
Yeah, you can. You're the sheriff.

532
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,404
They've been trying to murder Hiram Lodge.

533
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:00,322
No.

534
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,033
No, they didn't.

535
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:06,620
I shot Hiram.

536
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:08,914
- What?
- Hermione came to me.

537
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,749
She wanted it done. And I...

538
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:13,293
I wanted revenge.

539
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,754
You think I forgot about Riot Night?

540
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,466
That son of a bitch came close
to getting you killed.

541
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:23,637
I've been biding my time,
waiting for the perfect opportunity.

542
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:27,891
If you and Hermione tried to kill Hiram,
why'd she appoint you sheriff?

543
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,269
Payment. It was my payment.

544
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:34,356
I was naive enough to think
the office of the sheriff would protect me

545
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,149
if Hermione got an itch
to double-cross me.

546
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:37,651
Guess I was wrong.

547
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,197
Guess it's lucky
that you have me in your corner.

548
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:45,701
I have a confession to make.

549
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:47,911
About Tall Boy.

550
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:51,957
There's a way
that I can solve both of our problems.

551
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:54,167
But we'll need Ms. Cooper's help.

552
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:58,213
I came here to end our story.

553
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,966
When we first met, I was a scared kid,

554
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,927
afraid that I could lose everything.

555
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:08,223
You took me under your wing,
taught me to use fear as a weapon.

556
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,434
And for a while, it worked.

557
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,561
But it also hurt people.

558
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:17,107
Of all the horrible things you've done,
you know what enrages me the most?

559
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,985
That after my father was shot
by the Black Hood,

560
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,404
and almost died in my arms,

561
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:24,656
you hired some stooge...

562
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,743
to take another shot at him, in our house.

563
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:34,666
Maybe it's time I balance the scales.

564
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:44,676
A shot for a shot.

565
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,552
FP. Alice.

566
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:29,304
- Hermione.
- What's going on here?

567
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:31,515
Perfect timing. We'll start the interview.

568
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,892
All right, FP, let's check the levels.

569
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,144
- What, I just start talking?
- Yeah.

570
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:39,147
Well, Madam Mayor,
I am pleased to announce

571
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,566
that we caught the man
who shot your husband.

572
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:46,321
You did?

573
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,990
- Who was it?
- Gerald Petite.

574
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,743
But you might know him as Tall Boy.

575
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:55,330
It seems that Hiram kept him alive
in a secret cabin in the north,

576
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:56,415
to carry out...

577
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,333
odd jobs for him.

578
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:02,337
Can you imagine that?

579
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:05,757
Tall Boy resisted arrest, got violent,

580
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:09,052
and unfortunately,
I was forced to discharge my sidearm.

581
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:12,597
He died on the way to the hospital.

582
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:17,310
Well, thank goodness it's over.

583
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,146
And so neatly, too.

584
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:23,066
You know,
I would love to interview you next.

585
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:27,320
Get your perspective as mayor,
and wife of the victim, of course.

586
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:29,489
That's a great idea, Alice.

587
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:33,243
It's important that the mayor and I both
go on the record about what happened.

588
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,786
Present a united front.

589
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:38,874
Don't you agree, Madam Mayor?
That we should be on the same page?

590
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:40,459
Yes.

591
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:43,170
I think we are.

592
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:47,215
I think my mom may have hired someone
to shoot my father,

593
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:50,677
so that she could make a profit
from the sale of his drug operation.

594
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:52,345
- Damn.
- I know.

595
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:53,972
So, we need to act fast.

596
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,349
Tonight we're gonna break into the prison,

597
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:57,392
find the drugs,

598
00:32:57,476 --> 00:33:01,271
and destroy them, and the equipment,
before my mom sells everything.

599
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,773
Sounds a lot like the plot of <i>Bad Boys II.</i>

600
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,234
I'm in, Ronnie.

601
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,862
But why? If she's selling it--

602
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:11,698
I'll be damned
if my mom gets a payout for her crimes.

603
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:19,289
Archie? What happened?

604
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:26,213
- I gotta go.
- To meet Archie?

605
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:27,506
It's not what you think.

606
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,800
But can you handle our heist
on your own, Bad Boy?

607
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:32,177
Yeah.

608
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,197
- How is he?
- Alive, thanks to you.

609
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:55,033
But, Archie, what were you doing here?

610
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:57,661
I...

611
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:00,038
came looking for you.

612
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:05,377
Reggie may have told you
what happened at the speakeasy,

613
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,962
how I was acting like an ass.

614
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,965
I wanted to apologize. I wasn't myself.

615
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:14,010
- I haven't been for a while.
- I'm sorry, too.

616
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:18,265
That I ever thought for a second
that you shot him.

617
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:21,351
At some point, maybe I could have.

618
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,563
But I don't hate him anymore, Veronica.

619
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:30,110
He's awake.

620
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:32,320
And he wants see you.

621
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,118
And, Archie...

622
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,580
If you ever need a friend to talk to...

623
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:56,386
Archie Andrews.

624
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:00,932
Veronica told me what happened.

625
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,603
How I have you to thank for being alive.

626
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:15,614
We've been locked in battle for some time.

627
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:19,117
I never set out to be your enemy,
Mr. Lodge.

628
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,871
All I want is
to live in Riverdale in peace.

629
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:25,665
Well...

630
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:28,293
I see no reason for us to keep fighting.

631
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:30,420
So,

632
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:31,838
starting tonight...

633
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:34,424
I propose a truce.

634
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:38,595
You don't make a move against me,
and I won't make a move against you.

635
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,847
A life for a life.

636
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,657
- What are you gonna tell your mom and dad?
- I don't know.

637
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:00,700
Maybe the truth.

638
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:03,995
But probably not.

639
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,466
<i>Meanwhile,
in case you'd forgotten,</i>

640
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:19,010
<i>Betty's encounter with Penelope
had shaken her worldview.</i>

641
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:21,638
<i>There was only one person
she could talk to about it.</i>

642
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:25,100
Penelope's guilty.
I found proof that she poisoned Clifford.

643
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,601
My clever daughter.

644
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:28,978
What do you plan to do next?

645
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:30,188
I'm not sure.

646
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:34,442
I thought if I caught her,
I'd turn her in.

647
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:36,152
But hearing her talk,

648
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:38,905
seeing how she's living her life,

649
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:40,699
how she's been twisted...

650
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:42,951
I don't know, I feel almost feel...

651
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,327
Pity for her?

652
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:45,870
Penelope and I,

653
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:48,456
we're products of our environment,
raised by those

654
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,501
who taught us a twisted sense
of right from wrong.

655
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:55,422
Do you still believe that she's a monster
who deserves to be in here?

656
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:58,049
Maybe not every murderer is guilty.

657
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,886
And maybe not every victim is innocent.

658
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,847
Maybe it's not all black and white.

659
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:08,810
I wonder, Betty, if one day,
you'll ever be able to see me

660
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:11,813
in that same compassionate light.

661
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:20,989
Well, how you feeling, Red?

662
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,074
- Better.
- Good.

663
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,994
Thank you for taking care of me.

664
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:27,495
Setting me straight.

665
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:30,540
Sometimes we all need a little tough love.

666
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:34,335
I was thinking about your advice, too.

667
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:36,254
Doing something constructive.

668
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:39,382
- Would Mr. Keller talk to me about boxing?
- For sure he will.

669
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:41,968
And, uh, I was thinking,

670
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:43,428
maybe we could...

671
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:46,264
I don't know,
if you wanted to jam sometime, or...?

672
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,934
- Like the old days?
- Yeah.

673
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:53,480
Yeah, sure.

674
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:54,939
Let's do it.

675
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,025
But you're singing backup.

676
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,360
- Okay.
- Okay.

677
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,783
What the hell did you do?

678
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:07,076
I assume you're talking about the drugs.

679
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:10,622
Reggie and I burned them last night,
with the equipment.

680
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:14,083
But I told you I had a buyer lined up.
They paid in advance.

681
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:16,586
So, I saved you
from being a drug dealer, Mom.

682
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:20,340
- Might I suggest you offer them a refund?
- I can't, Veronica.

683
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:23,259
I used the cash
to pay off Governor Dooley.

684
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:25,011
To keep our names clean.

685
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:28,223
And now my buyer is coming,
and they are gonna want blood.

686
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:32,727
- You have no idea what you've just done.
- I know exactly what I did.

687
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,438
And I know what you did, Mom.

688
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:37,982
And I'm not the only one on your case.

689
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:44,739
You think you're really smart, don't you?

690
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,991
You have all the answers.

691
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:49,786
I know Hiram's mistress works
for the Sanitation Department

692
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:52,622
and doctored false water reports
for your husband.

693
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:53,873
I see.

694
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,125
Is that all?

695
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:57,085
No.

696
00:38:58,545 --> 00:38:59,838
Not in the slightest.

697
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,090
Betty told me about the runoff

698
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,634
from the Fizzle Rocks manufactured
at the factory.

699
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:08,471
How it poisoned Sweetwater River,
gave everyone seizures.

700
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,224
That's why Hiram had
to doctor those reports.

701
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:12,308
To cover his ass.

702
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:14,894
It's also why he moved his drug lab
to the prison.

703
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:17,188
Away from the water supply.

704
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:21,276
Now, my guess is
that you were pissed about his drug lab

705
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:24,070
and what it was doing
to all the girls in the town.

706
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:28,700
Soon after, you hired my father
to shoot Hiram Lodge.

707
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,326
When that didn't work,

708
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,579
you tried to finish the job
in the hospital with Minetta

709
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:37,166
and a sheriff-issued pistol
so that you could pin it all on my dad.

710
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,711
Oh, and I also know why you did it.

711
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:41,296
Veronica.

712
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:44,424
You knew Hiram was responsible
for her seizure.

713
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,134
Very good, Mr. Jones.

714
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,386
But you forgot one thing.

715
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,765
Last year, Hiram hired Tall Boy

716
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:55,226
to take shots at me
during the mayoral debate,

717
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:56,936
nearly killing me.

718
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,564
So, that's what this was about? Revenge?

719
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:04,152
So that you could run off with Minetta?
Live a happy little life together?

720
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:07,405
You can't tell anyone about this.

721
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:09,616
Not Veronica, no one.

722
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:10,950
Because if I go down...

723
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,494
your father goes down.

724
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:15,163
And that's a promise.

725
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:16,998
So, I think...

726
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:19,667
we should agree...

727
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:22,629
to keep each other's secrets.

728
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,048
Don't you think?

729
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:32,388
<i>So,
Hermione and I were deadlocked.</i>

730
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:33,681
<i>In a stalemate.</i>

731
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:35,600
<i>Much like Hiram and Archie.</i>

732
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:37,685
<i>And Betty and Penelope.</i>

733
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:39,896
<i>As for Minetta?</i>

734
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:43,274
<i>I didn't imagine there was much
to worry about.</i>

735
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:44,943
Grab me a cigarette, will you?

736
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:47,028
Of course, Michael.

737
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:51,991
We gotta talk about what to do
with FP and his kid.

738
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:55,870
Your husband always had a simple way
of tying up loose ends.

739
00:40:58,247 --> 00:40:59,332
He did, didn't he?

740
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:09,425
<i>Perhaps, in Riverdale,
the best you could hope for wasn't to win,</i>

741
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:12,178
<i>but to draw, and pray not to lose.</i>

742
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,764
Working late, I see.

743
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,936
I assume you're here to find out whodunit.

744
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:23,272
After my father woke up,
it was the first thing he asked me.

745
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:26,818
- I told him it was Tall Boy.
- Did he believe you?

746
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:27,735
I think so.

747
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:32,448
If it's good enough for my father,
it's good enough for me.

748
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:36,869
Second half of your payment.

749
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,461
You don't wanna know who really did it?

750
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,759
Forget it, Jughead.

751
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,054
It's Riverdale.
