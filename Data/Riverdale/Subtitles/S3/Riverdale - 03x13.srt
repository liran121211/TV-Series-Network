[narrator] <i>Previously on </i>Riverdale:

2
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:10,801
[crowd cheering]

3
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,554
[Norton] That kid is a star.

4
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:13,722
Can I kiss you?

5
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:14,806
Archie.

6
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:18,393
You broke the code.
Turn in your jackets and go.

7
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:20,020
I'm a Serpent by blood.

8
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:23,190
- What's this?
- [Cheryl] A gang, and you're the leader.

9
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:26,527
[Veronica] I think my mom may have
hired someone to shoot my dad,

10
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,738
so she could make a profit
from the sale of his drug operation.

11
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:31,657
Let's end this nightmare.

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,993
Find the drugs and destroy them,
before my mom sells everything.

13
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:36,157
[Hermione] What did you do?

14
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:38,455
I used the cash from the sale
to pay off Governor Dooley.

15
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:41,375
And now my buyer is coming
and they are gonna want blood.

16
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,585
Here's your money.
Or as much as we could get of it.

17
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:46,421
We'll figure out a payment plan
for the rest.

18
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:52,219
[Jughead] <i>Gryphons and Gargoyles.</i>

19
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,388
<i>Serpents and Ghoulies.</i>

20
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:58,016
<i>Riverdale was a veritable jungle
of mythological creatures,</i>

21
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,811
<i>species jockeying for power...</i>

22
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,146
<i>and at the dark heart of it all...</i>

23
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,566
[Gladys] Good morning, sunshine.

24
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:07,067
Wakey, wakey.

25
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,444
Breakfast is served.

26
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:11,280
Wow, Mom.

27
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:12,655
[chuckles]

28
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:15,409
It's way better than the normal breakfast.

29
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:18,620
- Morning.
- Morning.

30
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:21,999
- Sleep on it wrong?
- There's no right way to sleep on a couch.

31
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,542
- Want the bed?
- No, I'm fine.

32
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:25,877
I need coffee.

33
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,188
- You let her drink coffee?
- [chuckles]

34
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:33,302
[chuckles] Okay. It's fine by me.
Help yourself.

35
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,054
I gotta get to work. Hey.

36
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:37,681
You need anything, call me.

37
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:45,105
- Morning, Betty.
- Morning, Mom.

38
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:49,109
Is that your wedding dress?

39
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,110
It is.

40
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:52,946
I'm getting it altered.

41
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:57,034
Why, are you getting married?

42
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,912
In a sense.
I'm being baptized into the Farm.

43
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:05,834
I'm sorry. You're what?

44
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,544
Edgar says I'm finally ready.

45
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:10,464
All of the women from the Farm
are gathering Sunday night

46
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:11,548
at the new facility.

47
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,891
[Hiram] <i>Mija,</i> can I see you for a moment?

48
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:27,731
I'm getting caught up on things.

49
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:33,028
Hopefully you could answer a question
that's been nagging me.

50
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,113
In the short time I was laid up,

51
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:39,201
some very valuable equipment
and stock went missing from my prison.

52
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:44,414
Didn't Mom say that she had
to have it destroyed because of the feds?

53
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,668
Yeah, she did.

54
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:53,298
Tall Boy, an ex-Serpent, tried to kill me.

55
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,593
FP, an ex-Serpent, is now sheriff.

56
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:59,846
Gladys, a Toledo Serpent,
is back in town after years away.

57
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:04,142
And suddenly,
I'm out some very valuable assets.

58
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:07,479
If I didn't know better, I'd say
the Joneses pulled a fast one on me.

59
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:11,858
They strike me as opportunists,
not master schemers.

60
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:14,778
At a minimum, they'd need the help
of someone close to me

61
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,780
to pull anything like this off.

62
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:19,532
Oh, well.

63
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,702
The truth will shake out.

64
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,205
It always does.

65
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:32,212
- How about we skip class...
- [chuckles]

66
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,922
catch a matinee at the Bijou?

67
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:36,967
Oh, wow, you are sweeter
than a strawberry milkshake, Arch,

68
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,845
but I've got a meeting
with our college advisor.

69
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,681
Maybe we can meet up after school.

70
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,683
- I'm training with Mr. Keller then.
- Oh.

71
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,978
Are there any college scholarships
for boxing?

72
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,689
No, but stepping
in between those ropes, Josie,

73
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:53,400
it gets me and keeps me
in a good headspace.

74
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,568
Helps me focus.

75
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,321
Forget about everything outside the ring.

76
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,034
Well, almost everything else.

77
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,830
Yeah, well, just don't go messing up
that pretty face, Andrews.

78
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:08,498
It's growing on me.

79
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,085
It was the weirdest thing, Jug.

80
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,379
My mom's usually rubbing the Farm
in my face,

81
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:16,506
but now she's shutting me out.

82
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,467
Like she's washed her hands of me.

83
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,844
Which is even more terrifying.

84
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,555
And they're definitely up
to some serious shadiness,

85
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,849
like they're entrenching.

86
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,518
I was trying to dig up some dirt online
on the Farm.

87
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:31,146
Couldn't even find a photograph
of Edgar Evernever.

88
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,564
Not one, Jug.

89
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:33,648
That's weird.

90
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:36,651
You really wanna protect your mother,
maybe it's worthwhile

91
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,237
just embracing this whole baptism thing.

92
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:41,198
Or at least pretending to embrace it.

93
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,658
Might help to keep tabs on her,
make sure she's safe.

94
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:46,619
Come on.

95
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:49,289
[speaking indistinctly]

96
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,627
- Where is everyone else?
- We're down another eight.

97
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,962
- Another eight?
- [Sweet Pea] All girls.

98
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,255
Where are they all going?

99
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,758
Turns out Toni and Cheryl started
their own gang.

100
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:02,677
- All the girls are defecting to it.
- The Pretty Poisons.

101
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,556
So, what do you want us to do, boss?

102
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:08,182
Nothing.

103
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,936
This is all
because I banished Cheryl and Toni.

104
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:14,648
I need talk to Toni,
get her back into the Serpent fold.

105
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:15,891
The rest will come back, too.

106
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:18,360
They need to be reminded
what it means to be a Serpent.

107
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:20,445
I'll make this right.

108
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,113
[Keller] <i>One-one-two.</i>

109
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:26,534
Spider.

110
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:33,124
Your hand up, right? It's the first thing
I learned boxing in the Army.

111
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,794
You got a nasty habit
of telegraphing your punches.

112
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:39,965
You do that with an experienced fighter,
he'll see you coming from a mile away.

113
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:44,219
With all due respect, Mr. Keller,
those guys at L&L sure as hell didn't.

114
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:49,349
Get me a fight, a real fight,
with some of the guys training here.

115
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,976
- I can show you.
- Archie.

116
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,562
You've got good speed, all right?

117
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:54,896
And you got some power.

118
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,900
But you got no technique.
You have to learn that.

119
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:01,403
Until you do,
don't think about your first fight.

120
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,947
How long are we talking about?

121
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,199
Archie, you're not ready.

122
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:09,494
How can we know that
until you get me in the ring?

123
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:12,414
I need to know
if boxing is a viable option for me.

124
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:16,918
Trust me. Boxing is not something
you wanna do half-assed.

125
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,922
Good workout. Hit the showers.

126
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,846
This week's payment.

127
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,893
So, here's the deal.

128
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:36,855
My dad suspects that you
and FP are behind his recent troubles,

129
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:40,066
that you came back to Riverdale
to steal his drug trade.

130
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,485
Why is that my problem?

131
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,988
Because he's fired up
about rebuilding his empire

132
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,907
and you don't wanna get in his way.

133
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,327
Also, maybe you don't want him to find out

134
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:55,040
that Mommy tried to sell his business out
from under him, am I right?

135
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,041
No comment.

136
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,124
[laughs]

137
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,210
Clue me in on your dad's moves,

138
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,796
and that debt you owe me,
I might ease it slightly.

139
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:05,634
You want me to spy on my father? For you?

140
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,263
- That's not gonna happen.
- I don't wanna cause a drama here.

141
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:14,267
I just wanna get what's owed to me.
Plus a little bit more.

142
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:19,564
And now it looks as though I'm in a race
with your dad to rebuild the candy trade.

143
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:21,191
Who do you wanna be in charge?

144
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:22,942
Me...

145
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:24,568
or him?

146
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:25,861
You.

147
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:29,658
I want my family out of drugs.

148
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:32,202
We both want the same thing.
What's the problem?

149
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,080
Either you get Hiram out of my way...

150
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,959
or... sniff out what he's doing.

151
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,461
Let me know, so I can stay ahead of him.

152
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:47,550
I know what you're after, Elio,
but it ain't happening here.

153
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,553
Any boxer in this dump would be lucky
to fight Randy.

154
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,556
- It's just good business.
- [man] For you, sure. Not for me.

155
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,561
Elio.

156
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,564
Archie Andrews? You training here?

157
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,065
Yeah.

158
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:07,946
And if you need an opponent for your guy,
I'll do it. I'll fight.

159
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,251
How many bouts do you have
under your belt?

160
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,281
Well, none.

161
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,160
But I gotta get in the ring.
Otherwise, what's the point?

162
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:18,707
It's your lucky day.
Congrats, you just got your first fight.

163
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,085
One condition.
I need you to guarantee that you'll lose.

164
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,004
Are you serious?

165
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,883
Throw the fight,
make Randy here look good doing it.

166
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:33,805
No, Elio, I'm not taking a dive.

167
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:37,142
It's a golden opportunity
to start to make a name for yourself.

168
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,310
That's how it goes. Start building a rep.

169
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:42,063
First step to becoming a champ
is fighting a champ.

170
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:45,233
Boxing's like any other profession.
You gotta pay your dues.

171
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:48,737
But in this case, you also get paid.
Five thousand dollars.

172
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,407
- For one fight?
- Three rounds, that's all.

173
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,243
My guy gets another win,
you get on the board.

174
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,621
For a guy like you,
this is as good as it's gonna get.

175
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,499
I wanna get paid first.

176
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:03,584
Today. Now.

177
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,837
Half now, half after the fight.

178
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,341
You'll thank me, Red.

179
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,342
Let's go.

180
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:24,397
I'm worried about you, Daddy.
About our family.

181
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,942
I know you were dealing drugs.

182
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:29,818
But the drugs,

183
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,405
and the equipment you used
to manufacture them,

184
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:33,490
it's all gone.

185
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,118
You have an opportunity to go clean.

186
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,829
- To build a new empire.
- No.

187
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,084
- What opportunity were you thinking?
- Refocus on your prison.

188
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:45,794
Get it back on track.

189
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:48,171
You can fill the cells with criminals

190
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,882
and make more money
imprisoning drug dealers

191
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,217
than supplying them.

192
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,468
And it's legal.

193
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,094
That's good.

194
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:02,727
But you're thinking too small.
Here's what I'm thinking instead.

195
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:07,524
Penny Peabody used the Ghoulies
to manufacture, distribute, and sell...

196
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:09,650
candy.

197
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,904
Now that she's MIA, her gang is...

198
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,115
Well, it's leaderless.

199
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:16,741
Up for grabs.

200
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:21,246
If I gain control of the Ghoulies,
I regain control of the trade.

201
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,964
You're a Topaz.
Being in the Serpents is your birthright.

202
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:36,219
We are a family. I'd like you
to reconsider joining the gang.

203
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:38,513
You want me back in the Serpents?

204
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:40,264
Make me queen.

205
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,102
I mean, since I'm legacy and all, right?

206
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:45,645
[sighs]

207
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,314
- You know I can't do that.
- Because of Betty, right?

208
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,609
Then I'm not coming back.

209
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,113
What do the Pretty Poisons provide you
that the Serpents can't?

210
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,408
An opportunity to lead.

211
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,287
With the Pretty Poisons, I rule.

212
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:07,333
- We're a sisterhood.
- You're Cheryl's vanity project, you mean.

213
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,881
And you're wrong
about the Serpents still being family.

214
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,551
That's what we used to be. Not anymore.

215
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,640
Alice, you're gonna look
like heaven on earth.

216
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,852
[Alice] What do you think, Betty?

217
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,689
I think it's really pretty, Mom.

218
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,150
I'm so happy you decided
to be a part of this.

219
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:36,112
- You know how much this means to me.
- Of course, Mom.

220
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,241
Oh. Uh, Alice, I need those forms back.

221
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:41,826
Oh, right. They're right here.

222
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,453
What forms?

223
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,536
Just boilerplate.

224
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,581
Elizabeth.

225
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:52,378
What kind of baptism requires
a signed release form

226
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,589
exculpating the organization

227
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,800
in case of "bodily harm or death"?

228
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,385
[Alice] It's a standard form.

229
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,805
I signed one scarier
when I joined 23-Hour Fitness.

230
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,513
Your mother is on the verge
of discovering something

231
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,144
people spend their lives looking for
and never find.

232
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,813
No need to be afraid or stand in the way.

233
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:13,066
Um, there is if she's gonna get hurt.

234
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,903
It's just like Edgar said.
You're a detractor.

235
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,364
But I'm not gonna let you ruin
this day for Mom.

236
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:23,868
Fine, but if Mom dies,
then her blood is on your hands, Polly.

237
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,830
[sighs]

238
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,125
You look beautiful.

239
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:33,378
My father's going after the Ghoulies.

240
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:37,298
He says they're the cooks and the runners,
so, if you wanna win this war,

241
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,801
you need soldiers to fight it.

242
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:41,261
Well...

243
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:45,848
it looks like the pretty bird
bought herself another day.

244
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,935
Keep up the good work, little magpie.

245
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,150
Hey, hey, hey.

246
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:58,820
You took a fight against Randy Ronson?
Are you nuts?

247
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,906
The guy is 12-and-0 with ten KO's.
You haven't fought a round.

248
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:05,451
I have to prove myself somehow.
Elio's giving me a chance to do that.

249
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:08,955
Ronson, he fights dirty.
He sucker-punched one of his opponents.

250
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,874
The guy nosedived into a stool.
He hasn't walked since.

251
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,460
Archie, you make the call,
you cancel the fight,

252
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,212
or you find yourself a new coach.

253
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,842
[Cheryl] <i>Archers, draw.</i>

254
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,054
Anchor your hand
at the corner of your mouth.

255
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,307
Use your dominant eye.

256
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,810
Now relax, my pretties.

257
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:32,979
Release.

258
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:35,397
Brava.

259
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,066
Now go again.

260
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,235
Nice work, Poisons.

261
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,446
They have an excellent mentor.

262
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,614
They certainly do, babe.

263
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:49,620
Something wrong, <i>mon trésor?</i>

264
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,079
Jughead.

265
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,875
He tried to convince me
to rejoin the Serpents.

266
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,336
That worm. What did you say?

267
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,338
No, obviously.

268
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:01,466
He had the audacity
to call us a vanity project.

269
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:03,551
But don't worry, babe.

270
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,887
I'll find a way to put him in his place.

271
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:13,810
[sighs]

272
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:21,402
Time to show Jughead
just how poisonous we pretties can be.

273
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,115
- Heads or tails for this. Ready?
- Heads.

274
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,410
- Tails, mine. [laughs]
- Tails, what?

275
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:32,246
- [Sweet Pea chuckles]
- [Fangs] Oh.

276
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,832
- [Sweet Pea] Hey.
- [Fangs] Well, ladies. Evening.

277
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,169
Uh, look, girls.

278
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:41,756
We don't want any trouble
from your little sorority.

279
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,425
Don't call us girls,
and don't belittle us.

280
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:48,179
Or what?
You gonna challenge us to a pillow fight?

281
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,682
Seriously, Cheryl, what is this?

282
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,601
We're the Pretty Poisons, peabrain.

283
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,230
And we're here to deliver a message
to you and your leader.

284
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:00,274
That we are not to be dismissed,
or trifled with.

285
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:04,737
Ladies, introduce yourselves.

286
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,199
- Hey, we just don't want any trouble.
- Take it easy.

287
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:09,951
[thudding and grunting]

288
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,036
[Fangs and Sweet Pea] Hey, hey, hey!

289
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,332
- Ow.
- You guys are a joke.

290
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:21,879
Jug, if you don't get your house in order,
more people are gonna defect.

291
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,006
More gangs will start popping up.

292
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:28,261
And the Serpents' little piece of the pie
is gonna get smaller and smaller.

293
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,556
Store's open for suggestions, Mom.
You got any?

294
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,974
You need numbers.

295
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:36,602
Now, I happen to know for a fact,
the Ghoulies are up for grabs.

296
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:40,940
Ever since I took care of Penny,
they've been leaderless. Recruit them.

297
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:44,402
The Ghoulies tried
to burn down Pop's on Riot Night.

298
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,947
So, tame them,
and give them something they want.

299
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,700
Trust me.
This is your only shot at survival.

300
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:59,750
Hey, Tee-Tee. Check out my new nail color,
called Vigilante Violet.

301
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:00,710
What do you think?

302
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,671
I heard what you and the girls did
to Sweet Pea and Fangs.

303
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:07,967
The Serpents needed to know
the Pretty Poisons are here to stay,

304
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,429
- and we're not to be trifled with.
- I said I was going to handle it.

305
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:14,599
The purpose of our gang isn't
to air out your petty grievances

306
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,559
or to pursue your personal vendettas.

307
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,603
It's for protection and community.

308
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,271
I sent a message, planted a flag.

309
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:24,942
Cut the crap, Cheryl. Let me ask you this.
Is this gang mine or yours?

310
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:30,740
It's... yours, of course.

311
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,993
Then never deploy the Poisons
that way again without asking me.

312
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:35,744
Is that clear?

313
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:38,456
As a bottle
of sparkling San Junipero water.

314
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:48,965
- Hey.
- Hey.

315
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:53,930
[chuckles] So, I'm singing a little Tina
at La Bonne Nuit on Sunday night,

316
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:56,641
and I wouldn't mind having you on guitar.

317
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:57,724
- Sunday?
- Yeah.

318
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,436
I can't. I got a match.

319
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:02,939
What, your first fight?

320
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,022
Yeah.

321
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,484
That's major, Archie.
Why didn't you tell me?

322
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:08,694
[sighs] I'm gonna lose.

323
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,280
With that attitude, yeah, you are.

324
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,950
No, I'm the fall guy.
I get paid to throw the fight.

325
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,326
Oh, hold on.

326
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,328
That sounds shady.

327
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,411
It's a shortcut.

328
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,124
It'll get me in the game,
get my name out there.

329
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:26,629
It's like, before you can be a headliner,
you gotta be an opening act.

330
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:30,675
[groans] But getting paid
to be beaten down?

331
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:34,470
Josie, I'm an ex-con
who walked out of the SATs, remember?

332
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:38,474
Look, you've been dealt
some truly rotten hands, Archie, no doubt.

333
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:41,269
But you've gotta turn it around
for yourself.

334
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:42,186
With dignity.

335
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,480
It's a lot of money. Five grand.

336
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:47,358
Oh, wow, five grand. That's...

337
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,735
That's what you think you're worth?

338
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:55,741
I know you're looking for something.
We all are, in this messed-up town.

339
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:59,245
But selling yourself out
to be somebody's punching bag?

340
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,914
No, you're worth more than that.

341
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,961
[Betty] <i>Kev, I need your help.</i>

342
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,464
- Betty, what is it? What's wrong?
- The Farm is a cult.

343
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:12,508
My mom is joining a cult,

344
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,927
and no one but me seems
to be worried about it.

345
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,429
- Betty...
- Just listen to me.

346
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:21,225
The only way to get real dirt on a cult
is to talk to a cult escapee.

347
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:24,854
So, I started Googling,
and I found all of these articles.

348
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,857
Dozens of stories about people
who have escaped.

349
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,066
The Farm?

350
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,320
I have a list of over 30 names,
all escapees.

351
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:35,114
- You have to help me call them.
- I can't help with this.

352
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,950
Why? Why not?

353
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:40,661
After what happened with Moose,
and him leaving town,

354
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:42,455
Evelyn started talking to me.

355
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,539
She helped me a lot.

356
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:46,584
She even said she'd introduce me
to some cute gay Farmies.

357
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:50,838
Kev, please, tell me you're not thinking
about actually joining the Farm.

358
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:51,756
What if I am?

359
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,050
Don't be so ready
to see the worst in people.

360
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,133
It isn't healthy.

361
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:02,975
Ghoulies. They're a drug club.
They can't be house-trained.

362
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,935
That's the Gargoyles, Dad.

363
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:08,773
The Ghoulies just need a strong leader.
Dad, I can be that.

364
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:11,692
But I'm going to need a carrot
that only you can provide.

365
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,903
It'd be easier
to get the Ghoulies to join us

366
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,697
if I could say we had immunity
from the law now that you're sheriff.

367
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:18,616
Your mom put you up to this?

368
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,077
Not even in town a week,
and she's making moves.

369
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,162
Coming to you with this ask was my idea.

370
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,706
It's risky,
but if we don't bolster our numbers,

371
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:27,332
we will go extinct.

372
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:31,337
As long as I don't have
to sign anything, yeah.

373
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,799
You tell them Sheriff Jones hasn't
forgotten where he's come from.

374
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:36,759
It'll be live and let live.

375
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:42,098
<i>Mi amor, </i>have you been in touch
with Governor Dooley lately?

376
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:45,184
He hasn't been returning my calls.

377
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,855
No, no, not since the quarantine.

378
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,858
I saw that you were putting out
our best bottles of rum.

379
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:55,403
Are you thinking
of having Donald over for drinks?

380
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:58,864
[chuckles] Oh, no,
those are for Gladys Jones.

381
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:01,200
Now that she's back in town,
I thought it may be prudent

382
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,577
for her and me to have a sit-down.

383
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,131
[Veronica] <i>We had a deal.</i>

384
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:19,802
I deliver payments
and morsels of information,

385
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,304
and you stay the hell away from my family.

386
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:26,934
Hey, your old man called me for a meeting.

387
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:31,188
If you breathe one word to him
about me or my mother,

388
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,497
I'll tell your son that you're hoping
to take over the drug trade.

389
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:35,525
Wow.

390
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:38,612
You're trying to shake me down. [chuckles]

391
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:40,239
That is awesome.

392
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,532
Look, I don't care.

393
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:44,076
Blab to him all you want.
He won't kill me for it.

394
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,830
Which I can't say the same
about what your father will do to his wife

395
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:48,998
if I spill the beans.

396
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,958
Watch it, Mrs. Jones.

397
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,127
Things could get messy for you.

398
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:56,964
I'm just taking care of business,
little lady.

399
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:04,513
And if my meeting with your father
doesn't go my way,

400
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:07,016
you better say an <i>Ave Maria</i> for Mommy.

401
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:14,440
Look, I can't do it.
I can't throw the fight. Here.

402
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:16,066
It's too late, Andrews.

403
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,193
We had an agreement.

404
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,196
You show up, you fight, you lose,
and everyone gets paid.

405
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,782
- I shouldn't have agreed. I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

406
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:27,870
Andrews, I don't just arrange fights.
I arrange bets on fights.

407
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,206
A lot of dangerous men put down
a lot of money

408
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,208
in anticipation of Ronson beating you.

409
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,919
You don't show up,
then they're gonna come after me.

410
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,587
And I'll send them after you.

411
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:40,257
And if you decide to try
and go rogue in the ring,

412
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:41,341
try and win, say,

413
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,761
Ronson will end you, right then and there.

414
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,430
Any deviation
from our agreement whatsoever

415
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:48,933
will end very, very badly for you.

416
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,184
See you on fight night.

417
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,505
[Jughead] <i>So, you're the last one.</i>

418
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:57,525
The last Ghoulie standing?
Where's the rest, Verne?

419
00:21:57,608 --> 00:21:59,735
After we lost Malachai, then Penny...

420
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,947
no one knew who to look to, who to follow.

421
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,032
So, most Ghoulies went to the Gargoyles,

422
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,283
started playing G&G.

423
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,537
Now that Tall Boy's dead,
who's their leader?

424
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,248
Closest thing to a leader
is a whack job named Kurtz,

425
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,666
who keeps the game going.

426
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:14,959
Do you know where he is?

427
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:16,877
Can you tell me where to go?

428
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:20,840
[loud rock music playing on speakers]

429
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,005
Are you Kurtz?

430
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:04,591
I'm here to talk.

431
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:07,177
One leader to another.

432
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:17,187
I'm the Serpent King,
and I'm here to make an offer.

433
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:20,441
You're all wanted for making
and dealing Fizzle Rocks.

434
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,943
But if you
and your Gargoyles join my gang,

435
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:26,864
I can promise you immunity
from the sheriff's office and the law.

436
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:28,489
Law.

437
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:31,410
Immunity.

438
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,663
I have looked into the eyes of the King.

439
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:36,831
And his...

440
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,585
is the only law.

441
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:42,296
The law of Gargoyles,

442
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:43,963
carved in stone.

443
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,840
Right.

444
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:47,927
So, you wanna play a game?

445
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,262
I'm a game master.

446
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,015
Let me be your game master.

447
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:57,811
You think Gryphons and Gargoyles...

448
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:00,856
is a game?

449
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,234
You are mistaken.

450
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,406
You come here as a king,
but you are not a king.

451
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:13,577
And you think we are playing a game.

452
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:16,914
But we are living...

453
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:18,957
a prophecy.

454
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:25,714
And you are all just sacrifices,
waiting to be made.

455
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,801
The Gargoyle King lives.

456
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:29,885
He will decide.

457
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,639
And he will choose.

458
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:40,688
And only the worthy will ascend.

459
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,155
Stick the jab.

460
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:54,117
Attaboy.

461
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:55,952
Mr. Keller.

462
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,371
You got a sec?

463
00:24:58,539 --> 00:24:59,707
What do you want, Arch?

464
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:06,087
You're right.

465
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:12,094
I thought this fight with Ronson would
help jumpstart something, anything.

466
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:15,389
But I'm not ready,
definitely not on my own.

467
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:19,685
And Elio paid me
to throw the fight with Ronson.

468
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:20,936
He did what?

469
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:24,440
I have no choice but to fight Ronson.
I'm worried he might kill me.

470
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,570
If I'm gonna stand any chance of survival,

471
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,155
I need you in my corner.

472
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:34,992
I've seen some tape on Ronson.

473
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,368
He's strong...

474
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,704
but he wasn't in the Army,

475
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,749
or didn't go through the meat grinder
of juvie like you did.

476
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,836
- You'll do what I say, Archie?
- Yes, sir. Everything.

477
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:50,758
All right. Let's go see what we can do
to make sure you don't get killed.

478
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:52,509
[Veronica] Excuse me.

479
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,052
Mind if I join you?

480
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,971
Hi, I'm Veronica Lodge.

481
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,057
You look familiar. Have we met before?

482
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,516
I don't believe we have.

483
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,268
You're Jughead's mom, right?

484
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:04,313
<i>Mija,</i> I was hoping
to have a private conversation.

485
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:07,691
Aw, what's the big deal? Let her join.

486
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:11,153
She's so gorgeous.
And you do trust her, don't you?

487
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,447
Yes, I do. I trust her very much.

488
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,740
So, we can speak freely?

489
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:16,741
Absolutely.

490
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,286
Okay, shall we?

491
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:23,081
[Gladys] So...

492
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:26,502
what is the point of this meeting?

493
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:27,753
Intimidation?

494
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:31,340
Word on the street is
that you're starting from scratch.

495
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,634
You really wanna go up against me?

496
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:35,051
[Gladys chuckles]

497
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:38,013
I'd pose the same question to you.
Here's my offer.

498
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:41,475
I focus on the candy trade,
you focus on the prison.

499
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:44,812
You stay out of my way,
and I stay out of yours.

500
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:45,895
Huh.

501
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,313
That's interesting.

502
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:50,734
My daughter made the same pitch.

503
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:52,528
But I'm afraid it isn't an option.

504
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:54,821
Well,

505
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:58,408
in that case, Hiram,
there is something you need to know.

506
00:26:58,867 --> 00:26:59,910
Daddy...

507
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,370
I've been thinking.

508
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:08,001
If you agree to this scenario,
I could get behind that.

509
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:09,919
Help you.

510
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:11,797
Just like you've always wanted.

511
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,677
It's what the family needs right now.

512
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:18,929
Everybody wins.

513
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:24,267
Okay.

514
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:27,479
I'll focus on my prison,
you'll run the streets.

515
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:31,525
But I need a steady stream of prisoners
to make this arrangement worth my while.

516
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:36,488
I guess your husband... [chuckles]
the sheriff, can help me with that.

517
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:38,282
Abso-freaking-lutely.

518
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:44,413
What about Madam Mayor?
Is she going to be a help or a hindrance?

519
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:46,290
I wouldn't worry about that.

520
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,584
She will not be a factor...

521
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:51,002
either way.

522
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:58,218
Hi, I read the interview you gave
to <i>The Buffalo Beat.</i>

523
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:00,429
Did you happen to be a member of the Farm?

524
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,724
[woman 1] <i>How'd you get this number?</i>
<i>I don't appreciate calls like this.</i>

525
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:06,310
Yes, I understand. I won't call again.

526
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:15,903
[phone ringing]

527
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:18,446
Hello?

528
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:20,782
[woman 2] <i>Yeah, did you call me,</i>
<i>and leave this number?</i>

529
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,326
Yes, yes. Um...

530
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:25,204
My name is Betty Cooper.

531
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,625
I have some questions for you
about the Farm.

532
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:34,129
<i>I can't say anything over the phone.
They might be listening.</i>

533
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:36,048
Will you meet me in person?

534
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:39,676
<i>It would need to be somewhere private,
away from prying eyes.</i>

535
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,931
I have the perfect spot.
How soon can you be in Riverdale?

536
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,989
[Elio] <i>Glad you decided to show, Archie.</i>

537
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,558
Wise man.

538
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:49,227
Yeah.

539
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:51,605
But I'm not taking the fall.

540
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:54,316
What are you trying to prove?

541
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,362
Go down in Round Three like we decided,
everyone walks out happy and in one piece.

542
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:06,953
Deal's off.

543
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:10,415
You heard the man.

544
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:12,333
Kill him.

545
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,593
How'd it go with the Ghoulies?

546
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:26,348
They don't exist anymore.
They're part of the Gargoyles now.

547
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,392
Same guys, different masks.
Did you recruit them?

548
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,644
No. I'll find another way
to save the Serpents.

549
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:34,773
Gargoyles aren't the answer.
I don't want them near us.

550
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:36,483
They, uh...

551
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,528
They're in so deep into G&G.

552
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:43,031
It's like they're lost in a jungle.

553
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:45,200
Take it easy, boy. Get some food in you.

554
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:48,287
[Betty] <i>Thank you</i>
<i>for meeting me so quickly, Martha.</i>

555
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:52,082
The Farm had places like this.
Secret places.

556
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:53,874
Hidey-holes.

557
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:55,877
When did you leave the Farm?

558
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:57,004
Six years ago.

559
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:01,383
My sister Marigold
and I joined at the same time.

560
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:03,093
I ran away.

561
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,555
I left The Farm right after she died.

562
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:08,515
I'm so sorry.

563
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,396
- How?
- Happened during one of their ceremonies.

564
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:17,566
What kind of ceremony?

565
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,986
The Farm believes
that if you can get close enough to death,

566
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,154
you'll see the truth.

567
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,865
They claim that you have
to survive an extreme ordeal

568
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,825
in order to achieve ascension.

569
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,076
What?

570
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,621
What do you mean, "ascension"?

571
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:32,956
The promise of the Farm.

572
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:37,044
And the first step towards it
is the baptism.

573
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:38,503
Baptism?

574
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:41,006
My sister drowned during hers.

575
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:42,923

576
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,136

00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:31,541
Oh, well, it's a win in my book.

686
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:39,424
Do you wanna maybe
go get a milkshake at Pop's?

687
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:40,507
To celebrate?

688
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,763
Unless you have a better idea.

The governor finally returned
my phone calls.

698
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,598
And we had
the most fascinating conversation.

699
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:31,267
What did Donald say?

700
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,103
It's funny.

701
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:40,026
He informed me
that you made a contribution to him...

702
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,946
not a day after I was shot.

703
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,280
Around the same time

704
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:47,408
that you were getting rid
of my business holdings.

705
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,746
Anything you'd like to share, <i>mi vida?</i>

706
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:55,416
- Daddy...
- Stop.

707
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,798
- Hiram...
- It was me.

708
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:07,262
I burned your drugs and equipment.

709
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:13,268
Mom was covering for me
with that story about the feds.

710
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,979
And I'm not going to apologize for it.

711
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:17,981
I did it for us.

712
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:20,358
For all of us.

713
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,198
Well...

714
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:30,243
you owe me $75,000, Veronica.

715
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:34,205
That's how much you burned away.

716
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:41,587
Fine.

717
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:44,382
I can live with that.

718
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,892
Gargoyles. Jellybean.

719
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:57,478
It's okay, kids. Stand down.

720
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:01,065
The hell is this? Are they here with you?

721
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:02,609
I did what you couldn't.

722
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:05,695
Ugh, take off those stupid masks.

723
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,161
This is a bad idea.

724
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:16,539
Sweetheart, sometimes,
beggars can't be choosers.

725
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,792
I know you guys will find a way
to work together.

726
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:23,129
We need all the manpower we can get
to take this town back.

727
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:24,964
Trust me.

728
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:28,217
God, she's not answering.

729
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:30,803
- Who isn't?
- This woman who escaped from the Farm.

730
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:34,849
I wanted her to tell you what she told me,
which is that they're dangerous, Mom.

731
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,897
I don't know what you remember, Mom.

732
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,525
But Polly held you underwater.

733
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:46,235
They didn't let you come up.

734
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,363
They tried to kill you, Mom.

735
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,489
No, Betty.

736
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,327
I was reborn.

737
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:58,414
I saw it all.

738
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:02,460
My purpose.

739
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,296
My destiny.

740
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:09,092
Just like the Farm promised.
Just like Edgar said.

741
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:13,846
Mom, no.

742
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,140
Now that I've been baptized,

743
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:19,894
I can finally purge the last thing
in my life that's been holding me back.

744
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,271
Which is what?

745
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:23,815
This house.

746
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:27,610
I'm gonna sell this house.

747
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:29,529
We're gonna all be together.

748
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:32,864
You...

749
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:34,574
me...

750
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,370
Polly, the twins...

751
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:41,457
Edgar, Evelyn, the Farm.

752
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:43,793
All one.

753
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,670
Together...

754
00:41:47,547 --> 00:41:49,382
forever and ever.
