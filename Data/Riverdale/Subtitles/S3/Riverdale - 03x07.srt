00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:11,344
-[narrator] <i>Previously on </i>Riverdale:
-So, my dad played G&amp;G in high school.

2
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:12,804
[Betty] All of our parents did.

3
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,348
-What's that, Hiram?
-Fizzle Rocks.

4
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:20,061
This house is no longer safe.
They'll watch over you now.

5
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:21,396
Mom, are you out of your mind?

6
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:23,898
[Woodhouse] You're safe
with the Sisters of Quiet Mercy.

7
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:28,695
Framing Archie for murder,
conspiring to keep him locked away.

8
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:31,156
An old-fashioned prison break
might be your best option.

9
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:33,908
[Jughead]
You're breaking Archie out of juvie?

10
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:37,162
[Minetta] <i>Ten thousand apiece.</i>
<i>You say that you saw Archie Andrews</i>

11
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,080
<i>kill your friend Cassidy Bullock.</i>

12
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:41,916
Your henchman, Minetta, is going down.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,046
If you added slots, table games,
you'd have quite the little gold mine.

14
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:49,257
[Archie] Hiram Lodge has done everything
in his power to destroy me.

15
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,884
I can't go back to Riverdale.

16
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:53,553
-I'm not letting you go off alone.
-I'm not alone.

17
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:55,430
Leaving is my best option, Jug.

18
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:00,143
[train horn blaring]

19
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:05,273
[Jughead] <i>The two young men</i>
<i>had been walking for days.</i>

20
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:07,525
<i>Looking at them...</i>

21
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,861
<i>you might think they were brothers.</i> <i>And in a way, they were.</i>

22
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:14,949
<i>Brothers fearful...</i>

23
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:19,037
<i>that Hiram Lodge might catch up to them.</i>

24
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:24,584
[Betty on recording]
<i>Hi, this is Betty. Leave a message.</i>

25
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,294
[Jughead] Hey. Betty, it's me.

26
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,171
Just trying you again.

27
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,340
Hoping you're okay.

28
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:34,010
We're looking for a place to settle down.
I'll let you know when we do. Okay.

29
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,595
Uh... I love you.

30
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:37,347
Bye.

31
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:39,390
Still no answer?

32
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,562
Look, Jug, maybe you should go back.

33
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:46,815
I'm fine.

34
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:50,110
Really, dude, I'm gonna be fine.

35
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:53,488
Archie, no offense, but Betty
took down a serial killer last year.

36
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,533
You can't go five minutes
without being kidnapped

37
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,243
or getting the crap kicked out of you.

38
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,662
That was before you were marked for death
by Hiram Lodge.

39
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,915
[Archie] It would be nice to stop looking
over my shoulder.

40
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:06,501
-Just find somewhere to settle, you know?
-We will.

41
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:10,255
When we find the right place,
we'll know. We'll feel it.

42
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:12,632
Or maybe we're already there.

43
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:21,516
Nice try. Let's go a couple more miles
before nightfall.

44
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,643
Come on. Jug, we gotta bunk somewhere.

45
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:44,038
[gun cocks]

46
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,374
[girl] You're trespassing.

47
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,669
Now let's see you do a little turn,
nice and slow.

48
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,311
Who are you?

49
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,479
I'm Cal. This is Biff.

50
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,231
From Centerville.

51
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:13,943
I don't like liars.

52
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,528
Shoot them, Gracie.

53
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:16,696
Wait. Wait.

54
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,198
We got robbed on a train.

55
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:21,242
They took all our money.
We've been walking for days. Just--

56
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:24,454
We need some food and water,
and we'll be on our way.

57
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,331
Put the rifle down.

58
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,374
-I don't trust them.
-Do as I say.

59
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,464
I'm Laurie Lake. This is Gracie.

60
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,383
You boys like stew? Where's everyone else?

61
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,315
I only meant...

62
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:55,401
A farm this size, I thought there'd
be more people working it.

63
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,780
A lot of the men in town are at a job,
down the river.

64
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:02,367
Our father and our brother went with them.
They come back now and then.

65
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,203
You have somewhere to stay?

66
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:06,496
-We're good.
-[Archie] No.

67
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,290
We should get out of your hair.

68
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,669
You could stay, if you sleep in the barn.

69
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,213
That's amazing.
Anything we can do to repay you?

70
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,340
-[clearing throat]
-Just some farm work.

71
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,551
I have some bales of hay I need to move.

72
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:23,179
Just stay out of the main house.

73
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,061
-Dude, we can't stay here.
-One night, Jug.

74
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:32,021
-What's the problem?
-I don't know.

75
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:34,565
Something about this place weirds me out.
It's...

76
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,943
a little too American Gothic, even for me.

77
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,446
You're right. Where is everybody?

78
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:44,701
When I asked what her dad and brother did,
it seemed like she was lying.

79
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,452
You mean like we are, Cal?

80
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,788
-[chuckles]
-[Laurie] Am I interrupting?

81
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:51,624
No. Not at all.

82
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:55,461
I brought some extra blankets,
in case you guys get cold.

83
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,548
Thank you, Laurie.

84
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:04,721
All right.

85
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,557
See you tomorrow.

86
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:09,851
Good night.

87
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,148
-Seriously?
-What?

88
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:18,526
We have to stay on task. No distractions.

89
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:21,612
I totally agree.

90
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,073
No distractions.

91
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,119
[rooster crowing]

92
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,624
Hey.

93
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,254
You missed eggs and bacon for breakfast.

94
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,341
Meanwhile,
you are literally moving bales of hay.

95
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:42,675
Yep.

96
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:44,969
Feel free to help out, too.

97
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:48,556
I'm going into town,
take some pictures before we hit the road.

98
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,475
Remember?

99
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,143
Like we said we would.

100
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,479
Gonna be okay here?

101
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,397
I think I'll be fine, Jug.

102
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:56,249
Excuse me.

103
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,005
Excuse me.

104
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:04,215
Hi.

105
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:08,219
I'm, uh... I'm a little lost.

106
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:15,852
I saw some strange symbols
on the sides of the buildings.

107
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,980
Didn't look as faded as the rest.
Know what they mean?

108
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,775
Town wasn't always like this.

109
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:28,072
First it was the jingle-jangle.
Now we're back to Fizzle Rocks.

110
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:29,949
Fizzle Rocks. Like the candy?

111
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,953
I used to eat that when I was a kid.

112
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,873
That's normal Fizzle Rocks.

113
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:42,003
What we got nowadays...
is laced with drugs.

114
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:46,757
As for them symbols,
they started showing up in town

115
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,969
about the same time
Fizzle Rocks trickled in.

116
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:54,182
You've done so much for me.
You don't have to do this, too.

117
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:55,725
I used to do this for my father.

118
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:59,520
-And you did move all that hay.
-My dad's a construction worker, so...

119
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,106
I'm used to physical labor.

120
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:06,110
Well, there's a lot of that around here.

121
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:07,820
[chuckles]

122
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,115
If you and your friend wanna stick around
for a few days.

123
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,077
I'm not sure about Cal, but...

124
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,914
I would be, I think.

125
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:23,211
There's something about this place
that just makes me feel at home.

126
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:24,962
I don't know why.

127
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,360
I'm sorry, Laurie.

128
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,988
I just-- I can't do this right now.

129
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,827
There's a girl back home.

130
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:00,456
There always is.

131
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,875
Though we're not together,
I still love her.

132
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,628
If you love her, Biff, why are you here?

133
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,509
Because of her father...

134
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:13,719
and my past with him.

135
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:20,434
Sometimes when you try to survive,
it's easy to lose sight of who you are.

136
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,317
Laurie, my name's not Biff.

137
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,321
It's Archie Andrews.

138
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:36,033
I'm from a small town called Riverdale,
which I can't go back to.

139
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,743
Because of your girl's father?

140
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,205
Hiram Lodge. Yes.

141
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,959
[sighs] I'm sorry I lied to you.

142
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:47,336
It's okay. Archie Andrews.

143
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,883
Around here,
everybody's running from something.

144
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:56,053
Let me see about getting you some lunch.

145
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:22,872
[girls giggling]

146
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,264
Are you a king?

147
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,892
I'm actually a Game Master.

148
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:46,228
-Started as a Hellcaster, like you.
-What level?

149
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:50,608
Almost three. On my way to four.
Where'd you learn to play?

150
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,653
Our older brothers used to play,
before they left town.

151
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,113
Yeah, I noticed that
there are no men here.

152
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,990
-All gone to work building a prison.
-Prison?

153
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,409
My brother told me
it's not just for prisoners.

154
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,328
It's for making Fizzle Rocks, too.

155
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,747
The prison doubles as a drug lab.

156
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,666
Where you shacking up, Game Master?

157
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:11,337
-Uh... Lake Farm.
-[Tiffany scoffs] Gracie's house?

158
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,924
-We used to be friends with her.
-Acts like she's too good for everybody, even though her daddy works
for the Man in Black like ours do.

159
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,389
-Who's the Man in Black?
-[Pearl] He's always in a black suit.

160
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,265
Gets driven around in a black car.

161
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,143
This town's his now.

162
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:28,145
Hiram.

163
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:36,195
I made you some more eggs.
I hope you don't mind.

164
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,198
No, that is more than okay. Thank you.

165
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,867
Don't thank me.
You helped me with the hay,

166
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,370
and helped me
pass the time a little bit quicker.

167
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,956
In my book, we're even.

168
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,044
These are delicious.

169
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,207
[inaudible dialogue]

170
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,014
Are you all right?

171
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,974
Let's get you out of here.

172
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,644
-Laurie knocked me out. Where is she?

00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:06,259
I'm not surprised.
As my father said, Elio is a criminal,

346
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,844
from a family of criminals.

347
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,013
Want me to rough him up? Throw him out?

348
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:13,141
No. That's not how we do things here.

349
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,477
Especially not to a member
of a crime family.

350
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,354
But don't worry.

351
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:20,524
Veronica Lodge is not about
to go quietly into the night.

352
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,778
-Dealer busts.
-Yes. Come on.

353
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:25,946
[crowd cheering]

354
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:30,617
Hey, Elio.

355
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:34,246
-Big night?
-I've never had such a run of luck.

356
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,957
Hope it doesn't put a huge dent
in your take.

357
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,251
You mean our take?

358
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:42,295
Well, seems like either way, I win.

359
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,801
Do yourself a favor.

360
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:49,636
Cash out.

361
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,347
And walk away while you still can.

362
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:53,807
Or what?

363
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:57,978
You'll call your father for backup?
I heard you weren't on speaking terms.

365
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:10,615
Deal me in.

366
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:13,034
What are you doing?

367
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,703
Raising the stakes.

368
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:18,790
One hand of blackjack, winner takes all.
Just you and me.

369
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,002
What am I playing for?

370
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,297
[Veronica] This.

371
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,340
The deed to Pop's.

372
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:29,843
And by extension,

373
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:31,803
La Bonne Nuit.

[crowd groans]

375
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:35,515
Fine. You asked for it.

376
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:37,392
Let's play.

Nineteen.

380
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:55,911
Tell you what.
You'll always be welcome at my speakeasy.

381
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,871
I might even re-name it "Veronica's."

382
00:24:58,413 --> 00:24:59,539
Game's not over yet.

383
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,167
[Elio] Trust me, princess. It's over.

384
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,503
Hit me.

385
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:12,761
Twenty-one.

[crowd cheering]

387
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:18,642
Ms. Lodge wins.

388
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,853
That, heh-- That's impossible.

389
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,105
Why, Elio?

390
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,525
The house always wins.

391
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:28,568
Isn't that what they say?

[chuckles]

394
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:43,291
You made some serious coin, Vee.

395
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:44,876
We did.

396
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,087
We're in the black, Reggie.

397
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:49,673
-It was a very successful night.
-Hmm.

398
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,342
Now, you could have lost it all, you know?

399
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,844
But you didn't. You pulled it off.

400
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,430
I swear, I thought Elio was cheating.

401
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,474
Can you keep a secret?

402
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:00,725
Mm-hm.

403
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:05,438
Couple of hours before we opened the doors
to Casino Night,

404
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,816
my father summoned me to his study.

405
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,276
What is it, Daddy?

406
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:12,737
You said you had some important news.
I'm on a bit of a time crunch.

407
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:16,449
Some business associates have informed me
that your friend Elio

408
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:19,411
has nefarious intentions
going into your Casino Night.

409
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,162
Something you're not aware of.

410
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,914
Like what?

411
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:26,626
He's planning on fleecing you,
because he thinks you're weak.

412
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,962
Because you're no longer
under my protection.

413
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:32,048
Okay.

414
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:33,883
Say I believe you.

415
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:35,927
What would you suggest I do?

416
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:38,263
[Hiram] <i>You beat him at his own game.</i>

417
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:41,224
<i>Like his father,</i>
<i>Elio is a compulsive gambler.</i>

418
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,643
<i>The bigger the pot,</i>
<i>the more he wants to stay in the game.</i> <i>The best way</i>

<i>with no remorse.</i>

422
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:57,240

<i>Now, I have a name</i>
<i>of a dealer you might wanna bring in:</i>

424
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,202
<i>Johnny Goldwater.</i>

425
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:03,496
<i>He has nimble fingers.</i>

427
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:08,918
[Goldwater] Twenty-one.

-[laughing]
-Wow.

429
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,925
-So, you scammed the scammer.
-Oh, Reginald.

430
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:20,388
It doesn't matter how you win,
so long as you're the last woman standing.

431
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,688
Was it a good night?

432
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:32,025
Yes. It was excellent.

433
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:35,987
You know, this place has been in my family
for generations.

434
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:38,531
It's a family place at heart.

435
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:40,283
Crime-free.

436
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:42,494
[sighs]

437
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,204
Pop.

438
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:49,292
The speakeasy wasn't making enough money,
and neither was the diner,

439
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,086
so, I had to take a big swing.

440
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,421
Bend the rules a bit.

441
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:54,631
Please.

442
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:59,052
For your own sake, Veronica,
don't be like your father.

443
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,012
Pop, deep, deep down...

444
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,224
maybe my dad's not so bad.

445
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:05,975
You haven't heard the news yet?

446
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:10,563
Sheriff Minetta's body was found
in the marsh last night.

447
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,191
At least they think it was his body.

448
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:17,278
They don't know for sure,
because it was decapitated.

449
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:20,115
And the hands were sawed off.

450
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:30,417
[Betty] <i>Make them think that you're sane.</i>

451

00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,882
[Betty] <i>A dead body, you idiot.</i>

453
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,384
I see a toy.

454
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:41,469
A teddy bear with a bowtie.

455

<i>Just pass this test,</i>
<i>and then you can start investigating.</i>

[Woodhouse] What do you see now?

457
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:51,980
[Betty] <i>The Black Hood.</i>

458
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:54,023
A butterfly.

459
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,151
A monarch butterfly.

460
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,110
Hmm.

461
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:03,575
And now?

462
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:08,079
[Betty] <i>Remember to smile, Betty,</i>
<i>and you'll be out of here in no time.</i>

463
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:11,916
The old jungle gym
at Riverdale Elementary.

464
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,836
I used to play on it every recess.

465
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:18,715
Very interesting.

466
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:20,884
Step forward, Nellie.

467
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:22,510
It's time for your candy.

468
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:25,096
[Betty] <i>My mom and her delusions.</i>

<i>She has a fondness for this place.</i>

470
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:31,269
<i>She thought the Sisters would keep me safe</i>
<i>from the Gargoyle King.</i>

471
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,521
<i>She probably didn't realize</i>

472
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,733
<i>that she was sending me</i>
<i>right into the belly of the beast.</i>

473
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,904
-What is this?
-A treat.

474
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:43,323
Every patient gets candy

What are you doing here?

485
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:24,823
Sister Woodhouse thought you might benefit

486
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:27,116
from having a roommate
who's familiar with the system.

487
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,327
[Betty] <i>What a nightmare.</i>

488
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:30,703
Fun.

489
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:35,208
Uh... Did you just come from art class?

490
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:37,335
[Ethel] Oh, no. That's my warrior board.

491
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:39,629
It's like a visual collection
of my destiny.

492
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:41,256
It helps me manifest my goals.

493
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,466
[Betty] <i>If I didn't already</i>
<i>have an escape plan,</i>

<i>As soon as I have what I need,</i>

496
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:49,430
<i>I'll find the door marked X</i>
<i>in the basement</i>

497

<i>that Veronica used</i>
<i>when they broke Cheryl out.</i>

498
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:52,809
Isn't the King marvelous?

499
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:56,354
Since I came here,
I've had wonderful conversations with him.

500
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:59,190
Wait, what are you saying?

501
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:02,110
That you've been talking
to the Gargoyle King in person?

502
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:05,238
-Yes. We've become very close.
-Really?

503
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,827
Think you could introduce us?

504
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:13,329
No. That's Sister Woodhouse's job.

505
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:14,914
What is?

506
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,876
The Sisters take patients
into the Gargoyle King's chamber

507
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,002
when they misbehave.

508
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,546
Other girls are scared of him,
but I'm not.

509
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:24,591
Where's his chamber?

510
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:27,302
I can't tell you.
That's Sister Woodhouse's job.

511
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,599
Hmm. You'd tell Jughead.

512
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:36,769
About Jughead...

513
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:41,608
I wasn't going to mention this,
but since you brought him up...

514
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:44,861
Betty.

515
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,739
I don't think Jughead's into you anymore.

516
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:51,534
We connected
when we played the game together,

517
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:54,829
and things got pretty hot and heavy
in the bunker.

518
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,956
[Betty] <i>This psycho bitch.</i>

519
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:01,794
Oh, he definitely told me about
how you blackmailed him into kissing you.

520
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:06,799
I knew you would do this.

521
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:09,385
You always acted
like you're better than me.

522
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:12,305
-You and all your shallow friends.
-What are you talking about?

523
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:14,057
This isn't Riverdale High.

524
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:15,767
Rules are different here.

525
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,311
I'm the queen bee, not you, Betty Cooper.

526
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:21,105
And if you wanna get better,
change your attitude.

527
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:24,317
And you have to be honest with yourself,
and with others.

528
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,112
And you can start
with what you threw into the trash.

529
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:35,995
Ethel, I'm sorry.

530
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,999
I want to be your friend,
if you'll have me.

531
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,961
Can you just not tell anyone
about the candy?

532
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:46,047
Can you just keep it between us, please?

533
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:48,216
Roomie.

534
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:51,844
Okay, Betty.

535
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,263
I'll keep it our little secret.

536
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,975
But you really should take the candy.

537
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,310
It's super delicious.

538
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:03,564
[Agnes] <i>Be careful of the thorns, girls.</i>

539
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,443
Very good, my child.

540
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:11,489
[Betty] <i>That's funny.</i>

541
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:15,118
<i>The Sisters don't serve maple syrup</i>
<i>in the cafeteria.</i>

542
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:19,372
<i>And why would Claudius Blossom</i>
<i>be making the delivery?</i>

543
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,001
<i>What the hell?</i>

544
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:35,096
<i>What kind of business does Hiram Lodge</i>
<i>have with Sister Woodhouse,</i>

545
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,306
<i>and how are the Blossoms connected to it?</i>

546
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:42,562
Hey. Do you know who that is?

547
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,065
They call him the Man in Black.

548
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,275
He's an angel donor.

549
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,861
Helps the sisters
with anything they may need.

550
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,571
Isn't that nice of him?

551
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:53,114
Yeah. Amazing.

552
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,158
<i>Wait a minute. According to my mom,</i>

553
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:57,618
<i>Hiram was the one</i>
<i>who brought the Fizzle Rocks</i>

554
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,662
<i>to Ascension Night all those years ago.</i>

555
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:02,206
Back to it, Betty.
Idle hands make the devil's work.

556
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:04,876
[Betty] <i>Bite me.</i>

557
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:10,423
<i>What did Hiram give the Sisters?</i>
<i>And what did Woodhouse give him?</i>

558
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:14,135
<i>Maybe there's a clue</i>
<i>in those files they're keeping.</i>

559
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:17,388
<i>If I can just find the right office</i>
<i>or a records room...</i>

560
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:25,772
<i>Wait, this must be the Gargoyle King's</i>
<i>chamber Ethel was talking about.</i>

561
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:37,075
[girl screaming]

562
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,787
[girl grunting and whimpering]

563
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,713
[girl sobbing]

564
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:53,466
Hush. Hush, child. Hush.

565
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,369
[Ethel] What do you think you're doing?

566
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:23,496
This area is off-limits.

567
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:24,580
Ethel, I...

568
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:27,834
Know where the medical archives are?

569
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:31,712
Sister Agnes sent me to fetch some files.
I got kind of lost.

570
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:35,883
Silly Betty. Only the infirm are allowed
in the infirmary.

571
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,512
Time to go back to our room now.

572
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:40,805
While I'm watching.

573
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:41,973
Okay.

574
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:53,025
<i>Acting normal. This me acting normal.</i>

575
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,319
<i>All I need is a pen,</i>

576
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:58,656
<i>a bobby pin that hasn't</i>
<i>been dulled down, or--</i>

577
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:00,575
<i>A paperclip.</i>

578
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:01,492
<i>Bingo.</i>

579
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,252
Hey, Betty, come play with us.

580
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:15,339
Uh, no, thanks, Ethel.

581
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,300
Betty, you said we were friends.

582
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,760
And friends play together.

583
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:23,389
[Betty] <i>This isn't how I imagined myself</i>
<i>getting to those medical files,</i>

584
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:27,268
<i>but since only the infirm</i>
<i>go to the infirmary...</i>

585
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,147
You wanna be real friends, Ethel?

586
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:34,692
Hmm. That's weird,

587
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:37,987
because real friends
don't kiss each other's boyfriends.

588
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:44,285
That's because the Gargoyle King
wants Jughead and me to be together.

589
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,037
-Oh, yeah?
-We're gonna be a ship.

590
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:48,039
Oh.

591
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:49,832
Ethelhead?

592
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:53,419
In your dreams.

593
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:54,462
[chuckles]

594
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:55,838
You're just jealous.

595
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,799
Jealous that Jughead and I are worthy,
and you're not, but here's the thing, Betty, okay?

596
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,887
You're never going to be worthy.

597
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,181
And the Gargoyle King?
You'll never meet him.

598
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:06,724
[Betty] <i>Here we go.</i>

599
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:13,272
Sister Woodhouse, she's having a seizure.

600
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:15,691
Ethel, get the nurse.

601
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:18,277
[Betty] <i>Yes, Ethel, get the nurse.</i>

602
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:21,280
<i>And God willing,</i>
<i>she'll take me exactly where I need to go.</i>

603
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:24,033
There, there, Elizabeth.
You're going to be all right.

604
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,410
We'll get you to the infirmary.

605
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,790
[Betty] <i>Well, they bought it.</i>

606
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:33,417
<i>They actually believe I had a seizure.</i>

607
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,963
Let's re-evaluate her dosage
as soon as possible.

608
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,297
Yes, Sister Woodhouse.

609
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,526
[Betty] <i>Jackpot. There you are.</i>

610
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:13,124
<i>Elizabeth Cooper.</i>

611
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:21,424
<i>"Two doses of Bullio Lapis, mornings only.</i>

612
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:22,633
<i>Sporadic seizures.</i>

613
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:25,386
<i>Patient seems to be responding well</i>
<i>to testing.</i>

614
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:28,848
<i>Per HL, increase dosage after first week."</i>

615
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,017
<i>HL?</i>

616
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,228
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

617
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:37,690
<i>Is Hiram Lodge using patients</i>
<i>at the Sisters as lab rats?</i>

618
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:40,693
<i>And what is Bullio Lapis? Unless...</i>

619
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,528
Fizzle Rocks.

620
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:43,612
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

621
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,281
<i>Okay, now that I have my proof,</i>

622
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:47,408
<i>it's officially time</i>
<i>to get the hell out of here.</i>

623
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,911
<i>The door to escape is in the basement.</i>

624
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:59,420
<i>X marks the spot. Just like Veronica said.</i>

625
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,880
<i>I'm so out of here.</i>

626
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:06,427
No.

627
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,725
No.

628
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,438
[Ethel] There she is.

629
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:20,107
Ethel.

630
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:21,901
Sister Woodhouse.

631
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,487
I just-- I got lost again.

632
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:27,073
I told you she was up to no good,
Sister Woodhouse.

633
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:29,909
Restrain her.

634
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:31,869
No.

635
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:33,913
No.

636
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:35,831
[grunts]

637
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,835
What are you doing, Sister Woodhouse?

638
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:43,672
You've been a very bad girl, Betty.

639
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,258
You haven't been taking your candy.

640
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:49,678
Ethel.

641
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:52,556
-Steady her.
-No.

642
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,143
[grunting]

643
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:03,526
My King. My Savior.

644
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:05,403
Guide me through the night.

645
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:08,364
Bless me with your darkness,
gift me with your flight.

646
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:12,159
She needs a good, strong talking-to
from the King, I think.

647
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:23,212
I was wrong. You are gonna meet the King.

648
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:43,607
No.

649
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,204
The King awaits you.

650
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,551
[Betty screaming]

651
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:17,224
Now let's try this again, shall we?

652
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:22,771
Tell me what you see, Betty.

653
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:25,774
A dead body.

654
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:30,696
What do you see now?

655
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:31,947
The Black Hood.

656
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:38,287
And now?

657
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,752
The Gargoyle King.

658
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,796
Wonderful, wonderful work.

659
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:49,757
You've already made progress.

660
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:52,259
[Betty] <i>My King. My Savior.</i>

661
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:54,011
<i>Guide me through the night.</i>
