[narrator] <i>Previously on</i> Riverdale:

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,638
-What are you doing?
-What we did all summer.

3
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:14,806
[Moose] My dad is right over there.

4
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:15,849
Why?

5
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:18,268
He's the new RROTC instructor.

6
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,854
-Welcome, cadets.
-Excuse me, Major Mason.

7
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:22,523
Hope it's not too late to join.

8
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:24,691
Can I get another bartender in here?

9
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:27,069
Toby. Toby. I know him.

10
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:28,737
Listen, Andrews.

11
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,323
You are in freefall,
and I am not having it.

12
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,325
You broke the code.
Turn in your jackets and go.

13
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:34,409
[Toni] You serious, Jones?

14
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:37,454
I'm a Serpent by blood.
You can't take that away from me.

15
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:40,582
[Veronica] I think my mom may have
hired someone to shoot my father,

16
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:43,502
so she could profit
from the sale of his drug operation.

17
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:46,255
We're gonna destroy them
before my mom sells everything.

18
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:47,381
[Hermione] What did you do?

19
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:50,342
My buyer is coming, Veronica.
They are gonna want blood.

20
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,432
[Jughead] <i>Riverdale is like Bizarro Town.</i>

21
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,686
<i>Where murder, mystery,</i>
<i>and candy drugs aren't the exception,</i>

22
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:01,770
<i>they're the norm.</i>

23
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:04,064
<i>And you forget, sometimes,</i>

24
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,400
<i>that people are still</i>
<i>just living their lives.</i>

25
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:09,611
<i>Doing things as ordinary</i>
<i>as getting married.</i>

26
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,071
You don't want a big wedding?

27
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,240
We just finalized our divorces, Kevin.

28
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,701
And this is the second marriage
for both of us.

29
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,536
With everything that's going on
in Riverdale--

30
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:20,289
We just wanna go down to Town Hall
and keep it simple.

31
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,541
If I may.

32
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,626
We fully disagree.

33
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:28,880
But we're not the ones getting married,
so, we respect your decision,

34
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,843
as long as you let us throw you
an after-party at La Bonne Nuit.

35
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:34,136
Ah.

36
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:37,097
If there's no wedding reception,
the Gargoyle King has won.

37
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,019
Okay, but a small one.

38
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,354
Fabulous, I'll send out invites today.

39
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,107
-Marcus.
-Tom.

40
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:49,234
Cadet Keller, ladies.

41
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:51,653
-How are you all doing?
-We're good, thank you.

42
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:53,697
Actually, we've got some news.

43
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:56,283
Tom and I are finally tying the knot,

44
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:59,745
and these two are throwing us
an after-party downstairs.

45
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:02,789
You and Moose can be our first invites.
How about it?

46
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:06,460
I'll... check my calendar, Sierra.

47
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:12,799
What's his deal?

48
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:15,552
Marcus and I used to be good friends.

49
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:19,556
We did RROTC together,
but we just grew apart.

50
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,351
It's probably the jealousy.

51
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:23,268
Well...

52
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,896
Marcus always had a crush on me,
as you know.

53
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,231
-[chuckles]
-But I only had eyes for you.

54
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:29,316
Lucky me.

55
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:32,444
Mm.

56
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:35,364
Feels so good to sleep
in a real bed, doesn't it?

57
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:38,492
Far away from the rural horrors
of Tent City?

58
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,787
Well, I don't miss the cold or the mud,
that's true.

59
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,704
But...

60
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,331
I don't know.

61
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,249
I miss the gang, babe.

62
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,085
[cell phones beeping]

63
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:49,503
[Cheryl sighs]

64
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,714
Oh, my God, our SAT scores.

65
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:55,926
I pray mine are good enough
for Highsmith College.

66
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:58,387
Women of my family have gone there
for generations.

67
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,597
I don't intend to break Blossom tradition.

68
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:10,107
Much like <i>Desert Hearts,</i>
my score's not perfect, but it's close.

69
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:11,566
How'd you fare, Tee-Tee?

70
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,905
Flawless, as I've always known you to be.

71
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:18,740
[chuckles]

72
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:23,286
[Hermione] Since you two vigilantes
took it upon yourselves

73
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,206
to burn all the Fizzle Rocks
that I had already sold,

74
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:29,501
you are gonna come up with the money
to pay back what's owed.

75
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:34,464
-How do we do that?
-I'd start with the speakeasy's coffers.

76
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,594
We don't make nearly enough to pay off
whatever kingpin you're working with, Mom.

77
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:41,972
Well, then I suggest you get creative,
<i>mija.</i>

78
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,098
And quickly.

79
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:46,351
The buyer who has a reputation
for being dangerously unhinged

80
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:47,978
is on their way to Riverdale,

81
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:51,648
and looking to get paid back in full
for the drugs they are not getting.

82
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:55,068
Who is this buyer?

83
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:57,654
You don't need to know.
They're sending an intermediary.

84
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:01,241
How much money are we talking about,
Mrs. Lodge?

85
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,335
And suddenly, I'm in an episode of <i>Ozark.</i>

86
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,046
No, but you are in the big leagues now,

87
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,424
and it is time to sink or swim.

88
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,972
[Cheryl] Furthermore,
I've successfully balanced my duties

89
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:27,434
as captain of the River Vixens
and president of the student body,

90
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,061
whilst maintaining a 4.2 GPA,
perfect attendance,

91
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:32,439
and achieving an almost perfect SAT store.

92
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:33,982
For these reasons,

93
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,526
I'm an exemplary candidate
for Highsmith College.

94
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,695
Not to mention, I'm legacy.

95
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,363
You are, Ms. Blossom.

96
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:44,534
However, most recently,
Highsmith College's Board of Directors

97
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:48,580
have decided it's time
to diversify our student body

98
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:52,375
with women from outside the alumni pool.

99
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:56,087
This is a new initiative?

100
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,924
I'm afraid so.
But long overdue, don't you agree?

101
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,009
Oh. Absolutely.

102
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,971
I'm just imagining which board member
suddenly developed a conscience.

103
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:13,271
Hey. I need to ask you something. Hey.

104
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,234
-Will you be my date to my dad's wedding?
-Kevin--

105
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,986
It's a public event.
You haven't come out to your dad.

106
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,031
But maybe it's time.
I mean, how long have we been together?

107
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,575
-Since summer started.
-So, forever.

108
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:29,913
And I love a clandestine grope
as much as the next gay guy,

109
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:31,957
but we've never spent a night together.

110
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,418
-You don't think I want to?
-So do it. Just talk to your dad.

111
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,922
-Dad.
-Major Mason.

112
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:42,509
-Told you they were in here, sir.
-Cadet Mason, Cadet Keller.

113
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:45,971
The meeting with the Naval Academy
recruitment officer is about to start.

114
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,764
So, on the double.

115
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,644
Sorry, Kev. I can't.

116
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:57,399
[sighs]

117
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,320
[Josie] Hey, Sweet Pea.

118
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:04,739
Hope you don't mind me dropping by.

119
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,408
Always happy to see you, Josie.

120
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,577
Especially if this is a...

121
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:10,787
A booty call?

122
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:13,874
Wouldn't be our first one
since our summer fling ended.

123
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,210
Well, it's not.

124
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:18,795
Um...

125
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:22,215
I don't know if you've heard,
but my mom is getting married.

126
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:23,675
To Kevin's dad.

127
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:27,387
And I wanted to know
if you would be my date to the wedding.

128
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,389
As your boyfriend?

129
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,517
Does it have to be so official?

130
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:33,602
[chuckles]

131
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:35,562
Look, Josie...

132
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:37,272
I like you.

133
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,317
I'd be all in with you in a second, but...

134
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,738
But you sliding into my life
whenever you don't wanna be alone...

135
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:46,698
I'm not built that way.

136
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,035
Maybe that makes me needy, but I just...

137
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,497
I gotta get off
this merry-go-round with you.

138
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,918
[jazz music playing]

139
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,634
So, this is the infamous Maple Club.

140
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,095
And no surprise,
it's as cheap and callow as your efforts

141
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,348
to sabotage my admission
to your alma mater.

142
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:15,352
I spoke to the headmistress
at Highsmith College.

143
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:17,520
She enlightened me about a new policy

144
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,523
that seems designed specifically
to keep me from attending.

145
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,401
I can't think of anyone else
who would stoop so low, Mumzie.

146
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:24,611
Care to explain?

147
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,237
Oh, Cheryl.

148
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:29,699
The hallowed halls of Highsmith
shall not be polluted

149
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:33,036
by someone of your... alignment.

150
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,538
You are an aberration.

151
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,124
I'm so sure the alumni newsletter
would be thrilled

152
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:41,544
to profile a twice-widowed dominatrix
with a proclivity for poison.

153
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:44,714
With the financial gifts
I bestowed upon them over the years,

154
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,299
I doubt they would bat an eye.

155
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,010
Now, accept it, Cheryl.

156
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,929
This is the price of salt.

157
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:54,391
Your presence
shall not besmirch Highsmith.

158
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,437
[chuckles]

159
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,273
The charges against you are very serious.

160
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,359
Oh, well, what do you suggest?

161
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,486
I could request an injunction.

162
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,280
[chuckles] I think
I'd like to go straight to trial.

163
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:10,615
[both laughing]

164
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:13,868
Where are you going?

165
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:17,706
I am having a little snack
before having my other snack.

166
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:18,707
[laughs]

167
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:25,380
What is it?

168
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:37,684
"Fair Sierriana,

169
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,519
Friar Thomas,

170
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,565
congratulations on your upcoming nuptials.

171
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,901
If you wish to live
to see this blessed event,

172
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,612
you must reunite
with your Midnight Club to co--

173
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:53,575
To complete Ascension Night,
once and for all."

174
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,871
"Tell no one,

175
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,498
or your children will pay the price.

176
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,417
Best wishes...

177
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:04,919
the Gargoyle King."

178
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:22,312
Well, someone looks like
they could use an epaulet to cry on.

179
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,398
I'm not trying to carb-shame you,

180
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,817
but whatever's on your mind,
it's not worth it.

181
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,528
So, put down the Swizzler,

182
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,489
and tell me your tale of woe.

183
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:34,199
I could use the distraction.

184
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:35,992
Well...

185
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,203
there's this guy.

186
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,871
And we've been having problems.

187
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,039
Moose, you mean?

188
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,541
Please. I have eyes.

189
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,627
I saw you lounging together
at my pool party,

190
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,129
like a community theater production
of <i>The Talented Mr. Ripley.</i>

191
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,632
The Koose ship's been trouble
from the gay get-go.

192
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,051
Maybe it's time you move on.

193
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:55,178
I can't go back to Fox Forest.

194
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,430
Oh, sullen, tender-hearted Kevin.

195
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,225
I'm not talking about cruising.

196
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,644
I'm talking about Bumble.

197
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,272
Look.

198
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:11,402
I'm sure you can find a well-adjusted,
handsome, out-and-proud fella here.

199
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,613
That'd be nice.

200
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,782
But I like Moose a lot.

201
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:20,578
I just wish he'd be honest with his dad,
so we could date, you know, openly.

202
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:21,621
What's his hang-up?

203
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:25,500
Major Mason's not the biggest fan
of our persuasion.

204
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,795
It burns me that there are people
in this town that still believe

205
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,923
that being gay is anything less
than rapturous.

206
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,595
Maybe Moose would come out
if he liked me more.

207
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,306
No. It's not your fault, Kevin.

208
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:43,059
Your aesthetic may be firmly rooted
in the 1950s,

209
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,186
but you're a catch in any decade.

210
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,272
As for the object of your affection,

211
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:51,526
maybe he just needs
the subtlest of nudges.

212
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:55,196
A bulldozer wouldn't be enough.

213
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:59,784
Attention, students,
it's time for the daily announcements.

214
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:03,204
As Riverdale High's first openly lesbian
student body president,

215
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:07,709
<i>I'm announcing the launch of a new club.</i>
<i>An LGBTQIA alliance.</i>

216
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:11,421
<i>With the mission to find and support</i>
<i>our queer and questioning students.</i>

217
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:15,008
In that spirit,
this week's blind item will be on theme.

218
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:20,180
A certain oh-so-hunky,
all-American RROTC cadet is afraid

219
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:21,598
to come out of the closet.

220
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,019
Let's show him
that Riverdale High is welcoming,

221
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,688
so he and his Broadway-loving boyfriend
can finally PDA,

222
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:31,232
like the other sex-crazed couples
amongst us.

223
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,862
For lunch today,
we're having shepherd's pie. Thank you.

224
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:42,785
-[Moose] Did you put Cheryl up to that?
-What, her not-so-blind item?

225
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:43,870
Of course not.

226
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:47,957
I'm opposed to publicly outing people,
except conservative politicians.

227
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,500
Have people guessed it's you?

228
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,044
No.

229
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:53,171
I don't know, maybe.

230
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,464
Moose...

231
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:58,968
Putting aside what Cheryl did,
we've been together for a while now.

232
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:02,055
I can't keep playing Brokeback Riverdale
with someone who's in the closet.

233
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,682
Either you come out to your dad,

234
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:07,185
or, I'm sorry, but we're breaking up.

235
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:10,772
Either way, I respect your decision.

236
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,369
-What the hell were you thinking?
-Just now?

237
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,663
About the sweet revenge
I'll get on Mumzie.

238
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:30,333
Hopefully with help from you,
and your camera, shutterbug of my dreams.

239
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,585
-You just outed Moose.
-No, I didn't.

240
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:36,506
It was a blind item, Toni.
No one knows I was referring to him.

241
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,758
Moose's father could've heard
that announcement.

242
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:42,220
-Oh, my God. Is this our first fight?
-Cheryl, get some perspective.

243
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:46,349
Did you know that my uncle hated the fact
that I dated girls?

244
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,519
That's why the Serpents
were so important to me.

245
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:54,107
They were like my non-judgmental family.

246
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,068
Now I don't have them.

247
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,029
Toni, I'm sorry.

248
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:01,739
I didn't realize.

249
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,949
Of course you didn't.

250
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,326
Because you're too busy being Cheryl,

251
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,870
causing chaos,
regardless of the consequences.

252
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:08,913
Look, babe.

253
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:13,209
I get that you're mad at your mom,
and you're pissed that you're not going

254
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,962
to some college
that I could never get into or afford.

255
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,548
-If it's about money--
-Just stop and listen to me.

256
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,469
Highsmith College was your legacy.

257
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,681
The Serpents were mine.

258
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,268
Now they're not.

259
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,187
Toni, I'll...

260
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,148
I'll fix this.

261
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:36,774
What part?

262
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,318
All of it.

263
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,530
You are the most important person
in my life.

264
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:47,368
I'll do whatever it takes
to make all these things right.

265
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:50,705
But I may need your help.

266
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:03,760
Josie. Hey.

267
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,094
Archie, hey.

268
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,262
Am I interrupting?

269
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:08,598
I was just practicing.

270
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:12,769
There is a recruiter from Juilliard
holding local auditions,

271
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,687
and my slot's this afternoon.

272
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,190
Don't be nervous. You're gonna kill it.

273
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,359
[laughs] If I could even get there.

274
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,736
It's at Seaside,

275
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,989
and I just assumed
that Sweet Pea would give me a ride,

276
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:27,533
but I didn't even get a chance to ask him.

277
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:29,452
Sweet Pea?

278
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,538
-Wait, are you guys--?
-No.

279
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:35,041
I ended it,
so that I could focus on my music,

280
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,043
which is what I always do.

281
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,586
Stay focused.

282
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,340
So much so that I've pushed everyone away.

283
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,926
And I can't ask my mom for a ride,

284
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,553
she doesn't even know
that I have this audition.

285
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,223
Because if she knew,
and I didn't do well at it,

286
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,558
she'd start asking me
about my backup plans,

287
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:53,684
which I don't have.

288
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,232
Let me take you.

289
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,067
I got the jalopy.

290
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,277
Really?

291
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:04,487
Absolutely.

292
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,406
Just remember this moment,

293
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:09,200
when you're accepting
your Best New Artist Grammy.

294
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,118
Okay?

295
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,577
Okay.

296
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,125
[Reggie] What's up, Ronnie?

297
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,334
We're dead.

298
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,877
We're officially dead.

299
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:22,380
That or we're about
to have our kneecaps broken.

300
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,799
Courtesy of whoever this mystery buyer is.

301
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,551
Does that really happen?

302
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:30,721
I've combined my liquid funds
from Pop's and La Bonne Nuit.

303
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:33,015
We're not even a quarter of the way there.

304
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:35,184
Is robbing banks still a thing?

305
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:38,938
Although the thought of being Bonnie
to your Clyde is intriguing...

306
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,026
banks have round-the-clock
security guards with guns.

307
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,321
But if they're anything
like my dad's lame-ass security guards...

308
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,739
[sighs]

309
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,827
Holy crap, I'm a genius.

310
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,163
My dad keeps cash
in a safe at the dealership.

311
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:56,914
Enough to make up the difference.

312
00:15:56,998 --> 00:16:00,001
I'm not gonna let you steal
from your own family.

313
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,712
That dealership is my legacy,
so, technically,

314
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,672
I'd borrow money from my future self.

315
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:08,634
And everything's insured,
so, my dad will get a sweet payout,

316
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:12,221
more than he deserves for all the shiners
he's given me over the years.

317
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:17,393
This is lunacy.

318
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:23,274
But it might be inspired lunacy.

319
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,863
-How would we get it all done?
-My dad's security guard

320
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,907
is only on duty at night after closing,

321
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:35,369
so, I'd hit the lot during the day,
probably lunchtime,

322
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:39,457
when my dad is usually at Pop's,
with a customer,

323
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,293
trying to close a sale.

324
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,337
You could wear a Gargoyle mask,

325
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,838
so as not to get recognized.

326
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:48,382
And I, of course, would come with you,

327
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,843
as we're in this mess together.

328
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:53,429
You can be my <i>Baby Driver.</i>

329
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,933
Just, please, don't scratch my car.

330
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:58,309
Okay?

331
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,237
So, we all received letters,

332
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,821
to finish Ascension Night.

333
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:13,866
-This was taped to my trailer.
-Mine came to the dealership.

334
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,035
Thought you caught the Gargoyle King, FP.

335
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:19,330
Tall Boy was using the game
as a cover to deal drugs,

336
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:23,167
but he wasn't the one setting up chalices
back when we were in high school.

337
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,922
We're not really taking this seriously,
are we?

338
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:31,092
We have to assume this is real,
if only for our kids' sake.

339
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,886
And then what?
We leave them home alone all night,

340
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,430
while we run around,
pretending to be teenagers?

341
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:39,183
May I remind you
what happened last Ascension Night?

342
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,768
Someone ended up dead.

343
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:43,563
We don't have any choice in the matter.

344
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,940
We all know why this is happening again,

345
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,024
and now.

346
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:52,071
Two members of the original Midnight Club
are daring to get married,

347
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:53,698
to be happy.

348
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,867
And the Gargoyle King,
whoever or whatever he is,

349
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:59,078
wants to destroy that.

350
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,789
He is a vicious and petty god.

351
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,749
And if we don't finish the game now,

352
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:07,211
the Gargoyle King is
never gonna leave us alone.

353
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:09,714
Maybe if we do this,
we catch the son of a bitch.

354
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,048
There's only one problem.

355
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:14,844
The letter says
we all have to participate.

356
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,472
I'll talk to Hiram.

357
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:21,601
All right, it's settled, then.
We finish the game we started.

358
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:39,619
[woman] Name?

359
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:41,787
Josephine McCoy.

360
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,249
All right, then.

361
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,501
Whenever you're ready.

362
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,353
[gunshots]

363
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:16,697
Go, go, go.

364
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,243
Oh, my God, Reggie.

365
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:22,495
-Were you shot?
-Yeah.

366
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,623
I got the money,
but there was security after all.

367
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,416
-Well, are you okay?
-Drive, drive.

368
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:36,467
-[Cheryl] Thanks for your help, Toni.
-Just remember your promise to me.

369
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:40,012
Don't worry, babe. I have a mega-plan,
and this is only step one.

370
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,102
Operation Fifty Shades of Blackmail
is underway.

371
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,402
What in God's name
are you jezebels doing here?

372
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,825
Whatever mad, sapphic caper you're on,

373
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,828
I won't have you jeopardize
my thriving business.

374
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:08,290
Step down from the Highsmith College Board
and revoke your ban on my admittance,

375
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:11,335
or I'll go public with these photos
of your sorry clientele.

376
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:16,173
I am far from ashamed of my work, Cheryl.

377
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:21,262
Need I remind you
that blackmail is far more illegal

378
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,556
than anything that goes on
at the Maple Club,

379
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:25,474
all of which is consensual.

380
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,309
[Toni] How will your clients feel,

381
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,562
once we publish their names and photos?

382
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,939
[Cheryl] Don't test us, Mumzie.

383
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:34,525
We know how to dominate, too.

384
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,611
[Archie] <i>Did it come through?</i>

385
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:39,613
-[Josie] Um...
-[Archie] What does it say?

386
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,616
"Unfortunately, we are...

387
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:48,289
unable to invite you
to callbacks this year."

388
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:49,582
I'm sorry, Josie.

389
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:53,753
I know I'm biased, Archie,
but I think I killed that audition.

390
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,630
I sang my heart out.

391
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,592
And it still wasn't enough.

392
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:00,843
Then they're crazy.

393
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,305
-They don't deserve you.
-I've given so much to this.

394
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:10,019
And all along, I've been saying,
"It's okay. It'll be worth it."

395
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:13,981
I've built up so many walls
to focus on this one thing,

396
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:14,899
and now...

397
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,652
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

398
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:21,155
And I'm alone.

399
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:22,948
Hey.

400
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,701
-You're not alone.
-I am.

401
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:28,287
I can't even get a date
to my mom's wedding.

402
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,624
-That speaks volumes.
-I'll do it.

403
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,542
What, be my date?

404
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:37,213
I've been alone these last few months.

405
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,048
Either literally...

406
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,677
or feeling like I'm from Mars,
and it sucks.

407
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:44,595
Yeah.

408
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:48,182
So, maybe I can help you
feel a little less alone.

409
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:49,683
Okay.

410
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:51,602
[Reggie] <i>I can't believe I was shot.</i>

411
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:54,271
Are you sure
you don't wanna go to a doctor, Reggie?

412
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:56,649
No, it's just a graze.

413
00:21:57,024 --> 00:22:00,110
Besides, now I can say I've been shot.

414
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:03,113
Except you can't,
since we want everyone to believe

415
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:06,033
that the Gargoyle Gang robbed
your father's dealership.

416
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:07,618
Right, right.

417
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:10,663
Okay.

418
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:15,084
-Let's see how much money we just copped.
-And pray it's enough.

419
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,213
[grunts]

420
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:20,881
What?

421
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:22,216
A dye pack?

422
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:23,801
Oh, hell.

423
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,052
We're screwed.

424
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,642
[school bell ringing]

425
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,439
I did it. I told my dad.

426
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:39,358
What? You did? How'd it go?

427
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:44,113
He was quiet and weird at first,
but then okay, I think.

428
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:47,825
We went to Pop's after,
got chicken pot pie, which is a good sign.

429
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,911
I'm so proud of you, Moose.

430
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:52,413
That mean you'll be my date?

431
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,874
Yeah, and more importantly...

432
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,960
we should do it, spend the night together.

433
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,129
Question is, where?

434
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:04,717
Don't worry. I know the perfect spot,
where no one will interrupt us.

435
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,263
In a fortuitous turn of events,
Ms. Blossom,

436
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:12,433
Highsmith College's policy
not to admit legacy candidates

437
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:16,145
has been reconsidered,
so, we may proceed with our interview.

438
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,855
Respectfully, Headmistress Patricia,

439
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,733
I know you only perform a limited number
of one-on-ones.

440
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,903
With my qualifications,
legacy status or not,

441
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:25,362
I'm obviously a shoo-in.

442
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,406
I'd like to cede my time

443
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:30,117
to another
unquestionably worthy candidate.

444
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,078
Ms. Antoinette Topaz.

445
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:36,332
Future photojournalist,
and Nobel Peace Prize recipient.

446
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:39,084
It's a pleasure to meet you, headmistress.

447
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:42,838
Knock them dead, babe,
and remember, this is only step two.

448
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,424
Yes. Please, have a seat.

449
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,470
-Do you have your portfolio with you?
-[Toni] Yes, I do.

450
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:51,722
Whoever you are, please, be chill.

451
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,316
[The North Panics'
"Haven't You Heard?" playing]

452
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,947
Oh, great. More teenagers.

453
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,829
Here's your money,
or as much as we could get of it.

454
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,426
Veronica Lodge, I presume.

455
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:34,181
I can't believe your mom sent you out here
to sort out her mess.

456
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:38,185
I mean, I know she's cutthroat,
but, man, that's cold as ice.

457
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,145
Sorry, are we supposed to know you?

458
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:41,563
I'm Gladys Jones.

459
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,734
You might know my kid, Jughead.

460
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,779
-What?
-Seriously?

461
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,948
You're Jughead's mom?

462
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,409
Mrs. Jones,
if you could give us more time,

463
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,703
we could get you the rest of the money.

464
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:57,371
Just don't break our kneecaps.

465
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:03,377
I gotta say, I do admire the fact

466
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,796
that you two came here,
knowing you were short.

467
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:08,215
Shows you know how to take responsibility.

468
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:09,466
Look at the two of you.

469
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:10,634
[scoffs]

470
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:13,512
You remind me a bit of me and FP,
back in the day.

471
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,515
I'll tell you what.
I'm sticking around for a while.

472
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:19,935
So, I will take your money,
but I'm gonna have to charge you a fee,

473
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:22,354
because I'm gonna need
to get it laundered...

474
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:23,897
every which way.

475
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:24,815
Understood.

476
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:27,651
We'll figure out a payment plan
for the rest.

477
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:30,696
But in exchange,
you're gonna lend me those sweet wheels.

478
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:33,449
Not Bella.

479
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:38,287
Please, Mrs. Jones, Reggie loves that car.

480
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,706
I'll make sure
I take real good care of her.

481
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:42,374
Oh, wait, one more thing.

482
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:45,627
Just as a favor,
don't tell Jughead about our business.

483
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:50,049
I mean, if you do,
I'm gonna have to tell Hiram

484
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:52,926
about his missus going behind his back
for a cut,

485
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:55,596
and that'd be bad for all of us.

486
00:25:58,307 --> 00:25:59,558
[Cheryl] <i>Greetings, Moose.</i>

487
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,977
What the hell, Cheryl? What do you want?

488
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,439
To apologize.

489
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:07,900
Outing you was wrong.

490
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:10,986
For so many reasons.

491
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:15,032
It's a personal decision
that I shouldn't have taken from you.

492
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:16,658
I'm sorry.

493
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,289
Apology accepted.

494
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,541
And that's step three.

495
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:25,667
Bon appétit.

496
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:28,128
Cheryl.

497
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:32,341
I'm not saying what you did was right,
but it kind of turned out okay.

498
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:34,426
I'm out to my dad.

499
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,385
[chuckles]

500
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:37,346
And Kevin and I, we, uh...

501
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:41,100
We're finally gonna do it.
Tonight in some secret bunker.

502
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:43,018
Well, well, well, Moose.

503
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:46,271
In that case, I'd bring a fresh set
of sheets, if I were you.

504
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,690
A lot of people have had sex on that cot.

505
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,510
[Fred] Feels like we never left.

506
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,095
'Cause we never did.

507
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:20,806
[FP] The Gargoyle King wants us
to finish Ascension Night.

508
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,808
Better start by finding the chalices.

509
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,685
Then we flip for our fates,

510
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,019
and drink up, game over.

511
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:28,313
-You want us to drink poison?
-[Sierra] Not quite.

512
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:29,815
Penelope, did you bring them?

513
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:33,735
The antidote to cyanide.

514
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:37,781
Drink it now, you'll be inoculated
for the next several hours.

515
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:43,287

00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:39,007
I'm glad it was too late
to cancel the cake.

688
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:40,508
It's beautiful.

689
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:44,888
You're beautiful.

690
00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:47,474
I love you, Sierra.

691
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,101
I love you, Tommy.

692
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:52,645
[Moose] <i>I can't stay, Kev.</i>

693
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:54,731
I just...

694
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:56,483
I came to tell you that...

695
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,819
I'm, uh, moving to Glendale
to stay with my aunt.

696
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:04,365
Moose, your friends are here and I'm here,
and you can live with any of us.

697
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:05,283
Kevin.

698
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:06,576
Hey.

699
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:10,205
I can't live here.

700
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,750
At least not for a little while.

701
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:30,558
I'll miss you, Marmaduke.

702
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:32,977
I'll miss you, Kevin Keller.

703
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:56,209
It's so messed up, what Major Mason did.

704
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:59,379
It was the Sisters' conversion therapy.
It twisted his soul.

705
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:03,550
Well, I'm glad we got you
out of that hellhole when we did.

706
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:06,219
I'll never forget the day you saved me,
Tee-Tee.

707
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:10,223
And since you've done so much for me,
I wanted to do something for you.

708
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,559
Call it step four.

709
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:18,273
What's this?

710
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:21,234
[Cheryl] A gang, if you want it.

711
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:24,195
You said you were missing
having the Serpents as a family.

712
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:26,948
I found some other girls
who were looking for support,

713
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,032
or community,

714
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:30,785
or just good old-fashioned fisticuffs.

715
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:35,999
And I thought
maybe we could start a new family.

716
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:45,174
Cheryl, this is the most badass
and romantic thing you've ever done.

717
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:49,929
[clearing throat]
Uh... Do we have a name yet?

718
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,015
How about...

719
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:56,185
the Pretty Poisons?

720
00:39:58,021 --> 00:40:00,023
Pretty by day, poison by night.

721
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:01,900
I love it.

722
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,194
-You said you have an update for me?
-Yeah.

723
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:06,404
But first...

724
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:10,408
You could've told us
that the secret buyer was Jughead's Mom.

725
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:13,870
Wait. Gladys showed up?

726
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:18,750
I assumed that she would've sent
one of her deputies up from Toledo.

727
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:19,667
Nope.

728
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:21,502
And about Toledo, Mom?

729
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:23,922
I've got news for you.

730
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:27,592
I don't think Gladys is leaving
anytime soon.

731
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:34,182
Everything's going how you said, Mom.
Dad's wrapped around my pinky.

732
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,476
You're his weakness, baby.

733
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:41,814
Which means we got the whole town, JB.

734
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,734
Your old man's the sheriff.

735
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,528
The mayor owes us serious cash.

736
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:50,073
Hell, even her daughter's
working for me now.

737
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,157
Oh, yeah.

738
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:54,661
We moved to the right place
at the right time.

739
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:55,787
I could feel it.

Can I kiss you?
