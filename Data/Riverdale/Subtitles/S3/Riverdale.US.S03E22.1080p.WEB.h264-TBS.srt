1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,449
Previously on Riverdale...

2
00:00:02,452 --> 00:00:05,194
Hiram Lodge, you're under arrest.

3
00:00:05,197 --> 00:00:07,581
My own daughter, working with the Feds.

4
00:00:07,583 --> 00:00:08,957
Is there someone else here?

5
00:00:08,959 --> 00:00:11,560
I came to tell her that
I wanted to be with her.

6
00:00:11,563 --> 00:00:14,689
Gryphons and Gargoyles is
literally killing people.

7
00:00:14,692 --> 00:00:16,973
There was something
lodged in his throat.

8
00:00:16,976 --> 00:00:19,139
A matchbook from the Maple Club.

9
00:00:19,142 --> 00:00:21,139
According to Ethel, Jason Blossom

10
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,636
is the Gargoyle King.

11
00:00:22,639 --> 00:00:24,017
The return of the Black Hood.

12
00:00:24,018 --> 00:00:25,965
Now we have two serial
killers running around.

13
00:00:25,967 --> 00:00:27,438
Possibly working together.

14
00:00:27,441 --> 00:00:29,946
Let the Farm protect you. Both of you.

15
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:32,230
The Farm gave me back my brother.

16
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:33,681
Yes. I see my son.

17
00:00:33,683 --> 00:00:36,865
Charles. And it's like I never lost him.

18
00:00:36,868 --> 00:00:40,988
There's a refrigerator filled
to the brim with human organs.

19
00:00:40,991 --> 00:00:43,417
Prepare Betty for her procedure.

20
00:00:43,419 --> 00:00:45,077
Get your hands off my girlfriend!

21
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:47,621
Toni, this is your
only chance at freedom.

22
00:00:47,624 --> 00:00:49,266
No, run! Go!

23
00:00:51,827 --> 00:00:53,427
There, there, Antoinette.

24
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:56,171
Now that you've settled down
with a cup of calming tea,

25
00:00:56,173 --> 00:00:58,599
why don't you explain
this to me one more time?

26
00:00:58,601 --> 00:01:02,010
Mrs. Blossom, Cheryl is in danger.

27
00:01:02,012 --> 00:01:06,005
She's at the Farm with
Betty, Kevin, and Fangs

28
00:01:06,007 --> 00:01:07,849
and Edgar Evernever.

29
00:01:07,851 --> 00:01:12,011
And he's harvesting
organs from his followers.

30
00:01:12,013 --> 00:01:16,432
Oh, dear. Is that what he's doing there?

31
00:01:16,434 --> 00:01:18,952
Well, isn't it fortunate I
was here collecting my mail

32
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:21,271
at Thistlehouse when you arrived?

33
00:01:21,273 --> 00:01:23,273
And Betty's with him, you say?

34
00:01:23,275 --> 00:01:27,461
Yeah, and, um, we need to
go save them because we...

35
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,301
Good night, my dear.

36
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:38,471
Thank you for the information.

37
00:01:38,474 --> 00:01:41,684
Very timely indeed.

38
00:01:41,687 --> 00:01:43,877
I refuse to accept what Ethel said.

39
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:46,462
That Jason Blossom is the Gargoyle King.

40
00:01:46,464 --> 00:01:48,339
Even though his coffin was empty,

41
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:49,558
it defies logic.

42
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,486
Well, say Ethel is off her rocker, okay,

43
00:01:52,488 --> 00:01:54,700
but where's Jason's body?

44
00:01:54,703 --> 00:01:58,371
And someone's still wearing
the Gargoyle King's antler, so

45
00:01:58,374 --> 00:02:01,620
it's up to you and me to figure
out who, Blossom or no Blossom.

46
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,146
I keep thinking about that matchbook

47
00:02:03,148 --> 00:02:05,585
that Dr. Curdle found
in Baby Teeth's throat.

48
00:02:05,588 --> 00:02:08,148
Kurtz must have got that
at the Maple Club, right?

49
00:02:08,151 --> 00:02:09,667
What are you getting at, boy?

50
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:12,104
Do you have a copy of
Kurtz's mugshot I can borrow?

51
00:02:22,493 --> 00:02:23,500
Dad?

52
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,570
Sorry to interrupt,
but you have a visitor.

53
00:02:27,572 --> 00:02:29,414
She says it can't wait.

54
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:32,492
Mrs. Blossom, what can I do for you?

55
00:02:32,494 --> 00:02:35,703
Let's not mince words, Mr. Evernever.

56
00:02:35,705 --> 00:02:39,508
I am fully aware of the foul
activities you're conducting here.

57
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,584
The Topaz girl told me.

58
00:02:41,586 --> 00:02:46,065
I have no interest in
exposing your shenanigans.

59
00:02:46,067 --> 00:02:47,849
Then why have you come?

60
00:02:47,851 --> 00:02:50,426
You have something that I want.

61
00:02:50,428 --> 00:02:53,489
- Mrs. Blossom...
- You sell organs, don't you?

62
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,450
I'm looking to buy in bulk.

63
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,876
Did you ever see a client
in here by the name of Kurtz

64
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,129
at the Maple Club? He looked like this.

65
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,493
Yes.

66
00:03:07,496 --> 00:03:09,445
I never worked with him directly.

67
00:03:09,447 --> 00:03:10,522
Who did he work with?

68
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,866
All of his interactions were with...

69
00:03:12,868 --> 00:03:14,951
The Red Dahlia? Penelope Blossom?

70
00:03:14,953 --> 00:03:16,018
Yeah.

71
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,045
Out of curiosity,

72
00:03:19,048 --> 00:03:22,799
you never saw Penelope with a
young man, a young redhead, did you?

73
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:25,461
You mean her kid, Jason?

74
00:03:25,463 --> 00:03:27,397
Yeah, sure. He came around.

75
00:03:29,652 --> 00:03:32,677
We've been compromised, Evelyn.

76
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,637
We've had too many breaches.

77
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,181
- It's time.
- Edgar.

78
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:37,324
What's happening?

79
00:03:37,326 --> 00:03:38,975
Why is everyone acting so skittish?

80
00:03:38,977 --> 00:03:42,737
The outside world is encroaching
upon us, Sister Alice.

81
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:44,981
We've had both defectors

82
00:03:44,983 --> 00:03:47,774
and unwelcome visitors.

83
00:03:47,777 --> 00:03:50,337
The Ascension is upon us. Tonight.

84
00:03:50,339 --> 00:03:51,599
The Ascension?

85
00:03:52,675 --> 00:03:54,824
- Tonight?
- Yes.

86
00:03:54,826 --> 00:03:56,492
Preparations are being made.

87
00:03:56,495 --> 00:03:58,764
Well, I need to find
Betty. Have you seen her?

88
00:03:58,767 --> 00:04:01,331
- Uh...
- She escaped, with Toni Topaz.

89
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,407
Escaped?

90
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:06,687
She was never a
believer like you, Alice.

91
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:09,231
So we will ascend without her.

92
00:04:21,853 --> 00:04:23,853
In the wake of Mr. Lodge's arrest,

93
00:04:23,855 --> 00:04:26,448
you now have full
ownership of the Pembrooke

94
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:29,359
and all other Lodge
investment properties.

95
00:04:29,361 --> 00:04:32,070
And, Veronica, you and your
mother are now the co-owners

96
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:35,174
of Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe
and the speakeasy beneath it.

97
00:04:37,461 --> 00:04:42,538
Now, there's one more
property I'm curious about.

98
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,541
Mom, that was Veronica on the
phone with some amazing news.

99
00:04:45,543 --> 00:04:47,728
She said she's giving me the El Royale.

100
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,730
That I legit own the
gym now, free and clear.

101
00:04:49,732 --> 00:04:53,150
That's a very generous gift, Archie.

102
00:04:53,152 --> 00:04:57,154
But still, I'm interested in
where you two stand romantically.

103
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:02,766
Are we expecting anyone?

104
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:15,238
Someone left mine at the door.

105
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,481
Mine, too.

106
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:17,999
My dad or Jellybean could have found it.

107
00:05:18,001 --> 00:05:19,784
Mine was waiting for me downstairs,

108
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:20,777
at the speakeasy.

109
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,412
Are we sure they're not fakes?

110
00:05:22,414 --> 00:05:23,645
I don't think so.

111
00:05:23,648 --> 00:05:25,248
And I've been trying Betty at the Farm,

112
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,833
but she's not answering.

113
00:05:26,835 --> 00:05:28,769
The invitations say not to tell anyone

114
00:05:28,771 --> 00:05:29,919
and not to bring our phones.

115
00:05:29,921 --> 00:05:31,063
So it's a trap.

116
00:05:32,474 --> 00:05:34,566
Was there ever a doubt?

117
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:36,154
We don't really have a choice.

118
00:05:52,263 --> 00:05:56,559
_

119
00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:12,097
Guys.

120
00:06:14,503 --> 00:06:16,812
Elizabeth. Pretty.

121
00:06:18,232 --> 00:06:19,506
Good evening.

122
00:06:19,508 --> 00:06:21,468
Come and join us, why don't you?

123
00:06:22,153 --> 00:06:23,444
Penelope.

124
00:06:25,197 --> 00:06:27,722
What... What is this place?

125
00:06:27,724 --> 00:06:30,942
This is the Blossom Hunting Lodge

126
00:06:30,944 --> 00:06:32,536
on the grounds of Thornhill.

127
00:06:33,622 --> 00:06:34,780
How did I get here?

128
00:06:34,782 --> 00:06:37,690
I bought you from Mr. Evernever.

129
00:06:37,692 --> 00:06:40,586
Just as he was about to cut
you into butcher's parts.

130
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:45,532
Now, Agatha here will
show you to your place.

131
00:06:45,534 --> 00:06:47,051
Sister Woodhouse.

132
00:06:47,911 --> 00:06:50,245
You naughty, naughty girl.

133
00:06:50,247 --> 00:06:53,140
Agatha was one of my mentors.

134
00:06:53,142 --> 00:06:57,186
She cared for me when I was an
orphan at The Sisters of Quiet Mercy.

135
00:06:57,188 --> 00:06:59,480
Taught me everything
I know about poisons.

136
00:07:02,042 --> 00:07:03,309
The murdered nuns.

137
00:07:04,904 --> 00:07:06,553
You did that?

138
00:07:06,555 --> 00:07:08,197
Oh, loose ends.

139
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:10,348
Such a bother, aren't they?

140
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,817
"Loose ends"?

141
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:13,693
Is that what we are?

142
00:07:13,695 --> 00:07:15,412
Oh, gosh. No, not you.

143
00:07:15,414 --> 00:07:18,837
You are featured players.

144
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,235
The sons and daughters of
the original Midnight Club.

145
00:07:22,237 --> 00:07:23,995
Jug, what's happening?

146
00:07:23,997 --> 00:07:25,280
I've almost figured it out.

147
00:07:25,282 --> 00:07:26,665
Oh, have you?

148
00:07:26,667 --> 00:07:29,617
Because if anybody could,
it would be you, Mr. Jones.

149
00:07:29,619 --> 00:07:32,271
But first, two more guests.

150
00:07:33,861 --> 00:07:35,781
I believe you know them already.

151
00:07:46,094 --> 00:07:47,686
What have I told you?

152
00:07:47,688 --> 00:07:50,091
No masks at the dinner table.

153
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,119
Take them off.

154
00:07:54,644 --> 00:07:55,804
Oh, my God.

155
00:07:59,316 --> 00:08:01,857
Wait, King, before you do...

156
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,127
Hellcaster.

157
00:08:04,088 --> 00:08:05,379
Care to take a stab?

158
00:08:07,127 --> 00:08:08,290
Sure.

159
00:08:09,951 --> 00:08:12,210
Arthur Conan Doyle famously said,

160
00:08:12,212 --> 00:08:15,121
"Once you eliminate the
impossible, whatever remains,

161
00:08:15,123 --> 00:08:17,641
however improbable, must be the truth."

162
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,144
In which case,

163
00:08:20,146 --> 00:08:21,961
whoever it is underneath that mask

164
00:08:21,963 --> 00:08:23,722
must've had a connection to Hell

165
00:08:23,724 --> 00:08:25,315
and to you, Penelope.

166
00:08:25,317 --> 00:08:27,397
But it's not Jason, because he's dead.

167
00:08:28,345 --> 00:08:30,803
Even though his corpse is missing.

168
00:08:30,805 --> 00:08:33,532
The one corpse that
hasn't been accounted for

169
00:08:33,534 --> 00:08:36,642
and who was last seen
by the Black Hood...

170
00:08:36,645 --> 00:08:38,285
- Chic.
- ...is Chic.

171
00:08:43,778 --> 00:08:45,128
What the hell?

172
00:08:45,131 --> 00:08:47,361
Since when does Chic have red hair?

173
00:08:47,364 --> 00:08:50,503
I'm guessing since he
started working with Penelope.

174
00:08:50,506 --> 00:08:52,398
Doing her bidding.

175
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:56,099
But this was after he got the
Gargoyle symbols tattooed on his back.

176
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:58,446
It's why Ethel said the
Gargoyle King was Jason.

177
00:08:59,259 --> 00:09:01,531
Because you called him Jason.

178
00:09:01,534 --> 00:09:03,845
'Cause you dressed him up like Jason.

179
00:09:03,847 --> 00:09:06,315
You didn't murder Chic.

180
00:09:06,317 --> 00:09:08,675
After you chased him
through the woods, you...

181
00:09:08,677 --> 00:09:10,718
I recognized a kinship in him,

182
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,978
and I spared him.

183
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:15,199
He begged for mercy and
pledged his life to me

184
00:09:15,201 --> 00:09:16,724
in service of my mission.

185
00:09:16,726 --> 00:09:19,852
But it wasn't just your
mission, was it, Mr. Cooper?

186
00:09:19,854 --> 00:09:21,152
Maybe not at first,

187
00:09:21,155 --> 00:09:23,505
but eventually, you started
working with someone else

188
00:09:23,508 --> 00:09:25,816
who also had a grudge against Riverdale.

189
00:09:25,819 --> 00:09:29,362
In the middle of all that stuff
with the Black Hood last year,

190
00:09:29,364 --> 00:09:33,625
my dad was having an
affair with Penelope.

191
00:09:33,627 --> 00:09:36,136
Yes, I did cultivate your father's...

192
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:39,431
murderous impulses,

193
00:09:39,433 --> 00:09:40,891
it's true.

194
00:09:40,893 --> 00:09:43,393
To take my revenge on a town

195
00:09:43,395 --> 00:09:47,260
that allowed me to be sold as
a child bride to the Blossoms.

196
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:50,198
Your parents knew. I told them.

197
00:09:50,201 --> 00:09:52,642
And they did nothing but mock me.

198
00:09:52,645 --> 00:09:55,882
And years later, when my Jason
was murdered in cold blood,

199
00:09:57,392 --> 00:10:02,186
do you think one of
them reached out to me?

200
00:10:02,188 --> 00:10:06,416
No, they were too busy ignoring
the rotting, fetid truth

201
00:10:06,418 --> 00:10:09,753
that Riverdale is a
hideous and cruel place,

202
00:10:09,755 --> 00:10:11,338
twisted and cursed.

203
00:10:15,076 --> 00:10:17,511
And the Black Hood and I,
we were doing quite well.

204
00:10:21,216 --> 00:10:23,049
Exterminating its sinners.

205
00:10:23,051 --> 00:10:24,709
Until my dad got arrested.

206
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:28,628
Yes, but that was fine because
Hal's disciple came to me,

207
00:10:28,631 --> 00:10:30,648
lost, and I gave him purpose.

208
00:10:30,651 --> 00:10:32,634
To continue our great work.

209
00:10:32,636 --> 00:10:34,185
But not as the Black Hood.

210
00:10:34,187 --> 00:10:36,822
So instead, you made him
dress up like the boogeyman.

211
00:10:38,284 --> 00:10:39,641
The Gargoyle King.

212
00:10:39,643 --> 00:10:44,519
You introduced G&G to
our parents 25 years ago,

213
00:10:44,522 --> 00:10:48,510
and then reintroduced
it this year to Chic.

214
00:10:48,513 --> 00:10:50,836
- His name is Jason.
- Who gave it to...

215
00:10:52,169 --> 00:10:53,686
Ben Button.

216
00:10:53,689 --> 00:10:55,769
Who started playing with Dilton Doiley.

217
00:10:56,749 --> 00:10:58,235
Then Ethel Muggs.

218
00:11:00,121 --> 00:11:05,559
And then G&G spread
like a virus or a poison.

219
00:11:05,561 --> 00:11:08,219
And the true mastermind behind it all...

220
00:11:08,221 --> 00:11:10,897
the true king is you, Penelope.

221
00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:12,382
Oh.

222
00:11:12,384 --> 00:11:13,861
Well done.

223
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:15,683
Well done.

224
00:11:19,015 --> 00:11:22,659
But now, it's time to
play one final round.

225
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:25,236
With you, the Midnight children.

226
00:11:25,238 --> 00:11:26,622
To what end?

227
00:11:26,624 --> 00:11:29,148
Say it's to reveal your true nature.

228
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:34,696
To prove that you are as dark-hearted
as the town that birthed you.

229
00:11:34,698 --> 00:11:35,996
And what?

230
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:37,532
If we win, we escape?

231
00:11:37,534 --> 00:11:38,658
You won't win.

232
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,243
So what happens if we lose?

233
00:11:40,245 --> 00:11:44,589
Well, then, your parents will
feel the pain that I felt.

234
00:11:44,591 --> 00:11:46,874
The death of a child.

235
00:11:46,876 --> 00:11:49,019
Could there by anything more dreadful?

236
00:11:49,021 --> 00:11:50,712
You're nuts.

237
00:11:54,384 --> 00:11:55,567
It is time.

238
00:11:58,105 --> 00:12:00,065
Come to the lawn for the gathering.

239
00:12:06,187 --> 00:12:09,564
The task before you is simple.

240
00:12:09,566 --> 00:12:13,317
Make it through the
woods, survive the night.

241
00:12:13,319 --> 00:12:15,959
You will be tested, each of you.

242
00:12:15,962 --> 00:12:19,368
Refuse my tests or try to escape,

243
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:22,537
and my Gargoyle minion will kill you.

244
00:12:24,063 --> 00:12:27,040
May the final quest begin!

245
00:12:29,886 --> 00:12:31,895
I'd start running if I were you.

246
00:12:39,697 --> 00:12:43,038

247
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:49,465
The good news is, if Penelope
wanted us dead, we would be.

248
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:50,556
She wants us alive.

249
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,825
Yeah, well, at least long enough to
complete her bizarre social experiment.

250
00:12:54,828 --> 00:12:56,068
Yeah, or die trying.

251
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,820
We don't even know where to go.

252
00:12:57,822 --> 00:13:01,299
Actually, Enchantress, we might.

253
00:13:02,911 --> 00:13:04,219
Come on, let's go.

254
00:13:05,747 --> 00:13:07,431
Kevin, Fangs.

255
00:13:07,433 --> 00:13:09,113
Save those eyes for the bedroom, boys.

256
00:13:09,116 --> 00:13:10,891
We're getting out of
this house of the devil.

257
00:13:10,894 --> 00:13:14,795
Cheryl, aren't you confined to
your room for helping Toni escape?

258
00:13:14,798 --> 00:13:17,714
Yeah, and suddenly you're
sounding a lot like Betty.

259
00:13:17,717 --> 00:13:18,998
Betty knew the score.

260
00:13:19,001 --> 00:13:21,242
Edgar Evernever is harvesting organs.

261
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:26,675
Come with me.

262
00:13:26,677 --> 00:13:29,877
Betty told me exactly where Edgar
keeps his innards collection.

263
00:13:35,777 --> 00:13:38,044
Are you still seeing organs, Cheryl?

264
00:13:38,705 --> 00:13:39,987
What?

265
00:13:39,989 --> 00:13:41,948
Edgar must've moved them, or Evelyn did.

266
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:44,450
Cheryl, we are getting ready to ascend.

267
00:13:44,452 --> 00:13:45,706
And you should, too.

268
00:13:46,697 --> 00:13:48,713
What if I get my hands
on irrefutable proof

269
00:13:48,715 --> 00:13:51,141
that Edgar Evernever is a
modern day Dr. Frankenstein?

270
00:13:51,143 --> 00:13:53,510
You know what? Sure.

271
00:13:53,512 --> 00:13:56,062
Then proof, Kevin, is
what you shall have.

272
00:14:07,567 --> 00:14:08,950
Where the hell are they?

273
00:14:21,173 --> 00:14:22,825
Who's there?

274
00:14:22,835 --> 00:14:24,227
Reveal thyself.

275
00:14:27,373 --> 00:14:29,290
I'm in no mood.

276
00:14:29,293 --> 00:14:30,685
I said who are...

277
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,680
It's a Red Paladin card.

278
00:14:47,724 --> 00:14:49,684
Archie, this question's for you.

279
00:14:55,781 --> 00:14:59,024
"The Red Paladin must
conquer the grizzled beast.

280
00:14:59,027 --> 00:15:02,170
He must battle alone in
the Pit to save his home."

281
00:15:03,072 --> 00:15:05,197
What is a grizzled beast?

282
00:15:08,369 --> 00:15:09,475
Oh, crap.

283
00:15:10,455 --> 00:15:11,555
Not again.

284
00:15:25,219 --> 00:15:26,477
Archie.

285
00:15:26,479 --> 00:15:28,146
Don't do this.

286
00:15:28,148 --> 00:15:30,598
That guy is eight feet tall and jacked.

287
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,058
It's just a fight.

288
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,935
I've been fighting all year.

289
00:15:33,937 --> 00:15:36,896
Don't forget, I survived a
real bear attack, remember?

290
00:15:36,898 --> 00:15:38,940
If I don't make it,

291
00:15:38,942 --> 00:15:40,750
tell my mom and dad I love them.

292
00:15:40,752 --> 00:15:41,877
And you guys.

293
00:17:17,331 --> 00:17:18,503
Hey.

294
00:17:21,148 --> 00:17:22,352
Come here.

295
00:17:30,845 --> 00:17:33,071
Archie, are you sure you're okay?

296
00:17:34,348 --> 00:17:36,308
Apart from every inch of my body.

297
00:17:37,351 --> 00:17:39,035
What do we do now?

298
00:17:39,037 --> 00:17:40,686
We gotta keep moving.

299
00:17:40,688 --> 00:17:42,768
Penelope has already left us more clues.

300
00:17:44,332 --> 00:17:45,509
Come on.

301
00:17:47,361 --> 00:17:49,737
What troubles you, Sister Alice?

302
00:17:49,739 --> 00:17:51,593
I can't get in touch with Betty,

303
00:17:51,596 --> 00:17:55,229
and I'm hearing rumors.

304
00:17:55,232 --> 00:17:58,788
Whisperings about harvesting?

305
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,306
I see.

306
00:18:02,376 --> 00:18:04,019
May I address your concerns?

307
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:13,311
Unfortunately, there's
not much I can say

308
00:18:13,313 --> 00:18:15,572
about Betty or where she is.

309
00:18:16,983 --> 00:18:18,491
About the rumors...

310
00:18:20,436 --> 00:18:25,040
I admit, I have not
been entirely truthful

311
00:18:25,042 --> 00:18:28,367
about all the activities at the Farm.

312
00:18:28,369 --> 00:18:30,328
What kind of sick monster are you?

313
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,953
Cheryl, I'm in a meeting.

314
00:18:31,956 --> 00:18:33,455
Please respect Sister Alice.

315
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:37,388
Why? Why would you do such
a thing to my own brother?

316
00:18:38,861 --> 00:18:42,043
You had a void.

317
00:18:43,435 --> 00:18:46,511
It's my job to diagnose how to fill it.

318
00:18:46,513 --> 00:18:47,920
By grave-robbing?

319
00:18:47,922 --> 00:18:49,680
- Wait, what?
- Grab her.

320
00:18:49,682 --> 00:18:52,466
No! Get your hands off me!

321
00:18:52,468 --> 00:18:54,444
Confine Ms. Blossom to her room.

322
00:18:54,446 --> 00:18:55,928
You won't get away with this.

323
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,096
Toni will come for me.

324
00:18:57,098 --> 00:18:58,689
Kevin's father is a lawman!

325
00:19:03,622 --> 00:19:06,105
Evelyn, Sister Alice,

326
00:19:06,107 --> 00:19:08,708
will you help me gather
our flock in the chamber?

327
00:19:10,619 --> 00:19:12,887
So that we may ascend with the...

328
00:19:28,212 --> 00:19:30,221
"The Fate and Fortune Challenge.

329
00:19:30,223 --> 00:19:31,815
Before you are six chalices,

330
00:19:31,817 --> 00:19:33,465
each filled with Gargoyle blood.

331
00:19:33,467 --> 00:19:37,136
The Enchantress must choose
her closest companion.

332
00:19:37,138 --> 00:19:39,346
They will each take
turns spinning the bottle

333
00:19:39,348 --> 00:19:42,641
and drinking from the chosen chalice.

334
00:19:42,643 --> 00:19:45,060
But beware, for one of
the chalices contains

335
00:19:45,062 --> 00:19:47,646
a lethal, rapid-acting venom."

336
00:19:47,648 --> 00:19:49,648
Seriously? Spin the bottle?

337
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:50,850
More like Russian roulette.

338
00:19:52,245 --> 00:19:54,153
That's suicide. I refuse.

339
00:19:54,155 --> 00:19:56,822
"Refusal to participate in the challenge

340
00:19:56,824 --> 00:19:59,175
results in the immediate execution

341
00:19:59,177 --> 00:20:01,327
of all remaining party members.

342
00:20:01,329 --> 00:20:04,205
Remember, we're watching."

343
00:20:04,207 --> 00:20:07,758
Vee, the scroll says you have
to choose your closest companion.

344
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,335
I volunteer.

345
00:20:09,337 --> 00:20:10,761
Betty, no.

346
00:20:10,763 --> 00:20:13,580
It's okay. I have faith.

347
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,823
And what's the alternative? We
get shot in the woods by snipers?

348
00:20:21,849 --> 00:20:24,117
I'm having a diabolical
sense of deja vu.

349
00:20:44,487 --> 00:20:46,061
How do you feel?

350
00:20:46,064 --> 00:20:47,207
I think I'm fine.

351
00:21:06,435 --> 00:21:07,619
I'm okay, Vee.

352
00:21:47,026 --> 00:21:48,785
50-50 odds.

353
00:22:13,836 --> 00:22:15,219
Okay.

354
00:22:15,221 --> 00:22:16,271
No.

355
00:22:16,273 --> 00:22:17,873
- Vee.
- Veronica.

356
00:22:20,435 --> 00:22:22,352
Why did you do that?

357
00:22:22,355 --> 00:22:24,315
Because I love you, Bee.

358
00:22:25,222 --> 00:22:27,323
You're my best friend, and...

359
00:22:27,325 --> 00:22:28,658
I love you too, Vee.

360
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:35,890
Remarkable, Enchantress.

361
00:22:35,893 --> 00:22:38,524
You've completed your challenge,

362
00:22:38,527 --> 00:22:40,486
and proven your loyalty.

363
00:22:40,488 --> 00:22:42,154
- What?
- What?

364
00:22:42,156 --> 00:22:45,532
Of course. It was a character challenge.

365
00:22:45,534 --> 00:22:47,993
The game was testing if
you had honor and loyalty.

366
00:22:47,995 --> 00:22:49,679
None of the chalices were poisoned.

367
00:22:49,681 --> 00:22:51,663
On the contrary,

368
00:22:51,665 --> 00:22:53,665
all of the chalices were poisoned.

369
00:22:54,761 --> 00:22:56,411
It's slow-acting,

370
00:22:56,413 --> 00:22:59,188
but the only way to obtain the
antidote is to finish the game,

371
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:01,482
and even then, you might not make it.

372
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,871
Tick tock.

373
00:23:23,627 --> 00:23:24,804
Hey.

374
00:23:28,536 --> 00:23:31,128
I need to say something.

375
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:33,205
I don't know what's going
on with you and Reggie.

376
00:23:33,207 --> 00:23:34,683
He's my friend.

377
00:23:34,686 --> 00:23:36,225
But I love you.

378
00:23:38,471 --> 00:23:41,213
Veronica, I don't think
I've ever stopped loving you.

379
00:23:41,215 --> 00:23:42,297
Archie...

380
00:23:44,885 --> 00:23:46,152
The night of the fight,

381
00:23:47,888 --> 00:23:49,888
nothing happened with Reggie

382
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:52,224
after you showed up at the Pembrooke.

383
00:23:52,226 --> 00:23:54,202
My heart ached for you...

384
00:23:55,655 --> 00:23:57,372
because I felt the same way.

385
00:24:01,444 --> 00:24:03,669
I love you, Archiekins.

386
00:24:05,075 --> 00:24:06,922
For whatever good that does us now.

387
00:24:06,925 --> 00:24:10,617
Hey, I'm not letting
you die tonight, okay?

388
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:13,179
None of us dies tonight, I swear.

389
00:24:17,637 --> 00:24:18,793
Do you believe me?

390
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:46,311
I'm warning you.

391
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,048
Shh.

392
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,324
What are you going to do to me?

393
00:24:50,326 --> 00:24:51,317
Nothing.

394
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,434
I'm here to help you
escape. Hurry. Come with me.

395
00:24:53,437 --> 00:24:54,620
Why would I trust you?

396
00:24:54,622 --> 00:24:57,247
You're as brainwashed
as Patty Hearst was.

397
00:24:57,249 --> 00:24:58,516
What choice do you have?

398
00:25:04,131 --> 00:25:06,632
There's a tunnel down here
that leads to Fox Forest.

399
00:25:06,634 --> 00:25:09,801
I remember. But Betty
said it was bricked up.

400
00:25:09,803 --> 00:25:12,179
Edgar reopened it when
he bought the compound.

401
00:25:12,181 --> 00:25:14,657
Here, take Juniper,

402
00:25:14,659 --> 00:25:16,808
reunite her with Dagwood.

403
00:25:16,811 --> 00:25:19,144
Wait, what? Aren't you coming?

404
00:25:19,147 --> 00:25:21,330
I have to stay for Polly.

405
00:25:21,332 --> 00:25:25,692
But please, Cheryl, swear
to me you'll find Betty.

406
00:25:25,694 --> 00:25:28,153
Make sure she's safe from the Farm.

407
00:25:28,155 --> 00:25:29,914
From her father.

408
00:25:29,916 --> 00:25:31,928
- Please.
- I promise.

409
00:25:33,035 --> 00:25:34,844
Okay. Now go.

410
00:25:36,205 --> 00:25:38,285
Don't stop running
until you get to town.

411
00:25:44,171 --> 00:25:45,855
Wake up, child.

412
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:48,191
Nana?

413
00:25:48,193 --> 00:25:50,676
What the hell is going on?

414
00:25:50,678 --> 00:25:52,770
There's no time, Antoinette.

415
00:25:52,772 --> 00:25:54,772
The hunt is afoot.

416
00:25:54,774 --> 00:25:57,015
What? What hunt?

417
00:25:57,017 --> 00:25:59,109
At the Thornhill Nature Preserve.

418
00:25:59,111 --> 00:26:02,371
Your school chums are the prey.

419
00:26:02,373 --> 00:26:04,540
You must save them.

420
00:26:04,542 --> 00:26:07,651
Look, I don't know what the
hell you're talking about.

421
00:26:07,653 --> 00:26:09,962
But first, I need to save Cheryl.

422
00:26:17,722 --> 00:26:19,096
You're up, Jug.

423
00:26:20,874 --> 00:26:23,041
"The Battle of Kings.

424
00:26:23,043 --> 00:26:25,937
Only one shall leave the
Kingdom of Eldervair."

425
00:27:05,393 --> 00:27:06,631
Why are you doing this?

426
00:27:07,272 --> 00:27:08,904
Why be the Gargoyle King?

427
00:27:09,923 --> 00:27:11,757
Who doesn't wanna be king?

428
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:14,277
Who doesn't want blood
sacrifices made in their name?

429
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:16,195
Wow. Okay.

430
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:35,881
Jug!

431
00:27:57,638 --> 00:27:58,904
Are you okay?

432
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:01,574
Jug.

433
00:28:03,903 --> 00:28:05,077
It's Penelope's poison.

434
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,072
We gotta keep moving.

435
00:28:08,074 --> 00:28:09,277
Come on.

436
00:28:16,224 --> 00:28:18,082
Wait, I still don't get it.

437
00:28:18,084 --> 00:28:21,543
Chic got red hair because Penelope's
pretending that he's Jason Blossom?

438
00:28:21,545 --> 00:28:24,680
Can we explore the craziness
that is Oedipus Riverdale

439
00:28:24,682 --> 00:28:27,683
after we get the antidote
and out of these damn woods?

440
00:28:27,685 --> 00:28:30,225
Maybe figuring out how
all of this is connected

441
00:28:30,228 --> 00:28:32,061
is exactly what we should be doing.

442
00:28:32,064 --> 00:28:34,398
Hal, Penelope, Chic...

443
00:28:34,401 --> 00:28:36,359
They created this unholy trinity

444
00:28:36,361 --> 00:28:38,343
with direct links to everything bad

445
00:28:38,345 --> 00:28:40,971
that has happened in
the last three years.

446
00:28:40,973 --> 00:28:43,824
It's like Jason Blossom's
death begat the Black Hood,

447
00:28:43,827 --> 00:28:45,609
which begat the Gargoyle King.

448
00:28:45,611 --> 00:28:48,687
But the Gargoyle King existed
before Jason was killed.

449
00:28:48,689 --> 00:28:51,782
Then it's a case of a
serpent eating its own tail.

450
00:28:51,784 --> 00:28:54,884
It's a vicious cycle
of never-ending madness

451
00:28:54,887 --> 00:28:57,069
that turns back on
itself over and over again

452
00:28:57,072 --> 00:28:58,506
until someone breaks the chain.

453
00:29:07,216 --> 00:29:08,611
Toni.

454
00:29:08,614 --> 00:29:09,809
Baby?

455
00:29:18,736 --> 00:29:21,331
We were just coming to
save you from the Farm.

456
00:29:21,334 --> 00:29:23,600
- How'd you get out?
- An angel in disguise.

457
00:29:26,756 --> 00:29:27,868
Where's Betty?

458
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:30,896
She's being hunted at Thornhill

459
00:29:30,898 --> 00:29:32,397
with all the others.

460
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:33,741
What are you talking about, Nana?

461
00:29:33,743 --> 00:29:37,161
Your mother has been
preparing for this for weeks,

462
00:29:37,163 --> 00:29:38,491
if not months.

463
00:29:39,398 --> 00:29:42,239
It's the grand hunt.

464
00:29:42,242 --> 00:29:43,759
We have to go there.

465
00:29:43,761 --> 00:29:45,952
We have to save them.

466
00:29:45,954 --> 00:29:48,839
Poisons, Serpents, let's ride!

467
00:29:53,438 --> 00:29:55,337
Looks like it's my turn.

468
00:29:55,339 --> 00:29:56,486
Hey.

469
00:29:58,276 --> 00:29:59,400
I love you.

470
00:30:00,312 --> 00:30:01,653
I love you, too.

471
00:30:48,475 --> 00:30:50,117
You know how this has to end.

472
00:30:52,187 --> 00:30:54,020
You have to kill me, Betty.

473
00:30:54,022 --> 00:30:56,648
That's your heart, that's your truth.

474
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:58,459
You can't deny your destiny.

475
00:31:01,172 --> 00:31:03,989
Don't make me do this, please.

476
00:31:03,991 --> 00:31:07,751
Either kill me and get the antidote,

477
00:31:07,753 --> 00:31:09,845
or I will kill you and your friends.

478
00:31:11,015 --> 00:31:12,975
You have till the count of three.

479
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,519
Either shoot me or I'll shoot you.

480
00:31:22,193 --> 00:31:23,400
One...

481
00:31:27,106 --> 00:31:28,155
Two...

482
00:31:41,463 --> 00:31:42,545
Argh!

483
00:31:54,264 --> 00:31:56,723
I will never be like you, Dad.

484
00:31:57,562 --> 00:31:59,136
Enough!

485
00:31:59,138 --> 00:32:02,047
Good God, Hal.

486
00:32:02,049 --> 00:32:04,382
You can't be trusted to do anything.

487
00:32:04,384 --> 00:32:06,235
You were a terrible serial killer,

488
00:32:06,237 --> 00:32:07,978
and you still are today.

489
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,646
Useless.

490
00:32:26,737 --> 00:32:28,237
And what do you think you're doing?

491
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,898
Claiming our prize.

492
00:32:29,901 --> 00:32:31,677
We won, didn't we?

493
00:32:32,806 --> 00:32:34,046
We survived the night.

494
00:32:34,049 --> 00:32:36,169
We proved that we're
better than this town.

495
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:39,351
That may or may not be true.

496
00:32:41,129 --> 00:32:42,535
Kill them.

497
00:32:42,538 --> 00:32:44,181
Kill them all!

498
00:32:44,183 --> 00:32:45,441
Come on. Archie!

499
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:07,467
Archie!

500
00:33:09,675 --> 00:33:10,799
Take cover!

501
00:33:23,055 --> 00:33:24,146
Ronnie, here.

502
00:33:33,691 --> 00:33:35,658
Poisons, charge!

503
00:33:44,294 --> 00:33:45,417
All clear.

504
00:34:00,555 --> 00:34:02,000
Cheryl. Cheryl.

505
00:34:03,837 --> 00:34:06,046
Why aren't you at the
Farm? Where's my mom?

506
00:34:06,048 --> 00:34:08,840
She sprung me from that Jonestown-like
nightmare and told me to find you.

507
00:34:08,842 --> 00:34:10,267
Edgar was planning to ascend tonight.

508
00:34:10,269 --> 00:34:11,685
Oh, my God. We have to save her.

509
00:34:11,687 --> 00:34:12,769
Come aboard, cousin.

510
00:34:12,771 --> 00:34:13,913
Get in.

511
00:34:21,836 --> 00:34:22,955
Kevin.

512
00:34:25,209 --> 00:34:26,375
They left me.

513
00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:30,451
I wanted to go,

514
00:34:30,454 --> 00:34:33,876
but they said that someone had to
stay behind to explain what happened.

515
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:35,300
What did happen?

516
00:34:35,302 --> 00:34:38,411
The worthy ascended, of course.

517
00:34:38,413 --> 00:34:39,755
Who did?

518
00:34:39,757 --> 00:34:41,748
Where's my mom and Polly?

519
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,210
Gone.

520
00:34:43,213 --> 00:34:44,476
Everyone is.

521
00:34:45,563 --> 00:34:47,104
And we'll never see them again.

522
00:34:59,148 --> 00:35:01,453
The Gargoyle King.

523
00:35:01,456 --> 00:35:03,230
The Red Dahlia.

524
00:35:03,233 --> 00:35:05,080
The Black Hood.

525
00:35:06,024 --> 00:35:07,607
Chic was in jail.

526
00:35:07,609 --> 00:35:09,400
Hal Cooper was dead.

527
00:35:09,402 --> 00:35:11,253
Finally.

528
00:35:11,255 --> 00:35:13,738
Only Penelope Blossom
managed to slip away

529
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:14,965
into the night.

530
00:35:16,284 --> 00:35:19,400
Riverdale belonged to us again.

531
00:35:19,403 --> 00:35:22,204
A future was ours to write.

532
00:35:24,209 --> 00:35:26,185
But what would our stories be?

533
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,017
Welcome home, Jay-Jay.

534
00:35:47,533 --> 00:35:50,000
You're sure? How could
he have hid this from me?

535
00:35:50,002 --> 00:35:51,168
Hid what?

536
00:35:52,445 --> 00:35:53,754
I... I gotta go.

537
00:35:55,991 --> 00:35:58,449
Veronica, that was our attorney.

538
00:35:58,451 --> 00:36:00,418
What was Daddy hiding?

539
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,516
FBI!

540
00:36:02,122 --> 00:36:03,997
Hands up, now.

541
00:36:03,999 --> 00:36:05,290
Agent Ardilla?

542
00:36:05,292 --> 00:36:06,799
What the hell is going on?

543
00:36:06,802 --> 00:36:09,669
Hermione Lodge, you're under arrest
for conspiracy to commit murder.

544
00:36:09,671 --> 00:36:11,087
Your own husband's.

545
00:36:11,089 --> 00:36:12,388
Veronica, listen to me.

546
00:36:12,391 --> 00:36:15,892
It's going to be fine. Call
Sowerberry. Talk to him.

547
00:36:15,894 --> 00:36:17,974
- I love you, mija.
- I love you, too, Mom.

548
00:36:23,894 --> 00:36:25,778
Mr. Lodge, it's done.

549
00:36:28,148 --> 00:36:30,949
As requested, your wife's been arrested.

550
00:36:30,951 --> 00:36:33,111
And the necessary
evidence has been planted.

551
00:36:34,046 --> 00:36:35,645
Perfect.

552
00:36:35,648 --> 00:36:37,005
Thank you.

553
00:36:40,827 --> 00:36:45,305
Ah, Veronica, you don't even
know what's coming, mija.

554
00:36:51,922 --> 00:36:53,658
Can we take five?

555
00:36:53,661 --> 00:36:55,953
Yeah, sure, Red.

556
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,455
What's up?

557
00:37:02,457 --> 00:37:05,576
I've been thinking about making
some changes to this place, Mad Dog.

558
00:37:05,578 --> 00:37:07,694
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

559
00:37:07,696 --> 00:37:10,396
Maybe make it more than just a gym.

560
00:37:10,398 --> 00:37:13,069
Like a halfway house
or a community center.

561
00:37:13,072 --> 00:37:15,106
Place where the kids in
the neighborhood can come

562
00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:16,602
so they stay off the streets.

563
00:37:18,382 --> 00:37:19,864
I want you to help me run it.

564
00:37:19,866 --> 00:37:21,084
For real?

565
00:37:21,087 --> 00:37:23,243
We might actually have a shot
at turning this town around,

566
00:37:23,245 --> 00:37:24,219
give people hope again.

567
00:37:24,221 --> 00:37:25,296
Oh, yeah.

568
00:37:31,887 --> 00:37:33,128
Can I help you?

569
00:37:33,131 --> 00:37:34,538
Mr. Jones?

570
00:37:34,541 --> 00:37:36,255
I'm Agent Smith with the FBI.

571
00:37:36,258 --> 00:37:38,218
Is Betty Cooper here by any chance?

572
00:37:39,386 --> 00:37:40,977
Is this about the Lodges?

573
00:37:40,979 --> 00:37:43,488
No, it's about your mother.

574
00:37:44,687 --> 00:37:46,904
My team's been
investigating Edgar Evernever

575
00:37:46,907 --> 00:37:48,652
for quite some time now.

576
00:37:48,654 --> 00:37:50,320
We almost had him two towns ago.

577
00:37:50,322 --> 00:37:52,015
Well, what were you waiting for?

578
00:37:52,018 --> 00:37:55,532
He and his kooks took over The
Sisters of Quiet Mercy months ago.

579
00:37:55,535 --> 00:37:57,110
We had someone on the inside,

580
00:37:57,112 --> 00:37:59,112
someone tasked with
getting close to Edgar,

581
00:37:59,114 --> 00:38:00,589
gathering intel.

582
00:38:00,591 --> 00:38:02,214
We were waiting on her word.

583
00:38:03,835 --> 00:38:06,836
- "Her," you mean...
- Your mother.

584
00:38:06,838 --> 00:38:08,138
She's working with us.

585
00:38:11,268 --> 00:38:15,178
My mother? My mother
is an FBI informant?

586
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:18,423
She's been helping us build a case
against Edgar Evernever and his Farmies,

587
00:38:18,425 --> 00:38:19,808
their organ harvesting, all of it.

588
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:22,143
You knew about the organ harvesting.

589
00:38:22,145 --> 00:38:24,196
It's vital that we find your mom ASAP.

590
00:38:24,198 --> 00:38:27,140
Which is why my team and I are gonna
be setting up shop here in Riverdale

591
00:38:27,142 --> 00:38:29,693
until we can safely
locate and extract her.

592
00:38:29,695 --> 00:38:32,770
I mean, what... Is there
anything we can do to help?

593
00:38:32,772 --> 00:38:34,772
Thought you might ask.

594
00:38:34,774 --> 00:38:37,055
So you're quite the
detectives around these parts.

595
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:42,383
I'm sorry, this is gonna seem weird,

596
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:44,166
but do I... Do I know you?

597
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:50,714
As a matter of fact, yes.

598
00:38:50,716 --> 00:38:54,167
It's no coincidence that your
mother and I found each other.

599
00:38:54,169 --> 00:38:55,477
You see, um...

600
00:38:58,173 --> 00:39:00,897
I'm Charles, your brother.

601
00:39:07,232 --> 00:39:10,308
You... You can't be.

602
00:39:11,236 --> 00:39:12,244
Wait.

603
00:39:13,841 --> 00:39:16,250
If you're Charles...

604
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:18,690
You and I are also brothers, Jughead.

605
00:39:18,693 --> 00:39:19,822
That's right.

606
00:39:22,489 --> 00:39:24,581
Wait. Back up. Your brother's alive.

607
00:39:24,583 --> 00:39:25,924
And he's an FBI agent?

608
00:39:25,926 --> 00:39:27,992
It's our half-brother.

609
00:39:27,994 --> 00:39:29,660
And it's pretty crazy, right?

610
00:39:29,662 --> 00:39:32,681
Oh, and my mom is also
working for the FBI,

611
00:39:32,683 --> 00:39:34,257
undercover at the Farm.

612
00:39:34,259 --> 00:39:35,860
What?

613
00:39:35,863 --> 00:39:38,982
Actually, that kind of tracks.

614
00:39:38,985 --> 00:39:41,777
What about you, Vee?
Any word about your mom?

615
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,966
She's trying to cut a deal with the DA,

616
00:39:43,968 --> 00:39:47,362
but in the meantime,
Smithers is my legal guardian.

617
00:39:48,774 --> 00:39:50,157
Guys, let's make a vow.

618
00:39:51,535 --> 00:39:53,434
Another one.

619
00:39:53,436 --> 00:39:55,895
We've got senior year
ahead of us. Let's enjoy it.

620
00:39:55,897 --> 00:39:58,189
Let's vow to be done with death cults,

621
00:39:58,191 --> 00:40:01,376
and murder mysteries, and gremlins.

622
00:40:02,737 --> 00:40:04,280
It's gargoyles.

623
00:40:04,283 --> 00:40:08,635
Our senior year could be the last time
we're all together in the same place.

624
00:40:08,646 --> 00:40:10,962
And I don't want to
let anything ruin that.

625
00:40:14,707 --> 00:40:15,807
Agreed.

626
00:40:16,635 --> 00:40:17,893
I'm in.

627
00:40:17,895 --> 00:40:19,377
I'm so in.

628
00:40:19,379 --> 00:40:20,970
Me too.

629
00:40:20,972 --> 00:40:24,716
Well, it sounds a little dull, but sure.

630
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:26,403
Let's toast.

631
00:40:26,406 --> 00:40:27,877
To the future.

632
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:31,646
_

633
00:40:36,229 --> 00:40:37,287
Archie.

634
00:40:38,908 --> 00:40:39,948
Archie.

635
00:40:41,089 --> 00:40:42,167
Archie.

636
00:40:44,446 --> 00:40:46,406
- Are you listening to me?
- Yeah.

637
00:40:48,241 --> 00:40:49,758
We have to burn all of our clothes,

638
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,094
including Jughead's beanie.

639
00:40:52,096 --> 00:40:55,366
We'll wash off the blood
in the swimming hole.

640
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:57,815
After tonight,

641
00:40:57,818 --> 00:41:00,510
we never speak of this, ever.

642
00:41:00,512 --> 00:41:03,167
Not to each other, not to our parents.

643
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:05,131
No one.

644
00:41:05,134 --> 00:41:07,609
We finish our senior year and graduate,

645
00:41:07,611 --> 00:41:09,302
and we'll go our separate ways.

646
00:41:09,304 --> 00:41:11,780
That is the only way
that we won't get caught.

647
00:41:17,454 --> 00:41:18,599
Do it.

648
00:41:36,122 --> 00:41:37,305
Friends forever.

649
00:41:38,642 --> 00:41:40,058
Friends forever.
