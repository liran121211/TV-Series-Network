Betty, the fact that
our parents played G&G

65
00:03:13,907 --> 00:03:16,007

I've come to believe,

00:03:16,743 --> 00:03:20,878
that we have been playing this
game for a lot longer than we know.

67
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,048

it, the Hot Dog rescue,

If not warring tribes, might as
well call us orcs and goblins.

71
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:33,591
Okay, you're not making any sense

72
00:03:33,593 --> 00:03:35,927
and you're also not listening
to anything that I'm saying.

73
00:03:35,929 --> 00:03:41,165
We have nine suspects that

00:03:50,243 --> 00:03:52,543

The whole game is an
analog for Riverdale.

79
00:03:55,215 --> 00:03:57,515
The game only exists in Riverdale.

80

me the missing piece.

Cassidy Bullock's murder on me?

ones that were with him that night,

you pull the trigger.

380
