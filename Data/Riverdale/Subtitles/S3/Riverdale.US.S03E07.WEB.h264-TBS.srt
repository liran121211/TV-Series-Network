1
00:00:01,769 --> 00:00:02,826
<i> Previously</i>
<i>on</i> Riverdale...

2
00:00:02,903 --> 00:00:04,369
So, my dad played G&G
in high school.

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,371
<i>All of our parents did.</i>

4
00:00:06,382 --> 00:00:08,090
- What's that, Hiram?
- Fizzle Rocks.

5
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:11,710
<i> This house is</i>
<i>no longer safe.</i>

6
00:00:11,787 --> 00:00:12,919
They'll watch over you now.

7
00:00:12,996 --> 00:00:14,746
Mom! Are you out of your mind?

8
00:00:14,824 --> 00:00:16,598
<i> You're safe with the
Sisters of Quiet Mercy.</i>

9
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:19,301
Framing Archie for murder?

10
00:00:19,377 --> 00:00:21,511
Conspiring to keep him
locked away?

11
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:24,732
<i>An old-fashioned prison break
might be your best option.</i>

12
00:00:24,808 --> 00:00:27,142
<i> You're breaking</i>
<i>Archie out of juvie?</i>

13
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:29,135
<i> Ten thousand apiece.</i>
<i>All you have to say is</i>

14
00:00:29,213 --> 00:00:31,855
<i>that you saw Archie Andrews kill
your friend Cassidy Bullock.</i>

15
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:34,816
Your henchman, Minetta,
is going down.

16
00:00:34,893 --> 00:00:37,360
You know, if you added a
couple of slots, table games,

17
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:39,488
you'd have quite
the little goldmine.

18
00:00:39,564 --> 00:00:42,032
<i> Hiram Lodge has done
everything in his power to destroy me.</i>

19
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:43,784
I don't think I can
go back to Riverdale.

20
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,328
- I'm not letting you go off alone.
- I'm not alone.

21
00:00:46,404 --> 00:00:47,629
<i> Leaving is</i>
<i>my best option, Jug.</i>

22
00:00:55,506 --> 00:00:59,099
<i> The two young men</i>
<i>had been walking for days.</i>

23
00:00:59,176 --> 00:01:02,436
<i>Looking at them, you might
think they were brothers.</i>

24
00:01:02,513 --> 00:01:05,064
<i>And in a way they were.</i>

25
00:01:06,591 --> 00:01:08,100
<i>Brothers.</i>

26
00:01:08,176 --> 00:01:12,029
<i>Fearful that Hiram Lodge
might catch up to them.</i>

27
00:01:15,058 --> 00:01:17,442
<i>Hi, this is Betty.
Leave a message.</i>

28
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:19,119
- -
Hey, Betty, it's me.

29
00:01:19,196 --> 00:01:21,038
I'm just trying you again,

30
00:01:22,032 --> 00:01:23,273
hoping you're okay.

31
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,792
We're just looking
for a place to settle down.

32
00:01:24,868 --> 00:01:27,619
I'll let you know
when we do. Okay. Uh...

33
00:01:27,696 --> 00:01:29,671
I love you. Bye.

34
00:01:31,199 --> 00:01:32,390
Still no answer?

35
00:01:34,878 --> 00:01:37,012
Look, Jug,
maybe you should go back.

36
00:01:38,915 --> 00:01:40,882
I'm fine.

37
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:42,810
Really, dude,
I'm gonna be fine.

38
00:01:42,886 --> 00:01:46,930
Archie, no offense, but Betty took
down a serial killer last year.

39
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:48,631
You can't go for five minutes

40
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:51,184
without being kidnapped or getting
the crap kicked out of you.

41
00:01:51,261 --> 00:01:54,146
That was before you were marked
for death by Hiram Lodge.

42
00:01:54,222 --> 00:01:56,648
It would be nice to stop
looking over my shoulder all the time,

43
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:59,076
- just find somewhere to
settle, you know? -We will.

44
00:02:00,312 --> 00:02:01,319
When we find the right place,

45
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,538
we'll know.
We're gonna feel it.

46
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:05,040
Or maybe we're already there.

47
00:02:11,448 --> 00:02:14,291
Nice try. Let's get a couple
more miles in before nightfall.

48
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:16,093
Come on, Jug. We gotta bunk somewhere.

49
00:02:37,774 --> 00:02:39,533
You're trespassing.

50
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:42,494
Now, let's see you do
a little turn, nice and slow.

51
00:02:57,961 --> 00:02:59,586
Who are you?

52
00:02:59,663 --> 00:03:01,221
I'm Cal. This is Biff.

53
00:03:01,998 --> 00:03:03,015
From Centerville.

54
00:03:05,636 --> 00:03:07,227
I don't like liars.

55
00:03:07,304 --> 00:03:08,386
Shoot 'em, Gracie.

56
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:09,638
Wait! Wait.

57
00:03:09,714 --> 00:03:11,231
We got robbed on a train.

58
00:03:11,308 --> 00:03:14,559
They took all our money. We've
been walking for days. Just...

59
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,612
We're looking for some food and some
water, and we'll be on our way.

60
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:19,406
Put the rifle down.

61
00:03:19,483 --> 00:03:21,241
- I don't trust them.
- Do as I say.

62
00:03:25,814 --> 00:03:27,206
I'm Laurie Lake.
This is Gracie.

63
00:03:28,918 --> 00:03:30,125
You boys like stew?

64
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:40,886
So, where's everyone else?

65
00:03:44,207 --> 00:03:45,840
I only meant

66
00:03:45,917 --> 00:03:48,268
a farm this size, I thought there
would be more people working it.

67
00:03:48,345 --> 00:03:51,721
A lot of the men in town are
at a job down the river.

68
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:54,650
Our father and our brother went with them,
but they come back every now and then.

69
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,228
You guys have somewhere
to stay for the night?

70
00:03:58,305 --> 00:03:59,338
- We're good.
- No.

71
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,400
We should be
getting out of your hair.

72
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:05,786
Or you could stay the night, if you
don't mind sleeping in the barn.

73
00:04:05,862 --> 00:04:08,121
That would be amazing. Is there
anything we can do to repay you?

74
00:04:08,198 --> 00:04:10,165
Just some farm work.

75
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:13,252
I have some bales of hay
I need to move.

76
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:15,879
Just stay
out of the main house.

77
00:04:20,877 --> 00:04:21,993
Dude, we can't stay here.

78
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:23,712
One night, Jug.
What's the problem?

79
00:04:23,788 --> 00:04:27,757
I don't now. Something about
this place weirds me out.

80
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,601
It's a little too American
Gothic, even for me.

81
00:04:30,962 --> 00:04:34,139
You're right.
Where is everybody?

82
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:35,974
And when I asked her what
her dad and her brother did,

83
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:37,642
didn't it seem
like she was lying to us?

84
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:39,361
You mean, like we are, Cal?

85
00:04:40,564 --> 00:04:41,530
Am I interrupting?

86
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:45,325
Nope. Not at all.

87
00:04:45,402 --> 00:04:48,203
I brought some extra blankets in case you
guys get cold in the middle of the night.

88
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:51,415
Oh, thank you, Laurie.

89
00:04:56,747 --> 00:04:57,713
All right.

90
00:04:59,249 --> 00:05:00,215
See you tomorrow.

91
00:05:01,659 --> 00:05:02,592
Good night.

92
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:07,889
- Seriously?
- What?

93
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:11,226
We have to stay on task.
No distractions.

94
00:05:13,263 --> 00:05:14,604
I totally agree.

95
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,982
No distractions.

96
00:05:25,609 --> 00:05:26,825
Hey.

97
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:30,704
You missed eggs
and bacon for breakfast.

98
00:05:30,781 --> 00:05:34,366
Meanwhile, you are
literally moving bales of hay.

99
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:36,326
Yup.

100
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:38,161
Feel free
to help out, too, Jug.

101
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:39,704
Actually, I was gonna head
into town for a little bit

102
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:41,298
and take some pictures
before we hit the road.

103
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:43,675
Remember?

104
00:05:43,752 --> 00:05:44,718
Like we said we would.

105
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:47,754
Are you gonna be okay here?

106
00:05:47,831 --> 00:05:49,222
I think I'll be fine, Jug.

107
00:06:48,191 --> 00:06:49,157
Excuse me?

108
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:55,747
Excuse me?

109
00:06:56,357 --> 00:06:57,290
Hi.

110
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:00,919
I'm... I'm a little lost.

111
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:09,085
I saw some strange symbols
on the sides of the buildings.

112
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,179
They didn't look as faded as the rest.
You know what they mean?

113
00:07:13,049 --> 00:07:16,092
The town wasn't
always like this.

114
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,553
First, it was
the Jingle-Jangle.

115
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:21,681
Now we're back
to Fizzle Rocks.

116
00:07:21,758 --> 00:07:23,766
Fizzle Rocks?

117
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:26,278
Like the candy I used to eat
back when I was a kid?

118
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:30,273
That's normal Fizzle Rocks.

119
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:34,119
What we got nowadays is
laced with drugs.

120
00:07:36,147 --> 00:07:37,780
As for them symbols,

121
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:39,574
they started
showing up in town

122
00:07:39,651 --> 00:07:44,171
about the same time
Fizzle Rocks trickled in.

123
00:07:44,247 --> 00:07:47,081
You've already done so much for me,
you don't have to do this too.

124
00:07:47,158 --> 00:07:48,708
I used to do this
for my father.

125
00:07:48,785 --> 00:07:50,427
And you did move all that hay.

126
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:52,721
My dad's
a construction worker,

127
00:07:53,665 --> 00:07:55,632
so I'm used to physical labor.

128
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,727
Well, there's a lot of that
around here.

129
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:03,982
If you and your friend want to
stick around for a few days.

130
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:07,986
I'm not sure about Cal,

131
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,888
but I would be, I think.

132
00:08:12,609 --> 00:08:15,535
There's something about this place
that just makes me feel at home.

133
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,038
I don't know why.

134
00:08:38,802 --> 00:08:40,268
I'm sorry, Laurie.

135
00:08:42,046 --> 00:08:43,813
I just... I can't
do this right now.

136
00:08:48,311 --> 00:08:49,611
There's a girl back home.

137
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,815
There always is.

138
00:08:53,891 --> 00:08:56,317
Even though we're not together
anymore, I still love her.

139
00:08:56,394 --> 00:08:58,370
If you love her, Biff,
then why are you here?

140
00:09:02,993 --> 00:09:04,125
Because of her father.

141
00:09:05,403 --> 00:09:06,461
And my past with him.

142
00:09:09,499 --> 00:09:11,207
Sometimes, when you're
trying to survive,

143
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:12,968
it's easy to lose sight
of who you are.

144
00:09:19,843 --> 00:09:21,059
Laurie, my name's not Biff.

145
00:09:23,346 --> 00:09:25,522
It's Archie Andrews.

146
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:27,599
And I'm from a small town
called Riverdale,

147
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:28,891
which I can't go back to.

148
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:29,901
Because of your girl's father?

149
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,072
Hiram Lodge, yes.

150
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:37,826
I'm sorry
I lied to you.

151
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:40,161
It's okay.

152
00:09:41,197 --> 00:09:42,947
Archie Andrews.

153
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,000
Around here everybody's
running from something.

154
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,253
Let me see
about getting you some lunch.

155
00:10:32,115 --> 00:10:33,048
Are you a King?

156
00:10:34,117 --> 00:10:35,342
I'm actually a Game Master.

157
00:10:36,619 --> 00:10:38,294
I started as a Hellcaster,
just like you.

158
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:39,888
- What level?
- I was three.

159
00:10:40,623 --> 00:10:42,507
On my way to four.

160
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:43,742
Where did
you guys learn to play?

161
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:44,726
Our older brothers
used to play,

162
00:10:45,461 --> 00:10:46,803
before they left town.

163
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,855
Yeah. I noticed that
there are no men here.

164
00:10:48,932 --> 00:10:50,973
- All gone to work building a prison.
- Prison?

165
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,351
My brother told me
it's not just for prisoners.

166
00:10:53,428 --> 00:10:55,695
It's for making
Fizzle Rocks, too.

167
00:10:55,772 --> 00:10:57,897
So, the prison doubles
as a drug lab?

168
00:10:57,974 --> 00:10:59,407
Where are you shackin' up,
Game Master?

169
00:11:00,944 --> 00:11:02,702
Uh... Lake Farm.

170
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:04,654
Ugh. Gracie's house?

171
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:05,955
We used
to be friends with her.

172
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,740
Always acting like she's
too good for everybody,

173
00:11:07,817 --> 00:11:09,959
even though her daddy works for
the Man in Black like ours do.

174
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:14,414
- Who's the Man in Black? -
He's always in a black suit.

175
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:15,924
He gets driven around
in a black car.

176
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:18,927
This town's his now.

177
00:11:19,996 --> 00:11:21,054
Hiram.

178
00:11:26,502 --> 00:11:28,770
I made you some more eggs,
I hope you don't mind.

179
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:32,390
No, that is more than okay.
Thank you.

180
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:34,567
You don't have to thank me.
You helped me with the hay,

181
00:11:34,644 --> 00:11:36,602
and you helped me pass
the time a little bit quicker.

182
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:39,656
So, in my book, we're even.

183
00:11:43,728 --> 00:11:44,786
These are delicious.

184
00:12:37,949 --> 00:12:39,299
Are you all right?

185
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:40,467
Come on, let's get you out of here.

186
00:12:41,953 --> 00:12:43,586
Laurie knocked me out.
Where the hell is she?

187
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:45,764
She's inside,
with Hiram Lodge.

188
00:12:46,457 --> 00:12:47,390
What?

189
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,260
I don't understand. How do
the girls even know him?

190
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,763
Shh. I think her dad
and her brother work for him.

191
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,097
They make drugs
inside the prison,

192
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,391
which all the kids take
when they play G&G.

193
00:12:57,468 --> 00:12:58,684
All of this is
connected, Archie.

194
00:12:58,761 --> 00:13:00,353
Hiram owns this whole town,

195
00:13:00,429 --> 00:13:01,905
and probably many others
just like it. Let's go.

196
00:13:02,974 --> 00:13:04,007
Or we could stay and fight.

197
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:08,411
- No, Archie.
- This is our one chance

198
00:13:09,405 --> 00:13:10,805
to take it all back.

199
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,951
Hiram is gonna walk in here
thinking that I'm tied up.

200
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:16,619
Let's surprise him
and take him out.

201
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:18,021
That's a bad idea, trust me.

202
00:13:18,023 --> 00:13:18,988
There's gotta be something
in here we could use,

203
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:21,174
- a pitchfork.
- Hey, look at me.

204
00:13:21,251 --> 00:13:24,052
You're not thinking clearly. It's two
against four. And they have guns.

205
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,471
I get how bad you want this.

206
00:13:26,548 --> 00:13:28,089
But we are under-prepared.

207
00:13:28,165 --> 00:13:29,924
They're going to kill us.
Archie. Archie!

208
00:13:30,001 --> 00:13:31,184
Look at me.

209
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,896
- Hey. Don't say what I think
you're going to say. -Jughead!

210
00:13:35,765 --> 00:13:36,773
I can kill him.

211
00:13:41,104 --> 00:13:42,612
- I can.
- I know.

212
00:13:43,681 --> 00:13:45,147
But right now,

213
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:47,608
we've gotta go
while we still have time.

214
00:13:47,685 --> 00:13:49,035
There's nowhere
he won't follow me.

215
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:51,663
I can't run from him.

216
00:13:55,118 --> 00:13:57,201
Just let me end this nightmare
once and for all.

217
00:14:00,156 --> 00:14:01,998
He's coming.

218
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:03,716
Archie, I know
he's ruined your life.

219
00:14:03,793 --> 00:14:05,459
He's ruined a lot of lives.

220
00:14:05,536 --> 00:14:08,087
But one day, he's going to get
everything he deserves. I swear.

221
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:09,556
But it's not today.
It's not right now.

222
00:14:09,632 --> 00:14:10,932
- Okay? We have to go.
- Jughead...

223
00:14:12,376 --> 00:14:14,561
All right, if you do this,
if you kill him,

224
00:14:15,671 --> 00:14:16,980
will Veronica
ever forgive you?

225
00:14:21,636 --> 00:14:23,736
Before I let you in,
to be clear--

226
00:14:23,813 --> 00:14:27,315
Yes. Yes. Archie in exchange
for your brother and father,

227
00:14:27,391 --> 00:14:30,326
their debt to me will be paid.
You have my word.

228
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,381
What the hell is
going on here?

229
00:14:46,669 --> 00:14:48,303
Where is he?

230
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:00,999
You know,
for a second back there,

231
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:02,609
I didn't think
you were gonna listen to me.

232
00:15:02,685 --> 00:15:03,651
Neither did I, Jug.

233
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,487
Neither did I.

234
00:15:08,024 --> 00:15:09,449
You were right
about one thing though.

235
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:12,401
Hiram's gonna follow you,

236
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,287
or us, wherever we go.

237
00:15:14,364 --> 00:15:15,955
We're always gonna be
outnumbered and outgunned.

238
00:15:18,034 --> 00:15:19,042
So, what's the plan?

239
00:15:22,538 --> 00:15:23,546
We'll go see my mom.

240
00:15:26,784 --> 00:15:27,967
You sure we should do that?

241
00:15:29,787 --> 00:15:30,720
Got a better idea?

242
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:45,267
What are you doing?

243
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:46,486
I'm leaving the Pembrooke.

244
00:15:52,101 --> 00:15:53,159
Veronica.

245
00:15:54,737 --> 00:15:56,996
I realize that
you're upset about Archie,

246
00:15:57,073 --> 00:15:58,831
but you can't just
go running after him.

247
00:15:58,908 --> 00:16:02,076
Save your breath, Mom.
I'm not going after Archie.

248
00:16:02,153 --> 00:16:03,920
Okay. Then what's
this all about?

249
00:16:08,876 --> 00:16:10,593
Convenient, isn't it?

250
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,844
Sheriff Minetta goes missing

251
00:16:11,921 --> 00:16:13,738
just as I find
ironclad evidence

252
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,882
that he coerced those Shadow Lake
boys into giving false testimony.

253
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,260
Minetta was a corrupt man.

254
00:16:19,336 --> 00:16:20,928
He had many enemies.

255
00:16:21,005 --> 00:16:22,271
Is that a murder confession?

256
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:27,810
Okay. Veronica,

257
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:30,863
first of all,
I sincerely hope that

258
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,314
you don't believe
I'm capable of--

259
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,775
I honestly don't know
what to believe anymore.

260
00:16:34,852 --> 00:16:37,912
Which is why I'm leaving this house
of horrors while I still can.

261
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:42,825
Maybe you should too.

262
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:44,435
He's my husband.

263
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:47,329
Right. Well, you and Daddy can
pop open a bottle of Cristal

264
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,031
because he finally did it.

265
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:52,135
He finally won. He finally drove
Archie and me away for good.

266
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:18,286
It's not the Five Seasons,
but it'll do.

267
00:17:48,226 --> 00:17:50,267
- Morning, Pop.
- Veronica.

268
00:17:50,344 --> 00:17:52,394
You're in early.
What time did you get here?

269
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,906
You know what they say
about the bird and the worm.

270
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:13,341
What's up, Ronnie?

271
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:17,670
Still bummed about Archie
bailing on the world?

272
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,680
That's on my list
of woes, yes.

273
00:18:20,749 --> 00:18:21,682
What else?

274
00:18:24,128 --> 00:18:26,554
We work all day and all night,

275
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,481
and yet we're
barely scraping by.

276
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:30,391
The numbers
just aren't adding up.

277
00:18:30,467 --> 00:18:33,152
It may not be
the Copacabana yet,

278
00:18:33,229 --> 00:18:36,823
but business is steady.

279
00:18:36,899 --> 00:18:39,483
One thing I learned
from my father

280
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:43,612
is that steady is one bad
week away from broke.

281
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:46,165
We'll never turn a profit
selling five-dollar mocktails

282
00:18:46,242 --> 00:18:48,701
to high schoolers
who sit here all day

283
00:18:48,777 --> 00:18:50,586
playing some
stupid board game.

284
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,373
So, what you're saying is

285
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,883
we need
to start a side hustle.

286
00:18:58,921 --> 00:19:02,423
So, now you want to turn
your speakeasy into a casino?

287
00:19:02,499 --> 00:19:04,091
For one night only.

288
00:19:04,168 --> 00:19:05,685
You yourself suggested it.

289
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:08,762
And I've done my research.

290
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:14,143
I've heard all about your very
exclusive blackjack club in the city.

291
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:18,105
So, I thought, "Who better to show
me the ropes than Mr. 21 himself"?

292
00:19:18,182 --> 00:19:19,157
What's the deal on the table?

293
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:23,611
If you agree
to provide me with some games,

294
00:19:23,687 --> 00:19:27,114
and if you bring some
of your high-roller friends

295
00:19:27,191 --> 00:19:28,824
who are guaranteed to play,

296
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,751
I'll give you 10%
of the proceeds.

297
00:19:31,362 --> 00:19:32,786
Fifty.

298
00:19:32,863 --> 00:19:34,088
- Twenty.
- Thirty.

299
00:19:34,165 --> 00:19:36,290
Twenty-five.

300
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:40,553
And that money will be
all yours, Elio.

301
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:44,640
Come on. Everything you do is
in your father's shadow.

302
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:47,218
Don't you wanna step out
on your own, finally?

303
00:19:47,294 --> 00:19:48,728
How are you gonna
cover expenses?

304
00:19:48,804 --> 00:19:50,804
The house always wins, right?

305
00:19:50,881 --> 00:19:52,473
I'm counting on that
to be the case here.

306
00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:54,850
But in terms of startup costs,

307
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:57,069
should the unthinkable happen,

308
00:19:57,146 --> 00:19:59,405
I took out a second mortgage
against Pop's.

309
00:19:59,482 --> 00:20:00,940
A gambler.

310
00:20:01,016 --> 00:20:02,683
I like it. I'm in.

311
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:09,031
And, Elio, do me a favor. Let's
keep this arrangement between us.

312
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:12,001
I don't want any third-parties sticking
their noses into our business.

313
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:24,180
Nice uniform.

314
00:20:25,508 --> 00:20:26,882
What are you doing here?

315
00:20:26,884 --> 00:20:28,809
I'll take
a<i> cafe con leche,</i> please.

316
00:20:33,757 --> 00:20:34,732
Anything else?

317
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:38,319
Your mother's
worried about you.

318
00:20:39,522 --> 00:20:41,063
As am I.

319
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,398
We both know
you've been struggling

320
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:43,574
ever since
Archie abandoned you.

321
00:20:47,863 --> 00:20:49,288
I also heard
through the grapevine

322
00:20:49,365 --> 00:20:50,498
that you're hosting
a casino night.

323
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:54,660
- So?
- So?

324
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:56,870
Instead of coming to me
for advice and help,

325
00:20:56,947 --> 00:20:58,831
you went
to one of our competitors?

326
00:20:58,907 --> 00:21:00,749
It's ironic,
for all your high talk

327
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:02,509
on wanting
a legitimate business,

328
00:21:02,587 --> 00:21:05,254
you're now inviting a bunch of
criminals over to play cards?

329
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:06,755
Times must be tough.

330
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:10,009
They're not criminals.
They're Elio's friends.

331
00:21:10,085 --> 00:21:13,813
And how do you think Elio's family
built their gambling empire?

332
00:21:13,889 --> 00:21:16,807
They're cheaters.
And criminals.

333
00:21:16,884 --> 00:21:18,475
And they're gonna
rob you blind.

334
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:20,486
Yeah. Well, you would know
all about that, wouldn't you?

335
00:21:21,764 --> 00:21:22,822
Are you angry about something?

336
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:27,034
Am I angry?

337
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:30,329
You drove Archie away.

338
00:21:30,406 --> 00:21:34,158
Did I? I swear I read in the papers
that he was cleared on all charges.

339
00:21:34,234 --> 00:21:37,878
So you just came here to
twist the knife, is that it?

340
00:21:38,781 --> 00:21:40,881
No.

341
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:43,917
I came here to remind you
who your true allies are.

342
00:21:43,994 --> 00:21:45,803
Your mother and I,
we're still here for you,

343
00:21:47,247 --> 00:21:49,348
to welcome you back
with open arms,

344
00:21:49,425 --> 00:21:51,133
because we're family.

345
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,185
And that will never change.

346
00:21:53,262 --> 00:21:54,353
Get out, Daddy.

347
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:21,288
Your drink, Ms. Lodge.
Just how you like it.

348
00:22:21,365 --> 00:22:22,465
Perfect. Thank you.

349
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:29,805
Veronica.

350
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:36,395
See, Reggie. This is
exactly what we needed.

351
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,723
Thanks to Elio,

352
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,567
we're gonna pull in bank.

353
00:22:41,644 --> 00:22:43,611
Yeah. Or he's gonna break it.

354
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:46,146
What do you mean?

355
00:22:46,223 --> 00:22:49,066
Your generous friend Elio is
on a hot streak.

356
00:22:49,143 --> 00:22:51,068
He hasn't lost
a single hand all night.

357
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:52,528
He's gonna wipe us out.

358
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:53,654
We're gonna be bankrupt.

359
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,289
I thought
the house always wins.

360
00:22:56,233 --> 00:22:57,324
How is this happening?

361
00:22:57,401 --> 00:22:58,742
He's gotta be cheating.

362
00:22:58,819 --> 00:23:01,003
I'm not surprised,
'cause my father said

363
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,997
Elio's a criminal
from a family of criminals.

364
00:23:04,074 --> 00:23:05,874
Want me to rough him up?
Throw him out?

365
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:07,543
No.

366
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:09,002
That's not
how we do things here.

367
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:11,263
Especially not to a member
of a crime family.

368
00:23:12,174 --> 00:23:13,674
But don't worry, Reggie.

369
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,268
Veronica Lodge is not about
to go quietly into the night.

370
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:19,939
- Dealer bust.
- Yes.

371
00:23:25,521 --> 00:23:28,480
Hey, Elio. Big night?

372
00:23:28,557 --> 00:23:30,399
I've never had
such a run of luck.

373
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:32,243
Hope this doesn't put
a huge dent in your take.

374
00:23:34,029 --> 00:23:35,287
You mean our take?

375
00:23:35,364 --> 00:23:38,165
Well, it seems like
either way, I win.

376
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:43,629
Do yourself a favor,

377
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:46,373
cash out.

378
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:48,959
And walk away
while you still can.

379
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:52,304
Or what? You'll call
your father for backup?

380
00:23:52,381 --> 00:23:53,722
I heard you weren't
even on speaking terms.

381
00:24:05,394 --> 00:24:06,360
Deal me in.

382
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:11,064
- What are you doing?
- Raising the stakes.

383
00:24:11,141 --> 00:24:14,535
One hand of blackjack, winner takes all.
Just you and me.

384
00:24:16,813 --> 00:24:17,746
What am I playing for?

385
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,000
This.

386
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:22,993
The deed to Pop's.

387
00:24:24,246 --> 00:24:26,505
And, by extension,

388
00:24:26,582 --> 00:24:28,048
La Bonne Nuit.

389
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:31,177
Fine. You asked for it.

390
00:24:32,329 --> 00:24:33,387
Let's play.

391
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,354
Twenty.

392
00:24:45,842 --> 00:24:48,644
Nineteen.

393
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,647
I'll tell you what, you'll always
be welcome at my speakeasy.

394
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:54,149
I might even
rename it "Veronica's."

395
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:55,859
The game's not over yet.

396
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:58,037
Trust me, princess.
It's over.

397
00:24:59,281 --> 00:25:00,247
Hit me.

398
00:25:07,957 --> 00:25:10,090
Twenty-one.

399
00:25:13,495 --> 00:25:15,003
Ms. Lodge wins.

400
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:18,382
That... That's impossible.

401
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:22,269
Why, Elio?
The house always wins.

402
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:24,146
Isn't that what they say?

403
00:25:36,652 --> 00:25:39,119
You made some serious coin, V.

404
00:25:39,655 --> 00:25:41,405
We did.

405
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:43,156
We're in the black, Reggie.

406
00:25:43,233 --> 00:25:45,033
It was
a very successful night.

407
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,586
Hmm. You could
have lost it all,

408
00:25:47,663 --> 00:25:51,164
you know? But you didn't.
You pulled it off.

409
00:25:51,241 --> 00:25:53,625
I swear, I thought
Elio was cheating.

410
00:25:53,702 --> 00:25:54,635
Can you keep a secret?

411
00:25:55,504 --> 00:25:57,429
Mmm-hmm.

412
00:25:57,506 --> 00:26:01,466
A couple of hours before we
opened the doors to casino night,

413
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:04,011
my father summoned me
to his study.

414
00:26:04,087 --> 00:26:05,479
What is it, Daddy?

415
00:26:05,556 --> 00:26:06,939
You said you had some important
news to share with me,

416
00:26:07,016 --> 00:26:08,515
and I'm on a bit
of a time crunch.

417
00:26:08,592 --> 00:26:10,601
Some business associates
have informed me

418
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:15,689
that your friend Elio has nefarious
intentions going into your casino night.

419
00:26:15,766 --> 00:26:16,824
Something you're not aware of.

420
00:26:17,726 --> 00:26:19,526
Like what?

421
00:26:19,603 --> 00:26:22,571
Like he's planning on fleecing you
because he thinks you're weak.

422
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:24,498
Because you're no longer
under my protection.

423
00:26:26,869 --> 00:26:27,835
Okay.

424
00:26:28,612 --> 00:26:30,162
Say I believe you,

425
00:26:30,238 --> 00:26:32,497
what would you suggest I do?

426
00:26:32,574 --> 00:26:34,124
<i> You beat him</i>
<i>at his own game.</i>

427
00:26:34,135 --> 00:26:37,085
<i>Like his father,
Elio is a compulsive gambler.</i>

428
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:39,379
<i>The bigger the pot, the more
he wants to stay in the game.</i>

429
00:26:39,456 --> 00:26:42,641
<i>The best way to beat players like
this is fast, with no remorse.</i>

430
00:26:42,718 --> 00:26:44,092
<i>One hand, winner takes all.</i>

431
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:45,794
<i>The deck's stacked
in your favor.</i>

432
00:26:45,871 --> 00:26:48,647
<i> The deck's stacked.</i>
<i>Wait, so you want me to cheat?</i>

433
00:26:48,724 --> 00:26:50,816
<i> It doesn't matter</i>
<i>how you win,</i> mija,

434
00:26:50,893 --> 00:26:53,152
<i>so long as you're
the last man standing.</i>

435
00:26:53,228 --> 00:26:55,937
<i>Now, I have the name of a dealer
you might want to bring in.</i>

436
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:56,989
<i>Johnny Goldwater.</i>

437
00:26:58,183 --> 00:26:59,366
<i>He's got nimble fingers.</i>

438
00:27:01,728 --> 00:27:04,246
Twenty-one.

439
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:09,034
Wow!

440
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:11,003
So, you scammed the scammer.

441
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,006
Oh, Reginald,
it doesn't matter how you win,

442
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:15,758
so long as you're
the last woman standing.

443
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:24,350
Was it a good night?

444
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:28,512
Yes. It was excellent.

445
00:27:28,588 --> 00:27:32,099
You know, this place has been
in my family for generations.

446
00:27:32,175 --> 00:27:34,068
It's a family place, at heart.

447
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,153
Crime-free.

448
00:27:37,305 --> 00:27:39,406
Pop.

449
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:45,278
The speakeasy wasn't making enough money.
And neither was the diner.

450
00:27:45,355 --> 00:27:46,997
So, I had to take a big swing.

451
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,574
Bend the rules a bit.

452
00:27:49,651 --> 00:27:51,101
Please.

453
00:27:51,103 --> 00:27:55,038
For your own sake, Veronica,
don't be like your father.

454
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:56,840
Pop, deep, deep down,

455
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,260
maybe my dad's not so bad.

456
00:28:00,337 --> 00:28:01,679
You haven't heard
the news yet, have you?

457
00:28:03,498 --> 00:28:07,050
Sheriff Minetta's body was
found in the marsh last night.

458
00:28:07,061 --> 00:28:08,894
At least they think
it was his body.

459
00:28:10,305 --> 00:28:13,190
They don't know for sure
'cause it was decapitated.

460
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:15,859
And the hands were sawed off.

461
00:28:25,112 --> 00:28:28,080
<i> Make them think</i>
<i>that you're sane.</i>

462
00:28:28,157 --> 00:28:29,623
Tell me
what you see, Elizabeth.

463
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:34,920
<i> A dead body,</i>
<i>you idiot.</i>

464
00:28:34,997 --> 00:28:36,422
I see a toy.

465
00:28:36,498 --> 00:28:38,215
A teddy bear with a bow tie.

466
00:28:39,868 --> 00:28:41,093
<i> Just pass this test,</i>

467
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:43,128
<i>and then you can
start investigating.</i>

468
00:28:43,205 --> 00:28:44,304
And what
do you see now?

469
00:28:47,209 --> 00:28:48,142
<i> The Black Hood.</i>

470
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:50,811
A butterfly.

471
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,138
A Monarch butterfly.

472
00:28:53,215 --> 00:28:54,148
Hmm.

473
00:28:59,387 --> 00:29:01,313
And now?

474
00:29:01,389 --> 00:29:02,781
<i> Remember</i>
<i>to smile, Betty,</i>

475
00:29:02,858 --> 00:29:05,776
<i>and you'll be
out of here in no time.</i>

476
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:09,529
The old jungle-gym
at Riverdale Elementary.

477
00:29:09,606 --> 00:29:11,749
I used to play on it
every recess.

478
00:29:14,194 --> 00:29:16,462
Very interesting.

479
00:29:16,538 --> 00:29:19,631
Step forward, Nellie.
It's time for your candy.

480
00:29:19,708 --> 00:29:21,958
<i> My mom</i>
<i>and her delusions.</i>

481
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:24,294
<i>She has a fondness
for this place.</i>

482
00:29:24,305 --> 00:29:26,963
<i>She thought the sisters would
keep me safe</i>

483
00:29:26,974 --> 00:29:29,457
<i>from the Gargoyle King.</i>

484
00:29:29,535 --> 00:29:33,520
<i>She probably didn't realize she was sending
me right into the belly of the beast.</i>

485
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:37,766
- What is this?
- A treat.

486
00:29:37,843 --> 00:29:40,360
Every patient gets candy
for good behavior.

487
00:29:42,597 --> 00:29:43,897
<i> Fizzle Rocks.</i>

488
00:29:43,974 --> 00:29:45,774
<i>AKA, drugs.</i>

489
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:47,692
<i>Why are
the sisters dosing us up</i>

490
00:29:47,769 --> 00:29:49,995
<i>with the same stuff
the Midnight Club took</i>

491
00:29:50,072 --> 00:29:52,331
<i>the night of Principal
Featherhead's murder?</i>

492
00:29:53,942 --> 00:29:54,875
Thank you so much.

493
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:57,953
Bless you, my child.

494
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:00,672
<i> And what-oh-what</i>
<i>is in that file, I wonder?</i>

495
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:15,062
How are
you settling in, roomie?

496
00:30:16,098 --> 00:30:17,064
Ethel.

497
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:19,850
What are you doing here?

498
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,601
Sister Woodhouse thought
that you might benefit

499
00:30:21,678 --> 00:30:23,904
from having a roommate who's familiar
with the system around here.

500
00:30:24,806 --> 00:30:26,156
<i> What a nightmare.</i>

501
00:30:26,683 --> 00:30:27,758
Fun.

502
00:30:29,311 --> 00:30:32,320
Uh, did you just come
from art class?

503
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:33,989
Oh, no.
That's my warrior board.

504
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:36,449
It's like a visual collection
of my destiny.

505
00:30:36,526 --> 00:30:38,159
It also helps me
manifest my goals.

506
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:40,212
<i> If I didn't already</i>
<i>have an escape plan,</i>

507
00:30:40,289 --> 00:30:42,381
<i>I'd really start
going crazy in here.</i>

508
00:30:42,457 --> 00:30:43,874
<i>As soon as I have what I need,</i>

509
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:45,950
<i>I'll find the door marked "X"</i>

510
00:30:46,028 --> 00:30:48,420
<i>in the basement that Veronica
used when they broke Cheryl out.</i>

511
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,055
Isn't the King marvelous?

512
00:30:50,132 --> 00:30:51,740
Ever since I came here,

513
00:30:51,742 --> 00:30:53,100
I've been having the most
wonderful conversations with him.

514
00:30:54,711 --> 00:30:56,377
Wait, what are you saying?

515
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:58,972
That you've actually been talking
to the Gargoyle King in person?

516
00:30:59,049 --> 00:31:01,141
Yes. We've become very close.

517
00:31:01,217 --> 00:31:02,484
Really?

518
00:31:05,639 --> 00:31:08,240
Do you think
you could introduce us?

519
00:31:08,317 --> 00:31:10,075
No. That's
Sister Woodhouse's job.

520
00:31:10,727 --> 00:31:12,578
What is?

521
00:31:12,654 --> 00:31:16,248
The sisters take patients into the Gargoyle
King's chamber when they misbehave.

522
00:31:16,325 --> 00:31:18,333
The other girls are
scared of him, but I'm not.

523
00:31:19,494 --> 00:31:21,912
Uh... Where's his chamber?

524
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:24,047
I can't tell you.
That's Sister Woodhouse's job.

525
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:29,344
Hmm. You'd tell Jughead.

526
00:31:32,582 --> 00:31:33,515
About Jughead.

527
00:31:35,377 --> 00:31:38,353
I wasn't going to mention this,
but, since you brought him up,

528
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,515
Betty,

529
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:44,943
I don't think Jughead's
into you anymore.

530
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:49,448
We connected when we played
the game together, and

531
00:31:49,524 --> 00:31:52,025
things got pretty hot
and heavy in the bunker.

532
00:31:52,102 --> 00:31:53,785
<i> This psycho bitch.</i>

533
00:31:53,862 --> 00:31:55,528
Oh, he definitely told me

534
00:31:55,605 --> 00:31:58,624
about how you blackmailed him
into kissing you.

535
00:32:02,463 --> 00:32:03,903
I knew you would do this.

536
00:32:03,905 --> 00:32:06,247
You have always acted
like you're better than me.

537
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:09,250
- You and all your shallow friends.
- What are you talking about?

538
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:11,169
This isn't Riverdale High.

539
00:32:11,246 --> 00:32:12,712
The rules are different here.

540
00:32:12,789 --> 00:32:15,423
I'm the queen bee.
Not you, Betty Cooper.

541
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,633
And if you wanna get better,

542
00:32:16,644 --> 00:32:18,051
you have to
change your attitude.

543
00:32:18,128 --> 00:32:20,095
And you have to be honest
with yourself,

544
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:22,022
and with others.
And you can start

545
00:32:23,192 --> 00:32:24,983
with what you threw
into the trash.

546
00:32:30,473 --> 00:32:33,692
Ethel, I'm sorry.

547
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:37,028
I want to be your friend,
if you'll have me.

548
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,156
Can you just not
tell anyone about the candy?

549
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:42,542
Could you just
keep it between us, please?

550
00:32:43,996 --> 00:32:44,962
Roomie?

551
00:32:47,916 --> 00:32:50,676
Okay, Betty. I'll keep
it our little secret.

552
00:32:50,752 --> 00:32:52,010
Thank you.

553
00:32:52,087 --> 00:32:53,595
But you really should
take the candy.

554
00:32:54,515 --> 00:32:55,997
It's super delicious.

555
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:00,310
<i> Be careful</i>
<i>of the thorns, girls.</i>

556
00:33:03,131 --> 00:33:04,231
Very good, my child.

557
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,752
<i> That's funny.</i>

558
00:33:08,754 --> 00:33:12,864
<i>The sisters don't serve
maple syrup in the cafeteria.</i>

559
00:33:12,941 --> 00:33:16,118
<i>And why would Claudius Blossom
be making the delivery?</i>

560
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,746
<i>Wait, what the hell?</i>

561
00:33:28,198 --> 00:33:31,958
<i>What kind of business does Hiram
Lodge have with Sister Woodhouse,</i>

562
00:33:32,035 --> 00:33:34,261
<i>and how are the Blossoms
connected to it?</i>

563
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:39,433
Hey. Do you know who that is?

564
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:42,969
They call him
the Man in Black.

565
00:33:43,046 --> 00:33:44,253
He's an angel donor.

566
00:33:44,331 --> 00:33:46,732
Helps the sisters
with anything they may need.

567
00:33:46,808 --> 00:33:47,774
Isn't that nice of him?

568
00:33:48,736 --> 00:33:50,143
Yeah. Amazing.

569
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,978
<i> Wait a minute.</i>
<i>According to my mom,</i>

570
00:33:52,055 --> 00:33:54,397
<i>Hiram was the one
who brought the Fizzle Rocks</i>

571
00:33:54,408 --> 00:33:56,408
<i>to Ascension Night
all those years ago.</i>

572
00:33:56,485 --> 00:33:58,952
Back to it, Betty. Idle hands
make the devil's work.

573
00:34:00,489 --> 00:34:01,621
<i> Bite me.</i>

574
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,417
<i>What did
Hiram give the sisters?</i>

575
00:34:05,494 --> 00:34:08,244
<i>And what did
Woodhouse give him?</i>

576
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:11,414
<i>Maybe there's a clue in those
files they're keeping.</i>

577
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:13,884
<i>If I can just find the right
office or records room.</i>

578
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:22,309
<i>Wait, this must be the Gargoyle King's
chamber Ethel was talking about.</i>

579
00:35:16,565 --> 00:35:17,531
What do you think
you're doing?

580
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:20,525
This area is off-limits.

581
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:22,819
Ethel, I...

582
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:25,038
Do you know where
the medical archives are?

583
00:35:25,115 --> 00:35:28,458
Sister Agnes sent me to fetch
some files. I got kinda lost.

584
00:35:29,086 --> 00:35:30,669
Silly Betty.

585
00:35:30,745 --> 00:35:32,587
Only the infirm are
allowed in the infirmary.

586
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:36,332
It's time to go back
to our room now.

587
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:37,843
While I'm watching.

588
00:35:37,919 --> 00:35:39,010
Okay.

589
00:35:46,928 --> 00:35:50,355
<i> Acting normal.</i>
<i>This is me, acting normal.</i>

590
00:35:50,432 --> 00:35:55,402
<i>All I need is a pen, a bobby pin
that hasn't been dulled down, or...</i>

591
00:35:56,605 --> 00:35:58,113
<i>A paper clip. Bingo.</i>

592
00:36:06,231 --> 00:36:08,081
Hey, Betty. Come play with us.

593
00:36:10,526 --> 00:36:12,160
Uh, no thanks, Ethel.

594
00:36:12,237 --> 00:36:13,461
Betty, you said
we were friends.

595
00:36:15,031 --> 00:36:17,040
And friends play together.

596
00:36:17,116 --> 00:36:20,335
<i> This isn't how I imagined
myself getting to those medical files.</i>

597
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:23,638
<i>But since only the infirm go
to the infirmary...</i>

598
00:36:26,134 --> 00:36:27,934
You wanna be
real friends, Ethel?

599
00:36:29,804 --> 00:36:35,358
Hmm. That's weird, because real friends
don't kiss each other's boyfriends.

600
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:39,979
That's because
the Gargoyle King wants

601
00:36:40,056 --> 00:36:41,940
- Jughead and me to be together.
- Oh, yeah?

602
00:36:42,016 --> 00:36:43,116
We're gonna be a ship.

603
00:36:43,851 --> 00:36:44,868
Oh.

604
00:36:45,654 --> 00:36:46,620
Ethelhead?

605
00:36:49,032 --> 00:36:50,749
In your dreams.

606
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:53,368
You're just jealous.

607
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:55,253
You're jealous that Jughead
and I are worthy,

608
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:57,664
and you're not,
but here's the thing, Betty.

609
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:59,749
Okay? You're never
going to be worthy.

610
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,418
And the Gargoyle King,
you're never gonna meet him.

611
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:03,637
<i> Here we go.</i>

612
00:37:07,801 --> 00:37:09,643
Sister Woodhouse, help!
She's having a seizure.

613
00:37:11,438 --> 00:37:13,054
Ethel, get the nurse.

614
00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:15,123
<i> Yes, Ethel,</i>
<i>get the nurse.</i>

615
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:18,059
<i>And God willing, she'll take
me exactly where I need to go.</i>

616
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:21,279
There, there, Elizabeth.
You're going to be all right.

617
00:37:21,356 --> 00:37:22,447
We'll get you
to the infirmary.

618
00:37:27,037 --> 00:37:28,569
<i> Well, they bought it.</i>

619
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:31,906
<i>They actually believe
I had a seizure.</i>

620
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:34,960
Let's re-evaluate her dosage
as soon as possible.

621
00:37:35,036 --> 00:37:36,294
Yes, Sister Woodhouse.

622
00:37:54,556 --> 00:37:56,147
<i> Jackpot!</i>
<i>There you are.</i>

623
00:38:09,738 --> 00:38:10,996
<i>"Elizabeth Cooper."</i>

624
00:38:15,836 --> 00:38:19,170
<i>"Two doses of Bullio Lapis,
mornings only.</i>

625
00:38:19,247 --> 00:38:20,821
<i>Sporadic seizures.</i>

626
00:38:20,899 --> 00:38:23,341
<i>Patient seems to be
responding well to testing.</i>

627
00:38:23,418 --> 00:38:26,553
<i>Per H.L., increase dosage
after first week."</i>

628
00:38:27,589 --> 00:38:28,680
<i>H.L.?</i>

629
00:38:31,092 --> 00:38:32,909
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

630
00:38:32,911 --> 00:38:35,520
<i>Is Hiram Lodge using patients
at the Sisters' as lab rats?</i>

631
00:38:35,597 --> 00:38:38,273
<i>And what is
Bullio Lapis? Unless...</i>

632
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,750
Fizzle Rocks.

633
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:42,935
<i> Oh, my God. Okay.</i>
<i>Now that I have my proof,</i>

634
00:38:43,012 --> 00:38:45,071
<i>it's officially time
to get the hell out of here.</i>

635
00:38:46,441 --> 00:38:48,575
<i>The door to escape is
in the basement.</i>

636
00:38:54,524 --> 00:38:56,916
<i>"X" marks the spot,
just like Veronica said.</i>

637
00:38:57,693 --> 00:38:58,918
<i>I'm so out of here.</i>

638
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:04,382
No.

639
00:39:08,371 --> 00:39:10,263
No. No!

640
00:39:13,968 --> 00:39:15,143
There she is.

641
00:39:17,255 --> 00:39:19,731
Ethel. Sister Woodhouse.

642
00:39:20,642 --> 00:39:22,308
I just... I got lost again.

643
00:39:22,385 --> 00:39:24,778
I told you she was up to
no good, Sister Woodhouse.

644
00:39:26,648 --> 00:39:27,614
Restrain her.

645
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:29,366
No.

646
00:39:30,819 --> 00:39:31,785
No!

647
00:39:35,824 --> 00:39:38,032
What are you doing,
Sister Woodhouse?

648
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:42,245
You've been
a very bad girl, Betty.

649
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:43,963
You haven't been
taking your candy.

650
00:39:46,668 --> 00:39:47,801
Ethel.

651
00:39:47,877 --> 00:39:49,969
- Steady her.
- No. No!

652
00:39:59,088 --> 00:40:01,773
My King. My savior.

653
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:03,608
Guide me through the night.

654
00:40:03,685 --> 00:40:06,352
Bless me with your darkness,
gift me with your flight.

655
00:40:06,429 --> 00:40:09,823
She needs a good, strong talking
to from the King, I think.

656
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,750
I was wrong.
You are gonna meet the King.

657
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:41,855
No.

658
00:40:53,476 --> 00:40:55,034
The King awaits you.

659
00:41:12,846 --> 00:41:14,846
Now, let's try this again,
shall we?

660
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,435
Tell me what you see, Betty.

661
00:41:22,463 --> 00:41:23,521
A dead body.

662
00:41:27,343 --> 00:41:28,726
What do you see now?

663
00:41:28,737 --> 00:41:29,736
The Black Hood.

664
00:41:35,184 --> 00:41:36,242
And now?

665
00:41:40,782 --> 00:41:42,698
The Gargoyle King.

666
00:41:43,818 --> 00:41:45,952
Wonderful, wonderful work.

667
00:41:46,028 --> 00:41:47,962
You've already made progress.

668
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:50,373
<i> My King, my savior.</i>

669
00:41:50,383 --> 00:41:52,050
<i>Guide me through the night.</i>

670
00:41:52,126 --> 00:41:55,261
<i>Bless me with your darkness,
gift me with your flight.</i>
