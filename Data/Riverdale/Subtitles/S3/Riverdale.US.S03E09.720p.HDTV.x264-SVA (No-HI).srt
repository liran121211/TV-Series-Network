1
00:00:00,014 --> 00:00:01,175
Previously on <i>Riverdale...</i>

2
00:00:01,195 --> 00:00:02,505
I'm Cassidy.

3
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:04,545
We're gonna take what we want
and then we're gonna go.

4
00:00:04,545 --> 00:00:06,485
<i>If you tell me
you're going to Shadow mines...</i>

5
00:00:06,565 --> 00:00:08,105
<i>I am.</i>

6
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:09,695
Those guys would still be alive
if I wasn't in the picture.

7
00:00:09,775 --> 00:00:11,605
Andrews, the warden wants to see you.

8
00:00:11,685 --> 00:00:14,245
Killing that boy at Shadow Lake. You
have no one to blame but yourself.

9
00:00:14,315 --> 00:00:16,535
<i>The warden from that
juvie killed himself last night.</i>

10
00:00:16,615 --> 00:00:18,245
<i>I saw you with Hiram Lodge.</i>

11
00:00:18,325 --> 00:00:21,375
You're testing his drugs out on patients.
Why?

12
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:24,205
I only answer to one authority, Betty.

13
00:00:24,215 --> 00:00:26,625
<i>Let's convince them to escape.</i>

14
00:00:26,695 --> 00:00:29,595
<i>Let's give them the opposite of the
Gargoyle King, which is the Gryphon Queen.</i>

15
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:32,465
The King is dead.

16
00:00:32,535 --> 00:00:34,045
<i>You're all free.</i>

17
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:36,175
Betty, what are we going to do
with all these kids?

18
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:37,875
They have nowhere to go.

19
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:40,425
The bounty on your pal Archie
is why you got to cut him loose.

20
00:00:40,505 --> 00:00:42,055
I'm not just gonna ditch Archie, Mom.

21
00:00:42,135 --> 00:00:43,745
Your mom's right, Jug.

22
00:00:43,745 --> 00:00:45,345
<i>Wherever I go next,
it's got to be alone.</i>

23
00:00:45,425 --> 00:00:46,815
<i>Arch, we'll get
you a ride to the border.</i>

24
00:00:46,815 --> 00:00:47,975
<i>I know a guy up there
who can help.</i>

25
00:00:48,055 --> 00:00:49,815
Town's under quarantine.
Governor's orders.

26
00:00:49,885 --> 00:00:51,025
No one in or out.

27
00:00:53,815 --> 00:00:57,205
<i>What hero's journey would be
complete without a self-imposed exile?</i>

28
00:00:58,935 --> 00:01:00,745
<i>Witness Archie Andrews.</i>

29
00:01:00,825 --> 00:01:03,875
<i>Just as Luke Skywalker
went to planet Dagobah,</i>

30
00:01:03,955 --> 00:01:08,375
<i>so, too, has Archie been
in the Canadian hinterlands,</i>

31
00:01:08,445 --> 00:01:10,915
<i>wondering what dark demons
he would have to conquer</i>

32
00:01:10,925 --> 00:01:15,045
<i>before being able, finally, to go home.</i>

33
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:16,375
<i>And speaking of home,</i>

34
00:01:16,455 --> 00:01:18,335
<i>since Riverdale's quarantine,</i>

35
00:01:18,415 --> 00:01:20,425
<i>the crime rate in town had risen.</i>

36
00:01:20,505 --> 00:01:23,975
<i>There had been, for instance,
a series of daring cat burglaries.</i>

37
00:01:34,525 --> 00:01:38,275
You make an extremely sexy
Robin Hood, T.T.

38
00:01:38,355 --> 00:01:42,155
Stealing from the rich
to give to, well, us.

39
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:43,335
You're so crazy.

40
00:01:49,785 --> 00:01:50,835
I love you.

41
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:55,175
I love you.

42
00:01:59,455 --> 00:02:01,215
<i>It's been five weeks since we
were cut off from the rest of the world.</i>

43
00:02:01,295 --> 00:02:02,965
<i>The quarantine's been lifted,</i>

44
00:02:02,975 --> 00:02:06,055
<i>but the town still hasn't
gotten its pep back.</i>

45
00:02:06,135 --> 00:02:08,475
Blossom, Topaz, break it up.

46
00:02:08,555 --> 00:02:09,785
Bite me, Moose.

47
00:02:09,855 --> 00:02:11,075
It's one of the new school rules, Cheryl,

48
00:02:11,155 --> 00:02:13,155
all physical contact
must be kept to a minimum.

49
00:02:13,235 --> 00:02:14,725
Well, that doesn't make any sense.

50
00:02:14,805 --> 00:02:16,145
There haven't been
any seizures for weeks,

51
00:02:16,155 --> 00:02:17,945
and everything tested
has come back negative.

52
00:02:18,015 --> 00:02:20,155
The RROTC doesn't make the rules, Toni.

53
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:23,875
No, you just enforce them like
the crypto-fascists you are.

54
00:02:25,405 --> 00:02:26,665
Come on, T.T.

55
00:02:30,245 --> 00:02:31,895
<i>And though above ground,</i>

56
00:02:31,895 --> 00:02:34,345
<i>Riverdale was a haunted shell
of its former self,</i>

57
00:02:34,415 --> 00:02:37,335
<i>underground,
at Veronica's La Bonne Nuit,</i>

58
00:02:37,345 --> 00:02:40,045
<i>life was beautiful.</i>

59
00:02:49,385 --> 00:02:52,475
Cheryl, Toni!
Welcome, ladies.

60
00:02:52,485 --> 00:02:54,605
I've got your usual table waiting for you.

61
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,855
<i>- Merci, madame.</i>
- Enjoy.

62
00:03:01,495 --> 00:03:03,375
What's the good word, Reginald?

63
00:03:03,445 --> 00:03:05,365
The kegs are tapped out.

64
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,945
We've got more empty bottles than full.

65
00:03:08,025 --> 00:03:10,915
Hell, even your mocktails
are selling out tonight.

66
00:03:10,985 --> 00:03:12,375
It's nuts.

67
00:03:29,635 --> 00:03:31,895
- What was that?
- No, not again.

68
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:34,445
Just go back to sleep, Jug.

69
00:03:36,645 --> 00:03:39,185
Pray that that didn't wake up my mom.

70
00:03:39,265 --> 00:03:41,855
He's coming.
The Gargoyle King, he's coming to kill me!

71
00:03:41,935 --> 00:03:43,245
Hannah, hey, hey.

72
00:03:44,655 --> 00:03:47,405
No, he's not, Hannah.

73
00:03:47,415 --> 00:03:49,075
It was just a bad dream, okay?

74
00:03:49,085 --> 00:03:50,955
That's all over, remember?

75
00:03:51,025 --> 00:03:52,665
The Gargoyle King is dead.

76
00:03:52,735 --> 00:03:55,085
The Gryphon Queen, she slayed him.

77
00:03:55,165 --> 00:03:56,135
She saved us.

78
00:03:57,335 --> 00:03:59,045
Exactly, Tyler.

79
00:03:59,115 --> 00:04:02,755
Okay, but since we're up, can we play?

80
00:04:02,835 --> 00:04:05,675
Please, Betty,
it really does make us feel better.

81
00:04:05,755 --> 00:04:08,385
- Please, Betty.
- Please.

82
00:04:08,465 --> 00:04:11,525
Okay, just one quick round
and then back to bed.

83
00:04:22,605 --> 00:04:23,535
What is this?

84
00:04:26,695 --> 00:04:28,695
Who does this belong to?

85
00:04:28,775 --> 00:04:30,295
- Huh?
- They're Tyler's.

86
00:04:30,365 --> 00:04:31,335
He's been taking them.

87
00:04:38,465 --> 00:04:39,595
Tyler...

88
00:04:42,045 --> 00:04:43,805
Where did you get
the Fizzle Rocks?

89
00:04:43,885 --> 00:04:45,805
<i>An unnamed Serpent
dealing Fizzle Rocks?</i>

90
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:47,515
Are you sure this kid wasn't lying?

91
00:04:47,595 --> 00:04:50,715
If it was a lie, Tyler came
up with it pretty quickly.

92
00:04:50,795 --> 00:04:54,595
A Serpent dealing Hiram Lodge's
drugs like we're one of his gangs.

93
00:04:54,675 --> 00:04:58,475
This is my fault.
I was gone for too long.

94
00:04:58,485 --> 00:05:01,355
I left the Serpents high and dry.
I left you high and dry.

95
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:03,275
No, you were protecting Archie.

96
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:06,155
Yeah, and while I was busy
protecting the Red Paladin,

97
00:05:06,235 --> 00:05:08,205
Hiram made a play for the
entire town and he got it.

98
00:05:09,485 --> 00:05:11,075
Fizzle Rocks are everywhere.

99
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:13,165
Weatherbee's running Riverdale
High like it's a police state.

100
00:05:13,245 --> 00:05:15,505
We don't even have
an elected sheriff yet.

101
00:05:17,745 --> 00:05:21,165
Quarantine. Why would he
want the town quarantined?

102
00:05:21,175 --> 00:05:24,175
It can't just be because he wants
to expand his candy business

103
00:05:24,255 --> 00:05:26,165
and make more money, can it?

104
00:05:26,235 --> 00:05:29,845
Hiram was paying the Sisters to test
out his drugs on the patients there.

105
00:05:29,925 --> 00:05:32,885
I don't see how he could
possibly get away with that.

106
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:34,635
Attorney McCoy and I are just trying to get

107
00:05:34,715 --> 00:05:36,935
Sister Woodhouse and the rest of her nuns

108
00:05:37,005 --> 00:05:39,765
to rat him out, and we're close, I think.

109
00:05:39,845 --> 00:05:41,725
Oh, God, could you imagine

110
00:05:41,805 --> 00:05:44,485
Hiram Lodge finally paying for his crimes,

111
00:05:44,555 --> 00:05:46,745
brought down by the testimony of nuns?

112
00:05:48,775 --> 00:05:52,665
Well, maybe that means
Archie could come back home.

113
00:05:53,785 --> 00:05:55,195
<i>Wherever he is.</i>

114
00:05:55,215 --> 00:05:57,755
This is KDK 12 calling KDK 1.
Over.

115
00:05:58,785 --> 00:06:00,525
<i>This is KDK 1.</i>

116
00:06:00,605 --> 00:06:02,665
<i>How are things looking in
your neck of the woods? Over.</i>

117
00:06:02,745 --> 00:06:06,965
Same as the last few weeks,
quiet and clear. Over.

118
00:06:07,035 --> 00:06:10,055
<i>Glad to hear it. Still thinking about
staying on for another rotation,</i>

119
00:06:10,135 --> 00:06:12,435
<i>or are you ready to leave
the wilderness behind? Over.</i>

120
00:06:21,975 --> 00:06:24,905
I might sleep on it.
I'm still figuring things out.

121
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:27,405
I'm not sure if I'm ready to go back yet.

122
00:06:27,485 --> 00:06:30,575
<i>Copy that. Oh, we've been
getting some bear sightings.</i>

123
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:33,695
<i>So stay vigilant while you're
clearing the trails. Over.</i>

124
00:06:33,775 --> 00:06:35,375
Will do, ma'am.
Over and out.

125
00:06:37,735 --> 00:06:38,665
Come on.

126
00:07:06,685 --> 00:07:07,655
Shoot.

127
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,415
What the hell, man?

128
00:07:13,415 --> 00:07:15,335
Veronica Lodge
hasn't paid what she owes.

129
00:07:16,955 --> 00:07:18,125
Let go of me!

130
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:22,125
I'm sorry that this happened, Reggie.

131
00:07:23,445 --> 00:07:26,135
With my father breathing down our necks,

132
00:07:26,205 --> 00:07:27,885
I suppose it was only a matter of time.

133
00:07:30,045 --> 00:07:31,675
Sorry.

134
00:07:35,505 --> 00:07:38,925
Every time I make a beer run across
the border, I've been changing it up.

135
00:07:39,005 --> 00:07:41,315
Never taking the same road twice.

136
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:42,435
He got lucky.

137
00:07:42,445 --> 00:07:44,485
Daddy made it very clear

138
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:48,725
that if La Bonne Nuit was to continue
operating in a post-quarantine Riverdale,

139
00:07:48,805 --> 00:07:51,985
I'd have to give him 10% of
my earnings for the privilege.

140
00:07:51,995 --> 00:07:54,825
If you start paying him for protection now,

141
00:07:54,905 --> 00:07:56,115
you'll never stop.

142
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:59,585
But there are ways to minimize that price.

143
00:08:05,325 --> 00:08:07,245
5% feels fair.

144
00:08:07,325 --> 00:08:10,215
And once Daddy reviews
these well-cooked books,

145
00:08:11,705 --> 00:08:12,725
he'll be none the wiser.

146
00:08:17,265 --> 00:08:20,015
Has anyone ever told you
you're a badass?

147
00:08:29,865 --> 00:08:31,945
Hey, hey, Vegas.

148
00:08:35,355 --> 00:08:37,075
It's okay. We'll go this way.
Come on.

149
00:08:37,735 --> 00:08:38,915
Come on, Vegas.

This is KDK 12 calling KDK 1.

KDK 12 to KDK 1.
Do you read me?

153
00:09:37,355 --> 00:09:39,895
<i>This is KDK 1.
We're receiving you. Over.</i>

154
00:09:41,005 --> 00:09:43,385
I need help.
I've been attacked.

155
00:09:43,395 --> 00:09:45,025
By a grizzly.
I'm in bad shape.

156
00:09:45,095 --> 00:09:47,025
<i>How severe are
your injuries? Over.</i>

157
00:09:49,725 --> 00:09:51,975
- It's bad.
<i>- Stay calm. Help is on the...</i>

158
00:09:52,055 --> 00:09:54,315
You're cutting out.

159
00:09:54,395 --> 00:09:56,355
<i>Apply pressure, and are you
able to dress your wound?</i>

160
00:09:56,365 --> 00:09:58,705
Hello? Hello?

161
00:10:03,205 --> 00:10:04,455
Damn it!

162
00:10:29,925 --> 00:10:31,025
It's okay, boy.

163
00:10:39,075 --> 00:10:41,865
It's okay, boy.
They said they're on their way.

164
00:10:41,935 --> 00:10:44,085
We just gotta stay calm.
Good boy.

165
00:10:50,085 --> 00:10:52,215
Good boy, Vegas.

166
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,935
<i>I am exhausted, Betty.</i>

167
00:11:05,015 --> 00:11:09,015
We don't have the resources
to shelter these children.

168
00:11:09,095 --> 00:11:10,275
But the farm does.

169
00:11:11,115 --> 00:11:13,065
Mom, no.

170
00:11:13,135 --> 00:11:14,605
Well, they can't stay here.

171
00:11:14,615 --> 00:11:17,655
Can this please just wait
until after the trial?

172
00:11:17,735 --> 00:11:21,615
The only reason they left the Sisters
is because I convinced them to trust me.

173
00:11:21,695 --> 00:11:23,785
They've imprinted on me.

174
00:11:23,865 --> 00:11:25,665
I'm their Gryphon Queen.

175
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,775
Fine.

176
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:33,835
But as their queen, they are
your responsibility, not mine.

177
00:11:38,045 --> 00:11:39,475
<i>So, let me get this straight.</i>

178
00:11:39,545 --> 00:11:43,135
Regardless of the fact that
the Sisters abused children

179
00:11:43,145 --> 00:11:45,645
and tested Hiram Lodge's drugs on them,

180
00:11:45,715 --> 00:11:48,145
which is why they're in jail,
awaiting trial,

181
00:11:48,225 --> 00:11:51,145
their lawyer doesn't
want us to harass them?

182
00:11:51,155 --> 00:11:52,765
It gets worse.

183
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:55,655
I told Sowerberry that we'd
give the Sisters immunity

184
00:11:55,725 --> 00:11:59,065
if they agreed to testify against Hiram.

185
00:11:59,075 --> 00:12:02,705
He informed me that the nuns
had taken a vow of silence.

186
00:12:04,645 --> 00:12:06,405
So what if I testify?

187
00:12:06,485 --> 00:12:09,075
You already admitted that you were
all on drugs while at the Sisters,

188
00:12:09,155 --> 00:12:11,165
drugs that caused hallucinations.

189
00:12:11,245 --> 00:12:12,285
I know what I saw.

190
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:14,205
I believe you, Betty.

191
00:12:14,285 --> 00:12:15,715
But a jury won't.

192
00:12:20,575 --> 00:12:22,625
I like to give people
the benefit of the doubt.

193
00:12:22,705 --> 00:12:24,675
I like to believe they can change.

194
00:12:24,685 --> 00:12:26,685
But you never do, Daddy.

195
00:12:26,765 --> 00:12:29,265
If this is about the attack
on your delivery truck,

196
00:12:29,335 --> 00:12:30,855
I only know what I've heard,

197
00:12:30,935 --> 00:12:35,765
that someone sent the Gargoyle
Gang to apply pressure to you.

198
00:12:35,845 --> 00:12:38,025
World's gotten scary
these last few weeks.

199
00:12:38,035 --> 00:12:40,405
Well, I'm ready to face reality.

200
00:12:41,275 --> 00:12:43,825
I need protection,

201
00:12:43,905 --> 00:12:45,915
and you're the only person
who's offering it.

202
00:12:47,355 --> 00:12:48,825
It's nothing to be ashamed of,<i> mija.</i>

203
00:12:48,895 --> 00:12:51,875
15%, drop in the bucket.

204
00:12:51,955 --> 00:12:54,255
And no gargoyles will mess
with your contraband again.

205
00:12:55,735 --> 00:12:58,385
Unfortunately, business has been slow.

206
00:12:58,455 --> 00:13:00,715
- Hmm.
- How does 5% sound?

207
00:13:00,795 --> 00:13:03,335
Really?
Because Leo and Nico tell me

208
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:05,765
that your parking lot's
been packed every night.

209
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:07,645
Right, guys?

210
00:13:09,605 --> 00:13:11,065
Well, well,

211
00:13:11,135 --> 00:13:14,895
new coat, new capos, you're
walking tall these days.

212
00:13:14,975 --> 00:13:17,055
Hope those nuns in jail
don't crack under pressure

213
00:13:17,065 --> 00:13:20,565
and start talking about how
you were their candy man.

214
00:13:20,575 --> 00:13:23,615
All right, I'll settle for 10%
but I need to see your books.

215
00:13:24,655 --> 00:13:25,855
Naturally.

216
00:13:37,925 --> 00:13:39,385
Josie's sounding incredible these days.

217
00:13:40,835 --> 00:13:42,875
Only the best at La Bonne Nuit.

218
00:13:51,345 --> 00:13:53,215
<i>All right, Serpents,</i>

219
00:13:53,285 --> 00:13:56,555
it's come to my attention that one
of us has been dealing Fizzle Rocks.

220
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:58,555
Slinging dope is not
what Serpents do.

221
00:13:58,635 --> 00:14:00,895
So from this moment on,
we're going clean.

222
00:14:00,975 --> 00:14:04,105
There'll be no selling or doing drugs.

223
00:14:04,115 --> 00:14:07,905
No crime of any kind will be tolerated.

224
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:10,785
Anyone that breaks the
Serpent code will be exiled.

225
00:14:12,365 --> 00:14:13,405
Permanently.

226
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:15,125
I think it's pretty ridic

227
00:14:15,205 --> 00:14:18,455
that you vanish for a month on
some vision quest with your bestie,

228
00:14:18,465 --> 00:14:22,545
only to return and lecture us
about responsibility.

229
00:14:22,615 --> 00:14:25,505
We got no money coming in, Jug.

230
00:14:25,515 --> 00:14:28,095
I mean, how are we
supposed to eat, survive?

231
00:14:31,295 --> 00:14:33,635
We'll figure it out and get
back to you, Fangs. All of you.

232
00:14:33,715 --> 00:14:38,485
In the meantime,
"In unity, there is strength."

233
00:14:38,555 --> 00:14:40,485
In unity, there is strength.

234
00:14:54,905 --> 00:14:56,365
Go away!

235
00:14:56,445 --> 00:14:59,705
I'm so, so sorry
this happened to you, Josie.

236
00:14:59,785 --> 00:15:01,665
I'm paying someone
a lot of money to make sure

237
00:15:01,745 --> 00:15:03,915
this exact sort of thing doesn't happen.

238
00:15:03,995 --> 00:15:06,215
They were from your
father's gang, weren't they?

239
00:15:09,425 --> 00:15:11,515
You know, whatever problems
you've got with him,

240
00:15:11,595 --> 00:15:14,215
I can't be dragged into them, Veronica.

241
00:15:14,295 --> 00:15:16,425
Either you get this mess
straightened out,

242
00:15:16,505 --> 00:15:19,275
or La Bonne Nuit finds itself
a new headliner.

243
00:15:20,675 --> 00:15:22,605
<i>They helped me.
Gave me freedom,</i>

244
00:15:22,675 --> 00:15:24,085
<i>gave me back my life.</i>

245
00:15:24,085 --> 00:15:26,685
At the farm, you won't be
the only ones doing chores.

246
00:15:26,695 --> 00:15:28,115
Everybody's equal.

247
00:15:29,985 --> 00:15:32,415
Um, Polly? Evelyn?

248
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:35,695
The hell's going on?

249
00:15:35,705 --> 00:15:38,455
Mom called. She said that
you had your hands full.

250
00:15:38,525 --> 00:15:40,375
Want a T-shirt?

251
00:15:40,455 --> 00:15:42,785
Um, no, and neither do they.

252
00:15:42,865 --> 00:15:45,795
Guys, don't take anything
from these two vampires, okay?

253
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,005
They're bribing you.

254
00:15:47,075 --> 00:15:48,965
Betty doesn't know
what she's saying.

255
00:15:49,035 --> 00:15:54,095
When I escaped the Sisters, the
farm became my salvation, my family.

256
00:15:54,105 --> 00:15:55,395
Okay, as your Gryphon Queen,

257
00:15:55,465 --> 00:15:58,725
I promise to protect you
and keep you safe.

258
00:15:58,735 --> 00:16:01,435
And trust me, the farm is not safe.

259
00:16:01,505 --> 00:16:04,355
Not safe? Did you tell them how
the Gargoyle King and his henchmen

260
00:16:04,425 --> 00:16:07,025
broke into this house
and terrorized you and Mom?

261
00:16:07,095 --> 00:16:10,985
What about these drugs we found here?

262
00:16:10,995 --> 00:16:13,365
How can you be protecting
them if you're allowing them

263
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,775
to put these dangerous
chemicals into their bodies?

264
00:16:15,855 --> 00:16:18,325
I didn't know. I don't know
how they're getting them.

265
00:16:18,405 --> 00:16:21,205
They're too scared to tell
you because you're a Serpent.

266
00:16:21,275 --> 00:16:22,365
But they told us.

267
00:16:22,445 --> 00:16:24,585
A Serpent dealer named Fangs Fogarty.

268
00:16:28,575 --> 00:16:30,335
<i>If you were hard
up, you could've talked to me.</i>

269
00:16:30,415 --> 00:16:33,215
The quarantine happened, I needed money.
You were gone.

270
00:16:33,295 --> 00:16:35,685
Well then, you could've talked to me.
And what do you need money for?

271
00:16:42,515 --> 00:16:44,595
My mom's sick.

272
00:16:44,615 --> 00:16:48,565
She's got treatments
that we can't pay for.

273
00:16:48,635 --> 00:16:51,065
You're like a brother to me, Fangs.
We could've helped you.

274
00:16:51,145 --> 00:16:52,275
I was ashamed.

275
00:16:52,285 --> 00:16:54,065
So you started dealing Fizzle Rocks?

276
00:16:54,145 --> 00:16:56,165
And where'd you get it, the Gargoyle Gang?

277
00:17:00,945 --> 00:17:02,455
I'm out now?

278
00:17:02,525 --> 00:17:04,165
The punishment for breaking
this code is immediate exile.

279
00:17:10,635 --> 00:17:12,795
However, you'd had
a rougher year than most.

280
00:17:15,295 --> 00:17:16,595
I'm willing to look
the other way just this once,

281
00:17:16,665 --> 00:17:19,135
but this has to stay between us, okay?

282
00:17:19,145 --> 00:17:21,015
- And if I catch you dealing drugs again...
- You won't.

283
00:17:23,145 --> 00:17:24,275
I'm done.

284
00:17:58,435 --> 00:18:00,845
Is that...

285
00:18:00,855 --> 00:18:04,425
A Glamourge egg, worth more than the
GNP of most developing countries.

286
00:18:04,505 --> 00:18:06,395
Why, yes, Kitty Cat, it is.

287
00:18:09,015 --> 00:18:10,525
Okay, let's go.

288
00:18:14,365 --> 00:18:15,905
Wait, T.T.

289
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,545
I'm feeling particularly brazen tonight.

290
00:18:44,475 --> 00:18:45,475
Cassidy.

291
00:18:49,055 --> 00:18:51,015
Good. You're awake.

292
00:18:51,095 --> 00:18:52,275
Time to play.

293
00:18:56,225 --> 00:18:58,245
This isn't real.
You guys are all dead.

294
00:18:58,325 --> 00:19:02,085
You keep saying that but then how
are we here, talking with you?

295
00:19:02,155 --> 00:19:03,915
I'm dreaming.

296
00:19:03,995 --> 00:19:07,205
I must be, or I'm hallucinating
from the loss of blood.

297
00:19:07,275 --> 00:19:10,255
Or we're here and this is real.

298
00:19:10,335 --> 00:19:13,755
No. I went to juvie

299
00:19:13,835 --> 00:19:16,425
after being framed for
your murder, Cassidy.

300
00:19:16,495 --> 00:19:20,045
I found you three in the mines after
Sheriff Minetta gunned you down.

301
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:23,635
If what you say is true,
then we are dead.

302
00:19:23,715 --> 00:19:25,725
And it sounds like
it's all your fault.

303
00:19:25,805 --> 00:19:27,725
If you ever want to return to Eldervair,

304
00:19:27,795 --> 00:19:30,315
you're gonna have to play and win.

305
00:19:32,945 --> 00:19:35,615
Come on.
One round at least.

306
00:19:43,365 --> 00:19:44,495
One round.

307
00:19:46,275 --> 00:19:48,795
Any luck, Ms. Weiss?

308
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,535
I'm on the phone with Child
Services nonstop, Betty.

309
00:19:51,615 --> 00:19:52,845
But...

310
00:19:54,965 --> 00:19:56,415
But it's gonna be hard

311
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:59,675
getting the kids you're
housing adopted or fostered.

312
00:19:59,745 --> 00:20:02,305
There's concern about the
emotional trauma they've suffered.

313
00:20:02,385 --> 00:20:06,805
Yeah, well, the Sisters
really did a number on them.

314
00:20:06,815 --> 00:20:09,565
Any luck getting the Sisters
to testify against Hiram Lodge?

315
00:20:11,345 --> 00:20:13,195
They've taken a vow of silence.

316
00:20:14,195 --> 00:20:16,445
It's part of their religion.

317
00:20:16,525 --> 00:20:18,075
- Religion?
- Mmm-hmm.

318
00:20:19,355 --> 00:20:22,275
Betty,

319
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:26,495
as a social worker, I've had dealings
with the Sisters over the years.

320
00:20:26,575 --> 00:20:29,545
And there's something you need to know
about their affiliation with the church.

321
00:20:31,175 --> 00:20:34,415
Josie was stalked, Daddy,
by those gargoyles of yours.

322
00:20:34,425 --> 00:20:37,675
So tell me, if I'm paying you
10% for protection

323
00:20:37,755 --> 00:20:39,415
why is my headliner getting harassed?

324
00:20:39,495 --> 00:20:42,675
Because you had the audacity
to try to deceive me.

325
00:20:42,685 --> 00:20:46,145
Cooking the books, that's
the move of a rank amateur.

326
00:20:46,225 --> 00:20:48,095
Now, I want the full amount
that's owed me.

327
00:20:48,175 --> 00:20:50,685
Oh, and your mother's
Glamourge egg that was stolen.

328
00:20:51,345 --> 00:20:52,875
Come again?

329
00:20:52,955 --> 00:20:54,975
One of your Serpent school
chums broke into our apartment

330
00:20:55,055 --> 00:20:56,815
and stole your mother's bauble.

331
00:20:56,885 --> 00:20:58,825
And based on
the calling card they left,

332
00:21:00,685 --> 00:21:03,155
I'm guessing
it's probably Cheryl Blossom.

333
00:21:03,225 --> 00:21:05,865
Anyway, get it back for me, won't you?

334
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,445
Why is this my responsibility?

335
00:21:07,525 --> 00:21:09,245
Because you have
more to lose than me.

336
00:21:11,285 --> 00:21:13,035
<i>You need to fix this, Jughead.</i>

337
00:21:13,045 --> 00:21:14,955
If Cheryl took the egg,
why did you come to me?

338
00:21:15,035 --> 00:21:16,425
Why didn't you just
go directly to her?

339
00:21:16,505 --> 00:21:18,665
She's dodging my phone calls.

340
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:21,055
Besides, aren't you her king?

341
00:21:21,135 --> 00:21:22,875
Since when are you
and your father aligned?

342
00:21:22,955 --> 00:21:26,715
We're not. He's squeezing me,
he's squeezing my business.

343
00:21:26,725 --> 00:21:30,475
Now, not only does he
have me paying him protection,

344
00:21:30,545 --> 00:21:33,895
he's got me on this wild-goose chase
to get my mom's stolen egg back.

345
00:21:33,975 --> 00:21:35,565
You're paying your father
protection money?

346
00:21:35,645 --> 00:21:37,655
Against his very own
Gargoyle Gang.

347
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:43,275
What if you were to pay less money
not to be in business with him?

348
00:21:43,355 --> 00:21:44,445
What are you suggesting?

349
00:21:44,515 --> 00:21:46,205
Let the Serpents come work for you.

350
00:21:46,285 --> 00:21:48,245
You get real protection
from your father's goons

351
00:21:48,325 --> 00:21:51,625
and the Serpents get jobs with a
steady income. This is a win-win.

352
00:21:53,405 --> 00:21:56,335
Get me that Glamourge egg back
and we have an accord.

353
00:22:00,495 --> 00:22:01,635
It's your turn, Red.

354
00:22:07,585 --> 00:22:09,855
"Defeat the Hooded Spectre of Death."

355
00:22:12,135 --> 00:22:13,165
Go on.

356
00:22:16,685 --> 00:22:19,065
The challenge reveals the weakness,

357
00:22:19,135 --> 00:22:21,155
the weakness is
what keeps you from winning.

358
00:22:36,535 --> 00:22:37,505
Give me your wallet!

359
00:22:59,725 --> 00:23:01,565
I did it.

360
00:23:01,635 --> 00:23:04,315
Now am I finished playing this game?

361
00:23:04,325 --> 00:23:06,705
The Red Paladin returns.

362
00:23:07,825 --> 00:23:09,065
Warden Norton?

363
00:23:09,145 --> 00:23:11,405
Take a load off, my boy.

364
00:23:11,485 --> 00:23:13,045
We're just getting started.

365
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,680
I'm not playing the game
with someone who died from it.

366
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,390
I didn't die.
I ascended to the Kingdom.

367
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,810
And what about Joaquin?
Did he ascend, too?

368
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:28,570
That was his reward
for stabbing me, wasn't it?

369
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:31,410
That was the card
Mr. DeSantos drew,

370
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,320
his do-or-die moment.

371
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:36,320
You know all about those,
don't you, Archie?

372
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,990
Did you have one yourself?

373
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:40,000
With the Black Hood?
Yes.

374
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,500
And I stopped him, but I'm
still trapped here in this hell.

375
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,760
Then that wasn't the moment,

376
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,140
the place and time
where it all went wrong.

377
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:53,340
Roll the dice

378
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:56,690
and you may find the path
that leads back to Eldervair.

379
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:02,390
We know your secret,
Sister Woodhouse.

380
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:06,230
The church disbanded the Sisters of
Quiet Mercy during the Vatican II

381
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:10,440
over allegations of cruel
and inhumane practices.

382
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:15,540
You and your sisters haven't
been nuns for more than 60 years.

383
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:19,370
Which means your vow of
silence won't hold up in court.

384
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,240
So here's a new deal.
Testify against Hiram Lodge

385
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,160
and I won't have you charged
with the following crimes,

386
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:29,130
child endangerment, illegal
drug testing, human trafficking.

387
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,890
Fine.

388
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,760
What do I need to do?

389
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,680
Swear in court that Hiram Lodge

390
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,770
gave you money and drugs
for illegal testing.

391
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,980
Then you'll have immunity.

392
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,700
Serpents, earlier today,

393
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,700
I brokered a deal.

394
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,400
I got us a paid gig.

395
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,670
From here on out, we'll be working
security detail for Veronica Lodge,

396
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,950
her speakeasy and her employees.

397
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,840
Long live the Serpents! Whoo!

398
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:08,410
Settle down.

399
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,430
I know it's good news for a change,

400
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,680
but I've also gathered us here
for less celebratory reasons.

401
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:17,850
Cheryl, Toni,

402
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,140
- come up here.
- Excuse me?

403
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:25,310
- What did we do?
- You broke into the Lodge apartment

404
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,820
and stole a Glamourge egg.

405
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:31,180
So what if we did?

406
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:34,200
Well, more than that,
you left your calling card,

407
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,780
attaching yourself,
and by extension,

408
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:38,610
all of the Serpents
to your crime.

409
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:41,200
I'm not afraid of Lodge.
What's he gonna do,

410
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,710
call the sheriff?

411
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,160
Oh, right, there is no sheriff.

412
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,540
Cheryl, that's not the point.
You broke the code.

413
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,710
Turn in your jackets and go.

414
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,040
Are you serious, Jones?

415
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,390
I'm a Serpent by blood.

416
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,050
You can't take that away from me.

417
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:56,840
You hypocrite.

418
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:59,260
You give your drug-dealing buddy
Fangs a pass but you crucify us?

419
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:00,970
And in case you were
wondering how we know,

420
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,600
- Fangs told Sweet Pea, who told me.
- Who told me.

421
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:08,360
If you're asking for our jackets,
shouldn't you be asking for his as well?

422
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,370
Jug.

423
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:19,870
You're right.

424
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:23,160
- Fangs, give me your jacket.
- Hey, what the hell, man?

425
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,630
It's okay, Sweet Pea.

426
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,310
Some leader you are.

427
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:47,940
Fangs.

428
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,820
Cheryl, Toni.

429
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,770
We'll go but we're
keeping our jackets.

430
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,990
Fine, but I need that egg back.

431
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:03,200
- Come again?
- You need to give me that damn egg

432
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,320
or Veronica won't give us
the protection contract.

433
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,070
Why the hell would I care?
I'm not a Serpent anymore.

434
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:09,710
Because I believe that you
still have honor, Cheryl.

435
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,300
And it's getting cold out.

436
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:14,720
And the rest of us don't get
to go back to Thistlehouse.

437
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,800
Well done, Torombolo.

438
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:22,630
Cost me a lot to get that ugly thing back.

439
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,180
So make sure you put it to good use.

440
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:26,390
Oh, don't you worry.
I shall.

441
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,690
And in the meantime, you and the
Serpents have your first assignment.

442
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,860
You ever hear of the Gargoyle Gang?

443
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,360
<i>Tyler, what the
hell happened to you?</i>

444
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,450
You lied to us.

445
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,660
What do you mean?
I would never.

446
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,120
You said he was dead,
but I saw him.

447
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:46,110
I saw the Gargoyle King.

448
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:48,210
Oh, my God.

449
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,170
What? Where?

450
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:52,560
Fox Forest.

451
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,920
He was there with other
gargoyles, his gang.

452
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,290
They beat me up.

453
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:58,830
The Gryphon Queen is a liar.

454
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,050
And if she lied about the
Gargoyle King being dead,

455
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,510
maybe she lied when
she says we're safe here.

456
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,850
No, I'm not.
You have to believe me.

457
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:08,470
The Sisters are going to
testify against the Man in Black

458
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:10,100
and then you will all be safe.

459
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:11,510
Where, Betty?

460
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:12,900
Where will we be safe?

461
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:23,410
It's your turn, Red Paladin.

462
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:25,450
Go on.

463
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,870
Pick your Quest Card.

464
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:38,380
What does it say?

465
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,040
"Kill the Gargoyle King."

466
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,260
Are you sure?

467
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,270
Read it again.

468
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:50,900
"Kill the Man in Black."

469
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,480
You have your marching orders.

470
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,400
Slay the dragon.

471
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:01,950
Good luck.

472
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:39,070
The Gargoyle King.

473
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,740
The Man in Black.

474
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,660
How many names do you have, Hiram?

475
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,120
I know why you've come.

476
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:55,200
Do you genuinely think killing
me will solve all your problems?

477
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,040
It's what I should have done that night.

478
00:29:57,050 --> 00:30:00,960
In here. My do-or-die moment
before you had me arrested.

479
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:04,140
Yeah, it was awfully stupid
of you to come in here,

480
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:07,510
threaten me, tell me all your plans.

481
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,470
I mean, what was I supposed to do,

482
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,850
not have you arrested?

483
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,520
Put that down, Archie.

484
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,100
You're not gonna...

485
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,820
I don't understand.
What are you guys doing here?

486
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:37,120
I thought...
I thought it was over.

487
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,340
You're almost done.

488
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:40,880
Just one last round to play.

489
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,340
Have you been working
on any new songs, Arch?

490
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,130
I'd love to hear some of them.

491
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:52,130
Betty, I haven't played guitar in forever.

492
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:53,690
I'm not the same person anymore.

493
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,530
I don't wanna do this.

494
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:02,690
I don't wanna play with you guys.

495
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,740
You have to.

496
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:06,190
It's the only way back.

497
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,320
Back to what?

498
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,410
Eldervair.

499
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,750
Riverdale.

500
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:13,250
Innocence.

501
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,800
Come on, Arch.

502
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:26,300
Time to play.

503
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:58,750
<i>Thanks for meeting
me at such short notice.</i>

504
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:01,920
A lot of the freed patients
from the Sisters of Quiet Mercy

505
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,760
have been orphaned or disowned.

506
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,890
My mom and I have been housing
them but that is becoming

507
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:11,710
untenable.

508
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:15,800
So if any of you are willing
or able to take a few in,

509
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:19,430
just until the Sisters have testified
against Hiram and he's behind bars...

510
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,640
I could take, you know,
some of the boys in.

511
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,940
And with Archie gone, I have the room.

512
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:31,400
I've saved many children from that
particular circle of hell before

513
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,290
and I'm happy to do it again.

514
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:37,960
Nana and I will board some
of the girls at Thistlehouse.

515
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:41,170
And we have a pullout here.
I'll house a couple.

516
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,300
Thank you.

517
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:46,080
<i>What about this deal with the Lodges?</i>

518
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,470
It's with Veronica,
it's not with the Lodges.

519
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,550
She's still a Lodge, boy,
don't you ever forget it.

520
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:54,800
You know, as I recall, you
worked for the Lodges once.

521
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:57,050
Does trashing that drive-in
ring any bells?

522
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:59,220
I want you to be
a better king than me.

523
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,310
Make us players instead of pawns.

524
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:03,640
That's what I'm trying to do, Dad.

525
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,770
Put me in.

526
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,400
I'm tired of sitting on the sidelines.
I'm not made for it.

527
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:31,840
We gotta stop meeting like this.

528
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,930
Shut your mouth.

529
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,970
Trash the cargo, all of it.

530
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:45,020
I... I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

531
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,780
- Let's go! Come on.
- It's an ambush!

532
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,570
Get 'em!

533
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,230
I tried to tell you.

534
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,240
Pick him up.

535
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:02,700
I want you to go back to your Gargoyle King

536
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:05,200
or your Man in Black or Hiram Lodge,

537
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,130
and I want you to tell him
that Veronica Lodge is now

538
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:10,000
under the protection of the Serpents

539
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,760
and that Riverdale has not fallen.

540
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:15,760
Go.

541
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,110
Mom?

542
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:39,120
Where are they?
Where are the kids?

543
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,990
After that one was attacked,

544
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:45,750
I called Edgar and asked him for advice.

545
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,800
And he came and took them to the farm.

546
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,480
Edgar did?

547
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,260
You only missed him by like five minutes.

548
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:00,220
It's your turn, Archie.
You have to pick a Quest Card.

549
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,150
Is this the last level?

550
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,700
Sure feels like it, doesn't it?

551
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,220
You don't have to do this, son.

552
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,520
He's the one who got me into this trouble.

553
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,810
Not the Black Hood,

554
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,150
not the Gargoyle King, not Hiram Lodge.

555
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:37,490
Him. It's the only way.

556
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:39,530
You could forgive him.

557
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,090
It's too late.

558
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:47,460
You are not the villain you think you are.

559
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:51,540
I've hurt everyone.

560
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,500
There's always another path home, son.

561
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:58,050
Not for me.

562
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,890
If I ever want to go
back to Riverdale again,

563
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:06,720
I have to destroy that part of me.

564
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:09,730
It's weak, it's bad, it's stupid.

565
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,230
Just come home, Archie.

566
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,780
I can't, Dad.

567
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,910
I have to do this one thing first.

568
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,910
I'm sorry, Dad.

569
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:32,740
I'm sorry for letting you down.

570
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,750
Archie, wait.

571
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,530
Fangs, my dad and I were talking.

572
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:28,200
We wanna give you
another shot at redemption.

573
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,360
- What are you thinking?
- We want you to go undercover.

574
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:32,020
Join the Gargoyle Gang.

575
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,490
We need a man on the inside of
Hiram Lodge's drug operation

576
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:36,630
so that we can take him down.
Are you in?

577
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,090
It'd be an honor.

578
00:39:56,590 --> 00:40:00,020
Attorney McCoy, I was just reviewing
our questions for the Sisters.

579
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:02,640
Don't bother, Betty.
The Sisters are gone.

580
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,900
<i>Gone? How?</i>

581
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,490
An anonymous donor
posted their bail.

582
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:10,640
Hiram Lodge.

583
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,530
<i>And they took off
who knows where.</i>

584
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,620
But not before leaving a message.

585
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:17,250
We go to join thee.

586
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:18,670
<i>Does that mean anything to you?</i>

587
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,960
Oh, my God.
I think I know where they went.

588
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:16,180
Come on, kid.
Come on, wake up.

589
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,730
Wake up, kid!

590
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:32,930
