1
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,330
- [narrator] Previously on Riverdale:
- Ben and I thought it was a game.

2
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,040
But it's not. It's so much more.

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,120
- He's real. The Gargoyle King.
- Dilton?

4
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,090
Ben. Hey.

5
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,090
Framing Archie for murder,
conspiring to keep him locked away?

6
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,220
You don't have a daughter anymore.

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,970
We start a version of the Farm.

8
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,560
You're actually buying this Farm crap

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,310
that a huckster named
Edgar Evernever is selling you.

10
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:33,850
[Alice] Oh, my God.

11
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,440
- Betty.
- I didn't kill anyone.

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,940
But I could've.
I have to take responsibility.

13
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,150
I can't put everyone through this again.

14
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,360
I'll take the deal.
Your Honor, I'm guilty.

15
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,530
[school bell ringing]

16
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,660
[Jughead] We've all felt it.

17
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,490
The first day of a new school year.

18
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,700
Butterflies in the stomach.

19
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,540
We've all looked around, and wondered,

20
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:56,580
where will I fit in here?

21
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,880
Who will I sit with at lunch?

22
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,300
Will I even make it till lunch?

23
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,520
Multiply that by a thousand,
and that's how Archie Andrews felt

24
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,930
as he was being processed

25
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,440
at the Leopold &amp; Loeb
Juvenile Detention Center.

26
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,820
Andrews. Warden wants to see you.
Let's go.

27
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,250
It's Shakespeare. Know what it means?

28
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:37,790
No, sir.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,840
Means you're alone
and have no one to blame but yourself.

30
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:42,500
I read your file.

31
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:46,010
Besides killing that
boy at Shadow Lake...

32
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,340
I'm told you have an affinity for music.

33
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,140
We have a music room.

34
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,180
No one uses it, but it's there.

35
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,560
I keep an orderly house, Mr. Andrews.

36
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,730
Respect that, and we'll
get on just fine.

37
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,820
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.

38
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,150
I just got off the phone with the warden
at juvenile hall.

39
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,030
He says Archie's been processed.

40
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,240
- He's okay.
- Oh, thank God.

41
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,215
Yeah.

42
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:16,700
They got a line on those three thugs
that gave false testimony against him.

43
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:19,080
I'm friends with the sheriff
at Shadow County.

44
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,250
He found a campfire in the deep woods.

45
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,590
Archie's in jail,
and these cretins are basically camping.

46
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,670
Not for long. We'll make sure of that.

47
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,760
Meanwhile I'll keep the home
fires burning at Riverdale High

48
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,930
so everyone knows my Archiekins
will be back in time for Homecoming.

49
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,680
And everything will be
just as he left it.

50
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,440
Dr. Patel kept Betty overnight
for observation,

51
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,270
but it was just a precaution.

52
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,360
Did he say what caused the seizure?

53
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,650
They ran tests, but he suspects
it's just good old-fashioned stress.

54
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,950
Oh, Betty.
I was up all night with the twins.

55
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,950
- We were so worried about you.
- You were worried about me?

56
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,830
And Juniper and Dagwood?
Are they all right?

57
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,370
Okay, here we go again.

58
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,330
Juniper and Dagwood are napping.
They're fine.

59
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,460
Why wouldn't they be?

60
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:10,930
Um, because I saw you and Mom throw the
twins into a giant bonfire last night.

61
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,090
Right, that's enough.

62
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,680
The only thing burning last night
was the hibachi in the backyard.

63
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,100
- We made skewers with friends.
- From the Farm?

64
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,480
Yeah, as a matter of fact.

65
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,600
You must've had a hallucination
while you had the seizure.

66
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,150
It was so real.

67
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,660
Sweetheart.

68
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,530
[cell phone buzzing]

69
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:39,450
[Betty] My God.

70
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,040
- Dilton is dead?
- Yeah.

71
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,540
And Ben from the drive-in?
He's barely hanging on.

72
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,380
Doctors don't know when,
or if, he's even gonna wake up.

73
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,920
Sheriff Minetta asked me
to keep it hush-hush for the families,

74
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,680
but, Betty, what I saw was...

75
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,800
- What, Jug?
- It was like a ritual site.

76
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,805
Their lips were blue.

77
00:03:57,856 --> 00:04:01,060
There were chalices, that were
filled with poison or something.

78
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,560
Animal bones were in a circle.
The tree had markings on it.

79
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,270
There was a winged totem,
with a skull and branches.

80
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,570
Was it a murder
or a suicide pact gone wrong?

81
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,240
I have no idea. I saw Ben and Dilton.

82
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,950
Playing a weird game at Pop's.

83
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,870
Dilton was raving
about someone called the Gargoyle King.

84
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,500
I was also thinking that maybe you and
I could investigate this together.

85
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,460
For old times' sake. Or at least until
we catch a new lead with Archie's case.

86
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:30,590
I like that idea.

87
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:36,840
I'll try to see if Dr. Curdle can get us
into the coroner's office.

88
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,430
Have more romantic words
ever been spoken?

89
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,430
No.

90
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,600
[man] You bunk with Mad Dog.

91
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,600
[inmates shouting]

92
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,780
[jazz music playing on speakers]

93
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,070
Hey.

94
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,700
I'm Archie. You're Mad Dog, right?

95
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,990
[exhaling sharply]

96
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,340
How long you been in?

97
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,060
[music stops]

98
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,200
- Listen, since we're cellmates...
- Nice shoes.

99
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,240
I'd keep them tied real tight.

100
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:52,840
Mr. Weatherbee? As Archie's girlfriend,
and former running mate,

101
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,670
I wanted to let you know I'm stepping in
as interim student body president.

102
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,640
Sorry, someone else already petitioned
to be president.

103
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,350
- Just this morning.
- What? Who did?

104
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:08,310
Cheryl, what do you think you're doing,
trying to steal Archie's presidency?

105
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,980
Who would you have lead us
through these dark times?

106
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,150
Ethel Muggs? I saw the
poor girl earlier.

107
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,280
She was fuguing about a winged creature

108
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,030
- that was after her.
- Actually...

109
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,360
I thought I'd keep Archie's seat warm.

110
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,410
Why? When JFK was shot,
Jackie O. didn't become president.

111
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:25,620
Lyndon B. Johnson did.

112
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,910
And then he lead us into Vietnam.

113
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm just saying.

114
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,920
Her man's in the big house, Cheryl.
Give her a break.

115
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,920
I get it. And I sympathize,
up to a point.

116
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,590
But let's be reals, Veronica.

117
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,010
I need this presidency
for college applications

118
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,350
a lot more than Archie.

119
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,830
You mind if I sit?

120
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,170
I'm Slash.

121
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,880
Who gave you that ink?

122
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,800
- Looks fresh.
- FP Jones did.

123
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:27,390
His son, Jughead, made me a Serpent.
Said I could hang out with you guys.

124
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,890
[Joaquin] You're no Serpent, Archie.

125
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:34,730
Joaquin.
What the hell are you doing in juvie?

126
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,940
Didn't you hear?
I came to town to help Fangs escape,

127
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:39,530
stuck around.

128
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,200
Got hauled in during Riot Night.

129
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,410
I know this guy, Slash.
He's Mr. Clean-Cut, All-American.

130
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,370
You're Jughead's pal, not a Serpent.

131
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,670
You have to earn our trust and
protection, with a test of loyalty.

132
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,920
See that Ghoulie?

133
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,340
I want you to go up to him...

134
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,800
and shiv him.

135
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,990
Don't worry about the guards.
We pay them to turn a blind eye.

136
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,850
Do that,
and then we'll have your back, huh?

137
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:13,980
You're kidding, right?

138
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:22,610
Not gonna happen, bro.

139
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,490
I don't need your protection that bad.

140
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,620
[inmate] Nice shoes.

141
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,290
[inmates whistling]

142
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,380
Dr. Curdle?

143
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,840
- Oh. You're not...
- I'm his son.

144
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:45,800
We spoke over the phone earlier.
I took over after my father passed away.

145
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,430
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Do you have the money?

146
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,440
The toxicology report revealed

147
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,150
lethal levels of cyanide
in Mr. Doiley's blood.

148
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,490
I surmise the surviving boy
didn't drink enough to finish the job.

149
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:07,240
Dr. Curdle, if you had to guess,
murder or suicide?

150
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,620
Well, the body did show signs of stress.

151
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:15,160
Three symbols carved out on his back.
Runic, I'd say.

152
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,460
Mind if I get a shot of this?

153
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,010
What caused, uh... the blue lips?

154
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:26,170
The cyanide was mixed
into a sugary drink called Fresh-Aid.

155
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,880
Blueberry-flavored.

156
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,600
There's something dimly familiar
about this.

157
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:35,680
But you asked me before
if I thought this was murder,

158
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,060
or suicide.

159
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,690
I'm not sure what it is,
but whatever it is,

160
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:43,610
it's darker
than what happened to Jason Blossom,

161
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,570
or what the Black Hood did.

162
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:48,320
No, what we're looking
at here, I believe,

163
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,990
is the true face of evil.

164
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,450
[playing blues tune]

165
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,670
- What's up, guys?
- You don't remember us?

166
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,210
Should I? Have we met before?

167
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:49,510
We were at the drag race
the day you called the cops on us.

168
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,800
We're in because of you.

169
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,640
Ghoulies.

170
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:53,800
Crap.

171
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,060
Look, I don't want any trouble.
I'm sorry.

172
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,140
Neither do we. We just want your shoes.

173
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,480
What?

174
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,940
Don't touch his face.

175
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,030
Why are you sitting that way?

176
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,990
I'm just a little sore, Ronnie.

177
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:14,370
Sore from what?

178
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,160
Working out. There's an amazing gym.

179
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,160
Uh-huh.

180
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,080
And where are your shoes?

181
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,540
The warden took them when I got here,
with my other clothes.

182
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,210
- That makes no sense.
- Ronnie.

183
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,090
Talk to me about school.

184
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,130
What am I missing?
How's the speakeasy coming?

185
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:33,890
It's coming.

186
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:36,140
What's it like,
being president in my place?

187
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,520
Hi, I'm checking in on the status
of a friend of mine, Ben Button.

188
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,320
Oh. Wait, he's out of the ICU?

189
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,940
That's great.

190
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:51,280
Uh, what time are your visiting hours?

191
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,030
Uh, thank you.

192
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,160
[Betty sighs]

193
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,620
Hi.

194
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,080
I'm Evelyn. And you're Betty Cooper?

195
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,870
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

196
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:06,130
Not exactly. We almost met,
through your mom and sister.

197
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,420
- They're studying with my dad.
- Edgar Evernever.

198
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,670
Yeah. That's right.

199
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,340
Anyway, I go to school here now.
I wanted to say hi,

200
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:17,970
let you know I won't tell anyone
about what happened the other night.

201
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,060
- What are you talking about?
- Your seizure, of course.

202
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,900
Wait, sorry, you...? You were there?

203
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:28,650
Your mom invited us over for a cookout,
and to burn a few of her things.

204
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,530
How are you feeling?

205
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,530
Uh... [chuckles]

206
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,200
Um...

207
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:39,280
Uh, you know what, Evelyn? I have to go.

208
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:42,410
I have to visit a
friend in the hospital.

209
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,330
So...

210
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,500
Yeah, no worries. I totally understand.

211
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:54,840
- Dude, what are you doing?
- What we've done all summer.

212
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:57,140
I thought we'd sneak off
to the boiler room...

213
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,640
My dad is right over there.

214
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,520
Why?

215
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,350
He's the new RROTC instructor.

216
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,810
He's making me sign up.

217
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:10,110
If he's around school,
we have to take it easy.

218
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,730
Hey, Cadet Mason.

219
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,320
On time is late. Let's go. Room 302.

220
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,160
Talk to you later.

221
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,250
[school bell ringing]

222
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:26,960
[pop music playing on speakers]

223
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,260
Veronica.

224
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,970
That's right, you work here now.

225
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,060
Cherry phosphate and curly fries. Girls?

226
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,390
I don't work at Pop's, Cheryl. I own it.

227
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,900
And as of this moment,
you're no longer welcome.

228
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:53,480
You can't discriminate against someone
'cause they're better-looking.

229
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:56,900
Cheryl, you're acting like trash,
and I don't wanna get a citation.

230
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:58,360
[sighs]

231
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,240
Vixens, leave us be.

232
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,330
Now, then.

233
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,120
What are you mad about?

234
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:12,040
It can't be that I'm making a play
for student body president.

235
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,210
Actually, that's exactly why I'm mad.

236
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,590
I promised Archie that when he gets out,

237
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,680
I'll have everything in place, waiting.

238
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,800
That includes this stupid presidency.

239
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:23,180
Just a suggestion,
but maybe channel that rage

240
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,810
into something more productive,
like getting your boyfriend sprung.

241
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,270
There's an organization
called the Innocence Project.

242
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:34,070
Looked into it when I was accused
of Jay-Jay's murder.

243
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:35,650
Maybe check it out.

244
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,070
A little food for thought.

245
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,070
Speaking of food, cancel my order.

246
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,160
I'm going to TGI Thursdays.

247
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,340
[woman on PA] Dr. Matthews
to Pediatrics.

248
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:02,970
[EKG beeping]

249
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,770
Hi, Mrs. Button.

250
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:11,560
- We wanted to see how Ben was doing.
- How do you know my Ben?

251
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:15,320
Uh... From school. And he and I worked
at the Twilight Drive-In.

252
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,320
Oh.

253
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:19,490
How he's doing?

254
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:21,990
He's stabilized,
but he hasn't woken up yet.

255
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,950
Do you know what happened
in the woods, Mrs. Button?

256
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:30,160
No. Ben's always been a bit
of an odd duck, you could say.

257
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,710
Kept to himself. Especially after
his piano teacher was murdered.

258
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,920
But this summer, he
became friends with...

259
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Dilton Doiley.

260
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:41,340
That's right.
It's like he became a different person.

261
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,600
Secretive, sneaking out at all hours.

262
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,180
Having these horrible nightmares.

263
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:49,810
Mrs. Button.

264
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,440
Know what this is, or how it got here?

265
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,440
Maybe that nice girl left it.

266
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,610
Someone else came to visit Ben?

267
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,150
Another friend from school.

268
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:03,320
I don't remember her name.
She wore a bow in her hair.

269
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,830
Jughead, Betty.

270
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:11,370
I don't care how Keller ran things
when he was sheriff.

271
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:15,250
I won't let a couple teenagers compromise
an active murder investigation.

272
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,540
If it's an active murder investigation,

273
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,590
start by letting
the rest of the town know.

274
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,510
Sheriff Minetta?

275
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:24,680
- What, Henderson?
- An Adventure Scout's parents called.

276
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,720
- Haven't seen him in two days.
- What?

277
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,100
We've got a missing kid. And he was
part of Dilton Doiley's troop.

278
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,820
- [Veronica] Madam Mayor.
- Wait, why are you not in school?

279
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,820
I'm on my way, but this couldn't wait.

280
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:49,120
I'm starting a chapter of the
Innocence Project here in Riverdale

281
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,450
and with a letter of support
from Town Hall,

282
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,790
I can cut through all
that silly red tape.

283
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:56,540
I can't get in this war
between you and your father.

284
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:59,540
But I'm not here as your daughter.
I'm here as a citizen.

285
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,550
One of your constituents
sits in juvenile detention,

286
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:07,300
wrongfully convicted,
and I intend to get him acquitted.

287
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:08,890
[Veronica sighs]

288
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:12,100
Your endorsement could help sway
a lot of dubious minds.

289
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:13,770
Please, Mom.

290
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,060
Fine.

291
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:20,820
- I'll have Gloria draft a letter.
- Wonderful.

292
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,070
Oh, and I'm also accepting donations.

293
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,700
[Jughead] Hi, Ethel.

294
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,870
- Does this look familiar to you?
- Where'd you get it?

295
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,080
Ben's hospital room.

296
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:37,830
- Why were you there?
- I don't have to tell you anything.

297
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,540
- You're not police.
- Ethel, wait.

298
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:43,460
We're trying to find out what happened
to Ben, Dilton, and the missing Scout.

299
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,540
- Is it the Gargoyle King?
- How do you know?

300
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,930
Dilton started to tell me,
but only got so far.

301
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,640
So, is it?

302
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:51,970
No. No.

303
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:52,970
It's the opposite.

304
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:56,520
I made that talisman
to... To protect Ben.

305
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,690
- How do you even know Ben?
- He's my boyfriend.

306
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:03,980
- I've never seen you two together.
- We started dating this summer.

307
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,360
- We spent all our time in the bunker.
- Bunker?

308
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,160
Never mind.

309
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,070
Ethel, just...

310
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,200
What bunker?

311
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,210
Dilton's.

312
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:18,120
In the woods.

313
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,170
Dilton Doiley has a secret bunker
in the woods?

314
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,750
It was our secret spot.

315
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,010
- And Dilton's, too.
- Can you at least tell us where it is?

316
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,890
I mean, I can't.

317
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:32,300
It's too hard to describe.

318
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,430
Then can you show us where it is?

319
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:38,520
Ethel, it's either us
or Sheriff Minetta.

320
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,560
Okay, fine.
But you have to keep it a secret.

321
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:42,690
- Sure.
- Of course.

322
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:44,900
And go at night, so nobody can see us.

323
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,570
Know where Fox Footbridge is?

324
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,870
I tried to warn you.

325
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:57,330
Yeah.

326
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,830
Apparently,
the Ghoulies really like sneakers.

327
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:04,290
You're a Serpent.

328
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,880
- Why didn't they look out for you?
- I wouldn't shiv a Ghoulie.

329
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,010
How come?

330
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,350
Because that's not who I am.

331
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:18,980
Maybe not yet.

332
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,480
But you will be soon.

333
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,190
When you got here, you
lost your humanity.

334
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:26,110
You're an animal in a cage now.

335
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:28,440
An animal does whatever he has to do
to live.

336
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,400
- To survive.
- What do you do, Mad Dog?

337
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:34,030
You're not a Ghoulie.
You're not a Serpent.

338
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:36,530
I doubt anyone in here messes with you.

339
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,660
You have stuff no other prisoner does.
Why?

340
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,500
You don't wanna know.

341
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,000
And trust me, you don't
wanna get tapped.

342
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,840
But take my advice this time.

343
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,300

You were there.

00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,740
Yeah, Gryphons &amp; Gargoyles.

517
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,120
Looks like Ben and Dilton
were in pretty deep.

518
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,250
I wonder if Ethel was playing with them.

519
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,920
Jug.

520
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:15,300
Is it the thing
that came at us last night?

521
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,970
Yeah, the Gargoyle King?

522
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,640
He's also featured on this copper coin.

523
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,560
Betty.

524
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,520
Oh, God.

525
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:31,440
"Drink from the correct cup."

526
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,980
Blue lips, cyanide.

527
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,070
It was a challenge.

528
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:37,240
Part of that stupid
game they're playing.

529
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:41,410
Pick the chalice that's not poisoned,
and...

530
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,870
win, I guess?

531
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,950
So, it was suicide?

532
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,410
Maybe.

533
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:50,540
Or something even more insidious.

534
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:04,310
[screaming]

535
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:09,270
- Know how worried your folks are?
- Doesn't matter.

536
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:12,020
I'm supposed to hide,
until Master Doiley comes back.

537
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,190
Jeez.

538
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:19,360
Kid, haven't you heard?
Dilton's not coming back.

539
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:22,240
- That's a lie.
- [Betty] No. It's not.

540
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,910
Dilton is...

541
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,910
dead.

542
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,540
I'm sorry.

543
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,880
You played Gryphons &amp; Gargoyles
with Dilton?

544
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,670
I was his apprentice. He was teaching me
so I could join the game.

545
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,670
With Ben Button,
and Ben's girlfriend Ethel Muggs?

546
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,590
Yes, but Princess Etheline isn't dating
Ben in real life, only in the game.

547
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:46,810
She warned me two enemies
might invade the bunker.

548
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:48,310
Okay, well, game's over.

549
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:50,310
All right?
I'm gonna get you back to your folks.

550
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:53,150
Then we need to pay another visit
to Princess Etheline.

551
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:56,230

556
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,710
- Not so fun without the pads, huh?
- No, this is great.

557
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:21,760
Holy hell.
It's about to get a whole lot better.

558

[chuckles]

559
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,860

560
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,270
That's my girl.

Why are you here?

587

Warden Norton is a friend,
and a business associate.

588
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:12,620
He told me about this little game,
and invited me to come see it.

589
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:16,120
- And you had nothing better to do.
- As disrespectful as you're being,

590
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:19,670
I won't let you flush your life
down the drain for a boy, a criminal.

591
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:23,670
And I think you'll find that after today,
you won't be allowed to visit Archie.

592
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:24,590
I get it.

593
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,630
Warden Norton is in your pocket.

594
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,510
Everyone is in your pocket.

595
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,340
Except for me and Archie.

596
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:33,470
You won't keep us apart. But right now,

597
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,480

Stop the riot.

Let go of him!

00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:04,860
Wait.

614
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:09,320
What's happening?
Where's Mad Dog? His stuff?

615
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,320
Oh, you didn't hear?
Mad Dog died in the riot.

616
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:14,570
The one you started.

617
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:18,830
No, that's impossible.
Mad Dog wasn't even there.

618
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:33,260
- It'll never end with him, will it?
- Daddy Dearest, you mean?

619
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,590
He's obsessed
with keeping me and Archie apart.

620
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,890
I can't even go visit him anymore.

621
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:41,100
Apparently he put my name
on a do-not-admit list.

622
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,020
Get a new name.

623
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:47,110
Before leaving on my iconic road trip
to California with Toni,

624
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,900
Reggie got us fake IDs,
to get into the Viper Room.

625
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:51,150
He'd hook you up, too.

626
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,700
You blew us off, Ethel.

627
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:01,540
And you knew where the missing Scout
was, and didn't say anything to anyone.

628
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,659
Also, you and Ben
aren't really dating.

629
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:05,290
Yes, we are.
We're in love.

630
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:07,830
No, Ethel, you were playing a game.
Role-playing.

631
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,250
That's what you don't get.

632
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,340
It was more real than you'll understand.

633
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:14,510
Ethel, we're trying to help you,
but you have to stop lying.

634
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,050
- I'm not lying.
- Okay.

635
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,470
Let's go to the sheriff's station.

636
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:21,140
You can put that truth on record
to Sheriff Minetta.

637
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,331
Look, if any of us
talk to any grown-ups,

638
00:37:23,382 --> 00:37:25,190
he's gonna get
very, very angry.

639
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,560
Who, Ethel?

640
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:28,310
Look what happened to Dilton.

641
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,110
He tried to talk to you, then he...

642
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:32,990
[Betty] Ethel?

643
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:34,610
Ethel?

644
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:36,320
Oh, my God.

645
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:39,200
- She's having a seizure.
- Call an ambulance.

646
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,490
- Weatherbee!
- Ethel.

647
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,080
It's okay.

648
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:45,080
- Help is coming, okay?
- Yeah, hi. Uh...

649
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:49,250
We have a girl that's having a seizure,
at Riverdale High. Send an ambulance.

650
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:53,760
You've got ten minutes.

651
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:08,690
Hello, Archie.

652
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:11,320
My name is Monica Posh.

653
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,030
I'm with Riverdale's chapter
of the Innocence Project

654
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:16,780
I'll be working
to get you out of this place.

655
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:23,410
Welcome, Cadets, to the RROTC.

656
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:24,580
Excuse me, Major Mason?

657
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,790
My name's Kevin Keller.
Hope it's not too late to join.

658
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:30,790
Keller. You Tom Keller's boy?

659
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,170
- I am, sir.
- [Mason] Hell.

660
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:35,590
Tom and I were in the RROTC together,
back in the day.

661
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:38,590
Come on in, son.
Take a seat. We'll get started.

662
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,020
[man] Open it.

663
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:01,700
You caused quite the
commotion in my yard.

664
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:04,240
You sent three of my
men to the infirmary.

665
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:05,580
Where's Mad Dog, warden?

666
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:08,250
Captain Golightly said he died
in the riot,

667
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:10,080
when he wasn't even there.

668
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:11,330
What did you do to him?

669
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,130
Save that righteous anger, young man.

670
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:17,550
You're going to need it.

671
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:21,260
You impressed me today.

672
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,220
- Proved you have what it takes.
- What's happening?

673
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,260
You've been tapped.

674
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,020
You're gonna be my new Mad Dog.

675
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:35,610
Some of you know why we're here.

676
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:38,780
And some of us are sworn enemies.

677
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:41,030
But we made a vow in high school.

678
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:43,910
Now that the Scout is back,
safe and sound, thank God...

679
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:46,620
we can only assume
that he'll start talking,

680
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:49,080
and that whatever he says
might lead back to us.

681
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:53,670
To the secret that we buried,
all those years ago.

682
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,340
Why are you talking about this?

683
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:59,130
This hasn't been made public yet, Fred,
but Dilton Doiley and Ben Button...

684
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,800
were found in the woods with blue lips.

685
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,930
Dilton is dead.

686
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:08,390
Ben is in a coma.

687
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,890
Don't you keep Sheriff Minetta
on a short leash?

688
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:15,190
- Can't you just make this all go away?
- We control Minetta, yes.

689
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:17,270
- Jughead found the body.
- That's the concern.

690
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,150
We talked with Jughead and Betty,
told them to stop.

691
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,200
But you know how crazy our kids can be.

692
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,450
We made a pact
to never revisit that night.

693
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:26,910
Not to mention it,
not to even think about it.

694
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:30,290
- My vote is we stick to that.
- We might not have that luxury, Tom.

695
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:33,460
Not if it's happening again.
Not if it's our children.

696
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,920
All our children.

697
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,420
They're in danger.

698
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,220
[Betty] Mrs. Muggs said Ethel's resting.

699
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,050
It just doesn't make sense, Jug.

700
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:50,430
It can't be a coincidence,
but seizures aren't contagious.

701
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,980
So... what? What is it?

702
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,650
Sounds like another mystery
for us to solve.

703
00:40:58,270 --> 00:40:59,270
If you're up for it.

704
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:01,400
I am.

705
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,860
And maybe it's the same one.

706
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:07,740
Maybe there's a connection
between the seizures

707
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:09,830
and whatever happened to Dilton, and...

708
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:13,460
Do you wanna check on Ben
while we're here?

709
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:19,880
Ben?

710
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:21,880
[Jughead] Ben.

711
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,340
Hey, what are you doing?
Come away from the window.

712
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:27,340
It's okay. Everything's okay.

713
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,600
I know.

714
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:32,220
I know it is.
I'm gonna be with Dilton now.

715
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:34,140
We both flipped the coin.

716
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:37,060
He was scared to ascend, but I'm not.

717
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:40,480
What about...?
What about your Princess Etheline, huh?

718
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:41,570
We'll be reunited.

719
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,440
In the Kingdom.

720
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:45,490
One day, all of us will.

721
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:46,950
It's all part of his plan.

722
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:48,320
- You'll see.
- Ben.

723
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:49,990
Soon.

724
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:52,910
- You'll fly, too.
- [Betty] Ben, no!

725
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:55,660
[glass breaking, car alarm wailing]
