1
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:09,658
Previously on Riverdale:

2
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:12,721
Ladies, gentlemen. Been months
in the making, but we're here.

3
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:14,264
Welcome to the new Southside.

4
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,307
You asking me to join the Serpents?

5
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:18,685
I wondered how you felt
about being my queen.

6
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:22,230
I'll sell the Whyte Wyrm to you,
for Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe.

7
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:23,857
No more evil.

8
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,359
You have no power over me.

9
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:30,530
I have someone who can help you, Mom,
from the Farm.

10
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:33,491
Needs a lot of work, Dad.
But I'm up for it if you are.

11
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:36,161
And your new student
body president, Archie Andrews.

12
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:40,623
You got Andre to kill that boy
at Shadow Lake, Cassidy.

13
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,334
When I do prove this,
I'll just come for you.

14
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:47,088
Steps have been taken to dissolve
the glue that holds them together.

15
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,506
Sheriff, what are you doing?

16
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:52,177
You're under arrest for the murder
of Shadow Lake resident Cassidy Bullock.

17
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,141
It's the
calm before the storm.

18
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:01,102
The summer before your junior year
in high school.

19
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:03,021
And how do you spend it?

20
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,148
Working some brutal summer job

21
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:08,234
that actually makes you look forward
to going back to school.

22
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:13,323
Or maybe you have an internship
that doesn't pay much.

23
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:16,785
That's okay,
because it's for a good cause.

24
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,149
- Focus on that.
- No, no. See what I mean?

25
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:22,999
Or... maybe you spent it
at Sweetwater Swimming Hole.

26
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:27,337
You... and the best friends
you'll ever have.

27
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:33,885
Or maybe you spent most of June,
July, August in a courtroom,

28
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,013
supporting our pal, Archie Andrews,

29
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,432
who was on trial
for a murder he didn't commit,

30
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:42,060
despite the DA's closing arguments.

31
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:44,270
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

32
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,855
the evidence and testimony

33
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:49,442
that was presented
in this court tell a dark story.

34
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:53,113
That Mr. Andrews has a history
of violent behavior.

35
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:56,699
That he started not one,
but two masked vigilante groups.

36
00:01:57,867 --> 00:02:00,662
That he assaulted an innocent boy,

37
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:02,664
who was helpless with two broken legs.

38
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:06,709
That he went wilding
in the Southside of town,

39
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,379
and threatened to shoot a young man
in the face.

40
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:13,716
That while partying with his friends
in the town of Shadow Lake,

41
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,885
Mr. Andrews ran into the woods

42
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:19,139
and shot the victim, Cassidy Bullock,
point-blank in the head.

43
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,100
Now, Mr. Andrews claims

44
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:26,020
that it was his girlfriend's father's
doorman who shot Mr. Bullock.

45
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:30,108
A shot Mr. Andrews claims
to have heard, but not seen.

46
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,362
Who knows the truth of what happened

47
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:37,073
that terrible night
in the woods near Shadow Lake?

48
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,575
I'll tell you who.

49
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,368
That man.

50
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:44,080
Archie Andrews may be a varsity athlete,

51
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,040
and he may be a sensitive musician...

52
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:48,835
but he is also...

53
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:53,590
a cold-blooded killer.

54
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:05,351
Ladies and gentlemen, we know for a fact

55
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:10,148
that Archie Andrews constantly puts
the needs of others ahead of his own.

56
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:14,527
We know that he helped
to solve the murder of Jason Blossom.

57
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:18,573
We know that he offered both friends
and enemies shelter

58
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,408
when they had nowhere else to stay.

59
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,953
We know that he punched
through a river of ice

60
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,581
to save the life
of his classmate Cheryl Blossom.

61
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:32,003
Well, let me remind you that there
were no witnesses to the actual killing.

62
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,006
There was no murder weapon.
There is no motive.

63
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:37,926
At the end of the day,
all the prosecution has

64
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:41,471
is cloudy testimony
from unreliable people.

65
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:46,059
Now, it is my solemn duty,
as a mother, to protect my son.

66
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:51,564
But as an attorney,
it's my duty to adhere to the facts,

67
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:53,233
to the evidence.

68
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,151
There is nothing here that proves

69
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:59,906
that Archie Andrews is anything less
than an innocent boy.

70
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:02,992
Thank you.

71
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,208
Thanks, Mom.

72
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,878
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
the charge is first-degree murder.

73
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,839
You may retire
to begin your deliberations.

74
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:20,969
All rise.

75
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,185
Okay, can you just level with us, Mom?

76
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,562
What do you think Archie's chances are?

77
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,315
Baby, I'd say fifty-fifty.

78
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,193
If you had to come down
on a side, Mrs. McCoy?

79
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,696
- You were great in there, Mary.
- Thank you, Fred.

80
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,115
It's only the most important case
of our lives.

81
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,908
You were amazing, Mrs. Andrews.

82
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:47,120
Well, Betty,
your help this summer was a godsend.

83
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,122
Have you guys seen Archie?

84
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:11,602
Archie?

85
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,564
There you are.

86
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:17,525
How you holding up?

87
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,027
Yeah, good, Jug.

88
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,071
What were you thinking about just now?

89
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,991
How you're gonna walk out
of this courthouse a free man?

90
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:26,534
No, I...

91
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,537
There was this place...

92
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:33,041
we've never been before, Ronnie,
but Betty and Jug,

93
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,959
remember Sweetwater Swimming Hole?

94
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:38,046
- We went every summer.
- I was just thinking about that place.

95
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,673
Yeah, me too. What made us stop going?

96
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,301
Oh.
Probably when we got covered in leeches.

97
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,220
Was that us, or was that a movie?

98
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,904
- Definitely us.
- That was us.

99
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,183
I'd like to go.

100
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,311
- Hopefully you can take me, Archie?
- Hopefully.

101
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:54,896
Guys.

102
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,857
It's time.
Judge asked us back into the courtroom.

103
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,820
The jury is still deliberating.

104
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,033
But I've dismissed them.

105
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,535
They're sequestered,
and I've instructed them

106
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:13,706
not to read anything about this case,
nor to discuss it with anyone.

107
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,667
We'll reconvene Tuesday morning,
after Labor Day.

108
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,756
My advice to you, young man,

109
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:26,844
is to spend this weekend with
your family and your loved ones.

110
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:30,598
That's all.

111
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:33,976
This just buys us more time
to figure out what we need next.

112
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:37,438
Hey, Archie.

113
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,360
- Have a terrific weekend.
- Fred!

114
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,195
- Dad, stop.
- No, no.

115
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,738
Guys, guys. Come on.

116
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,740
Hey, stop.

117
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,369
Enjoy.

118
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:52,578
Thanks, Pop.

119
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,627
Dilton. Ben.
What are you guys playing?

120
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,088
- It's called Gryffins...
- Shut up, Doiley.

121
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:08,302
If we could only find the gun
that Andre used to kill Cassidy.

122
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,004
I've torn
The Pembrooke apart.

123
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:13,266
After the riots, my father wiped any
and all traces of Andre.

124
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,301
He wouldn't have brought it back
from Shadow Lake.

125
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:18,938
- That's probably where he ditched it.
- So, we go back to Shadow Woods?

126
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:22,442
- We've looked.
- Let's look again. With metal detectors.

127
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,777
If we get Andre's gun,
we can plant it on...

128
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:25,862
- No.
- No.

129
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,490
I don't wanna do that,
spend what could be my last weekend

130
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:32,618
looking for evidence that isn't there,
planting it who-knows-where.

131
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:36,247
Archie, we have three extra days
to prove that you're innocent.

132
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,793
- What would you have us do, Archie?
- What the judge said.

133
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,670
After the worst summer ever,

134
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:45,882
I want us to have a great,
normal Labor Day weekend.

135
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,926
Can we do that?

136
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,430
If that's what you really want,
Archiekins.

137
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:53,514
It is, Ronnie.

138
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:55,266
So, what should we do?

139
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:58,978
♪ Like it or not ♪

140
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,814
♪ When I get going
They know where I'm gonna stop ♪

141
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:05,234
♪ That's what I do
Like it or not ♪

142
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,905
♪ That's who I am
That's who I be, that's what I got ♪

143
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,699
Greetings, chums. I
wanted to let you know

144
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:14,368
that after the three amazing months
I had with Toni,

145
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,037
riding motorcycles cross-country,

146
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,457
we're celebrating with an epic
end-of-summer pool party at Thornhill.

147
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,541
You're all invited.

148
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:24,587
Of course, given the fact that Archie will
most likely be walking the green mile

149
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,548
while the rest of us
are walking the stage at graduation,

150
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,300
I understand if you're not up for it.

151
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,761
Invite who you want,
but give them fair warning:

152
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,555
I'm in the mood for some hell-raising.
Toodles.

153
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:37,308
♪ La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la ♪

154
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:41,103
♪ Like it or not now
That's who I am ♪

155
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:52,156
So, you've written down
your words for the release ritual?

156
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,533
Yeah. How about you?

157
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,077
- I'm working on it.
- Betty. Come.

158
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:59,497
Have some milk oolong tea.
It's an incredible detoxifier.

159
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,666
No, I'm okay, thanks.

160
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:04,460
Where are you off to?
Another therapy session?

161
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,421
No, Dr. Glass is tomorrow.
I'm going over to Archie's.

162
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,632
Honey, before you go back to school,

163
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:13,302
I think it's important that you spend
some quality family time together.

164
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:17,306
- Edgar thinks it's important.
- Oh, yeah. Edgar from the Farm.

165
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,768
No. Yeah. We'll...
We'll talk about that later, Mom.

166
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,980
Can I just say, Mr. Andrews,

167
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:27,358
watching you punch Hiram Lodge
in the face was...

168
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,236
incredibly cathartic.

169
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,321
Almost got me landed in jail.

170
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,659
All right, give it a try.

171
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,035
You do the honors.

172
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,258
Yeah. There you go.

173
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,761
- We did it, Dad.
- Yeah, we did.

174
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,263
We sure did.

175
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,681
Just in time.

176
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,894
Guys, excuse me a second.
I'm gonna go in the house.

177
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:09,900
Betty.

178
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:14,238
I have to ask you a favor.

179
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,073
If I do go away...

180
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:20,536
will you check on my dad?
Invite him over for dinner?

181
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,413
Once my mom goes to Chicago,
he'll be alone.

182
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:23,331
Arch.

183
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:27,793
The jury is still deliberating.
That's a good sign, okay?

184
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:30,463
You don't need to put
your house in order.

185
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:31,797
Betty, promise me.

186
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:33,299
Please.

187
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,218
Of course.

188
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,066
It's not gonna work, Daddy.

189
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:54,403
Your Iago-like attempt
to keep me and Archie apart?

190
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,239
It'll fail.

191
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,617
Veronica,
I've no idea what you're talking about.

192
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,826
How about a refresher?

193
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,122
Framing Archie for murder.

194
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:07,958
Conspiring to keep him locked away.

195
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,002
You set all of this in motion.

196
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,754
I know it, everyone knows it.

197
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,756
Only you can stop it.

198
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,050
So, stop it.

199
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:18,678
Do it now.

200
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,263
But, mija, I have nothing
to do with this.

201
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,392
That boy is a criminal
with a history of violence.

202
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,518
He's innocent.

203
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,144
You know he is.

204
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,231
He doesn't deserve this.

205
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,359
He'll be alone in there.
He'll die in there.

206
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,861
- Archie brought that upon himself.
- No. You.

207
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,446
You can change everything.

208
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,241
Please, Daddy.

209
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:43,911
- It's beyond my control.
- I'm begging you, as your only daughter:

210
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,413
Help Archie.

211
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,415
Save him.

212
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,500
Please.

213
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:54,171
It's simply beyond my control.

214
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:03,472
We know Hiram took over the Southside,
'cause he's colluding with the Ghoulies.

215
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,267
But I need to know
what he's up to exactly.

216
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,063
All right, Fangs, you're up. I need
you to find the Ghoulies' new lair.

217
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,691
If you see them, don't engage with them.

218
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:16,944
This is just a recon mission.
Can't be risking another gang war.

219
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,822
I just need confirmation
that what Hiram's up to

220
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,158
has nothing to do with the Serpents
or Riverdale High.

221
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,452
Will do. You got it.

222
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,413
Hey, boy. Come have a look.

223
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,749
Might be my best one yet.

224
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,042
How's it feel to be an honorary Serpent?

225
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,461
Feels pretty savage, Jug.

226
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:38,340
Archie, the first thing I learned
at Southside High

227
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,926
was that you need to roll with a crew
to survive.

228
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,137
There'll be Serpents
in juvenile detention.

229
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,139
Find them. Sit with them.

230
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,515
That tattoo's gonna get you in,

231
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,977
- but it's also gonna get you protected.
- Yeah, Jughead's right.

232
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,437
Up to a point.

233
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,482
Serpent ink will help
keep your body safe,

234
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,443
but you still gotta worry
about protecting this?

235
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,069
I speak from experience.

236
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:02,406
Your mind is the first thing
that goes when you're locked up.

237
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,076
But if you can keep your head on
straight, you can get through anything.

238
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,453
You just...

239
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,791
gotta keep your wits about you, Red.

240
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:25,221
Mom, what are you doing with my diaries?

241
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,807
I was telling Edgar about them,
and he feels,

242
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,309
and I agree, you should burn them.

243
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,478
What are you talking about? Why?

244
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,438
You've been filling these pages

245
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:37,107
with so much pain
and suffering over the years.

246
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,734
You need to let that go.

247
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:42,530
Okay, Dr. Glass says journaling
is a perfectly healthy outlet.

248
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:46,992
And I respect what your therapist says,
Betty, but these diaries are your past.

249
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,119
And your past is crushing you.

250
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,247
- Edgar says that...
- What, Mom?

251
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,166
What does some guru
who's running a Heaven's Gate commune

252
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,710
for pregnant runaways
and wives of serial killers

253
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,254
have to say about my diaries?

254
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,589
We know that you look down
on the Farm, Betty.

255
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,259
But Edgar has done nothing but help me.

256
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:07,221
He's encouraged me to embrace everything
that I was ashamed of,

257
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,932
- and become the best version of myself.
- Mom,

258
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,059
- I can't deal with this right now.
- But...

259
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,396
Isn't that the problem?
You're not dealing with it.

260
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,314
The trauma from last year,

261
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:20,526
what happened with your father,
that Chic person?

262
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:24,488
You're running around a mile a minute,
and you need to be sitting still.

263
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,616
Listening to
what your soul is telling you.

264
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,203
Okay, I'm listening to my soul.

265
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,621
And what it's saying is:

266
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:36,000
"Get the hell away from your mother.
She's been body-snatched."

267
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,718
There's something else
you should know about Betty, Mom.

268
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:52,057
♪ I'm pickin' up good vibrations ♪

269
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:55,102
♪ She's giving me the excitations ♪

270
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:57,479
- ♪ I'm pickin' up good vibrations ♪
- ♪ Oom, bop, bop ♪

271
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,398
♪ Good vibrations ♪

272
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,650
Hey, Josie, never thought I'd say this,

273
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,903
but I'm excited for school
to start back up.

274
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,147
Mostly 'cause I'll get to see you
in the halls every day.

275
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:09,408
Sweet Pea,
I told you when we started this,

276
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:12,369
our summer fling was gonna be just that,
a fling.

277
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,830
With a three-month expiration date.

278
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,958
Yeah, I know,
but haven't we been having a good time?

279
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,377
I'm not saying we haven't.

280
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,879
But nothing,

281
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:26,258
not even a tall, cool drink
of sweet water like you,

282
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,427
is gonna distract me from my music.

283
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:32,348
♪ When I look in her eyes ♪

284
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:36,101
♪ She goes with me to a blossom world ♪

285
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:41,565
So, Moose, you know those movies
where friends make a pact

286
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,769
to lose their virginity
by the end of the school year?

287
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,402
I've been thinking,

288
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,696
since we've been hanging
out all summer...

289
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,866
maybe we should make a similar pact
of our own,

290
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,577
but on a slightly accelerated timetable.

291
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,663
Like, by Halloween at the latest.

292
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:07,049
Reg, if I do go away,
you gotta step up and lead the Bulldogs.

293
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:08,968
I'm already captain, bro.

294
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,096
Yeah, I'm not talking
about on the field.

295
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:15,849
Work with Jughead to keep the peace
between the Serpents and the Bulldogs.

296
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:19,186
No more Circles...
Red, Dark, or otherwise.

297
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,939
Done. That bloody chapter is over.

298
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,066
Sick tat, by the way.

299
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:27,611
♪ I don't know where
But she sends me there ♪

300
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:31,448
♪ Oh, my, my, what a sensation ♪

301
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:34,618
♪ Oh, my, my, what elation ♪

302
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,460
- What you thinking about, babe?
- Archie Andrews.

303
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,757
He saved my life, Tee-Tee.

304
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:53,554
What happened that day on the river,
Cheryl... we've never talked about it.

305
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,224
I lost hope.

306
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:00,310
And I did something really stupid.

307
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,941
Archie Andrews was there to save me.

308
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,364
And now there's nothing I,
or anyone, can do to help him.

309
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:22,416
V?

310
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,044
Are you okay?

311
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,504
I went to see Mrs. Andrews
and Attorney McCoy...

312
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,674
to ask them to put me on that stand.

313
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:35,179
I wanted to get in front of that jury
to tell them the truth

314
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,305
about my father...

315
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,767
to see if that might make a difference,
but they said no.

316
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:41,894
That I was too late.

317
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,520
Maybe not, Veronica.

318
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,064
Josie.

319
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,566
Look, you didn't hear
this from me, but...

320
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:51,528
the jury's sequestered
at the Five Seasons, third floor.

321
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,030
Room 301.

322
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,531
And security's tight, but...

323
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,450
I think I can get you in.

324
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,453
What are you thinking, V?

325
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,456
That I only need to get
to one jury member

326
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:06,126
to convince them that my Dad's
the villain here, not Archie,

327
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,336
for there to be a hung jury.

328
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,506
Which would give us more time
to prove Archie's innocent.

329
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,271
Jughead.

330
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,857
- What's up?
- It's the Ghoulies.

331
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,359
Those bastards have Hot Dog.

332
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,530
Are you absolutely
sure this was Hot Dog?

333
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,658
Hundred percent, man.
They must've snatched him on Riot Night.

334
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:40,911
He looked skinny. Don't think
the Ghoulies feed him enough.

335
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:43,789
Lucky those animals
aren't slow-roasting him on a grill.

336
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:46,583
- What do we do, Jughead?
- We'd be going behind enemy lines,

337
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,128
outnumbered,
open to attack from all directions,

338
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,671
and risking another gang war.

339
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:55,509
No Serpent left behind.
That includes our spirit animal.

340
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:58,303
Okay. We deploy after dark.
It'll be a stealth mission.

341
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,588
- Gonna be quick.
- Jug.

342
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,765
Last time you went into
Ghoulie territory,

343
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,184
you were beaten
to within an inch of your life.

344
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,136
- He'll have backup.
- We'll be quick.

345
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:09,106
- They won't even know we were there.
- I'm coming with you.

346
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:11,525
- No.
- No. Don't you dare tell me

347
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,152
that it's too dangerous, Jug.

348
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,779
The Serpent Queen is a warrior queen.

349
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,407
So, if you're on the
front lines, so am I.

350
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,120
Okay.

351
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,292
Let's bring Hot Dog home, shall we?

352
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:35,340
We tried to stack the jury
in Archie's favor.

353
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:38,302
Women, mothers. But I don't know.

354
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,595
Maybe it backfired.

355
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,723
Mary, you did everything that you could.

356
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,225
I don't know, Fred.

357
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:49,146
I just think if I hadn't left Riverdale,
if I hadn't gone to Chicago...

358
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:53,650
I was here and I couldn't stop Hiram Lodge
from getting his claws into our son.

359
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,110
Dad, Mom.

360
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,655
Don't blame yourselves for what I did.

361
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,950
Taking Hiram's side against you, Dad,
was the biggest mistake I've ever made.

362
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,702
But it was mine. It's on me.

363
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:08,040
You guys are the best parents
anyone could ask for.

364
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:10,584
Everything you've done for me,
I don't deserve it.

365
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,588
Whatever happens to me on Tuesday
is what I deserve.

366
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:17,007
No. You are a good kid.

367
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:20,302
You got manipulated by a mobster.

368
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:23,055
But you do not deserve
to be framed for murder.

369
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,473
Your mom... Son.

370
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,018
Your mother and I will always love you.

371
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,409
Housekeeping.

372
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,203
Moonlighting, Ms. Lodge?

373
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:48,914
Sheriff Minetta.

374
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:51,959
I have to say, your
father knows you well.

375
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,503
He anticipated you might pull a stunt
like this.

376
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,713
Jury tampering?

377
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,799
Pero para Dios, what were you thinking?

378
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:01,426
What I've been thinking
for the past three months.

379
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,596
Archie. How do I help Archie?

380
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,391
Daddy's a monster, Mom. You know he is.

381
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:11,311
But you just stand by him, complacent,
like some Park Avenue trophy wife.

382
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:18,860
With all due respect, Veronica,
you're his daughter.

383
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:23,031
Now, that affords you a certain amount
of protection that I don't enjoy.

384
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,826
He'll never harm a hair on your head.

385
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,036
I can't say the same for myself.

386
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:33,917
I won't leave you alone
in the world with him.

387
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:37,462
- Mom...
- I'm a prisoner, Veronica.

388
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,133
But I am not his puppet.

389
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,225
It's been an hour,
and no sign of anyone.

390
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:52,728
All right. Sweet Pea?

391
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,771
You guys keep lookout.

392
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:08,368
Hey.

393
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:09,828
Hey, bud.

394
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:11,288
Hey.

395
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:13,874
Hi, buddy.

396
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,339
Hiya, Jonesy.

397
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,050
Welcome back to the Southside.

398
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:26,136
- Cheryl...
- Not yet, cousin.

399
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,889
I thought this mangy mutt might get you
to show up.

400
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,435
- We need to talk.
- No, we don't, Penny.

401
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,887
- I'm here for the dog.
- If you didn't want trouble,

402
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:39,316
why have you sent spies all summer
to get in our business?

403
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:42,277
Back off.
Unless you want a replay of Riot Night.

404
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:47,282
Yeah. I've been sending scouts.
I was looking for Hot Dog.

405
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,034
Now that I got him...

406
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,370
we're good.

407
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,040
Not so fast.

408
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:00,712
Your jacket.

409
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,508
The Southside isn't yours anymore.

410
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:07,594
You're no longer the Southside Serpents.

411
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,471
Really, Penny? A jacket?

412
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,100
We could always just take it
off your limp, dead body.

413
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:18,313
I also heard Ponytail's a Serpent now,
your Northside queen.

414
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,149
Maybe we'll go after her next.

415
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,027
Fine. You can have the jacket,

416
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:26,780
as long as you and the Ghoulies
stay out of the Northside.

417
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:28,782
Oh, you don't get to make demands.

418
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:31,368
Cheryl!

419
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:33,620
Told you I'm in the
mood for hell-raising.

420
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,332
That's it. Just kill them all.

421
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,085
Cheryl, aim your next arrow
between Penny's eyes.

422
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:46,716
You and your Ghoulies take one step,
she'll release the arrow.

423
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,303
Cheryl doesn't miss.

424
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,060
Congratulations.

425
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,729
You just made the Northside fair game.

426
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,112
- Come on.
- Little doggie.

427
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,323
See you soon, Jonesy.

428
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:14,703
Come here.

429
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:16,037
Hey. Come here.

430
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:18,707
Come here, boy.

431
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:23,253
Right, let's go.

432
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,005
Wait, stop.

433
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:35,307
Hey.

434
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:36,892
Wait, stop.

435
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:49,362
That was...

436
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,728
Hey, Dilton came by to see you.

437
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:23,980
He did?

438
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:26,858
- What for? Did he say?
- No, he wouldn't talk.

439
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:28,527
Weird kid.

440
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:29,986
No kidding.

441
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:32,489
So, how's Hot Dog?

442
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:36,243
Sleeping under the trailer,
but he's bouncing back.

443
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:37,160
Yeah?

444
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:39,496
How are you?

445
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,501
Uneasy sits the crown?

446
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:46,962
Well...

447
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,633
Penny's got the Northside in her sights,

448
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,301
Cheryl's a loose cannon...

449
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,680
Betty is a target, and...

450
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,696
We're not the Southside
Serpents anymore.

451
00:26:01,747 --> 00:26:02,944
Screw the Southside.

452
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:04,813
You're a Serpent...

453
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:06,523
by blood,

454
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:09,734
and no one can take that from you,
or any one of us.

455
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:15,699
The pharmacy called. Polly answered.

456
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:18,118
They can't complete
an Adderall prescription

457
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,869
that was requested by your doctor

458
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,831
because you had one refilled
in Greendale two weeks ago.

459
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,335
Then they must have
mixed up their dates.

460
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,420
I don't know.

461
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:29,921
I'll call Dr. Glass.

462
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,631
Except there is no Dr. Glass.

463
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,009
Polly did some digging.

464
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,302
He doesn't exist.

465
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:38,138
You've been forging prescriptions
for yourself.

466
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,765
We're worried about you, Betty.

467
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,934
You've been lying about
going to therapy,

468
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,979
now you're making up a psychiatrist
to scam medication.

469
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:47,522
Seriously, Mom?

470
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:50,859
You give me a hard time
for trying to re-up a prescription

471
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,069
that you shoved into
my hands a year ago?

472
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:56,364
It was before Edgar explained
the dangers of pharmaceuticals.

473
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,743
Okay, enough.
You're actually buying this Farm crap

474
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:03,038
that some huckster
named Edgar Evernever is selling you.

475
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,372
He's helping us move on.

476
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,958
- And he can help you, too, sweetheart.
- Oh, really?

477
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:10,837
Oolong milk and wanting
to burn my diaries

478
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,841
is helping you get over the fact
that Dad murdered four people

479
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,509
and tried to kill us?

480
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:20,138
If you genuinely believe that,
you are in denial, Mom.

481
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,431
No, Betty. You are.

482
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:26,019
Do you realize that that is the first
time you've mentioned Dad in months?

483
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:28,188
You call me and my friends crazy,

484
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:31,274
but you're the one with a secret life,
hoarding stolen drugs,

485
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:32,776
hiding from your pain.

486
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,402
You may hate the Farm...

487
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:38,782
but they healed me,
they healed Mom, and they can heal you.

488
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:42,160
But first, you need to admit
that you're sick.

Guys, no matter what happens in court...

509
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:11,291
this... is the best last day of summer
a guy could ask for.

510
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:14,711
Archie.

511
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,841
What if you make a break for it?

512
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:26,306
Past that tree line is a road that
goes through the mountains to Quebec.

513
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:28,308
- Jughead.
- Serpents north of the border

514
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:29,642
will keep you supplied.

515
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,562
You don't deserve this, Arch.

516
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,272
Any of it.

517
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:35,398
And what if I do?

518
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:38,985
- Why would you say that?
- Because I'm guilty.

519
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,239
I didn't kill Cassidy.

520
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,201
But I left him alone with Andre.

521
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:49,120
If I hadn't walked away that night,
he might still be alive.

522
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,331
And not just Cassidy, all of it.

523
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:52,874
All of last year.

524
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,048
I didn't kill anyone.

525
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,052
But I could've.

526
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,186
I have to take responsibility for that.

527
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:20,068
Jug, I'm not ready
for summer to be over.

528
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:22,779
I don't think I can handle it.

529
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:26,032
What do you mean? Sure you can.

530
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:30,370
Jug, this summer, I haven't stopped,

531
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:33,665
or slept a wink, working
on Archie's case.

532
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,918
I've barely looked up since May, and...

533
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:42,632
My mom and Polly think
that I've been... hiding,

534
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:45,468
or avoiding, and they're right.

535
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:51,349
Maybe I should stop taking Adderall,
start seeing a therapist for real.

536
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,811
Either way, come Tuesday,
it'll all be over,

537
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:57,689
and I'll have to face everything.

538
00:30:57,772 --> 00:31:01,943
Everything that has happened,
everything that will happen.

539
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:06,239
All these things
that I don't have control over,

540
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,950
they just terrify me.

541
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:10,952
Betty.

542
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:13,162
We're gonna get through it.

543
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:18,877
From now on, we're partners.

544
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:22,338
In Serpents, in life...

545
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,883
All of it. Okay?

546
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:07,342
Ronnie.

547
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:12,639
Whatever you're about to say, Archie,
please, don't make me cry.

548
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:18,061
If I do go away,
I don't want you visiting me

549
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,563
in that horrible place, okay?

550
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:24,651
Oh. Rest assured,
if the unthinkable happens,

551
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:28,196
I will be taking the bus every week,
with all the other prison widows,

552
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,907
and bringing you Magnolia cupcakes
from New York.

553
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,201
As well as working on your appeal.
I promise.

554
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,577
That's what I don't want,

555
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:37,246
you spending the rest
of high school waiting for me.

556
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,083
No. You are not breaking up
with me tonight, Archie.

557
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,292
- Ronnie, I...
- Archie.

558
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:45,296
I am not letting my dad take away
the one thing that I love.

559
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,591
It's not happening.

560
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,101
You know, it's weird, Ronnie.

561
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:03,940
The thing that keeps me up most nights
isn't that I might get shivved.

562
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:10,530
It's that I won't
graduate with you guys.

563
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:15,994
It's stupid, right?

564
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,916
I don't think that's stupid at all.

565
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,639
Are you ready, Archie?

566
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,267
Hey, come here.

567
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,061
Be a good boy, okay?

568
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:44,439
Good boy.

569
00:33:58,953 --> 00:33:59,787
Hey.

570
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:06,794
- Mr. Jones, is Jughead home?
- I'll get the bikes warm. Hurry up.

571
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,255
Look, Dilton,
now's not really a good time, okay?

572
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:11,591
Ben and I... We thought
it was just a game.

573
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:15,344
A stupid role-playing game, but
it's not. It's so much more.

574
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,389
He's real.

575
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,307
Who?

576
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:21,768
Who is?

577
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,395
Look, I gotta get to Archie's trial.

578
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:26,856
The Gargoyle King.

579
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:33,988
Look, I can't talk right now.

580
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,908
Wanna wait here for a little bit?

581
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,701
Try and get some rest? Yeah? Okay?

582
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:41,788
We can talk about this when I get back.

583
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:42,872
- All right?
- Yeah.

584
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:51,923
All rise.

585
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:01,474
Has the jury reached a verdict?

586
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:05,812
Your Honor, we haven't.

587
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:08,523
- What does that mean?
- We're deadlocked, six-to-six.

588
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:10,817
And it's not gonna change.

589
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:14,987
So be it.

590
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,572
The jury is dismissed.

591
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,658
Thank you for your service.

592
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,287
So, what happens now?

593
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:26,051
- Judge will declare a mistrial.
- We have to go through this again?

594
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:28,835
Your Honor.

595
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,087
In lieu of another trial,

596
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:34,173
the State is prepared
to offer a deal for a lesser sentence.

597
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:38,261
Instead of prison, time served,
plus two years in juvenile detention,

598
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:42,682
if Mr. Andrews will plead guilty
to the crime of manslaughter.

599
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:44,225
- Your Honor...
- I'll take the deal.

600
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,601
- No, Archie.
- Archie.

601
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,186
- We have to discuss this.
- Mom.

602
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:50,231
I can't put you
and everyone else through this again.

603
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,359
Your Honor, I accept the deal.

604
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,653
Son, just so I have it straight,

605
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:57,864
though it's legally within your rights,

606
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:00,366
you're ignoring the advice
of your counsel,

607
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:01,450
your own mother.

608
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,327
Yes, Your Honor. I'm guilty.

609
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:10,501
Mr. Andrews,
the court accepts your plea of guilty.

610
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:13,254
You'll be taken directly
from the courthouse

611
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:16,090
to the Leopold and Loeb
Juvenile Detention Center,

612
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:19,844
where you will serve out your sentence,
beginning immediately.

613
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,387
Court is adjourned.

614
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,435
- I'm sorry, Mom.
- Oh, Archie. I love you so much.

615
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:31,439

I'll file it from Chicago,
and as soon as we get a date...

629
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:38,798
We'll get him home, Mary.
One way or another.

630
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,633
You have our word.

631
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:48,015
I'll prove that Hiram Lodge framed our
son and make the son of a bitch pay.

632
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:51,686
Whatever it takes.

633
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,410
This is Mayor Lodge.

634
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,329
Are you happy now, Daddy?

635
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:14,041
It all worked out,
just like you planned.

636
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,335
Archie didn't play by your rules.

637
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:18,921
He threatened you, so, you punished him.

638
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,965
You destroyed his life.

639
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,676
You think I did all this
to hurt Archie, mija?

640
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,846
Because he threatened me? No.

641
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:28,431
It's because you betrayed me.

642
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:34,854
This is your punishment.

643
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:38,149
You chose that boy over blood.

644
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:41,569
My own daughter.

645
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,533
You don't have a daughter anymore.

646
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:03,215
Dilton?

647
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:32,847
Dilton.

648
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,474
Dilton.

649
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,184
God.

650
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:50,531
Ben, Ben.

651
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:53,534
Hey, hey. Ben. Look at me.

652
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:55,244
Look at me. Come on.

653
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:57,663
Help! Help!

654
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:01,542
Mom?

655
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:03,961
Polly?

656
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:34,408
No.

657
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:52,092
Betty.

658
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:57,806
Oh, my God. Betty. Help.
