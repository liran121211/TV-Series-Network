00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:09,658
[narrator] Previously on Riverdale:

2
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:12,721
Ladies, gentlemen. Been months
in the making, but we're here.

3
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:14,264
Welcome to the new Southside.

4
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,307
You asking me to join the Serpents?

5
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:18,685
I wondered how you felt
about being my queen.

6
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:22,230
I'll sell the Whyte Wyrm to you,
for Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe.

7
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:23,857
[Betty] No more evil.

8
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,359
You have no power over me.

9
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:30,530
I have someone who can help you, Mom,
from the Farm.

10
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:33,491
Needs a lot of work, Dad.
But I'm up for it if you are.

11
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:36,161
[Weatherbee] And your new student
body president, Archie Andrews.

12
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:37,454
[all cheering]

13
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:40,623
You got Andre to kill that boy
at Shadow Lake, Cassidy.

14
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,334
When I do prove this,
I'll just come for you.

15
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:47,088
[Hiram] Steps have been taken to dissolve
the glue that holds them together.

16
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,506
Sheriff, what are you doing?

17
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:52,177
You're under arrest for the murder
of Shadow Lake resident Cassidy Bullock.

18
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,141
[Jughead] It's the
calm before the storm.

19
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:01,102
The summer before your junior year
in high school.

20
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:03,021
And how do you spend it?

21
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,148
Working some brutal summer job

22
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:08,234
that actually makes you look forward
to going back to school.

23
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:13,323
Or maybe you have an internship
that doesn't pay much.

24
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:16,785
That's okay,
because it's for a good cause.

25
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,149
- [woman] Focus on that.
- [Mary] No, no. See what I mean?

26
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:22,999
[Jughead] Or... maybe you spent it
at Sweetwater Swimming Hole.

27
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:27,337
You... and the best friends
you'll ever have.

28
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:33,885
Or maybe you spent most of June,
July, August in a courtroom,

29
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,013
supporting our pal, Archie Andrews,

30
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,432
who was on trial
for a murder he didn't commit,

31
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:42,060
despite the DA's closing arguments.

32
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:44,270
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

33
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,855
the evidence and testimony

34
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:49,442
that was presented
in this court tell a dark story.

35
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:53,113
That Mr. Andrews has a history
of violent behavior.

36
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:56,699
That he started not one,
but two masked vigilante groups.

37
00:01:57,867 --> 00:02:00,662
That he assaulted an innocent boy,

38
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:02,664
who was helpless with two broken legs.

39
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:06,709
That he went wilding
in the Southside of town,

40
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,379
and threatened to shoot a young man
in the face.

41
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:13,716
That while partying with his friends
in the town of Shadow Lake,

42
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,885
Mr. Andrews ran into the woods

43
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:19,139
and shot the victim, Cassidy Bullock,
point-blank in the head.

44
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,100
Now, Mr. Andrews claims

45
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:26,020
that it was his girlfriend's father's
doorman who shot Mr. Bullock.

46
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:30,108
A shot Mr. Andrews claims
to have heard, but not seen.

47
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,026
[gunshot]

48
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,362
Who knows the truth of what happened

49
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:37,073
that terrible night
in the woods near Shadow Lake?

50
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,575
I'll tell you who.

51
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,368
That man.

52
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:44,080
Archie Andrews may be a varsity athlete,

53
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,040
and he may be a sensitive musician...

54
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:48,835
but he is also...

55
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:53,590
a cold-blooded killer.

56
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:05,351
Ladies and gentlemen, we know for a fact

57
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:10,148
that Archie Andrews constantly puts
the needs of others ahead of his own.

58
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:14,527
We know that he helped
to solve the murder of Jason Blossom.

59
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:18,573
We know that he offered both friends
and enemies shelter

60
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,408
when they had nowhere else to stay.

61
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,953
We know that he punched
through a river of ice

62
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,581
to save the life
of his classmate Cheryl Blossom.

63
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:32,003
Well, let me remind you that there
were no witnesses to the actual killing.

64
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,006
There was no murder weapon.
There is no motive.

65
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:37,926
At the end of the day,
all the prosecution has

66
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:41,471
is cloudy testimony
from unreliable people.

67
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:46,059
Now, it is my solemn duty,
as a mother, to protect my son.

68
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:51,564
But as an attorney,
it's my duty to adhere to the facts,

69
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:53,233
to the evidence.

70
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,151
There is nothing here that proves

71
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:59,906
that Archie Andrews is anything less
than an innocent boy.

72
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:02,992
Thank you.

73
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,208
Thanks, Mom.

74
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,878
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
the charge is first-degree murder.

75
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,839
You may retire
to begin your deliberations.

76
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:20,969
[bailiff] All rise.

77
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,185
Okay, can you just level with us, Mom?

78
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,562
What do you think Archie's chances are?

79
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,315
Baby, I'd say fifty-fifty.

80
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,193
If you had to come down
on a side, Mrs. McCoy?

81
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,696
- You were great in there, Mary.
- Thank you, Fred.

82
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,115
It's only the most important case
of our lives.

83
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,908
You were amazing, Mrs. Andrews.

84
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:47,120
Well, Betty,
your help this summer was a godsend.

85
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,122
- [chuckles]
- Have you guys seen Archie?

86
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,334
[sighs]

87
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:11,602
[Veronica] Archie?

88
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,564
There you are.

89
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:17,525
How you holding up?

90
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,027
Yeah, good, Jug.

91
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,071
What were you thinking about just now?

92
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,991
How you're gonna walk out
of this courthouse a free man?

93
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:26,534
No, I...

94
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,537
There was this place...

95
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:33,041
we've never been before, Ronnie,
but Betty and Jug,

96
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,959
remember Sweetwater Swimming Hole?

97
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:38,046
- We went every summer.
- I was just thinking about that place.

98
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,673
Yeah, me too. What made us stop going?

99
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,301
Oh.
Probably when we got covered in leeches.

100
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,220
Was that us, or was that a movie?

101
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,904
- Definitely us.
- [Jughead] That was us.

102
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,183
I'd like to go.

103
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,311
- Hopefully you can take me, Archie?
- Hopefully.

104
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:54,896
[Kevin] Guys.

105
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,857
It's time.
Judge asked us back into the courtroom.

106
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,820
[judge] The jury is still deliberating.

107
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,033
But I've dismissed them.

108
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,535
They're sequestered,
and I've instructed them

109
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:13,706
not to read anything about this case,
nor to discuss it with anyone.

110
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,667
We'll reconvene Tuesday morning,
after Labor Day.

111
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,756
My advice to you, young man,

112
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:26,844
is to spend this weekend with
your family and your loved ones.

113
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:30,598
That's all.

114
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:33,976
This just buys us more time
to figure out what we need next.

115
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:37,438
Hey, Archie.

116
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,360
- Have a terrific weekend.
- [Mary] Fred!

117
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,195
- [Archie] Dad, stop.
- No, no.

118
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,738
Guys, guys. Come on.

119
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,740
Hey, stop.

120
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,369
Enjoy.

121
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:52,578
Thanks, Pop.

122
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,627
Dilton. Ben.
What are you guys playing?

123
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,088
- It's called Gryffins...
- Shut up, Doiley.

124
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:08,302
If we could only find the gun
that Andre used to kill Cassidy.

125
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,004
[Veronica] I've torn
The Pembrooke apart.

126
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:13,266
After the riots, my father wiped any
and all traces of Andre.

127
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,301
He wouldn't have brought it back
from Shadow Lake.

128
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:18,938
- That's probably where he ditched it.
- So, we go back to Shadow Woods?

129
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:22,442
- We've looked.
- Let's look again. With metal detectors.

130
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,777
If we get Andre's gun,
we can plant it on...

131
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:25,862
- No.
- [Archie] No.

132
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,490
I don't wanna do that,
spend what could be my last weekend

133
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:32,618
looking for evidence that isn't there,
planting it who-knows-where.

134
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:36,247
Archie, we have three extra days
to prove that you're innocent.

135
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,793
- What would you have us do, Archie?
- What the judge said.

136
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,670
After the worst summer ever,

137
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:45,882
I want us to have a great,
normal Labor Day weekend.

138
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,926
Can we do that?

139
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,430
If that's what you really want,
Archiekins.

140
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:53,514
It is, Ronnie.

141
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:55,266
So, what should we do?

[Polly] Yeah. How about you?

161
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,077
- [Alice] I'm working on it.
- [Polly] Betty. Come.

162
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:59,497
Have some milk oolong tea.
It's an incredible detoxifier.

163

No, I'm okay, thanks.

No, Dr. Glass is tomorrow.
I'm going over to Archie's.

Honey, before you go back to school,

167
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:13,302
I think it's important that you spend
some quality family time together.

168
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:17,306
- Edgar thinks it's important.
- Oh, yeah. Edgar from the Farm.

169
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,768
No. Yeah. We'll...
We'll talk about that later, Mom.

00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,980
Can I just say, Mr. Andrews,

171
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:27,358
watching you punch Hiram Lodge
in the face was...

172
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,236
incredibly cathartic.

173
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,321
Almost got me landed in jail.

174
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,447

175
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,659
All right, give it a try.

197
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,218

I've no idea what you're talking about.

202
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,826

00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,002

206
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,754

207
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,756
Only you can stop it.

208
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,050
So, stop it.

209

214
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,231
He doesn't deserve this.

215
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,359

- No. You.

Please, Daddy.

219
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:43,911
- It's beyond my control.
- I'm begging you, as your only daughter:

220
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,413
Help Archie.

221
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,415
Save him.

222
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,500
Please.

223
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:54,171
It's simply beyond my control.

224
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:03,472
We know Hiram took over the Southside,
'cause he's colluding with the Ghoulies.

225
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,267
But I need to know
what he's up to exactly.

226
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,063
All right, Fangs, you're up. I need
you to find the Ghoulies' new lair.

If you see them, don't engage with them.

This is just a recon mission.
Can't be risking another gang war.

229
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,822
I just need confirmation
that what Hiram's up to

230
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,158
has nothing to do with the Serpents
or Riverdale High.

231
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,452
Will do. You got it.

232
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,413

Feels pretty savage, Jug.

236
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:38,340
Archie, the first thing I learned
at Southside High

237
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,926
was that you need to roll with a crew
to survive.

238
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,137
There'll be Serpents
in juvenile detention.

239

00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,515
That tattoo's gonna get you in,

241
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,977
- but it's also gonna get you protected.
- [FP] Yeah, Jughead's right.

242
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,437
Up to a point.

243
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,482
Serpent ink will help
keep your body safe,

244
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,443
but you still gotta worry
about protecting this, eh?

245
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,069
I speak from experience.

246
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:02,406
Your mind is the first thing
that goes when you're locked up.

247
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,076
But if you can keep your head on
straight, you can get through anything.

248
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,453
You just...

249
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,791

Mom, what are you doing with my diaries?

251
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,807
I was telling Edgar about them,
and he feels,

252
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,309
and I agree, you should burn them.

253
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,478
What are you talking about? Why?

254
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,438
You've been filling these pages

255

and suffering over the years.

00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,734
You need to let that go.

Okay, Dr. Glass says journaling
is a perfectly healthy outlet.

258

Betty, but these diaries are your past.

But Edgar has done nothing but help me.

He's encouraged me to embrace everything
that I was ashamed of,

267
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,932
- and become the best version of myself.
- Mom,

- I can't deal with this right now.
- But...

what your soul is telling you.

274
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,203
Okay, I'm listening to my soul.

275
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,621
And what it's saying is:

276
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:36,000
"Get the hell away from your mother.
She's been body-snatched."

Hundred percent, man.
They must've snatched him on Riot Night.

He looked skinny. Don't think
the Ghoulies feed him enough.

aren't slow-roasting him on a grill.

351

- We'd be going behind enemy lines,

open to attack from all directions,

353
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,671
and risking another gang war.

354
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:55,509
No Serpent left behind.
That includes our spirit animal.

355
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:58,303
Okay. We deploy after dark.
It'll be a stealth mission.

356

- Gonna be quick.
- [Betty] Jug.

Last time you went into
Ghoulie territory,

Guys, no matter what happens in court...

536
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:11,291
this... is the best last day of summer
a guy could ask for.

537
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:14,711
Archie.

538
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,841
What if you make a break for it?

539
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:26,306
Past that tree line is a road that
goes through the mountains to Quebec.

540
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:28,308
- Jughead.
- Serpents north of the border

541
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:29,642
will keep you supplied.

542
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,562
You don't deserve this, Arch.

543
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,272
Any of it.

544
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:35,398
And what if I do?

545
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:38,985
- Why would you say that?
- Because I'm guilty.

546
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,239
I didn't kill Cassidy.

547
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,201
But I left him alone with Andre.

548
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:49,120
If I hadn't walked away that night,
he might still be alive.

549
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,331
And not just Cassidy, all of it.

550
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:52,874
All of last year.

551
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,048
I didn't kill anyone.

552
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,052
But I could've.

553
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,186
I have to take responsibility for that.

554
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:20,068
[Betty] Jug, I'm not ready
for summer to be over.

555
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:22,779
I don't think I can handle it.

556
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:26,032
What do you mean? Sure you can.

557
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:30,370
Jug, this summer, I haven't stopped,

558
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:33,665
or slept a wink, working
on Archie's case.

559
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,918
I've barely looked up since May, and...

560
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:42,632
My mom and Polly think
that I've been... hiding,

561
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:45,468
or avoiding, and they're right.

562
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:51,349
Maybe I should stop taking Adderall,
start seeing a therapist for real.

563
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,811
Either way, come Tuesday,
it'll all be over,

564
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:57,689
and I'll have to face everything.

565
00:30:57,772 --> 00:31:01,943
Everything that has happened,
everything that will happen.

566
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:06,239
All these things
that I don't have control over,

567
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,950
they just terrify me.

568
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:10,952
Betty.

569
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:13,162
We're gonna get through it.

570
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:18,877
From now on, we're partners.

571
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:22,338
In Serpents, in life...

572
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,883
All of it. Okay?

573
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:07,342
Ronnie.

574
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:12,639
Whatever you're about to say, Archie,
please, don't make me cry.

575
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:18,061
If I do go away,
I don't want you visiting me

576
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,563
in that horrible place, okay?

577
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:24,651
Oh. Rest assured,
if the unthinkable happens,

578
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:28,196
I will be taking the bus every week,
with all the other prison widows,

579
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,907
and bringing you Magnolia cupcakes
from New York.

580
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,201
As well as working on your appeal.
I promise.

581
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,577
That's what I don't want,

582
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:37,246
you spending the rest
of high school waiting for me.

583
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,083
No. You are not breaking up
with me tonight, Archie.

584
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,292
- Ronnie, I...
- Archie.

585
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:45,296
I am not letting my dad take away
the one thing that I love.

586
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,591
It's not happening.

587
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,101
You know, it's weird, Ronnie.

588
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:03,940
The thing that keeps me up most nights
isn't that I might get shivved.

589
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:10,530
It's that I won't
graduate with you guys.

590
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:15,994
It's stupid, right?

591
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,916
I don't think that's stupid at all.

592
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,639
Are you ready, Archie?

593
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,267
Hey, come here.

594
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,061
Be a good boy, okay?

595
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:44,439
Good boy.

596
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,286
[knocking on door]

597
00:33:58,953 --> 00:33:59,787
Hey.

598
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:06,794
- Mr. Jones, is Jughead home?
- I'll get the bikes warm. Hurry up.

599
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,255
Look, Dilton,
now's not really a good time, okay?

600
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:11,591
Ben and I... We thought
it was just a game.

601
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:15,344
A stupid role-playing game, but
it's not. It's so much more.

602
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,389
He's real.

603
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,307
Who?

604
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:21,768
Who is?

605
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,395
Look, I gotta get to Archie's trial.

606
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:26,856
The Gargoyle King.

607
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:33,988
Look, I can't talk right now.

608
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,908
Wanna wait here for a little bit?

609
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,701
Try and get some rest? Yeah? Okay?

610
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:41,788
We can talk about this when I get back.

611
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:42,872
- All right?
- Yeah.

612
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:51,923
[bailiff] All rise.

613
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:01,474
Has the jury reached a verdict?

614
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:05,812
Your Honor, we haven't.

615
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:08,523
- What does that mean?
- [man] We're deadlocked, six-to-six.

616
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:10,817
And it's not gonna change.

617
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:14,987
So be it.

618
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,572
The jury is dismissed.

619
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,658
Thank you for your service.

620
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,287
So, what happens now?

621
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:25,907
- Judge will declare a mistrial.
- We have to go through this again?

622
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:26,833
Shh.

623
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:28,835
[clears throat] Your Honor.

624
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,087
In lieu of another trial,

625
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:34,173
the State is prepared
to offer a deal for a lesser sentence.

626
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:38,261
Instead of prison, time served,
plus two years in juvenile detention,

627
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:42,682
if Mr. Andrews will plead guilty
to the crime of manslaughter.

628
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:44,225
- Your Honor...
- I'll take the deal.

629
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,601
- No, Archie.
- Archie.

630
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,186
- We have to discuss this.
- Mom.

631
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:50,231
I can't put you
and everyone else through this again.

632
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,359
Your Honor, I accept the deal.

633
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,653
Son, just so I have it straight,

634
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:57,864
though it's legally within your rights,

635
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:00,366
you're ignoring the advice
of your counsel,

637
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,327
Yes, Your Honor. I'm guilty.

638
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:10,501
Mr. Andrews,
the court accepts your plea of guilty.

639
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:13,254
You'll be taken directly
from the courthouse

640
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:16,090
to the Leopold and Loeb
Juvenile Detention Center,

641
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:19,844
where you will serve out your sentence,
beginning immediately.

642
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,387
Court is adjourned.

He threatened you, so, you punished him.
