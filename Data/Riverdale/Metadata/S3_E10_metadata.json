His relationship with Veronica is also on thin ice as he is haunted by the aftermath of the bear attack and becomes a shell of his former self, a \"stranger\" to his friends. After everything, Veronica's fling with Reggie may ultimately end up being more than either of them anticipated. Betty pays her father a visit when Alice takes her plans to convince Betty to join The Farm a step too far, but Betty soon gets caught up in Hal's mind games. Jughead and FP use an undercover Fangs to get to The Gargoyle King and, after unmasking him, plan to finally put an end to Hiram and Claudius' reign of terror... until an unexpected gunshot sets everything off course and may put them right back where they started.\u2014snowflakeaudrey"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "8451446", "rating": 7.3, "votes": 1301, "number_of_episodes": 137}
