Of course. I'm just a flightless bird
hanging helplessly over a volcano.

174
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,954
[laughs] Why wouldn't I be good?

175
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:17,914
Don't worry.

176
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:21,209
Dante'll pull you back to safety
if our plan doesn't work.

177
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,544
-Yeah, I got ya, dude! Oops!
-[Dudley screams]

178
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:24,587
[laughs]

179
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,214
No harm, no foul!

180
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:29,675
Or harm to fowl. Get it?
Because you're a bird!

181
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,928
[laughs] Yeah, never mind.

182
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,095
Places, everyone.

183
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,515
Let's get this hero show on the road.

184
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:37,934
Knight takes queen.

185
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,852
And robot. Huzzah!

186
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,896
Ida! We need your help!

187
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:45,775
Dudley was visiting Mrs. Sanchez,
and he fell into the volcano!

188
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,361
And it's gonna erupt any minute!

189
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:53,115
Ah. Help! I'm a dodo in distress.

190
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,617
-[lava burbling]
-[whimpers]

191
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:59,288
But seriously, somebody help!
It's getting really hot over here!

192
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,457
[action music playing]

193
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,543
[panting, grunts]

194
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,547
Thank you, your knightness.

195
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,840
I was about to be a deep-fried dodo.

196
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,676
Now that was heroic.

197
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,011
-You're darn tootin'!
-For sure!

198
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,514
Huh. I guess it was pretty heroic.

199
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:19,600
Can you sign this, pwease?

200
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,060
[giggles]

201
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:24,230
[clears throat] Hear ye, hear ye.
I have an announcement!

202
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,399
I, Ida of the First Floor,

203
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:30,528
have decided to compete in the
Round Table Tournament of Heroes!

204
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:31,779
-Hooray!
-Sweet!

205
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:32,780
Go, girl!

206
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:35,783
I must gather my things,
then depart for the competition!

207
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,369
[Ridley] You both did great.

208
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:41,038
Ida actually believed you were in trouble.

209
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:44,083
Yeah, we were purdy good.

210
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,419
Now, uh, about our payment…

211
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,379
Oh, right. Here you go.

212
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:51,048
[chomps] Yee-haw!

213
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,341
We're rich!

214
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,177
Anytime you need us
to fake like we need savin'…

215
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,263
[chuckles] …just give us a holler.

216
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,015
[melancholy music playing]

217
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:02,351
Ida? Oh no!
I think she might've overheard us.

218
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,771
Well, that ain't good.
She prolly don't feel like a hero no more.

219
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,649
But… [clears throat]
…we're still gonna be keepin' this penny!

220
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,402
Ida, wait! Let me explain.

221
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:15,323
It's all right, Ridley.
What you all did for me tonight was noble.

222
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:18,701
But I know it was not real.
I'm no hero, after all.

223
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,120
But you are! We all know that.

224
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,122
We just wanted you to believe it too.

225
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:26,292
Oopsies. Guess we forgot
to return this. [chuckles, gasps]

226
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,794
Oh no! My ropes!

227
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:32,757
Look out below! Oh!

228
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,134
[Dudley] We're about to be
whale tail pancakes!

229
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,469
Run for your lives!

230
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,679
[all screaming]

231
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,056
My picture!

232
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,557
Ouchie.

233
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,975
Oh no! Pedro!

234
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,936
You don't need to fake any more disasters
for me, Ridley.

235
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:50,316
Uh, that's not a fake disaster! It's real!
We need to save Pedro!

236
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,902
[gasps] Hang on, wee penguin!

237
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,278
[grunting]

238
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,613
Catch, Lady Jones!

239
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:56,530
Gotcha!

240
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:57,531
[grunts]

241
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,575
[epic music playing]

242
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,495
[Ida grunts]

243
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,831
Whoa!

244
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:07,458
[Dudley] She did it!

245
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,584
[Dante] Go, Ida!

246
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,421
You saved me! My hero!

247
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,007
That was incredible!

248
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,551
Do you really think I'm a hero?

249
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,595
Even though the other times weren't real?

250
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,222
Of course we do!

251
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:24,016
Sure, the situations
may not have been real,

252
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,018
but your actions were.

253
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:31,524
Yeah! You never think twice about riding
into danger to save someone.

254
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:32,441
Exactly.

255
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,777
It doesn't matter if your armor is rusty.

256
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,197
What makes a true hero
is what's beneath the armor.

257
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,573
Your heart.

258
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:42,493
And you, Ida, have the heart of a hero.

259
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:43,953
Thank you, Ridley.

260
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,788
Thank you, everyone.

261
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:49,583
For helping me remember
what it really means to be a hero.

262
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,962
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a tournament to enter!

263
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,255
-Yes!
-[Dante] Crush it!

264
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:55,172
[Dudley] Be safe!

265
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:59,301
Just remember, trophy or no trophy,
you're still a hero to us.

266
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:05,975
Wow, so the trophy is an actual table.
Didn't see that coming.

267
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:09,103
It's the coolest twophy I ever saw!

268
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:10,688
Thank you, wee Pedro.

269
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:13,065
You may come over anytime
and help me polish it.

270
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:16,694
Three cheers for our friend, Ida.
A true hero.

271
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:19,363
[all] Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah!

272
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,240
Hey, hero! Catch me!

273
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,119
[all chanting] Ida! Ida! Ida!

274
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,458
-[whimsical music playing]
-[Ridley] Dudley's inferno.

275
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,587
[panting, whimpering]

276
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:38,090
-Hiya, Dudley!
-Greetings, our feathery friend.

277
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:41,635
Pierce! Shh! Use your inside squawk

278
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:45,181
so Lonny doesn't catch me
getting cozy in here. Huh? [laughs]

279
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:48,851
Buddies and birdseed,
all a lonely dodo needs.

280
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,770
Wanna watch the big show with me?

281
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,188
-[gulps]
-A big show?

282
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,522
What big show?

283
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,232
-[rumbling]
-Whoa!

284
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,234
That big show!

285
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:00,404
Dante's volcano! It's working again!

286
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:01,655
Woo-hoo!

287
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:04,408
The volcano's fixed and back in business.

288
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:08,537
Turned out there were
some dinosaur-sized socks jammed inside.

289
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,540
-Rids, will you lower the lift back down?
-On it!

290
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,125
Bravo, Joneses!

291
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,836
Everything's back to normal. [gasps]

292
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,714
Make that almost back to normal.

293
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:23,219
I have no idea how this dodo
keeps getting misplaced every night.

294
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,428
[Lonny laughs]

295
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,348
There ya go, little fella.
Back where you belong.

296
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:30,267
Lonny to Mr. Peabody. Hello?

297
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,269
If Lonny weren't around,

298
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,730
I wouldn't be stuck
in this lonely exhibit.

299
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,816
I'd have the keys to my freedom.

300
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,275
[gasps] Keys!

301
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,861
-Mr. P? You there?
-[beeps]

302
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,697
Hey! You're not my radio.

303
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,157
You're my ticket scanner!

304
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:48,619
Lonny to Mr. Peabody.
The Joneses fixed the volcano!

305
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,704
-Lonny!
-[yelps] Wow. That was fast.

306
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:53,624
Hurry up and lock the front doors
so I can go home.

307
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,001
[grunts]

308
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,295
Um, I'll walk you out.

309
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,382
Hmm. Uh…

310
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:05,636
Well, looking, looking… So many pockets!

311
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,263
Everything okay, Lonny?

312
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,722
Yeah, it's just--

313
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,475
I can't lock up because I've lost my keys

314
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,185
for the hundredth time!

315
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,521
Lonny, how can I make money off of--

316
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:18,357
I mean… [clears throat]
…safeguard this museum

317
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,276
if you can't even lock the front door?

318
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,653
Everyone makes mistakes, Mr. Peabody.

319
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:25,656
That's why I'm giving Lonny here
one last chance.

320
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,491
Find your keys before I get back,

321
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:30,536
or I'll have your badge
and your ticket scanner!

322
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:33,539
Because you'll be fired!

323
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:35,916
Fired?

324
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,669
This museum is the one place
I feel like I belong.

325
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,671
I know the feeling, Lonny.

326
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:44,925
My keys could be anywhere,
which means I have to search everywhere.

327
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:49,513
Ugh! I wish I was as good at
looking for things as I am at losin' 'em.

328
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:51,557
Bad news, everyone.

329
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,225
[Dudley] Great news, everyone!

330
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,562
-We have to find Lonny's keys!
-I took Lonny's keys!

331
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,105
[splutters] Wait. You have them?

332
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:01,275
Yep! Lonny's always putting me back
in my exhibit.

333
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:04,403
My lonesome, little exhibit.

334
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,572
But I'm a social bird, you know?

335
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:09,617
So how does taking Lonny's keys
change that?

336
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,994
Because if Lonny gets fired,

337
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,538
then the museum won't have
a security guard anymore.

338
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,165
I'm a genius!

339
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,083
But Lonny's part of the museum.

340
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:21,211
Even if she's not the best security guard
in the world.

341
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:24,506
She never even noticed
the banana stash I keep in her office.

342
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,218
We need to get Lonny's keys back to her
so she doesn't get fired.

343
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,970
It's the right thing to do.

344
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,139
Where'd you stash them, Dud-man?

345
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,141
[sighs] Follow me.

346
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,435
I hid them under my nest.

347
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,481
-Um, are you sure?
-The keys, they're gone!

348
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:43,359
Yay! [chuckles] I mean, boo!

349
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,945
It's up to us to find them, and fast.

350
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,404
Eyes, are you in?

351
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,322
I'm in!

352
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:49,448
-Totally in!
-Ten-four!

353
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:50,658
But just think.

354
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,744
Without Lonny,
you could leave your tiny dodo exhibit

355
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:56,538
and take flying lessons with the eagles
whenever you wanted.

356
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,623
Only you do that.

357
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:59,375
Okay, fine. I'll help.

358
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,210
But I won't try that hard.

359
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:04,213
Peaches, can you go to the security room
and check the monitors?

360
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,256
Maybe we can figure out
where the keys are.

361
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,549
Mission accepted!

362
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,759
[chittering]

363
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,638
-[Ma] Yee-haw!
-[Pa] Whoo-wee!

364
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:13,889
What a haul!

365
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,308
-We're rich!
-[Pa laughs]

366
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,144
Ridley, I've got eyes on Lonny's keys!

367
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,564
Round up the posse
for an old-fashioned wagon chase!

368
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,482
Ma! Pa!

369
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,025
-[Ismat] Stop!
-[Dante] Wait up!

370
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:28,028
Looks like
we got some bandits on our tail.

371
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,698
-[exclaims] Head for that there cave!
-[Dante] Got 'em!

372
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,658
[Dante grunts] Wipeout!

373
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,868
-[beep]
-Peaches, we've hit a dead end.

374
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,829
The vent exits around the corner!

375
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,497
[Fred] Cut 'em off at the pass!

376
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,124
[Pa] Yee-haw!

377
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,668
-Hold your horses!
-Whoa!

378
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,294
Ma? Pa?

379
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,755
I'm afraid those keys belong to Lonny.

380
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,717
-Land's sake!
-We had no idea!

381
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,635
[Ma] Lonny's good people.

382
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,805
She keeps kids from trying
to take us home in their pockets.

383
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,433
Really? That's awful nice of her.

384
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:01,395
A lot nicer than always being carried back
to the dodo exhibit.

385
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:02,855
[Pa] Here ya go.

386
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:04,481
What's left of 'em, that is.

387
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:05,566
Left of them?

388
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:11,030
According to this list Ma and Pa gave us,
they traded keys with two exhibits.

389
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,907
-I think.
-Who's first on that little list?

390
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,827
Whoa! Watch the hair horns.

391
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,204
The Lemurson kids.

392
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,248
Hey, kids, we need that key!

393
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:22,416
[laughter]

394
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:23,625
-Up here!
-Nope!

395
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,210
Finders lemurs!

396
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:29,798
You heard the kid. Finders lemurs.
Well, we tried. Let's pack it in, folks.

397
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,717
We just need to play with them.

398
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,428
Lemursons! Go long. Really long!

399
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,181
[grunts]

400
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:40,350
-Going super long!
-Epic moves!

401
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,771
Yes! One key down, one more to go.

402
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:47,399
Oh, Pierce, you old softie!

403
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,819
Thank you for the beautiful necklace.

404
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:54,198
Well, I do know how much
you love shiny things.

405
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,908
Happy exhibit-versary.

406
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,951
-Um, excuse me--
-Ridley!

407
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,621
Did you see
what this bag of feathers got me?

408
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,790
Oh, best roommate ever!

409
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,583
That's why I'm here.

410
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,710
The key belongs to Lonny.

411
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:11,006
We need to give it back to her,
or she'll get sent out to pasture.

412
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,925
Though it is a good look.

413
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,593
Very fashion-forward, Flo.

414
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,178
Hon, don't I know it!

415
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:20,933
But I'm happy to part with the key
if it means helping Lonny keep her job.

416
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:23,102
I wholeheartedly agree.

417
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:27,815
She always wipes chocolatey
kid fingerprints off our exhibit.

418
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:30,025
Huh. I didn't know she did that.

419
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,694
Maybe Lonny isn't so bad after all.

420
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,447
Phew! And now we have all the keys.

421
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:38,367
Keys? Here, key-key-keys!

422
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,244
-Everyone hide!
-[all gasp]

423

424
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:48,043
Lonny! Great news!
We-- Uh, I found your keys!

425
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,628
What? I can't believe it!

426
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:53,298
Yay! Back door, side door, trap door…

427
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,468
Did I say "yay"? Aw, I meant "boo."

428
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,594
What is it?

429
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:01,390
The key to the front door isn't here.
It must still be missing.

430
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:04,560
And it's the most important key by far.

431
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:08,063
Oh, how did you end up in here again?

432
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,942
Ugh, if I don't find that last key
before Mr. Peabody gets back,

433
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:14,444
I'll be like the east wing of the museum.

434
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,445
History.

435
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,073
Don't worry. I'll keep looking.

436
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:22,911
Thanks, Ridley, but let's face it,
this might be my last night here.

[Ridley] Great job!
Wait, what's the bad news?

463
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,294
I went back into security cam footage.

464
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:57,798
Turns out, Lonny accidentally
dropped a key into Dante's volcano!

getting stuff out can be gnarly.

all Lonny's keys without you, Dudley.

518
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,052
This stamp's for both of us.

519
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:10,972
But I gotta ask.
What made you decide to help Lonny?

520
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:14,142
As the last of my kind,
I might've mentioned it before,

521
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:18,522
I know how lonely it can be
until you find a place where you belong.

522
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:20,899
And Lonny belongs with us here
in the museum.

523
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,275
-[door opens]
-[all gasp]

524
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,777
[all panting]

525
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,028
[whimpers]

526
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:28,740
I will never know
how this dodo gets around.

527
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:31,743
[chuckles] He is really one of a kind.

528
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,370
You both are.

529
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:36,206
I think I found a new best friend.

530
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:37,207
[sighs]

531
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,167
We might both be one of a kind,

532
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:42,212
but we're definitely birds of a feather.

533
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:43,505
[giggles]

534
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,343
[closing theme music playing]

535
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,388
[music ends]
