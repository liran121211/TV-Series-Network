00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,537
"Let them eat cake!"

175
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,498
Uh-oh. This is not good.

176
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,250
See? It totally works!

177
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:43,045
Oh. Well, if I had a dodo family,
we'd also have a saying.

178
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,590
"When baby lemurs eat a lot of sugar,

179
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,049
run for your lives!"

180
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,009
[lemurs exclaiming]

181
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:50,678
Watch and learn, princess.

182
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:54,557
A good stampede wears out
even the biggest, strongest bisons

183
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,058
like me. [pants]

184
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,936
These little lemurs
will be snoozin' in no time.

185
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,938
[lemurs exclaiming]

186
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:05,276
I've never… [panting] …stampeded
this long in my life.

187
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,153
[all sigh]

188
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,823
Stampede! Stampede! Stampede!

189
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,867
[Dudley] Can we admit defeat now?

190
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,870
I could go to the hall of flags
and get a white one to wave.

191
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,331
No, I can do this.

192
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:21,501
Ridley, I think
it's time to call your mom.

193
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:26,255
But I wanted to show her I could handle
a whole night in the museum by myself.

194
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,632
Without her help.

195
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:30,510
Asking for help isn't a sign of weakness.

196
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,595
It's the sign of a good leader.

197
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,389
Yeah! Even dinosaurs need help sometimes.

198
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,725
You always help everyone, Ridley.

199
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:41,312
Which is why you're going to be
a great protector of the museum.

200
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:43,731
But you're allowed to ask for help too.

201
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,734
You're right. I do need help.

202
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,152
Time to call Mama.

203
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,363
-Ridley!
-[both gasp]

204
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:53,407
[Peaches] Houston,
we have a gigantic mess!

205
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:54,575
I'm sorry, Mama.

206
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:58,329
I thought I could handle babysitting
the lemurs while you were gone.

207
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:01,415
[sighs] Don't worry, sweetheart.
We can fix this.

208
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:04,710
First things first,
we need to track the lemurs down.

209
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,004
And I know you can handle that.

210
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:11,342
Yeah! Okay. Gather up, team.
We have some little lemurs to find.

211
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,261
[lemur giggles]

212
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:14,679
You got this, Dudster?

213
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,389
Oh yeah, I do.

214
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:19,058
Here comes the tickle monster!

215
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:21,602
[Ismat] Time to wrap it up, little lemur.

216
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,856
Woo-hoo! Now that's how you babysit!

217
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:30,570
All right, Mama, we got 'em all!
Now how do we put them to sleep?

218
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,489
Remember how I used to put you to sleep
when you were little?

219
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,951
Uh-huh.
You used to sing me the Museum Lullaby.

220
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:40,788
Wait, that's it?
We need to sing the lemurs to sleep?

221
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:44,542
But I'm not sure
I remember the words to the song.

222
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,835
But we do.

223
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,379
Wait, you guys know the lullaby?

224
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:51,007
Ha ha. I wasn't the only one
who'd sing you to sleep.

225
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,427
We all used to sing
to cutity-cute baby Ridley.

226
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,470

Thanks, everyone.
You're always there to help me.

245
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,831
Even when I don't admit I need it.

246
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,334
Sorry I made such a mess of everything,
Mama.

247
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:11,712
You did a much better job than I did
my first time babysitting.

248
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,548
But if you were having trouble,
why didn't you call sooner?

249
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:17,343
I didn't wanna make you miss your reunion.

250
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:18,928
You were so excited.

251
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,347
Nothing in the world is more important

252
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,849
than helping
my favorite little adventurer.

253
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:27,353
Thanks. But to be honest,
I also wanted to prove

254
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:30,439
that I could take care of the museum
all by myself.

255
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,400
I don't think I'm ready yet.

256
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:35,027
I need a lot more help before I get there.

257
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:36,987
Can I see your passport?

258
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:43,786
[mystical twinkling]

259
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,830
[Ridley] A stamp? What's that for?

260
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,289
For asking for help.

261
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:51,836
It's one of the most important lessons
a protector of the museum can learn.

262
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,295
Thanks, Mama.

263
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,922
[romantic music playing]

264
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,173
[sighing] Oh!

265
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:59,593
What a wonderful evening.
The lights, the glamour…

266
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,387
And how about that food?

267
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:05,141
I've never had
a French bark-guette before! Yum!

268
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:08,644
Oh! They look so peaceful
when they're asleep.

269
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,521
We can't thank Ridley enough

270
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:13,399
for helping us have
such a cracking anniversary.

271
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:16,569
[chuckles] You'll have to thank
your babysitters tomorrow.

272
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,946
Tonight, I think they need their rest.

You guys ready?

00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,753
-Born ready!
-I think so!

278
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,213
Me too!

279
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:39,884
Okay, then.
Operation "Sanchez Smile" is a go!

280
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,635
Cue flossers!

00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,346
[yelping, grunts]

282
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,806
Now cue brushers!

283
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:52,021
[chuckles] Okay, I never thought
I'd have to help a whale floss and brush.

284
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,482
That's museum protector training for ya.

285
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,735
You look like a million barnacles,
Mrs. Sanchez!

286
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:02,698
Thank you for the krill-free smile, dears!

287
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,869
So what's the next stamp
you're aimin' for, sunshine?

288
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:07,828
-[whirring]
-[gasps]

289
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,038
Hold that thought.

290
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,874
I'd know the sound
of grandma's forklift anywhere.

291
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,210
And grandma's forklift means…

292
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,836
[all] New exhibit!

293
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:17,838
Hey there, team.

294
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,007
Here to take a peek
at our newest addition?

295
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,259
Ooh! What is it? What is it?

296
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,637
[dramatic music playing]

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,889
-[Ismat] OMEgypt!
-[Peaches] Wow!

298
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,058
But seriously, what is it?

299
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,976
It's a Sphinx!

300
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:35,189
An ancient, powerful statue
that holds a very valuable secret.

301
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:37,608
And an even more valuable treasure.

302
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,276
-You see--
-[Mr. Peabody] Dr. Jones!

303
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,987
-Whoa! It's Mr. P!
-Scatter, dudes!

304
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,906
[tense music playing]

305
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:47,952
Uh, Mr. Peabody,
what are you still doing here?

306
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:51,956
I had to come see our newest exhibit,
The Sphinx's Treasure.

307
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:55,709
People will be lining up around the block
to see its… its…

308
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,170
[clears throat]
Wait, uh, where's the treasure?

309
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:02,216
The Sphinx guards the treasure
inside her vault, Mr. Peabody.

310
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,717
That's kinda her whole sitch.

311
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,637
Then let's open this up
and see what we bought.

312
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,475
Well, the thing is,
no one's been able to open it. Ever.

313
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,936
But the mystery's half the fun!

314
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:18,983
The fun is having the treasure on display,
so people can pay to see it.

315
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,569
Either you get that vault open by morning,

316
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,113
or I am returning the Sphinx!

317
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,199
He wants to send the Sphinx away?

318
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:31,203
But she gives the Egyptian wing
such a glamorous touch.

319
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:35,040
I'll handle Mr. Peabody.
Think you can tackle getting the treasure?

320
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,501
You bet. The Eyes of the Museum are on it!

321
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:38,586
"Eyes" on three!

322
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,462
One, two…

323
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,631
[straining, grunting]

324
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,966
It was worth a try.

325
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,427
Maybe we can just ask her
to open the door?

326
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:50,097
I don't know.
Sphinxes are usually very tight-lipped.

327
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,099
This one might not even come to life.

328
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:54,310
Hello? Hello!

329
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,186
-Boo!
-[all scream]

330
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,022
Ah, that was so worth the wait!

331
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:01,191
You should've seen your faces!
You were all like, "Blahaha!"

332
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,735
[screams] Not again.

333
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:06,864
Oops! Sorry, cutie-bird-tootie.
Just havin' a little fun.

334
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,616
Good one, stone lady!

335
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:13,787
This "stone lady" goes by Thoebe
because that's my name!

336
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:17,499
Welcome to the museum, Thoebe.
Come on. We'll show you around.

337
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:21,962
So over there is Ida the Knight.
She's super brave and friendly.

338
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:25,215
That's the music exhibit,
and this is my tree house!

339
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:28,302
-I think you're gonna love it here.
-If I get to stay.

340
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:31,805
I heard that kinda rude guy talking.
He wants to have me sent away, again.

341
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,515
What do you mean, "again"?

342
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,477
I've been in museums all over the world.

343

Mr. P's coming! Hide!

512
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:56,625
[Dudley] See you later!

513
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:57,834
[coins clanking]

514
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,878
If the vault isn't open by now,

515
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:03,673
this Sphinx has a one-way ticket
back across the pond!

516
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:07,719
-Looks like no shipping necessary.
-Huh?

517
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,222
-[chuckles]
-You opened the treasure?

518
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:12,307
-I want to see it now.
-Oh, wait!

519
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:15,727
So much g… g… g… gold.

520
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,896
It's beautiful!

521
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,689
Well done, Joneseses.

522
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:23,235
I think I'll keep this exhibit
for a long time.

523
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:24,403
I agree.

524
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:27,030
So, let's talk marketing.

525
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:31,326
Did you hear that, Thoebe?
You're here to stay!

526
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,244
Yay!

527
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:33,245
-Bisonic!
-Stellar!

528
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:35,288
You all are the best!

529
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:40,210
The gold is great, but the real treasure's
having friends like you.

530
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,462
[Dante chuckles] Bring it in, team.

531
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,881
-Love you, dudes!
-[Fred] We love you, Thoebe.

532
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,343
[closing theme music playing]

533
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,388
