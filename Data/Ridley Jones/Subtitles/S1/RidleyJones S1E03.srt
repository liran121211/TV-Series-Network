did not cause the leak!

Or maybe telling a bedtime story
to your favorite extinct bird

I didn't complain when you forced us
to make royal friendship bracelets

167

or when you made us style
each other's hair

168

169

Just tell us what's really wrong
so we can finally go to sleep!

171
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:16,477
Yeah, it's obvious something
is bothering you, but you can tell us.

172

She's right. We do.

174

00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,662
[roars]

345
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:18,000
Life in the museum as we know it
is going to change forever!

346
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,960
I am not gonna let that happen.

347
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:24,214
As protector of this museum,
I'll keep our home free. I promise.

348
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,424
But how?

349
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,426
I don't know yet.

350
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:31,263
Peaches, see what you can find out
about Lonny's security system.

351
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,181
Copy that.

352
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,891
I'm your eyes in the sky.

353
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:39,146
Let's see what Lonny's been up to.

354
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:42,107
-[typing]
-Weird. I don't see any extra security.

355
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,860
Then again, Lonny's never been
very good at her job.

356
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,655
Hmm. I'm forgetting something.

357
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,698
Oh yeah! I forgot to turn it on.

358
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,992
-[laughs, makes beeping sounds]
-[tablet beeps]

359
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,494
[lasers whirring, beeping]

360
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:55,245
-[gasps] Lasers?
-Whoa!

361
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,747
-Whoa!
-Watch out!

362
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,207
Uh, Peaches?

363
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,792
We have a problem.

364
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,670
I think Lonny's better at her job
than we thought!

365
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:06,423
Yep. I can't believe it,
but Lonny's system looks foolproof!

366
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,342
Hang tight until I can turn it off.

367
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,636
[gasps] It works!
I can't believe it works!

368
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:11,929
-[alarm blaring]
-[screams]

369
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,389
Why'd you have to work?

370
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,641
-Alarm off! Off!
-[alarm continues]

371
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:18,727
Aw, come on! Just this once,
let me get something right!

372
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,438
Peaches? Lonny's headed your way.

373
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:25,234
[whimpers] But I still haven't figured out
this darn security system!

374
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,152
[Ridley] She's almost to the room!

375
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,904
-Get out now!
-[door rattling]

376
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,322
Why is this door locked?

377
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,532
Is someone in there?

378
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:35,744
Alarm, turn off!
Pretty please with pickles on top?

379
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:36,870
Oh boy.

380
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:39,540
I sure am up pretty high right now.
[gulps]

381
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:40,833
Come on!

382
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,168
-Oh, I give up! [gasps]
-[computer chimes]

383
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,254
Security system deactivated?

384
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:46,880
The lasers!

385
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,007
-They're off!
-Yes!

386
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:48,924
I'm saved!

387
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,386
Peaches, the lasers are off,
and everything is back to normal!

388
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:54,805
Why did it have to be heights?

389
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,432
Ooh! I can't look anymore!

390
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,975
-It's too scary!
-[crackling]

391
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,810
[alarm sounding]

392
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:03,313
I don't think
this is what "back to normal" looks like.

393
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,690
[exclaims]

394
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:07,026
[Ridley] Peaches, we have a new problem.

395
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:10,946
Or, make that lots of new problems.
What happened?

396
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:15,659
[splutters] I was hidin' in the ceiling
and had a little banana blunder.

397
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,995
-This is nothin' I can't take care of!
-[beep]

398
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,164
-You sure? You sound scared.
-[alarm blaring]

399
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,999
Me? Scared?

400
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:26,045
[nervous chuckle] Of course not!
Remember who you're talkin' to.

401
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:26,962
Oh no!

402
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,007
With the stairs to the tree house out,
Grandma's trapped there.

403
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:34,053
It's up to us to get everyone into their
exhibits before Peabody gets back.

404
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:37,848
With Lonny walking around
and the museum going bananas,

405
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:40,059
how exactly are we supposed to do that?

406
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,935
I guess it'll be an adventure!

407
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:46,106
This way, mummies! You're almost home!

408
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,901
-[Dante] Yeah!
-[Dudley whimpers]

409
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:54,156
That's all well and good for them,
but is the Egyptian wing usually so foggy?

410
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,658
It's really making my hair horns
frizz out.

411
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,161
No, it's more of a dry heat.

412
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:02,122
Peaches, we've got fog
blocking our way out of here.

413
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,416
I got eyes on the fog, but not on you.

414
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,793
Hold, please.

415
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,961
All right, I got eyes back on you.

416
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,631
Everyone take two steps forward.

417
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,342
Now take three steps to the left.

418
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:15,844
Dante, your other left.

419
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:16,762
Oh. [chuckles]

420
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:17,679
Thanks, Peaches.

421
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:21,100
Now take one giant leap for monkeykind!

422
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,309
-Woo-hoo!
-[Dante] Sweet!

423
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:23,602
-Yeah!
-Thank you, Peaches!

424
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:28,315
Hey, butterflies, don't panic.
Your exhibit is just around that corner.

425
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:29,817
-Thanks!
-We're saved!

426
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,611
-Okay, now we need to get back to--
-[lasers beeping]

427
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,530
Uh-oh! More lasers!

428
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,698
-Run!
-[Ismat] Whoa! [grunts]

429
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,658
Ismat!

430
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:38,617
Keep going!

431
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,161
This might be a wrap for me!

432
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,913
[grunting]

433
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,333
Don't worry, Ismat.
We'll find a way to get you out.

434
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:49,211
But who's got the moves
to get through those lasers?

435
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,088
Yeah, not me. Or Ralph.

436
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,382
He's a terrible dancer. Oops!

437
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,341
But I'm not.

438
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:55,884
I got moo-ves!

439
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:59,888
[grunts, imitates dance music]

440
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,185
May I have this dance, princess?

441
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,563
It's "queen." But, yes, thank you, please!

442
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,648
[imitates dance music]

443
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,194
What can I say?

444
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:17,072
These hooves were made for dancin'!

445
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:21,618
You know you're the most
cute-cute-cuteity-cute bison ever, right?

446
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:22,953
[groans]

447
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:25,372
Yes. But I don't wanna be cute.

448
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:27,666
I wanna be a big gruff beast!

449
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:31,837
Peaches, is there any way
to get the museum back under control?

450
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,839
[Peaches] All the sensors are overloadin'!

451
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:37,092
At this point, all I can think to do
is shut off the electricity.

452
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,595
It looks like the power control box is…

453
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,722
[nervously] …way up there. [whimpers]

454
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:44,057
You need to blast off to reach it.

455
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,976
Oh no! The door is closing!

456
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:49,229
And Peabody's back!
I better rocket back to my exhibit.

457
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,522
Peaches over and out!

458
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:51,899
[Ridley] Hurry!

459
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,360
[grunts]

460
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:56,361
Whew!

461
00:19:57,237 --> 00:20:00,782
Well, looks like none of us
are gettin' back to our exhibits.

462
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,576
What else could go wrong?

463
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,912
[all gasp, scream]

464
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:08,248
-[whimpers]
-[Ismat] This is not a good look.

465
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,584
We can't let Mr. Peabody see us like this.

466
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:13,587
Wait! That's the power control box, right?

467
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,089
We can turn off the electricity from here!

468
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,842
-Dude, that is a whole lotta wires.
-[electrical crackling]

469
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:21,511
-[thud]
-[all screaming]

470
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:22,721
[all gasp]

471
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,600
Peaches will know which one to cut.
Right, Peaches?

472
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:28,644
What's wrong?

473
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,813
[splutters] It might not be the best time
to tell you this…

474
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,816
[whimpers] …but I'm scared of heights.

475
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,526
But you're an astronaut.

476
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,612
Who's been strapped to a rocket.

477
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:41,782
That took you hundreds of miles
above the Earth!

478
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:44,701
By choice! How could you do that
if you're scared of heights?

479
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,704
I close my eyes during takeoff?

480
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,290
[yelps] Bad floor buffer, bad!
[buffer whirring]

481
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,417
Lonny! Let me in!

482
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:56,588
Wait. Is that why you sounded scared
when you were up in the ceiling earlier?

483
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,340
Why didn't you just tell us?

484
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:02,427
It's just that I've done a lot of
out-of-this-world things in my time,

485
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:05,847
and I've never let my crew down until now.

486
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,766
I'm sorry, everyone.

487
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:10,644
Maybe I don't have
the right stuff after all.

488
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:13,355
Everyone has fears, Peaches.

489
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,358
I'm scared I'll never find
my magical compass.

490
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,528
I'm terrified of missing
Cairo Fashion Week.

491
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,406
And I'm scared
Ralph's gonna move out one day.

492
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:25,117
I'm scared
I might not be scared of anything.

493
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,619
And I'm scared of everything.

494
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,246
Thanks, everyone.

495
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:33,458
But I still don't think I can move
a single astronaut muscle,

496
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,085
let alone cut the power.

497
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:38,588
Yes, you can.
For once, I'll be your eyes in the sky.

498
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:41,383
Look at me,
and I'll be your mission control.

You know, Mr. P,
I'm more of a daytime security guard.

I think we should leave overnight security

Thank you, sir. Especially since
the floor buffer ate my car keys.

Yes! We did it!
