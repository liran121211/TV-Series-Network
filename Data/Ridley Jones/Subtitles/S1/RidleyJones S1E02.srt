Here. Now that you're
officially in training,

00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:32,133
it's time that you had your very own
Museum Passport.

to fly with the big birds.

Why don't you?

62
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:45,498
Because I'm a flightless bird.
I just flap my wings for effect.

go hang out in the eagle exhibit?

Could I transfer to the eagle exhibit?

and chillest bird I know, by the way,

Ridley, we've got a dodo-sized problem.

I need you to get Dudley out of
the eagle exhibit before anyone sees.

Wait, what? Why?

100
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:23,221
I'll explain later. For now, I'll distract
Mr. Peabody while you handle Dudley.

Everything is perfectly…

be in the eagle exhibit?

He really likes it there.

108
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,197
Well, as protectors of the museum,

109
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,742
we have to make sure everything is true
to the best of our knowledge.

110
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:48,288
Facts matter. Museums teach kids
the truth about the world,

111
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:51,416
so we can't let any exhibits
be empty or incorrect.

112
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:52,709
-Make sense?
-Mm-hmm.

to keep everything straight.

Yes. Mom says that no exhibit
can be empty or wrong.

has to be as true as we can make it.

Those aren't real.

[inhales sharply]
Yeah, right, that doesn't make sense.

With this disguise,
I'll blend in with the penguins.

176
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,126
-Dudley?
-[yelps]

177
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,335
The jig is up.

178
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,171
[strains, grunts]

179
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:46,382
Your exhibit can't be empty, remember?

180
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,176
Oh. Right.

181
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:52,138
As you can see,
this exhibit is rotunda-adjacent,

182
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,474
just steps from the trendy music exhibit,

183
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:57,268
boasts views of the Jones Tree House,

184
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,729
and comes fully furnished. Mmm?

185
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,565
Well, it's gotten pretty crowded
in the lemur exhibit.

186
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:05,860
And I'm tired of sharing a branch
with all our brothers and sisters.

187
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:07,862
You sure it's cool if we move in here?

188
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:12,658
Sure, I'm sure. As long as an exhibit
isn't empty, we're fine.

189
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,952
If you need me,
I'll be in the eagle exhibit.

190
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:17,580
I didn't think it was okay
to switch exhibits.

191
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,749
I didn't either, but you heard the bird.

192
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:22,752
And I've always wanted
to move to the Serengeti.

193
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:26,130
Wait. But if you move in there,
where will those animals go?

194
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:28,758
Huh?

195
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,469
What? Where are you all going? [gasps]

196
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:34,096
[intriguing music playing]

197
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,556
Uh-oh.

198
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,144
Hey, what gives?
The knight took over my bison exhibit!

199
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,355
And now she's the one who looks tough!

200
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,690
Doesn't she always look tough?

201
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:48,027
What do ya think
caused this whole hullabaloo, Ridley?

202
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:52,198
I don't know for sure,
but I have a pretty good guess.

203
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,199
[Dudley laughing]

204
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:55,535
Don't worry.
I'll get to the bottom of this.

205
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,746
You guys get everyone
back to the right exhibit.

206
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,124
[Peaches] Fly home, butterflies! Fly home!

207
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,086
Don't you miss your usual spot, milady?

208
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:06,796
Sorry for the chaos.

209
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,298
I thought I was following the rules… ish.

210
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,551
I wish I could let you move
where you want,

211
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,762
but everyone in the museum
has to stay where they belong.

212
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,138
-Okay?
-Okay.

213
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,139
Great.

214
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:22,103
[sighs] But I feel like over there
with the eagles is where I belong.

215
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:24,522
[sighs] There.

216
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,941
Now I can keep an eye out until morning

217
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:30,236
and make sure everyone stays
where they're supposed to.

218
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,613
[eagles laughing]

219
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,908
[intriguing music playing]

220
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:40,037
Uh-oh. If I go this way,
Ridley'll definitely see me.

221
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,456
Aha.

222
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:48,212
[grunts] Just a little bit further,
and I'll be right above the eagle exhibit.

223
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,006
[laughs] Yippee-ki--

224
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,048

225
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,049
[rattling]

226
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,803
[gasps] Oh no, I fell asleep,
and… [gasps] …it's morning already?

227
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:58,347
-The museum's gonna open any minute!
-[Dudley] Help!

228
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,725
Somebody help, I'm stuck!

229
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,977
Don't worry, Dudley. I'm coming!

230
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,396
[panting]

231
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:08,441
Ridley! Boy, aren't you a sight
for sore bird eyes?

232
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,109
What happened?

233
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:13,487
I was trying to get into the eagle exhibit
without getting caught.

234
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,072
I'm sorry for sneaking off.

235
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:18,409
Dudley, why do you wanna be
with the eagles so badly?

236
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:19,493
[sighs]

237
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,078
I'm one of a kind, y'know?

238
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,956
And it gets lonely
being the last of the dodo birds.

239
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,459
Just once, I wanted to be
a part of a family.

240
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:29,003
-[Fred] Ridley, we're ready to go!
-Hmm? Who said that?

241
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,421
Your family.

242
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,840
We're all here for ya, D-man!

243
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:36,177
We must free you so you can attend
your next flying lesson!

244
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,262
Ridley, let us know when to start pullin'!

245
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,806
[Ridley] Okay, now!

246

Okay? I'm great!

I have the world's bravest friends.

You all risked hoof and claw to save me.

Well, yeah!

Yeah, one trumpet means dinner.
Gotta get home.

why don't we walk you home?

Here's my ride. Thanks though!

I meant walking home.

Yep, walking. Bye!

acting kind of weird right now?

And has anyone else
actually been to her place?

we should check on Ismat?

Nope.

Come on. We're her friends.

317
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,983
Something was clearly bothering her.

318
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,568
We should find out what it is.

319
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,862
[begrudgingly] Okay.

Wow! Looks like the princess
is treated like a princess.

323
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,124
I thought she was a queen.

00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,668
Ugh, same difference.

325
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,379
I think she's good.
So can we get back to playing?

326
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:02,216
Just because she's being totally pampered
doesn't mean something isn't wrong.

Even though it looks so, so right.

"Carried away"? Oh. [chuckles]

00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,272
This? [laughs]

That's not what this is.

336
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:25,239
So, what are you guys doing
in this neck of the museum?

00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,449
-Looking for you.

We're the dads.

00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,972
I'm Aten. This is Kosy.

348
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,391
It's really nice to finally meet you.

349
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,268
Ismat's told us all about you.

350
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:58,522
Nice to meet you too!
She's told us nothing about you.

351
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,525
Well, then,
you all just have to stay for dinner.

352
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,986
We'll get extra place settings
from the basement.

353
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,404
[Ismat] Wait! Dads!

354
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:10,159
Ismat, you weren't trying to hide
that you have two dads, were you?

355
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,827
'Cause that seems awesome to me.

356
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,621
What? No!

357
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,706
Having two dads is the best.

358
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,750
I get to hear twice the dad jokes!

359
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,752
Then why haven't you invited us over?

360
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:23,464
If your part of the exhibit is small
or kinda cramped, that's cool!

361
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,007
I promise to watch the tail.

362
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,676
That's definitely not it.

363
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,470
You'll see what I mean.

364
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,848
[all] Whoa!

365
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,808
[Dudley] Ay, chihuahua!

366
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,645
Okay, definitely not small or cramped.

367
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,813
My tail can have its own wing.

368
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,941
My wings can have their own tail!

369
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,318
That… that doesn't make any sense.

370
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:47,780
But still, this place is ginormous.

371
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,406
You live here?

372
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,576
Yeah, but only this room,
and the next room,

373
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,578
and the 33 rooms after that.

374
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:58,874
But… but that's it. [chuckles nervously]
Just a simple royal life.

375
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,753
Whoa!
Uh, I guess it's time to sit down to eat!

376
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,589
Can you believe this place?

377
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:08,342
It might be bigger and more impressive
than I am.

378
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:11,845
It's out of this world!
And I've been out of this world!

379
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:15,474
Good evening, ladies and gentle-mummies.

380
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:18,602
Before we eat,
we present to you our queen.

381
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:23,899
Queen Ismat Chione Jomana
Edrice Khepri the Great…est.

382
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,693
[trumpet sounds]

383
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:29,113
But you can just call me "Ismat."
It's not really a big deal.

384
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:32,825
Now, let us begin
the first of our nightly "big deals."

385
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,160
The royal mummy pampering!

386
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,663
Uh… [chuckles nervously]

387
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:41,625
Dudes. I've seen a lot of wild stuff
in my 65 million years,

388
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,669
but this is way over the top.

389
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:46,630
Can I get another fan over here?
One for each wing?

390
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:47,589
[sighs]

391
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,217
Talk about five-pyramid treatment.

392
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:54,304
I don't know.
Ismat doesn't look too happy about it.

393
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:57,683
[mouthful] Ooh, I know it looks like
I get treated like a queen…

394
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,601
Well, I mean, I do. I am.

395
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,396
But it's not as fancy as it seems.

396
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:05,858
Oh, good,
'cause, uh, it seems ridiculously fancy.

397
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:09,278
Next you're gonna tell us
there are dancing peacocks.

398
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,196
No! [chuckles]

399
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,074
I actually, um… The thing is…

400
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:17,828
And now for the most important part of
our nightly tradition.

401
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:20,831
"Nightly"? You get treated this way
every night?

402
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:23,834
Presenting the queen's crown!

403
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:27,129
Bowing. Bowing.
Not looking in your eyes. Bowing.

404
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,964
Wait! [splutters] No! Dads!

405
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,175
The thing is… Enough! That's enough!

406
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:32,676
Dinner is over!

407
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,178
-[all gasp]
-Sweetie!

408
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,554
I'm not your sweetie!

409
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:36,638
[all gasp]

410
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:41,477
I mean, I am. I love you, Dads, kiss-kiss,
but right now, I'm the queen!

411
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,145
And by royal decree,

412
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,938
I'm canceling dinner!

413
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:45,981
[all gasp]

414
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:49,610
[melancholy music playing]

415
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,909
[Ridley] Ismat, what's going on?

416
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:59,286
You can tell us. We're your friends.

417
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:03,457
But also your subjects, so please,
no "off with his head"-ing.

418
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,666
I like my head.

419
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,960
She can't really do that.

420
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,087
-Can you?
-I can.

421
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,671
-[gasps]
-But I wouldn't.

422
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,382
[sighs] The truth is,
I never invited you over

423
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:16,011
because I'm kind of embarrassed
of all of this whoop-de-do!

424
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,723
Every night, our dinner has
all of these grand traditions,

425
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,226
and I get pampered
from head-wrap to toe-wrap!

426
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,937
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I like a little pampering.

427
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,816
I'm a queen, after all,
but not every night.

428
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:32,569
I don't think I'd mind it at all!
I could rock a throne and a scepter.

429
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:36,740
I like hanging out with you guys
because you treat me like a normal kid.

430
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,827
Even when my queenly side
comes out in front of you.

431
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,996
Of course!
You'll always just be Ismat to us.

432
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,291
I know. But my dads get carried away.

433
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,378
And they treat me more like a royal
than a daughter.

434
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:52,756
I kinda miss just being a kid. Their kid.

[Peaches] Bringin' these arms in
for a landing.

436
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,593
Thanks, everyone.

437
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,054
You should tell your dads
what you just told us.

438
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,306
I'm sure they'd wanna know.

439
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,307
You're right.

440
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,561
I need to tell them that I don't wanna
wear this crown every night.

441
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,313
Wait, the crown, where did it go?

442
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,065
Crown down! Crown down!

443
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,526
Nothing in here except, uh…

444
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,736
[chewing] …delicious leftovers. [gulps]

445
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,824
Oh no. My dads are gonna be crushed
when they find out I lost the crown!

446
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:21,410
I already hurt them when I yelled at them.

447
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,787
I gotta make this better! What do we do?

448
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:27,082
Don't worry, Ismat. We'll find it.
We just need to keep an eye out.

449
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,544
Or should I say eyes in the sky?

450
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:31,712
[chitters]

451
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:36,842
All right, y'all. Got my peepers on peeps
from every wing in the museum.

452
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,594
I'll find out where that crown is.

453
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:39,553
Wait, is it--

454
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,431
What in NASA is goin' on over there?

455
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,308
False alarm! Give me a sec.

456
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,813
There we go!
Ridley, one of the mummy subjects

457
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,691
must've accidentally cleared the crown
with the dinner dishes!

458
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:54,151
Okay, we'll head that way.

459
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,528
I'll stay in case my dads come back.

460
00:19:56,612 --> 00:20:00,365
Good luck! Make your queen--
I mean, your friend proud!

461
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,283
You got it!

462
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:04,536
Okay, head to the right up ahead,
then to the left!

463
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,746
There it is!

464
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:07,831
Hurry!

465
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:10,083
We got the box now.

466
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:15,339
[Ridley] That's a lot of boxes.

467
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:20,677
So, the crown is now in this giant room,

468
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:23,847
in one of these boxes,
which all look the same?

469
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:26,141
Time to start unboxing. And fast.

470
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,897
Hey, trying to nap here!

471
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,981
Sorry!

472
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,191
Don't see it in--

473
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,859
Whoa!

Dudley, you found it!

480
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:47,913
[muffled] Ha! It wasn't easy.

481
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,916
You know what they say.
Heavy is the head that wears the crown.

483
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,377
Oh, Dudley!

484
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,922
[muffled] No, I'm serious.
This is really heavy. Help!

485
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,343
Ridley, everyone, thank you.

486

I don't know what I would've done
if the crown was lost forever.

487
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:09,351
Dad, Dad, I'm sorry
for hurting your feelings by royal decree.

488
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,603
And for not being honest with you.

489
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:16,275
Well, you were a little "royal,"
so apology accepted.

490
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,860
But what's been goin' on with you, kiddo?

491
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:23,156
Well, it's kinda embarrassing having
you treat me like a queen all the time.

492
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,242
I didn't want my friends to see.

00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:13,517
Thanks for inviting us
for dinner again, Ismat!

516
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,935
Yeah, it's good to be back.

517
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:19,731
I could really use some pampering
right about now. Loyal subjects? Hello?

518
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:20,732
[chuckles] Dudley!

519
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:25,445
My dads and I gave everyone the night off
so we could have a quiet dinner with you.

520
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:28,657
What? But then who'll feed me grapes? Me?

521
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:31,660
Hey, Dante,
you can use your tail to feed me.

522
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,370
No problem, little dude!

523
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:36,957
Okay, a little lower… a little lower…

524
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,083
[gulps, sighs]

525
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,460
A bird could get used to this.

526
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,629
[all laughing]

527
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,343
[closing theme music playing]

528
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,388
[music ends]
