[Ridley] The taming of the tail.

Hey, Grandma!

29
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,869
Oh, Ridley, your vine work
is really coming along.

30
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:20,413
Yeah, I think I'm getting the swing of it.

31
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:21,915
So, what's in the crate?

32
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:23,666
Whoa!

33
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,251
Look at all these vases.

34
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,879
From every corner of the world.

35
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:31,883
Ooh, careful with the swinging, dear.
The pottery is very breakable.

36
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:34,594
Don't worry, Grandma, I'm always care--

37
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:35,678
Whoa!

38
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,972
Well… [chuckles] …almost always.

39
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,682
What's it all for anyway?

40
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,768
Our new world pottery exhibit!

41
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,394
I'm building a space for it,

42
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,855
then I'll load the pieces inside.

43
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:50,360
I could really use an extra pair of hands
to get everything ready. Wanna help?

44
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,612
Really? Me? Yes! I accept!

45
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:54,447
I'll do it! Thank you, Grandma.

46
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:57,408
I'm so happy
I could swing on a vine, and--

47
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,618
But I won't.

48
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:01,412
[chuckles] I know, too many breakables.

-Oops! Can't take this thing anywhere.

50
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:07,043
Except I have to
because it's attached to me.

51
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,212
-Hey, everybody!
-Hiya, sunshine!

52
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,130
Ooh!

53
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:13,967
Are you redecorating the tree house?
I love a good makeover.

54
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,053
Nope! These are
for the new world pottery exhibit

55
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:20,598
that I, Ridley Jones,
am helping Grandma set up.

56
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,935
Wait a stegosecond.
We can help with the pottery too!

57
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:26,062
-I love new exhibits.
-Cool!

58
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:29,065
Let's make it an official
Eyes of the Museum mission!

59
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,235
Come on, team. Eyes on three! One, two…

60
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:35,238
Sorry. Ralph here's pretty excitable.

61
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,948
You know how tails are.

62
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:40,618
I'm not so sure it's a good idea
to have Dante help tonight.

63
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:44,998
This pottery is one-of-a-kind
and very, very, very fragile.

64
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:47,709
It really needs to be handled with care.

65
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,460
And Dante, well…

66
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:50,837
Come here, Ralphie!

67
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,506
[chuckles] Come here! Oops!

68
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,676
Yeah, he does have a knack
for knocking things over.

69
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:00,930
As a protector of the museum,
I need to do what's best for the pottery.

70
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,308
Spoken like a true Jones woman.

71
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:06,936
You know, I think I'll help Grandma
by myself.

72
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,688
This is a Jones family job!

73
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:11,983
We can't leave you alone!
We're the Eyes of the Museum.

74
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:15,069
All for one dudette
and one dudette for all!

75
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,029
Watch out!

76
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:17,864
That tail is bananas!

77
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,366
Whoa! Board wipeout!

78
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,368
Psst! Eyes, huddle up.

79
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,746
I think you-know-who
needs to tame his tail

80
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,998
before he can go near any of the pottery.

81
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:30,585
"You-know-who?" I don't know who.
Is it me? [gasps] It's me, isn't it?

82
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,378
No, it's Dante!

83
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,047
Oh. I should've known that.

84
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,673
But Dante's part of the team.

85
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,676
Yep. Which is why we're gonna help him.

86
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,930
We can show him how to move carefully
around fragile stuff.

87
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,557
Bisonic idea! Let's go tell him.

88
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:48,561
Wait! Saying the training is only for him
might hurt his feelings.

89
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:52,315
True. As the very last dodo,
I know how it feels to be singled out.

90
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,233
[drill whirring]

91
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:56,861
Time to whip this new exhibit space
into shape!

92
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,239
Oh, cool, power tools!

93
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:02,367
Uh, Dante, wait! We can't go in there yet.

94
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:06,204
Not until we have a team training session.

95
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,790
[laughs] A training session?

96
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,375
You pullin' my scales?

97
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,878
What kind of training do we need
to move a couple vases around?

98
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,213
Uh, oops! [chuckles]

99
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:20,009
We need someone who knows
how to handle having a big tail.

100
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:24,013
And I know who has the biggest tail
in the whole museum!

101
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:27,642
Mrs. Sanchez knows all about hanging
around priceless artifacts!

102
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:30,937
She can show us how to not,
you know, knock stuff over.

103
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,730
Indeed I can.

104
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,733
Now, find your flow.

105
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,860
Be one with your tail.

106
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,238
And try an "om"…

107
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:41,698
[all] Ooh.

108
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,409
What if you don't have a tail?

109
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:48,413
Then just go with the flow.

110
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:51,374
I'm in the flow zone.

111
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:52,750
-[drill whirring]
-[screams]

112
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,420
Now I'm in the no-flow zone!

113
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,088
Dante, it's just Grandma's drill!

114
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,840
[Dante screaming]

115
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,883
I'm spinning out!

116
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:05,054
[grunts] I don't think this is the pose
we were going for.

117
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,309
Is all of this really necessary, princess?

118
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,269
It's "queen." And yes.

119
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,980
As a royal and fashionista,

120
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:18,568
I'm the perfect mummy
to teach Dante poses and poise.

121
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:22,363
We need to move around the pottery
with respect. That's poise.

122
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:26,075
And given the choice,
you should always do it in style!

123
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,660
That's poses.

124
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,749
Aw. None of that happens
when I clap in my exhibit.

125
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,584
Balance these scrolls on your head,

126
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,962
and let's try,
"Follow the Ancient Egyptian Leader!"

127
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,756
Chin up. Shoulders back.

128
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,507
And strut. And turn.

129
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,509
And strut. And turn!

130
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,845
Gimme your best mummy-smize!

131
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,096
[grunts] Ah!

132
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,475
I'm getting mummy-wrapped up! [grunts]

133
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,060
[chuckles]

134
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:54,937
I don't think poses
were a step in the right direction.

135
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:59,609
You all know me
as a rough and tough beast…

136
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,945
-The cutest rough and tough beast!
-I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

137
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,449
But I'm also a bit of a twinkle toes.
Or hooves!

138
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:11,621
Being light on my hooves helps me
not break things when I'm stompin' around.

139
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:15,166
How can we be light on our hooves
if we don't have hooves?

140
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:19,253
By doing my patented,
secret bisonic dance moves!

141
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,381
Line up here and follow my groove.

142
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:22,423
[dance music playing]

143
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,467
[singsong] Hoof it to the left,
cha-cha-cha!

144
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,510
Hoof it to the right!

145
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,887
Now spin and roar! Cha-cha-cha!

146
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,305
[all] Roar! Cha-cha-cha!

147
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:34,852
Wait! My tail's
cha-cha-cha-ing the wrong way!

148
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,521
[strains, grunts]

149
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:42,485
Sorry, I guess the bisonic dance class
isn't for beginners.

150
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:45,905
Houston, it's time
for some basic training. Over!

151
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:48,991
Astronauts might be famous

152
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,828
for being shot through the sky
at hundreds of miles an hour,

153
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:56,958
but we also perfected our controlled,
low-gravity walk.

154
00:06:57,041 --> 00:07:01,003
I mean, what could be better
for being around super breakable things?

155
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,171
Not moving at all.

156
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,757
That's what I always do
in dangerous situations.

157
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:05,967
[laughs] Nothing!

158
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,260
[Dante] Woo-hoo!

159
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:08,428
Yeah!

160
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:09,554
Dante, no!

161
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:12,557
[exclaims] Sorry, everyone!
It was my tail!

162
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,891
[Ridley] Oh no!

163
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,018
[crashing, thudding]

164
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:20,815
It's headed for the pottery!
Dante, gimme your board!

165
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,991
-[sighs]
-[Dante] Whoa! This place is a mess!

166
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,159
[Ridley] Oh no.

167
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,911
-I'll clean up over by the pottery.
-[all] No!

168
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,706
Uh, what we mean is, we'll clean it up.

169
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,416
You just, uh, have a seat.

170
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,585
Away from the pottery.

171
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,962
Oh! Um, okay, I guess.

172
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:47,008
I mean, it's kinda far from the action,
but if it's what you want…

173
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:48,593
[clank]

174

I didn't mean to do that. [groans]

519
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:53,455
Thank you, Eyes. I never would've
found everything without your help.

520
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:57,167
Passport, please, Miss Ridley Jones.

521
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,795
You've earned an inventory stamp!

522
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:02,381
Thanks, Mama! That was a close one.

523
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:03,757
Sorry, Ridley.

524
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,344
Even though we were buddied up,
I kept trying to do everything myself.

525
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:08,387
Me too.

526
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:12,349
Turns out, when we actually work together,
we make a good team.

527
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:15,644
Told ya!
The two of you together is a home run.

528
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,646
-Sure thing!
-Of course!

529
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:23,568
Ismat… [chuckles] …you know that
mushy stuff I said in the trash chute?

530
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:26,279
Yeah, it's okay.
I know you didn't mean any of it.

531
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:29,991
Mm, that's the thing, I kinda did.

532
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,327
Really? I meant what I said too.

533
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,454
Being an odd couple has its perks.

534
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:37,416
I still can't believe
you let me touch your crown!

535
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:40,043
Hey, that was a one-time-only event!

536
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,378
Hooves off the bling!

537
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,964
[both laughing]

538
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:44,965
[Fred snorts]

539
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,343
[closing theme music playing]

540
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,388
[music ends]
