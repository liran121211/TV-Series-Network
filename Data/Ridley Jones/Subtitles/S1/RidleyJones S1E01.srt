00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:37,957
I have such a cramp in my tail!

176
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,960
The butterflies love to surf the tail.

177
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:44,005
This place is incredible!

178
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,549
Well, your mama and grandmama

179
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:50,094
have always taken
galactically great care of us.

180
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:54,056
My mom's in trouble.
The Phoenix Ruby is gone.

181
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,268
If she doesn't find it before the morning,
she could lose her job.

182
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,520
I wanna help,
but she doesn't think I'm ready.

183
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:03,941
Sometimes you have to tell people
who you really are on the inside.

184
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,777
I just wish I could do more to--
Wait, what's that?

185
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:07,737
[Ridley gasps]

186
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,072
The necklace! I can help my mom.

187
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,868
Careful! Caribou get real jumpy
when you go into their exhibit.

188
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:16,496
You know what would be really bad?
A stampede!

189
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,206
[screams] Stampede!

190
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:22,335
It's like they read my mind!
See? If I can think it, I can be it!

191
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,545
I am an eagle. I am an eagle!

192
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:25,922
-[Ridley] Whoa!
-[gasps]

193
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,925
Dude, that was cretaceously close.

194
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,343
[caribou] Stampede!

195
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,136
Wait. There's no back wall?

196
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,262
Not at night.

197
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:37,892
-[adventurous music playing]
-Are they going away or getting closer?

198
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,311
-Oh! Oh! Closer!
-[Peaches] Brace for impact.

199
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:42,063
[caribou] Stampede!

200
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,022
[panting]

201
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,525
-Are you sure you're ready?
-[all] Huh?

202
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,443
Oh, helmet. Forgot.

203
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,904
Ridley, are you sure you're ready?

204
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,906
Stampedes are serious business.

205
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,283
We wouldn't want you to go
the way of the dodo bird

206
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,035
because we went extinct! You know?

207
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,620
Uh, I feel your pain, dude.

208
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:58,704
[caribou] Stampede!

209
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,332
-I'm ready.
-I was hopin' you'd say that.

210
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,042
You're cleared for takeoff.

211
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,211
Show 'em what you're made of,

212
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,463
but do it in style!

213
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,674
Now you're runway-ready!

214
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,425
[caribou] Stampede!

215
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,053
[Ridley] Whoa!

216
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,388
[grunts]

217
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,682
[gasps, grunts]

218
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:19,267
Ah!

219
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,394
[caribou] Stampede!

220
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:22,395
[grunts]

221
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:23,813
[yelps]

222
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,940
Whoa! Whoa!

223
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:28,484
-Oh, I can't watch!
-I can't stop watching.

224
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,819
[grunts]

225
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,154
That's one giant leap for girlkind!

226
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,073
[twinkling]

227
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,408
[grunts]

228
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,827
Hi! I'm Ridley. Nice to meet you.

229
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,496
Would love to chat, but gotta mosey.
[grunts]

230
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,789
Stampede. Stampede.

231
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:42,999
-Hi!
-[screams]

232
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,251
I mean, hi. I mean, what are you doing?

233
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,836
Trying to get that necklace back.

234
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,338
-[gasps] What necklace?
-The one on your horns.

235
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,800
[gasps] There's a necklace on my horns?
Get it off! Get it off!

236
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,428
If you could just stop stampeding,
I could grab it.

237
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,472
The thing about a stampede is
you can't stop.

238
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,808
Stampede!

239
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,728
Ridley's in a hoof load of trouble.

240
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,605
-We gotta help her.
-Do we?

241
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,941
A good queen always protects her friends.

242
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,568
Who's with us?

243
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,653
[groans]

244
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:16,073
We gotta orbit those caribou
back into their exhibit.

245
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,242
That way, they won't destroy anything

246
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:19,577
else.

247
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,495
Stampede!

248
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:22,913
Stampede!

249
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,999
Stampede!

250
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,418
Stampede! Stampede!

251
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:28,419
Whoa!

252
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,504
[piano notes playing]

253
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:31,839
[caribou panting]

254
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,049
[Ridley gasps]

255
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:34,592
[Ridley] Whoa!

256
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:37,011
[caribou] Stampede! Stampede! Stampede!

257
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,804
[adventurous music playing]

258
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:42,141
I know this is shocking,
but it's time to power down!

259
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,142
[hooves rumbling]

260
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:46,604
The pottery exhibit
is closed to stampedes today!

261
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,398
Uh, please fasten your seat belts,

262
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,275
put your tray tables upright,

263
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,778
and thank you for flying
with Dodo Airlines!

264
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,196
[tires screech]

265
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,448
The eagle has landed!

266
00:10:57,531 --> 00:11:00,409
Ridley! We gotta get 'em back
into the exhibit.

267
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,119
I don't have the necklace yet.

268
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,245
Now or never!

269
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,081
Well, in that case, now!

270
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,124
Bisonic choice!

271
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,626
[grunts]

272
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,002
[sighs]

273
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,797
Did you complete your mission?

274
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,756
Yep.

275
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,883
-Juras-sick.
-That was royal.

276
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:18,094
I have to get it to my mom.

277
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,929
Mom! Mom!

278
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:20,971
[shushes]

279
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,306
[chattering]

280
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,143
I'm afraid the necklace is

281
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,146
magnificent!

282
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,441
I guess everything is in order this time.

283
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:36,904
But I'll be back.
I'm watching you, Joneses!

284
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,739
Thank you for coming, Mr. Peabody.

285
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,199
I'll walk you out.

286
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,659
I told you I was ready.

287
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,494
[chuckles] But how did you get this?

288
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:44,453
[gasps]

289
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,706
-You met--
-Mm-hmm.

290
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,959
So, I have a lot of explaining to do.

291
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,670
And so do you.

292
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:53,963
[chuckles] About that…

293
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:57,842
I know this doesn't look great,
but, um, I am ready to run this place.

294
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,593
I don't think so.

295
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,430
But maybe you're ready
for me to start teaching you.

296
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,974
-Yes!
-Oh, Juras-sick!

297
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,143
You made your mummy proud!

298
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:11,564
As someone wise once told me,
you don't start a journey at the end.

299
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,524
There's so much to explain.

300
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:16,360
But I think we should
jump right into lesson number one.

301
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,611
Yes? What is it?

302
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,280
-Cleaning up.
-[laughs]

303
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:20,656
Cool. I can do that.

304
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,367
And your new ground crew can help.

305
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,870
-[Ismat] Mummazing!
-[Dante] Mesozoic!

306
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,374
[Ridley] Some like it hot.

307
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,251
[Lonny over PA] Attention, guests.

308
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,961
The museum is now closing.

309
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:36,547
-Unless you're planning on moving in…
-I don't wanna go.

310
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,467
Thanks for coming! Exit's this way.
See you soon!

311
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,593
Bye!

312
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,888
Phew! That's the last of the guests.

313
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:47,767
Coast is clear.
Everyone can come out now, right?

314
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,602
[laughs] Someone's antsy tonight.

315
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,729
-[mystical twinkling]
-I can't help it.

316
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:54,106
Now that I know the truth
about the museum,

317
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,942
all I can think about
is going on adventures!

318
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,778
[gasps] Adventures?

319
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,489
So you're sure you're ready
to start your training?

320
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,240
-Yep.
-You're sure you're sure?

321
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,451
The surest! I was born ready!

322
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:06,660
Well, that's true.

323
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,871
-[both] Okay.
-Yes!

324
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,917
The women of our family
have always taken care of the museum.

325
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,879
Our job is and always has been
to take care of the artifacts

326
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,006
who make their home here
and preserve them.

327
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,508
Mm-hmm. Yep. Got it.

328
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:24,637
And learn from these cultures and history,
recent and ancient.

329
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,138
Uh-huh. I know!

330
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,432
It's also our job to return artifacts

331
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,060
whenever we can find their home
or their people…

332
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,812
Oh my gosh. Are we still talking?

333
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:36,232
Mama, Grandma,
the Jones family history is super cool,

334
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:39,652
but when I found out that the museum,
you know, comes to life at night,

335
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,570
I thought I'd be going on adventures!

336
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:45,616
Traipsing through jungles,
rushing through temples, eating bugs…

337
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,827
Okay, maybe not that last one.

338
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:51,288
[sighs] Ridley, most of the job
isn't about adventures.

339
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:52,957
It's about keeping the peace.

340
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,167
This is part of training. [sighs]

341
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:58,337
But you can go into the museum
and meet everyone.

342
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,257
Now that's more like it!
Bye, Mama! Bye, Grandma!

343
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,884
Hey there! Oh, how's it going?

344
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:07,596
Mrs. Sanchez, did you do something new
with your tail?

345
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,934
You noticed! Thank you, dear!

346
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,936
-Bison's greetings to ya!
-Ridley!

347
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,564
[grunts] Be careful of your queen!

348
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,691
Ismat, you're not our queen.

00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,000
Hmm. It's 200 pounds.

522
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,960
Uh, wait, that's a baby elephant.

523
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,420
-Hold, please!
-[beep]

524
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:39,256
[easy-listening music playing]

525
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,173
Here we go.

526
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,633
Great. Thanks.

527
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:44,303
[gasps] I know what to do.

528
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,888
Can you guys start
passing me up some sand?

529
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:50,058
Hope I get this right.
We'll only have one shot at it.

530
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,144
[pensive music playing]

531
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,400
[groaning]

532
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,527
No rockslide. Phew!

533
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,570
-Yes!
-Go, Ridley!

534
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:02,529
Nice!

535
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,990
Oops. Total tail-fail.

536
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:08,118
-[Dudley gasps] Rockslide!
-[Ridley] Everyone, run! Go!

537
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,828
-[yelps, grunts]
-[Ridley] Dudley!

538
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:12,789
I told you, dodos don't do deserts!

539
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,666
Don't worry, buddy. I've got you.

540
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,043
[grunts]

541
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:20,630
[Dudley] I was so close
to becoming permanently extinct!

542
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:21,715
[grunts]

543
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,175
Pedro, are you okay?

544
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,219
That was awesome!

545
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,638
But can we go home now?

546
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:30,307
[chuckles] Definitely.

547
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:34,102
[sighs] I can't believe we got out okay!

548
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:37,814
Ridley, your quick thinking
was a crowning achievement.

549
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:42,569
Not to mention how I helped
Ridley and Pedro swing away at the end.

550
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,614
We'll let him have that one.

551
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,699
I'm just glad we're all out of danger!

552
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,577
Pedro! Oh, my little pingüino!

553
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,912
I was so worried.

554
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:53,622
Thank you for finding my son.

555
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:54,539
Of course.

556
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:59,086
And, Pedro, I don't think either of us
is ready for dangerous adventures yet.

557
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:02,005
We might need to learn
some stuff before we are.

558
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:05,967
Mama, Grandma, before you get mad…

559
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,553
We're just glad you're safe.

560
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,764
I'm sorry I didn't listen to you.

561
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:15,227
We almost got run over by an elephant,
smushed by rocks, and dried up by the sun!

562
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:20,690
Which is probably why
you wanted me to learn about the museum.

563
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:23,110
How about we get back to that training?

564
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:27,614
[Mama] So, you have to keep the elephants
away from the ancient pottery.

565
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:30,909
And the models of ancient ships
out of the bathrooms.

566
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:32,452
They're desperate for water,

567
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:35,330
and they do clog the toilets
no matter what they tell you.

568
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,373
[Ridley laughs]

569
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:39,334
And the penguins out of the desert.
Got it.

570
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,961
[chuckles] You done for today?

571
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:44,047
Nope. Let's dive into gemstones.

572
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,343
[closing theme music playing]

573
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,388
