I'm gonna spacewalk right out that door,

and fix the booster!

"Spacewalk"? Like walk in space?

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,441
No need to unbuckle, Bucko.
I'm going out alone.

182
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:06,152
But the manual says it's a two-person job.

And besides, going out
by yourself in space?

184
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:13,868
Yep. Like I said, things are
just easier when I fly solo.
