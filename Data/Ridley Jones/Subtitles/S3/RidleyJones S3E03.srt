Aw! The door's totally locked!

173
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,227
A little help, Peaches?

174
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,812
[Peaches]
I can't unlock the door from up here!

175
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,315
Time to fly like an eagle.

176
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:48,402
If I could fly, that is,
and if I was an eagle, that is.

177
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:50,613
I don't wanna talk about it.

178
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:56,369
Anyway, you can get
in the office through the ceiling.

179
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:59,539
Great work. Dante, do you mind
giving us a boost?

180
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,959
One dino-pault, courtesy of Ralph,
coming right up.

181
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:03,960
Ha-ha!

182
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,423
[Ridley, gasps] Mr. Peabody!

183
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,175
O-M-Ra! Is he down there?

184
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:15,429
Phew! No, just a really big
portrait of him.

185
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,765
-[shudders]
-Do you see Paola anywhere?

186
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,396
She must be in there.

187
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:27,108
Peaches, think you can get me
the combo for Peabody's safe?

188
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:28,818
[gasps] Wait, cancel that.

189
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:32,154
He left the safe open. Oh, Mr. P.

190
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:36,033
Ridley! Oh! My cannoli-sized heroine!

191
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,202
[Peaches]
Get your keisters out of that office!

192
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,956
Mr. P and Luann just pulled
into the parking lot.

193
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,834
On it, Peaches.
Grandma! Ismat! Bring us up!

194
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,422
Mr. P is back.
We need to get out of here fast.

195
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:53,509
That's why your getaway board
and bison stuck around. Hop on!

196
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:01,392
Museum Mayday!
Everyone, get back to your exhibits!

197
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:07,565
That's Luann, a greedy art collector.

198
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:10,610
We got you out of Peabody's office
just in time.

199
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,653
Grazie! Now I am safe.

200
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:13,988
I'm afraid not.

201
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:16,282
Now that Mr. Peabody
knows you're in the museum,

202
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,867
he'll never stop looking for you.

203
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,286
You'll be in danger forever.

204
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:25,916
Well, it's the price I pay for being
the most famous painting in the world.

205
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,546
Curse my charisma,
flawless brushwork, and mysterious smile

206
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,548
that leaves everyone wanting more.

207
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,425
Eh, I guess it's back to storage.

208
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:37,720
No, I won't let you go back in there.
You deserve to be seen.

209
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,181
You've done your best
to protect me, Sylvia.

210
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:41,098
[chuckles]

211
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:45,102
After all, where can I go?
It's not like I can hide in plain sight.

212
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,020
[gasps]

213
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:50,399
Maybe you can.
Grandma, stall Mr. Peabody and Luann.

214
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,484
What you thinking?

215
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:55,571
I might know how to get Peabody
off of Paola's trail for good.

216
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,950
Behold! The most expensive--

217
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:03,537
Ahem, I mean,
exquisite painting in the world.

218
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,790
A Lady from Milan.

219
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,335
You've really done it this time.

220
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,379
Eh, sometimes I even surprise myself.

221
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:14,632
Is this a joke?
That's a poster from the gift shop.

222
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,258
The price tag is still on it.

223
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,761
Uh, I-I-I can't believe it.

224
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,054
[laughing]

225
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:23,724
Luann, wait!
I thought it was the real portrait!

226
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,602
Luann!

227
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:27,937
Arrivederci!

228
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,148
[sings operatic notes]

229
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:36,612
Mamma mia!
Are you really hiding me in plain sight?

230
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,030
Do you think that'll work?

231
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,740
We're about to find out.

232
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:44,662
I can't believe I thought one of these
gift shop posters was the real portrait.

233
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:48,290
Sometimes we can't see
what's right in front of us.

234
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,208
[sighs]

235
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:52,503
Looks like A Lady from Milan
has truly disappeared,

236
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:56,090
and the mystery
will stay a mystery forever.

237
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,635
[man]
It looks just like the real portrait.

238
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,595
-Take my picture.
-[camera shutter clicks]

239
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:03,723
Hey there!

240
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:04,724
Ha-ha!

241
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,016
Sylvi-yucha.

242
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,309
Paol-ucha!

243
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:11,355
I love it here. Grazie.
Thank you, both of you.

244
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,066
You Jones women
sure know how to make a lady smile.

245
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,319
-I wanna see what's on the second floor.
-This is so cool!

246
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:21,240
I guess being a protector of the museum
really is an art.

247
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,951
-[man] Simply stunning!
-[girl] I wanna paint.

248
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,786
[boy]
I wonder why she's smiling.

249
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,915
[Ridley]
Gift of the Mummy.

250
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:34,628
Welcome, all,
to Dudley's very first flying recital!

251
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,380
[all whoop and cheer]

252
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:41,093
Oh, we couldn't be more proud
of the progress our D-Man has made.

253
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:45,639
I'm so happy you all were able to make it
and, uh-- Hey, where's Ismat?

254
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,893
[Ismat] Not in that corner!
Is that gingham in gold?

255
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:52,188
Sorry, Dudley.
I think we better go check on Ismat.

256
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:55,691
Uh, hey, Pierce and Flo?
We'll need to take a rain check!

257
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,444
Yes, that looks good.

258
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,988
And remember,
everything has to be perfect.

259
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:03,240
Hey, Ismat, what's going on in here?

260
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:06,410
This is over-the-top, even for you.

261
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:09,538
I'm setting up
for my dads' anniversary party.

262
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:14,001
It's the big one.
Forty-five hundred years.

263
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,169
[Fred] Bisonic!

264
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:20,382
I know! Look,
I even made matching lockets as a gift.

265
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,968
I'm so excited to give them to my dads.

266
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:26,972
That's a great photo of the three of you.
I'm sure they'll love it.

267
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,015
[Aten] Wow!

268
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:30,643
Ismat, the place looks fabulous.

269
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:33,687
[gasps] You even made the baklava cake
that we love!

270
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,649
We've been looking forward
to this party all millennium!

271

Ah! Ouch!

[laughs]
It's actually gold, Dudley.

289
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,401
You can't eat it.

290
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:08,657
My un-queenly little gift can't compete
with all these other fabulous ones.

291
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,076
Wait. I know!

292
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,580
Dads, I gotta run
one last errand before the party.

293
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,081
Okay, Ismat. Seeya soon.

294
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,626
Well, we'll just be here eating cake.

295
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:22,212
Thanks for making one
for every year we've been together.

296
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,422
-Delicious!
-Yum!

297
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,299
-Ridley!
-Whoa!

298
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:28,636
Will you open the entrance
to the real pyramids?

299
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,679
I need to get a new gift for my dads.

300
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,765
"A new gift"? What about the lockets?

301
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:35,392
These little trinkets? Ugh!

302
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:39,605
You saw all those
magnificent presents my dads got.

303
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:45,653
I need to get them something like that.
Something big and extravagant.

304
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,696
What did you have in mind?

305
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:53,744
A golden statue that was made
in my dads' honor a really long time ago.

306
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,454
It'll be the perfect gift.

307
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:56,872
-Wow!
-[Peaches] Sounds fancy!

308
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,165
Where is it now?

309
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:02,211
The exact location's been lost to time.
Hashtag "mummy problems."

310
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:05,214
But I'm sure it's
in the Pyramid of Secrets,

311
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:09,218
and with all your help,
I know we can track it down.

312
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,220
Yeah, we can. Right, Ridley?

313
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,931
I still think the lockets
are the right gift.

314
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:15,766
[sighs]

315
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:19,812
But if you think the statue is better,
then Eyes Team, let's head out.

316
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,438
Peaches, do your thing.

317
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:24,400
Okay, I'll mosey on over
to the security room.

318
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,651
Call if you need help.

319
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,778
-Let's do this!
-[all] Eyes!

320
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,741
Ancient pyramids, here we come!

321
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:37,621
There it is. The Pyramid of Secrets.

322
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,415
-Cool!
-Whoa!

323
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,792
It's bodaciously beautiful.

324
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:45,129
It is, but don't be fooled
by how it looks.

325
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,256
The Pyramid of Secrets is a maze

326
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:52,886
of secret passageways,
booby traps, and hidden dangers.

327
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,306
-[Fred] Wow!
-Uh, is it too late to, uh, turn back?

328
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,601
The statue should be
in the pyramid's vault.

329
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,938
Though I'm not exactly sure where that is.

330
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,691
Peaches, think you can find
a map of this pyramid?

331
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:08,777
Already on it, Ridley. Okay.
What do we have here?

332
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:12,656
Ancient Athens. Ancient Atlantis.
Ancient Atlanta.

333
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,324
Bob's Banana Palace?

334
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,285
Wait, that's a takeout menu!

335
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,787
[laughs]
Just let us know when you find it.

336
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:22,166
Okay, Eyes Team,
let's see what we can see.

337
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,797

-Dudley!

-[Ridley] Dead end!
-What do we do?

342
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:39,224
Ralph! Do something!

343
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:43,854

Huh?

346

You all remember
I'm mummy royalty, right?

347
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:53,864
Guards! Look!
You are in the presence of your queen!

348
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,407
Your Highness!

349
00:17:55,491 --> 00:18:00,537
I mean, hi! It's Ismat, Mummy Queen here.
How's it going?

350
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:01,955
A thousand apologies.

351
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,124
We, uh, didn't realize.

352
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,878
Did you do something different
with your wraps? They look amazing.

353
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:10,005
What are you doing here, my liege?

354
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:14,760
Well, I need to get something valuable
out of the treasure vault.

355
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:21,100
What? But it's rumored to be hidden in
the deepest darkest corner of the pyramid.

356
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:25,521
Surely, whatever you seek isn't
more valuable than your royal safety.

357
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,939
-Oh!
-Never mind.

358
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:30,400
It is not our place
to question our queen's wishes. Farewell.

359
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:36,448
Okay, handled. Now, let's keep moving.
I have to find that statue.

360
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,951
Peaches? Any luck with the map?

361
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:42,830
Affirmative. Looks like the vault
is on the lowest level of the pyramid.

362
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,332
So you're gonna need
to take the corridor to the east,

363
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:49,253
next to the giant banana peel--
Oops. That's my bad.

364
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:52,965
Now go down the corridor
with the funny-looking floor tiles…

365
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:54,716
[Fred snorts]

366
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,927
Easy. We've got this.

[whimpers]

370
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,641
Maybe not so easy.

371
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:06,353
Ismat, any idea what that symbol means?

372
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:09,898
Yes! It's the ancient Egyptian symbol
for the number one.

373
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,943
And that tile there has the number two.

374
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:16,446
There's three, four, five, and six.

375
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,741
I'm guessing we'll need to jump
from one number tile to the next

376
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,494
to get down the hall safely.
Stay on the numbered tiles.

377
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,704
Got it.

378
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:24,621

382
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:35,299
And by surfing,
I mean hopping, and by gnar,

383
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,925
I mean giant tiles. And by--

384
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,761
Dante, you can hop quietly, you know.

385
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:40,679
Ready?

386
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:42,973
Huh?

387
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,766
Don't worry, Dudley. I'll help you.

[both grunt]

389
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,229
See? It's just like hopscotch.

390
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:53,567
Like hopscotch with a side of doom!

391
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,196
[Ridley] Okay. Now let's keep going.

392
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,697
[Peaches] Great work, team!

393
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,992
You're just one corridor away
from the pyramid vault!

394
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,620
Perfect gift, here we come!

395
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,497
Uh, did I do that?

397
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:13,420
Peaches, we're going down a big slide!

398
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:15,380
[Peaches] What? We have a problem!

399
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,466

Ridley, y'all okay?

402
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:25,224
Uh-huh. We're now in a room
with a big pit.

403
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,184
[gasps]
And there's a staircase

404
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,644
with daylight behind us!

405
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,146
Copy that, sunshine.
I know where you are.

406
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,649
Those stairs lead safely outside.

407
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,735
The treasure vault
is on the other side of that pit.

408
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,906
Yeah, and the only way across
is using that slippery-looking rock.

409
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:44,076
Whoa, I can't even see the bottom.

410
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,456
If we fell-- I'm calling it. I'm sorry,
Ismat, but it's too dangerous.

411
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:53,210
Go if you want, but I need
to get that statue for my dads.

412
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:56,088
Otherwise, they won't know
how much I love them.

413
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:57,547
Ismat, wait!

414
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:00,884
No bottomless pit is gonna stop me!

415
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,928
Stay here. I'll go after her.

solid gold statues so heavy?
