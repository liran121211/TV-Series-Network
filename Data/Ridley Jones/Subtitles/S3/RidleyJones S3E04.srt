00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:09,510
I wouldn't mind a break.
Plus, Mr. Peabody might be right.

343
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:12,680
I don't really fit in
with all these newfangled exhibits.

344
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,432
Wait, that gives me an idea.

345
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:21,855
Mr. Peabody said you stuck out too much
next to the new VR technology, right?

346
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:25,567
So, we just have to find a part
of the museum where you fit in better.

347
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,027
If you think it's possible.

348
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,363
It has to be.
I won't let them get rid of you.

349
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,532
First up is the tundra exhibit.

350
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:35,244
We can move you here, and during the day
you can greet guests

351
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,787
and tell them about the exhibit.

352
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:42,084
Like how it was discovered
5,000 years ago by Marianne Tundra

353
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:45,295
after her Frisbee was stolen by a walrus.

354
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,672
Whoa, really?

355
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:49,466
Wait. Dudley! No, it wasn't.

356
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,344
Oh, sorry. When I don't know something,

357
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,930
I usually just make things up
and hope I'm right.

358
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,598
And I'm never right.

359
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:00,102
Well, this is new to me.
But I'll give it a try.

and enjoy the wonders of the tundra.

As engineer, shouldn't you
be keeping your peepers on the road?

374
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:47,524
Actually, steam trains run on tracks
instead of roads.

375
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:51,111
Though I guess since this
is a museum train, it wouldn't run on--

to the Zimbabwe exhibit.

Oh, just taking in
the beautiful sight of the snowfall.

The Arctic exhibit is amazing, isn't it?
I've never been.

396
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:39,785
We couldn't find the right place
for you in the museum,

397
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,454
because there is
no right place in the museum.

You can't leave the museum.
The Arctic is cold.
