A totes sluggish avalanche.

174
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:23,437
Huh.

175
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:24,730
[Ismat exclaims]

176
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:26,357
I got you.

177
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,110
Oh, no! The toolbox!

178
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,612
Don't worry. We're in low gravity.

179
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:37,118
This avalanche is no match
for a mighty bison.

180
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,494
[grunts]

181
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,830
Catch you later, space rock gator.

182
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,585
Someone get a picture of me looking
all strong and send it to the eagles.

183
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:46,669
[laughs]

184
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,005
I don't think asteroids have Wi-Fi.

185
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,257
Ow!

186
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,968
Whoa!

187
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,978
[screaming and sobbing]

188
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,021
Don't you worry!

189
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,648
My astronaut training
taught me what to do!

190
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:12,111
Hang on, honey bunch!
Peaches is a-comin'!

191
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,656
Heavens, I missed this.

192
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,659
Help me, Peaches! You're my only hope!

193
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,412
Dudley, you gotta slow yourself
down a smidge.

194
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:26,083
I'm trying, but I don't think dodo wings
were made for interstellar flapping.

195
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,169
I think I got me an idea.

196
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:32,214
Yee-haw! I love outer space!

197
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,676
Almost as much as three
whole banana butterscotch sundaes.

198
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,304
Birds, am I glad to see you!

199
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,307
I'll always be there to catch you.

200
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:44,185
And I'll always be there to be caught.

201
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,523
That was incredible.

202
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,485
You really do belong here in space.

203
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:57,031
Peaches, if you wanted to stay,
we'd understand.

204
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:58,699
I'm not gonna lie.

205
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,619
The view up here is prettier
than peas in a pork chop,

206
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:05,122
and the adventure of the cosmos
makes my little heart pitter-pat

207
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,332
like a whole lotta--

208
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:09,293
Uh, Peaches. I'm floating away again.

209
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:15,257
But I can't always be there
to catch Dudley if I'm out in space.

210
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,468
Thank you kindly, Gladys, but right now,

211
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:21,305
my greatest adventure is helping Ridley
be the best protector she can be.

212
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,765
That's where my heart is.

213
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,433
[all] Aw!

214
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,728
We should head home.
You know Mama, she'll be worried.

215
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:31,565
Take this communicator
and give me a call anytime.

216
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:34,527
Now that we know how to work
that black hole doohickey,

217
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:38,656
I'll be here the next time
I get a hankering for space adventure.

218
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:41,492
I will miss you. I will miss you all.

219
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,327
Until then, goodbye.

00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,996

223
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,881
Smooth as Saturn.
How's your frozen banana?

224
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:59,093
I think asteroid frozen
butterscotch bananas

225
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,053
might be my new favorite.

226
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:05,474
What say we try and rock it up
a notch in Jupiter gear.

227
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,102
[Peaches] Let's go, antigravity!

00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:10,813
-Dude!
-Go, Peaches!

229
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:14,066
I'm gonna give that pyramid another try.

230
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,485
Still okay with coming back down to Earth?

231
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:20,948
Bless my soul. I'd never want to miss
an adventure like this one.

You should join the Rotundas.
We could do a dueling drums thing and--

Oh, I'd love to, but I can't.

268
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:23,237
Oh, okay. But why?

269
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,073
I'm too small to be in your band. See?

270
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,325
I can barely reach the pedal.

271
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,370
You know, I wasn't the big, tough bison
you see before you

272
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:34,665
when I first started to learn the drums.
I was just a calf.

No way!

274
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,295
I used to rock out
in the Saturn model all day long.

This is a museum, not a concert.

288
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:10,784
I don't like music. The way it makes me
feel things is horrifying.

Wait. All that noise
was coming from this?

Hey, Mr. Peabody. Just practicing.

-Hmm.

Now, what is that?
I have to make it stop immediately. Lonny!

301
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:46,987
Well, that was a close call
if I've ever laid my eyes on one.

302
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:50,032
Yeah, and I wonder who
that special guest is.

303

Knowing Mr. Peabody, it can't be good.

304
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:56,872
Hey, my cymbal is missing.
It's gotta be around here somewhere.

305
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,625
What in ancient Egypt is that?

306
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:04,171
I don't want to freak anyone out,
but it's gotta be a ghost!

307
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,465
Naw, it's probably the pipes.

308
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:08,676
I accidentally flushed a board
the other day.

309
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:12,137
Turns out the inside of a toilet
does not make a good half-pipe.

310
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:15,391
Doesn't it kind of sound like
the beat to a song?

311
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,601

-That's my beat.

That's gotta be Evie.

314
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:26,777
She loved my drum solo,
so I tried to give her my cymbal to play.

315
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,238
The one that's now missing.

316
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:32,616
That means Mr. Peabody
is looking for Evie!

317
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,203
We gotta find her before Mr. P does.
Follow that beat!

-[Ismat] Evie!
-Now what?

327
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:01,562
Well, we checked in every
sarcophagus and pyramid…

328
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:05,691
Not to mention up the Sphinx's nose.
Gnarly!

329

-It's Mr. Peabody! Again! Hide!

330
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,321
[Dudley] Oh, feathers.

331
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:16,368
Miss Jones? But where were
all those voices coming from?

332
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:20,372
Oh, that was all me, Mr. Peabody.

333
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:23,917
Well, that makes no sense.
I heard at least four different voices.

334
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:27,963
I was just seeing
how many different voices I could do.

335
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,006
"Heya, sunshine."

336
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,758
"Mesozoic."

337
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:36,722
"It's queen, remember?" "Bisonic."
"Honk!" "Dodos don't do deserts."

338
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,682
I don't sound like that, do I?

339
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:41,477
Okay, keep your voices to yourself.

340
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,689

by Jones family shenanigans.
