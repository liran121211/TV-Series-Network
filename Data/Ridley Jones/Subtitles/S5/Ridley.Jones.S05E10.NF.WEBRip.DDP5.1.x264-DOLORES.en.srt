1
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:13,886
In a place full of mystery

2
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:15,852
Where the past comes alive

3
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:17,982
There's a hero of history

4
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:20,019
Who is ready to thrive

5
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:24,023
She is saving our future
By protecting our past

6
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:27,237
She's a hero
Whose moment's arriving at last

7
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:29,278
Ridley Jones

8
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,452
Daring and bold and courageous

9
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,491
Ridley Jones

10
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,615
Guards the museum with pride

11
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,412
Ridley Jones

12
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:40,575
Her sense of adventure's contagious

13
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:44,035
With dinos and dodos
And astronaut chimps by her side

14
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,167
Ridley Jones

15
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:48,174
Wearing her trademark fedora

16
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:50,216
Ridley Jones

17
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,390
No challenge can get in her way

18
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:55,389
She won't ever give in to her fear

19
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,432
She shines when adventure is near

20
00:00:57,515 --> 00:01:00,845
Swinging into the fray
And then saving the day

21
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:03,645
Ridley Jones

22
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,857
Ridley Jones

23
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,110
Ready, Pet, Go.

24
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,945
Well, would you look at that?

25
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,325
-Out of this world.
-Mummazing.

26
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:22,672
Ooh, it looks like
a fossilized triceratops skeleton.

27
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,079
Sure does.

28
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:29,167
I've found dinosaur bones before,
but never anything this well-preserved.

29
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:31,262
There's one bone missing.

30
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:34,801
Has anyone found anything
that looks like a tibia bone?

31
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:41,308
Are tibia bones round and squishy?

32
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:42,852
No? Then not me.

33
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:46,976
I found this diamond,
but it royally clashes with my crown.

34
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,322
I've got something. Is this it?

35
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,150
Indeed, it is.

36
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,534
Well done, Ridley.

37
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:58,196
O-M-Egypt.

38
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,544
I guess it wants to see me.

39
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:13,423
Bananas! Aw, little guy
just wants to play fetch.

40
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:15,723
Good boy.

41
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:21,352
Well, aren't you just
the cutest little fossil I've ever seen?

42
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:23,692
Is it really that cute?

43
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,225
How cute!

44
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:30,653
I wonder what
we should call our little dino bro.

45
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:34,823
What should we name you? How about Tibby?

46
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,574
Short for "tibia."

47
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,951
Sounds like Tibby agrees.

48
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:42,834
It's time to get this fossil
back to the museum.

49
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,079
Welcome to your new home, Tibby.

50
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,127
Now let's find someone
who can take care of you.

51
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:53,798
Not it. I'm not a dog guy.

52
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,262
-Who doesn't like dogs?
-Me!

53
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,473
So drooly.

54
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,760
What about you, Dante?

55
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,894
Tibby could be
the perfect dino pet for you.

56
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:08,475
Oh, I'd love to have Tibula around,
but I'm only 65 million years old.

57
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,613
I'm not ready for that commitment.

58
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,860
Taking care of a pet
is a Jurassic responsibility.

59
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,106
How about you, Fred?

60
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,657
Living with Tibby could be bisonic.

61
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,122
On second thought…

62
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:33,837
Sorry, sunshine.
My exhibit isn't exactly pet-proof.

63
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:38,762
Hey! Lay off the licking, Tibbs.
These boots are made for space walking.

64
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,890
I would adopt Tibby,

65
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,219
but I already have a cat.

66
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:48,017
And Cleo's so much work… for my subjects.

67
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:50,362
Queens don't do litter boxes.

68
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:55,818
We're sorry, Ridley.
We all royally adore Tibby.

69
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,782
-We just, like, can't adopt him.
-It's okay.

70
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:03,656
I just want to find someone
who loves him as much as I do.

71
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,584
Wait. That's it.

72
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,623
I love Tibby. I should adopt him.

73
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,671
So, what do you think? Can I keep Tibby?

74
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,052
Please?

75
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,380
Your grandma and I
sort of have our hands full.

76
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:21,466
Literally. Now that
these scrolls are restored,

77
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:24,762
we've got to return them
to the Library of Thoth.

78
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:29,887
You and Grandma won't have to do a thing.
I'll take care of Tibby all by myself.

79
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,148
Protector's honour.

80
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:35,019
A pet is a big responsibility.
You have to be sure you're ready.

81
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,688
I'm always ready.

82
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,986
I mean, I've done a great job
so far, haven't I?

83
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:44,121
But it's only been one afternoon.
A pet is a lifetime commitment.

84
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:49,210
I can handle it, no problem.
I'm an advanced protector now, remember?

85
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,829
I suppose you're right.

86
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:54,285
A journey doesn't start at the end.
And he sure is cute.

87
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,667
Thanks, Mum. I won't let you down.

88
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:03,678
I'm still not a dog fan,
but I do love a good adoption ceremony.

89
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:07,221
With great joy and queenly pleasure,

90
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:12,807
I now pronounce
Tibby Jones officially adopted.

91
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:14,862
Yeah!

92
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,110
Now you're all mine, Tibby.

93
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:21,449
Are you ready to join us
for museum rounds?

94
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:22,906
Oh! Tibby!

95
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:29,115
Let's see. We've bathed the sloths,
oiled the robotics exhibit.

96
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,583
We just have to dust the pottery. Whoa!

97
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,125
Tibby! Stop!

98
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:38,338
Come back!

99
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,915
Okay, minor setback. No big deal.

100
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,848
We cleaned up the mud,
and now we just have to dust the pottery.

101
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:46,798
Whoa!

102
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,512
Tibby, no!

103
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,268
Back on track. I can handle this.

104
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,186
Not now, Tibby.

105
00:05:57,273 --> 00:06:00,403
We have to finish cleaning up
before we can play.

106
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:04,855
Don't worry, Ridudely.
I got this. Go long, Tibula.

107
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,577
Wait, what is that?

108
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,869
Whoa. Where did Tibula get this?

109
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:15,083
That looks like one of the scrolls
Mum and Grandma restored today.

110
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,876
I recognize that stamp.

111
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,879
It's the symbol of Thoth,
the God of Wisdom.

112
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:21,672
Thoth? That's right.

113
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,966
Grandma was bringing them
back to the Library of Thoth.

114
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:29,221
My dads told me that library
is protected by so many booby traps

115
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:32,725
only the most advanced protector
can even get in there.

116
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:37,146
Legend has it Thoth didn't want
any of his knowledge stolen,

117
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,820
so he put a curse on the place
in case anything went missing.

118
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:46,780
If that scroll isn't returned by midnight,
the Library of Thoth will self-destruct.

119
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:48,948
Not the library!

120
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:54,290
Oh, no. All those other scrolls,
all of that ancient knowledge,

121
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:55,672
will be lost.

122
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,878
And it will all be my fault.

123
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:01,169
Technically, it will all be Tibby's fault.

124
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,632
Not helping, got it. Sorry.

125
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:07,045
I can't believe I let this happen.

126
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,295
My job is to protect history,

127
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:13,177
and instead,
I might be the reason it gets destroyed.

128
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:18,188
Plus, that scroll means Tibby wandered off

129
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:23,191
into a dangerous, cursed, ancient library,
and I had no idea.

130
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,146
-He could have got hurt.
-That's okay, sunshine.

131
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:29,777
Tibby looks happier
than a mule in a mud mask.

132
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,786
This time. But that's not the point.

133
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,749
Maybe Mum was right.

134
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,079
Maybe I'm not ready for a pet.

135
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:40,535
I love you, Tibby,
but I'm in way over my head.

136
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:43,843
I'm sorry. I have to un-adopt you.

137
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:46,048
For your own good.

138
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,592
I'll find you a new home
as soon as we get back, okay?

139
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:53,097
But first,
there's a library that needs saving.

140
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,388
-You got it.
-Sure thing.

141
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:07,491
You weren't kidding
about those booby traps, Princess.

142
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,200
How did Tibby get out?

143
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:12,577
Come on, Eyes Team.
We've got a scroll to return.

144
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:26,554
Why is dodo always on the menu?

145
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,274
Looks like we've got company.

146
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:40,018
Tibby, how'd you follow us?

147
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,402
Tibby, no. It's not safe.

148
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:48,904
Nice doggy.

149
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,202
Nice job, Dudley.

150
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:56,446
-I told you, I am not a dog guy.
-Let's keep going.

151
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:05,712
Of course. Tibby's been here before.
He knows where to go.

152
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:06,665
Royal!

153
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:07,594
Nice work.

154
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,762
-Jurassick!
-O-M-Ra!

155
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,055
Bisonic!

156
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,928
Now all we have to do
is put the scroll back.

157
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,516
That wasn't so bad, right? Whoa!

158
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:23,693
Not so bad?

159
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:27,611
Okay, let's think.
If we can just deactivate the booby trap…

160
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:28,902
Tibby, no!

161
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,285
-Go, Tibula!
-Yeah!

162
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,450
Let's do this.

163
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,418
Over here!

164
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:50,505
All right!

165
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,879
Yippee!

166
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:53,967
We did it.

167
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:56,801
-Fantastic.
-Now let's get out of here.

168
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,965
Tibby!

169
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:04,895
What's the matter, sunshine?
The mission was a whopping success.

170
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:09,279
I know, but I already
made up my mind to give up Tibby.

171
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:12,898
I can't take
as good care of him as I'd like.

172
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:16,987
But you already adopted him.
He's part of your herd.

173
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:20,044
Totes.
There's no take-backsies on adoption.

174
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,409
Yeah, you can't abandon him.

175
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:28,166
As the last of my kind, I know a thing
or two about how it feels to be all alone.

176
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:33,087
Plus, Tibby's starting to grow on me.

177
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,644
He just needs a little training, is all.

178
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,388
I wasn't born
a stellar astronaut, you know.

179
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,601
I had to train before soaring into space.

180
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:44,852
Just like you had to train
to be a protector.

181
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,555
Really? You think so?

182
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,322
Pets take work, there's no doubt

183
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:56,491
But you made a promise
That you'd stick it out

184
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,448
That's what love's all about

185
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,947
Training's tough, I suppose

186
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:08,498
But look at that cute horn
On his cute dino nose

187
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,923
Plus, it's the choice you chose

188
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,588
It may not be easy

189
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,425
But, Ridley, don't you see?

190
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:23,351
We don't give up when it's our family

191
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:27,475
Buckle down, don't quit yet

192
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:31,571
It pays off
With all the snuggles that you get

193
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,528
Oh, how you'll love your pet

194
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,985
Soon enough, he'll be trained

195
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:44,123
You'll forget the things
He's eaten, chewed or stained

196
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:47,083
With all the love you've gained

197
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:50,878
I know it won't be easy

198
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,590
But this I guarantee

199
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:58,591
I won't give up
'Cause you're my family

200
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,925
And we're here to help.

201
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,018
Thanks, guys. Wait a minute.

202
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,520
Where did Tibby go? Tibby?

203
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,693
-Oh.
-Passport, please.

204
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,704
For saving the Library of Thoth?

205
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,409
For learning that love is forever.

206
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,122
Yeah. It is.
