[Ridley] Ms. Peabody, I Presume?

23
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,830
Bye. See you next time.

24
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,829
-Thank you.
-[girl] Museums rock!

25
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,161
Oh, hi, Mr. Peabody.

26
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,616
I don't like your tone, Ms. Jones.

27
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:25,837
But tonight, I suppose
you'll finally be useful.

28
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:30,009
I need you to keep my niece entertained
while I do artifact inventory.

29
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,380
Apparently, she doesn't find
spreadsheets exciting.

30
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:34,968
[scoffs] Youths.

31
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,223
-Hey.
-So, you're a Peabody.

32
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:40,725
Penelope Presley Peabody.
But you can call me Penny.

33
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,269
Nice to meet you.

34
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:47,112
Ridley Jones, protector--
I mean, resident, of the museum.

35
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,360
Oh, I know.
My uncle's told me tons about you.

36
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,993
I think it's so cool you live here.
[gasps]

37
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:55,281
Is that a real lasso?

38
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:56,945
Uh, yeah, it is.

39
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:59,583
Wow! Have you ever used it?

40
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:00,751
Once or twice.

41
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,079
That is awesome!

42
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:05,748
If you think that's awesome,

43
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:10,094
you're gonna love what else we got
in the museum. Come on, I'll show you.

44
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:14,715
Okay, team, let's run through
our party planning checklist.

45
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,261
Uh, balloons and banners are a go.

46
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:22,429
Party supplies are handled.
Tonight, everyone has horns.

47
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:25,767
-[chuckles]
-Party horns, that is. [snorts]

48
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:29,944
And I got the super-important map
you told me not to lose right here.

49
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,031
[gasps] Uh…

50
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,110
Huh. I mean, now it's right here.

51
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:36,485
-Thanks, Ralph.
-Mummazing.

52
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,413
That leaves Dudley.

53
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,741
Do you have tissues for when you start

54
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:41,737
crying?

55
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:46,168
I can't believe it's our little Ridley's
100th adventure already.

56
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,459
They grow up so fast.

57
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,093
Listen up, everyone.

58
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,432
I planned Ridley's surprise party
to perfection,

59
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,638
so there will be no surprises tonight.

60
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,640
Except for, you know, the surprise.
[chuckles]

61
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:02,643
Got it?

62
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,434
-Totes.
-No surprises.

63
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,557
And this is our butterfly display.

64
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:10,984
-Aw. Look at their cute little wings.
-Don't. They're ticklish.

65
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:14,895
I mean, uh,
we're not supposed to touch the exhibits.

66
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,486
-Oh sorry. Oopsies.
-[giggles]

67
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:18,742
Did you hear that?

68
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:23,583
Uh, no. Anyway, come on.
You're gonna love the Egyptian wing.

69
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:27,832
Let me just look to make sure
it's clean before we go in.

70
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,835
Surprise!

71
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,799
Happy 100th adventure, Sunshine!

72
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:39,430
For the big one hundo,
we're going on a radical treasure hunt.

73
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,220
-[laughing]
-[gasps]

74
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,175
They're alive?

75
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,886
"Alive"? What?

76
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:51,266
No, these are museum animatronics.

77
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,690
[making electronic sounds]

78
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,486
Oh, uh, same.

79
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:00,319
I'm totes a robo dino. [grunts]

80
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,816
Ouchie ka-wow-ie!

81
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,828
That's no robot.

82
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,660
Okay, yes, they're alive.
But it's a really important secret.

83
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,577
They're my friends,
and I have to keep them safe.

84
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,337
Will you pretty please not tell anyone?

85
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:16,423
Well, well, well.

86
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,216
Wait till Uncle Peabody hears about this.

87
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,720
He knew something
was up with this museum.

88
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:24,853
Good thing he sent
his favorite niece to go fishing.

89
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,561
-Not cool, dude.
-[all gasp]

90
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,061
You tricked me.

91
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:32,062
I thought you were different,
but you're just like Mr. Peabody.

92
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:37,146
Don't take it personally. My uncle always
says it's every Peabody for themself.

93
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:40,405
He'll be so proud
when I report back with this dirt.

94
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:44,078
A museum that's alive?
Now that's interesting.

95
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:48,658
Please, please don't tell him, Penny.
We'll give you anything you want.

96
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:50,536
Anything?

97
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:54,423
Okay, then. I won't tell him,
on one condition:

98
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:57,092
I want that treasure.

99
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,051
[gasps]

100
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,051
[sighs]

101
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:03,176
[groans]
I can't believe you agreed to this.

102
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:07,141
She can't be trusted. She's a… Peabody.

103
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:11,193
I know, but we have to save the museum.
This is our only option.

104
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:14,229
Sometimes a commander's
got to make tough calls.

105
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,154
-You're doing the right thing.
-I really hope so.

106
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:21,243
This museum is way too special
to let the Peabodys ruin it.

107
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,371
[butterflies giggling]

108
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,577
[whale] Oh, yeah.

109
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:34,130
It feels so good
to shake my tail after a long day.

110
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,590
Whoa.

111
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:42,434
If my treasure map-reading skills
are as bodacious as my tail,

112
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,348
I'm pretty sure we go… hm, hm, hm,

113
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,638
down there.

114
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:50,981
-Ugh.
-But my couture wraps are dry-clean only.

115
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,019
[laughs]

116
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,901
Oh, I thought that was a joke.

117
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:56,358
I don't joke about couture.

118
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,109
Okay, team, let's go find that treasure.

119
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,645
[grunting]

120
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,367
-Do you need help, Penny?
-Me? No.

121
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:09,158
Never. A Peabody can figure out
anything on their own.

122
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:10,083
[grunting]

123
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:13,121
Okay, well, see you at the bottom.

124
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:18,586
Why couldn't our 100th adventure
be somewhere warm and cozy and safe?

125
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:22,379
Like a tropical beach
with fruity drinks and tiny umbrellas.

126
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,835
Don't worry, Dudley.

127
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,965
Just stay calm
and we'll touch down in no time.

128
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,763
It's so dark down here,
I can't see my hooves.

129
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:33,057
Here, Fred. Let me.
I've been known to light up a room.

130
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:36,272
My hooves! Thanks, Princess.

131
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,444
[grunts, screams]

132
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:40,899
Whoa!

133
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,493
Penny, are you okay?

134
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,448
That was awesome!

135
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:48,571
[clears throat]
I mean, awesomely dangerous.

136
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:52,828
My uncle would shut this place down
immediately if he knew about it.

137
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:56,212
I wish I didn't know about it.
This place is terrifying.

138
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,790
We've been on 99 other adventures.

139
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:01,666
As long as we're together, we've got this.

140
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,594
-Dante, lead the way.
-Sure thing, dudette.

141
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,844
Let's kick it.

142
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:09,144
So, you're an astronaut?

143
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:13,100
You betcha. First monkey to slip
on a banana peel in space.

144
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,982
No monkeying around with the enemy,
Peaches.

145
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,190
Mind your own beeswax, pigeon.

146
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,321
Ah! I'm a dodo bird, for your information.

147
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,479
And I'm the last of my kind.

148
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:27,238
This museum is the only home I have left.
[whimpers]

149
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:28,571
Is that true?

150
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:31,866
We're all family here.
The museum's our home.

151
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,752
Oh, I didn't know that.

152
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,789
Yo, I think we're almost there.

153
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,043
Wonder what these spiky things are?

154
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:45,342
Oh, got it.
Super pointy death traps. Gnarly.

155
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:46,553
Hoof it or lose it!

156
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,092
-Go!
-Run!

157
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:51,925
[shudders]

158
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:53,970
-Whoa!
-Ridley!

159
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,599
Gotcha.

160
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:59,227
Penny, come on. It's not safe.

161
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,232
[panting]

162
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,936
Oh! She's not gonna make it!

163
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,105
I can't look!

164
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,403
Slide, Penny!

165
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,068
[grunts]

166
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,334
-Bisonic stampeding.
-That was close.

167
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:15,948
I can't believe I just did that.
Coolest moment of my life.

168
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:17,711
Whoa.

169
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,496
Dude, we did it.

170
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,462
Even holding the map
upside down the whole time.

171
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,340
Wait, don't touch.

172
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:30,013
With this, my uncle will finally be able

173
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:32,972
to take over the museum
and sell everything.

174
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,144
What?

175
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:37,022
I told you a Peabody couldn't be trusted.

176
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:40,309
Every artifact.
Every painting. All of you.

177
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,693
[Ridley] No!
-[screams]

178
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:47,323
-[grunts] Mummazing catch.
-Bisonic move.

179
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,401
[grunts, screams]

180
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:50,396
[grunts] I got you, Penny.

181
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,815
Oh no, it's slipping.

182
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,407
Come on, grab the rope.

183
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:57,332
But she's going to help
her uncle sell our home.

184
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:58,961
That doesn't matter now.

185
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:02,828
It's my job to protect everything
and everybody in this museum,

186
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,417
including Penny.

187
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,212
It's the right thing to do.

188
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,462
-Totally.
-Hang in there!

189
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,588
[all grunting]

190
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,554
Stay calm, Penny. We got you.

191
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,644
It's not enough.

192
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,219
Even with my bison strength.

193
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,345
Dudley, we need you.

194
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:21,482
[Penny] Please, Dudley, I need you.

195
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,651
[whimpers] Okay.

196
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,649
[all grunting]

197
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,281
-Ah!
-[Ridley] Got you.

198
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,068
I can't believe you saved me.

199
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:32,491
That's what we do.
We look out for each other.

200
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:36,662
Yeah, I noticed that. This place isn't
at all what I thought it was.

201
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:40,962
You've made me realize I was wrong
about a lot of things, actually.

And don't worry,
I won't tell my uncle anything.

221
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,694
Your secret is safe with me. I promise.

222
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,276
-How queenly of you.
-Yes!

223
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,821
Thank you, Penny.

224
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,114
Here. A deal's a deal.

225
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:00,618
No. That treasure belongs here,
where it'll be protected.

226
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,331
Under one condition.

227
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:03,411
[all] Huh?

228
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,246
Can I come hang out
with you guys sometime?

229
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,542
Absolutely.

230
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,035
-You bet.
-Yeah.

231
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,046
Turns out I kind of like you.

232
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:15,718
I guess I can make an exception
to my never-trust-a-Peabody rule. [laughs]

233
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:20,010
I couldn't think of a better way
to celebrate my 100th.

234
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:24,056
We worked as a team, found
a hidden treasure, and made a new friend.

235
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:27,691
I couldn't think of a better way
to celebrate my first.

236
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:32,360
I fell down a well, ran through
a booby-trapped cave, made 6 new friends.

237
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:34,651
-[Peabody] Niece?
-Mr. Peabody! Hide!

238
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:39,566
Ah, there you are. You missed out
on a lively night of counting.

239
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:40,527
[chuckles]

240
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:43,946
I'm sure. Come on.
I think it's time for us to go home.

241
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,906
So? What did you find out?

242
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,416
Sorry, Uncle. There's nothing to report.

243
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:51,339
This is just a regular, boring old museum.

244
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:57,337
-I'm ready for my 100th stamp.
-[Mama] I'm so proud of you, sweetie.

245
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:01,005
And for your 100th mission,
you don't just get a stamp.

246
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:04,635
Now that you're a stronger protector,
you're ready for…

247
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,734
Wow. What does it do?

248
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:10,809
This is a Hero's Hand.
Every skilled protector has one.

249
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:15,526
There are tools inside it that'll
help you get through all kinds of jams.

250
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:16,819
I want to try.

251
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,072
Whoa! [chuckles]

252
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:20,737
Thanks, Mama.

253
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,783
I promise to use
the Hero's Hand with pride.

254
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,448
Now let's try this one.

255
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,287
-Whoa!
-[laughs]

256
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,669
