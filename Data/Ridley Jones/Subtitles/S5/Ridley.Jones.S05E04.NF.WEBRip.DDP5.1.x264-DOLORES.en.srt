Get them before they get away.

177
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,753
Come back here, you egg-swiping varmint.

178
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,214
[screeches]

179
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,634
-[screeches]
-[grunts]

180
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:10,762
This would be a lovely time
for me to learn how to fly.

181
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,341
[grunting]

182
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:13,256
[whimpers]

183
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,136
[grunts]

184
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,217
-Whoa!
-[hisses]

185
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,427
Whoa, girl. Whoa.

186
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:21,938
Whoo-hoo!

187
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,149
Ride 'em, Ridley!

188
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,480
Whoa! [grunts]

189
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:29,235
That dino bucks like a bronco.
How are your vitals, Ridley?

190
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,738
I'm fine, but they're getting away.

191
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:35,871
Those raptors messed
with the wrong dino dudely-dude.

192
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,739
[hissing]

193
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,042
Ah!

194
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,212
Come back!

195
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,328
Whoo!

196
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:50,717
[grunts]

197
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:56,256
I bet this looks so cool.

198
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:00,058
Oh yeah. [laughs]

199
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,391
[gasps] Oh no. Whoa!

200
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,649
Oh! Bogus.

201
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,149
Double bogus.

202
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,570
[roar]

203
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,534
-Oh no!
-Dante's trapped.

204
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,950
Oh, shooting stars.

205
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,199
[hissing]

206
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,701
Just like so many problems in life,

207
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,703
the solution is bowling.

208
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,745
I'm gonna need to, like, bowl a strike.

209
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:27,880
[gasps] Do it for little Stegman,
the dino dudely-dude inside this egg.

210
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,134
He egged a strike.

211
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,085
-All right!
-Gotcha.

212
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,386
[screeches]

213
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:40,385
Dante, you were amazing.

214
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,983
-The dino dudely-dude abides.
-[chuckles]

215
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,100
Come on.

216
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:50,646
Oh, my little Stegman is safe again.
Megalosuper thanks.

217
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,283
I'm just happy knowing
that these eggs

218
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:57,201
are back in the nest where
they'll be totally loved and cared for.

219
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,695
And not a mule tail too soon.

220
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,874
Them critters are making to hatch.

221
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:04,792
-[squeaking]
-[all] Aw!

222
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,712
They're cuter than dimples on a donkey.

223
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,632
[gurgles]

224
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,710
Could I… Could I hold Stegman?

225
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,166
Of course you can.

226
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,965
Hey there, little dino dudely-dude.

227
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,840
Little stegosaurs,

228
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:21,387
say hello to your Jurassick Uncle Dante.

229
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:24,812
-[all] Uncle Dante! Uncle Dante!
-Whoa!

230
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:28,652
Sun's going down. We should
probably get back to the museum.

231
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:29,729
Probably.

232
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:33,904
But I think we can let Uncle Dante
enjoy this a little longer.

233
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,454
Hey, watch your little spikes. Ow!

234
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:37,946
[laughs]

235
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:43,870
I reckon we'll need a stellar
final bowl if we're gonna win it.

236
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:44,913
Don't sweat it.

237
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:48,535
Now that I know those dudely-dudes
are loved and cared for,

238
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:51,544
I'm in my perfect bowl space.

239
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:56,842
[laughs] We did it!
We won the coveted Golden Banana!

240
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:59,554
[chanting] Dante! Dante! Dante!

241
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:02,255
Dino-dudely banana bowler,

242
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:09,226
I, Queen Ismat, am honored to present you
with the coveted Golden Banana.

243
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,654
Dante? Where'd he go now?

244
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:16,242
What could be more important
than the coveted Golden Banana?

245
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,319
Thanks, little dino dudely-dudes.

246
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:23,275
You gave me the inner peace
to banana bowl the perfect strike.

247
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,704
You make your Uncle Dante proud.

248
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,627
