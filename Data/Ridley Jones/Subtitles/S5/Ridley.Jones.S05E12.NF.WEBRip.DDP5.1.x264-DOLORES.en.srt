[Ridley] Peaches' Space Race.

24
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,664
Another stamp, Ridley.

25
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:18,701
You had to be extra brave
to find Pedro's lost toy in that volcano.

26
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:21,367
Mr. Fish is safe and sound.

27
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,996
Well, that's not the only exciting news.

28
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,344
Your grandma here called in some favors,

29
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:30,419
and a new exhibit
is coming to our museum today.

30
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,547
-No way!
-Yes way.

31
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:35,554
And let's just say it's out of this world.

32
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,507
[gasps] Is it the Zenith exhibit?

33
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,267
The very one.

34
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:42,059
It's got artifacts
from the real space mission.

35
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:44,983
Even the Zenith shuttle itself.

36
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,193
Wow! Ooh, I gotta go tell Peaches.

37
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:51,066
Peaches, we've got a surprise for you.

38
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:54,822
What a kettle of mules.
I got a surprise for y'all too.

39
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:57,366
Oh, oh, a stack of banana sandwiches?

40
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,370
Better.

41
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,741
Better than sandwiches?

42
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:02,955
Whoa, is that a comet?

43
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,419
Ooh, let me see.

44
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:07,459
Stellar, ain't it?
That there's the Jemison Comet.

45
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,554
It only orbits Earth every few years,

46
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:13,879
but when you catch it,
ah, it's a sight for sore eyes.

47
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,717
-So you've seen it before?
-Sure have.

48
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,143
I was just a tiny little chimp then,

49
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:22,732
and seeing that comet
streaking across the cosmos,

50
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,269
it made me want to be an astronaut.

51
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:29,073
Folks think space exploration
is all about the destination,

52
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,439
but getting to the moon don't mean a thing

53
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:34,816
if you can't appreciate
the beauty all around you.

54
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:37,124
Oh, speaking of space exploration…

55
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,488
Oh, yeah. Peaches, guess what.

56
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:43,996
The Zenith exhibit is here,
with the real shuttle and everything.

57
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,500
Zenith. Mm.
That means she's gonna be here.

58
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:48,956
Who?

59
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,093
Cookie.

60
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,379
[Cookie] Alrighty,
keep the planetary samples together

61
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:57,804
and let's get our girl Zenith notched up
to a 60-degree angle. [chuckles]

62
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,636
That's where she shines.

63
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,470
She commands such respect.

64
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,426
Don't she know it.

65
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,807
Do you know her?

66
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,444
All too well.

67
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,190
Cookie was my rival in astronaut training.

68
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:14,033
No matter how hard I worked,
she'd beat all the records.

69
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,110
And when it was time
to recruit a chimp for the Zenith mission,

70
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,567
guess who got to go.

71
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,736
Was it you?

72
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,200
It was not you. Got it. Right.

73
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:27,036
That must have been hard,
but you are not in training anymore.

74
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,833
Maybe you two could be friends.

75
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:32,377
Ha! That's as likely
as a snake stubbing their toe.

76
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,222
Cookie really knows
how to shrimp my grits.

77
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,468
Peaches? Is that you, girl?

78
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,350
Look at this.
The dream team back together.

79
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:44,179
Oh, I've been hoping
I'd get to see your museum,

80
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:47,435
but it's been wild
touring all over the world.

81
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:51,938
Let me tell you something, Junior.
Royals? They love space.

82
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,983
I told you not to call me Junior.

83
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,488
It's nice to meet you, Cookie. I'm Ridley.

84
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,120
Peaches has told us,
uh, so much about you.

85
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,869
Oh, well, if I know Peaches,
I bet it's still shrimpin' her grits

86
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,833
that I beat all her records.

87
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:10,293
Oh yeah? Well, I'd like
to see you try and beat me now.

88
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,745
Is that a challenge?

89
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:14,344
'Cause you know
how much I like a challenge.

90
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,630
You bet your banana it is.

91
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:19,264
How about we race to Jemison's Comet.

92
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:23,512
First chimp to pitch their flag
on the highest point wins.

93
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:24,716
Like, wins what?

94
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,176
[both] Glory.

95
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,063
A space race sounds fun,

96
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:31,152
but, um,
I don't exactly have a crew on hand.

97
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,109
Uh-uh.

98
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:35,358
You're not backing out that easy.
You can borrow some of mine.

99
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,781
A space race? I am so in.

100
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,490
Then you're hired, cadet.

101
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,780
All right then.
Ridley and Dante, you're with Cookie.

102
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:45,235
Fred, Ismat and Dudley'll ride with me.

103
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:46,576
-Dino-mite.
-Count me in.

104
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:49,331
-Amazing!
-I can't wait to see space again.

105
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:54,674
And I can't wait to see
the look on Cookie's face when I beat her.

106
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,800
-Three…
-Two…

107
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,920
[both] …one, blastoff!

108
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,766
We're ahead.
Eat my space particles, Cookie.

109
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:14,861
Can we do a quick loop around Earth?
I want to see the pyramids from space.

110
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:19,069
We don't have time for sightseeing.
We've got a Cookie to crumble.

111
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:24,070
I can't believe
I'm in the real Zenith shuttle.

112
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,487
Believe it. You haven't even
seen what this baby can do.

113
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,999
-[Ridley] Whoo-hoo!
-[Cookie] Whoa!

114
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,959
[laughing]

115
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,380
Got any snacks in here, Captain Cookie?

116
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:37,589
Wouldn't be a space tour without 'em.
Here, catch.

117
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:43,934
I'll just slow this ship down
a little so you can float away.

118
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:47,102
Oh, Ridley. You gotta see this.

119
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,260
Whoa.

120
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,518
Mind blown.

121
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:54,476
Hey, check it out. There's Taurus.

122
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:57,522
That's a bull, you know.
Practically family.

123
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,897
Oh. Any dodo constellations?

124
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,244
Quit wiggling, Dudley.

125
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,739
In fact, no one move.
It affects our speed.

126
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:05,822
Huh. Sorry.

127
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:09,947
[Peaches] I think I see a shortcut
round the dark side of the moon.

128
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,906
[all groan]

129
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:16,496
Any chance we can get a better view
of the moon, or literally anything?

130
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:17,844
Almost there.

131
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:30,807
Boom! First to the comet.
Now let's go plant our flag.

132
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,060
-Oh, I'm gonna need a minute.
-Whoa.

133
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:35,192
I got the dodo dizzies.

134
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:38,609
No time. Cookie is right behind us.

135
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,107
Did you see that nebula?

136
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,574
I didn't even know that color existed.

137
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:50,242
No. We saw space, as in the empty part.

138
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,076
[sighs] What a ride.

139
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:54,041
Just like our days back in training, huh?

140
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,422
Oh, I get it.

141
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:58,328
"Back in training,"
where you always beat me.

142
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,878
Well, not today, Cookie.

143
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,512
Can't have you
falling behind and wasting time.

144
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,759
And I thought queens were bossy.

145
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:09,302
Wow. I can't believe
we're this close to the comet.

146
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,597
It's like a whole other world.

147
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,141
Even I've never walked on a comet before.

148
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,515
It's not what I expected at all.

149
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,272
Let's gather samples.

150
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:21,694
If you're trying to distract me,
it ain't gonna work.

151
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,324
I'm headed for the finish line.

152
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,402
Oh, catch up with you later then, Junior.

153
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:30,737
You will not. And don't call me Junior!

154
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:33,365
Ridley, you want to assist me?

155
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,083
Like a real astronaut? Yes, please.

156
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:41,674
[groans] As queen,
I demand to be with the fun team.

157
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:45,922
I hate to say it,
but I agree with the princess.

158
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:49,297
Y'all, this is a race, not a field trip.

159
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:50,845
-Come on, Dudley.
-[gasps]

160
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,468
[Peaches] We're winning this.

161
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,389
Ah, this is more like it.

162
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,435
Peaches was really
taking the fun out of space.

163
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:02,149
Being up here
is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

164
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,611
I hope she's having some fun.

165
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:08,452
No, all she cares about
is planting her flag.

166
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:12,119
[gasps] Peaches can't plant her flag.
It'd be a disaster.

167
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,580
Captain Cookie dude,
there's nothing wrong with losing.

168
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:19,251
No, a disaster for her.
Look what's below all this dust.

169
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,252
The comet is held together by ice.

170
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,844
But this close to the sun,
it's melting, and fast.

171
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,801
So if Peaches plants a flag…

172
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,262
The ground will crack
under her and Dudley.

173
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,683
We've gotta warn them.

174
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:39,848
That Cookie thinks
she's the monkey's bananas.

175
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,556
-But today is Peaches' day.
-[panting]

176
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:43,647
Hooray!

177
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,271
[both panting]

178
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,148
This is one small step for chimp kind

179
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:52,106
and one giant leap
for me proving that I'm the best.

180
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,788
I'm nobody's Junior. I win!

181
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:56,908
[both scream]

182
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:59,584
[grunts] This doesn't feel like winning.

183
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,834
Help! Dodo down! Dodo down!

184
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,417
-[Ridley] Oh no.
-Dudes!

185
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:05,502
Dudley.

186
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,206
[Dudley grunts] Save us!

187
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,546
Well, Junior, looks like you won.

188
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,552
Aw! Pickles in a jam jar.

189
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:17,515
I thought finally beating you
would feel great, but it just feels…

190
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,728
-Sticky?
-We'll get you out of there.

191
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,269
Dudely. Grab on to Ralph.

192
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,853
[grunting]

193
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,105
[grunts] Thank beakness.

194
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,445
Come on, just let me help you.

195
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,660
[grunting]

196
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,696
All right.

197
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:38,872
[grunts]

198
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:44,458
What? You just assumed
old Junior here would need saving?

199
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:48,172
Nah, astronauts never assume.
They research.

200
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,924
Wait, you were actually doing tests?

201
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:54,297
I thought you were trying
to distract me so you could get ahead.

202
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,795
You kidding?
How could I worry about the finish line?

203
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:59,307
I just landed
on a comet for the first time.

204
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:03,940

Thanks for reminding me
what really matters, Cookie.

225
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,471
I got so carried away with winning.

226
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:24,766
I didn't even stop to think that…

227
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,060
I'm dancing on Jemison's Comet!

228
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:31,114
I wonder what tiny little Peaches
would think of this.

229
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,994
I think she'd want to enjoy it.

230
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,371
How about we take the long way down.

231
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,908
We've got some sightseeing to do.

232
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:44,872
[cheering and laughing]

233
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,173
Wow.

234
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:00,761
So, uh, congrats on your win, Ju--
I mean, champ.

235
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,965
First to the top of the Jemison.

236
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,925
Finally, a record you can't beat.

237
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:08,555
[laughs] I'm glad you're always
nipping at my heels.

238
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:11,154
You drive me to be a better astronaut.

239
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,190
Aw.

240
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,113
You know what?

241
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:16,070
Watching you
inspires me to be better too.

242
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,283
Race you back to the museum?

243
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:21,533
[chuckles] Oh, you are on.

244
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,325
Last one there's a rotten banana.
