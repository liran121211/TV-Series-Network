[Ridley] Flight School Dropout.

24
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,497
-[Ridley] You got this!
-[cheering]

25
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:29,213
-[cheering]
-[Dante] Whoa!

26
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,217
Splendid form, Perry.

27
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:35,009
And now our final flier: Dudley.

28
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,635
Thanks, everyone.

29
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:40,561
I hope you're floored by my routine.
[chuckles]

30
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:43,732
Get it? 'Cause I'm on the floor.
[chuckles]

31
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,862
'Cause I can't fly yet.

32
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:49,479
But I've always wanted
to be in a flying recital.

33
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,067
So, well… [squeaks]

34
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,821
Dudley? Are you feeling okay?

35
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:57,575
I'm feeling like a dodo
about to embarrass himself.

36
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,119
I can't fly like Perry.

37
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,702
But you can perform like Dudley.

38
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,998
Trust me, you can do this.

39
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:08,132
You've practiced and practiced,
and now you just got to go for it.

40
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:11,801
Thanks, Ridley. Okay. Here goes.

41
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,971
And one and two and, uh, hi, hi.

42
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:17,051
Whoo and whee!

43
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,507
Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh!

44
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,136
Love a routine with flair.

45
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,433
Hip. Hi!

46
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,687
[laughs]

47
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,398
Ah!

51
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:33,822
Uh-oh.

52
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,698
The Wall of Wind.

53
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:42,541
Oh, remember, hon.
Don't fight the wind. Waltz with it.

54
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,210
Yes. Now ride the breeze.

55
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,630
[shudders] Waltz with the wind.

56
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:48,789
[chuckles]

57
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,299
Ha!

58
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:51,298
Whee!

59
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:53,594
Whoo-hoo!

60
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,683
-Amazing!
-Go, Dudley!

61
00:02:56,885 --> 00:03:01,135
You like the twirls? Really?
Even though I didn't technically…

62
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:02,972
Fly? Oh, you bet.

63
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:05,637
[snorts] I might add
a twirl to my next stampede.

64
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,597
-[bird] Incoming!
-Hey!

65
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:08,727
[laughs]

66
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,030
Whoa! [grunts]

67
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,938
Brace for impact!

68
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,737
-[Dudley] Ah!
-[all scream]

69
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,700
[laughs]
Hey, it's the dodo with the dance moves.

70
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:21,162
-I'm Stella.
-Hi.

71
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:22,582
Are you two okay?

72
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,250
Ah, sure. You can't fly like the wind

73
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,290
without bonking
off a few walls, right, Dodo?

74
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,125
-Uh…
-Your speed is incredible,

75
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,631
but your landings
are a little on the messy side.

76
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,764
Oh, guess so.

77
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:39,301
Oh, this ruby has a crack.

78
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:43,175
Mr. Peabody
is not gonna be stoked if he notices.

79
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,974
Oh, I have an idea.

80
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,268
You all know
about the Vermilion Star, right?

81
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,392
Nope.

82
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,058
Hm. Might be a royalty thing.

83
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:54,436
Anyhoo, it's a giant ruby that was lost
in the Arctic a gazillion dynasties ago.

84
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:58,445
If we find it and bring it to the museum,
Peabody won't notice anything else.

85
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,949
Got to say, that just might work.

86
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,452
Ismat, let's make a plan.

87
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:06,373
Everyone else,
get ready for an Arctic ruby rescue.

88
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:10,294
If getting ready means
worrying about frostbite, I'm on it.

89
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,335
Oh! Hear me out.

90
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,258
You can skip worrying
and come be my wingman.

91
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,548
[grunts]

92
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:20,303
[chuckles] You want to hang out with me?

93
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,925
Sure, she does, Dudley.

94
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:26,561
You are the chillest bird around.
Just go for it, remember? Have fun.

95
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,561
See? I knew you were cool.

96
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,903
Oh, Ridley was just being nice.

97
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:35,149
I'm as cool as a fleece-lined sweater
with a heater inside.

98
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:40,153
[gasps] But maybe if I practiced.
Say, do you give coolness lessons?

99
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:44,988
Sure. Lesson number one:
lessons aren't cool.

100
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:47,996

00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:15,543
Is that Dudely? [chuckles]

129
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,955
Love the new look.

130
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,423
But you'll need a warmer coat.

131
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:22,424
[panting] Bad news, team.

132
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:25,127
Cameras are showing
a storm brewing in the Arctic.

133
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,218
Oh no!

134
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:30,602
Well, it's not worth risking
life and wing, or hoof and tail.

135
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,601
We better wait for the storm to pass.

136
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:35,653
Oh, rescue rain check. Bummer.

137
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:39,938
Cheer up, Eyes.
The time will fly by if we spend it

138
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,025
sledding in the tundra exhibit.

139
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,150
-Yes!
-I mean, we are dressed for snow.

140
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,607
[all exclaim]

141
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:51,285
Oh, I wanted to show everyone
how cool I could be on a mission.

142
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:55,499
Yo, Dodo, you heading out
to find that Ruby? Sounds fun.

143
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,421
Hey, hey, hey! Hold on!

144
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,840
Peaches just warned us
there's a dangerous storm coming.

145
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,800
Oh, Dodo, the whole point of being cool

146
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:07,051
is you don't listen to warnings
if they ruin the fun.

147
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,135
You want to have fun, don't you?

148
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,180
Why, I believe I, uh, dodo-do.

149
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:14,434
Fun, right?

150
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,727
Who needs warnings
and training and mittens?

151
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,152
Oops, forgot my mittens.

152
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,610
Ooh, but still, this is cool.

153
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,821
Also, very cold.
But more importantly, cool.

154
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:27,662
The faster you go, the warmer you'll get.

155
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:31,158
-Ah! Oh!
-Whoa!

156
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,042
[grunts]

157
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:37,289
Hey, I just stumbled
beak over tail feathers, and I feel great.

158
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:41,173
[laughs] Told you.
Leap before you look, I always say.

159
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,762
Hm. Leap before you look. Got it.

160
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,045
[Stella] Whee!

161
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,144
[laughing]

162
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,721
[Stella] Whee!

163
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:57,772
Oh, check it.

164
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,942
Ooh! The Vermilion Star. It's so big.

165
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,361
[grunts]

166
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:07,111
Mr. Peabody will be distracted for months.

167
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,525
I can't wait to show Ridley.

168
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:13,453
I think I'm finally getting
the hang of that sledding business.

169
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:18,624
Ridley! Dudley didn't show up
for his six o'clock wing stretches.

170
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,416
It's un-bird of.

171
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,840
That doesn't sound like Dudely.
Where do you think he is?

172
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,130
Well, the last time we saw him was right
before the mission at the Arctic exhibit.

173
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:31,756
[gasps] Oh no!
I bet he went after the ruby on his own.

174
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,184
I kept telling him to just go for it.

175
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:37,483
I didn't mean
just go into a giant blizzard.

176
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:40,098
We got to find him
before the storm hits.

177
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,016
Come on.

178
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,480
No need to panic. Totally cool.

179
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,856
We'll just leap before we look. [chuckles]

180
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,914
'Cause we can't see
anything anyway, right?

181
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,487
[squeals]

182
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:53,453
[grunts]

183
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,873
-Nice and slow.
-What?

184
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,952
I said we should go slow!

185
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,617
Yeah, this is too slow.

186
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,916
No! Wait!

187
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,499
We'll be home in no time, Dodo!

188
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:06,998
Whoa!

189
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,508
Oh, feathers.

190
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,009
Whoa! [grunts]

191
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,971
[wind howling]

192
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:15,601
Stella!

193
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,977
Oh, Stella, you're alive.

194
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,348
Come on out. Get out of the snow.

195
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:23,055
I can't. Uh…

196
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,938
My wings are frozen stiff.

197
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,032
Uh, I'm on my way.

198
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:33,322
[grunts] I just need to leap before I--

199
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,116
Ah! Ah! [shivers]

200
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,199
Leap before I-- [grunts]

201
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,405
It's like the Wall of Wind,

202
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:43,705
but bigger and colder
and impossible to get through.

203
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,501
I shouldn't have flown in here.

204
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,165
Now I can't fly us out.

205
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,883
[grunts] Hey, I flew in here too,

206
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,134
in a walking kind of way.

207
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,926
[sighs] If only Ridley knew we were here.

208
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,811
-[Peaches] Give a holler, Sunshine!
-[Ridley] Can you hear us?

209
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:01,178
We've got a lot of ground to cover.
We should spread out.

210
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,887
Leaping lunar modules.

211
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,807
This is like wandering
through a cloud of stardust.

212
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,316
I could barely see you.

213
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,898
Good point, Peaches.
We could lose each other.

214
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,324
Stay close, everyone.

215
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:15,412
Oh, I wish we could let
our Dodo bro know we're out here.

216
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:16,869
Wait. We can.

217
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:20,909
We can't see Dudley,
but maybe Dudley can see this.

218
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:27,918
The last thing I'll ever see
before I turn into a Popsicle.

219
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,002
[sobs]

220
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,836
A signal flare.

221
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,841
Ay! A signal flare?

222
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:34,884
It's Ridley!

223
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,087
Stella, the Eyes are coming,

224
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,638
and if they can fight
through a blizzard to save me,

225
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:42,682
I can waltz with the wind to save you.

226
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:46,267
Yeah, I hear you, wind,
and I have just one question.

227
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,234
May I have this dance?

228
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,904
Uh…

229
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,942
[humming]

230
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,530
Gotcha! [grunts]

231
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:55,782
Dodo!

232
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,743
We're almost there, Stella.
Waltz with me. Hm?

233
00:10:58,824 --> 00:10:59,914
[humming]

234
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:03,162
Oh! There they are.
You can fly straight to them.

235
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,865
But how? My wings don't work.

236
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,326
Sure, they do.

237
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:11,626
See, a very cool eagle
once taught me, "Ride the breeze."

238
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,302
[both] Whoo-hoo!

239
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,221
[both laugh]

240
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:19,849
Hey, look at us! We're flying! Uh…

241
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:23,139
Poor Dudley. He must be so scared.

242
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:27,941
Maybe aim for that sparkly
and oddly fashion-forward cloud.

243
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,480
That's no cloud.

244
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:30,693
It's Dudley.

245
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,903
[both screaming]

246
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,321
-[grunts]
-Dudley.

247
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,783
-Ridley, I'm sorry I--
-You're okay.

248
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:41,583
[chuckles] Yeah.
Let's hug it out before I explain.

249
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,750
Well, you did it,
but you almost got lost forever.

250
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:52,843
And that's as close to extinction
as this dodo ever wants to go.

251
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,210
No more leaping before looking for me.

252
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:56,967
That's the way I like it.

253
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,179
We're just glad you're back, Sunshine.

254
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,220
And I'm just glad
you were there to save me.

255
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,564
You're the bravest dodo I know.

256
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,850
[snorts and laughs]

257
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,443
He's the only dodo you know.

258
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,559
[chuckles] But, like, we get it.

259
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:14,476
Well, I'd love to stay and chat,
but I've got a flying lesson to catch.

260
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,277
[laughs] Time to ride the breeze.

261
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,991
Hey, uh, can I come?

262
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,451
I mean, since all the coolest birds
are dodo doing it.

263
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:25,203
Abso-dodo-lutely.

264
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,286
[all laugh]

265
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,750
[Fred] Oh, Dudley.

266
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,627
[theme music plays]
