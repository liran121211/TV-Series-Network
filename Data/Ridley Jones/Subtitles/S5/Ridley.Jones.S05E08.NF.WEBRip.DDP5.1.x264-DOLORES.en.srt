[Ridley] Happy Herd Day.

23
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,658
[humming]

24
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,700
Hey there.

25
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,413
Happy Herd Day, Fred.

26
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,753
Oh, a special banner just for me?

27
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:23,329
We wanted to show you
how much we love you on your big day.

28
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:27,166
We're all here for you, dude.
Speaking of dude, where's Dudely?

29
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,713
[groans] Sorry I'm late.

30
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:32,257
I couldn't decide which tie screams
"Herd Day!"

31
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:35,802
Also, what exactly is Herd Day again?

32
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:38,137
Oh, sorry, didn't mean to scream that.

33
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:41,273
It's only the most important day
of a bison's life.

34
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:45,981
It's when you go from being
a baby bison to a full member of the herd.

35
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:50,284
And you do that by leading your herd
for the very first time.

36
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,150
Wow! This is the tie for that.

37
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:57,278
Let's not forget the party
the bison are throwing in Fred's honor.

38
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:02,207
It'll be so fun. My Grandma Dottie
is bringing her world-famous hay cake.

39
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:05,038
Rad. It's not a party without cake.

40
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,785
I can't wait for you to meet my grandma.

41
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:10,257
She's the toughest bison there is.

42
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,378
And I know tough.

43
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:15,635
Grandma always says,
"Lead with your heart."

44
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:18,808
The best way to lead a stampede
is by being yourself.

45
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:21,978
That's true.
And you are the expert at being Fred,

46
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,558
so I know you'll do amazing today.

47
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,194
We'll be by your side
the whole time, Fred.

48
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:30,112
It's gonna be the happiest of Herd Days.

49
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:33,741
-Definitely. Follow me, team.
-[cheering]

50
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:38,487
I can't believe I'll soon be galloping
at the front of my own herd.

51
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,575
Check out this bisonic move.

52
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,251
[Ismat] Wow.

53
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:46,499
I call it
a "triple-hoof double axel herd toss."

54
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,593
-You're one of a kind.
-Impressive.

55
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,628
-[all gasp]
-Oh, let me guess.

56
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:53,512
Is this called a "double axel earthshake"?

57
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,510
I don't think that's Fred.

58
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:58,552
[Dottie] Yoodle-ay-hee-hoo!

59
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:03,345
Whoo-hoo! Hi-yah!

60
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,441
Grandma Dottie!

61
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,320
Come here, my tough little potato kugel.

62
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:12,358
It's been too long, kiddo.

63
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:16,242
That happens when you're leading stampedes
all around the plains.

64
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,071
You're basically famous.

65
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:22,076
Well, I do hold the plains record
for strongest stampede,

66
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,830
longest yodel, and fiercest fur-do.

67
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,753
But this day is about you.

68
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:31,748
Ready to train with your favorite grandma
before the big stampede?

69
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,126
So ready.

70
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,053
My friends
are gonna join for the training too.

71
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:40,182
Hi, nice to meet you, Dottie.
I'm Ridley, and this is the Eyes Team.

72
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:44,391
What a bisonic group of pals
you've got here.

73
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,444
Ooh! I love a bison with style.

74
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:49,518
Oh, this old thing?

75
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:52,734
It means Grandma's a strong bison leader.

76
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,065
So cool.

77
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,440
I can't wait to watch you coach today.

78
00:03:56,527 --> 00:04:01,237
I wouldn't miss it for the world,
and I brought my famous hay cake.

79
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,084
♪ Da, da, da, da ♪

80
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,289
Happy Herd Day, Winnifred.

81
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,200
[gasps]

82
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:09,827
Come on, follow me
to the stampede practice.

83
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:13,626
Uh, I'm confused.
I thought it was your special day, Fred.

84
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:17,221
Me too. Who in the galaxy is Winnifred?

85
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,838
[groans]

86
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,795
Everything okay, Fred?

87
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:25,845
Well, the last time I saw my grandma,
I used a different name and pronouns.

88
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:29,642
That was before I discovered
that "Fred" feels more like me.

89
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:32,147
You're a Fred through and through.

90
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,780
I didn't realize
it was so long since we saw each other.

91
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:38,148
Now Grandma doesn't know I've changed.

92
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:42,946
She still thinks I'm her granddaughter
instead of her grand… Fred.

93
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:45,492
Well, do you feel ready to tell her?

94
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:49,036
I do want to, but maybe not today.

95
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,172
I gotta focus on the stampede.

96
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,919
This is a big day
for me and Grandma Dottie.

97
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:58,302
You do what's best for you, Fred.
Don't forget, we're here for you.

98
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,591
Thanks, Ridley.

99
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,974
-Now, let's pick up the pace.
-[laughs]

100
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,758
[all] Whoa!

101
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:04,885
[whistle blows]

102
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:10,231
A successful stampede
excels at three herd-tastic traits:

103
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,650
strength, agility, and endurance.

104
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,770
-[all grunting]
-Ah!

105
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,026
How about the art of not falling?

106
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,110
[laughs] That too.

107
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:24,485
We'll practice all these skills
before you lead the herd.

108
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,204
First up: strength.

109
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,744
As the leader,

110
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:31,327
you need to be strong
against any testy weather.

111
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:34,134
Now go lead the herd to that tree.

112
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,668
Follow me, everyone.

113
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:42,134
Remember, the best way to lead
is to be yourself.

114
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,966
Be myself.

115
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,222
Uh, yup, got it.

116
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,354
Whoa!

117
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,810
You need a banana?

118
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:53,140
It might be an ice pop now,
but it'll help you be ready for takeoff.

119
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:56,687
No, thanks, Peaches. You got this.

120
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,273
Follow me.

121
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,650
[all] Whoa!

122
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,985
[screaming]

123
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,240
Yes!

124
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,700
[all cheer]

125
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,124
Agility time.

126
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,332
Sometimes in a stampede,

127
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:14,372
you have to change direction
without slowing down.

128
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,497
You're a rock star, Dottie!

129
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,634
[sighs] Focus, Fred.

130
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,959
[grunts]

131
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:24,757
Leaping runs in the family, kid.
You're gonna ace this.

132
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,012
Thanks, Gran.

133
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,184
Go! Go! Go!

134
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,851
-Mummazing!
-You got this!

135
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,561
-Superstar!
-Way to go!

136
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,941
Almost there. You could do it.

137
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:37,268
-Lead with your heart, Winnifred.
-Huh? Whoa!

138
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:43,777
That was a close one. Come on.
Let's move on to the next challenge.

139
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,861
Grandma Dottie… [groans]

140
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,317
Are you okay, Fred?

141
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,697
Before, you were leaping
all over with no problem.

142
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,655
Oh, I guess I'm distracted.

143
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:56,785
I think I would feel better
if I told Grandma Dottie about my name.

144
00:06:56,874 --> 00:07:00,004
We're royally here
for whatever you want to do, Fred.

145
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:04,796
Grandma Dottie seems like one cool bison.
You think it's okay to tell her, right?

146
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:08,472
Yeah. My grandma has an open mind
and a big heart.

147
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,853
Then you should totally dino do it.

148
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:15,440
I think what we're saying, Fred,
is if you're ready, we support you.

149
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:18,978
Thanks. I do want to talk to her. I…

150
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:22,283
Come on, my little herdlings.
Let's move those hooves.

151
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:25,028
…just don't know when the right time is.

152
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:30,028
Endurance is important in a stampede.

153
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:33,286
You got to keep going,
even when things get tough.

154
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,456
Holy smokes.

155
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,538
The frozen banana's
turning into a barbecued banana.

156
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,924
Still good, though.

157
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:44,301
[gasps] I thought I wasn't
gonna have to do anything today.

158
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,470
I didn't dress for physical labor.

159
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,139
Dudley, I'm carrying you.

160
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,388
Yes.

161
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,270
And even just watching you
is making me tired.

162
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,599
[grunts, groans]

163
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:57,894
Um…

164
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,607
-Hm? Time-out.
-[whistle blows]

165
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:04,818
Ms. Jones, could you lead
our happy herd back to the plains, please?

166
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:09,821
-Of course, Coach Dottie.
-Oh, finally. I need a break.

167
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,736
[Ismat] Again, I am the one carrying you.

168
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:19,868
I notice you seem
a little off in your game, my baby babka.

169
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:22,957
-And I think I know what's going on.
-You do?

170
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,424
Yipperee. I'm pushing you too hard.

171
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,835
Oh, no, Grandma Dottie, it's not that.

172
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,965
I love your coaching.

173
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:35,392
It's just, I haven't been feeling… myself.

174
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:39,693
Oh dear, that's the most important part
of leading a herd.

175
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:43,859
I know what might help.
You know how my pin signifies strength?

176
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,360
Well, my grandma gave it to me,

177
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:50,572
and now I'm passing it on
to my granddaughter.

178
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:53,025
Granddaughter? Oh, but…

179
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,623
Grandma Dottie,
there's something I got to tell you.

180
00:08:56,702 --> 00:09:00,412
[man over P.A.] Attention,
Dottie and Fred. Take your positions.

181
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:03,038
Oh, you hear that? It's go time.

182
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:06,795
[groans]

183
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:10,838
Fred, the ceremony's
in T-minus two minutes.

184
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,635
Did you get a chance
to talk to Grandma Dottie?

185
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,679
No. She's so busy with Herd Day…

186
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:17,974
I get that.

187
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:21,687
When my dads need to talk
about a royally important matter,

188
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,439
it can be hard for them
to demand an audience.

189
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:29,442
But I think the reason she's so focused
on Herd Day is that she loves you a lot.

190
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,317
Yeah, that's true.

191
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,744
I feel ready.
I'm gonna go tell Grandma right now.

192
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:39,044
On my Herd Day,
I'm gonna lead the herd as me: Fred.

193
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,660
-Way to go.
-You got this.

194
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:44,792
Oh, there you are.
Are you ready for your big moment?

195
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,835
Almost.
There's something I need to tell you.

196
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,010
Really? But it's time to start.

197
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,179
I know, but this can't wait any longer.

198
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:57,308
If I'm going to lead the herd,
I want to do it as myself.

199
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:00,978
After all, you always say
to lead with your heart, right?

200
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:08,691
Well, my heart says that the way I feel
most myself is to go by the name Fred.

201
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:13,284
That's because I'm non-binary,
and Fred is the name that fits me best.

202
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,492
And I also use they and them,

203
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:20,043
because calling me a she or a he
doesn't feel right to me.

204
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:23,366
Oh. I didn't know that.

205
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,036
No wonder you've been struggling.

206
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:30,045
How could you lead the herd
without being yourself?

207
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:34,259
I'm sorry I used
the wrong name and pronouns.

208
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,552
Thank you for showing me your heart.

209
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:41,465
That's how I know
you'll be the greatest stampede leader.

210
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:43,807
My sweet, tough Fred.

211
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,603
Thanks, Grandma Dottie.

212
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,520
