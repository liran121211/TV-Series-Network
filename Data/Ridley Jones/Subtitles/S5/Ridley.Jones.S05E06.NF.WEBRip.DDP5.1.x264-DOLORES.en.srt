[Mama] Almost.

24
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,791
A little farther.

25
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,198
-There.
-And the hull's intact.

26
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:22,497
Shiver me timbers.
We'll finally have a pirate exhibit.

27
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:23,832
-Hey there.
-Ridley.

28
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:28,457
Ahoy, team. Welcome the Queen Barnacle
aboard to our museum.

29
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:30,216
-So cool.
-Fantastic.

30
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:31,838
Here's the last piece.

31
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:35,215
Secure the wheel when you're ready
for some museum magic.

32
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:38,103
I'm always ready for museum magic.

33
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,021
Thanks for helping me, team.

34
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,520
Our queenly pleasure, Ridley.
You know I love VIP access.

35
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:49,194
Oh, and I've been a mega pirate fan
for, like, 65 million years.

36
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:53,235
You do know pirates have only
been around for 3,000 years, right?

37
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:57,911
Yeah, dates aren't really my thing,
but I can talk like a pirate. Argh!

38
00:01:57,992 --> 00:02:01,542
[chuckles]
That's pretty accurate. Here we go.

39
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,455
Argh!

40
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,753
[all cheer]

41
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:11,206
Ahoy, buccaneers. I'm Captain Finn.

42
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:14,877
And this here's my mighty pirate crew,
Chip and Tootles.

43
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,178
And that is my sword.

44
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:20,812
Welcome to the museum.
I'm Ridley, and this is the Eyes Team.

45
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,060
Hey, there.

46
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,642
I'm a huge fan of your work, pirate dudes.

47
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:29,067
-Totes inspirational.
-Ooh, and I celebrate your work as well.

48
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,359
Thanks for fixing the Queen B for me.

49
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,822
Oh, who put me in this frilly frock?

50
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:34,903
[grunts] Argh!

51
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:35,908
That's better.

52
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,949
I obviously love an outfit change,

53
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:43,253
but dare I say,
I love your fearlessness even more?

54
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:46,749
-Why, thank you, mate.
-Let's give you the grand tour.

55
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,923
Oh no. My hat. I can't do anything
until I find my captain's hat.

56
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:54,974
-We'll help you find it, Captain Finn.
-[Peabody] Argh! Yo-ho-ho.

57
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:57,139
-Museum Mayday!
-Scatter, dudes.

58
00:02:57,218 --> 00:03:00,218
You got to stay still
when Mr. Peabody's around.

59
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:03,265
-What if I don't want to stay quiet?
-Please, Finn?

60
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,809
It's the only way to keep
the museum's secret secret.

61
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,935
Silent as the grave, me hearties.

62
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:12,152
Finally.
Something spectacular in this museum.

63
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:16,073
My mama and grandma sure did
a nice job restoring the ship, huh?

64
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:19,164
Did you know
it is my lifelong dream to be a pirate?

65
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,580
Ah! Oh! [clears throat]

66
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:26,959
Anyone who steals treasure and hoards it
for themself is a bona fide hero to me.

67
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,791
-Argh! Give me back me hat.
-Who said that?

68
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:34,257
Uh, hey, Mr. P,
isn't that the captain's hat?

69
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,419
I am the captain of the museum.

70
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:38,547
But the captain's hat belongs to--

71
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:42,005
The one who's the bravest
most manly man here, of course.

72
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,850
Ooh, look at this manly fellow.

73
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,853
He looks like the ship's leader.

74
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:50,687
And what is this woman doing here?

75
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:53,442
She can't be a part of my dream ship.
Ooh!

76
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:55,994
-I must get her off at once.
-Wait. No.

77
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,569
[panting]

78
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:01,744
-Put her in storage before we open.
-Mr. Peabody, she's the captain--

79
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:05,454
Ms. Jones, do not get in the way
of my favorite exhibit.

80
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:08,326
Not as long
as you value your family's jobs.

81
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,794
Argh! He's erasing me from history.

82
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:15,626
I would say you get used to him,
but you never really do.

83
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:18,883
That scallywag should walk the plank.
Everyone knows

84
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,797
I'm the captain of this vessel.

85
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:24,675
Aye-aye, Captain Finn here
is the fiercest commander to boot.

86
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,774
She sails the toughest seas.

87
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:29,099
Discovers the shiniest treasures.

88
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:33,055
And even gives me ginger ale
when me tummy gets the sea bubbles.

89
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:35,937
Precisely. No one can ignore me.

90
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,065
You know, Finn, you seem rad,

91
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:40,862
but I've seen lots of pictures of pirates,

92
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:44,577
and I've never seen a lady pirate.
Just saying.

93
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,579
Well, you're seeing one now.

94
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:50,621
Well, sure, but, like,
you've never been in my pirate books.

95
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,837
-Hold this, you parrot.
-[stutters] Okay.

96
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,798
That doesn't mean we don't exist.

97
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:57,799
Hear, hear.

98
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,970
What do you reckon we do about Peabody
wanting to put you in storage?

99
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,551
Storage? Argh!

100
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,556
I refuse to have such a fate.

101
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,638
In fact,
I'm starting my own crew somewhere else.

102
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,555
Which way to the nearest shore?

103
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:14,191
Captain Finn, come back.

104
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,524
You forgot this!

105
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:17,727
[pants] Oof!

106
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,647
[grunts] Now I have the sea bubbles!

107
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,114
[Dante] Hey, mighty pirate dudes.

108
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:26,827
How about we brave the waves
and take this out for a spin?

109
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:30,079
Captain Finn's decides
when we venture out to sea.

110
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,753
Though I guess someone has to take over.

111
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,292
-Huh. Well, you have the hat.
-Aye.

112
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,996
Does that mean I'm the captain now?

113
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:42,427
Hm. Very well then.
Tootles, sail the, uh… sail.

114
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:46,795
Righteous.

115
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:51,768
I got a list of questions for you.
Firstly, where do you get snacks at sea?

116
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,651
How many swords
can you hold at the same time?

117
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:59,149
Oh, are dolphins total party animals?
'Cause that's what I've heard.

118
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,364
Listen up, me hearties.

119
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:05,454
If I can no longer be the captain
of me old crew, I'll be yours.

120
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:10,331
Now, let's start with pirate basics.
Give me your best "yo-ho-ho."

121
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:12,461
Yo-ho-ho!

122
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,458
What Mr. Peabody did was totally unfair,

123
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,211
so we're happy to join your new crew.

124
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:22,974
Aye. Now, pirates need to be tough
at all times, like this.

125
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,339
-[grunts]
-[gasps]

126
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:26,085
See what I did there?

127
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:29,387
Now let's see
your mighty strong pirate stance.

128
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,139
[all] Argh!

129
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,854
You'll be A-plus pirates in no time.

130
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:37,225
I'm glad you're here
to listen to my captain ways.

131
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:40,073
[sighs] I do miss my Queen B, though.

132
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:43,989
Then let's blast on over to her.
I got a hankering for sailing.

133
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,360
Peaches, you and I see eye to eye.

134
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:49,447
She is my ship, after all.
Let's go, mateys.

135
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,830
[gasps] Queen Barnacle! My vessel!

136
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,673
-Oh no.
-Queen B!

137
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,838
Houston, we have a pirate problem.

138
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,091
[gasps] Dante's aboard.

139
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,302
There's no captain.

140
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:08,342
We gotta catch up before someone
gets hurt. Know of any other ships?

141
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,348
Ships? No.

142
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,680
But I know the best whale
to sail the seven seas.

143
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:19,475
Whee! Hold on.
It's gonna be a bumpy ride.

144
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:22,194
-Whoo-hoo!
-[laughing]

145
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,145
Do the wave!

146
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:29,815
Ah! I would, but I'm gonna need
both wings to hold on for dear life!

147
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:32,367
There's Queen B! Blimey.

148
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,292
A storm is heading our way.

149
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,580
You sure about that, Captain Finn?

150
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:38,463
This is us, lass.

151
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,381
We need some turbo-mega-super speed.

152
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,131
You betcha.

153
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:47,223
Oh, why do you have
to make everything so scary?

154
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,680
No, I have to make
everything an adventure!

155
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,601
-Whoo-hoo!
-[Dudley screams]

156
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,604
Now for question number 410.

157
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:56,813
Whoa!

158
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,313
[Dante screams]

159
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:01,274
Easy, ship. You're totally buggin'.

160
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:04,645
So, like, what do we do
about these mondo rocky waves?

161
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:08,074
Aye.
Uh, that's a question for Captain Finn.

162
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,824
-[thunder crashes]
-Whoa!

163
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,579
Oh! Anchors aweigh. Like, literally.

164
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:18,623
Thanks, Mrs. Sanchez. We got it from here.

165
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,876
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of krill.

166
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:26,046
Whoa. Hey, dudes.
How'd you get here so quick?

167
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:29,050
A captain knows how to lead her crew.

168
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,758
Ahoy, Finn. What a relief to see you.

169
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,925
Aye. Time to focus, crew.

170
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,385
-Uh-oh.
-Yo-ho-no!

171
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:41,095
We got to sail out of here
before we hit the eye of the storm.

172
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,727
Uh-um, matey?

173
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:45,323
Right! Here you go, Finn. [chuckles]

174
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,239
That's Captain Finn to you.

175
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,606
[grunts] The ship's stuck.

176
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:52,907
[all scream]

177
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,410
Now we've really hit rock bottom.

178
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,913
No need to fret.

179
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,584
[grunts] I have a plan.

180
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,333
Be my right-hand matey?

181
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,334
Absolutely. Argh!

182
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,586
We'll need to get to the crow's nest

183
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,839
for a bird's-eye view of the problem.
Follow my lead.

184
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:10,263
[grunts]

185
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:17,011
Looks like the anchor
is stuck under a rock.

186
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,638
All hands on deck!

187
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,144
Chip, Tootles, steady the sail.

188
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,935
The rest of you, grab that rope and pull.

189
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,904
Aye-aye, Captain Finn.

190
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:34,413
Alrighty. On three. One, two, three.

191
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,280
[grunting]

192
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:39,787
Pull, mateys. Keep at it. Almost there.

193
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,080
[grunting]

194
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,674
[all screaming]

195
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:48,458
Well done, crew. We did it.

196
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,126
I was totally wrong.

197
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:52,384
Lady dudes can do anything.

198
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:53,926
Sorry I doubted you.

199
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,430
You have the coolest moves,
O captain, my captain.

200
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,183
Apology accepted, mate.

201
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,765
Just 'cause we're not in books,
doesn't mean we don't exist.

202
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,942
And I got my mighty
captain's hat after all, right?

203
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:09,652
Totes. You know, it turns out
you can be millions of years old

204
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,994
and still have stuff to learn.
[laughs]

205
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,199

If I could just figure out
a way to fix my exhibit.

226
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:31,072
You know,
this whole adventure inspired me.

227
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,112
I challenge you to a duel, Ridley.

228
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,114
Have at me, Captain Finn.

229
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,409
-[both] Ha!
-Ha-ha!

230
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,490
Huh!

231
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:41,954
-Ah!
-Ha-ha!

233
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,960
No one told me about a pirate show.

234
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,042
-Wow!
-Go, Ridley!

235
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,213

236
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,756

00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,642
-Take that!
-[grunts]

239
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,974
Argh! You beat me again.

240
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:07,346
Captain Finn is clearly
the champion of the sea.

241
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,845
[cheering]

242
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,557
-Yeah, Captain Finn!
-Go!

243
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:15,149
-Go, Ridley! You're the best!
-Amazing!

244
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,114
That was incredible! Yo-ho-ho!

245
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:22,735
You're the best shipmate
a pirate could ask for, but watch out.

246
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,235
[grunting]

247
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:25,616
Ahoy, Finn.

248
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,293
Okay, yeah.

249
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,501
