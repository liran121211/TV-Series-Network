[Ridley] Ridley's Christmas Carol.

24
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:17,538
-Happy holidays. Time to go ho-ho-home.
-[both laugh]

25
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,409
Have fun. And Merry Christmas.

26
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:22,576
Don't "Merry Christmas" me.
I hate Christmas.

27
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:24,745
Oh, the cheerfulness and mirth…

28
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:29,424
[gasps] …and money that I can't make
because we're closed for business.

29
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:33,376
Are you kidding, Mr. P?
Christmas is the best.

30
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,098
It's my favorite holiday.

31
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,678
Bah humbug.

32
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,563
Somebody's got a case of the Scrooges.

33
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,728
I'll be back in the morning.

34
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,900
-Is it time yet?
-Hold on. Didn't hear Peabody leave.

35
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:48,649
-[clattering]
-[Peabody] Ow! Who put that wall here?

36
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:51,113
-[door closes]
-Ah. Now Mr. P is gone.

37
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,704
I can't wait.

38
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:53,949
For what?

39
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,410
Uh, my very first Christmas
with the Eyes Team.

40
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:00,912
Oh, right, you've never
spent Christmas here before.

41
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:04,995
-But, Ridley, I gotta warn you--
-Merry Christmas, everyone.

42
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:08,383
The Eyes might not have
the spirit you're looking for.

43
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,881
[barking]

44
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,264
[laughs]

45
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,340
It's Christmas Eve, everyone.

46
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:15,885
-Yikes.
-No way.

47
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:19,099
-I hate Christmas.
-What a foul celebration.

48
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,560
Wait, what?

49
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,310
[Ma] Timber!

50
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,772
Ridley! Look out!

51
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,607
Oh no! The Christmas tree!

52
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,569
Or as I like to call it,
Christmas kindling.

53
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,860
Chopping up this tree
will keep us warm for the whole winter.

54
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:37,566
Um, you live in a place
with indoor heating.

55
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,657
And why would you chop up
a Christmas tree?

56
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:43,543
We don't celebrate Christmas
in these parts.

57
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,081
What? Why?

58
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:49,745
Christmas is the best time of the year.
I don't understand what's happening.

59
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:54,836
I was so excited to finally
get to spend Christmas with you guys.

60
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:57,224
-But, like, why, dudette?
-It's awful.

61
00:02:57,302 --> 00:03:02,272
Thing is, Mr. P hates Christmas,
so he wants everyone else to hate it too.

62
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,808
[growling]

63
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,309
[sighs] It's true, Sunshine.

64
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,854
He closes the museum,

65
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:11,607
makes us take down the decorations,
and has all his employees--

66
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:16,281
-That's me. I'm all of them.
-Do inventory on Christmas Day.

67
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,572
So we can't strut our stuff.

68
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:23,156
Or stampede or even move all day.

69
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,664
Ugh. We hate Christmas.

70
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:30,497
-That's awful. How did I never notice?
-I covered for your mom and grandma.

71
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:34,045
They made such a great Christmas
in the tree house.

72
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,380
You never came down to see this.

73
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:40,006
So you guys
have never had a real Christmas.

74
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:44,144
No trying to sleep
while you're waiting for Santa to come?

75
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,774
Or squeezing the stockings
to guess what's inside?

76
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,982
Or singing Christmas carols?

77
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:54,653
No, but we do know a Christmas carol.

78
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,994

I get to show you
the true meaning of Christmas,

105
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:22,028
kind of like in my favorite
Christmas story, A Christmas Carol.

106
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:24,123
Come on. I'm gonna read it to you.

107
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:29,536
"…and Scrooge loved Christmas
from that day forth."

108
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,160
The end.

109
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:36,167
Whoa. I laughed, I cried.
I totally felt the Christmas spirit.

110
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,712
-Is it over?
-Yup.

111
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:41,965
[sighs] You should warn a bird
when a story has ghosts.

112
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,430
But the Christmas ghosts showed Scrooge

113
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,560
how to stop being mean
and start being sweet.

114
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:52,228
Scrooge reminds me of someone.
Hm, I just can't put my hoof on who.

115
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,480
[Peabody]
What is all the joyful merriment in there?

116
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:59,903
Wait, got it.
Scrooge reminds me of Peabody.

117
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,824
Merry Museum Mayday, everyone.

118
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,863
-Let's go!
-Let's get out of here!

119
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:08,366
The decorations are still up.
What is the meaning of this, Ms. Jones?

120
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:11,751
Mr. Peabody,
everyone deserves a proper Christmas.

121
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:12,959
Even the exhibits--

122
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,579
I mean, everyone in the museum
who is alive, like Lonny.

123
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:19,167
I am talking about Lonny.

124
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:21,803
No, they don't,
and Lonny certainly doesn't.

125
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,341
I wish there was a way
to give you some Christmas spirit.

126
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:29,006
[chuckles] Impossible.
Now, take all of this down.

127
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,305
-Oh, and give me that.
-No.

128
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,931
-Yes.
-No.

129
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:35,097
Ms. Jones! Ah!

130
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,191
[gasps]

131
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,858

00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,115

00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,120
[grunts]

134
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:53,201
Two eyes, two legs,
two decorative wings.

135
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:56,367
[sighs]
Still room for improvement, but I'm okay.

136
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:59,747
I know a stylistic change of scenery
when I see one.

137
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,296
What happened?

138
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:08,009
-I have a feeling this is Christmas Past.
-I have a feeling we'd better, like, hide.

139
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:12,184
Hiding left. Hiding right.
Oh no, they're gonna run into me!

140
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,265
[gasps] Whoa!

141
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:14,349
Huh.

142
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,984
They can't see or hear us.

143
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:18,481
Ho-ho-no-no.

144
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:22,023
I hate Christmas. Boo, Christmas lights.

145
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,028
Bah humbug. [grunts]

146
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,820
I bet this is Mr. Peabody's past,

147
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:30,414
and we have until midnight
to make him love Christmas,

148
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:32,331
just like in A Christmas Carol.

149
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,831
[Dudley] Mr. Peabody, I presume?

150
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:37,963
-What's up, Mr. Peabody?
-Hi.

151
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,290
Ah! Get back!

152
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,625
Mr. P, meet Peaches,
Dudley, Dante, Fred, and Ismat.

153
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,842
Why are the exhibits moving?

154
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:46,302
And talking?

155
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:49,392
[snorts] Hi, Scrooge. Oh, I mean, Peabody.

156
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,339
[panting]

157
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:51,638
What is happening?

158
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:55,561
Um, something I'm hoping
you don't remember tomorrow morning.

159
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,481
Do you recognize this?

160
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,350
Of course I do. It's the museum.

161
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:03,688
But wait. Wait.
This isn't the museum today.

162
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:06,364
-It's…
-Your Christmas Past.

163
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,154
Eh, too big. Hm?

164
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:10,911
Too small.

165
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:12,487
Huh.

166
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:13,655
Just right.

167
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:14,953
That's me.

168
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:17,496
Welcome to the past, Mr. P, dude.

169
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,460
As you can see here,
you, um, totally like mustaches.

170
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:26,052
-Very on-brand. [chuckles]
-I used to love that mustache exhibit.

171
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:30,930
[chuckles] Little did I know that one day,
my face would sport an even better one.

172
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,930
Hello? Hello? Young man?

173
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,353
He can't see you.

174
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:38,351
The tree. Wait. I know this day.

175
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:42,364
I… I hate this day.
Ms. Jones, why are we here?

176
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:45,898
There must be
something important for us to see.

177
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,993
No! Absolutely not.

178
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,399
Nothing important to see here at all.

179
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:54,328
Ooh, I do love
putting the star on the tree.

180
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,118
It's beautiful.

181
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,792
It is, isn't it?

182
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,670
Yes. Everything in here is.

183
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:04,668
I love this museum
almost as much as I love Christmas.

184
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,422
Well, aren't you delightful?

185
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,514
-What's your name?
-Filbert.

186
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:11,469
Filbert, huh? Well, that's adorable.

187
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:16,101
You're welcome here anytime, Filbert.
You seem like you're one of us.

188
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,850
One of you? Uh, thank you!

189
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:22,193
Today is my favorite day.

190
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,360
I dare you to take that star.

191
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:28,189
No way. I double dare you to do it.

192
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,856
Fine. Chicken.

193
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,115
-[boy] Huh.
-[gasps]

194
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:37,448
Hey, you can't do that.
Leave that star alone.

195
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,905
Then come up here and stop me.

196
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,536
I, uh… I…

197
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:46,094
[clears throat] What's going on here?

198
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:49,048
[gasps] Mom! The star is missing!

199
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,920
It can't be. I just put it up there.

200
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:53,928
He did it.

201
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,640
Yeah. That kid's the thief.

202
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,600
Nuh-uh. That other kid stole it. [scoffs]

203
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:01,311
That star's been
with the museum for decades.

204
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:05,772
-How could you do such a thing?
-Now, Filbert, what happened to the star?

205
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,015
I…

206
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,646
I didn't take it. I… I swear.

207
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,864
He's lying.
I saw him throw it in the trash.

208
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:13,985
We all saw it.

209
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:17,451
I'm sorry, Filbert,
but you'll have to leave the museum.

210
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:18,623
But I didn't.

211
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,831
You heard her. Leave now.

212
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,041
No.

213
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:24,794
[sniffles]

214
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:31,764
You loved the museum,
and you didn't steal the star.

215
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,379
No. I didn't. I would never.

216
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:39,258
No wonder you hate the museum,
and Christmas.

217
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:43,637
[weeps] I hate the museum
because it is an old building

218
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,476
filled with old things
that no one cares about.

219
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:50,232
It has nothing to do
with that beautiful, beautiful star.

220
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,066
Can we leave now? I hate the past.

221
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,822
I… I demand to leave this nightmare.

222
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:59,525
There's something in this past
we're supposed to see.

223
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,527
But what?

224
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,238
[sighs] I don't know.

225
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:10,292
[gasps] The star.
It started Peabody's hatred of Christmas.

226
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,168
Maybe if we can get it back?

227
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,094
Whoo-hoo! [laughs]

228
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,763
Watch out, dudes!

229
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,644
Ugh. Total tail fail.

230
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,099
-[clock chimes]
-Oh no!

231
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,849
I bet we're about to leave Christmas Past.

232
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,522
Without the star.

233
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,557
[all scream]

234
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,899
[all grunt]

235
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:34,072
This must be Christmas Present.

236
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:37,151
Another Christmas, another inventory.

237
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:40,238
Uh, I hate to be the bison of bad news,

238
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:43,454
but he doesn't seem
any more in the Christmas spirit.

239
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:47,583
Wait, a Christmas tree.
Maybe he did change.

240
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:54,669
I'm gonna go with not quite there yet
at giving Peabody the Christmas spirit.

241
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:55,585
[chuckles]

242
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:59,303
Ho-ho-ho. One last thing
to count on inventory night.

243
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,005
Hot biscuits and gravy.

244
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:04,095
His heart is at least two sizes too small.

245
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:08,191
Yeah. Well, let's see what's happening
in the rest of the museum.

246
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:12,774
Twenty-seven dung beetle dung balls,
28 dung beetle dung balls,

247
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:16,687
29 dung beetle dung balls.
That's a lot of dung beetle dung balls.

248
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:20,107
Wait, why is she smiling?
She should be frowning.

249
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,697
Sad. Miserable.

250
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:24,912
She's doing inventory
instead of home with her family.

251
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:28,374
-Christmas really is for family.
-See?

252
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:31,126
And that's why it warms
my Christmas heart

253
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,248
to be spending it with you.

254
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,955
Even if it means
counting the bug collection.

255
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:40,716
One slug. Ugh.
Two slugs. Ugh. Three slugs. Ugh!

256
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:45,431
Well, I'll be my uncle's niece.
We're helping Lonny with inventory.

257
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:48,524
Thanks again
for helping me with inventory.

258
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,351
It's gonna go way faster
with all of you here.

259
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,517
Anytime, Lonny.

260
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:56,145
And sorry Peabody
makes you do this on Christmas Day.

261
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:59,493
Ah, it's okay.
If I'm honest, I kind of like it.

262
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:03,660
Christmas is about being with family.
You guys are my family.

263
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:07,201
Okay, now I'm getting
the Christmas spirit.

264
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,076
Get over here, you big galoot.

265
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,503
I'll admit, Christmas isn't so bad,

266
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:15,422
but I'm not feeling Christmassy enough
to forgive Peabody.

267
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,673
-No way.
-Me neither, Sunshine.

268
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:21,375
This is what I have to say about that guy.

269
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:26,007
-Why, I never.
-I know Peabody's terrible.

270
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,346
But I kind of feel bad for the guy.

271
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:33,062
Imagine being that miserable. Oh,
sometimes I just want to give him a hug.

272
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:36,475
Maybe we can, uh, listen a moment longer?

273
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,395
I think we're getting to him.

274
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,364
-[clock chimes]
-No. We need a little bit longer.

275
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,105
-We're out of time.
-Whoa!

276
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,791
Christmas Future.

277
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:52,869
-The great unknown.
-I sure hope our story has a happy ending.

278
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:57,037
[gasps] Look at the person
who looks like you, but not like you,

279
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,087
'cause they're older than you.

280
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:02,301
Oh. That is you. I mean, Ridley.

281
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,803
That's me?

282
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:06,934
Looks like you're coming home
from college.

283
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,892
Mama, Grandma, I… I'm home.

284
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,984
Why are the doors locked?

285
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,352
Mama? Eyes?

286
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,975
Where is everyone? What's going on?

287
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:22,316
Ah! This is straight
out of my worst nightmare.

288
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:27,243
Well, well, well.
Looks like my evil plan worked after all.

289
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:28,994
What evil plan?

290
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,366
Oh, just the worst Christmas ever.

291
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:32,373
Mama?

292
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,210
[gasps] An eviction notice?

293
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,631
Peabody kicked us out of the museum?

294
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,880
Mama? I'm here.

295
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:42,972
Oh, Ridley, I'm so glad you're home.

296
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:46,678
Why is everything in boxes?
Where is everyone?

297
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,550
We have some bad news.

298
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,307
You tell her. I can't.

299
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:55,559
Peabody is closing the museum.
We all have to find a new place to live.

300
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,194
Oh, I'm so sorry, dear.

301
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,111
What? He can't do that.

302
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:02,689
Apparently he can.
He sold all the artifacts.

303
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:05,526
It looks like it was his plan all along.

304
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,163
[chuckles]

305
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:11,949
Mama, Grandma, I'm so sorry.
I should've been here.

306
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:15,656
No, you're having the greatest
adventure of them all: college.

307
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,118
And you're here now.

308
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:21,086
Besides, we can't let Peabody
ruin our last Christmas here.

309
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,470
Yes, we can.
He kind of did already, right?

310
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:28,428
How can you think about
Christmassy stuff when our home is gone?

311
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:32,010
A house doesn't make a home.
Not even a cool tree house.

312
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,927
A house is a home
when people you love are in it.

313
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:38,147
You're here, and Grandma's here.
That's what matters.

314
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:39,438
[barking]

315
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,191
And don't forget about us.

316
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,403
[overlapping speech]

317
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,654
I missed you all so much.

318
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,026
Aw, you decorated.

319
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,823
Ever since you taught us
to love Christmas,

320
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:54,618
we never miss a chance
to pull out the Christmas lights.

321
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:59,383
And compete over who has the best
Christmas lights display at their exhibit.

322
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,538
-Ho-ho!
-Galactically festive.

323
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,418
-Mummazing.
-[Dante] Bodacious.

324
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,415
[Fred] Love it.

325
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,416
Merry Christmas, everyone.

326
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,508
Merry Christmas.

327
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:11,223
-[barking]
-[laughing]

328
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,853
Mama, you're right.

329
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:16,520
Wherever we go,
as long as we're together, it'll be home.

330
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,890
[all laughing]

331
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,347
[muttering]

332
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:22,646
Christmas isn't
about the place or the presents.

333
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:25,321
It's not even about the decorations.

334
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:29,491
Christmas is about being
with the people that you love.

335
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,489
Aw.

336
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:32,913
[all laugh]

337
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,042
How can there still be mirth?

338
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:40,249
I made the worst Christmas possible,
and they're still happy.

339
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,082
How can that be?4

340
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:43,456
[gurgles]

341
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,424
