See anything out there, Sunshine?

25
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:19,451
Sandstorm. And it doesn't look friendly.

26
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,247
We'd better go tell Grandma.

27
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,093
There's a sandstorm on the way.

28
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:28,628
Oh, blast. Let me just get
this one last chunk of fossil.

29
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:34,967
Cool. One strong bison coming right up.

30
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,393
-[snorts]
-[all grunt]

31
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:39,851
Now, let's get out of here
before the sandstorm gets us.

32
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,683
-Dante, catch!
-Got it.

33
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,598
Let's get the peck out of here.

34
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,017
Step on it, Ridley.

35
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:51,533
[all] Whoa!

36
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:56,367
Must go, like, faster. Ooh!

37
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,279
-[Dudley] Oh!
-[Dante] Whoo!

38
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:02,205
Grandma, be ready
to close the portal behind us.

39
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:03,748
We're gonna have to jump.

40
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,082
Everybody, hold on to your hippocampus.

41
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:09,337
[all] Whoa!

42
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:12,971
[Peaches] Great butterscotch bananas!

43
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:17,974
That was a bit close for comfort.

44
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:20,604
But we made it out with the fossils,
so it was worth it.

45
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,942
Let's get those fossils to your lab
and see what you discovered.

46
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,056
Aha!

47
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,146
Looks like we found the yutyrannus.

48
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,611
Yuty-what now?

49
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,991
I'm a dinosaur,
and even I never heard of that dino bro.

50
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:38,369
The yutyrannus is a recently discovered
relative of the tyrannosaurus rex.

51
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:42,119
And what makes
this dinosaur so interesting is--

52
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:44,963
Oh! It's got feathers. Like a bird.

53
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,289
That's right.

54
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:49,254
Birds evolved from dinosaurs.

55
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:53,665
In fact, most paleontologists
consider birds to be living dinosaurs.

56
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:56,926
Consider my Cretaceous cranium blown.

57
00:02:57,552 --> 00:03:01,352
It's a real bummer
that your ancestors evolved into birds.

58
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,561
We could have been dino bros.

59
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,601
Excuse me.

60
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,895
Birds are far superior to dinosaurs.

61
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,440
We can fly.
Well, most of us can. No offense, Dudley.

62
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,025
Oh. [grunts]

63
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,240
I keep trying.

64
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,860
Wait, birds can, like, fly and stuff,

65
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:21,487
but they are way teeny-tiny
compared to dinosaurs.

66
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:24,786
We were some of the biggest,
most megalo-super creatures

67
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,961
ever to stomp and romp the Earth.

68
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,540
Dinos and dodos are both amazing.

69
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,666
That's right, little Dudely dodo.

70
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:34,263
Birds are still cool,
even if they're tiny.

71
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,259
At least there's some of us left.

72
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,341
-Oh yes.
-Yeah.

73
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,045
-Oh, you tell him.
-Well, low blow.

74
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:43,135
Huh. Are you saying
dodos are better than dinos?

75
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,813
Maybe I am.

00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:48,141

Nice job, Dudley.

135
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,302
You outran that herd
for almost half a mile.

136
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,255
I did? That means I led the herd.

137
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,716
[gasps] I win! Birds win.

138
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,057

139
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:36,481
Uh, that was, like, an accident.
It totally doesn't count.

140
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,272
Sounds like herding
didn't solve the issue.

141
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:43,857
But don't worry,
I have another idea how to settle this.

142
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:48,874
Queen Ismat decrees that whoever
solves the riddle of the Sphinx…

143
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,660
That's me, Thoebe the Sphinx.

144
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,624
…will be deemed the winner.

145
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:56,834
Hmm. What's a good riddle for you two?

146
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,246
Got to think. Got to think. Let me see.

147
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,205
Oh! I've got a good one.

148
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:02,165
[clears throat]

149
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:07,835
When people see my big round eyes,
they say that I look very wise.

150
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:13,597
So please say hi. I'm quite a hoot
when dressed up in my feather suit.

151
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,893
The wise winged hooter is the dodo bird.

152
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,148
Obviously.

153
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:21,229
You chose… poorly!

154
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:22,725
[all scream]

155
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,897
Dante, you want to try to solve it?

156
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,946
A hoot?
Dude, that sounds like an owl to me.

157
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,450
Yup, that's it. An owl.

158
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,743
You did it, Dante. Yay for you.

159
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:37,248
Well, Dudely Dudley,
looks like I won the riddle.

160
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,421
Dinos are best. [chuckles]

161
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,710
Maybe you guessed right,

162
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:45,554
but the answer was an owl,
and owls are birds,

163
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,761
so that still means birds
are the number one bestest.

164
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,513
[snorts]
Oh, we still haven't settled anything.

165
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,346
Maybe not, but I think
this here space monkey

166
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:58,392
might have an idea how to solve
this conundrum once and for all.

167
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:03,114
Way I see it, whichever of y'all
is best prepared for space

168
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,571
ought to be the winner.

169
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:08,740
This is gonna be one
bodaciously giant leap for dino-kind.

170
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:14,621
Who needs to leap when you can fly,
which is a thing that birds do sometimes.

171
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,292
Count us down, Sunshine?

172
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,040
[all] Three, two, one.

173
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,003
Blastoff!

174
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,843
[Dudley] Wait. What's going on?
What's going on? Stop!

175
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,840
Bogus!

176
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,171
[both screaming]

177
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,006
[beeping]

178
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,551
Uh, Peaches, what's going on?

179
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:35,523
Not sure.
The simulators were on autopilot.

180
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,848
There shouldn't be any way to mess it up.

181
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:41,234
Leave it to those two
to mess up the un-mess-uppable.

182
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,272
[screaming]

183
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,776
I command you to make it stop.

184
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,819
Sweet banana sundae!

185
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:52,823
They're going into virtual hyperspace!

186
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,616
-Birds.
-Dinosaurs.

187
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,164
-Birds!
-Dinosaurs!

188
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,668
[screaming]

189
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,297
[both grunt]

190
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,669
Dante, Dudley, are you okay?

191
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,676
This has gone far enough.

192
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,338
You've always been friends.

193
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:15,386
You shouldn't let anyone
divide you up into different groups.

194
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:18,811
I'm with Ridley.
Y'all should call it a draw.

195
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:22,351
Yeah, I think you should
shake hands and be friends again.

196
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,556
-Okay, sure.
-Fine with me.

197
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,647
Now, let's clean up this mess.

198
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:30,902
You know, I would've totally won
if those simulators didn't go all loopy.

199
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,567
We should pick our own challenge.

200
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:37,866
Word. And since I know
I can win at anything, I'll let you pick.

201
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:41,412
Oh, well, I, um… I pick, uh…

202
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:43,418
Sand surfing!

203
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:44,669
Sand surfing?

204
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,750
You better bring your avian game, Dudely.

205
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:51,717
Oh, I will bring it and wing it. Hm.

206
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:56,137
Oh no. I got to go tell Ridley. Oh.

207
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,016
Okay, Dudley, dude.

208
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:03,848
First one to surf back through the portal
and into the museum is the winner.

209
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,096
Yeah. Okay.

210
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:09,317
And when I win, that will prove
that birds are better than dinos.

211
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,610
Never gonna happen, dodo bro-bro.

212
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:15,244
I say, less rhyming and more slime-ing.

213
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,953
I mean, surfing.

214
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,083
Whoa! Ha!

215
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,833
[grunts] More surfing is what I meant. Hm.

216
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:24,252
On your mark, get set…

217
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,042
Dodo!

218
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,375
Wait a second!
I don't know how to sand surf!

219
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,172
And even if I did,
I'm not near brave enough to do this.

220
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,796
Whoa!

221
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:37,263
Whoa! Ah! Eek! Ah! Oh! Ay!

222
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,055
Dudely? Dudely! Oh!

223
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,309
Whoa!

224
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,770
Ah! Ah.

225
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:46,310
[panting] I sure wish Dante was here.
He'd know what to do.

226
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,645
Brontobunga!

227
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,109
Dante! You came to save me!

228
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,493
Well, yeah.

229
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:57,109
Dino or dodo,
you're still my little birdy buddy.

230
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:00,278
Whoa! This river's getting rough.

231
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,368
-Bogus!
-Ah!

232
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,163
Dante, grab on!

233
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,076
[both grunt]

234
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,791
Whoa! Uh-oh.

235
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,424
My claws are slipping!

236
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,291
Dante, I got you, buddy!

237
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:14,218
Whoa. Thanks, Dudely.
I was about to be dino-donezo.

238
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,128
Yeah, that was a close one.

239
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:19,177
Hey, look, we're hanging
onto another dinosaur fossil.

240
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,431
I wonder if this dino had feathers.

241
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,434
You know, it would actually be
kind of cool to have feathers.

242
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:28,347
And it would have been amazing
to live in the time of dinosaurs.

243
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:32,357
I can't believe we let anybody
divide us up and make us argue.

244
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:36,031
Yeah, who cares
if dinos or dodos are best?

245
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:40,072
No matter what, you'll always
be my little dodo Dudely dude.

246
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:44,037
You'll always be my big dino bro.

247
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,790
-[both scream]
-[Dante] Oh no!

248
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,422
[Grandma] There they are, Ridley.

249
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,381
Grab on!

250
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,263
[all grunting]

251
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,763
Thanks for coming to save us.

252
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,682
Righteous rescue.

253
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:03,222
I just hope you've ended
your argument by now.

254
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:07,055
We sure have. I don't want
to fight with my little dodo bro-bro.

255
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:11,273
It doesn't matter who's better.
What matters is our friendship.

256
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,065
That sounds perfect.

257
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,069
Now what do you say we head on home?

258
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,491
Yes, please. I need to rest my wings.

259
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,870
But on our way home, want to race?

260
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:23,328
Oh, you know it, Dudely.

261
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,409
[all laughing]

262
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,627
