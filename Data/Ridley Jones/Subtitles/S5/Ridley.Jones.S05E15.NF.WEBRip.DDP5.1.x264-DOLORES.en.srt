That's Grandma Jones' forklift.

25
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:21,206
And she's away
at a paleontology conference.

for the Jones family?

From an old friend.

Happy trails. [chuckles]

31
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:41,814
-She's gone. It's okay to come out.
-This is weird.

32
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:44,273
We weren't scheduled to have a delivery.

33
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:47,774
That crate's so big,
they ought to call it a crate-osaurus.

34
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:51,357
-Maybe there's treasure inside.
-Let me do some recon.

35
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:56,453
Says it was sent to Sarah Jones.

36
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,493
It's for Mama.

37
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:00,405
But she never said
she was expecting anything.

38
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:04,865
And the sender is Dr. Amanda Cornwallis.

39
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,418
Who's Amanda Cornwallis?

40
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,671
[gasps] No. It can't be.

-I haven't heard that name in a long time.
-[violin playing]

Who is that?

43
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:25,228
So, Ms. Jones, we meet again.

44
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,611
Mama, do you know her?

45
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:31,439
Oh, Sarah,
you never told your family about me?

46
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:34,986
I told my children,
Charles and Miranda, about you.

47
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:40,491
I came to visit because I managed
to locate the Finder's Stone.

48
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,657
The Finder's Stone is a myth.

49
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:44,995
And yet, here it is.

50
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,751
Using the Finder's Stone,

51
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,383
I discovered the location
of the famed Cinnabar Serpent.

52
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:53,591
Imagine my surprise
when I discovered that it's hidden

53
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,723
in one of the exhibits
here in this very museum.

54
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,261
Your museum.

55
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,564
And I brought my team to take it.

56
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,429
This is my team.

57
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:08,807
Lariat Lawson, Anubis,
Sibusio, and Questa.

58
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,857
We're the Eyes of the Museum,

59
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,110
and we won't let you
take anything that's not yours.

60
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:18,574
Yeah, don't make me show
just exactly how tough I am.

61
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,946
You want to play tough? [laughs]

62
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,294

63
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:25,208
How very noble of you, Ridley Jones.

64
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,418
[chuckles] So much like your mother.

65
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:28,918
You better believe it.

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,420
How will you stop me, when you'll be
busy trying to stop the Amazon River?

67
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,724
Why would we want to stop the Amazon?

68

[suspenseful music plays]

69
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:42,139
Good luck, Ms. Jones.

[laughs]

71
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,984
Come on. We've got to get in there
and stop the Amazon.

72
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:51,651
But, like, what about Dr. Cornwallis
and her bogus brigade?

73
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,021
We're protectors.

74
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:56,107
We take care of the museum
and deal with her later.

75
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,404
-[Ismat] Yeah!
-[Dante] Let's do this!

76
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,790
Look at all this water.
The Amazon must be dammed up.

77
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:06,748
And you can bet
Amanda Cornwallis is behind it.

78
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:09,209
Mama, how would you even know her?

79
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:13,250
Amanda and I were classmates
when we were both archeology students.

80
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:18,126
But she realized that she could make
lots more money by selling art, fossils,

81
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:22,386
and important artifacts
to private collectors rather than museums.

82
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,850
In private collections,
only a few people can see them.

83
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,182
That's horrible.

84
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,767
Her greed led her down a dark path.

85
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:32,942
Instead of becoming a protector,
she became a raider.

86
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:35,232
Look, dudes. Beaver dam ahoy.

87
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,650
Now that's awful strange.
There's no beavers in the Amazon.

88
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:43,617
Dr. Cornwallis must've put
the beavers here to sabotage the river

89
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,040
so we couldn't stop her
going after the Cinnabar Serpent.

90
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,580
We need to relocate those beavers
and get rid of this dam

91
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,495
so the Amazon can flow.

92
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,003

-Me? That looks dangerous.

in a crate for the next 50 years.

back in their natural habitat.

The last time
your Compass Eye disappeared,

167

it was because the artifact
in the Aztec exhibit was damaged.

176

never did care if she made a mess.

I always forget how mummazing she is.

180
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,266
There's a warning where the fragment was.

181
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:24,772
I haven't studied Aztec for years,
but I think it says,

182
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:31,355
"Whosoever removes the Cinnabar Serpent
shall awaken the temple's curse."

183
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:37,241
[grunts] Knowing Cornwallis, she probably
never bothered to read the warning.

184
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:43,331
Hey, look. A secret door leading
into this dark, spooky tunnel and I…

185
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:47,706
-[gasps] Never mind. Nothing to see here.
-That must be where they went.

186
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:52,625
We're gonna follow the spooky tunnel
right to the ancient curse, aren't we?

187
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:53,717
-Probably.
-Hm.

188
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:56,681
I need to stop discovering things.

189
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:57,972
This way, team.

190
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,478
It's easier making our way
through these Aztec ruins

191

and sprung all the booby traps.

192
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:12,528
Amanda Cornwallis is being reckless,
just like always.

193
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:17,032
I hope we can catch up
before they get to the Cinnabar Serpent.

[chuckles] Impressive. Didn't think
you'd escape the Amazon so quickly.

-You didn't count on me having my own.

You said we were too young.

she deserves to have her own.

-Spare me your speeches, Sarah.
-Your kids might've gotten hurt.

You never knew how to be careful.

208

And you were always
so worried about breaking things

209
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,656
that you never got things done.

210
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,245
All the years you worked at this museum,

211
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,001
and you never even knew
the Cinnabar Serpent

212
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,464
was right under your very noses.

213
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:14,134
I never looked for it,
because if the stories are true,

214
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,755
it's too powerful
and it should be left where it is.

215
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,513
Amanda, we were friends once.

Yes, it's true.

You were a good friend.
A very good friend.

It's not too late.
You can come to the good side.

I never told you because I thought
it was just a tale.

Legend says the Cinnabar Serpent
is one of three mystical artifacts

hidden in museums worldwide.

279
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:27,912
If anyone can gather all three,
they'd have the ability

to return all museum artifacts

you knew what a beak is by now.

No, not your beautiful beak. That.

291
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,988
I think it says to look
for the Aztec symbol for "family."

292
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:10,281
Righteous. All I have to do
is find the symbol for…

293

would open the door.
