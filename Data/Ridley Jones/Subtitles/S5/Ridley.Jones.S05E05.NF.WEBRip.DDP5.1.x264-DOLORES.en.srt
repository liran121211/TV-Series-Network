Lion manes combed, beach combed,
comb exhibit combed.

24
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:21,207
-What's next on our evening checklist?
-Ooh. Hey there, Eyes Team.

25
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,919
Having museum fun, as per usual?

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,790
-Affirmative.
-You know it.

27
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:28,957
I don't know if you know,
but ever since I found out

28
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:31,417
about you guys being alive and all,

29
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:35,598
I've been dying to go
on a bona fide Eyes Team adventure.

30
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:40,098
[chuckles] That floor's already shiny
as a buttered biscuit, Sunshine.

31
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,643
[chuckles] Oh. Right.

32
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:46,186
I guess I'm done for the night.
I, uh, should get going.

33
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,232
Unless…

34
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:51,186
Do you think
your old pal Lonny could tag along?

35
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:55,487
I'm jonesing for a mission,
pun practiced and very much intended.

36
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:59,743
Oh, um, we don't really
have a mission planned for tonight.

37
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:04,118
-We're just making our museum rounds.
-I don't mind. I just want to hang.

38
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,997
Pretty please
with priceless artifacts on top?

39
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,085
Uh…

40
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,629
-Yeah, sure.

43
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:16,846
Sorry. My bad.

44
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,888
Are we sure this is a good idea?

45
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:23,312
I'm not sure Lonny
is exactly cut out for Eyes Team action.

46
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:26,943
I know what you mean,
but it's been a quiet night so far

47
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:29,981
and we're just going through
the cleanup checklist.

48
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:34,276
I love a safe, predictable checklist.
It's check-bliss.

49
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:36,282
Sounds pretty Lonny-proof to me.

50
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:40,294
Come on, got to document
my first night on the team.

51
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,368
Say, "Eyes."

52
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:43,082
[all] Oh! Eyes?

53
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,753
Do I still have eyes?

54
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,292
[grunting]

55
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:52,836
Bringing dinner to the avian wing
is my favorite stop on the checklist.

56
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:53,762
Mm.

57
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,220
It's din-din time, little bird dudes.

58
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,841
Who's hungry?

59
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:02,102
Oh, hiya. I don't think we've met.

60
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,432
I'm Ridley, and this is the Eyes Team.

61
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,597
-What up?
-Charmed.

62
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,975
Nice to meet you. I'm Bill.
Oh, and thanks for the grub.

63
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:12,533
This bowerbird loves bowerbird-seed.

64
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:15,494
Mm!

65
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:21,155
Huh? That looks just like
my missing belt buckle.

66
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:22,742
What a coincidence.

67
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:25,577
You got great taste, my friend. [chuckles]

68
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,673
If only I could find that thing.

00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,169

-Ismat!
-Ismy!

75
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:46,385
-Dads? What's wrong?
-Your crown sapphire. It's… [gasps]

76
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,306
…missing.

77
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:50,193
But it's been in our family
for generations.

78
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,771
And it looks good with my eyes.
[chuckles]

79
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,147
We've got to find it.

80
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:58,244
Well, seems like we'll have
a classic Eyes mission tonight after all.

81
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:02,161
Yippee! Let me just put
my cleaning supplies away first.

82
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:06,202
Wait, we're not letting Lonny
join us for a real mission, right?

83
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:09,367
Well, we did promise
she could tag along tonight.

84
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:13,457
-Ridley's got a point, y'all.
-We'd be totes rude to tell her no.

85
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:17,924
Exactly. And I'm sure
Lonny's gotten the hang of things by now.

86
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,757
[Lonny grunts]

00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,971
Be right there! [chuckles]

89
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:26,556
So this is the last place
you saw the sapphire?

90
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:27,771
Yup. Right here.

91
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,560
Okay, Eyes. Let's dust for prints.

92
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,480
Hey, gang, take a look at this.
I think it's birdseed.

93
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:37,937
-[Ridley] Hm.
-Ah!

-[Lonny] Sorry, pals.

96
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:46,868
[laughs] Good thing this is the Eyes Team
and not the Nose Team, am I right?

97
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:50,293
-[laughs]
-Um, Ridley, a word?

98
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,043
[sighs] It pains me to say,

99
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,585
Fred was right.
I don't think Lonny is ready for this.

100
00:04:55,670 --> 00:05:01,180
This isn't any old life-or-death mission.
This is about jewelry. My jewelry.

101
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,219
Everyone makes mistakes, Ismat.

102
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:07,683
You know, I think I'm gonna
mosey on over to the security room.

103
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,345
Great idea, Peaches.

104
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:12,064
We can check
the security footage for clues.

105
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,225
Oh, that's my office. I'll go, too.

106

108
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:22,987
Okay, if we wait one more second,
we'll see the culprit right…

109
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,072
here.

110
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:28,703
Lonny, I think you just
erased the footage.

111
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:31,496
Oh, pickles. I'm sorry, Peaches.

112
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,291
[sighs] That's all right.

113
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,665
Ah! Oop! Sorry again.

115
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,592
It's okay, Lonny.

116
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:44,013
I saw Ma and Pa
before the footage was erased.

117
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:47,643
-Let's start by talking to them.
-Wah-hoo! We have a lead.

-I command you to stop!

Eat my dust, thieves! [chuckles]

124
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,938
We got to go after them.

125
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,454
[Ma] They're gaining on us, Pa!

126
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,414

-Got you.

Ma, Pa, it's time for you
to return Ismat's crown sapphire.

130
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:24,433
-Her whosie-what now?
-My crown sapphire. In your wagon.

131
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,465
We didn't take no sapphire.

132
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:28,393
You didn't?

133
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,851
Why did you run
when you saw us coming?

134
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,062
You were trying to steal our loot.

135
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:36,192
We found this grahammy cracker feast.

136
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,820
You can't be too careful.
There's thieves around here.

137
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,569
Our favorite shiny bottle cap is missing.

138
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,992
Missing, you say?
Can you describe the missing item?

139
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,162
Uh, bottle cap. Blue. Shiny.

140
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,581
Real shiny.

141
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,329
Shiny, blue. Go on.

142
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:56,211
[groans] This is a dead end.
Let's move on, folks.

143
00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:00,670
Did you say your stuff is missing?
Because I'm missing something too.

144
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,383
Interesting.

145
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,013
I lost my marbles.

146
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,550
Huh. You're not the only one, kiddo.

147
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,894
Where did you last have them, Pedro?

148

When I was playing
in the alpine exhibit…

149
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,853
Right here.

150
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,274
I put them down to make a snowman,

151
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:19,023
and then they were gone.

152
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,395

-Truth.

than a mule in roller skates.

I'm not saying I told you so,
but I told you so.

I know. Look, you're right.

makes things a lot harder.

174
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,584
-Uh-huh.
-For sure.

175

[sniffles]

176
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:23,540
But we all made mistakes
when we first became a team.

177
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,878
We need to be more patient with Lonny.

I guess I used to be a little queenly.

194
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:30,608
Ralph had some trouble
adjusting to the team too.

195
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:34,525
Maybe there's a chance
I wasn't always so great

196
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:37,735
at admitting when I might not
be totally right.

197
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:38,787
Huh?

198
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:41,748
Oh.

199
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,501
We have to go talk to Lonny.

200
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:46,996
Hi, Lonny.

201
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,086
Hey.

202
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:52,090
We wanted to apologize
for being so impatient.

203
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:55,854
Because we realized
we need to be better teammates.

204
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,098
Nah, it's okay.

205
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:01,059
I heard what you said about me,
and it's true. [sighs]

206
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,146
I'm not cut out to be on the team.

207
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:08,728
-Oof. I guess I won't be needing this.
-Wait. Lonny, what is that?

208
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,026
Oh, this? That's my clue board.

209
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,660
I'd been collecting clues
and putting them on here.

210
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:17,529
You see,
between the birdseed and the feather,

211
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,367
I got to thinking
the perp's probably a bird.

212
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:24,293
I noticed the things that went missing,
and they're all shiny.

213
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:28,543
So I asked myself,
"Lonny, what bird likes shiny things?"

214
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:33,048
Then I answered myself,
"Well, Lonny, that'd be the bowerbird."

215
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:38,258
And Bill's exhibit says
they like to decorate with shiny objects.

216
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,596
Lonny, you cracked the case!

217
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,021
I know, I really messed it up.

218
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,890
Wait, do you mean I solved it?

219
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,437
You sure did. To the avian wing.

220
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,731
I know a shortcut.

221
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,324
Hey, Bill. We're missing some stuff.

222
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:57,821
-Think we could take a peek at your nest?
-Oh, sure! It's sort of messy, but…

223
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,827
My crown sapphire!

224
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,539
That's yours? I'm so sorry.

225
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,870
I didn't mean to take people's stuff.

226
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,575
Please, take it all back.

227
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:12,247
Oh, so shiny.

228
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,088
[both grunting]

229
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:17,427
-Uh, Bill?
-Oh, right. [chuckles]

230
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,390
Sorry.

231
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,259
[grunts] Aha!

232
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:24,726
I just love, love, love shiny things.

233
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:28,899
I go all gaga-bird-brained
when I see something shiny.

234
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:31,359
Hm. Shiny, huh?

235
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:42,579
[gasps] Oh, I love, love, love it.
Thank you.

236
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,250
All right! [chuckles]

237
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:50,326
Lonny, your queen thanks you
for finding the royal crown sapphire.

238
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,498
You're a righteous teammate.

239
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:56,256
And we'd love it
if you joined the Eyes Team officially.

240
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,760
Oh, thanks, pals. I'd love to.

241
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,764
I'll be on every mission,
except when I'm working,

242
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,347
which is weeknights
and sometimes weekends.

243
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:10,353
-But not holidays. Except I'm not here--
-So… I guess you wouldn't want this then?

244
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,398
[gasps] My very own Eyes Team bandana?

245
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:14,782
Ooh!

246
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,359
Yay! [chuckles]

247
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:19,864
I think this calls for another
Eyes Team photo.

248
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,407
What do you say, Lon?

249
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,030
I'd say, "Eyes on three?"

250
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:27,748
One, two, Eyes!
