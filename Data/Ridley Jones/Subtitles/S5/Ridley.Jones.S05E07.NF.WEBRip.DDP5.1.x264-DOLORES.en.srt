I love how these boots look, but they…

-…aren't made for adventuring.
-I got you, Ridley.

26

Luckily, the runway won't be snowy.

27
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:26,000
Wait, maybe we should add snow.

28
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,876
It's so awesome of your dads
to include us in their fashion show.

29
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:33,474
Well, with a theme like Fashion Emergency,

30
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:37,181

to be the stars of the runway.

31
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:40,233

33
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,442
Is everyone runway-ready?

34
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,855
-Totally.
-Affirmative.

35
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:53,573
But isn't the runway indoors?
I'm freezing my tuchus off here.

36
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:57,485
It is, but I wanted
to test out our gear in the field.

37
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:00,285
This is the first time
my dads have invited me

38
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,870
to be a part of their big show,
and I can't let them down.

39

Speaking of down, are these pants
supposed to… [laughs]

40
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,382
…keep falling down?

Fashion isn't about
being functional, dude.

42
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:14,337
You look dodo chic, Dudley.
That's what matters.

43
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:17,505
Chic, huh? Then I'm on board--

00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,465
Whoa! [screams]

00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,266
Got you, Sunshine.

-Huh! Dads. Always giving me praise.

Hi, Dads. We're in the throne room.

An intruder.

-Definitely a ghost.

-I'll check it out.
-Careful.

Oh, a sweet itty-bitty kitten. Ooh!

-Hey, little dude.

00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:06,266

-"Cleo" for short.

…start up my allergies,
but it's so worth it.

74
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,302
She's as sweet as banana pudding pie.

75
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,804
-And she has the softest fur.

Sure, she's cute,

77
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:46,639
but we have a fashion show
to prepare for, right?

78
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:48,193
Right, Dads?

-Dads?

Isn't it time
for our mid-afternoon grape platter?

81
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:56,529
And where's my dancing peacocks?

83
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,447
Hm? Oh, Ismat.

84
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,330
Didn't you say you wanted
more normalcy at home?

85
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,288
Less doting. Less gloating.

86
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:08,159
I guess. But I didn't mean this normal.

87
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:11,168
Hey, Ismat. Is everything okay?

88
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,671
Absolutely.

89
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,672
I just want my grapes
and peacocks and, you know,

90
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:19,125
just the usual attention
I get from my dads.

91
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:24,427
This cat is cramping my style.
But it's not like I'm jealous or anything.

92
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:27,806
Fine. I'm jealous, okay?

93
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:32,442
It's just, I'm so used
to being the center of my dads' world.

94
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:36,612
I don't like seeing them
pouring all their love over someone else.

how much they love you.

Why is Cleo attending dress rehearsal?

105
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,234
This is a closed set.

We didn't want to leave her alone.
Did we, Cleo-leo-weo?

-But, Dads--
-To the costume wing.
