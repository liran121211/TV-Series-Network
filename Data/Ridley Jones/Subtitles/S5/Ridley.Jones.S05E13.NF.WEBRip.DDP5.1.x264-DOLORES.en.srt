[Ridley] Pedro Busts a Move.

24
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,701
Help! Please help me!

25
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,744
[Peaches] Ten-four, little buddy!

26
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:23,293
I found Pedro, but I can't land
on that ice floe without tipping it over.

27
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:25,004
We need to move fast.

28
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,625
Thanks to Captain Finn,
I've got just what I need.

29
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:30,342
Turn hard to starboard, first mate Dante.

30
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:33,053
Wait, is starboard
Ralph's left or Ralph's right?

31
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:36,264
-Right.
-Uh, and is my tail's right my right?

32
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,426
-Go that way.
-Aye, aye, Captain Dudette.

33
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,230
We'll take it from here, Peaches.
Now let's go save Pedro.

34
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,981
-Aye, matey.
-Argh!

35
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,773
[Ridley] Port. Starboard. Whoa, port!

36
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,485
-Whoa.
-That was a close one.

37
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:52,778
Oh right. My other starboard.

38
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,282
We've got one Pedro straight ahead.

39
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,583
[grunts]

40
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,535
Oh, hi, Ridley. Whoa!

41
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:05,924
-Oh dear!
-He's done for!

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,380
Don't worry, Pedro. I'll save you.
[grunts]

43
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:11,512
[Pedro] Whoo!

44
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:12,419
Gotcha.

45
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:15,007
-Go, Ridley!
-Wow. Jurassick.

46
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,933
I'm the queen of the world. Whoo-hoo-hoo!

47
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:20,062
A-plus captaining, Ridley.

48
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,430
And good thing
the museum gave us these tablets.

49
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:25,437
They make rescues
easy as banana cream pie.

50
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,900
I'll see you soon, my yummy friend. Mm.

51
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,532
Hey, Pedro. You okay, little buddy?

52
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:35,029
Yeah. I'm sorry I got stuck on the ice.

53
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,453
I tried to watch where I was going,

54
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,372
but I was feeling sad.

55
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,370
Don't be sad. I love rescuing you.

56
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:44,622
It's not that. I'm sad because I'm moving.

57
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,576
Moving? Well, that's okay.

58
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,206
Exhibits move
around the museum all the time.

59
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,844
Ooh, I hope
they move you to the second floor.

60
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:55,261
They just opened a gender-neutral
bathroom with high-powered hand driers,

61
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,971
and they're awesome.

62
00:02:57,051 --> 00:03:00,221
I'm not sure
if I'm moving to the second floor.

63
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,305
Well, let's ask Mama Penguin.

64
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,770
She'll know exactly
where you're moving to.

65
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:10,059
This should be almost enough boxes
to move all of my snow globes.

66
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,318
-Oh hello, Ridley.
-Hey, Mama Penguin.

67
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,610
Pedro told us about your move,
and we're so happy.

68
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,855
-Can't wait.
-[laughs] Righteous.

69
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:21,487
Mama, where in the museum
are we moving to?

70
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:24,326
Oh, sorry, Pedro. We're not staying here.

71
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:27,172
We're moving
to a different museum across the country.

72
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,128
A different museum?

73
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,249
[gasps] Oh no!

74
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:34,085
But if you're gone, who will be
my favorite boogie board partner?

75
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,842
Who will make us snow cones?

76
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,844
Or frozen bananas.

77
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,546
I can't lose a fellow flightless bird.

78
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:44,677
What will I do without
the second-cutest critter in the museum?

79
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:47,056
As we all know, I am the first cutest.

80
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,813
And Pedro was my first rescue.

81
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:53,856
And my last rescue.
Who will rescue Pedro if I'm not there?

82
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,282
Yeah, who?

83
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,320
Oh baby, I'm sorry.

84
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,113
[cries]

85
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:02,407
Mama, can my friends come with me?

86
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,622
No, mijo. They have to stay here.

87
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:07,122
But your friend Mr. Fish
is coming along for the ride.

88
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,665
Now start packing your nest.

89
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,998
The moving truck should be here soon,
and we don't want to be late.

90
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:16,165
[sighs] I guess I'm really going.
Bye, Ridley.

91
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,676
Pedro, don't worry. We'll save you.

92
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,008
We never give up.

93
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,603
We have to find a way
to get Pedro to stay.

94
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,428
Now that you're all here…

95
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:26,465
Whoops. [chuckles]

96
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,887
…in our living room, what is this about?

97
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,937
Pedro. You can't let him move.

98
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,520
I'm sorry, sweetie.
That's just how traveling exhibits work.

99
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,737
Sometimes they have to move
so other people can enjoy them.

100
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,949
It's hard, but it's part of museum life.

101
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,450
[sighs] There must be something we can do.

102
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:47,123
The best thing you can do now
is help Pedro be ready for his move.

103
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,003
-[clattering]
-That must be the movers.

104
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,370
They probably didn't measure

105
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,666
the polar bear ice sculptures
before moving them. Gotta go.

106
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,802
It's okay, Sunshine. We tried.

107
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,339
We didn't try everything.

108
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,554
We've got to keep Pedro in the museum,

109
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,594
and I know just how to do it.

110
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,514
Listen up, Eyes. Here's the plan.

111
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,677
Ismat, you're with me on stickers.

112
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:11,096
Dante and Peaches, you're on glue duty.

113
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,395
Fred and Dudley, you're on decoy.

114
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:14,479
Everybody ready?

115
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,114
-Right.
-Roger that.

116
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,280
Operation Stop Pedro's Move is a go.

117
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,950
Eyes on three. One, two…

118
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,110
Eyes!

119
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,827
All the boxes with stickers on them
need to go in the moving truck.

120
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,247
[mysterious music plays]

121
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,094
Lift with your tiny arms, Dante.

122
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,973
Totes. [grunting]

123
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:47,009
They'll never be able to move this box
now that it's covered in glue.

124
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:49,016
Fred and Dudley, you're up.

125
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,600
And they'll think this is Pedro?

126
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,606
You bet your hoof they will. See?

127
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,609
[imitating Pedro]
Hey. It's me, Pedro. Really.

128
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,492
Oh, hi, Pedro, do you want to--

129
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:04,949
Wait a second.
It worked. I was totally fooled.

130
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,121
[laughs]

131
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,909
Told you. Take us home, Ismat and Ridley.

132
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,290
Piece of cake. Let's move in.

133
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,759
[humming]

134
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:21,798
Oh.

135
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,301
[humming]

136
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,883
Huh? Uh, what?

137
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:28,177
Oh! Hey! Hey! Don't move me!

138
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:29,512
We did it, team.

139
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:32,427
Pedro is going to stay
in the museum forever.

140
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,227
-We rule!
-Totes.

141
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,650
Hey, this penguin is full of rocks.

142
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,649
[grunts]

143
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:39,691
We got it.

144
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,404
[blubbering]

145
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,244
[chuckles]
Sorry, I thought you were a box.

146
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,620
Would a box
have a gorgeous mustache like this?

147
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:51,947
Well, I guess
we celebrated a bit too soon.

148
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:54,246
It's okay.
The moving truck isn't here yet.

149
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,670
There's still time to…

150
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,958
-[vehicle approaching]
-[sighs] Never mind.

151
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:03,966
Hey, Ridley,
can I stay in the museum forever now?

152
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:07,508
[sighs] No. I'm so sorry, Pedro.

153
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,303
We tried, but there's nothing we could do.

154
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,218
You were my first rescue,

155
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:15,436
but I couldn't save you
this one last time, and…

156
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,767
Whoa. Normally bubble wrap is so fun,

157
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,515
but today it's mega sad.

158
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:25,145
We're never gonna see Pedro again. [cries]

159
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,986
But I don't want to go.

160
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:30,322
[cries]

161
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,158
I don't want you to go either.

162
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,163
Ridley, can we talk for a second?

163
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:37,495
I know this is hard,
but do you know who it's harder for?

164
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,212
Than me? No.

165
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,922
-I'm totally broken up over Pedro moving.
-[cries]

166
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,594
But… [sighs]

167
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:45,922
…so is Pedro.

168
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:49,887
That's right, and he has to face
being scared of going someplace new.

169
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,259
That's awful.

170
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:55,515
What he needs is his friends
to support him with his big move.

171
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,980
You're right, Mama.
And I know just what to do.

172
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:05,568
Mama Penguin said I'd be okay,
but I'm not okay, Mr. Fish.

173
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,111
They can't move us if they can't find us.

174
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:14,117
Pedro? We've got a surprise for you.

175
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:17,462
Oh, I worked my hooves off
to make the perfect goodbye cake

176
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,958
with delicious fish paste.

177
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,461
Oh, Pedro is going to love it.

178
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:25,213
Yeah, but where is the little guy?

179
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,086
Pedro? Pedro?

180
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:31,425
Ay, Pedro ran away.
All he left was this note.

181
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,681
"I don't want to move,

182
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,772
so I ran away
where no one would ever find me."

183
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,308
-[all gasp]
-Oh no.

184
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:39,981
If I didn't want anyone to find me,

185
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:43,861
I'd hide next to the feather duster
because we look like twins, see?

186
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,940
-Ah.
-I see it.

187
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,654
-Twinsies.
-Perfect resemblance.

188
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:49,864
I've saved Pedro enough times
to know where he's hiding.

189
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,656
The place where we had
our first adventure together.

190
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,660
The Serengeti. Come on.

191
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,202
-Whoo-hoo!
-Let's do this.

192
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,540
-Well, this looks familiar.
-[cries]

193
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,672
Stay still, Pedro.
We're gonna come save you.

194
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:06,590
No. If there's one thing
I've learned from today,

195
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,801
it's that me and Mr. Fish
need to save ourselves.

196
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,052
-It's the only way.
-[rumbling]

197
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,474
Whoa!

198
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,973
[screams]

199
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,224
Don't worry, Pedro. I've got you.

200
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,016
-[adventurous music plays]
-Ah!

201
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,140
-Ah.
-Huh.

202
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,187
Thanks for saving me, Ridley.

203
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,401
My pleasure.

204
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,150
Pedro, I'm sorry
for making you sad earlier.

205
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,193
I was so focused on my feelings

206
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,527
that I didn't stop
to think about how you feel.

207
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:35,952
I just want you to know
that I'm here for you, now and always.

208
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,543
-Really?
-Really.

209
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:41,828
We'll always be friends.
Moving can never change that.

210
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,884
We can write and call and visit.

211
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,129
I'd like that.

212
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,550
I'd like that, too.

213
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:51,758
No matter what happens,
we'll be friends wherever we are.

With you by my side, I can do anything.

We're so excited
about your big move, Pedro.

You're gonna love it at your new museum.
I hear they just got a T. rex exhibit.

Pedro, before you go,
I've got something special for you.

It's loaded up with the latest

so you can talk to us whenever you want.

Wow! Thanks, Ridley.

240
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:30,272
And before I go, I want you to have this.

Mr. Fish? Really?

00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:36,449
Really. If you ever need saving,
he'll be there for you. [chuckles]

I'll always remember you, friend.

Okay, Mama. Bye, everyone.

Hi, Ridley. Are you busy?

250
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,263
Uh, I'm a little busy. [chuckles]

251
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:00,973
But I always have time for you.

252
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:05,523
Good. I'm having so much fun
in my new museum. I even met the T. rex.

Oh no. Do you need saving?

255

No, Rexy is nice. She's just really loud.

256
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,240
Anyway, my museum has lots of cool stuff,

257

like a lucha libre exhibit
and hoop dancers and a room full of cats

258
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:25,371
and a tank full of great chopper sharks.

259
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,163
Lots of cool stuff.
