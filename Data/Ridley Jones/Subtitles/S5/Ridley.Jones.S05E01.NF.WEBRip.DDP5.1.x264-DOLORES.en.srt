Get along, horsies.

25
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:19,787
It was, like, a Cretaceously good idea
to shrink us all down

26
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:23,291
and hide the Heart of the Museum
in the miniature Old West.

27
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:26,594
That was all Ridley.
She's brighter than Antares.

28
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:30,669
Thanks. Once I realized I had
many more powers as a full protector,

29
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,587
I figured I'd use them.

30
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:38,095
I'm glad the renovations are finally done
and we can put the Heart where it belongs.

31
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,811
Me too. But we better hurry to get back.

32
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,312

00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:43,983

00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,772
That's never a good sign.

35
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:48,565
I have a bad feeling about this.

36
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,240
Dudette, so do I.

37
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:53,818
But I think my bad feeling
is 'cause your horse

38
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,445
is standing on my tail.

39
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,872

Ow, ow, ow, ow.

41
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,540
Sh! I hear something.

42
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:02,753
Wait here.

43
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,291

Um, tell me everything's okay out there.

47
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,891
What's the mission report, Sunshine?

48
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,810

52
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,398
Bandits. Thieves of the Old West.

53
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:36,195
Meaner than a snake
and smellier than a mule on Sunday.

54
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,621
Hide your purties and your shinies.

55
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,490
The only shiny that matters
is the Heart.

56
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,788
We can't let bandits steal our Heart.

57
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,082
I have a plan.

58
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,535
Ma, Pa, and Eyes, you head west.

59
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,295
Mama, you and I
will head east with the Heart.

60
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:52,878
You have to ride
at the Bandits and stall.

61
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:55,934
-That'll give us time to get away.
-Let's do this.

62
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,549
See you on the other side. Yah!

63
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:02,346
Those Jones women are heroes.

64
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,352
True that.

65
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:07,233
Let's get this stampede going.
We got some interfering to do.

66
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:11,232
-Don't have to tell us twice. Yee-haw!
-Yee-haw!

67
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:15,066
G-forces are easier
on my behind than all this bouncing.

68
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:19,243
I hear you, P-dawg, but if those bandits
get a hold of the Heart,

69
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,534
we lose our ability to come to life.

70
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,158
-So bounce away.
-Whoa!

73
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,630
Hm. Mama, you take the Heart.

74
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,672
Ridley, what are you going to do?

75
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,546
I'll draw them away from you.

76
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,803
No, Ridley. That's too dangerous.

77
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,795
Mama, we're protectors.
Danger comes with the job.

78
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,308
Besides, I got this. Yah!

79
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:48,897
No! My hat!
I've had it on all my missions.

80
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,938
I got it. Ha ha!

81
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:53,782
-Nice catch.
-I've still got some moves.

82
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:56,988
Remember, it's not the hat
that makes the adventurer.

83
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,070
It's the heart beating beneath it.

84
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:01,485
And you have
the strongest heart I know.

85
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:02,954
Thanks, Mama.

86
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:05,254
-Now be careful, my love.
-Of course.

87
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,868
Careful is my middle name.

88
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,499
Which, you know it isn't,
because you named me.

89
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,463
But I'll be careful, Mama. I promise.

90
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:15,554
Now, go. Keep the Heart safe.

but the sun's a-settin'.

comes with some cool perks.

and even get small enough
to see Ma and Pa eye to eye.

-We did.

for the celebration wall.

Oh, this is beautiful.

00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:00,856
Thanks, Eyes.

168
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:05,568
I'll put it right next to this one
of Sarah as a young protector in training.

169
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,321
Wait, that's not Mama's usual hat.

170
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:12,244
No, that was
her old lucky adventurer's hat.

171
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,655
She wore it so much, it fell apart.

172
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:19,294
I can't believe it's been 35 years
since we expanded the museum

173
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,793
to include this tree.

174
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:24,625
And for 35 years,
it's held the Heart of the Museum.

175
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,842
Today, we reopen it.

176
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:31,393
Today, I also resign
as a protector of the museum.

177
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,179
-What?
-You can't!

178
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:38,852
As much as I love protecting the place
I've dedicated my, well, whole life to,

179
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:39,765
it's time.

180
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:43,059
Time for me to hang up my hat for good.

181
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,687
Mama, why?

182
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,074
You saw me out there.

183
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,490
I don't have the jones for adventure
like you do.

184
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,410
Not anymore, anyway.

185
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:54,869
Maybe I was never that good. Not like you.

186
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:56,329
Mama…

187
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,369
What happened out there?

188
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:00,874
Mama chose to save me over the Heart.

189
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,577
She thinks she can't
be a protector anymore.

190
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,708
Oh, she just needs a reminder.

191
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,795
A reminder? Of what?

192
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,720
Of how good she was. And is. Sarah?

193
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,510
Sarah, wait.

194
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:16,434
I can't imagine my mom
not being a protector.

195
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:19,484
I mean, look at us.
We made such a great team.

196
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,939
Shame.
She's the greatest protector I know.

197
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:26,318
No insult intended
to present company.

198
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,609
[laughs] None taken.

199
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,742
I've always wanted
to be half as good as she is.

200
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,490
She was fearless.
Oh, and the best leader.

201
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,294
If only we could remind her of that.

202
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,498
We can. I know we can.

203
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,959
What was Mama's greatest adventure?

204
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:46,419
-Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
-I don't know. What are you thinking?

205
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:51,342
That socks should come in pairs of threes,
so when you lose one you still have two?

206
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,974
Whoa. Mind blown.

207
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:57,891
I know your mom's greatest adventure.
It was ours too.

208
00:09:58,472 --> 00:09:59,682
There it is.

209
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,015
-Mummazing.
-That takes me back.

210
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:06,311
-What am I looking at?
-Scars. From a really scary fire.

211
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,727
This is how we first became a team.

212
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,066
And joined your most righteous mama.

213
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:14,992
[sighs]
I remember it like it was yesterday.

214
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:17,532
[Ismat] Everyone gathered here

215
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:22,037
to watch the tree's inauguration,
celebrating its addition to the museum.

216
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:25,921
[Fred] We weren't a herd yet,
or even friends, like we are now.

217
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,130
-Ah!
-Dude!

218
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,539
[chuckles]

219
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:35,973
[Dante] But in the middle of the ceremony,
some gnarly lightning

220
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:39,142
from the weather exhibit,
like, struck the tree.

221
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,351
[Dudley] And then it caught on fire.

222
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:44,189
[Ismat] The museum was in total chaos.

223
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,648
[Peaches] Your mama was trying solo.

224
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,649
[Fred] And we didn't
like each other that much.

225
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:53,692
[Peaches] In a moment of pure bravery,
instead of trying to escape,

226
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,448
your mama ran into the flame.

227
00:10:58,574 --> 00:10:59,744
-Oh no!
-Goodness.

228
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:05,124
[Ismat] And she came out all singed
and covered in ash,

229
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,496
holding the Heart of the Museum.

230
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:11,003
[Fred] The hot metal from the Heart
gave her that scar,

231
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,667
but she didn't care.

232
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:16,255
[Dante] That inspired us to, like,
come together as a team.

233
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,972
And with Sarah leading us, we got
all the dudes and dudettes

234
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,394
out of harm's way.

235
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:24,602
[Peaches]
Our team was forged in the flame,

236
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,734
and we saved the museum that day.

237
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:30,395
Wow. Forged in the flame.

238
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:33,111
See? Mama is a brave adventurer.

239
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:36,992
If we can just remind her
of what it felt like in that moment

240
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,411

[gasps]

261
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,269
-Eyes Team, huddle up.
-What is it, Ridley?

262
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:49,388
As a full protector,
I have new powers, remember?

263
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:53,727
-Including going back in time.
-Why would you want to do that?

264
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:56,864
I don't know about you,
but I hated seventh grade.

265
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:01,032
If I use my Compass Eye
on this photo of Mom and the tree,

266
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:04,453
we could go back to borrow
Mama's lucky adventurer's hat.

267
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:08,413
As soon as she puts it on,
I know she'll change her mind.

268
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,406
Time travel? [chuckles]

269
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:14,588
Isn't that kinda sorta extremely risky?

270
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:18,628
This astronaut only learned a little
about the time-space continuum,

271
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:20,804
but if there's one thing I do know,

272
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:24,803
it's that going back can mess up
all sorts of stuff in the present

273
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,177
and the future.

274
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,723
Afraid it's too reckless, Sunshine.

275
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:32,598
And this is coming from someone
who jumps into black holes.

276
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:35,106
Yeah. I guess you're right.

277
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:38,609
Let's go figure out a way
to at least cheer your mama up.

278
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:41,032
Hm. I bet she'd love a bag of birdseed.

279
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,990
I can do this. I know I can.

280
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,700
I mean, they made me a protector.

281
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:49,584
I have the power. So why not use it?

282
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,040
I'll be back before anyone knows I'm gone.

283
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:56,844
Okay, past, here I come! Whoa!

284
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:58,915
Whoa!

285
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:05,640
Whoa. It's the museum,
but everything looks kind of old.

286
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,559
Huh. Guess I'm in the past.

287
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,678
Mom, have you seen my lucky hat?

288
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:12,635
Oh, you lost it again?

289
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:16,606
[gasps]
That's Mama and Grandma from the past.

290
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,569
[gasps] And there's Mama's lucky hat.

291
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,282
[grunts]

292
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,818
Yes! [gasps]

293
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:26,277
[grunts]

294
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:31,748
[grunts]

295
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,253
I did it.

296
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:39,462
Sorry, hat. I'll return you as soon
as Mama feels like a hero again.

297
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,755
[grunts]

298
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,715
Back in the present.

299
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:50,223
But where is everyone?

300
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,806
Mama? Grandma?

301
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,725
Anyone know why it's so dark in here?

302
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:57,645
Hm.

303
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,483
Mama, are you in here?

304
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:05,197
Did Mama and Grandma
give the tree house a makeover?

305
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,109
Everything looks so different--

306
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:10,117
-Whoa! Mr. P?
-[woman] Who's there?

307
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,240
-Intruder!
-Don't move!

308
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,748
Uh, got to go. [grunts]

309
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,084
[grunts]

310
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,415
Someone's broken into the museum.

311
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,589
-Who are those guys?
-[tires squeal]

312
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,841
-Hi?
-Come with me if you want to leave.

313
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,886
Uh, who are you?

314
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:31,059
There's no time. Get in, Sunshine.

315
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,638
-"Sunshine"?
-[man] Hey!

316
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,599
[grunts]

317
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,654
We'd better alert Mr. Peabody.

318
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:45,193
That should keep those guards
from bothering us, Sunshine.

319
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,947
You called me "Sunshine" again.
Who are you?

320
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,370
Who am I?

321
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,237
Just your friendly neighborhood

322
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:55,326
space monkey-slash-leader
of the museum resistance.

323
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:58,372
Well, leader and only member.

324
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:01,207
Peaches? I'm so glad it's you.

325
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:04,923
Always nice to see you.
But what on Mars are you doing here?

326
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,585
This is no place for kids.

327
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:10,014
No place for kids? This is a kids' museum.

328
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:16,144
Well, sure, but a museum owned
and controlled by Peabody, remember?

329
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,812
[beeps, crackles]

330
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:18,853
[grunts]

331
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:23,935
I know you been away for a while,
so let me kindly jostle your memory.

332
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,784
When Peabody took over,

333
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:29,449
he kicked your family
out of the tree house and moved in.

334
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,530
He forced Mama and Grandma
to work in the gift shop,

335
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:36,746
fired Lonny, and replaced her
with a heartless security firm.

336
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:40,119
The worst part?
Peabody locks up the exhibits at night.

337
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,497
Everyone is trapped.

338
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,713
That means no playing together,
no exhibit sleepovers,

339
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:47,665
no Rotundas concerts, nothing.

340
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:50,426
No. Why didn't the team stop this?

341
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,679
Team? What team?

342
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:56,351
Fred, Dante, Dudley, Ismat,
and you, Peaches.

343
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,682
You formed a team
when Mama was little.

344
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:02,477
No. We didn't. We were never a team.

345
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,823
What? Oh no.

346
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:07,528
And I hate to hand you a brown banana,

347
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:11,529
but your mama never really
became the protector we hoped she'd be.

348
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:14,493
-She never stood up to Peabody.
-[beeps]

349
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:15,775
I…

350
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,998
I don't believe you.
Mama loves the museum,

351
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,789
and she'd do
whatever it takes to protect it.

352
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,464
Uh… really?

353
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,092
Peaches, will you take me to my mom?

354
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,010
-Mama?
-Ridley?

355
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:35,012
You're supposed to be at boarding school.

356
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:37,765
Boarding school? Since when do I go to…

357
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:41,637
Oh. Right. I go to boarding school.

358
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:45,807
Um… I just had to come and see…

359
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,228
-Wait, let me see your hand.
-What?

360
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,987
-What happened to the scar you got?
-Scar? What scar?

361
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,701
When the Jones family tree caught on fire.

362
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,992
I don't know what scar,

363
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,076
but I do remember that fire.

364
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:02,831
The tree was struck by lightning,
and everyone was so scared.

365
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:06,335
But you went in
and saved the Heart of the Museum, right?

366
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:10,048
What? Run into a fire? No, thanks.

367
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,760
Plus, I couldn't find my lucky hero's hat.
Too risky.

368
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:18,312
So without your hat,
you didn't go into the fire?

369
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:21,388
And never inspired
everyone to join your team.

370
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:24,685
You shouldn't be here.
Mr. Peabody won't like it.

371
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,150
And he's the boss, so what he says goes.

372
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:30,281
Oh. Okay. Sure.

373
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,609
Soon as I'm done,
I'll drive you back to school.

374
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:36,365
I'll just wait outside then.

375
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,081
Hm.

376
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:39,789
-[twinkling]
-Huh?

377
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:41,908
[gasps]

378
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:44,665
Everyone is disappearing from the photo.

379
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:47,918
Does that mean
when I took Mama's hat from the past,

380
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:51,921
I somehow messed everything up
and the team never came together?

381
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:54,005
I have to set things right.

382
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:57,971
But first, I got to get out of here.
Can you help me escape?

383
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,851
You bet your stars I can.

384
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:01,891
Thanks.

385
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:06,314
It was good to see you, Ridley.
We sure miss you around here.

386
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,515
I'll be back. I promise.

387
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:11,725
Copy that. Now, let's peel out.

388
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:15,451
There it is.

389
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:18,779
That vehicle
that's always dropping banana peels.

390
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,786
Just try and catch me. Whoo-hoo!

391
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,579
Thanks, Peaches.
I promise, once I'm done with the past,

392
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,086
you won't be protecting the museum alone.

393
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:34,881
-[woman] Hold on over there!
-[gasps] Oh come on, portal. Open.

394
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,045
[grunting]

395
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,683
Come on! Ah!

396
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,351
[grunts]

397
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:47,477
Okay, everything changed
when I took Mama's lucky hat.

398
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:52,021
So all I need to do is return you,
and everything should go back to normal.

399
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,027
Right?

400
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:56,318
No way. You found my lucky hero's hat.

401
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:57,783
Oh. Yup.

402
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:01,743
I, uh… I saw it in the museum,
so I came to give it back.

403
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:05,245
Thanks. I could've used this earlier.
You won't believe it.

404
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,709
-This tree caught on fire.
-What?

405
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,250
[gasps] That's not good.

406
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:13,004
I didn't have my hat, and I totally froze.

407
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:15,586
Lucky my mom showed up… eventually.

408
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,512
No, no, no, I'm too late.

409
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:20,931
The fire already happened. What do I do?

410
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:21,851
Hm…

411
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,809
You look kind of familiar. Do I know you?

412
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,560
I'm, uh…

413
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,562
also a Jones woman.

414
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:32,154
A distant cousin of yours. Just visiting.
My name's Ridley.

415
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,981
Ridley, huh? That's a cool name.
Have to remember that.

416
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:39,028
Anyway, nice to meet you finally.
I'm Sarah.

417
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:43,582
And no big deal,
but I'm a protector in training.

418
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:47,499
Well, you know
what every future protector needs?

419
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:50,749
A great team to lead. We should form one.

420
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:54,382
Nah. I work better alone.
A team would just slow me down.

421
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:57,421
No way. Having a team is the best.

422
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,126
At least give it a try.

423
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,966
I know just the right museum folks
for the job.

424
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:02,932
-Whoa!
-[gasps]

425
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,465
-Phew!
-Whoo! Thanks for the catch.

426
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:10,266
No problem. Sometimes it helps
to have someone by your side.

427
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,562
Huh. Maybe you're right.

428
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,065
I'll see how I like it.
Who did you have in mind?

429
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:20,781
Dudley the Dodo? Are you sure?

430
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:23,322
Isn't he afraid of everything?

431
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:24,947
Not everything.

432
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:29,453
Just spiders, the outdoors,
and clowns, and starfish,

433
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:34,668
his own shadow, and teddy bears.
Okay, he's afraid of a lot of things.

434
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:38,131
-But he's the most loyal friend I know--
-Friend?

435
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:42,093
I mean,
that's what I've heard about him anyway.

436
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,546
Hello? Dudley?

437
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,176
Ah! Who's there?

438
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:48,893
Oh, hi, Sarah. And you are…?

439
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,734
A long-lost Jones cousin?

440
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:56,900
We're forming a team to go on adventures
with, and Ridley here suggested you.

441
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:57,982
Ah!

442
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,816
Not adventures!

443
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:00,781
Oh! Oh!

444
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:05,621
Everything outside of my exhibit
is dangerous and extinction-inducing.

445
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:08,159
I don't want to go the way of the dodo!

446
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:10,995
Plus, a team led by Sarah Jones?

447
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:13,249
She's not "leadership material."

448
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,752
This is coming from someone
wearing a colander on his head.

449
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,165
And what's the colander for?

450
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,844
For protection.

451
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:23,762

469
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:25,152
Hm.

470
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:29,951
Every leader and hero
has to start somewhere.

471
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:32,493
A journey doesn't start at the end.

472
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:36,787
Anyway, I think if you gave her a chance,
she might surprise you.

473
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:40,003
And I know the outside world
can seem scary,

474
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:43,205
but with friends to look out for us,
we're protected,

475
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:46,836
which allows us to be brave
and face our fears.

476
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:50,215
Oh, really? I could have friends?

477
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:53,893
Uh-huh. Friends who will love you
just the way you are.

478
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,604
So, what do you say?

479
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:59,518
-Let's dodo-do it.
-[chuckles]

480
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,192
[panting]

481
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:10,952
This is a lost cause, Ridley.
Everyone knows Winifred stampedes alone.

482
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,992
[chuckles] I see why.

483
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:16,456
I don't know how much longer
my dodo legs can take this.

484
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:19,538
Winifred? Don't you mean Fred? Fred!

485
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,751
-What did you just say?
-Fred?

486
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:24,795
[snorts] How'd you know
I wanted to be called Fred?

487
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,800
You just look like a Fred to me.

488
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:31,472
Oh good. My parents named me Winifred,
but it never felt right.

489
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:35,973
I think Fred is much more
of a big, tough bison name.

490
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:40,347
Well, big, tough Fred,
we're here to ask you to join our team.

491
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:43,227
No, sorry. I stampede by myself.

492
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:47,185
No one in my herd understands me.
Why would you be any different?

493
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:48,737
Well, you got us there.

494
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,410
We might as well
head back to the rotunda.

495
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,280
[panting]

496
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:56,156
Thank the dodo heavens. [whimpers]

497
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:58,084
Wait! Fred!

498
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:02,673
Look, sometimes our true herd
isn't the one we're born into.

499
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,541
It's the one we choose.

500
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:05,708
Hm.

501
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:08,835
Well, if you're a part of the herd.

502
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:12,684
-Uh, what'd you say your name was again?
-Ridley.

503
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,181
Oh. You look like a Ridley.

504
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:19,983
Anyway, if you're a part of it,
then I guess I'm in. [snorts]

505
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,650
-Now let's move out, folks.
-Whoo-hoo!

506
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:25,609
Please don't make me run anymore!

507
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:29,530
So, who's next to join our, um, team?
[chuckles]

508
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:30,651
[clattering]

509
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:31,777
Like, ow!

510
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,323
Dante, are you okay?

511
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:35,116
Uh, ouch. [chuckles]

512
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,120
Yup. I'm fine.

513
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,791
Just another wipeout.

514
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,159
Luckily, Ralph and I are pretty tough.

515
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:42,117
You got to be more careful.

516
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,457
Careful, huh?
No one's ever said that to me before.

517
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,554
Seems like a totes wise idea.

518
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:51,295
I know you probably like skating alone,

519
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,763
but we wanted to ask you to join our team.

520
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:58,313
See, when we open up our hearts
and let others in--

521
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,770
Sure. I'll join. Sounds fun.

522
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:03,100
Oh. Okay. Great.

523
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:05,306
-Well, that was easy.
-[piano plays]

524
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:08,317
Where's that inspirational music
coming from?

525
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,320
Whoops.

526
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,901
-[chuckles] That's me.
-Righteous! [laughs]

527
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,907
What? Ah! Ah!

528
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,029
This is so scary!

529
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,365
Oh! Oh! Ooh!

530
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:19,289
But also kind of fun.
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

531
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:20,659
[laughing]

532
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:21,955
-Come on!
-[laughing]

533
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:24,998
Wait, shouldn't we be heading
to the space wing?

534
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,923
You said you wanted to see
Peaches the Astronaut.

535
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:31,973
She doesn't spend much time there anymore.
You can usually find her

536
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:34,052
here.

537
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:41,925
Ma, Pa, one more banana milkshake, please.

538
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:45,057
-Sure thing.
-Put something in the tip jar.

539
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:48,855
We ain't running this here saloon
out of charity.

540
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,860
No. [sighs]

541
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,744
She looks so sad.

542
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:56,321
Word around the museum is

543
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:59,616
Peaches has a secret fear
that became too much for her.

544
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:02,371
She stopped going up into space.

545
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,294
[gasps] Secret fear.

546
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:05,622
Wait here.

547
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:08,127
Hey, Peaches, is it?

548
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:09,839
Who wants to know?

549
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,589
A friend. One you haven't met yet.

550
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:15,182
I'm Ridley. Ridley Jones.

551
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:18,888
What can I do for you, Ridley Jones?

552
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:23,350
This might just be a hunch,
but are you afraid of heights?

553
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:24,483
Sh!

554
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,439
The walls have ears.

555
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:30,019
Listen, I used to be able
to overcome my fears

556
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:34,066
and go on space missions
with my friend Sylvia Jones.

557
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,112
Oh, she was the bravest.

558
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,946
And it made me brave too.

559
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:43,118
But in the years since,
my fear has gotten the better of me.

560
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,463
Everything seems scarier now.

561
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:48,748
Even Sarah over there
froze during the fire today.

562
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:54,301
We all have fears,
but we don't have to face them solo.

563
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:57,721
Like you said, Grandma-- I mean, Sylvia

564
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,091
made you brave.

565
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:02,597
Sarah can too.
I think if you joined our crew,

566
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,101
we could help you
get your stuff back.

567
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,773
-[chuckles]
-Order up.

568
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:09,941
Keep it. I've got permission for takeoff!

569
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:13,901
What? After all the work we just did?

570
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:15,403
Oh, sorry.

571
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:19,071
We're the size of a spoon, you know.

572
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:22,906
I can't believe this is actually working.

573
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:27,792
Which is good, because I have to get this
team together and save the museum quick.

574
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:30,419
Okay, team. Just one member to go.

575
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,090
-Who is it?
-Ismat.

576
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:34,248
-What?
-Queen Ismat?

577
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:35,627
Um, yeah.

578
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,424
Queen Ismat the Irritable?

579
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:38,587
The Terrible?

580
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:42,795
-The cranky-first-thing-in-the-morning?
-And last thing at night?

581
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:46,637
And also all the other times? That Ismat?

582
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,225
-Mm-hm. Let's go.
-[Fred] Are you kidding?

583
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:56,034
Now that I've got my lucky hat back,
I'm totally not scared of anything.

584
00:28:56,109 --> 00:29:00,239
But if I were scared of something,
it'd be the mummy queen.

585
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:02,121
-Mm-hm.
-What? Come on.

586
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:06,698
Ismat might have her queenly moments,
but she's not someone to be afraid of.

587
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:10,036
-[screams] Uh-oh.
-Intruders! Intruders! Intruders!

588
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,123
You were saying?

589
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:12,917
Um, hi.

590
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:18,669
I told you, we're not intruders.
We're friends of the queen.

591
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,177
Ha! A likely story.

592
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,928
[laughs] The queen has no friends.

593
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,138
Silence.

594
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:27,965
We now present our queen,

595
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:32,847
Queen Ismat Chione
Jomana Edrice Khepri the Great…est.

596
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:36,267
-Bowing. Bowing. Bowing.
-Not looking at her in the eyes.

597
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:37,607
Thanks, Dads.

598
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:42,242
Now, who dares trespass
on this royal mummy's

599
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:45,162
sacred and tastefully-decorated domain?

600
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:46,871
Please, Your Highness?

601
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:50,871
We're museum inhabitants
who've traveled to your exhibit

602
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:51,955
to visit you.

603
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:56,540
Visit me? Without gifts or an offering?
[laughs]

604
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,128
Don't make me laugh.

605
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,673
-[snorts] You can have the dodo.
-Hey!

606
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,837
Are you kidding me? [laughs]

607
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,926
That would never go with my decor.

608
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:07,011
[laughing]

609
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:08,555
[clears throat]

610
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,270
[laughing]

611
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:13,060
Come on, Sarah. You got to do something.

612
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,944
Everyone needs your help.

613
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:15,861
[grunts]

614
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:20,358
The intruder! She escaped!

615
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:21,823
-[gasps]
-[grunts]

616
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,446
-Oh!
-[grunts]

617
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:27,873
[grunts]

618
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:29,828
Yes!

619
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:34,326
Don't move,
unless you want your queen pokified.

620
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:36,995
-[gasps]
-Um, sorry about this.

621
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,285
[screams]

622
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,011
Come on.

623
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:46,299
[gasps]
What are you just standing around for?

624
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:49,846
After them. They kidnapped
our sweetums. I mean, the queen.

625
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,641
[all roar]

626
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,642
[gasps] Unhand me, you fool.

627
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:58,817
Without the queen to rule, the kingdom
could fall into complete chaos.

628
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:02,398
And more importantly,
my outfit is getting so wrinkled.

629
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:04,815
-[roaring]
-[Ridley] Go the other way.

630
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:08,489
There they are! Stop them!

631
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:12,245
I promise,
dodo shish kebab is not appetizing.

632
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:13,828
Any more bright ideas?

633
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:17,423
-Um…
-Sarah, just tell Ismat why we're here.

634
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:20,997
I'm sorry we did this.
We just wanted to talk to you.

635
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:24,127
I know what it's like
to have big responsibilities.

636
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:28,295
And a family legacy to uphold.
It can be scary. And overwhelming.

637
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:31,306
If you let your guard down,
and your guards down,

638
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:35,139
and found some friends,
you might find another side of you.

639
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,186
One that isn't so… queenly.

640
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,110
Now that's the mama I know.

641
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:40,654
Ahem.

642
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,109
Now that was a close one.

643
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:47,702
-I thought we were all totes extinct.
-Well, some of us are totes extinct.

644
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,820
True that.

645
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,907
Sarah, you were amazing.

646
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,742
I guess I… I was, huh?

647
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:56,867
Come on, I wasn't gonna do anything
that bad to you all.

648
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:59,166
Just throw you in the dungeon.

649
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,130
Oh, is that it, Princess?

650
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:04,011
It's "Queen." [chuckles]

651
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:07,178
That's the first time
you've said that to each other.

652
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:08,468
[both] Huh?

653
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:10,011
Uh, never mind.

654
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:14,724
Anyway, I'm just glad
you decided to join us, Ismat.

655
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:18,267
Now you're all a team,
with Sarah leading the way.

656
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:21,153
And the present should go back to normal.

657
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,190
What?

658
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,153
Everyone's still disappearing.

659
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,323
But why?

660
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,700
Fred, I told you, hands off the bling.

661
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,320
I just touched it.

662
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:33,786
I am not good with conflict.
I am… Ooh!

663
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:37,458
Oops! Sorry, dodo dude.
What was your name again? Devon?

664
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:40,378
This is why I usually fly solo.

665
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,208
Whoo! [chuckles]

666
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,173
Whoa!

667
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:48,757

-Really?
-Are you kidding?

683
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:54,115
[sighs] I guess my only choice
is to head back

684
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,618
and figure out another way to fix things.

685
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,751
-[crackles]
-[gasps] My Compass Eye. It's broken.

686
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:02,619
Oh no, no, no. This can't be happening.

687
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:05,127
Come on. Work. Please.

688
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,169
Yes!

689
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,631
That's not good.

690
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,514
No way. Is that a Compass Eye?

691
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:13,892
Dude!

692
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:16,848
You didn't say
you were a museum protector too.

693
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:19,099
It must be a pretty tough job, huh?

694
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:22,892
I mean, a tough job for you.
I'm gonna be great at it.

695
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,647
Must have slipped my mind.

696
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:27,319
Oh. It looks totally busted.

697
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:29,528
Yeah. It got broken somehow.

698
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:32,449
And I need to fix it
before I go back home,

699
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:37,078
to a house which exists in this same time,
and not in the future or anything.

700
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,738
That's some purty fancy metalwork.

701
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:43,497
You're gonna need a top-notch
blacksmith to fix it, Sunshine.

702
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:48,421
Sure, but where am I gonna find
a blacksmith at a time like this?

703
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:51,263
-[humming]
-Oh. Right. Hey, Ida.

704
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:54,799
Hm. So it's completely broken.

705
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:57,684
Well, when I hit it enough, it does this.

706
00:34:58,888 --> 00:34:59,928
Zounds!

707
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:03,434
It is as I feared.
This Compass Eye must be reforged.

708
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:07,438
Reforged?
Well, if anyone can do it, Ida, it's you.

709
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:10,532
Hm. Yes,
I might be capable of such a feat.

710
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:13,648
Melting down the metal
so it can be reshaped.

711
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:17,196
I must warn you the heat
of my exhibit shall not be enough.

712
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:23,251
I must forge your Compass Eye
in that dinosaur's volcano.

713
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:26,209
Oh, the volcano that's right over there?

714
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:31,500
For a second, I thought you were gonna
say somewhere far away and dangerous.

715
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:35,377
No, no, no, no, not this replica
made of rubber and plastic.

716
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,796
The real one. Here.

717
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,140
-[all] Whoa!
-[Ismat] O-M-Egypt!

718
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,722
That's a lot of smoke.

719
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:43,977
And lava.

720
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:45,268
And magma.

721
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:48,401
Yeah. This might technically
be part of my exhibit,

722
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:51,439
but I avoid the real volcano
as much as possible,

723
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:55,324
on account of, you know,
how totally gnarly and aggro it is.

724
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:59,623
Ida, are you sure we can't just slap
a Band-Aid on the Compass Eye

725
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:00,949
and call it a day?

726
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:02,243
Alas, I fear not.

727
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:08,456
An item as rare and magical such as this
must be forged in the flame.

728
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,461
Forged in the flame.

729
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:12,093
[gasps] This is it.

730
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,960
Like the tree catching fire,

731
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:18,006
this mission could put the Compass Eye,
Mama, and the team together.

732
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:22,102
Don't worry, Sarah.
If we work as a team, we can do this.

733
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,100
Uh-huh.

734
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:27,644
Now that we've divvied up
all my blacksmith tools,

735
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:30,807
we must make haste
for the top of the volcano.

736
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:34,897
There, I shall set up my station
near the hottest lava and embers.

737
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:38,744
Wow. Up close,
this place looks even scarier.

738
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:40,871
It looks like an adventure.

739
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,740
One I can handle all by myself.

740
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:47,576
Wait, no.
This volcano is super dangerous.

741
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:49,793
And plus, Ida has so much gear,

742
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,174
we need the whole team
to carry it up.

743
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:56,631
And speaking of the team,
don't you want to give us a pep talk?

744
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,429
Don't fall in the lava. It's hot.

745
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:05,635
-Great pep talk. Super inspirational.
-[groans]

746
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,893
This might seem
like an impossible mission,

747
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:10,436
but I believe in you.

748
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:13,479
If we do this together
and look out for each other,

749
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,364
we'll reach the summit.

750
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,151
-Let's do this.
-Bisonic!

751
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,242
How are y'all doing back there?

752
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,611
Hanging in there.

753
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:27,447
I don't think these rocks
are dodo friendly!

754
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:29,156
Whoa! Ah!

755
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,077
Dudley!

756
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,424
[screaming]

757
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:35,169
Oh. Peaches, you…
You saved me. Thank you.

758
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,173
That was mighty scary.

759
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:41,045
But I also feel like
I'm getting my right stuff back.

760
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:42,933
Let's make a deal, Dudley.

761
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:46,100
If you ever fall,
I'll be there to catch you.

762
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,220
Always.

763
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:49,346
-You will?
-Of course.

764
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,103
What are friends for?

765
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:54,482
Phew!

766
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:57,355
[rumbling]

767
00:37:57,441 --> 00:38:00,281
-[all] Whoa!
-[Dudley] What's happening?

768
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:04,571
-The volcano, it's about to erupt.
-Then we'd better hurry to the top.

769
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:07,367
We need to wait
and take cover until it's done.

770
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:10,371
You can stay if you want,
but I'm going ahead.

771
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:14,464
-We have to go together.
-Look, I told you I didn't want a team.

772
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:18,212
I said I work better alone
and a team would just slow me down.

773
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,166
And I was right.
I can't keep you all safe.

774
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,507
So deal with it, okay?

775
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:24,932
Sarah, I--

776
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,141
[all] Whoa!

777
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,220
[screaming]

778
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,765
No, we're all gonna fall into the lava.

779
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:34,309
I know you're broken,
but please, please open just this once.

780
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:40,902
Are we all deep-fried dodo?

781
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:43,487
Because I smell barbecue!

782
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:46,451
No, Ridley used her Compass Eye
and saved us.

783
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:48,282
Well, you know what they say.

784
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:51,287
"A broken Compass Eye
is right once a day."

785
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,370
Ah!

786
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:55,575
Uh-oh. This thing is completely destroyed.

787
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,286
We gotta fix it before…

788
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,420
something bad happens.

789
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:01,634
[all] Whoa!

790
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:04,014
[Sarah] Uh, what's going on?

791
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:07,603
That opening I created
with my broken Compass Eye

792
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:11,638
must be raging out of control.
And it brought the outside world in.

793
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,769
[elephant trumpets]

794
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:16,766
[all scream]

795
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:19,614
The museum. The inhabitants. The exhibits.

796
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,230
It'll all be destroyed.

797
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:24,147
Not to mention,
we'll all be lavas who lunch.

798
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:26,276
Only if we don't do something.

799
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,374
We have to fix my Compass Eye

800
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:31,119
and close the portal
before the next eruption.

801
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:34,542
-Ida, do you still have all your tools?
-Indeed.

802
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,872
Great. We'll stay here and reforge it

803
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:40,497
while you and the team
get everyone in the rotunda to safety.

804
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:42,796
But I… I can't.

805
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,340
Everyone is scared and confused.

806
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:48,684
They need you to lead them.

807
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,511
Ridley, I lied.

808
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:52,886
It's not that I haven't wanted a team.

809
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:54,813
I'm scared to have one.

810
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:58,232
What if I screw up
or make a mistake or get someone hurt?

811
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,980
Someone I love getting hurt
or losing them.

812
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,606
That's my biggest fear.

813
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:07,821
I'd rather never be a protector
than be one that fails.

814
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:11,986
Sarah, I know someone
who's a lot like you.

815
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:15,866
She's always worrying
and making sure everyone's safe.

816
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,205
Especially me.

817
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:21,669
And lately, she thinks she's failed
as an adventurer and a protector.

818
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:23,712

Jones women never give up, huh?

844
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:43,575
Okay, team, enough standing around.

845
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:44,957
Let's mobilize.

846
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:47,844
Ridley and Ida will stay
to fix the Compass Eye,

847
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:50,512
and we've got
scared inhabitants out there.

848
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,761
It's our job to save them, okay?

849
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:55,013
-[all] Okay!
-Then come on.

850
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:58,135
-Oh yeah!
-Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

851
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:01,891
Are you ready?

852
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:03,767
Forsooth I am.

853
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,694
I just need a bit of--

854
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:08,437
Aha! Some hot lava.

855
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:12,066
We may begin the smelting process.

856
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:16,334
And as we blacksmiths like to say,
"He who smelt it, dealt it."

857
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:17,328
[both laugh]

858
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:19,999
Hurry, okay? We don't have much time.

859
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:23,171
[adventurous music plays]

860
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:24,956
Whoo!

861

[panting]

862
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,508
[laughs]

863
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:39,096
-We did it, team.
-Hooray!

864
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:41,141
We did. We dodo-did.

865
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:44,055
Houston, we have some safe museum folk.

866
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:46,614
And everything is gonna be all right.

867
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:48,439
[all scream]

868
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,567
Everyone, get to the stairs.

869
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:54,358
Oh no! The Heart of the Museum.

870
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:56,737
Sarah, why aren't you running?

871
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,994
Keep going. I'll be right back.

872
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,117
No. Mama!

873
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:03,003
Ida, please hurry.

874
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:04,369
Almost.

875
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,208
Whoa!

876
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:09,093
[panting]

877
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:10,627
Got it!

878
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,550
Oh no.

879
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:16,588
Mama!

880
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:18,505
[grunts]

881
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,756
-Sarah, grab on.
-Whoa!

882
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,518
[gasps] My lucky hat!

883
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,895
Your lucky hat. It's gone.

884
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,400
It's not such a big deal.

885
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:34,105
You know, I'm starting to think
that it's not the hat

886
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:36,364
that makes the adventurer. It's…

887
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,817
The heart beating beneath it.

888
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:41,117
Oh. I like that second part.

889
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,491
I do too.

890
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:45,122
Oh no! We're trapped!

891
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:47,875
-Hiyah!
-[thunder rumbles]

892
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:52,302
Lady Ridley! Catch! [grunts]

893
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:53,299
[grunts]

894
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:00,509
It… It worked.

895
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:03,466
-We did it!
-Righteous! [laughs]

896
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:06,977
Galactically great work, y'all! We did it!

897
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:08,851
Oh, and we did it together.

898
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:11,317
As a Team. With a capital T.

899
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:13,028
-Yeah!
-A Team.

900
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:14,568
[laughing]

901
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,363
I guess we did do it.

902
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:19,818
-[lemur clears throat] Um…
-Huh?

903
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:23,037
Now that the lava's gone,
can someone help us down?

904
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:26,828
Whoops. That was all my doing.

905
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:30,884
We've got scared, displaced inhabitants
to get back to their homes.

906
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:32,419
-Ready?
-You all go.

907
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:35,843
You've got this.
I know you'll keep the museum safe.

908
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:37,263
-For sure.
-Roger that.

909
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:42,350
Thanks for believing in me, Ridley.
I promise I'll never give up.

910
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:44,717
[chuckles]

911
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:46,774
[chuckles]

912
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:50,354
Thank you, Ridley.

913
00:44:55,859 --> 00:45:00,279
Okay, no bars on the exhibits,
no creepy lighting or security guards.

914
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:01,454
So far, so good.

915
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:06,792
Dudley, the banner can't say,
"Featuring Dudley the Amazing."

916
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,080
What? How come?

917
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:11,713
Because you're not the star
of this celebration, I am.

918
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:15,133
I mean, the tree is.

919
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:18,722
Now I just need to convince Mama
not to retire.

920
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:21,716
But I don't need a lucky hat to do it.

921
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:25,602
The hat doesn't make the hero.
It's the heart beating beneath it.

922
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:28,601
And no one's heart
is stronger than Mama's.

923
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:30,444
I know I can convince her.

924
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:32,771
Mama? Mama?

925
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:34,145
I'm in the kitchen.

926
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:38,861
Mama. Okay. I know you want to retire
and quit being a protector, but I--

927
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:42,164
Retire?
What are you talking about, sweetie?

928
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,869
But you said…

929
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:47,909
Ridley, I'm a Jones woman,
and Jones women never give up.

930
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:50,827
Hurry and eat before we go patrolling.

931
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:55,294
And keep an eye out for Peabody.
He's been acting really suspicious lately.

932
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:59,127
I didn't just fix the future.
I made it even better.

933
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:01,514
-What was that, sweetie?
-Nothing.

934
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:06,143
Oh! What was that for?

935
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:10,851
Just… thanks for always being my hero.
And for never giving up.

936
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:15,614
You're my hero too, Rids.
And I promise I will never give up.

937
