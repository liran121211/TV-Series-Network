[Ridley] Mummy Makeover.

24
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,744
I'm feeling a bit underdressed, y'all.

25
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:19,906
I knew I should've
brought my black-tie space suit.

26
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,286
It's okay, Peaches.

27
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:25,752
You're still cleared and ready for takeoff
in the museum's newest exhibit.

28
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:29,125
Portraits of royalty throughout history.

29
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,054
Thanks, mummy friend.

30
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:33,722
Isn't this exhibit the best?

31
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:37,432
A collection of kings and queens
all in one place.

32
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:42,894
Though something,
or should I say someone, is missing.

33
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:43,807
Me.

00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,015
[all] Jura-sick!

35
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,355
Thanks, everyone.

36
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,979
It's only fitting
that I grace this exhibit

37
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,857
with my queenly presence.

38
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:55,574
[sighs] I just hope I fit in.
They're all so fashionably fabulous.

39
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:58,827
Relax, Ismat.
You're just as royal as they are.

40
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,910
Come on, everyone.
Let's check out the rest of the exhibit.

41
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:06,126
You go ahead.
I have some portrait hanging to do.

42
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:11,419
[chuckles] Young lady,
this exhibit is for royals only.

43
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,216
Right, Queen Victoria?

44
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:16,179
Indubitably, King George. [laughs]

45
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:19,811
Oh. Of course. I mean, why wouldn't it be?

46
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:25,269
I just thought maybe I could hang
a picture here, since I'm a queen too.

47
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,063
[both laugh]

48
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,977
Oh. You're serious.

49
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:32,525
Well, you certainly
don't belong in these hallowed halls.

50
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,280
Look at your common clothes,
your, uh, wraps.

51
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:39,164
Hey, my wraps are sarcophagus chic.

52
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:42,202
Ugh! And your green skin.

53
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,497
Royals can't have green skin?

54
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:50,211
My dear, never in all my painted days
have I seen a green queen.

55
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,705
-You simply can't hang with us.
-[laughs]

56
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:55,177
-Surely not.
-The very thought of it.

57
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:58,048
Oh. I guess I really don't
look like them at all.

58
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,517
Fan sadder, please.

59
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,639
[both groan]

60
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,095
Ismat, is something wrong?

61
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,306
I was going to hang my picture,

62
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:12,106
but the other portraits
don't think I'm royal enough.

63
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,862
-No way.
-Way.

64
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:18,453
I thought I was, but I guess
my clothes and wraps and green skin

65
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:21,241
don't scream "Queen material."

66
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,036
[sighs] Maybe they're right.

67
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:26,579
Maybe it's time I gave myself
a mummy makeover

68
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:29,834
for a new portrait that's more royal.

69
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:34,088
[gasps] I'm thinking accessories.

70
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,302
Any ideas?

71
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,881
-Pearls, dude.
-Scepters.

72
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:37,796
Rubies.

73
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,394
Don't count your mules
before they're washed.

74
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,310
That stuff's scattered
all over the museum.

75
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:46,849
And borrowing them is gonna be
harder than catching a comet by the tail.

76
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,095
I don't care how hard it is.

77
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:53,317
We can do anything
as long as we work together.

78
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,819
-Right, Ridley?
-Yeah.

79
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,701
But do you really need
a bunch of extra royal stuff?

80
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,530
You might look
a little different from the others, Ismat,

81
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,026
but you're still a queen.

82
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,577
Oh, okay.

83
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,711
I guess I didn't need
to join the royals anyway.

84
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,619
Stop the sad fanning.

85
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:13,964

then it's important to us.

86
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,755
-Count me in.
-Really?

87
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,718
Oh, thanks, Ridley.

88
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,425
Okay, Sunshine.

89
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,510
First up on Ismat's list: pearls.

90
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,516
And there's bound
to be a humdinger in one of the clams.

91
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:30,229
Wow. Look at the size of that.

92
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,021
Oh! My dodo heart.

93
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:36,025
[Peaches] Oops, I forgot to mention.
Watch out for Mark the hangry shark.

94
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,359
Dudes, I've got three words for you:

95
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,614
clam fishing.

96
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,066
Okay, maybe two words, but still…

97
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:43,656
Great idea, Dante.

98
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:46,701
We'll use my rope
to lower someone into the tank,

99
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,996
but they'll need to be small and light

100
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,000
so we can reel them up
before they become a shark snack.

101
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:55,303
Who, me? But I don't have my water wings.
[chuckles]

102
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:59,798
Dudley, you've got this.
You're the bravest dodo I know.

103
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:02,222
I'm the only dodo you know.

104
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,892
And I'm the only dodo you'll ever know.

105
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,681
Last of my kind, remember?

106
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:09,524
Yes, but also, one of a kind.

107
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,850

Seriously, Ismat,
you're still a queen no matter what.

You don't need all this stuff.

Um, yeah, I do.

120
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:57,732
If I want to hang with the portraits,
I need to be as royal as royal can be.

we found everything on Ismat's list.

Almost, Sunshine.
Last up is a royal scepter.

123
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:11,002
Ida's guarding it in the armor exhibit,
but I'm sure she'll let you borrow it.

124
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,499
I shan't let you borrow it.

-You shan't?
-Please.

126
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,590
Apologies, but I am sworn
to protect the royal scepter

unless I am bested in combat.

128
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:21,463
Then I challenge you to a duel.

and paint me a brand-new portrait?

Um, minus the green skin.

Wait, what?

Ismat, without your green skin,
your painting won't look like you.

171
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,619
Exactly.
I have to look like the other royals.

172
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,240
And none of those
kings or queens are green.

Presenting Queen Ismat Chione
Jomana Edrice Khepri the Great.

178
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,596
Greetings, fellow royals.

179
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,982
My word. What a pleasant surprise.

180
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:43,811
Now you look like a proper queen.
You simply must join us.

181
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,648
Really? O-M-Ra!

182
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:49,494
I mean, very well, then.

183
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,910
[chuckles] Now that is a royal portrait.

184
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:59,711
Yes, you did a fine job covering up those
dreadful wraps and that greenest of skin.

185
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:00,619
Agreed?

186
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,286
-Oh, absolutely.

Oh, thanks…

I think.

189
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,758
Ismat, aren't you, like,
happy with the new you?

190
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:14,009
Um, of course.
I got everything I wanted, right?

191
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:17,215
And they accepted me.
Then why doesn't this feel good?

That sounds like the fire alarm.

195
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,056
But what could have set it off?

196
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,904
Oh. Fire!

197
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,323
This is not a drill!

Water's a painting's worst enemy.

It'll melt them all away.

203
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:42,665
Not on our watch.
Keep those paintings high and dry.

204

-Peaches, can you turn off the sprinklers?
-You betcha.

208
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:57,353
But I'll need an extra set of hands.
Let's blast off.

Help! I'm too important to melt!

Hold up, I-dog.

211

If you get super soaked,
your wraps will unravel.

212

There's no time to wait.
The paintings are in trouble.

Everything's gonna be all right.

More than okay.
She was positively stupendous.

I've never seen such bravery.

221

Dudes, that's because
Ismat is royally righteous.

222
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,062
And she never, ever gives up.
