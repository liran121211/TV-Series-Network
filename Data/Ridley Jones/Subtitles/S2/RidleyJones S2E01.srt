175
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:45,882
[Mrs. Sanchez] Oh, Dante,
Peaches, stylish as always.

176
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:49,343
And that bow tie, one of a kind.

177
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,637
Just like you, Dudley.

178
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,932
And who is hiding back there?

179
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:59,520
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

180
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:02,023
Is that Fred?

[crowd gasping]

182
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:06,652
Oh, hey. [nervous giggling]
Hi. Uh, just me.

183
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:11,574
Your dress gets a whale-sized yes from me!

184
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,117
[chanting] Fred! Fred! Fred!

185
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:16,078
I bow to your magnificent bow.

186
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:20,249
I have known many a queen,
but none have matched your beauty.

187
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,418
I don't want to be a beauty queen.

188
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,378
I wanna be me.

189
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,797
Well, grits and gravy!

190
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:30,176
I didn't know you could have
a stampede of one, but there you have it.

191
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,386
Oh, great idea.

192
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,847
Let's do The Stampede.

193
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,475
[disco music playing]

194
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:40,019
I, like, don't wanna bring everyone down,

195
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,355
but I don't think
that was a dance Fred was doing.

196
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:45,775
-Then why are you joining in?
-Good question, dude.

197
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,860
We have to go find them.

198
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,530
There you are, Fred.

199
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:51,989
Why'd you run off?

200
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:55,743
Yeah, you cute bison.
Don't tell me you suddenly hate to dance.

201
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:56,786
[groaning] I…

202
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,247
No, seriously. Don't tell me.

203
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,542
Fred, you look as sparkling
as the Sphinx's treasure.

204
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,751
Show it off.

205
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:06,796
The thing is,
I know you think I look good,

206
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,631
but I don't feel good.

207
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,716
You're sick? Is it contagious?

208
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:16,097
No. I mean I don't feel like myself.

209
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,933
This dress, I'm uncomfortable in it.

210
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:20,935
Maybe you need a different size.

211
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:24,355
I hate when they don't have
the right size space suit for me to wear.

212
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,857
No, it's not about how it fits.

213
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,193
It's just not me.

214
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:33,656
I think maybe I dressed you
in what I wanted to wear,

215
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,241
not what you wanted to wear.

216
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:38,202
Sorry, Ismat.
I know you were trying to help.

217
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,787
No, I'm sorry.

218
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,123
Fashion is about feeling good,

219
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:45,293
and feeling good
is about feeling like yourself.

220
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,545
If you don't feel good,
I didn't do my job.

221
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,672
I don't feel like myself.

222
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,507
Why didn't you just tell us?

223
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,302
I was afraid you'd laugh at me.

224
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,679
Dude, why would we laugh at you?

225
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,931
Because of what I want to wear.

226
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,726
It's kind of different.

227
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,270
But that's exactly why we love you, Fred.

228
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:06,981
Because you're different
and not afraid to show it.

229
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:10,484
Come on.
Let's get you ready for the prom your way.

230
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,990
Snazzy!

231
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,450
[Fred] You think?

232
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:18,701
Take a look.

233
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,578
I look good.

234
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:23,497
And I feel good! Oh!

235
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,541
I feel like me.

236
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,627

sounds like a great idea. How 'bout it?

Um, I wish I could, but I have to do
some spring cleaning with my dads.

is the help of a real eggs-pert.

00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,948
Okay, until we know where this goes,

351
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,200
it'll be safest
if it stays in the rotunda.

352
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:55,245
No matter what kind of egg it is,
it's fragile and needs to be protected.

353
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,581
Can I count on you to take care of it

I'll be back as soon as I can.
