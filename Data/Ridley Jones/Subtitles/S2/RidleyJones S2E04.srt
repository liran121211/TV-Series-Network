00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,721
[gasping] Maybe, like, ask it for help.

175
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,473
Uh, worth a try.

176
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,600
Oh, wondrous Compass Eyes,

177
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,643
show me to…

178
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,604
my Compass Eye.

179
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:02,982
Ooh, I know!
Maybe you just need the right outfit.

180
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:06,569
Something that screams,
"Museum protector!"

181
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:10,031
Nah, don't even sweat it.
[grunting] I'll track it down.

182
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:13,284
[calling] Compass Eye, where are you?

183
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,994
Come out, come out and be--

184
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,871
Whoa! [grunting]

185
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:19,040
-[Ismat] Ooh.
-Dante!

186
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,541
[Dante] I'm okay.

187
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,001
[Dante chuckling] Whew.

188
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,961
I'm completely stumped.

189
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:27,715
Maybe, I'm just not cut out
to be a museum protector.

190
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:31,844
[Mr. Peabody] Lonny! I found your badge
in the cafeteria freezer again.

191
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:35,014
-You have to be more careful!
-Mr. Peabody and Lonny!

192
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,390
They're still here?

193
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:40,520
-Everyone, get to your exhibits.
-[Fred] Keep it moo-vin'!

194
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,898
-I could've sworn I heard mooing, again.
-You hear it too?

195
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:47,568
I think it's the fabled phantom cow
that chews its cud in the night.

196
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:48,653
Hello!

197
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:52,865
What's this? I've never seen
anything like these before.

198
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,575
They're beautiful.

199
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,786
So they must be worth a fortune.

That was your evilest chuckle yet, sir.

Hm.

204
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,838
Found my toolbox!
It was also in the freezer.

205
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,925
Nothin' like a set of cool tools.

206
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:17,431

these things are unless I open them and--

Now I know I need to open these up.

219
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,757
What's inside must be really valuable.

220
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,051

This isn't working,

[Lonny] Ooh, I'll bring my power drill.

229

Something's making them open and close,
and open and close, and open and--

-Uh, you get it.
-I do.

237
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,972
And it can't be good.

The back wall to the Serengeti

are a-coming!

244
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:02,828
and a sandstorm
came blowing into the museum!

-[Dante] Whoa!

Okay, team. We might not know
what's causing all these problems,

247
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,379
but it's up to us to keep everyone safe.

248
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:14,799
We should split up to cover more ground.

00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,560
Someone must've messed
with our Compass Eyes.

00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:53,522
They control all the magic that opens
and closes the walls to the exhibits.

I-I took them. I thought maybe
they could help me find my Compass Eye?

293
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,749
But then I got distracted
and lost track of them.

This is my fault.

we need to get everyone out
of their exhibits and into the rotunda.

If the back walls close for good
while someone is on the other side,

[gasping] Oh no! Pedro!

-[wind howling]
-[crackling]

346
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:35,684
Ridley!

347
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:36,894
Over here!

348
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,896
[Ida yelling] Charge!

349
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:42,107
-Hey, Ida! Pedro needs help!
-No time, my lady.

350
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,652
Leading the butterflies
once more unto the breach!

351
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,321
Mr. Lemurson, can you help Pedro?

352
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,865
I've gotta get my kids to safety!
Sorry, Ridley.

353
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,492
Please? Someone!

354
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,452
Pedro needs to be rescued.

355
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,371
[Pedro] Help!

356
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,498
I-I don't know if I can do it.

357
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,709
[sighing] But of course I'll try.

358
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,544
Hold on, Pedro, I'm coming.

359
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:06,882
It's getting worse.
I'm gonna have to time my jump just right.

360
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,885
Whoa! Dudley, look out!

361
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,720
-[Dudley yelping]
-[grunting] Whoa!

362
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,180
-[crackling]
-[Ridley sighing]

363
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:14,932
Ridley, what are you doing?

364
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,685
If you go in there,
the back could close for good,

365
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,728
and you'd be trapped on the other side.

366
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,522
-Forever.
-I know.

367
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:24,900
But I can't just leave Pedro in there
all by himself.

368
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,027
You guys don't need me here.

369
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:30,781
You have two protectors,
my mother and my grandmother.

370
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:33,409
-They're the best.
-But so are you, Ridley.

371
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,370
Thanks, but I'm not a protector,
it turns out.

372
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,288
I don't have what it takes.

373
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,206
Huh?

374
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:43,669
If I don't make it back,
tell everyone I love them.

375
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,045
And I love you too.

376
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:48,716
I know you usually think of me
as the stoic type, but, uh…

377
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,468
[dramatically] …please, come back, Ridley!

378
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,096
I'd miss you too much!

379
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:55,931
I'll miss you too,

380
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,933
but I have to go now.

381
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:01,353
Come on, open. Open.

382
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,064
[whimpering] Can't watch. Oh!

383
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,066
-[yelling] Open!
-[zapping]

384
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,068
-[Ridley grunting]
-[wind blowing]

385
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,905
Ridley, over here!

386
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,533
Hold on, Pedro. I'm coming!

387
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:17,828
[Pedro calling] Ridley!

388
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,831
[grunting]

389
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:23,500
[gasping] Ridley, you came!

390
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:24,543
I did.

391
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:27,379
And seriously,
we gotta stop meeting like this.

392
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:28,714
I was scared.

393
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,507
It was noisy in the museum,

394
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,468
so I came here to hide.

395
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,762
I understand wanting to hide.

396
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:37,556
Then this big branch fell on me.

397
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,099
But now you're here.

398
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:42,811
I know you can just lasso it up
and get it off of me.

399
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,271
I don't have my rope.

400
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,023
[gasping] Or any of my gear.

401
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,900
[sighing] I didn't deserve it.

402
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:50,486
Ridley, you're gonna save me, right?

403
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,279
You better believe I am!

404
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,031
[crackling]

405
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:57,201
But I gotta do it soon
or we're gonna get stuck out here.

406
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,452
[Ridley grunting]

407
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:02,873

[grunting, groaning]

409
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,960
[sadly] You… you can't do it?

410
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,296
I haven't even begun to try.

411
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:10,506
[grunting]

412
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,133
Not heavy enough.

413
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,301
[gasping] I know!

414
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,095

417
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:24,019
[grunting] Come on, come on!

418
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,813
Here we go! [grunting]

419
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,773
I'm free, I'm free!

420
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,900
Thank you, Ridley Jones!

421
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:31,110
-[crackling]
-Oh no!

422
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:34,196
We're gonna get stuck in here.
I have to get you out!

423
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,990
[wind howling]

424
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:40,452
What do you mean, she went in there?
Why didn't you stop her?

425
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,497
I'm not as big and tough as you are, Fred.

426
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,250
Well, that's true. But still, this is bad.

427
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,043
The portal's already closed!

428
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,628
-[crackling]
-[Dudley] Oh!

429
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,213
Wait! There she is!

430
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:54,091
-Go with the flow, dude!
-Bring it in for landin'!

431
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,261
The flashing's getting worse.

432
00:18:57,344 --> 00:19:00,347
I don't think we have much time
before it closes for good.

[grunting, sighing]

434
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:05,644
Pedro, tell my mama I love her.

435
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,020
Everyone else too.

436
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,314
But, Ridley, why don't you tell them…

437
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,066
[yelling] …yourself?

438
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,609
Whee!

00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,111
-Whoa!
-[all yelling]

440
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,280
Oh, hey, Pedro.

441
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,407
[gasping] No, no, Ridley!

00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,658
[Mama] No!

443
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:20,617

Mom!

447
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,665
I know, baby.

448
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,877
There must be some magic
we don't know about yet.

449
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,961
We'll find it.

450
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:32,796
Someday.

451
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,424
Ridley told me to tell you

452
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:38,802
she loves you and she'll miss you.

453
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,013
-All of you.
-[Mama gasping]

454

[sadly] Mama.

Dante, Dudley, Ismat, Peaches,

457
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:50,480
I'll miss you all.

458
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,858
But I did what I had to do.

[mystical twinkling]

460
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:58,572
A map?

00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,157
[gasping] What is that?

Is it? [gasping]

It is!

I am a protector!

Just like my mama
and my grandma before me.

Oh, Ridley!

00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,548
The Jones women, together again!

484
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:02,219
The Jones women,
museum protectors, together again.

485
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:05,514
-Your Compass Eye! You found it!
-And it found you.

-Ridley!
-I can't believe it!

00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,978
After I got Pedro back safely,

489
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:15,023
a map appeared in my passport.
It showed me where to find my Compass Eye.

490
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,818
That was the ultimate act of selflessness.

491
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:20,279
The sign of a true protector.

492
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,739
Now, let's see
if we can reverse this curse.

Oh my! It's almost morning!

497
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,798
Mr. Peabody will be here any minute.

498
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:42,592
-And everyone's scattered.
-I got this.

499
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:45,095
But I'm gonna need--

500
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,221
Yeah, you are.

Back where it belongs.

503
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:53,437
Now, you're just missing one thing.

504
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,732
-Ridley, this is yours.
-It is.

505

Thank you, guys, for keeping these safe.

Everyone, listen.

-[twinkling]
-That glow!

512
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:19,504
I think I know where the other two are.

513
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:22,507
Oh! What are you Joneses doing here?

514
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:23,508
We live here!

515
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:27,554
We're missing two artifacts. You haven't
seen them, have you, Mr. Peabody?

516
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:28,722
[Peabody groaning]

517
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:31,099
Fine! These are worthless anyway.

518
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,935
Couldn't even get the darn things open
to see what's inside.

519

is in the eye of the beholder.
