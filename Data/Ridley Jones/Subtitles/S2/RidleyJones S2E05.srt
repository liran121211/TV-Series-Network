with their super bisonic strength.

174
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,488
Oh, you bet your horns I can.

175
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:12,116
And we'll go even faster
if everyone helps me push Lou along.

176
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,159
[Lou grunting]

177
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:16,954
I don't know. Getting across this bridge
will be tricky and dangerous.

178
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,706
I'll do the pushing myself.

179
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,459
[Ridley grunting]

180
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,836
[bridge creaking]

181
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,922
I'm doing it. [grunting]

182
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,299
[bridge creaking]

183
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:31,219
Rope and stone don't mix.
We move too slow.

184
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:35,765
Ridley, we could lend you a hand.
Or a wing, a hoof, a claw.

185
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:36,682
Anything.

186
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,101
[Dante] Yeah, you need speed. Remember?

187
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,479
It's fine. Just follow my lead.

188
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:42,730
[creaking, snapping]

189
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,899
-They're breaking!
-Faster, dudes!

190
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:47,068
I got this. I got this.

191
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,986
-[creaking]
-Yeah, I don't got this!

192
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,364
-[Ridley] Whoa!
-[all yelling]

193
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,615
[crashing, grunting]

194
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,492
-[sighing]
-Everyone okay?

195
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:55,910
[groaning] Yes.

196
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:56,869
-Uh-huh.
-Yep.

197
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,829
-Think so.
-I am.

198
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:02,542
Except for the fact
that there's no way out of here.

199
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,793
[Dante grunting]

200
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,836
This pit, metaphor.

201
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,922
And it's, like, also getting dark.

202
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:11,259
Sun has set on painting sunset.

203
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,885
What do we do now, Ridley?

204
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,430
Something I've never had to do before.

205
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:17,932
-[sighing]
-[beeping]

206
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,643
Grandma, I need help.

207
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,604
[biplane roaring]

208
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:27,024
[whimsical music playing]

209
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,401
Tubular!

210
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:33,781
Ooh, thanks for coming to save us,
Dr. Jones. That pit was the pits!

211
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:37,785
Of course! Always happy
to help you Eyes out of a jam.

212
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,747
[Lou] It's okay, Ridley.

213
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:45,960
We didn't make it,
but Rome not built in day.

214
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,254
I can't believe I…

215
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,047
I failed.

216
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,384
[sad music playing]

217
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,267
-What are you doing, Ridley?
-[Ridley sighing]

218
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:05,062
Grandma, I couldn't help Lou
or my pals on our trip.

219
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:08,441
I tried so hard to live up to
the Jones family name

220
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,192
and be a good protector, but…

221
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:15,364
I failed. I don't think I deserve to
have my portrait up there next to yours.

222
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,867
Being a protector doesn't mean
you don't make mistakes

223
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,493
or have nothing left to learn.

224
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:23,331
That's the thing about adventuring.
It never stops being an adventure.

225
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:26,542
And adventures are easier
with the help of your friends.

226
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:30,963
[gasping] I thought to keep everyone safe,
I had to do everything myself.

227
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,716
A protector is only as strong as her team.

228
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:37,595
And I have the best team!
I need to make things right with them.

229
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,765
-[Grandma chuckling]
-Thanks, Grandma.

230
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:46,437
So, I'm really sorry for not listening
to you on our hike yesterday.

231
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,106
I get it now. I need your strength,

232
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,193
your leadership, your caution, your moves,

233
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:53,653
and your right stuff.

234
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,655
-Oh!
-[Ismat] Of course.

235
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,573
[Fred] Oh, we got you!

236
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,868
Thanks. Now, what do you say
we head out on a new--

237
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:04,997
Well, do-over adventure? I'll need
all of your help to get us up to the top.

238
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,750
Eyes on three. One, two…

239
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,085
[together] Eyes!

240
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,047
Show us the best way
up to the point, Peaches.

241
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,675
Copy that! Follow my lead!

242
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,638
I think it's a mummy's time to shine!

243
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,431
Oh yeah! On it!

244
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:25,726
[Lou grunting]

245
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,061
[Fred] Nice!

246
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:28,979
[Peaches grunting]

247
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,815
The bridge is back, y'all!

248
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:35,027
-[Fred] Time for this rock to roll.
-[Dante] We've got a need for speed!

249
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,863
-[all grunting]
-[bridge creaking]

250
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,699
[Lou chuckling] Whee!

251
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,117
[cheering, chuckling]

252
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,453
Pipin' hot monkey bread! Y'all made it!

253
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,914
Now take a gander at this view.

254
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,749
-[whistling]
-[all murmuring]

255
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:52,461
-[Ridley] It's beautiful.
-Better than dream.

256
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:56,090
Welcome to Serengeti Point, Lou.
Ready to paint?

257
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:58,968
With all my heart.

258
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,555
-[Fred] It's perfect.
-[Dudley chuckling]

259
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:06,267
Actually, how do you feel about
painting me a new portrait?

260
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:10,020
[clearing throat] Let's see.

261
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,273
[triumphant music playing]

262
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:13,441
[group] That's us!

263
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:17,695
Lou, you captured exactly
what being a protector means to me.

264
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:21,949
Adventuring is always an adventure,
but with friends by your side,

265
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:24,118
you can face anything.

266
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,833
-[whimsical music]
-[Ridley] Moles Shall Overcome.

267
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:34,879
Our next contestant
on Celebrity Tag-a-Mole

268
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,589
is Ridley Jones!

269
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,883
Taggers are locked and loaded!

270
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:42,553
Five, four, three, two…

271
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:43,929
[together] Tag!

272
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:48,517
[moles giggling]

273
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,518
Whew!

274
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,853
[moles giggling]

275
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,730
-Yippee!
-Yay, Ridley!

276
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:53,773
[grunting]

277
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,983
-No!
-[Dante] Cool!

278
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,818
-Gotcha!
-[mole giggling]

279
00:12:58,527 --> 00:12:59,528
[Ridley laughing]

280
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,613
Woo-hoo!

281
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:01,822
[Ridley giggling]

282
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:06,035
[snorting] Bisonic job, Ridley!
Who's our next Tag-a Mole tagger?

283
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,036
-[grunting]
-Huh?

284
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,662
[Dudley grunting]

285
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:09,747
Dudley?

286
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:13,876
Don't look so surprised.
I've played tag with the best of 'em!

287
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:17,004
Five, four, three, two…

288
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,088
[together] Tag!

289
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,465
[yelling]

290
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:20,883
Oh! [grunting]

291
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,677
-[moles giggling]
-[Dudley groaning] Whoa!

292
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,304
Come on, D-Bird.

293
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,765
-I'm gonna get you! Oh!
-[Peaches] Oh boy.

294
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,434
-[moles giggling]
-Oh, come on!

295
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,269
-Stay still!
-[moles giggling]

296
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,437
[Dudley groaning]

297
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,231
-[moles giggling]
-[Dudley sighing]

298
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,441
[muffled] Well,
this isn't my finest moment.

299
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,485
Also not your worst moment.

300
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,654
Uh, do we need to go rescue Dudley?

301
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:46,158
Your turn. I pulled him out
of the giant nose in the bodies exhibit.

302
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,868
[gasping, sighing]

303
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,161
Who am I kidding?

304
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,955
I'm never gonna tag a mole.

305
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:54,667
Don't worry, Mr. Dudley.
I've got ya, or my name isn't Maggie.

306
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,544
Nice to meet you,

307
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,879
but careful with the wings when you--

308
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,047
[Dudley groaning]

309
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,842
Agh! Oof! [yelling]

310
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,510
[Dudley yelling, groaning]

311
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:07,555
Meet my Tag-a-Mole friend Maggie.

312
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,932
-Hi, hi, hi, hi!
-Isn't she cute?

313
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:13,936
Mama, Dudley got
his very first Tag-a-Mole tag.

314
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:18,399
Ooh, Tag-a-Mole!
Back in the day, I was the reigning champ.

315
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:21,318
-Count me down, Peaches.
-Roger that, Captain Jones.

316
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,279
Five, four, three--

317
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,740
-[Peabody] Hurry up, I don't have all day.
-[Lonny] You got it!

318
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,243
It's Mr. Peabody! Everybody hide.

319
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,121
Dudley, hurry!

320
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,247
[Dudley gulping]

321
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:37,167
[muffled] Uh, dudes, I've got
some good news and some bad news.

322
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:40,504
[grunting] Okay, just bad news.
I'm righteously stuck!

323
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,964
-[Dante grunting]
-Shh!

324
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,424
Ah, Dr. Jones!

325
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:46,594
Hi! What a lovely surprise.

326
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:49,597
Yes, yes, I'm sure
you must be thrilled to see me.

327
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,767
Start putting up that yellow tape.
This mole habitat is hereby closed.

328
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,728
You got it, Mr. Peabody, sir!

329
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:59,648
You can't close the mole habitat.
That's where we play Tag-a-Mo--

330
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:04,862
I mean, organize the exhibit because
nothing in it is alive and never will be.

331
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,656
They're tearing it down
to make room for a new coffee shop.

332
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,827
But the museum is for kids like me,
and we don't even drink coffee.

333
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:15,080
This children's museum isn't for children.
It's for making money.

334
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,750
And a new coffee shop
will make lots of it.

335
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,544
-Lonny, are you done yet?
-Almost done!

336
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,713
[Peabody groaning]

337
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:26,508
Maybe we could think of a different place
for your coffee shop.

338
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,969
I've grown tired of you Joneses.

339
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,472
This exhibit is closed, and that's final!

340
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:36,393
If you do get in my way again,
I'd be delighted to fire you.

341
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,897
-Lonny, we're leaving.

00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,112
We did, thanks to you.

510
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:28,323
But what are we going to do
next time Mr. Pea-bottom

511
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,450
tries to shut down an exhibit?

512
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:33,537
Simple. We're gonna keep on
fighting against extinction

513
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,622
and fighting to do what's right.

514
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:38,333
You know what?
Doing what's right feels kinda good.

515
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,835
It sure does.

516
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,587
-This is so cool!

517
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,798
[child 4] Can we come back tomorrow?

00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:51,638
