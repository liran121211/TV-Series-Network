[slowly] Thank you for everything you've--

346
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,670
[normal] For everything you've done,
is what she's trying to say.

347
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,839
Hi, I'm Julietta.

348
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,176
My parents tell me
I'm the fast talker of the family.

349
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,387
Nice to meet you.
Glad you and your family are okay.

350
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,056
Yeah, me too.

351
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,934
[sighing] Still, I miss
my favorite blankie.

352
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,519
When do y'all think we can go back home?

353
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:41,315
I don't know. Lonny wasn't sure
how long fixing the pipe would take.

354
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:44,109
Oh. Okay. Well, thanks.

355
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:49,281
[pensive music playing]

356
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:55,788
[sighing softly]

357
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,623
[sighing]

358
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,588
You couldn't sleep either?

359
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:09,009
Yeah, I just don't feel like
my usual royal self.

360
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:12,930
I mean, I look fabulous,
as per usual, but--

361
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:15,641
I just kept thinking about
our sloth friends.

362
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:19,228
[sighing] Me too.
But don't they have everything they need?

363
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:23,107
Then why do I feel like we did
something wrong? Let's go check on them.

364
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:25,567
[door opening]

365
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,320
[sloths snoring]

366
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:31,532
[yawning, snoring]

367
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:35,577
This storage room is terrible. I mean,
none of us would wanna live here.

368
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,955
True, there's no room for grazing.

369
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:39,498
No view of the stars.

370
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:42,167
No cuddly plush dodos to hug.

371
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:45,963
The sloths may have
everything they need to survive,

372
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:49,049
but they don't have a home.
We can do better than this.

373
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,217
[together] Yes!

374
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:54,763
Come on out, sloths. We're gonna find you
a way better place to stay.

375
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,266
-[sloth] Yeah.
-[Julietta] Thank you, Ridley!

376
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,642
[slowly] Sorry

377
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,895
for getting so overexcited.

378
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,105
[Ridley chuckling]

379
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,525
We need to find
another spot for the sloths.

380
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:07,901
Any ideas, team?

381
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,279
Hm, what about the Egyptian wing?

382
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,822
The princess has tons of space

383
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:15,117
and it's way fancier
than some musty old storage closet.

384
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,245
Oh, well, um, I am a royally good hostess.

385
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:23,000
Julietta, how'd you like to spend
the night in an Egyptian palace?

386
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,710
[gasping] Really?

387
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,464
What's this?

388
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,716
-[Peaches gasping]
-[Dante] Whoa!

389
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,428
-[Fred gasping]
-[slowly] I got it.

390
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:36,764
[Fred grunting] Phew!

391
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,223
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

392
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:41,351
Let go of that.
I know a booby-trap when I see one.

393
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,394
[rumbling]

394
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:45,606
[panicked] Seriously, like,
let go, right now. Please?

395
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:51,528
[slowly] I'm going as fast as I can.

396
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,364
You gotta go faster.
The room is filling with sand!

397
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:58,869
This is so soft. It reminds me
of my favorite blankie back home.

398
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:02,915
Yeah, it's actually a special shawl
that I got from my dads.

399
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:07,127
I love it because it's fit for a queen,
like me. [chuckling nervously]

400
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,129
Oops. Sorry.

401
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,964
Oh, that's all right.

402
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,259
Would you mind wearing this one instead?

403
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,762
[Ismat laughing awkwardly] Ridley!

404
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:19,515
As much as I love our sloth friends,
and I do,

405
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:23,102
I was thinking,
maybe this isn't the right place for them.

406
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,729
You know where might work?

407
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,064
[gulping] Where?

408
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,108
[sloths snoring]

409
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:32,069
Banana, yum.

410
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,904
[Peaches] Uh, hey, y'all.

411
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,782
Uh, please don't do that, or touch that!

412
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:37,908
Or go there.

413
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,952
Especially, don't peel that!

414
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,703
[Ridley] How's it goin' in here?

415
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,749
Furrier than I'm used to.
And that's sayin' somethin'.

416
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:50,045
Sorry, sunshine, I don't think this
is the right place for the sloths either.

417
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,714
But you know where might be good?

418
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,634
[Fred panting]

419
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,970
Nope, not gonna work.

420
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,721
[Fred groaning]

421
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,182
[caribou yelping]

422
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:05,227
Too many sloths! I can't stampede!

423
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,687
[eagles squawking]

424
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,025
So slippery!

425
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,861
Look out below!

426
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,327
Sorry, Ridley.

427
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,246
[sighing] We tried everywhere.

428
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,874
[slowly] It's hopeless.

429
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:27,833
Ooh.

430
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:31,545
Sorry for flying off the handle like that.

431
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:34,089
-But--
-Thanks anyway, Ridley.

432
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,509
[sadly] My family and I
will just go back to storage.

433
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,220
No, this isn't right.

434
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:44,016
But there wasn't a single spot
in the museum that was sloth friendly.

435
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,560
That's because
we didn't make it sloth friendly.

436
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,312
We have to give it another shot.

437
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,899
-[whistling]
-[zebras barking]

438
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:56,445
Hey, everyone, listen up.

439
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,614
I know you all had the sloths
in your exhibits,

440
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,491
and for one reason or another,
it didn't work out.

441
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,327
-No.
-I've got a need to stampede.

442
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,786
There's so much fur.

443
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,247
-Those bananas.
-My royal artifacts.

444
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,416
Think about what the sloths
are going through.

445
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:12,920
How would you feel if you had to leave
your home and all your stuff?

446
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:16,381
And not only that,
you had to live in a dark storage room.

447
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,718
-Oh, I'd feel terrible.
-That sounds awful.

448
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:23,430
We say we tried to help the sloths,
but our hearts weren't in it.

449
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:27,851
We didn't want our lives to change,
even though theirs changed so much.

450
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,729
I guess we weren't
very good museum neighbors.

451
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:33,398
All I know is, not in my backyard.

452
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:36,693
Charlotte, that's the kind of attitude
that got us here.

453
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,655
No, I just mean not in my backyard,

454
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:43,283
'cause it's full of actual quicksand.
But I agree with Ridley.

455
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:47,996
Even a queen makes mistakes,
but she also knows when to fix them.

456
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,998
We'll help with the sloths, Ridley.

457
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,042
-Yeah!
-[cheering]

458
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:55,587
Then let's go stop those sloths
before they go back into storage.

Oh.

00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,468
Guess they didn't get very far.

462
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,095
[Ismat] Hey, Julietta.

463
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,055
I'm sorry about before.

464
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:07,975
You and your family
had to give up so much,

465
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,978
so I can give up something too.

466
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,020
