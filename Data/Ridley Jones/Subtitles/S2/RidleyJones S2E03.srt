That's why your stamp must've disappeared.

The merch booth? Huh.
There's no way around this thing.

343
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,212
You'll have to go
to the exhibit another way.

344
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:48,173
-But we don't know another way.
-We'll get lost.

345
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:51,719
-Sounds like you need a tour guide.
-Or a leader.

346
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,762
And I know just the one. Fred.

347
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,556
[snorting] Oh, I don't know.

348
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:59,601
I'm not sure I've got the hide
or the horns to lead this herd.

349
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:00,686
Or any herd.

350
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:03,689
You won't have to do it alone.
We'll help you, Fred.

351
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:07,192
[uneasy] Uh, okay. I'll do it.

352
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:10,738
Peaches, can you go to the security room
and get the status of the flowers?

353
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,823
We have to get there
before they all bloom.

354
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:16,076
Mission accepted!
I'll get my peepers on the petals.

355
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,786
[Fred clears throat] Um…

356
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,121
Hi, everyone.

357
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,541
So, I've never been
a butterfly herd leader before.

358
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:25,210
-That's okay.
-We've never had a leader before.

359
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:28,130
So this'll be something new for everyone.

360
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:31,425
All you have to do
is follow me to the exhibit.

361
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,552
-Think you can do that?
-I hope so.

362
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:35,095
We'll try!

363
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,931
Pipin' hot monkey bread, Ridley.

364
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,684
The first flower's already startin'
to bloom, which means

365
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:43,312
Peabody'll be openin' the museum
any minute.

366
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,189
Thanks, Peaches. Ready, Fred?

367
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,356
I guess so.

368
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,610
All right, little flappers,
let's moo-ve out.

369
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:52,154
-[giggling] Little flappers!
-That means us.

[butterflies giggling]

371
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:56,492
Now we'll just take this hallway
over here. Got that?

372
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,911
Uh, nope, they don't got that.

373
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,579
[giggling] The colors!

374
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:03,040
Hey, uh, we don't have time for this.

375

-[giggling]
-I'm doing art!

376
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,586
We need to get these butterflies moo-vin'.

377
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,296
-What if--
-I know how!

378
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,799
These butterflies have an eye for color.

379
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,426
I love when fashion is the answer!

380
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:19,556
Cool! Wings!

381
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,977
I already have a pair,
but these are much more glittery!

382
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,522
The butterflies see butterfly wings,

383
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:30,400
maybe it'll be easier for them
to follow me.

384
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:33,987
I mean, you. Everyone, strut after me.

385
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,948
[butterflies] Oh, pretty!

386
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,075
I want wings too!

387
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:39,701
You already have wings.

388
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,079
-Oh!
-So beautiful!

389
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:45,666
We got them to stop painting,
but they're still distracted.

390
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:48,502
[groaning] Some leader I am.

391
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:52,339
Don't give up. We'll find a way
to get the butterflies back in the air.

392
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:55,759
[Dudley] Let me speak to them,
winged creature to winged creature.

393
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,679
Hey, butterflies!
I need you to line up for me.

394
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,514
Line up? Like, why?

395
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:03,267
So they can fly in formation.

396
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:06,520
That's what I would do
if I could actually fly.

397
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:09,523
You go here, and you over here, and--

398
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:12,401
Hey, hey, hey,
wings off your brother's antenna.

399
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:13,735
And, uh, there.

400
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,320
I don't know, Dudley.

401
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:18,824
The little flappers have a hard enough
time going in the same direction.

402
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:23,912
Flying in formation is kind of…
advanced, don't you think?

403
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:28,000
Nah. This couldn't be simpler.
Okay, butterflies, let's get some lift.

404
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,543
Higher. Higher.

405
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:33,172
Go thataway, butterflies.
No, the other thataway.

406
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,381
This thataway!

407
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:37,092
-Huh? Which way?
-Oh, I'm so confused!

408
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:41,430
Okay, I can see how
this might be confusing.

409
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,433
Hello there, little butterflies.

410
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,059
-Hi!
-[happy squealing]

411
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,728
Oh, your wings!

412
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:50,689
[giggling] They're tickling me!

413
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:54,026
Oh, I don't think that's such a good idea.

414
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,778

[butterflies squealing]

416
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,532
So, they finally leave the rotunda

417
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,785
and end up
in the tundra exhibit? [groaning]

418
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,205
We gotta get them out of there
before Mr. Peabody…

419
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,707
-[Peabody] Joneses?
-…notices that they're gone.

420
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,542
Quick, everyone, freeze.

421
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:15,631
I've just been to the pollination exhibit.
There isn't a single butterfly in there!

422
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,382
I'm workin' on it, Mr. P.

423
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:20,469
Well, work on it a little faster.

424
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,347
There are flowers blooming,
and if the guests miss it,

425
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,266
there'll only be you
and your mother to blame.

426
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,269
Honestly, how hard can it be
to move a few butterflies?

427
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,480
Harder than you'd think, actually.

428
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:35,817
Okay, since we're in a royal time crunch,
I'll lead the butterfly rescue.

429
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:39,529
I have an idea too,
but we're gonna need a lot of skateboards.

430
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,490
The tundra's not a safe place,

431
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,618
especially for a bunch
of helpless butterflies.

432
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:48,205
But to save them, we need a good leader.
Know any?

433
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:51,667
-I used to think that I was one.
-You still are.

434
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,504
Stop letting everyone tell you how
to be a leader and just be Fred.

435
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,507
So, be small and adorable?

436
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,134
And brave and smart and fierce.
