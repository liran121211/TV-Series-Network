1
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:19,190
CAPTAIN MARLEAU

2
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,910
THALASSO FOG

3
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:23,550
Come on, come on!

4
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,390
Go on, climb up there! Go on!

5
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,270
Who gave me
this band of weaklings?

6
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,990
Good to see you, Captain.

7
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,150
Don't get excited,
just passing through.

8
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,390
Go on! Go on! And boom,
you're dead, you climbed too high!

9
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,430
Not how to win!

10
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,430
Have you warmed up?

11
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,790
-Yes, of course.
-Yes.

12
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,350
One, two, three!

13
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:55,550
He is cute.

14
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,550
-Captain.
-Comrade.

15
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,270
-Hello.
-Hello.

16
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,710
Your dancers are pretty.

17
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:02,830
Attack me.

18
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,070
Mime weapon attack

19
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:07,150
and come at me like
you want to stab me with a knife.

20
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,150
Simple. All in the dodge. Up.

21
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,390
Get up. Try again.

22
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,670
Go on. Attack me!

23
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,710
-You okay?
-Yes, thank you.

24
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,830
Can I take his place?

25
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:37,150
Captain Marleau...
We will do the exercise backwards.

26
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,310
It's me attacking you
and you try to dodge me.

27
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:41,830
Ready?

28
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:42,990
Careful. Arthritis.

29
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:51,150
My favorite blow: the balls.
I love Patrick Dewaere.

30
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,990
It was good, but it was--

31
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,710
They're too careful, right?

32
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,870
They're not letting go, are they?

33
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,270
Stop. You're too far away
from one another.

34
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,270
You should feel the right distance.

35
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,030
Be aware of the other's body.
If not, it won't work, okay?

36
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,670
You understand that?
Okay, we'll start again.

37
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,670
Restart, from the start of the lifts,

38
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,870
let's go!
Five, six, seven, eight, and...

39
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:54,310
Wait, wait! Don't forget,
they're crazy in love.

40
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,710
So every time you can,
make eye contact.

41
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:57,830
Right in the eyes.

42
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,030
We are telling a love story,
everyone.

43
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,270
Garance is right.

44
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,110
Forget yourselves!

45
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,710
A good dancer is a dancer
whose technique disappears...

46
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,150
And Vladimir says so! Okay?

47
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,470
Pardon me.

48
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,830
It's you? Yes, no, tonight of course.

49
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,550
Garance? Are you okay?

50
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,750
Yes, in the garden. Agreed?

51
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:18,750
Garance, you okay?

52
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,990
Yes. Shall we go over it again?

53
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,470
Yes, let's go.
Kids, restart! Let's go!

54
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:27,590
Eye contact, let's go.

55
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,750
Five, six, seven, eight, and...

56
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,830
-How are you?
-Very good, Sir.

57
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,310
-Here.
-Thank you.

58
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,390
-Evening, Ida.
-Hello, Mr. Thibaut.

59
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,590
Is Luc in his office?

60
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,830
Exactly. Want me
to tell him you're here?

61
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,190
Yes, please.
Has my wife arrived yet?

62
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,630
She's at the restaurant.

63
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:49,830
Good. Are you more beautiful
each time I see you, or am I wrong?

64
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,550
Thank you very much, Sir.

65
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,990
Good evening.

66
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,830
At least pretend
to be happy to see me?

67
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,110
Evening, Mr. Thibaut.

68
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,470
Evening, Michael. My usual.

69
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:09,430
Good, Sir.

70
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:12,430
Thought I'd give you a surprise
by coming to tell you

71
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,470
that I just bought
all these old walls.

72
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,750
What do you say?
It's a good surprise, right?

73
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,350
Truly, you are pathetic!

74
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,630
You still need the illusion
I'm under your thumb?

75
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,030
That's not nice.

76
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,470
I really have no desire
to be, believe me!

77
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,630
You have your own little secrets?

78
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,710
I heard you had come back to...

79
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,190
your artistic vocation.

80
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,190
Our divorce gives you wings, right?

81
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,310
I regret not doing it sooner.

82
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,150
You're cute.

83
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,590
-How do you do it?
-What?

84
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,350
How did you change so much?

85
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,750
Please...

86
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,750
When I met you, you were
funny, brilliant, intelligent.

87
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,430
I gave up everything for you.

88
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:52,710
What happened, Paul?

89
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,910
What did you do to become this guy?

90
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,990
This is not the time or the place...

91
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,470
Until Clément left,
I'd forgiven everything.

92
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,030
All of it!
Your absence, your escapades!

93
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,270
Your mistresses!

94
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:06,070
Your mistresses too! All of it!
I was indifferent to it all!

95
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,350
Then Clément left
and I opened my eyes.

96
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,270
You are wrong.

97
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,470
But you are wrong!
How could you?

98
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:15,790
How could you sleep with...
your son's girlfriend?

99
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,630
What are you talking about?

100
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,590
And me, like an idiot...I...I...

101
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,030
Come on! You are crazy!

102
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:25,350
But I did not see anything, but...
Shut up!

103
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,030
Once our divorce is signed,

104
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,430
I never want to hear from you again.
Never!

105
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,750
Good evening. Pardon me.

106
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,870
So, what happened?

107
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,750
I think she cannot stand
the idea of our separation.

108
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,870
If I can do anything,
you know you can count on me.

109
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,910
Thank you, Luc, it is okay.

110
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:14,350
Why not stay and eat with us?
Miléna would be glad to see you.

111
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,790
I do not know, I...

112
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:19,710
Go on! Stay. This is sort of
your place now, right?

113
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:30,510
Good evening, Garance!
How are you?

114
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,470
At last, I am happy to see you.

115
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,630
-Yes?
-I want you to prepare my notice.

116
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:38,470
I will go at the end of the week.
I want to pay for it.

117
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,910
But of course. Will you tell me?

118
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,710
Thank you for your information...

119
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:43,950
Pardon me?

120
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,550
Paul's lucky to buy the hotel,

121
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,550
but believe me...

122
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:51,350
knowing him, you will very quickly
be part of the staff.

123
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,350
You see, Luc, I am a romantic!

124
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,150
I never viewed matters
in a Cartesian way, you see?

125
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:15,630
I am sure that
you're just like me, by the by.

126
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,470
What's that?

127
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:20,430
It is the adventure that seduces us.
Would you not agree?

128
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,430
You know how attached
I am to this place.

129
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,830
Without your loan,
I would never have got by...

130
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,270
Thank you, Jérémy.
I will take care of it.

131
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:35,790
Your new stockholder by your side,
you are still in charge.

132
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,950
And then from time to time,
the two of us

133
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:40,390
will look at the numbers.

134
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:44,590
Clearly, as soon as I can start
to buy parts back--

135
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,150
But no! Buying back?

136
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:49,950
No! I am very happy
with my investment.

137
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,870
-But it is--
-No, but wait, Luc, honestly!

138
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:53,950
No, forget it.

139
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,390
We are here to drink
a fine bottle of wine.

140
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,870
Believe me, I need it.

141
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,870
By the way,
where is your charming wife?

142
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:01,670
She will be here soon.

143
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,510
What was I telling you?

144
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:08,070
You say her name and she appears
as if by magic.

145
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,630
In business as in love,
you are a lucky man!

146
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,390
Paul, I am pleased to see you!

147
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,510
I return the compliment.

148
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,670
I would say you are the most
beautiful apparition of my day.

149
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,110
You are exaggerating.

150
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,230
Do you want a glass of wine?

151
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,710
With pleasure!

152
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:29,710
Paul, please!
Not here, not tonight!

153
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,230
Forget about it, Luc!

154
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,910
I will give you all of the shares
in the hotel! Okay?

155
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,950
The investment is for you!
It is yours!

156
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,190
I don't want to. Get it?

157
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,950
No, listen! You know,
as soon as I saw you,

158
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:43,270
I realized I could
no longer do without you.

159
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:46,070
Please! I was swept along
in this story.

160
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,630
But no more, Paul!
I love Luc, understand?

161
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,110
Leave me alone!

162
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,070
HOTEL LES BAINS

163
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:38,110
Justine, check the bath towels.

164
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:38,910
Yes, Madam.

165
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:42,110
Do not forget to smile at clients
when you enter rest areas.

166
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,630
Marie, when you finish your antics,

167
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,150
come to the treatment rooms.

168
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,390
Send a cleaner to balneotherapy.

169
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,710
I will take care of it.

170
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,750
Check the Kaolin mud bath room too.

171
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:03,950
Georges fixed it,

172
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,750
but I'm sure he's left it a mess.

173
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,150
I will go there now.

174
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,670
Stay here, don't move.
I'll tell Mr. Luc.

175
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,550
Chabu!

176
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:03,670
Léon, Zitrone! Heel, dogs!

177
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,510
Go on, heel! That is good!

178
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,310
That is good!

179
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,430
So, Brière!
What is going on?

180
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,510
You are pale!
Are you scared of dogs?

181
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,430
Yes, when I was little
I was bitten on my lip.

182
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,070
Yes, I see it. What is up?

183
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,390
Death, Hotel Les Bains.

184
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,670
What emergency?

185
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,270
A drowning in a mud bath.

186
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,830
Sat up in a bath?
That is not pratical!

187
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:28,550
It is not that I am getting bored,
but duty is calling out to me.

188
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,950
And "duty is power",
as an old friend of mine used to say.

189
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:32,870
A philosopher?

190
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,830
No, a bar regular, a real one!

191
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,110
Lucky, at least you knew
where to find him.

192
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:40,710
Hold on! I have nothing,
so grumpy soup tonight.

193
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,030
Come on, let's go.

194
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,830
My darlings.

195
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,990
And Léon and Zitrone.
They are both here!

196
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:59,630
Great youth hostel.

197
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,550
One night is at least minimum wage!

198
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,510
At least.

199
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,390
Sir. Comrades.

200
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:11,150
But as I say,
it is time for my mud bath!

201
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,670
You will calm down, Sir.

202
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:20,550
The Balnéo room
is currently not available.

203
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,750
I cannot say more.

204
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,710
Surely I can have an explanation!

205
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,870
Listen! It is not possible!

206
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,270
I was here this morning.

207
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,830
I intend to take advantage!

208
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:32,150
Can we know why the police
are invading this hotel?

209
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,870
I have no more details for you.

210
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:36,230
Management will contact you
in good time.

211
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,230
But for now, I ask you to be patient.

212
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,230
Thank you.

213
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:42,390
I will ask you
to go back to your rooms

214
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:46,750
for the morning, and go to see
the national gendarmerie.

215
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:47,550
See! Thanks!

216
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,950
And why is that, Madam?
Is it an emergency?

217
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,990
Absolutely! You see!

218
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,390
If you do not agree,

219
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:56,150
there are protests each Friday,
Republic Square.

220
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,670
It is charming! Voila!

221
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,950
If you'd like to return
to your Imperial and Royal Suites,

222
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,870
there is a little red carpet
that awaits you.

223
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,710
You have all the channels.

224
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,750
There is a good film tonight at 8.30.

225
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,230
I recommend it. Goodbye!

226
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,990
Captain, it is down here.

227
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:19,830
-Hello.
-Hello.

228
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,270
Captain Marleau.

229
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,030
Luc Férey, I am the hotel manager.

230
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,270
Congratulations.

231
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,470
Miléna, my wife.

232
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,990
Congratulations again.

233
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,470
Did you know the victim?

234
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,870
Yes, Paul Thibaut, a friend.
He dined here last night.

235
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,030
Does he live here?

236
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:36,830
No, he has a property
about six miles away from here.

237
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:39,190
He was a business man.
He traveled a lot.

238
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,190
But his wife
has been here for a while.

239
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,670
Is she being treated here?

240
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:45,430
No, they are divorcing
and he came to see her.

241
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,190
Have you told her?

242
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:50,310
No. She left early this morning.

243
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,990
She's not answering her phone.

244
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:55,030
I still can't believe it.
It's so awful.

245
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,470
Really awful.

246
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:59,710
Comrades! It's hot in here!

247
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:00,830
Hi!

248
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:02,590
Thank you!

249
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,470
So?

250
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,550
No fingerprints.

251
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,310
Oh no?

252
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:10,150
No exploitable trace.
The room's been fully cleaned.

253
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,390
Not even a mud stain on the tiles.

254
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:15,270
Like a big floating raspberry
meringue island.

255
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:17,390
Let's see his face.

256
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,590
Come on, roll over!

257
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,310
He's floating.

258
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,470
It's Kaolin.

259
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,910
-Of what?
-Of Kaolin.

260
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,550
You know stuff about this!

261
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,310
Like floating in the Dead Sea.

262
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,390
And here, dead floating in the sea.

263
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,030
Were the doors open like this?

264
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,870
Yes, the two staff who found him
didn't touch a thing.

265
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,430
Ah, yes?

266
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:49,190
In my opinion, he drowned.

267
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,310
Because with the cut on his head...

268
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,430
Even so, a suit for a mud bath,

269
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:55,270
you'd have to be stupid.

270
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:56,870
What's up, Brière?

271
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:58,870
-I am okay.
-You're all pale.

272
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,270
It is the...

273
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:03,030
Take him out of there,
then send him to forensics.

274
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,990
Hold this, seal the evidence?
I will do a tour of the property.

275
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,310
Can I let you take care of the body?

276
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,710
It is beautiful!
Feels just like Le Touquet.

277
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:43,150
I saw that there were
many video cameras.

278
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,630
A ploy for your vigilant clients.

279
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,470
They are CCTV cameras?

280
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,990
Creating the Thalasso,

281
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,030
we equipped the whole establishment.

282
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:52,150
That's great!

283
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:55,030
We can observe
your clients' lives in detail.

284
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,190
And tell me, the video files,

285
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,030
do you save them every day?

286
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,350
Sadly, no. They don't record.

287
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,190
They are only played in real time.

288
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,550
That's totally stupid!

289
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,750
That does nothing!
If you miss it live, you're done.

290
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,070
That's it.

291
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:12,430
So, who is it
that has access to the images?

292
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:15,270
The guy in front of the computer
in my office

293
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:17,150
and the night watchman.

294
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:20,030
And when does he start his shift?

295
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,590
-10 p.m.
-10 p.m.

296
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,430
What is that blockhouse for?

297
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,990
For Fukushima clients?
In case of a nuclear attack?

298
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:30,030
It is a mechanical room

299
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,470
where we treat the Thalasso water.

300
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,310
It is locked.

301
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,790
I don't care, I...

302
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,430
Where are you going? Come here!

303
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,750
He's gonna break his neck too.

304
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,790
He had a second set of keys,
it seems.

305
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:47,750
You had a spare?

306
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,030
Are you hurt?

307
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:53,310
Let me see. Show me that.

308
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,190
Do you have a first aid kit?

309
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:57,870
Here, is that all right?

310
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:01,470
It's better than looking like
the one-eyed man of Montretout.

311
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,470
Do you not want to tell me your name?

312
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:04,430
Marin.

313
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,470
Marin! Marin's a funny name!

314
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,550
Smells like the oceans, algae,

315
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:11,230
plastic bags in whales' stomachs.

316
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,830
How did you get here?

317
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:16,190
There is a sleeping bag
and some stuff inside.

318
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,870
Because you sleep here?

319
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,150
A homeless person?

320
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,070
Have you been here for long?

321
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,630
Have you run away, is that it?

322
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,430
You can say.
I won't tell your parents.

323
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:29,510
I was kicked out of all
the Nord-Pas-de-Calais foster homes.

324
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:33,630
Did you lose your tongue
at the same time as your boat?

325
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:36,190
Captain, come see.
I think we've got something.

326
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,190
Yes, I'm coming.

327
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,510
Don't move.

328
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:43,230
He set up at the back
just behind this tank.

329
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:46,310
What misery!
We're talking about a palace...

330
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:49,910
See what I found
in a pocket of this bag.

331
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:52,190
What? Paul Thibaut.

332
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,950
It seems our Marin
is drinking sea water.

333
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,750
Bring him here. Don't worry.

334
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,910
It's where
the victim's wife's dance class is.

335
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,030
That's good.

336
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:26,950
Want me to go down
as you continue the interrogations?

337
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,470
No, I will do it.

338
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:31,470
C'est pas tellement marrant,
I will go and see her.

339
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,630
Excuse me.

340
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:36,310
We wanted to let you know
just how grateful we are

341
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:39,910
that you have resolved this tragedy
so quickly.

342
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,630
Paul was above all a friend,
a remarkable man.

343
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:44,470
Yes, we say that at funerals,

344
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:47,190
and always finish with,
'He was nice, but..."

345
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:50,190
But Captain, we are deeply affected.

346
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,470
Oh, I would not dare.

347
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:54,670
In any case,
your aquatic park is closed.

348
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:57,710
Until further notice,
as the inquiry isn't complete.

349
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:58,750
Goodbye.

350
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:51,190
Two, three, four,

351
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,190
five, six, seven...

352
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,070
So, wait!

353
00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:01,070
In ballet, the choreographer
and the dancers are 50/50.

354
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:04,390
A talented choreographer with
a performer who doesn't understand

355
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:07,470
cannot do anything,
and reciprocally.

356
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,590
Choreography takes two,
it's like love.

357
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:10,630
Let's restart.

358
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:14,630
Five, six, seven, eight, and...

359
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:17,390
-Excuse me! Garance Thibaut?
-Yes?

360
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:20,190
Marleau, national gendarmerie.
Can we talk in private?

361
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:25,470
Not too close together, yes.
That's good. Dynamic...

362
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:29,190
We found your husband's body

363
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,790
in one of the baths in your hotel.

364
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,910
He drowned himself?

365
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:38,790
Seems not. He was already dead
when he fell in the bath,

366
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,190
he was assaulted.

367
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:41,910
Very well.

368
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,070
My condolences, Mrs. Thibaut.

369
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:46,750
You were filing for divorce,
is that right?

370
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:49,790
Yes, we have been living separately
for nearly two months.

371
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:53,030
Why was it that your husband
came to see you last night?

372
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:56,550
We had some terms to agree upon
for the divorce.

373
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,910
I heard that it did not go very well.

374
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:02,630
In fact. I chose to cut it short.

375
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:03,910
I understand.

376
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,910
A slap can sometimes be a relief.

377
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,030
Hardly.

378
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:12,110
I came to say that his body is at
the morgue if you want to see it.

379
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,630
Do what you have to do.

380
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,910
You must know I'll inherit
an impressive fortune?

381
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:20,910
Yes, I heard.
Like a big lottery win, it seems.

382
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,350
In effect.

383
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:25,070
I imagine you will ask me
where I was last night.

384
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:28,190
No, it is not worth it,
there is no need.

385
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,470
Why?

386
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:31,910
Because we have already
arrested someone.

387
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,990
A young man in the hotel gardens.

388
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:36,750
He had your husband's wallet
amongst his things.

389
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:39,910
A young man? What young man?

390
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:42,750
A homeless man. Why?

391
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:45,350
And he has confessed?

392
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:48,270
No, we've not started
questioning him yet.

393
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:51,070
With a hit of the directory
it shouldn't take long.

394
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:57,910
Thank you for telling me.
I'd like to get back to my rehearsal.

395
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:01,350
This news doesn't seem
to have upset you very much?

396
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,550
My sorrow is not immense, Captain.

397
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,470
Any questions,
you know where I am.

398
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:07,790
Sorry, Madam.

399
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:26,430
Nothing serious?

400
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,190
I don't know.

401
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:31,190
No more divorce.

402
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:33,630
What? But why?

403
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:35,510
I am a widow.

404
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:36,910
So look.

405
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,910
Have a good look. Are you sure
you do not know this man?

406
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:46,190
Why did we find his wallet
among your things?

407
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,310
You are force-feeding me.

408
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:53,510
Do you realize what is happening?

409
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:56,070
You'll be charged for murder.

410
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:57,350
You got that?

411
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:59,150
It's not me. I never saw this guy.

412
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:01,510
Yes...

413
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,190
You are starting to annoy me.

414
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:09,070
I have never seen him,
but his son and his wife, yes.

415
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,070
How do you know
his son and his wife?

416
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,590
I opened the wallet.

417
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:14,910
There's a family photo.

418
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:18,790
In the wallet?

419
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,070
-This one?
-Yes.

420
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:31,230
Don't need to be smart
to get that, right?

421
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:33,230
Yes, okay.

422
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:39,230
Stop showing off.
And don't move from here.

423
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:44,230
Carpentier, watch him.

424
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:48,230
So, what does he have to say, Brière?

425
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:51,230
So his name is Marin Cibié.

426
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:54,350
Anonymous birth, 1996.
Been in a dozen foster families.

427
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:55,870
A dozen?

428
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,630
Social services say it was awful.

429
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:01,070
Mutism, rejecting authority,
violent communication...

430
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:03,350
That reminds me of someone.

431
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:05,070
He is also known to the police.

432
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,910
Shoplifting, car theft,
always violent.

433
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,630
Why was he walking in nature?

434
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:13,870
He was put in a home
until he's 18, then he disappeared.

435
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,350
Right.

436
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:19,350
Do you have news
about the night watchman?

437
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:22,790
He swears he did not see
that the kid was hiding here.

438
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,510
I also saw the hotel's clients.

439
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,350
And did you find anything?

440
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:29,510
Only retirees with nothing.
Wealthy people with nothing.

441
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:31,510
Keep looking.

442
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:34,430
If you find something
on the Thibaut family, tell me.

443
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:47,910
You should have canceled
the rehearsal.

444
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:50,750
No. Out of the question.

445
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:55,630
I am proud of you, Garance.
Proud of what you're doing!

446
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:58,070
If you knew the fear...

447
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:59,470
Fear of what?

448
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,470
Of something serious.

449
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:03,830
What?

450
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:08,790
I am scared Clément
might have seen his father.

451
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:27,350
I would say it annoys you
that it is so simple.

452
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:31,270
A corpse in the morning,
a culprit in the afternoon.

453
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:33,230
And a death sentence that night.

454
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,510
It will add to
police statistics is all.

455
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:37,350
What is bothering you?

456
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:39,110
Him, the kid.

457
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:41,870
He is a yob, but press his nose
and milk comes out.

458
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:45,270
You want to defend the orphan.

459
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:49,350
But no. I know what it is
to be discriminated against.

460
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:52,910
Then this kid, he is not that stupid.

461
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,710
He will go and kill someone,
clean the crime scene,

462
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:57,670
and go hide in a cabin nearby,

463
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:00,070
waiting for someone
to come and find him.

464
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:00,990
Whatever.

465
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:03,670
While we wait,
see this lovely side of beef!

466
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,190
It was a gift from Brière.

467
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,630
-Ah, yes?
-Yes.

468
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:10,830
His dad is a butcher. He even put
in the bones for Léon and Zitrone.

469
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,070
That was magnificent!

470
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:10,230
I really love the way
that you dance! Thank you!

471
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:23,790
Send directly to Mr.--

472
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:25,310
Hello!

473
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:26,270
Captain Marleau.

474
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,230
Here to serve, kind woman.

475
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,150
Sorry, you scared me.

476
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:33,790
That is all right, I am used to that.

477
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:35,670
Could I have a little bathrobe?

478
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,790
To test
your establishment's services?

479
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:41,510
For the treatments,
we have not reopened the Thalasso.

480
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:43,790
We are awaiting authorization.

481
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:46,510
And then everyone is still in shock.

482
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:50,390
Death at the Thalasso,
it is not great publicity.

483
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,630
Most clients
have cancelled their stays.

484
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:54,190
All emails are to cancel.

485
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,510
But that is normal.

486
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,630
There are better places right now.

487
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:58,430
Certainly.

488
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,950
I can't wait!

489
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,070
Show me what to do?

490
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:04,230
If you can handle it!
Follow me?

491
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:05,510
Thank you!

492
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:08,510
Paul was an easy contact,
disconcerting.

493
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,790
It felt like
you'd always known him.

494
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,510
And how did you find his wife?

495
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:15,670
She is... How would I say? Strange.

496
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:16,790
Strange how?

497
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:19,590
She is more reserved.
We aren't friends.

498
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:20,950
Not like Paul.

499
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,630
Yes, but still.

500
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,790
She came here when she was shut out.

501
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,950
Yes. She said she could
no longer set foot in their house,

502
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,510
or even stand that place.

503
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,950
Did he come to see her often?

504
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,950
Not really. I think he avoided it.

505
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,230
Why?

506
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:38,510
I think Paul couldn't handle
the idea of her leaving.

507
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:40,950
And as he had an excessive ego...

508
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:43,070
Little was denied to him,
I think.

509
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:44,950
Do you know their son?

510
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:47,110
Never saw him.
They didn't discuss him.

511
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,510
What do I look like?

512
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,510
A client?

513
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:52,950
Not very nice
Okay, what does this start with?

514
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:56,670
Over there. I will show you that
you have a wide range of choices.

515
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,670
Who opens the Thalasso
in the morning?

516
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:01,870
I do. I close it every evening
after the technician's check.

517
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,390
Thursday night, you closed.

518
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:04,510
Yes.

519
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,230
And the patio doors?

520
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:10,390
The door to the garden
was closed too?

521
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,390
Yes. I am sure.

522
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:14,110
Ah, yeah? Good, I will go.

523
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,790
It's hot!

524
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:21,110
Not bad, but it is hot
to a girl from the North.

525
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:22,950
It is not bad.

526
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,230
It stinks.

527
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:28,150
It smells?
Like the tide, mussels?

528
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,150
No, it's a Breton algae
essential oil.

529
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:40,510
And the technician is a plumber?

530
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:43,230
Yes, you could say that.

531
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,670
And does he have keys?

532
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:48,590
No, except those to
the machine room outside, but...

533
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,470
Is there a way I can see him today?

534
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:51,590
What I mean is,

535
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:54,390
Mr. Férey fired him
at the start of the week.

536
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,270
Why? Was there water in the gas?

537
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:57,830
Georges is in a trade union.

538
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:00,510
He questioned many things.
Mr. Luc got tired.

539
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:02,110
Yes, I think he drank.

540
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:04,110
Mr. Thibaut even noticed it,

541
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,310
and he told Mr. Luc.

542
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:07,510
Do you call him Mr. Luc?

543
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:09,310
Yes. I knew his father too.

544
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,110
Yes?

545
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:12,110
This establishment
is a family affair.

546
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:14,510
He inherited the hotel,
vowed his life to it.

547
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:15,910
And his wife?

548
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,510
Everything she does is for him.

549
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:20,230
Rarely have I seen
such a devoted wife.

550
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:22,110
In any case, the trade union member,

551
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,950
did someone see him here yesterday?

552
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,390
I saw him late afternoon, at closing.

553
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:28,390
He wanted to pick up his tools.

554
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:30,110
His toolbox?

555
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:33,510
Your thing is too hot.

556
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:35,830
Still, I am not a lobster, Christ.

557
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:39,030
Is there something to cool the meat,
after the double boiler?

558
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,030
I'm out. Too hot!

559
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,950
It's freezing!

560
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:00,830
Captain?

561
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,230
What's going on here?

562
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:06,190
After the widow Pinocchio,

563
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:09,110
we visit the syndicate
of drinkers and boozers.

564
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,670
Syndicated colleagues, hello.

565
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:13,110
National gendarmerie.
Captain Marleau.

566
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:16,470
I am looking for a plumber.

567
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:20,230
I was told I could find the king
of toilet de-blockers here.

568
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:21,950
Do you know a certain Jojo?

569
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:23,670
No, I do not think so.

570
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:24,550
No?

571
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,830
There is no Jojo here?

572
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:28,950
Georges. My name is Georges.

573
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:31,630
Jojo is for my friends.

574
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:32,830
And how is Georges?

575
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:33,830
Okay.

576
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:36,030
Does he know a certain Marin?

577
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:39,670
Yes, I opened the machine room
at the Thalasso for him.

578
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:40,750
Three days ago.

579
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:44,830
With those idlers, drunk on cash,

580
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,190
wasn't harming anyone.

581
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:47,830
Well, I thought.

582
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:50,390
But at the same time,
I imagine you like

583
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:52,550
pissing off your ex-bosses?

584
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:53,750
Yeah.

585
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,110
They booted me out like a leper.

586
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:57,950
Didn't even get my tools.

587
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:59,830
I looked all over, didn't find them.

588
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,670
I worked seven years in this hotel.

589
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:07,670
Without counting the whole year's
training for this Thalasso crap.

590
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:10,270
Crappy Thalasso. All that, why?

591
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:13,110
Surely due to a penchant for tea?

592
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:17,830
Careful. I never drank
a drop at work.

593
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:21,190
That's not what Mr. Thibaut
said to Mr. Férey.

594
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,550
Mr. Thibaut?

595
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:24,950
That was him?

596
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,550
Yes, apparently.

597
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:29,110
That does not surprise me.

598
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:31,990
The cash-stuffed, bloated hypocrite.

599
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,710
If you say so.

600
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:38,710
Do you know why
the boss got told that crap?

601
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:41,110
Surely because
you are a trade unionist.

602
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:43,110
That too, surely.

603
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:46,110
But it's mainly because
I caught him with Mr. Luc's wife.

604
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,630
How so?

605
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:51,830
I caught them together
in the Thalasso one evening.

606
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:54,070
Pretended it was nothing,
but I'm not blind!

607
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:58,670
He was groping her, little Miléna.

608
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:00,950
And did you tell Mr. Férey?

609
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,190
Have you seen me?

610
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:04,990
-I look guilty as sin?
-A little.

611
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:07,070
-Take care of yourself!
-Yes.

612
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:10,390
I shut my mouth very well!

613
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,390
Maybe I'd better open it.

614
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:17,830
What were you doing Thursday night?

615
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:21,390
I was visiting my mother.
She has Alzheimer's.

616
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:25,110
So in terms of testimony,
don't count too much on her.

617
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:28,430
I'll go back, this beer's bad.

618
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:29,830
That is a good idea.

619
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,550
Brière, what are you drinking?

620
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:33,550
-The same thing.
-The same thing.

621
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,110
What do you think?

622
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:38,630
But I don't think, Brière, I observe.

623
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:40,550
And when fruit is ripe, it falls.

624
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:43,270
And who picks it up? Me.

625
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:44,550
It's good, this beer?

626
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,990
Yes, that's him. A big guy.

627
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:49,550
He opened the door
so that I could sleep there.

628
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:50,830
And the wallet?

629
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:51,990
I told you ten times.

630
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:54,550
The wallet
was on the patio in a coat,

631
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:56,350
and I stole it, I went through it.

632
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:57,550
That's all.

633
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:00,630
Except that the man in question
died that night.

634
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:02,350
I was inside. Didn't move.

635
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:06,070
Okay, let's admit.

636
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:10,510
That night, you didn't
notice anything odd?

637
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,990
Rack your brains!

638
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:15,270
If you don't help me,
I can't help you.

639
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:18,270
Once, I went out to pee.

640
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,390
And I saw a woman
run by the Thalasso.

641
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,990
Are you sure it was a woman?

642
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:24,390
If not, then a tranny with heels.

643
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:26,670
Does that make you laugh?

644
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,270
Give me my cigarette?

645
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:32,070
No! I don't fatten up
cigarette sellers.

646
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:36,590
I don't like trannyphobes.

647
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:38,550
So bring on your own lung cancer.

648
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:40,870
There it is.

649
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:43,150
Yes, hello?

650
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:44,550
Hello.

651
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:47,790
I'd like to know if Coralie Mons
still works here?

652
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:50,270
Why? Who's asking?

653
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:51,990
Garance, Garance Thibaut.

654
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:54,510
I really need to talk to her.

655
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:56,790
It's...

656
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:29,430
Excuse me, have you seen
Captain Marleau?

657
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,950
Monsieur!

658
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:47,430
Captain? So, are we relaxing?

659
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:49,590
No, I am thinking.

660
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:52,310
I thought you were
doing interrogations.

661
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,790
That's what I'm doing!

662
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:56,590
I have to do
transcendental meditation.

663
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:59,670
To know the human condition.

664
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:01,150
I have the autopsy report.

665
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:03,750
What does it say?

666
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,550
The death was between
midnight and 3 a.m.

667
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:09,270
He died as a result of
several blows to the head.

668
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,710
It's likely with a hammer.

669
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,110
Yes?

670
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:14,310
Residue of metal and wood in the cut.

671
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:16,150
High alcohol level.

672
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:18,870
Certain sexual activity
just before death.

673
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:21,430
Presence of foreign hairs
under DNA analysis.

674
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:26,270
Paul Thibaut possessed the hotel.

675
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,710
How is that?

676
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:32,750
A month ago he injected money
to save the Féreys from bankruptcy.

677
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:34,830
The Thalasso cost them a fortune.

678
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:36,470
Without him, they were done.

679
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,390
He is generous, this guy.

680
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:40,830
Generous, but dead. And his son?

681
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:44,430
Clément, 28 years old. Has been
living in Cameroon for over a year.

682
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,230
I bet all you want

683
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:48,030
that he musn't be so far away.

684
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:50,550
Can we slow down a bit

685
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:51,950
because I don't feel well?

686
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:54,030
So, my little nutcracker,

687
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:57,150
are you going to puke?
Okay, we'll slow down!

688
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:16,270
How long has it been
since you last had

689
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:18,590
intimate relations with your husband?

690
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:22,110
My husband collected mistresses
as others do stamps.

691
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:25,110
His powers of seduction
were without limit.

692
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:28,310
For years, he had the grace
to hide it and then...

693
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,590
time passed.

694
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:32,150
A sort of DSK.

695
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:33,750
And your son?

696
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:36,470
Clément? When did you last see him?

697
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:37,550
A long time ago.

698
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:39,190
It's true he lives in Africa.

699
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:42,990
You didn't see him in the hotel
gardens the night of the murder?

700
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:45,590
It's been more than a year
since I've seen my son.

701
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:48,110
That's a long time.
How did that happen?

702
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:49,150
Not your concern.

703
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,670
Why so many questions?

704
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:53,470
I thought you found the culprit.

705
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:56,190
And leaving a kid to rot in prison
for a crime

706
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:58,470
he may not have done.
Does that bother you?

707
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,710
I have a show to prepare.

708
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:04,550
And I'd like to get back to work.

709
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:08,390
Well, yeah... "Show must go on",
as that person sang.

710
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:10,590
Eddy Mitchell.
Madam Thibaut,

711
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:15,150
your son will hit the jackpot
with the death of his father?

712
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:16,470
It is a good alibi.

713
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:18,470
How dare you? I forbid you to--

714
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:20,190
Calm down, Garance, please.

715
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:23,750
The last few weeks
have been gruelling.

716
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:25,270
We would like some calm.

717
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:27,750
Have we been introduced, Sir?

718
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:29,310
He is Vladimir Lipinski,

719
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:31,390
a great dancer/choreographer.

720
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:33,750
I was lucky to see his Paris ballet

721
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:35,470
five years ago. It was magical.

722
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:36,750
Thank you.

723
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:39,270
My company will dance in Strasbourg
next week.

724
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:40,390
Can I invite you?

725
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,630
Thank you, that's kind.

726
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:48,030
Let's go, Brière.
"Les balais brosses", it's over.

727
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,430
I assure you,
he's a great choreographer.

728
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:00,910
Captain.

729
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:03,310
I have known Garance for years.

730
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:05,910
She'd have been a great dancer
if not for Paul.

731
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:08,310
She is a rare woman.
A beautiful person.

732
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:09,710
All the better for her.

733
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:12,910
I may dance like a potato,
but I have one big talent: my nose.

734
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,590
I smell lies a mile off.

735
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:17,030
Cyrano, next to me
is Michael Jackson!

736
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:21,590
Brière, can you stop
playing the raccoon?

737
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,030
It's not that.

738
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:35,630
-You don't get it?
-Yes.

739
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:37,990
You don't get that this deal
with Paul,

740
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,590
we are at his heirs' mercy.

741
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:41,910
And that if Garance
wants to sell the hotel

742
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:45,030
we cannot do anything?
We will lose everything, Miléna!

743
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:46,630
That will not happen.

744
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:48,550
How do you know that?

745
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,030
I will not let it happen.

746
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:55,990
I've always backed you.

747
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:58,350
I've always been by your side.

748
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,630
And this hotel is our project.

749
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:02,270
I won't let anyone interfere.

750
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:03,270
Believe me!

751
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:08,190
What would I do without you.

752
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:09,470
Do not worry.

753
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:12,070
We will get through this.
I promise you.

754
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:13,470
Yes.

755
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:17,910
I want a drink.

756
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:38,790
You know what? I want you.

757
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:41,870
Here?

758
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:46,790
Yes. Here, now. Right now.

759
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:50,470
Wait two seconds.

760
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:21,310
Clément, I have to talk to you.
Please call me back!

761
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:26,230
Yes?

762
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:29,630
It's Luc. May I come in?

763
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:30,750
Yes.

764
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:35,190
I wanted to...

765
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:38,790
I wanted to say again
how much Miléna and I--

766
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:39,870
You have, Luc.

767
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:41,790
But you should know

768
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:43,950
that Paul's death didn't cause
me great pain.

769
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:48,630
If you need anything, whatever it is,

770
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:50,790
don't hesitate. You can count on us.

771
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:54,750
My husband appreciated you a lot.

772
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:59,230
Let's say that without him,
we'd have been in great difficulty.

773
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:00,630
And with him too, I think.

774
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:01,870
Pardon me?

775
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:02,710
Be clear.

776
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:04,870
If Paul invested
in your establishment,

777
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:07,070
it's because he recognized
a good deal.

778
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:07,910
Yes.

779
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:10,790
I do not yet know
the ins and outs of your deal.

780
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:12,430
I imagine your hands are tied.

781
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,750
And you're no longer the master,
is that right?

782
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:17,750
Once Paul is buried,

783
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:21,070
I will sell
to the highest bidder, Luc.

784
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:22,030
Pardon me?

785
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:23,630
I don't want a hotel.

786
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:26,950
I will invest
in what deeply animates me.

787
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:31,870
Garance, I think--

788
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:33,590
I need to rest.

789
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:43,070
Thank you for your condolences.

790
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:45,510
They go straight to my heart.

791
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:08,590
What did she say to you?

792
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:10,190
Nothing.

793
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:11,750
Tell me, Luc?

794
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:15,070
She will chuck us out.

795
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:18,590
What? That's not true!

796
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:19,910
She'll take the best price.

797
00:45:20,110 --> 00:45:22,510
And I assure you
she'll enjoy doing it.

798
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:23,910
No, she won't do that!

799
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:26,670
Yes? Why?

800
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:28,510
What do you want us to do?

801
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:29,870
You have an idea?

802
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:33,510
Listen, nobody will take this hotel.
Do you hear me, Luc? Nobody!

803
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:36,110
So we will find a solution,
don't worry!

804
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:39,630
Don't worry,
we will find a solution.

805
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:43,830
And go!

806
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:51,830
Spot on! Careful!

807
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:25,670
If we lose the hotel,
it'll kill Luc. Get it?

808
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:27,110
I don't know where she is.

809
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:29,550
And even if I did know,
I wouldn't tell you.

810
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:31,670
You're friends.
You've known her for ages.

811
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:32,950
Yes.

812
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:34,310
Try to talk to her.

813
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:35,350
Listen, Madam--

814
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:36,550
No, Miléna.

815
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:39,950
Garance is a big girl.
She can do whatever she wants.

816
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:44,350
So, ensure your friend
gets the message:

817
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:46,110
if she wants war, she'll have it.

818
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:48,790
Because I will do anything
for the man I love.

819
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:02,350
You were right.

820
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:04,790
The Thibaut son is in France.

821
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:08,070
His passport was checked at Roissy
four days ago from Cameroon.

822
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:09,830
Do you see what I was saying?

823
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:12,230
I have better still.

824
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:15,990
Careful, Brière!
You'll get a promotion!

825
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:17,830
And I think that I can say

826
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:19,510
why he went so far away.

827
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,550
Is it a love story?

828
00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:25,550
Yeah, that's it.
His girlfriend chucked him.

829
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:26,910
My dad told me.

830
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:28,150
How's your dad know?

831
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:31,990
The girl's parents are clients
at the butcher's.

832
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:35,350
Last year, her mother came in
to buy cutlets, in floods of tears.

833
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:38,150
For her, it was a tragedy
her daughter'd never get over.

834
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:41,270
"There goes the money,"
she may as well have said.

835
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:42,790
It's familial prostitution.

836
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:46,590
Either the girl is lucid
or she's crazy.

837
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:49,270
But I do know one thing.

838
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:50,150
What?

839
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:51,830
-Her name is--
-Coralie Mons.

840
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:53,630
No! How do you know that?

841
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:56,390
Because the Thibaut's son
was getting married.

842
00:47:56,590 --> 00:47:59,830
He published the banns. I saw them
on the town hall's website.

843
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:01,470
Not funny, Captain.

844
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:05,070
No, I'm not funny.
I am ugly, but I am intelligent.

845
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:48,830
What?

846
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:51,270
We have to talk, Coralie.
It's important.

847
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:53,030
I have nothing to say.

848
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:55,430
I want you to stop harassing
my dad over the phone.

849
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:57,830
Only reason that I came. That clear?

850
00:48:58,070 --> 00:49:00,830
Do you have any news from Clément
recently?

851
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:03,030
It's important! Do you understand?

852
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:04,990
He's my son. My only son.

853
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:09,150
No, I haven't seen him since.

854
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:14,270
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, not bad.

855
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:16,550
I... I...

856
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:19,830
A glass of water maybe.

857
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:24,030
Come in?

858
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:25,150
If I come in,

859
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:28,430
I'll ask you to tell me
what happened last year,

860
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:29,510
with Paul.

861
00:49:58,110 --> 00:49:59,670
Doesn't look like I'm first.

862
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:42,470
Is there someone there?

863
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:45,590
I'm sorry, we're closed all week.

864
00:50:45,790 --> 00:50:48,150
Even for a little sandwich?

865
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:50,150
-It's just me.
-Go on!

866
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:52,990
I can make you up
a plate of charcuterie,

867
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:54,190
but I have no bread.

868
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:57,990
Very good! No big deal,
nothing wrong with pork.

869
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:02,750
Are you Coralie?

870
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:06,110
Yes, why? Do I know you?

871
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:10,110
No, I am Captain Marleau.

872
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:11,670
What is it?

873
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:13,190
A draught beer.

874
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:23,310
-Here you are!
-Thank you.

875
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:26,750
Did you call off the marriage
with Clement last year?

876
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:28,190
What's it to you?

877
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:29,710
Long since you've seen him?

878
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:33,230
Since he left for Africa?

879
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:36,150
Separation is hard.

880
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:38,110
Especially when you're in love.

881
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:39,310
Never really goes.

882
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:41,870
By the by, my gran said,
"Lose one, lose one."

883
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:43,870
I'd like to close.

884
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:45,710
All right.

885
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:50,270
I imagine Garance Thibaut
asked you the same question.

886
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:54,590
She is scared for her child.

887
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:56,710
You know her husband just died?

888
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:58,430
That doesn't affect me.

889
00:51:58,590 --> 00:52:00,270
And why is that?

890
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:02,590
When a predator disappears,
nature recovers.

891
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:08,150
I like your shoes.
Your heels are pretty.

892
00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:08,910
Thank you.

893
00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:10,870
What did you do Thursday evening?

894
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:14,270
I was on the train.
I live in Strasbourg.

895
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:17,070
I arrived that evening
to see my mum in hospital.

896
00:52:17,230 --> 00:52:19,070
Very good.

897
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:22,030
I will leave you. I'm not hungry
and I don't eat meat.

898
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:24,870
In any case, I will
leave you my number.

899
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:27,750
That way, should you
find your tongue,

900
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:30,590
or if you have news of your ex,

901
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:33,870
call me. Okay? There we are!

902
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:39,310
I will rush because
I'm double parked.

903
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:41,750
I don't want to get a fine.

904
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:42,750
See you soon!

905
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:50,430
You've forgotten your shoes,
Captain?

906
00:53:50,590 --> 00:53:52,790
No, they didn't have them in a 42.

907
00:53:55,550 --> 00:53:57,430
Have you seen
Roland Petit's ballet?

908
00:53:57,550 --> 00:53:58,870
Who's that?

909
00:53:58,990 --> 00:54:00,590
A marvellous choreographer!

910
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:03,510
I was lucky to start with him
when I was a young dancer.

911
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:05,190
Petit loved beauty.

912
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:08,470
I thought he was
Zizi Jeanmaire's lover.

913
00:54:09,230 --> 00:54:11,470
That's a nice formula.
Beauty Thibaut.

914
00:54:11,630 --> 00:54:13,430
The polar opposite of my husband.

915
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:15,510
All he wanted to do was possess.

916
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,030
That cost me therapy.

917
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:19,310
Why did you marry him then?

918
00:54:20,110 --> 00:54:23,710
At 30, when he looked at me I felt
like I was the center of the world.

919
00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:26,750
He was handsome, thoughtful,
ambitious.

920
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:29,310
Ever been crazy in love, Captain?

921
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:33,150
Not really.

922
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:36,470
Time passes and people change.

923
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:40,870
Success, power, money...

924
00:54:40,990 --> 00:54:44,190
All that turns heads.

925
00:54:44,350 --> 00:54:46,190
And reveals people's characters.

926
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:48,350
Excuse me.

927
00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:51,910
-Mrs. Thibaut?
-Yes?

928
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:55,470
What happened between
your husband and Coralie?

929
00:54:56,670 --> 00:54:57,910
Who's talked about her?

930
00:54:58,990 --> 00:55:00,190
Are you following me?

931
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:03,350
No. Shall we make a deal?

932
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:07,790
I'll stop playing Colombo,
and you tell me the truth. Agreed?

933
00:55:09,230 --> 00:55:11,910
One night, Coralie
was alone here by the pool.

934
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:16,350
My husband got back
from New York. Thank you.

935
00:55:16,510 --> 00:55:19,790
She told me she'd even thought
of bringing him a gift.

936
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:21,630
As thanks,
she jumps into his arms.

937
00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:24,350
He offered her a drink, then two.

938
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:28,070
Then he finished
by trying to kiss her.

939
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:30,750
So Coralie pushed him away.

940
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:35,350
Paul laughed like it was nothing,
like it was not important.

941
00:55:35,510 --> 00:55:39,230
In fact, for him, seducing a woman
became a game with no consequences.

942
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:41,070
A game?

943
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:42,790
Rape is not a game.

944
00:55:43,830 --> 00:55:47,190
He turned into a big pig,
the old father-in-law, that it?

945
00:55:47,390 --> 00:55:48,470
When Clément got in,

946
00:55:48,670 --> 00:55:51,390
Coralie had left the house
without explanation.

947
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:54,150
So what did he do?

948
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:56,470
The next day he went to see her.

949
00:55:56,670 --> 00:55:59,470
And Coralie finished
by confessing in tears

950
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:03,470
that she had slept with his dad.

951
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:05,950
And he left that same day
without a word.

952
00:56:06,110 --> 00:56:07,470
To Cameroon?

953
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:13,470
Today, he works in a pepper factory.

954
00:56:13,630 --> 00:56:15,350
In fair trade.

955
00:56:16,270 --> 00:56:18,030
Fair, well that's an idea

956
00:56:18,190 --> 00:56:20,910
that's never crossed
his father's mind.

957
00:56:23,310 --> 00:56:27,390
And what burdens are there
in his mother's mind?

958
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:28,790
Me? Nothing!

959
00:56:29,390 --> 00:56:31,750
My eyes had been closed
for a long time.

960
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:39,670
And then, Clément leaving
was like an electric shock.

961
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:42,310
Suddenly, I saw Paul
exactly as he was.

962
00:56:42,470 --> 00:56:44,790
I realized I hadn't loved him
for a long time.

963
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:47,070
It was over.

964
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:51,910
And then three months ago
I saw Vladimir dance in Milan.

965
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:54,670
And I awoke as if
from a long sleep.

966
00:56:56,950 --> 00:56:59,470
And Sleeping Beauty
ran to Coralie's house

967
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:02,790
to ask her if she knew where
to find her charming son, that it?

968
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:06,190
Because in fact, your son did come
to see you on Thursday night.

969
00:57:06,350 --> 00:57:07,790
At the hotel?

970
00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:14,510
I said I've not seen him
in over a year.

971
00:57:15,150 --> 00:57:19,190
Liar. You're lying, Garance.
Your nose is growing.

972
00:57:19,910 --> 00:57:21,670
Know what I think? You're scared.

973
00:57:21,870 --> 00:57:23,750
You are scared for your son.

974
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:28,070
Scared he'll do something stupid,
Œdipus style.

975
00:57:28,230 --> 00:57:30,390
There is no need to be Dolto
to understand.

976
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:32,190
Am I wrong?

977
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:40,790
Yes?

978
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:45,030
What's happening?

979
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:47,230
Captain Marleau sent me.

980
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:49,510
-Yes, and?
-She's at the Thalasso.

981
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:52,070
-The pool?
-She asked me to get you.

982
00:57:53,590 --> 00:57:54,790
What does she want?

983
00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:57,070
I don't know.
She asked me to tell you.

984
00:57:59,230 --> 00:58:01,230
As if I don't have enough problems.

985
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:05,910
When I just see cancellation emails
for three days, I have vertigo.

986
00:58:07,310 --> 00:58:09,230
We're not out of the woods.

987
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:16,910
-There she is.
-I saw her.

988
00:58:20,270 --> 00:58:21,230
Thank you.

989
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:25,750
Mr. Férey.

990
00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:26,630
Any trouble?

991
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:29,510
Yes. I have questions.

992
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:30,630
I'm listening.

993
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:32,790
I'm cold,
I will swim a little.

994
00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:44,910
-So?
-So,

995
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:47,710
was it you that sacked Jojo?

996
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:49,630
Yes, it was me.

997
00:58:49,790 --> 00:58:52,350
It seems that Mr. Thibaut
asked you to do it?

998
00:58:52,550 --> 00:58:55,630
Paul highlighted his alcoholism,
that is more accurate.

999
00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:57,270
But it's not the only reason.

1000
00:58:57,470 --> 00:59:00,550
What other reasons were there?
You don't like syndicalists?

1001
00:59:03,350 --> 00:59:05,430
You know,
we are a small business.

1002
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:08,310
I think it's better
to resolve issues ourselves.

1003
00:59:08,470 --> 00:59:10,790
And it seems the staff
don't complain.

1004
00:59:10,990 --> 00:59:14,510
That's good!
They won't come and complain,

1005
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:17,350
if they'll get the sack after.

1006
00:59:18,830 --> 00:59:22,630
They're really beautiful,
these pools. They're lovely!

1007
00:59:22,830 --> 00:59:24,350
But that must cost a lot.

1008
00:59:24,550 --> 00:59:26,510
Was it Mr. Thibaut who covered it?

1009
00:59:26,990 --> 00:59:27,790
How?

1010
00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:30,790
Is Mr. Thibaut the owner now?

1011
00:59:31,990 --> 00:59:34,910
It is not that simple.
I've kept the position of--

1012
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:36,190
Don't care. He's dead.

1013
00:59:36,350 --> 00:59:39,630
Now that he lives on
the boulevard of death,

1014
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:41,910
his widow now holds the reins

1015
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:44,790
of the business. Garance, that it?

1016
00:59:46,990 --> 00:59:50,070
Was it you or your wife
that convinced Mr. Thibaut

1017
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:53,230
to invest in "Aqualand"?

1018
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:54,990
I don't think I understand.

1019
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:59,430
Which one out of you two
used their charms

1020
00:59:59,590 --> 01:00:01,950
to save your hotel?

1021
01:00:02,150 --> 01:00:04,630
Miléna and I have
been married for 20 years.

1022
01:00:07,790 --> 01:00:11,070
We are still very much
in love with one another.

1023
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:12,150
Well done!

1024
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:15,510
At the same time, I understand,
she is good.

1025
01:00:16,510 --> 01:00:18,430
I'm talking about the water.

1026
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:20,350
A little bit hot, but good.

1027
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:23,670
You'd be pissed to lose all of that.

1028
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:25,710
What are you trying to insinuate?

1029
01:00:25,870 --> 01:00:27,950
Nothing, never mind.

1030
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:30,710
In fact,

1031
01:00:32,110 --> 01:00:34,870
do you know where Jojo's tools are?

1032
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:36,510
What tools?

1033
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:37,870
His tools!

1034
01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:40,070
He got fired,
he can't pick up his tools.

1035
01:00:40,310 --> 01:00:42,150
He needs them.
You know where they are?

1036
01:00:42,310 --> 01:00:43,070
I know nothing!

1037
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:45,670
No, I don't know!

1038
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:48,150
A big toolbox disappears
just like that!

1039
01:00:48,910 --> 01:00:50,070
It's a bit shady.

1040
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:52,350
Well listen,
if he's really lost them,

1041
01:00:52,510 --> 01:00:54,070
I will reimburse him.

1042
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:57,710
That's nice! You know
how the proletarians are.

1043
01:00:58,470 --> 01:01:01,230
As they say, "A good workman
is someone with good tools,"

1044
01:01:01,430 --> 01:01:03,070
so he wants his own tools back.

1045
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:05,230
It'd be good to sort out

1046
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:07,670
him getting back his big toolbox.

1047
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:11,230
We could call it a severance payment,

1048
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:14,430
seeing how now
there are no more labor laws.

1049
01:01:15,030 --> 01:01:17,670
Accroche à ton cœur...

1050
01:01:17,830 --> 01:01:20,230
Un morceau de chiffon rouge...

1051
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:52,950
What's up?

1052
01:01:53,190 --> 01:01:54,790
Pardon me, sorry...
I scared you?

1053
01:01:55,710 --> 01:01:56,390
Yes.

1054
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:57,670
I am looking for tools.

1055
01:01:58,350 --> 01:01:59,510
Georges' tools?

1056
01:01:59,670 --> 01:02:01,510
Yes. Mr. Luc asked me to find them.

1057
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:03,030
Listen, I think these days

1058
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:04,790
we have other things to do, right?

1059
01:02:05,270 --> 01:02:06,510
Yes, of course.

1060
01:02:06,670 --> 01:02:08,230
So go back home.

1061
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:11,390
As long as there are no clients
it's no use being here.

1062
01:02:11,550 --> 01:02:12,390
Right?

1063
01:02:12,630 --> 01:02:13,950
-Yes, Madam
-Thank you.

1064
01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:20,950
I looked for you.

1065
01:02:21,190 --> 01:02:23,390
Elementary, my dear Brière!

1066
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:24,790
The kid ran away.

1067
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:25,790
What kid?

1068
01:02:26,030 --> 01:02:27,790
Marin. When we got
to the courthouse,

1069
01:02:27,990 --> 01:02:30,390
he asked to go to the toilets
and escaped.

1070
01:02:30,990 --> 01:02:32,590
But no, what an idiot!

1071
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:34,070
We've got roadblocks up.

1072
01:02:34,670 --> 01:02:36,230
Comissioner wants helicopters.

1073
01:02:36,430 --> 01:02:38,590
But well, he is
incandescent with rage.

1074
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:42,950
What an idiot. They'll kill him,
the trigger happy cowboys.

1075
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:44,590
And another thing.

1076
01:02:44,790 --> 01:02:47,590
We got the DNA results
on the hair found on Thibaut.

1077
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:48,670
And?

1078
01:02:48,830 --> 01:02:51,510
Nothing on file.
We just know it's a woman's hair.

1079
01:02:51,670 --> 01:02:54,950
Seeing the pedigree of
the old charmer, it's hardly a scoop.

1080
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:56,670
What are we doing?

1081
01:02:56,910 --> 01:02:58,230
Move your ass, Brière!

1082
01:02:58,350 --> 01:02:59,670
What should we do?

1083
01:02:59,790 --> 01:03:00,950
You're funny.

1084
01:03:01,150 --> 01:03:03,310
In any case, when the fruit is ripe

1085
01:03:03,470 --> 01:03:04,390
and doesn't fall,

1086
01:03:04,590 --> 01:03:06,630
we give the palm tree
a good, hard kick.

1087
01:03:06,790 --> 01:03:07,590
Not the season.

1088
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:09,110
Yeah, but we're in Alsace!

1089
01:03:27,030 --> 01:03:28,790
I saw this one coming.

1090
01:03:28,990 --> 01:03:31,510
I'll bet my head
she's going to kiss him.

1091
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:32,790
Voilà!

1092
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:37,790
Goodbye, my charming heir.

1093
01:03:38,830 --> 01:03:40,510
I will join you later.

1094
01:04:23,710 --> 01:04:26,510
I will get you from behind,
you won't be disappointed.

1095
01:06:04,830 --> 01:06:07,830
Nadia Comaneci ,1976!

1096
01:06:12,310 --> 01:06:13,230
Have to start yoga.

1097
01:06:16,030 --> 01:06:18,390
Jeannie Longo, 1985!

1098
01:06:18,590 --> 01:06:22,390
Go on, Marleau! Go on, Marleau!

1099
01:06:22,550 --> 01:06:25,870
Go on! Go on! Go on!

1100
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:09,110
No, I didn't see him that night.

1101
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:11,270
How could I know he came?

1102
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:12,030
You swear?

1103
01:07:12,590 --> 01:07:14,270
Don't you trust me?

1104
01:07:15,950 --> 01:07:17,270
You think I killed him?

1105
01:07:17,390 --> 01:07:18,550
Je te demande pardon.

1106
01:07:18,950 --> 01:07:20,670
I am sorry.

1107
01:07:20,830 --> 01:07:22,670
If you knew how scared I was.

1108
01:07:22,870 --> 01:07:23,950
Scared of what?

1109
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:26,750
Losing you again.
This time, I would not survive it.

1110
01:07:27,150 --> 01:07:28,390
Of course you would.

1111
01:07:28,790 --> 01:07:31,550
You're tough.
Today, I don't need you anymore.

1112
01:07:31,950 --> 01:07:33,310
You can't say that.

1113
01:07:33,470 --> 01:07:35,550
Everything I do is for you.
Everything!

1114
01:07:35,670 --> 01:07:37,670
I dance now,
to meet your expectations.

1115
01:07:37,830 --> 01:07:38,830
It's too late.

1116
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:48,110
I felt betrayed, Mom.

1117
01:07:48,870 --> 01:07:49,550
I know.

1118
01:07:49,790 --> 01:07:51,470
At first, I hated them both.

1119
01:07:52,030 --> 01:07:55,190
Then, I wondered how she could have
managed to push him away.

1120
01:07:55,350 --> 01:07:57,190
Him! The father figure.

1121
01:07:57,710 --> 01:07:59,830
He who turned
all my female friends' heads.

1122
01:07:59,990 --> 01:08:01,230
It's not her fault.

1123
01:08:03,150 --> 01:08:04,550
He abused her.

1124
01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:06,830
She didn't succumb to his charm.

1125
01:08:06,990 --> 01:08:10,110
He made her drink and behaved
like the worst bastard.

1126
01:08:14,030 --> 01:08:16,190
I would not spit on his grave,

1127
01:08:16,390 --> 01:08:18,270
but today I know
I'm no longer his son.

1128
01:08:32,350 --> 01:08:33,110
Crap.

1129
01:08:59,310 --> 01:09:01,990
Come here!

1130
01:09:02,150 --> 01:09:03,390
Are you Clément Thibaut?

1131
01:09:04,470 --> 01:09:06,110
Yes. What do you want from me?

1132
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:08,550
A little walk in the woods?
No, I'm joking.

1133
01:09:08,710 --> 01:09:12,270
Captain Marleau,
national gendarmerie.

1134
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:15,110
Are you disappointed?

1135
01:09:15,270 --> 01:09:18,550
Would you prefer a walk in the woods?

1136
01:09:23,750 --> 01:09:24,990
I saw nothing that night.

1137
01:09:26,110 --> 01:09:28,390
I left my mom, I went into town.

1138
01:09:28,550 --> 01:09:29,710
Just wanted to drink.

1139
01:09:30,230 --> 01:09:31,190
You got drunk?

1140
01:09:32,790 --> 01:09:35,110
No, I went to see her.

1141
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:36,390
Who, Coralie?

1142
01:09:38,350 --> 01:09:40,190
-Captain?
-Brière, what's going on?

1143
01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:43,990
I was told about a prowler
at Bois de Sambre on the D23.

1144
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:45,390
Do you think it's Marin?

1145
01:09:45,590 --> 01:09:47,430
The description seems to match.

1146
01:09:47,630 --> 01:09:48,550
What shall we do?

1147
01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:50,270
Nothing! Don't mention it!

1148
01:09:50,430 --> 01:09:52,390
Where is the bois?

1149
01:09:52,550 --> 01:09:53,390
Six miles higher.

1150
01:09:53,550 --> 01:09:54,990
Thank you, Brière!

1151
01:10:17,470 --> 01:10:18,510
Crap!

1152
01:10:19,710 --> 01:10:21,030
Fuck!

1153
01:10:24,590 --> 01:10:25,790
Marin?

1154
01:10:27,630 --> 01:10:29,390
Marin? It's me.

1155
01:10:30,430 --> 01:10:33,070
It's Marleau. Can you hear me?

1156
01:10:35,230 --> 01:10:38,510
Come back, Marin!
This is not a joke!

1157
01:10:39,590 --> 01:10:41,670
There are Ninja Turtles
out looking for you!

1158
01:10:43,230 --> 01:10:45,310
They get you before me,
they'll take you out.

1159
01:10:46,350 --> 01:10:47,510
Marin!

1160
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:48,950
Who we after?

1161
01:10:49,510 --> 01:10:50,830
A poor kid.

1162
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:53,110
Not born on the right side.

1163
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:56,670
He is part of the Gotha Ghetto
as Pinçon-Charlot would say.

1164
01:10:57,150 --> 01:10:57,950
What did he do?

1165
01:10:58,670 --> 01:11:00,390
He's accused of
your father's murder.

1166
01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:02,830
What?
And you think it was him who...

1167
01:11:03,070 --> 01:11:06,230
I don't think anything,
no more him than you, by the way.

1168
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:10,310
Except there's a smear on his name.
You hear that, Marin?

1169
01:11:13,470 --> 01:11:15,670
Marin, respond!

1170
01:11:18,390 --> 01:11:19,750
It's night. He's run off.

1171
01:11:20,990 --> 01:11:24,750
You think?
You're right. I've missed him.

1172
01:11:27,790 --> 01:11:28,830
So then, you.

1173
01:11:29,070 --> 01:11:32,390
Why did you come back from Cameroon?
Is it for Coralie?

1174
01:11:32,510 --> 01:11:34,390
Yes. I needed to talk to her.

1175
01:11:35,110 --> 01:11:37,390
I left like a madman,
trying to forget, but...

1176
01:11:37,550 --> 01:11:40,190
You love her. Is that it?

1177
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:42,390
Exactly. It's as stupid as that.

1178
01:11:42,590 --> 01:11:43,830
But no, it's not stupid.

1179
01:11:44,590 --> 01:11:46,390
It's silly, but it's not stupid.

1180
01:11:46,590 --> 01:11:49,030
Then when someone apologizes,
it's a relief.

1181
01:11:51,070 --> 01:11:53,390
It's not her that apologized,
it was me.

1182
01:11:54,190 --> 01:11:55,110
Ah, yeah?

1183
01:11:56,630 --> 01:11:57,950
And your mom?

1184
01:11:58,830 --> 01:12:01,510
Do you not think
she deserves one too?

1185
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:04,550
Go on, think about it.

1186
01:12:37,950 --> 01:12:39,990
You going forward or back?

1187
01:12:40,190 --> 01:12:42,950
Forward or backward?

1188
01:12:43,190 --> 01:12:45,670
Running on the spot,
it's annoying.

1189
01:12:46,230 --> 01:12:46,950
Want a beer?

1190
01:12:47,190 --> 01:12:49,390
No, I want to go and run.
It'll do me good.

1191
01:13:05,190 --> 01:13:06,110
Move!

1192
01:13:11,670 --> 01:13:12,510
Hello, Captain!

1193
01:13:12,710 --> 01:13:13,830
You okay, Brière?

1194
01:13:15,190 --> 01:13:15,830
Mister.

1195
01:13:16,790 --> 01:13:18,110
Hi, how are you?

1196
01:13:19,470 --> 01:13:20,390
Go on.

1197
01:13:24,550 --> 01:13:25,510
How is it?

1198
01:13:26,710 --> 01:13:28,110
What's happening?

1199
01:13:28,310 --> 01:13:30,470
Police raid, Mr. Férey.

1200
01:13:30,630 --> 01:13:31,990
You already searched it all.

1201
01:13:32,190 --> 01:13:33,830
We will do it again

1202
01:13:34,030 --> 01:13:36,830
but it will not take long.

1203
01:13:41,630 --> 01:13:43,630
Luc? What is happening?

1204
01:13:43,790 --> 01:13:44,990
Perquisition.

1205
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:46,710
What are you looking for?

1206
01:13:47,310 --> 01:13:50,830
The murder weapon. When there is
a murder, there's usually a weapon.

1207
01:13:50,990 --> 01:13:51,990
This is absurd.

1208
01:13:52,150 --> 01:13:54,350
Don't worry, they're trained.
No breakages.

1209
01:13:54,550 --> 01:13:57,630
By the way, I'd like to introduce
Mich. Well, Officer Michel.

1210
01:13:57,830 --> 01:14:00,430
He will supervise
this brilliant search.

1211
01:14:01,510 --> 01:14:02,270
Good day.

1212
01:14:02,470 --> 01:14:04,510
Do you know the chaos
that you are causing?

1213
01:14:04,710 --> 01:14:06,830
Yes, that... Miss,

1214
01:14:07,030 --> 01:14:10,830
tell me, what is
Garance Thibaut's room number?

1215
01:14:11,070 --> 01:14:13,950
-Room 208, Madam.
-208. Thank you very much.

1216
01:14:15,270 --> 01:14:16,070
Okay, let's see.

1217
01:14:16,230 --> 01:14:17,230
And you will do...

1218
01:14:17,390 --> 01:14:18,990
Are you sure you want to do this?

1219
01:14:19,150 --> 01:14:21,510
What do I say, Djokan?

1220
01:14:22,670 --> 01:14:24,350
-We shake the tree.
-And?

1221
01:14:25,150 --> 01:14:28,350
And we take care
not to get hit on the head.

1222
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:43,830
No, I don't want you
to clean the room. Thanks.

1223
01:14:44,270 --> 01:14:46,230
If I leave my hoover in my pocket,

1224
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:47,510
can I come in?

1225
01:14:47,670 --> 01:14:48,990
Come in.

1226
01:14:51,110 --> 01:14:51,990
Hi.

1227
01:14:54,030 --> 01:14:55,110
It's nice here.

1228
01:14:57,230 --> 01:14:58,670
That's funny!

1229
01:14:59,590 --> 01:15:02,830
You carpet's so thick!
Thought I was on the moon.

1230
01:15:03,550 --> 01:15:05,070
Hello, NASA ?

1231
01:15:05,270 --> 01:15:09,590
This is one small step for Marleau,
one giant leap for mankind.

1232
01:15:10,950 --> 01:15:12,430
What's going on?

1233
01:15:12,590 --> 01:15:15,150
Shouldn't you be rehearsing?

1234
01:15:15,390 --> 01:15:16,990
That's not so important anymore.

1235
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:27,710
You know I met your son?

1236
01:15:27,910 --> 01:15:29,870
A handsome little wolf, Clément.

1237
01:15:30,590 --> 01:15:31,870
He knows nothing.

1238
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:33,350
I know that.

1239
01:15:34,110 --> 01:15:37,430
Go on, put some flipflops
and a tutu in a box.

1240
01:15:37,590 --> 01:15:39,150
There's a show waiting for you.

1241
01:15:39,390 --> 01:15:41,110
And there are kids who count on you.

1242
01:15:41,230 --> 01:15:42,950
I do not know if I am...

1243
01:15:43,150 --> 01:15:45,070
Yes, you are! Of course you are!

1244
01:15:45,230 --> 01:15:46,510
Your friend is right.

1245
01:15:46,710 --> 01:15:50,150
The Slav in the leotard.
You are a beautiful person, Garance.

1246
01:15:50,790 --> 01:15:52,390
And you're a funny gendarme.

1247
01:15:55,910 --> 01:15:59,310
Not that I'm annoyed,
but duty calls.

1248
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:04,990
Take care of yourself. Be careful.

1249
01:16:10,710 --> 01:16:13,870
Garance, I didn't tell you,
but I like your name.

1250
01:16:15,950 --> 01:16:16,990
It's a flower.

1251
01:16:17,790 --> 01:16:21,230
But it's also Arletty's character
in les enfants du paradis.

1252
01:16:22,510 --> 01:16:25,150
"Paris est tout petit pour
ceux qui s'aiment

1253
01:16:25,350 --> 01:16:27,870
comme nous d'un
aussi grand amour".

1254
01:16:31,470 --> 01:16:33,270
We're counting on you.

1255
01:16:44,310 --> 01:16:46,150
Vladimir, yes it's me.

1256
01:16:46,390 --> 01:16:48,510
I am sorry I'm late,
but I'm on my way.

1257
01:16:49,430 --> 01:16:51,110
It annoys you to start without me?

1258
01:17:02,110 --> 01:17:03,150
Comrades.

1259
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:11,950
-So Brière?
-Nothing.

1260
01:17:12,110 --> 01:17:13,030
Nothing?

1261
01:17:16,070 --> 01:17:19,870
Okay, so let's pack up.

1262
01:17:21,190 --> 01:17:22,150
It's done!

1263
01:17:23,590 --> 01:17:25,430
-Hamdoulliah!
-Bismillah

1264
01:17:36,270 --> 01:17:39,390
I am disgusted we found nothing.
I hope we didn't ruin the souk.

1265
01:17:39,590 --> 01:17:42,150
Know that we remain
at your complete disposal.

1266
01:17:42,310 --> 01:17:44,430
You can tell your staff

1267
01:17:44,630 --> 01:17:46,150
we will call them in soon...

1268
01:17:46,350 --> 01:17:47,230
Yes.

1269
01:17:47,390 --> 01:17:49,110
...as we await the judge's sanction.

1270
01:17:49,310 --> 01:17:51,950
We will collect saliva samples.
For DNA testing.

1271
01:17:52,110 --> 01:17:53,150
DNA testing?

1272
01:17:53,390 --> 01:17:56,190
We have more than Sherlock Holmes'
magnifying glasses now.

1273
01:17:56,430 --> 01:17:58,830
"Progress doesn't stop," as said...

1274
01:17:58,990 --> 01:18:00,550
I don't know who. We don't care.

1275
01:18:25,190 --> 01:18:27,470
Very good! Super!

1276
01:18:28,350 --> 01:18:32,190
Okay? Yes, carry on.
Good, bigger.

1277
01:19:01,910 --> 01:19:04,030
Are you sure this crap will work?

1278
01:19:04,510 --> 01:19:07,470
I may be an old IT engineer

1279
01:19:08,390 --> 01:19:09,910
but I still know a few tricks.

1280
01:19:13,910 --> 01:19:15,630
And?

1281
01:19:15,870 --> 01:19:19,590
It's true.
You have beautiful relics, you know?

1282
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:22,310
Is what we're doing legal?

1283
01:19:23,870 --> 01:19:26,190
To catch the bad guy
coming out of the woods

1284
01:19:26,350 --> 01:19:27,630
give him the means.

1285
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:29,590
If not, you're like the little girl,

1286
01:19:29,750 --> 01:19:31,030
red coat, pot of butter.

1287
01:19:31,230 --> 01:19:34,150
And you'll do
the Last Tango in Paris.

1288
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:35,750
And now?

1289
01:19:35,910 --> 01:19:37,830
Now, we breathe, we wait.

1290
01:19:40,990 --> 01:19:42,550
Yes, but if nothing happens?

1291
01:19:59,830 --> 01:20:01,350
It's harvest time!

1292
01:20:01,550 --> 01:20:03,070
As Yvette Horner used to say,

1293
01:20:03,310 --> 01:20:06,430
"Play the oboe,
make the accordion sing!"

1294
01:20:59,470 --> 01:21:01,870
-What are you doing here?
-And you?

1295
01:21:02,030 --> 01:21:05,190
Sooner or later,
these masks all fall.

1296
01:21:09,310 --> 01:21:12,310
Crap, my new trousers...

1297
01:21:12,470 --> 01:21:14,470
I always chase the stupid idiots.

1298
01:21:21,670 --> 01:21:23,750
Do not move! Put your hands up!

1299
01:21:23,910 --> 01:21:27,350
Hands up! Stop!
What does that mean?

1300
01:21:28,030 --> 01:21:30,070
-You all right, Brière?
-Yes, Captain.

1301
01:21:30,590 --> 01:21:32,190
It's over, Miléna.

1302
01:21:55,550 --> 01:21:58,070
In two or three days,

1303
01:21:58,230 --> 01:22:00,230
we will get the DNA results back.

1304
01:22:00,790 --> 01:22:02,790
They will surely confirm

1305
01:22:02,990 --> 01:22:05,150
that your hairs
were found on the body.

1306
01:22:05,830 --> 01:22:08,350
And? We ate together.

1307
01:22:08,510 --> 01:22:10,790
Yes. Your hair,

1308
01:22:10,950 --> 01:22:14,750
plus your prints, and the blood

1309
01:22:15,270 --> 01:22:16,790
on Jojo's hammer.

1310
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:20,230
Even if you hire Dupont-Moretti,

1311
01:22:20,390 --> 01:22:22,190
your defense looks pretty bad.

1312
01:22:23,670 --> 01:22:24,550
And?

1313
01:22:27,030 --> 01:22:29,910
What exactly was there
between you and Mr.Thibaut?

1314
01:22:30,470 --> 01:22:34,350
Nothing. There was never
anything between us.

1315
01:22:35,790 --> 01:22:37,470
I love my husband, understand?

1316
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:40,470
I love him so much.

1317
01:22:41,350 --> 01:22:42,950
He's the love of my life, and...

1318
01:22:45,990 --> 01:22:49,350
I didn't want this to happen
like this, I swear!

1319
01:22:50,430 --> 01:22:51,230
Was an accident.

1320
01:22:52,470 --> 01:22:56,430
You know what?
I will make you my princess.

1321
01:22:56,590 --> 01:22:57,950
We can't do this, Paul.

1322
01:22:58,110 --> 01:22:59,230
Why don't you want to?

1323
01:22:59,470 --> 01:23:03,510
I don't know. I just feel lost.
I regret it.

1324
01:23:03,710 --> 01:23:07,350
And the money I invested in
the business, do you regret that too?

1325
01:23:07,550 --> 01:23:08,630
Nothing to do with it.

1326
01:23:08,830 --> 01:23:10,630
What will your husband say?

1327
01:23:10,790 --> 01:23:12,950
When he learns you were my whore?

1328
01:23:13,110 --> 01:23:13,990
Kiss me.

1329
01:23:14,150 --> 01:23:15,070
How dare you?

1330
01:23:15,270 --> 01:23:16,950
Is that not what we've done?

1331
01:23:17,110 --> 01:23:18,230
You are really vile.

1332
01:23:18,390 --> 01:23:20,030
Get off me! No, get off!

1333
01:23:20,190 --> 01:23:22,230
I said come here! Shit!

1334
01:23:22,870 --> 01:23:24,070
See what I'm doing.

1335
01:23:24,270 --> 01:23:26,070
Calling Luc
so he can come join us.

1336
01:23:26,230 --> 01:23:27,390
No, please don't do that!

1337
01:23:27,590 --> 01:23:30,230
I won't be the only one
to suffer like a dog.

1338
01:23:30,470 --> 01:23:32,350
You have reached Luc Férey...

1339
01:23:32,550 --> 01:23:34,350
Give me the telephone!

1340
01:23:58,070 --> 01:23:58,670
Get help!

1341
01:24:02,670 --> 01:24:04,590
Call for help, fuck!

1342
01:24:08,030 --> 01:24:10,070
What are you doing? Stop!

1343
01:25:04,470 --> 01:25:07,630
I really wanted everything
to be how it was before.

1344
01:25:09,750 --> 01:25:11,910
That all that had never happened.

1345
01:25:13,470 --> 01:25:17,230
It's awful for me, for Luc.

1346
01:25:20,430 --> 01:25:21,790
I've screwed everything up.

1347
01:25:24,150 --> 01:25:25,230
You understand?

1348
01:25:25,390 --> 01:25:28,550
No, I don't understand.

1349
01:25:29,630 --> 01:25:31,990
A crime in real life
is not like at the cinema.

1350
01:25:32,190 --> 01:25:35,670
You don't leave saying,
"Get me some popcorn."

1351
01:25:37,150 --> 01:25:40,550
But get out of your bubble!
Real life is out there.

1352
01:25:41,750 --> 01:25:42,590
I pity you.

1353
01:25:47,430 --> 01:25:48,870
Yeah?

1354
01:25:49,070 --> 01:25:51,510
One minute.

1355
01:25:58,430 --> 01:26:00,270
Oh wow!

1356
01:26:00,470 --> 01:26:03,870
One comment, and it's a spin kick
in the plexus!

1357
01:26:04,030 --> 01:26:05,550
You are a beauty, Captain!

1358
01:26:05,750 --> 01:26:07,990
What did I just say? Poucave.

1359
01:26:09,470 --> 01:26:10,870
Who's that there?

1360
01:26:11,670 --> 01:26:14,510
Léon, Zitrone.
Come to heel, dogs!

1361
01:26:17,630 --> 01:26:18,670
No way!

1362
01:26:18,870 --> 01:26:19,590
Look who's back.

1363
01:26:20,150 --> 01:26:21,670
For a guy who dislikes trannys,

1364
01:26:21,830 --> 01:26:22,710
you don't leave the bush.

1365
01:26:24,670 --> 01:26:27,990
I wanted to thank you
for believing in me.

1366
01:26:28,470 --> 01:26:30,430
What do we do with him now?

1367
01:26:30,590 --> 01:26:31,870
We know the score. We go.

1368
01:26:32,070 --> 01:26:34,030
Got holiday.
Take it, won't be long!

1369
01:26:35,550 --> 01:26:36,670
If you're interested,

1370
01:26:36,910 --> 01:26:39,590
I won't lock the door.
There's beer in the freezer.

1371
01:26:40,510 --> 01:26:41,950
Coming? We'll be late.

1372
01:26:42,070 --> 01:26:43,070
Don't like late.

1373
01:26:43,230 --> 01:26:44,750
Nobody asked you.

1374
01:26:48,510 --> 01:26:50,590
GARANCE "PASSIONS"

1375
01:28:40,630 --> 01:28:42,230
It's not the moment,

1376
01:28:42,390 --> 01:28:44,270
but how did you know
it was Mrs. Férey?

1377
01:28:45,190 --> 01:28:48,270
I don't know.
Do you know Jean Marais?

1378
01:28:48,470 --> 01:28:49,990
Jean Marais said,

1379
01:28:50,190 --> 01:28:53,990
"If Lagardère won't come to you,
sort him out so he will!"

1380
01:29:36,390 --> 01:29:38,990
-I love you.
-I am so proud of you!

1381
01:29:52,070 --> 01:29:53,030
Well done!

1382
01:30:51,510 --> 01:30:55,110
Subtitling: Hiventy
