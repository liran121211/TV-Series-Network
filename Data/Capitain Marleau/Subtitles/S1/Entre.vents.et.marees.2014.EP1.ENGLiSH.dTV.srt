1
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,280
Joséphine!

2
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,600
Joséphine, are you there?

3
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,120
Open the door, for God's sake!
I know you're in!

4
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,080
Come on, Jo!

5
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,320
I'm sorry about yesterday.
I was angry.

6
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,400
I didn't mean to hurt you.

7
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,160
I'm sorry. Open up!

8
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,640
I can explain.

9
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,880
Shit.

10
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,280
BETWEEN WINDS AND TIDES

11
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,240
No to the marina!
No to the marina!

12
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,800
No to the marina!
No to the marina!

13
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,880
These fanatics
could scupper the project.

14
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,920
They'll soon tire of screaming.

15
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,240
- No, they're not kids.
- You're right.

16
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,000
Kids wouldn't be such a pain.
A spanking and off to bed!

17
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,200
- You should talk to them.
- And say what?

18
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,080
That it will improve their lives?
That they can play golf

19
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,480
and paddle in the infinity pool?

20
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,480
This marina is a special place.
Do you see?

21
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,080
It's a bridge between sea and land,
between wind and...

22
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,520
Believe me, the guys outside

23
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,880
won't be won over
by your megalomaniac arguments.

24
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,800
Tell them it's going to create
many jobs.

25
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,080
You're aiming to swap their trawlers
for yachts!

26
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,520
They're not stupid.
Everyone knows

27
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,080
the marina isn't a charity!

28
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,440
Everyone can enjoy
the scenery.

29
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,160
Oh, that's good!
That's what you should tell them.

30
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,200
Your clients will throw them
peanuts

31
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,080
over the railings
of your fortified city.

32
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,440
I don't understand you.

33
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,760
Nadia, are you no longer
behind the project?

34
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,240
But of course.
Only I'm not deluding myself.

35
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,440
You're building the Tower of Babel,
I'm preparing the elections.

36
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,800
I don't claim to be doing it
for the good of mankind.

37
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,360
Listen... I still think
you should speak to them.

38
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,960
I don't know... To reassure them.
Meet their spokesperson.

39
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,640
Their spokesperson is your sister.

40
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,800
She's always been a pain.

41
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,480
Even when it comes
to the Christmas menu.

42
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,240
She's a loudmouth.
What can I do about it? Muzzle her?

43
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,800
There's a thought!

44
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,880
Even with a muzzle on

45
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,960
she could bite.

46
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,520
Bastards!

47
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,600
No to the marina!

48
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,520
If the mayor refuses to see us,

49
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,080
we'll smash everything up!

50
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,400
I'll smash everything!

51
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,360
Your sister-in-law can't ignore you.

52
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,160
You'd be surprised!

53
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,240
She despises me.
Think we might dirty your carpet?

54
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,760
Family meals must be a laugh!

55
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,600
She doesn't come to them.
She thinks I smell of fish!

56
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,520
Look at them! The king and queen
are at the balcony!

57
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,240
They might throw us some coins!

58
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,320
Sailor

59
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,680
Her skin is soft, take her with you

60
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,320
Make her relive
her childhood memories

61
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,240
What's Vincent up to?
He should be here already.

62
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,200
You look lost without him,
the providential man.

63
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,920
- Without him, no marina.
- Without his money, you mean.

64
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,040
Blood red suits you.
You'd think it was invented for you.

65
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,360
Hello, Vincent. How are you?

66
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,640
Look, I've finished the model.

67
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,040
I've done one too, in 3-D.

68
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,400
Look.

69
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,200
Your sister's boathouse.

70
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,240
Surprise...

71
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,120
The Kersaint-Gilly estate.

72
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,400
The five-star hotel.

73
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,680
The 18-hole golf course

74
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,120
and the lighthouse,
lit from the inside.

75
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,240
Wonderful.

76
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,560
Hello?

77
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,040
What?

78
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,040
Christian de Kersaint-Gilly has died.

79
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,680
What?

80
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,960
No to the marina!
No to the marina!

81
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,240
Am I late, Mum?

82
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,200
- We've been here an hour!
- What can I do?

83
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,960
Punch them?

84
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,520
We're in enough trouble as it is.

85
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,480
Yann, don't!

86
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,680
Are you scared the people
will chop your head off?

87
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,120
Someone's died at Kersaint-Gilly.

88
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,120
- Who is it?
- Christian de Kersaint-Gilly.

89
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,240
Two bullets.

90
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,680
Ingrid.

91
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,240
Ingrid!

92
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,440
Nan, you scared me!

93
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,840
Your grandfather has died.
The police are on their way.

94
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,280
The police? What's going on?

95
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,640
He was murdered,
shot twice with a rifle.

96
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,520
Who did it?

97
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,560
What happened last night
between your grandfather and me...

98
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,280
Don't tell anyone.

99
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,720
- No one.
- OK.

100
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,120
Hello.

101
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,960
Hello.

102
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,560
It happened early this morning.
Could be a hunting accident.

103
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,680
Really?

104
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,680
What have we here?

105
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,160
The mayor, Nadia Quemener.

106
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,720
Some mare!

107
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,400
- Hello.
- Nadia Quemener, the mayor.

108
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,800
Captain Marleau, CID.

109
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,240
Sorry. I get my hands dirty
in my job.

110
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,680
What have you found?

111
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,720
It won't be easy.
There's mud everywhere.

112
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,000
Finding clues amid all the leaves
and bowels...

113
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,800
I know all the local hunters.

114
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,120
Some drink a bit,

115
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,720
but they'll own up if they did it.

116
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,720
That would be helpful.

117
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,560
Otherwise it'll be
premeditated murder.

118
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,280
That's not so good.

119
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,080
Tell me...
Christian de Kersaint-Gilly...

120
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,960
His estate is in the way
of your marina project, isn't it?

121
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,800
What are you trying to say?

122
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,600
Nothing.
I just thought I'd mention it.

123
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,560
I'm looking for his wife,
Joséphine de Kersaint-Gilly.

124
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,400
Do you know where she is?

125
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,600
At home, I guess.

126
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,720
It's big.

127
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,680
I'll start with the south wing,
then the west and east wings.

128
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,800
It's huge!

129
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,840
Hey, ma'am!
I've not found her.

130
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,240
Silly bitch!

131
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,440
Are you OK?

132
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,600
- How do you feel?
- I don't know.

133
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,720
He was an old fool.

134
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,560
You call everyone that.
Even your grandmother.

135
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,400
But there's a difference.

136
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,440
My grandma's a fool
with panache, humour, even cruelty.

137
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,840
My grandpa
was a fool soaked in whisky.

138
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,440
And your dad?

139
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,000
Thank goodness he's often away.

140
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,760
That makes him a bearable fool,
almost likeable.

141
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,240
Have you told him?

142
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,600
Is he coming back?

143
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,120
I guess so.

144
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,000
You look pissed off.

145
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,120
No, I'm fine. It's just that...

146
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,680
I think your dad could have won
the Route du Rhum this year.

147
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,840
Stop living the races vicariously
through him. Just do it!

148
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,840
My mum needs me on the trawler.

149
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,040
She can hire someone else!

150
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,120
And yes, my dad is still at sea.

151
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,760
Jo tried calling him,
but he didn't pick up.

152
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,560
Listen, I'm sorry.
Don't worry, I'm here.

153
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,120
You deserve credit.

154
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,120
My grandma's treated you
like you've got the plague for...

155
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,840
- Ten months.
- Ten months? How awful!

156
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,680
Remind me to dump you pretty soon.

157
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,160
- Really?
- Yes.

158
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,760
Yann.

159
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,440
Joséphine doesn't want to see him.

160
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,320
Jo thinks he's a lout.
But I know what she really means.

161
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,400
What?

162
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,280
She's stuck in the 17th century.

163
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,160
She thinks he's below
the Kersaint-Gillys.

164
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,840
Don't judge your grandma.
You can't understand.

165
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,120
I'd like to kiss my boyfriend
without her calling the police!

166
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,320
She's just lost her husband.

167
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,280
Well I've just lost my grandfather!

168
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,720
That kid's got a temper!
Captain Marleau.

169
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,120
I'd like to see

170
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,120
Joséphine de Kersaint-Gilly.
Are you the baby-sitter?

171
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,320
I am Ferdinand Lebovitz,
Joséphine's doctor.

172
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,120
That's what I thought.
You're some kind of baby-sitter.

173
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,320
Can you show me the way?
Thanks.

174
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,720
Hello.

175
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,000
Wow! That's some place!

176
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,360
Don't let appearances fool you.

177
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Thank you.

178
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,000
Impressive.

179
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,720
Don't judge her
on appearances, either.

180
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,040
Oh?

181
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,640
- Are you coming?
- Yes. Nice rifles...

182
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,040
There are four.

183
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,840
Yes, come in.

184
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,560
Ferdinand...

185
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,760
Hello.

186
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,800
Marleau, CID.

187
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,080
Kersaint-Gilly... widow.

188
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,160
My condolences.

189
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,160
Joséphine, you've been smoking again.
I can smell it.

190
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,720
No, you can smell the wood.

191
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,640
I hope you won't lie that brazenly

192
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,320
when I question you.

193
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,520
But you won't question me
with as much frankness.

194
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,200
Right. Question number 1,
a standard one:

195
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,720
Did your husband have any enemies?

196
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,160
- Did he have...?
- Enemies.

197
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,840
Yes.

198
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,760
People loved to hate him.

199
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,440
Enough for him
to take a stray bullet?

200
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,880
I don't know.
I don't know...

201
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,840
We led separate lives.

202
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,560
He did his own thing.

203
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,880
Women? Men?

204
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,520
No, cards.
Women too, I think.

205
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,920
And alcohol.

206
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,200
Anyway, he...

207
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,440
He'd have thought this death
was quite stylish.

208
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,360
Sure. To die alone
in the woods at night

209
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,280
with a bullet in your chest
is very stylish, very classy.

210
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,800
What's that on your neck?

211
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,160
Are you hurt?

212
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,760
No. I was scraped
by a branch in the woods.

213
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,600
Looks like it was
a 5-fingered branch.

214
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,280
5.30. It's time for my series.

215
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,440
I can't miss an episode,
I don't know how to download it.

216
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,240
Goodbye, doctor.
Goodbye, ma'am. See you soon.

217
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,080
Is the questioning over?

218
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,720
She's not stupid.

219
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,160
Even though she tries to look it.

220
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,600
What is that on your neck?

221
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,160
Don't ask, Ferdinand.

222
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,440
Has your father been told?

223
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,800
We can't reach him.

224
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,440
Has something happened to him?

225
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,800
We'd have heard. You always do
when something goes wrong.

226
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,880
Yes.

227
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,040
- You OK?
- Yes. You?

228
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,800
Gwen, come and unload the crates.

229
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,800
No. Pretend I wasn't here.

230
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,200
- Please, honey.
- Mum...

231
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I don't want to smell of fish.

232
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,080
No one'll notice,
other than your PC.

233
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,680
I don't want to revise
while stinking of the sea.

234
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,600
Don't be such a sissy.

235
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,000
You can shower later.

236
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,120
It's such fun to hobnob
with the common people

237
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,480
when you have a handle
to your name!

238
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,160
Your sister bites!

239
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,480
Drop it.

240
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,200
- How's the fishing?
- It's not great these days.

241
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,320
Still, it pays the rent.

242
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,360
I've even bought a caravan.

243
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,760
Not everyone's as lucky as me.

244
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,720
No.

245
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,640
Is your grandma bearing up?

246
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,480
She's not one to talk much.

247
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,440
As straight and pale
as an Easter candle!

248
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,120
When is she going to join in
a demonstration against the marina?

249
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,200
My grandma at a demonstration?
Are you joking?

250
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,760
Is she for it?

251
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,800
She just doesn't care.

252
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,760
When the Quemeners
and their corrupt property developer

253
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,200
come to buy her land,
what will she say?

254
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,640
She'll chase them out with a rifle.

255
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,280
Maybe we should slow things down.

256
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,040
Leave people time
to grieve for Christian.

257
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,200
- What's it got to do with us?
- Are you serious?

258
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,720
They're burying him today.
The solicitor will summon his wife.

259
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,200
Everyone will be watching us.

260
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,080
Who do you think they'll suspect?

261
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,400
His wife.

262
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,360
You're wrong.

263
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,760
Yesterday, the new cop,
the strange pale woman,

264
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,880
was waiting for me
outside my house.

265
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,520
- Did she ask you about Christian?
- No, actually.

266
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,080
No, she just ate her sandwich
and watched me leave.

267
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,760
- Did she speak to you?
- That's the thing.

268
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,040
She just stood there chewing.

269
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,120
I went over to see her.

270
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,880
Did you want to see me?

271
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,120
Who, me? No.

272
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,840
What are you doing here?

273
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,520
I'm eating my sandwich.

274
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,280
- Is that all?
- That's all.

275
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,680
I left and she stayed there
watching the car.

276
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,320
She might be a car enthusiast.

277
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,280
She's a cop.

278
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,600
If she was smart,
she'd be in a different job.

279
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,320
Your swimming pool,

280
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,840
your casino, your golf course,

281
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,840
your 5-star hotel...

282
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,640
your town on the water,
your glass lighthouse...

283
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,120
It would be a shame not to build it

284
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,480
because a bankrupt aristocrat
took a stray bullet.

285
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,480
Talking of which, Vincent...

286
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,680
Was it really a stray bullet?

287
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,520
- You don't think...
- Sorry, but...

288
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,680
You always insist on remaining
in the background.

289
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,760
What do you want me to do?
Show off my cash?

290
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,960
You'd need three lifetimes
to spend it all!

291
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,680
By the way, where does
all that money come from?

292
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,680
I made a pact with the devil.

293
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,160
No. Seriously, Vincent.

294
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,080
If it's not a matter of ego
or money,

295
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,080
what makes you tick?

296
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,120
That Marleau is a pain.

297
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,600
She's just called me in
to ask me

298
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,840
my nail varnish's
reference number.

299
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,560
I'm joking, but only just.

300
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,600
They're all over the place.
Now's the time to strike.

301
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,360
What do you mean?

302
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,880
Ever heard of shock strategy?

303
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,720
What are you doing?
Have you gone mad?

304
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,200
You get people in a state of shock
and you use their distress

305
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,520
to gain the upper hand.

306
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,480
You reassure them
and they're putty in your hands.

307
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,520
So what do we actually do?

308
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,480
Christian's time among us
has come to an end.

309
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,920
Lord, grant that he may
rest for ever

310
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,960
in peace by Your side.

311
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,080
In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit.

312
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,320
Hello. Do you want a handkerchief?

313
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,960
I don't have a cold, miss.

314
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,200
Your granddaughter doesn't look
very Catholic, like you.

315
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,120
I'm protestant
and she's a bit of a protester.

316
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,880
And where's your son?

317
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,640
- He's at sea.
- Ah... I don't like the sea.

318
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,760
Ah, the doctor. Hello.

319
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,200
Has he taken care of the nasty wound

320
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,760
you had on your neck?

321
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,240
What caused it?

322
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,200
A branch.
Nobody's touched it.

323
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:45,560
That's right. The 5-fingered branch.
That's funny.

324
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,480
The killer could actually
be at the funeral.

325
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,040
He must be tall,
judging by the firing angle.

326
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,280
Or average height, I don't know.

327
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,880
He's a nice kid.
I like him.

328
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,760
Why did you say
you couldn't stand him?

329
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,120
I said no such thing.

330
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,480
Oh...

331
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,600
The mayor and her husband.
They're a right pair!

332
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,680
- Friends of the family?
- No.

333
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,240
And who's the new chap?
I don't know him.

334
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,040
Vincent Salmon,
a property developer.

335
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,560
The marina was his idea.
He's very discreet.

336
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,680
What did your husband think
about them wanting your land?

337
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,240
He must have approved,
since he sold them some of it.

338
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,120
- It must have pissed you off.
- Yes.

339
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,720
- Post mortem.
- Post mortem...

340
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,320
Goodbye, doctor.

341
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,360
Ferdinand.

342
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,400
Sorry.

343
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,280
Ma'am...

344
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,040
My deepest sympathy.

345
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,400
Your husband was a dear friend.

346
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,440
My husband was surrounded
by bastards.

347
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,040
I forgot to ask you something.

348
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,760
The night your husband died,
where were you?

349
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,360
- I was asleep.
- That makes sense.

350
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,440
Didn't the shots wake you up?

351
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,840
I'm a deep sleeper.

352
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,920
I sleep with one eye open.

353
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,400
- Luckily, it's not a glass one.
- Yes.

354
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,280
Who was that woman at the funeral?

355
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,640
A cop.

356
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,040
A poor old cop.

357
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,680
If ever I die, don't bury me.

358
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,440
It drags on and on
and you get mud everywhere.

359
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,200
I wouldn't wish it on anyone.

360
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,560
You'd rather be cremated?

361
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,400
And have my ashes scattered
like Scarlett O'Hara's.

362
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,440
She wasn't cremated.

363
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,560
I'm thinking wide-open spaces.

364
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,320
What if you stink of fish
for eternity?

365
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,160
- Eternity has no smell.
- Whatever.

366
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,560
Do you think it was
a stray bullet?

367
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,880
Well he was no saint, but still...

368
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,840
I liked him.

369
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,240
You love anything that has to do
with Kersaint-Gilly.

370
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,200
You should hear yourself!
"Not too tired, Jo?"

371
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,200
"Can I hold your umbrella?"
"You're so elegant!"

372
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,760
Well, she is elegant.
And Christian was classy, too.

373
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,280
If you'd seen him reeling after
a poker game you wouldn't say that.

374
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,400
He played poker?

375
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,560
He frittered away his fortune.

376
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,000
He was addicted and always lost.

377
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,320
- How do you know?
- Eh? I forget.

378
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,880
- By hearsay.
- You've played with him?

379
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,320
- A couple of times.
- Honestly!

380
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,880
- You wasted our money!
- It's Mum's money.

381
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,720
- How dare you judge her?
- I'm not like him.

382
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,160
I win.

383
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,600
How come I'm not a criminal

384
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,760
with role models like you?
- It's not as if...

385
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,280
As if you'd ever smoked dope?

386
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,280
Only once. I was very stressed.

387
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,960
Sorry.

388
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,680
No.

389
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,680
- Does she have a boyfriend?
- I wish!

390
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,960
That's Etienne.
He calls every other day.

391
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,440
She never mentions it.

392
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,880
I don't know what they're up to.

393
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,440
- Do you want one?
- No, thanks.

394
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,520
I'm sorry.
I was dealing with another case.

395
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,120
Are you all right?

396
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,800
Have you seen this? Look.

397
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,720
I've just bought it.
It's an 1887 Chicago.

398
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,520
Watch it glow!

399
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,800
We've known each other a long time,
so I won't beat about the bush.

400
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,480
You inherit the castle
and its grounds,

401
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,920
but also the 140,000-euro debt.

402
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,320
I can't afford that.

403
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,880
Part of it is paid off.

404
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,560
Your husband has sold
part of the land.

405
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,400
Here's the bill of sale.

406
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,800
"In accordance with a deed, etc.

407
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,720
"Mr Christian de Kersaint-Gilly...
to Mr Etienne Quemener."

408
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,440
To Etienne Quemener?

409
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,400
What did he sell?

410
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,600
The clearing.

411
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,120
That can't be right.

412
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,880
He can't have sold the clearing.

413
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,360
Our granddaughter lives there.

414
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,800
All the properties are in his name.
The deed is legal.

415
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:26,360
The sale doesn't cover
the whole debt.

416
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:30,240
You still owe 80,000 euros.

417
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,240
My sincere condolences.

418
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,640
He was like this.

419
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,480
Bastard!

420
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,360
What are you doing on my land?

421
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:17,440
- Poaching? Setting traps?
- Outlining the lighthouse location.

422
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,080
- What?
- The lighthouse. Don't you know?

423
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,920
Quemener are building
a glass lighthouse.

424
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,080
It'll symbolize the marina.

425
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,080
You're on my grandma's land.

426
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,680
It's my boss's plot.

427
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,400
That's impossible.

428
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,200
Go and ask your grandma.
Now let me work.

429
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,960
A lighthouse?

430
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:02,400
You didn't know?
It's Etienne Quemener's crazy plan.

431
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,000
But why on our land?

432
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,800
That was your grandfather's
crazy decision.

433
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,760
Did he sell the castle?

434
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,080
Not the castle,
but the clearing.

435
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,640
That's where I live!
What are you going to do?

436
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,800
What can I do?

437
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,320
I'm drinking my tea.

438
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,560
That's all.

439
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,840
We must get the clearing back
and prevent them from building.

440
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,560
We can't.

441
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,480
They've signed.

442
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,600
Dad wouldn't let them do it.

443
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,400
But your dad's never been around.

444
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,960
You drink your tea.
I'm going to stop them fleecing us.

445
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,560
Do you want to do something useful?

446
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,720
Of course.

447
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,560
Pass your exams!

448
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,280
- OK, Arthur?
- Fine.

449
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,680
I've got red mullet today.
Listen...

450
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,440
Poach it with a shallot,

451
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,640
drizzle it with melted butter:
your wife will swoon.

452
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,920
Good. I'm not in her good books
at the moment.

453
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,440
- I'll have three.
- It's a deal.

454
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,680
Maurice, how would you like
to impress your mother-in-law?

455
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,640
Hello. Sorry...
Carry on, I don't want to interrupt.

456
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,720
Never. To what do I owe
the honour of your visit?

457
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,400
Don't be sarcastic.

458
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,160
I'd like to offer you
an interesting deal.

459
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:44,680
Maybe we could discuss it elsewhere.

460
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,880
- Richard, take over for a minute.
- It'll take longer than that!

461
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:50,840
Come on.

462
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,040
What's it got to do with Gwen?

463
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,040
Your daughter
is more sensible than you.

464
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,760
I don't want to sell my boathouse.
Where would I keep my trawler?

465
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,440
You would sell us your trawler too

466
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,960
and take shares
in the company with me.

467
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,960
"Quemener Brother and Sister"!

468
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,800
What's the plan?

469
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,240
I have it here, look.

470
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,560
Instead of your boathouse,
there'll be a spa

471
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,640
with an infinity pool and the like,

472
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,440
opposite the casino.

473
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,280
You can see it better here.

474
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,480
Look.

475
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,560
Who'll go to your casino
and your spa?

476
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,520
People here can't afford that.

477
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,800
It's going to attract
a more luxury clientele.

478
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,360
You'll be able to ditch the fish.

479
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,160
Who said I wanted to?

480
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Don't you want to earn 5,000 euros
a month without lifting a finger?

481
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,480
To take some time for yourself?

482
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,480
I take time.

483
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,280
Before going home, I go for a walk
and look at the sea.

484
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,720
The sea is beautiful, and it's free.

485
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:13,760
Yeah. But don't you want to buy
your children apartments for later?

486
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,880
Do you think your son's
going to do that all his life?

487
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,280
If he likes it...

488
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,320
What if he was to end up
like his dad,

489
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,480
killed at sea?

490
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:29,320
- Have you ever thought of that?
- All the time.

491
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,520
When he goes out,
I worry he won't come back.

492
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,000
How will you afford your daughter's
studies to be an architect?

493
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,040
She'll do what I did,
she'll get a job.

494
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,800
That's why you never studied
and you can't make ends meet.

495
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,200
Stop thinking about yourself.

496
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,160
Think of your children. Don't let
this opportunity pass you by.

497
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,760
I mean it.

498
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,800
I was just talking to the kid

499
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,480
who's working there.

500
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,800
He's cute.

501
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,520
He told me your grandfather
had sold up.

502
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,880
Your grandma can't have known,
or she'd have been mad.

503
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,640
Of course. Wouldn't you?

504
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,920
My grandparents lived in a caravan.

505
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:21,400
My grandma used to say: "Only the fox
has silver to his name."

506
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,880
Whereas your grandma
wouldn't be pleased about it.

507
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,600
Jo doesn't let herself
be messed about.

508
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,520
Fair enough.

509
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,920
I wouldn't let my husband
sell my clearing.

510
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:37,160
I don't have a clearing or a husband.
But Joséphine is right to fight it.

511
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,520
Have you seen the marks
on her neck?

512
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,400
All for a clearing!

513
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,680
It wasn't just about the clearing.

514
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:48,200
Really? I thought it was
because of the clearing.

515
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:51,600
The bank had called her
and demanded 8,000 euros.

516
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,240
Joséphine told me.
She said to your grandfather:

517
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,520
"You're gambling away
your granddaughter's inheritance!"

518
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,800
He lost it and grabbed her throat

519
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,400
and said: "Shut up, woman!"

520
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,520
Not only that.
He shrieked so much I was scared.

521
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,520
I went out, he left,
and I never saw him again.

522
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,240
The next day he was dead.

523
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,120
See?

524
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,800
Your granddaughter
talks more than you do.

525
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,520
What did you say?

526
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,200
You didn't know?

527
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,440
- You tricked me?
- I didn't trick anyone.

528
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,720
People trick themselves.

529
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,080
Don't they?

530
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,600
Goodbye, ma'am.

531
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,680
- What did you say?
- I'm sorry.

532
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,800
Hey! You're a nutcase!

533
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,680
You're...

534
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,600
Do you enjoy scaring me
or what?

535
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,680
Creeping up on me like a cat.

536
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,320
Shock technique.
Remember?

537
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,640
Sideration. Now you'll be willing
to offer me a drink.

538
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,680
So, your sister?

539
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,160
She decided
she needed time to think.

540
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,040
Typical.

541
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,920
Anything to save face.

542
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,080
She has to sell.

543
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,960
As long as her boathouse is standing,
there's no project.

544
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,680
Don't exaggerate.

545
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,080
We don't need the infinity pool.

546
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,600
People will pay for the view.

547
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,520
Without that view, no marina.

548
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,960
That's the opposite
of what my sister says.

549
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,680
My sister says:
"You can't buy the sea."

550
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,360
She's naïve.

551
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,480
In Greece, tour operators
have accomplished a miracle:

552
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,800
they sell the sunset.

553
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,240
People could watch it anywhere.

554
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,680
But some guys in an office
had a brainwave:

555
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,960
they convinced tourists to pay
to watch it together in one place.

556
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:51,920
Genius!

557
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,400
That's a first-class con.

558
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,800
They're not forcing anyone.

559
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,640
My sister says the marina
will drive prices up,

560
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,240
and that the fishermen
will have to leave.

561
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,120
So she's not naïve.

562
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,120
But I think I hit a nerve:

563
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,800
her children.

564
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,840
Gwen, come here!

565
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,360
Gwen!

566
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,680
Come and do some housework.

567
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,760
Or is it too tiring?

568
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,960
Jerk!

569
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,960
That's enough!

570
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,680
Take a break.

571
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,960
We need to talk seriously.

572
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,960
Your uncle came to ask me to sell him

573
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,960
the boathouse and the trawler.

574
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,960
For the marina?
Never!

575
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,120
Wait, keep a cool head.

576
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,400
It's a generous offer.
Enough to start you off in life.

577
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:59,240
What about Richard?
He won't get another job at his age.

578
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,240
I know.

579
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:03,640
But your sister could concentrate
on her studies

580
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,760
without needing to get a job.

581
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:10,040
Tell her you'd rather work
than put a man out of work!

582
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,400
His wife's in a wheelchair.
His salary is hardly enough as it is.

583
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,680
I'm for the marina.

584
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,760
What? Are you having a laugh?

585
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,840
The world is changing.

586
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,240
We're not going to fish cod
forever!

587
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:28,800
You want to sail around the world,
and now's your chance.

588
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,240
So I sail to the Caribbean
and leave Richard to croak?

589
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:35,840
But Uncle's project
will create dozens of jobs!

590
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,680
Have you seen it?

591
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:41,920
It'll turn the village
into a fortress for millionaires.

592
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:45,040
Do you want to watch them
eating lobster

593
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:48,120
while we won't be able
to afford hake?

594
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,560
I'll be dining with them, jerk!

595
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,960
Who's the guy planting stakes?

596
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,560
One of your uncle's employees.

597
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,680
- Would you like a coffee?
- A small one, please.

598
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:44,120
My grandfather sold them this plot
to build a glass lighthouse.

599
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,560
But what about you?

600
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,200
I'm staying here
and I'm going to resist.

601
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,960
What if they throw you out?

602
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,280
I'll go on a hunger strike.

603
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,280
They'll never finish building it.

604
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,240
I'll do what Penelope did:

605
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,720
every night, I'll destroy their work.

606
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,920
Have you spoken to him?

607
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,080
He's cute, right?

608
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,000
- It's a joke.
- It's not funny.

609
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,680
What's up?

610
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,840
I'm really cross with my sister.

611
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,120
What has she done?

612
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,720
She wants Mum to sell
the trawler and the boathouse.

613
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,920
- I know.
- How? Did she tell you?

614
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,160
Not exactly.

615
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,120
She thinks the project may be good
for the town's economy.

616
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:32,000
Your sister's got great vision.
She's smart.

617
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,680
I know that.

618
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,240
My famous gifted sister...

619
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,680
Next to her, I'm considered
to be the family dunce.

620
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,800
But I love losers.

621
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:03,440
I'd told you not to
set foot here again!

622
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,560
I'll always be here
when Ingrid needs me.

623
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,680
- Leave her to revise!
- I've never stopped her.

624
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,680
You're a bad influence on her.

625
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:14,120
Now she wants to stop studying

626
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,520
and become a foreman!

627
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,880
You know very well
that she makes up her own mind.

628
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,800
Let me do what I'm good at,

629
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,560
which is dry her tears.

630
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,960
You should follow my example.

631
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,640
Go home now. Go on!

632
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,840
What are you doing here?

633
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:39,040
Hello?

634
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,280
Hello. I'd like to speak
to professor Ferdinand Lebovitz.

635
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,520
Yes. This is Jo.

636
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,400
Yes, he knows me.

637
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:55,440
Doctor, Joséphine de Kersaint-Gilly
is on the line.

638
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:04,840
Joséphine?

639
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,600
Ferdinand, I saw them.

640
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,040
They were kissing.

641
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,600
We need to separate them urgently.

642
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:14,720
After her baccalauréat,
send her to study in the UK.

643
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,240
She'll forget him.

644
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,960
She no longer wants
to sit her exams.

645
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,960
She won't want to leave either.

646
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:24,000
She's stubborn and...
No.

647
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,280
Then there's only one solution.
Tell them the truth.

648
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,840
No, never.

649
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:35,720
I've come to make you an offer,
a very generous one.

650
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:38,440
- For whom?
- The two of us.

651
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:44,160
It's simple: you need money
and I'd like to buy you out.

652
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:48,480
You've already got the clearing.
You can watch me from the lighthouse.

653
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,600
Don't try to be smart with me.
I know you're broke.

654
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,840
Excuse me, I have to pour myself
a whisky.

655
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,440
And I only share it with friends.

656
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,440
One million.

657
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,320
For the castle and the woods.

658
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:07,320
No one will offer you a better price
for this ruin.

659
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,720
Go.

660
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:11,880
Goodbye.

661
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,320
You can turn me down once or twice
to save your honour,

662
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,200
but you'll end up selling me
your castle.

663
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,000
I'm not for sale,
and neither is my land.

664
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:58,120
You've been very quiet recently.

665
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,120
The boss is getting worried.

666
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,280
The project is coming along well.

667
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,640
- Just a couple of details to settle.
- What details?

668
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:11,720
I've bought one plot at the castle,
and the old fool has to sign now.

669
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,720
Thanks to us,
she's piled up huge debts.

670
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:18,000
You mean she still hasn't signed?

671
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,360
It's a matter of days, honestly.

672
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,200
Cécile's more of a problem.
She's tough.

673
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:28,160
Wait.
So let me get this straight...

674
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:33,560
You've made no progress at all.
Right?

675
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,360
You do know the boss
needs this marina?

676
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,280
Eh?

677
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,720
You do know
we need to launder this money?

678
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,040
We've had enough of your excuses!

679
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,720
We're stepping it up. Today.

680
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,200
I understand.

681
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,760
- Hi!
- Hi.

682
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,160
- I've brought croissants.
- What's the occasion?

683
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,520
Tarek won't be laying
his concrete today.

684
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,480
- What have you done?
- I took his tools.

685
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:38,800
Your grandma'll be proud.

686
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:42,440
No. She's letting them do it.
It's as if she was stunned.

687
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,640
I want to move it up a gear.

688
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,040
What does that mean?

689
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,880
We can't just watch them
concrete over the coast.

690
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:52,320
I suggest we start
actively bugging them.

691
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,880
Oh, yeah? How?

692
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,600
We take their tools,
we ruin their work,

693
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,480
we put chewing gum
in their car locks,

694
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,640
we siphon their tanks...
- Yes...

695
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:02,880
- Yes!
- You're on!

696
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,040
Yes, we're on!

697
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,880
- You too?
- I'm too old for all that.

698
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,320
I'll resist differently.

699
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,040
I'll sign so the police release you.

700
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,600
Thanks.
You're very quiet, Gwen.

701
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:17,200
You just mess around.
I've got exams in four months.

702
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,880
A coffee? Come on.

703
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:27,360
Enough kissing, now.
We said coffee.

704
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,240
You again.

705
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,320
Hello, ma'am.

706
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,360
I have a question for you.

707
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:38,160
You said you were asleep
when your husband died.

708
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:39,760
But where was he?

709
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,480
He was sleeping, I guess.

710
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,600
I often sleep in my office.
He sleeps upstairs.

711
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:48,000
An upstairs room?
That's not good because...

712
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,880
The coroner says your husband
died around 5am.

713
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:54,800
He was going that way,
so he must have set off from here.

714
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,320
Yes.

715
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,240
Maybe he was going hunting.

716
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,160
That's not a bad idea.
Hunting...

717
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,640
Hunters get up
at the crack of dawn.

718
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,200
He didn't have a rifle.

719
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:08,600
You're Diana the Huntress,
aren't you?

720
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:12,800
What are you getting at?
Do you think I killed him?

721
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,440
I'm not accusing you
of having killed him!

722
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:18,320
Who mentioned murder?
Nobody. Not yet.

723
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,880
I'm talking about his shoes,
covered in mud.

724
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:26,040
I walked from your house
to where he was found.

725
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,160
It's about 100 metres.

726
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,520
My shoes didn't get as muddy as his.

727
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,040
I see.

728
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,040
What else do you want to say?

729
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,600
Not much.
I'm just saying

730
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:40,320
that as his shoes
were much muddier than mine,

731
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,320
he walked more than 100m.

732
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,440
He'd come from I-don't-know-where,
he knocked on your door...

733
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,160
He didn't have any keys.

734
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:51,320
So either you were there
and didn't open the door,

735
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,080
or you weren't there.

736
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,720
I was behind a bush
and I waited for him with a rifle.

737
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:00,880
- Is that what you think?
- I don't think, I'm a cop.

738
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:05,120
I look and listen, that's all.
I'm just a state employee.

739
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:08,040
What?
I'm telling you he came here.

740
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,720
- I counted. 1, 2, 3...
- Enough!

741
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,320
Don't go off in a huff,
Mrs de Kersaint-Gilly.

742
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,880
He was here. 1, 2, 3.

743
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,360
Just about here.

744
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,360
Or else he went to the chapel.

745
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:23,080
He went to...

746
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:27,680
Before the hunt,
he went to pray for game.

747
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,800
She's crazy. Crazy!

748
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,480
What if we ran off?

749
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,160
Just you and me?

750
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,160
What do you mean?

751
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,840
- Now?
- Well, yes.

752
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:40,320
Nobody cares about us here.

753
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,760
Gwen gets all Mum's attention,
your grandma hates me,

754
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,040
and your dad's away.

755
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:48,040
My dad did everything
when Mum died.

756
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,920
He changed my nappies,

757
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,480
fed me my bottle...

758
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,240
He even stopped sailing.

759
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:57,400
That's right. I'd forgotten
your father was a saint.

760
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:00,040
Do you know many men
who stay single for years

761
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:03,800
after their wife died
and they're left with a baby?

762
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:06,040
My dad was devoted to me.

763
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:10,960
He knew what ice cream I liked,
how hot I wanted my hot chocolate,

764
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:14,840
he plaited my hair,
kissed me better when I fell...

765
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:17,160
So yes, my dad's a saint.

766
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:21,080
I just need a change of scene.
It's stifling around here.

767
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,480
- Where would we go?
- Anywhere!

768
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,400
New Zealand, Australia...

769
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,320
Singapore...

770
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:32,080
- What do we have to lose?
- What do we have to gain?

771
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:35,280
We'd be free to love each other.

772
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,120
Wouldn't that be great?

773
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,880
But I love you here, too.

774
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,600
Forget it.

775
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:46,120
I get it.
You don't want to leave with me.

776
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:49,520
My dad took me with him on his boat
until last year.

777
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,040
We sailed round the world
for 4 years.

778
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,920
4 years without school,
without friends,

779
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:57,160
without lessons,
without a timetable.

780
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,760
And I get seasick!

781
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:05,480
Now I just want to stay here,
with my feet in the mud.

782
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:54,680
Come in.

783
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,560
Nadia.

784
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,880
It's nice to see you.

785
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,680
How long since you came to see me?
Six months?

786
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,200
Seven?

787
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,640
You've missed me? Really?

788
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:18,080
Oops! How about a beer?

789
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:20,040
At 10 in the morning?

790
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:23,200
Only kidding, Nadia.
I'll have a coffee.

791
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:24,880
Strong, three sugars.

792
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:32,880
Yvonne,

793
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:35,520
an espresso, no sugar,
and a strong one,

794
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,560
2 sugars, for my sister-in-law.

795
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:39,200
3 sugars.

796
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,680
Given it some thought?

797
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:42,760
Yes.

798
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,120
I won't keep you guessing.

799
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,640
- The answer's no.
- Come in.

800
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:53,680
Thank you, Yvonne.

801
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:07,600
You can't do that.
If you refuse, there'll be no marina!

802
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:10,120
That's right, there'll be no marina.

803
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:11,800
What about your children?

804
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,360
How kind of you to ask.

805
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:17,000
They'll be happy to hear from you.

806
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:20,160
- I wasn't elected to waste my time.
- Quite.

807
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:25,120
Nor were you elected
to put the fishermen out of a job.

808
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,760
Is that all?
Get out of here now!

809
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,120
Shit!

810
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:46,000
Shit.

811
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,160
Shit!

812
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:42,960
- Are you moving out?
- Only my furniture.

813
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,480
The bailiff's here.

814
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:48,200
And you agreed?

815
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:51,120
I wasn't asked for my opinion.

816
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,800
Goodbye.

817
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:58,520
I think you should
leave us alone now.

818
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:02,560
I'll make a complaint.
I'll come back with the police!

819
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,320
Hey guys, leave the sofa.

820
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,680
This lady can't sit on the floor.

821
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:10,000
All right.

822
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:17,240
Come in.

823
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:19,640
I'll make some tea.

824
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:22,600
Come in.

825
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:27,920
The privilege of old age.

826
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,800
- Thank you.
- That's all right.

827
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,840
I grew up seeing more bailiffs
than teachers.

828
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:40,480
Over time I developed
an allergy to them.

829
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,800
You're not talkative.

830
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:45,200
No.

831
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:48,080
I like that.

832
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:53,440
You seem to have problems.

833
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:55,640
Yes, and you're one of them.

834
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:59,320
Yes, I know.
Your granddaughter told me.

835
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:01,960
She told you that?

836
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:04,880
Ingrid's frank.

837
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:07,920
I noticed.
What are you going to do?

838
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:12,000
Wait for death,

839
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:14,640
listening to the wind in the trees.

840
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:20,560
No...

841
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:24,800
Just build your lighthouse
and I'll try and save

842
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:29,200
what's left to save here.

843
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,480
- And the bailiffs?
- I don't know!

844
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,440
I preferred it
when you didn't talk.

845
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:42,040
Why is the sofa outside?

846
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,720
You can't just burst in.

847
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,520
Be polite and say hello.

848
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:47,280
And thank the young man

849
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:50,440
who managed to save my sofa
from the bailiffs.

850
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:52,240
What's he doing here?

851
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:56,080
- I'll leave you to it.
- I'm sorry, Tarek.

852
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:00,640
Forgive her, Tarek.

853
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:06,920
Stop sucking up to my grandma.

854
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:09,440
You want to take
the rest of her land?

855
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:11,760
I've not taken anything from her.

856
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,200
I'm just an employee.
What's the problem?

857
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,480
- You like stopping me from working?
- Yes, actually.

858
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:19,480
I can't work without my cement.

859
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:21,400
If it goes on, I'll be fired.

860
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,560
That's your problem.
Good riddance!

861
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,920
- What have I done?
- You work for jerks!

862
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:28,400
- You got better to offer me?
- Get lost!

863
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:32,160
One more Arab out of work
won't change your cushy life!

864
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:08,280
Bye.

865
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,720
- Uncle, what a surprise!
- Hello.

866
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:13,720
- Were you just passing by?
- We need to talk.

867
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,600
Is something wrong?

868
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:18,520
- No, it's all good, don't worry.
- OK.

869
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,120
- Come on.
- Sure.

870
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:24,000
Hello.
Your wife has called 3 times.

871
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,800
- Hello, miss.
- Hello.

872
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:29,480
Look, Gwen. There's my project.

873
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,080
It's nice, isn't it?

874
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:33,400
The marina represents the universe,

875
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:35,440
the union of the four elements:

876
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:37,080
water, earth,

877
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:39,560
air and fire.

878
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:41,840
The lighthouse represents fire.

879
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:44,440
It's made of glass, it's lit up,

880
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:48,160
and it looks down on the marina
like the Tower of Babel on the world.

881
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:49,720
- Cool!
- You like it?

882
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,720
- Yes.
- Take a seat.

883
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:59,080
I've had a chat with your mum.

884
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:00,520
She told me.

885
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:05,280
I hear you're going to study
architecture in Rennes?

886
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:07,480
I'll have to work to pay the rent.

887
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:10,080
That's your mother's choice.

888
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:11,560
She can't afford much.

889
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,640
No.
She doesn't want to help you.

890
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:17,640
I asked her to team up with me
and she laughed at me.

891
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,880
And you're the one who suffers.

892
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:21,840
Don't worry, I'll manage.

893
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:23,600
I do hope so.

894
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,800
Thank you.
Your project is great.

895
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:38,600
Gwen,
I've got a proposal for you.

896
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:44,840
Would you be interested
in doing a training course with us?

897
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:48,800
Think it over.

898
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,320
We'll discuss it again.

899
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,680
I see the bailiffs have been.

900
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:04,240
They took my sofa out.

901
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:08,040
- Why didn't you tell me?
- You're my doctor, not my banker.

902
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,720
What will you do now?

903
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:13,400
I don't know.
It's going to be complicated.

904
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:16,360
Christian left me
an 80,000-euro debt.

905
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:18,080
Captain Marleau told me.

906
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:20,760
Since you know it all,
what do you suggest?

907
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:22,080
Come and sit down.

908
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:28,480
- Do you want to sell up?
- No.

909
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,720
I love this place too much.

910
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:32,960
We're attached to each other.

911
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:37,120
Do you remember when Renan
played down there?

912
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:38,840
He'd built a little boat.

913
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:42,680
He would salute
before casting off.

914
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,720
- You remember that?
- Yes.

915
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:47,760
And when he pretended
to be shipwrecked,

916
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:50,600
he'd shout:
"Women and children first!"

917
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:54,800
I miss him.

918
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:10,480
That, that, and that...

919
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:11,920
It's all that.

920
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:14,200
If it gets built, I'll lose my job.

921
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:15,640
I'm 58.

922
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:20,160
Do you think they'll hire me
as a waitress in their 5-star hotel?

923
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:23,120
Could I be a bouncer in the casino?

924
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:26,160
- We have to save the harbour.
- Of course!

925
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:33,560
Calm down, calm down.

926
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:35,520
Quiet, quiet.

927
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:37,520
We'll get organized.
Calm down.

928
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:45,720
- What's up?
- Nothing.

929
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:48,400
- Tell me.
- Leave me alone!

930
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:49,800
The boathouse!

931
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:51,640
Oh, no!

932
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:54,600
We'd better do something!

933
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:01,600
What happened?

934
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:13,880
- Come on.
- Yes.

935
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:18,720
Hello.

936
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:19,920
Nasty fire.

937
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:22,400
Thank goodness the firemen came.

938
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:24,640
Otherwise I'd have lost my trawler.

939
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:27,320
It's quite a coincidence.
It caught fire

940
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:28,840
while we were out.

941
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,720
Do you have many enemies?

942
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:56,280
Why?

943
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:58,680
Fires don't start themselves.

944
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:01,160
It wasn't in the engine?

945
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:02,840
It started underneath.

946
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:04,360
First source of fire.

947
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:07,360
Then a second one here
and a third behind you.

948
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:10,640
Three sources of fire in one night.

949
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:13,480
That's a hell of a coincidence.

950
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:15,440
How's the fishing?

951
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:19,920
Sometimes it's better than others,
but we survive. Why?

952
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:22,560
No reason.

953
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:26,040
I was just thinking...

954
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:28,440
When a business is struggling,

955
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:31,000
it's good
to claim off the insurance.

956
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:36,120
You think I burnt down
my boathouse to hit the jackpot?

957
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:37,400
Are you kidding?

958
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:39,760
I wouldn't dare accuse you.

959
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:42,800
I'm just saying
that it's been known to happen.

960
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:45,760
Well, I wouldn't destroy
my source of income.

961
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:47,360
Nor that of my partners.

962
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:50,240
Don't get angry.
Are you paranoid?

963
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:53,720
Having said that,
people are right to be paranoid.

964
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:58,200
So who do you think
would want to light a barbecue

965
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,680
in your boathouse?
- Salmon and Co.

966
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:04,720
- To build their marina.
- Salmon is linked to the Quemeners.

967
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:06,840
Would your brother
have approved?

968
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:09,720
Before he met Salmon,
I'd have said no,

969
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:11,560
but I'm no longer sure.

970
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:14,600
And what do you think?

971
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:16,240
I think they did it.

972
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:20,320
- How's it going with Gwen?
- Very well.

973
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:23,680
Don't worry, I'll be supervising
your internship.

974
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:42,960
Never.

975
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:44,880
Never.

976
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:46,040
Never.

977
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:49,080
Yes. It's settled.
I'm moving in with Yann.

978
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:52,200
Is it because he's not an aristocrat?

979
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:55,200
Don't try and understand,
just obey me.

980
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:57,600
Obey me and don't see him again.

981
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:59,280
I don't have to obey you.

982
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:04,240
You're underage and your dad's away,
so I'm in charge.

983
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:07,920
In 5 months, I'll be of age
and I'll leave.

984
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,560
You'll do what you want.

985
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:12,760
In the meantime,
pack your bags, we're going.

986
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:19,520
They want to live together.

987
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:23,880
The more you try and separate them,
the closer they'll get.

988
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:27,520
So we should just watch them
move in together, kiss,

989
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:28,600
and have kids?

990
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,920
Calm down, Joséphine.

991
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:33,160
It's a waste of time.
You're single

992
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:36,280
and you don't know
the first thing about love.

993
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:39,760
- I'd better go.
- I've hurt your feelings.

994
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:42,640
No, but I am a bit stunned.

995
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:47,000
That's the best solution.

996
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:48,520
We'll leave.

997
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:51,440
But they'll find each other again.

998
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:53,200
She'll soon be 18,

999
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:54,880
so she'll be off.

1000
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:01,960
- We'll go far away.
- She'll catch a plane,

1001
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:04,360
a boat, a coach, anything.

1002
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:06,440
They'll meet up again.

1003
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:10,840
The only solution
is to tell them the truth.

1004
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:13,160
No. Never.

1005
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:15,440
- Jo, please.
- No.

1006
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:17,280
Never.

1007
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:21,400
Never. Never.

1008
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:24,800
Never.

1009
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:31,640
Yes. But the terms have changed.

1010
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:33,520
300,000 for the lot.

1011
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,040
It's daylight robbery.

1012
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:43,080
Value is not set in stone,
you know that.

1013
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:45,480
Yesterday you threw me out,

1014
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:47,440
today you want to sell.

1015
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:49,040
Things change.

1016
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:55,440
Can you bring us
the sales agreement please?

1017
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:02,640
What are you doing here?

1018
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:03,720
An internship.

1019
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:06,240
Here?

1020
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:07,640
What's it to you?

1021
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:09,880
Well...

1022
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:13,120
Ask your mum
how she kept her house

1023
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:15,920
after your father died.
With her fish?

1024
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:17,400
Don't insult my mum.

1025
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:21,440
Ask her for her balance sheet
and how she managed.

1026
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:23,760
I don't understand a thing.

1027
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:25,640
Give me the papers.

1028
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:56,160
She left her scarf.

1029
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,320
Do you like your job?

1030
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:04,280
Do you hate plants and flowers?

1031
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:07,120
Do you prefer the sound
of the pneumatic drill?

1032
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:09,680
Or do you never think?

1033
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:12,200
Answer me, you bloody idiot!

1034
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:54,760
Did you have an argument?

1035
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:58,640
No. Well, a little.

1036
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:00,800
- Do you know where he is?
- No.

1037
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:03,400
Do you think my brother
confides in me?

1038
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:04,600
I hoped so...

1039
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,680
- You OK, girls?
- Yes.

1040
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:08,880
- What will it be?
- Hot chocolate.

1041
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:09,920
Thanks.

1042
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:12,600
- What did you argue about?
- Nothing.

1043
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:14,280
Answer me.

1044
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,440
I'm a bit confused at the moment.

1045
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,200
My mind's in a mess.

1046
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:21,280
- Do you love him?
- Lots.

1047
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:24,120
That's not what I asked.
Do you love him?

1048
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:26,640
Yes. A lot.

1049
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:30,200
- Did Yann not come?
- No.

1050
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:32,880
I waited for half an hour,
then I had to leave.

1051
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,360
Where can he be?

1052
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:36,640
I don't know. Ask Ingrid.

1053
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:38,920
Gwen says he left because of her.

1054
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:40,640
A broken heart.

1055
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:43,640
At that age you think
you'll never get over it,

1056
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:45,360
and then you do.

1057
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:48,200
Well, sometimes you don't.

1058
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:51,720
What's the problem?

1059
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:53,920
What should I do with the crates?

1060
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:10,480
Where's your brother?
Richard waited for him all morning.

1061
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:16,560
What's wrong?

1062
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:18,920
Joséphine sold her estate
to Salmon.

1063
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:21,320
They're leaving, Mum,
her and Ingrid.

1064
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:23,600
So it's all over for us.

1065
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:24,920
How do you know?

1066
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,360
I brought her the papers to sign.

1067
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:30,600
She implied that she
regularly gives you money.

1068
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:31,880
Is that true?

1069
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:37,480
Yes. When you were one,
she opened a bank account

1070
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:39,560
to pay for your studies.

1071
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:41,880
But why? Why for me?

1072
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:47,080
- It's a long story.
- I have plenty of time.

1073
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:50,640
I'll explain.

1074
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:57,360
When you were born,
I was depressed.

1075
01:15:57,560 --> 01:16:00,960
I was in Ferdinand's clinic.
He treated me.

1076
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:02,560
What's the link?

1077
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:05,360
After your birth, I got worse.

1078
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:08,080
One day, I decided to end it all.

1079
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:10,360
I jumped out of the window.

1080
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,000
Joséphine was there.

1081
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:14,560
Nobody had heard
of postnatal depression.

1082
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:17,040
She thought I might kill myself.

1083
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:18,640
She wanted you to be secure.

1084
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:23,080
But why me and not Yann?

1085
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:24,800
She was your godmother.

1086
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,200
You never told me!

1087
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:30,040
We argued.

1088
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:33,440
It was about Yann, in fact.

1089
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:38,040
She said things to me
that a mother can't hear.

1090
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:41,320
Joséphine took care of me
and you nearly killed yourself.

1091
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:44,320
Any other secrets
that I should know about?

1092
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:08,680
I recognized your footsteps.

1093
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,080
How are you?

1094
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:19,920
Well, I'm still standing.

1095
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:22,160
I came as soon as I heard.

1096
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:24,240
What happened to Dad?

1097
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:30,240
God knows... I don't know.

1098
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:33,240
A hunter must have
mistaken him for a wild boar,

1099
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:37,240
or maybe it was a mistress.

1100
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:40,480
With him, who knows?

1101
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:44,360
Honestly, Mum! He's just died.

1102
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:47,800
Yes. Sit down.

1103
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:09,400
- Nice party.
- I'll go and see those arseholes.

1104
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:11,360
Gwen.

1105
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:14,480
Gwen! How lovely to see you!

1106
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,600
You look radiant.

1107
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,240
Hello, gorgeous.

1108
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,400
- I love your earrings.
- Thanks.

1109
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:25,240
Gwen, thanks for coming.

1110
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:28,080
You sounded stressed.
Is everything OK?

1111
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:30,080
I wanted you to share
our success.

1112
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:33,040
This is Gwen, our new intern.

1113
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:35,960
I'd like us to raise our glasses
to her.

1114
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:40,120
Gwen, thanks for coming,
thank you for your smile.

1115
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:41,920
Thanks for being here.

1116
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:45,520
Could you say a word?

1117
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:50,360
Today, thanks to the sale
of the castle,

1118
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:53,120
we are on our way
to modernizing the coast.

1119
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:57,400
We can bring it into
the 21st century at last!

1120
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:59,480
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

1121
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:10,520
You shouldn't smoke.
It'll damage your perfect skin.

1122
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:12,520
What is it to you?

1123
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:15,320
There.

1124
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:18,960
- Is that how you deal with things?
- You could say that.

1125
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:22,080
What's up? You look sad.

1126
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:25,240
Family issues.
I don't want to talk about it.

1127
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:28,240
They don't want you
to do things your own way?

1128
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:30,200
I don't want to go into it.

1129
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:32,920
Family... a nest of vipers.

1130
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:35,960
Relax, Gwen.

1131
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:37,400
Live your life.

1132
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:57,120
- What time is it?
- 9.

1133
01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:01,360
Already? I'm ashamed.
I never sleep this late.

1134
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:04,760
My mum says the early bird
catches the worm.

1135
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:08,520
She's wrong.
It's the bold bird that gets it.

1136
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:16,560
Coffee?

1137
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:20,360
- Croissant or chocolate bun?
- Croissant.

1138
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:57,640
We've got to talk.

1139
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:12,680
That was uncalled for.

1140
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:14,200
A little gift.

1141
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:23,440
Hey, what are you doing?

1142
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:25,120
Preparing concrete.

1143
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:28,800
Good.
And can you tell me why?

1144
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,240
For the lighthouse.
Don't you live here?

1145
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:33,800
I do, more or less.
And you?

1146
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,560
Me too.
Well not really, no.

1147
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:38,800
I came with the build
and I'll leave with it.

1148
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
The locals
aren't very cooperative.

1149
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:44,120
Do you mean the young girl
who lives there?

1150
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:45,960
Yes, for instance.

1151
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:49,360
- Do you know her?
- A little.

1152
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:52,120
She's my daughter.

1153
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:20,720
You're back!

1154
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:25,680
- Look at me. You've changed.
- You always say that.

1155
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:29,400
Because you're always changing,
getting even prettier.

1156
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:32,240
What have we here?

1157
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,720
- Are you an anarchist now?
- It's against Jo.

1158
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:37,960
What's all this
about a lighthouse?

1159
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:40,360
Grandpa sold the clearing.

1160
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:42,560
And Jo wants us to leave

1161
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:44,800
to take me away from Yann.
- Right.

1162
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:14,560
We're making progress.

1163
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:16,240
Joséphine has sold up.

1164
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,400
And Cécile Prigent?

1165
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:22,520
I set fire to her shed,
but unfortunately

1166
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:26,560
her son turned up
just at the wrong moment.

1167
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:31,680
The boss wonders
whether you're up to the job.

1168
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:33,680
Stop it!

1169
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:38,840
I've been working on this
for months.

1170
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:42,840
- By playing poker?
- I ruined Christian.

1171
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:45,560
His wife sold up thanks to me.

1172
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:48,960
I'll get to Cécile through
her kids, her daughter.

1173
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:52,040
Gwen!

1174
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:12,160
What's happening?
Where's Yann?

1175
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:14,960
It's not Yann, it's Gwen.

1176
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,840
It's going to be all right.

1177
