00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,940
Go on, move it, you!

CAPTAIN MARLEAU

3
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,140
Héloïse!

4
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,500
No, I'm Cécile.

5
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:17,700
Sorry...

6
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,380
Nightmare...

7
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,140
My god. Oh, my god.

8
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,060
-You want a coffee?
-No.

9
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,780
I've got to go,
I've got an important delivery.

10
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,380
It's 5 a.m.

11
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,860
Well, yes.

12
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,780
That's right, I'm late.

13
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,020
-Cool, see you in three months.
-Cécile...

14
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,180
You and I...

15
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,220
It's my fault.

16
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,020
-I shouldn't have.
-Don't say anything.

17
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,900
It's better that way.
I get it.

18
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,180
You got a cigarette?

19
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,620
Need a light?

20
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,700
I'll smoke it later.
Show me your hand.

21
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,220
Oh, my poor man...

22
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,740
I see misfortune.
Misfortune is upon you.

23
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,820
-There's someone roaming.
-What?

24
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,300
-Nearby you.
-Who?

25
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,260
Who? The devil.

26
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,900
-Understand? It's the devil.
-Alright, leave me be.

27
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,420
-You need to go.
-I'm not superstitious.

28
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,540
-You aren't superstitious?
-No!

A MOVIE DIRECTED
BY JOSÉE DAYAN

31
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,140
SAMUEL

32
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,740
MANAGEMENT OFFICE

33
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,660
Hey, it's Samuel. I'm not here,
but you already know that.

34
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,740
Only leave a message
if it's good news.

35
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,300
Samuel, it's me, it's dad.

36
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,580
Call me back please,
it's urgent.

37
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,140
Blanche?

38
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,420
Philippe, what are you doing here?

39
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,700
I'm looking for Samuel, is he here?
Have you seen him?

40
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,860
He was at the warehouse
yesterday, why? What's going on?

41
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,180
Manuella is dead.

42
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,300
-What?
-Yes.

43
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,780
I found her in the office.
She was murdered.

44
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,500
Oh, no...

45
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,220
-What's that got to do with Samuel?
-I'm looking for him.

46
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,220
Where is he?

47
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,220
-I have no idea!
-I need to talk to him.

48
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,380
Philippe...

49
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,180
There were all these papers
strewn around her corpse.

50
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,060
See? Deliveries that had been
carried out.

51
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,220
-Hours, everything.
-So what?

52
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,500
It was Manuella's job
to check all that.

53
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,700
You should've left it as it was.

54
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,140
I panicked, I didn't take it all.

55
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,700
We'll handle everything step by step.

56
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,380
You find Samuel,
and I'll call the police.

57
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,780
-Are you sure?
-Of course.

58
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,620
Why wouldn't I call them?
We have nothing to hide.

59
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,620
-Except if...
-If what?

60
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,460
Philippe...

61
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,220
You can't suspect your son
of having killed her?

62
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,740
No. Honestly, Blanche...

63
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,780
We're so distant,
him and I, that...

64
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,780
You completely lost your mind.

65
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,580
Samuel didn't kill anyone, okay?

66
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,940
And I'm calling the police.

67
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,780
Okay. You're the one who's right.

68
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,300
We'll do like we said.

69
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,380
You know where to find him?

70
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:34,660
I tried to call him,
but it went straight to voicemail.

71
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,620
Don't worry, Philippe.

72
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,300
Everything will be fine.

73
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,500
-Everything will be fine, Philippe.
-Yes.

74
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,500
POLICE

75
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:08,500
I'm a woman, I'm not disabled!

76
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,340
Ladies & gents...

77
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,020
Captain Marleau, homicide.

78
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,300
-Blanche Muir.
-No handshake.

79
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,220
You'll stink of Vaseline.
Know why?

80
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,100
Oiled this morning.

81
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,220
Vaseline is great,
it's handy.

82
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,500
But it stinks.

83
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:25,940
Shall we?

84
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,220
-Hey Gravos, how you doing?
-Hello.

85
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,020
-So, is this yours?
-No, I handle hours and stocks.

86
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,460
The company belongs
to my brother, Philippe.

87
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,820
-What is all this?
-She's totally nuts.

88
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,820
-What's this?
-I don't know.

89
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,740
She was our accountant.

90
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,540
Manuella Morales.

91
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,060
And who found the body?

92
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,180
My brother, this morning.

93
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:12,220
Where's your brother?
I'm going to need his statement.

94
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,100
He had to go on an urgent delivery.
He asked me to tell you.

95
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,460
That so?

96
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,660
And you here, miss?

97
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,940
Did you not see anything?

98
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,380
-No, I saw nothing.
-Oh.

99
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,340
Listen. You're going to tell
your brother over the phone.

100
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:35,540
You're going to tell him, from me:
"As long as we haven't found

101
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:38,540
the guy who did this,
urgent deliveries are over."

102
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,740
-Alright?
-Yes, of course.

103
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,220
Well yeah, duh.

104
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,060
Any news from Samuel?

105
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,660
Philippe, call me back
when you get this.

106
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,780
It's urgent, Captain Marleau
wants a statement from you.

107
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,900
What's this thingy?

108
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,660
-This yours?
-No. Everybody gets coffee here.

109
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,660
Well yeah, but...

110
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:11,660
Hey!

111
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,060
Will you take this to the lab,
please?

112
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,260
Because you never know,
you know?

113
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,940
You never know what could...

114
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,940
Can you call your brother back?

115
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,380
Be a little insistant.
You can just press redial.

116
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,540
It's faster that way, you know?

117
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,260
-He's still on voicemail.
-Oh, yeah?

118
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,540
He's in Spain, he doesn't get service
there. He'll be back around 6 p. m.

119
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,340
Did his voicemail tell you that?
That's crazy.

120
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,460
New technologies,
nano-technologies, all that...

121
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,940
When I call up my brother,
he answers.

122
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,500
If he doesn't answer, I call back.
But people...

123
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,380
saying I'm dead, I'm ill...

124
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,660
COURTROOM

125
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,500
Will you give me file 23?

126
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,420
Well, get the file to me, okay?

127
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,540
I need to talk to you.

128
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,180
JUDGE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE APPLICATION OF SENTENCES

129
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,660
Your company accountant was killed.

130
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,500
I better understand
why you came, now.

131
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:39,540
Don't worry, I'll tell the cops:
"He can't have killed his associate,

132
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,540
"he was making love to me
and dumping me."

133
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,540
I'm sorry, I've got no excuse.
I'm an asshole, that's all.

134
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,380
I'm not resentful,
I'll say we were together.

135
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,140
You're wrong, Cécile.
I didn't come for me.

136
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,540
I don't care
about what the cops might say.

137
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,820
I came about the kid.
I don't know where he is.

138
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:57,940
What, Samuel?

139
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,980
-What's he got to do with all this?
-Nothing, I hope.

140
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,940
You don't know where he is,
do you?

141
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:10,780
Let's sum it up:

142
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,940
You dump me at 5 a.m., and at 8 a.m.,
you come and beg me to find your son.

143
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,980
What makes you think
I'm dumb enough to help you?

144
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,420
You're right, I'm sorry, I...

145
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,380
I'm overwhelmed.
I'm sorry for bothering you.

146
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,700
Come back, Philippe.

147
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,940
You're in luck, you found
the queen of dumbs.

148
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:39,620
Who is this guy, now?
Where does he think he is?

149
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,940
You show up just now?
Who are you, anyway?

150
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,620
Léopold Salaun, coroner.

151
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:46,380
Wait!

152
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,780
Not a word,
I'll read your mind.

153
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,980
"This coroner asshole has no business
on my crime scene."

154
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,220
Well yes, because cold meat,

155
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,940
I prefer to see it
while it's still warm!

156
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,820
If you see what I mean.

157
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,420
In its natural habitat.

158
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,780
Then, hop!
Off we go to the morgue,

159
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,860
chop it up, weigh it,
and wrap it up.

160
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:16,060
Guys, just because I'm talking to
a woman doesn't mean you can dawdle!

161
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,540
I like to titillate those big
Q-tips, too.

162
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,220
They do look like giant Q-tips.

163
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,540
I'm Captain Marleau, homicide,
I was transferred to Perpignan.

164
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,540
Charmed.

165
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,220
She was killed last night,

166
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,260
between five or six in the morning.

167
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,860
I'll tell you exactly
when I've opened her up.

168
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:43,060
-Three hits. The bullets were...
-It's nine millimeter, yeah.

169
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,980
With a silencer. The tip
was touching on the first shot.

170
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,980
So that means she knew
her murderer, then.

171
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,820
Because I would never let
someone come so close.

172
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,980
She defended her life dearly,
she fought to the end.

173
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,780
I got some DNA on her fingernails.

174
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,580
There, see, she took a hit.

175
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,980
-A big slap.
-Oh, yeah.

176
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,500
-That's funny.
-Really?

177
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,580
-You think so?
-Yes, because...

178
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,980
Let's say you're the killer...
You don't look like one,

179
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,420
even if you look a bit like Landru...

180
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:16,100
You want to kill this chick
because you don't like her,

181
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,980
and you're in luck, because you have
a silent, solid gun at home,

182
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,020
that's available in several colors...

183
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:26,100
You going to slap this chick around
before you kill her? No.

184
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,500
What would you do?

185
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,420
I don't know.

186
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,220
I don't deal with feelings.

187
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,980
I just deal with the meat.

188
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,420
Maybe his girl
knows where he is.

189
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,100
You didn't know
he had a one?

190
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,980
Since his mother's death,
him and I have...

191
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,260
-Has it been going on for long?
-6 months.

192
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,820
They met here,
she was leaving my office.

193
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:59,260
And you know him,
he asked her out for a drink.

194
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,100
-And she said yes.
-She's a junkie, too?

195
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,380
She got a one-year suspended sentence
for dealing ecstasy.

196
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,100
Hang on, I must have
her contact info somewhere.

197
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,580
Salomé Delvigne.

198
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:24,100
No address, just where she works:
in a bar in Cauliaux, Villa rouge.

199
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,540
-I don't know how to thank you.
-I'm doing it for Samuel.

200
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,860
I'll go find him, thanks.

201
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,740
It's a night bar.
It doesn't open until 22:00.

202
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,380
See you there at 22:00.
I'm going with you.

203
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,980
After all, taking care of your son
is my job.

204
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,740
Thank you.

205
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,380
Watch her head.

206
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,420
Tell me when, Laurence.

207
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,740
There we go.
As fast as possible, mmh?

208
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,420
You, I want to see you
to interrogate you very soon.

209
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,260
You, not right away.

210
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:14,020
If I got this right,
your job is handling deliveries,

211
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,980
checking all that comes and goes.
And lately, you've noticed nothing

212
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,820
strange?
Any issues?

213
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:24,820
No, the company is doing pretty well.
In this economy, we can't complain.

214
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,860
Got it. Muir...

215
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:30,820
Muir Philippe, Blanche, Samuel...
Really a family business, how nice.

216
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,180
Yeah, but not only.
There's also Pierrot,

217
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,140
he's a heavy truck driver.

218
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,420
Jennifer Lavaux, the secretary,
and there was Manuella.

219
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,420
Ah, yeah, right.

220
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,580
ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES

221
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,300
I remember the day Philippe
introduced me to her.

222
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,420
It was last year.

223
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,980
She showed up in her pink jacket,
she looked all around her,

224
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,260
and she softly said:

225
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:03,300
"Hire me as your accountant,
I'll double your revenue in a year."

226
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,540
"Hire me..."

227
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,020
Well, she did it.

228
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:12,540
She instigated budgetary restrictions
my brother wouldn't imagine.

229
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:16,620
She started inspecting the drivers,
their margins,

230
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,020
their mileage.

231
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,980
She lowered salaries
and increased bonuses.

232
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,540
She ruined the competition.

233
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,300
And our profits margin tripled.

234
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:30,860
Well...

235
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,300
That's a lovely eulogy, really,
it was very moving.

236
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,100
She seems like a lovely character.

237
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:41,540
But I'd like to find Samuel, myself.
Where is that guy?

238
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,260
He's on his way back from a delivery,
he's just been told.

239
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:51,060
That's unfortunate. Meanwhile,
do you mind going to get mister...

240
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,860
-Lacoudre, is that it?
-Pierrot?

241
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,700
-Sure, I'll call him right away.
-I will talk to him.

242
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,580
You're too kind, madam.
Oh, Mrs. Muir!

243
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,300
No, wait, you're Miss Muir, right?

244
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,620
You're not the missus,
you're the sister, is that it?

245
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,980
-It's miss, yes.
-Miss Muir, got it.

246
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:12,340
-You'll be sticking around, right?
-Where do you want me to go?

247
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:15,780
I don't want to be told again
that a member of the Muir family

248
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:19,180
-has vanished into nature.
-Relax.

249
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,540
You're too kind.

250
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,300
Pierrot?

251
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,060
-Alright, go on.
-I'm going.

252
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,860
-Come in, sir.
-Nice to meet you.

253
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,540
-Jennifer, you're next.
-Yes.

254
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,860
Otherwise people leave
and I get in trouble.

255
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:39,740
What's the atmosphere like here?
Prior to this morning, I mean.

256
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,500
-Well-spirited, I imagine.
-Really?

257
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,860
Even after
Mrs. Morales arrived?

258
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,300
Because that chick seemed like
she had some oomph to her, no?

259
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:52,700
Yes, maybe it was better before.
She wanted to control everything.

260
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,740
If you were a minute
behind schedule, you'd catch hell.

261
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,900
-The truckers didn't like that much?
-No.

262
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:05,020
And so, last night,
what happened in particular?

263
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:09,740
-Nothing in particular.
-No? Yes, come on, think about it.

264
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,700
I don't know, a fight,
or maybe...

265
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,740
A dude who was
behaving weirdly?

266
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,020
Or a trucker who was mad because

267
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:20,500
Mrs. Morales was
micro-managing his affairs?

268
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,220
It was the same as usual.

269
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,420
-What's this?
-Excuse me, I need a file.

270
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,700
And Blanche Muir,
what's she to you?

271
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:38,460
-A colleague.
-Sure, she is!

272
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,580
I need to make a photocopy.

273
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,700
I'm not a courtship ritual specialist
but I'm not blind, either.

274
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,420
-There's nothing.
-But you would like...

275
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,420
To smother her in little kisses, no?

276
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,860
That has nothing to do
with Manuella's death.

277
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,020
It does and I'll tell you why, sir.

278
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:04,140
If you love her, then you might not
tell me everything about Blanche.

279
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:08,300
-But she didn't do anything.
-Sure, but her brother, her nephew?

280
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:13,140
I'll only speak in the presence
of a lawyer. I know my rights.

281
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:17,060
You have rights when you're
in custody. Are you? No.

282
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,780
Although, be patient,
it could happen. I'm off.

283
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,620
Miss Muir!

284
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,300
If you see your bro,

285
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,420
if you ever get a hold of him,
tell him I'm expecting him.

286
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,500
At Mrs. Morales' house.

287
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,340
Captain Marleau.

288
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,300
Philippe Muir.

289
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,020
She lived here all alone?

290
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,500
No kids, no fella, no girl?

291
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,700
Can you smell that?

292
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,420
It stinks.

293
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,780
This pad reeks of loneliness.

294
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,780
It reeks of TV dinners
being eaten all alone.

295
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,340
It reeks of sadness.

296
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,740
It reeks of tears we hold back.

297
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,500
The sighs that no one hears.

298
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:11,340
But... Are you sure
she was single?

299
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,940
Because if she was, who was
she getting all dolled up for?

300
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,860
She was pretty.

301
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,020
Your sister told me
you're a widower.

302
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,300
You never thought
of getting married again?

303
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,900
It's funny, because...

304
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,660
you smell like her.

305
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,900
The same scent.

306
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,020
Loneliness smells strong.

307
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,740
It doesn't just go away in the wash.
So I was wondering if...

308
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:50,100
Well, you know, if...

309
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,660
Do you never finish
your sentences?

310
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,020
Were you and Manuella lovers,
Mr. Muir?

311
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,020
No.

312
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,900
Say, we're looking for
Salomé Delvigne.

313
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,700
Over there, maybe.

314
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,620
I hate kids your age.

315
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:59,060
They do stupid shit all the time,
they have fun and don't give a fuck.

316
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,780
We, the old,
we can't do anything else.

317
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,540
Nothing else than wait
and be scared for them.

318
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,620
You know why?

319
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,980
Because we're so fucking stupid
that we can't manage to love you.

320
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,780
Fuck off!

321
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,820
My kid's name is Samuel.

322
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,940
And his girlfriend's name is Salomé.

323
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,780
And she works here,
she's a waitress here.

324
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:28,060
So if one of you knows
where I can find her,

325
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,020
I'll be over there, by the bar.

326
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,780
And I'll be waiting all night.

327
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:37,620
And I will be scared for him.

328
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,580
'Cause I'm a real dumbass.

329
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,860
Come in.

330
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,940
You're making me do overtime.
Here you go.

331
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,780
All the video footage
from the past week.

332
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,140
That's very kind.

333
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,660
You can go now,
I'll figure it out.

334
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,220
-By the way...
-Yes?

335
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:38,380
You didn't like Manuella
at all, did you?

336
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,980
-Oh, yes.
-Yes? No...

337
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:45,140
You're kidding.
Good night.

338
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,180
Alright, goodbye.

339
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,740
That's right...

340
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,180
So...

341
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,820
The Oscar for the best
company film

342
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:59,260
goes to...

343
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:05,500
Muir Transport. Conversations
with people ignoring one another.

344
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,500
I bet I'm going to be bored.

345
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:25,380
-Here, it's empty.
-You sure you want another?

346
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,100
I need courage to tell you
an unpleasant thing.

347
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,900
I'll take one too, then.

348
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,940
Can we get two more, please?

349
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,420
Without too much soda water.

350
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:40,540
No wait, no soda water at all.
Just alcohol.

351
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,460
Thank you.

352
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,660
So?

353
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,980
Do you often sleep with women
and then run off?

354
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,900
No. It's happened to me before,
but not often.

355
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,220
It's my first time sleeping
with a guy who dumps me upon waking.

356
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,180
Am I that bad?

357
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,540
You're an incredible woman.

358
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,780
Admirable.

359
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:05,700
Very pretty.

360
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:08,900
And brilliant.

361
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,260
You are fucking with me.

362
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,980
I spent the day
waiting for your call.

363
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,940
It's been three months since we met
for Samuel's...

364
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:35,740
-You want to talk to me?
-It's about Salomé.

365
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:42,540
She was supposed to come tonight.
She didn't and she's unreachable.

366
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,380
-Since when?
-Last night.

367
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,700
All right.

368
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,500
Oh, shit.

369
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,100
Héloïse!

370
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:56,780
-Where are you coming from?
-Grenoble. An urgent delivery.

371
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,700
In Grenoble?
I didn't mark anything down.

372
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,260
What's going on with you, Pierrot?

373
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:05,780
-What are you doing here so early?
-I wanted to see you.

374
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,860
Pretending to run into me?

375
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:12,220
-Why don't you just come see me?
-You never have time.

376
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,940
Always taking care
of your nephew or brother.

377
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,820
I know you don't like him.

378
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,860
But he's a great guy, I promise.

379
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,540
If you knew him better...

380
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,140
I saved that guy's ass
from the cops.

381
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,140
The morning of the crime,
he was there.

382
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:28,860
I saw him.

383
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:30,940
And I shut it.

384
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,580
Thank you, Pierrot.

385
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:41,300
When all of this is over, we can
get to know each other a little,

386
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,940
you and I, okay?

387
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,300
We'll go out for a nice meal,
just the two of us.

388
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,620
Hello!

389
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,940
You're still here?

390
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,780
Yes, I'm still here
for a good while.

391
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,820
I must have been a rabbit
in another life.

392
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:24,300
Anytime I'm anywhere,
I've got to dig my little hole.

393
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,660
Give me a hand, now,
help me get back up.

394
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:36,420
It's a good thing you're here, 'cause
I'd like to show you something.

395
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,980
On the footage, here,

396
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:43,340
there's a guy,
and I don't know who he is.

397
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,980
Is he a part of the company or not?
Take a look.

398
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,740
That's Samuel, my nephew.

399
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:54,540
Oh, sorry.
Because this guy's in real trouble.

400
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,740
I'm telling you.
Oh that's right, Samuel Muir!

401
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,540
How silly I am.
Just look at this would you.

402
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,180
See what he says?

403
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,660
No?

404
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,940
-I don't know how to read lips.
-Me neither, but look.

405
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:11,780
He grabs her by the shoulders,
then he says something.

406
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,740
"I'm going to kill you."

407
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:18,260
And then, a few hours later,
boom! She's dead.

408
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:21,980
Yes, look. I don't want to act like
some two-bit Columbo,

409
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,540
but that smells like a clue.

410
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,460
And do you have footage
of the murder?

411
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,700
Well, the thing is that...

412
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:34,060
The video files after 5:12 were
all erased. What a coincidence.

413
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,060
Clever beast.

414
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,980
I'm sorry for you, captain.

415
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:44,140
Samuel was over at my place
the night before last, for dinner.

416
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:47,620
Since he had a drink,
I didn't want him on his motorcycle.

417
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,100
He's got his room there anyway.

418
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,420
I live at our parents'.

419
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:57,140
When Philippe left, someone had to
stay to take care of those old walls.

420
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:04,980
-Alright, will you buy me a coffee?
-Yes, down at the end of the hall.

421
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:08,940
I slept bad.

422
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,020
You know what?

423
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,700
It's a good thing
you're close to him.

424
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,860
That way, you can call him

425
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:18,220
so I can find him
and talk to him real quick.

426
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,060
I'm not patient.
Go ahead, right behind you.

427
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:25,620
I'm not patient,
I think I must be bipolar.

428
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:29,580
Because even with like an ATM,
when it says "Please Wait" on it,

429
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,860
it pisses me off!
I want to hit it.

430
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,820
-You want a big or a small one?
-A big one.

431
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,180
With 3 sugars.

432
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,580
Hey, it's Samuel. I'm not here,
but you already know that.

433
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,700
Only leave a message
if it's good news.

434
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:03,580
Samuel, look, it's dad.

435
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,940
I've been looking for you
for two days. Call me back.

436
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,980
-Can I help you?
-I'm exhausted. Can I have a coffee?

437
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,580
Help yourself, it's over there,
I just made it.

438
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,900
You look in a right state, today.

439
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,460
You too.

440
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,540
That's nice of you.
It's because I raged all night

441
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:45,140
with some young kids.
Who were of age, mind you.

442
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,780
And what's your excuse?
Because, as a hardened bachelor,

443
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:53,660
-what do you do at night?
-If you only knew.

444
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,420
I'd rather not.

445
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:59,380
I brought along
your son Samuel's file.

446
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:03,660
It's quite the long-read.
Unlawful acts,

447
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:06,940
blows and injuries,
and crack consumption, too.

448
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,740
It's not that big of a deal.

449
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,660
We aren't asking that much
of him either.

450
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,900
His teenage years were hard.

451
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,900
Come on, that's a load of crap.
Honestly?

452
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,620
I had some shitty
teenage years, too.

453
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:26,380
I lived in a housing project,
and my mom was an alcoholic.

454
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,220
I tore legs off grasshoppers.

455
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,340
But it didn't turn me
into a serial killer.

456
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,460
No, but...

457
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,420
His mother died

458
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:41,420
in a truck accident,
in Spain.

459
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,220
He was 10 years old.

460
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:48,740
I raised him as well as I could.

461
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,620
It apparently wasn't good enough.

462
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,940
Luckily, my sister was there.

463
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,820
I think that without her,

464
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,900
I wouldn't have known what to do.
I was depressed, staying in.

465
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:07,540
You know what depression is?
You don't want to see anyone,

466
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,980
you want to sleep all day.
It lasted for a long time.

467
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:13,540
It takes time.

468
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,420
Your place is nice.

469
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,140
-She's pretty, no?
-Yeah.

470
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,780
When she left us,
I really hit rock bottom.

471
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,580
Samuel spun out of control.

472
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,700
I didn't notice.
He stopped working hard at school.

473
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,940
He started smoking weed.

474
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:58,460
After that, it was cocaine,
and the heroin,

475
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:01,460
and then crack, then klonopin,
then alcohol, then...

476
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:03,580
All that stuff.

477
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,420
And then there were
the downward spirals,

478
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,660
the nervous breakdowns.

479
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:11,660
Hell, in short.

480
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:16,060
I emerged from rock bottom,

481
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,580
and I took him with me to the garage.

482
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:23,860
Because I wanted to help him get
out of it. He'd decided he wanted to.

483
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,260
He was seeing a shrink.

484
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,700
And he was on meds.

485
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:34,180
He figured it out.

486
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,580
That kid really put me
through the wringer.

487
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,460
And I've never seen anyone
as unlucky as him.

488
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:44,540
Every time there was a hard blow,
boom, it was him it hit.

489
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,420
I can tell you that deep down,

490
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,260
he really is a good kid.

491
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,420
Well, a good kid...

492
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,620
That's one way to look at it.
He did threaten to kill a broad,

493
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:58,940
Manuella Morales.
And a few hours later...

494
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:01,660
-She was dead.
-No, I just don't believe that.

495
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,540
I just refuse to believe that.

496
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:07,580
I refuse to believe
he'd do such a thing.

497
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:11,060
You know, I met a guy
who's done some crack once.

498
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:14,500
He was completely stoned.

499
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,900
He was fighting with a machete.

500
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,540
Against some cornstalks, he thought
they were Afghani soldiers.

501
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:23,020
-Nothing surprises me anymore.
-Yes...

502
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,940
Samuel can't do such a thing.

503
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,660
He couldn't have done
such a thing.

504
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:33,540
With the way his mother
brought him up, there's no way.

505
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:42,180
Yet weirdly, I do get the impression
that you think your son is guilty.

506
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,060
Am I wrong?

507
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,340
Your sister told me
you'd be here today.

508
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,700
Sorry to bother you,
but it's important.

509
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,220
I know where Samuel's girlfriend
can be found.

510
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,860
It's not that I don't like you.

511
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,740
It's that I'm bad luck.

512
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,940
It's like a curse.

513
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:42,780
I know it's ridiculous.

514
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,140
I don't believe it myself.

515
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:47,940
But it's true.

516
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,620
All the women I've loved
wind up dying.

517
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:56,380
And if they only slept with you once,
does it count?

518
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:59,100
I'm already fucked,
so I might as well enjoy it.

519
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:06,460
I had my first girlfriend at 18.
We were very serious.

520
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:10,620
I had that girl under my skin.
It was a first for me.

521
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,180
It was true love.

522
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:15,900
Six months later,

523
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:19,340
a car smashed her scooter
to smithereens.

524
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,620
She died on the spot.

525
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:26,820
Then, there was Héloïse.

526
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,180
I met her in Spain.

527
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,180
Love at first sight.

528
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,420
We got married,

529
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:36,900
and we had Samuel.

530
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,060
Then we came back here.

531
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,900
I started working for myself.

532
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:52,500
But Héloïse was homesick, so,
I told myself we could figure it out.

533
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:55,580
We could keep the business going
with my sister here,

534
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:58,980
and that I would go over there.

535
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,900
After all, it wouldn't change much.

536
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:11,820
We got ready for a weekend trip

537
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,900
to go find a house there,
so we could go live there.

538
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:22,340
We were supposed to go together
but I couldn't go with her.

539
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,460
An order came in at the last minute.

540
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:29,180
I had to go to Lille
to do a delivery.

541
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:39,020
She fell asleep behind the wheel,
and she died.

542
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:42,860
Good God.

543
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:51,820
After that, there was Manuella.

544
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:55,700
I knew that things
could happen.

545
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,140
But...

546
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:01,900
I was scared.
And then one day I gave in.

547
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:05,580
I kissed her.

548
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:10,180
You know where she is now.

549
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,780
And then there's you.
There's us.

550
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:22,340
As soon as I saw you, I loved you.

551
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:28,180
I loved you. I don't want anything
whatsoever to happen to you.

552
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:30,620
I'm scared.

553
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:40,780
Are you serious?
You really think you're bad luck?

554
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,140
Where do we find
Samuel's girlfriend, then?

555
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:14,780
CORONER
LÉOPOLD SALAUN

556
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:45,220
What, it's me!

557
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:50,860
You've got some nerve,
bothering me while I'm working.

558
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:52,460
I've killed for less.

559
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:55,620
I know, it would have been the same
for me. I'm sorry.

560
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:58,500
No but, I'm happy to see you.

561
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:01,940
Although I imagine you're here
for her, not just for my enjoyment.

562
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,860
-Oh, doctor.
-Call me Léopold.

563
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:07,340
Oh no, I couldn't.

564
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:11,500
I'm sorry, captain,
but meaning no offense,

565
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:15,700
I've seen better,
as far as corpses go.

566
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:18,180
I've seen some that tell
amazing stories.

567
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:21,180
Stories of passionate love,

568
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:24,180
terrible revenge stories,
couple's secrets...

569
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:27,740
I'll stop you there, I'm sorry,
but I'm going to need your help,

570
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:30,140
because on the Q-tip end,
it's a mess.

571
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:33,660
All they've found are fingerprints
from company employees.

572
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:36,140
Nothing suspicious.
I'll need you, if possible.

573
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:38,180
Your wishes are my command.

574
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:42,780
Manuella Morales died
around 6 a.m.

575
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:48,060
According to her bolus,
she'd had dinner 10 hours prior.

576
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:49,460
It was Sushi night.

577
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:54,060
With raw tuna, avocado, mango,
shrimp, raw salmon...

578
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:57,940
Salmon? With what's
in the oceans, that's gross.

579
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:01,220
Yes, crab, kiwi, lobster...

580
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:03,340
-Makes you hungry?
-Seven euros a pop.

581
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:08,340
Seven euros? Seems like someone
thought she was the bee's knees.

582
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:11,660
Kiwi-crab maki

583
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:14,580
are one of
chef Yannick Ménard specialties.

584
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:17,940
They only sell them
at Rashōmon.

585
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:20,180
-Where?
-Rashōmon!

586
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:25,300
Like the Kurosawa film. I could
take you there one of these nights.

587
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:29,740
Anyway, other than than, I've got
the DNA from under her fingernails.

588
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,780
So, who's DNA is it?

589
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:43,500
Hey there!
I'm not bothering you, am I?

590
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:48,460
I've got an assessment to finish,
Manuella's files. But I can help you.

591
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:49,580
No.

592
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:52,900
I'll figure it out, just keep
working as you see fit.

593
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:55,940
I'll look around by myself,
like a big girl.

594
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:03,620
This is wild.

595
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:06,620
Have you noticed? Your nephew

596
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:09,340
eats up more diesel
than the other truckers do.

597
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:11,500
A third more.
Does he go far?

598
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:12,940
I don't know.

599
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:17,780
Well, it's easy, look. The journeys
are written down right here.

600
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:22,780
Last week, for instance,
he went to Spain.

601
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:24,620
From Collioure to Cadaquès

602
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:28,060
to get 7 tons of primer,
like his dad the night before.

603
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:30,780
Except that the dad used up
17 euros worth,

604
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:33,380
whereas he used up
28 euros worth.

605
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:36,380
You know how to count, no?
It means he went twice as far.

606
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:39,020
No? So where'd he go?

607
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:41,500
-You don't know?
-No.

608
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:44,380
I'll show you how.
You take a pair of compasses...

609
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:49,660
This is 28 euros worth of distance.
You take a map, and look.

610
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:54,100
It means that he went all the way...

611
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:56,500
-Barcelona.
-So what, what does that prove?

612
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:00,500
Well, I don't know, miss, it shows
that an enterprising kid like that

613
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:02,380
can use the company's trucks

614
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:06,340
to go see other customers and provide
them with different merchandise,

615
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:09,500
especially a kid
who is a notorious crack consumer!

616
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:12,460
Samuel has kicked the habit.
You know that very well.

617
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:13,620
This is fiction.

618
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:16,780
Maybe for now, but I bet
that if we go into his truck,

619
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:18,380
it will become a reality.

620
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,820
What does this have to do
with Manuella's death?

621
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:28,620
It's simple, Manuella went
ferreting about all over the place.

622
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:32,340
Look, she's highlighted things, here.
She found the same issues as I did.

623
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:35,820
Which proves that curiosity
can kill the cat.

624
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:40,540
Samuel can't have killed Manuella.

625
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:42,460
-There's no way!
-There's no way?

626
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:45,780
Well then why did you get him
a totally bogus alibi?

627
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:49,180
He's been gone for two days,
since Morales' death!

628
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:54,940
Family love is nice, it's lovely.
But it has its limits!

629
00:49:57,940 --> 00:49:59,500
Oh yes, I forgot to mention.

630
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:03,500
We found your nephew's DNA.
Wanna know where?

631
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:09,220
-Beneath the victim's fingernails.
-You're bluffing.

632
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:23,540
Here it is.

633
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:36,940
They both work here,
I think.

634
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:39,260
What the fuck
can they be doing here?

635
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:44,820
To be, or not to...

636
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:46,500
be.

637
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:48,500
That is the question.

638
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:52,940
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind

639
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:54,420
to suffer the slings

640
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:58,340
and arrows
of outrageous fortune,

641
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:02,900
or to take arms against a sea of
troubles and by opposing end them.

642
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:04,260
To die.

643
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:06,540
To sleep.

644
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:08,660
To sleep?

645
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:10,980
Perchance to dream.

646
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:17,540
Excuse me.

647
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:20,500
We're looking for a young woman
named Salomé.

648
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:24,220
You're interrupting Hamlet, sir.
You're interrupting Shakespeare.

649
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:25,780
Do you respect actors?

650
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:28,260
I may be bothering you,
but it's very important.

651
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:30,940
It's a matter of life or death.

652
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:33,220
-First one on the left.
-Thank you.

653
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:35,540
From the top.

654
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:46,420
Did you know he danced?

655
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:53,940
His mother was a dance teacher.
I knew she brought him along, but...

656
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:57,820
But I didn't know that... No.

657
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:01,220
You still have
a lot to learn about him.

658
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:05,980
-Is that his girlfriend?
-That's me.

659
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:11,420
-I didn't expect to see him here.
-And yet this is our home.

660
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:14,620
Where is he?
I desperately need to speak to him.

661
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:16,940
-I'm not a snitch.
-I need to see him.

662
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:19,820
-The cops want to talk to him.
-What do they want?

663
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:21,860
There was a murder.
He's the main suspect.

664
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:26,340
-It wasn't him.
-I know, that's not the issue.

665
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:28,260
I bet you he won't talk to them.

666
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:30,140
Do you love him?

667
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:32,860
I might.

668
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:38,420
Then try and convince him to come.

669
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:41,700
Nobody can. You're
his father, you should know that.

670
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:46,100
Well then, just tell him

671
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,420
that I need to see him.

672
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:52,540
And also tell him
that I'm proud of him.

673
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:07,980
Good evening.

674
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:11,260
-Good evening, madam.
-Evening, Jennifer.

675
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:14,700
This is his truck, no?

676
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,660
Let's see...

677
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:29,660
There we are.

678
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:34,140
Now we know why he was driving
further than the others.

679
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:35,260
Because of this.

680
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:38,300
-Is that soil?
-Soil...

681
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,300
Did your mother teach you nothing?

682
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:41,700
Soil, this?

683
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:48,100
No, this is pot, hash,
a drug that is soft...

684
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:50,580
but illegal.
So, your nephew,

685
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:53,940
was using the truck to traffic drugs
between Spain and France.

686
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:58,100
Morales must've caught on right away,
what with her cost-cutting obsession.

687
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:00,100
Well, what would you have done?

688
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:05,540
-I don't know.
-I think I would have fired him.

689
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:08,820
-Fired my nephew?
-Yes, booted his ass right out.

690
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:10,940
Maybe that's playing it too safe.

691
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:13,300
I would have blackmailed him.

692
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:16,100
The kid mustn't have liked that.

693
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:18,420
Which makes sense, I get it.

694
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:21,980
Shall we smoke ourselves a doobie?

695
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:28,100
I'm just kidding!

696
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:31,740
-When the gendarmerie...
-What a nutcase.

697
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:50,660
Pirouette, peanut...

698
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:58,020
There was once a little man

699
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:01,700
Pirouette, peanut

700
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:04,660
There was once a little man

701
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:07,660
Who had a very curious house

702
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:11,020
Who had a very curious house

703
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:14,260
And it was a cardboard house

704
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:17,100
Pirouette, peanut

705
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:18,980
It was a cardboard house...

706
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:29,380
Are you nuts, you scared me!

707
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:30,940
I wanted to be the first.

708
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:34,140
-The first to what?
-Why, to wish you a happy birthday.

709
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:36,940
Well, you won, you're the first.

710
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:38,300
Here.

711
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:41,100
Pierrot, you shouldn't have.

712
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:44,900
I'm a bit ashamed, I don't even
know your birthday.

713
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:47,300
Doesn't matter, it's not
about me. Open it.

714
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:53,380
Heavens, you're mad, Pierrot!

715
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:56,020
-This is far too much!
-Do you like it?

716
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:58,140
Well, of course.

717
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:00,460
-I really picked it out for you.
-Thank you.

718
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:17,900
Dad's car!
You got it back?

719
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:19,740
I had it repaired for you.

720
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:22,180
You'll have to pass
the technical controls.

721
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:32,900
Honestly.

722
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:35,540
Did you think I would
forget your birthday?

723
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:37,420
No.

724
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:42,700
Happy birthday.

725
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:27,300
Happy birthday, sweetie.
To us.

726
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:29,460
-And to Samuel.
-To us.

727
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:34,620
We're going to figure this out.
We always did.

728
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:44,460
Look at that lake.
It's its birthday, too.

729
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:46,540
It's been twenty-seven years.

730
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:50,980
Twenty-seven years that our hiding
places have been covered in water.

731
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:54,300
Do you remember? That little village?

732
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:58,420
Once in a while, the steeple
comes poking back out. It's strange.

733
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:00,340
Do you remember that?

734
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:02,300
Of course.

735
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:04,980
You don't forget anything.

736
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:07,900
You tuck it away in the secret
drawers of memory.

737
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:15,340
-What happened to you there?
-Oh, this? It's nothing.

738
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:18,340
Must've grazed myself getting
out of the pick-up.

739
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:20,060
And do you remember this?

740
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:23,300
Oh yes, I remember that.

741
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:26,460
You said that if you blew on it,
it would heal.

742
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:27,500
That's right.

743
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:33,860
-Blanche.
-Hello Samuel, how are you honey?

744
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:38,740
-You wanted to see me?
-Manuella was killed.

745
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:41,580
The cops want to get
your statement.

746
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:42,980
They think you did it.

747
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:46,860
Security footage shows you slapping
her. Why did you do that?

748
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:50,260
-Give him a second to take it in!
-None of your business.

749
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:53,700
-It was between her and me.
-Yes, but she was killed afterwards.

750
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:58,220
-I didn't do anything.
-We know that, honey.

751
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:02,980
Well, tell that to the cops, then.

752
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:04,900
You think I'd do such a thing?

753
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:07,740
No, he doesn't think that!

754
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:09,180
I can see it in his eyes.

755
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:13,420
You're thinking your fucking son
fucked up again! You never trust me.

756
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:15,580
I told you I quit!

757
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:18,060
Sure, you say you kicked the habit,

758
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:21,780
but then sneak hash into your dad's
trucks. Of course he's mad!

759
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:24,140
Hey!

760
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:27,020
No funny business.

761
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:31,220
We're going to go to
the police station, calmly, and chat.

762
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:35,300
You ratted me out, you bastard!

763
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:38,940
-I'll never trust you again!
-We'll let him know. Come on.

764
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:41,860
So?

765
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:51,940
It's true,
Manuella and I had a fight.

766
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:54,700
How come?

767
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:58,020
Was she mad because you were
using up her diesel

768
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:00,700
-for your dumbass trafficking?
-What trafficking?

769
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:02,580
Hey! Stop!

770
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:06,860
We started off bad, but don't you try
and treat me like I'm a dumbass.

771
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:10,140
For heaven's sake.
What's this?

772
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:11,740
What's this?

773
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:14,860
I was young too, once.

774
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:17,860
Ugly, but young. So I know what
that good shit looks like.

775
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:20,740
You think that's funny?
What is that?

776
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:22,780
It's not compost
to grow lettuce in.

777
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:24,900
Chill, it was my stash.

778
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:28,300
For your own stash, you don't need
to go all the way to Barcelona.

779
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:30,900
The party square
is two kilometers away.

780
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:33,580
You can get whatever you want there.
So?

781
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:39,580
You're not the sharpest
tool in the shed, huh?

782
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:42,220
Honestly.

783
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:47,020
I don't know, when you've got
a rotten record like yours,

784
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:49,860
you keep your mouth shut.

785
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:51,620
You watch your step. No?

786
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:57,660
Let me spell it out for you.
You know your darling aunt, Blanche,

787
01:00:58,220 --> 01:01:02,580
she wants to save
your dumb ass.

788
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:03,900
You dig?

789
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:06,860
Except her alibi
is a total piece of shit.

790
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:09,380
Know why?
Because you, in fact,

791
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:13,020
you were carrying hash,
your boss caught you,

792
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:16,860
and you slapped her
and you killed her, simple as that!

793
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:18,660
Sit back down.

794
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:22,220
Where do you think this is?

795
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:25,700
I'm not your mom.

796
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:33,980
So chill out, and then tell me
what's going on. I'm listening.

797
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:38,620
I've transported cannabis
three times.

798
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:41,220
I wanted to get my girlfriend
a real present.

799
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:42,980
And Manuella caught me.

800
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,820
Well that was no reason
to slap her.

801
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:48,500
-That's not why I slapped her!
-Then why did you?

802
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:53,020
I don't know... When I told her it
was for a girl, she went hysterical.

803
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:56,580
She told me I was like my father.

804
01:01:57,220 --> 01:02:00,580
A seducer, a pervert.
So, I don't know, I flipped out.

805
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:04,100
Your father, a seducer?

806
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:07,660
-I thought he'd been alone ten years.
-You don't get it, do you?

807
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:12,140
Manuella was into my father.

808
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:14,340
And he discarded her
like a used tissue.

809
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:32,660
Philippe?

810
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:39,700
Philippe?

811
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:05,940
I decided to come,
you seemed distraught.

812
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:09,540
Yes, Samuel is in custody,
I need a lawyer.

813
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:11,740
Call Dorisse from me.
She's the best.

814
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:15,380
I don't know how to thank you.

815
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:31,540
-You don't know what you want, huh?
-Yes, I do. This is to protect you.

816
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:36,820
That's too easy.
You're the one you're protecting.

817
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:41,860
You're bad luck, so you'd
rather do nothing?

818
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:44,700
Who do you think you're fooling
except you?

819
01:03:45,140 --> 01:03:47,900
You just can't love anyone
other than yourself, that's al!

820
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:53,260
Wait.

821
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:04,820
What's wrong with you?

822
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:09,260
Why are you crying?
Did Philippe Muir hit you?

823
01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:11,660
-No, it's not that.
-What then?

824
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:14,540
Psychological violence?
Did he mistreat you?

825
01:04:15,220 --> 01:04:17,780
Don't go getting any ideas.
He just doesn't want me.

826
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:20,020
Nothing to lock him up over.

827
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:23,020
He's a funny guy,
that one is, isn't he?

828
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:28,820
-He feels guilt for his wife's death.
-Guilt? How so?

829
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:31,100
Not guilty for real.

830
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:35,660
He's convinced all the women he loves
wind up dying because of him.

831
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:41,940
But that's typical.
I've met plenty of killers,

832
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:44,580
of predators.
Through work, obviously.

833
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:47,060
It's strange, but every time,

834
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:49,700
they regret doing it. Really, though.

835
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:50,980
This is not like that.

836
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:54,100
-Philippe Muir isn't a...
-He isn't what?

837
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:56,340
How long have you known him for?

838
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:03,060
We met three months ago, when
I began Samuel's judicial follow-up.

839
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:06,460
And we saw each other again
3 days ago.

840
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:11,220
So you're old childhood friends.
You know him very well, basically.

841
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:13,060
What're you implying?

842
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:15,100
Nothing at all.

843
01:05:15,260 --> 01:05:18,700
If you're accusing him of murdering
Manuella Morales, forget about it.

844
01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:20,580
We spent that night together.

845
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:22,540
He even left at 5 a.m.

846
01:05:22,860 --> 01:05:24,420
Well sure, but...

847
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:28,220
Here's the thing, Manuella Morales
was killed at 6 a.m.

848
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:30,340
Cuts you short, no?

849
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:15,860
-Your dad is here.
-You ready?

850
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:19,980
-What? They let me go?
-Someone testified on your behalf.

851
01:06:21,020 --> 01:06:21,820
Salomé!

852
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:29,780
She said you were together
on the murder night.

853
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:33,020
-You're free.
-Thanks for telling me.

854
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:36,540
-Is it my dad who...
-Yes, he came to get me,

855
01:06:36,740 --> 01:06:37,820
told me you needed me.

856
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:39,460
Where'd he find you?

857
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:42,780
He's already been to the studio, he's
even seen one of your performances.

858
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:44,900
-You having me followed?
-No!

859
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:47,500
-Chill, I invited him.
-You never mentioned the dancing.

860
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:51,380
What would you have done
if I told you I wanted to dance?

861
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:53,460
You only ever wanted one thing:

862
01:06:53,660 --> 01:06:55,900
for me to become a trucker
and take over the business.

863
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:57,500
I did that for you.

864
01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:01,540
-So you wouldn't fall prey to crack.
-But I hate trucks!

865
01:07:01,940 --> 01:07:05,180
I even hate cars.
Engines, tires.

866
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:08,020
Brake pads, highway miles,
that stuff makes me hurl.

867
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:09,100
Look, Samuel,

868
01:07:09,260 --> 01:07:11,460
I don't have much to teach you.

869
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:14,380
So if you want to dance,
and if you're happy...

870
01:07:16,260 --> 01:07:17,260
That's fine with me.

871
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:22,740
Thanks for coming to get me.

872
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:25,220
Thank you.

873
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:35,180
Thanks, dad.

874
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:36,180
Hey, Carpentier!

875
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:37,780
What the hell is this?

876
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:39,900
You let Samuel Muir go?

877
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:43,460
His girlfriend claims they were in
Marseille when it happened.

878
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:44,420
At a rave.

879
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:46,260
They arrived around midnight.

880
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:49,940
-And do we have proof?
-The bouncers remember him well.

881
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:53,060
Samuel was so drunk
they kicked him out at 8 a.m.

882
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:55,460
-It's nice, being young.
-You think?

883
01:08:55,780 --> 01:08:59,100
Between killing a guy
and having to hear 8 hours of techno,

884
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:01,940
not sure I'd choose techno.
Even if I swallowed some E.

885
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:05,220
Well, the alibi was confirmed
by their friends and the bouncers.

886
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:09,620
Yes? Okay.

887
01:09:09,940 --> 01:09:11,460
Captain!

888
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:14,180
Blanche Muir has been
in a car accident.

889
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:16,700
They haven't found
her body yet.

890
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:18,380
Fuck.

891
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:19,900
That was all we needed.

892
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:36,900
...a road accident.

893
01:09:37,060 --> 01:09:39,180
Thank you. You alright, partner?

894
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:43,060
-Hello.
-It's this way.

895
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:49,460
-Where's the body?
-We just found it.

896
01:09:49,620 --> 01:09:51,220
She jumped out before the crash.

897
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:53,620
-She's in there.
-In there?

898
01:09:55,580 --> 01:09:58,300
-Is she going to be okay?
-Yeah, with a few cuts.

899
01:09:58,460 --> 01:09:59,620
Crazy reflexes.

900
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:02,900
-Can I talk to her?
-Not yet, she's totally in shock.

901
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:08,980
Cars sure are dangerous.

902
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:12,060
Especially with Philippe Muir.

903
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:19,860
Hello.

904
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:21,420
Hello.

905
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:24,940
-Have you begun swabbing?
-Yes.

906
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:33,780
I don't usually do autopsies on car.
It's only because it's you.

907
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:36,900
I know, but I thought there was
a stiff in the car.

908
01:10:37,180 --> 01:10:40,100
What's up with this info you gave me?
Dumbasses.

909
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:43,180
Honestly, I'm sorry.
I'm wasting your time.

910
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:46,740
If you like, I can cut into
the engine and wheels.

911
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:50,420
-Can't be too different from a body.
-You'd really do that for me?

912
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:53,060
-Come check it out.
-You're too kind.

913
01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:55,780
Help me, doc.

914
01:10:57,700 --> 01:10:59,900
Thank you.

915
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:02,860
Here, you see?

916
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:08,900
-That's ugly, that is.
-Real ugly.

917
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:13,020
You think you could do a quick
swab for fingerprints?

918
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:15,540
-That would be a huge help.
-I'll do what I can.

919
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:19,100
But you were right to get me to come.

920
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:22,860
The woman driving this car
really should have died.

921
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:27,300
Well, that's what the guy who
cut the break line right there

922
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:28,860
wanted to make happen.

923
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:31,780
Alright, I'll let you get back to it.
Thank you.

924
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:37,340
-So, how are you doing?
-Great.

925
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:39,260
Just a couple scratches.

926
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:42,260
No kidding, I was very lucky.

927
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:45,020
It all depends on
your point of view.

928
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:48,100
Well, the car definitely
wasn't as lucky.

929
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:51,060
It's too bad,
it was our father's car.

930
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:55,620
Philippe had just gotten it back
and given it to me for my birthday.

931
01:11:57,220 --> 01:12:00,580
And tell me, your brother's
first wife, Héloïse.

932
01:12:00,740 --> 01:12:02,380
How did she die, exactly?

933
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:05,260
-A car accident.
-That so.

934
01:12:05,540 --> 01:12:06,900
How strange, just like you.

935
01:12:07,420 --> 01:12:10,220
Am I losing it
or is there a pattern?

936
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:12,740
She fell asleep behind the wheel.

937
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:15,100
I'm sure someone
could have drugged her.

938
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:18,460
-Someone did cut your break line.
-That was just wear and tear.

939
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:21,780
-It was an old car.
-Wear and tear, sure.

940
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:25,500
Look, captain...

941
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:28,660
My brother loves me.
We're everything to each other.

942
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:31,140
He would never have wanted
to kill me, never.

943
01:12:32,020 --> 01:12:33,100
Well, that's just it.

944
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:36,140
I suspect him of killing
all of the women he loves.

945
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:40,140
You see, there was his first wife,
Héloïse: yeek.

946
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:44,380
His accountant Manuella, yeek two.
And you, a near-yeek.

947
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:46,860
If I'm right,
we'll have to arrest him.

948
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:50,460
Because otherwise
his new girlfriend's in trouble.

949
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:54,860
What? You didn't know?
He's having a liaison.

950
01:12:57,140 --> 01:12:59,180
Philippe Muir.

951
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:00,580
You'll need to follow me.

952
01:13:01,060 --> 01:13:02,540
-Philippe.
-Yes.

953
01:13:02,740 --> 01:13:04,660
She says you have
a new girlfriend.

954
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:08,700
She's lying, isn't she?

955
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:10,340
No...

956
01:13:11,980 --> 01:13:15,100
I forgot to tell you.
It's Cécile Castelnau.

957
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:18,420
Want me to do anything?

958
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:22,660
Yes, if ever I don't come back,
would you mind letting her know?

959
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:25,380
Thank you.

960
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:26,780
Let's go.

961
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:40,860
Tell me, Mr. Muir, do you murder
all the ladies who love you?

962
01:13:41,860 --> 01:13:44,540
Because right now, it's 17:23.

963
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:46,060
You'll be in custody.

964
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:48,220
For the murder of Manuella Morales.

965
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:57,100
Let's recap.

966
01:13:58,180 --> 01:14:02,060
You spent the night at
Cécile Castelnau's place, right?

967
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:04,300
And then, you, and I quote:

968
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:06,740
"Wandered around the streets
for an hour."

969
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:08,940
Of course, given the time,
nobody saw you?

970
01:14:09,260 --> 01:14:10,100
Yes.

971
01:14:10,540 --> 01:14:11,700
Yes, there was, uh...

972
01:14:12,540 --> 01:14:15,380
There was a trailer
with an old woman nearby.

973
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:18,940
And she took my hand
and told me that I...

974
01:14:20,180 --> 01:14:23,260
was going to have a bad day.

975
01:14:23,780 --> 01:14:24,900
She had no idea.

976
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:27,540
A bad day?

977
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:31,980
That's a bit rich,
because a bad day...

978
01:14:32,620 --> 01:14:36,140
You did have a nice little roll
in the hay with Cécile,

979
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:38,300
just before.
A nice one nighter, hey?

980
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:40,180
Without the domestic life bullshit.

981
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:42,460
Ain't that groovy?
That's the dream, no?

982
01:14:42,660 --> 01:14:44,100
You don't get it at all.

983
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:45,140
Really?

984
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:49,820
All I wanted to do was to go back
and hold Cécile.

985
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:52,940
And to sleep until the next day.

986
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:58,740
I don't get why you didn't, then.

987
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:02,060
And I feel like it's not bad
with her, is it?

988
01:15:02,220 --> 01:15:03,860
You're pretty popular, no?

989
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:05,900
No?

990
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:09,500
-You not going to answer, Mr. Muir ?
-You couldn't understand.

991
01:15:10,460 --> 01:15:12,500
Whenever I love a woman,
she dies.

992
01:15:14,060 --> 01:15:14,900
That's it.

993
01:15:16,420 --> 01:15:19,180
I know it seems ridiculous,
but that's the way it is.

994
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:21,060
No, it's not ridiculous.

995
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:23,620
Up until then,
we pretty much agree.

996
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:26,620
The women
who hang out around you

997
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:29,580
have a higher-than-average
death rate.

998
01:15:30,540 --> 01:15:36,180
A premature death rate. Violent, too.
You know what we're going to do?

999
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:38,340
We're going to start over.

1000
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:41,900
And you're going to explain
how you kill all of them.

1001
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:44,540
Go ahead, I'm listening.

1002
01:15:54,940 --> 01:15:57,860
Alright, so you've
identified the fingerprints?

1003
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:01,220
Thanks, old pal.

1004
01:16:01,860 --> 01:16:04,300
It's a present I promised
to someone dear to me.

1005
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:08,860
What's wrong? Have you never
wanted to please a woman?

1006
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:19,300
I'll be right back.

1007
01:16:24,340 --> 01:16:26,540
Yeah.
Oh, hello.

1008
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:31,420
Alright, my dear friend.
I know who sabotaged the car.

1009
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:33,820
Really? Well, you better watch out.

1010
01:16:33,980 --> 01:16:35,940
I'm close to asking you to marry me.

1011
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:39,620
Just an inch.

1012
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:42,820
-Still no news from Blanche?
-No, she hasn't arrived, yet.

1013
01:16:42,980 --> 01:16:43,820
What's she up to?

1014
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:52,540
Mr. Lacoudre,
did I forget to tell you?

1015
01:16:52,740 --> 01:16:55,540
-You're under arrest.
-What?

1016
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:56,540
Yes, follow me.

1017
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:01,980
Blanche is in the hospital.

1018
01:17:02,140 --> 01:17:04,500
You didn't kill her,
which really pisses you off!

1019
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:07,900
You wanted her to die
when you cut her brake wires.

1020
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:10,780
I wanted to wreck her car,
not to hurt her.

1021
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:11,980
Stop it.

1022
01:17:12,180 --> 01:17:15,420
I saw you having a fight with her
one morning.

1023
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:18,260
You resented her
because she wasn't in love with you.

1024
01:17:18,420 --> 01:17:19,860
No, it's her birthday.

1025
01:17:20,020 --> 01:17:21,900
I got her a necklace,
I spent over two hours

1026
01:17:22,060 --> 01:17:23,460
picking it out in the shop.

1027
01:17:23,740 --> 01:17:26,300
And she put it down on a table
and forgot about it.

1028
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:29,740
-That's no reason to kill someone.
-Put yourself in my shoes.

1029
01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:33,500
I give her some jewelry, and then
that asshole shows up with a car.

1030
01:17:34,060 --> 01:17:35,780
He's her whole life,
her brother!

1031
01:17:36,180 --> 01:17:39,660
-And you can't stand her brother.
-No. Philippe this, Philippe that.

1032
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:42,900
Yeah, I get that.
All this "Philippe" stuff

1033
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:44,700
gets old after a while.

1034
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:46,020
So is that why?

1035
01:17:46,220 --> 01:17:49,180
You took your revenge because he's
popular with the ladies?

1036
01:17:49,380 --> 01:17:51,220
-You get what I'm saying?
-No, I don't.

1037
01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:54,820
Sure, so you killed all the girls
who were hovering around him.

1038
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:57,860
-His wife...
-Hang on, no.

1039
01:17:58,100 --> 01:18:00,780
I wrecked the car,
I'll give you that.

1040
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:03,700
But I didn't know his wife.
I've been here for 4 years.

1041
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:06,460
-That bullshit true?
-Yes.

1042
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:09,140
Fuck. Stay there, don't move.

1043
01:18:09,540 --> 01:18:10,740
Carpentier!

1044
01:18:12,580 --> 01:18:14,620
Mr. Muir, come with me.

1045
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:16,220
Hurry up, quick!

1046
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:22,820
-Where are we going right now?
-You'll see, hurry your ass up.

1047
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:38,940
I'm not superstitious.
It's bad luck, knock on wood.

1048
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:42,060
This whole curse story of yours...

1049
01:19:42,380 --> 01:19:45,460
I've been trying to find
a rational explanation for it.

1050
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:49,860
-I don't get it.
-You say all the women you love die.

1051
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:53,220
Except that you don't die,
there's always someone by your side.

1052
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:56,780
Someone protecting you,
someone who loves you.

1053
01:19:56,980 --> 01:19:59,180
And who even loves you more
than all the women

1054
01:19:59,380 --> 01:20:01,660
and all the guys
you'll love in your life.

1055
01:20:01,860 --> 01:20:03,020
You know who I mean?

1056
01:20:05,660 --> 01:20:07,060
For instance, with Héloïse.

1057
01:20:07,740 --> 01:20:09,980
When you were supposed
to find a house,

1058
01:20:10,780 --> 01:20:12,900
you cancelled your trip.
Why?

1059
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:16,980
Because someone sent you to the other
side of France on a delivery.

1060
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:21,220
You aren't cursed
like some old king, sir.

1061
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:23,460
It's your sister.
She's totally nuts.

1062
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:26,980
I mean real fucking nuts.

1063
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:33,300
Stop following me.
Go on, scram.

1064
01:20:34,820 --> 01:20:37,140
Wait for me here,
I'm going up there alone.

1065
01:20:41,820 --> 01:20:44,420
I said wait, that's an order.

1066
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:47,220
Can't you read?

1067
01:20:56,820 --> 01:20:59,420
-Put your hands in the air!
-Move, and I'll shoot!

1068
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:01,300
Put your weapon down.

1069
01:21:02,180 --> 01:21:04,380
-Put your weapon down.
-Yeah, okay.

1070
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:05,500
There.

1071
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:07,580
Stay calm, okay?

1072
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:10,860
There.

1073
01:21:11,380 --> 01:21:13,060
Everything's fine.

1074
01:21:14,980 --> 01:21:16,020
Everything's fine.

1075
01:21:20,620 --> 01:21:22,140
Let her go, Blanche.

1076
01:21:23,220 --> 01:21:25,180
She didn't do anything.

1077
01:21:25,740 --> 01:21:26,900
Philippe, you're here.

1078
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:28,740
Yes.

1079
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:30,780
Come on now, Blanche.

1080
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:35,220
Give me that gun.

1081
01:21:35,780 --> 01:21:37,420
You're going to hurt yourself.

1082
01:21:38,140 --> 01:21:39,780
Come on.

1083
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:41,660
-Come here.
-Your brother's right.

1084
01:21:41,780 --> 01:21:43,500
Come on, give me that.

1085
01:21:43,860 --> 01:21:46,180
I promise I'll let you both
talk in peace.

1086
01:21:46,380 --> 01:21:48,780
Let her go,
she has nothing to do with this.

1087
01:21:49,060 --> 01:21:50,940
Do you really love this woman,
Philippe?

1088
01:21:55,060 --> 01:21:57,420
No, Blanche.

1089
01:21:58,180 --> 01:21:59,220
I only love you.

1090
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:01,220
Come on.

1091
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:03,380
Give me that gun.

1092
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:07,940
Then we can talk.
Just you and me, okay?

1093
01:22:08,380 --> 01:22:11,780
Do as he says. It's your only
hope of getting out of this.

1094
01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:13,660
Look...

1095
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:15,500
You're bleeding.

1096
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:18,500
Give me your weapon.

1097
01:22:19,620 --> 01:22:22,580
I'll blow on your hurt spot,
want me to?

1098
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:26,020
No, don't move, you!

1099
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:30,500
Philippe!

1100
01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:31,940
No!

1101
01:22:40,780 --> 01:22:42,100
Come on, Blanche.

1102
01:22:46,940 --> 01:22:47,780
Come on.

1103
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:58,660
I could never stand the idea
of seeing him with other women.

1104
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:05,380
First, there was Julia.

1105
01:23:06,140 --> 01:23:08,620
He was spending more and more
time with her.

1106
01:23:08,820 --> 01:23:11,100
On Sundays, he barely even
came home for lunch.

1107
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:16,180
One night, I was coming back
from a party, I was drunk.

1108
01:23:16,420 --> 01:23:19,060
And then, in front of me,
in my car's headlights,

1109
01:23:19,220 --> 01:23:20,380
I saw her on the road.

1110
01:23:21,780 --> 01:23:22,500
I sped up.

1111
01:23:23,820 --> 01:23:26,820
I hadn't planned it at all.
That's just how it happened.

1112
01:23:27,340 --> 01:23:28,180
There you go.

1113
01:23:28,980 --> 01:23:30,660
Then, there was Héloïse.

1114
01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:34,460
I really liked her.

1115
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:39,180
Things could've gone on
as they were, but she had

1116
01:23:39,340 --> 01:23:41,100
to want to move back to Spain,

1117
01:23:41,260 --> 01:23:43,380
to bring both Philippe
and Samuel with her.

1118
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:45,500
That's when you sent
Philippe to Lille?

1119
01:23:46,820 --> 01:23:48,540
Yes, that's right.

1120
01:23:48,780 --> 01:23:52,500
And I told Héloïse
I'd accompany her for a bit.

1121
01:23:52,940 --> 01:23:57,220
I left her in Madrid, after dropping
a sleeping pill in her glass.

1122
01:23:59,540 --> 01:24:00,740
And then...

1123
01:24:01,460 --> 01:24:03,900
Life began its course once more.

1124
01:24:04,580 --> 01:24:08,100
We were all together,
Philippe, Samuel, and I.

1125
01:24:09,660 --> 01:24:12,620
Just like a real family,
that's all I can call it.

1126
01:24:13,820 --> 01:24:14,660
And then...

1127
01:24:16,220 --> 01:24:17,620
He had to do it again.

1128
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:26,740
Alright...

1129
01:24:32,180 --> 01:24:33,500
Come on in.

1130
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:36,540
You can take her.

1131
01:24:43,580 --> 01:24:45,660
Couldn't he have just
controlled himself?

1132
01:24:45,860 --> 01:24:48,220
You see what kinds of situations
he gets us into!

1133
01:24:48,380 --> 01:24:50,180
This fucking idiot!

1134
01:24:50,380 --> 01:24:51,660
Fucking idiot!

1135
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:04,380
Hey there!

1136
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:12,900
Welcome to paradise.

1137
01:25:13,860 --> 01:25:17,380
Captain Marleau and her crew
wish you an enjoyable stay.

1138
01:25:18,020 --> 01:25:20,100
I wanted to bring you some flowers.

1139
01:25:20,260 --> 01:25:25,100
But it seemed somber, so I brought
this. Do they not have glasses, here?

1140
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:29,700
Well, we'll drink it out the bottle.
You know much about wine?

1141
01:25:30,540 --> 01:25:32,660
This one's supposed to be good.
From Aniane.

1142
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:35,820
Cheers!

1143
01:25:37,460 --> 01:25:38,620
I prefer beer, myself.

1144
01:25:39,060 --> 01:25:40,700
You want some?

1145
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:42,220
No, thank you.

1146
01:25:43,540 --> 01:25:44,540
You see, Mr. Muir?

1147
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:48,900
Your curse story was a bunch
of bullshit. There's no such thing.

1148
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:51,100
So now, if you want to be in love,

1149
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:53,980
there aren't too many risks.
But cover up!

1150
01:25:55,540 --> 01:25:56,260
Ouch!

1151
01:25:59,420 --> 01:26:02,260
You're making a mistake,
this stuff's good.

1152
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:32,900
Cécile.

1153
01:26:47,780 --> 01:26:48,700
It's here, is it?

1154
01:26:55,100 --> 01:26:57,380
And here we are.

1155
01:26:59,020 --> 01:27:01,100
-Rassomon?
-Rashômon.

1156
01:27:01,820 --> 01:27:02,660
The restaurant

1157
01:27:02,860 --> 01:27:05,660
where they make the delicious sushis
that we found

1158
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:08,380
in the stomach of Manuella Morales!

1159
01:27:08,540 --> 01:27:09,660
That's so nice!

1160
01:27:17,380 --> 01:27:19,380
Yes, bravo!

1161
01:27:19,540 --> 01:27:21,260
That's great!

1162
01:27:21,420 --> 01:27:23,260
I'd believe in god and shit.

1163
01:27:23,380 --> 01:27:25,660
Honestly, it's awesome.

1164
01:27:27,380 --> 01:27:28,940
So?

1165
01:27:29,540 --> 01:27:32,780
Afterwards, well, if you want,

1166
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:37,260
I've got a bit of Chartreuse

1167
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:38,540
at home.

1168
01:27:39,380 --> 01:27:42,420
It's delightful.

1169
01:27:42,580 --> 01:27:45,540
It's like baby Jesus

1170
01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:47,700
in velvet underpants.

1171
01:27:50,580 --> 01:27:53,700
I don't like underwear. It's itchy.
But I'm game.

1172
01:27:54,220 --> 01:27:55,980
There's just one thing, though.

1173
01:27:56,380 --> 01:27:58,540
I only put out on the first date.

1174
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:01,540
That's perfect, works for me.

1175
01:28:04,100 --> 01:28:05,260
Let's eat first.

1176
01:29:16,300 --> 01:29:18,540
Subtitling: Hiventy
