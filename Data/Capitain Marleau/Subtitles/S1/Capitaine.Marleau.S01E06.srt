1
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,360
Mirror, mirror,

2
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,320
who is the ugliest
in the police force?

3
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:38,880
Huh?

4
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,240
Captain Marleau!

5
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,480
CAPTAIN MARLEAU

6
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,320
Don't worry about it!
Make yourself at home!

7
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,760
Ah...

8
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,480
Are you the Satyr of these woods?

9
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,440
I'm the owner.

10
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,080
Some people have no manners!

11
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,280
The public track is over there,

12
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,000
and this is private property.

13
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,520
I love hazelnut-smelling
prohibited tracks.

14
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,320
It's the law.

15
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,880
Is the stupidest law is the best one?
I'm in luck then.

16
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,880
Sorry, I'm in a hurry.

17
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,440
We're off on the right foot!

18
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,520
Not there!

19
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,040
Yes!

20
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,480
Idiot!
You'll see!

21
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,320
THE NIGHT OF THE RED MOON

22
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,200
POLICE

23
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,320
So?

24
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,160
Sorry, it just finished.

25
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,280
The next episode is at 2:00 a.m.

26
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,520
No way! Can't they do reruns?
I hate that!

27
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,880
The red moon is the most beautiful

28
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,040
because it was in the most beautiful
skies that this immortal appeared.

29
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,080
I'm thirsty for blood, mortal.

30
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,520
I'll eat you, Little Red Riding Hood!

31
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,080
Shut up!

32
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,120
It's serious, Léonard.
This isn't a joke.

33
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,000
You can wait in the car, Manon.

34
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,200
-You promised!
-And you promised to shut up!

35
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,000
Go and wait over there.

36
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,240
-What's the worst that can happen?
-Yeah?

37
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,600
Apparently Chalard hired a guard.

38
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,120
Maybe it's just a rumor,
but we don't know.

39
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,520
Come on, Julien. Let's do a selfie.

40
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,920
-A souvenir.
-Come on.

41
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,760
Ready...

42
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,680
Cheese!

43
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,480
I'll come back with you.

44
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,240
Then we separate, as we said. OK?

45
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,320
Does he think he's God's sidekick.

46
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,200
Don't say that, poor mortal.
He is God.

47
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,240
Amen.

48
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,400
NO TO THE GOLF COURSE

49
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,920
Yeah, that's great.

50
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,840
Little rascals!

51
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,240
I'll make you scatter, you sparrows.

52
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,320
-Run!
-Léonard!

53
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,600
Léonard!

54
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,840
Julien!

55
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,080
Julien!

56
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,760
Julien!

57
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,000
Julien!

58
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,840
You know, dear,

59
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,480
-I wanted to tell you a secret.
-What secret, Mom?

60
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,480
Alexis isn't who you think.
He's your...

61
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,920
Your what? Your brother?
Your murderer?

62
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,320
Your dad? Damn!

63
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,280
Where's the circuit breaker?

64
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,200
Damn it!

65
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,240
Alain Peras, Entzheim mayor,
we've lost electricity.

66
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,240
Please send a team quickly.

67
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,400
Shine it higher.

68
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,400
What did they say?

69
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,000
Answering machine.
Third time this year.

70
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,360
I'll have to keep the landline
all day.

71
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,920
You can just not pick up.

72
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,760
After all, you came for nothing.

73
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,920
I can't leave people in the dark.

74
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,360
You mean you can't leave people

75
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,960
in the dark before elections?

76
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,680
Are you afraid
they'll vote for Chalard?

77
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,560
You never know with these people.

78
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,240
Hammer, please.

79
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,360
It's not starting.

80
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,280
It just needs a feminine touch.

81
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,760
And Jeanne said:
"Let there be light!"

82
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,280
And there was light.

83
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,120
And sly and cruel,

84
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,840
she let him leave in the dark
and the rain.

85
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,720
He, who hoped to snore by her side
till the morning.

86
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,800
Because she thought that hell
could always wait.

87
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,520
Have you thought about it?

88
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,400
Listen, Alain...

89
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,200
I love you, you love me,
we love each other.

90
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,560
We don't want to lose what we have.

91
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,280
And what if it's important to me?

92
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,280
Why? Huh? Can you explain?

93
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,400
Why now?

94
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,200
We've been together three years.

95
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,720
-What will it change?
-Maybe you don't care, but

96
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,080
getting married means something
to me.

97
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,520
Yes, you're right.

98
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,640
I don't care about marriage. Come on.

99
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,560
Manon? Manon,
what are you doing there?

100
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,120
What's wrong?

101
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,720
We wanted... we wanted to put up
a banner to protest the golf course

102
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,280
-and he's dead.
-Who's dead?

103
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,560
-Chalard?
-No.

104
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,080
Léonard.

105
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,920
Jeanne, Léonard died in my arms.

106
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,640
And someone else,
but I don't know who.

107
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,360
But he's dead, too.

108
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,160
Hi, Jeanne...

109
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,560
Think of me from time to time.

110
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,880
Don't worry, it's OK.

111
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,000
It's OK.

112
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,600
-Captain. How are you?
-Hi, Brière.

113
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,520
It's cold today.

114
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,400
Hi, Captain.

115
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,280
-Comrades.
-Thank you.

116
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,560
So, where's Oscar?

117
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,800
-With the body.
-Ah...

118
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,840
-Can you get me a coffee?
-Sure.

119
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,000
Oscar! Hi! It's nice to see you!
Give me a kiss!

120
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,720
It's a pleasure, Captain.

121
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,520
You're still uptight.

122
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,160
You won't forgive me.

123
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,400
-So?
-There it is.

124
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,680
Poor thing...

125
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,400
It should be illegal to die so young.
What happened?

126
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,440
He fell.

127
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,120
A fall of about 5.5 meters.

128
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,000
He fell on his head

129
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,320
causing compression
of the spinal cord,

130
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,880
which would have caused quadriplegia.

131
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,880
But that's not the cause of death.

132
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,560
He died from a heart attack
after muscle paralysis.

133
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,320
His posture was tense.

134
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,520
Time of death: 2:08 a.m.

135
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,160
-08? That's very precise...
-His watch.

136
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,680
It stopped on impact.

137
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,600
Do we have his papers?

138
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,720
No, he didn't have them.
But the mayor is there.

139
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,720
He should know who it is.

140
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,880
A kid killed at the top of a tree
at 2:00 a.m., disguised as Zorro.

141
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,160
They say we should guide the youth.
It disgusts me.

142
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,480
We're off again...

143
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,280
I saw him a few times
at the Milles Sources cafe.

144
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,560
They're a bit loud,
but they don't hurt anyone.

145
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,120
Excuse me.

146
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,440
When there's a blackout,
I suddenly become God.

147
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,120
Yes, Geneviève?

148
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,880
Get me another one. That's horrible.

149
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,000
Thanks, bye.

150
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,440
All this to sort out...
There's a dead girl.

151
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,040
But I'm not the mayor.

152
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:51,000
The mayor needs to sort out
the big dramas and the small ones.

153
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,880
-Do you still need me?
-No.

154
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,440
Yes! Because yesterday,
I met the owner of the dump,

155
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,840
and it was like love at first sight.

156
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,880
I want to see him again. Who is it?

157
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,040
Michel Chalard.
A businessman from Entzheim.

158
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,480
He worked in Bordeaux
and he inherited this land.

159
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,880
He's doing something big.
A golf course, entertainment.

160
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,440
That's good
for your electoral campaign.

161
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,880
First: jobs,
second: jobs,

162
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,280
and third: jobs!

163
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,320
It's good for him.
He's running against me.

164
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,440
Captain!
Captain!

165
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,680
There's a new body.

166
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,280
This isn't possible.
What is it about here?

167
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,120
1943 Mauser cartridge,

168
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,640
shot recently.

169
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,720
Ah, there you are.

170
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,000
There's no bullet wound.
How did he die?

171
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,400
There are dead people
everywhere here.

172
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,120
Well, what do we have?

173
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,000
At first glance,

174
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,440
the only wound is a blow
to the left side of the face.

175
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,880
Violent but the only one.

176
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,320
You're telling me that

177
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,440
he was struck and died unconscious?

178
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,480
Some bad luck.

179
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,280
His color is black
and his number is zero.

180
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,320
Given the wound, I'd say
the butt of a Mauser 43.

181
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,600
-From where the shell comes.
-The shell...

182
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,720
So, what's his name?

183
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,920
Robert Perdriel, security guard.

184
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,600
He lived alone with his cat.
I know the type.

185
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,760
What was he guarding here

186
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,640
apart from trees and nettles?

187
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,880
This morning, when I arrived,
I saw tire tracks.

188
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,440
Like a quick getaway.

189
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,480
-I think there were at least three.
-Why do you say that?

190
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,480
Footsteps near the tree.

191
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,560
And I found this.

192
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,080
A bit of black synthetic tissue,

193
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,720
burned by an iron.

194
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,000
-A piece of Zorro's cape.
-Yeah?

195
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,440
Sometimes, I just want to kiss you.
I don't know what stops me.

196
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,000
Your breath, maybe.

197
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,160
With your permission, I'm off
to my corpses.

198
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,280
Captain! Captain, look what I found.

199
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,440
What is it?
Do you smoke joints?

200
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,280
-I found it near the body.
-Which one? There's plenty.

201
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,200
The second one.

202
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,640
-The big one?
-Yeah.

203
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,440
Good work.

204
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,920
-What did you find?
-Something from Zorro.

205
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,200
To the left, there's Entzheim
about ten kilometers away.

206
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,480
On the right is Ms. Dewaere's
animal park,

207
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,560
the mayor's girlfriend.

208
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,000
Is she the type to climb trees
in a Zorro mask?

209
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,720
In some senses, yes, but... no.

210
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,200
-Do you get it?
-No.

211
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,600
I prefer my jokes to be direct.

212
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,440
Look, Captain.

213
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,000
What are you doing?
You're like a dog.

214
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,440
We're lucky.

215
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,160
Barbie bunny!

216
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,040
The things we find in this forest!
Here.

217
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,040
Go and get my car, we'll meet
at Ms. Dewaere's, OK?

218
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,600
-No, I'd prefer to come with you...
-No.

219
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,000
Fusion couples are like fusion jazz,
I hate it.

220
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:32,320
A bunny killed a hunter...

221
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,920
It was a bunny who

222
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,160
had a rifle.

223
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,000
WOLF VALLEY

224
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,880
Ms. Dewaere's car left at about 3:00

225
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,000
and the dog barked at around 3:30.

226
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,440
I don't know why.

227
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,040
Did you hear a shot?

228
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,040
Yes, maybe. I think I did.

229
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,160
As it was during the blackout,
I thought nothing of it.

230
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,040
Someone fired?

231
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,520
Yeah, it came
from Michel Chalard's wood.

232
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,640
A shot from a 1943 rifle.

233
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,920
-A Mauser.
-A Mauser 43?

234
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,600
That's from the war.

235
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,760
Who has these guns?

236
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,800
-I thought you'd tell me.
-No, sorry,

237
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,040
but I would've noticed
a rifle like that.

238
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,600
-OK, thanks.
-No problem.

239
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,960
Ah, Mr. Gabriel,

240
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,800
I want to show you something,
if I can find it in this mess...

241
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,600
A scarf from a Renaud concert.

242
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,240
Do you know who owns this?

243
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,800
No, I don't.

244
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,040
It's not mine.

245
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,200
OK.

246
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,160
It's nice here.

247
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,440
I like Alsace. I come back often.

248
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,160
It's really nice.

249
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
is there only one entry to the park?

250
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,480
Yes, the main entry.

251
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,040
After, people drive around
like they want.

252
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,440
-I'll let my boss know.
-OK.

253
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,640
-She doesn't like authority.
-She's not the only one.

254
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,760
Yeah. Dangerous liaisons...
They maintain passion, as...

255
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,640
Malkovich or Werther said...

256
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,360
Get up. The police are here.

257
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,160
Hurry up, you're explaining
to them. Get up.

258
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,200
Jeanne, don't make me do it.
The judge can't put me away.

259
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,680
He'll jump on it.

260
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,600
You can't make me.
I've tried hard, Jeanne.

261
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,320
Six years in the clink, Jeanne.

262
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,080
I can't. I'd prefer to die.

263
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,960
You're so annoying.

264
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,920
And I'm an idiot.

265
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,480
Come on.

266
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,480
I'll get you when they've left.

267
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,640
Wait, Jeanne. I can't find my phone.

268
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,880
It must be in the room. I'll find it.

269
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,960
Don't move.

270
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,040
It's hot here.

271
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,200
Les Bidochons, I love it.

272
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,320
-Make yourself at home.
-Thank you.

273
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,400
-Is that your son?
-No, not at all.

274
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,160
It's Mr. Louis, the old guard.

275
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,080
Funny you thought he was my son,
we were the same age.

276
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,760
He died more than 15 years ago.

277
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,040
He has no wrinkles.

278
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,880
-Me, on the other hand...
-Yeah.

279
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,520
I took over his lodge and changed
the decor.

280
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,200
I have simple tastes. I'm an old guy.

281
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,040
-Ah... excuse me.
-It's OK.

282
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,480
Hello?

283
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:55,840
Yeah.

284
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,560
OK, I'll tell him.

285
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,040
-OK
-Poor thing.

286
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,960
Goodbye.

287
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,240
She said you can go to see her.

288
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,480
She seems gruff, but she's nice.

289
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,960
Yeah. I see.

290
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,360
Do you want to live a boring life?

291
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,960
With no fun?

292
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,800
Do you know what adrenaline is?

293
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,080
Risk?

294
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,240
Putting your life on the line?

295
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,480
In ten minutes, max, you have a rush.

296
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,080
Like a fix, but better.

297
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,480
What's wrong? Are you afraid?

298
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,040
Yes, I'm afraid.

299
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,680
I like it.

300
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,200
I'm coming.

301
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,560
Your coffee's horrible!

302
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,520
Horrible coffee, horrible coffee.

303
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,560
Could I have another cup? No?

304
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,960
You're the type to say no.

305
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,680
Do you need something from me?

306
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,080
Yeah, I wanted to know
if you've seen a witness

307
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,480
because apparently
there's one hiding here.

308
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,560
A witness?

309
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,120
Not a Jehovah's witness.

310
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,920
A murder witness. Double murder.

311
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,040
Who was killed?

312
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,760
Did it happen here?

313
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,360
Look! He's coming! How are you honey?

314
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,560
Do you have pigs? I like pigs.

315
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,680
It's not a farm here.

316
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,920
So, around 2:00 this morning,
did you hear a shot?

317
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,080
You weren't asleep?

318
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,120
-During the blackout?
-You had a blackout?

319
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,200
-Yes.
-That's men. When they drink.

320
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,680
No, during the blackout.

321
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,720
No, I just turned on the generator.

322
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,640
No, I would've heard a shot.

323
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,200
Sound travels far here.

324
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,920
I want to show you something...

325
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,640
I don't know where I found it...
There's a bit...

326
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,200
I often travel so I put everything
in my pockets.

327
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,720
There it is.

328
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,640
Are you familiar with this?

329
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,040
It's the weapon?

330
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,840
It could be, it's that ugly.

331
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,840
Whoever has this phone, my God,

332
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,480
if they're more than nine,
I'd put them in prison

333
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,560
-for bad taste.
-Good news. It's not mine.

334
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,240
You can leave me.

335
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,480
-You're good-natured, you know?
-Yes, I know.

336
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,480
Do you know anyone around here
who collects old guns?

337
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,960
I'm talking things
from the Second World War,

338
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,040
Mausers. Are you into that?

339
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,960
No, it's not my thing.

340
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,560
If I may, weapons are worse taste
than pink phones.

341
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,920
Not wrong.

342
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,760
I have candy, too.

343
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,960
You want one?

344
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,480
No, thanks.

345
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,720
Oh, shit.

346
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,360
-That's all we needed.
-Who's that?

347
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,240
-Michel Chalard.
-Ah, the owner.

348
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,880
Marleau?

349
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,040
Captain Marleau. Seeing as
we don't have the same salary,

350
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,000
can you at least speak correctly?

351
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,360
How are you?

352
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,760
Alsace is small. For lovers like us.

353
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,080
You know each other?

354
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,800
Not really, we just met.

355
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,200
But it'll last.

356
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,400
We haven't really met each other.

357
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,400
Michel Chalard,
I'm the owner of the property

358
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,800
where the drama was.

359
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,680
Aspiring mayor, too.

360
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:30,840
Sofa promotion?

361
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,960
I had a guard for surveillance.

362
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,200
That's who they killed.

363
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,800
Why do you say "they"?

364
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,840
How do you know there were several?
What do you know?

365
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,040
Did you see them?

366
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,440
There's a band of them.

367
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,000
They tagged my property walls,

368
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,040
defamed me on the internet.

369
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,720
I complained, but nothing happened.

370
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:54,080
-Do you know their name?
-No.

371
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,040
They're all anonymous.

372
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,400
A big Z as a signature.

373
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,440
And I'm the bad one.

374
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,520
Even though I'm trying
to bring life back to my home.

375
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,040
-He's good, Zorro.
-The Zorros,

376
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,560
maybe they're afraid
of new Robin Hoods?

377
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,920
Bad Robin Hoods

378
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,200
who apparently bring work
from Samsonite and Goodyear.

379
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,640
I think these kids

380
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:20,400
were walking on the hazelnut track,
got to your clearing,

381
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,760
and what did they see?

382
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,920
A non-declared construction site.

383
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,400
That's not Republican.

384
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,600
Is that the secret you wanted kept?

385
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,320
Yes, it's true, the authorizations
were slow.

386
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,920
I knew I'd have them,
so, I planned for it.

387
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,040
Like all the big men,
Angela Davis, Marie Curie, etc.

388
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,160
I don't know, this clearing's
always attracted psychos.

389
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,320
They came to do their things.

390
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,480
Now, kids come to smoke joints,

391
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,120
so, I got a guard,

392
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,160
Robert Perdriel, a brave man.

393
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,040
Did he smoke or carry joints?

394
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,400
Was he armed? No, I don't think so.

395
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,320
No...

396
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,160
I wanted to show you.
Do you know this phone?

397
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,400
Ah, speaking of phones... excuse me.

398
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,560
Yes... yes, you're going to hurt me?

399
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,960
It will be incredible.

400
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,080
Yes.

401
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,840
You don't seem to be friends
with Chalard.

402
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,400
It has nothing to do
with your investigation.

403
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,200
Well, you know...

404
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,760
Territorial lords can cross paths.

405
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,920
Just like your property
is penetrable.

406
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,360
Because it seems your guard
heard the dog barking last night.

407
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,880
So, I'm going to check amongst
the bears if there's an intruder.

408
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,360
If something happens to you,
it could come down on me.

409
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,560
I can defend myself.

410
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,720
-I don't need anyone.
-Ah, no?

411
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,960
Unless you have a search warrant?

412
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,760
Yes, I always have one on me.

413
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,680
Little bear!
Hello!

414
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,880
No, I think I left it at home.

415
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,360
Come back when you've found it.

416
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,000
OK. What time is it?

417
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,840
Hello! Auntie Marteau is here.

418
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,120
-9:58
-58?

419
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,920
Show me. They're precise,
these pocket watches.

420
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,360
My grandma had one.

421
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,080
We must have put it on the...
well, we don't care.

422
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,640
How much is the entry fee?

423
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,520
Five euros. It's on the sign.

424
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,120
Ah, really? I'm not sure if I have
that much on me. It's a lot.

425
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,920
Do you do discounts

426
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,680
for public servants,
part-time workers, etc.?

427
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,200
Because it might be hard.

428
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,840
Hey! What wouldn't we do
to come and see the beautiful bear?

429
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,600
Come on, come on.

430
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,760
OK, I'm off.

431
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,640
See you soon!

432
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,160
Hey! Mr. Chalard!

433
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,320
There are bears. We're off to see
the wolves. Are you coming?

434
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,000
OK, why not?

435
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,000
"Wooo" says the wolf!

436
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,360
So, if I understood,

437
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,360
it seems like you have a problem
with Ms. Dewaere?

438
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,200
The golf course? Yes,
it's not going well.

439
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,120
It's hardcore country mentality.

440
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,720
And Jeanne Dewaere
isn't very accommodating.

441
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,920
I noticed. What does she have to do
with the golf course?

442
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,800
Look at this house.

443
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,360
Ideal for a panoramic restaurant.

444
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,320
We could make the terrace bigger
and seat 80 people.

445
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,520
Yeah! I have an idea:
upstairs rooms for the golfers,

446
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,720
they can do 18 holes
and then after...

447
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,840
-You see what I mean?
-Ah, yes.

448
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:24,280
But, where does Jeanne put her tent?
Amongst the wolves?

449
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,920
I'll make her a loft room
in the attic.

450
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,760
She lives alone, you know?

451
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,480
-Think of the lost space.
-I am!

452
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,040
-She said no?
-Exactly.

453
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,800
-She's the type to say no.
-I respect her.

454
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,120
-But she has a character...
-Yes, how could we say it?

455
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,600
She's difficult.

456
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,560
Poor people don't know
what's good for them.

457
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,520
Luckily, there are people like you
to do the thinking.

458
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,680
-Captain!
-What?

459
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,800
Sorry, Mr. Chalard, I must go.

460
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,400
Don't hesitate to get in touch.

461
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,200
I feel guilty for the guard.

462
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,600
Guilty? How guilty?

463
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,800
You killed him?

464
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,960
I'm joking, Mr. Chalard!

465
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,400
-So?
-The butt is at the lab,

466
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,440
the cartridge, too.
For the piece of material,

467
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,160
forensics was right--
it's from Zorro's cape.

468
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,880
Otherwise, the guard,
Robert Perdriel, lived alone.

469
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:21,840
He didn't want

470
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,840
a weapon. He said that if he had one,
he wouldn't use it.

471
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,080
-Not wrong.
-That's it.

472
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,520
And the cartridge, for the moment,

473
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,240
has nothing to do with our case,
but maybe...

474
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,360
-well, we don't know.
-I don't understand what you said.

475
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,800
I'm going for a run, to clear
my head, because you...

476
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,280
I wasn't clear there...

477
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,360
Yeah, yeah, keep going!
You can do it!

478
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,240
Yeah! Yeah!

479
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,720
Oh, hello!

480
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,520
Look, I'm a redhead, too.
Look. I'm a ginger.

481
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,280
Give me a kiss.

482
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,840
You don't want to give me a kiss?

483
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,600
OK, I'm off, then.

484
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,640
Hello, Michel! It's nice to see you.

485
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,800
-How are you, Gabriel?
-Good.

486
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,800
A bit shaken, like everyone.

487
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,560
-It must be hard for you.
-You can say that again.

488
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,560
It's bad timing, with the elections.

489
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,760
Yeah. It's not a good memory.

490
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,600
What was the old guard's name?

491
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,960
Arthur Lerois.

492
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,160
He died in the same place.

493
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,800
Except that it was
a real murder.

494
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,680
He would have been 45.

495
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,960
It's strange to grow old.

496
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,440
While the dead, they stay
forever young.

497
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,600
Do you know anything?

498
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:01,880
As I always say, the best-informed
man in Entzheim is Gabriel.

499
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,960
You know me. I don't like confusion.

500
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,680
But I don't know if I should say

501
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,080
that I found a strange mess
in the boss's trash.

502
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,480
That's interesting.

503
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,240
And that's not counting
the dog barking at 3:30 a.m.

504
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:15,960
Here.

505
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,280
I found this.

506
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,480
Hello, little dogs.

507
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,880
Brière.

508
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,880
No, she's not far. Yes.

509
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,640
Ah, yes, OK. Great.

510
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,480
Thanks a lot. OK, I'll go right away.

511
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,160
It isn't like the boss
to have a pink telephone.

512
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:12,800
And you saw that it's not possible
to intrude into the park.

513
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,720
Virgile reacts immediately.

514
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,720
-Even from afar.
-Yeah?

515
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,200
Well, apparently he was barking.

516
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,440
Virgile? No, definitely not.

517
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,560
-I would have heard him.
-Ah, OK.

518
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,000
How do you like Ms. Dewaere ?

519
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,960
A bit? A lot? Like crazy?

520
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,160
I owe her everything.

521
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,600
Do you know many

522
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,200
women who hire ex-inmates
with no questions?

523
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,480
Not really. It's not typical.

524
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,920
That rhymes with trustworthy.

525
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,280
Trustworthy to the point of lying
to cops, for example.

526
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,680
Are there many ex-inmates ready
to do that?

527
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:46,800
To cover her?

528
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,680
Yeah, she helps anyone she can.

529
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,600
I'll say something:

530
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,600
when she took over the animal park,

531
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,240
Arthur Lerois, the guard,

532
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,440
he'd done six months for bodily harm.

533
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,560
Everyone advised her to fire him.

534
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,920
Interesting.

535
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,560
Captain.

536
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,760
We identified the victim.
It's Léonard Vincenne.

537
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,600
A student on vacation
with his friend Julien Redon.

538
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,560
The address is St.-George-les-Mines.

539
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,240
OK. And the cartridge?

540
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,440
It's from a Mauser 43.

541
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,840
It was shot recently and look, here.

542
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,920
A license for a Mauser.

543
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,040
Jean-Marie Chalard.
Isn't that the father of...

544
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,160
-of Michel?
-Yeah.

545
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,080
-Where's my parka?
-Back there.

546
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,320
Let's go and get it.

547
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,640
Did you hear that?

548
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,200
The Mauser was Chalard's.

549
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,920
So, he killed the guard.

550
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:46,000
I'm not surprised.
There's something about him.

551
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,600
No, you're not right.

552
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,560
Me and Chalard grew up together.

553
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,280
He wouldn't touch a fly.

554
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,440
You're naive, Gabriel.

555
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,000
You always see the good.

556
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,760
There's my parka.

557
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,320
-Why did you forget it there?
-Sorry...

558
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,280
Calm down. Look at it.
There's candy inside.

559
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,840
OK, let's go.

560
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,480
Go in front if it's dangerous.
There are wolves!

561
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,040
Our last selfie with Léonard.

562
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,680
Good reason to get rid of it.

563
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,000
You don't realize.

564
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,160
A firearm, a murder.
That's not what you told me.

565
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,240
Ah, yes, the rifle shot.

566
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,440
-I'd forgotten.
-How did you forget?

567
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,720
Look at me. Answer me honestly.

568
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,600
Do you know something
about the guard's death?

569
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,520
Jeanne, I didn't even know
he was there!

570
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,200
And Julien, he disappeared?

571
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,960
I don't know. I have no news.

572
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,240
Hold on.

573
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,520
The police can't come to you.

574
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,200
They can't prove anything.

575
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,480
Now, you're going back to work.
Like normal.

576
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,760
No, I can't, Jeanne!

577
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,520
Of course you can!

578
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,120
You're hard on me.

579
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,280
Yeah, I'm hard.

580
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,600
That's why I take risks
to save your skin!

581
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,920
Little idiot!

582
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,160
No, Jeanne, wait.

583
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,000
Sorry.

584
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,480
I didn't want to say that. I'm sorry.

585
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,960
That's Julien Redon's house.

586
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,440
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, pretty sure.

587
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,640
What's going on?

588
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,840
It's a police squad.

589
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,080
Where do they think they are?

590
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,520
Goddamn special forces.

591
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,880
The crazier we get,
the more we laugh,

592
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,720
-but not sure we have the same humor.
-No, that's true.

593
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,720
Comrades. So, what's going on?

594
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,880
Julien Redon has been
on the watchlist a while.

595
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:03,520
The Interior Ministry saw
his texts online. Calls for uprising.

596
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,800
So, we're taking over
the investigation.

597
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,600
Procurer's orders.
It's come from the top.

598
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,400
Well, if it's from the top...

599
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,080
Is that Julien Redon ?

600
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,200
Yes.

601
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,920
He confessed to the murder.

602
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,960
He said it was accidental.

603
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,760
He says that he and Léonard
wanted to mock Michel Chalard.

604
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,160
They wanted to attach
a banner to the trees.

605
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,040
"To mock"? You police talk funny.

606
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,760
Did Redon say there were three?

607
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,520
No, there were just two.
Him and Vincenne.

608
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,560
Sorry, Captain, we have work to do.

609
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,560
Ah, yes, and we don't?

610
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,960
This is ridiculous.

611
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,040
If they're terrorists,
I'm the Dalai Lama.

612
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,640
We're not going
to leave them, Captain?

613
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,240
Let's keep going. We're on a roll.

614
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,080
You just have to give them that.
It'll give them something to do.

615
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,240
Are you joking? I found that.

616
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,720
No, I won't.
We're not giving them that.

617
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,920
Ah... concealment of proof...

618
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,440
Do you want to enlist
in the Red Brigade?

619
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,640
Anarchist!

620
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,800
No, I'm joking. Look, did you see?

621
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,240
When you left my parka,

622
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,600
someone stole the phone.

623
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,120
Nothing inside, no sim card.

624
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,800
You're joking!

625
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,840
I don't think I'm made
for this job. Dad was right.

626
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,560
Your dad's a fool.

627
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,520
Thanks to you, we're close.

628
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,880
If we find who stole the sim card,

629
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,680
we know who wants
to cover up the case.

630
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,600
You understand? Here.

631
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,720
What are you doing?

632
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,840
Finally alone.

633
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,240
I thought you'd appreciate
my discretion.

634
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,240
Let me tell you,
you're in trouble, Jeanne.

635
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,480
Impeding a terrorist
investigation case

636
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,680
is bad.

637
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,640
What?

638
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,520
-Your protégée is at risk.
-Who?

639
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,360
Manon. The little delinquent.

640
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,400
It's maybe not my place,

641
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,960
but you have a bad taste for thugs.

642
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,440
Like Jean-Claude, the drug addict.

643
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,680
-Ex.
-Ah, ex-drug addict.

644
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,640
Or Arthur, the ex-guard.

645
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,000
A real riffraff, that guy.

646
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,640
Six months for bodily harm.

647
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:28,120
Arthur was the most adorable
person I met.

648
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,080
He was attacked.

649
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,960
But the police didn't listen.

650
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,600
In any case, this attraction
to criminals...

651
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,480
Have you thought of psychoanalysis?

652
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,200
What do you want?

653
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,080
Still the same thing.

654
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,280
Our agreement for the golf course.

655
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,120
Get out of here.

656
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,640
I know you're doing it to win votes.

657
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,480
I have proof that Manon was involved,

658
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:01,520
and that you've hidden the suspect
of a double terrorist act.

659
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,240
I'm nice. I've said nothing...
until now.

660
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,640
Look. My new project.

661
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,080
It's a win-win situation.

662
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,000
Congratulations.

663
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,280
I'm convinced now not to sign.

664
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
It's not a proposition,
it's blackmail.

665
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,480
Ah... I understand.
You think I'm bluffing.

666
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,800
-Hello?
-Captain Marleau?

667
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,880
It's Michel Chalard. I just realized
I have a document

668
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,600
that could help you.

669
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:41,160
-Send it to Brière.
-No, I want to give it to you.

670
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,240
-Where can we meet?
-My place, at 3:00 p.m.

671
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,160
Perfect.

672
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,600
You have until 3:00 p.m to sign.

673
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,640
The judge has let us continue.

674
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,120
You really want to look
for the sim card?

675
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,480
It's worth a shot.

676
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,960
Because, you see, Jeanne Dewaere

677
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,240
was in a perfect position
to search through my parka.

678
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,560
I don't like people going through
my things without asking.

679
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,840
-So, what do we do?
-What do we do...

680
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,040
Let's look through her file...
her judicial file.

681
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:22,120
Because going through a cop's things
is the work of a pro.

682
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,240
An innocent person wouldn't do that.

683
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,560
It's clear, Jeanne Dewaere sent
the little Zorros there.

684
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,080
Do you understand me?

685
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,800
I was afraid you'd be closed.

686
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,800
I would like some prickly flowers.

687
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Flowers like whips.

688
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,120
-Are you seeing him?
-Yes.

689
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,360
I don't know how you do it.

690
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,080
With his boorish charm,

691
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,760
he's so sexy!

692
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,400
ENTZHEIM TOWN HALL

693
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,800
So?

694
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,520
I'm gonna break that Chalard's jaw

695
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,120
and then denounce him.

696
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,800
-And Manon?
-And you?

697
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,320
Do you realize what you did?

698
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,520
I helped a girl in need.

699
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,360
And you stole from a cop.
Do you know the consequences?

700
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,920
For a girl who is exploiting you.

701
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,120
Like for all of them who abuse you.

702
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,800
You've never said that before.

703
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:33,840
You think that?

704
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,320
I think that Manon
should tell the police.

705
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,400
It wouldn't hurt her
to tell the truth.

706
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,200
-And you stay out of it.
-It's a big risk.

707
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,120
She needs to take responsibility.

708
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,920
It was her own fault.

709
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,640
Her life will be finished!

710
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,400
We're all confused at 20!

711
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,520
She's an adult.
She must be responsible.

712
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,680
Responsible?

713
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,000
Do you realize what you're saying?

714
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,200
Complicity to murder,
that's ten years.

715
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,320
And you don't just lose freedom.

716
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,000
It's your dignity too!

717
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,560
Your joy for life.

718
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,280
You always speak about that.

719
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,360
And then there's the boredom.

720
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,840
Boredom which gnaws away at you.

721
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,360
That's what prison means.

722
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,560
Can you imagine her inside?

723
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:18,400
No. I can't.

724
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,040
And you?

725
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,840
Thanks to you, I know what to do.

726
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,520
Patrick, it's Alain.

727
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,480
I need some confidential info
on someone I know.

728
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,120
Jeanne Dewaere.

729
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,400
NO TO THE GOLF COURSE

730
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:23,520
Yeah.

731
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:28,000
Are you sure it's not
another Jeanne Dewaere?

732
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,720
Are you sure?

733
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,120
Goddamnit!

734
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,960
Mr. Chalard!

735
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,240
It's me, it's Véronique.

736
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,360
Mr. Chalard?

737
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,440
Mr. Chalard?

738
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,000
I can't believe it.
Léonard was really nice.

739
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,560
Always a nice thing to say, helpful,

740
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,840
all of them, Julien, Raoul, Frédéric.

741
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,000
And the little florist. Manon.

742
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,280
They love having a laugh, a drink.

743
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,960
They did well in their village
with the shop.

744
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,840
-There's things happening.
-Yeah.

745
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,120
Dangerous terrorists, what a joke.

746
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,920
It creates links. Shops are good.

747
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,280
Do you know Jeanne Dewaere?

748
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,840
Reserved, discrete, but nice.

749
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,000
She looks after troubled kids.

750
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,000
She finds them work, a place to stay.

751
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,280
Ah, I know the story.
Ms. I-know-how-to-do-things-best.

752
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,840
OK, I'll prepare you a nice lunch.

753
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,800
It will rejuvenate you.

754
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,720
-Thank you!
-Captain!

755
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:04,960
Oh, yeah?

756
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:06,440
You were right.

757
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,720
I know, I'm always right.
It's my job.

758
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,560
Jeanne Dewaere, formerly Ferrari,

759
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:14,000
married Marco Ferrari
20 years ago, a real scoundrel.

760
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,280
She was busted robbing a post office.

761
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,280
One cop died, Marco, too.
Sentenced to 12 years,

762
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:21,640
released after eight.
Look.

763
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,920
Trial...
Ah, yes, Dewaere,

764
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,360
that's why we missed it.

765
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,440
"Robbery reaches its end."

766
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,680
Well done! Let me buy you lunch.

767
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,120
He's completely crazy.

768
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,160
You know where your gloves were?

769
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:53,880
In the greenhouse!

770
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:57,080
Even a few seeds
can stuff everything up!

771
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,720
What do I tell the lab?

772
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,680
Due to someone who can't read,
we kill the wolves?

773
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,520
Do you realize?

774
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,160
You again.

775
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,600
You're beautiful angry.

776
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,000
But less than in photos.

777
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:14,800
Let's go.

778
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,840
After you, dear friend.

779
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:18,680
Sir.

780
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:26,400
What are you hoping for?
A signed confession?

781
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,440
"I, Jeanne Dewaere,
am guilty of a murder."

782
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,360
That would do nicely.

783
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,160
You're such a cop.

784
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:34,840
You don't want people to live.

785
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:38,080
Only an ex-con would say clichés
like that.

786
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,880
All the cops I've met want one thing:

787
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,000
us to mess up again.

788
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,840
Well, not untrue.

789
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,720
But as Super Didier said:

790
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,880
"Crooks are like cops--
some are good."

791
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,000
And I believe what I see.

792
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,440
Yet, you're here.

793
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,320
You know my file,
so, you judge me as guilty.

794
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:57,840
Whoa, your case
isn't the case of the century.

795
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:58,880
Calm down.

796
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,520
So, tell me, calmly, nicely,

797
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,560
that you stole a sim card,

798
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,120
and we'll make a deal.

799
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,160
-A stolen sim card?
-Yeah.

800
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,000
A sim card.

801
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,000
Do you have proof?

802
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,240
Not on me, but I'll find it.

803
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,600
When you find it,
come back to see me. OK?

804
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,040
You really are a pig!

805
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,040
I adore girls like you,
but you need to stop screwing around.

806
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,520
Let me remind you
that we have two deaths.

807
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:27,600
Including a kid.

808
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,800
The second has been arrested
and the third is on the run.

809
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:31,600
So, help me.

810
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,960
They're disadvantaged,
not terrorists. They'll do time!

811
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,400
If you want to help them,
you have to speak.

812
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,720
You need to speak now.
Do you understand?

813
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,600
Sorry, I have a call.

814
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,240
-What Brière?
-Captain

815
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,440
Enunciate, I don't understand.

816
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,520
He's dead.

817
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,600
OK, I'm coming.

818
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,000
What is that?

819
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,760
No to the golf course!

820
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,880
Down with exploitation
in the U.A.E.!

821
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:21,320
Comrades.

822
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,000
Captain, come quick.

823
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,000
-Hi, losers.
-Hello, Captain.

824
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,400
Well, well, well.

825
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,600
Chalard doesn't get bored.

826
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,160
A pool.

827
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:38,320
He brought that back
from the Caymans.

828
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,040
What's that?

829
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,880
What is it?

830
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,440
-Where's the cadaver?
-Upstairs.

831
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,040
Is that from the art show?

832
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,680
Looks like Matthew Barney.

833
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,720
Go on, he won't eat you.

834
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,600
Come on!

835
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:14,200
Well...

836
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:17,680
Nice eclipse.

837
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,280
Hello, honey.

838
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:22,760
What's that?

839
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:29,440
Manon, artisanal florist.

840
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,680
Chalard...

841
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,000
What's this?

842
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,480
Mushrooms.

843
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,040
Wow.

844
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,320
Wait for me.

845
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,880
-Captain.
-I'm here.

846
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,320
Stop doing that. It annoys me.

847
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,760
You look like you were
the teacher's pet.

848
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:08,760
The world doesn't belong
to those with veto power,

849
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,720
-but to those who disobey.
-That's libertarian,

850
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,400
-for a cop.
-A lady cop.

851
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,600
Got to break rules. What is it?

852
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,200
The murder witness is here.

853
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,560
Why didn't you say?

854
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,160
Oh, my God!
Is he really dead?

855
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,760
Very observant. Who are you?

856
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,040
His lady.

857
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:37,000
What does that mean in local lingo?

858
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:40,760
-I kept his house in order.
-That doesn't mean anything.

859
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:44,040
-Did you find him like that?
-Yes.

860
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,320
I tried to call, but nothing.

861
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:47,840
Nothing.

862
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,720
That's because he was dead.

863
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:53,200
He was never away from his phone.

864
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,600
The killer must have it.

865
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:55,600
The killer?

866
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:59,080
Who spoke of a murder?
It's funny you speak like that.

867
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,920
His success caused jealousy.

868
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:04,000
And the garters and fishnets,

869
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,480
was that routine
or just for big occasions?

870
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,200
It never happened.

871
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:11,160
Otherwise, I wouldn't have stayed.

872
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,720
I have something of interest.

873
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:14,880
What?

874
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,600
We're in a full red moon.

875
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,600
You want my stylist's number?

876
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,440
The red moon is the night
of the big reveal.

877
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,080
The truth exposed.

878
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,360
Exactly. The red moon is at Easter.

879
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,160
Three bodies in 24 hours.
You talk about the truth.

880
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,040
Captain?

881
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,040
What is it?

882
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,160
Look what I found
on the social networks.

883
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,280
The pink bunny phone.

884
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,600
It's Manon Bechet's phone,
the florist.

885
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,160
Doesn't it seem like a coincidence?

886
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:45,280
Absolutely. So, first link:
the flowers.

887
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:48,760
Because the flowers were bought
in Manon's shop.

888
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,320
You know what?

889
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,440
She's part of the cards club.

890
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,760
I loved playing cards
when I was young.

891
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,480
I'll leave you then.

892
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:57,640
Goodbye, ma'am.

893
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:02,160
-I'm going to clean up .
-No, this is a crime scene.

894
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:03,480
Don't touch anything.

895
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:15,600
Yes, Captain?

896
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,160
Oscar, it's Marleau.
What did you find?

897
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,880
At first glance, it looked like

898
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:25,040
an erotic game gone bad

899
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,080
or suicide with a macabre scene,

900
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:31,280
but given the skin's texture,

901
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,760
it looks more like poisoning.

902
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:34,640
Really?

903
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,080
Maybe cyanide,

904
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,160
but if there's atropine action,

905
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,880
it's probably digitalis.

906
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,000
And so?

907
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,320
The signs are contradictory.

908
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:47,360
Yes, and so?

909
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:50,600
I need to ask another colleague.

910
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,040
Wait, I know someone.

911
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,160
Ah, yes. It's the Snowden of poisons.

912
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:58,240
The Ricky Gervais
of intestinal lamella.

913
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,600
-Great.
-I'll call him.

914
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:07,480
Pool...

915
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,360
Pool, pool,
who is the most beautiful cop?

916
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:13,760
Not me.

917
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,760
CRIMINAL RECORD MANON BECHET.

918
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,800
Are you Manon Bechet ?

919
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,960
National Police,
Captain Marleau.

920
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:52,600
Bechet... aren't you from Australia?
From Sydney? No?

921
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,480
I've got a frog catcher.

922
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:57,320
Just wait five minutes.

923
00:53:58,480 --> 00:53:59,520
It's ringing.

924
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:03,160
No.

925
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:05,960
I read your file.

926
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,520
You stole bottles of alcohol.

927
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,480
We've all done that. It's no biggie.

928
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,320
But I did notice one thing.

929
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,680
You sold drugs to someone
from the police drug brigade.

930
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:21,480
And the court gave you
mitigating circumstances

931
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:22,800
for your stupidity?

932
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,480
Did you come to mock me?

933
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,800
We're not well paid.
We need to laugh.

934
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,760
Otherwise, I also saw

935
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,600
Ms. Dewaere is your reference.

936
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:35,600
Does she know
about your pink bunny phone?

937
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,040
Speaking of pink,

938
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:44,160
did someone come
to buy some roses this morning?

939
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,240
Who?

940
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:46,760
Red roses?

941
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,080
23, I counted them.

942
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,960
Émilie Guingamp, the hairdresser.

943
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:55,240
-Chalard's mistress?
-Mistress?

944
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,400
I don't know
what you're talking about.

945
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:01,200
All I can say is that Émilie
is a nice girl.

946
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:03,920
Nice isn't a job.

947
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,080
Brière, it's Marleau.

948
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,640
Can you search

949
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:12,800
for a nice hairdresser,
Émilie Guingamp?

950
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,360
Like the train station.

951
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:18,320
In exchange, I'll bring you
a nice florist.

952
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,320
Yeah.

953
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:21,760
We'll put her in custody.

954
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,240
Carpentier!

955
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:26,840
Can you put the girl in custody,
please?

956
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,760
-Do you have the T.V. programs?
-No, Captain.

957
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,320
-What are you doing?
-I was waiting for you.

958
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:44,600
Come and look. The newspaper
published a photo of Chalard.

959
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,080
I got you a copy.

960
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:50,080
Where did they get that,
the scavengers?

961
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,840
I don't know. I called,
but there was no response.

962
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:56,320
Look at this.
I went through Chalard's accounts.

963
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,680
Look what I found.

964
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,320
I don't understand. What is it?

965
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:04,480
Michel Chalard bet
on high-risk loans.

966
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:05,240
Yeah...

967
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,480
Look, he also bet on the conditions
of a partnership,

968
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:11,640
particularly on Ms. Dewaere's
animal park.

969
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,760
He was desperate for money.

970
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:16,760
Strange to kill a desperate man.

971
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:19,120
-Usually, it's the opposite.
-True.

972
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:23,200
He was also the owner
of Manon Bechet's florist.

973
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,760
He wanted to turn it into
a golf shop.

974
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:28,840
He even took her to court
to expel her.

975
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:32,200
I don't think Manon Bechet
liked Monsieur Chalard,

976
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:33,200
in my opinion.

977
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,920
Good work, my boy.

978
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,200
Go and get yourself a reward.

979
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,080
-Mr. Gabriel?
-Yes, I'm here.

980
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:07,000
Look what I found out the front.

981
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,360
Do you know much about mushrooms?

982
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:14,360
Me? Well, without boasting,
I'm the king of mushrooms.

983
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:17,280
Mushrooms are easy.
There are only two categories:

984
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,520
basidiomycetes and ascomycetes.

985
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:23,040
Did you give any to Michel Chalard,
by chance?

986
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,200
Yes, yesterday. Why?

987
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:27,200
Do you know how many?

988
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,920
Of course, there are some here.

989
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,520
Go for it. They're yesterday's.
Smell that.

990
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:36,200
Ah, gross.

991
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,480
I don't like mushrooms.
I prefer music.

992
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:42,720
I'm going to put something together

993
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:45,760
for fans of "moderato cantabile."

994
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,360
I'm have a pass
to Barbès National Orchestra,

995
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,640
but it's not working.

996
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,200
And I'm never wrong.

997
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:54,760
Why do you ask?

998
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:57,560
Because Michel Chalard
didn't die by hanging.

999
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,120
Oh?

1000
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:00,920
Are you sure?

1001
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:03,200
On my mother's life...

1002
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,360
who is dead.

1003
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:12,960
Hello!

1004
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:15,920
Guess why I'm here.

1005
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:19,400
-No idea.
-At least guess.

1006
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,000
You have to play to win.

1007
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,680
-Come on!
-I don't want to guess.

1008
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:25,200
Oh, come on!

1009
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:27,760
I'm not in a joking mood today. OK?

1010
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,960
You're no fun.

1011
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:31,280
Look at this.

1012
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:36,080
I know your methods.

1013
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,200
You want me to react? It won't work.

1014
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,800
Well, no reaction is a reaction.

1015
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,200
My methods aren't so stupid,
you know.

1016
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,080
Do you want my real opinion?

1017
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:48,360
I didn't like him.

1018
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,480
I won't pretend to be sad.

1019
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,560
-Not even a little tear?
-No.

1020
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,280
He didn't even deserve hate.

1021
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,680
You think my sadness...

1022
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,680
What you said was beautiful. Poetic.

1023
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,000
Can I help you to feed them?

1024
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,440
No? I'll wait, then.

1025
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:07,880
We'll talk after.

1026
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:11,120
Your little protégée is in custody.

1027
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:21,480
Did you know about Chalard?

1028
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:24,520
He was going to throw Manon
out of her shop.

1029
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:26,560
-He was a bastard.
-There we go.

1030
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,840
Finally, a swear word.

1031
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:31,240
You keep animal fur.

1032
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,640
Manon is a brave girl.

1033
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:36,400
I helped her get on her feet.

1034
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:38,480
But she's still fragile.

1035
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:41,160
Chalard would have finished her.

1036
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:42,560
So, to save her,

1037
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:44,960
you're prepared to steal sim cards?

1038
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,440
That's more than dedication.
That's devotion.

1039
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,400
It would have sent her over the edge.

1040
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:51,720
I wanted to help.

1041
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:54,720
How much?
To the point of killing Chalard?

1042
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:58,440
Because...
you'll say it's a coincidence,

1043
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,240
but just before dying, he told me:

1044
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,560
"I have some revelations
about Ms. Dewaere."

1045
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:04,480
Funny, no?

1046
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:07,640
If you think I'm guilty,

1047
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,280
just lock me up.

1048
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,480
-Do you have a lawyer?
-Yes.

1049
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,400
But he's not much fun.

1050
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,080
I'll say nothing.

1051
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,200
Like most of them.

1052
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:21,000
Sorry, I have a call. Who's calling?

1053
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:22,880
Yeah?

1054
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:24,800
OK?

1055
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:26,360
OK, cool.

1056
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:27,400
See you soon.

1057
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:30,000
Sorry, I have to go,

1058
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:33,760
because your protégée
is less stubborn than you.

1059
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,960
She's decided to speak. Great, right?

1060
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:38,240
I swear, Manon isn't involved
in his death.

1061
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,520
I swear.

1062
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:41,360
We'll see... Inshallah.

1063
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:42,960
I have a plus in my job:

1064
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:45,920
I come across as so stupid
that people feel sorry for me,

1065
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:47,960
they end up accusing each other.

1066
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,240
Cool, right? Well, see you soon.

1067
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:55,680
You know you're lucky
to be in custody with me?

1068
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:57,000
One: I have no man,

1069
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:59,480
two: I have no woman or children

1070
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,280
and I don't have gastro.

1071
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:04,320
So, I have all the time in the world.

1072
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:05,520
I'm listening.

1073
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:09,120
Why were you at Chalard's
the other night?

1074
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:11,600
We wanted to protest his golf course.

1075
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,000
We went with a banner.

1076
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:14,880
Dressed as Zorro.

1077
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:18,040
-We thought it was funny.
-Yeah.

1078
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:20,600
Except someone was waiting
when you arrived.

1079
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:22,520
There was a shot.

1080
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:25,800
Yes, I know, from the guard,
with Chalard's Mauser,

1081
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:28,000
which he'd lent him. OK, then?

1082
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:30,360
Then, I ran off.

1083
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,200
I went to Jeanne and she helped me.

1084
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:35,960
And that's all.

1085
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:37,840
That's all I know.

1086
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:40,360
I hope for your case

1087
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:43,400
that Chalard's mistress
didn't see you at his house.

1088
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:46,160
-Why?
-Why? Because, one:

1089
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:49,760
around his body was a bouquet
from your florist.

1090
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:51,080
OK?

1091
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:54,800
Two: you have a motive,

1092
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:56,360
because your friend's dead.

1093
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:01,040
And three: you have
a criminal record, my girl.

1094
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:02,680
So, either you killed him,

1095
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:05,040
or you have a very good alibi.

1096
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,560
See what I'm saying?

1097
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:15,240
Well?

1098
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,440
-Is Chalard's mistress there?
-No.

1099
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,360
I don't know why, at this time.

1100
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:20,720
Her car's there.

1101
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:22,600
We might find something.

1102
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:23,720
Ah, yeah.

1103
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:28,840
You're right! You're not so stupid.

1104
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,040
Thanks.

1105
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,320
Powerful car.

1106
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:35,480
Let's have a look, then...

1107
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:38,840
If I call Chalard, what will happen?

1108
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:42,800
Voila...

1109
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,800
There we go.

1110
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:49,760
Is that Chalard's phone?

1111
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,920
Yeah. It's like a frog Kama Sutra.

1112
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:53,920
-Is it her?
-Yeah.

1113
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,960
A crime of passion, then?

1114
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:57,840
What's wrong? You seem upset.

1115
01:02:59,080 --> 01:02:59,720
A bit, yeah.

1116
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:01,960
Murderers are like that.

1117
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:04,520
Crimes are often completely stupid,

1118
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:07,040
stupid phones...

1119
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:09,320
I'll say this: murderers are often

1120
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:11,080
are stupider than you think.

1121
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:13,600
Hello!

1122
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:15,920
Ms. Guingamp!

1123
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,600
-My God, it's ugly.
-Yeah.

1124
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:21,000
-Shall we go up?
-Yeah.

1125
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:25,400
Ms. Guingamp?

1126
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,080
Ms. Guingamp?

1127
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,320
Remorse? Suicide?

1128
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:38,520
No, she's asleep.
Go and make her a coffee.

1129
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:41,360
Stop looking!

1130
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:45,320
Make a strong coffee,
black with salt, so she vomits.

1131
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:47,960
What's this? What a joke.

1132
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:50,040
Not very practical.

1133
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:52,520
Oh... earrings.

1134
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,560
Chalard didn't want those on.

1135
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:59,760
Ali Baba's cave.

1136
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:01,720
Strange hairbrush.

1137
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:06,000
Ah! Bunny ears.

1138
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,560
Come on, honey.

1139
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:12,080
Up you get!

1140
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,680
Ms. Boulier, it's nice to see you.

1141
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:19,600
Thanks for coming. Here.

1142
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,280
See you soon?

1143
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,200
Hello, ladies. How are you?

1144
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:26,560
Everything going well?

1145
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:28,320
Have a good day.
Thanks.

1146
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:30,920
Hello.

1147
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:33,760
What's this?

1148
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:35,960
Can I count on you?

1149
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:38,000
-Thanks, Mr. Mayor.
-Thanks, goodbye.

1150
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:39,360
Goodbye.

1151
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,120
Why aren't you picking up?

1152
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:43,360
I followed you yesterday.

1153
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:44,720
Hello, ma'am.

1154
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:46,640
How are you? Have a good day.

1155
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,240
I saw you go to his house.

1156
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:51,120
-Do you think I killed him?
-You tell me.

1157
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:53,520
-Hello, Mr. Mayor.
-Hello, ma'am.

1158
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:56,080
-I'm awaiting your answer.
-Come to my office.

1159
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:56,880
Goodbye.

1160
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:59,040
You hated him for the golf course.

1161
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,280
You go to his house, soon after
he's dead.

1162
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,240
What should I think?

1163
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:05,480
Do you think I killed him?

1164
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:07,360
You never answer my questions.

1165
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:09,720
Because you don't want to know.

1166
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,920
-You don't like women with no past.
-You're wrong.

1167
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:16,880
I searched your past
and wasn't disappointed.

1168
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:18,840
Jeanne Ferrari. 12 years.

1169
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:20,240
Eight.

1170
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:24,120
An ex-inmate.

1171
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:27,160
You don't hesitate
to throw away anyone with history.

1172
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:29,280
If you want to turn me in,

1173
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:31,080
don't worry, they already know.

1174
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:34,440
Why didn't you say?

1175
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:36,280
To avoid a reaction.

1176
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,240
It looks like you don't know me.

1177
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:40,000
Same for me.

1178
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:41,800
I don't recognize you.

1179
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:45,600
Your father and I crossed you off.

1180
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:48,520
You're no longer our girl.

1181
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:53,120
Who's this man in a suit
shaking people's hands?

1182
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:55,760
Distributing flyers
to win the election?

1183
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:57,840
I don't know him.

1184
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,760
Come on, come on!

1185
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:05,680
It was fun.

1186
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:09,760
He read that strangling
helps the orgasm.

1187
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,520
So, he wanted to try.

1188
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:15,240
Sex makes you lose your head,
you know?

1189
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:18,880
Well, you've lost your head
to the point of forgetting

1190
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:20,400
Chalard's telephone.

1191
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,000
We filmed each other.

1192
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:24,840
I didn't want the sex-tape
to be seen.

1193
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:27,280
I know some use that to get famous,

1194
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:28,680
but I don't need that.

1195
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:31,440
-The hairdressing's going well.
-I can see that.

1196
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:35,680
So, he died before your eyes.

1197
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:38,560
Yes.

1198
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:42,400
I did the knot,

1199
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:43,720
tightened it a bit,

1200
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,880
then, he started coughing

1201
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:51,960
and feeling unwell. So, I undid it.

1202
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,280
But it got worse and worse. I tried

1203
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:58,440
to undo the rope,
but it was strangling him.

1204
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:02,160
I swear that's the truth.
I'd never hurt him.

1205
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,280
But I was so scared...

1206
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,040
I left straight away

1207
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:08,760
and I took two pills.

1208
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:10,600
I told myself to sleep on it.

1209
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:14,160
I was going to come and see you.

1210
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:17,680
I swear...
I was so scared.

1211
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:18,960
I understand.

1212
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:22,400
There's something not right
there, in your video,

1213
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:24,880
which is short but trashy.

1214
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:27,280
The casting is really good,

1215
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:28,960
but the story's dated,

1216
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:32,200
it's basic. Regarding the timing,

1217
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:34,600
you need a new script, look...

1218
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:37,320
He has no bottoms.

1219
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:39,200
-Bottoms?
-Yeah,

1220
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:43,480
that you put on the bottom
or the top, depending who you are.

1221
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:45,120
Look, in this newspaper.

1222
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:47,480
Far from suggesting
the media lies to us...

1223
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:50,920
Look here, he's wearing bottoms

1224
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:52,840
and lipstick.

1225
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,640
While in the film, he isn't.
How is that?

1226
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:57,200
Ask Jeanne Dewaere.

1227
01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:00,320
Why? Is she a funeral director?

1228
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:01,840
She killed him.

1229
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:05,800
When I arrived, Michel was so happy,
he said he had her.

1230
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,480
That she had no choice but to accept.

1231
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,880
-Calm down, ma'am!
-You're kidding!

1232
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:14,680
I demand to see Captain Marleau.
I have a confession.

1233
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,960
OK, guys, I'll take care of this.

1234
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:19,000
How can I help you?

1235
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:20,960
I can't let an innocent person
be accused.

1236
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:22,840
I killed Michel Chalard.

1237
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:24,480
The love of my life.

1238
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:26,560
OK, I'm not a shrink. Sit down.

1239
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:28,720
This will save you 50 euros.

1240
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,160
I'm listening. What is it?

1241
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:34,120
I'd had enough
of his debauched ways.

1242
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:37,120
So, I poisoned his tea.

1243
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:41,320
A dose strong enough for him to fall
asleep in her arms, rather than...

1244
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:45,520
-Well, you understand.
-No.

1245
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:48,400
I didn't want him to die.

1246
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,920
I couldn't have known
it was dangerous.

1247
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:53,880
Lord...

1248
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:55,960
OK, Brière, you can let
Manon Bechet go.

1249
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:58,080
-And the police squad?
-We don't care.

1250
01:08:58,240 --> 01:08:59,880
They won't care about a banner.

1251
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:02,040
We don't put our noses
in their business.

1252
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:03,040
And I like Zorro.

1253
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:06,200
So, go and do the deed
my little munchkin.

1254
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:08,280
As for you...
Into custody.

1255
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:11,000
Rest and relaxation.

1256
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:14,080
For a long time.

1257
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:25,440
I was maybe the only one,
but I loved Michel Chalard.

1258
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:27,440
How can I tell him now?

1259
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:39,120
Poison. My god, what a joke.

1260
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:42,040
I would have given him more
for what he did.

1261
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:44,240
It brings us back
to Ms. Dewaere, then.

1262
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:46,000
What are you doing?

1263
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:48,000
Get out of here!

1264
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:50,600
Ah... sorry.

1265
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,360
Hello, Léopold?

1266
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:57,040
Yeah, it's me. Yeah.

1267
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:00,000
OK, I'm on my way.

1268
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:01,680
Yes, I'm alone.

1269
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:03,400
See you soon?

1270
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,520
Do you understand what I felt?

1271
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:13,240
Put yourself in my place.

1272
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,600
I was with someone with a past
I had no idea about.

1273
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:17,160
Let me digest it a little.

1274
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:18,720
So?

1275
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:20,880
This election is important.

1276
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:22,240
I'll be frank:

1277
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:25,440
in school, people called me
"the mayor," and I liked it.

1278
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:52,240
I thought you were in custody.

1279
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:53,320
I was.

1280
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:55,520
With the funny policewoman.

1281
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:01,440
I'm not sure if she's an idiot
or a real bitch.

1282
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:03,680
Maybe she's really nice.

1283
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:06,200
She's the first of her kind.

1284
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:08,400
Well, she believed me.

1285
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:10,600
I'm so relieved,
you wouldn't believe it.

1286
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:14,280
She was strange but cool
at the same time.

1287
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:17,960
Yeah, she's really strange. I agree.

1288
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:20,640
-Do you want a coffee?
-Yes, please.

1289
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:31,080
Jeanne, I want to warn you:
for Chalard's murder,

1290
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,000
you're the prime suspect.

1291
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:48,600
I'm afraid, Jeanne.

1292
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:50,440
For you, this time.

1293
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:00,040
Oscar! Here's Léopold.

1294
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:04,360
Léopold, this is Oscar.
Alias: Nonos.

1295
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:08,000
He doesn't seem like much now,
but as soon as he gets cold meat,

1296
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:10,080
he comes to life.

1297
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:12,960
And this is Léopold.
Alias: Popol,

1298
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:15,560
the God of guts,

1299
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:18,880
the Eric Clapton of intestines,
great lover of toxicology,

1300
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:23,000
-among other things...
-Thank you, my friend.

1301
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:25,960
My friends' friends are my friends.

1302
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:28,960
And if they're in forensics,
obviously,

1303
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:30,480
that's even better.

1304
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:33,520
Léopold,

1305
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:37,200
I'm sorry to make you work
secretly like this.

1306
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:39,560
Not at all!

1307
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:41,880
It reminds me of my student years,

1308
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:44,160
when we stole hands from cadavers

1309
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:46,600
to slide them in girls' pockets.

1310
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:51,080
We filled intestines with water
and put them above the kitchen door.

1311
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:53,760
It got my mom every time.

1312
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:56,240
Intestines are always good.

1313
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:09,200
What is this bucket of guts?

1314
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:20,520
That's Chalard. Léopold! Here he is!

1315
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:23,880
It reminds me of a famous
tripe recipe,

1316
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:25,800
Well prepared tripe

1317
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:27,680
is a sure way to heaven.

1318
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:31,080
It's rare. Very rare, this.

1319
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,760
And like everything rare,

1320
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:35,520
it demands time

1321
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:39,200
and infinite delicacy.

1322
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:40,560
So, we'll take our time.

1323
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:44,680
I'll leave you, then, boys,
with intestinal joys.

1324
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:46,200
I have to work.

1325
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:55,040
Come back quick, we'll miss you.

1326
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:05,600
-The two of us.
-The three of us.

1327
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:14,240
-Captain?
-I'm here.

1328
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:17,520
-I have the lab results.
-Ah, great.

1329
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:18,800
They worked hard.

1330
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:20,520
I put pressure on them.

1331
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:22,320
Bravo, my dear. Well done.

1332
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:23,960
So, Chalard's photo was taken

1333
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:27,200
with a Leica from 1956
with double viewfinders.

1334
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:30,160
It's an incredible camera.
It'll catch a drop of dew.

1335
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:31,840
OK.

1336
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:35,200
We know it was developed at home.

1337
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:36,600
That's good.

1338
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:39,800
-And you?
-I'm working, if you can't see.

1339
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,880
Because the murderer
is not here at the moment.

1340
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:46,400
But the murderer always comes back
to the crime scene.

1341
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:47,760
That's why I'm waiting.

1342
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:49,400
Did you see? This book's good.

1343
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:52,560
He wasn't lying, the guard.

1344
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:56,080
His mushrooms were indeed edible.

1345
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:58,160
Are you staying?

1346
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:00,080
I told you, I'm waiting.

1347
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:02,160
And I don't like threesomes,
so you can leave.

1348
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:06,040
-Goodbye, Captain.
-Bye, honey.

1349
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:12,400
So, inocybes...
What's that?

1350
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:17,480
So, did someone lose her earring?

1351
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:22,840
I came to see Chalard yesterday.

1352
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:28,320
For good reason.
I heard about Manon's eviction.

1353
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:30,360
I came to plead.

1354
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:31,800
And?

1355
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,080
And when I arrived, he was dead.

1356
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:36,360
Chalard?

1357
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,080
Chalard?

1358
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:01,680
Chalard?

1359
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:30,120
What time was it?

1360
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:32,120
-2:15.
-Ah, yes.

1361
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:34,520
The famous pocket watch.

1362
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:36,160
It's a good watch.

1363
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:38,200
On another note,

1364
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:41,160
do you know someone
with a photo lab at home?

1365
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:45,800
Someone who does portraits
a bit... fancy.

1366
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:46,920
Why?

1367
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:48,960
It's not for me. I prefer videos.

1368
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:51,720
No, there's a local photographer

1369
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:53,920
who immortalized Chalard
with a Leica.

1370
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:56,840
So, I'd like to see him
to discuss antiques.

1371
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,600
Do you know anyone?

1372
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:01,320
I don't know. Not me, anyway.

1373
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:05,400
OK. You can go, then.

1374
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:07,120
Is it a trap?

1375
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:09,920
You're completely paranoid!

1376
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:12,440
I'll keep the earring,
you can go home.

1377
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:15,000
Do you want to sleep with me?
I snore.

1378
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,040
Do you mind?

1379
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:22,360
Goodnight.

1380
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:42,520
They're beautiful, right?

1381
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:46,120
I need to speak to you.

1382
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:53,640
Why?

1383
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:59,240
The cop mentioned a Leica that
was used to take a photo of the body.

1384
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:02,240
I didn't say, but I know who has one.

1385
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:04,400
Why?

1386
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:07,400
For Arthur.

1387
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:08,840
What?

1388
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:15,080
When he was killed

1389
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:19,040
in an apparent hunting accident,

1390
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:22,800
we were together, him and me,

1391
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:25,520
in the clearing,

1392
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:27,400
on Chalard's land.

1393
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,760
Go and do your business elsewhere!

1394
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:44,160
Arthur...

1395
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:49,120
Arthur!

1396
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:53,040
Arthur!

1397
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:56,240
The police opened an investigation,

1398
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:57,840
but no one found the killer.

1399
01:19:58,680 --> 01:19:59,840
The case was filed away.

1400
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:01,320
Why say nothing?

1401
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:03,120
It was my revenge.

1402
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:06,800
I never saw his face.

1403
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:09,640
I never saw who fired.

1404
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:12,920
But I swore, one day I'd know.

1405
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:14,600
Why now?

1406
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:18,320
All I knew was that he was killed
by a Mauser 43.

1407
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:20,960
When the police spoke, I understood.

1408
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:34,120
Don't move!

1409
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:37,240
-What's going on?
-You're involved, too.

1410
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:38,840
You're the key piece.

1411
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:41,240
You still don't know
who killed Chalard?

1412
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:44,760
This piece that will
let you heal morbillivirus?

1413
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:46,480
Your Calabar bean.

1414
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:49,760
You know who killed Chalard? You.

1415
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:51,640
No one will believe it.

1416
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:54,400
-Oh, yes!
-I don't have a motive.

1417
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:56,840
You wanted to heal...

1418
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,080
-You wanted revenge
-Let me go!

1419
01:20:58,280 --> 01:21:00,120
for your protégés Léonard and Manon!

1420
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:02,680
Everyone knows your penchant
for delinquents.

1421
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:04,400
And you've lost this one.

1422
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:08,960
You know I've always tried
to help you.

1423
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:11,960
If you'd spoken about Arthur earlier,

1424
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:13,800
I would have done what I could.

1425
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,240
You accepted the police's version.

1426
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:18,640
No questions asked.

1427
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:22,400
Arthur trusted you,
and you left him hanging.

1428
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:24,120
Like all the others.

1429
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:28,040
Let me go!

1430
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:30,680
Let me go!

1431
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:52,360
We're here, dear.

1432
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:54,000
Did you see the newspaper?

1433
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:56,560
They put a nice suit on Chalard.

1434
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:59,680
"Shocking pants
for a fashionable man."

1435
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:01,560
Well, there's the epitaph...

1436
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:03,280
1987. Léopold Salaun.

1437
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,240
The forensic scientist
from the Angoulême murders.

1438
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:07,360
Am I right?

1439
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:10,400
-Wait, no way.
-You've had some night. Tell us.

1440
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,680
So, first point:

1441
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:15,280
Michel Chalard

1442
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:19,400
died between 12:30 and 1:00 p.m.

1443
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:23,000
-Are you sure?
-100%

1444
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:28,800
More precisely, I bet 12:50
and Oscar...

1445
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:31,280
12:42, 12:43, maximum.

1446
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:34,080
Second point: the weapon

1447
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:37,760
-was an African bean.
-No?

1448
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:39,400
-Physostigma.
-Yeah?

1449
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,560
A plant used for exorcism rituals.

1450
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:44,800
It has incredible
medicinal capacities,

1451
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,960
but, as always,

1452
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:48,840
it has a double effect.

1453
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:52,240
It can heal or... kill.

1454
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:55,080
Lethal dose: 0.2 milligrams.
Do you realize?

1455
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:59,560
By grinding it, it's very easy
to hide in food

1456
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:03,680
or to inject in a mushroom.

1457
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:04,840
Ah...

1458
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:07,520
And who has a plantation?

1459
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:11,120
Plantations for medical research?

1460
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:13,120
And who has an off-limit greenhouse?

1461
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:35,280
Well, my dear?

1462
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:38,080
The key is in the ignition.
Nothing strange.

1463
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:40,800
-We didn't find Ms. Dewaere's truck.
-Damn.

1464
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,280
I'll call Brière.
Thanks.

1465
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:46,760
Yeah, it's me.

1466
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:49,080
Can you send out a search
for Ms. Dewaere?

1467
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:51,720
And give her truck's license plate.

1468
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:52,840
Thanks.

1469
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:54,000
-Hello.
-Hello.

1470
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:55,000
-Are you OK?
-Yes.

1471
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:56,960
You're wrong if you suspect her.

1472
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:58,440
She's a good person.

1473
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:00,080
She saved my life.

1474
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:03,000
Did she say something?

1475
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:04,720
No, I didn't see her.

1476
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:07,560
I heard her car start,
but at 5:00 a.m., I'm in bed.

1477
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:10,000
Captain!

1478
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:12,400
I'm here!

1479
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:14,120
I found the weapon.

1480
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:16,800
Looks like mussels.

1481
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:18,440
No, I don't think so.

1482
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:22,840
Ah, OK.

1483
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:25,560
Was she working on bean medication?

1484
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:27,280
Is that how Michel died?

1485
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:30,120
Can I have a look around, sir?

1486
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:31,840
-Of course.
-After you.

1487
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:33,280
-Yes.
-OK.

1488
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:40,280
I have something for you. Come here.

1489
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:43,720
I've always been loyal to her.

1490
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:44,960
I'd give her my life.

1491
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:48,280
I trust you.
You're not going to arrest me.

1492
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:49,960
No, I'm not the type.

1493
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:51,720
What did I do with it?

1494
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:53,680
There it is.

1495
01:24:57,920 --> 01:24:59,400
Michel wanted me to testify.

1496
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:00,880
About what?

1497
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:03,120
That I found these in her bins.

1498
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:05,360
Just before they were emptied.

1499
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:10,440
Will that get me into trouble?

1500
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:12,240
I don't know.

1501
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:15,280
Michel is a good guy.

1502
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:17,440
We grew up together.

1503
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:20,120
It's a real shame.

1504
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:24,720
Oh, Gaby...
you know what my mom said?

1505
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:28,840
She said: "the best liars are those
who know how to shut up."

1506
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:39,320
Hi, guys. It's not warm, eh?

1507
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:41,080
I'm off to the dump.

1508
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:42,440
It's only open today.

1509
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:44,600
-No, you can't leave.
-Really?

1510
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:47,440
It's OK. We've searched it.

1511
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,280
-Go on.
-Thanks, guys.

1512
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:50,680
-Goodbye.
-You coming?

1513
01:25:57,920 --> 01:25:59,720
-How are you?
-Good.

1514
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:39,160
Do you believe Jeanne
could have killed him?

1515
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:40,600
No.

1516
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:43,240
You don't think so or you know so?

1517
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:45,600
Did she speak about her past?

1518
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:47,000
-Yeah.
-Ah, yeah?

1519
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:49,280
Did she speak about prison, her ex,

1520
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:51,120
the robberies, all of it?

1521
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:55,840
Jeanne never lied to me.

1522
01:26:56,720 --> 01:26:58,440
-I knew it all along.
-Be careful.

1523
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:02,600
Because a false testimony can
not only send a President tumbling,

1524
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:04,560
but a mayor, too.

1525
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:06,880
-So, are you sure?
-Yes.

1526
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:11,440
You know the day he was killed,

1527
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:13,880
Jeanne was at his house?
She left an earring.

1528
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:15,760
I know.

1529
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:17,000
I followed her.

1530
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:19,240
-What time was it?
-Just past 2:00 p.m.

1531
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:24,160
-But I really thought Jeanne...
-It's OK, you've cleared her.

1532
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:26,600
Chalard was already dead at 2:00 p.m.

1533
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,160
If she killed him,

1534
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:31,160
I don't know why
she would have come back.

1535
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:32,320
Unless she's sly.

1536
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:33,720
-No.
-No.

1537
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:35,160
Why are you here?

1538
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:37,960
I wanted to know something:

1539
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:40,440
your guard... what's his name...
Gabriel,

1540
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:41,840
does he have a Leica?

1541
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:45,480
-You know, to take photos.
-Yes.

1542
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:47,040
There we go.

1543
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,960
Thank you, Mr. Alain.

1544
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:54,960
Good luck!

1545
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:01,560
Don't move.
Don't move!

1546
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:04,680
Where are you taking me?

1547
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:18,400
What is it?

1548
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:20,720
He said he was off to the dump.

1549
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:23,400
And, as the truck had been checked...

1550
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:25,720
He's not there. We don't know
where he is.

1551
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:27,000
OK. What else?

1552
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:29,440
We found Ms. Dewaere's car hidden
in the wood,

1553
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:32,680
with her purse, her bank card,
her driving license.

1554
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,880
It doesn't seem
like she left voluntarily.

1555
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,720
Go and check the guard's lodge.

1556
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:39,880
Then, meet me there.

1557
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:45,720
What does he want?

1558
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:51,200
Why did you come back?

1559
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:53,560
We'll find her. Don't worry.

1560
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:55,880
Stop following me. It annoys me.

1561
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,280
You're very clingy.

1562
01:28:57,920 --> 01:28:59,920
-Captain! Captain!
-What is it?

1563
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,480
-Come and see.
-What?

1564
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:03,200
Didn't you understand?

1565
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:07,320
This is where she must have been.

1566
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:10,920
What's that?

1567
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:17,280
Your girlfriend said she'd
never collaborate with cops.

1568
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:18,880
She left us this.

1569
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,840
But she didn't say the destination.

1570
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:22,480
-Captain!
-Yeah?

1571
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:24,640
-Here's the Leica.
-Yeah.

1572
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:26,200
I found it here.

1573
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:28,440
Look, it's a real photo lab.

1574
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:30,640
OK, I don't understand.

1575
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:33,000
OK, let's go back to the start.

1576
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:35,720
So, Gabriel, the guard,

1577
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:38,320
he distorted Chalard's body

1578
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:40,600
with pants, red lipstick,
all sorts of things.

1579
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:43,280
He takes a photo.
He sends it to the newspaper.

1580
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:46,560
Do you know your electorates?

1581
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:48,880
-Why would he do that?
-I don't know.

1582
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:52,720
It's even stranger to distort him
knowing Chalard was traditional.

1583
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,760
He wanted women to wear dresses,
men to be men.

1584
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:57,640
He was very homophobic.

1585
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:01,840
And Gabriel and Arthur,

1586
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:03,480
did they know each other?

1587
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:05,640
They were always together
before he died.

1588
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:07,760
-How did he die?
-Hunting accident.

1589
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:09,440
-Where?
-On Chalard's property.

1590
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:10,720
In the clearing.

1591
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:12,880
That seems suspicious.

1592
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,600
Let's go. Quickly!

1593
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:16,720
Hurry up!

1594
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:28,600
-Where are we going?
-Keep going!

1595
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:33,880
Stop! You're hurting me.

1596
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:41,040
Let me go!

1597
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:24,720
I admit to killing Michel Chalard,
who was going to denounce me.

1598
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:27,320
Unable to live with my act,

1599
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:29,440
I decided to kill myself

1600
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,920
in the same way I killed him.

1601
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:40,520
Stay there.

1602
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:44,440
I admit to killing Michel Chalard

1603
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:47,720
who was going to denounce me

1604
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:50,920
Unable to live with my act,

1605
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:55,040
I decided to kill myself
in the same way I killed him.

1606
01:31:58,880 --> 01:31:59,640
My only regret

1607
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:02,480
is that no one will know
what he did to Arthur.

1608
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:05,440
You're right, Gabriel.

1609
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:07,160
Everyone should know.

1610
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:09,720
Don't kill me.

1611
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:25,040
Don't move!

1612
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:40,320
OK, Captain?

1613
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:41,880
Thanks, Brière.

1614
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:47,240
Let me go!
Let me go!

1615
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:49,200
Let me go, pigs!

1616
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:52,520
Let me go!

1617
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:55,640
Are you writing memoirs?

1618
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:57,880
No, I'm writing
Captain Marleau's lessons.

1619
01:32:58,080 --> 01:32:59,760
-You idiot.
-Can you sign it for me?

1620
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:02,680
Do you want a selfie, too?

1621
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:04,320
And don't forget,

1622
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:09,040
first lesson: disobedience.
It's compulsory.

1623
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:11,080
I'm touched, Captain.

1624
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:13,760
Well, what did you think?
I do have a heart.

1625
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:15,160
I need to say something.

1626
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:17,320
Listen well, I won't repeat it.

1627
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:20,640
One: I love you totally,

1628
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:23,400
past, present and future.

1629
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:26,240
Two: I have a childhood friend
who's a great lawyer.

1630
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:27,760
Your defense'll be strong.

1631
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:31,080
Three: I love being mayor,

1632
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:33,080
but I love you more.

1633
01:33:34,120 --> 01:33:35,040
Jeanne,

1634
01:33:36,040 --> 01:33:37,880
I have the honor of not asking you.

1635
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:40,640
Let's not get married.

1636
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:42,120
But I want to.

1637
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:58,760
The tripe is served.

1638
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:00,320
Thank you.

1639
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:01,920
Tripe! Tripe!

1640
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:04,120
She's promising, the little girl.

1641
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:07,080
Yes, I'm proud of my new recruit.

1642
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:09,320
Shame that Ms. Dewaere has her.

1643
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:12,320
Well, as you know,
I need a new guard for the park.

1644
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:15,320
Manon applied.

1645
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:18,400
She was very convincing
in the interview.

1646
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:19,160
Surprised?

1647
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:21,320
I hope you'll keep up
your activities.

1648
01:34:21,880 --> 01:34:24,640
And stop putting banners in trees.
Do graffiti.

1649
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:26,040
It's quicker and safer.

1650
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:31,760
As a souvenir
of an unforgettable autopsy,

1651
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:34,960
as precise as you, dear friend and

1652
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:38,600
delicious like you, my dear.

1653
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:40,040
To the red moon,

1654
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:42,480
to all the gingers

1655
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:44,480
and the Zorros of the world.

1656
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:46,480
And to the law.

1657
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:47,200
Subtitling: Hiventy
