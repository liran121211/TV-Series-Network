1
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,340
BETWEEN WINDS AND TIDES

2
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,780
Alex.

3
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,340
Can you take some pictures?

4
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,180
I think there are
strangulation marks.

5
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,180
OK? Thanks.

6
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,500
Gwen is dead.

7
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,980
- What?
- Yeah.

8
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,140
The police have summoned me
for 6pm.

9
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,140
- Why?
- I don't know.

10
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,860
They'll want to know
about her internship.

11
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,300
She left with Salmon last night.

12
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,780
You saw her too.

13
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,740
I can't get it out of my mind.

14
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,220
You don't think he could have...

15
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,140
A 17-year-old girl...
Nobody would do that.

16
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,780
And yet somebody did.

17
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,700
Not him.

18
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,900
Then why did they leave together?

19
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,060
I don't know!

20
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,500
What do you know about him?
Where's he from?

21
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,140
Where does all his money come from?

22
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,340
He earned it.

23
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:05,180
You're under his spell.
You're useless when he's around.

24
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,940
I'll go and talk to him!

25
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,020
Do you think he'll tell you
if he killed Gwen?

26
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:37,940
Tarek!

27
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,300
What's up? Wait.

28
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,060
- What's the matter?
- Yann's sister Gwen is dead.

29
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,380
Was it an accident?

30
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,740
No. My dad's just told me
she was murdered.

31
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,220
It'll be all right.
Look at me. It'll be OK.

32
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,100
You come in on Sundays?

33
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,020
In the hope of running into you.

34
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,460
You're as attractive as ever.

35
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,580
One day, my grandma said to me:

36
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,460
"You're as beautiful as sin."

37
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,740
That would suit you.

38
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,180
Is that a compliment?

39
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:38,460
Who knows?
You'll have to ask my grandma.

40
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,180
You certainly seemed
to charm Gwen.

41
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:46,340
Not really. I drove her home,
but I didn't even get a kiss.

42
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,300
"Goodbye, see you on Monday."

43
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,340
Youngsters nowadays...

44
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,700
- You didn't go back to your place?
- No.

45
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,060
That's a good thing,
because they've just found her body.

46
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,740
No. That can't be true.

47
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,940
- What happened?
- She was killed.

48
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,460
Let me be frank.

49
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,020
I don't want to do the cops' job,

50
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:20,220
but Gwen gave Josephine
the bill of sale to sign.

51
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,180
So?

52
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,660
They argued.

53
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,180
Josephine was furious with Gwen.

54
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,540
I've never liked Josephine.

55
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,060
She's got a crazy side to her.

56
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,340
And you think she killed Christian?

57
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,460
He sold us a plot,
and he was killed shortly after.

58
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,900
Gwen and Josephine argued,
and then Gwen is killed...

59
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,740
That woman is evil, Nadia.

60
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,020
She leaves death in her wake.

61
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,460
You may be right.

62
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,020
You didn't stay with Gwen?

63
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,260
I swear on what I hold dearest:
my mother.

64
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:06,340
Anyway, I've always preferred
mature women.

65
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:13,180
It's like with seasons,
I prefer summer to spring.

66
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,180
Go away.

67
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,100
Go away. I want to be alone.

68
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,540
Let me sit in a corner.

69
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,380
I promise I won't talk.

70
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,620
Someone will have to talk to Yann
when he comes back.

71
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,740
Ferdinand can give you something
to help you sleep.

72
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:56,060
I don't want to sleep.
I want to think about Gwen.

73
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,740
And...

74
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,060
go to the boathouse.
Tell Richard we're closing shop.

75
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,780
Can I go and see Cecile?

76
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,340
She doesn't want to see anyone.

77
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,980
Not even you?

78
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,460
There must be people
who are closer to her than I am.

79
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,340
I doubt it.

80
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,900
Calm down.

81
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,780
Take this, it will do you good.

82
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,780
All I did was go to town for an hour!

83
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,620
Jo... please.

84
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,100
No. Stop it! No!

85
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:07,620
Hello.

86
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,180
It was open, so I let myself in.

87
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,500
I've brought you something.

88
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,860
This.

89
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,380
That's your scarf.

90
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,860
Don't you want to know
where I found it?

91
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,620
I found it on the rocks,

92
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,780
on Gwen Prigent's body.

93
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,780
Where were you this morning?

94
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,220
She was here, with me.

95
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,500
- Really?
- We've been together all morning.

96
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,500
Right...

97
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,460
That's strange,

98
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,780
because someone saw you
driving in town this morning.

99
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,100
And I touched your engine.

100
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,940
It's still warm.

101
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,860
So I think you're lying.

102
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,580
You're both lying.

103
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,660
No?

104
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:59,060
It's 11.05am. You are in police
custody in connection with the murder

105
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,460
of Gwen Prigent.
Please follow me.

106
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,780
Cecile Prigent.

107
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,660
We've asked to see you
but you'll have to come back later.

108
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,820
Thank you.

109
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,940
Come in.

110
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,020
It's cold in here.

111
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,220
Cup of tea?

112
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,260
One like you have,

113
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,940
with malt whisky.

114
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,020
There... Lots of whisky.

115
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,940
We don't need any tea.

116
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,740
There you are.

117
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,100
Take it!

118
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,500
Cheers.

119
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,940
I'll fetch Mr Quemener.

120
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,100
Mr Quemener,
can you come in here, please?

121
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,380
Hello.

122
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,100
Come in, please.

123
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,820
Hello.

124
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,660
You already know each other,
don't you?

125
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,500
- Yes.
- Of course.

126
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:02,460
So then, Mr Quemener,

127
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:06,540
Mrs de Kersaint-Gilly signed
a sales agreement with your company.

128
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,460
Yesterday afternoon.

129
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:13,100
And your niece Gwen
recorded the signature.

130
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,220
That's correct.

131
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:20,940
- Were you angry with her?
- Why would I be? I wanted to sell.

132
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,380
You told me that you wanted
to die on your land.

133
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,900
- Have you changed your mind?
- Yes.

134
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,100
The bailiffs changed my mind.

135
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,540
"The bailiffs"... Right.

136
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,380
Mr Quemener, however, says

137
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:39,660
that you had a very violent argument
with Gwen.

138
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,380
Is that true?

139
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,540
It's none of your business.

140
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,260
None of my business?

141
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,100
When there are two bodies,
everything is my business.

142
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,540
Why did you tell Gwen

143
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,820
that she was indebted to you?

144
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,900
It's just a phrase!

145
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,340
That's great. Thanks, ma'am.

146
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,380
Mr Quemener, I'll see you out.

147
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,820
Let's go.

148
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,980
I'll be back in a tick.
I'll do the washing-up.

149
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,380
Come on then, Mr Quemener.

150
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,220
Keep an eye on Kersaint-Gilly.

151
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,980
Wait, Mr Quemener!

152
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,220
Stay there, I'll be right back.

153
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,100
Alex.

154
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,420
I need you to compare the DNA
on this glass

155
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,700
with the DNA found on the victim.

156
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,700
That'll take 10 days.

157
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,260
No. I need it tomorrow.

158
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:48,100
Otherwise I'll shoot you
with a gun without a serial number.

159
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,620
I'm not the human-resources
manager.

160
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,980
Why would I have to manage
human resources?

161
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,540
I'm fed up with it.

162
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,980
Mr Quemener,
why did you hire your niece?

163
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:03,180
She'd always wanted
to be an architect.

164
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,540
She dreamt of working with us.

165
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,420
That's very nice of you.

166
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,140
But it's not innocent,

167
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,420
seeing that you wanted to buy
your sister's boathouse.

168
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,700
So what?

169
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,420
Ill-intentioned people might say:
"He hired the daughter

170
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,700
"to influence the mother."
See?

171
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,980
- I don't see, no.
- Neither do I.

172
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,820
I'm still searching.

173
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,900
I do research, like Pasteur.

174
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,060
- Goodbye, Mr Quemener.
- Goodbye.

175
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,700
Why is she in police custody?

176
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,420
Why Gwen? What had she done?

177
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,620
I don't know.

178
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,380
But my grandma's being held
for questioning.

179
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,820
It's OK, stay.

180
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,540
It makes no sense.

181
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,580
What are you doing?
They're my grandma's things!

182
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,140
Not any more.

183
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,220
Come on, gentlemen, let's go.

184
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,420
- Are you sure?
- 99% sure.

185
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,140
99%? Is that your answer?
It's tepid!

186
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,300
You can't be loved by everyone.

187
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:11,420
I chose to be loved by some
and hated by others.

188
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,140
- Sure or not?
- Sure.

189
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,860
Good. I like you.

190
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,860
You're welcome!

191
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,300
Are you coping?

192
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,860
Could my grandma
have killed her husband and Gwen?

193
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,140
It's crazy!

194
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,860
I can't believe it.

195
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,940
My grandpa, maybe,
but not Gwen.

196
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:41,220
She mentioned her
at every opportunity, comparing us.

197
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:45,100
I was always less brilliant,
less blond, less everything.

198
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,220
Gwen was her dream granddaughter.

199
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,740
Her hair always looked nice,
she was always so clever...

200
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,140
Listen...
Yesterday, I went to the office.

201
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:00,020
I heard Nadia Quemener
and Vincent Salmon

202
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:03,860
talking about Gwen.
She asked him if he'd left with her.

203
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,580
"Left"?
As in gone home together?

204
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,020
Maybe. He denied it

205
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,540
but she didn't seem to believe him.

206
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,180
And then they...

207
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,940
- Well...
- Spit it out!

208
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,420
They made love.

209
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,660
You really don't want to eat?

210
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,180
It's good, it's cheese.

211
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:43,900
Right.
Shall we stop messing around now?

212
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,980
I'll recap.

213
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:51,460
First of all, your husband
was found on your land,

214
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,740
murdered with a hunting rifle.

215
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:00,620
That's unfortunate for you
because you don't have an alibi

216
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,460
but you do have a very good motive.

217
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,020
Your husband was ruining you.

218
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,460
Shall I go on?

219
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:13,460
Gwen Prigent is then found murdered.

220
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,580
It so happens

221
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:18,860
that you were overheard
having a violent argument with her.

222
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,380
And your scarf was found
on her body.

223
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,820
That's not great.

224
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:29,260
You say you have an alibi,
that you were with your doctor,

225
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,180
Dr Lebovitz.

226
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,740
Unfortunately, I have a witness
who says you weren't.

227
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:40,300
You were seen driving
in your car at that time.

228
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,900
That's not great either.

229
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,620
I didn't tell you...
I called your bank.

230
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:57,580
Apparently you opened
an account for Gwen.

231
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,620
How come? That's odd.

232
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,300
You've been putting money in it
for 16 years.

233
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:09,420
That's a long time.
Especially when you're broke.

234
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,580
No?

235
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,540
So why have you hidden

236
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,740
the fact you're Gwen's grandma?

237
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:30,620
Does Cecile know that Gwen
isn't her daughter?

238
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,820
She won't like it when you tell her.

239
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,340
That's some family secret!

240
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,020
Still not hungry?

241
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,780
Don't you want to finish
your sandwich?

242
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,540
- It'll help, you'll see.
- If you say so.

243
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,060
That's just how you were
at the clinic.

244
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,460
You thought I couldn't heal you.

245
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,780
And yet I got
your smile back, didn't I?

246
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:21,180
- That was a thousand years ago.
- No! 17 years ago.

247
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:26,060
Right. You should sleep now.

248
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,860
I'll take my leave.

249
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,180
- Is my mum OK?
- Yes. She should sleep.

250
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,220
I hate this waiting.

251
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,620
Let the cops do their job.

252
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,580
Do you remember,
when Gwen was born,

253
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,340
Cecile was having
a nervous breakdown...

254
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,900
Yes, I remember.

255
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,220
You were the opposite.
You were incredibly happy.

256
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,940
That was the happiest time
in my life.

257
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,780
And the most horrible.

258
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,780
Within a year,
I'd lived my life on fast-forward.

259
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,500
I met Solene, she got pregnant,

260
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,940
and she died...

261
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:31,140
After that, all I wanted
was to get away,

262
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,500
to stay out at sea.

263
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:36,500
"The eternal widower",
as Cecile called you.

264
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,620
That sounds like a criticism.

265
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,460
No, you were perfect.

266
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,940
You went to see her,
brought flowers...

267
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:48,780
but did you ever wonder
why she had a breakdown?

268
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,940
Just after you met Solene.

269
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,660
We need to know what happened.

270
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,900
They've arrested Josephine.

271
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,900
What does that mean?

272
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,220
Did she do it?

273
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,220
Maybe not.

274
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,380
Dammit...

275
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,260
How long are we going to
just sit and wait?

276
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:43,660
- Don't you want to do something?
- I want to see Gwen, and hug her.

277
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,660
Have you got a solution?

278
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,380
I thought you might be hungry.

279
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:24,500
I should get back.
Etienne will be wondering where I am.

280
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,380
Tell him you were
at an inauguration.

281
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:29,180
Don't worry about me,
I know how to lie.

282
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,380
Any news about the investigation?

283
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,620
Are you worried?

284
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:37,020
No, but I find Josephine scary.

285
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,300
So scornful and self-assured.

286
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,780
You should know.

287
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:43,620
Your family has suffered
because of them.

288
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:49,780
Why are you bringing up my family?
How do you know?

289
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,300
You told me.

290
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,300
That my mother worked for them?

291
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,580
I never did.

292
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,580
Etienne must have told me, then.

293
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,580
Are you sure you've not
enquired about me?

294
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,140
Power is making you paranoid.

295
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,700
Maybe.

296
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,260
My mother worked
for that woman for 10 years.

297
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,740
- You lived on their estate?
- Yes.

298
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:20,620
I lived in the house in the clearing
where Ingrid lives now.

299
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:25,180
Renan was a little prince
and I was the caretakers' daughter.

300
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,740
I'll never forgive her.

301
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,420
- Did they treat you badly?
- Not even.

302
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,180
They never shouted at me.

303
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:35,340
They even gave me dolls
for Christmas, with neat blond hair.

304
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,100
They were condescending,

305
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,420
the way masters are
with their servants.

306
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,340
Poor you...

307
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:45,300
I don't want to be pitied,
I want to be respected.

308
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,140
Hello?

309
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,900
Wait a second.

310
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,860
Yes, it's working.

311
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,980
Josephine de Kersaint-Gilly
is in police custody.

312
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,380
OK.

313
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,740
Where were you?
I've been waiting for 3 hours!

314
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,580
I was at the prefecture.

315
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,860
The commission
has approved the blueprint.

316
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,860
- We're going to have our marina.
- Wonderful.

317
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,180
Is that it?

318
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:58,180
I thought you were going to
leap for joy!

319
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,580
I was so impatient to tell you!

320
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,300
I am delighted, really.

321
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,900
We've got to call Salmon.

322
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,700
I can't reach him.
Have you seen him?

323
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,620
No. Why would I have?

324
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,740
What's up, Nadia?

325
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,300
Still nothing to say?

326
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,820
I've got better things to do.
I'm wasting my time.

327
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,740
You can go home.

328
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:32,900
Scram!

329
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,020
Just like that?

330
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,820
Yeah, just like that.

331
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,180
I forgot to tell you...

332
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,860
Prepare an overnight bag.

333
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:59,620
If ever you're remanded in custody,
you'll be needing mittens,

334
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,140
thermals,
jumpers - not cashmere.

335
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,180
Things get pinched in jail,
and it's cold.

336
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:08,180
I've not had heating at home
for a long time.

337
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:11,900
The temperature may be the same,
but the atmosphere isn't!

338
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,860
There's the bars on the windows
and the smell...

339
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:20,620
Since you've got some free time,
sort out your family secrets.

340
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,060
It won't do you any harm.

341
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,820
Goodbye, Mrs Kersaint-Gilly.

342
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,460
"De Kersaint-Gilly"...

343
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:30,900
Tarek!

344
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,340
They've released you?

345
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,420
They're not very friendly.

346
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:46,020
They're waiting for me
to be charged with both murders.

347
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:49,500
I've been to my house.
It looks odd without furniture.

348
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:53,300
The bailiffs took everything.
Sorry, I couldn't stop them.

349
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,100
I can live without furniture.

350
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,060
Right...

351
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,420
Would you like some tea?

352
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,300
Sure.

353
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,940
Thanks.

354
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,900
I've not killed anybody.

355
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,500
I believe you.

356
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,420
I've not known you very long,

357
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:26,100
but I know you couldn't do
such a thing.

358
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,460
I feel like giving you a hug.

359
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,420
- What's holding me back?
- Nothing, really.

360
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:42,340
The bailiffs I saw when I was younger
didn't give me any hugs.

361
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,180
Neither did my mother.

362
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:53,340
I'm not sure what that was,
but I feel I'm interrupting.

363
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,340
I'm teaching the signs of affection.

364
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:07,340
You sure pick your moments!

365
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:10,060
I'm afraid I have
to talk to you, Renan.

366
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,780
And you're not going
to like this moment.

367
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,500
Lebovitz lives here.

368
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,780
Dr Lebovitz
General Practitioner

369
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,140
Anybody home?

370
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,580
This isn't a state-run hospital!

371
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,660
Yes?

372
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,420
- Hello.
- Hello.

373
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,460
I'd like to see Dr Lebovitz.

374
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:08,660
I'm sorry,
he's out seeing patients.

375
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,740
I'm Captain Marleau.

376
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:15,220
I'd like to see the clinic archives.

377
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:19,900
Without the doctor's permission,
I don't think I can...

378
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,020
- This his desk?
- Yes.

379
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,340
That's funny...

380
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,380
That's nice.

381
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,940
Wood fires are great.

382
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,620
I use gas for heating...

383
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,620
It's expensive!

384
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:39,780
I'd like to see the archives for '97,
Cecile Prigent's delivery.

385
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:42,220
Not Pringent. "I", Prigent.

386
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,740
"I", for "intelligence."

387
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,580
I told you, I can't.

388
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:49,380
Yes, you can. Just get up
and fetch them. Come on!

389
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:56,900
- You're responsible.
- Yes, I'm responsible.

390
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,500
There they are!
You see? You could.

391
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,940
Thank you, miss.

392
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,620
Could I have a coffee, too?

393
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,780
"Cecile Prigent"...

394
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,780
Hello, doctor! How are you?

395
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,380
What are you doing here?

396
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,660
Those are confidential files!

397
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,340
Oh well, too bad.

398
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:29,220
- Let's talk pregnancies.
- Are you pregnant?

399
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,580
No. Why?

400
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:34,380
Oh, no! I mean an old pregnancy
that happened 17 years ago.

401
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,660
The thing that's troubling me

402
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:41,620
is that Gwen Prigent
and Ingrid de Kersaint-Gilly

403
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,500
are both 17.

404
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:45,740
I don't get it.

405
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,940
Born the same day
in the same clinic.

406
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,620
That can happen.

407
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,380
Sure.

408
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,660
Swapped babies are rare, though.

409
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,260
Though my mum used to say:

410
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,460
"They must have
swapped you at birth."

411
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,460
What was I saying?
Oh, yes!

412
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:04,300
Did you know that
Josephine de Kersaint-Gilly

413
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,740
and the Prigent girl were related?

414
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,940
- I don't understand.
- Yes, you do.

415
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,940
I'm not going to teach you about DNA!

416
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:19,060
I've compared the two:
100% compatible.

417
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:22,180
There's no point lying, doctor.

418
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,580
I know the story.

419
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,100
I'd just like to hear your version.

420
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,700
Leave.

421
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,660
Very well.

422
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:47,460
Cecile and Solene gave birth
the same day in my clinic.

423
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:51,380
Renan's wife was clinically dead.

424
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,940
When I managed to deliver
her child,

425
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:57,100
the baby girl was also half dead.

426
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,900
Doctor Lebovitz!

427
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:04,700
Cecile was giving birth
in the room next door.

428
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,300
Or rather, didn't want to give birth.

429
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,100
She'd spent 3 months in my clinic
for depression.

430
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,620
Was it the same
when her son was born?

431
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,460
No, it was just for that child.

432
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,940
She didn't want to give birth to it.

433
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:37,180
I'll take her.
Put the other one in an incubator.

434
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,740
I don't think I understand.

435
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,460
Ferdinand told me
that Solene wouldn't live,

436
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,740
nor would your daughter,
or so he thought.

437
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,300
I panicked.

438
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:01,580
I thought a child
would give you a reason to live...

439
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:06,100
So we took the babies
and we swapped them.

440
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,540
You mean Gwen was my daughter?

441
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,620
But... we thought
she wouldn't live.

442
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,460
- And?
- And, and...

443
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:25,900
Nothing. Time went by.

444
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:28,100
Cecile recovered
from her breakdown,

445
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,540
she raised her daughter
with her big brother,

446
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,540
she loved her,
adored her, protected her.

447
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:39,940
That was her way to make up for
those difficult early days and...

448
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:45,260
And Gwen became
this wonderful young girl...

449
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,260
so pretty, so smart.

450
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,260
That's why you loved her.

451
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,740
Because she was
your real granddaughter.

452
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,540
And you raised Ingrid,

453
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,860
Cecile's daughter. That's it.

454
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,300
Why keep it quiet?

455
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,180
We couldn't turn back the clock.

456
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,380
That's just the way it is!

457
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:16,260
It seemed unfair to give Cecile
the only child that was alive

458
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,700
when she screamed
that she didn't want it.

459
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,740
And to tell you that your wife
and daughter had died...

460
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,020
That's it.

461
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,620
- You are a monster.
- No.

462
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,180
No.

463
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,460
We thought we could
balance out fate.

464
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,620
People who think they're God
are scary.

465
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,660
Sounds a bit schizo, doesn't it?

466
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,460
What a lot of X-rays!

467
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,380
They're lung X-rays.

468
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:03,260
So I see.
But there's more. Look.

469
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,300
And a femur.
What's this?

470
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:10,140
A foot. It's a nice one.

471
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,180
And a head...

472
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:18,900
So what? I don't know
what you're getting at.

473
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,860
Josephine's body...

474
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,260
You know it by heart.

475
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,180
I'm her family doctor.

476
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,700
Not only her doctor.

477
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,900
You've written little notes.

478
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,420
Lovely style.

479
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:40,820
It reads like Chateaubriand,
in a medical way.

480
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,340
And I quote:

481
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,540
"Josephine came to consult me today.

482
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,460
"Slight fever, sensitive chest."

483
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,460
"She looks paler than usual."

484
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,020
"I fear she may have
an ear infection."

485
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:58,420
"Josephine is wilting."
That's not very elegant.

486
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,900
"I'd like to send her to Italy."

487
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,140
Nicer than La Bourboule!

488
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,740
"Her foot is sore.

489
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:07,980
"I'd so like to..." What's that?
"...protect her"?

490
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,900
That's so cute.
Honestly, bravo.

491
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,300
I like that.

492
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:16,060
But it doesn't read
like someone's medical file.

493
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,860
So what does it read like?

494
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,620
I don't know.
A lesson in the anatomy of love?

495
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,300
You can't do this.

496
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:32,140
Why did Ferdinand go along with it?

497
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,900
He's always admired my mother.

498
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:38,180
If she asked him
to jump into a fire, he'd do it.

499
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,340
He was always there
to heal our bumps,

500
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,780
my mum's migraines,

501
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:45,620
to keep an eye on her cholesterol,
her blood pressure,

502
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,740
even her alcohol consumption.

503
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,620
You mean he's in love with her?

504
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:55,180
Yes. Maybe that's what
being in love is all about.

505
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,860
That's why Josephine
wanted to separate them.

506
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,620
Brother and sister...

507
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,780
Are you OK?

508
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:29,060
We need to talk, honey.

509
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:31,140
Is there any news?

510
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,420
Yes.

511
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,780
What are we waiting for?

512
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:43,180
"Patience and the fullness of time
do more than force or fury";

513
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:46,140
as my old colleague "Rat Face"
used to say.

514
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:51,300
Ah... There she is.

515
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,860
Hello. Come in.

516
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,140
Please take a seat.

517
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:08,500
So, Mrs de Kersaint-Gilly,

518
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:12,220
did you consult
Dr Ferdinand Lebovitz

519
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,780
- that's a nice name -

520
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:16,500
on 7 February, at 10pm?

521
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,020
I'm in bed by 10pm.

522
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:21,580
Really? I go to bed early, too.

523
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:23,060
I watch series.

524
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:27,140
I say that because you have marks
around your neck,

525
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,500
and Dr Lebovitz...

526
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:32,740
I'm not inventing this,
he wrote it down.

527
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,420
He says you had
"strangulation marks

528
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,460
"at the jugulars."
Here, right?

529
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,940
How could you have known
without seeing her?

530
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:44,140
I found out later.
I drew conclusions.

531
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:47,220
Very smart!

532
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:50,900
Good conclusion.
And did you find out

533
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,620
on the eve of her husband's death?

534
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:01,860
- So that means Gwen was...
- My daughter.

535
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:07,140
- And you are...
- Yes. You know as much as us now.

536
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:15,940
All I can add is that...

537
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:18,660
every month, I drew a line
on the castle wall.

538
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:21,620
That wall saw you grow
one centimetre at a time.

539
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:23,180
As did I.

540
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:26,860
You are my daughter and I don't care
what DNA says.

541
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:28,220
I love you, Dad.

542
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:33,940
You didn't ask for this, poor Ingrid,
but we can't pretend we don't know.

543
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:36,020
So what do we do?

544
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:39,740
I'm convinced that being a parent

545
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:42,460
isn't a given.
You have to earn it.

546
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:46,220
We'll create something,
a new family.

547
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,300
I'm sure we'll find a way.

548
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:53,220
I know it will be easy.

549
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:56,660
I've loved you
for a long time already.

550
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:22,300
Mrs de Kersaint-Gilly
is going to be charged with

551
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,740
the murder of her husband.

552
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:26,500
Considering the evidence,

553
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,900
I think she'll get at least 15 years.

554
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:30,500
Is that what you want?

555
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:34,620
You've always helped her.

556
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:37,780
If you want to do something,
now's the time.

557
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,940
Don't tell me you don't care
she'll go to prison!

558
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:44,940
You've always cared for her.

559
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,140
Do you know
what she'll go through?

560
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,460
So?

561
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:01,300
It's true, Josephine.

562
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:04,060
I killed Christian.

563
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:06,220
I couldn't stand his hitting you.

564
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:15,460
- You saw us?
- Yes.

565
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:20,020
But how? It was dark.

566
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:26,620
I always follow you.
I watch you.

567
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:30,740
I hide in the bushes.
I try to hold my breath.

568
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:33,940
I know all your habits:

569
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:36,740
your morning walk, your evening one.

570
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:40,300
Only that night,
nothing was as usual.

571
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:43,900
You were with Christian
and you were having an argument.

572
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:00,980
Because it's late and very dark.

573
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:03,460
There's a full moon.

574
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:05,900
I'll walk you home.

575
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:08,940
Oh, wait. Christian...

576
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:10,940
The bank called.

577
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:13,580
There's 8,000 euros missing.

578
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:16,140
- Bankers are jerks.
- Who can count.

579
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:17,780
Where did the money go?

580
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:21,700
- That's none of your business.
- Yes it is! You're ruining us!

581
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,940
And you stink of alcohol.

582
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:27,500
Goddamn it!

583
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:32,300
- No...
- Let her go!

584
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:33,540
Let her go!

585
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,660
Stupid bitch!

586
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:41,460
Are you OK?

587
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:49,620
I couldn't bear to see him
harm this woman.

588
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:56,380
Josephine!

589
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:00,500
Josephine, are you there?

590
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:13,180
Open the door, for God's sake!

591
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:15,300
Come on, Jo!

592
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:18,780
I'm sorry about yesterday.
I was angry.

593
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:20,300
I can explain.

594
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:27,940
Josephine?

595
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:33,860
Is someone there?

596
00:47:58,380 --> 00:47:59,580
Come on...

597
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:01,380
Can I say goodbye to him?

598
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:13,380
- I don't know what to say.
- Don't say anything.

599
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:19,580
Someone taught me
how to do that.

600
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:30,220
You've left them alone in there?

601
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:34,380
If they wanted to run off together,
they'd have done it long ago.

602
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:38,380
What? Do you never watch
TV series?

603
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,780
You don't read romantic novels?

604
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:42,940
- No.
- There's a surprise!

605
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:45,500
When I saw you,
I thought: "He doesn't."

606
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:48,540
You're the kind who plays
table tennis, right?

607
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:41,620
Not bad, eh?

608
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,220
I could watch it 1,000 times!

609
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:52,860
- Do you want a drink?
- No thanks.

610
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:10,740
It's beautiful!

611
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:22,340
So the cops bought the story
of the old bag doing it?

612
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:24,780
I think so.
She was in police custody.

613
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:28,460
They released her after 48 hours
pending her indictment.

614
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:30,100
Things are looking up.

615
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:32,500
Yes, but I can't sleep at night.

616
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:33,740
She was 17.

617
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:37,180
That's no age to die.

618
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:41,740
This is no time for weakness.

619
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:43,700
Don't be stupid.

620
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:46,180
The boss likes you.

621
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:49,460
He can't keep guys
who feel melancholic.

622
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:51,660
They don't make good employees.

623
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:53,220
I'm not a robot.

624
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,180
I know. What a shame!

625
00:51:58,380 --> 00:51:59,860
You have to make do.

626
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,100
He can't criticize me.

627
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:06,540
I made no mistakes with Gwen.

628
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:09,900
I like seeing you like this.

629
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:13,500
With your usual... fieriness.

630
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:18,380
Here.
That should pay for everything.

631
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:21,820
And finance
the death of Cecile Prigent.

632
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:01,860
Cecile, get up.

633
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:03,980
- We've got a problem.
- What?

634
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:06,300
The commission has approved
the marina.

635
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,580
They're laying down cement.

636
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:11,180
There's another problem.
Richard has left.

637
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:12,620
He's left?

638
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:14,420
He's found a job elsewhere.

639
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:16,860
He's 58!
Who's given him work?

640
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:18,220
Your brother.

641
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:20,460
Bastard!

642
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:22,140
We have to fight.

643
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,500
We need you.

644
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,940
For the marina,
for Yann, for my father.

645
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:29,700
- And for me, too.
- Yes, you're right.

646
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:31,980
We can't let them
get away with it.

647
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:33,340
That's the spirit!

648
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:35,500
They're all avoiding me.

649
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:40,020
I can understand why.
I've messed up their lives.

650
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:42,820
What you did was awful.

651
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:44,700
That's sweet. And honest!

652
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:50,980
And my poor Ferdinand is in jail.

653
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:53,740
He feels the cold.

654
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:57,940
He likes to be surrounded
by his little things.

655
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:01,820
Oh no, not her!

656
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:10,460
I see the bailiffs
weren't very conciliatory.

657
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:11,740
No.

658
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:15,900
They'd take the plaster
I put in the cracks if they could.

659
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:18,540
But Tarek brought me
a teapot and a stove.

660
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:20,060
And Renan?

661
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:24,820
He's on his boat.
He doesn't want to see me.

662
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:27,900
I've brought you your money back.
Well, Gwen's.

663
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,820
Keep it, it's yours.

664
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:33,620
- I don't want it.
- I don't know what to say to you.

665
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:36,820
I loved my son...

666
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:40,180
When I heard Solene had died,

667
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:42,300
I thought he might kill himself.

668
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:45,980
A child would force him
to stay alive.

669
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:49,620
- And you didn't stop shouting...
- That I was a bad mum?

670
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:50,860
I know.

671
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:56,380
Forgive me.

672
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:58,380
That's not why I'm here.

673
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:02,460
I'm asking you to change your mind
about selling up.

674
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:05,660
That's not possible.
I've signed all the deeds.

675
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:08,860
Buy it back
with the money you'd given Gwen.

676
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:12,660
Fight with us against the marina.
We need everyone on board.

677
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:19,860
Even me?

678
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:24,060
It's too late to undo
what you've done.

679
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:28,740
Concentrate on what can be saved:
Ingrid, Yann, Renan,

680
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:30,700
and me.

681
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:50,140
We've done it. It's incredible.

682
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:53,140
Do you like it?

683
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:55,380
Thanks.

684
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:21,620
- It's amazing.
- Yes, it's beautiful.

685
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:22,620
Magical!

686
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:27,780
We've done it.

687
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:33,180
Are you pleased, Vincent?

688
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:41,180
I have always been a supporter
of daring architecture

689
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:43,100
and modern designs.

690
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:46,980
Today I am proud to inaugurate
the first stage in our marina,

691
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:49,060
the Sunshine Lighthouse!

692
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:51,060
Bravo!

693
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:57,020
This lighthouse will represent
our town's progression

694
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:59,460
towards a world that looks ahead

695
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:02,660
and faces the future!

696
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:14,740
Bravo!

697
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:22,980
Dear friends, can I ask you
to raise your glasses?

698
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:35,820
- Will you have a drink?
- Please.

699
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:41,340
To you.

700
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:45,300
Cheers.

701
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:50,340
No, miss.

702
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,100
I need to speak to my aunt,
Nadia Quemener.

703
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:54,780
- Let her go.
- Sorry.

704
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:04,900
- It's about Gwen.
- What do you want?

705
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:08,020
She spent her last evening
at your husband's agency.

706
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:09,220
Who did she leave with?

707
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:12,740
I can't help you.

708
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:15,380
If you know something,
please tell me.

709
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:17,700
I really can't help you.

710
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:22,020
Ingrid,
I can't do anything to help you.

711
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:23,020
Goodbye.

712
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:27,820
I found this in Salmon's home.
Now go, we're being watched.

713
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:42,540
Are you going fishing again?

714
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:48,060
It's difficult for everybody, Yann.
For me too.

715
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:50,260
You can't keep avoiding me.

716
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:52,540
What are we going to do now?

717
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:54,660
We kissed
and fondled each other.

718
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:56,940
I dreamt of going to sea with you.

719
00:58:57,140 --> 00:59:00,980
Now we'll trim the Christmas tree
together, and call Cecile mum?

720
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:03,780
I don't know!
At least we can try.

721
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:07,220
Try what?

722
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:10,780
I don't know.
I need you here, Yann.

723
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:14,100
Before she died,

724
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,900
Gwen spent the evening
at Quemener's agency.

725
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:21,780
- Whose is this?
- She left it at Salmon's.

726
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,220
- Who gave it to you?
- Nadia.

727
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:27,100
What does it mean?

728
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:29,940
Salmon was the last person
to see her alive.

729
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:50,220
- You're avoiding me.
- Me? Absolutely not.

730
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:53,420
You're lying and avoiding me.

731
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:56,380
Yes. I find you scary.

732
00:59:57,420 --> 01:00:00,540
You can't have it both ways.
Things come at a price.

733
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:03,940
Like the death of a 17-year-old?

734
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:08,940
What do you mean?

735
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:12,540
Gwen spent her last night
at your place.

736
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:16,220
What does that prove?

737
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:20,340
I found one of the earrings
she had on that night under your bed.

738
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:23,260
I know I shouldn't be
telling you this.

739
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:25,980
It's serious.
I'm going to see Marleau.

740
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:28,260
No. You can't do that.

741
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:32,220
How are you going to stop me?
Are you going to kill me too?

742
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:34,140
- Give me the earring.
- I don't have it.

743
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:36,940
- Where is it?
- I'll die before I tell you!

744
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:41,420
In case something happened to me,
I left an account with my lawyer.

745
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:45,860
If I get into trouble,
you're my accomplice.

746
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:01,540
What are you doing?

747
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:03,380
I've filled her up.

748
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:06,980
You off again?

749
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:10,540
I've hired someone.
We'll set off tomorrow morning.

750
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:12,420
- Will you be OK?
- Yeah.

751
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:14,220
Cecile...

752
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:17,700
- I'm proud of you.
- Renan...

753
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:21,420
meet my future skipper,
Stephane Petitjean.

754
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:24,140
- Hello.
- Hello.

755
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:27,260
- Watch over her.
- I will!

756
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:45,540
I'm sorry, my son should be here.

757
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:47,100
Ah, youngsters...

758
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:49,860
He probably stayed over
at a girlfriend's.

759
01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:52,860
He phoned to tell me
he wouldn't be coming home

760
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:54,660
but he didn't say where he'd be.

761
01:02:54,860 --> 01:02:56,380
I know the feeling.

762
01:02:56,580 --> 01:02:59,660
It's hard to let our kids
fly the nest.

763
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:02,300
My eldest is the same,
and yet he's of age.

764
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:03,500
So is Yann.

765
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:06,140
- Is your son called Yann?
- Yes.

766
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:08,540
That's funny.
Mine's called Yannick.

767
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:12,660
- A real hothead.
- Like my son.

768
01:03:12,860 --> 01:03:14,420
Ah, kids!

769
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:17,140
They drive us up the wall!

770
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:20,860
That's just the way it is.

771
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:23,860
Don't worry,
we'll cope fine without him.

772
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:27,820
OK. I'm sure you're right.
I'll call him when we get back.

773
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:28,820
Let's go.

774
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:03,100
Neither lord nor master
nor kibble

775
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:21,420
Well, don't mind us!

776
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:26,060
So, did you see him?

777
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:27,940
Answer me!

778
01:04:29,180 --> 01:04:32,140
I went to Salmon's
and I was hit on the head.

779
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:35,260
- I wanted to talk to him.
- So?

780
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:37,140
I got a blow to the head!

781
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:39,260
I can't remember anything!

782
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:41,940
And I missed the trawler.

783
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:43,140
Who cares?

784
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:45,340
I'm fed up of your shit.

785
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:48,660
If you want to do this on the quiet,
count me out.

786
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:50,380
I'm going to the cops.

787
01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:52,060
You coming?

788
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:58,140
Yeah! Just a minute.

789
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:00,420
Come in.

790
01:05:03,260 --> 01:05:06,260
Come in. I don't bite
and I'm not hungry.

791
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:08,700
What's up?

792
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:10,020
I'm listening.

793
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:12,780
- I was knocked out.
- He woke up in a ditch.

794
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:15,100
After Gwen died,

795
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:18,060
I saw Nadia Quemener and Salmon
making love.

796
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:21,260
Nadia gave me this.
It belonged to Gwen.

797
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:22,740
That's familiar.

798
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:26,140
I found the other one
on her body.

799
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:29,260
Right, guys...
Sit down, take a deep breath,

800
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:31,700
and tell me everything
from the start.

801
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:33,340
Come on, wake up!

802
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:42,260
Coffee?

803
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:45,100
- Yes please, Cecile.
- OK.

804
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:05,060
Stay tuned
for the special weather report.

805
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:08,660
Strong gale to storm-force warnings
in the South-West,

806
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:10,940
force 9 to 10,

807
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:13,140
with gusts reaching 70 to 80...

808
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:14,500
Sugar?

809
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:16,260
For Christ's sake!

810
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:19,420
Why didn't you come and tell me this
before now?

811
01:06:19,820 --> 01:06:21,940
Let's go. Come on!

812
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:23,300
Hurry up!

813
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:24,860
Ah, kids...

814
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:17,420
Nobody.

815
01:07:23,060 --> 01:07:26,300
Right. Salmon isn't home.
This is what we'll do:

816
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:29,220
I'll search the premises
with my colleagues.

817
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:33,300
You stay here and hide.
If he comes, sound the horn.

818
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:35,820
Don't move,
and no smoking in my car!

819
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:47,660
What are you doing?

820
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:50,220
I'm coming.

821
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:15,300
Excuse me.
Do you know Cecile Prigent?

822
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:20,020
Yes. She's out at sea.

823
01:08:20,220 --> 01:08:23,300
Shit. I'm late,
but it's not my fault.

824
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:24,300
I got a call.

825
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:28,020
They said my kid was ill,
so I dashed to his house.

826
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:30,460
- And?
- He was fast asleep.

827
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:33,460
I think somebody
played a trick on me,

828
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:36,180
or didn't want me to take the job.

829
01:08:36,340 --> 01:08:37,460
What job?

830
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:40,020
Skipper on the trawler.

831
01:08:40,940 --> 01:08:44,020
- The skipper left with her.
- I doubt it!

832
01:08:44,260 --> 01:08:46,140
Here's the paperwork.

833
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:50,540
- You're Stephane Petitjean?
- Yes.

834
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:53,740
I don't believe it!

835
01:10:08,940 --> 01:10:10,060
Cecile!

836
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:15,420
Oh, no! Shit!

837
01:10:19,660 --> 01:10:21,140
Nothing in here.

838
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:25,980
That's strange.

839
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:31,740
Watch this.

840
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:36,580
I knew it!

841
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:38,900
The Dunkirk Carnival!

842
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:42,140
It's full of disguises.

843
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:45,740
He looks like Jacques Dutronc.

844
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:48,340
He never seems to age.

845
01:10:48,580 --> 01:10:49,700
He's an oddball.

846
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:55,300
When do you think he was born?

847
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,420
This says 1962.

848
01:10:57,620 --> 01:11:00,140
These are false papers.

849
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:02,140
What do you think?
He looks 30.

850
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:03,580
It could be Faust.

851
01:11:03,780 --> 01:11:05,340
It's not false, it's true.

852
01:11:05,540 --> 01:11:07,420
Faust, who sold his soul

853
01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:10,740
to the devil in exchange for
youth, money and beauty.

854
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:13,180
Never heard of him?

855
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:16,060
I have.
I'm a cop but I'm not ignorant.

856
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:17,460
Do your job,

857
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:21,340
instead of parading your culture
like a prize poodle.

858
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:26,740
It stinks of money here.
I can smell it.

859
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:36,180
- I'll come.
- Are you her husband?

860
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:38,300
No... Well, yes.

861
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:39,740
I'm coming too.

862
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:52,620
1, 2, 3.

863
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:58,300
Goodness! Look at that.

864
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:01,620
Have you ever seen any?
There's loads of them.

865
01:12:01,780 --> 01:12:03,900
That's good for us.
You know why?

866
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:06,060
It means Salmon will come back.

867
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:07,580
Unless he's run off.

868
01:12:07,780 --> 01:12:12,500
No. You need loads of dough
to do a runner. Loads!

869
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:14,620
He needs his money right now.

870
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:16,900
That worked out well.
Great!

871
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:21,300
Found anything?

872
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:22,940
Not yet.

873
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:26,060
- There's something there.
- Show me.

874
01:12:26,780 --> 01:12:28,340
I looked up there.

875
01:12:30,940 --> 01:12:32,620
We'll just wait for him.

876
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:38,340
Hello, ma'am.

877
01:12:41,060 --> 01:12:42,580
What happened?

878
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:46,060
They've found Gwen's prints
at Salmon's place, and blood.

879
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:49,620
Shit... Where is he?
I can't reach him.

880
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:53,060
He's run off, of course!
With all his secrets!

881
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:57,020
- He's not left anything?
- Only a body.

882
01:12:58,180 --> 01:13:01,780
No, I mean... I don't know.
A message for me?

883
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:04,780
Are you deaf?
He killed Gwen!

884
01:13:04,940 --> 01:13:07,420
And you want a goodbye note?
Honestly...

885
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:08,620
I'll call him.

886
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:13,300
- Straight to voicemail.
- Obviously!

887
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:15,900
You think he wants
to end up in jail?

888
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:26,780
I was sure he loved me.

889
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:33,220
Pick up...

890
01:13:45,980 --> 01:13:48,580
I'm looking for
Mr Renan de Kersaint-Gilly.

891
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:50,340
Yes, he's next door.

892
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:03,860
I've come to wait with you.

893
01:14:06,340 --> 01:14:08,580
I'm sorry for everything I've done.

894
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:17,060
- But I did it for you.
- I know.

895
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:55,740
- What are you doing?
- Clearing off.

896
01:14:56,660 --> 01:15:00,380
You can't go like that, Vincent.
You can't leave me.

897
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:01,820
What'll become of me?

898
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:04,380
- Stop!
- Get off me!

899
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:11,540
Get him!

900
01:15:11,780 --> 01:15:14,220
Go on, lock him up!

901
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:15,780
Off you go!

902
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:23,060
Good work, guys!

903
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:25,620
I'm sure he loves me.

904
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:28,500
I know it.

905
01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:38,820
Mr President,
Etienne Quemener here.

906
01:15:39,060 --> 01:15:42,460
My agency is closing down.
Yes, I'm filing for bankruptcy.

907
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:45,500
No, we won't be able to
carry out the work.

908
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:47,860
We'll be able to breathe
the sea air.

909
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:49,540
Yes, breathe!

910
01:15:49,780 --> 01:15:51,780
We're suffocating here!

911
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:53,340
Suffocating!

912
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:55,460
FOR SALE

913
01:16:01,660 --> 01:16:04,220
I wanted to tell you
something about him.

914
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:07,340
He wasn't always an old fool.

915
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:10,020
Sometimes, but not always.

916
01:16:10,940 --> 01:16:12,660
We even had some good times.

917
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:17,900
We met on a boat.
I'd been sick as a dog.

918
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:21,820
He pretended not to notice,
and you were born 2 years later.

919
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:24,220
He was so happy to have a son.

920
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:27,180
He played with you a lot.
Do you remember?

921
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:28,900
- No.
- Oh, he did.

922
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:31,940
One day, he'd made you a toy,
a little car.

923
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:35,220
But he wasn't good with his hands.
Boy, did I laugh!

924
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:39,500
It just looked like... an old crate.

925
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:43,180
So I told you that it was a magic box

926
01:16:43,340 --> 01:16:47,980
that you shouldn't open because
a magical creature lived inside.

927
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:52,060
It would die if I opened the box,
and I had to feed it secrets.

928
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:54,220
They would make him grow.

929
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:56,460
- I remember.
- Yes...

930
01:16:56,660 --> 01:17:01,060
I'd invented that for you to feel
less lonely, as a little boy here.

931
01:17:01,260 --> 01:17:03,340
And for him, too,

932
01:17:03,540 --> 01:17:05,260
to salvage his gift.

933
01:17:06,980 --> 01:17:08,460
And that box...

934
01:17:09,740 --> 01:17:12,020
you kept it
all through your childhood.

935
01:17:13,660 --> 01:17:17,420
I always pictured that animal
as a little blue fish.

936
01:17:17,660 --> 01:17:20,340
If I didn't speak to it,
it would become transparent,

937
01:17:20,540 --> 01:17:24,060
about to disappear,
so I'd whisper a few secrets to it.

938
01:17:24,220 --> 01:17:25,700
And it turned blue again.

939
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:30,220
That's funny.
In my mind, it was a unicorn.

940
01:17:34,060 --> 01:17:35,540
You know, this estate...

941
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:40,940
When I first saw it,
I thought I would...

942
01:17:41,660 --> 01:17:45,500
die here.
That this was where I would die.

943
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:49,340
Well...

944
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:53,540
I got that right.

945
01:18:41,540 --> 01:18:43,780
Don't worry, I'll look after him.

946
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:45,420
Come back soon.

947
01:18:47,220 --> 01:18:48,780
I've got a good reason to.

948
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:03,100
- Ready?
- Hell yes!

949
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:44,540
I may be the heir,
but this money is worthless

950
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:46,100
if I don't have love!

951
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:49,700
You have power and money.
Is that not enough?

952
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:52,380
I have to confess a terrible secret.

953
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:53,660
What, John?

954
01:20:53,860 --> 01:20:56,220
Steven's been unfaithful for years.

955
01:20:56,420 --> 01:20:59,420
That's not possible.
He loves and respects me.

956
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:00,780
Look at this ring.

957
01:21:00,980 --> 01:21:04,140
No! Listen to me, Cynthia.

958
01:21:04,340 --> 01:21:05,740
I'm busy.

959
01:21:05,980 --> 01:21:09,940
He stole Christopher's identity
and emptied his bank accounts.

960
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:11,580
You're kidding!

961
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:37,380
As you know,
I have always striven

962
01:21:37,580 --> 01:21:41,740
to protect the sea and the fishermen,

963
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:44,100
to protect them,
come hell or high water.

964
01:21:54,740 --> 01:21:56,100
Ferdinand!

965
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:01,260
Ferdinand.

966
01:22:03,860 --> 01:22:05,940
What are you doing here?

967
01:22:06,140 --> 01:22:08,740
There's no room in jail
while I'm on remand.

968
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:10,900
The prisons are full.

969
01:22:11,140 --> 01:22:14,140
My trial won't take place
for a couple of years.

970
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:15,380
In the meantime...

971
01:22:15,540 --> 01:22:17,300
You've got time for a drink.

972
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:18,660
Yes.

973
01:22:21,220 --> 01:22:23,220
- They released you?
- Yes.

974
01:22:24,260 --> 01:22:25,460
Unbelievable!

975
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:28,820
- Extraordinary!
- Yes.

976
01:22:29,860 --> 01:22:33,620
I heard that Salmon and the man
who attacked Cecile were dead.

977
01:22:33,860 --> 01:22:35,620
Yes, they were both shot.

978
01:22:35,860 --> 01:22:40,100
Salmon when he was taken to prison,
the other one in his hospital bed.

979
01:22:40,260 --> 01:22:41,580
Two rifle shots.

980
01:22:42,860 --> 01:22:45,300
Witnesses say they saw a woman.

981
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:48,860
They've not found her.

982
01:22:49,060 --> 01:22:51,220
- Their boss?
- No, no.

983
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:56,700
Apparently, Salmon received
transfers from offshore accounts.

984
01:22:56,900 --> 01:22:59,740
They've traced
a Mr Philippe de Ville.

985
01:22:59,940 --> 01:23:03,140
The police investigated,
they even searched his home,

986
01:23:03,340 --> 01:23:06,180
but they didn't find any DNA.

987
01:23:06,380 --> 01:23:08,100
He was the devil.

988
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:11,660
- Etienne must have taken it hard.
- It was very strange.

989
01:23:11,860 --> 01:23:15,540
He wandered the streets
saying that Salmon loved him.

990
01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:18,900
Then he left town
and no one knows where he is.

991
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:20,860
But I got my clearing back.

992
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:23,180
Before vanishing, he returned it.

993
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:25,340
You've left it outside?

994
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:27,460
- It looks good there.
- Yes.

995
01:23:27,660 --> 01:23:29,660
And it's more comfortable.

996
01:23:29,860 --> 01:23:32,580
We can sit here now

997
01:23:32,780 --> 01:23:35,060
and see the trees in blossom.

998
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:39,740
- And the lighthouse...
- It's mine now.

999
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:42,020
It's grown on me.

1000
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:45,100
Cecile has got me involved
in a marina project

1001
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:47,540
to modernize the harbour.

1002
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:51,820
Anyway... We've launched
a major referendum.

1003
01:23:51,980 --> 01:23:54,100
She's in charge of all that.

1004
01:23:55,420 --> 01:23:57,420
The days are getting longer.

1005
01:24:00,820 --> 01:24:02,900
You can tell spring is near.

1006
01:24:06,060 --> 01:24:07,580
How long do you have?

1007
01:24:08,300 --> 01:24:10,660
- 2 years.
- 2 years? That's marvellous!

1008
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:15,260
It'll make each season
even more amazing.

1009
01:24:16,540 --> 01:24:18,540
Like an end-of-the-world feeling.

1010
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:26,020
Thank you.

1011
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:27,860
No.

1012
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:29,980
Let me thank you.

1013
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:40,140
