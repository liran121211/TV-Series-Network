00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,720
CAPTAIN MARLEAU

2
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,120
ILLUSION

3
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,040
Alex!

4
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,680
Alex, that's enough now!
It's not funny!

5
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,320
Have you seen Alex?

6
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,760
No, sorry.

7
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,960
Alex! Alex!

8
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,120
Alex!

9
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,160
Alex...

10
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,840
Alex, you scared me!

11
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,200
Come on.

12
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,320
Come, Alex.

13
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,720
LEO

14
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,160
Fine... Fine, but

15
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,040
could you move it
towards me a little...

16
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,960
and a bit more in front?

17
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,040
Sorry to ask you that now, but...

18
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,040
-Mrs. Garin?
-Yes?

19
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,480
Are the garlands okay?

20
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,600
Yes, very nice. Put some over there,
that'll look nice.

21
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,120
-Sure.
-Thank you.

22
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,400
Brilliant, Cédric! Really!

23
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,760
You had me fooled
right the way through.

24
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,560
I never saw it coming.

25
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,440
I never guessed the culprit.

26
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,320
Very good.

27
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,680
I'm delighted, but you...

28
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,280
Why can't you be less formal with me?

29
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,280
I'd rather be formal
if unpleasant things are to be said.

30
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,480
You've got unpleasant things to say?

31
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,160
No. But you do.

32
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,320
What don't you like
about my manuscript?

33
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,920
Nothing, nothing at all. Well...

34
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,920
two or three tiny blunders.

35
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,760
The cop breaking down near
where the murder happens,

36
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,200
I find that a bit...
a bit silly, a bit unsubtle...

37
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,480
What's up with you, honey?

38
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,840
Shit! Fuck! I don't believe this!

39
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,840
Bloody thing! Dammit!

40
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,040
Fuck, there's no signal either!
No way!

41
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,760
Hello?

42
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,040
Well, you won't get stolen.

43
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,920
Look at that!

44
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,880
At least it's not raining.
It's pretty here!

45
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,160
Hello! Anyone there?

46
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,120
Hey, my darling,
did you have fun with Elsa?

47
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,000
Okay, time for your maths lesson.

48
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,920
But, Dad, there's no school today.
It's Wednesday.

49
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,560
Other kids don't get to have
a teacher like Cédric to themselves!

50
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,000
And look at the playground you have!
Right? Off you go.

51
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,280
Go on, off you go!
Or you won't be ready for the party!

52
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,920
Shall we do this, Champ?

53
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,600
I need to talk to you.
Not here, there are too many people.

54
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,640
I thought I could trust you.

55
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,040
Why do you say that?

56
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,560
You're here as an au pair. I pay you
well, you get bed and board.

57
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,200
This is your home.

58
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,880
But we said "no visits". Remember?

59
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,920
Where do you two meet?
In your bedroom?

60
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,440
In Marc's studio.

61
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,480
When he's out recording his stuff.

62
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,760
You really disappoint me, Elsa.

63
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,040
I'm sorry.

64
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,360
You know I'm fond of you,

65
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,800
so sort it out by tonight. Okay?

66
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,720
Another mid-life crisis?

67
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,080
Leave me alone.
It's not your problem.

68
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,800
Well, it is a bit, isn't it?

69
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,640
-Do you have a sister?
-No.

70
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,440
Then I have no use for you.

71
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,640
Bunch of idiots!

72
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,760
Fucking idiots...

73
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,760
I'm sick of this!

74
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,040
Stop!

75
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,480
Police, good evening.

76
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,640
Nice to see that some people
still care about others at this time.

77
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,800
Right, I'm getting in the back.

78
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,600
Hi, doggies. Okay, off we go!

79
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,040
Right, Auntie Marleau's getting out.

80
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,920
There we go.

81
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,080
Right, goodbye, girls! Bye!

82
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:36,480
CAFÉ
THE WHITE CROSS

83
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,920
-Good evening.
-Evening.

84
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,760
I'm sorry, I smell of mutts.

85
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,640
What a nice place! My God!

86
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,480
Not many folk about. It's quiet.

87
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,480
Yup, the rats have abandoned ship.

88
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,080
Gilles Garin's giving a party,

89
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,360
so they're all there.

90
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,760
Garin? Who is Gilles Garin?

91
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,520
Never heard of Gilles Garin?

92
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,480
The famous crime novelist?
The "Master of Thrills"?

93
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,800
Crime novels are rubbish,
I prefer romance.

94
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,080
It's more realistic.

95
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,920
I've got all the "Mills and Boons".
Could I get a small beer?

96
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,640
Just a tiny wee snifter.

97
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,360
Ta.

98
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,080
How come you're not at the do?

99
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,920
Don't you like pen-pushers?

100
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,920
Yes, but not all of them.
Are you eating?

101
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,200
And sleeping.
Do you have any rooms?

102
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,400
Yes.

103
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,800
Are the local mechanics
at his Majesty's bash as well?

104
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,040
I'll make you some food.

105
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,880
That's kind of you!

106
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,320
Stop, that's enough now.

107
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,600
What's wrong, Sir,
this is a party, isn't it?

108
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,200
My dear friends!

109
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,600
How lovely it is to see you all here

110
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,320
with us:

111
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,080
Alex, my son, the love of my life,

112
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,240
Judith, my wife,

113
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,040
the other love of my life,
and my publisher.

114
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,760
So please don't tell her
my next book isn't finished yet.

115
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,360
I'm counting on you.
Otherwise, I'll be in trouble.

116
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,880
As you know,
I don't go in for long speeches,

117
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,160
I prefer the pen.

118
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,640
I'll be brief,
since I haven't prepared a speech.

119
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,320
Today is a... special day for me.

120
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,960
For all of us.

121
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,160
And I thought
today's date would be perfect

122
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,800
for launching a...
special project too.

123
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,320
You see, I think that each one of us,
each one of you,

124
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,880
can become a writer.

125
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,320
I think
that everyone has something to say,

126
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,680
an imagination, a story to tell.

127
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,360
So, I have created a foundation:

128
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,320
The...

129
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,960
Alex...

130
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,200
and Leo Foundation.

131
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,080
Each year,

132
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:17,240
this foundation will propose
a short story competition.

133
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,080
On whatever subject you like.

134
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,200
Love, revenge, murder, bereavement...

135
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,480
It is up to you. You decide.

136
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,800
And the winner...

137
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,480
The...

138
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,600
What's with Garin?

139
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,600
Leo died four years ago.

140
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,080
The winner will receive 3,000 euros

141
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,040
and have the privilege
of being helped...

142
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,760
by "the Master of Thrills"

143
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,240
to finish his or her story,
which my company shall publish.

144
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,760
But I think you all know about that.

145
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,320
Party time!

146
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,960
What's that? Fireworks? I love 'em!

147
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,760
The pen-pusher's do?

148
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,320
For sure. That kind of power play
has to be him!

149
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:23,080
You're not very receptive to
the charms of literature, my friend.

150
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,960
Let's say I prefer charm
to be a bit more discreet.

151
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,400
I'm the opposite.
I like trashy stuff,

152
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,760
kitschy, ugly stuff.
Like your lamp over there.

153
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,320
What's wrong with my lamp?

154
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,320
It's nice, I like it.

155
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,480
It was my mother's.

156
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:40,640
Sorry.

157
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,960
Strange
that Elsa didn't come to the party.

158
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,200
Shall we see if she's okay?

159
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,480
No, we can't disturb her
at this hour. It's far too late.

160
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,400
I'm sure she's fine. Don't worry.

161
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,240
Shit! Unbelievable!

162
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,760
Hello? What?

163
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,360
No, no, I'm out jogging.

164
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,840
Yeah. So she's dead, so what?

165
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,800
I'll be there later. Yup, bye.

166
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,480
They're getting on my tits.

167
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,360
Lieutenant Tahar.

168
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,360
Garin.

169
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,640
She was part of the family.

170
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,400
I have some questions to ask you.

171
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,480
No need to go easy on me,
Lieutenant.

172
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,200
I don't know much anyway.

173
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,480
When was the last time
you saw the victim?

174
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,840
She felt poorly last night,
she went to bed at 7 p.m.

175
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,400
She wasn't at breakfast,

176
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,400
so I went to see her...

177
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,480
I'll call the police chief in Lille,

178
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,480
he's a friend.
He'll spare no expense.

179
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,760
Out here, us gendarmes are competent.

180
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,520
I've called Forensics.
They're sending someone over.

181
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,240
I'm on the force: Captain Marleau.

182
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,640
This is you?

183
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,840
Yes, before the operation.
I used to be called Bernard.

184
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,360
Ta!

185
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,720
What's with you?

186
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,360
Where is it?

187
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,360
Who are you?

188
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,960
Undertakers' customer care agent.

189
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,640
-Which way?
-First floor.

190
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,440
-First floor?
-Yeah.

191
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,280
I'd say she died last night
between 9 p.m. and 11 p.m.

192
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,080
Hello, ladies and gents!
Captain Marleau.

193
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,280
So what's happened?

194
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,720
Lieutenant Tahar.
I've just rung the unit.

195
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,960
How did you get here so quickly?

196
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,200
I can run the 400 m
in under 5 minutes 30.

197
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,080
So, preliminary findings?

198
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,400
Rigor mortis,
what d'you reckon, mate?

199
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,920
Garin, Gilles Garin.

200
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,400
I am...
Well, I was this girl's employer.

201
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,000
She looked after my son.

202
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,960
Ah, so you're our famous writer?

203
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,840
You hosted that bash last night
for the village?

204
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,960
With the bangers, concerts, etc,

205
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,280
nasty smokescreen
for a murder, right?

206
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,360
What do you mean?

207
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,840
You think I staged a smokescreen?

208
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,520
No...
But please undershtand, dear shir,

209
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,960
I never imply anything.
Even under torture.

210
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,640
Down with irony!

211
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,800
I was simply saying reality
is sometimes fucked up.

212
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,920
For example, a writer might be
after inspiration for his next book.

213
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,120
And it turns out rotten
for a kid like her.

214
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,080
I might ring my friend in Lille...

215
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,960
Better to be safe than sorry.

216
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,880
No, definitely not.
Lille is out with this jurisdiction.

217
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,640
Thank you, Lieutenant.

218
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,120
Do what you like,
but stay off my crime scene.

219
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,240
You'll dirty it.

220
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,960
I did actually take precautions.

221
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,920
When I found the body,
I stayed in the doorway.

222
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,480
I know the procedure.

223
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,360
Ah, you're a meticulous man.
I love that!

224
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,720
Great. Well, since we have
the circumstances,

225
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,920
could we talk about the...
protagonists in this story?

226
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,680
That's what you call them, right?

227
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,080
For example,
might someone hold something

228
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,800
against this girl?

229
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,800
I don't know. No.

230
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,440
Elsa had no past.
She was my best friend's daughter.

231
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,040
Before he died,
I promised I'd look after her.

232
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,400
We're her only relatives.

233
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,240
So she didn't even have
an old sugar daddy somewhere?

234
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,120
-No.
-No?

235
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,840
No. No one. Only us.
If I can help you...

236
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,600
Ah, that's so kind of you. Thank you.

237
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,720
You could help by leaving the room.

238
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,960
It's nothing personal...

239
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,680
but when I have a star like you
in front of me...

240
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,720
I lose my cool... I don't know...

241
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,080
I won't be able to work.

242
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,840
Okay, as you wish.

243
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,320
Well, I remain
at your disposal, of course.

244
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,440
I'm going to blush.

245
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,000
Thank you, Boss.

246
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,560
Wasn't he going a bit over the top?

247
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,120
"The poor kitten is dead."

248
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,960
Acting like Robert Hirsch,
Isabelle Adjani, right?

249
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,920
Right then, it's up to us three.

250
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,800
It's hot, isn't it?

251
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,360
So, the victim's called Elsa Floriot
and she was 22.

252
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,000
Yeah... Elsa Floriot, 22 years old.

253
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,320
Look at these!

254
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,720
Do they suit me?

255
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,560
Well, I... I...

256
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,040
Yeah, okay...

257
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,960
Here, this is nuts, see it?

258
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,200
The underwear is very...
But the outerwear...

259
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,800
is rather... right?

260
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,600
Yes, definitely. Yes.

261
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,360
I wonder who she allowed

262
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,600
to look beneath the appearances?

263
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,720
She was a little devil, right?
I like her!

264
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,720
It'll be okay, my darling.
Let me give you a hug.

265
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,360
I want Dad!

266
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,240
What's wrong?

267
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,720
He's crying, I wanted to comfort him,
he pushed me away.

268
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,960
He'll only see you.

269
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,400
It'll pass. It'll pass...

270
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,720
You've said that for four years
and it hasn't.

271
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,560
I can't take the rejection.

272
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,840
What have I done?

273
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Nothing. Nothing at all.

274
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,800
Just that you're Leo's mother.

275
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,840
That's true...

276
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,360
I feel like I lost him when his...

277
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,760
when his brother died.

278
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,800
It wasn't my fault.

279
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,240
I can't do anything
if he's always upset with me.

280
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,400
He's not upset with you.
Quite the opposite.

281
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,960
He can't bear your pain. Understand?

282
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,480
I've overcome it.

283
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,680
I overcame it for him!

284
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,760
Yes, but he doesn't know that.

285
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,040
I'll talk to him, I promise.

286
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,600
Thank you.

287
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,320
Apparently, a detective's here?

288
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,160
Two of them, two gendarmes.

289
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,920
The first looks like
a virtuous, former soldier.

290
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:32,440
And the second...
I have no words to describe her.

291
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,400
Bang!

292
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,520
Was I good?

293
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,840
The scream was a bit...
Well, the rest was okay.

294
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,200
"A bit"? Look at this!

295
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,360
This is clearly
not a house for pretty flowers.

296
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,520
Captain? Bullet came from a 9 mm.

297
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,000
Let's see.

298
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,800
Hollow-point bullet,

299
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,600
maximum velocity,
to do maximum damage.

300
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,680
That's why the bullet went through.

301
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,520
This is military ammo.

302
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,440
Wow, you know your stuff!

303
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,640
I did ten years in the Paras
before joining the gendarmerie.

304
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,000
I knew a Para once:
Corporal Babazoule.

305
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,480
Would you get this ammunition
at a local gunsmith?

306
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,560
Definitely not.

307
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,080
You need to move your queen.
Otherwise, I'll take you again.

308
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,000
Yoohoo! Hello!

309
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,680
So, are you Alex, then?

310
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,120
Is that Davy Crockett's hat?

311
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,840
No, it's not,
it's a cat that I stuffed.

312
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,600
Listen, I'm not sure
this is the right moment.

313
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,320
Okay. If you're a good boy,

314
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,680
I'll stuff one just for you.
But you must tell me about Elsa.

315
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,280
What? Doesn't he like cats?

316
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,960
You can't talk to him like that!

317
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,520
Alex is shocked by her death.

318
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,040
Plus, four years ago yesterday,
his twin brother drowned in the lake.

319
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,120
How nasty!
Shit, I didn't know, I'm sorry.

320
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,800
Alex has never got over it.
And now Elsa...

321
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,960
I understand. And who are you?

322
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,320
I'm Alex's tutor.

323
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,600
"Shooter", right?

324
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,720
Very funny. I know it's not common,
but that's how it is.

325
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,520
I teach him and I write.

326
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,320
You're a novelist?

327
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,160
That's interesting.
I need an expert's advice.

328
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,080
Don't you think
it's an incredible coincidence

329
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,040
that the babysitter is killed
on the anniversary

330
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,040
of the brother's death?

331
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,160
Life is more incredible than novels.

332
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,400
What beautiful words...
Deeper than a gorge.

333
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,200
Cédric!

334
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,160
The Child Divine has spoken.

335
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,280
Cédric! Come back!

336
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,960
Go play in the woods, oboes play,
set bagpipes sounding!

337
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,280
No one ever listens to me anyway...

338
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,320
Yoohoo!

339
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,120
Wow! It's pretty in here!

340
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,200
Looks like Indiana Jones' office.

341
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,040
You water
those old plants every day, right?

342
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,200
Yes.

343
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,160
Do you polish
all that stuff up there too?

344
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,200
No, only Sir
is allowed to touch them.

345
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,760
Only Sir, right?

346
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,840
Where does Sir practice?
On the grounds?

347
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,000
He doesn't shoot!

348
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,040
You must be our Miss Marple?

349
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,920
And you must be an artist, right?

350
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,040
Everyone is, here.

351
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,600
Marc Durieux.

352
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,360
I wear several hats:

353
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,600
I'm the master's brother-in-law,

354
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,480
a resident,
and experimental musician.

355
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,600
And what do you "experimentalize"?

356
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,120
Tap your foot at a steady beat.

357
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,920
Go on, go on.

358
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,560
Fascinating, I love it!

359
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,480
Hey, how come Gilles

360
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,840
has an arsenal like that
if he never uses it?

361
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,040
Because any worthy crime novelist

362
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,520
has to have a gun collection.

363
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,400
He also has a car,
but he doesn't drive,

364
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,440
a computer,
but he writes by hand.

365
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,480
He paid for the school repairs
but his son doesn't attend.

366
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,480
Why?

367
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,320
Isn't it good enough for him?

368
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,560
And when he writes novels, does he
kill folk or is this an exception?

369
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,560
In my experience,
he's more mouth than action.

370
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,640
Okay. I wanted to show you something.

371
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,120
Ever seen these before?

372
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,520
They're not my size, sorry.

373
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,120
Let me see.

374
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,760
No, not your color either!

375
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,800
Elsa's color though.

376
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,360
Did Elsa Floriot
have a boyfriend or girlfriend?

377
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,960
She always looked after Alex.
She hardly ever left the property,

378
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,680
she had to be on hand:

379
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,760
Gilles' orders.

380
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,120
I understand, it's so hard
to get good Filipino staff,

381
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,200
available 24 hours a day,

382
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,480
and undocumented workers at that too.

383
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,240
Tell me, your master crime writer,

384
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,240
I think he likes
all his courtiers around him, right?

385
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,200
Maybe we inspire him?

386
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,720
Do you ever knock?

387
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,760
There's no point.

388
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,680
I always end up getting in anyway.

389
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,520
Ah, a clock like Granny Zazane has!
Is there a cuckoo in it?

390
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,120
Not in that model.

391
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,640
How stupid.
I like it when things are hidden.

392
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,400
It reminds me of my childhood.

393
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,880
You have three clocks!

394
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,080
Yes, I do.

395
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,720
Is this the Football World Cup?

396
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,080
It's not really from the same era.

397
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,320
My offer of help still stands.

398
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,160
Yeah?

399
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,880
Yes, I'm not a total novice,

400
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:47,840
I've done internships at the DRPJ
in Paris, Scotland Yard...

401
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,440
Wow! You speak English then?

402
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,840
-Not really.
-Me neither.

403
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,760
I trained later in life,
in my family.

404
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,280
My aunt killed my uncle:

405
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,880
incest
in an ostensibly respectable family.

406
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,840
Well, anyway, going back to Elsa:

407
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,560
I have a theory.
Are you interested?

408
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,400
Go ahead! No need to be shy.

409
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,080
It is pretty simple.

410
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,880
The murder occurred while everyone
was outside at the party.

411
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,720
A thief made the most of that,
but ran into Elsa.

412
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,480
He panicked, shot her...

413
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,920
And the gunshot couldn't be heard
over the fireworks.

414
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,760
That's pretty poor, really!

415
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,960
You can do better.

416
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,600
Plus, that's impossible.

417
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,000
-Do you know why?
-No.

418
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,880
Come along, I'll show you.

419
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,400
I saw that!
You've started smoking again, right?

420
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,240
No, I've just quit.

421
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,800
Yeah, yeah. Come and see this.

422
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,160
It's much classier

423
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:54,600
using a Smith & Wesson Model 10
than a SIG Sauer to kill someone!

424
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,120
I dunno, I've never tried.

425
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,000
So why do you have so many guns?

426
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:03,080
All these weapons were held
by people who once used them.

427
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:07,160
I like to imagine their characters,
lives, reasons for killing.

428
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,880
It helps me create my characters.

429
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,080
And could I see...

430
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,400
Your Swiss Army Luger?
Or is that too private?

431
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,400
Who said I had one?

432
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,680
A bullet hole.

433
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,760
Excuse me?

434
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,600
The bullet that killed Elsa.

435
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:27,360
It came from a military weapon

436
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,480
made between 1904 and 1947, it seems.

437
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,720
I'd happily bet
that it used to be on your display...

438
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,920
Looks like you've just won your bet.

439
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,640
You were right.

440
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,080
But I can't see a burglar
taking the Luger

441
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,440
without knowing the manor.

442
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,640
Yes, he would have to know

443
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,720
where the keysie-weezie was.

444
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,000
So it must be
someone from the household.

445
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,720
This collection is no secret.

446
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,600
Given all the people
that were at the party,

447
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,640
God knows
who could've got in here.

448
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,600
Your little do
happened at just the right time.

449
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,560
For the murderer, I mean.

450
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,120
Wait! Wait, no, I've an idea.

451
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,840
France 3 and Cédric
filmed us all night long.

452
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,520
The video may reveal something.

453
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,840
Yeah, that's a great idea!

454
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
If someone from the village did it,

455
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,840
that means a lot of suspects.

456
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,600
Three hundred and ninety exactly.

457
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,400
390! The catering
must have been expensive!

458
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,840
Out of those 390 people,
might one of the men or women

459
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,120
have worn this type of thing?

460
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,440
-No?
-I don't know. No.

461
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,760
Too bad, I'll give them to Tahar.

462
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:54,120
Another annoying thing is
that we haven't found Elsa's mobile.

463
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,640
That's normal. She didn't have one.

464
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,880
Really?

465
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,240
Youngsters need phones
like shareholders need redundancies.

466
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,080
Yes, but I banned her
from having one here.

467
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,200
I don't want my son
touching ultra-connected devices.

468
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,160
The waves are bad for the brain.

469
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,360
Not as bad as a bullet though.

470
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,840
Do you have children?

471
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,040
What for?

472
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,480
Well then, I can do
without your expertise on the matter.

473
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,360
I don't care:
I'm for everyone being sterilized.

474
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,080
Know what I'd like you to do?
Get all the fingerprints:

475
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,640
from the gun display, drawer, key.

476
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,520
Then, seal off the gun room, okay?

477
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,120
Also, get the video of the party.

478
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,080
Ask France 3, they'll send it to you.

479
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:44,160
And ask thingummy's family at
the enchanted manor for their video.

480
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,000
I'd like to see it.

481
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,440
And the murder weapon?

482
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,240
Six feet under.

483
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,560
-What?
-In the grounds or in the lake.

484
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,760
Shall I get divers?

485
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,720
No, do that, get my car fixed,
and find me another.

486
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,760
And not a police car: I'm discreet.

487
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,160
The key of your car, please.
Come on.

488
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,760
Thanks, poppet.

489
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,240
Looks like you're popular.

490
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,400
Yes, did you hear
what the captain said?

491
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,120
Seal off the gun room. Okay?

492
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,640
-See you tomorrow, Fanny!
-Bye, Albert.

493
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,400
...raped and beaten up.
The cook's friend told me.

494
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,760
She was probably
tortured with a knife.

495
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,040
Who could've done it?

496
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:32,000
Well, if there's a sadist
at large in the village,

497
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,160
I'm not letting my kids go out!

498
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,840
Who said it was a sadist?

499
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,800
Yes, and maybe the girl
wasn't as clean as all that.

500
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,120
Sometimes, you reap what you sow.

501
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,720
It'll make a good story
for Garin's contest.

502
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,240
God knows. It could just be

503
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,240
a publicity stunt for his next book.

504
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,480
It's happened before.

505
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,200
That's enough! Will you all shut up?

506
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,920
You know nothing,
so shut your mouths!

507
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,040
Show some respect.
The kid's dead.

508
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,920
My niece works
at the Gendarmerie switchboard:

509
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,520
seems like they've sent us
a champion detective.

510
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,720
Hello, ladies and gents.
Gendarmerie.

511
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,000
It'd be quite good here. Fanny?

512
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,080
Could I get a small table
to use as a desk?

513
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,120
-Of course.
-Thank you.

514
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,040
Some champion!

515
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,840
We are the champions...

516
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,960
Jogging makes me hungry!

517
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,320
Fanny, could you put this on my tab?

518
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,640
Yes.

519
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,200
There you are!

520
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,840
When you cleaned my room,
my book fell on the floor

521
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,720
and it was open on its spine!

522
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,160
Is that a problem?

523
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,280
Yes, it is!

524
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,480
That is Gilles Garin's first novel,
with the original cover!

525
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,240
He was 28 when it came out!

526
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,640
He still lived
in Rue des Archives, Paris!

527
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,920
That book is priceless.
Do you see the problem now?

528
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,080
Let's discuss it in my room, okay?

529
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,920
I'm also part of his fan club.
In Bousbecque.

530
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,560
I'm the only member.

531
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,000
You're not the cleaner?

532
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,280
No, not really. Well, yes, sometimes
I'm sent in to pick up the rubbish.

533
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,560
Police. Step into my office.

534
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,400
Smells bad in here, right?

535
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,560
Were you at Garin's party last night?

536
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,920
That must've been fun
for a fan like you.

537
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,560
I wasn't invited.

538
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,880
Really? That's strange.
You know someone was murdered?

539
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,280
No, not him. He is full of beans.

540
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,920
Unlike his babysitter.
Did you know Elsa Floriot?

541
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:53,200
Elsa? Yes... Well, no!

542
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,920
Why? Do you suspect me?

543
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,280
Should I?

544
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,560
I'm more interested
in Garin and his gang.

545
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,000
Garin? Don't be ridiculous!

546
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,600
Ridiculous! You're completely mad!

547
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,080
The cops will delve into our lives.

548
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,080
In detail.
You're aware of that, aren't you?

549
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,440
Yes, I write crime novels.

550
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,880
If you slept with Elsa,
I want to hear it from you, now!

551
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,440
Not from that nutter
in the Russian hat!

552
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,440
Judith, Elsa was Pierre's daughter.

553
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,520
Stop saying that!

554
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,160
Pierre's been dead for six years!

555
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,280
He won't find out!

556
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,880
Did you sleep with Elsa?

557
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,400
You're mad! You're mad!

558
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,320
Stop being so jealous! Stop it!

559
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,080
It's hurting us.
I'm not hiding anything!

560
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,240
Really? So what are those papers
you're burning?

561
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,840
Poor manuscripts.
I don't want the cops reading them.

562
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,400
Or anyone. Not even you.

563
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,280
I'm ashamed of them. Get it?

564
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,840
Listen,

565
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,000
I made a mistake, I admit that.

566
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,280
But since Leo died,

567
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,720
I haven't strayed.

568
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,400
If I find out you're lying,
I'll leave you,

569
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,520
that'll be it!

570
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,160
You'll never see me again.

571
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,680
I'm sorry.

572
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,240
All these deaths!
I can't take it any more!

573
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,840
Who did that? Shit!

574
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:32,080
I thought you'd stopped drinking?
That was the deal, right?

575
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,120
You should try.
Might do you good.

576
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,600
Marc, stop! Don't start that again.

577
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,840
No, leave it.

578
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,120
We're all on edge. Elsa's death
has been painful for everyone.

579
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,320
Especially for Alex.

580
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,320
And it's not over:
what with that nutter they've sent.

581
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,440
She's not like
any cop I've ever seen!

582
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,600
Beware of appearances.

583
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,600
She looks and talks like an idiot,

584
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,600
but she's anything but.

585
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,600
How far have you got
with your alternative music concerto?

586
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,880
Because I've already reserved
the auditorium.

587
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,160
Please respect the deadline for once.

588
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,160
Don't pressure him.
He needs peace to be creative.

589
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:12,720
You're lucky. I don't know
if you deserve this guardian angel.

590
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,600
Forgive him:

591
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,680
what with Leo and Elsa both dead,
he's a bit lost.

592
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,040
No, he's right, and you know it.
I'm a failure.

593
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,440
Be quiet.
Stop listening to yourself and work.

594
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,000
I believe in you.

595
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,040
And I love you.

596
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,160
And stop drinking.

597
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,560
What a gorgeous smell!

598
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:56,520
I'd like one in my room
because it smells of dogs.

599
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,680
Can I take that one?

600
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,560
Yes, okay.

601
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,040
That's kind of you.

602
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,960
Come on, chubby cheeks! Ta!

603
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,760
BÉNÉDICTE HARTMAN'S BODY
FOUND IN THE MEYER BREWERY

604
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:35,040
So, what books
have you had published?

605
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,680
2006, 2008, 2009, 2010,

606
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,960
2011, 2012. Is that all?

607
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,160
You've written nothing since 2012?

608
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,440
You're paid to do fuck all!

609
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,200
What bollocks!

610
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,320
Who's this?

611
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,480
Tahar? Yes, Tahar?

612
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,760
Do you mind? Calling a girl
at this hour! Know what that means?

613
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,840
I'm only joking! You don't have
a sense of humor at night, do you?

614
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,600
Yeah? I don't care what car.
As long as it works.

615
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,040
No, not an automatic!

616
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,160
That's an oik's car!
That's all there is?

617
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,040
Oh well, too bad.
Yeah, good night, ducky.

618
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,760
Fuck. It's hard being a cop.

619
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,200
What else?

620
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:29,120
"Jenny Eyes and Gilles Garin:
romance on the Basque coast."

621
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,440
She's young enough
to be his granddaughter.

622
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,400
"... ecstatic in the arms of Jenny,
25 years his junior."

623
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,480
What bollocks!

624
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,880
THE WHITE CROSS HOTEL

625
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,760
Party time!

626
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,120
-Hello.
-Hello.

627
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,200
Hello there!

628
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,840
She seems a bit strange,
the girl who just went out.

629
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,080
No. Just a bit shy, I think.

630
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,560
She's quite nice.

631
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:42,480
She's usually out all day long.
A hiker.

632
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:48,480
Tell me... I was wondering...

633
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,880
How did Elsa die, exactly?

634
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,160
Folk here are saying
all kinds of stuff.

635
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:56,200
Yeah, well, they're idiots.
Let them talk.

636
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,360
Your jam's delicious. I love it.

637
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:01,760
We all know Garin did it!
Asshole! He wanted

638
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,440
to restore the droit du seigneur
and the girl didn't agree.

639
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,720
Just shut up, Carl.

640
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,440
When I delivered wood to Garin,
I saw him eyeing her up.

641
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,600
Like the wolf in Red Hot Riding Hood.

642
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:15,200
Good morning, Nasty FM!

643
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,320
So,

644
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,040
you appear to have a nose
for sniffing out predators.

645
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,200
That interests me.

646
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,880
How does it work? When it goes red,
there's one in the area, right?

647
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,280
Mr. Carl?
May I see your I.D., please?

648
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,440
I've done nothing wrong!

649
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,880
Your I.D., I said!

650
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,600
No need for a breathalyzer, methinks!

651
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,080
However, we'll do a wee DNA test:
you never know.

652
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:39,800
I've done nothing!

653
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,760
I swear. Ask anyone, I'm innocent.

654
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,360
Never say, "I swear".

655
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:47,360
Never. It makes you look suspicious,
straightaway!

656
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,800
Unless you have proof
for what you say.

657
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,360
I'm listening, dear boy.

658
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:54,000
Did Mr. Garin kill the girl?

659
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,600
I wasn't being serious.

660
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,160
Just a bit of fun, right?

661
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,640
Hilarious. LOL!

662
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,480
Do you know what happened in WWII

663
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,720
because of gossip
and slander like that?

664
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,920
Know where they sent people?
To Compiègne, not far from here.

665
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,160
Or Drancy, if you were Jewish.

666
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:14,040
So, if you have no proof...
Maybe you are right,

667
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,480
Mr. Garin may be guilty...

668
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,760
but if you have no proof,
you shut your gob.

669
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:21,360
And stick it back
in your morning pastis! Got it?

670
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,720
-May I?
-Yes, you may.

671
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:31,040
No kidding! Tell me, do you know
where they've left my car?

672
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,760
Yes, she said, "just out there."

673
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,480
Great.
Can I leave my laptop with you?

674
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,880
I'll get it later. Thanks, honey.

675
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:41,040
Tweet, tweet! Modern!

676
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,640
Ta!

677
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,720
Captain Marleau, I was expecting you.

678
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,600
A list of all the house staff.

679
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:14,320
I was told
you've seen the party videos?

680
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,320
Thoroughly!

681
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,960
Yes, no kidding, you didn't leave
the party for a minute!

682
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,760
Neither did your mates.
Great alibi, well done.

683
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:22,880
I'm delighted.

684
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,800
I'm not. It annoys me.

685
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,920
I'm basic, I like things simple,

686
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:31,320
with an ideal suspect,
a weapon, a clear, precise alibi.

687
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,080
This is unclear! Annoying!

688
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,160
Cheer up, I have a serious lead.

689
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,760
Well, I think I have.

690
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,080
What is it?

691
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,640
Two years ago,

692
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:43,880
Judith was attacked by an erotomaniac
who'd been targeting me.

693
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:47,240
She got out of a psychiatric hospital
three weeks ago.

694
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,920
Of course,
she's subject to a restraining order,

695
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,320
but you never know with those people.

696
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,920
But why would she kill
your babysitter?

697
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,200
I don't know.

698
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,320
Maybe she decided
to lay into all the women around me?

699
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:00,880
Yeah...

700
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:05,040
Here, look. That's her.
A police friend sent me it.

701
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,800
Stay where you are.

702
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,360
And tell your wife and kid
not to leave the place, okay?

703
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,680
What's going on?

704
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,360
Tahar, send two men
to the manor right away.

705
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,360
Quick!

706
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:30,360
Send two men to the hotel
in case the crazy woman goes back.

707
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,480
She'll have a pop at Judith next!

708
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,640
Wait, I'll call you back.

709
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,040
Come down, Master Crow.

710
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,200
I was just checking they were okay.

711
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:54,760
No, that's my job!

712
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,040
Your job is to stay
at least 300 m away from the Garins.

713
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,640
That's okay, I'm 400 m away.

714
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,840
What?
Did you measure that from inside?

715
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:05,320
No. Come down
or I'll call the cavalry.

716
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,360
Blimey!

717
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,640
Yeah, Tahar.
Yeah, it's okay, I've got her.

718
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:15,920
Yeah, we're going.
Get your butt over here. Come on!

719
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,040
"Huh"? No, not you!
She went "huh"!

720
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,760
-Ladies!
-Hello.

721
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,360
Fanny, can I have my laptop?

722
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,320
Yes.

723
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,800
-And two beers too.
-Yes.

724
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,480
No, tea. A tea, please.

725
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,120
Okay.

726
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,600
Enjoy your meal!

727
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,360
I'll show you something insane!

728
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:38,200
Our favorite writer's party.

729
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,360
Ah, silly me, you were there,
of course, weren't you?

730
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,360
You're so photogenic!

731
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,080
And a bit of a liar too, right?

732
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,480
I couldn't resist it.

733
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:51,120
I lied because of the injunction.
But I did no harm.

734
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:54,480
I just wanted to be near Gilles,
to see him, hear him.

735
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,520
I was less than 10 meters from him!

736
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:57,640
It was amazing!

737
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,080
Amazing!

738
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:03,640
And how many meters
were you from Elsa Floriot?

739
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,640
I didn't touch her, I swear.
She wasn't even at the party.

740
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:10,040
But didn't you attack Judith Garin
three years ago?

741
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,960
No. She attacked me.

742
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,240
She couldn't bear
what Gilles and I had.

743
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,840
What was that exactly?

744
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:19,200
Thank you.

745
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,480
Do you know Blanche St Léger?

746
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,520
The heroine in Gilles' novels?
That's me.

747
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,480
You'd better change the tea.
It's affecting you.

748
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:34,240
Blanche is a librarian like me.
My age, looks like me.

749
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,680
I am his muse.

750
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,560
Every time he writes,
I'm in his fingers.

751
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,080
I'm in his life for eternity.

752
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,920
Why would I lay into
some passing girl?

753
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,680
Yes, why?
So, you didn't enter the manor?

754
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,360
Er...

755
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,400
How come your fingerprints
are on the Luger display case?

756
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:57,560
I just wanted to see the katana
from The Samurai's Honor!

757
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,520
I'd never hurt Gilles or his family!

758
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:00,960
I love him! I love him!

759
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:05,080
Just get her out of here! Blimey!

760
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,800
She's nuts.

761
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,640
How could she have known
where the display case key was?

762
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,640
She spent her time spying on him.

763
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,920
Yes, okay, thank you.

764
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:37,000
My love to Eve and the kids.
Yes, thanks, thanks.

765
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,680
She's in custody.

766
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,400
My mate from the prosecution office
confirmed it.

767
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:44,120
They'll place her
under investigation for murder.

768
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:47,000
She should never have left
the psychiatric hospital.

769
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,000
At least it's over.

770
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,080
He's right. Let's turn the page.

771
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,120
Let's try to go forward, for Alex.

772
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,120
Is this a bad time?

773
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,920
How sweet, the family
gathered together like this!

774
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,200
We've been told about
Corinne Vidal's arrest.

775
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:04,800
She says she's innocent.

776
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:09,800
She had motive, opportunity,
and access to the weapon.

777
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,920
But did Col. Mustard
kill Ms. Scarlett in the study

778
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,360
with the candlestick?

779
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:15,720
We don't know.

780
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,440
Mr. Garin,
I want to show you something.

781
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,640
She's a nasty piece of work!

782
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:32,680
Come and see.

783
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,800
She should be in custody!

784
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,960
No, Tahar's watching her. Right,
Tahar? Come and see this.

785
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,800
Here are two plants:
plant A and plant B.

786
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,240
We found plant A

787
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,960
the day after the crime
in the bedroom. Okay?

788
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:53,960
It was in this state.
A bit wilted, basically.

789
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:57,920
The odd thing is,
Joséphine watered it the day before.

790
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,240
I don't know.
I don't have green fingers.

791
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,520
Me neither, but I have eyes, see?

792
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:05,960
So I put plant B here.

793
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,640
I put it here, in the same spot.

794
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,960
I left it
for the same period of time.

795
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,520
And it looks beautiful.

796
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:13,720
Strange, right?

797
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,640
Maybe, I don't know. Ask my gardener.

798
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,200
No need. Give me your hand.

799
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:20,080
Give it to me! I won't eat it!

800
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,800
Let's place
the little paw gently on this.

801
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,680
Is it hot or cold?

802
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,240
-It's cold.
-Yes.

803
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,520
But on the day after the crime,
it was warm.

804
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:32,160
That means it was on all night. So?

805
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:34,680
Does that ring a bell?

806
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:35,800
That's Ice Crime!

807
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,080
-Yup.
-That's in Ice Crime!

808
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,400
Remember?
The killer turns the heating up

809
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:43,000
to delay rigor mortis and confuse

810
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,400
the estimation of the time of death.

811
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:49,080
I get it now! Page 395.
Oh, Mr. Garin!

812
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,000
Get her out of here.

813
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:52,240
Okay, off you go.

814
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,800
No, no.

815
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:57,800
Yes, yes. Off you go.

816
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:00,880
Sorry,

817
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,400
how could I ever imagine

818
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,840
that the killer
would be inspired by my own novels?

819
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:11,080
He must have read all your books,
that's for sure.

820
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,160
Like Corinne.

821
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:15,080
But you have a computerized boiler.

822
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,400
And Tahar
read the data from your boiler.

823
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,800
We've re-estimated
the time of death:

824
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,800
it was
between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m., in fact.

825
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,520
-Before the party?
-Yes.

826
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,600
There was
a soundcheck for the quartet.

827
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,960
That may be
why nobody heard anything.

828
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,800
Maybe, yes.

829
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,520
What bothers me is that
Corinne was at the hotel then.

830
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,600
There are witnesses. Annoying, right?

831
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,240
So, I was thinking, maybe...

832
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:46,240
I don't know.
What were you doing at that time?

833
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:49,640
I'm a suspect?

834
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:54,520
Yes.

835
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,000
So what could my motive have been?

836
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,520
Elsa looked after my son.

837
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:02,240
Why would I kill her?

838
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,760
I don't know.

839
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:08,560
After all,
you are the great master of suspense,

840
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,440
the great seducer.

841
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:11,600
You are handsome.

842
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,080
And Elsa was cute too.

843
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:15,960
-Cute?
-Cute, yes.

844
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:19,960
A bit like your old girlfriend,
that young actress.

845
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:22,240
She was the same age as Elsa, right?

846
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,240
Yes, well, you know,

847
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:29,640
that's all in the past, Captain.
A long time ago.

848
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:33,080
Do you think
I'm stupid enough to kill

849
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,520
using my own novel as inspiration?

850
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,840
No.
I don't think you're stupid at all.

851
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,040
A bit wily, maybe. Yes!

852
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:44,680
Wily enough to put us off the scent.
I'm sure of that.

853
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,800
You deserve to be
in one of my books, you know.

854
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:51,680
Thank you.

855
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:54,280
But unfortunately for you,
I have an alibi.

856
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:55,280
Shit.

857
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:58,040
I was with Cédric,
working on his manuscript.

858
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,720
Cédric, the other writer.

859
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,680
Yes, well, he will be. Talented too.

860
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:05,480
In fact, I suspect
he even sought this job

861
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,280
so he could achieve his aim.

862
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,600
Not very nice.

863
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:10,960
Cédric...

864
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:13,840
If he's expecting help from you,
he'll have to wait,

865
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:16,840
because you're a bit short
on inspiration, aren't you?

866
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,080
How long since you last wrote a book?

867
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:20,440
Four years, isn't it?

868
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:25,880
If I didn't hold you
in such high esteem, Captain,

869
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:27,880
I could get upset.

870
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,840
Yeah, but people like me,
I don't know why.

871
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,360
It must be my... glamourous side.

872
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:36,720
It must be that.

873
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,920
What? I'm not that ugly, am I?

874
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:56,080
Well? They're not going to
release that woman, are they?

875
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,120
I fear they are.

876
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,800
When will it end?

877
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,760
I've had enough of this!

878
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:07,320
I'm scared.

879
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,000
I worked on my manuscript

880
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,840
until 7:45 p.m. with Gilles.

881
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,560
After, we all went
and got ready for the party.

882
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:22,480
You don't believe me?

883
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:25,400
Two suspects
using each other for an alibi

884
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,080
happens all too often.

885
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:29,880
I'm a suspect now, am I?

886
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,280
Yes! Exciting, right?

887
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,320
I had no reason to kill Elsa.

888
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,120
I didn't have problems with her.

889
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:38,680
Who did then?

890
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:40,520
That's not what I meant.

891
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:47,760
Marc... Durieux. He was chasing her.

892
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,240
Sometimes... rather insistently.

893
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,080
One day, I had to intervene.

894
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,320
You've only just remembered that now?

895
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:59,000
You should take a screening test
for early-onset Alzheimer's.

896
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:00,440
They do great ones now.

897
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:09,480
Well played.

898
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:19,440
Tell me: your tortured artist...

899
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:24,040
When he's not making frenzied,
Christian Vander-style sounds,

900
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,760
what's he like with the ladies?

901
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:26,840
My brother-in-law?

902
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,040
Of course.

903
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:32,560
In Paris, he racked up the notches.
He liked people to know.

904
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:34,760
What about here?

905
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,480
It's different here.

906
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:39,680
This is a village,
the prettiest women are all married.

907
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,520
It's harder and riskier.

908
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,520
There are young women.

909
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:44,960
They're still available.

910
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:46,640
You mean Elsa?

911
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:52,120
That's not a bad view? Even
from behind, it must inspire you.

912
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:53,960
Not as much as that.

913
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:57,680
Yes, I can see.
You should write a bit.

914
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,160
Maybe.

915
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,000
Do you really believe he could...?

916
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:05,160
I don't believe anything.
I'm not even baptized.

917
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:08,520
I let
my feculent imagination run wild

918
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:12,040
and then I do my wee reports
on my wee machine!

919
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:18,200
"Feculent imagination"...

920
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,960
At 6 p.m., I was at the town hall
with the council.

921
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:27,280
I was playing
the phone music on hold

922
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,520
that they ordered from me.

923
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:30,760
Oh yeah?

924
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,320
Your sound stuff?

925
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,960
Well, at least
it'll keep the callers at bay.

926
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,520
I don't make music to sell it.
It is research.

927
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,320
Researchers don't make much money.

928
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:44,960
Fortunately, you have Garin.

929
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,880
Is that why you're helping

930
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:50,560
your Sugar Daddy's mates?

931
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:54,440
Gilles is right when he says
you're not as stupid as you look.

932
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,320
He said that? I'm flattered.

933
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:57,960
Thank him for me.

934
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,520
Anyway, after you played them
your weird opera,

935
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:01,840
you came back here?

936
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:04,600
No, I went
and had a drink at Fanny's.

937
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:07,040
I got there at about 6:30 p.m.

938
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:10,960
Was it Cédric who told you
I was hanging around Elsa?

939
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:12,840
Why "Cédric"?

940
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,440
He must be scared.

941
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:17,040
That little shit
was hitting on her, not me.

942
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:19,760
I can understand.
She was a pretty girl and...

943
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,080
And what?

944
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:23,080
Elsa was no saint.

945
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:25,720
She dressed like a nun
because of Garin,

946
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:28,920
but there's no mistaking
the looks she gave.

947
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:33,160
Yeah?
And that didn't tickle your chops?

948
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:36,120
No! I prefer them
more vampish and tortured.

949
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:40,120
But Cédric is young.
And despite his good looks,

950
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:43,120
he's more of an academic,
not very experienced.

951
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,440
I reckon he's more into Grindr.

952
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,920
But Garin never noticed?

953
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:51,120
Even if he did,
Elsa took good care of Alex.

954
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,400
Is this the stuff you record?

955
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:59,520
I see there's one from 3 days ago,
recorded between 5 and 8 p.m.

956
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:02,120
Weren't you at the town hall
and café then?

957
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:04,920
I leave mics on
on the grounds sometimes.

958
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:10,560
Your pals must be happy
that you tap their conversations.

959
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,680
I'm keeping this.

960
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:49,480
Yes, he did come in at 6:30 p.m.

961
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:51,160
Going for Gold was on.

962
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:53,400
We never miss it.
The whole bar plays.

963
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:55,120
When did he go?

964
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,600
I don't know, just after the...

965
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:02,280
Ah yes! Just after
the local news at 7:50 p.m.

966
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:03,840
I remember they announced

967
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:06,000
the Compiègne
Philharmonic's concerts.

968
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:07,440
He screamed, "That's shit!"

969
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:09,760
On this list, there's a Julien Brun:

970
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:10,600
a relative?

971
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:11,720
He's my son.

972
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:13,840
Really? He's Garin's gardener too?

973
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:15,400
No, not exactly.

974
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,120
No, he's a council gardener.

975
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:21,280
But when Garin
needs his rose bushes pruned,

976
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:23,880
he's sent by the mayor,
if you know what I mean.

977
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:26,280
Okay. So your local taxes are used

978
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,160
to prune Garin's roses?

979
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:30,640
I call that abuse of social assets.
Disgusting!

980
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:34,320
What Garin wants, Garin gets.
At the manor and anywhere else.

981
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:35,320
You hate him, right?

982
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:41,440
He thinks he's the village lord.
His mother was much nicer.

983
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:42,680
You knew her?

984
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,480
She worked in the hotel
when my parents ran it.

985
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:48,000
She was a teen mum,
she lived here with her son.

986
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:51,080
Garin and I are five years apart
but we got on well.

987
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:54,280
Then his mother married the baron

988
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:56,080
and he became the little lord.

989
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:59,080
And that broke your heart,
really pissed you off.

990
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:01,600
You were in love with him,
weren't you?

991
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,400
You read too many romance novels.

992
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:07,720
I love them: your mind drifts off
into wonderful... How can I put it?

993
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:09,080
Anyway, who cares.

994
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:12,160
So, who was your son's father?

995
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:13,160
Not Garin.

996
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:18,120
Is that your Julien in the photo?

997
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:20,160
Cute, right?

998
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,880
Does he have a boyfriend, girlfriend?

999
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:25,760
No, I'd know about it.

1000
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,280
Don't bank on it!

1001
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:30,040
At his age, you never tell all.
Especially not to Mum.

1002
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:31,560
I'm off to the kitchen.

1003
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:32,800
Okay.

1004
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:46,400
The prosecutor just phoned me.

1005
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:47,840
You're off the hook,

1006
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:49,640
given that you helped us out.

1007
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:51,000
-Thank you!
-No problem.

1008
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:53,880
You're great. You're so great!

1009
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:56,720
Okay! That's enough!
Or I'll lock you up again!

1010
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,000
And watch out, okay?

1011
01:02:58,120 --> 01:02:59,600
Leave Garin in peace now.

1012
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:02,000
No. No,
I can't leave him unprotected.

1013
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:02,880
Why not?

1014
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:05,880
His wife is toxic.
She takes advantage of his kindness.

1015
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:07,160
She's the murderer.

1016
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:09,520
Yeah.
Only because you can't stand her?

1017
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:12,120
No,
because she's pathologically jealous.

1018
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:14,920
And she's his publisher:
she knows his work by heart.

1019
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:18,040
She killed Elsa
and made Gilles look guilty

1020
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:19,600
in order to separate us.

1021
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,560
But Blanche
won't be pushed around.

1022
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:23,280
Yes, well, amen to that.

1023
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:25,880
By the way,
did Elsa have a bloke or not?

1024
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:28,120
Could this be him?

1025
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:31,840
The gardener? No.
Well, I never saw him with her.

1026
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:34,520
Really? Well, thanks.

1027
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:37,560
Instead of spying on people,
you should write stories

1028
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,680
and sign up for that competition:

1029
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:40,760
that's your thing.

1030
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:42,200
That's not fair play.

1031
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,400
Blanche St Léger doesn't write,
she acts.

1032
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:45,720
Yes, true, I forgot.

1033
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,360
And I feel
she's going to return. I feel it.

1034
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:50,600
Yeah, yeah, good, good, bye.

1035
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:22,280
You're hurting yourself
standing here.

1036
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:27,440
Remember when we took them
for that boat ride?

1037
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:33,280
You told them that you were a pirate
before you wrote books.

1038
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:38,560
Then they both wanted
an eye patch and a wooden leg.

1039
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:50,320
Alex drew a picture
of us four earlier.

1040
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:54,720
He, his brother and you are so tall
that your heads touch the clouds.

1041
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:59,600
And I'm tiny, perching on a flower.

1042
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,200
It's not personal.

1043
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:13,280
Work on your topspin,
catch it on the bounce.

1044
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:15,720
He's really talented, you know.

1045
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:19,080
He's your brother,
that's enough for me.

1046
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:29,720
Catch it!
You can't even get that one!

1047
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,680
What does she want now?
Can't she leave us be?

1048
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:38,360
Don't worry.

1049
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,760
How are you lovebirds?
Out for a walk?

1050
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:43,120
How about a girlie chat?

1051
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,160
Don't worry,
I'm ugly, but I don't bite.

1052
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:49,080
It'll be fine, you'll see.

1053
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:55,360
He's good, right?
Like the Williams' dad.

1054
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:57,560
Is that a Nagra?

1055
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,720
You don't like tennis, do you?
Do you prefer football?

1056
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:27,480
Don't you talk?

1057
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,880
He's hard work, that kid.

1058
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,640
We do what we can.

1059
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:37,440
I'm not judging you.

1060
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:40,520
My job is observing, listening.

1061
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:42,560
Like Corinne Vidal, for instance.

1062
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:45,440
That woman? She talks nonsense.

1063
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:46,400
Really?

1064
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,840
She's psychotic.

1065
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:51,840
Yes, I was jealous years ago,
but it's over now.

1066
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:54,200
And Gilles' behaviour
is beyond reproach.

1067
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:55,400
Are you sure?

1068
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,880
It may seem naive to you, but yes.

1069
01:06:58,040 --> 01:06:59,720
I can feel it.

1070
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:01,560
He's changed a lot since...

1071
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:05,000
Since Alex's brother
had his accident?

1072
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:08,320
Life can be shit sometimes, right?

1073
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:13,440
Gilles lives for his family now.
That's what matters most to him.

1074
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:16,160
So I had no reason to kill Elsa.

1075
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:19,120
I want to believe you,
but you need an alibi,

1076
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:20,880
a really good one.

1077
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:25,360
I was with the caterers all afternoon
getting the party ready.

1078
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,120
Check with the firm, Belon.

1079
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,360
Started smoking again?

1080
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:48,280
Yes, after eight years.
Silly, I know.

1081
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:51,000
I'm the wrong person to lecture you.

1082
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:54,120
So she's got it into her head
that it was one of us.

1083
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:55,120
Yes.

1084
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:58,560
She's like a dog
that won't let go of its bone.

1085
01:07:58,720 --> 01:07:59,840
Hey, honey?

1086
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:03,360
Did you see Elsa
before the fireworks?

1087
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:06,800
Yes. Till he had
his maths lesson with Cédric.

1088
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:07,720
Ah, yes.

1089
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:10,800
Come on, Joséphine.

1090
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,160
He finished at 5:30 p.m.,
if my memory serves me right.

1091
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:20,840
But did you see Elsa
after your lesson?

1092
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:23,680
No, he was playing alone in his room.

1093
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:28,120
Your mum's annoying, right?

1094
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:30,640
"I'm big now, Mommy,
I can talk for myself!"

1095
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:32,800
Did you see her or not?

1096
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:39,120
Well, I heard her.

1097
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:44,120
I was in the garden and I heard her
shouting in Uncle Marc's studio.

1098
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:46,160
What was she saying?

1099
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:48,360
I dunno.
But she had her angry voice on.

1100
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,800
Who do you think
Elsa was arguing with?

1101
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:53,480
You don't know? A man, woman?

1102
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:57,720
You are starting
to really annoy me, Captain!

1103
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:59,680
Leave my son alone!
He's not even nine

1104
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:02,120
and he's already suffered!
So, paws off!

1105
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:04,040
You're impulsive, aren't you?

1106
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,120
Careful, you may hurt someone.

1107
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:10,280
I'll give you my shrink's number:
Olga's great.

1108
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:11,720
She only costs 50 euros.

1109
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:14,560
Tahar?

1110
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:17,320
Come on...

1111
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:23,640
That's it, the writer's seething.

1112
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:26,640
Like a slow-cooked leg of lamb.
You turn on the gas,

1113
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:29,320
there's a heat shock,
then you lower the heat

1114
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:31,720
and it simmers for seven hours.
Do you like lamb?

1115
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:33,440
-Yes, definitely.
-Yeah!

1116
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,240
I have the ballistics report.

1117
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:38,520
What does it say? Let's see.

1118
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:39,600
Here.

1119
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:41,280
So,

1120
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:47,000
da dee da dee da... 5.93!

1121
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:48,440
Fuck!

1122
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:58,800
Velocity... Analysis...
Da dee da... Point of impact...

1123
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:06,840
Well, well! Incredible, right?

1124
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:10,400
I am sorry, Captain.

1125
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,720
It was hard
for Alex to lose his brother.

1126
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:15,600
He had barely recovered.
And then this.

1127
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:17,880
I'm worried he'll go down again.

1128
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:18,960
I understand.

1129
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:22,760
You know,
under my ushanka, I have a heart too.

1130
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,560
Is that
why you don't send him to school?

1131
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:27,920
He's still too fragile.

1132
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:31,480
It would do him good
to see other folk, other kids too.

1133
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:33,160
Maybe, I don't know.

1134
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:38,040
I'm doing my best, going with my gut.
But, what with Elsa's death...

1135
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:39,280
Once again, sorry.

1136
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:41,040
No harm done. Shall we go?

1137
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:47,000
By the way,
do you like slow-cooked leg of lamb?

1138
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:49,600
Certainly.

1139
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:54,920
Slow-cooked leg of lamb?

1140
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:57,360
According to ballistics, the shot

1141
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:00,080
came from hip level.

1142
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,360
From the spot I'm on.

1143
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:05,840
The culprit enters the room,
Elsa wakes up.

1144
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:07,960
He's surprised
and shoots instinctively.

1145
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:12,440
And he gets naked
and dances the Carmagnole.

1146
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:15,680
Fuck! She must've put it somewhere!

1147
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:17,840
And what would that be?

1148
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,160
Her mobile phone!

1149
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:21,400
A 22-year-old girl must have a phone,

1150
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:24,600
even if her dad, her boss,
or the Holy Spirit doesn't agree!

1151
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:25,720
This is insane!

1152
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:29,560
We looked for her
but she's not with any provider.

1153
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:30,880
And prepaid cards?

1154
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:34,200
Prepaid phone cards exist.
I'm sure they have them here!

1155
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:36,320
Where the fuck did she put it?

1156
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:38,480
Not in here.

1157
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,720
You left this in the lounge.

1158
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:55,600
The bank phoned.

1159
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:58,880
Your manager was charming.
He even offered condolences for Elsa.

1160
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:02,040
He was upset when he realized
I didn't know about the money

1161
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:03,560
you paid her every month.

1162
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:06,720
Rather large sums for an au pair.

1163
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:08,680
I can explain.

1164
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:09,800
Don't bother.

1165
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:12,960
My brother was right.
You haven't changed.

1166
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:16,320
Except that you pay them now.

1167
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:20,040
You're pathetic.

1168
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:31,240
Mr. Garin, the mad lady
with the sheepskin rug on her head

1169
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:32,880
is searching Alex's room.

1170
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:42,320
Douai, this is Douai. The train
will stop for 2 minutes. Toot, toot!

1171
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:44,840
That's one tortured kid.

1172
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:50,160
Get out! You shouldn't be in here!

1173
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:53,560
Calm down, Sir.

1174
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:58,240
And lower your voice. Or we can do
your interview somewhere else:

1175
01:12:58,400 --> 01:12:59,280
at the station.

1176
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:01,520
Really?
I just spoke to the prosecutor.

1177
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:04,440
You're off the case
if you're not done by tomorrow night!

1178
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:06,320
Ooh! I'm scared...

1179
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:15,160
Look what I've just found?
Whose little phone is this?

1180
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:16,880
I don't know.

1181
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,520
Well, it is agreed,
I accept thy challenge.

1182
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:24,000
By tomorrow night, I shall have found
the murderer, my dear cousin.

1183
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:25,560
I love acting. Wasn't I good?

1184
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:26,760
Certainly.

1185
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:34,520
She was cute,right?

1186
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:39,840
Did she have a bloke?
Isn't that the gardener?

1187
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:44,080
Yes. Maybe their liaison
made the writer jealous?

1188
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:45,080
For sure.

1189
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:52,840
I love you, Judith.

1190
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:53,880
I love you, okay?

1191
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:56,880
Why do you feel threatened
every time I see a woman?

1192
01:13:57,080 --> 01:13:58,440
Because you love trophies.

1193
01:13:58,600 --> 01:13:59,320
Stop it!

1194
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:01,360
No. Even I'm one.
You show me off.

1195
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:03,160
You love me
more than the others

1196
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:05,160
but I'm still a fucking trophy!

1197
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:07,160
No, stop it, would you?

1198
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:13,760
I want to be your wife, Gilles,
your mistress,

1199
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:16,240
and I want to be
your son's mother again.

1200
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:19,760
You need to have verified
everyone's alibis by tomorrow night!

1201
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:23,440
The town hall people,
the guys employed by that clown,

1202
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:27,520
the caterer, and the temps too:
get me all that info

1203
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:28,880
before tomorrow night.

1204
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:31,680
Otherwise, I'm in deep shit.

1205
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:32,880
Wow! That's magic!

1206
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:35,960
Yeah.
You should look at this afterwards.

1207
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:36,880
What is it?

1208
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:38,080
Julien's record.

1209
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:40,520
Julien would never do that!
He's not violent.

1210
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:42,120
That's not what it says here:

1211
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:45,480
"assault on a public road,
assault and battery."

1212
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:49,040
It was a fight at a dance.
That happens, doesn't it?

1213
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:52,880
1 month in hospital! He gave the guy
a whooping. That's a long time!

1214
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:56,040
What's he like?
Is he a jealous type?

1215
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:59,000
It wasn't serious with Elsa:

1216
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:00,480
he would've mentioned her.

1217
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:03,600
Plus, Elsa wasn't hit, she was shot!

1218
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:10,040
Ladies and gents, we're closing.
Go on, out!

1219
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:12,600
Come on, faster than that!

1220
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:14,320
Or I'll lock you all up!

1221
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:16,480
What do you think this is?

1222
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:24,160
Right, if you want me to help
your son, I need information.

1223
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:26,320
Where was Julien?

1224
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:28,600
I swear I don't know where he is.

1225
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:31,320
I haven't seen him
since the afternoon of the party!

1226
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:35,600
That's why you think
maybe he killed her, right?

1227
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:38,240
Tahar?

1228
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:41,560
Yes, can I get
Julien Brun's GPS coordinates?

1229
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:43,480
His phone GPS, his geolocation...

1230
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:44,600
Incredible!

1231
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:47,320
In The Dead Island Mystery,
I catch the killer

1232
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:48,760
by geolocating his phone!

1233
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:50,280
What are you doing here?

1234
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:52,600
It's rude to eavesdrop!

1235
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:54,320
Only joking! I like rude folk.

1236
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:55,680
What's up?

1237
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:57,600
I've selected passages

1238
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:00,440
from my best investigations
to help you in yours.

1239
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:01,480
Stay there.

1240
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:05,400
Here.

1241
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:10,040
It's... You will look after them,
won't you?

1242
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:11,760
They're the apple of my eye.

1243
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:13,320
My whole life's in here.

1244
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:19,040
-I helped a cop in Death is No Fix.
-Oh yeah?

1245
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:21,480
We're a good team, aren't we?

1246
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:24,600
Great. Right, good night.

1247
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:41,040
Are you okay, my darling?

1248
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:47,280
A bit sad? Do you miss her?

1249
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:50,320
Everyone misses her.

1250
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:54,960
Time to sleep now. You need to sleep.

1251
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:03,320
Right, into bed now.

1252
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:17,400
Love you.

1253
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,840
Right, that's it. He's asleep.

1254
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:34,640
Poor little lamb.
He needed his mummy and daddy.

1255
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:35,640
Yes.

1256
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:39,640
Marleau is right when she says
we're keeping Alex in a tomb.

1257
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:42,200
There's not enough laughter
in this house.

1258
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:45,480
Talking of Marleau,
the Julien situation was unexpected.

1259
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:48,440
It won't hold for long.
He hasn't a killer's profile.

1260
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:49,400
I'm not so sure.

1261
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:53,160
He was seeing her,
he is nowhere to be found,

1262
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:54,840
and he can be violent.

1263
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:57,480
It could work very well.

1264
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:01,880
Fanny Brun is at the gate, Sir.
She says it's important.

1265
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:16,320
Help me, I beg you.

1266
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:18,600
It can't be him! Not my Julien!

1267
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:22,040
Calm down. I'll call
the prosecutor's office tomorrow.

1268
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:23,480
It's too late tonight.

1269
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:25,760
You will help me? Promise.

1270
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:28,920
I swear. Remember?

1271
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:31,200
"Cross my heart and hope to die..."

1272
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:32,760
"Stick a needle in my eye."

1273
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:36,200
That's it. Now, go home.

1274
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:38,840
Off you go.

1275
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:04,600
She's worried sick.

1276
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:07,760
It's okay. I'm already jealous
of the women you will meet,

1277
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:09,480
I won't worry about your exes.

1278
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:14,640
The money for Elsa
was for her to resume her studies

1279
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,280
when Alex
no longer needed her.

1280
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:21,000
To compensate her
for all her time lost here.

1281
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:22,480
But I should've told you.

1282
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:23,600
I believe you.

1283
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:27,800
I want us to get through this
and be happy again.

1284
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:38,600
Fuck, he's crazy.

1285
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:42,480
What rubbish! There are even
door sounds. What nonsense.

1286
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:44,640
Ah, maybe not.

1287
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:48,920
What is it now? Who is it?

1288
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:50,920
Well?

1289
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:51,760
What?

1290
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:54,720
The books! Did you quiver?

1291
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:57,640
Laugh? Cry? Tremble?

1292
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:59,800
That's Gilles Garin for you.
Unique.

1293
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Dedication, a universe, a mystery.

1294
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,040
You said it:
he's a mystery all right.

1295
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:06,360
Which do you like best?

1296
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,640
Look, I've got a crime to solve.

1297
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:10,600
Ah, funny, that's not my favorite.

1298
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:13,080
But there's a great twist
on page 263.

1299
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:15,760
Yeah, okay, okay.
We'll discuss it when I've read it.

1300
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:17,080
Right, goodbye.

1301
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:19,320
Here. This is the best.
I nearly forgot.

1302
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:22,040
-Okay?
-Ah yes, this one. Thanks, bye!

1303
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:23,920
-Good night!
-Yeah, okay.

1304
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:26,080
Me, read such shite?

1305
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:31,040
Aren't the Jacksons on this?

1306
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:34,640
Shut the fuck up!

1307
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:47,040
What are you doing? Come to bed.

1308
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:49,520
I won't sleep.

1309
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:56,440
I have a good way to relax you.

1310
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:03,040
It's a lost cause tonight.

1311
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:08,080
Really? You think so?
Wanna bet?

1312
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:40,760
Yeah. Really?

1313
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:44,920
Ah, that's good news!
Great, thanks! Bye!

1314
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:48,000
Good news, Fanny.

1315
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:51,480
At the time of the murder,
your son was getting drunk

1316
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:53,040
in a bar in Joigny.

1317
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:54,880
He ended up in the drunk tank.

1318
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:56,600
How's that for an alibi?

1319
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:59,720
I knew it.
Do you know where he is now?

1320
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:01,880
No. And it's pissing me off

1321
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,840
because I need to ask your alky son

1322
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:05,920
a couple of questions, right?

1323
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:14,760
-What storyline are you after?
-What?

1324
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:16,840
What storyline are you after?

1325
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:20,040
One where he pulls the strings

1326
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:21,440
to silence Blanche.

1327
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:22,560
You mean me?

1328
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:23,440
Yeah, right.

1329
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:26,640
Sort of like
all the suspects have motives,

1330
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:29,760
but they have rotten alibis.
See what I mean?

1331
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:33,160
To cloud the issue, like looking
for a grain of sand on a beach.

1332
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:35,000
Or a needle in a haystack?

1333
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:36,160
Exactly.

1334
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:38,160
Cold-blooded Murder.

1335
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:39,320
Really?

1336
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:43,760
Cold-blooded Murder.
You haven't read it?

1337
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:44,480
Not yet.

1338
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:47,600
The culprit does the same,
but I work it out on p. 276.

1339
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:49,040
Ta.

1340
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:52,920
Okay, we take it up a gear.

1341
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:56,160
That's it now!
I want Garin and Co.'s phone records,

1342
01:22:56,360 --> 01:22:58,800
bills, bank statements,
and a list of their hobbies!

1343
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:03,160
Classy!

1344
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:05,440
You're my desert prince.

1345
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:08,080
Careful of my little legs.

1346
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:17,200
There's nothing going on between us.

1347
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:19,440
Of course.

1348
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:24,800
Hey, Garin, this really isn't cool!

1349
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,800
If you only give me till tonight,
how can I read all your books?

1350
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:31,640
Nobody's forcing you
to do such an awful chore.

1351
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:33,600
The murderer is.

1352
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:36,160
He's been copying
those two books of yours.

1353
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:38,360
What're they called?
Cold-blooded Murder

1354
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:41,360
and.. not Ice Age...
I've seen that film.

1355
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:44,360
Anyway, something to do with ice.
It's not very sporting!

1356
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:47,520
So, you still think I'm guilty?
And I'm using my novels?

1357
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:50,000
Well, what else could it be?

1358
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:52,600
Ah...
Maybe you're protecting someone.

1359
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:55,880
That, too, is one of the ploys I use

1360
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:58,000
in several of my books.

1361
01:23:58,160 --> 01:23:59,320
Would you like a list?

1362
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:01,760
Watch it, Garin,
I have a good right cross.

1363
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:07,920
And I dodge well.

1364
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:10,160
Yeah...

1365
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:11,480
However,

1366
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:16,200
when Blanche St Léger
makes allegations in my novels,

1367
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:19,040
she has proof.

1368
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:20,760
Yeah...

1369
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:24,320
Be careful, Garin.
This is not a novel.

1370
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:54,480
Julien!

1371
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:04,240
Tell me about your crush on Elsa.

1372
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:07,080
I adore love stories!

1373
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:10,760
She told me to meet her at 4:30 p.m.

1374
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:14,920
No way! You can't do this to me!
I love you!

1375
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:17,760
He's pressuring me.
He'll kick me out if we carry on.

1376
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:20,240
Hand in your notice then!

1377
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:22,960
Who gives a shit about Garin's son?

1378
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:25,080
You're dumping me for your job?

1379
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:31,200
No way.
Are you shagging him?

1380
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:32,600
Are you shagging him?

1381
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:37,040
It's not my fault... I swear...
I love him.

1382
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:39,040
Are you mad?
You're young, beautiful.

1383
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,760
He'll leave you, he's married!

1384
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:42,040
Not for long.

1385
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:45,200
She said she'd tell Judith

1386
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:47,080
and she would leave Garin.

1387
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:48,520
What happened after that?

1388
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:50,760
I realized it was over,
went off in my car,

1389
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:55,080
found a bar, started drinking. Things
degenerated, owner called the cops.

1390
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:58,480
Okay. But why did you
go off the radar afterwards?

1391
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:00,520
When I heard about Elsa,
I got scared.

1392
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:03,200
I thought,
if someone had heard our row...

1393
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:05,360
I was the ideal culprit.

1394
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:07,960
He rang me earlier
to reassure me

1395
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:10,320
and I said he could come back.

1396
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:23,200
I like Juju and his silly stories,

1397
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:25,200
but that won't get us anywhere.

1398
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:27,960
Frankly,
there aren't enough suspects,

1399
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:30,880
or rather, there are too many,
and not enough culprits.

1400
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:32,760
Do you see what I mean?

1401
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:34,320
I think that Garin

1402
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:37,200
is working backwards. It is a trap.

1403
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:39,600
Wait,
Garin could've silenced the girl,

1404
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:41,520
thinking she would tell his wife.

1405
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:45,200
Or it could've been jealous Judith
because Elsa had told her all?

1406
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:48,320
Yeah. Or it was Judith's brother!

1407
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:49,920
If she leaves her husband,

1408
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:52,760
Durieux can kiss goodbye
to chateau life, his studio,

1409
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:55,400
and his "contemp...tible music"
concerts.

1410
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:56,800
There's Cédric too.

1411
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,120
He's in the running:
he loved Elsa.

1412
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:00,480
Yeah...

1413
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:11,480
What the hell are you doing?

1414
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:14,800
Take a look at this!

1415
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,560
-What?
-You should look.

1416
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:18,560
It'll interest you.

1417
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:23,560
The bitches!

1418
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:32,040
They really took the piss out of me!

1419
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:35,480
Look! Cédric and Durieux!

1420
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:37,320
Look!

1421
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:50,080
Right, relax and concentrate.
Go on, Alex. Nice, big movements!

1422
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:54,480
Push me! Push me!
Before the beetles get me!

1423
01:27:54,640 --> 01:27:56,120
I loved this when I was a kid.

1424
01:27:56,280 --> 01:27:57,360
Yeah?

1425
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:03,640
Did you call me here to push you,
or do you have something to say?

1426
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:06,960
The one doesn't exclude the other.
I wanted to check something.

1427
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:10,360
So, Cédric and Durieux
were both hitting on Elsa, right?

1428
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:13,240
I told you, I don't know.

1429
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:15,960
Okay, but is that possible or not?

1430
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:19,680
Marc is a womanizer,
Cédric is the same age as Elsa, so...

1431
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:22,200
Yes... It's credible...

1432
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:25,960
Credible? You blow me away, frankly!

1433
01:28:26,160 --> 01:28:29,920
Yup. Either you're very stupid,
which I don't believe for a minute,

1434
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:32,760
or you're really clever,
a total master.

1435
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:35,200
Passing two gay men off as straight

1436
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:36,800
so they become murder suspects?

1437
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:40,200
I take my ushanka off to you!

1438
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:42,640
You overestimate me.

1439
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:46,040
And you're humble too. Great!

1440
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:48,360
So, in light of this,

1441
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:50,840
who are our suspects now?

1442
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:53,080
You or your wife, or both of you?

1443
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:55,760
Did your wife know
you were sleeping with Elsa?

1444
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:57,640
I wasn't involved with Elsa.

1445
01:28:57,800 --> 01:28:59,560
That's not what Juju said.

1446
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:02,480
He even said
that she left him to go with you.

1447
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:07,360
Okay, not now,
not in front of my son. Please.

1448
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:08,920
My office, five minutes.

1449
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:13,200
Six! Watch out, the clock's ticking.

1450
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:24,520
Back a bit!

1451
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:28,640
Don't move.

1452
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:35,840
Is he improving?

1453
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:39,800
He's got a good touch.
And he enjoys it.

1454
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:42,440
Look after him, okay?

1455
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:45,480
-Nice weather too!
-Yeah.

1456
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:48,360
Right, watch the ball. Perfect!

1457
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:52,480
Good!
Move towards the ball, step back.

1458
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:56,920
I love oak.

1459
01:29:57,120 --> 01:30:00,760
It's beautiful, it smells good,
like coffins.

1460
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:04,640
It's frank, it's direct,
it's not like those stupid reeds.

1461
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:05,760
It doesn't bend.

1462
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:08,920
In short, oak doesn't lie.

1463
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:13,360
You win, Captain.

1464
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:20,920
We'll... We'll cut our losses.

1465
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:28,240
Elsa was going to
tell Judith everything.

1466
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:31,480
It was impossible to reason with her.

1467
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:34,200
So you killed her?

1468
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:39,960
That's strange:
with the imagination you have,

1469
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:44,160
how come you chose
such a stupid way to do it?

1470
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:45,480
You don't get it.

1471
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:49,720
Judith would have left with Alex.

1472
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:52,200
I couldn't have handled that.

1473
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:55,920
I have already lost one...

1474
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:58,640
one son.
I couldn't bear to lose a second.

1475
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:01,880
Okay. But why have you made
everything so confusing?

1476
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:06,960
Because I underestimated you.
I'm sorry.

1477
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:10,080
It's easier to kill with a pen,
right?

1478
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:13,560
That said, making it look
like everyone was guilty:

1479
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:15,720
brilliant!
You totally got me there!

1480
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:19,920
I take no credit.
Everyone depends on me here.

1481
01:31:20,120 --> 01:31:22,800
Even your wife?
Your wife seems to love you.

1482
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,680
No, she was the only one
who didn't know.

1483
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:28,720
How honorable you are:

1484
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:31,600
classy, to the very end.

1485
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:37,680
I might start a new series in prison.

1486
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:39,480
With a character like you in it.

1487
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:41,880
Someone sexy then. That's kind!

1488
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:45,240
Could we...

1489
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:48,080
Could we avoid using handcuffs?

1490
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:53,160
In front of my son?

1491
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:55,000
Sure.
You're not coming with us.

1492
01:31:55,160 --> 01:31:56,360
Go and join your kid.

1493
01:31:57,080 --> 01:31:58,280
You're not arresting me?

1494
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:01,080
No. You've cried wolf so often,
I don't believe you.

1495
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:02,240
But I confessed.

1496
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:04,880
No, you didn't confess,
you strung me along!

1497
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:08,000
But the final act
has only just begun, my dear.

1498
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:10,600
I've always dreamt of saying that.
How stupid.

1499
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:14,400
Don't sulk,
you're still under judicial scrutiny!

1500
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:16,560
In case you decide to go to Panama

1501
01:32:16,720 --> 01:32:19,120
with your little family.

1502
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:24,200
Will you drive?

1503
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:25,480
Certainly.

1504
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:43,360
What kind of car is this?

1505
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:44,520
You sure about this?

1506
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:46,520
Yes, this car prefers you to me!

1507
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:47,680
I don't mean the car.

1508
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:49,880
Garin? Yeah, yeah. It's not Garin.

1509
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:52,560
He's protecting someone.
Nice try, but it's not him.

1510
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:55,760
He had a motive.
What about Julien's testimony?

1511
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:59,800
Know what I do with testimony?
I chuck it out in Babazoule Street!

1512
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:00,880
Know the song?

1513
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:03,920
Last night... in Babazoule Street...

1514
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:05,120
-You know it?
-Yes.

1515
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:08,280
We found...
A strangled girl on the ground!

1516
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:09,280
Three, four!

1517
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:12,880
The police... full of mischief...

1518
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:13,960
Put up posters...

1519
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:15,080
Yeah, that's it!

1520
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:17,560
Which told us that...
Three, four!

1521
01:33:19,160 --> 01:33:22,400
I'm thirsty! I've heard so many lies,
I can no longer swallow!

1522
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:24,320
Can I have a beer, please?

1523
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:26,480
Here, this came in for you.

1524
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:27,840
What is it?

1525
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:34,000
Phone tracking details.
Julien's phone's GPS.

1526
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:35,120
A bit late now.

1527
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:36,840
Thanks.

1528
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:39,400
Ah, maybe not!

1529
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:43,560
Look. Back in a minute.

1530
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:47,480
Can I have Julien's room key, please?

1531
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:48,640
Excuse me?

1532
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:50,200
Julien's room key?

1533
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:57,760
Thank you.

1534
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:09,440
Just like rolling a joint:
you never forget.

1535
01:34:11,640 --> 01:34:12,480
Yes!

1536
01:34:15,480 --> 01:34:16,640
Now then...

1537
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:20,600
Nothing underneath, honey?

1538
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:25,440
What's this? What is this?

1539
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:29,440
Bingo!

1540
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:35,200
I've searched Julien's room. Nothing.

1541
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:38,400
Yeah? Well, I got lucky! Look.

1542
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:42,680
Yeah? How much?

1543
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:45,320
20,000 euros, I'd say.
Not bad for an innocent guy?

1544
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:47,920
Yup. Are you ever wrong?

1545
01:34:48,120 --> 01:34:51,520
No, I'm always right, especially
when it comes to guys. Girls too.

1546
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:56,240
Juju!

1547
01:34:57,800 --> 01:35:00,640
I've got
your phone's GPS coordinates here.

1548
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:03,360
Funny: it says
you went to Garin's place

1549
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:05,360
just before going to your mom's.

1550
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:07,560
Were you missing your roses?

1551
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:09,800
Look. Did the roses phone you?

1552
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:11,640
Must've been hard for them:

1553
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:13,560
leaving the ground,
finding a phone,

1554
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:16,040
keying in your number
with their thorns,

1555
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:18,720
then having a 43-second conversation!

1556
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:22,080
To me, it looks more like
a summons from Garin, right?

1557
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:23,920
Why would Garin want to see me?

1558
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:25,360
I don't know...

1559
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:27,480
To tell you about your scene
in Act II?

1560
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:30,360
You know, the love scene
where you break up

1561
01:35:30,520 --> 01:35:32,000
and your chin trembles.

1562
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:34,520
You nearly had me sobbing:
you were good.

1563
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:37,040
It was true.
I loved her, I wanted us to go away.

1564
01:35:37,240 --> 01:35:39,520
Yeah, half-true. Cut the crap.

1565
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:41,760
Yes, Elsa did dump you. But why?

1566
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:43,800
She was scared of losing her job.

1567
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,480
And that must've hurt your pride.
Yes or no?

1568
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:48,320
Why would I have lied to you?

1569
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:50,480
"Why would I have lied to you"?

1570
01:35:50,680 --> 01:35:53,200
You should do auditions, you know.
You're good!

1571
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:56,760
But I don't know many temps
who earn a fee of 20,000 euros.

1572
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,960
You searched my car!
You can't do that!

1573
01:35:59,080 --> 01:35:59,960
What do you mean?

1574
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:02,160
In emergencies, I search what I like!
Okay?

1575
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:04,160
I won the money at poker.

1576
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:05,600
Yeah, sure you did.

1577
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:08,160
Don't worry.
I'll tell Garin you're not a snitch.

1578
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:09,880
Hey! Give me my money back!

1579
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:11,440
This is evidence.

1580
01:36:11,640 --> 01:36:14,160
And I play poker too:
I've got a game with Jojo.

1581
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:15,120
Bye.

1582
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:22,560
What are you doing?
No, you can't arrest Garin!

1583
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:25,240
It wasn't him!
It can't be him! No! No!

1584
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:28,000
Shove off! Shove off!
She's totally nuts!

1585
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:58,920
Garin? Judith, where is your husband?
Quick!

1586
01:36:59,160 --> 01:37:01,280
I don't know, in his office?
What's wrong?

1587
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:03,320
Stay there. Don't move.

1588
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:07,360
Fuck...

1589
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:10,680
What's this?

1590
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:15,240
"I cheated on my wife...

1591
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:17,360
I killed Elsa...

1592
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:19,240
I hope my son forgives me."

1593
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:21,240
Fuck, I suspected this. Idiot!

1594
01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:22,000
Why?

1595
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:25,520
If he kills himself,
he can't recant his confessions!

1596
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:26,960
Where is he?

1597
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:30,600
What does this mean?

1598
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:33,400
It means
he's trying to save your son.

1599
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:35,520
Your son killed Elsa, didn't he?

1600
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:38,160
Wake up! Stop play-acting!

1601
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:40,680
Gilles has gone to kill himself.
Where?

1602
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:42,840
I don't know! I swear!

1603
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:45,000
Leo? Where did Leo drown?

1604
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:46,320
In the lake.

1605
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:48,320
Fuck! Check round the house.

1606
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:12,680
No!

1607
01:38:13,640 --> 01:38:17,120
No! Gilles! No, don't do it!

1608
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,400
Please! You have no right!

1609
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:22,680
Garin! Garin!

1610
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:25,960
Think of Blanche!

1611
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,880
If you kill yourself, she'll die...
And me too!

1612
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:31,760
I'm warning you!

1613
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:34,400
If you do it, I'll jump in the water!

1614
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:35,760
And Blanche can't swim!

1615
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:38,240
Silly idiot! You'll screw it all up!

1616
01:38:38,440 --> 01:38:41,680
Clear off! You're heavy too!

1617
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:45,400
-Bugger off up your ladder!
-Captain, we must do something!

1618
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:46,560
Clear off!

1619
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:47,920
Help him!

1620
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:51,520
Garin! Garin, wait till I get there.

1621
01:38:51,680 --> 01:38:52,920
Don't move!

1622
01:38:53,120 --> 01:38:55,600
Fuck, look at me!
This isn't Captain Marleau,

1623
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:59,440
it's Captain Nemo! I'm coming, Garin!

1624
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:27,120
You never let go, do you?

1625
01:39:27,320 --> 01:39:31,120
No. They call me
the Carpathian pubic louse.

1626
01:39:33,160 --> 01:39:36,440
So, tell me. What's the story?

1627
01:39:36,640 --> 01:39:39,160
When he went into Elsa's room
with the Luger,

1628
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:41,600
he didn't mean to kill her?
Accident, right?

1629
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:00,320
What are you doing in my room, Alex?

1630
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:03,480
What are you doing with that?

1631
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:06,560
Why are you playing with that?

1632
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:08,480
The priest told me

1633
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:12,200
when I died, I would see Leo.
Do you think that's true?

1634
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:14,120
It's not loaded?

1635
01:40:26,640 --> 01:40:28,600
What have you done, my darling?

1636
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:30,680
What have you done?

1637
01:40:31,960 --> 01:40:34,600
Come, come.

1638
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:40,480
Since Leo died,
Alex has been a shadow of himself.

1639
01:40:40,640 --> 01:40:42,640
It was an accident.

1640
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:44,960
Alex is only nine years old.

1641
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:46,800
He won't be charged.

1642
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:50,960
I'm a public figure.
His name will be all over the papers,

1643
01:40:51,160 --> 01:40:54,200
in all the media, on the radio, TV,

1644
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:57,320
social media, everywhere.

1645
01:40:58,080 --> 01:41:00,880
For his whole life,
he'll be the kid that killed.

1646
01:41:01,560 --> 01:41:02,920
He'll never get over it...

1647
01:41:03,080 --> 01:41:04,280
Of course he will!

1648
01:41:04,440 --> 01:41:06,480
I should've checked the Luger
for bullets.

1649
01:41:06,680 --> 01:41:08,560
It's my fault, all my fault.

1650
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:11,960
As was Leo's death.

1651
01:41:14,720 --> 01:41:17,080
Daddy! Daddy!

1652
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:18,640
No, double for the rights!

1653
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:20,480
He's not going to get stingy?

1654
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:24,600
No, absolutely not!
No, I will not give in.

1655
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:26,040
-Daddy!
-No, be quiet!

1656
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:27,960
I'm on the pho--

1657
01:41:30,280 --> 01:41:31,200
Leo!

1658
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:38,480
No, Garin, don't be stupid. Wait.

1659
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,440
If you shoot yourself,
who'll look after your kid?

1660
01:41:59,960 --> 01:42:01,240
Judith.

1661
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:03,960
I couldn't have coped without her.

1662
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:07,000
When Leo died,
she single-handedly cared for us.

1663
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:11,120
Do you think she could handle that
a second time? No.

1664
01:42:11,680 --> 01:42:14,040
Alex will need his father.

1665
01:42:14,240 --> 01:42:16,600
He'll need you
when the truth comes out.

1666
01:42:16,760 --> 01:42:18,880
It'll still come out
if you shoot yourself.

1667
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:20,720
And how will he cope?

1668
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:22,840
Can you imagine
how guilty he'll feel?

1669
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:26,000
"Where's your dad?"
"He killed himself because of me."

1670
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:28,480
How can you live with that?

1671
01:42:32,600 --> 01:42:33,880
I'm tired.

1672
01:42:37,880 --> 01:42:39,560
Go on, shoot. What can I say?

1673
01:42:40,240 --> 01:42:42,680
Go on, let him cope by himself!

1674
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:47,240
What will his mother say to him? Huh?

1675
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:48,400
When you're dead?

1676
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:50,440
How will she stop him
from killing himself?

1677
01:42:50,600 --> 01:42:52,000
He'll want to copy you,

1678
01:42:52,120 --> 01:42:53,200
he'll kill himself.

1679
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:55,320
Do you want him to drown himself?

1680
01:42:55,480 --> 01:42:56,760
Blow his own head off?

1681
01:42:56,960 --> 01:42:58,440
End up in a loony bin?

1682
01:42:58,560 --> 01:42:59,680
Become a drug addict?

1683
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:02,280
Because that will happen.
One way or another.

1684
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:05,440
You know it will.
You're a better psychologist than me.

1685
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:07,760
Don't be an idiot, Garin,

1686
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:09,720
give me that. It's over now.

1687
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:31,040
Hello!

1688
01:43:32,360 --> 01:43:34,720
I've come to say goodbye.
I saw the prosecutor.

1689
01:43:35,480 --> 01:43:37,680
Elsa's death
will be treated as an accident.

1690
01:43:37,880 --> 01:43:40,000
And since you have authorization

1691
01:43:40,160 --> 01:43:42,040
for the guns, you won't be charged.

1692
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:46,200
Right, I'll leave you two alone.

1693
01:43:47,560 --> 01:43:48,480
Thank you.

1694
01:43:51,880 --> 01:43:54,640
No charges? Even
for obstructing the investigation?

1695
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:56,600
Don't push it, mind you!

1696
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:59,760
But you won't go to prison,
I don't think.

1697
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:01,400
You'll have a good lawyer.

1698
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:03,960
You'll make them cry
in the courtroom.

1699
01:44:07,240 --> 01:44:10,920
I have something for you.
To thank you.

1700
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:14,400
Signed first editions.

1701
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:18,280
Ice Crime and Cold-blooded Murder.

1702
01:44:18,440 --> 01:44:20,000
You always get
the last word in!

1703
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:22,000
Yes. You don't have to read them.

1704
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:26,600
Really? I might read them then!
Inchallah!

1705
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:29,520
Thanks to you, I'll get Alex
out of his ivory tower.

1706
01:44:29,720 --> 01:44:32,840
I'd call it a "prison".
Anyway, you're the poet.

1707
01:44:34,640 --> 01:44:37,080
I've decided
to put him in the village school.

1708
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:40,520
Ah, social diversity?
It'll do him no harm.

1709
01:44:43,880 --> 01:44:46,280
I may not look it, but I am strong.

1710
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:50,400
You can count on me, Alex.

1711
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:52,760
I'll always be here to protect you.

1712
01:44:54,160 --> 01:44:55,280
Mommy...

1713
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:04,840
You know... I have
loads of ideas for a new novel.

1714
01:45:06,160 --> 01:45:08,120
By the way, what's your first name?

1715
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:11,080
My first name? Captain.

1716
01:45:13,080 --> 01:45:14,520
Well then,

1717
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:21,040
thank you... "Captain".

1718
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:25,440
Idiot!

1719
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:33,240
Bye, lovebirds!

1720
01:46:03,800 --> 01:46:05,000
Come in!

1721
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:09,080
Your car is washed, repaired,
and waiting down below.

1722
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:11,280
Not a moment too soon, right?

1723
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:12,880
Well, it's an old car.

1724
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,240
It's not easy to find the parts.

1725
01:46:15,400 --> 01:46:17,160
The old ones are always the best.

1726
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:25,720
I have something to show you!

1727
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:26,480
What?

1728
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:28,160
It's Gilles' next manuscript.

1729
01:46:28,320 --> 01:46:30,160
You haven't been back to the manor?

1730
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:31,560
You're really nuts, right?

1731
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:33,800
Just for five minutes.
I left right away.

1732
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:35,960
Look, he's created a new character.

1733
01:46:36,120 --> 01:46:37,960
A woman. Captain Lomart.

1734
01:46:38,120 --> 01:46:38,840
Lomart?

1735
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:40,640
Lomart. Does it ring a bell?

1736
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:41,640
Any first name?

1737
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:42,920
Victor.

1738
01:46:43,120 --> 01:46:44,360
-Victor?
-Victor.

1739
01:46:44,520 --> 01:46:45,520
Not bad.

1740
01:46:48,160 --> 01:46:51,280
United we stand! Right, bye!

1741
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:53,160
What? My bag stinks?

1742
01:46:53,320 --> 01:46:54,440
Yes, a right stench!

1743
01:46:54,600 --> 01:46:57,000
Your nose is too close to your mouth.

1744
01:46:57,160 --> 01:46:57,960
Fanny!

1745
01:46:58,120 --> 01:46:58,920
Yes?

1746
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:01,400
I wanted to say goodbye. Kiss?

1747
01:47:01,560 --> 01:47:02,800
Yes.

1748
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:03,840
There we go.

1749
01:47:04,480 --> 01:47:06,040
You're always welcome here.

1750
01:47:06,240 --> 01:47:08,360
I'll be back
for the next murder, promise.

1751
01:47:10,440 --> 01:47:12,560
-Goodbye!
-Bye.

1752
01:47:20,040 --> 01:47:21,080
You washed it?

1753
01:47:21,240 --> 01:47:22,840
Yes! It was dirty!

1754
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:27,200
It looks awful.
Come on, shake a leg!

1755
01:47:33,280 --> 01:47:34,200
There you go.

1756
01:47:34,360 --> 01:47:35,160
See ya, sweetie!

1757
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:37,480
-Safe journey.
-Kisses!

1758
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:55,040
