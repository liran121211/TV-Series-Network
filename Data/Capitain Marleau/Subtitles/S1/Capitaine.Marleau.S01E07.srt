1
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,710
Take me to seventh heaven.

2
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:25,830
OK.

3
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,710
You have to control your fall
and trajectory.

4
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,270
And see where everyone is.
You're not alone.

5
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:41,590
If while you're falling,
you go under your partner like this,

6
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,150
he'll fall on you.

7
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,790
It would be dumb to die so young.

8
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,110
-Carlos, you're holding us up!
-I'm coming!

9
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,710
-Have what you need?
-Yes. You'll look great.

10
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:20,550
CAPTAIN MARLEAU

11
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:29,590
125, 126, 127, 128,

12
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,870
129, 130, 131, 132...

13
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,430
Bidding on the clouds?

14
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:41,510
138, 139, 140.

15
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,430
Yes! I knew it!

16
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,990
What? Have we declared war?

17
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:47,950
Do you see that?

18
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,430
That silhouette, that arch...
Beautiful.

19
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,230
Yeah, that's a plane.

20
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,710
It's much more than that.
Are you kidding?

21
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,310
It's an angel from heaven.

22
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:02,110
I bet it would take 140 seconds
to circle the valley.

23
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,590
I always win my bets.

24
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,710
Lucky you.

25
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,790
I hate lucky people.
They're a personal affront.

26
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,430
It's not luck.

27
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,870
It's intelligence.

28
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:15,270
Exactly. That's even worse,
as Britney would say.

29
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,430
-OK. Goodbye, madam.
-Goodbye, madam.

30
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:58,950
UP IN THE AIR

31
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,310
I'll go first.

32
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,470
OK. Grab on.

33
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,430
Take me to seventh heaven.

34
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,990
There's only one.
Where's the other one?

35
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,310
There's one on the ground.
Alexandrine.

36
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,550
Dammit!

37
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,270
Yes, the Captain's here now.

38
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,110
Gentlemen.

39
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,350
Thank you.

40
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:30,630
Well?

41
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:35,350
It looks like she died from fractures
and internal bleeding

42
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:38,030
due to the speed of the fall,
which, at 4,000 meters

43
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,470
going against buoyant support,

44
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,710
was no faster than 195km/h.

45
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,750
Stop. I'm scared of heights.
I'm going to throw up.

46
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:56,070
Alexandrine Raguenès, member
of the Grandes Ailes parachute club.

47
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,830
23 years old, single.

48
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,270
Poor little thing.

49
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,590
Get the Captain, please.

50
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:14,630
Captain, the parachute specialist
wants to talk to you.

51
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,590
A parachutist?
I hope he's not here to torture us.

52
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,750
What do you say?

53
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,350
I'll say tampering, Captain.

54
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:23,030
Neither the main
nor emergency parachute opened,

55
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,030
and there's no hand deploy.

56
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:28,070
The grips were stuck
and the release mechanism failed.

57
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,350
Jeannette, go get a translator.

58
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,470
Of what?

59
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,310
An earth-to-sky translator. Go on.

60
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,190
She's actually going!

61
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,470
Jeannette, why are you leaving?
Come back.

62
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,150
Bijart will translate for us.

63
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,710
A hand deploy
is a small extraction parachute.

64
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:49,710
The parachutist takes it out
and releases it. It flies off,

65
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,430
pulling the strap
to pull on the chute and open it.

66
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:55,070
And bam! It didn't open.

67
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,030
-How awful!
-Yes, how awful!

68
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,630
It was a professional job.

69
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,870
The strap was cut.

70
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:04,190
They must have cut
the emergency parachute too,

71
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,510
which didn't open.

72
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,590
Tampering equals premeditation,
which equals murder.

73
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,430
Call the prosecutor, Jeannette.

74
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:29,470
Our team won't win the championship
this year.

75
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,790
What do you want?

76
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,470
To go and pretend?

77
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:36,350
Observe a minute of silence
like nothing happened?

78
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,470
We have 3 months...

79
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:40,590
We're not going. And stop drinking.
You're killing yourself.

80
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,350
Tell your husband to let it go.

81
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,910
This is not the time. Not today.

82
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:52,630
I'm sorry, old man. I love you.
That's why I'm a pain.

83
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,230
OK, OK.

84
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,870
And you're right.
All we can do is drink.

85
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,910
Elvira, another round for everyone.

86
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,790
Thanks.

87
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,470
To young Alexandrine.

88
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,790
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

89
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:20,750
The national police would like
to offer its sincere condolences.

90
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:24,150
Oh! You don't waste any time.
Drinking straight up!

91
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,750
Be careful.

92
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,470
My colleagues are waiting outside
with breathalyzers.

93
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,790
They're so tricky.

94
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:34,070
So what are you betting on?

95
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,950
Accident or sabotage?

96
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,910
I never play around with death.

97
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,510
Me neither.
And besides, I'd be cheating,

98
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:45,310
because I just learned Alexandrine's
parachute was tampered with.

99
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,230
Folks,

100
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:53,790
Captain Marleau
and the corrections staff

101
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:57,790
will now circulate
to take your statements

102
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,630
and fingerprints
and scrape the inside of your cheeks

103
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:05,630
using a small cotton swab
found under your seats.

104
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,350
Thank you for choosing
Marleau Airlines.

105
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:11,030
Gentlemen, they're all yours.

106
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,590
You'll see. It's fun.
It tickles.

107
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:21,950
Odds are 100 to 1 one of you
is the murderer. Want to bet?

108
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,310
Are you obsessed?

109
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:27,750
You'd be surprised to know
I never bet on death or crime.

110
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,590
Too bad. It would save me time.

111
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:33,190
You've got it all wrong, Captain.
Everyone here loved Alexandrine.

112
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:40,590
Exactly. Love is a gypsy child.
It follows no laws.

113
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:45,350
And that makes for a good crime.
And if you like crime...

114
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:48,950
Watch out for me!
Hey, hey, hey!

115
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,510
Where to, Churchill?

116
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,310
My name is Clémence Dos Santos.

117
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:58,110
Nice to meet you.
Did you know the victim?

118
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,910
My husband Carlos is an instructor.
He jumped with her.

119
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,670
Is that why you were looking
up into the air?

120
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,070
-You saw me?
-Yes.

121
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,790
I didn't recognize you.

122
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,390
It was just this morning!

123
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,390
I'm sorry. I'm terrible with faces.

124
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,070
So you wouldn't recognize
the victim's face either?

125
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:20,510
No. Carlos was upset
after the accident,

126
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,190
but I didn't know her.
I never met her.

127
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:26,030
Well, get a good look at my face,

128
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,470
because I think
you'll be seeing it again soon.

129
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,950
She's strange, that one.

130
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:40,750
Run a background check on her:
Clémence Dos Santos.

131
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,830
She doesn't remember seeing me
this morning. How irritating.

132
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:47,510
Really? That's strange.

133
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,670
Is this Alexandrine in this photo?

134
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:04,550
She did a summer course
two years ago. She caught the bug.

135
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:08,870
She gave 100%.
I was training her for her license

136
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:12,030
so she could join
our formation skydiving team.

137
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:15,670
What's formation skydiving?
Not like defamation skydiving?

138
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,110
No. It's a sort of team sport.

139
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,230
But the slightest mistake
will cost you.

140
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,310
Does infidelity count?

141
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,790
That has nothing to do with it!
She was my student.

142
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,270
What exactly happened up there?

143
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,950
Nothing unusual.

144
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,950
It was our first jump of the day.

145
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:46,830
We did several tricks. It's on film.
You can watch the video.

146
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:52,390
Then we each went
in our own direction,

147
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:54,390
so we wouldn't hit each other.

148
00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:00,670
I opened my parachute and...

149
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,950
I didn't see Alexandrine's.

150
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,470
She was gone.

151
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,270
Good morning!

152
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:49,550
Hush! Hush, Barbare.

153
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,590
Lie down, Barbare.

154
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:55,790
-Hello.
-Hello. Elvira Chastagne.

155
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:59,270
I'm in charge of traffic control
on the base.

156
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,230
And this is Barbare.

157
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,550
Marleau, national police.

158
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:04,710
Nice to meet you.

159
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,430
Someone's calling you.

160
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:09,110
Elvira, what do I do with the client?

161
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:11,830
Today won't work.

162
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,510
They closed the runway,

163
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:16,710
and I don't know
when they'll open it again.

164
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:19,710
Tomorrow or... a little later.

165
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,150
Thanks. Talk to you later.

166
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,750
You're making a real mess here.

167
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,710
It's awful.

168
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,190
Oh, it's awful!

169
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,270
Who could do that?

170
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,390
That's exactly what I wanted
to ask you.

171
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:34,430
Maybe the cat's among the pigeons.

172
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,710
A cat that knows about parachutes!

173
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:40,430
I pitched my tent at the end
of the runway. Is that a problem?

174
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,830
No, not at all.

175
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,830
If you need me,
I live in that little house,

176
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,310
with the flowerpots.

177
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,430
I'm there 24 hours a day.

178
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:51,110
The Labor Law is awful.
OK, well, thank you.

179
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,390
See you later.

180
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:55,750
Bye, Babar. Your dog doesn't look
like an elephant.

181
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,550
Thanks. You're a dear.

182
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,950
Ah! Do you recognize me now?

183
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,670
Yes. I'm not crazy.

184
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,430
You didn't yesterday.

185
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:24,310
I don't know what you mean,
but I remember you.

186
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,150
And you're not with your husband?

187
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,190
Who?

188
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,990
Your husband, Carlos Dos Santos.

189
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,430
He's my ex-husband.

190
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:32,710
Oh, I didn't think so.

191
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:35,590
I'd never go back to a jerk
who sleeps around.

192
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,950
I'm not a masochist.

193
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,470
So you think it's possible
he slept with Alexandrine?

194
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:41,990
I don't know who she is

195
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,710
but I'll bet 10 to 1 he did.

196
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,310
And I always win my bets.
Goodbye, Captain.

197
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:50,750
I bet... Sorry.

198
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,750
Jeannette!

199
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,030
See how he folds?
Do you do that at home?

200
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,350
-Uh... no!
-Me neither!

201
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:38,630
Sir?

202
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:41,510
When they finish folding them,
where do they go?

203
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:42,670
In there.

204
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:43,510
Who has a key?

205
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,550
We all have a key.
All the team members.

206
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,990
And who checks the parachutes?

207
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,270
Who checked Alexandrine's,
for example?

208
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,470
She did when folding it.

209
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:54,870
Before jumping, Carlos,

210
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:58,750
her instructor. They checked
each other's and jumped together.

211
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,750
Carlos. What a coincidence.

212
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,870
Carlos is a good guy.
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

213
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,190
He encouraged her.

214
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:09,430
He swore she'd jump
in the championship this year.

215
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,790
And then...

216
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,350
She didn't fall by herself.

217
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:19,190
The silence here is crazy!

218
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:22,070
You'd think you were in a cathedral.

219
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,190
Tell me, Mister...
What's your name?

220
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,950
Thibault Le Preux.

221
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,470
You were first on the scene.

222
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,190
Yes. She died in my arms.

223
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:35,430
I was a soldier for 20 years
but never saw a battlefield.

224
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,990
It's the first time I stared death
in the eyes.

225
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:39,870
What did she say?

226
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,710
She called for Carlos.

227
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:04,430
Oh, wow! It's an architect's house!

228
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,470
It's the Boulay forest.

229
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:23,910
I can see it's not a housing project!

230
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:27,630
Gentlemen.

231
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,470
-Hello.
-Hello!

232
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:41,430
This is beautiful!

233
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:45,190
As beautiful inside as outside!
Look at this view!

234
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:48,470
Thanks. It's my job.
I'm a landscape architect.

235
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:53,190
Oh, you designed those trees?
It's crazy. They look real.

236
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:57,230
Amazing!
Parachute jumps must pay well.

237
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:59,270
No. I pay for them.

238
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,950
Can't I earn more than my husband?

239
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:05,910
If I was a landscape architect,
I'd make more than my husband too.

240
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:09,030
But I don't have one.
Like you. You're divorced.

241
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,590
-From whom?
-Mr. Carlos.

242
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,470
Who told you that?

243
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,870
You did, earlier.
It doesn't matter.

244
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,310
Where is he?

245
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,910
He's not home yet.
He's in total shock.

246
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,190
Imagine a student dying in your arms.

247
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:24,150
But you bet me 10 to 1
she was his mistress.

248
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:29,630
That wasn't me, Captain.
It was my twin sister, Clara.

249
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,390
Your sister?

250
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:36,150
OK. So when you smoke smelly cigars

251
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,150
and make bets, it's your sister?

252
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:38,990
That's her.

253
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:42,710
And she was married to your husband?

254
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,110
She is his ex-wife, yes.

255
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,550
OK.

256
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:51,190
So you're your own sister-in-law,
in a way?

257
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,430
I'm lost.

258
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,710
Would you like some tea?

259
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:59,590
Was your husband a fighter pilot?

260
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,830
For 20 years.
With Thibault Le Preux,

261
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:03,590
who you must have met.

262
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:06,590
He was his mechanic.
They're inseparable.

263
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:10,310
Like Tanguy and Laverdure.
I loved watching them on TV.

264
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:14,470
So do you love diving,
flying and parachuting?

265
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,430
Is it your drug?

266
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,030
I fund the club but I hate planes.

267
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,630
You make no money from it?

268
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:22,270
My parents had plans

269
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,710
they always put off.

270
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:27,870
They wanted to go to Borneo and see
the sun rise over the North Cape.

271
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,350
They died in a plane crash
when I was 15.

272
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:33,910
Oh, my God!

273
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:36,750
I hated heights ever since
and live life to the fullest.

274
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,070
I understand.

275
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:41,430
So was it Carlos who told you
about the girl's death?

276
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,750
Yes, right away.

277
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,910
He said he'd never fly again.

278
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,430
I went to the club.

279
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,510
I said he couldn't give up,

280
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:49,990
that I loved him alive!

281
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,990
"Let's love each other alive,
not wait for death to abide."

282
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,630
That's St. François Valéry.
Write it.

283
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:57,750
Go on. Write it.

284
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,270
So what did your husband say?

285
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,710
Nothing. That was it.
Speak...

286
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:05,470
of the devil.

287
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:06,590
And he appears.

288
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,310
Carlos, could we speak alone
for a minute?

289
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,390
I have a question.

290
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:13,270
I have nothing to hide,
especially not from my wife.

291
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:14,350
Really?

292
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,750
Are you sure?

293
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:20,150
Because right before
Alexandrine died,

294
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:23,870
she said a name: Carlos.

295
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,030
Then she died, like in Batman.

296
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,310
Who said that?

297
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:32,470
God. We were chatting online earlier
but got cut off.

298
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:33,990
Your signal is weak here.

299
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:51,750
I still have this headache.
Never get old, Ismaël.

300
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,310
Why'd you say we were quitting?

301
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,030
I didn't say that,

302
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,030
just that I won't be there next week.

303
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:59,750
Are you kidding?
I'm screwed.

304
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:00,990
You're doing the job.

305
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,990
Look around. Cops are everywhere.
It's dangerous.

306
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:07,030
It has to calm down.
We must be invisible.

307
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,750
I'm not playing around.

308
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,790
I need my money. Now!

309
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:14,470
OK, OK. I'll work something out.

310
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:17,750
I'm your friend, Ismaël.
Don't forget that.

311
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:38,910
Let's go, sir.

312
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,910
I'm sorry, Mr. Raguenes,

313
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,870
but I need to know
who your daughter was.

314
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,030
I didn't know her that well.

315
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:50,030
I didn't even know
she was a parachutist.

316
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:54,030
I'm a farmer.
I never have time.

317
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:55,950
And her mother?

318
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,750
I was widowed 15 years ago.

319
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:03,310
I raised my daughter
as best as I could.

320
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:08,310
What kind of girl was Alexandrine?

321
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,190
She didn't need anyone.

322
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:14,310
When she was 11,
she wanted to go to boarding school.

323
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,310
She loved to work!

324
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:19,630
When was the last time
you talked to her?

325
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,030
At Christmas.

326
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:33,870
The neighbors told us
the seals were broken.

327
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:37,310
I let the technician in,
but maybe I shouldn't have.

328
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:41,190
I should've closed the scene
until you came back from the morgue.

329
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:43,630
But since you didn't answer
your phone, I...

330
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,470
Stop!

331
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:47,350
Can you stop with the guilt?
You're like an old Jesuit!

332
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,190
Yes, Captain.

333
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,470
Stop that too. I'm sick of it.

334
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:54,750
Did you find any samples, anything?

335
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:57,630
The technician took samples.

336
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:00,950
Clumps of hair
stuck in the shower drain.

337
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:03,750
Apparently hair can talk.

338
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,990
What language?
Say Portuguese

339
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,630
and I'll hit you.
Talking hair!

340
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,470
Can you imagine the morning breath?

341
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:13,190
Did you find any fingerprints?

342
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:17,030
No. Whoever came in here
wiped off all the fingerprints.

343
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:21,390
Did the cleaning fairy
steal anything?

344
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:25,310
I couldn't say.
But we have the computer,

345
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:28,670
because the guys who came to seal it
took it to the lab.

346
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:30,630
Now that's good news!

347
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:32,350
Always start with good news.

348
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,910
Otherwise how will we live?

349
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,350
Yes, Captain!

350
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:38,110
You nut.

351
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:46,310
What are you doing in the dark?
Come to bed.

352
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,630
Be honest.
Did you and she...?

353
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:55,470
Alexandrine?

354
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,190
She liked me a lot.

355
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:02,310
I was like her father or something.

356
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:05,190
Why didn't I ever meet her?

357
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,830
She would've bored you.

358
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:12,470
You're lying, Carlos.
I find it very pedestrian.

359
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:17,470
Clémence! There was never anything
between me and Alexandrine.

360
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:18,910
I swear!

361
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,630
I was about to close.

362
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:36,550
See? Even Barbare doesn't like me.

363
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,910
Give me something to drink.

364
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,550
The usual?

365
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,470
The usual, yes.

366
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:46,350
-There you go.
-Thanks.

367
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,070
I'll pour myself one.

368
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:50,190
Sing me my song.

369
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:52,550
Your song? Oh!

370
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:58,030
I want someone to choose me,
to love me,

371
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:01,350
before I get old,
to have a brave boy,

372
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:04,750
a friend, do this one thing:

373
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:06,190
just want me.

374
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:09,750
Cheers.

375
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,630
Hi, Mom.

376
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:29,550
I had a great day today.

377
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,350
I'm happy.

378
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,910
Even though I still miss you.

379
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,470
After all these years.

380
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,190
Of course I love him.

381
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:43,470
He's strong. He's funny.

382
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,750
Who is he?

383
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:45,710
He's gentle.

384
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:46,870
Tell Auntie Marleau.

385
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,190
But he's not free.

386
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:52,070
But I love him the way he is.
His name is Carlos.

387
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:55,910
Carlos!
Wait. What's the time code...

388
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:59,630
05:50:12.

389
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,190
I'll die if he leaves

390
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:03,550
You don't know how right you are,
sweetie.

391
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,430
Don't move!

392
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:16,910
Oh! What's his name?
Take it easy, Scooby Doo.

393
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,190
His name is Carlos.

394
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,070
I'll die if he leaves me.

395
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,550
OK. We'd been sleeping together
for a year.

396
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:30,190
You lied to me.
That's not good.

397
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,790
And yesterday you cleaned
her apartment.

398
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:36,070
I know you did.
Don't deny it.

399
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,910
The lab confirmed it.

400
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:40,630
It was our secret,
and I'd like it to stay that way.

401
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:44,070
A secret she wanted
to tell your wife.

402
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,790
Just before she died.

403
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:50,350
And when you have a rich wife
like yours,

404
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:51,510
that's a motive.

405
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,510
I didn't kill her.

406
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:57,070
OK. Then who did? A friend?
I don't know... Your wife?

407
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,190
No. Not her.

408
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,350
Not over that.

409
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,790
We have an open relationship.
You shocked?

410
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,070
Not at all.

411
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:11,350
I'm so unshocked
that I'll go tell your wife.

412
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:12,350
No, you can't.

413
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,510
I don't mind!

414
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:14,870
You can't hurt her.

415
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:17,070
Or what?
Are you going to be like Pinochet,

416
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,630
take me up in your plane
and throw me overboard?

417
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:20,910
That's one idea.

418
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,630
Fascist.

419
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:32,950
ohh, It's hot.

420
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,910
I heard you set up camp
at the end of the runway.

421
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,790
That's not very wise.

422
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:41,910
It's safe. An Alpine Shepherd
was watching me all night.

423
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:48,350
Is it true you spoke to Alexandrine
just before she died?

424
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:50,590
Yes.

425
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,870
You think I'm an idiot?

426
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,790
I know I look like one, but come on.

427
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:56,070
I spoke to the coroner.

428
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:59,510
He says she died
before she hit the ground.

429
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:01,030
So you couldn't have.

430
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:14,030
I swear I heard her call for Carlos!
I'm not crazy.

431
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,590
No. Well, yes.

432
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:19,070
He told me after she fell.

433
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:21,830
He was crying.
It's strange, because usually

434
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:24,830
we tell each other everything,
but he never told me.

435
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:28,390
Do you know De Seyne and Vladimir?

436
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:31,230
De Seyne was a pilot
and Vladimir was his mechanic.

437
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:33,510
De Seyne refused to jump
from a burning plane

438
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:36,630
because Vladimir was onboard
but had no parachute.

439
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:40,470
They tried to land twice
before they crashed.

440
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:43,510
They were buried together.
You see, madam,

441
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:45,750
Carlos and I are the same way.

442
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:50,070
Lovely. You're like the Montaigne
and Boétie of flying.

443
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:52,630
May I?

444
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:53,630
Go ahead.

445
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,630
Thank you. That's kind of you.

446
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:59,470
Then it's strange he didn't tell you

447
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:02,230
he'd been seeing Alexandrine
for a year.

448
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:07,510
Maybe he didn't want to hurt me.

449
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:11,510
Before marrying Clémence 2 years ago,
Carlos was married to Clara.

450
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,230
Then one day,
he left her, divorced her,

451
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,150
and married the other one.

452
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:18,630
I like Clémence, but I have to say

453
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:21,350
that Clara was different.
She's like us.

454
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,350
She loves planes.

455
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:26,550
Of course, the two sisters
got in a fight,

456
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:29,550
and I had to choose a side.

457
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:32,710
Choose a side, my friend.

458
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:35,350
You chose Carlos's side,
like Alexandrine.

459
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:39,070
Maybe that wasn't such a good idea.
Bye!

460
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,350
Hello.

461
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,990
Come in, quick.
I'm making a fire.

462
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:17,790
My boiler

463
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:20,790
broke and of course,
the heating guy never showed up.

464
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,910
The house is drafty.
Make yourself useful.

465
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:28,470
If you're interested,
I'm on an investigation

466
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:31,270
into Alexandrine Raguenes,
or her murder, anyway.

467
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:34,790
Of course I am.
Especially if my sister's involved.

468
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:35,790
Really?

469
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,190
That should feel better now.

470
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:39,350
Oh, it's hot!

471
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:43,070
Oh, do you kayak?
That's a giant oar.

472
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:44,150
It's a propeller.

473
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,070
Really?

474
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,630
This is my office, where I work.

475
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,790
I usually draw the curtains.
I like the dark.

476
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,670
It helps me concentrate. I write.

477
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,510
What are you writing? A novel?

478
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:54,710
I'm a historian,

479
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:58,230
studying the cathartic function
of torture in Ancient Rome.

480
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,070
The cross, the fire, the wheel.

481
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,910
Crosses of fire were gory.

482
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:07,630
And throwing a young girl
off a cliff was torture too.

483
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:10,230
Yes. They threw people
off the Tarpeian Rock,

484
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:12,110
but that was during the Republic.

485
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,350
I'm an Empire expert.

486
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:14,350
A Lady Napoleon?

487
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:15,910
Not exactly.

488
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:20,350
What was Lady Napoleon doing
on Thursday night?

489
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:24,430
I was here in this chair,
working until dawn.

490
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,510
OK.

491
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:28,350
Would you like some tea, Captain?
No, I'm joking.

492
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:31,790
What would you like?
Vodka, cognac, bourbon?

493
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,950
Doesn't matter. I drink local.

494
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:36,870
Hops, grapes, whatever you like.

495
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:39,150
You have a beautiful home.

496
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,870
Too bad we can't smoke.

497
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:43,390
Oh, no. That's right.
You smoke cigars.

498
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:47,150
So, can anyone testify
you were here that night?

499
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:48,350
I live alone.

500
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,790
You're a woman of good taste.

501
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:52,470
I didn't have a choice.

502
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,670
When your husband leaves you
for your twin,

503
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:56,390
you feel a bit bitter about men.

504
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,070
I understand.

505
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:03,510
So when you found out your ex-husband

506
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:05,910
was cheating on your sister,

507
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:09,150
did you go, "Yeah!" or, "Ohh..."?

508
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:11,790
Why do you care?

509
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:15,230
I care because, just for example,

510
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:17,510
if in a fit of anger,

511
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:20,870
you took revenge on Alexandrine.

512
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:24,390
Then my investigation would be over.

513
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:25,670
Nap, recess, gym.

514
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:28,150
But if I were the murderer,
I wouldn't kill her

515
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,070
but that jerk Carlos.

516
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:31,790
I didn't do anything.

517
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:32,950
Neither did I.

518
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,510
Is he that much of a jerk?

519
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:40,390
One day, he asked for a divorce.

520
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:43,750
That same day, I found out
he'd had a mistress for months:

521
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:45,590
my sister.

522
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:49,110
-How's that?
-It doesn't earn him much empathy.

523
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:53,070
I tried everything. I wanted
to get revenge, to make him pay.

524
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:55,110
I won a huge alimony settlement.

525
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:57,190
Guess what? My sister paid it.

526
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:59,390
I last saw them in court.

527
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:01,390
She said, "Now we don't owe you."

528
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:03,350
For what?

529
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:09,950
You know, I find hate and anger
exhausting.

530
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:12,790
I prefer a mustard bath.

531
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:15,390
But you don't seem exhausted.

532
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:17,790
With your little arms,
you can defend yourself

533
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:19,790
against anyone who gets in your way.

534
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:21,590
You have no idea.

535
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:26,310
In Caligula's day,
the torture for guys like him

536
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:27,950
was damnatio ad bestias.

537
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,110
What?

538
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:32,110
Torn apart alive
by ferocious animals.

539
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:34,390
How awful! Poor animals.

540
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:36,230
-Hello.
-Hello.

541
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:39,590
-Hello.
-Hello.

542
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:43,670
Well?

543
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:47,310
This is good,
but what if we move the pergola

544
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,510
toward the pond?

545
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,390
What do you think?

546
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,590
I'll be right back.

547
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:02,230
Clara?

548
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:05,510
The police just came over
to ask me about Carlos.

549
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,110
He killed his mistress.

550
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:08,830
What are you saying?

551
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:11,390
Nothing. I just wanted you to know

552
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:13,830
that he'll suck you dry
and then abandon you.

553
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:15,830
And you'll die alone.

554
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:40,310
Where is Carlos?
He's not answering his phone.

555
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:41,510
I don't know.

556
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:46,470
Did you know? How long
have you been covering for him?

557
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:49,110
I'm sorry.
He's my friend.

558
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,110
I know you don't like me much.

559
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:53,950
Why do you say that?
That's not true.

560
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,230
Don't bother.
I don't like you either.

561
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,030
This one?

562
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:07,550
No, maybe that one, on the left.

563
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:10,670
Oh, yes. Hang on.
I've almost got it.

564
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:12,950
No, no.

565
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,470
This one?

566
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,950
What the hell is going on here?

567
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:20,390
You scared me, Captain!

568
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:23,030
I hope so.
What are you two doing in here?

569
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:25,670
You authorized Mr. Dos Santos

570
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:27,470
to get Alexandrine's parachute.

571
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,550
Me? I didn't authorize anything.

572
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:32,550
Especially not a key witness
to walk around the evidence room.

573
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:33,550
Are you crazy?

574
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:34,990
I thought it was OK.

575
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:38,390
And Mr. Dos Santos
swore you said it was OK.

576
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:40,910
Go find a whistle.
You're back on traffic duty.

577
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,510
I don't want to see you. Go!

578
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,110
Come on...

579
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:49,950
I know she's not too bright,
but what's your excuse?

580
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:55,750
I need to see what the murderer did.

581
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,550
The tampering would be his signature.

582
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:00,550
The parachute isn't here.

583
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:03,390
It's on the judge's desk.
You want to play CSI?

584
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:06,830
Go play with him.
What time is it? 15:27.

585
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:08,710
I'm placing you in custody.

586
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,270
What's wrong with you?

587
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,830
You're a real piece of work.

588
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:19,110
You enter the victim's apartment,

589
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,230
you try to steal evidence

590
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:23,630
from under my nose,
which is rather big,

591
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:27,110
and you marry twin sisters
and cheat on them both.

592
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:29,550
In short, you lie to everyone.

593
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:32,230
It's a bit much.

594
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:36,630
You saw Clara.
She's completely insane.

595
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,830
Well, I understand.
I have a friend.

596
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:42,670
On his wedding day, his wife cheated
on him with his best friend.

597
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:43,670
He went insane.

598
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:47,270
So I imagine being cheated on
by your own twin sister

599
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:48,710
must really be something.

600
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,670
I picked the wrong sister.

601
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:53,630
Then I spent years with the one
who stinks of death.

602
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:57,390
But one day I decided it had to stop,

603
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:58,990
because life is too short.

604
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:03,670
So I grab it, eat it, devour it.

605
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:06,550
You're not Prince Charming.
You're the ogre.

606
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,710
But then who is the big bad wolf?

607
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:10,710
It's not me.

608
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,830
I would never do anything
that could risk

609
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:16,110
putting me in a 7m2 hole

610
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:18,270
and keep me from flying.
Never.

611
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:19,150
Then who did?

612
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,990
Clara.

613
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:27,830
I admit I considered it,
but I need a motive.

614
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:36,270
-Hate.
-Yes. That's not bad.

615
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:40,630
And an hour ago, she threatened
to throw you to the bestias.

616
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:44,270
I don't know what they are,
but they don't sound vegetarian.

617
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:48,430
We have to replace these five steps
with a disabled ramp.

618
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:49,350
OK.

619
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:50,990
Yoohoo!

620
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:52,150
Who's that?

621
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:58,870
Hello! Police.

622
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:01,430
What's the problem?
Can't you see we're working?

623
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:03,830
You think we're here to play Colombo?

624
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:07,990
Hang on. I left my cigarettes
on the desk. May I?

625
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:10,830
Cigarettes? Aren't you ashamed
to smoke at your age?

626
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:12,270
Let me see.

627
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:16,390
Fumar mata.
OK, go kill yourself outside.

628
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:17,550
Vià.

629
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,390
-Hello, madam.
-Captain.

630
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:22,790
I have a little search warrant
signed by the judge,

631
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:26,070
and I wanted to inform you
that your husband is in custody.

632
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,270
That's it.

633
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:31,590
I'm freaking out.
There are at least 20 of them.

634
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:35,430
Yes, really aggressive.
It's about the parachutist, clearly.

635
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:38,510
It's some serious action.
Hang on. I'll send a photo.

636
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,550
No photos allowed.

637
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:57,310
Captain.

638
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:59,550
Don't touch that.
It's personal.

639
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:01,550
Madam, don't get upset.

640
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:04,310
If it's not relevant,
we'll put it back. That's it.

641
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:05,710
They're letters from my mom.

642
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,510
How are they relevant?

643
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,270
What exactly are you looking for?

644
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:12,270
Anything: scissors,

645
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:14,990
pruning shears, tweezers...

646
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:17,070
Anything that can cut.
I'm not much fun.

647
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:19,150
Oh, look! Come see this, Captain.

648
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:24,830
That's a Beretta 9mm.

649
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:27,550
Do much sport shooting?

650
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:29,590
It's Carlos's service weapon.

651
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:33,110
I suppose you have the permit for it?

652
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:36,550
I suppose I could find it
somewhere in this mess.

653
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,230
Is there ammunition too?

654
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:39,590
No. There never was.

655
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:41,510
He never shot it.

656
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:43,030
Here's a valid permit.

657
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:44,590
Geez. You're upset.

658
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:47,710
When your head's in your shoulders,
it means you're upset.

659
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:49,510
You look like your sister.

660
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:50,870
Same green eyes.

661
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:52,590
Did Clara send you here?

662
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:55,550
When did you find out
about Alexandrine and Mr. Carlos?

663
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:56,310
Recently.

664
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:59,270
When you found out,
how angry were you?

665
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:01,590
Angry enough to kill her.
I'm joking.

666
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:04,030
There's a time and place.

667
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:06,710
National police, OK?

668
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:09,030
-Will you return my Beretta?
-I have to.

669
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:11,230
She wasn't killed by a gun
but a parachute.

670
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:14,390
And your permit is good.
I'm disappointed.

671
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:15,310
And Carlos?

672
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:16,830
No, I'm hanging on to him.

673
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:19,230
You can't have it both ways, madam.

674
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,590
OK, guys. Let's go.
Say bye to the lady.

675
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:26,150
-Goodbye, Madam.
-Goodbye, Madam.

676
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:32,990
You're very lucky
I don't like punishing people.

677
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:34,310
Thank you, Captain.

678
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:36,310
Let's play a game.
You take my phone.

679
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:39,470
I bet you
that in less than one minute,

680
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:42,150
the prosecutor will call me.
I bet you a beer.

681
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:47,270
Know why? Because we're not all equal
in the eyes of the law!

682
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:48,470
Some say we are,

683
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,550
but some are more equal than others.

684
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:51,590
Watch closely.

685
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:53,150
Well?

686
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:55,670
I win a beer!

687
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:58,150
-Pass it to me.
-I'll pick up.

688
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:03,550
Hello? Prosecutor, my God!

689
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:06,310
What a pleasant surprise.

690
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:10,750
How... Yes, of course.

691
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:12,430
We'll leave her alone.

692
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:15,150
The chief of staff? No!

693
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:16,950
OK. Very well then.

694
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:19,710
No problem. Thank you.
Goodbye, Prosecutor.

695
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:20,590
Goodbye.

696
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:23,310
You can hang up.
See? I told you.

697
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:28,310
So what do we do, Captain?
Stop questioning Clémence Dos Santos?

698
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:30,710
Why would we do a thing like that?

699
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:33,590
You just told the prosecutor
we'd leave her alone.

700
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:35,270
Listen, grasshopper.

701
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,710
Sometimes people think
they want one thing

702
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:40,030
but they really want the opposite.
Got it?

703
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:13,750
Can I have a drink?

704
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:18,590
Not your boring old tea either.

705
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:33,190
I heard your husband is in custody,
so I came over.

706
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:42,310
I spent many dinners
alone waiting too.

707
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:46,310
He always came home
with his pretty face full of lies.

708
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:50,030
Did you kill that girl?

709
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:52,350
Did you?

710
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:55,870
I wouldn't do it that way.
I don't know parachutes.

711
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:56,910
But you...

712
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:02,550
I'm not afraid of jumping,
or killing, I don't think.

713
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:06,350
But I had no reason to kill her.
On the contrary.

714
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:18,630
I'm glad he made you suffer too.

715
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:22,070
And I hope it really hurts.

716
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:26,630
Even though what I went through
is different from what you will.

717
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:30,750
Because competing
with a simple mistress

718
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:33,070
and your twin sister
is not the same thing.

719
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:36,350
I apologized 1,000 times, Clara.
I loved him then and I do now.

720
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:37,310
So did I.

721
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:43,590
I wouldn't kill her.

722
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:46,910
But I could kill him,
if I get the chance.

723
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:48,990
Don't take him from me.

724
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:51,350
What are the odds I will?

725
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:56,030
3 to 1? 15 to 1?

726
00:44:56,990 --> 00:44:58,910
I don't play those games.
They're not funny.

727
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:00,190
Well, I do.

728
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:13,190
You had to pay a big price for him,

729
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:15,470
but now he's destroying you.

730
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:18,790
It wouldn't be hard
to get rid of him.

731
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:21,190
I could do it.

732
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:24,310
Get out.

733
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:02,790
Mr. Dos Santos, you're free to go.

734
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:04,910
This way, please.

735
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:12,710
You look thrilled.

736
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:50,150
What's all this?

737
00:46:57,910 --> 00:47:00,190
I want you to go.
I want you out of my life.

738
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:24,350
I'm beat, my back hurts...

739
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:27,030
I don't care.
I don't want to hear it. Get out.

740
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:34,670
Was it Clara?
She came here, didn't she?

741
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:39,630
I knew it.

742
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:43,510
Don't let her do this to us.
Your sister is crazy.

743
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:48,230
I love you, Clémence.
You're all I have.

744
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:50,790
I didn't kill that girl,
or sleep with her.

745
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:53,910
She was in love.
She said all kinds of things,

746
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:55,870
made things up.

747
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:03,190
When I was 14,
I had a boyfriend, Julien.

748
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:06,790
One day I went out with someone else,
and I told him.

749
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:09,870
He got sick and left school.
I never saw him again.

750
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:14,390
My dad yelled at me and told me
admitting it

751
00:48:14,990 --> 00:48:16,590
hurts someone for no reason.

752
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:21,510
I'm not 14 anymore, Carlos,
and I want to know the truth.

753
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:23,110
Don't protect me.

754
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:27,110
Come here.

755
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:30,670
Come here, I said.

756
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:15,750
You weren't followed?

757
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:16,950
You still interested?

758
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:19,310
Yes. You think I enjoy not flying,

759
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:21,110
This has made a mess of things.

760
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:22,950
You're lucky I'm nice.

761
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:39,350
He's gone. Gone!

762
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:08,110
I'm sure you had dozens
of mistresses, Dad.

763
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:09,870
How do I know?

764
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:13,990
Intuition. But you never left Mom.

765
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:15,310
You busy?

766
00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:17,830
I knew you'd be here today.

767
00:51:18,270 --> 00:51:19,430
Leave us alone, Clara.

768
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:21,670
Stay away from your sister.
You're hurting her.

769
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:42,110
Leave us alone!

770
00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:45,990
You're one to talk.

771
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:49,830
Who cheated on her? Took her money?
Lied to her all day long?

772
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:51,230
Me?

773
00:51:52,270 --> 00:51:53,510
Don't touch me!

774
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:56,830
Hey! Calm down, Addams Family.

775
00:51:57,510 --> 00:51:59,990
This isn't Dracula, but it bites.
Careful.

776
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:03,270
You don't have to exaggerate,
Ms. Innocent.

777
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:05,910
You'll pay in court.

778
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:11,230
Sorry, but I have to re-arrest you,
Mr. Carlos.

779
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:15,150
OK, but I want to show you
something first.

780
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:16,230
What?

781
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:19,590
Alexandrine's body
was released to her family.

782
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:23,990
The funeral is on Tuesday.
I'm going.

783
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:25,830
I'll go with you.

784
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:27,830
What about you?

785
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:29,430
I'll go too.

786
00:52:29,590 --> 00:52:30,550
Good.

787
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:34,430
I'm going too.

788
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:36,470
What's Carlos doing?

789
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:38,150
Carlos is doing what he can.

790
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:41,270
Look. He's taking off.

791
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:57,430
It's small. It's tiny.

792
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:15,990
Aaaah! Did we take off?

793
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:26,590
We're going to fall!

794
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:31,590
We're going to crash!
I knew it!

795
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:32,990
Stop it!

796
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:36,470
I'm scared! I fell
off a stepladder when I was little.

797
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:37,870
I'm scared of heights!

798
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:42,750
You know, you should never let go
of childhood phobias

799
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:45,990
of things like spiders and heights.

800
00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:50,830
That's what you say!

801
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:53,310
It's letting go of your childhood.

802
00:53:54,790 --> 00:53:57,710
This is what I wanted to show you.

803
00:53:58,630 --> 00:53:59,910
I shared it with Alexandrine.

804
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:02,870
And that's stronger than anything.

805
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:05,150
Really?

806
00:54:06,190 --> 00:54:09,550
Well, I know a guy named Bacarus.

807
00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:12,430
He got too close to the sun
and melted.

808
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:15,710
Flying is one of mankind's
greatest dreams.

809
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:04,630
What's that path?
Where does it go?

810
00:55:13,470 --> 00:55:15,270
Nice and easy.

811
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:36,430
I actually liked it.

812
00:55:40,190 --> 00:55:42,070
You didn't put on your blinker.

813
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:44,750
My colleagues are on the runway.
They'll arrest you.

814
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:01,910
This way out.

815
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:08,430
Your place is too small
for legs like mine.

816
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:10,030
Next time we'll jump.

817
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:12,310
The guy who gets me to jump
from a plane

818
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:13,630
hasn't been born yet.

819
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:17,350
Oh, shoot.
Maybe you can help me after all.

820
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:21,310
I got the forensics report
on Alexandrine's parachute.

821
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:26,030
In short, it says the saboteur,
or the murderer,

822
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:29,350
cut the straps on both parachutes,
the main one and emergency one.

823
00:56:29,510 --> 00:56:30,310
What do you think?

824
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:33,270
You can't stop that.

825
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:35,310
You can't? Wouldn't you have noticed?

826
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:38,150
When you were folding it
or before you jumped?

827
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:42,470
When we check a parachute,
we look for mistakes,

828
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:43,790
not malicious intent.

829
00:56:43,950 --> 00:56:46,630
Well, happy trails.

830
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:53,590
The investigation isn't over,
but it's stalled!

831
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:55,310
It's a complicated job.

832
00:56:56,270 --> 00:56:57,910
I love crime thrillers.

833
00:56:58,070 --> 00:56:59,430
You're lucky.

834
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:04,910
Can I take you to dinner?
You can tell me all about it.

835
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:08,470
No, that won't be possible,
my friend,

836
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:10,790
because you're a suspect,
to put it simply,

837
00:57:10,990 --> 00:57:12,910
and we're investigators,
so no dice.

838
00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:15,750
Apples and oranges don't mix.

839
00:57:16,550 --> 00:57:17,630
OK.

840
00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:22,030
When you're done,
I'll take you to dinner.

841
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:23,150
I promise.

842
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:27,950
You're in love, Sergeant.

843
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:31,470
Not at all, Captain.
We were just talking.

844
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:34,230
She's in love!

845
00:57:34,430 --> 00:57:36,750
Be careful. We're like prostitutes.
You can't

846
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:37,870
fall in love.

847
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:40,310
Of course! I'm not an idiot.

848
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:42,630
Rebelling?
Good! It's about time.

849
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:44,750
Come on.
Let's go play drug dogs.

850
00:57:53,350 --> 00:57:54,470
Hang on, Jeannette.

851
00:58:14,430 --> 00:58:17,190
Oh, this is rustic.
I like it.

852
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:29,030
Look, Captain.
There are tracks.

853
00:58:29,150 --> 00:58:30,910
That's what I saw from the plane.

854
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:34,910
As my friend Jean-Louis says,
where there's one, there's more.

855
00:58:36,110 --> 00:58:37,470
Look. They keep going.

856
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:41,230
It's like a path.

857
00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:46,350
But how can a car get through here?

858
00:58:46,550 --> 00:58:49,870
Just like a cow.
It pushes the gate.

859
00:58:49,990 --> 00:58:52,070
What is this road?

860
00:58:53,350 --> 00:58:54,470
Look at your GPS.

861
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:56,190
Hang on.

862
00:58:56,350 --> 00:58:57,590
There are potholes.

863
00:58:57,710 --> 00:59:00,870
This road is D191, to Erosse.

864
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:05,150
Eros, pass me the sponge.

865
00:59:05,350 --> 00:59:07,030
Then to Orléans and La Rochelle?

866
00:59:07,190 --> 00:59:08,070
Yes.

867
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:20,070
It looks like an abandoned
hunting cabin.

868
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:24,030
There' are no animals
when there are houses like this.

869
00:59:25,950 --> 00:59:27,350
Let's see what's inside.

870
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:31,910
Oh! Your Canadian cabin
doesn't look so abandoned.

871
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:35,630
The lock is brand-new.
Shall we go in the old-fashioned way?

872
00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:39,030
One, two and... three!

873
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:43,390
There's nothing. It's clean.
It's too clean, in fact.

874
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:45,630
That means someone swept.

875
00:59:45,830 --> 00:59:48,070
Do you have your chemistry kit,
Marie Curie?

876
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:49,630
Yes, Captain.

877
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:51,910
Then before it gets dark,

878
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:54,910
take these little fingerprints
off the lock. OK?

879
00:59:55,070 --> 00:59:55,750
OK.

880
00:59:55,870 --> 00:59:57,190
You're too good.

881
00:59:59,150 --> 01:00:01,630
I didn't know about that path.

882
01:00:01,830 --> 01:00:04,830
I never go to the end
of the property. No one does.

883
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:07,550
I'd be surprised...
It's mowed! Right?

884
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:09,790
If it's mowed, it's maintained.

885
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:12,510
We have a farmer who mows for us,

886
01:00:12,670 --> 01:00:14,790
and there's Ismaël too.

887
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:17,110
Ismaël doesn't have much money,

888
01:00:17,310 --> 01:00:19,910
so we pay him to work
eight hours a week.

889
01:00:20,070 --> 01:00:21,550
That's nice.

890
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:24,390
So Ismaël manages the fence.

891
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:26,830
Yes. Why?

892
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:28,510
You're no cop.

893
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:31,350
I can tell by your mischievous look.

894
01:00:31,950 --> 01:00:35,030
Call the lab and ask them
to compare Ismaël's fingerprints

895
01:00:35,190 --> 01:00:36,630
to the ones on the lock, OK?

896
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:38,510
-OK.
-Thanks!

897
01:00:42,270 --> 01:00:42,910
Tilt!

898
01:00:52,430 --> 01:00:53,510
Thank you.

899
01:00:54,030 --> 01:00:56,910
It's impressive how fast
a Babarman dog can eat!

900
01:00:57,350 --> 01:01:00,070
I timed him.
It takes him 9 seconds.

901
01:01:04,990 --> 01:01:08,070
Fumar mata...
Were you in Spain?

902
01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:10,910
No, Ismaël gets them
and sells them to me.

903
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:13,230
Ismaël again.

904
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:14,830
That's a terrible idea.

905
01:01:15,030 --> 01:01:17,750
Dealing in cigarettes kills.

906
01:01:17,950 --> 01:01:20,910
I called the lab, Captain.
The fingerprints match Ismaël's.

907
01:01:21,150 --> 01:01:24,070
There you go.
And what would he keep in his cabin,

908
01:01:24,310 --> 01:01:25,910
other than vodka and cigarettes?

909
01:01:26,110 --> 01:01:28,350
And it all goes through your runway.

910
01:01:28,550 --> 01:01:30,350
That's also what airfields are for.

911
01:01:30,510 --> 01:01:31,910
That's impossible.

912
01:01:32,070 --> 01:01:35,350
I see everything, know everything.
I make the flight plans

913
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:37,230
and...

914
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:39,910
Nothing gets by you.

915
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:41,910
Nothing gets by me.

916
01:01:42,030 --> 01:01:43,630
Then you're an accomplice.

917
01:01:43,790 --> 01:01:45,070
And so is your dog.

918
01:01:45,270 --> 01:01:47,950
So handcuffs, police, prison,
dog pound.

919
01:01:48,110 --> 01:01:49,710
No, I'm kidding.

920
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:53,630
So where can we find
the cigarette king?

921
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:56,630
It stinks.

922
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:09,070
There are two of them.

923
01:02:11,990 --> 01:02:13,630
-Who's that?
-I don't know.

924
01:02:13,790 --> 01:02:16,190
National Police.

925
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:19,430
-Olaf Longstrump?
-Yes.

926
01:02:19,590 --> 01:02:22,950
That's a dumb name.
Captain Marleau. Step aside.

927
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:27,950
Is that the new Tarkovski?
I saw it. He dies at the end.

928
01:02:29,470 --> 01:02:30,950
Smells like weed in here.

929
01:02:31,910 --> 01:02:35,710
I'm looking for a Mr. Ismaël Diallo.

930
01:02:35,870 --> 01:02:36,630
Do you know him?

931
01:02:36,790 --> 01:02:38,230
He doesn't live here.

932
01:02:38,430 --> 01:02:40,630
When I got a girlfriend
I asked him to leave.

933
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:43,070
Know where he's living now?

934
01:02:43,270 --> 01:02:44,950
No, no idea.

935
01:02:45,110 --> 01:02:47,630
I told you everything.
Can we watch the movie now?

936
01:02:48,710 --> 01:02:51,230
You know what?
You're lying, Pinocchio.

937
01:02:51,390 --> 01:02:52,790
I'll be back later.

938
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:55,230
What did she say?

939
01:02:55,470 --> 01:02:58,790
The lady said she's coming back.
Arrivederci.

940
01:02:59,510 --> 01:03:01,710
Jeannette, are you coming?

941
01:03:01,870 --> 01:03:04,070
Goodbye.

942
01:03:06,190 --> 01:03:07,670
Well?

943
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:12,230
We should tell Ismaël
the cops are after him.

944
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:13,230
Why bother?

945
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:15,150
He got himself into trouble.

946
01:03:16,030 --> 01:03:18,670
He could have blood on his hands.
I'm not getting involved.

947
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:24,510
Are we coming back?

948
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:27,070
No, but I'll sic the drug squad
on them.

949
01:03:28,870 --> 01:03:31,790
Tonight we'll set up a patrol
at the airfield

950
01:03:32,030 --> 01:03:34,790
in case he comes back.
Then we'll catch his ass!

951
01:03:57,870 --> 01:04:00,590
Hello? Yes.

952
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:02,350
What?

953
01:04:06,870 --> 01:04:07,510
Gentlemen.

954
01:04:11,790 --> 01:04:13,230
What does it look like?

955
01:04:13,910 --> 01:04:15,870
He was shot in the middle
of the chest.

956
01:04:16,070 --> 01:04:18,950
I'd say he died
between 23:00 and 2:00 a.m.

957
01:04:19,110 --> 01:04:20,510
Any signs of a fight?

958
01:04:20,630 --> 01:04:21,670
Looks like it.

959
01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:28,670
He must have fought.
Look at this mess: here, here...

960
01:04:29,550 --> 01:04:32,310
Fought or argued.
Maybe he was defending himself.

961
01:04:33,390 --> 01:04:36,150
Maybe he found out
about Ismaël's smuggling.

962
01:04:36,310 --> 01:04:37,510
And so did Alexandrine.

963
01:04:38,990 --> 01:04:40,790
Either way, no more flying for him.

964
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:43,670
Where is the widow?

965
01:04:43,870 --> 01:04:44,950
In her office.

966
01:04:49,710 --> 01:04:50,670
Thank you.

967
01:04:52,710 --> 01:04:53,390
Madam.

968
01:04:57,910 --> 01:04:59,870
I didn't hear anything.
I sleep with earplugs.

969
01:05:00,070 --> 01:05:02,030
You weren't worried he wasn't in bed?

970
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:03,510
We were sleeping apart.

971
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:08,950
Around 4:00 a.m.,
I walked by the guest room.

972
01:05:09,110 --> 01:05:10,790
The door was open.
He wasn't inside.

973
01:05:12,110 --> 01:05:14,590
I saw a light in the living room.
I went in...

974
01:05:15,790 --> 01:05:16,870
And you found him.

975
01:05:20,550 --> 01:05:22,670
4:00 a.m. is pretty early.

976
01:05:23,110 --> 01:05:24,230
I was getting water.

977
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:29,670
Water...

978
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:34,510
And did you find the murder weapon?

979
01:05:38,470 --> 01:05:39,830
Where is the Beretta?

980
01:05:43,470 --> 01:05:45,110
I don't understand.
It was there.

981
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:47,750
Still no ammunition?
There was a bullet hole.

982
01:05:48,790 --> 01:05:49,790
I don't know.

983
01:05:49,950 --> 01:05:51,470
You don't know, you don't know.

984
01:05:51,670 --> 01:05:53,230
Get any visitors last night?

985
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:56,030
Someone must have known
where the gun was kept.

986
01:05:56,710 --> 01:05:57,590
No, no one.

987
01:06:04,990 --> 01:06:07,230
What caliber bullet
do you think killed him?

988
01:06:07,390 --> 01:06:09,230
I'd bet it was a 9mm.

989
01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:10,630
Beretta 9mm?

990
01:06:10,790 --> 01:06:11,790
I have to remove it.

991
01:06:11,990 --> 01:06:13,790
Of course.
How stupid of me. Bye.

992
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:16,390
Jeannette, are you coming?

993
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:18,230
Someone's asking for you.

994
01:06:18,470 --> 01:06:19,070
-Who?
-Raphaël.

995
01:06:19,230 --> 01:06:19,950
What'd he find?

996
01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:24,950
What is it?

997
01:06:25,150 --> 01:06:26,670
and found the pistol.

998
01:06:26,830 --> 01:06:28,790
The fingerprints were wiped clean.

999
01:06:29,030 --> 01:06:31,710
I also found an open box
of ammunition and this strap.

1000
01:06:31,870 --> 01:06:34,510
It's the same as the one
on Alexandrine's parachute.

1001
01:06:34,710 --> 01:06:37,790
Do you think his wife
killed them both out of jealousy?

1002
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:40,230
You look disappointed.

1003
01:06:40,390 --> 01:06:41,310
I'll make the call.

1004
01:06:43,310 --> 01:06:45,070
Are you coming?
Quit flirting!

1005
01:06:56,630 --> 01:07:00,670
So who tampered
with the parachute for you?

1006
01:07:00,830 --> 01:07:03,270
A friend? Someone you paid?

1007
01:07:04,030 --> 01:07:07,710
Of course I was hurt when I found out
Carlos was sleeping with that girl.

1008
01:07:07,910 --> 01:07:09,310
But I'd never kill her.

1009
01:07:10,230 --> 01:07:11,710
I don't know about parachutes!

1010
01:07:11,910 --> 01:07:14,230
You don't. But your sister does.

1011
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:16,950
Isn't she a longtime fan of flying?

1012
01:07:17,110 --> 01:07:18,190
She was your accomplice.

1013
01:07:18,350 --> 01:07:20,230
I don't see Clara anymore.

1014
01:07:20,390 --> 01:07:22,110
She hates me for taking Carlos.

1015
01:07:22,270 --> 01:07:23,390
That's understandable.

1016
01:07:24,190 --> 01:07:24,950
You can't know.

1017
01:07:25,390 --> 01:07:27,390
Well, I'm not Noam Chomsky,

1018
01:07:27,590 --> 01:07:30,670
but sometimes I get flashes
of intelligence, so explain it.

1019
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:36,110
We may look physically identical,

1020
01:07:36,230 --> 01:07:38,670
but we're profoundly different.

1021
01:07:38,870 --> 01:07:41,510
Our whole lives,
people tried to compare us.

1022
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:46,070
In a game of spot the difference,
Clara won every time.

1023
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:49,670
More funny, more brilliant,
more spiritual, more everything...

1024
01:07:50,270 --> 01:07:52,870
I understand,
because if I'd had a twin sister,

1025
01:07:53,070 --> 01:07:55,630
she would've had it rough too,
poor thing.

1026
01:07:55,790 --> 01:07:59,710
I was more serious, more studious,

1027
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:02,710
certainly not very fun.

1028
01:08:02,910 --> 01:08:05,870
Even my parents never hid
that they preferred my sister.

1029
01:08:07,270 --> 01:08:09,950
So when Carlos told me

1030
01:08:11,270 --> 01:08:13,670
he'd always preferred me to her,

1031
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:18,230
I was shocked, and I couldn't resist.

1032
01:08:21,870 --> 01:08:25,550
Did you know your sister
and your husband fought yesterday?

1033
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:26,790
I had to separate them.

1034
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:28,510
She almost bit me.

1035
01:08:28,630 --> 01:08:29,670
He didn't tell me.

1036
01:08:29,870 --> 01:08:31,230
As usual.

1037
01:08:32,230 --> 01:08:35,350
I'm very annoyed, Mrs. Clémence,

1038
01:08:35,550 --> 01:08:38,390
because I have a lot
of compelling evidence against you.

1039
01:08:38,590 --> 01:08:40,150
A little too much, for my taste.

1040
01:08:40,350 --> 01:08:43,070
So I'll ask the question
one last time:

1041
01:08:43,230 --> 01:08:47,310
did your sister know
where you hid this gun?

1042
01:08:49,550 --> 01:08:51,230
I haven't seen Clara in two years.

1043
01:08:51,390 --> 01:08:53,390
She had no idea where that gun was.

1044
01:09:25,830 --> 01:09:27,950
What are you doing here?
How'd you get out?

1045
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:29,870
Through the wall?

1046
01:09:30,670 --> 01:09:31,670
It's witchcraft...

1047
01:09:31,870 --> 01:09:34,110
No, genetics.
I want to see Captain Marleau.

1048
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:36,670
End of the hall.

1049
01:09:37,270 --> 01:09:38,110
Thank you.

1050
01:09:43,830 --> 01:09:44,950
Where is she?

1051
01:09:45,190 --> 01:09:49,310
Calm down, keep your distance,
take a chair and sit down.

1052
01:09:51,630 --> 01:09:52,390
Where's my sister?

1053
01:09:52,630 --> 01:09:54,950
Yesterday you couldn't care less
about her.

1054
01:09:55,070 --> 01:09:55,950
What do you know?

1055
01:09:56,110 --> 01:09:57,950
I'm very curious,

1056
01:09:58,150 --> 01:10:00,390
so explain it to me.
I'm listening.

1057
01:10:01,510 --> 01:10:04,110
When we are together,
nothing can stop us.

1058
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:06,670
When life separates us,
everything falls apart.

1059
01:10:07,630 --> 01:10:11,950
How sad. Poor little rich girl.
And in the meantime, in Syria...

1060
01:10:12,630 --> 01:10:13,830
OK, OK.

1061
01:10:14,030 --> 01:10:16,390
What were you doing last night
around midnight?

1062
01:10:16,590 --> 01:10:18,710
I was playing poker at Réjane's.

1063
01:10:18,830 --> 01:10:21,030
I won a ton of money.
They'll remember.

1064
01:10:21,630 --> 01:10:23,550
OK. We'll check.

1065
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:28,390
And as for your sister,
the judge will decide.

1066
01:10:32,110 --> 01:10:34,390
For the Romans,
Justice was the daughter of Jupiter.

1067
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:37,270
She wore a blindfold
as a sign of impartiality.

1068
01:10:38,670 --> 01:10:41,990
Captain, are you sure
you're being impartial?

1069
01:10:42,150 --> 01:10:44,670
I don't know,
but I bet 10 to 1 you'll tell me.

1070
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:47,830
I think you find my sister
profoundly unsympathetic.

1071
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:49,830
She is beautiful, rich, cultured,

1072
01:10:50,070 --> 01:10:51,830
and a bit too reserved
for your taste.

1073
01:10:53,390 --> 01:10:56,550
That often makes people misjudge her.
But she didn't kill Carlos.

1074
01:10:56,670 --> 01:10:57,390
Did you?

1075
01:10:58,350 --> 01:10:59,950
I would love to, but I didn't.

1076
01:11:00,950 --> 01:11:03,270
I would never have taken the man
my sister loves.

1077
01:11:03,470 --> 01:11:07,390
A sister's love is delicious.
Especially with pastry.

1078
01:11:38,710 --> 01:11:40,270
Are you another sister?

1079
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:43,110
Which wall will you go through?

1080
01:11:44,070 --> 01:11:46,630
I'll go through the door
after seven hours in custody.

1081
01:11:46,830 --> 01:11:48,550
That will be fine.
My bag, please.

1082
01:12:06,950 --> 01:12:09,390
I knew you couldn't help
going through the wall.

1083
01:12:27,390 --> 01:12:30,830
Captain, why are you doing that?
That's your report.

1084
01:12:30,950 --> 01:12:33,830
Yep. Clara was cleared.

1085
01:12:34,390 --> 01:12:37,990
At the time of the crime she was
playing cards with the prefect's son,

1086
01:12:38,150 --> 01:12:41,350
a certain Jérôme Léglise.
And she beat him in poker.

1087
01:12:41,710 --> 01:12:42,550
And her sister?

1088
01:12:42,990 --> 01:12:45,550
Her sister was released too.
It's no big deal.

1089
01:12:45,710 --> 01:12:48,270
We'll keep an eye on her
and see where it leads.

1090
01:12:49,150 --> 01:12:51,390
Do you think they could have
switched places?

1091
01:12:52,750 --> 01:12:55,270
That's a version I would've loved,

1092
01:12:55,470 --> 01:12:57,430
but just know that not everyone

1093
01:12:57,670 --> 01:12:59,830
has your imagination, my dear.

1094
01:13:03,030 --> 01:13:06,430
Let's say that were the case.
Clémence would be a real idiot

1095
01:13:06,670 --> 01:13:10,270
if she left the gun and the straps
in the car.

1096
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:11,990
Would you like tea or coffee?

1097
01:13:12,190 --> 01:13:13,350
Hot chocolate.

1098
01:13:13,550 --> 01:13:16,350
OK.
The gun under the spare tire, maybe.

1099
01:13:16,550 --> 01:13:19,430
But what would the straps
be doing there?

1100
01:13:19,590 --> 01:13:20,710
Why not get rid of them?

1101
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:22,910
Like she would bring them home

1102
01:13:23,110 --> 01:13:25,070
and wait for us to find them.

1103
01:13:25,230 --> 01:13:26,550
That's nonsense.

1104
01:13:26,870 --> 01:13:28,990
You're right.
It makes no sense.

1105
01:13:29,230 --> 01:13:30,950
It makes no sense.
I agree.

1106
01:13:42,630 --> 01:13:44,990
I'm looking for Ismaël Diallo.
Where is he?

1107
01:13:45,150 --> 01:13:46,150
Ismaël? Why?

1108
01:13:46,350 --> 01:13:47,070
Because.

1109
01:13:47,270 --> 01:13:49,430
I saw him go into the hangar earlier.

1110
01:13:49,630 --> 01:13:52,710
The hangar over there?
OK. Come on. We'll walk.

1111
01:13:56,190 --> 01:13:58,430
This isn't right.
You're shorting me.

1112
01:13:58,590 --> 01:14:00,550
It's an advance.
I can't give you any more.

1113
01:14:00,710 --> 01:14:03,270
You'll have to, or I'll kill you!

1114
01:14:03,390 --> 01:14:04,710
You're dead. You hear me?

1115
01:14:04,910 --> 01:14:06,430
You're done, my friend. Look.

1116
01:14:10,550 --> 01:14:11,550
Ismaël?

1117
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:16,270
Yoohoo, Ismaël!
Where is that idiot?

1118
01:14:19,270 --> 01:14:20,990
Hey, Captain!

1119
01:14:22,510 --> 01:14:25,990
The idiot's not dead.

1120
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:27,550
Ismaël?

1121
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:31,430
Dammit! Catch him!

1122
01:14:37,190 --> 01:14:39,870
So we have: one phone,

1123
01:14:40,030 --> 01:14:42,590
a pack of cigarettes
marked "Fumar mata."

1124
01:14:42,750 --> 01:14:44,870
Tu hablas español
or should I translate?

1125
01:14:45,070 --> 01:14:46,590
These will kill you.

1126
01:14:48,110 --> 01:14:50,790
And a little stack of cash.

1127
01:14:51,470 --> 01:14:53,510
How much is there?
At least 500 euros.

1128
01:14:54,070 --> 01:14:56,710
For a guy with no money,
you're loaded.

1129
01:14:59,110 --> 01:15:00,590
I hope we find Le Preux,

1130
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:03,590
otherwise you'll have to pay
for the both of you.

1131
01:15:03,790 --> 01:15:06,950
And there are already two bodies...
How much is two plus two?

1132
01:15:07,230 --> 01:15:09,830
-30 years?
-Yes. You'll get life in prison.

1133
01:15:10,030 --> 01:15:12,710
I didn't kill anyone.
Not Alexandrine, not Carlos.

1134
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:16,310
I just set up a business to get by.

1135
01:15:23,830 --> 01:15:25,030
Every other Thursday,

1136
01:15:25,710 --> 01:15:29,430
Le Preux flies a private plane
to his sister's in the Pyrenees,

1137
01:15:41,590 --> 01:15:45,750
with a rich guy who plays bridge
and comes back at night.

1138
01:16:04,110 --> 01:16:08,030
During the day, Le Preux loads
the merchandise from Spain.

1139
01:16:08,990 --> 01:16:10,270
The border's on the property.

1140
01:16:10,470 --> 01:16:12,150
How are you?

1141
01:16:12,990 --> 01:16:14,310
The guy suspects nothing.

1142
01:16:15,390 --> 01:16:16,750
All he cares about is cards.

1143
01:16:22,510 --> 01:16:25,590
At night, I unload the merchandise,

1144
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:27,550
store it and sell it.

1145
01:16:34,510 --> 01:16:36,710
Oh! What's this little key?

1146
01:16:37,430 --> 01:16:40,750
I bet it opens the cabin
at the end of the path.

1147
01:16:40,990 --> 01:16:41,870
That's right.

1148
01:16:43,190 --> 01:16:45,590
I took the goods out.
We thought we'd get caught.

1149
01:16:49,070 --> 01:16:52,030
I have a daughter, you know.

1150
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:54,870
A little angel.

1151
01:16:58,590 --> 01:17:00,150
If I don't pay support,

1152
01:17:03,230 --> 01:17:04,750
I can't see her.
She's all I have.

1153
01:17:06,270 --> 01:17:09,110
I made mistakes.
I'm in debt.

1154
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:13,470
I need money.
I need to see my daughter.

1155
01:17:14,710 --> 01:17:17,750
But I didn't kill anyone.

1156
01:17:20,230 --> 01:17:21,750
Don't cry, Jeannette.

1157
01:17:26,030 --> 01:17:28,590
How do you recognize
the different parachutes?

1158
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:30,110
Aren't they all the same?

1159
01:17:30,270 --> 01:17:32,270
They have our colors,
for the championship.

1160
01:17:32,430 --> 01:17:34,030
They're numbered, here.

1161
01:17:34,230 --> 01:17:37,310
Ah, OK. But could Alexandrine
have confused her parachute

1162
01:17:37,470 --> 01:17:38,550
with Carlos's?

1163
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:41,470
No. He would've realized it.
Carlos saw everything.

1164
01:17:41,670 --> 01:17:44,590
Ah, he saw everything.
So he saw the cigarette smuggling.

1165
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:47,750
So Le Preux wanted to kill him.

1166
01:17:47,950 --> 01:17:51,550
So he came here at night.
But it was dark.

1167
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:54,630
He didn't turn the lights on
because the dog would eat him,

1168
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:57,550
so he groped around
and got the wrong parachute.

1169
01:17:57,710 --> 01:18:00,750
He would never have hurt Carlos.
They were like brothers.

1170
01:18:00,990 --> 01:18:03,870
Yes, but in the Bible,
plenty of brothers kill each other.

1171
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:06,590
-Captain?
-What is it, Jeannette?

1172
01:18:06,790 --> 01:18:10,430
Ismaël told me Le Preux was going
to where they hid the merchandise.

1173
01:18:10,590 --> 01:18:12,110
OK. Let's go.

1174
01:18:21,350 --> 01:18:22,910
I'm sure he's in here.

1175
01:18:29,550 --> 01:18:31,910
Ah! Le Preux.
Dammit. It's locked.

1176
01:18:32,430 --> 01:18:34,830
Problem? There are always solutions.

1177
01:18:34,990 --> 01:18:36,190
There we go.

1178
01:18:36,390 --> 01:18:38,270
-Is that legal?
-No.

1179
01:18:45,510 --> 01:18:46,750
You look over there.

1180
01:18:50,350 --> 01:18:53,630
Oh, a big plane!
Find anything?

1181
01:18:53,830 --> 01:18:56,310
Nothing?

1182
01:18:57,310 --> 01:18:58,870
Wow! A big propeller!

1183
01:18:59,030 --> 01:19:02,190
It looks like what they use
on gondolas, those big oars.

1184
01:19:02,310 --> 01:19:04,350
The last one I saw was in Venice.

1185
01:19:04,590 --> 01:19:07,750
No, the last time I saw one
was at Cambelle Manor.

1186
01:19:07,950 --> 01:19:09,070
Like Campbell's Soup.

1187
01:19:20,390 --> 01:19:22,470
Come see this, Captain.

1188
01:19:26,030 --> 01:19:28,470
Here. It will go faster with this.
You don't smoke?

1189
01:19:28,670 --> 01:19:30,030
-No.
-OK then!

1190
01:19:30,190 --> 01:19:31,910
Let's seize it all.

1191
01:19:33,670 --> 01:19:35,150
What is all this?

1192
01:19:36,070 --> 01:19:38,310
Does he smuggle medicine too?

1193
01:19:40,310 --> 01:19:42,470
I know someone who can tell me
what this is.

1194
01:19:49,070 --> 01:19:52,310
It's Marleau! Can you help me?

1195
01:19:54,270 --> 01:19:57,190
Marleau! You know how much
I love helping you!

1196
01:19:57,390 --> 01:19:59,910
If I say Betaxol

1197
01:20:00,070 --> 01:20:01,910
and Duretine 500,

1198
01:20:02,750 --> 01:20:05,350
what would you say?

1199
01:20:05,550 --> 01:20:09,350
You're dealing with someone
with a very bad heart.

1200
01:20:10,070 --> 01:20:12,870
What does your patient do
for a living?

1201
01:20:13,550 --> 01:20:15,910
He repairs Soviet planes
or something.

1202
01:20:16,110 --> 01:20:17,870
He flies planes and parachutes.

1203
01:20:20,430 --> 01:20:21,910
I'd be surprised!

1204
01:20:22,110 --> 01:20:24,910
Taking all those drugs, the rascal!

1205
01:20:25,110 --> 01:20:27,630
He's not allowed to fly!
No doubt about it.

1206
01:20:30,430 --> 01:20:32,510
Marleau, I have a friend,

1207
01:20:33,510 --> 01:20:35,230
Dr. Perrotin.

1208
01:20:36,270 --> 01:20:39,710
He's a civil aviation doctor.
Give him a call.

1209
01:20:40,430 --> 01:20:41,630
He's a good guy.

1210
01:20:43,670 --> 01:20:45,470
I kiss your hand!

1211
01:20:46,790 --> 01:20:48,630
Bye, Marleau.

1212
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:54,790
The police?
Ah, Dr. Salaun sent you.

1213
01:20:54,990 --> 01:20:57,350
Dr. Perottin?
Yes, I'll find him right away.

1214
01:20:57,550 --> 01:20:59,350
Dr. Perottin?

1215
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:03,990
Here he is.
Doctor, it's the national police.

1216
01:21:12,150 --> 01:21:14,310
Unfit... for good?

1217
01:21:20,430 --> 01:21:21,150
Thank you.

1218
01:21:23,590 --> 01:21:24,630
My goodness!

1219
01:21:25,150 --> 01:21:26,190
Well?

1220
01:21:26,350 --> 01:21:29,790
Le Preux is done with planes.
He's not allowed to fly.

1221
01:21:30,030 --> 01:21:33,350
You know who told
the health authorities? Carlos.

1222
01:21:34,870 --> 01:21:35,750
He got revenge?

1223
01:21:35,910 --> 01:21:39,030
That's a pretty good motive.
What? Don't you like it?

1224
01:21:40,110 --> 01:21:41,750
I prefer the sister-switching.

1225
01:21:42,350 --> 01:21:44,950
Sister-switching?
You naughty little thing.

1226
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:47,070
I thought you were more S&M.

1227
01:22:33,430 --> 01:22:35,230
What are you doing here?

1228
01:22:40,270 --> 01:22:41,350
What do you want?

1229
01:22:59,150 --> 01:22:59,790
Hello?

1230
01:23:00,470 --> 01:23:01,670
Why the gun, Thibault?

1231
01:23:04,190 --> 01:23:04,950
Clémence!

1232
01:23:10,990 --> 01:23:14,510
You don't have to shout.
It's just us.

1233
01:23:14,710 --> 01:23:16,470
Don't be afraid, Clara.

1234
01:23:16,630 --> 01:23:19,110
Carlos is dead.
He paid for his mistakes.

1235
01:23:19,310 --> 01:23:21,190
He begged me before he died...

1236
01:23:21,350 --> 01:23:25,510
He asked me...
No, he asked us...

1237
01:23:42,510 --> 01:23:46,030
Answer the phone.
I can't pick up. I'm driving!

1238
01:23:47,790 --> 01:23:49,110
Thank you.
Hello?

1239
01:23:49,470 --> 01:23:51,910
Captain Marleau?
My sister is in danger.

1240
01:23:52,030 --> 01:23:53,750
Yes. From Thibault Le Preux?

1241
01:23:53,870 --> 01:23:54,670
Yes.

1242
01:23:54,870 --> 01:23:58,030
I know.
OK, OK. We'll send you a car.

1243
01:23:58,230 --> 01:24:01,910
Yes. Hang up.
Turn on the siren, sweetie.

1244
01:24:09,710 --> 01:24:11,390
Don't look at me like that.

1245
01:24:13,910 --> 01:24:15,670
Did you kill the girl?

1246
01:24:15,910 --> 01:24:18,350
She died, yes.
But I didn't mean to.

1247
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:20,950
I drank and made a mistake.
Carlos should have died.

1248
01:24:21,910 --> 01:24:25,550
So after you made a mistake,
you fixed it? How persistent of you!

1249
01:24:25,750 --> 01:24:28,910
He read the coroner's report
and realized it was me.

1250
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:30,390
Why'd you want to kill him?

1251
01:24:30,550 --> 01:24:32,230
Because I have a heart problem.

1252
01:24:33,230 --> 01:24:36,030
And Carlos knew.
He didn't want to cover for me

1253
01:24:36,230 --> 01:24:38,790
and wanted to keep me from flying.
You understand!

1254
01:24:38,950 --> 01:24:40,830
It's more than cruel!
It's inhuman!

1255
01:24:44,310 --> 01:24:45,670
Thibault, you're sick.

1256
01:24:46,470 --> 01:24:48,910
I've known a long time.
I covered for you, but...

1257
01:24:49,070 --> 01:24:52,950
I can't anymore. I'm done.
I can't take that risk.

1258
01:24:53,190 --> 01:24:55,390
If I can't fly,
I may as well kill myself.

1259
01:24:55,550 --> 01:24:56,950
Stop. Don't say that.

1260
01:24:58,990 --> 01:25:02,550
Isidore will take over for you.

1261
01:25:02,710 --> 01:25:03,910
I'm sorry, old man.

1262
01:25:04,030 --> 01:25:06,470
It's nothing against you.

1263
01:25:07,750 --> 01:25:09,110
It's just too dangerous.

1264
01:25:15,910 --> 01:25:16,950
Then there was you.

1265
01:25:18,710 --> 01:25:19,470
What about me?

1266
01:25:19,790 --> 01:25:22,470
I love you, Clara.
I've always loved you.

1267
01:25:24,590 --> 01:25:26,910
And you chose Carlos.

1268
01:25:31,910 --> 01:25:33,270
So what now?

1269
01:25:34,030 --> 01:25:35,950
Let's go away together.

1270
01:25:36,110 --> 01:25:38,270
I'll take you far away,
far from here,

1271
01:25:38,470 --> 01:25:41,230
far from your sister,
far from all this mess.

1272
01:25:42,230 --> 01:25:45,630
I love you, you know.
I love you.

1273
01:25:45,790 --> 01:25:49,110
It feels so good
to be able to tell you that.

1274
01:25:49,990 --> 01:25:52,550
Kiss me, darling. Kiss...

1275
01:26:02,030 --> 01:26:05,710
Captain. It's the only room
in the house with a light on.

1276
01:26:05,950 --> 01:26:07,950
All the others are dark.
They must be there.

1277
01:26:08,110 --> 01:26:09,390
OK. Let's go see.

1278
01:26:19,510 --> 01:26:20,550
What are you doing?

1279
01:26:20,710 --> 01:26:21,430
Coming with you!

1280
01:26:21,670 --> 01:26:25,190
Are you crazy? It's too dangerous.
You stay here. She's insane!

1281
01:26:25,310 --> 01:26:26,510
And what do I do?

1282
01:26:27,950 --> 01:26:31,310
Stay by the window.
Stay with your friends, OK?

1283
01:26:36,910 --> 01:26:38,430
Don't worry. It will be fine.

1284
01:26:52,390 --> 01:26:53,670
What are you doing here?

1285
01:26:54,510 --> 01:26:55,670
Go back to Jeannette.

1286
01:26:57,390 --> 01:27:00,430
She's insane, that one.
Are you ready?

1287
01:27:00,670 --> 01:27:02,110
Yes. Ready.

1288
01:27:10,270 --> 01:27:12,270
Don't move!

1289
01:27:13,150 --> 01:27:15,350
Back up. Let us go.

1290
01:27:15,790 --> 01:27:16,990
-Let her go.
-Clara!

1291
01:27:17,630 --> 01:27:19,950
Get out of here, Clémence!
Get out of here!

1292
01:27:21,030 --> 01:27:22,270
Don't move.

1293
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:24,550
Go, Clémence! Get out of here.

1294
01:27:26,390 --> 01:27:28,430
Back off, Clémence!

1295
01:27:28,590 --> 01:27:31,710
Don't move. Come on, guys!

1296
01:27:35,790 --> 01:27:36,710
Get out of here.

1297
01:28:39,790 --> 01:28:42,310
Carlos will be among the clouds,
like he wanted.

1298
01:28:42,590 --> 01:28:43,550
I think, anyway.

1299
01:28:45,270 --> 01:28:49,110
We never talked about death
or immobility.

1300
01:28:51,470 --> 01:28:54,110
We thought we were invincible.
He did, anyway.

1301
01:28:54,230 --> 01:28:57,550
He thought being in the sky

1302
01:28:59,310 --> 01:29:00,830
made him immortal.

1303
01:29:20,790 --> 01:29:24,390
Go on, cry.
It's good for you.

1304
01:31:18,390 --> 01:31:20,350
I would've liked a twin sister.

1305
01:31:21,230 --> 01:31:23,030
A pretty little thing, like me.

1306
01:31:24,070 --> 01:31:28,030
But too much beauty in one family
wouldn't be elegant.

1307
01:32:37,510 --> 01:32:39,550
