1
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,760
Josephine!

2
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,080
Josephine, are you there?

3
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,560
Open the door, for God's sake!
I know you're in!

4
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,560
Come on, Jo!

5
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,800
I'm sorry about yesterday.
I was angry.

6
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,840
I didn't mean to hurt you.

7
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,640
I'm sorry. Open up!

8
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,080
I can explain.

9
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,360
Shit.

10
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,720
BETWEEN WINDS AND TIDES

11
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:40,280
No to the marina!
No to the marina!

12
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,320
These fanatics
could scupper the project.

13
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,400
They'll soon tire of screaming.

14
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,720
- No, they're not kids.
- You're right.

15
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,440
Kids wouldn't be such a pain.
A spanking and off to bed!

16
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,680
- You should talk to them.
- And say what?

17
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,560
That it will improve their lives?
That they can play golf

18
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,960
and paddle in the infinity pool?

19
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,960
This marina is a special place.
Do you see?

20
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,520
It's a bridge between sea and land,
between wind and...

21
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,960
Believe me, the guys outside

22
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,320
won't be won over
by your megalomaniac arguments.

23
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,240
Tell them it's going to create
many jobs.

24
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,520
You're aiming to swap their trawlers
for yachts!

25
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,960
They're not stupid.
Everyone knows

26
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,520
the marina isn't a charity!

27
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,880
Everyone can enjoy
the scenery.

28
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,600
Oh, that's good!
That's what you should tell them.

29
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,680
Your clients will throw them
peanuts

30
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,560
over the railings
of your fortified city.

31
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,880
I don't understand you.

32
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,240
Nadia, are you no longer
behind the project?

33
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,720
But of course.
Only I'm not deluding myself.

34
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,880
You're building the Tower of Babel,
I'm preparing the elections.

35
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,280
I don't claim to be doing it
for the good of mankind.

36
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,800
Listen... I still think
you should speak to them.

37
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,400
I don't know... To reassure them.
Meet their spokesperson.

38
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,120
Their spokesperson is your sister.

39
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,240
She's always been a pain.

40
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,960
Even when it comes
to the Christmas menu.

41
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,720
She's a loudmouth.
What can I do about it? Muzzle her?

42
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,280
There's a thought!

43
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,320
Even with a muzzle on

44
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,440
she could bite.

45
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,000
Bastards!

46
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,040
No to the marina!

47
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,000
If the mayor refuses to see us,

48
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,560
we'll smash everything up!

49
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,840
I'll smash everything!

50
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,800
Your sister-in-law can't ignore you.

51
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,600
You'd be surprised!

52
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,720
She despises me.
Think we might dirty your carpet?

53
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,240
Family meals must be a laugh!

54
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,040
She doesn't come to them.
She thinks I smell of fish!

55
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,960
Look at them! The king and queen
are at the balcony!

56
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,680
They might throw us some coins!

57
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,760
Sailor

58
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,120
Her skin is soft, take her with you

59
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,760
Make her relive
her childhood memories

60
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,680
What's Vincent up to?
He should be here already.

61
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,680
You look lost without him,
the providential man.

62
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,400
- Without him, no marina.
- Without his money, you mean.

63
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,480
Blood red suits you.
You'd think it was invented for you.

64
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,840
Hello, Vincent. How are you?

65
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,120
Look, I've finished the model.

66
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,480
I've done one too, in 3-D.

67
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,840
Look.

68
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,680
Your sister's boathouse.

69
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,680
Surprise...

70
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,560
The Kersaint-Gilly estate.

71
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,880
The five-star hotel.

72
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,160
The 18-hole golf course

73
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,560
and the lighthouse,
lit from the inside.

74
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,680
Wonderful.

75
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,000
Hello?

76
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,480
What?

77
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,480
Christian de Kersaint-Gilly has died.

78
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,120
What?

79
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,400
No to the marina!
No to the marina!

80
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,720
Am I late, Mum?

81
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,640
- We've been here an hour!
- What can I do?

82
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,400
Punch them?

83
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,000
We're in enough trouble as it is.

84
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,920
Yann, don't!

85
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,120
Are you scared the people
will chop your head off?

86
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,560
Someone's died at Kersaint-Gilly.

87
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,600
- Who is it?
- Christian de Kersaint-Gilly.

88
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,720
Two bullets.

89
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,120
Ingrid.

90
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,720
Ingrid!

91
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,880
Nan, you scared me!

92
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,280
Your grandfather has died.
The police are on their way.

93
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,720
The police? What's going on?

94
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,080
He was murdered,
shot twice with a rifle.

95
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,000
Who did it?

96
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,040
What happened last night
between your grandfather and me...

97
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,720
Don't tell anyone.

98
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,160
- No one.
- OK.

99
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,440
Hello.

100
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,040
It happened early this morning.
Could be a hunting accident.

101
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,160
Really?

102
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,160
What have we here?

103
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,600
The mayor, Nadia Quemener.

104
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,160
Some mare!

105
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,880
- Hello.
- Nadia Quemener, the mayor.

106
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,240
Captain Marleau, CID.

107
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,680
Sorry. I get my hands dirty
in my job.

108
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,160
What have you found?

109
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,160
It won't be easy.
There's mud everywhere.

110
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,440
Finding clues amid all the leaves
and bowels...

111
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,240
I know all the local hunters.

112
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,600
Some drink a bit,

113
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,160
but they'll own up if they did it.

114
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,160
That would be helpful.

115
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,040
Otherwise it'll be
premeditated murder.

116
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,760
That's not so good.

117
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,520
Tell me...
Christian de Kersaint-Gilly...

118
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,440
His estate is in the way
of your marina project, isn't it?

119
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,240
What are you trying to say?

120
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,040
Nothing.
I just thought I'd mention it.

121
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,040
I'm looking for his wife,
Josephine de Kersaint-Gilly.

122
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,880
Do you know where she is?

123
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,040
At home, I guess.

124
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,160
It's big.

125
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,160
I'll start with the south wing,
then the west and east wings.

126
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,240
It's huge!

127
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,320
Hey, ma'am!
I've not found her.

128
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,680
Silly bitch!

129
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,880
Are you OK?

130
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,040
- How do you feel?
- I don't know.

131
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,160
He was an old fool.

132
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,040
You call everyone that.
Even your grandmother.

133
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,840
But there's a difference.

134
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,880
My grandma's a fool
with panache, humour, even cruelty.

135
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,320
My grandpa
was a fool soaked in whisky.

136
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,880
And your dad?

137
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,480
Thank goodness he's often away.

138
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,200
That makes him a bearable fool,
almost likeable.

139
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,680
Have you told him?

140
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,040
Is he coming back?

141
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,560
I guess so.

142
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,480
You look pissed off.

143
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,560
No, I'm fine. It's just that...

144
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,160
I think your dad could have won
the Route du Rhum this year.

145
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,320
Stop living the races vicariously
through him. Just do it!

146
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,320
My mum needs me on the trawler.

147
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,480
She can hire someone else!

148
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,560
And yes, my dad is still at sea.

149
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,200
Jo tried calling him,
but he didn't pick up.

150
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,040
Listen, I'm sorry.
Don't worry, I'm here.

151
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,560
You deserve credit.

152
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,600
My grandma's treated you
like you've got the plague for...

153
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,280
- Ten months.
- Ten months? How awful!

154
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,120
Remind me to dump you pretty soon.

155
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,640
- Really?
- Yes.

156
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,200
Yann.

157
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,920
Josephine doesn't want to see him.

158
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,760
Jo thinks he's a lout.
But I know what she really means.

159
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,880
What?

160
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,760
She's stuck in the 17th century.

161
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,640
She thinks he's below
the Kersaint-Gillys.

162
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,280
Don't judge your grandma.
You can't understand.

163
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,600
I'd like to kiss my boyfriend
without her calling the police!

164
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,760
She's just lost her husband.

165
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,760
Well I've just lost my grandfather!

166
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,200
That kid's got a temper!
Captain Marleau.

167
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,560
I'd like to see

168
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,600
Josephine de Kersaint-Gilly.
Are you the baby-sitter?

169
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,760
I am Ferdinand Lebovitz,
Josephine's doctor.

170
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,560
That's what I thought.
You're some kind of baby-sitter.

171
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,760
Can you show me the way?
Thanks.

172
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,200
Hello.

173
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,480
Wow! That's some place!

174
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,800
Don't let appearances fool you.

175
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,480
Thank you.

176
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,440
Impressive.

177
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,200
Don't judge her
on appearances, either.

178
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,480
Oh?

179
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,080
- Are you coming?
- Yes. Nice rifles...

180
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,520
There are four.

181
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,320
Yes, come in.

182
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,000
Ferdinand...

183
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,200
Hello.

184
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,240
Marleau, CID.

185
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,520
Kersaint-Gilly... widow.

186
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,640
My condolences.

187
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,640
Josephine, you've been smoking again.
I can smell it.

188
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,160
No, you can smell the wood.

189
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,080
I hope you won't lie that brazenly

190
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,800
when I question you.

191
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,960
But you won't question me
with as much frankness.

192
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,640
Right. Question number 1,
a standard one:

193
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,160
Did your husband have any enemies?

194
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,600
- Did he have...?
- Enemies.

195
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,320
Yes.

196
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,240
People loved to hate him.

197
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,920
Enough for him
to take a stray bullet?

198
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,360
I don't know.
I don't know...

199
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,320
We led separate lives.

200
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,040
He did his own thing.

201
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,360
Women? Men?

202
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,960
No, cards.
Women too, I think.

203
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,360
And alcohol.

204
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,640
Anyway, he...

205
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,920
He'd have thought this death
was quite stylish.

206
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,800
Sure. To die alone
in the woods at night

207
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,760
with a bullet in your chest
is very stylish, very classy.

208
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,240
What's that on your neck?

209
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,600
Are you hurt?

210
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,240
No. I was scraped
by a branch in the woods.

211
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,080
Looks like it was
a 5-fingered branch.

212
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,760
5.30. It's time for my series.

213
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,880
I can't miss an episode,
I don't know how to download it.

214
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,680
Goodbye, doctor.
Goodbye, ma'am. See you soon.

215
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,520
Is the questioning over?

216
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,160
She's not stupid.

217
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,640
Even though she tries to look it.

218
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,080
What is that on your neck?

219
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,600
Don't ask, Ferdinand.

220
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,920
Has your father been told?

221
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,240
We can't reach him.

222
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,920
Has something happened to him?

223
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,240
We'd have heard. You always do
when something goes wrong.

224
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,320
Yes.

225
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,520
- You OK?
- Yes. You?

226
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,240
Gwen, come and unload the crates.

227
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,240
No. Pretend I wasn't here.

228
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,680
- Please, honey.
- Mum...

229
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,480
I don't want to smell of fish.

230
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,520
No one'll notice,
other than your PC.

231
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,120
I don't want to revise
while stinking of the sea.

232
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,080
Don't be such a sissy.

233
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,480
You can shower later.

234
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,560
It's such fun to hobnob
with the common people

235
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,920
when you have a handle
to your name!

236
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,640
Your sister bites!

237
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,960
Drop it.

238
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,680
- How's the fishing?
- It's not great these days.

239
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,800
Still, it pays the rent.

240
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,840
I've even bought a caravan.

241
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,240
Not everyone's as lucky as me.

242
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,200
No.

243
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,120
Is your grandma bearing up?

244
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,960
She's not one to talk much.

245
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,920
As straight and pale
as an Easter candle!

246
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,560
When is she going to join in
a demonstration against the marina?

247
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,680
My grandma at a demonstration?
Are you joking?

248
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,240
Is she for it?

249
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,280
She just doesn't care.

250
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,240
When the Quemeners
and their corrupt property developer

251
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,680
come to buy her land,
what will she say?

252
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,120
She'll chase them out with a rifle.

253
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,720
Maybe we should slow things down.

254
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,520
Leave people time
to grieve for Christian.

255
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,680
- What's it got to do with us?
- Are you serious?

256
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,200
They're burying him today.
The solicitor will summon his wife.

257
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,680
Everyone will be watching us.

258
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,560
Who do you think they'll suspect?

259
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,840
His wife.

260
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,840
You're wrong.

261
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,240
Yesterday, the new cop,
the strange pale woman,

262
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,360
was waiting for me
outside my house.

263
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
- Did she ask you about Christian?
- No, actually.

264
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,520
No, she just ate her sandwich
and watched me leave.

265
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,240
- Did she speak to you?
- That's the thing.

266
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,520
She just stood there chewing.

267
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,560
I went over to see her.

268
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,360
Did you want to see me?

269
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,560
Who, me? No.

270
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,280
What are you doing here?

271
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,000
I'm eating my sandwich.

272
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,720
- Is that all?
- That's all.

273
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,120
I left and she stayed there
watching the car.

274
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,800
She might be a car enthusiast.

275
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,720
She's a cop.

276
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,080
If she was smart,
she'd be in a different job.

277
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,800
Your swimming pool,

278
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,280
your casino, your golf course,

279
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,280
your 5-star hotel...

280
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,120
your town on the water,
your glass lighthouse...

281
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,560
It would be a shame not to build it

282
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,960
because a bankrupt aristocrat
took a stray bullet.

283
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,920
Talking of which, Vincent...

284
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,160
Was it really a stray bullet?

285
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,000
- You don't think...
- Sorry, but...

286
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,160
You always insist on remaining
in the background.

287
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,240
What do you want me to do?
Show off my cash?

288
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,440
You'd need three lifetimes
to spend it all!

289
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,160
By the way, where does
all that money come from?

290
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,160
I made a pact with the devil.

291
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,640
No. Seriously, Vincent.

292
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,560
If it's not a matter of ego
or money,

293
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,560
what makes you tick?

294
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,560
That Marleau is a pain.

295
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,080
She's just called me in
to ask me

296
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,280
my nail varnish's
reference number.

297
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,000
I'm joking, but only just.

298
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:27,080
They're all over the place.
Now's the time to strike.

299
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,840
What do you mean?

300
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,360
Ever heard of shock strategy?

301
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,160
What are you doing?
Have you gone mad?

302
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,680
You get people in a state of shock
and you use their distress

303
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,000
to gain the upper hand.

304
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,960
You reassure them
and they're putty in your hands.

305
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,000
So what do we actually do?

306
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,960
Christian's time among us
has come to an end.

307
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,400
Lord, grant that he may
rest for ever

308
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,440
in peace by Your side.

309
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:15,560
In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit.

310
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,800
Hello. Do you want a handkerchief?

311
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,400
I don't have a cold, miss.

312
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,680
Your granddaughter doesn't look
very Catholic, like you.

313
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,560
I'm protestant
and she's a bit of a protester.

314
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,360
And where's your son?

315
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:26,120
- He's at sea.
- Ah... I don't like the sea.

316
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,200
Ah, the doctor. Hello.

317
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,680
Has he taken care of the nasty wound

318
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,240
you had on your neck?

319
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,680
What caused it?

320
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,680
A branch.
Nobody's touched it.

321
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,000
That's right. The 5-fingered branch.
That's funny.

322
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,960
The killer could actually
be at the funeral.

323
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,520
He must be tall,
judging by the firing angle.

324
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,720
Or average height, I don't know.

325
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,360
He's a nice kid.
I like him.

326
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,240
Why did you say
you couldn't stand him?

327
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,560
I said no such thing.

328
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,920
Oh...

329
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,080
The mayor and her husband.
They're a right pair!

330
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,120
- Friends of the family?
- No.

331
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,720
And who's the new chap?
I don't know him.

332
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,520
Vincent Salmon,
a property developer.

333
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,000
The marina was his idea.
He's very discreet.

334
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,120
What did your husband think
about them wanting your land?

335
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,720
He must have approved,
since he sold them some of it.

336
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,560
- It must have pissed you off.
- Yes.

337
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,160
- Post mortem.
- Post mortem...

338
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,800
Goodbye, doctor.

339
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,840
Ferdinand.

340
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,840
Sorry.

341
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,720
Ma'am...

342
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,520
My deepest sympathy.

343
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,840
Your husband was a dear friend.

344
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,880
My husband was surrounded
by bastards.

345
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,520
I forgot to ask you something.

346
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,240
The night your husband died,
where were you?

347
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,840
- I was asleep.
- That makes sense.

348
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,880
Didn't the shots wake you up?

349
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,280
I'm a deep sleeper.

350
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,360
I sleep with one eye open.

351
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,840
- Luckily, it's not a glass one.
- Yes.

352
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,720
Who was that woman at the funeral?

353
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,120
A cop.

354
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,520
A poor old cop.

355
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,160
If ever I die, don't bury me.

356
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,880
It drags on and on
and you get mud everywhere.

357
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,680
I wouldn't wish it on anyone.

358
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,000
You'd rather be cremated?

359
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,880
And have my ashes scattered
like Scarlett O'Hara's.

360
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,880
She wasn't cremated.

361
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,000
I'm thinking wide-open spaces.

362
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,800
What if you stink of fish
for eternity?

363
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,600
- Eternity has no smell.
- Whatever.

364
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,000
Do you think it was
a stray bullet?

365
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,320
Well he was no saint, but still...

366
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,320
I liked him.

367
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,720
You love anything that has to do
with Kersaint-Gilly.

368
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,680
You should hear yourself!
"Not too tired, Jo?"

369
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,680
"Can I hold your umbrella?"
"You're so elegant!"

370
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,240
Well, she is elegant.
And Christian was classy, too.

371
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,720
If you'd seen him reeling after
a poker game you wouldn't say that.

372
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,880
He played poker?

373
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,040
He frittered away his fortune.

374
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,440
He was addicted and always lost.

375
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,760
- How do you know?
- Eh? I forget.

376
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,320
- By hearsay.
- You've played with him?

377
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,760
- A couple of times.
- Honestly!

378
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,320
- You wasted our money!
- It's Mum's money.

379
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,160
- How dare you judge her?
- I'm not like him.

380
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,600
I win.

381
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,040
How come I'm not a criminal

382
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,240
with role models like you?
- It's not as if...

383
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,760
As if you'd ever smoked dope?

384
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,720
Only once. I was very stressed.

385
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,440
Sorry.

386
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,160
No.

387
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,160
- Does she have a boyfriend?
- I wish!

388
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,440
That's Etienne.
He calls every other day.

389
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,880
She never mentions it.

390
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,320
I don't know what they're up to.

391
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,880
- Do you want one?
- No, thanks.

392
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,000
I'm sorry.
I was dealing with another case.

393
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,600
Are you all right?

394
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,280
Have you seen this? Look.

395
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:28,160
I've just bought it.
It's an 1887 Chicago.

396
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,960
Watch it glow!

397
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:37,280
We've known each other a long time,
so I won't beat about the bush.

398
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,960
You inherit the castle
and its grounds,

399
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,400
but also the 140,000-euro debt.

400
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,760
I can't afford that.

401
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,320
Part of it is paid off.

402
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,040
Your husband has sold
part of the land.

403
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,880
Here's the bill of sale.

404
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:58,280
"In accordance with a deed, etc.

405
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:02,200
"Mr Christian de Kersaint-Gilly...
to Mr Etienne Quemener."

406
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,920
To Etienne Quemener?

407
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,880
What did he sell?

408
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,040
The clearing.

409
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,600
That can't be right.

410
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,320
He can't have sold the clearing.

411
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,840
Our granddaughter lives there.

412
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,280
All the properties are in his name.
The deed is legal.

413
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,840
The sale doesn't cover
the whole debt.

414
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,680
You still owe 80,000 euros.

415
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,720
My sincere condolences.

416
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,120
He was like this.

417
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,960
Bastard!

418
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,840
What are you doing on my land?

419
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:12,920
- Poaching? Setting traps?
- Outlining the lighthouse location.

420
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,560
- What?
- The lighthouse. Don't you know?

421
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:19,400
Quemener are building
a glass lighthouse.

422
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,560
It'll symbolize the marina.

423
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,560
You're on my grandma's land.

424
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,160
It's my boss's plot.

425
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,880
That's impossible.

426
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,640
Go and ask your grandma.
Now let me work.

427
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,400
A lighthouse?

428
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,880
You didn't know?
It's Etienne Quemener's crazy plan.

429
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,480
But why on our land?

430
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,280
That was your grandfather's
crazy decision.

431
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,200
Did he sell the castle?

432
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,560
Not the castle,
but the clearing.

433
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:10,120
That's where I live!
What are you going to do?

434
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,280
What can I do?

435
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,800
I'm drinking my tea.

436
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,040
That's all.

437
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,320
We must get the clearing back
and prevent them from building.

438
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,040
We can't.

439
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,920
They've signed.

440
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,080
Dad wouldn't let them do it.

441
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,840
But your dad's never been around.

442
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:34,400
You drink your tea.
I'm going to stop them fleecing us.

443
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,040
Do you want to do something useful?

444
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,200
Of course.

445
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,040
Pass your exams!

446
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,760
- OK, Arthur?
- Fine.

447
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,120
I've got red mullet today.
Listen...

448
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,880
Poach it with a shallot,

449
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,080
drizzle it with melted butter:
your wife will swoon.

450
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:11,360
Good. I'm not in her good books
at the moment.

451
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,920
- I'll have three.
- It's a deal.

452
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:18,120
Maurice, how would you like
to impress your mother-in-law?

453
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,080
Hello. Sorry...
Carry on, I don't want to interrupt.

454
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,200
Never. To what do I owe
the honour of your visit?

455
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,840
Don't be sarcastic.

456
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,640
I'd like to offer you
an interesting deal.

457
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,120
Maybe we could discuss it elsewhere.

458
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,320
- Richard, take over for a minute.
- It'll take longer than that!

459
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,280
Come on.

460
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,520
What's it got to do with Gwen?

461
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,520
Your daughter
is more sensible than you.

462
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,240
I don't want to sell my boathouse.
Where would I keep my trawler?

463
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,920
You would sell us your trawler too

464
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,400
and take shares
in the company with me.

465
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,440
"Quemener Brother and Sister"!

466
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,280
What's the plan?

467
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,720
I have it here, look.

468
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,000
Instead of your boathouse,
there'll be a spa

469
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,120
with an infinity pool and the like,

470
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,920
opposite the casino.

471
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,720
You can see it better here.

472
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,960
Look.

473
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,000
Who'll go to your casino
and your spa?

474
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,960
People here can't afford that.

475
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,280
It's going to attract
a more luxury clientele.

476
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,800
You'll be able to ditch the fish.

477
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,640
Who said I wanted to?

478
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,440
Don't you want to earn 5,000 euros
a month without lifting a finger?

479
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,960
To take some time for yourself?

480
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,960
I take time.

481
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,720
Before going home, I go for a walk
and look at the sea.

482
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:02,160
The sea is beautiful, and it's free.

483
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:09,240
Yeah. But don't you want to buy
your children apartments for later?

484
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:15,360
Do you think your son's
going to do that all his life?

485
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,720
If he likes it...

486
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,800
What if he was to end up
like his dad,

487
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,960
killed at sea?

488
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,800
- Have you ever thought of that?
- All the time.

489
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,000
When he goes out,
I worry he won't come back.

490
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,440
How will you afford your daughter's
studies to be an architect?

491
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,520
She'll do what I did,
she'll get a job.

492
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,240
That's why you never studied
and you can't make ends meet.

493
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,680
Stop thinking about yourself.

494
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,640
Think of your children. Don't let
this opportunity pass you by.

495
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,240
I mean it.

496
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,240
I was just talking to the kid

497
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,960
who's working there.

498
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,280
He's cute.

499
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,960
He told me your grandfather
had sold up.

500
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,360
Your grandma can't have known,
or she'd have been mad.

501
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,120
Of course. Wouldn't you?

502
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,400
My grandparents lived in a caravan.

503
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,880
My grandma used to say: "Only the fox
has silver to his name."

504
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,360
Whereas your grandma
wouldn't be pleased about it.

505
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,080
Jo doesn't let herself
be messed about.

506
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:23,960
Fair enough.

507
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,400
I wouldn't let my husband
sell my clearing.

508
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:32,600
I don't have a clearing or a husband.
But Josephine is right to fight it.

509
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,960
Have you seen the marks
on her neck?

510
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,880
All for a clearing!

511
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,160
It wasn't just about the clearing.

512
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,680
Really? I thought it was
because of the clearing.

513
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,080
The bank had called her
and demanded 8,000 euros.

514
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,680
Josephine told me.
She said to your grandfather:

515
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,000
"You're gambling away
your granddaughter's inheritance!"

516
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,280
He lost it and grabbed her throat

517
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,880
and said: "Shut up, woman!"

518
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,000
Not only that.
He shrieked so much I was scared.

519
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,960
I went out, he left,
and I never saw him again.

520
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,720
The next day he was dead.

521
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,600
See?

522
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,240
Your granddaughter
talks more than you do.

523
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,960
What did you say?

524
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,680
You didn't know?

525
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,880
- You tricked me?
- I didn't trick anyone.

526
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,160
People trick themselves.

527
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,560
Don't they?

528
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,040
Goodbye, ma'am.

529
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,120
- What did you say?
- I'm sorry.

530
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,240
Hey! You're a nutcase!

531
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,120
You're...

532
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,040
Do you enjoy scaring me
or what?

533
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,120
Creeping up on me like a cat.

534
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,760
Shock technique.
Remember?

535
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:56,080
Sideration. Now you'll be willing
to offer me a drink.

536
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,120
So, your sister?

537
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,600
She decided
she needed time to think.

538
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,520
Typical.

539
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,400
Anything to save face.

540
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,560
She has to sell.

541
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,440
As long as her boathouse is standing,
there's no project.

542
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,160
Don't exaggerate.

543
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,560
We don't need the infinity pool.

544
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,040
People will pay for the view.

545
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,960
Without that view, no marina.

546
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,440
That's the opposite
of what my sister says.

547
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,160
My sister says:
"You can't buy the sea."

548
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,840
She's naive.

549
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,920
In Greece, tour operators
have accomplished a miracle:

550
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,280
they sell the sunset.

551
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,720
People could watch it anywhere.

552
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,160
But some guys in an office
had a brainwave:

553
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:46,440
they convinced tourists to pay
to watch it together in one place.

554
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,400
Genius!

555
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,840
That's a first-class con.

556
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,240
They're not forcing anyone.

557
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,120
My sister says the marina
will drive prices up,

558
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,680
and that the fishermen
will have to leave.

559
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,600
So she's not naive.

560
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,600
But I think I hit a nerve:

561
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,280
her children.

562
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,320
Gwen, come here!

563
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,840
Gwen!

564
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,120
Come and do some housework.

565
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,200
Or is it too tiring?

566
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,440
Jerk!

567
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,440
That's enough!

568
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,160
Take a break.

569
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,400
We need to talk seriously.

570
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,440
Your uncle came to ask me to sell him

571
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,400
the boathouse and the trawler.

572
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,400
For the marina?
Never!

573
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,560
Wait, keep a cool head.

574
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,840
It's a generous offer.
Enough to start you off in life.

575
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:54,680
What about Richard?
He won't get another job at his age.

576
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,720
I know.

577
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,120
But your sister could concentrate
on her studies

578
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,200
without needing to get a job.

579
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:05,480
Tell her you'd rather work
than put a man out of work!

580
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:10,880
His wife's in a wheelchair.
His salary is hardly enough as it is.

581
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,120
I'm for the marina.

582
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,200
What? Are you having a laugh?

583
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,280
The world is changing.

584
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,680
We're not going to fish cod
forever!

585
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:24,280
You want to sail around the world,
and now's your chance.

586
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,720
So I sail to the Caribbean
and leave Richard to croak?

587
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,320
But Uncle's project
will create dozens of jobs!

588
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,120
Have you seen it?

589
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:37,360
It'll turn the village
into a fortress for millionaires.

590
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,480
Do you want to watch them
eating lobster

591
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,600
while we won't be able
to afford hake?

592
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,040
I'll be dining with them, jerk!

593
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,440
Who's the guy planting stakes?

594
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,000
One of your uncle's employees.

595
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,160
- Would you like a coffee?
- A small one, please.

596
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:39,560
My grandfather sold them this plot
to build a glass lighthouse.

597
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,000
But what about you?

598
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,640
I'm staying here
and I'm going to resist.

599
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,440
What if they throw you out?

600
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,720
I'll go on a hunger strike.

601
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,760
They'll never finish building it.

602
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,720
I'll do what Penelope did:

603
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,160
every night, I'll destroy their work.

604
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,360
Have you spoken to him?

605
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,560
He's cute, right?

606
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,440
- It's a joke.
- It's not funny.

607
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,160
What's up?

608
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:11,280
I'm really cross with my sister.

609
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:12,560
What has she done?

610
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,160
She wants Mum to sell
the trawler and the boathouse.

611
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,360
- I know.
- How? Did she tell you?

612
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,600
Not exactly.

613
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,560
She thinks the project may be good
for the town's economy.

614
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,440
Your sister's got great vision.
She's smart.

615
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,160
I know that.

616
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,720
My famous gifted sister...

617
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,160
Next to her, I'm considered
to be the family dunce.

618
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,240
But I love losers.

619
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,880
I'd told you not to
set foot here again!

620
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,040
I'll always be here
when Ingrid needs me.

621
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,160
- Leave her to revise!
- I've never stopped her.

622
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,160
You're a bad influence on her.

623
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,600
Now she wants to stop studying

624
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,960
and become a foreman!

625
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:14,320
You know very well
that she makes up her own mind.

626
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,240
Let me do what I'm good at,

627
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,040
which is dry her tears.

628
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,440
You should follow my example.

629
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,080
Go home now. Go on!

630
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,280
What are you doing here?

631
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,480
Hello?

632
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:42,760
Hello. I'd like to speak
to professor Ferdinand Lebovitz.

633
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,960
Yes. This is Jo.

634
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:46,840
Yes, he knows me.

635
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:50,920
Doctor, Josephine de Kersaint-Gilly
is on the line.

636
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:00,320
Josephine?

637
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,040
Ferdinand, I saw them.

638
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,480
They were kissing.

639
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,040
We need to separate them urgently.

640
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:10,200
After her baccalaureat,
send her to study in the UK.

641
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,680
She'll forget him.

642
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,400
She no longer wants
to sit her exams.

643
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,400
She won't want to leave either.

644
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,480
She's stubborn and...
No.

645
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:25,760
Then there's only one solution.
Tell them the truth.

646
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,280
No, never.

647
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:31,200
I've come to make you an offer,
a very generous one.

648
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,920
- For whom?
- The two of us.

649
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:39,640
It's simple: you need money
and I'd like to buy you out.

650
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:43,920
You've already got the clearing.
You can watch me from the lighthouse.

651
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:48,040
Don't try to be smart with me.
I know you're broke.

652
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:51,320
Excuse me, I have to pour myself
a whisky.

653
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,920
And I only share it with friends.

654
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:54,920
One million.

655
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,760
For the castle and the woods.

656
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,760
No one will offer you a better price
for this ruin.

657
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,200
Go.

658
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,360
Goodbye.

659
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:14,760
You can turn me down once or twice
to save your honour,

660
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,640
but you'll end up selling me
your castle.

661
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:21,440
I'm not for sale,
and neither is my land.

662
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:53,560
You've been very quiet recently.

663
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,560
The boss is getting worried.

664
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,720
The project is coming along well.

665
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:02,080
- Just a couple of details to settle.
- What details?

666
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:07,200
I've bought one plot at the castle,
and the old fool has to sign now.

667
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:10,160
Thanks to us,
she's piled up huge debts.

668
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:13,440
You mean she still hasn't signed?

669
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,800
It's a matter of days, honestly.

670
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,640
Cecile's more of a problem.
She's tough.

671
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,640
Wait.
So let me get this straight...

672
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:29,000
You've made no progress at all.
Right?

673
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,800
You do know the boss
needs this marina?

674
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:37,760
Eh?

675
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:42,200
You do know
we need to launder this money?

676
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,520
We've had enough of your excuses!

677
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:57,160
We're stepping it up. Today.

678
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,640
I understand.

679
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,240
- Hi!
- Hi.

680
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:25,640
- I've brought croissants.
- What's the occasion?

681
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,960
Tarek won't be laying
his concrete today.

682
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,920
- What have you done?
- I took his tools.

683
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:34,240
Your grandma'll be proud.

684
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,880
No. She's letting them do it.
It's as if she was stunned.

685
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:40,080
I want to move it up a gear.

686
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,520
What does that mean?

687
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:44,360
We can't just watch them
concrete over the coast.

688
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:47,800
I suggest we start
actively bugging them.

689
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,360
Oh, yeah? How?

690
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:52,080
We take their tools,
we ruin their work,

691
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,960
we put chewing gum
in their car locks,

692
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,080
we siphon their tanks...
- Yes...

693
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,360
- Yes!
- You're on!

694
00:51:58,520 --> 00:51:59,520
Yes, we're on!

695
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:02,320
- You too?
- I'm too old for all that.

696
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:03,800
I'll resist differently.

697
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,520
I'll sign so the police release you.

698
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:09,080
Thanks.
You're very quiet, Gwen.

699
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:12,640
You just mess around.
I've got exams in four months.

700
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,320
A coffee? Come on.

701
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,800
Enough kissing, now.
We said coffee.

702
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:27,680
You again.

703
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:28,800
Hello, ma'am.

704
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,800
I have a question for you.

705
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,600
You said you were asleep
when your husband died.

706
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,240
But where was he?

707
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36,960
He was sleeping, I guess.

708
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:40,040
I often sleep in my office.
He sleeps upstairs.

709
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,440
An upstairs room?
That's not good because...

710
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:46,360
The coroner says your husband
died around 5am.

711
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:50,240
He was going that way,
so he must have set off from here.

712
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:51,800
Yes.

713
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,680
Maybe he was going hunting.

714
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,640
That's not a bad idea.
Hunting...

715
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,080
Hunters get up
at the crack of dawn.

716
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,680
He didn't have a rifle.

717
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,040
You're Diana the Huntress,
aren't you?

718
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:08,240
What are you getting at?
Do you think I killed him?

719
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,880
I'm not accusing you
of having killed him!

720
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:13,760
Who mentioned murder?
Nobody. Not yet.

721
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:17,320
I'm talking about his shoes,
covered in mud.

722
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:21,480
I walked from your house
to where he was found.

723
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,560
It's about 100 metres.

724
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,920
My shoes didn't get as muddy as his.

725
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,480
I see.

726
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,480
What else do you want to say?

727
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,040
Not much.
I'm just saying

728
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:35,720
that as his shoes
were much muddier than mine,

729
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,720
he walked more than 100m.

730
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:41,880
He'd come from I-don't-know-where,
he knocked on your door...

731
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,560
He didn't have any keys.

732
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,760
So either you were there
and didn't open the door,

733
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,480
or you weren't there.

734
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:52,160
I was behind a bush
and I waited for him with a rifle.

735
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:56,280
- Is that what you think?
- I don't think, I'm a cop.

736
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:00,520
I look and listen, that's all.
I'm just a state employee.

737
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,480
What?
I'm telling you he came here.

738
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,160
- I counted. 1, 2, 3...
- Enough!

739
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:10,760
Don't go off in a huff,
Mrs de Kersaint-Gilly.

740
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:13,280
He was here. 1, 2, 3.

741
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:14,800
Just about here.

742
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,800
Or else he went to the chapel.

743
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,480
He went to...

744
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:23,080
Before the hunt,
he went to pray for game.

745
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:26,200
She's crazy. Crazy!

746
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,920
What if we ran off?

747
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:29,600
Just you and me?

748
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,600
What do you mean?

749
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,240
- Now?
- Well, yes.

750
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,720
Nobody cares about us here.

751
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:39,160
Gwen gets all Mum's attention,
your grandma hates me,

752
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:40,440
and your dad's away.

753
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:43,440
My dad did everything
when Mum died.

754
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,360
He changed my nappies,

755
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,920
fed me my bottle...

756
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:48,640
He even stopped sailing.

757
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:52,800
That's right. I'd forgotten
your father was a saint.

758
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:55,440
Do you know many men
who stay single for years

759
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:59,240
after their wife died
and they're left with a baby?

760
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:01,440
My dad was devoted to me.

761
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:06,360
He knew what ice cream I liked,
how hot I wanted my hot chocolate,

762
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:10,240
he plaited my hair,
kissed me better when I fell...

763
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:12,600
So yes, my dad's a saint.

764
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:16,520
I just need a change of scene.
It's stifling around here.

765
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,920
- Where would we go?
- Anywhere!

766
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,800
New Zealand, Australia...

767
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,760
Singapore...

768
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,480
- What do we have to lose?
- What do we have to gain?

769
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:30,680
We'd be free to love each other.

770
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,520
Wouldn't that be great?

771
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,320
But I love you here, too.

772
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,040
Forget it.

773
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:41,520
I get it.
You don't want to leave with me.

774
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,920
My dad took me with him on his boat
until last year.

775
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:47,480
We sailed round the world
for 4 years.

776
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:50,360
4 years without school,
without friends,

777
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,560
without lessons,
without a timetable.

778
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,200
And I get seasick!

779
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:00,880
Now I just want to stay here,
with my feet in the mud.

780
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:50,080
Come in.

781
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,960
Nadia.

782
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,280
It's nice to see you.

783
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:06,120
How long since you came to see me?
Six months?

784
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:07,600
Seven?

785
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:10,080
You've missed me? Really?

786
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,520
Oops! How about a beer?

787
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:15,480
At 10 in the morning?

788
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,640
Only kidding, Nadia.
I'll have a coffee.

789
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,320
Strong, three sugars.

790
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:28,320
Yvonne,

791
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:30,960
an espresso, no sugar,
and a strong one,

792
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,960
2 sugars, for my sister-in-law.

793
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:34,600
3 sugars.

794
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,120
Given it some thought?

795
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,200
Yes.

796
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,520
I won't keep you guessing.

797
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:43,080
- The answer's no.
- Come in.

798
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,120
Thank you, Yvonne.

799
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:03,040
You can't do that.
If you refuse, there'll be no marina!

800
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:05,520
That's right, there'll be no marina.

801
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,200
What about your children?

802
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,800
How kind of you to ask.

803
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,400
They'll be happy to hear from you.

804
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:15,560
- I wasn't elected to waste my time.
- Quite.

805
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:20,560
Nor were you elected
to put the fishermen out of a job.

806
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:25,160
Is that all?
Get out of here now!

807
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:39,560
Shit!

808
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:41,400
Shit.

809
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:03,560
Shit!

810
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:38,400
- Are you moving out?
- Only my furniture.

811
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:39,920
The bailiff's here.

812
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,640
And you agreed?

813
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,560
I wasn't asked for my opinion.

814
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:48,240
Goodbye.

815
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:53,960
I think you should
leave us alone now.

816
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:57,960
I'll make a complaint.
I'll come back with the police!

817
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,760
Hey guys, leave the sofa.

818
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:04,120
This lady can't sit on the floor.

819
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:05,400
All right.

820
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:12,680
Come in.

821
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,080
I'll make some tea.

822
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:18,000
Come in.

823
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,360
The privilege of old age.

824
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:29,240
- Thank you.
- That's all right.

825
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:32,280
I grew up seeing more bailiffs
than teachers.

826
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:35,920
Over time I developed
an allergy to them.

827
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:39,240
You're not talkative.

828
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:40,640
No.

829
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,520
I like that.

830
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:48,840
You seem to have problems.

831
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:51,040
Yes, and you're one of them.

832
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:54,720
Yes, I know.
Your granddaughter told me.

833
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,400
She told you that?

834
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,280
Ingrid's frank.

835
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:03,360
I noticed.
What are you going to do?

836
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,440
Wait for death,

837
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:10,080
listening to the wind in the trees.

838
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:15,960
No...

839
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:20,240
Just build your lighthouse
and I'll try and save

840
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:24,640
what's left to save here.

841
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,920
- And the bailiffs?
- I don't know!

842
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,840
I preferred it
when you didn't talk.

843
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:37,480
Why is the sofa outside?

844
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,120
You can't just burst in.

845
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:40,960
Be polite and say hello.

846
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:42,680
And thank the young man

847
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:45,840
who managed to save my sofa
from the bailiffs.

848
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:47,640
What's he doing here?

849
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:51,520
- I'll leave you to it.
- I'm sorry, Tarek.

850
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:56,040
Forgive her, Tarek.

851
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:02,320
Stop sucking up to my grandma.

852
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:04,840
You want to take
the rest of her land?

853
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:07,200
I've not taken anything from her.

854
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:09,640
I'm just an employee.
What's the problem?

855
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:12,880
- You like stopping me from working?
- Yes, actually.

856
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:14,920
I can't work without my cement.

857
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:16,840
If it goes on, I'll be fired.

858
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:18,960
That's your problem.
Good riddance!

859
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,320
- What have I done?
- You work for jerks!

860
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:23,840
- You got better to offer me?
- Get lost!

861
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:27,560
One more Arab out of work
won't change your cushy life!

862
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:03,680
Bye.

863
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,120
- Uncle, what a surprise!
- Hello.

864
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:09,120
- Were you just passing by?
- We need to talk.

865
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:11,000
Is something wrong?

866
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:13,960
- No, it's all good, don't worry.
- OK.

867
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:15,560
- Come on.
- Sure.

868
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:19,400
Hello.
Your wife has called 3 times.

869
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:21,240
- Hello, miss.
- Hello.

870
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:24,920
Look, Gwen. There's my project.

871
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:26,520
It's nice, isn't it?

872
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:28,840
The marina represents the universe,

873
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:30,840
the union of the four elements:

874
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,520
water, earth,

875
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:35,000
air and fire.

876
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,280
The lighthouse represents fire.

877
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,840
It's made of glass, it's lit up,

878
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:43,560
and it looks down on the marina
like the Tower of Babel on the world.

879
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:45,120
- Cool!
- You like it?

880
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:47,120
- Yes.
- Take a seat.

881
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:54,480
I've had a chat with your mum.

882
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:55,960
She told me.

883
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:00,680
I hear you're going to study
architecture in Rennes?

884
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:02,920
I'll have to work to pay the rent.

885
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:05,520
That's your mother's choice.

886
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,000
She can't afford much.

887
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:09,040
No.
She doesn't want to help you.

888
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:13,080
I asked her to team up with me
and she laughed at me.

889
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:15,280
And you're the one who suffers.

890
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,280
Don't worry, I'll manage.

891
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:19,000
I do hope so.

892
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:25,240
Thank you.
Your project is great.

893
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:34,000
Gwen,
I've got a proposal for you.

894
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:40,280
Would you be interested
in doing a training course with us?

895
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:44,240
Think it over.

896
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:46,720
We'll discuss it again.

897
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,120
I see the bailiffs have been.

898
01:04:58,320 --> 01:04:59,680
They took my sofa out.

899
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:03,440
- Why didn't you tell me?
- You're my doctor, not my banker.

900
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:05,160
What will you do now?

901
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:08,840
I don't know.
It's going to be complicated.

902
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,760
Christian left me
an 80,000-euro debt.

903
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:13,520
Captain Marleau told me.

904
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:16,160
Since you know it all,
what do you suggest?

905
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:17,520
Come and sit down.

906
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:23,880
- Do you want to sell up?
- No.

907
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:26,160
I love this place too much.

908
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:28,400
We're attached to each other.

909
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:32,560
Do you remember when Renan
played down there?

910
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,280
He'd built a little boat.

911
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:38,120
He would salute
before casting off.

912
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:40,160
- You remember that?
- Yes.

913
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:43,160
And when he pretended
to be shipwrecked,

914
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:46,000
he'd shout:
"Women and children first!"

915
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:50,240
I miss him.

916
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:05,880
That, that, and that...

917
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:07,320
It's all that.

918
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:09,600
If it gets built, I'll lose my job.

919
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,080
I'm 58.

920
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:15,600
Do you think they'll hire me
as a waitress in their 5-star hotel?

921
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:18,560
Could I be a bouncer in the casino?

922
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:21,560
- We have to save the harbour.
- Of course!

923
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:29,000
Calm down, calm down.

924
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:30,960
Quiet, quiet.

925
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:32,960
We'll get organized.
Calm down.

926
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:41,160
- What's up?
- Nothing.

927
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:43,840
- Tell me.
- Leave me alone!

928
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,240
The boathouse!

929
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:47,040
Oh, no!

930
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:50,000
We'd better do something!

931
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
What happened?

932
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:09,320
- Come on.
- Yes.

933
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:14,160
Hello.

934
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:15,320
Nasty fire.

935
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:17,840
Thank goodness the firemen came.

936
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,120
Otherwise I'd have lost my trawler.

937
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:22,800
It's quite a coincidence.
It caught fire

938
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,280
while we were out.

939
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:50,160
Do you have many enemies?

940
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:51,760
Why?

941
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,160
Fires don't start themselves.

942
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:56,600
It wasn't in the engine?

943
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:58,320
It started underneath.

944
01:07:58,520 --> 01:07:59,840
First source of fire.

945
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,840
Then a second one here
and a third behind you.

946
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:06,080
Three sources of fire in one night.

947
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:08,920
That's a hell of a coincidence.

948
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:10,880
How's the fishing?

949
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:15,400
Sometimes it's better than others,
but we survive. Why?

950
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:18,040
No reason.

951
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:21,520
I was just thinking...

952
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:23,880
When a business is struggling,

953
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:26,480
it's good
to claim off the insurance.

954
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:31,600
You think I burnt down
my boathouse to hit the jackpot?

955
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:32,880
Are you kidding?

956
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,240
I wouldn't dare accuse you.

957
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:38,280
I'm just saying
that it's been known to happen.

958
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:41,200
Well, I wouldn't destroy
my source of income.

959
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:42,800
Nor that of my partners.

960
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:45,720
Don't get angry.
Are you paranoid?

961
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:49,200
Having said that,
people are right to be paranoid.

962
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:53,680
So who do you think
would want to light a barbecue

963
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:56,160
in your boathouse?
- Salmon and Co.

964
01:08:56,360 --> 01:09:00,200
- To build their marina.
- Salmon is linked to the Quemeners.

965
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:02,320
Would your brother
have approved?

966
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:05,200
Before he met Salmon,
I'd have said no,

967
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:07,040
but I'm no longer sure.

968
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:10,040
And what do you think?

969
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:11,720
I think they did it.

970
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:15,760
- How's it going with Gwen?
- Very well.

971
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:19,160
Don't worry, I'll be supervising
your internship.

972
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:41,520
Never.

973
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:44,520
Yes. It's settled.
I'm moving in with Yann.

974
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:47,680
Is it because he's not an aristocrat?

975
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:50,680
Don't try and understand,
just obey me.

976
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:53,040
Obey me and don't see him again.

977
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:54,720
I don't have to obey you.

978
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:59,720
You're underage and your dad's away,
so I'm in charge.

979
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:03,400
In 5 months, I'll be of age
and I'll leave.

980
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:05,040
You'll do what you want.

981
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:08,240
In the meantime,
pack your bags, we're going.

982
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,960
They want to live together.

983
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:19,320
The more you try and separate them,
the closer they'll get.

984
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:22,960
So we should just watch them
move in together, kiss,

985
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:24,040
and have kids?

986
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:26,400
Calm down, Josephine.

987
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,640
It's a waste of time.
You're single

988
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:31,760
and you don't know
the first thing about love.

989
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:35,240
- I'd better go.
- I've hurt your feelings.

990
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:38,080
No, but I am a bit stunned.

991
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:42,480
That's the best solution.

992
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:43,960
We'll leave.

993
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,920
But they'll find each other again.

994
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:48,680
She'll soon be 18,

995
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:50,320
so she'll be off.

996
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:57,440
- We'll go far away.
- She'll catch a plane,

997
01:10:57,640 --> 01:10:59,840
a boat, a coach, anything.

998
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,920
They'll meet up again.

999
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:06,320
The only solution
is to tell them the truth.

1000
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,640
No. Never.

1001
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:10,880
- Jo, please.
- No.

1002
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:12,760
Never.

1003
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:16,880
Never. Never.

1004
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:20,240
Never.

1005
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:27,120
Yes. But the terms have changed.

1006
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:28,960
300,000 for the lot.

1007
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:35,480
It's daylight robbery.

1008
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:38,560
Value is not set in stone,
you know that.

1009
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:40,960
Yesterday you threw me out,

1010
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:42,920
today you want to sell.

1011
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:44,480
Things change.

1012
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:50,920
Can you bring us
the sales agreement please?

1013
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:58,120
What are you doing here?

1014
01:11:58,320 --> 01:11:59,200
An internship.

1015
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:01,680
Here?

1016
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:03,120
What's it to you?

1017
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:05,360
Well...

1018
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:08,600
Ask your mum
how she kept her house

1019
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:11,400
after your father died.
With her fish?

1020
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:12,880
Don't insult my mum.

1021
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:16,920
Ask her for her balance sheet
and how she managed.

1022
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:19,200
I don't understand a thing.

1023
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:21,120
Give me the papers.

1024
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:51,640
She left her scarf.

1025
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:57,760
Do you like your job?

1026
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:59,760
Do you hate plants and flowers?

1027
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:02,560
Do you prefer the sound
of the pneumatic drill?

1028
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:05,120
Or do you never think?

1029
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:07,640
Answer me, you bloody idiot!

1030
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:50,240
Did you have an argument?

1031
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:54,120
No. Well, a little.

1032
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:56,280
- Do you know where he is?
- No.

1033
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:58,840
Do you think my brother
confides in me?

1034
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:00,080
I hoped so...

1035
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:02,120
- You OK, girls?
- Yes.

1036
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:04,320
- What will it be?
- Hot chocolate.

1037
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:05,400
Thanks.

1038
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:08,080
- What did you argue about?
- Nothing.

1039
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:09,760
Answer me.

1040
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:12,920
I'm a bit confused at the moment.

1041
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:14,640
My mind's in a mess.

1042
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:16,760
- Do you love him?
- Lots.

1043
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,560
That's not what I asked.
Do you love him?

1044
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:22,120
Yes. A lot.

1045
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:25,680
- Did Yann not come?
- No.

1046
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:28,360
I waited for half an hour,
then I had to leave.

1047
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:29,840
Where can he be?

1048
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:32,080
I don't know. Ask Ingrid.

1049
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:34,360
Gwen says he left because of her.

1050
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:36,120
A broken heart.

1051
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:39,080
At that age you think
you'll never get over it,

1052
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:40,840
and then you do.

1053
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:43,680
Well, sometimes you don't.

1054
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:47,200
What's the problem?

1055
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,400
What should I do with the crates?

1056
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:05,960
Where's your brother?
Richard waited for him all morning.

1057
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:12,000
What's wrong?

1058
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:14,360
Josephine sold her estate
to Salmon.

1059
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:16,800
They're leaving, Mum,
her and Ingrid.

1060
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:19,080
So it's all over for us.

1061
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:20,400
How do you know?

1062
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:22,840
I brought her the papers to sign.

1063
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:26,080
She implied that she
regularly gives you money.

1064
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:27,360
Is that true?

1065
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:32,960
Yes. When you were one,
she opened a bank account

1066
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:35,000
to pay for your studies.

1067
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:37,360
But why? Why for me?

1068
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:42,520
- It's a long story.
- I have plenty of time.

1069
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:46,120
I'll explain.

1070
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,840
When you were born,
I was depressed.

1071
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:56,440
I was in Ferdinand's clinic.
He treated me.

1072
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:58,000
What's the link?

1073
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:00,840
After your birth, I got worse.

1074
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:03,560
One day, I decided to end it all.

1075
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,840
I jumped out of the window.

1076
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:07,440
Josephine was there.

1077
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:10,000
Nobody had heard
of postnatal depression.

1078
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:12,520
She thought I might kill myself.

1079
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:14,120
She wanted you to be secure.

1080
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:18,520
But why me and not Yann?

1081
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:20,280
She was your godmother.

1082
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:22,680
You never told me!

1083
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:25,520
We argued.

1084
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:28,880
It was about Yann, in fact.

1085
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:33,520
She said things to me
that a mother can't hear.

1086
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:36,800
Josephine took care of me
and you nearly killed yourself.

1087
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:39,800
Any other secrets
that I should know about?

1088
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:04,120
I recognized your footsteps.

1089
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:11,520
How are you?

1090
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:15,400
Well, I'm still standing.

1091
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:17,600
I came as soon as I heard.

1092
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:19,720
What happened to Dad?

1093
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:25,680
God knows... I don't know.

1094
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:28,720
A hunter must have
mistaken him for a wild boar,

1095
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:32,680
or maybe it was a mistress.

1096
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:35,960
With him, who knows?

1097
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:39,840
Honestly, Mum! He's just died.

1098
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:43,240
Yes. Sit down.

1099
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:04,880
- Nice party.
- I'll go and see those arseholes.

1100
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:06,840
Gwen.

1101
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,960
Gwen! How lovely to see you!

1102
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:12,040
You look radiant.

1103
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:15,680
Hello, gorgeous.

1104
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:18,840
- I love your earrings.
- Thanks.

1105
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:20,680
Gwen, thanks for coming.

1106
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:23,560
You sounded stressed.
Is everything OK?

1107
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:25,560
I wanted you to share
our success.

1108
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:28,480
This is Gwen, our new intern.

1109
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:31,400
I'd like us to raise our glasses
to her.

1110
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:35,560
Gwen, thanks for coming,
thank you for your smile.

1111
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:37,400
Thanks for being here.

1112
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:40,960
Could you say a word?

1113
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:45,840
Today, thanks to the sale
of the castle,

1114
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,600
we are on our way
to modernizing the coast.

1115
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:52,880
We can bring it into
the 21st century at last!

1116
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:54,920
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

1117
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:06,000
You shouldn't smoke.
It'll damage your perfect skin.

1118
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:08,000
What is it to you?

1119
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:10,760
There.

1120
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:14,440
- Is that how you deal with things?
- You could say that.

1121
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,560
What's up? You look sad.

1122
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:20,680
Family issues.
I don't want to talk about it.

1123
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:23,720
They don't want you
to do things your own way?

1124
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:25,640
I don't want to go into it.

1125
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:28,400
Family... a nest of vipers.

1126
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:31,400
Relax, Gwen.

1127
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:32,840
Live your life.

1128
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:52,600
- What time is it?
- 9.

1129
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:56,840
Already? I'm ashamed.
I never sleep this late.

1130
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,200
My mum says the early bird
catches the worm.

1131
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:03,960
She's wrong.
It's the bold bird that gets it.

1132
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:12,000
Coffee?

1133
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:15,840
- Croissant or chocolate bun?
- Croissant.

1134
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:53,080
We've got to talk.

1135
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:08,160
That was uncalled for.

1136
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:09,640
A little gift.

1137
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:18,880
Hey, what are you doing?

1138
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:20,600
Preparing concrete.

1139
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:24,280
Good.
And can you tell me why?

1140
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:26,720
For the lighthouse.
Don't you live here?

1141
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:29,280
I do, more or less.
And you?

1142
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:32,040
Me too.
Well not really, no.

1143
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:34,280
I came with the build
and I'll leave with it.

1144
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:36,440
The locals
aren't very cooperative.

1145
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:39,600
Do you mean the young girl
who lives there?

1146
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:41,440
Yes, for instance.

1147
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:44,800
- Do you know her?
- A little.

1148
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:47,560
She's my daughter.

1149
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:16,160
You're back!

1150
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:21,160
- Look at me. You've changed.
- You always say that.

1151
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:24,880
Because you're always changing,
getting even prettier.

1152
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:27,720
What have we here?

1153
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:31,160
- Are you an anarchist now?
- It's against Jo.

1154
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:33,440
What's all this
about a lighthouse?

1155
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:35,800
Grandpa sold the clearing.

1156
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,040
And Jo wants us to leave

1157
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:40,240
to take me away from Yann.
- Right.

1158
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:10,000
We're making progress.

1159
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:11,680
Josephine has sold up.

1160
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:14,880
And Cecile Prigent?

1161
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:17,960
I set fire to her shed,
but unfortunately

1162
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:22,040
her son turned up
just at the wrong moment.

1163
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:27,160
The boss wonders
whether you're up to the job.

1164
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:29,160
Stop it!

1165
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:34,280
I've been working on this
for months.

1166
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:38,320
- By playing poker?
- I ruined Christian.

1167
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:41,040
His wife sold up thanks to me.

1168
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:44,400
I'll get to Cecile through
her kids, her daughter.

1169
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:47,480
Gwen!

1170
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:07,600
What's happening?
Where's Yann?

1171
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:10,400
It's not Yann, it's Gwen.

1172
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:54,280
It's going to be all right.

1173
