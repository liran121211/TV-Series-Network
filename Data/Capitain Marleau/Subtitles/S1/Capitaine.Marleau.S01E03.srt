1
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,790
CAPTAIN MARLEAU

2
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:46,230
THE MYSTERIES OF FAITH

3
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,510
-Hello, my child.
-Hello, Sister.

4
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:22,710
How can I help?

5
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,990
I've come to stay a bit in
your guest house.

6
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,350
Did you call ahead?

7
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,390
No.

8
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,110
You know, we have strict rules here.

9
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,710
We ask a lot of our guests.

10
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,150
Yes, I know.
And you give a lot, too.

11
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,270
Of course.

12
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:38,310
I have a duty to remind you

13
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,990
that this is a place of silence.

14
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,990
I promise, my lips are sealed.

15
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,830
We ask our guests

16
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,150
to join our community in prayer

17
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,150
and for some attendance at services.

18
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,590
I've had a long journey, Sister.

19
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:57,990
I...

20
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,510
I'll inform our Mother Superior.

21
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,070
That's Mother Louise, right?

22
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,590
-Do you know her?
-No, not yet.

23
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,710
But we have a friend in common.
Tell her that Carlos Iniesta sent me.

24
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:22,830
I do not think
I have ever heard of that man,

25
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,590
young lady.

26
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,990
Maybe you erased him
from your memory.

27
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,990
Carlos Iniesta
hasn't forgotten you.

28
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,510
He hasn't forgotten who you are
or what you did.

29
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:39,550
-What do you want?
-I need to disappear for a while.

30
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,790
As you'll understand,
this isn't the appropriate place.

31
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,870
No, you haven't understood.

32
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,310
Carlos insists.

33
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,390
I won't be blackmailed, young lady.

34
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,430
This is the house of God.

35
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,750
You'd better believe me,
Mother Louise,

36
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,750
I won't leave.

37
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,310
Or should I speak
to your community?

38
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,110
I could tell them why you came here.

39
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,310
Come in.

40
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,750
Oh, excuse me, Mother.

41
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,750
I didn't know you were busy.

42
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:23,990
Sister Maryse,

43
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:27,230
be so kind as to take this lady
to Sister Françoise,

44
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,510
so she can be shown to a room.

45
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,830
Very good, Mother.

46
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,030
By the way, my name is Manuela.

47
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,030
Welcome.

48
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,550
What?

49
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,390
What do you want?

50
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,230
Nothing, Mother.

51
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,310
I am Alpha and Omega,

52
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,110
the beginning and the ending.

53
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:33,230
Blessed are they
that do His commandments...

54
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:37,030
Eat, Mother,
you've hardly touched your food.

55
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,190
...and may enter through the gates,
into the city.

56
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,190
For without are dogs

57
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,710
and sorcerers...

58
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,870
Continue your reading, Sister Maryse.

59
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,990
And finish lunch in silence, Sisters.

60
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:11,110
Sister Maryse needs to be
with our Mother all the time.

61
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,830
Sometimes it almost seems
that she's in love.

62
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:17,590
I won't let her take up that position
without doing something.

63
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,310
After all,
I've been here longer than she has.

64
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:23,270
If I can put a spoke
in her wheel, then I will.

65
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,550
I, Jesus,

66
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:29,150
have sent my angel to testify to you
these things in the churches.

67
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,030
Don't let her down.

68
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,590
She's so fragile.
Being a liberated cop

69
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:03,750
isn't that easy.

70
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,710
Hello.

71
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:06,590
Hello.

72
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,910
-Can I have a coffee, please?
-Of course.

73
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,750
Is the Ostwald police station
far from here?

74
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,830
No, it's half an hour, maximum.

75
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,350
I wonder if she's got anything on,
under that skirt.

76
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,590
She's probably like the Scots,
with their kilts.

77
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:27,190
-They let it all hang out.
-I'm going to ask her.

78
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:28,710
Stop.

79
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:31,750
-That's not a good idea, buddy.
-What?

80
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,710
Who asked you, Davy Crockett?

81
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,190
I'm a gendarme.

82
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,350
So, what do I do
with your drunken mugs?

83
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,750
Do I breathalyze you
or just take you in?

84
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:46,190
-We didn't mean any disrespect.
-No, of course not.

85
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:49,030
And are girls in miniskirts
asking to be raped?

86
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,030
What?
Go and clean the tables, one by one,

87
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:56,030
with your tongue, if necessary.
And then apologize.

88
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:56,870
Get to it!

89
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,550
Shift your fat ass!

90
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,830
Marguerite Croton
taught me in grade 7.

91
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:09,190
She said you should never give up
on a numbskull.

92
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:12,310
POLICE

93
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,310
Get out and show us some ID.

94
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,590
OK, take it easy,

95
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,870
-it's still early.
-This isn't a campsite, you know.

96
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:26,070
Don't shout, I'm not dead.

97
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,750
What's crawled up his ass?

98
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:30,470
Get out, right now.
You're at a police station!

99
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,430
Open this door!

100
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:36,630
What a ballbreaker.

101
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:37,910
Ow!

102
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,030
My door!

103
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:43,270
I'm sorry about the mix-up, Captain.

104
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:46,510
That's OK, I'm used to dealing
with my colleagues' prejudice.

105
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,510
Come in.

106
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,630
Ah, here he is!

107
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,270
A nice cup of coffee

108
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,470
and some pastries.
That's how you wake people up.

109
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,750
Brigadier Brière
will take you to the barracks

110
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,150
-and show you your apartment.
-No need.

111
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,030
Sorry?

112
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,430
I'd rather go native.

113
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:08,750
Isn't there a local B&B or something?

114
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,750
-But...
-They won't care about my ways.

115
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:15,630
They even encourage them.
Don't worry, Commandant.

116
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:20,150
Brière, show the captain
somewhere to stay in town

117
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,310
and take her over.

118
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,310
I'm a big girl, now.

119
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,310
I can pee on my own.

120
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,470
We were expecting you tomorrow,

121
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:31,910
but would you like
to visit the brigade now?

122
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:36,070
Despite your olfactory respect,

123
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,910
I think I might need a shower first,
Commandant.

124
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:39,910
Come in.

125
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,350
Commandant,

126
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,910
something's going on downtown.

127
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:48,030
A young girl jumped from
her window in front of her neighbor.

128
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,750
-Brière, you go, with Garcia.
-Garcia's not here, Commandant.

129
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,750
The crazy biker was out on the N83.

130
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,750
What crazy biker is that?

131
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:59,950
He's spent the last two weeks
breaking the speed records.

132
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:03,710
He gets his kicks
by outrunning our patrols.

133
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,470
It sounds
like a lot of fun around here.

134
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,350
I'll go with Brière.

135
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,630
Right, Brière?

136
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,350
-Commandant.
-Captain.

137
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,910
Move on, please.

138
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,630
This is not a circus.

139
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,310
She was young. Poor thing.

140
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:15,910
-Hello.
-Hello.

141
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,630
Did you see anything?

142
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,950
I was coming home.

143
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:25,190
I put my bag down to get my keys,
I heard a shout, I turned around

144
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,510
and she just came falling down.

145
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,390
-You heard a shout?
-Yes.

146
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,790
Yes, a loud shout.
That's why I turned around.

147
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,110
She fell down, in front of me.

148
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,590
Did you see anyone else?

149
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,110
No, no-one.

150
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,910
Thanks. We'll be in touch.

151
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,910
There's a funny smell in here.

152
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,110
What a dump!

153
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,950
The Stork Hotel!

154
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,070
That name is like a sign.

155
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,950
The flight of the storks.
Like that girl...

156
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,350
OK, forget it.

157
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:00,510
Anyone home?

158
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,030
Unbelievable!

159
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,470
Here he is.

160
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,230
Sorry, no.

161
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:08,910
OK, I can give you the number
for my therapist. Her name's Olga.

162
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,910
I wanted to see the room
the dead woman was in.

163
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,790
She was up on the top floor.

164
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:14,950
OK, take me up.

165
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,670
Who are you?

166
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,350
The cavalry.

167
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,750
Up you go, darling.

168
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,350
-Isn't there an elevator?
-It's broken down.

169
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:29,590
-You go up first.
-I can't, I have a heart condition.

170
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,350
My heart's racing.

171
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,630
Ah, right.

172
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,670
Wait here.
What's the room number?

173
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:39,030
-It's the Tulips.
-She was in the Tulips?

174
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:43,350
-Yes, she was.
-Now she's pushing up the daisies.

175
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,230
Brière!

176
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,230
The Tulips are on the top floor.

177
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,910
I'm coming, Captain.

178
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,190
What did they want?

179
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,070
I don't know. It was the girl.

180
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:56,270
You picked a good day to drop by.

181
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,190
I didn't drop by.

182
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:01,270
Yes, I know, I meant...
You get my point.

183
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:05,630
You can go out.
I need to be alone, to think.

184
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:06,750
About what?

185
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:10,070
I don't think
there's much to think about here.

186
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:12,190
That's what makes us different,
Brière.

187
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:16,790
The kid jumped out of the window.
It's sad, OK, but...

188
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,070
But...

189
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:19,790
the door.

190
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,790
That door was open when I got here.

191
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,710
And?

192
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:32,110
If you're going to kill yourself,
you shut the door.

193
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,070
It's basic stuff.

194
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,670
OK, let's change tactics.

195
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:40,830
Seal things off
and find out who she was.

196
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,910
And get an autopsy done, quick,
on the kid,

197
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,230
as you wish.

198
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,190
What time do you call this?

199
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,670
-We came as fast as we could.
-Right.

200
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,070
France is good.

201
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:59,230
Mother, please,

202
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,070
sorry, but we need
to discuss the accounts.

203
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:05,110
-The accounts, Sister Beatrice?
-Yes, it's important.

204
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:07,230
-Isn't it time for vespers?
-Yes, but...

205
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,950
-The accounts can wait, Sister.
-Yes, but...

206
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,950
We will conclude tonight
by worshipping the Virgin Mary.

207
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,910
Let's not be late.

208
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,510
So, to recap, her name was Manuela,

209
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:29,630
she had a strong Spanish accent
and paid for two nights, in cash.

210
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:30,950
-Yes.
-Yes.

211
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:33,510
But you didn't check her name
by asking for ID,

212
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:36,790
because you didn't want
to get taxed on her stay.

213
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:39,110
I can assure you...

214
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:41,510
We don't jail people for that,
unfortunately.

215
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,350
So, you said
you still have two people staying.

216
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:47,630
And what were you doing
when she jumped?

217
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:51,790
I was at the local bar, because...

218
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:55,230
-My wife left me five years ago.
-Yes.

219
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:59,510
-I'm surprised.
-I have to pass the time.

220
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:03,990
So your wife left you
and you run your palace on your own?

221
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,790
More or less,

222
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:09,790
but I have a young cleaning lady
who does a few hours a week,

223
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:13,070
to help me out a bit.
-A cleaning lady, right.

224
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:16,510
And what do you call
the room opposite the Tulips?

225
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,270
-The Sunflowers.
-The Sunflowers.

226
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,510
That's less bad
than the Chrysanthemums.

227
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,070
Isn't that funny? It doesn't matter.

228
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:27,950
I'll take the Sunflowers,
because I like Van Gogh.

229
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,870
I'll get the key.

230
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:33,670
-I'll only be staying 2-3 nights.
-OK.

231
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:34,710
Nice curtains.

232
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:38,230
My wife chose them.
She had good taste, you know.

233
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,790
So, the Sunflowers.

234
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,510
-Sunflowers.
-It's a nice room.

235
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,710
That's kind.

236
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:45,990
The elevator's broken.

237
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,790
My God, this is ugly.

238
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:02,430
This is so depressing.

239
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:29,670
What's going on with this guy?

240
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,430
A tourist.

241
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:35,590
What's he doing?

242
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:41,710
Hello.

243
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:29,750
-Are you looking for something?
-Yes, I'm looking for meaning.

244
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:30,790
Captain Marleau.

245
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:34,390
I've got a couple
of mystic-legal questions to ask.

246
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,230
Please, follow me.

247
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,830
It's funny,
you don't look like a country priest.

248
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,470
You don't look
like a typical police officer.

249
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,790
The job's about more than a uniform.

250
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,430
You've got a nice place here.

251
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,430
Very classy.

252
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,390
Oh!

253
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,470
Do you sleep here?

254
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:02,550
Yes.

255
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,710
I arrived in the parish
six weeks ago,

256
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,030
but I haven't really settled in yet.

257
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:10,110
You don't like work accommodation
either.

258
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:14,190
My predecessor was an old man.
I'm giving him time to move out.

259
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:17,390
What were you doing
at the hotel earlier?

260
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:18,670
Getting washed.

261
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:23,190
The house of God is magnificent,
but there's no bathroom.

262
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,750
The manager
kindly lets me use his facilities.

263
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,550
The manger's nice.

264
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,710
And why don't you sleep there?

265
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,510
I prefer it here.

266
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,430
These walls have a history.
I can speak to them.

267
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:35,550
To the walls?

268
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,590
The Inquisition burned people
for less than that.

269
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:43,710
And did you ever talk
to the young girl that died?

270
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:44,790
No.

271
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,390
You never met her.

272
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,150
I didn't know she was there.

273
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,030
Ah.

274
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:53,590
Then why did you stop, earlier on,
at the spot where she crashed?

275
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,590
To pray for her.

276
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,910
It won't help her much now.

277
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,390
The good Lord
doesn't care about appearances.

278
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:03,310
Who knows, maybe He'll be
even happier to see her.

279
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:06,190
Tell that to a stiff
and it'll hit you with its coffin.

280
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:11,670
Believing in our consumer society
is more absurd than believing in God.

281
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:15,390
Amen! That's the first time
I've agreed with a priest.

282
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,390
You'll end up converting me.

283
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,030
And what's your take on suicide?

284
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:22,950
-It's condemned, traditionally.
-Why?

285
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,110
Human life belongs to God.

286
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:27,710
Suicide is a rupture
in that relationship.

287
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,550
So, if you're unhappy,

288
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,550
you just have to put up with it.

289
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,510
It's like a permanent job
that you can't walk out on.

290
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:35,790
OK.

291
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:38,110
Do you know this man?

292
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,910
St. Benedict, without a doubt.

293
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:41,670
By the way,

294
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:45,790
when your sinner took the leap,
where were you?

295
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,110
With my predecessor, Grégoire.

296
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,110
St. Benedict was a priest

297
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:53,550
who founded his monastery
at Monte Cassino, in 530.

298
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:54,390
Ah.

299
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,950
The precepts and rules
that he pronounced

300
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,990
are still followed to this day.

301
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,470
Like what, for example?

302
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:02,510
The Récollets Abbey

303
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:06,030
maintains the tradition
of taking in guests and the poor.

304
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:08,590
The Sisters receive them,

305
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,070
with respect

306
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,430
and humanity.

307
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:14,590
Ah! Humanity! Jaurès!

308
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:19,270
-Thanks for your cooperation.
-You're welcome, my child.

309
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:21,350
Ah!

310
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:23,710
Sorry to keep going on,

311
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:26,030
but are you absolutely sure

312
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:28,630
Vincent didn't stop by
the day before yesterday.

313
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:29,750
You know,

314
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:33,830
old age and its trials
are carrying me off, for sure,

315
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:36,390
but my memory isn't failing me yet.

316
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,710
I didn't mean to upset you.
Entschuldigung.

317
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:41,430
I'm just finishing with my move.

318
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,710
I haven't left here for three days.

319
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:44,470
OK.

320
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,350
They don't dust much here.

321
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:23,870
So then...

322
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,270
Small wad, big alibi.

323
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,710
I don't understand, Mother.

324
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,750
I've been over it three times.

325
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:51,710
Money doesn't just disappear,
Sister Beatrice.

326
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,870
I've checked everything,
I assure you.

327
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,630
It's almost 3,000 euros down.

328
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:58,310
Mother Louise is right.
Money doesn't disappear.

329
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,310
You must've made a mistake.

330
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,830
And pull yourself together,
Sister Beatrice.

331
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:05,510
I'm sorry, Mother,
but I'm absolutely sure.

332
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:08,590
Give me the accounts
and the key to the safe, Sister.

333
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:11,310
I'll start over, Mother,
if you don't mind.

334
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:12,310
I'll do it.

335
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,750
Let me, please.

336
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,350
I'll do it.

337
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,870
Sister Maryse, take our Sister back.

338
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,510
Very good, Mother.

339
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,150
You can rely on me, Mother,
you don't need to worry.

340
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,350
I'll do it.

341
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,790
Leave me alone.

342
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,110
I need to be alone.

343
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,590
Do you understand?

344
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:03,310
No one here would steal.

345
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:05,870
-I didn't say that.
-You implied it.

346
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,510
I know it's who you suspect.

347
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:17,270
Jean - because you don't like him.

348
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,750
INSTITUTE OF FORENSICS

349
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,430
-Hello, Captain Marleau.
-Hello.

350
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:33,990
I'm looking for Dr. Gravos.

351
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,110
She's on the left.

352
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:36,550
Thanks.

353
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:40,710
On the left. Gravos.

354
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:44,310
On the left, Gravos.

355
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,830
Dr. Gravos?

356
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:53,710
She was around 25.

357
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:56,910
She's Caucasian

358
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:02,550
and I'd say she may've been
from southern Europe.

359
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,470
Spain, I think.

360
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:06,150
What makes you say that?

361
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,430
Long brown hair,

362
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:10,750
tanned skin,

363
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:13,110
well defined nose and features.

364
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:16,190
It's a bit simplistic,

365
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:18,430
but she's a typical
Andalusian beauty.

366
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,550
Ah, right.

367
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:22,470
I'm from the north.

368
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:25,310
How could you tell that?

369
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,470
You've got a slight accent.

370
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,070
You're a comic.
No, I mean physically.

371
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:33,070
Surely...

372
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,630
your beautiful grey-green eyes.

373
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,270
-They're beautiful.
-Thanks.

374
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,470
Nicely creased.

375
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:42,430
Those are the characteristics
of people that smile a lot.

376
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:44,550
And people from the north
smile a lot.

377
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,750
That's a bit of a cliché.

378
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:49,750
We smile a lot,
we're alcoholic, we're inbred

379
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:53,630
and terrorists all have beards.
It's a bit of a dodgy methodology.

380
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:56,270
-Let's get back to our Spaniard.
-Yes.

381
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:00,830
There's no doubt that she
and the child she was carrying

382
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,430
both died from the fall.

383
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,550
What child?
Was she pregnant?

384
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,230
Yes, she was.
Three and a half months.

385
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:08,990
Oh my God.

386
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,070
Quite.

387
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:12,470
There's something else.

388
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:13,550
Look.

389
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,150
You see, on her arm,

390
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,230
there's very recent bruising.

391
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:20,710
Whoever grabbed hold of her arm

392
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:23,270
did it hard enough to hurt her.

393
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:25,910
So, he might have helped her
on her way down?

394
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:28,390
That's something God only knows.

395
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:32,310
Give me his address, if you have it.
I'll bring him in.

396
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:35,950
The genetic and toxicological tests
will be ready in two days.

397
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:36,990
OK.

398
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,150
Great.

399
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,630
Ah, there are photos, too.
Nice.

400
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:49,790
-A cigarette?
-No, I'm more into grass, to relax.

401
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,190
-Ah, right.
-Yes.

402
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:53,750
If the test results come in early,

403
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:56,710
you can contact me
at The Stork Hotel.

404
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:59,310
Are you staying there?
You're not superstitious.

405
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,150
No, it brings bad luck.

406
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:05,710
If the murderer returns to the site,
I'll be there.

407
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,830
-See you soon.
-Bye.

408
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,150
It's funny,

409
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,670
because in Alsace,

410
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:13,030
the stork is a sign of good luck.

411
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:15,070
It's associated with births.

412
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,710
Your storks must've been on a break,

413
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:20,510
when she fell,
with that baby in her belly.

414
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:23,070
-It's sad.
-Yes, it's sad.

415
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:26,230
By the way, how tall was she?

416
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:28,750
-About five foot four.
-Really?

417
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,990
That's good. See you soon.

418
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:32,470
Goodbye.

419
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:38,750
Hello.

420
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:42,150
I'd like my key, please.
I'm in Sunflowers.

421
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,910
-Huh?
-Sunflowers.

422
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,910
Have you been working here long?

423
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:50,110
Two years. I do mornings.

424
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,630
Ah. And how's the boss?

425
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,710
He's lazy.

426
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:58,230
Since his wife left,
he's been in the local café, mostly.

427
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:59,350
-Ah, right.
-Yes.

428
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,390
He wife left.

429
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,630
And does he try it on with you?

430
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:03,990
Are you kidding?

431
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,870
He's got bad breath
and he's bone idle,

432
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:09,390
but other than that, he's OK.

433
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,630
-How tall are you?
-Sorry?

434
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,070
How tall are you?

435
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,270
Five foot four. Why?

436
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,230
Move back a bit.

437
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,670
Let's see your shoes.

438
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:23,750
Not bad.

439
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:25,030
-Pretty nice, eh?
-Yes.

440
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,230
Come with me.

441
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,750
Come on, follow me.

442
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:32,390
-What for?
-You'll see, it'll be fun.

443
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:37,310
Come on.

444
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:42,070
Act like you wanted
to jump out of the window.

445
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:47,070
-Jump out of the window?
-Yes, imagine you want to jump.

446
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,310
Put your back into it.

447
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:52,350
-It won't work. But if I....
-Hey!

448
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,910
You'd be dead, instantly.

449
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,470
You'd go splat.

450
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:57,990
Like a watermelon.

451
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,430
-Like?
-A watermelon.

452
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:10,550
Hello.

453
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:11,830
Hello.

454
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:15,230
Ah, there you are.

455
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,990
They said I'd find you here.

456
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,510
Bad reputations spread fast
in small towns.

457
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:22,630
You're not doing anyone any harm.

458
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,230
Doing my thing?

459
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:28,230
Brassens, pinball, leather jacket -
Being a priest is your only fault.

460
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:30,070
I knew you'd say that.

461
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:32,550
Shove over and let me have a go.

462
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:33,750
Let the artist work.

463
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:37,830
You know, in Douai, they call me
the Bar Owners' Terror.

464
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:41,990
-Tell me about your life, padre.
-My life?

465
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:44,910
-Like what?
-Everything. About everything.

466
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,270
Everything.

467
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:48,230
Captain, the Church is a mystery

468
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:50,430
that sometimes elicits no answer.

469
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:52,310
I'm happy to serve and obey.

470
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:55,470
Disobedience, padre, disobedience.
That's the only religion,

471
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:57,790
as St. Howard Zinn said.

472
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:01,710
Hot damn! I got three plays.

473
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:02,990
You're not bad.

474
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,990
-Hello, Sister.
-Hello, Father.

475
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:38,310
-Sorry, the cloisters are off limits.
-Sister.

476
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:41,910
-I didn't recognize you, Father.
-That's OK.

477
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,550
I was praying.

478
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:44,910
How can I help?

479
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:48,470
I'm Captain Marleau.
I want to talk to your boss.

480
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:51,390
Or your Mother.
I mean, to the Superior.

481
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:52,790
Don't worry.

482
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:55,750
Captain Marleau is unusual,
but a very reasonable woman.

483
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:58,070
-My Mother...
-If you don't mind,

484
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:00,910
take me to the chapel.
I'd like to pray there.

485
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:10,470
-Prepare the Mass.
-Very good, Father.

486
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:09,070
I believe you asked to see me.

487
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:11,910
I'm sorry.

488
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:15,470
I was communing with your goldfish.

489
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:19,430
Don't apologize.
I'm very happy,

490
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:21,870
if you've found serenity here.

491
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:23,310
Captain Marleau.

492
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:24,910
I have cold hands.

493
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:26,950
How can I help, Captain?

494
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:31,310
I won't keep you long.
Could I just ask a few questions?

495
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,470
Can we walk and talk?

496
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:35,390
Let's go.

497
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:37,910
Ah, hang on.

498
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,230
I want to show you something.
Where did I put it?

499
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:46,510
-Do you recognize him?
-Yes, that's St. Benedict.

500
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:48,910
We sell these in the local bookshops.

501
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:51,470
-Do you make them here?
-Yes.

502
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:53,870
We make all sorts of artisanal items,

503
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:56,430
to help meet the costs
of our nunnery.

504
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:00,230
You're not a bit Spanish,
by any chance?

505
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,990
After almost 30 years here,

506
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:06,190
my accent still gives me away.

507
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:07,550
Hey! ¡Yo también!

508
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:08,630
-¿Sí?
-Northerner.

509
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:12,110
Vengo del norte de la Francia.
Big accent.

510
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:13,550
You know what I mean.

511
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,670
It's funny.

512
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:17,550
It's funny too,
the bookmark that I showed you

513
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,830
belonged to a Spanish woman, too.

514
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,750
-It belonged?
-It belonged.

515
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:25,230
She's dead.

516
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:29,630
She fell. Fourth floor. Whack. Kaput.

517
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,910
Santa Maria...

518
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:33,910
Madre de Dios.

519
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,150
¿Por qué?

520
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:38,630
¿Por que?

521
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,550
Are you OK?

522
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,830
Are you sure?

523
00:34:58,990 --> 00:34:59,830
Thank you.

524
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:04,070
Is this the girl we're talking about?

525
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:09,550
Yes, that's her.

526
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:11,830
We took her in,

527
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,790
in our guest house.

528
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:15,550
How long did she stay?

529
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:17,710
I don't really know.

530
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:21,150
-Maybe a week or two.
-Two weeks?

531
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:22,550
Yes.

532
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,070
What happened?

533
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:53,910
I don't know.
But it wasn't an accident.

534
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:56,990
Did she...

535
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:01,310
Did she what? Commit suicide?
Is that the word you're looking for?

536
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,750
That's what I'd like to know.

537
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:07,830
What was a girl like that
doing in a convent?

538
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:08,910
Eh?

539
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:12,110
People come to our nunnery
to be in silence,

540
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:14,630
to open up to an encounter with God.

541
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:17,990
If she wanted an encounter with God,
she got it.

542
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:20,150
Did you know her?

543
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:22,190
I think she was called Ma...

544
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:24,590
-Manuela.
-But Manuela what?

545
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:27,950
Our guests don't have to show ID,
Captain.

546
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:30,430
A nunnery
isn't tourist accommodation.

547
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,230
I understand, but...

548
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:34,230
I'm from Roubaix.

549
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:37,070
If I meet another northerner,
I'll say hi, local style,

550
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:40,030
and he'll answer me back.
We're from the same place.

551
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,150
Right?

552
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,910
The people that stay here
are called to prayer.

553
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:47,070
As I told you, Captain,

554
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:50,510
this is a place of meditation,
not of talk.

555
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:53,630
I didn't think
it was a swingers' club.

556
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,830
And didn't you ever try

557
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:58,630
a few words of Spanish on her,
just for fun?

558
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:03,590
Our lives here are devoted
to the search for union with God.

559
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:06,710
The only language that I speak here

560
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:08,070
is the Lord's.

561
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:10,630
And does the Lord
speak Spanish or French?

562
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,830
We pray in French,

563
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:15,150
but I often speak to him in Spanish.

564
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:16,030
OK,

565
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:19,870
who did the kid speak to last,
just before she left here?

566
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,110
I suppose it was Jean.

567
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:25,710
He takes our guests into town,
if they don't have transportation.

568
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:26,830
Jean.

569
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:28,310
Who's Jean?

570
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:31,550
He's the gardener and odd-job man.

571
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:33,670
Jean links us to the outside world.

572
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:37,630
So where can I find this link
to the outside world?

573
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:41,470
He'll be caring for the trees,
in the orchard.

574
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,750
Excuse me, Captain,

575
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:47,150
but this news has upset me.

576
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:50,470
I'd like to organize
a Mass for the child.

577
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,470
Thanks.

578
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:07,150
Thanks.

579
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:18,310
All right, Johnny Boy?

580
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,550
Sorry?

581
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:21,750
-Have we met?
-No, not yet.

582
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,550
I'm Captain Marleau.

583
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:25,270
Captain of what?

584
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,750
Is there a boat behind me? No.

585
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,070
What does that say?

586
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:32,310
So, what do you think?

587
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:34,030
What do you want from me?

588
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,430
Come down, I'll tell you.

589
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:40,310
-Get down, Johnny Boy.
-OK, take it easy.

590
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:44,310
There we go.

591
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,270
You look funny.

592
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:56,190
Yes, she was pretty,
but not very talkative.

593
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:58,830
Where did you take her,
four days ago?

594
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:02,230
She said she wanted to go
to Amsterdam this week,

595
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:06,950
so I dropped her at the Stork Hotel,
to wait.

596
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,230
Amsterdam?

597
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:09,750
Yes, Amsterdam.

598
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:12,230
Did she stay long here?

599
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:15,590
I don't know. Just under a month.

600
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:17,710
Are you sure?

601
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:18,870
Yes.

602
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:22,670
All the others are veiled,
so she wasn't hard to spot,

603
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:23,950
around here.

604
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:25,910
To spot?

605
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:28,390
Where were you in the morning,
two days ago?

606
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:33,710
In town at the garden center.

607
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:35,030
The garden center?

608
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:41,110
Yes, I'm not sure if you're aware,
but gardeners go

609
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:43,030
to garden centers.

610
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,750
That's how it works.

611
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:48,230
And cops go to the cop center.
That's how it works.

612
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:50,590
It can't be easy

613
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:54,830
for a straight guy like you
to be surrounded by all these women.

614
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:58,150
Right, but I don't live here.

615
00:39:58,310 --> 00:39:59,310
I live in town.

616
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:03,230
Still, with all those dresses,
swirling around you.

617
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:06,230
The dance of the veils.
Doesn't that get you going?

618
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:10,310
Didn't you ever get the urge
to try it on with the Spanish girl?

619
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:13,150
This is getting annoying.

620
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:15,590
I'm a girl from Barcelona.

621
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,110
Olé! Really? Never?

622
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:23,390
Aren't you getting tired of these
dumb questions? I have to work.

623
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,990
You don't seem that upset
about her death.

624
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:29,390
What do you want me to say?

625
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:32,390
Do you want me to cry for you?

626
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,190
It's sad. There it is.

627
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:35,670
I've got to work,

628
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:37,030
out in the garden.

629
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:37,950
-Yes.
-I'm busy.

630
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:41,670
Your garden. Divine nature. Right?

631
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:44,750
That's much more important
than a kid's death.

632
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:47,390
Damn religion!

633
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:48,590
Unbelievable!

634
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:54,390
Shall we go?

635
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:12,150
You're everywhere, Sister Françoise.

636
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,990
She's truly ubiquitous.

637
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:19,870
Captain.

638
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:25,590
So, Captain, did your visit put you
on the right track?

639
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:27,270
All roads lead to man.

640
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:29,150
-Or to Rome.
-Yes.

641
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:32,270
And you weren't tempted
to take the veil?

642
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:33,510
The veil?

643
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:37,710
A veil for your crisis of faith.
You'd like that, Mr. Priest.

644
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:39,550
I'd like nothing more.

645
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:42,830
That would require some people -
look at me -

646
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:45,710
to find the path of truth.

647
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:46,870
What do you mean?

648
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:50,070
I looked into it.
You weren't with Abbot Gregory

649
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,950
on the day that girl jumped.

650
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:54,710
-Huh?
-Huh. So, what about that?

651
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:58,270
I was with an old lover, Captain.

652
00:41:58,710 --> 00:41:59,990
A lover.

653
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,270
Well well.

654
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,510
You've risen in my estimation.

655
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:08,110
Where can I meet this lover?
I need to speak to her, too.

656
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:09,710
I doubt she could help.

657
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:11,150
I'll still need to.

658
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:13,150
If you want us to be friends.

659
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:17,110
Or I'll have to invite you both
to the station.

660
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:18,430
There's no need.

661
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:20,870
-We'll come to see you.
-OK. Is she nice?

662
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:22,830
-She's jet black.
-Interesting.

663
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:34,790
Here we go.

664
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:44,710
-Hi, you bunch of deadbeats.
-Captain.

665
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:46,870
So?

666
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:48,390
It's all good.

667
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:49,590
Vigier is with an R.

668
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:50,950
-Ah, sorry.
-Yes.

669
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:53,830
-There.
-So, how long? How long?

670
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:57,510
Two minutes, if he's in the database.

671
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:00,710
This reminds me
of my first microwave.

672
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:06,310
-So...
-Those are some ugly mugs.

673
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:07,870
Look. That's him!

674
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:09,110
Jean Vigier,

675
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:11,310
born March 27, 1960, in Strasbourg.

676
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:12,830
It seems we know him.

677
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:15,710
He's a known sex offender.
Look.

678
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:18,270
He was arrested for attempted rape,
in 1985.

679
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:21,750
Speak of the devil,
as my auntie Nicole used to say.

680
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:23,030
I knew it!

681
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:25,030
He did five years in prison

682
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:27,870
and hasn't had contact
with the police since.

683
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:31,150
Then let's bring him in.

684
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:34,270
We'll have a little informal chat.

685
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:36,270
Is Brière listening?

686
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:40,390
Who's going to pick up the gardener,
tomorrow morning? Brière is.

687
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:42,670
-OK.
-Cancel your game of squash.

688
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:45,270
See you.

689
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:47,950
She's incredible.

690
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:53,430
Guten Abend!

691
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:55,470
Is anyone here?

692
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:01,670
This place is so slack.

693
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:06,670
Sunflowers.

694
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:10,310
They should have called it
the Old Poppy.

695
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:12,150
Too much.

696
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:48,750
The sinews of war.

697
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:57,150
The Lord's word.

698
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:05,150
What's this?

699
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:14,470
Isa... Isabel...

700
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:17,430
Judo...

701
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:19,910
Isabella Jura... Jurado

702
00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:30,550
Mother, it's Sister Maryse.

703
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:39,070
I need to talk to you.

704
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:45,590
I need you to enlighten me.

705
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:51,470
Let me in, please.

706
00:46:53,870 --> 00:46:56,470
You know how much
your word means to me.

707
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:29,270
Mea culpa, mea culpa.

708
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:30,470
Mea culpa.

709
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:32,030
Danke schön.

710
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:34,710
You reek of grass.

711
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:43,030
Hello, soldier.

712
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:48,030
OK?

713
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:48,910
Hi.

714
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:00,710
You can leave us.

715
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:02,030
OK, Captain.

716
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:06,590
When I think of Éléonore, my God...

717
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:10,470
Brassens takes me back.
I hate it.

718
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:12,230
So?

719
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:15,070
How's Johnny Boy, today?

720
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:16,310
Well...

721
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:19,190
Sorry, but what exactly
am I doing here?

722
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:22,870
You tell me.
Can't you think of any reason?

723
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:25,030
No. I've got no damn idea.

724
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:26,350
No damn idea?

725
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:28,630
It's funny hearing that word
in your mouth.

726
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:31,230
If you've got no damn idea,

727
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:33,870
why did you try to run
when they picked you up?

728
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:37,750
I'm allergic to cops.
Is that a good enough answer?

729
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:41,630
A fundamentalist Catholic anarchist.
Oh my God! I'm so scared.

730
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:44,910
You know, sir,
when someone runs away,

731
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:48,430
for no reason,
it means he's done something wrong.

732
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:51,590
-If you say so.
-No.

733
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:56,150
No, what I say, is that given
your rather inglorious past,

734
00:48:57,150 --> 00:48:58,310
I thought

735
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:02,630
we could deepen our acquaintance -
no pun intended.

736
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:05,310
Here we go again.

737
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:08,630
I'd like to get things straight,
if that's OK.

738
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:12,750
I'm sorry, but I had nothing to do
with this girl's death.

739
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:16,910
I messed up when I was young

740
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:20,670
and I paid a heavy price for it.

741
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:22,670
Since then, I've cleaned up.

742
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:27,430
God and God alone is my guide now.

743
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:30,590
God guides your step...

744
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:33,190
But when God

745
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:37,390
was leading that girl into thin air,

746
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:41,350
at the time she jumped,
you were in a garden center.

747
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:43,470
-Yes, that's right.
-Exactly.

748
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:44,350
Which one?

749
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:49,190
Oh please.
We're going round in circles.

750
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:00,230
Mother?

751
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:02,910
Don't you feel well?

752
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:05,230
-What?
-Don't you feel well?

753
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:08,070
I'm sorry, Mother, but...

754
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:10,630
I think you've hurt yourself.

755
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:14,190
There's blood
on the back of your dress.

756
00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:16,030
That's nothing.

757
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:18,190
It's just a scratch.

758
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:19,870
-Shall I take a look?
-No.

759
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:21,230
Really, it's nothing.

760
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:23,310
What's going on, Mother?

761
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:26,190
I'm not up to it.

762
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:28,470
-I can't do it.
-Calm down.

763
00:50:28,870 --> 00:50:29,750
Please, Mother.

764
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:32,310
I'm not worth of my task.

765
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:35,190
I'm not worthy of Our Lord's gaze.

766
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:39,310
Of course you are.

767
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:45,670
You're an outstanding
Mother Superior.

768
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:49,190
For all of us.

769
00:50:52,030 --> 00:50:52,630
For me.

770
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:54,230
No.

771
00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:56,830
The Lord knows who I am.

772
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:59,070
And soon He'll call me back.

773
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:04,030
I'm here, Mother.

774
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:06,070
I'm here.

775
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:08,670
I'm watching over you.

776
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:13,230
Whatever mistakes you've made,
I'll always be here.

777
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,910
You know how much I love you.

778
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:18,830
I don't want your love.

779
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:20,190
I can't go on.

780
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:22,350
You can't understand.

781
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:23,910
No one can.

782
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:36,190
I'm worried about Mother Louise.

783
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:39,550
Guard me, should the foe assail me.

784
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:42,030
Call me when my life shall fail me.

785
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:53,830
His alibi is solid.

786
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:56,910
Three employees at the garden center
say they saw him there.

787
00:51:57,270 --> 00:51:58,030
Ah.

788
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:01,550
What about the kid's identity?
Still nothing?

789
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:03,070
That's such a pain.

790
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:05,630
Could you look in your magic machine?

791
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:09,470
Search for Isabel Jurado or Jugado.
Something like that.

792
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:11,230
Look.

793
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:14,070
You see the images in this column?

794
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:18,190
Basically,
that's the young girl's DNA.

795
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:19,470
Ah, I see.

796
00:52:19,630 --> 00:52:22,350
And this is the DNA....

797
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:25,630
from the baby she was carrying.

798
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:27,470
OK.

799
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:32,470
That clearly shows
they each had totally different DNA.

800
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:34,670
What? I don't get it.

801
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:36,350
She was a surrogate mother.

802
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:40,470
-She was...
-Carrying a child for another couple.

803
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:43,670
She made no genetic contribution,
herself.

804
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:47,470
Ah, I see! So is that legal in Spain?

805
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:49,350
No more than it is in France.

806
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:50,390
And in Holland?

807
00:52:50,550 --> 00:52:51,910
No, not in Holland either.

808
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:55,350
-Really?
-Their legislation is like ours,

809
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:56,990
except for abortion.

810
00:52:57,190 --> 00:52:57,910
Abortion?

811
00:52:58,070 --> 00:53:00,630
Yes, it's the only country in Europe

812
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:04,470
where it's legal up to 24 weeks
after the last menstrual cycle.

813
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:23,110
Are you leaving already?

814
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:25,350
Yes, I am. What are you up to?

815
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:29,830
I see you're over
your emotional difficulties.

816
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:32,110
-They come and go.
-That's right.

817
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:34,910
You can climb the stairs now.

818
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:37,270
And how are you?

819
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:40,070
I wanted to say, last time.

820
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:41,510
You were both here

821
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:43,470
when that kid jumped, weren't you?

822
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:45,670
You weren't in the bistro. I asked.

823
00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:49,350
It's true, we were both here,
but we didn't see or hear anything.

824
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:50,990
No way.

825
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:52,830
Are you happy?

826
00:53:53,950 --> 00:53:54,630
Yes.

827
00:53:54,790 --> 00:53:56,350
I'll leave the key with you.

828
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:59,830
-Thanks.
-Keep up the good work.

829
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:01,990
That's that.

830
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:21,830
Hey!

831
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:29,910
What's wrong with you?

832
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:31,390
Are you crazy?

833
00:54:33,190 --> 00:54:34,670
I recognized you as I overtook.

834
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:36,670
Take a look at you.

835
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:38,910
That's a bit S&M, isn't it?

836
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:42,630
This is my old lover, Captain.
My alibi, if you'd rather.

837
00:54:42,790 --> 00:54:43,670
I see.

838
00:54:43,870 --> 00:54:47,470
That's a fine machine.
The cops are all after you, you know?

839
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:51,150
-We all have our weaknesses.
-This one could cost you.

840
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:55,670
-A load of points, then your license.
-Do you think so?

841
00:54:56,030 --> 00:54:57,670
-Yes.
-How's your investigation?

842
00:54:58,550 --> 00:55:00,510
My investigation? It's going nowhere.

843
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:03,910
I'm going to meditate on it
and shift down a gear.

844
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:07,630
-Will you find your haven of peace?
-Have a guess.

845
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:10,350
OK, I'm off.

846
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:11,670
Bye, Captain.

847
00:55:11,870 --> 00:55:14,910
Yeah - drive carefully.
I don't cancel people's fines.

848
00:55:37,790 --> 00:55:38,910
Thanks.

849
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:41,830
Hello.

850
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:43,070
Hello.

851
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:44,910
What can I do for you?

852
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:45,910
You...

853
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:48,950
who have come to spend
a few hours or days in the shadows

854
00:55:49,110 --> 00:55:50,910
of our abbey,

855
00:55:51,310 --> 00:55:54,230
know that you are now our guest.

856
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:57,350
We adopt you.

857
00:55:57,510 --> 00:55:58,830
Did you call earlier?

858
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:01,550
Yes. Wasn't that good?
It was a tribute to Barbara.

859
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:05,270
Wait here
while I tell the Mother Superior.

860
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:06,390
OK.

861
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:14,990
Captain, I won't deny

862
00:56:15,190 --> 00:56:17,510
I was surprised by your sudden desire

863
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:19,310
to stay among us.

864
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:20,270
Really?

865
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:21,670
Why is that?

866
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:25,510
Because meditation and solitude

867
00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:26,550
require silence.

868
00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:32,030
-What are you in search of?
-The truth.

869
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:33,630
What truth?

870
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:36,630
A nunnery is a good place
to search

871
00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:40,830
for the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

872
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:43,150
Why did you lie to me?

873
00:56:43,950 --> 00:56:44,910
I beg your pardon?

874
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:47,990
You said Manuela stayed here
for two weeks.

875
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:50,830
That's not true.
She stayed for a month.

876
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:53,310
Lying is a sin, Mother.

877
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:56,390
We spend our days in prayer.

878
00:56:56,910 --> 00:57:00,230
The days merge into one
and we can lose our sense of time.

879
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,230
To that extent?

880
00:57:04,910 --> 00:57:06,830
If you want to question me,

881
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:09,710
wouldn't it be easier
at the station, Captain.

882
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:11,550
It certainly would.

883
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:14,710
I could have done.
But then I thought

884
00:57:14,910 --> 00:57:18,910
I would go straight to the nunnery.
It's ideal for confessions.

885
00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:19,670
Isn't it?

886
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:23,110
You're welcome among us.

887
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:24,390
Gracias.

888
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:29,310
Sister Françoise will show you
your room and help you to settle in.

889
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:33,470
I would be very grateful
if you would conform to our rules.

890
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:35,390
Good night, Captain.

891
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:37,750
You should stop bleeding.

892
00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:40,110
I'm sorry.

893
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:43,750
It'd be pleasing
if you could show me the signs.

894
00:57:45,990 --> 00:57:47,830
Buenas noches, Madre

895
00:57:54,830 --> 00:57:56,390
You naughty girl!

896
00:57:56,590 --> 00:57:59,430
It's not good to eavesdrop.
I'll tell St. Benedict.

897
00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:00,230
I wasn't.

898
00:58:00,430 --> 00:58:02,830
I was only kidding.
I don't have his number.

899
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:10,950
Meals are served in the refectory.

900
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:13,470
Breakfast is at 8am,

901
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:14,950
lunch is at 12pm

902
00:58:15,110 --> 00:58:17,230
and dinner is at 6pm.

903
00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:18,350
OK.

904
00:58:18,510 --> 00:58:20,110
You will also need to help

905
00:58:20,310 --> 00:58:25,470
with our daily tasks:
serving, cleaning and washing.

906
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:27,990
What a bit of luck.
I'm the ironing queen.

907
00:58:28,350 --> 00:58:33,870
So, here's your room.
The sheets are in the little closet.

908
00:58:34,030 --> 00:58:34,990
Great.

909
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:38,470
It would be preferable
if you also attended our services.

910
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:41,910
I won't need asking twice, I swear.
Ouala!

911
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:43,990
Thanks.

912
01:00:17,590 --> 01:00:18,270
What?

913
01:00:19,270 --> 01:00:22,230
I know it's nasty.
Open your mouth, close your eyes.

914
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:40,910
What's this?

915
01:00:43,070 --> 01:00:44,830
Excuse me, kiddo.

916
01:00:52,230 --> 01:00:53,670
Easy.

917
01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:20,630
Lord, Lord...

918
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:24,470
Wash me of my iniquity.

919
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:27,030
Cleanse me of my sin,

920
01:01:27,830 --> 01:01:29,830
for I have transgressed

921
01:01:30,510 --> 01:01:33,150
and my sin is still before me.

922
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:36,670
I have sinned, I have sinned.

923
01:01:37,310 --> 01:01:38,910
I've sinned against You,

924
01:01:39,310 --> 01:01:40,670
against You alone.

925
01:01:41,550 --> 01:01:46,070
You will be just when You speak

926
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:47,470
when You judge me.

927
01:01:48,390 --> 01:01:49,590
When You judge me.

928
01:01:50,430 --> 01:01:52,510
So, what's in here?

929
01:01:58,230 --> 01:02:00,790
Jurado, Isabel.

930
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:02,590
Thanks, darling.

931
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:04,270
Isabel Jurado.

932
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:07,950
Oh, you little liar.
It's not good to lie like that.

933
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:10,590
Here we go.

934
01:02:14,110 --> 01:02:14,870
There.

935
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:17,590
And there.

936
01:02:19,590 --> 01:02:21,110
Thanks, kiddo.

937
01:02:35,870 --> 01:02:38,590
-Good evening, Sister.
-May Jesus light your path.

938
01:02:39,550 --> 01:02:42,590
Since I met you,
you've lit my path.

939
01:02:45,790 --> 01:02:47,950
Let them be as chaff before the wind.

940
01:02:48,150 --> 01:02:51,870
Let their way be dark and slippery
and the angel persecute him.

941
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:55,510
-See you tomorrow, Brother.
-Yes, Sister.

942
01:04:12,990 --> 01:04:14,590
There you go, Sister.

943
01:04:19,270 --> 01:04:21,630
Mother Louise spent a lot of time
with her.

944
01:04:21,870 --> 01:04:24,630
Of course, she brought her
into our community.

945
01:04:24,830 --> 01:04:26,870
And they spoke
the language of Cervantes.

946
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:29,190
What was Manuela like?

947
01:04:29,390 --> 01:04:31,870
When she arrived
she seemed greatly troubled,

948
01:04:32,190 --> 01:04:34,270
but her time here seemed to help.

949
01:04:35,310 --> 01:04:38,270
Our Mother took care of her.
She was transformed.

950
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:40,670
By the end,
she was coming to our services.

951
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:46,710
I'd be grateful
if you respected our rules, Captain.

952
01:04:47,230 --> 01:04:49,710
Our daily work
should be done in silence.

953
01:04:51,190 --> 01:04:53,270
And our Sisters
should set an example.

954
01:05:01,270 --> 01:05:03,030
The Marshal isn't that easy going.

955
01:05:03,230 --> 01:05:05,550
She's always currying favor
with our Mother,

956
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:07,870
with her irreproachable behavior.

957
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:12,870
Isn't jealousy
one of the seven deadly sins?

958
01:05:41,110 --> 01:05:42,790
I think she's over here.

959
01:05:57,790 --> 01:05:58,510
OK, Brière?

960
01:05:58,670 --> 01:05:59,790
Hello, Captain.

961
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:02,110
I didn't know you liked gardening.

962
01:06:02,270 --> 01:06:03,870
In vino veritas.

963
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:05,350
Here.

964
01:06:05,550 --> 01:06:07,470
-We identified her this morning.
-Oh?

965
01:06:07,670 --> 01:06:10,350
Manuela's full name
was Manuela Iniesta Lopez.

966
01:06:10,790 --> 01:06:13,630
She's niece to Carlos Iniesta,
a nasty Spanish crook,

967
01:06:14,150 --> 01:06:16,110
who was involved in some shady stuff.

968
01:06:16,270 --> 01:06:17,510
Manuela Lopez.

969
01:06:17,870 --> 01:06:19,310
I knew a Lopez.

970
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:22,270
Manuela was booked in Spain,
for prostitution and drugs.

971
01:06:22,710 --> 01:06:25,190
A junkie whore - how original.

972
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:28,110
-But not a very Catholic trajectory.
-Not really.

973
01:06:28,310 --> 01:06:30,590
-Oh, one other thing, Captain.
-What?

974
01:06:30,790 --> 01:06:34,910
Last week, the Guardia Civil
found Carlos's body, in a pond,

975
01:06:35,110 --> 01:06:36,870
just outside Madrid.

976
01:06:37,070 --> 01:06:40,990
I've always said,
swimming is a dangerous sport.

977
01:06:41,150 --> 01:06:42,870
Don't try it at home.

978
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:47,430
And it's harder with your hands
tied behind your back.

979
01:06:47,590 --> 01:06:50,550
You're funny, Brière.
Now get going.

980
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:54,270
-Will you keep me posted?
-If I can. I've got yoga at 10am.

981
01:06:55,590 --> 01:06:59,750
A little drink is nice...

982
01:07:05,390 --> 01:07:06,390
Am I interrupting?

983
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:11,630
We were hoping you'd make yourself
a little less obtrusive, Captain.

984
01:07:13,670 --> 01:07:17,350
Not everyone can just disappear,
like Isabel Jurado.

985
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:21,590
Or how do the Spanish pronounce it?
"Jurado". That's the jota, right?

986
01:07:22,550 --> 01:07:23,270
Yes.

987
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:25,270
Leave us, please.

988
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:28,870
-But, Mother...
-Leave us, Sister Maryse.

989
01:07:29,230 --> 01:07:32,950
The Captain and I
have things to talk about.

990
01:07:34,510 --> 01:07:35,510
Very good, Mother.

991
01:07:43,030 --> 01:07:44,590
Where shall we talk?

992
01:07:44,830 --> 01:07:46,710
I don't care.
I just want the truth.

993
01:07:47,030 --> 01:07:49,950
But this will be more like
a confession for you, so...

994
01:08:12,870 --> 01:08:16,510
I'd never met Manuela,
before she arrived here.

995
01:08:17,150 --> 01:08:20,710
But she brought an old shadow
back to my memory.

996
01:08:20,870 --> 01:08:23,030
A man? Carlos Iniesta?

997
01:08:23,830 --> 01:08:27,430
Did she have to hide because of him?
Was it about the surrogate baby?

998
01:08:27,550 --> 01:08:29,030
She stole it, you know.

999
01:08:29,590 --> 01:08:31,510
She stole the baby she was carrying.

1000
01:08:32,950 --> 01:08:34,270
She stole it?

1001
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:36,430
How do you mean?

1002
01:08:38,270 --> 01:08:42,110
A couple gave her a lot of money
to carry their baby.

1003
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:44,950
But Carlos said it wasn't enough.

1004
01:08:46,390 --> 01:08:49,910
So he wanted to get her away,
so he could extort money from them.

1005
01:08:50,070 --> 01:08:51,030
Is that it?

1006
01:08:51,190 --> 01:08:52,030
Yes.

1007
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:56,350
Carlos put her in touch with them.

1008
01:08:56,870 --> 01:08:58,830
They were unsavory types.

1009
01:08:58,990 --> 01:09:01,350
The girl was scared.

1010
01:09:02,670 --> 01:09:04,710
-This is yours, isn't it?
-Yes.

1011
01:09:05,430 --> 01:09:07,750
Did you give it to her
or did she just take it?

1012
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:09,030
I gave it to her.

1013
01:09:09,870 --> 01:09:12,670
You know, during her last days here,

1014
01:09:13,070 --> 01:09:15,190
she was in a state of total panic.

1015
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:18,870
She couldn't reach Carlos.
She wanted to run away.

1016
01:09:19,190 --> 01:09:20,310
To Amsterdam?

1017
01:09:21,670 --> 01:09:25,790
She wanted a way to end to it all,
to get her freedom back.

1018
01:09:26,390 --> 01:09:27,750
A way? What way?

1019
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:29,510
Abortion.

1020
01:09:29,950 --> 01:09:31,790
I tried to talk her out of it,

1021
01:09:31,950 --> 01:09:33,430
to make her see

1022
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:35,510
the path of love and reason,

1023
01:09:35,950 --> 01:09:36,630
but...

1024
01:09:36,830 --> 01:09:39,790
You couldn't stop yourself.
You slipped her the money.

1025
01:09:40,110 --> 01:09:41,110
And my Bible.

1026
01:09:42,390 --> 01:09:43,950
What else could I do,

1027
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:45,750
but pray for her,

1028
01:09:45,910 --> 01:09:48,350
pray that she'd keep that child?

1029
01:09:51,030 --> 01:09:53,430
But...
Why did you agree to it?

1030
01:09:55,710 --> 01:09:57,950
Why did you agree to hide her
in the nunnery?

1031
01:10:01,390 --> 01:10:03,350
I thought of it as atonement.

1032
01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:09,270
I was atoning for a mistake I made,
30 years ago.

1033
01:10:10,270 --> 01:10:13,190
I was far from thinking
that my life belonged to God.

1034
01:10:15,190 --> 01:10:19,470
I was beautiful, I think,
carefree and unaware.

1035
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:24,870
That was when
I started to spend time with Carlos.

1036
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:28,270
He was already a thug,
but I was very...

1037
01:10:29,150 --> 01:10:30,710
He was beautiful.

1038
01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:51,670
He's dead.

1039
01:12:51,990 --> 01:12:53,150
You killed him.

1040
01:12:53,310 --> 01:12:54,270
You killed him.

1041
01:12:54,430 --> 01:12:55,950
I'm going to report you.

1042
01:12:56,310 --> 01:12:58,710
I'm going to report you.

1043
01:13:03,790 --> 01:13:04,670
No...

1044
01:13:05,070 --> 01:13:05,950
No...

1045
01:13:06,310 --> 01:13:09,590
Carlos threatened to report me,
for murder,

1046
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:12,710
so I jumped on a train, for France.

1047
01:13:13,110 --> 01:13:16,670
As soon as I arrived,
I went into a church

1048
01:13:17,070 --> 01:13:19,870
And I've never left, since.

1049
01:13:20,870 --> 01:13:22,270
Lord!

1050
01:13:22,950 --> 01:13:24,230
Lord!

1051
01:13:24,590 --> 01:13:26,950
Can you ever forgive me?

1052
01:13:51,430 --> 01:13:55,110
We know You, because we know Jesus

1053
01:13:55,350 --> 01:13:58,510
and the Father and Son are one.

1054
01:13:59,350 --> 01:14:01,430
We know through faith,

1055
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:04,590
which is a true marker.

1056
01:14:04,830 --> 01:14:08,510
Later, we shall know You
through a vision.

1057
01:14:09,150 --> 01:14:11,550
Let yourself be filled
by the Holy Spirit.

1058
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:14,350
-Hello Séverine.
-Hello.

1059
01:14:15,110 --> 01:14:16,350
It's chucking it down.

1060
01:14:17,270 --> 01:14:18,510
Isn't he here?

1061
01:14:25,950 --> 01:14:28,070
-Have you seen the priest?
-Not today.

1062
01:14:28,230 --> 01:14:28,990
Ah, OK.

1063
01:14:29,310 --> 01:14:29,990
See you later.

1064
01:14:30,190 --> 01:14:31,790
Bye.

1065
01:14:32,990 --> 01:14:34,350
Thanks be to You,

1066
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:38,350
who ordered the light to shine
amid the darkness

1067
01:14:38,590 --> 01:14:40,430
and to light up our hearts,

1068
01:14:40,630 --> 01:14:44,230
and give us the understanding
that leads us to know

1069
01:14:44,390 --> 01:14:45,990
the face of Jesus Christ,

1070
01:14:46,350 --> 01:14:47,870
the true light.

1071
01:14:48,030 --> 01:14:51,990
Better still, eternal life
is to know you,

1072
01:14:52,190 --> 01:14:54,070
the only true God

1073
01:14:54,270 --> 01:14:57,670
and the one that you sent,
Jesus Christ.

1074
01:14:58,190 --> 01:15:00,710
We know You, because...

1075
01:15:06,950 --> 01:15:08,790
My mind is made up, Sisters.

1076
01:15:10,150 --> 01:15:12,670
I just spoke to our bishop,
on the telephone.

1077
01:15:13,030 --> 01:15:15,510
He's expecting me this evening,
in Strasbourg.

1078
01:15:16,590 --> 01:15:17,230
Mother,

1079
01:15:17,710 --> 01:15:22,230
I'm sure that whatever your sin,
Our Lord will watch over you.

1080
01:15:24,390 --> 01:15:26,590
I humbly ask for forgiveness.

1081
01:15:29,110 --> 01:15:30,270
From all of you.

1082
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:32,150
My sisters,

1083
01:15:33,150 --> 01:15:35,150
I humbly ask your forgiveness.

1084
01:15:36,830 --> 01:15:39,510
-Forgive me.
-But how can you leave us?

1085
01:15:40,150 --> 01:15:41,710
How can you leave us?

1086
01:15:42,030 --> 01:15:44,790
I'm not abandoning you, I promise.

1087
01:15:45,430 --> 01:15:49,630
But the lies that have long
accompanied me in my Christian life

1088
01:15:50,110 --> 01:15:52,630
are finally to be revealed.

1089
01:15:54,510 --> 01:15:56,590
It's my duty now

1090
01:15:56,910 --> 01:15:59,710
to assume them,
within our Holy Church

1091
01:15:59,870 --> 01:16:01,590
and before its representatives.

1092
01:16:03,630 --> 01:16:04,430
My Sisters,

1093
01:16:06,790 --> 01:16:07,870
my Sisters,

1094
01:16:08,670 --> 01:16:10,710
I entrust you to the wisdom

1095
01:16:11,110 --> 01:16:12,790
of Sister Célestine.

1096
01:16:34,070 --> 01:16:36,070
Do you think the couple killed Carlos

1097
01:16:36,230 --> 01:16:38,830
and then tracked Manuela down?

1098
01:16:39,030 --> 01:16:40,830
Carlos, yes, but not Manuela.

1099
01:16:41,030 --> 01:16:44,550
They wouldn't kill a girl
that was carrying their child.

1100
01:16:44,830 --> 01:16:47,430
The world can be distasteful.
We must retain hope.

1101
01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:49,430
That sounds a bit daft.

1102
01:16:49,590 --> 01:16:50,430
Do you think?

1103
01:16:51,590 --> 01:16:52,510
By the way,

1104
01:16:52,710 --> 01:16:55,950
are nuns entitled
to have visitors in their cells?

1105
01:16:56,110 --> 01:16:57,430
Other than other nuns, no.

1106
01:16:57,590 --> 01:16:58,350
Really?

1107
01:16:58,510 --> 01:17:00,310
And can they leave the convent?

1108
01:17:00,470 --> 01:17:02,950
Not without the consent
of the bishop and abbess.

1109
01:17:03,110 --> 01:17:04,590
It's a bit like jail.

1110
01:17:04,790 --> 01:17:06,870
The food's a lot better.

1111
01:17:11,470 --> 01:17:13,710
-Have you had a revelation?
-Can't you see?

1112
01:17:14,590 --> 01:17:17,270
-Is your ride parked nearby?
-It's just there.

1113
01:17:18,190 --> 01:17:20,750
It's as if I could hear a voice,
telling me:

1114
01:17:20,870 --> 01:17:23,590
"That's our link with the exterior."

1115
01:17:24,030 --> 01:17:25,230
Or it's tinnitus.

1116
01:17:25,390 --> 01:17:26,790
Give me a ride. Quick!

1117
01:17:46,110 --> 01:17:48,150
There you go.

1118
01:17:48,310 --> 01:17:50,030
It's just as I said. I was right.

1119
01:17:51,190 --> 01:17:53,510
I thought we'd find you here.

1120
01:17:54,030 --> 01:17:55,150
It's pretty obvious.

1121
01:17:55,670 --> 01:17:57,710
And you were here, at the time.

1122
01:17:57,910 --> 01:18:00,990
I know, I checked.
But that doesn't really matter.

1123
01:18:01,190 --> 01:18:03,390
That's good,
because I've got nothing to say.

1124
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:07,670
But I can tell you something.
You weren't alone on that day.

1125
01:18:07,830 --> 01:18:09,510
You were with one of the nuns.

1126
01:18:09,670 --> 01:18:12,390
You were her taxi.

1127
01:18:12,590 --> 01:18:16,310
You left the nunnery early with her
and dropped her off,

1128
01:18:16,550 --> 01:18:19,950
then you came to do your shopping
and dropped her off in the evening,

1129
01:18:20,110 --> 01:18:22,030
back at the nunnery.
True or false?

1130
01:18:22,630 --> 01:18:23,510
Listen to me,

1131
01:18:23,710 --> 01:18:27,030
they can't leave the nunnery
and I swore an oath.

1132
01:18:27,230 --> 01:18:29,150
Stop trying to fool me.

1133
01:18:29,350 --> 01:18:31,310
-I saw you that night...
-What?

1134
01:18:31,510 --> 01:18:34,230
Yes, you were coming out
of one of the nun's cells.

1135
01:18:34,390 --> 01:18:35,710
Who was it?

1136
01:18:36,190 --> 01:18:39,110
Hey? Who are you so close to?

1137
01:18:43,310 --> 01:18:44,270
Talk, Jean.

1138
01:18:44,750 --> 01:18:46,310
Only the truth is good to tell.

1139
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:58,750
Sister Maryse. It's Sister Maryse.
But it's not what you think.

1140
01:19:00,270 --> 01:19:02,470
She's reconciling me to faith.

1141
01:19:03,670 --> 01:19:04,950
With faith?

1142
01:19:05,310 --> 01:19:06,750
That's some faith.

1143
01:19:07,150 --> 01:19:09,710
And did Maryse
ask you to drop her off in town?

1144
01:19:11,190 --> 01:19:11,990
Yes.

1145
01:19:12,870 --> 01:19:13,830
What did I say?

1146
01:19:17,110 --> 01:19:18,430
How could you do this?

1147
01:19:19,870 --> 01:19:22,030
How could you renounce your vows?

1148
01:19:25,230 --> 01:19:28,150
Don't make this harder
than it already is.

1149
01:19:28,750 --> 01:19:30,670
How can you abandon me?

1150
01:19:31,230 --> 01:19:34,950
That Spanish girl has bewitched you.
She's torn you from me.

1151
01:19:35,230 --> 01:19:37,190
How could you tell her to abort?

1152
01:19:37,310 --> 01:19:38,750
What are you saying?

1153
01:19:38,910 --> 01:19:42,150
I never said any such thing. Never!

1154
01:19:42,350 --> 01:19:46,470
-Abortion is a crime.
-Calm down, Sister Maryse.

1155
01:19:46,590 --> 01:19:47,710
I beg you.

1156
01:19:48,710 --> 01:19:50,670
You're betraying what we are.

1157
01:19:50,910 --> 01:19:53,150
-No.
-How could you

1158
01:19:53,350 --> 01:19:55,590
give her the money from our work?

1159
01:19:57,110 --> 01:19:57,750
I...

1160
01:19:57,910 --> 01:20:01,910
Our Lord's money, for such a sin.

1161
01:20:02,750 --> 01:20:05,470
And you expect me
to stand by and do nothing?

1162
01:20:06,390 --> 01:20:08,270
Only God is love.

1163
01:20:09,110 --> 01:20:10,310
Only God is love.

1164
01:20:25,310 --> 01:20:27,750
I beg you to open this door.

1165
01:20:28,230 --> 01:20:30,990
For the love of God, open this door.

1166
01:20:31,270 --> 01:20:34,310
I won't let you abandon me.

1167
01:20:34,910 --> 01:20:37,190
I beg you to open this door.

1168
01:20:38,030 --> 01:20:39,830
Only God is love.

1169
01:20:39,990 --> 01:20:41,750
Only God is love.

1170
01:20:41,910 --> 01:20:44,430
Open this door, for the love of God!

1171
01:20:45,750 --> 01:20:46,750
It's awful, Father.

1172
01:20:46,950 --> 01:20:50,590
She won't open the door.
She was shouting. It's awful.

1173
01:20:50,790 --> 01:20:54,750
We can't hear a sound.
I'm scared something bad happened.

1174
01:20:54,910 --> 01:20:58,590
-Take your flock to the chapel.
-Come with me, please, Sisters.

1175
01:20:58,790 --> 01:21:01,150
Captain Marleau and our sisters
need us to pray.

1176
01:21:01,310 --> 01:21:03,270
And pray hard.

1177
01:21:07,790 --> 01:21:10,270
Maryse! Can you hear me?
It's Marleau.

1178
01:21:12,310 --> 01:21:15,030
Maryse? I'm going to come in, OK?

1179
01:21:15,550 --> 01:21:16,910
That way, we can talk.

1180
01:21:20,590 --> 01:21:23,270
If you're not just plaster,
it's time to help.

1181
01:21:36,030 --> 01:21:37,190
Stay where you are.

1182
01:21:37,750 --> 01:21:41,350
Don't come any closer, do you hear?
Don't come any closer.

1183
01:21:41,590 --> 01:21:44,030
Maryse, let the Mother Superior
come with me.

1184
01:21:44,230 --> 01:21:46,070
If Mother Louise goes,
I'll kill myself.

1185
01:21:46,670 --> 01:21:49,310
Things can't end like this, Maryse,
you know that.

1186
01:21:50,230 --> 01:21:53,190
Look at your Christ.
Hasn't he suffered enough?

1187
01:21:53,510 --> 01:21:57,150
He suffered for people like you.
You pushed that girl,

1188
01:21:57,310 --> 01:21:57,910
didn't you?

1189
01:22:02,630 --> 01:22:05,030
If she'd listened,
it wouldn't have happened.

1190
01:22:29,790 --> 01:22:34,190
She didn't want to hear God's will.
She was going to abort the baby.

1191
01:22:35,190 --> 01:22:36,470
I know, Maryse, I know.

1192
01:22:36,790 --> 01:22:38,790
I told her that our money
couldn't be used

1193
01:22:39,030 --> 01:22:41,430
for such a sin.
She should heed the Lord's voice.

1194
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:45,630
But she mocked the love
that binds me to Mother Louise.

1195
01:22:45,950 --> 01:22:48,070
Please, Sister Maryse.

1196
01:22:48,310 --> 01:22:49,710
So I lifted her up,

1197
01:22:51,510 --> 01:22:53,710
with a divine strength
guiding my arm.

1198
01:22:57,070 --> 01:22:59,190
I pushed her.
She didn't have time to shout.

1199
01:23:16,350 --> 01:23:17,870
My God, what have I done?

1200
01:23:19,310 --> 01:23:20,590
What have I done?

1201
01:23:21,910 --> 01:23:22,910
Lord, have mercy.

1202
01:23:26,070 --> 01:23:27,230
Have mercy.

1203
01:23:45,190 --> 01:23:46,230
OK, just take it easy.

1204
01:23:46,470 --> 01:23:48,630
We're not cowboys.
She'll come quietly.

1205
01:23:48,910 --> 01:23:50,030
It's not heavy duty.

1206
01:23:52,310 --> 01:23:53,750
It'll be OK. Don't worry.

1207
01:24:05,670 --> 01:24:07,750
Let me come with her, please.

1208
01:24:09,070 --> 01:24:10,150
OK, go ahead.

1209
01:24:10,310 --> 01:24:11,350
Let's go.

1210
01:24:26,910 --> 01:24:29,670
Sisters, let us pray for their souls.

1211
01:24:32,470 --> 01:24:36,790
Deliver me, Lord, from eternal death
on the fearful day of reckoning,

1212
01:24:36,990 --> 01:24:39,230
when You come
to test the world with fire.

1213
01:24:39,430 --> 01:24:42,630
I am in fear and trembling
of the approaching judgment

1214
01:24:42,750 --> 01:24:44,630
and the anger to come.

1215
01:24:59,670 --> 01:25:00,590
May I?

1216
01:25:01,510 --> 01:25:02,670
God be with you.

1217
01:25:03,350 --> 01:25:04,390
Thank you.

1218
01:25:07,310 --> 01:25:08,350
Don't cry.

1219
01:25:26,430 --> 01:25:27,750
SAVERNE RAILWAY STATION

1220
01:25:28,030 --> 01:25:29,910
So, you're leaving the nunnery?

1221
01:25:30,110 --> 01:25:33,470
Yes,
I've failed in my mission.

1222
01:25:33,830 --> 01:25:35,750
An abbess should protect her sisters.

1223
01:25:35,910 --> 01:25:37,590
I didn't see she was suffering

1224
01:25:37,750 --> 01:25:39,190
and losing her mind.

1225
01:25:39,350 --> 01:25:40,750
Yes, maybe.

1226
01:25:40,950 --> 01:25:44,830
But it's the big day now.
You need to face up to the truth.

1227
01:25:45,070 --> 01:25:46,910
-The land of fairies is over now.
-Yes.

1228
01:25:47,110 --> 01:25:49,070
You're strong.
You can do it. You'll see.

1229
01:25:49,230 --> 01:25:50,470
Thanks, Captain.

1230
01:25:50,630 --> 01:25:52,190
It's thanks to you

1231
01:25:52,390 --> 01:25:55,750
that I can appear as I truly am
before the Lord.

1232
01:25:56,510 --> 01:25:59,630
Now I need to honor my appointment
with the archbishop.

1233
01:26:00,270 --> 01:26:02,510
I have to tell him the truth.

1234
01:26:02,710 --> 01:26:05,590
Ah, on that subject,
I have something for you.

1235
01:26:06,470 --> 01:26:08,390
It's a police report.

1236
01:26:09,670 --> 01:26:11,630
-But...
-From the Guardia Civil.

1237
01:26:11,790 --> 01:26:15,550
-Are you arresting me?
-No, I'm not arresting you.

1238
01:26:15,910 --> 01:26:18,230
In 1985, you pushed a man.

1239
01:26:18,670 --> 01:26:20,550
He died, but not because of you.

1240
01:26:21,630 --> 01:26:22,230
Sorry?

1241
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:26,350
Some hikers found his body,
two or three days later.

1242
01:26:26,510 --> 01:26:28,830
His skull had been beaten in,
with a stone.

1243
01:26:29,230 --> 01:26:32,070
I suppose it was Carlos.

1244
01:26:38,510 --> 01:26:40,070
-What?
-What will I do?

1245
01:26:40,830 --> 01:26:43,350
Captain, arrest me, please.

1246
01:26:43,550 --> 01:26:47,390
I've nowhere to go. He'll find me.
I don't want to end up like Manuela.

1247
01:26:47,550 --> 01:26:49,270
I've got good news.

1248
01:26:49,470 --> 01:26:51,470
Carlos is dead.

1249
01:26:51,670 --> 01:26:53,030
-Dead?
-Yes.

1250
01:26:53,390 --> 01:26:55,790
He drowned, with his hands
tied behind his back.

1251
01:26:56,790 --> 01:26:58,190
May he rest in peace.

1252
01:26:58,350 --> 01:27:01,390
Good be praised, Captain.

1253
01:27:03,670 --> 01:27:06,190
-I have to go.
-Go, or you'll miss your train.

1254
01:27:06,950 --> 01:27:10,070
Isabel, how do you say "good luck"
in Spanish?

1255
01:27:10,270 --> 01:27:13,070
-"Buena suerte", Captain.
-Buena suerte.

1256
01:27:13,830 --> 01:27:15,910
It's not a holy relic!

1257
01:27:19,270 --> 01:27:20,910
Thanks, this changes everything!

1258
01:27:22,550 --> 01:27:24,830
¡Hasta la victoria siempre!

1259
01:27:24,990 --> 01:27:26,390
Ciao!

1260
01:27:48,670 --> 01:27:50,630
Problems, Captain?

1261
01:27:51,310 --> 01:27:52,550
-Ah, you're here.
-Yes.

1262
01:27:52,750 --> 01:27:55,470
This thing here won't work.
It's so annoying.

1263
01:27:55,670 --> 01:27:58,190
Machines are like the soul.
They can be capricious.

1264
01:27:58,390 --> 01:28:01,910
-Shall I give you a ride?
-Yes, but I wanted to ask something.

1265
01:28:02,430 --> 01:28:04,190
What does having faith change?

1266
01:28:04,350 --> 01:28:05,910
Nothing and everything.

1267
01:28:06,110 --> 01:28:09,070
If that's all, you can shut your gob,
as my grandmother said.

1268
01:28:09,230 --> 01:28:10,790
Faith won't stop you limping,

1269
01:28:10,990 --> 01:28:14,670
but someone that loves you
will be at the end of the road.

1270
01:28:16,670 --> 01:28:18,510
Shall we play some pinball, instead?

1271
01:28:18,670 --> 01:28:19,390
Let's go.

1272
01:28:19,550 --> 01:28:21,070
Let's go.

1273
01:28:21,230 --> 01:28:23,830
Let's go! See you later, hot wheels.

1274
01:28:28,510 --> 01:28:31,550
Jesus is coming back.
Jesus is coming back.

1275
01:28:31,710 --> 01:28:34,510
Jesus is coming back to your people.

1276
01:28:34,670 --> 01:28:38,230
From upon your cross on high,
show us the way,

1277
01:28:38,390 --> 01:28:41,070
You, that know it so well.

1278
01:28:41,230 --> 01:28:44,070
Jesus says bear left!
