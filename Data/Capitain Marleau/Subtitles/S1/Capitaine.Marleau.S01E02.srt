00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,890
CAPTAIN MARLEAU

2
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:00,730
THE HOUSE OF THE MEYER SISTERS

3
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,090
You changed your mind?

4
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:35,210
I didn't change my mind.

5
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,330
I just think you're rushing things
a little.

6
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:41,530
We're not rushing.

7
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,810
Now is simply the best time to sell.

8
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:45,450
Why?

9
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,210
Business has never been better.

10
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,770
Which means we have
negotiating power.

11
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:54,170
The buyer paid more than
we're asking.

12
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,650
We're making a profit.

13
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,730
I'm just not like you,

14
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,930
thinking like a cash register.

15
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,370
This is my whole life.

16
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:04,890
We know that, dad.

17
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,450
That's not what he meant.

18
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,610
I see you started without me.

19
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,530
You're an hour late.

20
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:20,370
Guess I'm not in a hurry
to squander dad's inheritance.

21
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,090
You've got to be kidding:

22
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,170
it's only 1 p.m. and she's drunk.

23
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,050
No rest for the weary.

24
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,090
I'll do it, mother.

25
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,450
I do the work around here, me.

26
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,050
I always have.

27
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,450
I didn't do it on purpose.

28
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:41,930
You think she heard?

29
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:45,090
Bénédicte Hartmann?
She's been gone over 40 years.

30
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,770
Really? Why didn't anyone tell me?

31
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,250
That's why he's buying the brewery.

32
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:53,930
I don't like that guy.

33
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,810
-Welcome to Meyer's.
-Thank you.

34
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:25,130
-Did you have a good trip?
-Yes, it's the big day!

35
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:28,690
Please, come in.

36
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:32,210
This is my father, Mr Franz Meyer.

37
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,250
Dimitri Nobécourt.

38
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,530
-We've met before.
-I don't think so.

39
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,370
But... your face is familiar.

40
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:48,690
Your eyes.

41
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:50,610
Yes...

42
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,330
Where are you from?

43
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,610
Lower Normandy.

44
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,090
Mr Leblanc is late,

45
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:04,170
but you can try
our new line while we wait.

46
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,250
With pleasure.

47
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:16,090
The grain is brought to
an enormous oven, a roaster.

48
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,810
Roasting determines
the color of the malt.

49
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,690
Here are a few batches.

50
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,330
The grain is heated,

51
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,810
and the longer it roasts,
the darker the beer will be.

52
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,530
I'll show you the malt house.

53
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,690
On the sale agreement,

54
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:36,650
it says you were born in Strasbourg.

55
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,130
I never lived there.

56
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,970
My parents moved when I was young.

57
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,570
I'm returning to my roots.

58
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,690
We're headed to the malt floor.

59
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,850
That's where we keep the grain.

60
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,490
The humidity level needs to be high,

61
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:05,370
and the temperature
between 12 and 15 Celsius.

62
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:29,290
I think the sale is compromised,
young man.

63
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,490
-What's wrong?
-Norbert Marmande is dead!

64
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,490
The police are coming.

65
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,610
And the sale?

66
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,690
Hello, I'm Captain Marleau.

67
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:13,210
-Did you know him?
-Of course, Marmande.

68
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,730
He was the brewery's accountant.

69
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,250
And you are?

70
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,810
Dimitri Nobécourt, the future buyer.

71
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:25,690
I was to meet with Mr Marmande
to sign some papers.

72
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:29,450
Damn, that's a shame.
This is going to delay the sale.

73
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:30,930
Goodbye.

74
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,730
You'll stay around for
the police, right?

75
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,130
Here.

76
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,450
Did someone have it in
for your accountant?

77
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,850
-You don't believe it was suicide?
-I don't believe anything.

78
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:36,450
I'm an atheist.
Did he have any enemies?

79
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,970
Besides himself, I don't think so.

80
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:42,330
His son lives in London.

81
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:46,010
And his wife left him
for the town plumber.

82
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,370
How long ago?

83
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,130
Four years, I think.

84
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,490
That's long enough
to get over being cheated on.

85
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:57,570
Anything else that
might have pushed him to suicide?

86
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:04,010
You know why people say
I'm ugly as sin?

87
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,090
Excuse me?

88
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,850
Because it's true!

89
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:11,410
I latch on, just like this.

90
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,570
Like this!

91
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,010
You bet!

92
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,890
Good luck getting rid of me.

93
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,650
I suggest you tell me
everything you know.

94
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:23,770
I won't let you go until you do.
I'm listening.

95
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:28,050
I think he might have been
a little in love with my daughter.

96
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,130
Clara never paid attention.

97
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,130
It might seem backward to you,

98
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,570
but Clara's crazy about her husband.

99
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,050
It's the truth.

100
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:44,170
Alright, then.

101
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:47,770
I'd like to look at the books,
your accounts.

102
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,690
They might be more... talkative.

103
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,650
You'll be wasting your time.

104
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,570
They've never been better!

105
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:58,970
I left my daughter
a small family business,

106
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,570
and she made it an
international success.

107
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,410
Our beer is even sold in
Japan and China now.

108
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:09,690
The crisis clearly hasn't
affected you.

109
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,770
-That being said.
-Yes?

110
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:16,730
Your accountant's corpse
looked less enthusiastic than you.

111
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,290
Sorry.

112
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,050
Just a little less.

113
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:57,850
Hello.

114
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:01,970
You should have a reservation for
Dimitri Nobécourt.

115
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:05,250
-Number 220, second floor, sir.
-Thank you.

116
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,810
Please send up
a bottle of your best wine.

117
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:22,610
Come in.

118
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,690
There's a message for you, sir.

119
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:29,650
Thank you.

120
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:16,010
Come on,
this isn't the Cannes film festival.

121
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,330
Don't push it.

122
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,290
How's it going?

123
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,330
Oscar Langevin. Head of Forensics,
fingerprint expert.

124
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,010
Marleau, Captain. Period.

125
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,690
Just been transferred.
I'm the new guy.

126
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:35,250
We're going to get along.
I like little redheads.

127
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:36,530
If you say so.

128
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,970
Who's the customer?

129
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:41,770
Franz Meyer, 75. His daughter
reported his death this morning.

130
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:44,890
OK, then, go ahead. Show the captain.

131
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:46,810
Here he is.

132
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:50,010
Hematoma on the left parietal.

133
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:53,330
You said it.
What time do you think it happened?

134
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:55,450
We'll know more after
the larvae analysis,

135
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,410
but I'd say around midnight.

136
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,530
Are those bite marks from
his attacker?

137
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:02,770
No, rodents.

138
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:06,610
Judging from the shape,
I'd say, microti agrestes.

139
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:09,010
I quit Latin in the seventh grade.

140
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:11,810
You're going to have
to use normal words, okay?

141
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:14,850
I think
they're the work of agrestic voles.

142
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:18,530
Aggressive moles that bite?

143
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:21,890
Never mind.
Did you find any organic material?

144
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:24,890
No, his attacker approached from
behind.

145
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:26,730
There's a print. Might be his.

146
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,690
What about footprints? Tire tracks?

147
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:33,610
No tire tracks. The only thing
we have to go on is the soil.

148
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,810
Which is extremely difficult.

149
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:38,770
You know how geologically varied
the terrain is.

150
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,810
Of course I do.

151
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,050
We'll study samples,

152
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:46,330
we'll find sandy loam,

153
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,730
Pliocene and quaternary sands,

154
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,970
sediment from the Rhine,

155
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:54,610
and peat formations,
since we're at the bottom of a hill.

156
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:58,570
Maybe even a few clay pockets.
But!

157
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:04,690
I also found this.

158
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,890
There's always a "but."

159
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:08,410
What is it?

160
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,970
I think this little sample
is going to tell us a lot.

161
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:13,290
I'll tell you more in the lab.

162
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:27,450
Mrs Meyer? Captain Marleau.

163
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:30,970
We found your husband.
I'm sorry, ma'am.

164
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,810
My husband? Have you seen him?

165
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,290
I've been waiting for him for
two hours.

166
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:38,690
He's probably still at the brewery.
I have to go,

167
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,770
or the boss will complain.

168
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:43,290
She's not very easy-going, you know.

169
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:46,010
Mrs Meyer, your husband is dead.

170
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:47,930
I have to go.

171
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:51,090
Mother isn't all there anymore.

172
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,610
What happened?

173
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:55,170
He received a blow to the head.

174
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:56,530
Franz?

175
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,090
Are you there?

176
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,530
Smells like money.

177
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,010
Looks like the set of a
Hitchcock film.

178
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,610
Tell me about your father.

179
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,490
My parents were...

180
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:54,050
They met 50 years ago.
They worked here.

181
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:56,410
Dad was a brewer, mom was a waitress.

182
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:58,010
Bitch!

183
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:02,170
She means her old boss,
Bénédicte Hartmann.

184
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,330
She owes her though,

185
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,170
it was her farm.

186
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:08,330
She was the boss, and
she passed the business on to them?

187
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,810
No, one day she moved away.

188
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:13,250
My dad bought it from her aunt.

189
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:17,210
Seems like your dad's a lucky man.

190
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,770
When they retired,
we divided the business in thirds.

191
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:24,450
Pétra harvests the barley,

192
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,890
I manage the malt house
and Clara, the brewery.

193
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:28,770
Have you met my daughter?

194
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:32,210
I haven't had the honor, ma'am.

195
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:34,690
That girl can turn lead into gold.

196
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,890
It's true. My sister completely
overhauled the brand.

197
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,570
She made it younger,
"Pop" as she says.

198
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:45,570
People who succeed at
everything in life are aggravating.

199
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,490
Pisses me off, too.

200
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,930
Augustine doesn't care about success.

201
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,490
She's not interested.

202
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:54,650
She already has a foot in heaven,
you know.

203
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:55,650
Mother...

204
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,490
It's true, dear.

205
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,410
You're half angel already.

206
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:02,490
And your third daughter,
is she an angel, too?

207
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:07,330
Pétra, now that one,

208
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:10,490
She couldn't care less about success.

209
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:12,850
She'd dance on our graves.

210
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:16,410
It's "spit on your graves,"
according to Boris Vian,

211
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,010
it's more effective.

212
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:20,930
So, besides your daughter,

213
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:24,210
would anyone else like to dance
or spit on your husband's grave

214
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,170
and/or that of his accountant?

215
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,490
Yes, this boy here,

216
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,930
from who knows where,
for who knows what.

217
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:34,450
He's a real heartbreaker I bet,

218
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,170
with those beautiful eyes.

219
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:38,890
Go ahead.

220
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,970
Mr Nobécourt.
He signed a sale agreement.

221
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,650
He arrived yesterday
to check the accounts.

222
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:47,210
-With Marmande?
-Yes.

223
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:49,410
Isn't Marmande a tomato variety?

224
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,170
The accounts are good?

225
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:54,210
He wasn't trying
to hide a little something?

226
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:57,050
No, quite the opposite.
You don't think that...?

227
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:00,330
Me, I don't believe anything.
I show up and I wait.

228
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,450
And people are so twisted,

229
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:05,930
they answer questions
I haven't even asked.

230
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:07,770
Totally out of it.

231
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:30,930
Hello?

232
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:35,330
Captain Marleau, police department.

233
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:39,010
Got a lot of business lately?

234
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:41,330
Don't get me started, it's dead.

235
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,930
Dead as a doornail.

236
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:46,890
So you could easily say
who's been in and out of the hotel?

237
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,050
You can always ask.

238
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:51,770
A guy checked in yesterday,
Dimitri Nobécourt.

239
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:54,770
-Did he go out last night?
-Around 11 p.m.

240
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:57,770
Yeah, around 11 p.m. OK.

241
00:19:58,770 --> 00:19:59,930
That's good.

242
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:05,930
Anything else that would be... ?

243
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,050
He received a message at 6 p.m.

244
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:10,730
-Do you know from whom?
-Franz.

245
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,850
-Franz who?
-Franz Meyer.

246
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:15,490
We all know each other around here.

247
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:17,730
Why do you ask?

248
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:20,370
No reason. I like juicy tidbits.

249
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:22,930
No meat, though, I'm vegetarian.

250
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:26,730
Is Mr Nobécourt in his room?

251
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,610
No, he just went out.

252
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:31,050
I'll be on my way then.

253
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,610
-Thanks.
-Sure.

254
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,650
Have a good one.

255
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,370
-Hello, Captain.
-Hi.

256
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:57,610
-Walk with me a bit?
-Careful.

257
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:00,650
With me,
taking a walk is already first base.

258
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:02,930
-We'll just start with walking.
-OK.

259
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:04,810
Beautiful day.

260
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,650
This is a busy place.

261
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:08,650
What do you mean?

262
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:12,570
Meyer's brewery:
the accountant killed himself.

263
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,090
Well, assuming he did.

264
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,770
Then Meyer himself gets killed
just after.

265
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:20,730
Weird, isn't it?
You think they're related?

266
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:23,650
You're the cop. And I just got here.

267
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:29,330
Why do you want to settle down
in the area anyway?

268
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:32,090
-Who said I'm settling down?
-I don't know.

269
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:35,370
-Are you from around here?
-No.

270
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:39,650
I've done well in life,
mainly to please my mother.

271
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:42,050
I wanted a change after she died.

272
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:44,610
I saw the ad and I figured, why not?

273
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:49,930
Do you have a connection
to the Meyer family?

274
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:51,810
Why would I?

275
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:54,930
I only met Clara just two months ago.

276
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,810
Why this brewery in particular?

277
00:21:58,930 --> 00:21:59,930
What's it got?

278
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,650
I'm a business man,
and it's a good business.

279
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:05,370
A good business.

280
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:08,650
That's strange.
If it's a good business...

281
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,650
Why are they selling?

282
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:12,650
You should ask them that.

283
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,370
Anyway, what were you doing
last night?

284
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:18,530
My alibi?

285
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:22,890
I got to my hotel, unpacked my things
and went for a walk.

286
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,450
-Alone?
-Yes.

287
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,090
Walking?

288
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:30,650
That's weird.
Your shoes are squeaky clean.

289
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:34,650
My mother said a man should have
clean hands and polished shoes.

290
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:36,250
I try to stick to that.

291
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,810
My grandmother said don't be deceived
by appearances.

292
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:42,250
I have a little collection.

293
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:47,170
I need your DNA to add to it.

294
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:49,810
Open wide. There.

295
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,530
-Thank you.
-See you.

296
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:55,970
I'm not done.

297
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,890
Your prints.

298
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:12,530
Comrade.

299
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:14,810
Stay put, it's fine.

300
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,250
Oscar?

301
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:41,330
News?

302
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:45,650
Norbert Marmande, 44, suicide.

303
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,930
Suicide. You're definitely sure?

304
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:50,770
Without a doubt. Point blank range.

305
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,530
Traces of gunpowder on hand.

306
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:55,570
Alrighty.
And our other customer, Franz Meyer?

307
00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:00,250
Homicide, confirmed. Time of death,
between 10:30 and 11:30 p.m.

308
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:02,410
The soil accelerated decomposition.

309
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:08,930
Is that yours?

310
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:11,370
You're not as stuck-up as you look.

311
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:15,210
What about the prints?

312
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:17,610
The prints.

313
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:21,370
They're not the victim's.

314
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,130
But they aren't registered.

315
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:27,370
We need to get prints from
the whole family and compare.

316
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:30,210
Add this one to your list
while you're at it.

317
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:33,970
It's Nobécourt's DNA.
The guy who bought the brewery.

318
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:37,050
The day the accountant
committed suicide.

319
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,490
You said it, pal.

320
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:43,010
What about the soil?

321
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:45,250
We tested the samples.

322
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:48,370
We found plant litter,

323
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,650
which is normal in a
pine grove where the soil is acidic,

324
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:53,850
poor in nitrogen and other minerals.

325
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:56,090
But that's not all.

326
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,650
We also found

327
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:03,370
sandy sediments, like this one,

328
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:05,370
even,

329
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:10,090
coarse, like this one,

330
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:15,170
a result of water falling from
the sandstone Vosges mountains.

331
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:19,050
Did you take cinema as an elective
at the police academy?

332
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:21,330
Cause the suspense is killing me.

333
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:25,170
Well, actually, we also found:

334
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:28,210
pollen!

335
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,370
That's the big reveal?

336
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:31,690
You don't get it.

337
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:34,810
It's Calluna Vulgaris pollen.

338
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:37,050
Also known as heather.

339
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:41,010
Ergo, the murderer
was covered in pollen.

340
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:43,530
Ergo, he was in a place

341
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:47,330
where pink heather is grown.

342
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:50,210
-Bring anything to mind?
-Of course!

343
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,610
I'm not as stupid as I look.

344
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,370
Could've fooled me.

345
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:27,530
Beautiful flowers. No thorns.

346
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:31,370
Daddy loved heather.

347
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:34,810
Apparently you were completely
against selling the brewery,

348
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,050
is that true?

349
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,650
This is my childhood.

350
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:44,090
Places have souls,
and mine is not for sale.

351
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:04,250
-Hi, Pétra.
-How are you?

352
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:06,450
-Fine, you?
-Good.

353
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:14,250
We've just learned of Franz Meyer's
murder in the Haguenau woods.

354
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:18,370
The Alsatian was well-known
in the region for his Benedict beers.

355
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:21,250
Up next, the weather.

356
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:19,410
Plus that makes... how much?

357
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:21,490
Times three...

358
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:26,690
This stupid thing doesn't work.

359
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:29,690
How much? With Guy.

360
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:33,330
It's not that. Two mixed aperitifs.

361
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:35,050
Times three.

362
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:39,330
Holy mother, I can't
remember anything. Come on!

363
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:44,930
Where's his number?

364
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,210
Oscar?

365
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:55,530
Yeah, it's Marleau.

366
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:58,650
Do you know anything about
accounting?

367
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:00,650
Can you give me a hand?

368
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:02,930
It's... wait.

369
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:06,130
It's 3:10 a.m. why?

370
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:07,970
No, I'm not drunk.

371
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:13,490
What's that supposed to mean?

372
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:15,130
I have a life, too!

373
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,130
Can you help us?

374
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,410
So you can criticize?

375
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,410
"Not like that."

376
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:30,130
"Remove the seeds."
Nothing's ever right.

377
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:32,130
Because you go too fast.

378
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:35,410
You think people care
if there are seeds?

379
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:37,410
Forget it, then!

380
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:38,370
Cut it out.

381
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:40,330
You should be ashamed.

382
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:43,050
You're right.

383
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:44,690
I'm sorry.

384
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:47,810
It's just...

385
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,770
To think dad died alone...

386
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:57,330
I hope they find who did this.

387
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,530
He won't be long now.

388
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:13,290
Rudolphe? I know, he's late.

389
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:15,690
No, Franz.

390
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:19,410
What's wrong?

391
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:23,250
Why do you all look so sad?

392
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:26,770
What happened?

393
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:29,970
My little girls.

394
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:22,650
-Where's dad?
-He'll be here soon.

395
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:39,090
...allows all his children

396
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:42,690
to leave this earth in peace.

397
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:45,730
You, Christ our God,

398
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:49,290
king for eternity and beyond,

399
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:53,450
and who, in his mercy, gives us

400
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:55,290
more than we ask.

401
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:25,130
-Where were you?
-Parking the car.

402
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:27,170
-We've been waiting.
-Where are the kids?

403
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:29,850
Here, of course.
You could've made an effort.

404
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:31,810
A minimum.

405
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:31,170
My condolences. Nice ceremony.
There were a lot of people.

406
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:35,530
I was talking to your sister,
Augustine,

407
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:39,170
and she said
your father acted strange

408
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:42,250
the first time he saw Mr Nobécourt.
Is that true?

409
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:43,810
Yes, it is.

410
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:46,810
He seemed to recognize him,
but he'd never met him.

411
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:50,130
I was the one who'd been
in contact with Dimitri.

412
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:53,130
How did Dimitri react?

413
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:55,450
He seemed unsettled, too.

414
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:56,530
Ah, okay...

415
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:58,730
And you, sir,

416
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:03,170
in your opinion,
why did the accountant kill himself?

417
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:04,850
That's no secret.

418
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:07,530
He was madly in love with Clara.

419
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:10,410
The sale must have freaked him out.

420
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:11,890
He'd never see her again.

421
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:13,450
Is that true?

422
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:15,050
Maybe, I don't know.

423
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:16,770
OK.

424
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:19,610
I'll let you be now.

425
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:22,610
Wait, I wanted to ask you something.

426
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:26,890
Why does Mr Nobécourt want to offer
so much for the brewery?

427
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:28,050
Money!

428
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:30,130
What else?

429
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:34,970
Oh, right, money.
This brewery's worth a lot of money.

430
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:39,970
So why do you want to get rid of it,
if it's worth so much?

431
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:42,170
We've done all we can here.

432
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:45,290
I wanted to take on a new challenge.

433
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:47,450
Maybe corporate coaching.

434
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:49,610
-Right, coaching.
-Yeah.

435
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:55,010
I think beer is better, personally,
but coaching...

436
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:57,330
We wanted to do something different.

437
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:00,970
Don't try to justify yourself,
only liars do that.

438
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,690
I don't mean you.

439
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:05,690
See you. Get home safe.

440
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:40,450
Here.

441
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:43,730
This'll do you good.

442
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:48,610
Did you know Bénédicte Hartmann?

443
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:53,450
Of course I know her, she's my boss.

444
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:56,610
-What about her?
-Tell me about her.

445
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:58,890
A bitch.

446
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:03,450
One day,
she saw Franz and I by the lake.

447
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:07,450
How that man got under my skin.

448
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:11,490
She went into one of her rages
when she saw us.

449
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:16,170
-Why do you ask?
-No reason.

450
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:19,770
What happened to her?

451
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:22,410
She left with a man.

452
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:24,610
A customer. Just like that.

453
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:26,770
Left the land and brewery behind.

454
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:28,570
An unbearable woman.

455
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:29,850
Children?

456
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:33,410
A little girl, I think.

457
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:35,050
She took her.

458
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:36,770
The father?

459
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:39,450
You don't get it, young man.

460
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:42,850
With her, it's always
when she wants, where she wants.

461
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:46,570
She says men are
good-for-nothing vultures,

462
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:50,130
good at drinking beer,
but never at making it.

463
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:51,570
Get it?

464
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:55,170
Do you know
where she and her daughter went?

465
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:56,370
No idea.

466
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:59,010
She wasn't the type to leave a note.

467
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,490
Franz loved this brewery so much.

468
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:04,770
I can't imagine the tanks empty.

469
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:08,450
The oven unlit, the bar silent.

470
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:12,170
That's all that's left.

471
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:32,170
My parents came up with the
Benedict line.

472
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:36,290
Light, bitter, amber ales.
In honor of the former owner.

473
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:39,730
The one your mother called a "bitch"?

474
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:41,930
That's funny.

475
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:46,650
You do know fudging the books
can get you into big trouble?

476
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:48,570
It can cost you big.

477
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:51,610
We don't just go for the poor,
we get the rich, too.

478
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:56,290
Naughty bosses,
for example, if you get my drift.

479
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:59,730
We can steal
the shirt off your back, too.

480
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:02,170
It's my little hobby. I love it.

481
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:04,610
Here.

482
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:15,730
We're going to stop talking
a load of tripe, okay?

483
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:20,050
Why did your accountant
commit suicide?

484
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:23,890
Because he'd been faking your books
for you, for two years.

485
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:26,530
You were near bankruptcy, that's why.

486
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:28,730
His career was over.

487
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:36,730
Sure is good.

488
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:40,090
I love the first sip,
it's always the best.

489
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:44,090
The second is never quite the same.

490
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:48,050
Like signs of wealth. Smells good,
but isn't really my thing.

491
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:51,090
What do you think?

492
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,050
-Do you have siblings?
-No.

493
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:58,810
My parents plopped me out,
then got a dog three years later.

494
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:03,010
You know what it's like
being the favorite.

495
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:04,810
No, they preferred the dog.

496
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:09,810
I was my father's favorite daughter.

497
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:12,610
The nicest, the most well-behaved.

498
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:16,490
Pétra calls me "Miss Perfect."

499
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:19,330
Coming from her,
it's not a compliment.

500
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:21,250
I was top of the class,

501
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:25,530
so when Augustine turned to religion,
and Pétra to men,

502
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:28,610
I focused on my studies.

503
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:30,490
Business school, an MBA.

504
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:32,930
My father believed in me.

505
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:35,370
And you messed up royally.

506
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:37,450
Contrary to daddy's hopes.

507
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:42,050
Inventory, suppliers, clients...
I didn't know how to manage it.

508
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:46,170
Things don't look great
in your marriage, either.

509
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:47,890
Looks like heartbreak hotel.

510
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:52,770
Rudolphe has started looking around.

511
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:56,810
I love my husband.

512
00:40:58,010 --> 00:40:59,370
He likes big cars,

513
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:02,690
and I try to please him,
to keep him happy.

514
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:04,250
By faking the books?

515
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:07,970
Smart move! Does your husband know?

516
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,450
Not at all.

517
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:13,450
Dimitri's buying a lemon.

518
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:16,330
His golden goose is a pile of shit.

519
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:18,530
Not at all. When Dimitri called,

520
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:20,330
I didn't want him
to get the wrong idea.

521
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:22,530
I told the truth.

522
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:25,730
I asked him not to say anything.

523
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:29,370
What do you mean?
He knew about everything?

524
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:30,370
Yes.

525
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:34,250
Why did he buy this,

526
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:37,250
this business for that price?
It's odd.

527
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:39,050
Mother.

528
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:42,170
Mother?

529
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:47,330
Mother?

530
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:58,610
Clara?

531
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:00,810
Mother's missing.

532
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:02,530
Shit, did you tell Pétra?

533
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:04,330
She's checking the hop field.

534
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:06,090
I'll check the woods.

535
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,530
-You go into town.
-Alright.

536
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:47,690
Franz?

537
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:50,130
Franz?

538
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:55,370
Franz?

539
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:57,410
It's me, Mrs Meyer.

540
00:42:57,610 --> 00:42:59,090
Franz. You're late.

541
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:00,210
Mrs Meyer?

542
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:02,770
What are you doing here?

543
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:05,490
I'm meeting my Franz.

544
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:09,050
Are you crazy?

545
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:11,650
Don't touch me! You'll regret it.

546
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:13,170
You'll regret it!

547
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:15,130
Your girls are worried sick.

548
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:16,850
I'm taking you home.

549
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:19,370
-My girls.
-Yes.

550
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:20,850
My girls?

551
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:23,850
-Oh yes, my girls. Are they okay?
-Yes, they're fine.

552
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:27,770
I couldn't bear anything
to happen to them.

553
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:29,570
Nothing's going to happen, okay?

554
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:32,650
I'm going to take you home, okay?

555
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:36,090
There you are.

556
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:45,850
I already told you.

557
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:48,490
I don't know. I'll call you back.

558
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:53,050
Watch the step.

559
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:56,770
Mother, mother.

560
00:43:56,890 --> 00:43:59,450
You're hurting me!

561
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:01,690
-Where was she?
-Down there.

562
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:04,130
Near the lake.

563
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:05,850
Thanks for bringing her home.

564
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:08,650
Home? This is my home.

565
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:12,010
It's not hers, not yours. It's mine!

566
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:16,930
My Clara!

567
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:20,090
Why don't we go inside
where it's warm?

568
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:21,250
Yes.

569
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:22,810
Please excuse her.

570
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:27,090
Wait a minute. We need to talk.

571
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:31,690
Were you aware the brewery
is worthless?

572
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:34,850
You've heard wrong.
Business is great.

573
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:37,610
Business is great? It's awful.

574
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:41,770
Before Dimitri showed up,
it was headed for receivership.

575
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:43,690
Clara didn't tell us.

576
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:45,530
Poor kitten, I understand.

577
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:51,010
It's true. Maybe she didn't want
to spoil her image,

578
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:52,970
as the perfect daughter.

579
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:54,970
That's why I was wondering:

580
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:59,090
Why does Dimitri
want to buy a failing business?

581
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:01,250
And at that price! Any ideas?

582
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:03,970
I don't know and I don't care.

583
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:06,490
That's nice. Thanks for your help.

584
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:09,090
Dammit.

585
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:53,370
NO MATCH FOUND

586
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:47,130
Hello, Father.

587
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:49,530
My son.

588
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:53,890
Bénédicte Hartmann?

589
00:46:55,610 --> 00:46:56,610
Did you know her?

590
00:46:57,610 --> 00:46:59,690
I can't help you much.

591
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:02,770
She didn't come to church often.

592
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:06,170
Did she have children?

593
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:08,410
Yes, I remember.

594
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:10,570
A little boy.

595
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:13,530
A little boy?

596
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:17,330
What happened to him?

597
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:18,570
Poor child.

598
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:22,210
His mother left him
at the church one night.

599
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:27,770
The Hartmanns didn't want
to raise the child,

600
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:30,610
so social services took him.

601
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:34,610
That's it?

602
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:38,130
She left nothing else?

603
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:40,410
Nothing.

604
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:43,010
In your opinion,

605
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:46,490
did Katel and Augustine Meyer know?

606
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:48,890
I went to see Katel.

607
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:52,530
Augustine was the boy's nanny.

608
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:55,450
She looked after him,
along with Clara.

609
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:01,050
What was his name?

610
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:03,770
Mathis Hartmann.

611
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:39,850
Come in!

612
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:42,530
-I've been waiting.
-I'm here.

613
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:45,450
You were right
about the print on the body.

614
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:48,450
It's Dimitri Nobécourt's.

615
00:48:50,090 --> 00:48:54,330
I'm not sure I'm happy about being
right, it's a little strange.

616
00:48:54,530 --> 00:48:57,490
The guy drops everything,
heads to a little town

617
00:48:57,650 --> 00:48:58,970
he's never been to.

618
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:01,850
Meets a family he doesn't know.

619
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:04,850
The same night, there's a murder.

620
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:06,410
It doesn't make sense.

621
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:10,690
Then again, his print is on the body.

622
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:13,050
Makes sense to me.

623
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:15,810
That's your little nerd brain
talking.

624
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:18,090
You're not thinking creatively.

625
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:11,010
What can I get you?

626
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:14,450
-You know how to talk to women.
-Depends.

627
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:16,330
-So?
-Vodka.

628
00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:18,250
Bartender, two vodkas, please.

629
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:22,730
I needed to take my mind off things.

630
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:25,450
I'll keep the bottle.

631
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:35,770
To dad.

632
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:41,530
What do you do?

633
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:43,210
Business. And you?

634
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:46,890
Not much.
A farmer does most of the work.

635
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:49,810
I watch and wait for better.

636
00:50:49,970 --> 00:50:52,610
-Better how?
-I'd have liked to open a bar.

637
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:56,330
I'd put in a patio.
A place for people to gather.

638
00:50:56,490 --> 00:50:57,130
Why don't you?

639
00:50:58,130 --> 00:50:59,610
My sisters and I
can't stand each other.

640
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:01,450
I don't really have a say.

641
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:07,690
Doesn't matter now, you've bought it.

642
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:10,490
I'll need an associate
for the brewery.

643
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:11,730
Think about it.

644
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:15,890
You don't get it, do you?

645
00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:19,050
Everyone plays a role in my family.

646
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:22,090
I'm the ugly duckling.

647
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:24,970
What if I prefer ugly ducklings?

648
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:31,170
Business, not pleasure.

649
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:34,810
That imbecile, Franz,
gave in to that... bitch's charms.

650
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:39,650
She put on airs, but she was
as common as they come.

651
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:43,050
They met
in the malt house... at night.

652
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:45,770
Sometimes in the afternoon.

653
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:50,050
That's why I killed her there.

654
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:06,490
Look who it is again.
What are you doing here?

655
00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:09,210
Visiting your mother.

656
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:12,050
To ask for my hand?

657
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:14,370
Not exactly.

658
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:29,890
Leave me alone.

659
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:33,410
Hello?

660
00:53:34,930 --> 00:53:35,730
What?

661
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:38,170
I'll be there right away!

662
00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:48,730
What happened?

663
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:50,570
I heard mother screaming.

664
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:52,090
She was crying.

665
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:55,490
I heard a scream,
then something falling. Then nothing.

666
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:57,850
Did you see her attacker?

667
00:53:58,010 --> 00:54:01,290
No, but I recognized his voice.
Dimitri Nobécourt.

668
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:02,410
I figured.

669
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:05,890
I knew it. Let's cordon off the area
and call forensics.

670
00:54:06,050 --> 00:54:07,810
Don't walk all over the place.

671
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:10,450
It might just be a
perfect crime scene,

672
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:12,690
then again maybe not, who knows.

673
00:54:21,210 --> 00:54:22,370
Hey.

674
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:26,770
What's up, Q-tips?

675
00:54:28,330 --> 00:54:30,530
-Captain.
-I didn't recognize you.

676
00:54:39,130 --> 00:54:41,930
What are you doing? Go on.

677
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:43,610
There's work down there.

678
00:54:44,170 --> 00:54:45,850
We're not paid to stand around.

679
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:48,290
That's too much.

680
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:57,210
Hey, it's the police!

681
00:54:59,850 --> 00:55:01,210
I'm coming.

682
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:03,210
I didn't wake you, did I?

683
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:05,570
I'll see the sunrise for once.

684
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:07,490
-All-nighter.
-No more than usual.

685
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:10,930
-Magical night.
-No more than usual.

686
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:14,770
-Busy night then?
-Sorry.

687
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:18,290
You're a big liar.
Nobécourt doesn't count?

688
00:55:18,450 --> 00:55:19,730
-You're spying on me?
-No.

689
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:22,330
Police don't spy, we investigate.

690
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:25,290
You're lucky, I'm not twisted.

691
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:27,370
Because... go on, please.

692
00:55:27,610 --> 00:55:30,530
You know what someone
twisted would think?

693
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:34,570
He'd say, those two are lovers,
they knocked off the old man.

694
00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:36,650
What do you think?

695
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:40,250
But why would I want to kill my dad?
My mother, maybe.

696
00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:42,490
Speaking of your mother.

697
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:44,770
Come with me,
there's a little problem.

698
00:55:48,850 --> 00:55:49,890
This way.

699
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:53,530
Thank you.

700
00:55:54,450 --> 00:55:55,650
Oscar Langevin.

701
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:58,530
-Pétra Meyer.
-Miss.

702
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:01,330
So, what do you think happened?

703
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:05,730
Well, there's broken glass over here.
Signs of a struggle.

704
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:09,210
Blood's been wiped up,
but there are spatters here.

705
00:56:10,370 --> 00:56:12,490
There.

706
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:15,490
I want to know exactly how
it happened.

707
00:56:15,650 --> 00:56:17,050
Go on, take me.

708
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:20,610
-I'm sorry?
-Take me! That's an order.

709
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:22,810
It's a reconstruction, not...

710
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:27,370
I'll be her, you be him, okay?
I run away, okay? I'm running!

711
00:56:28,570 --> 00:56:29,490
She couldn't have fallen like that.

712
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:32,650
If she had fallen forward,
we'd have handprints.

713
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:33,730
True.

714
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:37,250
-So, how did she fall?
-I don't know.

715
00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:40,250
If she fell backwards,
there'd be hair in the blood.

716
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:41,370
Like this?

717
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:43,890
May I?

718
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:50,330
It's a reflex. When you fall forward,
you put out your hands.

719
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:55,090
-Danke schoen.
-At your service.

720
00:56:55,930 --> 00:56:57,010
What are you up to?

721
00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:02,530
What? Nothing.

722
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:05,450
Stop him
before he kills the whole family.

723
00:57:05,610 --> 00:57:08,050
I'm doing my best,
who are you, my mother?

724
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:09,730
I'm a long distance runner,

725
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:13,090
not a sprinter. I arrest people
when I have a full hand.

726
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:15,530
Look, I don't even have a body.

727
00:57:52,490 --> 00:57:54,050
Do you think he killed mom?

728
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:55,970
I don't know.

729
00:57:58,090 --> 00:58:00,890
-Where were you last night?
-None of your business.

730
00:58:01,290 --> 00:58:02,170
With him?

731
00:58:02,610 --> 00:58:04,690
I don't know why,
but I trust the guy.

732
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:06,530
You trust all men.

733
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:08,330
Don't drag that up. Jealous?

734
00:58:08,490 --> 00:58:09,810
Jealous of what, Pétra?

735
00:58:10,810 --> 00:58:12,970
I see how lonely you are.

736
00:58:13,410 --> 00:58:15,530
And I don't believe
in your perfect marriage.

737
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:17,930
I know Ruldophe's leaving you.

738
00:58:18,130 --> 00:58:21,170
When were you going to tell us
the brewery's bankrupt?

739
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:23,810
Little miss perfect,

740
00:58:24,690 --> 00:58:26,210
isn't so perfect now.

741
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:36,610
I'm sorry, Clara.

742
01:00:16,770 --> 01:00:18,730
Remember me, Mathis.

743
01:00:20,610 --> 01:00:21,890
Don't worry,

744
01:00:23,090 --> 01:00:25,090
everything will be fine, Mathis.

745
01:01:18,090 --> 01:01:21,810
Need back up, Meyer brewery.

746
01:03:01,050 --> 01:03:02,250
Oh look, you're up.

747
01:03:03,170 --> 01:03:04,770
I expect eternal gratitude.

748
01:03:04,930 --> 01:03:07,890
If it weren't for me,
you'd be at the pearly gates.

749
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:09,650
What happened?

750
01:03:10,570 --> 01:03:13,970
I was on my way to meet you,
like you asked.

751
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:17,810
I surprised your attacker
and found you drowning in blood.

752
01:03:17,970 --> 01:03:20,610
Did you get him, Nobécourt?

753
01:03:20,770 --> 01:03:22,410
We can't find him.

754
01:03:22,570 --> 01:03:23,690
What were you doing?

755
01:03:23,890 --> 01:03:24,970
What was I doing.

756
01:03:25,130 --> 01:03:27,250
Chasing after him, to the brewery.

757
01:03:27,410 --> 01:03:30,250
Then he started digging something up.

758
01:03:30,450 --> 01:03:32,850
I wanted to see what it was:
a woman's shoe.

759
01:03:32,970 --> 01:03:34,210
After that, nothing.

760
01:03:34,570 --> 01:03:35,650
-Lie down.
-Why?

761
01:03:36,130 --> 01:03:38,330
The doctor wants to keep you
overnight.

762
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:40,610
Take your observation and shove it.

763
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:43,410
Get my things, Oscar.

764
01:03:43,610 --> 01:03:44,890
Come on, let's go.

765
01:03:45,570 --> 01:03:46,930
Bloody hell.

766
01:03:47,410 --> 01:03:49,690
Oh shit... ow.

767
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:53,170
We're not together,
I don't know her at all.

768
01:03:53,690 --> 01:03:55,930
Captain? Where is that idiot?

769
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:58,130
Captain?

770
01:04:22,170 --> 01:04:23,370
Nobécourt?

771
01:04:38,370 --> 01:04:39,290
He split.

772
01:04:59,130 --> 01:05:00,290
Anyone there?

773
01:05:01,370 --> 01:05:02,490
You're still here?

774
01:05:04,970 --> 01:05:05,850
Hello?

775
01:05:07,610 --> 01:05:09,130
Wie ghet's herr doctor.

776
01:05:09,770 --> 01:05:10,810
Good timing.

777
01:05:11,930 --> 01:05:12,930
Hemoglobin.

778
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:16,690
Nonsense.
Those can't be blood spatters.

779
01:05:16,890 --> 01:05:20,290
That would mean Katel was killed here
and in her living room.

780
01:05:20,490 --> 01:05:23,530
People only die twice in the movies.

781
01:05:23,690 --> 01:05:27,690
I suggest you rethink
your line of reasoning,

782
01:05:28,610 --> 01:05:30,690
because reality
isn't going to change.

783
01:05:30,850 --> 01:05:33,770
And that, like it or not, is blood.

784
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,970
Watch out,

785
01:05:36,130 --> 01:05:38,850
I eat fat-heads like you
for breakfast.

786
01:05:39,050 --> 01:05:42,010
I don't care
how young you are, either.

787
01:05:42,130 --> 01:05:44,490
He saw her in the movies...

788
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:47,530
Flowering wheat...

789
01:05:47,690 --> 01:05:49,090
Did you see this?

790
01:05:49,530 --> 01:05:50,770
What is that?

791
01:05:50,970 --> 01:05:53,290
A bit of cloth
we found in the ground.

792
01:05:53,490 --> 01:05:54,690
Sorry.

793
01:05:58,130 --> 01:05:59,210
Yeah, Marleau.

794
01:05:59,850 --> 01:06:00,850
What?

795
01:06:01,330 --> 01:06:04,650
No kidding, you found him.
That's great. I'm on my way.

796
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:07,850
-See you later, sweetheart.
-Later.

797
01:06:29,490 --> 01:06:30,530
Officer.

798
01:06:33,010 --> 01:06:35,490
Leaving without saying goodbye?

799
01:06:35,690 --> 01:06:38,370
You didn't have to bash my head in,
you know.

800
01:06:38,810 --> 01:06:40,850
What are you're talking about?

801
01:06:41,010 --> 01:06:43,130
Let's spend a little time in custody.

802
01:06:43,770 --> 01:06:45,650
That always jogs the memory.

803
01:06:46,570 --> 01:06:47,570
Let's go.

804
01:07:06,730 --> 01:07:10,410
Why did you decide
to come here last winter?

805
01:07:10,570 --> 01:07:12,290
What happened?

806
01:07:12,970 --> 01:07:15,970
My adopted mother
died of a serious illness,

807
01:07:16,130 --> 01:07:17,730
and just before she died...

808
01:07:17,850 --> 01:07:20,930
She told you about
your biological mother.

809
01:07:21,090 --> 01:07:23,170
What she knew, which was not much.

810
01:07:23,370 --> 01:07:25,650
But it was enough to lead me
to Meyer's brewery.

811
01:07:29,290 --> 01:07:30,130
Thank you.

812
01:07:34,930 --> 01:07:36,650
I have three months left,

813
01:07:38,850 --> 01:07:40,290
we both know it,

814
01:07:40,930 --> 01:07:43,010
let's not beat about the bush.

815
01:07:44,610 --> 01:07:45,570
To me,

816
01:07:47,130 --> 01:07:48,730
genetics,

817
01:07:50,810 --> 01:07:52,570
all that stuff,

818
01:07:53,850 --> 01:07:54,690
it's nonsense.

819
01:07:57,010 --> 01:07:57,890
You're my son.

820
01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:03,570
More than hers.

821
01:08:04,010 --> 01:08:05,010
I know, mother.

822
01:08:05,690 --> 01:08:09,170
What I'm about to tell you
might upset you.

823
01:08:10,010 --> 01:08:10,810
I lied to you.

824
01:08:12,290 --> 01:08:13,850
I did it for you.

825
01:08:14,370 --> 01:08:17,450
So you wouldn't go looking
for your mother for nothing.

826
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:20,450
But trying to do good by someone,

827
01:08:20,570 --> 01:08:24,010
is the best way to ruin their life.

828
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:29,290
I don't know anything about
your birth,

829
01:08:32,370 --> 01:08:33,810
not much in any case.

830
01:08:35,530 --> 01:08:38,290
A priest

831
01:08:39,570 --> 01:08:43,010
found you on the steps of a church.

832
01:08:43,130 --> 01:08:45,850
It was in Haguenau.

833
01:08:46,890 --> 01:08:48,250
In Alsace.

834
01:08:51,330 --> 01:08:53,450
-But you told me...
-I know.

835
01:08:53,610 --> 01:08:57,010
Anonymous birth.

836
01:08:58,730 --> 01:09:00,450
Parents unknown.

837
01:09:02,650 --> 01:09:04,010
End of story.

838
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:07,730
Well, it's not true.

839
01:09:08,730 --> 01:09:11,010
I lied so you could live your life.

840
01:09:11,250 --> 01:09:13,570
I didn't want you to
miss out on things

841
01:09:13,770 --> 01:09:16,610
searching for people
you would never find.

842
01:09:17,850 --> 01:09:21,970
There's nothing else I can tell you.
Not much anyway.

843
01:09:22,130 --> 01:09:23,570
Tell me anyway.

844
01:09:24,530 --> 01:09:26,010
Please, tell me.

845
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:31,290
According to the priest,
you had an earring

846
01:09:32,850 --> 01:09:34,570
clutched in one hand.

847
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:38,850
And you were holding a napkin,

848
01:09:39,450 --> 01:09:40,890
with a coat of arms.

849
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:43,250
It's there,

850
01:09:44,130 --> 01:09:45,290
in the drawer.

851
01:09:55,370 --> 01:09:56,730
My boy.

852
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:04,290
My son.

853
01:10:10,450 --> 01:10:12,010
She died a month later.

854
01:10:13,850 --> 01:10:15,730
Little by little, what she told me

855
01:10:15,890 --> 01:10:19,010
started to consume me. Literally.

856
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:21,530
It's all I thought about.

857
01:10:22,890 --> 01:10:25,850
When I saw the brewery for sale,
I decided to come.

858
01:10:29,410 --> 01:10:30,410
Excuse me.

859
01:10:32,250 --> 01:10:33,290
Yeah?

860
01:10:34,410 --> 01:10:35,290
I'm on my way!

861
01:10:35,730 --> 01:10:37,490
-Carpentier?
-Yes, Captain?

862
01:10:38,050 --> 01:10:40,490
Guard the door.
And don't let him leave.

863
01:10:41,850 --> 01:10:44,410
-What's going on?
-I was waiting for you.

864
01:10:48,450 --> 01:10:49,330
Yeah...

865
01:10:50,290 --> 01:10:51,770
And now this one.

866
01:10:54,210 --> 01:10:55,170
OK.

867
01:10:56,170 --> 01:10:59,330
The blood we found
in the malt house isn't Katel's.

868
01:10:59,570 --> 01:11:02,290
Someone was killed there,
but over 40 years ago.

869
01:11:02,450 --> 01:11:03,690
Forty years ago?

870
01:11:05,410 --> 01:11:06,450
It gets better.

871
01:11:08,290 --> 01:11:09,730
DNA analysis shows

872
01:11:09,930 --> 01:11:13,410
that Dimitri and the victim
are related.

873
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:17,450
His mother?

874
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:21,730
It's true, they sure do look alike.

875
01:11:23,450 --> 01:11:26,330
Analysis indicates
she died of a brain injury

876
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:28,570
caused by a blow to the head.

877
01:11:28,730 --> 01:11:30,770
That means, in fact,

878
01:11:31,570 --> 01:11:35,290
that Dimitri's mother
didn't abandon him, she just died.

879
01:11:36,210 --> 01:11:37,610
It gets better.

880
01:11:38,490 --> 01:11:41,450
We found another DNA match
for Nobécourt.

881
01:12:00,610 --> 01:12:02,050
There's no doubt about it.

882
01:12:02,730 --> 01:12:05,330
We know who
we're going to dig up in the barn.

883
01:12:05,970 --> 01:12:07,330
Your biological mother.

884
01:12:10,610 --> 01:12:11,490
Thank you.

885
01:12:13,650 --> 01:12:15,850
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

886
01:12:17,570 --> 01:12:21,610
We also found out
who your real father was.

887
01:12:22,650 --> 01:12:24,050
It's my big day.

888
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:26,290
I'm listening.

889
01:12:27,730 --> 01:12:30,570
It's Franz Meyer,
but you knew that already.

890
01:12:32,730 --> 01:12:34,490
I might have suspected it.

891
01:12:36,170 --> 01:12:37,890
When he asked to meet that night,

892
01:12:38,450 --> 01:12:40,170
I thought that's why.

893
01:13:08,730 --> 01:13:10,290
I was the ideal suspect.

894
01:13:11,210 --> 01:13:13,650
My only option was
to hide my ties to the family.

895
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:15,330
That way, I had no motive.

896
01:13:15,490 --> 01:13:17,170
Why didn't you just leave,

897
01:13:17,490 --> 01:13:19,290
when you still had the chance?

898
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:21,890
And look guilty?

899
01:13:23,650 --> 01:13:26,170
I wanted to know what happened
to my mother.

900
01:13:28,090 --> 01:13:30,930
So you asked Mrs Meyer
in the middle of the night?

901
01:13:31,810 --> 01:13:35,730
You voice your suspicions,
only she's not having any of it,

902
01:13:36,170 --> 01:13:37,570
and fights back, right?

903
01:13:37,730 --> 01:13:39,050
I should have defended myself.

904
01:13:39,570 --> 01:13:41,490
That's why I killed her there.

905
01:13:45,050 --> 01:13:46,570
He was mine.

906
01:13:54,450 --> 01:13:55,210
Mine!

907
01:13:55,370 --> 01:13:56,050
So...

908
01:13:57,610 --> 01:14:00,010
You figure out that Mrs Meyer

909
01:14:00,170 --> 01:14:02,210
caught them one day in the brewery,

910
01:14:02,410 --> 01:14:05,010
the two of them
getting down to business,

911
01:14:05,210 --> 01:14:08,890
and she killed your
biological mother.

912
01:14:09,290 --> 01:14:11,490
You lose it then,

913
01:14:11,690 --> 01:14:13,050
you grab her,

914
01:14:13,210 --> 01:14:16,650
throw her around the room...

915
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:20,050
...and you kill her.

916
01:14:20,210 --> 01:14:21,650
I was a coward.

917
01:14:22,170 --> 01:14:23,210
I left.

918
01:14:26,770 --> 01:14:28,730
I ran into Pétra on the way out.

919
01:14:28,890 --> 01:14:30,450
I told her to go see her mother.

920
01:14:31,370 --> 01:14:33,810
She can confirm
Mrs Meyer was still alive.

921
01:14:39,090 --> 01:14:41,010
Sorry, this is a private party.

922
01:14:41,170 --> 01:14:42,290
Private?

923
01:14:42,450 --> 01:14:43,330
Take a walk.

924
01:14:43,490 --> 01:14:45,330
Private? I'm in the public sector.

925
01:14:45,490 --> 01:14:46,890
My mistake.

926
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:48,610
Changes everything, doesn't it?

927
01:14:49,370 --> 01:14:50,450
Ladies and gents!

928
01:15:22,330 --> 01:15:23,730
Want to dance, Captain?

929
01:15:24,330 --> 01:15:26,170
I can't stand stewed chicks.

930
01:15:28,050 --> 01:15:29,490
Coming through!

931
01:15:31,090 --> 01:15:32,330
It stinks.

932
01:15:34,010 --> 01:15:35,250
What shitty music.

933
01:15:35,450 --> 01:15:37,170
A coffee, please.

934
01:15:37,650 --> 01:15:39,450
Drink this, you need it.

935
01:15:43,450 --> 01:15:47,530
The night your mother disappeared,
Dimitri went to see her.

936
01:15:47,730 --> 01:15:50,210
Was she still alive when he left?

937
01:15:50,410 --> 01:15:53,170
-Who said I ran into Dimitri?
-Him. Who else?

938
01:15:53,330 --> 01:15:55,330
-He's lying.
-Lying?

939
01:15:56,890 --> 01:15:58,370
Let me explain something.

940
01:15:58,570 --> 01:16:02,370
If you don't speak up,
he's going down. OK?

941
01:16:03,330 --> 01:16:04,330
So?

942
01:16:08,090 --> 01:16:09,810
OK, I ran into him.

943
01:16:10,010 --> 01:16:12,250
But I don't know if
she was still alive.

944
01:16:12,490 --> 01:16:15,890
He said you were on your way
to the house when he ran into you.

945
01:16:16,050 --> 01:16:18,890
-What happened? You change your mind?
-Yes.

946
01:16:22,170 --> 01:16:24,330
I'm going to tell you something, kid.

947
01:16:24,450 --> 01:16:26,250
This is serious, okay.

948
01:16:26,450 --> 01:16:29,330
No one cares about
your little rich kid problems.

949
01:16:29,770 --> 01:16:31,810
You want to waste your life,
go ahead.

950
01:16:32,010 --> 01:16:36,370
But if you don't talk, he'll get
15 years in the pen. Understand?

951
01:16:36,810 --> 01:16:39,610
Ter stand? 15 years!

952
01:16:40,650 --> 01:16:43,090
So, you're protecting someone.

953
01:16:43,250 --> 01:16:44,650
Who?

954
01:16:46,770 --> 01:16:47,970
I'm listening.

955
01:16:49,850 --> 01:16:52,330
After I talked to Dimitri,
I had a smoke.

956
01:16:53,490 --> 01:16:55,530
I had to ask mom about something.

957
01:16:56,130 --> 01:16:58,130
I needed to borrow money.

958
01:17:00,610 --> 01:17:02,050
So I stalled a bit.

959
01:17:06,250 --> 01:17:07,330
And?

960
01:17:08,770 --> 01:17:10,090
Everything was quiet,

961
01:17:10,890 --> 01:17:12,410
but the light was on.

962
01:17:12,610 --> 01:17:15,250
I don't know why,
but I had a bad feeling.

963
01:17:15,970 --> 01:17:19,330
Instead of going inside,
I looked in at the window.

964
01:17:24,610 --> 01:17:26,330
There must be an explanation.

965
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:28,850
Ja, Ja, Ja, genau.

966
01:17:29,810 --> 01:17:31,050
I'm going home.

967
01:17:31,170 --> 01:17:32,890
-Together?
-What?

968
01:17:33,050 --> 01:17:34,850
-You and I?
-Ha.

969
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:37,410
You're drunk. Watch out for yourself.

970
01:17:37,610 --> 01:17:39,170
See you later, ciao.

971
01:17:39,890 --> 01:17:42,050
Look out, police.

972
01:17:54,130 --> 01:17:55,530
No minors allowed.

973
01:17:55,690 --> 01:17:57,490
No smoking inside, either.

974
01:18:09,770 --> 01:18:10,850
Miss?

975
01:18:13,050 --> 01:18:14,890
Augustine Meyer,

976
01:18:15,050 --> 01:18:17,970
you're under arrest
for the murder of your parents.

977
01:18:18,170 --> 01:18:20,810
You have a right to an attorney.

978
01:18:21,850 --> 01:18:22,690
I won't need one.

979
01:18:22,850 --> 01:18:25,410
You have the right to representation.

980
01:18:25,690 --> 01:18:27,090
I'm guilty.

981
01:18:29,210 --> 01:18:30,890
The night Dimitri arrived,

982
01:18:31,050 --> 01:18:34,330
Dad said he was going to see him,
he'd figured it all out.

983
01:18:34,930 --> 01:18:38,490
Dimitri Nobécourt,

984
01:18:38,650 --> 01:18:39,970
it's Mathis!

985
01:18:40,890 --> 01:18:43,490
Yes, Bénédicte's son.

986
01:18:44,130 --> 01:18:46,210
He has her eyes.

987
01:18:46,570 --> 01:18:48,770
Maybe he has her eyes,

988
01:18:49,290 --> 01:18:52,690
but he has your smile.
You think I'm blind, Franz?

989
01:18:52,890 --> 01:18:54,530
I knew who the father was.

990
01:18:54,650 --> 01:18:56,970
-How long have you known?
-About her?

991
01:18:57,490 --> 01:18:58,610
Since last week.

992
01:18:58,770 --> 01:19:02,010
When I walked in on you
in the malt house

993
01:19:02,930 --> 01:19:04,650
rolling around in the barley!

994
01:19:04,770 --> 01:19:06,290
What did you do, Katel?

995
01:19:08,010 --> 01:19:09,370
What did you do?

996
01:19:11,210 --> 01:19:12,690
What did you do to her?

997
01:19:13,890 --> 01:19:16,210
He got angrier and angrier.

998
01:19:16,370 --> 01:19:18,850
He was going to hurt her.
So I stopped him.

999
01:19:19,050 --> 01:19:22,490
I came at him from behind
with a bronze statue.

1000
01:19:24,490 --> 01:19:28,610
You figured a set-up
would frame Dimitri.

1001
01:19:29,610 --> 01:19:31,650
You are evil, Augustine.

1002
01:19:34,370 --> 01:19:35,130
I knew

1003
01:19:36,010 --> 01:19:39,890
father had arranged to meet Dimitri
at the entrance. He'd just told us.

1004
01:19:41,050 --> 01:19:43,290
So I moved his body there.

1005
01:19:43,850 --> 01:19:46,650
I knew Dimitri would be
accused sooner or later.

1006
01:19:47,290 --> 01:19:48,850
He had the perfect motive.

1007
01:19:49,010 --> 01:19:51,250
All that was missing was evidence.

1008
01:19:55,610 --> 01:19:56,570
Yeah...

1009
01:19:57,850 --> 01:19:58,930
Assuming that's true.

1010
01:20:01,170 --> 01:20:02,490
Why then,

1011
01:20:03,570 --> 01:20:05,930
did you kill your mother?

1012
01:20:07,810 --> 01:20:10,570
She was sick.
She'd have let it slip.

1013
01:20:10,770 --> 01:20:13,570
Especially
once you found Bénédicte's body.

1014
01:20:18,010 --> 01:20:19,250
That was you?

1015
01:20:20,930 --> 01:20:21,570
Thanks.

1016
01:20:22,410 --> 01:20:25,210
You really are evil, Augustine.

1017
01:20:27,010 --> 01:20:28,730
I was afraid she'd talk.

1018
01:20:28,930 --> 01:20:32,410
OK, so you killed her.

1019
01:20:32,610 --> 01:20:36,570
Now you're going to tell me
how you killed your mother.

1020
01:20:37,690 --> 01:20:38,610
Does it matter?

1021
01:20:38,770 --> 01:20:42,370
I like to know
what's being shoved down my throat.

1022
01:20:42,530 --> 01:20:43,810
I'm listening.

1023
01:20:46,610 --> 01:20:49,010
We fought,
and I pushed her against the table.

1024
01:20:49,210 --> 01:20:50,530
How did she fall?

1025
01:20:50,730 --> 01:20:54,210
Forward? Backward?
Her forehead, the back of her head?

1026
01:20:55,770 --> 01:20:57,930
-I don't remember.
-You don't remember.

1027
01:20:58,090 --> 01:21:01,170
What did you do with her body?

1028
01:21:02,730 --> 01:21:03,930
Threw it in the lake.

1029
01:21:05,810 --> 01:21:08,930
How convenient,
"I threw it in the lake."

1030
01:21:09,770 --> 01:21:11,890
Maybe you used
a little concrete, too?

1031
01:21:12,050 --> 01:21:15,650
Stop this nonsense.
Let's take it from the top again.

1032
01:21:15,810 --> 01:21:18,730
You watch too much television.
I'm listening.

1033
01:21:21,490 --> 01:21:23,290
Augustine confessed,

1034
01:21:24,130 --> 01:21:25,850
she says she did it.

1035
01:21:26,010 --> 01:21:27,690
You're free to go.

1036
01:21:27,890 --> 01:21:29,530
-Augustine?
-Yeah.

1037
01:21:31,770 --> 01:21:34,090
I'd like to collect
my mother's remains.

1038
01:21:35,530 --> 01:21:37,650
I'll take care of it. Follow me.

1039
01:21:58,050 --> 01:21:59,770
-Has the captain arrived?
-No.

1040
01:21:59,930 --> 01:22:02,410
-She'll be here soon.
-Guess we'll wait.

1041
01:22:02,810 --> 01:22:04,210
-Yeah.
-OK.

1042
01:22:07,050 --> 01:22:11,250
Since we didn't find anything,
we don't need to hang around.

1043
01:22:11,450 --> 01:22:14,330
When the captain gets here,
we wrap it up, okay?

1044
01:22:21,490 --> 01:22:22,890
-Captain.
-Well?

1045
01:22:23,650 --> 01:22:24,810
What's going on?

1046
01:22:25,170 --> 01:22:28,130
We dredged the lake as arranged.

1047
01:22:28,290 --> 01:22:30,050
We didn't find much.

1048
01:22:30,210 --> 01:22:32,530
A pair of panties, a cigar case,

1049
01:22:32,690 --> 01:22:34,810
a pretty statuette of a nymph,

1050
01:22:35,010 --> 01:22:38,050
but unfortunately, no body.

1051
01:22:39,170 --> 01:22:40,450
That's odd.

1052
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:42,330
What do you think?

1053
01:22:43,050 --> 01:22:47,170
It'd be a first, but if Augustine
didn't kill her mother,

1054
01:22:47,890 --> 01:22:50,330
then she's covering for someone.

1055
01:22:51,250 --> 01:22:53,930
Someone, nobody, no body...

1056
01:22:54,090 --> 01:22:56,050
A crime scene that makes no sense.

1057
01:22:56,770 --> 01:22:58,210
What a rotten case.

1058
01:23:23,650 --> 01:23:27,210
You should be in the police station,
not my Augustine!

1059
01:23:27,370 --> 01:23:29,530
You piece of trash!

1060
01:23:31,330 --> 01:23:33,810
Look at me.

1061
01:23:35,530 --> 01:23:36,810
No!

1062
01:23:37,970 --> 01:23:40,210
What is he...

1063
01:23:41,410 --> 01:23:42,690
Leave her alone.

1064
01:23:43,330 --> 01:23:44,450
Leave her.

1065
01:23:49,410 --> 01:23:50,370
Shit.

1066
01:23:50,810 --> 01:23:51,890
God...!

1067
01:23:53,610 --> 01:23:54,690
What?

1068
01:23:54,850 --> 01:23:57,450
I'm in the middle of a family crisis.

1069
01:24:00,970 --> 01:24:03,050
Why didn't you say so? I'm on my way.

1070
01:24:14,850 --> 01:24:15,890
Second floor.

1071
01:24:33,090 --> 01:24:34,330
Mrs Meyer?

1072
01:24:34,490 --> 01:24:35,650
Mrs Meyer?

1073
01:24:42,770 --> 01:24:44,530
Oh, little Mathis!

1074
01:24:47,130 --> 01:24:49,250
Now who is this lady?

1075
01:24:59,370 --> 01:25:00,450
Hello.

1076
01:25:05,130 --> 01:25:06,570
Come on, Mrs Meyer.

1077
01:25:09,170 --> 01:25:12,730
Is your memory coming back to you?

1078
01:25:13,970 --> 01:25:16,370
Will you tell her to leave me alone?

1079
01:25:17,570 --> 01:25:19,570
Convenient excuse, that Alzheimer's.

1080
01:25:21,410 --> 01:25:23,490
You wanted to protect her from that.

1081
01:25:24,050 --> 01:25:25,810
A rotten family secret.

1082
01:25:27,050 --> 01:25:30,610
You witnessed a murder
when you were a kid, didn't you?

1083
01:25:31,810 --> 01:25:34,490
No one knew we were there.
It wasn't our home back then.

1084
01:25:35,690 --> 01:25:37,810
It was hers, Bénédicte Hartmann's.

1085
01:25:40,330 --> 01:25:43,970
I could come and go as I pleased
because I took care of her son,

1086
01:25:44,610 --> 01:25:45,970
and he liked me.

1087
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:59,610
Except that day,
someone came in. So I looked.

1088
01:26:05,250 --> 01:26:07,770
It was mother and Bénédicte, arguing.

1089
01:26:08,170 --> 01:26:10,050
Do you have something to say?

1090
01:26:10,930 --> 01:26:13,410
-He wants to leave me for you.
-What?

1091
01:26:13,530 --> 01:26:14,690
I see you!

1092
01:26:15,330 --> 01:26:18,130
The way he looks at you,
the secret meetings.

1093
01:26:18,530 --> 01:26:20,050
Why didn't you speak up?

1094
01:26:20,610 --> 01:26:23,690
Because I love him.
I couldn't bear it if he left.

1095
01:26:24,210 --> 01:26:25,490
I know it's you.

1096
01:26:25,650 --> 01:26:27,650
Katel, I don't want your husband.

1097
01:26:27,810 --> 01:26:31,210
Or anyone elses. I'd have found
my own if I wanted one!

1098
01:26:31,370 --> 01:26:33,130
I want to be free,

1099
01:26:33,290 --> 01:26:35,610
to love whom I want, when I want.

1100
01:26:35,810 --> 01:26:38,370
I have many loves,
but they will all expire.

1101
01:26:38,530 --> 01:26:41,330
Your husband doesn't mean
any more than any other.

1102
01:26:41,450 --> 01:26:42,930
He's nothing.

1103
01:27:06,850 --> 01:27:08,890
Mother started the rumor that...

1104
01:27:09,650 --> 01:27:12,450
Bénéndicte took off with a customer.

1105
01:27:12,610 --> 01:27:14,370
So the house was sold,

1106
01:27:14,530 --> 01:27:16,210
and her little boy adopted.

1107
01:27:16,370 --> 01:27:18,170
That's why she wanted to buy it.

1108
01:27:18,330 --> 01:27:22,170
To prevent anyone from digging around
and discovering your secret.

1109
01:27:22,330 --> 01:27:23,450
Not only that.

1110
01:27:23,930 --> 01:27:25,650
It was mother's revenge.

1111
01:27:26,330 --> 01:27:28,370
Bénédicte Hartmann humiliated her.

1112
01:27:28,850 --> 01:27:30,410
I heard them talking.

1113
01:27:30,570 --> 01:27:32,490
Not so great now, are you?

1114
01:27:32,690 --> 01:27:36,450
Ten years of humiliation,
of ordering me around.

1115
01:27:36,610 --> 01:27:40,290
Sending me off on errands
so you could screw my husband.

1116
01:27:40,450 --> 01:27:41,970
Bitch.

1117
01:27:45,930 --> 01:27:47,890
And her husband, your father?

1118
01:27:48,970 --> 01:27:52,370
He was devastated.
In the end, he got over it.

1119
01:27:52,530 --> 01:27:56,930
Until little Mathis,
now Dimitri all grown up, appeared.

1120
01:27:57,090 --> 01:28:00,650
He figured out that mother had lied,

1121
01:28:01,690 --> 01:28:03,570
that Bénédicte hadn't left.

1122
01:28:03,730 --> 01:28:04,730
What did you do?

1123
01:28:05,810 --> 01:28:07,450
What did you do to Bénédicte?

1124
01:28:29,370 --> 01:28:32,050
You are a devil in angel's garb.

1125
01:28:32,250 --> 01:28:36,410
Make it look like your mother
was killed in order to exonerate her.

1126
01:28:36,570 --> 01:28:38,130
Bravo.

1127
01:28:52,290 --> 01:28:53,250
Mother,

1128
01:28:54,010 --> 01:28:55,250
don't worry, mother.

1129
01:28:55,410 --> 01:28:56,370
Mother.

1130
01:28:57,490 --> 01:28:59,570
Take this.

1131
01:29:01,610 --> 01:29:04,530
You're going to sleep
somewhere else tonight.

1132
01:29:06,050 --> 01:29:07,450
Trust me, mother.

1133
01:29:08,610 --> 01:29:10,330
That's it now.

1134
01:29:15,090 --> 01:29:16,050
Everything's okay.

1135
01:29:18,250 --> 01:29:19,450
You know, mother,

1136
01:29:19,970 --> 01:29:22,370
Bénédicte didn't die right away.

1137
01:29:22,530 --> 01:29:23,930
She looked at us a while.

1138
01:29:24,730 --> 01:29:27,010
Full of reproach. Do you remember?

1139
01:29:27,130 --> 01:29:28,450
No, that's not right.

1140
01:29:28,610 --> 01:29:31,690
She looked at her son, little Mathis.

1141
01:29:31,850 --> 01:29:33,330
She smiled at him.

1142
01:29:33,490 --> 01:29:35,930
I see her face in my dreams.
Don't you?

1143
01:29:36,090 --> 01:29:38,810
I dream about her all the time.

1144
01:29:39,490 --> 01:29:42,210
She's rolling around with my Franz,

1145
01:29:42,370 --> 01:29:44,370
and she laughs, and laughs,

1146
01:29:44,530 --> 01:29:48,290
and I get close to her,
and I bend over her,

1147
01:29:48,490 --> 01:29:52,410
and I hit her,
with my feet and my fists,

1148
01:29:53,010 --> 01:29:56,610
she has to shut up, to stop laughing.

1149
01:29:57,090 --> 01:29:59,490
You have no remorse,
not even for the boy.

1150
01:29:59,650 --> 01:30:02,930
I'm late! The boss is going to
chew my head off.

1151
01:30:03,090 --> 01:30:04,210
Let go of me.

1152
01:30:04,850 --> 01:30:07,170
I told you,
I'm going to get chewed out.

1153
01:30:08,050 --> 01:30:10,010
-Customers are waiting!
-Mother.

1154
01:30:10,170 --> 01:30:12,610
No! Who are you?

1155
01:30:13,410 --> 01:30:16,850
Who are you? I have to go.

1156
01:30:17,290 --> 01:30:19,930
Franz is waiting for me.
He'll be worried.

1157
01:30:20,050 --> 01:30:21,690
You can't go out, mother.

1158
01:30:21,850 --> 01:30:23,810
Franz, Franz!

1159
01:30:23,970 --> 01:30:26,650
They're trying
to keep me from seeing you!

1160
01:30:26,810 --> 01:30:29,890
I did all that for her.
She doesn't even recognize me.

1161
01:30:39,090 --> 01:30:43,410
Don't be sad,
I didn't do it on purpose.

1162
01:30:44,970 --> 01:30:46,890
Forgive me.

1163
01:30:47,090 --> 01:30:50,490
I won't do it ever again...
dear mother.

1164
01:33:07,570 --> 01:33:09,570
What does "happy hours" mean?

1165
01:33:09,730 --> 01:33:11,210
It's less expensive.

1166
01:33:11,850 --> 01:33:14,450
Great! Drinks are on me.

1167
01:33:19,650 --> 01:33:21,210
Hello.

1168
01:33:21,730 --> 01:33:23,170
Something to drink?

1169
01:33:23,330 --> 01:33:25,490
A beer, please.

1170
01:33:27,290 --> 01:33:28,210
How are you?

1171
01:33:33,530 --> 01:33:34,650
Hello.

1172
01:33:34,810 --> 01:33:38,090
Captain!
I brought you a little souvenir.

1173
01:33:40,090 --> 01:33:41,570
That's so nice.

1174
01:33:42,210 --> 01:33:44,490
Thanks. What is it?

1175
01:33:44,650 --> 01:33:46,610
It's not a surprise if I tell you.

1176
01:33:47,930 --> 01:33:49,090
No way.

1177
01:33:52,250 --> 01:33:56,370
Thanks. Every time I hear a cow,
I'll think of you.

1178
01:33:59,490 --> 01:34:00,650
Happy hours!

1179
01:34:01,890 --> 01:34:03,890
Happy hours!

1180
01:35:07,610 --> 01:35:08,810
