1
00:00:15,064 --> 00:00:16,148
Hi!

2
00:00:16,168 --> 00:00:18,090
Captain Marleau?
- Yeah!

3
00:00:18,094 --> 00:00:20,524
Mario.
- Nice to meet you.

4
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:24,235
We don't have a head Republican Guard?

5
00:00:24,236 --> 00:00:26,908
You have a head to work in CID?

6
00:00:26,909 --> 00:00:30,252
Me, I don't parade with the
spiked helmets!

7
00:00:30,253 --> 00:00:31,903
Is this my pony?
- No.

8
00:00:31,904 --> 00:00:34,528
We don't let you drive a Formula 1.

9
00:00:34,797 --> 00:00:36,223
That's yours.

10
00:00:36,224 --> 00:00:38,441
Equestrian segregation!
- I see.

11
00:00:38,442 --> 00:00:40,901
Hello. Hi, my bunny! How are you?

12
00:00:41,106 --> 00:00:42,755
Go on!
- Like that?

13
00:00:42,756 --> 00:00:46,083
Yes, facing the horse. The other leg.
Left leg! Left leg.

14
00:00:46,103 --> 00:00:47,304
Left... Left leg.
Left!

15
00:00:47,305 --> 00:00:50,341
In the stirrup. We'll adjust the reins.
- We'll adjust the reins.

16
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:52,295
Hold onto the mane.
- Like this?

17
00:00:52,296 --> 00:00:54,885
That's it. Foot in the stirrup.
- Like that?

18
00:00:54,933 --> 00:00:56,635
That's right, and:
- Yeah.

19
00:00:56,951 --> 00:00:58,535
grab the raised part at the back of
the saddle and mount.

20
00:00:58,536 --> 00:01:01,741
Yeah, but; you have to push my ass.

21
00:01:01,742 --> 00:01:03,524
You're funny!
- Mount the saddle.!

22
00:01:05,776 --> 00:01:07,782
Really?
- It can't be true.

23
00:01:41,705 --> 00:01:44,028
TWO LIVES

24
00:02:26,687 --> 00:02:27,979
Elodie?

25
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:30,778
Sorry? Do we know each other?

26
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:33,606
10 years,

27
00:02:34,403 --> 00:02:35,715
with no news,

28
00:02:35,901 --> 00:02:37,456
and you just show up like that.

29
00:02:39,111 --> 00:02:42,752
I know, I blame myself, when
I couldn't-

30
00:02:42,753 --> 00:02:46,930
Of course you could! You could
pick up a phone!

31
00:02:48,189 --> 00:02:50,486
A call? You really believe that?

32
00:02:52,331 --> 00:02:54,042
Can you imagine what Garance
went through?

33
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:56,535
And Jonathan?

34
00:02:57,993 --> 00:02:59,298
What's wrong?

35
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:02,389
Nothing.

36
00:03:02,426 --> 00:03:05,114
As if. But you haven't come
for nothing.

37
00:03:05,932 --> 00:03:09,118
You said you were in love.
What's the problem?

38
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:12,057
I love my life, but I often feel alone.

39
00:03:12,324 --> 00:03:16,105
OK, so you come to see your
old friend Elodie?

40
00:03:17,869 --> 00:03:19,439
I missed you.

41
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:23,011
I want to reconnect with this
part of my life.

42
00:03:23,012 --> 00:03:24,258
All right.

43
00:03:25,411 --> 00:03:28,715
And you think that part of your life
wants to reconnect with you?

44
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,151
Hey.

45
00:04:24,152 --> 00:04:25,706
You show up now with no warning?

46
00:04:25,707 --> 00:04:27,692
I didn't want to bother you.

47
00:04:27,693 --> 00:04:29,975
And the photos, are those of birds?

48
00:04:31,626 --> 00:04:33,087
It's my lawyer's idea.

49
00:04:33,088 --> 00:04:36,399
Photos could sway the judge's decision.

50
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,134
Go on, get off my land.

51
00:04:40,274 --> 00:04:42,148
Enjoy your home, Christophe,

52
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:43,586
on Friday it's over.

53
00:05:11,004 --> 00:05:12,528
Eric was here.

54
00:05:14,049 --> 00:05:16,588
You let him go without saying
anything?

55
00:05:17,524 --> 00:05:18,837
What did you want me to do?

56
00:05:19,807 --> 00:05:22,719
Something, for a change!

57
00:05:24,913 --> 00:05:27,616
I saw you with Eric.
What did he want?

58
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:30,126
Nothing in particular.

59
00:05:38,281 --> 00:05:41,992
Same puzzle as yesterday, Louise?
Not making much progress!

60
00:05:42,852 --> 00:05:44,977
It's level 5!

61
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:47,594
Mind your onions.

62
00:05:54,668 --> 00:05:56,224
Are you taking me to the
restaurant tonight?

63
00:05:56,951 --> 00:05:59,498
No, not tonight, sorry.

64
00:05:59,499 --> 00:06:02,354
It would do us good.
- I know, but no.

65
00:06:02,355 --> 00:06:05,744
I have too many things on my mind,
the farm, and all that.

66
00:06:06,006 --> 00:06:08,575
Next time, okay? Yeah?

67
00:07:40,556 --> 00:07:44,718
Should rain. Ground is dry above the barn.

68
00:07:44,719 --> 00:07:48,423
You started sowing in the
northern plot!

69
00:07:48,451 --> 00:07:51,608
Your father always started in
the southern part.

70
00:07:51,609 --> 00:07:55,501
The land is also dry in the south.
- We'll see in 10 days, when nothing

71
00:07:55,502 --> 00:07:59,653
will have sprouted!
- We'll see, yes.

72
00:07:59,841 --> 00:08:01,591
I've seen it all, moron!

73
00:08:04,713 --> 00:08:08,220
Laetitia isn't here?
- Having trouble seeing?

74
00:08:23,156 --> 00:08:24,671
Big ride.

75
00:08:27,584 --> 00:08:28,936
Alright, comrades?

76
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:34,553
Come on, come on; it's okay,
it's okay.

77
00:08:35,467 --> 00:08:36,709
She's 10?

78
00:08:40,069 --> 00:08:41,516
Thanks, bunny!

79
00:08:42,936 --> 00:08:44,077
So?

80
00:08:44,897 --> 00:08:46,795
Fuck! Was she strangled?

81
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:50,921
Are you the one in charge?
- I didn't do anything.

82
00:08:50,922 --> 00:08:52,515
Immediately with the prejudice!

83
00:08:52,678 --> 00:08:54,366
Are there indications other
than that?

84
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:59,576
Yes, bruises all over the place.
- Get me a coffee, please?

85
00:09:00,103 --> 00:09:02,374
Look at her.

86
00:09:02,747 --> 00:09:06,653
On the back, the hips.
- No, that's cellulite. Yeah.

87
00:09:07,262 --> 00:09:09,473
What do you think happened?

88
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:14,020
Fell on her back: the horse reared,
knocking her off.

89
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:17,686
The usual yada yada, someone
goes "Waaa!"

90
00:09:17,687 --> 00:09:20,019
The horse goes "Heeee," she goes bang!

91
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:20,985
Captain Marleau!

92
00:09:21,005 --> 00:09:22,896
Ha ha!

93
00:09:23,876 --> 00:09:26,829
Briere!
- I'm happy to see you again.

94
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:31,452
What are you doing in Correze?
Had enough of the seaside?

95
00:09:31,463 --> 00:09:34,166
I asked for a transfer after
I got commendations.

96
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,358
The seaside attracts cityfolk. At the
slightest sign of crime,

97
00:09:36,359 --> 00:09:38,204
the Paris guys are on our backs.

98
00:09:38,337 --> 00:09:39,640
"Parigot," calf's head!

99
00:09:39,641 --> 00:09:40,711
That's it.
- Yes.

100
00:09:40,712 --> 00:09:45,728
Saut Balou is my horse-friend.
Now what about this good woman?

101
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,123
Is she baroness-of-the-hunt,
privileged?

102
00:09:50,124 --> 00:09:52,322
No, a farmer's wife.

103
00:09:52,323 --> 00:09:56,417
Mr. Lemaire, companion of the victim.
He found the body.

104
00:09:56,418 --> 00:09:57,597
Dumpling,

105
00:09:57,598 --> 00:10:01,301
er, my condolences.
- No need to force it. Questions?

106
00:10:01,302 --> 00:10:04,479
No. Did she often ride?
- Everyday.

107
00:10:05,054 --> 00:10:07,617
At the same time?
- Mornings.

108
00:10:07,618 --> 00:10:09,785
She liked to start her day on horseback.

109
00:10:09,786 --> 00:10:12,133
Doesn't everyone? Yeah.

110
00:10:12,725 --> 00:10:16,710
Will you excuse me, this is my friend,
I haven't seen him for a long time.

111
00:10:17,792 --> 00:10:21,274
Got something on this guy?
- You suspect he did it?

112
00:10:21,275 --> 00:10:25,087
It's the guys who strangle their
wives, not the horses.

113
00:10:25,102 --> 00:10:29,493
That's true; he's a farmer. According
to my colleagues,

114
00:10:29,494 --> 00:10:33,753
he and his wife were discreet,
the kind of hard workers

115
00:10:33,754 --> 00:10:36,580
dedicated to the family business.
- Okay.

116
00:10:37,712 --> 00:10:40,564
Shall we take him in?
- No, he just lost his wife!

117
00:10:40,565 --> 00:10:43,648
And we don't have any proof.
- It's you who says-

118
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:45,061
You know me!

119
00:10:45,975 --> 00:10:46,981
Hey...

120
00:10:47,001 --> 00:10:52,293
Where is the widower? Have you seen
a widower with hair?

121
00:11:00,313 --> 00:11:03,793
Captain! There he is.
- Where is he?

122
00:11:03,794 --> 00:11:07,280
Down there, shall I go get him?
- No, I know my widowers!

123
00:11:07,654 --> 00:11:08,946
Sir!

124
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:12,886
You shouldn't leave a crime scene,
especially when it's your wife.

125
00:11:12,887 --> 00:11:15,388
It's weird.
- It's a shortcut.

126
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:18,527
And where are you going?
- The farm, to feed the horses.

127
00:11:18,528 --> 00:11:21,491
Yeah? Your wife dies, and you
think of horses?

128
00:11:21,824 --> 00:11:25,144
I also think about my seedlings.
- Do you have combines?

129
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,270
How long have you known her, the deceased?

130
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:31,865
Her name was Laetitia. Ten years.

131
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:35,957
We met at a party in Saint-Pessac,
we had a drink.

132
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,886
She slept over at my house
and never left.

133
00:11:38,887 --> 00:11:42,154
What was she doing here?
- She was helping.

134
00:11:42,155 --> 00:11:48,331
She was a farmer's wife.
- How did she help? Cleaning, sweeping,

135
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:50,736
polishing, shopping, cooking, kids,

136
00:11:50,737 --> 00:11:54,557
not paid, not declared, right?
What were you doing this morning?

137
00:11:54,558 --> 00:11:57,582
Where were you?
- On my tractor.

138
00:11:57,905 --> 00:12:01,248
Alone?
- Tractors aren't for passengers.

139
00:12:01,249 --> 00:12:02,793
Yeah? Like coffins

140
00:12:02,794 --> 00:12:04,546
on the merry-go-round of life.

141
00:12:04,547 --> 00:12:07,085
I have a call, excuse me.

142
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:09,634
Yeah Briere? Do you already
have something?

143
00:12:10,398 --> 00:12:13,999
What do you mean nowhere?
Really? Thanks, honey.

144
00:12:14,565 --> 00:12:19,390
So, as I was saying.
Your wife: 0 traces, 0 records.

145
00:12:19,934 --> 00:12:20,955
That's impossible.

146
00:12:23,274 --> 00:12:24,242
Is that her bag?

147
00:12:24,262 --> 00:12:28,009
Yeah, it's not mine.
- Why, are bags gendered?

148
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,772
Blue for boys, pink for girls?

149
00:12:31,012 --> 00:12:33,200
You don't really look

150
00:12:33,201 --> 00:12:35,253
upset by what's happening.

151
00:12:35,293 --> 00:12:37,201
Not answering?

152
00:12:37,703 --> 00:12:41,253
"I say, captain, who else should we
talk to, besides these people?"

153
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:44,850
Back to work. So what's in this bag?

154
00:12:47,993 --> 00:12:49,879
A wallet,

155
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:51,491
money,

156
00:12:51,511 --> 00:12:52,744
business card.

157
00:12:53,014 --> 00:12:53,950
Thppt.

158
00:12:54,048 --> 00:12:55,359
And what is this?

159
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,871
A loyalty card for Pizza Loca!

160
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:02,873
We may have a punch for a free pizza.

161
00:13:03,068 --> 00:13:05,658
Or overcooked pasta.
A Neapolitan crime?

162
00:13:05,669 --> 00:13:08,599
Tell me what you're looking for if
you want me to help.

163
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,948
I don't know. I'm looking!

164
00:13:11,653 --> 00:13:14,193
I'm looking for anything.

165
00:13:14,536 --> 00:13:17,856
Something with your wife's
name on it, a passport,

166
00:13:17,857 --> 00:13:21,984
driving license. Even a national health
card would be fine.

167
00:13:21,985 --> 00:13:23,752
Maybe she had them with her

168
00:13:23,753 --> 00:13:27,092
and they were stolen?
- Not stupid.

169
00:13:27,188 --> 00:13:29,500
Killed by the health card gang.

170
00:13:29,516 --> 00:13:30,852
It's not stupid.

171
00:13:31,149 --> 00:13:34,376
No more stupid than a free pizza.

172
00:13:35,926 --> 00:13:40,049
The fact she's not in your files,
is it a problem?

173
00:13:40,144 --> 00:13:43,746
She didn't do anything wrong.
- The problem is a good citizen

174
00:13:43,747 --> 00:13:45,641
is a registered citizen.

175
00:13:45,642 --> 00:13:50,021
Chinese proverb. Now your wife
is not listed anywhere.

176
00:13:50,335 --> 00:13:52,905
Neither social security number
nor date of birth.

177
00:13:53,196 --> 00:13:57,994
It looks like she never existed.
- I don't know what to tell you.

178
00:13:58,346 --> 00:14:00,011
She was very real.

179
00:14:01,761 --> 00:14:07,363
Um, but come on, I know maybe
where you can look.

180
00:14:07,512 --> 00:14:11,216
I'm wearing you down.

181
00:14:18,113 --> 00:14:19,683
It's over there.

182
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:25,056
What, have you caught the Covid?

183
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:29,925
I'll let you search. It's your job,
not mine.

184
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,818
Do I do all the work?

185
00:14:32,819 --> 00:14:35,861
We don't talk like that to a captain of
the Gendarmerie!

186
00:14:37,756 --> 00:14:38,935
Louise Lemaire.

187
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:42,696
Excuse my son. Respect for rank,
he doesn't know.

188
00:14:44,497 --> 00:14:45,888
Apologize!

189
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:48,639
Don't argue about it, his wife
has just died.

190
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,334
That's not a reason.
- Does she always talk to you like this?

191
00:14:52,335 --> 00:14:55,085
He's my son, I talk to him how I want.

192
00:14:55,086 --> 00:15:00,039
My son, my fight? And to his woman,
how did you talk to her?

193
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,134
Laetitia never caused me no problem.

194
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:06,739
She was a very nice girl, solid!

195
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:09,290
You have to be, to work here.

196
00:15:10,003 --> 00:15:13,144
And to stay that long with my son!

197
00:15:13,347 --> 00:15:16,925
And with you, it was going well
also, I imagine?

198
00:15:17,331 --> 00:15:20,628
What was your son doing
this morning?

199
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:24,427
He was in the fields. He should have

200
00:15:24,428 --> 00:15:28,248
started with the southern plot.
- That doesn't interest the captain.

201
00:15:28,249 --> 00:15:29,976
Yes, it interests me!

202
00:15:29,977 --> 00:15:33,297
I also want to know where you were
this morning, ma'am Louise.

203
00:15:33,298 --> 00:15:35,660
I was making my lunch in the kitchen.

204
00:15:36,349 --> 00:15:40,975
I also went to the vegetable garden to
look for vegetables.

205
00:15:41,494 --> 00:15:42,822
Can they testify?

206
00:15:44,842 --> 00:15:47,068
Who?
- The large local vegetables.

207
00:15:47,526 --> 00:15:49,808
You don't practice soup humor?

208
00:15:49,809 --> 00:15:52,421
Ha ha ha!
No, basically, no.

209
00:15:54,722 --> 00:15:55,913
Hey.

210
00:15:57,674 --> 00:16:02,050
Anyway, life is funny. Your wife
dies in the north

211
00:16:02,059 --> 00:16:05,228
while you were there sowing
little seeds of life.

212
00:16:05,658 --> 00:16:07,436
Does the timing put me at
the scene?

213
00:16:07,437 --> 00:16:08,934
It's not me, it's your mother.

214
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:12,002
Your mother says that normally you
had to sow the seeds

215
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:14,013
in the south of the farm.

216
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:18,331
- What were you doing up north?
- Ouch. - Did you plant settlements?

217
00:16:18,332 --> 00:16:19,279
It hurts?

218
00:16:19,299 --> 00:16:23,423
I took a float from the drain
pump hose.

219
00:16:24,364 --> 00:16:26,700
A float, huh? Show me.

220
00:16:27,503 --> 00:16:31,408
If it will make you happy.
- It's one of the perks of the job.

221
00:16:31,813 --> 00:16:32,977
There.

222
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:38,892
Disgusting! Do you ever
wear deodorant?

223
00:16:38,893 --> 00:16:43,112
When did it happen?
- This morning. Risks of the business.

224
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:46,369
Or the risks of attacking someone
who defends themselves.

225
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:51,622
Like your wife, for example.
- Why would I have killed her?

226
00:16:51,623 --> 00:16:54,025
Exactly, that's what we would
like to know.

227
00:16:54,462 --> 00:16:57,947
To make a bruise like this
takes strength.

228
00:16:57,948 --> 00:17:00,731
And Laetitia was not
a heavyweight.

229
00:17:01,193 --> 00:17:05,157
No need to be strong. We manage
to make babies!

230
00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:08,583
We'll show that to the medical
examiner, OK?

231
00:17:08,685 --> 00:17:10,478
I'm counting on you, Mr. Christophe!

232
00:17:11,424 --> 00:17:12,854
Bye, Louise!

233
00:17:18,388 --> 00:17:20,802
Never do that again!

234
00:17:21,629 --> 00:17:23,778
You didn't tell her anything about Eric,
I hope.

235
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,395
No, what should I have told her?

236
00:17:26,981 --> 00:17:29,942
You really think he came to take
pictures this morning?

237
00:17:30,402 --> 00:17:35,089
He's after our farm! He was
after your wife too!

238
00:17:35,114 --> 00:17:37,114
Open your eyes, you
offal sausage!

239
00:17:39,274 --> 00:17:40,555
Poor kid.

240
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,593
Shame, shame!

241
00:17:48,636 --> 00:17:50,408
We said the 8th.

242
00:17:50,409 --> 00:17:54,078
I can't do anything. What do
I tell my guys?

243
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,499
What's confusing? I didn't say 18.

244
00:18:00,803 --> 00:18:02,138
I'll never be ready, man!

245
00:18:03,267 --> 00:18:04,407
I'll call you back.

246
00:18:05,587 --> 00:18:06,931
What are you doing here?

247
00:18:08,181 --> 00:18:11,258
Wasn't it the farm enough for you?
You wanted Laetitia too!

248
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:13,907
What are you saying?
- I saw you looking at her!

249
00:18:13,908 --> 00:18:18,227
No way, Christophe! I'd never do
that, the family is sacred!

250
00:18:19,362 --> 00:18:22,933
Why are you here talking to me?
- Laetitia is dead, Eric!

251
00:18:22,934 --> 00:18:27,001
It's not true! When?
- This morning, after you left.

252
00:18:27,002 --> 00:18:30,798
Wait, you don't think...
Stop! Christophe!

253
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:34,952
Stop! I have nothing to do with
Laetitia's death!

254
00:18:35,337 --> 00:18:36,551
OK?

255
00:18:43,647 --> 00:18:46,015
Hey, guys!

256
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:51,972
Yeah, Briere?

257
00:18:52,582 --> 00:18:54,629
So, have you found anything on her?

258
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,973
I'm warning you, if you make me
happy I'll adopt you.

259
00:18:57,222 --> 00:19:00,823
<i>It won't be today, I didn't find
anything. And you?</i>

260
00:19:00,988 --> 00:19:04,269
Nothing! No Laetitia Dubus with
the phone carriers.

261
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:07,363
But! Christophe has two subscriptions
in his name!

262
00:19:07,364 --> 00:19:11,262
<i>That doesn't tell us why we can
find no trace of the victim.</i>

263
00:19:11,536 --> 00:19:16,372
She's not a hologram! Anyway, short of
the Holy Spirit, I figured it out.

264
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,966
It smacks of a voluntary disappearance.

265
00:19:20,022 --> 00:19:21,639
A change of identity.

266
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:26,224
Find the list of women who have been
missing for 10 years.

267
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,723
<i>OK, when do you need it?</i>
- Now!

268
00:19:29,724 --> 00:19:32,841
<i>Are you stupid or what?</i> Hello!

269
00:19:33,864 --> 00:19:36,224
By dint of working with you, I've
learned to be in your head.

270
00:19:36,225 --> 00:19:39,584
Be careful, it's contagious.
- I knew what you'd ask:

271
00:19:39,585 --> 00:19:43,545
I've already pulled the cases of
disappearance or death

272
00:19:43,546 --> 00:19:45,155
of women of about 30 years of age.

273
00:19:45,156 --> 00:19:46,935
I'll show you what I found.

274
00:19:48,898 --> 00:19:50,359
"Pauline LeBihan"?

275
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:54,632
It was 10 years ago, near Brive.
Pauline, a researcher

276
00:19:54,633 --> 00:20:00,505
and mother, left her husband and child
like "that" without saying anything.

277
00:20:00,535 --> 00:20:04,372
There was no news for 3 days.
She was found on a bridge.

278
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:07,464
She took the plunge with too long
a rubber band?

279
00:20:07,465 --> 00:20:09,505
She was helped to jump.

280
00:20:10,249 --> 00:20:13,671
A young man on a moped tried
to snatch her bag,

281
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:16,567
Pauline resisted. He pushes
her away, she falls.

282
00:20:16,568 --> 00:20:18,915
Splash!
- Who was the youngster?

283
00:20:18,937 --> 00:20:22,015
A certain Arnaud Naudin, AKA "Nono."

284
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:24,108
Well known to the social services.

285
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:28,529
We quickly caught him, he was
tried and imprisoned.

286
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:31,695
We didn't find the corpse?
- No.

287
00:20:33,056 --> 00:20:37,697
Just a shoe, downstream. To investigators
and her family, she was dead.

288
00:20:37,698 --> 00:20:41,480
Of course, sonny. I'll call the
ex-husband.

289
00:20:41,481 --> 00:20:42,728
To ID the body?

290
00:20:42,729 --> 00:20:45,530
I've already done it. He's meeting
you at the morgue.

291
00:20:45,531 --> 00:20:51,167
You are formidable, you know that?
I'm your friend, Briere!

292
00:21:02,884 --> 00:21:05,431
The court has postponed the hearing?

293
00:21:06,233 --> 00:21:10,735
The Covid can take the blame! It's been
8 months, let him hold this file!

294
00:21:11,907 --> 00:21:13,349
I have to leave you.

295
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,493
15 or 20 minutes.

296
00:21:15,902 --> 00:21:17,035
OK, so long.

297
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:25,308
Mr. LeBihan, Captain Marleau.
Do you know why you here?

298
00:21:25,894 --> 00:21:28,730
You've finally found her?
- Who is that?

299
00:21:28,862 --> 00:21:31,097
Your woman! We don't
know yet.

300
00:21:31,105 --> 00:21:33,425
First, you have to identify the body.

301
00:21:39,088 --> 00:21:42,792
After 10 years, I can't see what
will remain to be identified.

302
00:21:42,793 --> 00:21:46,260
It may be hard. You wanna
have a drink first?

303
00:21:46,261 --> 00:21:49,917
No, I have work waiting for me.
- You sure?

304
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:51,730
As you wish.

305
00:21:52,175 --> 00:21:53,769
"This way, please."

306
00:22:01,979 --> 00:22:03,153
Well?

307
00:22:03,173 --> 00:22:04,720
Yes, it's Pauline.

308
00:22:05,078 --> 00:22:09,665
That's all? Hide your joy.
- I must identify her, no? It's her.

309
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:11,173
"It's her, it's her."

310
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,962
You can see it's not a corpse
from 10 years ago!

311
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:15,654
It's brand new!

312
00:22:15,655 --> 00:22:18,646
In your place-
- You are not in my place.

313
00:22:21,177 --> 00:22:23,154
The wounds there.
She hanged herself?

314
00:22:24,162 --> 00:22:26,002
There? No!

315
00:22:26,003 --> 00:22:28,795
She was killed. The problem is that

316
00:22:28,796 --> 00:22:30,530
we don't know who did it.

317
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,265
What's wrong, sir?

318
00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:38,102
He seems to be thinking.

319
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:43,459
I have so many questions, I don't
know where to start.

320
00:22:43,663 --> 00:22:44,967
From the beginning.

321
00:22:45,357 --> 00:22:47,740
It's good, the beginning.

322
00:22:50,688 --> 00:22:52,665
And there you go!
- A farm.

323
00:22:52,685 --> 00:22:56,060
It doesn't look like Pauline.
- It looks so different

324
00:22:56,061 --> 00:22:58,115
that she was calling herself
"Laetitia DuBus."

325
00:22:58,577 --> 00:22:59,645
It's unbelievable.

326
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:06,056
Why did she leave you 10 years ago?

327
00:23:06,174 --> 00:23:09,720
We never knew.
- How's that, "we"?

328
00:23:10,283 --> 00:23:13,346
Me and my daughter Garance.
She was 8.

329
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:17,783
She pulled herself together,
but it was hard.

330
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,236
"Dad, why did Mum leave?

331
00:23:19,237 --> 00:23:21,269
Dad, why aren't we looking
for her more?"

332
00:23:21,758 --> 00:23:25,025
Then it will be: "Daddy, why did Mom
want us to think she was dead

333
00:23:25,026 --> 00:23:29,047
rather than come home?"
- And especially:

334
00:23:29,048 --> 00:23:31,393
"Daddy, who struck back at mom?"

335
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:34,228
Do you have any idea who
found mum?

336
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:37,830
No? Come, I'll show you something.

337
00:23:40,807 --> 00:23:41,932
There it is.

338
00:23:44,217 --> 00:23:47,335
What are we doing here?
- I'll let you guess.

339
00:23:48,414 --> 00:23:51,795
This is where Pauline was killed.
- Is that so? Have you been here?

340
00:23:51,811 --> 00:23:53,607
No. There are remnants of crime scene tape

341
00:23:53,608 --> 00:23:56,194
on the tree.
- Eye of a sphinx!

342
00:23:56,195 --> 00:23:59,578
I'm a criminal lawyer.
- And not myopic.

343
00:24:01,449 --> 00:24:02,652
Where was the body?

344
00:24:02,728 --> 00:24:07,321
The body, where was it?
I don't like to say bullshit;

345
00:24:07,322 --> 00:24:10,181
The body was where you are!

346
00:24:11,431 --> 00:24:13,275
How am I going to tell my
daughter about this?

347
00:24:13,806 --> 00:24:17,813
Call her. A lawyer knows how to
make pretty speeches, right?

348
00:24:17,814 --> 00:24:19,532
This one will not be beautiful.

349
00:24:19,551 --> 00:24:21,808
I can take care of it.

350
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:25,363
We're used to it at the Gendarmerie,
listening to people cry.

351
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:28,906
Garance, are you there?

352
00:24:30,555 --> 00:24:33,312
Come here, sweetie.
- What is it?

353
00:24:33,727 --> 00:24:35,040
Garance?

354
00:24:35,378 --> 00:24:37,878
Gendarmerie Nationale,
Captain Marleau.

355
00:24:37,879 --> 00:24:42,654
Did I do something forbidden?
- We'll see. It's about your mother.

356
00:24:42,977 --> 00:24:46,438
Elodie? She's not my mother.
- Not that one, the other one.

357
00:24:46,595 --> 00:24:50,322
The true one. How shall I put it?

358
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:54,548
You know in Moliere? "The little
cat, it's dead."

359
00:24:54,767 --> 00:24:58,018
No, it's not that. Do you know Camus?

360
00:24:58,047 --> 00:25:02,805
Have you studied him? Do you know
the first sentence of "The Foreigner"?

361
00:25:04,622 --> 00:25:06,599
"Today, my mother is dead."
- That's it.

362
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,919
We got there.

363
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:13,935
10 years ago, your mother survived
her fall from the bridge.

364
00:25:14,645 --> 00:25:17,098
Instead of coming home, she
invented a new life for herself.

365
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:21,138
A false name, a false background.
- We found her this morning.

366
00:25:21,474 --> 00:25:22,774
Dead.

367
00:25:26,865 --> 00:25:28,545
You knew that she wasn't dead?

368
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:30,542
No! I would have told you!

369
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:35,560
What happened?

370
00:25:35,719 --> 00:25:38,891
Thppt. We don't know. But
this time she's really dead!

371
00:25:38,892 --> 00:25:40,251
Someone killed her.

372
00:25:47,304 --> 00:25:49,515
You are really not delicate.

373
00:25:50,942 --> 00:25:52,809
What did she do all these years?

374
00:25:53,004 --> 00:25:55,510
She lived with a man on a farm,

375
00:25:55,511 --> 00:25:59,834
60 km from here.
- Why didn't she say anything?

376
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:04,074
I'd like to know that. Was it going
well with your father?

377
00:26:04,076 --> 00:26:06,740
Do you suspect him?
- Should I?

378
00:26:07,013 --> 00:26:08,297
No.

379
00:26:08,816 --> 00:26:11,129
No. But I imagine if he discovered
her, he would

380
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:16,320
not have been pleased. Nor I.
- Are you also suspicious?

381
00:26:16,321 --> 00:26:17,852
What did my father say?

382
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,668
In fact, not much.

383
00:26:20,669 --> 00:26:23,692
He gave you his Anguished Father
number?

384
00:26:24,006 --> 00:26:25,326
Don't have any illusions,

385
00:26:25,327 --> 00:26:27,860
it's just to make you do his
dirty work for him.

386
00:26:28,696 --> 00:26:30,500
What a big lie.

387
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:34,534
You can't imagine what he's
been able to achieve

388
00:26:34,822 --> 00:26:37,572
with judges and jurors just
by acting.

389
00:26:37,573 --> 00:26:42,052
No no no, wait a bit before coming
home, you never know.

390
00:26:42,053 --> 00:26:43,709
I said nothing about you and Pauline.

391
00:26:44,249 --> 00:26:47,327
And better keep that to ourselves,
okay?

392
00:26:48,263 --> 00:26:49,407
OK.

393
00:27:02,415 --> 00:27:04,461
Arnaud Naudin, called "Nono."

394
00:27:05,211 --> 00:27:08,055
He did some jail time for the
murder of Pauline LeBihan.

395
00:27:08,258 --> 00:27:10,069
He's been working here for
two weeks.

396
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:12,586
- That's all? - That's all.
- Let's do it.

397
00:27:19,478 --> 00:27:20,731
Hey!

398
00:27:21,815 --> 00:27:23,245
Nono?

399
00:27:25,534 --> 00:27:26,592
Him?

400
00:27:32,674 --> 00:27:37,125
General tour, cut the engines!
Mr. Nono?

401
00:27:37,126 --> 00:27:39,988
I prefer Arnaud.
- You don't like little robots?

402
00:27:39,989 --> 00:27:42,931
No, that was the old me.
Now it's Arnaud.

403
00:27:42,932 --> 00:27:46,969
Okay Mr. Nono For Now,
we have questions.

404
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:49,123
On the new life of Mrs. LeBihan?

405
00:27:49,124 --> 00:27:50,406
How do you know that?

406
00:27:50,629 --> 00:27:54,411
She told me. She came to see me.

407
00:27:54,512 --> 00:27:56,535
You didn't know?
- No.

408
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:08,719
After she fell from the bridge, she was
carried away by the current.

409
00:28:09,335 --> 00:28:13,328
When she woke up, she understood
what fate wanted to tell her.

410
00:28:13,782 --> 00:28:17,110
So she chose to disappear and
start a new life,

411
00:28:17,531 --> 00:28:21,625
somewhere where no one knew
her. But after 10 years-

412
00:28:21,899 --> 00:28:24,008
<i>I don't want to live a lie anymore.</i>

413
00:28:25,281 --> 00:28:28,851
<i>I didn't want you to learn the
truth from someone else.</i>

414
00:28:30,576 --> 00:28:33,242
<i>I promise you, you will be
cleared and compensated.</i>

415
00:28:34,249 --> 00:28:36,999
<i>I just ask that you wait a little longer.</i>

416
00:28:52,557 --> 00:28:55,995
Was it bizarre to see her again?
Alive, and more?

417
00:28:55,999 --> 00:29:01,398
I was relieved and happy. I was
no longer a murderer!

418
00:29:01,399 --> 00:29:05,388
Happy like Ulysses making a long
trip to the slammer,

419
00:29:05,389 --> 00:29:08,015
because of her. Weren't you angry?

420
00:29:08,051 --> 00:29:13,551
Anger, I try to forget. A first
step toward serenity.

421
00:29:14,145 --> 00:29:16,363
Namaste, Nono Rinpoche.

422
00:29:16,374 --> 00:29:18,820
Do you do yoga?
- No, Buddhism

423
00:29:18,821 --> 00:29:21,601
isn't really my thing. I'm just
another man.

424
00:29:22,712 --> 00:29:24,821
Nono would still have ended up
in prison

425
00:29:25,133 --> 00:29:29,108
even without meeting Pauline,
because he was angry.

426
00:29:29,391 --> 00:29:30,462
Angry!

427
00:29:30,463 --> 00:29:32,906
You didn't kill her yesterday morning?
- No, I...

428
00:29:33,713 --> 00:29:36,213
What did you say?
- She's dead!

429
00:29:36,543 --> 00:29:40,066
For good this time. But we don't
know who killed her.

430
00:29:40,067 --> 00:29:43,576
Condemned twice for the murder
of the same woman!

431
00:29:44,328 --> 00:29:45,818
I don't have an alibi for
yesterday morning!

432
00:29:45,819 --> 00:29:50,468
Beautiful in the morning, crow in the
evening; you're really bad luck, you.

433
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,333
Fuck! Mom, what are you doing?

434
00:29:57,506 --> 00:30:02,973
Burning the field!
- Burn the field? You're crazy!

435
00:30:02,974 --> 00:30:09,018
Eric won, our land will be sold.
No one can have it!

436
00:30:09,019 --> 00:30:10,081
Let go of me!

437
00:30:10,082 --> 00:30:12,829
It's not like that, we'll get out of it!

438
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:15,940
What do you want to do?
Beg your cousin?

439
00:30:15,941 --> 00:30:18,091
Sure, he'll listen to you!

440
00:30:18,092 --> 00:30:19,660
I'll see the banker.

441
00:30:19,661 --> 00:30:23,090
He denied you the loan. Will he
make you another one?

442
00:30:23,091 --> 00:30:24,906
I'll find an argument.

443
00:30:24,907 --> 00:30:31,664
An argument? You only have
one: horses.

444
00:30:32,505 --> 00:30:36,748
Horses? I can't, they're Laetitia's.

445
00:30:36,749 --> 00:30:38,686
She's no longer here.

446
00:30:39,303 --> 00:30:42,069
At 16 she can eat without
being watched.

447
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:44,797
She wants to go to school!
- Dear...

448
00:30:46,117 --> 00:30:49,492
You don't have to go to class
with what happened.

449
00:30:49,898 --> 00:30:52,546
I prefer going, to think about
something else.

450
00:30:53,078 --> 00:30:55,312
OK.
- Thank you, Elodie.

451
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,351
See you tonight.
- See you tonight.

452
00:31:53,169 --> 00:31:54,542
Garance, what are you doing?

453
00:32:25,363 --> 00:32:26,371
Woo-hoo!

454
00:32:26,372 --> 00:32:28,753
You're crazy!
- Go slowly!

455
00:32:28,754 --> 00:32:30,300
You'll end up planted!

456
00:32:30,301 --> 00:32:36,386
Do you know Pauline LeBihan?
- No.

457
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:38,725
That's the real name of
your wife.

458
00:32:40,296 --> 00:32:41,510
Come!

459
00:32:41,538 --> 00:32:44,203
Come, I brought croissants and beer!

460
00:32:46,806 --> 00:32:49,142
You never had a flea on your toe?

461
00:32:50,126 --> 00:32:53,478
Laetitia told me she was fed up
with her old life.

462
00:32:53,479 --> 00:32:57,008
I wasn't going to bother her with that.
- No past, no papers,

463
00:32:57,009 --> 00:32:59,735
no Social Security number, no bank account.

464
00:32:59,736 --> 00:33:04,571
You never saw anything?
- I'm not the curious type.

465
00:33:04,572 --> 00:33:09,563
Not curious? To know who they
are: parent, family, friends.

466
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:13,179
I tried to talk to her about it,
it made her uncomfortable.

467
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,641
So I avoided the subject.

468
00:33:15,512 --> 00:33:16,856
Lying to her boyfriend

469
00:33:16,857 --> 00:33:19,426
for 10 years!
- It's not really a lie.

470
00:33:19,465 --> 00:33:20,505
What is it?

471
00:33:20,825 --> 00:33:22,794
A secret. It respects itself.

472
00:33:22,795 --> 00:33:24,148
Otherwise what?

473
00:33:24,905 --> 00:33:27,141
She could have left.
- So you knew

474
00:33:27,142 --> 00:33:32,141
she was hiding something! You were
afraid she would leave.

475
00:33:32,245 --> 00:33:35,580
How long were you afraid?
- From the first second.

476
00:33:36,366 --> 00:33:41,218
A girl like her who falls in love
with a guy like me,

477
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,045
it doesn't happen.

478
00:33:43,046 --> 00:33:44,866
Yes it does, in Beauty and the Beast.

479
00:33:44,867 --> 00:33:48,920
But since then there has been King
Kong Theory. "Thank you, Ste. Virginia!"

480
00:33:50,036 --> 00:33:53,056
What a con! If I had asked her questions
about her past,

481
00:33:53,277 --> 00:33:56,077
she would be gone but-
- She wouldn't be dead.

482
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:59,779
Silence kills: my friend Dom,
when she was young,

483
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,721
she was little was raped by her godfather.

484
00:34:01,728 --> 00:34:05,783
She's been wasting away for 62 years
because her family told her:

485
00:34:05,784 --> 00:34:08,526
"Shut up, Dom. Don't say anything!"

486
00:34:08,775 --> 00:34:10,392
By the way,

487
00:34:11,676 --> 00:34:16,911
the coroner said your thingummy was
due to a metal object.

488
00:34:16,912 --> 00:34:19,148
Yes, my grain pipe.

489
00:34:19,218 --> 00:34:22,231
Yeah, sure.
That's it.

490
00:34:23,254 --> 00:34:25,872
On that matter:

491
00:34:27,536 --> 00:34:28,812
a present!

492
00:34:44,979 --> 00:34:46,158
Guy?

493
00:34:47,696 --> 00:34:49,555
No, no not him, not now!

494
00:34:51,206 --> 00:34:54,567
Guy! We're going to be late
for the match!

495
00:34:55,545 --> 00:34:58,597
Jean-Claude, there is no match today.

496
00:34:58,598 --> 00:35:00,422
Huh?
- And Guy is not here.

497
00:35:00,423 --> 00:35:02,950
We're meeting here!

498
00:35:02,951 --> 00:35:06,636
It's not the right day. There is
no match,

499
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:09,286
and Guy is not here.
I'll take you home.

500
00:35:10,231 --> 00:35:11,305
Let's go!

501
00:35:19,115 --> 00:35:21,294
Magnificent!

502
00:35:21,295 --> 00:35:24,123
You're really magnificent!
- Go cook an egg!

503
00:35:24,124 --> 00:35:25,249
Who's he?

504
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:27,461
Jean-Claude Merle. He lives
in the village.

505
00:35:27,998 --> 00:35:29,874
Do you want to be a model?

506
00:35:29,875 --> 00:35:32,690
I'm not a model to pursue, I'm a cop.

507
00:35:34,769 --> 00:35:36,027
What are you doing here?

508
00:35:36,028 --> 00:35:39,007
I came to see my friend Guy,
but he's not here.

509
00:35:40,188 --> 00:35:41,696
Tell him I came by?

510
00:35:41,697 --> 00:35:43,998
Yes, yes!
He has memory trouble.

511
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:49,169
Goodbye sir.
- There's your bike.

512
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:59,251
Can he go by himself?

513
00:35:59,252 --> 00:36:02,948
Yes, he comes about once a month,
it's always the same.

514
00:36:02,949 --> 00:36:04,252
Fine.
- Yeah.

515
00:36:04,253 --> 00:36:05,916
Who is Guy?

516
00:36:07,678 --> 00:36:09,756
My brother.
- Your brother.

517
00:36:19,228 --> 00:36:22,690
They're beautiful, your vegetables.
You love your land.

518
00:36:22,691 --> 00:36:26,881
Yes. "Your word and the earth
are what is true," that's my motto.

519
00:36:26,882 --> 00:36:28,781
I've always stuck to it.

520
00:36:28,782 --> 00:36:31,462
Not "Your word and the earth
are not to speak"?

521
00:36:31,942 --> 00:36:34,193
Is it the motto of your son too?

522
00:36:34,194 --> 00:36:38,955
Yes, education is like the Earth,
it must be passed down.

523
00:36:39,467 --> 00:36:45,608
But after Christophe all that
will be lost.

524
00:36:46,196 --> 00:36:50,439
Why? He didn't want to have
kids with his wife?

525
00:36:50,894 --> 00:36:52,495
I guess not.

526
00:36:53,548 --> 00:36:56,063
It doesn't look like you
were thrilled.

527
00:36:56,696 --> 00:36:59,845
A woman who doesn't want
children doesn't exist.

528
00:37:00,917 --> 00:37:03,962
Or else Christophe couldn't
convince her.

529
00:37:04,103 --> 00:37:07,166
A woman who doesn't want kids
doesn't exist? What else!

530
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:09,650
What about me? I must stop

531
00:37:09,651 --> 00:37:11,900
and read "The Weekly Patriarchy"!

532
00:37:12,913 --> 00:37:16,629
You and your son are going strong.

533
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:20,788
It takes a lot.
- If he's not happy he can leave!

534
00:37:20,789 --> 00:37:24,124
Maybe he wanted to leave with
his wife, leave the farm

535
00:37:24,125 --> 00:37:28,361
his darling mother holds close
to her heart!

536
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:34,194
Christophe will never leave me alone.

537
00:37:35,112 --> 00:37:39,628
The school called me. Garance
didn't show up this morning.

538
00:37:41,052 --> 00:37:45,722
That's nice of you, thanks. Yes.
I'll keep you informed.

539
00:37:45,723 --> 00:37:47,275
She's not at Baptiste's.

540
00:37:47,751 --> 00:37:50,355
They're not together, his parents say
he was in class.

541
00:37:50,356 --> 00:37:55,458
Shit! She isn't at school or the
hospital, or at her boyfriend's house.

542
00:37:55,459 --> 00:37:58,456
None of her girlfriends know anything.
- Something happened to her.

543
00:37:58,457 --> 00:37:59,714
Listen!

544
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:02,145
She learned her mother lied
to her for 10 years,

545
00:38:02,253 --> 00:38:05,316
yesterday she was murdered. And
like that she disappears.

546
00:38:05,389 --> 00:38:06,881
I'm calling the gendarme.

547
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,189
Well? The banker?

548
00:38:19,279 --> 00:38:23,127
If we sell the horses, that could
be enough for the downpayment.

549
00:38:23,128 --> 00:38:27,486
Anyway, the decision will be
made upstairs.

550
00:38:30,124 --> 00:38:34,041
Another blow for nothing. It's your
cousin who will be happy!

551
00:38:34,109 --> 00:38:36,422
The banker is optimistic.

552
00:38:36,423 --> 00:38:40,530
The banker doesn't care! He is
paid the same every month!

553
00:38:40,531 --> 00:38:42,431
We struggle all the time!

554
00:38:42,728 --> 00:38:44,673
I struggle-
- Sorry?

555
00:38:44,674 --> 00:38:47,458
I'm the one who fought for the loan!

556
00:38:47,516 --> 00:38:50,649
Begging the banker isn't the end
of the world!

557
00:38:50,664 --> 00:38:53,087
I'm not discussing that with you.

558
00:38:53,088 --> 00:38:55,398
You did what you had to do before.

559
00:38:57,634 --> 00:39:00,376
OK, I'm going to take a shower.

560
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:08,411
Thank you for acting so quickly.
- That's public service.

561
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:13,518
Hello madam. Are you the replacement
for Mrs. LeBihan?

562
00:39:13,682 --> 00:39:15,619
Elodie. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

563
00:39:16,229 --> 00:39:18,151
When did your daughter disappear?

564
00:39:18,281 --> 00:39:21,395
She caught her bus at 7:42 am.

565
00:39:21,396 --> 00:39:22,934
Since then, a mystery.

566
00:39:22,935 --> 00:39:26,037
It's the first time she's done this?

567
00:39:26,038 --> 00:39:27,131
Yes. She's a serious girl.

568
00:39:27,132 --> 00:39:30,031
The disappearance and death
of her mother

569
00:39:30,032 --> 00:39:33,785
aren't necessarily linked.
- I wouldn't say that at all.

570
00:39:34,176 --> 00:39:37,184
Where does your daughter sleep?

571
00:39:37,185 --> 00:39:39,243
At the bottom, there.

572
00:39:40,396 --> 00:39:42,985
The door?

573
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:46,758
Nobody.

574
00:39:47,955 --> 00:39:49,150
Wow!

575
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,578
How you doing, Frida Kahlo?

576
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:54,782
"I love you like crazy, like a soldier,

577
00:39:54,783 --> 00:39:56,387
like a movie star."

578
00:39:56,388 --> 00:39:59,850
A song by Laurent Fabius.
Say!

579
00:39:59,851 --> 00:40:01,921
A home Big Brother!

580
00:40:01,922 --> 00:40:03,485
How does this work? What do you
have to press?

581
00:40:03,486 --> 00:40:07,058
You talk to it: "Hello, you!"

582
00:40:07,059 --> 00:40:09,065
Hello you!
- No, to the machine.

583
00:40:09,066 --> 00:40:10,096
Ah?

584
00:40:10,604 --> 00:40:12,128
HELLO, YOU!

585
00:40:12,129 --> 00:40:15,198
<i>Hello, Garance. Do you
have a question?</i>

586
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:17,135
Ha! My name is not Garance.

587
00:40:17,557 --> 00:40:18,682
HELLO, SPEAKER!

588
00:40:18,683 --> 00:40:21,214
Are you pregnant with a beautiful
little robot?

589
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:24,133
<i>The concept of beauty is subjective.</i>

590
00:40:24,134 --> 00:40:28,418
<i>According to Kant, beauty is what
universally pleases.</i>

591
00:40:28,419 --> 00:40:29,631
She's funny!

592
00:40:29,632 --> 00:40:32,597
Can we please come back to my
daughter's disappearance?

593
00:40:32,598 --> 00:40:34,566
It's OK, relax!

594
00:40:35,738 --> 00:40:36,926
HELLO, SPEAKER,

595
00:40:36,927 --> 00:40:39,217
DID MR. JONATHAN HERE KNOW

596
00:40:39,218 --> 00:40:41,601
THAT HIS WIFE, not you, ma'am,

597
00:40:41,602 --> 00:40:42,656
LED A DOUBLE LIFE?

598
00:40:42,657 --> 00:40:45,578
<i>I do not understand the question.</i>

599
00:40:45,579 --> 00:40:48,655
Me neither, I don't understand.
- Yes!

600
00:40:48,703 --> 00:40:52,180
I questioned the first killer of your wife.

601
00:40:52,181 --> 00:40:53,765
not you, madam.

602
00:40:53,766 --> 00:40:56,998
His name is Mr. Nono, like "little robot."

603
00:40:56,999 --> 00:41:00,468
It seems your ex-wife revealed herself
to him first.

604
00:41:00,469 --> 00:41:03,164
It was expected she would then
see you two.

605
00:41:03,499 --> 00:41:06,952
In any case, she didn't come see me.
- Me neither.

606
00:41:06,992 --> 00:41:10,055
Back on topic, in that case.

607
00:41:10,312 --> 00:41:12,484
HELLO SPEAKER!

608
00:41:12,925 --> 00:41:15,612
WHY DID GARANCE LEAVE HOME?

609
00:41:15,811 --> 00:41:18,851
<i>I do not understand the question.</i>

610
00:41:18,852 --> 00:41:22,714
You never understand anything!
This thing is useless.

611
00:41:22,715 --> 00:41:25,221
So are you! That's crazy!

612
00:41:25,222 --> 00:41:28,566
My daughter is in danger and
you play with a box!

613
00:41:29,222 --> 00:41:30,644
Hello, Speaker?

614
00:41:31,295 --> 00:41:34,842
What is Garance's recent internet
search history?

615
00:41:36,373 --> 00:41:37,748
There. Behind you.

616
00:41:38,828 --> 00:41:40,819
FARMHOUSE MURDER
- Where's that?

617
00:41:40,839 --> 00:41:43,452
Where Pauline lived for 10 years.

618
00:41:43,453 --> 00:41:45,149
And where her murderer lives.

619
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:47,609
Maybe. Or maybe not.

620
00:42:29,999 --> 00:42:33,741
You-are you Laetitia's daughter?

621
00:42:33,921 --> 00:42:35,577
She was called that?

622
00:42:37,234 --> 00:42:38,417
Yes.

623
00:42:46,838 --> 00:42:49,411
Your parents at least know
where you are?

624
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:51,341
Yes, yes it's good.

625
00:42:52,895 --> 00:42:55,075
Laetitia also lied very badly.

626
00:42:55,324 --> 00:42:57,543
Says the guy who got fooled
for 10 years.

627
00:42:58,329 --> 00:42:59,438
That's true.

628
00:42:59,439 --> 00:43:01,820
You have the same sense of repartee
as your mother.

629
00:43:01,821 --> 00:43:04,782
I'm not my mother, OK? I have nothing
to do with her.

630
00:43:05,103 --> 00:43:07,470
Don't say that.
- Yes, she was a monster.

631
00:43:07,471 --> 00:43:12,470
She abandoned her husband, her daughter;
what kind of mother does that?

632
00:43:12,471 --> 00:43:16,627
I don't know. You know mine is
still around, so...

633
00:43:20,421 --> 00:43:22,187
Do you know this was her horse?

634
00:43:22,188 --> 00:43:23,429
"Diabolo."

635
00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:58,573
All right?

636
00:44:00,414 --> 00:44:01,586
Listen,

637
00:44:02,601 --> 00:44:05,464
you have a perfect right to be angry
with your mother.

638
00:44:05,465 --> 00:44:08,202
I would be too in your place.

639
00:44:08,232 --> 00:44:10,386
And you, you don't blame her?

640
00:44:10,387 --> 00:44:14,121
Yes, yes, but I tell myself she didn't
lie in order to hurt me.

641
00:44:15,549 --> 00:44:19,549
We can all be pushed to do something
wrong one day.

642
00:44:19,973 --> 00:44:23,650
Depending on context.
- We have to forgive everything?

643
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:28,366
Not necessarily. Trying to
understand is good.

644
00:44:55,133 --> 00:44:57,977
He's with her, the bastard!
- Yes, I'm taking care of it.

645
00:44:57,978 --> 00:44:59,231
HEY!

646
00:44:59,672 --> 00:45:00,999
For god sake.
- Dad!

647
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,352
Are you OK?
- Yes, fine.

648
00:45:03,353 --> 00:45:05,079
You disappeared.

649
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,797
Why did you leave like that?

650
00:45:07,289 --> 00:45:09,789
You took a big risk.
- What risk?

651
00:45:10,663 --> 00:45:11,858
It's not a safe place.

652
00:45:11,859 --> 00:45:15,080
What isn't a safe place? Huh?

653
00:45:15,081 --> 00:45:18,938
There's a killer on the loose around here.

654
00:45:18,939 --> 00:45:21,917
Go for it, say I killed Laetitia.

655
00:45:21,918 --> 00:45:24,627
That's what I just said, you're too
slow to understand.

656
00:45:24,628 --> 00:45:28,229
I think your wife liked other talents.

657
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:29,659
You're referring to me?

658
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:34,285
It's hard to admit she'd rather
live with a louse

659
00:45:34,286 --> 00:45:35,708
than with you!

660
00:45:35,709 --> 00:45:38,754
The louse is going to jail.
- Are you going to fight?

661
00:45:39,123 --> 00:45:42,631
What will that prove? Mom's dead!

662
00:45:42,632 --> 00:45:44,324
She won't go home with the winner

663
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:45,934
of your pissing match!

664
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:48,981
Thppt!

665
00:45:49,001 --> 00:45:52,656
QED, I wouldn't have said it better.
A good head on that kid.

666
00:45:53,224 --> 00:45:56,365
Hey presumption-of-innocence,
know a lawyer?

667
00:45:56,499 --> 00:45:59,828
You, we need to talk, come. Him too,
I'll question him:

668
00:45:59,843 --> 00:46:01,320
Yeah, you. Anyway,

669
00:46:01,639 --> 00:46:04,101
what exactly were you doing that day

670
00:46:04,102 --> 00:46:06,764
with her on your back, I'd like to know.

671
00:46:07,048 --> 00:46:08,571
What else is there?

672
00:46:08,936 --> 00:46:12,335
Your wife had trunks full of secrets.

673
00:46:12,914 --> 00:46:16,523
She said nothing to me.
- She told Nono,

674
00:46:16,541 --> 00:46:19,588
Nono was the guy who was with her
the first time she died.

675
00:46:19,847 --> 00:46:21,503
She found him?

676
00:46:21,955 --> 00:46:23,752
What would you have done if you knew

677
00:46:23,753 --> 00:46:25,760
she was going to disclose her secret?

678
00:46:26,173 --> 00:46:29,394
That secret was the glue of
your relationship.

679
00:46:29,395 --> 00:46:32,596
No more secrets, no more couple
or kissy-kissy.

680
00:46:32,597 --> 00:46:34,738
Killing her wouldn't have solved
the problem.

681
00:46:35,497 --> 00:46:38,709
The problem is every 3 days a guy
kills his wife who says

682
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:41,893
he prefers seeing her dead
than not having her all to himself.

683
00:46:49,531 --> 00:46:51,406
"Hello" Briere.
- Captain.

684
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:53,260
Come closer.

685
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,432
Are you afraid of a horse?
He's your replacement!

686
00:46:56,955 --> 00:46:59,885
Can I talk to you?
- Yes. You've got him?

687
00:47:00,103 --> 00:47:02,196
What is it?
- Here;

688
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:05,946
the call history of Christophe Lemaire.

689
00:47:06,088 --> 00:47:10,595
Yes, and?
- This is the phone the victim was using.

690
00:47:10,704 --> 00:47:11,713
Oh?

691
00:47:11,733 --> 00:47:13,981
- And that number.
- Yes?

692
00:47:14,208 --> 00:47:15,982
Do you know whose it is?

693
00:47:16,231 --> 00:47:17,768
No, but you're going to tell me.

694
00:47:17,769 --> 00:47:20,284
Yes, it's Elodie Merchant's.

695
00:47:20,285 --> 00:47:21,416
Merchant of what?

696
00:47:21,417 --> 00:47:26,136
Elodie, the new companion of
Jonathan LeBihan.

697
00:47:27,348 --> 00:47:30,753
You know what? You're the child
I'll never have, Briere.

698
00:47:39,515 --> 00:47:40,655
Captain.

699
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:45,866
Captain, why have you summoned me?
- Sit down, I'll show you.

700
00:47:46,418 --> 00:47:49,966
Look. Phone bills of Madam Laetitia.

701
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:51,256
Formerly Madam Pauline.

702
00:47:51,257 --> 00:47:55,380
All calls she made and received.
And look, in yellow:

703
00:47:55,381 --> 00:47:56,912
your number!

704
00:47:56,913 --> 00:47:58,826
Since when did you know she wasn't dead?

705
00:47:58,827 --> 00:48:01,045
A year.
- You failed to tell us.

706
00:48:01,046 --> 00:48:05,886
Really? Ex-best friend, Jonathan's
new wife,

707
00:48:06,066 --> 00:48:09,771
the only one who knows Pauline's
secret: the ideal suspect!

708
00:48:09,772 --> 00:48:12,730
That calculation then
saying nothing is worse.

709
00:48:12,731 --> 00:48:14,043
I didn't kill Pauline!

710
00:48:14,044 --> 00:48:16,212
Don't yell at me! It's not my fault!

711
00:48:18,251 --> 00:48:19,993
How did you know she wasn't dead?

712
00:48:19,994 --> 00:48:23,140
From her, she came to see me.

713
00:48:24,718 --> 00:48:27,484
<i>No, you got married?</i>

714
00:48:27,897 --> 00:48:30,069
<i>Yes, for 3 years.</i>

715
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:32,456
<i>Who's the lucky guy?</i>

716
00:48:32,457 --> 00:48:33,512
<i>Do I know him?</i>

717
00:48:35,081 --> 00:48:36,198
<i>It's Jonathan.</i>

718
00:48:37,922 --> 00:48:38,992
<i>After your death-</i>

719
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,406
<i>well, your disappearance-we got closer.</i>

720
00:48:43,303 --> 00:48:46,530
<i>He needed someone and I was there.</i>

721
00:48:46,877 --> 00:48:50,503
<i>Thanks for your honesty. I knew.</i>

722
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:53,591
<i>Is that so? How?</i>

723
00:48:53,943 --> 00:48:56,302
<i>I live on a farm, but I have internet.</i>

724
00:48:58,101 --> 00:48:59,382
<i>Listen,</i>

725
00:49:00,258 --> 00:49:01,946
<i>since we're saying things,</i>

726
00:49:02,533 --> 00:49:04,384
<i>can I ask a question?</i>

727
00:49:05,441 --> 00:49:07,253
<i>Why did you leave 10 years ago?</i>

728
00:49:08,302 --> 00:49:10,677
<i>Because of your job? Because
of Jonathan?</i>

729
00:49:11,611 --> 00:49:12,923
<i>No no because of me.</i>

730
00:49:13,548 --> 00:49:14,603
Pauline confessed to me

731
00:49:14,604 --> 00:49:16,940
that she suffered from absence of
maternal instinct.

732
00:49:17,583 --> 00:49:21,232
She was unable to experience love
for her own daughter,

733
00:49:21,977 --> 00:49:23,367
like a normal mother.

734
00:49:24,985 --> 00:49:28,970
She saw herself as a heartless monster,
and it gnawed at her.

735
00:49:29,657 --> 00:49:32,868
One day she broke down and left
without saying a word.

736
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,851
"Maternal instinct," that's bullshit.

737
00:49:36,852 --> 00:49:40,730
Your friend left her man, and
she said to herself:

738
00:49:40,731 --> 00:49:43,437
"He's going to find someone better
to raise our daughter."

739
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:47,945
Lots of guys do that, right?
- I don't know.

740
00:49:48,114 --> 00:49:50,068
This is what she was hoping for.

741
00:49:50,069 --> 00:49:51,991
<i>I hid for 3 days.</i>

742
00:49:52,067 --> 00:49:53,731
<i>Without sleeping or eating.</i>

743
00:49:55,016 --> 00:49:58,000
<i>I didn't know if I was going to do
the right thing or not.</i>

744
00:49:59,311 --> 00:50:00,952
<i>I came to a bridge.</i>

745
00:50:01,722 --> 00:50:05,215
<i>And there in front of the sunrise,
I asked myself:</i>

746
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:09,811
<i>go home, or go for good?</i>

747
00:50:12,888 --> 00:50:14,693
<i>Finally, someone decided for me.</i>

748
00:50:14,694 --> 00:50:19,575
She didn't call you to compare
wedding dresses?

749
00:50:19,577 --> 00:50:22,764
No. At first it was to fill a void.

750
00:50:23,266 --> 00:50:25,961
She was happy, but something
was missing.

751
00:50:25,962 --> 00:50:29,084
What? A friend to confide in?

752
00:50:29,085 --> 00:50:32,437
Because she phoned you a week
before dying.

753
00:50:32,438 --> 00:50:35,524
Yes, she wanted to see me.
It sounded urgent.

754
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:38,849
<i>You thought about it a lot, what
does that imply?</i>

755
00:50:39,618 --> 00:50:41,610
<i>It's been a month that I've
thought about it.</i>

756
00:50:42,722 --> 00:50:47,243
<i>Garance will be in shock.
- Yes, but it must be done.</i>

757
00:50:48,609 --> 00:50:53,178
<i>Why now?
- It's complicated, I have my reasons.</i>

758
00:50:53,188 --> 00:50:56,774
<i>No, you can't leave me like that
without telling me more.</i>

759
00:50:57,570 --> 00:51:01,484
<i>It regards Christophe. I learned
some things about him.</i>

760
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:03,180
<i>There are things that need to change.</i>

761
00:51:03,554 --> 00:51:06,913
<i>What needs to change? Are you
going to leave him?</i>

762
00:51:07,315 --> 00:51:09,050
<i>Pauline, answer me.</i>

763
00:51:09,711 --> 00:51:12,164
<i>If you want Jonathan back,
I won't let you do it.</i>

764
00:51:12,367 --> 00:51:15,781
<i>No. I promise you, you know.
- What then?</i>

765
00:51:17,803 --> 00:51:19,389
<i>I can't tell you.</i>

766
00:51:20,594 --> 00:51:22,453
<i>It concerns a man's death.</i>

767
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:24,622
A man's death? Who was it?

768
00:51:24,625 --> 00:51:26,586
She didn't tell me.

769
00:51:26,733 --> 00:51:29,624
After she saw your husband,
Mr. Jonathan?

770
00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:33,277
She planned to.
- When?

771
00:51:34,161 --> 00:51:35,430
WHEN?

772
00:51:36,164 --> 00:51:37,446
Okay:

773
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:39,966
the day she got done in.

774
00:51:40,952 --> 00:51:42,710
Guys.

775
00:51:42,889 --> 00:51:45,624
Is he here, the lawyer?
- Yes, in your office.

776
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:51,067
And he's not happy. He said he's
the victim of police harassment.

777
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:55,009
I don't care. Good lawyers always
cook things up better.

778
00:51:58,741 --> 00:51:59,803
She's coming.

779
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:03,918
What the whorehouse is this?
Where's my wife?

780
00:52:03,945 --> 00:52:06,586
Why is she here?
- Hello, <i>maitre.</i>

781
00:52:06,587 --> 00:52:09,719
A whorehouse is a place of work,

782
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:13,146
but your wife isn't here for
a job interview,

783
00:52:13,147 --> 00:52:18,383
rather for a free hearing: we suspect
her in Pauline's death.

784
00:52:18,384 --> 00:52:21,874
What? Nobody knew she was
still alive!

785
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:24,508
Is that so? You astonish me. Listen.

786
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:28,177
<i>All calls she made and received.
And look, in yellow:</i>

787
00:52:28,236 --> 00:52:31,424
<i>your number! Since when did you
know she wasn't dead?</i>

788
00:52:31,425 --> 00:52:33,527
<i>A year.
- You failed to tell us.</i>

789
00:52:33,528 --> 00:52:36,901
We don't record people who are
in court, only those in custody.

790
00:52:37,364 --> 00:52:40,692
I want to be her lawyer.
- We'll see about that later.

791
00:52:40,693 --> 00:52:44,274
There, I'm taking a break.
- Where are you going?

792
00:52:44,275 --> 00:52:47,456
2 hours of hearings so far! Briere!

793
00:52:47,457 --> 00:52:48,813
I'm going to the cafe across the way.

794
00:52:49,148 --> 00:52:52,859
3, 2, 1... enter the lawyer.

795
00:52:58,383 --> 00:53:01,477
What are you playing at?
- Something foamy, <i>maitre</i>?

796
00:53:01,794 --> 00:53:02,974
Not thirsty.

797
00:53:02,994 --> 00:53:07,028
You're right, better to be sober when
preparing your defense.

798
00:53:07,029 --> 00:53:10,250
Especially when suspected of murder.

799
00:53:10,251 --> 00:53:13,783
Me too, I'm a suspect?
- Long suspense:

800
00:53:14,638 --> 00:53:19,787
Your living wife says your dead wife
wanted to see you again.

801
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:24,847
If she did, you saw her again
and you went crazy,

802
00:53:24,848 --> 00:53:27,296
like "that", like with Mr. Christophe.

803
00:53:27,297 --> 00:53:29,576
You have nothing.
- No.

804
00:53:30,303 --> 00:53:37,125
"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you
have nothing on my client here present.

805
00:53:37,666 --> 00:53:40,574
He had no reason to kill his wife!

806
00:53:40,575 --> 00:53:43,524
She left him, she passed herself off
as dead.

807
00:53:44,164 --> 00:53:47,242
For 10 years she left him alone

808
00:53:47,764 --> 00:53:50,803
to raise their poor little 7-year-old girl,

809
00:53:50,818 --> 00:53:55,389
while she lay in the arms of
a toothless farmer-"

810
00:53:55,390 --> 00:53:58,367
What do you say? Crickets?
Shall I continue?

811
00:53:59,542 --> 00:54:02,105
I could never have killed her.
- No.

812
00:54:02,412 --> 00:54:05,615
"He could never have killed
this woman,

813
00:54:05,756 --> 00:54:10,428
this liar, this usurper, this
unworthy mother!

814
00:54:10,446 --> 00:54:14,118
In short, this woman.
'And why, ' you ask me?"

815
00:54:14,354 --> 00:54:15,791
Yes: why, sir?

816
00:54:18,108 --> 00:54:19,437
Because I still loved her.

817
00:54:20,528 --> 00:54:22,679
I've been trying 10 years to forget her.

818
00:54:23,195 --> 00:54:24,649
She's always there.

819
00:54:26,008 --> 00:54:29,226
Guys who kill their wives on
the pretext that they love them:

820
00:54:29,227 --> 00:54:31,902
there are many.
- I know.

821
00:54:33,698 --> 00:54:36,011
Even defended some, people like that.

822
00:54:36,399 --> 00:54:38,539
It's not the most brilliant thing you did.

823
00:54:50,327 --> 00:54:52,125
Mr. Christophe!

824
00:54:52,126 --> 00:54:54,328
Celebrating your wife's funeral?

825
00:54:55,972 --> 00:54:59,167
The bank approved my loan. I can make
an offer to Eric.

826
00:55:01,003 --> 00:55:05,893
Why did they change their mind?
- My contribution. I'm selling the horses.

827
00:55:06,085 --> 00:55:09,984
They're worth a lot?
- Some, yes. Diabolo, especially.

828
00:55:09,985 --> 00:55:14,887
It was good, your wife's death.
- Think what you want,

829
00:55:14,888 --> 00:55:16,923
I don't care. What do you want?

830
00:55:16,924 --> 00:55:19,280
You're boring. A year ago,

831
00:55:19,281 --> 00:55:21,488
your wife saw her former friend again.

832
00:55:21,503 --> 00:55:25,631
You knew that? No, you never
know anything.

833
00:55:25,632 --> 00:55:30,278
If you know my answers,
you don't need me.

834
00:55:30,662 --> 00:55:32,693
Pfft! You've got a short fuse!

835
00:55:43,059 --> 00:55:48,661
Hey Christophe! Your woman, when
she spoke to her friend,

836
00:55:48,662 --> 00:55:53,422
she also said she had learned
something about you.

837
00:55:53,423 --> 00:55:55,114
What I mean to say, or not, is:

838
00:55:55,356 --> 00:55:57,051
how do you figure that

839
00:55:57,052 --> 00:56:01,297
right after saying this, she dies?
Coincidence?

840
00:56:01,673 --> 00:56:05,173
At the Gendarmerie, we have the
Big Golden Book of Coincidences.

841
00:56:05,174 --> 00:56:07,541
Come with me to autograph it.

842
00:56:07,542 --> 00:56:13,901
YOU THERE! No one's going anywhere!
What does this one think,

843
00:56:14,113 --> 00:56:16,300
that she's taking my son in?

844
00:56:16,301 --> 00:56:20,261
Respect for the uniform?
- Put that down, mom.

845
00:56:20,262 --> 00:56:24,981
She knows about Guy's death.
- So what?

846
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:28,516
Why would she believe us?
- We'll explain it to her.

847
00:56:28,542 --> 00:56:29,698
It was an accident.

848
00:56:29,718 --> 00:56:32,312
Give him the pitchfork,
it might be loaded.

849
00:56:33,643 --> 00:56:36,096
If even my son is against me-

850
00:56:40,774 --> 00:56:43,961
Stop being paranoid,

851
00:56:43,962 --> 00:56:46,110
Come and have a fireside chat, huh?

852
00:56:47,117 --> 00:56:49,516
Your son can come in on his own,
he's a big boy.

853
00:56:56,287 --> 00:57:01,217
We all have our demons. My brother's
was alcohol.

854
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:04,831
One evening I saw him come back,

855
00:57:06,482 --> 00:57:08,419
he had his belt in his hand.

856
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:12,624
That time he went after Eric.

857
00:57:13,392 --> 00:57:16,454
And you said nothing? Beautiful family.

858
00:57:16,507 --> 00:57:19,281
That night, Eric wasn't there.

859
00:57:20,466 --> 00:57:22,560
Only Christophe.

860
00:57:23,221 --> 00:57:28,712
And I told him! So he said

861
00:57:28,971 --> 00:57:32,213
"I'll make do with what I have,
with what I find."

862
00:57:35,194 --> 00:57:38,101
So I jumped on him!
- Mom...

863
00:57:39,031 --> 00:57:40,640
I was 7 years old.

864
00:57:41,742 --> 00:57:45,398
I came out of my room, I saw my
uncle wasn't moving.

865
00:57:46,518 --> 00:57:49,555
I realized his head had hit the floor:

866
00:57:50,124 --> 00:57:52,592
whiplash.
- That's hot.

867
00:57:53,304 --> 00:57:54,471
Then?

868
00:57:54,918 --> 00:57:59,708
Then I panicked. My mom, responsible
for my dead uncle,

869
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:02,348
I saw myself ending my life in care.

870
00:58:03,294 --> 00:58:05,653
But mom told me to grab Guy's feet.

871
00:58:05,904 --> 00:58:08,115
That's not a mother, she's a witch!

872
00:58:08,116 --> 00:58:09,811
Is it Salem here?

873
00:58:10,419 --> 00:58:12,951
You pretended it was an accident?

874
00:58:12,952 --> 00:58:15,155
A serious fall.

875
00:58:15,156 --> 00:58:17,328
And since he was drunk, that sold it.

876
00:58:17,348 --> 00:58:20,594
You're Machiavellian!
- And after,

877
00:58:20,959 --> 00:58:24,459
we promised to take this secret
to our graves.

878
00:58:24,475 --> 00:58:26,122
"My word, the earth!"

879
00:58:26,123 --> 00:58:30,928
Yes, except I broke my promise.

880
00:58:31,576 --> 00:58:36,873
I told Laetitia about it. Captain,
about the pitchfork:

881
00:58:36,999 --> 00:58:38,570
you're not going to file a complaint?

882
00:58:38,619 --> 00:58:40,753
If I filed a complaint against everyone
who can't stand me,

883
00:58:40,754 --> 00:58:42,780
we could do a TV series.

884
00:58:43,275 --> 00:58:46,025
Good! We're going to draft a statement

885
00:58:46,047 --> 00:58:47,641
about your piece-of-work uncle.

886
00:58:47,642 --> 00:58:48,921
It was an accident,

887
00:58:48,922 --> 00:58:51,803
There's mitigation!
- Registering for an insurance check?

888
00:58:51,804 --> 00:58:53,622
What's your damage?

889
00:58:53,623 --> 00:58:57,647
Don't make fun!
Move: in the car, Louise!

890
00:58:57,648 --> 00:58:58,950
"This way."

891
00:59:14,375 --> 00:59:18,289
Captain, will you bring her back?
- Do you see "Uber Gendarme" anywhere?

892
00:59:18,531 --> 00:59:20,735
Don't make fun. By the way-

893
00:59:20,736 --> 00:59:24,150
how did your wife react when
you told her?

894
00:59:25,165 --> 00:59:28,337
I told her I had to speak, to free
myself from the weight.

895
00:59:28,564 --> 00:59:32,236
A bit like her. Can't always
clear your history!

896
00:59:32,237 --> 00:59:35,089
Come on, hot stuff.

897
00:59:52,907 --> 00:59:55,673
Captain.
- Thank you, my dear.

898
00:59:58,983 --> 01:00:00,920
Here we are!

899
01:00:01,961 --> 01:00:03,914
A beautiful, brand new statement!

900
01:00:03,951 --> 01:00:08,951
You read it, then you sign it.

901
01:00:14,401 --> 01:00:15,994
However:

902
01:00:16,857 --> 01:00:20,972
this one is not brand new. 1980.

903
01:00:21,207 --> 01:00:23,325
I struggled to get it, but it
was worth it

904
01:00:23,326 --> 01:00:26,306
because I have a lot of stuff in it:

905
01:00:26,307 --> 01:00:30,362
especially that someone said your
brother is dead

906
01:00:30,363 --> 01:00:34,384
because of a quarrel with you.
"Guy was my friend,

907
01:00:34,385 --> 01:00:37,300
it's that slut Louise who did it."

908
01:00:37,301 --> 01:00:38,990
Who is this witness?

909
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:42,717
Jean-Claude?

910
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:45,208
Yes. It doesn't surprise me
that it was him.

911
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:48,719
He could never blame me.
It was mutual.

912
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:52,758
What he said wasn't true?
- It's bullshit!

913
01:00:53,310 --> 01:00:57,707
Bullshit! I never had a problem
with my brother. Besides-

914
01:00:58,553 --> 01:01:01,305
And he would surely still be

915
01:01:01,306 --> 01:01:06,795
alive, if what happened
hadn't happened.

916
01:01:08,378 --> 01:01:11,792
I'm done with the mother. Can you
take her back to her son?

917
01:01:11,864 --> 01:01:15,029
Is she confident, or do you plan
to marleauter it?

918
01:01:15,267 --> 01:01:18,236
"Marleauter"? Don't say bad words.

919
01:01:18,237 --> 01:01:21,278
No, you give people some leeway,

920
01:01:21,467 --> 01:01:22,981
You make her believe she's home free,

921
01:01:22,982 --> 01:01:24,654
and when she least expects it: squawk!

922
01:01:24,944 --> 01:01:28,616
I'm not as smart as I look.
In any event,

923
01:01:29,098 --> 01:01:31,481
I would never do that to a helpless woman,

924
01:01:31,482 --> 01:01:34,571
even if she doesn't tell us everything...
the naughty!

925
01:01:48,729 --> 01:01:50,354
Mom?

926
01:01:51,176 --> 01:01:53,719
Well? Is it all good?

927
01:01:54,830 --> 01:01:57,158
What is it? It doesn't seem to be.

928
01:01:58,383 --> 01:02:00,531
Are you seriously asking me?

929
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,823
This story, it was between us.

930
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:07,378
Why did you need to tell Laetitia?

931
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:11,256
Have you seen the mess?
- What mess?

932
01:02:11,662 --> 01:02:13,818
It's been eating at us for 40 years.

933
01:02:14,475 --> 01:02:16,046
Don't you feel relieved?

934
01:02:16,047 --> 01:02:17,450
Relieved of what?

935
01:02:18,497 --> 01:02:21,262
Now everyone one will know.
- Will know what?

936
01:02:21,628 --> 01:02:25,808
That you accidentally killed your brother
trying to protect your son?

937
01:02:27,238 --> 01:02:28,429
Mom?

938
01:02:29,778 --> 01:02:31,434
Answer me!

939
01:02:31,435 --> 01:02:33,620
Don't use that tone when you
talk to your mother!

940
01:02:33,621 --> 01:02:35,861
ANSWER ME!
- But...

941
01:02:37,538 --> 01:02:38,835
This is finished!

942
01:02:39,726 --> 01:02:40,890
FINISHED!

943
01:03:00,550 --> 01:03:02,027
The farm is divided into thirds.

944
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:04,393
I want to sell, my cousin too,

945
01:03:04,394 --> 01:03:09,085
but not Christophe. But he doesn't
have enough to buy back our shares.

946
01:03:09,086 --> 01:03:13,645
Hey, really tight, the cousins.
- You said it, not me.

947
01:03:13,646 --> 01:03:17,094
As it dragged on, we took
the case to court.

948
01:03:17,414 --> 01:03:20,742
"We"? Strange your cousin didn't
tell me about it.

949
01:03:20,743 --> 01:03:25,536
He's ashamed. For people like
him and his mother,

950
01:03:25,537 --> 01:03:28,037
losing their land is worse than anything.

951
01:03:28,038 --> 01:03:30,206
Worse than losing his wife?

952
01:03:30,207 --> 01:03:34,063
Honestly? For them, I think it's equal.

953
01:03:34,064 --> 01:03:37,134
Honestly, it's none of my business,

954
01:03:37,296 --> 01:03:42,711
but a courtroom is not great for
a family reunion.

955
01:03:43,296 --> 01:03:46,859
I don't know. Ask Christophe to
find out what she thinks about it.

956
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:53,149
And his wife Laetitia, did you
know her well?

957
01:03:53,641 --> 01:03:54,703
Laetitia?

958
01:03:56,594 --> 01:03:58,539
No, not so much.

959
01:03:58,615 --> 01:04:02,428
Not so much? You never spent Christmas Eve,

960
01:04:02,429 --> 01:04:04,916
New Year with her?
- If necessary, a little.

961
01:04:04,917 --> 01:04:08,830
- But we weren't really talking to
each other. -

962
01:04:08,850 --> 01:04:11,623
She was a very discreet person.

963
01:04:12,121 --> 01:04:15,309
Well, I also say that, but super
discreetly.

964
01:04:15,495 --> 01:04:18,339
You look tense. I'm a naturopathic
gendarme,

965
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:21,218
I'll take your blood pressure.

966
01:04:21,741 --> 01:04:25,390
Ho, what are you doing?
- I'm zealous.

967
01:04:25,846 --> 01:04:27,682
Open Sesame!

968
01:04:28,779 --> 01:04:31,763
What did I do?
- Welcome home, sir!

969
01:04:32,364 --> 01:04:33,664
Go on.

970
01:04:36,156 --> 01:04:38,680
Shouldn't try to smoke me out.
I'm susceptible,

971
01:04:38,681 --> 01:04:39,922
it upset me.

972
01:04:39,923 --> 01:04:44,761
When your cousin came
to rearrange your face,

973
01:04:44,777 --> 01:04:47,769
one of your employees did
the <i>dix-cette.</i>

974
01:04:48,206 --> 01:04:50,870
Your cousin suspects you of
killing his wife?

975
01:04:50,871 --> 01:04:53,282
It's his thing.
- Yeah?

976
01:04:53,570 --> 01:04:56,406
That's crazy too. What's this?

977
01:04:57,283 --> 01:04:58,533
It's my card.

978
01:05:00,181 --> 01:05:01,501
I give them out occasionally.

979
01:05:01,502 --> 01:05:04,729
And on occasion, she put it on her
little heart, in her bag,

980
01:05:04,730 --> 01:05:10,256
to do emergency work.
- Fine. OK, she called me 6 days ago,

981
01:05:10,257 --> 01:05:11,561
to see each other.

982
01:05:11,570 --> 01:05:14,082
So what? You look disappointed.

983
01:05:16,066 --> 01:05:18,581
When my phone rang and I saw
her name, yes,

984
01:05:19,421 --> 01:05:20,968
I didn't care about those things.

985
01:05:20,969 --> 01:05:25,185
But she wanted to postpone
the court date.

986
01:05:25,186 --> 01:05:28,218
And what were her "arguments," 43D?

987
01:05:28,219 --> 01:05:31,595
No. She wanted time to do
geological studies.

988
01:05:32,604 --> 01:05:35,108
It's brave, at her age, to take up
studying Geography.

989
01:05:35,109 --> 01:05:40,000
No: geological. She wanted to
analyze the soil.

990
01:05:41,462 --> 01:05:44,751
The farm land could be worth more
than expected.

991
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,184
That's good! You weren't tickled?

992
01:05:47,185 --> 01:05:50,021
No, it felt like just an
excuse to delay the sale,

993
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:53,853
the drilling, the experts, the
opposing experts.

994
01:05:53,854 --> 01:05:57,144
- So what?
- If it brings you a big nest egg?

995
01:06:01,037 --> 01:06:02,818
I'm not selling my share for the money.

996
01:06:04,059 --> 01:06:08,747
In fact, my father died there.
An accident.

997
01:06:08,889 --> 01:06:10,716
Every time I go there I think about it.

998
01:06:11,052 --> 01:06:12,529
I don't want to think about it anymore.

999
01:06:13,137 --> 01:06:15,887
Good.

1000
01:06:16,055 --> 01:06:17,719
I appreciate it.

1001
01:06:18,910 --> 01:06:20,222
So long, comrade.

1002
01:06:37,025 --> 01:06:40,701
Good morning!
- You came!

1003
01:06:40,702 --> 01:06:47,158
You know me?
- What a beauty! Pose for me!

1004
01:06:47,159 --> 01:06:51,160
You work like Kandinsky? Yes, you
answer my questions, OK.

1005
01:06:51,909 --> 01:06:53,455
Nude, possibly?

1006
01:06:53,754 --> 01:06:56,379
Picasso has already done Guernica,
settle down.

1007
01:06:56,724 --> 01:06:59,146
Good! Let's go to the garden,

1008
01:06:59,147 --> 01:07:02,811
the light will look better on your face.

1009
01:07:03,066 --> 01:07:05,822
As long as it's on my face, there
won't be a problem.

1010
01:07:06,702 --> 01:07:10,124
You, you like the nude.
- Yes.

1011
01:07:11,134 --> 01:07:14,759
You can strip to paint me,
I don't care. Let's go.

1012
01:07:15,876 --> 01:07:17,955
Have you been a model a long time?

1013
01:07:17,969 --> 01:07:22,304
I'm not a model, I'm a Gen-dar-me...

1014
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:25,424
Really? A Gendarme! It's not possible!

1015
01:07:25,425 --> 01:07:27,678
...and I've come to talk to you

1016
01:07:27,679 --> 01:07:31,746
about Mr. Guy Lemaire.
- Guy? He's my friend!

1017
01:07:31,778 --> 01:07:34,731
We're like "that", him and me!
Yes?

1018
01:07:35,262 --> 01:07:38,457
We play rugby together.

1019
01:07:38,604 --> 01:07:39,674
Do you play rugby?

1020
01:07:39,675 --> 01:07:43,809
Yes. I'm number 9, and Guy,
he's number 10.

1021
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:46,835
When was the last time you
played with him?

1022
01:07:47,870 --> 01:07:48,956
When?

1023
01:07:51,090 --> 01:07:53,074
You're putting me on the spot!

1024
01:07:54,807 --> 01:07:59,120
I must confess that sometimes
I have memory lapses.

1025
01:07:59,589 --> 01:08:03,652
It doesn't stop me from playing!
- Or being friends with Mr Guy.

1026
01:08:03,665 --> 01:08:09,486
Yes! Bros! Thoroughly!
- And his sister Louise,

1027
01:08:09,862 --> 01:08:11,097
you were friends with her too?

1028
01:08:11,098 --> 01:08:16,261
Louise? A big bitch! She can't
stand me.

1029
01:08:16,663 --> 01:08:19,530
I think she's in love with me.

1030
01:08:20,416 --> 01:08:21,705
I wonder why.

1031
01:08:21,873 --> 01:08:23,923
Huh?
- No, I said: "Really?"

1032
01:08:23,931 --> 01:08:27,958
Back to Guy and his sister, was
that going well?

1033
01:08:28,075 --> 01:08:29,840
Not at all.

1034
01:08:31,654 --> 01:08:36,154
The last time I saw a Guy, he
said to me:

1035
01:08:37,202 --> 01:08:39,936
"She and I have a long-standing beef.

1036
01:08:40,835 --> 01:08:43,452
And if she doesn't agree, it's
the same, what I told her."

1037
01:08:44,066 --> 01:08:46,641
The report on the farm.
- What?

1038
01:08:46,642 --> 01:08:49,458
A sales report?
- No.

1039
01:08:51,045 --> 01:08:54,395
Not a sale! In relation to the land,
a report about the land;

1040
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:57,245
he asked me for advice about the land.

1041
01:08:57,262 --> 01:09:01,918
Are you a farmer too?
- No! I'm a geologist!

1042
01:09:02,611 --> 01:09:05,838
I set up my business in 1970.

1043
01:09:06,026 --> 01:09:10,457
"Soil Expert" it's called!
And it's still active.

1044
01:09:10,602 --> 01:09:15,907
It's good to be active. And
who takes care of your business?

1045
01:09:15,987 --> 01:09:17,486
Mr. Marechal.

1046
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:22,754
Marechal? What'd he used to be?
Is his number Vichy 40-44?

1047
01:09:22,755 --> 01:09:26,359
No, I think not. Wait:

1048
01:09:27,285 --> 01:09:30,270
yes, I know him! What was he called?

1049
01:09:30,271 --> 01:09:33,947
Wood cross, iron cross, if he comes
back he's going back to hell.

1050
01:09:35,744 --> 01:09:37,494
Can I see it?

1051
01:09:37,563 --> 01:09:39,735
Here, look.
- Here it is:

1052
01:09:41,403 --> 01:09:42,802
Yes, it's similar.

1053
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:46,936
A "Mochetticelli."
- No! Botticelli,

1054
01:09:46,937 --> 01:09:51,080
a great Renaissance painter! And
that's your head!

1055
01:09:51,572 --> 01:09:52,717
Yes, sadly.

1056
01:09:58,085 --> 01:10:00,835
You're early.
- I just got your message.

1057
01:10:01,454 --> 01:10:05,853
I'll finish this and then we'll chat.
- I'll help, it will go faster.

1058
01:10:07,447 --> 01:10:09,486
Don't ruin your beautiful outfit.

1059
01:10:10,305 --> 01:10:12,821
When you weren't walking yet I was
already working in the fields.

1060
01:10:13,619 --> 01:10:17,026
50 years old and I never tire of it.
- Yeah.

1061
01:10:17,735 --> 01:10:19,360
There are other places as beautiful
as this.

1062
01:10:19,929 --> 01:10:24,281
Maybe, but I don't see myself
anywhere else.

1063
01:10:25,694 --> 01:10:32,146
Eric, I have to tell you: I'm sorry
about the other day.

1064
01:10:32,327 --> 01:10:35,851
Are you kidding? You had just learned
about Laetitia's death.

1065
01:10:35,908 --> 01:10:38,033
I would have gone awry too.

1066
01:10:39,317 --> 01:10:40,610
Here.

1067
01:10:48,354 --> 01:10:51,160
I'll show it to my lawyer. But
for me, it's good.

1068
01:10:54,477 --> 01:10:58,093
Gypsy Kings, Barry White, Brigitte-

1069
01:10:59,679 --> 01:11:01,007
An <i>iguanodon</i> egg!

1070
01:11:02,530 --> 01:11:07,343
A little snail. Damn, it's
beautiful, that one!

1071
01:11:09,848 --> 01:11:13,176
There's Marechal!
- Marechal, are you back?

1072
01:11:13,485 --> 01:11:15,540
Always so nice to see you.

1073
01:11:15,915 --> 01:11:17,563
Let's go, girls...

1074
01:11:17,564 --> 01:11:20,776
Calm down, Grandpa Weinstein.
- My real name is Ferrand,

1075
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:21,738
Nicolas Ferrand.

1076
01:11:21,758 --> 01:11:25,571
Marleau, Captain Marleau.
- Do you like <i>clinochrysotile</i>?

1077
01:11:25,572 --> 01:11:27,859
Looks like coal.

1078
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:31,035
Mr. Jean-Claude, do you remember
the other name

1079
01:11:31,052 --> 01:11:33,603
for <i>clinochrysotile</i>?
- Asbestos.

1080
01:11:34,170 --> 01:11:36,482
Yes, it tastes like asbestos.

1081
01:11:37,542 --> 01:11:38,589
You wanted to see me?

1082
01:11:38,590 --> 01:11:42,005
Yes. Do you know Laetitia Lemaire?

1083
01:11:42,006 --> 01:11:45,470
Yes, I had the pleasure to make
her lovely acquaintance.

1084
01:11:45,471 --> 01:11:46,915
She's dead.

1085
01:11:47,294 --> 01:11:49,747
What? What happened?

1086
01:11:49,986 --> 01:11:51,033
Just dead.

1087
01:11:51,602 --> 01:11:54,126
Shall we take a breath of Correze air?

1088
01:11:54,226 --> 01:11:59,548
Mr. Jean-Claude, you still have
your delicious fruit juice?

1089
01:11:59,813 --> 01:12:01,821
Yes, I have a little left.

1090
01:12:10,715 --> 01:12:14,042
I saw Laetitia for the first time
3 weeks ago.

1091
01:12:14,981 --> 01:12:18,862
At Soil Expert, I also cultivate new
clientele, therefore I search.

1092
01:12:18,918 --> 01:12:21,574
You're on a search task too?

1093
01:12:21,636 --> 01:12:25,676
What are you searching for, soils?
- No, the archives.

1094
01:12:26,339 --> 01:12:30,261
Locating old prospecting files to reopen.

1095
01:12:30,371 --> 01:12:33,550
Like files for the Lemaire family?

1096
01:12:33,551 --> 01:12:38,017
Almost 40 years ago Mr. Jean-Claude
was contacted by Mr. Lemaire.

1097
01:12:38,368 --> 01:12:41,135
He wanted to gain an understanding
of his soil,

1098
01:12:41,136 --> 01:12:43,723
hoping to find valuable minerals.

1099
01:12:43,856 --> 01:12:47,254
But there weren't any, in the end.
I thought it could be worth it

1100
01:12:47,255 --> 01:12:49,192
to revisit it.

1101
01:12:49,969 --> 01:12:54,160
40 years later?
- In my field, expiration dates are

1102
01:12:54,161 --> 01:12:55,931
in millions of years.

1103
01:12:57,698 --> 01:13:02,308
And Mr. Lemaire was hoping for
what exactly, gold?

1104
01:13:02,563 --> 01:13:05,618
Better: tungsten.

1105
01:13:05,909 --> 01:13:08,972
Taxten? He saw the light?

1106
01:13:08,973 --> 01:13:11,229
Have you taken your samples?
- No.

1107
01:13:11,230 --> 01:13:13,965
Mrs. Lemaire told me her husband
refused our help.

1108
01:13:13,992 --> 01:13:18,696
You haven't seen her again?
- No; she came to ask me

1109
01:13:18,697 --> 01:13:22,430
if she could search by herself without
her husband knowing.

1110
01:13:22,457 --> 01:13:28,744
I told her where to dig to optimize
her chances of a find.

1111
01:13:28,996 --> 01:13:31,473
You are truly a Soil Expert.

1112
01:13:45,135 --> 01:13:47,143
Mom?

1113
01:13:50,194 --> 01:13:51,436
Mom, are you there?

1114
01:13:57,236 --> 01:13:58,450
Mom?

1115
01:13:59,183 --> 01:14:00,284
Mom, I-

1116
01:14:00,386 --> 01:14:03,082
I wanted to tell you, it's good with Eric.

1117
01:14:03,918 --> 01:14:05,410
He accepted the offer.

1118
01:14:06,260 --> 01:14:09,831
I was thinking we could
go celebrate it in town.

1119
01:14:09,916 --> 01:14:12,128
You know, go to the little restaurant
you like there.

1120
01:14:14,683 --> 01:14:15,936
Mom!

1121
01:14:17,752 --> 01:14:19,533
You can't treat me like this!

1122
01:14:21,322 --> 01:14:25,611
I did it all for you! For you!

1123
01:14:26,644 --> 01:14:28,339
So that you're proud of me!

1124
01:14:29,191 --> 01:14:31,534
At least one time in your life!
You understand?

1125
01:14:32,916 --> 01:14:34,201
Mom!

1126
01:14:35,330 --> 01:14:36,651
I understand;

1127
01:14:37,752 --> 01:14:40,088
you still blame me for yesterday,
is that it?

1128
01:14:40,782 --> 01:14:45,821
I'm sorry. It's this Gendarme who
is bothering me.

1129
01:14:45,822 --> 01:14:47,088
Shut your mouth!

1130
01:14:47,186 --> 01:14:49,147
I don't want your apologies.

1131
01:14:57,166 --> 01:14:58,940
I'm sorry.

1132
01:14:59,742 --> 01:15:03,369
I apologize for being hard on you.

1133
01:15:04,546 --> 01:15:08,975
I realized yesterday how it felt
to feel humiliated.

1134
01:15:09,272 --> 01:15:11,545
I've known that with your grandfather,

1135
01:15:12,344 --> 01:15:15,343
I shouldn't have inflicted him on you.

1136
01:15:16,502 --> 01:15:19,752
I also apologize for asking you to
hide the truth

1137
01:15:19,753 --> 01:15:21,291
about Guy's death.

1138
01:15:23,393 --> 01:15:24,838
You were only 7 years old.

1139
01:15:25,316 --> 01:15:28,426
You don't do that to a 7-year-old child,
it was filthy.

1140
01:15:29,365 --> 01:15:32,182
I also apologize for being angry with you

1141
01:15:32,183 --> 01:15:34,112
about being like your father.

1142
01:15:34,113 --> 01:15:37,181
No, no...

1143
01:15:37,195 --> 01:15:40,664
And I never found the words to tell you

1144
01:15:42,931 --> 01:15:44,587
I love you, son.

1145
01:15:44,746 --> 01:15:50,464
Me too, I love you mom. You're
my mom. I love you.

1146
01:15:56,904 --> 01:15:58,763
OK, that's good.

1147
01:16:06,085 --> 01:16:07,663
So long Greg.
- See you tomorrow.

1148
01:16:07,664 --> 01:16:09,428
See you tomorrow, Margaux.
- So long Briere.

1149
01:16:09,571 --> 01:16:12,345
Hey! Guy Lemaire, when did he die?

1150
01:16:12,657 --> 01:16:15,595
I don't remember.
- Show me the folder.

1151
01:16:21,155 --> 01:16:22,249
This one.

1152
01:16:22,583 --> 01:16:24,740
So what does it say?

1153
01:16:25,701 --> 01:16:28,624
There, as I suspected.
- What?

1154
01:16:28,686 --> 01:16:31,905
He died on May 18th, 1980.
- Yes.

1155
01:16:31,906 --> 01:16:35,787
Two weeks earlier, he called a soil
expert to sample the soil,

1156
01:16:35,788 --> 01:16:38,592
to see if there was tungsten.
- And?

1157
01:16:38,796 --> 01:16:42,756
Laetitia Lemaire, 3 weeks before her
death, she called a soil expert

1158
01:16:42,757 --> 01:16:45,514
to dig to see if there was tungsten.

1159
01:16:45,515 --> 01:16:49,389
As soon as they get interested in
the thing, they die.

1160
01:16:49,390 --> 01:16:50,944
Yeah.
- That means?

1161
01:16:50,982 --> 01:16:54,529
Being their soil expert is an
anteater nest,

1162
01:16:55,935 --> 01:16:59,912
there is something rotten in the
kingdom of Lemaire.

1163
01:17:01,014 --> 01:17:04,225
Ghosts! Ghosts. Yeah.

1164
01:17:58,516 --> 01:18:01,598
This is where I advised Mrs. Lemaire
to do some digging.

1165
01:18:01,599 --> 01:18:03,278
Why here?

1166
01:18:04,129 --> 01:18:09,019
The soil! It's a little lighter, a
little richer.

1167
01:18:09,177 --> 01:18:11,387
That's the clue that it contains sediment.

1168
01:18:12,193 --> 01:18:13,419
Proof school.

1169
01:18:13,420 --> 01:18:16,489
In any case, there's no proof she
dug somewhere.

1170
01:18:16,490 --> 01:18:19,871
There are no holes!
- Did she not have the opportunity?

1171
01:18:19,966 --> 01:18:21,036
Maybe.

1172
01:18:21,543 --> 01:18:24,615
Or maybe she dug, but didn't
want it to show.

1173
01:18:25,566 --> 01:18:26,872
What is this mess?

1174
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:28,966
A horse rack.

1175
01:18:28,996 --> 01:18:33,325
For food? Horse dentures? Where?

1176
01:18:33,326 --> 01:18:36,912
There.
- 50m from the food?

1177
01:18:37,456 --> 01:18:39,035
Why is it wobbling?

1178
01:18:39,067 --> 01:18:41,067
And plastic there.

1179
01:18:41,434 --> 01:18:44,559
That's not very green! Help me look.

1180
01:18:51,918 --> 01:18:54,629
It's hard, it's soft, but it's in the hole!

1181
01:19:01,604 --> 01:19:03,354
COURTHOUSE

1182
01:19:06,668 --> 01:19:07,887
It's there, right?

1183
01:19:15,475 --> 01:19:17,068
Are you going to Mass afterward?

1184
01:19:17,083 --> 01:19:20,880
It's a consultation hearing, not
a circuit court trial.

1185
01:19:21,646 --> 01:19:25,941
Eric, we need to talk to you.
- What? Your voice sounds funny.

1186
01:19:26,199 --> 01:19:29,230
You want more money?
- No, it's not that.

1187
01:19:29,254 --> 01:19:33,246
So everything is fine! My lawyer
validated your offer.

1188
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:37,111
I tell the judge, and in 2 hours we
have a drink together, OK?

1189
01:19:37,306 --> 01:19:40,892
We're up first. All good?
- Yes, we're coming.

1190
01:19:42,908 --> 01:19:45,728
Christophe, we'll talk after. OK?

1191
01:19:46,619 --> 01:19:47,747
OK.

1192
01:19:51,839 --> 01:19:56,225
All right! First case: Lemaire
vs. Lemaire.

1193
01:19:57,444 --> 01:19:59,327
Are both parties present?

1194
01:19:59,584 --> 01:20:02,868
Yes madam president.
- Yes, yes madam president.

1195
01:20:03,291 --> 01:20:05,772
You don't have representation, Mr. Lemaire?

1196
01:20:05,791 --> 01:20:10,089
No. I didn't know I had to have one.

1197
01:20:10,542 --> 01:20:12,198
It would have been better.

1198
01:20:12,199 --> 01:20:14,332
We will do without. I summarize:

1199
01:20:14,761 --> 01:20:17,035
Two-thirds of the co-owners
want to sell.

1200
01:20:17,036 --> 01:20:19,146
There's no compromise,

1201
01:20:19,147 --> 01:20:22,483
so you request a goods auction.
That's it?

1202
01:20:22,771 --> 01:20:26,247
There has been a last-minute change.

1203
01:20:27,005 --> 01:20:30,122
Mr. Christophe Lemaire made an offer
to my client,

1204
01:20:30,474 --> 01:20:31,966
which we have accepted.

1205
01:20:32,386 --> 01:20:35,839
A compromise! It will go quickly-
- Wait, wait.

1206
01:20:35,868 --> 01:20:38,312
I have to say something first.

1207
01:20:38,313 --> 01:20:40,401
That's not the procedure.

1208
01:20:41,096 --> 01:20:43,729
Yes, but; whatever.

1209
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:49,853
Eric, we want you to know something.

1210
01:20:51,369 --> 01:20:56,226
40 years ago, your father didn't die
by falling off a ladder.

1211
01:20:57,170 --> 01:20:58,576
He'd been drinking.

1212
01:20:59,427 --> 01:21:01,966
He was going to come after me.
And my mother-

1213
01:21:02,471 --> 01:21:04,869
my mother stopped him;

1214
01:21:05,130 --> 01:21:06,989
and killed him, but it was an accident.

1215
01:21:07,291 --> 01:21:11,063
That's not trivial!
- You had to know

1216
01:21:11,064 --> 01:21:13,400
before accepting my offer.

1217
01:21:14,715 --> 01:21:17,597
Well, it seemed to me more honest
for our side.

1218
01:21:28,342 --> 01:21:29,795
My father was an asshole.

1219
01:21:30,470 --> 01:21:33,782
A violent drunk who hit for pleasure.

1220
01:21:34,415 --> 01:21:36,860
It was often my turn to pay the price.

1221
01:21:38,142 --> 01:21:41,916
For me, selling this farm means getting
rid of him for good.

1222
01:21:43,393 --> 01:21:45,080
But you should have told me, Christophe.

1223
01:21:46,290 --> 01:21:49,821
I trusted you. We were like brothers.

1224
01:21:50,549 --> 01:21:51,779
I know.

1225
01:21:52,135 --> 01:21:54,924
Listen, what are we doing here?

1226
01:21:55,781 --> 01:21:58,110
We'll sell to someone else,
but we're selling.

1227
01:21:58,111 --> 01:21:59,640
Perfect! A compromise!

1228
01:21:59,641 --> 01:22:02,185
And now my decision, sir-

1229
01:22:02,602 --> 01:22:03,938
Wait.
- What now?

1230
01:22:03,939 --> 01:22:07,461
I just received another buyout proposal,
a buyback.

1231
01:22:07,763 --> 01:22:13,052
My client must be informed.
- Considering the stage we're at, proceed!

1232
01:22:18,019 --> 01:22:21,363
My client withdraws his request,
we have found a buyer.

1233
01:22:21,364 --> 01:22:26,121
The opposite would have surprised me.
You made my day!

1234
01:22:26,128 --> 01:22:28,620
Case adjourned, we move on.

1235
01:22:33,839 --> 01:22:36,097
Who buys two-thirds of a farm?

1236
01:22:36,098 --> 01:22:37,593
It doesn't make sense.

1237
01:23:16,032 --> 01:23:19,376
It's OK, we don't mind!
- Come in, make yourself at home.

1238
01:23:20,211 --> 01:23:24,046
I don't want to hear your sarcasm
and innuendo.

1239
01:23:24,173 --> 01:23:25,845
Sarcasm, pray for us.

1240
01:23:26,131 --> 01:23:29,568
What do you say, Soil Expert?

1241
01:23:29,811 --> 01:23:33,257
They're the geologists. Laetitia
told me about it.

1242
01:23:33,718 --> 01:23:37,516
They want to dig up my fields
to find metal, right?

1243
01:23:37,517 --> 01:23:41,602
Yes. Tungsten.
- This story of minerals,

1244
01:23:41,603 --> 01:23:43,203
it's a legend.

1245
01:23:43,382 --> 01:23:46,898
Nobody has ever found anything
around here.

1246
01:23:46,899 --> 01:23:48,442
Yes! Me!

1247
01:23:49,121 --> 01:23:51,316
Hold this for me, I'll show you.

1248
01:23:52,948 --> 01:23:54,221
Do you know what this is?

1249
01:23:54,735 --> 01:23:58,469
It's called wolframite, from the
Latin "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart"

1250
01:23:58,470 --> 01:24:02,625
and "moth," as in moth. Inside it's
full of tungsten.

1251
01:24:02,907 --> 01:24:03,902
Yup.

1252
01:24:03,922 --> 01:24:05,328
Where did you find it?

1253
01:24:05,329 --> 01:24:08,302
In a hole, but not in a mine.
Come see.

1254
01:24:09,062 --> 01:24:10,234
You see?

1255
01:24:10,298 --> 01:24:15,462
I found it here. And it was Soil Expert
who told me

1256
01:24:15,463 --> 01:24:19,118
that below here, there was a
big juicy vein.

1257
01:24:19,701 --> 01:24:23,935
How did you find out?
- Thank Uncle Guy.

1258
01:24:24,061 --> 01:24:26,968
40 years ago, he said to himself:
"there must be tungsten here!"

1259
01:24:26,969 --> 01:24:31,405
So he called Soil Expert to
find out where exactly.

1260
01:24:31,576 --> 01:24:35,240
Your brother have the idea to turn
your farm

1261
01:24:35,241 --> 01:24:38,270
into a kind of Germinal of tungsten.

1262
01:24:38,271 --> 01:24:40,485
Like Laetitia.

1263
01:24:40,687 --> 01:24:44,492
No kidding? That's crazy! In your family,

1264
01:24:44,525 --> 01:24:47,955
as soon as they touch a little
tungsten, they die!

1265
01:24:47,956 --> 01:24:50,022
It must be a genetic disease.

1266
01:24:50,593 --> 01:24:53,233
Unless someone in your family

1267
01:24:53,234 --> 01:24:57,290
doesn't want that for your house.
Huh, Mrs. Louise?

1268
01:24:57,390 --> 01:25:01,758
Unbelievable! You don't believe her?

1269
01:25:02,156 --> 01:25:06,453
She suspects everyone. I must be
last on the list.

1270
01:25:06,795 --> 01:25:10,654
You have no proof!
- No need for proof:

1271
01:25:10,655 --> 01:25:12,076
you're a woman of honor, no?

1272
01:25:12,077 --> 01:25:15,826
"My word, the earth!
The earth, my word!"

1273
01:25:15,989 --> 01:25:19,841
Swear you didn't kill your daughter-in-
law and I'll leave you alone!

1274
01:25:20,259 --> 01:25:24,807
But no, it wasn't...
- No. It was to protect our land.

1275
01:25:25,553 --> 01:25:28,342
To protect our heritage.

1276
01:25:29,830 --> 01:25:33,064
To protect you.
- Yeah?

1277
01:25:33,561 --> 01:25:36,171
You kill your brother and your
daughter-in-law

1278
01:25:36,172 --> 01:25:40,080
to protect your land? Well done!
You're a woman of honor!

1279
01:25:40,345 --> 01:25:42,493
Of great humanity.

1280
01:25:50,412 --> 01:25:55,468
There, and there. End of the case of
the woman with two lives.

1281
01:25:55,796 --> 01:25:58,773
You don't seem convinced.
- Yes, in two words.

1282
01:25:58,779 --> 01:26:03,592
The mother-in-law killed to protect
her land. Ovary rage!

1283
01:26:03,662 --> 01:26:07,788
Funny profession. We crack a case, we
should be happy.

1284
01:26:07,789 --> 01:26:10,242
But no.
- Nothing to be proud of.

1285
01:26:10,339 --> 01:26:12,949
Stopping a killer doesn't bring
the victim back.

1286
01:26:13,133 --> 01:26:15,641
A 75-year-old woman in prison!

1287
01:26:16,029 --> 01:26:19,918
In 3 days her son loses his wife, his
mother, and his farm!

1288
01:26:20,046 --> 01:26:22,600
Well, he still has his wife's horses.

1289
01:26:22,624 --> 01:26:25,288
A gift! I'm afraid of those critters.

1290
01:26:26,052 --> 01:26:30,583
Is that so? Are you a coward? And
since when?

1291
01:26:30,678 --> 01:26:33,553
Last year. We investigated mutilations.

1292
01:26:33,554 --> 01:26:37,553
A nervous horse kicked me!

1293
01:26:37,554 --> 01:26:40,311
Two weeks in the hospital! I had
something here-

1294
01:26:41,629 --> 01:26:44,010
Captain?
- You're a genius.

1295
01:26:44,128 --> 01:26:47,566
A horse genius!
- That's a compliment?

1296
01:27:07,222 --> 01:27:10,097
You didn't have to bring her to
witness your triumph.

1297
01:27:11,184 --> 01:27:14,325
The redneck has lost everything,
your honor is secure.

1298
01:27:14,326 --> 01:27:16,873
Garance is at home here.

1299
01:27:17,382 --> 01:27:20,101
I have bought your cousin's shares.

1300
01:27:20,256 --> 01:27:25,044
It's beyond triumph. You've
won everything!

1301
01:27:25,808 --> 01:27:28,949
Nobody's won. We've lost
two women we loved.

1302
01:27:30,245 --> 01:27:31,760
I have a proposition.

1303
01:27:32,469 --> 01:27:35,953
You pay me an annual rent, and at the
end of a period to be determined,

1304
01:27:35,990 --> 01:27:37,139
the farm is yours.

1305
01:27:37,143 --> 01:27:41,221
In exchange, you let Garance
spend time here

1306
01:27:41,415 --> 01:27:44,383
whenever she wants.
- Why would you do this?

1307
01:27:44,590 --> 01:27:46,981
For Garance. She loves this place.

1308
01:27:47,380 --> 01:27:48,747
And she likes you.

1309
01:27:49,217 --> 01:27:52,537
And also for Pauline: if she loved you,

1310
01:27:52,786 --> 01:27:55,693
I can make an effort to get to know you.

1311
01:28:04,852 --> 01:28:10,149
Hey! How beautiful it is, the
holy family!

1312
01:28:10,602 --> 01:28:16,810
Captain, you'll never guess.
- You too! Do you remember

1313
01:28:16,811 --> 01:28:18,874
my theory that your wife hit you?

1314
01:28:18,875 --> 01:28:21,298
That's how you got this injury,

1315
01:28:21,299 --> 01:28:25,792
from a metal thing, but I didn't
know what. Look!

1316
01:28:26,677 --> 01:28:28,513
Horseshoe.
- Yeah.

1317
01:28:28,514 --> 01:28:30,319
The truth was under a horse's hoof.

1318
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:31,766
Tell me everything

1319
01:28:31,767 --> 01:28:35,747
or I'll smack you with this
good luck charm.

1320
01:28:53,896 --> 01:28:56,732
<i>So, you meet men in the middle
of nowhere?</i>

1321
01:29:00,205 --> 01:29:03,127
<i>I have a daughter. Her name
is Garance.</i>

1322
01:29:04,288 --> 01:29:07,305
<i>It's a pretty first name.
- I wanted to tell you a thousand times.</i>

1323
01:29:07,316 --> 01:29:09,957
<i>Why now?
- I want to see her again.</i>

1324
01:29:10,300 --> 01:29:15,956
<i>I see; you want to go back to your
old life: if your daughter, her father-</i>

1325
01:29:15,957 --> 01:29:19,675
<i>I'm sorting all this out. Then we'll
leave, you and me.</i>

1326
01:29:20,001 --> 01:29:23,094
<i>Leave? We have the farm!</i>

1327
01:29:23,095 --> 01:29:25,439
<i>We're going to lose the farm,
you know.</i>

1328
01:29:26,250 --> 01:29:29,023
<i>Let's take advantage: We buy
a shack for your mother,</i>

1329
01:29:29,024 --> 01:29:32,408
<i>and we leave. We rebuild our life.</i>

1330
01:29:32,409 --> 01:29:36,279
<i>With Garance?
- If she wants. What do you say?</i>

1331
01:29:38,124 --> 01:29:42,273
<i>No, my place is here. I was born
here, I will die here.</i>

1332
01:29:42,274 --> 01:29:45,030
<i>This farm is going to kill us!</i>

1333
01:29:45,822 --> 01:29:49,823
<i>I'm not leaving. This is my land.
- You'll leave your skin here!</i>

1334
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:54,033
<i>I don't want to see your waste away
without doing anything. I can't.</i>

1335
01:29:54,548 --> 01:29:56,744
<i>I'm leaving. I love you, but I'm leaving.</i>

1336
01:29:56,745 --> 01:29:59,196
<i>If you love me don't go.
- I'm leaving because I love you.</i>

1337
01:29:59,197 --> 01:30:00,283
<i>Don't go!</i>

1338
01:30:01,678 --> 01:30:02,717
<i>Don't go!</i>

1339
01:30:35,712 --> 01:30:38,596
I panicked. I wasn't myself.

1340
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:41,769
Yeah, panic can make you crazy.
We tell ourselves:

1341
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:44,777
"My wife is too beautiful for me,
she's going to leave."

1342
01:30:44,778 --> 01:30:49,002
We prepare for it, but the day it
happens, we go crazy.

1343
01:30:57,097 --> 01:30:59,893
She was acting strange for weeks.

1344
01:31:00,753 --> 01:31:02,410
She was already elsewhere.

1345
01:31:03,161 --> 01:31:05,185
When she told me she was
going to leave,

1346
01:31:05,794 --> 01:31:10,740
I came here to the farm, all alone,
with my mother,

1347
01:31:11,675 --> 01:31:14,378
with only my thoughts of farming.

1348
01:31:15,489 --> 01:31:18,191
And go back to square one: an old
boy and his mom.

1349
01:31:18,885 --> 01:31:22,891
Yes, it was, after these 10 years
of happiness.

1350
01:31:29,642 --> 01:31:31,220
How could I kill her?

1351
01:31:32,633 --> 01:31:36,563
Madness! I killed her!

1352
01:31:37,790 --> 01:31:40,564
Passionate love. To love is not to kill.

1353
01:31:41,921 --> 01:31:43,046
Take him away.

1354
01:31:51,233 --> 01:31:52,389
Watch your head.

1355
01:32:29,926 --> 01:32:33,638
You're not the first to confess in order
to protect someone else.

1356
01:32:34,028 --> 01:32:36,388
It was a way to redeem myself.

1357
01:32:37,527 --> 01:32:41,441
And my regret for the life
I made him lead.

1358
01:32:44,567 --> 01:32:46,880
He never trusted himself.

1359
01:32:47,501 --> 01:32:48,571
It's my fault.

1360
01:32:48,882 --> 01:32:50,507
That's why he killed her.

1361
01:32:51,666 --> 01:32:52,853
She loved him.

1362
01:32:54,495 --> 01:32:56,409
He couldn't believe it.

1363
01:32:57,163 --> 01:33:00,671
Maybe he was right.
- Right? Why?

1364
01:33:00,688 --> 01:33:03,946
The idea that 60 km away was
her old life,

1365
01:33:04,905 --> 01:33:07,155
maybe she wanted to go back to it.

1366
01:33:07,230 --> 01:33:10,925
That we will never know, madam.

1367
01:33:11,270 --> 01:33:13,005
Can I see my son?

1368
01:33:13,026 --> 01:33:15,034
Maybe, one day.

1369
01:33:15,659 --> 01:33:17,745
You should light a candle to
St. Oedipus.

1370
01:33:19,082 --> 01:33:21,300
I'm going; good luck, Mrs. Louise.
