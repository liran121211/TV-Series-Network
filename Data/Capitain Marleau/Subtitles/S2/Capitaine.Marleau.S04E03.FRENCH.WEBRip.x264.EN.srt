1
00:00:02,847 --> 00:00:04,675
Hey, bunch of noses!

2
00:00:05,693 --> 00:00:07,342
Whoa...

3
00:00:07,824 --> 00:00:09,699
Who are you?

4
00:00:15,675 --> 00:00:16,795
No.

5
00:00:17,335 --> 00:00:19,413
I'm Lt. Castel.

6
00:00:19,414 --> 00:00:20,785
Yeah?
- Yes.

7
00:00:20,957 --> 00:00:22,009
Chair.

8
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:24,583
Captain.

9
00:00:24,706 --> 00:00:30,199
A small, strong black coffee.
- With pleasure.

10
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:11,094
CLEAR DARKNESS

11
00:01:43,012 --> 00:01:44,644
Yeah, how are you?

12
00:01:45,098 --> 00:01:47,059
Aren't you coming today?

13
00:01:48,927 --> 00:01:50,039
OK.

14
00:02:01,317 --> 00:02:04,355
...their cries in the slaughterhouse!
<i>- Drop it.</i>

15
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:07,011
We kill 2 billion animals weekly.

16
00:02:07,038 --> 00:02:10,493
<i>Forget your plan.</i>

17
00:02:10,494 --> 00:02:12,291
You don't want to help me anymore.

18
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:14,872
<i>We'll talk about it tomorrow.</i>

19
00:02:22,558 --> 00:02:25,175
Hey Maude.
- Eat a little?

20
00:02:25,765 --> 00:02:28,273
Since when?
- It's a time to talk

21
00:02:28,274 --> 00:02:29,656
if you have the opportunity.

22
00:02:31,923 --> 00:02:33,993
How are you doing in high school?

23
00:02:33,994 --> 00:02:35,536
How are YOU doing?

24
00:02:35,537 --> 00:02:38,789
You talk to your father, talk
to me too.

25
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,252
You're not my mother, I'm doing well,

26
00:02:42,253 --> 00:02:43,393
don't force it.

27
00:02:43,807 --> 00:02:45,120

A pack?

38
00:03:47,306 --> 00:03:49,743
We say 'horde' or 'herd.'

39
00:03:49,883 --> 00:03:52,462
They swarm.
- Is it due to the climate warming?

40
00:03:54,163 --> 00:03:56,764
The absence of predators.
- Exactly.

41
00:03:57,399 --> 00:04:02,264
We have to find a balance between
control and proliferation,

42
00:04:02,552 --> 00:04:03,763
and protect them.

43
00:04:06,427 --> 00:04:07,559
Did you see the time?

44
00:04:08,141 --> 00:04:11,712
You want to go home?
- My parents will flip their lids.

45
00:04:11,713 --> 00:04:15,510
You'll protect me, like the animals.

46
00:04:16,975 --> 00:04:18,499
I'll catch up with you.

47
00:04:18,752 --> 00:04:19,794
OK.

48
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:33,251
Are you following me?
- No, I'm walking.

49
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,997
Stay with us.

50
00:04:36,305 --> 00:04:38,665
You shouldn't have quit.

51
00:04:45,237 --> 00:04:46,511
Hi.
- Hi.

52
00:04:57,244 --> 00:04:59,723
Come back.
- I don't know.

53
00:04:59,724 --> 00:05:02,026
We miss you.

54
00:05:02,027 --> 00:05:04,230
Hey!
- I'm coming.

55
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:13,343
It's not too late?
- You finished the year.

56
00:05:13,344 --> 00:05:14,897
Yes.
- Yes.

57
00:05:34,947 --> 00:05:38,071
Good morning, Colonel.
- Mr. Mayor, Prefect.

58
00:05:40,713 --> 00:05:42,354
Fuck. All good?

59
00:05:47,552 --> 00:05:49,669
Good morning.
- We're about to decorate you,

60
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,634
The General of the Army is there,

61
00:05:52,295 --> 00:05:53,756
and you arrive in this get-up.

62
00:05:53,757 --> 00:05:56,129
Seriously, Captain.
- It's clean...

63
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,357
Go and change. Now.

64
00:06:02,313 --> 00:06:03,610
She made a face at me.

65
00:06:03,611 --> 00:06:04,902
<i>The recipient of-</i>

66
00:06:05,436 --> 00:06:08,506
I don't care!

67
00:06:09,091 --> 00:06:10,739
About anything!

68
00:06:12,217 --> 00:06:14,404
Ugly!

69
00:06:14,405 --> 00:06:16,070
A call, who's calling me?

70
00:06:19,054 --> 00:06:20,069
Yeah?

71
00:06:20,655 --> 00:06:22,265
; fuck.

72
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:24,844
Very well, I'm coming.

73
00:06:30,909 --> 00:06:32,136
We're waiting for you.

74
00:06:32,137 --> 00:06:34,983
No time, an emergency.

75
00:06:34,984 --> 00:06:36,978
Gotta go, Happy New Year!

76
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,990
So, cause of death?
- A blow to the temple.

77
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,027
With bare hands?

78
00:07:01,028 --> 00:07:04,764
It was no Mike Tyson. I opt
for a bladed weapon.

79
00:07:05,028 --> 00:07:06,348
Time of death?

80
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:09,021
Between 10 pm and midnight.

81
00:07:09,348 --> 00:07:11,810
No signs of a struggle?
- No.

82
00:07:12,696 --> 00:07:14,931
Not easy.

83
00:07:19,855 --> 00:07:22,834
Wow, elegant!
- I'm good!

84
00:07:23,005 --> 00:07:25,177
It won't be easy.
- Why?

85
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,865
Claire Duret,
- Yeah...

86
00:07:26,866 --> 00:07:29,824
17, by the ID found on her.

87
00:07:29,994 --> 00:07:31,447
It was a jogger who called;

88
00:07:31,464 --> 00:07:36,152
says he's been waiting and
wants to finish his run.

89
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,910
He'll wait. Where is she?
- Down there.

90
00:07:41,104 --> 00:07:42,307
Thanks, honey.

91
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,161
Oscar! How are you, my homey?

92
00:07:45,162 --> 00:07:47,528
Captain.
- Covid kiss.

93
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,475
Nice to see you.

94
00:07:50,566 --> 00:07:53,144
How goes it with you?

95
00:07:53,292 --> 00:07:55,956
Well; poor kid.

96
00:07:57,551 --> 00:07:59,887
Where's the asshole?
- Down there.

97
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,863
Thanks, I can manage.

98
00:08:02,864 --> 00:08:06,728
So, in a hurry?
- I said all I have to say.

99
00:08:07,218 --> 00:08:08,890
Less than the kid.

100
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,238
Didn't that affect you?

101
00:08:11,239 --> 00:08:13,901
Yes, but-
- Tell me.

102
00:08:14,049 --> 00:08:18,690
I wanted to see my stats: calories
burned, gradient.

103
00:08:18,691 --> 00:08:22,125
What a Big Ben! 90 calories per hour.

104
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:24,487
You saw?
- I saw her hand sticking out,

105
00:08:24,488 --> 00:08:25,753
as I was passing.

106
00:08:25,912 --> 00:08:28,483
Poor girl. That's all?

107
00:08:28,644 --> 00:08:30,261
We'll ask around.

108
00:08:30,357 --> 00:08:32,701
Did you get his name?
- Yes.

109
00:08:32,702 --> 00:08:34,745
And get his DNA?
- No.

110
00:08:34,746 --> 00:08:36,052
My DNA?

111
00:08:36,292 --> 00:08:40,105
To see if you hit her. We have
to search you.

112
00:08:40,106 --> 00:08:42,002
You can't.
- Yes.

113
00:08:42,003 --> 00:08:44,493
I'm going.
- No, hey hey! Come here.

114
00:08:44,933 --> 00:08:47,168
Empty your pockets. Go on!

115
00:08:48,017 --> 00:08:50,127
No, but-
- There's that.

116
00:08:50,128 --> 00:08:52,752
As if by chance.

117
00:08:52,753 --> 00:08:53,981
Where was this?

118
00:08:53,982 --> 00:08:55,709
Next to her.
- Next to her where?

119
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,789
There are numbers, which number?

120
00:08:58,993 --> 00:09:00,797
Number 4.
- You're sure?

121
00:09:00,798 --> 00:09:02,786
Not next to that?

122
00:09:03,592 --> 00:09:06,084
Killing for that is stupid.
- No.

123
00:09:06,085 --> 00:09:07,568
We'll, maybe. Good.

124
00:09:07,569 --> 00:09:10,359
Christophe, Richard. Take him away.

125
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,290
We'll talk by the fire.

126
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,891
Huh? Seriously?
- Well yes!

127
00:09:14,892 --> 00:09:15,850
No.
- Yes.

128
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:19,311
Come ON!
- You'll like the chicken, it's good.

129
00:09:20,119 --> 00:09:23,322
Wait, I want to check something.

130
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,149
Take her arm.

131
00:09:27,283 --> 00:09:29,017
So; hey...

132
00:09:29,122 --> 00:09:31,669
Do we agree, it's too big.

133
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:36,369
Yes.
- No sign of dragging.

134
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,862
She was killed here.
- Impossible,

135
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:42,158
not according to the lividity
of her skin.

136
00:09:42,189 --> 00:09:43,900
Was she carried here?

137
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,978
Yes, but you have to be strong.

138
00:09:46,979 --> 00:09:50,443
Yes, or: there was more than one.

139
00:09:53,187 --> 00:09:54,413
Wait, she'll call.

140
00:09:54,414 --> 00:09:57,702
She wouldn't leave without saying.
- And if she's not at Jules's?

141
00:10:05,956 --> 00:10:07,136
Good morning.

142
00:10:07,588 --> 00:10:11,169
Gendarmerie, Captain Marleau.
Claire Duret is your daughter?

143
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:13,518
Indeed.
- My step-daughter.

144
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,838
We found your daughter's body
this morning.

145
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:18,292
Claire?

146
00:10:19,979 --> 00:10:21,268
It's not true.

147
00:10:33,013 --> 00:10:34,560
Did she suffer?
- No,

148
00:10:34,561 --> 00:10:36,540
the first blow was fatal.

149
00:10:36,704 --> 00:10:40,906
On her here, a focal contusion to
the cerebellum.

150
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:42,286
Immediate brain disconnect.

151
00:10:42,287 --> 00:10:44,279
She didn't feel anything.

152
00:10:45,203 --> 00:10:47,970
After her mother's death 10 years ago,

153
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,147
we continued to treat her as living.

154
00:10:53,494 --> 00:10:55,556
Can you leave us, please?

155
00:11:14,629 --> 00:11:18,015
My husband came home this
morning from a seminar.

156
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:19,651
And you?

157
00:11:19,671 --> 00:11:22,819
I was at a party for parents of students.

158
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:26,352
Her high school?
- Yes, I'm the principal.

159
00:11:26,678 --> 00:11:29,389
Principal and stepmother, you're
cumulative.

160
00:11:30,572 --> 00:11:32,291
Yeah, by the way,

161
00:11:34,046 --> 00:11:35,726
do you know this?

162
00:11:35,727 --> 00:11:38,904
I had just offered it to her,
to bring us closer.

163
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,560
It was my grandmother's.
- It's too big.

164
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,140
It had to be adjusted, but I imagine
she'd still wear it.

165
00:11:46,313 --> 00:11:48,046
Excuse me, I must leave you.

166
00:11:48,047 --> 00:11:49,719
Please, madam.

167
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,177
Are you there?

168
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:01,633
The jogger was telling the truth,
he's clean.

169
00:12:01,634 --> 00:12:03,587
We let him go.
- Not immediately.

170
00:12:03,588 --> 00:12:07,950
It's not time for his run.

171
00:12:23,372 --> 00:12:24,512
Happy Happy
New Year! New Year!

172
00:12:24,532 --> 00:12:25,680
How Good
are you? morning!

173
00:12:27,457 --> 00:12:28,598
He's strange.

174
00:12:29,308 --> 00:12:33,977
I'm not going to beat around the
bush, we've received sad news.

175
00:12:34,613 --> 00:12:37,496
Claire was found dead this morning.

176
00:12:51,823 --> 00:12:52,902
Well?

177
00:12:52,903 --> 00:12:54,331
Pythagoras' theorem.

178
00:12:54,332 --> 00:12:57,307
It's not funny, she's dead.

179
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:01,039
I'm looking for her cell phone; because

180
00:13:01,978 --> 00:13:03,353
she didn't have it.

181
00:13:06,376 --> 00:13:09,345
Nice photo.

182
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:11,654
Who is it?

183
00:13:11,655 --> 00:13:15,068
Her boyfriend, Jules Tivner.

184
00:13:17,765 --> 00:13:18,929
Super.

185
00:13:21,953 --> 00:13:23,461
That poster.

186
00:13:23,726 --> 00:13:27,122
It's about changing the environment.
A nice kid.

187
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:30,526
What was her trip: wildlife, climate?

188
00:13:30,533 --> 00:13:34,525
She had a webpage denouncing
polluters and hunters.

189
00:13:35,433 --> 00:13:38,382
She got threats.
- Yeah? What kind?

190
00:13:38,383 --> 00:13:40,581
"watch out for hunting accidents."

191
00:13:40,582 --> 00:13:42,255
Did you report them?

192
00:13:42,256 --> 00:13:44,234
A complaint, but there was
no follow-up.

193
00:13:46,601 --> 00:13:48,374
What did you find?
- Nothing.

194
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:54,436
Shit. Her password, do you have it?

195
00:13:54,642 --> 00:13:59,361
Date of birth?
- No, that never works.

196
00:13:59,821 --> 00:14:01,930
You always spoil the fun.

197
00:14:02,657 --> 00:14:04,203
What's her date of birth?

198
00:14:04,204 --> 00:14:05,343
May 5, 2004.

199
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,521
"May 5, 2004."

200
00:14:07,522 --> 00:14:08,931
Tap-tap.

201
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:10,276
It doesn't work.

202
00:14:17,634 --> 00:14:19,196
What's that?

203
00:14:21,811 --> 00:14:23,332
It's for you.

204
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:27,658
My birthday is soon.
- Happy birthday.

205
00:14:30,207 --> 00:14:32,606
What is it?
- A mute;

206
00:14:35,513 --> 00:14:37,506
I play the trumpet.

207
00:14:37,507 --> 00:14:38,959
I'm starting out, and I was scared

208
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,983
of disturbing her when she
was studying.

209
00:14:46,431 --> 00:14:47,478
Thank you.

210
00:14:55,889 --> 00:14:59,186
The neighbor at #36 offered to help.

211
00:14:59,528 --> 00:15:02,331
Madam Principal.
How are you?

212
00:15:02,646 --> 00:15:05,239
Your opinion of Mr. Murat?

213
00:15:05,314 --> 00:15:06,572
Yannick Murat?

214
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,560
Your stepdaughter's homeroom teacher.

215
00:15:08,594 --> 00:15:11,235
That's his name, Murat?
- What did you say?

216
00:15:11,743 --> 00:15:13,517
What'd he say? He just said:

217
00:15:13,518 --> 00:15:17,953
"One day my daughter started to
skip Mr. Murat's classes

218
00:15:17,954 --> 00:15:21,305
and changed her major." Why,
Madam Principal?

219
00:15:21,306 --> 00:15:23,069
She liked many subjects.

220
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,374
When so close to a degree?

221
00:15:25,545 --> 00:15:27,490
I'll bring the coffees.

222
00:15:31,183 --> 00:15:35,065
She wanted to change majors, or
change teachers?

223
00:15:35,066 --> 00:15:36,896
He didn't kill her.

224
00:15:36,897 --> 00:15:39,443
They threatened her.

225
00:15:39,614 --> 00:15:42,943
Yes, we'll look at that.
Look into it, will you?

226
00:15:42,944 --> 00:15:46,058
Someone broke a windowpane in the
middle of the night.

227
00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:47,573
It's linked.

228
00:15:47,574 --> 00:15:49,813
It has to be linked, yeah? Yeah.

229
00:15:49,998 --> 00:15:51,912
Where can we see Mr. Murat?

230
00:15:59,605 --> 00:16:01,283
ELECTIONS, NOT WORDS

231
00:16:01,284 --> 00:16:03,237
NO TO THE AGRICULTURE
SCHOOL EXPANSION

232
00:16:03,238 --> 00:16:05,032
"No to the high
school expansion."

233
00:16:05,033 --> 00:16:06,746
Neither god nor mistress!

234
00:16:06,747 --> 00:16:08,341
That's cool. Who lives there?

235
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:11,247
Rufus? He's just a complainer.

236
00:16:11,248 --> 00:16:12,299
Yeah?

237
00:16:16,395 --> 00:16:18,410
DU MONCEAU AGRICULTURAL
HIGH SCHOOL OF BLOIS

238
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,429
Where are his students?

239
00:16:26,856 --> 00:16:29,810
You can expect anything with him.
- Everything?

240
00:16:30,341 --> 00:16:32,278
He has his style, his method.

241
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:35,381
He's holding class outside.
- OK.

242
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:40,270
Normally, a lecture
is masterfully boring.

243
00:16:40,889 --> 00:16:43,311
The day before yesterday they
slept in the forest.

244
00:16:43,756 --> 00:16:46,021
The state forest, over there?

245
00:16:46,184 --> 00:16:50,075
For some parents, it opens the
door to abuses.

246
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:52,068
But we need teachers like him

247
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:54,686
who encourage independence and
strong friendships.

248
00:16:54,687 --> 00:16:56,435
It takes everything.

249
00:16:56,436 --> 00:16:58,931
It's the forest where we found
your step-daughter.

250
00:17:07,536 --> 00:17:10,549
What are you doing?
- Well, I'm digging.

251
00:17:11,934 --> 00:17:14,779
"Are your friends green?"
"Will it go green?"

252
00:17:15,009 --> 00:17:17,195
Your life goes on, but

253
00:17:17,196 --> 00:17:19,767
but without forgetting Claire's memory.

254
00:17:20,276 --> 00:17:22,875
It's like this mimosa:

255
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:25,394
perennial, vital.

256
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,297
Who could have killed her?

257
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:31,307
If they come back, I'm here.

258
00:17:31,308 --> 00:17:33,916
It's too late.
- No, Jules.

259
00:17:34,181 --> 00:17:37,236
Would Claire want us to forget
about her murderer?

260
00:17:37,237 --> 00:17:39,551
Let justice be done.
- It's warm.

261
00:17:41,888 --> 00:17:43,122
Good morning all.

262
00:17:43,803 --> 00:17:46,226
We're creating a support group.

263
00:17:46,227 --> 00:17:47,897
No need.

264
00:17:47,898 --> 00:17:50,102
Maybe not you, but your friends-

265
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:52,520
He's right, we have Yannick.

266
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:55,067
Who's Jules?
- That's me.

267
00:17:55,068 --> 00:17:58,498
Can we talk?
- Don't harass him.

268
00:17:58,499 --> 00:17:59,817
"Justice," your word.

269
00:18:00,077 --> 00:18:02,570
Let's talk about harassment, Professor-?

270
00:18:02,571 --> 00:18:03,749
Murat.

271
00:18:03,906 --> 00:18:04,938
Come.

272
00:18:05,831 --> 00:18:08,409
Come on; I'm not gonna eat you.

273
00:18:09,261 --> 00:18:12,026
You're wrong, she was just
a friend.

274
00:18:12,093 --> 00:18:14,156
Yeah?
- Yeah.

275
00:18:14,398 --> 00:18:17,695
What do you want?
- Her phone.

276
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:19,992
It's not here.
- No?

277
00:18:19,993 --> 00:18:22,006
Welcome to my home.

278
00:18:25,485 --> 00:18:26,730
That's it.

279
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:29,622
And not her phone?
- No...

280
00:18:29,982 --> 00:18:32,536
Your desk?
- Yes.

281
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:36,302
Well then!

282
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,239
There you both are.

283
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,660
And a boyfriend?

284
00:18:40,674 --> 00:18:43,916
Where were you last night?
- In bed, ask my roommates.

285
00:18:44,197 --> 00:18:47,095
If we go out, we write it down.

286
00:18:48,048 --> 00:18:49,368
The rules!

287
00:18:50,345 --> 00:18:53,423
I know, I would sneak out too.

288
00:18:54,838 --> 00:18:57,978
How come your girlfriend left
Murat's class?

289
00:18:57,979 --> 00:19:00,333
She said nothing to me.
- <i>Diony.</i>

290
00:19:00,888 --> 00:19:03,569
She hadn't spoken to you

291
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:06,241
about Murat: your good master,
your "precious"?

292
00:19:06,242 --> 00:19:09,101
Our "guru"? You all say that.

293
00:19:09,102 --> 00:19:10,215
Is that so?

294
00:19:11,315 --> 00:19:13,205
And who says that?

295
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,189
He treats us all like adults.

296
00:19:16,331 --> 00:19:18,292
You aren't yet.

297
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,706
Well done! 4 for her first schedule.

298
00:19:36,707 --> 00:19:39,144
Why did she change major? What
happened between you?

299
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:41,330
Stop your innuendo.

300
00:19:41,331 --> 00:19:43,660
You're too close to them!

301
00:19:44,824 --> 00:19:46,621
I killed her, is that what you think?

302
00:19:46,622 --> 00:19:48,471
And what I did-

303
00:19:48,472 --> 00:19:50,646
Whoa! Four hours of detention I'm

304
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,252
I'm giving you, let me watch.
- Good morning.

305
00:19:52,253 --> 00:19:54,190
Phil Bernadet, a professor.

306
00:19:54,565 --> 00:19:56,471
Mr. Murat is paranoid, yeah?

307
00:19:56,472 --> 00:19:59,639
Well, paranoids often have
good reason to be.

308
00:20:00,941 --> 00:20:04,371
Did Claire's departure surprise you?

309
00:20:04,372 --> 00:20:07,765
I said nothing.
- Where are you going?

310
00:20:07,766 --> 00:20:09,596
A class, it seems.

311
00:20:11,056 --> 00:20:12,361
Hold hold hold;

312
00:20:12,362 --> 00:20:16,056
I'm working too, even if you
can't see it.

313
00:20:16,525 --> 00:20:19,994
Listen, Claire was a passionate,
endearing student

314
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,954
who was brilliant but unpredictable.

315
00:20:22,993 --> 00:20:28,110
Unpredictable doesn't rhyme
with "controlled."

316
00:20:28,674 --> 00:20:30,885
So you know my nickname, "the guru."

317
00:20:30,886 --> 00:20:34,969
The origin of "guru" is "guide,"
a teacher.

318
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:38,803
A good teacher is the one who
knows nothing precisely.

319
00:20:38,841 --> 00:20:42,132
Where were you last night between
10 pm and midnight?

320
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:43,671
At mine.

321
00:20:44,147 --> 00:20:45,631
Is there a witness?

322
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,640
No.
- That's stupid.

323
00:20:48,224 --> 00:20:49,427
That's how it is!

324
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,366
Yes, but it's stupid.
- You asked.

325
00:21:25,694 --> 00:21:26,835
Maude? It's me.

326
00:21:26,836 --> 00:21:29,969
I'm coming home.
<i>- Tell me frankly:</i>

327
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:33,955
did you ever suspect Murat of
inappropriate behavior?

328
00:21:34,206 --> 00:21:37,050
Never.
- Who's speaking, the stepmother

329
00:21:37,534 --> 00:21:40,362
or the principal protecting her
school's reputation?

330
00:21:40,363 --> 00:21:42,089
<i>Your wife.</i>

331
00:21:59,357 --> 00:22:00,709
How's your investigation?

332
00:22:00,981 --> 00:22:04,028
I'm not idle, with 492 students.

333
00:22:04,029 --> 00:22:05,512
Talk to Rufus.

334
00:22:05,513 --> 00:22:08,311
Rufus? The nutcase?
- He threatened

335
00:22:08,312 --> 00:22:11,451
a friend with a knife.
- Yeah? Why?

336
00:22:11,452 --> 00:22:13,689
We were crossing his land,
it's a shortcut.

337
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:16,620
Yeah; that's not stupid.

338
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,557
Thanks for the tip, honey!

339
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:21,963
NO TO THE AGRICULTURE

340
00:22:21,964 --> 00:22:23,939
SCHOOL EXPANSION

341
00:22:34,445 --> 00:22:37,179
ACTION

342
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:41,067
"Elections, not words."
He's not wrong.

343
00:22:41,637 --> 00:22:42,933
SOLIDARITY LIBERTY The
ECOLOGY REVOLUTION revolutionary!

344
00:22:42,934 --> 00:22:44,378
MILITIA EVERYWHERE The
JUSTICE NOWHERE revolutionary!

345
00:22:44,379 --> 00:22:46,278
With his big barracks!

346
00:22:46,636 --> 00:22:50,152
Sol-i-dar-i-ty with
pen-si-o-ners!

347
00:22:50,605 --> 00:22:53,136
"Militia everywhere, justice nowhere!"

348
00:22:53,855 --> 00:22:55,549
All the "autographs."

349
00:22:55,995 --> 00:22:57,113
Anybody there?

350
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,273
Ho!

351
00:23:06,495 --> 00:23:07,698
Anyone?

352
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:09,182
Whoa!

353
00:23:09,183 --> 00:23:12,729
What do you want?
- Hey-I'm the heat!

354
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:15,845
I didn't see.
- Thanks for the welcome?

355
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:21,281
Is it OK you bomb people, like
a wingless plane?

356
00:23:21,282 --> 00:23:23,829
I was kidding.

357
00:23:24,206 --> 00:23:26,624
High fashion humor?

358
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:28,948
And the knife kids say you had,
that was for laughs too?

359
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,693
Well, it wasn't funny.

360
00:23:30,694 --> 00:23:35,215
But they hit me on the noggin with
their two-wheelers.

361
00:23:35,216 --> 00:23:37,350
I wouldn't have hurt them.

362
00:23:38,403 --> 00:23:41,060
Coffee?
- I wouldn't mind one.

363
00:23:41,913 --> 00:23:44,405
And better than at "the
warden's", huh?

364
00:23:44,624 --> 00:23:47,439
Is she the one who ratted me out?

365
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,033
Pfft, not even.

366
00:23:49,408 --> 00:23:52,705
Look: not the biggest.
- Not the smallest.

367
00:23:52,706 --> 00:23:54,971
Put yourself in my place.
- Show me.

368
00:23:57,315 --> 00:23:59,088
You don't like the school.

369
00:23:59,089 --> 00:24:04,451
It's been 15 years since they built it

370
00:24:04,452 --> 00:24:05,694
on unbuildable land.

371
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:06,834
What a crock!

372
00:24:07,088 --> 00:24:09,166
It's not common, believe it
if you want,

373
00:24:09,167 --> 00:24:10,612
if you know what I mean.

374
00:24:10,613 --> 00:24:12,604
I wanted to ask if you know her,

375
00:24:12,605 --> 00:24:16,307
the little one: "Rosa Luxembourg."

376
00:24:16,308 --> 00:24:17,385
Yes? No?

377
00:24:17,386 --> 00:24:19,949
You're here because you were
told about a knife?

378
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:22,489
No, for the wolf in the sheep fold

379
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:25,323
who killed this sheep, this morning.

380
00:24:25,324 --> 00:24:27,632
Never seen her in my life.

381
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:29,268
Yeah? Swear?
- Swear.

382
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:30,542
You're sure?

383
00:24:30,543 --> 00:24:33,142
The fantasy:

384
00:24:33,143 --> 00:24:37,268
Rufus the sociopath, the marginalized.

385
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:40,346
The psychopath. It's real life.

386
00:24:40,442 --> 00:24:43,020
"There is never anything left of
the lived experience."

387
00:24:43,021 --> 00:24:45,481
"Some grain will oxidize its paraffin."

388
00:24:45,482 --> 00:24:46,864
Yes, Castel. What's the matter?

389
00:24:46,865 --> 00:24:50,832
The young girl and Murat weren't
just teacher and student.

390
00:24:51,028 --> 00:24:52,747
Listen to what she sent him:

391
00:24:52,748 --> 00:24:54,536
<i>We think alike.</i>

392
00:24:54,594 --> 00:24:57,126
<i>But you started earlier.</i>

393
00:24:57,167 --> 00:24:58,854
<i>And it's as if</i>

394
00:24:59,493 --> 00:25:01,430
<i>you waited for me.</i>
- Fuck.

395
00:25:05,584 --> 00:25:06,764
What are you doing?

396
00:25:06,895 --> 00:25:07,973
Come on!

397
00:25:08,213 --> 00:25:09,632
Yeah yeah yeah.
- Let go of me!

398
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:10,922
Leave him alone!

399
00:25:10,923 --> 00:25:12,184
It's fine!

400
00:25:12,526 --> 00:25:14,034
Don't worry!

401
00:25:15,901 --> 00:25:17,471
You have to calm down!

402
00:25:18,384 --> 00:25:19,556
So...

403
00:25:19,932 --> 00:25:21,776
Kids!

404
00:25:25,144 --> 00:25:27,348
<i>And it's as if</i>

405
00:25:27,673 --> 00:25:29,275
<i>you had waited for me.</i>

406
00:25:31,713 --> 00:25:33,010
<i>You're right.</i>

407
00:25:33,137 --> 00:25:36,840
<i>Everything will change. Those able
to adapt will survive.</i>

408
00:25:37,939 --> 00:25:39,337
<i>Nothing will last.</i>

409
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:42,619
<i>Let's live the present together.</i>

410
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:45,373
I saw those videos.

411
00:25:47,066 --> 00:25:48,550
<i>I'm not afraid of the night,</i>

412
00:25:48,551 --> 00:25:50,469
<i>of the sun.</i>

413
00:25:50,553 --> 00:25:54,498
<i>I'm not afraid of your body that
envelops me to disappear.</i>

414
00:25:55,024 --> 00:25:57,087
<i>I'm afraid of myself-</i>
- Goodbye!

415
00:25:58,019 --> 00:26:02,113
It's a personality cult. A real Stalin!

416
00:26:02,153 --> 00:26:08,107
It wasn't for me.
- Yes? Why didn't you tell me?

417
00:26:08,269 --> 00:26:12,629
Out of respect for Claire, to preserve
her privacy.

418
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:18,682
Like Stalin, Mao:
protector of youth.

419
00:26:18,897 --> 00:26:22,600
And why did this young girl skip
your classes?

420
00:26:22,728 --> 00:26:25,370
I wanted to explain to her

421
00:26:25,371 --> 00:26:28,378
she was confusing love and
admiration.

422
00:26:28,424 --> 00:26:29,690
Poor kid,

423
00:26:29,808 --> 00:26:31,968
she declared her feelings and got
a punch in the nose.

424
00:26:31,988 --> 00:26:33,796
It must have been awkward.

425
00:26:33,939 --> 00:26:38,744
She was mortified, she felt belittled.

426
00:26:38,745 --> 00:26:45,001
You might have stopped
the thing from the outset.

427
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:47,430
I should have.
- "I should have."

428
00:26:47,729 --> 00:26:49,292
Yes, but it's so easy

429
00:26:49,293 --> 00:26:53,745
to impress a teen when you're
her father's age.

430
00:26:53,746 --> 00:26:56,024
and take advantage
of the kid maybe.

431
00:26:56,025 --> 00:26:58,231
No way, I never took "advantage."

432
00:26:58,232 --> 00:27:00,057
Never?

433
00:27:00,348 --> 00:27:04,208
A teacher-student relationship is
never equal to equal.

434
00:27:04,446 --> 00:27:06,954
The adult has authority.

435
00:27:06,962 --> 00:27:10,119
It was up to you to quickly say Stop.

436
00:27:10,126 --> 00:27:13,149
I chose to ignore her messages.

437
00:27:14,002 --> 00:27:15,892
So that she would get tired of it.

438
00:27:16,418 --> 00:27:17,566
That's it.

439
00:27:18,548 --> 00:27:22,838
You wanted to play Nabokov by
Lolita-ing the kid.

440
00:27:23,523 --> 00:27:26,789
And then make a date that goes wrong.
- No.

441
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:27,788
No?
- No!

442
00:27:27,808 --> 00:27:30,781
You wouldn't be the first.
- Good. anyway-

443
00:27:32,256 --> 00:27:35,678
for the lie by omission we'll put
0 out of 20. OK?

444
00:27:35,825 --> 00:27:38,284
Get me my stuff.
- Stuff...

445
00:27:38,285 --> 00:27:44,705
Yeah, we're going to sample your DNA
and compare it with hers.

446
00:27:45,008 --> 00:27:46,704
<i>Voila.</i> Thank you so much.

447
00:27:46,705 --> 00:27:49,633
Mouth open-MOUTH OPEN!

448
00:27:51,363 --> 00:27:53,746
Close your eyes, it will slide in better.

449
00:27:53,747 --> 00:27:54,840
There!

450
00:27:56,382 --> 00:27:59,513
No, not in there, it's too small.

451
00:28:00,062 --> 00:28:02,040
He'll fit. Go on!

452
00:28:03,735 --> 00:28:05,305
Watch your hands!

453
00:28:08,141 --> 00:28:11,492
It won't do to lash out at my colleague.

454
00:28:11,493 --> 00:28:13,585
It's nothing to do with him.

455
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:15,517
Hey, give me that scarf.

456
00:28:15,951 --> 00:28:17,646
We're not playing Hangman.

457
00:28:17,906 --> 00:28:19,875
And forget the coffee.

458
00:28:19,876 --> 00:28:21,289
Put that away.

459
00:28:23,649 --> 00:28:25,071
A complete map...

460
00:28:30,911 --> 00:28:32,677
We need to trace the guy.

461
00:28:32,921 --> 00:28:35,530
I've received the geolocation data
on her phone.

462
00:28:35,531 --> 00:28:39,482
So?
- No connection with Murat.

463
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:44,455
You're a pessimist, you know that?

464
00:28:45,022 --> 00:28:46,593
No? Me neither.

465
00:28:56,585 --> 00:29:00,979
This is the last sector where her
phone pinged.

466
00:29:02,286 --> 00:29:04,474
Let's go around the corner.
- Yes.

467
00:29:04,497 --> 00:29:08,809
Question the locals. Considering
everything, it will go quickly.

468
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:12,294
I'll come back for you.
- Where are you going?

469
00:29:12,295 --> 00:29:13,871
You do your sector,

470
00:29:13,872 --> 00:29:15,833
I'll do the penultimate one where
she last texted.

471
00:29:15,834 --> 00:29:17,287
Thank you, nice.

472
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:20,544
Walking will do you good.
- Sure.

473
00:29:21,114 --> 00:29:22,793
Going... and: bye.

474
00:29:55,561 --> 00:29:57,607
Sir! Gendarmerie.

475
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,803
What are you doing here?

476
00:30:03,053 --> 00:30:04,333
I live there.

477
00:30:04,334 --> 00:30:05,895
In there?
- Yes.

478
00:30:06,201 --> 00:30:08,990
Teacher salaries have gone down?

479
00:30:09,733 --> 00:30:11,608
Good smell!

480
00:30:12,038 --> 00:30:13,226
It's compost.

481
00:30:15,928 --> 00:30:18,326
Corpse compost, does that
work too?

482
00:30:19,763 --> 00:30:23,607
In the USA they're going to
legalize it.

483
00:30:24,076 --> 00:30:27,545
Big business, huh?

484
00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:30,130
I'm here because

485
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:36,294
my colleagues tell me Claire's phone
pinged around here yesterday.

486
00:30:36,349 --> 00:30:37,903
Yes, I saw her.

487
00:30:38,654 --> 00:30:41,850
That's why. What did she want?

488
00:30:42,693 --> 00:30:45,912
Well, advice.
- About?

489
00:30:46,115 --> 00:30:50,264
She changed major and had
fallen behind.

490
00:30:51,326 --> 00:30:53,662
She wanted to talk to me about it.
- Yes, I understand.

491
00:30:54,317 --> 00:30:55,609
I understand.

492
00:30:56,201 --> 00:30:59,053
So, suddenly: bang!

493
00:31:00,521 --> 00:31:04,193
You went into this RV to discuss

494
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:06,538
something special with her?

495
00:31:06,646 --> 00:31:08,537
Are you kidding?

496
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,583
I only know the students in
my class.

497
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:14,639
Yeah, why I'm looking for you.

498
00:31:15,326 --> 00:31:19,287
Well then; what happened?

499
00:31:20,419 --> 00:31:24,303
Nothing. She didn't insist, and left.

500
00:31:24,304 --> 00:31:25,658
She left...

501
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:28,955
Who are you calling?

502
00:31:28,956 --> 00:31:30,025
A colleague.

503
00:31:30,056 --> 00:31:32,181
To search down to your skin.

504
00:31:32,354 --> 00:31:33,800
Yeah, it's me!

505
00:31:33,889 --> 00:31:36,421
We're going to do a search.

506
00:31:36,725 --> 00:31:40,756
It's an RV. Bring 2 or 3 people.

507
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:43,397
Yeah. No, the man is scared.

508
00:31:43,398 --> 00:31:46,187
You're the last to have seen her,

509
00:31:46,188 --> 00:31:47,789
we have to.

510
00:31:48,472 --> 00:31:49,660
Go on, ciao.

511
00:31:50,105 --> 00:31:51,175
Coffee?

512
00:32:04,003 --> 00:32:05,972
Here you are!

513
00:32:05,973 --> 00:32:09,066
Sorry, Captain.
- It's over there. Chop-chop!

514
00:32:09,067 --> 00:32:11,466
A call. Who's calling me?

515
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,987
Eh?

516
00:32:13,036 --> 00:32:15,232
Well? A date, Oscar?

517
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:20,515
Glass dust and a shard in
her left arch.

518
00:32:20,516 --> 00:32:24,263
She may have fallen on broken glass.

519
00:32:24,264 --> 00:32:28,945
It remains to be seen if it's
glass for food...

520
00:32:28,946 --> 00:32:31,216
Elementary, my dear Oscar.

521
00:32:31,318 --> 00:32:33,912
...or glass from a building.

522
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,955
Thanks, honey. Ciao.

523
00:32:38,472 --> 00:32:39,764
What?

524
00:32:41,517 --> 00:32:43,767
Prepared to lose?
- And you?

525
00:32:43,768 --> 00:32:45,993
Ha, that's my business.

526
00:32:45,994 --> 00:32:47,454
I'm a teacher.

527
00:32:47,494 --> 00:32:51,158
In my job reputations are fragile,
when the knives come out.

528
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:52,229
Yeah?

529
00:32:52,697 --> 00:32:55,103
Did Murat ever find the knives
were out for him?

530
00:32:56,047 --> 00:32:59,939
Let's say for him gossip was
a way of life.

531
00:33:00,151 --> 00:33:01,565
Or death.

532
00:33:01,658 --> 00:33:03,047
Get a photo there.

533
00:33:03,416 --> 00:33:04,638
There.

534
00:33:05,141 --> 00:33:06,180
Up there.

535
00:33:07,658 --> 00:33:08,951
And one there.

536
00:33:09,025 --> 00:33:13,781
Funny, it smells
like being back in school.

537
00:33:13,782 --> 00:33:17,785
Fresh and clean.
- I clean it every week.

538
00:33:17,786 --> 00:33:19,317
Since the Covid? Yeah...

539
00:33:20,723 --> 00:33:23,676
Sweet!

540
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:26,311
Is it a weapon?

541
00:33:26,312 --> 00:33:27,895
A vacuum.

542
00:33:27,896 --> 00:33:30,795
Yeah, very good! Gregory,
take a picture.

543
00:33:31,875 --> 00:33:33,477
So; boring.

544
00:33:34,133 --> 00:33:37,289
Big and boring.

545
00:33:38,938 --> 00:33:40,625
Where does he think he is?

546
00:33:41,031 --> 00:33:42,102
No!

547
00:33:47,265 --> 00:33:48,351
Stop!

548
00:33:48,438 --> 00:33:50,250
Yeah what?

549
00:33:51,281 --> 00:33:52,602
Yes.
- Yeah?

550
00:33:52,603 --> 00:33:53,764
Let me...

551
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:56,047
Not his fingerprints?

552
00:33:56,539 --> 00:33:58,414
Or his DNA?

553
00:33:58,664 --> 00:34:01,617
Why was he as tight as a thong?

554
00:34:02,392 --> 00:34:04,025
We don't know.

555
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,548
Yeah, so long.

556
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:08,797
There you are.

557
00:34:12,193 --> 00:34:13,763
You forgot me.

558
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:17,366
You were to come back.
- I lied.

559
00:34:17,561 --> 00:34:18,647
Anything new?

560
00:34:18,648 --> 00:34:20,874
No, it's the middle of nowhere.

561
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:22,935
The farmers saw nothing.

562
00:34:24,107 --> 00:34:26,849
We're not going to get there.

563
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:29,491
Do you know the Coue method?

564
00:34:29,775 --> 00:34:30,876
Coue?
- Yes.

565
00:34:30,877 --> 00:34:32,771
"Repeat after me" -

566
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:34,897
We...
- We...

567
00:34:34,904 --> 00:34:36,841
Articulate! We...
- We.

568
00:34:36,842 --> 00:34:38,364
Going...
- Going.

569
00:34:38,365 --> 00:34:39,623
We are going...
- To get there?

570
00:34:39,624 --> 00:34:41,397
How did you know?

571
00:34:41,398 --> 00:34:43,002
You think it's funny?

572
00:34:43,413 --> 00:34:44,913
Me, I found that.

573
00:34:45,366 --> 00:34:48,146
In the records at Menard.

574
00:34:48,147 --> 00:34:50,881
His little Achilles heel.
- Open!

575
00:34:51,733 --> 00:34:55,116
He's just yelling. It starts to annoy me.

576
00:34:56,367 --> 00:34:58,156
Open the door.
- Deborah!

577
00:34:59,869 --> 00:35:01,416
Call Ghostbusters!

578
00:35:01,417 --> 00:35:03,908
Nightmares to declare?

579
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,955
What now?

580
00:35:05,956 --> 00:35:10,135
Who is this "Deborah" you've been
yelling for?

581
00:35:10,136 --> 00:35:13,292
Deborah Fournier. She has nothing
to do with this.

582
00:35:13,293 --> 00:35:15,635
Were you together?

583
00:35:15,729 --> 00:35:19,049
Not that night.
- So sleep.

584
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:21,423
Go on, shut it. Bye.

585
00:35:30,852 --> 00:35:32,281
VETERINARY CLINIC

586
00:35:32,524 --> 00:35:34,633
See you in 2 days.

587
00:35:34,634 --> 00:35:36,575
Thank you.
- Bye.

588
00:35:40,051 --> 00:35:41,142
Madam.

589
00:35:41,143 --> 00:35:42,604
These biscuits are good!

590
00:35:42,605 --> 00:35:46,143
Gendarmerie, I need to talk.
- I have nothing to hide.

591
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,198
Sure? OK.

592
00:35:48,232 --> 00:35:50,521
Your sexual intercourse
with Mr. Murat:

593
00:35:50,522 --> 00:35:53,446
how was it? Forceful? Missionary?
Omnipres-

594
00:35:53,447 --> 00:35:55,340
Where is Yannick?

595
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:56,711
Thppt!

596
00:35:58,249 --> 00:36:00,186
Do you know Claire Duret?

597
00:36:01,375 --> 00:36:02,632
Is this about her?

598
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:05,741
I knew her.

599
00:36:05,745 --> 00:36:09,268
From where? How did you meet?
- Thanks to a wild boar.

600
00:36:10,579 --> 00:36:13,440
Claire found him injured in
the forest as a baby.

601
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:17,430
I'm keeping him while waiting to
find a park or a zoo.

602
00:36:17,571 --> 00:36:20,985
Can't keep a wild animal at home.
Did she know that?

603
00:36:20,986 --> 00:36:24,290
I'm being sued. I'll have to
put him down.

604
00:36:24,462 --> 00:36:28,274
Not really!
- If I'm forced to by the court.

605
00:36:28,275 --> 00:36:33,031
He's beautiful! Caring for beautiful
beasts is proof you're human.

606
00:36:33,312 --> 00:36:34,945
Claire must have loved it.

607
00:36:34,946 --> 00:36:38,507
To her it was a forest creature,
she wanted to find a specialist lawyer.

608
00:36:38,508 --> 00:36:41,360
To her this animal symbolized anti-hunting.

609
00:36:41,517 --> 00:36:44,618
But hunters are also your customers.

610
00:36:44,706 --> 00:36:47,230
Voices were raised, you fought...

611
00:36:47,231 --> 00:36:48,331
What are you suggesting?

612
00:36:48,337 --> 00:36:53,064
You're right. Chicks aren't going to
fight over a wild pig.

613
00:36:53,065 --> 00:36:55,815
But a human pig? A guy, for example.

614
00:36:55,816 --> 00:36:56,995
What guy?

615
00:36:56,996 --> 00:36:59,957
Yes, she adored Mr. Murat.

616
00:37:00,445 --> 00:37:03,907
He didn't tell you! Damn that's stupid.

617
00:37:03,908 --> 00:37:08,316
A girl in love with a teacher, how boring.

618
00:37:08,987 --> 00:37:10,966
Boring to death.

619
00:37:11,078 --> 00:37:14,031
Where were you Tuesday night?

620
00:37:14,381 --> 00:37:17,131
Only here, a post-operative followup.

621
00:37:17,132 --> 00:37:19,474
Forget about the patient's testimony:

622
00:37:19,475 --> 00:37:21,842
a high-strung Malinois.

623
00:37:21,847 --> 00:37:25,074
A Malinois who thinks he's <i>mal!</i>

624
00:37:26,402 --> 00:37:30,496
She doesn't like pig jokes.
Do you like them?

625
00:37:30,497 --> 00:37:34,843
You have a beautiful chapka. We're cousins!

626
00:38:02,542 --> 00:38:03,683
Come on, move.

627
00:38:06,491 --> 00:38:07,686
Dammit.

628
00:38:10,275 --> 00:38:13,438
Christophe, can you get the door for me?

629
00:38:13,628 --> 00:38:15,643
Take off my glasses;

630
00:38:15,644 --> 00:38:17,619
put them in my car.

631
00:38:19,147 --> 00:38:20,718
How are you, Brian?

632
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:23,270
Be proud of me.
- Why?

633
00:38:23,271 --> 00:38:26,664
I've become optimistic.
- You're worrying me.

634
00:38:26,665 --> 00:38:30,017
I dug elsewhere.
- Your grave?

635
00:38:30,018 --> 00:38:33,945
About the vet-
- Well?

636
00:38:34,607 --> 00:38:39,535
She's the daughter of a farmers
market couple who, 40 years ago-

637
00:38:39,536 --> 00:38:42,133
Kidnapped a child.

638
00:38:42,134 --> 00:38:43,090
Not pretty.

639
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:47,376
Guess the baby's first name.
- Alexis?

640
00:38:48,266 --> 00:38:49,992
Yannick.
- What?

641
00:38:49,993 --> 00:38:51,106
Yannick!

642
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:53,868
Yannick, as in-
- Shh, shh.

643
00:38:53,869 --> 00:38:54,875
OK.

644
00:38:54,876 --> 00:38:57,211
At the time he was called

645
00:38:57,867 --> 00:38:59,547
Yannick Le Sommer.

646
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:02,333
Summer, as in Donna? Not bad.

647
00:39:02,383 --> 00:39:04,668
Look at this. Pardon me.

648
00:39:04,931 --> 00:39:06,743
Hey, my coffees!

649
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,449
It's him?

650
00:39:14,777 --> 00:39:15,884
"Legal emancipation

651
00:39:15,904 --> 00:39:18,741
at 16 years old, change of surname."

652
00:39:18,742 --> 00:39:22,581
"For legitimate reason." Article 61
of the Civil Code.

653
00:39:23,115 --> 00:39:26,885
Clever you. Didn't he want his
parents' name?

654
00:39:27,074 --> 00:39:29,887
They forgot him in a parking lot.
- No!

655
00:39:29,888 --> 00:39:32,459
Where he was kidnapped.

656
00:39:40,846 --> 00:39:42,952
Come and eat.

657
00:39:42,953 --> 00:39:45,291
Open it up.
- Where are we going?

658
00:39:45,292 --> 00:39:47,154
Not where I expected.

659
00:39:47,666 --> 00:39:49,845
I'm not carrying this alone.

660
00:39:50,191 --> 00:39:51,374
No, but how!

661
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:04,647
Does it remind you of anything?

662
00:40:06,156 --> 00:40:07,401
No?

663
00:40:14,107 --> 00:40:16,052
Yeah, so open the door.

664
00:40:16,098 --> 00:40:17,161
Come on.

665
00:40:20,456 --> 00:40:23,226
What does this have to do with
Claire's death?

666
00:40:23,511 --> 00:40:25,550
I don't know, let's look.

667
00:40:28,645 --> 00:40:31,400
Give me a hand with your foot.

668
00:40:33,476 --> 00:40:34,651
There we go.

669
00:40:50,312 --> 00:40:53,829
This is where they chained
and gagged me.

670
00:40:54,066 --> 00:40:55,598
I thought I was dying.

671
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,780
Hence the claustrophobia.

672
00:41:01,295 --> 00:41:03,834
Your parents would've paid
the ransom?

673
00:41:04,272 --> 00:41:08,325
Sure, to give themselves a
clear conscience.

674
00:41:08,326 --> 00:41:10,731
Because I didn't exist for them.

675
00:41:10,886 --> 00:41:15,127
Well, I'm surprised, crazy
people leaving a

676
00:41:15,128 --> 00:41:18,218
7-year-old kid, by the highway,
is beyond the pale.

677
00:41:18,852 --> 00:41:22,437
So a farm couple,

678
00:41:23,757 --> 00:41:28,016
so nice, "Sure, we'll take you to
your mom and dad."

679
00:41:28,664 --> 00:41:29,945
I followed them.

680
00:41:31,615 --> 00:41:35,425
They were broke, I was manna
from heaven.

681
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:36,973
Amen.

682
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:46,829
I ran away into the forest.

683
00:41:47,225 --> 00:41:49,858
Is there a reason you didn't
come back?

684
00:41:49,859 --> 00:41:54,364
A place became available at
the agriculture college, like a sign.

685
00:41:54,381 --> 00:41:57,271
I was a teacher, I never returned.

686
00:41:57,975 --> 00:42:00,848
Out of fear.
- Of the kidnappers?

687
00:42:00,856 --> 00:42:02,442
No, they're dead.

688
00:42:03,016 --> 00:42:04,234
Yes, good.

689
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,693
But you attracted their daughter.

690
00:42:07,694 --> 00:42:11,640
Deborah; raised by a foster family.
- Yeah.

691
00:42:12,624 --> 00:42:15,843
We had crappy parents in common.

692
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,056
A good basis for a relationship.

693
00:42:22,881 --> 00:42:26,364
You know that "80% of abusive adults

694
00:42:26,365 --> 00:42:28,653
suffered child abuse."

695
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:31,000
And you suspect me.

696
00:42:31,076 --> 00:42:33,772
There's resilience too, though.
A strength.

697
00:42:34,038 --> 00:42:39,617
And then there's...
- Umm... my DNA?

698
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:42,987
You're lucky, there was none on Claire.

699
00:42:43,571 --> 00:42:46,567
It's better for you. Let's go.

700
00:43:13,572 --> 00:43:15,771
Something happened. A gendarme
came by.

701
00:43:15,772 --> 00:43:17,967
She's on my back.

702
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:22,926
Why?
- Because of the videos.

703
00:43:22,927 --> 00:43:25,403
No, keep it open, I need to breathe.

704
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:27,503
What videos?

705
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:30,950
You know how she was:
passionate, excessive.

706
00:43:30,951 --> 00:43:32,086
Romantic.

707
00:43:32,446 --> 00:43:34,441
I tried to explain to her she
mixed up everything.

708
00:43:34,442 --> 00:43:36,254
but she wouldn't let it go.

709
00:43:36,255 --> 00:43:38,200
What's that look?
- You slept with her.

710
00:43:38,462 --> 00:43:39,571
With Claire?

711
00:43:39,899 --> 00:43:41,735
Don't you start!
- Calm down.

712
00:43:42,183 --> 00:43:45,613
Do you know where the gendarme
took me?

713
00:43:45,633 --> 00:43:48,290
Your parents' barn!
- Why?

714
00:43:49,012 --> 00:43:52,271
She thinks I'm twisted, like you!

715
00:43:52,272 --> 00:43:54,699
Stop it.
You know I love you, Yannick.

716
00:44:02,821 --> 00:44:04,587
Captain Marleau?
- There.

717
00:44:18,931 --> 00:44:20,970
Captain? I have a lead for you.

718
00:44:21,579 --> 00:44:25,574
How nice. To stop me suspecting
you, or Mr. Murat?

719
00:44:25,575 --> 00:44:26,819
You're talking shit!

720
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:31,374
You're losing your temper. Sit down,
and no swearing.

721
00:44:31,406 --> 00:44:32,461
Go slowly.

722
00:44:32,625 --> 00:44:35,282
Last year, I reported a case of a spaniel

723
00:44:35,283 --> 00:44:37,432
subjected to extreme violence.

724
00:44:37,433 --> 00:44:41,627
The owner, Raymond Blier, was
fined €30,000.

725
00:44:41,628 --> 00:44:42,809
Son of a him!

726
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:47,154
This guy should serve as a
pharmaceutical lab guinea pig.

727
00:44:47,155 --> 00:44:51,381
His daughter Oriane was in a
class with Claire Duret.

728
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:57,215
And the kid ratted out
the motherfucker?

729
00:44:57,216 --> 00:45:00,644
I got the daughter's account
from her friends,

730
00:45:01,057 --> 00:45:04,534
so I made a report on her behalf.

731
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,877
Shit.
- What?

732
00:45:07,235 --> 00:45:12,797
Raymond Blier is still in prison, with
no release papers.

733
00:45:13,727 --> 00:45:17,243
He wasn't the one who took revenge.
- No.

734
00:45:18,477 --> 00:45:19,821
His daughter?

735
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:25,742
Oriane Blier?

736
00:45:25,743 --> 00:45:26,860
Hey, whoa!

737
00:45:26,861 --> 00:45:29,221
Take it easy with your hammer.

738
00:45:30,744 --> 00:45:33,932
Gendarmerie, like. Do you know
Claire Duret?

739
00:45:34,029 --> 00:45:36,430
My best girlfriend.

740
00:45:36,431 --> 00:45:39,179
Best dead girlfriend.

741
00:45:48,699 --> 00:45:49,949
Where are you?

742
00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:54,388
Already your break?

743
00:45:54,943 --> 00:45:56,763
I'm not talking to a cop.

744
00:45:57,451 --> 00:45:59,849
They've done us enough harm.

745
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:03,443
Well, first we say <i>une</i> cop.

746
00:46:04,186 --> 00:46:10,436
And this cop tells you your father is in
the slammer because of Claire,

747
00:46:10,437 --> 00:46:12,077
who informed on him.

748
00:46:12,428 --> 00:46:16,522
And you left school to work
because of her too.

749
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:17,998
But you know this.

750
00:46:18,737 --> 00:46:24,402
His life went bust, he blames the whole
world for being in jail.

751
00:46:25,269 --> 00:46:28,918
I didn't think she would report him.

752
00:46:28,919 --> 00:46:31,746
You argued?
- Yes.

753
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:35,835
Hence your message: "Watch out
for hunting accidents."

754
00:46:35,866 --> 00:46:37,967
No.
- No? Wasn't that you?

755
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,252
Be careful, because I'll
go check it out.

756
00:46:40,253 --> 00:46:42,387
She was ruining our lives, OK?

757
00:46:43,668 --> 00:46:45,660
My father isn't a sadist.

758
00:46:47,113 --> 00:46:48,753
Claire shouldn't have.

759
00:46:48,754 --> 00:46:51,745
Done what?
- Fling the shit, like.

760
00:46:51,746 --> 00:46:54,700
That motherfucker was hitting his dog!

761
00:46:54,906 --> 00:46:58,140
And you let it happen;

762
00:46:58,251 --> 00:46:59,969
you collaborated.

763
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:01,180
Where were you

764
00:47:01,181 --> 00:47:03,655
Tuesday evening, between 10 pm
and midnight?

765
00:47:04,076 --> 00:47:05,329
Working.

766
00:47:05,903 --> 00:47:09,935
Ask my colleague. 11 hours for
a car rally.

767
00:47:11,966 --> 00:47:13,481
Yeah, I will ask!

768
00:47:13,482 --> 00:47:16,066
That's good! There! Let's go!

769
00:47:16,221 --> 00:47:17,814
He's not bad.

770
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:20,959
We won't have another jerkoff!

771
00:47:21,877 --> 00:47:23,323
Load of manure; come on!

772
00:47:23,526 --> 00:47:25,276
Slack! Slack!

773
00:47:25,301 --> 00:47:27,137
I quit. Sorry.

774
00:47:27,138 --> 00:47:28,379
Why?

775
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:29,945
Are you in the tourney?

776
00:47:29,946 --> 00:47:32,285
To beat Bernardet's team, yes.

777
00:47:32,286 --> 00:47:35,959
Not with us.
- I'm not forcing you.

778
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:36,980
Sorry.

779
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:39,794
They're idiots.
- Well...

780
00:47:40,563 --> 00:47:43,469
Hey! Minds can change!

781
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:47,793
Your guru is a loser,

782
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,473
like Charles Manson.
- Shut up, Fabien!

783
00:47:50,474 --> 00:47:52,938
If you had opened your eyes maybe
your girlfriend wouldn't be dead.

784
00:47:55,708 --> 00:47:58,044
Let him go! Leave him alone!

785
00:47:59,311 --> 00:48:00,949
What'd you do?
Stop.

786
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:03,458
Come to the infirmary.
- I'd rather die!

787
00:48:04,013 --> 00:48:05,247
What a bonehead.

788
00:48:22,174 --> 00:48:23,403
Oriane!

789
00:48:25,639 --> 00:48:28,451
Did the gendarme question you?

790
00:48:28,452 --> 00:48:31,092
What gendarme?
- Come here.

791
00:48:31,771 --> 00:48:33,740
Come see something.

792
00:48:38,466 --> 00:48:39,779
I said nothing.

793
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:43,363
I hope so, for I'd be sad if something
happened

794
00:48:43,364 --> 00:48:46,056
and your dad went back to jail

795
00:48:46,057 --> 00:48:47,691
for his aggression.

796
00:48:48,065 --> 00:48:49,995
I learned some stuff about him
on the Net.

797
00:49:09,073 --> 00:49:11,237
I can do this.
- No, it's fine.

798
00:49:26,386 --> 00:49:27,761
It's so beautiful.

799
00:49:29,963 --> 00:49:32,096
What is it, dear?
- I'm sorry.

800
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:35,458
What is it?
- How could I not see it?

801
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:40,169
It was evident there was a risk of abuse.

802
00:49:43,728 --> 00:49:45,049
What happened between them?

803
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:46,573
What are you talking about?

804
00:49:46,574 --> 00:49:47,589
With Murat.

805
00:49:48,064 --> 00:49:49,720
Nothing, surely.

806
00:50:17,567 --> 00:50:19,981
She preferred acting to complaining.

807
00:50:19,982 --> 00:50:21,528
We must honor her memory, OK?

808
00:50:24,845 --> 00:50:26,502
Jules.
- Let go of me!

809
00:50:26,503 --> 00:50:29,643
Wait; when exactly does this end?
- Drop it.

810
00:50:30,354 --> 00:50:32,956
You know things-
- And you?

811
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:38,271
Mr. Murat!

812
00:50:40,512 --> 00:50:42,715
A teacher is not a friend
or brother.

813
00:50:43,559 --> 00:50:46,832
It's not clear what you are
to kids,

814
00:50:46,833 --> 00:50:48,771
and you didn't help my
daughter's life.

815
00:50:49,051 --> 00:50:50,754
I'll go, Mr. Duret.
- What happened at

816
00:50:50,755 --> 00:50:53,636
your last school? They fired
you, right?

817
00:50:54,115 --> 00:50:57,787
No, I decided to leave.
- Then why are you here?

818
00:50:58,614 --> 00:50:59,914
Get out!

819
00:51:00,294 --> 00:51:01,747
I SAID, GET OUT!

820
00:51:11,087 --> 00:51:12,364
Aiee!

821
00:51:17,444 --> 00:51:18,705
Achoo!

822
00:51:18,749 --> 00:51:19,976
Working overtime?

823
00:51:19,977 --> 00:51:21,522
I'm learning the trade.

824
00:51:23,024 --> 00:51:24,438
What do you want now?

825
00:51:25,637 --> 00:51:27,309
According to your coworkers' statements

826
00:51:27,310 --> 00:51:30,372
you left here at around 2200 hours.

827
00:51:31,609 --> 00:51:34,195
Where were you? Smoke break?
- Yeah.

828
00:51:34,488 --> 00:51:36,340
Did you smoke the whole pack?

829
00:51:36,526 --> 00:51:39,409
Because you were gone

830
00:51:39,652 --> 00:51:42,774
more than 30 minutes.
- OK, I went to the Duret's.

831
00:51:43,134 --> 00:51:45,064
<i>voila!</i>

832
00:51:45,931 --> 00:51:47,384
I'm understanding better.

833
00:51:47,932 --> 00:51:51,292
Did you go to fix their window?

834
00:51:51,970 --> 00:51:54,939
To bury the hatchet.
- Well, Pocahontas;

835
00:51:55,595 --> 00:51:57,220
why didn't you tell me?

836
00:51:58,214 --> 00:52:00,448
There was no one home.

837
00:52:00,464 --> 00:52:02,940
Or she didn't come to the door.

838
00:52:02,987 --> 00:52:04,456
No. She wasn't there.

839
00:52:05,167 --> 00:52:06,307
We're closing.

840
00:52:08,206 --> 00:52:09,249
Well-

841
00:52:09,868 --> 00:52:12,525
What a welcome, thanks!
Are you freaking out?

842
00:52:12,526 --> 00:52:14,982
Or is it my colleague who's scary?

843
00:52:14,983 --> 00:52:17,118
No one scares me, okay?

844
00:52:19,274 --> 00:52:22,110
Let's get off to a good start.
All right?

845
00:52:23,616 --> 00:52:26,070
Claire was your best friend,

846
00:52:26,071 --> 00:52:28,984
she must've told you
about Mr. Murat.

847
00:52:28,985 --> 00:52:29,993
No, never.

848
00:52:33,086 --> 00:52:35,586
What did you think of the "guru"?

849
00:52:37,102 --> 00:52:38,876
He wasn't my teacher.

850
00:52:39,945 --> 00:52:41,679
And as a guy?

851
00:52:43,047 --> 00:52:46,508
He checked me out sometimes.
- He threatened you?

852
00:52:46,641 --> 00:52:48,258
Threatened? Why?

853
00:52:48,711 --> 00:52:50,741
It was flattering.

854
00:52:51,617 --> 00:52:53,414
It's a network of gerontophiles!

855
00:53:35,474 --> 00:53:37,752
SLAUGHTERHOUSES

856
00:53:58,712 --> 00:54:01,204
Jules? Calm down.

857
00:54:01,877 --> 00:54:03,901
Don't move, I'm coming!

858
00:54:22,547 --> 00:54:25,052
What did you do?
- I screwed up.

859
00:54:25,758 --> 00:54:27,110
I could have succeeded.

860
00:54:29,016 --> 00:54:30,454
Succeed at what?

861
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:33,422
Claire wanted to take the
slaughterhouse director hostage.

862
00:54:33,423 --> 00:54:35,563
To expose the cruelty.

863
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:40,475
It hurts, I need treatment.

864
00:54:40,476 --> 00:54:42,101
Foolish!

865
00:54:57,353 --> 00:55:00,702
"The teacher at the slaughterhouse."
Was that the message?

866
00:55:00,703 --> 00:55:02,103
Thanks, you can go.

867
00:55:02,697 --> 00:55:04,548
What were you doing there?

868
00:55:05,376 --> 00:55:08,494
I suspected Jules was preparing
something.

869
00:55:09,447 --> 00:55:12,509
What are you doing to them? To their heads?

870
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:14,392
One dead, one injured.

871
00:55:14,393 --> 00:55:16,257
It's easy to blame me.

872
00:55:16,875 --> 00:55:19,758
What about the parents?
- All right!

873
00:55:19,759 --> 00:55:21,940
Two students per class will
suffer incest,

874
00:55:21,941 --> 00:55:25,220
but abandoning a kid by the
highway is rare.

875
00:55:25,221 --> 00:55:26,957
You, I mean.

876
00:55:26,997 --> 00:55:31,293
Wasn't the hostage-taking your idea?

877
00:55:31,294 --> 00:55:32,756
Certainly not.

878
00:55:33,139 --> 00:55:35,006
It was Claire's idea.

879
00:55:35,255 --> 00:55:37,565
Mental. In short, always wrong.

880
00:55:37,566 --> 00:55:40,167
What other bad ideas did she have?

881
00:55:40,764 --> 00:55:42,561
I don't know.
- Think.

882
00:55:43,015 --> 00:55:44,913
Well... the boar.

883
00:55:44,914 --> 00:55:47,335
The one at the vet?

884
00:55:47,608 --> 00:55:51,491
Claire wanted to hide it
so it wouldn't be shot.

885
00:55:52,225 --> 00:55:55,233
Deborah calmed her down.
- Poor animal.

886
00:55:55,781 --> 00:55:56,906
The pig.

887
00:55:58,006 --> 00:56:00,483
Good. Take the bracelets
off him, please.

888
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:08,387
The investigating judge will summon
you on the break-in.

889
00:56:08,709 --> 00:56:10,100
Be careful, I'm watching you.

890
00:56:10,404 --> 00:56:12,841
Not like you watch teens.

891
00:56:12,842 --> 00:56:16,178
Don't say that.
- Everyone says it.

892
00:56:17,044 --> 00:56:20,896
Look, of course I notice certain
situations around me...

893
00:56:21,834 --> 00:56:23,014
One thinks about things.

894
00:56:23,272 --> 00:56:25,795
...high school students.
- Even better!

895
00:56:26,123 --> 00:56:29,981
But because of what they give off,

896
00:56:29,982 --> 00:56:33,356
something that sets them apart in
the eyes, their attitude,

897
00:56:33,357 --> 00:56:37,021
or character... but not how
you mean it.

898
00:56:37,545 --> 00:56:40,451
You mean if I had you for a teacher,

899
00:56:40,452 --> 00:56:43,187
I wouldn't have failed?
- You failed?

900
00:57:04,768 --> 00:57:08,377
Where are they?
- The board has fired you.

901
00:57:09,674 --> 00:57:12,620
But without proof?
- The break-in at the slaughterhouse,

902
00:57:12,621 --> 00:57:16,086
dangerous statements.
- I hoped you'd support me.

903
00:57:16,087 --> 00:57:19,255
I did. There's too much.

904
00:57:29,052 --> 00:57:32,732
Bernardet! Don't pretend you
don't see me.

905
00:57:34,421 --> 00:57:38,186
You wouldn't have written to the board
to force me out?

906
00:57:39,166 --> 00:57:41,652
I could have but it's not worth it.

907
00:57:42,087 --> 00:57:43,532
You did it to yourself.

908
00:57:50,691 --> 00:57:53,636
EMERGENCY

909
00:57:58,821 --> 00:57:59,954
Hey, Julot!

910
00:58:00,629 --> 00:58:01,872
The gendarme.

911
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:05,875
My son won't say anything.
- Our son.

912
00:58:05,876 --> 00:58:08,316
Not without a lawyer.
- Why?

913
00:58:08,317 --> 00:58:11,289
Mr. Murat is responsible for the
slaughterhouse,

914
00:58:11,290 --> 00:58:13,733
he manipulated my son.
- Our son.

915
00:58:13,734 --> 00:58:17,780
Family solidarity? That's right,
of course!

916
00:58:17,823 --> 00:58:21,065
You want a lawyer and a scapegoat.

917
00:58:21,101 --> 00:58:25,586
I want the girl's murderer. Do you
want more corpses?

918
00:58:25,587 --> 00:58:26,605
Of course not.

919
00:58:26,606 --> 00:58:27,765
"Of course not."

920
00:58:27,766 --> 00:58:30,731
You want to be called to the morgue?
- No more.

921
00:58:30,732 --> 00:58:34,078
"No more"? So come with me.
- Fuck.

922
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:36,591
What's with the "fuck"?
Stop being rude.

923
00:58:37,232 --> 00:58:39,450
You need a physiotherapist.

924
00:58:39,924 --> 00:58:43,166
Good god, they shouldn't be allowed
to talk to you like that.

925
00:58:43,167 --> 00:58:44,248
In.

926
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,710
Why bring me back here?

927
00:58:47,881 --> 00:58:50,217
My parents are waiting for me.

928
00:58:50,631 --> 00:58:53,272
To succeed, you have to abort
your parents.

929
00:58:53,417 --> 00:58:55,542
Let that sink in, OK?

930
00:58:55,994 --> 00:58:57,728
Little question:

931
00:58:57,896 --> 00:59:00,644
the slaughterhouse raid, who
thought of it?

932
00:59:00,645 --> 00:59:01,885
You or Claire?

933
00:59:02,573 --> 00:59:03,753
Claire.

934
00:59:04,137 --> 00:59:05,755
It was like her hobby.

935
00:59:06,643 --> 00:59:08,260
And your hobby, was it her?

936
00:59:08,774 --> 00:59:11,259
No, she wasn't my girl.

937
00:59:12,188 --> 00:59:14,118
You wanted her to be both
girl and friend.

938
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:16,531
She refused, you killed her.

939
00:59:16,779 --> 00:59:18,232
Not at all.

940
00:59:19,136 --> 00:59:20,386
I didn't kill her.

941
00:59:21,346 --> 00:59:25,846
I'm wondering something: why didn't
she choose you?

942
00:59:26,238 --> 00:59:28,335
Do you know who she liked best?
- No.

943
00:59:28,336 --> 00:59:29,348
You don't know?
- No.

944
00:59:29,349 --> 00:59:31,203
Who?
- No.

945
00:59:31,223 --> 00:59:32,285
Who...

946
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:35,013
No!

947
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:38,100
Not him?
- No, not him.

948
00:59:39,136 --> 00:59:41,409
Good, listen to something for
two minutes.

949
00:59:47,206 --> 00:59:49,266
You don't want to be
an informer, fine.

950
00:59:49,267 --> 00:59:50,983
But I will go with my
favorite theory.

951
00:59:50,999 --> 00:59:54,818
Jail is for him or for you, choose.

952
00:59:57,269 --> 00:59:58,382
Murat.

953
00:59:58,402 --> 01:00:00,925
I saw him with Claire the night
she died.

954
01:00:00,926 --> 01:00:02,193
That's it.

955
01:00:02,585 --> 01:00:06,242
You gave in fast, you wouldn't have
made a good Resistance fighter.

956
01:00:07,176 --> 01:00:08,285
Golly.

957
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:15,051
Are you resigning?

958
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:18,220
They're forcing me, I'll respond.

959
01:00:19,595 --> 01:00:22,486
Resisting is really good.

960
01:00:23,622 --> 01:00:25,763
I can go?
- Yes.

961
01:00:25,764 --> 01:00:29,208
You forgot something.
- What?

962
01:00:29,209 --> 01:00:33,111
In front of your door, it's dirty,
you have to sweep.

963
01:00:33,306 --> 01:00:35,485
I didn't do anything.

964
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:41,618
Yet you didn't tell me you saw
Claire the night of the murder:

965
01:00:41,619 --> 01:00:43,689
lie by omission.

966
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:46,824
It's a lot, no?

967
01:00:50,099 --> 01:00:52,997
Hey! Wait for me.

968
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:58,272
I jostled a gendarme.

969
01:00:58,375 --> 01:01:01,180
Are you stopping me?
- Don't tempt me.

970
01:01:01,478 --> 01:01:04,095
Who told you I saw Claire?

971
01:01:04,096 --> 01:01:08,741
Someone who told me it
was happening.

972
01:01:09,063 --> 01:01:10,305
Wow!

973
01:01:11,057 --> 01:01:12,565
It's nice,

974
01:01:12,743 --> 01:01:16,599
a little secret date.
- Jules told you!

975
01:01:17,649 --> 01:01:20,889
He was jealous, suspicious, so
he followed me.

976
01:01:23,162 --> 01:01:26,437
I wanted to see her to convince her

977
01:01:26,438 --> 01:01:29,156
to come back to class, but she avoided me.

978
01:01:29,157 --> 01:01:32,319
She never visited?
- Until that day.

979
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:34,965
<i>Are you following us?
- No, I was walking around.</i>

980
01:01:34,966 --> 01:01:37,825
She was about to crack.

981
01:01:37,826 --> 01:01:41,856
I made a 7 pm appointment to talk
with her.

982
01:01:41,857 --> 01:01:46,205
OK; 7pm, time of the crime.

983
01:01:46,532 --> 01:01:47,939
So what happened?

984
01:02:00,336 --> 01:02:03,710
Claire was in a hurry to be elsewhere.

985
01:02:04,178 --> 01:02:05,569
And as she was leaving...

986
01:02:06,929 --> 01:02:08,578
What?
- She kissed me,

987
01:02:10,196 --> 01:02:12,141
like a goodbye kiss.

988
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:21,235
Castel, at 7 pm Claire was with Murat.
Does that sound weird to you?

989
01:02:21,243 --> 01:02:24,267
Someone said-what was it?

990
01:02:24,268 --> 01:02:27,077
Not possible. At 7pm her phone was
in the middle of the countryside.

991
01:02:27,078 --> 01:02:29,107
So someone stole it.

992
01:02:39,161 --> 01:02:40,371
All right, love?
- Yeah.

993
01:02:47,278 --> 01:02:49,451
Say, about the Claire thing:

994
01:02:49,452 --> 01:02:50,856
after coming here,

995
01:02:50,857 --> 01:02:52,418
why didn't she have her phone?

996
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:55,184
I don't know,

997
01:02:55,575 --> 01:02:57,614
she dropped it?

998
01:02:57,615 --> 01:02:59,391
Of course.
- Hello.

999
01:03:01,325 --> 01:03:03,028
That doesn't bother you,
does it?

1000
01:03:03,481 --> 01:03:06,074
Why so nervous during the search?
That's why you pay me!

1001
01:03:06,075 --> 01:03:08,669
You've no reason to get all defensive.

1002
01:03:08,670 --> 01:03:10,458
Move, you can explain it to me.

1003
01:03:10,903 --> 01:03:13,192
Don't bother, no one's going to
steal your stuff.

1004
01:03:14,506 --> 01:03:15,662
So long, love.
- Bye.

1005
01:03:16,277 --> 01:03:17,439
Yeah.

1006
01:03:17,459 --> 01:03:19,778
No handcuffs?
- If you want.

1007
01:03:20,942 --> 01:03:23,271
You think you're in an American movie.

1008
01:03:23,661 --> 01:03:25,645
Here, do it yourself.

1009
01:03:37,388 --> 01:03:38,779
Handcuffs!

1010
01:04:00,904 --> 01:04:02,795
Is he going to last a long time?

1011
01:04:03,576 --> 01:04:04,525
What?

1012
01:04:08,655 --> 01:04:10,068
I didn't kill her.

1013
01:04:10,107 --> 01:04:13,092
So much the better, one less suspect.

1014
01:04:13,271 --> 01:04:15,068
Let's say someone else killed her:

1015
01:04:15,069 --> 01:04:17,139
before she died, what'd you do?

1016
01:04:17,163 --> 01:04:18,616
I took her mobile.

1017
01:04:18,617 --> 01:04:21,147
Why, for the plan?
- What?

1018
01:04:21,171 --> 01:04:22,515
For her plan?

1019
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:23,983
No...

1020
01:04:24,003 --> 01:04:26,425
When she changed majors,

1021
01:04:26,686 --> 01:04:30,530
I thought it had something to
do with Yannick.

1022
01:04:30,531 --> 01:04:32,830
Something distasteful?

1023
01:04:35,487 --> 01:04:39,886
At the end of a class, she forgot
her mobile.

1024
01:04:40,667 --> 01:04:43,152
You stole it?

1025
01:04:43,987 --> 01:04:48,557
No, I stopped-I looked at
the files on it.

1026
01:04:49,527 --> 01:04:53,166
You're not "juleferryien."
- What?

1027
01:04:53,968 --> 01:04:56,828
She knew it was me, I was the
last one in the room.

1028
01:04:56,829 --> 01:04:58,920
So that's why she went to see you,

1029
01:04:58,937 --> 01:04:59,939
She wanted to snitch on you,

1030
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:02,311
and you killed her.
- No.

1031
01:05:02,312 --> 01:05:04,444
I got rid of it.

1032
01:05:04,445 --> 01:05:07,529
The body?
- The phone! Shit!

1033
01:05:07,530 --> 01:05:11,328
Hey, no big words.

1034
01:05:11,329 --> 01:05:13,305
Wipe your nose.

1035
01:05:14,863 --> 01:05:19,356
There's where you abandoned me.
- See, I came back.

1036
01:05:19,503 --> 01:05:20,644
There's the pond.

1037
01:05:20,739 --> 01:05:22,887
The pond? It's about time.

1038
01:05:23,778 --> 01:05:27,332
So; one, two;

1039
01:05:28,301 --> 01:05:29,504
well...

1040
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:32,105
Shall I go?
- Yes.

1041
01:05:32,106 --> 01:05:34,091
Pay attention!

1042
01:05:43,882 --> 01:05:46,413
Isn't that a bit far?
- No.

1043
01:05:46,975 --> 01:05:50,615
I have colleagues you will stay
like that for hours.

1044
01:05:51,035 --> 01:05:52,620
There, I found it.

1045
01:05:52,621 --> 01:05:54,558
See, I was telling the truth.

1046
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:57,030
The truth is you obstructed the
investigation,

1047
01:05:57,031 --> 01:05:58,972
that won't cut it.

1048
01:05:59,159 --> 01:06:03,261
Help me, I'm not gonna do
all the work.

1049
01:06:05,621 --> 01:06:06,941
There it is, here.

1050
01:06:18,670 --> 01:06:20,748
Captain?
- What?

1051
01:06:20,956 --> 01:06:24,534
There, I recovered the SIM card data.

1052
01:06:24,535 --> 01:06:29,477
How did you do it?
- It wasn't me.

1053
01:06:29,478 --> 01:06:32,441
It was my 12 year old daughter,
she's got the fingers.

1054
01:06:32,456 --> 01:06:34,964
Twelve? She'll go far.

1055
01:06:35,494 --> 01:06:38,042
If she doesn't meet a pervert.

1056
01:06:38,299 --> 01:06:40,690
Or become paranoid, like her father.

1057
01:06:41,887 --> 01:06:43,317
Now then.

1058
01:06:46,139 --> 01:06:48,585
There's a text message in Drafts

1059
01:06:48,586 --> 01:06:51,543
from the day before her death.

1060
01:06:52,294 --> 01:06:56,395
NO RECIPIENT:
SAMANTHA LORD IS RETURNING SOON

1061
01:06:56,432 --> 01:06:59,659
"Samantha Lord"? Who's that?

1062
01:07:07,930 --> 01:07:09,383
Anybody here?

1063
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:13,820
Banzai.

1064
01:07:15,256 --> 01:07:20,335
Awww, it's "cute," a small fireplace!

1065
01:07:20,834 --> 01:07:22,826
Awww, a Christmas tree!

1066
01:07:22,827 --> 01:07:25,694
Piano, candle!

1067
01:07:25,695 --> 01:07:29,192
It's romantico-erotic tonight.!

1068
01:07:29,427 --> 01:07:31,450
I'm not disturbing you.
- As always.

1069
01:07:31,451 --> 01:07:34,959
I wasn't asking. Sit down, sir!

1070
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:37,871
Thanks, I'd rather not.
- Is that so.

1071
01:07:39,316 --> 01:07:42,761
I wanted to know... how do you play this?

1072
01:07:44,353 --> 01:07:48,048
...no. I wanted to know:
who's Samantha Lord?

1073
01:07:48,742 --> 01:07:51,758
Samantha Lord was an Australian
activist from the 70s,

1074
01:07:51,759 --> 01:07:54,916
who committed burglaries to
finance her

1075
01:07:54,917 --> 01:07:57,138
pro-environment work.

1076
01:07:57,139 --> 01:07:59,605
You talked about her in your classes?

1077
01:07:59,606 --> 01:08:01,880
I cited her as an activist

1078
01:08:01,881 --> 01:08:04,464
of action.
- That's it.

1079
01:08:04,465 --> 01:08:08,527
The kid wanted to imitate your example.

1080
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:11,317
Or look like the ideal woman.

1081
01:08:11,318 --> 01:08:13,184
You can watch while I make
the scallops.

1082
01:08:14,656 --> 01:08:16,970
The girl in the kitchen,
what a macho cliche.

1083
01:08:16,971 --> 01:08:19,359
Good! So...

1084
01:08:19,945 --> 01:08:22,768
Last time, you said the kid looked
as if she was

1085
01:08:22,769 --> 01:08:25,821
in a hurry, but for what?

1086
01:08:25,822 --> 01:08:27,688
I don't know.

1087
01:08:27,828 --> 01:08:29,547
Hey, it's good, huh?

1088
01:08:31,556 --> 01:08:33,050
Neither do I.

1089
01:08:33,216 --> 01:08:36,215
Maybe in a hurry to kidnap
the oinker?

1090
01:08:36,216 --> 01:08:39,321
Huh, Mama Deborah?
- By herself? A 100kg animal?

1091
01:08:39,322 --> 01:08:41,400
You would've prevented it.

1092
01:08:41,401 --> 01:08:43,930
No, I should have helped her,

1093
01:08:44,089 --> 01:08:46,853
denounce the slimy hunt.

1094
01:08:46,854 --> 01:08:50,081
Animal welfare and climate change
were her avocation.

1095
01:08:50,392 --> 01:08:56,104
If all young people were like her,
the planet would be better.

1096
01:08:56,124 --> 01:08:58,421
Well I agree with you.

1097
01:08:58,766 --> 01:09:03,735
But didn't you say she wanted to
hire environmental lawyers?

1098
01:09:03,736 --> 01:09:06,672
An environmental lawyer, but she
couldn't afford it.

1099
01:09:06,673 --> 01:09:09,563
'How would she have paid for it'
is the question.

1100
01:09:16,796 --> 01:09:18,096
Maude!

1101
01:09:18,249 --> 01:09:21,023
What are you doing here?
- You're not going to crack,

1102
01:09:22,035 --> 01:09:23,598
and let me down?

1103
01:09:23,789 --> 01:09:25,242
Why do you say that?

1104
01:09:25,398 --> 01:09:28,523
You don't Mr. Murat to pay.

1105
01:09:29,047 --> 01:09:30,347
But...

1106
01:09:31,491 --> 01:09:33,679
Do you have the bracelet?
- Yes.

1107
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:38,085
Let's see it.
- Here you go. Why do you want it?

1108
01:09:38,139 --> 01:09:40,561
What do you see? A bracelet

1109
01:09:40,562 --> 01:09:42,858
with a stamped eagle's head.

1110
01:09:42,859 --> 01:09:45,678
At least 18 carats, it's worth a cool sum.

1111
01:09:46,084 --> 01:09:49,217
They say it was too big, why wear it,
she could lose it.

1112
01:09:49,218 --> 01:09:51,546
Why was she wearing it that night?

1113
01:09:51,547 --> 01:09:54,537
What's your conclusion?
- Who would have stolen from

1114
01:09:54,538 --> 01:10:00,163
their parents to pay a top
environmental lawyer?

1115
01:10:00,224 --> 01:10:01,865
Samantha Lord.

1116
01:10:01,964 --> 01:10:04,566
For a wild boar?
- Maybe not her,

1117
01:10:05,885 --> 01:10:10,135
but imagine a teenage girl, 17,

1118
01:10:10,286 --> 01:10:12,528
a little militant, a little idealistic.

1119
01:10:13,066 --> 01:10:17,043
And adoptive mother of a wild pig.

1120
01:10:17,348 --> 01:10:19,075
Who do you see?

1121
01:10:19,305 --> 01:10:22,305
She wouldn't let her oinker get killed.

1122
01:10:46,829 --> 01:10:49,329
What are you thinking about?

1123
01:10:50,014 --> 01:10:51,717
Is her death my fault?

1124
01:10:52,391 --> 01:10:55,563
I encouraged her with no supervision.

1125
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:57,469
Don't beat yourself up.

1126
01:10:58,563 --> 01:11:03,844
We got by when we were young, but
not all kids can adapt.

1127
01:11:23,294 --> 01:11:26,215
I heard you were laid off.

1128
01:11:26,287 --> 01:11:29,340
How?
- A neighbor hears things.

1129
01:11:29,341 --> 01:11:32,160
I wanted to tell you, if a fight
is necessary,

1130
01:11:32,161 --> 01:11:34,536
start a petition, I can canvass for it.

1131
01:11:34,684 --> 01:11:37,193
Don't hesitate to ask me.

1132
01:11:37,194 --> 01:11:40,623
That's nice of you, but I'll be fine.
- I won't insist.

1133
01:11:41,442 --> 01:11:44,895
If the cops won't leave you alone,
I could-

1134
01:11:44,896 --> 01:11:47,374
No, everything's worked out there, thanks.

1135
01:11:54,357 --> 01:11:56,927
Weird. We've never spoken before.

1136
01:11:56,928 --> 01:12:00,864
Always ready to defend the widows
and orphans.

1137
01:12:14,811 --> 01:12:19,138
♪ My reassuring danger,
my excess of madness ♪

1138
01:12:20,394 --> 01:12:23,936
♪ aside from nothing, the
cards of my life ♪

1139
01:12:23,937 --> 01:12:27,693
It's Catherine Lara, not Mozart's Requiem.

1140
01:12:27,694 --> 01:12:29,981
♪...to cursed lovers. ♪

1141
01:12:29,982 --> 01:12:32,442
You loved your step-daughter daughter.

1142
01:12:32,443 --> 01:12:35,559
A €1,000 bracelet!
- €2,300,

1143
01:12:35,792 --> 01:12:37,784
I had it appraised.

1144
01:12:38,033 --> 01:12:42,150
Did the kid know that?
- I think so.

1145
01:12:42,683 --> 01:12:45,089
The one you told me about?
- Yes.

1146
01:12:45,697 --> 01:12:48,518
Can I see?
- Why yes.

1147
01:12:50,084 --> 01:12:51,928
Did you see her with it?

1148
01:12:52,817 --> 01:12:54,496
No, I'd have liked to.

1149
01:12:55,066 --> 01:12:56,386
It's magnificent.

1150
01:12:57,948 --> 01:13:01,214
You did so much.
- She was wonderful.

1151
01:13:02,018 --> 01:13:04,667
Dad going out with the principal
was a bit complicated for her.

1152
01:13:04,668 --> 01:13:06,573
Not your fault you're in love.

1153
01:13:06,681 --> 01:13:10,727
How did you both meet?
- He didn't want Claire to go to

1154
01:13:10,728 --> 01:13:16,011
an agricultural school.
She forced him to see it.

1155
01:13:16,243 --> 01:13:21,000
We visited.
- And its charm worked.

1156
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:24,072
He registered Claire, and asked me out.

1157
01:13:24,073 --> 01:13:27,387
So, the family jewels:
where are they now?

1158
01:13:28,439 --> 01:13:29,739
Well-

1159
01:13:30,046 --> 01:13:31,346
What?

1160
01:13:31,627 --> 01:13:33,088
No, nothing.

1161
01:13:37,776 --> 01:13:38,956
Well.

1162
01:13:39,617 --> 01:13:41,680
Was it in here?
- Yes.

1163
01:13:41,714 --> 01:13:44,127
You keep the gift boxes?

1164
01:13:44,128 --> 01:13:46,472
She didn't want the box, she wanted
to wear the bracelet.

1165
01:13:46,473 --> 01:13:49,272
But it was too big.
- All the same.

1166
01:13:50,262 --> 01:13:52,731
She didn't steal it?

1167
01:13:52,732 --> 01:13:56,315
Not at all. Ridiculous!
- Me, ridiculous?

1168
01:13:56,603 --> 01:13:58,376
Let me look.

1169
01:13:59,875 --> 01:14:03,141
I know, it's because of the hat.

1170
01:14:03,836 --> 01:14:08,563
Anyway, I know a picked lock
when I see one.

1171
01:14:08,975 --> 01:14:12,759
Mirror, who's the biggest fibber
of all, the stepmom?

1172
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:16,353
What? Would Maude have killed Claire
for this jewelry

1173
01:14:16,354 --> 01:14:21,023
without even taking it?
- True, it's not very logical.

1174
01:14:21,446 --> 01:14:23,102
This mirror sucks.

1175
01:14:24,349 --> 01:14:27,192
Furthermore, you're right,

1176
01:14:27,193 --> 01:14:29,633
she wouldn't have moved the body,

1177
01:14:29,634 --> 01:14:31,001
a body is heavy.

1178
01:14:31,002 --> 01:14:34,243
It takes two.
Catherine Lara!

1179
01:14:34,526 --> 01:14:35,924
That's nice.

1180
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:38,137
"Requiem For A Love."

1181
01:14:38,184 --> 01:14:41,043
You know who's listening to this?

1182
01:14:41,497 --> 01:14:43,810
What's-his-name,

1183
01:14:43,811 --> 01:14:47,794
Mr. Rufus. He lives next door
to the school.

1184
01:14:50,208 --> 01:14:51,817
Captain?
- Go ahead.

1185
01:14:52,709 --> 01:14:56,284
Are you going to see him?
- Why, shouldn't I?

1186
01:14:56,679 --> 01:14:58,390
We were together at one time,

1187
01:14:58,625 --> 01:14:59,773
when I first started teaching.

1188
01:14:59,774 --> 01:15:03,825
YOU AND THE-you were seeing the
old butt, the anarchist?

1189
01:15:04,035 --> 01:15:05,574
Grade A, like you.

1190
01:15:05,773 --> 01:15:08,007
The angst. Was it back on?

1191
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:09,835
I think so. Yes.

1192
01:15:10,139 --> 01:15:14,365
*This* started up again, Claire knew
about it and died.

1193
01:15:14,366 --> 01:15:17,199
I love my husband, I'm not
cheating on him.

1194
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:20,225
Well, Rufus has no luck.
- Captain?

1195
01:15:20,226 --> 01:15:22,458
It's true that

1196
01:15:22,459 --> 01:15:26,780
coming back to try again.
- To your house?

1197
01:15:27,374 --> 01:15:29,679
The night of the murder?
- No!

1198
01:15:30,307 --> 01:15:32,580
Come on, I'm not going to his place.

1199
01:15:33,198 --> 01:15:34,620
I'll say no more.

1200
01:16:00,295 --> 01:16:02,498
We doing this tournament,
or what?

1201
01:16:02,499 --> 01:16:04,186
Don't be boring.

1202
01:16:04,295 --> 01:16:06,561
We could've done without the
slaughterhouse.

1203
01:16:06,801 --> 01:16:09,192
I did it for Claire.
- She didn't ask anything of you.

1204
01:16:30,504 --> 01:16:31,769
What do you want?

1205
01:16:32,049 --> 01:16:33,955
I thought about your proposition.

1206
01:16:35,499 --> 01:16:36,622
OK, I forgot.

1207
01:16:36,623 --> 01:16:39,757
I thought you were just being polite.
- Wait.

1208
01:16:48,331 --> 01:16:49,506
Good...

1209
01:16:49,808 --> 01:16:54,769
What we could do is talk about your
firing on social networks,

1210
01:16:54,894 --> 01:16:57,822
I have a dozen aliases.

1211
01:16:57,823 --> 01:16:59,136
Come in, come in.

1212
01:17:07,537 --> 01:17:12,443
Tell me about yourself so we can
make you a positive profile.

1213
01:17:12,529 --> 01:17:15,350
It creates empathy.

1214
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:18,164
It'd suit you if they accuse me.

1215
01:17:18,662 --> 01:17:21,741
Yesterday you came looking for info.

1216
01:17:21,742 --> 01:17:25,601
Are you here for that, now? Huh?

1217
01:17:25,710 --> 01:17:28,329
You suspect me over nothing.

1218
01:17:28,330 --> 01:17:30,890
A young girl died, I remind you!

1219
01:17:30,891 --> 01:17:34,234
Yeah, and you feel a little responsible.

1220
01:17:34,856 --> 01:17:36,926
You're obsessed with this school.

1221
01:17:37,414 --> 01:17:38,633
Yes, for 15 years.

1222
01:17:38,634 --> 01:17:40,874
Those photos
prove it's a nuisance.

1223
01:17:41,087 --> 01:17:42,556
I've had it up to here.

1224
01:17:42,557 --> 01:17:44,989
You'll burn them?
- Yeah, yeah.

1225
01:17:45,501 --> 01:17:46,427
Even Claire?

1226
01:17:46,447 --> 01:17:51,230
I have no pictures of Claire.
She wasn't into me.

1227
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:52,491
You old asshole.

1228
01:17:52,611 --> 01:17:56,236
Do you think I killed your darling?

1229
01:17:56,799 --> 01:17:58,549
The investigation interests you.

1230
01:17:58,550 --> 01:18:01,237
Yeah, I'm curious.

1231
01:18:04,877 --> 01:18:07,688
Sorry, I'm a suspect, so I take it

1232
01:18:07,689 --> 01:18:09,860
out on the innocent.

1233
01:18:09,861 --> 01:18:10,884
No hard feelings?

1234
01:18:23,644 --> 01:18:24,819
Maude?

1235
01:18:25,969 --> 01:18:27,153
Where are you going?

1236
01:18:27,173 --> 01:18:29,689
We have the inter-class tournament.

1237
01:18:30,736 --> 01:18:31,752
Are you going to golf?

1238
01:18:32,056 --> 01:18:35,080
No, I'm missing a driver, I wonder
where it's gone.

1239
01:18:35,081 --> 01:18:36,876
We'll look for it together.

1240
01:18:52,482 --> 01:18:56,067
The Petit-Clarart Killing.
Is this an OAS hideout?

1241
01:18:56,068 --> 01:18:58,637
Good evening, sir! Are you in?

1242
01:18:59,639 --> 01:19:03,228
You're not the killer. Satisfied?
- What do you want?

1243
01:19:03,391 --> 01:19:06,768
I said to myself, it's weird since
she's not guilty,

1244
01:19:06,769 --> 01:19:08,952
so how come she freaked out when
I questioned her?

1245
01:19:08,953 --> 01:19:10,725
I leave when I'm done.

1246
01:19:10,726 --> 01:19:13,023
And you'll see if my hand goes along.

1247
01:19:13,727 --> 01:19:15,321
Liar, you lied

1248
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:18,483
when you said Claire wasn't at
home that night.

1249
01:19:18,656 --> 01:19:22,692
Haven't you seen an illicit couple

1250
01:19:22,693 --> 01:19:26,981
that includes a gentleman
high school hunter?

1251
01:19:28,436 --> 01:19:29,631
I can't count on anyone.

1252
01:19:30,263 --> 01:19:35,662
You can count on me. Promise,
swear, spit.

1253
01:19:40,813 --> 01:19:42,454
There was a 4x4 at the house,

1254
01:19:44,087 --> 01:19:45,759
with a man.
- Who?

1255
01:19:47,641 --> 01:19:48,891
He threatened me,

1256
01:19:50,136 --> 01:19:51,768
I'm to say nothing.

1257
01:19:53,594 --> 01:19:54,898
This guy has a screw loose.

1258
01:19:55,314 --> 01:19:56,502
A box is missing.

1259
01:19:56,908 --> 01:19:57,826
He's watching me.

1260
01:19:57,846 --> 01:19:59,244
Who was it?

1261
01:19:59,393 --> 01:20:01,799
Was it Rufus Cordelier? Is that who?

1262
01:20:02,424 --> 01:20:03,591
Is it?

1263
01:20:04,541 --> 01:20:05,611
It's him.

1264
01:20:05,612 --> 01:20:08,485
He's got a big mouth and small arms.

1265
01:20:08,554 --> 01:20:11,499
Cordelier's a sentimentalist,
don't be afraid.

1266
01:20:25,641 --> 01:20:26,899
Gendarmerie!

1267
01:20:27,485 --> 01:20:30,009
Hey! Gendarmerie!
- Hey, hey...

1268
01:20:30,017 --> 01:20:32,275
We're conducting a search.

1269
01:20:32,665 --> 01:20:35,517
We're conducting a search.
- Go, get out!

1270
01:20:35,518 --> 01:20:39,518
Whoa, hey, no no no! Stay here!

1271
01:20:45,612 --> 01:20:47,386
It's Murat's bike.

1272
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:49,309
Murat!

1273
01:20:57,719 --> 01:20:58,828
Here you are!

1274
01:20:59,149 --> 01:21:01,430
I thought he killed you!

1275
01:21:02,476 --> 01:21:05,484
It's OK, it's over. Sit down.

1276
01:21:05,485 --> 01:21:06,852
You're all green.

1277
01:21:06,905 --> 01:21:09,124
I don't understand; I understand
nothing.

1278
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:11,297
A minute! There you go.

1279
01:21:11,298 --> 01:21:14,258
I wanted to play gendarme.

1280
01:21:14,259 --> 01:21:17,321
Well done! You needed to
trust me.

1281
01:21:17,445 --> 01:21:21,062
Did you come to avenge her?

1282
01:21:21,063 --> 01:21:22,360
I know everything.

1283
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:23,899
Everything!

1284
01:21:24,328 --> 01:21:25,781
You all right?
- No.

1285
01:21:25,804 --> 01:21:27,226
I'll get water.

1286
01:21:29,775 --> 01:21:31,149
Come on, stick to him!

1287
01:21:31,157 --> 01:21:32,469
Breathe!

1288
01:21:33,210 --> 01:21:35,842
Come on, stick to him! Isabelle,
stick to him! Good!

1289
01:21:35,954 --> 01:21:37,329
Well done!

1290
01:21:38,235 --> 01:21:40,603
Watch him! Go, go!

1291
01:21:42,551 --> 01:21:43,660
Stick to him!

1292
01:21:51,125 --> 01:21:52,417
Rhythm.

1293
01:21:52,717 --> 01:21:53,821
He's going!

1294
01:21:55,026 --> 01:21:56,326
Rhythm!

1295
01:21:58,203 --> 01:21:59,593
Come on!

1296
01:22:06,023 --> 01:22:07,226
Look.

1297
01:22:08,577 --> 01:22:10,320
It's the cops.

1298
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:47,902
Well, what?

1299
01:22:48,481 --> 01:22:50,840
Aren't you going out the front door?

1300
01:22:51,363 --> 01:22:53,808
Come, I know how to be discreet.

1301
01:22:53,957 --> 01:22:55,137
Hee hee!

1302
01:22:55,138 --> 01:22:57,644
Gendarmerie! Let us pass.

1303
01:22:57,727 --> 01:23:01,671
You didn't mention that he threatened
a student with a knife.

1304
01:23:02,335 --> 01:23:05,812
We were counting on you in
the investigation.

1305
01:23:05,813 --> 01:23:08,326
What was he doing at your place the
night of the murder?

1306
01:23:08,327 --> 01:23:09,608
He wasn't.

1307
01:23:09,609 --> 01:23:11,527
He wasn't there.

1308
01:23:11,709 --> 01:23:17,130
Maybe Rufus stole the jewelry
while she was out;

1309
01:23:17,131 --> 01:23:19,214
Her stepdaughter surprised him-

1310
01:23:19,215 --> 01:23:20,932
He killed her.
- That works.

1311
01:23:20,933 --> 01:23:25,158
And when the lady realizes Rufus
is the killer,

1312
01:23:25,159 --> 01:23:27,766
she says nothing and covers for him,

1313
01:23:27,767 --> 01:23:30,417
for old time's sake-you follow me?

1314
01:23:30,498 --> 01:23:35,006
Or out of guilt, for dumping him.
- That's it;

1315
01:23:35,263 --> 01:23:36,481
that's it, right?

1316
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,779
No answer.

1317
01:23:39,060 --> 01:23:42,395
No problem: we'll take the DNA
from his van.

1318
01:23:42,726 --> 01:23:46,016
We'll find evidence Claire was in it,
alive or dead.

1319
01:23:46,328 --> 01:23:48,821
By the way, where did he kill her,
the woods?

1320
01:23:48,822 --> 01:23:50,126
It's not him.

1321
01:23:50,659 --> 01:23:51,972
"It's not him"!

1322
01:23:52,798 --> 01:23:55,025
It's not him; well shit then.

1323
01:23:55,338 --> 01:23:57,073
If by chance it's not him:

1324
01:23:57,104 --> 01:24:01,354
in fairy tales, heteronormative sexist
ones of course,

1325
01:24:02,127 --> 01:24:05,900
if the killer isn't Prince Charming, it's?

1326
01:24:05,904 --> 01:24:08,475
The stepmother.
- And that works.

1327
01:24:23,792 --> 01:24:25,386
I returned earlier than expected.

1328
01:24:27,457 --> 01:24:29,566
A broken window, something
had happened.

1329
01:24:31,502 --> 01:24:33,916
I remembered the threats
against Claire.

1330
01:24:41,065 --> 01:24:43,344
The power was out.

1331
01:24:46,538 --> 01:24:48,382
Someone had entered.

1332
01:25:34,327 --> 01:25:35,577
<i>Claire?</i>

1333
01:25:56,072 --> 01:25:57,372
<i>*Hello?*</i>

1334
01:25:57,899 --> 01:26:00,188
<i>I knew you would call me back.</i>

1335
01:26:00,797 --> 01:26:02,407
<i>It's over for me.</i>

1336
01:26:03,197 --> 01:26:04,361
<i>*What?*</i>

1337
01:26:05,039 --> 01:26:07,180
<i>I killed her.
- *Who?*</i>

1338
01:26:07,490 --> 01:26:09,271
<i>Antoine's daughter.</i>

1339
01:26:11,378 --> 01:26:12,503
<i>*I'm coming.*</i>

1340
01:26:19,431 --> 01:26:21,657
The daughter of my love.

1341
01:26:21,793 --> 01:26:24,475
It's not your fault, you didn't
do it on purpose.

1342
01:26:24,476 --> 01:26:26,764
You didn't know it was her.

1343
01:26:26,765 --> 01:26:28,178
What does it change?

1344
01:26:28,378 --> 01:26:31,089
Antoine knew it was tense between
her and me.

1345
01:26:31,090 --> 01:26:35,129
That's why you called Rufus?
- He told me to keep quiet.

1346
01:26:36,051 --> 01:26:38,801
He told me to keep quiet, it was an
accident and I couldn't bring Claire back.

1347
01:26:40,279 --> 01:26:42,662
A principal who kills a student;

1348
01:26:45,041 --> 01:26:47,150
I let myself be led.

1349
01:26:47,151 --> 01:26:51,154
It's his fault. He cleans everything up,
tells you to stay quiet,

1350
01:26:51,155 --> 01:26:54,929
moves the body. What he wouldn't
do for her!

1351
01:26:54,930 --> 01:26:56,863
The man is crazy.

1352
01:26:57,325 --> 01:27:01,911
The stupid thing is that he didn't
see the bracelet had fallen off.

1353
01:27:01,912 --> 01:27:05,556
By leaving an empty box in my
jewelry drawer-

1354
01:27:05,557 --> 01:27:08,967
You made it appear that she
had boosted it.

1355
01:27:09,307 --> 01:27:11,494
She wasn't stupid:

1356
01:27:11,882 --> 01:27:14,960
she made believe there was a
burglary, by breaking the window.

1357
01:27:15,021 --> 01:27:17,498
But she had glass shards on her face.

1358
01:27:17,499 --> 01:27:21,220
I would have given her the damn
bracelet. But I lied.

1359
01:27:21,548 --> 01:27:23,955
A pig with a lawyer would be a surprise.

1360
01:27:24,173 --> 01:27:26,619
She didn't need money,

1361
01:27:26,620 --> 01:27:30,064
she needed attention and listening.

1362
01:27:30,197 --> 01:27:31,541
Right?
- Right.

1363
01:27:31,542 --> 01:27:32,643
Right.

1364
01:27:41,408 --> 01:27:44,392
Your wife wanted to denounce herself.

1365
01:27:45,088 --> 01:27:46,838
But she turned to Rufus.

1366
01:27:49,164 --> 01:27:52,929
To say nothing and not go down
for Claire.

1367
01:27:55,646 --> 01:28:00,036
It's my fault, I should have understood
my daughter better.

1368
01:28:00,705 --> 01:28:05,315
A little means a lot in life, remember
the happy parts.

1369
01:28:07,908 --> 01:28:09,208
Captain?

1370
01:28:09,744 --> 01:28:11,236
How is this?

1371
01:28:14,062 --> 01:28:18,633
"Her age escaped childhood, laughing
like innocence."

1372
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:21,141
Where's this from?
- An 18th century poem,

1373
01:28:21,263 --> 01:28:24,201
for her headstone next to
her mother's.

1374
01:28:26,606 --> 01:28:27,906
It's nice.

1375
01:28:37,316 --> 01:28:39,144
Block the penetration!

1376
01:28:39,175 --> 01:28:40,558
No, none of that!

1377
01:28:40,636 --> 01:28:42,042
Yeah, "keep away"!

1378
01:28:42,043 --> 01:28:43,205
Move there!

1379
01:28:44,632 --> 01:28:45,736
Move there!

1380
01:28:47,482 --> 01:28:48,766
Guard!

1381
01:28:49,377 --> 01:28:50,916
That's a foul!

1382
01:28:51,363 --> 01:28:53,804
It was a pivot! No way!

1383
01:28:53,805 --> 01:28:56,096
That's not OK! They're not bad kids!

1384
01:28:56,104 --> 01:28:58,525
They're not Islamo-leftists, right?

1385
01:28:58,706 --> 01:29:00,527
Get back on defense!

1386
01:29:01,854 --> 01:29:03,076
That's right!

1387
01:29:04,063 --> 01:29:05,360
Work it!

1388
01:29:08,375 --> 01:29:09,554
That's sick.

1389
01:29:11,124 --> 01:29:13,514
Go, go, go, replace him!

1390
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:19,144
So, he fills them with his green fantasies?

1391
01:29:19,145 --> 01:29:21,606
Who said anything about fantasies?

1392
01:29:23,956 --> 01:29:26,443
Bless you, my children.

1393
01:29:28,504 --> 01:29:30,510
Hey, break it up, voyeur!

1394
01:29:32,542 --> 01:29:34,042
Bye, Captain!

1395
01:29:34,721 --> 01:29:37,956
No way! Pass the ball! Pass the ball!

1396
01:29:41,387 --> 01:29:43,028
You dummies!
