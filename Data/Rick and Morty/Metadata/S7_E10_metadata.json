Rick finds Diane (his dead wife) in his lounge room, posing speculations from both Rick and Morty as to if they have escaped the hole and what their fear is. As Rick becomes happier with Dian, Morty sees that he is dying. Morty takes matters into his own hands by letting his fear feed on him - being accepted. Morty humiliates himself so much that he is on the brink of death, only for Rick to save him and help him be accepted. They both return out of the hole, only to find themselves in a loop, questioning whether they are In the hole or not and whether their fear is their actual fear. Morty finally realizes that he fears that Rick would never call him irreplaceable, as it is revealed that Rick never jumped into the hole and it was all Morty's imagination. Morty exits the hole with mental trauma, wondering if Rick really cares about him and would save him."], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "29371876", "rating": 9.4, "votes": 10545, "number_of_episodes": 85}
