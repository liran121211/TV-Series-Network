1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,750
(slow and tense music)

2
00:00:52,316 --> 00:00:53,876
(screaming)

3
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,350
God damn it!

4
00:00:55,353 --> 00:00:57,183
[Gina] Hold him down!

5
00:00:57,218 --> 00:00:58,261
He shot me!

6
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,209
Yeah, that's what you get!

7
00:01:01,244 --> 00:01:03,011
I wasn't gonna shot anybody!

8
00:01:03,046 --> 00:01:05,946
You were still acting like an ass.

9
00:01:05,948 --> 00:01:07,528
We're gonna need to stitch this up.

10
00:01:07,531 --> 00:01:10,251
Alex, can you go get the first aid kit?

11
00:01:10,286 --> 00:01:11,756
Gina?

12
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,480
[Gina] We're not gonna
be those people, Alex.

13
00:01:13,515 --> 00:01:15,729
We're better than them.

14
00:01:15,732 --> 00:01:17,982
(groaning)

15
00:01:21,453 --> 00:01:23,120
He's gonna be fine.

16
00:01:23,155 --> 00:01:24,787
Go fuck yourself!

17
00:01:28,283 --> 00:01:30,533
(groaning)

18
00:01:40,243 --> 00:01:42,573
This is gonna hurt.

19
00:01:42,574 --> 00:01:45,414
(groaning loudly)

20
00:01:54,684 --> 00:01:57,604
(breathing deeply)

21
00:01:59,261 --> 00:02:00,261
Thank you.

22
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:09,856
Whoa, whoa, whoa, don't do that.

23
00:02:13,361 --> 00:02:14,675
Why not?

24
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,140
We don't know what going on out there,

25
00:02:16,175 --> 00:02:17,520
it could be anything.

26
00:02:17,523 --> 00:02:20,067
Reactive contamination, super bacteria.

27
00:02:20,102 --> 00:02:23,712
Synthetic virus attacks
for population containment.

28
00:02:23,747 --> 00:02:25,473
I miss drinking rain water.

29
00:02:25,508 --> 00:02:27,928
David, have you taken a look outside?

30
00:02:27,963 --> 00:02:30,296
Catiline hasn't been affected.

31
00:02:30,301 --> 00:02:31,901
For all we know, the
impact could be something

32
00:02:31,936 --> 00:02:34,479
significantly smaller than expected.

33
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,980
This could be just a
communications blackout.

34
00:02:38,981 --> 00:02:40,351
We don't know what it is.

35
00:02:40,353 --> 00:02:41,872
I know what I saw, alright?

36
00:02:41,907 --> 00:02:43,141
Whoever attacked make
that school out there

37
00:02:43,176 --> 00:02:46,156
something straight out of
the Book of Revelations!

38
00:02:46,164 --> 00:02:47,828
You were attacked?

39
00:02:47,863 --> 00:02:51,033
Yeah, Alex, I was attacked, alright?

40
00:02:52,481 --> 00:02:54,151
Now I'm pretty sure,

41
00:02:56,494 --> 00:02:57,994
they were zombies.

42
00:02:59,602 --> 00:03:01,056
David, have you lost your mind?

43
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:02,510
Look, just hear me out, alright?

44
00:03:02,545 --> 00:03:03,726
No!

45
00:03:03,732 --> 00:03:05,834
I've heard enough of your conspiracy crap.

46
00:03:05,869 --> 00:03:07,936
Look, you ask those
two out there, alright?

47
00:03:07,971 --> 00:03:09,805
I'm sure they've seen it.

48
00:03:09,813 --> 00:03:12,563
This isn't the time for pacifism.

49
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:17,216
I brought this for you.

50
00:03:17,251 --> 00:03:19,421
We don't need that.

51
00:03:44,038 --> 00:03:46,488
We need to know what happened.

52
00:03:46,491 --> 00:03:48,125
What's there to tell?

53
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,570
Cut the shit, just tell
us what happened out there.

54
00:03:50,572 --> 00:03:51,603
David, stop it.

55
00:03:51,638 --> 00:03:53,170
No, this guy and his girlfriend trek

56
00:03:53,205 --> 00:03:55,775
all the way down here to
hold up in an abandon ranch

57
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,797
and attack the owners?

58
00:03:57,832 --> 00:03:59,917
I wanna know why.

59
00:03:59,923 --> 00:04:01,963
And he's going to tell us, right?

60
00:04:01,998 --> 00:04:03,708
His name is Curtis.

61
00:04:05,027 --> 00:04:06,426
Thank you.

62
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:07,825
Yes, I'm Curtis.

63
00:04:11,036 --> 00:04:12,466
This is Apple.

64
00:04:12,474 --> 00:04:13,697
[David] Apple?

65
00:04:13,732 --> 00:04:14,921
Yeah, right.

66
00:04:17,444 --> 00:04:19,284
Listen, it's simple.

67
00:04:21,447 --> 00:04:23,807
The impact was big.

68
00:04:23,813 --> 00:04:24,653
How big?

69
00:04:26,904 --> 00:04:29,404
Entire Eastern seaboard big.

70
00:04:30,718 --> 00:04:34,718
Government, law, order,
it's all gone, you guys.

71
00:04:36,814 --> 00:04:40,214
Worked out pretty
good for you, didn't it?

72
00:04:40,249 --> 00:04:42,830
You wanna know something funny, David?

73
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,753
I'm a sheriff's deputy.

74
00:04:45,738 --> 00:04:48,918
I was on corrections
detail when we got back in.

75
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:50,841
Prison guard.

76
00:04:50,842 --> 00:04:54,332
[David] Was she your prisoner?

77
00:04:54,367 --> 00:04:56,079
She did deputy too.

78
00:04:57,276 --> 00:05:00,686
Why don't you let me hear her say that?

79
00:05:04,402 --> 00:05:06,602
Oh, you don't talk much, do you?

80
00:05:06,604 --> 00:05:08,604
What brought you here?

81
00:05:10,897 --> 00:05:14,417
As you can imagine, it's
kinda hard to run a prison

82
00:05:14,418 --> 00:05:16,248
during the apocalypse.

83
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,946
Wasn't long after the power ran out

84
00:05:20,981 --> 00:05:22,786
the entire place was overrun.

85
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:25,461
(horns blaring)

86
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,726
Stay still.

87
00:05:47,761 --> 00:05:49,525
(growling)

88
00:05:56,305 --> 00:05:58,555
(growling)

89
00:06:06,451 --> 00:06:09,121
(deep exhaling)

90
00:06:10,124 --> 00:06:11,714
I think we're good.

91
00:06:38,202 --> 00:06:40,542
(screaming)

92
00:06:50,872 --> 00:06:53,562
(screaming)

93
00:06:53,564 --> 00:06:55,984
(gun firing)

94
00:07:07,078 --> 00:07:09,498
(gun firing)

95
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:36,189
We got out just in time.

96
00:07:47,411 --> 00:07:50,324
It's not pretty out there.

97
00:07:50,359 --> 00:07:53,029
The world you guys knew is gone.

98
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,950
What about the fucking zombies?

99
00:07:58,985 --> 00:08:00,537
Excuse me?

100
00:08:00,543 --> 00:08:01,341
Not this again.

101
00:08:01,376 --> 00:08:02,706
Look, I know what I saw and I know

102
00:08:02,741 --> 00:08:04,101
that he's seen them too!

103
00:08:04,136 --> 00:08:06,096
That's why you're on this island!

104
00:08:06,131 --> 00:08:07,526
You're fucking in on it.

105
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:08,588
Sheriff's department?

106
00:08:08,593 --> 00:08:10,031
You're probably CIA!

107
00:08:10,066 --> 00:08:12,436
Are you out of your fucking mind?

108
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:13,376
What is it, huh?

109
00:08:13,378 --> 00:08:14,558
Population control?

110
00:08:14,563 --> 00:08:16,853
Genocide, government virus?

111
00:08:16,888 --> 00:08:18,441
Fucking tell me!

112
00:08:18,444 --> 00:08:19,242
David!

113
00:08:19,277 --> 00:08:20,657
Put a leech on your dog, Curtis.

114
00:08:20,658 --> 00:08:21,771
David, calm down.

115
00:08:21,806 --> 00:08:24,186
[David] Nah, this guy's a fucking liar!

116
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:26,812
We all need to calm down.

117
00:08:26,847 --> 00:08:30,177
It's been a long day, we all need sleep.

118
00:08:31,971 --> 00:08:33,721
It's been a long day.

119
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,290
Go.

120
00:08:39,668 --> 00:08:42,918
(footsteps retreating)

121
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,240
(gun clocking)

122
00:08:58,275 --> 00:08:59,065
Shh.

123
00:09:04,747 --> 00:09:07,367
You're gonna fucking talk
or I'm gonna kill you.

124
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:08,550
You're not gonna kill me.

125
00:09:08,554 --> 00:09:10,974
Oh, I'm not gonna kill you?

126
00:09:12,321 --> 00:09:13,446
David!

127
00:09:13,481 --> 00:09:14,533
Stay back!

128
00:09:14,568 --> 00:09:15,748
Get off of him!

129
00:09:15,754 --> 00:09:17,014
Stay out of this, Alex, you don't want

130
00:09:17,049 --> 00:09:17,979
any part of this!

131
00:09:18,014 --> 00:09:19,669
Maybe but this is not the way!

132
00:09:19,704 --> 00:09:21,325
I'm finding out the truth!

133
00:09:21,326 --> 00:09:23,376
Whether you believe me or not,
there's something going on

134
00:09:23,377 --> 00:09:25,397
out there and this guy knows what!

135
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:26,667
What do you wanna know?

136
00:09:26,702 --> 00:09:28,667
Are there zombies?

137
00:09:28,674 --> 00:09:31,254
OK, I'll tell you
anything you wanna know!

138
00:09:31,289 --> 00:09:33,671
(gun firing)

139
00:09:59,313 --> 00:10:01,903
(serene music)
