Fuck!

Aw shit!

Who is that?

(mumbling)

8
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,667
How many are out there?

9
00:01:05,702 --> 00:01:07,437
It's just one, one man!

10
00:01:08,384 --> 00:01:09,439
Screw this!

11
00:01:09,474 --> 00:01:10,494
Excuse me!

12
00:01:15,298 --> 00:01:17,688
(mumbles) me!

13
00:01:17,723 --> 00:01:18,975
Hi-ya!

18
00:01:41,886 --> 00:01:43,366
Who are you?

19
00:01:43,371 --> 00:01:45,371
Uh, my uh, my name is,

20
00:01:47,072 --> 00:01:49,242
is Eddie Gomez, and I'm a,

21
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:52,432
or I was a doctor back in Phoenix.

22
00:01:52,467 --> 00:01:54,575
Phoenix, how'd you get here?

23
00:01:57,084 --> 00:01:59,012
It wasn't easy.

24
00:01:59,047 --> 00:02:00,541
What's it like back on the mainlands?

25
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:02,036
Look you guys need to listen to me here,

26
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:03,169
and listen to me very clearly.

27
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,800
We need to barricade that door,

28
00:02:04,835 --> 00:02:06,825
and we need to board
up these windows, okay?

29
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:09,159
Do whatever it takes to secure
this house, they're coming.

30
00:02:09,194 --> 00:02:11,335
- Who's coming?
- Who do you think?

31
00:02:11,341 --> 00:02:13,539
The fucking zombies man!

32
00:02:13,574 --> 00:02:15,738
They're already here pal.

33
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:16,959
What?

34
00:02:16,962 --> 00:02:19,622
Yeah, your buddy's out there
walking around on the porch.

35
00:02:19,657 --> 00:02:21,367
Aw, okay, um, uh...

36
00:02:25,047 --> 00:02:28,297
I thought I gave him the
slip back in Avalon but uh,

37
00:02:28,332 --> 00:02:30,905
but I guess I, I ran into a herd,

38
00:02:30,913 --> 00:02:35,083
a few miles back and, I uh,
I guess they tracked me here.

39
00:02:36,212 --> 00:02:37,552
[Curtis] Tracked you?

40
00:02:37,554 --> 00:02:39,402
Yeah, you guys really
need to listen to me.

41
00:02:39,437 --> 00:02:41,251
There's, there's more of them, a lot more,

42
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,768
and they're coming!

43
00:02:42,803 --> 00:02:44,250
That's what they do!

44
00:02:44,253 --> 00:02:47,317
If one of them finds you, they uh,

45
00:02:47,352 --> 00:02:50,382
they attract a swarm of them, okay?

46
00:02:50,384 --> 00:02:51,804
[Curtis] And I have just
one or two more questions.

47
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,427
No no no, listen!

48
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,463
Look hey, I'm not here to argue with you,

49
00:02:55,498 --> 00:02:59,118
I'm here to tell you what to
do in order for us to survive!

50
00:02:59,123 --> 00:03:02,173
Okay doc, we'll follow your lead.

51
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:03,958
(zombies growling)

52
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:04,789
Okay.

53
00:03:05,898 --> 00:03:08,743
(clattering)

54
00:03:08,778 --> 00:03:10,358
Easy, easy, easy!

55
00:03:11,968 --> 00:03:13,958
What's the weapon situation like guys?

56
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:15,085
We have guns?

57
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:16,755
Huh, there wasn't time doc.

58
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,416
What's that supposed to mean?

59
00:03:18,422 --> 00:03:21,562
We have guns, they're
just locked up at my bunker.

60
00:03:21,597 --> 00:03:22,985
Well where's that?

61
00:03:22,991 --> 00:03:24,939
About 300 yards from here.

62
00:03:24,974 --> 00:03:26,850
[Eddie] (sighs) Well shit.

63
00:03:26,885 --> 00:03:29,765
[Curtis] I told you
that was a stupid idea.

64
00:03:29,773 --> 00:03:31,493
These zombies don't
seem to be too quick.

65
00:03:31,528 --> 00:03:33,087
Maybe I could make a run for it.

66
00:03:33,122 --> 00:03:34,647
- Alex!
- Don't be fooled man,

67
00:03:34,649 --> 00:03:37,529
these things will pick up speed
as soon as they get excited!

68
00:03:37,564 --> 00:03:40,306
Anything agitates them,
it'll, it'll flip a switch.

69
00:03:40,341 --> 00:03:41,675
There's just one.

70
00:03:41,683 --> 00:03:43,269
Yes, speaking of which.

71
00:03:43,304 --> 00:03:44,856
- Dad!
- What Nicole?

72
00:03:44,864 --> 00:03:45,944
I don't think you're gonna have enough

73
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:48,376
time to get to the bunker.

74
00:03:48,378 --> 00:03:50,208
What does that mean?

75
00:03:51,326 --> 00:03:55,486
(zombies growling)
(zombies snarling)

76
00:03:57,215 --> 00:04:01,375
- You saw how tough just one
was, we can't fight that many.

77
00:04:05,854 --> 00:04:07,295
I'm going for the guns.

78
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,736
No you're not Alex!

79
00:04:08,737 --> 00:04:10,227
[Alex] Gina it's the only way!

80
00:04:10,234 --> 00:04:12,764
What, and leave us here
to fight those things off?

81
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,816
Curtis, with three women and a cripple?

82
00:04:14,851 --> 00:04:19,021
She's right guys, we need
to keep all the muscle here.

83
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:20,892
I'll go.

84
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,730
[Curtis] Apple, you're not going.

85
00:04:26,883 --> 00:04:30,473
I'm the best chance
we've got, I'm going.

86
00:04:32,062 --> 00:04:35,062
She's right, it's our only choice.

87
00:04:39,013 --> 00:04:43,393
(zombies growling)
(zombies snarling)

88
00:04:43,394 --> 00:04:45,894
(tense music)

89
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:49,576
Okay, once you're through
the grove, turn west.

90
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,620
The entrance to the bunker
will be about 200 yards

91
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,094
from the side of the hill.

92
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:54,932
Ready!

93
00:05:01,654 --> 00:05:03,546
(clanking)

94
00:05:03,581 --> 00:05:05,439
(growling)

95
00:05:05,444 --> 00:05:06,284
Apple, go!

96
00:05:08,971 --> 00:05:11,450
(dramatic music)

97
00:05:11,485 --> 00:05:13,456
(zombie snarling)

98
00:05:13,491 --> 00:05:15,428
(Nicole squealing)

99
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,260
Nicole!

100
00:05:25,968 --> 00:05:28,878
(thumping)

101
00:05:28,881 --> 00:05:32,211
Nicole, Nicole, get to the bunker now!

102
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:34,259
(thumping)

103
00:05:34,261 --> 00:05:36,591
(squishing)

104
00:05:44,496 --> 00:05:45,496
Apple, go!

105
00:05:47,018 --> 00:05:49,098
Get Nicole to the bunker!

106
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,550
(zombies growling)
(zombies snarling)

107
00:06:02,306 --> 00:06:06,396
[Nicole] Are we supposed
to take all of them?

108
00:06:06,401 --> 00:06:08,481
As many as I can carry.

109
00:06:22,201 --> 00:06:24,241
This is a Ruger SR9 nine millimeter pistol

110
00:06:24,276 --> 00:06:27,006
with a laser scope on top.

111
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:28,545
Why are you giving me a gun?

112
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,043
Because no one else has.

113
00:06:30,078 --> 00:06:31,418
This isn't like your little video game,

114
00:06:31,453 --> 00:06:32,930
the TV shows you used to watch.

115
00:06:32,965 --> 00:06:35,465
You're going to be fighting
for your survival out there.

116
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,845
You're just making me
nervous, I'm not ready--

117
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,225
(mumbles) Look at me!

118
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:40,126
You have to be ready for this.

119
00:06:40,161 --> 00:06:44,581
Seriously though, I've
never killed anybody before!

120
00:06:44,584 --> 00:06:46,897
Neither had I until a few nights ago.

121
00:06:46,932 --> 00:06:48,612
Release the safety here
and pull back the chamber

122
00:06:48,614 --> 00:06:51,204
and load the rounds in, aim
at what you want to shoot at,

123
00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:52,995
and then, pull the trigger.

124
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,460
Pull the trigger?

125
00:06:54,461 --> 00:06:55,924
- Apple!
- Yeah.

126
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,388
Thank you.

127
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:02,819
This is all I could find.

128
00:07:02,854 --> 00:07:04,727
(thumping)

129
00:07:04,733 --> 00:07:08,723
(zombie growling)
- We got one in the kitchen!

130
00:07:08,758 --> 00:07:11,196
(Curtis growling)
(zombie growling)

131
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:14,855
(thumping)
Oh shit, oh shit!

132
00:07:16,147 --> 00:07:17,307
Get something!

133
00:07:20,498 --> 00:07:21,528
(Gina screaming)

134
00:07:21,529 --> 00:07:25,059

(mumbling)

136
00:07:28,034 --> 00:07:30,704
Ya!
(thumping)

137
00:07:35,187 --> 00:07:37,257
[Eddie] Zombies on the right!

138
00:07:37,292 --> 00:07:39,245
(zombies growling)

139
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,745
(tense music)

140
00:07:50,049 --> 00:07:51,969
[Alex] Ya, get out, get out!

141
00:07:51,973 --> 00:07:56,573
(scuffling)
(zombie growling)

142
00:07:56,608 --> 00:07:59,400
(gun firing)
Aah!

143
00:08:03,388 --> 00:08:04,768
Nicole?

144
00:08:04,771 --> 00:08:08,001
Like I told Mom, it's
the end of the world.

145
00:08:08,036 --> 00:08:09,656
What did you expect?

146
00:08:10,664 --> 00:08:13,584
(zombies growling)

147
00:08:15,606 --> 00:08:18,516
(muffled slamming)

148
00:08:20,457 --> 00:08:23,637
