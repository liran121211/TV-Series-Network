1
00:00:00,718 --> 00:00:03,388
(intense music)

2
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:27,020
(screen door creaking)

3
00:01:39,628 --> 00:01:43,048
Thank you, is that what you wanna hear?

4
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,350
What then, I'm not apologizing
for that, neither should you.

5
00:01:58,053 --> 00:02:00,893
Crazy fucker got what he deserved.

6
00:02:06,808 --> 00:02:08,888
They can act all shocked.

7
00:02:10,606 --> 00:02:15,090
If you hadn't pulled the
trigger, one of them would've.

8
00:02:15,415 --> 00:02:19,575
Maybe not today, maybe not
tomorrow but eventually.

9
00:02:23,335 --> 00:02:27,495
Eventually that crazy bastard
would've gotten to them all.

10
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,760
Give me a break, why
are you on their side?

11
00:02:41,648 --> 00:02:44,898
You know this isn't helping them right?

12
00:02:46,447 --> 00:02:49,447
All they know is gone, it's changed.

13
00:02:54,995 --> 00:02:57,405
I'm not here to make friends.

14
00:03:00,703 --> 00:03:04,123
For you, I'll be cordial, I'll play nice.

15
00:03:08,412 --> 00:03:10,412
I'm not anyone's friend.

16
00:03:20,306 --> 00:03:23,886
Whatever, you really
need to start talking.

17
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:29,519
This mind shit's getting old.

18
00:03:34,435 --> 00:03:38,725
(ax slamming against wood)

19
00:03:38,728 --> 00:03:41,398
(intense music)

20
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,410
(water pouring)

21
00:04:09,955 --> 00:04:12,115
Alex, are we gonna talk?

22
00:04:16,536 --> 00:04:18,286
I'm really not ready to, Jan.

23
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:21,510
And neither is your daughter
and I think that's bullshit.

24
00:04:21,545 --> 00:04:22,510
Now more than ever, we need to

25
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:24,471
rely on each other for support.

26
00:04:24,506 --> 00:04:26,429
I've got a lot to process.

27
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:29,601
I don't even know what
I'm gonna do about them.

28
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,145
That's why you have me.

29
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,687
It's not that simple, babe.

30
00:04:32,693 --> 00:04:35,066
It is, we're letting them stay.

31
00:04:35,101 --> 00:04:37,439
- Are you crazy?
- You married me

32
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:40,193
because you know I am, they stay.

33
00:04:42,606 --> 00:04:44,321
Whether you want to admit it or not,

34
00:04:44,356 --> 00:04:46,776
that girl killing David
was the right thing to do.

35
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:47,976
- Gina.
- This is where we

36
00:04:47,984 --> 00:04:51,323
are right now, Alex, a harsh
road of tough decisions

37
00:04:51,572 --> 00:04:54,662
ahead of us, each one more
difficult than the next.

38
00:04:54,697 --> 00:04:57,828
And the last thing we need is doubts.

39
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:01,633
My husband, the father of my
child doesn't have doubts.

40
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,455
He acts and he reacts.

41
00:05:05,335 --> 00:05:07,325
I'm trying to be a good man.

42
00:05:07,331 --> 00:05:10,661
You are a good man in a bad situation.

43
00:05:11,925 --> 00:05:14,585
(intense music)

44
00:05:22,186 --> 00:05:25,466
(screen door creaking)

45
00:05:25,472 --> 00:05:28,142
(intense music)

46
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:34,914
I've agreed to let you two stay.

47
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:38,999
Well, we appreciate
that, dibs on the couch.

48
00:05:39,034 --> 00:05:41,245
There will be some concessions made.

49
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,997
- Such as?
- The guns.

50
00:05:45,405 --> 00:05:48,065
Hand them over.
- Absolutely not.

51
00:05:51,746 --> 00:05:55,906
- It's non-negotiable.
- Try and take 'em from me.

52
00:06:01,036 --> 00:06:04,326
- They'll go in my lock
up with my other guns.

53
00:06:04,332 --> 00:06:07,404
Neither one of us will be carrying until

54
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:10,476
we both feel comfortable with each other.

55
00:06:10,483 --> 00:06:12,363
Who's got the only key, I wonder.

56
00:06:12,398 --> 00:06:13,861
You can have it.

57
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:20,093
I'm trying to double cross you, Curtis.

58
00:06:20,128 --> 00:06:22,907
I'm trying to make sure neither one of us

59
00:06:22,911 --> 00:06:27,081
gets heated enough to recreate
last night, work with me.

60
00:06:31,972 --> 00:06:36,142
(sighs)
(intense music)

61
00:06:41,388 --> 00:06:44,232
(door creaking)

62
00:06:44,267 --> 00:06:46,597
You got enough guns, Alex?

63
00:06:47,563 --> 00:06:51,733
- Always be prepared.
(intense music)

64
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:26,250
For the record, this is a bad idea.

65
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:30,708
(intense music)

66
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,643
(door creaking shut)

67
00:07:37,678 --> 00:07:40,246
(rustling leaves)

68
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,964
So where are you guys from?

69
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:46,999
How long have you guys lived here?

70
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:50,961
Quite some time now,
actually I'm from Jamecula.

71
00:07:50,996 --> 00:07:53,051
Now Gina, she's an Islander.

72
00:07:53,086 --> 00:07:56,286
Her parents originally owned this place.

73
00:07:56,294 --> 00:07:58,064
Yeah, we lived here for
a few years and then my

74
00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:01,047
parents took us back to Avalon.

75
00:08:01,051 --> 00:08:04,471
[Limping Man] Anybody
in the fuckin' house?

76
00:08:04,506 --> 00:08:05,471
(slamming on door)

77
00:08:05,473 --> 00:08:07,370
Is anybody in there?
- What the hell?

78
00:08:07,405 --> 00:08:09,268
- Let me in please.
- Expecting someone?

79
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:12,531
(intense music)

80
00:08:12,566 --> 00:08:14,726
[Limping Man] Open up, please.

81
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,900
- Alex.
- Please let me in.

82
00:08:16,902 --> 00:08:19,493
They're coming.
- Who's coming, pal?

83
00:08:19,528 --> 00:08:22,738
Who do you think, just
open the door for God's sake.

84
00:08:22,773 --> 00:08:24,028
We can't leave him out there.

85
00:08:24,029 --> 00:08:26,199
- Oh, yes we can.
- No, we can't.

86
00:08:26,203 --> 00:08:27,836
(sighs)

87
00:08:27,871 --> 00:08:30,882
- Jesus Christ.
- Thank God.

88
00:08:30,917 --> 00:08:32,827
Shut the door, they're following me.

89
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,883
They're right behind me.
- Hey, calm down.

90
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:36,838
[Limping Man] Shut the door
before it's too late, man.

91
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,920
(ferocious growling)

92
00:08:42,994 --> 00:08:45,084
What the, what is that?

93
00:08:47,308 --> 00:08:51,478
(grunting)
(growling)

94
00:08:57,525 --> 00:09:00,275
(intense music)
