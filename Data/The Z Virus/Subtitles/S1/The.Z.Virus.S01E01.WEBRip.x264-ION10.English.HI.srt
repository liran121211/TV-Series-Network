1
00:00:00,329 --> 00:00:02,829
(tense music)

2
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:56,006
(banging)

3
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,400
(groaning)

4
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:32,079
(screaming)

5
00:02:38,973 --> 00:02:41,323
Twin Pines Ranch, come in.

6
00:02:41,358 --> 00:02:44,073
(static buzzing)

7
00:02:52,273 --> 00:02:54,443
Twin Pines Ranch, come in.

8
00:02:58,365 --> 00:02:59,775
Alex, are you up?

9
00:03:07,431 --> 00:03:09,101
I'm going out there.

10
00:03:16,899 --> 00:03:18,182
Someone's outside,

11
00:03:18,217 --> 00:03:22,377
and I just can't sit in here
anymore not knowing anything.

12
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,785
(intense music)

13
00:03:54,813 --> 00:03:55,811
Why'd you go outside?

14
00:03:55,846 --> 00:04:00,006
You were so safe in there,
you had everything you needed.

15
00:04:02,012 --> 00:04:05,932
'Cause 60 days alone in
a bunker fucking sucks.

16
00:05:05,337 --> 00:05:07,747
(gun firing)

17
00:07:41,431 --> 00:07:43,261
Back off, tough guy!

18
00:07:45,763 --> 00:07:46,716
Are you deaf?

19
00:07:46,751 --> 00:07:49,461
I'll fucking kill you, man!

20
00:07:49,462 --> 00:07:51,882
(screaming)
