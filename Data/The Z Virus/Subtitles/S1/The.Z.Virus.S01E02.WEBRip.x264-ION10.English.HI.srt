1
00:00:00,688 --> 00:00:03,438
(dramatic music)

2
00:01:06,837 --> 00:01:09,837
(explosion booming)

3
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:16,961
(glass shattering)
(electricity zapping)

4
00:01:32,395 --> 00:01:34,175
[Girl] Dad?

5
00:01:34,182 --> 00:01:36,952
[Woman] It's okay, sweetie.

6
00:01:36,954 --> 00:01:39,794
(heavy breathing)

7
00:01:49,395 --> 00:01:52,135
[Radio] The Windpines
Ranch, this is Cabrillo High.

8
00:01:52,136 --> 00:01:53,236
Do you copy?

9
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:55,009
AJ, do you copy?

10
00:01:55,011 --> 00:01:56,400
Are you alive?

11
00:01:56,435 --> 00:01:57,789
David, it's me.

12
00:02:00,657 --> 00:02:01,831
We're all safe.

13
00:02:01,866 --> 00:02:03,006
The bunker held up.

14
00:02:03,014 --> 00:02:04,794
[David] That's good to hear.

15
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:07,077
So what do we do now?

16
00:02:07,112 --> 00:02:08,237
Now we wait.

17
00:02:40,689 --> 00:02:43,859
(electricity zapping)

18
00:03:14,674 --> 00:03:15,514
Okay then.

19
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:19,945
Let's get out of here.

20
00:03:26,374 --> 00:03:28,544
Are you sure about this?

21
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,040
No I'm not.

22
00:03:35,366 --> 00:03:36,286
Dad!

23
00:03:36,287 --> 00:03:38,117
What about Mr. Wilson?

24
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,390
We haven't heard from David in days.

25
00:03:45,822 --> 00:03:47,442
Either his radio is down or--

26
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,271
He went outside too.

27
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,340
You guys get your mask on.

28
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:04,167
It's time.

29
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:24,739
(heavy breathing)

30
00:04:37,282 --> 00:04:40,032
(wind whistling)

31
00:06:33,846 --> 00:06:36,676
(heavy breathing)

32
00:06:58,972 --> 00:07:01,222
(shouting)

33
00:07:12,973 --> 00:07:15,223
(groaning)

34
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,402
Dad, watch out!

35
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,460
Apple, gun!

36
00:07:30,423 --> 00:07:32,013
Back off tough guy.

37
00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:34,729
Are you fucking deaf?

38
00:07:36,128 --> 00:07:37,458
I will kill you.

39
00:07:41,841 --> 00:07:44,171
(gun fires)

40
00:07:45,975 --> 00:07:48,225
(groaning)

41
00:07:58,346 --> 00:07:59,176
David?

42
00:08:04,144 --> 00:08:06,686
No one's killing anyone.

43
00:08:06,721 --> 00:08:08,519
We got way worse things out here

44
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,318
to worry about than each other.
