00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:12,470
Shocking revelations today
about BoJack Horseman's involvement

2
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:14,514
in the overdose of Sarah Lynn,

3
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:17,475
in an explosive new
"Hollywoo Reporter" exposé.

4
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:20,103
Is BoJack #canceled?

5
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:23,106
#Find-out-tonight
when the horse himself sits down...

6
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:25,775
On "Braxby Means Business
with Biscuits Braxby,"

7
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,070
BoJack Horseman opens up
in an exclusive interview.

8
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:30,488
For the first time ever,

9
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:34,409
we'll hear the real story
of the last days of Sarah Lynn.

10
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:35,660
I don't believe it.

11
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,912
I left shoe leather
in six different states

12
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,497
and spun the scoop of my career

13
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:42,834
all to get sidetracked by a sit-down
with a second-rate celebrity suck-up.

14
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:46,046
Relax. Your story's clearly
doing something

15
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:48,923
if they're scrambling
to do damage control so fast.

16
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:52,093
That's just it, Patience,
my sister and lifelong confidante.

17
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,970
These schmoozey charlatans will pour syrup

18
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,140
all over this stack of Shinola
and try to tell you it's pancakes.

19
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:58,600
And I'm powerless to prevent it!

20
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:00,810
Don't you have enough dirt
for a whole other story?

21
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,313
You know full well
once I become Baxter's bride,

22
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,732
I'm trading board rooms for bedrooms,
watches for swatches

23
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,442
and deadlines for bedtimes.

24
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:10,153
Okay, so then get married and forget
about this BoJack story.

25
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,030
I mean, who cares, right?

26
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:14,616
Patience, you cut to the core
like a classic Sinclair.

27
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:17,539
I shall miss making mincemeat
of the misdeeds of mischievous miscreants,

28
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:21,915
but I must focus on my new mission,
as I transition from miss to missus.

29
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,877
Why do you talk like that?
We're from Fresno.

30
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:26,146
Huh, they're really hyping up
this BoJack interview.

31
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:29,023
I gotta admit I'm kinda curious.
You're gonna watch, right?

32
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:32,402
No. I can't waste my energy
getting worked up about that guy, Guy.

33
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,654
I've done enough of that.
Like, years of that.

34
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:37,174
- Yeah, but it's not like you can just...
- I need to work on my book.

35
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,659
These mall-related mysteries
aren't gonna solve themselves.

36
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,703
Spoken like a very emotionally
healthy woman,

37
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:44,747
productive professional writer
and super-cute girlfriend.

38
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,431
We already know what BoJack's gonna say.

39
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,644
He'll admit to everything in the story,
but nothing else.

40
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,313
He'll trot out this sad-sack routine,
everyone will feel bad for him.

41
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,439
He'll talk about his addictions.

42
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:54,024
"Showbiz is awful.
My parents were abusive."

43
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:56,110
He'll say he's changed.
That he's not that guy anymore.

44
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:59,095
- Yeah. You sound real done with it.
- I am! I'm just saying.

45
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,532
They'll make you feel bad for him,
without it being too sad...

46
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:05,602
...because too sad is a bring-down.
We wanna shoot for pensive.

47
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,454
And this will keep you
from talking with your hands,

48
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,189
which can be construed as aggressive.

49
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:13,401
And whatever you do, don't get defensive!
Don't deny anything, and don't argue.

50
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:15,153
Give me a smile.

51
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,321
Uh...

52
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:19,282
Whoa! Am I my third favorite
Bruce Springsteen song

53
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:22,410
because I was not "Born in the USA"
nor am I "Tougher Than the Rest,"

54
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:25,663
but I am "Blinded By the Light"!
Nice smile, buddy.

55
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,067
Do you need to be here right now?

56
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:30,501
Since your interview is leading
into the season finale of "Birthday Dad,"

57
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:34,422
I wanted to officially welcome you
to the MBN Thursday Night family.

58
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:35,506
Thank you.

59
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,610
And to ask if it wouldn't be
too much trouble for you

60
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,969
to shout out "Birthday Dad"
during your interview?

61
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,281
- Why would I...
- But only if the interview is going well.

62
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:46,184
If the interview is going poorly,
please do not bring up "Birthday Dad."

63
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:48,603
Hey, Princess Carolyn, I... Oh. BoJack.

64
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:50,438
- Getting ready for the interview?
- Yeah.

65
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:55,068
Oh! You've got your work cut out for you,
because people hate you right now.

66
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,779
- I'm aware, thank you.
- That story... Wow.

67
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,072
Really well-written, huh?

68
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:02,200
Yeah, the power of the prose
was not the first thing I noticed.

69
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,451
Haunting.

70
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,246
Anyway, Princess Carolyn,

71
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:09,165
is it cool if I take tomorrow night off
for a date with Maude?

72
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,418
Todd, I keep hearing about
this new girlfriend of yours.

73
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,336
When do I meet her?

74
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,047
You can probably take this part
of the conversation elsewhere.

75
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:16,965
Right this way.

76
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,092
We should go on a double date
with you and Pickles!

77
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,844
Pickles and I are putting our relaysh
on a brief hiate at the mo,

78
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,697
but as soon as she returns
from her work trip...

79
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:24,555
Uh, oh!

80
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,103
Excuse me, I'm receiving a text message
and it appears we have broken up forever.

81
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,148
- You're gonna be great.
- Yeah. Where are we doing this?

82
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,484
I got them to take the "Philbert" set
out of storage.

83
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:37,402
Why?

84
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,904
Because we want the intimacy
and vulnerability of your home.

85
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,991
You're saying, "This is me. No more lies."

86
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:45,076
But since we're pre-taping it
in the afternoon,

87
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,304
we're using the set to make it look
like it's nighttime.

88
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:48,328
Makes sense.

89
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,920
I'm here with BoJack Horseman
in his actual house.

90
00:04:56,004 --> 00:05:00,174
BoJack, a story came out this morning
about the last days of Sarah Lynn.

91
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,843
How did it make you feel?

92
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:05,138
Honestly? I felt relieved
that now I can stop lying.

93
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,477
- Are the allegations in the story true?
- They are.

94
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:14,522
Sarah Lynn was nine months sober.
I invited her on a bender.

95
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:17,817
We spiraled together for a little over
a month and then she overdosed.

96
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,902
On heroin you purchased for her?

97
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,756
- Well, I didn't purchase it for her...
- There's no need to get defensive.

98
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,020
I'm just trying to be accurate.

99
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:26,451
I-I didn't purchase it at all.
I just had it.

100
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,703
You just had heroin?
Lying around.

101
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,097
No, no, no, no, not <i>lying around.</i>

102
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,332
You're making it sound
like I had extra heroin,

103
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,125
because I do so much heroin.

104
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:37,295
I had that heroin
because I wasn't doing heroin.

105
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,130
So, I had it. You understand?

106
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:42,508
In your original statement to the police,
you said she called you,

107
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:46,095
you came to the planetarium and found her.
That was a lie.

108
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:47,597
Yes.

109
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,600
Would you say Sarah Lynn dying
was your rock bottom?

110
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,602
I don't believe in rock bottoms.

111
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,855
I've had a lot of what I thought
were rock bottoms only to discover

112
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:59,650
- another rockier bottom underneath.
- That sounds dangerous.

113
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:03,237
Eventually, I decided to stop waiting
for something to change me.

114
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:06,074
I had to make the change myself.
And that's why I went to rehab.

115
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,284
And I'm very proud to be one year sober
next month.

116
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,928
So, if I'm understanding you correctly,

117
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:12,914
Sarah Lynn dying
was part of that decision?

118
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:17,251
Uh, it was part of it, yes.
Uh, I've made a lot of mistakes.

119
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,504
Can you share some of those
other mistakes?

120
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:22,590
I... I don't think
that it would be fair to the people

121
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:26,260
who were affected by those mistakes,
all of whom I've apologized to in private.

122
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,345
Now that you're sober,

123
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:29,555
do you think you'll stop
making these mistakes?

124
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,224
I do. It's been a lot of work,

125
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:34,811
but I look back at that other BoJack
and I think, "Who is that?"

126
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,312
And who was he?

127
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,940
I came from a broken home,

128
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:41,943
and I used to feel like my whole life
was an acting job.

129
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:44,779
Just doing an impression of the people
I saw on television,

130
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:49,450
which was just the projection of a bunch
of equally screwed-up writers and actors.

131
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:53,371
I felt like a Xerox of a Xerox
of a person, you know what I mean?

132
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:57,667
- But not anymore?
- No. Now I feel like me.

133
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,835
It must have been difficult

134
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,587
to see those same patterns
repeat themselves with Sarah Lynn.

135
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:04,340
I think that's why her death
was so scary for me,

136
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:10,012
why I didn't wanna confront it,
because she reminded me of myself.

137
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,723
Some have accused Sarah Lynn's mother
of exploiting her death.

138
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:16,018
When you hear "All Twerk and No Play"
in a Geico commercial,

139
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,981
or see Sarah Lynn's face on a billboard
with the slogan "I'd die for a Pepsi,"

140
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:23,651
- how does that make you feel?
- Sad. Angry.

141
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:25,421
Honestly, it feels like
that's what killed her.

142
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,779
Not the heroin?

143
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:29,115
No, you're right.
It was mostly the heroin.

144
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:32,368
If you could talk to her mother now,
what would you say to her?

145
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:36,497
I would say... I wish you could know...

146
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,710
how sorry I am.

147
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:47,508
- Am I crazy or did I nail that?
- It was good.

148
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,760
Oh, man, when she brought up
Sarah Lynn's mother?

149
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,888
She was setting me up
to throw her under the bus,

150
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,514
but then I said I'm sorry?

151
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:57,685
I mean, that was a sweet move, yeah?
I felt like I could see <i>The Matrix!</i>

152
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,896
You've definitely gotten
your 10,000 hours in

153
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,481
when it comes to apologizing.

154
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,733
It was good, right?
People are gonna like it?

155
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:07,778
Yeah, well, we'll find out in three hours
when it airs.

156
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,158
And that's why the band Chicago

157
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:15,036
is not one of the top ten Chicago bands
of all time.

158
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:16,662
Uh-huh.

159
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,666
Hmm, it's okay
if you wanna watch. All right?

160
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,186
He's your friend, it's a big deal for him.

161
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,630
- You don't have to be so weird about it.
- I'm not being weird. I'm in a good place.

162
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:28,007
I don't wanna get dragged back
into that other stuff.

163
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,468
That's great! But, you know,
it is a little weird

164
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,196
that one of your best friends
is a huge celebrity

165
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,365
- and you never wanna talk about him.
- Roxy's really more my "best" best friend.

166
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,867
But you never talk about Roxy either!

167
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:39,531
I don't understand what her job is
and it's too late for me to ask.

168
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,562
And you were also married
to a huge celebrity.

169
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:42,915
And you never talk about him either.

170
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,334
You don't share your past life with me.
You wanna talk about weird?

171
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,319
I've lived here six months
and I still haven't met your son.

172
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:51,948
Okay. But you don't really
wanna meet Sonny.

173
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,199
Of course I do!

174
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:54,843
All right, cool.
Let's get dinner tomorrow.

175
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,118
"Tomorrow" tomorrow?

176
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,427
Huh.

177
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,811
I saw your interview, BoJack.

178
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:25,064
As a recovering addict myself,
I was spellbound!

179
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,524
Wow. I had no idea.

180
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:29,610
And I see no reason
why you shouldn't return to Wesleyan.

181
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:32,780
Uh, small latte?

182
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,633
- My manager told me not to charge you.
- What?

183
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,301
He said he watched
your interview last night,

184
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,577
then turned off the TV

185
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,787
and went straight
to his first AA meeting.

186
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,788
Huh.

187
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,623
No "Birthday Dad."

188
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,626
- So, I nailed it.
- You kidding?

189
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,962
- Pinky Penguin, line one.
- Pinky!

190
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,088
Princess Carolyn!

191
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:51,716
You delivered MBN
the best ratings we've seen in years!

192
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:55,136
You just bought us six more months
of not having to sell ourselves

193
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:59,056
to a larger media company
that strips us for office furniture.

194
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,185
BoJack and I
were just talking about all the buzz.

195
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:06,022
I wanna strike while the iron is hot
and do a part two tonight.

196
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,898
- Part two?
- There is no part two.

197
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:11,819
It's right there in the title,
"The Last Days of Sarah Lynn."

198
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,571
Just sit down with Biscuits again

199
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:17,074
and tell a few more colorful anecdotes
from your years partying in Hollywoo.

200
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:20,745
Then, an encore presentation
of the "Birthday Dad" finale.

201
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:21,662
Makes sense.

202
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:24,266
We got what we wanted out of this.
I don't think we should push it.

203
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,418
We're starting a dialogue.
I'm helping people.

204
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:30,713
Move over, Sad Dog.
Make room for Remorse Horse!

205
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:31,857
That's great BoJack, but...

206
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,675
Listen, I'm ready to move on
and go back to Connecticut,

207
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,386
but it does feel good to be part
of the conversation again.

208
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,765
And if my openness and candor
about addiction is helping people,

209
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:43,976
then I'm kind of a dick
if I don't do another interview, right?

210
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,897
<i>I mean, I wasn't gonna say it.</i>

211
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,484
Thank you so much for inviting us
into your home

212
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,653
- for another night of questions.
- Are you kidding?

213
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,530
You couldn't keep me away!
Because this is my house.

214
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,159
I wanna start
with another Sarah Lynn question.

215
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:02,036
Oh, here we go.

216
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,622
Speaking of addicts,
I think you're addicted to Sarah Lynn!

217
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:07,541
You told the police
you weren't with her when she died.

218
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,418
That she called you from the planetarium.

219
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,628
Yes, I lied.

220
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,106
Weren't you afraid the police would check
the phone records?

221
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:16,717
Oh! Well, I wasn't thinking clearly.
Guess I'm not a criminal mastermind!

222
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,928
But the police did check
the phone records,

223
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,179
and your story checked out.

224
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:23,474
There was a two-minute phone call
made from her phone to your phone,

225
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:26,435
17 minutes before you called 911.

226
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,979
- Oh?
- If you were with her,

227
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,148
- how do you explain the phone call?
- I, um...

228
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,609
I called myself.

229
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:37,446
After I realized what had had happened,
I took her phone and I called myself

230
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,490
so I could make it look like
she called me.

231
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:41,325
- Why?
- I went into panic mode.

232
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,618
And then what did you do?

233
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,221
I thought we were gonna talk
about other stuff.

234
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,831
What did you do after you called
your own phone, BoJack?

235
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,833
I went outside to the parking lot.

236
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:52,128
And you just waited there for 17 minutes?

237
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,255
Why are you asking about this?

238
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:59,427
Biscuits Braxby.
Paige Sinclair. You've been had.

239
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,595
A pleasure to meet you. Had by who?

240
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,513
The pleasure is mine,

241
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:04,436
the pronoun is whom,
and the whom is the horse.

242
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:07,560
BoJack? I got him to spill his guts
about the worst moment of his life

243
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:09,937
on national television for huge ratings.

244
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,189
Your disgusting display
of soft-pedaling sycophancy

245
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,608
made me wanna quit
the journalism business altogether,

246
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,152
two days prior to when I get married

247
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,955
and quit the journalism
business altogether.

248
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:20,614
But the Biscuits Braxby brand
is keeping things light.

249
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,825
Celebs come on my show
because I make 'em look good.

250
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,618
That access keeps me relevant.

251
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,203
But to what benefit is your relevance

252
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,497
if it's squandered
in the service of public relations?

253
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,725
With the advent of social media,

254
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,709
celebs don't need you
to make them look good.

255
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:34,879
And if you don't alter your strategy soon,
you'll have no career left to save.

256
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:37,006
Face it, chinchilla, you're all wet.

257
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,132
Well, I...

258
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:42,636
Ugh! Even if I wanted to do a hard-hitting
interview, what would I say?

259
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,722
I've a few ideas...

260
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:48,309
- You keep looking over to your manager.
- Well, I...

261
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,728
- Can we talk about your relationship?
- Princess Carolyn?

262
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:53,355
- You dated her for seven years?
- Yes, and look! She's alive.

263
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,815
Did it ever get complicated,

264
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,943
working with her while maintaining
a sexual relationship?

265
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,147
Well, she's always been good

266
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,405
at keeping her personal
and professional lives separate.

267
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,616
- Quite an accomplished woman.
- You said it.

268
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,618
She was an agent's assistant
when I met her

269
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:09,455
and now she's running her own company.
Plus, she's a great mom.

270
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,582
Oh, fish! Mom!

271
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:14,585
- I forgot about Todd's date!
- I can watch Ruthie for a few hours.

272
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:15,668
Thank you.

273
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:18,130
What can you tell me
about Marcy Jerominek?

274
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,894
- Who?
- In the '90s, you had a fan club...

275
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,360
- How do you know all this?
- Do you know where I'm going here?

276
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:25,471
Marcy. Yes.
She was the president of my fan club.

277
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:26,847
You slept with her.

278
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:30,768
We had a lovely evening together.
We both got something out of it, and...

279
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:33,312
Did you take a high school girl
to her prom?

280
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,457
- That was a family friend.
- Did you help a teen mom

281
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,359
sneak out of rehab
and take her to a high school party?

282
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,319
I didn't <i>take</i> her. We went together.

283
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:41,722
Is it true you once dated a woman

284
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,697
who'd just woken up
from a 30-year coma?

285
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,867
- Were you attracted to her naiveté, too?
- What does all this have to with...

286
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,831
You had sex with the president
of your fan club.

287
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:52,331
You had sex with your agent's assistant.
You party with underage girls.

288
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,500
- You don't see a pattern here?
- It's not a pattern.

289
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,312
- Do you enjoy having power over women?
- I don't even know what that means.

290
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,630
You don't know what it means
to have power over women?

291
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:02,967
I don't have power over anyone.
I barely have power over myself.

292
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:07,137
But you do have power over people.
And again and again, you abuse that power.

293
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,974
All these women that you mentioned,
I never forced myself...

294
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:12,852
Not through force,
but you understand the power differential.

295
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:16,105
So, I can't be with any woman
I might have power over?

296
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,625
- Who does that leave me with?
- I'm just pointing out a series of...

297
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,360
You think everything
is this nefarious scheme.

298
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,404
Most of the bad shit
that happens in this world

299
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,698
isn't because of wicked plots
and machinations.

300
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:28,576
It's just because we're all
a bunch of stupid, hungry,

301
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,744
horny little goons just grabbing at shit,

302
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:33,539
hoping it'll press that little button
in our brain that says,

303
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:37,626
"Okay, you're happy now."
That's not an "abuse of power."

304
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:41,755
Do you really believe you didn't have
the power in all of those relationships?

305
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,300
I... I am an addict.

306
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,595
One of the first things that I had
to accept was my own powerlessness.

307
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,489
- But that's...
- I understand what I did was wrong.

308
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:51,867
I'm not denying that.
But you're trying to paint this picture.

309
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,393
You're making it out like I'm a bad guy,
and I'm not.

310
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,145
I'm not that guy you're saying I am.

311
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,564
- So, back to Sarah Lynn...
- No. Why?

312
00:14:58,647 --> 00:14:59,690
You gave her the heroin...

313
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:02,192
I already told you, yes.
How many times can I say it?

314
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,987
Breaking news! The thing I told you
yesterday is still true.

315
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,197
- Did you ever give Sarah Lynn alcohol?
- What?

316
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:11,869
The first time Sarah Lynn ever got drunk,
she was a child, and it was vodka, right?

317
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:13,662
How... how do you know about that?

318
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,707
You were bringing vodka
to the set of "Horsin' Around."

319
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:20,336
Who told you all this stuff?
Did Sharona tell you that?

320
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,716
Doctor Champ,
thank you for returning my call.

321
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,051
I didn't wanna say anything,

322
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,470
but just watching BoJack
in that interview,

323
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,513
talking like he's a victim in all this.

324
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,600
If the world only knew the things
I know...

325
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,352
I understand as a therapist,

326
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:39,396
you're not at liberty to divulge
what your client told you in confidence.

327
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,608
But I'm not a therapist.
I'm a therapy horse.

328
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,401
And I can tell you everything.

329
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,485
Oh.

330
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:48,739
Because Sharona was a drunk, too,
so you can't trust a thing she says.

331
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:52,368
Obviously, she has a vendetta against me.
Besides, I already apologized to her.

332
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,452
Apologized for what?

333
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,330
Okay, when you put it all together,
it looks bad.

334
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:59,583
Do you see any connection between
those other women and Sarah Lynn?

335
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:02,544
There's no connection between anyone,
that's what I keep saying!

336
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,880
Sarah Lynn wasn't like those other girls.

337
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:08,217
I loved Sarah Lynn.
She was like a daughter to me.

338
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,053
I just keep seeing this story of you
taking young women...

339
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,012
- No.
- Grooming them...

340
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,889
I didn't <i>groom</i> anyone, okay?

341
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,557
It's not like I got Sarah Lynn drunk

342
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,321
for the purpose
of taking advantage of her.

343
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:20,229
She was ten! I didn't even have sex
with her until she was 30!

344
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,231
- I'm sorry, what?
- No. I just mean that...

345
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:25,901
- Did you say you had sex with her?
- That was later. She was an adult.

346
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,779
And we were both so drunk and high,
I didn't...

347
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,215
We didn't know what we were doing.

348
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,079
We were addicts,
and the thing about addicts...

349
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:35,160
- This was during your bender?
- Yeah. No! A different bender.

350
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:38,080
I took her to rehab, by the way!
I tried to get her help.

351
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,749
I just keep thinking
about those 17 minutes.

352
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:44,044
You waiting in the parking lot
after she died.

353
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:47,339
But she wasn't actually dead yet.
She died in the hospital.

354
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,985
- Right, but at the time, I didn't...
- Ever wonder what would've happened

355
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,928
if you didn't take those 17 minutes?
Do you think she might still...

356
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,723
No! I... Look, obviously
when I did all that stuff, I wasn't...

357
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:59,560
So to recap, you gave Sarah Lynn alcohol
when she was a child.

358
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:00,978
She then became an addict.

359
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:02,747
Come on, there was a lot of stuff
in between...

360
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,940
I'm talking now. You're not talking.

361
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,317
When she was intoxicated,
you had sex with her,

362
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:10,487
and when she was sober,
you gave her the heroin that killed her.

363
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,448
Then in an effort to cover for yourself,

364
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:16,285
you waited to call the paramedics
that might have saved her life.

365
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:20,414
And you don't think
you have any power over women.

366
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:26,420
So, it didn't go great.

367
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,213
The gross part is she doesn't even care.

368
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:31,800
This is just a ratings win she can use
as leverage for her next big paycheck.

369
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,278
- Maybe.
- She was all over the place.

370
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,721
I think people are gonna see
that she was just out to get me.

371
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:38,557
- People are gonna see that, right?
- I guess we'll find out tonight.

372
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,309
Okay, maybe she had some good points,

373
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,978
but she completely
undermined herself with, like...

374
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,481
I mean, we dated for like seven years.

375
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,399
Do you think that I took advantage of you?

376
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,336
- I'm here, aren't I?
- And she kept bringing it back to women...

377
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,238
These "women I hurt"
because that's what's hip now, right?

378
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:56,325
Hurting women?
But I have also hurt a lot of men!

379
00:17:56,408 --> 00:18:00,370
I told you to do just the one interview
and go back to Connecticut.

380
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:04,333
But it's gonna be okay, right?

381
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,418
You wanna grab some tacos?
What do you think?

382
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,004
I think you have three hours...

383
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:12,216
...before this interview airs
and your world changes completely.

384
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:15,010
You should think about
how you wanna spend that time.

385
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,054
I'm going home to my daughter.

386
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:31,568
- Sonny! It's great to finally meet you.
- Hey.

387
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,113
- Sonny! Come on!
- Good evening, ma'am.

388
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,531
Whoa!

389
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,990
What's this? You made varsity?

390
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,116
Yeah. Coach moved me up
for the rest of the season.

391
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,745
- Wow! Congratulations!
- That's amazing! Why didn't you tell me?

392
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,163
I wanted to wait for the jacket.

393
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,373
I'm so proud of you, buddy.

394
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,518
We should get Chicago-style cheese fries
to celebrate.

395
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,302
- Oh! I'll get...
- I'm getting cheese fries.

396
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,005
- So... lacrosse.
- What's your deal?

397
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,424
- What?
- My dad has a thing for broken women.

398
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:57,636
Then he nurses them back to health,
and when they're better they leave.

399
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:58,595
You gonna leave him?

400
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:02,015
- Does your dad think I'm gonna leave him?
- It doesn't matter, because eventually

401
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,017
my mom and dad
are gonna get back together.

402
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:04,935
They're still in love.

403
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,771
- What? No, they hate each other.
- No, they don't.

404
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:10,899
- They fight all the time.
- Wha... Really?

405
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,527
Oh! Whoa!

406
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,738
- My dad hates my mom?
- Uh... No! Of course not!

407
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,658
Then why would you say that?
You're so mean!

408
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,453
I was gone for two minutes!

409
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,839
Huh.

410
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:50,564
Ah.

411
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:54,860
Is this anything?

412
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,738
"My girlfriend was upset
I gave her a CD for Christmas.

413
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:00,324
But she gave me VD for Hanukkah!"

414
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:03,493
That's nothing.
And possibly anti-Semitic. Hold still.

415
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,579
Ugh! I am so ready
to never do stand-up again.

416
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,223
Are you gonna put me
on your TV show or what?

417
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:09,041
I'm telling you, the network loves you.

418
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,835
They just need you to do a screen test.
It's basically a formality.

419
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,254
- Screen test?
- What, you're too good for it?

420
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:17,841
No, it's cool! A screen test! Ha!

421
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:20,344
You wanna hit Alma's after the show?
Best tacos in LA.

422
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,346
- I keep telling you it's Neptune's Net.
- Ugh!

423
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,556
Malibu is for pretentious,
rich douchebags.

424
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,640
That's Beverly Hills.

425
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:28,560
Malibu is for pretentious
famous douchebags.

426
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,188
- Hold still so I can finish.
- Finish what?

427
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:34,233
Look, you might never get a star
on the Walk of Fame or a wax statue.

428
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:40,656
But this way you'll always be immortalized
and undisturbed in Hollywood forever.

429
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,157
Unless they repaint.

430
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:46,370
Anybody from out of town?
It's a trick question, it's LA.

431
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,306
Everybody's from out of town.

432
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,207
Most of Los Angeles
isn't even in Los Angeles.

433
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,584
I mean, Azusa? Excusa?

434
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,047
Oh, my God.

435
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,387
- Hey, man. I hated your show.
- What?

436
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,056
- "Horsin' Around." Hated it.
- Yeah, that's a hell of an opener.

437
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,557
But my baby brother loved it.

438
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,309
I'd be in my bedroom, sulking

439
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:12,354
and I'd hear him laughing his ass off
in the living room.

440
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,730
He had this great laugh.

441
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:17,484
Drugs took a lot from him,
but he still had that laugh.

442
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:18,986
Right up to the end.

443
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:23,740
Now anytime I hear anything about
that show, I hear my brother's laugh.

444
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:27,577
- Thanks for that.
- Well, shit. You're welcome.

445
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:29,496
Hey, do you wanna go up?

446
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:32,499
Oh, man. I...
I haven't done stand-up in years.

447
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:35,460
You're famous. They'll get
a kick out of it even if you suck.

448
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,839
I don't think so.
Thanks, though.

449
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:46,638
Oh.

450
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,601
Mm-mm. No.

451
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:54,187
- Hmm. Oh, what about this show?
- Oh, what's it about?

452
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,105
It's really smart.

453
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:57,733
It's about New Orleans and jazz
and Hurricane Katrina

454
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,443
and drugs and John Goodman.

455
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,153
- Sounds exciting.
- It's not!

456
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:04,156
Maude? I heard a man's voice!

457
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:07,034
- Yeah, Mom, Todd's over!
- Is that a burglar?

458
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,328
He's my boyfriend! We're gonna watch TV!

459
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,121
No shows about burglars, though!

460
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,707
- You got it, Mom!
- And keep the door open.

461
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:17,044
- No funny business!
- Okay, Mom.

462
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,522
Wanna watch the second part
of the BoJack interview?

463
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:20,881
I don't know.

464
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:23,925
That guy was my best friend
for like five years.

465
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,303
But not because we have anything
in common.

466
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:28,513
I just landed at his house one night.

467
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,783
You ever get tired of living
at the mercy of whoever happens

468
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,076
to let you crash on their couch?

469
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,078
- What do you mean?
- Why don't you get your own place?

470
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:36,164
Princess Carolyn doesn't need
a live-in nanny anymore.

471
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,481
I think I'd get lonely.

472
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:40,275
How about this:
what if you had your own place,

473
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,735
but you shared it with someone?

474
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,862
- Like a roommate?
- Or a girlfriend.

475
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:47,240
But Maude,
you're my girlfriend.

476
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:48,533
What am I supposed to do?

477
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,911
Get a second girlfriend
just to live with?

478
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:53,830
- No, I...
- And by the way, you're one to talk.

479
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:55,350
- You still live with your mom.
- Yeah, I...

480
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,769
- Why don't you get your own place?
- Right, that's actually what...

481
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:00,504
Wait. I just got an incredible idea!

482
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,756
Yeah? Because I just had
an incredible idea, too.

483
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:06,301
Okay, let's both say our ideas
at the same time.

484
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,845
One, two, three.

485
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:11,056
- Salty gum.
- Ice cream sandwich flavored ice cream.

486
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:12,724
Also, we should move in together.

487
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,142
Oh.

488
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,789
You know what they don't tell you
about getting sober?

489
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:21,108
The hardest part, worse than the DTs
or the looking back at everything you did

490
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,859
or the constant fear of relapse,

491
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:26,029
the hardest part is figuring out
what the hell to drink

492
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,793
when you order a meal
at a nice restaurant.

493
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:31,118
You expect me to order
the bucatini carbonara at Gusto

494
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:33,662
and then drink, what, an Arnold Palmer?

495
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:36,748
I'm not even a red wine guy, but come on!
"Here's your steak, sir.

496
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,960
Would you like an ice-cold Dr. Pepper
to go with that?" I mean...

497
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,137
Are you all right?

498
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,014
Eh... Hmm.

499
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,953
<i>I guess what I'm getting at is
I keep hearing you say,</i>

500
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,038
<i>"That's not me. I've changed."</i>

501
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,624
<i>But how can we believe
you've stopped this pattern of behavior</i>

502
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,352
<i>if you won't acknowledge
this pattern exists?</i>

503
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:24,004
<i>I don't even know what pattern
you're talking about.</i>

504
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:25,927
<i>I'll try one more time.</i>

505
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:28,800
<i>Over these last two nights,
you've drawn us an outline of a person.</i>

506
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:33,096
<i>A person who doesn't think about others,
a person who puts his own needs first.</i>

507
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,474
<i>And over and over, other people get hurt,</i>

508
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,440
<i>not necessarily because he means
to hurt them,</i>

509
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,686
<i>but because he just doesn't care.</i>

510
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:44,316
<i>This person I'm describing,
is it a different person, or is it you?</i>

511
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:45,775
Oh.

512
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,822
<i>Yeah. It's me.</i>
