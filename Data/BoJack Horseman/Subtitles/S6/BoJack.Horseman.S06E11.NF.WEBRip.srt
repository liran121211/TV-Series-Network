1
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:09,968
Watch out!

2
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:11,821
- Lift with your legs.
- I am lifting with my legs.

3
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,389
- Also lift with your arms.
- Is Horse Professor okay?

4
00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:15,472
Nothing to see here!

5
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:21,479
He just passed out from pride!
Because you kids are so talented!

6
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:24,941
You think he passed out
from embarrassment?

7
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,944
- Because the kids are not talented.
- What happened?

8
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,696
He was getting off a phone call.

9
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:32,449
I had some constructive criticism
about his play.

10
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:35,535
I tried a compliment sandwich
by starting with some praise,

11
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:36,995
but he passed out!

12
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:38,329
Just goes to show,

13
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,999
you never know how much time you have
with someone,

14
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:43,626
so you should always say
the bad stuff first.

15
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,004
BoJack! Your play sucked!

16
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,380
They found out. I didn't...

17
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:48,965
- It's not true.
- What's not true?

18
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,341
I need to... Air.

19
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:53,303
<i>♪ For he's our trusty director ♪</i>

20
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,638
No. They can't know.
I didn't even do anything.

21
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:56,556
- It's...
- Slow down.

22
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,075
Why don't you tell us what happened?

23
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:02,103
Okay, I'll tell you.
But you can't talk to anyone.

24
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,104
No reporters.

25
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:06,149
BoJack, it's okay.
No one's gonna talk to any...

26
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:09,819
Reporters? With questions about
my good friend, BoJack Horseman?

27
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,946
I'd be delighted to talk!

28
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:12,132
Oh, Baxter,
my endlessly encouraging enfianced.

29
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:15,385
I'm thrilled to report our return
from a prolonged New Mexican exodus.

30
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:18,012
True, Max and I shared lodging
to husband our expenditures,

31
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,932
and true, too, we showered together
one night when the tank broke down

32
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:23,852
and the hot water was scarce,
but other than those mild inconveniences,

33
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,287
the fact-finding mission went as fine

34
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,872
as the print at the bottom
of a contract,

35
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,857
and we're close as ever
to sewing things up.

36
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,901
So, BoJack sold the restaurant
to Joey Pogo and me,

37
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:36,197
and we relaunched it with
my fiancée Pickles as a themed eatery.

38
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,281
What is the theme?

39
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:40,326
Pickles wanted small plates,
Joey wanted lazy Susans,

40
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,621
and I wanted the theme to be my face
is on the front of the menu.

41
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,290
So, we did all three!

42
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,351
- What's the big idea?
- I'm in the middle of eating!

43
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,377
Huh? It's the perfect compromise

44
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,547
because everybody got what they wanted,
and nobody had to compromise!

45
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:56,176
- And why is it called Ele-fee-no?
- Ele-fi-no.

46
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,511
Well, if you don't know, hell if I know!

47
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,475
I know this last story
is taking its sweet time,

48
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,992
but once we can tie down
this Bo-Person Horse-fellow to Sarah Lynn

49
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,327
on the night of her death,
we'll know he procured the final blow,

50
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,687
the blow being not blow but horse,
a scoop in itself,

51
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:11,983
but I believe the larger story is...
Oh, but here I am bending your ear.

52
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:16,487
Your everlasting patience inspires me.
Do return my call. This is Paige Sinclair.

53
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:23,328
- And then I took the boat back to LA.
- That's it? How's that a story?

54
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:26,873
You did nothing illegal, and even
the not illegal thing, you didn't even do.

55
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:29,792
And yet this thing continues
to haunt me, I...

56
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,313
- Because it's not about the legality.
- Diane's right.

57
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,088
That story is super sketchy.

58
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:37,884
Is BoJack super sketchy? Yes, he is!

59
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,928
Can Horse Professor come out?

60
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:44,307
We won't go to the cast party
unless our fearless teacher comes with us!

61
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,352
Why don't you just have the party here
and he'll pop out when he's ready.

62
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:50,355
Here's some cash.
Go buy some nice cast party things.

63
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,274
This is gonna be
the best night ever!

64
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,985
Okay, okay, you're right.
I've been sketchy.

65
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,862
But there's no story here. Right?

66
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:01,407
- Unless New Mexico isn't the story.
- Uh, what?

67
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:04,371
I'm just saying, if I tried to pitch
that story, no one would publish it.

68
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:07,372
They're working on something bigger.
What did you do this time?

69
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:08,706
I haven't done anything.

70
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,376
Since I got out of rehab
I have been on my best behavior.

71
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:12,919
But before rehab...

72
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:16,047
No. They can't get me on old shit.
I'm a different person now.

73
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,275
- This could be anything.
- Or a combination of things.

74
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,175
They're gonna combo me?

75
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,552
Let's take a beat
and figure out what this story is.

76
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,721
- Todd, earmuffs.
- On it.

77
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:27,475
BoJack, tell us every bad thing
you ever did.

78
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:30,311
This is gonna be a long night.

79
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:35,358
So, what can I tell you about BoJack?
Nothing bad, though.

80
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,151
It's gonna be a short night!

81
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:41,990
- Right. I... Your chair, Miss Sinclair.
- Thanks, Mr. Banks.

82
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:45,076
And thank you, Mr. Peanutbutter,
for taking the time to quench our queries.

83
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,328
This shouldn't take more than
a half hour, max.

84
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,955
- Yes?
- No, not you Max.

85
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:51,582
- Then who Max?
- No, Max. I'm talking to Mr. Peanutbutter.

86
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,460
No, you're talking to Max.
I'm Mr. Peanutbutter.

87
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,984
Now I'm talking to Mr. Peanutbutter.

88
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,339
- Glad we're all on the same page.
- I beg your pardon.

89
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,925
Mr. Peanutbutter,
we have sitch in the kitch.

90
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,261
It's a dishwash ish.

91
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,473
- The dishwashers all quit?
- It's the small plates.

92
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:08,725
If we just had bigger plates,

93
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,911
we could get more stuff on them
and we wouldn't need so many.

94
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,687
The point of the small plates

95
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,648
is to curate a personalized
dining experience,

96
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:19,485
but because of your lazy Susans,
all the plates keep getting spun around

97
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,088
and nobody remembers who ordered what!

98
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:24,240
Oof! And then there's me,
putting my picture on the menu!

99
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,368
- What? No one cares about that.
- Yeah, the pic's not the problem.

100
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:30,830
All right. JoPo... go, why don't you start
on those dishes?

101
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,582
You got it, good buddy.

102
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,292
Oh...

103
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:38,171
Pickles, you keep manning the tables.
Those Susans aren't gonna laze themselves.

104
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,339
Sure. But...

105
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,215
Could I talk to you?

106
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,248
How much longer do we have
to keep working with that guy?

107
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,054
I thought you loved Joey Pogo!

108
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,388
I love his music!

109
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,223
He's my second favorite recording artist

110
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:52,352
after Lo-Fi Chill-Hop Beats
to study/relax to.

111
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,813
I love Lo-Fi Chill-Hop Beats
to study/relax to!

112
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,482
And I love you!

113
00:05:57,565 --> 00:06:00,693
But Joey Pogo's like your total opposite!

114
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:04,238
He's arrogant, annoyingly cheerful,
and fake-nice.

115
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:07,116
You are confident,
refreshingly optimistic,

116
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,410
and wryly sweet
with an ironic self-aware edge

117
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:12,830
that reads to some as inauthentic,
but I recognize as archly sincere!

118
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,540
Total opposites!

119
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:18,378
Okay. So, Pogo's not gonna work,
but I guess we keep trying?

120
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:21,381
I can proposition some young men on set.
That should end well.

121
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:27,261
No, I'm sorry. I want this to work.
I'll try to make it work. For us.

122
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,700
Now, if we're to finish this story,
we need to stay focused.

123
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,976
The last days of Sarah Lynn.

124
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,896
I'm telling you, the story is bigger
than just the one girl!

125
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:39,649
If we pivot our perspective
so we prove a larger pattern,

126
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,984
we can paint a clearer portrait
of a problematic person

127
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,487
for a page-one profile
that'll pave our path to a Pulitzer!

128
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,197
Paige, please! At the rate we're going,

129
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,925
we'll never file the story,
you'll remain unmarried,

130
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,094
and I'll be stuck bickering with you
until the day I die!

131
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,035
Oh, poor baby.

132
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,328
Sorry, where were we?

133
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,206
- We wanted to ask you about Sarah Lynn.
- Oh.

134
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:56,999
Before we do, let's widen our frame a tad.

135
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,126
Oh, brother.

136
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:01,629
- Would you say BoJack is a good person?
- Unequivocally, more or less.

137
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:04,006
- More-more or more-less?
- Uh...

138
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,290
Yes, but back to Sarah Lynn...

139
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:09,178
We're trying to understand if your friend
has ever exhibited certain patterns...

140
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,265
Argyle? Herringbone?
That man can pull off anything!

141
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,016
We're wasting time. Did Sarah Lynn ac...

142
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,934
Whoa!

143
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:19,605
I told you not to spin it that fast!
Lazy! Lazy!

144
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,733
I'm lazy? Aren't you supposed to be
washing dishes?

145
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,572
Hey! Where are you going?

146
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:30,825
Okay, let the cat out of the bag
so my curiosity can kill it.

147
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,743
What is going on with those two?

148
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:36,414
That's a personal matter.
I'll tell you all about it!

149
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,541
Cast party! Cast party!

150
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:41,627
We are having a cast party!

151
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,711
- Yeah!
- They didn't even buy alcohol!

152
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,798
Just a disco ball and some capes?

153
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,722
These are all the bad things
you think you did?

154
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,053
- I swear, this is all I can think of!
- None of these are big stories!

155
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,264
- We all know there are more things.
- Jesus Christ.

156
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:56,601
What's the point of working on myself
and getting sober and getting better

157
00:07:56,684 --> 00:08:00,021
if no matter what, there are people
out there just waiting to tear me down?

158
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,981
- BoJack, no.
- No, it's not fair.

159
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:04,859
If you start listing every single thing
everyone's done,

160
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,777
- then everyone's a monster.
- Nobody's...

161
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,237
Who are these reporters, anyway?

162
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,883
They're so perfect? I'll bet
there's dirt on them we could dig up!

163
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,594
- I don't think that's it...
- That'll teach those bloodthirsty leeches

164
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:16,096
what happens when they try to tear
someone down over their past

165
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,789
without even considering the possibility
that he's changed!

166
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,042
- Have you changed?
- Yes, obviously.

167
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:24,337
Because this feels like old BoJack.

168
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:28,007
I like the BoJack who's thoughtful
and directs plays

169
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:32,595
that are emotionally resonant despite
the glaring logical gaps in the plot.

170
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:36,182
It was a showcase of separate scenes!
There was no plot!

171
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:39,852
I need to go put Ruthie to bed.
Call me when new BoJack's back.

172
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,275
You didn't do any of the dishes?

173
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,945
Manual labor featuring me
is just not a fruitful collab.

174
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,322
So I just went out
and bought 500 new ones.

175
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,200
Why did Mister think I'd like you?

176
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,994
When I'm with him,
we finish each other's sentences.

177
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,621
Meanwhile, you are always...

178
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,141
Interrupting, just to say
the exact thing that you were going to?

179
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,084
- Yes! It's so...
- Annoying?

180
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,794
Thank you. That's the word.

181
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:08,089
Hey, I don't wanna be here either.
You know Joey Pogo wants to bounce.

182
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:12,134
What if we just tell Mister
we've formed an emotional bond,

183
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,594
then we can have sex,

184
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,180
and we'll never have
to see each other again!

185
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:20,893
- Why don't we just tell him we had sex?
- I can't lie to my fiancé about sex!

186
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:24,230
That's what got us into this mess
in the first place!

187
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,837
So, as soon as they go to bed
with each other,

188
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,823
we can put this whole thing to bed,
but the problem is...

189
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,616
- She loves him.
- No, the opposite.

190
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,079
No, the opposite of the opposite.
The very thing itself: she loves him.

191
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,163
Why do you say that?

192
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:44,792
You've got irises, haven't you?
And pupils and corneas?

193
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,461
You might even say you've got
a pair of eyes. Optic nerve?

194
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:48,462
Yes.

195
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,674
So how could you not see the way that
she follows him across the restaurant

196
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,218
like the puppy dog she is?
How they bicker and flirt?

197
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:57,888
Why would she fall
for a dashing cad like Joey Pogo

198
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:01,475
when she's already engaged to sweet,
dependable, predictable, safe, boring,

199
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,644
perfectly adequate Mr. Peanutbutter?

200
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:04,562
Thank you.

201
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:07,040
She only tolerates that other fellow
because she has to, for work.

202
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:09,275
Otherwise she finds him
utterly distasteful.

203
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:12,445
- Piggish even! No offense to me.
- None taken, of course.

204
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,447
No, she loves him,

205
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,074
though she'd never admit it,
even to herself.

206
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,951
And what about the boy?

207
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,915
Sure, he puts up a front
and picks a good fight,

208
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,706
but to just once hear
those stupid words "I love you"

209
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,207
tumble out of her foolish mouth

210
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,971
would drop his heart down
an elevator shaft

211
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,128
and bounce it back up to his throat.

212
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,839
- Yes?
- Yes.

213
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,967
- I'm pretty sure they hate each other.
- Uh...

214
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:38,262
I... Well, that's all very...

215
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,556
- Back to BoJack!
- And Sarah Lynn.

216
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,975
Would you say
BoJack's relationship with her

217
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,311
ever bordered on inappropriate

218
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:46,896
in the weeks leading up to her death?

219
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:50,107
No! They were closer than thieves!
They were thieves, actually.

220
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,460
They broke into my house together,

221
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,527
like great friends do,
and stole our clothes.

222
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,447
Ask Diane, she never got that jacket back!

223
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,908
But she was able to find another one
shortly thereafter

224
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,284
that looked exactly the same.

225
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,703
- Pardon me.
- Hello. Joseph?

226
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,830
Can I get an announcement drumroll,
please?

227
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,584
Never mind.

228
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,462
Joey and I have developed feelings
for each other.

229
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:12,545
Oh!

230
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:17,426
Wow, I didn't think so soon, but...
No, that's wonderful.

231
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,803
It's exactly what we wanted.

232
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,138
It is! So now we make love,

233
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:24,058
after which we can all get on
with our lives.

234
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:27,770
Great! This is good.

235
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:33,359
Look, we're not gonna
figure this out tonight.

236
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,986
Maybe I should just go
to the cast party and try to enjoy...

237
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,409
Hello?

238
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,620
Yes. Um, speaking.

239
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,416
Oh, hello, Paige Sinclair,
of the "Hollywoo Reporter."

240
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,711
Yes, I know BoJack Horseman.

241
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:55,798
Uh... What night? Did I see BoJack with...

242
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,133
Uh...

243
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:02,263
Listen, I'd love to talk more,
but, uh, I cut my finger earlier

244
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:05,516
in a bagel guillotine and I think
I require medical attention, goodbye.

245
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:06,934
Bagellotine.

246
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:09,687
It's Sarah Lynn.

247
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,606
Their story is about you and Sarah Lynn.

248
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,282
Well, uh, that was...

249
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,951
- Wow.
- Yeah.

250
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,203
Well, see ya later.

251
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:29,832
Oh.

252
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,127
Hey, I'm sorry I was kind of a dick
to you earlier.

253
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,879
The truth is, since Mr. Peanutbutter

254
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,523
has been such a good friend
and chill hang,

255
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,883
I was nervous
I would feel weird smashing his fiancée,

256
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:42,386
but once we were in it,
it was like we were two naked hearts

257
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:47,308
raw and exposed but safe in the home
we found in each other.

258
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:50,227
Yeah. Did you just come up with that?

259
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,896
No, it's from my new song,

260
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,899
"Two Naked Hearts."

261
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:59,069
- Oh. Sounds like another banger.
- Best of luck with your wedding.

262
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,793
One day I hope to have what you two have.

263
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,907
Right now, I couldn't even imagine
getting married.

264
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,830
I can't even commit
to a social media director.

265
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:05,701
Why not?

266
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,625
I'm just having a hard time finding
someone who gets my brand, you know?

267
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,164
Sexy?

268
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,209
That's exactly right, you totally get me.

269
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:16,396
So, if you think of anybody who could be
good for the job, let me know, all right?

270
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,922
- I will.
- All right.

271
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,191
I'm headed to the airport now

272
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:22,676
for another in a series of extravagant
world tours all by myself.

273
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,404
At least I'll have
the empty seat next to me

274
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,305
that I always book for extra comfort.

275
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,723
I'll be at gate six.

276
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,434
I'm just saying this information out loud
so I don't forget it.

277
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,313
Gate six. Plane boards at 10:38.

278
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:35,981
- Wait, Joey!
- Yeah?

279
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,859
Um, here's your jacket back.

280
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:40,820
Thanks, Pickles.

281
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,407
Goodbye, Joey Pogo.

282
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,035
So Sarah Lynn. That's okay.

283
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,620
- We can spin this.
- Yeah?

284
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:50,621
What are we spinning?

285
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:54,625
You went on a bender with her,
at some point you split up and she died.

286
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,919
That's the story, right?

287
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:01,215
If you want us to help you,
you need to tell us what's coming.

288
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,758
You know what I thought?

289
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,553
The first thing I thought
when I heard Sarah Lynn died?

290
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,013
Poor BoJack,
that he had to find her like that.

291
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:11,392
That's right.
Poor BoJack, that's the angle!

292
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:12,643
But then I kept thinking.

293
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:15,980
I wish I didn't,
but my stupid brain kept thinking.

294
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,815
She died of a heroin overdose, yeah?

295
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:21,902
And you had heroin, "BoJack" brand,
you kept it in your glove compartment.

296
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,547
- Diane...
- I didn't wanna think about it,

297
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:26,740
but I couldn't help but wonder.
Did you give it to her?

298
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,784
I... Uh...

299
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,286
- Yes.
- And then what?

300
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,912
- You just abandoned her?
- No, I...

301
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,790
You just left her alone,
an addict, with heroin?

302
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,542
I didn't leave her, I was with her!

303
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:40,004
I was with her the whole time!
I was with her when she died!

304
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:44,049
- Like "with her" with her?
- In the planetarium.

305
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:47,303
I left and came back
and pretended I'd found her that way.

306
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,889
I... I've never told anyone that.

307
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,557
That's really bad, BoJack.

308
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,017
Do the reporters know that?

309
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,853
I don't know how they could.
I covered my tracks.

310
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:58,105
How did you "cover your tracks"?

311
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,778
Oh. Hey. Uh, what's up?

312
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,239
We're doing
end-of-year superlatives,

313
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:11,201
and we thought it would be cool
if you came out and read some.

314
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,578
Oh, um...

315
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:15,039
Just, uh, give me a minute.

316
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:21,211
- This was supposed to be a celebration.
- We can still figure this out.

317
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,380
I'm tired of trying to figure things out.

318
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,050
Let me just have this one night.

319
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,886
It's Horse Professor!

320
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:31,138
Okay, okay, settle down, settle down.

321
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:34,433
Okay. You wanted me
to read these, right? Okay.

322
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:38,687
Um, well, for Best Old Man... Terry.

323
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,833
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- Okay. Sit down, Terry. Just sit down.

324
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:45,069
Sit down. If you start talking,
then we'll all be old!

325
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:49,239
For Best Director...
Oh, Horse Professor.

326
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,616
That's me.

327
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,910
- Speech!
- No, I... Okay, okay, okay!

328
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,787
Okay. Thank you.

329
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:59,166
I just want to say that I've loved
being here with you this year.

330
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:03,003
You've shown me the type of person
I didn't know I wanted to be.

331
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:06,715
And this semester,
I got to be that person.

332
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:08,549
Thank you.

333
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:13,180
And I just... I want you all
to appreciate this time,

334
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:16,934
and how special it is,
and how fast it'll all go away.

335
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:20,813
Please, cherish this.

336
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,441
And I have my own superlative
to announce.

337
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,277
I, um...

338
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,405
Oh. Uh, hmm...

339
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:32,658
For the Best Actor or Actress...

340
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:35,869
Oh, my God, it's an eight-way tie!

341
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,373
Okay, everyone. Enjoy your party.

342
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,135
Hi, I just gotta tell you
how much I'm loving

343
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,845
the small plates and lazy Susans.

344
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,889
I put my fork down and I never know
what I'm gonna pull back up!

345
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,100
- You've really made dinner fun again.
- Uh-huh.

346
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,936
And did you notice my picture
on the front of the menu?

347
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,564
Uh, sure. I mean that part
I could take or leave,

348
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:06,817
but the small plates and lazy Susans
work together perfectly

349
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,070
to form a completely new kind
of upscale dining experience.

350
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,822
Exactly like dim sum,

351
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,945
but with white people food,
so it's more accessible.

352
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:17,953
- Oh, well, thank you.
- Huh! Tragic, isn't it?

353
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:18,871
What is?

354
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:21,040
I just keep thinking
about Pickles and Pogo.

355
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,459
They've finally acknowledged
that they love each other,

356
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:27,254
- but she's promised to another.
- Yes. To me.

357
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,965
Oh, right!
So, you know better than anyone.

358
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,943
Someone's up to something,
I can tell you that much.

359
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,928
Mr. Peanutbutter, does your ex-wife
regularly consume bagels?

360
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,723
Hey, why don't you two mind
your own business? How about that?

361
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:40,601
As payrolled journalists,
our business is minding your business.

362
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:43,228
I'm not going to help you
with your take-down piece on BoJack.

363
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,022
- Oh, no?
- He's a good guy.

364
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:47,691
And you have no idea
how torn up he was with Sarah Lynn.

365
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:51,111
In fact, he was with her
in the planetarium when she overdosed.

366
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,781
- He actually gave her the heroin!
- Oh?

367
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,741
Yeah. He told me that once
when he was drunk,

368
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,243
and then he said,
"I've never told anybody that."

369
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:01,872
Because he's modest.
So why don't you just leave him alone?

370
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,293
Oh, Max, it's all coming together!

371
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:09,046
I could just about kiss someone
if I had someone here to kiss!

372
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:11,757
- Listen, I've been meaning to discuss...
- The story?

373
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,926
It's cooking now. Smell that sizzle?

374
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,720
We've gotta build on it.
More angles, more leads, more...

375
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,263
Whoa!

376
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,933
- Oh...
- My...

377
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:25,145
I... You know, I think our story
is about as wrapped up as a mummy.

378
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,105
What?

379
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,416
I'd better hightail it to the office
and put ink on paper.

380
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,776
But what about establishing
a larger pattern of behavior?

381
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,570
We still haven't heard back
from the New Mexico girl

382
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,156
or our contact
at the rehabilitation clinic.

383
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,784
Don't you think we ought
to keep working together?

384
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:41,912
No, I think I ought to get married.
You were right all along, Banks, my boy.

385
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:44,164
The story is Sarah Lynn. It always was.

386
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,499
Taxi!

387
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,670
Wait! Paige! I, uh...

388
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,173
- I love you!
- Oh, Max. Of course you do.

389
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:56,135
Everybody does. I'm Paige Sinclair!

390
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:07,104
So, what happens?
When the story comes out, what do I do?

391
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:11,441
A statement about how sorry you are
about certain parts of the story

392
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,902
but other parts of the story
just aren't true.

393
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:14,862
No, you...

394
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:18,532
Then in everyone's head
you've apologized for the really bad stuff

395
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:21,160
without legally implicating yourself.

396
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,744
- Does that work?
- All the time.

397
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,372
No, it doesn't.
Why are you telling him to lie?

398
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:29,293
Because this is good.
This BoJack here is good.

399
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,754
This is working, but it's so precarious.

400
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,590
Well, I'm not gonna lose
my job here, right?

401
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,301
The Sarah Lynn stuff,
that has nothing to do with this.

402
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:38,218
- Right.
- No.

403
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:41,221
You're about to get pushed out of a plane,
and the two of you are talking

404
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:44,224
like you're trying to brainstorm ways
to get back on the plane.

405
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,559
That's not gonna happen.

406
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:48,896
You can try to find a parachute
or you can dive headfirst into the earth,

407
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,898
but the plane is gone.

408
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:54,193
You're seeing things in absolutes.
We can wriggle out of this.

409
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:56,445
- Who's "we"?
- Diane, I'm asking you for help.

410
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,113
This job is my lifeline.

411
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:02,117
I think you should do the hard thing
and be honest.

412
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,828
About everything. Things will get worse
before they get better,

413
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:08,790
but you won't spend the rest of your life
waiting for the other shoe to drop.

414
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,375
Yeah.

415
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,045
BoJack, just think...

416
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,342
Wesleyan University Theater Department.

417
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,219
<i>Paige Sinclair,
"Hollywoo Reporter."</i>

418
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,502
<i>Is this a Mr. BoJack Horseman?</i>

419
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,388
- Y-yes.
- <i>Fabulous.</i>

420
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,932
<i>We're running a story Thursday next</i>

421
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:27,575
<i>about your relationship with Sarah Lynn
leading up to her death.</i>

422
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,996
<i>I wanted to give you a chance
to respond to these allegations.</i>

423
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,439
<i>I presume you will deny them,
as is customary,</i>

424
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:36,443
<i>but this is me doing my due diligence
and reaching out for comment, understood?</i>

425
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:37,611
Uh, yeah.

426
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:41,281
<i>Now, did you supply Sarah Lynn
with the drugs found on her person?</i>

427
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:42,741
No.

428
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:46,495
<i>All right. And did you use heroin
with Sarah Lynn during those last weeks?</i>

429
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:47,871
- No.
<i>- Uh-huh.</i>

430
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,957
<i>Were you with her when she died?</i>

431
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,833
Um... No.

432
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,461
<i>And did you lie to the police
about any of these things?</i>

433
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:55,544
No.

434
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:59,174
<i>Thank you for your time.</i>

435
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,634
What happened to being honest?

436
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:03,428
I didn't think it would happen so fast.
Did she say next Thursday?

437
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:06,223
That gives us a week to plan.
We can minimize damage.

438
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:08,141
"We" are not doing anything.

439
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,560
- Diane, please.
- I can't be a part of this.

440
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,354
I have a book to write.

441
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,773
Oh, my God!

442
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:17,943
They're all making out out here!
Go to your dorms!

443
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,903
You have rooms!

444
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:27,452
Well, we did it.
And by "it," I mean <i>doing it.</i>

445
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,371
Oh-ho! Fantastic.

446
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:33,375
So, now we're even,
and everything can go back to normal.

447
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,687
I can't wait. First step:
let's set a date for the wedding.

448
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,379
Joey has a job opening on his tour

449
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:40,590
that I think could be
a real opportunity for me.

450
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:41,717
Oh.

451
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:47,014
Only thing is, I'd have to go tonight,
and I might be gone for a while.

452
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:50,600
- Oh.
- Oh, Mister, I'm so confused!

453
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:54,313
I feel like my brain is on a lazy Susan,
just spinning in all directions.

454
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,898
And I know I should be ready
to commit to a main course,

455
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,151
but right now I'm just so excited

456
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:01,862
about all the different small plates
out there, you know?

457
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:04,906
It sounds like maybe this is a bad time
to have my face printed

458
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,908
on the cover of your metaphorical menu.

459
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:10,370
What? Oh, yeah.
I forgot about that part of it.

460
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,331
Go on Joey's tour. Have a good time.

461
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:15,292
And we'll plan the wedding...
when I get back?

462
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,836
Sure, Pickles... when you get back.

463
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:20,213
- Sounds like a good compromise.
- Yeah?

464
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,965
Yeah. The best.

465
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:25,510
Everyone gets what they want
and no one had to compromise.

466
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,305
Oh, my God, I gotta go!

467
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:30,515
- Okay, I love you!
- Hey.

468
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:34,770
Thank you, for everything.

469
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:40,942
Hey! Sad Dog!

470
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,073
- I think the party's over.
- Yeah.

471
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,407
What do you got?

472
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,494
"My relationship with Sarah Lynn
was complicated,

473
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:53,372
as relationships between addicts
often are.

474
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:57,209
However, certain aspects of the story
are inaccurate or exaggerated.

475
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,544
This story has started
an important conversation

476
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:03,173
and I look forward to continuing to work
on my own progress..."

477
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:06,676
There's... There's no way
to not sound like bullshit.

478
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:08,887
Yeah, well...

479
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,348
This place was supposed to be
a fresh start for me.

480
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:13,475
Rehab was supposed to be a fresh start.

481
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:16,603
But no matter how many starts I get,
there's always the same ending.

482
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:19,398
Everything falls apart and I end up alone.

483
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:23,151
- I'm still here, BoJack.
- Why?

484
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:26,113
I don't know. I'm a fool, I guess.

485
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,281
And you were my first client,

486
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:32,077
and one time you were drunk
and you smiled at me and I said, "What?"

487
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:36,706
And you said, "I just like being in a room
with you. You make rooms good."

488
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,624
You still do.

489
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:43,046
I have loved you for 25 years,
and I never loved anyone better.

490
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,508
That kind of love, you only get it
when you're young and stupid.

491
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:47,926
I'm not gonna get it again.

492
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:51,388
And when I tell my daughter the story
of the great love of my life,

493
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,849
I want it to have a happy ending.

494
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,768
Is it possible you letting me go
is the happy ending?

495
00:23:56,852 --> 00:24:00,272
I've gone with you this far.
In for a penny, in for a pound, right?

496
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:01,731
Sunk cost and all that?

497
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,651
Yeah, sunk cost.

498
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,698
The story's coming out Thursday.

499
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:14,286
I don't think that we can get around this,
or over this, or try to get under it.

500
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,746
- Diane is right. We need to go through it.
- BoJack...

501
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,665
I need to take responsibility.

502
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:19,915
I want to.

503
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,669
So you can tell your daughter
you helped me do the right thing.

504
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:27,674
- I'll call you tomorrow with a plan.
- I'm looking forward to it.

505
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,720
- You sure?
- I mean, no.
