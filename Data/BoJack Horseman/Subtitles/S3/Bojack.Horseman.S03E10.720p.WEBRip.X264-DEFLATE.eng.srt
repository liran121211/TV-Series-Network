00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:15,224
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

2
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:18,227
<i>to announce</i>
<i>this year's Oscar nominees...</i>

3
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:20,896
<i>Mr. Peanutbutter!</i>

4
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:28,320
<i>Mr. Peanutbutter!</i>

5
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:32,573
<i>Mr. Peanutbutter?</i>

6
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:37,704
Hello! Here I am, Mr. Peanutbutter.

7
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:39,622
That's my name and I am here.

8
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:43,085
Okay, the nominees.
Nominees for Oscar.

9
00:00:43,167 --> 00:00:44,710
Who are the nominees?

10
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:48,090
Well, as I used to say
on <i>Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities:</i>

11
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:51,218
<i>What Do They Know?</i>
<i>Do They Know Things? Let's Find Out,</i>

12
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,802
let's find out.

13
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,554
For Best Actor, the nominees are:

14
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:57,890
Jurj Clooners
for <i>The Nazi Who Played Yahtzee.</i>

15
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:00,060
Bread Poot for <i>City of AIDS.</i>

16
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,978
Colin Firth for <i>First Things Firth:</i>

17
00:01:02,061 --> 00:01:03,271
<i>The Colin Firth Story.</i>

18
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:06,400
Michael Fassbender for...
I want to say <i>Bill Gates?</i>

19
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:09,444
And BoJack Horseman for <i>Secretariat.</i>

20
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:13,239
Whoa.

21
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:16,242
BoJack, you just got nominated
for an Oscar.

22
00:01:16,325 --> 00:01:18,662
You're an Oscar nominee.
How do you feel?

23
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,121
I feel...

24
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,456
I-I feel...

25
00:01:22,748 --> 00:01:24,042
I feel...

26
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,253
the same.

27
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:35,344
<i>♪♪</i>

28
00:02:20,931 --> 00:02:23,977
It happened again. Why do I keep
thinking things will make me happy?

29
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:26,771
-What is wrong with me?
-BoJack, don't do this.

30
00:02:26,854 --> 00:02:31,318
-Don't fetishize your own sadness.
-Uh... Oh, God, I'm drowning.

31
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:34,487
-I feel like I'm drowning.
-BoJack, listen.

32
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:38,574
When I was 17,
I snuck out to a fraternity party.

33
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,703
<i>The roads were icy</i>
<i>and I swerved into the lake.</i>

34
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,625
<i>I came to underwater.</i>

35
00:02:46,707 --> 00:02:50,795
<i>It was dark and cold,</i>
<i>and I didn't even know which way was up.</i>

36
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:54,341
<i>I thought for sure I was going to drown.</i>

37
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,510
<i>And then... I noticed...</i>

38
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:01,931
<i>when I opened my mouth,</i>
<i>the air bubbles floated up,</i>

39
00:03:02,014 --> 00:03:04,600
<i>and that's how I knew</i>
<i>which way to swim.</i>

40
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:07,729
That is a terrifying story.

41
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:11,566
BoJack, when you find yourself lost
and disoriented and underwater

42
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,693
and you don't know which way is up,

43
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:15,694
it's important to breathe.

44
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:19,199
I don't deserve this.
I'm not a best actor.

45
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,659
Awards aren't about who's best, BoJack.

46
00:03:21,742 --> 00:03:23,662
That's literally the only thing
they're about.

47
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,664
No. All this means is that
you're one of the special people.

48
00:03:26,747 --> 00:03:30,836
I saw it the first time I met you.
You must have known it all your life.

49
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,462
And all your life, people told you
that you were wrong,

50
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:37,091
that you weren't special,
that you were just like everybody else.

51
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:42,805
But now, the special people are saying,
"You were right, BoJack. You were right."

52
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:46,016
I was right.
I am one of the special people.

53
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,353
-Yes.
-What are we doing just sitting here?

54
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:49,937
I just got nominated for an Oscar.

55
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:55,485
We gotta party like it's 1982,
the year Prince released <i>1999.</i>

56
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:04,953
Whoo-hoo!

57
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:06,747
<i>♪ Go, go, go... ♪</i>

58
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:21,011
BoJack, your complimentary Rolex is here.

59
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:25,055
BoJack, giant chocolate Oscar's here.

60
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:28,976
Famous DJ David Gu-etta is at the door.

61
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,773
Free Tesla's here, Boj. They want to know
if they can park it in your driveway.

62
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:33,774
No.

63
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:37,735
Tell them I want my free Tesla parked
in my goddamn living room. I'm BoJack!

64
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:49,122
Yeah, now we're doing it!
Look at us partying.

65
00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:55,170
BoJack, you got another delivery.
Someone sent a... nerd?

66
00:04:55,252 --> 00:04:56,588
Hi.

67
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,509
You get a load
of this chili cheese fountain?

68
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:05,262
-Grab a handful of beans and go to town.
-Hey, this is all really something.

69
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,557
But I actually just came
because I heard about the nomination

70
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:08,975
and I wanted to make sure you're okay.

71
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,976
That's a funny way
of saying congratulations.

72
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,980
But not funny "ha-ha",
more like funny <i>Doonesbury.</i>

73
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:16,817
I know how this kind of thing
can sometimes send you spinning.

74
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:19,903
"Oh, God, why doesn't this make me happy?
Will anything make me happy?

75
00:05:19,985 --> 00:05:21,822
I'm an empty husk." That kind of thing.

76
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,990
Well, thank you for that,
but I'm actually doing great.

77
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:27,369
I direct your attention to
the aforementioned chili cheese fountain!

78
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:32,456
It's too bad I'm not managing
your social campaign anymore,

79
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,625
because this party would make
a great Snapchat story.

80
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,086
You are not gonna make me guilty
about leaving Princess Carolyn.

81
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,297
I'm not here to make you feel guilty.
Like I said--

82
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,091
Honestly, I don't even know
what you're doing over there.

83
00:05:41,173 --> 00:05:43,927
-Tweeting for celebrities?
-Well, actually, I don't--

84
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:46,303
When I met you, you were
so cool and interesting--

85
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:47,514
Uh, I was never cool.

86
00:05:47,596 --> 00:05:49,848
You used to actually care about shit.
What happened?

87
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:52,894
I don't know, BoJack.
Maybe caring about shit got old.

88
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:56,605
Maybe I'm tired of everyone yelling at me
and sending death threats to my house,

89
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,733
and all my friends thinking I'm annoying,
and getting in fights with my husband,

90
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:02,946
and seeing little refugee boys
die in hospital bombings.

91
00:06:03,028 --> 00:06:06,031
It's exhausting and I can't do it.
If that makes me a bad person,

92
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:08,367
then I'm sorry that I'm not
the "cool, interesting girl."

93
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:11,620
I never said you were a bad person.
I just said it's not you.

94
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:12,997
And you know it's not you.

95
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,625
Oh, and this party is you?
Who are all these people?

96
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,418
-These are my friends.
-Name one of them.

97
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:20,170
-Tes-ley.
-You're just looking at the Tesla.

98
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:22,464
I don't know why it's so hard for you
to believe that I could be happy.

99
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,882
I'm not like you, okay?

100
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:28,887
-I don't fetishize my own sadness.
-I don't fetishize my own sadness.

101
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,851
-Sure.
-You don't know anything about me.

102
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:36,353
Hey!

103
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,480
I know that you can tweet for a living

104
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,608
in a house in Beverly Hills
that your husband bought,

105
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:43,653
or you can think you're better
than everyone, but you can't do both.

106
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:47,740
-I don't think I'm better than everyone.
-And again, I say, sure.

107
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:48,824
You know what's gonna happen?

108
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,827
You're gonna win that Oscar,
and you're gonna go up on that stage

109
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,872
and give your little speech,
and then you're gonna go home.

110
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,542
And you're gonna be so miserable,
you'll want to kill yourself.

111
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,877
And you're gonna have nobody left
to stop you.

112
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,589
Hey, it's BoJack!

113
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:04,923
BoJack! BoJack!

114
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:07,677
No one's gonna be there
when I kill myself?

115
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,887
Listen to that chanting, Diane.

116
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,680
The chanting don't lie.

117
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:15,018
There's going to be plenty
of people around when I kill myself.

118
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,185
BoJack!

119
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,064
Tell your readers
that BoJack was sleeping.

120
00:07:19,146 --> 00:07:21,774
He didn't even know
they were announced today.

121
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,194
Okay. Goodbye, Heather.

122
00:07:24,276 --> 00:07:27,112
-Hey, Ana, can I ask you something?
-Of course, darling.

123
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:30,033
-So, if I win the Oscar--
-"When" you win the Oscar.

124
00:07:30,115 --> 00:07:32,911
Right. But after that,
what's gonna happen to us?

125
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,620
-What do you mean?
-What we have.

126
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,872
It's more than
just an Oscar campaign, right?

127
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,040
-I need to go.
-What?

128
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,209
There's work to be done.

129
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,420
We got the nomination,
but now, the real battle begins.

130
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:45,715
Enjoy your party.
Stop worrying about the future.

131
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,449
Come on, buddy! Come on!

132
00:08:15,577 --> 00:08:17,579
-Mr. Peanutbutter!
-Thank God you're okay.

133
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,124
Better than okay. I'm wonderful.

134
00:08:19,206 --> 00:08:21,543
Thanks to you, you wonderful man.

135
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:24,295
When you said my name this morning,
you changed my life.

136
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,255
-About that--
-Hey, did you see Erica here?

137
00:08:26,338 --> 00:08:28,341
She was looking for you earlier,
with her good eye.

138
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,300
Her other eye was looking to the stars.

139
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:33,429
-BoJack, I need to talk to you.
-Yeah? What's going on, buddy?

140
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,850
Well, I've got good news
and I've got bad news.

141
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:49,111
Raven on a wire.
A gloomy portent, precariously perched.

142
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:53,490
And, as the sun sets,
so does it spread its deathly shadow

143
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:57,912
across the just and unjust
of the outdoor seating area

144
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:00,206
of the California Pizza Kitchen.

145
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:03,250
Mm-hmm! And what better way
to view such disquieting omens

146
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,961
than through these gorgeous
floor-to-ceiling windows?

147
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:10,508
Yeah. Wow! They really make
regular windows look like shit.

148
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:13,720
I can't look out the window
while lying on the floor?

149
00:09:13,802 --> 00:09:17,514
-No, thank you, regular window!
-Tell me a little about your company.

150
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:20,059
Well, it started as a safe space
for women.

151
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:20,976
Ooh!

152
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:24,898
Then, it became a safe space
for women and men.

153
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:25,856
Oh!

154
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,860
Now, it's more
of a safe-ish space for women...

155
00:09:28,942 --> 00:09:29,778
Mm-hmm.

156
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,780
...and a really safe space
for men to look at women...

157
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:33,697
I hear you.

158
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:35,658
...while also being driven around by them.

159
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:39,162
-Wow! Something for everyone.
-Demand is skyrocketing.

160
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,163
That's why we need a bigger office space.

161
00:09:41,246 --> 00:09:42,831
You come to work, clock in,

162
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,292
you put sugar in your coffee,

163
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,586
and watch it slowly disappear
into nothingness.

164
00:09:47,669 --> 00:09:50,673
But the sugar doesn't know why.
Sugar didn't ask to be born.

165
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:51,591
Is he okay?

166
00:09:51,673 --> 00:09:53,884
He recently found out
that his brother's sick.

167
00:09:53,967 --> 00:09:56,513
Oh. I'm so sorry,
but you know what else is sick?

168
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,681
-These hardwood floors.
-Ooh!

169
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,975
Did you hear that, Mr. Peanutbutter?

170
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,817
Losing BoJack was a blow.
There's no way to sugarcoat it,

171
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,610
even if I were generally good
at sugarcoating things, which I'm not.

172
00:10:11,693 --> 00:10:15,072
You know, I wish
cats really did have nine lives.

173
00:10:15,155 --> 00:10:17,951
It would make me feel better
about how much I'm screwing up this one.

174
00:10:18,033 --> 00:10:19,284
You're not screwing up your life.

175
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:22,330
Sometimes I feel like,
if I could start everything over,

176
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:25,582
knowing what I know now,
I'd do it all right this time.

177
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,501
But other times I think...

178
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:28,961
No, I wouldn't.

179
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,258
As you all know, things have been rough,

180
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,927
and, unfortunately,
we have to scale back our staff.

181
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:38,679
-Mainly, you.
-Are you firing me?

182
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,557
In a sense, yes.

183
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:42,975
But, in another sense,
I'm promoting you

184
00:10:43,058 --> 00:10:45,562
to a position of finding a job
somewhere else.

185
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:49,941
Yeah. I don't think I ever thanked you
for giving me this job in the first place.

186
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,985
It was an honor to work with you.

187
00:10:52,067 --> 00:10:55,738
You were the worst social media
coordinator this company ever had.

188
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,827
Are you sure you need surgery?
Can't you get a second opinion?

189
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:05,038
Second opinion? You know
there's only one doctor on the Peninsula.

190
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,417
I could ask him twice
if it'd make you feel better.

191
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,418
Nothing could make me
feel better right now.

192
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:12,462
Not even an amazing career opportunity.
Hold on, I'm getting another call.

193
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:15,758
I've got to take this. It could be
an amazing career opportunity. Hello?

194
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,385
Mr. Peanutbutter, this is Shep Von Trapp,

195
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,803
awards show producer,

196
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:21,639
with a career opportunity

197
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:25,225
that is... good.

198
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,186
This isn't a great time, Shep.
Could you call back?

199
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,687
Absolutely... not.

200
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:32,817
The Oscar nomination announcement
is in seven days and we don't have a host.

201
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,278
Sadly, Jimmy Fallon just broke his face.

202
00:11:36,111 --> 00:11:37,947
What? Halloween in January?

203
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,073
What a crazy concept! I can't believe it!

204
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,159
I mean, what is this?
Barry Gibb would be like...

205
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,120
<i>♪ I'm going in! ♪</i>

206
00:11:44,202 --> 00:11:46,956
No. First, I gotta get a selfie
with this thing.

207
00:11:47,831 --> 00:11:49,459
I'm Jimmy Fallon--

208
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,544
<i>Und</i> you are our first choice

209
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,298
after our first "first choice"
got hit by a bus.

210
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,176
You're our second "first choice."
What do you say?

211
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:01,888
Ooh, a job like that? You want
a fully present presenter to present.

212
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,681
And I don't know
if I've got the pep in my step

213
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,892
to take that show
where it needs to go, you know?

214
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,393
I've got a real pepless step, Shep.

215
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:10,062
Okay, well, let me know,
because if you don't want to do it,

216
00:12:10,145 --> 00:12:12,899
we'll probably just post the list
of nominees online or something.

217
00:12:12,981 --> 00:12:14,192
It's really not that big of a deal.

218
00:12:14,274 --> 00:12:16,985
Hey, sorry about that.
Just got a call from the Oscars.

219
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:21,157
-They want me to host--
-They want you to host the Oscars?

220
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,575
Nomination announcement.

221
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:24,201
But I don't think
I have it in me right now.

222
00:12:24,284 --> 00:12:26,412
Are you kidding?
You gotta take that gig.

223
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,413
-Really?
-Mr. Peanutbutter...

224
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,917
what did Nana Peanutbutter always say?

225
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,293
"Always take every opportunity
that comes your way

226
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,922
because opportunities
are like sneezes from God,

227
00:12:36,004 --> 00:12:38,508
and when God sneezes,
you can't say 'God bless you' to God,

228
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,342
so instead you have
to take the opportunity.

229
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,470
I'm cold. Will you pass me that blanket?"

230
00:12:42,552 --> 00:12:44,972
Boy, that old gal had something
for everything, didn't she?

231
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:46,599
I know you're worried about me,

232
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:49,686
but sitting around the house worrying
isn't going to help anyone.

233
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,105
Okay, but you'll call me
when you get out of the surgery, right?

234
00:12:52,187 --> 00:12:53,940
I'm not gonna let my phone leave my sight.

235
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:57,275
Of course. And now,
I've got something new to live for.

236
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,697
My little brother, telling the whole world
who got an Oscar!

237
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,157
Nomination.

238
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:09,038
We are minutes away.
Shep, release the envelope.

239
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,206
Copy that. Releasing the envelope.

240
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:13,710
It's go time.

241
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,129
It's go time.

242
00:13:17,212 --> 00:13:21,134
-Are you ready, Brother Pricewater?
-Of course, Brother Housecoopers.

243
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:31,019
Mr. Peanutbutter,
we'd like to invite you to the stage.

244
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:33,687
It's here! The golden envelope.

245
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,566
-Hmm...
-<i>Herr</i> Peanutbutter?

246
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,192
Okay. Oh, my phone.
What should I do with it, Todd?

247
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:40,445
-Maybe you should hold it.
-Uh-huh.

248
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,653
-No, I'll take it with me.
-All right.

249
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,030
-No, you hold it.
-Sure thing, yeah.

250
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:44,948
-No, put it in my jacket pocket.
-Right here. Okay.

251
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:47,951
Oh, no, it's a fake pocket.
Tricked again!

252
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,620
Todd, it's ringing. This is it.

253
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:50,830
Oh, no, my phone!

254
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,624
Oh, no, I kicked it, right through
that doorway into the hallway!

255
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:56,586
Now, other people are kicking it
and it's sliding across the floor!

256
00:13:56,668 --> 00:13:59,004
-Okay, this is getting absurd.
-Let's get that phone!

257
00:13:59,087 --> 00:14:02,633

-Mr. Peanutbutter.

274
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:47,552
I just, um... I wanted to give you
a chance to say goodbye...

275
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:49,971
-Oh, no.
-...to my twisted spleen.

276
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,975
Because it was successfully removed
from my body!

277
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,726
Oh, my God, that's incredible!

278
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:58,063
Now, get out there
and announce those Oscars!

279
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,149
Nominations. You got it, buddy.

280
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,567
Okay. Now, where's the... the...

281
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:05,404
Uh-oh. Could've sworn it was right here.

282
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,697
Oh!

283
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,908
Oh! There you are.
You need to get on stage.

284
00:15:09,991 --> 00:15:13,870
Yes, just as soon as you give me that
backup envelope, please and <i>por favor.</i>

285
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:16,374
What back-up envelope?
There is no back-up envelope.

286
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,251
That was a test and you passed.

287
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,878
<i>Wunderbar.</i>
Now, let's get you out there.

288
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:25,216
Yes, gotta get out there, on to the stage,
to announce the nominations.

289
00:15:25,298 --> 00:15:28,052
Just as soon as I--
Oh, my God, is that Bradley Cooper?

290
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,513
Bradley Cooper?
We love him for some reason.

291
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,181
-Where?
-Let's go, Todd.

292
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,183
-Oh, God, what do we do?
-It's okay.

293
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,562
We just need to come up
with all the nominees ourselves.

294
00:15:37,644 --> 00:15:39,605
But I haven't even seen all the movies.

295
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,357
Todd, nobody has.
That's not how they give out awards.

296
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,734
-But--
-Time for talk is over.

297
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:44,902
Now's the time for action.

298
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:47,989
And by "action," I mean
talking about these 24 categories

299
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,948
until we've settled on a list of nominees.

300
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,076
You need to tell me right now,
are you in or out?

301
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,619
Well, when you put it that way,

302
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:56,913
I guess you can call me
high-waisted denim,

303
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:59,834
because, right now, I am very in.

304
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:00,835
Let's do this.

305
00:16:02,043 --> 00:16:03,296
What did you think of Frieda Pinto?

306
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,755
Are you kidding me?
Anybody could do what she did.

307
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,719
"Don't take my baby.
I'll give you all my Bitcoins!"

308
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,386
Wow. That is good.

309
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:14,347
Okay, for Best Picture,
what about <i>Avatar?</i>

310
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:17,851
-That was a good movie.
-True, but did that come out this year?

311
00:16:17,934 --> 00:16:20,687
-I feel like I just saw it.
-Well, there's no way to know for sure.

312
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:21,980
Let's just throw it on the list.

313
00:16:22,063 --> 00:16:25,485
Ooh, do we have Daniel Day-Lewis
down for anything? He's always there.

314
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:26,903
Good catch! I'll add him.

315
00:16:26,985 --> 00:16:28,028
Daniel Day-Lewis.

316
00:16:28,111 --> 00:16:32,491
Okay. We need one more nominee
for Best Actor. Oh, what about BoJack?

317
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:35,244
His performance in <i>Secretariat</i>
was as thoughtful and self-aware

318
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,328
as we've ever seen him.

319
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,413
-Besides, he's our friend.
-Is he?

320
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:42,000
Whoa! I am surprised to hear
you say that, Todd Chavez.

321
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,544
-Let's dig into that. We have time.
-I don't think we do.

322
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:46,588
You're supposed to be
announcing these, like, now.

323
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,091
There is always time
to talk about our feelings.

324
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,177
As my Nana Peanutbutter used to say,

325
00:16:51,259 --> 00:16:53,053
"There's always time
to talk about feelings,

326
00:16:53,136 --> 00:16:55,556
because feelings
are the ceilings of our hearts,

327
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:58,392
and a leaky feeling ceiling
leads to a flood of blood.

328
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,519
And I'm cold.
Will you pass me that blanket?"

329
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:04,898
Well, I guess I'm just tired
of BoJack walking all over everybody

330
00:17:04,981 --> 00:17:07,652
and still getting everything he wants.

331
00:17:07,734 --> 00:17:09,987
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. I think
the important thing to remember here

332
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,573
is that BoJack is a damaged individual,

333
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:16,911
struggling against a sea of demons,
many self-created, but still all too real.

334
00:17:16,993 --> 00:17:19,747
Getting this nomination
from the two friends he loves the most--

335
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:22,500
you and also me--
would really mean a lot to him.

336
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,085
Okay.

337
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:26,336
But did you really think
he was that good in the movie?

338
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,048
Oh, I haven't seen it. It seemed long.

339
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:33,469
And the final nominee
for Best Picture is <i>Avatar.</i>

340
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:36,681
Well, those are all the nominations.
I will not be taking any questions.

341
00:17:36,763 --> 00:17:38,182
Goodbye. I must go.

342
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,814
I gotta say, we picked
some top-notch noms.

343
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:45,730
You know it!

344
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,900
Boy, was I glad when we got
out of that theater, though.

345
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,902
I know. So many questions.

346
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:52,613
"Oh, what the hell happened?

347
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:57,785
Why were you reading off that napkin?
Why are you guys running?"

348
00:17:57,867 --> 00:18:00,078
They have their nominees.
What more could they want?

349
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,999
You know what's crazy?
We saved the day today,

350
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,750
and no one will ever even know.

351
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,878
Hey, we'll know.

352
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,924
Mr. Peanutbutter, we know what you did.

353
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:13,925
Oh, boy.

354
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:18,346
So, the good news is,
my brother's surgery was a success.

355
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,724
And the bad news is,
you're not nominated for an Oscar.

356
00:18:20,807 --> 00:18:22,434
And the other good news is...

357
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,144
...that each breath is a gift

358
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,980
and it is a joy to live.

359
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,816
-What?
-We are so lucky we get to be alive.

360
00:18:28,898 --> 00:18:30,942
-No, before that.
-Oh, I didn't tell you.

361
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:33,903
-My brother's been sick.
-No, I don't care about your brother.

362
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:35,072
First of all, manners.

363
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:38,284
Second of all, I think if you met him,
you'd actually really hit it off.

364
00:18:38,366 --> 00:18:41,037
Imagine me but with less
"in your face" cool guy attitude.

365
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,954
Did you say I'm not nominated
for an Oscar?

366
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,039
Oh...

367
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,790
A lot of people are mighty steamed,

368
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,336
but I feel like what everyone's
overlooking here is,

369
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,587
I got most of the categories dead-on.

370
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,340
That's pretty amazing, and I am not
getting enough credit for that.

371
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:55,843
Did you know
that <i>Avatar </i>came out in 2009?

372
00:18:55,925 --> 00:18:58,011
-I'm not nominated for an Oscar.
-No.

373
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,847
But you know what they say.
"It's an honor just to be nominated."

374
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:01,932
Oh, wait.

375
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:04,309
So, I'm just like everybody else.

376
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:07,313
I know you're upset, but whatever you do,
please don't get mad at Todd.

377
00:19:07,395 --> 00:19:10,732
-Why would I get mad at Todd?
-Exactly. This is totally my fault.

378
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,609
-He didn't even want to nominate you.
-What?

379
00:19:12,692 --> 00:19:13,818
With the gift of hindsight,

380
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:16,529
I see now how that might have
made you even more upset.

381
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:19,450
But I realized something today,
when my brother called from the hospital,

382
00:19:19,532 --> 00:19:21,786
and I think it's gonna
make you feel a lot better.

383
00:19:21,868 --> 00:19:25,163
-What? What is it?
-None of this matters.

384
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,124
Okay, I'll see you later, buddy.

385
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,714
As a partner in the company,

386
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:37,175
I am prepared to forgo my salary
for the next three months,

387
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,636
but even then, we're going
to need some sort of miracle.

388
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,472
What are we doing?
What was the point of any of this?

389
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,101
I wasted everyone's time for six months.

390
00:19:45,183 --> 00:19:48,061
Soon, I'll get some offer
from one of the big five agencies

391
00:19:48,144 --> 00:19:49,646
that I can't say no to,

392
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,106
and I'll go back to being another cog

393
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,818
in the giant Play-Doh spaghetti maker
that is this industry.

394
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,320
-Is that the best I can hope for?
-Not necessarily.

395
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,824
Although, there is one thing
I should probably mention.

396
00:19:59,906 --> 00:20:01,200
What is it, Judah?

397
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:06,204
Maybe this is an opportunity
to live one of your other eight lives.

398
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:09,375
Yeah, maybe.

399
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,919
It's been a pleasure
working with you, Judah.

400
00:20:12,001 --> 00:20:14,212
I found it to be
an above average experience.

401
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,798
Please forgive me for getting emotional.

402
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:25,266
Rye, wheat, or sourdough?

403
00:20:25,348 --> 00:20:27,268
Can I get it on stale?

404
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:30,730
And then, he said,
I fetishize my own sadness.

405
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:33,481
What did you think was
gonna happen? Why did you go there?

406
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:34,733
I don't know.

407
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,652
-Did you ask for water?
-No.

408
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,113
They're not supposed to give us water
unless we ask.

409
00:20:39,195 --> 00:20:42,240
-Don't they know there's a drought?
-You want to send the water back?

410
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,160
No, I want the water. I just...

411
00:20:44,242 --> 00:20:46,703
I went to BoJack's house
to congratulate him.

412
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,163
I'm not trying to pick fights.

413
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,583
Well, you don't have to see him at all
if you don't want to.

414
00:20:50,665 --> 00:20:52,334
It's not like you work for him anymore.

415
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:55,546
-Is he right? Am I a bad person?
-Who cares what he thinks?

416
00:20:55,628 --> 00:20:58,507
Why do you have
this weird fixation with him?

417
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:02,260
I do not have a fixation, Roxy.
I worry about him.

418
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,511
Okay. And last year?

419
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,972
When you came back from Cordovia
and needed a place to crash?

420
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,642
Oh, you could have stayed with me,
or any of your other friends,

421
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:10,185
but you went right to his house.

422
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,730
Did you ever ask yourself why?

423
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,357
They're filling everyone's glasses.
This is insane.

424
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,693
Oh, my God. What do you care?

425
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,362
Hey, excuse me? Excuse me?

426
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,490
Do you know you're breaking the law
by giving everybody water?

427
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:24,741
It's okay. I want the water.

428
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,912
Yeah, we all want water.
That's not the point.

429
00:21:27,994 --> 00:21:30,955
In the state of California,
it is illegal for a restaurant

430
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,792
to serve people water
before they ask for it.

431
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:36,921
There is a drought.

432
00:21:37,003 --> 00:21:38,713
Sit down! We're thirsty!

433
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,759
You know,
this is what's wrong with society.

434
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:42,718
Diane...

435
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,762
Nobody thinks about the world
outside themselves.

436
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:50,518
So, how you doing?
You still working at that place?

437
00:21:53,561 --> 00:21:56,065
-<i>Hello?</i>
-Hi, Ralph. It's Princess Carolyn.

438
00:21:56,147 --> 00:21:59,234
<i>Oh, my God, Princess Carolyn,</i>
<i>I never thought I'd hear from you again.</i>

439
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:00,986
I might have some free time coming up.

440
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:03,154
I was wondering
if you might want to get a drink.

441
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:07,409
<i>Okay. So, the night I met you after I said</i>
<i>goodbye, the craziest thing happened.</i>

442
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:08,493
Okay?

443
00:22:08,576 --> 00:22:10,578
<i>I was walking back to my car,</i>
<i>when all of a sudden,</i>

444
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,288
<i>- this woman...</i>
<i>- Oh.</i>

445
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:14,250
<i>...tripped on a cobblestone,</i>
<i>twisted her ankle,</i>

446
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,167
<i>- and tumbled into my arms.</i>
<i>- What?</i>

447
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:19,171
<i>Turns out, she was a ballerina,</i>
<i>and she didn't speak a word of English.</i>

448
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,923
<i>So, I rushed her to the hospital,</i>
<i>and long story short, we eloped.</i>

449
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,174
- <i>Oh.</i>
- I moved to Russia,

450
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:24,384
and I'm totally messing with you.

451
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,553
-None of that's true.
-<i>What?</i>

452
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:27,762
I would love to see you again.
I think about you all the time.

453
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,682
- Really?
<i>- Yeah. How about this Saturday?</i>

454
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:31,808
It's a date.

455
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:38,606
Ana?

456
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:42,111
Uh, no, it's just me,
giant chocolate Oscar guy.

457
00:22:42,193 --> 00:22:44,363
I'm here to pick up
the giant chocolate Oscar.

458
00:22:44,445 --> 00:22:49,034
My boss really wants our product
to only be seen with real Oscar nominees.

459
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:51,869
You know, to maintain the integrity
of the giant chocolate Oscar.

460
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,705
I don't care. Take it.

461
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:56,709
<i>You've reached Ana Spanakopita.</i>

462
00:22:56,791 --> 00:22:59,627
<i>How did you get this number?</i>
<i>Explain yourself.</i>

463
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,963
Ana, this is the fourth time I've called.

464
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,048
Please call me back. I need you.

465
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:08,011
Ana, please.
This is BoJack, by the way. Horseman.

466
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:11,390
Hey! Todd! Where you been?

467
00:23:11,472 --> 00:23:13,017
-Oh, hi.
-You were in Ojai?

468
00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:16,060
-No, I was just saying hi.
-Well, why not go to Ojai, huh?

469
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,271
You and me?
I could use an escape, couldn't you?

470
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:19,940
It's not really a good time.

471
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:22,483
Todd, I need this.
You're my best friend and I need you.

472
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,944
Don't leave me now.
Don't be like everybody else.

473
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,614
I'm not leaving you. I just--

474
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:30,366
Besides, I think you owe me, right?
After what you did?

475
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:32,493
-What I did?
-Come on, Todd. I know.

476
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:35,247
-Mr. Peanutbutter told me everything.
-Everything?

477
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:38,834
Even told you, when I was a kid, I used
to bang on my butt like a bongo drum

478
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:40,794
-when I got out of the bath?
-What?

479
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:43,588
<i>♪ Todd-o, me and Todd-o ♪</i>

480
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:47,050
<i>♪ Bath time come</i>
<i>Make Todd shiny and clean ♪</i>

481
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,470
Mm, no, not-not about that.

482
00:23:49,552 --> 00:23:51,471
So, he didn't tell you everything.

483
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,723
Did he tell you about the time
I counted to a million?

484
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:58,311
One, two, three, four, five, six--

485
00:23:58,394 --> 00:24:01,022
-No, stop.
-But I was just getting to the good part!

486
00:24:01,105 --> 00:24:04,692
What? Seven? He told me you didn't want
to nominate me for an Oscar.

487
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:06,444
-Oh, that.
-What the hell, man?

488
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,655
-After everything I've done for you?
-What are you talking about?

489
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:11,532
Oh, I don't know. Letting you live here
for free for six years?

490
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:14,243
Giving you food, indulging you
in your little projects and adventures

491
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:17,163
and stories about how you used to bang
on your butt like a bongo drum?

492
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:18,332
I let you turn my house

493
00:24:18,414 --> 00:24:19,916
into your company's headquarters
for the last month.

494
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,876
Yeah, but that's not
because you're my friend.

495
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,088
-That's because you felt bad about Emily.
-You know about Emily?

496
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:28,467
I think I know.
Why? What do you think I know?

497
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:29,801
I mean, I know what I think,

498
00:24:29,884 --> 00:24:33,681
but I don't know if the thing that I think
is the thing that you think I know.

499
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:36,141
-You know?
-So, you know I had sex with Emily.

500
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:38,477
You had sex with Emily?!

501
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,105
-Well, what did you think?
-I don't know! Not that!

502
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,940
I just knew something sketchy happened.

503
00:24:43,022 --> 00:24:45,233
I thought maybe you gave her
one of your weird monologues

504
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,527
about how sad you are,

505
00:24:46,609 --> 00:24:47,611
and it bummed her out!

506
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:49,988
Todd, I'm sorry, all right?
I screwed up.

507
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:54,159
-I know I screwed up. I don't know why--
-Oh, great! Of course! Here it comes!

508
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:55,827
You can't keep doing this!

509
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:59,580
You can't keep doing shitty things,
and then feel bad about yourself

510
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,416
like that makes it okay!

511
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,919
You need to be better!

512
00:25:04,001 --> 00:25:05,712
I know. And I'm sorry, okay?

513
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:09,758
I was drunk, and there was all this
pressure with the Oscar campaign.

514
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:15,138
-But now-- Now that it's over, I--
-No! No, BoJack, just stop.

515
00:25:15,221 --> 00:25:18,016
You are all the things
that are wrong with you.

516
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:20,269
It's not the alcohol, or the drugs,

517
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:23,271
or any of the shitty things
that happened to you in your career,

518
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,522
or when you were a kid.

519
00:25:24,605 --> 00:25:26,066
It's you.

520
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,903
All right? It's you.

521
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:36,535
