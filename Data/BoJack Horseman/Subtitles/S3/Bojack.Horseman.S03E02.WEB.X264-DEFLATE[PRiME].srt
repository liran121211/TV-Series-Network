If you're ready to finally stop being
"The Horse" from <i>Horsin' Around,</i>

165
00:08:34,372 --> 00:08:37,918
send me an e-mail:
Cuddlywhiskers@harvard.edu.

166
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:39,711
- That's H-A-R--
- I got it.

167
00:08:40,295 --> 00:08:41,546
[gasps]

168
00:08:43,882 --> 00:08:45,091
You got some mail, babe.

169
00:08:45,675 --> 00:08:48,887
Mwah! You understand I'm using
that pet name ironically, right?

170
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:49,971
Yes, Wayne.

171
00:08:50,055 --> 00:08:54,434
Oh, my God, check it out,
a rejection letter from <i>The New Yorker.</i>

172
00:08:54,517 --> 00:08:59,189
That magazine is for white people.
White people are the worst, right, guys?

173
00:08:59,731 --> 00:09:00,565
Yup.

174
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:03,234
"Dear Diane.
We are sorry to say that your piece,

175
00:09:03,318 --> 00:09:05,904
'An Open Letter to Open Letters',
wasn't right for us,

176
00:09:05,987 --> 00:09:09,407
despite its evident merit."
Do you know what this means?

177
00:09:09,491 --> 00:09:12,827
Caring leads to disappointment?
Trying is stupid and so is having dreams?

178
00:09:12,911 --> 00:09:15,830
Someone gave my piece a read
and decided against it.

179
00:09:15,914 --> 00:09:19,167
Their journalistic style
couldn't be more outmoded.

180
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:23,129
- Satire? More like "sa-tired."
- I never even thought they'd read it.

181
00:09:23,213 --> 00:09:27,425
"Talk of the Town"?
More like "Schlock of the Clown".

182
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:31,012
Then they typed me a letter
that said it had "obvious merit".

183
00:09:31,096 --> 00:09:33,974
"Shouts and Murmurs"?
More like "Louts and..."

184
00:09:34,057 --> 00:09:35,517
What rhymes with murmurs?

185
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,602
For two people
who don't like <i>The New Yorker,</i>

186
00:09:37,686 --> 00:09:40,563
you know a lot about the different
sections of <i>The New Yorker.</i>

187
00:09:42,107 --> 00:09:43,274
And then Cuddlywhiskers said:

188
00:09:43,358 --> 00:09:46,403
"What if we stopped thinking of TV
as a conduit to tell stories

189
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:48,780
and thinking of it
as a conduit to tell truth?"

190
00:09:48,863 --> 00:09:52,200
And I was like: "Damn, this guy
must have gone to Yale or something."

191
00:09:52,283 --> 00:09:54,160
Sounds like you two really hit it off.

192
00:09:54,244 --> 00:09:56,413
We were like Heidi and Spencer
up in there.

193
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:58,123
So you're gonna do the show?

194
00:09:58,206 --> 00:10:00,083
- Nah. Timing's really off right now.
- [sighs]

195
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:03,086
iPhone's coming out this year,
I need to gear up for that.

196
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:06,464
I'm done. That's it, I'm tired
of bending over backwards for you.

197
00:10:06,548 --> 00:10:08,842
I mean this in all seriousness,
professionally or in bed?

198
00:10:08,925 --> 00:10:11,636
Why won't you do this?
Give me one good reason.

199
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:17,267
Because his show sounds incredible.
And what if... I'm not?

200
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,687
What if there's a reason the only thing
I'm known for is <i>Horsin' Around?</i>

201
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:23,732
BoJack, you are amazing.

202
00:10:23,815 --> 00:10:27,318
You're bright and you're funny
and you're handsome and you're talented.

203
00:10:27,402 --> 00:10:29,404
But if you can't see that,

204
00:10:29,487 --> 00:10:32,615
then you're the biggest,
dumbest piece of shit in the world.

205
00:10:35,118 --> 00:10:38,121
- [pop music playing]
- [laughter and chatter]

206
00:10:40,123 --> 00:10:42,292
How long do we have to stay in here?

207
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,627
- It's called Seven Minutes in Heaven.
- Uh...

208
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:46,337
We don't have to kiss.

209
00:10:46,421 --> 00:10:48,631
I know you'd rather be in here
with Kimber.

210
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:51,509
That's not true. It's just that, Emily...

211
00:10:51,593 --> 00:10:54,304
- What?
- I've never kissed anyone before.

212
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:56,848
That's okay.
Maybe we can try with each other?

213
00:10:56,931 --> 00:11:00,602
That way, when you're in here with Kimber
one day, you'll know exactly what to do.

214
00:11:00,685 --> 00:11:06,024
Okay, so how should we do it?
French style, Eskimo, Butterfly?

215
00:11:06,107 --> 00:11:09,527
I'll tell you. I know exactly what to do
because I practice all the time

216
00:11:09,611 --> 00:11:11,654
with a picture of Adam Brody--
No, I don't!

217
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:12,697
[chuckles]

218
00:11:12,781 --> 00:11:16,618
Just close your eyes,
and we move our faces toward each other.

219
00:11:16,701 --> 00:11:20,580
- Okay.
- Until we...

220
00:11:25,043 --> 00:11:27,253
- [sighs]
- [Marv] Oh!

221
00:11:27,337 --> 00:11:31,049
Well, the elusive BoJack Horseman.

222
00:11:31,633 --> 00:11:36,763
You do, huh? Hey, Princess Carolyn,
guess who just got BoJack a job.

223
00:11:36,846 --> 00:11:41,518
You... are the secretary
of a wonderful agent.

224
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:45,230
Now go pick up
a pair of satin crotchless undies.

225
00:11:45,313 --> 00:11:48,107
I saw a stewardess
at the Yum Yum Donuts.

226
00:11:48,191 --> 00:11:50,568
We did not make eye contact.

227
00:11:51,736 --> 00:11:53,446
[man] <i>Good morning, Los Angeles.</i>

228
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:56,783
<i>It's two months later in 2007.</i>

229
00:11:56,866 --> 00:11:59,327
[man 2] <i>Two months later?</i>
<i>Two months later than what?</i>

230
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:00,703
[man 1] <i>Did I say two months later?</i>

231
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:04,040
<i>Cookie chartreuse brontosaurus,</i>
<i>I think I'm having a stroke.</i>

232
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:05,166
Aaah!

233
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,794
- Jeez, sleep much?
- Jeez, watch me sleep much?

234
00:12:07,877 --> 00:12:09,212
Well, I couldn't sleep.

235
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,214
I kept thinking about
today's first read-through.

236
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:12,966
These things
are always so nerve-wracking,

237
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:16,219
to sit there and perform
for all these people like some kind of a--

238
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,638
- Professional actor?
- Very funny.

239
00:12:18,721 --> 00:12:21,474
- Before I forget, I got you a present.
- [gasps]

240
00:12:21,558 --> 00:12:25,979
It's a box...
with crinkly tissue paper inside it.

241
00:12:26,062 --> 00:12:27,355
How did you know?

242
00:12:27,438 --> 00:12:29,274
Thank you
for putting this whole thing together.

243
00:12:29,357 --> 00:12:32,694
Even though I still can't believe
I let you talk me into this.

244
00:12:32,777 --> 00:12:34,612
Promise me
everything's going to be okay?

245
00:12:34,696 --> 00:12:36,823
I promise it's gonna be great.

246
00:12:36,906 --> 00:12:39,284
If you get scared,
look for me in the audience.

247
00:12:39,367 --> 00:12:43,121
I'll be there the whole time,
laughing and cheering louder than anyone.

248
00:12:43,204 --> 00:12:45,623
- Mmm...
- Mm-mmm-mm.

249
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:50,879
"Mitch tosses the vodka bottle
into the garbage. Thud."

250
00:12:50,962 --> 00:12:52,422
"Goodbye, old friend."

251
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:55,842
"Mitch turns off the light
and closes the door as we...

252
00:12:55,925 --> 00:12:58,428
Fade to black. End of episode."

253
00:13:01,764 --> 00:13:03,474
Thank you.

254
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:07,520
Let's see what the suits say.

255
00:13:07,604 --> 00:13:10,523
Bet they're gonna want to bland it up,
make it appeal to middle America.

256
00:13:10,607 --> 00:13:12,775
[groans] That's the worst part of America.

257
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:15,361
Other than the bottom,
the top and most of the sides.

258
00:13:15,445 --> 00:13:18,656
BoJack, Cuddlywhiskers,
what can we say?

259
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,910
This is why you guys are the pros
and we're just the schmoes.

260
00:13:21,993 --> 00:13:25,830
I think what my husband
is trying to say is, "Great job."

261
00:13:25,914 --> 00:13:27,290
Enough with the torture.

262
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:29,751
Don't have to feed me to finger me.
Just lay on the notes.

263
00:13:29,834 --> 00:13:32,462
[laughs] Our only note? No notes.

264
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:34,923
- No notes?
- We love this show.

265
00:13:35,006 --> 00:13:36,883
BoJack, I'm calling it right now.

266
00:13:36,966 --> 00:13:40,219
This show is gonna be as big
as <i>Horsin' Around.</i>

267
00:13:40,303 --> 00:13:41,679
[gulps]

268
00:13:41,763 --> 00:13:43,222
Huh.

269
00:13:43,306 --> 00:13:49,145
And then Justin said, "Jessica Biel?
You are un-Jessica-Bielievable."

270
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:51,022
- It was so funny.
- Wow.

271
00:13:51,105 --> 00:13:54,275
It seems like you're really
in sync with this Justin guy.

272
00:13:54,359 --> 00:13:57,111
You should do all the things
with him that I can't do.

273
00:13:57,195 --> 00:14:01,324
Like eat chocolate,
or enjoy fireworks, or watch tennis.

274
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:05,161
Why, tennis makes me so mad.
Why doesn't anyone ever catch the ball?

275
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:08,164
Hello? Can we please get
some service in this place?

276
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:12,585
I'm famous actress Jessica Biel.
I'm one of the Jessicas.

277
00:14:12,669 --> 00:14:15,254
Mom, I'm finally gonna be
a published writer.

278
00:14:15,338 --> 00:14:18,675
My "Open Letter to Open Letters"
is going to be published in McSweeney's.

279
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:20,885
Mc-What? Who's that? Some Irish?

280
00:14:20,969 --> 00:14:24,013
No, Mom. It's a very popular website.

281
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:26,724
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm not falling for that scam.

282
00:14:26,808 --> 00:14:30,186
Website? We gotta print it out
on our own paper with our own ink?

283
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,604
<i>- I don't think so.</i>
- Mom.

284
00:14:31,688 --> 00:14:35,149
And my Blockbuster original series
has been keeping me very busy.

285
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:37,652
I still don't get how that's gonna work,
at all.

286
00:14:37,735 --> 00:14:39,487
Babe, it makes total sense.

287
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:42,031
They make the whole season,
put it on six DVD's.

288
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:44,117
People go to their local Blockbuster Video

289
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,953
and rent it out one disc at a time
for five days each.

290
00:14:47,036 --> 00:14:49,080
What if someone already rented
the episodes they want?

291
00:14:49,163 --> 00:14:53,001
They can just get something else,
like <i>The Illusionist </i>or <i>The Prestige.</i>

292
00:14:53,084 --> 00:14:55,795
- Whichever one you were in.
- Do you know which one?

293
00:14:55,878 --> 00:14:58,298
- Do you?
- [groans]

294
00:14:58,381 --> 00:15:03,011
- Why do you say yes to everything?
- I get excited by the possibilities.

295
00:15:03,094 --> 00:15:06,180
Look, a CD, at a coffee shop?
That is crazy.

296
00:15:06,264 --> 00:15:08,141
- Buying it.
- Eh-eh eh-eh! No.

297
00:15:08,224 --> 00:15:10,101
- Drop it. Drop it.
- [whimpers]

298
00:15:10,184 --> 00:15:11,394
Good boy.

299
00:15:12,729 --> 00:15:16,566
Buzz-buzz-buzz buzz buzz-buzz!

300
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:19,152
- You heard what the network said.
- Heard they loved it.

301
00:15:19,235 --> 00:15:20,820
Yoo-hoo! I also heard that.

302
00:15:20,903 --> 00:15:22,947
Exactly. The network loved it.

303
00:15:23,031 --> 00:15:24,824
Obviously, we're playing it too safe.

304
00:15:24,907 --> 00:15:28,244
If you want my opinion, fellas,
you hit oil, stop drilling.

305
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:32,248
"I am an oil man.
I drink your milkshake."

306
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:35,710
- That'll be funny in a year or so.
- Before that got sad and weird,

307
00:15:35,793 --> 00:15:38,171
you said, "If you want my opinion,"
and we don't.

308
00:15:38,254 --> 00:15:41,007
Cuddlywhiskers, you told me
you wanted to do something different.

309
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:44,635
Now we're doing something that's gonna be
"just as good as <i>Horsin' Around</i>."

310
00:15:44,719 --> 00:15:46,971
Is that what you wanted?
That's not why I'm here.

311
00:15:47,055 --> 00:15:49,682
- I know.
- I really think you're making a mistake.

312
00:15:49,766 --> 00:15:51,184
I'm not taking career advice

313
00:15:51,267 --> 00:15:53,686
from somebody who's been
an assistant the last 14 years.

314
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:56,481
Is that how you think of me?
As your agent's assistant?

315
00:15:56,564 --> 00:15:59,025
- What do you think you are?
- I don't know.

316
00:15:59,108 --> 00:16:01,110
Here's some free advice:
you should know.

317
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:03,071
Why don't you leave this to the grown-ups?

318
00:16:03,154 --> 00:16:05,031
Somebody needs coffee,
I'll give you a ring.

319
00:16:05,114 --> 00:16:06,908
Okay, best of luck.

320
00:16:06,991 --> 00:16:08,159
[clears throat]

321
00:16:08,242 --> 00:16:10,953
Cuddlywhiskers,
let's give ourselves one night

322
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:15,625
to stick our dicks in this script
and go balls deep into the universe.

323
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:16,918
I'm in.

324
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:22,799
What's that, you say?
There's a panic? At the disco?

325
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:24,801
I gotta go. What do you want, Toots?

326
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:27,470
I want to be an agent. I think I'm ready.

327
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:30,473
[groans] Again with this
"I wanna be a female agent" thing.

328
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:34,894
They don't even have a word for it.
Uh, agentess, agentrix.

329
00:16:34,977 --> 00:16:38,231
- It's just called "agent", Marv, agent.
- Okay, okay!

330
00:16:38,314 --> 00:16:42,151
You're an agent, all right?
I dub thee agent.

331
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:44,946
You can even take my office,
because I quit.

332
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:46,781
- What?
- Who needs the headache?

333
00:16:46,864 --> 00:16:53,121
Thirty years I threw into this job
and it destroyed me from the inside out.

334
00:16:53,204 --> 00:16:56,916
I never fell in love,
I never had a family.

335
00:16:56,999 --> 00:17:00,169
I never even got to give that lacy teddy

336
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:03,381
to the mean woman who worked at the DMV.

337
00:17:03,464 --> 00:17:07,635
[sighs] All I have is regrets.

338
00:17:08,344 --> 00:17:13,182
Oh, my God, I'm an agent!
I'm gonna make it after all.

339
00:17:15,017 --> 00:17:16,936
Whaah!

340
00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:19,981
First thing I'm gonna do
is get rid of that ceiling fan.

341
00:17:21,899 --> 00:17:25,403
How do we make it clear
that this isn't <i>Horsin' Around?</i>

342
00:17:25,486 --> 00:17:28,489
What if in the very first scene,
we show my character

343
00:17:28,573 --> 00:17:33,744
literally taking a massive dump
on a VHS copy of <i>Horsin' Around?</i>

344
00:17:33,828 --> 00:17:35,079
What? That's insane.

345
00:17:35,163 --> 00:17:38,040
Let's just put it in,
we can always take it out later.

346
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:40,543
I want this character to be really edgy,

347
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:43,337
the kind of character Denis Leary
would be offered and then say:

348
00:17:43,421 --> 00:17:45,089
"This character's too edgy for me."

349
00:17:45,173 --> 00:17:47,633
What if he had a catchphrase
that was an anti-catchphrase?

350
00:17:47,717 --> 00:17:51,554
Like if every time he entered the room
he was like, "Whassup, bitches?"

351
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,891
Not that, because that's horrible.
But something like that.

352
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:55,850
Whassup, bitches?

353
00:17:55,933 --> 00:17:58,102
- That is so dumb.
- But kind of brilliant, right?

354
00:17:58,186 --> 00:18:01,481
Yes, put that in.
Put all this in, this should be the show.

355
00:18:01,564 --> 00:18:04,192
This should be the show.

356
00:18:04,275 --> 00:18:07,111
I haven't felt this alive
since the head of the Charles Regatta.

357
00:18:07,195 --> 00:18:09,739
- That's a Harvard thing.
- Yes. This is brilliant.

358
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:12,825
What if we had five minutes of him
reading a book to himself?

359
00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:14,202
Oh, my God, yes.

360
00:18:14,285 --> 00:18:17,371
Just him turning the page.
A close-up of my eyeball.

361
00:18:17,455 --> 00:18:20,458
- [bottle breaks]
- The real shit, they never show that.

362
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,752
Wow, we did it.

363
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:27,006
We stayed up all night, but we really made
something new and different and daring.

364
00:18:27,089 --> 00:18:28,674
We've changed everything but the title.

365
00:18:28,758 --> 00:18:31,219
Well, then, how about
we give it a new title?

366
00:18:31,302 --> 00:18:33,429
- <i>The BoJack Horseman Show.</i>
- [gasps]

367
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:35,848
Oh, Cuddlywhiskers,
I don't know what to say.

368
00:18:35,932 --> 00:18:39,268
Well, then why don't you just say,
"Whassup, bitches?"

369
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:41,103
But, you know, not that.

370
00:18:41,187 --> 00:18:43,481
- Something like that.
- We'll figure it out.

371
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:50,780
Seriously, can I hear 400 dollars?
Let's not forget why we're here tonight.

372
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:53,032
To raise money
for the John Edwards campaign.

373
00:18:53,115 --> 00:18:55,326
I was talking
to one of the volunteers earlier

374
00:18:55,409 --> 00:18:58,496
and she was just gushing
about how John Edwards touched her.

375
00:18:58,579 --> 00:19:02,625
I say, let's make this man president
so he can touch whoever he wants.

376
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,253
- Four hundred dollars.
- I don't know what's cheesier,

377
00:19:05,336 --> 00:19:07,797
this three-cheese risotto
or that dude's patter.

378
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,756
Seriously.

379
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:13,219
This fundraiser should have a fundraiser
for a better host of this fundraiser.

380
00:19:13,302 --> 00:19:14,178
Totes McGotes.

381
00:19:14,262 --> 00:19:16,889
I'll post that to my Twitter page.
You should follow me.

382
00:19:16,973 --> 00:19:20,601
I'm A with a circle around it,
"insWayne in the membWayne".

383
00:19:20,685 --> 00:19:22,186
- [Diane sighs]
- What's a Twitter page?

384
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:26,649
[chuckling] Erica, you know you're not
allowed to vote in national elections.

385
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:29,485
[electronic music playing]

386
00:19:31,529 --> 00:19:33,990
You sure it's okay
to be in your parents' bedroom?

387
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:37,910
Todd, so we've been together
for months now.

388
00:19:37,994 --> 00:19:42,081
Um, I was thinking maybe that we try sex?

389
00:19:42,164 --> 00:19:42,999
Uh...

390
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:45,835
We don't have to.
I don't wanna peer pressure you.

391
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:50,089
No. I'm ready for sexual situations.

392
00:19:50,172 --> 00:19:53,843
- Um...
- Hooray. Um, taking your virginity.

393
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,761
Yeah, sure. That's how I would say it.

394
00:19:55,845 --> 00:20:01,017
Okay, here we-- Here I go.
Uh, this is Todd doing sex.

395
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,477
- [garage door opening]
- Did you hear that?

396
00:20:03,561 --> 00:20:07,148
Oh, snap. My dad's home early.
You gotta get out of here.

397
00:20:07,231 --> 00:20:08,774
Your dad, the mobster?

398
00:20:08,858 --> 00:20:10,359
What? My dad's not a mobster.

399
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:12,778
You said he was like that guy
from <i>The Sopranos.</i>

400
00:20:12,862 --> 00:20:15,489
I said he works on <i>The Sopranos</i>.
He's an editor.

401
00:20:15,573 --> 00:20:17,491
Oh, God, oh, God! Even worse.

402
00:20:17,575 --> 00:20:19,869
He must be so desensitized to violence

403
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:22,872
and nihilistic ruminations
on the banality of evil.

404
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:25,124
Here, out the window.
You love shimmying, right?

405
00:20:25,207 --> 00:20:28,961
You know I love shimmying,
but that's a two-story drop.

406
00:20:29,045 --> 00:20:30,504
Use this.

407
00:20:32,173 --> 00:20:33,966
- Go, get out. Go, go!
- Uh, okay.

408
00:20:35,217 --> 00:20:36,677
Oh, shit.

409
00:20:37,261 --> 00:20:38,554
[grunts]
Sorry.

410
00:20:41,349 --> 00:20:42,475
[panting]

411
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:45,645
Whoa, whoa, Tony marries Dr. Melfi?

412
00:20:45,728 --> 00:20:47,980
<i>Mamma mia!</i>

413
00:20:52,526 --> 00:20:55,821
- So, the island's purgatory, right?
- What's really happening--

414
00:20:55,905 --> 00:20:57,239
- Hold that thought.
- [groans]

415
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:59,867
Hey, Princess Carolyn, you came.

416
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:03,746
I figured since I'm your agent, I should
at least show up to your premiere party.

417
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:06,582
I know I haven't called in a while.
I've been really busy.

418
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:09,001
I figured you'd call me
if you needed a coffee.

419
00:21:09,085 --> 00:21:10,920
Ouch.

420
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:13,339
Hey, big premiere tonight.
Very exciting.

421
00:21:13,422 --> 00:21:14,256
Yeah.

422
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,468
After tonight, it's no more "Aren't you
the horse from <i>Horsin' Around?"</i>

423
00:21:17,551 --> 00:21:20,429
From now on it'll be,
"You're BoJack Horseman."

424
00:21:20,513 --> 00:21:22,306
I'm happy for you, BoJack.

425
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,975
- How about a kiss for good luck?
- No, BoJack.

426
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:28,646
I'm your agent and your friend,
and I will always support you.

427
00:21:28,729 --> 00:21:32,900
But I'm 33 years old, and I want
to have a family by the time I'm 40.

428
00:21:32,983 --> 00:21:36,529
I don't want to spend the next seven years
in and out of love with you.

429
00:21:36,612 --> 00:21:39,490
I've wasted too much time
waiting for things to happen.

430
00:21:39,573 --> 00:21:41,242
And I'm not gonna wait anymore.

431
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,955
And for what it's worth, I always liked
the horse from <i>Horsin' Around.</i>

432
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:49,250
- You did?
- Yeah. Everybody did.

433
00:21:51,711 --> 00:21:55,005
Unbelievable.
Un-Jessica-Bielievable.

434
00:21:55,089 --> 00:21:57,174
Can we not fight while I'm at a gig?

435
00:21:57,258 --> 00:22:00,469
There are a lot of big producers,
this could be my next big break.

436
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:02,847
[groans]
This podunk benefit is below us.

437
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:06,976
I'm about to be in what I've been told
is a very important gay rights movie,

438
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:08,769
<i>I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry.</i>

439
00:22:08,853 --> 00:22:12,857
I now pronounce me very impressed,
but I'm not getting those kinds of offers.

440
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:17,695
- As Justin would say, "Cry me a river."
- Hey, if you like Justin so much,

441
00:22:17,778 --> 00:22:20,489
maybe you should just continue
to be really good friends with him.

442
00:22:20,573 --> 00:22:22,324
Fine, maybe I will marry Justin.

443
00:22:22,408 --> 00:22:23,909
Uh, I didn't say that.

444
00:22:23,993 --> 00:22:27,746
I now pronounce this marriage over.
Biel with it.

445
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,415
[sobbing]

446
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:33,502
- You wanted water?
- Thanks.

447
00:22:33,586 --> 00:22:37,131
Wait. Blarn, right?
Yeah, from the coffee shop.

448
00:22:37,214 --> 00:22:40,301
What are you doing here?
Is there coffee to "bariste"?

449
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:43,262
I also do cater waiter gigs
to make ends meet.

450
00:22:43,345 --> 00:22:47,433
You "bariste" and cater <i>and</i> waiter?
[laughs] Triple threat.

451
00:22:47,516 --> 00:22:49,351
I should be bringing you the water.

452
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:53,981
You know, just for the record, I think
it's cool that you put yourself out there.

453
00:22:54,064 --> 00:22:56,525
A lot of guys in your position
wouldn't take gigs like this.

454
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:58,819
They'd be afraid people
would make fun of them.

455
00:22:58,903 --> 00:22:59,778
That's dumb.

456
00:22:59,862 --> 00:23:02,990
If you care about what other people think,
you're never gonna do anything.

457
00:23:03,073 --> 00:23:06,327
- Yeah, you're right.
- Oh, my God, I'm so glad you agree.

458
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:09,413
I was like, "Why did I say that?
That was so dumb."

459
00:23:09,497 --> 00:23:12,583
Then you were like, "That's right."
And I was like, "Ooh! Validation."

460
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:15,461
- Hey, mind if I change out of this shirt?
- Go ahead.

461
00:23:15,544 --> 00:23:17,713
[groans] This monkey suit is killing me.

462
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:20,174
Oof! Hey there, Delilah.

463
00:23:21,509 --> 00:23:24,136
Sweet hang, Blarn.
You're one in a million.

464
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,514
- Actually, my name isn't Blarn.
- What?

465
00:23:26,597 --> 00:23:28,891
I put that on my nametag as a dumb joke

466
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:31,393
to subvert the idea
of co-opting personal identity

467
00:23:31,477 --> 00:23:35,064
to further corporate branding which,
as I'm saying it, isn't much of a joke.

468
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:36,315
[laughing]

469
00:23:36,398 --> 00:23:39,985
"Blarn." That is very funny.
You should be a writer.

470
00:23:40,069 --> 00:23:41,987
Thanks. I'm Diane.

471
00:23:42,071 --> 00:23:43,822
- Mr. Peanutbutter.
- Yeah, I know.

472
00:23:43,906 --> 00:23:45,533
- Add me on MySpace, okay?
- Sure.

473
00:23:45,616 --> 00:23:49,954
All right.
Guess I'll see you around, Diana.

474
00:23:50,621 --> 00:23:52,081
It's Diane.

475
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:56,126
Hey, buddy, slight change of plans.

476
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:58,212
Call it off.
Call the whole thing off.

477
00:23:58,295 --> 00:24:00,589
What do you mean?
We premiere in two minutes.

478
00:24:00,673 --> 00:24:02,299
Call the network,
cancel the whole thing.

479
00:24:02,383 --> 00:24:04,760
Nobody wants to see me take a dump
on a <i>Horsin' Around</i> VHS.

480
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:08,639
BoJack, it's going to be fine.
This is what we wanted, remember?

481
00:24:08,722 --> 00:24:11,016
Easy for you to say.
It's my name on the show.

482
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,478
This is why I didn't want to do
another TV show. Everything was perfect.

483
00:24:14,562 --> 00:24:17,731
BoJack, this shit is bananas.
B-A-N-A-N-A-S.

484
00:24:17,815 --> 00:24:19,817
I can't promise everyone
will love this show.

485
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,652
No matter what, people will remember it.

486
00:24:21,735 --> 00:24:25,197
Five, ten years from now, this is the show
people will associate you with,

487
00:24:25,281 --> 00:24:27,032
and you'll be glad they do.

488
00:24:27,116 --> 00:24:29,994
Because this show is real,
it's edgy, it's different.

489
00:24:30,077 --> 00:24:32,454
A lesser talent
couldn't have pulled it off.

490
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:34,915
But I'm willing to bet
on BoJack Horseman.

491
00:24:34,999 --> 00:24:37,543
- Are you?
- Yes, I am.

492
00:24:37,626 --> 00:24:42,089
Great. Because the show is starting
and your life is about to change forever,

493
00:24:42,172 --> 00:24:44,717
in three, two, one.
