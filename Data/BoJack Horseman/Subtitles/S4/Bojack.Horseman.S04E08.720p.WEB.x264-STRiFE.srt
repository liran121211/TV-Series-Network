1
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,973
So I send in the form, and if
my mom wants to meet me too,

2
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:16,266
- then we meet?
- Yeah.

3
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,750
And if she doesn't want to meet me,

4
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:21,188
then I get to feel that hot sting
of rejection all over again.

5

What is F.H.B.A.?

10
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:38,330
I think it's one of those shows about
Navy sex crimes that have gone cold?

11
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:41,917
And there may be numbers or something?
Then, they call "the Judge."

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,919
I'm just excited to
get out of the house.

13
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,421
I've been getting really fidgety
cooped up on that hill.

14
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:48,265
Like I got tiny little
bumps crawling around

15
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,716
on the inside of my skin, you know?

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,095
Totally. Look at this guy, texting
in the middle of the intersection.

You have been judged
to be a shitty driver.

It feels good to be a
dramatic actor again.

To make someone laugh
is a craft, to be sure,

23
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,697
but to make someone cry, on
purpose, that is a precious gift.

Can I get you anything? Water?

my daughter to "video village"?

me at my most awesome,

to avoid appearance of a double chin.

like to say to the contestants

Whoa, BoJack, no. That is so degrading.

So if it's not about their butts, then
why is the other judge Sir Mix-A-Lot?

Because I'm an honest
and impartial judge.

for, it's that I cannot lie.

is Woodchuck also "unbeata-Biel"?

I'm tired of these politicians
who are all talk.

503
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:37,004
California needs a leader who
excels in both comedy and drama

00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:39,507
and who is beautiful in an
approachable girl-next-door way,

Of course, Katrina would
latch onto Jessica

her dangerous agenda.

Well, there's no way they
could beat Woodchuck, right?

516
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,324
No? Because I almost beat him

517
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,159
and I don't even know
what a governor does.

518

That's true. Mr. Peanutbutter,
you've got to help.

this is the right thing for us?
