171
00:07:25,363 --> 00:07:27,824
But when I called the
number that you gave me,

172
00:07:27,908 --> 00:07:30,368
it was for a sandwich shop in Temecula.

173
00:07:30,374 --> 00:07:32,252
Wha...? That's so weird.

174
00:07:32,283 --> 00:07:33,616
You must have dialed it wrong.

175
00:07:33,622 --> 00:07:35,582
And then I thought, well, you know,

176
00:07:35,638 --> 00:07:37,912
sooner or later you'd call me.

177
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:40,264

00:07:41,922 --> 00:07:44,549
- Can you ever forgive me?
- I think so.

Oh! I'm so sorry.

Where are my manners? Please come in.

186
00:07:58,188 --> 00:08:01,066
it really gave our sex life the edge.

Isn't this just gonna
make them feel bad?

I don't have an office.

Fine. Can I talk to you in the hot-take,

Whoa, Stefani, that's not...

between an employee and her superior.

Mr. Peanutbutter so excited,

00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,783
and I am supporting that.

215
00:08:57,789 --> 00:08:58,951
But if I'm being honest,

216
00:08:58,957 --> 00:09:01,751
I can't wait for it to be over

- Yes.
- Oh! I need to show you something.

Okay, so this may seem cuckoo,

238
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:54,220

that after we made sweet love,
and he didn't call me again,

I just got so jealous, so I made

241
00:09:59,735 --> 00:10:01,388
a list of every girl he was with...

242
00:10:01,394 --> 00:10:03,432

Does this woman look eight
months pregnant to you?

Richard Gere had just
done "Runaway Bride",

hot off "Girl, Interrupted"

I looked it up on the Internet
