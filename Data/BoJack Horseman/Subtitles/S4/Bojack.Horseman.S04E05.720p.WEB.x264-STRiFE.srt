168
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,821
Mrs. Horseman, you have a visitor.

169
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:10,865
Oh, uh...

170
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:13,410
- Hi, Mom.
- Do I know you?

171
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,371
Here we go. Yes, Mom, I never visit.
You got me.

172
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,581
- Henrietta?
- Okay, we're doing this?

173
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,625
I think she really doesn't
know who you are.

174
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,589
She knows. This is just
like when she pretended

175
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,755
not to recognize me after my shaky
choir solo in eighth grade.

176
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,799
I had to get a ride
home with the pianist

177
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,218
who liked to tickle a lot
more than just the ivories.

178
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:33,888
When I made it home unscathed, she
said, "Huh. I guess no one wants you."

179
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:36,933
Henrietta, could I trouble you
for some orange juice, please?

Stop calling me Henrietta!
Nobody here's named Henrietta!

Henrietta, orange juice. Now!

182

You're not being paid for
polite conversation.

- Oh, hello! It's you.

185
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:51,948
I must apologize for Henrietta. She
learned to read on secondhand books.

Mom, do you really not know who I am?
Me, famous BoJack?

If you are getting orange
juice, I'd love a glass too.

Oh. Uh, okay.

189
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:07,380
So you see I'm really quite
ordinary and relatable.

190
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:09,883
Yeah, you put your pants
on one leg at a time.

191
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:13,011
Well, I step into my
pants one leg at a time,

192
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:16,347
then my trouser-maidens lift the legs
simultaneously to avoid wrinklage.

193
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:19,517
Well, right, of course, why
else have trouser-maidens?

- Hey. Konichiwa, Princess Mulan.
- Just leave us alone, okay?

195
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,689
I was giving you a compliment.

196
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:27,253
First, konichiwa is not a compliment,
it's Japanese for hello.

197
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,526
Second, I'm not Japanese.

198
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,862
Maybe I could put something
in that sweet mouth of yours

199
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,114
- so you don't have to talk so much.
- Whoa!

00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:34,866
One more step, asshole.

- What...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

I don't know! My instincts
just kicked in.

Why do you even have a gun?

207
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,714
Well, using it in the
movie was so empowering,

and now I just carry it everywhere.
Do you want to hold it?

209
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,511
No, I am very anti-gun.

210
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,013
In fact, I think the whole
idea of guns is inherently...

Holy shit, I'm holding a gun. How
long has this been in my hand?

- Slides right in, doesn't it?
- It actually feels kind of nice.

- Yes.

for the alarming creep of dementia.

- Thank you, very colorful.

the number you gave us

00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,896
connected to a sandwich
shop in Temecula.

starts to get annoying.

this movie on the shelf

00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,912
next to that wacky vacation comedy
we did about the klutzy babysitter.

doing on this call?

00:14:34,713 --> 00:14:36,918
Imagining that funny movie
you just described.

318
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,170
Okay, what do all these
shootings have in common?

have to be afraid anymore.

00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,059
- Yeah, now you're talking.
- When you put it that way,

00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,024
it almost sounds like
these mass shootings

325
00:14:55,071 --> 00:14:56,511
could be a good thing for the movie.

00:14:56,535 --> 00:14:59,315
No, no, no, of course not.
They're a terrible tragedy.

Thoughts and prayers
are with the victims.

00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,693
- Right, thoughts and prayers.
- But...

329
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:07,490
anything that makes women feel unsafe
might actually help our box office.

330
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,378
But you don't want women to feel unsafe.

00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:14,506
The only thing I like,

496
00:22:14,544 --> 00:22:16,344
- is rap music songs.
- [GROANING AND PANTING]

497
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:18,462
Make this stop. How do I turn this off?

498
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:22,007
Don't change it. I want to
see if this married couple

499
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:24,176
can work through their differences.

500
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,780
- Gimme the remote!
- This isn't right!

501
00:22:25,804 --> 00:22:27,596
- Guys, sharing is caring!
- [GRUNTS]

502
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,473
Oh, my God. Code red, code red!

503
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:31,595
What is happening? I don't like this!

504
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:32,685
No!

505
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,008
- [BEA] Let go of me.
- Oh, God.

506
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:37,773
I am the heiress to the
Sugarman Sugarcube Company.

507
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,317
You can't do this to me!

508

[SCREAMING]

509
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:45,406
I never get to watch what I want.

510
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:49,952
You think we should still
finish the episode, or...?

511
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:54,373
Our insurance policy is
very strict and very clear.

512
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:57,418
Once a resident becomes violent,
we can no longer house them.

513
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,003
Can you recommend another facility?

514
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,006
Frankly, at your mother's
rate of deterioration,

515
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,506
she probably doesn't have much time.

516
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,759
I recommend she spend it surrounded
by the people who care about her.

517
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:07,643
Okay, who are they? Do
you have their number?

518
00:23:07,667 --> 00:23:09,923
I was referring to you
and your daughter.

519
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,368
- Oh. Uh...
- We'll take her.

520
00:23:11,415 --> 00:23:12,540
She can have the guest room,

521
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,269
- and I can sleep on the couch. Right?
- [GROANS]

522
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:18,063
Okay. If she really doesn't
have much time left.

523
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:20,587
But if we get to this time next
year, she's still hanging on,

524
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:23,611
you will be getting a very
strongly worded letter, mister.

525
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:27,865
Excuse me, could you point me
in the direction of an H&M?

526
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,158
- Sure.
- [CLICK]

527
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,410
That's all we got, once
we took out all the guns.

528
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,287
Maybe it could work
as an H&M commercial?

529
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,497
It's a shame. It was a great movie.

530
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,875
[SIGHS] Yeah. Cut down in
the prime of its life.

531
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,210
Well, I'm very sorry for your loss.

532
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:42,421
Eh, I'll be fine.

533
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:48,469
Hey, Beatrice, you hungry?
I could make Pop-Tarts.

534
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,512
[BEA] No, thank you.

535
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:53,140
You want to watch another
Horsin' Around episode?

536
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,433
What's the point?

537
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,352
- Oh.
- [GROWLS]

538
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,686
Oh, God.

539
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:08,864
I'm sorry you didn't get
to tell your mom off.

540
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,907
I keep thinking about all
the things I never said

541
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,189
because I was so sure there'd
be other days to say them.

542
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,704
- Why don't you tell her now?
- It's not the same.

543
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:17,828
I should have done it back
when she knew who I was,

544
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,249
back when it would mean something.

545
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:20,709
But now, she's gonna die

546
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,878
and she's never gonna know
just how much I hate her.

547
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,922
I'm sure she knew, BoJack.

548
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:28,050
- Yeah? You're not just saying that?
- She read your book, didn't she?

549
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:31,720
[SIGHS] Yeah, but I really
wanted to say it to her face.

550
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:36,767
Well, hey, she's here now, right?
And she has good days and bad days.

551
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:41,939
Maybe, eventually, she'll recognize you.
And then you can totally rip into her.

552
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:43,732
- You really think so?
- Mm-hmm.
