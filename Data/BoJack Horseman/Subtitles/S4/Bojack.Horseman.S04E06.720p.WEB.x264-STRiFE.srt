dipped in brandy at some point?

So, instead of talking
through your issues,

your new thing is to just
get in really big fights

336
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,029
and then have hot angry sex?

Hey, Diane, can I get
your advice on something?

Yeah, of course. I'm not doing anything.

- Um...
- So, I have this friend,

344
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:26,801
and his name is Darnarius McQuimberton.

345
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,970
Oh, yeah, I think I read
an article about him

346
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,514
in Real, Not Made-Up, Person Magazine.

347
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,767
Darnarius is supposed to
get married this weekend.

348
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:38,980
And it's going to be an amazing wedding,
but it's kind of based on a lie.

Should he go through with it?

00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:43,943
Well, all weddings are lies, right?
Sort of.

351
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,862
You're making this big declaration

about how you're gonna stay
with this person forever,

353

but you don't actually know that.

354
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,702
You're just saying it. The
whole thing is a farce.

355
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:56,664
- Yeah, that's true.
- But it's a lie based on truth.

356
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,416
Like, at the center of the farce

357
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,085
there's this nugget of
something real and pure.

358
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:04,005
And that strange beautiful something

359
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,424
is why you put up with
everything else, right?

360
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,508
I guess so.

361
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:11,554
And sometimes it's hard to
remember that pure, shining thing

362
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,599
because it's been painted
over with so many arguments

363

and compromises and disappointments.

364
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:20,271
But you have to believe it's
still down there somewhere,

even if you can't see it.

366
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:26,235
And maybe even the belief in it is
more important than the thing itself,

367
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,946
but only as long as
you still believe it.

lie there's a truth.

That's the Tootsie Roll, and
that's why people get married.

be a lie without any truth in it,

If you'd like to never see him again,
I have ways of getting rid of him.

What kind of ways?

497

Asking him politely to not come back.
Actually, that's only one way.

You don't think I'm like that?

504

No, because you care about
people other than yourself.
