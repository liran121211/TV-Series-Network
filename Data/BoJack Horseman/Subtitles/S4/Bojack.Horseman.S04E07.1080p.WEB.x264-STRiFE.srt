1
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:15,140
Whew.

2
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,519
- BoJack?
- I'm back in L.A.

3
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:21,230
- I should have called you...
- Yeah. You should have.

4
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:23,357
- I said I was sorry.
- No, you didn't.

5
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:26,985
- Okay. Good to hear from you, BoJack.
- No...

6
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:28,820
Ugh.

7
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:36,286
What the...?

8
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:38,747
Okay, thank you.

9
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:40,415
What's going on here?

10
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:43,919
Fundraising dinner for the
Peanutbutter for California campaign.

11
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:47,005
- All right, I'm just gonna...
- Sorry. It's a fundraiser.

12
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:48,757
- Uh...
- BoJack!

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,759
I love your ironic take
on black-tie attire.

14
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:54,012
It really says, "I truly don't
care what you think of me."

15
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:56,536
This light bulb won't let me in
to your house without paying.

16
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:59,726
Ah, sorry about that.
Gotta raise those funds.

17
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,810
- Can't I just...
- Thanks for your support, buddy.

18
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,522
- Means so much. Erica!
- Hey...

19
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,899
Look at you, with the
right number of ears!

20
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:08,193
- Look, I just...
- Twenty thousand dollars a plate.

21
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,115
Hmm...!

22
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,199
Oh.

23
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:17,494
Hey, do you have another bathroom?
They're all occupied, and I gotta pee.

24
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,079
Not because I'm pregnant or anything.

25
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:22,042
Because if I were pregnant, it would
be bad luck to tell you this early.

26
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,882
Presuming it was early.
But I'm not pregnant.

27
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:26,586
This is just a normal, non-pregnant
gal type of having to pee.

28
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,070
- There's a bathroom in the pool house.
- You're a lifesaver.

29
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:30,465
Pardon me! Out of my way.

30
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:32,217
Uh-oh. Am I in Ithaca?

31
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:34,678
Because you are looking
"gorges" this evening.

32
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:39,308
Well, I must be in Nazi Germany,
because you're "not so" bad yourself.

33
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:41,601
- I'm sorry, yours was better.
- Hi.

34
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:43,061
Whoa.

35
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,521
Well, I should go.

36
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:49,276
Looks like the work wife/ex-wife
is talking to my other ex-wife.

37
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,321
- You have two ex-wives here?
- Katrina's his campaign manager.

38
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:53,884
And Jessica Biel loves

39
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,834
getting photographed
at fancy fundraisers.

40
00:01:55,858 --> 00:02:00,203
If it isn't my two favorite ladies,
in the same room! This is great.

41
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,913
- Hey.
- BoJack, I'm busy.

42
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:03,677
You haven't seen me for
a year and a half.

43
00:02:03,701 --> 00:02:05,941
Yeah, because you disapp...
No, I am not doing this now.

44
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:08,319
- Why don't you get yourself a drink?
- I will get a drink.

45
00:02:08,343 --> 00:02:11,222
I will get $20,000 worth of drinks.

46
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,302
Oh, Norman, we have to support the...

47
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,779
- Ooh, yes.
- All right.

48
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:19,526
Hi, Zach Braff. Zach Braff.

49
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:21,808
Hey there. Famous actor
Zach Braff, how you doing?

50
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:22,972
Everyone?

51
00:02:23,024 --> 00:02:24,460
Thank you all for being here.

52
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,939
We're gonna beat that scoundrel
Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz...

53
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:29,232
Boo!

54
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:32,488
...and bring likability
back to politics.

55
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,168
I especially want to thank my

56
00:02:35,273 --> 00:02:37,419
pro-fracking pals for
being here tonight.

57
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:41,119
You know, my wife said, "Don't
frack," but we did it anyway,

58
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,484
and it all worked out.

59
00:02:42,578 --> 00:02:44,289
- Love you, sweetie.
- Mm-hmm.

60
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:46,416
Finally... oh! Sorry about that, folks.

61
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,460
I sensed an earthquake.
Must have been a false...

62
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:49,961
Oh, hey now!

63
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:51,797
Nope, I was definitely wrong.

64
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,383
Listen to me, I'm the dog
who cried earthquake.

65
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:59,971
- We're gonna die!
- Oh, fudge!

66
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:02,182
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- I can't die!

67
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:06,103
I'm not famous enough yet to make the
"In Memoriam" montage at the Oscars!

68
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,562
I have so many regrets!

69
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:10,482
I just picked up a family sitcom
where the mom is a zombie!

70
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:14,903
It's called Mombie, and it's terrible!

71
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:18,115
I have a condition where every time
I sense a shift in power dynamics,

72
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,658
I have a tiny orgasm!

73
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,327
I have no original ideas, I
just repeat things I hear.

74
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:24,663
- I've never been in love!
- I've never been in love!

75
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,540
I tried gay at theater camp!

76
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:29,835
I regret everything!

77
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,755
Whoa!

79
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:39,196
Hello?

80
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,576
Is anyone getting any bars?
I'm not getting any baa-rs.

81
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:48,413
Can someone validate my valet ticket?
I would like to go home now.

82
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,001
There's no way out. Okay.
Everybody stay sane.

83
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,253
I propose we set each
other on fire for warmth.

84
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:57,881
Who wants to be set on fire first?
Not me, I'm Jessica Biel.

85
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,257
Yeah, that's right.

86
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:00,661
The natives are getting restless,

87
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,386
so why don't you say
something to comfort them?

88
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,722
Okay. Everyone, remain calm!

89
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,600
No one's going to light anyone on fire.

90
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,443
For one thing, that'd
eat up a lot of oxygen

91
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,145
and who knows how much
we have down here.

92
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:14,898
- I want oxygen!
- Air! I need air!

93
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,068
God.

94
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,153
- You okay, sweetie?
- I think so.

95
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,155
- That was really scary.
- Yeah.

96
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,199
At least we know no one
is specifically at fault.

97
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:25,784
Well, except for San Andreas.

98
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,954
This was because you
fracked under our house.

99
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:32,040
I told you fracking was
dangerous, and you didn't listen.

100
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:35,752
And now our house is ruined and
we're trapped underground,

101
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,629
and we're all going to die!

102
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:42,217
- Is this one of our sexy fights?
- No!

103
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,176
Hmm.

104
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,473
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

105
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:51,518
You can be mad at me or get drunk
with me, but you can't do both.

106
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:53,102
Watch me.

107
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,941
Oh, what the shit?

108
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:04,531
- Oh, fish.
- Uh... hello?

109
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,285
- What are you doing in there?
- Uh, I live here.

110
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,453
Didn't you know there was
a huge party going on?

111
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,831
I was going to go to the
party after my bath,

112
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:16,293
but then I realized the
bath was the party.

113
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,211
Oh, God.

114
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,964
Well, I'm not waiting around
to be rescued like some chump.

115
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,299
Come on, let's go.

116
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,219
Whoa...!

117
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:32,017
- We gotta go in there?
- Well, I don't see any other way.

118
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,978
Sometimes life is like the second
season of Friday Night Lights...

119
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,856
You gotta push through and hope
there's better stuff ahead.

120
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,107
Aw-ww!

121
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:46,197
Guys, let's all try to just stay cool
and make the best of things, huh?

122
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:49,784
"Make the best of things"? You idiot,
we're trapped and we're terrified.

123
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:52,621
Okay, settle down, you future
hard Jeopardy question.

124
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,623
Let's hear what the idiot has to say.

125
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,833
So that's a re-up on the idiot part?

126
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,169
How are we supposed to
make the best of things?

127
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,372
- We're stuck underground.
- This is true.

128
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,169
But most of us are
important celebrities,

129
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:06,165
so someone will come for us soon.

130
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,970
And for you regulars, I'm sure
they'll bring you up with us!

131
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:10,347
What do we do till then?

132
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,767
We're actors! I say we put on a show.
Who's with me?

133
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,394
A show? Who will be the star?
Me, I assume.

134
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,855
Sure you'll be the star,
and you'll be the star!

135
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:21,983
And you'll be the star!
We'll all be the star!

136
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:25,779
Folks, I promise you we will
be out of here in no time.

137
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,533
And that's when I realized...

138
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,620
I just don't have the face for bangs.

139
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,665
Oh, my God, thank you so much.
You're too kind! Thank you.

140
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:40,961
Thank you, Phoebe, for that rousing
Tale from the Above Ground. Who's next?

141
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:42,963
I can't take this anymore.
I need to get out.

142
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:45,090
This is the longest I've
gone without moisturizing,

143
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,800
- and I feel like a lizard!
- Humph.

144
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,927
- No offense.
- It's only been 72 hours.

145
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,305
I'm missing my general meeting at CBS.
I'm supposed to get baa-ck to work.

146
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,709
I can't live like this! We've
gotta light someone on fire.

147
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:58,395
I'm starting to think that less-famous
Michelle Monaghan has the right idea

148
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,313
- about lighting people on fire.
- Thank you.

149
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:03,692
Come on, party people, keep it together.
Let's not forget why we're here...

150
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:05,527
To raise money for my campaign,

151
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,989
and more recently, to not go
crazy and murder each other.

152
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:13,952
Can someone please bring me my car?
It's a Prius. A silver Prius.

153
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,787
You're killing me, Zach.

154
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,164
Mr. Peanutbutter, you can do this.

155
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,250
Be the leader that I know you can be.

156
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,794
Yeah. You're right.
I've totally got this.

157
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,212
What in the world?

158
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:27,757
"Vox clamantis in deserto."

159
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,260
- It is I.
- Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz!

160
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,469
- We're saved!
- Wow!

161
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:32,679
Oh, thank God. A leader.

162
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:33,962
Sh.

163
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,683
What's going on down here?
Anyone's looking for us?

164
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,768
We're cool. Just being
cool, don't worry.

165
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:42,147
Diane, have you just been getting
drunk with BoJack this whole time?

166
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,150
What? I'm still mad at you.

167
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,986
- Citizens, remain calm.
- Yeah, that's what I've been saying!

168
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,572
Rescue workers are coming
but it could be a while.

169
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:53,533
State emergency funds have been
depleted due to budget overruns

170
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,828
on a costly bridge to Hawaii
that's being constructed.

171
00:08:56,853 --> 00:08:57,893
Oh, yeah!

172
00:08:57,918 --> 00:09:00,832
Since a woodchuck is a digging
animal, I came to get you out early.

173
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:05,170
Is that what a woodchuck is? Why
did I think it was like a beaver?

174
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,813
What's it like out there, Woodchuck?
Whole neighborhood totaled?

175
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,592
- Is the city in chaos?
- No, it's really just your house.

176
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:14,262
Because of all the fracking that's
been happening underneath your house.

177
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,723
Oh! Interesting!

178
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,266
- Ay-yi-yi.
- Oh, right, right.

179
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:23,229
So you just burrowed down here to rescue
your political opponent's top donors.

180
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:24,355
That's convenient.

181
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,441
It was actually very inconvenient,

182
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:30,528
but I put politics aside to
save you people from dying.

183
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:32,405
Three cheers for Woodchuck!

184
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:33,573
Hip, hip, hooray!

185
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,326
Please, don't cheer too loudly.
The tunnel is very delicate.

186
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,609
- Hip, hip, hooray!
- Seriously, I think it's best to...

187
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,288
Hip, hip, hooray!

188
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,606
- Let's cheer one more time,

189
00:09:45,653 --> 00:09:46,778
- just for fun!
- No, please.

190
00:09:46,825 --> 00:09:49,631
- Four cheers. Why not? Hip, hip...
- Hooray!

191
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,132
No!

192
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:59,599
So turns out three cheers was probably
an adequate number of cheers.

193
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,149
- What was that?
- Just keep walking.

194
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:09,567
God, I can't wait to get home.

195
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:11,236
I don't even have a home anymore.

196
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:15,615
Oh, man, where am I going to keep all
my different colored hats I never wear?

197
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,576
Well, if you need another couch to
crash on, there's always my place.

198
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,455
- Didn't you move in with Ralph?
- Yeah, but I kept the old apartment.

199
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:25,166
- Just in case, I guess.
- In case of what?

200
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,690
What was that?

201
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,378
Whoa!

202
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,130
Oh!

203
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,969
Now, ladies, just calm down.
We can talk about this.

204
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,064
What are we gonna do, Princess Carolyn?

205
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:44,394
Did you say you're a princess?

206
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,230
- That's just my name. I'm a manager.
- It's like an agent.

207
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,440
- It's totally different.
- Is it, though?

208
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:53,444
- Silence! You negotiate deals?
- Mm-hmm.

209
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:57,699
You could be of service,
Manager Carolyn.

210
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,539
My hands... they're crushed.

211
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,583
There's no way I can
dig us back out now.

212
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,750
Well, I can dig!

213
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,878
Actually, no one should dig.

214
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:12,130
Your foundation is
basically Swiss cheese.

215
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,697
The slightest provocation,

216
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:15,879
could cause another collapse
that would crush us all.

217
00:11:16,728 --> 00:11:20,305
I know that because I bought a sitcom
about fracking, The Frack Shack.

218
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:23,057
It's New Girl meets fracking.

219
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,351
Oh, God, no one's gonna
watch that show, huh?

220
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:30,315
Someone will be coming for us soon.
In the meantime, we must organize.

221
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,734
Parcel out food and water
and see how much we've got.

222
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:36,404
- I'll assign team leaders.
- Oh, no. I'm sensing a shift in power.

223
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:43,661
All right. Um...

224
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,372
- God...!
- For you, a banana

225
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:49,083
- because you're so appealing.
- Yeah.

226
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,085
And for you, a radish. Enjoy.

227
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:52,879
Mr. Peanutbutter, this is a disaster.

228
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:56,341
I don't think so. I'm food
captain, and I am loving it.

229
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,468
- And who made you the food captain?
- Woodchuck.

230
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,637
Exactly. He's in charge.

231
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,556
Excuse me, you have not been
allocated those rations.

232
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,226
I'm a horse. I need more
food, and I'm a celebrity.

233
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,979
- Everyone down here is a celebrity.
- Not the caterers.

234
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,564
Relinquish the food.

235
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,066
Hey. Here's your chance.

236
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:18,905
Actually, Woodchuck, this is my house
and BoJack can eat whatever he wants.

237
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:22,033
This man has already reached his
allotted food portion for the day.

238
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,868
Who said we have to go by your rules?

239
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:26,329
Yeah, who made you
leader of underground?

240
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,039
I'm just gonna take all this and...

241
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,541
You've appointed me. Yes, I under...
citizens, look...

242
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,919
Keep it together.

243
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,339
Weird stuff going on downstairs.

244
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,590
Humph.

245
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:40,551
- I can't believe this is my life.
- Uh-oh.

246
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:43,137
Too much sad booze for you.
Where's the happy booze?

247
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:46,224
I'm trapped underground and
it's all my husband's fault

248
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:51,270
and I'm gonna die in this mansion
in a mass grave with his ex-wives.

249
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:53,815
Okay. But on the bright side...

250
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:58,194
Look, Mr. Peanutbutter loves you, you
got a cool job, you got friends.

251
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,779
Jesus, you're right.

252
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:03,074
Even when I was above
ground, I wasn't satisfied.

253
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:06,244
Oh, my God. I'm the problem!

254
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,207
Whoa!

255
00:13:11,232 --> 00:13:12,305
What the...?

256
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,546
Why can't I be happy? Am I busted?

257
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,922
No. It...

258
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:20,675
I am! I'm a pit.

259
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:24,554
I'm a pit that good things fall into!

260
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:25,972
Diane, you're not a pit.

261
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:29,100
I'm a pit!

262
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:37,025
I can't believe I'm crying.
This is so dumb.

263
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:39,861
It's okay. Don't feel
bad about feeling bad.

264
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,572
You disappeared for a year and a half.

265
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,495
So you do want to talk about it. Just
took four solid days of drinking.

266
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:48,828
If you were back in L.A.,
why didn't you call me?

267
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:52,415
- I wasn't... ready.
- Ready? For what?

268
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,043
I wanted to be better
when you saw me again.

269
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:58,129
And I thought I could be, somehow.
But I'm not.

270
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:01,174
And even if I did get better,
the best I could ever be

271
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:04,761
is still just some other version of me.

272
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:08,681
BoJack, I can't wait
for you to be better.

273
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,767
I need you in my life.

274
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,478
- Really?
- You're the biggest asshole I know,

275
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,105
and you're the only thing
that makes sense to me.

276
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:23,946
People should be able to have some
control over their lives down here.

277
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,907
- Yeah!
- People need boundaries.

278
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,242
Leadership means sometimes
being the bad guy.

279
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:30,995
You hear that? Woodchuck's a bad guy!

280
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,789
I don't want a bad guy to be our leader.

281
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,992
- That's not...
- That's a point for Mr. Peanutbutter.

282
00:14:35,016 --> 00:14:37,502
And I'm the good guy, so
that's two points for me.

283
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,087
What points? There are no points.

284
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,923
- This is not a game!
- Well, maybe there should be points.

285
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,216
- Yeah!
- Points!

286
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,844
People seem to like my points idea.
That's another point for me.

287
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:49,764
Well, I'm the one who came down here
to save you in the first place.

288
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,349
Surely I get points for that.

289
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:54,497
Asking for points is conceited.
That's more points for me.

290
00:14:54,536 --> 00:14:55,716
- He's right!
- What?!

291
00:14:55,755 --> 00:14:57,814
If you came down to save
us, why are we still here?

292
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:58,897
Yeah!

293
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,566
You had one job, and you couldn't do it!

294
00:15:00,591 --> 00:15:01,687
- Yeah!
- That's right.

295
00:15:01,712 --> 00:15:02,860
Minus point for Woodchuck.

296
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:06,072
I implore you not to fall
into a mob mentality.

297
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,825
- He called us a mob! Let's kill him!
- Yeah!

298
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:12,537
Folks, Woodchuck's political
philosophy is as broken as his hands.

299
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,289
That is a convincing argument.
He does have broken hands.

300
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:18,626
Maybe it's time an
outsider took control.

301
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:22,672
An outsider like me, the
guy whose house this is.

302
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,258
Peanutbutter, Peanutbutter.

303
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,676
Peanutbutter... everybody.

304
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,137
Peanutbutter! Peanutbutter!

305
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,221
Peanutbutter!

306
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,389
- Me!
- Peanutbutter!

307
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,807
- Me!
- Peanutbutter!

308
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,851
Peanutbutter! Peanutbutter...

309
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,936
BoJack. BoJack.

310
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,104
- BoJack.
- What?

311
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,398
- Did you know I can juggle?
- Cool.

312
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,693
Are you okay? I mean, outside
of our current situation

313
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,862
of being buried alive and
almost out of alcohol

314
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,947
except for cooking sherry and Midori?

315
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,534
It's just been a rough couple years
with Sarah Lynn dying and Herb.

316
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,202
- And Corduroy?
- Cordu-what now?

317
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:58,332
Corduroy? Jackson-Jackson? Died
of autoerotic "asphyx-ization"?

318
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,918
Oh, yeah, him too. And now I got this...

319
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:05,006
girl in my house, this... daughter-type.

320
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,258
You got daughter? Ruh-roh.

321
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,635
Yeah, I got daughter, "ruh-roh."

322
00:16:09,697 --> 00:16:11,697
Supposed to help her figure
out who her mother is.

323
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,001
But I don't know where to start.

324
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:16,434
Did she try sending mutual consent
form to the adoption agency?

325
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,643
What, what words?

326
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:21,355
Well, if it's closed adoption,
you send a mutual consent form.

327
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:23,816
Basically says, "I wanna be open now!"

328
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:28,446
If Mom says same thing, boom-bah-boo!
Smo-pen Sesame!

329
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,073
- How do you know about that?
- I had an adopted brother.

330
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,367
And also for a while, I
hoped I was adopted.

331
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:35,369
- Ugh!
- Huh.

332
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,623
- Whoa!
- Ooh!

333
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,960
Who dares disturb Queen Antonia?

334
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:44,378
My name is Princess Carolyn.

335
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:47,465
I represent the soldiers
of Subcolony K-147,

336
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:50,801
who feel they're doing all the work
while reaping none of the spoils.

337
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:54,597
Everything my soldiers
do benefits the colony.

338
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,183
I had this same conversation
with Jeffrey Katzenberg.

339
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,268
Believe me, this doesn't
end well for you.

340
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,103
What are your demands?

341
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:05,191
They want to have sex with your drones.

342
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,109
My drones?

343
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,112
Mm-hmm.

344
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,448
Oliver, assemble the small council.

345
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:16,160
Uh, If we're gonna be down here
a while, can I get a new towel?

346
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,457
Woodchuck's aa-always
telling us what to do!

347
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,585
He says help is coming, but how
does he know? What if he's lying?

348
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:27,547
And I have still not been validated!

349
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,131
If you could all be patient...

350
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,634
We're sick of waiting! It's
time for new leadership.

351
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,344
That attempted movie star is right!

352
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:37,297
I declare Mr. Peanutbutter
President-for-life of Underground.

353
00:17:37,328 --> 00:17:38,437
Yeah!

354
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,934
Uh, uh, oh!

355
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,394
- Thank you!
- What? No!

356
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:44,105
- What do we do with Woodchuck?
- He must be made an example of.

357
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,273
- Get him!
- Yeah!

358
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:47,358
All right, guys, all right. Calm down.

359
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:50,653
We don't need to "get him."
Let's just tie him up someplace

360
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,072
where he can't hurt us anymore
with his dangerous ideas.

361
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:57,368
Do not tie me up. That isn't necessary.
No, don't... no...!

362
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,703
- Peanutbutter!
- No!

363
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:01,330
- Peanutbutter!
- Thank you, thank you all.

364
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:05,376
As my first act as President-for-life,
I declare that everyone

365
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:08,296
is allowed to eat and
drink whatever they want!

366
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:09,755
Yeah!

367
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,387
Agh...!

368
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:17,888
I'm starving,

369
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:20,516
and not the normal celebrity kind
of starving like I always am.

370
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,018
Or even red-carpet-season starving.

371
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,437
- Where's the food?
- You ate all the food.

372
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:26,790
This is it!

373
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:29,900
Nobody's coming for us. We
need to kill someone for food.

374
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,944
- Hmm...!
- Oh...!

375
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:33,404
Let's eat Mr. Peanutbutter!

376
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,740
He has the word "peanut
butter" in his name!

377
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:36,823
Yeah!

378
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:40,244
Guys, guys, guys, maybe we
don't need to eat anybody!

379
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:41,829
What's this now?

380
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,952
Let's listen to the guy
who's saying don't kill me.

381
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:45,499
He's got some interesting ideas.

382
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,126
Listen to me, everyone. Please.

383
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:50,379
I'm known for monologues that sum
things up at the end of the show.

384
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,798
I drive a Prius, which
means I'm a good person.

385
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:55,635
Let's not surrender to
our basest instincts.

386
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:58,721
I know times are tough, but
I'm sure if we band together

387
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,973
and really concentrate
on the problem at hand,

388
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:03,225
we can, as a group of friends...

389
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,063
- Oh, my God.
- Biel!

390
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:11,359
The rule of man is over. Now
begins the rule of fire.

391
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:14,070
- Oh, why?
- Jessica, no.

392
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,488
I will no longer be shackled

393
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:18,115
by the civilized society
of the above ground.

394
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:21,869
This is Underground, and the
only law here is flame.

395
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:25,915
The fire wants not for justice.
The fire wants not for reason.

396
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:29,669
- The fire desires only to be fed!
- Feed the fire!

397
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,880
- The fire is my new god!
- Oh, God!

398
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,716
I'm so sorry, Mr. Peanutbutter,
but the tide has turned

399
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,677
and I side with the fire now.

400
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,179
Tonight, we dine on Zach Braff.

401
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:43,182
- Tomorrow, canine cuisine!
- No.

402
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,226
You, take him to his
spot, and make him stay.

403
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,811
No! No! Please!

404
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,938
Listen to reason... this time!

405
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:52,066
Ah-hh!

406
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,317
I think that's all of it.

407
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:56,529
I can't go back to my old life sober.
It's so empty.

408
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,948
Okay, okay. Here's the
secret to being happy.

409
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,700
Oh, I can't wait to hear this.

410
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:02,540
Just pretend you are happy,

411
00:20:02,689 --> 00:20:04,644
and eventually you'll
forget you're pretending.

412
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:05,746
Maybe you're right.

413
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,791
I just need to stop
complaining and work harder.

414
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,544
Everyone else is doing it.
Why am I so special?

415
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,379
Lock him in here!

416
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:16,689
- Please! Diane, my sweet wife.
- What's going on?

417
00:20:16,714 --> 00:20:17,734
Marvin Gaye.

418
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:20,219
The People of Underground
have a new god, the fire.

419
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:23,139
And for my crimes I will be
fed to its ravenous flames.

420
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,975
My only hope is the meat of
Zach Braff proves lasting,

421
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,894
but I fear by daybreak, there
will be no Braff meat left.

422
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,939
- What's going on?
- Four Non-Blondes.

423
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,399
Everybody out except the prisoner.

424
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,042
- No!
- Easy on the merchandise!

425
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:36,110
Get off me!

426
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:41,031
Well, it's been a tough week,
lots of back and forth,

427
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:44,201
but I think we've reached an agreement
that meets everybody's needs.

428
00:20:44,235 --> 00:20:46,555
"The queen will share male sex
servants with the soldiers"

429
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,622
for one night of magnificent,
sensuous splendor,

430
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:50,499
a gorgeous bacchanal of
hedonistic delights,

431
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,669
"with a second orgy pickup option,
pursuant on success of the first."

432
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,964
My clients are satisfied
with those terms.

433
00:20:57,047 --> 00:21:00,134
Great. Now can we please
return to the surface world?

434
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,678
All my favorite clouds are up there.

435
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:07,141
Oh, I like this one. He's got
moxie and a soft thorax.

436
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:11,645
How did you find your fleshy self in
my kingdom, you pink marshmallow?

437
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:14,190
We were at this big
Beverly Hills fundraiser.

438
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:17,610
There was an earthquake, and now
everyone's trapped underground.

439
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,696
Did you say Beverly Hills?
Ugh! Of course.

440
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,365
Surface dwellers are always
moving in on our territory.

441
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:26,285
First they move here, then taxes go up,

442
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,579
the next thing you know,
there's a Whole Foods.

443
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,915
How am I supposed to
concentrate on a great orgy

444
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,958
when I've got gentrification on my mind?

445
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:35,878
No, we've got to get those
interlopers out of here.

446
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,047
- Let's...
- Hey! Hold on.

447
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,012
- Uh...
- Mr. Peanutbutter,

448
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:48,474
did you or did you not tell us
we could eat whatever we wanted?

449
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:49,683
Peanutbutter!

450
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:52,645
Peanutbutter! Peanutbutter!
Peanutbutter!

451
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:53,979
We gotta do something.

452
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:57,066
Mr. Peanutbutter's the only non-shitty
thing that's ever happened to me

453
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,901
and now they're gonna set him on fire.

454
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,487
Okay. What would non-hungover Diane do?
She's smart.

455
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,405
I don't know. I need water.

456
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,991
There is no more water.
That's the problem.

457
00:22:06,016 --> 00:22:07,106
"Choodwuck" is right.

458
00:22:07,145 --> 00:22:11,497
Wait, isn't there water, under
the ground? Like, a well?

459
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,960
- Yeah! And we're underground.
- If we dig, we'll get water!

460
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,113
Do not dig. The ground is very volatile.

461
00:22:18,168 --> 00:22:20,261
Quiet, sky rodent! To the shovels!

462
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,051
Mr. Peanutbutter, your time is nigh.

463
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:27,054
Any last words before
we light you on fire?

464
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:31,058
Yes, if I could just say,
"Don't light me on fire"?

465
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:35,771
The fire bends to no man's will.
Nothing can defeat the fire. Only...

466
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:36,855
Water!

467
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,108
What?

468
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,570
- Oh, wow, it's really water.
- Water is stronger than fire.

469
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:44,863
Wait, let's not really
forget how... ugh!

470
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:46,407
Water is my new god now!

471
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,367
Oh, boy.

472
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,411
- Clear gold!
- All right, water!

473
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:54,248
H-2-Oh, boy, we hit
the freaking jackpot!

474
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,333
Hang on. It's... it's not stopping.

475
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,168
Which is great!

476
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:00,254
You hit a pipe, you drunken imbeciles.

477
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,047
H-2-Oh, no!

478
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,304
Well, I guess this is it.

479
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,974
Oh, God! It's another earthquake!

480
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,104
How is this happening?

481
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,774
Heave! Heave! Heave!

482
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:22,985
Get them out of here!

483
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,446
Okay.

484
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:28,282
No! Please! I'm important down here!

485
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:30,409
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

486
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:40,502
Oh, what an eyesore. The HOA
will be hearing about this.

487
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:47,843
We are never talking about any
of this ever again. Whew.

488
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,763
So I will see you tomorrow. We've
got a rally in Bakersfield

489
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,307
and then we're touring a tennis
ball factory in Modesto.

490
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,558
Okay.

491
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:57,227
- Hi.
- Hi.

492
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:59,229
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

493
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:01,357
- I don't tell you that enough.
- It's okay.

494
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:04,735
If this governor thing is
really important to you...

495
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:07,655
It's not. You saw me in there.
I'm a terrible leader.

496
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:10,324
I don't want to be governor. I
just wanted people to like me.

497
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:12,201
Well, I like you.

498
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:15,037
Come on, Diane, let's go home...

499
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,497
oh, right.

500
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,300
Well, thanks for inviting
me to your party.

501
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:21,251
I had a wonderful time.
Evening really flew by.

502
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:22,335
Sure.

503
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:28,037
- You guys hungry?
- I could eat.

504
00:24:28,062 --> 00:24:29,160
Ethiopian?

505
00:24:29,185 --> 00:24:31,077
Ooh, haven't done Ethiopian in a while.

506
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,972
I should go home. I haven't
seen my boyfriend in ten days.

507
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:35,349
He's probably worried about me.

508
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:38,936
I'm down for Ethiopian. I
love that sponge bread.

509
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,689
- What do they call it, "injera"?
- Yeah, injera.

510
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:44,108
- Injera, right.
- That's right.

511
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,652
Yeah, that's good bread.
