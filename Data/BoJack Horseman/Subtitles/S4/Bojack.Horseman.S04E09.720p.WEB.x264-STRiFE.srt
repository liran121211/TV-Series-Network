Not to speak above my station,

171
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,881
but perhaps it would
behoove us to entice

172
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,569
BoJack Horseman back into our stable.

173
00:07:18,575 --> 00:07:19,742
- Ugh!
- I'm sorry, ma'am.

174
00:07:19,748 --> 00:07:21,936
"Stable" and "behoove"
were poor word choices.

I was not trying to engage in
punnery during business hours,

BoJack is off the table.

We're a small management company.

Well, when you're ready to work again...

Gotta go. They need all hands on deck,

his hands underground

with creepy lobster claws.

Your approval means nothing to me.

So I guess it's good you said
"no" to my offer last year.

00:09:51,138 --> 00:09:52,606

Last year, I reached out to your guy...

I wanna say, "Ju-do"...

00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:04,521
- Judah.
- This guy's name was Judo.

244

I offered to buy VIM

00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:10,485
We would have called

Oh, right. That offer.

So I guess it all worked
out for everyone.

You got to start over as a manager,

I bought the Utah Jazz.
