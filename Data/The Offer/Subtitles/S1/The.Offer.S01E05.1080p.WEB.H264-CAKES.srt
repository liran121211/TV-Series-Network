1
00:00:01,912 --> 00:00:03,314
This picture is an assault

2
00:00:03,414 --> 00:00:05,116
on Italian Americans
everywhere.

3
00:00:05,216 --> 00:00:07,151
If I have my way, you won't
make this movie at all.

4
00:00:07,251 --> 00:00:09,253
"The Godfather"
is becoming a problem.

5
00:00:09,353 --> 00:00:10,421
We wanna give you
some help.

6
00:00:10,521 --> 00:00:11,555
No.

7
00:00:11,655 --> 00:00:13,124
One more thing.
Pacino.

8
00:00:13,224 --> 00:00:15,126
Give him another shot.
No Pacino.

9
00:00:15,226 --> 00:00:17,294
How many fucking times
do I have to tell you?

10
00:00:17,394 --> 00:00:19,430
I got a script
the size of an encyclopedia,

11
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,232
a director in love with
the shortest unknown actor

12
00:00:21,332 --> 00:00:22,533
on the fucking planet,

13
00:00:22,633 --> 00:00:24,235
and Biaggi's making waves.

14
00:00:24,335 --> 00:00:25,436
Am I forgetting anything?

15
00:00:25,536 --> 00:00:26,737
No.

16
00:00:26,837 --> 00:00:28,572
I'm pretty sure that covers it.

17
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:30,841
Joe Gallo's actions
led to our last war.

18
00:00:30,941 --> 00:00:33,177
If Gallo comes gunning
for Colombo,

19
00:00:33,277 --> 00:00:34,778
you get caught
with a stray bullet.

20
00:00:34,878 --> 00:00:36,513
What do you got
in mind for him?

21
00:00:36,613 --> 00:00:38,849
I'm gonna light his whole
fucking world on fire.

22
00:00:38,949 --> 00:00:41,418
It's you and me now.
Your enemies are my enemies.

23
00:00:41,518 --> 00:00:44,488
Please,
I don't want no trouble.

24
00:00:44,588 --> 00:00:46,657
The Marlon Brando's house.

25
00:00:46,757 --> 00:00:49,493
Ever since your letter,
I keep thinking about the Don.

26
00:00:49,593 --> 00:00:51,795
Pacino and Brando
in the same frame.

27
00:00:51,895 --> 00:00:52,696
I'm working on it.

28
00:00:52,796 --> 00:00:55,199
Side with Francis.
Pacino's the guy.

29
00:00:55,299 --> 00:00:56,833
Evans gave you your shot.

30
00:00:56,933 --> 00:00:58,735
If I say yes,
he's gonna be pissed.

31
00:00:58,835 --> 00:01:01,305
You stabbed me in the back.
I don't like Pacino!

32
00:01:01,405 --> 00:01:02,739
I want to be with you.

33
00:01:02,839 --> 00:01:05,209
All of you or none of you.

34
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:06,777
This is the life
that we've chosen.

35
00:01:06,877 --> 00:01:10,514
We can only be around other
people who understand that.

36
00:01:10,614 --> 00:01:12,149
You got the part, kid.

37
00:01:12,249 --> 00:01:13,784
I'm doing "The Gang That
Couldn't Shoot Straight."

38
00:01:13,884 --> 00:01:15,519
I signed a contract.

39
00:01:38,942 --> 00:01:40,211
What are you doing?
Come on.

40
00:01:40,311 --> 00:01:41,912
I like this song.
No.

41
00:01:42,012 --> 00:01:43,146
You're sending
the wrong message, kid.

42
00:01:43,247 --> 00:01:44,481
What fucking message?

43
00:01:45,849 --> 00:01:47,150
Here we go.

44
00:01:47,251 --> 00:01:49,186
That's good, no?

45
00:01:49,286 --> 00:01:50,554
Whatever, old man,
I like this too.

46
00:01:50,654 --> 00:01:52,623
Ah, fuck you
with the "old man."

47
00:01:56,527 --> 00:01:57,728
Would you look at this jamoke?

48
00:01:57,828 --> 00:02:00,664
The fuck?

49
00:02:00,764 --> 00:02:01,732
Fuck that.

50
00:02:01,832 --> 00:02:04,935
Come on!

51
00:02:05,035 --> 00:02:07,404
What the fuck is he doin'?

52
00:02:12,443 --> 00:02:14,211
Hey, buddy, you gotta move
this fuckin' car

53
00:02:14,311 --> 00:02:15,746
before I move it for you.

54
00:02:15,846 --> 00:02:16,880
Fuck.

55
00:02:22,753 --> 00:02:24,455
Let him go.

56
00:02:27,324 --> 00:02:28,525
What do you think's
in the truck?

57
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:30,461
Don't matter.

58
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,012
What the fuck
are you doing here?

59
00:04:29,112 --> 00:04:30,781
Oh, my God,
you smell like a sick dog.

60
00:04:30,881 --> 00:04:31,848
What the fuck?

61
00:04:31,948 --> 00:04:33,984
I just got off a plane.

62
00:04:34,084 --> 00:04:35,419
I need your help.

63
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:36,787
Boy, did you come
to the wrong place.

64
00:04:37,988 --> 00:04:39,423
You told me to do whatever
it takes to get my movie made.

65
00:04:39,523 --> 00:04:40,891
You said to color
outside the lines.

66
00:04:40,991 --> 00:04:43,994
I never told you
to fuck me over.

67
00:04:44,094 --> 00:04:45,529
That was never
my intention, Bob.

68
00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:47,364
Yeah,
and Yoko Ono never intended

69
00:04:47,464 --> 00:04:48,632
to break up The Beatles.

70
00:04:48,732 --> 00:04:50,967
I don't give a fuck
about your intentions.

71
00:04:51,067 --> 00:04:52,603
It was for the movie.

72
00:04:52,703 --> 00:04:54,438
It was for the good
of the movie.

73
00:04:54,538 --> 00:04:56,907
Keep saying that to yourself.

74
00:04:59,109 --> 00:05:00,343
Listen.

75
00:05:00,444 --> 00:05:01,378
Pacino can't do the film.

76
00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:03,046
He signed on
to another project.

77
00:05:03,146 --> 00:05:04,915
Problem solved then.

78
00:05:06,182 --> 00:05:07,718
I need you
to get him out of it.

79
00:05:09,586 --> 00:05:12,723
You have got to be
fucking kidding me.

80
00:05:12,823 --> 00:05:13,957
Come on, Bob.

81
00:05:14,057 --> 00:05:14,925
You've never even
given him a shot.

82
00:05:15,025 --> 00:05:16,092
He's got something special.

83
00:05:16,192 --> 00:05:17,394
We need him.

84
00:05:17,494 --> 00:05:20,531
What you need
is a fucking shower.

85
00:05:20,631 --> 00:05:21,798
Mush.

86
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:27,404
Now, Paramount is just
one asset among dozens

87
00:05:27,504 --> 00:05:29,473
in the Gulf and Western
portfolio.

88
00:05:29,573 --> 00:05:31,675
Now, by God's grace,

89
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:34,144
we have a record-breaking hit
called "Love Story,"

90
00:05:34,244 --> 00:05:36,480
but I won't pretend
that we knew

91
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,114
it was gonna hit like this.

92
00:05:38,214 --> 00:05:40,817
And that is actually my point.

93
00:05:40,917 --> 00:05:43,554
Making movies has become
too unpredictable.

94
00:05:43,654 --> 00:05:46,523
Hollywood was founded by men
who understood

95
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,892
that the bottom line
of making movies

96
00:05:48,992 --> 00:05:51,595
is to make money.

97
00:05:51,695 --> 00:05:54,865
But gentlemen,
that system is broken.

98
00:05:54,965 --> 00:05:58,469
The men with their hands
on the wheel now,

99
00:05:58,569 --> 00:06:00,704
they are, quite frankly,
bullshit artists

100
00:06:00,804 --> 00:06:04,007
who like to think of themselves
as the talent.

101
00:06:04,107 --> 00:06:05,776
They know exactly
what to say to us

102
00:06:05,876 --> 00:06:06,877
to get our money,

103
00:06:07,844 --> 00:06:09,012
but they can give a damn
about making it back

104
00:06:09,112 --> 00:06:12,449
because
they are not businessmen.

105
00:06:12,549 --> 00:06:15,151
Now that we have finally
had some success,

106
00:06:15,251 --> 00:06:16,720
we can get a much better price

107
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,923
if we offload Paramount now
and cash out.

108
00:06:20,023 --> 00:06:22,192
So that's why we're here today.

109
00:06:22,292 --> 00:06:24,628
We are here to seek
the board's approval

110
00:06:24,728 --> 00:06:28,799
to begin the exploration
process because

111
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:32,936
we have already
had four suitors interested.

112
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,907
Charlie, anything to add?

113
00:06:39,275 --> 00:06:40,711
Some of you think that

114
00:06:40,811 --> 00:06:43,880
I have a sentimental attachment
to Paramount.

115
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,583
I have a sentimental attachment
to many things,

116
00:06:46,683 --> 00:06:50,521
which is why when I sell them,

117
00:06:50,621 --> 00:06:53,590
I sell them for a lot of money.

118
00:07:05,736 --> 00:07:08,004
Tessio, he's gotta be older.

119
00:07:08,104 --> 00:07:12,008
He... he's like the oldest guy
in the whole family.

120
00:07:12,108 --> 00:07:13,476
So what you're saying
is you want Clemenza to be

121
00:07:13,577 --> 00:07:15,512
two or three years younger?

122
00:07:15,612 --> 00:07:18,882
Yeah, that'd be good.
You got anybody in mind?

123
00:07:18,982 --> 00:07:21,017
Hello.
Hi.

124
00:07:21,117 --> 00:07:22,586
Where's Ruddy?

125
00:07:22,686 --> 00:07:23,754
He's on his way back from LA.

126
00:07:23,854 --> 00:07:27,023
His flight lands later tonight.

127
00:07:27,123 --> 00:07:29,693
Why's he in LA?

128
00:07:29,793 --> 00:07:31,662
Doesn't he realize
that the producer

129
00:07:31,762 --> 00:07:33,797
is supposed to be here
for pre-production?

130
00:07:33,897 --> 00:07:37,067
We have a sit-down
with Tavoularis and Gordy.

131
00:07:37,167 --> 00:07:38,201
Did you tell him?

132
00:07:38,301 --> 00:07:39,736
I was waiting
until Ruddy got back.

133
00:07:39,836 --> 00:07:41,237
Tell me what?
What is wrong?

134
00:07:41,337 --> 00:07:43,907
Pacino signed a contract
for another movie.

135
00:07:47,177 --> 00:07:49,813
Come on, Francis.

136
00:07:49,913 --> 00:07:52,749
Jimmy Caan's screen test
was good and you know it.

137
00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:54,250
We just set him for Sonny.

138
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,920
And now you want me
to just make him Michael?

139
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,255
Francis, you know this shit
happens all the time.

140
00:07:59,355 --> 00:08:02,125
Andrea,
this isn't musical chairs.

141
00:08:02,225 --> 00:08:04,294
Caan is not even Italian.
Okay.

142
00:08:04,394 --> 00:08:07,564
You're making a movie
with Marlon Brando.

143
00:08:07,664 --> 00:08:10,300
And don't worry,
we'll find another Michael.

144
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,002
Will he just look
at Pacino?

145
00:08:19,175 --> 00:08:20,911
Roll it back, would you?

146
00:08:21,011 --> 00:08:22,946
Again?

147
00:08:23,046 --> 00:08:25,716
How many times do we have to
watch "Panic in Needle Park"?

148
00:08:25,816 --> 00:08:27,584
There's a scene in
"The Godfather" script,

149
00:08:27,684 --> 00:08:28,685
Michael tells his
brother-in-law

150
00:08:28,785 --> 00:08:30,320
he's not gonna kill him
but we know he's lying.

151
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,888
It's a shocking scene.

152
00:08:31,988 --> 00:08:33,857
But it's gotta be played
in the subtext.

153
00:08:33,957 --> 00:08:35,759
Pacino doesn't have
to say a word

154
00:08:35,859 --> 00:08:37,994
and I can't take
my eyes off him.

155
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:43,299
"An ice-blue, terrifying film

156
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:46,937
about people you love."

157
00:08:47,037 --> 00:08:49,640
Fuckin' Ruddy.

158
00:08:52,142 --> 00:08:54,678
Hi.
Hey, Bettye.

159
00:08:54,778 --> 00:08:56,079
Ooh, you smell nice.

160
00:08:56,179 --> 00:08:57,580
Fancy hotel, fancy soap.

161
00:08:57,681 --> 00:08:59,249
Gotta love the Waldorf.

162
00:08:59,349 --> 00:09:01,685
How'd it go with Evans?
What did he say?

163
00:09:01,785 --> 00:09:02,686
He said,
"Do whatever it takes

164
00:09:02,786 --> 00:09:05,221
to get your movie made, Ruddy.
I support you."

165
00:09:05,321 --> 00:09:07,991
So not well, I take it.

166
00:09:08,091 --> 00:09:09,960
Have you...

167
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,695
have you seen this?

168
00:09:13,163 --> 00:09:14,931
It's Carmine.

169
00:09:15,031 --> 00:09:17,267
Fuck.

170
00:09:17,367 --> 00:09:19,770
I liked that guy.

171
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,105
Al, this is really scary.

172
00:09:23,707 --> 00:09:24,775
We're gonna be okay.

173
00:09:30,146 --> 00:09:32,115
You got any good news for me?

174
00:09:32,215 --> 00:09:34,651
Well, your buddy Jack Ballard

175
00:09:34,751 --> 00:09:37,220
is waiting for you
in your office.

176
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,022
Shit.

177
00:09:39,122 --> 00:09:40,657
You and I are gonna
need to have a little chat

178
00:09:40,757 --> 00:09:42,726
about what exactly
constitutes good news.

179
00:09:45,762 --> 00:09:47,163
Just the man I want to see.

180
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,899
Jack,
what are you doing here?

181
00:09:48,999 --> 00:09:52,135
Anything you need,
Mr. Producer.

182
00:09:52,235 --> 00:09:54,871
Have you met our editor?
Aram Avakian, Al Ruddy.

183
00:09:54,971 --> 00:09:57,007
Aram, I thought you weren't
getting in until tomorrow.

184
00:09:57,107 --> 00:09:58,108
Uh, Jack called me.

185
00:09:59,075 --> 00:10:00,243
He wanted to get acquainted
a day earlier.

186
00:10:00,343 --> 00:10:02,645
Oh, did he?
Mm.

187
00:10:02,746 --> 00:10:04,915
Glad to be aboard.
Glad to have you.

188
00:10:05,015 --> 00:10:06,649
Jack, did you see
"The Miracle Worker"?

189
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,118
Nah, missed it.
Aram cut it.

190
00:10:08,218 --> 00:10:09,185
It's beautiful work.

191
00:10:09,285 --> 00:10:10,787
Mm, thank you.

192
00:10:10,887 --> 00:10:13,656
Al's gonna need a miracle
to bring us in on budget.

193
00:10:13,757 --> 00:10:15,125
Aram, tell you what.

194
00:10:15,225 --> 00:10:16,760
We'll have a drink,
take each other's temperature,

195
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,661
and solve the world's problems.
Sounds good to me.

196
00:10:18,762 --> 00:10:20,363
Where and when?
Count me in.

197
00:10:20,463 --> 00:10:21,865
For the second round, Jack.

198
00:10:21,965 --> 00:10:23,233
I like to meet the team
on my own first.

199
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:24,968
Oh, sorry.
I wasn't sure about that

200
00:10:25,068 --> 00:10:26,669
since you missed the meeting
with your production designer

201
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:29,105
and cinematographer
this morning.

202
00:10:32,308 --> 00:10:34,711
Looking forward to that drink.

203
00:10:34,811 --> 00:10:35,979
Charlie.

204
00:10:42,352 --> 00:10:46,389
Question: why is Jim Aubrey
seated at my regular my booth?

205
00:10:46,489 --> 00:10:48,258
I'm so sorry, Mr. Evans.

206
00:10:48,358 --> 00:10:49,692
Mr. Aubrey got here early.

207
00:10:49,793 --> 00:10:51,895
He insisted on sitting
at his usual table.

208
00:10:51,995 --> 00:10:54,030
Aubrey runs MGM.
I run Paramount.

209
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:55,799
MGM just had an auction
to sell off

210
00:10:55,899 --> 00:10:57,300
props and costumes
to pay the mortgage.

211
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,701
Come on.

212
00:10:58,802 --> 00:10:59,569
How long has he been here?

213
00:10:59,669 --> 00:11:01,872
About six minutes.
Son of a bitch.

214
00:11:01,972 --> 00:11:05,141
You couldn't stall him for
six minutes until I got here?

215
00:11:05,241 --> 00:11:08,111
Coffee.

216
00:11:08,211 --> 00:11:09,312
Please.

217
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:13,449
Terry, looking good.
You lost weight?

218
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:15,318
Hi, Bob.
How are you?

219
00:11:15,418 --> 00:11:16,386
Anabelle.

220
00:11:16,486 --> 00:11:18,021
Hi, Bob.
Hi, dear.

221
00:11:18,121 --> 00:11:19,756
Nice to see you.
Catch up later.

222
00:11:19,856 --> 00:11:21,758
Jim, I'm so sorry I'm late.
You're still early.

223
00:11:21,858 --> 00:11:22,859
Well, I grew up under the rule

224
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:23,894
that if you're
ten minutes early,

225
00:11:23,994 --> 00:11:27,430
you're still late.

226
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,465
Hell of a job
you're doing at MGM.

227
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:31,802
It's all anyone can talk about.

228
00:11:31,902 --> 00:11:32,936
Last year, we were in the red.

229
00:11:33,036 --> 00:11:34,838
This year we're seeing
nothing but black.

230
00:11:34,938 --> 00:11:36,773
How 'bout you?
Well, we haven't started

231
00:11:36,873 --> 00:11:38,975
selling our props
and furniture just yet.

232
00:11:39,075 --> 00:11:40,210
Nothing's too precious, huh?

233
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,445
Not even Dorothy's
Ruby Red slippers?

234
00:11:42,545 --> 00:11:44,014
Thank you.

235
00:11:44,114 --> 00:11:46,516
So we got a small piece
of business between us.

236
00:11:46,616 --> 00:11:47,884
Let's make sure
we're on the same page.

237
00:11:47,984 --> 00:11:49,285
This is about swapping actors.

238
00:11:49,385 --> 00:11:50,753
It's Pacino and De Niro.

239
00:11:50,854 --> 00:11:52,122
Two guys starting out
their careers,

240
00:11:52,222 --> 00:11:54,024
getting paid scale plus ten.
Come on.

241
00:11:54,124 --> 00:11:55,525
You're treating them like
we're trading an outfielder

242
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,527
for a shortstop.
Why not?

243
00:11:57,627 --> 00:11:58,761
It's for the good
of both movies.

244
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:01,865
Each wants the other's part.
Simple.

245
00:12:01,965 --> 00:12:04,534
You know, you make fun
of the MGM yard sale,

246
00:12:04,634 --> 00:12:08,204
but I hear that Paramount's
getting spun off.

247
00:12:08,304 --> 00:12:09,272
The whole show.

248
00:12:09,372 --> 00:12:10,506
Gulf and Western
is getting tired

249
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:12,342
and they want out.

250
00:12:17,013 --> 00:12:17,848
No.

251
00:12:17,948 --> 00:12:19,449
If you didn't know,
I just did you a favor

252
00:12:19,549 --> 00:12:23,987
and that's on top of the favor
you're here to ask me for.

253
00:12:24,087 --> 00:12:25,822
I think I've done
both of us a favor.

254
00:12:25,922 --> 00:12:27,790
You want this more than I do.

255
00:12:27,891 --> 00:12:29,792
Personally,
I don't see such a difference

256
00:12:29,893 --> 00:12:31,294
between Pacino and De Niro.

257
00:12:31,394 --> 00:12:33,796
De Niro does "The Gang
That Couldn't Shoot Straight."

258
00:12:33,897 --> 00:12:36,332
Pacino does "The Godfather."
Everybody wins.

259
00:12:36,432 --> 00:12:39,069
Pass.
What else?

260
00:12:41,071 --> 00:12:43,806
You have a couple of
Harold Robbins' books I want.

261
00:12:43,907 --> 00:12:45,341
Can't do it.

262
00:12:45,441 --> 00:12:47,243
Then we don't have a deal.

263
00:12:53,549 --> 00:12:55,886
One book.

264
00:12:55,986 --> 00:12:58,354
One book, my choice.

265
00:13:11,101 --> 00:13:12,435
Wow.

266
00:13:12,535 --> 00:13:14,470
That had to hurt.

267
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:19,075
You sure this is
really worth it?

268
00:13:19,175 --> 00:13:20,944
You know, I'm a production
designer, not a magician.

269
00:13:21,044 --> 00:13:22,478
Dean, what's the problem?

270
00:13:22,578 --> 00:13:24,047
Well, having permits
to build sets

271
00:13:24,147 --> 00:13:26,382
where I'm supposed to
build them would be nice.

272
00:13:26,482 --> 00:13:28,218
We have permits.
They got pulled.

273
00:13:28,318 --> 00:13:30,887
Some congressmen
is fucking with us.

274
00:13:30,987 --> 00:13:33,056
Look, this should have been
handled a long time ago.

275
00:13:33,156 --> 00:13:35,225
Take it easy, okay?
It's a misunderstanding.

276
00:13:35,325 --> 00:13:37,560
Bettye, call that kid
in the film office I talked to.

277
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,330
Kevin something.
Yeah.

278
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:42,899
He'll sort this out.

279
00:13:45,035 --> 00:13:48,338
Hi, I have Al Ruddy
on the line for Kevin, please.

280
00:13:50,606 --> 00:13:52,976
Since when?

281
00:13:53,076 --> 00:13:56,379
Okay. Thank you.

282
00:13:56,479 --> 00:13:57,981
Kevin's been fired.

283
00:13:59,615 --> 00:14:02,485
Because he gave us the permits.

284
00:14:03,286 --> 00:14:05,521
We need to take Gallo out now.

285
00:14:05,621 --> 00:14:09,192
No. No, not yet.

286
00:14:09,292 --> 00:14:11,227
I gotta talk to Carlo
and the rest of the Commission

287
00:14:11,327 --> 00:14:14,664
to get the okay to rip
this motherfucker's face off.

288
00:14:14,764 --> 00:14:16,499
All right, in the meantime,

289
00:14:16,599 --> 00:14:18,401
hit the streets,
make your collections.

290
00:14:18,501 --> 00:14:19,669
Everybody pays today.

291
00:14:19,769 --> 00:14:22,638
I want 20% kickback
to Carmine's widow.

292
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:24,975
FBI. Nobody move!

293
00:14:25,075 --> 00:14:27,610
Keep your hands
where we can see 'em.

294
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,012
Well, this is nice.

295
00:14:29,112 --> 00:14:31,347
Family reunion.
You bring presents?

296
00:14:31,447 --> 00:14:32,949
We got warrants.
You know the drill.

297
00:14:33,049 --> 00:14:34,284
Okay, okay.

298
00:14:34,384 --> 00:14:36,552
Tear this place up.

299
00:14:40,123 --> 00:14:41,657
What's this?
Go fuck yourself.

300
00:14:43,193 --> 00:14:44,594
Teach your people
some respect.

301
00:14:44,694 --> 00:14:46,329
I need that.

302
00:14:47,297 --> 00:14:50,500
Congressman Biaggi
sends his best.

303
00:15:11,754 --> 00:15:13,689
Hello?
Listen to me.

304
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:15,291
You're still a putz,

305
00:15:15,391 --> 00:15:16,959
but I got Pacino.

306
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,495
He's in the picture.

307
00:15:19,595 --> 00:15:22,498
Oh, Bob, thank you.
I can't tell you how much...

308
00:15:22,598 --> 00:15:24,200
They can't breathe.
Huh?

309
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,369
The leaves.
Look, they're turning brown.

310
00:15:32,308 --> 00:15:34,544
See? Caravaggio has the
light coming in from the top

311
00:15:34,644 --> 00:15:36,146
and stopping on the edges.

312
00:15:36,246 --> 00:15:37,480
I know. I love it.
It's beautiful.

313
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,648
I love the shadows.

314
00:15:38,748 --> 00:15:40,250
It doesn't give the actors
much leeway

315
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,352
to move around though.
That's right.

316
00:15:42,452 --> 00:15:44,254
Well, they have to have
freedom to move.

317
00:15:44,354 --> 00:15:46,122
Well, they have
to hit their marks.

318
00:15:46,222 --> 00:15:49,125
They need to be free to move
so we're gonna test it.

319
00:15:50,726 --> 00:15:52,562
Sure. Yeah, if you want.

320
00:15:52,662 --> 00:15:54,764
It's not an insult, Gordy,
to work all this out

321
00:15:54,864 --> 00:15:56,199
before we get on the set
with 100 people.

322
00:15:56,299 --> 00:15:57,700
You wanna test?
We'll test. It's fine.

323
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,369
It's fine.
Good. Great.

324
00:15:59,469 --> 00:16:01,404
See it as an opportunity
to show off.

325
00:16:01,504 --> 00:16:03,173
What? Is that what you think
that I'm doing here?

326
00:16:03,273 --> 00:16:04,240
Uh-oh.

327
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,176
Are Mom and Dad fighting again?

328
00:16:06,276 --> 00:16:07,477
Hello.

329
00:16:07,577 --> 00:16:09,145
Can you give us a minute
because we're working...

330
00:16:09,245 --> 00:16:11,747
Yeah, sure.
I just came by

331
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:14,084
because I had
a little piece of news,

332
00:16:14,184 --> 00:16:16,018
a very small piece
of news to deliver...

333
00:16:16,119 --> 00:16:17,153
Ruddy, what?

334
00:16:17,253 --> 00:16:19,655
And I wanted to do it
in person.

335
00:16:19,755 --> 00:16:22,225
No. You got Pacino?

336
00:16:22,325 --> 00:16:23,493
You got him!

337
00:16:23,593 --> 00:16:25,128
Are you kidding?

338
00:16:25,228 --> 00:16:26,696
You did it?
How did you do it?

339
00:16:26,796 --> 00:16:29,265
There's a certain shade
of yellow

340
00:16:29,365 --> 00:16:31,201
and we're not making
this movie without it.

341
00:16:31,301 --> 00:16:32,235
Oh.

342
00:16:33,103 --> 00:16:33,503
Do I want to know
how this happened?

343
00:16:34,404 --> 00:16:35,105
Nothing my mother
would be embarrassed by.

344
00:16:35,571 --> 00:16:36,539
Okay.

345
00:16:37,573 --> 00:16:39,209
What's with the suit?
You... you never wear a suit.

346
00:16:39,309 --> 00:16:41,277
I gotta see a guy
about a thing.

347
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,752
Hey.

348
00:16:49,852 --> 00:16:51,187
Oh, my God.

349
00:16:57,427 --> 00:17:00,430
Thank you for coming.
So good to see you.

350
00:17:02,132 --> 00:17:03,799
Hey.
Sorry for your loss.

351
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:05,701
Thank you.

352
00:17:05,801 --> 00:17:07,837
He was like a brother to me.

353
00:17:07,937 --> 00:17:10,206
It's a fucking shame.

354
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:43,506
I'm sorry about Carmine.

355
00:17:45,475 --> 00:17:47,710
Al.

356
00:17:54,784 --> 00:17:58,221
They made it so he couldn't
even have an open coffin.

357
00:17:58,321 --> 00:17:59,789
That way, the people
that... that love him

358
00:17:59,889 --> 00:18:02,858
can't say goodbye
the right way.

359
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:06,396
It's just not done.

360
00:18:06,496 --> 00:18:08,698
You did the right thing
by coming here.

361
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:11,534
I appreciate that.

362
00:18:11,634 --> 00:18:13,903
Well, there's an old saying.

363
00:18:14,003 --> 00:18:15,805
"Nobody should be invited
to a funeral

364
00:18:15,905 --> 00:18:18,241
and everyone should come."

365
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:22,378
Carmine would've liked that.

366
00:18:22,478 --> 00:18:25,915
He had a great sense of humor.

367
00:18:26,015 --> 00:18:28,218
He was a funny motherfucker.

368
00:18:31,754 --> 00:18:34,156
Come on.

369
00:18:34,257 --> 00:18:36,492
How's the movie going?

370
00:18:36,592 --> 00:18:38,661
Actually, Biaggi's making
more problems for us.

371
00:18:38,761 --> 00:18:40,763
He pulled all the permits
from the film office.

372
00:18:40,863 --> 00:18:42,265
I'm taking care of it.

373
00:18:42,365 --> 00:18:44,534
I got my own issues
with that fuck.

374
00:18:46,369 --> 00:18:49,839
I'm sorry to bother you
on a day like this.

375
00:18:49,939 --> 00:18:52,275
It is what it is.

376
00:19:01,984 --> 00:19:02,752
How's your son?

377
00:19:02,852 --> 00:19:04,787
He's good.
He's really good.

378
00:19:04,887 --> 00:19:08,624
He... he's thinking
about politics.

379
00:19:08,724 --> 00:19:09,625
Politics?

380
00:19:09,725 --> 00:19:11,927
Yeah, he's a smart kid.

381
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:14,497
He's smarter than me.

382
00:19:14,597 --> 00:19:16,432
He's lookin' for
a less complicated life.

383
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:20,703
Well, what I do
is hardly uncomplicated.

384
00:19:20,803 --> 00:19:24,274
But I wish you and your family
only the best.

385
00:19:24,374 --> 00:19:28,210
Is that your way
of apologizing for the raid?

386
00:19:28,311 --> 00:19:31,414
The raid?

387
00:19:31,514 --> 00:19:33,816
Think twice about
lying to me, Congressman.

388
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:37,287
The League is now
over 200,000 strong,

389
00:19:37,387 --> 00:19:40,323
and as we both know,
you have a campaign comin' up.

390
00:19:40,423 --> 00:19:41,657
I got plenty of friends

391
00:19:41,757 --> 00:19:44,294
who wouldn't mind taking a shot
at your seat,

392
00:19:44,394 --> 00:19:47,897
and with the full backing
of every member in the League,

393
00:19:47,997 --> 00:19:52,635
plus their big, fat
Italian families.

394
00:19:52,735 --> 00:19:54,904
Joe.

395
00:19:55,004 --> 00:19:58,574
There's been a misunderstanding
between us.

396
00:19:58,674 --> 00:20:00,776
Oh. Maybe.

397
00:20:00,876 --> 00:20:03,646
If I may,

398
00:20:03,746 --> 00:20:06,349
I want a clean slate.

399
00:20:06,449 --> 00:20:07,983
I'm listening.

400
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,586
We're both proud
Italian Americans

401
00:20:10,686 --> 00:20:13,489
who want what's best
for our people.

402
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:16,959
So what can I do
to heal this rift between us

403
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:19,362
so we can, you know,
help each other?

404
00:20:19,462 --> 00:20:21,931
Stronger together, is that
the tune you're singing now?

405
00:20:22,031 --> 00:20:24,033
Good, good.

406
00:20:24,133 --> 00:20:27,703
Get the feds
off my fucking back.

407
00:20:27,803 --> 00:20:29,805
Consider it done.

408
00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:35,511
And one more thing.

409
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:39,449
Film noir set in the '20s
about city politics.

410
00:20:39,549 --> 00:20:40,783
Bob Towne wrote it.

411
00:20:40,883 --> 00:20:42,552
It's called "Chinatown."

412
00:20:42,652 --> 00:20:44,554
I read it over the weekend,
actually, in one sitting.

413
00:20:44,654 --> 00:20:46,389
Is this the one with
the winning combination

414
00:20:46,489 --> 00:20:47,990
of incest and water rights?

415
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:50,326
That's it.

416
00:20:50,426 --> 00:20:55,030
I'll take a look at it.

417
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,032
Bob?
Hmm?

418
00:20:57,132 --> 00:21:00,002
Something going on?

419
00:21:00,102 --> 00:21:02,071
When I was negotiating
for Pacino,

420
00:21:02,171 --> 00:21:04,340
Aubrey told me

421
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,975
that he heard that Paramount
was being spun off.

422
00:21:06,075 --> 00:21:07,477
You heard anything about that?

423
00:21:07,577 --> 00:21:10,446
No. Nothing.
Not since months ago.

424
00:21:10,546 --> 00:21:11,981
I thought Bluhdorn said
he'd keep you in the know.

425
00:21:12,081 --> 00:21:13,383
Yeah.

426
00:21:13,483 --> 00:21:15,851
He told me "Love Story"
had to deliver.

427
00:21:15,951 --> 00:21:21,323
It just passed $100 million.
I'd say that qualifies.

428
00:21:21,424 --> 00:21:23,325
Aubrey's just trying
to get under your skin.

429
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,902
Ugh, it's too exposed.
It's too open.

430
00:21:33,002 --> 00:21:35,070
It needs to be protected.

431
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:38,441
Well, maybe we can
build a wall.

432
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:39,709
How much?

433
00:21:39,809 --> 00:21:41,544
Ballard's up my ass
about the budget, guys.

434
00:21:41,644 --> 00:21:45,415
Um, it's... it's... it's cheap.

435
00:21:45,515 --> 00:21:47,683
You know, it's Styrofoam.

436
00:21:47,783 --> 00:21:50,986
We just paint it
to look like stone.

437
00:21:51,086 --> 00:21:53,789
How tall is that wall?
Eight feet?

438
00:21:53,889 --> 00:21:55,791
Well, it's going to cast
a shadow in the late morning.

439
00:21:55,891 --> 00:21:57,393
You can light that out.

440
00:21:57,493 --> 00:21:59,662
Maybe, if I get the lighting
package I asked for.

441
00:21:59,762 --> 00:22:02,031
The... the shadows,
they help tell the story.

442
00:22:02,131 --> 00:22:03,433
If that's the intention.

443
00:22:03,533 --> 00:22:04,900
What the fuck is this?

444
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,439
A kitchen that costs $75,000?
Is this a joke?

445
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:10,740
They gotta cook.

446
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,141
We're not opening up
a restaurant, Francis.

447
00:22:12,241 --> 00:22:14,410
They can pretend.

448
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:17,980
All department heads
in the conference room now.

449
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,449
No gangster film,

450
00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:20,983
since the beginning
of recorded history,

451
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:23,619
ever needed a working kitchen.

452
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:25,721
It's not just
about the cooking.

453
00:22:25,821 --> 00:22:27,389
This is the scene

454
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:29,158
where Clemenza
is talking to Michael

455
00:22:29,258 --> 00:22:31,160
and he tells him
that the families

456
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,962
have to go to war
every ten years or so.

457
00:22:33,062 --> 00:22:34,464
And while
he's telling them that,

458
00:22:34,564 --> 00:22:35,765
they just happen to be making
tomato sauce,

459
00:22:35,865 --> 00:22:38,534
and that's why the scene
is so important.

460
00:22:38,634 --> 00:22:40,870
I love this scene.
You never see anything like it

461
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:42,472
- in a gangster film.
- It's essential.

462
00:22:42,572 --> 00:22:44,540
You have to see them
making the tomato sauce.

463
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,075
It humanizes them.

464
00:22:46,175 --> 00:22:47,577
Remember,
it makes them relatable?

465
00:22:47,677 --> 00:22:49,845
If you want it so badly,
you can pay for it.

466
00:22:49,945 --> 00:22:52,047
Francis, is that a propane
line with special effects?

467
00:22:52,147 --> 00:22:53,449
It's practical gas.

468
00:22:53,549 --> 00:22:54,850
Propane's fine. No.

469
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,752
Propane does not burn
like practical gas.

470
00:22:56,852 --> 00:22:58,153
It does now.

471
00:22:58,253 --> 00:22:59,655
Sorry to interrupt.

472
00:23:00,756 --> 00:23:01,457
I just got off the phone
with the film commission.

473
00:23:02,124 --> 00:23:02,658
We've got our permits back.

474
00:23:03,325 --> 00:23:03,826
Why was that ever in doubt?

475
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,995
You guys meeting
about this budget?

476
00:23:06,095 --> 00:23:07,196
Oh, God.

477
00:23:07,296 --> 00:23:09,064
Yeah, we're making some cuts.
Good.

478
00:23:09,164 --> 00:23:10,533
Then my timing is perfect.

479
00:23:10,633 --> 00:23:12,535
Anna, where are we at
with costumes?

480
00:23:12,635 --> 00:23:14,169
Over budget.
We know, Jack.

481
00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:16,205
That's why we're talking it
through, buddy.

482
00:23:16,305 --> 00:23:17,873
There's just nothing
quality in inventory

483
00:23:17,973 --> 00:23:19,441
from the '40s,

484
00:23:19,542 --> 00:23:20,476
so we're gonna
have to do a build

485
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,911
on most of the major players.

486
00:23:22,011 --> 00:23:24,647
That's at least two suits
per player per scene.

487
00:23:24,747 --> 00:23:26,849
And an additional 200 grand
we don't have.

488
00:23:26,949 --> 00:23:28,450
Well, more because
we still have to dress

489
00:23:28,551 --> 00:23:29,752
everyone at the wedding.

490
00:23:29,852 --> 00:23:31,453
What if it's a small,
intimate affair,

491
00:23:31,554 --> 00:23:32,822
maybe only family?

492
00:23:32,922 --> 00:23:33,689
Stop!

493
00:23:34,356 --> 00:23:35,024
It can't be a small affair.

494
00:23:35,691 --> 00:23:36,559
She's the daughter of the Don.

495
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:37,493
There are a lot
of speaking parts.

496
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:39,862
Maybe you can combine
some of them.

497
00:23:39,962 --> 00:23:40,963
Oh, I forgot.

498
00:23:41,864 --> 00:23:42,732
We're doing
an off-off-Broadway play now.

499
00:23:43,499 --> 00:23:44,900
Okay, look,
everybody just relax.

500
00:23:46,135 --> 00:23:47,837
We are still making the movie
that we all set out to make.

501
00:23:47,937 --> 00:23:50,706
Well, we're also still
about $2 million over budget

502
00:23:50,806 --> 00:23:52,875
so unless you know something,
I don't know, Mr. Producer,

503
00:23:52,975 --> 00:23:54,877
I suggest
you grab your scissors

504
00:23:54,977 --> 00:23:57,813
and start making cuts
everywhere.

505
00:23:57,913 --> 00:24:00,182
Where there's a will,
there's a way.

506
00:24:11,661 --> 00:24:13,996
Hey, Al.
Got a sec?

507
00:24:14,096 --> 00:24:15,030
Yeah.

508
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:17,667
So we've got a problem.

509
00:24:17,767 --> 00:24:19,902
Look, Andrea,
I just want to say I think

510
00:24:20,002 --> 00:24:23,639
you're doing an incredible job
casting this movie.

511
00:24:23,739 --> 00:24:25,908
And it's obvious to me
that Paramount,

512
00:24:26,008 --> 00:24:29,278
they knew what they were doing
when they hired you.

513
00:24:29,378 --> 00:24:31,981
Thank you.
You're welcome. It's true.

514
00:24:32,081 --> 00:24:34,249
And, uh, listen,

515
00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:35,885
about the other night.

516
00:24:35,985 --> 00:24:38,688
We both had a lot to drink
and I'm not...

517
00:24:38,788 --> 00:24:40,089
I'm not saying I was drunk.

518
00:24:40,189 --> 00:24:41,857
Obviously,
I knew what I was doing,

519
00:24:41,957 --> 00:24:44,994
but, you know,
we're working together.

520
00:24:45,094 --> 00:24:47,663
And for me personally, I just
got out of a relationship,

521
00:24:47,763 --> 00:24:50,299
so, you know,
it's probably best if we just...

522
00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:52,234
Al, stop.

523
00:24:52,334 --> 00:24:53,569
That's not the problem

524
00:24:53,669 --> 00:24:55,104
I was talking about.

525
00:24:55,204 --> 00:24:56,606
Oh.

526
00:24:56,706 --> 00:24:58,741
We still don't have an actor
to play Luca Brasi.

527
00:24:58,841 --> 00:25:02,745
It's the last big role
we need to cast.

528
00:25:02,845 --> 00:25:05,815
Don't worry about it.
We'll find somebody.

529
00:25:08,718 --> 00:25:11,320
Just so we're clear,
I'm a grown woman.

530
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,155
We both know what it was
and what it wasn't.

531
00:25:13,255 --> 00:25:15,090
Relax.

532
00:25:21,296 --> 00:25:23,699
You know how we said

533
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:26,802
that we can make
this picture for 4 million?

534
00:25:26,902 --> 00:25:29,004
Well, unless half the crew
works for free,

535
00:25:29,104 --> 00:25:30,305
we're never gonna get there.
You gotta call Bob.

536
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:32,642
No, that's a check
I can't cash.

537
00:25:32,742 --> 00:25:34,610
I used it all up on Pacino.

538
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:37,046
What... so what?
You just quit?

539
00:25:37,146 --> 00:25:38,648
That's not fair.

540
00:25:38,748 --> 00:25:40,015
What does fair have to do
with anything?

541
00:25:50,325 --> 00:25:52,261
What's this?

542
00:25:52,361 --> 00:25:53,763
A script.

543
00:25:56,131 --> 00:25:58,100
It's called "Chinatown."

544
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,935
Any good?

545
00:26:00,035 --> 00:26:02,805
A lot of talk about water
in the future.

546
00:26:02,905 --> 00:26:05,374
You think it would be dull,
but it's oddly compelling.

547
00:26:05,474 --> 00:26:07,877
Anything for me in it?

548
00:26:07,977 --> 00:26:09,378
No.

549
00:26:12,948 --> 00:26:16,919
Can we talk about something
that's important to me?

550
00:26:17,019 --> 00:26:19,121
Yeah. What?

551
00:26:19,221 --> 00:26:20,723
"The Getaway."

552
00:26:20,823 --> 00:26:22,124
We passed on it.

553
00:26:22,224 --> 00:26:25,695
Well, Warner Brothers didn't
and they're making it.

554
00:26:25,795 --> 00:26:27,296
Steve McQueen just signed on

555
00:26:27,396 --> 00:26:29,765
and there's a part
that I really want.

556
00:26:29,865 --> 00:26:32,201
McQueen is in prison,
helps a crook plan a heist.

557
00:26:32,301 --> 00:26:33,836
The crook betrays Steve,

558
00:26:33,936 --> 00:26:35,871
and they take off across Texas
with the money,

559
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:38,674
running from the law
and the criminals.

560
00:26:38,774 --> 00:26:40,910
A strong woman, quick thinker.

561
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:43,178
Walter Hill wrote it,
Peckinpah is directing,

562
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:45,681
and... and they want me.

563
00:26:45,781 --> 00:26:47,149
It's not good enough
for you, Al,

564
00:26:47,249 --> 00:26:49,919
and I really don't have time
for this right now.

565
00:26:53,488 --> 00:26:56,191
I'm going to do it.

566
00:26:56,291 --> 00:26:57,359
Starts shooting next week.

567
00:26:57,459 --> 00:26:58,961
Do you want my opinion
or my blessing?

568
00:26:59,061 --> 00:27:01,797
I want you to support
my opinion with your blessing.

569
00:27:01,897 --> 00:27:03,365
How about I tell your agent
I'm not gonna work with him

570
00:27:03,465 --> 00:27:05,434
if they let you do this.
How about that?

571
00:27:05,534 --> 00:27:07,770
And destroy your marriage.

572
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:08,804
Ali.

573
00:27:08,904 --> 00:27:10,239
Ali, come on.
Come back.

574
00:27:10,339 --> 00:27:12,374
Hey.
What?

575
00:27:12,474 --> 00:27:13,843
Look, I don't wanna fight,

576
00:27:13,943 --> 00:27:15,845
but I'm under a lot of pressure
right now.

577
00:27:15,945 --> 00:27:17,412
Thanks to you,
"Love Story" was a huge hit,

578
00:27:17,512 --> 00:27:19,915
but if "The Godfather"
doesn't follow, I'm fucked.

579
00:27:20,015 --> 00:27:24,086
I can't give Bluhdorn
a reason to sell, okay?

580
00:27:26,922 --> 00:27:29,424
Bob still hasn't returned
any of my calls.

581
00:27:29,524 --> 00:27:30,726
Sheila says
he's still pissed.

582
00:27:30,826 --> 00:27:31,927
He needs time to cool off.

583
00:27:32,995 --> 00:27:34,730
She said you should just
go to Bluhdorn yourself.

584
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,331
Remind me never to cross
the assistant pool.

585
00:27:36,431 --> 00:27:38,333
It's more dangerous
in the mafia.

586
00:27:38,433 --> 00:27:41,403
You have no idea.

587
00:27:41,503 --> 00:27:43,138
You made any headway
with the budget?

588
00:27:43,238 --> 00:27:46,408
Not unless you got a couple
extra million lying around.

589
00:27:46,508 --> 00:27:48,978
Do you want me
to take a look at it?

590
00:27:49,078 --> 00:27:51,446
The budget? Yeah, sure.
Knock yourself out.

591
00:27:51,546 --> 00:27:54,016
You gonna take
Sheila's advice?

592
00:27:54,116 --> 00:27:55,117
Yeah.

593
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:03,125
How is he today?

594
00:28:06,896 --> 00:28:08,764
Mr. Bluhdorn
will see you now.

595
00:28:08,864 --> 00:28:10,199
We're going in.

596
00:28:13,302 --> 00:28:15,170
You want more money.

597
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,471
Charlie, come on.

598
00:28:16,571 --> 00:28:18,273
We just came by
to see how your day was going.

599
00:28:18,373 --> 00:28:19,909
Ah, it's all bullshit.

600
00:28:20,009 --> 00:28:23,245
This being polite is a waste
of at least an hour every day.

601
00:28:23,345 --> 00:28:24,379
How are you?

602
00:28:24,479 --> 00:28:26,748
How's your kids?
How's your wife?

603
00:28:26,849 --> 00:28:27,983
Well, what do you say?

604
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:30,085
She's got a suspicious mole.
Who gives a shit?

605
00:28:30,185 --> 00:28:31,520
You're being polite.
That's your tell.

606
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,055
You want more money

607
00:28:33,155 --> 00:28:35,324
and you agreed to do this film
for 4.5.

608
00:28:35,424 --> 00:28:37,126
It can't be done for 4.5.

609
00:28:37,226 --> 00:28:39,061
Low budget
specialist, my ass.

610
00:28:39,161 --> 00:28:41,263
Look, Charlie, I got all
the actors to work for scale,

611
00:28:41,363 --> 00:28:43,498
including Marlon Brando.

612
00:28:43,598 --> 00:28:45,300
I'm getting tax breaks
from the city.

613
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,936
It's just still
not enough money.

614
00:28:47,036 --> 00:28:49,538
Have you spoken to Evans?

615
00:28:49,638 --> 00:28:51,340
He's not returning my calls.

616
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,842
Oh, and who's fault is that?

617
00:28:52,942 --> 00:28:54,176
I warned you.

618
00:28:54,276 --> 00:28:56,979
You made this bed
you're sleeping in, Ruddy.

619
00:29:04,286 --> 00:29:07,089
I'm gonna make you an offer.

620
00:29:07,189 --> 00:29:09,491
Take it or leave it.

621
00:29:09,591 --> 00:29:13,162
Ruddy, you and Coppola
can get 6 million,

622
00:29:13,262 --> 00:29:15,464
but you both have to
put up your fees

623
00:29:15,564 --> 00:29:17,466
against any overages.

624
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:22,337
We'll have to talk
about that.

625
00:29:22,437 --> 00:29:24,974
We'll take it.

626
00:29:25,074 --> 00:29:27,276
He spoke. We're done.

627
00:29:27,376 --> 00:29:29,044
Get the fuck out of my office.

628
00:29:29,144 --> 00:29:30,946
We could've gotten to 6.5.

629
00:29:31,046 --> 00:29:32,181
He said take it or leave it.

630
00:29:32,281 --> 00:29:33,815
Let it go, Al.

631
00:29:33,916 --> 00:29:36,218
The Corleones are expecting us
for dinner.

632
00:29:43,092 --> 00:29:45,160
Hey.

633
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:48,130
We're in here.
Yeah, here we go.

634
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,099
Very nice.

635
00:29:50,199 --> 00:29:53,302
Hello.
How you doing, Bob, Morgana?

636
00:29:53,402 --> 00:29:55,404
Talia.
Oh, look at you.

637
00:29:55,504 --> 00:29:56,571
Hey.

638
00:29:56,671 --> 00:29:58,173
John.
How are you, sir?

639
00:29:58,273 --> 00:29:59,508
Jimmy, come here.

640
00:29:59,608 --> 00:30:01,210
Look who's decided
to show up, huh?

641
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,477
I guess you're the boss.
You're the boss.

642
00:30:02,577 --> 00:30:04,079
How are ya? Good.

643
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:06,882
What's going on, buddy?
Hey, boss.

644
00:30:06,982 --> 00:30:10,585
Diane, Al, beautiful.

645
00:30:10,685 --> 00:30:12,922
Hey, look, it's Carlo.

646
00:30:13,022 --> 00:30:15,024
The douchebag has arrived.

647
00:30:16,358 --> 00:30:18,894
Here you go, Marlon.

648
00:30:18,994 --> 00:30:22,331
Thank you.
Thank you for being here.

649
00:30:22,431 --> 00:30:26,001
Ladies and gentlemen.

650
00:30:26,101 --> 00:30:28,303
Ladies and gentlemen,

651
00:30:28,403 --> 00:30:30,272
may I have your attention,
please?

652
00:30:34,609 --> 00:30:36,946
Oh, I want to thank you all
for coming out tonight.

653
00:30:37,046 --> 00:30:39,014
This is very exciting.

654
00:30:39,114 --> 00:30:40,382
You all look wonderful.

655
00:30:40,482 --> 00:30:42,317
And I just thought it would be
really nice

656
00:30:42,417 --> 00:30:45,154
to have the Corleone family
come together

657
00:30:45,254 --> 00:30:47,957
for a real Italian dinner, huh?

658
00:30:48,057 --> 00:30:50,092
Before we all start shooting
in a couple days.

659
00:30:50,192 --> 00:30:51,326
That's it.
Just enjoy yourself.

660
00:30:51,426 --> 00:30:54,964
Sit wherever you want
and let's eat.

661
00:30:55,064 --> 00:30:56,231
Mangia.

662
00:31:26,295 --> 00:31:26,996
Here you go.

663
00:31:27,096 --> 00:31:29,564
I'm not the head
of this family.

664
00:31:29,664 --> 00:31:32,034
Right.
I should help.

665
00:31:32,134 --> 00:31:33,635
Oh, no, no, no, no.
She's got it.

666
00:31:33,735 --> 00:31:35,304
Stay here with me.

667
00:31:35,404 --> 00:31:38,207
No, no.
Your mother first. Always.

668
00:31:46,148 --> 00:31:48,517
Are you gonna sit down
or what?

669
00:31:49,584 --> 00:31:51,653
You get any eggplant?
No.

670
00:31:51,753 --> 00:31:52,654
Well, you gotta try some.

671
00:31:52,754 --> 00:31:55,290
You want me to get you some?

672
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:59,094
I... it's just I was gonna
get some anyway, you know?

673
00:31:59,194 --> 00:32:01,496
So I... I thought
I... I can get you some.

674
00:32:15,244 --> 00:32:17,379
I appreciate having
the whole family together

675
00:32:17,479 --> 00:32:20,049
for my birthday.

676
00:32:20,149 --> 00:32:22,117
Many things happen in life.

677
00:32:22,217 --> 00:32:27,089
Celebrations, tragedies,
births, deaths.

678
00:32:27,189 --> 00:32:28,290
But through it all,

679
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:30,559
what's right here
is what's important.

680
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:32,394
Family.

681
00:32:32,494 --> 00:32:33,528
May you live forever.

682
00:32:33,628 --> 00:32:36,698
- Ah, salud.
- Salud!

683
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:38,433
Ooh-hoo.

684
00:32:43,838 --> 00:32:46,007
You make this?
Mm.

685
00:32:46,108 --> 00:32:48,177
Mom's recipe.

686
00:32:48,277 --> 00:32:49,744
Christ, it's the best
thing I ever put in my mouth.

687
00:32:49,844 --> 00:32:51,146
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey, stuggatz,

688
00:32:51,246 --> 00:32:53,148
you know how lucky you are?

689
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:54,583
I think she's the lucky one.

690
00:32:54,683 --> 00:32:55,717
You don't know
what you're in for.

691
00:32:55,817 --> 00:32:56,751
You're gonna need both hands

692
00:32:56,851 --> 00:32:58,019
to deal with that one, right?

693
00:32:59,521 --> 00:33:02,191
I only need one hand
to enforce my rules.

694
00:33:03,592 --> 00:33:05,560
What did you just say?

695
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,561
Did you just threaten her?

696
00:33:09,398 --> 00:33:11,733
Everybody needs a smack
once in a while.

697
00:33:11,833 --> 00:33:13,268
Hey, hey.

698
00:33:13,368 --> 00:33:16,405
Come on.

699
00:33:16,505 --> 00:33:19,374
That's enough.

700
00:33:19,474 --> 00:33:21,042
Who's this jamoke
think he is?

701
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:25,447
Has this man
laid a hand on you?

702
00:33:25,547 --> 00:33:26,648
No, Pop. No, no.

703
00:33:26,748 --> 00:33:29,118
It... it... it was my fault.

704
00:33:29,218 --> 00:33:30,485
I didn't do nothing.

705
00:33:30,585 --> 00:33:33,722
You know what the name
"Corleone" means?

706
00:33:33,822 --> 00:33:36,258
"Heart of a lion."

707
00:33:36,358 --> 00:33:39,328
So if I were you,
I wouldn't bring any attention

708
00:33:39,428 --> 00:33:41,330
to the fact that
I'm the slowest in the herd.

709
00:33:50,639 --> 00:33:53,675
If I offended you,
I'm sorry, godfather.

710
00:33:53,775 --> 00:33:55,544
What do you have
to be sorry for?

711
00:33:55,644 --> 00:33:57,779
You said you never hit her.

712
00:33:57,879 --> 00:33:59,814
I'm just happy to be
in your family.

713
00:33:59,914 --> 00:34:01,450
Kiss the ring.

714
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:03,285
Huh?

715
00:34:03,385 --> 00:34:04,319
Huh?

716
00:34:05,187 --> 00:34:06,388
Kiss the fucking ring,
you fucking idiot.

717
00:34:06,488 --> 00:34:07,122
Kiss it.

718
00:34:07,222 --> 00:34:09,624
- Kiss it.
- Kiss it.

719
00:34:09,724 --> 00:34:13,362
Kiss it, kiss it, kiss it.

720
00:34:13,462 --> 00:34:14,463
Hey, kiss it.

721
00:34:14,563 --> 00:34:15,597
Kiss it, kiss it.

722
00:34:15,697 --> 00:34:17,766
Kiss it.

723
00:34:17,866 --> 00:34:19,868
Kiss it, kiss it!

724
00:34:22,837 --> 00:34:24,406
Everybody mangia.

725
00:34:26,208 --> 00:34:29,544
Can you believe
this guy, huh?

726
00:34:29,644 --> 00:34:31,180
You know what I'm thinking?

727
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,747
This is gonna be
a great film.

728
00:34:32,847 --> 00:34:33,782
Yeah.

729
00:34:33,882 --> 00:34:36,351
And they need a stove.

730
00:34:36,451 --> 00:34:37,886
You had to bring that up,
didn't you?

731
00:34:37,986 --> 00:34:40,355
Can't I just have
one good moment

732
00:34:40,455 --> 00:34:42,457
without it being taken away
from me on this project?

733
00:34:42,557 --> 00:34:43,858
I'm sorry.

734
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:45,394
You're right.
You're absolutely right.

735
00:34:45,494 --> 00:34:47,629
But food is so important
to this family.

736
00:34:47,729 --> 00:34:50,365
Well, this family is gonna
have to get by with one burner.

737
00:34:50,465 --> 00:34:51,666
Yeah?

738
00:34:54,803 --> 00:34:57,138
Hey! Al.

739
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,508
I heard last night went well.

740
00:34:59,608 --> 00:35:01,210
Your friend Gianni
didn't think so.

741
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:03,212
What a schmegege.

742
00:35:06,948 --> 00:35:10,685
So I've been going through
the budget.

743
00:35:10,785 --> 00:35:12,254
Uh-huh.

744
00:35:12,354 --> 00:35:13,555
And?

745
00:35:13,655 --> 00:35:16,157
And there seem to be

746
00:35:16,258 --> 00:35:18,827
three men with
very Italian-sounding names.

747
00:35:18,927 --> 00:35:20,929
They don't belong
to any department.

748
00:35:21,029 --> 00:35:22,564
They're on payroll,

749
00:35:22,664 --> 00:35:25,600
but I can't find them
on the crew list.

750
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,168
Al.

751
00:35:27,269 --> 00:35:29,304
One of them is Caesar.

752
00:35:29,404 --> 00:35:30,605
Caesar, I just saw him
at the wake.

753
00:35:30,705 --> 00:35:32,441
He didn't mention anything.
Who hired him?

754
00:35:32,541 --> 00:35:34,175
Probably one of the unions.

755
00:35:34,276 --> 00:35:36,678
That's not weirdest part.

756
00:35:36,778 --> 00:35:38,913
All three of these guys,

757
00:35:39,013 --> 00:35:43,485
they have the same
social security number.

758
00:35:43,585 --> 00:35:44,786
Really?

759
00:35:44,886 --> 00:35:46,588
I don't know
why you find that funny.

760
00:35:46,688 --> 00:35:48,923
Gulf and Western
is a publicly-traded company.

761
00:35:49,023 --> 00:35:52,394
If they find out
we have mobsters on payroll,

762
00:35:52,494 --> 00:35:54,563
it's over for all of us.

763
00:35:54,663 --> 00:35:57,766
Look, get me Caesar.
I'll talk to him.

764
00:36:03,805 --> 00:36:08,910
Caesar.

765
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:10,279
What's this about?

766
00:36:10,379 --> 00:36:11,946
You could have finished lunch.

767
00:36:12,046 --> 00:36:13,948
That's not how I like
to do things.

768
00:36:14,048 --> 00:36:16,485
Never make the boss wait.

769
00:36:16,585 --> 00:36:18,953
Right.
Let me ask you something.

770
00:36:19,053 --> 00:36:21,856
What exactly do you do here?

771
00:36:21,956 --> 00:36:24,559
I am a production assistant.

772
00:36:24,659 --> 00:36:27,662
And who do you assist?

773
00:36:27,762 --> 00:36:28,963
The production.

774
00:36:29,063 --> 00:36:32,401
And what does production do?

775
00:36:32,501 --> 00:36:35,470
Like, if there's a problem
with the unions,

776
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:40,275
I assist the unions
to not be a problem.

777
00:36:40,375 --> 00:36:42,544
Moving right along.

778
00:36:42,644 --> 00:36:46,014
These guys down here,
what do they do?

779
00:36:46,114 --> 00:36:48,517
Those are my guys.
They're, um...

780
00:36:48,617 --> 00:36:51,886
production assistant's
assistants.

781
00:36:51,986 --> 00:36:53,388
Listen, you guys can't all

782
00:36:53,488 --> 00:36:56,257
have the same
social security number.

783
00:36:56,358 --> 00:37:00,762
Al, you know who you gotta
talk to about that.

784
00:37:00,862 --> 00:37:01,796
You need anything else, boss?

785
00:37:01,896 --> 00:37:04,366
'Cause, um,
I gotta take a dump.

786
00:37:04,466 --> 00:37:06,335
Good luck with that.

787
00:37:10,772 --> 00:37:12,641
How you doing?
Hi.

788
00:37:16,778 --> 00:37:20,048
Al, there are two FBI agents
waiting for you.

789
00:37:25,487 --> 00:37:27,356
Thanks so much for seeing us
on short notice.

790
00:37:27,456 --> 00:37:29,391
I'm Agent Zabel.
This is Agent Richman.

791
00:37:29,491 --> 00:37:30,992
What can I do for you boys?

792
00:37:31,092 --> 00:37:32,827
What exactly do you do here,
Mr. Ruddy?

793
00:37:32,927 --> 00:37:34,663
I'm the producer.

794
00:37:34,763 --> 00:37:35,697
You mind telling us

795
00:37:36,598 --> 00:37:38,400
why you were at
Carmine Vispiciano's wake?

796
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,935
He was a friend.
Where's this going?

797
00:37:41,035 --> 00:37:42,504
Well, I guess
we were just wondering

798
00:37:42,604 --> 00:37:43,938
how a man with
top security clearance

799
00:37:44,038 --> 00:37:45,006
with the Rand Corporation

800
00:37:45,106 --> 00:37:48,410
is now in bed with the mafia.

801
00:37:50,144 --> 00:37:52,514
Well, fellas,

802
00:37:52,614 --> 00:37:56,551
you know how they say that
truth is stranger than fiction?

803
00:37:57,118 --> 00:37:59,688
I see nothing, nothing!

804
00:38:00,955 --> 00:38:02,323
Exactly.
That's pretty good.

805
00:38:02,424 --> 00:38:04,325
So why did you walk away
from "Hogan's Heroes"?

806
00:38:04,426 --> 00:38:06,395
TV's too limiting.

807
00:38:06,495 --> 00:38:08,730
You can't tell real stories
on TV.

808
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:09,831
It's fake.

809
00:38:09,931 --> 00:38:13,101
And Marlon Brando
doesn't do TV.

810
00:38:13,201 --> 00:38:14,836
Al, you seem like a nice guy.

811
00:38:14,936 --> 00:38:16,505
Let me give you some advice.

812
00:38:16,605 --> 00:38:17,972
These guys are a lot
more dangerous

813
00:38:18,072 --> 00:38:19,508
than they first appear.
Look, honestly,

814
00:38:19,608 --> 00:38:21,410
I'm just trying
to make my movie

815
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,712
and that's where
the association ends.

816
00:38:23,812 --> 00:38:26,448
So I gave one of them a job,
hence the badge.

817
00:38:26,548 --> 00:38:28,082
It's safer for him here
than working out there.

818
00:38:28,182 --> 00:38:29,518
Not safer for you.

819
00:38:29,618 --> 00:38:30,619
And we'd feel a lot better

820
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:32,020
if we can keep
a closer eye on you.

821
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,121
If you let us
put a wire on you,

822
00:38:33,221 --> 00:38:35,056
we can protect you.

823
00:38:38,893 --> 00:38:43,665
I appreciate it, guys, but
I'll take my chances on my own.

824
00:38:49,571 --> 00:38:51,540
Yeah, she's gonna do
"The Getaway" next.

825
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,476
Well, Peckinpah
is a great director.

826
00:38:54,576 --> 00:38:56,578
We just figured it was the
best move after "Love Story"

827
00:38:56,678 --> 00:39:01,149
so she doesn't get typecast
as the shiksa goddess.

828
00:39:01,249 --> 00:39:03,418
No, no, I... I've never worked
with McQueen.

829
00:39:03,518 --> 00:39:04,385
What do you know about him,
Cary?

830
00:39:06,655 --> 00:39:08,457
Look, I gotta go, Cary.

831
00:39:08,557 --> 00:39:10,859
Thank you so much for the info
and I'll speak soon.

832
00:39:10,959 --> 00:39:11,893
All right, bye.

833
00:39:11,993 --> 00:39:15,864
It's Lapidus.

834
00:39:15,964 --> 00:39:16,998
Barry!

835
00:39:17,098 --> 00:39:18,066
How they hanging?

836
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:19,801
Guess what I'm calling about.

837
00:39:19,901 --> 00:39:23,004
Another sock sale
at Brooks Brothers?

838
00:39:23,104 --> 00:39:26,407
You were right about
"Love Story."

839
00:39:26,508 --> 00:39:27,408
Well, thank you, Barry.

840
00:39:27,509 --> 00:39:28,743
Maybe I do know what I'm doing.

841
00:39:28,843 --> 00:39:31,012
You have made the board
very happy.

842
00:39:31,112 --> 00:39:33,982
Gulf and Western's
stock price is up.

843
00:39:34,082 --> 00:39:35,817
Nice work, Bobby.

844
00:39:50,699 --> 00:39:52,901
Peter, I just had
a wacko call from Lapidus.

845
00:39:53,001 --> 00:39:54,135
Aubrey wasn't bluffing.

846
00:39:54,235 --> 00:39:56,605
They're trying
to sell Paramount.

847
00:39:57,005 --> 00:40:00,542
And?

848
00:40:00,642 --> 00:40:01,976
Tastes like fish bait.

849
00:40:02,076 --> 00:40:03,812
But is too small
to slip on a hook.

850
00:40:03,912 --> 00:40:04,979
Ugh.

851
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:06,180
That's impossible.

852
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,484
It's $200 caviar
from the Caspian Sea.

853
00:40:09,584 --> 00:40:12,687
I don't care if it was $1,000
and came out of God's ass.

854
00:40:12,787 --> 00:40:15,123
If I'm eating eggs,
I want 'em cracked, fried,

855
00:40:15,223 --> 00:40:16,791
and covered in cheese.

856
00:40:20,529 --> 00:40:22,130
I'm glad you could make
some time for me.

857
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:23,965
I know Ruddy
keeps you very busy.

858
00:40:24,065 --> 00:40:25,534
Yeah.

859
00:40:25,634 --> 00:40:28,169
Well, anything
for a free drink.

860
00:40:31,172 --> 00:40:33,608
So tell me,

861
00:40:33,708 --> 00:40:36,711
what does Bettye want?

862
00:40:36,811 --> 00:40:39,013
I'm not sure what you mean.

863
00:40:39,113 --> 00:40:39,948
What do you want
for yourself?

864
00:40:40,048 --> 00:40:42,651
What do you want to do
with your life?

865
00:40:42,751 --> 00:40:44,953
What is this?

866
00:40:45,053 --> 00:40:47,021
Are you trying to be
my mentor now or something?

867
00:40:47,121 --> 00:40:50,525
Do you enjoy
working as Ruddy's secretary,

868
00:40:50,625 --> 00:40:53,261
pouring coffee,
answering phones?

869
00:40:53,361 --> 00:40:56,497
Ah, is that
what you think I do?

870
00:40:56,598 --> 00:40:58,266
Well, that's what
all secretaries do.

871
00:40:58,366 --> 00:40:59,634
That's what
they're supposed to do.

872
00:40:59,734 --> 00:41:02,937
I'm not all secretaries.

873
00:41:03,037 --> 00:41:04,038
No, you're not.

874
00:41:04,138 --> 00:41:06,107
No.

875
00:41:07,942 --> 00:41:09,711
Come work for me.

876
00:41:11,646 --> 00:41:15,650
Ah, for once,
she has nothing to say.

877
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:17,251
I work for Ruddy.
He works for me

878
00:41:17,351 --> 00:41:20,521
so technically
you already work for me.

879
00:41:20,622 --> 00:41:23,291
With all due respect, Charlie,

880
00:41:23,391 --> 00:41:25,393
I love where I am.

881
00:41:29,263 --> 00:41:31,900
They say movies are magic,

882
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,267
but they don't care
about magic.

883
00:41:33,367 --> 00:41:36,537
They care about money.

884
00:41:36,638 --> 00:41:38,973
And so do I.

885
00:41:42,744 --> 00:41:45,146
You're selling Paramount.

886
00:41:45,246 --> 00:41:48,583
I never said that.

887
00:41:48,683 --> 00:41:50,885
I like you, Bettye.

888
00:41:50,985 --> 00:41:54,122
Think about it.

889
00:41:54,222 --> 00:41:55,256
Who else knows?

890
00:41:55,356 --> 00:41:56,991
I assume the word
is already out.

891
00:41:57,091 --> 00:41:58,860
Did he say anything
about the movie?

892
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,995
Not exactly.

893
00:42:01,095 --> 00:42:03,765
You speak Charlie.
What did he say exactly?

894
00:42:08,002 --> 00:42:10,672
He offered me a job.

895
00:42:12,674 --> 00:42:13,775
I'll tell you
what they're doing, Peter.

896
00:42:13,875 --> 00:42:16,911
They are using my success
against me.

897
00:42:17,011 --> 00:42:19,047
Yeah.
Nothing's set in stone.

898
00:42:19,147 --> 00:42:20,682
They fought me tooth and nail.

899
00:42:20,782 --> 00:42:22,050
They told me not to make
"Love Story."

900
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:23,652
I put my balls on the line.

901
00:42:23,752 --> 00:42:24,853
I knew people wanted a romance.

902
00:42:24,953 --> 00:42:26,254
I knew that Ali was a star.

903
00:42:26,354 --> 00:42:27,989
I knew people would
fall in love with her.

904
00:42:28,089 --> 00:42:30,892
I fucking delivered
the biggest movie ever. Ever.

905
00:42:30,992 --> 00:42:33,161
And now they're taking
my baby away,

906
00:42:33,261 --> 00:42:34,829
selling her off
for spare parts?

907
00:42:34,929 --> 00:42:37,131
I don't think so.
Fuck that.

908
00:42:41,169 --> 00:42:43,872
What the fuck?

909
00:42:43,972 --> 00:42:45,874
Hey!

910
00:42:45,974 --> 00:42:47,776
Hey!

911
00:42:47,876 --> 00:42:49,310
What are you doing here?

912
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:52,613
We've got to work order to
map out the cemetery expansion.

913
00:42:52,714 --> 00:42:55,349
Get the fuck off my lot.

914
00:42:55,449 --> 00:42:56,651
Excuse me?

915
00:42:56,751 --> 00:43:00,221
I said
get the fuck off my lot!

916
00:43:00,321 --> 00:43:02,156
Hey, hey, hey.

917
00:43:02,256 --> 00:43:04,292
This is exactly what I said
was gonna happen.

918
00:43:04,392 --> 00:43:05,727
I heard you were

919
00:43:05,827 --> 00:43:06,961
asking Caesar
a lot of questions.

920
00:43:07,061 --> 00:43:08,196
No, no, Joe,

921
00:43:09,263 --> 00:43:10,031
- I was just curious about...
- Hey, look, Al,

922
00:43:10,999 --> 00:43:11,800
I don't like to talk business
over the phone.

923
00:43:12,433 --> 00:43:12,967
Come by the League office.

924
00:43:13,835 --> 00:43:14,368
We can talk about
whatever you want.

925
00:43:15,236 --> 00:43:15,704
Joe,
I'm a little busy right now.

926
00:43:16,437 --> 00:43:17,638
Great, I'll see you in an hour.

927
00:43:24,779 --> 00:43:26,815
I gotta go see him.
Hold down the fort.

928
00:43:26,915 --> 00:43:28,349
In the middle of all this?

929
00:43:28,449 --> 00:43:30,785
He called for me.
I gotta go.

930
00:43:30,885 --> 00:43:33,321
You sound like a gangster.

931
00:43:33,421 --> 00:43:34,923
Be back in an hour.

932
00:43:35,023 --> 00:43:37,658
If you're not, I'm gonna send
for your special agents.

933
00:43:37,759 --> 00:43:39,994
I'm sure they'll be around.

934
00:43:44,332 --> 00:43:47,335
Big day tomorrow.
You ready?

935
00:43:47,435 --> 00:43:48,669
Yeah, I'm just going over
the scene, like,

936
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:50,238
a million times in my head.

937
00:43:50,338 --> 00:43:51,339
Is the weather gonna be bad?

938
00:43:51,439 --> 00:43:53,708
Clear skies, 45 degrees.

939
00:43:53,808 --> 00:43:55,744
Perfect weather.

940
00:43:55,844 --> 00:43:57,979
I just can't believe
that it's actually

941
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,381
beginning tomorrow.
I know.

942
00:44:00,481 --> 00:44:01,449
You made it happen.

943
00:44:01,549 --> 00:44:02,784
We.

944
00:44:02,884 --> 00:44:05,053
We made it happen.

945
00:44:05,153 --> 00:44:07,388
It's a miracle.

946
00:44:07,488 --> 00:44:09,758
Everything that
we've been through.

947
00:44:11,092 --> 00:44:13,427
They said that
this was not going to succeed.

948
00:44:13,527 --> 00:44:15,163
They did.

949
00:44:15,263 --> 00:44:18,132
And now it's up to me
to make sure that it does.

950
00:44:18,232 --> 00:44:19,400
And it will.

951
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,302
And you're gonna
make it happen, Francis.

952
00:44:21,402 --> 00:44:23,137
It's gonna be great.

953
00:44:25,874 --> 00:44:28,276
Hey.
Good to see you, Al.

954
00:44:28,376 --> 00:44:31,880
Come on.
He's inside waiting for you.

955
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,915
And it's because
of courageous men

956
00:44:34,015 --> 00:44:35,884
like Congressman Biaggi,

957
00:44:35,984 --> 00:44:38,086
who's willing to fight
for Italian Americans,

958
00:44:38,186 --> 00:44:40,789
that we're able to make
any progress with civil rights.

959
00:44:40,889 --> 00:44:42,423
That's why the League
wholeheartedly

960
00:44:42,523 --> 00:44:43,992
throws its support

961
00:44:44,092 --> 00:44:46,494
behind the Congressman
for his re-election.

962
00:44:46,594 --> 00:44:51,032
Yes. Thank you, thank you.

963
00:44:51,132 --> 00:44:52,967
Oh, oh, oh.

964
00:44:53,067 --> 00:44:56,204
I'd also like to announce that

965
00:44:56,304 --> 00:44:59,507
after intense negotiations
with Gulf and Western,

966
00:44:59,607 --> 00:45:01,042
the League has decided
to allow them

967
00:45:01,142 --> 00:45:03,511
to make the movie,
"The Godfather."

968
00:45:03,611 --> 00:45:05,113
That's right.

969
00:45:05,213 --> 00:45:07,115
And I... and I should say

970
00:45:07,215 --> 00:45:09,884
that it's all because of this
man right there, Al Ruddy.

971
00:45:09,984 --> 00:45:12,753
Al, come up here. Come up here.
He's the film's producer.

972
00:45:12,854 --> 00:45:13,922
It's because of him
that we were able

973
00:45:14,022 --> 00:45:15,857
to come to this agreement.

974
00:45:15,957 --> 00:45:18,126
It was his brilliant idea
that Gulf and Western

975
00:45:18,226 --> 00:45:19,994
donate the proceeds
from the premiere

976
00:45:20,094 --> 00:45:21,863
to the League's hospital fund.

977
00:45:21,963 --> 00:45:23,898
We can't thank you enough, Al.

978
00:45:23,998 --> 00:45:25,934
This is the man
solely responsible

979
00:45:26,034 --> 00:45:27,969
for the alliance
between the Italian League,

980
00:45:28,069 --> 00:45:30,771
Gulf and Western,
and Paramount Pictures.

981
00:45:30,872 --> 00:45:32,273
You're one of us.

982
00:45:32,373 --> 00:45:33,975
Hey, come on, come up here.

983
00:45:34,075 --> 00:45:36,144
Come on, take a picture.

984
00:45:36,244 --> 00:45:37,545
How long have you
been working with Mr. Colombo?

985
00:45:37,645 --> 00:45:39,113
Come up. Come on.

986
00:45:39,213 --> 00:45:40,114
And what are the details

987
00:45:40,214 --> 00:45:41,415
of this financial relationship?

988
00:45:41,515 --> 00:45:42,917
Take a picture.
Take a picture.

989
00:45:43,017 --> 00:45:43,885
How does
Paramount Pictures feel

990
00:45:43,985 --> 00:45:45,419
about this, Mr. Ruddy?

991
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:47,255
Is it true that the
movie is still about the mafia?

992
00:45:47,355 --> 00:45:48,857
How does
Gulf and Western feel

993
00:45:48,957 --> 00:45:51,159
about being in business
with Joe Colombo?

994
00:47:08,269 --> 00:47:10,604
You're in bed with the mafia
for the whole world to see.

995
00:47:10,704 --> 00:47:12,240
I did what I had to do.

996
00:47:13,307 --> 00:47:15,176
They don't get it.
So make them get it.

997
00:47:15,276 --> 00:47:16,978
You try to say no
to Joe Colombo,

998
00:47:17,078 --> 00:47:18,312
let me know how that works out
for you.

999
00:47:18,412 --> 00:47:19,613
We cannot have another war.

1000
00:47:19,713 --> 00:47:21,515
You should have stayed
in prison.

1001
00:47:22,016 --> 00:47:23,417
It was safer for you there.

1002
00:47:23,717 --> 00:47:24,618
Action!

1003
00:47:24,718 --> 00:47:26,187
We know people want...

1004
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,089
violence...

1005
00:47:28,489 --> 00:47:30,091
Where's Ruddy?
Ruddy?

1006
00:47:31,892 --> 00:47:32,660
It wasn't personal,
it was business.

1007
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,128
Just business, huh?

1008
00:47:34,228 --> 00:47:36,664
Unfortunate things
present opportunities.

1009
00:47:37,531 --> 00:47:39,100
Sometimes it is personal.

1010
00:47:46,307 --> 00:47:50,411
Ladies and gentlemen, may I
have your attention please?

1011
00:47:50,678 --> 00:47:52,480
The Patsy's cast dinner.

1012
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,015
It's just a favorite
scene of mine.

1013
00:47:54,115 --> 00:47:55,116
It's a great scene.

1014
00:47:56,217 --> 00:47:59,988
Coppola had a dinner at
Patsy's for the Corleone cast.

1015
00:48:00,088 --> 00:48:01,689
I just thought it would
be really nice to have

1016
00:48:02,356 --> 00:48:05,159
the Corleone family
come together
for a real Italian dinner.

1017
00:48:05,259 --> 00:48:06,294
And he didn't tell them

1018
00:48:06,394 --> 00:48:07,695
to play their
characters or anything.

1019
00:48:07,795 --> 00:48:09,063
He just wanted to
have a nice dinner

1020
00:48:10,298 --> 00:48:10,999
with all the main characters
before they started shooting.

1021
00:48:11,966 --> 00:48:15,236
Bringing all of
these actors together

1022
00:48:15,336 --> 00:48:20,108
allowed for a subtle
alchemy to be present.

1023
00:48:20,208 --> 00:48:23,411
And at that dinner they
all started, weirdly,

1024
00:48:23,511 --> 00:48:25,013
assuming their parts.

1025
00:48:25,113 --> 00:48:26,480
Let's eat.
Mangia.

1026
00:48:31,352 --> 00:48:33,454
Talia Shire started
bringing platters over

1027
00:48:33,654 --> 00:48:34,955
to serve the table.

1028
00:48:35,056 --> 00:48:36,190
I'm not the head of this family.

1029
00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:38,026
Brando sat at
the head of the table.

1030
00:48:38,126 --> 00:48:39,627
No, no.
Your mother first, always.

1031
00:48:39,727 --> 00:48:41,329
The three sons started to jockey

1032
00:48:41,429 --> 00:48:43,064
for position to
sit next to Brando.

1033
00:48:43,164 --> 00:48:44,365
You get any eggplant?

1034
00:48:44,465 --> 00:48:45,166
No.

1035
00:48:46,334 --> 00:48:47,101
Well, you gotta try some.
You want me to get you some?

1036
00:48:47,935 --> 00:48:48,569
I think that this was the place

1037
00:48:49,403 --> 00:48:51,372
where the Corleone
family was born.

1038
00:48:51,472 --> 00:48:53,507
I appreciate having
the whole family together

1039
00:48:53,607 --> 00:48:54,475
for my birthday.

1040
00:48:55,343 --> 00:48:56,210
It's just a really great scene,

1041
00:48:57,211 --> 00:48:58,646
A great idea, to show
them being loose with it.

1042
00:48:58,746 --> 00:49:00,248
To show the family
becoming a family.

1043
00:49:00,348 --> 00:49:02,183
What's right here
is what's important.

1044
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:03,551
Family.

1045
00:49:04,418 --> 00:49:05,386
There was a very
delicate balance

1046
00:49:06,254 --> 00:49:08,656
to allowing these
people to come to life

1047
00:49:08,756 --> 00:49:12,260
in a way where we began to see

1048
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,562
not Al Pacino but
Michael Corleone.

1049
00:49:15,163 --> 00:49:18,066
You know what
the name Corleone means?
Heart of a lion.

1050
00:49:18,166 --> 00:49:20,000
Not Jimmy Caan, but Sonny.

1051
00:49:20,101 --> 00:49:21,435
The douche bag has arrived.

1052
00:49:21,535 --> 00:49:23,104
There was
something about that dinner

1053
00:49:23,204 --> 00:49:24,405
that always stood out to us

1054
00:49:25,506 --> 00:49:27,541
because you could see Coppola
and Ruddy sitting there

1055
00:49:27,641 --> 00:49:31,045
watching the dynamics of
the Corleone family play out

1056
00:49:31,145 --> 00:49:33,081
and understand that they
had something special.

1057
00:49:33,181 --> 00:49:34,415
You know what I'm thinking?

1058
00:49:34,748 --> 00:49:36,350
This is gonna be a great film.

1059
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:38,686
- Yeah!
- Thank you, everybody.

1060
00:49:42,456 --> 00:49:45,059
You told me, do whatever it
takes to get my movie made.

1061
00:49:45,159 --> 00:49:46,727
You said to color
outside the lines.

1062
00:49:46,827 --> 00:49:48,462
I never told you
to fuck me over.

1063
00:49:48,562 --> 00:49:51,599
From Bob's standpoint,
he wanted a star.

1064
00:49:51,699 --> 00:49:53,167
He's like,
"I don't like Pacino!"

1065
00:49:53,467 --> 00:49:56,070
Ruddy goes to
Bluhdorn behind his back

1066
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:58,072
and says, "We need Al Pacino."

1067
00:49:58,172 --> 00:49:59,440
I'm gonna make you an offer.

1068
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:01,742
It was just brutally
difficult, but he had to do it.

1069
00:50:01,842 --> 00:50:04,645
He didn't want this
unheard of kid.

1070
00:50:04,745 --> 00:50:05,779
He already had Brando.

1071
00:50:06,814 --> 00:50:07,781
He's like, you know, it
was already exacerbating

1072
00:50:08,449 --> 00:50:09,383
going into a land of chaos.

1073
00:50:10,518 --> 00:50:12,220
But I suppose the sort of
Shakespearean part of that is

1074
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,621
he felt like he'd been
stabbed in the back.

1075
00:50:13,721 --> 00:50:15,789
It was a sort of a Julius Caesar
moment for him.

1076
00:50:15,889 --> 00:50:17,558
It was for the
good of the movie.

1077
00:50:17,658 --> 00:50:20,094
Then his sort
of major confidante was Ali.

1078
00:50:20,428 --> 00:50:24,165
I love working with Matthew.
It's really no acting necessary.

1079
00:50:24,265 --> 00:50:26,267
He is a consummate pro.

1080
00:50:26,367 --> 00:50:27,535
I think I'm doing both
of us a favor.

1081
00:50:27,635 --> 00:50:31,372
Watching Matthew create
organically, take to take,

1082
00:50:31,472 --> 00:50:33,307
and his incredible range
as an actor,

1083
00:50:33,407 --> 00:50:35,776
but also having all of that
range fit so beautifully

1084
00:50:35,876 --> 00:50:37,111
inside of Robert Evans.

1085
00:50:37,311 --> 00:50:39,180
It's not good enough for you Al

1086
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,415
and I really don't have
time for this right now.

1087
00:50:41,515 --> 00:50:43,351
So dependable
as a scene partner.

1088
00:50:43,451 --> 00:50:47,455
Working with him did feel
like I was always being held.

1089
00:50:47,555 --> 00:50:48,422
I'm going to do it.

1090
00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:50,458
He goes and watches
The Panic in Needle Park

1091
00:50:51,159 --> 00:50:51,859
and he sits in there with Ali.

1092
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:53,461
Pacino doesn't
have to say a word

1093
00:50:54,262 --> 00:50:55,196
and I can't take
my eyes off him.

1094
00:50:56,764 --> 00:50:59,099
In the end, he's like, "Well,
he is actually really good,
this guy."

1095
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,701
Which is wonderful, and then...

1096
00:51:00,801 --> 00:51:01,869
Listen to me.

1097
00:51:01,969 --> 00:51:04,672
You're still a putz,
but I got Pacino.

1098
00:51:04,772 --> 00:51:06,174
He's in the picture.
