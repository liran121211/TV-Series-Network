1
00:00:03,351 --> 00:00:05,048
Lenny was a little
on edge today.

2
00:00:05,092 --> 00:00:06,702
He was saying something
about Joe Gallo.

3
00:00:06,745 --> 00:00:08,878
Are you worried about me? Yeah, maybe.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,753
How is he? I don't know.

5
00:00:14,797 --> 00:00:16,712
I'm gonna go see him
at the hospital later.

6
00:00:16,755 --> 00:00:18,844
Do you really think
you should be doing that?

7
00:00:18,888 --> 00:00:21,673
No. I can't not go.

8
00:00:21,717 --> 00:00:23,023
Look, we got a problem.

9
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:25,373
Bluhdorn and Lapidus saw dailies

10
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:27,679
of Pacino's first day,
and they want to fire him.

11
00:00:27,723 --> 00:00:29,681
Barry's a fucking rat
who's always wanted my job,

12
00:00:29,725 --> 00:00:31,205
and this is part
of his power grab.

13
00:00:31,248 --> 00:00:33,033
I'm Joe Gallo,

14
00:00:33,076 --> 00:00:34,599
and I'm in charge
of your movie now.

15
00:00:34,643 --> 00:00:37,602
Whatever you were giving
Colombo, you now give to me.

16
00:00:37,646 --> 00:00:39,213
Fuck Sicily.

17
00:00:39,256 --> 00:00:40,953
Give Gallo the money.

18
00:00:40,997 --> 00:00:42,540
Without Sicily,
it doesn't live or breathe.

19
00:00:42,564 --> 00:00:43,695
I'm begging you.

20
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:46,568
I can't find the money.

21
00:00:46,611 --> 00:00:48,178
I don't know
what's going on with you

22
00:00:48,222 --> 00:00:49,764
or you and Ali
or whatever happened to you...

23
00:00:49,788 --> 00:00:51,790
My marriage is none
of your fucking business.

24
00:00:51,834 --> 00:00:53,994
Ever since then, you haven't
been the Bob Evans I know.

25
00:01:01,974 --> 00:01:03,802
Joe Colombo says goodbye,
fuckhead.

26
00:01:05,587 --> 00:01:07,719
You can cross one thing
off your list.

27
00:01:07,763 --> 00:01:08,851
You don't have to worry

28
00:01:08,894 --> 00:01:10,133
about that
fucking psychopath anymore.

29
00:01:10,157 --> 00:01:12,376
We're going to Sicily, baby.

30
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,031
We're going. You son of a bitch!

31
00:02:55,262 --> 00:02:56,262
Grazie.

32
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,793
Okay, we should be
getting close to Corleone.

33
00:03:04,836 --> 00:03:06,490
How many more miles?

34
00:03:06,534 --> 00:03:08,840
I don't know.
It's in kilometers.

35
00:03:08,884 --> 00:03:10,799
You used to work at Rand.

36
00:03:10,842 --> 00:03:13,149
You can't convert that?

37
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,238
We're a half inch away.
How's that?

38
00:03:17,545 --> 00:03:19,262
You know what my grandfather,
Francesco Penino,

39
00:03:19,286 --> 00:03:20,896
once told me about Italy?

40
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:23,942
I bet we're gonna find out.

41
00:03:23,986 --> 00:03:26,118
He was a composer.

42
00:03:26,162 --> 00:03:29,034
And he told me that
when he emigrated to America

43
00:03:29,078 --> 00:03:30,558
that he missed home like crazy.

44
00:03:30,601 --> 00:03:33,125
And when he finally
got to come back,

45
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:35,867
it was like picking up
an old, beloved instrument

46
00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:37,782
that he hadn't played
in a really long time.

47
00:03:37,826 --> 00:03:39,697
Yeah, at first it was
a little out of tune,

48
00:03:39,741 --> 00:03:42,222
but then
when he started playing it,

49
00:03:42,265 --> 00:03:44,963
all the notes became
familiar again.

50
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,359
For me, it's like I'm...

51
00:03:49,403 --> 00:03:52,275
I'm hearing these notes
for the first time.

52
00:04:26,309 --> 00:04:28,311
Would've been nice
to take a shower.

53
00:04:28,355 --> 00:04:30,400
Well, our Italian AD
said to meet him here,

54
00:04:30,444 --> 00:04:31,923
so we may as well eat.

55
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:34,186
Okay.

56
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,927
My friends, ciao!

57
00:04:35,971 --> 00:04:39,409
You must be Tony. Yes, I'm your AD.

58
00:04:39,453 --> 00:04:41,237
I'm Al.
This is the gang.

59
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,543
Oh, my God, che bello.

60
00:04:42,586 --> 00:04:44,216
What a beautiful group
on a beautiful day.

61
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,870
You came on the right day,
because it's today.

62
00:04:45,894 --> 00:04:47,287
Okay, you guys want anti-pasta?

63
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,810
Grazie, grazie.

64
00:04:50,942 --> 00:04:52,466
Wow! Whatever you like, please.

65
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:55,469
Exactly how I pictured it.
TONY: I take as a compliment.

66
00:04:55,512 --> 00:04:56,992
Table for kings.
Look at this.

67
00:04:57,035 --> 00:04:59,299
Mr. Coppola, sit.

68
00:04:59,342 --> 00:05:00,517
Nice to meet you.

69
00:05:00,561 --> 00:05:01,823
Yeah.

70
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:02,930
Thank you so much. All right, please.

71
00:05:02,954 --> 00:05:04,260
Wow.

72
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,827
Can't believe
we're actually here.

73
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,132
I know. Don't jinx it.

74
00:05:09,221 --> 00:05:12,355
Hey, have you heard at all
from Evans?

75
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:14,618
Since the circus act
he pulled at the wrap party?

76
00:05:14,662 --> 00:05:16,881
No, I haven't.Mm.

77
00:05:16,925 --> 00:05:19,493
You gonna call him?

78
00:05:19,536 --> 00:05:21,669
Have some eggplant, Bettye.
You look hungry.

79
00:05:21,712 --> 00:05:26,108
So how are you planning
to light the exteriors?

80
00:05:26,151 --> 00:05:28,893
You know that big ball
of burning plasma in the sky?

81
00:05:28,937 --> 00:05:30,721
No. Oh, the... the sun?

82
00:05:30,765 --> 00:05:32,810
Yeah, that's the one.

83
00:05:32,854 --> 00:05:34,290
Yeah, go fuck yourself.

84
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,161
This Anisette,
this is so smooth.

85
00:05:36,205 --> 00:05:38,076
Al, what do you think? Oh, it's fantastic.

86
00:05:39,034 --> 00:05:41,863
Scusi, how do you make it?

87
00:05:41,906 --> 00:05:45,127
Um, come si prepare?

88
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,869
Eh, local secret.

89
00:05:47,912 --> 00:05:49,871
Um, I make my own,

90
00:05:49,914 --> 00:05:53,788
but this... I... when I'm...

91
00:05:56,007 --> 00:05:57,400
I think he...
I think he likes you.

92
00:05:59,794 --> 00:06:02,449
Al, Al, let me introduce you
to our friend, Bruno.

93
00:06:02,492 --> 00:06:04,842
Oh, okay. Excuse me, excuse me.

94
00:06:04,886 --> 00:06:06,453
This is Bruno, okay.

95
00:06:06,496 --> 00:06:09,020
Now, he's made sure
everything will go smoothly,

96
00:06:09,064 --> 00:06:11,501
and he's assured us that
no permits will be necessary.

97
00:06:11,545 --> 00:06:13,590
Oh, that's very kind
of you, Bruno.

98
00:06:13,634 --> 00:06:15,113
We appreciate it.

99
00:06:15,157 --> 00:06:16,637
Please thank him
for his generosity.

100
00:06:26,298 --> 00:06:29,258
Bruno would like for you
to come see him tomorrow.

101
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:30,477
Oh.

102
00:06:31,565 --> 00:06:32,914
Capisce?

103
00:06:34,785 --> 00:06:37,266
Okay. Yeah?

104
00:06:39,181 --> 00:06:41,575
Mangia, mangia, mangia.
Eat, eat, eat.

105
00:06:41,618 --> 00:06:43,403
Grazie. FRANCIS: Grazie mille.

106
00:06:46,493 --> 00:06:48,451
Uh, Tony.

107
00:06:48,495 --> 00:06:51,759
Is Bruno by any chance, uh...

108
00:06:51,802 --> 00:06:53,761
mafia?

109
00:06:53,804 --> 00:06:56,067
Si, Cosa Nostra.

110
00:06:56,111 --> 00:06:58,592
They run everything here.Okay.

111
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,689
You okay?

112
00:07:08,732 --> 00:07:10,386
We need to get out of here.

113
00:07:14,956 --> 00:07:16,784
Why are we leaving?

114
00:07:16,827 --> 00:07:19,656
This is like home. Trust me, it's not.

115
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,591
Well, would you please tell me
what happened back there?

116
00:07:21,615 --> 00:07:23,965
Yeah, the mafia happened
back there.

117
00:07:24,008 --> 00:07:26,402
The fucking Cosa Nostra, buddy.
The real fucking thing.

118
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,621
Well, so what?

119
00:07:27,664 --> 00:07:29,294
You dealt with the mafia
back in New York,

120
00:07:29,318 --> 00:07:30,513
and you lived to tell the tale.

121
00:07:30,537 --> 00:07:31,992
Yeah, and I'd like
to keep it that way.

122
00:07:32,016 --> 00:07:33,670
Hey, at least
the food was good, huh?

123
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,631
Wait, there was actually...

124
00:07:37,674 --> 00:07:39,676
There was a town that we saw
on the scout

125
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,809
that would work perfectly.

126
00:07:41,852 --> 00:07:44,507
Uh, Taro...
Taormina? Taormina?

127
00:07:44,551 --> 00:07:46,117
Yes, Taormina. TAVOULARIS: Taormina?

128
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:47,510
Taormina is beautiful.

129
00:07:47,554 --> 00:07:50,252
Is the Cosa Nostra in Taormina?

130
00:07:50,295 --> 00:07:51,775
No, not so much there.

131
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:53,342
Is near the airport.

132
00:07:53,385 --> 00:07:55,387
The airport. Great.

133
00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:57,627
We just flew halfway around
the world to shoot in Burbank.

134
00:07:57,651 --> 00:08:00,480
Wow, Bob's Big Boy.

135
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,111
Yes, I understand that.
We'll have to circle back

136
00:08:04,135 --> 00:08:06,268
around on that because...
I'm sorry.

137
00:08:06,311 --> 00:08:08,705
Mr. Lapidus,
he's not in right now.

138
00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:10,577
And when will you be
expecting him back?

139
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,883
I'm not sure, but I will
have him get right back to you.

140
00:08:14,798 --> 00:08:15,973
Uh...

141
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:19,673
I'll have to call you
right back.

142
00:08:21,588 --> 00:08:24,329
Sheila, can you do a deal memo

143
00:08:24,373 --> 00:08:25,829
for Alvin Sargent
to write the adaptation

144
00:08:25,853 --> 00:08:27,507
of the book "Addie Pray"?

145
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,291
Um, don't you want to call
Business Affairs?

146
00:08:29,334 --> 00:08:31,075
I want it to come
from this office.

147
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:33,121
I thought you would've had
enough of authors

148
00:08:33,164 --> 00:08:34,272
writing their own screenplays.

149
00:08:34,296 --> 00:08:36,820
Barry!

150
00:08:36,864 --> 00:08:38,735
Uh, uh, when did you get in?

151
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:39,780
Come in.

152
00:08:41,695 --> 00:08:43,261
Right.

153
00:08:43,305 --> 00:08:44,915
Close the door.

154
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,047
Sure.

155
00:08:48,223 --> 00:08:50,530
So, you know, Alvin Sargent

156
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:51,724
actually didn't write
"Addie Pray."

157
00:08:51,748 --> 00:08:53,968
It was... Where the fuck is Evans?

158
00:08:54,011 --> 00:08:55,883
He's not in. No shit.

159
00:08:55,926 --> 00:08:58,973
Yeah. Um, he's got
a really bad back.

160
00:08:59,016 --> 00:09:00,409
Sciatica.

161
00:09:00,452 --> 00:09:02,846
So, um, he's working from home.

162
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,413
Ah, I see. Okay.

163
00:09:04,456 --> 00:09:07,503
Well, in that case, he won't
mind if I use his office.

164
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,070
I'm sure that's fine.

165
00:09:09,113 --> 00:09:11,289
Yeah, I'm sure it is, too.

166
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,596
Listen, Peter...

167
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,468
I want to have a meeting
with you and go over our slate.

168
00:09:16,512 --> 00:09:19,254
Everything in production,
development, everything.

169
00:09:19,297 --> 00:09:21,386
Got it?

170
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,431
Mm-hmm.

171
00:09:22,474 --> 00:09:24,607
Great.Great.

172
00:10:03,124 --> 00:10:04,560
Oh.

173
00:10:07,084 --> 00:10:09,652
This is even better
than Corleone.

174
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:14,657
Uh, yeah, I think I finally
agree with you there, Francis.

175
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:16,243
Francis, you know,
this could be perfect

176
00:10:16,267 --> 00:10:17,573
for Don Tommasino's estate.

177
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,227
I know. Yeah?

178
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,795
The whole feel is just spot-on.

179
00:10:21,838 --> 00:10:23,642
Francis, this entire hillside
gets amazing light.

180
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:24,730
Ooh, you know what we could do?

181
00:10:24,754 --> 00:10:26,103
This could be
our opening, right?

182
00:10:26,147 --> 00:10:28,018
Do, like, an overhead shot.

183
00:10:30,194 --> 00:10:31,587
Espresso?

184
00:10:38,289 --> 00:10:40,857
Grazie mille.

185
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:46,036
There we go.

186
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,473
This place looks great.
RUDDY: Yeah, it's nice.

187
00:10:48,517 --> 00:10:50,040
Very authentic, right? BETTYE: Yeah.

188
00:10:56,046 --> 00:10:57,569
Buongiorno. Buongiorno.

189
00:10:57,613 --> 00:10:59,223
Two coffees, please.

190
00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:01,748
Due espressi, per favore.

191
00:11:04,925 --> 00:11:07,449
You've been holding back on me.

192
00:11:07,492 --> 00:11:08,885
I've picked up some phrases.

193
00:11:08,929 --> 00:11:10,539
When in Rome, right?

194
00:11:10,582 --> 00:11:12,715
Yeah, we're not in Rome. Close enough.

195
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:14,021
Give me your money.

196
00:11:17,328 --> 00:11:18,958
You know what I'm thinking?
You're a funny guy.

197
00:11:18,982 --> 00:11:20,767
This would be a great location

198
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:23,508
for when Michael meets
Apollonia's father.

199
00:11:23,552 --> 00:11:24,988
Oh, yeah.

200
00:11:25,032 --> 00:11:27,861
Excuse me.
Uh, are you the owner?

201
00:11:27,904 --> 00:11:30,820
Okay.

202
00:11:30,864 --> 00:11:33,214
We'd like to have
a conversation with the owner.

203
00:11:33,257 --> 00:11:34,781
Grazie.

204
00:11:34,824 --> 00:11:37,218
What did he just say?

205
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:39,742
Something in Italian.

206
00:11:39,786 --> 00:11:41,918
So you have selective Italian?

207
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:48,098
I'm Angelo, his son.Angelo.

208
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:49,143
Al.

209
00:11:49,186 --> 00:11:50,710
This is Francis...

210
00:11:55,323 --> 00:11:57,281
Bettye.

211
00:11:57,325 --> 00:11:59,327
Bettye.

212
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:00,763
Great.

213
00:12:00,807 --> 00:12:03,418
So, Angelo, we're in town.
We're filming a movie.

214
00:12:03,461 --> 00:12:06,726
We'd love to use
your restaurant as a location.

215
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:08,640
We'd like to film here.

216
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:24,439
50,000 lira.

217
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:31,576
Si.

218
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,882
What?

219
00:12:32,926 --> 00:12:35,015
Al, are you sure
we can afford that?

220
00:12:35,058 --> 00:12:36,886
Who's bad
with conversions now, Bettye?

221
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,975
50,000 lira's like 35 bucks.

222
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:40,498
Come on.
Andiamo.

223
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:42,215
Can I show you what
we're planning for tomorrow?

224
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:43,588
Yeah. Grazie.

225
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:46,766
Grazie.

226
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:48,071
I'll be back in a little bit.

227
00:12:48,115 --> 00:12:50,595
Thank you.

228
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,946
Also, I need your help
casting tomorrow.

229
00:12:52,989 --> 00:12:54,121
Casting? Yeah.

230
00:12:54,164 --> 00:12:55,339
What?

231
00:12:55,383 --> 00:12:56,776
Oh!

232
00:13:00,214 --> 00:13:01,302
Thank you so much.

233
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:06,350
I ordered a coffee.

234
00:13:06,394 --> 00:13:09,049
Ah, you don't need
so much water.

235
00:13:09,092 --> 00:13:12,530
This is better, piu Siciliano.

236
00:13:15,882 --> 00:13:18,058
Ooh, yeah.

237
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:19,929
Everything is better
in Italy, huh?

238
00:13:21,365 --> 00:13:24,716
So did you like
any actresses so far?

239
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,980
Well, in the script,

240
00:13:27,023 --> 00:13:30,766
they describe Apollonia
as a thunderbolt.

241
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,813
When Michael sees her,
he immediately falls in love.

242
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:36,250
You saw a lot
of beautiful girls,

243
00:13:36,293 --> 00:13:37,947
and I'd like to love
all of them.

244
00:13:37,991 --> 00:13:41,037
Yeah.

245
00:13:41,081 --> 00:13:42,909
But it's more than that.

246
00:13:42,952 --> 00:13:45,085
It's about
how she makes you feel.

247
00:13:45,128 --> 00:13:48,740
Not just her beauty,
but the way she looks at you.

248
00:13:48,784 --> 00:13:50,220
Scusi.

249
00:13:58,968 --> 00:14:00,709
Sorry, I don't speak
much Italian,

250
00:14:00,752 --> 00:14:03,277
and, uh, you just broke
my translator.

251
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,279
Do you speak any English?

252
00:14:05,322 --> 00:14:08,499
Yes, I-I think so.

253
00:14:08,543 --> 00:14:11,633
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,

254
00:14:11,676 --> 00:14:15,115
Thursday, Friday.

255
00:14:15,158 --> 00:14:17,682
Come ti chiami?

256
00:14:17,726 --> 00:14:18,945
Simonetta.

257
00:14:21,425 --> 00:14:23,340
So... so the dark ones...

258
00:14:23,384 --> 00:14:26,256
They've just been
on the tree longer.

259
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,060
They've been there longer
than the younger ones.

260
00:14:28,084 --> 00:14:30,260
More for me?
Thank you so much.

261
00:14:30,304 --> 00:14:31,871
It's really the... hey, no,

262
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:33,196
you're gonna fill up
on the bread,

263
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,545
and you're gonna ruin
your appetite.

264
00:14:34,569 --> 00:14:35,700
What are you, my mother?

265
00:14:35,744 --> 00:14:37,050
Let's hope
for your mother's sake

266
00:14:37,093 --> 00:14:38,486
she doesn't look
anything like him.

267
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:39,966
Yeah, right?

268
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:41,837
Al, can I steal you
for a second?

269
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,056
Yeah.

270
00:14:45,623 --> 00:14:48,017
You don't want it?

271
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:51,194
We have a problem.

272
00:14:51,238 --> 00:14:52,456
Another one? Yeah.

273
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,242
Okay, big or small?

274
00:14:55,285 --> 00:14:56,852
Evans is out.

275
00:14:59,028 --> 00:15:01,204
What? What do you mean?
Bluhdorn is going to fire him.

276
00:15:03,554 --> 00:15:04,686
How do you know this?

277
00:15:04,729 --> 00:15:06,340
Because I just got off the phone

278
00:15:06,383 --> 00:15:07,645
with Bluhdhorn's secretary.

279
00:15:10,474 --> 00:15:12,172
Does Bob know?

280
00:15:12,215 --> 00:15:15,044
It hasn't happened yet,
because no one has seen him.

281
00:15:15,088 --> 00:15:17,090
He hasn't been
in the office in days.

282
00:15:17,133 --> 00:15:19,048
Fuck.

283
00:15:20,832 --> 00:15:22,356
This movie's like a Hydra.

284
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,272
You cut the head off one,
and just another one pops up.

285
00:15:25,315 --> 00:15:27,361
Fuck.

286
00:15:27,404 --> 00:15:30,190
Hey, what do we do?

287
00:15:30,233 --> 00:15:32,061
I mean, I should let him
twist in the wind

288
00:15:32,105 --> 00:15:33,933
for what he said to me.

289
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:35,543
But you're not going to,

290
00:15:35,586 --> 00:15:37,173
because he is
single-handedly responsible

291
00:15:37,197 --> 00:15:38,285
for giving you your shot.

292
00:15:38,328 --> 00:15:39,590
It's because we need Bob

293
00:15:39,634 --> 00:15:41,679
to finish this movie
the right way.

294
00:15:43,681 --> 00:15:45,553
All right, book us two flights

295
00:15:45,596 --> 00:15:47,207
back to New York tomorrow.

296
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,730
We'll head back
after the car stunt

297
00:15:48,773 --> 00:15:50,688
and let Francis finish the rest.

298
00:15:50,732 --> 00:15:51,732
Okay.

299
00:15:57,521 --> 00:15:58,783
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

300
00:15:58,827 --> 00:16:00,698
And just the reaction
is just perfect.

301
00:16:00,742 --> 00:16:04,398
Go find some place to be safe,
all right?

302
00:16:04,441 --> 00:16:06,966
Keep an eye out.
How's he doing?

303
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:13,015
Gino? Bene?

304
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:14,974
Si, si. Bene.

305
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:17,106
Okay, we're ready! Okay.

306
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,803
He understands
we only have the funds

307
00:16:18,847 --> 00:16:19,998
for one shot
of blowing this thing up?

308
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:22,155
Oh, yes. I made sure. One shot.

309
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:24,026
Yeah, he know.
I make sure to tell him.

310
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:27,290
Okay, everybody, please.
Silenzio!

311
00:16:27,334 --> 00:16:28,813
We have one shot to do this,

312
00:16:28,857 --> 00:16:31,164
so everybody in final positions.

313
00:16:36,691 --> 00:16:39,563
Good luck.
Buona fortuna.

314
00:16:39,607 --> 00:16:40,738
Grazie.

315
00:16:42,871 --> 00:16:43,871
We're rolling.

316
00:16:45,134 --> 00:16:48,137
Ready? And set.

317
00:16:50,705 --> 00:16:52,620
Azione!

318
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:03,631
What happened?

319
00:17:17,775 --> 00:17:19,908
You get it?

320
00:17:24,608 --> 00:17:26,523
Is everybody okay?

321
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:28,395
All right, look.
Okay, listen, I'll handle it.

322
00:17:28,438 --> 00:17:29,758
We didn't mean for that
to happen.

323
00:17:29,787 --> 00:17:32,225
We'll pay for the window.

324
00:17:32,268 --> 00:17:35,489
Shit, you know?
Sorry, sorry, scusi.

325
00:17:35,532 --> 00:17:36,664
Al.We'll pay for it.

326
00:17:36,707 --> 00:17:38,144
Yeah? Airport.

327
00:17:38,187 --> 00:17:39,710
Airport. Let's go.

328
00:17:39,754 --> 00:17:41,538
You got it? Okay, all right.

329
00:17:41,582 --> 00:17:42,733
You're eyebrow's on fire.Yeah.

330
00:17:42,757 --> 00:17:44,585
What?

331
00:17:47,588 --> 00:17:48,850
Yeah!

332
00:17:50,373 --> 00:17:51,722
You can't fire him.

333
00:17:51,766 --> 00:17:53,594
Well, then what am
I supposed to do with him?

334
00:17:53,637 --> 00:17:54,986
He's a lame horse.

335
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,529
And you know what you do
with a lame horse?

336
00:17:56,553 --> 00:17:59,556
Bob Evans is the only reason
that Paramount still exists.

337
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,862
Well, then where is he?

338
00:18:00,905 --> 00:18:02,603
He's supposed to be
running a studio.

339
00:18:02,646 --> 00:18:04,561
I know you Hollywood idiots
think that

340
00:18:04,605 --> 00:18:06,191
it's all make-believe,
but it's still a business.

341
00:18:06,215 --> 00:18:08,478
Nobody understands this
business better than he does.

342
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:10,567
And it doesn't matter
if he's missing in action.

343
00:18:10,611 --> 00:18:12,482
A business does not run itself.

344
00:18:12,526 --> 00:18:15,703
Charlie, show some
fucking decency, would you?

345
00:18:15,746 --> 00:18:17,574
The guy's given his blood
for your company.

346
00:18:17,618 --> 00:18:19,228
I gave my blood for him!

347
00:18:21,012 --> 00:18:22,666
God damn it!

348
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,644
Everyone told me that
he didn't have what it takes.

349
00:18:24,668 --> 00:18:26,322
Everyone!

350
00:18:26,366 --> 00:18:28,759
But I saw something in him,
and I believed in him,

351
00:18:28,803 --> 00:18:31,110
and I chose to bet on him.

352
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,069
It was a good bet.

353
00:18:37,377 --> 00:18:41,120
He's meshugana,
and he's just crazy enough

354
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:43,644
to make you believe
his line of bullshit.

355
00:18:45,863 --> 00:18:49,389
He's got that thing, you know?

356
00:18:49,432 --> 00:18:52,305
It just... it draws you in.

357
00:18:52,348 --> 00:18:54,045
Charisma.

358
00:18:55,395 --> 00:18:57,658
But it's gone now, Ruddy...

359
00:18:57,701 --> 00:19:00,139
that spark.

360
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:03,881
And I have responsibilities.

361
00:19:03,925 --> 00:19:07,668
I cannot have a drug addict
running my company.

362
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:13,456
Lapidus is in LA
to look out for things.

363
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,284
He's in charge for now.

364
00:19:21,247 --> 00:19:24,119
Let me talk to Bob.

365
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,687
Without him,
this movie won't succeed.

366
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,645
And after everything
he's done for the company,

367
00:19:28,689 --> 00:19:32,127
at the very least,
that deserves a meeting.

368
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,129
But that window is closing fast.

369
00:19:39,265 --> 00:19:41,876
I'm gonna talk to him.

370
00:19:50,928 --> 00:19:53,148
All right, should we start
with the development slate?

371
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,890
Yeah. Yeah?

372
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:57,718
Okay.

373
00:19:57,761 --> 00:20:00,895
So, as you can see,

374
00:20:00,938 --> 00:20:02,940
we got quite a list here... "Great Gatsby."

375
00:20:02,984 --> 00:20:04,159
Yeah. I love that book.

376
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,901
Reminded me of my father.

377
00:20:06,944 --> 00:20:10,339
Uh, what is this?
Uh, the "Save the Tiger"?

378
00:20:10,383 --> 00:20:11,862
What tiger? What is this? Yeah.

379
00:20:11,906 --> 00:20:14,474
That's based on a novel
by Steve Shagan.

380
00:20:14,517 --> 00:20:15,866
We optioned the galleys.

381
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:16,867
It hasn't been published yet,

382
00:20:16,911 --> 00:20:18,391
but it's
a great character study.

383
00:20:18,434 --> 00:20:20,610
This... this man
with an apparel company

384
00:20:20,654 --> 00:20:22,133
who can't keep it afloat,

385
00:20:22,177 --> 00:20:24,005
and he's going down
a dark rabbit hole.

386
00:20:24,048 --> 00:20:25,659
Stop right there.

387
00:20:25,702 --> 00:20:27,878
Who the hell wants to see that?

388
00:20:27,922 --> 00:20:31,099
Barry, this is
a prestige project.

389
00:20:31,142 --> 00:20:33,667
I guess Evans misses
lady's apparel after all.

390
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,495
You do know that we are

391
00:20:35,538 --> 00:20:38,454
in the entertainment
business, right?

392
00:20:38,498 --> 00:20:40,239
There's more to it than that.

393
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:42,371
Oh, and this,
no, no, no, no, no.

394
00:20:42,415 --> 00:20:44,243
"Chinatown," no.

395
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:45,461
What?

396
00:20:47,898 --> 00:20:49,552
I'm... I'm sorry.

397
00:20:49,596 --> 00:20:51,728
That's a...
That's a really great script.

398
00:20:51,772 --> 00:20:53,991
Um, inspired by real events.

399
00:20:54,035 --> 00:20:57,386
Yeah, water, I get it.
I heard Evans' pitch, right?

400
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,953
Dump it.

401
00:20:58,996 --> 00:21:00,084
Dump it?

402
00:21:00,128 --> 00:21:01,347
Sell it.

403
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,305
Or we'll have to take
a loss on it.

404
00:21:03,349 --> 00:21:07,178
We should be making what
the people want to see, right?

405
00:21:07,222 --> 00:21:10,007
"Airport,"
a thriller in the sky.

406
00:21:10,051 --> 00:21:11,618
"M.A.S.H.," funny doctors.

407
00:21:11,661 --> 00:21:13,402
Again, entertainment.

408
00:21:15,361 --> 00:21:18,407
I'm sorry, Barry, um...

409
00:21:18,451 --> 00:21:21,323
"Chinatown" can really be
something.

410
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:23,412
You know, uh, uh,
Nicholson's attached.

411
00:21:23,456 --> 00:21:25,501
It does not matter who is in it

412
00:21:25,545 --> 00:21:29,897
if it's another dark,
confusing piece, but go ahead,

413
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,333
give me the elevator pitch.

414
00:21:31,377 --> 00:21:33,857
Okay.
It's about original sin.

415
00:21:33,901 --> 00:21:35,294
It's about the sin
of stolen water

416
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:37,339
and the sin of incest

417
00:21:37,383 --> 00:21:40,516
and how politics and greed
connects them.

418
00:21:41,822 --> 00:21:43,563
But it's more than just a pitch.

419
00:21:43,606 --> 00:21:47,131
It's the actor, the director,
the big picture.

420
00:21:47,175 --> 00:21:50,961
That movie is really
coming together.

421
00:21:51,005 --> 00:21:52,746
No.

422
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:55,662
I'm not green-lighting anything
I don't understand, all right?

423
00:21:55,705 --> 00:21:58,882
We're gonna stop developing
these rarified flights of fancy

424
00:21:58,926 --> 00:22:00,884
and start applying
some good business sense

425
00:22:00,928 --> 00:22:02,408
to what we do here.

426
00:22:26,562 --> 00:22:27,650
Bob, open up.

427
00:22:31,698 --> 00:22:33,917
Come on, Bob, open up.
It's me. It's Al.

428
00:22:39,488 --> 00:22:41,708
Bob, open up, buddy.

429
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:50,107
Hey, it's Caesar.

430
00:22:50,151 --> 00:22:51,500
Okay.

431
00:22:55,286 --> 00:22:57,071
Caesar, I have Al coming to you

432
00:22:57,114 --> 00:23:00,379
in three, two...

433
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:02,119
Caesar.

434
00:23:02,163 --> 00:23:03,773
How they hanging?

435
00:23:03,817 --> 00:23:06,297
Low and ready for trouble.

436
00:23:06,341 --> 00:23:07,777
Hey, how's Joe doing?

437
00:23:07,821 --> 00:23:09,779
Same.

438
00:23:09,823 --> 00:23:11,694
How's the movie going?

439
00:23:11,738 --> 00:23:13,304
Good. We're getting close.

440
00:23:13,348 --> 00:23:14,741
That's great.

441
00:23:14,784 --> 00:23:15,848
You know, we're all really
looking forward

442
00:23:15,872 --> 00:23:17,004
to the premiere.

443
00:23:17,047 --> 00:23:18,701
You have a date yet?

444
00:23:18,745 --> 00:23:22,662
Boss wanted to invite
some of our... associates.

445
00:23:22,705 --> 00:23:25,055
Yeah, listen, about that...

446
00:23:25,099 --> 00:23:26,642
I know I said
I would donate the proceeds

447
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:27,971
to an Italian League charity,

448
00:23:28,015 --> 00:23:29,471
but Gulf and Western's
not gonna let me do that.

449
00:23:29,495 --> 00:23:31,018
Eh, forget about it.

450
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:33,324
Boss was never gonna
hold you to that.

451
00:23:33,368 --> 00:23:34,978
Okay, great.

452
00:23:35,022 --> 00:23:37,328
I just didn't want you guys
thinking that I forgot.

453
00:23:37,372 --> 00:23:39,069
We wouldn't have thought that.

454
00:23:41,245 --> 00:23:44,118
Is there anything we can do
to help Joe?

455
00:23:44,161 --> 00:23:46,860
You got a direct line to God?

456
00:23:46,903 --> 00:23:48,601
Look, I got to go.

457
00:23:48,644 --> 00:23:51,430
But, um, let me know
about that premiere, all right?

458
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:53,432
I want to get a new suit.

459
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:57,740
Hey.

460
00:23:57,784 --> 00:23:59,263
You know you can't invite
those guys

461
00:23:59,307 --> 00:24:00,395
to the premiere, right?

462
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,875
Charlie would murder you.

463
00:24:01,918 --> 00:24:04,660
I know, but I gave my word.

464
00:24:04,704 --> 00:24:07,924
So what are you gonna do?

465
00:24:07,968 --> 00:24:10,753
Oh.

466
00:24:13,234 --> 00:24:15,454
Al Ruddy's office.

467
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:18,587
Yes, sir, I'll tell him.

468
00:24:18,631 --> 00:24:20,850
Lapidus wants to see you.

469
00:24:20,894 --> 00:24:23,070
Great. Where?

470
00:24:23,113 --> 00:24:25,202
In Evans' office.

471
00:24:25,246 --> 00:24:26,552
Fuck.

472
00:24:34,385 --> 00:24:36,387
Try Evans again.
Let it ring until he picks up.

473
00:24:43,177 --> 00:24:45,135
Oh.

474
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:47,616
How was Italy?

475
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:50,184
Fine.

476
00:24:50,227 --> 00:24:53,187
Why did you stop
in New York on the way back?

477
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,449
Ooh...

478
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,495
I wanted a good bagel.
Ah.

479
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:58,584
Just isn't the same
out here in LA.

480
00:25:01,064 --> 00:25:03,632
I'm working on "The Godfather"
while Evans is out.

481
00:25:03,676 --> 00:25:08,071
Apparently he's got
a bad back, poor fella.

482
00:25:08,115 --> 00:25:11,248
Well, I think we can manage
until he's back on his feet.

483
00:25:11,292 --> 00:25:14,208
Oh, we don't know when
or even if that'll happen.

484
00:25:14,251 --> 00:25:15,557
It'll happen.

485
00:25:15,601 --> 00:25:18,125
When will I see a cut
of "The Godfather"?

486
00:25:18,168 --> 00:25:20,997
Francis is still shooting.

487
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:22,912
Yes, I know.

488
00:25:22,956 --> 00:25:25,654
He's in Sicily wasting money.

489
00:25:25,698 --> 00:25:27,003
It was always in the budget.

490
00:25:27,047 --> 00:25:29,702
I want to see that cut
as soon as possible.

491
00:25:31,442 --> 00:25:33,183
He'll be back end of the week,

492
00:25:33,227 --> 00:25:34,837
and our editor's standing by.

493
00:25:34,881 --> 00:25:37,361
Great.

494
00:25:37,405 --> 00:25:38,711
Great.

495
00:25:38,754 --> 00:25:42,062
I've got Bluhdorn on line one.

496
00:25:42,105 --> 00:25:44,151
Thank you, Sheila.

497
00:25:52,507 --> 00:25:53,507
Charlie.

498
00:26:17,663 --> 00:26:19,360
That one there.

499
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:46,430
How's it looking?

500
00:26:49,303 --> 00:26:51,087
You want to see for yourself?

501
00:27:16,591 --> 00:27:18,767
Well, I guess
no reaction is a reaction.

502
00:27:21,509 --> 00:27:22,989
We got it.

503
00:27:23,032 --> 00:27:24,164
What?

504
00:27:24,207 --> 00:27:25,644
Come here.Oh.

505
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:28,429
Oh, it's... it's beautiful.
It's beautiful.

506
00:27:28,472 --> 00:27:30,561
It's better than I ever
thought it could be.

507
00:27:30,605 --> 00:27:32,085
Buddy, it's so good.

508
00:27:32,128 --> 00:27:33,782
Jesus, fuck. Thank you.

509
00:27:33,826 --> 00:27:36,306
It is so powerful.
It...

510
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:38,308
Yeah. And Sicily.

511
00:27:38,352 --> 00:27:40,136
My God, it looks so beautiful.

512
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,592
It was worth us fighting
to go there.

513
00:27:41,616 --> 00:27:42,617
Yes, yes.

514
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:43,792
I know. Yep, absolutely.

515
00:27:43,836 --> 00:27:45,489
Absolutely.

516
00:27:45,533 --> 00:27:47,927
I want to show it to Evans.

517
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,232
Yeah, I think it's ready.

518
00:27:49,276 --> 00:27:50,756
I think it's ready.Okay.

519
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,298
Well, get him in here.
I want to show him right now.

520
00:27:52,322 --> 00:27:53,584
Put it on the screen right now.

521
00:27:53,628 --> 00:27:55,282
I'm gonna...
I got to talk to him.

522
00:27:55,325 --> 00:27:57,676
He's dealing with some
back issues right now, but...

523
00:27:57,719 --> 00:27:59,242
But he's... he's excited.Yeah.

524
00:27:59,286 --> 00:28:00,896
It's ready for him.

525
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,942
Okay.

526
00:28:02,985 --> 00:28:06,336
Um, I'm going to...

527
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,077
get some sleep, then.

528
00:28:08,121 --> 00:28:09,426
A shower couldn't hurt.

529
00:28:11,602 --> 00:28:14,040
You know what Evans told me?

530
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:16,520
He said the movie makes 50 mil,

531
00:28:16,564 --> 00:28:17,976
he's gonna buy me
whatever car I want.

532
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,436
It's good to be you.

533
00:28:23,789 --> 00:28:25,573
How are we gonna
show it to Evans

534
00:28:25,616 --> 00:28:28,054
when he isn't answering
your calls?

535
00:28:28,097 --> 00:28:30,447
I don't know.

536
00:28:30,491 --> 00:28:33,015
Also, Caesar called
about the premiere.

537
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:35,278
They're really expecting to go.

538
00:28:37,803 --> 00:28:39,108
Good news...

539
00:28:39,152 --> 00:28:40,893
Bogdanovich wants to direct

540
00:28:40,936 --> 00:28:42,522
after he's finished with post
on "What's up, Doc?"

541
00:28:42,546 --> 00:28:45,245
Great. He also...

542
00:28:45,288 --> 00:28:48,727
He wants to change the name
to "Paper Moon."

543
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:50,337
Well, I'm not sure
how that applies,

544
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,817
but it's a great title.

545
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,819
Now, I see you've done
your homework.

546
00:28:53,862 --> 00:28:55,646
Uh, what's your take
on adapting this?

547
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:57,213
Well...

548
00:28:57,257 --> 00:28:58,519
Peter.

549
00:28:58,562 --> 00:29:01,827
Hey.
Uh, I'm in a creative meeting.

550
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:04,003
Barry Lapidus. Alvin Sargent.

551
00:29:04,046 --> 00:29:06,570
Eh, Barry,
did you need something?

552
00:29:06,614 --> 00:29:08,921
No.
It can wait.

553
00:29:08,964 --> 00:29:11,358
I think I'll, uh, sit in.
Please, continue.

554
00:29:14,927 --> 00:29:17,756
Uh, so...

555
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:22,021
Well, I love the relationship
between Moses and Addie.

556
00:29:22,064 --> 00:29:24,153
Uh, I've never seen anything
like that.

557
00:29:24,197 --> 00:29:27,635
Sometime partner in crime,
sometimes father/daughter.

558
00:29:27,678 --> 00:29:29,700
But she'd never admit
that she wants a father figure.

559
00:29:29,724 --> 00:29:31,857
Well, girls need their fathers.

560
00:29:33,902 --> 00:29:36,470
It's important that we never
play him talking down to her

561
00:29:36,513 --> 00:29:39,212
as if she's
a regular nine-year-old.

562
00:29:39,255 --> 00:29:40,866
She was older
in the book, right?

563
00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:43,129
Yeah, I'd age her down
a few years.

564
00:29:43,172 --> 00:29:45,653
Make it even more shocking
that this little kid

565
00:29:45,696 --> 00:29:46,891
is so good at being
a con artist.

566
00:29:46,915 --> 00:29:48,438
Well, my daughter is 12,

567
00:29:48,482 --> 00:29:50,701
and I think she'd relate
to a 12-year-old

568
00:29:50,745 --> 00:29:52,965
more than a 9-year-old.

569
00:29:53,008 --> 00:29:54,836
Let's make her 12.

570
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,882
You need to keep
the audience in mind.

571
00:29:56,925 --> 00:30:01,538
Do they really want to see
a young kid as a con artist?

572
00:30:01,582 --> 00:30:05,412
That's what's so unique
about the book.

573
00:30:05,455 --> 00:30:06,805
Have you read it?

574
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:09,068
Skimmed.

575
00:30:09,111 --> 00:30:11,679
It's not
about her being a criminal.

576
00:30:11,722 --> 00:30:13,333
It's about her secret longing

577
00:30:13,376 --> 00:30:15,857
for the family
that she's never had.

578
00:30:15,901 --> 00:30:18,555
And she is the key to redemption

579
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:19,818
for the Moses character.

580
00:30:19,861 --> 00:30:21,863
Yeah.
He's... he's more the child

581
00:30:21,907 --> 00:30:24,257
because he caves in
to her every whim,

582
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,041
her every desire.

583
00:30:26,085 --> 00:30:27,869
He can't see past
his own ambition.

584
00:30:32,961 --> 00:30:34,789
Well...

585
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,791
I'm sorry to have to leave,
but I've got a thing.

586
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,140
It was nice to meet you.

587
00:30:38,184 --> 00:30:40,490
Peter, I'll catch up
with you later.

588
00:30:46,235 --> 00:30:47,846
Jesus!

589
00:30:51,066 --> 00:30:53,025
Oh, man.

590
00:30:53,068 --> 00:30:57,246
Why can't I do
just one lousy thing right?

591
00:30:59,292 --> 00:31:02,904
Ow! I hurt my arm.

592
00:31:02,948 --> 00:31:05,428
You're hopeless.
You're a hopeless mental case.

593
00:31:06,952 --> 00:31:09,693
I can't throw
with that arm... I got bursitis.

594
00:31:09,737 --> 00:31:11,739
I hope you don't mind
I let myself in.

595
00:31:11,782 --> 00:31:13,306
Leave your meals
outside the doors.

596
00:31:13,349 --> 00:31:15,221
The window was open.
Slide in the newspapers.

597
00:31:15,264 --> 00:31:16,787
Oh, shut it, Oscar.
I hurt easily.

598
00:31:16,831 --> 00:31:18,548
And that's the way I am,
and I can't help it.

599
00:31:18,572 --> 00:31:19,941
Well, you're not gonna cry,
are you?

600
00:31:19,965 --> 00:31:22,010
I think all those tears
dripping on your arm

601
00:31:22,054 --> 00:31:25,318
is what gave you bursitis.

602
00:31:25,361 --> 00:31:27,668
What's going on here, Bob?

603
00:31:27,711 --> 00:31:28,930
Watching a movie.

604
00:31:28,974 --> 00:31:31,933
No. I mean,
what's going on with you?

605
00:31:31,977 --> 00:31:33,195
I've called you 50 times.

606
00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:34,893
Nobody's seen you
in God knows how long.

607
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:39,332
He's a fucking genius.

608
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:40,942
How?

609
00:31:43,597 --> 00:31:45,599
People are worried about you.

610
00:31:45,642 --> 00:31:48,297
Who cares, Al?

611
00:31:48,341 --> 00:31:50,517
You? Yeah, me.

612
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,085
Francis, Charlie. Bluhdorn?

613
00:31:53,128 --> 00:31:57,089
He's probably got Barry
redecorating my office by now.

614
00:31:57,132 --> 00:31:59,047
None of it matters. Yes, it does.

615
00:31:59,091 --> 00:32:00,744
It doesn't.Yes, it does.

616
00:32:00,788 --> 00:32:03,312
But you can't just disappear
on us now, Bob.

617
00:32:03,356 --> 00:32:04,444
We need you.

618
00:32:04,487 --> 00:32:07,012
I'm a bad guru.

619
00:32:07,055 --> 00:32:08,796
I'm a false idol.

620
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:12,408
What happened with Ali?

621
00:32:14,497 --> 00:32:17,152
She's gone...

622
00:32:17,196 --> 00:32:18,762
and I can't get her back.

623
00:32:18,806 --> 00:32:20,547
Yes, you can.

624
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:22,351
It's never too late, but you
got to get your shit together.

625
00:32:22,375 --> 00:32:24,333
Interesting.

626
00:32:24,377 --> 00:32:25,682
Yeah, I never thought of that.

627
00:32:25,726 --> 00:32:28,555
Get my shit together.
Huh, piece of cake.

628
00:32:28,598 --> 00:32:32,994
Well, that won't take back
my wife fucking Steve McQueen.

629
00:32:38,608 --> 00:32:39,783
I'm sorry to hear that.

630
00:32:39,827 --> 00:32:41,611
Oh, go away, Al.

631
00:32:41,655 --> 00:32:43,744
Just let me fucking rot
in peace would you?

632
00:32:43,787 --> 00:32:45,920
Please, please.

633
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,096
Look...

634
00:32:50,316 --> 00:32:54,189
I'm no expert
on any of this either.

635
00:32:54,233 --> 00:32:57,584
I fucked up my relationship
with Francoise...

636
00:32:57,627 --> 00:32:59,107
and I really loved her.

637
00:32:59,151 --> 00:33:01,240
It hurt like hell
when she left me.

638
00:33:04,069 --> 00:33:05,418
And all she really wanted

639
00:33:05,461 --> 00:33:07,463
was a piece of me
that I couldn't give her

640
00:33:07,507 --> 00:33:09,944
because I was giving it all
to this movie.

641
00:33:12,468 --> 00:33:14,993
Bob, I'm here
because I care about you,

642
00:33:15,036 --> 00:33:16,516
but also because "The Godfather"

643
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,300
needs its godfather.

644
00:33:18,344 --> 00:33:19,780
You can't ignore
who you really are.

645
00:33:19,823 --> 00:33:21,521
Oh, God.
I mean, who am I?

646
00:33:21,564 --> 00:33:23,044
You're a fucking maverick.

647
00:33:23,088 --> 00:33:24,263
You're the guy that told me,

648
00:33:24,306 --> 00:33:25,786
"Do whatever it takes
to get it done."

649
00:33:25,829 --> 00:33:28,310
I'm no maverick.
What the fuck?

650
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,880
I'm an illusion...

651
00:33:32,923 --> 00:33:35,361
a character.

652
00:33:35,404 --> 00:33:39,147
Looks great on screen,
but it's just pretend.

653
00:33:39,191 --> 00:33:40,409
That's not true.

654
00:33:40,453 --> 00:33:41,604
What... what are you
talking about?

655
00:33:41,628 --> 00:33:44,065
We... we're all pretending.
Look at you.

656
00:33:44,109 --> 00:33:46,067
Pencil pusher...

657
00:33:46,111 --> 00:33:48,417
who thinks he's a producer.

658
00:33:48,461 --> 00:33:51,551
Look at me. Fuck.

659
00:33:51,594 --> 00:33:55,033
Shitty actor
becomes the king of Hollywood.

660
00:33:55,076 --> 00:33:57,470
I mean, if that...
If that's not pretending,

661
00:33:57,513 --> 00:34:00,168
I... I don't what the fuck is.

662
00:34:02,605 --> 00:34:05,304
Yeah.

663
00:34:11,484 --> 00:34:14,661
I just wanted it so bad...

664
00:34:14,704 --> 00:34:19,318
prove to the world
there's only one Bob Evans.

665
00:34:19,361 --> 00:34:21,407
I could do it on my own terms.

666
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:28,109
Power, prestige...

667
00:34:28,153 --> 00:34:30,372
perfect girl on my arm.

668
00:34:33,114 --> 00:34:36,248
I fell in love with it all.

669
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:38,119
Particularly the girl, you know?

670
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,429
I can't... I can't...

671
00:34:43,472 --> 00:34:46,258
I can't fucking do it
without her, all right?

672
00:34:48,782 --> 00:34:51,393
Nope. No.

673
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:56,268
Bob, think about
all the films that you've done.

674
00:34:56,311 --> 00:34:58,226
That's who you are,
with or without her.

675
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:00,881
None of it's fucking real!
None of it!

676
00:35:00,924 --> 00:35:02,883
Oh, yes, it is, or at least
it fucking better be,

677
00:35:02,926 --> 00:35:04,667
because we've sacrificed
too much

678
00:35:04,711 --> 00:35:06,495
for it not to mean anything.

679
00:35:06,539 --> 00:35:08,280
And as much as I'd like to think

680
00:35:08,323 --> 00:35:10,432
that if either one of us had
the opportunity to go back

681
00:35:10,456 --> 00:35:12,153
that we do anything
fucking different,

682
00:35:12,197 --> 00:35:14,155
I know that we wouldn't.

683
00:35:17,027 --> 00:35:18,986
With guys like us...

684
00:35:20,857 --> 00:35:22,618
There comes a point
where there is no separation

685
00:35:22,642 --> 00:35:25,688
between who we are
and what we do.

686
00:35:25,732 --> 00:35:28,822
And this...

687
00:35:28,865 --> 00:35:30,650
this is who we are.

688
00:35:34,219 --> 00:35:37,918
Al...

689
00:35:37,961 --> 00:35:40,573
I-I don't know.

690
00:35:40,616 --> 00:35:42,705
I-I don't know
if it's worth it anymore, man.

691
00:35:42,749 --> 00:35:45,317
I really don't, you know?

692
00:35:49,408 --> 00:35:50,670
It has to be.

693
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:04,292
Beginning to listen.

694
00:36:04,336 --> 00:36:06,164
You're not gonna hear
another peep out of me.

695
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:07,793
You're not gonna
give me a haircut, are you?

696
00:36:07,817 --> 00:36:09,515
I'm gonna cut up
some cabbage and greens

697
00:36:09,558 --> 00:36:11,212
and make coleslaw for tomorrow.

698
00:36:11,256 --> 00:36:12,866
I don't want
any coleslaw for tomorrow.

699
00:36:12,909 --> 00:36:14,191
I just want to have
some fun tonight.

700
00:36:14,215 --> 00:36:15,695
Thought you liked my coleslaw.

701
00:36:15,738 --> 00:36:17,262
I love your coleslaw. FELIX: Uh-huh.

702
00:36:17,305 --> 00:36:18,915
I swear, Felix,
I love your coleslaw.

703
00:36:18,959 --> 00:36:21,179
I'll take your coleslaw
with me to work tomorrow

704
00:36:21,222 --> 00:36:22,939
but not tonight...
Let's go out of the house.

705
00:36:22,963 --> 00:36:24,704
All right, let's go.

706
00:36:24,747 --> 00:36:26,290
I only make it for you.
I don't like coleslaw.

707
00:36:26,314 --> 00:36:27,683
If you wanted to get out
of the house,

708
00:36:27,707 --> 00:36:29,307
why didn't you say so
in the first place?

709
00:36:32,842 --> 00:36:35,236
"Murder. Mayhem. Mafia."

710
00:36:36,672 --> 00:36:38,892
That's sharp.
That's really sharp.

711
00:36:38,935 --> 00:36:40,375
"Murder. Mayhem. Mafia."
I like that.

712
00:36:40,415 --> 00:36:42,374
No, no.
We can't have the word "mafia"

713
00:36:42,417 --> 00:36:44,637
on the poster.

714
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,160
What else are you guys thinking?

715
00:36:57,563 --> 00:37:00,392
Hmm.
I'm not sure about the cat.

716
00:37:00,435 --> 00:37:02,394
Really?
The cat's the problem?

717
00:37:02,437 --> 00:37:03,786
I just don't get it.

718
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:05,788
What is this saying
about our film?

719
00:37:05,832 --> 00:37:08,922
He's powerful, dangerous,
and has a soft side.

720
00:37:08,965 --> 00:37:11,316
Oh, I see.

721
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,796
The cat represents
the soft side,

722
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,668
and the tagline,
"Take the Cannoli,"

723
00:37:15,711 --> 00:37:17,341
that's because he has
a sweet tooth, right?

724
00:37:17,365 --> 00:37:19,149
These are just preliminary.

725
00:37:19,193 --> 00:37:20,736
That's... that's the point
of this meeting.

726
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,868
So that the marketing team can
hear from the creatives, too.

727
00:37:22,892 --> 00:37:25,286
Well, I think the approach
is just a little off, okay?

728
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:26,853
Our film is about power.

729
00:37:26,896 --> 00:37:30,160
Who holds the strings
and manipulates everything?

730
00:37:30,204 --> 00:37:31,945
That is why I think
we should use

731
00:37:31,988 --> 00:37:33,599
the cover of the book
as the poster.

732
00:37:33,642 --> 00:37:35,383
Agreed.

733
00:37:35,427 --> 00:37:37,777
No, one's gonna know
what that is, right?

734
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:41,346
People are gonna think it's
a Nazi movie or something.

735
00:37:41,389 --> 00:37:43,957
Nazi? What the fuck?

736
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,264
That's not
a fucking swastika, Barry.

737
00:37:46,307 --> 00:37:47,830
Those are marionette strings.

738
00:37:47,874 --> 00:37:50,180
I know that, Ruddy.

739
00:37:50,224 --> 00:37:52,420
Look, these guys have worked on
hundreds of movies, all right?

740
00:37:52,444 --> 00:37:54,010
They know what they're doing.

741
00:37:54,054 --> 00:37:55,403
So you make the movie,

742
00:37:55,447 --> 00:37:58,493
and let the adults
figure out the poster, okay?

743
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:03,106
Top-notch work, guys.
Thank you.

744
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,978
Where the hell is Evans?

745
00:38:05,021 --> 00:38:08,721
Barry, why don't
we hear the guys out?

746
00:38:08,764 --> 00:38:11,164
You know, the cover is from the
bestselling book of the year.

747
00:38:12,986 --> 00:38:14,180
You want me
to hear these guys out?

748
00:38:14,204 --> 00:38:15,380
Why?

749
00:38:15,423 --> 00:38:17,251
Because they're so good
at delivering?

750
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,600
That's an interesting thought,

751
00:38:18,644 --> 00:38:20,012
because the only thing
that they've delivered

752
00:38:20,036 --> 00:38:22,125
is a movie
that's 45 minutes too long.

753
00:38:22,169 --> 00:38:23,625
Yeah, well, Evans
hasn't given his notes yet.

754
00:38:23,649 --> 00:38:24,954
So what?

755
00:38:24,998 --> 00:38:26,192
You shouldn't have seen it yet.

756
00:38:26,216 --> 00:38:29,176
Well, I have seen it,
and I can't unsee it.

757
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:31,004
So welcome
to Hollywood, Francis.

758
00:38:31,047 --> 00:38:34,181
I didn't realize
you were new to this.

759
00:38:36,009 --> 00:38:39,099
This movie cannot be longer
than two hours.

760
00:38:39,142 --> 00:38:41,580
Did you even like it?

761
00:38:41,623 --> 00:38:43,408
It was a little slow
for my taste.

762
00:38:43,451 --> 00:38:44,689
I mean, that whole Sicily thing?

763
00:38:44,713 --> 00:38:46,367
Why? It's Michael's tipping point.

764
00:38:46,411 --> 00:38:49,239
He understands that his life
can no longer be uncomplicated.

765
00:38:49,283 --> 00:38:50,719
Well, it's a waste.
Cut it.

766
00:38:50,763 --> 00:38:53,505
No, it's important
for the storytelling.

767
00:38:53,548 --> 00:38:55,526
You want to know what's
important for the storytelling?

768
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,900
Maximum plays per screen.

769
00:38:57,944 --> 00:39:01,251
A normal two-hour movie can run
five showings in a day,

770
00:39:01,295 --> 00:39:04,777
but your masterpiece
can only run three or four

771
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,605
because it's too long.

772
00:39:06,648 --> 00:39:09,912
Now, that is 20% less
box office.

773
00:39:09,956 --> 00:39:11,349
And money, gentlemen,

774
00:39:11,392 --> 00:39:13,263
whether you care
to admit it or not,

775
00:39:13,307 --> 00:39:14,830
it's important,

776
00:39:14,874 --> 00:39:16,789
'cause otherwise,
movies don't get made.

777
00:39:16,832 --> 00:39:19,705
Well, it doesn't matter
if the movie's not any good

778
00:39:19,748 --> 00:39:21,509
because nobody's gonna be
in the fucking theater

779
00:39:21,533 --> 00:39:23,709
for the maximum plays per day.

780
00:39:23,752 --> 00:39:24,947
All right... RUDDY: Who gives a shit?

781
00:39:24,971 --> 00:39:26,886
Is there a compromise
to be had here?

782
00:39:26,929 --> 00:39:29,410
Yes, there is.
Cut 30 minutes.

783
00:39:29,454 --> 00:39:30,933
It's not an option.

784
00:39:34,937 --> 00:39:37,810
Better get cracking, gentlemen,
or I'll cut it myself.

785
00:39:42,815 --> 00:39:44,120
Ruddy...

786
00:39:57,525 --> 00:39:59,353
What do you think?

787
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,616
That work?

788
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:04,010
I don't know.

789
00:40:10,843 --> 00:40:15,021
You want me to run it again?

790
00:40:15,064 --> 00:40:17,850
Do whatever you want.
They're ruining my picture.

791
00:40:25,031 --> 00:40:27,207
Come in.

792
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:31,516
Hi.

793
00:40:37,043 --> 00:40:41,047
You were, uh, a little rough
on them in that meeting.

794
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:42,483
They're big boys, Peter.

795
00:40:42,527 --> 00:40:45,268
I don't have to pander
to spoiled children.

796
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,661
Actually, you do, Barry.

797
00:40:50,056 --> 00:40:54,800
Look, if you're stepping
into Evans' shoes...

798
00:40:54,843 --> 00:40:58,281
you need to understand
what he actually does...

799
00:40:58,325 --> 00:41:00,196
and what he's really good at.

800
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,764
I've got my own shoes.
I don't need Bob's.

801
00:41:02,808 --> 00:41:04,723
The creatives
aren't just monkeys

802
00:41:04,766 --> 00:41:06,420
with pens and typewriters.

803
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,814
They... they have a real vision
for the film.

804
00:41:08,857 --> 00:41:09,878
I mean, they know it better
than anybody.

805
00:41:09,902 --> 00:41:11,817
Yeah, and I know what sells.

806
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:14,515
Yes, you do, and that is great,

807
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:16,474
but it's more than that.

808
00:41:16,517 --> 00:41:18,998
It's... it's using the creatives

809
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:21,217
to guide the marketing
so we can come up

810
00:41:21,261 --> 00:41:23,568
with something unique
and eye-catching.

811
00:41:23,611 --> 00:41:26,353
It's nurturing their talent
to write the best script,

812
00:41:26,396 --> 00:41:28,486
to direct the best film.

813
00:41:28,529 --> 00:41:30,159
And it's talking over character
and themes...

814
00:41:30,183 --> 00:41:33,012
Bob isn't here, Peter, okay?

815
00:41:35,275 --> 00:41:39,409
So his shoes, no matter
how big and creative they are,

816
00:41:39,453 --> 00:41:43,588
they will remain empty,
in a closet, forgotten.

817
00:41:43,631 --> 00:41:44,937
Okay?

818
00:41:50,072 --> 00:41:51,726
Okay.

819
00:41:55,556 --> 00:41:57,384
Okay.

820
00:42:05,697 --> 00:42:09,265
You're a valuable asset, Peter.

821
00:42:09,309 --> 00:42:10,832
You are.

822
00:42:12,486 --> 00:42:14,575
So I, uh...

823
00:42:14,619 --> 00:42:17,273
I hope that
you'll remain on board.

824
00:42:20,189 --> 00:42:22,496
I wasn't criticizing you, Barry.

825
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,237
I was trying to help you.

826
00:43:34,133 --> 00:43:35,656
Good night, Sheila.

827
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:38,354
Good night, Mr. Evans...

828
00:43:38,398 --> 00:43:39,573
Mr. Lapidus.

829
00:43:42,794 --> 00:43:44,143
Good night.

830
00:44:02,117 --> 00:44:03,945
Charlie.
I wasn't expecting you.

831
00:44:03,989 --> 00:44:06,992
I just got in.
You're my first stop.

832
00:44:13,172 --> 00:44:14,564
You're a pain in the ass, Ruddy,

833
00:44:14,608 --> 00:44:17,872
but you've done a good job
on this movie.

834
00:44:17,916 --> 00:44:19,744
Thank you.Yeah.

835
00:44:25,793 --> 00:44:27,969
Evans is done.

836
00:44:28,013 --> 00:44:29,623
I wanted you to hear it from me.

837
00:44:31,277 --> 00:44:34,193
This isn't easy for me,
whatever you think.

838
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:37,762
But it has to be done.

839
00:44:37,805 --> 00:44:41,069
And I'm putting Lapidus
in charge.

840
00:44:41,113 --> 00:44:44,290
Charlie, we need Bob.

841
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:45,857
You know that we do.

842
00:44:49,077 --> 00:44:51,471
This whiskey tastes like shit.

843
00:44:51,514 --> 00:44:53,429
Get something that burns.

844
00:45:08,183 --> 00:45:10,142
We're going to go with this one,

845
00:45:10,185 --> 00:45:12,057
but let's use
the other tagline...

846
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:15,103
"Take the Cannoli." That's great.

847
00:45:15,147 --> 00:45:16,931
Charlie, what do you think?

848
00:45:16,975 --> 00:45:19,325
Just observing.

849
00:45:19,368 --> 00:45:21,762
And, Francis, thank you for
trimming the fat off the movie.

850
00:45:21,806 --> 00:45:24,417
It's much better now. Yeah,
stayed awake this time.

851
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:26,462
Shorter is not always better.

852
00:45:26,506 --> 00:45:29,378
Charlie, you really should
consider the longer cut.

853
00:45:29,422 --> 00:45:31,641
It is better. BARRY: For who? Hmm?

854
00:45:31,685 --> 00:45:33,252
Your ego?

855
00:45:33,295 --> 00:45:34,882
I thought I explained
the business to you, Ruddy.

856
00:45:34,906 --> 00:45:37,212
The audience doesn't care

857
00:45:37,256 --> 00:45:40,085
about our business, Barry.

858
00:45:40,128 --> 00:45:41,477
Bob.

859
00:45:44,132 --> 00:45:45,743
How's the back?

860
00:45:45,786 --> 00:45:47,266
Getting there.
Thanks for asking.

861
00:45:48,528 --> 00:45:49,834
Flying V?

862
00:45:53,185 --> 00:45:54,795
We can't use this.

863
00:45:54,839 --> 00:45:57,885
You can't just show up here
whenever you want

864
00:45:57,929 --> 00:45:59,776
and just blow apart
everything we're working on.

865
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,628
I'm not blowing
anything up, Barry.

866
00:46:01,671 --> 00:46:03,891
It simply does not represent
the film.

867
00:46:03,935 --> 00:46:06,981
It doesn't create mystery
or intrigue.

868
00:46:07,025 --> 00:46:09,114
That's your opinion, Bob.
You're damn right it is.

869
00:46:09,157 --> 00:46:10,744
But it's also based on
market research as well.

870
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,770
Our testing has shown

871
00:46:12,813 --> 00:46:15,555
that audiences are turned off
by busy key art.

872
00:46:15,598 --> 00:46:18,819
They particularly don't like
the V.

873
00:46:18,863 --> 00:46:20,647
It doesn't allow them
to connect to anything.

874
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:22,475
Look, "The Godfather" sold
more copies

875
00:46:22,518 --> 00:46:24,496
than any other book in history
except for the Bible.

876
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,087
Now, we're trying to take
the audience

877
00:46:26,131 --> 00:46:28,002
for a peek inside
the secretive subculture

878
00:46:28,046 --> 00:46:29,308
they're not normally privy to.

879
00:46:29,351 --> 00:46:32,137
We should be using the key art

880
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:35,314
from the book.

881
00:46:35,357 --> 00:46:36,881
It creates mystery.

882
00:46:38,665 --> 00:46:40,449
What about the cut? I'm glad you asked.

883
00:46:40,493 --> 00:46:41,624
'Cause as far as I remember,

884
00:46:41,668 --> 00:46:43,322
we hired Francis
to make us a movie.

885
00:46:43,365 --> 00:46:46,194
And the shorter version
of this film, it's a trailer.

886
00:46:46,238 --> 00:46:48,501
It's a teaser.
It's a... it's an insult.

887
00:46:48,544 --> 00:46:49,850
It is defeat

888
00:46:49,894 --> 00:46:51,809
waiting to be pulled
from the jaws of victory.

889
00:46:51,852 --> 00:46:55,421
And, Francis, frankly,
your cut is gorgeous.

890
00:46:55,464 --> 00:46:56,726
Sublime. Perfect.

891
00:46:56,770 --> 00:46:58,641
Bob, you know as well as I do

892
00:46:58,685 --> 00:47:00,121
that, one, it's going to reduce

893
00:47:00,165 --> 00:47:01,644
the number of screenings
per day.

894
00:47:01,688 --> 00:47:04,082
And, two, no one wants
to sit in a theater that long

895
00:47:04,125 --> 00:47:05,300
for a gangster movie.

896
00:47:05,344 --> 00:47:06,649
Yeah, I do know that,

897
00:47:06,693 --> 00:47:08,149
but this is not
a typical gangster movie.

898
00:47:08,173 --> 00:47:09,498
It never was,
and we're not offering

899
00:47:09,522 --> 00:47:11,567
the audience a transaction.

900
00:47:11,611 --> 00:47:14,309
We're offering them
an experience.

901
00:47:14,353 --> 00:47:17,312
Look, we need to evolve
with the population.

902
00:47:17,356 --> 00:47:20,838
We need to lead the revolution,
or it will pass us by, Charlie.

903
00:47:22,796 --> 00:47:24,754
Barry...

904
00:47:24,798 --> 00:47:26,756
you never wanted to make
"Rosemary's Baby"

905
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,149
or "Love Story."

906
00:47:28,193 --> 00:47:29,518
You didn't want to make
"The Godfather."

907
00:47:29,542 --> 00:47:31,805
These... these movies,
they break all the rules.

908
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:33,981
They're not formulaic.

909
00:47:34,025 --> 00:47:35,287
This is part of why they work.

910
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:36,723
But, look, we can't chase

911
00:47:36,766 --> 00:47:38,309
after what we think an audience
wants to see.

912
00:47:38,333 --> 00:47:40,253
We got to show the audience
what it needs to see.

913
00:47:43,382 --> 00:47:45,514
How did you get
the cuts, Bob, huh?

914
00:47:47,952 --> 00:47:49,127
Bubbe, please.

915
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,918
Let me think about it.

916
00:47:57,962 --> 00:47:59,137
Everybody out.

917
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:00,442
Barry, you stay.

918
00:48:10,496 --> 00:48:13,151
All right.
How do you think that went?

919
00:48:13,194 --> 00:48:15,196
Hard to tell.

920
00:48:17,111 --> 00:48:19,766
Bob, what does this mean?

921
00:48:19,809 --> 00:48:21,115
Can we go back
to the longer cut?

922
00:48:21,159 --> 00:48:23,378
Oh, God, I hope so.

923
00:48:23,422 --> 00:48:25,641
I really loved it, Francis.

924
00:48:25,685 --> 00:48:27,339
You did it, man.

925
00:48:27,382 --> 00:48:28,296
Thank you.

926
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:29,819
One thing...

927
00:48:29,863 --> 00:48:31,082
Horse's head scene,

928
00:48:31,125 --> 00:48:33,606
the music gets too ominous
too quickly.

929
00:48:33,649 --> 00:48:35,260
It gives away
what's about to happen.

930
00:48:35,303 --> 00:48:37,436
Why don't you
take a look at that?

931
00:48:39,568 --> 00:48:40,918
Is that it?

932
00:48:40,961 --> 00:48:41,962
For now.

933
00:48:42,006 --> 00:48:44,225
Okay.

934
00:48:44,269 --> 00:48:45,574
It's good
to have you back, boss.

935
00:48:45,618 --> 00:48:47,620
Yeah, we'll see.

936
00:48:47,663 --> 00:48:49,665
Go on. Get out of here.

937
00:48:49,709 --> 00:48:51,015
Go on.

938
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:59,284
You still want it?

939
00:48:59,327 --> 00:49:00,546
What?

940
00:49:04,985 --> 00:49:06,247
And Evans?

941
00:49:06,291 --> 00:49:08,249
That would be your decision.

942
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,651
He's a pain in the ass.

943
00:49:18,694 --> 00:49:21,915
He's egotistical, smug,
and entitled.

944
00:49:24,613 --> 00:49:26,441
We've never gotten along.

945
00:49:26,485 --> 00:49:28,835
We agree on nothing,
and if it were up to me,

946
00:49:28,878 --> 00:49:31,664
I would've been the first one
to get him a one-way ticket

947
00:49:31,707 --> 00:49:33,274
to anywhere but here.

948
00:49:35,929 --> 00:49:37,800
And I would've been wrong.

949
00:49:40,325 --> 00:49:43,502
He's still an asshole,
but there's no denying talent.

950
00:49:43,545 --> 00:49:46,026
And despite all
of his posturing and bullshit,

951
00:49:46,070 --> 00:49:47,941
he's got good instincts.

952
00:49:49,551 --> 00:49:51,727
A lot of what he touches
turns to gold.

953
00:49:53,642 --> 00:49:55,079
That's what's important.

954
00:49:57,646 --> 00:50:00,214
Are you saying you... Evans
should be at the helm.

955
00:50:05,654 --> 00:50:07,091
You surprise me, Barry.

956
00:50:10,094 --> 00:50:12,400
Yeah, well...

957
00:50:12,444 --> 00:50:14,228
Never hate your enemies.

958
00:50:14,272 --> 00:50:16,752
It's not personal.

959
00:50:16,796 --> 00:50:18,885
It's just business.

960
00:50:21,409 --> 00:50:22,758
Hmm.

961
00:50:38,209 --> 00:50:40,602
How do I know I can trust you?

962
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,912
I don't know, Charlie.

963
00:50:45,955 --> 00:50:48,045
I only have my word.

964
00:51:00,927 --> 00:51:03,582
I like movies about history.

965
00:51:03,625 --> 00:51:06,106
Did you know that?

966
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:08,978
I did not.
Mm.

967
00:51:09,022 --> 00:51:11,633
Yeah, sure, I like all the tits
and the action

968
00:51:11,677 --> 00:51:14,854
and all the rest, but history...

969
00:51:14,897 --> 00:51:18,466
we get to see something which
is impossible for us to see,

970
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:23,341
and the story is retold to be
whatever we want it to be.

971
00:51:23,384 --> 00:51:25,821
Some people think
that's a crime,

972
00:51:25,865 --> 00:51:28,433
but I don't.

973
00:51:28,476 --> 00:51:30,391
Rewriting history...

974
00:51:32,828 --> 00:51:35,440
Maybe that's how we can deal
with the horror.

975
00:51:39,183 --> 00:51:41,968
If you could rewrite
your history, would you?

976
00:51:45,145 --> 00:51:47,800
No.

977
00:51:47,843 --> 00:51:50,759
May not be pretty,
but it's mine.

978
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:56,025
Smart money says get rid of you.

979
00:51:58,332 --> 00:51:59,899
I understand.

980
00:52:01,944 --> 00:52:04,033
Barry convinced me otherwise.

981
00:52:06,775 --> 00:52:10,301
You're getting a chance
to rewrite your history, Bob.

982
00:52:13,217 --> 00:52:15,132
Don't make me regret it.

983
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,313
Now go make me
some fucking money.

984
00:52:43,508 --> 00:52:45,031
Guess what.

985
00:52:45,074 --> 00:52:46,511
We're going with the longer cut.

986
00:52:46,554 --> 00:52:48,948
Oh, thank God.

987
00:52:48,991 --> 00:52:50,384
That's great news.

988
00:52:50,428 --> 00:52:52,430
Oh, you think so?

989
00:52:52,473 --> 00:52:53,822
You said you liked
the longer cut.

990
00:52:53,866 --> 00:52:55,302
I meant it.
I meant it.

991
00:52:55,346 --> 00:52:56,651
But don't think for a second

992
00:52:56,695 --> 00:52:58,349
that if this thing
flops financially,

993
00:52:58,392 --> 00:53:00,192
you and I won't end up
being chained to a rock

994
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:02,527
with Bluhdorn picking
at our livers every day.

995
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:04,224
Lapidus wasn't wrong.

996
00:53:04,268 --> 00:53:05,854
There are huge risks to doing
it the way we're doing it.

997
00:53:05,878 --> 00:53:07,445
I know, I know.
Less screenings a day.

998
00:53:07,488 --> 00:53:09,186
That's a very big deal.

999
00:53:09,229 --> 00:53:11,100
And even more than that,
with a longer cut,

1000
00:53:11,144 --> 00:53:12,841
there's no way
we're ready for Christmas,

1001
00:53:12,885 --> 00:53:14,602
which is the best time
to release this movie

1002
00:53:14,626 --> 00:53:16,149
or even a month later.

1003
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,412
Audience attendances drop
like a fucking brick.

1004
00:53:18,456 --> 00:53:21,110
Oh, come on, we got lightning
in a bottle here.

1005
00:53:21,154 --> 00:53:22,895
Well, if that bottle's
in your pocket,

1006
00:53:22,938 --> 00:53:24,658
be careful you don't fry
your balls with it.

1007
00:53:25,767 --> 00:53:28,205
Look, if it was easy,

1008
00:53:28,248 --> 00:53:29,815
everybody would do it.

1009
00:53:29,858 --> 00:53:31,295
Amen.

1010
00:53:34,298 --> 00:53:37,039
Oh, and, Al...

1011
00:53:41,043 --> 00:53:42,828
Thank you.

1012
00:53:45,439 --> 00:53:47,180
Anytime, bubbe.

1013
00:53:50,314 --> 00:53:52,272
Yeah.

1014
00:53:57,886 --> 00:53:59,410
Oh, yes, I see.
Thank you.

1015
00:54:02,021 --> 00:54:04,153
Michael. Hey, Bob.

1016
00:54:04,197 --> 00:54:05,503
Hey, Jerry. Hey, Bob.

1017
00:54:05,546 --> 00:54:06,895
Eat your food.

1018
00:54:06,939 --> 00:54:07,959
Well, it's a very particular...

1019
00:54:07,983 --> 00:54:10,421
He's coming this way.
Um, Bob?

1020
00:54:25,610 --> 00:54:27,002
Barry.

1021
00:54:28,656 --> 00:54:30,876
Bob.

1022
00:54:30,919 --> 00:54:33,400
Mind if I join you?

1023
00:54:33,444 --> 00:54:35,620
Please.

1024
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:41,495
You know, they don't always put
salmon on the menu,

1025
00:54:41,539 --> 00:54:43,280
but they'll make it for us.

1026
00:54:45,369 --> 00:54:46,674
Mineral water, Barry?

1027
00:54:46,718 --> 00:54:48,807
Yeah.

1028
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:49,895
John.

1029
00:54:49,938 --> 00:54:53,115
Thank you for coming in.

1030
00:54:53,159 --> 00:54:54,247
Oh.Excuse me.

1031
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,291
Hey.

1032
00:54:57,555 --> 00:54:59,383
Is that the cigarette ad guy?

1033
00:55:01,515 --> 00:55:04,823
I got to be honest, that is
one handsome motherfucker.

1034
00:55:04,866 --> 00:55:06,781
So? I've never been so happy

1035
00:55:06,825 --> 00:55:09,262
to see that tan bastard
in my life.

1036
00:55:11,743 --> 00:55:14,485
Bettye, I need your help.

1037
00:55:14,528 --> 00:55:16,835
Could I get fired for it?

1038
00:55:16,878 --> 00:55:20,273
We both could,
but it's worth it.

1039
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,366
You're not on the list.

1040
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:28,194
Well, that just doesn't make
any sense, Gene.

1041
00:55:28,237 --> 00:55:30,022
Eugene.

1042
00:55:30,065 --> 00:55:33,068
Eugene.
Of course. Sorry.

1043
00:55:33,112 --> 00:55:35,157
It's just you remind me
a lot of Gene Kelly.

1044
00:55:35,201 --> 00:55:37,943
You must get that all the time.

1045
00:55:37,986 --> 00:55:39,771
You're not on the list.

1046
00:55:39,814 --> 00:55:41,381
Bob Evans sent me.

1047
00:55:41,425 --> 00:55:43,949
Call Sheila.
Check it out.

1048
00:55:43,992 --> 00:55:45,385
What's your name again?

1049
00:55:48,519 --> 00:55:50,042
Be careful.

1050
00:55:50,085 --> 00:55:51,957
There's only two prints. Of course.

1051
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,698
Thank you, Eugene.

1052
00:56:09,061 --> 00:56:11,672
Relax, they're fine.

1053
00:56:11,716 --> 00:56:15,110
That is $6.5 million
sitting in that seat.

1054
00:56:19,506 --> 00:56:21,639
How'd you end up
getting the plane?

1055
00:56:21,682 --> 00:56:23,292
Bob owed me one.

1056
00:56:23,336 --> 00:56:26,339
Mm.Yeah.

1057
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:30,865
So what was up with that
actor meeting the other day?

1058
00:56:30,909 --> 00:56:33,390
I was just looking at options
for your next picture.

1059
00:56:40,527 --> 00:56:42,703
All right, all right.

1060
00:56:46,315 --> 00:56:49,580
I was thinking
about what I want to do next,

1061
00:56:49,623 --> 00:56:51,799
and I'm thinking
of maybe becoming an agent.

1062
00:56:55,455 --> 00:56:57,892
What?
You don't think I can do it?

1063
00:56:57,936 --> 00:57:00,591
No, no.
I think you can do anything.

1064
00:57:02,027 --> 00:57:03,332
What is it, then?

1065
00:57:06,466 --> 00:57:09,295
I don't know.
I guess...

1066
00:57:09,338 --> 00:57:11,123
when I think about what's next,

1067
00:57:11,166 --> 00:57:13,386
I just assumed
you'd be there with me.

1068
00:57:14,866 --> 00:57:16,955
I love working for you, Al.

1069
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:21,002
But I do want more.

1070
00:57:21,046 --> 00:57:23,328
I mean, when the world looks
at me, all they see is someone

1071
00:57:23,352 --> 00:57:25,833
whose job it is
to support a man.

1072
00:57:29,402 --> 00:57:30,577
Why an agent?

1073
00:57:32,274 --> 00:57:34,363
I really like actors.

1074
00:57:34,407 --> 00:57:36,801
I mean, they're delusional...
They have to be

1075
00:57:36,844 --> 00:57:39,194
if they think they're gonna
make it in this business.

1076
00:57:39,238 --> 00:57:42,197
And justified or not,
they all dream big.

1077
00:57:42,241 --> 00:57:43,851
Also, I am loud.
Mm.

1078
00:57:43,895 --> 00:57:45,374
I am very smart.Mm.

1079
00:57:45,418 --> 00:57:48,421
I'm vicious.

1080
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:51,380
I mean,
maybe I'm delusional, too.

1081
00:57:51,424 --> 00:57:53,208
But I do know

1082
00:57:53,252 --> 00:57:56,516
that I don't want to get
trapped in this tiny little box

1083
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:59,214
that the men of this world
have given me.

1084
00:57:59,258 --> 00:58:01,347
I want my own seat at the table.

1085
00:58:15,274 --> 00:58:16,405
Hey, get up.

1086
00:58:16,449 --> 00:58:18,059
Hi.

1087
00:58:18,103 --> 00:58:19,931
Hey.

1088
00:58:19,974 --> 00:58:22,890
They didn't have Raisinettes.No.

1089
00:58:22,934 --> 00:58:24,457
What about Whoppers?

1090
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:25,589
She wants Whoppers, okay.

1091
00:58:25,632 --> 00:58:27,634
I'm joking.
Sit down.

1092
00:58:27,678 --> 00:58:28,896
Is this one mine? Yeah.

1093
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:30,898
Thank you.

1094
00:58:30,942 --> 00:58:32,683
I can't believe Paramount

1095
00:58:32,726 --> 00:58:34,902
is gonna do this
special screening just for us.

1096
00:58:41,082 --> 00:58:43,563
Hey, where did you
just come from?

1097
00:58:43,607 --> 00:58:45,347
The alley.

1098
00:58:45,391 --> 00:58:46,958
Why?

1099
00:58:47,001 --> 00:58:49,700
Because every gangster
within 50 miles is in here,

1100
00:58:49,743 --> 00:58:51,702
which means
the FBI is out there.

1101
00:58:51,745 --> 00:58:54,139
And I for once would like
to remain anonymous.

1102
00:58:54,182 --> 00:58:55,836
Hey, Ruddy!

1103
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:58,317
If this movie sucks, you ain't
making it out of the theater.

1104
00:59:01,276 --> 00:59:05,063
And he fucking means it, too!

1105
00:59:27,128 --> 00:59:28,826
Awoo!

1106
00:59:48,628 --> 00:59:50,630
Oh!

1107
00:59:50,674 --> 00:59:51,979
Ruddy!

1108
01:00:27,711 --> 01:00:29,713
Don Corleone...

1109
01:00:41,812 --> 01:00:44,075
I guess we live
to see another day!

1110
01:00:44,118 --> 01:00:46,599
What a relief.

1111
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:48,035
Look at this!

1112
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:50,255
Wow.

1113
01:00:50,298 --> 01:00:52,953
Oh, my God.

1114
01:00:52,997 --> 01:00:56,435
I think that might be
the best movie I've ever seen.

1115
01:00:56,478 --> 01:00:58,263
That means a lot.

1116
01:00:58,306 --> 01:01:00,415
Honestly, I think we care more
about what you guys think

1117
01:01:00,439 --> 01:01:02,441
than anybody else.

1118
01:01:02,484 --> 01:01:05,052
The boss would've loved it.

1119
01:01:08,752 --> 01:01:10,188
Do me a favor.

1120
01:01:10,231 --> 01:01:12,031
Grab the print, catch a cab
back to the hotel.

1121
01:01:12,059 --> 01:01:14,192
I got to go do something. Of course.

1122
01:01:18,805 --> 01:01:19,980
Hey.

1123
01:01:22,853 --> 01:01:25,551
Listen, I'd really like
to take you out

1124
01:01:25,594 --> 01:01:28,510
the next time
you're back in New York.

1125
01:01:28,554 --> 01:01:30,425
I don't know, Caesar.

1126
01:01:32,471 --> 01:01:34,995
You're a pretty dangerous guy.

1127
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:37,650
Um, some girls like dangerous.

1128
01:02:08,159 --> 01:02:09,464
They, uh...

1129
01:02:11,597 --> 01:02:14,078
They all stood up
and applauded, Joe.

1130
01:02:15,862 --> 01:02:17,734
You would've loved it.

1131
01:02:25,437 --> 01:02:27,221
Tell you what, buddy.

1132
01:02:29,397 --> 01:02:30,572
When you're feeling better,

1133
01:02:30,616 --> 01:02:33,445
I'm gonna set up
a special screening

1134
01:02:33,488 --> 01:02:35,316
just for you.

1135
01:04:21,553 --> 01:04:23,033
We've got a great movie.

1136
01:04:23,076 --> 01:04:25,818
It doesn't matter
if nobody sees it.

1137
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,274
We gotta do
something different here.

1138
01:04:27,298 --> 01:04:28,298
Like what?

1139
01:04:29,126 --> 01:04:31,476
We need to get something going,
and fast.

1140
01:04:31,911 --> 01:04:34,131
It's crazy. Crazy's good, I like crazy.

1141
01:04:34,174 --> 01:04:35,349
That's unheard of.

1142
01:04:35,393 --> 01:04:36,698
It's never been done before.

1143
01:04:36,742 --> 01:04:38,744
Why play it safe
when we can crash and burn.

1144
01:04:38,787 --> 01:04:41,181
The idea of losing money
gives me a rash.

1145
01:04:41,225 --> 01:04:42,269
But if it works...

1146
01:04:42,313 --> 01:04:43,793
Do you think I'm crazy
for doing this?

1147
01:04:44,271 --> 01:04:45,838
We make film history.

1148
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:51,061
I have this recurring dream
aboutThe Godfather premiere.

1149
01:04:51,104 --> 01:04:52,104
Wow.

1150
01:04:53,672 --> 01:04:54,997
It's the pot of gold
at the end of the rainbow.

1151
01:04:55,021 --> 01:04:58,677
And it's a perfect night.
To The Godfather.

1152
01:05:08,078 --> 01:05:09,078
Action.

1153
01:05:15,346 --> 01:05:17,652
Barry, when did you get in?

1154
01:05:17,957 --> 01:05:18,957
Come in.

1155
01:05:20,786 --> 01:05:21,786
Right.

1156
01:05:22,396 --> 01:05:23,396
Close the door.

1157
01:05:24,137 --> 01:05:25,137
Sure.

1158
01:05:27,488 --> 01:05:29,099
I play Barry Lapidus.

1159
01:05:29,142 --> 01:05:31,144
Lapidus is kind of the bad guy.

1160
01:05:31,405 --> 01:05:34,452
He's an antagonist for
a lot of the series.

1161
01:05:34,495 --> 01:05:37,237
He is basically a composite
of every single person

1162
01:05:37,281 --> 01:05:39,544
that did not want to make
The Godfather.

1163
01:05:44,505 --> 01:05:48,161
No, I'm not green-lighting
anything I don't understand.

1164
01:05:48,205 --> 01:05:49,946
All right, we're going
to stop developing

1165
01:05:49,989 --> 01:05:51,730
these rarefied flights of fancy,

1166
01:05:51,773 --> 01:05:54,037
and start applying some
good business sense

1167
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:55,212
to what we do here.

1168
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:58,756
Normally, you know, when you
have those kinds of roles,

1169
01:05:58,780 --> 01:06:00,782
it can kind of be
one dimensional.

1170
01:06:01,044 --> 01:06:04,699
But every reason
that Lapidus has

1171
01:06:04,743 --> 01:06:07,572
as to why this is a bad idea,

1172
01:06:07,615 --> 01:06:09,966
from his perspective,
makes perfect sense.

1173
01:06:10,314 --> 01:06:13,839
And money, gentlemen, whether
you care to admit it or not,

1174
01:06:13,882 --> 01:06:14,883
it's important,

1175
01:06:16,059 --> 01:06:17,427
'cause otherwise
movies don't get made.

1176
01:06:17,451 --> 01:06:19,540
If there weren't for the
business side of people

1177
01:06:19,584 --> 01:06:21,020
who did fight for the creatives,

1178
01:06:21,064 --> 01:06:23,327
then it would just
be the business side

1179
01:06:23,370 --> 01:06:24,695
and who knows what
we may have lost

1180
01:06:24,719 --> 01:06:26,112
or what we may have never seen.

1181
01:06:26,504 --> 01:06:28,462
If you're
stepping into Evans' shoes,

1182
01:06:29,811 --> 01:06:32,249
you need to understand
what he actually does.

1183
01:06:33,076 --> 01:06:34,686
Lapidus was the last character

1184
01:06:34,729 --> 01:06:37,689
I thought I was going
to have empathy for,

1185
01:06:37,732 --> 01:06:40,170
but there's a scene in nine
that Colin does beautifully,

1186
01:06:40,431 --> 01:06:42,781
where he's trying
to kind of take over

1187
01:06:42,824 --> 01:06:44,348
and fill Evans' shoes,

1188
01:06:44,739 --> 01:06:47,873
and there's a moment
where he's sitting

1189
01:06:47,916 --> 01:06:48,916
behind Evans' desk,

1190
01:06:50,354 --> 01:06:51,635
and you're enough in
his head at that point

1191
01:06:51,659 --> 01:06:53,705
that you realize
he's grappling with the thought

1192
01:06:53,748 --> 01:06:55,315
that he does not
have what it takes

1193
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:58,014
to be what Bob Evans was.

1194
01:06:58,362 --> 01:07:00,059
He realizes that he
doesn't necessarily

1195
01:07:00,103 --> 01:07:01,365
have the skill set for that.

1196
01:07:01,887 --> 01:07:02,887
And to his credit,

1197
01:07:03,932 --> 01:07:05,456
he was smart enough
to recognize that,

1198
01:07:05,499 --> 01:07:08,198
and ends up being a champion
of Evans in the end.

1199
01:07:08,241 --> 01:07:09,721
We agree on nothing,

1200
01:07:09,764 --> 01:07:10,896
and if it were up to me,

1201
01:07:10,939 --> 01:07:12,767
I would've been the
first one to get him

1202
01:07:12,811 --> 01:07:15,074
a one way ticket
to anywhere but here.

1203
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:18,425
And I would've been wrong.

1204
01:07:18,469 --> 01:07:20,166
I love that when characters

1205
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:22,690
that you have pegged
as being one thing

1206
01:07:22,734 --> 01:07:26,738
suddenly end up having to play
a different and vital role.

1207
01:07:26,781 --> 01:07:27,981
I thought it was a nice touch,

1208
01:07:29,523 --> 01:07:31,675
and it was a nice way to sort
of bring him into the fold,

1209
01:07:31,699 --> 01:07:35,051
as sort of, you know, one of
the quote unquote "good guys".

1210
01:07:36,008 --> 01:07:37,096
You surprise me, Barry.

1211
01:07:38,532 --> 01:07:42,754
There's a lot of
things in the original Godfather

1212
01:07:42,797 --> 01:07:45,539
that, they've
become iconic lines.

1213
01:07:45,887 --> 01:07:49,674
Yeah, well, never
hate your enemies.

1214
01:07:50,153 --> 01:07:51,197
It's not personal.

1215
01:07:52,503 --> 01:07:53,547
It's just business.

1216
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:56,352
We are able
to slip those things in,

1217
01:07:56,376 --> 01:07:58,422
and hopefully it's
something that, you know,

1218
01:07:58,465 --> 01:08:01,555
fans of the film will
sort of get the reference.

1219
01:08:01,947 --> 01:08:05,124
Making a reference
to The Godfather,

1220
01:08:05,168 --> 01:08:08,693
I feel like I've been doing
that my entire career.

1221
01:08:09,694 --> 01:08:12,392
There were, you know,
sort of winks and nods

1222
01:08:12,436 --> 01:08:13,436
and Easter eggs.

1223
01:08:14,786 --> 01:08:16,788
The intention of
the Easter eggs in The Offer

1224
01:08:17,310 --> 01:08:20,226
was meant to draw a parallel

1225
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:25,057
between the story in the film
and the story of the film.

1226
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:28,974
It's the final
scene of Episode 9.

1227
01:08:29,017 --> 01:08:31,759
Colombo's unconscious,
still sedated.

1228
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:34,197
The final moment of the scene

1229
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:38,114
is Al kissing
the hand of Colombo.

1230
01:08:39,724 --> 01:08:41,682
I wanted to compose a shot

1231
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:45,164
that echoed the final shot
in the film of The Godfather,

1232
01:08:45,208 --> 01:08:48,080
where Kay is in
the foreground out of focus,

1233
01:08:48,298 --> 01:08:50,648
and you see back into the room,

1234
01:08:50,691 --> 01:08:52,128
and before the door closes,

1235
01:08:52,171 --> 01:08:53,781
you see Clemenza kiss his hand.

1236
01:08:53,825 --> 01:08:56,175
Colombo is a real
friendship for him.

1237
01:08:56,523 --> 01:08:59,483
I developed a great
relationship with this man.

1238
01:08:59,787 --> 01:09:01,180
And without Colombo's help,

1239
01:09:01,224 --> 01:09:02,679
he never could have
got this movie made.

1240
01:09:02,703 --> 01:09:04,488
I genuinely respected him.

1241
01:09:04,531 --> 01:09:08,405
We became lasting
friends for a long time.

1242
01:09:08,448 --> 01:09:09,667
He pays homage.

1243
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:12,017
This really is one
of his godfathers,

1244
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:13,192
and maybe the biggest one.
