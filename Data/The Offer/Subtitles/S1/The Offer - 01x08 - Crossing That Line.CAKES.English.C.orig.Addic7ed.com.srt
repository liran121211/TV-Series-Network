1
00:00:03,406 --> 00:00:05,483
I heard from some of Gambino's guys

2
00:00:05,527 --> 00:00:07,367
that the old man's
not too happy with our move.

3
00:00:07,398 --> 00:00:09,618
Fuck him. This is an internal dispute.

4
00:00:09,661 --> 00:00:11,576
Francis, Sicily... Do we really need

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,274
- that whole section?
- Yes.

6
00:00:13,317 --> 00:00:15,624
It's so important to Michael's story.

7
00:00:17,495 --> 00:00:20,803
Hiya, Bob. What are you doing here?

8
00:00:20,846 --> 00:00:22,022
Is there somebody in there?

9
00:00:22,065 --> 00:00:23,501
Please, just go.

10
00:00:23,545 --> 00:00:25,068
You give everything to this business,

11
00:00:25,112 --> 00:00:26,678
and there's nothing left for me.

12
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,266
You sure you know what you're doing?

13
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,357
Lighten up, Ruddy.
You know what kings do?

14
00:00:31,382 --> 00:00:33,555
Whatever the fuck we want.

15
00:00:33,598 --> 00:00:35,383
You're fired.

16
00:00:35,426 --> 00:00:38,603
Get the fuck off my set.

17
00:00:38,647 --> 00:00:40,736
This isn't over, Evans.

18
00:00:40,779 --> 00:00:42,216
You have to learn early in life

19
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:43,671
if you're the kind of guy
who could hit somebody

20
00:00:43,695 --> 00:00:46,394
over the head with a baseball bat.

21
00:00:46,437 --> 00:00:47,960
I don't know if I could do that.

22
00:00:48,004 --> 00:00:50,311
I think that's why I like you.

23
00:00:50,354 --> 00:00:51,877
You gonna be at the rally tomorrow?

24
00:00:51,921 --> 00:00:53,248
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

25

26
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,146
Colombo! Colombo! Colombo!

27
00:03:24,726 --> 00:03:26,249
How can I help you boys?

28
00:03:26,293 --> 00:03:28,556
Did you see this guy at the rally?

29
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:31,689
Never seen him before. Who is he?

30
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:33,038
Name's Joe Gallo.

31
00:03:33,082 --> 00:03:36,128
He's a person of interest
in yesterday's shooting.

32
00:03:36,172 --> 00:03:38,914
Well, the guy
who shot Colombo was Black.

33
00:03:38,957 --> 00:03:40,655
- I saw him.
- Yeah, we know.

34
00:03:40,698 --> 00:03:43,048
We read the statement you gave the NYPD.

35
00:03:46,051 --> 00:03:48,576
You think this Gallo guy
had something to do with it?

36
00:03:48,619 --> 00:03:52,057
We're, uh, exploring all avenues.

37
00:03:52,687 --> 00:03:55,147
Listen, guys, I don't know
what this has to do with me.

38
00:03:55,191 --> 00:03:58,107
You're close with Colombo, right?

39
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,587
My only interaction with Colombo

40
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,066
has been about my movie.

41
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:02,310
Huh.

42
00:04:02,335 --> 00:04:05,125
Was that what you were talking
about when you had dinner at his home?

43
00:04:08,944 --> 00:04:11,033
That was a courtesy.

44
00:04:11,076 --> 00:04:12,643
That's what you say, but we have

45
00:04:12,687 --> 00:04:14,079
more surveillance footage on you

46
00:04:14,123 --> 00:04:17,735
than we do of some
of the boys in his crew.

47
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:20,390
Well, I don't know shit
about what goes on in his world.

48
00:04:20,434 --> 00:04:22,262
Well, then let me explain it to you.

49
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:25,003
Joey Gallo puts a hit
on a boss and he lives,

50
00:04:25,047 --> 00:04:28,050
there's no way
Colombo doesn't retaliate.

51
00:04:28,093 --> 00:04:30,792
Just make sure you're not standing
in the crossfire when he does.

52
00:04:30,835 --> 00:04:33,011
Hmm.

53
00:04:33,055 --> 00:04:34,361
Thanks, fellas.

54
00:04:43,587 --> 00:04:45,894
If you happen to remember anything,

55
00:04:45,937 --> 00:04:47,504
give us a call.

56
00:04:57,253 --> 00:04:58,733
Fuck.

57
00:05:03,773 --> 00:05:05,392
Robert, Robert, Robert.

58
00:05:05,435 --> 00:05:07,002
Nicholson's in.

59
00:05:07,045 --> 00:05:08,873
He is? Did he read the script?

60
00:05:08,917 --> 00:05:10,135
He didn't have to.

61
00:05:10,179 --> 00:05:11,243
I said, "Jack, baby, it's me, it's you",

62
00:05:11,267 --> 00:05:12,505
"it's Polanski, it's 'Chinatown.'

63
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:13,965
Let's do it!"Wait, wait, Polanski?

64
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:15,445
I think he's perfect for it.

65
00:05:15,489 --> 00:05:17,142
I loved "Rosemary's Baby."

66
00:05:17,186 --> 00:05:18,709
Well, you're welcome. Yeah, he's got

67
00:05:18,753 --> 00:05:21,103
a European point of view
on this country.

68
00:05:21,146 --> 00:05:23,453
And it ain't squeaky clean.

69
00:05:23,497 --> 00:05:25,586
- It's a dark story.
- Hey, lifesaver,

70
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:27,718
can I get a vodka martini
with a whisper of vermouth

71
00:05:27,762 --> 00:05:28,893
and a twist. Two?

72
00:05:28,937 --> 00:05:30,852
Uh, it's 11:00 a.m.

73
00:05:30,895 --> 00:05:33,985
- One.
- Yes, sir.

74
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:35,835
Everything okay in your world?

75
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,511
Yeah, yeah. Why wouldn't it be?

76
00:05:37,554 --> 00:05:40,688
Robert, Robert, Robert.
I love the script, man.

77
00:05:40,731 --> 00:05:42,646
I love the twists. I love the tone.

78
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,953
You've really elevated the idea of a PI.

79
00:05:44,996 --> 00:05:46,650
- Thanks.
- If there's one thing...

80
00:05:46,694 --> 00:05:48,957
Just one small thing...

81
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,960
The conspiracy is
a little hard to follow.

82
00:05:52,003 --> 00:05:53,918
So if you had to, just for me...

83
00:05:53,962 --> 00:05:56,399
If you had to talk about "Chinatown,"

84
00:05:56,443 --> 00:05:58,096
the themes, et cetera,

85
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,969
what would the pitch be, man?

86
00:06:01,012 --> 00:06:02,884
It's about something so essential

87
00:06:02,927 --> 00:06:05,452
that people need to live,

88
00:06:05,495 --> 00:06:07,584
the water supply in Los Angeles,

89
00:06:07,628 --> 00:06:10,370
being manipulated for the sake of power.

90
00:06:10,413 --> 00:06:12,720
- Here you are, sir.
- Uh, and the greed

91
00:06:12,763 --> 00:06:17,159
of these rarified, corrupt individuals

92
00:06:17,202 --> 00:06:20,554
who think they can manipulate
whoever they want to

93
00:06:20,597 --> 00:06:22,860
- like puppets.
- Yeah.

94
00:06:22,904 --> 00:06:27,212
Now, beyond that,
there's a certain fragile...

95
00:06:29,062 --> 00:06:31,478
There is no other place
that can double for Sicily.

96
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:33,523
We've been over this.
We can't afford it.

97
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:35,109
Well, where do you want
to shoot those scenes?

98
00:06:35,133 --> 00:06:37,266
In... in Palm Springs? Chatsworth?

99
00:06:37,309 --> 00:06:39,050
- I didn't say that.
- Okay.

100
00:06:39,094 --> 00:06:40,617
We have to shoot in Sicily.

101
00:06:40,661 --> 00:06:42,029
I mean, that's where
all the authenticity

102
00:06:42,053 --> 00:06:43,620
is gonna come from for this movie.

103
00:06:43,664 --> 00:06:45,187
Isn't that what Evans wants?

104
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,754
He wants to "smell the spaghetti."

105
00:06:46,797 --> 00:06:48,190
No. What he said was

106
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:49,907
we could go if we could
get there on the budget.

107
00:06:49,931 --> 00:06:51,672
Do you remember the budget?

108
00:06:51,715 --> 00:06:53,389
Do you remember telling Charlie
that any overages

109
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,458
would come out of our personal fees?

110
00:06:55,502 --> 00:06:59,941
Okay, so we get minimal crew,
you and me, Gordy,

111
00:06:59,984 --> 00:07:02,509
uh, Dean, Pacino. That's it.

112
00:07:02,552 --> 00:07:04,249
What about gaffers, costumes, lighting?

113
00:07:04,293 --> 00:07:06,469
Okay, Gordy can light
the whole thing with a matchbook.

114
00:07:06,513 --> 00:07:08,340
You're gonna save a lot of money

115
00:07:08,384 --> 00:07:09,622
because you won't have to dress the set.

116
00:07:09,646 --> 00:07:11,082
It's all authentic.

117
00:07:11,126 --> 00:07:13,520
Okay. Travel, lodging, fine.

118
00:07:13,563 --> 00:07:15,217
But then cast and crew all local.

119
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,307
That's 25K max.

120
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,024
Francis, we still have
a week left in New York.

121
00:07:20,048 --> 00:07:22,398
And $25,000 isn't nothing.

122
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,182
Please, I need this.

123
00:07:25,836 --> 00:07:28,491
You're very needy.

124
00:07:28,535 --> 00:07:31,059
But I get it. I hear you.

125
00:07:31,102 --> 00:07:32,713
And I'll find it.

126
00:07:33,931 --> 00:07:37,108
Grazie. Grazie amico.

127
00:07:37,152 --> 00:07:38,675
Get out.

128
00:07:49,207 --> 00:07:51,732
- Hey.
- Hey.

129
00:07:51,775 --> 00:07:54,430
How are you?

130
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,998
Good, just dealing
with some budget stuff.

131
00:07:56,022 --> 00:07:58,155
- Nothing new.
- Don't do that.

132
00:07:58,216 --> 00:08:01,568
Don't pretend you don't know
what I'm talking about.

133
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:03,439
Fucking Colombo.

134
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,794
I know.

135
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,488
One minute he's on stage,
king of the world,

136
00:08:08,531 --> 00:08:12,404
and the next...

137
00:08:12,448 --> 00:08:13,841
It's fucked up.

138
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:18,933
You should have called me.

139
00:08:18,976 --> 00:08:20,717
I was with the police till pretty late.

140
00:08:20,761 --> 00:08:24,939
That doesn't matter.

141
00:08:24,982 --> 00:08:28,246
- How is he?
- I don't know.

142
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,510
I'm gonna go see him
at the hospital later.

143
00:08:30,553 --> 00:08:32,773
Do you really think
you should be doing that?

144
00:08:32,816 --> 00:08:35,689
Just stay away.

145
00:08:35,732 --> 00:08:39,954
No. I can't not go.

146
00:08:39,997 --> 00:08:41,912
I'm fine.

147
00:08:41,956 --> 00:08:45,176
Look, we are fine.

148
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,613
Do you trust me?

149
00:08:48,136 --> 00:08:51,574
Yeah. It's them I don't trust.

150
00:08:54,577 --> 00:08:57,014
Look, we got a week left in New York.

151
00:08:57,058 --> 00:09:01,149
We'll just keep our heads down,
finish the job.

152
00:09:01,192 --> 00:09:03,194
Try and stay calm.

153
00:09:03,238 --> 00:09:07,372
If I'm drunk after lunch,
it's your fault.

154
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:08,983
I accept that.

155
00:09:09,026 --> 00:09:12,856
Come here.

156
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,685
You know, if there is a silver lining

157
00:09:15,729 --> 00:09:17,557
to any of this stuff,

158
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,300
at least we're done with the mob.

159
00:09:26,304 --> 00:09:28,560
He lost focus.

160
00:09:28,585 --> 00:09:32,111
Between that goddamn
Italian League and the movie,

161
00:09:32,136 --> 00:09:34,530
he was bringing too much heat.

162
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,227
It was time for him to go.

163
00:09:36,271 --> 00:09:38,752
A real boss would know
how to keep a low profile.

164
00:09:38,795 --> 00:09:41,493
Look...

165
00:09:41,537 --> 00:09:44,192
I agree he wasn't doing the right thing.

166
00:09:44,235 --> 00:09:45,846
But what's to say Gallo doesn't have

167
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:47,891
his sights set on one of us next?

168
00:09:50,198 --> 00:09:52,417
Let's find out.

169
00:09:52,461 --> 00:09:54,985
I saw we hear what Gallo's gotta say.

170
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:05,996
Joe, welcome.

171
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,258
- Joey.
- Hey.

172
00:10:07,302 --> 00:10:09,652
- How are you, kid?
- How you doing?

173
00:10:13,134 --> 00:10:17,486
I appreciate you all
taking this moment with me.

174
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:19,183
And all due respect, I understand

175
00:10:19,227 --> 00:10:21,969
why some of you might feel uncomfortable

176
00:10:22,012 --> 00:10:24,798
with me at this table.

177
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:29,200
I always had a great respect
for Joe Colombo.

178
00:10:29,544 --> 00:10:32,719
But he never understood
our way of doing things.

179
00:10:32,762 --> 00:10:36,592
And I want you all to know
that your way is... is my way.

180
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,682
A family of Blacks is not our way.

181
00:10:39,726 --> 00:10:43,773
They're not family. They're useful now.

182
00:10:43,817 --> 00:10:47,081
And I tell you, they earn more
than Colombo's guys ever did.

183
00:10:47,124 --> 00:10:50,824
But don't worry, I'll never
bring them here again.

184
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:57,265
Colombo never kicked up fairly
on the League.

185
00:10:57,308 --> 00:11:01,095
And he never shared the skim
from that fucking movie.

186
00:11:01,138 --> 00:11:04,228
But with me you get a fair shake.

187
00:11:04,272 --> 00:11:07,101
I'm a straight shooter.

188
00:11:07,144 --> 00:11:10,017
I saw we shut down the League.

189
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,106
It brings too much heat.

190
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:13,455
Oh, I hear that.

191
00:11:13,498 --> 00:11:14,804
And as for the movie,

192
00:11:14,848 --> 00:11:18,634
I promise we will all share equally.

193
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:22,290
You have my word.

194
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,596
I'll squeeze that prick producer dry.

195
00:11:34,349 --> 00:11:36,739
You can't fire Jack Ballard.

196
00:11:36,783 --> 00:11:37,914
Oops.

197
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:39,873
You should have run this by me.

198
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,483
Last time I checked, Jack Ballard,

199
00:11:41,526 --> 00:11:43,615
though your personal lap dog, Barry,

200
00:11:43,659 --> 00:11:45,400
was an employee of Paramount Pictures,

201
00:11:45,443 --> 00:11:46,575
not Gulf and Western.

202
00:11:46,618 --> 00:11:48,403
His title was Vice President.

203
00:11:48,446 --> 00:11:50,187
My title is Senior Vice President.

204
00:11:50,231 --> 00:11:53,060
Ergo, I can fire him, I did fire him,

205
00:11:53,103 --> 00:11:55,497
and now he's very, very fired.

206
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,760
You look like an unmade bed.

207
00:11:57,804 --> 00:11:59,719
What are you two lovers talking about?

208
00:11:59,762 --> 00:12:01,895
Your golden boy here fired Jack Ballard

209
00:12:01,938 --> 00:12:03,331
without consulting us.

210
00:12:03,374 --> 00:12:04,941
Well, I'm sorry he broke it off

211
00:12:04,985 --> 00:12:06,551
with your girlfriend.

212
00:12:06,595 --> 00:12:08,423
What do you got, Evans? What's next?

213
00:12:08,466 --> 00:12:10,444
You promised me and the board
lots and lots of money.

214
00:12:10,468 --> 00:12:12,732
"The Godfather" is, uh,
really coming together.

215
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:15,082
Yeah, no shit. Maybe I've heard of that.

216
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:16,692
Maybe I'm tired of hearing about that.

217
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,496
Maybe you can stop telling me
what I already know.

218
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,869
Next, next, next. What's next?

219
00:12:19,913 --> 00:12:22,002
I got a great script by Robert Towne.

220
00:12:22,045 --> 00:12:23,133
"Chinatown."

221
00:12:23,177 --> 00:12:24,656
Chinese food makes me fart.

222
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,136
Well, it's a thriller.

223
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:30,619
Nicholson's interested,
and I can get Polanski to direct it.

224
00:12:30,662 --> 00:12:32,882
Well, what is it?

225
00:12:32,926 --> 00:12:35,145
It's about water.

226
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:36,514
I mean, it's about more than that.

227
00:12:36,538 --> 00:12:38,540
There's... there's a mystery
in the center.

228
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:42,370
Uh, there's a guy,
um, Nicholson's character,

229
00:12:42,413 --> 00:12:46,113
and he's trying to find out
what's going on.

230
00:12:46,156 --> 00:12:47,679
Uh, it's Los Angeles.

231
00:12:47,723 --> 00:12:50,639
Uh, water in Los Angeles.

232
00:12:50,682 --> 00:12:54,774
And Nicholson.

233
00:12:57,127 --> 00:12:59,739
So why's it called "Chinatown"?

234
00:13:03,695 --> 00:13:07,177
It's about 200 people for a wrap party.

235
00:13:07,221 --> 00:13:09,179
Oh, like, when you're done
shooting a film

236
00:13:09,223 --> 00:13:11,138
and you want to celebrate.

237
00:13:11,181 --> 00:13:14,358
A DJ? Uh-huh.

238
00:13:14,402 --> 00:13:16,839
Okay, most importantly,
how much would an open bar cost?

239
00:13:16,883 --> 00:13:18,580
It's chilly in here.

240
00:13:18,623 --> 00:13:20,408
Just needs a little massage, that's all.

241
00:13:20,451 --> 00:13:21,713
Please don't do that.

242
00:13:21,757 --> 00:13:23,585
Hey, you give me a little prick,

243
00:13:23,628 --> 00:13:25,326
I give you a little prick.

244
00:13:25,369 --> 00:13:27,589
You know what I mean?

245
00:13:27,632 --> 00:13:29,939
Is it possible
for you to behave yourself?

246
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,680
Betty Boop.

247
00:13:31,723 --> 00:13:34,901
Depends on what I get in return.

248
00:13:34,944 --> 00:13:37,120
How about some general respect?

249
00:13:37,164 --> 00:13:40,167
I don't need that. I'm a movie star now.

250
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:43,257
You do realize your character dies?

251
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,259
And he's the biggest asshole
in the movie.

252
00:13:45,302 --> 00:13:46,826
Yeah, but he's an asshole

253
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:49,393
who gets killed by the main character.

254
00:13:49,437 --> 00:13:51,178
You okay, Boop?

255
00:13:51,221 --> 00:13:52,919
You look a little bit harried.

256
00:13:52,962 --> 00:13:54,746
I'm fine. Thank you.

257
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,836
Mr. Russo, could you turn around for me?

258
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:58,228
What a coincidence.

259
00:13:58,272 --> 00:14:00,752
I was just gonna ask you the same thing.

260
00:14:00,796 --> 00:14:02,537
But from this angle
you look pretty good.

261
00:14:08,369 --> 00:14:09,979
Ow! What the f...

262
00:14:10,023 --> 00:14:12,242
No one has time for your shit, Gianni.

263
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:13,940
- Ugh.
- Feel free to stab him

264
00:14:13,983 --> 00:14:15,289
if he opens his mouth again.

265
00:14:19,554 --> 00:14:21,861
She has a thing for me, trust me.

266
00:14:32,523 --> 00:14:34,221
Hey.

267
00:14:34,264 --> 00:14:36,440
- How is he?
- Not good.

268
00:14:39,341 --> 00:14:41,054
Can I go see him?

269
00:14:41,097 --> 00:14:45,275
No, they're not taking visitors yet,
but we'll let you know.

270
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:47,060
How late they hold you last night?

271
00:14:47,103 --> 00:14:48,757
I got out this morning.

272
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,281
It don't matter. They got nothing.

273
00:14:51,325 --> 00:14:52,717
How are you guys doing?

274
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:54,937
- Okay.
- This shit happens.

275
00:14:54,981 --> 00:14:57,505
Yeah, every ten years or so.

276
00:14:57,548 --> 00:14:59,768
So what happens now?

277
00:15:01,161 --> 00:15:03,424
Uh, you know, Al,

278
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:05,339
when you come to a line with us,

279
00:15:05,382 --> 00:15:07,515
you don't cross it.

280
00:15:07,558 --> 00:15:10,474
Because once you do,
you won't be able to cross back.

281
00:15:10,518 --> 00:15:14,000
Now, I could be wrong, but I don't think

282
00:15:14,043 --> 00:15:16,567
that's a line you want to cross.

283
00:15:16,611 --> 00:15:17,699
Am I right?

284
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,020
How're you doing?

285
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:37,030
Ah. Where's Evans?
He's supposed to be here.

286
00:15:37,066 --> 00:15:39,112
I don't know.

287
00:15:39,155 --> 00:15:42,158
Well, we're not waiting. Speak.

288
00:15:42,202 --> 00:15:43,899
We need a little more money

289
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,249
if we're gonna shoot
that whole sequence in Sicily.

290
00:15:46,293 --> 00:15:48,425
Then don't shoot in Sicily.

291
00:15:48,469 --> 00:15:50,427
If Evans can't be bothered to be here,

292
00:15:50,471 --> 00:15:52,168
then maybe I can't be bothered either.

293
00:15:52,212 --> 00:15:55,215
No, Charlie, listen,
we have to shoot in Sicily.

294
00:15:55,258 --> 00:15:57,539
It's the only way to achieve
the full vision of this film.

295
00:15:57,565 --> 00:16:00,089
Ruddy, where do I work?

296
00:16:00,133 --> 00:16:03,179
Come on, those big fat letters
behind the receptionist.

297
00:16:03,223 --> 00:16:06,052
- Gulf and Western.
- Great, you can read.

298
00:16:06,095 --> 00:16:08,968
So there's no excuse
for you coming to me again

299
00:16:09,018 --> 00:16:11,021
when you should be talking to the
head of Paramount fucking Pictures.

300
00:16:11,045 --> 00:16:12,052
Am I clear?

301
00:16:14,234 --> 00:16:17,628
Now come on. Cut the shit.

302
00:16:17,672 --> 00:16:20,936
Something's up with Evans.
What's happening there?

303
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,547
I don't know.

304
00:16:23,591 --> 00:16:26,246
Well, you better figure it out

305
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:28,813
or I will.

306
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,350
Hey, Talia.

307
00:16:45,613 --> 00:16:47,049
What happened? How'd it go?

308
00:16:47,093 --> 00:16:48,311
I'm not sure.

309
00:16:48,355 --> 00:16:49,834
The scene was pretty intense.

310
00:16:49,893 --> 00:16:52,939
- Should I go check on her?
- No, I'm gonna go.

311
00:16:52,968 --> 00:16:56,580
Hey, have you seen Bob today?

312
00:17:00,628 --> 00:17:03,500
Talia?

313
00:17:03,544 --> 00:17:05,502
Is everything okay?

314
00:17:05,546 --> 00:17:09,028
Gianni hit me.

315
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:11,117
He actually fucking hit me in the face.

316
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,076
Oh, my God.

317
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,079
Why didn't you say anything on set?

318
00:17:17,123 --> 00:17:21,127
I didn't want to ruin the shot.

319
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,216
You know, I know it sounds stupid,

320
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:26,262
but it felt like
he actually wanted to hit me.

321
00:17:26,325 --> 00:17:30,546
Like he enjoyed it.

322
00:17:30,571 --> 00:17:31,659
Hey.

323
00:17:35,141 --> 00:17:36,577
I'm gonna say something.

324
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,926
- No.
- Mm-hmm.

325
00:17:37,969 --> 00:17:40,494
No, please don't.

326
00:17:40,537 --> 00:17:43,975
Francis already risked so much
to put me in the movie.

327
00:17:46,195 --> 00:17:48,632
I'm fine, really.

328
00:17:52,984 --> 00:17:54,160
He did what?

329
00:17:54,203 --> 00:17:55,900
I want to fire him myself.

330
00:17:55,944 --> 00:17:58,164
What a fucking prick.

331
00:17:58,207 --> 00:18:00,601
- Is she okay?
- She's pissed.

332
00:18:00,644 --> 00:18:02,777
But she didn't want
to rock the boat for you.

333
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,126
Does she need a medic?

334
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,475
No.

335
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:07,260
She didn't even want me to say anything.

336
00:18:07,303 --> 00:18:10,785
What the hell are we gonna do?

337
00:18:10,828 --> 00:18:12,178
I got an idea.

338
00:18:12,221 --> 00:18:14,310
And we're gonna keep it in the family.

339
00:18:16,486 --> 00:18:18,619
I will handle this. Trust me.

340
00:18:20,534 --> 00:18:22,579
I'm gonna go check on her.

341
00:18:22,623 --> 00:18:25,016
Okay. Fuck.

342
00:18:25,994 --> 00:18:28,455
We also need to look at the budget ASAP,

343
00:18:28,498 --> 00:18:32,111
see if we can squeeze
any more dough for Sicily.

344
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:34,678
All the departments
are already overextended.

345
00:18:34,722 --> 00:18:36,202
Wardrobe, design...

346
00:18:36,245 --> 00:18:37,768
They're all looking for more money.

347
00:18:37,812 --> 00:18:39,335
I know.

348
00:18:39,379 --> 00:18:42,164
And that's why we're gonna
have to get creative.

349
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,732
Jimmy Caan in here?

350
00:18:44,775 --> 00:18:47,300
Can you give us a sec? Thanks, buddy.

351
00:18:47,343 --> 00:18:50,390
Ah, Mr. Producer.

352
00:18:50,433 --> 00:18:52,261
What, you got notes or something?

353
00:18:52,305 --> 00:18:53,871
Yeah.

354
00:18:53,915 --> 00:18:56,613
I'm gonna need a little help
on the next scene.

355
00:18:56,657 --> 00:18:58,528
Anything for you, buddy.

356
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,682
Uh, we're about to roll. You good?

357
00:19:07,363 --> 00:19:09,713
Can you two switch?

358
00:19:09,757 --> 00:19:12,586
First positions, you guys.

359
00:19:12,629 --> 00:19:14,936
You guys good?

360
00:19:14,979 --> 00:19:16,894
And we're rolling!

361
00:19:16,938 --> 00:19:18,418
I like that fire hydrant.

362
00:19:18,461 --> 00:19:21,290
Yeah, adds a little authentic texture.

363
00:19:21,334 --> 00:19:23,031
Anything on Sicily?

364
00:19:23,074 --> 00:19:24,946
- I'm working on it.
- Hey, go ahead.

365
00:19:24,989 --> 00:19:27,253
And action.

366
00:19:27,296 --> 00:19:28,732
All right.

367
00:19:28,776 --> 00:19:30,169
Yeah, I like that broom handle.

368
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:31,344
There he goes.

369
00:19:31,387 --> 00:19:33,781
Oh! That's a good takedown.

370
00:19:33,824 --> 00:19:35,348
That's not what we rehearsed.

371
00:19:35,391 --> 00:19:36,871
Those kicks look good.

372
00:19:36,914 --> 00:19:38,655
- Very authentic.
- Yeah.

373
00:19:38,699 --> 00:19:39,917
Jesus.

374
00:19:39,961 --> 00:19:42,137
Looks like Caan
is really hitting Gianni.

375
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,660
That's because he is.

376
00:19:43,704 --> 00:19:45,009
What's he doing now?

377
00:19:45,053 --> 00:19:47,229
Yeah.

378
00:19:47,273 --> 00:19:48,752
Looks like he's yanking his foot.

379
00:19:48,796 --> 00:19:51,451
Is his shoe supposed to...

380
00:19:51,494 --> 00:19:54,236
Definitely not what we rehearsed.

381
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,717
Francis, uh, think we got it?

382
00:19:58,762 --> 00:19:59,937
Give it another minute.

383
00:20:02,331 --> 00:20:03,593
Holy shit.

384
00:20:03,637 --> 00:20:05,291
We're gonna need a medic in here.

385
00:20:05,334 --> 00:20:07,088
I just said give it another minute.

386
00:20:08,294 --> 00:20:10,426
It's a good scene.

387
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:13,386
Beautiful scene. It's my favorite scene.

388
00:20:13,429 --> 00:20:15,562
Take a break.

389
00:20:25,311 --> 00:20:26,964
That looked pretty painful.

390
00:20:27,008 --> 00:20:28,488
It's called committing to the part.

391
00:20:28,531 --> 00:20:29,924
Mm.

392
00:20:29,949 --> 00:20:32,883
That's some method shit
right there, hand to God.

393
00:20:32,927 --> 00:20:35,712
Hey, can you help me out here, Boop?

394
00:20:35,756 --> 00:20:38,106
My arm...

395
00:20:43,372 --> 00:20:45,548
That a girl.

396
00:20:45,592 --> 00:20:47,768
Jimmy Caan beat me up.

397
00:20:47,811 --> 00:20:51,032
Jimmy fucking Caan.

398
00:20:51,075 --> 00:20:52,381
How cool is that?

399
00:20:52,425 --> 00:20:54,209
Ah, fuck!

400
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,994
The next time you even think
about hitting a woman,

401
00:20:57,038 --> 00:20:59,780
- you remember that feeling.
- Ah! Fuck!

402
00:20:59,823 --> 00:21:01,042
Fucking bitch.

403
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:15,578
The accountant laughed when I
asked if we had any extra money.

404
00:21:16,738 --> 00:21:19,539
He suggested I sell
my future first-born.

405
00:21:19,582 --> 00:21:21,323
Mm. Then just to prove his point,

406
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:23,456
he proceeded to go over
all the books with me

407
00:21:23,499 --> 00:21:24,705
in great detail.

408
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:27,634
And that is two hours of my life
I will never get back.

409
00:21:27,677 --> 00:21:29,549
He's right. That's what we do.

410
00:21:29,592 --> 00:21:31,178
I'm not saying
I want to be a mother, but...

411
00:21:31,202 --> 00:21:34,467
No, not the child, the future.

412
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,120
You ever play the stock market?

413
00:21:36,164 --> 00:21:37,296
Like, with Monopoly money?

414
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:39,298
Better. A promise.

415
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:42,344
We get the money because
we make a promise for the future.

416
00:21:42,388 --> 00:21:44,607
In the stock market,
you can buy futures,

417
00:21:44,651 --> 00:21:46,455
meaning you're betting
something is going to be

418
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:47,741
worth more later.

419
00:21:47,784 --> 00:21:49,656
For vendors, production is like that.

420
00:21:49,699 --> 00:21:51,266
There's supply and demand.

421
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,963
We, the customers, we demand.

422
00:21:53,007 --> 00:21:54,965
Lumber, cameras, lighting.

423
00:21:55,009 --> 00:21:56,880
They, the vendors, they supply.

424
00:21:56,924 --> 00:21:58,839
And how do they keep making money?

425
00:21:58,882 --> 00:22:00,536
By making sure in the future
we don't use

426
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,016
a different supplier.

427
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:03,054
- Ruddy.
- Hey.

428
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:04,733
Great to see you.

429
00:22:04,758 --> 00:22:07,674
Production doesn't pay
all its bills upfront.

430
00:22:07,717 --> 00:22:08,955
And when you're still holding the money,

431
00:22:08,979 --> 00:22:10,372
Thanks, my friend.

432
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:11,418
There's always a chance to negotiate.

433
00:22:11,442 --> 00:22:12,467
Appreciate your business.

434
00:22:12,492 --> 00:22:14,177
Thank you. Anytime.

435
00:22:14,202 --> 00:22:16,987
You mean... like, a threat?

436
00:22:17,031 --> 00:22:19,120
No, like a guarantee.

437
00:22:19,163 --> 00:22:21,296
We get a discount
on the money we owe right now,

438
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,430
because we guarantee our business
on the next movie.

439
00:22:24,473 --> 00:22:25,822
Next movie?

440
00:22:25,866 --> 00:22:27,868
What, you set one up
when I wasn't looking?

441
00:22:27,911 --> 00:22:31,437
Not yet, but they don't know that.

442
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,091
Thanks, buddy. Been a pleasure.
Appreciate it.

443
00:22:39,662 --> 00:22:42,361
And the total discounts come to...

444
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:47,409
$26,423.

445
00:22:47,453 --> 00:22:48,715
- Look at that.
- Wow.

446
00:22:48,758 --> 00:22:51,326
If you were a broker, you'd
be making a lot more money.

447
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,485
Food for thought if this gig
doesn't work out.

448
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,263
You got everything booked
for the wrap party?

449
00:22:56,287 --> 00:22:58,072
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, good.

450
00:22:58,115 --> 00:22:59,465
I want to make sure the crew has

451
00:22:59,508 --> 00:23:01,554
a nice New York send-off
before we head to Sicily.

452
00:23:01,597 --> 00:23:03,321
Yes, Your Majesty.

453
00:23:03,346 --> 00:23:05,576
I got us a deal with that open bar.

454
00:23:05,601 --> 00:23:08,474
That's my girl.

455
00:23:08,517 --> 00:23:10,737
Are you headed back to the hotel?

456
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,173
Yeah. Looking forward

457
00:23:12,216 --> 00:23:14,436
to a good night's sleep for once.

458
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,091
- Have you heard from Bob?
- No.

459
00:23:17,134 --> 00:23:18,962
Something's going on with him.

460
00:23:19,006 --> 00:23:21,443
I gotta figure it out.

461
00:23:21,487 --> 00:23:23,532
- Night, Bettye.
- Night, Rud.

462
00:23:35,805 --> 00:23:38,547
What? Get off.

463
00:23:38,591 --> 00:23:40,984
What's going on?

464
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:44,379
All right.

465
00:23:47,164 --> 00:23:50,820
What's going on?

466
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:55,259
You know who I am?

467
00:23:57,087 --> 00:23:59,002
I got an idea.

468
00:24:00,613 --> 00:24:05,128
Just for formalities, I'm Joe Gallo.

469
00:24:05,922 --> 00:24:08,751
And I'm in charge of your movie now,

470
00:24:08,795 --> 00:24:11,450
which means whatever
you were giving Colombo,

471
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:13,626
you now give to me.

472
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:18,500
Well, Mr. Gallo,

473
00:24:18,544 --> 00:24:20,633
I wasn't giving Colombo anything.

474
00:24:22,896 --> 00:24:24,767
Honestly, I'm not trying

475
00:24:24,811 --> 00:24:26,508
to be disrespectful
or anything, Mr. Gallo,

476
00:24:26,552 --> 00:24:28,510
but, truthfully,

477
00:24:28,554 --> 00:24:31,818
I never gave Colombo
any money or anything.

478
00:24:31,861 --> 00:24:34,603
All I did was I worked a deal with him

479
00:24:34,647 --> 00:24:36,823
to eliminate any words from the script

480
00:24:36,858 --> 00:24:41,828
that he felt might be offensive
to guys like yourself.

481
00:24:42,829 --> 00:24:43,960
That was it.

482
00:24:45,962 --> 00:24:48,399
Don't fuck with me, Al!

483
00:24:48,443 --> 00:24:51,098
I do not enjoy repeating myself.

484
00:24:53,197 --> 00:24:54,981
I think I make my point.

485
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,452
Right, Al?

486
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,759
Al, say it.

487
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:04,415
- You made your point.
- Good.

488
00:25:04,459 --> 00:25:05,741
But, honestly,
we're almost done filming.

489
00:25:05,765 --> 00:25:06,940
There's no money.

490
00:25:06,983 --> 00:25:09,551
Sounds like not my fucking problem.

491
00:25:10,852 --> 00:25:15,683
Next time I see you,
you have my end, right?

492
00:25:15,992 --> 00:25:17,254
- Right?
- Right.

493
00:25:17,298 --> 00:25:20,344
All right. Good night, Al.

494
00:25:21,128 --> 00:25:24,196
Sleep well. You look like shit.

495
00:25:41,148 --> 00:25:43,454
Sorry for calling you so late, but...

496
00:25:43,498 --> 00:25:45,587
you're really the only person
I can talk to.

497
00:25:47,023 --> 00:25:48,895
Same for me.

498
00:25:56,772 --> 00:25:58,731
So what does this guy Gallo want?

499
00:26:02,169 --> 00:26:04,606
Money. From the production.

500
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:08,262
There is no money.

501
00:26:08,305 --> 00:26:11,134
Except what we have left for Sicily.

502
00:26:11,178 --> 00:26:14,224
- Jesus.
- I know.

503
00:26:18,228 --> 00:26:19,447
Are we safe?

504
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,297
Honestly, I don't know anymore.

505
00:26:28,133 --> 00:26:29,892
Are you gonna give him the money?

506
00:26:32,503 --> 00:26:33,679
I don't know.

507
00:26:36,246 --> 00:26:39,336
For the first time making this thing,
I don't know what the fuck to do.

508
00:26:41,164 --> 00:26:44,254
And the one guy that can help me
is in the fucking hospital.

509
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:49,259
I need to talk to Joe.

510
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:52,567
You're sure that's a good idea?

511
00:26:55,483 --> 00:26:57,659
Caesar told me
that I was coming up to a line

512
00:26:57,703 --> 00:27:00,227
that I probably didn't want to cross.

513
00:27:02,925 --> 00:27:05,972
But, honestly, I think
I crossed that line

514
00:27:06,015 --> 00:27:08,148
a long time ago.

515
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:14,562
And what the hell
happened to you last night?

516
00:28:14,612 --> 00:28:16,963
- Huh?
- Me?

517
00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:18,740
Bob, where the hell have you been?

518
00:28:18,784 --> 00:28:20,239
Where the hell have I been?
Where the hell have you been?

519
00:28:20,263 --> 00:28:22,396
I called you.
Told you all about it last night.

520
00:28:22,439 --> 00:28:23,484
Screening, "Plaza Suite."

521
00:28:23,527 --> 00:28:25,660
You stood me up, son of a bitch.

522
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,445
No. You never told me any of that.

523
00:28:28,489 --> 00:28:32,319
Well, then it's a fucking mystery, huh?

524
00:28:32,362 --> 00:28:35,626
How're you doing?

525
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:36,889
What do you mean?

526
00:28:36,932 --> 00:28:40,631
I mean are you feeling all right?

527
00:28:40,675 --> 00:28:43,286
Movies, movies, more movies, bubbe.

528
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:45,549
Working hard making magic. Wa-pa-pow.

529
00:28:47,943 --> 00:28:50,875
Yeah. Gum.

530
00:28:52,295 --> 00:28:53,949
You trying to tell me something?

531
00:28:53,993 --> 00:28:55,100
I'm just trying to be polite.

532
00:28:55,124 --> 00:28:56,822
I don't trust polite.

533
00:28:56,865 --> 00:29:00,086
Polite people never tell you
what they're thinking.

534
00:29:00,129 --> 00:29:03,176
Ever.

535
00:29:03,219 --> 00:29:06,222
Call time pushed a little bit.
You got time to go back to the hotel.

536
00:29:06,266 --> 00:29:07,789
Rest up.

537
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:09,704
Yeah, maybe I'll do that.

538
00:29:14,056 --> 00:29:15,666
See you on set.

539
00:29:18,017 --> 00:29:20,976
Bob...

540
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,239
Charlie asked me about you.

541
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:29,898
Crazy Austrian's obsessed with me.

542
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:41,040
Let's stack 'em up.

543
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:42,323
These go in front of the truck.

544
00:29:43,694 --> 00:29:45,827
Buon giorno.

545
00:29:45,871 --> 00:29:49,570
You been practicing your Italian yet?

546
00:29:49,613 --> 00:29:50,876
Francis, I hate to say this,

547
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:53,008
but we may need to shoot
those Sicily scenes here.

548
00:29:53,052 --> 00:29:55,097
No. Everything is new here.

549
00:29:55,141 --> 00:29:56,466
The buildings are new,
and the sidewalks are new,

550
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:57,902
- and the trees are new...
- I can't do...

551
00:29:57,926 --> 00:29:59,512
- I can't do this right now.
- I said that I needed it.

552
00:29:59,536 --> 00:30:00,711
You said you'd get it!

553
00:30:00,755 --> 00:30:04,237
I said I can't do this right now!

554
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,780
I'm tired of throwing myself on the fire

555
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,763
ever fucking day on this thing.

556
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,088
And if you think
you know what that means,

557
00:30:10,112 --> 00:30:12,811
trust me, you don't know the half of it.

558
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:30,828
Al... you know what is necessary

559
00:30:31,133 --> 00:30:34,658
to get the job done.
Sicily is a necessity.

560
00:30:34,702 --> 00:30:36,530
We have to see Michael...

561
00:30:36,573 --> 00:30:39,968
We... we have to see
that last chance of happiness

562
00:30:40,012 --> 00:30:42,318
go up in flames.

563
00:30:42,362 --> 00:30:45,713
His heart turned to ice and stone.

564
00:30:45,756 --> 00:30:48,977
He has to live in Sicily

565
00:30:49,021 --> 00:30:51,414
in order to feel that beauty evaporate.

566
00:30:51,458 --> 00:30:55,810
And we have to live in his skin

567
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,507
in order to feel that pain.

568
00:30:57,551 --> 00:30:58,900
And this movie...

569
00:30:58,944 --> 00:31:00,815
Without Sicily
it doesn't live or breathe.

570
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,164
I need it.

571
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:04,732
Please, Al. I'm begging you.

572
00:31:04,775 --> 00:31:06,101
If we don't shoot it there,
they're gonna cut

573
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:07,909
this whole sequence from the movie.

574
00:31:07,953 --> 00:31:11,217
And for us to get this far...

575
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:14,797
Please, I... I...
I just can't give it up.

576
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:19,094
I can't find the money.

577
00:31:24,665 --> 00:31:26,580
I'm sorry.

578
00:31:36,851 --> 00:31:41,247
I know you're gonna find a way.

579
00:32:14,845 --> 00:32:17,587
Hey, Joe.

580
00:32:17,631 --> 00:32:20,460
How you doing, buddy?

581
00:32:20,503 --> 00:32:22,592
It's Al.

582
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,373
Can he hear me?

583
00:32:31,384 --> 00:32:33,168
How long's he gonna be like this?

584
00:32:33,212 --> 00:32:34,996
The doctors have no fucking clue.

585
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,999
Come here. There's, um...

586
00:32:38,043 --> 00:32:40,567
There's a lot going on right now.

587
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:42,612
Stuff we shouldn't
really be talking about.

588
00:32:42,656 --> 00:32:44,745
But I want you to be careful, all right?

589
00:32:44,788 --> 00:32:48,183
There's this guy, and he's no good.

590
00:32:48,227 --> 00:32:50,142
- Joe Gallo.
- Uh-huh.

591
00:32:50,185 --> 00:32:52,100
Yeah, unfortunately I met him already.

592
00:32:52,144 --> 00:32:53,667
He showed up at my hotel room

593
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:55,016
asking for money from the film.

594
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,713
Okay, listen to me.

595
00:32:56,757 --> 00:32:59,499
Right now, just do whatever Gallo asks.

596
00:32:59,542 --> 00:33:01,022
You can't fuck with this guy, Al.

597
00:33:01,066 --> 00:33:02,589
He's crazy.

598
00:33:02,632 --> 00:33:04,895
We don't have any money left.

599
00:33:04,939 --> 00:33:06,395
The only little bit of change I got left

600
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:07,613
is ear-marked for Sicily, and I can't...

601
00:33:07,637 --> 00:33:10,640
You got no choice.

602
00:33:12,077 --> 00:33:13,352
Hey.

603
00:33:15,384 --> 00:33:17,517
Do me a favor.

604
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:21,173
Will you give this to Bettye for me
when you see her around?

605
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,906
What is this?

606
00:33:23,931 --> 00:33:25,500
Just let her know that she can wear it

607
00:33:25,525 --> 00:33:27,657
anywhere in the world. Except Miami.

608
00:33:27,701 --> 00:33:29,703
Miami's no good. You got it?

609
00:33:29,746 --> 00:33:31,835
I got it.

610
00:33:34,142 --> 00:33:36,536
Is it all right if I sit
with him for a little bit?

611
00:33:56,293 --> 00:33:58,250
Why is he giving you a watch?

612
00:33:59,167 --> 00:34:00,560
'Cause my other one broke.

613
00:34:03,302 --> 00:34:04,999
Thank God I didn't have
any immediate plans

614
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:08,872
for Florida, huh?

615
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:10,265
Wow.

616
00:34:13,138 --> 00:34:15,140
How the hell did we get here?

617
00:34:15,183 --> 00:34:17,185
What do you mean?

618
00:34:17,229 --> 00:34:20,101
We started out getting shot at
by Mickey Cohen.

619
00:34:22,495 --> 00:34:25,063
And now I'm getting gifts
from gangsters.

620
00:34:28,283 --> 00:34:29,632
It's better than the alternative,

621
00:34:29,676 --> 00:34:31,939
trust me.

622
00:34:33,723 --> 00:34:35,290
Fuck Sicily.

623
00:34:37,858 --> 00:34:40,034
Give Gallo the money.

624
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,688
It's just a movie.

625
00:34:47,297 --> 00:34:49,996
I have a feeling this money
isn't gonna be the end of it.

626
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,971
- Ever got shot before?
- No.

627
00:35:04,014 --> 00:35:07,279
I've imagined the bullet,
but never been shot.

628
00:35:07,322 --> 00:35:08,889
Have you?

629
00:35:08,932 --> 00:35:11,457
Not yet, but the day is young.

630
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,328
You know what the trick is, Al?

631
00:35:13,372 --> 00:35:15,200
The best way to survive it all?

632
00:35:15,243 --> 00:35:17,158
- Tell me.
- Don't get shot.

633
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,640
Good advice.

634
00:35:20,683 --> 00:35:23,817
Hey, Brando!

635
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,167
Moon champion, my ass.

636
00:35:26,211 --> 00:35:27,255
Actors.

637
00:35:30,998 --> 00:35:32,217
Excuse me.

638
00:35:35,609 --> 00:35:39,482
Hey, this is cool, man,

639
00:35:39,659 --> 00:35:42,227
the way they made this look
like an old-time street.

640
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:43,619
It's not bad, right?

641
00:35:43,663 --> 00:35:44,727
We got a good production designer...

642
00:35:44,751 --> 00:35:45,926
I don't give a shit.

643
00:35:45,969 --> 00:35:47,580
Where's my fucking money?

644
00:35:49,234 --> 00:35:52,454
Look, I'm trying to get you the money.

645
00:35:52,498 --> 00:35:54,500
I just need more time.

646
00:35:54,543 --> 00:35:55,999
And I'm not fucking with you,
I swear to God.

647
00:35:56,023 --> 00:35:58,373
I just... We're strapped really thin.

648
00:35:58,417 --> 00:36:00,984
I can't move it that quick.

649
00:36:01,028 --> 00:36:02,551
You got till midnight.

650
00:36:06,294 --> 00:36:08,340
Okay. After this
we're done though, right?

651
00:36:08,383 --> 00:36:10,559
Hell no, Al.

652
00:36:10,603 --> 00:36:13,994
This is the start
of a beautiful friendship.

653
00:36:16,261 --> 00:36:18,393
Hey, you know what today is?

654
00:36:18,437 --> 00:36:19,829
It's my birthday.

655
00:36:19,873 --> 00:36:21,546
Yeah, we're gonna be
celebrating at Umberto's,

656
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:23,268
right around the corner.

657
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:26,140
Why don't you come by after work?

658
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,489
Bring the dough.

659
00:36:27,533 --> 00:36:29,535
Maybe I'll let you buy me
some baked clams.

660
00:36:30,753 --> 00:36:33,234
See you around, Al.

661
00:36:33,278 --> 00:36:34,627
Don't be late.

662
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,219
Scusi, grazie.

663
00:37:01,262 --> 00:37:04,613
Thank you for your patience.

664
00:37:04,657 --> 00:37:07,225
Good. Take from the side here, Papa.

665
00:37:07,268 --> 00:37:09,618
Beautiful.

666
00:37:11,272 --> 00:37:12,771
Oh, Francis, do you want me by the door?

667
00:37:12,795 --> 00:37:14,144
Yes, yes.

668
00:37:14,188 --> 00:37:16,103
And he gets the fruit, and then you...

669
00:37:16,146 --> 00:37:17,466
Jump out of the car with the gun.

670
00:37:17,496 --> 00:37:18,801
- After...
- Drop it, right.

671
00:37:18,826 --> 00:37:19,915
After. Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

672
00:37:19,939 --> 00:37:21,984
Okay. Start rolling.

673
00:37:23,937 --> 00:37:25,939
And action!

674
00:37:29,856 --> 00:37:31,640
Look at this,
the whole thing... everything.

675
00:38:12,464 --> 00:38:14,379
Joe Colombo says goodbye, fuckhead.

676
00:38:18,861 --> 00:38:20,994
And cut! Yes!

677
00:38:21,037 --> 00:38:23,301
Whoo!

678
00:38:23,344 --> 00:38:25,607
Whoo!

679
00:38:25,651 --> 00:38:29,481
Bravo. Magnificent.

680
00:38:29,524 --> 00:38:31,787
Bravo.

681
00:38:44,234 --> 00:38:46,585
Five years, tops, and Napa Valley

682
00:38:46,628 --> 00:38:49,414
will be competing with
the finest wines in France.

683
00:38:49,457 --> 00:38:51,329
It's got legs.

684
00:38:51,372 --> 00:38:53,026
American Cabernet
is so under-appreciated.

685
00:38:53,069 --> 00:38:54,419
You got a scotch, please?

686
00:38:54,462 --> 00:38:58,510
Ooh, leather, currants,
little bit of cinnamon.

687
00:38:58,553 --> 00:38:59,772
- Smell that.
- Okay, yep.

688
00:38:59,815 --> 00:39:02,383
- Hey! Make it a double.
- Suit yourself.

689
00:39:02,427 --> 00:39:04,951
So we going to Sicily?

690
00:39:04,994 --> 00:39:06,344
Well, I'm waiting on Ruddy to see

691
00:39:06,387 --> 00:39:07,910
how it's gonna work out.

692
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:10,775
- Saluti.
- Salut.

693
00:39:10,826 --> 00:39:13,220
Oh, no. Okay. Okay, Dean.

694
00:39:13,263 --> 00:39:14,395
Yeah.

695
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:16,049
Excuse me.

696
00:39:16,092 --> 00:39:19,008
Can I get a Bacardi 151, please?

697
00:39:19,052 --> 00:39:20,140
Thank you.

698
00:39:20,183 --> 00:39:21,924
Well, that's a serious drink.

699
00:39:21,968 --> 00:39:25,580
Are you a serious woman?

700
00:39:25,624 --> 00:39:27,974
I just like to cut to the chase.

701
00:39:28,017 --> 00:39:30,106
Hmm. I see.

702
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:31,543
What are you chasing?

703
00:39:31,586 --> 00:39:35,895
A big, fat buzz. You care to join me?

704
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,941
You, uh... you got Disaronno?

705
00:39:38,985 --> 00:39:40,160
Yes, sir, we do.

706
00:39:40,203 --> 00:39:42,249
Equal parts Disaronno and scotch on ice.

707
00:39:42,292 --> 00:39:44,338
- Coming right up.
- What do you call that?

708
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,166
A delivery system.

709
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:51,998
You know what one of my favorite things

710
00:39:52,041 --> 00:39:53,608
about this movie has been?

711
00:39:55,305 --> 00:39:57,395
Watching you.

712
00:39:57,438 --> 00:39:59,484
There's nothing dishonest
in anything you did.

713
00:39:59,527 --> 00:40:02,791
You just live it moment to moment.

714
00:40:04,783 --> 00:40:08,884
You couldn't see the acting,
just the truth.

715
00:40:08,928 --> 00:40:11,104
You have a real understanding
of the craft.

716
00:40:13,149 --> 00:40:14,890
You know...

717
00:40:14,934 --> 00:40:17,719
Michelangelo was once asked

718
00:40:17,763 --> 00:40:21,462
"How do you sculpt such beauty
out of stone?"

719
00:40:21,506 --> 00:40:23,682
Know what he said?

720
00:40:23,725 --> 00:40:27,337
He said, "I don't sculpt anything."

721
00:40:27,381 --> 00:40:29,992
"I just see the truth within the stone,

722
00:40:30,036 --> 00:40:32,560
and chip everything else away."

723
00:40:33,779 --> 00:40:35,781
Wow.

724
00:40:35,824 --> 00:40:38,305
Hey, Marlon! Marlon!

725
00:40:40,263 --> 00:40:43,179
I think you have a fan waiting for you.

726
00:40:43,223 --> 00:40:45,921
Well, I think you have
a fan of your own.

727
00:40:51,623 --> 00:40:53,668
Charlie... Charlie, you were my brother.

728
00:40:53,712 --> 00:40:55,801
You were supposed to look out for me.

729
00:40:55,844 --> 00:40:57,455
What? What?

730
00:40:57,498 --> 00:40:58,649
What the fuck's happened now?

731
00:40:58,673 --> 00:40:59,674
How much have you drank?

732
00:40:59,718 --> 00:41:00,806
Oh, have one of these.

733
00:41:10,555 --> 00:41:13,514
Whoo!

734
00:41:13,558 --> 00:41:14,863
- I see you.
- Ohh.

735
00:41:14,907 --> 00:41:16,474
There she is. My baby girl.

736
00:41:16,517 --> 00:41:17,799
Am I gonna get to have a dance...

737
00:41:17,823 --> 00:41:19,215
- That's my baby.
- With Mr. Evans?

738
00:41:19,259 --> 00:41:21,043
All right, let's do it.

739
00:41:21,087 --> 00:41:22,523
- You look amazing.
- Thank you.

740
00:41:22,567 --> 00:41:23,767
You look like a million bucks.

741
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,354
Goddamn.

742
00:41:36,015 --> 00:41:37,712
Hey, Mr. Ruddy, good to see you.

743
00:41:39,714 --> 00:41:44,023
Whiskey, four fingers.

744
00:41:46,808 --> 00:41:48,984
What happened?

745
00:41:49,331 --> 00:41:51,986
Sorry, Francis, I can't make it happen.

746
00:41:53,772 --> 00:41:56,557
I tried.

747
00:42:04,043 --> 00:42:05,479
Jesus fuck.

748
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:08,047
Who killed his puppy, huh?

749
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:09,875
He's disappointed about Sicily.

750
00:42:09,918 --> 00:42:11,616
Yeah.

751
00:42:11,659 --> 00:42:13,463
Maybe if you showed up
to the meeting with Charlie,

752
00:42:13,487 --> 00:42:16,011
or maybe if you'd showed up
to fucking anything lately,

753
00:42:16,055 --> 00:42:17,230
things would be different.

754
00:42:17,273 --> 00:42:18,468
Hey, don't put this on me, pal.

755
00:42:18,492 --> 00:42:19,556
I told you to find
the money in the budget.

756
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,060
You're the one who fucked up here.

757
00:42:21,103 --> 00:42:22,452
Let's not do this now.

758
00:42:22,496 --> 00:42:23,778
Well, there's no time
like the present, bud.

759
00:42:23,802 --> 00:42:25,040
You gonna... you gonna hand in
an unfinished movie?

760
00:42:25,064 --> 00:42:27,501
Yeah? Great, great.

761
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:28,633
Let's talk outside.

762
00:42:28,676 --> 00:42:29,982
Why?

763
00:42:30,025 --> 00:42:31,133
'Cause I need some fresh air.

764
00:42:31,157 --> 00:42:32,637
I'm not going anywhere.

765
00:42:34,247 --> 00:42:36,205
Listen, I don't know
what's going on with you,

766
00:42:36,249 --> 00:42:38,089
or you and Ali
or whatever happened in Texas...

767
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,905
My marriage is none
of your fucking business!

768
00:42:39,948 --> 00:42:42,603
Ever since then, you haven't been
the Bob Evans I know.

769
00:42:42,647 --> 00:42:44,581
Because the Bob Evans I know
wouldn't let his personal life

770
00:42:44,605 --> 00:42:46,104
- compromise this fucking movie.
- You don't know me.

771
00:42:46,128 --> 00:42:47,608
You don't know me!

772
00:42:47,652 --> 00:42:49,175
I know you're drinking too much

773
00:42:49,218 --> 00:42:50,568
- and doing blow.
- What the fuck?

774
00:42:50,611 --> 00:42:51,936
And I'm not the only person to notice.

775
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,483
What are you, my... my mother now?

776
00:42:53,527 --> 00:42:55,137
Jesus.

777
00:42:55,181 --> 00:42:57,618
Easy, Bob. People are looking at you.

778
00:42:57,662 --> 00:42:59,228
Let 'em!

779
00:42:59,272 --> 00:43:00,578
Let 'em fucking look!

780
00:43:01,865 --> 00:43:04,146
People watch me, bubbe,
always have, always will.

781
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:06,322
You know why?

782
00:43:06,366 --> 00:43:08,237
'Cause I'm Bob Evans.
I'm the best there is!

783
00:43:08,281 --> 00:43:09,848
Yeah!

784
00:43:09,891 --> 00:43:12,546
So you can keep
your fucking stick of gum,

785
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,784
and your... Your shoulder to cry on,

786
00:43:13,808 --> 00:43:15,003
and your sympathy. I don't need it.

787
00:43:15,027 --> 00:43:16,439
I've forgotten more about making movies

788
00:43:16,463 --> 00:43:17,682
than you'll ever know.

789
00:43:17,725 --> 00:43:19,379
They're looking... They're looking

790
00:43:19,422 --> 00:43:22,208
because they know I know the secret.

791
00:43:22,251 --> 00:43:25,907
They look because I shine like gold.

792
00:43:27,156 --> 00:43:30,333
They're looking at you now
because you're a joke.

793
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:40,052
Fuck you.

794
00:44:02,074 --> 00:44:03,423
Oh, no.

795
00:44:03,466 --> 00:44:04,903
Holy shit.

796
00:44:04,946 --> 00:44:06,121
Get the fuck out of my way.

797
00:44:06,165 --> 00:44:08,428
Jesus fuck!

798
00:44:08,471 --> 00:44:09,995
Have a drink.

799
00:44:15,827 --> 00:44:18,786
Mr. Ivy League. Hello.

800
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:20,570
What are you drinking?

801
00:44:20,614 --> 00:44:23,269
Club soda. Oh.

802
00:44:23,312 --> 00:44:25,271
You realize this is a bar, right?

803
00:44:25,314 --> 00:44:27,577
It's not a business meeting.

804
00:44:27,621 --> 00:44:29,971
You can order a harder drink

805
00:44:30,015 --> 00:44:33,192
and try using words
with less than two syllables.

806
00:44:33,235 --> 00:44:35,020
- Mm?
- Bettye.

807
00:44:39,782 --> 00:44:40,870
Oh, shit.

808
00:44:40,895 --> 00:44:42,490
Hey, you got a light?

809
00:44:42,515 --> 00:44:43,550
I don't smoke.

810
00:44:43,593 --> 00:44:44,812
Of course you don't.

811
00:44:46,074 --> 00:44:47,772
What kind of name is that anyway, huh?

812
00:44:47,815 --> 00:44:49,382
- Lapenis?
- Oh, boy.

813
00:44:49,425 --> 00:44:51,558
Lapenis!

814
00:44:51,601 --> 00:44:53,603
- It's pronounced Lapidus.
- Lapenis.

815
00:44:53,647 --> 00:44:55,780
- And its roots are in Latin.
- Lapenis.

816
00:44:55,823 --> 00:44:57,651
It means stone.

817
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:59,522
You're stoned?

818
00:44:59,566 --> 00:45:03,178
No, Lapidus means stone, like a rock?

819
00:45:07,182 --> 00:45:10,142
Oh, I like Lapenis better for you.

820
00:45:10,185 --> 00:45:11,578
- Okay, let's go.
- It's better.

821
00:45:13,536 --> 00:45:15,625
I don't think she likes me very much.

822
00:45:15,669 --> 00:45:17,932
Nobody does. Cheers!

823
00:45:19,847 --> 00:45:24,330
Al, Al, Al.

824
00:45:24,373 --> 00:45:28,203
Hey. You look sad.

825
00:45:31,163 --> 00:45:33,687
I'm gonna give Gallo
the money for Sicily.

826
00:45:35,602 --> 00:45:37,343
No other option.

827
00:45:37,386 --> 00:45:39,780
You're doing the right thing.

828
00:45:39,824 --> 00:45:41,782
Am I?

829
00:45:41,826 --> 00:45:46,744
You're doing the right thing.

830
00:45:46,787 --> 00:45:49,137
Hey, do me a favor.

831
00:45:49,181 --> 00:45:51,357
Leave Lapidus alone.

832
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,446
I was just going to look
for the bathroom!

833
00:45:53,489 --> 00:45:55,056
I was gonna pee, if that's allowed.

834
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:58,756
- Bathroom's that way.
- Okay.

835
00:45:58,799 --> 00:46:00,801
Lapenis, come on. That was really good.

836
00:46:00,845 --> 00:46:02,237
- Very funny.
- Yeah.

837
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:08,341
You start drinking without me?

838
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:11,072
Caesar!

839
00:46:13,685 --> 00:46:16,340
You ain't gonna cry on me, are you?

840
00:46:16,861 --> 00:46:19,515
I am so sorry about your boss.

841
00:46:22,127 --> 00:46:25,565
It's... it's okay. Thank you.

842
00:46:25,608 --> 00:46:28,220
Thank you.

843
00:46:28,263 --> 00:46:32,528
Thank you for the beautiful watch.

844
00:46:32,572 --> 00:46:34,737
I really appreciate the gesture.

845
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,490
I just can't accept it.

846
00:46:38,839 --> 00:46:41,015
I know.

847
00:46:41,059 --> 00:46:42,669
Uh, you seen Ruddy?

848
00:46:42,712 --> 00:46:44,323
Yeah, he's by the bar.

849
00:46:44,366 --> 00:46:45,846
I gotta take care of something.

850
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:47,282
Me too.

851
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:54,202
Why the long face?

852
00:46:54,246 --> 00:46:57,684
I just got a lot on my mind.

853
00:46:57,727 --> 00:46:59,860
How's Joe doing? Anything new?

854
00:46:59,904 --> 00:47:01,354
No.

855
00:47:01,379 --> 00:47:03,729
But you can cross one thing
off your list.

856
00:47:06,998 --> 00:47:10,131
You don't have to worry
about that fucking psychopath anymore.

857
00:47:17,346 --> 00:47:19,532
Francis.

858
00:47:19,575 --> 00:47:21,316
Yeah?

859
00:47:22,927 --> 00:47:24,189
We are going to Sicily?

860
00:47:24,232 --> 00:47:25,668
We're going to Sicily.

861
00:47:25,712 --> 00:47:27,627
- We're going.
- You son of a bitch!

862
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:29,063
Are you kidding?

863
00:47:29,107 --> 00:47:30,673
I knew you could do it.

864
00:47:30,717 --> 00:47:33,372
Everybody. Everybody!

865
00:47:33,415 --> 00:47:35,896
Can I have your attention, please?

866
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,680
We're going to Sicily!

867
00:47:48,415 --> 00:47:52,415

868
00:49:05,193 --> 00:49:07,794
Bruno would like for you
to come see him tomorrow.

869
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:08,822
Capisce?

870
00:49:08,847 --> 00:49:11,841
- Is Bruno mafia? All right.
- Si. They run everything here.

871
00:49:12,846 --> 00:49:15,153
We're all really looking forward
to the premiere.

872
00:49:15,178 --> 00:49:16,185
God damn it!

873
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:17,647
You know you can't invite
those guys, right?

874
00:49:17,671 --> 00:49:19,419
Do whatever it takes to get it done.

875
00:49:19,444 --> 00:49:20,845
Lapidus wants to see you.

876
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:22,974
- Where?
- In Evans' office.

877
00:49:23,013 --> 00:49:24,653
I'm not sure about the cat.

878
00:49:24,752 --> 00:49:26,318
Really? The cat's the problem?

879
00:49:26,343 --> 00:49:29,364
You make the movie and let
the adults figure out the poster.

880
00:49:29,389 --> 00:49:30,434
Where the hell is Evans?

881
00:49:30,459 --> 00:49:33,684
We need Bob to finish this movie
the right way.

882
00:49:33,709 --> 00:49:36,669
I cannot have a
drug addict running my company.

883
00:49:36,712 --> 00:49:38,018
I have responsibilities.

884
00:49:38,062 --> 00:49:39,324
Bettye I need your help.

885
00:49:39,367 --> 00:49:40,890
Could I get fired for it?

886
00:49:40,934 --> 00:49:42,892
We both could, but...

887
00:49:43,297 --> 00:49:44,661
it's worth it.
