00:56:20,812 --> 00:56:22,683
He wrote the script
for "Patton"

1228
00:56:22,814 --> 00:56:24,555
and probably gonna be nominated
for an Oscar.

1229
00:56:24,685 --> 00:56:27,514
Now, he might do this,
but he'll want to direct.

1230
00:56:27,645 --> 00:56:30,430
Evans will need
to be talked into it.

1231
00:56:30,561 --> 00:56:32,389
It's worth taking a shot.
It's a great idea.

1232
00:56:33,215 --> 00:56:35,043
Coppola owes Warners money,

1233
00:56:35,174 --> 00:56:37,524
and he has a very expensive
setup in San Francisco.

1234
00:56:37,655 --> 00:56:39,178
How do you know that?

1235
00:56:39,308 --> 00:56:41,180
A girl never
reveals her secrets.

1236
00:56:43,138 --> 00:56:44,531
You should give him a call.

1237
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:48,143
No.
Send Coppola the book.

1238
00:56:48,274 --> 00:56:49,754
Tell him I'm on the way.
Done.

1239
00:56:51,538 --> 00:56:53,758
Did you tell him
to come to me?

1240
00:56:56,761 --> 00:56:59,285
It was a good idea.
Yeah, I got a lot of those.

1241
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:02,201
[upbeat music]

1242
00:57:02,331 --> 00:57:03,289
How embarrassing for you.

1243
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,596
I--I left you
a message not to come.

1244
00:57:05,726 --> 00:57:08,468
Uh, I'm passing
on "The Godfather."

1245
00:57:09,251 --> 00:57:10,731
I got the message,

1246
00:57:10,862 --> 00:57:12,472
but I respect you
and what you stand for,

1247
00:57:12,603 --> 00:57:14,474
so I came to hear
the reason why.

1248
00:57:14,605 --> 00:57:16,781
Ah, okay, uh, as an Italian,

1249
00:57:16,911 --> 00:57:19,566
I don't want to
glorify mafia violence.

1250
00:57:20,611 --> 00:57:22,177
I agree with you.
You're right.

1251
00:57:22,308 --> 00:57:25,267
I mean, how do you glorify men
who cut the head off a horse

1252
00:57:25,398 --> 00:57:26,704
and put it in a producer's bed?

1253
00:57:26,834 --> 00:57:28,836
FRANCIS: [chuckles]
Yes, that producer...

1254
00:57:28,967 --> 00:57:29,968
AL: Deserved it.

1255
00:57:30,098 --> 00:57:32,492
Yes, he did.
It was a hell of a scene.

1256
00:57:33,798 --> 00:57:36,017
And Sonny gunned down
at a toll booth.

1257
00:57:36,888 --> 00:57:39,456
Or Michael seeing
his wife's car bombed in Sicily

1258
00:57:39,586 --> 00:57:41,849
after the wedding,
I mean, priceless.

1259
00:57:44,765 --> 00:57:46,985
Francis, let me be candid.

1260
00:57:47,115 --> 00:57:48,987
You're in director jail.

1261
00:57:49,117 --> 00:57:50,858
And the only movie I produced,
like your last movie,

1262
00:57:50,989 --> 00:57:53,165
didn't exactly
set the world on fire.

1263
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:56,734
And in spite of that,
here I am,

1264
00:57:56,864 --> 00:57:58,649
producer of the hottest novel
in the world,

1265
00:57:58,779 --> 00:58:01,042
and I'm begging you
to take it on.

1266
00:58:01,782 --> 00:58:03,305
You're a true artist.

1267
00:58:03,436 --> 00:58:05,177
We need that.

1268
00:58:09,442 --> 00:58:11,270
You help Mario Puzo
finish this script,

1269
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:12,880
we'll get you back
on the floor.

1270
00:58:14,229 --> 00:58:15,709
Are you telling me
that Bob Evans

1271
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,755
is gonna let me
direct this film?

1272
00:58:19,931 --> 00:58:22,324
It's not up to Bob.
It's up to you.

1273
00:58:23,238 --> 00:58:26,503
Francis Ford Coppola will
help Puzo finish the script.

1274
00:58:26,633 --> 00:58:28,766
Well, he's a great writer, man.
Smart move.

1275
00:58:28,896 --> 00:58:31,595
He didn't, um, hustle you
to let him direct?

1276
00:58:31,725 --> 00:58:33,597
No, I hustled him.

1277
00:58:33,727 --> 00:58:35,512
Look, we need
an Italian to do this.

1278
00:58:35,642 --> 00:58:36,774
He's got a great vision,

1279
00:58:36,904 --> 00:58:39,167
but, uh, he could
tell you about it himself.

1280
00:58:39,298 --> 00:58:40,604
Francis.

1281
00:58:43,171 --> 00:58:44,608
Hello, Bob.

1282
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:47,045
Hey, Francis.

1283
00:58:47,175 --> 00:58:48,829
How you been?

1284
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,483
He wanted to tell you
a little bit about

1285
00:58:50,614 --> 00:58:51,832
what he's got in mind
for "The Godfather."

1286
00:58:51,963 --> 00:58:54,356
Oh, I'm listening.
I'm all ears.

1287
00:58:54,487 --> 00:58:55,967
FRANCIS: Okay.

1288
00:58:57,403 --> 00:58:58,926
So why is it
that "The Godfather"

1289
00:58:59,057 --> 00:59:01,059
is selling more copies
than the Bible?

1290
00:59:02,364 --> 00:59:03,844
You think it's about
the drug trade

1291
00:59:03,975 --> 00:59:07,456
in 1946 New York City?
Not at all.

1292
00:59:07,587 --> 00:59:11,112
It's a metaphor
for American capitalism.

1293
00:59:12,026 --> 00:59:13,637
The American dream.

1294
00:59:13,767 --> 00:59:16,117
The mythic battle
for control, okay?

1295
00:59:16,248 --> 00:59:18,032
What is our opening line?

1296
00:59:18,163 --> 00:59:20,165
"I believe in America."

1297
00:59:21,383 --> 00:59:22,907
How perfect is that?

1298
00:59:23,037 --> 00:59:26,606
And what is America
to this undertaker?

1299
00:59:26,737 --> 00:59:29,566
It's a land of opportunity,

1300
00:59:29,696 --> 00:59:32,612
and it's a justice system
that has failed him.

1301
00:59:33,787 --> 00:59:36,137
It's Shakespeare.
It's Greek.

1302
00:59:37,443 --> 00:59:39,750
Biblical. Epic.

1303
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:41,447
Evil versus evil.

1304
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:42,970
Fun.

1305
00:59:43,101 --> 00:59:47,105
"The Godfather"
is a story about men,

1306
00:59:47,235 --> 00:59:49,716
and they come together,
and they form a bond,

1307
00:59:49,847 --> 00:59:54,112
and they find justice
through loyalty,

1308
00:59:54,242 --> 00:59:56,505
not the fucking law.

1309
00:59:56,636 --> 00:59:59,247
But at its core,

1310
00:59:59,378 --> 01:00:01,772
this is a story about family.

1311
01:00:01,902 --> 01:00:02,990
That's the secret sauce.

1312
01:00:03,121 --> 01:00:05,776
That is what has captured
the hearts

1313
01:00:05,906 --> 01:00:07,865
and minds of the whole world.

1314
01:00:07,995 --> 01:00:11,651
You read it and you say,
"That's my family."

1315
01:00:11,782 --> 01:00:14,001
That's your family.

1316
01:00:14,132 --> 01:00:17,657
For Paramount,
it's the Corleone family.

1317
01:00:17,788 --> 01:00:19,833
I know how to make this film.

1318
01:00:19,964 --> 01:00:21,792
You need an Italian
to tell this tale.

1319
01:00:21,922 --> 01:00:23,141
Four million all-in

1320
01:00:23,271 --> 01:00:25,622
not including prints and ads,
I can do that.

1321
01:00:25,752 --> 01:00:27,667
And, uh, he told me
to say that last part.

1322
01:00:27,798 --> 01:00:28,929
[chuckles]

1323
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:31,758
[chuckles]
So that's it.

1324
01:00:31,889 --> 01:00:33,194
That's my pitch.

1325
01:00:33,891 --> 01:00:35,719
That's great, Francis.

1326
01:00:35,849 --> 01:00:37,938
That is great stuff.

1327
01:00:38,896 --> 01:00:40,898
Cheers.
BOB: Cheers.

1328
01:00:41,028 --> 01:00:42,856
FRANCIS: I'm going to leave
you gentlemen to it.

1329
01:00:42,987 --> 01:00:45,859
I'm sure that
we will be talking soon.

1330
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:48,427
Thanks, buddy.
Good stuff.

1331
01:00:48,557 --> 01:00:51,560
Nice fucking ambush.

1332
01:00:51,691 --> 01:00:53,867
Jesus, taking a leaf out
of my playbook.

1333
01:00:53,998 --> 01:00:56,348
You don't like the rules much,
do you, Ruddy?

1334
01:00:56,478 --> 01:00:57,305
I don't know the rules.

1335
01:00:57,436 --> 01:00:58,916
[chuckles]

1336
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:02,920
Well, I guess it looks like
you got yourself a director.

1337
01:01:03,050 --> 01:01:04,661
Nice work, kiddo.

1338
01:01:04,791 --> 01:01:06,924
Nice work.

1339
01:01:08,795 --> 01:01:11,276
Tell me, how are
Nate's figures wrong again?

1340
01:01:11,406 --> 01:01:13,626
That's two weeks in a row.
Send someone to see...

1341
01:01:13,757 --> 01:01:14,758
All right, listen up.

1342
01:01:17,891 --> 01:01:21,460
The fucking book
is still number one,

1343
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:23,549
and now they're making
a movie of it.

1344
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,290
Well, I ain't gonna
see it, boss.

1345
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:27,379
The Jews got the JDL.

1346
01:01:27,509 --> 01:01:29,642
The Blacks got the NAACP.

1347
01:01:29,773 --> 01:01:31,339
But who defends us,
the Italians?

1348
01:01:31,470 --> 01:01:32,558
Nobody.
Nobody.

1349
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:33,820
Well, I'm starting.

1350
01:01:34,734 --> 01:01:36,867
Beginning now,

1351
01:01:36,997 --> 01:01:39,347
the Italian-American
Civil Rights League.

1352
01:01:40,871 --> 01:01:44,048
No gagootz is gonna
push us around anymore.

1353
01:01:45,658 --> 01:01:47,442
What the fuck
are those flowers?

1354
01:01:47,573 --> 01:01:49,314
It's from Sinatra.

1355
01:01:50,271 --> 01:01:53,448
It's says, "Hopefully, we can
make this thing go away."

1356
01:01:53,579 --> 01:01:54,711
It's a funeral wreath.

1357
01:01:54,841 --> 01:01:56,234
The florist fucked up.

1358
01:01:57,365 --> 01:01:59,150
No, he didn't fuck up.

1359
01:02:01,021 --> 01:02:03,415
Sinatra wants us
to shut the picture down.

1360
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:10,074
Get me Mickey Cohen
in Los Angeles.

1361
01:02:11,815 --> 01:02:13,294
It's time to send a message.

1362
01:02:15,209 --> 01:02:17,864
It smells delicious, guys.
Yeah.

1363
01:02:17,995 --> 01:02:19,344
It's a beautiful
piece of meat, huh?

1364
01:02:19,474 --> 01:02:20,562
Mmm.

1365
01:02:21,868 --> 01:02:23,870
Where you going
with that knife?

1366
01:02:24,001 --> 01:02:27,526
I'm going to cut the fat
so that I can brown it.

1367
01:02:27,656 --> 01:02:28,745
Brown it?

1368
01:02:28,875 --> 01:02:30,790
My mother
never browned anything.

1369
01:02:30,921 --> 01:02:32,574
She fried it.

1370
01:02:32,705 --> 01:02:33,532
What's the difference?

1371
01:02:36,404 --> 01:02:38,929
We have
to put this in the picture.

1372
01:02:39,059 --> 01:02:41,758
AL: What? A scene about
gangsters arguing over sauce?

1373
01:02:41,888 --> 01:02:46,284
No, a scene about family
arguing over sauce.

1374
01:02:46,414 --> 01:02:49,113
Huh?
Huh?

You've read The Godfather right?

1411
01:04:42,748 --> 01:04:45,011
I knew only one thing about
the making of The Godfather,

1412
01:04:45,142 --> 01:04:47,579
which was that Mario Puzo got
into a fight

1413
01:04:47,709 --> 01:04:49,015
with Frank Sinatra in Chasen's.

1414
01:04:49,146 --> 01:04:50,538
You know me?
FRANK: Yeah, I know who you are.

1415
01:04:50,669 --> 01:04:52,366
Hey, hey, hey.
MICHAEL: So I had five minutes,

1416
01:04:52,497 --> 01:04:55,326
and I only had to fill in 9
hours and 55 minutes more,

1417
01:04:55,674 --> 01:04:56,893
and we'd have a show.

1418
01:05:01,506 --> 01:05:03,247
ROBERT: The Godfather.
Sure. Who hasn't?

1419
01:05:03,377 --> 01:05:04,291
I mean, you've read it.

1420
01:05:04,422 --> 01:05:05,423
It's, it's great. I love it.

1421
01:05:06,598 --> 01:05:07,816
The Godfather has always sort of
just been

1422
01:05:07,947 --> 01:05:09,209
the North Star for me.

1423
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:10,994
RUSSEL: We approach the movie
with reverence,

1424
01:05:11,124 --> 01:05:13,257
because it is definitely
one of the greatest movies

1425
01:05:13,387 --> 01:05:14,084
of all time.

1426
01:05:15,433 --> 01:05:15,694
When we first were in the
writers' room, we said,

1427
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,697
"Okay, character arcs.
What is this really about?

1428
01:05:18,827 --> 01:05:20,960
What story are we telling?
How do you tell 10 episodes

1429
01:05:21,091 --> 01:05:22,744
about the making
of The Godfather?"

1430
01:05:22,875 --> 01:05:23,702
So our take on it

1431
01:05:25,095 --> 01:05:27,619
was always to respect
the masterpiece that this is,

1432
01:05:27,749 --> 01:05:29,969
because the story's really
about what's behind the scenes.

1433
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:32,189
It's really about how difficult
it was

1434
01:05:32,319 --> 01:05:33,494
to get this movie made.

1435
01:05:33,625 --> 01:05:34,626
From early on,

1436
01:05:35,975 --> 01:05:39,239
we talked about the fact
that The Offer explored

1437
01:05:39,370 --> 01:05:41,894
like three disparate worlds.

1438
01:05:42,025 --> 01:05:43,983
Basically there are three
families in the movie.

1439
01:05:44,114 --> 01:05:45,811
Coppola and the family
of the filmmakers.

1440
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:47,030
Robert Evans and the family

1441
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:49,771
of Gulf and Western,
the executives.

1442
01:05:49,902 --> 01:05:52,861
And Joe Colombo
and the family of the mafia.

1443
01:05:52,992 --> 01:05:54,211
ALL: Salute!

1444
01:05:55,734 --> 01:05:58,693
And bouncing between those
three families is Al Ruddy.

1445
01:05:58,824 --> 01:06:01,870
RUSSEL: The story of Al Ruddy
trying to get this movie made,

1446
01:06:02,001 --> 01:06:03,133
and what he and Coppola,

1447
01:06:03,263 --> 01:06:05,439
and everybody went through
to get it made

1448
01:06:05,787 --> 01:06:06,875
is just astounding.

1449
01:06:07,006 --> 01:06:08,312
One of the joys
of the script is,

1450
01:06:08,442 --> 01:06:10,314
is that there's so much tension.

1451
01:06:10,444 --> 01:06:12,185
We know it was made,
and yet when you're doing it,

1452
01:06:12,316 --> 01:06:15,014
you're like, it seems like it
could fall down at any minute.

1453
01:06:15,145 --> 01:06:15,972
We've been all over town,

1454
01:06:17,277 --> 01:06:17,756
no one wants to make this
movie for $4 million.

1455
01:06:18,626 --> 01:06:19,845
So I need you to produce it.

1456
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:22,021
Not only was he a producer

1457
01:06:22,152 --> 01:06:24,937
that was having to
battle the studio system,

1458
01:06:25,068 --> 01:06:28,201
but he was also battling
the real life mafia.

1459
01:06:28,332 --> 01:06:30,073
For every character
in the story,

1460
01:06:30,203 --> 01:06:31,422
getting this movie made

1461
01:06:31,552 --> 01:06:33,076
or stopping this movie
from being made,

1462
01:06:33,206 --> 01:06:35,252
was a matter of life and death,
literally.

1463
01:06:35,382 --> 01:06:36,427
[GUNSHOT]
[GLASS SHATTERS]

1464
01:06:37,863 --> 01:06:39,778
What I really enjoy about
this character, and with Al,

1465
01:06:40,083 --> 01:06:41,780
is that he's such a man
of action.

1466
01:06:42,085 --> 01:06:44,087
These were some
really serious situations

1467
01:06:44,217 --> 01:06:45,523
that Al was in. Very dangerous.

1468
01:06:45,653 --> 01:06:47,568
You don't like the rules much,
do you Ruddy?

1469
01:06:47,699 --> 01:06:48,308
I don't know the rules.

1470
01:06:49,788 --> 01:06:51,964
You borderline have to be
kind of insane to do the stuff

1471
01:06:52,095 --> 01:06:54,314
that he did
to get this movie made,

1472
01:06:54,445 --> 01:06:58,014
because he really did feel
with every fiber of his being

1473
01:06:58,449 --> 01:07:00,016
that this script was worth it,

1474
01:07:00,146 --> 01:07:01,321
that these actors were worth it,

1475
01:07:01,452 --> 01:07:03,671
that it was all worth it.

1476
01:07:03,802 --> 01:07:07,023
Nice work kiddo, nice work.

1477
01:07:07,545 --> 01:07:09,764
We like to pay homage to
the movie whenever we can,

1478
01:07:10,113 --> 01:07:12,158
and we do it in certain
episodes.

1479
01:07:12,724 --> 01:07:13,681
Hello, Bob.

1480
01:07:15,335 --> 01:07:16,684
There's a specific scene where
that really came home for me.

1481
01:07:16,815 --> 01:07:18,686
Hey, hey, Francis. How you been?

1482
01:07:18,817 --> 01:07:23,604
He is pitching to Ruddy
and Evans in the bar,

1483
01:07:23,735 --> 01:07:24,344
and he says...

1484
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:28,131
FRANCIS: The Godfather
is a story about men.

1485
01:07:28,261 --> 01:07:32,222
Men, brothers, businessmen,
who come together...

1486
01:07:32,352 --> 01:07:35,138
...And they form a bond
and they find justice

1487
01:07:35,964 --> 01:07:37,227
through loyalty.

1488
01:07:38,750 --> 01:07:40,708
And I thought, "Oh, shit! That's
exactly what we're doing."

1489
01:07:40,969 --> 01:07:42,014
It's a metaphor.

1490
01:07:42,145 --> 01:07:43,711
RUSSEL: You have
these three brothers

1491
01:07:43,842 --> 01:07:45,104
coming from different places

1492
01:07:45,235 --> 01:07:47,237
coming together to try to get
this made,

1493
01:07:47,367 --> 01:07:49,065
arguing like a family,

1494
01:07:49,195 --> 01:07:50,936
like the three brothers
might be arguing

1495
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:52,242
in the Corleone family.

1496
01:07:53,678 --> 01:07:54,461
To us, it was important to
follow each of their arcs

1497
01:07:55,506 --> 01:07:56,333
and have each of them
have conflict.

1498
01:07:57,551 --> 01:07:59,814
You read it and you
say, "That's my family."

1499
01:08:00,119 --> 01:08:01,033
They fight.

1500
01:08:01,164 --> 01:08:02,165
They yell at each other.

1501
01:08:02,295 --> 01:08:03,470
They don't like each other
sometimes,

1502
01:08:03,601 --> 01:08:05,081
but at the end, they
come back for each other.

1503
01:08:05,211 --> 01:08:07,213
That is great stuff.
