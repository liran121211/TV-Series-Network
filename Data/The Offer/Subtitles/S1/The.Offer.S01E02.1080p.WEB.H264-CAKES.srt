00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,560
that, uh,
the whole look of the film

356
00:17:19,603 --> 00:17:21,605
should reflect this opposition
of the light and the dark.

357
00:17:21,649 --> 00:17:23,433
Make it feel real.

358
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:25,218
None of these caricatures
of what a gangster is.

359
00:17:25,261 --> 00:17:26,697
Yeah, they're family men,

360
00:17:26,741 --> 00:17:28,090
they're--they're--
they're businessmen, you know,

361
00:17:28,134 --> 00:17:29,483
they could be your neighbor.

362
00:17:29,526 --> 00:17:31,224
I'm pretty sure
one of them is.

363
00:17:31,267 --> 00:17:32,660
[laughter]
[door opens]

364
00:17:33,965 --> 00:17:35,619
BOB: Hey, Barry.

365
00:17:35,663 --> 00:17:37,360
I'm sorry, I thought you were
on the way to the airport.

366
00:17:37,404 --> 00:17:38,622
Do you need something?

367
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,015
Oh, no, thanks, Bob.

368
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,799
Appreciate you asking though.

369
00:17:41,843 --> 00:17:44,106
Everyone,
this is Barry Lapidus,

370
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,065
Gulf and Western's
shining star,

371
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:48,328
and Jack Ballard,
who runs physical production.

372
00:17:48,371 --> 00:17:49,981
Hey, Jack.

373
00:17:50,025 --> 00:17:52,462
Look, uh,
I'm a little tied up right now.

374
00:17:52,506 --> 00:17:54,290
Can I come and see you after?

375
00:17:54,334 --> 00:17:55,726
BARRY: Oh, no.
That won't be necessary.

376
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:58,077
This meeting is the reason
why I'm here.

377
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,209
Look, I know that
the last thing we all want

378
00:18:00,253 --> 00:18:02,211
is this production
to go off the rails

379
00:18:02,255 --> 00:18:04,387
and become another disaster
like "Waterloo,"

380
00:18:04,431 --> 00:18:07,129
so I've come to present you
with a reality check.

381
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:09,262
My team has done
some financials.

382
00:18:09,305 --> 00:18:11,699
First off, shooting in New York
is way too expensive.

383
00:18:11,742 --> 00:18:14,658
Excuse me.
You can't shoot LA

384
00:18:14,702 --> 00:18:17,096
for New York.
JACK: No. No.

385
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:18,619
Of course not.

386
00:18:18,662 --> 00:18:22,057
Uh, Kansas City or St. Louis
could help bring costs down,

387
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,277
especially if we don't shoot
this period.

388
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,626
Hold on.

389
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:28,542
This entire story,
it takes place

390
00:18:28,585 --> 00:18:31,719
in a very specific time
during post-war America.

391
00:18:31,762 --> 00:18:33,373
It doesn't make sense
any other way.

392
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,244
So Michael comes home
from Vietnam

393
00:18:35,288 --> 00:18:36,898
instead of World War II.

394
00:18:36,941 --> 00:18:38,682
That makes it
even more relevant.

395
00:18:38,726 --> 00:18:40,249
Keep it contemporary.

396
00:18:40,293 --> 00:18:44,079
It's not like crime
no longer exists, right?

397
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,037
Look, this is how
it's going to be

398
00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:47,604
if you want to make this movie.

399
00:18:47,648 --> 00:18:49,084
Wow.

400
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,652
It's very, very
interesting, Barry.

401
00:18:51,695 --> 00:18:52,827
Thank you very much
for bringing

402
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:54,437
that imagination to the party.

403
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:57,397
You know what,
a lot of food for thought, huh?

404
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,963
A lot of food for thought.

405
00:18:59,007 --> 00:19:02,184
Yeah.
Well...think hard.

406
00:19:02,228 --> 00:19:04,143
BOB: Oh, yeah.

407
00:19:06,449 --> 00:19:08,147
What'd I tell you?

408
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,105
[whispers] Fuck.

409
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,715
BETTYE:
Francis, listen to me.

410
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:14,631
Hey, where you going?
Hey, nice to see you.

411
00:19:14,675 --> 00:19:17,547
What the fuck just happened?
Lapidus.

412
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:22,335
♪

413
00:19:22,378 --> 00:19:23,684
Hey, Francis.

414
00:19:23,727 --> 00:19:25,294
Where were you?

415
00:19:25,338 --> 00:19:26,904
I was handling something
important for us.

416
00:19:26,948 --> 00:19:28,776
Trust me.
Oh, okay.

417
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:30,125
Well, was it more important

418
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,519
than setting this
in modern times?

419
00:19:32,562 --> 00:19:33,781
Was it more important
than shooting

420
00:19:33,824 --> 00:19:35,870
"The Godfather" in St. Louis?

421
00:19:35,913 --> 00:19:37,350
What?
Evans said that?

422
00:19:37,393 --> 00:19:39,656
No, he didn't say anything.
He just sat there!

423
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,268
You know what?
You said--

424
00:19:42,311 --> 00:19:44,444
you said that he was
gonna be a standup guy.

425
00:19:44,487 --> 00:19:46,837
You said that he was gonna
support my vision,

426
00:19:46,881 --> 00:19:49,057
and that empty suit
folded like origami.

427
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,015
Listen to me, I'm gonna
take care of it, okay?

428
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:52,495
But the best thing
you can do to help

429
00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:54,323
is just to write
an undeniable script.

430
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:56,020
You're lucky
that I need this paycheck

431
00:19:56,064 --> 00:19:57,239
to keep my business afloat,

432
00:19:57,283 --> 00:19:58,284
otherwise you'd be seeing
my taillights

433
00:19:58,327 --> 00:19:59,763
for the last time.

434
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,942
AL: So now,
Barry Lapidus is dictating

435
00:20:04,986 --> 00:20:06,205
what "The Godfather"
is gonna be?

436
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:08,903
Ruddy, Ruddy.
Stop being so emotional.

437
00:20:08,946 --> 00:20:11,949
Of course
I support Francis' vision.

438
00:20:11,993 --> 00:20:13,821
But, you know,
you gotta read the room, kid.

439
00:20:13,864 --> 00:20:14,909
And nothing good
would've come from

440
00:20:14,952 --> 00:20:16,476
me confronting Barry
right then.

441
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:17,912
Fucking Barry.

442
00:20:17,955 --> 00:20:20,784
Barry is mad at the world

443
00:20:20,828 --> 00:20:22,569
because it sees him
for what he truly is:

444
00:20:22,612 --> 00:20:24,440
a no-talent prick.

445
00:20:24,484 --> 00:20:27,965
But he feels like he got a win,

446
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:29,793
like he's the big man
on campus.

447
00:20:29,837 --> 00:20:32,231
Let him think that for now.
It keeps him out of our way.

448
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:33,797
I don't know how you're being
so relaxed about this.

449
00:20:33,841 --> 00:20:34,972
Francis, he's about to quit.

450
00:20:35,016 --> 00:20:36,278
Said every director

451
00:20:36,322 --> 00:20:37,453
who eventually finished
their picture.

452
00:20:37,497 --> 00:20:41,240
Trust me,
Francis isn't going anywhere.

453
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:43,285
So we don't have to set this
in present day?

454
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:44,591
Ruddy--
[sighs]

455
00:20:44,634 --> 00:20:46,332
How did you get into my office?
Hmm?

456
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,550
What do you mean?

457
00:20:47,594 --> 00:20:49,291
You got in

458
00:20:49,335 --> 00:20:51,032
because you did something
that's not done.

459
00:20:51,075 --> 00:20:51,989
You saw something
that you wanted

460
00:20:52,033 --> 00:20:54,383
and you went it for it.
Woof!

461
00:20:54,427 --> 00:20:57,081
You and I are not like
these corporate fucks.

462
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,996
We don't play by the book.
We write the fucking book.

463
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,303
Now, you want to be
a great producer?

464
00:21:01,347 --> 00:21:02,957
You do whatever it takes
to get your movie made

465
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,785
the way you want to do it.
Now, you want New York?

466
00:21:04,828 --> 00:21:07,440
Go there, make some deals,

467
00:21:07,483 --> 00:21:08,789
prove that you can do it
for the money.

468
00:21:08,832 --> 00:21:10,704
Beg, borrow--
I don't give a fuck.

469
00:21:10,747 --> 00:21:12,314
Steal.
You do whatever it takes.

470
00:21:12,358 --> 00:21:14,708
Now...

471
00:21:14,751 --> 00:21:16,623
you don't have
a long track record,

472
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:21,584
but you got brains,
and you got balls.

473
00:21:21,628 --> 00:21:23,369
Try using both.

474
00:21:23,412 --> 00:21:26,241
Preferably at the same time.

475
00:21:36,425 --> 00:21:38,079
On behalf of the Mangia
America Food Company,

476
00:21:38,122 --> 00:21:39,428
please allow us

477
00:21:39,472 --> 00:21:41,343
to lend the financial support
you requested.

478
00:21:41,387 --> 00:21:42,866
The League,
it's very important to us.

479
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,695
$10,000.
What is that? An insult?

480
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:47,175
No, sir, it's--

481
00:21:47,218 --> 00:21:48,219
it's just the beginning
of what we're prepared--

482
00:21:48,263 --> 00:21:49,525
Here's the beginning.

483
00:21:49,569 --> 00:21:50,613
Put another zero
on the end there

484
00:21:50,657 --> 00:21:52,180
and then we're straight.

485
00:21:52,223 --> 00:21:55,314
You want a $100,000?

486
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:57,577
You don't think I know
how much fucking money

487
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,883
you make a year,
you greedy fuck?

488
00:21:59,927 --> 00:22:02,625
You're--you're lucky, I ain't
making you kick in personally.

489
00:22:02,669 --> 00:22:05,324
Now, be a good boy
and add the zero.

490
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:06,586
I'll take this fucking pen

491
00:22:06,629 --> 00:22:08,675
and I'll stab you
in the fucking throat.

492
00:22:08,718 --> 00:22:10,111
Add the fucking zero.

493
00:22:11,112 --> 00:22:13,027
Go over to the bar.

494
00:22:14,768 --> 00:22:16,160
David.
[chuckles]

495
00:22:16,204 --> 00:22:17,858
I hope you're bringing me
something better.

496
00:22:17,901 --> 00:22:19,860
Not like this fucking meatball.

497
00:22:19,903 --> 00:22:21,775
Danny Thomas?

498
00:22:21,818 --> 00:22:23,342
He's not anybody's
first choice

499
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:24,604
but he likes the book.

500
00:22:24,647 --> 00:22:26,475
He's a comedy actor
and he's Lebanese.

501
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:27,824
Quinn is a great actor.

502
00:22:27,868 --> 00:22:29,391
He's half Mexican.

503
00:22:29,435 --> 00:22:31,088
He's played Arabian, Greek...

504
00:22:31,132 --> 00:22:33,047
Olivier is being treated
for prostate cancer.

505
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,265
How do you know that?

506
00:22:34,309 --> 00:22:36,877
Okay, they're all
wonderful actors

507
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,096
but the Don is so specific.

508
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,750
He's explosive,

509
00:22:40,794 --> 00:22:43,449
and he's charismatic,
and he's warm.

510
00:22:43,492 --> 00:22:44,885
And I really think
that we should be talking

511
00:22:44,928 --> 00:22:47,017
about Brando for this.

512
00:22:47,061 --> 00:22:48,323
World's greatest actor.

513
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:49,933
That's not happening
AL: Why not?

514
00:22:49,977 --> 00:22:51,761
Because we have no budget,

515
00:22:51,805 --> 00:22:53,589
and so why the hell
are we even doing this?

516
00:22:53,633 --> 00:22:55,896
In my experience,
if you get them excited

517
00:22:55,939 --> 00:22:57,506
about who you want,

518
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,073
they'll find breakage.

519
00:22:59,116 --> 00:23:00,901
What's breakage?
It's more money.

520
00:23:00,944 --> 00:23:02,381
But not for Brando.

521
00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:04,774
Jesus Christ, Andrea.

522
00:23:04,818 --> 00:23:06,428
The director, the writer,
and the producer

523
00:23:06,472 --> 00:23:07,603
are all on board
with this thing.

524
00:23:07,647 --> 00:23:09,344
So why not give it
a fucking try?

525
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,390
Brando's an amazing actor,

526
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:13,740
but he's notoriously difficult,
very expensive,

527
00:23:13,783 --> 00:23:15,306
and his last
four movies bombed.

528
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,612
So there's no way in hell

529
00:23:16,656 --> 00:23:17,961
you're gonna get Bob Evans

00:56:56,108 --> 00:56:59,590
So how'd you start working
with Ruddy?

1234
00:56:59,633 --> 00:57:01,940
I've never seen an assistant
this involved in the process.

1235
00:57:01,983 --> 00:57:04,246
We're both kind of like,
"Did you?"

1236
00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:05,857
I didn't fuck him,
if that's what you're asking.

1237
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:08,599
They were two women that
are navigating the world

1238
00:57:08,642 --> 00:57:10,557
in a very, very different way,

1239
00:57:10,601 --> 00:57:13,430
but are still fierce
in their own right,

1240
00:57:13,952 --> 00:57:17,216
not just because they were
women doing these jobs,

1241
00:57:17,259 --> 00:57:20,306
but because they were
incredible people
doing these jobs.

1242
00:57:20,349 --> 00:57:21,916
BETTYE: How did you
become head of casting?

1243
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:24,876
I like to think it's 'cause
I have a real eye for talent,

1244
00:57:25,703 --> 00:57:27,748
but it might've been the skirt.
I don't know.

1245
00:57:27,792 --> 00:57:29,184
STEPHANIE: That scene,

1246
00:57:29,228 --> 00:57:31,448
I think it was supposed
to be in a casting office,

1247
00:57:31,491 --> 00:57:34,363
and Dexter Fletcher was
like, "Oh no, no, no, no.

1248
00:57:34,407 --> 00:57:35,974
We're gonna blow the scene out.

1249
00:57:36,017 --> 00:57:38,193
It's gonna be driving
through the Paramount lot.

1250
00:57:38,237 --> 00:57:41,458
There's gonna be welders,
there's gonna be gladiators."

1251
00:57:41,501 --> 00:57:44,373
JUNO: We got to zip around
the Paramount lot

1252
00:57:44,417 --> 00:57:45,810
on a Sunday when it was empty.

1253
00:57:45,853 --> 00:57:49,553
So you fully were transported
into their universe.

1254
00:57:49,596 --> 00:57:50,989
It was a pinch-me moment.

1255
00:57:51,032 --> 00:57:53,687
I just-- It makes all my hair
stand up, you know?

1256
00:57:53,731 --> 00:57:55,472
[TYPEWRITER CLICKING]

1257
00:57:55,515 --> 00:57:57,125
We had another scene
where Coppola

1258
00:57:57,169 --> 00:57:58,779
and Puzo were working
on the script.

1259
00:57:58,823 --> 00:58:00,302
PATRICK: They were artists,
at the end of the day.

1260
00:58:00,346 --> 00:58:04,089
They existed based on their
imagination.

1261
00:58:04,132 --> 00:58:06,047
Telling stories,
creating a world.

1262
00:58:06,657 --> 00:58:09,050
DAN: I'd just met Patrick
in rehearsal,

1263
00:58:09,094 --> 00:58:11,618
and he was like, "Yeah, I'm
looking for a place to live."

1264
00:58:11,662 --> 00:58:13,577
[LAUGHS] And I was like,

1265
00:58:13,925 --> 00:58:15,317
all right, I'll take a risk here

1266
00:58:15,361 --> 00:58:17,537
out of, you know,
the love of the game.

1267
00:58:17,581 --> 00:58:19,365
Let's get method here, man.

1268
00:58:19,408 --> 00:58:20,322
You never know.

1269
00:58:20,758 --> 00:58:21,628
Fingers crossed, right?

1270
00:58:23,108 --> 00:58:25,197
DAN: He was my roommate
for the first two

1271
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:26,459
or three weeks of shooting.

1272
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:28,243
It's not something
I will soon forget.

1273
00:58:28,287 --> 00:58:31,290
That connection when you
meet someone
who you connect with,

1274
00:58:31,333 --> 00:58:32,987
creatively and artistically,

1275
00:58:33,031 --> 00:58:36,164
it's a rare thing
and it's a really special thing.

1276
00:58:36,208 --> 00:58:37,470
Did you eat my ham?

1277
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:40,908
So I think that gave
such a wonderful rhythm

1278
00:58:40,952 --> 00:58:42,910
to their relationship
very quickly.

1279
00:58:43,389 --> 00:58:44,738
I'm loving you, Mario.

1280
00:58:45,217 --> 00:58:47,001
And I think it shows,
I think that on the screen,

1281
00:58:47,045 --> 00:58:49,221
you see that we genuinely
really get along.

1282
00:58:49,264 --> 00:58:50,178
Salute.

1283
00:58:51,658 --> 00:58:53,051
That was a big risk. He could
have been a real jerk...

1284
00:58:53,094 --> 00:58:54,443
[LAUGHS] ...you know,
but he was great, he was great.

1285
00:58:54,487 --> 00:58:55,793
PATRICK: How lucky are we
to have been able

1286
00:58:55,836 --> 00:58:57,490
to develop a relationship

1287
00:58:58,012 --> 00:59:00,101
that is gonna effortlessly
bring itself to set?

1288
00:59:00,449 --> 00:59:01,755
It's a beautiful gift.

1289
00:59:01,799 --> 00:59:03,235
Hey, I want in on this.
