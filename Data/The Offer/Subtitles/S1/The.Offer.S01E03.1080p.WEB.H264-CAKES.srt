Both Miles and Giovanni

brought incredible
weight to that scene.

I love Miles Teller.

1275
00:54:50,591 --> 00:54:54,421
It's like working with
a leading man out of the 1950s,

1276
00:54:54,726 --> 00:54:55,553
which for me

1277
00:54:56,249 --> 00:54:58,033
is probably the highest praise
I could give anybody.

1278
00:55:02,864 --> 00:55:05,345
This was the moment
in the series

1279
00:55:05,389 --> 00:55:08,348
where they first really
encounter one another,

1280
00:55:08,392 --> 00:55:10,655
and they were
very invested in it.

1281

When you have somebody
to parlay off of,

1282
00:55:12,831 --> 00:55:15,486
and you can see that they're
responding to certain things,

1283
00:55:15,529 --> 00:55:17,357
and they're making you respond,

1284
00:55:17,401 --> 00:55:19,577
this is what you strive for
as an actor.

Stop what you're doing,

00:55:24,538 --> 00:55:28,412
It was one of the more daunting
roles for me, personally,

1288
00:55:28,455 --> 00:55:29,543
in my career.

1289
00:55:29,804 --> 00:55:33,286
Joe Colombo just existed
in a different universe.

1290
00:55:33,634 --> 00:55:37,812
He brought a combination
of both humor

1291
00:55:37,856 --> 00:55:43,252
and bone-chilling fear into
his portrayal of Joe Colombo.

if you hear me out first.

ADAM: It's one
of the relationships

the furthest distance

1297
00:55:52,566 --> 00:55:54,568
over the course of the show
because they start out

1298
00:55:54,612 --> 00:55:58,093
in a threatening,
adversarial posture
with each other.

1299

00:56:02,141 --> 00:56:03,838
that my movie is not gonna be
the book.

What the fuck does that mean?

1303
00:56:07,712 --> 00:56:12,281
It was incredible to
watch Miles bring the fear

1304
00:56:12,325 --> 00:56:15,589
to what this character was
experiencing at that time.

1305
00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:18,331
He wanted to really tap into

1306
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:19,985
the nail biting aspect of that,

1307
00:56:20,028 --> 00:56:21,943

of it.

"Did this actually...?"

1313
00:56:31,257 --> 00:56:32,389
They're like, "Absolutely,"

1314
00:56:32,432 --> 00:56:34,521
and all these things
actually happened.

1315
00:56:34,565 --> 00:56:39,047
I said, "Joe, I am willing
to let you read the screenplay

1316
00:56:39,091 --> 00:56:41,049
which nobody has seen.

1317
00:56:41,485 --> 00:56:42,921

00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:48,535
He said, "I'll be there tomorrow
at 2:00."

1320
00:56:48,579 --> 00:56:51,408
When Ruddy invites Joe
to read the script,

1321
00:56:51,712 --> 00:56:54,236
you know what I mean,
that's insane to me.

Okay.

00:57:04,072 --> 00:57:05,160
MICHAEL: Colombo did come up
to his office,

1329
00:57:05,465 --> 00:57:06,684
Colombo picked up the script,

1330
00:57:06,727 --> 00:57:09,469
and first thing he said,
"What's this fade-in?"

1331
00:57:09,861 --> 00:57:10,905
The fade-in.

1332
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:12,690
What's that mean?

1333
00:57:13,212 --> 00:57:15,127
Joe, fade-in's a script term.

1334
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:16,520
Ruddy explained it.

1335
00:57:16,563 --> 00:57:17,651
That's Hollywood bullshit.

1336
00:57:18,043 --> 00:57:20,437
And then Colombo sort of
thumbed through the script

1337
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,396
and decided that Ruddy
was a stand up guy.

1338
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,745
I ain't here to waste your time.

1339
00:57:25,093 --> 00:57:27,400
You're a straight shooter

But we still got a problem.

1342
00:57:31,186 --> 00:57:34,451
AL: Finally, I said,
"Joe, what do you want?"

1343
00:57:34,755 --> 00:57:37,018
And he said, "I'll tell
you exactly what I want.

1344
00:57:37,062 --> 00:57:41,240
I want you to take the word
'mafia' out of the movie."

1345
00:57:41,719 --> 00:57:42,807

Congratulations.

1347
00:57:46,332 --> 00:57:49,422
I said, "Shake my hand, Joe,
and we have a deal."

1348
00:57:49,683 --> 00:57:53,034
There was a real creed with
the mafia and those guys

1349
00:57:53,078 --> 00:57:56,168
that you don't go back
on your word, you know?

1350
00:57:56,211 --> 00:57:58,605
And I think Al was very...

1351
00:57:58,649 --> 00:58:01,390
Um, if he said something,
he meant it, you know?

1352
00:58:01,913 --> 00:58:04,263
And I think that went
a long way with them.

have been very different,

1357
00:58:11,139 --> 00:58:14,447
but their intensity
and their resolve was...

1358
00:58:14,708 --> 00:58:16,275
You know, they were
sort of brothers in arms

1359
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:17,363
in that respect.

1360
00:58:17,406 --> 00:58:19,713
I see a job in front of me
and I do it.

1361
00:58:19,757 --> 00:58:20,932
It's the only way I know how.

00:58:20,975 --> 00:58:24,022
Whoa, do I understand that,
