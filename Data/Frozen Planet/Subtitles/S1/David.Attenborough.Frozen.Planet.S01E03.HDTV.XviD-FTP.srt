1
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,300
Summer in the polar regions,
and the sun never sets.

2
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,780
Imagine a single day
that lasts for months.

3
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,819
Some polar animals
will face great challenges

4
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,500
as their ice world
vanishes around them.

5
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,979
Others must use
this special time wisely,

6
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,780
for summer's riches will not last.

7
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,379
The summer is just beginning

8
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,539
and the increasing power of the sun

9
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,460
is creating
a spectacular new landscape.

10
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:52,139
This melting ice sheet
in the Arctic is 150 miles long,

11
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,820
with 1,000 waterfalls.

12
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,059
Vast expanses of ice

13
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:06,100
that were once stone still,
have come to life.

14
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,219
The polar bear's world
is melting away

15
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,900
under the constant summer sun.

16
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:50,220
As the season advances, the frozen
surface of the ocean disintegrates.

17
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,860
Soon, the ice here
will have totally vanished.

18
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,740
The polar bear family have to adapt
to their rapidly-changing home.

19
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:20,179
For the two cubs,
this is a whole new watery world.

20
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,500
It's the first time
they have seen the sea ice break up.

21
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,059
They're only six months old

22
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,860
and will be dependent on their
mother for another two years.

23
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,820
They have much to learn.

24
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,219
Their first swimming lesson,

25
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,340
and they're not sure
that they want it.

26
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:12,500
For their mother,
swimming is second nature.

27
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,139
But the cubs still prefer
to have ice beneath their feet

28
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,420
whenever they can.

29
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,980
Soon, it will be impossible
to avoid the water.

30
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,059
This lone male has lived through
a dozen summers

31
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,220
and is perfectly at home
in the sea.

32
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,420
He can swim up to 50 miles a day.

33
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:03,420
He's hungry, and he's searching
this ice maze for seals.

34
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,619
But travelling across
this increasingly fragile ice scape

35
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,220
is hard work for an animal
weighing over half a tonne.

36
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,380
It's also harder to hunt
when you have to swim.

37
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,460
In open water,
the odds are in the seals' favour.

38
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,259
Lean months lie ahead
for the polar bears.

39
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,779
They will have to adopt
new hunting strategies,

40
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,660
or risk starvation.

41
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,339
The northern part of the Earth
is now tilting towards the sun,

42
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:25,740
and all around the Arctic,
the sea ice continues its retreat.

43
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,779
The last remnants of the ice world

44
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,580
drift with the wind and the tides.

45
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:05,339
The sun's heat may be gentle
at these latitudes,

46
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,899
but it is continuous
for 24 hours a day,

47
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,340
and it carves the ice
into magical shapes.

48
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:33,620
Those that need ice have to visit
the glacier fronts to find it.

49
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,100
A comfortable bed
is hard to come by.

50
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,419
A polar bear's fur is so dense

51
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,060
that water is easily shaken off.

52
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,500
And ice absorbs water like a towel.

53
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,220
That's better.

54
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:35,259
There's now little chance
of catching seals,

55
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:39,220
and this bear may not eat again
until the end of summer.

56
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:46,780
It's better to save energy
and doze in the sun.

57
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,139
The warmth of the sun's rays

58
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,300
is now bringing the Arctic lands
back to life.

59
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,980
FAINT BIRDSONG

60
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,940
TWITTERING

61
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,620
BIRDSONG

62
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,379
Red phalaropes.

63
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:06,459
They've flown
all the way from the tropics

64
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:10,059
to feed in these rich
Arctic waters.

65
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,419
They stir up the tiny creatures

66
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,980
that are now flourishing here
with a special spinning dance.

67
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,700
All excellent fuel as they hurry
to rear the next generation.

68
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:34,699
The Arctic terns have made an even
longer journey to breed here.

69
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:39,540
They have flown 11,000 miles
from the Antarctic.

70
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,339
Their newly-hatched chicks
will need to grow fast

71
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,739
if they're to accompany
their parents

72
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,900
when they return south
in only six weeks' time.

73
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,739
An eider duck has chosen to nest
in the centre of the tern colony.

74
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,460
Hardly a tranquil place
to raise your young.

75
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,939
But the noisy neighbours
have a feisty attitude to life,

76
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,059
and that can be very valuable.

77
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,300
SQUAWKING

78
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,339
A hungry bear looking for a meal

79
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,619
can destroy hundreds of nests

80
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,900
in a single raid.

81
00:11:30,901 --> 00:11:32,739
Defensive squadrons of terns

82
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,100
take off immediately.

83
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,899
Sharp beaks stab down from above.

84
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,180
The bear has nothing in his armoury
that can cope with this.

85
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,860
The terns have drawn blood
from his muzzle.

86
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,539
He leaves in search

87
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,180
of an easier meal.

88
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,420
The eiders survive, thanks
to their choice of neighbours.

89
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,980
And the ducklings begin
their sprint to maturity.

90
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,979
Fishing continues around the clock

91
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:49,659
as the terns race
to rear their young

92
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,620
before the return of the freeze.

93
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:06,259
So the rich waters of summer fuel
the breeding of all these visitors

94
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,779
and enable them to build up
the reserves they will need

95
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,060
for the long return journey south.

96
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,779
Inland, the winter snows have gone,

97
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,740
revealing a vast
treeless wilderness.

98
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:42,379
The male snowy owl
is finding plenty of lemmings

99
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,220
to bring to his mate.

100
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,860
But they're not just for her.

101
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:02,180
She is brooding their rather
scruffy young.

102
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,459
She tears the meal
into beak-sized chunks

103
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:09,379
that the owlets can swallow whole.

104
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:12,060
Each of them
can eat two lemmings a day.

105
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,739
The male has no time to rest.

106
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,379
Over the course of the summer,
he will have to provide his family

107
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,380
with over 1,000 lemmings.

108
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:37,860
The hungry owlets keep the adults
working around the clock.

109
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,420
The Arctic summer may be short,
but the days are long.

110
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:51,699
Everyone must take advantage
of the 24-hour daylight.

111
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:56,499
None more so than the owls' tiny
neighbours, the Lapland buntings.

112
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,940
SQUAWKING

113
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:14,180
Both parents feed their
growing family continuously.

114
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:28,379
A mere ten days after hatching,

115
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,380
and they will all have left
in record time.

116
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,820
The last needs
a little encouragement.

117
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,539
The owlets have also left
their nest

118
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,539
and turned into football-sized
balls of fluff.

119
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:57,500
But they still depend on their
parents for food and protection.

120
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,739
A skua.

121
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,020
Their mother's talons
are her best weapons.

122
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:35,579
The owlets are dangerously exposed
out on the tundra,

123
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,699
so they must hurry to change
from balls of fluff

124
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,619
to fully-feathered adults.

125
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:44,100
And to do that,
they need... more lemmings.

126
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,740
A lemming doesn't last long
these days.

127
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:10,500
Times are harder for the wolves
here in the high Arctic.

128
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:30,780
The cubs are now six weeks old
and increasingly hungry.

129
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:46,700
The adults have to struggle
to feed their growing family.

130
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,419
Somewhere on this vast expanse
of tundra,

131
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,500
there must be larger prey.

132
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:12,780
Musk oxen are on the move.

133
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,699
They're heading into the valleys,

134
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,460
where the brief summer rains
will produce fresh grazing.

135
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,539
This is an opportunity
that must be seized,

136
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:42,780
even if it means
travelling 80 miles in a day.

137
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,740
Their task is a formidable one.

138
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,779
Musk oxen are immensely powerful

139
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,740
and their sharp horns can kill.

140
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:16,419
A heavily-armoured bull
would be an unwise choice.

141
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:20,500
Even two wolves would find it
a struggle to bring it down.

142
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,620
A calf.

143
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,180
Much easier.

144
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,739
The two wolves work together

145
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,580
to split the herd
and isolate their victim.

146
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,940
It seems that the wolf cubs
will at last eat well.

147
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,940
But the herd regroups.

148
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,940
The cavalry ride to the rescue.

149
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:51,180
The whole herd encircles the calf
with a protective wall of horns.

150
00:20:56,180 --> 00:21:00,460
For the musk oxen,
it's all for one and one for all.

151
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,659
For the wolves, another attack

152
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,740
would be not only futile,
but dangerous.

153
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,699
They have spent a lot of energy

154
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,540
and have nothing whatever
to show for it.

155
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,380
FORLORN HOWL

156
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:46,979
Their failure will be felt
most keenly back at the den.

157
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,660
HOWLING

158
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:03,380
They have nothing
to take back to the family.

159
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,700
HOWLING

160
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:27,780
The pack are forced to move on
in search of better hunting.

161
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,739
They must find something soon

162
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,699
in this vast wilderness

163
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,820
to feed their growing family.

164
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,900
The brief Arctic summer
is almost over.

165
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,060
FAINT SQUAWKING

166
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,659
At the southern end of the planet,

167
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:10,379
the long summer days
transform life,

168
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:14,740
just as they do in the north,
but the cast here is very different.

169
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,460
King penguins.

170
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:31,339
A parent, returning with food,
must recognise its chick's call

171
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:34,500
amongst a chorus of 400,000 birds.

172
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:59,459
Huge colonies like this one

173
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:04,020
are found all along
the north coast of South Georgia.

174
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:11,179
King penguins are active
throughout the long summer days,

175
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:15,180
so they have to deal with
an uncharacteristic polar problem.

176
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,099
By midday,
the temperature can reach

177
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:30,420
a sizzling 17 degrees centigrade.

178
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,459
Any effort can
lead to overheating.

179
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:41,460
It's best not to overexert oneself.

180
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:48,379
The heavily-insulated penguins
stretch out

181
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,740
so their naked feet
can cool in the breeze.

182
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:06,419
Their gigantic neighbours
use a different approach.

183
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:11,859
Wet sand cools the backs
of these elephant seals,

184
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,860
and also acts as a sunscreen.

185
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:27,099
The chicks, in their downy coats
that have kept them warm all winter,

186
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,580
are in even greater danger
of overheating.

187
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,739
It will be two months
before they can swim properly,

188
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:54,020
but a dip in a shallow river
brings a little relief.

189
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:16,260
There is, however,
another way to cool the blood.

190
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:24,460
This murky pool
has become a penguin spa.

191
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,739
It's a great way to cool the feet,

192
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,859
but there is no reason
to stop there.

193
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:41,020
You can indulge yourself
with the full treatment.

194
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:58,060
Mud, glorious mud!

195
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:14,339
For the fully-feathered adults,

196
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,780
there's a cleaner,
more invigorating option.

197
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:25,700
The bracing waters
of the Southern Ocean.

198
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:32,459
The 100-mile-long island
of South Georgia

199
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,860
lies on the northern fringe
of Antarctica.

200
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:47,299
Ice-free all year,
its rich coastal waters

201
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:51,500
make it a popular breeding
destination for all beach lovers.

202
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:04,579
In summer,
95% of the world's population

203
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:07,740
of Antarctic fur seals come here.

204
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,419
Packed tightly together, they form

205
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:14,780
one of the densest gatherings
of marine mammals on Earth.

206
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,579
The island's beaches
are filling fast

207
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:25,460
and will soon be crammed with five
million of these summer visitors.

208
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:33,339
Space is at a premium, as every
female needs a dry patch of sand

209
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:36,260
the size of a beach towel
for herself.

210
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,980
And for good reason.

211
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:56,620
Virtually all of them give birth
within just ten days.

212
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:13,539
It's crucial to establish
a strong bond with your baby

213
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:16,300
in such a crowded colony.

214
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:28,660
The pups grow quickly
on rich, high-fat milk.

215
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:42,139
After giving birth,
the females are ready to mate,

216
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,499
so each male guards
up to 15 of them

217
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,419
in his small patch of beach.

218
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:52,300
'A bull may only hold a territory
for one season in his entire life.

219
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:58,660
So when a challenger arrives, he
will risk everything to retain it.

220
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,820
Their sharp teeth
inflict terrible injuries.

221
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:54,660
Many bulls die from exhaustion
after these fights.

222
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:03,980
In the heat of the battle,
the pups are also in real danger.

223
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:24,019
The defeated bull makes his escape,

224
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:27,540
but the colony still suffers
from the side-effects of the battle.

225
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:40,459
Many of the pups get lost
in the violence and confusion.

226
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,340
FORLORN BARKING

227
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,340
This time, there is a happy ending.

228
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,099
As summer progresses,

229
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:34,820
even more of the Southern Ocean
is gradually opening up.

230
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,659
The summer melt, as it moves south,

231
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:49,059
arrives first
at the Antarctic Peninsula,

232
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,340
the most northern tip
of the continent.

233
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:59,819
As the ice retreats,
a dramatic 500-mile-long coastline

234
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:03,300
is revealed for the first time
in seven months.

235
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,899
This new seascape is home

236
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:16,620
to one of the most numerous mammals
on the planet.

237
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,539
Crabeater seals.

238
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:24,820
Over 15 million live here,
amongst the drifting ice floes.

239
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:39,539
They owe their existence here
to living organisms so small,

240
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,220
you might hardly notice them.

241
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:48,900
The underside of the sea ice
is stained by algae.

242
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,299
These microscopic plants

243
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:56,500
support the most important
Antarctic creatures of all.

244
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:00,419
Krill.

245
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:04,860
They have been grazing on the
algal layer throughout the winter.

246
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:11,260
As the ice melts, more of the algae
are released into the water.

247
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:17,900
Both algae and krill
flourish in the summer sun.

248
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:28,099
The krill collect the algae
in the sieve-like basket

249
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,780
formed by the interlocking hairs
between their front legs.

250
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:46,059
There are 300-million tonnes
of krill in the Southern Ocean,

251
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,219
with a greater combined weight

252
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:51,100
than that of any other animal
on the planet.

253
00:35:56,140 --> 00:36:00,379
Almost all the animals
of the Antarctic depend on krill,

254
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:03,860
including its giants.

255
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,020
Humpback whales.

256
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:20,419
They drive the krill to the surface

257
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,179
and then strain it from the water

258
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,620
with the baleen sieves
in their mouths.

259
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,859
Humpbacks often feed in teams,

260
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:47,619
so the overspill
from one huge mouth

261
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:50,380
can be collected by another
just behind.

262
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:29,539
The abundance of krill
attracts other visitors

263
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,820
to the peninsula in the summer.

264
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:37,019
Antarctic minke whales.

265
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,899
Their pointed heads
and short dorsal fins

266
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,540
give them speed and endurance.

267
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,980
And they need both.

268
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,860
There are other whales here, too.

269
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,820
Killers.

270
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:15,780
This is an extended family
of mothers and their young.

271
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:21,659
And a male with a huge dorsal fin

272
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:24,140
almost two metres high.

273
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,620
A lone minke whale.

274
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:47,060
It's just what this group
of killer whales are looking for.

275
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:53,859
Working as a team,
as they have done for decades,

276
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:57,660
they fan out across the strait
in search of their quarry.

277
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,019
And they've found it!

278
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:14,700
The minke races away,
pursued by outriders on each flank.

279
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,940
Terrified,
the minke heads for the shore.

280
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:51,900
It's so desperate to escape,
it almost beaches itself.

281
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:05,740
It makes a desperate
break for freedom.

282
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,699
Two hours and 20 miles later,

283
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:20,340
the minke is still alive
and swimming strongly.

284
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:26,059
Its only real defence
is its endurance.

285
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,979
But the killers work as a team,

286
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:31,380
with fresh ones replacing
the outriders in relays.

287
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:48,820
And as the minke tires,
the battering and the biting begins.

288
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:05,939
Seabirds are attracted
by the smell of fresh blood

289
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,740
rising from the water.

290
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:28,859
The killers try to flip
the minke over.

291
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:33,340
If they can manage to keep its
blowhole underwater, it will drown.

292
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:42,980
One forces the minke's whole body
down below the surface.

293
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,780
And then, the final strike.

294
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:09,339
The team drag the minke under
for the last time.

295
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,980
And the hunters, finally, can feed.

296
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,819
As the summer advances,

297
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:34,019
the most southerly stretches
of the Antarctic Ocean

298
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:36,180
are released from the ice.

299
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:49,220
Adelie penguins have been
feeding in the open ocean.

300
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,979
The most southerly of all penguins,

301
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:06,299
they're returning
to the Antarctic continent

302
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:09,100
with stomachs full of krill.

303
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:06,179
The sea ice has finally retreated
all the way back to the beach,

304
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:10,979
so the walk back to the colony
is as short as it will ever be.

305
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:13,659
Crucial for
the half-million penguins here

306
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:18,020
who are hurrying to raise their
chicks before the freeze returns.

307
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:25,100
Most of the pairs
have two chicks to care for.

308
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:31,139
Each chick requires
nearly 30 kilograms of food

309
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:33,060
before it's fully grown.

310
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:39,619
Most of their catch is krill,

311
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:41,779
and Adelie penguins
consume a staggering

312
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:45,540
1.5 million tonnes of it a year.

313
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:57,260
'There are no land-based
predators in Antarctica.

314
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:03,740
The threat here
comes from the skies.

315
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,900
A South polar skua.

316
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:39,100
An unguarded chick
is an easy catch.

317
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:09,860
Nothing can save the chick now.

318
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:32,460
But now the parents can focus
all their attention on the second.

319
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:57,539
Only half of these chicks
will survive to adulthood.

320
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:00,259
But there are thousands more
parents with young

321
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:02,220
in this huge colony.

322
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:09,499
Parents that cannot rest, for
their young must be fit and strong

323
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:13,460
if they're to survive the dangers
that autumn will bring.

324
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,659
Next time ... Autumn.

325
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:44,740
And the sun starts to set
on the frozen planet.

326
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:51,460
The race is on to finish breeding
before the big freeze.

327
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:18,419
In summer, the frozen oceans melt

328
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:22,500
and the polar animals disperse
to feed amongst the broken ice.

329
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:27,939
So, even finding them
in this vast expanse of sea

330
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:30,780
and drifting ice floes
wouldn't be easy.

331
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:40,499
In the Arctic, the aim was to get
close to a polar bear family

332
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,100
and film them
in this fast-melting world.

333
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,619
Firstly, the team had to use

334
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:56,179
a ship capable of breaking through
the pack ice

335
00:48:56,180 --> 00:49:00,140
around the 2,000-mile-long
coastline of Svalbard.

336
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:07,059
Producer Miles Barton
and cameraman Ted Giffords

337
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:11,739
are checking out fjords
known to be frequented by bears.

338
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:16,219
We've just seen a bear walking around
in front of a glacier over there.

339
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:19,059
We've just arrived, so this is
a test, more than anything,

340
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:22,419
but we're going to go and see
if we can film it.

341
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:25,740
We're seeing how smoothly
we can make this operation work.

342
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:36,900
"Stay on Channel Six. Can you give
me directions to the bear, please?"

343
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:42,299
The plan is that the team's
stabilised aerial camera,

344
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,339
now fitted to the speedboat,

345
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:48,259
will give perfectly stable shots
of the bear swimming.

346
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:52,179
If we spin this around, we'll lose
it. The fellow's over here, yeah?

347
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:55,660
Oh, yeah, got him! I can't get
any tighter. You shoot it?

348
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:01,020
Whey!

349
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:06,659
That's nice. Nice sparkle,
nice liquid look.

350
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:09,260
Let's let him go. OK. Cut.

351
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:17,140
After their initial success, the
weather takes a turn for the worse.

352
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:24,500
For five days,
there are no more polar bears.

353
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:30,699
The captain decides to take a break

354
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:33,900
and parks up in the pack ice.

355
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:40,620
After all that fruitless searching
by the crew, a bear visits them.

356
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:48,580
A large and inquisitive
adult male.

357
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:57,740
So the team decides to follow him.

358
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:03,379
The open water
between boat and bear

359
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:05,619
means the crew can safely film

360
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:09,739
from surprisingly close range
without disturbing him.

361
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:12,140
That's nice. Oop!

362
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:18,059
The bear is so relaxed,

363
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:21,019
he even begins to hunt
right alongside them.

364
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:24,539
He's looking for a seal inside.

365
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:26,739
But he's just completely ignoring us.

366
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:29,659
Just hold it there.
Just hold it there for a minute.

367
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:32,900
He's going to climb up. OK. Ready?

368
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:37,940
Ha-ha! That's a big bear!

369
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:44,620
That's pretty good, pretty good.

370
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:48,460
The closest we've been
to a polar bear so far.

371
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:53,059
Despite this remarkably
close encounter,

372
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:57,619
the team still wants to film
a family of bears.

373
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:01,939
"There's these females and two cubs
to the starboard side.

374
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:05,059
"She's at two..."
There's good news on the radio.

375
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:09,619
Oh, there's a cub.
Yeah, I've seen the cubs.

376
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:12,499
They're looking straight at us.
Look at that.

377
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,219
That's amazing!

378
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:16,339
As the mother looks
distinctly hungry,

379
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:21,059
they will need to keep
at least 15 feet of open water

380
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:23,419
between her and the boat.

381
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:26,019
Having a good look at us.

382
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:29,460
Oh, look at them! Look at the cubs!
Yeah. Ha-ha!

383
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:37,500
Jason, just go when you need to.

384
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:42,940
Oop, here she comes. Bloody hell!

385
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:48,019
Mother bears are always desperate
for food for their cubs,

386
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:51,459
so the crew could be
the perfect supper.

387
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:54,900
She's getting in. Oh, my God, she's
going to come in the water there.

388
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:58,859
The 15-foot gap was just enough.

389
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:00,540
God, that was amazing!

390
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:09,780
We have to go. OK.

391
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:14,419
Do you want to get close up
to the cubs? Still rolling.

392
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:17,339
Yeah, that's cute.
She's going in the water. OK.

393
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:20,499
And then I'm going to stay
with the cubs.

394
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:23,140
With the cubs for a nice splash.

395
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:30,099
Go on, cubs. Yeah! Hey!

396
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:32,259
Well done! Well done!

397
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:33,740
Great stuff!

398
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:38,220
She looked like
she wanted to get in the boat.

399
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:44,059
Sometimes, it's quite shocking
to actually look up from the monitor

400
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:46,459
and realise they're about 15 feet
away from you.

401
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:48,540
But, um, a lovely family group.

402
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:54,219
The boat-based camera has helped

403
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:57,059
to get remarkably close shots
of the bear family,

404
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:59,979
but how would it cope
in the more extreme conditions

405
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:01,340
of the Southern Ocean?

406
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:14,419
Another Frozen Planet team
headed south.

407
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:18,459
The plan is to use the same camera
system to film the hunting strategy

408
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:23,420
of the most spectacular
marine predators in Antarctica.

409
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:26,100
Killer whales.

410
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:31,899
The team enlisted the help
of scientists Bob Pitman

411
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:33,619
and John Durban.

412
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:35,819
They had put satellite tags
on the whales,

413
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:39,940
and so could locate them
for the camera team.

414
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:45,339
Doug Allan operates the camera rig
from the wheelhouse,

415
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:49,059
while Doug Anderson
films from the deck.'

416
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:50,979
Yeah, there. See it?

417
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:53,459
It just surfaced right with them.

418
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:55,859
OK, there's a killer whale at 11:00,

419
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:59,259
about 200 metres heading towards
those two seals on the floe.

420
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:01,180
Good. This could be really good.

421
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:06,059
At last, having tracked the group
for several days,

422
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:09,019
the whales look as if
they are about to hunt.

423
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:11,140
Yeah, they're going to go in for it.

424
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,380
There it goes.

425
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:23,099
Four whales there.
Um, two adult females,

426
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:25,659
a juvenile and a big adult male.

427
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:28,619
Swimming in formation,
the killers create a wave

428
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:31,739
to wash the seal off the floe.

429
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:33,979
It's all pretty intense.

430
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:35,460
Oh. There's another wave.

431
00:55:35,461 --> 00:55:38,620
Yes. Wave! Wow!

432
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:42,099
Yeah, he's in the water.

433
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:44,739
Having successfully filmed
several hunts

434
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:46,779
with the boat-based cameras
from above,

435
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:50,140
the team are keen to see
what's happening underwater.

436
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:54,420
Only one way to find out.

437
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:00,660
Time to launch the dinghy.

438
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:11,059
Doug Anderson approaches the seal
and the killers

439
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:14,380
with an underwater camera
mounted on a pole.

440
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:25,579
For the first time,
the team can see

441
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:30,380
how the whales create
the killer wave. There it is.

442
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:35,379
The underwater camera also reveals

443
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:39,139
surprisingly cautious behaviour
by the whales.

444
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:43,460
They seem wary of being bitten
by the much smaller seal.

445
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:48,299
And they even blow bubbles
to confuse it.

446
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:51,299
They're so cautious with the seals.

447
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:54,539
At the end of the day, the seal's
got a big mouth full of teeth,

448
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:56,620
and these whales
just don't take risks.

449
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:07,739
Having dealt with the seal,

450
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:10,699
the whales turn their attention
to the dinghy.

451
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:13,979
First, they get right up close

452
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:16,260
for a better look at Doug.

453
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:25,979
Then they line up to create
the kind of wave

454
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:27,939
that washed the seal off the floe.

455
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:30,100
Oooh!

456
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,779
For a moment, the crew
get an uncomfortably close

457
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:38,580
seal's eye view of this remarkable
hunting strategy.

458
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:48,500
Look! See that?
The juvies are making waves.

459
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:54,099
It's a great feeling being there.
Being so close to the behaviour,

460
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:56,299
having the water
coming into the boat.

461
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:58,219
From our point of view, you know,

462
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:02,099
it's all about trying to get the
feeling of being with these whales.

463
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:05,939
With these whales, there's no bother
with that. They're so confident.

464
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:08,659
They just want to be all around you
and checking you out.

465
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:13,059
I can't imagine I'll have another
experience like this in my career.

466
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:15,419
You know, these come along rarely.

467
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:19,779
And you just feel happy and lucky
when... when they do come.

468
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:22,380
You just don't get better
days than that.

469
