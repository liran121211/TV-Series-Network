1
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,480
The polar winter.

2
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,640
This is the planet
at its most hostile.

3
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,359
Those that stay here at this time

4
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,000
must face the harshest conditions
on Earth.

5
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,759
The High Arctic in late autumn.

6
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:33,000
Empty and abandoned to ice and snow.

7
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,640
Most animals migrated
south weeks ago.

8
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,999
The few that stay
will face violent winds,

9
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,920
plunging temperatures
and months of darkness.

10
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,680
A female polar bear
searches for shelter.

11
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,519
Other bears are out on
the frozen ocean looking for food,

12
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,880
but she won't feed again
until next spring.

13
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,159
Using as little energy as possible,

14
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,920
she starts to dig a shallow nest.

15
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,439
The snow here is easy to work.

16
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,199
It's soft and light.

17
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,839
A sure sign that soon, plenty more
will accumulate on this slope

18
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,680
as winter advances.

19
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,000
And that is what she needs.

20
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,559
If she has chosen well,

21
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,840
the Arctic wind will do
much of her work for her.

22
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,879
Once the snow here is deep enough,

23
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,559
she will dig down to make a den.

24
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,640
She'll then lie, waiting for her
cubs to be born as winter sets in.

25
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,359
The sea ice already covers
twice the area it did in summer.

26
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,759
Those animals that, a few weeks ago,

27
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,240
came down here to feed in the sea,
are now locked out.

28
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,159
But there are windows
in this white desert.

29
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,040
Gateways to the rich ocean below.

30
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,879
Most birds have migrated south.

31
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,799
But in the frozen Bering Sea,

32
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,959
ducks of one particular species

33
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,680
are gathering together
in a single, immense flock.

34
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,240
Spectacled eiders.

35
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,480
Hundreds of thousands of them.

36
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,639
With the seas that fed them
throughout the summer

37
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,760
all but frozen,
this is the eider's last refuge.

38
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,359
Such patches of open water,

39
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,599
kept free of ice by strong currents,

40
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,440
are given a Russian name, polynyas.

41
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,999
If this polynya stays open
all winter,

42
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,800
the ducks will have avoided
an exhausting migration.

43
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,799
It's a gamble and a tremendous risk,

44
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,079
especially for the spectacled eider,

45
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,800
for this polynya
holds the world's entire population.

46
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,599
Surrounded by ice,
these spectacled eiders' survival

47
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,680
depends on this single,
vulnerable oasis.

48
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,160
And conditions here
can change very fast.

49
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,440
A smaller pool.

50
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:25,559
Here, common eider ducks
are learning a bitter lesson.

51
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,999
An early winter storm
has caught them out

52
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,680
and the ice is closing in.

53
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:38,440
The pool is shrinking,
and the ducks are freezing to death.

54
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,360
These gamblers have lost.

55
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:18,339
As the sun's influence continues
to dwindle here in the north,

56
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:21,860
the cold pushes south
into Arctic lands.

57
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:44,539
Winter brings
a devastatingly-destructive force.

58
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,220
Frost.

59
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:55,300
Ice crystals form
as moisture in the air freezes.

60
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,699
Inside plants,
the same thing is happening

61
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,300
to the water in their cells
and their sap.

62
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,179
With these first frosts,
most plants die.

63
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:13,860
Their insides ripped apart
by ice crystals.

64
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:23,459
Coniferous trees, however,
like fir and pine,

65
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,020
can withstand very low temperatures.

66
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:33,180
It's these trees that create
the greatest forest on our planet.

67
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,460
This is the Taiga.

68
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:49,060
It encircles the globe and contains
one third of all the trees on earth.

69
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:04,699
As winter deepens,
frigid air from the Arctic

70
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,619
meets warm, moist air
from the south,

71
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,140
producing particularly heavy snows.

72
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,939
For the big animals of the forest,

73
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,980
there's no way of hiding
from the winter.

74
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,499
But size, for the Bison
of Northern Canada,

75
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,619
is, in fact, their salvation.

76
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,979
Big bodies lose less heat

77
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,739
and can carry more insulation.

78
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,099
That may be why these bison

79
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,580
are the largest land animals
in North America.

80
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,260
And only a large predator
can tackle them.

81
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,739
Wolves hunt better in packs,

82
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,940
but there are only two of them here
and the prey they pursue are giants.

83
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,900
A vast Arctic wilderness
stretches all around.

84
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,620
In it somewhere, there are bison.

85
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:38,019
These deep tracks in the snow
are easy to follow,

86
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,900
but which way were the bison going?

87
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,740
They have detected a scent.
The hunt is on.

88
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,539
Running in the bison's tracks
is easy.

89
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,660
The snow here is compressed
and firm.

90
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,180
At this rate,
the wolves will soon catch up.

91
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,219
They attempt a shortcut.

92
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:26,939
The giant bison can plough on
through virgin snow,

93
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,499
but for the wolves,
deep snow is a hindrance,

94
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,780
and now they're losing ground.

95
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:53,980
The hunters rejoin the bison's
tracks and the contest is on again.

96
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,979
The bison are the only prey here
in winter.

97
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,020
The wolves have no option,
they must tackle them.

98
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,260
But bison are ten times their size.

99
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:45,339
In winter, the line between
life and death is so narrow

100
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:49,260
that for a wolf, even a small injury
could be fatal.

101
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:53,340
It's crucial they select
the right target.

102
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,419
This one is very big.

103
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,420
Good decision.

104
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,980
This is smaller, a yearling.

105
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,419
Even though it's young,
it's none the less heavier

106
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:30,100
than both wolves combined
and it is extremely powerful.

107
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,259
The male wolf backs off.

108
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,859
Perhaps he's frightened of injury.

109
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,100
But the female is more determined,
or more desperate.

110
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:49,740
Having given so much already,
she must make the kill.

111
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:54,260
This is a battle of life and death
for them both.

112
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,300
The bison has no strength left.

113
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,700
The battle is over.

114
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:33,699
Winter deepens.
The snow continues to accumulate,

115
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,820
smothering the forest.

116
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:50,380
Some trees are loaded with
three tonnes of snow.

117
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,659
It shuts out what little light
there is at these latitudes,

118
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,939
and that shortens the growing season
still further

119
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:02,540
and limits how far north
trees are able to grow.

120
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:16,259
So, snow influences
both the shapes of the trees

121
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,620
and the extent of this forest.

122
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,739
And it affects the animals, too.

123
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,259
SQUAWK!

124
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,539
It helps to have friends

125
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,700
if you want to find food
at this time of the year.

126
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,540
Wolverines and ravens,
a match made in the Taiga.

127
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,859
It's the hardest time of the year
to find food.

128
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,499
But the wolverine knows
that a raven's call

129
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,580
is as good as a dinner bell.

130
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,900
And the raven has just recruited
the best can opener in the forest.

131
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,779
The moose carcass is frozen solid,

132
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:08,019
but the wolverine
has immensely powerful jaws,

133
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,299
well able to deal with frozen food.

134
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:15,260
The raven's bill
is more suited to leftovers.

135
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,260
The raven has to be patient.

136
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,819
A wolverine's appetite is legendary.

137
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:43,379
According to folklore,
it can eat more at one sitting

138
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,699
than any other creature
in the forest,

139
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,940
hence its other name, the glutton.

140
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,579
What the wolverine can't eat now,

141
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,139
it stores in the deep freeze.

142
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:08,859
It will bury these food parcels
across the forest,

143
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,380
planning ahead for leaner times.

144
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:25,220
For a few, the snow is an ally.

145
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:45,379
Voles stay active throughout
the winter beneath the snow,

146
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:48,700
despite the freezing temperatures
above.

147
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,259
Travelling along tiny corridors,

148
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:00,940
they move from pocket to pocket
of perfectly refrigerated food.

149
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:07,139
Snow is a great insulator,

150
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,259
so down here,
the temperature never falls

151
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,819
more than a degree or so below zero.

152
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,819
And that's warm enough
for a vole to thrive,

153
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,540
even if it lacks
the stature of a bison.

154
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,699
In some years, vole numbers boom,

155
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:33,580
and then they are forced to break
cover to search for more food.

156
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:05,579
The great grey owl is a silent
and very skilful hunter,

157
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,220
but deep snow
can be beyond its reach.

158
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,900
But such snow is no barrier
to one predator.

159
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,019
The least weasel.

160
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:27,220
A tiny hunter,
and the vole's nemesis.

161
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:34,899
Its body is exactly the same width
as a vole's,

162
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,980
so there's nowhere a vole can go
that the weasel can't follow.

163
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,740
INSTRUMENTAL

164
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,339
The weasel's long, slender shape

165
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,499
is perfect for hunting in tunnels,

166
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,619
but the worst possible shape
for staying warm.

167
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:33,340
So they need a special way
of doing that.

168
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:46,140
She plucks the fur from its body
tuft by tuft.

169
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:00,619
And now she puts it all together
to make a cosy blanket

170
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:04,300
under which to sleep
in her den below the snow.

171
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:26,699
Midwinter in the northern forests.

172
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,940
The sun is so low
that it's twilight at midday.

173
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,339
Further north in the high Arctic,

174
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,139
the sun has been below the horizon
for months

175
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:45,340
and it'll be several more
before it appears again.

176
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:39,140
The male polar bear spends winter
out on the frozen ocean.

177
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,820
Few creatures can endure
these conditions.

178
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,939
If he's lucky,
he will find a carcass

179
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,179
that could provide a little food,

180
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:59,260
possibly that of a fox
or another polar bear.

181
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:05,820
But otherwise,
he must live on his reserves.

182
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,980
This is the time to scrape by,
to wait.

183
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:26,779
But on lee-side slopes,
beneath the snow,

184
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,900
new lives are beginning.

185
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:52,379
The cubs are born blind and tiny.

186
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:56,180
An early birth is easier
on the mother, who is barely awake.

187
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,659
Despite her sleepiness,

188
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:15,860
her instinct to nurse
is overwhelming.

189
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:33,179
The cub's clucking calls

190
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,539
stimulate her to produce milk.

191
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,139
And what milk!

192
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,899
It's nine times richer than our own

193
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:43,460
and enables her to double
their weight every few weeks.

194
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,379
It's over two months

195
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:06,339
since the autumn snows
first arrived.

196
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,499
In two more months,
polar bear families

197
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,659
will emerge onto the snowy slopes

198
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,780
all around the Arctic.

199
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,179
But for now, they lie protected

200
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,420
within their icy cocoons.

201
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,379
A hundred miles above the earth,

202
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:48,020
the Aurora lights up the sky.

203
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:01,499
After travelling millions of miles
across space,

204
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:05,499
solar winds, attracted by
the magnetic pull of the poles,

205
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,780
collide with the earth's atmosphere.

206
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,579
Trillions of charged particles

207
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,660
dance across the sky.

208
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:26,339
Above the Arctic,
the Aurora Borealis...

209
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,539
the Northern Lights.

210
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:32,259
In the south,
it's the Aurora Australis...

211
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,779
the Southern lights,

212
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:36,940
that bring light
to Antarctica's long winter.

213
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:49,459
These spectacular lightshows
are only a tease.

214
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,419
Solar energy maybe,

215
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,540
but no warmth
that will help the emperor penguins.

216
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:10,379
The Arctic winter is brutally cold,

217
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,059
but in Antarctica,

218
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,820
the darkest months
are even more savage.

219
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:34,419
The male penguins
have not eaten for months,

220
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:37,860
and have only each other
for protection from the gales.

221
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,859
Each has been entrusted
with a single precious egg

222
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:53,619
balanced on the top of its feet.

223
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:57,139
If the egg were to drop onto
the ice, even for a moment,

224
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,739
the chick inside would die

225
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,180
and all this
would count for nothing.

226
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,679
The Weddell seal.

227
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,920
The only mammal to remain here
throughout the winter.

228
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,279
They must have breathing holes,

229
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,039
and so have to constantly
scrape away the ice

230
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,759
that threatens to close them,

231
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,919
rasping away fresh build-ups

232
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,480
with special wide-gaped jaws.

233
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:53,200
Beneath the ice, they are beyond the
reach of the bitter winter winds.

234
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,159
The sea is -2 degrees centigrade.

235
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,800
A warm bath, compared to
the conditions overhead.

236
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:21,040
The roof of ice insulates this world
from the wild fluctuations above.

237
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,559
The temperature down here
has barely changed

238
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,320
for 25 million years.

239
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:40,359
Of course,
animals must still be hardy.

240
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:44,599
These borchgrevinki fish
have antifreeze in their blood,

241
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,200
so they are untroubled
swimming among the ice crystals.

242
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,599
Many animals here
are remarkably long-lived,

243
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,480
perhaps because the conditions
are so stable.

244
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,559
Some sponges could be
a thousand years old

245
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,720
and large enough
for a human to hide in.

246
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,359
There could hardly be
a greater contrast

247
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:14,120
to the bleak, windswept world
just above.

248
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,400
But there is a constant danger here.

249
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,040
Swirling patterns in the water
reveal its presence.

250
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,919
They are made by brine.

251
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,399
Super-concentrated salt water.

252
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,400
It's a warning.

253
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,959
New sea ice forming above

254
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,279
leaves behind brine
that is so extremely salty,

255
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,120
it sinks rapidly.

256
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:29,879
As it descends, the sea water
around it freezes instantly

257
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:33,039
and forms a sheath of ice,
a brinicle,

258
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:36,000
that grows downwards
towards the seafloor.

259
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:50,480
Winter is reaching down
from the cold world above.

260
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,319
As it touches the seafloor,

261
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,159
it kills whatever living thing
it contacts

262
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,520
by encasing it in a tomb of ice.

263
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,799
Even in the relative warmth
of the water,

264
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,639
the lethal cold of winter

265
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,880
threatens life on the seafloor.

266
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:00,159
Another more constant attack
rises from below.

267
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,799
Pressure in the depths
keeps water liquid,

268
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,960
even though its temperature
is far from freezing.

269
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,999
Currents bring up this colder water,
but it turns to ice,

270
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,160
covering everything
that can't move away from it.

271
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,759
And then, the ice,
being lighter than water,

272
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,040
begins to float,
lifting away anything attached.

273
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:10,520
Even some of the faster-moving
animals are caught.

274
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,879
So the ice cleanses the seafloor

275
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,159
and strews the ceiling above

276
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,800
with remnants of life from below.

277
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,160
A sign that winter is nearly over.

278
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,479
The songs of male Weddell seals

279
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,920
challenging their rivals to battle.

280
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,280
The male seal's calls
can be heard over 15 miles away.

281
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,159
He aims to control
the best breathing holes

282
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,440
for they will determine
his mating rights in spring.

283
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,400
His calls create powerful
shockwaves in the water.

284
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,120
They are threats.

285
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,519
This hole has already been claimed,

286
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,160
and the owner will not surrender it
willingly.

287
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,639
No change this time.

288
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,720
The challenger will need to find
a hole with a weaker owner.

289
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,359
The battles continue
until the females arrive,

290
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,080
and that time is now close.

291
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,880
The sun returns to Antarctica.

292
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,959
The longest night on earth has ended

293
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,760
and winter begins
to give way to spring.

294
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,799
Female emperor penguins.

295
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,719
After four months feeding at sea,

296
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,640
they are returning sleek and fat.

297
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,760
Penguins, it seems,
can fly after all.

298
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:26,000
But a winter at sea has left them
a little out of practice.

299
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,679
There is no time to waste.

300
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,720
Far away, the males are waiting.

301
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,479
While the females were gone,
the sea ice grew,

302
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:41,280
and it's now twice the distance
from its edge back to their colony.

303
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:53,360
70 miles away, the males
are in desperate need of help.

304
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,199
Despite doing all they can
to conserve their energy,

305
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,600
many are close to dying
from starvation.

306
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,600
SQUAWK!

307
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,960
SQUAWK!

308
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,920
SQUAWKING

309
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,960
Reunited after three months apart.

310
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,279
The reward for her return?

311
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,760
A first glimpse of her chick.

312
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:22,320
The reunion made,
it's time for the handover.

313
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,320
The father finds it hard to let go.

314
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:36,480
Some gentle persuasion is needed.

315
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,959
He has endured the most appalling
conditions on earth

316
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,519
to ensure the survival of his chick,

317
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,080
and the bond is strong.

318
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,839
The exchange must be quick,

319
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:55,240
as the tiny chick, unprotected,
could freeze to death in seconds.

320
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,719
A task that began in autumn
has been completed.

321
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,679
Despite the huge odds against it,

322
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,279
the precious chick
has survived the winter

323
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,120
and is now with its mother.
And she has food.

324
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,760
The chick's first fresh meal.

325
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,080
Her mission is complete.

326
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,319
But for other mothers,

327
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:44,520
the journey ends in disappointment.

328
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:50,720
Their chicks have not survived.

329
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,399
The females' need to nurture
remains strong.

330
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,719
Any chick that strays from
its parent

331
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,240
is at grave risk of being kidnapped.

332
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:43,879
The chaos may be a consequence
of frustrated parental urge,

333
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,960
but the outcome can be tragic.

334
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,039
For those emperor penguins
that survive,

335
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,560
the worst is over for this year.

336
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,200
There will soon be
abundant food for everyone.

337
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:31,199
The emperors have taken on
the polar winter and won.

338
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,240
The gamble has paid off.

339
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,799
All other animals escaped,

340
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,759
only they remained
to raise their young.

341
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,919
And now, it is they
who will now benefit most

342
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,600
from the rich southern spring.

343
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:59,279
Another arrival is the certain
confirmation that spring is here.

344
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,999
The Adelies, having spent winter
at sea, have come back,

345
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,600
but they have not even mated yet,
let alone laid their eggs.

346
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,999
Now, at last,
the male emperors can return

347
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,400
to where they are most at home.

348
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,280
One season ends and another begins.

349
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,479
The penguins will soon
be joined by migrants

350
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:49,600
and the far south will bustle
with life for a few frantic months.

351
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:03,879
But there are only a special few,
