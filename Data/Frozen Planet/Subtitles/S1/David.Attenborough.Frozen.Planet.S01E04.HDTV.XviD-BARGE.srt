1
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:36,159
The end of the Arctic summer, and
the sun hasn't set for three months.

2
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,280
It's hard to imagine
the bitter cold will soon return.

3
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,799
Some will welcome
the chills of autumn, but for most,

4
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,320
time is running out before they
will have to retreat to the south.

5
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,919
Early autumn in the Canadian Arctic,

6
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,879
and polar bears are gathering
on the coastal strip,

7
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,040
waiting for the sea to freeze.

8
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,199
But a life spent
alone on the sea ice

9
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,400
is no preparation
for a crowded beach.

10
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,319
Such close contact with other
bears must be stressful.

11
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,680
Surely tempers will flare.

12
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:49,520
Over half a tonne of bear
slams into the other.

13
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,239
Polar bears will fight
to the death over mates,

14
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,479
but not in autumn.

15
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,639
Now these fearsome predators display

16
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,320
a surprisingly tolerant side
to their natures.

17
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,839
Being marooned on land means
the bears no longer have access

18
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,839
to the seals they usually hunt

19
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,760
and they have to
scrape by on whatever they can find.

20
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,799
Like bears the world over,
they're not choosy feeders.

21
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,839
They even turn vegetarian,

22
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,960
delicately picking out
berries from between the thorns.

23
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,199
There are plenty to go around

24
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,520
so there's no need
to squabble over them.

25
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,000
Any fighting is just for fun.

26
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,399
The bears select sparring partners
who are well-matched

27
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,519
and they always pull their punches,

28
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,000
no-one wants to get hurt
in a play-fight.

29
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:59,039
Perhaps these bouts are a way
of testing rivals

30
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,440
in case they ever meet again
out on the sea ice.

31
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,159
One thing's for sure,
the famous loners

32
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,720
are revealing a social,
playful side we rarely see.

33
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,959
It's all just boisterous fun
but with so many big males around,

34
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,880
the females keep their cubs
at a safe distance.

35
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,239
The wary mother will lead her
young to a quieter beach

36
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,120
along the coast while
she waits for the ocean to freeze.

37
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,359
The sea ice is
now at its minimum extent.

38
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,239
In the Canadian Arctic,
vast stretches of coastline

39
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,280
are now unlocked
and ready to receive visitors.

40
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,439
Belugas ...
the white whales of the North.

41
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,920
They're relying on open water
to reach an ancient rendezvous.

42
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,960
It's a journey they make every
year along traditional routes.

43
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:24,280
Baby belugas ride piggy-back, pulled
along by their mother's slip stream.

44
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,959
This one is only a month old,

45
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,720
and won't turn
white for another five years.

46
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:46,359
Thousands of belugas are being
drawn to one special estuary

47
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,640
in the Canadian Arctic.

48
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,240
It isn't food that brings them here.

49
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,000
Curiously, it's personal hygiene.

50
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,399
When the tide is low
they swim into the shallows

51
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,880
and flail around with great
enthusiasm.

52
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,240
They're after a body scrub.

53
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,559
The gravel acts as a loofah

54
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,480
and thrashing their bodies across it

55
00:07:40,481 --> 00:07:42,920
helps to get rid of their old skin.

56
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,119
Presumably the treatment keeps
them clean and streamlined,

57
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,920
but it also appears to feel good.

58
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,640
Bliss!

59
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,279
The water in the estuary is warmer
and less salty

60
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,880
and that seems to soften the skin
making the scrub more effective.

61
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:56,439
This secluded estuary is only
a temporary whale spa,

62
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,320
the ocean will soon freeze again
forcing the whales to travel south.

63
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,600
Vast seabird colonies
are the jewels of the Arctic.

64
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,559
Brunnich's guillemots have spent
the summer months packed together

65
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,600
on vertical cliffs
beyond the reach of predators.

66
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,239
They are among the most numerous
seabirds in the Northern hemisphere.

67
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,839
This colony alone
contains 100,000 birds

68
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,240
and there are many more like it
all along the Arctic coastline.

69
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,519
In just a few weeks
these cliffs will empty

70
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,080
but before the guillemots can leave,
their chicks must fledge.

71
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,519
Their feathers are now fully formed,
but their stubby wings

72
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:20,040
are still too short for them to fly
properly ... this will be a challenge.

73
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:29,680
It's a 150 metre drop and they need
to make it all the way to the sea.

74
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,920
Here goes.

75
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,000
He falls short
and survives the crash landing.

76
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,200
The chicks are manna from heaven
for an Arctic fox.

77
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,400
The next chick is
accompanied by a parent.

78
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,440
Failed again.

79
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,920
This looks better!

80
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,320
Success!

81
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,359
Aquatic landings
are certainly gentler

82
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,800
and foxes can't reach you out here.

83
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,080
The chicks will stay in their
parents' care for another month.

84
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,199
The guillemots are not the only
ones preparing to leave,

85
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,759
all across the Arctic millions of
summer visitors

86
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,800
are beginning to return south.

87
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,679
The guillemot chicks can't fly yet,

88
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,560
so they and their families must swim
to their winter feeding grounds.

89
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,159
It's a journey that will take them
a thousand miles south

90
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,720
to the open ocean
and away from the approaching ice.

91
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:11,400
The breeding season is over
and silence returns to the Arctic.

92
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,679
But as the first storms of autumn

93
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,279
sweep through the deserted
nesting grounds,

94
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:28,960
they bring an unexpected bonanza
for the few that remain.

95
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,320
The discovery doesn't remain
secret for long.

96
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,120
It's a huge fin whale carcass.

97
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,439
The polar bears have been drawn
from several miles away,

98
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,600
guided by their extraordinary
sense of smell.

99
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,279
Bears are arriving all the time,

100
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:10,640
but there's plenty of room at this
18 metre long dining table.

101
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,559
They're surprisingly relaxed,

102
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,640
but with enough for everyone
there's no need to argue.

103
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,560
The tastiest morsels are often
underwater.

104
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,480
Others prefer some greens
with their dinner.

105
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,519
After a well-balanced meal,

106
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,560
there's nothing better
than some good company.

107
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,599
Despite their reputation as loners,

108
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,480
it's surprising just how sociable
polar bears can be.

109
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,079
All across the Arctic
the temperature is now dropping

110
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,639
and the sea is beginning to freeze.

111
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,719
Every day over 20,000
square miles of ocean

112
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,320
turn to ice as the cold
spreads south.

113
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:29,320
At first, a thin, greasy film
appears on the surface

114
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,480
Next, pancakes of ice start to
appear.

115
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:10,920
The pancakes lock together
and form a continuous sheet.

116
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,560
The Arctic Ocean is freezing again.

117
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:39,720
At last the bear family can return
to the sea ice where they belong.

118
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:55,600
It's been six months since the cubs
first emerged from the den.

119
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,719
They've survived the hazards of
melting sea ice in spring

120
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,759
and lack of food in summer

121
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,480
and now, at last, they
are in their element again.

122
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,039
As the north of our planet turns
away from the sun,

123
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,800
the big chill travels south.

124
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,240
Temperatures on
the tundra start to fall.

125
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,119
The shorter days and colder nights
trigger a dramatic change

126
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,159
in the willows
and blueberry bushes.

127
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,879
They stop producing green pigment
that harnesses the sun's energy

128
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,160
and red and yellow pigments build
up in their leaves.

129
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:05,440
The tundra blazes with colour and
the whole landscape is transformed.

130
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:25,959
A bull musk ox marks his territory
with scent from glands on his face.

131
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,200
He's preparing for the breeding
season.

132
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,599
He shadows his harem
of females as they graze

133
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,720
the last of the summer grasses.

134
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,800
He must be on his guard.

135
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,719
An outsider is arriving,

136
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,720
a large male whose intentions
soon become clear.

137
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,080
The newcomer circles
the resident bull warily.

138
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,040
The resident must take up
the intruder's challenge.

139
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:37,000
This clash of Polar Titans could
easily become a fight to the death.

140
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:53,640
The impact is like a car crash
at 30 miles an hour.

141
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,839
A heavy skull and a helmet of horn
four inches thick

142
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,560
provides some protection
for the musk ox's brain.

143
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,039
Over the next half hour,
the advantage ebbs and flows

144
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:46,119
as each tries to finish the duel.

145
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,760
If one can turn the other and gore
its flank, the fight will be over.

146
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:04,720
The stakes rise as the risk
of injury, or even death, increases.

147
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,960
The rival is out-manoeuvred.

148
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,080
And the champion returns
to his females.

149
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,399
By now most animals have migrated
south, but the musk oxen,

150
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:42,080
with their thick coats, will stay
and face the approaching winter.

151
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,199
As autumn progresses,
the moisture in the air freezes

152
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,160
and hoarfrost decorates the leaves.

153
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,840
Ice crystals grow like diamonds
on every twig.

154
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:56,760
All across the tundra, both the
rivers and the ground freeze solid.

155
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:31,079
Glassy cathedrals
form as the remaining water

156
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,480
becomes locked up as ice.

157
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,400
Soon even the largest
waterfalls will be motionless.

158
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,959
The tundra has been transformed
once again.

159
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,000
It appears deserted.

160
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,400
Caribou on their migration.

161
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,519
Unlike the musk ox, caribou do head
south for the winter,

162
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,200
but it's a long
and difficult journey.

163
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:18,799
They use the frozen lakes as ice
roads ... these are flat and firm...

164
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:23,160
but it seems hooves and ice were
never really meant to go together.

165
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:35,279
The frisky males would be well
advised to keep

166
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:39,080
at least one eye on the road
as the mating season begins.

167
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,919
A cow is being closely
guarded by a mature bull,

168
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,560
with his much larger antlers.

169
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,239
The females are busy
feeding-up for the winter,

170
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,240
but the bull has other
things on his mind.

171
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,280
The cow is playing hard to get.

172
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,320
She heads off
with her admirer in pursuit.

173
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,360
Several other bulls
join in the chase.

174
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:53,040
She's out in front but the amorous
males are gaining on her.

175
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,920
The big bull breaks off his chase
to deal with a rival.

176
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,160
But now he's fallen
behind the other challengers.

177
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,079
The younger bulls, with
their lighter antlers,

178
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,119
keep up with the cow more easily,

179
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,760
but as the pace slows,
the older bull catches up.

180
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,920
Again he has to stop and fight.

181
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,159
A decisive victory for the big male.

182
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,479
He's earned the respect
of the vanquished bulls

183
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,040
and they now trail in his wake.

184
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:12,519
It's now become a game
of Grandma's footsteps,

185
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:19,160
one look from the boss and the
young-bloods freeze in their tracks.

186
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:32,439
The exhausted bull guards his prize,
but he'll need to recover

187
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:36,479
before he is able to make the most
of his victory,

188
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,399
and the herd continues
its journey south

189
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:44,480
to avoid the worst of the
advancing cold.

190
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,719
From the ocean to the tundra,

191
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,680
the north of our planet is now
completely frozen.

192
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,919
The Antarctic.

193
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:12,159
In the far south,
autumn can be a particularly savage

194
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,200
and unpredictable time.

195
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,759
South Georgia is a splinter of rock
in the middle

196
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,319
of the vast Southern Ocean.

197
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,480
It's only a hundred miles long
and is battered by the elements.

198
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,399
This ocean generates some
of the largest waves on the planet,

199
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:43,159
they gain size and power as
they travel around the globe,

200
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,560
uninterrupted by land
for 12,000 miles.

201
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:54,240
As they buffet South Georgia,
they also bring food.

202
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,480
A seal carcass.

203
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,760
A prize worth braving the surf for.

204
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:10,199
Giant petrels are the vultures
of Antarctica,

205
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,480
and are always the first to
the spoils.

206
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:30,320
The word is out,
and the hordes move in.

207
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,600
Like feathered dinosaurs
they lock beaks in battle.

208
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:35,440
These butchers provide a service
for some unlikely meat-eaters.

209
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:43,640
With the carcasses now opened,
pintail ducks arrive for a meal.

210
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,399
There's plenty of good food here
and none of South Georgia's

211
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:56,400
inhabitants can afford to be fussy
with winter looming.

212
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,240
After the feast it's
time for a rinse and spin.

213
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:21,239
The breeding season is finally over

214
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,839
and the petrels will soon
be heading out to sea

215
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,920
to avoid the worst of the winter.

216
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,320
A snowstorm is
an omen of things to come.

217
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:50,039
There is now little left to eat
and South Georgia's beaches

218
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,840
will soon be abandoned
to the cold and ice.

219
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,839
Further south still,

220
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:09,080
and the first storms are striking
the continent of Antarctica.

221
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,359
The Adelie penguins must
rear their half grown chicks

222
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:38,200
to adulthood before winter
hits in just a few weeks' time.

223
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,159
The chicks are only three weeks old.

224
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,719
Their downy coats aren't fully
waterproof yet

225
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,800
and they cluster
together for warmth.

226
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,239
These creches are essential
during bad weather

227
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,319
as most of the adults
are away at sea,

228
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,240
fishing for their fast growing
families.

229
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,959
When the parents return,

230
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,400
their offspring quickly leave
the comfort of their peers.

231
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:29,280
Both chicks are ravenously hungry.

232
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,199
But there may only be enough
food for one.

233
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:44,920
This race could determine which
chick has the better prospects.

234
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:07,760
Most Adelie pairs will only manage
to raise a single chick each season.

235
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,960
And this may not be it.

236
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,440
At least number one
is getting stronger by the day.

237
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:34,360
With one meal delivered, the
parents must quickly find another.

238
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,439
To rear their chicks
before the onset of winter,

239
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,080
the penguins must work
round the clock.

240
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,679
The parents can travel
over 100 miles

241
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,919
to reach the best fishing grounds

242
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,000
and may be gone for several days
at a time.

243
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,159
They return with a kilogram of fish
and squid in their bellies,

244
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:35,040
feed their chicks, and then go
off again to repeat the process.

245
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:45,880
The job must be finished before
the sea freezes over again.

246
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:58,399
At seven-weeks-old, the chicks are
losing the last of their baby down,

247
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,799
and are now fully equipped
to take the plunge.

248
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,280
Confidence is all that's lacking.

249
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,040
Perhaps it'll help
if the parents lead by example.

250
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:22,360
There... effortless,
and as graceful as any fish.

251
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:36,720
It seems penguins are not born
with a love of water.

252
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,400
Staying submerged
is the next problem.

253
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,800
Buoyancy control is clearly
a skill that needs practise.

254
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,600
Well, it's a start(!)

255
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,480
And at least they can now reach
the ice floes.

256
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:29,159
Swimming is the first
of many lessons.

257
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:34,240
They must next learn to recognise
danger in all its forms.

258
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,800
A leopard seal.

259
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,760
Even high up on an ice floe,
the penguins aren't safe.

260
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:21,199
Each year, leopard seals
will take 5,000 of them

261
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,040
from this colony alone.

262
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:35,920
The Adelies that survive
drift out into the Southern Ocean.

263
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:56,799
They will spend the next five months
feeding at sea,

264
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,480
avoiding the great freeze
that is about to envelop Antarctica.

265
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:21,520
The edge of the sea ice advances
by up to two and a half miles a day.

266
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,519
Eventually, over 5 million
square miles of ice

267
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,399
will surround the continent
of Antarctica,

268
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,760
effectively doubling its size.

269
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,880
The great white wilderness
is empty.

270
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,680
But not for long.

271
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,639
Bizarrely, it's now that
the Emperor penguins arrive,

272
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,920
just as all the other penguins
have left.

273
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:29,279
These giants are now
at their heaviest.

274
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:34,120
They've been feeding at sea
all summer and can weigh 40 kilos.

275
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,400
From the edge of the sea ice,
they head towards their colony...

276
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,800
but an obstacle course of jumbled
ice blocks stands in their way.

277
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:16,000
The males are particularly fat
at this time of year.

278
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:21,479
This will be crucial for their
survival in the months ahead,

279
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:26,000
but it doesn't make squeezing
through narrow gaps any easier(!)

280
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,919
With the worst behind them,

281
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:09,119
they start a 20 mile march
into the freezer to breed.

282
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:12,400
The only animals to do so.

283
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:26,399
By tobogganing they can travel
at twice their walking speed

284
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,480
and it takes the weight
off tired feet.

285
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:54,679
Their destination is the
thicker ice, closer to shore,

286
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:58,919
which will stay solid long enough
for them to safely rear their chicks

287
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,240
throughout the months to come.

288
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:14,199
Their colony is in the lee of
icebergs trapped in the frozen ocean

289
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,880
which will shelter them
from the bitter Antarctic winds.

290
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:26,320
Newly formed pairs
promenade together.

291
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:49,399
Courtship demands that both partners
strike and hold a variety of poses.

292
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:53,079
It's an important process
as the bond between the couple

293
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:56,080
will have to be an exceptionally
strong one.

294
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:11,799
The final act lacks the elegance
of the prelude

295
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,400
but at least it's quick.

296
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:23,079
The egg is laid a few days later.

297
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:27,119
It contains the female's
last reserves.

298
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,519
She now has nothing more to give

299
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:33,040
and must pass the egg to the male
to incubate.

300
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,079
The couple must be quick.

301
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:44,080
If the egg rests on the ice
for too long it'll freeze.

302
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:51,959
With their eggs
safe in the care of the males,

303
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:56,040
the females start the long journey
back to the sea.

304
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:14,120
The sun is also leaving
and will be gone for many months.

305
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,319
The precious eggs,
balanced on the males' feet,

306
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:24,520
will make the terrible ordeal
ahead worthwhile.

307
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:38,279
With no food
and only each other for warmth,

308
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:41,599
they will attempt to keep
the next generation alive

309
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:45,880
while surviving in the most brutal
conditions on earth.

310
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,440
Not all of them will succeed.

311
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,279
At both ends of our planet,

312
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:02,080
the sun sets for the last time
in autumn.

313
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,079
A season of change comes to an end

314
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:11,640
and one of endless darkness
and bitter cold begins.

315
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,879
Next time, winter in the poles.

316
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,240
The harshest and coldest
conditions on earth.

317
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:48,320
Ice takes a grip
of the frozen planet.

318
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:07,719
The spectacular return
of the Emperor penguins

319
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:10,840
was a key event
for the Frozen Planet team.

320
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,519
The crew will have to operate

321
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,319
in the most dangerous of all
polar environments...

322
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,440
the edge of the sea ice.

323
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:29,679
They have to fly in everything
they'll need for a month

324
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,720
of living on the frozen ocean.

325
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:40,479
On board are slow motion cameraman
John Aitchison.

326
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,479
Underwater cameraman
Didier Noirot.

327
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:46,640
And director Chadden Hunter.

328
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,839
With the plane gone,
the team are on their own.

329
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:54,719
This is home for the next month.

330
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,040
But it doesn't look like much
right now.

331
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:02,479
Their tents should be secure
on the permanent sea ice

332
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,239
but they're still miles from
the ocean where they hope to film.

333
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,519
The locals are keen
to get acquainted

334
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:12,240
with anything
of a familiar shape and size.

335
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:16,439
The Emperors are welcome
neighbours around camp,

336
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,919
but the team need to film them
returning from the water

337
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,759
and to do that
they face a daunting task.

338
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:25,759
They must find a path
to the open sea

339
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:29,360
through a shifting landscape
of jagged sea ice.

340
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,839
Their first scouting trip
doesn't look promising.

341
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:38,360
Neither maps nor Sat Nav help
in this ever-changing environment.

342
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:42,719
The only clue that the ocean
lies somewhere to the east

343
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,520
is a steady procession of penguins.

344
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:49,759
Any suggestions, Didier?
We must find a way.

345
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,719
Yes. And we will find a way.

346
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,799
I like the attitude.
The penguins have found a way.

347
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:01,679
It seems the Emperors will be
the key to reaching the ice edge.

348
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,440
OK, let's go.

349
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,519
With their penguin guides
leading the way,

350
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,799
snowmobiles are brought in
to haul 500kgs of equipment

351
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,920
through the icy maze.

352
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:20,119
It's tough going
for film crew and penguins.

353
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:23,719
When the ice ridges halt progress,

354
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,480
it's time for some
back-breaking work.

355
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:36,519
The next three days are spent
chiselling through mile after mile

356
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,400
of broken sea ice.

357
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:53,839
Once finally clear
of the ice boulders,

358
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:58,800
they spot their goal ... a patch
of open ocean with penguins.

359
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,399
John is first in position.

360
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,679
He hopes to capture
the most striking images

361
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:14,120
by using a computerised
slow motion camera.

362
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,199
But attempts to film the penguins
underwater are halted

363
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,119
by an unwelcome visitor.

364
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:24,439
We just saw the head
of a massive leopard seal

365
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:28,599
so we'll get closer
to see what's going on.

366
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:33,079
We must be careful because those
guys can come out very quickly,

367
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,359
out of the hole, and give a bite,

368
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:39,119
but being red like that, we should
be quite protected, you know?

369
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:44,239
Being dressed in red
may be Didier's idea of safety,

370
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:48,359
but the rest of the crew have
a healthy respect for leopard seals.

371
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:53,399
They can be fiercely territorial
and are not afraid to attack humans.

372
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:58,159
I think I can run faster than him
on land.

373
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,959
That's very exciting.

374
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:03,839
That's the first time I've ever seen
a leopard seal in my life

375
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:06,439
and he's come straight out
of the hole and starts...

376
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,799
walloping towards us.

377
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,759
There's a lot of adrenalin.

378
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,799
With the seal frightening
the penguins away

379
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:18,560
and hassling the crew,
it's time to try a new hole.

380
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,680
Oh, hello.

381
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,680
Can you see him?

382
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:36,719
While the seal's around, there's
little hope of filming the penguins,

383
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,640
but now a far greater threat
is posed by the changing weather.

384
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:44,759
That dark headland in the distance
is Cape Washington.

385
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:48,559
That's our last sign of mainland.
We can't see anything else.

386
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:51,359
Once we lose sight of that mainland

387
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:55,239
that means we're out here
on our own on the sea ice.

388
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:58,079
This visibility
is getting lower and lower.

389
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:01,919
It's started snowing and this wind
is just blowing off shore

390
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,999
so, if all this ice heads out,
we don't want to be on it.

391
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,840
I think we're going to can
filming for the day.

392
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:19,240
All the signs suggest that a
big Antarctic storm is on its way.

393
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:27,680
Winds pick up to 70mph and everyone
retreats to their tents.

394
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,920
High winds then turn to heavy snow.

395
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:39,360
On the driest continent on Earth,
a big snowfall is rare.

396
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:46,600
White-out conditions take the
penguins and film crew by surprise.

397
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:53,079
Each day they must dig out
their buried equipment.

398
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:55,480
Filming has ground to a halt.

399
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:07,399
One week and a metre of snow later,
the headland is visible again

400
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:11,560
and the team are raring
to get back to the ice edge.

401
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:16,359
They follow their old route
back through the frozen maze

402
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,639
and, with no leopard seal in sight,

403
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:22,119
it's time for another attempt
with the pole cam.

404
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:27,079
It's cumbersome, but it allows the
team to capture underwater images

405
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:30,120
without having to risk
the icy water themselves.

406
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:38,079
That is OK? That's perfect.
They are coming. I can see some.

407
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,919
Oh, wow!

408
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:44,039
Penguins coming in the hole.
This is awesome. This is great.

409
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:48,799
The aim now is to film the penguins'
dramatic exit from the hole.

410
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:52,160
The only problem... which hole?!

411
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:03,639
These penguins keep outsmarting us.

412
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:07,239
We tried to switch holes
to film them coming up

413
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:10,519
and they all just completely
came up behind us.

414
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:16,000
Whatever the crew try there's always
someone who hasn't read the script!

415
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:21,999
John has been filming but he
can't view his slow motion shots

416
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,280
until they're downloaded
to a computer.

417
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:29,039
While he waits,
Didier seizes his chance.

418
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,159
Come, my friend. Come.

419
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:34,439
If you can't beat them, join them.

420
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:37,919
It's time to go scuba diving
in the coldest waters on the planet.

421
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,520
I will see you on the other side.

422
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:49,279
The team are 300 miles from help

423
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,880
and have only a small hole
as their lifeline to the surface.

424
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:00,239
A magical world opens up.

425
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:01,919
For the first time

426
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:07,520
Didier now shares the penguins'
perspective from beneath the ice.

427
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:25,680
This is Antarctica
at its most enchanting.

428
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:30,479
For Chadden,
after weeks of struggle,

429
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:34,319
the sequence quite literally
falls into his lap.

430
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,120
Whoa!

431
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:38,640
Sorry!

432
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:42,360
I think I'm in the way.

433
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:51,840
Just come a little this way.
There we go.

434
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:58,200
I'm getting run over by penguins(!)

435
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:03,599
I think it worked.
It's very difficult to tell.

436
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:05,519
John's camera is finally capturing

437
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:10,600
the super slow motion images
of the Emperors' dramatic return.

438
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:16,159
With the penguins performing
perfectly

439
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,319
it was all falling into place.

440
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,399
The team were finally able
to capture

441
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,800
Antarctica's most spectacular
belly flop.

442
