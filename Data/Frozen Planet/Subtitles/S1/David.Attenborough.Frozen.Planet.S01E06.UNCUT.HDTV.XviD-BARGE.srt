1
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,480
The polar regions are more hostile to
life than any other part of the Earth.

2
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:49,520
Human beings have little natural
protection against the cold,

3
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,519
so why, for thousands of years,

4
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,320
have we endured the hardships that
come from living here?

5
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,839
And what keeps us coming back today,

6
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,440
to the farthest extremes
of our planet?

7
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,240
Winter in the most northerly town
on Earth, Longyearbyen.

8
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,920
Here, for three months of the year,
the sun never rises.

9
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,759
Only the full moon, which never
sets as far north as this,

10
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,160
sheds any light into the darkness.

11
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,479
This town was built here in Svalbard,

12
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,800
only 700 miles from the North Pole,
to support a mine.

13
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,760
The Arctic is rich in coal,
oil and minerals.

14
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,180
In Siberia, the Russian
Arctic, the mineral

15
00:02:16,181 --> 00:02:18,560
wealth has given rise
to large cities.

16
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,360
This is Norilsk,
the coldest city on Earth.

17
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:37,279
Temperatures regularly drop
to below minus 50 degrees Centigrade.

18
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,940
Fuel freezes in the tanks
of the trucks, and

19
00:02:39,941 --> 00:02:42,600
has to be melted in a
rather alarming way.

20
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,720
Ships are frozen into the rivers
for nine months of the year.

21
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,159
The ice must be cut
away from their hulls

22
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,760
because steel becomes brittle
and vulnerable to the thickening ice.

23
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,780
Like all Arctic cities,
Norilsk depends on a

24
00:03:07,781 --> 00:03:10,960
power plant which heats
everybody's home.

25
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,199
Waste heat from the plant even keeps
a lake ice-free all winter.

26
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,340
Even at air temperatures
of minus 50, the

27
00:03:20,341 --> 00:03:23,480
Norilsk Walrus Club
come here every day.

28
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,439
There is evidence that a dip in cold
water is good for the immune system,

29
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,319
but when the water is
a degree above freezing,

30
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,120
it's hard to imagine that the
benefits could outweigh the pain.

31
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,300
Today's Arctic city
dwellers can lead an

32
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:10,440
almost normal existence
thanks to technology.

33
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,960
But towns and cities are very recent
arrivals in the polar landscape.

34
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,279
The polar regions are the least
populated part of our planet.

35
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,640
Most of the Arctic remains
empty of human beings.

36
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,200
In the north, the Pole itself is
covered by a freezing ocean.

37
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,400
Around it lie vast lands, of which
Siberia is the largest and coldest.

38
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,759
Human beings first ventured onto
the great plains of Siberia,

39
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,880
the tundra, thousands of years ago,
and some live here still.

40
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,839
The Dolgan are one of the few tribes
who still live in much the same way

41
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,200
as those first Arctic pioneers.

42
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,919
They are reindeer people.

43
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:40,879
Reindeer are one of few animals that can
endure these bitterly cold conditions,

44
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,960
scraping a living by nibbling tiny
plants that survive beneath the snow.

45
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,479
Nobody has ever totally
tamed reindeer,

46
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,239
but today's animals are docile enough
to allow the Dolgan

47
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,440
to drive them across the tundra in an
everlasting search for their food.

48
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:23,720
This is a typical Dolgan village,
home to just two extended families.

49
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,599
Here, in the coldest part of Arctic,
the only way to get water

50
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,520
for nine months of the year is to
melt ice from the frozen rivers.

51
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,679
At least there's no problem
preventing food from decay.

52
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,880
Outside is one big deep-freeze.

53
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,159
Survival is only possible
because of reindeer fur.

54
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,439
It makes wonderfully warm clothing,

55
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,840
though small children still
have to be sewn into

56
00:07:07,841 --> 00:07:10,240
their clothes to prevent
instant frostbite.

57
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,480
The Dolgan even use reindeer fur to
insulate their huts.

58
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,280
This is living at its most communal.

59
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,240
Good relations with the in-laws are
essential.

60
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,320
Reindeer are so valuable
that the people

61
00:07:33,321 --> 00:07:36,119
only eat them if they
have no other choice.

62
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,920
Their favourite food is
raw fish from the frozen rivers.

63
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,740
Every week or so, these
families have to travel

64
00:07:45,741 --> 00:07:48,480
to find new feeding
grounds for their herds.

65
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,359
First, they round up their strongest
animals with lassoes,

66
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,860
a skill that their
ancestors brought with

67
00:07:56,861 --> 00:07:59,360
them when they came north
from Central Asia.

68
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,480
And then, literally, they move house.

69
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,799
A whole Dolgan village can move
on in just a few hours.

70
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,440
Over the year, they travel hundreds of
miles like this across the vast tundra.

71
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,479
It was the herds of reindeer, wandering
over the lands of the Arctic,

72
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,799
that brought the first Dolgan here.

73
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:08,319
Other people, however,
took on an even greater challenge.

74
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,680
They left the land and looked
for their food out on the frozen sea.

75
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:25,080
Here in the shifting world of the sea
ice, they found sea mammals.

76
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,940
Pasha leads a group of
Inuit men in Chukotka,

77
00:10:01,941 --> 00:10:04,640
the North Eastern
corner of Russia.

78
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,239
The men have travelled many
hours from home in the bitter cold,

79
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,600
fighting their way through
a dangerous maze.

80
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:23,160
These hundred tonne ice floes could
crush their small boats like eggshells.

81
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:44,560
The men have big families, and this is
the only way they have of feeding them.

82
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,000
Pasha is looking for the puffs of
steamy air produced by their quarry.

83
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,080
An animal that is bigger than
many Arctic whales.

84
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,480
A two tonne seal with formidable
tusks.

85
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,439
A walrus.

86
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,480
It's heading for open water.
They must reach it before it dives.

87
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,440
An angry walrus could easily
overturn the boats.

88
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,759
The harpoon sticks firmly in the
walrus's thick layer of blubber,

89
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,000
and floats attached to it prevent
the animal from diving.

90
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,600
Pasha wants to kill quickly with
a single clean shot.

91
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,220
The hunters are exhausted
after a long day,

92
00:12:20,221 --> 00:12:23,160
but they still have a
lot more work to do.

93
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,880
This enormous prize will feed
everyone's family for weeks.

94
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,880
It will take many hours to butcher.
Nothing will go to waste.

95
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,760
The meat is parcelled up in bags
made of the animal's skin.

96
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,520
It's midnight, but the sun is still
up.

97
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,480
Summer is almost here.

98
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,079
This far north,
the seasons change fast,

99
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:18,840
the sun is rising higher and
growing warmer with each passing day.

100
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,239
The transformation from winter to
summer is so dramatic

101
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,720
that it dominates the lives of all
who live here.

102
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,799
The ice around the coast has
almost disappeared,

103
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,280
and gone are the seals and walrus
that Pasha and his men relied on.

104
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,560
They set off on
another search for food.

105
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,120
Their destination is
an island in the bay.

106
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,359
Their walrus skin boat is
an ancient design,

107
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,360
light enough to carry high up
the beach so it doesn't drift away.

108
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,360
THEY SPEAK RUSSIAN

109
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,639
Once again, the men will have to work
as a team,

110
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,360
but one of them will be taking
very serious risks.

111
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,919
The lightest man in the group, Kolya,
is also the oldest.

112
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,560
He will trust his life
to a length of old

113
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,200
nylon rope and the
strength of his friends.

114
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,439
These 100 metre high cliffs are home
to thousands of guillemots,

115
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,480
and Kolya is after their eggs.

116
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,600
He relies on the men above to
lower him to the right place.

117
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,519
Kolya is tough
but his stress is obvious.

118
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,120
HE SHOUTS IN RUSSIAN

119
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,279
The men lower Kolya down to
the bottom of the cliff,

120
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,240
and from there, he works his way back
up the crumbling rock face.

121
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,880
Stop!

122
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,639
This mission will produce no more
than about 50 eggs,

123
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,920
but at least there's no need to
carry a packed lunch.

124
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,160
Over the years, many men have fallen to
their deaths collecting seabird eggs.

125
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,560
This is truly dangerous work.

126
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,919
These Arctic peoples can't
grow crops.

127
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:11,159
The frozen ground never thaws to
allow them to do so.

128
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,519
They rely on animals for their food
so the chance to collect a few

129
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,760
dozen eggs has to be taken,
even if it means risking your life.

130
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,159
The change of season has transformed
the Arctic's coastline

131
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,640
and inland, the difference
is just as extreme.

132
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,080
July temperatures on
the tundra can be

133
00:17:51,081 --> 00:17:53,800
surprisingly high, over
30 degrees centigrade.

134
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,279
Reindeer now move not just to
find fresh pasture,

135
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,280
but also to avoid the summer
swarms of blood sucking flies.

136
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,680
To keep their animals healthy, the local
herders are driving them to the sea.

137
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:19,719
The cooler conditions on
the coast bring relief to the herds

138
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,280
and the chance, every year,
for different tribes to meet.

139
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,180
Pasha and his hunters
live close by.

140
00:18:28,181 --> 00:18:30,640
They've had word of
the herders' arrival.

141
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,439
The hunters' cargo is highly
prized for the winter ahead,

142
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,840
fat-rich walrus meat
that's been fermenting

143
00:18:43,841 --> 00:18:46,240
in the skin bags for two months.

144
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,840
Today will see an exchange that has
taken place every summer for centuries.

145
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:58,359
The herders barter reindeer
skins for walrus meat.

146
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:03,920
Pooling their resources has helped these
communities to survive for so long.

147
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:14,160
A fry-up of guillemot eggs is all the
better when shared with old friends.

148
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,999
Summer brings a brief
chance for isolated peoples to meet.

149
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,839
This is an opportunity to exchange
news, arrange weddings,

150
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,799
and tell the latest jokes.

151
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,920
HE SPEAKS RUSSIAN

152
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,639
By August, the summer is over.

153
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,519
Winter arrives only too swiftly,
but the peoples of the Arctic,

154
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,559
who came here originally to hunt,
have devised ways to deal with

155
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,280
the hostile and changing conditions
that have stood the test of time.

156
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,080
Today, there's a new draw to the
Arctic.

157
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,560
This is Greenland, a
territory of Denmark now

158
00:20:08,561 --> 00:20:11,520
known to be rich in oil
and precious metals.

159
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,360
This sled team is
part of the Danish Special Forces.

160
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,759
They're on one of the world's toughest
journeys, a 2,000 mile patrol

161
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,640
to maintain Denmark's
claim to this valuable wilderness.

162
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,180
But the patrol's mission
is only possible with

163
00:20:44,181 --> 00:20:47,160
the help of man's oldest
Arctic companion.

164
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,320
Rasmus and Roland have spent the
summer months training

165
00:20:57,321 --> 00:21:01,079
and getting to know their team of
Greenland huskies.

166
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:05,279
They need to have a very close bond
with every single dog.

167
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,079
This is Roger and Armstrong,

168
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:14,160
actually the oldest dog in the whole
patrol, but he's still going strong.

169
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,799
The men are totally dependent on
the stamina of their dogs,

170
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:25,400
which will keep on running all through
the bitter cold of the winter.

171
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:35,200
This is the last time the team will
see the sun for two months.

172
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,839
The most intelligent dogs
always lead,

173
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,080
choosing the safest route, feeling
for hidden crevasses and thin ice.

174
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,199
This is one of six teams that patrol
the whole of northeast Greenland,

175
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,980
the only people in an
empty wilderness that is

176
00:22:04,981 --> 00:22:07,760
larger than France and
Great Britain combined.

177
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,359
Conditions here are too extreme
for current mining technology,

178
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:20,319
but some day, ways will be found of
digging out the huge mineral treasures

179
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,560
that lie hidden within these
mountains.

180
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:31,080
The patrol secures Denmark's claim to
do so simply by being here.

181
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,880
But it's not the
prospect of getting rich

182
00:22:44,881 --> 00:22:47,279
that makes men sign
up for this patrol,

183
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,720
it's the chance for the journey of a
lifetime.

184
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,540
The team travel over
the ice for six

185
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:56,320
months, covering up
to 40 miles in a day.

186
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,760
Friendship and teamwork are essential
if they're to succeed.

187
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,399
Their dogs can sleep outside no
matter how cold it gets.

188
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,800
Rasmus and Roland have a
nice cosy tent.

189
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:21,359
They have a few modern conveniences,
including a radio,

190
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,679
with which they report their position
back to headquarters in Denmark

191
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,720
and catch up on the latest news.

192
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,759
Right now it's the section of money,

193
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,519
what's new in the economy in
Denmark, the financial crisis

194
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:42,000
and all the other things that we
actually don't care about out here.

195
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,960
If you can cope with
the conditions, then

196
00:23:45,961 --> 00:23:48,439
winter in the Arctic
can be magical,

197
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,640
especially when the greatest
light show on Earth is overhead.

198
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,959
The first humans in the Arctic
believed the Northern Lights,

199
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,799
or aurora borealis,
were dancing spirits.

200
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,740
Now we know the lights are
caused by electrically

201
00:24:12,741 --> 00:24:15,679
charged particles
streaming from the sun,

202
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,040
attracted by the magnetic
pull of the earth's poles.

203
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,239
A big aurora storm contains enough
energy to knock out satellite

204
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,639
communications and power supplies
across the northern hemisphere,

205
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,000
so understanding the aurora
is vital.

206
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,160
In Alaska,
rockets are used to study the Lights.

207
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:59,159
A hundred miles up, at the edge
of outer space, the rockets

208
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,800
release a cloud of glowing smoke
that's visible from earth.

209
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:12,160
The smoke is blown by fierce winds
which are generated by the aurora.

210
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,919
Mapping the movement of the smoke
helps scientists to understand

211
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,800
how this unearthly spectacle
affects our atmosphere.

212
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:49,879
They constantly monitor
the aurora to help protect us

213
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,039
from its effects, so the rest of us
can simply enjoy the magic,

214
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:57,000
just as the Arctic's first people must
have done, thousands of years ago.

215
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,599
For all the many
peoples of the Arctic,

216
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,240
the aurora is a
reminder of the sun's

217
00:26:18,241 --> 00:26:20,880
presence throughout the
dark days of winter.

218
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,399
But when the sun
is below the horizon in the north,

219
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,200
it's above it at the southern
end of our planet.

220
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,240
Here, humanity's history has
been very different.

221
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,399
Antarctica is far colder
than the Arctic,

222
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,120
and 99% of its land is permanently
blanketed by ice.

223
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,439
Antarctica is so utterly remote

224
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,120
and inhospitable that no people
ever settled here.

225
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:06,279
It was only 200 years ago that the
first human beings

226
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,800
even glimpsed the vast continent.

227
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,719
The first people who crossed
the Southern Ocean did

228
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,719
so for the same reason that the first
people went to the Arctic Ocean,

229
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,040
to hunt sea mammals.

230
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:42,719
The populations of whales
and seals are only now beginning to

231
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,360
recover from 150 years
of intensive hunting.

232
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,580
But none of those hunters
ever tried to venture into

233
00:28:04,581 --> 00:28:07,440
the frigid interior of
the Antarctic continent.

234
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,600
The first successful attempt to do that
was made only a hundred years ago.

235
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,400
This hut was the base
for one of the most

236
00:28:19,401 --> 00:28:22,000
famous expeditions
in polar history.

237
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:33,319
It was from here in 1911 that
Captain Scott and his team

238
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:37,760
launched their attempt to be the
first people to reach the South Pole.

239
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,799
The cold, dry conditions have
preserved the interior

240
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:49,280
of the hut almost exactly
as the expedition members left it.

241
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,800
Expedition photographer
Herbert Ponting

242
00:28:57,801 --> 00:29:00,680
captured the spirit of
the age of exploration.

243
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:10,280
These first explorers borrowed
the techniques of the Arctic peoples.

244
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:16,840
They wore fur gloves and boots
and burned seal blubber to keep warm.

245
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:23,200
They built sleds based on a
traditional Inuit design.

246
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,880
They even made their sleeping
bags from reindeer hide.

247
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,639
Scott and his men sought the glory of
discovery in an untouched wilderness,

248
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,319
and died in the attempt.

249
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:51,079
But he, and those who followed him,
were the first to reveal

250
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,240
the splendour of Antarctica to
the rest of the world.

251
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,679
The lure of adventure still draws
intrepid travellers today.

252
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,159
Like the first explorers,

253
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:14,279
most modern visitors come during the
brief summer when the cold relents

254
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:19,599
enough for the toughest icebreakers
to reach the edge of the continent,

255
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,080
but most still need
a helicopter to go further.

256
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,079
The scenery in Antarctica is
magnificent and dramatic,

257
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:39,120
but what really attracts people
here is the wildlife.

258
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,360
An emperor penguin colony is
a particular highlight.

259
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,000
Because human beings
didn't arrive in the

260
00:30:51,001 --> 00:30:53,279
Antarctic until the
past few centuries,

261
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,880
the animals have never
developed a fear of man.

262
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:04,880
But very strict regulations govern how
close people can approach any wildlife.

263
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,960
And when visitors
leave, they must take

264
00:31:08,961 --> 00:31:11,160
every trace of their
visit away with them.

265
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,480
Since 1959, the whole of Antarctica has
been protected by international treaty.

266
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:50,639
The nations of the world have agreed
that no country can claim Antarctica,

267
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,800
or prospect for its oil or minerals.

268
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:59,679
The only significant human activities
allowed here are those that

269
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,440
extend our scientific knowledge.

270
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,280
But unlocking Antarctica's secrets
requires some unusual tools.

271
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:32,399
This brand new robot submarine has
been designed to go

272
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,960
far beyond the limits of any human.

273
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,220
Today, this diver is
putting the sub through

274
00:32:50,221 --> 00:32:53,040
its paces on one of
its very first dives.

275
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:58,079
It's designed to be small
and nimble enough

276
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,040
to explore the Antarctic seabed
without damaging it.

277
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:20,759
The submarine's mission, as it
journeys into the unknown,

278
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:24,120
is to map the seafloor and look for
species new to science.

279
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,580
The seawater here is a
degree below zero, so even

280
00:33:42,581 --> 00:33:45,480
the toughest human diver
can't stay down for long.

281
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:54,200
The submarine will explore deeper under
the ice than anyone has gone before.

282
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:03,799
From the depths of the ocean to
the highest peaks of the land,

283
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,580
new discoveries are being
made even in places

284
00:34:06,581 --> 00:34:09,360
which were first visited
over a century ago.

285
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,580
Mount Erebus was an
irresistible draw to

286
00:34:24,581 --> 00:34:27,360
the legendary explorer
Ernest Shackleton.

287
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:34,039
In 1908, his men became the first to
climb this active volcano.

288
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:38,840
They soon discovered that this is the
coldest place on the Antarctic coast.

289
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,960
Today's explorers
still have to guard

290
00:34:41,961 --> 00:34:44,079
against frostbite in
the height of summer

291
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:47,760
when temperatures rarely creep
above minus 30 degrees centigrade.

292
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:58,519
Shackleton's men had no idea
of the extraordinary spectacle

293
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,840
that lay beneath their feet.

294
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,919
Yep, OK, up on the wall there
somewhere now. Yeah.

295
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,359
Under the ice and snow is a network
of caves,

296
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:17,320
which only a handful of expert cavers
have ever dared to enter.

297
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,880
This is the first scientific
expedition to explore them in detail.

298
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:39,040
Here, there are ice formations that
occur nowhere else on Earth.

299
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,960
Each cave contains its own unique
collection of structures.

300
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:19,239
The team is mapping the caves to see how
their shape changes over the years.

301
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,840
OK, flat side to here.

302
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,039
That's 126.8 degrees for the angle.

303
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,599
126.8. Correct.

304
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:41,199
The steam leaking from vents
in the side of the volcano

305
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,480
is constantly sculpting this labyrinth
that extends deep under the ice.

306
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:51,239
When the hot breath of the volcano
hits the icy walls,

307
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,960
the moisture in the air
freezes into beautiful shapes.

308
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:13,199
Some of the crystals are so unusual
that the cavers are investigating

309
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,680
a remote but tantalising
possibility about their formation.

310
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,519
Could it be that some of these
extraordinary crystal shapes

311
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:27,320
are formed by highly specialised
bacteria, living in the ice?

312
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,439
Nobody yet knows the answer.

313
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,279
This is just one of the many strange
mysteries that draw people to

314
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,440
work in a place that is
so hostile to human life.

315
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,839
While some scientists come to Erebus
to explore its bizarre ice caves,

316
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:10,120
others visit the volcano to study
the innermost workings of our planet.

317
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,799
Erebus is one of the most active
volcanoes on Earth,

318
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:24,400
but even so, volcanologists work on
the very rim of its crater.

319
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:30,879
They stand in the bitter cold,
while 100 metres below them

320
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,360
is a lava lake where temperatures are
over a thousand degrees centigrade.

321
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,080
This is a rare glimpse
of the molten rock

322
00:38:41,081 --> 00:38:43,960
that lies beneath
the earth's crust.

323
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,119
But research here is looking
up as well as down,

324
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:05,759
measuring how the gases that bubble
out of the volcano

325
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,800
influence the make-up of the air we
breathe.

326
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:17,319
Antarctica is the best place to
measure any changes in our atmosphere

327
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,880
because it has the least polluted air
on Earth.

328
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:27,080
It's also the perfect place to launch
more outward-looking missions.

329
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:37,399
This balloon, made of material no
thicker than Clingfilm,

330
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,400
will eventually grow to
be 300 metres tall.

331
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,399
It will carry a device for detecting
cosmic rays,

332
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:52,600
tiny particles from the beginning of
time that are only now reaching earth.

333
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:08,439
The balloon will travel to the very
edge of outer space

334
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,520
to gather clues about the formation
of the universe.

335
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:25,960
Even today, very few ever make
the journey inland from the coast.

336
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:31,600
We still know remarkably little
about the interior of the continent.

337
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,519
The people on this plane are trying to
answer one of the fundamental questions.

338
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,880
How much ice is there in Antarctica?

339
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,839
They measure
the depth of the ice sheet,

340
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:53,840
which is over 4,000 metres in places,
using radar.

341
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,799
Their work will enable us to see

342
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,080
how the volume of Antarctica's ice
changes in the future.

343
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,800
It also makes it possible to map
a hidden landscape.

344
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:25,799
This plane is following the same route
through the Trans-Antarctic Mountains

345
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,919
that Captain Scott took a hundred
years ago.

346
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,700
His team hauled their
sleds over a hundred

347
00:41:31,701 --> 00:41:34,480
miles up this glacier,
the Beardmore.

348
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,839
Skirting seemingly endless crevasses,
with no map to guide them

349
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:50,840
and no idea of what lay ahead, it was
a journey of extraordinary suffering.

350
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,319
Their target lay beyond the
mountains,

351
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:09,680
over 3,000 metres above sea level,
on the Antarctic Plateau.

352
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,919
An unbroken sheet of ice,
larger than Western Europe,

353
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,520
this is the coldest, the windiest,
the most lifeless place on Earth.

354
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:33,759
Roald Amundsen's team narrowly
defeated Scott's to become

355
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:40,000
the first people to reach the South
Pole on the 14th of December 1911.

356
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:46,760
Nobody else successfully completed the
journey for nearly 50 years after that.

357
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,599
But, since 1957, there has been
a permanent base at the South Pole.

358
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,240
You can even land a plane on
the ice runway.

359
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,260
The early explorers
would be astounded by

360
00:43:04,261 --> 00:43:07,080
the facilities at the
South Pole today.

361
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:13,200
Construction work isn't
easy when the average

362
00:43:13,201 --> 00:43:16,040
summer temperature is minus
25 degrees Centigrade.

363
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,919
But, despite the difficulties, the
most high-tech scientific research

364
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:25,320
station ever built was
unveiled here in 2006.

365
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:35,359
The brand new Amundsen-Scott South
Pole Station is designed to

366
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:39,519
cope with the World's most
extreme conditions.

367
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:44,879
The building's sloping edge deflects
the prevailing wind.

368
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,439
Beneath, there are stilts that can
raise the whole building

369
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,480
a further eight metres to keep
it above the accumulating snow.

370
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:05,959
Living inside is as close to being on a
space-station as you can find on Earth.

371
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:10,439
This base is totally self-sufficient,
the people are completely

372
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:15,000
cut off from the outside world for
more than half the year over winter.

373
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:26,520
The total darkness makes this the
perfect place to study the night sky.

374
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:38,599
The group of star gazers will be
the most isolated community on our

375
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,920
planet, but they will have
all their needs catered for.

376
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,679
There is even a greenhouse where
fresh vegetables grow under

377
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:56,360
artificial light all through
the darkest, coldest winter anywhere.

378
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:17,920
The sun sets in March at the South Pole,
and won't rise again for six months.

379
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:28,999
For a few days at this time of year,
high altitude clouds of ice crystals

380
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,380
continue to catch the
sunlight, even when

381
00:45:31,381 --> 00:45:33,760
the sun itself is far
below the horizon.

382
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:54,559
But soon all trace of the sun
disappears,

383
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:59,760
and today's over-wintering scientists
remember the first explorers.

384
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:08,159
These men, who endured
the winter in flimsy wooden huts,

385
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:12,559
borrowed knowledge from the Arctic
pioneers before them,

386
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:18,279
but they came here to study and explore,
rather than to hunt or exploit.

387
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:23,280
They embodied the human spirit that has
enabled us to survive at the poles.

388
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,799
Here, we are pushed to our limits,
but in being pushed, humanity has

389
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:38,400
achieved the extraordinary
and opened up the last frontier.

390
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,320
Next time, I'll be travelling to
the ends of the earth,

391
00:46:51,321 --> 00:46:53,941
to witness for myself
how rising temperatures

392
00:46:53,942 --> 00:46:56,560
are dramatically changing
the Frozen Planet.

393
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:07,039
I'll see how the animals are coping
with their changing world

394
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,640
and find out how these changes might
even affect the whole planet.

395
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:28,639
To tell the story of how we survive
at the Poles, Frozen Planet

396
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,239
travelled to Siberia,
the far north of Russia,

397
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:34,800
where most of the Arctic's
people live.

398
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,120
The team got to know many
extraordinary people.

399
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,839
But one group of men above all really
opened their eyes to what it means

400
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:51,440
to live off the land in the most
unforgiving environment on earth.

401
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:57,480
Men who take their life in their hands
everyday, just to find their food.

402
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,480
Producer, Dan Rees,
led the Frozen Planet

403
00:48:12,481 --> 00:48:15,240
team on their longest
journey in the Arctic.

404
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,780
Their mission was to
film walrus hunters

405
00:48:19,781 --> 00:48:22,399
in Russia's most remote
region, Chukotka,

406
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,759
the closest point to their old enemy
the United States,

407
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,560
4,000 miles and nine time zones east
of Moscow.

408
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,599
It's still a sensitive region,

409
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,920
and the team soon learn
that the border guards

410
00:48:35,921 --> 00:48:38,239
remain twitchy about
foreigners with cameras.

411
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,400
GUARD: Nyet! Nyet!

412
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:49,159
To get permission to film, the crew
relied on anthropologist Niobe Thompson,

413
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:52,400
one of the few westerners
to have worked with the people here.

414
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,400
But even Niobe finds
a lot of doors closed to him.

415
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:06,359
I have experienced a level of red
tape I never could have anticipated.

416
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,119
We've got our Russian
visas in our passports,

417
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:11,799
that's fine,
but that's just the beginning.

418
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:15,599
Here is the special permission
given by the security services to

419
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:18,479
be in the region of Chukotka,

420
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,380
a special permission to
be in every one of the

421
00:49:21,381 --> 00:49:24,279
population centres we
will visit on our trip,

422
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:28,639
permission to shoot with a
telephoto lens,

423
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:33,639
permission to shoot from a
helicopter,

424
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:37,639
permission to shoot in
a natural reserve,

425
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:40,159
but we still don't have our
migration cards.

426
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,439
I'm trying to get them, and if we
don't get them by the end of the day

427
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,620
we're going to be
deported back to Alaska,

428
00:49:45,621 --> 00:49:47,799
it'll take three months
to get new ones.

429
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:50,039
Niobe's paper chase takes two days,

430
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:54,639
but finally the team is allowed to begin
their journey to the hunters' camp.

431
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,919
With no roads, sometimes the only
passable route is over

432
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,120
the fast melting
surfaces of the lakes.

433
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,760
OK?

434
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:19,640
They need to be
prepared for a quick exit.

435
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:31,399
The next day the crew finally
reach the coast.

436
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,960
The hunting camp is now
just 30 miles away

437
00:50:33,961 --> 00:50:36,519
across a bay, but the
crossing could be risky.

438
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:41,320
The frozen sea is melting
fast in the spring sunshine.

439
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:49,679
Confident it's safe? It's not going
to break underneath us?

440
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,519
Is that the decision, 50/50?

441
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,639
50/50!

442
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,999
The locals employ several generations
of arctic transport,

443
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,600
from the ancient to the merely
antique.

444
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:09,479
With the sea ice cracking up beneath
them, Dan has to trust the crew

445
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:13,040
and a ton of filming gear to
the experience of the locals.

446
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:18,040
Even by their standards this was
fast becoming a risky journey.

447
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,600
Where the first sleds crossed just
minutes before is now impassable.

448
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,599
It's broken right up, we can't cross
the leads in the ice here,

449
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,840
so we need to get on some
boats, and the ice is

450
00:51:38,841 --> 00:51:41,079
just breaking up too fast
for us at the moment.

451
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:44,799
Fortunately, the hunters from the
camp turn up in the nick of time

452
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:48,760
to rescue the crew for the final leg
of the journey.

453
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:01,879
Six days and 5,000 miles from home,

454
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:04,280
the crew finally arrive
at the place that

455
00:52:04,281 --> 00:52:06,680
will be their home
for the next month.

456
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:16,999
This is an active hunting camp
and, that evening, the team

457
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,880
are introduced to the realities of
fending for yourself in the Arctic.

458
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,879
Well, we've just seen a walrus hunt

459
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:29,719
out here in the waters
of the Bering Sea.

460
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,680
All the meat will be
eaten, they eat an

461
00:52:31,681 --> 00:52:33,639
awful lot of the
internal organs as well,

462
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:36,159
they use the skin,
they use the sinews,

463
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:40,919
they use the stomach for making drums,
so it'll get used very heavily

464
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:46,240
and it is completely free range,
you know, wild caught animal.

465
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:52,919
You can't grow any vegetables up
here, but sea mammal meat contains

466
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:57,399
all the nutrients the hunters need
and is very low in cholesterol.

467
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:00,319
Dan is keen to try
some of Kolya's health food.

468
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:05,319
Well, this is yesterday's seal
and a chunk of flesh there,

469
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,879
behind it is some intestine.

470
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:10,119
We should try a bit.

471
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,800
That's seal intestine.

472
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:19,799
It's quite fishy.
Fishy, fishy rubber.

473
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,900
That's not too bad.
I thought it was going

474
00:53:21,901 --> 00:53:23,999
to be more disgusting
than it actually is.

475
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,399
The salt helps. Yeah.

476
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:30,879
Would he like to try what we eat?
It's chicken, chicken korma.

477
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,839
No?

478
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:36,800
I don't blame you to be honest,
yours is much better!

479
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:48,719
As well as providing food, the animals
here traditionally provided transport.

480
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:51,999
Kolya and Pasha, the oldest hunters,

481
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,039
keep alive the skill
of building walrus skin boats.

482
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,639
You don't need a welding torch to
repair this boat,

483
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:01,440
just a juicy lump of seal fat to bung
any holes.

484
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:08,279
By living amongst them, the crew had
really begun to get to know the hunters,

485
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:11,800
but there was one big part of their
lives which remained a mystery.

486
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:18,140
As spring turns to
summer, the hunters head

487
00:54:18,141 --> 00:54:20,959
out to an island to
gather seabird eggs.

488
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,600
The crew had heard
stories of this, but had

489
00:54:23,601 --> 00:54:26,240
little idea of what it
was going to involve.

490
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:32,239
That's where they climb,
those are impressive heights.

491
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,480
Quite something.

492
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,700
For cameraman Ted Giffords,
this was the first

493
00:54:40,701 --> 00:54:43,400
sight of the rock face
he was about to work on.

494
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:50,200
These cliffs can be
treacherous, as Kolya, the

495
00:54:50,201 --> 00:54:52,840
expert egg collector,
knows only too well.

496
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:22,760
Ted will rely on steel
stakes for anchors

497
00:55:22,761 --> 00:55:25,680
and an array of climbing
gear and ropes.

498
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,860
Kolya preferred to
stick with the simpler

499
00:55:29,861 --> 00:55:32,720
method that has served
him well for many years.

500
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:42,240
The crew can't quite believe what
they're seeing.

501
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:53,439
If he fell on that that would be
absolutely horrendous.

502
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:58,039
It's... yeah, it's a bit sketchy, and
the rope is only about that thick.

503
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,960
It's an interesting method.

504
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:03,740
The limestone cliff is loose
and crumbling, because

505
00:56:03,741 --> 00:56:06,320
of hundreds of years of
freezing and thawing.

506
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,100
Even for a highly
trained professional

507
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:13,600
climber like Ted, it's
a dangerous descent.

508
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:28,199
Kolya has been climbing here for four
decades, but this is the first time

509
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:31,840
he's had company, and sometimes he
forgets that Ted is just below him.

510
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:39,279
Climbing supervisor Adam Scott
holds his breath as he watches.

511
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:44,120
A fall to the rocks 100 metres below
would almost certainly be fatal.

512
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:57,800
This is the most hardcore
thing I've ever seen.

513
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:05,279
It was when the team returned
to the boat to finish filming

514
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,800
that they got their most
spectacular view of the

515
00:57:07,801 --> 00:57:10,320
lengths Kolya was going
to to get his dinner.

516
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:19,839
This shot sent the team home with
a fresh perspective and a deep

517
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:25,079
respect for these people who still
live off the land in the Arctic.

518
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:28,160
A way of life for which there
is no safety net.

519
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:01,800
