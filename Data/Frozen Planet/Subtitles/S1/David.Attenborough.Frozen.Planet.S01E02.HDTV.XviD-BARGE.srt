1
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,639
The sun is absent for up to
half the year in the polar regions.

2
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,279
When it returns,
at the beginning of spring,

3
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,280
its warmth will transform
this magical ice world.

4
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,680
The greatest seasonal change
on our planet is now underway.

5
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:22,519
Antarctica is still locked in ice,
and surrounded by a frozen ocean.

6
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,960
Nonetheless,
there are signs of spring.

7
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,519
Adelie penguins are arriving ...
just the males.

8
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,679
They've spent five months at sea,
where it's warmer than it is on land

9
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,640
and now they're in a hurry,
for spring will be short.

10
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,399
They have travelled 6,000 miles
across the ocean

11
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,639
since leaving their colony
last year,

12
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,759
and now
they're returning to breed.

13
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,959
They cannot lay their eggs on ice,
for they would freeze,

14
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,880
so they have to come here,
where there is bare rock.

15
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,439
Over the coming months,

16
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,239
the few parts of Antarctica
that are ice-free

17
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,999
will be the stage
on which five million Adelies

18
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,960
will build their nests.

19
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,319
To construct one, they need pebbles,
and without a good-looking nest,

20
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,199
a male will be unable
to attract a female,

21
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,359
when they at last arrive.

22
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,440
An impressive property
demonstrates your worth as a mate.

23
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,879
It takes stones of all shapes
and sizes to build a decent nest,

24
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,240
and finding ones
that are just right is not easy.

25
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,360
So some penguins
turn to a life of crime.

26
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,399
The one who has been robbed
seems unaware

27
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,600
that the thief is just over
his shoulder, and looking for more.

28
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,359
The thief's nest
is coming along nicely,

29
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,559
probably because he keeps
a particularly sharp lookout

30
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,719
for robbers...

31
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,320
after all,
it takes one to know one.

32
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,599
It's still cold,
but the early season sun

33
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,639
does lift the temperature
by a few degrees.

34
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:28,600
That, however, can have unexpected,
even dangerous consequences.

35
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,399
The sea is heating faster
than the land,

36
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,680
pulling cold air from the middle
of the continent towards the coast.

37
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,879
These katabatic winds
are stronger than any hurricane.

38
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,760
They are the coldest and
the most ferocious on the planet.

39
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,279
The storms catch
many new arrivals by surprise,

40
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,080
and are the reason that spring here
is, in fact, the deadliest season.

41
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,320
Here, early birds take a great risk.

42
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,759
Some years,
entire colonies are lost,

43
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,719
buried beneath the snow.

44
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,239
The survivors of this storm

45
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,959
must hope that the females
prove to be worth the wait

46
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,360
when they finally decide to turn up.

47
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,160
Spring in the north of our planet.

48
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,239
The sun, after an absence
of six months,

49
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,880
breaks the horizon
for the first time.

50
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:29,399
A female polar bear emerges
from her den beneath the snow.

51
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,040
The sun must be a welcome relief
after so long in the darkness.

52
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,799
Her den is on a high slope,

53
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,399
well away from hungry male bears
who would kill her cubs,

54
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,079
but close enough to the sea ice
where she can find food

55
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,440
for her extraordinary new family...

56
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,680
three young cubs.

57
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,239
If she can raise them all
to independence,

58
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,000
it'll be a rare achievement.

59
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,759
One of the cubs is underweight,

60
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:39,080
and will be fortunate
to survive these early weeks.

61
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:59,479
If the family reaches the sea ice,
where the female can catch seals,

62
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,239
her milk will be enriched,

63
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,840
and the smaller cub will
quickly gain size and strength.

64
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,080
The sea ice, though,
is a dangerous place.

65
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,959
The male polar bear has been out
on the frozen ocean all winter.

66
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,999
Times have been lean,

67
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,239
and a bear cub would certainly
make a welcome snack.

68
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,279
However, the mainstay
of his diet is seals,

69
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,280
and now is the time
when they have their pups.

70
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,959
The surface of the frozen sea
is marked with pressure ridges,

71
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,040
and cracks created
by the fluctuating tides.

72
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,480
Both are good places
to look for seals.

73
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,920
He has detected a seal den
beneath the ice.

74
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,120
Now he must pin-point it, using only
his extraordinary sense of smell.

75
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,200
By treading lightly,
he can avoid scaring his prey.

76
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,879
He will need to punch through
a metre of snow to reach the den,

77
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,919
and if his aim
is not exactly on target,

78
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,120
the seal will certainly escape.

79
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,679
In fact, the ringed seal
abandoned her den

80
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,679
just a few hours ago

81
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,519
and her pup has climbed up
onto the surface.

82
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:22,720
It's more exposed up here, but it's
easier to see an approaching bear.

83
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,319
The pup is well camouflaged.

84
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,680
Difficult to see when its mother
has left it to go fishing.

85
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,080
But he can still smell it.

86
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,720
Nine out of ten polar bear hunts
end in failure.

87
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,119
The sun's warming effect
on the Arctic is increasing

88
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,840
and the sea ice is showing
the first signs of weakening.

89
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,360
Inland, the northern rivers
are still locked in ice.

90
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,559
The frozen waterfalls are like dams

91
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,599
holding back billions of tonnes
of fresh water

92
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,360
that has not moved
for almost six months.

93
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,879
The vast water shed lies motionless,

94
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:08,280
but as spring advances,
it beings to stir.

95
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,959
The frozen waterfalls
start to weaken.

96
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,760
Above them,
the pressure is mounting.

97
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:29,360
Now, from high above, whole sections
can be seen to be on the move.

98
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,799
The waterfalls are straining
to hold back the force

99
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,920
that is building up above them.

100
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,399
The dam bursts...

101
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,520
and the river is unleashed.

102
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,079
Millions of tonnes of ice
grind their way downstream,

103
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:32,120
driven by the unstoppable force
of the meltwater.

104
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,280
Boulders and trees are plucked
from the bank side.

105
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,519
Within just a few days, the rivers
of the north are all running.

106
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:55,360
The Arctic's fresh water
is flowing again.

107
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,559
These vast floods contain
10% of the world's fresh water

108
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,839
and as they enter the ocean,
they accelerate the break-up.

109
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,399
Soon, an area of sea ice
the size of Australia

110
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,800
will vanish from the Arctic Ocean.

111
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,160
As the huge ice-sheet breaks up,
wildlife returns to the North.

112
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,439
The polar bear mother has made it
to the edge of the sea-ice,

113
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,440
but the smallest cub
is nowhere to be seen.

114
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,279
It's a sad outcome,

115
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,519
but the disappearance improves
the chances of the remaining two,

116
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,840
who now have more milk to share.

117
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,839
Having led her cubs
to the edge of the ice,

118
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,160
the mother's next challenge
is to catch a seal.

119
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,000
Not easy with these two in tow!

120
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,040
CUB GRUNTS

121
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,759
Her prey beneath the ice
can detect the slightest vibration,

122
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,759
especially from bears.

123
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,639
And this is not
the stealthiest of hunting parties.

124
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,000
BEAR GROWLS

125
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,399
Leaving her cubs behind however,
is not an option...

126
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,560
a male bear would eat one
in a moment.

127
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,640
This is not going to be easy.

128
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:25,799
It seems that the cubs already
see themselves as fearsome hunters,

129
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:31,199
but they're still young enough
to accept their mother's discipline.

130
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,280
It's the naughty corner for you!

131
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,079
This is not going to be
their lucky morning.

132
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:01,519
They saw no sign of a seal
and the cubs are hungry again.

133
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:06,079
The mother has been nursing for four
months without once eating herself,

134
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,160
and now her milk is drying up.

135
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,960
She must catch a seal soon,
or the whole family will starve.

136
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,919
The challenge of finding food
is getting harder.

137
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,919
She needs the sea-ice
as a platform from which to hunt

138
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,320
and it's breaking up faster
with each passing day.

139
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:35,240
Even the ice around the coast
is starting to break.

140
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
The first cracks here
are eagerly awaited by some...

141
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,760
narwhals.

142
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,599
The unicorns of the North
are on a mission...

143
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,319
to reach the new fishing grounds

144
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,480
in the bays that have been frozen-up
all winter, but are now opening up.

145
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,759
To get to them, the narwhals
must travel down leads...

146
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,919
temporary cracks in the ice.

147
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:26,439
But these new roads
could close at any time,

148
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,800
cutting off the air
that they need to breathe.

149
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:37,839
The road narrows until there's
barely room for one-way traffic.

150
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,919
Then, a surprise...

151
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,360
narwhals coming
from the other direction.

152
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,919
It's a stand-off.

153
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,520
Each team faces an armoury
of sharp tusks.

154
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,559
Finally, one side concedes

155
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:18,120
and everyone continues
in the same direction.

156
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,999
Within a week, the remaining bays
break wide open,

157
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,560
and the narwhals turn
their attention to social matters.

158
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,679
No-one knows exactly what
the narwhal's tusk is for.

159
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,839
Some say it's used for fencing,

160
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,640
yet these exchanges are too gentle
to be real fights.

161
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,799
Perhaps these encounters

162
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:14,040
are to remind each animal of
where it stands in Narwhal society.

163
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,480
We may never know.

164
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,160
Bizarre creatures appear
as if from nowhere.

165
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:42,199
The tiny plankton they eat have been
fuelled by the increasing warmth

166
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,599
of the sun
and fertilised by the nutrients

167
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,600
brought down by the great rivers and
released from the melting sea-ice.

168
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,079
Sea gooseberries strain the water
with their stinging filaments,

169
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,759
their beating cilia
scatter the sun's rays

170
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,720
into dazzling bursts of colour.

171
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,279
Beneath the breaking sea ice,
a predatory sea slug

172
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:16,159
flies through the water
on translucent wings.

173
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,520
It's on the trail
of a peculiar swimming snail.

174
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,479
And now the most voracious
of the plankton-eaters

175
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,519
swim up from the depths...

176
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,640
Arctic cod.

177
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,359
SEAGULLS CRY

178
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:51,519
The shoals can be enormous,
some containing 500 million fish

179
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,240
and predators travel hundreds
of miles to feast on them.

180
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,559
The cod harvest is THE annual event

181
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,920
for the birds and seals
of the far North.

182
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,399
For just a short period,

183
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,319
the combination of the strengthening
sun, the newly-flowing rivers

184
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:19,960
and the breaking sea ice make
the Arctic Ocean teem with life.

185
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,760
The land is also transformed
by the sun's heat.

186
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:37,279
The small patches of bare ground
that appear are darker than the snow

187
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,200
so they absorb more
of the sun's energy.

188
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,160
This accelerates the melt.

189
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,360
The Arctic tundra is unveiled.

190
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:08,279
By tracking the sun, Arctic poppies
catch its rays around the clock,

191
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:12,600
so their flowers are always warmer
than their surroundings.

192
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:23,159
For early season insects,
this warmth is even more valuable

193
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,320
than nectar if they're
to stay active in the cold.

194
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,039
The woolly bear caterpillar does not
need the warmth from flowers

195
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,679
to kick-start its spring.

196
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,879
It's always the first insect
to appear after the snow retreats

197
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,720
and the story of how it does so
is truly astonishing.

198
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:57,599
At the start of spring, the
caterpillar eats as fast as it can,

199
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,640
as indeed it must, for this far
north, the season will be brief.

200
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,999
The days shorten only too soon,
but the caterpillar has not yet

201
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,759
got enough reserves
to transform itself into a moth.

202
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,799
It can't leave the Arctic,
for it can't fly,

203
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,880
so it settles down beneath a rock.

204
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,080
The sun's warmth rapidly dwindles.

205
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,239
Beneath the rock, the caterpillar
is out of the wind,

206
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,320
but the cold penetrates
deep into the ground.

207
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,519
Soon, its heart stops beating.

208
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,839
It ceases to breathe,
and its body starts to freeze...

209
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,760
first its gut, then its blood.

210
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,399
Spring.

211
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:19,720
After four months of darkness,
the Arctic begins to thaw.

212
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,200
And the caterpillar
rises from the dead.

213
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,199
By the time the first shoots
of willow appear

214
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,040
in the early spring, the woolly bear
is already eating.

215
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,399
But no matter how fast the woolly
bear eats, it will not have time

216
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,839
to gather enough food
this year, either,

217
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,400
and the cold closes in once again.

218
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,599
Year after year, the caterpillar
slows down in the autumn

219
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,240
and then freezes solid.

220
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,160
But eventually,
a very special spring arrives.

221
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,240
This one will be its last.

222
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:49,199
It's now 14 years old ...
the world's oldest caterpillar.

223
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,319
Its remaining days
now become frantic.

224
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,400
It starts to weave a silk cocoon.

225
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:03,559
Inside, its body is changing
into one that can fly and search,

226
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:07,800
abilities that will be crucial
in the days ahead.

227
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:14,520
It's waited over a decade for this
spring and now, its time is near.

228
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,279
All across the Arctic,
moths are emerging.

229
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:27,079
After completing
their 14-year preparation,

230
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:31,040
they now have just a few days
to find a partner and mate.

231
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:41,199
No life illustrates more vividly
the shortness of the Arctic spring

232
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,400
or the struggle to survive
in this most seasonal of places.

233
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,759
As spring advances,

234
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,840
the transformation
of the tundra continues.

235
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,920
THEY SQUEAK

236
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,720
CHEEPING

237
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,839
Migrants begin arriving
from the south

238
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:58,360
and suddenly the tundra
is alive with birds and chicks.

239
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,280
The Arctic's transformation
is complete.

240
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:28,400
This influx of life is good news
for some permanent residents.

241
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,759
Food is rarely plentiful
out on the tundra.

242
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:42,960
The Arctic wolves must make the most
of this boom while it lasts.

243
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,040
HONKING

244
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:42,359
The wolves must gather
as much food as they can.

245
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:46,879
Many miles from here, other members
of the pack are relying on them.

246
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,240
HOWLING

247
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,519
This barren landscape is a hard
place to make a living,

248
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,560
forcing wolf packs to be smaller
here than further south.

249
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,119
Six hungry mouths to feed.

250
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,199
The cubs are just over a month old.

251
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,440
BARKING AND YELPING

252
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,599
The ducks are devoured instantly,
but on the long journey home,

253
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,879
they also caught an Arctic hare,
a mainstay of the tundra diet,

254
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:43,160
and one the cubs
seem to be particularly keen on.

255
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,279
Uneaten food is usually hidden
for leaner times,

256
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:59,159
but there will be
no leftovers today.

257
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,400
The cubs are growing fast
and are always hungry.

258
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,080
GROWLING

259
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:23,559
The good times are certainly back,
but these white wolves remind us

260
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,080
of the Arctic's less welcoming side.

261
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:32,040
Their coats are pale to conceal them
during the long, snowy winter.

262
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,479
It's easy to forget
that one month ago,

263
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,480
this land was a barren,
white desert.

264
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,439
At the southern end of our planet,

265
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,560
the Antarctic sea ice
is still at its greatest extent.

266
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,759
But there are a few islands
on its outer edge

267
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:03,360
that the sea ice
never quite reaches.

268
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:11,719
South Georgia is washed by the rich
waters of the Southern Atlantic

269
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,119
and the comparative warmth
of the sea

270
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,920
takes the edge off
the vicious southern winter.

271
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:28,599
It's even possible
for a few hardy animals,

272
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:33,360
like the Wandering Albatross, to
live here throughout the whole year.

273
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:47,199
The enormous Albatross chicks
take 13 months to fledge,

274
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,159
so they have no choice but
to sit here throughout the winter.

275
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,159
It can't be easy,
but the thick layer of fluffy down

276
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,280
keeps out the worst of the cold.

277
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:01,559
Their parents travel thousands
of miles to collect the fish

278
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,480
and squid they need
to stay warm and to grow.

279
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:19,440
The season is turning and storms
blow in with little warning.

280
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,400
King penguins have also been here
all winter.

281
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,599
Their chicks survive by huddling
in creches to conserve their heat.

282
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:45,279
A solitary bird here standing alone
would quickly die of exposure.

283
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:50,559
It seems for a hardy few, violent
storms are a price worth paying

284
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:55,640
for year-round fishing in the
rich waters of the southern ocean.

285
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:05,719
The penguins have had the beach
to themselves all winter,

286
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,360
but that is a luxury
that will not last.

287
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:20,520
As the winter storms subside,
life begins to return.

288
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,159
For half of the year, South Georgia
has the greatest concentration

289
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,679
of sea birds in the world

290
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,880
and most of them arrive
in the early spring.

291
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:51,919
Macaroni penguins make
the most impressive entrance...

292
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,199
over five million pairs of them.

293
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,839
They are the world's
most numerous penguin

294
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,160
and half of them are now here.

295
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,840
The arrival is complete.

296
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:11,920
Courtship is next on South Georgia's
busy spring schedule.

297
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,919
The Wandering Albatross
has the most elaborate display.

298
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,040
MIXED-PITCH "POPPING"

299
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,080
These two are renewing their bonds
after being months apart.

300
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,519
Wanderers pair up in their teens

301
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,119
and can spend
a further 50 years together...

302
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,680
one of the longest partnerships
in the animal world.

303
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,799
By the middle of spring,
the snows have cleared

304
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,039
from the coves and the low ground.

305
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,919
The beaches are almost free
of ice too,

306
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,079
but that isn't the biggest change
facing the king penguins.

307
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:30,880
Their peaceful waterfront has turned
into an obstacle course of blubber.

308
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,720
The elephant seals have arrived.

309
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,399
This beach now contains
a greater mass of animals

310
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,960
than any other in the world.

311
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,079
The young seals
were conceived here a year ago,

312
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,439
and now that they've been born,

313
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,880
their mothers are ready
to mate again.

314
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:09,959
The mating rights on this patch of
the beach belong to a beach master.

315
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,159
His harem contains 50 females...

316
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,840
females that are coveted by others.

317
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,480
His authority is being challenged.

318
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,160
This rival means business.

319
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,679
This could be the beach master's
first serious test

320
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,760
of his spring campaign.

321
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:59,239
The beach master himself
weighs four tonnes,

322
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,640
but this rival is his equal.

323
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,479
When these titans clash,

324
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,160
bones crunch.

325
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,639
He has won the first battle,

326
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:11,080
but he may have to defend his harem
every hour for the next month.

327
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,439
If he can stay master
of his beach for this period,

328
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,680
many of the young born here
next year will be his.

329
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,559
It's the end of spring on
the Wandering Albatross's cliffs,

330
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,439
their season for fledging.

331
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,319
Last year's chicks
have lost their fluffy down

332
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:37,800
and step up to the challenge
of getting into the air.

333
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,720
SQUAWKING

334
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:54,479
An albatross is not very
competent on the ground,

335
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,239
so until it can fly,
it isn't good for much

336
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,999
and this makes the maiden flight

337
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,840
THE crucial event
in an albatross's life.

338
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,880
Managing the largest wing span
in the world takes practice...

339
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,320
lots of it.

340
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,199
Weeks can go by like this.

341
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:40,079
Certainly the winds must be right,
but it does appear that for some,

342
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,280
the problem is something
of a mental one.

343
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,120
At last.

344
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,879
The Southern Ocean beckons.

345
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,920
This bird's feet will not touch land
again for five years.

346
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,799
1,000 miles further south,

347
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,679
on the edge
of the Antarctic continent,

348
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:27,239
the sea ice is only just
starting to break.

349
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:32,279
But the Adelie penguin's activities
are certainly warming up.

350
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:36,599
The males have now finished
their nests by fair means or foul

351
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:40,719
and the females
are finally returning,

352
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,879
just as the weather is improving.

353
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:46,199
Now their courtship can begin.

354
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,120
RHYTHMIC CAWING

355
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,079
The eggs are laid and the females
leave the job of incubating them

356
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:52,040
to the males, while they go fishing
out on the fragmenting sea ice.

357
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,440
Killer whales.

358
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:16,120
It's teamwork that makes
killer whales so dangerous.

359
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,800
And THIS is a big team.

360
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,360
There is no real need
for the penguins to be alarmed.

361
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:23,200
These killer whales
are a kind that only eats fish.

362
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,839
Rising out is simply the best way
for the whales to work out

363
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:35,520
which cracks lead towards the coast
and better fishing.

364
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,439
A new generation of Adelies
steps forth

365
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,799
into the short Antarctic spring

366
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,159
to be nurtured by industrious
parents who've taken great risks

367
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,040
to give their young a head start.

368
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,599
They will need to grow fast
if they are to fledge

369
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:11,080
and leave before the freeze
sets in again.

370
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:18,040
It's a battle they will win or lose
over the approaching summer.

371
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,919
Next time,

372
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:39,159
summer and the sun never sets
in the polar regions.

373
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:42,760
The heat is on
for the Frozen Planet.

374
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:10,799
To film the entire breeding cycle
of the Adelie penguin,

375
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,519
Frozen Planet sent a team to one
of the world's largest colonies,

376
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,399
at Cape Crozier, Antarctica.

377
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,639
I've heard so much about it
and read so much about it.

378
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:22,119
Finally we're going to get there.
It's good.

379
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:25,199
Cameraman Mark Smith
and director Jeff Wilson

380
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,719
plan to spend the next four months
living amongst the penguins

381
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:32,000
in a location first visited by
the early explorers a century ago.

382
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:37,679
So arduous was Scott's
winter expedition to Cape Crozier

383
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:41,839
that it became known as
"the worst journey in the world".

384
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:45,760
Wow, it's fantastic!

385
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,559
Modern means make Mark and Jeff's
journey a more comfortable affair,

386
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,759
but once there, they will be tested

387
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:55,080
to the very limits
of their endurance.

388
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:02,719
The pair arrive in early spring

389
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:05,420
with enough supplies to
survive the next four

390
00:49:05,421 --> 00:49:08,119
months working alone in
the Antarctic wilderness.

391
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,000
We're here!

392
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:15,279
Scott's legend of Cape Crozier
tells of some extreme weather,

393
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,079
to say the least,

394
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:21,559
so Mark and Jeff take advantage
of the clear conditions,

395
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:24,320
in the knowledge that
the Adelies' arrival is imminent.

396
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:30,679
But the next morning,
things take a turn for the worse.

397
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,839
We've just come up to this ridge

398
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:35,719
to go and check what it looks like
down in the colony.

399
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:38,719
ROARING

400
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,679
But even here you can hear...

401
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:44,559
a huge kind of roaring noise

402
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:48,640
up on the hill. Never really heard
anything like that before.

403
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,279
Up there, it must be blowing
the most almighty gale,

404
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:59,519
and that is, pff, you know,
just a mile away or something.

405
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:02,719
So that means that that could
get here very, very quickly.

406
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:06,999
So yeah, it makes you slightly
scared. It's weird, isn't it?

407
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,319
The winds here
are famously ferocious,

408
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:13,359
and with so little experience
of this location,

409
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:18,039
Mark and Jeff retreat to
the relative shelter of their hut.

410
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,919
I was just stood here thinking,
"Well, it can't be too bad,"

411
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,919
"because we haven't seen rocks
starting to blow around yet,"

412
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:29,200
and just at that moment a rock
took off and rolled down there.

413
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:36,520
Oh, dear, it's getting stronger.

414
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,359
By the second day of the storm,
the winds reach 80 miles an hour,

415
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:44,599
and it's apparent that even getting
lunch from the outside larder

416
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,160
is too risky.

417
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:00,720
To their increasing alarm,
the storm continues to build.

418
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:05,520
All afternoon, it's
been blowing about...

419
00:51:05,521 --> 00:51:08,359
must have been 100
miles an hour,

420
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:11,679
and in the last half-hour
it's just got a lot stronger.

421
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,520
Aside from being utterly terrified,

422
00:51:13,521 --> 00:51:16,879
there's the added worry that our
gear is stashed outside somewhere.

423
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,359
We didn't have room for it
in the hut,

424
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:22,719
and we don't know whether it's
going to be there in the morning,

425
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,039
which could spell
the end of our trip.

426
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:30,839
On the third day of the storm,
the winds hit 130 miles an hour.

427
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,879
The hut starts to shake
from its very foundations,

428
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,959
and Mark and Jeff's situation
becomes critical.

429
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,319
The wind's so strong,

430
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:42,599
it's constantly blowing the pilot
light out on the paraffin stove,

431
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,639
so the temperature's dropping.

432
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:49,280
The wind's rising. Sounds like
the bloody roof's coming off.

433
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,959
The really scary thing is that
had we gone out down to the colony

434
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,039
and tried to film today,

435
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:01,879
there's a very high likelihood
that we'd be dead by now.

436
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:04,519
And I don't say that lightly.

437
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:07,599
There's no way we would have
seen this through down there.

438
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:10,760
And that is quite sobering.

439
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:21,079
After four terrifying days
inside the hut,

440
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:24,239
the winds finally drop,
and Mark and Jeff are keen to see

441
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,639
what, if any, equipment
has survived.

442
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:32,279
All the real important stuff,
the camera stuff, is all still here,

443
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:35,759
and it's still strapped
to this rock.

444
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,999
You have no idea
how much joy that gives us.

445
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,480
We can get on with our jobs now!

446
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:49,559
The first things to welcome us
to the colony are these skuas,

447
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:54,160
which come in
and batter us from above.

448
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:06,639
At its height, the colony will swell
to over half a million penguins,

449
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:09,799
and in the 24-hour daylight
of the Antarctic summer,

450
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:14,079
Mark and Jeff spend
all of their waking hours filming.

451
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:17,279
Unpredictable weather
continues to force the team

452
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:22,399
to climb the two miles back to
the relative shelter of their hut,

453
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:25,880
and Mark devises a novel way
of testing the wind speed.

454
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,560
Stop!

455
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,759
After six weeks,
the first sign that the pair

456
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:40,039
might be tiring
of their penguin neighbours.

457
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:41,999
Over there's a leopard seal.

458
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,559
It's the first non-penguin-looking
animal in two months!

459
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:48,920
Will you look at that?
It's a leopard seal!

460
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,559
I was down here
filming the penguins coming in,

461
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:55,399
followed this penguin that came
out of the waves up the beach,

462
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:58,279
very nice shot, stopped the shot

463
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:02,679
and there in the middle of the frame
was this completely white penguin...

464
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:05,519
trying to get into the shot.

465
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,120
We suspect that he might be
following us around now.

466
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:14,839
Working around the clock
for this length of time

467
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:17,759
in the presence
of half a million screaming penguins

468
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,000
would test anyone's resolve.

469
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,260
I hate carrying gear. Hear that?
I hate carrying gear.

470
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:26,560
I don't want to do it any more.

471
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:32,959
Midway through their trip, after more
than 1,000 hours amongst the penguins,

472
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:36,200
their grip on reality
is beginning to loosen.

473
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:40,239
Here we are
on the penguin superhighway,

474
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:43,400
where the penguins
go down to the sea.

475
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:49,159
It seems that they follow
the American system...

476
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:54,239
driving on the right, going down
to the sea on the right,

477
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:57,960
coming back from the sea on
the left as you're facing the sea.

478
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:03,760
I'm fairly sure that yesterday
they were doing the British system.

479
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:12,119
The legendary Cape Crozier weather
soon snaps them back into reality.

480
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:14,199
I'm just filming the penguins

481
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:18,399
with this huge kind of wind storm

482
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,999
coming over the ice cap,

483
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,559
the kind of thing we were warned
about by the guy who was here before,

484
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:25,680
who has been here several
years, saying "With

485
00:55:25,681 --> 00:55:27,799
skies like this, you
should run for home".

486
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,279
But we're just going to stay
and film it.

487
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:32,079
Because we're the BBC!

488
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,559
But in this part of the world,

489
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:37,199
working for the BBC
doesn't count for much.

490
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,959
Within minutes,
the winds reach hurricane strength,

491
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:43,319
and the crew are in serious trouble.

492
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:46,679
So, we've got to now venture out
and go about a mile up this valley,

493
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:51,159
which looks like it's got
about 80mph winds blowing down it.

494
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:53,359
So it's going to be
quite an adventure.

495
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:56,199
Bit frightening, though, really.

496
00:55:56,200 --> 00:56:00,399
After three months,
the pair are now fully aware

497
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,719
of the strength the winds can reach.
Getting a little stronger now!

498
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,559
There is a very real danger

499
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:09,200
that they could be separated and
lost in these white-out conditions.

500
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,880
We're going to go BLEEP.

501
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:40,519
Two terrifying hours later,
and their relief

502
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:43,519
at finally reaching the
hut is tangible.

503
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,920
THEY LAUGH

504
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,279
With a month still to go
at Cape Crozier,

505
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:54,319
Mark, Jeff and the penguins will
face many more storms like this.

506
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:56,439
But it seems
their greatest challenge
