So mating and breeding is very intense and demanding for many species, such as polar bears. The ice 'lives' spectacularly too, even helps steer worldwide currents and weather. The unending struggle for survival is particularly merciless. The less known ice seas are no less rich in extraordinary, well-adapted wildlife.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "2095246", "rating": 8.7, "votes": 919, "number_of_episodes": 10}
