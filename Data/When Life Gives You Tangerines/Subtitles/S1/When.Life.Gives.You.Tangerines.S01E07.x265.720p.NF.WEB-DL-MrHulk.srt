1
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,982
WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU TANGERINES

2
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:13,031
{\an8}DAUGHTER OF YANG GWAN-SIK AND OH AE-SUN
YANG GEUM-MYEONG! ACCEPTED TO SNU!

3
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:23,583
{\an8}'88 SEOUL OLYMPICS CELEBRATION
ADVANCED CITIZENS! ADVANCED STREETS!

4
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:27,712
{\an8}So what if it's the Olympics for you?
We have the Olympics here every day too.

5
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,799
<i>Survival was their Olympics.</i>

6
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,968
No, it's not what you think.

7
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,512
It's not like that, so…

8
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:39,849
<i>They fought through their own grand</i>
<i>yet cruel Olympics every single time.</i>

9
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:40,975
Please just leave!

10
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:45,063
<i>…without medals, pensions, or retirement.</i>

11
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,024
Why are you flipping them?

12
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:52,654
What does flipping our stalls have to do
with your Olympics?

13
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:58,326
Did conches and sauries protest
against the Olympics?

14
00:01:58,409 --> 00:01:59,661
Did they block the roads?

15
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:03,748
Come on, seriously!

16
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,376
How many times have I told you?

17
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,129
The Olympic torch is coming through here!

18
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,798
Americans will be watching this on TV.

19
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,383
Should we just show them

20
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:16,886
this mess of fish intestines
and a fishy stench?

21
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,597
Do their televisions have noses
attached to them?

22
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:23,143
The government has told us
to clean up things that lack aesthetics.

23
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,727
The government!

24
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:25,770
The government!

25
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,397
Aesthetics?

26
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:28,982
Aesthetics?

27
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,693
You're taking away our livelihood

28
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:34,237
to impress some people
on the other side of the world?

29
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,948
What kind of dog crap is that?

30
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:39,159
Is that how Americans do things?

31
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,953
Taking even a beggar's bowl?

32
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:42,871
For God's sake.

33
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:46,166
Why don't you fight for the country
instead of selling sauries?

34
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:49,377
We should accept a little loss
for the greater good.

35
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,046
You're always nitpicking
every tiny detail!

36
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,591
Someone greased your palm, didn't they?

37
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,094
What, because I don't have money?

38
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:01,556
How much did they pay you
for the town's blood, sweat, and tears?

39
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,557
How much?

40
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,642
And you call yourself our chief?

41
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:07,228
Did you major in saying ten things
after hearing one?

42
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,938
- What?
- It's next September.

43
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,107
The torch will pass through here briefly.

44
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,860
We live hand to mouth.
You're cutting off our source of income!

45
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,653
What kind of law is that?

46
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,697
What do you know about the law?

47
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,282
Do you even know anything?

48
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,326
Oh Ae-sun!

49
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:22,869
Where is Ae-sun?

50
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:26,164
Our deputy chief
is a high school graduate!

51
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:27,957
She dropped out of high school.

52
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,419
- What do you mean "graduate"?
- But she went to high school!

53
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:34,380
Where is our deputy chief?

54
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,133
- Ae-sun!
- Our deputy chief is the smartest!

55
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,552
- Ae-sun!
- Why are you looking for her?

56
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,930
She wouldn't know what to say!

57
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:45,350
Why can't I sell my sauries
just because the nation is celebrating?

58
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:47,727
Why do your sauries even matter now?

59
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,396
If North Korea wants to ruin the Olympics

60
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,274
and open the Mount Kumgang dam,
all of Seoul will be flooded.

61
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:56,027
They say that even the 63 SQUARE
will be submerged.

62
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,113
Do you keep up with current affairs?
Do you understand the greater good?

63
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:03,743
Are sauries really more important
than the great…ness of history?

64
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,578
Of course they're important!

65
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,622
- They're important!
- So frustrating.

66
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,710
You think a rebellion happens
for no reason?

67
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:17,924
Even a dog will crap all over and leave
if you tip over its food bowl!

68
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,717
Do you want some of ours?

69
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,636
- Let go!
- Do you want some?

70
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,555
Ae-sun!

71
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:28,059
She's here. Here's Ae-sun.

72
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:29,143
There you are.

73
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:30,853
Hey!

74
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,690
Hey. Deputy.

75
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,567
Hey! Deputy!

76
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:53,501
Is she the crap you mentioned? Is she?

77
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,299
You better get up.

78
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:02,385
<i>This is a silent outcry</i>…

79
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,470
What did you say?

80
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,265
<i>Lashed by the scourge</i>
<i>Of the bitter season</i>…

81
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:10,268
If you're embarrassed, just get up.
Don't try anything.

82
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,146
<i>If you choose to leave…</i>

83
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,188
Hey, call a forklift!

84
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,398
Let it roll over me!

85
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,151
Hey, this is a gangster,
not a high school graduate.

86
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:21,821
Taking people's livelihoods away
makes you a gangster, not me.

87
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,781
What did you just say?

88
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:24,824
Roll over me.

89
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:27,035
Seriously, what's wrong with you?

90
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,411
Roll over me!

91
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,663
Just do as you're told!

92
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,540
I said roll over me!

93
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,002
Roll over me!

94
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:45,470
Hey, what happened to our Literary Girl?

95
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:47,638
What do you mean?

96
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:49,891
Life happened, that's what.

97
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,225
Damn you!

98
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,395
{\an8}For goodness' sake!

99
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,688
{\an8}Hey, Bu Sang-gil!

100
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,775
{\an8}You betrayed the people's trust,
and you'll definitely pay the price.

101
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,363
Politics is like the wind, you know?

102
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,239
Rumors are spreading like wildfire

103
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,575
that Ae-sun will be
the next fishing co-op chief.

104
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:10,578
Come on, I have no interest in politics.

105
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:11,913
I think you'll run for office.

106
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,624
People like her always end up
running for office.

107
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,753
This election will be
between a stooge and a freedom fighter.

108
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:21,339
That spineless traitor.

109
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,549
If we side with that treacherous stooge,

110
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,052
they'll screw us over
right under our noses.

111
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,429
So what if he's the chief.

112
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,723
How dare he call a person "deputy"!

113
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,976
Deputy Chief is the official title,
and he's always like, "Deputy!"

114
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,104
"Hey, Deputy!" That's how he addresses me.

115
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,189
She never liked being a deputy.

116
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:40,316
If a dog can be the chief, why can't you?

117
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,277
Let's make a chief
out of one of our <i>haenyeo </i>crew.

118
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:47,281
I really have no interest in politics!

119
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:51,619
You won't let your darling
Gwan-sik's dream come true?

120
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,665
What's gotten into you?

121
00:06:56,749 --> 00:07:00,002
Our captain must be
campaigning for someone.

122
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:01,838
What's this for?

123
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,756
Who do you want us to vote for?

124
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,301
Captain Yang,
now that you've paid me off, speak up.

125
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:08,678
Well…

126
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,390
I'm not saying this because she's my wife.

127
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:16,185
But Ae-sun was class president
back in the day.

128
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,478
I saw it myself.

129
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,065
I can honestly say

130
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:25,153
that I've never met anyone
as smart as Ae-sun.

131
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,822
Have you ever been smart enough
to become class president?

132
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,583
Let's be frank between us.

133
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,878
Do you actually want Ae-sun
to be the chief?

134
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:46,507
Your wife would be
the first female chief of Dodong-ri.

135
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,092
What does that make you?

136
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:51,387
A real man should have some pride.

137
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,182
Yes, she'd be the first, but so would I.

138
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,767
If Ae-sun becomes the first female chief,

139
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,729
I'd be the first husband of a chief.

140
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,483
Pride is even better
when you earn it without effort.

141
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,985
That's enough, okay?

142
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:08,279
You're making the rest of us men
look like trash.

143
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:11,199
Our captain has dreams
that are very different from ours.

144
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,662
So, this is a brand-new item.

145
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,711
<i>I'm going to do all of it.</i>
<i>I'll be the chief of the fishing co-op.</i>

146
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:26,005
I'm also going to be
the president five times.

147
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,676
What do you want to become?

148
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,512
Don't even ask him!

149
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,765
The First Lady.

150
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:38,768
The First Lady.

151
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:40,895
So…

152
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,813
What is it? First Lady.

153
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,984
I think they put… real bananas in those.

154
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,653
Premium bananas.

155
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,490
You drank it all.

156
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,202
Hey, man.

157
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:58,246
This banana milk is nothing.

158
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:01,290
<i>That tightwad is buying pork for everyone.</i>

159
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,251
<i>Who in the world doesn't like pork?</i>

160
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:04,335
SALT-GRILLED PORK

161
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:05,836
Not just any pig.

162
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,880
Jeju Black pig, you know?

163
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,549
Jeju Black pig.

164
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,926
Premium Jeju Black pig.

165
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,804
Give each table an extra portion
that looks like a double.

166
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,806
We only serve Jeju Black pig.

167
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:20,810
I really don't have any ulterior motive.

168
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,896
Look, I have no shortage
of money or honor.

169
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:27,316
I only ever have one concern on my mind.

170
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,237
How can I give our co-op members
one more thing to eat?

171
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,991
"How can I find one more thing to give?"

172
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:40,746
Listen, you should pay attention
while you eat.

173
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:45,585
You squeeze all of us into this tiny place
just so we can nibble on the pork.

174
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,422
Finish your plate,
then you can order more.

175
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,758
I don't think you'd vote for me,
but you're here.

176
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:56,429
You should bribe generously.
What a stingy briber.

177
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,098
So, anyway,

178
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,727
Oh Ae-sun appeared out of nowhere,

179
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,979
but I hail from Dodong-ri.

180
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,607
I am the rightful heir to the--

181
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,943
I asked for a soda ages ago.

182
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,112
Not everyone can hold a big title, right?

183
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,449
We need to carefully examine
the candidates' backgrounds

184
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:19,535
and any family issues they may have.

185
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,829
What problems does the deputy chief have?

186
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:24,957
Gwan-sik is receiving a commendation.
Do you have one?

187
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,710
It's a plaque of appreciation,
not a commendation.

188
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,171
I could easily get
more than a dozen of those.

189
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,506
- You know--
- But you don't have any.

190
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,508
Have you ever saved anyone from drowning?

191
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,927
Stop cutting me off already!

192
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:39,221
Learn to listen when others are talking.

193
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:42,516
These women talk about what they want
every chance they get.

194
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,728
How about you? Why act like
you didn't hear me ask for a soda?

195
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,105
As you all know,

196
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:51,275
that family isn't exactly
a great example for others.

197
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:56,614
They ran away from home at 18
and had a daughter.

198
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,908
She's a student at SNU.

199
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,618
Not their second child.

200
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:05,539
There's no need to talk about
someone else's kid, but…

201
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,167
Never mind. I shouldn't.

202
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,711
Then don't. And get me a soda!

203
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,547
If you sow beans, you'll only reap beans.

204
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:17,593
Being a nutjob is hereditary, you know?

205
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:25,184
DODONG-RI FISHING CO-OP DEPUTY CHIEF
MOTHER OF YANG EUN-MYEONG

206
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:26,936
DODONG-RI FISHING CO-OP CHIEF

207
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,154
<i>Wait, have you been to the salon?</i>

208
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:42,410
Take this off.

209
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,831
How many student leaders' moms are coming?

210
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:47,832
All of them?

211
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:52,753
But wait, you were the PE leader?

212
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,505
Why you?

213
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,590
That's funny.

214
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:03,973
The other moms are gonna flip out
when they get here,

215
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,851
asking how your sister
got into Seoul National University

216
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:09,770
and what the secret was. Goodness me.

217
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,355
Someone's excited.

218
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,608
It's at 4:00, right? Let's go.

219
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,945
- Mom.
- Am I a bit early?

220
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:21,323
- Mother!
- Should I go to the faculty room?

221
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,867
There aren't any other moms.

222
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:27,455
Why not? You said they invited
all the leaders' mothers to come.

223
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,039
It's just you.

224
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,207
Why?

225
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:35,463
Hello, sir.

226
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,715
No need to come in. Let's go out.

227
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:38,632
Pardon me?

228
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:40,760
Let's go outside.

229
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,939
My car is now an Onata?

230
00:12:56,525 --> 00:13:00,112
The Chinese teacher's car is now Pon!

231
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,698
Our dear Eun-myeong
is getting all the kids into university.

232
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,576
So that's it, huh? Anyone gets in
if you get them the initials?

233
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,161
Is that how your sister got in?

234
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:11,540
He doesn't just give them away.
He takes them off and sells them.

235
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:16,837
Ma'am, this is a very serious matter.

236
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:21,467
The principal's car is now a Tellar!

237
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,805
<i>I've been teaching for about 20 years.</i>

238
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:30,476
Yang Eun-myeong is the first to ever turn
a teacher's car into an Onata!

239
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,228
I'm sorry.

240
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,230
Your son seems like he's here to work.

241
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,357
I heard he's good with his hands.

242
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:40,820
He cuts a set of ten bus tickets
into eleven

243
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,488
and makes a profit of 50 won.

244
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:46,283
The coin game's being played out there?
That'll be Eun-myeong, then!

245
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:50,287
Is school some kind of gambling den?
Is he running a business here?

246
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,331
Is he a teacher or something?

247
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,252
Why would a student come to school
to earn a paycheck?

248
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,212
I'm sorry.

249
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:01,549
You focused so much on your daughter
and neglected your son, didn't you?

250
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,594
Do you know what kind of kids
your son hangs out with?

251
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,443
Keep your distance.

252
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,822
Don't even talk to me.

253
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:30,786
You said it was just a leaders' meeting!

254
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,539
Who told you to make money?

255
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,916
Why don't you study? Why focus on money?

256
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,918
I never felt embarrassed

257
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,462
coming to school for your sister.

258
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,632
But now, I can't hold my head up!

259
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:45,801
Stop hitting that!

260
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,808
What's wrong with you?
What did I ever do to you?

261
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,394
I told you to do half
of what your sister did, didn't I?

262
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,062
I raised both of you the same way.

263
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,189
Do half as well
so you can become the chief?

264
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,901
Being a nutjob is in the genes,
so I'll be in your way.

265
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,445
Don't listen to what people say!

266
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:07,364
- I hate Bu Sang-gil.
- You're embarrassed by me, aren't you?

267
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,409
You only want to be
Geum-myeong's mom, huh?

268
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,936
<i>Not everyone in her family is a nutjob.</i>

269
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,563
<i>But education isn't everything in life.</i>

270
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,649
<i>Whose daughter is she, after all?</i>

271
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,819
<i>Sure, she's up in Seoul,</i>

272
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,907
<i>but she's just going to end up</i>
<i>a dating queen too.</i>

273
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,784
CELEBRATING DIRECT PRESIDENTIAL
ELECTION SYSTEM

274
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,919
He always picks her up these days.
Is that her boyfriend?

275
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,337
Is he rich or something?

276
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:06,423
Even if he is, how can a college student
drive a car like that?

277
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,801
Something's off about that girl.

278
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:13,055
Look at the news.
Lots of college girls work as escorts.

279
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:16,225
They get paid to go on dates
and spend time with older men.

280
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:18,268
Ju-gyeong.

281
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,229
Show some respect.

282
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,159
Is he from the US?

283
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,539
Is he not embarrassed?
He's opening the door for her in public.

284
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:41,333
Guys like that cut pork cutlets
for girls at restaurants.

285
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:14,199
<i>Love is all I know</i>

286
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,957
Whose child is she?

287
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:27,046
As they say, it's so blindingly obvious.
I don't even need eyes to see it.

288
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:32,968
That family never cared
about keeping boys and girls apart.

289
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:38,557
{\an8}Hey, you may have bought the tree,
but that rock isn't yours, is it?

290
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,018
Why did you write your name
on the public property?

291
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,061
Think about it.

292
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,564
She should be grateful
to be the deputy chief,

293
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:46,690
but she has no clue.

294
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,233
Who does she think she is?

295
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,151
Hey, Captain.

296
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,487
Do you actually have any campaign pledges?

297
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,571
What?

298
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:55,157
I think you're splashing out
just to bash your opponent.

299
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:00,287
I'm not bashing anyone.

300
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,081
I'm just discussing morality.

301
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,583
Don't you realize
people have the right to know?

302
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:05,584
<i>Don't you know?</i>

303
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:06,627
BADA SEAFOOD HOUSE

304
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,630
Why would he bring your kids into this?

305
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,884
Shit-gil crossed the line with that one.

306
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,095
You fight back too.

307
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:20,349
<i>If you keep this up,</i>
<i>Ae-sun's going to fight back.</i>

308
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,268
Ae-sun's just holding back
because she has class.

309
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,479
If she really wanted to play dirty,

310
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:28,232
you wouldn't exactly come out
looking so clean either.

311
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:32,653
Sang-gil's father was the first
during the Japanese occupation.

312
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:36,240
First to surrender his Korean name
to the Japanese in Jeju.

313
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,077
Hold on.

314
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,330
There's nothing you can say about me,
even if you want to.

315
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:44,790
I'm a man

316
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,585
who makes donations to our government.

317
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,295
<i>As for Oh Ae-sun?</i>

318
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:54,508
<i>I'm pretty sure</i>
<i>she's never given a dime to charity.</i>

319
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,638
Politics is just a field
of dog crap anyway.

320
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:02,641
If you're going to roll in it,
black fur is better than white.

321
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:05,477
Who cares what fur a dog has
if it rolls around in crap?

322
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,104
It's just a dog with crap on it.

323
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:09,273
I'm going to win with my pledges.

324
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,902
Wow, Oh Ae-sun is still so noble.

325
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,822
You're not handing out soap.
You're not feeding them pork.

326
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,907
And you're not playing dirty?

327
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,993
Then you're going to lose.

328
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:27,624
Ae-sun, the co-op members have the right
to know Sang-gil's true colors.

329
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,210
He was the first to cross the line.

330
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,462
You might as well too.

331
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:36,967
A cocoon that doesn't break open in time
gets devoured by predators.

332
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:41,597
Only the ones that break free quickly
emerge as butterflies.

333
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,976
You need to learn how to open the doors
that are in your way, just like this.

334
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,313
<i>In every ferry</i>
<i>That reaches the Oryukdo Islets</i>

335
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:55,903
<i>People can take turns to bad-mouth me</i>

336
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,989
<i>No matter how hard they try</i>

337
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:05,204
<i>They won't find a speck of dust on me</i>

338
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:08,999
<i>That's the worst thing about me</i>

339
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:13,921
<i>Try to find something on me all you want</i>

340
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,047
Stop singing!

341
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,507
I'm not voting for you
if I lose my appetite.

342
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,093
Damn it!

343
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,720
Hey, where are my noodles?

344
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,724
He's always picking on his wife.

345
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:30,771
You can't even make noodles quickly.

346
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,065
Just walk home.

347
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,651
Don't get in my car. Got it?

348
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:36,944
Hey, Bu Sang-gil.

349
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:40,155
Your surname means "deputy" anyway.

350
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,699
It means you're the "deputy" captain
on the boat

351
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,993
and the "deputy" chief
for the fishing co-op.

352
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,040
- Hey!
- Are you voting for me or not?

353
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:54,002
Why do you always come and pick a fight?
Is it because I didn't buy you a soda?

354
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,130
Hey, in case you lose the election…

355
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,382
Why would I lose?

356
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:01,426
Do you know how much the pork
and noodles cost?

357
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,388
Just be content
with being the deputy chief.

358
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,515
Even on the <i>Animal Quiz Show,</i>

359
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,725
if the Alpha is defeated,

360
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:13,855
it will instantly become the pack Omega.

361
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,565
- Hey!
- "Hey"?

362
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:16,900
Did you say "hey"?

363
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,444
- "Hey"?
- Am I getting those noodles anytime today?

364
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,615
You can vote for Oh Ae-sun if you want.

365
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,785
FROM BU SANG-GIL, CANDIDATE 1

366
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:30,247
The Oh may be smart,
and the Bu may be lacking,

367
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,416
but a female chief?

368
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:33,875
Nowhere in this nation!

369
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,628
- No, of course not.
- A box of cigarettes each.

370
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,881
I wish it was always election season.

371
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:43,552
How can a gentle breeze
from the pines stop a typhoon?

372
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:46,555
Democracy? It's all about numbers.

373
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,682
Stick with the majority.

374
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,351
The chief must be the Bu!

375
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,063
All right!

376
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:55,981
Pour me some.

377
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,774
Now!

378
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,278
- The chief is…
- The Bu!

379
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,364
- The chief is…
- The Bu!

380
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,993
- The chief is…
- The Bu!

381
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:12,706
Lucky you.

382
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:14,333
I hope you're the chief forever.

383
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:19,296
Indecency runs in that family!

384
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:20,672
I named my daughters

385
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,008
Hyeon-suk for "virtuous"
and Jeong-suk for "pure."

386
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:23,925
And I

387
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,970
like those who are virtuous.

388
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,181
What a load of crap.

389
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,357
I am

390
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:43,403
a candidate with nothing to be ashamed of.

391
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,490
The thing is,

392
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:50,786
life has been so difficult for me.

393
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:56,249
We could clear out all the street stalls,
and I still wouldn't make much from it.

394
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:02,172
A real estate office in this small town
barely makes any money.

395
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:06,927
I just wanted to make a little dough
from the Olympics,

396
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,429
but those <i>haenyeo </i>are so stubborn.

397
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,057
For real, you know me.

398
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,393
- Yeah.
- I'm a softie.

399
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,269
Mi-suk, you know me.

400
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:18,688
I'll take care of everything.

401
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:20,148
Without a doubt,

402
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:24,027
I'm going to be the chief again.

403
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,071
Really?

404
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:29,324
You'd really take care of everything?

405
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,785
I don't need to pay you a fee or anything?

406
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:32,911
Just give me 30.

407
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,831
- What?
- You keep 70%. I'll take 30.

408
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,252
Right, I see.

409
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,505
Even a flea's liver should be shared.

410
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:49,177
Mi-suk, I'm Bu Sang-gil of Dodong-ri.

411
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:50,762
Mi-suk.

412
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:56,476
I don't have romance in my life,
but I do have money.

413
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,394
I am

414
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,647
just one lonely man.

415
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,653
There's no need to be shy around me.

416
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,323
I'm not shy.

417
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,077
No, I mean…

418
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,707
You think I'd help you
do all this for money?

419
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:22,836
Then what are you doing it for?

420
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,799
What are you looking at?

421
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,595
Come on.

422
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,806
It's the Olympics, right?

423
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,809
Even the Soviet Union
chose to stand hand in hand

424
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,687
and break down the walls.

425
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,814
Why don't we break down…

426
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,151
the wall between us?

427
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:54,910
Eat this. Your stomach will hurt.

428
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:55,827
Wait.

429
00:24:55,911 --> 00:25:00,248
Mi-suk's saury just struck me
like an arrow in the heart.

430
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:06,087
Perhaps this isn't just any saury.

431
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:09,758
Is it okay to think of it
as Mi-suk's heart instead?

432
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:12,677
Yeah, sure.

433
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:14,429
Abalone?

434
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:19,392
You make everything else in the world
seem like <i>baloney.</i>

435
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:25,065
Just eat the shrimp.

436
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:30,946
Now you mention it,
you're making <i>my </i>shrimp…

437
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:32,739
You're so silly!

438
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:33,949
What? What's wrong?

439
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,659
You're making me really excited.

440
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,370
You make my heart excited. What?

441
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,914
You're witty. I'll give you that.

442
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:48,880
Hey, you…

443
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:53,343
came here to eat some sea squirts.

444
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,055
Why are you serenading my solitude?

445
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:01,726
That tickles.

446
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:05,814
Disgusting.

447
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:09,276
You're so disgusting. Seriously.

448
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:14,864
You need to learn how to open the doors
that are in your way, just like this.

449
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:19,369
Wait. What's all this…

450
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:23,123
What are you doing here? Damn it.

451
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:27,043
I was wondering
why you chose to be the stooge.

452
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:31,131
You're so disgusting
that we can't even crack open sea squirts.

453
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:33,800
What the hell are you doing here again?

454
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:38,138
Who do you think you are,
meddling in my life all the time?

455
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:41,099
This is my part-time job. So what?

456
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:45,228
While a saury struck your heart,

457
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:47,939
she was cracking open another sea squirt.

458
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,900
Wait, why were you eavesdropping on us?

459
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:51,985
- Why?
- Hey!

460
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:56,990
You just want to be chief so you can
massage another woman's feet, huh?

461
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:00,577
Goddamn it!

462
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,247
But you can't even be the chief anymore.

463
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,004
Why can't I be?

464
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:12,088
Why?

465
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:16,343
A stray dog runs around the neighborhood
causing all kinds of trouble.

466
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:19,638
You're just a mutt
trying to hump every woman's leg.

467
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:20,889
Hey!

468
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:24,184
We wouldn't even give
a mutt like you rotten rice.

469
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:28,313
But you still want to be chief?
Stop crapping all over town!

470
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:32,233
Damn you!

471
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:36,404
Hey, come on.
Do you even know what happened?

472
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:38,531
What do you know?

473
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:43,286
She said she was just getting cramps
in her toes, so--

474
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:46,164
Well, your wife's getting cramps
in her heart.

475
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,124
"A great example"?

476
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,960
The candidate's "family problems,"
you say?

477
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,171
It's better for a candidate's son
to be a nutjob

478
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:54,839
than for a candidate to be.

479
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,550
He's actually pretty clever!

480
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:02,472
So what now?
Are you going to tell people about me?

481
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:04,891
Of course we are.

482
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:07,519
We are going to
so that Ae-sun can be chief.

483
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:08,561
That's right.

484
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:11,856
Hey, you. Is that what you stand for?

485
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:14,442
"Right to know."

486
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,319
"Morality."

487
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:19,114
<i>I'm not bashing anyone.</i>

488
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,949
I'm just discussing morality.

489
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,702
Don't you realize
people have the right to know?

490
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,453
Isn't that what you like?

491
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,206
Wow, Ae-sun.

492
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:30,959
Goddamn it!

493
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,300
This is so silly.

494
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:42,011
CONGRATULATIONS
THE 7TH DODONG-RI CHIEF, OH AE-SUN

495
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:45,807
Oh Ae-sun!

496
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,935
<i>The small ball that Ae-sun launched…</i>

497
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:51,396
Goodness me. Look at this!

498
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,814
Did the school lend this to us?

499
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,233
They only use it once a year
for sports day.

500
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,945
<i>…came back down, bursting open in half.</i>

501
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:00,447
<i>And Jeju had…</i>

502
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,364
Chief!

503
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:02,574
<i>…its first-ever female chief.</i>

504
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:05,493
Chief! Chief Oh!

505
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,245
Yes!

506
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:09,122
- The rice cake is here.
- It's here now?

507
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:13,209
- Chief Oh, we're out of <i>makgeolli</i>.
- Really?

508
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,128
Chief Oh.

509
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,504
Can I have a blanket?

510
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,797
Yes.

511
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:22,177
Chief! The school wants to know
when you'll return the confetti ball.

512
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:26,222
<i>It must have pulled at her heartstrings.</i>

513
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:33,062
<i>Many years later,</i>
<i>Mom joined Lim Young-woong's fan club,</i>

514
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,691
<i>and her username was "Chief Oh."</i>

515
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:40,695
Chief!

516
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:45,074
Chief, come over here
and have a taste. Come on!

517
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,075
Coming!

518
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:48,036
I'm coming!

519
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,547
- Go ahead and take that.
- Okay.

520
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:09,682
{\an8}THE 5TH AND 6TH FISHING CO-OP CHIEF
BU SANG-GIL

521
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,572
Are we ever getting any meat?

522
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,908
Are you saving it up or something?

523
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:30,829
Why would you come all the way
just to be grumpy?

524
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,623
A predecessor would never miss
an inauguration ceremony.

525
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:37,585
I'm the former king who's here to check
on a nobody who knows jack shit.

526
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:41,005
You came because you'd look petty
if you didn't.

527
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:43,842
I've resigned.

528
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,177
I stepped down myself.

529
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:50,849
You know the 80-year-old grandpa
who owns the variety shop?

530
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,811
He hardly ever says anything,

531
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:59,315
but he asked if I knew about Sang-gil
massaging the real estate agent's feet.

532
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:04,529
Come on! She had toe cramps!

533
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:07,407
I had to save the person first!

534
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:23,673
Looks like I'll have to serve
my chief daughter-in-law for life.

535
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:27,343
Thanks to her meddling,
the family's full of officials.

536
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:30,179
If she's the chief,
Gwan-sik's like a king consort.

537
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,765
That'd make me the queen mother, right?

538
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:36,102
My goodness, she is making a fuss again.

539
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:40,231
She's something else.
Her luck changed after meeting Gwan-sik.

540
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,775
You're bragging, aren't you?

541
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,777
Bragging?

542
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:48,364
On that note,
I hear your daughter-in-law plays cards<i>.</i>

543
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,325
Hey, that's…

544
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,994
Isn't the <i>pajeon </i>ready yet?

545
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:55,371
Our First Lady sure is busy.

546
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,081
Don't call him the First Lady.

547
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,419
Hey, why can't you take that apron off?

548
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:02,754
- Mom.
- What?

549
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:04,631
Make them bigger.

550
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,175
Damn it.

551
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:10,887
He's really pissing me off.

552
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:16,935
You like that your daughter-in-law
is the chief, but you also don't like it.

553
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:18,770
What's so funny?

554
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:21,230
I don't think I've seen you before.

555
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:22,398
- You know me?
- Chief Oh.

556
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,025
Yes, I'm coming!

557
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,485
Chief Oh is on her way!

558
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:32,617
- Oh my!
- Why are you so surprised?

559
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,161
Like you've never made me
work for you before?

560
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:38,247
Is this revenge?
You're taking your revenge on me, right?

561
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:41,084
Isn't there any respect around here?

562
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,001
Unbelievable.

563
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:45,588
How could you let the wife
of my predecessor make <i>jeon </i>here?

564
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:53,554
I'm telling you,
Bu Sang-gil was massaging her feet!

565
00:32:57,141 --> 00:33:00,979
As you know, during election campaigns,

566
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,982
people bring up all sorts of things,

567
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:07,652
like how someone's great-grandfather
used to have a mistress and all that.

568
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:10,446
Like how I used to go dancing?

569
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,198
You never brought that up.

570
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:20,081
It wasn't my intention, but I feel like
I've caused a stir in your household.

571
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:26,838
But we took care of
the real estate woman ourselves.

572
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:28,840
I couldn't care less.

573
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,802
Gyeong-suk from the salon
and Mi-suk from the real estate office.

574
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:34,971
On this tiny island,

575
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:38,057
there are so many women
with such poor taste in men.

576
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:44,313
Well, I guess the worst of them
is me, Park Yeong-ran.

577
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:50,361
Anyway, you should go.

578
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:53,197
Some people just gossip
for no good reason.

579
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,575
Do you think they'll say
I have no dignity?

580
00:33:56,451 --> 00:34:02,373
No, but I feel kind of sorry
that you're making <i>jeon </i>for us.

581
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:05,251
I have a reason to be here.

582
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,670
I have every right to be here.

583
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,049
I voted for you,

584
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:17,638
so I think I should be able to enjoy
a drink you provide.

585
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:22,393
Yeong-ran.

586
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:27,356
When you go home,
no, for the rest of your life,

587
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,318
tell your husband
that you voted for him, okay?

588
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:33,613
<i>Hey, Park Yeong-ran!</i>

589
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:35,406
<i>I'm asking who you voted for!</i>

590
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:48,920
Why can't you answer me?
You didn't vote for me, did you?

591
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:51,255
Is Mom the easiest target in the world?

592
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,341
Hey, you little brat.

593
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,468
Are you disrespecting me?
What do you know?

594
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:58,554
You don't even know a damn thing.

595
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:03,893
Why?

596
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:06,771
Why?

597
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:09,690
Why did the governor attend?

598
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:13,236
Why did he come
to the co-op chief's inauguration?

599
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:14,779
He didn't come to mine.

600
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,114
The governor came?

601
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:20,993
It was the governor who presented Gwan-sik
with the plaque of appreciation.

602
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:22,662
A person who jumped into the water?

603
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:26,833
If I saw them,
I would save them countless times too.

604
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:29,210
I'd receive a commendation!

605
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:33,464
That thing about the reward?
And he's sending them on a trip too?

606
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:37,844
The governor likes Gwan-sik.

607
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:39,887
He's very fond of him.

608
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:44,058
Of course he likes Gwan-sik.

609
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,186
I'm sure he does.

610
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:50,189
Why?

611
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:55,069
Why does everyone like Yang Gwan-sik?

612
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,655
GOVERNOR HWANG IN-SU
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR INAUGURATION

613
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:05,121
If your grandmother were here,
she would've thrown a box of red beans.

614
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:24,223
What the hell are you doing?

615
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:25,266
Hey!

616
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:26,893
Come here!

617
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:28,060
You fool!

618
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,354
You're so embarrassing.

619
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,905
You gotta stop her.
She's really getting out of hand.

620
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,204
Man, she really loves Busan.

621
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,623
She always calls herself Literary Girl.

622
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:51,500
You're no bookworm! You're just a worm!

623
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,093
Look, she's dancing with the pole.

624
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,930
Throw red beans at her! Throw them!

625
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:12,605
Father!

626
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,608
Let her be. Let her have her fun.

627
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:19,779
It's a good thing I started raising you.

628
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:21,906
Let's go, my good boy.

629
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,242
Where's Goldie?

630
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:25,743
Come on, my Goldie.

631
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:30,414
Oh dear, let's go home, my good boy.

632
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:42,969
Father.

633
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:44,887
I'll carry her.

634
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:46,597
Are you that happy?

635
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:48,891
Yeah.

636
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:50,476
I'm happy.

637
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:54,730
I'm so happy.

638
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:59,694
You're not a runner-up, a vice president,
or a deputy chief anymore.

639
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:01,904
You really are a chief.

640
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:05,449
But you know,

641
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:10,288
I finally got rid of the "deputy"
in my title after 30 years,

642
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:15,042
but the person I want to tell the most
isn't here.

643
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:25,011
My childhood was so difficult
that I never missed it.

644
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:29,181
But if I was asked to go back…

645
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:33,519
I'd do it all over again.

646
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:36,397
Just so I could hold

647
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,233
<i>my mom's hand again.</i>

648
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:43,654
Actually, the reason
I'm the vice president and a runner-up now

649
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:46,615
is because I wanna be the chief one day.

650
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:48,284
Even with diving,

651
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:51,203
you start in shallow waters
before moving to deeper ones.

652
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,708
I'll gain experience little by little
and become a chief one day.

653
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:58,336
No one can beat a chief.

654
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:02,590
Even Auntie Gyeong-ja
repays her loans to the chief.

655
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:06,719
Okay, you be the chief one day
so I can be the chief's mother.

656
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:09,972
Prepare enough rice cakes that day.

657
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:14,268
I'm going to make so many rice cakes
that they'll pile up like that mountain.

658
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,812
- Because you'd be happy?
- Yes, I'd be happy.

659
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,314
I'd be happy too.

660
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:21,734
I'm holding back

661
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:25,071
because I want to express
my happiness that day.

662
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:30,368
I'm not going to hold back.

663
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:33,579
Every time I'm really happy,
I'll let everyone know.

664
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:34,497
Why hold back?

665
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,461
Aunties, make sure
you take double portions, all right?

666
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:43,422
Goodness me.

667
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:48,302
You all fed and raised me
with these red-ribboned nets.

668
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:51,263
Now go around and brag about me
on my mom's behalf.

669
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,432
Honestly.

670
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,643
You must've used a ton of rice.

671
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,561
Why did you make so many rice cakes?

672
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:01,649
Apparently, this is from our Gwang-rye!

673
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:03,526
Oh dear.

674
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,361
Gwang-rye!

675
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:09,615
Your daughter is all grown up.
She's the chief now.

676
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:15,287
She was only ten when she sat
on this very floor in mourning clothes.

677
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:20,209
Back then,
I wondered whether she'd make it.

678
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:24,088
Who knew she would not only survive
but also thrive?

679
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:25,714
If Gwang-rye were still with us,

680
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:29,885
she would have taken a drum
and played it all around Hallasan.

681
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:33,180
You dug into the frozen ground
with your tiny hands

682
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,974
and buried your heart in it.

683
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:37,268
This must be your harvest season at last.

684
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:43,983
Gwang-rye's persimmon tree is fruitful.
So fruitful!

685
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:46,152
<i>Indeed,</i>

686
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:48,320
<i>it was fall, the season of harvest,</i>

687
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:52,783
<i>when all kinds of fruits were ripening.</i>

688
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:09,633
<i>Each one filled</i>
<i>with its own chaotic story.</i>

689
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:15,181
<i>Each one growing</i>
<i>under its own ray of sunlight.</i>

690
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:25,566
Hey, look.

691
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:35,701
Why?

692
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:37,453
Sorry?

693
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,371
Why are you in the front seat again?

694
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:42,625
Just because

695
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,294
it's fun.

696
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:49,840
It really annoys her

697
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,260
when I do that.

698
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,054
That mean girl you told me about?

699
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:55,971
Yes.

700
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:56,889
Yeong-beom!

701
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:03,479
Yeong-beom.

702
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,410
<i>Jjajangmyeon </i>was all you wanted?

703
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,914
So you don't know that car either?

704
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:24,833
There's something really weird
about Yang Geum-myeong, right?

705
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:26,710
Stop saying weird things.

706
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,630
Not all poor people lack class.

707
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:32,216
Ye-rim, stop taking her side.

708
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:35,761
She's always mean to you,
so why are you always so nice to her?

709
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:39,431
It's because her mind is twisted.
I can understand her.

710
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:41,100
What do you mean she's twisted?

711
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:45,563
My dad and I had a little talk
about Geum-myeong.

712
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:48,983
He said those who rise from nothing
often get twisted.

713
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,652
She must've been the best
in her tiny town.

714
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:54,655
But it's different here,
so her mind must be twisted.

715
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:58,450
She feels more inferior every day.

716
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,703
Dad says the better person
should let it go.

717
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:02,454
That's what class is.

718
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:03,372
But…

719
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:07,042
why would she be like that?

720
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:09,461
Her GPA is higher than yours.

721
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,547
By 0.2. Just a 0.2 difference.

722
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,048
- She's taller too.
- By 2 cm?

723
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:14,133
And…

724
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:17,886
You must remember everything about her.

725
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,889
- What else?
- Anyway…

726
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:22,433
Don't "anyway" me. What else?

727
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:27,396
Anyway, Geum-myeong was
the first chosen to go to Japan.

728
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:31,191
If she hadn't given it up,
you wouldn't be going, but thanks to her--

729
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,611
If I were a professor,
I would have chosen her too.

730
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:36,113
My family can afford to send me abroad.

731
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:39,617
Naturally, the school would support
a less fortunate girl.

732
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,534
Ye-rim.

733
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,620
Geum-myeong's family is doing well.

734
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,872
- Her father's a boat captain.
- He's a fisherman.

735
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,582
Birds of a feather flock together!

736
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:49,668
You sure are classy.

737
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:53,422
I'm not gonna eat.

738
00:43:58,093 --> 00:43:59,762
She dumped you, didn't she?

739
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:02,264
What's with that foreign car? Tell me!

740
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:05,184
You're just dying to know, aren't you?

741
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:08,771

00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:17,154
Will the waves be safe today?

744
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:23,243
Regardless of whether the waves are safe,
my dad still takes his boat out.

745
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:27,539
I'm the only one
who always worries about him.

746
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:30,000
- I'll see you guys.
- Bye.

747
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,053
Okay, let's go!

748
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:43,639
Speak with respect!

749
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:48,185
"Shut the fuck"? Jesus Christ.

750
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:51,897
You can't even spell "Wednesday."
Where'd you learn to curse?

751
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:57,569
Jenny, can you spell "Wednesday" now?

752
00:44:57,653 --> 00:45:00,030
- Write it down here. Now.
- Don't.

753
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:04,410
Why is your name even Oh Jenny?

754
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:06,662
I was scared you were from overseas.

755
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:09,415
Anyone else would've been fired by now.

756
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:10,874
Not just fired but--

757
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,501
Just fire me already.

758
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:17,506
Actually, why don't you fire me?
I heard no other tutor lasted a month.

759
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:19,216
Well, look forward to it.

760
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:21,719
Put your feet down!

761
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:24,388
Seriously!

762
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:36,984
Hey, Oh Jammy. You didn't memorize
the vocabulary, did you?

763
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,862
You just come here to eat, don't you?

764
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:44,491
I think your housekeeper can cook dishes
from all over the country.

765
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,785
She said these glass noodles
are from Busan.

766
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:50,122
That lady always uses
other people's money to gain favor.

767
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,626
You're such a brat
that she might quit here soon too.

768
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:58,505
She's been here the longest.
Mom keeps her for some reason.

769
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:04,219
People don't stay at your house
for very long, do they?

770
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:05,971
Why?

771
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:09,057
Come on, why?

772
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:12,853
Well,

773
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:18,400
why haven't I ever met
your mother and father?

774
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:20,319
But that's better, isn't it?

775
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:23,113
Well, I'd like to see their faces
at least once.

776
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,990
Mom saw you. Just not at home.

777
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,451
Your mom saw me?

778
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:28,577
Where?

779
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,454
You had your picture on your résumé.

780
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,372
Just fill the time and go.

781
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:35,459
Honestly, you're here for the jar,
not 'cause you like me.

782
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:37,544
For you, it's love-hate.

783
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,546
For the jar, it's pure love.

784
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:43,967
Can you do something about your bangs
and how you part your hair?

785
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:46,345
You don't look like you're from Seoul!

786
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:49,097
Why are you so interested in my hairstyle?

787
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:53,018
I mean, do you and I really look alike?

788
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:53,936
What?

789
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:57,147
I'm the sexier one, right?

790
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,650
"Sexy"? Did you just say sexy?

791
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:01,985
Hey!

792
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:03,987
Spell "sexy" right here. Spell it.

793
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:06,532
I can spell that one. S-E--

794
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:07,449
Stop it.

795
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:11,078
- S-E!
- Stop it!

796
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:12,871
Is that all you're interested in?

797
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,998
How dare you. Seriously.

798
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:28,387
Mom said take what you earned.
No more, no less.

799
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:36,728
Your mother always puts me
to the test every single time.

800
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:50,200
Hello? Yeah, what?

801
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:51,827
Just grab a handful.

802
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:53,579
Charge double for a dumb student.

803
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:56,164
What is it?

804
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:01,086
My mom's coming up. She wants to see you.

805
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:03,881
- What? Right now?
- Just go.

806
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:07,509
I said just go.

807
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:34,244
Ms. Yang.

808
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,455
That's real white porcelain.

809
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:42,419
I have everything now.

810
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:45,047
I even have white porcelain
and blue porcelain at home.

811
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:48,759
The one thing we don't have
is a good education.

812
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:51,803
I see.

813
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:54,556
I deeply regret
the limited education I had.

814
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,600
I wanted to live vicariously
through my child,

815
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:59,186
but sadly, she inherited my intellect.

816
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:05,525
We'll improve her grades gradually.

817
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:09,154
We can't afford to wait
for them to improve gradually.

818
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:11,448
Life doesn't wait for anyone, does it?

819
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:13,533
I see.

820
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:17,245
Are you saying I should stop coming…

821
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:19,873
Jenny is rich,
but she doesn't have the brains.

822
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:22,626
You earned your way through school,
but you're smart.

823
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:24,670
I'm saying we should share what we have.

824
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:29,341
I'll give you an ace

825
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:31,802
so you can hit a blackjack.

826
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:35,931
It took us two years to find a tutor
who looked like Jenny.

827
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:37,641
I won't beat around the bush.

828
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:39,267
Ms. Yang.

829
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:42,312
Please take her college entrance exam.

830

831
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:07,838
If she gets into
one of the top three universities,

832
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:10,298
I'll buy you
a three-bed apartment in Seoul.

833
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:12,843
For anything less, a two-bed instead.

834

If a name isn't on the list,
can't they live in the dorms?

836
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:29,776
No.

837
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:33,947
I wonder how much the rent is

838
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:36,575
for boarding houses here.

839
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:39,703
It's expensive.

840
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:41,830
It'll be expensive.

841
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:11,318
Is he picking a fight or what?

842
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:15,822
<i>The day of this historic election,</i>
<i>December 16th, is upon us,</i>

843
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:18,325
<i>with the eyes of the world closely on us.</i>

844
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:21,787
<i>It's been 16 years</i>
<i>since we last voted freely for president.</i>

845
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:24,122
<i>The atmosphere was solemn and serious.</i>

846
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:28,251
They say dorm assignments
are drawn at random,

847
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:30,253
but I think something is fishy.

848
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:34,800
{\an8}Apparently, South Korea is one
of the most corrupt countries.

849
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:39,096
So, who are you voting for?

850
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:43,850
I think we need to call
the military police to take him.

851
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,603
- What?
- Why is a soldier near the girls' dorm?

852
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:49,689
The guys' dorms are nearby.

853
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,193
They come and go while on their leave.

854
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:57,114
Who did you vote for?

855
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:01,868
Can we get him locked up in the brig?

856
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:10,168
One, two, three.

857
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:18,218
Hello, Father!

858
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:27,060
Well, we met once
at the admission ceremony.

859
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:31,064
My name is Park Yeong-beom.
I'm a friend of Geum-myeong.

860
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:41,658
I also took a few pictures
of your family that day, and…

861
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:49,875
So, you must have taken a plane
and then a bus to see Geum-myeong.

862
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:52,377
So why?

863
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:55,130
- Sir?
- Why would you call me "Father"?

864
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:58,216
- Sorry?
- You said, "Hello, Father."

865
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,594
Why did you call me "Father"?
For what reason?

866
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,012
TEST IDENTIFICATION SLIP
OH JENNY

867
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:02,929
Dear me.

868
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:05,307
Oh dear.

869
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:09,769
Ma'am, we could get into
serious trouble doing this.

870
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:13,857
Tutoring is already illegal,
so my heart races every time I come here.

871
00:53:15,066 --> 00:53:18,028
Your heart needs to race
to make some money.

872
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:20,822
There's no jackpot
if you don't bet on anything.

873
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:22,949
If I got caught, I'd be expelled.

874
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:27,871
Exactly, the high risk of expulsion
is why you'd get an apartment.

875
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:34,336
The exam isn't a joke.
How could I ever be Jenny?

876
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:38,840
Whoever the proctor is,
I will offer them a bribe.

877
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:44,054
I'll have everything set up perfectly
so you won't have to worry about a thing.

878
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:50,602
You earn money
by doing what you're good at.

879
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:53,146
I'll support you
by doing what I'm good at.

880
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,273
Isn't it fair, proper, and profitable

881
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:57,525
to earn a living
by doing what you're good at?

882
00:53:58,526 --> 00:54:01,905
Just take the plunge this once
and grab the ace.

883
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,243
Ma'am, the thing is--

884
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:07,160
No.

885
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:09,746
I don't want your answer now.

886
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:11,539
Think carefully.

887
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:14,251
Think very carefully before you speak.

888
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:24,427
You didn't get a scholarship,
and you have to leave the dorms, right?

889
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,429
Are you really giving up
on studying abroad?

890
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:29,307
How do you know all that?

891
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:31,101
Like I said, think carefully.

892
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,979
Don't just think about yourself.

893
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:37,023
Think of your parents
who work so hard for you.

894
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:40,360
For a dragon to really rise from a stream,

895
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:44,114
the stream has to dry up, right?

896
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:47,659
Come with me.

897
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:50,620
Hey! Go to your room.

898
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,086
Young lady!

899
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:01,089
Young lady! Wait up!

900
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:02,924
Goodness me.

901
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:05,677
Did you come out of unit 908?

902
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:08,346
Sorry? Why did you…

903
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:09,556
If you run,

904
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:12,100
I can't catch up with you.

905
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:14,185
Why would I run?

906
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:15,895
You stole something from there, no?

907
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:17,355
Sorry?

908
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:21,484
Just give it here.
Let's not make this any worse.

909
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:27,115
Is that what that lady said?

910
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:31,536
I don't want to hear your answer now.

911
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:33,830
Just take these with you.

912
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:37,667
Look at them two or three times
or even more.

913
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:38,835
Then we'll talk again.

914
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:44,758
Frankly, trying to rise as a dragon
from a stream is selfish, you know?

915
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:48,553
You'd think the dragon
would give back to its parents,

916
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:50,138
but just think about it.

917
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:53,558
Your father is still on that boat
because of you.

918
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:56,853
And he'll stay on that boat
for the rest of his life.

919
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:04,861
My father also trusted his eldest son,
who said he'd take the bar exam,

920
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:08,031
and he fed his cows until the day he died.

921
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:14,579
If I think of my mom and dad,
there's nothing more for me to ponder.

922
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:17,916
It'd be great for me to earn an apartment
by doing what I'm good at.

923
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:20,543
Yes. I like that you're so frank.

924
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:22,837
But thinking of my mom and dad,
I can't do it.

925
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:24,381
What?

926
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:27,717
I was taught to be the last in my class
rather than cheat.

927
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:32,013
I was taught not to even pick up
a ten-won coin at the playground.

928
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:35,892
My mom and dad would never approve
of me living life shamelessly.

929
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:39,104
Are you trying to tell me something?

930
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:40,230
Also,

931
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:43,858
if I take the test for Jenny
and she happens to get accepted,

932
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:45,819
another girl like me won't make it.

933
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:49,447
I can't bear the thought
of a girl like me not making it

934
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:51,991
because of a fraud.

935
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:54,452
She'd die of heartbreak.

936
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:56,746
Ms. Yang Geum-myeong.

937
00:56:57,414 --> 00:57:01,668
When you have resources and act nobly,
you are seen as a person of integrity.

938
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:05,004
But when a poor girl pretends to be noble,
it's deemed reckless courage.

939
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:09,551
Sending a girl who can't spell "Wednesday"
to a top-three school would be reckless--

940
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:11,177
- Reckless courage.
- Hey!

941
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:16,349
Let Jenny find her path
by doing what she's good at.

942
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:19,769
Isn't that fair, proper,
and profitable for Jenny?

943
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:22,188
Yeah, I want to be a singer.

944
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:28,570
I'll be going now.

945
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:33,700
This is why I hate
people who rise from nothing.

946
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:39,372
You have absolutely nothing,
yet pride is all you have to show off!

947
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:43,460
Dumb and rude, so it should be quadruple.

948
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:48,548
I'll take my extra pay, then.

949
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:07,734
I'm not a thief.

950
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:10,612
I know. It's not fear
that makes people avoid her.

951
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:13,364
It’s my money,
but I'll give it up just to avoid them.

952
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:17,535
And the ring?

953
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:19,120
Sorry?

954
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:21,456
Diamond. The diamond ring.

955
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:38,389
<i>They wished every day</i>

956
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:42,769
<i>that the world beyond their embrace</i>
<i>would always be gentle.</i>

957
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:44,437
Ma'am!

958
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:47,482
Ma'am!

959
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:50,235
Hey! Oh Jammy!

960
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:52,278
Hey, open the door!

961
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:59,202
Hey! Why am I a thief? Why?

962
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:01,871
<i>But the world away from their embrace</i>

963
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:04,374
<i>was a jungle.</i>

964
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:55,962
"IN THE HOPE THAT OUR ECHOES
WILL FLOW AND FLOW, UNTIL THEY REACH YOU."

965
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:05,346
