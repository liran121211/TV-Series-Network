1
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,982
WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU TANGERINES

2
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:09,736
DAECHI POLICE

3
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:21,539
Are you a lord?

4
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:22,832
Are you the judge?

5
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:26,461
If you hit us, must we take it?
If you send us to Namsan, must we go?

6
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:30,131
If you say I'm a thief, am I one?
If you send me to jail, must I go?

7
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,967
The ring next to the porcelain jar.
The diamond ring.

8
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,846
I've never even seen a diamond ring!

9
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,057
It's not here.

10
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:42,644
Who was that female officer?
Was it Yeon-sun?

11
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,687
Tell her to come here
and search this girl.

12
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:45,688
Yes, sir.

13
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:49,609
Why would anyone need to search me?
I'm not a thief!

14
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:51,820
See? You must really be hiding something.

15
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:55,990
The lady's been turning a blind eye
to this girl taking money from a jar.

16
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,785
- No, I earned that--
- How did you earn it?

17
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,371
You're an illegal tutor, right?

18
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:06,126
The lady let the girl handle bookkeeping
and overlooked her stealing

19
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,919
because she was a working student.

20
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,131
Do all poor people steal, then?

21
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:14,425
Some people wouldn't steal
even if beaten into it.

22
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,177
Let us search you, then.

23
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,388
Why do I have to?

24
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,598
I'm not a thief! Why should I have to…

25
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,016
Something's off about you.

26
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,145
What's your home phone number?
I need to see your father.

27
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:28,940
Why do you need to see my father?
I'm not a thief!

28
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:32,735
If you have nothing to hide, call him.
Acting like this is a sign of guilt!

29
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,905
If I tell my father
I'm suspected of being a thief,

30
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,158
it will tear his heart apart!

31
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:55,258
- All buses to the dorms stop here--
- I get it. Leave.

32
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,595
- I'm waiting for my bus home…
- Not heading to the base?

33
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:02,265
- I'm on leave until Friday.
- Go back early, then.

34
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,391
Sorry?

35
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,852
Don't you dare date Geum-myeong. Got it?

36
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,689
Why won't you answer?

37
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:17,572
Are you two…

38
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:20,742
dating?

39
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,536
Are you testing me?

40
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:29,000
- I got dumped.
- Dumped? You?

41
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,543
I always get dumped.

42
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:39,177
You're chasing girls instead of studying.
That's why you always get dumped.

43
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:43,014
Did your dad tell you
to date around in college?

44
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:44,807
It's not that.

45
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,061
I was dumped eight times by Geum-myeong.

46
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,362
Do you want one or something?

47
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:59,697
It's okay. You should have it, Father.

48
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,160
Well, Mr. Yang.

49
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,621
Have a safe trip back.

50
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,331
But why?

51
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,251
Why doesn't she like you?

52
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:16,965
I just think--

53
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,801
It's because you're too…
You're too… You know?

54
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:23,221
- You're dead meat.
- It's not that--

55
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:25,932
She grew up watching me,
so her standards are high.

56
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:29,560
Up until she turned five,
she said she'd marry me when she grew up.

57
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,312
That's why you don't cut it.

58
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,022
So just move on with your life.

59
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,357
There's a lid for every pot.

60
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,568
The reason we're on and off is--

61
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,404
What does "on and off" even mean?

62
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,281
- Well…
- What?

63
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:47,161
She says I'm as quiet as a mouse
and that I'm not saying anything…

64
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:53,418
You're as quiet as a mouse.
Why aren't you saying anything?

65
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:54,419
<i>To be ready.</i>

66
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:57,338
<i>- You have the ring on, so that's it.</i>
<i>- Ready, go.</i>

67
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:06,889
Well,

68
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,976
since you offered…

69
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:14,647
No.

70
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,318
Go away.

71
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,375
You lied about the ring?

72
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,338
She didn't take it, did she?

73
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,554
Goodness gracious.

74
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:50,433
Why send her to the police?
You usually just frame them and fire them.

75
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,561
Who would believe a thief?

76
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,271
We need to make it seem like

77
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,649
she's spewing nonsense
because she's accused of being a thief

78
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,318
to avoid any trouble later.

79
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,445
If she starts a rumor

80
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:06,032
that Oh Jenny from Daechi-dong
is looking for someone to take her exam,

81
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,825
you and I will be in deep shit.

82
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,454
My ring was stolen,
and that girl is the thief.

83
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,629
I always tell you, don't I?

84
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,215
Life is all about betting big
or going bust.

85
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,760
Whether I'll crush or be crushed,

86
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:28,096
that's a split-second decision.

87
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:32,517
There's no need to pity those
whose wells have run dry.

88
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:36,687
Don't be swayed by petty sentiments.
You need to be cold.

89
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:39,148
That's how I made my money.

90
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:44,737
So keep making good money.
You'll be in for it if your well runs dry.

91
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:46,572
What?

92
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:48,324
I take after you.

93
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:56,082
You're saying
she stole the flower-shaped ring

94
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,626
that's always here, right?

95
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:00,128
Yeah.

96
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,338
How dare she.

97
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,092
- It's a diamond.
- Yes. Diamond.

98
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,178
How many carats was it?

99
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,389
About half a carat?

100
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,016
Was it half a carat?

101
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,476
It was expensive.

102
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,437
Flower-shaped.

103
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,689
Yes, flower-shaped. Seriously!

104
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,524
What would you even know?

105
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,026
Oh dear, here it is.

106
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,945
It's right over

107
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,030
here.

108
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,368
It just naturally rolled here on its own.

109
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:39,125
You should call the police, shouldn't you?

110
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,501
Lady, what are you doing?

111
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,463
Call the police
and let them know you found the ring.

112
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,548
Apologize for the mix-up.

113
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,633
I'm asking you what you're doing.

114
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,761
You won't call them?

115
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:54,891
Lady!

116
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,689
If you don't, I'll throw it away.

117
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:04,650
You're out of your mind!

118
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,986
Do you have any idea
how expensive that was?

119
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:10,072
- Come on! Seriously!
- You've lost it anyway, right?

120
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,284
You said it was stolen
and that the girl was the thief.

121
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:16,412
And now you're going to report
that I've thrown it away?

122
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,539
Damn it!

123
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:19,540
Put it down!

124
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:22,418
Don't you know me? I would throw this.

125
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,837
Very far, in fact.

126
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,255
- I'll--
- Hey!

127
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,594
That ring is worth more than you are!

128
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,179
Call them.

129
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,433
Stay out of my fucking business.

130
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,477
Apologize.

131
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,646
Who do you think you are? Stay out of it!

132
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:42,855
Do you know her?

133
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:46,943
- I do.
- Seriously! You're driving me insane.

134
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,819
Call them now!

135
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:01,457
Hello?

136
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,878
What now? Asking for money again?
We don't have any.

137
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:09,549
Hey, Geum-myeong's mom!

138
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,676
- Your daughter called!
- Okay.

139
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,512
My baby! Oh my!

140
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:15,680
"Baby"? Seriously?

141
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:20,518
- Baby! Where are you?
- Baby's somewhere spending money!

142
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:24,063
<i>I wanted to cry like a baby</i>

143
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:26,440
<i>and tell her that people in Seoul</i>
<i>were really evil.</i>

144
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,192
<i>Baby, have you eaten?</i>

145
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:33,072
<i>But that single sentence full of worries</i>
<i>left me speechless.</i>

146
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,907
Who hasn't eaten by now?

147
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:36,784
<i>My heart melted.</i>

148
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,704
No, I called just because.

149
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,082
Can't I call just because I feel like it?

150
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,127
I do.

151
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,547
I have money.

152
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:55,386
What about you? Is everything okay?

153
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:01,601
Didn't I tell you to stop setting up
that stall on the street?

154
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:05,479
<i>I told you I hate</i>
<i>that you eat out on the street every day!</i>

155
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:09,025
Those damn abalones! Seriously!

156
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:12,612
<i>Is abalone season that important?</i>
<i>You always say your back hurts.</i>

157
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:15,531
<i>Just open a store or something!</i>

158
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,159
You need money to open a store.

159
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:19,827
Mom.

160
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,749
Why don't you ever have any money?

161
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,128
I know, right?

162
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,631
Why don't I ever have any money?

163
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,924
Because of you!

164
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,303
<i>I was mad at my mom for being poor.</i>

165
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,723
<i>I was mad because I knew I was the reason.</i>

166
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,186
Baby, Dad hasn't arrived yet, has he?

167
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,396
<i>You didn't call</i>
<i>because you met him, did you?</i>

168
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,314
Dad?

169
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:51,233
Dad received a reward
for saving that person from drowning.

170
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,444
<i>I told you it was happening today.</i>

171
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:58,658
<i>The governor sent a group of co-op members</i>
<i>to the mainland to go sightseeing.</i>

172
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:03,371
<i>He gave them museum tickets</i>
<i>because a new one opened.</i>

173
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,122
Where on the mainland? Which museum?

174
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:08,084
He wants to see you
if he can find the time.

175
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,377
Where on the mainland?

176
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:14,131
On the mainland.
You know, the museum that just opened.

177
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,760
<i>You always just say "the mainland."</i>
<i>How am I supposed to know where that is?</i>

178
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,721
Which museum is he coming to?

179
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,307
He'll visit if he can find the time?
I'm busy too!

180
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:27,061
So is Dad coming or not?

181
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:28,729
<i>Geum-myeong.</i>

182
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,356
He'll be there.

183
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,400
Dad will be there.

184
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,699
- Kim Young-sam!
- Kim Dae-jung!

185
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,747
Gosh, the traffic is awful.

186
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,750
She's actually insane.

187
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,002
How can she accuse you of stealing?

188
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,047
So the cops called your house?

189
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:56,465
No.

190
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,802
I refused to give them
my home phone number.

191
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,810
- You're not gonna tell your family?
- How could I?

192
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:17,153
It's okay if the whole world knows,
as long as my mom and dad don't.

193
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,324
<i>Parents have no idea</i>

194
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,704
<i>of the moment</i>
<i>when their child's heart develops knots.</i>

195
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,208
<i>If they knew, they'd protect their child.</i>

196
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,089
<i>So God keeps it from them.</i>

197
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:45,306
<i>No tree grows without knots,</i>

198
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:50,311
<i>and a child's knots would carve a hole</i>
<i>in a father's heart,</i>

199
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,688
<i>so God keeps it hidden.</i>

200
00:12:58,944 --> 00:12:59,862
Goodness me.

201
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:03,073
You'll be the death of me.

202
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,242
I could've been really late!

203
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,578
It's cold. It gets colder at night.

204
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,122
How long have you been waiting for me?

205
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,166
All college students seem to cradle these.

206
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:14,168
What time did you get here?

207
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,130
Let's go. Come on.

208
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:23,594
Doesn't this bother you?
Why is your bag strap always twisted?

209
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,667
Did you come to Seoul to eat <i>jjamppong</i>?

210
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,585
Aren't we going to talk?

211
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,089
You drink too.

212
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,050
I can hold my booze.

213
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,977
Well, you're not into protests, are you?

214
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,229
What museum opened?

215
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,106
Where are you staying?

216
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,566
I just stopped by.

217
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:22,069
Tear gas is so painful.
The tears just won't stop.

218
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:25,531
Which subway line is it?
Can you get there by yourself?

219
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:26,657
Well,

220
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,994
you're not dating a soldier, are you?

221
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:31,912
You shouldn't date one.

222
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:36,917
Why even eat together if it's like this?
Let's just each talk on our own.

223
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,261
I quit my part-time job.

224
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,306
I was asked to leave the dorms.

225
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,933
I didn't get a scholarship.

226
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:57,855
It's all good.

227
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,321
This college is full of kids
who aced the state exam.

228
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,782
Basically, all the dragons from streams
have gathered in one puddle.

229
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,869
You can't always be the best.
No one's that perfect.

230
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:16,123
I wouldn't even share a lunch table
with those kinds of kids.

231
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,547
"A dragon from the stream."

232
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,675
Why do I dislike hearing that?

233
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:33,307
Who benefits if a dragon rises
from the stream?

234
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,226
Is it any good for the stream?

235
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,064
And what good is it for the dragon?

236
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,277
I was selected to study abroad.

237
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,614
But I just won't go.

238
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:56,538
I really hate
that Oh Ye-rim is taking my place.

239
00:15:58,749 --> 00:15:59,917
But I just won't go.

240
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,802
I want to study abroad too.

241
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,304
I don't want that damn part-time job.

242
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,556
I want to try everything.

243
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,893
But I'm not going to.

244
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,898
I'm just being greedy.

245
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,902
It's just me being selfish.

246
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:33,033
I want to soar higher and higher.

247
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,206
But something keeps holding me back.

248
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,084
Mom and I?

249
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:43,752
No.

250
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:46,964
Guilt.

251
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,592
The higher I want to soar…

252
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,806
the more guilt holds me back.

253
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:00,227
Why should I feel bad
for wanting to do something more?

254
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,774
It's so infuriating. I can't take it.

255
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:10,446
<i>All I ever wanted was to say I'm sorry,</i>

256
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:15,034
<i>but when those tender words left my lips,</i>
<i>they always turned into barbs.</i>

257
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,663
Geum-myeong.

258
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:21,832
What?

259
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,460
Do it.

260
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:26,795
Do it all.

261
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,966
I'm still here for you.

262
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:44,938
Geum-myeong,

263
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,940
tell your teacher

264
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:51,195
Dad will pay the school support fees
in three days.

265
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,452
I'm still here for you.

266
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:06,835
Am I a child?

267
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,797
Why do you keep picking out the squid
and giving it to me?

268
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:15,219
<i>For the first time in 16 years,</i>
<i>citizens voted in the election,</i>

269
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,137
<i>with 89.2% turnout…</i>

270
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,014
Find a safe place to stay.

271
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:22,392
No need to worry about the rent at all.

272
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,061
As for the money…

273
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:28,357
The waters are full of fish.
I can catch them all.

274
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:34,196
Don't date a soldier.
Don't drink hard liquor.

275
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:36,990
Don't go to protests.

276
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,868
Tear gas is extremely painful.
You can't stop crying.

277
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,413
<i>Reunification Democratic Party's</i>
<i>Kim Young-sam</i>

278
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,833
<i>voted with his wife, Son Myung-soon.</i>

279
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,460
The news is what scares me the most.

280
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,295
To be honest,

281
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,214
I know nothing.

282
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,383
I don't know anything.

283
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:58,720
But I can't sleep when I see
soldiers with batons on the news.

284
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:02,015
Just hearing about college kids
getting taken somewhere and beaten…

285
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:04,852
Oh man.

286
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,439
It sends shivers down my spine.

287
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,693
So, Geum-myeong,

288
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:14,820
if you can help it…

289
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:20,576
<i>Democratic Justice candidate Roh Tae-woo</i>
<i>is in the lead.</i>

290
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:24,454
<i>Under the slogan</i>
<i>"A great era of ordinary people…"</i>

291
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,331
It's so annoying.

292
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:28,208
What's wrong?

293
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:31,044
Did you vote for someone else?

294
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,714
You're annoying.

295
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,093
You're so annoying, Dad.

296
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,933
You call this just stopping by?

297
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,561
You think the whole mainland
is just one place?

298
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,612
<i>Democratic Justice Party's Roh Tae-woo…</i>

299
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,030
You can't come home often.

300
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,240
We're so far apart.

301
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,703
<i>Which museum is he coming to?</i>

302
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:07,539
<i>He'll visit if he can find the time?</i>
<i>I'm busy too!</i>

303
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,876
<i>So is Dad coming or not?</i>

304
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:16,173
<i>Geum-myeong, he'll be there.</i>
<i>Dad will be there.</i>

305
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:20,719
<i>When have you ever seen Dad</i>
<i>go sightseeing?</i>

306
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,973
<i>Even on New Year's or Korean Thanksgiving</i>,
<i>he's eager to take his boat out to sea.</i>

307
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,642
He just used this chance

308
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,852
<i>as an excuse to see you.</i>

309
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:33,273
But I've got my own things
to do, too, you know?

310
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:37,903
Dad went
because he really missed his eldest.

311
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:41,365
So Geum-myeong, when you see your dad…

312
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:44,117
YONGSAN INTERCITY BUS STATION

313
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,392
Why would he come all the way
from Cheonan to Seoul?

314
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:10,769
So annoying.

315
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,480
<i>So, Geum-myeong,</i>

316
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:17,234
<i>when you see your dad,</i>
<i>don't get annoyed with him.</i>

317
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:19,236
<i>Be sweet to your father, okay?</i>

318
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,613
<i>His love has been one-sided for 20 years.</i>

319
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,301
Catch a lot of fish!

320
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,469
Catch a lot of squids!

321
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,418
Goodness me,
I'm leaving that little thing behind.

322
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:22,424
<i>Because of his daughter who,</i>
<i>in his eyes, refused to grow up,</i>

323
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,926
<i>Dad thought he might again feel sorry…</i>

324
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,974
<i>for his forever little girl, Ae-sun.</i>

325
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,146
FROM YANG EUN-MYEONG (CLASS 2-7)

326
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,231
How can I put this?

327
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,651
I'm not good at things like this!

328
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,656
Tell the kids who bought the "S" letters
from you to return them.

329
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,409
Just give them the money
and take them back!

330
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,703
They keep saying
they don't have them anymore!

331
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,580
Do you know how much this scotch costs?

332
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:55,791
Do you know how long it takes
to earn this?

333
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:58,919
<i>Their fall was…</i>

334
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:00,837
Harvesting season, my foot.

335
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:04,007
<i>…not a season of harvest</i>
<i>but of being picked clean.</i>

336
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:07,677
You pick at me more and more as you age.
My fruit has been picked clean!

337
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:15,727
HR teacher, Sonata. Principal, Stellar.
Chinese teacher, Pony, right?

338
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:16,770
- Right?
- Yeah.

339
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,564
Oh, teacher.

340
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,108
Oh, hi.

341
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:23,985
Hello, sir.

342
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:26,363
Hello.

<i>It was fall when each was picked clean</i>
<i>of what had been sown.</i>

344

345
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,836
Is that girl your daughter or a relative?

346
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,171
What do you even know?

347
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,466
I know her.

348
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,051
Yes, I'm sure you do.

349
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,431
<i>- I don't need any more free stuff.</i>
<i>- That free stuff--</i>

350
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,891
If you get drunk, they'll rob you.

351
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,935
She said you'll melt like butter, right?

352
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:58,687
What are you saying?

353
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,064
Don't turn the lights off, no matter what.

354
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,983
That woman is a real thief.

355
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,985
If you fall asleep, she'll steal your bag.

356
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:07,988
Why tell me this?

357
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,740
- Sorry?
- Why are you telling me?

358
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,294
Why did you help me?

359
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,379
Why did you even bother?

360
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,256
Do you know me?

361
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,008
What am I to you?

362
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:30,427
Why?

363
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:32,262
Why?

364
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,515
It'd be upsetting.

365
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,894
It'd be upsetting
if your bag got stolen too.

366
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,022
Is that all?

367
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,567
It's better if none of us are upset.

368
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,075
{\an8}You're right.

369
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:57,496
{\an8}It's better if none of us are upset.

370
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,343
{\an8}It's better if none of us are upset.

371
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:14,596
It'd be upsetting
if the girl got wrongly accused of theft.

372
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:17,807
You might as well be Mother Teresa.

373
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:20,310
You don't know that girl.

374
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:21,645
Do you even know SNU?

375
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,815
You've always been so nosy.

376
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:28,443
I do know her.

377
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:31,655
She protected my mom's inheritance
when I was young.

378
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:34,282
That girl wasn't even born then!

379
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,827
- She's the spitting image of that girl.
- My goodness.

380
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:40,622
If you weren't my old bar boss,
I'd have already…

381
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:41,540
What?

382
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,459
You'd make me a thief and fire me too?

383
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:49,798
Miss Kim.

384
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:51,299
Ma'am.

385
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:55,720
Miss Kim.

386
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,431
Stop calling me "Miss Kim"
in front of my daughter.

387
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:02,227
Why live such a shameful life
if you're scared of your kid's judgment?

388
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,772
Your daughter is watching everything.

389
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:09,651
Damn it! I told you to throw away
the empty ones!

390
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,655
Live a life of virtue, I'm telling you.

391
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,574
The parents' virtues and karma

392
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,909
go straight to the child.

393
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:19,661
Look at her.

394
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:21,496
You can tell

395
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,915
she's already on the wrong path.

396
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,084
I know.

397
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:39,764
<i>My mom made me do it.</i>

398
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:45,395
SEOUL STATION

399
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,784
How can I leave when you look like this?

400
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:02,287
Then don't leave!

401
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:07,584
Are we back together, then?

402
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:11,588
I don't know. Just stay still for now.

403
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:14,841
Stop breaking my heart.
I might end up becoming a deserter.

404
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:17,594
How many days are left?

405
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:19,929
797 days.

406
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:26,353
I hate North Korea so much!

407
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:29,564
I can't do much
about our on-and-off relationship.

408
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,733
But just marry me in the end, okay?

409
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:33,568
It depends.

410
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:35,445
On how well you do.

411
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:37,155
You said you'd marry me last time.

412
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:40,241
Hey, who knows what will happen?

413
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:43,912
They say you don't know
until you walk down the aisle.

414
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,331
Just wait and see.

415
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,708
I'll see you in a wedding dress.

416
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,169
<i>I truly believed I was different from Mom.</i>

417
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:53,213
Hey, are you getting on or what?

418
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,800
<i>In the end,</i>
<i>it was like mother, like daughter,</i>

419
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:59,260
<i>though not entirely.</i>

420
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,059
The bride will now enter
and walk down the aisle.

421
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:09,312
Geum-myeong.

422
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,732
Dad's still right here.

423
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,819
Just do everything you want to do.

424
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,461
<i>Mom's love was a fairy tale.</i>

425
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,505
Please welcome the bride.

426
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:43,972

I told you not to sit next to me.

Go back to your side!

441
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:16,064
What's an athlete doing
in the writing contest? Who sent you here?

442
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:19,567
I raised my hand
and said I wanted to enter.

443
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,946
You know what they say around town?

444
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:26,908
They say Gwan-sik wakes up
just to follow Ae-sun around.

445
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:29,327
I think you'll be the winner this time.

I think you'll be a great poet.

447
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,208
A great poet.

448
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,128
- Really?
- Yes.

449
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,173
What would you know?

450
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:44,342
I don't.

451
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,177
I can't write.

452
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,191
I should write to the Ministry.

453
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,694
They need to make athletes study too.

454
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:04,612
Will they take responsibility
for this kid's life?

Erase the moth. Why did you draw it here?

00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:13,204
It's a butterfly.

460
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:15,874
Write a poem for me too.

461
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,127
Titled "Yang Gwan-sik."

I'm not in high school anymore.

470
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:11,137
The paper was lying on the ground,
so I scribbled a few lines.

471
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,556
I still think you should submit it.

472
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,642
Submit what? Forget it.

473
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:19,896
Tomorrow's sports day is canceled too.

474
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:20,855
Why?

475
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:24,067
They're rehearsing for the Olympics too.

476
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:28,655
We earn the most on sports days.

477
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:32,951
We should set up our own place,
even if it means going into debt.

478
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:36,746
I'm sick and tired of
this bundle-carrying life.

479
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:39,415
Excuse me.

480
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:42,710
Hello. Would you like some mini snails?

481
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,254
Ae-sun? You're Oh Ae-sun, right?

482
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,298
It's Chang-suk. Go Chang-suk.

483
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,967
We went to high school together.

484
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:53,388
Oh, Chang-suk.

485
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:57,183
It's been ages.
I haven't seen you since you left school.

486
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:01,604
The others are wondering how you're doing.
You don't even attend school reunions.

487
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,690
Don't you get those?

488
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,191
The reunion postcards?

489
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:08,027
Maybe you're not on the list
because you dropped out?

490
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:11,906
I'll just give this to you for free.

491
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,158
I'll give you plenty.

492
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:17,745
Gosh, she can't even look.

493
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,499
Why? Is she embarrassed
about getting expelled?

494
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:24,544
No, not her high school friend.

495
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:37,306
<i>Mom could never bear</i>
<i>to look at kids that age.</i>

496
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,771
Hey, it's not here.

497
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:45,898
How old are you?

498
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:47,734
Fifteen.

499
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:50,820
Fifteen, born in the Year of the Tiger.

500
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:52,613
Yes.

501
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:56,784
Here it is.

502
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:57,994
Hey, where?

503
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,372
Is that popular these days?

504
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,709
- Sorry?
- What else is popular?

505
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,545
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

506
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,465
Sure, enjoy them all.

507
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:11,382
Yes, sir.

508
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:20,600
<i>In Dad's heart,</i>
<i>Dong-myeong was still growing up.</i>

509
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:26,522
I believe sympathy is part of evolution.

510
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:31,069
Look at the old women in the countryside.
They're fine after losing their kids.

511
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:33,488
They'd say,
"I had eight kids and two died."

512
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:37,158
"You had a brother once,"
as if it were nothing.

513
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,161
How can they?
How do you go on after losing a child?

514
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:42,205
But they carry on just fine.

515
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:45,249
What are they supposed to do?
Cry every day? Starve?

516
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,376
No, the point of our presentation

517
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,880
is to prove the correlation
between sympathy and civilization.

518
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:52,381
Right?

519
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,177
Are they below you?

520
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,098
What?

521
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:03,434
You think they are like that
because they're lesser than you?

522
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:08,106
Just keep playing with your eraser.

523
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:12,068
It's not because
they're not as admirable as you.

524
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:15,321
They don't act like nothing's wrong
because they're less evolved.

525
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,782
They move on because they have to.

526
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:23,037
Geum-myeong, I'm sorry to say this.

527
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:25,998
Do you feel inferior to me?

528
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:28,417
Why would I be?

529
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:33,089
Well, for several reasons.
You even lost your chance to study abroad.

530
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:36,008
Did I lose it? I'm just letting you go.

531
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,135
Letting me go?

532
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:42,974
Then you should go.

533
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,351
You can go.

534
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:57,738
You keep acting like you're letting me go,

535
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:01,117
but you don't get to go
just because your GPA is higher.

536
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,119
Family background
and circumstances count too.

537
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:04,537
Who said that?

538
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:06,372
Your father again?

539
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,709
Life's about the total score in the end.

540
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:19,051
<i>I'm the one who got 37 votes.</i>

541
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,761
So what if you got 37 votes?

542
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,555
Do your 37 votes matter now?

543
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:26,058
In real life,
37 votes don't mean anything!

544
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,977
Between you and Man-ki,

545
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:32,648
there's something that goes
beyond just nine votes, okay?

546
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:36,861
Take it.

547
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,113
Yeah, here. Take it.

548
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,200
Leave it here. Take one.

549
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:46,537
Man-ki's dad brought these
to celebrate him becoming president.

550
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,831
He treated you last time, right?

551
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:52,877
You should feel guilty
if you took a bun and didn't vote for him.

552
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:13,689
If you have to stay behind,
you'll get one only after you're done.

553
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:19,362
Yeah, take one.

554
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,031
Take one.

555
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:30,081
DIARY
OH AE-SUN

556
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:52,478
Man-ki! Are you even studying properly?

557
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:55,690
You're not just eating cream buns
at home, are you?

558
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,817
<i>Our class president is a fake president.</i>

559
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,277
<i>He's a cream bun president.</i>

560
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:03,281
<i>Even if he has 100 cream buns,</i>
<i>Lee Man-ki will never get 100 points.</i>

561
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,032
<i>But I got 100 points.</i>

562
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,630
<i>Mom was like a wildflower</i>
<i>that finds its way to the sunlight,</i>

563
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,675
<i>even if it was under a dark brick wall.</i>

564
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:23,884
Let's hurry.

565
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,971
<i>In the end,</i>
<i>she would always find the light.</i>

566
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:28,180
Careful.

567
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:33,102
This is where I was set up on a date
with Bu Sang-gil back in the day.

568
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:39,525
At the time,
I really thought my life was over.

569
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:46,991
I heard you really wanted
a man from Seoul.

570
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:51,329
I'm pretty much from Seoul.

571
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:53,706
Right after Korea's liberation,

572
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:56,375
my wealthy family sent me
to study in Seoul.

573
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:59,920
If I hadn't married and moved down here,

574
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,465
I could've been a man of power.

575
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:09,096
At the beginning of my first marriage…

576
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,433
Am I getting that tea anytime today?

577
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,150
Don't worry about what I think.

578
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,194
Love isn't…

579
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:24,278
Goodness.

580
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:28,157
Who would've thought I'd own this place?

581
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:32,536
As I said, in life, you never know
what will happen unless you go for it.

582
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,372
Go!

583
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:38,042
I even thought of the name of this place.

584
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,461
That's right.

585
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,255
The shop name should be chosen
by someone well-educated.

586
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:46,967
"Sun and the Three Aunties'."

587
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:49,845
Why bother with a complicated name?

588
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:52,890
Even poetry collections sell better
with a simple title.

589
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:55,810
This land has thousands of people
with "Sun" in their names,

590
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,020
so attracting them would be enough, right?

591
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:59,188
Yeah, that's right.

592
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:01,816
- Your name gets top billing.
- Let her do it.

593
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:07,113
Let's stop having lunch on the street.

594
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:10,825
From now on,
I'm only eating at the dining table.

595
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:12,827
You eat at the table.

596
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,870
So each of us gets a quarter, okay?

597
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:18,833
Ae-sun, you just pay this much.
We'll cover the rest.

598
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:20,626
The water pressure is low.

599
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:21,544
What?

600
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:23,462
The water pressure…

601
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:27,925
This is enough. You can wash
sea cucumbers and sea squirts with it.

602
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:29,468
I'll wash them all.

603
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:35,099
<i>However, while the faucet barely dripped,</i>
<i>steady and diligent,</i>

604
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,562
<i>the leaking hole was gushing relentlessly.</i>

605
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:43,107
ELIGIBILITY FOR STATE-FUNDED STUDY ABROAD

606
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:47,903
I just find it funny
that an English major is going to Japan.

607
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:52,366
It also means I'll graduate later,
so I probably shouldn't…

608
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,744
I don't think I should…

609
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:07,715
I… want you to go.

610
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:11,469
Ye-rim is a bit…

611
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:14,430
snobbish.

612
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:24,273
Since you don't qualify
for the state-funded scholarship,

613
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,318
as I mentioned before…

614
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:29,528
Oh no, please don't do that.

615
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:33,324
I'm going to leave.
I won't come back if you call me again.

616
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:36,285
Come on. I'm quite well off, you know?

617
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:38,996
You can pay me back later.

618
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:43,584
You said your car was the cheapest
in the faculty parking lot.

619
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:47,546
It's not the time to be worrying about me.
Be brazen at times like this!

620
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,256
Or you'll end up like me.

621
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:52,718
But you're really amazing.

622
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:56,847
I think you're the only professor
who gives apples to sparrows.

623
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:02,645
I'm truly grateful
that you are looking out for me.

624
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,774
I feel like I've already been to Japan.

625
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,693
Even your words are pretty.

626
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:15,658
<i>When I spoke to others,</i>
<i>it was as if I were writing a love letter.</i>

627
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:19,036
<i>I would choose my words carefully,</i>
<i>one by one.</i>

628
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:23,123
Yeah, she's such a great person.
A really great person.

629
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:27,711
<i>When others treat you well,</i>
<i>even just once, they become your savior.</i>

630
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:31,674
<i>Yeah, so you have to send</i>
<i>the best tangerines you can find.</i>

631
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:33,634
<i>She's so good to me.</i>

632
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:35,594
So what does she do for you?

633
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,680
Does she say she likes you
or you're doing well?

634
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:41,850
What did she say?
I want to hear it and feel happy too!

635
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:45,688
She wants to lend me money
so I can study abroad.

636
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,815
<i>It's not easy to do for others.</i>

637
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:51,360
<i>She takes only me to the faculty cafeteria</i>
<i>and buys me lunch.</i>

638
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,362
But you said

639
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,907
you didn't really want to study abroad.

640
00:42:56,991 --> 00:43:00,035
Just send a box of tangerines.

641
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:04,081
Do you want to study abroad?
You want to go?

642
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:06,500
<i>So what if I want to go?</i>

643
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,086
<i>Can I even go?</i>

644
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:10,212
How much is it?

645
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,214
<i>Come on, how much is it?</i>

646
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:14,550
You don't need to know.

647
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:18,053
<i>I'm not saying I'll pay for it.</i>
<i>Just tell me approximately how much.</i>

648
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:19,555
Mom, don't you watch TV?

649
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,432
The yen is crazy high now.

650
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:24,268
But you could at least tell me
the approximate cost.

651
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:26,145
You're really starting to make me mad.

652
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:28,230
<i>Are you a beggar? Don't you have parents?</i>

653
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:30,399
<i>Why would others offer to lend you money?</i>

654
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:31,900
<i>What on earth are you doing?</i>

655
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:34,153
You think I look like
I'm from a wealthy family?

656
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:37,448
<i>I'm not going to Japan,</i>
<i>so everyone knows we're not well-off.</i>

657
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:40,659
So how much is it?
Just tell me how much it is!

658
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:43,746
<i>And what if I tell you? You gonna send me</i>
<i>with money from the stall?</i>

659
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,706
If you have the money,
stop selling at the stall!

660
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:48,167
<i>Gosh, I want to stop too. I really do.</i>

661
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,209
<i>But how can I?</i>

662
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:57,801
Whatever, just forget it.
Don't bother sending the tangerines.

663
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,262
<i>Talking to you is just so annoying.</i>

664
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:04,975
<i>But I treated the savior</i>
<i>to whom I'm a million times grateful</i>

665
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,935
<i>like scrap paper.</i>

666
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,066
What now?

667
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:18,113
<i>I wasn't careful</i>
<i>with my words or my feelings.</i>

668
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:29,291
I'm not eligible whatsoever.

669
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:24,847
How much is it?

670
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:28,434
Just 300 won. Give me 300 won.

671
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:45,451
How much for all of it?

672
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:46,368
Huh?

673
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:48,495
I like beans.

674
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:53,000
<i>A kind-hearted mother</i>
<i>gave birth to a kind-hearted daughter.</i>

675
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,419
<i>They would always adore each other</i>

676
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,630
<i>and break each other's hearts.</i>

677
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:06,430
I want to stop selling on the street too.

678
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,683
Who in the world
wants to make a living as a street vendor?

679
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:14,313
I used to be coy as well.

680
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:16,732
I used to get called Literary Girl.

681
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:22,821
When I run into a high school friend
while eating on newspaper in the market,

682
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:25,574
I just want to stop eating.

683
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:27,993
I lose my appetite for the whole day.

684
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:38,921
Is she the only one with pride?
Am I like this because I lack it?

685
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:41,715
But what can I do?

686
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:44,092
She has so many things she wants to do,

687
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:46,887
and not being able to help
kills me inside.

688
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:57,523
Strange how you started asking for liquor
after seeing your beloved daughter.

689
00:46:59,024 --> 00:46:59,858
You know,

690
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:04,488
I have nothing to say to you or her.

691
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:11,495
My mom must've cried her eyes out

692
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:17,668
when I didn't become class president
due to mental and financial limitations.

693
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:21,547
I only get it now.

694
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:29,596
What did she say?

695
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:34,351
Did she cry about wanting to study abroad?
She cried out of frustration, right?

696
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:39,147
<i>For the daughter who would never grow up,</i>

697
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:42,609
<i>they ended up selling that house.</i>

698
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:49,449
These are the last persimmons, right?

699
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:53,203
Eat them all. Don't give any away.

700
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:56,373
Not even to our kids?

701
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:59,334
Not even to our kids.
Only you can eat them.

702
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:07,092
The more the kids grow,
the more they pick us clean, right?

703
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:09,386
Didn't you know
this was a losing business?

704
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,307
<i>They left behind the house</i>

705
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:17,102
<i>where Ae-sun's mother, little Ae-sun…</i>

706
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:21,440
<i>and the one whose name they dared not say,</i>

707
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:25,944
<i>Dong-myeong, would be missed.</i>

708
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:53,281
Mom, I didn't realize how young you were.

709
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:57,411
You need to get rid of the chipped ones!

710
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:02,541
You visited my dream when we moved here.
Are you back because we're leaving?

711
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:05,377
You're so stingy.

712
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:08,005
You should've visited my dreams more.

713
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,341
Mom, I'm upset.

714
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:14,928
I have so much I want to say to my mom.

715
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:19,641
What's the point of writing that?
He can't even read.

716
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:23,520
He didn't learn to read.
How can he read it?

717
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:28,150
Just in case he comes over here
during the holidays

718
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:30,193
and is surprised Mommy isn't here.

719
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:34,489
I didn't want to scare the baby.

720
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:44,833
Do you and Gwan-sik
still never talk about him?

721
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:50,714
Don't you talk to him about Dong-myeong?

722
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,012
Why would we?

723
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:00,974
We already know how each other feels.

724
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:05,812
Any other grief fades with time
and becomes numb.

725
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:08,065
But when the grief is too deep,

726
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:09,816
when it's too deep,

727
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:12,277
I end up burying it.

728
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:14,988
I just can't bring it up.

729
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:21,328
Ae-sun.

730
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:24,206
Talk to him.

731
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:26,291
Pour it all out.

732
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,418
Even the deep ocean

733
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:30,504
uses the waves

734
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:33,381
to pour out restlessly.

735
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:42,307
I'm sorry to say this to you.

736
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:48,105
I know it's not fair,
but I can bear to reminisce about you.

737
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:51,691
Not my baby though.

738
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:54,653
It's not possible with a child.

739
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:08,041
All I wanted was
for you to have a good life.

740
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:11,586
How will my baby go on?

741
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:14,965
How has my baby survived the pain?

742
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:22,597
I just forget briefly from time to time.

743
00:52:24,015 --> 00:52:25,308
Just from time to time.

744
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:31,523
Somehow, life goes on.

745
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:00,594
THE MOON WANES,

746
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:03,597
YET THE YOUNG HEART REMAINS.

747
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,806
<i>Tomorrow…</i>

748
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:06,474
Hurry, this way.

749
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:12,272
<i>…life will go on</i>
<i>under the blazing sun of tomorrow.</i>

750
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:13,190
Careful.

751
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:20,614
Damn those planes.
Why are there so many of them?

752
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,459
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

753
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:35,295
<i>we are now arriving</i>
<i>at New Tokyo International Airport.</i>

754
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:38,089
- Hey, can you empty this ashtray?
- Yes, sir.

755
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:40,800
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

756
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:44,846
<i>we are now arriving</i>
<i>at New Tokyo International Airport.</i>

757
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:49,142
<i>The local time is 11:50 a.m.</i>

758
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,899
Why did she wrap it over and over?

759
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,569
Why did she wrap it like this?

760
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:01,404
Seriously.

761
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:36,606
Have some, crybaby.

762
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:43,196
Thank you.

763
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,155
No problem.

764
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,301
<i>I swallowed their dreams</i>
<i>and spread my wings,</i>

765
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:08,847
<i>embracing my mom's dream</i>
<i>like a seed in my heart.</i>

766
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:27,574
Is this funny? Is this funny to you?

767
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:30,910
That damn studying…

768
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:37,834
How I really wanted to do it so badly.

769
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:44,507
But now my daughter
is even going to study abroad.

770
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:47,552
It's so thrilling, isn't it?

771
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:48,845
How fantastic is that?

772
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:50,263
So are you happy?

773
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:58,480
<i>Mom!</i>

774
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:01,691
Mom!

775
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:05,403
<i>Mom's dream was passed on to me</i>…

776
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:14,537
<i>Mom's dream was passed on to me</i>…

777
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:24,756
<i>a dream so heavy, a dream so blazing…</i>

778
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:29,010
<i>When you guys soar,</i>

779
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:33,014
I swear it feels like I'm soaring too.

780
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:36,851
<i>…that, at last,</i>
<i>it made the sound of wings flapping.</i>

781
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:41,856
WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU TANGERINES

782
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:46,194
{\an8}DODONG GIRLS' HIGH

783
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:54,077
Did you get Ae-sun's permission?

784
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:57,414
Why limit writing contests to kids?

785
00:56:57,497 --> 00:57:01,709
Sauces taste better when fermented.
One knows life better after living it.

786
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:04,421
Kids don't know life's thorns and burdens.

787
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:06,714
<i>Once again,</i>

788
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:10,051
<i>if there is a student named Oh Ae-sun,</i>

789
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:13,263
<i>please come to the faculty office</i>
<i>immediately.</i>

790
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:14,264
<i>Oh Ae-sun.</i>

791
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:16,141
When the students are taking tests,

792
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:20,979
there are always some students
who never write their grade and class,

793
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:23,273
no matter how many times you remind them.

794
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:27,735
Did I or did I not tell you
that you must tell them countless times?

795
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:30,822
Did I or did I not?

796
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:34,159
Am I talking to a wall?

797
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:37,704
The winner is from our school,
and we can't find the student.

798
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:40,248
What am I supposed to tell the principal?

799
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,376
Goodness gracious.

800
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:46,713
EVEN AS I GENTLY PRESS MY HEART
TO SOOTHE IT DOWN

801
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:49,382
THE MOON WANES,
YET THE YOUNG HEART REMAINS.

802
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:39,802
"IN THE HOPE THAT OUR ECHOES
WILL FLOW AND FLOW UNTIL THEY REACH YOU."
