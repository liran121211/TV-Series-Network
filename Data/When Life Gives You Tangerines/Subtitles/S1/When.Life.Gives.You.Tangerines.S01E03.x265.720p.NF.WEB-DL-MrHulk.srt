1
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,982
WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU TANGERINES

2
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,903
Is he a spy? He's not, is he?

3
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,989
I heard he was born and raised in Busan.

4
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:13,990
Hey, Kim.

5
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,701
The kid doesn't decide what he is.

6
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,828
That's for Namsan CIA to decide.

7
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,542
You finished the food. Were you hungry?

8
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,254
Keep your head down.

9
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,507
Head down. Is this a theater?

10
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,343
These kids run away
because the government feeds them.

11
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,679
These punks with their heads full of crap
need to be sent to Namsan.

12
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,973
Putting them behind bars
would be patriotic.

13
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:45,980
How sweet. They're in love.

14
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,820
Have you lost your mind, kid?

15
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,115
You're in the big city now, Jeju boy.

16
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,491
Why roll up your sleeves?

17
00:01:56,574 --> 00:02:00,370
How dare you act tough
in front of a big-city senior officer!

18
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,205
- You punk!
- Are you a lord?

19
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:10,672
If you hit us, must we take it?
If you send us to Namsan, must we go?

20
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:13,508
How sweet. Double trouble.

21
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:17,053
Can you believe this?
These little punks are shameless!

22
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:17,971
So what if I am?

23
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:21,057
Is it illegal? Will I get locked up?
Am I going to Namsan?

24
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:22,809
You smoke, don't you?

25
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:25,937
You smoke, and you wear miniskirts?

26
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,564
Am I going to Namsan for that?

27
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,567
That lady reported us as runaways, right?

28
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,153
She couldn't say anything else
because she felt guilty.

29
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:36,364
What else? Did you steal something?
You caused more trouble, right?

30
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:39,659
We're not being held here
because we hit anyone or stole anything.

31
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:44,497
We're minors who need the protection
of the Busan Police.

32
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,415
That's why

33
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:49,419
we're also quietly waiting
for our guardians, so--

34
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:52,046
- Shall we serve you?
- Don't hit him in the head!

35
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,512
Send this girl to the National Assembly.

36
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,139
Oh man.

37
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:04,100
I didn't know Romeo and Juliet
were from Jeju.

38
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,477
Aren't you calling your mothers?

39
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,604
They don't need to.

40
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,190
The woman camping out front
is the boy's mother.

41
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:12,192
What?

42
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,235
This one is handsome.

43
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,821
This one is vixen-like.

44
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:18,907
Here she comes.

45
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:21,826
Mom.

46
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:26,456
Mom.

47
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,589
- Where's the bag? Where's my stuff?
- What?

48
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:36,257
Where's my jewelry?

49
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,721
My gold… Good grief!

50
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,390
Where's my gold frog?

51
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:45,975
Where's my gold frog?

52
00:03:58,988 --> 00:03:59,822
Is it real?

53
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,574
It is real gold, isn't it?

54
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:04,285
It is.

55
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,748
He always does too much.

56
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:11,209
He's like this
for every wedding anniversary.

57
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,962
He just can't wait to buy me gifts
on special days.

58
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:15,463
Is that so?

59
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:21,052
Our cabinet is chock-full of jewelry.

60
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,972
I'm clearing out anything out of style.

61
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,682
Give me a good price.

62
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,016
Is that so?

63
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:30,311
You gave me a good price
for the jewelry last time.

64
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,356
You came last summer
and said it was your anniversary.

65
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:36,609
Isn't your anniversary in the summer?

66
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:40,196
Your husband got you a gold bracelet
back then, right?

67
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:45,660
No, it's in the spring.

68
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,371
Is that so?

69
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,040
What if it is?

70
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,293
Is that a problem?

71
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,045
Hello.

72
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,798
- How much is it?
- 300 won.

73
00:04:58,881 --> 00:04:59,966
- Give it to me.
- Okay.

74
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,718
- No, give it to me.
- To me.

75
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,220
Give it to me.

76
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,389
Just give it to me.

77
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,225
No, don't give it to her.
Just give it to me.

78
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,686
Hey, I'm the owner. Why would he pay you?

79
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:14,397
- Is this your inn?
- It's my money anyway.

80
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,484
This woman stole my bag,
so I'm taking whatever I can from her.

81
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,402
No. Give it to me.

82
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,820
I'll come back later.

83
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,655
Wait, hold on!

84
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,449
Where are you going? Wait…

85
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,747
Just go away.

86
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:32,832
Gonna stay all night?

87
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,086
Hey, you know
why there are no thieves in Jeju?

88
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,047
Why? Are Jeju folks epically generous?

89
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,550
We wear them down.
We keep going until they're sick of it.

90
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:45,094
It's the thief, not the victim,
who ends up cracking

91
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,388
because we wear them down.

92
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:52,101
Wow, you lunatic.

93
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,603
For Christ's sake.

94
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,355
You're a lunatic!

95
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,482
An absolute lunatic!

96
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:00,360
Completely out of your damn mind!

97
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:04,364
I'm taking what I'm owed, no matter what.

98
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:08,451
I'll be here day and night
until I get what my gold toad is worth.

99
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,953
What? Did you say gold toad?

100
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,664
Give me my gold toad.

101
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:14,749
Hey.

102
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,460
So the gold frog is a gold toad now?

103
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:18,628
You're the thief--

104
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,215
Do you have a frog's brain?

105
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,884
What can you do?
You should give her the gold frog back.

106
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:29,305
It's too late now.
Give me a gold toad now.

107
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:33,017
You're one brazen robber, aren't you?

108
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,936
I bet you've got a criminal record.

109
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,270
You do, don't you?

110
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,897
Should we call the cops?

111
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,775
- Should we call the cops?
- Ma'am!

112
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,111
- Ma'am!
- What the hell?

113
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:49,325
Why did you go to the jewelry store? Why?

114
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:55,748
This will be your tenth offense.

115
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,292
Think of your child, will you?

116
00:06:58,793 --> 00:06:59,794
Let's go.

117
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:02,296
Don't let anyone from Jeju stay
while I'm away.

118
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,674
Take her away.

119
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:05,800
Get off me!

120
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,844
This is her tenth offense?

121
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,389
Wow, she's got some nerve.

122
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,487
Hey, you better pay for the fan!

123
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,114
Pay for the fan!

124
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,324
Were you performing circus acts in there?

125
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,076
How did you even manage to break it?

126
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,786
Well done! Great job!

127
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,663
Hey, stop pushing me!

128
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,299
My goodness.

129
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,766
Did you buy the tofu already?

130
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:57,602
No.

131
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,687
I didn't buy it.

132
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,105
The lady bought it for us.

133
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,906
What about your first birthday rings?
You didn't bring them with you?

134
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:11,699
Didn't you take them too?

135
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,701
Everything we took was in the bag.

136
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,623
Your dad… That worthless mutt.

137
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,708
Dogs are better

138
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,377
than both you and your father.

139
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,550
Ae-sun, let's go home.

140
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,473
{\an8}You've really done it this time, Ae-sun.

141
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:38,267
{\an8}YESTERDAY WAS YOUR SPRING

142
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,520
{\an8}You've really done it, Ae-sun.

146
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:00,957
<i>I heard he's one</i>

147
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,793
<i>Well, she's the poet of class eight.</i>

00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,294
<i>Poet, my foot.</i>

EXPULSION NOTICE
OH AE-SUN

152
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:40,371
DUE TO AN UNAUTHORIZED RUNAWAY
AND DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIOR

153
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,709
You've completely ruined your life!

154
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:48,379
People exaggerate everything
on this island.

155
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:51,090
I can't even show my face
at the wholesale market.

156
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:54,010
You've brought shame to our family!

157
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,303
And Jong-gu made us proud?

158
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,472
How can you compare him to her?

159
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:02,935
A man can lose his land or his home
while running a business.

160
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,979
Why do you keep bringing him up?

161
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,440
Did he run a business? He played cards.

162
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:09,942
So now what?

163
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,653
What will you do now?
You won't go to the factory.

164
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,740
You can't get married.
Will you die a spinster in this house?

165
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:24,498
What about him? What did that brat say?

166
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:32,298
Don't you see your grandmother,
who raised you since you were a baby?

167
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,884
Do you only care about yourself?

168
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,552
How can I face our ancestors?

169
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:40,056
I'm the one marrying her,
not our ancestors.

170
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,561
What will we say to our ancestors?

171
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,981
That our filial son brought home
an orphan wife, a middle school graduate?

172
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:53,361
Who brings a middle school graduate
into a noble family as a daughter-in-law?

173
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,529
Why is she a middle school graduate?

174
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,530
What did you expect?

175
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:59,909
That the school would just give her
a diploma after she eloped at night?

176
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,079
Just go beg there!

177
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:06,165
Go beg there
so you can become their daughter-in-law.

178
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:08,459
The whole island knows about their affair.

179
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:10,628
She's lost any chance
of having a proper marriage.

180
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,213
She can't marry Gwan-sik either.

181
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,256
His grandmother almost fainted.

182
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:19,428
Wow, Oh Ae-sun.
Heck of a relationship you've got there.

183
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,765
Gambling away your whole life
by eloping at night.

184
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,435
I've only been suspended.

185
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,437
Wow, congratulations.

186
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,855
But why was she the only one

187
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:32,900
who got expelled?

188
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:35,611
Middle school graduates can't even solder.

189
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:36,654
Damn it.

190
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:37,905
Why was only Ae-sun…

191
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,532
Do you really not know?

192
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,075
It might take two to tango,

193
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,952
but the boy gets called a hero

194
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,705
while the girl's love
gets branded shameless.

195
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,749
Did you ruin her life
without knowing better?

196
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,876
It was my idea.

197
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,087
That fool just followed along.

198
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:54,922
We should be so proud!

199
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,926
Remove him from the family registry!

200
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,512
No one's punishing my kid!

201
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,264
Ae-sun should be punished.

202
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,350
You don't burn the whole house down
over one maggot.

203
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:09,895
Why punish someone else's kid?
Our son is the one who's crazy about her.

204
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:14,650
Seriously, I'm going to take that girl,
scold her, and pinch her, then…

205
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,818
Come on!

206
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,403
Did that work last time?

207
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:20,114
What good did pulling my hair do?

208
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:22,658
You want me to lose my grandson
under my nose too?!

209
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:27,288
You don't catch a chicken
by chasing it with a stick.

210
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,998
You lure it with a worm.

211
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:30,916
You have to wheedle them.

212
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,919
If you chase them, they'll run miles away.

213
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:39,133
How could they use a spoon
to lock you away? Seriously.

214
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:41,844
Oh dear.

215
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,222
Goodness me.

216
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,350
Have you had something to eat?

217
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:49,769
Yes.

218
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,564
I never skip meals.

219
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,151
I see.

220
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:58,819
Well, that's good to hear.

221
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,739
Gwan-sik hasn't been able to eat a thing.

222
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,033
Is he on a hunger strike?

223
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,826
You know he'd never do that.

224
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:09,038
His father told me not to feed him
a single grain of rice.

225
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,378
Ae-sun, even though I want to help,

226
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:20,716
you know I can't go against
his grandmother, don't you?

227
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:26,514
I married into this tiresome Yang family,
and I'm still paying the price for it.

228
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,266
You know how stubborn the Yangs are.

229
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:33,479
Remember how Gwan-sik stole fish from us
to give to you every day for ten years?

230
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,900
I gave your family cabbages
from time to time too.

231
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,863
Where do you think he gets it from?

232
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,990
He gets it from his father.

233
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:49,662
His father is even willing
to sever ties with him for good.

234
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,622
Goodness.

235
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,792
That's how narrow-minded he is.

236
00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:00,130
I was once so crazy about him,
I even eloped with him at night.

237
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,675
But you can't expect
to live on love forever.

238
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:07,680
Right up until the wedding,
they'll tell you that you're the only one.

239
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:12,893
But once married, they forget you.
They're just devoted to their mothers.

240
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,647
You wait and see, okay?

241
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:20,359
You'll end up alone
in our family for sure.

242
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,574
- Well…
- Yeah, what is it?

243
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:32,454
Can I ask you something?

244
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,977
We're in a tight spot financially,
and it's been pretty unsettling for us.

245
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,147
We can't even offer your family
a silver spoon.

246
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,024
Still, I'd never let her starve.

247
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,903
What about your family?
Do they approve of her?

248
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,946
Can you beat a shaman?

249
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,407
Your shaman grandma said

250
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,368
that Ae-sun was bound
to her widow mother's spirit.

251
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:15,164
Everyone here worships the Dragon King
rather than God or Buddha.

252
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,833
No one can stand up to a shaman.

253
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,754
Ae-sun will be living with me,
not my grandmother.

254
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,839
I'll keep Ae-sun safe from her.

255
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,342
So what? Are you planning on moving out?

256
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,801
You have a home in your name?

257
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,473
Who do you think you are,
taking care of me?

258
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:34,725
Do you think I'm spoiled fish
you can get cheap?

259
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,895
You had her sleep in a room
with fermented soybean bricks?

260
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:41,440
I won't do it.
It makes me feel small and cheap. No way.

261
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:42,691
But I want to.

262
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,444
Why? You think
I can't get married unless it's to you?

263
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:49,156
I'm going to marry a richer,
more handsome man,

264
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,699
a son less precious than you!

265
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,576
Go on, then. Get married.

266
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,661
Take anyone you can!

267
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,996
I won't do it. I'll never marry you.

268
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,248
See if I ever marry you. Just watch me!

269
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,470
Hey! Bring some tea here.

270
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:15,099
- Miss Ko, serve him some tea.
- Yes, ma'am.

271
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,101
Hello, sir.

272
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:20,312
So you raised two siblings
all on your own?

273
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:25,859
That experience
is the main reason I approved of you.

274
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:27,403
I see.

275
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,088
I heard you really wanted
a man from Seoul.

276
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:52,219
I'm… pretty much from Seoul.

277
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,264
Right after Korea's liberation,

278
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,725
my wealthy family sent me
to study in Seoul.

279
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,020
If I hadn't married and moved down here,

280
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,272
I could've been a man of power.

281
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,112
At the beginning of my first marriage…

282
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,741
Am I getting that tea anytime today?

283
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,377
Don't worry about what I think.

284
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,338
Love isn't a crime, after all.

285
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:35,012
I heard a few things
about your past through the grapevine.

286
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,013
But today,

287
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,475
I just took the plunge and came out.

288
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:45,105
I've crossed the Pacific many times,
so handling a small flaw is no big deal.

289
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:48,776
I'm more of a Seoul type.
I don't care about things like that.

290
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,571
They say remarriages
work out better for both.

291
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,698
It takes one to know one, you know.

292
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:58,494
It'd be very demanding to marry someone
who'd never been married.

293
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,788
That would give me a headache.

294
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:10,297
Are you going to drink that thing?
It cost 50 won.

295
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,262
<i>Sure, he's been married before,</i>

296
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,098
but he owns boats.

297
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,517
Not just one.

298
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,853
To go on a boat in Dodong-ri,
you have to use one of his family's.

299
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,482
If you really want,

300
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:32,194
I heard he'll try to send you to college
within ten years.

301
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,905
If you do well,

302
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:38,867
he might even think about
publishing your poetry book.

303
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,538
It's only two children, so…

304
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,375
At least it's not three.

305
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:53,048
I guess I was born to be a maid.

306
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:55,551
My goodness.

307
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,888
The spring rain is lasting a long time.

308
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,561
Maybe it's my mom crying.

309
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,317
Maybe she's crying
because I'm getting married like this.

310
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:28,792
Gwang-rye will be turning in her grave!

311
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:34,381
You've totally ruined a young girl's life,
and you still have an appetite?

312
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:37,384
If you're so sad about her,
give her your son.

313
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:38,510
How does that sound?

314
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,971
No way is she marrying
a man who's been married!

315
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:44,725
Both families are so determined
to get rid of Ae-sun.

316
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:46,476
Mak-cheon.

317
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,312
You may perform rituals,

318
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,814
but you have no right
to scold other families.

319
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,275
If she marries that man,

320
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,903
I won't believe in your Dragon King
or the spirits.

321
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,238
Being good should pay off.

322
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,781
Being good should pay!

323
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,617
Stop talking already!

324
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,452
Is Ae-sun getting married?

325
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,666
MADAM BAEK GI-NAM'S 60TH BIRTHDAY

326
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:18,217
Are you regifting that gift set
to my family?

327
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,135
This is American.

328
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,348
Only it's made in Korea.

329
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:27,935
It's all the same once you eat it.

330
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,520
I despise all these pointless formalities.

331
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:35,943
The whole wedding business
is just another meaningless formality.

332
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,111
It's just a way of robbing people.

333
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:46,453
Honestly, white dresses
are for first weddings.

334
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:49,414
Let's just wear formal clothes
and take some photos.

335
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,417
Technically, it's not the first
for either of us anyway.

336
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,171
Speaking of which,

337
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:59,591
I was personally curious about something.

338
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,343
Well…

339
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,180
About Busan.

340
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:12,271
Does your mother know about this?

341
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:17,651
Good heavens.
You must've cleared out your entire store.

342
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:20,153
- Goodness.
- This is as good as theft.

343
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,031
I won't let Ae-sun starve either.

344
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,742
I can give her a whole mackerel every day.

345
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,703
We are no longer living in a time of war.

346
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,121
People don't marry for food.

347
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,875
Are you really her grandmother?
Are you really her uncle?

348
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:37,296
I knew something was up
when you wouldn't give her any croakers!

349
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,131
Why are you bringing up croakers?

350
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:42,467
I heard he has already been married.
That he's 30!

351
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,512
Why would you match Ae-sun
with a man like him?

352
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:48,765
Even the actor Shin Seong-il
wouldn't be good enough for her!

353
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:51,059
Why would a movie star want Ae-sun?

354
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,187
Why would you throw away
a girl as pretty as Ae-sun?

355
00:21:57,607 --> 00:22:00,444
She's smart, well-spoken,

356
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:02,029
and really cute.

357
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:05,657
Why would you? Why?

358
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:07,951
Keep on yapping.

359
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:15,083
Let me take her.

360
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,336
I've been giving her croakers for years

361
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,921
and selling her cabbages all this time.

362
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,507
I care about Ae-sun more than anyone else!

363
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,927
More than you!
So why are you taking her from me?

364
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,846
What do you want me to do?

365
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:29,431
Should I put her on a leash?

366
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:33,310
Should I put her on a leash
and drag her to marry you?

367
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:35,479
She doesn't want to.
Who will change her mind?

368
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:39,816
When a tame cow decides to rebel,
it won't budge.

369
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,444
You can't force it to plow the field.

370
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:44,988
What's wrong with her?

371
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,656
Go ask your mother.

372
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,743
Ask her how she convinced Ae-sun.

373
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,997
You know, in Busan,

374
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:58,502
were you caught the day you ran away
or some time later?

375
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:03,673
I guess kids today will do what they want,
even if they don't stay the night.

376
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,592
How about you, Captain?

377
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:12,015
Did you separate from your wife
early in the marriage or some time later?

378
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:14,518
Goddamn it!

379
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:18,230
You've got a temper.

380
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,690
Yes, I do.

381
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,902
That's why I dislike rude people.

382
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:26,822
Does that boy know this side of you?
And he still likes you?

383
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,824
- It's why he likes me!
- Goddamn it!

384
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:30,617
You little punk!

385
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,453
Don't get in the way of this marriage!

386
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:34,371
Darn it.

387
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:35,747
It's a party now.

388
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,544
Hey, kid. You little punk!

389
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:42,921
What? What now?

390
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:43,839
Let's go.

391
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:47,050
Come on. Let's go!

392
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:50,429
Where? Go where?

393
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,222
Got anywhere to go?

394
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,517
Goddamn it! Hey, you!

395
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:59,146
How dare you be disrespectful
when a grown-up--

396
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,480
Shut it, mister!

397
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:09,739
Don't go. Marry me.

398
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,741
You have the ring on, so that's it.

399
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,536
What's it for? Can we live off it forever?

400
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,872
Are we running away again?
To become thieves?

401
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,373
Are you really marrying him?

402
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,003
Why would you? Why?

403
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:25,797
Yeah, he's remarrying and has two kids.

404
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:29,301
But why would you? Why?

405
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,386
Exactly! Why me? Why only me?

406
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:33,430
Why do I get all the blame?

407
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:36,516
Why was I the only one expelled?
Why am I the "shameless" one?

408
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:38,810
It's over. All of it.

409
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,645
College? Being a poet?

410
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:44,107
It's all gone to crap.

411
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,902
I can't even become a solderer now.

412
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,320
I said I'd take care of you.

413
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:50,405
- I've told you a million--
- But how?

414
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,492
What have you done for me since I was ten?

415
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,911
Give me mackerels? Croakers?

416
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:56,870
I'm not a beggar!

417
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:58,955
You were ten, but so was I.

418
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:02,751
- What can a ten-year-old do?
- He said he'd do everything for me.

419
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,295
He'll send me to college
and let me be a poet.

420
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:06,213
I can do that too!

421
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:09,049
I'll work on boats.
I'll lay bricks. Anything!

422
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:10,967
No! I don't want you!

423
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:23,688
Being with you would be like
always getting a losing roll.

424
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:29,611
- What?
- I'm tired of having to be so willful.

425
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:33,281
I'm sick of living with a family
that doesn't want me.

426
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:38,620
I want to be rich too.
I want to live a comfortable life.

427
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:41,790
If I marry you,
I'll just get even more mistreated.

428
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,626
But if I marry him,
no one will speak badly of me.

429
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:45,669
Not even you.

430
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:49,422
Because you know everything.
You've seen it all. I've…

431
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,680
I've…

432
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,725
lived in shame my whole life.

433
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:02,936
One of them is free.

434
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:04,479
Did your mom say so?

435
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,231
Did she say that?

436
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:09,818
There are six people in the family,
but you only ever buy five.

437
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,611
Do you make a fortune selling fish?

438
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,280
Nosy little brat.

439
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,449
That little punk.

440
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,412
<i>You've seen it all.</i>

441
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,123
I…

442
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,668
I miss her so much.

443
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:29,713
He told me to go to Busan.

444
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:32,465
He told me to work at a factory!

445
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,968
I don't have a home anymore.

446
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:37,762
<i>You know everything,</i>

447
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:40,265
<i>and you want me to keep living like this?</i>

448
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,519
If I'm with you…

449
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:49,024
I won't find happiness in marriage.

450
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,527
Please let me live my life.

451
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:58,950
Let me change the fate you pity so.

452
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,331
Am I

453
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,458
standing in your way?

454
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,674
Gwan-sik.

455
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:19,304
You have to leave so I can live my life.

456
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,349
You have to leave…

457
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,685
so I can live my life.

458
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:48,875
<i>For ages, she gazed</i>
<i>at her 18-year-old first love,</i>

459
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,836
<i>whom she would never see again</i>…

460
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:57,759
<i>and buried her pure love</i>
<i>in that yellow spring.</i>

461
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:00,345
<i>Tearfully so.</i>

462
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:02,389
My ring.

463
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,563
My ring.

464
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:25,161
They say working in a field is rewarding,
but parenting never is.

465
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,581
Of course you treat me differently.

466
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,667
You'd never treat me like your own child.

467
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:36,005
{\an8}Every time she split a fried egg,
my portion was always smaller than yours.

468
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,757
There you go again.

469
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,343
Mom, why did you marry
into a family like this?

470
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:43,263
I chose my own path.
I only have myself to blame.

471
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,391
I wouldn't choose to live like you.

472
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,184
No way. Never.

473
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:52,439
I will marry a man from Seoul,
no matter what.

474
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:56,401
Not a guy who doesn't even know
what "nostalgia" is.

475
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:57,318
Never!

476
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:02,115
That's right. You should "never."

477
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:07,203
So do you regret it? Even a little?

478
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,832
Of course not.

479
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,918
If I hadn't met your father,
none of you would be here.

480
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,754
No, not as a mom.

481
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:16,921
As Oh Ae-sun.

482
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:21,634
Just eat your chicken.

483
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,386
What? Tell us.

484
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:28,683
Do you, Oh Ae-sun, regret it?
Do you think about what could've been?

485
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:30,935
Oh Ae-sun?

486
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:33,897
Oh Ae-sun…

487
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,861
was truly broken that spring.

488
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:18,191
Come on, kids.
They'll die if you touch them. Okay?

489
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:19,943
Bring us some good ones!

490
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:21,861
Don't dump leftovers on this island.

491
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:24,239
If you touch them and they die,
I can't sell them.

492
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:28,159
Gwang-rye, stop crying.

493
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:32,455
You should hurry
and send your precious son to safety.

494
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:36,167
I hope he finds a wife of noble birth
to bring home.

495
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:43,174
So you actually fed the chicken a worm.

496
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:46,261
Wow, you're so good. Really.

497
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,721
Scarily good.

498
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,268
<i>Well,</i>

499
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:57,188
can I ask you something?

500
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:04,112
Come on, just think of me as your mother.

501
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:08,366
Well, was Gwan-sik

502
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:13,037
really one of the top four in Jeju?

503
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:17,083
Was he close to winning medals?

504
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:22,589
He probably would've won one by now
if he hadn't been sidetracked.

505
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:25,466
He wasn't just any fourth.
He was practically third.

506
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,094
Almost tied for third.

507
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,848
That foolish idiot.

508
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,226
Do you guys curse
when you talk to each other?

509
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:38,104
He said he just went
for the free milk and bread.

510
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:40,773
He never told me he was good.

511
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:45,945
How can he follow me around for ten years
and never tell me what he likes?

512
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:49,866
He always let me go on and on
about becoming a poet, but he…

513
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,118
But he…

514
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:54,412
That's what guys
in the Yang family are like.

515
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:58,416
They think they're not supposed
to express their opinions.

516
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:08,009
Ae-sun.

517
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:10,803
Gwan-sik…

518
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,767
will lose it all if he's with you.

519
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:19,395
He will lose his dreams and his family.

520
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:24,484
You know what being alone is like,
don't you?

521
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:29,405
Don't take everything away from Gwan-sik.

522
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:32,909
You have to let him live his life
to the fullest.

523
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:36,412
Ae-sun.

524
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:41,960
Let him live his life.

525
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:43,836
Please.

526
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:46,547
Am I…

527
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,344
standing in his way?

528
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:53,388
<i>Am I</i>

529
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,599
standing in your way?

530
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:31,259
Gwan-sik!

531
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:33,469
Here!

532
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,139
You're going to make it.

533
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:38,141
I've coached for ten years,

534
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:39,809
but you're the only one

535
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:42,937
who actually ran 100 laps
just because you were told to.

536
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:46,858
Your mom sells fish
to support your studies on the mainland.

537
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:50,069
So let's train hard and win a gold medal.

538
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,571
Once you win a gold medal,

539
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:55,033
you'll forget what she even looks like.

540
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:57,785
- You know those gold medals?
- Yeah?

541
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,412
They aren't pure gold.

542
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,165
What?

543
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:07,211
Why work so hard for something
that's not real gold?

544
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:08,963
I don't need one anymore.

545
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,506
Is your life over or what?

546
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,801
You were the one harping on
about the gold medal and the mainland.

547
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,094
Well, that's because

548
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,681
Ae-sun wished to leave the island.

549
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:22,268
Does Ae-sun take up most of your life?

550
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:23,436
My whole damn life.

551
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:25,521
Get off.

552
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:28,900
I only ran 100 laps because of Ae-sun.

553
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:33,112
Selling fish doesn't pay enough,
and my grades aren't great.

554
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,406
I ran 100 laps in the hope
it'd give me a chance.

555
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,866
What lunatic would run that?

556
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:39,786
Get off, you punk.

557
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:43,414
The truth is, I actually hate athletics.

558
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:44,332
What?

559
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,501
It's not for me.
I can't place better than fourth.

560
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,169
Even if they gave me a box of gold…

561
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,215
I would only do it for Ae-sun.

562
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:57,011
You crazy bastard.
Then why are you going to Seoul right now?

563
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,973
<i>You have to leave so I can live my life.</i>

564
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:05,770
You have to leave so I can live my life.

565
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:25,248
I'm a pretty modern guy.

566
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,669
I'm open-minded, so I can overlook it.

567
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,631
No other family
would have shown you mercy.

568
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:40,346
How dare that nobody
speak to me like that!

569
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:41,722
Goddamn it.

570
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:45,685
His family runs a fish store
that's about the size of a booger?

571
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:49,147
He doesn't even own anything,
the impudent little punk.

572
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,565
It's bigger than a booger.

573
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:55,027
- What?
- It's definitely bigger than your boogers.

574
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,488
Goddamn it. You think
you can disrespect a grown-up

575
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,615
just because I've been nice to you?

576
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,909
Why is a grown-up marrying a child, then?

577
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,120
Goddamn it. Hey, you little brat!

578
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,663
Don't speak to me rudely.

579
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,374
Listen, wake up.

580
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:10,543
I don't think you grasp the situation.

581
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:13,796
I might be paying your tuition.
Don't tell me how to speak.

582
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,883
Am I marrying a perfect girl
from a wealthy family?

583
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,384
I don't want your money.

584
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:20,595
I don't want it.

585
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:23,806
Really?

586
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:27,059
Wait, are you serious, miss?

587
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,438
What about college?

588
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:35,109
What about becoming a poet?
What about the mainland?

589
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,739
I should only rely on my family.

590
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:49,123
Aren't you marrying me to go to college?

591
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:51,334
Why else would you?

592
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:55,630
Why else would you marry me?

593
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,507
I don't have…

594
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:01,510
anywhere to go.

595
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:04,555
What?

596
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,768
There's nothing else I can do.

597
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,562
<i>I'm going to do it all.</i>

598
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,398
I'm going to do all of it.

599
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,859
I'll be the chief of the fishing co-op.

600
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:19,570
I'm also going to be
the president five times.

601
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,489
All right, go on. Do it!

602
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:24,408
Let's make a king
out of one of our <i>haenyeo crew.</i>

603
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:28,079
I wonder why she wasn't born as a boy.

604
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:33,334
How is it that such a little girl
has been gifted with so much potential?

605
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:37,338
If she has such great potential,
she should run for president.

606
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:41,008
Go ahead.
You already have eight votes from us.

607
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:43,552
Nine votes.

608
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,098
That's right! Nine.

609
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,934
What score did you get in math?

610
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:52,728
What do you want to become?

611
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,234
Don't even ask him!

612
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:00,569
The First Lady.

613
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:04,949
The First Lady.

614
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:10,538
- My goodness, kid.
- Look who's got a crush!

615
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:30,850
I'm getting married
because I have nowhere else to go.

616
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,686
Even if I died, I'd have nowhere to go.

617
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:36,981
They say living on a pile of dog crap
is better than dying, so…

618
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,649
I'm a pile of dog crap?

619
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,986
Can you just hire me?

620
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:44,905
I'll be a maid or a babysitter
and make it worth your while.

621
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,035
Hey, listen.

622
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:52,621
All the housework will be free
if I get a wife, so why would I?

623
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,248
Why would I do that?

624
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:58,502
As the queen of love,
you may have dreamed of a passionate love,

625
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,421
but I'm just looking for a spouse.

626
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:04,342
I want a docile daughter-in-law for my mom
and a frugal mother for my children.

627
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:05,760
For God's sake!

628
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:14,143
I only met my ex-wife five times
before we got married.

629
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:15,603
People live like that.

630
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:18,481
You just have to make a fuss over it,
don't you?

631
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:22,985
Hey, wait!
Just use the cheapest fabrics here.

632
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:36,415
Anyway, tell me this.

633
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,418
You spent the night with him?

634
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:55,643
That crazy little brat!

635
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:59,313
<i>If she hadn't run that day…</i>

636
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:01,816
<i>If she hadn't run…</i>

637
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:06,195
Gyeong-ok, let's go home.

638
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,869
This damn rain. It's bucketing down!

639
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:17,581
Let's just say it was a rough patch.

640
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,085
Out of sight, out of mind.

641
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:22,837
Out of mind?

642
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:27,508
Then why do the Cowherd and Weaver Girl's
tears still rain down on us today?

643
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:28,801
Gwan-sik!

644
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:31,470
Gwan-sik!

645
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:34,598
Gwan-sik!

646
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,727
Where are you going?

647
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:41,981
Where are you going?

648
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,402
How can you just leave me here?

649
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,112
That's right.

650
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,029
Gwan-sik!

651
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,073
How can a young heart resist love?

652
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:52,867
Yang Gwan-sik!

653
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,785
Yang Gwan-sik!

654
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,914
Hey, Yang Gwan-sik!

655
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:02,918
Wow, that is loud.

656
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:08,549
Ae-sun!

657
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:14,221
Ae-sun! You're going to fall over.

658
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,807
Come here. Aren't you adorable?

659
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,560
Mommy, I want a candy.

660
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,280
Yang Gwan-sik!

661
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,658
Yang Gwan-sik!

662
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:39,830
Yang Gwan-sik!

663
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:47,171
Yang Gwan-sik.

664
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:49,381
Yang Gwan-sik.

665
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:52,593
Yang Gwan-sik!

666
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:00,601
Don't go!

667
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:03,771
Please don't go.

668
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,952
That damn girl is a real pain.

669
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,329
Stop being so obnoxious!

670
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:22,289
Why don't you stop being so nosy?

671
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:24,500
Let her be.

672
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:26,585
Let her yell and scream.

673
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,596
Why do you take everything from me?

674
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:42,351
Why do you only take everything
that belongs to me?

675
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,649
Mom.

676
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:52,570
Mom.

677
00:42:58,325 --> 00:42:59,785
Mom!

678
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:06,208
Man, what's going on?

679
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:08,586
Is the Dragon King holding us back?

680
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,087
Why is the wind against us?

681
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,881
Damn it. Hey!

682
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:15,593
The wind is against us.

683
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,094
Turn this boat around.

684
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:18,679
- Turn it around!
- We're at sea!

685
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:19,805
Please turn it around!

686
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:21,181
Please turn back!

687
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,183
You have to turn around!

688
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:24,768
Get out of here!

689
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:28,647
Please turn around for just a second!

690
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:32,818
Get off me!

691
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,403
Wait! Please!

692
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:36,947
Why is that little punk on my boat again?

693
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:38,782
The boat, sir!

694
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:40,159
Excuse me, Captain!

695
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,620
You have to turn around.

696
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:45,623
Gwan-sik!
You won't die without her, will you?

697
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,250
Will you die? You fool!

698
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:59,386
<i>If she hadn't run that day…</i>

699
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,390
<i>If she hadn't run…</i>

700
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,726
You're shattering their lives.

701
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:08,520
Don't you know
what happened to Romeo and Juliet?

702
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:12,066
A broken heart doesn't take a life.

703
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:15,903
Once the boat sets sail,
they're in the hands of the Dragon King.

704
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:18,197
What's the point of her draining herself?

705
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:19,698
Let's go.

706
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:23,243
Ae-sun, let's go.
I'll cook you a pork dish.

707
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,079
Pork is better than a boy?

708
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:27,414
My goodness.

709
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,291
Oh my goodness.

710
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:32,002
<i>If she hadn't run that day…</i>

711
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:34,213
Did someone just fall overboard?

712
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:36,548
Did someone just…

713
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:40,177
Mommy, brother go splash.

714
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,261
What?

715
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:44,181
Brother just go splash.

716
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:51,689
"A broken heart doesn't take a life"?

717
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:54,024
It just drove a young man
to jump overboard!

718
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:57,528
Oh no, Mother.

719
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:11,417
<i>If she hadn't run that day…</i>

720
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:17,464
Look! Is that a whale or what?

721
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:20,217
Something is rushing this way!

722
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:27,599
<i>If she hadn't run that day,</i>

723
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:32,396
<i>could she have stopped the destiny</i>
<i>that was rushing toward her?</i>

724
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:44,992
U-turn!

725
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,369
U-turn!

726
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:52,082
All the way, Gwan-sik!

727
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:09,183
Of all the sports,
you just had to teach him to swim!

728
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:14,271
We should send him
to North Korea as an agent!

729
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:24,490
<i>Destiny has always been sassy,</i>
<i>just like that.</i>

730
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:00,526
Goodness me!

731
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,116
Are you okay?

732
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:18,168
I have to pay for these clothes!

733
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:21,630
I have money.

734
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,593
- What did that man say?
- I don't know.

735
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,929
All he does is gobble up sugar cubes.

736
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:46,238
Goodness gracious.

737
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:53,287
This is better
than the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl.

738
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:58,375
You know, the thing is,

739
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:02,880
even the heavens couldn't separate
the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl.

740
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:08,385
Because they had to let the couple meet
on the seventh day of the seventh month.

741
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,721
Your husband couldn't do it either.

742
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:14,725
No one can stop young love.

743
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:31,325
Did you know?

744
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:34,369
Your parents eloped at night.

745
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:36,872
Eloped at night?

746
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,708
Your auntie is drunk again.

747
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,711
They caused a total ruckus.

748
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:45,923
All the seas between Jeju and Busan
were stirred up.

749
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:48,258
Gyeong-ok,
you're confused again from drinking.

750
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:51,011
Your mother eloped at night, not me.

751
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:52,679
But the funny part

752
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,765
is what happened in Busan.

753
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:56,141
Go home now.

754
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:57,184
Time to get up.

755
00:48:57,684 --> 00:49:00,395
- What happened in Busan?
- They were caught in two days.

756
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:02,272
- Enough!
- So how…

757
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:06,568
All right, drink some water and sober up.

758
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:11,406
Hey, can you call Gyeong-ok's husband?

759
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:13,367
Busan worked wonders, I tell you.

760
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,160
- You're a true blessing.
- Gyeong-ok!

761
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:17,496
Do I have to call your husband over?

762
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:18,622
Come on!

763
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:20,582
You arrived earlier than expected.

764
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:24,670
You were born eight months
after the wedding,

765
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:26,797
even though they were caught in two days.

766
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,176
That's why Busan worked wonders.

767
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:32,678
You're such a blessing.

768
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:36,723
That's why your hometown
is Busan, not Jeju.

769
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:41,103
Blame it on spring.

770
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:44,564
Spring has a way of getting to people.

771
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:47,567
<i>Spring in Jeju</i>

772
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:49,736
<i>has always arrived early</i>

773
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:52,614
<i>and has been exceptionally sassy.</i>

774
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:57,202
I think

775
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:00,414
we should have maybe three kids.

776
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:03,166
I think three would be perfect.

777
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:06,253
So, if we're going to pay

778
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:08,839
for the education of all three,

779
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:12,134
we have to be very strategic
about how we live.

780
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:16,263
Have you heard of General MacArthur?

781
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:19,016
So, strategically,

782
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:22,394
we should have a daughter first,

783
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:23,812
then a son--

784
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:25,105
No time to waste, then.

785
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:27,107
What?

786
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:31,862
No time.

787
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:48,837
<i>Were you throwing a wild circus in there?</i>

788
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:52,007
How did you even manage
to break the fan on the wall?

789
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:58,555
Even my mom thinks
Yang Gwan-sik and Oh Ae-sun broke the fan.

790
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:01,850
Hey, go home. You little brat.

791
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:02,851
Go now!

792
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:06,229
I wondered why they called you "Dia"
before you were born.

793
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:09,733
It turns out they drank Dia soju
in Busan before they--

794
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:12,736
If you're drunk, just go, you brat.

795
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:15,489
You're the ones who went to Busan.
Why take it out on me?

796
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:18,658
You're the one
who came into my home and ate chicken.

797
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:20,952
Go home now!

798
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:22,871
There's some left. Don't tell me to go!

799
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:24,623
We'll pack it for you to go. Okay?

800
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:26,666
Put your jacket on. Come on.

801
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:27,584
Go.

802
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:36,676
<i>Geum-myeong. Look over here.</i>

803
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,221
One, two, three!

804
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:46,269
I didn't know a person's head
could be so round.

805
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:47,646
Are you happy?

806
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:50,315
I didn't know you could smile like that.

807
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:53,485
Oh my goodness.

808
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:54,820
Is she that adorable?

809
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:57,280
She is. An adorable rascal.

810
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:00,951
A rascal that held her mother back.

811
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:11,002
Don't be silly.
Who cares about college now?

812
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:14,548
I have the whole world right here
in my arms.

813
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:19,302
You're my nostalgia now, aren't you? Huh?

814
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,560
<i>At the National Sports Festival,</i>

815
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:29,271
<i>a swimmer who wore boxers</i>
<i>instead of swimming trunks</i>

816
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:32,691
<i>won first place</i>
<i>in the 400 m and 1,500 m freestyle.</i>

817
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:36,236
<i>Jo O-ryeon, who burst onto the scene,</i>

818
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:42,409
<i>expressed his ambitious desire to win</i>
<i>the gold medal at the Bangkok Asian Games.</i>

819
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:52,586
Are you sad

820
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:55,839
you couldn't be like Jo O-ryeon?

821
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:03,430
Who cares about a gold medal
when I've got my golden girl?

822
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:07,309
She is my dream now.

823
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:13,481
<i>The spring of their lives</i>
<i>flew by in a heartbeat.</i>

824
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:15,942

THIS IS A SILENT OUTCRY

00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,235
<i>At the age of 18,</i>

826
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:20,447

<i>At the age of 19,</i>

828
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:27,996
<i>my dad got his golden girl</i>
<i>instead of a gold medal.</i>

829
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:31,666
Think she'll be a soccer player?
Look at her legs.

830
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:36,046
I hope she'll be a teacher.
A literature teacher.

831
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:41,426
- I wonder what she'll be.
- I know, right?

832
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:47,974
{\an8}<i>Their spring wasn't a season</i>

833
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:50,435
{\an8}<i>but to break them.</i>

834
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,110
{\an8}<i>And they did so willingly.</i>

835
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:06,201
{\an8}GEUM-MYEONG, OUR ETERNAL NOSTALGIA
MAY 4, 1969

836
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:10,247
WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU TANGERINES

837
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:13,250
Hello, is it okay
if I ask you a few questions?

838
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:17,462
So you're here to see the flowers today.
How do you feel about them?

839
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:21,007
The flowers remind me of my first love.

840
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:23,927
- First love. Of course.
- Go live with her, then.

841
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:27,472
Hye-ran. That's dirty.

842
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:29,975
Well, thank you for the interview.

843
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:31,726
- Hye-ran. It's dirty.
- Okay, then.

844
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,895
Let's interview a few other citizens.

845
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:37,023
Hello. You must be newlyweds.

846
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:45,949
These aren't my grandmother's.
They're really mine.

847
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:48,410
Your first birthday ring
is your mom's, not yours.

848
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:51,246
But I really want to give her a ring.

849
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:53,248
You're so tiresome.

850
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:57,794
Don't look at me like that.

851
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:00,380
I actually snuck out.

852
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:03,466
By dawn tomorrow, could--

853
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:06,553
So you want me to come to work
at dawn because of you?

854
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,478
Fine, leave them here.

855
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:20,692
Who would live with a man without a ring?

856
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,078
Is the restroom clean?

857
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,038
Clean?

858
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:34,539
Yeah.

859
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:36,499
It's usable.

860
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:44,382
A new ring and a new dress.

861
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:47,427
This must be a top celebrity's wedding.

862
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:52,390
Do you really want it?

863
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:54,851
Is this a wedding or a fashion show?

864
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:57,479
You should just rent formal wear.

865
00:55:57,562 --> 00:55:58,480
Seriously.

866
00:55:58,563 --> 00:55:59,564
Wear it.

867
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:01,775
Wear anything you want.

868
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:04,903
Why not wear your top hat
and strut in a parade?

869
00:56:04,986 --> 00:56:06,404
Pick whatever you want.

870
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:08,239
For crying out loud.

871
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:10,575
You like it?

872
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:13,119
Yeah.

873
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:15,038
Do you guys want to move out?

874
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:17,040
If you have the money, just go.

875
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:19,167
Should I put my hair up?

876
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:23,755
Does my hair look better up or down?

877
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:25,757
What?

878
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,008
My hair.

879
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:29,344
Does it look prettier up or down?

880
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:33,598
Actually…

881
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:34,516
Yeah?

882
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:37,018
Don't you think

883
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:39,312
you might regret it

884
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:41,564
in the future?

885
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:43,233
Why?

886
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:47,028
I just think it might be…

887
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:52,659
embarrassing, and…

888
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:59,958
Do you even know anything about fashion?
Do you know who André Kim is?

889
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:01,376
No, I don't.

890
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:06,923
If you have the means, please move out!

891
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:08,216
This is so annoying.

892
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:15,807
By the way,
can we have quail noodle soup after this?

893
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:19,060
You had it just yesterday,
you little piggy.

894
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:27,277
You look beautiful.

895
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:34,367
<i>Mom, why did you wear a hat like that?</i>

896
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:36,744
<i>Was it some kind of dare?</i>

897
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:29,250
"THE SAME SKY, THE SAME STARS,
ETCHED IN THE SAME HEARTS."

898
