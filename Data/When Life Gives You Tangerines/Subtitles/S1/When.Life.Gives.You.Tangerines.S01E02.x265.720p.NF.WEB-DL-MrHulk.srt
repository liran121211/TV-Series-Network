1
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:05,982
WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU TANGERINES

2
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,943
Ae-sun, that brat!

3
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,571
- You brat!
- Mother!

4
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:12,906
- I don't want him!
- Mother.

5
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:14,783
Yang Gwan-sik? No, thank you!

6
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,201
No, thank you!

7
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,621
Damn her! Ae-sun, that brat!

8
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:21,372
Grandma, why are you doing this?

9
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,707
- Why?
- What?

10
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:27,504
Why did you ruin her cabbages
in the first place?

11
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:28,546
Why, you little!

12
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:31,674
She said, "No, thank you."

13
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,240
Barnacles and whelks.

14
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:00,036
A fishmonger's son
and a <i>haenyeo's </i>daughter.

15
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:01,704
Same difference.

16
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,874
Am I a maid dating a prince?

17
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:29,899
Just hanging out doesn't mean
we'll fall for each other.

18
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:35,113
It's all part of business, you know,
so I could set up shop next to your store.

19
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:37,532
It's not like I'm dying to get married.

20
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,078
I wouldn't take you
even if they hand you over.

21
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,081
You think I'm crazy?
Why marry a guy from the island?

22
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,126
In any case, my roots are in Seoul.

23
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,377
Gyeonggi Noodle.

24
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:53,131
Your uncle runs Gyeonggi Noodle.

25
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,799
Gyeonggi-do is practically Seoul.

26
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:03,099
That damn sea swallowed up
my father and mother.

27
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,894
Seeing the waves all around
makes me feel sick.

28
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,312
You think I'd stay here?

29
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:10,940
I will marry a man from Seoul,
no matter what.

30
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,734
Not some guy from the island.

31
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:16,738
Especially not a guy
who doesn't even know what "nostalgia" is.

32
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:17,655
Never!

33
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:25,205
You're as quiet as a mouse.
Why aren't you saying anything?

34
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,208
I'd rather live
with a <i>dolhareubang </i>rock statue<i>.</i>

35
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:32,128
Then take your hand out of my pocket
and put it in a guy's from Seoul.

36
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,442
Give away your son if you want.

37
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:58,738
It seems like you're okay
with giving him to that girl.

38
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:02,242
- I'd never go against you, Mother.
- Oh, you wouldn't?

39
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,245
You came to this family knocked up.

40
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:08,206
Don't push them too hard.
It might lead to an accident.

41
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,999
You know what I mean.

42
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,627
I know. That's why I'm acting like this.

43
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,922
If we leave them alone,
they might elope at night like you did.

44
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:19,050
Your son will also be stolen
right under your nose.

45
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:23,054
Are you saying I stole your son, Mother?

46
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:28,518
Rumors on an island this small
bring nothing but trouble for us all.

47
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,187
Why are you pretending
to be so understanding?

48
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,148
He's just a boy.
They'll hang out for a bit and move on.

49
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,733
Let them be.

50
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:39,112
Once they've had enough, they'll stop.
Why let it get to you?

51
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,863
You know there's nothing you can do.

52
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:45,493
The men in the Yang family
have been fools for generations.

53
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:49,497
They can't tell a snake from a rabbit.
And I'm the mean wench, they say.

54
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,125
Leave them alone.

55
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,337
People pity beggars. They don't love them.

56
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:10,685
Is it mackerel today?

57
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,771
Being pitiful is wonderful.

58
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,357
My life is full of freebies.

59
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,320
If it were out of pity, I'd feed a beggar.

60
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:25,408
The school always gives me
the leftover powdered milk.

61
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,201
Like I should be grateful.

62
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,872
You think I gave you fish
for ten years out of pity?

63
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,333
Then why did you give me them?

64
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,210
You think I've spent ten years
as your minion out of pity?

65
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,087
So why did you give me them?

66
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,965
It's about time you told me why.

67
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,261
What are you looking at?

68
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,597
Look at me when you talk to me!

69
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,684
You only ever feed me.
You never make a move.

70
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:56,022
Did your grandma tell you to hand me fish
and keep your mouth shut?

71
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,734
Did she tell you not to talk to me
in case we get involved…

72
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:10,161
You little punk! You're such a brat.

73
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,541
Do you kiss little punks?

74
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,751
That was my philtrum!

75
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,294
I wouldn't kiss a beggar either.

76
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:20,088
Honestly,

77
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,257
who says they like someone like that?

78
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,801
I won't live with my grandma.

79
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,010
I want to live with you.

80
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:28,971
Seriously,

81
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,226
who on earth would kiss the philtrum
and then say things like…

82
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,353
So stop yapping!

83
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:38,689
I don't know what happened to me.
I can't hear what you're yapping about.

84
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,401
I can just see your yapping mouth.
What should I do?

85
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,153
You're the selfish brat
who puts her hand in my pocket.

86
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,447
- Why are your lips so shiny?
- I put something on!

87
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,490
- Why?
- To be ready.

88
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:48,408
What?

89
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:54,914
I've been ready since I was 14!

90
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,980
SASSY FIRST LOVE

91
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:21,941
<i>The Jeju Canola Flower Festival</i>
<i>has started again this year.</i>

92
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,776
{\an8}<i>Jeju Island is bustling with tourists</i>

93
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,904
{\an8}<i>who have gathered</i>
<i>to see the scenery of the canola flowers.</i>

94
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,239
{\an8}<i>Especially this year,</i>

95
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:31,617
{\an8}<i>a variety of events for couples</i>
<i>are capturing attention.</i>

96
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,745
{\an8}<i>Let's interview some of the visitors here.</i>

97
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,665
{\an8}<i>Hello. Is it okay</i>
<i>if I ask you a few questions?</i>

98
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,168
{\an8}<i>So you're here to see the flowers today.</i>

99
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,919
{\an8}<i>How do you feel about them?</i>

100
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,257
<i>The flowers remind me of my first love.</i>

101
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,134
<i>- First love. Of course.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

102
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,094
<i>Go live with her, then.</i>

103
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,681
<i>Hye-ran, that's dirty.</i>

104
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,642
Mom, was Dad your first love?

105
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:58,936
Was he?

106
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,815
I don't know. I forget.

107
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:05,526
Your first kiss?

108
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,444
Are you insane?

109
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,821
That's our mom you're talking about!

110
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,324
You must be out of your damn mind.

111
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:12,533
Yeah, just get lost.

112
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,453
<i>The flower field is so pretty.</i>

113
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,830
<i>- It is.</i>
<i>- Our Jin-hee is prettier than a flower.</i>

114
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,500
Did you know
canola flowers have a very strong scent?

115
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,837
The scent is so strongly sweet.

116
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:29,592
It gives you such a headache.
You feel like you might faint.

117
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:37,683
I'm hungry!

118
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,770
Why haven't you eaten yet?

119
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,023
Can't you just get rid of this thing?

120
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,734
Dinner will be ready in no time.

121
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,993
Why would you watch something so boring?

122
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,084
MARINATED CHICKEN

123
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,093
<i>Back then,</i>

124
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,221
<i>if I'd known that spring was truly spring,</i>

125
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:19,850
<i>I would've lived my life to the fullest.</i>

126
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,354
I still won't marry you.

127
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:32,280
It's just that, you know,
today's training was so tough...

128
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,698
Shut up and just walk.

129
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:06,606
<i>That bald young man</i>
<i>Commuting at eight o'clock</i>

130
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:15,031
<i>I can't wait to see</i>
<i>If I'll see him again tomorrow</i>

131
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,952
<i>Sun-nam was eating</i>

132
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:24,332
<i>And now she's gone</i>

133
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,337
<i>Sun-nam was eating</i>

134
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:33,883
<i>And now she's hiding</i>

135
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,009
I found you!

136
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,597
<i>Spring is ever so fickle.</i>

137
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,151
<i>Just as it starts to feel warm,</i>
<i>it turns cold.</i>

138
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,281
<i>Just as it feels cold, it turns hot.</i>

139
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,745
<i>It rushes at you so fast,</i>
<i>leaving you dazed.</i>

140
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,877
What did we do wrong?

141
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:11,921
Min-ok.

142
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,551
<i>Morally speaking,</i>

143
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,303
I have never been married.

144
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:23,099
At least my legal marriage record
is clean.

145
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,016
Min-ok.

146
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,687
Why should I have to take care
of your late wife's child?

147
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,647
Are you serving a master?

148
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,108
Why are you trying to save face?

149
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,443
Come next year, you’ll--

150
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,660
Are you serving a master or something?

151
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:07,393
Mom, Jong-gu is your eldest grandson,

152
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,729
even if he drains everything we've got.

153
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,523
He'll perform your annual ancestral rites
after you're gone.

154
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:14,984
What is it?

155
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:16,944
Is something bothering you?

156
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,155
So what if it is?

157
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:22,324
You've cared for that family,
and now you want something from us?

158
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,619
Grandma, don't you have a room?

159
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,831
Do you all sleep and eat in that room?

160
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,167
If your family is struggling like this,

161
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,086
you should work at a factory
or something to help out.

162
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,672
Why are you taking care of another family?

163
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,634
Do they pay you enough for this?

164
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,595
It's not to make a living.

165
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,388
It's just to buy some snacks.

166
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:45,848
And now what?

167
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,349
Are you a literary girl?

168
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,227
You want to go to a college
that even Jong-gu didn't attend?

169
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,105
What?

170
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,900
Do you want to go to college?

171
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:01,071
Mom, do you have savings to give her
when we're in this state?

172
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:04,450
Get that family to pay you as a maid
so you can go to college!

173
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,452
Even if we had plenty of spoiled rice,

174
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,954
we wouldn't give it
to a dog that ran away.

175
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,209
Why did you take them down?

176
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,169
They're not yours! Why did you do it?

177
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:16,796
They're not even yours!

178
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:20,716
You expect me to live with a picture
of his late wife hanging above my head?

179
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:24,887
Sun-nam, Sun-bong. What were you doing
when she took down the picture?

180
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,347
Are ice pops all that matter?

181
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,849
See this girl playing politics?

182
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,560
She's already acting sly
to win them over to her side!

183
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,814
You shouldn't have only bought
four ice pops.

184
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,232
Why would I buy five?

185
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,400
Do I have to please
your late wife's kid too?

186
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,611
- Min-ok.
- Forget it.

187
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:43,280
Morally speaking,
you should show some decency.

188
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:46,033
- Min-ok.
- Yeah, forget it.

189
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:47,576
Give me my money.

190
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,745
Then I'll leave,
even if you beg me to stay.

191
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,163
Wait.

192
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,749
You borrowed money from a child too?

193
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,417
Min-ok!

194
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,211
Would I ever do that?

195
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,629
I would never--

196
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,381
Give me my money for tuition.

197
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:03,467
You said if I raised your kids,
you'd send me to college.

198
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:05,678
I see.

199
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,848
He looked after you
when you had nowhere to go.

200
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,474
Now you want money too?

201
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,352
Give me my money. You promised!

202
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,231
I even sold those cabbages.
Why won't you pay me?

203
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,609
You said you were too scared
of my mom to scam me!

204
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,903
What's scary about a dead wife?

205
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,030
He's scared of his kids
growing up so fast.

206
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,198
Min-ok!

207
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,869
Next year,
he'll have three kids of his own.

208
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,954
Why would he pay your tuition?

209
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:36,375
More importantly,
Yeom Byeong-cheol is dirt poor.

210
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:40,963
Rumor has it that he's living with me
because he can't pay me back.

211
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,048
- Na Min-ok.
- What? Damn you, Byeong-cheol!

212
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:53,267
Don't you get it? He had you fooled.

213
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,395
You're on your own now.

214
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,859
{\an8}Of course, you're on your own now.
What did you expect?

215
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:04,194
{\an8}DECEMBER 1967

216
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,072
Everyone looks out for themselves in life.

217
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,658
Right now, soldering is the best.

218
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:13,037
They teach you a skill, feed you,
pay you, and make you a patriot.

219
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,497
This is your best bet.

220
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,584
{\an8}It's also on the mainland,
just like you've always wanted.

221
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,839
Grind for a few years,
finish the apprenticeship,

222
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,925
and they'll pay you 15,000 won a month.

223
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:29,678
Eat and sleep at the factory,
and you won't have to spend any money.

224
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:35,017
So send us half the money every month.

225
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:36,644
Every single month.

226
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,691
The eldest grandson's debt is also yours.

227
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:46,070
Jong-gu has to do well
for you to find a good husband.

228
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:52,451
It's better to be born a cow
than to be born a woman in Jeju.

229
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,246
That's what my mom said.

230
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:01,585
Jong-gu has been holding
ancestral rites for your father.

231
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,671
What would you know?

232
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,173
Jong-gu's rice is getting cold.

233
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,008
I'm not working at the factory.

234
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:09,593
I won't go.

235
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:14,515
I won't clean up after my siblings
or the eldest grandson.

236
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,308
No one.

237
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,352
If you don't work, where will you go?

238
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:22,147
You want to live in this tiny house
just to add to our troubles?

239
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,234
I won't. I won't do any of it.

240
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,945
If I keep living this way like a fool…

241
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,281
it'll make my mom cry.

242
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,369
Ae-sun,

243
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:37,579
think about it.

244
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,873
Your mom is gone.

245
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,292
Right?

246
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:46,964
There isn't a warm spot waiting
to welcome you in the world.

247
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:16,535
How many rooms do you have?
Can you win against your grandmother?

248
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:20,414
You'd lose, wouldn't you?

249
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,293
What happened? Who upset you this time?

250
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,295
He told me to go to Busan.

251
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,256
He told me to work at a factory!

252
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,800
I don't have a home anymore.

253
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:36,847
Sun-nam and Sun-bong
got won over with ice pops.

254
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,850
My grandma's family is broke.

255
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:44,897
There isn't a warm spot in the world
that will welcome me.

256
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,858
The only person in the world
who cares about me at all

257
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:50,611
is you, Yang Gwan-sik.

258
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,488
So…

259
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:57,159
Why should I?

260
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:01,371
Why do I have to end up
with a guy from the island?

261
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,213
<i>This is a silent outcry</i>

262
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,925
<i>A handkerchief of eternal nostalgia</i>

263
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,052
<i>Waving toward the blue sea</i>

264
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:19,014
<i>I will marry a man from Seoul,</i>
<i>no matter what.</i>

265
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,850
<i>A pure heart flaps like…</i>

266
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:26,188
<i>A pure heart flaps in the wind like waves</i>

267
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:29,441
Especially not a guy
who doesn't even know what "nostalgia" is.

268
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,359
Never!

269
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,611
<i>The first man to hang…</i>

270
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,280
<i>Oh, who could it be</i>

271
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:40,452
<i>The first man to hang</i>
<i>A sad and sorrowful heart in the air</i>

272
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:44,331
So what if you know what "nostalgia" is?

273
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,375
What about college?

274
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,793
What about becoming a poet?

275
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,503
What about the mainland?

276
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,924
I can't give you everything.

277
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:59,680
But there's one thing I will do for you,
no matter what.

278
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,098
Come on.

279
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:06,145
Can't you at least just say
you'll give me everything?

280
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,731
Just tell me you will give me
the moon and the stars!

281
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:14,236
How can I live with someone like this?

282
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,322
I don't know. I can't lie.

283
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:23,203
You'd actually lose to your grandmother,
wouldn't you?

284
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,753
<i>This is a silent outcry</i>

285
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,338
Shut up.

286
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,387
<i>This is a silent outcry</i>

287
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,055
Stop it already!

288
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,100
<i>A handkerchief of eternal nostalgia…</i>

289
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:56,862
{\an8}FEBRUARY 1968

290
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,787
<i>You don't have to fight to win.</i>

291
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,584
<i>Even if you're the pro wrestler</i>
<i>"The Headbutt" Kim Il,</i>

292
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:13,170
<i>it's better to avoid than to fight.</i>

293
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:47,412
<i>I might be running away,</i>
<i>but I must take what I'm owed.</i>

294
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:27,452
Your grandma might want
to put me behind bars.

295
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,429
You won't regret this?

296
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,723
Once we leave Jeju by boat,

297
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,267
there's no backing down.

298
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:52,894
Don't!

299
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,647
There are no take backs in life.

300
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,402
If your life and my life
join together as one,

301
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,654
we stick it out together
whether we live or die.

302
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,410
So if you're scared, walk away now.

303
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,288
Just go back home!

304
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:18,920
In all the 19 years of my life…

305
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,968
I've never felt more excited.

306
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:36,521
- How fast can you run 100 meters?
- Twenty-four seconds?

307
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:38,815
Forget it. Let's go.

308
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:47,699
<i>Who can stop the spring that barges in?</i>

FEMALE RUNAWAY PREVENTION PERIOD

310
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:51,870
<i>Spring in Jeju</i>

00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,498
<i>always seems to come</i>

312
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:56,625
<i>particularly early.</i>

313
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,804
<i>To honor the bloodless May 16 Coup,</i>

<i>across the entire country.</i>

315
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:13,558
<i>For this…</i>

316
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:14,893
<i>That spring,</i>

317
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:19,356
<i>their coup d'état was as ambitious</i>

<i>Even as the nation faced the threat</i>
<i>North Korean Kim Shin-jo's team posed,</i>

320
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:28,198
<i>…but it wasn't as revolutionary</i>
<i>as they'd hoped.</i>

321
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:29,908
Provincial ID.

322
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,080
Provincial ID.

323
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,167
Without any ID,
we'll assume you're with Kim Shin-jo.

324
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,546
You said you were grown-ups.

325
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:44,005
Let's see your IDs.

326
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:48,009
Why are you sitting in the corner,
looking scared?

327
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,594
What are you saying?

328
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:51,221
I don't get it.

329
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,099
Excuse me…

330
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:55,725
You're minors, right?

331
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,271
Sir?

332
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,190
You kids are runaways.

333
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:05,902
How did you end up with her?

334
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,113
What are you saying?

335
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,115
I have no idea what you mean.

336
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,994
Kids today are so shameless.

337
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:16,246
How dare you board this ship
by yourselves?

338
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,584
- Then just throw us overboard.
- What?

339
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,546
Throw us overboard here.

340
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:27,549
What's with the attitude?

341
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:30,927
Do you come from a wealthy family?
Is your father a politician?

342
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:34,473
Throw us off.

343
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,894
What? Who are you?

344
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:40,395
What?

345
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,147
What are you?

346
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,565
Husband and wife.

347
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:47,027
What?

348
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,362
We're husband and wife.

349
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:54,284
We're adults, so we got married.
How can kids get married?

350
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:55,869
Let's go, honey.

351
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:23,563
What are you?

352
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,190
Husband and wife.

353
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,571
What am I meant to do with these?

354
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:34,115
Why are you being so rude to us?

355
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:35,909
Are these even yours?

356
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,994
Are Busan people always rude to customers?

357
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,287
We're all adults here.

358
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,539
Did you steal these?

359
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:41,957
They are his grandmother's.

360
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,259
I need to see some IDs.

361
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:53,343
We left them behind.

362
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:54,844
Yeah, right.

363
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,721
I'm sure you left them behind.

364
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,099
I was born in early 1949.

365
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:00,267
Year of the Tiger?

366
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,310
- Exactly.
- It's actually the Year of the Ox!

367
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:06,773
What are these? Did you steal them?

368
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:10,151
- Are you thieves?
- We're runaways.

369
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:22,956
NAMPOJANG INN

370
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:27,544
<i>We have neither a provincial ID</i>
<i>nor a citizen ID.</i>

371
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:31,089
Our wallets were stolen,

372
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,883
so we don't have anything.

373
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:36,928
Take it out.

374
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:49,316
Maybe we can get a room with this first.

375
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:51,776
Probably not, right?

376
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:55,405
Sort of like a pawn shop?

377
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:56,489
Newlyweds?

378
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,326
You look like newlyweds.

379
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,161
Are you on your honeymoon?

380
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:05,832
That's fine.

381
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,667
You can pay us tomorrow.

382
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:11,588
How generous of you!
Are we running a charity?

383
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:14,341
Your wallets were stolen
on your honeymoon.

384
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:16,176
You must be really upset.

385
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,513
You'll give us a room?

386
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,018
Don't let being robbed upset you.

387
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,812
Busan folks are epically generous.

388
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,669
You could try standing up to her.

389
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,338
Is your grandmother that scary?

390
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,507
I'm not scared of her.

391
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,094
Does standing up to her
make you a bad child,

392
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,970
but running away isn't as bad?

393
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,391
I'm not scared of my grandma.

394
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:07,102
Yeah, right.

395
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,440
I'm scared she'd give you grief.

396
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,327
Are you okay

397
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,830
with giving up on athletics?

398
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:30,041
I'm not even that good.

399
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:33,420
I did it for the free milk and bread.

400
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,214
What are you, a pig?

401
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:45,056
You take the GED test.

402
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:48,184
I'll work at the factory.

403
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:01,281
Do you know
why I'm marrying Yang Gwan-sik,

404
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:03,450
the lamest boy in all of Jeju?

405
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,455
Steel.

406
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,124
You're like steel.

407
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:17,464
We may have hungry days,
but you'll never break my heart.

408
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,553
Even if someone gave me
a gold or silver axe,

409
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:25,430
the steel axe is mine.

410
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,891
The steel axe is the real deal.

411
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:32,020
Nobody would give you
a gold or silver axe anyway.

412
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:35,190
The lamest guy for sure.

413
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:48,411
You said we were married.

414
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,124
Doesn't seem like it.

415
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,589
This doesn't seem like it at all.

416
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:08,473
Yang Gwan-sik.

417
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:14,896
Excuse me.

418
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,622
Why so happy? She stole all your rings.
She took your yellow dress too.

419
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:37,961
You know, the woman at Gwan-sik's house,

420
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,755
her gold frog was taken.

421
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:44,342
She had both her gold frog
and her son taken.

422
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,764
Is that why you're happy?
Do you find it amusing?

423
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,643
The boy's grandmother almost fainted.

424
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:55,395
Man, they're so bold.

425
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:58,481
How did they even think
of running away to Busan?

426
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:01,776
Rumor has it that they caused
quite a scene on that ship.

427
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:07,282
They're saying
Ae-sun led the whole ruckus.

428
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:13,788
Ae-sun is a bit of a romantic, isn't she?

429
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,874
They're lovers on the run, so to speak.

430
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,333
Does romance pay the bills?

431
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:21,462
Once they get hungry,
they'll start resenting each other.

432
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,381
So what if they're hungry?

433
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:27,677
You know, at their age,
they'd be happy to just spend all day

434
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,346
eating tangerines together
on a heated floor.

435
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:32,640
Min-ok.

436
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:35,768
Were you happy?

437
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:39,188
I don't remember
having tangerines with you.

438
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:42,400
Let's do it now.

439
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,069
Hey, you there?

440
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:53,286
Write down what she was wearing.
I heard she stole your clothes.

441
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,371
Are you going after them?

442
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,874
You're like a bounty hunter.
It's a good look for you.

443
00:31:57,957 --> 00:32:01,628
How are you going to find them?
You'll never find them.

444
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:06,466
- Quit rambling and write it down.
- I don't know what she was wearing.

445
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,009
What?

446
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,845
I'm a door-to-door saleswoman.
I have tons of clothes.

447
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,101
It's their first night.

448
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:19,771
Shut your trap!

449
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:24,067
Epically generous, right?

450
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:29,155
This is the crown jewel of Busan.

451
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:32,367
It'd be a shame if you didn't try it.

452
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:36,913
Is this really all on the house?

453
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,249
Well, Busan is a big city.

454
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,544
The floor's all warm now.

455
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:47,715
Enjoy a few glasses of this soju
and have a nice rest.

456
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,635
If you lie on this heated floor
while tipsy,

457
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:54,347
you'll melt like butter in a frying pan.

458
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:57,725
But don't just melt right away.

459
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,187
Take your time.

460
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:04,691
Get busy, if you catch my drift.

461
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:09,946
It is your first night, isn't it?

462
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:15,451
Look at you!
You're both blushing. Get right to it.

463
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,704
You've come to the right place.

464
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:21,290
Even the most inexperienced men
leave this place as experts.

465
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,542
Ma'am!

466
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,168
Oh my.

467
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:25,628
Mind yourself.

468
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:33,553
Give it your all.

469
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:51,446
<i>Give it your all.</i>

470
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:54,991
<i>Give it your all!</i>

471
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:07,837
<i>Jaecheop-guk </i>for sale.

472
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,675
<i>Jaecheop-guk </i>for sale.

473
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,638
<i>Jaecheop-guk </i>for sale.

474
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,685
Yes, over here, please. It's really good.

475
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:32,904
Is the bathroom clean?

476
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:34,822
Clean?

477
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,240
Yeah.

478
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,534
It's usable.

479
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:41,871
Wait.

480
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:43,581
Did you do that?

481
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,759
I think the screw just came loose.

482
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:59,847
Just leave it, then.

483
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,933
What if they ask us to pay for it?

484
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:05,311
Busan folks are epically generous.

485
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,412
BILL
TOTAL: 640 WON

486
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:26,040
Didn't she say
everything was on the house?

487
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:26,958
What?

488
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:31,462
What's this?

489
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:32,964
What is this?

490
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,383
That hurt.

491
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:45,393
What?

492
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:47,562
What's wrong?

493
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,359
What? What is it?

494
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,072
What's wrong?

495
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,199
- Our bags.
- What?

496
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,118
- Where are our bags?
- Bags?

497
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:05,454
<i>No one else got robbed?</i>

498
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:07,665
Were there any strange guests?

499
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:08,916
What are you trying to pull?

500
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:10,835
Sorry?

501
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,504
Quit joking around and pay up.

502
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:16,799
Additional charges for room service
and for breaking the fan mount.

503
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,718
The broken mount is the evidence.

504
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:20,261
- Why would it be broken?
- Yeah!

505
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,555
The thief entered in the dark and--

506
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:25,099
We know! You broke the mount.

507
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,601
We're certain it was you.

508
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:27,518
Why us?

509
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:30,313
One of the guests
might have seen something.

510
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:31,397
- You could ask.
- Yeah.

511
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,107
So they know
people get robbed in this inn?

512
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,359
Well, maybe your wife saw something.

513
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:36,527
- Yeah.
- Sorry?

514
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,780
I never saw any bags at all.

515
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,617
You came here empty-handed.

516
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,701
On the house.

517
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,620
- Hey.
- Yes?

518
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:48,289
Did you see these guys with any bags?

519
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:51,542
Wait, what?

520
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,962
This came from one of the bags.

521
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,505
Only this was left on the floor.

522
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,800
You had no bags, so we took pity on you.

523
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:01,969
Now you want us to give you one?

524
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:06,390
I mean, yesterday, we took our key
after setting down our bag here.

525
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:07,850
You must be really upset.

526
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:11,729
Why don't we just call the police?

527
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:13,856
Should we call

528
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:16,734
and tell them these kids are runaways?

529
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,320
Busan folks are epically generous.

530
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:23,074
This is the crown jewel of Busan.

531
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:25,493
It'd be a shame if you didn't try it.

Ma'am, you may as well
look for a needle in a haystack.

538
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:49,892
How will you find kids
who were determined to run away?

539
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:54,188
I'm running out of coins, Mother.

540
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,607
Stop telling me about your dreams.

541
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,693
I have to go, okay? Bye.

542
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,528
A conception dream?

543
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:07,326
Why would the rooster kidnap the kids?

544
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:11,247
Are you telling me
you want to eat chicken right now?

545

Here's the chicken you ordered.

548
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,504
Enjoy!

549
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:20,131
Do you think I'm an idiot?

550
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,591
Did you think you had me fooled?

551
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:26,429
Why did you give us a room and alcohol
if we had no bags or money?

552
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,596
Quit yapping.

553
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,266
Let's call the police now.

554
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:34,020
They'll call your mother in Jeju
and tell her to come here.

555
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,688
I need to teach this girl a lesson.

556
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,732
How did you know we were from Jeju?

557
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:44,363
Go. Yeah, just leave.

558
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,824
- I'll just think of it as bad luck.
- Hold on!

559
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:49,618
How did you know that we're from Jeju?

560
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:53,706
Should we call the police
and go over the details one by one?

561
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:54,665
The boat tickets.

562
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,710
You found them
in the bags you stole, right?

563
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:00,087
You birdbrain.

564
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:01,505
You birdbrain.

565
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:04,633
My suitcase.

566
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:07,928
Our bags!

567
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,514
Give them back to us!

568
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:12,558
They're all we have left.

569
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:18,105
My mom's picture is in that suitcase.

570
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,940
My suitcase.

571
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:23,694
You kept the room warm,
kept pouring us drinks,

572
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:27,448
and made us "melt like butter"
just to steal our bags!

573
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,950
They stole all those towels too.

Thieving… bitch.

577
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:38,417
Got any proof?

578
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,170
You saw our boat tickets.

579
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:42,463
So what if we did?

580
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:43,798
Got any proof?

581
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:44,715
Got any proof?

582
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:47,635
Scram while we're still being nice.

583
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:51,305
Or we'll sell you both to God knows where.

584
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:55,184
Scram while we're still being nice.

585
00:39:57,978 --> 00:40:00,231
Those bags were all we had.

586
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:06,195
That was the only picture I had of my mom.

587
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:09,990
The gold frog was in there too.

588
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:14,829
It's not like we're beggars or anything.

589
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:18,707
We're like those kids in the fairy tale

590
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:21,961
who were lured by breadcrumbs
and captured by a witch.

591
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:25,339
I don't know what that is.

592
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,134
<i>Hansel and Gretel.</i>

593
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:30,928
Never heard of it.

594
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:37,852
I always thought
they were the biggest idiots.

595
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,896
They lost their minds over the food

596
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:44,358
and had no idea
they were about to be devoured.

597
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,532
What happened to those kids?

598
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,451
Did they survive?

599
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:55,536
Killed.

600
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:58,122
The witch killed them?

601
00:40:58,205 --> 00:40:59,039
No.

602
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:01,500
They killed her.

603
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:06,755
The children threw…

604
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:10,593
the witch into an oven

605
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:13,137
and burned her alive.

606
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:15,598
Ae-sun.

607
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,141
They killed her,

608
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:21,187
took all her silver, gold, and treasures,

609
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:25,232
and lived happily ever after.

610
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:27,902
Oh Ae-sun.

611
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:30,529
Those kids were really something.

612
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:49,465
It's all on the house.

613
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:51,550
Busan folks are epically generous.

614
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:54,428
Have a drink in this warm room,

615
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:57,556
and you'll melt like butter
in a frying pan.

616
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,935
This right here is--

617
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,520
What happened to that?

618
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:04,855
Damn it!

619
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,566
Yesterday, some lunatics came in here

620
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,276
and caused a total ruckus!

621
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,405
- Let me climb on your back.
- Okay.

622
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:14,323
Hurry.

623
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:17,576
Those little punks came in here
and made us flip out.

624
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,538
I wanted to throttle them,
but I let them go.

625
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,748
We're decent folks, you know?

626
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:48,357
What is it now?

627
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:52,027
Excuse me.

628
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:55,406
I don't need any more free stuff.

629
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:56,323
That free stuff--

630
00:42:56,407 --> 00:43:00,202
If you get drunk, they'll rob you.
She said you'll melt like butter, right?

631
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:02,454
What are you saying?

632
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:05,457
Don't turn the lights off, no matter what.

633
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,101
Why isn't that girl sleeping?

634
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:35,112
Well, we're not making any money tonight.

635
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,657
Charge her double for the soju.

636
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,301
The gold frog and my mom's picture
come first, got it?

637
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,554
We look for our stuff first.

638
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:03,182
If we can't find it,
we take their cashbox, okay?

639
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:08,896
We'd still be in the red.

640
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:10,522
That gold frog is worth way more.

641
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,399
It's not like we're stealing.

642
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:20,824
It was all we had for our future, right?

643
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:25,079
Gwan-sik.

644
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:28,165
You're the head of our family now, okay?

645
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:37,675
Honey.

646
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:43,931
Honey.

647
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:51,230
Let's go.

648
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:21,343
It's not there.

649
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,053
Not there.

650
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:43,073
Don't do it. Get the cashbox.

651
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:45,200
The cashbox.

652
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,302
Let's just go.

653
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:47,513
Let's go. I'll buy you another one.

654
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:07,866
Hey!

655
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:11,203
- The cashbox.
- Hey, lady!

656
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:12,120
Put it down.

657
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:15,290
- Right, 24 seconds.
- Put the cashbox down.

658
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:17,376
- Damn it, you punk.
- Put the cashbox down!

659
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:19,670
I swear I'll beat this girl to a pulp!

660
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:23,674
I'm done for. Just go!

661
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:24,925
Go!

662
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:25,843
Just go!

663
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:29,054
You want us to sell this girl to a place
where no one can find her?

664
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,850
Lady, that's the pit of my stomach.

665
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:35,644
My stomach.

666
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:38,480
Put it down before I lose it.

667
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:40,232
- Come at me.
- Put it down!

668
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:41,608
Come at me.

669
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:47,865
Okay, let up a bit.

670
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,324
- I'm dying!
- Hey, be quiet.

671
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,368
Put it down. Now!

672
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:52,744
- Lady.
- Look at that punk.

673
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:55,622
That's right. Just go.

674
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:58,500
- Put it down!
- Run along just like that, punk.

675
00:47:58,584 --> 00:47:59,543
Off you go, punk.

676
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:01,545
Go!

677
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:05,591
Seriously!

678
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:07,509
I told you to put it down, punk!

679
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,137
That's right. There you go.

680
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:13,891
What the hell is he doing?
