1
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,982
WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU TANGERINES

2
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:12,322
Now we have a house

3
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,908
and a boat.

4
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,328
This is crazy.

5
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,164
Are you happy?

6
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,082
Yeah.

7
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:25,877
I'm so happy.

8
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,348
Stop it.

9
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:52,487
<i>It was the brightest season</i>
<i>that would never return.</i>

10
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:59,369
LIFE GOES ON AND ON

11
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,979
HALLIM DISASTER RELIEF
DEPUTY CHIEF OH AE-SUN

12
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:35,321
BABY FORMULA

13
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:50,295
I have to live up to my title, right?

14
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,761
I'm the deputy chief, after all.

15
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,723
Let's add two more. I'm the deputy chief.

16
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,534
Seriously, you little troublemaker!

17
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,997
I told you I'd give you candy
after you finish your <i>sujebi</i>, didn't I?

18
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,459
Why don't you ever listen to Mommy?

19
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:33,421
Mommy, give me a hug.

20
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,300
Mommy, give me a hug.

21
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:40,762
Mommy, give me a hug.

22
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:43,556
Ms. Oh! Geum-myeong was in an accident!

23
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,099
- Mommy.
- What?

24
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,476
Mommy.

25
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,314
Is she bleeding?

26
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,441
I don't know. It's that way.

27
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:59,489
Auntie! Please watch my kids, okay?

28
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,525
Are you the Dragon King's daughter?

29
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:39,904
Wild dolphins mean a storm is coming,
and you're riding your bike?

30
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,366
The motorcycle hit me. I didn't hit it.

31
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,203
Jeju's winds can flip cars, you know?

32
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,872
This tiny thing would be flipped
a hundred times.

33
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,216
Auntie!

34
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:03,553
Auntie!

35
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,226
Auntie!

36
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,603
What about my kids?

37
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,607
Did you put them to bed?

38
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,526
Come again? Which kids?

39
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,078
Eun-myeong!

40
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,874
Why did you leave the boys alone?

41
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,876
It wasn't even a big accident.

42
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,461
- Eun-myeong.
- Eun-myeong!

43
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:37,462
Baby!

44
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,380
- Dong-myeong!
- Eun-myeong! Dong-myeong!

45
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,715
- Dong-myeong!
- Baby!

46
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:42,425
Baby!

47
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:43,343
Eun-myeong!

48
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,928
Eun-myeong!

49
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,598
Eun-myeong…

50
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,524
Grandma always said
once boys start running,

51
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,401
they'll go everywhere!

52
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,320
- Remember?
- Their shoes.

53
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:04,697
They aren't here.

54
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,494
I'll go to the cabbage field.

55
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:12,455
- Ae-sun! Pay me for my green laver.
- You can keep looking.

56
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,625
I had to bring your eldest son,

57
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,878
so I missed out on harvesting the laver.

58
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,838
You're driving me crazy.

59
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:25,051
Didn't I tell you to stay in the house?

60
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:29,889
He was standing alone
on the seawall looking for you.

61
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:34,018
What were you thinking,
going there on your own?

62
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:38,481
The truck auntie would have come for you.
Why couldn't you just wait and…

63
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,735
If you stand there,
the waves will swallow you up.

64
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:46,697
Even cows are swept away by Jeju typhoons.
You must be careful!

65
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:48,783
And Dong-myeong?

66
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:55,206
- Where is Dong-myeong?
- At home.

67
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,251
Wasn't Dong-myeong with you?

68
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,462
At home!

69
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:08,010
What are you saying? You're scaring me!

70
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,764
Mommy, give me a hug.

71
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,976
- Is she bleeding?
- Mommy.

72
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,344
Geum-myeong,

73
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,222
call the fishing co-op office.

74
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,903
Who can stop the summer's whims?

75
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:11,032
Just yesterday, it was bright and sunny
like a newlywed bride.

76
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:15,161
Then it suddenly turns aggressive,
like a wife losing her temper.

77
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:19,499
A wife you can replace,
but you can't hide from the summer frenzy.

78
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,084
For God's sake.

79
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:23,711
Crap!

80
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,088
Good God.

81
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,758
He's building a retaining wall
with his mouth.

82
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,929
Gwan-sik!

83
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,771
Baby! Dong-myeong!

84
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:43,314
Dong-myeong!

85
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:46,651
Dong-myeong!

86
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,736
Dong-myeong!

87
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:53,282
- Yang Dong-myeong!
- Dong-myeong!

88
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,575
Dong-myeong!

89
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,538
Dong-myeong!

90
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:59,664
Yang Dong-myeong!

91
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,624
Dong-myeong!

92
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,378
Dong-myeong!

93
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,925
- Dong-myeong!
- Dong-myeong!

94
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,594
- Dong-myeong!
- Dong-myeong!

95
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,263
- Yang Dong-myeong!
- Dong-myeong!

96
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:18,808
Where did he go? Dong-myeong!

97
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,811
Dong-myeong!

98
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,147
Dong-myeong! Baby!

99
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,819
Yang Dong-myeong! Baby!

100
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,238
Dong-myeong!

101
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,866
Yang Dong-myeong!

102
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,912
Please have mercy on us.
Whatever it takes, spare the child.

103
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,999
Please spare our baby.
Send him back to us.

104
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,668
Please send our baby back to us.

105
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,550
Losing a child takes
only a moment's lapse.

106
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,176
Please save my grandson.

107
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,679
Do you know
what everyone in the world says

108
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,223
when they lose their children?

109
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:02,393
- Dong-myeong. My baby.
<i>- They all say the same thing.</i>

110
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,854
<i>They say it happens</i>
<i>in the blink of an eye.</i>

111
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,607
<i>They lost their child</i>
<i>in the blink of an eye!</i>

112
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:15,698
Did you find him? Did they?

113
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,327
- Ae-sun.
- Did you find him?

114
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:22,955
Ae-sun.

115
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,211
Ae-sun.

116
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,756
What?

117
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:33,716
What?

118
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,208
Hospital.

119
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,461
We need to go to the hospital.

120
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:12,672
Oh dear.

121
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:15,758
My baby's cold.

122
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,847
Why won't anyone call an ambulance?

123
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:27,603
Dong-myeong.

124
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,188
Baby.

125
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:30,648
Baby.

126
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,191
Dong-myeong.

127
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:34,902
Dong-myeong.

128
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:36,612
Baby.

129
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:38,406
Baby.

130
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,491
What's wrong with him?

131
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,202
Baby.

132
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,580
The doctor.

133
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,626
We need to call the doctor.

134
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:06,183
Gwan-sik, call an ambulance.

135
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:10,312
Why won't anyone call an ambulance?

136
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,733
No one's calling an ambulance.

137
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,740
<i>On the day their world collapsed…</i>

138
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,752
<i>for the first time…</i>

139
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,174
<i>their Steelheart collapsed.</i>

140
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:42,780
<i>A father's weeping drowned out the waves.</i>

141
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,491
I should've hugged him.

142
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,165
I should've hugged him.

143
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,294
<i>The son she had fed lunch</i>

144
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,631
<i>was no longer the same by dinner.</i>

145
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:29,762
Mommy, give me a hug.

146
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:31,805
Mommy, give me a hug.

147
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:33,974
<i>Mommy, give me a hug.</i>

148
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,393
<i>Mommy, give me a hug.</i>

149
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:39,188
Mommy, give me a hug.

150
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,865
I should've hugged him while I could.

151
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,412
I should've…

152
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:19,770
<i>Grandma didn't utter a word of blame</i>
<i>toward Mom during the funeral.</i>

153
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:25,234
<i>She said a mother who has lost her child</i>
<i>sheds more tears than the sea.</i>

154
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:38,706
Keep living.

155
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,834
What choice do you have?

156
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:46,171
You have two children
who still need to be fed.

157
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,802
Life will go on if you keep living.

158
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:53,762
Life will go on and on.

159
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,474
<i>Life goes on and on.</i>

160
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,602
<i>There will be tougher days in your life.</i>

161
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:06,358
One day, life might get so tough
that you feel like you can't go on--

162
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,027
I told you to stop talking!

163
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:10,112
I won't promise.

164
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,781
I'm not going to eat abalone.

165
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:18,454
My precious little one.

166
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:21,999
When will you grow up?

167
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:33,927
Ae-sun.

168
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,598
If life gets so tough
that you feel like you can't go on,

169
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,558
remember me, who dived every day.

170
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:48,108
<i>Those who make a living on land</i>
<i>mention dying over the slightest hardship.</i>

171
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,361
<i>But no matter how tough life gets,</i>

172
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,156
a <i>haenyeo </i>would never say that.

173
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:59,870
<i>I've come close to death countless time</i>
<i>in those fierce waters, and each time,</i>

174
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:03,207
<i>I found countless reasons to keep living.</i>

175
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,666
Then keep living.

176
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:06,710
You should live on.

177
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,546
Why die with countless reasons to live?

178
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,803
Your mind can't weep
if your body is weary.

179
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:20,599
One day, life might get so tough
that you feel like you can't go on.

180
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,518
Don't just lie still.

181
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,770
Struggle with all your might.

182
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,814
<i>Stomp wash your blanket.</i>

183
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:30,192
<i>Plow the field or even do odd jobs</i>
<i>to earn some money.</i>

184
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:34,154
Tell yourself you won't die
and must survive, no matter what.

185
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,907
<i>Paddle your arms and legs like crazy.</i>

186
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,537
<i>You'll get through the dark waters</i>

187
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,498
<i>and see the sky.</i>

188
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,753
You'll be able to breathe again.

189
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,071
You can do it?

190
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,074
It'd be sweet, right?

191
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,041
That looks so good.

192
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,598
Is that what you wanted to eat?

193
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:48,020
Is that what you've been craving?

194
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:54,568
Why won't you talk to me?

195
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:57,905
Are you mad at Mommy?

196
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,952
Yang Eun-myeong.

197
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,871
I asked why you won't talk to me.

198
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,168
Are you never gonna talk to me again?

199
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:31,790
SCHOOL SUPPORT FEES DUE BY THE 20TH

200
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,766
Why didn't you show us the perfect score?

201
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,103
Why didn't you show them off to me?

202
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:00,986
Geum-myeong.

203
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:05,532
<i>What's wrong?</i>

204
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:07,701
Are you mad at Mommy?

205
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,329
You won't talk because you're mad at me?

206
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:12,748
Is it because…

207
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:15,792
Is it because…

208
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,340
I didn't bring your brother back?

209
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:25,260
Are you not talking to me
because you're mad at me?

210
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,139
Because you're angry.

211
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,393
What was that?

212
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:36,605
I left my brother behind.

213
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:38,982
That's why he's dead.

214
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,368
It's because…

215
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:51,995
It's because…

216
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,623
I went to ride my bike.

217
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:59,586
If I hadn't gone to ride my bike,
Dong-myeong would still be alive.

218
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,088
I was told…

219
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,342
not to ride my bike
because of the typhoon,

220
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:10,263
but I still went to ride it.

221
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,474
That's why Dong-myeong is dead.

222
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:18,897
<i>Mom and Dad said</i>

223
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:24,236
<i>that was when they came to their senses.</i>

224
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,450
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

225
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:32,494
I'm so sorry.

226
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:34,871
I'm sorry.

227
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,541
It's all my fault.

228
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:39,793
<i>I'm sorry, Eun-myeong.</i>

229
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:17,747
<i>The Steelheart picked himself up</i>
<i>after three days.</i>

230
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:20,542
<i>He finished his mountain of rice</i>

231
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,545
<i>and then simply went out to sea.</i>

232
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:39,102
Geum-myeong,

233
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:41,354
tell your teacher

234
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:44,858
Dad will pay the school support fees
in three days.

235
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:51,281
Okay?

236
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:57,037
<i>They were allowed three days to mourn.</i>

237
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:00,248
<i>Just three days.</i>

238
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:08,048
Dad, what will you catch today?

239
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:11,343
Brown croakers. Summer brown croakers.

240
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,012
- Brown croakers?
- Yes.

241
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,557
I won't sell them. I'll bring them home.

242
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:19,476
- Our home?
- Yeah.

243
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:24,022
Let's have them for dinner tonight.

244
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,942
Let's eat together.

245
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:21,997
You're not eating?

246
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:24,624
She sold everything and is packing up now.

247
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,421
She has her back to the sea,
but she still sells well, right?

248
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:34,009
She can't even stand the sight
of that damn sea.

249
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,429
But just how clear is that sea?

250
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:42,142
It looks so clear and peaceful,
as if nothing happened,

251
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:44,144
that it makes her want to vomit.

252
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,694
The sea took her mother,
her father, and now her son.

253
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:56,114
Imagine how she feels
having to make a living from that sea.

254
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:01,494
She's enduring life with a heart
crudely stitched back together.

255
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:05,498
The Dragon King sure is fickle, isn't he?

256
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,251
He's taken everything she holds dear,

257
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,965
yet he keeps giving her things
as if to say, "I still won't let you die."

258
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,635
I'm grateful to that little one.

259
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:19,179
I'm grateful she's carrying on.

260
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,599
Did you sell all the squid?

261
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,602
I managed to catch
a longtooth grouper today.

262
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:29,981
If we sell it,
we could easily make 1,000 won.

263
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,489
More than enough
to buy Eun-myeong a new backpack.

264
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,532
It's so unfair.

265
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,623
It's all so unfair.

266
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:57,300
Geum-myeong. Eun-myeong. Let's go.

267
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,027
I really don't want

268
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:19,906
anything to do with that damn sea.

269
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,369
It's so unfair.

270
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:28,748
Ae-sun.

271
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:31,835
Let's stop crying.

272
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:38,258
If Mom and Dad keep crying,
it will cast a shadow over the children.

273
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,218
They'll be anxious.

274
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:44,180
I just want this damn summer to be over.

275
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:48,226
It's so annoying how fickle it is.

276
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,479
When it's bright, it's too bright.

277
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,940
When it rains, it pours.

278
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:58,653
Summer allows everything on land
and at sea to thrive,

279
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,406
and then it brings storms that crush them.

280
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,283
We're completely helpless.

281
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,702
<i>The two-faced summer</i>

282
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:10,039
<i>brought my young parents to their knees.</i>

283
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:13,293
Why does it have to be so harsh?

284
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,504
If it were me, I'd go easy.

285
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:22,135
Even drivers cut beginners some slack.

286
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:26,139
Everything is a first for me too.

287
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:30,518
Why can't it go easy on me?

288
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:34,272
<i>Like the grass flattened by a typhoon…</i>

289
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:37,567
How can we move on from this?

290
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:41,404
<i>…they fell down but got back up again.</i>

291
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:45,533
Still, the summer's fickleness
will help us go on.

292
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:51,831
Grass and trees knocked down
by the summer typhoon

293
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:53,750
eventually rise again.

294
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:59,130
Rain may pour
as if it would sweep everything away.

295
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:05,553
But once the sun starts blazing again,
life rises again, no matter what.

296
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:08,181
Everything on land and at sea.

297
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:13,770
What if I can't go on?

298
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:19,859
I keep thinking I can't go on.

299
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:24,656
- There are crabs here.
- Crabs?

300
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:26,241
We have to save the kids.

301
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,284
You can't catch that.

302
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,251
Gwan-sik.

303
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:44,676
It was my fault.

304
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,137
I was the one…

305
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:53,852
who'd put Dong-myeong on the seawall.

306
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:09,158
Ever since he turned one,
I'd carry him to greet you on the seawall.

307
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,581
I'd line the kids up and tell them,

308
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,418
"If we stand here, Dad will come."

309
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,675
I told them
that even if there was rain or wind,

310
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:30,138
you'd come back to us if we waited there.

311
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:40,982
I told them that.

312
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:47,030
Our Dong-myeong…

313
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,494
died because of me.

314
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,170
It was all my fault.

315
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:11,554
The heavens and the Dragon King are harsh.
They're to blame.

316
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,187
It's not your fault at all.

317
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:20,688
Okay?

318
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:25,193
No one in our family is to blame.
No one at all.

319
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:32,158
<i>Dad kept telling himself that,</i>
<i>but deep down, he did resent someone.</i>

320
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:40,166
<i>Mom said she found out</i>
<i>who he resented 30 years later.</i>

321
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:49,550
Hey.

322
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,010
ENDOSCOPY CENTER

323
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:54,305
Do you know what your dad muttered?

324
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:58,977
Did he speak gibberish?

325
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,604
People do that during endoscopies.

326
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:10,238
What, did he mention another woman?

327
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:16,285
Retaining wall.

328
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:18,955
What? "Retaining wall"?

329
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:20,832
<i>Gwan-sik!</i>

330
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:22,500
Gwan-sik!

331
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:25,920
<i>"I shouldn't have gone</i>
<i>to build the retaining wall."</i>

332
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,465
<i>"I shouldn't have gone."</i>

333
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,301
<i>That's what he said.</i>

334
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,225
No one else has a heart of steel like him.

335
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:42,353
Once something enters him,
it will never escape.

336
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,647
He keeps it all bottled up inside.

337
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,650
I don't know how he keeps going.

338
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,486
How did you both keep going?

339
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:55,950
What, then? Give up?

340
00:33:56,743 --> 00:34:01,539
We still had two kids
with twinkling eyes watching us.

341
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,377
I guess we saved you and Dad.

342
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:09,005
Of course you did.

343
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,841
You saved us.

344
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,223
<i>If it weren't for you…</i>

345
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:22,101
<i>If it weren't for you guys…</i>

346
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:26,647
NAME OF THE DECEASED: YANG DONG-MYEONG

347
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:37,909
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD: YANG GWAN-SIK

348
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:41,579
RELATIONSHIP TO HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD: SON

349
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:49,879
DATE OF BIRTH: SEPTEMBER 6, 1974

350
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:59,055
3 YEARS OLD

351
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:24,747
<i>No words can describe</i>
<i>the pain of losing your child.</i>

352
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,380
<i>He couldn't even cry openly anywhere.</i>

353
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:36,342
<i>His heart was completely shattered.</i>

354
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,733
You can't eat <i>dalgona </i>as a meal.

355
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:57,572
I already finished all my food.

356
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,949
Right. Stop eating.

357
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:11,002
<i>I wondered how we'd ever go on.</i>

358
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:14,881
What could you possibly have eaten?

359
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,469
I eat every day.

360
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,763
They usually bring meat too.

361
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:37,528
<i>We were able to go on</i>
<i>thanks to the people who fed us.</i>

362
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,700
<i>A canola flower never blooms alone.</i>

363
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:44,493
<i>They bloom in a bunch.</i>

364
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:49,165
<i>If I had been alone,</i>
<i>I would have broken down countless times.</i>

365
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,298
<i>Just like it takes a village</i>
<i>to raise a child,</i>

366
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:01,427
<i>it takes a village to save a single life.</i>

367
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,567
They'll be fine.

368
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,569
The cooking steam means they'll survive.

369
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:26,994
Don't be so obvious.
They might not like too much sympathy.

370
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:30,539
So I shouldn't give these to them, then?
They're the hens' first laid eggs.

371
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:35,127
Give them the eggs.
Pullet eggs will give them strength.

372
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,296
These eggs are nothing.

373
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:40,341
You're the one who gave away all our rice.

374
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,969
You're the one
who gave them all our octopuses!

375
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,893
So I was just wondering…

376
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,145
I mean…

377
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,731
Some rice--

378
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,858
I don't understand what you're saying.

379
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:00,236
Stop whining.

380
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:02,280
There are many worse off than you.

381
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:11,664
It was you, wasn't it?

382
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,041
The rice jar.

383
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:17,545
I don't know what you're talking about.

384
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,676
What do you mean you don't know?

385
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,177
I know you do.

386
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:29,473
The rice jar was filling up,
not emptying out.

387
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:40,651
<i>I saw that the rice jar was empty</i>
<i>before I went to bed.</i>

388
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,320
<i>I swear I saw it.</i>

389
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:59,628
<i>Every morning, there was a little more,</i>
<i>then a little more.</i>

390
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:04,300
<i>I thought I might not have seen it clearly</i>
<i>since it was nighttime.</i>

391
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:06,427
<i>But it wasn't just for a day or two.</i>

392
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:09,472
<i>There was always</i>
<i>just enough for a family of three.</i>

393
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,307
<i>It just didn't make sense.</i>

394
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:14,060
<i>Just enough to confuse me.</i>

395
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:16,187
<i>It was the exact amount for three.</i>

396
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:20,733
Why do I bother?

397
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:22,860
Why do I even bother?

398
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:30,576
This isn't some magical jar,
and I'm not a fool.

399
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:32,578
It also gave her a headache.

400
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:35,915
If she had just given it to you,
you wouldn't have taken it.

401
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:39,377
It gave her a headache,
trying to sneak you little bits at a time.

402
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:42,338
If it was such a headache--

403
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:46,133
Who would want to see
a pregnant woman go hungry?

404
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,347
You go steam the octopus.

405
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,099
I found it on my way home.

406
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:57,269
Why do you keep taking care
of my mom's ancestral rites?

407
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:00,689
If there's no octopus on your mom's table,
she'll scold you.

408
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:05,152
Have you ever seen a <i>haenyeo</i>
diving on her own?

409
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:09,532
When you're struggling to breathe
in the dark waters,

410
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:13,494
you need to stay close to others
to survive.

411
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:16,205
Or fear will grip your heart,
and you won't make it.

412
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:19,125
No one can live on their own.

413
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:21,127
Go together, with others.

414
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,045
If you do, 100 miles will feel like ten.

415
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:29,760
GO TOGETHER, WITH OTHERS.
IF YOU DO, 100 MILES WILL FEEL LIKE TEN.

416
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:37,810
Gyeong-ja. That's Gwang-rye's daughter's.

417
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:43,274
- Ae-sun is going to give birth soon.
- I'll give it to her.

418
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:47,653
It's been a while,
so I just wanted to touch it.

419
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:49,447
Right?

420
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:01,041
{\an8}Please write "Moral scholarship."

421
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:05,754
If you write that, she'll understand.

422
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:14,763
"Mo-ral."

423
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:16,765
"Scholarship."

424
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:21,812
Is this right?

425
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:25,941
MO O-RAN SCHOLARSHIP
10,000 WON

426
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:32,907
Is it wrong? Three months' rent
for the baby's family, right?

427
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,627
Can you not read?

428
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:51,342
One, two, three, four.

429
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:53,135
One, ten, hundred, thousand.

430
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:57,723
It's right. It's fine.

431
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:04,647
Dear me.

432
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:09,485
If only I hadn't hidden in that closet.

433
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,904
Why did you pay their rent?

434
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:16,909
I guess it's my fate
to live with wonder women.

435
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,870
Don't you have any shame?

436
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:23,832
Sure, I might deserve to be slapped
for what I've done.

437
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:27,336
But you've done nothing wrong.
Love is not a sin, you know?

438
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:30,714
Stop talking crap.

439
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,509
Get your act together, okay?

440
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,220
Karma is straightforward.

441
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:39,890
Beasts raise beasts,
and nobility breeds nobility.

442
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:43,727
Children perfectly inherit
their parents' traits.

443
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:44,687
Min-ok,

444
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:46,146
that's enough.

445
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:48,232
She must have hated me.

446
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:52,319
I ruined Oh Ae-sun's adolescence.

447
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:55,906
I suppose I'm slyly trying to make up
for it with just 10,000 won.

448
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,449
I gave her the cabbage field.

449
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,952
That field of rocks?
That field of dog crap?

450
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:03,038
It was Ae-sun's small hands
that plowed the entire field.

451
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:07,293
And her mother owned that field
in the first place.

452
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:09,295
Min-ok.

453
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:11,547
You can run your mouth,
but have some decency.

454
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,132
Quit talking rubbish.

455
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:15,884
Min-ok, I told you to stop.
I can get mad too.

456
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,804
Now that I've raised kids,

457
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:23,892
I think even you, of all damn people,
should have paid for Ae-sun's college.

458
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:27,187
Come on, that damn college. She can go!

459
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:32,067
Tell her to go now. I'll pay for it,
even if I have to take out a loan.

460
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:35,112
How could she go to college now? How?

461
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:36,780
{\an8}Just tell her to get into one!

462
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,699
{\an8}I'll lay down money before her!

463
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,327
{\an8}Say nothing if she doesn't get in.

464
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:45,205
{\an8}She doesn't need a degree to be a captain,
deputy chief, or whatever.

465
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,876
She'll only get ripped off in Seoul.

466
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:51,420
The best she'll get is a doctorate.

467
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,006
She'll just bleed the family dry.

468
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:57,801
Yes, the government office will hang
a congratulatory banner for her,

469
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,720
but what's the point of all that?

470
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:03,432
Geum-myeong.

471
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:08,604
Hey, you're home.

472
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,652
Did you get in?

473
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,278
Did you not?

474
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:18,572
Mom!

475
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:21,784
If I didn't get in, who else could?

476
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:24,745
Come on. Look at it.

477
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:27,247
"Yang Geum-myeong."
It's got my name on it.

478
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:30,292
Goodness me.

479
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,421
Hey! Let's sell the boat!

480
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,885
You did it, you did.

481
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:46,392
I'm not sure
if it's okay for me to say this.

482
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:52,523
I never thought I'd say this ever again.

483
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:54,233
I'm…

484
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:55,192
Are you happy?

485
00:44:57,986 --> 00:44:58,821
I am.

486
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:00,948
Beyond words.

487
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:05,786
I'm so happy!

488
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:09,915
{\an8}CERTIFICATE OF ADMISSION

489
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:13,502
{\an8}Okay. One, two, three.

490
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:19,174

AFFORDABLE ROOM FOR RENT

492
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:21,802
RENT NEAR SNU
AFFORDABLE ROOM

493
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:26,807
Geum-myeong!

494
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:40,487
Is your child's name Geum-myeong?

495
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:42,823
So is someone in our family.

496
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:46,618
Your son's name is Geum-myeong?

497
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:47,536
No.

498
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:48,954
Mine is.

499
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:50,998
I'm Geum-myeong.

500
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,417
I'm Park Geum-myeong.

501
00:45:58,046 --> 00:45:59,298
Really?

502
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:00,924
What an interesting coincidence.

503
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:01,925
YALASHANG FILM CLUB

504
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:03,218
What about <i>jjajangmyeon?</i>

505
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:06,889
So, what's your major?

506
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:08,474
Well, law is--

507
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:11,810
Aren't we having <i>jjajangmyeon?</i>
Let's take the pictures and go.

508
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:14,396
Let me take it
if you all want one together.

509
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,064
That's so nice of you.

510
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:18,901
Okay, you take ours, and I'll take yours.

511
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:22,571
- Take whose picture? Why?
- Let's take it. Come on.

512
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:26,658
Thank you.

513
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:31,663
Here we go. One, two, three.

514
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:35,584
I'll take one more.

515
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:40,214
Smile.

516
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:44,051
One, two, three!

517
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:46,970
I didn't like him.

518
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:50,140
I told you I didn't like that punk,
didn't I?

519
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:51,767
What's wrong?

520
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,485
When did Geum-myeong take a solo photo?

521
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:05,280
That son of Park Geum-myeong
zoomed in on Geum-myeong.

522
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:06,448
He zoomed in on her!

523
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:08,325
I'll just take one more.

524
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:11,578
Smile.

525
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,415
One, two, three!

526
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:18,335
So? Are you upset?

527
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:20,712
- Call Geum-myeong right now.
- Why?

528
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,714
You think they went to Busan together?

529
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,883
Why would she go to Busan?

530
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:29,972
You dragged someone else's daughter there,
but you won't let your daughter go?

531
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:31,598
Did I drag you there?

532
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:36,395
I think you'd be on the warpath
if she ever got married.

533
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:38,063
Why would she get married?

534
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,532
I'm letting you know now.

535
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:51,869
I can't go tomorrow.

536
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:55,163
Right.

537
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:57,207
No need to come.

538
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:59,042
You have a class.

539
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:03,255
How can I go all the way to Nonsan?

540
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:05,132
I can't.

541
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:08,468
Go with your mom.

542
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:11,722
It's fine.

543
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:13,974
No need to come.

544
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:17,394
Or go with Oh Ye-rim.

545
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:19,479
Why would I go with her?

546
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:23,817
Anyway, I can't go.

547
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:26,278
I get it.

548
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:29,489
I said I can't go!

549
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:30,407
I said I got it.

550
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:33,702
- Damn it, you don't get it.
- What is it now?

551
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:36,705
What does it mean if I can't go?

552
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:40,626
Tonight

553
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:43,128
is our last night.

554
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:47,132
Our last night before you join the army!

555
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:50,385
<i>Anyway, keep her in check.</i>

556
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:52,554
<i>Your daughter…</i>

557
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:53,889
Do I really have to…

558
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:55,807
What's wrong with you?

559
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,518
<i>…is just like you, Oh Ae-sun.</i>

560
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:03,523
WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU TANGERINES

561
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:07,903
Sweetie.

562
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:17,496
That's nice, isn't it?

563
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:19,498
Yeah.

564
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:23,752
Is it a lot more expensive
to live on higher floors?

565
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:27,172
She said there was no room.

566
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:28,548
You believe her?

567
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:32,719
She can be a little short with us,
but she's still the eldest.

568
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:36,431
And she always worries too much.
Even though I tell her not to.

569
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:39,977
Why do people in Seoul build rooms
in the basement?

570
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:45,107
It would break my heart
to see my baby live in the basement.

571
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:52,990
Do you think anyone would buy
the cabbage field?

572
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:55,575
Leave that one alone.

573
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:57,869
But would they?

574
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:00,372
Stop selling stuff.

575
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,333
Why? You can't let it go?

576
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:07,087
If we sell everything,
there'll be nothing left in your name.

577
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:10,007
Whatever. Your wife over your daughter?

578
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,554
You know, looking back,

579
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:17,764
those days were nice.

580
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:21,018
Was that the summer of our lives?

581
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,771
Everything was so new back then.

582
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:28,108
Everything felt awkward and difficult,

583
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,110
but it was all a first.

584
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:33,155
I loved everything.

585
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:43,999
First love,

586
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,460
our first night…

587
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:49,755
our first home,

588
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:53,216
our first boat, our first full net.

589
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:55,302
Our first child.

590
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:58,221
Having our first child…

591
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,308
No words can describe it.

592
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:06,855
Still, leave the cabbage field.

593
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:20,535
<i>Just leave the cabbage field.</i>

594
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:25,665
<i>That field is your reward</i>
<i>for surviving that summer.</i>

595
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:30,212
<i>I wondered how we could move forward.</i>

596
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:34,633
<i>But life really did go on.</i>

597
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:38,804
<i>Life went on and on.</i>

598
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:42,808
LIFE GOES ON AND ON

599
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:37,816
"IN THE HOPE THAT OUR ECHOS
WILL FLOW AND FLOW UNTIL THEY REACH YOU."

600
