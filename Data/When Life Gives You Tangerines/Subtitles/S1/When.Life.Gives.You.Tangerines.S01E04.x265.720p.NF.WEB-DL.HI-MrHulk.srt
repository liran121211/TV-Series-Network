WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU TANGERINES

3
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,068
[waves crashing]

4
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:14,783
THE BLAZING SUMMER SUNSHINE

5
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,576
[woman] It's so hot today.

6
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,120
Wow, it's scorching hot.

7
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:22,540
Perfect weather to torment
your daughter-in-law.

8
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:27,087
They say 108 prostrations
should be enough.

9
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,588
[button clicks]

10
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,466
It would've worked already
if 108 were enough.

11
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:32,884
She's wasted five years.

12
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:35,136
Even Buddha's sick after 3,000.

13
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:41,184
- Suffering yields dedication.
- [woman] You're just mean. Just mean.

14
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:45,688
How can a lady of the house be so cruel
and expect more children from her?

15
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,233
[Gye-ok] Let's be honest.
Not all children survive.

16
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,443
You could have eight, and two might die.

17
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,612
If the family she married into
valued sons, huh,

18
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,322
she should be having plenty.

19
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,908
How could she try to freeload
off our family?

20
00:01:56,991 --> 00:02:00,453
Her family didn't give us a single
silver spoon as dowry. Nothing at all.

21
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,247
[Mak-cheon] What about you?

22
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,458
Did you bring us a silver spoon?
Is that why you had two?

23
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,797
You can't stand me, but your
granddaughter-in-law is precious, huh?

24
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,342
Let's go now, Ae-sun.

25
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:32,235
[groans] If you make her do
3,000 prostrations,

26
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,696
she'll be too exhausted to do housework.

27
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:36,948
[Gye-ok] Yes, she does so much,
doesn't she?

28
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:39,409
That'll be your pillow talk, huh?

29
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,995
Go ahead, tell your husband
I made you do 3,000.

30
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,455
He could take your side right away,

31
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,458
but no husband likes
when his wife bad-mouths his mother.

32
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:48,418
Huh?

33
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,170
You know, the biggest mama's boys

34
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:54,090
really want their wives to be
the most devoted daughters-in-law.

35
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,384
So watch what you say, huh?

36
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:59,220
[groans] Was that directed to my ears?

37
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,680
Fine, I won't say anything.

38
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:01,848
Sure you wouldn't.

39
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,185
And, plus, he groans in pain each night.

40
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,729
I don't wanna give him
more reasons to be upset.

41
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:10,315
[Gye-ok scoffs] Well, good for you.

42
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,650
They say a man

43
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:16,738
stays with a wife he loves
despite despising her family.

44
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:18,907
For me, it's the opposite.

45
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,408
[Gye-ok] How dare you?

46
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,661
Serves you right. [chuckles]

47
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:27,457
Seems my granddaughter-in-law's
bested my daughter-in-law.

48
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,336
[Gye-ok] Oh, she's so annoying.
Should I teach her a lesson?

49
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:34,923
Hey, why did you just hit
the <i>hareubang's </i>nose?

50
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,633
Huh? Hey.

51
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,427
Why did you just hit his nose? Huh?

52
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,763
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.

53
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,473
Stop right there!

54
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,937
YEOM SUN-NAM, YEOM SUN-BONG

55
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,148
Even the government says
only having one child is patriotic.

56
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,359
They keep saying sons though.

57
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,819
Who cares if we birth sons anyhow?

58
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,864
What was gained by raising Gwan-sik, huh?

59
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,450
They did all that just to give him to me.

60
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,495
Why did she keep throwing red beans at us?

61
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:09,290
Who cares if my mom's spirit
is still here?

62
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:14,087
So what if my mom wants to visit me?
So what?

63
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:15,838
[sighs]

64

[sighs]

66
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,775
I can't even visit my mom's house now.

67
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,780
Well, that's not right.

68
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,534
I do miss her more now that I'm a mom.

69
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,705
I miss my mom even more.

70
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,625
[clattering]

71
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,295
[sniffles]

72
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:39,672
[sighs]

73
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,925
Honestly, must be upsetting

74
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,470
to not be permitted
to visit this house anymore.

75
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,307
[Gye-ok] Mmm.

76
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,142
Mmm.

77
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,437
Mmm.

78
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,230
Ooh! Oh.

79
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:05,198
[Gyeong-ja] You can keep bringing her,
but we're not going to accept her.

80
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,949
We're not taking in new people.

81
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,744
She's so young.
Why do you always drag her here?

82
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:12,789
Veteran <i>haenyeo </i>start their training
between six and seven.

83
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,999
Who begins <i>haenyeo </i>work at the age of six?

84
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,752
Children her age pick kelp
in the shallow waters.

85
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:18,711
That's why.

86
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:22,757
I heard that this spot's for beginners,
so you make her go play in the water now

87
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,176
so she won't be so afraid of it later,
you know?

88
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,886
- She your daughter?
- Mm.

89
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:29,972
Oh, I don't even want to talk to you now.

90
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:30,890
All right?

91
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:34,435
And does Ae-sun know?
Did you ask if it's all right?

92
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,270
Why do I have to get permission?

93
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,563
She can't control me.

94
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,650
Horses and people
must prove their worth to make a living.

95
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,570
We want her to learn a skill.
Why would you be against her having that?

96
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:45,863
Mak-cheon, listen to me.

97
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,741
Every time we go back into the water,

98
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,119
we ask God, "Don't let us die, Lord."

99
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,414
That's why Gwang-rye
told Ae-sun every day,

100
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:57,792
"Don't become a <i>haenyeo</i>.
Please don't bother learning to dive."

101
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,711
If Gwang-rye didn't want
her daughter doing it,

102
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,880
she wouldn't want
her granddaughter to do it.

103
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,299
You responsible for keeping
Geum-myeong alive?

104
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:06,551
Stop nagging and let her dive.

105
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:09,262
You better mind your own business, ladies.
I'm done.

106
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,598
[melodic music playing]

107
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:13,891
[Gye-ok] Oh gosh.

108
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,562
- [Gyeong-ja] Here.
- [Gye-ok] Oh my.

109
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:18,938
[grunts]

110
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,149
[Gye-ok] Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

111
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,568
Let's go. My goodness.

112
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,654
Well, damn it!

113
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,698
I envy people with daughters!

114
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:31,367
Wonder how many they'll have?

115
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:35,037
Who's to blame when you're destined
to live as a housekeeper?

116
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,290
They have two weeks left to pack,

117
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,125
so why are you packing for them?

118
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,169
Don't they have hands?

119
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,381
How will you live now that those brats
won't be around anymore?

120
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,091
[Ae-sun] Hey, they're not brats,

121
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:49,719
and I get angry quick.

122
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,513
- Also, my in-laws…
- Yes, yes.

123
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,309
I know their influence reaches
the Jeju provincial office.

124
00:07:56,392 --> 00:08:00,521
You've told me countless times
that they have sway over lawmakers here.

125
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:04,650
But does their influence extend
all the way to the mainland?

126
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,528
I'm saying I stand with those kids.

127
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:11,949
So don't be mean to Sun-nam and Sun-bong
and give them plenty of food to eat.

128
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,495
What if I'm mean, then?

129
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:20,208
I wanna be tough on them sometimes,
but it's pretty difficult.

130
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,961
How can I when they call me "Mom, Mom"?

131
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:28,090
After raising kids in your house
for ten years, they get to be yours,

132
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:29,634
even if they're not.

133
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:33,471
What matters more than blood is the heart.

134
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,850
[sighs] You still can't figure that out?

135
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:41,687
Gimme.

136
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,029
[baby coos]

137
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:59,539
I'm… sure you have plenty
to be angry about with no one to talk to.

138
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,165
Give me a call.

139
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,209
Maybe you wanna trash-talk

140
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,545
the hag that throws beans at you.

141
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:06,754
I'll listen to you.

142
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:11,092
[scoffs] You know
we're not friends like that, right?

143
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,438
[Min-ok sighs]

144
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,361
Honestly, I wasn't a mistress.

145
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:31,862
I didn't steal him from her.

146
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,991
We got married ten years
after she passed away.

147
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,450
There's no need for enmity.

148
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,036
You and I aren't meant
to be friends though.

149
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,832
Oh, is that why you had to run away
with my yellow dress that night?

150
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,585
[scoffs] I'm just not your friend.

151
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,173
I do respect you.

152
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,931
Now that I've lived in this household,

153
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,017
I respect you.

154
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,311
You're not destined to be a housekeeper.

155
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,021
You just have the heart of one.

156
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:07,523
So then,

157
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:10,109
stick with your man.

158
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,613
You said he's a good guy.

159
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,825
[gentle piano music playing]

160
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,415
Mm, then I…

161
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:27,835
What?

162
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,170
…guess…

163
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,464
Um, I guess…

164
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,592
What?

165
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:37,386
- Spill it.
- I guess I can entrust them to you.

166
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,139
My siblings.

167
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:43,476
- Please let them…
- What?

168
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,102
…finish school.

169
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,979
Stop worrying about my children.

170
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:47,980
Quit it.

171
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,025
Yeah, but still,

172
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,362
I wouldn't just get four popsicles
like you did back then.

173
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:57,031
So if I get corn,
then I do get five, okay?

174
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:03,287
I'm giving you this tricycle instead of

175
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,247
popsicles.

176
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,542
Just think of it as a moral

school grant that I'm donating
to Geum-myeong, okay?

178
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:17,259
Hand out a used tricycle
as a school grant. Really?

179
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,892
After the time you sacrificed for this
family, you're only stealing the tricycle?

180
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,269
What do you mean by "steal" exactly?

181
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,896
You told me to take it.

This time, I counted how many cobs we had.

We have a thief in our own home
when we don't even have enough for us.

189

It's not like she has parents to support,

190
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,682
so why does she give
the little we have left

191

192

You brought tilefish?

You know, honestly, she could've given
the tricycle to her own baby,

217
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,473
but instead,
she just gave it to Geum-myeong.

Let Geum-myeong ride the tricycle.

251
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,458
Geum-myeong has to be
able to ride it. Really.

00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,124
with their limited means.

349
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:37,421
They must be overjoyed
that you and Yeong-beom are dating.

350
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:38,463
Yes. [chuckles]

351
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,925
- They are excited.
- I'm sure they are.

352
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,095
Of course they are.

353
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,016
So you just got a job?

354
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,517
Uh, uh, yes.

355
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:52,853
The management

356
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,356
says a lot of nice things about me.

357
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,942
They say I'll be promoted really quickly.

358
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:00,736
So you'll keep working?

359
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:02,070
Huh?

360
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,614
You want to keep working
after you get married?

361
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:05,532
Uh…

362
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,868
- Yeong-beom and I…
- [silverware clatters]

363
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:11,788
Um, he and I, we talked about it already.

364
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:12,706
Listen,

365
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,792
greed is a result of wanting approval.

366
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,211
That desire turns to conceit.

367
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,714
People who come into wealth quickly

368
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,508
often feel the urge to show their riches.

369
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:28,513
It's funny when women marry into wealth
and start dressing in luxury clothes.

370
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:29,765
[chuckles]

371
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:33,602
What? Have I offended you?

372
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:35,479
[Geum-myeong sighs]

373
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,106
Let me be frank now.

374
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,026
Would you rather be promoted to manager

375
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:43,362
or be the next
vice minister's daughter-in-law?

376
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:47,366
Yeong-beom is our eldest son,
and he's very capable.

377
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,159
So then why would his wife

378
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:52,662
need a life outside the home
instead of supporting him?

379
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,790
It frustrates you

380
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:56,625
that I am old-fashioned?

381
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,212
The thing is…

382
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:04,174
I never want Geum-myeong
to feel inferior to anybody, anywhere.

383
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:11,306
I'm as capable as Yeong-beom is, and I…

384
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,976
I'm also my family's eldest child.

385
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,979
I want to take care of my family
with my own money.

386
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:19,689
And…

387
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:21,691
[sighs]

388
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,318
…I have a strong drive,

389
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:26,738
so just getting hired isn't enough.

390
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:31,118
I want to be the manager, supervisor,
and even president. I want it all.

391
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:36,206
That can't be a shameful ambition,
uh, isn't that true?

392
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,501
You're right.

393
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,964
I would think
that pretty girls would be more ladylike.

394
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,299
They say indoor plants

395
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,385
are a bit easier to manage.

396
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,306
[Geum-myeong sighs]

397
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,059
So what you mean is…

398
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:00,063
is you're not an indoor plant either?

399
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,610
- [silverware clatters]
- [sighs]

400
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,366
What can I do?

401
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,287
Apparently, I'm the not-pretty,
hard-to-handle eldest daughter.

402
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:18,748
I've had enough, okay?

403
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,500
I'm totally fine living without you,

404
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,752
and I'm not desperate
to get married either.

405
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,134
[sighs, moans]

406
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:32,762
[sighs]

407
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:43,648
[middle-aged Ae-sun] Good grief.

408
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:48,195
You have more shoes
than I've ever worn in my life.

409
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:51,114
Goodness, you make money to use like this?

410
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:55,285
I didn't ask you to clean them.
It's so cold, and that's all you wanna do?

411
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:56,870
They're all cheap shoes.

412
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:58,872
They aren't worth your money.

413
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:00,290
Goodness gracious.

414
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:07,005
Why did you buy so many shoes, huh?

415
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,842
This is all vanity

416
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:13,470
and a… waste of money.

417
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:18,642
Someone told me greed is conceit.

418
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:20,227
What's that?

419
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,229
Maybe because I grew up poor,

420
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:24,981
I want to keep buying more.

421
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,906
Maybe it's from deep pain.

422
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,826
[sighs] You made me beg,

423
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:41,665
sometimes for three days, if I wanted
new clothes for field trips, you know.

424
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:44,292
I wanted things, but we didn't have money.

425
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,921
I grew up wanting stuff so bad,
and we couldn't ever get it.

426
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:50,966
Now I never stop myself.

427
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:54,177
It's very much cheap stuff.

428
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,304
They're all impulse buys.

429
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,516
[window rattles]

430
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:00,767
[sighs]

431
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,645
It's not like I got what I liked

432
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:06,648
refusing to buy you what you wanted.

433
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:08,149
I still provided

434
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:11,903
the best food and clothing
I could give you with what we had.

435
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:15,073
What are you justifying right now?
You had me beg for things.

436
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:24,874
Did something ha… happen today

437
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,543
at the office?

438
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,169
Damn it!

439
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:30,380
Anyone giving you trouble?

440
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:32,340
You wouldn't understand, would you?

441
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:35,510
If you feel burned out,
then take time off.

442
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,178
A break would be good.

443
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:40,390
You work in an office building
and try to get a break.

444
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:43,393
If it's so hard,
then quit and get married…

445
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:44,311
And what?

446
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:45,895
You want me to live like you?

447
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:49,566
Get hitched into another poor family,
scraping by, spending my life…

448
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,986

that my life was worth living.

There is no better job in Jeju
than being a <i>haenyeo</i>.

If we have one in the family,
she will then be our foundation.

She won't need to ask us for a thing.
She'll make her own money,

she'll support the family.

She won't become a judge or an attorney.

My mother developed a condition
because of her diving that killed her.

499
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:32,562
Till the day she died,
she said, "Don't be a <i>haenyeo</i>."

- How dare you!

- Oh, Geum-myeong.
- A housekeeper, huh?

503
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,990
You call serving your in-laws
and our ancestors housekeeping?

504
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:48,828
You think I will let her
live like me as a housekeeper?

- You will be grateful for your life here.

00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:26,783
Her mother's soul is in her.

520
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:29,118
Her spirit has possessed that girl.

521
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:32,497
- And that's why she's lost her mind.
- [Gye-ok] You're right!

522
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:36,167
That's what's happening.
Of course she acts just like her mother.

523
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:40,755
You grew up in a worthless household,
raised by a lowly woman.

524
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,423
This is an honorable household.

525
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,133
[Mak-cheon] Please watch over us.

526
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,885
- Please watch…
- Hey, Gwan-sik.

527
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:48,388
Did you see how she's been behaving?

528
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:50,473
Did you see her demeanor?

529
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:52,976
She says Geum-myeong isn't my grandchild

530
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:56,896
and disrespected the ancestors and glared
and kept screaming at me and just…

531
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,649
Say no more. Kick her out!

532
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:03,194
The ancestors will not tolerate her!

533
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,280
Grandma, have you been
throwing beans at her?

534
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:09,534
Kick her out of here!
Kick her out! Kick her out! Kick her out!

535
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,579
I hadn't hit her ever before.

536
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:14,998
[Mak-cheon] Oh dear.
This is just too much.

537
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:16,583
I can't breathe now.

538
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,085
- Oh no.
- Oh!

539
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:21,838
Oh no. Oh no. Mom!
Ae-sun, you're giving her a heart attack.

540
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:23,298
Oh my. Oh my.

541
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,091
[Gwan-sik] Mom. Grandma.

542
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:28,344
I'm the reason Ae-sun came here.
Not to be your daughter-in-law.

543
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,055
- What?
- [Gwan-sik] You won't see…

544
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,516
You won't see Ae-sun anymore.

545
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,769
I won't let her live here.

546
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,443
[Mak-cheon scoffs] How dare she!

547
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:45,236
Kick her out!

548
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,863
Kick her out!

549
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,865
Oh my!

550
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,455
Why don't you wear them?

551
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,124
They suit you better, I think.

552
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,629
They fit really well, yes.

553
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:04,213
[chuckles]

554
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:08,301
Jeez, um,
you should've married a rich guy.

555
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:11,387
Then you could be all dressed up
in floral patterns all the time.

556
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:14,182
You do have some regrets, right?

557
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:20,730
If you told me to, uh,
go back and marry your dad again, I'd say…

558
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:21,856
Of course, you wouldn't.

559
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:24,692
Yeah.

560
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:27,820
I'd do it.

561
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,447
[sentimental music playing]

562
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,074
- [middle-aged Gwan-sik] Geum-myeong.
- Oh.

563
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:33,076
What's this?

564
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:34,160
Hey there.

565
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:37,205
[middle-aged Ae-sun] Oh, I told you
not to buy two bags.

566
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,498
Didn't I say that?

567
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:41,334
She can buy her own peas, you know?

568
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:42,418
What did you pay?

569
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:45,463
- You get scammed again?
- Look, I brought a whistle.

570
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:47,131
- [whistle blows]
- Oh, it's so loud!

571
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,342
- World's scary. [laughs]
- Look, babe. My shoes.

572
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,386
- Aren't they cute?
- Oh, they look good.

573
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:52,303
[laughs]

574
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,763
- Yeah.
- They fit great.

575
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:54,681
They look perfect.

576
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:58,226
DODONG-RI VARIETY SHOP

577
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,812
ONE ROOM, ONE KITCHEN
MONTHLY RENT, NO DEPOSIT NEEDED

578
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,775
[soothing pop music playing]

579
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:24,127
GA, NA, DA, RA…

580
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:32,093
- [Ae-sun] Geum-myeong, you want some peas?
- [young Geum-myeong] I want some peas.

581
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:36,347
[Ae-sun giggles]
One more time. Here are some peas.

582
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:39,183
- [young Geum-myeong] Here are some peas.
- Good. Eat some more.

583
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:42,020
One more time. You want some peas?

584
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,063
- [young Geum-myeong] I want some peas.
- Yes!

585
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,523
My darling.

586
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:49,068
- [young Geum-myeong] Squid. Squid.
- [Ae-sun] Squid? You want some squid?

587
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:50,778
[both] Squid.

588
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,613
[blowing]

589
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:56,743
Squid, squid. Oh.

590
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:59,370
- That's a good girl.
- Is it good? Is it good? [chuckles]

591
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,330
[man clears throat]

592
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:03,207
[whispers] Landlord. Landlord.

593
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:15,136
Hey, not those. Auntie gave them to us.

594
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:18,389
Won't he ask why we've got
abalone to eat when we can't pay rent?

595
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:23,311
[landlord clears throat]

596
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:24,353
Yes, sir!

597
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,565
Oh. [chuckles]

598
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:29,942
Sir, I, uh,

599
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:32,653
I am looking for
a new fishing job right now.

600
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:38,117
Could we pay rent
at the very end of the month?

601
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,244
Just pay me in the fall if that's better!

602
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:43,706
No, that's not it. I'm not implying
we're trying to scam you, okay?

603
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,166
Sir, hello.

604
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,502
I'll watch the store
more often if you like.

605
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:50,713
Someone came during the day
and handed me your rent for three months.

606
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,256
And you… you weren't aware of that?

607
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:55,093
Huh? Who did?

608
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:57,678
Someone handed you three months of rent?

609
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,807
Is there anyone named Do in your family?

610
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,393
Do you have a relative named Do?

611
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,395
Someone from the Do family paid for it.

612
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,856
So if you pay the rent on time,

613
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:11,234
I'll give you pork.

614
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,027
[landlord clears throat]

615
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:20,243
DO HUI-JEONG SCHOLARSHIP
AMOUNT: 10,000 WON

616
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:22,328
[pensive music playing]

617
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:28,292
[breathes deeply]

618
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,255
Stop glaring at me.

619
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:33,965
Who is she?

620
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,467
Who's Hui-jeong?

621
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,929
What? I've been side by side
with you since you were ten.

622
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:41,472
Really? Hui-jeong?

623
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,977
Mm, yeah. Nobody ever had a thing for you.

624
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,188
- Tell me how you're so sure.
- [scoffs]

625
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:51,774
I've never known anyone
from the Do family.

626
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:55,278
What about your grandma?

627
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,322
My grandmother's name is Kim Chun-ok.

628
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,241
My aunt's name is Hyeon Yi-suk.

629
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:03,244
Most importantly,
my grandmother is really poor.

630
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,706
My grandma is Park Mak-cheon.

631
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:08,249
My mom is Kwon Gye-ok.

632
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,002
It could be Mom.

633
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:15,381
Maybe my mom went into
the body of a rich housewife,

634
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:18,342
and she had her dip into her account
at the bank and then…

635
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:20,928
[jaunty music playing]

636
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:29,854
[clears throat]

637
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:31,606
[sighs]

638
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,780
[groans]

639
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,617
[jaunty music continues]

640
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:45,828
[sighs]

641
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:50,291
[landlord grunts] Oh, come on.

642
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,584
Oh, come on!

643
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:56,631
Why are they so inconsiderate?
How dare they!

644
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:59,091
[Gye-ok] <i>Your landlady said</i>

645
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:01,510
<i>you guys get busy</i>
<i>as soon as it's 9:00 p.m.</i>

646
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:06,641
At your age, yeah, I guess
you would be diligent in that, huh?

647
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:09,727
If you're so diligent about
turning off the lights at night,

648
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:12,355
of course
the goddess of fertility would bless you.

649
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:15,816
[woman 6 laughs] Look how happy she is
since leaving the in-laws.

650
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,070
Hmm? Living without stress
helps with pregnancy too.

651
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:22,281
[Gye-ok] If her in-laws tormented her
all day, and he walked into their room,

652
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:26,202
she wouldn't want to make love
to her mother-in-law's son.

653
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:28,454
[woman 6] Oh, of course
she wouldn't want to

654
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,165
make love to him then.

655
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:35,294
[woman 5 laughing] They're diligent, sure,
but the one I'm most proud of is…

656
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:36,379
[chuckles]

657
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:39,382
…Geum-myeong.
Oh, yes. What a gift you are.

658
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,509
Living in that tiny room.

659
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,302
[woman 6] My goodness gracious.

660
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:46,430
As long as they want them,

661
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:49,308
then a one-bedroom house
can support six kids, I think.

662
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,852
- [sighs, chuckles]
- [woman 6] Oh my. Oh my.

663
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,355
She's turning into Gwang-rye already.

664
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:58,067
This bookworm of a girl
is now a middle-aged woman. Jeez.

665
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:01,320
If you lived closer, we'd see you
as much as we used to see Gwang-rye.

666
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:04,615
You came all the way back here
just because your rent is a lot less?

667
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:05,700
[Gye-ok] Leave her alone.

668
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:08,911
If she lived here, her mother-in-law
would be over here all the time.

669
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:11,956
[woman 6] It's easier to make money
if you know folks.

670
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:14,625
Newbies aren't liked by islanders.

671
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:19,213
Hey, how's Gwan-sik's fishing job?

672
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,466
[Ae-sun] Well, he's hard-working,
as you know.

673
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:26,512
He hasn't told you
what it is he does, has he?

674
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:30,224
- You, you, you, you, watch your mouth.
- [Geong-ja] She needs to know though.

675
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,643
Why? What is it?

676
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:37,023
Gwan-sik hasn't said for whom he works?

677
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:41,610
Hey, is your hand okay?

678
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:46,073
- [Gyeong-ja] Oh!
- Oh no!

679
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:52,413
What's this?

680
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,666
- What happened to your hand?
- It's fine.

681
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,543
[sobs]

682
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:59,670
[man] You should've come
as soon as you got hurt.

683
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:02,590
If you wait too long,
your fingers won't heal right.

684
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:07,219
Big dummy. You said nothing.

685
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:10,222
If you were hurt, you should've asked them
to turn back to shore.

686
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:14,060
What's so glorious about fishing that
you'd pull the net and break your fingers?

687
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:15,603
[Ae-sun sighs]

688
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,438
[Ae-sun groans]

689
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,357
Cat got your tongue or what?

[woman 6] <i>Life itself isn't evil,</i>

691
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:25,988
but money is.

692
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:30,242
Unfortunately, that family has control
over the seas on this side of the island.

693
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,828
You can't get fishing work in Dodong-ri

694
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:35,289
and not work for that guy.

695
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,208
That's why he works for that guy.

696
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:38,834
[woman 6] You don't know.

697
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:42,546
He's young, but he's trying to be
the head of his household.

Hey, babe.

00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:31,720
Honey!

705
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:36,517
Hey, can you not hear me?

706
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,352
Hey, help me get this inside.

707
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:41,689
Oh man.

00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:42,731
[music fades]

709
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:44,400
Asleep without dinner again.

[breathing heavily]

711
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,952
Here you go. Right there.

712
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:58,622
Dad's a baby. He sleeps all day like one.

713
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,208
Sweetie.

714
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:04,253
Oh my.

715
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,046
It's hot.

716
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:09,049
You should change, right?

717
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,051
[Gwan-sik moans]

718
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:13,929
Oh.

719
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,057
You keep wearing long sleeves.

Do you need to be on that squid boat?

731
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:40,516
You know, a man needs his rest.

732
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:43,018
Dad, bring us a hundred squids, okay?

733
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:45,813
Dad doesn't need to bring any squids back.

734
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:48,774
I will

735
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:50,901
bring so many squids for you.

00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,510
Catch a lot of fish!

740
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:19,221
Catch so many squids for me!

741
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,688
[chuckles]

742
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:33,569
- [Ae-sun] Go.
- Go.

[gentle piano music continues]

745
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:01,847
[young Geum-myeong] It looks yummy.

[landlord groans]

00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,736
You only get up to four for free.

749
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:23,077
I think I'll get another can of sugar.

- [boy 1] How dare you!
- [boy 2] How dare you!

751
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:27,539
[boy 1] Die!

752
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:29,708
- [boy 2] Why would I die?
- [boy 1] How dare you!

753
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:32,044
- [boy 2] Ah!
- How dare you! How dare you!

754
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:34,129
You dare challenge your older brother?

755
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,882
How dare you! How dare you!

756
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:38,884
- You really want to fight me?
- [boy 2] Ah-ha!

757
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:42,513
I… I didn't get to bring you kimchi

758
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:44,515
or visit when you were moving,

759
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,892
so I wanted to say hi today.

760
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:52,481
How are his fingers doing?
Are they healing all right, Ae-sun?

761
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,985
He's… [chuckles] …getting acupuncture.

762
00:44:57,569 --> 00:44:58,404
Ah.

763
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:00,322
I nagged at my husband a little.

764
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:03,283
If a man was hurt,
he should've turned the boat around.

765
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,536
As if squids
are more important than people.

766
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:09,540
Mr. Kim and Mr. Park
asked him to turn the boat around.

767
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:11,709
They happened to have full nets that day.

768
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:15,129
I understand why
my husband got a bit greedy.

769
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:17,631
- [tender piano music playing]
- [sighs]

770
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:20,592
Mr. Yang is something else though,
isn't he?

771
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:23,554
How did he stay on that boat
overnight with those fingers?

772
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:27,641
If it were me, I would've been
rolling on the floor in pain.

773
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:32,187
So the captain
didn't turn the boat around?

774
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:34,273
Sorry?

775
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:36,650
He didn't turn the boat around?

776
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:38,026
Oh…

777
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:42,614
My husband can't open his hand fully now.

778
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:48,203
He moans in pain each night too.

779
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,372
You don't need to worry about that.

780
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:54,042
I did ask again and again
for my husband to quit hitting Mr. Yang,

781
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:57,171
so he, uh, he says he's really stopped
beating him up.

782
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:01,300
I don't know why
he's particularly mean to Mr. Yang.

783
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:08,557
My husband does have a temper,
but he's not a bad guy, you know.

784
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,558
[boy 1] How dare you!

785
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:11,685
[boys grunting]

786
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:14,188
[boy 1] You wanna mess with me?
I'll knock some sense into you!

787
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,606
[boy 2] How dare you!

788
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:18,650
How dare you! How dare you! Damn it!

789
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:19,860
How dare you!

790
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:20,986
How dare you!

791
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:22,404
How dare you!

792
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,157
[man 1] How dare you!

793
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,243
You wanna mess with me, huh?

794
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,871
You always leave so early.

795
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:32,998
You're a big deal?

796
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:35,375
That man can't ever wait to go home.

797
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:40,005
You always bring packed lunches.
What's packed in that bag, huh?

798
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,049
Goodbye.

799
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:43,342
Hey, asshole!

800
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:51,892
- You're driving the boat.
- [man 2] Oh, come on, Captain.

801
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:55,979
Do you have a crush on Gwan-sik?
Why hold back a man who wants to go home?

802
00:46:56,063 --> 00:47:00,359
I'm gonna drink a box of booze,
so just stand by and drive this damn boat.

803
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:03,070
But, uh, Captain, he lives so close by.

804
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:04,571
Hey, man, listen!

805
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:09,368
If the captain doesn't get off the boat,
then no one gets off the boat either.

806
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:12,621
Supporting the captain is also
an element of working here, okay?

807
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:13,622
Get it?

808
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:15,415
Know what I'm saying?

809
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:19,878
Okay, let's get to work.

810
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:22,047
Let's get to work.

811
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:23,465
Now.

812
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:24,925
[liquid pouring]

813
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:28,136
Don't feel like it?

814
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:31,974
Wanna mess with me?

815
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:34,059
Tell me if you're not pleased
about what I said.

816
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:36,520
Please speak up
and buy your own boat, kid.

817
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:41,191
Oh, really? So what was it you said again?

818
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:42,150
"Shut up, man"?

819
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:45,654
[breathes deeply]

820
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:53,954
Ms. Park, don't justify
everything he does.

821
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:57,416
Yes, life is tough.

822
00:47:58,542 --> 00:47:59,543
Still, I think

823
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:02,170
what isn't right isn't right.

824
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:05,841
[captain] Look, if you don't want to,
just say so.

825
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:08,010
You a mute or what, Gwan-sik?

826
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:11,638
Oh. Because you don't have a boat, right?

827
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:14,057
All right. All right, all right, I see.

828
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:21,773
No, I don't want to.

829
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:23,191
What?

830
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:25,235
I can't lie about wanting to.

831
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:27,321
[pensive music playing]

832
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:29,573
Hey!

833
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:33,785
[woman] Excuse me.

834
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:37,789
Oh.

835
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,044
[woman sighs]

836
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,758
[door opens and closes]

837
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:51,178
Just can't wait to get home, huh?

838
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:52,387
[music fades]

839
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:55,933
Why are you taking my squids?

840
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:59,728
You can't be taking these
except if I let you. Get that?

841
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:02,022
What boat do you own?

842
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:05,359
You can have these if I let you.
You can stay back if I say so.

843
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:09,154
Why are you always leaving early? Why?
What, do you like your wife that much?

844
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:13,075
What's there to like? What?
Say something. Why don't you tell me?

845
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:15,243
Are you crazy for her?

846
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:17,871
You passionate every night, huh?

847
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,582
Are you just dying to see her, are you?

848
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:22,209
Yes.

849
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:24,086
I'm dying to see her.

850
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:26,713
What?

851
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:29,007
[chuckles, scoffs]

852
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:32,052
You bunch of losers.
Gosh, you are such a punk.

853
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:35,055
Seriously, man. Really?
What? You don't know?

854
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,724
How dare you! How dare you, kid!

855
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:40,185
And why don't you ever
wanna go home, Captain?

856
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:42,312
- What'd you say?
- What?

857
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:44,606
Do you feel lonely there?

858
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,567
Because she doesn't treat you
the way you like?

859
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,446
[chuckles] Oh jeez.

860
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:54,783
[laughing]

861
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:58,036
Oh shit.

862
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:02,207
[breathing heavily]

863
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:03,583
That asshole.

864
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:13,010
[captain] You punks need me
to beat some sense into you?

865
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:14,636
Do you?

866
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:19,975
You asshole!

867
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:23,895
- Asshole!
- [upbeat jaunty music playing]

868
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:25,772
[young Ae-sun] Asshole!

869
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,566
[Ae-sun screaming]

870
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:40,537
Hey, you asshole!

871
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:44,332
You asshole!

872
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:48,211
[Geum-myeong] <i>Dad always said</i>
<i>Mom wasn't really like a rose</i>

873
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:50,589
<i>but more like a whistle.</i>

874
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:52,924
[Ae-sun panting]

875
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:55,969
[music fades]

876
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:58,055
[panting]

877
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:04,519
Gwan-sik won't work… for you

878
00:51:05,353 --> 00:51:06,188
ever again.

879
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:09,107
He's done working for you!

880
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:15,947
'Kay, don't do it.
Go away, man, just go home.

881
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:18,075
My brother's the chief
of the fishing village.

882
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:20,869
Don't think about getting
on a boat in Dodong-ri again!

883
00:51:21,703 --> 00:51:23,955
Boy, I dodged a bullet on that one.
Asshole!

884
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:25,540
That girl, how dare she!

885
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:27,292
The little brat! Reckless.

886
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:30,420
The husband and the wife are equally bad.

887
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:33,006
[spits]

888
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:38,637
- Take this!
- [captain grunts]

889
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:42,140
- [captain groans]
- You need me to beat some sense into you?

890
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:44,434
Why you little…

891
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:45,644
How dare you!

892
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:46,561
Huh?

893
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:49,856
You should come to your senses first,
and then we'll see…

894
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:50,941
we'll see…

895
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:53,443
we'll see who really dodged a bullet here…

896
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:54,569
How dare you!

897
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:58,073
[captain] You wench!

898
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:01,034
[whimpers] Ouch!

899
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:05,622
Sang-gil's nickname needs a change.

900
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:07,082
Dodong-ri's asshole.

901
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:10,001
Yeah, "Asshole!"

902
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:12,087
- [laughs]
- [Sang-gil groans]

903
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:15,173
Oh man. Oh, that hurts so much.

904
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:17,259
[gentle piano music playing]

905
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:21,346
[sniffles]

906
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:23,181
A whistle. A whistle.

907
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:25,267
You're a human whistle.

908
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:28,687
[crying]

909
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:31,565
You kicked him. Why are you crying?

910
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:34,151
[crying continues]

911
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:56,006
[middle-aged Ae-sun] We don't need
a water heater. It doesn't use coal.

912
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:58,842
What about the draft?

913
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:02,262
You said if you could do it,

914
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:05,473
you'd do it all over,
and you'd marry me again.

915
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:08,602
[Geum-myeong] <i>Mom always said…</i>

916
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:12,272
- Would you?
- Why would I?

917
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:13,899
I'm fed up with you.

918
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:18,361
[Geum-myeong] …<i>out of all of us,</i>
<i>Dad's the one who pains her the most.</i>

919
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:20,447
[middle-aged Ae-sun]
Steel wears out too, doesn't it?

920
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,407
Why is your body already breaking down?

921
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:24,034
Stop scaring me, okay?

922
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:26,703
[middle-aged Gwan-sik] Oh my.

923
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:33,793
You've been lifting big loads
since you were ten.

924
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:35,754
Of course you're having issues.

925
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:39,341
Don't worry, Ae-sun.
I'm going to outlive you anyway.

926
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:43,178
What? When I die,
would you want another wife?

927
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:50,227
[tender pop music playing]

928
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:53,021
Would you like a new wife?

929
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:55,523
I couldn't treat you like that.

930
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,568
I don't want someone to replace you.

931
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:01,196
I'd feel better sending you off first

932
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:03,448
and then following after.

933
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:11,248
[tender pop music continues]

934
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:59,791
"THE SAME SKY, THE SAME STARS,
ETCHED IN THE SAME HEARTS."
