1
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,982
WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU TANGERINES

2
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,193
Careful.

3
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,278
One, two.

4
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,072
Be careful.

5
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,365
<i>Even if a million miles lie ahead of you…</i>

6
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,495
Please, mister!

7
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:21,456
That's really upsetting me! Be gentle!

8
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:25,460
<i>…your greatest worry</i>
<i>is the one in front of you.</i>

9
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:28,630
- Can you lift this?
- One, two.

10
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,050
Look, do we really have to take this up?

11
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,969
Even if we do, there's nowhere to put it.

12
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,597
You wanna sleep with this huge thing
in that tiny place?

13
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,975
This is my wedding furniture.

14
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,144
My very first.

15
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:46,523
If you're downsizing,
you should take less stuff.

16
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:50,360
Who cares about a mother-of-pearl wardrobe
these days? All wrapped up…

17
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,986
It's Tongyeong mother-of-pearl.

18
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:54,405
All right, let's take it up.

19
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,324
- Let's take it up!
- Take it up.

20
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:57,283
Okay!

21
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:58,409
- One more person.
- Okay.

22
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,744
Let's tilt it.

23
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:02,789
Seriously!

24
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,792
So why did we have to move?

25
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,753
- Is that brat your only child?
- "Brat"?

26
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:11,756
Cheol-yong's sister is a bus conductor.
She gives him pocket money.

27
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,882
Is that brat…

28
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:16,803
Is she the pillar of our home?
She's why it's falling apart.

29
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,513
- Damn it.
- "Damn it"?

30
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,016
Why are you always so tough on me?

31
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,144
You'd better fix your hair.

32
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:27,147
Do you go to school to make people laugh?

33
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:31,025
- Pull it.
- Get ready to pull. Lift it!

34
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:32,610
Here we go.

35
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:49,711
What's wrong with this?

36
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,591
Oh no.

37
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:02,265
What's that?
Is it going to be a shoe cabinet now?

38
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,856
Where are your aunties?

39
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:14,569
They butted in at my circumcision,
so where are they now?

40
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:17,238
They are busy because of the Olympics.

41
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:22,493
I really don't get it.
Why are they involved in the Olympics?

42
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,371
They say <i>haenyeo </i>represent Jeju.

43
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:30,001
When they were given those roles,
they quickly made up with the government.

44
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,795
What else is there for them to do
but make up?

45
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,593
Where are you going?
You have a test coming up.

46
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:44,349
You want me to waste money on college too?
Are you gonna move to a hut next?

47
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:49,354
What about that darn wardrobe?
You said it was your wedding furniture!

48
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,815
What? Am I starving you or something?

49
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,026
Why do you always go on about money?

50
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,070
Stop wasting electricity!

51
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:58,863
Off to Cheol-yong's again?

52
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:48,621
Come here.

53
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,263
This is a little better.

54
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:06,764
A little.

55
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,935
I'll wallpaper the living room, too,
in one of those floral prints you love.

56
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,104
It's already peeling.

57
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,358
You picked the perfect spot
for the wardrobe.

58
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,652
You can hang clothes
as soon as you come home,

59
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:20,862
so the flow's perfect.

60
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,282
You're the smart one,
so you pick everything perfectly.

61
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,201
Why are you so talkative all of a sudden?

62
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,496
Shall we go with floral curtains?

63
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,624
Let's do it. Call the home decor store.

64
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,586
- Call--
- It's fine.

65
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,715
I like this place.

66
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,222
It's just the wardrobe.

67
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:51,059
It holds a special place in my heart.

68
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,478
That's why I got annoyed.

69
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,066
Now you're laughing?

70
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,194
Have you ever lived in an apartment?

71
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,197
How will you handle
being cramped up in here?

72
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,617
Where will you hang blankets
or store big sauce jars?

73
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,203
I've never been picky
about where we lived.

74
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:14,332
Whether it was at your parents' house
or a one-bedroom rental,

75
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,668
wherever you were was home to me.

76
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,340
You should've married a rich man.

77
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:25,426
Oh Ae-sun loves books
and enjoys being coy.

78
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,554
You were born to be a rich man's wife.

79
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:33,893
All the wives in Dodong-ri
are jealous of me.

80
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:36,437
Who else gets to live
in a flower field like this?

81
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:39,941
Really.

82
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:44,487
This wallpaper is so outdated.
Where did you even get it?

83
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,698
<i>Even if a million miles lie ahead of you…</i>

84
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,909
Go. You'll get paste on you.

85
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,912
<i>…your greatest joy</i>

86
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,498
<i>is the one in front of you.</i>

87
00:06:56,958 --> 00:07:00,920
You gave your kid everything,
so now you're back to a street stall.

88
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:06,259
You're just as stubborn as Gwang-rye.

89
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:08,553
"Sun and the Three Aunties'" was fine.

90
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,012
AUNTIES' SEAFOOD HOUSE

91
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,224
I didn't even pay anything,
so why put my name on it?

92
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:15,726
I don't like that. I really don't!

93
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:19,480
After all these years,
does a sense of shame feed you?

94
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:23,317
For so long, you've been clinging
to something that doesn't even make money.

95
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,988
Charge me for setting up a stall here.

96
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,365
Why wouldn't you charge me?

97
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,702
I want to make it clear
I'm only selling appetizers<i>.</i>

98
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,745
I will never sell what you sell!

99
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,376
Why are you like this again? Why?

100
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,962
How do you have time to play with a ball?

101
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:43,880
Whatever!

102
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:47,383
And that hair!
Where did you get the money to do that?

103
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,301
Whatever!

104
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,511
You're selling stuff again, aren't you?

105
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:55,808
For heaven's sake,
you're driving me up the wall!

106
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,269
- Whatever!
- She's soaking wet.

107
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:00,938
Turn off the faucet. Hurry.

108
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,940
Ae-sun's clock is smashed.

109
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,984
You'll hurt yourself. Move your hand.

110
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,910
He didn't even eat. Where did he go?

111
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:17,079
Good grief, he's always going
to Cheol-yong's.

112
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:23,377
Young children are so easy to treat, huh?

113
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:28,049
No matter what you do, they still
look for you and call out, "Mom."

114
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,094
Don't walk all over them
'cause they're easy to treat.

115
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:36,098
A young leaf can be torn
by even a gentle rain.

116
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:44,273
Auntie, when will I be fully grown?

117
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,443
I'm not yet either.

118
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:51,906
<i>None of us have fully grown up…</i>

119
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,450
You even bought a big one. Why?

120
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,913
Are you bribing us
to take good care of your wife?

121
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:00,540
Yes.

122
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,667
His people skills are improving.

123
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:09,090
<i>…but every time our hearts</i>
<i>felt growing pains,</i>

124
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,426
<i>we all grew a little.</i>

125
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:16,722
<i>What's going on?</i>

126
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,724
Hey, finish that later and come out here.

127
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,017
Come out!

128
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,435
Where do we stand?

129
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,645
- Auntie!
- There you are.

130
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,188
- To the middle.
- To the middle.

131
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,189
Hey, come here.

132
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,233
All right. Are we good?

133
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,985
- Wait.
- What?

134
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,778
- Come on.
- Leave my hair alone.

135
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,531
One, two, say kimchi!

136
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:06,314
<i>Didn't I tell you to stop setting up</i>
<i>that stall on the street?</i>

137
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:10,318
<i>I told you I hate</i>
<i>that you eat out on the street every day!</i>

138
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,070
What did she write here?

139
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,364
COME AND CHECK US OUT!

140
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:20,369
FRESH FISH DAILY, STRAIGHT FROM THE BOAT
MARKET PRICES ALL DAY

141
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,461
<i>There are moments when the heart grows.</i>

142
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:33,215
<i>Seeing them on the street again</i>
<i>because of me, I made a vow to myself…</i>

143
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:44,894
{\an8}<i>never to take their dreams away again.</i>

SONG YEONG-SAM
SAN-108, BONGCHEON 5-DONG

145
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:58,074
Boarding houses near the school
can be quite expensive.

146
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:02,703
Though it's hilly here,
it's good for your health.

147
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,830
INTEREST RATE SOARS
JAPAN'S ECONOMY UNSTABLE

148
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:08,626
But if you could just fix the room door…

149
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,844
He's just a kid. What's the big deal
if a kid comes and goes?

150
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:23,641
Still, if you could just install
a latch inside…

151
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:29,397
What, don't you trust us?
You're a funny one, aren't you?

152
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:33,401
The one who lived here before you
never said a word.

153
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:36,445
He called him over and looked after him,
saying how cute he was.

154
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,114
Come on, take a look.

155
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,616
Look how adorable he is.

156
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:42,535
Right.

157
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,248
He is cute.

158
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,876
You know it's harder to find a room
or boarding house

159
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,045
than an apartment these days.

160
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:58,342
We have the luxury to choose our tenants,
but you don't have much choice.

161

{\an8}YEONG-SIM
YEONG-SIM'S DREAM

162
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:04,932
{\an8}<i>Perhaps Yeong-sim had many dreams</i>
<i>because her family owned a home in Seoul.</i>

163
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:07,893
Let's all just be easygoing.

164
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:11,772
Sure, easygoing.

165
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:14,984
- It's me who needs to be easygoing.
- That reminds me.

166
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,446
I'm saying this
because you remind me of my daughter.

167
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:21,449
No boyfriends allowed.
If you bring one, I'll kick you out.

168
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,159
No Park Chung-seop.

169
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,411
If you were my daughter,
I'd break your legs.

170
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,455
If I'm like your daughter, a door latch--

171
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:33,419
DO NOT ENTER! KNOCK!

172
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:46,307
Quiet. If they catch you, we're dead.

173
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:53,981
Hello?

174
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,275
Your son Cheol-yong

175
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:57,943
is here.

176
00:12:58,861 --> 00:12:59,695
Yes.

177
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:04,909
It's time for <i>MacGyver </i>to be on now,
but my son is still in his room.

178
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,036
Yeah.

179
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,162
Exactly.

180
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,791
Cheol-yong really is something.

181
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:16,462
If he was so afraid of his dad yelling,
he shouldn't have come last in his class.

182
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:20,508
Not only did he come in last,
but now he's run away from home!

183
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,118
Why lock the door?

184
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,079
Privacy.

185
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,498
What was that?

186
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,834
Come on, get out of my room!

187
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,587
This isn't your room.

188
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,964
Did you buy this place?

189
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,382
Whatever!

190
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:05,261
Is that all you'll ever say to me?
"Whatever"?

191
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:07,680
Get out!

192
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,099
- You just don't get it.
- What did you say?

193
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,067
Then what do we do?

194
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,446
If you keep your mouth shut,
what should I do?

195
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,451
So let's just call it quits now.

196
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,161
You'd shave if you cared--

197
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,663
It's not that I don't love you.

198
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:35,082
Show me how I can stop loving you!

199
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,876
So now what?

200
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,169
Can you quit
and get your teaching certificate?

201
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,546
I have my own level too.

202
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,923
I have to marry
better than Suk-gyeong did.

203
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,551
Are your worthless paintings
more important than I am?

204
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:48,178
Should I stick egg cartons on the wall?

205
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:51,265
Can you beat my father? At least shave!

206
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:53,559
Do I mean less than your facial hair?

207
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,563
Dad, give me the biggest one, okay?

208
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,148
Give my sister the smallest one!

209
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,566
Okay.

210
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,033
The key is not there.

211
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,577
Bu-seon, are you here?

212
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,288
- Bu-seon!
- Bu-seon!

213
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,458
Song Bu-seon!

214
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,510
He's going through puberty!

215
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,137
What's so special about it?

216
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,350
Remember when you'd steal those croakers,
mackerels, and tilefish for me?

217
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,521
Your mom said she wished she dropped dead.

218
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:43,651
Here.

219
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:45,903
Hey.

220
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,072
I can beat my mom.

221
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:49,949
I do beat her.

222
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:57,915
Wait a minute.

223
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,501
Why two forks?

224
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,004
Why did Mom bring two?

225
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:09,635
Bu-seon!

226
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:11,720
Song Bu-seon!

227
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,349
I think I chose the wrong place to live.

228
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,269
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

229
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,437
Song Bu-seon!

230
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:21,397
Song Bu-seon!

231
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,440
Song Bu-seon! Open the door!

232
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,817
MILITARY MAIL
FROM PARK YEONG-BEOM

233
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,113
Bu-seon.

234
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,658
- Open the door!
- Open up!

235
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,743
- Not gonna open it?
- What the hell?

236
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,537
- Open this door now!
- Oh my God.

237
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,789
Song Bu-seon!

238
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,124
Who are you?

239
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:47,756
Open it now!

240
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,385
Are you crazy?

241
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,637
What are you doing right now?

242
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,854
Hey! Open the door now!

243
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,944
Sir, ma'am, could you please
save me this one time?

244
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,404
My dad will kill me for real.

245
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,197
Please, just once.

246
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:14,616
Just this once.

247
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,494
<i>The fluffy guy had the eyes</i>

248
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,498
<i>of a mole being chased by a hunter.</i>

249
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,423
<i>So I let it happen.</i>

250
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:37,681
Father, I…

251
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:43,312
Well, I wanted to share some steamed buns.

252
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,940
I was wondering how you were settling in.

253
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:48,692
Well,

254
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,944
why are you home so early?

255
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:53,238
How about the factory?

256
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,491
When were you ever interested
in my factory?

257
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,911
This closet is more spacious
than it looks, isn't it?

258
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,496
Dad, what about dinner--

259
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,791
It's perfect for your blankets, isn't it?

260
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,834
Yes, of course it isn't.

261
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,424
"Of course it isn't"?

262
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,718
Actually, you know,

263
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,720
I really should go now.

264
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:17,805
You know what?

265
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,058
We provide the tenant with a wardrobe.

266
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,436
She says she has to go.

267
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,440
Wait… That's where my underwear…

268
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,818
Why open a tenant's wardrobe?

269
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:38,450
I think it's really time
for me to take my leave.

270
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,203
Okay. Yeah, sure.

271
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,210
But why are you standing there?

272
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:52,047
Well, you know…

273
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,301
I was just wondering if a new tenant came.

274
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,428
You never cared
about what happens at home.

275
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,640
You only care about
having the freedom to date.

276
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,226
Come on. That's not…

277
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,354
Come out.

278
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,149
Come out now.

279
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,775
- Dad, you know…
- Mr. Song.

280
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:12,901
Landlord, my lord…

281
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,404
Do you want to walk out?
Or should I drag you out?

282
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,780
Come out!

283
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,449
Cheol-yong, come out.

284
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,494
Come on. We said we'd go easy on them.

285
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,745
Park Cheol-yong!

286
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,331
Come out!

287
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,499
Park Chung-seop!

288
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,126
Park Chung-seop!

289
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,551
<i>When Grandma Min-ok turned 60, she said,</i>

290
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,929
<i>"Morally speaking,</i>

291
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,975
<i>there is no place to hide in a house</i>
<i>but the wardrobe."</i>

292
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:50,731
Excuse me.

293
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,194
Could you…

294
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,207
I'm sorry.

295
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:10,792
So sorry.

296
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:18,342
<i>It was embarrassing,</i>
<i>but that's how we first met.</i>

297
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,139
You punk. Cheol-yong, you little punk.

298
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,017
Your father lost his nails.
Did you even know that?

299
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,811
He works tirelessly
at the wholesale market.

300
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,773
How dare you run away from home like…

301
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,358
How can you…

302
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:41,448
get smaller?

303
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,284
He's smaller.

304
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,584
Cheol-yong?

305
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,353
Who are you?

306
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:17,985
Are you

307
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,404
a girl?

308
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,035
Oh my God.

309
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:54,855
So what happened

310
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,274
to your hair?

311
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:01,278
Did you cut it at home?
Is your family struggling?

312
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,030
No.

313
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:05,490
I was punished.

314
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:11,788
You know,

315
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,583
on the bag…

316
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:18,503
By any chance,
does YEM happen to be "Yang Eun-myeong"?

317
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,255
Yes.

318
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,425
Why do you have Eun-myeong's initials
on your backpack?

319
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,302
Are you guys close?

320
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,055
Are you?

321
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:29,639
We're dating.

322
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:33,602
My goodness.

323
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,147
- It's been 500 days.
- Where's the duster?

324
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:39,816
You need to be beaten 500 times!

325
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,152
But you two started dating
in elementary school.

326
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:43,904
- We're much classier.
- Hey!

327
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,072
Who told you that?

328
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:45,989
Aunt Gyeong-ok!

329
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,241
Call Yang Gyeong-ok over!

330
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,451
Love isn't misconduct!

331
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,036
What'd you say, you punk?

332
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:53,538
<i>This is a silent outcry</i>

333
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,208
<i>A handkerchief of eternal nostalgia</i>

334
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,668
<i>Waving toward the blue sea</i>

335
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,837
<i>Oh, who could it be</i>

336
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:02,547
<i>The first man to hang…</i>

337
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:05,884
At first, I didn't like her
because of her mustache.

338
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,345
But after ten years of seeing her,

339
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:11,181
one day, I stopped noticing it.

340
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:13,975
What was I supposed to do?

341
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:17,354
I don't want to hear this.

342
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:19,564
I'm just a supplement here anyway!

343
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:23,568
But this girl says I'm the best.
She likes me more than her brothers!

344
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:31,159
Good for you, dummy. Happy?

345
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:34,079
<i>Yang Eun-myeong was just like Dad,</i>
<i>a sucker for love…</i>

346
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,705
The thing is,

347
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:39,334
I've always liked naughty boys.

348
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,086
<i>…but not his taste in girls.</i>

349
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,175
But still,

350
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:50,011
you shouldn't have run away from home.

351
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,139
Do your parents know?

352
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:54,433
They probably don't know yet.

353
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,311
I left this morning.

354
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,980
Which school do you go to?

355
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,065
What's your name?

356
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:04,609
Don't you have a name?

357
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:07,112
Hmm… suk.

358
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,324
Can't Suk speak?

359
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:17,622
Bu Hyeon-suk.

360
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,420
Hello.

361
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,426
Why is your last name…

362
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,595
Are you a Bu?

363
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:34,973
Yes.

364
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:36,933
I can't even.

365
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:41,354
<i>How can a love scandal</i>
<i>span two generations in such a small town?</i>

366
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:43,440
<i>It happens because it's a small town.</i>

367
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:47,486
<i>How did they have kids the same age</i>
<i>in such a small town?</i>

368
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:51,740
I couldn't come to help
with your move or to make kimchi.

369
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,242
<i>So, in other words,</i>

370
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:58,121
<i>the two families had their meet-and-greet</i>
<i>when they were both pregnant.</i>

371
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:02,083
Hyeon-suk, never step on a pile of poop.

372
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:05,629
You have to marry a man
like this lady's husband, okay?

373
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:10,467
Hyeon-suk is also about to enter
Dodong Elementary, right?

374
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:15,347
<i>They went to the same school for ten years</i>
<i>in this small town, so no surprise there.</i>

375
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:19,684
Did you give your daughter your all
but go hands-off with your son?

376
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:22,187
Do you know what kind of kids
your son hangs out with?

377
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:26,233
<i>Statistically, it'd be stranger</i>
<i>if they didn't get involved.</i>

378
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:29,027
There's this unbelievable girl
in the girls' class.

379
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,197
He would never cause trouble with girls.

380
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,784
Eun-myeong can't get along with them.

381
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,746
He can't even hang out with his sister.

382
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,208
Is it the same with sisters?
I can't hang out with mine either.

383
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:13,572
<i>But it's more to do with taste</i>
<i>than statistics.</i>

384
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:16,324
<i>Actually, taste can run in the family too.</i>

385
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:21,997
Indecency runs in that family!

386
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,417
<i>I named my daughters</i>

387
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,503
<i>Hyeon-suk for "virtuous"</i>
<i>and Jeong-suk for "pure."</i>

388
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:31,923
<i>And I like those who are virtuous.</i>

389
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:45,353
Bu Hyeon-suk, get out of there now!

390
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,235
At least come in and say hello.

391
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,528
Are they getting married?

392
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:54,863
<i>In my opinion,</i>

393
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:58,533
<i>Sang-gil had a bit of a crush on Ae-sun.</i>

394
00:26:58,617 --> 00:26:59,451
Goddamn it.

395
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:02,454
AUNTIES' SEAFOOD HOUSE

396
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:03,788
He did have a crush.

397
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,793
Passion runs in the family.

398
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:11,921
Everyone in her family
knows nothing but romance.

399
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:13,632
Are you having fun?

400
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,800
Are you mad?

401
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,345
Are you really that mad right now?

402
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:21,056
What's the matter?

403
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,600
You've had quite the spring yourself.

404
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:24,934
There's no stopping spring.

405
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:29,314
Could you have resisted the spring breeze?
Could you or couldn't you?

406
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,860
My dear has a mouth but nothing to say.

407
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,863
Kwon Gye-ok is having a blast.

408
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:39,199
It's like she's waited for this
her whole life.

409
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:43,244
If you're really careful, you'll lose
your son right under your nose too!

410
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,206
Mother, it's your grandson
we're talking about.

411
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:55,590
<i>My strawberry-like innocence at 18</i>

412
00:27:56,216 --> 00:28:02,430
<i>If my own mom doesn't understand me</i>
<i>What should I do?</i>

413
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,182
Are you all planning to be singers?

414
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,559
Stop watching that folk music show.

415
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:10,230
<i>President Roh Tae-woo</i>
<i>has declared war on crime and violence.</i>

416
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,941
People find ways to sleep together
while fleeing.

417
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:17,237
Even in wartime,
flowers bloom, and people fall in love.

418
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,072
Let them be

419
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:21,700
so they can do their thing.

420
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:24,911
<i>To address urgent safety issues</i>
<i>like kidnapping and serial murders…</i>

421
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:27,831
They're now in the spring of their lives.

Go to the Piccadilly

454
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:59,399
Who paints <i>Byeon Kang-soe</i>

455
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,112
Why do you keep trying to make art
with other people's money?

456
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,780
Did you buy these paints?

457
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,575
Did I give you this basement
as your personal gallery?

458
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:12,245
I depicted the joys and sorrows
of Ong-nyeo and Kang-soe

459
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:13,788
through these Korean mountains--

460
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,541
What about my joys and sorrows?

461
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:19,460
I'm the one

I beg you, please. Please have mercy!

467
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:38,396

- I'm not buying.

<i>A basement Picasso.</i>

472
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:49,532
There's a Picasso
in the basement of the Cannes Theater.

473
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,994
He never talks back,
but he's as stubborn as a bull.

474
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:55,955
He hangs his head
like he's done something wrong

475
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,457
but keeps painting his own way.

476
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,084
So who can blame the owner?
I'd lose it too.

477
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,545
So he's actually an artist?

478
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,213
I guess you could say that.

479
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:07,008
Billboard painters
are usually no-name artists.

480
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:08,968
But he doesn't get fired?

481
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:10,678
The owner is a softy.

482
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:11,763
Sorry?

483
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:15,141
He feels bad for yelling,
so buys some snacks and slinks downstairs.

484
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:16,935
I see.

485
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:27,111
So how do you know each other?
Why did he introduce you to us?

486
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,988
I just ran into him somewhere.

487
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:30,865

00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,618

517
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:14,904
I see. A dangerous situation.
You two could become something one day.

518
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:16,197
It's a safe situation.

Nothing's safe between a man and a woman.

You're both wearing safety helmets

00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,805
We've run into each other
in some embarrassing situations.

527
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:46,602
Why are they going there?

528
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,729
Good times.

529
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:49,689
Well, I guess…

530
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,278
I'm not going to date anymore.
Especially not the box office girl.

531
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,282
Hey, stop acting like you're all that
and just date more.

532
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,453
This is still cold.

533
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:08,207
It's a fleeting privilege in a short life.

534
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,550
- You know what?
- What?

535
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,969
- My family doesn't know.
- What?

536
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:21,554
That I'm in Korea.

537
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:24,432
The plan was to come
at the end of the month,

538
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,350
so they don't know I'm here.

539
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,478
You're such a bad boy.

540
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:30,938
Should I tell them?

541
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,357
Should I?

542
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:36,777
Don't you dare.

543
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,697
On the cuteness scale,
you're even cuter than puppies.

544
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:47,622
DAEHAN NEWS

545
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:56,214
Hey, man!

546
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:58,633
Why are you leaving with that on?

547
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:02,970
I chose this place
because of that thing up there.

548
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:07,225
Up there, you'll see
the biggest Christmas tree in Korea.

549
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:09,727
You won't see one that big even in the US.

550
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,899
If I lived too close to the school,
my friends would be over all the time.

551
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,735
Rooms near the school
are always in high demand,

552
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:19,779
so the landlords are total dictators.

553
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:22,740
And I love the fact
that meals aren't included here.

554
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,325
I don't eat much anyway.

555
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:25,952
HELP US FIND OUR MISSING STUDENTS

556
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:27,995
Geum-myeong.

557
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:29,830
Yeah?

558
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,415
What is it?

559
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:33,918
Not here.

560
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,754
Look at this place. It's like Harlem.

561
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:42,468
People who write stuff like that
on other people's walls

562
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:44,053
are all sick in the head.

563
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,722
Why would you pick such a dangerous area?

564
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,850
I can't sleep
if you live in an area like this.

565
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:54,063
Why are they fighting on my way home?

566
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:03,864
That man's an artist.

567
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:07,201
He is treasured by our theater.

568
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,078
So stop overreacting.

569
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:11,664
Who would be okay
with their girlfriend living here?

570
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:13,165
I'd be crazy not to worry.

571
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:14,959
What about this neighborhood?

572
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:17,086
Everyone's doing just fine here.

573
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,840
You should move. Let's go somewhere else.

574
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:24,760
- What about my neighborhood--
- Where exactly?

575
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,345
What, to your apartment?

576
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:27,805
You don't really know Seoul--

577
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:29,849
You're the one who doesn't know Seoul.

578
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,059
You're the one.

579
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:38,357
I'm saying this
because I'm worried about you.

580
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,695
Just go home.
I'm not showing you where I live.

581
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:45,990
All of Korea is like Harlem right now.
Serial murders and--

582
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:47,366
Then go back to America.

583
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,285
Go back, you Yank.

584
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:56,459
Don't you dare follow me.

585
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:06,761
<i>I've never seen him smile. Ever.</i>

586
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,388
He keeps his mouth shut all the time.

587
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:12,600
Even if I tried to strike up
a conversation with him…

588
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:15,561
You could've just eaten the ones
that were open.

589
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:19,273
Why do you think he bought the dumplings?

590
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,235
So why did you yell at him again?

591
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:25,446
You're wasting money on dumplings.

592
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,323
Give them to him yourself.

593
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:32,745
Our Picasso painted <i>Madame Aema,</i>
but he didn't use any skin-tone paint.

594
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:34,538
How does that make any sense?

595
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:48,969
AEMA WANTS TO RIDE AGAIN
MADAME AEMA

596
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,810
How has he still not been fired
after this?

597
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,677
Does he sleep here as well?

598
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:37,309
BAEK SEOK'S POETRY COLLECTION

599
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:50,614
ME, NATASHA, AND THE WHITE DONKEY

600
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:55,369
THOUGH I'M POOR
I LOVED THE BEAUTIFUL NATASHA

601
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,163
SO TONIGHT, THE SNOW WHUMPFS DOWN

602
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:01,584
Because you're not interested in money?

603
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:04,795
Because you're a noble artist, right?

604
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:09,842
I'm not the one who's broke,
so why should I go on about money?

605
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:12,595
You don't care about money,
so it's all fine?

606
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:14,555
To be by your side,

607
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:17,266
I have to think about money all day long.

608
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:19,351
"How much were the pork cutlet
and tickets?"

609
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:23,814
Even for a trip, I'd think,
"You have no money. It'd be a burden."

610
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:27,193
We dated for three years
and never went to a nice restaurant.

611
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:29,862
Just those stupid <i>kalguksu </i>and <i>jjolmyeon,</i>
over and over.

612
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:32,907
Dating you makes me a cheap person!

613
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,033
Is that art?

614
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,036
Is that what your art stands for?

615
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:42,458
How many more times will you come
and vent your anger before your wedding?

616
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:45,503
Just leave. No need to save face.

617
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:46,879
You can just go.

618
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:48,130
You'll just let me go?

619
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,215
- I'm tired too.
- What?

620
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:51,759
You've been on six blind dates
since we got together.

621
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:53,385
It's not fair.

622
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:55,429
I'm done.

623
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:58,390
I don't think I like you enough anymore

624
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,602
to put up with all the unfairness.

625
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:05,648
You have someone?

626
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,032
You got a new girl?

627
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:17,952
Is that why you're acting all tough?

628
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:19,578
Like you are?

629
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,583
Why aren't you answering?

630
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:28,629
You have someone,
yet you're acting like the victim.

631
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:31,840
So what do you want me to do?
If I tell you to stay, will you?

632
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,556
<i>Perhaps it was since then.</i>

633
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:43,310
<i>My landlord's daughter</i>
<i>started kicking my shoes outside my room.</i>

634
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:49,108
Well,

635
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,777
I brought you some dumplings.

636
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:56,198
The projectionist insisted
I bring these to you.

637
00:42:57,366 --> 00:43:00,035
I'm really not sure
why I always run into you

638
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,620
when you are

639
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,540
in these embarrassing situations.

640
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:06,417
I don't believe this.

641
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,547
PART-TIME USHER
CANNES THEATER

642
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,424
Did you help her get a job here?

643
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:16,510
Well…

644
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:20,806
You've been hiding a honeypot
in the theater?

645
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:22,641
How nice of her.

646
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,393
She even packed food for you.

647
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:25,561
This is…

648
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,146
Hey.

649
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:29,982
Why won't you say anything?

650
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:31,650
You should say something.

651
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:33,110
I can't believe this.

652
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:36,030
She'd fit right in with your family.

653
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,035
Can't sort the wheat from the chaff?
You always come up empty.

654
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:45,664
You dropped out of high school, right?
She goes to SNU.

655
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:47,666
Watch your words.

656
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:52,588
<i>The fall breeze turned into</i>
<i>the spring breeze.</i>

657
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:57,009
<i>The whistling sound</i>
<i>never ceased in my heart.</i>

658
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,973
THE WIND GOES WHOOSH
MY HEART GOES BOO-HOO.

659
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:53,477
"JUST GET READY AND GO,
RIDE THE MOMENT WITH ALL YOU HAVE."

660
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:02,820
