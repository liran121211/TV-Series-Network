00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,982
WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU TANGERINES

2
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,114
<i>♪ Yesterday ♪</i>

3
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:18,578
<i>♪ All my troubles seemed so far away… ♪</i>

4
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:19,913
Oh goodness.

5
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,374
It's all right. A poem can be simple.

6
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,753
You just write down the things
you'd like to say.

7
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,254
That's all there is to it.

8
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,340
<i>♪ Suddenly… ♪</i>

9
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,300
<i>Ok-sim, make us food</i>

10
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:35,011
<i>Look at me, give me food</i>

11
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,304
<i>Hey, Mom</i>

12
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,931
<i>Food, food, food</i>

13
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,850
<i>Stop saying, "Ok-sim, make me food"</i>

14
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:44,104
<i>I must have spent my whole life</i>
<i>Making food</i>

15
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,608
Think about the things
you've always wanted to say the most.

16
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:53,029
<i>"Respect Your Elders"</i>
<i>by Lee Byeong-seon.</i>

17
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,283
<i>Eyes fading, ears fading too</i>

18
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,536
<i>Sons and daughters</i>

19
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,413
<i>My back is killing me</i>

20
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,792
<i>Please come and visit me often</i>

21
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:10,713
Someone hasn't written a single word yet.

22
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:14,801
Just write down
what you want to say the most.

23
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,929
That's how you write a poem about life.

24
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:22,809
<i>♪ Oh, I believe in yesterday ♪</i>

25
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:27,397
<i>♪ Why she had to go ♪</i>

26
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,860
<i>♪ I don't know, she wouldn't say ♪</i>

27
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:37,240
<i>♪ I said something wrong ♪</i>

28
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,741
<i>♪ Now I long… ♪</i>

29
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,410
<i>I didn't know back then</i>

30
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,329
<i>that I'd ever reach the age of 70.</i>

31
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,873
<i>♪ Yesterday… </i>♪

32
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:49,711
<i>♪ Love was such an easy game to play ♪</i>

33
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,723
<i>I didn't know back then…</i>

34
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,685
<i>…that what I'd want to say the most at 70</i>

35
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,564
<i>is a word</i>
<i>I said more than any other, every day.</i>

36
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,983
Mom.

37
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:49,938
Mom.

38
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,613
Hey, Mom.

39
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:01,783
Mom!

40
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,289
Mom!

41
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,083
Mom!

42
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,209
Mom!

43
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:14,212
Hey, Mom! Hey!

44
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,173
Come out quickly, Mom! Hurry up!

45
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,592
Why are you always
the last one to come out?

46
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,138
Oh, come on!

47
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,891
Are abalones more important
than your daughter?

48
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,227
Why did you go back down?

49
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,521
Are you doing it just to annoy me?

50
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,399
Mom! Come on!

51
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:36,818
There's green laver all over
the ocean floor in the spring.

52
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,444
That greedy woman won't come out.

53
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,905
Hey, Ae-sun, leave your mother alone.

54
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,241
Instead, look at the color
of Mr. Yang's cheeks!

55
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,953
It's just sunburn. I told you.

56
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:50,123
Oh, something's burning all right,
young man. It's his little heart.

57
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,041
Only Ae-sun can't see it!

58
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:54,752
Can you imagine that?

59
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,921
A <i>haenyeo's </i>daughter marrying
a fish merchant?

60
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,382
All of Jeju would be out of business!

61
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,093
You're so damn annoying!

62
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,515
She's going over. Look.

63
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,060
Did someone smack you or what?

64
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,645
Why are your cheeks always red?

65
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:16,190
She's turned him down again.

66
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,995
My mom should have just given birth
to an abalone instead of me.

67
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,247
Mr. Yang.

68
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,375
There are two conches. Here.

69
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,128
Get us a fair price
for them, all right?

70
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:38,838
Yes, ma'am.

71
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:42,342
Did you swim down the hall of
the Dragon King for that seaweed?

72
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:46,054
It's not the sea
that kills <i>haenyeo. </i>It's greed.

73
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:49,182
Greed is deadlier than the sea,
and that's a fact.

74
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,643
By the way,
how is Grandma from Hallim doing?

75
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,729
Her lungs won't ever recover.

76
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:57,815
She can only make a living
from what we put in these bags,

77
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,317
so let's keep her alive, eh?

78
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,819
Is there only seaweed in this one?

79
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,155
Mom wants at least a few abalones.

80
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,656
There's a few there, see?

81
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,034
Abalones are tiny in the spring.

82
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,620
There's not much for them to eat.

83
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,666
You may as well give
the whole thing away! Just take it all!

84
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,627
There she goes again, losing her shit.

85
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,253
Grandma from Hallim has three sons.

86
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,506
Why are we the ones
to have to feed those hungry kids?

87
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:25,343
I don't risk my life for them,
diving into that hellscape every day.

88
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,804
I do it for my own children.

89
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,723
I don't dive for abalones
to feed someone else's family.

90
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,309
You think you're special, huh?

91
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,144
Who taught you everything you know?

92
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,563
Who do you owe for being able
to feed your children?

93
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:41,025
My children depend on what I catch
to feed them. Same as you.

94
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,569
We can't afford to be feeding
a sick grandma too.

95
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,321
I'm not giving up my abalone.

96
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,825
Just the thought infuriates me.
Make sure you count 'em.

97
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,327
What do you think made her sick
in the first place?

98
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,372
We'd do the same for you
if you were bedridden.

99
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:56,040
I will never be bedridden.

100
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:59,085
<i>Haenyeo </i>live and die together.
None of us can do it alone.

101
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:02,880
Well, if you're all such saints,
what do you need the Dragon King for?

102
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:06,175
I thought that new husband
would satisfy you,

103
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,010
but you're just greedier than ever.

104
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,305
How can you pamper that lazy man

105
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,766
and think your abalones
are too good for <i>sanggun?</i>

106
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,852
We were both poor as dirt
when we came here together.

107
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,979
At least I remember who taught us to dive.

108
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:20,481
If you can't respect what
Hallim Grandma did for us,

109
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,650
you're worth less than a snailfish.

110
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:25,778
If you're so much better than me,
why is your husband's face paralyzed?

111
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,073
That was because he slept out in the cold!

112
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,534
His face is paralyzed
because he barely eats.

113
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,703
Huh? You gonna tell me I'm wrong?

114
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,247
You don't get
to talk to me that way.

115
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,707
You're no better than I am.

116
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,376
At least I don't have children
with two different men!

117
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,919
- Easy now.
- Gyeong-ja.

118
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,505
- Enough.
- Here we go again.

119
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,134
She always starts a fight
right before we go home.

120
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,268
Wha-- Hey, what?

121
00:07:58,436 --> 00:07:59,395
What are you--

122
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,857
Damn it. You damn brat.
What did you do that for? Shit!

123
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,110
Ugh! You spilled my conches everywhere!
You damn menace!

124
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:07,528
Damn it!

125
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,990
Why the hell did I bring her with me
when I came here?

126
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,368
- Oh, what a waste! They're ruined!
- Happens when you poke a puffer fish.

127
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:17,997
When a woman is fighting to survive,
you stay out of her way.

128
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,124
What a damn waste.

129
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,628
Why don't you try kicking that leech
of a husband you keep at home

130
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,713
instead of taking it out on my catch?

131
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:48,402
You can't spare a second
for your daughter.

132
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:51,072
I won a prize,
but you only care about those snails.

133
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,698
What good does a poem do?

134
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,368
Does writing a poem
bring home any abalones?

135
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,370
Can't you just read it, Mom?

136
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,539
It won second prize in school.

137
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,207
Go and show your grandmother.

138
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,251
The Oh family likes its scholars.

139
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,298
Show it to her and… and then say,
"Please keep me in school."

140
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,425
Grandma hates me.

141
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,178
She says I remind her
more of you every day.

142
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,681
That's why she can't stand
the sight of me.

143
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,641
Go on to your own house for supper.

144
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,810
I told them I'd eat with you.

145
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,437
Go. Your stepdad's coming.

146
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,147
Who cares, Mom?

147
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,691
Can't I have dinner here?

148
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:29,110
I want a conch
with the red seaweed you picked.

149
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,947
A daughter of the Oh family
should eat at the Oh household.

150
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,408
Uncle won't even give me a yellow croaker.

151
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,703
What do you mean, he doesn't?

152
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:41,747
He says having a girl around
who gets good grades and awards

153
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,207
is stealing all his son's luck.

154
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,544
He says it's my fault
Oh Jong-gu is at the bottom of his class.

155
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,505
The yellow croaker
isn't even the worst part.

156
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,883
It's how he treats me at the table.

157
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,260
It's not fair.

158
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,512
I'm so sad that I can hardly eat.

159
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:58,598
Every time I'm there,

160
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,349
I just get too choked up.

161
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,061
Please, Mom,
can I just live here with you?

162
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,605
Can I?

163
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,732
Maybe someday?

164
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,111
- Never, ever?
- What are you choked up for anyway?

165
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,362
Did you do something wrong?

166
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,115
How do you expect anyone to love you
acting like that?

167
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:18,951
Go.

168
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:19,869
Go!

169
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,955
Learn how to defend yourself. Figure out
some way to make them love you.

170
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,042
Well, what do you know?
Sun-ae is here again.

171
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,376
Ae-sun, not Sun-ae!

172
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,586
Are you an idiot?

173
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,296
Ae-sun, right.

174
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,006
Staying for dinner?

175
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,342
No, I'm going home.

176
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,316
That little brat.

177
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,531
Daddy. Have some water.

178
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,283
Thanks.

179
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,619
She's always such a pain in the ass.

180
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,665
<i>Cigarettes can kill you, Mom.</i>

181
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,585
<i>Haenyeo </i>rely on their lungs.
You must have a death wish.

182
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,554
<i>Why don't you just let her live with us?</i>

183
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:23,808
For one thing,
she'd be much better off here.

184
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,017
Surely you see that.

185
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,522
You do nothing for your
own family, so mind your own business.

186
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:32,149
We don't have the money
or space to raise her.

187
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,652
This tiny hut we rent
is too small as it is.

188
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:37,697
You blame a child for wanting
to feel her mother's embrace?

189
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:41,659
Why do you care?
You prefer her to a cow.

190
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,994
You want her to look after
her half-siblings?

191
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,372
She'll always be family to you.

192
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:51,335
Look, the only reason we're living here
is so you can be close to her.

193
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:54,630
She's over practically every day
whenever she has the chance.

194
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:59,760
She can't wait to live here with you,
but you insist on keeping her there.

195
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,096
You're just setting her up for heartache.

196
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:05,599
The Oh family has money. At least there,
she'll get a proper education.

197
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:09,186
What's the point of letting a girl get
an education? It'll just frustrate her.

198
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,272
Oh!

199
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:14,817
Don't <i>haenyeo </i>start learning
how to dive when they're teenagers?

200
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,736
Would you say that about
your own daughter?

201
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,863
Is that the kind of life you want for her?

202
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,454
You damn island women
will pick a fight over anything.

203
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,956
I will never let her dive.

204
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,917
You're better off being born a cow
than a <i>haenyeo</i>.

205
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,879
I slave away every day for nothing!

206
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:37,214
It's unbelievable
what we're expected to endure.

207
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,717
What good would living here do her anyway?

208
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,720
She's too soft.
She'll end up being your maid.

209
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,555
Guess I'll throw this out, then.

210
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,726
Reading it would just break your heart.

211
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,729
Stop, you're crumpling it!

212
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:54,690
That's no way to treat a winner.
It won second place.

213
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:58,819
There, there.

214
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,281
I mean it.
You're better off not reading it.

215
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,463
{\an8}GYONGGI NOODLE

216
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,223
This is an "F," kid.
"F" as in you're a fool.

217
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:47,368
That kid must have a death wish too.

218
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:56,961
I only bought five.

219
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:58,963
There's an extra one for free.

220
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,673
Did your mom say that?

221
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,094
Well, did she?

222
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:09,515
You have six people in your family,
but for some reason, you only buy five.

223
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,934
Think you're rich enough
to give 'em away, is that it?

224
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,477
Mind your own business.

225
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,022
He's so annoying.

226
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:18,691
Yi-suk.

227
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:19,859
- Huh?
- Here.

228
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:20,818
Yeah?

229
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:25,447
Ae-sun, start with the pot.
Wash the pot first.

230
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,534
Oh. What? What is that woman doing?

231
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,383
Here are some damn yellow croakers!

232
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,887
What is the meaning of this?
Have you gone nuts?

233
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,388
How dare you come in here and--

234
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,598
Money's tight, huh?

235
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,183
- Wh… wh… what?
- You can't afford to feed my little girl?

236
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:57,146
And you, mother-in-law,
isn't she a daughter of the Oh family?

237
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,857
Are you so surprised
that she takes after her father?

238
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:02,276
It's not just wrong.

239
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,235
It's mad!

240
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,446
Your dear son!

241
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,031
Your eldest brother!

242
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:09,450
Right now, he's turning in his grave!

243
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,368
I can see why
he couldn't survive your marriage.

244
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,746
How dare you come here
and blather about my brother!

245
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:20,169
You must be possessed by a demon
or God-knows-what.

246
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,547
You blame me for my husband's death,
is that it?

247
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:25,925
Don't you feel sorry for her?

248
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,010
The girl who lost her father?

249
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:34,058
That's it. I'm taking my daughter now.

250
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,688
Damn you, making her do your dishes.

251
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,066
How dare you!

252
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:04,296
I'm glad they never gave me any croaker
'cause I get to live with you now.

253
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,091
You like me that much, huh?

254
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,137
What's my secret?

255
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,472
You're my mom.

256
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:14,932
Goodness.

257
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,559
I like you because you're my mom.

258
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,103
Why would you ask that?

259
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:20,938
You like me so much?

260
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,439
Better grow up.

261
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,525
'Cause every day,

262
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,528
I'll be expecting my hundred won.

263
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,613
You read my poem!

264
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,541
<i>"Damn Abalones"</i>

265
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:43,627
<i>written by Oh Ae-sun,</i>
<i>third grade, class eight.</i>

266
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,964
<i>All day, every day, abalones, abalones</i>

267
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,842
<i>When the typhoon blows, abalones, abalones</i>

268
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:52,636
<i>Worth more than a daughter</i>
<i>Those damn abalones</i>

269
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,098
<i>"Hurry back," I tell her</i>
<i>When she dives in the sea</i>

270
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,726
<i>What could down there</i>
<i>So cold and so deep be?</i>

271
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,229
<i>Is she looking for clams</i>
<i>Buried under the sand?</i>

272
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,898
<i>Did she run out of breath?</i>
<i>Will she come back to land?</i>

273
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,234
<i>Why does a daughter</i>
<i>Wait here on the shore?</i>

274
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:10,362
<i>Because damn abalones</i>
<i>That's what it's all for</i>

275
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,909
<i>If abalones cost a hundred won to find</i>

276
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,579
<i>I'd pay it all back</i>
<i>For a day of Mom's time</i>

277
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,081
<i>My mom with her sore back</i>

278
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,208
<i>My mom with her bad cough</i>

279
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:28,088
<i>A hundred won per day</i>
<i>If it means my mom can rest</i>

280
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:42,603
Did you ever hear of such a daughter
who can write like this?

281
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,939
How did I get so lucky?

282
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,574
Told you so.

283
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:15,135
Give me 100 won every single day,
and I won't have to dive.

284
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:18,931
That way,

285
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,892
I'll have all day
to spend with my daughter.

286
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,354
You see why it was second place?

287
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,189
Judges must have been blind.

288
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,024
You didn't like it?

289
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,818
They only gave it second place?

290
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,986
They should've made it first!

291
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:53,882
Don't mistreat her.

292
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,510
If you do,
your ass will be out on the street.

293
00:18:56,593 --> 00:19:00,764
My dear, you have no luck with husbands,
but your children are another story.

294
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,016
Oh, this little brat.

295
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,269
The worst brat of all brats.

296
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,729
Still a pain in the ass.

297
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,440
I'd take a brat like that
any day of the week.

298
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,447
My father and mother
were up to their ears in debt.

299
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,658
My first husband was bedridden.

300
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,369
And my second husband's a deadbeat.

301
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:25,330
I've accepted it.
It was my destiny to bear all that weight.

302
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,250
All anyone did was
climb onto my back to be carried.

303
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,420
This tiny thing.

304
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,006
She keeps climbing down.

305
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,718
She keeps asking
to share some of the burden.

306
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,183
And that makes her a brat, um,

307
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:48,270
because that's the thing
that breaks my heart more than anything.

308
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,564
Just you wait.

309
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:54,359
That brat will be taking care of you
long into the afterlife.

310
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:58,822
My goodness. I'm a worthless mother
who wouldn't even dare to dream.

311
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,577
I can't leave her yet.

312
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,621
I wanna be around

313
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:09,958
to see the day
when the world praises her as a scholar.

314
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:15,464
She'll be the next Han Seok-bong one day,
mark my words.

315
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,466
Our Ae-sun.

316
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:21,220
If any of us can make
something of our lives, it's her.

317
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,519
{\an8}THE FIFTH NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ELECTION

318
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:37,486
Oh my, do you realize that,
thanks to you, I have a new title now?

319
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,823
You, being VP of your class,
makes me a VP's mother.

320
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,533
Let's celebrate with rice cakes.

321
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:46,328
Who said
I wanted to be vice president?

322
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,996
The whole fishing industry is like that.

323
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,666
Behind every captain
is a vice captain ready to lead.

324
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,669
If everyone's on top,
then who's vice president?

325
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,255
The second-in-command has more influence.

326
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:59,508
Who would wanna be second-in-command?

327
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,635
I've never even been a hall monitor.

328
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:05,430
I want "Ae-sun, voted vice president"
written in the family history book.

329
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,642
Don't write that down.
Don't you dare write that down!

330
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:11,395
You know, I thought Oh Ae-sun
was actually voted president.

331
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,563
Uh-huh, I'm sure she was.

332
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:16,400
You just make sure to serve
your president well, then.

333
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:20,195
Ae-sun got 37 votes,
Lee Man-ki only got 28.

334
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,197
So why is Lee Man-ki class president?

335
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,199
Why do I have to be vice president?

336
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,201
My presidency was stolen!

337
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:27,828
"It was stolen"?

338
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:31,331
CLASS PRESIDENT ELECTION
OH AE-SUN, LEE MAN-KI

339
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:34,334
Don't you think
you're being a little selfish here?

340
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,837
I don't get it. I got 37 votes.

341
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,341
Honestly, you have some nerve, young lady.

342
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,846
Didn't you eat the cream buns
Man-ki's father handed out?

343
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,726
And haven't we all enjoyed the floors
waxed with the candles he gave us?

344
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:54,521
But I still got 37 votes.

345
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,443
I say it was unethical of them
to not vote for Man-ki

346
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,069
after taking the stuff he gave them.

347
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,656
A real leader needs to have it all. Eh?

348
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,868
Both the material aspect,
as well as the moral.

349
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:08,785
You know?

350
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,079
But I got 37 votes.

351
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,708
Who cares how many votes you got?
You may as well have a hundred!

352
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:15,792
Because in the real world,

353
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,128
it doesn't matter a bit
who gets more votes!

354
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,838
I'm sorry, but between you and Man-ki,

355
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:24,843
there's a certain something
that just matters more. Understand?

356
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:32,351
It'll be embarrassing for you
to get kicked out.

357
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,810
There's no shame in just resigning.

358
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:35,812
It's for the greater good.

359
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:38,148
Sometimes you have to lose to win.

360
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,195
A loser is still a loser.

361
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:46,114
And nothing I do will change that!

362
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,699
Why is this happening to me?

363
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,034
It's not fair!

364
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,410
Oh, cut it out!

365
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,287
Why are you chasing that crap?

366
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,748
Look at the posters of the men
running for office.

367
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:56,875
They're all going bankrupt for nothing.

368
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,877
But the presidency is mine!

369
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,880
Give me back my presidency!

370
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:27,572
After that fit you threw,
I thought you'd never come see us again.

371
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:30,325
You know, if I'm being completely honest,

372
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:33,036
your household needs a rude awakening.

373
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,205
Did they want a daughter-in-law or a cow?

374
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:37,833
I mean, really, how the hell
are you gonna plow this field?

375
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,042
Well, I can't pay you.

376
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,715
Uh, will you just go? Go on!

377
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:48,677
My mother-in-law
would kill me if she found out.

378
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,555
Besides, you can just run away.

379
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:54,391
I'm afraid my ghost will be
haunting that family forever.

380
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:57,269
I can plow this for you
and get all the sesame as well.

381
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:58,937
I swear, I can't pay.

382
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,858
What, you don't believe me? Just look.

383
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:03,859
I have nothing.

384
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:07,070
Yes, you do. You know what I mean?

385
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,574
- Huh?
- Do whatever you want with me.

386
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,868
Nothing will change the fact
that I'm penniless, okay?

387
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,370
Please. I don't want cash.

388
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,331
I'm after the… thing.

389
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:19,666
Uh…

390
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,419
Y… Y… You know.

391
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,007
No way. Impossible.

392
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,634
Why not? Why not?

393
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:33,054
I'll plow the whole field for you.
And harvest all the rest too.

394
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,265
I'm doing all this.
You could at least let me borrow it.

395
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:38,351
There's no way in hell.
I don't even wear it. It's so pricey.

396
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:43,773
Listen, in just two days,
I'll plow this entire field.

397
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:47,110
We can pretend you borrowed a cow
or something, all right?

398
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:53,241
Come on.
Who lends their wedding jewelry out?

399
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,744
You should have asked for something
when you remarried.

400
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:59,164
Don't you know me by now?
I work harder than a cow.

401
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,109
STUPID ABALONE

402
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,529
THE LOYAL LEE FAMILY
BY LEE MAN-KI FROM CLASS 3-8

403
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:34,491
A loyal family. Yeah, right.

404
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:36,368
You think a child wrote this?

405
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,703
Obviously,
the parents did the whole thing.

406
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:41,498
Hey.

407
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:43,333
Come look at these.

408
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:45,919
This one is clearly the best, hmm?

409
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:48,838
Who cares about the gold frame?

410
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:51,800
This one here is much better written.
Don't you agree?

411
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,511
Well, I see.

412
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,514
The general's son's always first, hmm?

413
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,849
The general's son
gets to be class president?

414
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,519
We all have to bow down
to the general's son?

415
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:04,729
Ho-ho! We'll see about that!

416
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,232
Excuse me, ma'am?

417
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,192
Are you Ae-sun's aunt?

418
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,447
- Please, have a seat.
- Thank you.

419
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:25,000
MASTERMIND OF THE 3.15 ELECTION FRAUD

420
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:36,219
So… I'm not Ae-sun's aunt.

421
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,971
I'm her mother.

422
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,849
Oh, oh. Oh, of course.

423
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,810
She's always had a mom, just so you know.

424
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,604
Yes, right.

425
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:47,689
I was so busy making a living,

426
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:50,191
I never had the chance to visit you.

427
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,654
I brought along some rice cakes
for you to share with the students.

428
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,282
Hmm, you shouldn't have.

429
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,869
Actually, I brought these for a reason.

430
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:06,958
My daughter is
a very "presidential" vice president.

431
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,881
She's also a first-place,
second-place winner.

432
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,554
What did my teacher say?
Did he admit I won?

433
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,264
Did he say I could be president again?

434
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:25,018
You got angry, didn't you?

435
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:27,479
Did you make a scene
like you did at Grandma's place?

436
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,689
I made a scene, all right.

437
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,900
He'll think twice
before opening his mouth.

438
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:36,446
Yes, well, the students and I
will enjoy these…

439
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:38,740
Uh, my child is in your care,

440
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:41,826
and… and I'm just trying
to make a decent living.

441
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:45,080
Of course.
I have 70 students in this class.

442
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:48,541
They're always so hungry,
as you can imagine.

443
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,836
So I'm not sure this will be enough
to share with everyone.

444
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:55,757
Well, I'm sure that all their parents
feel the same way I do.

445
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,134
Please, if you would,

446
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,512
take kindly to my daughter.

447
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:02,639
Does it make a difference
if I take kindly to her?

448
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,349
Every child has to earn it. Hmm.

449
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,976
The rice cakes might not be enough,

450
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:11,815
but surely, every parent on earth wants
their child to be loved by their teacher.

451
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,110
Uh, if I could have,

452
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,570
I would have brought a cow for you

453
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,322
if I had one.

454
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,076
But I got you these.

455
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:24,994
Oh, you didn't have to do that.

456
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:28,331
Ae-sun's teacher should keep
his feet warm. That's what I thought.

457
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,669
Nylon. They're nylon.

458
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:58,695
She has manners.

459
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,369
That's too much. She shouldn't have.

460
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,664
Did she go out of her way
to stop by the bank?

461
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,166
These are new bills.

462
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,627
Why are you so dressed up?

463
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,963
Because I didn't want
to smell like the sea.

464
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:19,507
I was always taught
to show my teachers respect,

465
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:22,594
so I didn't want me
or the rice cakes to smell salty.

466
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:26,139
Listen to your teacher.
It's the only way to get ahead.

467
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:28,099
Wouldn't it be great to make a living

468
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,643
sitting at a desk,
writing like your teacher does?

469
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,396
But he's not giving
my presidency back, is he?

470
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:37,192
He wants you to buy him something,
right? Like a broom?

471
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:41,279
Well, that's the "material" part, I guess.

472
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:44,574
You know, I've been thinking,
and vice president is better.

473
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,285
My title might have the word "vice"
in front of it,

474
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:49,454
but it's basically the same role.

475
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:53,374
I don't lead the class in the morning bow.
But otherwise, it's the same job.

476
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,710
When Lee Man-ki says, "Attention, bow,"

477
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,670
I say it to myself under my breath.

478
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,090
Honestly, vice president is better.

479
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:07,889
Ae-sun, your mom is not wealthy,

480
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:09,849
but you are you, okay?

481
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:11,893
Don't ever back down.

482
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,061
If you want it,

483
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:14,979
go and get it.

484
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,399
I won't back down if you won't, Ma.

485
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,820
When I'm all grown up,
you know the first thing I wanna do?

486
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,787
What's gotten into you?

487
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:32,831
I need to live a long life.

488
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:36,209
Today, my daughter promised me
that when she grows up,

489
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,711
she'll buy me a pearl necklace.

490
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,588
I can't miss out on that.

491
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:43,091
Oh boy. In which lifetime?

492
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:46,094
Children grow up
before you know it.

493
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:48,847
I'll have my pearl necklace
in the blink of an eye.

494
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:53,393
It's not just children who grow up fast.
Before you know it, we'll be old too.

495
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:55,436
I just read it in the news.

496
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,439
The average life expectancy
of Koreans is 52.

497
00:30:58,523 --> 00:30:59,774
I'm gonna beat that.

498
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:03,403
I'll be 70, enjoying all the rewards
that come with it.

499
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:05,280
And, you know, once I get there,

500
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,741
the little pain I'm in now,
it'll be laughable.

501
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:09,993
Just funny.

502
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,963
Hang on, but I didn't quit cigarettes.

503
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,381
You will from today.

504
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,427
Hey!

505
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:29,721
Very funny. Knock it off.

506
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,307
- Ah, ah, ah…
- You gotta be kidding.

507
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,655
<i>Spring is oh-so-short.</i>

508
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:50,199
<i>Just as soon as it arrives,</i>

509
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,869
<i>the flower celebration</i>
<i>is over before we know it.</i>

510
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,834
<i>The heartless passage of time.</i>

511
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,023
Will you stop being so damn stubborn?

512
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:25,902
You can barely hold your breath.
You can't dive anymore.

513
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:27,695
You can all quit your nagging.

514
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,073
These walls will rot
before I let myself die.

515
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:33,284
You keep diving with
the smell the blood in your lungs.

516
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,203
You may as well dive with
a coffin on your back.

517
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,747
Death is all the same on land or sea.

518
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,749
Hey. Can't you see the Grim Reaper

519
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:41,709
standing right outside
your house over there?

520
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:45,171
He's standing there with his black cloak,
waiting for you.

521
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:48,591
If you go into the sea, that Grim Reaper
over there will follow you.

522
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:51,803
He'll peek his head under the waves
and snatch your soul right out of you.

523
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:55,014
If I was scared of him, I would never
have gone into the water.

524
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,933
<i>Haenyeo's </i>lives are one big gamble.

525
00:32:57,016 --> 00:33:00,311
I've overcome death countless times
in the great blue ocean.

526
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,732
Are you just afraid?
Afraid your children will starve?

527
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:08,152
Gwang-rye. <i>Haenyeo </i>live and die together.

528
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,279
We'll make sure
you don't go hungry, please.

529
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:13,449
Enough! I won't die begging.
I'll die making another buck.

530
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:16,202
I won't stop
until my child has more than I had.

531
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,245
I can't die.

532
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:19,163
I won't die.

533
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,332
You know why ghosts haunt people?

534
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:25,837
Your regret will become anguish.
Then obsession will turn you into a ghost.

535
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,256
I'm not afraid of ghosts.
I fear for my children.

536
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,758
I will take everything I can
from the underworld

537
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,386
and give it to my children,
or I will die trying.

538
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:39,392
Well done.
She can't go diving without those clothes.

539
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:40,560
That little brat.

540
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:42,979
I should have never taken her back.

541
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,197
OH AE-SUN IS YANG GWAN-SIK'S WIFE
AE-SUN IS GETTING MARRIED

542
00:33:57,493 --> 00:34:01,414
Am I a beggar?
Do you think I'm a beggar?

543
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,389
You leave my mother alone!

544
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,309
Just please, leave her alone!

545
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:24,145
What's wrong with you, Dragon King?

546
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:27,190
Why do you take the lives
of innocent people? Why?

547
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:33,154
Show her some mercy, please!

548
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:35,364
You can't do this to her.

549
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,950
You can't do this to her.

550
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:41,412
My mom worked herself
to the bone her entire life.

551
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:45,124
She never even got on a plane.

552
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,627
I have to get her a pearl necklace.

553
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,338
I have to put her on a plane!

554
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:53,466
I was gonna do it all for her!

555
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,636
Why?

556
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,262
Why?

557
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:03,059
Why?

558
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,108
What's wrong with you?

559
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,818
Are you a ghost or what?

560
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,362
Why aren't you saying anything, Gwan-sik?

561
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:15,696
What do you want from me?

562
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,657
What? What?

563
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,200
Come here.

564
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:22,203
- What?
- Come!

565
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:28,960
Another fish?

566
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:31,295
You think nobody feeds me except for you?

567
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,633
It's not fish. It's chicken.

568
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:39,303
We don't share our meat with just
anybody around here, you know?

569
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:41,681
Are you stupid?

570
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:43,975
You must be stupid.

571
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,269
Crying makes you hungry.

572
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:48,521
Do you feel sorry for me?

573
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:50,606
Is that what all the food is about?

574
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:53,276
If that were true,
I would've given that to a beggar.

575
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:57,488
You are always so annoying.

576
00:35:58,614 --> 00:35:59,740
Hey.

577
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:02,160
I'm your elder.

578
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,464
Even if you brought me beef every day,

579
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,800
we still wouldn't get married.

580
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,343
Who says I want to?

581
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,906
She has to live. She has to.

582
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:43,534
What will happen
to her poor little children?

583
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:48,998
Mother.

584
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:52,960
Mother.

585
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:03,888
Mother, can we go somewhere together?

586
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,349
I'm a little scared.

587
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:23,115
What is it?

588
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:24,700
Sh.

589
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,038
Is that you, Mom?

590
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:55,940
It's like I'm in <i>Aesop's Fable,</i>
and I found the golden axe.

591
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,442
Hold on, am I the axe?

592
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:02,697
Are you going somewhere, Mom?

593
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,783
Why didn't you just wait until tomorrow?

594
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,327
If I had, the others would have stolen it.

595
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:11,330
You could have sold them
for a hundred won.

596
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,419
Feeding you makes it worth a thousand won.

597
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,346
Ae-sun,

598
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:29,890
if I ever die…

599
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,978
leave this house immediately.

600
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:37,565
Go to your uncle and beg for your life.

601
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:40,234
Don't stay here as their housekeeper.

602
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,822
No matter what, go.

603
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:46,741
Promise me.

604
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:48,534
Don't…

605
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,328
don't say that.

606
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:56,917
Stay there until your uncle
gives you away to your husband.

607
00:38:57,001 --> 00:39:00,546
The thought of you walking down
the aisle alone would make me cry.

608
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:03,466
Why are you telling me this?
You know I can't.

609
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,595
I won't sleep until you promise.

610
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:09,930
Dad is dead,

611
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,516
and now you're dying too.

612
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,935
Why is everyone dying?

613
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,689
I wish I'd never been born.

614
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:21,609
Ae-sun.

615
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:23,944
All parents have to die.

616
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:25,696
It happens to everyone.

617
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,407
But after our parents are gone,

618
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,534
their children live on.

619
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:31,869
I know you will too.

620
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:35,247
There will be days when life is hard.

621
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,959
Once in a while, there may be days

622
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,379
when you feel like
giving up on life altogether.

623
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,547
Stop. Stop talking like that.

624
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:45,383
I won't promise you.

625
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,676
I won't eat the abalone.

626
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:55,851
Oh, my little girl.

627
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:58,854
When will you understand?

628
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:04,985
<i>The eldest daughter,</i>

Crying makes you hungry.

644

Eat while you cry.

645
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,217
What am I going to do now?

646
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:53,928
I don't know.

647
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:56,805
This morning…

648
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:01,644
my mom died, and now she's gone.

649
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:04,188
I know she's gone.

650
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:07,191
But the thing is…

651
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,823
…I miss her so much already.

652
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:19,537
I already miss her so much.

653
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,165
Oh, Mom!

654
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:26,210
Oh, Mom, I miss you so much.

655
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:31,549
Mom!

656
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:36,804
Mom!

657
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:46,647
Ae-sun, Sun-nam, Sun-bong.

658
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,441
All your names have a "sun" in them.

659
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:51,735
That makes you a family.

660
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:56,699
Just look at you. Even a stray dog
wouldn't wanna marry you.

661
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:00,327
You know,
it's yellowtail season right now.

662
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:03,330
I should be on a boat
trying to feed your younger siblings.

663
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:10,546
You'll just end up being a housekeeper
at your uncle's house.

664
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:13,716
Honestly, if you'll be one either way,

665
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:16,719
wouldn't you rather be a housekeeper
for your own siblings?

666
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:18,220
I won't be a housekeeper.

667
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:21,599
Mom told me not to live like that.

668
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:23,601
Ae-sun.

669
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:27,271
Your mom didn't want your siblings
to live as beggars on the street.

670
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:32,109
Just stay until yellowtail season is over.

671
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:34,028
Hmm?

672
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:37,072
Why don't you use
this good piece of land?

673
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,866
Are you just gonna let it rot?

674
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:53,672
<i>Just stay</i>
<i>until Sun-bong is potty-trained, hmm?</i>

675
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:12,524
<i>Just stay until Sun-nam</i>
<i>goes to elementary school. Okay?</i>

676
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:17,237
<i>Just you wait.</i>

677
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,657
<i>When the color</i>
<i>on your fingernails has faded,</i>

678
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,284
<i>you'll be through with grief</i>
<i>and ready to live.</i>

679
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:28,749
<i>I know you will.</i>

680
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:31,043
<i>The days will keep coming,</i>

681
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:33,712
<i>just as your fingernails keep growing.</i>

682
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:36,006
<i>Soon enough, you'll forget.</i>

683
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,967
Look here. I made this.
Do you like it?

684
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:43,305
Your family is bankrupt, isn't it?
Where do you get those fish every day?

685
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:53,982
Here you go.

686
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:57,361
Right there.

687
00:44:58,862 --> 00:44:59,863
Look at this.

688
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:04,368
Isn't it pretty?

689
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:10,874
I'm moving out.

POEMS OF YU CHI-HWAN

691
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:17,464
One last boat trip. Huh?

692
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:22,010
Just a few more deep-sea fishing trips
and I'll have a lifeline.

693
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:26,223
Other kids get tutoring and time to study.

694
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:29,601
I tend to the field and make food.
I wanna be first in the class too.

695
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:31,603
I just-- I just wanna…

696
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:35,983
Never mind.

697
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:41,363
Korean literature, right?

698
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:43,449
Isn't that what you wanna study?

699
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,534
No, poetry! Poetry!

700
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:48,412
Ae-sun, you said
you'd become a poet. Didn't you?

701
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:51,290
Poets sure are great.
Aren't they? Like these.

702
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:58,797
Yi Sang, Kim So-wol, Yun Dong-ju.
They all studied Korean literature.

703
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:01,425
"If you can't stand the sight of me,

704
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:02,634
when you leave,

705
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:05,804
tread lightly but firmly
on your way past."

706
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:08,390
Help me to pave the way,

707
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:12,936
and you'll be studying Korean literature
before you know it, hmm?

708
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:20,944
If you think about it, who paid for
all your schooling so far, Ae-sun?

709
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:22,571
I'm not just any stepfather.

710
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:26,742
In fact, I'm practically your real father
at this point. Huh?

711
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:29,620
Help me make money
and send you to that damn college.

712
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:31,538
Hmm.

713
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:34,291
Your uncle wouldn't have sent you
to college anyway.

714
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:37,795
If that household was gonna
take care of you, they would have--

715
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:40,631
On the mainland? A mainland school?

716
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,634
Mainland. College on the mainland.

717
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:45,761
You swear on your children's names?

718
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:48,972
I swear on my wife's name!

719
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:52,768
If I forgot the things you've done for us,
your mom would haunt me forever.

<i>When you're at your busiest</i>

723
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:06,782
<i>wearing long skirts can be cumbersome</i>

724

YANG GWAN-SIK

730
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:00,752
- Would you like one?
- No, I'm here to buy a cabbage.

731
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:03,714
I know. Would you like a cabbage?

732
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,842
You're selling these cabbages?

733
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:08,552
They're, uh, very good.

734
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:11,263
Her cabbages.

735
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:12,681
They're good.

736
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:17,311
Come on, everybody!

737
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,105
Fresh fish straight out of the ocean.

738
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:22,316
It doesn't get any fresher than this!

739
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:24,902
<i>Haenyeo</i>! <i>Haenyeo!</i>
<i>Haenyeo </i>caught these fish!

740
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:28,155
Get your sea squirt here.
Abalone, extra fresh!

741
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,615
I'll give you a deal.

742
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:32,993
Why worry about Gwang-rye's daughter?
She has Steelheart by her side.

743
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:39,875
My goodness.

744
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,277
Would you like a cabbage? They're good.

745
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,820
Would you like a cabbage?

746
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:12,157
<i>Gwan-sik sells</i>
<i>all of Ae-sun's cabbages for her.</i>

747
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,786
<i>In today's top trends, women are</i>
<i>fearlessly shortening skirt lengths.</i>

748
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:17,829
The cabbage is good.
Would you like one?

749
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:20,207
<i>In Myeong-dong, Seoul,</i>
<i>it's becoming common to see</i>

750
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:23,502
<i>women confidently walking around</i>
<i>with their thighs fully exposed.</i>

751
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:26,838
Well, you know,
it wouldn't be wrong to say that

752
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:29,299
Gwan-sik is raising Ae-sun by himself.

753
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:33,679
<i>Things have reached</i>
<i>the point where there are calls</i>

754
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:36,556
<i>to crack down on the trend</i>
<i>and reinstate long skirts.</i>

755
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,559
<i>They tell us to wear short clothes,</i>
<i>and now they're complaining about it?</i>

756
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,061
<i>In this broadcaster's opinion,</i>

757
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:44,356
<i>this is just a distraction from</i>

758
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:45,857
Would you like a cabbage?

759
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:49,736
The cabbage is good.
Everything over there is good.

760
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,030
They're all good to you,
I'm sure.

761
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:55,701
Gye-ok, you've got some explaining to do
about that son of yours, eh?

762
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:57,411
Oh, lucky me.

763
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:01,707
- So how much is the cabbage?
- One for 50 won. Three for 150.

764
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,333
Huh, that's not fair.

765
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:06,962
It's perfectly fair for three cabbages
to be 150 if one is 50.

766
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:09,381
{\an8}OH AE-SUN

767
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:10,799
{\an8}It's just math, you know.

768
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:13,927
Look, miss.
I didn't ask you how to buy my cabbages.

769
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,804
I want one, not three.

770
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,558
Well, lady, I don't make much
selling cabbages as it is,

771
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:20,934
and everyone wants a lower price.

772
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:23,270
I beat them to the punch this way.

773
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:25,605
Who wants to be punched
for doing their shopping? My gosh.

774
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:28,525
- All right.
- There he goes.

775
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:31,486
- One it is.
- Saves her yet again.

776
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:32,946
I gave birth to a dumbass.

777
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:36,033
I only want one, okay? That's it.

778
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:40,996
Sometimes, I wonder if that girl
has hands of her own.

779
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:42,247
I'm not forcing him.

780
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,583
He does it because he wants to.

781
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:46,043
No one's making me do a thing.

782
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,171
Oh God.

783
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:51,131
Should've raised a stray dog instead.

784
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:52,466
Better watch out.

785
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:55,260
Your grandma will kill you
if she catches you together again.

786
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:57,679
At that age,
they think they're invincible.

787
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:59,848
You think they're afraid of an old lady?

788
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,727
Chicken! My chicken!

789
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:04,936
Oh no.

790
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:10,567
Wait!

791
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:12,319
Out of my way!

792
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:13,278
Grandma!

793
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:14,362
Oh!

794
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:20,494
How many times have I told you
not to set up shop next to that girl?

795
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:22,662
Why do you keep coming
all the way out here?

796
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:25,665
Haven't you heard that daughters
take after their mothers? Huh?

797
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,417
I can't believe you let a girl

798
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:30,295
who has her mother's ghost following her
be near your baby.

799
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:32,047
Wake up!

800
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:33,507
That grandma needs Jesus.

801
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,467
I take after my dad, thank you very much!

802
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:37,177
Ah, you little brat, Ae-sun!

803
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,804
- Come back here, Ae-sun!
- Whoa, whoa!

804
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:40,806
- Damn you, girl!
- What did I do?

805
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:42,599
I told your grandson no!

806
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,936
- I said, "No, thank you." All right?
- Move aside.

807
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:49,147
- Just wait till I get my hands on you!
- Please, Mom. Let it go!

808
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:06,581
<i>But no matter how many times</i>
<i>I said "No, thank you,"</i>

809
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:09,042
<i>eventually, there would be no going back.</i>
