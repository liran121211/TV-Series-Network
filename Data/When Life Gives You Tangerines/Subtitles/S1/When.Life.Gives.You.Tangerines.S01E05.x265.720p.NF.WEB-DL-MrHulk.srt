00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,982
WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU TANGERINES

2
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:12,238
{\an8}Six out of ten boats in Dodong-ri
belong to the Bu family.

3
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,950
Eight out of ten people
have connections with them.

4
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,619
Who's going to hire Gwan-sik?

5
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,580
That guy is no good,

6
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:23,500
but his older brother,
the chief of the fishing co-op,

7
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,126
is acting up even more.

8
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:29,881
Island folk don't take kindly
to newcomers. He just got unlucky.

9
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,717
What the…

10
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,221
What happened?

11
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,681
They sent you away again?

12
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:40,767
Bad economy, apparently.

13
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,895
What, so people won't eat fish
'cause the economy is bad?

14
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,105
Go home!

15
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:46,773
Hey.

16
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:51,694
I hear they're building a road
around Hallasan.

17
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,947
Tell him to find a job there.

18
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,533
Money is money,
whether it's from the sea or manual labor.

19
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:01,496
Freshly picked by <i>haenyeo!</i>
Top-quality conch!

20
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:04,749
The conches are top-quality today.
So are the sea squirts.

21
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,295
I hear he's the first to arrive
every morning,

22
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,256
lining up early to get work.

23
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:15,426
Gwan-sik is always the first in line
among the workers.

24
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,262
It's so annoying.

25
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:20,390
Why does he have to be so diligent?

26
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,308
So, how's work for him?

27
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,227
Is he okay with working on land now?

28
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,064
He never says much.

29
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,899
Of course he doesn't like it.

30
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,944
A boatman will always yearn for the sea.

31
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:40,827
Oh dear.

32
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:43,580
My goodness. What now?

33
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,874
What's wrong with your arm?

34
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,544
I guess everything takes some skill.

35
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,423
Did they tell you not to come back?

36
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,301
Oh my.

37
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,890
Why did he fix a perfectly good roof?

38
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,819
Just get some rest, please.

39
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,072
<i>He was withering away.</i>

40
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:26,039
<i>A hard-working cow was withering away</i>
<i>because it couldn't work.</i>

41
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,961
Good gracious.
He already assembled them all.

42
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,756
I had three days to work on them.

43
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:40,887
<i>Mom said the leftover cabbages</i>
<i>she picked up in the field</i>

44
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:44,724
<i>looked less withered</i>
<i>than the back of Dad's head then.</i>

45
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,647
DODONG-RI VARIETY SHOP

46
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,881
Go back to sleep.
I've already started cooking the rice.

47
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,012
You can take it easy. Just take it easy.

48
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,600
Are you a cow?

49
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,979
You've been selling fish
since you were nine.

50
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,814
It's okay to take a break.

51
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,567
Just think of it as a school holiday.

52
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,320
I've never taken a break.

53
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:42,782
It feels strange.

54
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,368
Really strange.

55
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,580
Come on, just enjoy yourself.

56
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,874
You deserve some time off.

57
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,753
If I enjoy myself,
how will the four of us get by?

58
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:03,803
If I work for a day,
we'll make it through another day.

59
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,223
But to work a day…

60
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:10,852
It's just so unfair.

61
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,859
Why worry about starving?

62
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,946
I'll make the money if I need to.

63
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:31,331
The Literary Girl who couldn't even say,
"These cabbages are sweet"?

64
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,684
<i>Standing before the cruel rice jar,</i>

65
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:56,314
<i>Mom remembered her mother's smiling face.</i>

66
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,320
<i>She remembered how her mother</i>

67
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,449
<i>would put on a smile</i>
<i>just to sell another conch.</i>

68
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,286
So I was just wondering…

69
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:11,788
I mean…

70
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:14,248
Some rice--

71
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,876
I don't understand what you're saying.

72
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,213
Stop whining.

73
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,548
There are many worse off than you.

74
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,892
<i>The same way I've never forgotten</i>
<i>the look on her young face</i>

75
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,812
<i>as she struggled to smile through it.</i>

76
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,234
{\an8}Your dad gets ripped off wherever he goes.

77
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,903
{\an8}We saved 1,000 won per box.

78
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:48,199
I can't believe you asked for a discount.
You're such a mom.

79
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:51,577
Are you happy?

80
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,329
It's funny.

81
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:58,251
When I was younger, I couldn't even say,
"These cabbages are sweet."

82
00:06:58,334 --> 00:06:59,168
You? Seriously?

83
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,213
I was such a shy Literary Girl.

84
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:06,509
<i>I was so embarrassed to sell cabbages</i>
<i>in my school uniform</i>

85
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:11,013
that I'd bury my face in books like this.

86
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,974
So what happened to you?

87
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:19,272
Over time, I learned there are
worse things that truly hurt your pride,

88
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,900
like living in a one-bedroom house

89
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,653
and having to ignore the sound
of your family's stomachs

90
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,448
growling with hunger all night.

91
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,702
That was a true embarrassment.

92
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,083
Back then, everything was new to me.

93
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,463
<i>For some reason,</i>
<i>it all felt so humiliating and pathetic.</i>

94
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:48,301
<i>There were so many times</i>
<i>when I felt like I couldn't go on.</i>

95
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,636
Say something, will you?

96
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,763
What good will come
of you not speaking up?

97
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:56,392
Why bring your pride
when you're here to borrow money?

98
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,228
If you can't say a word,
why did you bother showing up?

99
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:02,773
What is it?

100
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,275
Is something bothering you?

101
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:05,902
Ae-sun,

102
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:08,946
you honor their ancestors now, not ours.

103
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,491
You should ask <i>his </i>family for help.

104
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:14,035
Why is Yang's wife causing a scene here?

105
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,829
I thought you were resourceful
like your mom,

106
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,165
but you're also as bad with words
as your dad was.

107
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:20,833
Is there no other way?

108
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,712
What if there isn't?
Is there even any land left to sell?

109
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:31,344
You must really be desperate to come here,
but we're drowning in debt ourselves!

110
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:42,230
Damn, Ae-sun.
Why can't you just be doing well?

111
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,316
Give her that ring if you want.

112
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:58,955
No rice in the jar to feed your kid,
and you can't bring yourself to speak?

113
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,003
You are still such a baby.

114
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:17,557
Honey.

115
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:19,892
Yes?

116
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:22,937
I just want to

117
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,816
grow old fast.

118
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,237
Why?

119
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:32,697
Just because.

120
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:37,243
I thought once everyone became adults,

121
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:41,414
they'd be able to carry hot bowls
with their bare hands, just like my mom.

122
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:47,169
I thought they'd become like Gyeong-ja,
who just eats without a worry,

123
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:50,464
even when creditors invade their home.

124
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,804
I thought that once you grew up…

125
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:02,310
your hands and heart
would naturally become calloused.

126
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,357
But everything's still too hot for me.

127
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:12,445
I get burned every day,

128
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:14,739
but it hurts every time.

129
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,701
Am I the only fool in the world?

130
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:19,827
Is everyone else

131
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,455
adulting just fine?

132
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:26,167
They all just pretend

133
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:32,006
to be adults
because people tell them they are adults.

134
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:40,014
I just want to grow old fast.

135
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,268
Maybe it's because

136
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:49,815
it's my first time
being a mom, a wife, and an adult.

137
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,069
I don't know why…

138
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,657
everything is so tough and overwhelming.

139
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:19,887
Hold me.

140
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:26,977
Pat my back.

141
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:43,369
<i>Sleep, sleep, rock to sleep</i>

142
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:48,749
<i>Sleep, sleep, rock to sleep</i>

143
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:55,131
<i>My baby sleeps well</i>

144
00:11:56,507 --> 00:12:01,846
<i>Sleep, sleep, rock to sleep</i>

145
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,474
<i>Sleep, sleep</i>…

146
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:06,809
Sun.

147
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:10,604
Ae-sun.

148
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:23,993
Did you lose sleep
because you didn't give me the ring?

149
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:35,337
Don't dig so deeply.

150
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,881
My husband's right there.

151
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,302
Don't even take it out.

152
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:44,805
I wouldn't be able to sleep if you gave us
the money you have stashed away.

153
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,391
- Buy a boat.
- Buy what?

154
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,352
Buy a boat, and don't say a word.

155
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,272
If anyone asks, say you won the lottery.

156
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,074
- Did you steal this?
- It's my money.

157
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:07,703
It's the money I made
from selling <i>gukbap </i>before the war.

158
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,791
You've been holding onto this
the entire time?

159
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:15,211
Jong-gu is a bottomless pit.
He would've gambled it all away.

160
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,756
So you hid it to give it to me?

161
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,010
Your mom threatened me.
She said this would make us even.

162
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:24,553
What?

163
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,391
Please, God, she must live on.

164
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,520
How could you take her away from her kids?

165
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,315
Mother.

166
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:41,570
Mother.

167
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,371
Could you please come with me?

168
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,249
I'm scared to go on my own.

169
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,543
FOREVER YOUNG STUDIO

170
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,968
Didn't I buy this for you
when you got married?

171
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:09,181
This is my best outfit.

172
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:16,480
I think it's because
we risk our lives at work

173
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,442
that we <i>haenyeo </i>believe
in so many superstitions.

174
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,611
They say when we take photos,

175
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,364
they will soon be used for our funerals.

176
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,452
I've had a coffin on my back
for my whole life,

177
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,497
but I still fear death,

178
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,708
and that's why
I never had my picture taken.

179
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:36,876
Look at me.

180
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:51,515
Your children will remember you
by this photo.

181
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,643
Pink will look great on you.

182
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,107
Let's take one for your funeral

183
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:02,401
and one for mine.

184
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,447
You need to live longer.

185
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:08,574
Join me later.

186
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,040
I've outlived my child

187
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,209
for far too long.

188
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,463
Even after losing my precious child,

189
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:26,592
my life just went on,
still eating three meals a day.

190
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,349
I'll make sure

191
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,559
I find your precious son.

192
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,482
I'll stay by his side in the afterlife

193
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,360
instead of finding a new husband.

194
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,781
If you see Han-gyu before I do…

195
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,242
tell him I'm sorry.

196
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,956
Tell him Mom is sorry.

197
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,167
Please tell him that.

198
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,169
Please…

199
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:13,597
I'll make sure he gets the message,

200
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,225
so please stay here

201
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,978
and look after Han-gyu's child.

202
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:21,772
Take care of Ae-sun

203
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,775
as you would've taken care of Han-gyu.

204
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:29,989
I thought so.

205
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:34,159
You brought me here to tell me that.

206
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,870
How else would you rest in peace?

207
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,500
She'll be an orphan

208
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,169
at just ten years old.

209
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,007
She just needs one person to rely on.

210
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,346
It's all my misfortune.

211
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,265
It's all my fault.

212
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,560
She's not without shame.

213
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,146
She won't bother you all the time.

214
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,898
If the day comes

215
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:08,694
when that shy girl comes looking
for her grandmother's help…

216
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,115
then her life must be unbearably hard…

217
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,327
so please help her out once.

218
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,500
She can weather even the worst

219
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,045
without saying a word.

220
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:30,883
But if she ever says…

221
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:35,012
"Grandma, I'm struggling,
and I need help…"

222
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:36,680
if ever she says that,

223
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,225
please save her
like you'd save your own son.

224
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,271
Just once. No more, no less.

225
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,066
Please help her just once.

226
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,861
Then everything will be even.

227
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,989
You'll have nothing to apologize for
to Ae-sun's father.

228
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:56,241
Gwang-rye,

229
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,368
Ae-sun is my grandchild.

230
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:01,789
Why worry about her
when you have a long journey ahead?

231
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,875
I just can't go yet.

232
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:07,461
I just can't.

233
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,130
Dear.

234
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,010
You can go in peace.

235
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,805
Leave your worries behind.

236
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:44,790
Here we go.

237
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,376
One, two, three.

238
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,310
Grandma.

239
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:10,774
Will I miss my mom less
when I become a grandmother?

240
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,361
Of course not.

241
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:19,575
The pain of losing a parent
cuts deeper as life goes on,

242
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:25,080
but the pain of losing a child is etched
in the deepest part of your heart.

243
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,458
When a parent dies,
you send them to heaven.

244
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,460
But when a child dies,

245
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,797
you keep them alive in here.

246
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:39,469
You can't let them go,
so you keep them alive in here.

247
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,309
So just take it quickly.

248
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,520
Giving it to you
is like giving it to my son.

249
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,114
I'll make you proud.

250
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,659
I'll make sure to live a good life.

251
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,292
We'll make you proud.

252
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,087
That's all I want.

253
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:30,729
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S FULL NETS

254
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,943
Our dear Captain Yang.

255
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:41,865
I hope every day is this good!

256
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:48,789
Captain Yang. This is great. I'm so happy.

257
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,461
There we are.

258
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:57,881
What a beautiful day!
This is the best day!

259
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:23,824
Dragon King,

260
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:27,160
May the ship not follow the fish,

261
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,329
but the fish follow the ship.

262
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,332
May its nets always be full!

263
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,168
May its nets always be full!

264
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,297
Please!

265
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:45,262
Bless us.

266
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,932
It's a boat as long as it floats.

267
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,351
Have some <i>makgeolli </i>at Captain Yang's!

268
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:52,644
You sure it will float?

269
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:56,106
Why is she making such a fuss?

270
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,654
Captain Yang!

271
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,072
Captain Yang!

272
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,116
Captain Yang!

273
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,160
Captain Yang!

274
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:14,333
The fortune teller said he was born
with a bounty of food in each hand.

275
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:18,337
Now he has set the Yangs' boat afloat
in the waters of Jeju!

276
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:26,928
<i>Captain Yang</i>

277
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,848
Captain Yang!

278
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,227
What are you looking at?

279
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,355
You can't hide the sky with your hand.

280
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,982
You found Jong-gu, right?
You're in touch with him?

281
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,609
You think I don't know you?

282
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:42,527
Go tell him

283
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:46,656
that I, Kim Chun-ok,
will report my own grandson for robbery.

284
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:49,659
Jong-gu is still the eldest grandson.

285
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:53,580
He will take care of your ancestral rites
and restore our family's fortune.

286
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:54,706
Ae-sun

287
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,126
is my eldest son's daughter.

288
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,586
<i>Captain Yang</i>

289
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:02,172
<i>How great! Way to go!</i>

290
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:05,550
The sole male heir of the family,
born to Kwon Gye-ok,

291
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:09,888
has set the Yangs' boat afloat
in the waters of Jeju!

292
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:16,603
It's actually the Ohs' boat,
not the Yangs'.

293
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:21,441
My grandmother bought me this boat.

294
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:26,947
I must have been the bounty of food
in Gwan-sik's fortune!

295
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:32,536
All right, you're such a blessing.

296
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,080
The most blessed of all, she is!

297
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:37,332
What should you do, then?

298
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,459
You should treat her like a crown!

299
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:43,839
She didn't even bring the silver spoon
you love so much,

300
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:48,051
but now she's given you a boat!

301
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:49,636
How wonderful!

302
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,681
What a devoted daughter-in-law!

303
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,725
The most devoted of all!

304
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,605
Who bought him a boat? Who?

305
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:04,401
You love her that much?

306
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:08,572
Father.

307
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:09,489
I think

308
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,784
she's the funniest person in the world.

309
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:18,039
Oh Ae-sun!

310
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:21,585
<i>There they stood that season,</i>
<i>like tall, green trees.</i>

311
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:26,840
<i>It was the start of a summer</i>
<i>that could never be forgotten.</i>

312
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,929
Mom, you're peeing.

313
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:34,931
Oh no.

314
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,893
- It's too early.
- Ae-sun.

315
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:42,230
Honey!

316
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,817
Honey!

317
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:53,950
Be careful!

318
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:16,348
See what happens when you laugh out loud?

319
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:18,558
This is what you get for cracking up!

320
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:22,229
<i>What did you do at my age?</i>
<i>What was your life like?</i>

321
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,189
<i>I don't know.</i>

322
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:27,275
<i>I think I was always pregnant.</i>

323
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:43,917
Gwan-sik made this, didn't he?
Wow, he's a master at it.

324
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,461
He's so good at making <i>jeon </i>now.

325
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,635
You like silver spoons.

326
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:57,722
You must be so happy to have some.

327
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:03,770
He made all these kinds of <i>jeon</i>
for his ancestors.

328
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:07,315
What a devoted grandson.
No one could be more devoted than he is.

329
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,903
Are you really not going to come
to the ancestral rites?

330
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:15,323
- I can't change his mind, can I?
- You can't?

331
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:20,870
I would love to go, but what can I do?
I should listen to my husband.

332
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:25,458
He uses his death stare to warn me
not to go anywhere near your house.

333
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:27,002
Oh, he's so scary.

334
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:32,757
Your daughter-in-law is a cut above mine.

335
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,968
If I'm the rabbit and you're the snake,

336
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:37,304
then Ae-sun is a baby tiger.

337
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:40,640
Come on, stop! I'm telling you.
You're not a rabbit either.

338
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,642
Not all born
in the Year of the Rabbit are.

339
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:45,520
Why aren't there years
of the raccoon, mole, or boar?

340
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:49,316
What? List a few more, why don't you?

341
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:55,447
Dad!

342
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,657
Dear me.

343
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:00,493
Hey. How was your day?

344
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:01,661
Give this to Mom.

345
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,666
What? What now?

346
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,627
Is that how you say hello?

347
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:12,797
Goodness. Why do you even have balls?

348
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:15,133
They just make
sleeping on your belly awkward.

349
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,720
Let's see.

350
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,556
Did you tell Ae-sun…

351
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:25,769
Did you make Ae-sun uncomfortable again?

352
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:28,313
What about Gye-ok, then?

353
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:30,649
Who's going to care if I'm uncomfortable?

354
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:31,900
Your mom likes me.

355
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:35,362
I gave birth to a son,
made you the captain,

356
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:36,905
and gave her silver spoons.

357
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,450
I gave her everything she wanted.

358
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,702
She couldn't hate me
even if she wanted to.

359
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:46,081
Wouldn't it be really strange
if she hated me?

360
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:52,045
Your daughter-in-law
is indeed a cut above mine.

361
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,923
I guess that means
my son is better than yours.

362
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:05,392
Why would he give them
all three of the octopuses?

363
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,353
What about our kids?

364
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,608
Are you going?

365
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:15,694
Are you going to your house?

366
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:18,697
Yes, we are going.

367
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:22,325
- We're moving to our house.
- All right.

368
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:24,411
Go, then.

369
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,329
I just wanted to say--

370
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,373
Go! Go on your way!

371
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,126
I really, really--

372
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,419
Stop talking.

373
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:34,671
Some things don't need to be said.

374
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,049
Thank you.

375
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,342
Crybaby mom!

376
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,469
Pack your bags!

377
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,847
Thank you for everything, sir.

378
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,308
Go wake your little ones.

379
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,894
We can't eat all of this by ourselves.

380
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,772
We have to cook pork to celebrate.

381
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,482
Why are we packing?

382
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,486
They say hard times never last,

383
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:02,240
but they lasted long enough for you,
living with your in-laws and then here,

384
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,117
didn't they?

385
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,620
Go live in your own house now.

386
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:39,986
You said you'd been coming here alone
since you were six.

387
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:45,992
You used to come over the hill
every chance you got.

388
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:56,044
Mom!

389
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:59,422
Mom!

390
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:02,592
My baby!

391
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,637
- You came over the hill alone again?
- Yeah!

392
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,139
Oh my goodness!

393
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:13,186
Mom!

394
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:14,521
Oh dear.

395
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,147
- Mom!
- Oh my, it's hot!

396
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,441
Goodness, it's hot!

397
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:20,318
It's so hot!

398
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:21,277
It's hot!

399
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:24,656
Mom, I made this. You like it?

400
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:27,158
It's beautiful!

401
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:30,161
My goodness, it's hot! Well done!

402
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,622
Well done, my baby.

403
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:33,790
Mom!

404
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:37,752
Mom! I got a perfect score!

405
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,046
My baby, it's freezing!

406
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:42,715
How did you come over the hill
in this cold weather?

407
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:46,010
SPELLING TEST

408
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:48,096
- A perfect score.
- A perfect score.

409
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,640
Well done. I'm so proud, my baby.

410
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:02,026
You said you loved this house
because it was your mom's.

411
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:09,826
You said you could smell her cooking
whenever you were here.

412
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:22,255
You said your mother kept diving
for abalones to buy this house.

413
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,301
We're not renting?

414
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:31,014
No, I bought it.

415
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:35,810
The landowner was from Busan,
so it was hard for him to manage anyway.

416
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,395
It's not a lease?

417
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:40,773
It's our home.

418
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,157
It's the first time I've had my own home.

419
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:51,910
Stupid home.

420
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:55,663
Even conches and crabs have their own.

421
00:31:56,789 --> 00:32:01,210
But I was always the only one
without a home.

422
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:05,006
My mom's house,

423
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:07,216
my uncle's house,

424
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:11,429
my stepdad's house,
and the one in Dodong-ri.

425
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,515
None of them were my home.

426
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,435
But this is actually…

427
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:19,062
It's really…

428
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,275
- Are you happy?
- Yes.

429
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,027
I'm happy.

430
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:27,987
Really.

431
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,448
I'm so happy.

432
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:49,676
I'll buy us a bigger house next time.

433
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:53,429
This already feels like a palace.

434
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,265
Now that it's my own,

435
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:59,852
it feels even more like a palace.

436
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:05,441
A little higher there.

437
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,444
<i>Summer somehow makes everything grow.</i>

438
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:09,362
Let me see.

439
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:12,448
<i>My diligent parents enjoyed</i>
<i>expanding our home so much</i>

440
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:17,078
<i>that they didn't even notice</i>
<i>the sweat on their brows.</i>

441
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,287
Oh my!

442
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:19,706
We should put one there too.

443
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,916
Yes, there. Put another one there.

444
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:26,337
Those are mother-of-pearls from Tongyeong.

445
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,131
It's brand-new, not secondhand.

446
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:30,383
It's brand-new, and it's all mine.

447
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:31,676
It's really mine!

448
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:36,931
Geum-myeong, do you want me
to pass it down to you later?

449
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,267
Do you want it or not? You want it?

450
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,435
Do you?

451
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:43,479
Should we take a picture?

452
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:46,774
It's not that big of a deal! Should we?

453
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,484
Look.

454
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:53,072
<i>Many years later, even after moving</i>
<i>to an apartment with a built-in closet,</i>

455
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:57,410
<i>Mom and Dad couldn't part</i>
<i>with the mother-of-pearl wardrobe.</i>

456
00:33:58,619 --> 00:33:59,746
Let's go.

457
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,627
<i>The shiny pearl wardrobe</i>

458
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:11,758
<i>reminded them</i>
<i>of their blazing summer days.</i>

459
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,145
The people who lived here before

460
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:09,273
didn't take care of the place
because it wasn't theirs.

461
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:13,820
They didn't even bother
to clean the hair out of the drain.

462
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,364
Were you that busy?

463
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,493
You never even appeared in my dream.

464
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:25,790
Did you come because I bought a house?

465
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,084
Because you're happy?

466
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,169
Because you're proud?

467
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,005
The woman next door bought a truck.

468
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:34,966
What?

469
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:38,261
Does he think being diligent at night
makes him a husband?

470
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:42,056
You're full-term. Why is he always out
on the boat catching squid?

471
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,643
Catching squid is how he bought the house.

472
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,687
He should've bought a car already.

473
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:53,442
Your neighbor
has a driver's license and a truck.

474
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,987
You came here to talk about our neighbor?

475
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,864
Are you jealous of her truck?

476
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:03,035
It was hard enough to buy a house.
Why all the fuss about a car?

477
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:08,166
If that persimmon tree reached
into our neighbor's house,

478
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,293
then that woman…

479
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:13,880
would eat all our persimmons.

480
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,841
You should make her pay for eating them.

481
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:21,554
Ae-sun.

482
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:25,474
That woman has a truck.

483
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,189
She has a truck.

484
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:45,912
Geum-myeong.

485
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:49,332
Geum-myeong.

486
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:54,503
Go see the next-door neighbor now and…

487
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:37,046
<i>Let's have two kids and raise them well,</i>
<i>regardless of gender.</i>

488
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:45,263
My daughter-in-law only had two children,
but yours has won all three medals.

489
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:49,100
The eldest is the gold medal
for being the breadwinner of this house.

490
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:51,978
And the second and third are both sons.

491
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:55,690
Your daughter-in-law
is indeed a cut above mine.

492
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:58,901
She's way above! Far above!

493
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:02,738
Didn't you say there was no son
in Ae-sun's fortune?

494
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:05,658
An ancestor appeared in a dream
before his birth,

495
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:08,244
so he will be a great blessing.

496
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:10,079
Just wait and see.

497
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:13,082
Gwan-sik will have full nets every day,

498
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:16,585
thanks to this boy's maternal grandmother.

499
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:19,380
You used to say
Ae-sun was bound to her mom's spirit.

500
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:20,965
Now she is an ancestor?

501
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:22,466
Even with any setbacks,

502
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:26,554
this little one
is destined to thrive in life.

503
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:30,057
You used to say
that Ae-sun's fortune had no blessings.

504
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,642
You're such a…

505
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,646
Such a what? A quack?

506
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,232
I guess you can be spot-on sometimes.

507
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:45,406
Full nets!

508
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:49,452
Gwan-sik's boat has full nets again!

509
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:51,078
Dong-myeong must be a blessing.

510
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,414
Fish flock to the boat
whenever it sets sail.

511
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:56,584
No, Ae-sun is the blessing.

512
00:38:56,667 --> 00:39:00,004
You see, I'm sure to make it
to a high position someday.

513
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,088
You're right!

514
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:06,594
<i>The people's representative,</i>
<i>the worker for the people.</i>

515
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:09,680
Wait, no one was against it.

516
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:11,974
Then it's basically unanimous.

517
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:13,768
<i>…for the presidential election.</i>

518
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:17,521
<i>President Park Chung-hee,</i>
<i>the sole candidate,</i>

519
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:20,649
<i>received 2,577 votes in favor</i>
<i>and one spoiled vote</i>

520
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:24,111
<i>and was reelected as the president.</i>

521
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,697
I recommend Oh Ae-sun for deputy chief.

522
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:27,782
Agreed!

523
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:28,741
I second that!

524
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:29,742
Me too!

525
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:32,286
Stop it, everybody.

526
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,830
I'm not interested in politics.

527
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,540
Who's Oh Ae-sun?

528
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,167
Gwang-rye's daughter.

529
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,794
If she's Gwang-rye's daughter…

530
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,880
…then let her do it!

531
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:46,634
She was the class vice president
in school as well.

532
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,135
Yes, vice president.

533
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:51,180
Vetoed. I reject your request.

534
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:53,140
The president picks his cabinet members.

535
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,393
Why are you deciding who to appoint?

536
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:58,896
Do you think a lion
would share a table with a hyena?

537
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:02,858
Someone's on a power trip,
even though no one else ran.

538
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:07,613
Even campaigns have
minimum requirements for candidacy.

539
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:12,535
Can a dog and cow run for office?
Please just eat one, will you?

540
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:13,661
But you have so many!

541
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:16,080
Maybe I should run for chief.

542
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:18,082
If a dog can run for it, why can't I?

543
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:24,255
What, you brat?

544
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:27,049
I'd rather not run for anything

545
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:31,303
than hold a title with "deputy" in it.

546
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:34,598
We didn't vote
because there was only one candidate,

547
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,642
but if there are more, we should vote!

548
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:38,144
- Vote!
- Vote!

549
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:39,937
What have I got to lose?

550
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,773
Let's just go head-to-head.

551
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:44,817
Gwang-rye's daughter

552
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,611
wants to go head-to-head with him!

553
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:48,779
Goddamn it!

554
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:50,656
A woman as the chief?

555
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,659
What's wrong? Are you scared?

556
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,163
Goddamn it!

557
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:00,583
Goddamn it! Seriously?

558
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,543
If you're not, let's vote.

559
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:04,086
Hey, you little brat.

560
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,924
Goddamn it! Hey!

561
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:12,219
Huh?

562
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,638
Just let her be the deputy chief.

563
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:17,308
Don't embarrass yourself
by letting her run and win.

564
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:25,191
I didn't know
she was this funny until today.

565
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,993
A SMALL BALL LAUNCHED BY AE-SUN

566
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:38,370
<i>Ae-sun launched a small ball into the sky,</i>

567
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:42,917
{\an8}<i>and Dodong-ri got</i>
<i>its first female deputy chief.</i>

568
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,085
Hey, come on.

569
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,795
Stop talking and look ahead.

570
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:48,130
Look ahead.

571
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,131
DEPUTY CHIEF

572
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,509
Squeeze in, everyone.

573
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:54,261
Shorter people to the front. Good.

574
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,639
Move to the side. Come on, move along.

575
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:57,598
One, two.

576
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:01,977
Say "three" before taking pictures.
Has no one ever told you?

577
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:05,189
All right. Everyone, look here.

578
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:06,774
One, two, three.

579
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:12,029
SOCIAL DANCE CLASS

580
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:16,951
Hurry up! Come out now.
Stop resisting. Just come quickly.

581
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:25,125
Come on! Take pictures!

582
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,919
- What?
- Why are you taking pictures?

583
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,296
Bring them all here.

584
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:32,841
Quick. Come sit down.

585
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:35,302
Gather them all like a pile of crap!
Get him!

586
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:39,515
Aren't there more of them? Out of my way.

587
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,231
Hey, is someone in there? Move aside.

588
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:51,652
Why would you go in there, you creep?

589
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:54,321
Creep?

590
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:57,491
The ladies' room is my jurisdiction.

591
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:03,247
Have you got a crush on me?
Why do you show up everywhere I go?

592
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:07,167
Just go elsewhere, okay?
Go to a different area.

593
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:11,171
What is it? You still think about me?

594
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:17,428
Got any regrets?

595
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:32,318
Hey, why are you pinching your nose?

596
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:35,070
Why would you do that while I'm talking?

597
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:42,536
Ma'am.

598
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:44,747
It's all over.

599
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:47,041
You're surrounded.

600
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:52,212
Is someone in there or not?

601
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,059
Those feet…

602
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,147
The hell with socializing.

603
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:12,941
When did we need dancing to socialize?

604
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:16,153
The New Community Movement
made people too comfortable.

605
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:17,655
All they want to do is party.

606
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:20,115
No one would have done this
during the war.

607
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,033
Go-go dancing?

608
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:22,785
Social dancing?

609
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:25,704
- We should send them to the 38th parallel.
- One, two.

610
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:29,291
Count to three before you take pictures!

611
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:40,886
Is this for real?

612
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:46,600
Seriously!

613
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:49,520
Why are you here? What do we do now?

614
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,732
What now?

615
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:58,445
Honestly.

616
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:07,204
How do I get them out?

617
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:09,456
Step aside.

618
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:18,841
Cover your face with your clothes.

619
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:21,009
You need to cover Hyeon-suk too!

620
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:24,805
Good idea.

621
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,849
<i>Right? Look at these women.</i>

622
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:29,768
<i>They eat well and have nothing to do,</i>
<i>so they dance around.</i>

623
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:30,978
I can't believe this.

624
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:34,231
You have to go through a famine
to wake up to reality.

625
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,567
Life must be good, right?

626
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:38,235
Too good!

627
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:40,362
Dance is a morally sound sport!

628
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,114
- Hey!
- Well done.

629
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:43,991
Morally sound, my foot!

630
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,786
If that's true, why are you covering
your face with your clothes?

631
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,747
Show your face and go to the Olympics.

632
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,248
Win a medal and be a patriot.

633
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:53,417
- Hyeon-suk, here.
- When hell freezes over!

634
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,461
- One, two, three!
- You hear me?

635
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:58,130
- One, two, three.
- Dance will never be a sport.

636
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:00,299
Stop taking pictures!

637
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:09,933
That woman is even carrying her child.

638
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,561
She must be fleeing from the war.

639
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,605
Take pictures of women like her!

640
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:16,523
- Go get her.
- Get her!

641
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:20,277
I'll get them!

642
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:27,326
Stop right there!

643
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:31,997
Why the hell
is she in my face all the time?

644
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:36,001
She's doing better than you, Chief.

645
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:41,381
All you know how to do
is count to three and take photos.

646
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:56,104
You'll be on the news
for taking your child to the dance hall.

647
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:58,148
Are you doing this because you're bored?

648
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:00,651
Have you got too much money to spend?

649
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:04,404
If I hadn't at least taken up jitterbug,
I would've gone mad.

650
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,783
I would've killed myself or someone else.

651
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:13,789
I feel rage inside when I'm stuck at home,

652
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:18,585
but when I just hold hands
and spin around, it all goes away.

653
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:22,381
So I can't help but go dancing.

654
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:28,971
So, even at home, Chief is--

655
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:31,014
He's still the same Shit-gil.

656
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:33,809
My nickname at home is "Goddamn it!"

657
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:34,810
Goddamn it!

658
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:37,729
He's always saying, "Goddamn it,"

659
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:42,109
so Hyeon-suk learned to say "Goddamn it"
before she could say "Dad."

660
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:44,695
Mom, you're Cinderella.

661
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:48,991
You're right.

662
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:52,536
Cinderella left her shoe behind
after dancing and ran away.

663
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,921
<i>So that makes your dad the prince.</i>

664
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:10,470
These are better.

665
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:13,765
You should wear something similar
to avoid his suspicion.

666
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:16,143
Who knows?

667
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:21,565
The prince of Dodong-ri might pick up
and bring a glass slipper.

668
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:26,486
By the way, does your husband
really buy your hairpins for you?

669
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,530
That's what everyone says.

670
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:32,534
They say your husband catches fish
just to buy you hairpins.

671
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:35,454
Seriously,

672
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:39,917
people in this small town
are too interested in others' heads.

673
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:44,087
Was that hairpin expensive?

674
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:45,881
Ae-sun,

675
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:48,717
you look more elegant than before.

676
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:51,136
Like a noble person.

677
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:54,890
I guess

678
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:58,602
people look the way they live.

679
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,027
Goddamn it!

680
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:12,157
Just leave if you can't handle it.

681
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,743
It's not like he's some great man
to look up to.

682
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:16,620
Why live with your insides boiling?

683
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:20,123
Is that why you turned him down?

684
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:21,583
Sorry?

685
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:25,087
You really don't have any regrets?

686
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:31,760
Have you got a crush on me?
Why do you show up everywhere I go?

687
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:35,847
Just go elsewhere, okay?
Go to a different area.

688
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:41,353
What is it? You still think about me?

689
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:44,064
Got any regrets?

690
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:47,526
- Goodbye.
- Thank you.

691
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:51,905
I have ears too, you know.
I know everything.

692
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:55,909
I found out
you and my husband had a history.

693
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:00,789
Come on, ma'am!

694
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:03,083
What history?

695
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:05,669
We just went on a blind date once.

696
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:08,088
One blind date when I was young.

697
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:13,719
Why just one date?
You should've spent more time with him.

698
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:17,806
Then you might have ended up
in this pile of poop.

699
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:26,189
Hyeon-suk, never step on a pile of poop.

700
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:31,278
You have to marry a man
like this lady's husband, okay?

701
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,949
Your handwriting is beautiful.

702
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:22,621
The Literary Girl should do the writing.

703
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:36,009
You want me on it?

704
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,053
The paint will dry fast.

705
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:41,848
It's bad luck for women to board the boat.

706
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:43,934
The Dragon King might overturn it,

707
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:45,310
and you won't make it back.

708
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:47,395
- I don't believe in that stuff.
- Hey!

709
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:48,980
Don't say that.

710
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:52,109
The Dragon King and the gods
are all petty and hold grudges.

711
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:53,485
I don't believe any of that.

712
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:57,280
You, Geum-myeong, Eun-myeong,
and Dong-myeong are my gods.

713
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:59,908
I'll survive a typhoon thanks to you four.

714
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:01,451
I won't die no matter what.

715
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,495
I'll always come back to you.

716
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:07,249
I'll make it home.

717
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:14,005
I know.

718
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,257
You're our Steelheart.

719
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:18,426
So get in.

720
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:20,679
You're my blessing, right?

721
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:24,099
You need to write it
for more fortune to come our way.

722
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,949
<i>Mom said she couldn't bring herself</i>
<i>to tell her daughter,</i>

723
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:45,287
<i>"It's bad luck for you to board the boat."</i>

724
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:52,127
<i>She didn't want to pass on</i>
<i>such a world to her daughter,</i>

725
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,631
<i>so Mom flipped the table first.</i>

726
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:45,555
I never really believed
in the Dragon King anyway.

727
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:47,140
I believe in myself!

728
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:50,018
Why is it bad luck
for my little girl to board the boat?

729
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:55,357
Do you even know
what's happening out here on land?

730
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:58,818
You don't even know
the New Community Movement, gramps.

731
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:01,738
Didn't you say the Dragon King
and the gods all hold grudges?

732
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:03,740
Eun-myeong, Dong-myeong. Come here.

733
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:05,909
I hold grudges too!

734
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:09,663
Do you even know anything
about the Anti-superstition Movement?

735
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,665
These days,

736
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:14,793
the president is arresting people
for shamanistic rituals.

737
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:16,795
If you get on my bad side,

738
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:20,257
I won't even offer you a bowl of rice
on the ritual day!

739
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:25,178
Why call me bad luck
when you feed off what I provide?

740
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:28,974
You're such a strange old man!

741
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:30,767
Spit at him. Spit.

742
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:38,566
<i>In the summer</i>
<i>that somehow makes everything grow,</i>

743
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:40,610
<i>my young parents grew up too.</i>

744
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:09,597
{\an8}GEUMEUNDONG

745
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:24,529
Now we have a house

746
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:26,823
and a boat.

747
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:29,826
This is crazy.

748
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:32,287
Are you happy?

749
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:34,289
Yeah.

750
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:35,999
I am happy.

751
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:40,170
I'm so happy.

752
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:52,098
<i>With their lives full of catches,</i>

753
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:57,062
<i>all they wanted was</i>
<i>for their blazing summer sunshine to last.</i>

754
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:01,941
<i>They had no idea back then</i>

755
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:04,903
<i>what else the summer could bring.</i>

756
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:09,866
FULL NETS

757
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:14,496
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S FULL NETS

758
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:04,624
"IN THE HOPE THAT OUR ECHOES
WILL FLOW AND FLOW UNTIL THEY REACH YOU."

759
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:14,384
