1
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:11,052
[person] You need to take that little
freak out of the contest, Mr. Mayor.

2
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:12,512
I mean it, eh?

3
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:15,682
If a rumor starts spreading
that one of those freak girls

4
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:18,226
is participating
in The King of the Machos,

5
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:21,396
San José de las Tunas' reputation
will be ruined, eh?

6
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:27,110
[scoffs] We're already the state's
last bastion of tradition and values.

7
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:28,278
[groans]

8
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,612
Dear ladies.

9
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,905
My dearest ladies.

10
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:36,494
Seriously, you have no reason
to worry about this sort of thing.

11
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,204
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

12
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:42,709
The boy-girl will be kicked out
of the contest in the blink of an eye.

13
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:43,835
You'll see.

14
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:47,630
Plus, I've heard that
not even his family wants this.

15
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,800
Don't lose sleep over this sort of thing.

16
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,595
- No, no, no, no.
- That's why Doloritas and I came

17
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:56,139
to ask you to take this matter
into your own hands.

18
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,099
That's where it gets a bit complicated.

19
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,643
My hands are... [groans] ...tied.

20
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:05,607
But, uh, are you still interested in the...

21
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,692
The abortion campaign?

22
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,153
- [aide] Antiabortion. Antiabortion.
- [Jerónimo] Anti.

23
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,780
[laughs] Antiabortion.

24
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:13,156
Slightly different, right?

25
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,533
Um, go with Juanito Valdés.

26
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,744
On top of serving you
some delicious coffee,

27
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:19,496
he'll give you the budget you need.

28
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,791
God bless you. You're a magnanimous man.

29
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:23,875
Ah.

30
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:27,253
- [kisses]
- Thank you so much, Mr. Mayor.

31
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,422
- Ladies, please come with me.
- Anything for your grace.

32
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,424
- [Dolores] Thanks.
- Will you come with me, ladies?

33
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,842
- Thanks so much.
- Let's go.

34
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,094
Thanks.

35
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:37,180
- Excuse me, Mr. Jerónimo.
- [chuckles] Hey.

36
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,099
- [giggling]
- This way, please.

37
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:42,060
Enough, <i>comadre</i>, control yourself, please.

38
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:47,065
THE KING OF THE MACHOS

39
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:49,984
{\an8}Give me more attitude.
Strike a different pose.

40
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:52,654
{\an8}- [Charly] Like this?
- [Antonia] No, no, no, don't smile.

41
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:55,865
{\an8}Keep that smile, and you won't get
more than three Insta followers.

42
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,368
{\an8}- [Charly scoffs]
- Look, put your hands on your belt

43
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,453
{\an8}like a ladies' man.

44
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,164
{\an8}Like, "Hey, girls, what do you say?"
Let's see it.

45
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,833
{\an8}Girls, what do you say?

46
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:08,294
{\an8}Charly, I'm positive that if I weren't
your community manager, you'd be sunk.

47
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,213
{\an8}- I didn't smile.
- Look.

48
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,299
{\an8}If you're not on social,
you can't be popular.

49
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:17,178
{\an8}And if you're not popular,
it's fucking hard to win this contest.

50
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,139
{\an8}So you gotta listen to me.

51
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,765
{\an8}Focus, let's see.

52
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:24,811
{\an8}- Loosen up. Relax. Shake it out.
- [laughs] Yes, relax, relax.

53
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:29,357
{\an8}Okay. Let's see, uh... Should I sit?

54
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,775
{\an8}[chuckles] Um...

55
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,153
{\an8}[shutter clicking]

56

{\an8}FIND YOUR DREAM JOB!

57
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,453
{\an8}- What are you doing, Son?
- Watching porn, Dad.

58
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,664
{\an8}- [moaning, panting on laptop]
- Great.

59
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,877
{\an8}Just save some energy
for tomorrow's tests, okay?

60
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,338
{\an8}I spoke with the foreman.

61
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:56,509
{\an8}After the contest, you'll work with him
so you can learn how to grow agaves.

62
00:02:57,093 --> 00:03:00,388
{\an8}Who says we can't start
our mescal brand, eh, Son?

63
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,223
{\an8}Yes, Dad. Thank you very much.

64
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,434
{\an8}[moaning continues]

65
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,560
{\an8}Thanks.

66
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,108
[moaning stops]

67
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:16,696
[Estelita] Oh, <i>comadre</i>,
I hope I'll have enough tomatoes

68
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:20,283
because with all this contest stuff,
the hostel is packed with guests.

69
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:23,411
Oh, that's great, <i>comadre</i>.
Hand me that. I'll help you cut.

70
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,163
Thanks.

71
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,791
- [sighs]
- [friend] Oh, <i>comadre</i>,

72
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:32,712
Berta from the tortilla shop told me
that the ladies from Tunas Frontline

73
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:35,924
made a huge fuss at the mayor's office.

74
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:37,008
Why's that?

75
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,260
They wanted him to take Charly
out of the contest.

76
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,724
You know what, <i>comadre</i>?
It's better if you don't tell me.

77
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:50,104
Hey, since when do you smoke?

78
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,774
Since my daughter became my son.

79
00:03:56,361 --> 00:04:00,448
I'm sure that my Carlota
is just confused, hmm?

80
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:05,328
You'll see. Soon this will blow over,
and she'll go back to the way she was.

81
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,788
I don't know, Estela.

82
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:09,249
It's not like a cold
that will go away in three days.

83
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,668
We love Charly a lot,

84
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,003
and Antonia says
that we have to support him.

85
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,005
It's not easy for him.

86
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,465
[coughs]

87
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,718
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to worry you.

88
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:25,014
Give me that. You're slower than a turtle.

89
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,350
[sighs]

90
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,435
And her name is Carlota.

THE KING OF THE MACHOS

92
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,782
- No. I think this one's the best, right?
- Yes. Yes.

93
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,701
- Definitely.
- Oh, natural-born talent.

94
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,661
- [Charly laughs]
- [Antonia gasps]

95
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,746
Charly, you're famous.

96
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,332
No.

97
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,334
No, no, no, what?

98
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,296
Juan, why don't you have a T-shirt
with Charly's face on it?

99
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:01,134
Who's going to want to buy a T-shirt
with that butch's face on it?

100
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:05,388
Well, good thing my face
isn't on these crappy shirts.

101
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,640
I'm sure the colors run
after the first wash.

102
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,310
Let's go.

103
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:16,357
Hey, don't be down about that.

104
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,235
Did you see how crappy
those shirts looked?

105
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,822
Plus, I'm going to make some awesome
ones that are better, Antonia-style.

106
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:25,283
- Charly's shirts are gonna be the best.
- [chuckles] Antonia,

107
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:29,537
T-shirts are the last thing I'm worried
about right now, believe me.

108
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:31,622
You're right.

109
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,834
Right now we have to focus
on the next test.

110
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,004
By the way, did you take
the antacids I gave you?

111
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,756
Who do you think I am?

112
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,591
- Ah...
- [laughs]

113
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,843
- You never let me down.
- No.

114
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:47,930
- Hey, should we take a picture?
- Sure. Sounds good.

115
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:56,022
WELCOME TO THE BIG EVENT
THE KING OF THE MACHOS

116
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,826
They say that this year they brought
chili peppers from the Yucatán.

117
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,912
They're not those super spicy
habaneros, are they?

118
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,039
- I'm fucking scared, dude.
- [clicks tongue]

119
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:15,208
Don't be a wuss.
How spicy could they be, dumbass?

120
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,043
Don't be fags. Stop whining.

121
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:19,212
- Fuck off.
- Don't mess with me, bro.

122
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,214
- Grow some balls.
- [Víctor] <i>Welcome, residents of Tunas,</i>

00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:25,343
<i>to the second stage
of The King of the Machos contest.</i>

124
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:30,431
In this stage's first test,
the macho hopefuls will have to eat

125
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:35,686
as many habanero chilies
as they can within 90 seconds.

126
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,939
I told you, dude.
They're habaneros, damn it.

127
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:39,357
Enough. Stop whining, asshole.

128
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,153

139
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:35,580
our volunteers have to wear protection,

140
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:41,002
since these chili peppers
are from an extra spicy variant

141
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:44,088
we deliberately brought in
from the Yucatán.

142
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:50,761
Merely touching these peppers
could irritate their skin and eyes.

143
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,807
Fucking hell, dude.

144
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,894

00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:48,337
Three, two! Last bite!

168
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,673
Dude, it's done! It's done!

169
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,466
- [horn blares]
- You did it!

170
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,887
Hands up, contestants!

171
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,849
Hands up, hands up.

172
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,228
Stand up, please. It's over.

173
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:09,358
Soon we'll count up the habanero stems,

174
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,945
and then we'll find out
who's been eliminated.

175
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,906
BIG EVENT
THE KING OF THE MACHOS

176
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,826
CHANGEROOMS - MEN

177
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,244
What are you doing here?

178
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:21,746
THE KING OF THE MACHOS

179
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:25,958
[clears throat] I snuck in to see
how endowed the machos are.

180
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:27,752
No secrets.

181
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,005
Oh, don't even think about
touching me with those hands.

182
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,590
Did you bring water?

183
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,508
- My mouth's on fire.
- No whining.

184
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:35,843
Be a man, damn it.

185
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:40,348
And you, get out of here.
This isn't a place for girls. Get out.

186
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,933
- Go on!
- Okay, okay. I'm leaving.

187
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,442
[laughs]

188
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:54,987
<i>Any self-respecting macho
will for sure have gastroenteritis.</i>

189
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:58,824
[chuckles] <i>Really soon we'll have
the names of the macho hopefuls</i>

190
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,410
<i>who, starting today, won't be anymore.</i>

191
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,663
<i>Won't be hopefuls, not machos.</i>

192
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,332
<i>And they are...</i> [hums]

193
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:09,794
<i>Ah, Gustavo and Roberto...</i>

194
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:12,880
<i>Thirteen gladiators remain, ready to be...</i>

195
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:13,964
You did it.

196
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,592
Ooh, he did it.

197
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,637
Well, come on, let's celebrate.

198
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:24,266
And look who we have here.

199
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,019
It's none other than Mr. Ponciano himself,
the barman at The Scorpion.

200
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:31,148
Tell us, Mr. Ponciano, what do you think
of this super spicy chili test?

201
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,275
What do you mean? It's unfair.

202
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:39,281
This... This competition is unfair because
Tejeda's daughter shouldn't be here.

203
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,118
<i>She's a broad. Of course she likes
sucking chili peppers.</i>

204
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,662
I can't fucking believe
what that asshole is saying.

205
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:47,540
Yeah, but it's not good for you
to get angry right now.

206
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:50,960
You need to be focused
for the next test. Focus.

207
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,462
<i>You can see that girl has a deep throat.</i>

208
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,048
<i>And she'll... She'll stick in anything
she can eat.</i> [laughs]

209
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,174
Look, you motherfuckers!

210
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,970
<i>You wish you could eat chili peppers
like my son!</i>

211
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,930
- [spectators laughing]
- Don't help me, Dad.

212
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:07,059
<i>You're such a dumbass. You can't save
yourself even in self-defense.</i> [laughs]

213
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:10,187
Mr. Mayor, I just had an epiphany.

214
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,440
Johnny, shh!

215
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,943
Don't start with your nonsense
right now, eh?

216
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,528
Juanito, I'm not in the mood.

217
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,156
- Listen to me.
- [sighs]

218
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,615
You need to support Charly.

219
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,788
On top of that,
what's with this bullshit, dude?

220
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:32,668
I mean, nobody wants the boy-girl
in this fucking town, dude.

221
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,756
Yes, sir, but think about it.

222
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,758
Whose support do you want?

223
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:41,177
Do you want it from Eduviges
and her gang of prudes?

224
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:44,096
Or from all the state's liberals
and progressives?

225
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,226
Okay, okay, okay, okay. What now? Explain.

226
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:54,190
The whole state thinks we're basically
a den of prudes and religion nuts.

227
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,858
If you want to become governor,

228
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,027
you need to detach yourself
from that reputation.

229
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,237
- Do you follow me?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

230
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:03,783
Okay. If you support Charly
to be King of the Machos,

231
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:10,206
you'll bring the trans, pro-inclusivity
and pro-gender communities along with you.

232
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:13,918
And that'll make
your popularity rise like bubbles.

233
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,379
Watch out because you'll lose
a lot of supporters in town,

234
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,715
but that's been calculated for.

235
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:24,303
However, your popularity across the state
will go through the roof.

236
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,848
[laughs]

237
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:31,268
No shit, fucking Juanito Valdés, eh?

238
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,729
You're a legit Rasputin,
fucking Johnny, ah?

239
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:40,236
Just today, I woke up
and I had a similar idea, right?

240
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:43,197
I mean, dude,
we're on the same wavelength.

241
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,158
I know, sir. I know.

242
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:48,702
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

243
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,509
Hello.

244
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:05,928
Hello.

245
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,346
How were those habaneros?

246
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,224
Terrible.

247
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,394
I just wanted to tell you
not to pay attention

248
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,729
to the idiotic things
the apes of this town are saying.

249
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,234
Thanks.

250
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,323
Good luck on the next test.

251
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:40,462
Now we'll move on to our next test.

252
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,884
Our young and brave contestants

253
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:48,596
will have to climb this pole
slathered in grease.

254
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:53,475
Whoever reaches the top
will get the highest score.

255
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,644
And those who don't, well, won't.

256
00:14:55,728 --> 00:15:00,357
But... But, they'll be judged
on how high they can go.

257
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,111
Let the next test begin.

258
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,242

00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,422
Come on, Charly!

[spectators whistling]

262
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,178
[Víctor] And he reached six meters.

263
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,138
[Víctor laughs]

264
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:40,439
And our primate-like contestant
easily climbs the first few meters.

265
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:41,649
Get down already!

266
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,984
[Víctor] But it wasn't easy for him at all

267
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:48,072
because he started like a monkey
and finished like a slippery trout.

268
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:52,201
Mario Ruíz, five meters. Not bad.

269
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,495

00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:17,267
He went up like an arrow
but fell splat like a sponge. [laughs]

276
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:20,354
But don't worry,
because he seems to be doing great.

277
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:23,107
And he reached six meters.

278
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,317
- [spectator] Six meters?
- [Víctor] Yes. Six meters.

[spectators chanting] He can't do it,

00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:36,513
he can't do it, he can't do it,
he can't do it, he can't do it.

294
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,982
What an odd way to hang onto the pole.

00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,651
<i>What on earth is he doing?</i>

296
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,785

Charly Tejeda has done it
in the least amount of time.

One minute and 28 seconds.

Bravo!

312
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:53,173
I'm rather afraid that this guy will need
cervical reconstructive surgery.

313
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,175
That was pure frog style! Frog style!

314
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,552
Frog style, indeed!

315
00:18:56,635 --> 00:19:00,931
Yes, Mr. Joel, but he did it. He did it.

316
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,433
[Joel] An awkward,
yet effective technique.

317
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:06,270
[Víctor] That's right. Yes. [laughs]

318
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,064
Oh, honey.

319
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,651
You don't know everything I saw Charly do.

320
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:16,155
It was seriously incredible.
I never would've imagined it.

321
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:20,367
You should come watch it next time.

322
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,496
My daughter hanging
from a pole like a monkey.

323
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,374
How could that be incredible? Hmm?

324
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,418
What's good about that?

325
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,170
It's such a stupid contest.

326
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:35,257
Seriously, Shorty, I don't know why
you support her in something that...

327
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,176
that you know is going to hurt her.

328
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,516
Look, honey.

329
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,061
I know this hasn't been easy for you,

330
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,148
but it's because you don't want to see it.

331
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,359
Your daughter Carlota doesn't exist.

332
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:57,321
His name is Charly.

333
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,865
Yes, Charly.

334
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,828
Are you really going to miss out
on your son because you're close-minded?

335
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,165
Hopefully you don't regret it.

336
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:11,877
Good night.

337
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:21,595
<i>I honestly don't know where you got
so good at riding the pole like that.</i>

338
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:23,639
[clicks tongue]
You're quite the pun master.

339
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:24,723
[chuckles]

340
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,394
<i>Why are you making that face?</i>

341
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,274
Uh... Well, I have
two pieces of news for you.

342
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,651
One's good and one's bad.

343
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,820
The good news is that people
are starting to find out about you,

344
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,073
even in the state capital.

345
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,241
[laughs]

346
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:46,536
And the bad news, well, yeah,

347
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,249
they made a meme of you and it went viral.

348
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,584
I'll send it to you.

349
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:54,586
{\an8}Sent!

350
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,879
[phone dings]

351
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:04,012
<i>You know what? I made it
to the next stage of the contest.</i>

352
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,431
<i>Nothing can make me feel bad right now.</i>

353
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,142
That's it, that's the right attitude.

354
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,312
[Antonia] <i>Charly?</i>

355
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:45,053
YOUR DAYS IN THE CONTEST
ARE NUMBERED CHARLOTA

356
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,139
Motherfuckers!

357
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,683
Fucking hell!
