[Inés] <i>Remember these biceps?</i>

00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:10,427
<i>They've all been winners
of "The King of the Machos" title,</i>

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,138
<i>the huge event that's turning
our lovely town upside down</i>

4
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:15,682
<i>and bringing visitors
from around the world</i>

5
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:18,309
<i>to find the most macho young man
in our community.</i>

6
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:20,478
<i>The King of the Machos starts tomorrow,</i>

7
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:23,106
<i>and these super machos have
a message for you.</i>

8
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:27,485
<i>Don't miss it!</i> [screaming]

9
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:28,570
[screams] <i>Ah!</i>

00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:33,575
THE KING OF THE MACHOS

11
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:36,369
{\an8}[Miriam] Saving the best for last. Ah!

12
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:37,620
{\an8}The last shall be first.

13
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,622
{\an8}Congratulations, boy.

14
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:40,790
{\an8}Mmm, mmm.

15
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,167
{\an8}So strong!

16
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,627
{\an8}[chuckles] Look, he's already got
calluses on his hand.

17
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:47,589
{\an8}Mr. Víctor, I'm eating.

18
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:49,090
{\an8}Ah.

19
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,429
{\an8}- [friend] Dad.
- Damn right, man.

20
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:59,100
{\an8}It's a chick.

21
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:07,567
{\an8}[chuckles] No fucking way, Carlota.
Girls can't join The King of the Machos.

22
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,612
{\an8}[scoffs] You'd better wait
to be the Queen of Spring.

23
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,785
{\an8}Hi. [chuckles]

24
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,162
{\an8}Sorry, what is this? [chuckles]

25
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,122
{\an8}My birth certificate.

26
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,582
{\an8}[Joel] Uh...

27
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,168
{\an8}I don't understand.

28
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:30,340
{\an8}The contest rules say that young people
who are 18 years old can sign up.

29
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,801
{\an8}It doesn't say
what their gender has to be.

30
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,636
{\an8}[laughing]

31
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,387
{\an8}- [laughs]
- [laughing] Oh, dear little thing.

32
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:41,643
{\an8}Ah, but... Oh, sweetie, the rules are
talking about... about the menfolk,

33
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:44,145
{\an8}and that's how it's been
since forever and ever.

34
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:48,233
{\an8}In that case, Mr. Víctor, there won't be
a problem, because I am a man.

35
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:56,449
And if that wasn't enough,
the contest rules are quite clear.

36
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:59,911
If you want to check, I can wait.

37
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,538
[Miriam] Uh, well... well,
we'll check, okay?

38
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,123
- Right?
- What's going on?

39
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:07,460
Uh, we just don't know what to do,
because there's no precedent

40
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,839
for anything like this in the entire
history of the contest. [chuckles]

41
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:13,883
No, well, here in the words
that Mr. Anastasio wrote,

42
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,803
there isn't anything at all that prevents
her from entering the contest. [chuckles]

43
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:19,264
[León] Come on, come on, enough.
Let her participate.

44
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:21,724
It will be fun having a mascot
in the contest.

45
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,977
- Mmm.
- Are you sure?

46
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,229
Yeah, Dad.

47
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:33,820
Good, but you should be clear.
It's at your own risk.

48
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:37,866
Don't come crying later like...
like what you are, a little girl.

49
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,077
Thanks for making
that clear, Mr. Castillo.

50
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,288
- Very apt.
- [Víctor] Do we agree?

51
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,790
Well, then, you're in. [laughs]

52
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:48,209
Dear girl, I mean... I mean, "dear boy."

53
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,544
- Congratulations, young...
- Man.

54
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:50,962
- Man!
- Man! Right. [chuckles]

55
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:52,714
Thanks.

56
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:55,008
So? Aren't you going to thank me?

57
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,052
Oh, yes. Thanks, León.

58
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,471
What would this town do without you?

59
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,931
Uh.

60
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,602
Ladies first, Miss.

61
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:06,853
Carlota.

62
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:08,938
Lady Carlota.

63
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,649
The queen of the machos.

64
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,401
[laughs] Yeah, yeah.

65
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:16,738
[Antonia chewing] <i>Mmm. Mmm.</i>

<i>Mrs. Zoila, please, you have to tell
everyone what's your secret.</i>

67
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,494
<i>Maybe it's the salsa, the cheese.</i>

68
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:26,706
<i>Mrs. Zoila,
these dishes aren't serving themselves.</i>

69
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:27,790
<i>Come on, back to work!</i>

70
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:33,588
[chuckling] One day you'll be sorry
you made these ridiculous videos.

71
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:36,925
We'll see if you say the same when you see
me living off of my royalties.

72
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,468
[Charly] Toña!

73
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:39,677
- What's with you?
- [chuckles]

74
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,304
- Why are you so happy?
- [door closes]

75
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,682
- I signed up for The King of the Machos.
- Yeah, right.

76
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,309
I don't believe you.

77
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,518
Oh, no?

78
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,357
What, Charly?

79
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,733
Are you crazy?

80
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:55,568
No. I have to win this contest, Toña.

81
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,863
And with the prize money,
you and I are going to study in the city.

82
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,658
[screaming, laughing]

83
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,993
THE SCORPION

84
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,453
- Seriously?
- [chuckles] Yes.

85
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:07,580
- Charly, you're the bomb.
- [chuckles]

86
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,291
And you know what? You're going
to win that contest. You'll win it.

87
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:14,462
We need a plan for diet, exercise,
because you're gonna get ripped.

88
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:19,175
And the most important, you're going
to start social media accounts.

89
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,386
Let's see your paper. Show it off.

90
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,012
Let them see.

91
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,056
Registration in The King of the Machos.

92
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,475
- [chuckles]
- Wow.

93
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,651
Shorty. Shorty, you're not going
to believe this.

94
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,653
At the market, Mrs. Chave told me

95
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:40,822
that Carlota signed up
for The King of the Machos.

96
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,532
Oh, honey, just ignore them.

97
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,908
They'll say anything.

98
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,411
No, she swore to me
that it was true. [sighs]

99
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:50,206
And the worst part is,
it seems they accepted her. [panting]

100
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,500
She'll be the death of me.

101
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,295
No, well, this time he crossed the line.

102
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:58,923
The way they are in this town,
they'll never forgive him.

103
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,469
Daughter! Son!

104
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,555
- She's a girl.
- Shh.

105
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:15,106
Is it true that... that you signed up for
that contest for The King of the Machos?

106
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,692
- Yes, Dad.
- [Alonso] Are you crazy?

107
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,695
In that contest,
they'll tear you to shreds.

108
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,823
I thought that you would support me
at least.

109
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,742
No, of course I support you.

110
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,203
But I support you in the things
that make you happy.

111
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:33,791
Registering in The King of the Machos
contest is like you're painting

112
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:37,712
a target on your back for the whole town
to attack you, Son.

113
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:38,796
I don't care.

114
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,967
Tomorrow, I'm going to show the entire
town that I can be more manly than anyone.

115
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,433
- Come on, 97. Good. Lower, lower.
- [León groaning]

Ninety-nine. Good, León, good. 100.

119
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,649
Good, dude. Good, good, good, good, good.

120
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,318
No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

121
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,612
It's not good for you to overdo it, dude.

122
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,322
You'll hurt yourself. Relax.

123
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,240
[panting] Fuck that.

124
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,910
This year, The King of the Machos
will be me, damn it.

125
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:11,204
[chuckles] Ooh, well, it's gonna be hard,

126
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,790
since you let
that Carlota sign up. [chuckles]

127
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,709
I don't care if she's a chick. I'll fuck
her up along with all the others.

128
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,169
Ah, yeah, I'd like to see that, dude.

129
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:20,004
- [chuckles]
- Watch me, asshole.

130
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,297
Where were you, Abi?

131
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:25,968
Leoncito. [chuckles]

132
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,512
No way, you smell like booze again.

133
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,223
Next time, I won't cover for you
with our parents, eh?

134
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,143
Relax, Leoncito.

135
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,104
And stop being such a girl.

136
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,522
[friend] Mmm. [chuckles]

137
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,483

138
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:42,735
Bye.

139
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,362
- Be careful, Abi.
- [Abi] One.

140
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,072
- [chuckling]
- What are you laughing at, stupid?

141

00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,390
and I want you to meet Charly.

170
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:40,102
A macho who's not too tough,
but he is very male, because just look

171
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,563
- at how he carries himself.
- [chuckles] Yeah.

172
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,400
Well, you can all follow his story
through my social media channels and his.

173
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,110
- Bye.
- Kisses.

174
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,195
[phone beeps]

175
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:54,158
Now can we go to the changerooms
or will you keep doing your thing?

176
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,536
Changerooms? Why,
what am I going to do there?

177
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,663
Like, am I going to enjoy the eye candy?

178
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,373
WELCOME TO THE BIG EVENT
THE KING OF THE MACHOS

179
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:03,584
[chuckles] You're my coach. Remember?

180
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,503
Right? [chuckles]

181
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,588
Obviously. Yes.

182
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:11,509
[gasps] Because as a trans man
with a female coach

183
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:16,931
in a changeroom full of machos, I think
we'll be disqualified right off the bat.

184
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:22,728
Let them disqualify us,
but not for arriving late. Let's go. Now.

185
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,064
We're going to win! Look! Oh.
Let's take a photo with him now.

186
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,440
- One photo.
- No, no. Let's go already.

187
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,401
Let's go. Let's go.

188
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:30,528
- Don't take off your mascot costume!
- [Charly] Please.

189
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,614
[applause]

190
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,744
<i>We're here for the inauguration
of the most anticipated event of the year.</i>

191
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,913
<i>Today, The King of the Machos begins.</i>

192
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:44,166
<i>And we're here with the crème de la crème
of Tunas society.</i>

193
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:48,045
You're going to show all those fags
who the Castillos really are.

194
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,213
Yes, sir.

195
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:52,091
[scoffs] Damn, look at that!

196
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,636
Two chicks in a men's changeroom.

197
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,639
Don't worry, Dad,
they won't make it past today. Relax.

198
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,600
You look so pretty, Toña.

199
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,560
She's pretty, she's looking really good.

200
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:03,978
Yes or no, Toña?

201
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:05,646
What?

202
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:09,358
Nothing.

203
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:13,654
[crowd cheering]

204
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,913
[dignitary] It's very exciting being able
to be here together,

205
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,875
to discover
who is the most macho this year.

206
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:27,793
[dignitary 2] Bravo!

207
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,593
These 20 machos will have the opportunity
to prove they have the three "G's"

208
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:38,054
of a great Mexican macho.

209
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,806
Gorgeous, gallant,

210
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,268
and a gigantic drive to succeed!

211
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:51,651
This year, in addition to
the traditional check for 50,000 pesos...

212
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,778
Drumroll, please.

213
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,029
[drumroll plays]

214
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:56,614
We have

215
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:57,948
a tractor!

216
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,867
BIG EVENT
THE KING OF THE MACHOS

217
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,662
Secondhand, but works like new!

218
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:11,003
Let's give a big welcome
to our 20 macho participants.

219
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,839
[Miriam] A big round of applause!

220
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:17,635
{\an8}THE KING OF THE MACHOS

221
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:37,863
[crowd boos]

222
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,241
WINNER - LAST ELIMINATED

223
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,078
[booing continues]

224
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,838
[contestants] Wow, ow, ow!

225
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,548
[Miriam chuckles]

226
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:59,218
Boys, all I'm asking is that you please,

227
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:05,307
at all times,
express the values of a good macho.

228
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:09,770
And without further ado,
people of San Pedro de...

229
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,565
- José. José.
- [Miriam] San José. San José.

230
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,734
[chuckling] Just kidding, just kidding.

231
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,778
People of San José de las Tunas,

232
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:24,243
I declare open The King of the Machos
contest! May the most macho win!

233
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:37,965
We'll begin with the first test,
where we'll measure the size...

234
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,926
the size of...

235
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,595
of their guns.

236
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,557
Show us your big guns, boys!

237
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,601
THE BIG GUNS TEST

238
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,002
Oh.

239
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,922
[crowd boos]

240
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,090
Go home!

241
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,512
[Miriam] Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

242
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:29,558
{\an8}LIVE NEWS
THE BIG GUNS TEST BEGINS

243
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:34,563
What do you think of Charly's guns,
Mrs. Zoila?

244
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,524
That's not even a toy gun.

245
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,820
{\an8}[chuckles]

246
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,030
{\an8}- <i>That's not a gun, it's a bomb.</i>
- [Miriam chuckles]

247
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,991
What about León? Can he win it?

248
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:55,125
[Miriam] In a moment,
we'll have the results.

249
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,877
[Víctor] Strenuous. Bah.

250
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,713
[judges murmuring]

251
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,173
- Are you sure?
- Ah.

252
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,716
- Ah.
- No. No, no.

253
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,801
It's no surprise.

254
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:04,885
Ouch.

255
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:08,430
[Miriam] We have the result.

256
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:12,142
[Víctor] My dear macho hopefuls,

257
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:19,692
we've now got
our first disqualified contestant.

258
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:20,985
[crowd gasps]

259
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,160
What's happening, kid? How are you doing?

260
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,538
I just have to finish drying this,
and that's all.

261
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:35,124
{\an8}[Víctor] <i>And the disqualified one is, mmm...</i>

262
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,334
{\an8}HOPEFULS WAIT FOR NAME
OF FIRST DISQUALIFIED CONTESTANT

263
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,419
{\an8}<i>Mmm. Is...</i>

264
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:41,213
{\an8}[Ponciano] That party didn't last long
for Carlota, eh?

265
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,466
That's what she gets for including herself
with real machos.

266
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,473
{\an8}- <i>Iván!</i>
- <i>Oh! Oh.</i>

267
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,393
{\an8}- <i>They're disqualifying you. Yep.</i>
- <i>No, wait...</i>

268
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:55,519
{\an8}<i>Take him away.</i>

269
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:00,107
{\an8}[Miriam] <i>Give him a hand to say goodbye.</i>

270
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,942
- What?
- <i>Oh, keep trying.</i>

271
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:05,112
There are a lot...
a lot of flies that got in just now.

272
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,866
Fucking broad.
I'm sure that in the next one,

273
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:11,577
- they'll kick her out. Listen to me.
- [Víctor] <i>He didn't like that, I think.</i>

274
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,079
- [Miriam] <i>I agree.</i>
- They'll kick her out for sure.

275
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:17,499
[Víctor] Dear people of Tunas.

276
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,377
Hey, move, man. You're blocking me.

277
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:23,505
Now, let's move on to the second test.

278
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:29,678
As you all know, dear people,
this test will be won by the macho

279
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:35,351
who manages to change a tire in the least
amount of time and using basic tools.

280
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:41,231
Besides, there will be an additional
inconvenience that he'll have to overcome.

281
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:47,071
One of our beautiful, lovely,
and gorgeous Tunas girls

282
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:54,119
will get on the hood of the vehicle to
dance, during the test, a Tejano cumbia.

283
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,664
Careful, boys,

284
00:15:56,747 --> 00:16:02,044
because seeing so much flesh
may cause the car to fall on you.

285
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,128
[crowd laughs]

286
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:08,592
Well, let's start with the three machos
who are in the lead.

287
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,053
Let's get them started
with a big round of applause.

288
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,388
[applause]

289
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,723
Contestants,

290
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,476
are you ready?

291
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,854
Start the music.

292
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,315
[cumbia music playing]

293
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,486
THE TIRE TEST

294
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,754
[Antonia] But you do know how
to change a tire, right?

295
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,841
Mmm, yeah, but not with
someone tap-dancing on the hood.

296
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,732
I've got it. That's it.

297
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,192
It's a matter of rhythm,

298
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:10,070
which is exactly what León is not doing.

299
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:13,032
He wants to solve everything
with force because he's so macho.

300
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,199
[Charly] Uh-huh.

301
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:17,786
You have to solve it
with sensitivity and rhythm.

302
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,124
[Charly] Mmm.

303
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,625
Mmm, look at her.

304
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,597
[groans] Help! Help!

305
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,391
- Help! Help!
- Hurry, damn it!

306
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,812
[Joel] Oh.

307
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,023
So much squealing because
something fell on his foot.

308
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,734
Man, what do we say here to crybabies?

309
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:51,737
[all] That's not macho.

310
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:56,700
[chanting] That's not macho!

311
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,828
That's not macho!

312
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,663
[horn blares]

313
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:14,009
[Víctor] And he finishes
with three minutes 55 seconds.

314
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,890
[friend] Don't stop now! Come on, León!

315
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,184
Come on, León, come on!

316
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,269
[crowd cheers]

317
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,438
[crowd chanting] León! León! León!

318
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:31,360
I can't live in this town full of cavemen.

319
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:33,570
Enough.

320
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:37,407
Baby, baby, baby. Just a little longer,
just a little longer.

321
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,451
But we've got to hold on for now, eh?

322
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,704
No, I just can't handle a dry climate,
I mean it's true.

323
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,498
[both chuckling]

324
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,291
Smile and wave on this side meanwhile.

325
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,876
Yes. Smile.

326
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,420
Other side.

327
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:53,590
Now, laugh.

328
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,135
[both laugh]

329
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,387
Hey, speaking of elections,

330
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,265
we need to take a selfie
for your followers.

331
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:02,933
- Take it from that side.
- Yes.

332
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:04,393
Because there's a shadow on me.

333
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,228
Wait. Let them see the ring.

334
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,065
[shutter clicks]

335
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,862
Oh, I love it.

336
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,114
Andy has the same ring as me!

337
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:19,032
- That's cool.
- Oh, no, baby. Wow.

338
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,285
- Oh, no. This...
- Hey.

339
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:24,288
Next year, you know who to vote for, right?

340
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,082
JERÓNIMO
FOR GOVERNOR!

341
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,793
[chuckling]

342
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,590
- Babe.
- [horn blares]

343
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,300
Contestants,

344
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,385
are you ready?

345
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:43,390
Ready, set, go!

346
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,475
[cumbia music playing]

347
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:16,048
Bravo, Charly, go for it!

348
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,424
[crowd booing]

349
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:20,761
[Antonia] Charly, Charly, Charly!

350
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:38,403
Charly, Charly, Charly, Charly, Charly!

351
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,447
Charly, you can do it!

352
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,033
You can do it, Charly, you can do it.

353
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:44,117
Concentrate.

354
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,497
- [groans]
- [crowd cheering]

355
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,124
[Joel] Ah! Enough, Santiago.

356
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,293
Stop complaining,
you look like a little girl.

357
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,462
Besides, a blessing has befallen
you. [chuckles]

358
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,839
What do we say here to whiners?

359
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,175
- That's not macho! That's not macho!
- [crowd] That's not macho!

360
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,302
That's not macho!

361
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:05,013
[crowd, Miriam] That's not macho!

362
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,723
That's not macho!

363
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,684
That's not macho!

364
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,144
That's not macho!

365
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,938
That's not macho!

366
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:15,190
That's not macho!

367
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,693
That's not macho!

368
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,696
- [horn blares]
- [Víctor] And first place for this group,

369
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:24,825
with three minutes and 0.9 seconds is

370
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,787
- Charly Tejeda! [laughs]
- [crowd booing]

371
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,706
Now we'll see how he does
in the general competition.

372
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,333
You won! Way to go!

373
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,419
[crowd booing] Cheater!

374
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,590
[Antonia] Charly, Charly!

375
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:41,758
Charly!

376
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,260
In your face!

377
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:44,553
He won in your face!

378
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,179
Bravo!

379
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:02,446
Honestly, I can't believe
that a girl beat you changing a tire.

380
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:07,367
I want you in first place
for the rest of the contest.

381
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:22,591
Well, we're down one contestant
for the next test. [chuckles]

382
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:24,926
- Are the rest of you ready?
- Let's go!

383
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:29,765
[Miriam] For the next test,
the contestants will have to down

384
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,434
five shots of tequila

385
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:38,148
to then pass an exhausting physical test.

386
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,567
Come on, machos.

387
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,402
- Start your engines!
- [horn blares]

388
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:45,155
THE WALL OF TEQUILA TEST

389
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:47,199
THE KING OF THE MACHOS - 001
THE KING OF THE MACHOS - 003

390
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,172
- [crowd boos]
- Look, that one already bit the dust.

391
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:04,925
He landed
like an overripe tomato. [laughs]

392
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:10,430
[Antonia cheering] Let's go!
That's it, harder! Let's go!

393
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:11,515
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

394
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:14,226
{\an8}GO MARIO!

395
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,355
THE KING OF THE MACHOS - 020

396
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,525
- [crowd] Ah!
- He's turned the tire into a compost bin.

397
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:06,945
[Miriam] Ew, that's gross! [chuckles]

398
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:12,451
It's the final of the Tequila Circuit,
dear viewers,

399
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:15,412
and the young macho hopefuls are running
to make their dreams come true.

400
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:18,748
In first place, comes León Castillo,

401
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:21,877
great-grandson of the legendary
Anastasio Castillo.

402
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,961
Hey, what's this?

403
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:25,589
There's a scrum happening on the field
of The King of the Machos.

404
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,507
There's violence.
They're like spider monkeys!

405
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:28,633
Like spider monkeys.

406
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:31,303
There's violence, dear viewers,
the field here at The King

407
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:33,138
of the Machos has become a boxing ring.

408
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:35,056
And here comes Charly Tejeda,
here comes Esteban,

409
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,641
here comes Telésforo, here comes Jaime.

410
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:39,269
Good, good, good, my Charly! My Charly!

411
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:40,687
[horn blares]

412
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:43,982
[Inés] Trying to reach their dreams,
they want to arrive at the finish line.

413
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,275
[screams]

414
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:48,487
Charly Tejeda is going to cross the finish
line, dear viewers, but isn't crossing,

415
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,988
- isn't crossing.
- What are you doing?

416
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,991
- Help me!
- Going back. Jaime, Jimmy is stuck.

417
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:54,159
He's turning purple.

418
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:57,329
He's being strangled by the climbing net.

419
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:59,498
He's helping him
instead of crossing the finish line.

420
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:00,707
What are you doing, Charly?

421
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,209
[Miriam] Leave him!
Keep going, keep going!

422
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:05,045
- [Joel] We'll have to disqualify him.
- [Víctor] Yes, of course. Ha.

423
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:06,880
[crowd booing]

424
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,051
Whenever you're ready, Doc.

425
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:16,056
Uh, uh, uh!

426
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:17,474
Good, dude, good! Uh, uh, uh!

427
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:21,186
Honey, congratulations. [sighs]

428
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:28,193
Not bad.

429
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,237
Not bad.

430
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,159
Are you okay?

431
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:37,410
I'm okay.

432
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:40,038
Hey, but, why did you do that?

433
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,499
I'm sure you're disqualified.

434
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:44,209
Whatever. How could I not help him?

435
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:47,128
[Víctor] Charly did not finish the test,
so he should leave this contest.

436
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,422
But he stopped to help a comrade.

437
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:52,592
- [sighs]
- That's an example of solidarity, eh?

438
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,386
{\an8}PREVIOUS WINNER - MARIO
LAST ELIMINATED - FERNANDO

439
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:56,388
Are you sure you don't want
to wait to hear the results?

440
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:58,181
What for? Come on, let's go home.

441
00:25:58,765 --> 00:25:59,766
[Santiago] Charly!

442
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:07,941
You did good. [chuckles]

443
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,361
[crowd cheering]

444
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:22,998
I told you.

445
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:27,460
That is an example of manliness.

446
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:30,797
Thanks.

447
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,174
So?

448
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,303
- Who are you?
- Okay, okay, okay. Let's go. Let's go.

449
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:39,139
[Víctor] Dear people of Tunas,

450
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:43,018
the honorable jury of this contest,
I mean, us...

451
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:49,107
we have decided
to allow contestant Charly Tejeda

452
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:53,194
to move on to the next stage.

453
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:59,826
Due to the heroism displayed
by helping a fallen comrade.

454
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:04,873
Just one day of competition
and 15 comrades,

455
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:09,127
macho hopefuls,
will continue in the contest.

456
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,380
- See you tomorrow, people of Tunas.
- Charly.

457
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,966
Charly, you passed.

458
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,552
- Charly passed! Charly, you passed!
- I passed!

459
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,221
You passed! [laughs]

460
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,931
How did you do it?

461
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,099
Come on, let's take a photo.

462
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,601
Yeah, yeah, okay.

463
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:26,436
- [chuckles]
- [shutter clicks]

464
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,068
I'm not a hero.

465
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,903
Now it seems that you're a hero
who drinks tequila,

466
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,155
takes on challenges, jumps, hops.

467
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:39,240
- Sick women!
- Go back to your town and make tortillas!

468
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,951
- [groans]
- [attacker laughs] Right on target.

469
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,953
[Charly] Come here, fucking dicks!

470
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:46,956
[laughs] That's awesome.

competition for The King of the Machos.</i>

472
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:56,883
{\an8}<i>And I think the biggest surprise
of the day</i>

473
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:59,886
{\an8}<i>was young Charly Tejeda,
our first trans contestant.</i>

474
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:01,388
[chuckles] That's my son. That's my son!

475
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:04,432
[Inés] <i>And he had the decency
to help a fallen contestant,</i>

476
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:08,061
<i>which won him the right
to keep participating in the contest.</i>

477
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:11,940
<i>This stirred up hate in most
of the people in the town, while...</i>

478
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,900
Now everybody will be talking about us.

479
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:17,237
This isn't going to end well, Alonso.
I know what I'm talking about.

480
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,905
I just know it, I'm her mother.

481
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:19,989
Okay, honey, relax.

482
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:23,243
[Inés] <i>How far will Charly Tejeda get
in this competition?</i>

483
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:25,662
Son? Son, come.

484
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:29,457
Your mom and I just saw you on TV.
You... You did really great, Son, truly.

485
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,709
I'm so pro...

486
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:33,670
I mean, not "I," we're so proud of you.

487
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:35,046
She stinks.

488
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:40,635
[Alonso] Charly. Charly!

489
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,930
I'm telling you,
this isn't going to end well, Alonso.

490
