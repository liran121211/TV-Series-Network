1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,419
Mr. Mayor,

2
00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:06,172
we keep dropping in the polls.

3
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:09,217
I told you that it was a very bad idea
to stop supporting Charly.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,762
We've lost many points
from decided voters around the state.

5
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,473
[shushes] Look... [chuckles]
What's wrong, little one?

6
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:18,351
We said we weren't going to
talk about that anymore.

7
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,770
No need to cry over spilled honey.

8
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,106
Cry over spilled milk, sir.

9
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,317
And please, you need to
start supporting that kid again.

10
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,486
That's not possible, that's not possible.

11
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:33,283
But, you know what? What I do need
is for all of the assistants...

12
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:39,289
I don't know, give them, uh,
a plot of land, a little truck,

13
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:42,208
but please, make sure
they're all happy and quiet.

14
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:44,544
- [laughs]
- Why?

15
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:48,423
[scoffs]

16
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,760
Why?

17
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,182
THE KING OF THE MACHOS

18
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,893
{\an8}- <i>Toma de referee</i>. Good.
- [Charly whispers] Legs.

19
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:03,146
{\an8}- [Ramón] Legs planted. Legs planted.
- [Charly] Ah!

20
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:08,443
{\an8}That's judo, you use your own elasticity
to break free from your opponent.

21
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:11,196
{\an8}- Come here, I'll show you another one.
- Yeah.

22
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,865
{\an8}You come here. This one's very simple.

23
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:17,368
{\an8}Grab your opponent's arm,
you turn, and you're in control.

24
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,996
{\an8}Ah, let go! I... I got it.

25
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:23,958
{\an8}This is useless.
I'm much weaker than León.

26
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:27,420
{\an8}You think that I can get him
into a hold like this? There's no way.

27
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:31,508
{\an8}Well, yeah.
Maybe León is stronger than you,

28
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,469
{\an8}but you're faster, bro.

29
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,429
{\an8}That makes you unpredictable.

30
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:39,974
{\an8}- You have to change your attitude now. Eh?
- [sighs] Yeah.

31
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:43,228
{\an8}I mean, you can't go into the ring
like that, all defeated.

32
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,729
{\an8}Obviously you'll lose.

33
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,732
{\an8}Come on, show some attitude!
Good, good, good, good!

34
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,485
{\an8}- Okay. Okay. Yeah.
- Come on, you try it. Ready?

35
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:54,614
{\an8}- Like that. Like that. Like that.
- You've got it. That's it, that's it.

36
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:57,158
{\an8}- Hell yeah, that's it.
- Yeah? Hey.

37
00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:01,246
{\an8}Look, when you're facing León
and he tries to pull,

38
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:04,499
{\an8}you're going to use his own strength
against him to take control.

39
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,042
{\an8}I'll explain. Come here.

40
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,002
{\an8}Ready? Pull me, but pull me hard.

41
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:11,131
{\an8}There you go. Enough.
And he can't get out, eh?

42
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,383
{\an8}- Okay.
- Good. Try it.

43
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,384
{\an8}Yeah.

44
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,387
{\an8}- Face-to-face, eyes...
- Mm-hmm.

45
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,472
[phone ringing]

46
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,018
I have to take this.

47
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,397
Abi?

48
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,540
[lock clicks]

49
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,600
[chuckles]

50
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,394
[sighs]

51
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,314
Are you okay?

52
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,816
My parents found out about us.

53
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,652
Your dad hit you?

54
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:19,157
Let's just say that he's not
the only Castillo with a heavy hand.

55
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:22,410
Your mom?

56
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:27,373
[Abi] And from what I can tell,
it was no picnic for you either.

57
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:32,253
It was my dad who spoke
with Jacobo and those guys,

58
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:35,798
and with the mayor,
so they'd shut down your parents' hostel.

59
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,303
And I thought that León was
the one behind it.

60
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:41,888
No.

61
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:46,726
León lives with my dad's foot on his neck,
but he's not as rough as he seems.

62
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:52,398
Your brother is hiding
a lot of things, isn't he?

63
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,400
[chuckles]

64
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:05,995
What's wrong?

65
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:16,339
Abi, our relationship
has only brought you trouble.

66
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,135
I think it would be best to break it off.

67
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:23,721
No, no, Charly.

68
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,392
Is that really what you want?

69
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:35,858
[sighs]

70
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,444
Ah, I have something for you.

71
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,332
What I just gave you is a bomb,

72
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,002
and I don't know what will happen
to my family when it explodes.

73
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,587
My only hope is that León can escape

74
00:04:56,671 --> 00:05:00,174
from all the bullshit my dad's
involved in, and from this town.

75
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:38,796
[bell tolls]

76
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,050
WELCOME TO THE BIG EVENT
THE KING OF THE MACHOS

77
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,426
[Inés] Today is, without a doubt,

78
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,762
the most important
and exciting day of the year.

79
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:49,223
The Cowboy Corral is filled with people
who've come from near and far

80
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:53,061
to witness the crowning
of our next Macho King.

81
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:56,105
It's an exciting day
here in San José de las Tunas,

82
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,691
perhaps the only one, in this town
where nothing ever happens.

83
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,651
Today, the contest to select
the winner of...

84
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,362
Look, there's your spot.

85
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,446
Come on.

86
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,201
- [Alonso] Good day.
- How are you? [chuckles]

87
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,827
- [Alonso] Welcome.
- How are you?

88
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,579
- I'll see you later, Grandpa.
- Good afternoon.

89
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:12,663
That way.

90
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,166
[Inés] Good luck, Charly.

91
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:20,296
Mr. Mayor, it's so good to see you here,
especially with how busy you are.

92
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,508
Look, I just wanted to thank you
for all your support.

93
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:27,178
You've helped me much more
than you realize, eh? [chuckles]

94
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:29,847
Charly.

95
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,558
Thanks.

96
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,696
I'm going for a bottle opener, eh?

97
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,701
Afternoon.
Do you have a bottle opener, please?

98
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,328
Yep, that's the one.

99
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,498
- Now...
- Good afternoon, sir.

100
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,209
Good afternoon, miss.

101
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,253
A pleasure. Pepe Tejeda.

102
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:04,382
My pleasure. Fidelia, but call me Fides.

103
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:09,303
What a musical name.
Fides, Fidelia, like the opera.

104
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:12,223
Oh, my, how did you know that's my name?

105
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,267
What's my name?

106
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,812
Ah, Pepe Tejeda. A pleasure.
Your servant and friend, eh?

107
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:21,524
Fidelia, my pleasure, but call me Fides.

108
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,443
- Fides, Fidelia.
- Mm-hmm.

109
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,153
Would you like a little drink?

110
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,362
Sure.

111
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,281
A glass for the little lady, please.

112
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,283
You're going to love this.

113
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:31,742
- It's all vitamins, you'll see.
- Thanks.

114
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,035
It keeps me looking great.

115
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,037
From the start, show her who's boss,

116
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,790
and go for broke with that fucking broad,
dude. No mercy.

117
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,460
- Ooh, ooh, ooh!
- Ooh, ooh, ooh!

118
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,752
[friend] Good, dude.

119
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:44,297
You just focus
and use his attacks against him.

120
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,757
Remember, skill is better than strength.

121
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:49,760
And you've got more than enough,
little brother. [chuckles]

122
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,309
Hey, focus.

123
00:07:58,227 --> 00:07:59,353
Let's go.

124
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:08,905
Hope you're having a very good afternoon,
dear residents of Tunas and visitors.

125
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,908
Today is a crucial and iconic day
for everyone.

126
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,952
The grand finale is about to start!

127
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:17,371
[cheering, whistling]

128
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:20,374
The great battle that
we've awaited for weeks:

129
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:25,588
the final duel between
Charly Tejeda and León Castillo.

130
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:29,425
Let the competitors come in!
And let's hear it for your macho.

131
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,385
THE FINAL TEST
MACHO DUEL

132
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:37,683
A brutal fight, hand-to-hand combat,
sweat-to-sweat.

133
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,394
[spectators cheering]

134
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:47,818
[chanting] Evil will not triumph,
evil will not triumph!

135
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:52,448
[chanting] Charly, Charly, Charly!

136
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,283
Fight tough! Finish her, my boy!

137
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,244
Bravo, son!

138
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:59,872
[Antonia] Tempers are running hot,
and you know why?

139
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:00,957
- Why?
- Why?

140
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,210
Because people know that
we're about to make history!

141
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,587
- That's right! Go, Charly, go!
- Don't go anywhere, folks.

142
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:07,505
Attaboy!

143
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:08,673
{\an8}LEÓN is the BEST!

144
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,508
{\an8}- Go, Charly!
- [Joel] Round one!

145
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,468
[bell rings]

146
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:17,265
- [friend] Focus. Focus.
- [Ramón] Go, Charly! You've got this, bro.

147
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:19,433
Good!

148
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,066
[friend] Break him, asshole!
You've got it!

149
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,818
[Ramón] You've got him, don't let go!

150
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,236
Go, Charly! Good!

151
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,238
- He's back up! That's it!
- Go, Charly!

152
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:36,242
- [Ramón] There it is! That's it!
- [friend] León, pressure.

153
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,537
[friend speaks indistinctly]

154
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,372
You've got it, you've got it! There!

155
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:44,125
Squeeze her, squeeze her!
You've got it. Come on, León.

156
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:45,668
[Ramón] Nothing, nothing.

157
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,336
That's it!

158
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:48,963
You've got it.

159
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:54,343
She's tired, she's tired, León!
Now's the time! Let's go!

160
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,553
Great, León!

161
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:58,306
[both straining]

162
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,142
Underneath, underneath, dude!

163
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,435
[Ramón] Come on!

164
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,438
You've got it! There, you've got him.

165
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,440
- Hey.
- [Charly groans, yells]

166
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,067
- Hey, what about that stomp?
- [friend] Good, dude! Good!

167
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,444
That's it! Hell yeah, assholes.

168
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:12,862
That's it! Good.

169
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,281
[Joel]
And the winner of this round is León...

170
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:18,534

00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,505
Come here. How are you feeling?

175
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,798
- Good.
- Really?

176
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,052
[Ramón sighs]

177
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,929
Charly, you have to focus.

178
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,641
You know what to do
if things get ugly. Mmm?

179
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,392
How are you feeling?

180
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,729
- I'm fine.
- Come on. Come on.

181
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:47,813
You can do this.

182
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:52,068
[Joel] Round two!

183
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,195

[referee] Round two.

185
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,657
- [Joel] León looks confident...
- [whistle blows]

186
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,950
...with the advantage he's carrying
from the first round.

187
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,287
[Ramón] Come on, Charly, come on, come on!

188
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,125
[Lázaro] And pay attention
to what you're doing!

189
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,960
[friend] There you go, León, good.

190
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,921
Tire her out, tire her out, León!

191
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,839
[Ramón] That's it,
don't give in, don't give in!

192
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,258
[friend] Squeeze tight, dude.
You have to squeeze.

193
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,136
Come on, León.

194
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,263
[Ramón] Good, do it again!

195
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:24,892
- [Antonia] Come on, Charly! You can do it!
- Charly, be strong!

196
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,061
[Ramón] Hey, it's okay.
Get up, get up, get up!

197
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:30,189
Stop toying with her and finish her off,
knock her down!

198
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,776
[Ramón] Focus! That'll work, there it is.

199
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,778
[friend] Pressure, pressure. Good!

200
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,738
No, no, no!

201
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,365
Get lower. Cover yourself.

202
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,283
- Here, squeeze the elbow!
- [groans]

203
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,576
[Ramón] Good! Come on.

204
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,413
Once more, once more.

205
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:49,291
Show me that you're not
as big a dumbass as you look, damn it!

206
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,714
- [friend] No, no, León!
- [Ramón] That's it!

207
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:56,716
[Charly yells]

208
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,469
- Fuck yeah!
- That's it!

209
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,596

211
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,851
- [laughs]
- [Charly] That's it!

212
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,477
That's my granddaughter's boyfriend.

213
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,603
[Antonia] Go, Charly!

214
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,857

216
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,151
[Charly] Yeah!

217
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,154
Go, Charly!

218
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,077
[in English] Then back.

219
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,996
[in Spanish] We're not supporting
Charly anymore, eh?

220
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,498
- Why not?
- Shh. I'll tell you later.

221
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:33,711
- León, León, León!
- Charly, Charly, Charly!

222
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:38,883
León, León, León, León, León!

00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:47,016
[Joel] We're seeing incredible things
in today's match.

224
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:52,062
The participant who wins this round
will be crowned for all eternity

225
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:58,819
{\an8}as the machoest macho of all the machos
in San José de las Tunas.

226
00:12:58,903 --> 00:12:59,737
[exclaims]

227
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:03,032

229
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,161
If he doesn't win, I'll kill him.

230
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,706
Finish off Charlota, asshole.

231
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,083
Don't be fooled
by that witch's tricks, dude.

232
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,961
Ready to checkmate those Castillos?

233
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,129
Come on, dog.

234
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,714
Come on. Stay strong.

235

[referee] Fighters, to the ring.

[whistle blows]

238
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,018

239
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:39,235
[Charly groaning]

240
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,195
[friend] You've got her,
you've got her! There!

241
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,780
[Charly strains]

242
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:45,574
[León groans]

243
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,995
[friend] Come on, León, focus.

244
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,622
[Lázaro] Finish her off, dumbass!

245
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,249
Come on, son!

246
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:02,508
[groaning, straining]

247
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,760
Good. Don't let him go. Don't let him go.

248
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,097
[grunting, straining continues]

249
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,395
[friend] Shit, come on!

250
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:18,357
[Lázaro] You're useless!
Get that lesbian off of you, fuck it!

251
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,776
[León yells, groans]

252
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,654
[Ramón] That's it, Charly, that's it.

253
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:26,198
Let's see if you grow some balls, asshole!

254
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,450
You look like a fucking fool!

255
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,786
Don't talk to him like that,
he's not doing so badly.

256
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,330
[Lázaro] You look like a little fag!

257
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,207
[spectators gasping]

258
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,419
[Antonia] Charly, you can do it!

259
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,754
- Stay strong, son! Stay strong, son!
- Let's go, Charly!

260
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:41,881
Attaboy, Charly!

261
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,257

[Lázaro] Hell yeah!

267
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:11,869
Attaboy! Attaboy!

268
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:15,289
A Castillo never loses!
A Castillo never loses!

269
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:24,798
And the undisputed winner of
The King of the Machos is León Castillo!

270
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,050
[horn blares]

271
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,845
All that glitters is not gold.

272
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,389
Trust me, bro.

273
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:35,643
- [shouts]

274
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:37,645
[friend] Hell yeah!

275

[spectators continue chanting]

279
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:03,504
My dears, as you can see,
the audience confirms it,

280
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:07,049
Charly is the undisputed winner
of this town!

288
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:37,162
[Víctor]
Dear residents of Tunas and visitors,

289
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:41,208
presenting the new King of the Machos,

290
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,962
León Castillo.

291
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:48,257
[triumphant music playing]

292
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:54,304
- [Joel] In your honor, in your honor.
- [Víctor chuckles]

293
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:02,438
León, I give you the biceps,
with the whole body,

294
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:06,483
a replica of your ancestor,
Mr. Anastasio Castillo,

295
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:09,486
may he rest in peace,
and not be offended by my words.

296
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,405
[Joel] He will be proud of you.

297
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:21,582
[Miriam] We also give you
this enormous check in cash

298
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,500
{\an8}for 50,000 pesos.

299
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,127
{\an8}FIRST-PLACE WINNER

300
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:30,257
{\an8}And, last of all, we're giving you
the keys to this beautiful tractor,

301
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,968
which has been proven to be
an agricultural beast,

302
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,971
worthy of the most macho tasks.

303
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,514
[Víctor laughs]

304
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,684
[horns blaring]

305
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,770
[Joel] What is Mr. Lázaro doing here?

306
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,646
[Víctor] You can tell
he likes the spotlight.

307
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,731
[Joel chuckles] Yeah.

308
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,483
[Joel laughs]

309
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,902
Uh, welcome, Lázaro.

310
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,612
A round of applause.

311
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:54,573
Generations of machos. [chuckles]

312
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:57,785
Today, we're all winners,

313
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,536
except for Charly,
who ended up in second place.

314
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,997
- Come and get your certificate, please.
- [Miriam chuckles]

316
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,085

317
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,670
- Congratulations. Congratulations.
- Bravo!

318
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:13,133
{\an8}[Miriam] This has been a great edition,
dear men and women of Tunas.

319
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:16,095
{\an8}[Víctor] Ah, it was thrilling.
Right, Mr. Joel?

320
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,222
{\an8}Abigail - You saved my brother
Now... Save us all!!

321
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,057
{\an8}[Joel] They've raised the bar very high.
Miriam?

322
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,683
{\an8}[Miriam laughs]

323
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,394
{\an8}We'll see you in the next edition of

324
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:28,524
- The King of the Machos.
- [Joel, Víctor] The King of the Machos.

325
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:33,070
[Joel speaks indistinctly] No, no. No, no.

326
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:35,405
There it is. Mr. Victor, Mr. Victor.

327
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,407
Oh... [speaks indistinctly]

328
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,372
[mic feedback echoes]

329
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:47,000
Honestly, I've had to walk
a very difficult path

330
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,585
that has been full of obstacles.

331
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,130
And not just me.

332
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:56,260
Even my family has been attacked
by the closure of our hostel,

333
00:18:56,343 --> 00:19:02,057
an unjustified and arbitrary action
that was planned by Mr. Lázaro Castillo.

334
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,518
[spectators gasping]

335
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:08,188
One thing I can say for sure
is that we all know

336
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,191
that Mr. Lázaro Castillo
has been controlling the town

337
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,610
with threats and intimidation for years.

338
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:17,156
What you don't know is that he also
treated himself to buying the elections

339
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,740
so that Navarro would be in power.

340
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:25,455
And if you don't believe me,
here is the proof.

341
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,167
[all gasping]

342
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,085
FROM L. CASTILLO - $1,475,000
FROM L. CASTILLO - $4,000,000

343
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,170
FROM L. CASTILLO - $7,400,000

344
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:40,929
And why do you think Castillo would spend
so much money for something like this?

345
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,599
It's so he can boss the mayor around
however he wants,

346
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,101
so that the government
will support his businesses,

347
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,271
- leaving all of us in second place.
- That's photoshopped,

348
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:53,859
and what's coming out of her mouth
are pure lies, it's slander.

349
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:56,236
- Those are donations. Yes, I'm sure.
- Donations.

350
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,489
Come on, please, take the microphone away
from that butch now.

351
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,452
Are you finished, Lázaro?

352
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,788
No, I'm not finished with you,
fucking bitch!

353
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:11,126
I'm going to sue you
until you have to pawn your last tooth.

354
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,712
- Get out of here! Get out of here!
- [Lázaro] Claudia, León.

355
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,005
- Get out!
- Out!

356
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:18,091
- Pig!
- [Lázaro] Claudia! Claudia!

357
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,801
[Charly] But I'm not finished.

358
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,303
[camera shutter clicks]

359
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:24,973
Do you remember when I was
the mayor's favorite pet?

360
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,809
- [Jerónimo] No, don't start with all that.
- [Angélica] No, Juanito, enough.

361
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,479
How do you think Castillo managed to
get him to turn his back on me

362
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,939
and order the hostel to be shut down?

363
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,857
Hey, hey, hey! Look, look.

364
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:36,026
Charly, that's unrelated, eh?

365
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:38,528
That stuff is pure fake news. [chuckles]

366
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:41,156
Don't waste spit denying it, Jerónimo.

367
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,952
I have proof. I have proof.

368
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,828
But I'll warn you
that this is sensitive stuff.

369
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,289
[Jerónimo stammers]
So, what... Proof of... I think that...

370
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:52,125
[spectators gasping]

371
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,544
[Angélica] What the hell, Jerónimo?

372
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,631
What the hell, Jerónimo?
What the hell, Jerónimo?

373
00:20:57,714 --> 00:21:00,759
- What the fuck is this? What the hell!
- [stammers] No...

374
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:04,846
And on top of that, you bring me to live
in this fucking town full of scumbags!

375
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,556
I hate you all!

376
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,309
I hate San José de las Tunas!

377
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:12,271
[spectators booing]

378
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,563
[Angélica] Move!

379
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,775
Get lost, leave! Leave! Leave! Leave!

380
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:21,280
[all] Leave! Leave! Leave! Leave!

381
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:27,286
[chanting] Leave! Leave! Leave! Leave!
Leave! Leave! Leave! Leave!

382
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:31,123
Bye! Good luck with your campaign!

383
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,584
[spectators chanting]
Leave, leave, leave, leave!

384
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:37,254
[Charly] In the beginning,
I entered this contest

385
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:41,216
to prove that I could be
as manly as anyone in this town,

386
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:45,137
but that's not necessary anymore.

387
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:51,601
This whole deal, that in this town
a man doesn't count if he isn't macho,

388
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:54,021
if he doesn't just take it
when he's in pain,

389
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,981
if he doesn't treat women badly.

390
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,066
All that and for what?

391
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:02,529
That's why, although it's up to you,

392
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:06,325
I say that this contest
should disappear forever.

393
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,118
[spectators cheer]

394
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:12,748
As for me, I know
what kind of man I am and want to be,

395
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,792
and I don't have to prove it to anybody.

396
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,587
Down with The King of the Machos!

397
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,675
Down with The King of the Machos!

398
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,928
Down with The King of the Machos!

399
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:30,932
[chanting]
Down with The King of the Machos!

400
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,894
No! No, no, no, no. Of course not!

401
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:36,313
- Down with The King of the Machos!
- [Eduviges] Of course not!

402
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:40,609
Down with The King of the Machos!
Down with The King of the Machos!

403
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,778
WE STAND WITH CHARLY

404
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,654
[chanting]
Down with The King of the Machos!

405
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:49,409
Down with The King of the Machos!
Down with The King of the Machos!

406
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:53,121
Down with The King of the Machos!
Down with The King of the Machos!

407
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,583
Down with The King of the Machos!
Down with The King of the Machos!

408
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:02,506
Dear viewers, I'm Inés Montoya,
and what we're witnessing today is

409
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:05,217
a watershed moment
in San José de las Tunas.

410
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:09,971
Our town has never experienced
a revolution of this magnitude.

411
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:14,893
THE KING OF THE MACHOS
EDITION CXVI - YEAR 2022

412
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:16,728
But what am I seeing?

413
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:17,854
Machorrín?

414
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:21,691
Down with The King of the Machos!
Down with The King of the Machos!

415
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:24,027
[chanting]
Down with The King of the Machos!

416
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:28,323
Down with The King of the Machos!
Down with The King of the Machos!

417
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,826
Down with The King of the Machos!

418
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:37,416
Son! Very good! Good!

419
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:42,045
- [Alonso] We won, son!
- Down with The King of the Machos!

420
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,964
{\an8}SAN JOSÉ DE LAS TUNAS REBELS
AGAINST THE KING OF THE MACHOS

421
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:46,883
{\an8}<i>This is certainly a town
that we can be proud of.</i>

422
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:52,139
{\an8}<i>Down with The King of the Machos!
Down with The King of the Machos!</i>

423
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,391
{\an8}<i>Down with machos!</i>

424
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,560
Shut up.

425
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:59,229
Okay, okay, okay. Hey, excuse me.
Okay, okay. Okay.

426
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,148
Honestly, I can't believe...

427
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:02,566
What are you saying, woman?

428
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:05,318
Down with The King of the Machos!
Down with The King of the Machos!

429
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:09,156
Down with The King of the Machos!
Down with The King of the Machos!

430
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:12,576
Down with The King of the Machos!
Down with The King of the Machos!

431
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:15,537
If it weren't for your shenanigans,
I'd never see you.

432
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:19,416
[chanting continues]

433
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,418
You know me, I can't stay still.

434
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,753
- [laughs]
- [Angélica] Come here, Jerónimo!

435
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,714
- Great, scoundrel, eh?
- Hi, Toñito.

436
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,924
- Lázaro! Lázaro, Lázaro.
- Let's grab some beers

437
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:30,427
- and tell me what you're up to.
- Dude, wait.

438
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,554
Like, what's up
with what's going down here?

439
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:33,763
Lázaro, my ass!

440
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:36,308
If you'd stopped that witch
at the right time,

441
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:39,853
we wouldn't be in this mess now.

442
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:44,024
So now you go
and get yourself out of it, dumbass.

443
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:45,859
- [Jerónimo mumbles indistinctly]
- Claudia.

444
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,360
[Jerónimo chuckles] Psst.

445
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:53,700
- [Lázaro] Take care of them. Let's go.
- But... Uh, but... Claudia...

446
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:56,328
- The family, dude.
- How dare you, Jerónimo?

447
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:59,206
- Don't hit me again, eh?
- Fucking corn-face!

448
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:03,126
That's what you learned
from your cheap soap operas, eh?

449
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,587
You've cost me too much,
you've cost me too much!

450
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,672
CHANGING ROOM MEN

451
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,758
[water running]

452
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,523
[León] Why did you let me beat you?

453
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:28,443
I didn't let you beat me.

454
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,737
Don't bullshit me,
I know perfectly well what you did.

455
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:33,448
Who cares?

456
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:36,117
León, you can leave this town.

457
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,996
Your dad will never lay
another finger on you.

458
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,295
What's this?

459
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,881
They're the keys to the tractor,
it's half of the prize.

460
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:51,967
It's only fair, Charly.

461
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:58,932
Thanks.

462
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:23,498
[bell tolls]

463
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,084
[student]
At 7:00 in the multipurpose room,

464
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:28,545
we'll have a discussion
about sexual diversity.

465
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,255
You're all invited.

466
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:33,967
Come on out, at 7:00. Don't miss it.

467
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,845
You're all invited.

468
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:41,099
Oh, Doloritas, my <i>comadre</i>,
what a disgrace our town has become!

469
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,896
Oh, my <i>comadre</i>, with so much revolution,
honestly, I've realized a few things

470
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,025
and I have to tell you something.

471
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,287
[Pepe] I'd like you to meet Charly,

472
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,914
he's my grandson
and we're very proud of him.

473
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:08,460
Nice to meet you, son. Congratulations.

474
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:10,545
[chuckles] Nice to meet you, ma'am.

475
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:16,843
Thanks, Grandpa.

476
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:19,804
[sighs]

477
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,224
Never come down from the clouds, okay?

478
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:31,524
We'll miss you.

479
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:34,027
And I'll miss you, dear Marquito.

480
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:35,904
[chuckles]

481
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:40,492
[both chuckle]

482
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:42,535
Wow, it's so hot, isn't it? [sniffles]

483
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,704
- Even my eyes are sweating.
- [chuckles]

SAN JOSÉ DE LAS TUNAS
BUS STATION

485
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:47,290
It's okay.

486
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:56,591
[Charly sniffles]

487
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:00,053
You sure you won't come with me?

488
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:02,764
With the sale of the tractor,
we can see what happens, or not.

489
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,683
No, no, no, I don't know, just wait.

490
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,810
I need my time.

491
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:12,190
Besides, you and I will always be together
in some way or another. Right?

492
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:16,403
Or did you think
you could get rid of me so easily?

493
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:18,780
[chuckles, sniffles] I know I can't.

494
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:19,864
No.

495
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:22,992
[Charly sobs]

496
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,374
I love you, Antonia.

497
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,211
Love you too.

498
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:34,379
With my whole heart.

499
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,275
Are you sure you have to go, son?

500
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,070
Yes, Mom.

501
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,283
I'm going to miss you a ton.

502
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:06,369
But I can't stay in this town.

503
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:12,584
[Alonso] Remember that
whenever you need us, we'll be here.

504
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:24,179
You know that I couldn't have
done it without you, right?

505
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,308
[Charly cries]

506
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,396
- [laughs]
- [Estela chuckles]

507
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,398
[Charly] It looks like me.

508
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:36,483
[chuckles]

509
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:52,957
[bus engine starts]

510
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,585
- Bye, Charly.
- [Charly chuckles] Bye.

511
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:57,003
[Estela] Bye.

512
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,213
[Pepe] Attaboy, Charly.

513
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:59,297
