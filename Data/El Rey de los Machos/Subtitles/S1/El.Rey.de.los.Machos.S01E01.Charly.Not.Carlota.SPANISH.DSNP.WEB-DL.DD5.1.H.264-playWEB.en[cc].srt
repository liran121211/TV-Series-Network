00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,003
[music on music box]

2
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:11,219
[music stops]

3
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:45,128
Happy 18th Carlota!!

4
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:51,760
- [parent 1] I took it out and didn't...
- Shorty!

5
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:54,512
- Oh, you look so handsome.
- [sighs]

6
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:55,680
Want a beer?

7
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:58,725
No, you know that I get
very buzzed very quickly.

8
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:00,810
[clippers buzzing]

9
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,155
[laughs]

10
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,711
That's it, good.

11
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:29,631
[chuckles] Hey, Grandpa,
don't you want a glass for your beer?

12
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:31,257
No, it all fits in here. Don't worry.

13
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,342
- [parent 2] Dad!
- Cheers.

14
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:40,809
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

15
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,815
[parent 2] Welcome, welcome.

16
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:48,900
[guest] Thank you very much.

17
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,905
[parent 2] Eat up, it's all delicious.

18
00:01:58,785 --> 00:01:59,869
Carlota?

19
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:02,163
[Shorty] Daughter?

20
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,249
[band playing music]

21
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,089
Wait, no, no, stop, stop, please.

22
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,716
[laughs] That's a cool costume, cousin,

23
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,635
but you went a little far
with the sausage.

24
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:19,180
I have something very important
to tell you.

25
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,474
I'm not Carlota anymore.

26
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,729
From now on, I'm Charly.

27
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,861
Daughter, your guests are all here.

28
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,904
You're joking, right?
You're playing around, aren't you?

29
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,614
No, Dad.

30
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,116
This is the realest thing ever.

31
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,619
And since you're here,
I want you to know that I've known

32
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,831
- for a long time that I'm a man.
- [crowd gasping]

33
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:47,125
And I couldn't wait any longer
to be who I really am.

34
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,210
[crowd whispering]

35
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,177
Now what? Should we start up again?

36
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,095
[Shorty] No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

37
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,388
You and I will talk later, eh?

38
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,687
We'd better be going, Carlotita.

39
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:08,813
Get well soon.

40
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,440
I'm already better, Aunt.

41
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,691
Thanks for coming.

42
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:14,444
- Take care. See you later.
- [grandparent] Goodness.

43
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,071
My granddaughter Carlota is taking
her time,

44
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,907
but when she comes down,
I'll introduce you to her.

45
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,825
You'll see that she's a cutie.

46
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,410
Grandpa, it's me.

47
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:23,828
- Now I'm Charly.
- [swallows]

48
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,789
- Charly?
- Yes.

49
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,708
Oh, nice to meet you, Charly.

50
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,084
I'm Grandpa Pepe.

51
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,753
My granddaughter won't be long, eh?

52
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:32,962
Don't leave.

53
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,130
You'll like her!

54
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,257
- You'll like her. [laughs]
- [chuckles] Grandpa!

55
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,426
[sighs] Oh.

56
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,386
[laughs]

57
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,432
Well, if you look on the bright side,
they're already getting you a girlfriend.

58
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:46,517
<i>Hey, happy 18th, little brother.</i>

59
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:51,314
Hey, my clothes look better
on you than on me. [laughs]

60
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,191
- You look great.
- [Charly] <i>Thank you.</i>

61
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,652
<i>Although Mom doesn't think so.</i>

62
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,488
[sibling] They didn't see it coming.

63
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,949
Honestly, nobody could have imagined it.

64
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,200
<i>Give them time.</i>

65
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:05,370
- <i>The news came out of nowhere.</i>
- [laughs]

66
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:08,498
Bro, I've got to go,
but I'll call you later, hmm?

67
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,042
Enjoy your birthday, brother.

68
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,045
Take care. I love you.

69
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,214
- Bye.
- <i>I love you.</i>

70
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,883
- See you later.
- Bye.

71
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:27,225
Well, in light of our huge success,

72
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:30,937
we can move on directly
to phase two: the plan.

73
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,021
[Charly chuckles]

74
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,607
Oh, give me a hug.

75
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:44,117
- [sighs] Congratulations, Charly.
- [both chuckle]

76
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:49,998
THE KING OF THE MACHOS

77
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,591
{\an8}[vendor] Ice cream, ice cream, ice cream!

78
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,724
{\an8}Don't be discouraged, eh, my Charly?

79
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,601
{\an8}Just because I got it
from the start doesn't mean

80
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,562
{\an8}that everyone else was going to.

81
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,063
{\an8}And we already knew that.

82
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,356
{\an8}Yeah, yeah, I know.

83
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:19,110
{\an8}Why do you think I can't wait
until we leave for college?

84
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,361
{\an8}Oh, I know.

85
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,446
{\an8}Can you imagine?

86
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:24,824
{\an8}You and me in Mexico City,
breaking all the rules,

87
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:29,495
{\an8}- meeting a bunch of guys. And girls.
- [both chuckle]

88
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:33,207
{\an8}And the most important thing,
we'll be far away from here.

89
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,752
{\an8}- Far away.
- [sighs] This is getting in my way.

90
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:39,797
{\an8}Let's go. Come on, it's all good.

91
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,842
{\an8}Carlota? No shit.

92
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,260
{\an8}What's your costume supposed to be?

93
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,636
{\an8}Your poor hair.

94
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,472
{\an8}No, this isn't Carlota anymore.

95
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,307
{\an8}Now, it's Charly.

96
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:53,353
{\an8}Gender is something very fluid nowadays,
and now, Charly is a man.

97
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,355
{\an8}Fluid? What? What the fuck?

98
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,065
{\an8}You and I kissed at Ricky's party.

99
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:58,524
{\an8}- What?
- It was a long time ago, I swear.

100
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:01,152
{\an8}We all make mistakes, Mario, even me.

101
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,820
{\an8}Hey, does that mean that...

102
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,197
{\an8}That you kissed a guy.

103
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,782
{\an8}Hey, fucking freak.

104
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,201
{\an8}I'm not a fag.

105
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:11,371
Well, as I recall, you're the one
who insisted on kissing me.

106
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:14,082
Hey, enough, love, enough. Calm down.

107
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,458
Get away from that slut.

108
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:17,877
[Charly kisses]

109
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,046
- Fucking lesbian.
- Enough. Calm down.

110
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,175
- [parent] Mario!
- Mommy.

111
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,302
I asked you to bring
the tortillas two hours ago.

112
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,012
- I swear... I was...
- Get inside. You know what?

113
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,764
Enough. Get inside. And you go and study.

114
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:32,350
- But they're my friends.
- Come on. Don't talk to me about friends.

115
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,018
Those aren't friends, asshole.

116
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,478
Get inside. You're done.

117
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,399
Why didn't you tell me about Mario?

118
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:42,568
I thought you only had bad streaks,
but never bad taste.

119
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,654
That was Carlota.

120
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,697
- Don't blame me.
- Oh, really? How convenient.

121
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:49,575
[reporter] And as you already know,
dear residents of Tunas,

122
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,953
the most anticipated time
of year has arrived, when the entire town

123
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:55,206
of San José de las Tunas gathers
with great passion to watch

124
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:59,377
its young men compete to win
the town's title of "The Most Macho."

125
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,171
Registration for The King
of the Machos is open

126
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,966
and the contest will begin in one week.

127
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:06,968
They're going to start
the Neanderthal parade.

128
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:10,847
[reporter] Our young men who are 18 will
be under a lot of pressure for a month.

129
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,641
A month of proving that they are men
to the core.

130
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:17,937
A month in which their families shall
dream that their young man

131
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,023
will be given the award of being
the most macho in the whole town.

132
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,276
- So they'll go from thug to the best thug.
- [chuckles]

133
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:26,654
In addition, the name
of the winner will be immortalized

134
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:29,574
on a plaque on the monument
behind me next to

135
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:32,994
the formidable figure
of Anastasio Castillo, who was the winner

136
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:36,164
of the first King of the Machos
way back in 1906.

137
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:41,294
And speaking of Anastasio Castillo,
I'm here today with his great-grandson,

138
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:43,588
Mr. Lázaro Castillo, and his family.

139
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,965
Mr. Castillo, how are you feeling?

140
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:48,509
How do you expect me to feel, dear Inés?

141
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:52,513
Excited, now that my boy here is going
to raise the exalted name

142
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:57,393
of Castillo in this competition, a source
of pride to all residents of Tunas.

143
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,187
<i>How about you, León, how do you feel?</i>

144
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,897
<i>Nervous, excited?</i>

145
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,483
Honestly, I'd like to already be
in the contest

146
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:06,277
and prove to everyone
that the Castillos are the most macho

147
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,487
- of them all.
- [giggles]

148
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,821
- [Lázaro] That's my boy.
- [chuckles]

149
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:12,492
They'll realize who the Castillos are,
what they're made of.

150
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,828
- All hot air and beer.
- [both chuckle]

151
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,209
[crowd cheering]

152
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,841
Good afternoon, ma'am.
Don Ponciano, forgive me, please.

153
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,718
The rooster next to my house got sick...

154
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,303
- I don't care.
- ...if you can imagine...

155
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:35,765
This is the last time.
Next time, you're outta here, got it?

156
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,351
Go keep an eye on your cousin,
she's looking to hook up.

157
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,770
- Go on, kid.
- I know.

158
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,146
Hey!

159
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:46,317
They're saying you're hooking up, cousin.
Who's your guy?

160
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,777
What's wrong with you?

161
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,945
Don't you recognize him?

162
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,534
- You're kidding. Carlota!
- [Charly chuckles] Uh, no.

163
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:57,954
[Marquito] Ah. No wonder I was never,
ever attracted to you.

164
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,665
Marquito, you're breaking my heart.

165
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,584
[Charly, friend 1 laugh]

166
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,670
Come on, bring me the surprise already.

167
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:08,673
- [Marquito] It's because she's jealous...
- Today is Charly's birthday!

168
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,969
Patrons of the Scorpion,

Why is she doing this to us, Shorty?
What did we do wrong?

193
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:06,666
Nothing. Calm down.

194

- How awful for you, honey.

00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,362
I don't know how you can stand
something like that.

224

Thank you very much.

Excuse me.

Can't you see that his daughter can take
more than him?

238
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:51,956
Look, my compadre, well, he's a bit of a
fag when it comes to drinking, am I right?

239
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,458
Okay, that's enough, all right?

240
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:57,795
What's enough?

- Hey, where are you going?
- I haven't had breakfast, Dad.

You sound like an old lady,
complaining all the time.

Go on, you have still one more set.

250
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,240
Lázaro, can you let the baby eat?

251
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:29,118
And can you shut up and stop spoiling him?

252
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:30,744
This is men's business.

253
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,080
You're right.

254

I wouldn't stop training. [chuckles]

What happened to you?

Oh, you know how clumsy your dad is.

Well, I... I tripped and I fell.

Yes, what happened was,
I was carrying all the stuff

271
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,781
from the store and, well... well...
I fell and I tripped. [chuckles]

272
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,407
And where's the stuff you bought?

273
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,952
What do you mean, "Where's the stuff?"
It's all over the ground.

274
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,870
That's where it stayed.

275
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,205
It was all ruined there.

Don't worry, Daughter.

00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,421
Sorry. [sighs] Son.

My... My brave one, my champion.

279
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:13,055
I'm sorry if... if sometimes I make
mistakes with this,

280
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,515
it's just force of habit.

281
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,141
Dad, it's okay.

282
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,018
It's okay.

283
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,272
Can I go now? Um... Because I'm in a hurry.

284
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:25,025
- Yes. Yes, don't worry. Of course.

Okay, fine.

00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:27,731
- Enough.
- Yeah, right?

339
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:28,899
- Take it off.
- [León] Yeah.

340
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:31,985
Take it off, take it off!

341
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,362
Well, I could.

342
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:37,616
But honestly, I'm not interested in
pleasing a bunch of Neanderthals like you.

343
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,118
Those are the rules.

344
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,994
If you agree, fine, and if not, fuck you.

345
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,287
- Huh? Huh?
- No, no, no.

346
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,206
Don't force him. Let him take it off!

347
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,958
Hey, don't touch me!

348
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:49,086
No! Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

349
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,380
Oh!

350
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,465
[group laughing]

351
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,386
Good, good, good, good, good.

352
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,597
[friend 3] Ooh! [laughing]

353
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:01,807
Hey, León?

354
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,642
What did they do to you as a child?

355
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,687
Not so macho? [laughing]

356
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,313
You cry like a girl!

357
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,859
Go and play with your dolls, phenom!

358
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,278
[group laughing]

359
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,531
Hey, I've had it up to here
with that bastard

360
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,616
and his little band of macho assholes.

361
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,077
Me too, but they are who they are, Charly.

362
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,371
Yeah, they are who they are
because we let them.

363
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:26,790
But I'd fucking love to stop them
in their tracks.

364
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,250
And why not?

365
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,752
Show them what you're made of, Charly.
Like you always have.

366
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,212
Oh, I'm not like that.

367
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,755
Yes, you are.

368
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:36,717
Did you forget Jacinto from second grade?

369
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,888
<i>He shoved you in the Nativity play.</i>

370
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:44,516
You were so mad, that you told him
his parents were Santa Claus.

371
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,560
That's not true, liar!

372
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:49,229
[children laugh]

373
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,856
[Charly] <i>Well, somebody had to tell him.</i>

374
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:53,817
What about Rebeca?

375
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:57,279
Did you forget how you ruined her life
in fifth grade?

376
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:58,739
Who's Rebeca, dude?

377
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:02,409
The one who called you a tomboy
because of your Messi jersey.

378
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:05,621
- You told her she was adopted.
- Really?

379
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,416
Well, someone was going
to have to tell her.

380
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:10,667
Her parents?

381
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:13,921
Someone was going to have to tell her,
and I was just the messenger of truth.

382
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:16,506
Oh, really? And since when are you called
"Charly the Avenger"?

383
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,591
Since forever, you know.

384
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:19,134
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

385
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,845
- You've always been a vengeful asshole...
- [laughs]

386
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,847
...and you never let them step on you.

387
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,767
Fine. Okay. Fine.

388
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,310
- Vengeance is sweet.
- Yes, it's very sweet.

389
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,520
[announcer] <i>We remind all residents
of Tunas that registration</i>

390
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,231
<i>for the King of the Machos is open.</i>

391
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,315
THE KING OF THE MACHOS

392
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:36,068
I have to hit that asshole León
where it hurts the most.

393
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,278
[announcer] <i>We remind all residents
of Tunas that registration</i>

394
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,113
<i>for the King of the Machos is open.</i>

395
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,950
It'd be cool if you could win the King
of the Machos award from under him.

396
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:46,995
Look, he swears that he's already won it.

397
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,958
{\an8}[announcer] <i>Registration for The King

{\an8}HELP US CROWN THE KING
OF THE MACHOS

400
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,129
[Estelita] Get out, spirit.

401
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,006
Get out. Leave this room.

402
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,508
Leave. Go away.

403
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:03,011
[mutters, sighs]

404
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:08,183
Almighty God, merciful God, I ask you
for your daughter, Carlota, return her

405
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:12,062
to the path of faith, restore her
to your flock, I beg you, please.

406
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:15,399
Get out, spirit!

407
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:18,360
- Mom, what are you doing?
- Oh, Daughter.

408
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,611
Are you for real?

409
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:25,200
[inhales deeply] Well, I'm here, praying,
asking God to help you.

410
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,410
To help me to do what?

411
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,954
For you to repent for your decisions

412
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:33,292
and return to be who you are,
a lovely young woman, precious.

413
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,919
Mom, I don't repent of anything.

414
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,005
What's more...

415
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,881
[drawer opens]

416
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,176
Take all this clothing. I don't need it.
Not now, not ever.

417
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,345
No, no, no. You should keep it.

418
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,389
You should keep it. You'll need it.

419
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:50,350
You'll see that this will blow over
and you'll go back to normal.
