1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,711
[knocking on door]

2
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:05,797
[in Spanish] Who is it?

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,757
[Lázaro] Open the door, fucking Jerónimo.

4
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:10,969
Seriously?

5
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:14,973
What?

6
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:17,350
Like you don't use lotions to look good.

7
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:23,523
I don't know what the hell's wrong
with everyone in this fucking town.

8
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:25,692
But I'll tell you one thing, asshole.

9
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,069
You're going to stop
supporting that butch.

10
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,905
[laughs]

11
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:35,869
Like, seriously, you came all the way
to my house to threaten me?

12
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,788
No, no, that's not how it works, Lázaro.

13
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:43,209
Because I honestly can support
whoever I want, hmm?

14
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:46,004
And I don't know why you've got
such a problem with Charly.

15
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,672
Because, at the end of the day,

16
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:50,550
obviously, your son is the one
who's got what he needs to win.

17
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:54,262
Because that little witch
is messing around with my daughter.

18
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:55,930
Now she'll meet the real me.

19
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:04,230
Either you side with me,
or I'll air your dirty laundry.

20
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:07,859
Uh...

21
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:17,494
[Lázaro] Looks can be deceiving.

22
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:20,872
[Angélica] Baby, who is it?

23
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:25,835
- Mr. Lázaro, good evening.
- [Lázaro] Good evening, Mrs. Angélica.

24
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,129
Forgive me for coming so late

25
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:32,258
and for interrupting
your feminine beauty treatment.

26
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:36,054
Oh, Mr. Lázaro, beauty and skin care
have no gender.

27
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:39,557
How do you think my husband
stays so handsome and hot?

28
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:42,435
Baby, baby, uh, you know what?
This isn't the time.

29
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,021
We're talking about
a super urgent work matter.

30
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,315
Go and turn on the Jacuzzi, okay? Please.

31
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:48,858
Of course, babe.

32
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,861
Good evening, Mr. Lázaro.
Give my greetings to Claudia.

33
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,738
I'll let her know, Angélica.

34
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,782
- Good night.
- [Angélica] Thanks.

35
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,953
[sighs]

36
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:06,292
So, now we're ready to negotiate,
right, asshole? Come on, sit down.

37
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:15,051
THE KING OF THE MACHOS

38
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,523
{\an8}[Estela] Charly!

39
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,111
{\an8}What's up, Mom?

40
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:36,698
{\an8}Ramón!

41
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,451
{\an8}- What's going on?
- [laughs]

42
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:47,250
{\an8}- Hey, bro. You look better in person, eh?
- [chuckles]

43
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,751
{\an8}And how about that haircut?

44
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:50,378
{\an8}Well, what did you think?

45
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:54,757
{\an8}Well, to be totally honest,
I thought you'd look sort of nasty,

46
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:58,136
{\an8}like a cross between a scarecrow
and ranch Goth.

47
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:00,722
{\an8}- Ah, tell me how you really feel, eh?
- Uh-huh. You tell me.

48
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,266
{\an8}[laughing]
No, but what are you doing here?

49
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,475
{\an8}Well, what do you think?

50
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:06,936
{\an8}I came to support you.

51
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,606
{\an8}I wouldn't miss the final stretch
of the contest for anything in the world.

52
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,983
{\an8}[chuckles] Hella awesome, bro.

53
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:13,568
{\an8}I love you.

54
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:16,779
{\an8}That's how I wanted to see you. Here.

55
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,323
{\an8}Oh, wow.

56
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,490
{\an8}Thanks.

57
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:22,911
{\an8}Thanks, Mom, but why don't you
have one with us, eh?

58
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,997
{\an8}No. It's early. Mmm.

59
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,709
{\an8}I get buzzed very quickly. [chuckles]

60
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,670
{\an8}[sniffs, whispers] Oh, my boys.

61
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:40,511
Come on, León! Beat that asshole!

62
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,305
Come on, man! Come on!

63
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,224
Let's go, man!

64
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,184
Keep going, you look like a fag!

65
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:48,436
- Let's go! Let's go, León!
- [grunting]

66
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,647
You've got it. Good.

67
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,775
It's a tractor, asshole. Let's go, pull!

68
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:56,402
Yair. Let's go. Good, man.

69
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:58,696
Good.

70
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,491
Damn right, man.
That butch will remember you.

71
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,660
I'm sure that she won't have a chance
in hell of beating you.

72
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,210
- [Charly] Cheers.
- [Ramón] Cheers, man.

73
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,631
Man, you're going to love the city.

74
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:19,217
You'll see.
There are a ton of places to visit.

75
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,971
Oh, I know. I'm pretty sure that
as soon as the busy season is over,

76
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,138
I'm heading there.

77
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,640
Well, I'm going to give you
a damn good tour.

78
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,183
You're not going
to want to come back here.

79
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,935
Well, maybe I'll just stay there, eh?

80
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,229
With the scholarship I'm getting
from the mayor,

81
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,398
I'm sure that I can go and study there.

82
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:35,817
- Wow, you've turned out cocky.
- Mm-hmm.

83
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,943
Well, cheers to that.

84
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:39,112
- Cheers.
- And more cheers.

85
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,989
Boys, I need your help. Come, please.

86
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,074
- What's wrong?
- I'll explain in a minute, just come.

87
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:46,661
This is a mistake.
We're an honorable family, Inspector.

88
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,706
This is an outrage.
Please, you can't do this to us.

89
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,249
Why are you shutting us down?

90
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,001
Someone reported an infestation.

91
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:56,504
Yes, and under the state health
and safety laws, we must close the hostel,

92
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:59,007
obviously, until an official inspection
can take place.

93
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,884
- My hostel is impeccable.
- There's no infestation here.

94
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,846
Well, we'll verify that
during the inspection.

95
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:08,391
For now, you must close your facilities,
and nobody can enter the property

96
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:12,020
until the experts come and inspect.
Are we clear on that?

97
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,396
But what about my guests?

98
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,523
I don't know, ma'am. Relocate them.

99
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,358
How are we going to relocate
so many tourists?

100
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,777
That's not my problem.
I'm just informing you.

101
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,030
But don't worry,
we'll try to resolve this quickly.

102
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:24,615
I'm sure it will be sorted out
in a few months.

103
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,784
And why don't you tell us who sent you?

104
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,662
Hmm? Aren't you the bootlicker
of Mr. Castillo, you sellout witch?

105
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:30,997
- No. Uh, Charly.
- Calm down.

106
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,916
Bring me to your boss.
We're going to settle this right now.

107
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,128
Any complaints can be filed
at the town attorney's office.

108
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:40,882
No, Inspector, give us a chance.
Can't you come and inspect right now?

109
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,675
- Put the stickers up, now.
- [Alonso] No, no.

110
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,260
Just wait a little, please.

111
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,597
Inspector, worker to worker,
I'm begging you. My hostel is impeccable.

112
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,640
I clean it myself,
there aren't any mosquitos.

113
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,559
Well, go and clean it, ma'am.

114
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:54,020
- [Estela] Don't talk to me like that, eh?
- Fucking witch.

115
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,606
What the hell, dude?
How you spoke pissed her off.

116
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:59,525
What can she do, huh?
Now she really won't want to help us.

117
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,569
Oh, don't bullshit me.
She wasn't going to help us, dude.

118
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:04,447
- Don't you see that Castillo sent her?
- Hey, tone it down, asshole.

119
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:08,284
We won't settle anything like that.
You're sounding like...

120
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,911
Like the town machos, right?

121
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:13,373
- You aren't like that.
- So, what am I like, Ramón?

122
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,462
I'd better go and get this shit solved.
See you later.

123
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,679
Hi, Charly, how are you?
How can I help you?

124
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:29,972
Yes, I need to see Jerónimo.

125
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,600
Unfortunately,
the mayor is not available today.

126
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,018
Don't worry, he understands.

127
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,269
Cha...

128
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,271
This gets rid of your baggy eyes.

129
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,399
How do you think my mom
looks like a ten and she's how old?

130
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:42,527
- But this isn't... Sir, this isn't my thing.
- Jerónimo.

131
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,781
- Charly.
- Charly. Ooh. What a surprise, eh?

132
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:51,744
Honestly, right now we're super busy.
We can't see you.

133
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:52,829
Yes. I'm sorry.

134
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,289
But they've just shut down the hostel
for no reason.

135
00:06:55,373 --> 00:07:00,086
You know that our hostel is first-class.
I need your help to revoke the order.

136
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,172
I know that the Castillo family
has something to do with this.

137
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:08,094
[laughs] Charly, look. Honestly, as much
as I'd love to help you,

138
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:12,056
my hands are tied in this instance.

139
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,392
It's outside my jurisdiction.

140
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:15,893
Powers, sir.

141
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,438
- That.
- But if you can't help us, who can?

142
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,066
Uh, Juanito,
I think this is getting a little awkward.

143
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,695
Why don't you walk him to the exit,
and you give him one of the...

144
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:26,863
Contributions.

145
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,990
Contributions, uh-huh,
so that he leaves nice and happy.

146
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:31,659
No, Jerónimo, you know I wouldn't ask
you for anything if I didn't nee...

147
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:34,203
It was great to see you, eh? [chuckles]

148
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,456
Charly, Charly, forget it, come with me.

149
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,083
Come with me, Charly.

150
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,796
Thank you very much, eh?
Really, thanks for coming by.

151
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,214
Everything will be okay, Charly.

152
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,341
Gentlemen, shut the doors.

153
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,303
Juanito, I need your help.

154
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,779
- [sighs]
- [Juanito chuckles]

155
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:13,326
Are you okay? Are you sure
you know what you're doing, Mr. Mayor?

156
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:18,080
Distancing yourself from Charly right now
will get you fried, politically.

157
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,750
Especially now that you're rising
in the polls

158
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,252
and the press in the capital
is speaking very highly of you.

159
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,296
Johnny, drop it.

160
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,965
We have to move past this,
because the truth is,

161
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,677
if Castillo publicizes everything
he has on me,

162
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:37,016
I won't just take a beating in the polls,
it's going to be a knockout, eh?

163
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:41,938
And remember, just like with the Titanic,
if I sink, we all sink, bro.

164
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,024
[footsteps depart]

165
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,567
Just like with the Titanic.

166
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,029
[vendor speaking indistinctly]

167
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,906
- Hey, go Charly.
- You can do it, Charly.

168
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,951
[both chanting]
Charly, Charly! Charly, Charly!

169
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,536
[vendor continues]

170
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,147
THE KING OF THE MACHOS
THE EXTREME MACHO

171
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:29,026
{\an8}PROTECT YOUR CHILDREN
FROM TRANS-GRESSIONS

172
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:56,012
One family. Two adults, two children.

173
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:59,640
- Come on in.
- Of course, of course. And a couple too.

174
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:01,726
- Thanks.
- Yes.

175
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,145
Mom. They need a room, too.

176
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,772
Have them go into the dining room, please.
I'll be with them soon.

177
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,358
Please have a seat, eh?
We'll be with you in a moment.

178
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,028
Oh, son.
Were you able to speak to the mayor?

179
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,908
- [Estela] What time would be good...
- What's up with Charly?

180
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,869
[sighs] I don't know, son.

181
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,497
He's been like that for days, like,
I don't even recognize him.

182
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:27,001
And it's awful that they've shut down
our hostel during this busy season,

183
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,588
but what breaks my heart the most
is seeing your mom so sad

184
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,173
because of your brother's behavior.

185
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,762
THE KING OF THE MACHOS

186
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,603
Remember to focus all your effort
in the chest and the abdomen,

187
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,480
not in the legs,
because you're going to slip.

188
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:50,691
And when you're there, you give it all
you've got in a single pull.

189
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,694
Hey, hey, I'm talking to you, dude.

190
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,988
- I'm paying attention, asshole.
- No, it doesn't look like it.

191
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,033
Ever since the mountain test
you've been acting weird, dude.

192
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,911
Come on, stop bullshitting me.
Okay, what do I have to do?

193
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:05,081
Once again. You have to focus

194
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,916
all your strength in the chest
and the abdomen.

195
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,168
If you focus on your legs,
you're going to slip.

196
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:12,296
If you put it there, you'll fall,
the weight will get the better of you.

197
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:23,516
Since no true macho is respected
without brute strength,

198
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:26,560
the next test is the tractor pull.

199
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:27,645
THE TRACTOR TEST

200
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,522
The contestants have only 90 seconds

201
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:36,112
to move a two-ton tractor
as far as possible.

202
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:40,241
The same one that the winner
of the grand finale

203
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,118
will be able to take home.

204
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:48,541
Well, boys, puff out those chests
and show us what you've got, ay ay ay!

205
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:51,043
[crowd cheering]

206
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:01,470
Abi, where are you? Why didn't you come?

207
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:06,475
It's time, my dear residents of Tunas,
for this test to begin!

208
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,312
Giddy up, boys! Start the clock!

209
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,605
THE TRACTOR
WHO IS THE MOST MACHO?

210
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,119
[contestant] It's not moving at all, dude.

211
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,746
[crowd booing]

212
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,248
[grunting]

213
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,825
Come on, León, you can do it!

214
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,368
Come on, asshole, you can do it!

215
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:12,249
[crowd chanting] León, León, León, León!

216
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,670
That's it! That's it!

217
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:20,591
[chanting continues]

218
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,596
[crowd cheering]

219
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:32,603
- Good. Good, son. Good.
- Good! Good, León!

220
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:33,938
That's enough.

221
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,234
[crowd member] Bravo!

222
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:45,825
[chanting] Charly, Charly, Charly, Charly!

223
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:07,847
Come on, what the hell?

224
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,391
So, she's really happy.
And they won't do anything?

225
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,602
Take care. See you later, Mr. Castillo.

226
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,690
How are you? A pleasure.

227
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,195
Excuse me, dear Charly.

228
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,699
Can you explain
what the hell you're doing?

229
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:30,536
The test consisted of moving
the tractor and I moved it.

230
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:33,956
That's bullshit!
Tha... That doesn't count, eh?

231
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,833
No, don't fuck with me. Don't bullshit me.

232
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:40,045
Of course! That's fucking unacceptable!

233
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,922
Men and women of Tunas.

234
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:45,050
What we've just witnessed
is unprecedented,

235
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,803
but there's nothing in the rule book

236
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:51,307
that specifies how the tractor
should be moved.

237
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:55,978
Mr. Mayor, please!
Someone has to bring order here!

238
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,776
Just a minute, calm down.

239
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,613
Calm down, dear residents of Tunas.

240
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:09,450
Being aggressive
has never gotten us anywhere.

241
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:12,786
While it's true that Charly moved
the tractor in an unconventional way,

242
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:18,542
Dr. Joel also said that nothing
in the rules forbids it.

243
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,462
So then, what would Pontius Pilate do?

244
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:31,013
[clears throat]
I proclaim this test eliminated.

245
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:35,476
I don't think that's fair at all! At all!

246
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:41,273
[announcer] This honorable council agrees
with this Solomonic decision.

247
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:44,902
The tractor contest
is officially eliminated.

248
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,656
Therefore, the contestants
must duke it out

249
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:52,159
in an emergency test
that will be announced

250
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:57,373
after we take a little break
because this has just been too much.

251
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:01,168
Therefore,
we'll be back soon with the finale.

252
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:04,129
Why would you eliminate the test, asshole?

253
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:07,466
Why the hell
didn't you eliminate the butch?

254
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:14,056
You keep protecting her
and you'll find yourself in jail

255
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,183
for being a dirty old man.

256
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:19,520
Do you know what they do
to men like you in jail?

257
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,690
You don't know, right?

258
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,818
[crowd chanting] León, León, León!

259
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:28,445
[crowd chanting] Charly, Charly, Charly!

260
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:37,287
Dear residents of Tunas,
the judges in charge of this contest

261
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:41,041
have decided that, for the emergency test,

262
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,920
the contestants must show their skill

263
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,757
to hang on and secure themselves
in one of the toughest tests...

264
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,010
THE MECHANICAL BULL TEST

265
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,178
...the mechanical bull.

266
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:58,600
The four contestants who fall
to the ground the fastest

267
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,979
will be immediately disqualified.

268
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:05,774
The other two will go directly
into the final round

269
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:10,112
of the King of the Machos.
Let the test begin.

270
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:13,741
[crowd] One, two three...

271
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:19,663
Two, three, four...

272
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,165
- [alarm buzzes]
- [announcer] Ah, no way!

273
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:27,671
Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine...

274
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:33,969
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight...

275
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,306
[announcer] Oh, so sad!

276
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,977
[phone pings]

277
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:45,147
[crowd chants] León, León, León!

278
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:57,451
One, two, three, four,

279
00:17:57,534 --> 00:18:00,287
five, six, seven,

280
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:04,458
eight, nine, ten, eleven!

281
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,380
- Good.
- Good, León! Good!

282
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,432
[Abigail]
<i>On the bull, stay loose and go with it.</i>

283
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:23,435
<i>Your torso like a waving flag</i>

284
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,021
<i>and your hips
like you're caressing the bull.</i>

285
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:35,405
[crowd] Two, three, four, five,

286
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:39,743
- six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven!
- Fall already.

287
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:46,166
[announcer] Oh, no, no. This kid's
putting up some real competition, eh?

288
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,128
And, let's see. Uh... Ah...

289
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,463
Silence, please.
We have the results here for...

290
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:56,093
Oh, what a grand finale.
What a grand finale.

291
00:18:56,176 --> 00:19:01,557
With only 11 seconds, León Castillo
and Charly Tejeda are tied.

292
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:06,186
We have the final. Castillo versus Tejeda.

293
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,354
David versus Goliath.

294
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:17,823
You've got the green light.
Hey, and show no mercy.

295
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,501
Hey, Charly, my man.

296
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:33,255
Hey, dude, you rocked
that mechanical bull, eh?

297
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,173
Thanks.

298
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,757
Come on, get in. Want a few beers or what?

299
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,177
Sure.

300
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,056
Hell yeah, come on.

301
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,028
The thing about the mechanical bull
is that you have to be relaxed.

302
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,447
Because if your body is too tense,
then it won't work.

303
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,531
Yeah, dude.

304
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,408
I'd tell you that that's interesting,
but to be honest,

305
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:02,743
I don't give a fuck, asshole.

306
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,204
What's wrong with you?

307
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,790
What's wrong is that you're going
directly to hell, asshole.

308
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:09,917
The game's up for you.

309
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,503
Let's see if you finally fucking realize
that you make us all sick.

310
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,423
You're going to drop out of the contest,
you hear me?

311
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,887
And what if I don't?

312
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:25,432
This is what will happen to you,
fucking Charlota. [grunts]

313
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,310
[Charly grunting]

314
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,734
[grunting continues]

315
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,909
Are we clear? And one more thing.

316
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:48,330
If we see you near Abigail again,
you're dead, asshole.

317
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,334
Let's go.

318
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,527
- Eat, Dad.
- This is great, Mom.

319
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,780
- Made with lots of love.
- We know, sweetie.

320
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:24,574
[Ramón] Charly.

321
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,868
My God, Charly.

322
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:30,580
- What happened to you?
- What did they do to my son? [cries]

323
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,666
What did they do to you? Who was it?

324
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,168
God.

325
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,296
Let's see.

326
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,471
All done.

327
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,058
To top it all off, I fucked up with Toña.

328
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,770
And I only cause problems for all of you.

329
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:54,688
- No.
- No.

330
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,064
It's my fault they shut down the hostel.

331
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:59,651
Look, the hostel thing
will get sorted out sooner or later.

332
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,322
And well, bro, you knew what
you were getting into

333
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,115
when you signed up for the contest.

334
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,327
Obviously, in a town like this...

335
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,371
Well, they weren't going
to just let you win so easily.

336
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,457
The worst part of it is...

337
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:17,669
is that you believed the whole thing
about who is the most macho.

338
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,171
Why?

339
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:23,216
Because two or three dudes
cheered for you?

340
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,595
Since when did you become like them?

341
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,264
You're not like that.

342
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:36,313
Look, bro,
we're always going to support you.

343
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,397
Yes.

344
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,274
Always.

345
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,360
But you have to keep being yourself.

346
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,112
I think that what's most important now,

347
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,864
with everything that's happened,

348
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,575
is for you to let go of your ego

349
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,327
and drop out of the competition.

350
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:57,918
[grunts]

351
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:03,840
No.

352
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,342
I can't do that.

353
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:09,388
If I drop out now,
I have no way to teach the people

354
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:12,224
how fucking toxic this contest is.

355
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:20,190
Mom. I'm sorry for behaving like an idiot.

356
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:22,067
No. It's done now.

357
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,362
Dad, you were right.

358
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,031
I should have listened to you.

359
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:29,783
Forgive me.

360
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,288
I...

361
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:37,624
I know that I messed up.

362
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,420
But please give me the chance
to make things right.

363
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:44,214
[cries]

364
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:49,886
Okay.

365
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,270

Truly.

380
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,987
I really fucked up with you, Antonia.

381
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,448
You don't know how much I regret it.

382
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:37,869
And you still helped me. You were there.

383
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:39,871
Without your advice,

384
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,708
I would have fallen off
the mechanical bull within two seconds.

385
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:48,547
But you still kept acting
like an imbecile.

386
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,258
It's like you never learn, dude.

387
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:55,345
Then you started acting like a macho.

388
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:58,181
Look, honestly, you seemed pathetic.

389
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:04,980
I know. Forgive me.

390
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,149
But, well...

391
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:11,069
With that serenade,

392
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,780
and if you try a little harder,

393
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:16,074
you may find
that I've already forgiven you.

394
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,368
Really?

395
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:25,083
Oh! I hate being mad at you.

396
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:30,046
But I don't love that Charly.

397
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,631
I love the real one.

398
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:34,968
Not that Charly you turned into
to please everyone else.

399
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:37,637
I promise.

400
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:40,807
And I want to promise you
that I'll always be here for you.

401
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:47,689
You know, it just so happens
that my mom made enchiladas today.

402
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:51,943
- Wanna go eat?
- That sounds incredible.

403
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:55,697
But there's something I need to fix first.

404
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:01,995
You make me very happy.

405
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:03,747
Back atcha.

406
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,831
[Charly] Bye.

407
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:20,555
What the hell are you doing here?
Get lost.

408
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:24,184
Or what? Are you going to send
those assholes to beat me up again?

409
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:28,063
What? I don't know what the hell
you're talking about, asshole.

410
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:32,567
Oh, no? So then, you also don't know
what happened to the hostel, right?

411
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,319
I don't have anything
to do with that, dude.

412
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:36,154
Don't act stupid, León.

413
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:37,656
Look, idiot. Just so you know,

414
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,950
my dad found out about you and Abi
and he's beyond furious.

415
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:43,078
Knowing him, I'm sure it was him.

416
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,247
And be grateful you got off so easily,
asshole, because my sister didn't.

417
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,376
Why? Is she okay?

418
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,294
Stay away from her.

419
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:55,298
Just tell her that I came to see her.
That's it.

420
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,093
You and I will meet in the finale.

421
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:03,848
You have no fucking clue what's at stake
for me in this contest, asshole.

422
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:06,935
I need to win to get out
of this fucking town.

423
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,358
I understand
because I want the same thing.

424
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,320
And because I saw
what your dad does to you.

425
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:20,281
What the hell are you talking about?

426
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:24,619
That it's not okay that he beats you.

427
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,333
The one who should feel ashamed is him.

428
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:33,878
It's not your fault, León.

429
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:43,555
No. No, you're wrong.
I don't want anything to do with you.

430
