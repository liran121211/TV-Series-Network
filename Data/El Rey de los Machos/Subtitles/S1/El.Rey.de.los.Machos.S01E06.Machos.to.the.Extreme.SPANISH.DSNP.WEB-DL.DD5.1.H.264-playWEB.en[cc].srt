[merchant] Five pesos.
[speaks indistinctly]

4
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:08,466
Five bucks, five bucks,
you pay five bucks.

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,677
It's yours for five bucks.

6
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,930
[merchant 2] Okay, blondie, so should I
give you this King of the Machos one?

7
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,433
[buyer] Look, you know what?
I'll take two T-shirts

8
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,685
and give me the orange hat,
but the one with Charly on it, eh?

9
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:20,979
- [merchant 2] You got it. Here you go.
- [buyer] Okay.

10
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:24,149
- Thanks. Take care.
- [merchant 2] You're welcome. Thank you.

11
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,278
Give me that T-shirt.

12
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,655
- [merchant 2] The blue one?
- Yes, please.

13
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,116
- I'll give it to you right now.
- Yes, and, um...

14
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:34,409
It's quite nice, eh?

15
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:36,578
And... and this hat, please.

16
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:38,455
This one. Perfect.

17
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:41,666
Check out how nice these turned out, eh?
They're really good quality.

18
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,794
And just between us,
Charly's always been my pick.

19
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,379
- No way.
- Yes.

21
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,106
{\an8}Dad, can you hand me the other brush?

22
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,696
{\an8}Okay, enough, yeah? How much longer
are you going to stay mad at me?

23
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:14,866
{\an8}What you did wasn't right, Charly.

24
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,993
{\an8}And that's why I already said sorry.

25
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,831
{\an8}- [horse whinnies]
- I'm sorry, Mom.

26
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,877
{\an8}Don't even worry about it.

27
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:30,173
{\an8}At least your friends enjoyed
the molito I made.

28
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:38,765
{\an8}Okay, and FYI, I was just following
your advice to go after my dreams, eh?

29
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,851
{\an8}And part of going after your dreams is
making friends with that guy?

30
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,561
{\an8}No, my dream is to get out of this hole,

31
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,272
{\an8}and the mayor is the only one
who can help me with that.

32
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:55,824
{\an8}That's why I'm telling you that
you really have to watch your step, Son.

[Lázaro] That's how I wanted to find you,
wasting time.

41
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:49,127
Tell me, why didn't you go out
with the foreman to the agave field?

42
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,712
[stammers] Dad, I forgot. I'm sorry.

43
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:51,921
You forgot?

44
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,007
If you don't even learn about agave,

45
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,719
how are you going to avoid looking
like an idiot for the rest of your life?

46
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:00,555
Well, okay, I'll tell Mr. Mario
to give me the tour. That's enough.

47
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,265
Don't tell me to shut up.

48
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:05,894
I need a man here, a man to take this on!

49
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,562
And you need to learn, asshole!

50
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:12,817
Don't make me, or the foreman, or anyone,

51
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,612
anyone else waste our time, you dumbass!

52

Where are you going? Where are you going?

53
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,867
- Come here, you son of a bitch.
- [belt whips]

54
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,078
- [Lázaro] Are you a man, or not?
- [León groans] I'm a real man, Dad.

55
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:28,291
[Lázaro] Are you a man, or not?
You dumbass!

- Are you going to understand, or not?
- [León groans]

59
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,259
[Lázaro] Do we agree, asshole?
Or else it'll get worse for you!

60
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:41,679
This is how you learn, dumbass,
because you're a dumbass!

61
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,181
I want you to be a man,

62
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:45,558
- not a little fag! Let's go!
- What are you doing here?

63
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,018
- [belt whips]
- I was waiting for you,

64
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,686
- and I heard a noise...
- [Abi] It's normal.

65
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,730
- It always happens.
- [Lázaro] Learn, you dumbass!

66
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,941
- Nothing! That's it, cry like a bitch!
- Let's go.

67
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,067
- No, Abi, how...?
- Let's go.

68

- No, Abi.

Look. The first one, the first one.

Ah, that's it! [chuckles]

00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:20,969
Eh? It's like that.

78
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,595
- Like that.
- [chuckles]

00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:26,724
- [sighs]
- [Abi] What's up? This is Charly.

Cat got your tongues, or what? Say hello.

82
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,315
- What's up?
- [Charly] What's up?

83
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,360
What? Are you gonna join
our pickup matches too, or what?

84
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:40,154
In this town,
we men all know how to shoot, right?

85
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,657
- Leave him alone, Jaco.
- [Jaco scoffs]

86
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,117
It's fine, Abi.

87
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,035
You don't have to do it
if you don't want to.

88
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,537
Yeah, if you don't want to, eh?

I can give you some tips later.

- Yeah, go on.

95

- [Jaco's friend] Okay, Jaco, show him.
- You did great.

96
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:23,990
Thanks.

Ooh! What happened, my Jaco?

98
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,538
Don't get nervous, Jaco.

99
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:32,749

00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,118
I mean, in addition to all of this,

106
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,913
I obviously have lots of bros
who owe me a lot of favors.

Mr. Mayor, how may we help you?

114

No, nothing, nothing.
Nothing, Mr. Tejeda, mmm?

115
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,517
I actually just came to give Charly
a few things that I'd promised him.

116

But, well, that's it.

- See you tomorrow, champion, eh?
- [chuckles]

118
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,438
- Rest well so you can sock it to 'em.
- For sure.

119

- Thanks a lot.
- Yeah, no worries.

- Have a good evening.

I just don't like that guy.

124
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:52,620
He's my friend, Dad. He just wants
to help me get into a good school.

125
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:53,996
No, Son. No, man.

126
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,416
[chuckles] No, forget about that.
He's not your friend.

127
00:06:57,041 --> 00:07:00,044
All that kind of person is looking for is
to get themselves ahead.

128
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,589
And if that were true,
what's it to you, eh?

129
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:06,592
Or what? Are you going to pay
for my college education?

to start supporting the next champion.

When are you going to wear the T-shirt
with the next winner on it?

<i>Don't be too sure of yourself,
because today's gonna be really tough, eh?</i>

No, no. You relax, I'll be nervous.

00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:28,299
Kid, since I feel
like you're part of this family,

155
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,635
I've got another gift for you, mmm?

00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,433
Make my granddaughter Carlota proud.

158
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,228
[Charly] Thanks a lot, Grandpa.
This... this is going to help me a lot.

- Bye, Son.

00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,696
- Bye.
- Lots.

If you weren't such a fucking slacker,
none of this would've happened.

166
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:59,121
Do you think I like
going around beating you up?

167
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,170
You're pretty stupid, eh?

168
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:34,824
- [folk music playing]
- [people cheering, laughing]

169
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,416
[cheering]

170
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:44,709
THE KING OF THE MACHOS

171
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:45,668
[photographer] Smile.

172
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,421
{\an8}ARE YOU THE MOST MACHO?
GIVE IT A TRY!!!

173
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,631
- Go ahead.
- No, you gotta be kidding, my good man.

174
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,675
No, no, no. Please, go ahead, go ahead.

175
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,635
Make my day.

176
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,846
[chuckles] All right.
Can you hold this for me?

177
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,681
[chuckles]

178
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,440
That wasn't bad.

179
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:15,865
[bell dings]

180
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,700
[spectators cheer]

181
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,997
Oh, well, my good man. I smoked you.

182
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,248
[chuckles]

183
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,542
And my son's gonna do the same
to your little girl.

184
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,465
And before the most extreme test begins,

185
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:36,344
we're here with an exclusive interview
with Chilín González,

186
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,596
who's going to tell us about his journey.

187
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,848
And, tell us, Chilín,
how long have you been...

188
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:41,932
One moment.

189
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:49,690
Welcome to this big day,
dear residents of Tunas.

190
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,652
Let's start today's test

191
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:56,781
by calling our nine macho hopefuls
into the ring.

192
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,074
Come on in, please.

193
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,284
Let's have a big round of applause!
Let's hear it!

194
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:03,245
The contestants will have to take on the
forces of nature,

195
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:07,667
equipped only with their map and
other tools we've allowed them to have.

196
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:11,087
[Joel] Congrats. Very good, very good.

197
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,256
Their goal is to capture the flag
that's their assigned color...

198
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,300
[León] Stop looking at me,
fucking Charlota.

199
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:19,095
What? What's wrong, León Castillo?

200
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,138
I wanted to ask the committee
if it'd be possible

201
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,557
to change Carlota's bandanna
to a pink one.

202
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,143
- I mean, given the circumstances, right?
- [spectators laughing]

203
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:29,271
- Boo!
- [spectators booing]

204
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,441
[Miriam] Hey, shh, no, no. Quiet, please.

205
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,568
Show some respect, if you'd be so kind.

206
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,405
Everybody, quiet, please.

207
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:44,954
We will now search the backpacks
to make sure no one is cheating.

208
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,372
Sir, please. Mr. Víctor.

209
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:49,792
Okay, we're looking. We're looking, guys.
Just in case.

210
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,752
- See? There's nothing.
- That's it. Great, great.

211
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,255
- I don't have anything in there.
- Excellent. All right, let's see.

212
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,799
Ah, some water, great.

213
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,801
Let go, let go, boy. Let go.

214
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:04,181
[sighs] Mrs. Miriam,
something is off here.

215
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,684
- What? What is that? [laughs]
- What is that? What is that?

216
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,353
- [Víctor] No, we can't have that.
- [Joel] Telésforo brought a teddy bear.

217
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,814
[Miriam] That's not allowed. No, no way.
No. Look... Look, look.

218
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,983
[León] Probably packed her skirt.

219
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,109
Shut up already.

220
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,947
- [Joel as teddy bear] Goodbye.
- [laughing]

221
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,450
Do you think this challenge will be easy?

222
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:25,119
- [spectators] No, no, no.
- No, it won't be.

223
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:29,790
The participants will face
nature's hidden forces

224
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,835
in order to capture their flag.

225
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:37,840
Once they have their flag in hand,
they'll have to get out of awful

226
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,843
and dangerous natural obstacles
to reach the finish line.

227
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,429
Charly, I'm so excited.
Can I have your autograph?

228
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:44,638
- My pleasure.
- Thank you.

229
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,265
We're superfans, eh?

230
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:49,059
[Miriam] We'll confirm and certify
that they crossed the finish line

231
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,020
with their assigned flag.

232
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,855
Now we'll check their backpacks...

233
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,065
- Want me to personalize it for you?
- Please.

234
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:56,942
That's gross, Charly.

235
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,862
- [Miriam] Mr. Víctor, please. Víctor.
- Thank you.

236
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,155
- [Charly] Thanks a lot.
- Good luck.

237
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:02,323
See you at the finish line.

238
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:06,744
[Miriam] Are you ready?
Break a leg, my brave ones!

239
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:13,083
And on your mark, get set, go!

240
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,543
[spectators cheering]

241
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,212
FINISH

242
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,381
[cheers]

243
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,550
THE EXTREME MACHO TEST

244
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,029
[Mario] Let it go, asshole.

245
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:43,322
Okay, it's yours.

246
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:45,825
[pants]

247
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:54,500
{\an8}I'LL FOR SURE
GO TO WAR WITH YOU

248
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:25,865
[whimpering]

249
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,028
[shrieks]

250
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,047
Oh, no.

251
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,924
[birds squawking]

252
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,008
Shh!

253
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:10,219
[Charly] Fucking...

254
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:13,973
Fucking map, it's wrong!

255
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:17,935
[sighs]

256
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,023
[pants]

257
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:30,322
[teacher] Great,
now we rub on the needle really hard.

258
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,574
Be careful, don't prick yourselves.

259
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:37,079
Once it's ready, we take a dry leaf...

260
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:45,212
we set it down...
and we place our needle on it.

261
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:49,550
And this will show us the way. See that?

262
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:35,846
[kissing] Ah, you like
being in control, eh? [kisses]

263
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,237
[panting]

264
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:57,242
No, shit, a fucking river. [groans, pants]

265
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,506
Now we have to see
how we'll cross this fucking river.

266
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:14,551
Wait.

267
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,346
Why is mine different?

268
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,264
Give me my map, idiot.

269
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,476
All of the maps are supposed to be
the same. Why is mine different?

270
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,144
I don't know
what you're talking about, idiot.

271
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,729
You swapped mine out.
Didn't you, you idiot?

272
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:26,897
I didn't do anything, Charlota.

273
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,107
You're a fucking cheater, León!

274
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,691
Look, you dumbass...

275
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,323
Charly! Charly, I don't know how to swim!

276
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,577
- Charly!
- Grab onto the stick, dude!

277
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:43,122
- Charly!
- Dog paddle, dude, dog paddle!

278
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:46,208
- Charly!
- Hold on!

279
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,963
- Try to grab the stick!
- Charly!

280
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,466
Help me! Charly!

281
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,971
[panting]

282
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:01,932
- Calm down! Don't pull on my shoulder!
- I can't!

283
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,897
[panting]

284
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,149
You're drowning me!

285
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,582
[Charly coughing]

286
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,794
[León panting]

287
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:34,923
- [straining, panting]
- [panting]

288
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,637
[pants]

289
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,725
You're a piece of shit! For real!

290
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,518
[coughs]

291
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,147
[screams]

292
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,071
Ladies don't drink.

293
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,240
Yes, Dad.

294
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,998
He's taking a while.

295
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,836
Do you want to have a beer with me?

296
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:18,133
No, Toñita. I get buzzed very quickly.
It's embarrassing.

297
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:21,428
You have it, you need it. Mmm? Drink up.

298
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:22,471
Why do you say that?

299
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:25,766
You don't look good.

300
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,435
[spectator] The first guy's here,
the first guy's here!

301
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:29,519
[spectators clamoring]

302
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,610
[spectator yells, laughs]
Here he comes! [laughs]

303
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:40,447
[Miriam] Here comes
our first macho hopeful. And it's...

304
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,366
- Who is it? I can't see anything.
- [Joel] It's Jesús!

305
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:43,825
- [Víctor] Jesús, Jesús!
- [Miriam] Jesús!

306
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,994
[Víctor] Jesús! Let's have
a big round of applause for Jesús.

307
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,788
[Miriam] I don't have
my glasses. Congratulations!

308
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:51,250
[Joel] Congratulations, kid! Very good!
First place, first place!

309
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:55,003
Can you believe that scrawny kid beat
your dumbass brother?

310
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,882
All León does is humiliate me.

311
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:02,719
- [Víctor] There he is, look!
- [Miriam] Yes! Telésforo!

312
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,596
[Víctor] Telésforo!
Great that you made it, kid, eh?

313
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,223
[Joel] Great that you made it.

314
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:07,808
Give it to him already. Let it go.

315
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:28,620
[Víctor] Let's go, Fidel! Keep going.
Go on, go on. Go on, go on!

316
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,289
- [Joel] Come on, come on,
- [air horn blasts]

317
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,707
- [Miriam] Fidel!
- [Víctor] Fidel,

318
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,167
ladies and gentlemen! Fidel! [chuckles]

319
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:37,587
- Fidel! Stop running!
- Come on, come on! That's it!

320
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,506
[laughs]

321
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:45,137
Ah, here comes someone else!
Who is it? There he is! Who is it?

322
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,272
- [shouting] Eh?
- [cheering]

323
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:57,190
- That's right!
- [spectators cheering]

324
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,943
[gasps] Charly! Ah! [laughs]
Charly! That's awesome! Charly!

325
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,028
- Yes! [laughs]
- [shouts]

326
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:04,823
Charly Tejeda moves on to the next round!

327
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:08,493
Charly, you made it! [laughs]

328
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,871
[Miriam] Charly Tejeda moves on
to the next round!

329
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:11,955
Great! Great!

330
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,249
That's great, Charly. That's great, Son.

331
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,417
- Always!
- [groans]

332
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,668
I knew you could do it!

333
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,588
- You had us on pins and needles.
- No way. How'd you do it?

334
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,346
I couldn't have done
any of this without you.

335
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:30,807
I know.

336
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:36,271
[Miriam] Our macho hopeful
in fifth place is León,

337
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,981
who moves on to the next round.

338
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,816
No! Don't be down!
Fifth place ain't bad, León!

339
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,901
Ooh, ooh!

340
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:46,365
[shrieks, laughs] Way to go! How was it?

341
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:47,741
[León] Good, but it was fucking hard.

342
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:50,285
[friend] Good, dude, good. You did well.
No problem. You're doing well.

343
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,997
- No, I mean, it's hard.
- [speaks indistinctly]

344
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,553
Who'd you say was going to smoke whom?

345
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:10,972
[chuckles]

346
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:17,562
[sobbing] How the fuck
did I make it, dude?

347
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,731
[Inés] And we're here
with the most extremely macho

348
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,024
of all extremely macho guys.

349
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,777
{\an8}<i>Jesús "The Bicep" Fernández, who won
today's test at The King of the Machos.</i>

350
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,904
{\an8}FIRST-PLACE WINNER
OF THE EXTREME MACHO TEST

351
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:28,657
{\an8}<i>Jesús is going to tell us what he felt
as he went into the abyss</i>

352
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,118
{\an8}<i>that is the jungle
of San José de las Tunas.</i>

353
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:34,204
{\an8}<i>What he felt as he saw
his life flash before his eyes.</i>

354
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:35,163
{\an8}<i>Jesús.</i>

355
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,665
{\an8}- <i>For me...</i>
- <i>One second, one second. Shh.</i>

356
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,543
{\an8}<i>Eh, eh? They're telling me
we're out of time.</i>

357
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:42,838
{\an8}<i>I'm sorry, dear viewers.
For Tuna TV, Inés Montoya.</i>

358
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,674
It smells very good, honey. Eh?

359
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:46,883
- Yes.
- It really does smell good.

360
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,176
- Pour me a little soda.
- [stammers]

361
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,970
- It's ready, eh?
- Today is a special night, right?

362
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,721
- Daughter...
- [Alonso] Mmm?

363
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:53,723
- [whispering] Now.
- Son.

364
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:54,808
Louder.

365
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:57,978
Charly! Time for dinner!

366
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:01,398
- [Pepe] Is Carlota coming?
- [Alonso, whispering] I'll explain later.

367
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,525
Son. Have a seat.

368
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,654
I'll serve you. But first...

369
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,531
[chuckles]

370
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:17,080
What's this?

371
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,165
Open it.

372
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:30,093
What is this?

373
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,471
I thought you might need some underwear.

374
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:35,557
Oh, you gotta be kidding, Mom. I don't
wear these. Not even if I were a stripper.

375
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,186
- Mmm. Okay. [chuckles] I'll go get dinner.
- [Alonso] Yeah.

376
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:42,898
Eat what they made you for dinner
so you'll get strong, bro.

377
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:43,982
It smells good, doesn't it?

378
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,358
- [whispering] For sure.
- [Charly] Yes.

379
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,277
[Pepe] Mmm.
My granddaughter is coming soon, eh?

380
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,947
Mmm!

381
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,742
- Please. [chuckles]
- Charly first.

382
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:55,494
Seriously?

383
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,204
Chicken soup?

384
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:01,458
I go all day without eating,
to the point where I practically fainted.

385
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:03,251
And you come out here with chicken soup?

386
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,337
Uh...

387
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:09,090
[inhales deeply] There's other stuff.
We have snacks too.

388
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:11,259
I'd be better off buying some street food.

389
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,762
Hey, tone it down.
You're crossing the line.

390
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:17,307
You can act like that with other people,
but not here at home.

391
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,850
I won't allow you to,
do you understand me?

392
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,120
[Abi] Hi, handsome.

393
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:42,874
- Do you want a ride?
- Please.

394
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:48,964
[kisses]

395
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:52,133
- Ready?
- Ready.

396
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:53,677
Where are you gonna take me?

397
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,220
- Wherever you'd like.
- [laughs]

398
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,898
It's like my family doesn't know me.

399
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:11,570
It's like they don't understand
the effort I've put in to get here.

400
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:15,615
You're doing amazing,
and not just in the contest.

401
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:18,910
What you're doing for the town is badass.

402
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,913
A lot of people are coming
to their senses, thanks to you.

403
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:24,708
At least I have you.

404
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,168
- Yes.
- Yes.

405
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,630
[kissing]

406
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:36,970
[sighs]

407
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:40,807
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine. I'm just not ready.

408
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,019
Are we good?

409
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:45,895
Is it okay?

410
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,731
It's okay.

411
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:48,815
- Yes.
- Yes.

412
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:53,361
[kissing]

413
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:02,537
BETO'S TACOS

414
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:20,180
I don't know how to put this, you...

415
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:22,891
You can't imagine
what I'm seeing right now.
