1
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:04,129
- [Charly] It's bent already.
- [Alonso laughs]

2
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:05,880
Don't worry. Look, I'll show you.

3
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:09,009
But pay close attention, eh?
Because this is a matter of practice.

4
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:11,219
If you want to hammer
a nail the right way,

5
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:14,764
you need to do a lever motion
with your forearm, not just your wrist.

6
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:17,934
And then just strike it once, boom!

7
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,311
Ah, right? [laughs] Do you want to try it?

8
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:21,646
- Let's see.
- Go for it.

9
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:27,819
- [hammer thuds]
- Ooh, ooh, ooh.

10
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:31,740
[chuckles] Well, little by little, right?
Practice makes perfect, don't worry.

11
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:33,700
Do you want to try again? Go for it.

12
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:35,452
Yes. Okay, okay.

13
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,661
You can do it.

14
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,665
- Very good, very good.
- Yeah? [giggles]

15
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:42,083
You did great.

16
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,110
[rooster crows]

17
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:16,367
THE KING OF THE MACHOS

18
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,287
{\an8}[Antonia] Go ahead.

19
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,538
{\an8}Is this for real?

20
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:23,833
{\an8}Of course.
And don't, don't, don't make that face.

21
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,877
{\an8}You know who used to
eat this for breakfast?

22
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,713
{\an8}El Perro Aguayo,
and look how far that guy got.

23
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,006
{\an8}I'm really happy for him.

24
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,257
{\an8}Bon appétit, Charly.

25
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,802
{\an8}Much respect, Charly.
Now you've really got balls.

26
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,386
{\an8}Mmm. Thanks.

27
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:39,099
{\an8}Wow, my friend,
your social really is on fire now.

28
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:41,184
{\an8}[clears throat]

29
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,646
{\an8}By the power vested in me
by my experience as an influencer,

30
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:49,275
{\an8}I declare myself your PR rep, your coach,
and your community manager.

31
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,819
{\an8}- Calm down, influencer.
- Nice to meet you.

32
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:54,155
{\an8}Charly, from now on,
it's all about managing your fame.

33
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,658
{\an8}- What are you talking about, dude?
- Are you ready?

34
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,500
{\an8}berean

35
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,293
{\an8}- It's okay to be surprised.
- Not bad at all.

36
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:10,547
{\an8}Not bad, but don't look at it too much
because you'll get distracted.

37
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,091
{\an8}- Eat breakfast.
- Oh, I'm not going to eat this.

38
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,260
{\an8}You're shitting me,
what's wrong with people?

39
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:17,554
{\an8}I don't get why they're following
this freak.

40
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,181
{\an8}Oh, are you stalking her?
Do you like her, or what, man?

41
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,558
{\an8}No way, what's up with you?

42
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:22,934
{\an8}Look, dude, chill.

43
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:25,270
{\an8}A macho proves himself in the ring,
not on socials.

44
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:28,648
{\an8}Hey, take a fucking picture of me. Do it.

45
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,942
{\an8}- Look, right here. Here.
- [friend] Let's see.

46
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:33,611
{\an8}- [exhales deeply] That's it.
- Come on, León.

47
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:34,696
{\an8}There you go.

48
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:36,823
- Hey, show off your bicep more.
- How, like this?

49
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,741
All right, there it is. Okay, another one.

50
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,702
- Show off your bicep more. That's it.
- Like this?

51
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:42,078
That's it. Good, champion.

52
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,163
MACHO

53
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:46,624
I've always dreamed of leaving this town
and seeing what's out there.

54
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,210
- Uh, meeting new people...
- That's obviously what you have to do

55
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:55,758
because, I don't know, small-town life
for someone as special as you?

56
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:59,512
Honestly that's way, way below you. Right?

57
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,849
I mean, your parents lead
a very, very, very dignified life.

58
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,602
But I see you doing something...

59
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:09,272
- bigger.
- Yes, that's precisely why I signed up

60
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,440
for the contest.

61
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:13,818
Because, if I win, I can use
the prize money to go study in the city.

62
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:16,905
And plus, you're so smart. Wow.

63
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,740
And what do you want to study?

64
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,450
I'm thinking about sociology.

65
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,619
- No. Wow.
- [laughs] Yes.

66
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:26,372
That sounds super... interesting, right?

67
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,457
It is.

68
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,417
I just got a thought.

69
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,879
When I'm governor,

70
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:37,050
I'll pay
for your entire college education.

71
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,761
- [laughs]
- Are you serious?

72
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:41,930
Yes. Oof.

73
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:45,934
Mr. Mayor, you have no idea
how much that means to me.

74
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:50,480
But look, the first thing you need to do
is stop calling me "Mr. Mayor."

75
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,815
- [chuckles]
- It's Jerónimo, okay?

76
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,360
- Jerónimo.
- [laughs] Better, better.

77
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,695
- [knocking on door]
- Come in! Come in!

78
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,781
- Excuse me, eh?
- [chuckles] No.

79
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:00,949
What's up, my Mayor?

80
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,284
I wanted to let you know that
the personal ass-istants are ready.

81
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,119
[stammers, sighs]

82
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:08,122
[groans] Mini-Johnny, that's bad.

83
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:12,085
No, no, no, don't use that language.
When? When? That's really bad.

84
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:14,504
You know what?
Go wash your mouth out with soap.

85
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:17,507
- Since when did that change here, or what?
- Get out!

86
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,009
- Okay.
- [Jerónimo chuckles]

87
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,929
- [chuckles]
- [exhales] Forgive me, eh?

88
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:25,139
But we've had some staff problems.

89
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,641
[gasps] I got it.

90
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:28,226
Today is your lucky day

91
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:31,354
because I'm going to show you
a day in the life of Jerónimo Navarro.

92
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,189
Like how they used to do on TV.

93
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,109
You know, those music video channels?
One day with a superstar.

94
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,778
- I'd love that. Yes, of course.
- Yeah, no, it's super '90s,

95
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,655
like the music video channel.
Do you remember?

96
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:42,282
- [laughs]
- Well, no, how could you remember?

97
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,951
But anyway, I feel like a star, more...

98
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:48,538
Good afternoon, good afternoon,
beautiful people, eh?

99
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,623
Doña Lucy, I'll come get the tunas later.

100
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:51,833
[laughs]

101
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,752
Everyone is turning to look at you
because we're famous, eh?

102
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,671
- [chuckles]
- You need to get used to that.

103
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,674
- Good morning, good morning.
- [villager] Good morning.

104
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:01,926
How are we? How are we?
How are we doing, kids?

105
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,095
- [villager] Good, good.
- [Jerónimo chuckles]

106
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:06,472
- [Ponciano] Mr. Jerónimo Navarro.
- [Jerónimo] Mm-hmm.

107
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:10,518
What are you doing with this... thing?

108
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:13,771
[scoffs] Hey, hey, hey.
Be respectful, please.

109
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:18,109
His name is Charly and he is my friend,
and he deserves our utmost respect, eh?

110
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,902
But watch out, Mr. Jerónimo,

111
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:23,489
don't catch whatever illness
your little friend is suffering from.

112
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:24,866
[both snicker]

113
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:28,953
All I have that can rub off on you is
my charisma and good looks.

114
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,747
- No, man.
- [Jerónimo chuckles]

115
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,374
That's why we're friends, Charly, eh?

116
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,625
Excuse me.

117
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:38,004
Those hicks don't know a thing, dude,
but later...

118
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,342
What do you think?

119
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,512
Do you think he's a fag?

120
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:47,889
No.

121
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,015
All right.

122
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,850
[chuckles] Hello, hello.

123
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:51,934
Hey.

124
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,520
That's how you blow people away, eh?

125
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:57,273
You need to carry yourself
like in the old-time movies.

126
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:01,069
The drinks here are so-so,
but the hot girls are the best in town.

127
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:03,404
Charly, what a nice coincidence.

128
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:06,032
- Good afternoon, Mr. Jerónimo.
- Inesita.

129
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:08,868
Hey, it's a godsend
to run into you two here.

130
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:12,705
Would you mind if I try to do
a little, short, quick interview?

131
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,666
- [chuckles] Honestly...
- Anything for you, anything for you.

132
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,752
- Of course, of course.
- It'll be really casual. Relax.

133
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,045
- Really casual.
- Arturo!

134
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:20,296
[Arturo sighs]

135
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:24,175
- [camera beeps]
- Good afternoon, dear viewers.

136
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:29,680
I'm Inés Montoya and I'm here with
our distinguished mayor, Jerónimo Navarro.

137
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:32,517
But we also have
the pleasant surprise of having

138
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,520
none other than Charly Tejeda
with us as well.

139
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:36,604
[chuckles] Hello.

140
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,607
[Inés] Mr. Mayor,
at the last King of the Machos test,

141
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:43,069
you surprised all of us
by publicly supporting Charly,

142
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:46,864
the first and only trans contestant
in San José de las Tunas' history.

143
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:50,368
Can you explain the reasoning
behind your sudden decision?

144
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:53,830
Well, Inesita, first off, uh,

145
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:57,458
<i>well, yes, perhaps people at home
were surprised.</i>

146
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:02,255
But normal the truth is my heart
has always supported diversification.

147
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:03,714
[Charly chuckles]

148
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,800
[whispers] Diversity. Diversity.

149
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,761
[chuckles]
You can edit that, right? Later.

150
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:12,932
<i>Since we're in front of the camera,
I want to take this opportunity to say</i>

151
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:16,936
<i>that these... these, uh, tribes
will be protected when I'm governor.</i>

152
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,938
Oh, wow, that's quite a revelation.

153
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,857
And not just that, eh?

154
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,943
Our state has lagged behind in many ways,

155
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:27,321
<i>and then along came Charly.
Just look at that face.</i>

156
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:30,908
He's driven, eager to change things.

157
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,827
<i>And so I said, "Of course, of course.</i>

158
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:36,747
<i>San José de las Tunas is
as ready as any cosmopolitan city</i>

159
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:41,627
<i>to embrace their gays,
their... their... lesbians, their things."</i>

160
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,505
<i>I'm not a thing, I'm trans.</i>

161
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,634
Trans. Yeah.

162
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:52,513
And tell us, when are you planning to
launch your campaign for governor?

163
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:56,225
Oh, look, Inesita, honestly,
you're putting me a bit on the spot,

164
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,936
but my wife... [chuckles] ...can hardly wait.

165
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,736
The next test is coming up.
How exciting, baby.

166
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,947
- Yeah, well, but...
- But what, baby?

167
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,658
The issue is that
the next test will be in teams.

168
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,995
They're going to draw names soon
to see who we're matched with.

169
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,371
[parent] Well, good luck, baby.

170
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,458
Dad, uh...

171
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:24,295
I was thinking that, I don't know,
maybe you could help with the drawing

172
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:27,006
so that the best contestants
are on my team.

173
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:30,843
Are you scared that lesbian
will end up on your team?

174
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,553
No, no, no, no, not at all.

175
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:36,516
But... but I don't want to lose.
And I'm sure she will make her team lose.

176
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,977
Well, it was your dumbass mistake
that got us into this,

177
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,687
so let's see how you'll get us out.

178
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,733
And be careful not to fuck it up again.

179
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,156
Do you want some whiskey, love?

180
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,200
What I want is for you
to stop calling him "baby."

181
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,701
That's what I want, starting now.

182
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:03,543
Imagine that, Toña.

183
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,253
He wants to pay for
my entire college education.

184
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,672
With that money, we can rent an apartment

185
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:10,800
and you'd only have to worry
about paying for college expenses.

186
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,303
What do you think? Can you believe it?

187
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,471
[chuckles]

188
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,975
No, it sounds too good to be true.

189
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:21,852
Plus...

190
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:26,732
Charly, I don't know if it's cool for you
to be going around with the mayor.

191
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:28,859
It's weird, don't you think?

192
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,528
You're kidding, Toña.

193
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,822
You're the one who said that
I had to take advantage of fame,

194
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,156
and that's what I'm doing.

195
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,411
[sighs] Look, I'm late for the drawing.
See you later.

196
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,165
DAMSEL IN DISTRESS

197
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,334
[Joel] Distinguished
and handsome young men,

198
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:50,172
we are going to randomly draw three groups

199
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:56,095
of three participants each
to compete in the next round.

200
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:59,724
So, let's go to the raffle.
Drum, drum, drum.

201
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,018
No bias here, I'm totally neutral!

202
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,604
May God share the luck between you, guys.

203
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:10,359
And the members of the first team will be...

204
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,195
Javier!

205
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,698
Fidel!

206
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,992
Mario!

207
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,118
[laughs]

208
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:22,955
And the second team will be made up of...

209
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,541
León!

210
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,836
[chuckles] Santiago!

211
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,546
- [laughs]
- [Joel] Oh, I'm so nervous.

212
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,174
And the third will be... Dun, dun, dun, dun...

213
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:35,801
- [gasps, laughs]
- [Joel laughs]

214
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,762
Charly!

215
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,889
[laughs]

216
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,808
The third team will be made up
of everyone else, okay?

217
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,894
Get started, then. [chuckles]

218
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,396
We're not going to plan
any strategy or anything?

219
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,441
All I'm gonna say, Charlota,
is that no girl is gonna make me lose.

220
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,610
So, you'd better bring it, eh?

221
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:55,529
Just so you know,
I'm just as manly as any of you.

222
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,740
Stop with the bullshit.
A woman is a woman,

223
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,534
and no matter how much you'd like to,
it's impossible to become a guy.

224
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:03,204
Whatever you say, León, but I'm going
to show you that I'm more macho

225
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,664
than you and your dad combined.

226
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,877
The girlie got mad.

227
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,212
Cut it out.

228
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,932
[rooster crows]

229
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,518
[phone chimes]

230
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:33,317
- [rooster crows]
- [grunts]

231
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,995
[rooster crows]

232
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:51,377
{\an8}See you where we left off?

233
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:57,508
{\an8}Ok!

234
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,556
- Yes, and I want León's to be yellow.
- Mm-hmm.

235
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:04,640
Yes.

236
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:08,519
Honestly, that little dance Carlota did
at the last test was ridiculous.

237
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:09,603
It was awful.

238
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,522
What were the steps? Oh, it was...

239
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:15,484
[all laugh]

240
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,404
Oh, it was so low-class.

241
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,740
Well, I thought the dance was fun.

242
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,241
- No.
- No.

243
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,452
Carlota is nothing more
than a circus attraction.

244
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:27,580
She's... she's like, uh,
like the bearded lady.

245
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:30,416
- But she wishes she had a beard.
- [laughs]

246
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,377
At least he's not a caveman,

247
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:36,589
like the other guys
who only have brute strength.

248
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,426
And his name is Charly.

249
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,262
My son's name is Charly.

250
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,978
And by the way, he's winning the contest.

251
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,445
Are you ready to win the next test?

252
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:00,780
Yeah, I hope so.

253
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,211
They're about to start the contest.

254
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,465
What's wrong, Charly?
They're looking for you.

255
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:21,217
- Yes.
- Hurry up.

256
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,928
Yes. I'm sorry, I'll see you in a bit.

257
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,679
- Good luck, handsome.
- [Charly mumbles]

258
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:26,764
No, wait.

259
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,976
- Hey, it's not... Let me explain. I...
- [Antonia laughs]

260
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,062
You don't have to explain anything.

261
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,689
But they are looking for you.

262
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,734
- Yes.
- Yes. Go quick.

263
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:51,330
And well, as we all know,
no macho can be a coward.

264
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,415
That's why today's test will measure

265
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,836
the bravery of each one of
our macho wannabes.

266
00:13:56,919 --> 00:14:02,258
The test will consist of reaching
their damsel in distress and saving her.

267
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:05,302
But, but, but, but, but...

268
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:08,138
this won't be as simple as it sounds,

269
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:13,394
since the parts they need
to finish their ladder to glory

270
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:18,983
are located in this pit
full of manure and mud.

271
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:22,570
The organizers have filled the pit
with their raunchy shit,

272
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:25,281
I mean, from their ranch,
where they have a lot of cows.

273
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,033
- [audience laughs]
- Each team member

274
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:31,620
will look in this disgusting pit

275
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:36,584
for the nails, hammer and the steps
needed to complete the ladder.

276
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:40,963
Then they must reach
their damsel in distress and save her.

277
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,631
- It's a most difficult test.
- [horn blares]

278
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:47,136
THE DAMSEL IN DISTRESS TEST

279
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,680
- Let's go, Charly!
- No fear, my Charly!

280
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:51,557
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

281
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,143
Talk about bad luck. He got picked to be
on the same team as León.

282
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,811
Don't talk to me about Charly right now.

283
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,439
Now... What's wrong?

284
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,774
Did you wake up
on the wrong side of the bed?

285
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,192
Hey, Charly already knows,

286
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,153
but we're going to have
a dinner at the house.

287
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:08,032
Estela is going to make her <i>mole de olla</i>
that's finger-lickin' good.

288
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,200
Of course,
his best friends have to be there.

289
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,286
Don't let me down, eh? See you there.

290
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:13,996
Thanks, Mr. Alonso.

291
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,123
Count me in for everything.
Even what I can take to-go.

292
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,291
There ya go. [laughs]

293
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:20,169
Machos, begin.

294
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,300
No fucking way.

295
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:27,801
[retching]

296
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,597
[retching, coughing]

297
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,561
No way.

298
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,649
What the hell, Santiago? Get in.

299
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,359
I can't stand up. [coughs]

300
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,526
Come on, Santiago.

301
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,779
- Let's go, León! Go, go, go, go!
- Go, León!

302
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:52,117
Charly, Charly, Charly, Charly!

303
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,702
Shut up, you fucking weirdos!

304
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:57,081
Come on, asshole, don't taunt me
because I'll come after you! Come on!

305
00:15:57,164 --> 00:16:00,084
My wife scares me more than you, kid.
Get outta here already.

306
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,794
Go on, go wash some clothes. Come on!

307
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,254
Shut up, you dick! Shut up!

308
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,506
[strains]

309
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,132
He didn't mean it.

310
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,344
- Let's go, León! Let's go!
- Let's go, León!

311
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,471
This is fucking disgusting,
you gotta be shitting me.

312
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,098
- [retches, coughs]
- [grunts]

313
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,849
Hell yeah, I got the hammer.

314
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,434
That's my son!

315
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,061
- Good.
- [Lázaro] Yeah!

316
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,145
Awesome!

317
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:24,441
[audience chanting]
León, León, León, León!

318
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:25,818
Let's go, Charly!

319
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:27,695
Bravo, Charly!

320
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:31,824
Get in here, dude!

321
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,409
You're gonna make us lose, Charlota.

322
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,743
What now?

323
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,705
Ugh, fucking hell!

324
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,832
- Nasty.
- [audience groans]

325
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:42,167
[speaks Spanish]

326
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,044
Disgusting, eh?

327
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,505
I can't even explain the stench.

328
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,799
- [Víctor] Ugh.
- No, well, you can smell it over here.

329
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,509
I remember when I did this test.

330
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:51,719
Ah! [laughs]

331
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,971
- [Joel] How'd you like it?
- [Miriam] That's disgusting.

332
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,265
[Santiago retches, coughs]

333
00:16:58,392 --> 00:16:59,893
Let's go!

334
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,979
Hurry up, hurry up!

335
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,522
Faster, honey!

336
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,232
Go for it!

337
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:09,069
Fucking hell! They're going to beat us
and it's your fault! Get in now!

338
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,821
- I can't. I'm not able to.
- Come on, Santiago!

339
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,448
- Get in, dumbass!
- [Santiago] No, no.

340
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,324
- [Charly] Fucking shit!
- [León] Come on, Santiago.

341
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,243
You can do it, asshole. You can do it.

342
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,123
[León's parent] Quick, little girl!

343
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,791
[Charly] You dumbass!

344
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:27,087
Get in this pit right now,
and take out the box of nails

345
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:30,549
or I'll tell your girlfriend Rosa to
break up with you because you're a coward.

346
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:34,094
Go, do it! Do it, asshole, get in!

347
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,346
- [Santiago retches]
- What are you doing, dude?

348
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,348
- Fucking hell!
- You're shitting me.

349
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,267
Come on, Santiago, get in. Let's go.

350
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,936
They're going to beat you, you dumbasses!

351
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,524
I found the nails.

352
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,653
[audience cheers]

353
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:55,949
Pass me the hammer.

354
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,451
Here you go.

355
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,217
- [León] Come on, Santiago.
- You're doing it wrong, damn it.

356
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,135
- Do it with your wrist, not your forearm.
- No, it's okay.

357
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,845
- Let's see.
- Hey, move over!

358
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,810
Hey, Santiago, help me with this.

359
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:27,481
I taught him that. [laughs]

360
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:30,859
Don't let a woman take the hammer
from you! Grab it, León!

361
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,321
- Quickly, Charlota!
- Shut up, dumbass!

362
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:40,869
[Víctor] And team number 1 is doing well,
as they've finished their ladder

363
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:44,623
and have moved on
to rescuing their damsel.

364
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,837
Hurry up, asshole!
Don't you see they're ahead of you?

365
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,422
- Grab the hammer!
- [León's parent] They're beating you!

366
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,633
[sighs, clicks tongue]

367
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:57,636
- They're about to go up. Move it, move it.
- Shut up.

368
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:58,887
[León] Dude, they're beating us.

369
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,973
[audience cheering]

370
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,643
- [laughs]
- [spectator] No, well, that's great.

371
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,395
Good, guys, good.

372
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,734
[Joel] We have a clear winner, eh?

373
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,028
[Miriam] Of course.

374
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:20,534
[Víctor] Oh, and Mario takes
his damsel into his arms

375
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,578
and begins to come down.

376
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:25,414
[laughs]

377
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:28,167
Ladies and gentlemen of Tunas,

378
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:33,797
we have our first-place team,
and that's team one.

379
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,842
Remember that
each of the contestants earned

380
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:40,804
ten cumulative points for tomorrow's test.

381
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:45,642
Help, help. Someone rescue me.

382
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,811
Hey, dude, leave this to the badasses.

383
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:49,479
Go, dude.

384
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:52,316
[contestant] Help them, Pepe.

385
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,484
- Dude, hurry up already!
- [León] Shut up, Charlota.

386
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:59,865
[crowd chanting] León, León, León, León!

387
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,534
[Charly] Now, now, now. Go up.

388
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,288
Come on, León.

389
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,873
- Get up there, dude!
- Let's go, damn it.

390
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,333
Shut up, you fucking broad!

391
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,296
[clasp clinks]

392
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,548
- Hurry up!
- Shut up!

393
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:27,059
[audience chanting] León, León,
León, León, León, León, León, León!

394
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:32,898
Thank you, my macho.

395
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:39,071
[Víctor] And the second team to qualify
for the next round is team two!

396
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:40,781
Let's have a round of applause for them!

397
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:42,866
[Miriam] Let's hear it!

398
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,702
Fuck.

399
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,120
Again.

400
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:51,083
Santiago, León and Charly

401
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,670
have each earned
six points for the next test.

402
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,630
- Second place is good, right?
- Second place is perfect.

403
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:59,841
- Okay.
- Please help me. Run, run.

404
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:07,474
[damsel screams]

405
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:08,725
Ah!

406
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:11,228
A "padamedic", a "padamedic"...
a paramedic.

407
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:12,813
Is there a doctor in the house?

408
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:16,650
- [Miriam] She got up.
- [Joel] She got up.

409
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,318
[Víctor] Take her to the holding area!

410
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:22,990
And team three was able to stand up.

411
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:26,660
They saved their damsel.
She may be a bit beaten up and shaken up,

412
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,912
- but we can forgive that, can't we?
- No, no, no.

413
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,456
- I think the rope was quite messed up.
- No, no, no.

414
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,625
You decide, miss.

415
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:37,629
Tell us, should team three
stay in the contest?

416
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:42,718
- Yes.
- [Víctor] Team 3 has two cumulative points

417
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,178
- for tomorrow's test.
- Yes!

418
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,014
[Víctor laughs]

419
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:52,936
And all nine macho wannabes
remain in the contest!

420
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,521
[audience cheers]

421
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:56,481
It was one thing after the next, eh?

422
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,074
Sir, you have to go down
with the townspeople.

423
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:07,951
Let's go.

424
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,914
TEST: DAMSEL IN DISTRESS
EDITION: CXVI

425
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,624
- Congratulations, Charly.
- Congratulations.

426
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,711
Oh, Son, you went above and beyond, eh?

427
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:20,797
Seriously. No, no, no, no, no.
Six points, that's not bad.

428
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,049
But ten is better.

429
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:25,052
No, yeah, but you'll have more tests
to gain the points back, don't worry.

430
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:28,889
I gotta go because I'm going to help
your mom make that dish you love,

431
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:30,349
the <i>molito de olla</i>.

432
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:31,850
Sounds delicious.

433
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,853
Okay. See you soon, Son.

434
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:35,937
Okay.

435
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,067
[Juanito] Charly.

436
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:42,903
Charly.

437
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:46,239
Congrats.

438
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,949
- [Jerónimo] Come here, guys.
- Thanks.

439
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,202
- [Juanito] Mr. Mayor, please.
- [Jerónimo] Yes, of course.

440
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:52,287
Guys, please come with me.

441
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,164
- What's up, Charly?
- [Charly] Hi, how are you?

442
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,584
Congratulations, Charly.

443
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,252
Thank you, thank you.

444
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,838
Come have dinner at our house tonight, eh?

445
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,382
But take a shower first, eh?

446
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:04,716
[Jerónimo laughs]

447
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,927
- I'm joking.
- [laughs]

448
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,970
- [Charly] I'd love to be there.
- No fucking way.

449
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:12,057
- Showered and all. Thanks, Jerónimo.
- I'm joking, I'm joking.

450
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,683
- [chuckles]
- [Juanito] Great. Great.

451
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,727
- Okay.
- Can you take a picture for us, Charly?

452
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,437
- Please. Quickly, yeah?
- My pleasure.

453
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,356
- A picture, let's go, let's go, let's go.
- Yes.

454
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:21,441
- Here in the middle.
- Of course.

455
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:26,029
No, Charly. Don't put your arm
around them. Just pose like that.

456
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,114
That's it.

457
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,699
- Great. One more?
- Thanks. Yes.

458
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,535
- [Juanito] Thank you, guys.
- Thanks. [chuckles]

459
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,578
- [Juanito] Congrats.
- See you at the house. Bye.

460
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,789
You're shitting me, he smells like shit.

461
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:42,712
All right, well, we also can have dinner
at the mayor's house.

462
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,673
- We're a team, right?
- [Charly scoffs]

463
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,925
I don't think the mayor wants
any chickens at his house.

464
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:48,301
Tone it down, dude.

465
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,846
We rescued the damsel and we didn't get
last place. So, that's enough.

466
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,973
We were this close to losing
because of you, Santiago.

467
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,433
We passed the test, didn't we?

468
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,268
You think you're badass
because the mayor supports you,

469
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,728
- but you're not worth shit.
- You're the one who's not worth shit.

470
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:01,982
Although you always want to screw me over,
in the end, other people fucked up.

471
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:03,817
That proves you're an idiot.

472
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,236
- I'm so sick of you, you fucking...
- Enough. Leave it for now.

473
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,320
Get out of here.

474
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:09,698
Calm down, dude.

475
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:10,782
Fucking butch.

476
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:15,412
- [shower running]
- [contestants chattering]

477
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:17,873
[chuckles]

478
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,750
THE PICKUP LINE

479
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:24,588
You weren't disgusted
to get in that thing?

480
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,465
[chuckles]
You're not disgusted kissing me?

481
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:27,716
Don't I smell horrible?

482
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:31,052
I don't know, but whatever it is
turns me on, damn it.

483
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:39,394
Ah, enough. I gotta go.
Before they start looking for me.

484
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,605
Mm-mmm. No. Don't go.

485
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,998
I almost kicked León's ass.

486
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:03,835
That dude's jealous because
Jerónimo invited me to dinner and not him.

487
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:08,006
What? Wasn't your dad planning
a dinner for you tonight?

488
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:12,344
Well, yeah, but the mayor
doesn't invite you over every day.

489
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,763
My dad will have to understand.

490
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:17,474
Charly, hey,
can you give us your autograph?

491
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:19,893
- Of course. What's your name?
- My name is Ana.

492
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:27,651
- It's nice to meet you, Ana.
- [chuckles] You too, thanks.

493
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,990
Did you see that? They're crazy for me.

494
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,368
Who cares?

495
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:41,498
Charly, you didn't sign up
for the contest for this. Right?

496
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:45,293
I thought we were going to show everyone
how stupid these tests are.

497
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,547
Well, yeah, but you don't understand
how much it means to me

498
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,257
to become the next King of the Machos.

499
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:54,344
It's something powerful that...
that I can't put into words.
