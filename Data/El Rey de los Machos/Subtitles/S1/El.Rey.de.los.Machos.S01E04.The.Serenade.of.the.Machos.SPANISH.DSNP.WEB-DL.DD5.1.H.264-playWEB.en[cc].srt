I told you this would lead to trouble.

00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:17,308
This makes the hostel look really bad.

3
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:20,520
You see that, right?

4
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,236
Nothing happened here.

I'm sorry, but I need to be alone.

00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,941
{\an8}I think it's best
if I drop out of the contest.

10
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,696
{\an8}It was a terrible idea to begin with,
don't you think?

{\an8}[horse blusters]

12

- What's up, Son? Where were you?

- What's wrong?

{\an8}Uh, I need you to tell Mom
that I'm dropping out of the contest.

16
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:30,340
{\an8}I think she'll be
much more relaxed that way.

17
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,092
{\an8}Your mom will have to understand.

18

{\an8}You're not giving up on your dreams.

they won't go away until you achieve them.

{\an8}You're doing great.

21
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:42,852
{\an8}You took the first step,
which is the hardest.

22
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,312
{\an8}What did you think? It'd be easy?

23
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:45,730
{\an8}- Of course not, but...
- Tell...

24
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,233
{\an8}- Don't be a complainer like your dad.
- [chuckles]

25
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,777
{\an8}Better yet, close your eyes.
I have a surprise for you.

26

{\an8}Hold this. But close your eyes.

27
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,489
{\an8}- You know I don't like surprises.

You earned it.

35
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,144
I just want to make one thing clear:

36
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:26,479
I love you

37
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,483

I'll always be here for you.

41
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:48,084
[in Spanish] My dear residents of Tunas,
welcome to an episode of <i>First Lady Tips</i>.

42
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,213
Today, I'd like you to meet Consuelo,

43
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:55,049
who's my right-hand woman at home.

44
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:58,970
I mean, besides my husband who,
even though he has lots of things to do,

45
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:01,181
does do a thing or two.

46
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,473
Right, Consuelo?

47
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:07,395
Why don't we open our minds
to learning new languages

48
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:10,690
and new ways of communicating
with the help?

49
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:14,694
Consuelo is from Oaxaca,
and she speaks Oaxacan,

50
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:17,238
and she's taught me some new words.

51
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:22,285
Like, in Oaxacan, "to clean" is "<i>rusiá</i>"

52
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,621
and "to shake," "<i>riguibi.</i>"

53
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:25,705
Watch this.

54
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:28,082
Consuelo, <i>rusiá</i> there.

55
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,167
Yes, ma'am.

56
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:34,130
[yells, laughs] Did you see that?

57
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,675
Well, my dear residents of Tunas,
I hope you've loved this,

58
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,554
and I'll see you on the next episode
of <i>First Lady Tips</i>.

59
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,974
- [Jerónimo] Perfect, eh?
- [chuckles]

60
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,353
Oh, hurry up. Okay, okay, okay, okay.

61
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:49,729
Baby, wow, eh?

62
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:53,650
- You liked it?
- Hey, but doesn't Consu speak Zapotec?

63
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:57,070
Oh, babe, people don't understand that.

64
00:03:57,153 --> 00:04:00,698
I mean, Consuelo is from Oaxaca,
so she speaks Oaxacan.

65
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,492
- Uh-huh.
- It's like how if you're from England,

66
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,576
you speak English.

67
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,495
If you're from Spain, you speak Spanish.

68
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,413
Obviously, obviously, obviously.

69
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:11,292
Hey, you know what?
We're really running late for the contest.

70
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,460
- No, babe, no.
- Mm-hmm.

71
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,003
I just don't... Don't make me go.

72
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,213
Baby, we need to go now.

73
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,090
- Remember that it's the only...
- No, babe.

74
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:20,677
...it's the only thing you have to do
as the first lady of this shithole town.

"You're not Google, but you've got
everything I'm searching for."

76
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,891
- Hey!
- Nah, that won't work on the townspeople.

77
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:27,976
No, this one:

78
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,646
"I wish I were a cat so I could spend
seven lifetimes by your side."

79
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:33,564
[Charly chuckles]

80
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:39,612
Or this one: "I'd like to be a pillow
so you could hug me every morning."

81
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,782
- Dude, that one doesn't even make sense.
- [Marquito] Aw, how nice.

82
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:45,118
This one:

83
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:49,080
"When you get fined for being
too beautiful, I'll pay your bail."

84
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:51,874
- Ah! That's good.
- [Charly] No.

85
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,836
[Ajolote] No mercy with the pickup lines.
Bring out all the heavy artillery.

86
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,672
Don't be shy. Go in hard,
and straight for the target.

87
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:00,842
In this case, go in hard... [kisses]
...and for you know where, bro. [chuckles]

88
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,428
- You'll do well, okay? You got this.
- [chuckles] Damn straight.

Okay, enough, yeah?
Why are you looking at me like that?

92
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,741
I'm sorry, Charly,
I've never told you this,

93
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,328
but you hide your boobs really well.

94
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:36,753

00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:20,844
Now he wants to commit
an indecent, obscene, immoral act.

331
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,555
People, we're gonna support Charly.

332
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:27,059
Charly is a unique contestant,
and he can make history.

333
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:29,436
So now it turns out
that you're afraid of a pair of tits?

334

- [crowd gasping]
- [Miriam] You're not helping yourself.

335

This isn't a joke, folks.

336
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,151
- Our town's reputation depends on us.
- Time to act, Mr. Mayor.

340
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,204
Dear residents of Tunas...

341
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:53,377
because this is a polarizing matter,

342
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:57,464
I didn't want to interfere.

343
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:03,595
But there comes a time
when a man must fight for freedom.

344
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,514
Therefore,

345
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:10,227
I support Charly's reinstatement
in the contest.

Let me remind you that you're mayor
because I supported you.

Well, I already paid you back
and then some, right, Lázaro?

Given these developments,

the honorable King of the Machos

353
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,963
to repeal the previous decision.

354
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,967
Charly Tejeda will continue
in the competition.

- No, no. No!
- No way.

356

No way can we let ourselves
fall to sin like this!

you're back in the competition.
