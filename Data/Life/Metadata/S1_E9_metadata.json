Their struggle for life, like animals (only usually much slower), is about food (including parasitism and 'flesh-eating'). They strive to find water, to procreate: notably pollination-mostly by animals and semination - gliding or by weather conditions, or more primitive ways such as spores. They have a varied defense (thorns, spines, toxins etc.). Specific is the need for light, the fuel of photosynthesis, leading to a hierarchy of light-related levels, because not growing high enough in time can be lethal.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "1561896", "rating": 8.7, "votes": 575, "number_of_episodes": 11}
