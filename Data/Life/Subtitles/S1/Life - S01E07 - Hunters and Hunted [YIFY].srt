1
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,700
Life is at its most intense

2
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,100
during the struggles
between predator and prey.

3
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,000
Each side, to survive,

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,900
must outwit
and outmanoeuvre the other.

5
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,900
The prize, for the hunter...

6
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,300
a meal.

7
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:59,600
For the prey,
the chance to live another day.

8
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,500
Three male cheetahs.

9
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,500
These brothers are very special.

10
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,300
They hunt prey few other cheetahs
would dare to tackle.

11
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,400
To succeed,
they must first select a victim.

12
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:54,600
And then work together
to overpower it.

13
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,900
It's dangerous work.

14
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,300
An adult zebra is
potentially lethal.

15
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,300
The outcome is by no means certain.

16
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,800
The first cheetah is driven off.

17
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,700
And his brothers have already
made a critical mistake.

18
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,000
They aren't close enough
to take over the attack.

19
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,300
Each is chasing a different target,

20
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,500
making it easy for
the zebra to defend their young.

21
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,400
A quarter-tonne stallion
finally puts paid to their chances.

22
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:34,200
Chasing different zebra
was bound to lead to failure.

23
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,700
Perhaps their enthusiasm
got the better of them.

24
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,100
They must try again.

25
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,600
In the shadow of Mount Kenya,
the brothers regroup.

26
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:06,100
Their mistake with the zebra was
to hunt as ordinary cheetahs do -

27
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,400
as individuals.

28
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,000
To catch such prey, they must
hunt like no other cheetahs.

29
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,300
That means acting together,

30
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,800
as one.

31
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,500
They start again.

32
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,700
An ostrich outweighs and outguns
a single cheetah.

33
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,000
This time there's only one target.

34
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,900
And all three cheetahs are onto it.

35
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,100
The third brother starts to
throttle the ostrich.

36
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,000
Even off its feet,
it's still dangerous.

37
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,300
The brothers have found a unique way
of catching their prey.

38
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,400
The ability to invent such
novel hunting tactics

39
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,600
is one thing
that really sets mammals apart.

40
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,500
But mammals themselves can also
be targets for predators,

41
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:10,200
and the hunted
also need to devise special tactics.

42
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,900
The desert shores of the Dead Sea.

43
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,300
Living here is difficult indeed.

44
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:47,100
It's March, and high
on these cathedral cliffs,

45
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,800
ibex have given birth.

46
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,700
For the first few days
the kids were kept safe,

47
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,000
isolated on the cliff tops.

48
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,200
But now the ibex have a problem.

49
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,600
The only food and water is far
below at the bottom of the gorge.

50
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,900
And that is where predators lurk.

51
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,600
If they're to feed,
it's a risk they will have to take.

52
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,600
The adults lead the way.

53
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,400
They know the safest routes.

54
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,500
Though safe, here,
is a relative term.

55
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,500
The kids
have no choice but to keep up.

56
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,500
One slip could be the last.

57
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:37,200
Their only assets are cloven hooves
that spread under load,

58
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,100
astonishing balance...

59
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,200
..and the most uncanny agility.

60
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,300
Barely a week old,
they are utterly fearless.

61
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:57,600
Learning to negotiate these cliffs
is central to their survival.

62
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:18,400
But now the family must be
on guard against predators.

63
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,400
All grab a chance to browse.

64
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,600
Trailing behind,
the last youngster is almost down.

65
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,900
And runs right into trouble.

66
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,700
A fox.

67
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,100
It's been waiting for the straggler.

68
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,700
The kid has never seen a fox before,
but knows it's in real peril.

69
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,600
It appears to be running
into more trouble,

70
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,700
as it heads back up the cliff.

71
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,900
The fox tries to
gain the higher ground.

72
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,700
But the kid has found safety

73
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:07,400
on a face so steep
that only an ibex could stand there.

74
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,900
The lessons learnt
on this morning's descent

75
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,600
have saved its life.

76
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,400
Finally, the fox
gives it up as a bad job...

77
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,700
..perhaps suddenly aware
it's standing on a precipice.

78
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,400
Despite its tender age,

79
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:47,300
the ibex has outwitted
one of the canniest of predators.

80
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:59,300
The fox's failure
epitomises a predator's plight.

81
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,800
Most hunts fail,

82
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,800
so hunters are continually
devising new tactics.

83
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,900
The rainforests of Belize
in Central America.

84
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,600
And as evening falls
and the shower comes to an end,

85
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,100
a predator begins to hunt.

86
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,100
The greater bulldog bat.

87
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,300
A flying mammal...

88
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,300
..and a fisherman.

89
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:31,100
A fish swimming just below the
surface creates tell-tale ripples

90
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:35,100
and that is all the bat needs
to detect them.

91
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,100
With little more than a fin
to aim for,

92
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,600
and whilst flying at
40 miles an hour,

93
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,900
the bat takes the fish
completely unawares.

94
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,100
If the shoal scatters...

95
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,300
..the bat trawls the surface.

96
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,500
Raking the water,
trying to snag a fish.

97
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:24,300
He won't have the best
fishing spot to himself for long,

98
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,300
and soon, other bats arrive.

99
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:39,200
Oncoming traffic would make
grabbing a fish almost impossible,

100
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,600
so the bats avoid collisions
by honking -

101
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,900
dropping their calls an octave
to say, "Look out, here I come!"

102
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,700
Soon the shoal has either
been captured or has fled,

103
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,900
and the bats move on.

104
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,000
Skills like this take practice,

105
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,500
and for some mammals that
practice begins in infancy.

106
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,100
A young stoat.

107
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,200
And it's not alone.

108
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,800
STOATS CHIRP

109
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,200
These wild games
are too much to resist.

110
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,300
Stalking, chasing and ambushing,
all practised in play.

111
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:58,300
Soon the young stoats must
hunt for themselves,

112
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:02,800
and then these athletic skills
will be crucial.

113
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,500
It's September
in the English countryside.

114
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:30,500
This stoat is about to take on
an adversary ten times its size.

115
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,700
It's too dangerous
to rush straight in.

116
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,500
Instead, the stoat's aim
is to wear the rabbit down.

117
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,200
The rabbit is flagging,

118
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,700
and the stoat's stamina is
starting to make a difference.

119
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,200
But stamina alone is not enough -

120
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,400
the rabbit must still
be overpowered.

121
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,600
A bite to the back of the neck

122
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,500
and a kill.

123
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:09,300
The incredible agility of the stoat,
practised since it was a kit,

124
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,200
was just enough
to swing the balance.

125
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,100
There are times when
mere physical powers

126
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,200
are not enough to give
the hunter an edge.

127
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:32,800
Then mammals must deploy their most
sophisticated weapon - their brains.

128
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:37,400
Strange patterns are visible
in the mud of Florida Bay,

129
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,700
a faint hint
of a unique hunting tactic.

130
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,000
The perpetrators...

131
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,500
..bottlenose dolphins.

132
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:58,900
And they're on a mission -
a mission to catch fish.

133
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,800
The fish here
are very difficult to catch

134
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,200
and in such shallow water
they ought to be safe.

135
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,300
Yet the dolphins have a plan.

136
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,200
They have learnt to corral the fish

137
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,700
by working as a team.

138
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:40,100
The lead dolphin beats its tail
on the sea bed,

139
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,300
stirring up a ring of mud.

140
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,500
Trapped inside, the fish
take their only way out,

141
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:52,200
but they're leaping out of
the frying pan and into the fire.

142
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,500
Once the mud ring loses its shape,
the fish scatter.

143
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,800
The dolphins move on
and repeat the process.

144
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,100
Brain power
combined with team work -

145
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,700
it's a winning formula.

146
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:54,800
This behaviour is unique to
the dolphins of Florida Bay.

147
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,600
Successive generations have
learnt it from their parents

148
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,000
and in turn they will teach it
to their own young.

149
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
The ability to pass on
such complex behaviours

150
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,500
is one of the mammals'
greatest talents.

151
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,700
It enables them to survive
where others would perish.

152
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:58,000
As winter approaches in Alaska, food
gets progressively harder to find.

153
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,300
To live here is to walk a tightrope.

154
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,800
Yet every year, this coast attracts

155
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,100
North America's
most impressive hunter.

156
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,400
A brown bear.

157
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:41,700
Here they grow larger
than anywhere in the world.

158
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:49,100
Other bears have also gathered
at the edge of the surf.

159
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,500
They've come here
to fatten up for the winter.

160
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,500
They're waiting for an event
that happens just once a year.

161
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,100
The salmon run.

162
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:17,100
Others will tackle the fish
upriver, but here in the sea,

163
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,900
these bears have the first chance.

164
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:53,400
Each bear's survival depends
on this run of fish staying strong.

165
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:11,900
There are years when their gamble
fails and the fish hardly show.

166
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,600
Then the bears face starvation.

167
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,600
This year promises to
be a bumper one

168
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,700
and the bears will be able to
pile on the pounds ahead of winter.

169
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,200
Mammals are supreme
in their ability

170
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,600
to exploit
such fleeting opportunities.

171
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,900
Chances come and go
with the passing of the seasons.

172
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:08,000
But for some predators, conditions
are tough whatever the time of year.

173
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:22,000
At first glance, these mountains
seem barren and empty of life.

174
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,600
Like islands thrust up into the sky,

175
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,700
they tower above
the surrounding plains.

176
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,100
Yet, far from being deserted,
they are a refuge.

177
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,600
Isolated here,
on the roof of Africa,

178
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,300
is one of the rarest hunters
in the world.

179
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,900
The Ethiopian wolf.

180
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:00,800
The only wolf in
the whole of Africa.

181
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:20,900
Despite being close to the equator,
these peaks are so cold at night

182
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:24,900
that the wolves face
a frost-covered dawn.

183
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:33,700
Each pack is centred around
a single dominant female.

184
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,600
Normally it is only she who breeds.

185
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,300
This year she has produced six pups.

186
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,400
But if she is to raise them all
in this barren land,

187
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,800
she will need the help
of the entire pack.

188
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:01,700
Every morning,
the pack sets off to hunt,

189
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:06,400
leaving her back among the rocks
with the pups.

190
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,300
The pack's hunting ground is about
five square miles of mountain top.

191
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,700
They guard it zealously,

192
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,500
patrolling its frontiers every day.

193
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,400
Wolves elsewhere co-operate

194
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,100
and use their united power
to pull down big prey.

195
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,900
But there are no caribou or moose
to be found up here.

196
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,400
The pack splits up.

197
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,500
Each member is going to hunt alone.

198
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,900
One of them spots something.

199
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,100
It's a rat.

200
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:19,500
But catching rats is not easy, no
matter how carefully you stalk them.

201
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:27,000
Another hunter has
a more pro-active technique.

202
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,300
And that works.

203
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:42,400
It's a lot of work for
relatively small rewards,

204
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,100
and demands its own

205
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,900
particular style of hunting.

206
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,800
A hunter returns.

207
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:14,500
Mother demands food and
the successful hunter delivers it.

208
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,700
So rearing a single litter here

209
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:29,000
takes the combined labour
of a dozen or so adults

210
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,700
and the Ethiopian wolves
have adjusted their behaviour
accordingly.

211
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,500
That adaptability is
the mammals' great strength,

212
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:48,500
enabling them to survive in
some very unlikely habitats.

213
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,800
A star-nosed mole,

214
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:02,100
possessor of perhaps the most
extraordinary nose on the planet.

215
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:15,500
Its nostrils are surrounded
by twenty-two fingers.

216
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:25,700
Fingers that allow the mole to sense
the world around it by touch alone.

217
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:32,100
It enables it to detect food
with astonishing speed.

218
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,900
It can also swim...

219
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:04,000
..and once underwater, its nose
helps it in a most extraordinary way.

220
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:25,200
It blows out a bubble
and breathes it back in,

221
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,700
detecting in a millisecond
if there's prey close by.

222
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:42,700
This bubble-blowing allows it to
sniff out its food underwater,

223
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:47,600
but, unfortunately, that means
it soon runs out of breath.

224
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,100
So it's just as well

225
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:52,900
that it can hunt as fast down here
as on the surface.

226
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,000
Few creatures can hunt

227
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
equally successfully
underground and underwater.

228
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,900
Bandhavgarh, India,

229
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,400
at the height of the dry season.

230
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,200
A chital deer.

231
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,200
They must live their lives with
all their senses at a high pitch.

232
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,300
The faintest smell,

233
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,900
the slightest sound,

234
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,700
the briefest glimpse

235
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,500
could give warning of an attack.

236
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:23,400
The chital must detect their enemy

237
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,900
before it takes them by surprise.

238
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,900
And they have allies.

239
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,200
Langur monkeys.

240
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,500
Keen eyesight
and a perch high in the trees

241
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:47,100
means they can scan the forest.

242
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,800
The jungle is full of distraction.

243
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:04,300
Senses are strained,
trying to detect approaching danger.

244
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,100
Yet the chital still need to feed.

245
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,500
And the hunter must get
within striking distance.

246
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,800
There's a hint of danger
carried on the wind.

247
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,200
The herd shares a nervousness.

248
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:44,700
You should never run from
what you can't see,

249
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,000
you might just run
straight into danger.

250
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:57,700
The tiger is nearly close enough
to launch her attack.

251
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,300
She must wait.

252
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:05,900
The chital need to come
just a little closer.

253
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,300
If she moves now,
the langurs will see her.

254
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:02,700
The deer had a moment's head start,
and escape.

255
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:09,800
The langurs' vigilance
saved the chital.

256
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,700
And the tiger goes hungry.

257
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:25,600
For some mammals,
attack is the best form of defence.

258
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,500
This squirrel is arming herself.

259
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,200
It's a California ground squirrel,

260
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,900
and she's found a snake skin.

261
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,900
She's chewing it into a paste

262
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:54,400
which she then rubs into her fur,
especially her tail.

263
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,300
She now stinks of snake.

264
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:06,900
She lives in a colony that extends
across a wide expanse of prairie.

265
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:10,200
There is one downside
to this neighbourhood -

266
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,800
it's in the middle of
rattlesnake country.

267
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:18,200
Not good when you have
young to raise.

268
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,800
Her neighbour has sensed something.

269
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:29,200
A rattlesnake,
hidden right next to their burrow.

270
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,500
They both investigate
but what can they do?

271
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,900
Kicking stones only
provokes the snake.

272
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,300
Rattlesnakes sense prey
by the heat they give off

273
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:55,300
and the squirrel is able
to take advantage of this.

274
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,400
She heats up her
tail with warm blood.

275
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:12,300
Waving it at the snake is a threat.

276
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,800
It makes her look much larger
than she is.

277
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,300
SNAKE RATTLES

278
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:35,100
And the scent of rattler on her
fluffed tail intimidates the snake.

279
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,200
It decides to retreat.

280
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:53,100
The mother decides this part of
the neighbourhood is too dangerous,

281
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:57,000
and moves her young
to new quarters.

282
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,400
With luck, this may be
a safer place to raise a family.

283
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:23,200
Both predator and prey must
endlessly refine their strategies.

284
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:30,100
Just occasionally, an individual
makes a unique breakthrough

285
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:33,300
and learns to do something
completely new.

286
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:42,000
It's December, and a storm rages
around the Falkland Islands.

287
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:47,800
Gentoo penguins face blizzards
of blown sand.

288
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,300
Young elephant seals

289
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:12,200
risk being dragged off the rocks
by the surging waves

290
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,100
and swept out into open water.

291
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:46,800
Orca - the largest and most
predatory of the dolphin family.

292
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,100
Killer whales.

293
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:04,200
This pod of nine can only
survive here by being opportunists.

294
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:13,900
Normally, young elephant seals
are not on the menu.

295
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,900
They stay close to the shore,

296
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:19,800
safe in the shallows of
their nursery pool.

297
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,900
The pool is almost entirely
cut off from the sea.

298
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:33,100
A narrow, shallow channel is
the only access to the open water.

299
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:42,000
But this pod of killer whales

300
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,500
contains a very special female.

301
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:50,100
She's easily identified by her calf,
which is always close by.

302
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,200
Every year she comes to the pool
at the same time,

303
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,500
when the seals
first swim in the shallows.

304
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:05,300
She knows how to get them.

305
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:16,000
Negotiating the channel
is her first challenge.

306
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:22,500
The water near the mouth of the pool
is slightly deeper.

307
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,800
Here she sets her ambush,

308
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,200
waiting for a seal
to stray out of the shallows.

309
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:39,100
For mother and calf,
this is an extremely risky ploy.

310
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:44,800
She must continuously assess how big
the waves are, how deep the water is

311
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,000
and what the tide is doing.

312
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:52,000
One bad decision would see
both mother and calf stranded.

313
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,700
The seals lie in the shallows,

314
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:02,800
just out of reach
and unaware of her presence.

315
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,400
But she is more than aware
of the dropping tide.

316
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:20,300
A floundering seal
catches her attention...

317
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:27,500
..and with her calf,
she slowly moves towards it.

318
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:34,000
The seal is lying
right on the edge of a rocky ledge,

319
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,900
oblivious to the danger.

320
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:51,700
The projecting ledge
keeps the seal just out of reach.

321
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,700
Yet she has a plan.

322
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,000
Rocking back and forth,
she's making a wave,

323
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,200
trying to wash the seal
off the ledge.

324
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:19,600
But it is securely
surrounded by kelp.

325
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:24,100
SPLASHING

326
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,900
A splash alerts her
to a better opportunity.

327
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:33,900
Another seal has started to swim
into the pool. This is her chance.

328
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,300
Edging further into the shallows
than ever before,

329
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:48,300
she's risking everything.

330
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,900
Half beached and with
a struggling seal in her mouth,

331
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:06,200
it takes all her strength
to drag it out of the pool.

332
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,300
She is the only killer whale
on the planet

333
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:50,100
that knows how to hunt
these seals in this way

334
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:55,200
and, crucially, she's now passing
on that skill to her own calf.

335
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:10,200
Extraordinary strategies like these

336
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:15,000
lie at the heart of the struggle
between predator and prey.

337
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:20,100
They're born of a conflict
that is relentless and unforgiving.

338
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:26,500
A conflict that eternally binds
the hunter and the hunted.

339
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,900
It's looking very promising.

340
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:45,300
The Life team had set themselves
a tough challenge

341
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:48,500
in trying to film
exceptional hunting sequences,

342
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,500
but our teams were lucky enough

343
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:54,400
to observe some of the world's
most charismatic predators.

344
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:02,900
It was the killer whales
of the Falklands, though,

345
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:05,800
that brought the team
closest to the action.

346
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:11,100
Every year, off Sea Lion Island,

347
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:15,400
killer whales snatch young elephant
seals from their nursery pool.

348
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:23,400
Filming most hunting sequences
involves a great deal of waiting

349
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:28,100
and a slice of luck, but here
things were a little different.

350
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:33,100
Cameraman Mike Pitts and
producer Adam Chapman travelled
to the Falklands

351
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:39,700
having heard that, for two weeks
each year, killer whales focus
on one particular spot.

352
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:48,300
The killer whales have learnt
to target elephant seal pups

353
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,800
as they first venture into the water

354
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,100
and this gives the team
their best chance of filming a hunt.

355
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:07,700
The first task facing the team
is to familiarise themselves

356
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:09,800
not only with a new location

357
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:14,400
but also with the animals
they will be working around.

358
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:24,100
And the team soon realise
that they and their equipment

359
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:26,900
are a great novelty
to the seal pups.

360
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,200
I daren't look into the camera

361
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,300
because I'm more worried about
the tripod being knocked over.

362
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,000
We've got a little friend here

363
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,800
so I'm gonna report him for
interfering with the film crew.

364
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:42,600
The pups' fascination with the team
is rather unexpected.

365
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,700
You've got a great way
with wildlife, Michael!

366
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:51,500
At one with nature!

367
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:55,800
It's quite difficult out here.
There's so many of them.

368
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:59,900
The large number of youngsters
bodes well for the killer whales,

369
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:02,400
but the longer
the team spend with the pups,

370
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,900
the more they warm to them.

371
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,800
When you look at these little pups

372
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,000
you can't fail
to be captivated by them,

373
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,300
especially when you gaze
into those eyes,

374
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,800
it really pulls on
your heartstrings,

375
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:18,200
but for an orca, of course,
it's 120 kilos of pure protein,

376
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:22,000
so that's why they're hunted.

377
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:35,300
As the days go by, the team continue
to get a feel for the location,

378
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:38,200
when suddenly
the killer whales arrive.

379
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:49,300
The pod of nine is clearly
interested in the pool,

380
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:52,000
and one female is
particularly confident.

381
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,700
She's coming in.

382
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:19,900
The female and her calf start
to come into the pool regularly,

383
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:22,500
but there never seems to be
a pup within reach.

384
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,600
The team have come to the Falklands
prepared to film underwater.

385
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:36,400
Now the time has come to see
if this is a realistic ambition.

386
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:46,600
With lookouts posted and the whales
far away, Mike is able to get in.

387
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,800
Even so,

388
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:56,200
who can blame him for being jumpy?

389
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,200
Ah!

390
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:03,400
Whoo!

391
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:08,300
The pups' playfulness is becoming an
issue - the last thing the team want

392
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:11,500
is to have any influence
on the events they're here to film.

393
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:23,700
There's also the question of
how the killer whales might react

394
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,500
to a person in the water.

395
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,900
It's quite intimidating in there.

396
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:35,300
It shelves up, so I'm in the centre
of the channel and it goes down to,

397
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:38,500
I don't know, maybe eight feet
I think, a couple of metres.

398
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,700
But the visibility's
really stirred up.

399
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:44,200
How they find their way in
that channel I just don't know.

400
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:47,800
And what I'm worried about
is if I do get in the water
with the orca...

401
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:52,300
Which I'm slightly concerned about,
I have to say...

402
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:56,100
She's in a hunting mode,
she's not here just for her

403
00:53:56,100 --> 00:54:00,600
to pass the time of day.
She's out there to kill something,

404
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:04,500
and, you know, I just don't want
to be that person, or seal...

405
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:05,900
Whatever she thinks I am.

406
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:10,300
She'll probably realise once she's
bitten me that she's made a mistake

407
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:14,300
and, I don't know,
is it worth the gamble? No. No.

408
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:16,200
With a week already gone,

409
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:20,500
the killer whales have not
yet made a full-blown attack,

410
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:24,100
and then the weather changes.

411
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:27,100
Well, hopefully it'll blow
itself out but I think...

412
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:32,000
The pool, it's going to be a couple
of days before that calms down.

413
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,600
The storm rages for two more days,

414
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:38,500
but on the eleventh day
the good weather returns.

415
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:44,000
Mike knows that time is running out.

416
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,700
Well, the orcas are out there,
they're still quite a way off.

417
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:50,500
The team decides a camera
on the end of a pole

418
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:53,800
might be the way to reveal
the underwater action.

419
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,500
After that storm,
it's been so stirred up.

420
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:02,700
And just... Just bring it slightly
out of the water, Adam,

421
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:05,300
so draw it back towards you and stop.

422
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:13,000
And it's dark, dark, green,
basically, very dark green.

423
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,500
There's still a lot of...

424
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:16,800
Suspension, yeah.

425
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,800
The storm had stirred up the pool

426
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:24,500
making it hard to see anything,
but the team remain in good spirits.

427
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:26,900
Does my bum look big in this?

428
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:29,600
Massive!

429
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,500
As the seal pups are nearly
ready to go to sea,

430
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:36,400
the whales' opportunity
to hunt this year will soon pass

431
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:40,100
and the team know
this could be their last chance.

432
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,300
Look at the size of that fin!

433
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:49,300
OK, Mike, she's coming in.

434
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:51,900
She's coming in, Mike.
She's coming in?

435
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:54,500
Just here.

436
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,100
Mike?

437
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,900
One second, mate.

438
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:05,400
I can talk to you gently here now

439
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:09,100
and I can also see
where you're pointing.

440
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:10,500
She's in.

441
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,200
I'm recording.
Hold it steady, hold it steady.

442
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,700
I got it.

443
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,600
She's gone past, Mike,
she's in the pool.

444
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,100
OK, get in there.

445
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:51,400
She's got one, definitely,
you can't mistake it.

446
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,900
Bringing it out now.
Taking it straight out.

447
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,500
She's pulling it out.

448
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:11,600
Out to sea...

449
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,100
Taking it under.

450
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,500
God, he just got hammered.

451
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:26,200
Part of me's elated that I've got it,
but part of me's sad, really,

452
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:30,800
cos I've watched these
little characters, these pups
grow in the last few weeks

453
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:33,100
and the orcas too,
they've got to survive

454
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:35,700
and they've made a successful hunt

455
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:41,100
and they're now continuing
their journey, so what can you say?

456
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:47,000
Witnessing such events often results
in such a conflict of emotions.

457
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,100
The two-week window is over
and the killer whales move on.

458
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:54,800
It'll be a whole year before
this exceptional female

459
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,800
returns here to hunt again.
