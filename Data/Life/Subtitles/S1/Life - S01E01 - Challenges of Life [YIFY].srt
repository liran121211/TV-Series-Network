1
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,300
Our planet may be home

2
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,200
to 30 million different
kinds of animals and plants.

3
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,610
Each individual locked in its
own life-long fight for survival.

4
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:37,210
Everywhere you look, on land or in
the ocean, there are extraordinary

5
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:41,510
examples of the lengths living
things go to to stay alive.

6
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,010
This is the coast of Florida.

7
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,710
Here, strange scars on the sea bed

8
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:56,210
hint at one animal's
remarkable strategy.

9
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:03,610
These are bottlenose dolphins,

10
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,610
one of the most intelligent
animals on Earth.

11
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:13,010
Their prey is very elusive,
fast-swimming fish.

12
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:18,110
But the dolphins have invented
a completely new way of hunting.

13
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:26,410
By beating its tail down hard, this
dolphin stirs up the shallow silt.

14
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:36,010
And by swimming in a tight circle

15
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:40,110
it creates a ring of mushrooming
mud around a shoal of fish.

16
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,020
The contracting ring traps
the fish just like a net.

17
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,020
Panicked, the fish jump to escape.

18
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,820
Right into the open mouths
of the waiting dolphins.

19
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,920
Again and again, the lead
dolphin creates a circle,

20
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,820
before they all line up
with perfect timing.

21
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:05,030
These dolphins are the only ones
known to have developed this hunting
behaviour and it gives them an edge.

22
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:14,130
This sort of advantage may mean the
difference between life and death

23
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,230
in the survival of the fittest.

24
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:26,230
This series reveals the most
spectacular and extraordinary

25
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:31,030
strategies that animals and plants
have developed to stay alive.

26
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,340
For every creature, every
day is full of challenges,

27
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:15,540
all of which must be overcome,
somehow, in order to survive.

28
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,040
Kenya, famous for its big cats.

29
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,940
The supreme hunters.

30
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:49,240
Cheetahs specialise in hunting at speed.

31
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,940
Though fast, they are fragile creatures,

32
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,840
built to sprint after small prey.

33
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,240
They don't have the strength
or weight of a lion

34
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,740
to bring down larger animals.

35
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,940
This male is different.

36
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,340
He doesn't hunt alone. He's learnt
that there is strength in numbers.

37
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:28,250
But here there are not just
two, but three cheetahs.

38
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,250
A band of brothers.

39
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:41,050
They have changed their
tactics and, by doing so,

40
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,950
have taken their prey by surprise.

41
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,150
They have learnt that working together

42
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,650
they can bring down large prey.

43
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,750
An ostrich.

44
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:00,050
A bird that towers over a cheetah
and is more than twice as heavy.

45
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:06,450
It can't fly to escape danger, but
it can lash out with a deadly kick.

46
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:12,050
A female, unaware as yet, of any danger.

47
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:21,550
Even with three of them
this is still highly risky.

48
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:26,850
If one gets injured the other two
couldn't hope to tackle such large prey.

49
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,460
On the other hand, if they
get it right, the rewards

50
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,760
are huge.

51
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,660
The male has spotted one of
the brothers, but only one.

52
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,260
It's not too worried.

53
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,260
Then suddenly there are three!

54
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,460
The female is slower
to realise the danger

55
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,560
and the cheetahs switch targets.

56
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:57,370
It takes the combined effort and
weight of all three brothers
to bring down this powerful bird.

57
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,970
Even now the ostrich
could land a fatal kick.

58
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:11,070
So far, the brothers are winning.

59
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:14,270
Ostriches have yet to find
a way to foil such tactics.

60
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:22,570
Other animals have also evolved
surprising tactics to outmanoeuvre

61
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:27,470
the enemy, not with brute strength
but with extraordinary weapons.

62
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,470
Madagascar.

63
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:36,070
A strange world where
nothing is quite as it seems.

64
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:50,870
To hunt here requires
stealth and subterfuge.

65
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,180
And living within the trees
is a master of ambush.

66
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,880
A preying mantis.

67
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,080
Well camouflaged and lightning quick,

68
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,080
these insects are highly
efficient predators.

69
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,980
But even they are outgunned.

70
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,680
A chameleon.

71
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:42,580
Its camouflage is exceptional
because it can change its skin
colour to match its surroundings.

72
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,080
Its eyes move
independently to spot prey.

73
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,380
It creeps towards to its
victim, until just in range.

74
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:10,390
Then it unleashes a super weapon.

75
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:15,490
Its tongue shoots out at
15 metres per second.

76
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:24,290
And not only hits,
but grasps its target.

77
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42,690
But few hunters are always successful.

78
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:46,490
For them a hunt is just one meal.

79
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:48,290
For prey, the stakes are higher.

80
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,890
It's life...or death.

81
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:11,490
As Antarctica moves from spring
into summer, the inlets and bays,
once choked with ice, become free.

82
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,200
And animals move in to feed.

83
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,400
These are crabeater seals.

84
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:37,400
They don't actually eat crabs, but
krill, small shrimps that swarm
in their billions in these waters.

85
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,900
Resting on a large ice floe,
these crabeaters are safe.

86
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,700
But as soon as they enter the
water, they are on their guard,

87
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,500
for good reason.

88
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,600
Killer whales.

89
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Here in Antarctica, many killer
whales prey only on fish.

90
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:31,310
But these whales are different,
they specialise in hunting seals.

91
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:50,910
This seal swimming to open water is
unaware of the danger heading his way.

92
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,310
Until now.

93
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:06,710
He's in real trouble. There is no
escape unless he can hide behind
this small piece of floating ice.

94
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,110
But he's been spotted and surrounded.

95
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,120
Now agility is his only chance.

96
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,320
He dodges for his life, staying as
close as he can to the iceberg.

97
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,120
He's tiring.

98
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,620
And the whales tighten the
circle, going for the kill.

99
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,620
But hunters don't always
get their own way.

100
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,520
In the end, the seal's
determination and skill, using

101
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:51,330
the ice for protection,
kept him just out of reach.

102
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,930
And the whales move on.

103
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:04,630
Recently it's been observed
that killer whales

104
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:08,330
are much more successful when
hunting other types of seal.

105
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:12,730
Crabeaters like this put
up too much of a fight.

106
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:32,230
For creatures living in the
open ocean there is nowhere
to hide from predators.

107
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,930
But there is safety in numbers.

108
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:04,640
One fish, however, has evolved
a different escape tactic.

109
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:12,540
To leave the water completely,
take to the air and fly!

110
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:23,140
After a huge effort to
get airborne, flying fish

111
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,940
can glide 200 metres or so, to
escape the predators chasing them.

112
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:17,350
Not all animals are hunters,
many are vegetarians.

113
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:22,450
But the battle between animals
and plants can also be intense.

114
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:28,350
Boa Vista, central Brazil.

115
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:35,150
This valley is peppered with
strangely pitted rocks.

116
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:54,650
These are not natural formations
but the legacy of a long struggle
between one animal and one plant.

117
00:17:56,550 --> 00:18:01,650
Brown-tufted capuchins,
highly intelligent monkeys.

118
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:05,150
They spend their nights
in the safety of caves,

119
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,750
emerging each morning to find food.

120
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:17,050
Down in the valley is
a particular favourite.

121
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:19,150
A nut palm.

122
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:24,850
The palms produce huge seeds,
but they have very strong shells

123
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,360
that protect them against
attack from hungry animals.

124
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:39,960
For the capuchins this
is a war of attrition.

125
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:48,260
They check which seed is the
ripest, and the battle commences.

126
00:18:54,460 --> 00:19:00,560
The first job is to tear the
tough fibrous husk from the nut.

127
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,160
He doesn't try to crack
the nut straight away,

128
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,260
but drops it to the ground.

129
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:16,160
He's learnt that a nut should be
given a week or so drying in the sun.

130
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,660
These are ones he prepared earlier.

131
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,960
He taps them to see if they're ready.

132
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:37,270
This huge flat rock is his anvil.

133
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,170
And this is a hammer.

134
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:57,370
It's made of a different and
much harder rock than the anvil.

135
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:03,270
Now something extraordinary happens.

136
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:20,770
The capuchins' use of these stone
tools requires an exceptional level

137
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:24,170
of intelligence, planning and dexterity.

138
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:43,370
The nut finally cracks and
exposes a rich, oily kernel.

139
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:55,280
Youngsters watch and imitate the
adults, just as human toddlers do.

140
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,480
If they are to become independent,

141
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:00,080
they must learn to crack their own nuts.

142
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:11,580
But the learning process is
long, with many frustrations.

143
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:18,780
They learn early on that
to do a job properly,

144
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,280
you need the right tool.

145
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,180
It can take eight years for
a capuchin to master this art

146
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:37,980
and overcome the palm's
formidable defences.

147
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:53,780
But some plants have turned
the tables and feed on animals.

148
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:03,490
This is a highly
sophisticated trap. The bait,

149
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:08,390
sugary nectar around
the rim of the disc.

150
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:16,190
The triggers, fine hairs, two
of which have to be touched
within 20 seconds of each other.

151
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:30,390
The victim, a fly which finds the
colour and nectar irresistible.

152
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,190
One.

153
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:53,790
Two.

154
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:07,890
When triggered, the trap snaps shut
so fast that the fly is imprisoned.

155
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,300
The Venus flytrap now
slowly digests its victim.

156
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,800
Life's challenges are more
than just finding food.

157
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:46,200
In every animal's life there comes a
time when its mind turns to breeding.

158
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,200
One creature's approach
is mind-boggling.

159
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,000
Malaysia.

160
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:16,200
This strange insect has been
lying dormant on the forest floor.

161
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:54,110
Once safe in the trees, these males
hide among the leaves and begin
an extraordinary transformation.

162
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:59,910
One that will make the difference
between fathering offspring or not.

163
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:08,610
He begins by gulping in air bubbles,
forcing them up into his head.

164
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:14,610
He then pumps the bubbles into
the stalks supporting his eyes,

165
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:16,610
just like blowing up a balloon.

166
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:27,610
And this is what earns
these creatures their name,

167
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:29,610
the stalk-eyed fly.

168
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:50,320
A few final adjustments to
straighten out any remaining creases

169
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,420
and he's ready for action.

170
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:02,820
They may look unwieldy, but eyes on
stalks improve not only his ability

171
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:07,820
to spot predators, but they are key
when it comes to winning females.

172
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:25,120
In the evening both males and females
gather and the males begin to size
one another up, eyeball to eyeball.

173
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:31,220
Having the widest eye span puts you
at the top of the pecking order.

174
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:37,620
The eye stalks are not weapons,
they're measuring sticks,

175
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:42,620
used to gauge how big, and
so how strong, a male is.

176
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:46,720
But there's trouble if two top males
have exactly the same eye width.

177
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:51,130
Then the contest descends into a brawl.

178
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:05,030
Defeated.

179
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:10,430
The winner. He now has the right to
mate with all the females nearby.

180
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:24,230
The rather gentlemanly way stalk-eyed
flies settle their differences
over females is not the only way.

181
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:26,330
Some animals are much more violent.

182
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:30,430
It's the dry season in Zambia.

183
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:40,430
The lagoons are either baked dry,
or the mud is so thick animals
get stuck, with fatal consequences.

184
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:49,730
This male hippo has been living in
one small lagoon, but as it dries,
it's turning into a death trap.

185
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:56,430
Understandably, the females that once
shared it with him have all left.

186
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:04,040
Even if he wants to, he
can't stay much longer.

187
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:08,140
He needs water to keep cool
and females to mate with.

188
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,240
And this is where they all are.

189
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:20,440
Almost all the hippos in
the area are in what is
left of the Luangwa River,

190
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,540
because it's the last place
where there's still deep water.

191
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,140
This bend is controlled
by an all-powerful male.

192
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:35,340
Since the drought many more
females have joined his herd.

193
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:49,640
They are happy to live cheek by
jowl, but any male who comes here

194
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,740
in the hope of mating must
first defeat the overlord.

195
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:10,240
The wandering male arrives and has a
decision to make - submit or fight.

196
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:23,460
Victory for the overlord.

197
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:30,460
His domination of his channel in
the river remains and with it
mating rights with the females.

198
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:41,560
The loser is alive, but is an outcast.

199
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:47,460
He retreats to another part of
the river where it's so shallow
that no females will follow.

200
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:54,460
His chance to father
offspring is over for now.

201
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:05,360
For some animals the challenges
of breeding are not about
fighting but about courtship.

202
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:16,060
Among birds, displays, songs and
rituals can reach extraordinary
levels of complexity and beauty.

203
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:27,460
During spring, on the
freshwater lakes of Oregon,

204
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:30,060
grebes join together to
renew their partnership.

205
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:48,870
The ceremony starts with a
series of graceful duets,

206
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:52,570
in which one partner echoes
the actions of the other.

207
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:02,370
But the real test comes now.

208
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:06,270
Only the strongest and the most faithful

209
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:10,570
are prepared to join together
for the final exultant dance.

210
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:09,580
Those animals which have young now
face a whole new set of challenges,

211
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:12,480
to protect and nurture their offspring.

212
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:21,980
In the cold waters of the northern
Pacific Ocean, there lives a giant.

213
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:32,680
A giant Pacific octopus
at over four metres long.

214
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,280
She is hunting, not for
prey, but for a den.

215
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,180
Somewhere to settle down and hide.

216
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:57,490
Her den has to be just right.

217
00:33:57,590 --> 00:34:01,690
She's going to live here
for the rest of her life.

218
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:07,090
She's carrying fertilised eggs,

219
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:11,190
and now, happy and
settled, she lays them.

220
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:15,590
100,000 of them.

221
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:27,290
Over the next six months she
carefully tends her precious brood.

222
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:32,590
She caresses them with her arms

223
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:37,390
to keep them free of algae and
properly supplied with oxygen.

224
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:43,490
This is her first and only brood.

225
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:46,790
And so she takes great care of them.

226
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:51,290
While she's guarding her eggs
she doesn't leave the den.

227
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:53,090
Not once.

228
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:54,790
Unable to feed,

229
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:56,590
she is starving.

230
00:34:56,690 --> 00:35:03,390
Her last act of devotion
is to blow water over the
eggs to help them hatch.

231
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,300
Young, fully-developed octopus pop out.

232
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:35,100
Though only a few will survive
to adulthood, she's given
them the best chance she can.

233
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,500
After her long and lonely vigil,

234
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,600
she is dead.

235
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:49,800
Surely this sacrifice must make her
one of nature's most devoted mothers.

236
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,100
Here, 30 metres beneath the
Costa Rican forest canopy,
another dedicated mother

237
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:10,500
ensures that her young also have
the best possible start in life.

238
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:24,610
This tiny strawberry poison arrow
frog, only the size of a finger
nail, is guarding her fertilised eggs.

239
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:32,510
Whilst the eggs and tadpoles are
developing, she and her mate keep

240
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:36,710
watch, making sure that they
are safe from predators.

241
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:40,010
But they can't stay here for ever.

242
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:43,110
The leaf litter is drying
out and tadpoles need water.

243
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:46,710
She must do something, and fast.

244
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:59,410
She needs to move them and so encourages
one tadpole to climb on her back.

245
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:02,810
She now begins an epic journey.

246
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:07,110
But it's not to a pond,
as you might expect,

247
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:10,510
she is looking for
something very particular.

248
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:19,710
Her journey takes her across the
forest floor to the foot of a tall
tree and then she starts to climb.

249
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,520
For such a little frog
it is a marathon ascent,

250
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:43,520
like a human mother climbing
the Empire State Building
with a child on her back.

251
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:51,520
She's looking for a plant, a
bromeliad, growing on the tree.

252
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:04,620
It holds a pool of water at its
centre, the perfect nursery
pool for a developing tadpole.

253
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,520
In slides her youngster.

254
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,620
But this is only one of six tadpoles.

255
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,020
She must rush back down
to rescue the others.

256
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:34,420
One by one she collects them and
carries each to its own bromeliad.

257
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:00,130
But there is another problem.

258
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:02,530
The little pools contain no food.

259
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:08,530
So she has to provide it.

260
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:14,130
She lays an unfertilised egg in
each pool for her tadpoles to eat.

261
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:23,730
And then she leaves.

262
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:32,130
But one egg won't sustain
a growing tadpole for long,

263
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:36,330
so she has to return every
few days with another egg.

264
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:48,330
Over the next two weeks
she can climb almost half
a mile tending her young.

265
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:53,730
An astonishing feat for
such a tiny creature.

266
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:05,140
While she's busy delivering eggs,

267
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:09,440
the tadpole grows legs and
its tail begins to disappear.

268
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:15,640
And then one day it leaves
its bromeliad nursery for ever

269
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:18,740
and climbs out into the forest.

270
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:27,240
Whilst its mother has
a well-deserved rest.

271
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,440
Birds are also diligent parents.

272
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:39,840
Over their lifetime they invest
huge effort in just a few young.

273
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:47,640
But there is only so
much a parent can do.

274
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:57,040
All along the Antarctic peninsula
both male and female chinstrap
penguins have been commuting

275
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:00,940
daily from the open ocean to
collect food for their chicks.

276
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:14,750
Mouthfuls of krill, caught many
miles away at sea, are regurgitated.

277
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:27,450
But one day the chicks
wait in vain for food.

278
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:29,750
Their parents do not return.

279
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:34,650
The chicks now face life on their own.

280
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:38,350
This is the toughest
time in an animal's life

281
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:41,450
and some are not going to make it.

282
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:52,750
Over the next few days, driven
by hunger, the chicks make
their way down to the shore.

283
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:58,650
Instinct tells them they
have to head out to sea.

284
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:05,950
Built to withstand the cold,
they have already accumulated

285
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:10,650
a layer of fat, and their outer
feathers act as a waterproof shield.

286
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:15,250
But they still have to learn to swim.

287
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,160
The polar sea is challenging enough

288
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,560
but with a change in the wind,

289
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:47,160
a slick of broken ice
has choked the bay.

290
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,560
For any penguin this ice
presents a real problem.

291
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,560
But for the chicks it's a disaster.

292
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:09,960
They must get through this barrier to
the open water, if they are to feed.

293
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:19,060
One, perhaps hungrier or
braver than the rest,

294
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:24,360
leads the way and tries skittering
over the top, while the others watch.

295
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:31,170
The ice is hard to swim through,
and progress is painfully slow.

296
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:55,370
A leopard seal.

297
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:05,870
This chick never had the chance
to learn how to avoid the seal.

298
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:08,170
Its end is inevitable.

299
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:39,570
The leopard seal efficiently
flays the chick, tearing off
a small piece with each throw.

300
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:46,180
Others take their chance.

301
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:29,580
But the leopard seal is now
ready for its next victim.

302
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:52,080
It's a lottery, and the lucky
chicks make it out to open water.

303
00:45:56,690 --> 00:46:03,390
There is still an element of
chance in life which an
individual can do little about.

304
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:30,390
In the end, overcoming
life's challenges,

305
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:34,690
whether finding enough to eat
or outwitting your predators,

306
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:39,190
is only significant if life's
final challenge can be met.

307
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:54,690
From a tiny frog dedicating
weeks to her few cherished tadpoles,
to an orang-utan who spends

308
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:57,090
eight years bringing up her baby,

309
00:46:57,190 --> 00:47:01,590
individual animals strive to
reach this one ultimate goal,

310
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:08,200
to pass on their genes and to ensure
the survival of the next generation.

311
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,800
Ultimately, in nature,

312
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:17,400
that is what life is all about.

313
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,300
During the three years it took
to film Life, our camera crews

314
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:11,700
visited every continent on Earth, but
the most challenging was Antarctica.

315
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:17,610
Here filming was only possible

316
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:23,010
with the help of an extraordinary
range of people and organisations.

317
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:27,010
An Air Force jet delivering supplies
to McMurdo research station

318
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:32,810
ferried one of our crews
to the Ross Ice Shelf.

319
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:43,210
And on the other side of the
continent a team sailed for five days

320
00:48:43,310 --> 00:48:47,410
across the Drake Passage to
reach the Antarctic peninsular.

321
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:53,110
Once there, a small crew was
put ashore on Deception Island

322
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:57,410
to spend a month camping on
the edge of a penguin colony.

323
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:03,310
Two people and 200,000 penguins.

324
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:12,410
Another team joined scientists

325
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:14,810
drilling through the ice

326
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:17,610
to explore the beautiful
and bizarre world below.

327
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:42,620
But the hardiest and most ambitious
shoot involved four film crews,

328
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:47,020
a celebrated French yachtsman
and the Ministry of Defence.

329
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:53,620
The teams had a two-month window

330
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:58,520
to film Antarctica's two
top predators in action.

331
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:01,820
We knew that one could be
found prowling the coast of

332
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:07,720
Rosenthal Island, waiting for young
penguins to take their first plunge.

333
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:11,120
And the man to take us
there was Jerome Poncet.

334
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:18,320
He skippered the first yacht to sail
south of the Antarctic Circle and has
been back every year for the past 35.

335
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:21,320
He knows Antarctic
sailing like no-one else.

336
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:26,420
His yacht, the Golden Fleece,
is not an ice breaker,

337
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:30,420
but Jerome has his own unique
way of getting through.

338
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:34,420
He shunts one floe against another

339
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:37,520
to clear a way through
like playing marbles.

340
00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:40,830
Jerome, once he gets his teeth into,

341
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:43,930
into a situation he
doesn't like to let it go.

342
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:46,830
So, maybe we'll be here
for a few hours yet.

343
00:50:46,830 --> 00:50:50,830
Jerome is determined to
get through this channel.

344
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:53,230
We talk about hundred,
hundreds of tonnes,

345
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:57,630
maybe 1,000, 250,000 tonnes or more.

346
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:01,730
It's a pooling of water,
you have to push.

347
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:07,830
Some marbles are just too big.

348
00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:16,830
For now, Jerome is foiled and
has to moor for the night.

349
00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:21,030
For him, tying up to
100,000 tonnes of ice

350
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:24,430
is just another day at the office.

351
00:51:31,830 --> 00:51:36,630
Progress is slow, but they
need to get to Rosenthal
before the penguins leave.

352
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:42,330
They make it through and the
penguins are still there.

353
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:49,030
Chinstrap penguin chicks fledge
at a particular time of year.

354
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,140
The crew knew this would draw
leopard seals like a magnet.

355
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:58,340
Leopard seals are giants among
their kind, they have teeth

356
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:03,640
bigger than a lion and a mouth
that can open nearly 180 degrees.

357
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:05,640
How close can Doug get?

358
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:13,840
With this seal, very.

359
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:33,540
He loses interest in his reflection

360
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:36,640
and goes back to eating penguins.

361
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:49,640
That was very exciting.

362
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:52,440
He was a super seal,

363
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:55,440
super seal, gave me lots
of action nice and close,

364
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:59,840
but I must admit you do have
to feel sorry for the penguin,

365
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:00,940
just doesn't stand a chance.

366
00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:03,950
The team knew where to
find leopard seals,

367
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:06,450
but finding the other top predator

368
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:09,450
was going to be another matter entirely.

369
00:53:10,950 --> 00:53:14,550
Very little is known about
Antarctic killer whales.

370
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:16,950
Time to bring in reinforcements.

371
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:22,450
HMS Endurance,

372
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:26,250
the Royal Navy's ice patrol ship.

373
00:53:29,850 --> 00:53:35,650
She surveys Antarctic waters and
the crew see changes every year.

374
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:42,650
The latest chart of this area, we
are now six miles inside an ice
shelf, which just goes to show

375
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:48,950
how much retreation of this
ice shelf has occurred over
the past five or six years.

376
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:52,050
Would you get complications...?

377
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:55,950
Series producer Martha Holmes
and cameraman David Baillie

378
00:53:56,050 --> 00:54:00,850
were on board to find and film
the killer whales from the air.

379
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:04,450
Endurance carries two Lynx
helicopters used to assist

380
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:08,250
the British Antarctic Survey
and the Hydrographic Office.

381
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:09,250
On this trip,

382
00:54:09,350 --> 00:54:14,350
some time on one of the helicopters
is assigned to the Life team.

383
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:29,560
No-one has succeeded in filming
killer whales hunting off the
Antarctic peninsular before.

384
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:34,260
Our two teams have just a few
days when they can film together.

385
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:45,460
At water level the Golden
Fleece has exciting news.

386
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:49,460
They've found killer whales which
look as though they could be hunting.

387
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:55,260
And Navy 435, Navy 435, this is
Golden Fleece, Golden Fleece over.

388
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:01,560
{y:i}Copy that. We're on our way.

389
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:04,860
Guys, really windy, we'll be...

390
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:09,260
pretty lucky to stay with them
through this. But we can try though.

391
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:24,460
435, this is Golden Fleece, we
have lost sight of the orca.

392
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:31,170
The white.'Yeah, OK, they're in
direct line with that iceberg now,

393
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:34,670
{y:i}between us and the iceberg
{y:i}about 100 metres this side of it.

394
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:37,570
{y:i}Visual. Yeah, visual.

395
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:43,670
From the air, the helicopter team
can follow the killer whales
more easily than the boat team.

396
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:47,470
435, this is Golden
Fleece, full copy. Out.

397
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:57,770
By working together the helicopter
and yacht are able to keep track
of the whales in the rough sea.

398
00:55:57,770 --> 00:56:02,070
{y:i}There's four now actually
{y:i}yes, four, and four I can see.

399
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:06,370
A change in the weather gives
a chance to film at last.

400
00:56:07,370 --> 00:56:11,170
They've gone further up this way,
if we follow them that's good.

401
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:16,870
But will they hunt?

402
00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:18,770
OK, here they come through.

403
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:23,870
Oops, yeah, they 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, it's a good 12 huh, easy.

404
00:56:27,870 --> 00:56:32,870
Doug has spotted a crabeater
seal near some ice, buthave
the killer whales seen it?

405
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:37,980
No, just keep loosening
the square screen.

406
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:53,180
They have.

407
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,680
Some good action.

408
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,180
Can you go closer?

409
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:24,480
It's over, that's it, they've got him.

410
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,480
It's still there.

411
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:37,680
For a wildlife cameraman
there are always surprises.

412
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:45,080
It has taken two months, but they've
succeeded thanks to extraordinary

413
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:49,980
collaboration from an entire
ship's company to a lone skipper.

414
00:57:50,090 --> 00:57:56,490
Collaborations like this would be
the foundation of the whole three
years of filming across the world.
