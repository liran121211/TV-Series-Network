1
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,720
Ours is truly a blue planet.

2
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,680
Water covers most of the world's surface.

3
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,440
Here we are the outsiders.

4
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,960
But under the waves one group thrives.

5
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,040
Fish are masters of the waters.

6
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:27,190
And sailfish are the fastest of them all.

7
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:31,910
Their speed makes them one of the ocean's most fearsome predators.

8
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:41,870
Off the coast of Mexico, 30 sailfish have surrounded a ball of sardines.

9
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:52,430
To catch their prey requires more than speed alone.

10
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:01,710
In the tightest turns, fins maintain stability.

11
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:05,190
Their sickle-shaped tail powers them forwards

12
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:09,830
and that extraordinary dorsal fin helps intimidate their prey.

13
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:21,310
To the naked eye, the action is too fast,

14
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,710
slowed, their challenge becomes clear.

15
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:29,270
Just picking a target is hard enough.

16
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,910
Knocking it off balance, separates it from the shoal.

17
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:38,670
This requires extraordinary skill.

18
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:12,470
Not every attempt is successful.

19
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:22,110
But as more sailfish join in, when one misses another takes its place.

20
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,900
The shoal of sardines is methodically wiped out.

21
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:43,940
Sailfish are top predators, very little threatens them.

22
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,860
But for the majority of fish this is not the case.

23
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:57,020
For most fish the open ocean is extremely dangerous.

24
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,140
And some go to extraordinary lengths just to survive.

25
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,340
Flying fish.

26
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,380
Free of the water they soar on elongated fins,

27
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:29,980
leaving their predators far behind.

28
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,860
A flight of fish.

29
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:03,540
Escaping predators is not the only test facing the flying fish.

30
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,500
They must also protect their developing young.

31
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:17,980
These flying fish are searching for the one thing that will make this possible.

32
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:23,500
In such a vast ocean it's not easy.

33
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,460
They're in luck.

34
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,300
A palm frond.

35
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,460
It's a tiny island adrift in a huge ocean.

36
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:44,340
And like an island it offers shelter, not for the flying fish,

37
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,220
but for their eggs.

38
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:54,330
The females lay eggs on the raft, where the males fertilise them.

39
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:05,370
The first fish spawn and this triggers the others to start.

40
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:19,530
Soon thousands join the melee.

41
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:27,450
Innumerable strands of eggs are laid.

42
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:33,370
The raft starts to tilt under their weight.

43
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:04,090
The best place to lay eggs is right inside the frond.

44
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:11,930
For some the attempt proves fatal and living fish become entombed.

45
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:25,890
The raft starts to sink under the weight of so many eggs.

46
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:33,130
But this is far from a disaster.

47
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:39,490
Sinking away from the surface actually improves the eggs' chances of survival.

48
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:43,730
In just a few days, having been safely hidden in the depths,

49
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,090
they'll hatch out.

50
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:53,050
Other fish protect their offspring in different ways.

51
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:56,690
Some go to far greater lengths to care for them.

52
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,280
The shallow waters of southern Australia

53
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,160
are home to many strange creatures.

54
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,280
It's a fairytale world of sea horses...

55
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,200
..stargazers...

56
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,080
..and stingrays.

57
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:51,000
But none compare with the beauty of the weedy sea dragon.

58
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,680
The dragon's tiny fins beat frantically

59
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,000
to prevent the current from sweeping it away.

60
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,640
It's the beginning of spring,

61
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,760
the season when sea dragons begin their courtship.

62
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,920
And in the evening light, they start to dance.

63
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:04,480
In a graceful duet, each partner mirrors the actions of the other.

64
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:46,790
Darkness will soon draw a veil over the pair

65
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:50,430
but they will dance on, into the night.

66
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:06,830
Two months later, and the result of their courtship is revealed.

67
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:20,470
It's the male and he's the one that's carrying the eggs,

68
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:24,390
with rows and rows of them embedded in his tail.

69
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:30,910
That night the female transferred her eggs to him.

70
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:33,990
Since then, the male alone has cared for them.

71
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:39,630
By carrying them with him he's kept them safe.

72
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:54,310
And now it's time for his efforts to be rewarded.

73
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:00,030
The eggs are ready to hatch.

74
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:13,430
In the calm of a summer morning

75
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:18,830
a baby sea dragon, with yolk sac still attached, is born.

76
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,060
The weed bed shelters older dragons

77
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,420
that are already able to feed themselves.

78
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,700
Although these dragons were well cared for by their father,

79
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,740
now they must find their own way in the world.

80
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,420
There are fish, however,

81
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:02,140
which provide their young with a safe refuge for far longer.

82
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,300
The south western Pacific.

83
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,380
A convict fish

84
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:17,700
and it's something of a marine architect.

85
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:24,300
Underground it has created a labyrinth of tunnels.

86
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:29,420
This adult never ventures out of its burrow, what it eats is a mystery.

87
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:39,300
But it doesn't live here alone.

88
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:43,820
At another entrance faces peer out.

89
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,460
Juvenile convict fish.

90
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:52,740
Unlike their parent, the youngsters are not tied to the burrow.

91
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:01,380
And as they start to emerge, a trickle becomes a flood of fish.

92
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,740
There are thousands of them.

93
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,340
And they all help with the chores.

94
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,660
Many hands make light work.

95
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:56,970
The young fish swarm together.

96
00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:00,250
Thousands of mouths gulping plankton.

97
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:14,290
What the adults eat must somehow involve these youngsters.

98
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:21,610
Whether the young feed their parents by regurgitating food

99
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:25,770
or through some other mechanism, we just don't know.

100
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:28,690
Whatever the answer, the youngsters provide

101
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:33,970
their parents with a meal and in return get a roof over their heads.

102
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:47,770
Producing young is just one challenge.

103
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:53,490
Finding food and somewhere to live are further trials fish must face.

104
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:01,370
The Californian coast, a wide range of species live here.

105
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:09,610
But all this life means competition for living space is intense.

106
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:24,770
Old shells are highly prized.

107
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:34,330
And this one is occupied by a sarcastic fringehead.

108
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:38,170
These fish are exceptionally quarrelsome,

109
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:41,370
they have to be, to defend their living space.

110
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,320
An octopus.

111
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,840
Inadvertently it's wandered into the fringehead's territory

112
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,400
and that can't be tolerated.

113
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,280
The octopus's impressive jab holds the fringehead at bay.

114
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,680
There is more to this behaviour than being bad-tempered.

115
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:52,120
The fringehead needs to defend its patch if it is to get enough to eat

116
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,720
and the octopus was competition.

117
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,680
Crabs are not the easiest of mouthfuls.

118
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:15,240
Because of the shortage of living space there are constant boundary disputes,

119
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,320
especially with other fringeheads

120
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,280
and this one has got too close.

121
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,640
Despite the most extravagant threats...

122
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,640
..neither is prepared to back down.

123
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:07,400
Success, and it's quick to get back to its shell.

124
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,960
A fringehead can never drop its guard, there's too much competition.

125
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:24,790
Some fish have moved to places where they have fewer rivals.

126
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:44,350
A mudskipper a fish that spends most of its life out of the sea.

127
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:50,190
It can walk on land and breathe air.

128
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:55,070
Its life is very different from that of most fish.

129
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:04,270
A fish out of water maybe,

130
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,670
but they thrive here in Japan.

131
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:13,950
So what's made this upheaval worthwhile?

132
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,630
The answer lies in the mud.

133
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:27,470
As the tide retreats it exposes mudflats.

134
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:34,030
Sunlight hits the rich silt and tiny plants and animals flourish there.

135
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:39,190
All food for a mudskipper.

136
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:42,870
But life on land is not without problems,

137
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,590
it's hard work to find a mate.

138
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:57,230
Jumping high above the mud will get you noticed.

139
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,830
With eyes perched on top of their heads

140
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:22,030
the mudskippers keep a look out for both friend and foe.

141
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:27,430
And males fight those who intrude on their territory.

142
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:52,660
They must also take care not to dry out in the sun.

143
00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:01,260
Rolling in the ooze keeps the skin cool and moist.

144
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,260
For this smaller species,

145
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:09,780
a better option is to retreat underground.

146
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:19,340
So he digs himself a tunnel down into the mud.

147
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:37,260
His heap of spoil is an indication of the extent of his excavations.

148
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:55,220
With the tide flooding the tunnel twice a day,

149
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:58,860
maintenance is a real burden.

150
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:08,700
The tunnel is more than a refuge from the sun,

151
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:12,060
it serves another very important purpose.

152
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:18,380
The tunnel is actually U-shaped and at the far end is a sealed chamber,

153
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:22,260
the walls of which are lined with eggs.

154
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:29,660
The eggs are kept in air as it's richer in oxygen than the water.

155
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:34,660
The problem is the air that's trapped here won't last for long.

156
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:41,060
So the male travels to the open end of the tunnel to gulp fresh air.

157
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:45,410
Back he goes down his tunnel where he releases it into the egg chamber.

158
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:52,250
Replenishing the oxygen on which the eggs depend.

159
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:59,250
He will repeat this hundreds and hundreds of times until his young hatch.

160
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:07,730
This lifestyle is very demanding,

161
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:12,770
yet the mudskipper has found a way around every problem.

162
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:21,690
The harsh challenges of life in the ocean

163
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:26,210
have encouraged other fish to leave the sea.

164
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:29,850
Not for land, but for fresh water.

165
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:35,290
Hawaii is the remotest island chain on the planet.

166
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:40,850
These pools look the perfect place for a fish to live,

167
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:44,130
secluded and free from competition and predators.

168
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:51,610
Yet few contain fish, for one very considerable reason.

169
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:17,850
Surely no fish could swim up this.

170
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:25,170
But one fish comes from the ocean, intent on colonising these streams.

171
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:32,570
It's a tiny goby and it's a rock climber.

172
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:40,930
With pelvic fins fused into a disc, which acts like a sucker,

173
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:44,890
all the goby needs is a film of water to climb through.

174
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,280
The pioneer is soon followed by many others,

175
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,440
possibly following its scent trail.

176
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:30,240
They clamber on, ever upwards against the flow.

177
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,080
Drops of water fall like bombs.

178
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,440
False leads waste crucial energy.

179
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,720
Some must rest.

180
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,400
For others, the effort is just too much.

181
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,960
Many die in their attempt to reach to top.

182
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:47,760
Against all the odds a few heroic individuals do make it to the top.

183
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,680
They find themselves in a near-perfect fish habitat...

184
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:08,440
..where the gobies can feed and grow and breed in peace.

185
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:17,430
In time their own young will be swept downstream and out to sea

186
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:21,230
and the cycle will begin all over again.

187
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:39,870
Fresh water presents particular challenges for fish.

188
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:43,990
Nutrients can be in very short supply in spring water,

189
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:48,710
so here fish must take every chance they can to find food.

190
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:54,230
The rain that falls on these Kenyan hills percolates through the rocks.

191
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:59,430
Finally emerging as crystal clear pools.

192
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:11,550
Pools that are home to fish including barbel.

193
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:19,430
The fish share these waters with all sorts of creatures...

194
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:33,590
..including hippopotamus.

195
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:46,830
These giant vegetarians are no threat to the fish,

196
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:50,150
in fact they're key to their survival here.

197
00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:00,790
After a night of grazing on land, these hippos return

198
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:03,630
to spend the daylight hours in the cooling waters.

199
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:21,270
And the barbel come to meet them.

200
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:32,180
Soon each hippo is trailed by a shoal of fish,

201
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,980
waiting for their breakfast.

202
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:39,780
Hippo droppings.

203
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:51,340
But it's not just the hippo's dung the fish are interested in.

204
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:59,580
When the hippos reach one particular spot in the pool,

205
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:02,060
they stand still and wait.

206
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:08,700
And the fish start to clean them...

207
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:16,860
..removing ticks, parasites and other tasty morsels.

208
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:23,780
To the fish the hippos are a mobile cafeteria.

209
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:32,340
The hippos seem to be enjoying the sensation.

210
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,540
The only thing that interrupts the feast

211
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:41,820
is the need to take an occasional breath.

212
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:53,020
Cleaning the hippo's skin was just the hors d'oeuvre.

213
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:56,860
Now it's time for the main course.

214
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:07,620
So, in addition to providing skin care,

215
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:10,580
the fish look after the hippos' dental hygiene.

216
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:14,220
It's an arrangement that suits both parties.

217
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:24,940
But perhaps it is the fish that are the overall winners.

218
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:28,780
For, thanks to the hippos, they are able to feed on

219
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:32,780
the abundant vegetation that would otherwise be beyond their reach,

220
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:36,300
growing around their pool, on land.

221
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:43,570
Providing a cleaning service is clearly a good way of getting a meal.

222
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:49,890
And there is cleaning to be done in the sea as well.

223
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:10,290
The life of this wrasse is centred on removing parasites from other reef fish...

224
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:18,090
..including predatory jacks.

225
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:27,570
Normally they would snap up such a little fish,

226
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:30,010
but this is an established relationship

227
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,890
and both sides know the rules.

228
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:40,250
With so many jacks and only a few wrasse in attendance,

229
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:43,050
not all the jacks are going to get cleaned.

230
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:51,090
But all this life attracts other predators.

231
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:54,930
Silvertip sharks.

232
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:14,890
The reef provides shelter for the smaller fish,

233
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:17,370
but the jacks remain exposed.

234
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:19,370
Yet this may be a chance

235
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:24,210
for the jacks to solve their cleaning problem.

236
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:26,170
They've spotted an opportunity.

237
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:46,330
Sharks have skin like sand paper.

238
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:48,770
And bumping into the sharks' flanks

239
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:54,530
helps the jacks to rid themselves of parasites and dead skin.

240
00:34:54,560 --> 00:35:00,640
Perhaps the jacks find this a more effective alternative to the cleaner fish.

241
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:05,000
And soon swarms of jacks pursue the sharks.

242
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,240
All itching to have a scratch.

243
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:17,800
Unsurprisingly all this attention bothers the sharks

244
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:22,320
and they head back to the blue water,

245
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:27,160
leaving the residents of the reef to resume life as normal.

246
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:40,160
Coral reefs are the richest habitats on Earth.

247
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,280
It's not surprising that,

248
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,000
with so many different kinds of animals living so closely together,

249
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:49,400
some extraordinary relationships have evolved.

250
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:57,840
A clownfish, a small and defenceless resident of the reef.

251
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,960
It seems to have picked a tough place to live,

252
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,720
amongst the tentacles of a sea anemone.

253
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:13,040
Each tentacle is armed with paralysing stings that can kill a fish.

254
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:19,040
Yet the clown fish are totally immune.

255
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:22,120
For this pair, the anemone is like a castle.

256
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,840
So long as they stay surrounded by the tentacles, they're safe

257
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:31,560
and so this is where they choose to lay their eggs.

258
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,360
After carefully selecting the site,

259
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,680
work begins on preparing the surface.

260
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,720
Both fish share in the labour,

261
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:59,800
though it's the larger female who decides when all is ready.

262
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:07,040
Lines and lines of tiny eggs are stuck to the rock and then fertilised.

263
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:26,110
They're laid so close to the anemone they will be safe.

264
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:33,190
And for the next seven days they'll receive constant care...

265
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:36,950
..much of which is provided by the male.

266
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:43,950
His seemingly obsessive concern for the eggs is for good reason.

267
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:47,790
His position in the anemone is far from secure.

268
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:53,190
The female watches his every move,

269
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:56,670
she's in charge here and if his efforts don't match up

270
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:59,350
to her standards, she'll get rid of him.

271
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:09,310
In line to take over are a host of immature clown fish...

272
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:15,550
..each waiting to move up the hierarchy.

273
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:26,310
For the male the best way to stay in the female's favour

274
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:29,030
is by lavishing care on the eggs.

275
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:36,310
So he focuses all his efforts on keeping them clean and healthy.

276
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:45,390
The eggs grow rapidly and soon their tiny beating hearts are visible.

277
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:49,150
It seems he's done a good job.

278
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:05,190
Clown fish can hide away within an anemone.

279
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:10,790
But most fish don't have this option.

280
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:13,830
For some, the only way of avoiding danger

281
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:16,870
is by hiding amongst their own kind...

282
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,500
..in shoals.

283
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:39,500
Packed close together, no one anchovy stands out.

284
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:44,180
By sensing and reacting to the movements

285
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:48,300
of their immediate neighbours, thousands can move as one.

286
00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:00,940
For a predator, picking out an individual becomes nearly impossible.

287
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:22,260
The shoal's unity is its strength.

288
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:53,500
Yet each fish is acting from selfish motives.

289
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:01,580
Moving together, the fish confuse the sea lions so much

290
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:06,900
that they leave to look elsewhere for a smaller, less tricky target.

291
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:10,860
The sheer size of the shoal defeated the sea lions,

292
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:14,380
but there are fish that can overcome such strategies.

293
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,900
Off the coast of South Africa

294
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:24,260
this huge shoal of sardines is shadowed by a ragged tooth shark.

295
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:33,900
Other sharks join the menacing escort.

296
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:42,250
The shoal has been driven into the shallows by a cold ocean current.

297
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:47,170
And this gives the sharks an opportunity.

298
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:53,530
Hundreds have moved into position.

299
00:41:57,690 --> 00:42:01,770
Sharks have a special sense, they can detect

300
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:06,170
the electrical signals their prey gives off when it moves.

301
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:13,890
It's a sixth sense that can give them an edge.

302
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:21,490
But with hundreds of thousands of fish crammed into the shallows,

303
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:25,170
the sharks now need only rely on their speed and agility.

304
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:31,650
As the first shark starts to hunt in earnest,

305
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:35,290
a feeding frenzy breaks out.

306
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:45,850
The shoal's defences are weakened,

307
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:49,130
there isn't enough space to manoeuvre.

308
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:53,770
And the sharks can gorge themselves.

309
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:00,690
Despite the casualties,

310
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:06,170
the shoal is so vast that the sharks have little effect on its size.

311
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:17,610
Fish not only come together in great shoals for defence,

312
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:20,530
but at other critical times in their lives,

313
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:22,530
when they're ready to spawn.

314
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:28,770
These events only occur for a few days each year.

315
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:38,170
Snapper are normally solitary, but they've travelled here

316
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:42,490
from hundreds of miles away to gather off the coast of Belize.

317
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:52,330
Along this one reef, cubera, dog and mutton snapper form huge shoals.

318
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:04,760
60 metres down, there is an eerie coolness to the scene.

319
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,280
But things are about to hot up.

320
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:22,280
It's the evening of the full moon, the tides are just right.

321
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:32,800
A great column of fish leaves the bottom.

322
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:37,240
As they rise through the water, small groups break free of the shoal.

323
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:52,360
Each burst is led by a female, with the males racing behind.

324
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,000
As she sheds her eggs, they add their sperm to the mix.

325
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,880
By synchronising the time when they gather together,

326
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:22,840
the maximum numbers of fish can join in this mass spawning.

327
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,160
Millions of fertilized eggs are released,

328
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:41,000
cast into the ocean currents...

329
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:48,320
..and straight into a dangerous world.

330
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:58,760
Whale sharks, the largest fish on Earth.

331
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:09,190
Each shark might weigh ten tonnes

332
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:15,270
yet they feed on the tiniest creatures, including snapper eggs.

333
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:32,830
Life is being created, sustained and destroyed simultaneously

334
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:34,750
in one huge event.

335
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:42,150
The struggle for life, encapsulated into a single moment.

336
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:49,750
The oceans are perilous places to live,

337
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:53,830
yet fish have developed the most extraordinary means for survival.

338
00:46:56,030 --> 00:47:00,670
Their astounding diversity, the product of millions of years

339
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:03,910
of evolution, has enabled them to triumph.

340
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:14,510
Dominating the one habitat that we have so far failed to make our own.

341
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:44,670
Filming under water raised all sorts of problems for the Life team.

342
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:50,510
Not least of which was that they were only able to experience

343
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:56,790
the underwater world for as long as the air on their backs or in their lungs held out.

344
00:47:56,830 --> 00:48:02,270
But over three years the team were lucky enough to capture on film

345
00:48:02,310 --> 00:48:05,990
some extraordinary moments in the lives of fish.

346
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:21,500
The waters off the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico

347
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:24,620
are a rich hunting ground for Sailfish.

348
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:33,220
Cameraman Rick Rosenthal

349
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:36,860
has teamed up with sport fishing Captain Anthony Mendillo

350
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:40,980
to try and film the hunting behaviour of these amazing animals.

351
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:42,620
It's fish!

352
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:46,820
Feeding birds lead them to the sailfish.

353
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:49,140
Right here.Right here.

354
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:51,660
Getting to the bait balls and into the water quickly is key,

355
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:53,740
before the feast is consumed.

356
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:58,020
Get ready.

357
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:02,820
Everybody hang on.

358
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:07,940
Let's go swimming, now, now.

359
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:12,060
Go on get in there.

360
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:14,780
It's all very well telling Rick to hurry

361
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:19,180
but these fish are capable of swimming at over 60 miles an hour.

362
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:23,940
Just keeping up with them is hard enough.

363
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:44,740
Getting right in amongst the action is vital,

364
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:47,740
but Rick has to try to avoid becoming part of it.

365
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:55,460
Bills nearly one metre long, scything through the water at break neck speed

366
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,740
are guaranteed to get the heart racing.

367
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:09,060
But Rick holds his nerve

368
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:13,940
as the sailfish pick off sardine after sardine right in front of him.

369
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:26,660
Almost as soon as it started, it was all over.

370
00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:34,730
That was a wild feed show out there today.

371
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:36,130
Really wild.

372
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:39,610
Must have been 50 sailfish if there was...

373
00:50:39,650 --> 00:50:45,130
Or 49, but very aggressive fish, very hungry, everybody on the move

374
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:47,890
and I had to just keep kicking and kicking and kicking

375
00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:51,090
and kicking and kicking and kicking to keep in the action,

376
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:54,050
because after a while the sardine patch was eaten up

377
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:58,090
to just a little sliver and then it was over.

378
00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:02,090
Nearly 2,000 miles away on the other side of the Caribbean

379
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:05,450
another crew is taking a slightly different approach.

380
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:08,290
They are trying to film flying fish.

381
00:51:10,890 --> 00:51:16,450
The team sets out at dawn on the Hog Snapper, a commercial fishing boat.

382
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:22,170
Conditions are in stark contrast to the gleaming sport fishing boat in Mexico.

383
00:51:24,730 --> 00:51:26,850
There's Doug he's ready for action, look.

384
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:40,730
They are hoping to use a local fisherman's expertise to put them in the right place at the right time.

385
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:45,730
Yeah, Roger that. All you catching there's food.

386
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:48,610
You catching dinner, lunch and breakfast.

387
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:55,130
It's not a big boat and the crew's bedroom has now become the kitchen.

388
00:51:55,170 --> 00:51:58,010
We're having fried bacon and fried egg this morning.

389
00:51:58,050 --> 00:51:59,530
Fried bacon and fried eggs.

390
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:03,810
I'm the trainee chef and I don't...

391
00:52:03,850 --> 00:52:07,130
So I don't get to wear the white wellies.

392
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:15,090
Rather than racing around the ocean chasing the action,

393
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:17,770
the flying fish team have to sit it out

394
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:20,490
and wait for the fish to come to them.

395
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:25,730
Flying fish will spawn onto debris in the water

396
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:28,130
and the team tie on to a floating palm frond

397
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:32,890
to try and make sure they're close by in case the action begins.

398
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:36,690
And sure enough, they don't have long to wait.

399
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:52,920
Thousands of fish have massed below the surface,

400
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,640
all intent on reaching the frond.

401
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:04,000
And the frond is not the only thing

402
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:06,760
that they're trying to lay their eggs on.

403
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:32,440
The weight of the eggs sinks the palm frond

404
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:36,920
and puts an end to the spawning and to the crew's filming.

405
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,840
Well, it's moments like that we do the job for.

406
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,960
Everything was right.

407
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,200
The light was right, blue water,

408
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:02,000
the four tonnes of flying fish all going mental.

409
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,720
Thanks, Barry.You're welcome.

410
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:08,040
But now the fish's attention is turned to something bigger.

411
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:11,280
Their spawning directly onto the boat.

412
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:15,600
Barry is worried as he drags up a huge sheet of eggs.

413
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:18,240
Gotta bring it on the boat and check it out.

414
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:21,800
I cleaned this off like five minutes a go. Right?

415
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:25,800
Right now the problem is this, there's too many flying fish...

416
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:26,880
Too many...around us.

417
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:29,800
If we moor through the nights with the lights on and stuff,

418
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:34,960
more and more will keep coming and what they're doing is they're actually laying on the boat now,

419
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,840
so the boat has become their object and that is not good.

420
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:41,200
So basically you're worried that if we just stay on this drift

421
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,720
we're gonna sink the boat.

422
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:47,080
Five hours from now that'll 3,000 pounds.Yeah, yeah.

423
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:50,120
In the back here, it will sink the boat.

424
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,840
OK, so we've got to leave this area.

425
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,720
Yeah, we can't stay here.

426
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:57,560
Just five minutes of spawning has produced this.

427
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:01,000
The team have no option but to move on.

428
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:06,950
The next day the search for flying fish begins all over again.

429
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:12,110
This time the team want to film the fish doing what they're famous for.

430
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:14,190
We've got some lovely shots from the spawning

431
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:17,430
but now the really hard bit of trying to get them flying.

432
00:55:17,470 --> 00:55:20,710
Gonna be, gonna be a good challenge.

433
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:25,830
The fish are around, but they're all too far off to film.

434
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:33,190
The action is impressive this morning,

435
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:35,670
unpredictable but impressive but it's distant,

436
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:37,710
it's not happening next to the boat today.

437
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:41,550
They're either being chased off or they're just not interested. Look!

438
00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:45,550
Look, look! Ah it's loads.

439
00:55:45,590 --> 00:55:47,070
Ay, ay, ay!

440
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:52,950
The next day the crew decides to try a different approach.

441
00:55:57,190 --> 00:55:58,670
All right, lets go.

442
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:05,470
Now they're just where they need to be,

443
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:08,430
but it puts them directly in the firing line.

444
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:12,590
I guess that's one!

445
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:23,950
Despite being bombarded, their strategy is paying off.

446
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:28,670
That was amazing, we spent a long time in that wee boat today. Thanks.

447
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:31,590
But the last two hours were just off the scale.

448
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:34,950
We were just getting shot after shot. We need...

449
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:38,990
Can't wait to watch it on the big monitor but it felt really good.

450
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:42,310
And Doug is right,

451
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:45,110
it worked.

452
00:56:44,430 --> 00:56:48,230
Flying fish taking to the air and flying.

453
00:56:48,270 --> 00:56:51,910
Slowed down 40 times.

454
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:16,110
By working with people more used to catching fish than filming them

455
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:20,100
the Life team have been able to gain a unique insight

456
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:22,500
into the hidden world of fish.
