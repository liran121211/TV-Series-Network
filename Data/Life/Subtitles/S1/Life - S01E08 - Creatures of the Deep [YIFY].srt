1
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,200
The ocean. The largest habitat on Earth,

2
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:33,000
and an inhospitable place for those of us who live on land.

3
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:41,000
Yet, for a billion years, this was the only place on the planet

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,800
where life existed.

5
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:55,500
Today, descendants of those early life forms continue to thrive.

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,200
They share the sea with fish, but outnumber them by ten to one.

7
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,400
They have no backbones,

8
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,600
and have evolved into countless different forms.

9
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:21,500
Some are huge, large-brained and intelligent.

10
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,400
Others are minuscule,

11
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,300
yet build the largest natural structures on the planet.

12
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,800
They are marine invertebrates, the creatures of the deep.

13
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,400
They have colonised every corner of the ocean,

14
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,700
and have a mind-boggling range of solutions

15
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,000
to the problem of staying alive.

16
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,100
The ocean is by no means uniform.

17
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:40,500
Differences in depth, temperature, sunlight and currents

18
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,800
pose particular challenges.

19
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,100
One and a half miles down, these hydrothermal vents

20
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:53,900
spew out super-heated water at 450 degrees Centigrade

21
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,900
from cracks in the Earth's crust.

22
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,000
Despite the enormous pressure, the total darkness,

23
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,100
and the scaldingly-high temperatures,

24
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:09,800
the ancestors of all life may have evolved in a place just like this.

25
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,400
Pompeii worms.

26
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,800
So named for their ability to survive volcanic heat.

27
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,100
They share the vents with crabs and two-metre-long tube worms.

28
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,500
They can only survive here because they are able to feed on bacteria

29
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,200
that thrive around the vents.

30
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,100
These colonies are extremely rare.

31
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,800
Not surprisingly, most life thrives

32
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,700
nearer the surface, where feeding is considerably easier.

33
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,600
These are krill, tiny shrimp-like crustaceans.

34
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:17,100
Swarms can reach astounding numbers - 60,000 per cubic metre.

35
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:25,300
During the night they rise towards the surface to feed on plankton.

36
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,400
Here, in the Sea of Cortez, off Mexico,

37
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,600
the swarms attract hunters of all kinds,

38
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,200
from humpback whales to shoals of predatory fish.

39
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,200
Yet another hunter arrives.

40
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,200
It's one from the deep.

41
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,800
A Humboldt squid.

42
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:05,100
Two metres long, they have a local reputation as man-eaters.

43
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,300
Alone, they are formidable enough...

44
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,000
..but this is a pack...

45
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,600
..of hundreds.

46
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,300
They are highly intelligent hunters. Their eyesight is exceptional.

47
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,900
They have powerful tentacles, suckers ringed with 70,000 hooks

48
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,800
and a razor-sharp beak for tearing through flesh.

49
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,800
Now the fish find that they are under attack

50
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,800
and so group together for safety.

51
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,700
But the Humboldt squid work as a team,

52
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,600
herding the fish against the rocks.

53
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,800
It's thought that the squid flash red and white not only to confuse their prey,

54
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,200
but also to signal to each other when they are about to attack.

55
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,400
Humboldt squid numbers are growing rapidly.

56
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,800
But they remain mysterious.

57
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,400
As fast as they arrived, they disappear back into the deep.

58
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:37,400
800 miles from the South Pole, in the shadow of a smouldering Mount Erebus.

59
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:48,500
Winter temperatures are a punishing minus 40.

60
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,200
This, perhaps, is the last place you might expect to find marine life.

61
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,200
Now it's the beginning of the polar spring,

62
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,200
and for the first time in months,

63
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,800
light reaches the sea beneath the ice.

64
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,800
It's extremely cold and completely dark for much of the year,

65
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,400
so conditions are not unlike those of the deep ocean.

66
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:53,600
Yet, in McMurdo Sound, life flourishes.

67
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,500
The creatures here grow extremely slowly.

68
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:20,300
But that does mean they can reach a great age and great size,

69
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:24,600
and they occur in surprisingly large numbers.

70
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,800
Three-metre-long, carnivorous nemertean worms.

71
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,800
Red sea stars

72
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,700
and urchins carpet the sea floor.

73
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,600
This monster-worm will eat almost anything

74
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,200
and is constantly scanning the sea floor for food.

75
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,700
Animals are swarming here in such numbers because of this...

76
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,700
..a dead seal pup.

77
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,700
Such a great quantity of food

78
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,200
may only arrive once in ten years.

79
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,800
But a seal's body won't be easy to eat.

80
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,300
Nemerteans have a snout like a harpoon,

81
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,700
that enables them to puncture the skin of the corpse.

82
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,500
It's harder work for the sea stars.

83
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,200
They feed by pushing out their stomachs through their mouths.

84
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:12,500
As this sea star presses its stomach against the seal's skin,

85
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:17,800
it secretes digestive juices that dissolve the seal's tissue.

86
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,900
But that takes time.

87
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,400
These scavengers will feed here throughout the summer,

88
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:35,900
until all that remains of the seal will be a skeleton, stripped bare.

89
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:47,500
The shallows are only a tiny part of the marine world.

90
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,600
90% of it is open water.

91
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,400
Its currents carry life for thousands of miles.

92
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:07,200
The masters of this nomadic existence are jellyfish.

93
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,800
A life spent drifting in the empty ocean could be a lonely one...

94
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,100
but not for this jellyfish.

95
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,900
Aurelia.

96
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,200
Swarms like this are not accidental.

97
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,400
These individuals all hatched together

98
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,000
when the temperature and currents were just right.

99
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,900
Their timing has ensured that they can make the most

100
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,800
of feeding on a late-summer plankton bloom.

101
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,900
Jellyfish have no brain and no blood.

102
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:16,100
But they do have eyespots that enable them to tell the difference between light and dark.

103
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,600
And they can move independently of the current

104
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,600
by a simple form of jet propulsion.

105
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,700
All jellyfish have stinging tentacles with which to catch their food.

106
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,600
As they pulse their bodies, the tentacles trap plankton,

107
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,300
which is then passed towards their mouth in the centre.

108
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,600
A swarm of 100,000 stinging jellyfish

109
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,000
might seem a daunting prospect for a predator...

110
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,200
..but not for this one.

111
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,500
A huge fried egg jellyfish.

112
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,000
It is a killer.

113
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,200
Its weapons are harpoon-like cells that cover its tentacles.

114
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,200
When they come into contact with a victim, they spear it.

115
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,200
The fried egg then hauls in its prey.

116
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:08,600
A few lucky Aurelia do manage to pull themselves free.

117
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:18,200
But for the majority, there is only one outcome...

118
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,000
Death.

119
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,700
Jellyfish, like a great many marine invertebrates,

120
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,500
have soft, vulnerable bodies.

121
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,400
They are protected by stinging cells.

122
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,900
But there are other kinds of defence.

123
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,900
Armour plating.

124
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,700
These are spider crabs.

125
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:25,600
They spend most of their lives in deep water.

126
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,400
But once a year, off the coast of Southern Australia,

127
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:35,300
a quarter of a million crabs set off on a long journey to the shallows.

128
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,400
They are here because they all share a problem.

129
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:50,600
Each crab has been wearing the same suit of armour for a year now.

130
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:58,700
And it's getting uncomfortably tight.

131
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:09,600
So each crab eventually has to shed its shell and produce a bigger one.

132
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:15,800
Replacing an old shell is understandably a tricky process.

133
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:23,600
First the crab grows an entirely new skin within the old shell.

134
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:32,100
It then flexes its body to force its shell to split along the back...

135
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,000
..before gingerly backing itself out.

136
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:52,200
The spider crabs are not only here to moult, but to mate.

137
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,700
And they grab the opportunity with considerable enthusiasm.

138
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,700
Coming together in such numbers does however have a drawback.

139
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,400
It attracts predators.

140
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,000
A stingray.

141
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,400
Despite there being so many potential prey,

142
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,300
the stingray seems to ignore them.

143
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,500
Perhaps there's safety in numbers...

144
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,100
..although not all the crabs

145
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,000
are prepared to rely on it.

146
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,800
Alarm spreads amongst the crabs.

147
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:16,000
But in fact, most of them are safe. This ray is being very choosy.

148
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,800
It's only interested in the softest shelled,

149
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,100
most recently moulted crabs.

150
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,300
Once a target is singled out, there is no escape.

151
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,200
When their new armour has hardened,

152
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,000
the crabs return to the comparative safety of the deep,

153
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,600
leaving behind only their old, empty shells.

154
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:29,800
Like spider crabs, the behaviour of most marine creatures is controlled by a very simple nervous system.

155
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,300
But there are exceptions.

156
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:43,200
This cuttlefish is one of the cleverest animals in the ocean.

157
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,600
She has a very large brain.

158
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:51,100
In fact, it's larger for her size than that of most fish or reptiles.

159
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,600
Her life is both complex and full of intrigue.

160
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,000
Giant Australian cuttlefish usually live alone,

161
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
but once in their short lives they must come together to mate.

162
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,700
As she approaches the traditional mating grounds,

163
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:26,000
one of the largest males starts to show interest in her.

164
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,400
She moves him away from his rivals to a quieter spot -

165
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,800
a place where she will be able to lay her eggs in safety.

166
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,200
The male takes the female in his arms and turns her to face him,

167
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,100
before using one of his arms to pass sacks of sperm

168
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,400
to an opening near her mouth.

169
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,600
Once mated, he hovers over her,

170
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,000
standing guard until she's laid her eggs.

171
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,500
But he's got a problem.

172
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,500
Males outnumber females four to one.

173
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:02,100
So keeping her to himself is a constant battle.

174
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:29,400
This larger rival is more difficult to intimidate.

175
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,000
Cuttlefish can make very dramatic changes to their skin pattern

176
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,400
in order to signal their moods.

177
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:47,200
Flushes of bright colour and stripes that pulse along his side,

178
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,700
tell the rival to keep off.

179
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:05,100
Most rivals back down at this stage, but not this one.

180
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:11,200
Although the male's flashing signals get more and more emphatic,

181
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,600
in the end, he has no choice but to fight.

182
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:56,300
Victory! And the male can return to guard his female.

183
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:04,400
Cuttlefish are great communicators, but there is a flip side -

184
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,400
they can also be masters of deception.

185
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:22,400
This male is too small to fight for a mate, but he has another plan -

186
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,400
and it's sneaky.

187
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,800
He approaches the couple cautiously,

188
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,300
holding his tentacles tucked up at the front,

189
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,200
mimicking a female that wants to mate.

190
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,900
To complete his disguise,

191
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:41,400
he changes colour to appear even more like a female.

192
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:47,600
The guarding male seems convinced, maybe he thinks his luck is in -

193
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,400
another female to add to his conquests.

194
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,000
The sly, cross-dressing male

195
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,800
edges closer and closer to the female, holding his nerve.

196
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:20,500
As long as he avoids being grabbed in a mating embrace, the sneak is safe.

197
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:34,500
At what point the female guesses his true identity is unclear,

198
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:38,600
but she isn't choosy, and surreptitiously mates with him

199
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,300
right under the larger male's tentacles.

200
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,600
It's time for the female to lay her eggs.

201
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:15,800
Using the sperm from both males, she fertilises her eggs one by one

202
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,600
and glues them to a rock in a hidden crevice.

203
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,400
With luck, she will now have a mix of offspring.

204
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:30,200
Some may become masterful males, and others, little sneaks.

205
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,300
She'll have all the bases covered.

206
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,600
The coastal waters of British Columbia.

207
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:52,100
Home to this four-metre-long Pacific Giant Octopus.

208
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:04,800
She is a formidable predator, but at the moment hunting isn't on her mind.

209
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,700
She has just mated for the first time.

210
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:20,200
And now she's searching for a safe refuge.

211
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,300
She makes her choice carefully.

212
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:40,900
This is going to be her home for many months to come.

213
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,400
It's her nursery den.

214
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,400
100,000 eggs hang from its ceiling,

215
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,300
and she's guarding them with her life.

216
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,900
Without her to protect them, they would be eaten by predators,

217
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,900
or become diseased.

218
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,800
She caresses them with her tentacles,

219
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:25,000
ensuring that algae don't grow on them, and that fish don't eat them.

220
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,200
She constantly keeps the water moving around them,

221
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,900
so they're well-supplied with oxygen.

222
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,400
She cares for them for six months,

223
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,400
and during all this time, she doesn't eat a thing.

224
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,600
And now, as they are hatching,

225
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,900
she is dying.

226
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,600
One night, as the baby octopus emerge,

227
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:23,200
she jets water over them for the last time, helping them on their way.

228
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,700
This will be her final act.

229
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,200
This is the only time she will reproduce,

230
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:48,000
and to give her young their best chance, she sacrifices her life.

231
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:02,800
Out of the depths comes one of the largest and most aggressive starfish in the ocean.

232
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,500
Pycnopodia,

233
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:09,300
a giant sunstar the size of a dustbin lid.

234
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:20,700
It's a hunter. Each arm is covered by super-sensitive tube feet,

235
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,500
that can detect prey by touch and smell.

236
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,000
But the sunstar is also partial to carrion,

237
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,600
and it detects the carcass of the giant octopus mother.

238
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,600
The miniature suckers on its feet clamp on to the corpse,

239
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,100
and drag it out of the cave.

240
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,200
Other scavengers rush to join the feast.

241
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,300
Although it's a fearsome predator,

242
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:27,000
Pycnopodia doesn't have it all its own way.

243
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,500
These sea urchins aren't speedy enough to escape,

244
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,300
but they do have a formidable defence.

245
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:38,600
The sharp spines are hard to get past,

246
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:43,700
and, what's more, the urchins can move each spine independently,

247
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,400
pinching the starfish's probing arms.

248
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,200
Trapped by an army of urchins,

249
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:05,200
Pycnopodia is spotted by an enormous king crab.

250
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,800
Pycnopodia has more than met its match,

251
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:18,400
and within seconds, the crab rips off one of its arms.

252
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,800
But that is just a temporary inconvenience.

253
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:37,000
Starfish are able to quickly regrow a lost limb.

254
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,100
The most impressive invertebrates may seem to be the giants,

255
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:51,200
but in fact it's some of the smallest that can make the biggest impact.

256
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,400
Every square inch of this island has been created

257
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,200
by an ever-growing, living superstructure,

258
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,900
a coral reef.

259
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,800
It's taken thousands of years to reach this size,

260
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:11,200
and it all began with creatures smaller than a pinhead.

261
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,800
A reef can't be built just anywhere,

262
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,600
it needs something to give it a firm footing.

263
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,600
A wreck like this provides an excellent foundation.

264
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,800
As soon as it settles on the sea bed,

265
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,600
the wreck comes under attack from invaders -

266
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,400
plankton, carried here by ocean currents.

267
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:18,100
These are the microscopic larvae of barnacles, sponges,

268
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:21,200
and, most importantly, corals.

269
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,400
The larvae must attach themselves to the wreck.

270
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,900
Once there, they can develop into young corals called polyps.

271
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,600
But the polyps are very slow-growing,

272
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:48,600
and there is lots of competition from other invaders.

273
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,400
Algae quickly cover the wreck,

274
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,200
and that's a problem for the young coral.

275
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,800
Algae attract grazers.

276
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:30,000
The polyps are in danger of being eaten before they've even got a proper foothold.

277
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,000
If conditions are right,

278
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,400
the survivors can go on to build a reef.

279
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,900
Position is critical.

280
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,600
Too deep, and not enough light will reach the corals for them to grow.

281
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:54,300
Too shallow, and they risk being exposed to the air at low tide.

282
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,100
For the reef to really flourish,

283
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:02,400
it also needs to be in the path of currents carrying food.

284
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,000
Fast-forward half a dozen years or so,

285
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,400
and the wreck will begin to show the first signs

286
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,800
of corals visible to the naked eye.

287
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,700
A decade later, and the wreck will be transformed.

288
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:43,000
Thousands of polyps will form coral heads that encrust its surface.

289
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:51,000
This ship was sunk during the Second World War,

290
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,800
and there has been enough time for a substantial reef to develop.

291
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,100
After decades of growth,

292
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:06,300
different species of corals dominate particular areas of the wreck.

293
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:18,000
The fastest-growing types grow best on the edges and overhangs,

294
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
reaching far out into the water, and up to the light.

295
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,600
They need only a small area to establish themselves,

296
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,800
yet they can rapidly grow dozens of plates, or branches,

297
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,100
crammed with polyps, to gather as much light as possible.

298
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:57,100
Slower-growing, much more robust corals like these brain corals,

299
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:00,300
are better suited to the heart of the developing reef.

300
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:07,600
It's these that give the reef their structure and permanence.

301
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
There could be nearly 500 different species here,

302
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
each striving to win a foothold on the rusting hulk.

303
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,000
The pace of life for corals may seem to be so slow,

304
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,300
that it's hard to imagine that there is any conflict here.

305
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,800
But, as night falls, the mood on the reef changes.

306
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,900
Corals are, in fact, extremely aggressive,

307
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:48,200
and will fight to the death to expand their territory.

308
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,800
There can be no honourable retreat,

309
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:56,200
a winner will, literally, eat its enemy alive.

310
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:04,300
Along the battle front, the polyps of both combatants extrude their guts,

311
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:07,800
long thread-like filaments, over their opponents.

312
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:14,000
At the fringe, all that remains of the destroyed polyps

313
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,800
are their skeletons.

314
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:21,900
The coral that can digest fastest, wins.

315
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:31,600
Corals constantly grow over the skeletons of their dead comrades,

316
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,800
building a bigger and bigger reef.

317
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,500
Then, just once a year,

318
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:42,800
a few days after the November full moon, the corals take part

319
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,000
in a mass spawning event.

320
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,500
Millions of eggs and sperm are released into the water,

321
00:40:54,500 --> 00:41:00,200
and join, to develop into larvae that drift in search of a place to settle.

322
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:43,400
Eventually, every inch of the wreck's surface will be colonised.

323
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:47,600
The steel will rust away, and the reef will be on its own.

324
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:02,000
Most reefs grow without the help of a wreck to start them off.

325
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,800
But, given time, they can create something as huge as this,

326
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,800
the Great Barrier Reef, the largest living structure on Earth.

327
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:33,300
A coral reef rivals even a rainforest for its diversity of life.

328
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:37,800
Yet corals like this are found in waters where food is very scarce.

329
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,400
All the creatures here have had to adopt a different

330
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:50,100
and highly specialised way to gather every nourishing scrap.

331
00:42:54,600 --> 00:43:00,100
Christmas tree worms bore into the coral's skeleton for protection,

332
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:04,200
swirling out and grabbing food particles with their feathery gills.

333
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,700
Coral barnacles are, in fact, related to lobsters.

334
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,000
They lie on their backs,

335
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,000
waving their feet to gather any food floating past.

336
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,600
Crabs have evolved many different ways of gathering food.

337
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:34,000
This porcelain crab has a fan of filaments on his front legs.

338
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:42,600
A boxer crab attaches a tiny sea anemone to each fist.

339
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:46,300
As well as for defence, he uses their sticky tentacles

340
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,500
to gather passing plankton.

341
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:56,900
This orangutan crab's whole body is coated with sticky hairs,

342
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,900
in this case, perhaps just a bit too sticky!

343
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:29,400
This strange creature is a sea cucumber.

344
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:33,500
It uses its tentacles to grab food from the sediment.

345
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,200
There are hunters here too,

346
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,400
like these nudibranchs, or sea slugs.

347
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,600
Their vibrant colours are a warning that they're toxic.

348
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:50,400
There are over 3,000 species, many hunt just one specific prey.

349
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,100
Some hunt each other.

350
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:03,200
This emperor shrimp makes the most of the poisonous nature of its host.

351
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,500
But, it's a rather one-sided affair.

352
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:10,400
As it feeds, the shrimp gets protection and a free ride.

353
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:20,700
Other shrimps have developed a more balanced relationship.

354
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:23,500
Some even solicit for partners.

355
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,100
These dance for their dinner.

356
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,400
And these advertise to passers-by

357
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,500
that they are open for business.

358
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:48,600
They are a parasite removal team,

359
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:51,400
providing a service for countless fish on the reef,

360
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:55,400
including those that could happily eat them.

361
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,400
In return for their bravery, they get a meal that comes to them.

362
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:31,000
Coral reefs, built by the tiniest of creatures,

363
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,300
occupy less than half of one per cent of the ocean's floor.

364
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:42,100
Yet they support a quarter of all marine species.

365
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,800
Marine creatures, all without backbones,

366
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,700
from corals, to cuttlefish, to crabs,

367
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:27,100
make up the majority of life in the oceans.

368
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:31,000
But they have also had a surprisingly important impact

369
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,600
beyond the marine world.

370
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,800
Their fossilised bodies, shells and skeletons

371
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:41,800
form the limestone and chalk that now covers huge tracts

372
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,900
of Asia, Europe, and the Americas.

373
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:49,600
They may be small, but over their two billion-year history,

374
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:54,200
they have, literally, changed the world.

375
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,200
To capture some of the sequences in this episode,

376
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:10,700
the Life team had to take underwater filming into uncharted territory.

377
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,300
One shoot meant spending weeks diving under two metres of ice,

378
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:20,300
another involved laying the foundation for a new coral reef

379
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:21,400
in the tropics.

380
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:32,500
A sunken ship can make an ideal location for corals to grow.

381
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,700
So, with this in mind,

382
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:37,000
the Life team set themselves a challenge...

383
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,300
to make their very own shipwreck.

384
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,600
After months of searching,

385
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:47,400
they find a boat in the Bahamas that might be suitable.

386
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:50,800
But there's a lot to do before it can be sunk to the sea bed.

387
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,400
Apparently it's been here for eight years on the jetty.

388
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:58,400
All this fibreglass insulation has all got to be removed

389
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,400
and it's all hands to the pump, Ian.

390
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,400
We've got to get a pair of overalls.

391
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:07,000
The team have to put away their cameras and get their hands dirty.

392
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,300
I've got a 50-tonne boat,

393
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,800
and I'm trying to clean it with a paint scraper!

394
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,900
Thoroughly cleaning the boat

395
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:16,300
increases the chance that coral will grow on it,

396
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:18,200
and ensures it won't pollute the sea.

397
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:21,200
It's like Changing Rooms, isn't it?

398
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,700
After eight years rusting on the jetty,

399
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:26,400
there's no guarantee that she'll even float.

400
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,200
Well, we actually... we do have some holes.

401
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,200
All up!

402
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:36,600
To get this ship ready in time for the inspectors is a massive task,

403
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:39,100
and they've been doing a brilliant job.

404
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:42,200
We're cutting panels through to let the water rush through

405
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,000
when she starts sinking.

406
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:50,200
That's the last bit, OK, guys. Vamos!

407
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:53,300
Shipshape at last.

408
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:57,800
Well, she's clean, she's been inspected, and she's ready to be sunk.

409
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:00,800
What can go wrong now?

410
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,100
- TELEVISION:
- 'Here's the very latest with Dean...'

411
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:07,300
As the tail end of Hurricane Dean sweeps through,

412
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:10,200
the team are forced to put their plans on hold.

413
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:13,100
- TELEVISION:
- '..winds of 150 miles an hour...'

414
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:17,200
Luck doesn't seem to be on their side.

415
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:27,000
But, two days later, good weather returns.

416
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,800
Here comes a crane, finally!

417
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,100
Fingers crossed, arms crossed, legs crossed, everything's crossed!

418
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:39,600
They urgently need to get the boat into the water,

419
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:43,700
or they won't reach the chosen wreck site before nightfall.

420
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:48,600
She's safely in the water, so far, so good.

421
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,700
It floats!

422
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,600
Her final voyage...

423
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:58,600
Cameras are mounted around the deck,

424
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:01,400
to film her sinking below the surface.

425
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:06,000
We've spent a week preparing for this, and finally the afternoon's arrived.

426
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,200
But the light's going, so we have to move.

427
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:15,400
A last few holes are cut. It's time to pump in water,

428
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,800
and to abandon ship.

429
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,200
The crew dive in,

430
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:28,600
ready to film her descent, while the support boat moves away to a safe distance.

431
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:31,600
There's nothing more to do, but wait.

432
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,300
Here we go, look at this!

433
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:08,000
She gently comes to rest, and the right way up, just as they'd hoped.

434
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,600
Now, it's time to let nature take its course.

435
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:25,900
The crew will be back over the next two years to see how life takes hold.

436
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:30,000
At this site, the wreck has a very good chance

437
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,200
that it'll be colonised by coral.

438
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:37,000
With luck and time, it'll eventually become a full-scale reef.

439
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:42,500
Meanwhile, at the other end of the world,

440
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:45,800
the Life team's challenge is very different.

441
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:53,800
Here in Antarctica, just getting underwater will be tough.

442
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,900
In order to work in such a demanding location,

443
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:04,100
the team needed the help of the National Science Foundation,

444
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:07,400
at the McMurdo polar research station.

445
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Everyone here has to be able to cope out on the ice

446
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,500
if there's an emergency.

447
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:22,300
So the Life team joins research scientists for survival training,

448
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:25,000
to prepare them for any situation.

449
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,500
Even one like this.

450
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:41,300
A colleague lost in a whiteout is very serious.

451
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:45,900
This training might mean the difference between rescue, or not.

452
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:49,300
This is supposed to simulate a whiteout,

453
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:52,300
we've been looking for someone who's been lost, and you wear

454
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:56,900
the bucket so you cannot see at all, and it does actually work.

455
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:00,100
It's just... You can't see anything in this.

456
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:07,400
With the training over, it's time to travel over the ice to the dive site,

457
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:11,400
ready to go beneath the frozen surface of the Ross Sea.

458
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:18,400
But to get through this ice, thick enough to land a jet on,

459
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,900
needs the help of McMurdo's specialist drilling team.

460
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:48,900
Once the hole is drilled,

461
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:52,900
a specially designed hut is slid into position.

462
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:01,400
This will be the team's base for the next four weeks of diving.

463
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,300
Look, this is all we need, all we need to go in here...

464
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:10,600
the door to another world.

465
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:13,100
All the equipment the team need for the shots

466
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:15,100
must come in and out of this hole.

467
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:18,100
This is as far south as it's possible to dive.

468
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:23,800
The ice, eight feet thick, it's here for 11½ months of the year,

469
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:26,500
and we're goin go down underneath and have a look,

470
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:29,200
to see just what it's like underneath there.

471
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,600
Doug and the team venture below the ice.

472
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:08,200
The under-ice landscape is both surprising and spectacular,

473
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:11,200
but it's the animals they've come to film.

474
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:19,200
So, specialist time-lapse cameras are moved into position.

475
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,900
The animals move very slowly at these freezing temperatures.

476
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:34,400
But by using time-lapse to speed up the action 500 times,

477
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:40,900
the team hopes to reveal the behaviour of these creatures for the first time.

478
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:55,300
With air and warmth running out for this dive,

479
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:58,200
Doug makes his way back to the lifeline,

480
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,600
and the surface.

481
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:25,500
Oh! That is amazing. It is so beautiful down there.

482
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:30,100
All sorts of colours, beautiful stalactites made of ice crystals

483
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:32,500
hanging down from the top of the ice.

484
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:35,700
All sorts of things on the bottom, starfish, urchins,

485
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:37,600
just an amazing profusion of life.

486
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:41,000
Really lovely, totally unique, unlike anywhere else.

487
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,100
However, after an hour underwater it is getting pretty cold,

488
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:48,400
so can you give me a hand up, please? Thanks.

489
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:55,000
There would be another month here, and over 100 dives,

490
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,200
before the sequence was eventually completed.
