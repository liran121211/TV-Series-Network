1
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,120
One 150 million years ago,

2
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,720
as dinosaurs approached their golden age,

3
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,200
one group evolved along new and revolutionary lines.

4
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,720
Although they retained many of their reptilian characteristics,

5
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,680
they acquired extraordinary new ones...

6
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,440
..feathers.

7
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,680
Feathers helped with insulation

8
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,320
and display.

9
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,800
But they offered something far more valuable.

10
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,240
The power of flight.

11
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,680
And for birds, that changed everything.

12
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:49,200
Birds have the freedom of the skies, to travel further and faster than any other group of animals

13
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,040
and to seize opportunities in all corners of the planet.

14
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,560
But this freedom brings many survival challenges,

15
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,440
which birds must tackle at pivotal moments in their lives.

16
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,080
Flying demands enormous skill and effort,

17
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,000
and nowhere is that more evident than here, in the foothills of the Peruvian Andes.

18
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:49,920
This female hummingbird hovers with precision in her quest for nectar.

19
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,240
Her wing and tail design allow her to fly in any direction.

20
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,320
But the male has a real problem flying.

21
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,040
And this is why

22
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:18,480
he's weighed down with two super-long tail feathers, tipped with cumbersome discs.

23
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,920
This is the marvellous spatuletail hummingbird.

24
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,640
and these are his flags with which to seduce a mate.

25
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,120
Waving them back and forth takes a lot of effort,

26
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,440
even from the comfort of his perch,

27
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,320
but to win her heart he's got to go up a gear.

28
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,760
He must show her how well he can fly but it's exhausting work.

29
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,120
It's so demanding he can only stay airborne for a matter of seconds

30
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,000
before he needs a rest.

31
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,920
He's struggling to impress her, so one last try.

32
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:55,680
The extreme effort and energy needed to hover means hummingbirds can only fly in short, sharp bursts.

33
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,240
But most birds need to stay airborne for considerably longer,

34
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,360
and must find far more energy-efficient ways to get around.

35
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,320
Here in the Simien mountains of Ethiopia,

36
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,520
at a breathtaking altitude of 15,000 feet,

37
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,120
lives a supreme aerial maestro.

38
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,640
The lammergeier.

39
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:47,000
This youngster glides on air currents rising from the mountain slopes below.

40
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,360
His nine-foot wingspan can carry him hundreds of miles a day

41
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,320
in search of animal carcasses, with precious little effort.

42
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:09,120
He watches out for other airborne scavengers, like these griffon vultures.

43
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:19,440
They lead him to some commotion on the cliffs, and maybe the chance to feed.

44
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,120
But this youngster is not the only lammergeier to spot the opportunity.

45
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,160
So too has this adult.

46
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,360
The vultures quickly strip the carcass clean.

47
00:06:54,920 --> 00:07:00,880
It seems he's too late. But in fact he's timed his arrival perfectly.

48
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,600
There's no meat left

49
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:26,480
and that's exactly the moment that the lammergeier has been waiting for.

50
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,800
It's bones he's after.

51
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,800
The young lammergeier too homes in on the carcass.

52
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,520
Bones contain rich marrow fat,

53
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,880
but extracting it is not easy,

54
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:10,400
especially when the bone is a solid four kilos and too big to swallow.

55
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,720
But lammergeiers have an extraordinary solution, thanks to their flying skills.

56
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,520
Soaring up on thermal air currents and positioning the bone parallel

57
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,160
to his body to minimize drag, he soon reaches the perfect height.

58
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,720
From here he glides to a place he knows

59
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,320
where he can deal with the bone,

60
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,600
where there are giant rock slabs sit on the lip of an escarpment.

61
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,040
The bone is smashed.

62
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,360
The juices in his stomach are more corrosive than battery acid.

63
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,680
They dissolve the bone so that he can now digest the marrow.

64
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:41,280
Others come looking for leftovers.

65
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,480
But their timing isn't ideal

66
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,320
because now the young lammergeier has his turn!

67
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,760
They'd better mind their heads!

68
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,800
Proficient bone smashing takes endless practice

69
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,280
to find just the right height, speed and moment of release.

70
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,240
Lammergeiers have long, broad wings,

71
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:54,280
ideal for gliding great distances with maximum efficiency.

72
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,240
But on the island of Little Tobago in the Caribbean

73
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,800
lives a bird for whom aerial agility is of paramount importance.

74
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,400
The red-billed tropicbird.

75
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:21,320
Short, pointed wings give it great manoeuvrability and speed.

76
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:32,320
During the breeding season, these flying skills are tested to the limit.

77
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,960
While one parent looks after the chick, the other must journey

78
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:50,000
far offshore, to gather small fish and squid from the surface waters.

79
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:09,560
But the hardest part is getting food back to the island, because they share this airspace with thieves.

80
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,320
Magnificent frigatebirds,

81
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,280
known as Man O' War birds, patrol high above.

82
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,480
These pirates are not trying to kill the tropicbird,

83
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,520
but force it to give up its catch.

84
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,960
It's an aerial dogfight.

85
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,520
Tropicbirds are quicker on the turn.

86
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,920
Frigates have exceptionally lightweight bodies

87
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,120
and their extremely long wings give them great power.

88
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,080
Success.

89
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,080
A favourite attack is from behind, and at height.

90
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,640
There goes the fish -

91
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,320
another victory.

92
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,240
This tropicbird chick still awaits the return of its parent

93
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,360
who has yet to run the gauntlet of the pirates.

94
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,080
Keeping close to the waves is his best chance.

95
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,960
Frigatebirds have so little oil in their feathers

96
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,520
they can't risk ditching.

97
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,720
If he can just reach the cliffs he'll be safe.

98
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:19,240
He's made it, with his crop still full of fish.

99
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:57,840
Red-billed tropicbirds rely on extreme aerial agility to overcome the many challenges of their life.

100
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:05,040
For others, survival demands endurance.

101
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,680
Every spring, red knots

102
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:17,360
fly 10,000 miles from their wintering grounds in Argentina to their nesting sites in Canada.

103
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,680
The only way they complete this marathon journey

104
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:28,600
is by making a crucial fuel stop here in Delaware Bay, on the east coast of America.

105
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:36,000
What is most extraordinary is that as well as having to find their way

106
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,120
to this one location, they must also time their arrival to perfection.

107
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:53,880
They have a rendezvous with prehistoric creatures emerging from the deep

108
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,760
which have hardly changed in 250 million years.

109
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:12,480
They come ashore in greatest numbers on the highest spring tides.

110
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,360
Horseshoe crabs.

111
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,360
The crabs are here to lay their eggs.

112
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,920
That's what the knots are after.

113
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,640
Most eggs are buried out of reach,

114
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,480
but some are accidentally dug up by other crabs.

115
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:37,960
Most of the west Atlantic red knot population join this feeding frenzy.

116
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:53,600
In a matter of weeks the knots need to rebuild their fat reserves

117
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,760
and double in weight.

118
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,240
To achieve this, each knot must eat as many as 400,000 eggs -

119
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,440
a tall order given the skill and effort needed to swallow just one.

120
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:26,320
Head down, feeding non-stop means it's hard to be alert to predators.

121
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,560
A peregrine falcon.

122
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,960
With egg laying complete, the horseshoe crabs now leave

123
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,760
these shores while the knots gather every last egg they can find.

124
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,840
It's time for the birds to move on.

125
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:55,280
The knots still have a further 2,000-mile non-stop flight

126
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,840
to reach their breeding grounds in Canada.

127
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:11,600
Flight gives birds many advantages, but there's a period in their lives

128
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,400
when they are forced back down to Earth.

129
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,320
The nesting season.

130
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:25,120
This is the time when they are at most risk,

131
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,640
so they must find the safest possible location.

132
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:39,050
Few go to greater extremes than lesser flamingos.

133
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:45,440
They nest in the remotest corners of Africa's caustic soda lakes.

134
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:51,160
Like their reptilian ancestors, birds lay waterproof eggs.

135
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,600
Despite this, flamingos still protect theirs

136
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:58,850
on special mud-stack nests as the lake is prone to flooding.

137
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,920
It's also just a little cooler up here.

138
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:12,200
Temperatures at ground level can reach a blistering 50 degrees Centigrade.

139
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:25,450
Once a chick hatches, it spends the first six days in the nest.

140
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:28,530
This is when it's at its most vulnerable -

141
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,000
totally reliant on its parents.

142
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:49,730
The caustic mud deters predators.

143
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:58,970
But the adult flamingos can cope in this quagmire, because of their long, scaly legs.

144
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:05,530
Any chick that slips from the nest, however,

145
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:08,650
is treading on very dangerous ground.

146
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:27,210
This parent encourages her chick to climb back to safety.

147
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:15,290
Raising chicks requires huge parental investment in both time and labour,

148
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:17,450
wherever you are.

149
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:24,650
Few places are tougher than the Antarctic.

150
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:33,330
Chinstrap penguins.

151
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:38,090
Every day they travel up to 50 miles out at sea, hunting for krill.

152
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:44,850
But the hard part is getting this food back to the colony,

153
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:52,530
because it sits on the ice-free rim at the top of this giant volcano, Deception Island.

154
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:09,530
For the returning fishing party, the first challenge is getting ashore.

155
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:19,210
The beach is steep, with a powerful undertow.

156
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:43,290
This female lands safely, but she now begins a long journey on foot.

157
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:05,410
For a flightless bird, getting to the top of the volcano

158
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:09,130
means a gruelling climb, especially when glaciers,

159
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:13,290
covered with muddy volcanic ash, stand in your way.

160
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:44,170
It's like a game of snakes and ladders.

161
00:26:55,570 --> 00:27:01,370
A combination of beak, wing tip and feet.

162
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,170
And she wins through!

163
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:16,770
Now she joins penguin rush hour.

164
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,690
Almost home.

165
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:52,250
She's reached the crater rim, but her trials are still not over.

166
00:27:56,650 --> 00:28:03,490
She must now try and find her family among more than a 150,000 birds.

167
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:16,250
Her hearing is so acute she can identify the individual cry of her own chick in the din.

168
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:38,250
She's made it and the family welcomes her return.

169
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:58,090
The result of all this parental effort - a mouthful of krill.

170
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:11,290
Now it's her partner's turn.

171
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:13,730
A chick's demands are endless.

172
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:24,570
Sometimes they can push parents to desperate lengths.

173
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:30,410
But birds are masters of improvisation.

174
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:41,050
Dassen Island, off the coast of South Africa, is home to a nesting colony of great white pelicans.

175
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:52,330
There are chicks of all ages all with a hefty appetite.

176
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:59,810
The parents have a formidable task.

177
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:13,130
These pelicans are among the heaviest flying birds in the world, weighing up to 10 kilos.

178
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:24,690
A V-formation is the most energy efficient means of flying.

179
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:28,530
It significantly reduces drag for the bird behind.

180
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:35,610
Pelicans normally fish along the coast,

181
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:40,370
but a shortage of food supplies has forced them to look elsewhere.

182
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:54,490
Cape gannets

183
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:58,570
plunge deep, hunting fish beyond the reach of the pelicans.

184
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:06,850
But the pelicans aren't after fish.

185
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:10,450
Their sights are set on a bigger catch.

186
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:36,570
Malgas Island is the nesting ground for some 60,000 Cape gannets.

187
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:53,290
Normally one gannet parent goes off fishing while the other looks after the chick.

188
00:31:53,290 --> 00:32:00,330
But declining fish stocks means both parents are often away hunting at the same time,

189
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:03,170
leaving their chicks unguarded,

190
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:12,970
something which hasn't gone unnoticed by the pelicans.

191
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:53,330
Only chicks with parents at their side,

192
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:56,490
or those too large to swallow, have a chance.

193
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:49,810
Back at the pelican colony,

194
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:54,530
the parents regurgitate partially-digested gannet chicks

195
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:55,850
for their brood.

196
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:06,170
Although most seabird colonies on the African Cape are in decline,

197
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:11,010
the population of white pelicans nesting on Dassen is growing.

198
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:33,530
When birds come together to breed,

199
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:36,290
and before they commit to one another,

200
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:40,370
they will often perform the most remarkable displays.

201
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:47,290
One of the most enchanting happens here, on the lakes of Oregon.

202
00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:04,690
Clarke's grebes mate for life, but the female must test her partner's continuing commitment,

203
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:09,250
and she does this by inviting him to join her in a ritualised dance.

204
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:50,650
To strengthen their bond, he offers her a gift.

205
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:20,930
Now, with eyes only for one another,

206
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:25,210
the faithful pair reach the climax of their dance.

207
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:26,530
Other birds don't form pairs.

208
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:31,850
Instead a male tries to mate with as many females as he can.

209
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:38,050
Male sage grouse gather in the grasslands of Wyoming

210
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:40,370
to advertise their virility

211
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:44,170
with a finery of feathers and proud posturing.

212
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:56,890
Females are much drabber-looking,

213
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:59,490
but extremely choosy.

214
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:11,570
They will only mate with the most impressive male,

215
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:16,370
and they judge a male's worthiness by the sounds he makes.

216
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:51,450
Birds go to great lengths to impress their partners.

217
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:56,810
In the forests of New Guinea,

218
00:38:56,810 --> 00:39:01,970
they famously use colourful feathers and song to maximum effect.

219
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:22,530
Birds of Paradise.

220
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:50,050
But in the western part of the island, these flamboyant birds

221
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:54,050
share the forests with a rather unassuming-looking character...

222
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:57,050
the Vogelkop bowerbird.

223
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:08,170
He might lack the plumage, but he's got an extraordinary repertoire of song.

224
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:10,850
And, he's a wonderful mimic.

225
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:16,090
Those are pigeon wing beats.

226
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:21,290
That's a modest tiger-parrot.

227
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:27,210
And that, a sulphur-crested cockatoo.

228
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:35,970
Even more surprising he's an avid collector,

229
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:39,450
with a very appreciative eye for colour.

230
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:47,530
This male favours red and orange flowers.

231
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:54,370
And he's very fond of fungus.

232
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:06,490
Not everything he collects stays where it should.

233
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:18,770
He puts these treasures on display within and around a construction that has taken him years to build.

234
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:35,810
A giant bower woven around a central sapling, carpeted with moss.

235
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:44,450
This grand design is no nest...

236
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:47,850
it's the ultimate seduction parlour.

237
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:01,450
But he's not alone on this hillside.

238
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:05,090
He's got six rivals within earshot.

239
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:13,290
This one prefers darker colours, decorating his bower with deer dung.

240
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:20,650
And charcoal.

241
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:27,370
Visual effect is of crucial importance.

242
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:31,610
Clearly he hadn't planned on all this sprouting fungus.

243
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:53,330
He and his nearest rival live a stone's throw apart.

244
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:57,250
Competition is intense.

245
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:06,730
It's the dung-ball bower that is the first to catch the female's attention.

246
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:12,690
He withdraws, while she inspects his workmanship.

247
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:29,490
She's back again, and seems impressed.

248
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:38,610
But on closer inspection she is less convinced.

249
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:46,010
Perhaps it was that sprouting fungus!

250
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:54,570
Back at the flower bower, the male performs a dress rehearsal.

251
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:03,770
He senses she's watching.

252
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:09,290
This is the moment he's been working towards.

253
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:27,730
His bower channels his song in her direction.

254
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:39,300
A final check.

255
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:52,050
All is to her liking.

256
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:26,090
Few birds devote such craft, effort and ingenuity to achieve this life-defining moment.

257
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:39,650
But here on Kenya's Lake Bogoria, these massive pink slicks

258
00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:45,370
signal the start of perhaps the grandest courtship event in nature.

259
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:51,100
In certain years, when the lake is at its richest,

260
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:55,700
more than a million lesser flamingos congregate to feed.

261
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:07,570
It's now, when they're in their prime, that they must find their preferred partner.

262
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:15,580
To do that they perform a remarkable promenade.

263
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:26,900
With heads held high and neck feathers ruffled,

264
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:30,020
making them look as pink as possible,

265
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:34,100
more and more birds join in the courtship march

266
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:36,260
and pairs begin to bond.

267
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:55,020
Small groups merge with larger ones

268
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:59,460
until almost 1,000 flamingos are on the move.

269
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,180
From the equator to the poles,

270
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:42,900
birds have found the most ingenious ways

271
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:46,940
of overcoming the many challenges of life,

272
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:53,100
and everything revolves around their unique attribute, feathers.

273
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:28,900
For the past three years, the Life team has filmed birds in every part of the world imaginable.

274
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:33,540
Nowhere was the filming trickier than in the jungles of West Papua.

275
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:38,780
Here is found for me one of the greatest wonders

276
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:45,300
of the bird world, the display arena of the Vogelkop bowerbird.

277
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:51,060
13 years ago I was lucky enough to witness these spectacular builders,

278
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:55,140
but filming the timid female and courtship behaviour was a different matter.

279
00:48:57,140 --> 00:49:01,500
And this was what the Life team set out to film.

280
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:06,980
Barrie Britton was the principle cameraman for this programme.

281
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,580
With over 20 years in the business,

282
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:13,260
not only is he an accomplished photographer

283
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:17,820
but he has developed a deep understanding of and empathy for his subjects.

284
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:24,780
Although each one posed it's own unique challenges,

285
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:30,900
Barrie he did seem to spend an inordinate amount of time cooped up in his trusty old hide.

286
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:38,980
Think I may have misjudged the hide position, cos the sea's coming in the bottom of the hide.

287
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:46,340
Well, that was 11 hours in my little box.

288
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:52,300
Barrie saved his most ambitious trip of the series until last.

289
00:49:52,300 --> 00:50:00,020
It took a team of 40 people 3 days of tough uphill trekking to get to the filming camp.

290
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:06,500
I could complain about leeches, biting insects, the tough going

291
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:10,380
but, I really don't want to, this is great.

292
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:14,300
Seem to have lost everyone else, I hope I'm going the right way.

293
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,060
Oh, made it.

294
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:23,740
Completely shattered.

295
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:26,900
The hard work had only just begun.

296
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:35,500
Tomorrow with the help of their guides, the crew would go looking for the best bowers to film

297
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:38,980
but not before a cautionary tale from the local chief.

298
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:41,020
HE SPEAKS IN HIS OWN LANGUAGE

299
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:46,340
So when he first was shown the bower by his father

300
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:48,300
he, there were flowers there,

301
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:52,500
and, as a 12-year-old child he wanted to grab them

302
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,460
but his father immediately stopped him

303
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:58,660
and said, that he could not touch anything or take anything away from the bower

304
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:01,660
because otherwise it would start raining very heavily.

305
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:05,100
- Oh!
- It's ten to five, Barrie.

306
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:06,740
Yep.

307
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:09,540
With the chief's warning fresh in their minds,

308
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:13,140
Barrie and the team make an early start and head for the hide.

309
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:22,540
Well, we've reached the hide just at sunrise, so we're just gonna get set up as quickly as we can.

310
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:27,940
With knowledgeable guides, finding the bowers wasn't the problem.

311
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:30,940
And who could miss such obvious structures?

312
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:37,660
It was now a waiting game for Barrie,

313
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:41,300
heavily concealed in his camouflaged hide.

314
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:44,220
OK, it's 6.30,

315
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:49,220
so I'm just waiting now for the bird to come, hoping that

316
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:51,740
he doesn't suspect that anything is here

317
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:54,420
and that we can get some natural behaviour.

318
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:21,380
I've just heard the bowerbird call just to the right of the hide.

319
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:29,540
I can hear the bird outside, it's plucking on the fabric of the hide.

320
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:36,740
I've just noticed that the bird has pulled a Snickers wrapper out

321
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:40,940
of the bottom of the hide and has added it to its display.

322
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:47,740
It was a very strange decoration

323
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:51,220
which I had to remove at the end of the day.

324
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:07,700
Had Barrie tempted fate by removing the wrapper and ignoring the chief's warning?

325
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:15,020
Or was this just rainforest living up to its name?

326
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:21,100
When it pours like this, filming becomes virtually impossible.

327
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:34,100
Soon the weather improved and Barrie returned once more to the hide.

328
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:47,340
This time his lunch box was firmly sealed.

329
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:53,340
The bird is very keen on these little tiny metallic ladybirds

330
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:56,620
and they're a bit put out being put there in this bower,

331
00:53:56,620 --> 00:54:00,580
so, they start crawling off, they're very slowly making their way

332
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:04,100
over the moss and they just about get to the edge of display

333
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:09,220
and then the bowerbird notices and goes and collects them and puts them back again,

334
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:13,580
so they're kind of in this endless cycle of trying to escape from the bower,

335
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:16,060
they're just, they can never quite get away.

336
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:23,220
However for the male bowerbird and Barrie the female was still proving a problem.

337
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:26,980
The female did come down, but she was quite nervous

338
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:31,980
near the entrance to the bower, so we didn't get very much of that.

339
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:33,780
This was a real concern,

340
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:38,020
because the courtship behaviour was key to our story.

341
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:41,740
He's just done a 10-hour stint,

342
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:45,740
been a really nice day so we're just hoping it's gone well.

343
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:53,140
Another day's filming over, and still little to show for it.

344
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:55,540
10 hours in the hide.

345
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:57,820
Fortunately filming is over for the day,

346
00:54:57,820 --> 00:55:00,460
we're just gonna go and collect Barrie again.

347
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:02,420
Did you see a mate today?

348
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:04,860
No, no, mating.

349
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:07,820
Everything else is going well but we haven't got the mating.

350
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:15,620
The fact I was getting such good footage of the male meant he'd obviously got used to the hide.

351
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:20,380
But the visiting females were still wary of it.

352
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:26,580
The females did seem a bit nervous, so I took the decision to push the hide back,

353
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:33,260
just to get more distance from the birds, the other thing I've done is recessed the lens

354
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:39,460
and we put this vegetation all around it, so I'm hoping that's gonna provide more female behaviour.

355
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:47,020
There were few filming days left, it was crucial Barrie's adjustments paid off.

356
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:54,660
The male has just run into the bower and started calling

357
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:57,980
so I think that means there might be a female coming.

358
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:10,940
It struck me, here we both were waiting in the darkness,

359
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:13,460
the male trying to attract the female,

360
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:19,700
and I was just hoping that I'd got it right this time and it was more than just a fleeting visit.

361
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:31,860
Working in a hide involves hours of prolonged inactivity

362
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:35,020
punctuated by the most intense moments of action.

363
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:45,220
This was the crucial moment the whole team had worked towards.

364
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:54,460
Everything was falling into place for Barrie,

365
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:57,140
the behaviour unfolding.

366
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:59,460
Right, that's good, think we're in action.

367
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:06,500
21 days in a hide,

368
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:09,660
astonishing patience and perseverance.

369
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:19,020
This has never been filmed before.

370
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:30,500
Such effort and endeavour for a crucial piece of behaviour that's over in a matter of seconds.

371
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,780
Would you like to shake my hand, Stephen?

372
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:36,300
- What does that mean?
- Well, we got the mating.

373
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:38,980
- You got the mating?
- Yeah, yeah, we got the mating.

374
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:43,380
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah, so really good day, brilliant day, yeah but just, just amazing.

375
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:48,700
I must have - well, what is it - three weeks I've spent sitting in this hide, and I just didn't think

376
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:55,540
we'd ever get it, cos we're running out of days, only a few left now, so, so to get that this week is,

377
00:57:55,540 --> 00:58:00,860
is just incredible and it was a really, really good, really good behaviour, so I'm delighted.

378
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:08,540
Success! This was Barrie's last filming trip for the Birds episode

379
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:10,940
and what a befitting end.
