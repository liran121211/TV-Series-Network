1
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:30,850
Antarctica.

2
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:34,650
The earth's coldest continent,

3
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:38,150
the one that is most hostile to life.

4
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,750
Here, 800 miles from the South Pole,

5
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,350
it's 40 degrees below zero.

6
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:58,150
Of all the millions of species of animals on Earth,

7
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:01,250
only one can live here permanently.

8
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:12,350
A Weddell seal.

9
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:21,850
She can survive because she can dive below the ice.

10
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,140
Here she is protected from the storms above,

11
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,040
and here too, she can find food.

12
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:55,540
But she is a mammal, and she has to breathe air,

13
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:59,640
so she has to keep a lifeline open to the world above the ice.

14
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,340
Not only for her,

15
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,140
but now for her newborn pup.

16
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,240
SEAL GRUNTS

17
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,640
PUP CRIES

18
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,040
He's less than a week old, and still very vulnerable.

19
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,640
A blizzard blows in, and with it, storm-force winds.

20
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,340
It could last for a week.

21
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,640
Being mammals, seals can generate heat within their bodies.

22
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,240
And their fur, with a thick layer of fat beneath it,

23
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,540
prevents most of that heat from escaping,

24
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:55,140
even in cold conditions like this.

25
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,540
What is more, she is able to feed her youngster

26
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:09,040
with that mammalian speciality, milk.

27
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,140
And while she does so, she shields him from the worst of the blizzard.

28
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,340
She has worked hard throughout the winter to prevent her breathing hole

29
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,240
in the ice from freezing over.

30
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,740
That requires constant attention -

31
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,840
filing back the edges of the hole with her teeth.

32
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,740
Her pup needs to join her under the ice as soon as he can swim properly.

33
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:20,140
She encourages him to take his first plunge, but,

34
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,340
hardly surprisingly, he is not keen.

35
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:50,140
Now, guided by his mother, he has to learn how to hunt underwater,

36
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:54,040
and to find his way back through the maze to his hole in the ice.

37
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:15,640
A warm body, fur, milk and maternal care are essential

38
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,440
for the Weddell seal's survival in this freezing environment.

39
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:25,440
And those qualities have helped the mammals

40
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,440
to colonise the entire globe.

41
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,040
Equatorial East Africa.

42
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:45,540
It's hard to image a place more different from Antarctica.

43
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:52,340
To survive here, mammals need additional talents.

44
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:58,540
This tree shelters the territory of a tiny mammal

45
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:02,740
that spends its whole life in frenzied activity.

46
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,240
It used to be called an elephant shrew,

47
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,040
but now it's called by its African name of sengi.

48
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:21,340
This is a female rufous sengi.

49
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,940
And, like all sengis, she's so active, she's permanently hungry.

50
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,540
To get all the food she needs,

51
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:36,040
she has to be both industrious and ingenious.

52
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,140
She has made an intricate network of trails

53
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:50,440
that enable her to hunt her insect prey very efficiently.

54
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,640
But these pathways have another important function

55
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,740
when she meets her enemies.

56
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,640
Having a map of these trails in her head can mean the difference

57
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,140
between life...

58
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,140
..and death.

59
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,140
Like most mammals, and unlike reptiles,

60
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,740
her legs are directly beneath her body.

61
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,840
That makes her less stable, but much faster and more agile.

62
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:18,740
Not only has she outrun this reptile, she's outwitted him.

63
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,840
And just as well,

64
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,540
for she is a mother and has a youngster to care for.

65
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,940
The sengi relies on speed and cunning for its success.

66
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,040
Other mammals have very different techniques.

67
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,240
ANIMALS CALL OUT

68
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,940
Here in Madagascar,

69
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:00,440
one of the most bizarre of all mammals is on the prowl.

70
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,640
The aye-aye, like the sengi, lives on insects.

71
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,340
But the ones that she seeks, she can't see,

72
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:19,340
for they're buried deep inside branches.

73
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,740
They're beetle grubs.

74
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,840
To find them, she has a special talent.

75
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,140
She taps her fingers on the wood up to eight times a second,

76
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,840
and listens for the tiny change in resonance

77
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,540
that indicates a hollow spot within.

78
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:42,740
Her hearing is so acute, she can identify the precise position

79
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:46,140
in which to gnaw a hole in order to reach the grub.

80
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:52,340
And she has a grotesquely long middle finger

81
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,140
with which to skewer it.

82
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:11,340
It takes a young aye-aye four years to perfect this technique.

83
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,540
But once it has done so,

84
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:17,140
it can collect prey that no other mammal can reach.

85
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,140
The Arctic tundra.

86
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:41,140
Food is hard to find here too.

87
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,940
Indeed, this land is so barren that few large animals can live here.

88
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:51,540
Yet one mammal has found a way to do so.

89
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,740
It's late spring,

90
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,540
and as the mounting strength of the sun warms the land,

91
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,740
eight million reindeer move north.

92
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,140
But the vegetation is so meagre

93
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,740
that the only way the herds can get enough

94
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,540
is to keep constantly on the move.

95
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,740
Newborn calves soon discover

96
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:44,140
that they will have to spend every day walking in search of food.

97
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,640
They have extraordinary endurance.

98
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,340
Some of these animals, before they die,

99
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,640
will have trekked for a distance

100
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,040
equivalent to three times around the earth.

101
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,340
Grazing is now at its best.

102
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:07,540
But this also the time when the reindeer' worst enemy appears...

103
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,140
BUZZING

104
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,940
Biting flies.

105
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,940
The flies not only drive them to distraction,

106
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:20,540
but they can drain a pint of blood each day.

107
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:34,340
But the reindeer have a defensive strategy.

108
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:44,140
Each individual tries to push its way into the centre of a group

109
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,940
where there are fewer flies.

110
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,940
With all this pushing and jostling,

111
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,740
mothers need to keep their calves close.

112
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,740
Sometimes the flies become so bad

113
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,840
the reindeer can stand them no longer

114
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,940
and they bolt to higher ground where the flies can't follow.

115
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,940
But the price of escape can be high.

116
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,440
In the rush, one mother has lost her calf.

117
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,740
REINDEER CALLS OUT

118
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,340
Others have already found it.

119
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,740
BIRDS CALL OUT

120
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,640
The herd has long since moved on,

121
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,740
but her maternal instinct is so strong

122
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:19,940
she'll stay to search for her missing calf for days.

123
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:26,840
The reindeer are free from flies for now,

124
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,240
but with no food on these high slopes,

125
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,540
they will eventually be forced to descend to find new pastures

126
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:37,140
and face the biting swarms once more.

127
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:45,340
No animal makes a longer migration across the lands of the earth

128
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,840
than these mammals.

129
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:58,140
Other mammals have found a more economic way

130
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:02,240
of travelling huge distances and at greater speed.

131
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,540
They go by air.

132
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,840
BIRDS CHIRP

133
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,840
Giant straw-coloured fruit bats

134
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,340
inhabit the great forests of the Congo.

135
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,840
Their wings are nearly a metre across.

136
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,540
In late October every year,

137
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:58,140
they set off on a long journey across the forest canopy.

138
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,940
Flocks of hundreds become thousands.

139
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,340
And tens of thousands become hundreds of thousands.

140
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,840
They are fast and powerful fliers

141
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,740
and can travel a thousand miles in just a few nights.

142
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,740
THUNDER RUMBLES

143
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:40,040
How they know where and when to travel is a mystery,

144
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:45,940
but they all end up in one place - Kasanka, a remote swamp in Zambia.

145
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,640
There are ten million of them here.

146
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,040
They crowd together in just one small patch of forest,

147
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,540
no bigger than two or three football pitches.

148
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,440
And here they take up residence for a few weeks.

149
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,940
It's the largest fruit bat roost on Earth.

150
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,240
After their long journey, they need to rest and relax.

151
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,540
The roost is so crowded that complete strangers rub shoulders,

152
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:58,130
and even snuggle up together.

153
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:03,530
As evening approaches,

154
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:07,130
they prepare to reap the reward for their long journey.

155
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:24,130
They've come from all over Central Africa to this one place,

156
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,130
because here,

157
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,730
at this time of the year,

158
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:30,730
there is an extraordinary glut of mangoes and other fruit.

159
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:36,230
Streaming out from the roost, they set off to collect it.

160
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:12,330
Each bat guzzles at least two kilos' worth of fruit every night.

161
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:19,030
In just a few weeks, this mega-roost

162
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:22,430
will devour more than a billion separate fruits.

163
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:28,930
It's only the power of flight that allows these mammals

164
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:33,630
to travel so far and so fast that they can reap such a brief harvest.

165
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:40,630
After six weeks, the trees have been stripped of their fruit.

166
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:45,630
Then, once again, the immense aerial armada takes to the air,

167
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:49,330
each bat returning to its own particular patch

168
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,530
of the vast Congo forests.

169
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,630
The land mammals of Africa

170
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:37,030
also travel together in stupendous numbers.

171
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:42,730
The herds that graze the East African plains

172
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:45,630
are not nearly the size they were a century ago,

173
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:48,030
but they are still immense.

174
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:54,130
Grazing together is a good defence.

175
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:55,730
There's safety in numbers.

176
00:21:56,930 --> 00:22:00,830
But hunting together also brings advantages.

177
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,530
LION SNARLS

178
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:12,330
This hyena, however, is searching for food on her own.

179
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:17,530
She needs to be careful.

180
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:25,530
But she smells food.

181
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:29,330
And she takes risks.

182
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,330
HYENA YOWLS

183
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,530
HYENA SHRIEKS

184
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:38,730
Bruised and bloodied, she is lucky to have survived her mistake.

185
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:46,030
But she's not totally defeated -

186
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,930
she belongs to a clan.

187
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:51,830
A call to arms rings out through the night.

188
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:55,130
HYENA CALLS OUT

189
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:02,830
Reinforcements assemble.

190
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:10,530
Every adult in the clan responds.

191
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:23,830
If a clan attack together, they have a chance of challenging the lions.

192
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:26,130
HYENAS CALL OUT

193
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:33,530
LION SNARLS

194
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:43,530
It's a clan against a pride, each at full strength.

195
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:50,130
And the clan outnumbers the pride.

196
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:28,830
The combined power of the hyenas

197
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:31,730
eventually forces the lions to retreat.

198
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:35,830
Attacking as a coherent team

199
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:39,730
requires a high degree of social cooperation,

200
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:44,030
and that is another of the mammals' specialities.

201
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:57,530
Social bonds between mammals begin

202
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:00,330
when mothers feed their young on milk.

203
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:05,330
And few look after their young with greater care

204
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:08,730
than the mammal which dominates this landscape.

205
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:16,730
A female polar bear is trying to find food for her cubs.

206
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:19,830
But this is a particularly

207
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,930
difficult time of the year.

208
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:28,130
The sea ice on which she hunts is melting beneath her feet.

209
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:31,930
She must look for food on land.

210
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:12,030
They're all safely ashore, but they could still face months of hunger.

211
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:17,530
Finding food is not so easy on this cold and barren coast.

212
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:21,230
The search may be a long one.

213
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:31,930
Polar bears have an extraordinarily sensitive sense of smell.

214
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:36,530
And she has caught a faint whiff of something promising.

215
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:53,130
It's the immense carcass of a bowhead whale.

216
00:27:55,830 --> 00:28:00,730
A whale carcass could provide more than any one family could eat.

217
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:06,030
But they're not the first here to find it...

218
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:08,530
by any means.

219
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:16,330
The smell has brought in bears from miles away.

220
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:18,630
ROARING

221
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:24,230
Bear families seldom get on with one another.

222
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:38,430
She's taking a risk bringing her cubs here.

223
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:46,330
Male bears can, and do, kill and eat small cubs.

224
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,730
ROARING

225
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,430
Another family challenges her.

226
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:09,030
She must decide whether to compete for food, or run away and go hungry.

227
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:21,930
She keeps her cubs close to her and stands her ground.

228
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:39,130
Their mother's courage has won the cubs a meal.

229
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:08,230
Living as a family may bring rewards,

230
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:13,230
but it can also create problems, for siblings can also become rivals.

231
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:20,630
A coati - a South American relative of the racoon.

232
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:29,230
These babies were born in a nest high in a tree,

233
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:32,730
and are about to come down to the ground for the first time.

234
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:41,330
Some more reluctantly than others.

235
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:05,130
Once on the ground, the mother coati rounds her babies up

236
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:08,930
and takes them away to join a single large group.

237
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:17,530
Together, these families form a gang up to 40 strong.

238
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:27,130
Once again, numbers bring safety.

239
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,730
The first to spot danger will warn everyone.

240
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:45,330
But keeping order isn't easy,

241
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:48,330
and when they find food, it's a free-for-all.

242
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:08,530
Meerkats in the Kalahari Desert

243
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:12,630
also live in large groups, but they are rather more organised.

244
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:38,530
Each family band is controlled by a queen,

245
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:41,330
who is nearly always the only female to breed.

246
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:48,730
She has been kept very busy suckling her five pups,

247
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:52,330
and it's high time they became more independent.

248
00:32:54,930 --> 00:33:00,630
Today is the new brood's first trip to get breakfast for themselves.

249
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:14,530
It takes weeks for youngsters to learn how to find food.

250
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,830
MEERKAT SQUEAKS

251
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,830
This one is trying to catch ants,

252
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:27,830
but hasn't quite grasped the necessary technique.

253
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:37,330
But this youngster has persuaded an adult to show him what to do.

254
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:43,030
The tutor is not his parent, just an enthusiastic instructor,

255
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:47,430
and one who will adapt his lessons to the ability of his student.

256
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:51,930
This new one is a beginner,

257
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:56,730
so he starts with something easy - how to dig for insect larvae.

258
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:13,730
Other meals, like this one, are much trickier.

259
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:17,130
So the tutor disables the scorpion's sting

260
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:19,330
before he lets the youngster tackle it.

261
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:40,330
The family also cooperates in defence.

262
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:47,930
Every member does a tour of guard duty, keeping an eye out for danger.

263
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:50,030
So, while one watches,

264
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:52,130
everyone else can rest.

265
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:03,430
And, on warm days, one can easily nod off.

266
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:34,230
The secret of meerkats' success

267
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:37,930
is that everyone takes a turn in communal duties.

268
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:01,330
But many mammals do more than just share their workload.

269
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:08,130
Some can share their knowledge, and do so across several generations.

270
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:13,330
Elephant survival depends on profiting

271
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:17,030
from the experience of many lifetimes.

272
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:22,430
This baby elephant was born last night,

273
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:26,330
and the whole herd seems to welcome this new addition.

274
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,520
But the mother is young and inexperienced.

275
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,720
This is her first baby.

276
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,820
If she is to produce milk, a mother must drink.

277
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:01,020
And the newborn calf must keep up with her

278
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:04,220
as the herd continues on their long journey to find water.

279
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,920
After five miles, the calf is flagging.

280
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,520
Enough is enough.

281
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,620
The young mother encourages her calf to continue,

282
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,820
but there is still a long way to go,

283
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:34,620
and the calf is already getting dehydrated.

284
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:06,720
The elephants are now so close to water that they can smell it.

285
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,720
Water, at last.

286
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,720
ELEPHANT TRUMPETS

287
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,720
This is the calf's first encounter with a waterhole.

288
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:05,920
She's not sure what to make of it or, indeed, how to get out of it.

289
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,320
Her mother tries to help her,

290
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,920
but she has no experience of dealing with babies.

291
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:22,120
BABY ELEPHANT CRIES OUT

292
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:32,120
As the herd moves deeper into the swamp, the calf follows,

293
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,720
but now she is in real trouble.

294
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,720
BABY ELEPHANT CRIES OUT

295
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:48,520
Elephant babies can, and do, get permanently stuck in deep mud.

296
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:18,720
Her mother's attempts to help her baby are only making matters worse.

297
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,320
It's stuck beneath her and she's pushing it deeper still.

298
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:30,520
But now the baby's grandmother spots the problem and steps in.

299
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,120
MUFFLED THUMP

300
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,520
MOTHER TRUMPETS

301
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,520
Drastic action! She pushes mother out of the way

302
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,920
with an unceremonious poke in the rump,

303
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,220
and enables her granddaughter to scramble free.

304
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:59,920
Mother and calf have learned a valuable lesson from grandma.

305
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,420
Such passing of wisdom across generations

306
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:09,620
has been an important element in the survival of elephants.

307
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:30,720
The largest animal on land, the elephant is a mammal.

308
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:36,820
And so are the largest animals in the sea.

309
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:55,020
A female humpback whale and her calf.

310
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:00,320
Every few years, she will travel 3,000 miles,

311
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:03,420
from the rich waters of the Antarctic

312
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:07,920
to these warm, but comparatively sterile, waters of the Pacific

313
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,720
to give birth to a single calf.

314
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:43,520
The seas around Tonga are not only a nursery for humpbacks,

315
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,720
but also their mating ground.

316
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,720
WHALE CALLS OUT

317
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:03,120
This 50-year-old female has come here to seek the best partner,

318
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:07,920
and she starts by announcing her arrival to potential suitors.

319
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:34,620
One by one, the males arrive.

320
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:51,120
But as they do, she swims away,

321
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:56,120
compelling her half a dozen or so suitors to follow her.

322
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:13,520
She leads, while the males jockey for position behind her.

323
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,320
WHALE BELLOWS

324
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:18,320
The males bellow threats to one another,

325
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,920
creating huge plumes of bubbles.

326
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:34,120
So far, it has been a relatively gentle affair.

327
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,920
Now the competition becomes serious.

328
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:44,120
Hour after hour, the males battle for position, right behind her.

329
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:10,820
And now the 40-tonne males begin to smash into one another.

330
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:37,320
This is the most massive battle in all nature.

331
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,520
Rival males can kill one another.

332
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:53,320
As the conflict reaches its climax,

333
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,720
they try to force each other downwards.

334
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:19,020
At last, a victor takes his place alongside the female

335
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:21,220
and remains unchallenged.

336
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,220
By inciting the males to fight,

337
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:31,520
the female has secured the best mate for herself -

338
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:36,320
the one who is most likely to father the strongest offspring.

339
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:52,420
Together, the couple dive to the depths.

340
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:57,320
But still, no-one knows where they will mate.

341
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:27,820
All mammals, including ourselves,

342
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:31,220
share a set of winning characteristics.

343
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:43,420
Warm bodies, extraordinary senses and highly-developed intelligence -

344
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:49,320
and those qualities have contributed to their, and our, success.

345
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:57,920
But perhaps the most important characteristic of all

346
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,320
lies in the strength of our family ties.

347
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:08,120
It is the mammal family that has conquered the earth.

348
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:44,720
Tonga is famous for humpback whales,

349
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,520
but even here, finding and filming whales in the open ocean

350
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,220
would prove challenging.

351
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,020
For the Life team,

352
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:55,220
capturing the humpback whales' unique mating contest,

353
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:56,420
known as a heat run,

354
00:48:56,420 --> 00:49:02,320
would need local knowledge, hours on the water, and a big slice of luck.

355
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:06,320
We've heard that one of the boats further inland

356
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:10,220
has seen a female with a calf and an escort,

357
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:14,220
which is something which might build to, hopefully, a heat run,

358
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:16,720
so we're gonna head over there and take a look.

359
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:21,320
Any adult female with a calf could be coming into season,

360
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,720
and so might be a target for amorous males.

361
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,920
When we got there, I was pretty excited,

362
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,720
a little bit nervous, didn't know what to expect.

363
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:35,320
Once I got in the water and dived down,

364
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:38,020
it was surprisingly quiet and mellow.

365
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:42,120
Certainly didn't expect what happened next.

366
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,720
The calf just came straight up towards me.

367
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:17,120
She seemed really relaxed, and definitely interested in me.

368
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:27,320
It's literally just swimming around within metres of them,

369
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:30,720
flicking its tail, just being inquisitive I think,

370
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:31,920
and having a bit of fun.

371
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,620
It's obviously quite young,

372
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:41,120
so it's staying on the surface quite a long time.

373
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:43,020
It's not diving down for very long,

374
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:45,420
maybe a couple of minutes. The mother will be

375
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:48,320
about five or ten metres below just keeping an eye on it.

376
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:01,720
But even a calf has great power in its fins and tail.

377
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:05,220
Roger will need to be careful.

378
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,320
Got it?

379
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:24,720
That was the most silly thing I've ever seen in my life.

380
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:28,420
It was just gambolling around like a little newborn lamb.

381
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:29,520
But it's two tonnes.

382
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,820
THEY LAUGH

383
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:35,520
Couple of bumps as it's come round, splashed his fluke at me or whatever.

384
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,020
I got a great shot of it, Jason.

385
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:40,220
Jason was backpedalling like this!

386
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,320
It's just a baby. Like a little puppy,

387
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:48,520
you're playing with a little puppy, but it's four metres long.

388
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:52,420
- It's just ludicrous.
- Was his mum all right?

389
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:54,820
She is just totally chilling out underneath.

390
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:59,120
Pecs back. Just hanging like this at about 15 metres.

391
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,520
Yeah, just hanging there.

392
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,820
Probably didn't even see it, I don't think.

393
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:08,520
It's one thing to be close to a playful baby.

394
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,820
It will be another to be in the path

395
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:13,920
of a testosterone-charged group of males,

396
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,120
each ten times her size.

397
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:19,620
MUTTERED CONVERSATION

398
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:27,420
There are enough males here for a heat run, but are they in the mood?

399
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:29,820
Oh!

400
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:31,620
- Woo-hoo!
- Yes!

401
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:35,920
That was pretty good.

402
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:40,920
When you guys are ready.

403
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:43,620
Quick as you can.

404
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:56,120
These whales can weigh up to 40 tonnes and move surprisingly quickly.

405
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:58,520
As well as getting the camera to get the shots -

406
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,120
they have to be fairly close -

407
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:02,420
we have to be careful they don't get bumped.

408
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:04,720
If they get a knock from one of these guys,

409
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,820
it could do some serious damage.

410
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:14,620
He's right towards you.

411
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:17,720
To avoid disturbing the whales' behaviour,

412
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:23,220
the team need to free-dive, without scuba tanks,

413
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:25,420
holding their breath as long as they can.

414
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:29,820
On a good dive, I can hold my breath for maybe two minutes.

415
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:32,220
These guys, they can go for 20 minutes or more

416
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:34,220
before they have to come up for air.

417
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:35,920
There's no contest.

418
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,520
More and more whales are gathering,

419
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:41,720
but it's not turning into a heat run yet.

420
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:51,520
Hard to say what's going on.

421
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:55,620
Were there five that time?

422
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:01,120
They're kind of moving around, coming up and under and over.

423
00:54:01,110 --> 00:54:03,510
Hopefully, something's starting to happen.

424
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:04,910
Maybe love's in the air?

425
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:06,610
HE CHUCKLES

426
00:54:10,510 --> 00:54:14,610
Love may be in the air, but it isn't in the water.

427
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:18,310
Despite keeping tabs on the whales over the next ten days,

428
00:54:18,310 --> 00:54:21,010
there was still no sign of a heat run starting.

429
00:54:21,010 --> 00:54:24,410
You'd think it'd be quite easy to keep track of a 40-tonne animal.

430
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:27,510
And we've got six of them out here,

431
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:30,310
and we keep losing them. One minute they're there,

432
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:31,910
we get up reasonably close,

433
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:35,410
and within 30 seconds, they've dived and they're gone again.

434
00:54:35,410 --> 00:54:38,810
And then it takes another maybe five minutes, ten minutes,

435
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:42,110
and then they'll come up again and they'll be 300 yards away,

436
00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:44,510
and it takes ages just to get close to them.

437
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:48,910
So we're just playing a continuous game of cat and mouse.

438
00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:53,310
Cat and mouse? It's whales.

439
00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:57,210
The mating season is coming to an end,

440
00:54:57,210 --> 00:55:00,110
and the crew haven't completed their mission.

441
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:04,910
But then, at last, the whales' behaviour seems to have changed.

442
00:55:06,410 --> 00:55:07,410
Well, this is it!

443
00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:10,910
We just spotted about six or seven humpbacks on the horizon.

444
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:12,310
We think it's a heat run.

445
00:55:12,310 --> 00:55:15,510
The last 16, 17 days on the water

446
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:18,310
are probably gonna come down to the next two hours,

447
00:55:18,310 --> 00:55:20,310
as to whether we get our shots or not.

448
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:22,410
The chase is on!

449
00:55:49,410 --> 00:55:52,110
There was at least three or four males going past -

450
00:55:52,110 --> 00:55:54,810
they were competing and knocking into each other

451
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:57,810
as they tried to get the poll position behind the female.

452
00:55:57,810 --> 00:56:00,510
It's right at you, it's right at you.

453
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:05,010
The whales are moving so fast that, to stand any chance of filming them,

454
00:56:05,010 --> 00:56:08,910
the crew needs to be dropped right in front of the charging group.

455
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:26,310
Just as Roger gets alongside the males,

456
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:29,510
the tempo of the chase suddenly shifts to full bore

457
00:56:29,510 --> 00:56:30,910
with a flick of a tail.

458
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:50,410
Facing the charging males deep underwater, Roger keeps shooting,

459
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:53,010
holding his breath until the group pass over.

460
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:05,510
A quick gasp of air, and Roger's back down again.

461
00:57:15,410 --> 00:57:18,310
The whales continue to rush by.

462
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:21,910
In the end, Roger just can't keep up any longer.

463
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:34,210
Exhausted, it's time to return to the boat for the last time.

464
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:37,910
Amazing! That was the most amazing experience I've ever had.

465
00:57:37,910 --> 00:57:39,510
There was about...

466
00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:44,810
seven or eight. Both dived down about 20 metres in front.

467
00:57:44,810 --> 00:57:48,110
And then the female came through first, quite close.

468
00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:51,110
And then they all just started diving towards me,

469
00:57:51,110 --> 00:57:53,510
it was like standing in a stream of traffic.

470
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:56,710
It was just one one side, one the next side, one the next side.

471
00:57:56,710 --> 00:57:58,610
And then, after about 40 seconds,

472
00:57:58,610 --> 00:58:02,110
40, 45 seconds, I was getting a little bit out of breath.

473
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:07,610
And then I looked up, and there's one sitting right on top of me.

474
00:58:07,610 --> 00:58:10,310
- Did you get it?
- I think so. Hope so.

475
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:12,910
If not, then we're both fired!

476
00:58:14,810 --> 00:58:19,510
It's taken 18 days and hundreds of dives,

477
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:22,410
but at last the team have been able to reveal a secret

478
00:58:22,410 --> 00:58:26,710
of these whales' lives that few people have ever seen.
