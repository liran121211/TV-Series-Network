1
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,020
The island of Komodo in Indonesia.

2
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,520
Remote and barren.

3
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,030
Few people live here.

4
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:52,130
It's ruled by a giant reptile.

5
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,730
It looks like a survivor from the age of the dinosaurs.

6
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,440
The Komodo dragon.

7
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,340
9 feet long.

8
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,540
A top predator.

9
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:42,050
Only one thing can challenge a dragon's dominance.

10
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,750
Another dragon.

11
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:53,550
In the breeding season, males are drawn into savage conflict.

12
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:08,860
Huge claws and 60 serrated teeth can inflict terrible damage.

13
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:48,370
The Komodo dragon is the only reptile that still rules the land...

14
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:50,570
as the dinosaurs once did.

15
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,370
It can dominate here because it has no competition.

16
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:04,080
But for the rest of the world's reptiles and amphibians,

17
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,480
survival is a much tougher struggle.

18
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,580
Like the dragon, reptiles and amphibians seem primitive,

19
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,380
better suited to an earlier age.

20
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,780
Yet they have a surprising repertoire of extraordinary strategies.

21
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:34,890
And they still thrive in many parts of the planet.

22
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:47,690
This is the story of how they do so.

23
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,100
South America, the remote jungle where Brazil and Venezuela meet.

24
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,100
Sheer-sided mountains rise up from the jungle.

25
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,510
Few places on Earth are wetter.

26
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:37,010
It's the home of some ancient and very peculiar amphibians.

27
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:44,610
The waterfall toad is just an inch long, the size of a postage stamp.

28
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:51,410
Its special gripping hands enable it to clamber safely, high in the tree tops.

29
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,520
But it's not alone up here.

30
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:13,120
Most frogs and toads avoid predators by hopping out of danger.

31
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,420
But this toad never evolved the ability to hop for more than an inch

32
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:26,130
and that's nowhere near enough.

33
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:29,430
One way it gets eaten.

34
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,930
The other way is thin air.

35
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,630
Not much of a choice.

36
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,040
But this isn't suicide.

37
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,840
It's a deliberate strategy,

38
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,840
and one that depends on the size and strength

39
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,940
of those extraordinary hands.

40
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:05,640
Free-falling like this is a very effective way of escaping.

41
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:17,640
However, another toad on this same mountain has elaborated this strategy.

42
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,950
It lives a mile above the forest, on this plateau,

43
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,350
cut off from the world below.

44
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,650
This is a pebble toad.

45
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:46,050
It too is only an inch long.

46
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:55,060
These rocks may seem a paradise for a toad.

47
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,860
It's even wetter than the forest below and there are no snakes.

48
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,660
But there is a hunter here.

49
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:28,170
A toad-eating tarantula.

50
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:37,070
It ambushes its prey.

51
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:48,380
Like the waterfall toad, the pebble toad can't hop.

52
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,980
But it has a different defence.

53
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:16,690
It tenses its muscles, becomes rigid and turns itself into a rubber ball.

54
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:26,190
It's so tiny and weighs so little

55
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:30,690
that bouncing doesn't hurt it at all.

56
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,100
Bizarre innovations like these are one of the reasons why

57
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,700
amphibians and reptiles are still so successful.

58
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,010
Some of them, however,

59
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:12,510
have hardly changed for tens of millions of years.

60
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,710
Brazil's Pantanal.

61
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:32,310
Over 50,000 square miles of swamp.

62
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:40,320
In the dry season, the water is reduced to isolated pools

63
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,920
and then they contain the greatest concentration of crocodiles on Earth.

64
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,120
These caiman crocodiles

65
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,720
are trapped and fast running out of food.

66
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,920
It will be a long time before the rains return and the rivers rise

67
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,920
bringing with them the caiman's prey...fish.

68
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:09,330
Being cold blooded they can go without food for months

69
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:12,730
and stay inactive except when they squabble.

70
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:56,140
At last, the rains return and rivers swell.

71
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:15,150
All reptiles are experts at saving energy.

72
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:20,750
The caiman simply line up and wait for the fish to come to them.

73
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:03,370
Reptiles and amphibians must warm their bodies

74
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:06,570
before they can become active and until then

75
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:09,370
they are slow-moving and vulnerable.

76
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:25,870
The quickest way to gain heat is to bask in the sun,

77
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,780
as this basilisk lizard from Central America is doing.

78
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,580
The trouble is that exposing yourself

79
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,180
inevitably makes you easily seen.

80
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:43,080
But a conspicuous perch over a river like this

81
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:47,380
seems to be making yourself unnecessarily prominent.

82
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:52,780
This basilisk's greatest threat comes from the sky.

83
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,390
Dark shapes overhead make it nervous.

84
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:02,590
A hunting bird might expect it to flee to the trees.

85
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:08,590
In fact, it does the opposite.

86
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:17,290
This skitter across the surface of the water earns it precious seconds

87
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:20,790
and the nickname, Jesus Christ lizard.

88
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,900
It drives its feet down so hard and so fast

89
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,100
that it never sinks deeper than a few inches.

90
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,600
A human would need to run at 65mph to do this.

91
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:28,020
Reptiles are certainly expert at avoiding trouble

92
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:32,220
but they are also very good at finding a way to live in places

93
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,820
that don't seem to suit them at all.

94
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:51,730
They once included the largest animals that have ever walked the Earth...

95
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:54,730
the dinosaurs.

96
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:58,830
And some living ones are a million times smaller than T Rex.

97
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:02,630
Smaller indeed, than some insects.

98
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:19,130
The Brazilian pygmy gecko could sit comfortably on a finger tip.

99
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:25,340
It's so exceptionally small that no other reptiles compete with it.

100
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,840
But it's so nimble

101
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,240
it can escape from the hunting monsters of the undergrowth.

102
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:48,440
It is so small that it has special problems with, for example, rain.

103
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,150
It could drown in a drop

104
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,050
but its skin is hydrophobic.

105
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,850
Rain cannot wet it.

106
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:14,850
A tumble into a puddle, you might think,

107
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,360
would risk death by drowning.

108
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,260
But the gecko is unsinkable.

109
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:38,060
It's so light and its skin sowater-repellent

110
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,260
that it canliterally stand on water.

111
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:52,770
Such miniaturisation is certainly very impressive

112
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:57,170
but the reptile body can be transformed even more dramatically.

113
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:07,870
One of the most bizarre of allreptiles

114
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,280
hunts insects herein Madagascar.

115
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,280
The praying mantis has 360 degree vision

116
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,980
but it hasn't seen the danger thatisnow approaching.

117
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,090
A panther chameleon.

118
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:49,690
Every part of its body

119
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:54,690
has become specialised for a life of stealth among the branches.

120
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:00,790
Its toes have become grasping pincers.

121
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:07,790
Its eyes rotate so it can look in all directions.

122
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:15,300
Its skin can change colour for camouflage or to signal emotions.

123
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:32,300
The chameleon body is concealed from both predator and prey,

124
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,900
so it can launch a surprise attack.

125
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:49,310
The tongue is a like a missile,

126
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:53,910
aimed at its prey's head to neutralise its defences.

127
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,820
Chameleons, in short, are so perfectly adapted

128
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,920
to a life spent hunting in trees

129
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:20,920
that it's hard to imagine how they could live anywhere else.

130
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,130
The Namib Desert.

131
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:43,030
There are no trees for hundreds of miles.

132
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:49,930
Yet these are,undoubtedly, chameleon foot prints.

133
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:59,830
This female Namaqua chameleon is searching for a mate.

134
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:05,940
No part ofher body seems suited tosuch an environment.

135
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,940
Her feet, that could give her such a good grip on twigs,

136
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:22,040
shouldsurely be useless on soft sand.

137
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,940
But she's able to spread them like snow shoes.

138
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:30,240
She needs to get warm and active while the desert is still cool

139
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:33,750
so she exploits the chameleon's versatile skin.

140
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:37,750
The side facing the sun goes dark to absorb the sun's heat,

141
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,950
while the other remains light

142
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:43,350
and minimises the heat escaping from her body.

143
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:56,150
She's hungry and food is scarce.

144
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:00,660
But she's still not quick enough to grab these desert beetles.

145
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,160
Her solution is simple.

146
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,970
She finds, at last, a little vegetation

147
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:31,470
and waits for ashade-seeking beetle to come to her.

148
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:55,980
On she goes, in her search for a mate.

149
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,580
At last, a wandering male.

150
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:25,990
But he may not treat her as she might wish.

151
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:45,790
The courtship of most chameleons is gentle.

152
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:47,590
But in this desert,

153
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
a male meets a female so rarely he can't risk being rejected.

154
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:19,300
She marches on, now carrying a new generation.

155
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:42,410
A six-month freeze,

156
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:46,810
when temperatures may drop to minus 40 degrees centigrade,

157
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:50,820
should surelymake things impossible for a reptile.

158
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:58,820
But here in Canada, beneath the thawing snow, something stirs.

159
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,220
A male red-sided garter snake.

160
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:07,220
He survived the winter by hibernating underground

161
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,520
where the temperature never dropped below zero.

162
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:17,230
The weak sun persuades more males to emerge.

163
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:26,630
They are cold and can't move fast, yet they are in an urgent race.

164
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:30,330
The first males to warm up will have a head start,

165
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:32,730
when the first females appear.

166
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,540
Melt water provides the first drink they've had for six months.

167
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:14,050
At last, a female has emerged.

168
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:19,050
The warmest males will inevitably be the first to react to her smell.

169
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:23,250
She will only mate once, so competition between them is intense.

170
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,960
This male has overslept.

171
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,360
He will need hours to warm up.

172
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:54,560
At the moment he stands no chance of mating.

173
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:11,970
Most of the other males are ready to chase females but, curiously,

174
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,970
some leave the race and go to join the cold male.

175
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,870
They slide their warm bodies over him,

176
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:28,170
just as they would if they were courting a female.

177
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:38,470
More and more males crowd round him. Why?

178
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:44,880
Their relative temperatures show what's going on.

179
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,080
His cool body, showing as blue,

180
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:58,280
is quickly warming as it absorbs heat from the other males.

181
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:02,080
He's a trickster, he's fooled the others by giving off a scent

182
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,080
just like a female's and they are trying to mate with him.

183
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:12,690
He only needs a few minutes of this to steal enough heat from his rivals

184
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:15,490
to catch up and join the chase.

185
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:19,490
Every spring, tens of thousands of garter snakes

186
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:23,490
fight it out in this mating frenzy.

187
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:34,490
It is, in numbers, the greatest gathering of reptiles in the world.

188
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:57,400
Getting a mate is just the first challenge a reptile faces

189
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,600
whenit's ready to breed.

190
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,810
This collared iguana in Madagascar

191
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:06,710
will only lay one batch of eggs thisyear,

192
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:09,510
so she needs somewhere safeto hide them.

193
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:18,710
Her eggs are much sought after by predators,

194
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:21,110
they'reexcellent pre-packaged meals.

195
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:28,110
She appears to have the answer.

196
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:55,520
She covers all traces of where she buried them.

197
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,420
It's a good strategy.

198
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,930
But not good enough.

199
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:10,230
Hog-nosed snakes have learned to keep watch on iguana nesting sites

200
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:14,530
and to note the precise place where the eggs lie buried.

201
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:25,130
She has been completely outwitted.

202
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:44,340
She can only stand by and watch as her precious eggs are eaten.

203
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:47,740
Next yearshe'll have to find a nesting site

204
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:50,540
without a hog-nosed snake.

205
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:15,350
On the other side of the world, in the Sonoran Desert of Arizona,

206
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:18,650
a similar drama has a very different outcome.

207
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,460
A female horned lizard guards herburied eggs

208
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,160
and is keeping a lookout for anything

209
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,360
that mightinterfere with them.

210
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:45,360
A western patch-nosed snake.

211
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,660
It is an egg-eater.

212
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,360
And she won't stand for it.

213
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:23,680
The patch-nose is no match for this kind of aggression.

214
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:33,980
Her eggs are safe, for now.

215
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,180
Another predator, a coachwhip snake.

216
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:43,180
And this species is a lizard eater.

217
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:48,180
And she can tell the difference.

218
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:51,690
The snake is too fast for herto outrun it.

219
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:55,890
So she makesherself look larger and taller.

220
00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:00,490
The snakeis wary of swallowing anything

221
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:03,190
thatlooks as big and as spiky as this.

222
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:09,790
And now the lizard plays her trump card.

223
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,800
The snake isn't accustomed to prey that does this.

224
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,200
One very confused snake.

225
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:57,710
Now she can return to guard duty,

226
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:02,410
and several months later she's rewarded with her first baby.

227
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:19,620
Looking after your eggs is an even greater challenge for reptiles

228
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,620
thathave left land to live in the sea.

229
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:28,220
The Pacific island of Niue is home to the world's entire population

230
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,220
ofone particular type of sea krait.

231
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:37,420
This snake is superbly adapted to life underwater

232
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:41,020
except when it's time to breed.

233
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:46,730
After a few minutes in a mating coil, the female is fertilised.

234
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:49,730
But now she has a problem.

235
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:52,730
Reptile eggs can't survive underwater,

236
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,330
the developing young would drown.

237
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:57,730
They have to be able to breathe air.

238
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:02,830
She and her eggs are both vulnerable to predators,

239
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:05,330
if they return to land.

240
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:08,630
But she hasan extraordinary solution.

241
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:21,340
She dives beneath the island.

242
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:26,440
To find the entrance to a long underwater tunnel.

243
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:53,450
At the far end is a cave with an air pocket.

244
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:12,360
This is the dry land her eggs need.

245
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:16,660
There are no predators here.

246
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:23,260
The cavern is sealed by a roof above and the water below.

247
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:27,060
She searches for a crevice where she can deposit her eggs.

248
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:44,770
The eggs will be completely safe here

249
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:47,470
and she can return to the open sea.

250
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,280
Six months later, a baby snake takes its first breath.

251
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:45,290
Somehow, the young snakes must find their own way to water.

252
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:57,490
Then down the tunnel and out to sea.

253
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:36,910
A male giant bullfrog.

254
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:41,610
Reptiles and amphibians rarely care for their young after theyhatch

255
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:46,710
but this South African bruiser is an exception.

256
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:54,510
The males sort out their dominance through combat.

257
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:58,110
The strongest will mate with the most females.

258
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:46,730
You might not expect such anaggressive male

259
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:48,630
to bea caring father.

260
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:53,130
Yet one male stays behind to watch over, not just his own,

261
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:55,740
but everyone else's offspring.

262
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:13,140
The females laid their eggs in the shallows

263
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,340
around the margins of the pool.

264
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,650
But the sun is intense

265
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:25,950
and the shallows have shrunk to a single pool.

266
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:35,750
There's a real danger that the tadpoles will be stranded.

267
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:38,250
The guardian male recognises the problem.

268
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:50,250
They will be dead within an hour unless he can do something to help.

269
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:05,260
There is only one thing he can do to save them.

270
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:13,760
Dig a channelto themain pool.

271
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,680
They're safe.

272
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,180
Remarkable innovations have made amphibians and reptiles

273
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,980
amodern success story.

274
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:21,190
What is more, among their ranks is one reptile

275
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:25,490
that is stillan undisputed top land predator.

276
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:27,990
The Komodo dragon.

277
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:35,390
They mostly hunt deer, which they ambush and easily overpower.

278
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:40,690
But in hard times the dragons risk hunting something much bigger.

279
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:46,700
Water buffalo, an animal ten times their size.

280
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:59,400
Until now, adragon hunt has never been filmed.

281
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,700
It's the dry season.

282
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:07,600
A buffalo sleeps through the heat of the day

283
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,700
in one of the last waterholes.

284
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:16,910
Dragons lurk around the margins.

285
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:22,010
The buffalo seems to view them as just an irritation,

286
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:23,510
not a danger.

287
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:27,310
A serious mistake.

288
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:43,310
The dragon is wary a jab or a kick could injure it fatally.

289
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:18,930
The bites are just flesh wounds but other dragons are alert now.

290
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:22,430
Like sharks, they're excited by blood.

291
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:36,830
The buffaloleaves with just a limp.

292
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:43,440
The dragons appear to have failed.

293
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:53,840
Yet they show a peculiar interest in the buffalo

294
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:56,440
and follow it wherever it goes.

295
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:11,450
As the days pass, the buffalo's wounds don't heal.

296
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:13,350
It starts to weaken.

297
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:18,750
The dragons' hunting method begins to come clear.

298
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:25,050
A brand new discovery reveals that the dragon has venom, like a snake.

299
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:27,750
The bite will eventually prove fatal

300
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:30,650
but it's going to take several weeks.

301
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:45,560
The dragons, however, can afford to wait for a meal of this size.

302
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:51,860
They simply stick close to their victim and conserve their energy.

303
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,360
Thousands of years ago, dwarf elephants lived here.

304
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:02,660
The dragons probably hunted them in exactly the same way.

305
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:08,470
But the process is a long, drawn out one.

306
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:11,970
Three weeks later and the buffalo is very weak.

307
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:43,280
The dragonssense that the end is near.

308
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:51,680
They must remain wary, the buffalo could still lash out.

309
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:04,890
Gradually they closein to try and finish it off.

310
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,500
The dragons'strategy is certainly merciless

311
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:44,400
but it is the only way that they can get a meal like this

312
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,300
and in hard timesthey need it if they're to survive.

313
00:47:04,010 --> 00:47:07,910
The buffalo died in the night.

314
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:16,110
Tenbig dragons have gathered to feed.

315
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:26,710
They strip the buffalo to the bone in just four hours.

316
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:38,520
This is the biggest venomous animal on the planet.

317
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:04,530
We don't need tales of Jurassic Park and Velociraptors

318
00:48:04,530 --> 00:48:07,930
to see a reptiledominated world.

319
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:09,830
It's all here.

320
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:31,040
No-one has ever before followed the whole process

321
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,840
of aKomodo dragon hunting a buffalo.

322
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:43,240
So cameraman Kevin Flay and researcher Matt Swarbrick

323
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:45,440
didn't know what to expect.

324
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:48,940
They thought it would be a physicalchallenge

325
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:51,650
but they hadn't bargained for emotional turmoil as well.

326
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:04,350
They reached Komodo after a four day journey.

327
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:06,650
Kevin, an expert at filming reptiles,

328
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:08,850
knows they're in dragon territory.

329
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:11,350
Lookhow wide that is.

330
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:13,150
Look at that.Yes.

331
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:17,950
Their only protection is these rangers, armed with sticks.

332
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:29,460
These big ones look really scary, actually.

333
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:32,460
And not until you get, till they come really in close

334
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:36,460
and when they're by the camera, then you tend to question your faith

335
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,360
in our friends with the sticks.

336
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:52,770
But this dragon isn't a big one.

337
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:57,570
At five foot, this dragon is just over half grown.

338
00:49:57,570 --> 00:50:00,170
The really big ones live in land,

339
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:03,670
which is exactly where Kevin andMatt must go

340
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:07,970
to find a place where dragons and buffalo might meet.

341
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:15,870
We could spend five weeks walking around all over the island

342
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:19,980
just trying to find dragons randomly coming across buffalos

343
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:22,780
but fortunately for us it is the dry season

344
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,580
and there's only one decent waterhole left on the island

345
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:30,980
and both the dragons and the buffalo require water, obviously,

346
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:32,880
which brings them together.

347
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,780
Kevin decides to wait here,

348
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:37,880
but aftera few days with no sign of dragons,

349
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:40,980
it looks like the wrong decision.

350
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,680
Oh, here comes a buffalo.

351
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:46,590
You know this is about as, as exciting as the day gets.

352
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:48,090
Look.

353
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:54,590
See that.

354
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:56,590
Hello, mate.

355
00:50:56,990 --> 00:50:59,690
After almost a week something changes

356
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:02,590
and a couple of dragons appear.

357
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,600
Have we got a ranger here?

358
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,300
Guys, can we have a ranger?

359
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,000
Always know how dangerous a situation is,

360
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:21,400
but it does seem a bit concerning

361
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:24,000
that one of our rangers is sat up in a tree.

362
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:34,700
But the dragons show no interest in the buffalo or the crew

363
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:37,200
and the frustration continues.

364
00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:40,210
Yet their task seems so simple.

365
00:51:40,210 --> 00:51:42,610
So all we need

366
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:48,010
isfor him to film him attacking him.

367
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:55,110
But it looks like he isabout to attack him.

368
00:52:01,010 --> 00:52:05,010
Just cut myself, that's not good in dragon country.

369
00:52:04,310 --> 00:52:06,110
I better be careful.

370
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:09,720
Now we've gotta start our walk home, it takes just over an hour

371
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:12,820
but the thing is, if stuff's happenedand you've got,

372
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:15,920
you've managed to film good stuff then it, it's really easy,

373
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:18,120
you just trot on home andfind some dinner

374
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,620
and find out what the rats have done to your room.

375
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,020
But it's still really hot at this time of day

376
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:24,620
and so, if you've not filmed a lot

377
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,620
and you've just sat here all day long,

378
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:28,520
thenit's a hell of a long walk home.

379
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:33,920
They have a lot of long walks home but finally a new dragon appears,

380
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:38,130
something about its attitude seems different.

381
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:42,630
Maybe we could be onto something but I've now lost that other dragon,

382
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:44,630
which makes me a bit nervous.

383
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:51,430
At first it's wary,

384
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:54,530
unwilling to get too close to the buffalo.

385
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:07,140
Big dragons involved here.

386
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,640
That came from absolutely nowhere.

387
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:20,440
That guy has got some real attitude.

388
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:44,650
That first bite and the smell of blood set off a chain reaction.

389
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:47,050
All the dragons seem to come to life.

390
00:53:52,850 --> 00:53:57,150
The peaceful watering hole is now a dangerous place to be.

391
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:07,460
Well, I've definitely got two heads at the moment,

392
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:10,060
one as a cameraman saying, "Yes, brilliant!"

393
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:13,260
And the other one's thinking, "That poor animal," you know,

394
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:15,560
"That's not nice, that's really not nice."

395
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:25,660
Quickly, quick,

396
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:28,060
quick, quick.

397
00:54:40,970 --> 00:54:44,270
My heart's pumping a bit.

398
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:48,670
At least my heart still works. Good Lord, that was a bit hairy.

399
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:53,870
Now the crew must follow the buffalo everyday

400
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:56,070
to finish their filming job.

401
00:54:56,080 --> 00:55:00,280
This begins to take a toll on their emotions.

402
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:04,080
He knows he's injured, he can't walk properly

403
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:08,280
and he's got these predators just gathering around him,

404
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,680
waiting for the opportunity.

405
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:11,980
It's gruesome.

406
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:16,980
Shadowing the buffalo means staying close to the dragons too.

407
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:21,180
This is mad we've, just, just followed a, the buffalo

408
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:24,680
and, I think, six dragons, I've lost track now,

409
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:28,690
I think it's six dragons, down into the riverbed

410
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:31,490
and, you know, it's, they're stalking it,

411
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:33,290
we're all a bit nervous,

412
00:55:33,690 --> 00:55:37,090
this is actually quite frightening, I have to say.

413
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:48,090
They're so capable and so unafraid of us

414
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:51,490
and they would have no problems at all

415
00:55:51,490 --> 00:55:54,590
of causing us major, major damage.

416
00:55:56,100 --> 00:56:01,700
At the moment I feel about 5 to 10% confident that I'm safe here

417
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:04,900
but the truth is we just don't know.

418
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:16,500
As the days pass,Kevin and Matt

419
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:21,100
can't help butfeel more deeply involved.

420
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:25,310
I'm sure they're starting tothink of us as death,

421
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:26,710
you know, the camera team.

422
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:29,710
Because, although we, you know, we're not influencing it

423
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:32,910
in anyway, really, we're always therewhen the dragon's there

424
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:35,910
and, you know,she's sick so we're following her

425
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:38,110
and you see her looking backat you

426
00:56:38,110 --> 00:56:42,110
and I'm sure I feel like death and his scythe's comingin to kill.

427
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:46,410
I'm not really that sure how cut out I am for this.

428
00:56:46,510 --> 00:56:51,410
If, if the game is spendingall your time watching an animaldie...

429
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,220
I don't know about that.

430
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:59,520
The dragons seem brutal,

431
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,820
yet this is the only way they can get large prey.

432
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:13,020
For the team, the event has become personal.

433
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:18,020
I think as we've got to know himand, you know,

434
00:57:18,030 --> 00:57:21,730
we've seen him everymorning, we've seen him everyevening

435
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:24,730
and, you know, you build up arelationship with him

436
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:27,430
and, and todayI think he, he kind of gave up.

437
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:36,330
The next dayit isall over.

438
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:48,430
Now it's over, you sit back and reflect and you sort of feel,

439
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:49,940
that was just astonishing.

440
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,440
And it feels so primeval.

441
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:59,140
It feels we're watching something from a different era.

442
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:03,140
And they really are the most fantastic things to be with.

443
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,740
Scary....

444
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:06,940
awesome, you know, to look at

445
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:11,740
you just feel that you are looking at something from Jurassic Park.
