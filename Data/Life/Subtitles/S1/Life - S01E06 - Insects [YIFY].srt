1
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:32,150
There are more kinds of insects in the world than all other kinds of animals put together.

2
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,150
But because they are so small,

3
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:38,050
we rarely see how extraordinary they are.

4
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:43,150
Occasionally, they assemble in astonishing numbers.

5
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:50,750
A billion monarch butterflies hibernate in the forests of Mexico.

6
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,940
Vast clouds of mayflies emerge all at once to mate.

7
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,540
Insects face endless challenges.

8
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,740
They can transform their bodies to meet every purpose -

9
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,140
eyes grow onstalks. Bodies become chemical guns.

10
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,040
To discover how and why they do suchthings,

11
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,340
you have to enter theirworld.

12
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:02,130
Patagonia, Chile, home to one of the most extraordinary of beetles.

13
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,820
There are many kinds of beetles in the world,

14
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:12,120
but this one hassome of the biggest jaws of all.

15
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:15,020
He is Darwin's beetle.

16
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,320
He is on his way to the forest to look for a mate.

17
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,720
Whether he gets one or not will depend on his strength...

18
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,120
and on the size of his jaws.

19
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,610
He starts his search.

20
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:50,210
A female is likely to be on a tree trunk.

21
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:57,110
But trees, in this part of the world are very tall.

22
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:04,010
His search could be a long one.

23
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:13,500
Unfortunately for him, she is 25 metres above him

24
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,100
near the top.

25
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,600
She has more normal-sized jaws.

26
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,100
But thenshe only needs them for feeding.

27
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,200
But he needs immense jaws forfighting...

28
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,500
..because there are other males aroundwith the same mission.

29
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:53,290
Sheer strength isnot enough in these battles.

30
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:57,990
The technique is to reach over your opponent's head

31
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:01,490
and hook your jaws under his wing-covers.

32
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,890
That's why his jaws are so long

33
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,590
and have that odd shape.

34
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,090
He's got the grip.

35
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,690
Now he as to lift.

36
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,080
And that needs strength.

37
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,780
Another lift is needed.

38
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,880
And that's that.

39
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,780
Beetle armour is strong so he bounces.

40
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,070
The winner climbs on.

41
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:54,070
There are more males ready to fight him up here.

42
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,760
And here she is at last.

43
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,160
But she doesn't seem to be in the mood.

44
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:59,850
So now he has to use his great jaws as a restraining cage.

45
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,650
Success at last.

46
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,750
But the hurling habit dies hard.

47
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:31,240
Insects' bodies have the capacity to take on an almostinfinite variety of shapes.

48
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,240
This is oneof the keys to their success.

49
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,840
This male moth doesn't go in search of females.

50
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:02,030
He inflates a pair of scented plumes

51
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,530
that protrude from the end of his abdomen.

52
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,630
And they come to him!

53
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:17,230
All insects have the same basic design...

54
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:21,630
six legs and an armour-covered body.

55
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:24,130
But the different parts can become exaggerated

56
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:27,030
tosolve particular problems.

57
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:36,520
This beetle has a giraffe's neck in order to fight.

58
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,920
A praying mantis is disguised as a flower

59
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:48,120
and waits in ambush.

60
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:54,320
Another is almost invisible amongdead leaves.

61
00:07:54,420 --> 00:08:00,320
Insects' armour can carry colours that can camouflage or communicate.

62
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:21,510
But the armour can also be converted into wings

63
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:24,210
and that makes insects a globalforce,

64
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:28,610
enabling them to invade almost every habitat on earth.

65
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,600
In Southern France,

66
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,800
one insect is starting on the most important day of its life.

67
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,000
Dawn, and a newly hatched damselfly.

68
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,600
She needs to mate and lay her eggs before sunset.

69
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:13,790
Her adult life is so short, she may not get another chance.

70
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:23,290
Her success will depend on these fragile wings.

71
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,590
She faces many perils.

72
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:43,190
Few insects can escape from a spider's web.

73
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,080
But her wings are more powerful thanthey look.

74
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:01,480
She wants to mate with the strongest male.

75
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:07,380
However, the stream, where she might find him, is a battle-ground.

76
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:18,770
She watches while dark-winged males compete for the best territories,

77
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:22,970
flashing their wings at each other in threat,

78
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:25,770
or trying to force their opponents into the water.

79
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:37,970
Fighting finished, the female uses her wings to signal her presence to the winner.

80
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,860
She won't be rushed.

81
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,960
But if he doesn't grip her with his tail, a rival might steal her.

82
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:03,360
As they mate, their linked bodies form the shape of a heart.

83
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:12,460
But now she has the problem of laying her fertilised eggs and that brings new hazards.

84
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:24,150
Like any athlete, she must warm her muscles for optimum performance

85
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:28,350
and does so by using her wings as solar-heating panels.

86
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:35,950
She must fly dangerously low if she's to find the right place for her eggs.

87
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,840
Only the quickest damselflies escape.

88
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,730
Safely past the frogs,

89
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:32,930
this femalehas reached a suitable planton which to lay her eggs.

90
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:37,130
But she has to place them underwater if they are to survive.

91
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:41,130
For the first time, her wings seem to be a hindrance.

92
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:43,330
But in fact, they help her yet again,

93
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:48,130
by trapping a silvery layer of air which enables her to breathe.

94
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:57,730
She cuts into a plant stem and deposits her eggs inside.

95
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,720
Now herwings are going to be truly tested.

96
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,220
If she can't break through the water surface, she will drown.

97
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:56,510
Her day has been a complete success.

98
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:04,510
Damselflies seldom venture beyond their home stream.

99
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,500
But some insects fly huge distances.

100
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:14,000
September on the shores of Lake Erie in Southern Canada.

101
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,500
A monarch butterfly is fuelling up on nectar.

102
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,900
A chill gust of Northerly air.

103
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,800
It's time to leave.

104
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:40,490
The coming winter will be so cold it would kill her.

105
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:52,490
She has never flown more than a few hundred metres in her life.

106
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:57,990
But now she is heading out over Lake Erie,

107
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:00,890
which is a hundred miles across.

108
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,880
This is just the first leg of one of the greatest animal migrations.

109
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:24,380
She will continue South, using thesun as a compass,

110
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,780
to cross America, a journey of 2,000 miles.

111
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:39,880
Her destination is Mexico and one small and special group of trees.

112
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:44,470
No-one knows how she finds them, in these great mountain forests.

113
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:53,970
She joins other monarch butterflies that have travelled here from all over North America.

114
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:02,570
Countless butterflies crowd these particular trees,

115
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,870
hanging from every branch.

116
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:18,460
They come here because, although winter brings a chill to the air,

117
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:22,360
there will not be a lethal freeze as there will in Canada.

118
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,560
The conditions are perfect for hibernation.

119
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:37,660
Hibernating butterflies are vulnerable to predators.

120
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,860
But monarchs are poisonous.

121
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,360
However, a few birds have learned to rip out the toxic parts and eat the rest.

122
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:50,250
They kill hundreds of thousands of butterflies and dislodge many more.

123
00:16:54,250 --> 00:17:00,450
Those that fall must get back into the trees before nightfall brings another killer.

124
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:03,450
They vibrate their wings to warm their flight muscles.

125
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,750
But it's a race against time.

126
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:15,850
Night brings a lethal ground frost.

127
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:59,730
Those that do survive, sleep safely huddled together in the trees, for four months.

128
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:09,930
The warmth of spring wakes them from their hibernation.

129
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:27,210
The majority of the butterflies that flew here from Canada have survived.

130
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:32,410
They take their first drink since their arrival last autumn.

131
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,700
With increasing warmth, more and more butterflies awake.

132
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,500
Soon they will all disperse northwards

133
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,200
and tranquillity will return to this forest

134
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:07,000
untilthe great grandchildren of these butterflies return to escape the freezing Northern winter.

135
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:37,990
Some insects, however, have made a speciality of living in the most adverse conditions.

136
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:49,580
Mono Lake is known as California's dead sea.

137
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:55,080
It's twice as salty as the ocean and lethal to almost all life.

138
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:08,080
Alkali flies are one of the few creatures able to tolerate these conditions

139
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,870
and since they have virtually no competitors,

140
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,270
they swarm in their millions.

141
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:39,370
Flies are one of the most successful of all insects.

142
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,360
There are 85,000 different kinds

143
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:47,760
and among them, a perfect fly for almost every habitat, even this one.

144
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:10,960
The alkali fly has special abilities that enable it to live on this lake.

145
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,560
It can walk underwater to eat algae.

146
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:17,750
Fine hairs trap air bubbles that prevent it from drowning.

147
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:21,850
But most critically, the flyhas a physiology

148
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:25,650
that can neutralise the lethal levels of salt.

149
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:31,650
So the alkali fly's dominance of Mono Lake goes unchallenged

150
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:35,150
except for a few weeks of the year.

151
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:50,140
100,000Wilson's phalarope are migrating to South America.

152
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:53,540
Mono Lake is their only stop-over.

153
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:59,340
These alkali flies, for them, are an invaluable and irresistible feast.

154
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:12,540
A fly has no defence, except tofly and become lost in a vast swarm.

155
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:22,730
It needs considerable skill to pluck an individual fly from the air.

156
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:29,130
There are gulls are here, too.

157
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:37,730
Though their fly-catching techniques are not so refined.

158
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:10,720
In four weeks, the phalaropes double their weight.

159
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:14,320
Then they set off again, heading south.

160
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,320
Leaving the gulls behind.

161
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,520
The size of the fly population has scarcely been affected.

162
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:30,310
For them, sheer abundance is defence enough.

163
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:33,210
BUZZING

164
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:47,810
But for some insects, defence is a much more complicated affair.

165
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:53,510
An oogpister beetle in South Africa.

166
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:55,910
He hunts ants.

167
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:08,300
Eating ants may give him more than just nourishment.

168
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,200
He may get something else from them that helps him fight his enemies.

169
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:29,700
The ants launch a counter-attack and nip his ankles.

170
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:32,190
But he simply kicks them out of the way.

171
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:45,590
The valiantants drive him off...

172
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:48,690
straight into real danger.

173
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:54,290
A mongoose.

174
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:02,090
It's inquisitive.

175
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,380
But it's also wary of the oogpister.

176
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,180
A black and white pattern is a warning signal.

177
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,180
The beetle takes aim...

178
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:20,280
And fires formic acid straight at the mongoose's eyes and mouth.

179
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:28,680
The beetle probably collected this acid from the ants.

180
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:35,280
It certainly makes the beetle itself very distasteful and that, in turn, makes it worth mimicking.

181
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:39,870
This defenceless little lizard carries the beetles' warning pattern.

182
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:45,870
It also imitates the way the beetle runs.

183
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:51,370
Not particularly well, it's true, but well enough to

184
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:56,270
fool predators into thinking it just might be an acid-firing beetle.

185
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:11,060
All kinds of insects have developed chemical weapons.

186
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,560
A pair of devil-rider stick insects.

187
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:24,260
They fire bitter-tasting oils, terpenes.

188
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:33,260
European wood ants under attack from a hungry crow.

189
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:37,960
They fire the sort of acid that gives nettles their sting,

190
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,760
so this is like one of us falling into a nettle patch.

191
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:56,250
But the master of chemical warfare is the bombardier beetle.

192
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:01,250
It can create a chemical reaction within it's body so violent

193
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:06,050
that boiling caustic liquid explodes out of its abdomen.

194
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,140
By pulsing the jet 500 times a second,

195
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:21,640
it keeps its rear end just cool enough to prevent it being cooked.

196
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,340
In the woodlands of Minnesota,

197
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:47,040
there is an insect that has another chemical weapon.

198
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:53,230
But this one fights as an army and can stand up to almost any predator.

199
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:08,630
Bees collect nectar all day and transform it, within their stomachs,

200
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:12,230
into one of nature's richest foods, honey.

201
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:22,520
Hundreds of them are bringing their precious loads back to their colony in this hollow log.

202
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:37,120
The honey in their combs provides food for their young

203
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:42,120
and for the whole colony if the weatherturns cold or there's a drought.

204
00:29:54,810 --> 00:30:00,110
But so much food attracts thieves.

205
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:05,410
A black bear cub has a sweet tooth.

206
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:11,210
But he's never come across bees before

207
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:14,810
and he doesn't know that they will defend their honey to the death.

208
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:23,210
Stinging is the ultimate self-sacrifice for a bee,

209
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,600
because itcan't pull out its barbed sting.

210
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,800
So its body is torn apart.

211
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,200
The bees' attack was far too much for the cub.

212
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,400
But a greater challenge is coming.

213
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,190
The cub's mother!

214
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,990
ANGRY BUZZING

215
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:10,090
The bees fight so hard that she only has time to steal a single comb.

216
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:22,390
While the family enjoy their honey at a safe distance,

217
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:25,590
the beesappear to have been defeated.

218
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,780
Their home has been destroyed

219
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:38,280
and their young will inevitably die out in the open.

220
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:44,980
Yet the colony is not doomed because the workers are now rescuing at least some of what really matters...

221
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,580
..their honey.

222
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:56,280
Each survivor is able to eat its own weight in honey, storing it in its stomach.

223
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:05,570
They will have to abandon their dying young,

224
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:08,570
but they will take much of their precious honey with them

225
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:12,270
to sustain themselves while they build a new colony.

226
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:21,770
Working together in such an organised society is the insects' great innovation.

227
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:25,970
So how did it begin?

228
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,060
It may have started in a place like this -

229
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:39,260
the nest of the Japanese red bug.

230
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:49,160
Parent insects don't usually care for their offspring but this bug is different.

231
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:00,560
The young feed on fallen fruit from just one kind of rare tree.

232
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:10,850
They could neverfind it by themselves. So theirmother collects it for them.

233
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:29,750
She probes every fruit she finds

234
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:33,550
to test its ripeness

235
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:35,550
and rejects one after another.

236
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:40,050
This can take hours.

237
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:46,340
At last, a perfect fruit.

238
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,540
A thief!

239
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,940
It's easier to steal than find food for yourself.

240
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:07,540
For both bugs, the outcome of this dispute will be life-changing.

241
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:14,530
As the mother struggles to keep herprize,

242
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:17,530
her young, back in the nest, are growing restless.

243
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:26,430
The thief has won.

244
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:33,130
The mother doesn't know that her hungry young are leaving their nest in search of a better provider.

245
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:43,630
She returns

246
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:46,520
to find that her nest is empty.

247
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:02,620
Her young find the nest of the thief, who is herself a mother.

248
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:11,120
She returns to find that she has twice as many mouths to feed.

249
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:20,910
The loser has failed at her only chance of parenthood.

250
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:30,510
For the thief, life has suddenly got much harder.

251
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:34,110
A fruitwon't now last as long as it did.

252
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:39,110
The youngclamber over her, demanding more.

253
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:02,300
She returns with another fruit but her enlarged and

254
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,500
insatiable brood want still more.

255
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,500
So she has towork non-stop, day after day.

256
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:29,790
At last, the young become big enough to fend for themselves.

257
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:32,890
But their success has come at a cost.

258
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:36,590
The mother has worked herself to death.

259
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:44,190
And now her body hasbecome their last meal before they leave home.

260
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:47,890
Looking after the young in such a way

261
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:53,090
is thought to be the first step towards living in a community.

262
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:04,080
But some insects benefit from doing the opposite of collaborating.

263
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,780
They kill one another.

264
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:11,380
Dawson's bee is one of the largest in the world.

265
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:18,280
It nests in the baked soil of the Australian outback.

266
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:23,780
Flowers are rare in thisdesert, so colonies of these bees are few and far between.

267
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:35,670
The bees excavate tunnels fortheir young.

268
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:50,270
The community is so harmonious that it's hard to believe that this place

269
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:53,370
is also the setting for mass murder.

270
00:37:57,570 --> 00:38:01,970
Tempers do flare when a bee gets confused and goes down another's burrow.

271
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,860
But these are minor disagreements.

272
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:15,460
The colony is peaceful at the moment becauseevery bee here is a female.

273
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:19,860
It's the males that are the killers and they are all dead.

274
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,360
Their story began two monthsearlier,

275
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:29,060
before theappearance of the females.

276
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:35,150
Male Dawson's bees.

277
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:47,450
The females are only just emerging, burrowing their way, one by one,

278
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:49,950
out of the tunnels where they hatched and grew up

279
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:52,350
and their scent enflames the males.

280
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:58,050
They arehuge and built for fighting.

281
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:04,450
And each one wants to be in the best position to mate with a female.

282
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:24,140
A female emerges and immediately there's a brawl

283
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,440
as every male tries to reach her.

284
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:32,440
It's very rare for animals to kill their own kind in combat,

285
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:34,640
but stinging and biting rivals to death

286
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:39,440
is usually the only way these male bees get a female.

287
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:55,230
A winner manages to claim a female and the pair race for cover.

288
00:39:57,130 --> 00:40:02,330
Meanwhile, the female's lingering scent drives one unsuccessful male

289
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:03,930
into a deadly frenzy.

290
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:12,030
Another female, caught in the middle of another brawl, becomes an accidental casualty.

291
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:24,420
By the time the last female has emerged, every male is dead.

292
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:30,220
The battles have ensured that the strongest males will have mated with the most females.

293
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:38,420
Two months later and it's an all female world

294
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:41,820
with thenext generation already developing underground.

295
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:09,610
Insects have evolved sophisticated societies that, in complexity,

296
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:13,610
are the closest thing in nature to our own cities.

297
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,100
The insects that built this structure in Argentina

298
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:36,100
dominate the surrounding grasslands thanks to skills that seem almost more human than insect.

299
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,300
It's a metropolis,

300
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:47,000
a home to millions of ants.

301
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:52,590
The colony needs a huge supply of food.

302
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:56,190
It's surrounded by grass,

303
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:59,990
but the ants themselves can't digest a blade of it.

304
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:04,390
Nonetheless, they collect it.

305
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:11,790
Although they're all the same species, they exist in different shapes and sizes.

306
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:22,990
The heads of these big-jawed individuals are not full of brain...

307
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,880
but brawn.

308
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,480
They give the species its name.

309
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:28,980
They are grass cutters.

310
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:41,980
They work all day, every day.

311
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:13,770
The smaller ants, down on the ground, are porters with the job

312
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:16,970
of carrying the grass segments back to the colony.

313
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:34,160
They have great strength. Their main problem is balance.

314
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:06,450
Columns of them carry the grass back to the nest along highways

315
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:08,650
as straight as Roman roads.

316
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:20,750
Different members of the colony specialise in particular tasks inmuch the same way as people do.

317
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:28,750
But, as in human society, there can be problems.

318
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,850
A hitch-hiker makes one ant's job much harder.

319
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:37,340
And this isn't even grass.

320
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:03,940
A single colony harvests half a tonneof grass a year,

321
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:06,930
more thanany other animal on these plains.

322
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:10,930
But since they themselves can't eat it, why do they do so?

323
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:20,330
The answer lies underground.

324
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:25,930
They haveone of most extraordinary survivalstrategies in the insect world.

325
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:30,930
The ants have dug a network oftunnels

326
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:34,730
that extend downwards for over seven metres.

327
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:44,920
At the heart of the colony lies the key to their survival. A fungus.

328
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,120
But this isn't sloppy house-keeping.

329
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:50,420
This is a fungus that is found nowhere else on earth.

330
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:58,220
And the ants cultivate it assiduously.

331
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:02,720
The big-jawed ants chop up the grass covering it with an

332
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:07,920
antibiotic saliva that kills every kind of fungus except this one.

333
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:14,810
The ants are farmers.

334
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:17,110
They feed the grass to the fungus

335
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:18,710
and the fungus thrives.

336
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:28,710
The ants cultivate dozens of these fungus gardens throughout the colony.

337
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:33,310
This is what they eat.

338
00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:39,910
The system is so efficient that a single colony can have five million members.

339
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:44,210
But the fungus is also dangerous.

340
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:52,900
As it grows it releases carbon dioxide that could asphyxiate the entire colony.

341
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:58,000
The ants' way of dealing with this danger is ingenious.

342
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,600
They construct their nest so that it has an automatic air-conditioning system.

343
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:11,100
The outer surface is so shaped thatthe slightest breeze

344
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:15,000
sucks out staleair through these central vents.

345
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:19,690
At the same time, fresh air is drawn down through the outer vents,

346
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:22,190
right into the heart of the nest.

347
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:31,890
Our own societies have existed for thousands of years

348
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:36,790
but insectsocieties have lasted for millions.

349
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:49,790
There may be ten million different kinds of insects

350
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:55,180
and there are 200 million individuals for every one of us.

351
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:01,380
The insects' flexible armour and their adaptability

352
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:07,480
has made them the most abundant andthe most diverse animal group in our planet's history.

353
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:32,870
The Sierra Madre Mountains in Mexico

354
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:36,070
are home to one of the greatest natural wonders.

355
00:48:39,870 --> 00:48:45,970
A billion bright orange butterflies offered the Life team a wonderful filming challenge.

356
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:53,670
The colonies are only found above 3,000 metres

357
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:57,960
and the team trek there slowly in the thin air.

358
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:15,960
The monarch phenomenon was only discovered here around 30 years ago and one man has been studying

359
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:19,660
them every year since, Professor Lincoln Brower.

360
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:23,660
His knowledge will be essential if the team are to achieve their goal

361
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:28,060
of flying a camera among the butterflies.

362
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:31,050
It's amazing that the butterflies only come to this area

363
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:34,850
that's about 30 by 60 miles in extent.

364
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:38,950
There are other areas that have high forests,

365
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:43,850
in different parts of Mexico, to the west of here, to the south of here,

366
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:50,250
but as far as we know, this is the only place that monarchs are able to spend the winter.

367
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:54,650
The butterflies are in such numbers that filming them the traditional way,

368
00:49:54,650 --> 00:49:58,650
from a camera on a tripod, is reasonably straightforward.

369
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:03,240
But to get a butterfly's viewpoint by flying a camera amongst

370
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:07,140
the swarms is going to be altogether more difficult.

371
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:15,040
First, the team need a spot where butterflies gather in huge numbers.

372
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:24,240
Luckily, Lincoln knows a place where thousands come down to drink every day.

373
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:28,940
The crew spend the next three days preparing the equipment -

374
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:35,540
a remote-controlled camera, a lot of cable, two bicycle wheels, a bag of rocks and some muscle-power.

375
00:50:39,330 --> 00:50:45,730
Now all they need to do is wait until the butterfly numbers reach truly impressive proportions.

376
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:53,830
By mid-day, the butterflies are swarming

377
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:57,630
and it's time for the camera to glide with them through the air.

378
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:59,130
Three and away.

379
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:14,820
Superb. OK, let's just stop that.

380
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:16,220
Absolutely stunning.

381
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:18,820
We've got great numbers coming in. Let's keep going

382
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:21,820
and then we'll do a turn round shot.

383
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:27,020
A series of unique shots flying withthe butterflies.

384
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:35,820
But that was the easy part.

385
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:42,010
Now it's time to get the camera 50 metres up into the tree tops.

386
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:49,810
Filming the roosting butterflies is not going to be simple, the clusters are unstable.

387
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:53,710
And they can suddenly disperse without warning,

388
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:55,710
what Lincoln calls an explosion!

389
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:59,310
Here'sanother explosion. Wow, look at that!

390
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:01,910
And they're going right over our head.

391
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:09,810
Spectacular, no doubt, but a real problem for the climbing team, Jim Spickler and Tim Fogg.

392
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,300
Would it be better for us to start now?

393
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:14,800
we're gonna be very careful not to disturb them,

394
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:19,200
or limit our disturbance, but if we do disturb them right now

395
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:23,400
it seems that they're warm enough that they could relocate to a cluster right adjacent to them,

396
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,000
do you think that's true?

397
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:30,600
Well, if you disturb them they tend to fly away from the tree, 50 feet or so,

398
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:35,000
so you'll lose those clusters I think if you disturb them.

399
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:41,100
Do you think they'll cluster again though, tomorrow night?Idoubt it.

400
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:42,790
< I think they'll just move down.

401
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:50,590
That's really hard stuff, you know because I can't seehow we can get up the trees

402
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:52,190
and do what we have to up there,

403
00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:54,790
close to any clusters without them flying.

404
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:58,590
I just don't know how I'm gonna be able to get an arrow into the tree.

405
00:52:58,590 --> 00:53:02,090
I think if you picked your tree, you could put the arrow in it now.

406
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:08,190
The prospect of rigging cables high in the canopy, without disturbing

407
00:53:08,190 --> 00:53:14,190
the butterflies is a daunting one. They may only get one chance.

408
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:16,080
One false move and it'll all be gone.

409
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:18,580
I had the impression that they might come back but

410
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:22,080
Lincoln says they just won't, they'll just move on to another tree.

411
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,980
So we put all the rigging in, disturb them and then...

412
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:26,980
that's it!

413
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:31,180
Choosing which trees to rig is a critical decision.

414
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:37,280
Can you get right to tree number six do you think, or is that too far?

415
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:48,780
They begin by firing a line over a suitably high branch.

416
00:53:58,670 --> 00:54:00,170
That'll work.

417
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:07,770
Nobody, not even Lincoln, knows how the butterflies will react.

418
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:15,170
Yeah that's gonna work perfect, I think.

419
00:54:15,170 --> 00:54:17,070
OK, great.

420
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:19,970
I've got to do a changeover here so just give me a moment.

421
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:30,160
There's an explosion.

422
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:39,560
Thankfully, it's not in the trees that Jim and Tim are rigging with such care.

423
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,060
Can you just push it towards me a bit?

424
00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:53,850
Ouch.You OK?

425
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:56,950
Yep.OK, get your fingers out.

426
00:54:56,950 --> 00:54:58,950
OK, that's good.

427
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:07,350
It takes another three days to get theaerial rig set up, followed by many hours of fine tuning.

428
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:10,950
Just pan it so we don't see it in the monitor, please.

429
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:20,950
Everything is finally set and the butterflies are still there.

430
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:25,150
One, two, three.

431
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:30,040
Take one.

432
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:39,540
Too slow.

433
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:41,540
There was no load at the beginning

434
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:44,740
and thensuddenly it just completely stopped.

435
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:51,240
Take six.

436
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:56,040
Keep going. Start to slow, slow and keep going, keep going, keep going.

437
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:57,740
OK, Mike, hold it.

438
00:55:57,830 --> 00:55:59,830
Not far enough.

439
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:02,330
We've not got enough weight, Jim.

440
00:56:10,930 --> 00:56:12,730
Take nine.

441
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:13,730
Go on, Mike.

442
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:17,730
Go on, Mike. Get in close, Mike, now start slowing.

443
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:19,030
OK.

444
00:56:19,130 --> 00:56:23,430
It's still not right and now time is running out.

445
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:25,330
I think the light's going.

446
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:27,530
Shall we do one last take?

447
00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:31,830
All right. Because these ones here, we're losing the light on them.

448
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,820
Try and get a shot that's going past here if it's smooth.

449
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:41,720
One, two, three, and we're away.

450
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,020
Take 17.

451
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:51,120
And it's looking good.

452
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:56,620
OK, start slowing, Mike. OK, keep it going, keep it going.

453
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,520
Success at last.

454
00:57:05,610 --> 00:57:10,210
With the technique now working, the crew rig more and more shots

455
00:57:10,310 --> 00:57:15,210
to give an aerial perspective on the monarch phenomenon.

456
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:26,010
His work advising the crew over, Lincoln continues the observations

457
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:28,910
he's been making for over a quarter of a century.

458
00:57:28,910 --> 00:57:32,110
Although the butterflies are still here in immense numbers,

459
00:57:32,110 --> 00:57:36,010
he's worried there is a threat to their survival.

460
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:42,500
The big, huge influx, maybe sometimes as many as two billion butterflies,

461
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:46,700
flying down into this tiny area of 30 by 60 miles,

462
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:51,200
is thoroughly endangered by illegal logging.

463
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:55,100
If the forest is not protected the phenomenon will be lost.

464
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:08,400
It'd be a disaster.

465
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:15,290
I mean, it would be like taking the Mona Lisa out of the Parisian museum and,

466
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:16,890
and burning it up.
