1
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:31,700
Plants have a family tree stretching back nearly half a billion years.

2
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,700
They have developed an extraordinary range of strategies to survive.

3
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,400
This tree is a bristlecone pine.

4
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,900
It's taken thousands of years to reach this size.

5
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,200
It has seen empires rise and fall,

6
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,300
kings, queens and presidents come and go

7
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:01,600
and may have seen the sun rise more than 1.5 million times.

8
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,700
Bristlecone pines are the oldest living things on Earth.

9
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,600
Bamboo is the fastest growing plant.

10
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:27,900
It will be full-grown - 30 metres tall - in just 90 days.

11
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,900
Like animals, plants are constantly competing for food.

12
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,600
Striving to produce offspring

13
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,200
and battling against predators.

14
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,600
They will deceive and, in some cases,

15
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,000
they will even hunt.

16
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,400
We often don't notice such dramatic behaviour because, to our eyes, it happens so slowly.

17
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,200
But if time is compressed

18
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,200
and you shift perspective to the plants' point of view,

19
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,200
their world comes spectacularly to life.

20
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,000
The events in this woodland

21
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,600
can build to a view of half a year in less than a minute.

22
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,800
Like animals, plants need food and water.

23
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:59,400
But what sets them apart is their struggle for light.

24
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:16,400
Plants must have light in order to grow and will do anything to get as much as they need.

25
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:26,200
The forest might appear to be the perfect place for plants to thrive.

26
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,200
Yet down here on the forest floor

27
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,400
is one of the hardest places imaginable

28
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,200
for a young plant to begin its life.

29
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,400
The canopy above is so thick

30
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,400
that only a little sunlight can filter through.

31
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,200
For this sapling, too little light means death.

32
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,600
But plants on the forest floor need not be passive.

33
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,900
If the light won't come to them,

34
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,900
they can go to the light.

35
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,800
But they still have a problem.

36
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,800
The light is 50 metres above them.

37
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,400
So, they must climb.

38
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,300
It's much easier to use another plant as scaffolding.

39
00:05:54,900 --> 00:06:00,400
But they won't get very high unless they can hold on tight.

40
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,100
Like fingertips searching for a hold,

41
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,900
this ivy's adhesive pads grip the bark.

42
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:18,400
Instead of sticking to the trees, some climbers use sharp claws.

43
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,400
The cat's claw creeper hooks its tendrils into the tiniest crevices

44
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,500
and hauls itself to the top.

45
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,900
With every metre it climbs,

46
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,700
the light gets a little stronger, fuelling more growth.

47
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,100
This tendril of a passion flower seems to flail aimlessly in mid-air,

48
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,600
but in fact it's searching for an anchor point.

49
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Its tendril coils on itself, pulling the plant towards its support.

50
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:23,300
In a matter of just days, these climbers make it to the canopy.

51
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,600
Now with light in plentiful supply, these plants are able to flower.

52
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,300
Other plants have a different strategy

53
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,700
to find the light they need in the crowded forest.

54
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,500
These are air-plants.

55
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,700
They grow on the upper branches of tall trees

56
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:54,400
and spend their whole lives basking in the light.

57
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:01,000
But growing 50 metres above the ground does have its drawbacks.

58
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,800
Most plants get water and nutrients through their roots in the ground.

59
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,300
For an air-plant, with their roots planted in the tree tops,

60
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,900
this isn't an option.

61
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
But they have a solution.

62
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:24,200
First, the bare roots have an extraordinary ability to soak up water like blotting paper.

63
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:31,500
The slightest rain or mist, and they absorb every drop.

64
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,500
They also have a way of gathering nutrients.

65
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,300
Their roots trap falling leaves which eventually rot

66
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:49,400
and provide the plants with their own personal supply of compost.

67
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,600
20,000 different plants -

68
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,900
orchids, bromeliads and ferns have taken up this remarkable lifestyle.

69
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:31,400
For a plant to thrive, it must not only get enough nutrients,

70
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,400
but also the right balance of nutrients.

71
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:41,000
The soil in this waterlogged bog is very poor quality, lacking in nitrogen.

72
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,000
But these strange plants have an ingenious strategy.

73
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:55,600
Their leaves are covered in tentacles, tipped with droplets of what appears to be morning dew.

74
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,200
These droplets give the plant its name - the sundew.

75
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,300
They're sweet-smelling and attractive to many insects.

76
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:17,100
But they're also extremely sticky.

77
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:26,000
Mosquitoes emerge in huge numbers from the boggy water

78
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,300
and the sundews are ready.

79
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,800
The sundew's tentacles are living fly-paper.

80
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,100
Struggling only makes matters worse.

81
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,500
With each contact, the plant tightens its grip.

82
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,200
As more and more tentacles envelop the prey,

83
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,700
the droplets spread across its body.

84
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,900
Eventually, the insect is smothered and drowns in sticky fluid.

85
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,800
Digestive enzymes break down the body into a nitrogen-rich meal

86
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,200
which is absorbed by the plant.

87
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,100
Without animal tissues this plant would not survive.

88
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,900
But there's another carnivorous plant

89
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:07,000
that's an even more sophisticated predator.

90
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,800
The Venus fly trap.

91
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,100
Like the sundew, it makes itself very attractive,

92
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,600
oozing nectar across the brim of each leaf.

93
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:51,600
But any visiting insect had better watch out for these six tiny hairs.

94
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,600
This fly has to tread carefully.

95
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,600
If it strikes one hair,

96
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,000
it can carry on feeding.

97
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,700
But a timer has been set.

98
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:35,100
A second strike in less than 20 seconds and the fly is doomed.

99
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:50,100
An electrical impulse is triggered and the leaf snaps shut in just a fraction of a second.

100
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:55,800
The tips lock together like prison bars.

101
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:10,000
If the fly is very big, or very small, it may just manage to escape.

102
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,100
But most are trapped.

103
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,000
And die.

104
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,000
Ten days later, the trap re-opens.

105
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,900
All that remains is a husk.

106
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:54,000
The plant has finished its meal and resets itself for its next victim.

107
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,500
But there is one time of year when the Venus fly trap

108
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,600
needs some of the visiting insects to live.

109
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,500
It needs their help to be pollinated.

110
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,300
It sends up flowers on tall stems,

111
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,800
well away from the danger of the traps below.

112
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:33,700
Here, insects can feed safely on nectar.

113
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,200
In return, they provide a vital service,

114
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,000
carrying pollen from flower to flower.

115
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,800
But the truce is only temporary.

116
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:54,400
When pollination is over, it's back to business as usual.

117
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,500
80% of plant species on Earth have flowers.

118
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Flowers have just one role -

119
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,300
to enable the plant to produce offspring.

120
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,000
Colour, perfume, nectar and shape

121
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,300
all act to make a flower irresistible.

122
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:29,300
Sunflowers grow to face the rising sun.

123
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:33,200
The warmth of the rays speeds the production of nectar

124
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,400
and this lures pollinators.

125
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,500
One after another,

126
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,800
hundreds of individual florets produce pollen-covered stamens.

127
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,300
And, like most flowers,

128
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:01,300
sunflowers establish a close relationship with animals

129
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,100
in order to ensure their reproduction.

130
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,400
As these bees busily feed on nectar,

131
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,300
they unwittingly brush against the stamens, collecting pollen,

132
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,900
and then carry it from flower to flower.

133
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,700
The sunflower is fertilised.

134
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,500
In the sun-drenched fields of southern France,

135
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,400
the flowering season is a long one,

136
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,700
but not all plants have this luxury.

137
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:50,100
Cradle Mountain in Tasmania is blasted by bitter Antarctic winds.

138
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,200
To reproduce, the Richea honey bush must flower.

139
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,300
But the delicate parts of the flowers risk being damaged by the cold.

140
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,600
The plant appears to have an ingenious solution.

141
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,200
The flower petals fuse together,

142
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,500
forming an insulated, protective case around its stamens.

143
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,200
However, this creates another problem,

144
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,400
the flower case is so well sealed that, unfortunately,

145
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,500
it also keeps out pollinating insects.

146
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,400
During brief, sunny spells,

147
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,000
the flowers warm up and suddenly start producing nectar.

148
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,300
This attracts a bird - the Black Currawong.

149
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,800
It has the strength to rip open the flowers' outer casing

150
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,900
and gets its reward of nectar.

151
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:55,100
At the same time, it exposes the delicate stamens to waiting insects.

152
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,400
With luck, there's enough time for pollination

153
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,800
before the biting wind kills the flowers.

154
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:20,200
For some plants, the relationship with their pollinators

155
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,900
is not collaborative,

156
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,700
it's war.

157
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,300
Butterflies, and in such numbers,

158
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,200
would seem to be perfect pollinators for any flower.

159
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:36,400
The Sandhill milkweed blooms every spring

160
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,300
in the sandy meadows of Florida.

161
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,500
It times its flowering perfectly to match the arrival

162
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,600
of Monarch butterflies migrating here from Mexico.

163
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,400
The Monarchs search out milkweed plants,

164
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,000
but they have something other than pollination on their minds.

165
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,200
Rather than collect pollen,

166
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,800
this female lays her eggs on the milkweed leaf.

167
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,000
This is the only plant the caterpillars can eat.

168
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,600
But the milkweed has a defence mechanism.

169
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,000
As the caterpillar bites into a vein,

170
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,400
a kind of latex swells out engulfing it.

171
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,500
If the caterpillar isn't quick, it will drown...

172
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,400
or find its jaws glued together.

173
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,200
The plants' defence is so effective

174
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,200
that only one third of the Monarch caterpillars

175
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,000
make it through the first day.

176
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,700
But the caterpillars that survive, grow in size and strength.

177
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,200
And they go for the jugular.

178
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,600
By carefully chewing through the main vein,

179
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,000
the caterpillar drains the leaf of latex

180
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
and cuts off its supply.

181
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,200
The milkweed's leaf is now defenceless

182
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,600
and the caterpillar eats in safety

183
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,900
before preparing to pupate into a butterfly.

184
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,700
But after about ten days,

185
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:46,200
it becomes clear why the plant has endured this onslaught.

186
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,200
A newly-hatched Monarch simply can't resist the nectar-filled cups

187
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,700
of the milkweed flowers.

188
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,600
As it moves across the flower heads,

189
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,200
its feet slide between grooves in the petals

190
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,000
where the flower's pollen sacs are waiting.

191
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,200
As it flies off, the Monarch's feet hook out the pollen

192
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:16,100
and carry it to the next flower and pollination is achieved.

193
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,800
Although the milkweed has paid a heavy price,

194
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,400
in the end it used the Monarch to get its way.

195
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,800
Here in Dominica there's a plant that is so manipulative

196
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,500
that it has enslaved its pollinator.

197
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:40,400
The bright red structures of the Heliconia are actually modified leaves.

198
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,800
These are its flowers.

199
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,600
They may be small, but they play a very important role

200
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,600
keeping nectar well guarded at the very bottom of their long stems.

201
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,700
The purple-throated Carib hummingbird,

202
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,600
with its long curved beak,

203
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,000
is the only bird capable of reaching this energy-rich food.

204
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:10,100
But, cleverly, the Heliconia rations the amount of nectar it produces

205
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,800
to force the hummingbird into returning to the flower

206
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,200
time and time again.

207
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,300
Every time it makes a visit,

208
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,400
it picks up more pollen on its beak and feathers.

209
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,600
The hummingbird is like an addict.

210
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,300
Not only does it never stray,

211
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,800
but it will aggressively defend the flowers from thieves.

212
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,000
The plant is the master in this relationship.

213
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,800
To ensure it gets pollinated,

214
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,900
Heliconia has made the hummingbird its prisoner.

215
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,000
A plant's problems don't end once it's been pollinated.

216
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,700
Plants need to spread their seeds as far away as possible,

217
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:14,100
otherwise the adults will be in direct competition with their offspring.

218
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,400
Here in South Africa, one flower achieves this

219
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,100
by performing a remarkable trick.

220
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:34,300
The plant waits dormant underground for more than a year.

221
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,500
The first heavy rains for many months

222
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,300
are the trigger the plant has been waiting for.

223
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,000
Brunsvigia burst into flower.

224
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,500
Their timing is perfect.

225
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:13,400
These conditions are ideal for insects too.

226
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,700
The flowers enjoy a few days of frenzied pollination.

227
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:35,500
But it's not long before the searing heat returns.

228
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:39,400
The flowers start to wilt, shrivel and die.

229
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,700
Brunsvigia now needs to disperse its seeds widely,

230
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:53,800
yet the flowers still have their seeds trapped inside.

231
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,000
But the flower isn't finished yet.

232
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,400
There are strong winds that blow across this landscape.

233
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,600
They snap the dry, dead stalks, sending each and every plant

234
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,600
cart-wheeling across the ground, casting seeds as it goes.

235
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,500
With the heat threatening to dry them out,

236
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,800
the seeds' germination has to be immediate.

237
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,700
Deep in the forests of Borneo,

238
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:12,600
some plants also use the wind to disperse their seeds,

239
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:17,400
but in a completely different way - by giving their seeds wings.

240
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,000
Some are helicopters that twist and turn their way down to the ground.

241
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,000
But there is one that has a design

242
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,400
that enables it to travel greater distances than all the others.

243
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,800
This is Alsomitra.

244
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,800
Its football-sized pod

245
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:56,000
is packed full of hundreds of extraordinary seeds.

246
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:02,200
Each is an almost aerodynamically perfect glider

247
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,300
that can be supported by even the slightest breeze.

248
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,100
Its paper-thin upswept wings

249
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:15,700
allow it to travel hundreds of metres through the forest.

250
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,000
Once the seed hits the ground,

251
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,500
the wings rot away and the seed starts to germinate.

252
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,500
A new Alsomitra vine starts to grow up towards the canopy

253
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:06,200
and into the light - well away from its parent.

254
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,900
There are other ways to disperse seeds

255
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,000
and plants have evolved different tactics

256
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,200
depending on where they live.

257
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:25,000
In the desert of Arizona lives a master - the Saguaro cactus.

258
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:32,500
In the cool of the night, the cacti open their radiant flowers.

259
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:47,000
They're soon visited by nectar-feeding bats

260
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,600
and as the bats move from cactus to cactus,

261
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,200
they pollinate them.

262
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,400
Each flower only lasts a night,

263
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:20,200
but over three weeks, each cactus will produce more than 200 flowers.

264
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,600
Every pollinated flower immediately begins to form a fruit at its base,

265
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,500
packed with thousands of seeds.

266
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,200
The mature Saguaro cacti are superbly adapted

267
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,600
to survive out in the intense heat of the Sonoran Desert.

268
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:05,600
But their seeds are delicate, and must find shade or they will scorch to death before they germinate.

269
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,100
The seeds are covered with succulent sweet flesh -

270
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:13,400
a meal that all sorts of desert creatures find irresistible.

271
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:22,000
White winged doves are among the first to reach the ripening fruit.

272
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,100
The seeds survive in the birds' stomachs

273
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,300
and will be carried many miles

274
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:30,600
before being deposited in their droppings.

275
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,500
Their own little packet of fertiliser.

276
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,100
But the cactus doesn't just rely on birds.

277
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:43,900
Fallen fruit provides a bonanza for creatures on the ground.

278
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:51,500
Foraging ants quickly gather seeds and flesh.

279
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,800
That's if a tortoise doesn't get there first.

280
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:00,100
The greater range of animals the cactus can get to eat its fruit,

281
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:04,400
the more likely the seeds within will be carried to the perfect place to germinate.

282
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,700
The ants carry the seeds underground into their nests,

283
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,500
often excavated among the roots of trees.

284
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:19,000
The tortoise too will head for shade.

285
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
It spends much of its day cooling off under trees

286
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,400
where it's sure to leave undigested seeds in its dung.

287
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,800
Now the seeds wait for the rains to come.

288
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,300
THUNDER

289
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:50,600
Of the 40 million or so seeds a cactus produces in its lifetime,

290
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,300
the chances are that only one will develop into a plant

291
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,400
that outlives its parent.

292
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,600
If it was lucky enough to find shade,

293
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,800
a seed will still take ten years

294
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,700
to become a five centimetre tall cactus.

295
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:12,500
To reach the size of its parents, possibly ten metres,

296
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,400
will take at least 100 years.

297
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:25,000
Plants can survive in the most unlikely and inhospitable places on Earth.

298
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,200
Here on Socotra, a remote island in the Arabian Sea,

299
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,700
the dry season is brutal.

300
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:38,300
But this strange tree has a strategy to survive it.

301
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:46,600
The Dragon's Blood tree.

302
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:54,800
The key to their success lies in their bizarre shape.

303
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,500
They live on the mountain tops where there's little soil,

304
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,100
but there are critical compensations.

305
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,200
Occasional morning mists sweep across the high ground.

306
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:22,700
The mist condenses on the skyward-pointing waxy leaves.

307
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:33,600
The droplets run down to the centre of the trunk and down to its roots.

308
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:43,700
Water is so precious that the tree cannot afford to waste any.

309
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Drops that do escape and fall to the ground are not totally lost.

310
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:02,600
The tree's huge, densely packed crown acts as a parasol.

311
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:11,400
It shades the ground so effectively it allows time for the water to seep into the sand.

312
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,900
And it also shades the network of roots

313
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,100
that lie just under the surface.

314
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,200
Another plant shares this parched desert,

315
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,600
but survives in a very different way.

316
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,400
The Desert Rose.

317
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,300
In really harsh conditions,

318
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:42,600
it jettisons its leaves to minimise water loss.

319
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:47,900
Strangely, it chooses this time to flower.

320
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:53,100
Its bulbous trunk is like a barrel that stores water all year round.

321
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,700
It's so hardy it can grow out of bare rock.

322
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,500
It might seem that conditions can't get much tougher

323
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,900
for a plant than here.

324
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,500
But, for some, the conditions are even harsher.

325
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,700
Six hours ago, here on the coast of Australia,

326
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,800
this tree was high and dry on a sandy beach.

327
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,200
For almost all plants, saltwater is lethal,

328
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,700
so submersion of this tree's roots by the tide twice a day

329
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,800
should kill it.

330
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,300
Yet this Red Mangrove is flourishing.

331
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:59,600
The retreating tide reveals the key to surviving the sea's assault.

332
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,900
The mangrove's roots are covered in warty growths.

333
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:11,400
The growths surround pores that take in oxygen from the air

334
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,900
when the roots are above water.

335
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:25,500
But the pores become useful in a quite different way when they're submerged again.

336
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,400
They allow water into the plant,

337
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,100
but filter out 99% of the salt as it passes through.

338
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:47,800
Any salt that gets in is pumped into a few sacrificial leaves that turn yellow and are discarded.

339
00:37:55,300 --> 00:38:00,500
Plants can not only cope with being poisoned, parched and scorched,

340
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,500
but they can also survive being frozen.

341
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:06,100
In the world's northern forests,

342
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:10,400
the changing of the seasons creates its own challenges.

343
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,800
As summer moves to autumn,

344
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,800
plants prepare themselves for the toughest time of their year.

345
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:37,200
Broad-leaved trees unveil what seems to us a colourful spectacle.

346
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:44,100
But for these plants it is the beginning of a series of urgent and drastic survival strategies

347
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,300
to cope with the coming cold.

348
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:53,600
They begin by pulling all the water and nutrients within their leaves back into the trunk.

349
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:59,100
The last rays of useful sunlight are channelled

350
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,400
into making a sugary anti-freeze

351
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,200
that will protect the body of the tree.

352
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,200
The green pigment - chlorophyll -

353
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:15,100
disappears, leaving purples, reds, oranges and yellows.

354
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:19,800
Finally, the leaves die and the trees discard them.

355
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,000
As temperatures drop below freezing,

356
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
the plants of broad-leaved forests settle down

357
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,700
to hibernate until spring.

358
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:54,000
Pine trees can survive much colder conditions.

359
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,600
They have anti-freeze in the leaves themselves,

360
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,300
that means they can keep them all winter.

361
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,800
The needle-like leaves also have a thick waxy coating

362
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,600
that limits any water loss through pores.

363
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,500
The winters here are long and hard.

364
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:24,600
The trees have to survive temperatures of down to -40C for five months.

365
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:17,500
But one pine tree is capable of surviving even harsher conditions.

366
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,400
These pines live at the limit of life -

367
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:29,200
above 3,000 metres in the mountains of western America.

368
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:35,400
Almost continuous freezing temperatures and savage winds

369
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,600
make life so tough that these bristle cones

370
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:42,000
only manage to grow for six weeks of the year.

371
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,900
Everything is about conserving energy.

372
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:53,500
They hardly ever shed their needles, which can last more than 30 years.

373
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:57,400
After centuries of being blasted by storms,

374
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,100
a full-grown tree still survives

375
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:03,700
with only a strip of bark a few inches wide.

376
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:13,800
These trees live life at such a slow pace that they can reach great age.

377
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,500
Some are over 5,000 years old.

378
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,800
It's been said of the bristlecones,

379
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,700
that to live here is to take a very long time to die.

380
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,500
As the northern spring approaches,

381
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,600
the warming temperatures and increased day length

382
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,600
release the land from winter.

383
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:52,200
Plants that have lain dormant begin to grow again.

384
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:01,000
These have over-wintered,

385
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,600
buried in the mud at the bottom of this frozen lake.

386
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,400
The retreating ice allows the water to warm

387
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,400
and this white water lily to flourish for another season.

388
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,000
And, as all the trees come out of their winter rest,

389
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,600
the vivid green of new leaves returns to the land.

390
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:09,800
From the frozen north to the southern deserts,

391
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:13,600
the spring bloom symbolises the success of plants

392
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,100
in surviving against the odds.

393
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:45,600
But the most successful type of flowering plant

394
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:49,900
is one that makes up 20% of all plant life on the planet.

395
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,800
Grass.

396
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:58,400
There are 10,000 different species.

397
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:08,500
Today, they form the diet of many thousands of different animals.

398
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,900
And a few grasses, particularly rich in nutrients,

399
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:20,200
have developed a relationship with one animal

400
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,400
and together, the two have changed the world.

401
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:38,300
10,000 years ago, we humans started to cultivate rice

402
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:42,600
in order to harvest its food-rich seeds.

403
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,600
Now, half of the world's population depends on it.

404
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:05,800
But there is one other grass that has spread

405
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,000
even further across the planet

406
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
due to its relationship with humans...

407
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,800
wheat.

408
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:21,800
It underpinned the development of western civilisation.

409
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,200
Today, it covers more of the land than any other kind of plant.

410
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:47,500
Plants have been residents on land longer than animals

411
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,800
and have had nearly half a billion years to evolve.

412
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,200
During that time, they've diversified into countless forms

413
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,600
and have colonised every habitat.

414
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:13,000
As well as collaborating with animals,

415
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,500
plants are sometimes their masters,

416
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:18,200
exploiting them to their own advantage.

417
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:33,300
Plants capture energy from the sun

418
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:39,000
and all life on land, directly or indirectly, depends on them.

419
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:44,800
So, ultimately, plants fuel the diversity of life on Earth.

420
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:59,200
To see the behaviour of plants as they struggle to survive

421
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,300
presented a unique challenge.

422
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:10,500
The plants team had to employ many techniques,

423
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:14,600
including time-lapse and high-speed photography.

424
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,900
They filmed in jungles, deserts, swamps and plains,

425
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:26,300
but they also spent many hours shooting in a converted barn

426
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:27,800
just outside Exeter.

427
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,600
All under the watchful eye

428
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:45,300
of green-fingered cameraman Tim Shepherd.

429
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,300
Filming plants in time-lapse takes so long

430
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:56,000
and is so susceptible to changes in light levels and weather conditions

431
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,700
that some key sequences had to be filmed in this studio.

432
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:09,300
In time-lapse, a camera takes a series of pictures

433
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,500
over an extended period of time,

434
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:15,600
so, when played back, the action appears speeded up.

435
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:19,500
These sunflowers actually take three days to open,

436
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:22,700
but are seen opening in a matter of seconds.

437
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:31,800
The most complex time-lapse the team attempted

438
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:34,000
showed an entire growing season

439
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,200
in an English woodland in one continuous shot.

440
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,200
A shot that took two years to create.

441
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:49,600
I think this is going to be the spot.

442
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,900
As the producer Neil Lucas

443
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:57,800
leads Tim and Mick Connaire the graphic designer out to the location,

444
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,500
he explains his idea.

445
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:03,400
- Well, this is one that I thought...
- That's a lovely rock.
- Just here.

446
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:07,200
And I think that'd be great to have the brambles growing along.

447
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:11,000
It will be a tracking shot through the wood with plants growing,

448
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,100
flowers blooming and the woodland coming to life

449
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:16,800
over the course of a year.

450
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,700
We're condensing that one year down into less than a minute.

451
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:23,600
We're going to have to have them all coming out at the same time, multiple passes.

452
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:26,200
How long does a foxglove take to grow?

453
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:29,400
Well, if we start just before the buds are about to open

454
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,200
and you've got the whole long spike,

455
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,000
then top to bottom that's probably about three weeks.

456
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,400
So, even if you wanted to, you couldn't shoot the plants here

457
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:40,200
because, three weeks, the weather's going to change,

458
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:45,700
you've got the day-night and also just leaving the equipment here running, it's not feasible, is it?

459
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:49,600
You just have to imagine the changes that would happen here in three weeks

460
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:51,500
and if that was all joined together

461
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,600
and one frame the plant might be there

462
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:56,900
and you take a shot of it an hour later and, if the wind's blowing,

463
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:00,700
it's over here somewhere and then you join those two shots together...

464
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:05,600
It just won't work. So what we've got to do is not only have we got to produce a move

465
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,200
that is exactly the same repeatable move,

466
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:11,600
a track that can be built exactly the same again in a studio.

467
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:15,000
Build exact models of every object in here so we can put plants

468
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,500
in the right places and then time everything,

469
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:21,400
- so they grow just as the camera happens to be pointing at them.
- Yes.
- OK.

470
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:24,600
The scale of the challenge is dawning on them.

471
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,600
Months of planning lie ahead.

472
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,900
The following spring, the team head back to the wood.

473
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:34,700
With no road access,

474
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:39,300
manpower is the only way to get the tonnes of equipment into position.

475
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:50,900
Everyone's wondering how this will turn out, including the locals.

476
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,700
- Go up about an inch.
- Straight now.

477
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Start like that.

478
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,500
Position now is 221556.

479
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:19,200
We've done it wrong.

480
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
That's pulled it. Hang on - that's pulled it terribly.

481
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,200
BLEEP!

482
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,600
- Did that snap?
- No, it's pulled this wheel round.

483
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:45,000
Two days of building, levelling, test runs

484
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,300
and even a few minor disasters

485
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:50,300
and finally the track is ready to run.

486
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:53,400
OK, that's pretty close.

487
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:59,900
If you move your... Can you see that little bit of lichen? Go to 8,900.

488
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,500
Accuracy is paramount.

489
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,700
Yeah, whatever we shoot in the studio,

490
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:10,100
it's got to match this landscape exactly,

491
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:12,800
so unless we know precisely where everything is

492
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,200
relative to the camera,

493
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:18,100
there's no way of placing the plants in the studio in the right place.

494
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:20,400
So we have to measure the hell out of it.

495
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,500
Oh, bloody hell, it's spot on. Look at that.

496
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:27,400
- So 250.
- OK.

497
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,800
Shot by shot and step by step,

498
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:40,600
the camera inches its way back up the 30 metre track.

499
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,100
Well, that's working.

500
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,600
This is only the background shot.

501
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,700
There is still a huge amount of other filming to be done.

502
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:58,400
The track has to be rebuilt exactly as it is on location

503
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:02,200
back in the studio - a task that would take weeks to get right.

504
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:23,400
Right under the tree at the end of the rock.

505
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,700
Using the detailed measurements taken in the wood,

506
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:31,900
the position size and shape of every structure

507
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:33,600
has to be matched precisely.

508
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:40,600
- 35.
- 35, yeah.

509
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:49,300
The slightest discrepancy will put the team back to square one.

510
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:54,900
Chicken-wire and polystyrene form the rocks and trees of the woodland.

511
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:59,400
Blue screen is used to cover every inch of the set

512
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:04,000
to allow the original shot to be mapped on later in graphics.

513
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,700
Once built, and with the plants placed in their exact locations,

514
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:08,800
filming can start.

515
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:13,600
The stars of the show finally make an appearance.

516
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,700
Timing is everything.

517
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:37,600
With each plant taking up to three weeks to flower

518
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,300
there's only one chance of getting it right.

519
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:09,600
A year later and thankfully so far all had gone to plan.

520
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:21,200
The final stage is to bring all the pieces together seamlessly -

521
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:24,100
a challenging task for any graphic designer.

522
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:28,200
We've got things overlapping that wouldn't necessarily grow at the same time,

523
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:31,800
but all the growth of each individual plant is absolutely accurate.

524
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,500
It's exactly what they would do.

525
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:36,000
We're just seeing it in a shorter space of time.

526
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:41,100
That big rock in the foreground at the end of the shot that we wanted to try and get stuff climbing on,

527
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:43,000
that's worked really, really well.

528
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,700
This is the bramble here.

529
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:49,900
Had to measure it so carefully so we knew exactly where these things were, how round they were,

530
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:51,700
how deep they were from the camera.

531
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:53,900
Then when we take the blue out of that

532
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:56,700
you can see that the plants start to sit into the shot

533
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:58,600
exactly where we wanted them to be,

534
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:00,800
things appearing from behind the tree,

535
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:02,500
forming on the top of the rock.

536
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,400
- That's fantastic.
- So here they go.

537
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,500
If I switch those off

538
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:08,500
you can see how just how neatly they slot into the shot.

539
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:10,800
If we play it, you can see

540
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:15,200
that everything's sticking in pretty well.

541
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:24,500
96 layers, 15 tracks and two years later, the shot is finally complete.

542
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:32,200
A 60-second shot that proved to be one of the most complex

543
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:35,400
ever attempted in natural history film-making.
