1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,080
Love is a four letter word.

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,720
Wait a minute, so is lust.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,760
So are hate and loss.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,400
So is fate.

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,480
But you know what...

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,520
So is L.I.F.E!

7
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,120
My husband and I were in Nagpur.

8
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,560
His brother-in-law had a heart attack.

9
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,280
On the morning of October 12,
my husband left for the hospital...

10
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,200
but he never made it.

11
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,160
The police called at about
one in the morning

12
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,120
and informed me that they had
found his body on the railway tracks.

13
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,160
And now the media claims that
he committed suicide.

14
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,560
My husband was looking forward
to his retirement.

15
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,720
He promised me that we'd go on
a world tour together.

16
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:34,280
How can a man who is so happy and content
suddenly commit suicide?

17
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,560
Tell me.

18
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,640
Chianti?

19
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,320
You ordered the same thing
when we met for the first time.

20
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,680
You remember?

21
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,040
I remember everything.

22
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,840
Like it was yesterday.

23
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,960
-Is it hot?
-Yes, be careful.

24
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,920
That's delicious.

25
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,360
By the way, I can do this every day.

26
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,520
What?
Eat pasta?

27
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,880
No. Cook for you.

28
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,560
With you.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,040
Cheers to that.

30
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,160
Dee... I think Arjun is
turning into my mom.

31
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,000
Did he ask you to oil your hair?

32
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,880
No! He wants to cook for me every day.

33
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,240
Do you think he wants
to move in with me?

34
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,720
He can't.
Arya will be traumatized.

35
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,160
Can I make dinner for you tomorrow?

36
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,080
Sorry, what?

37
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,320
You know that Julia Child book
I picked up from Paris last time.

38
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,320
Your dinner for tomorrow...
Coq Au vin!

39
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,440
Maybe you should learn to
make an egg first.

40
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,440
Bye.

41
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,520
Anj?

42
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,880
I have eaten a lot of food!
This is so good.

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,720
What... are you doing?

44
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,600
You take care of everyone.

45
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,040
You should let others take care
of you as well.

46
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,200
Dee, Arjun is turning into my father now.

47
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,720
He wants to take care of me.

48
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,480
What do you mean?
When you fall ill?

49
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,640
No. All the time.
Like I'm some damsel in distress.

50
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,320
I'm coming over
to turn Arjun into a feminist.

51
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,760
You know what, I'll tutor him on
Simone de Beauvoir for a full hour

52
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,440
-and he'll never waver again.
-Anjana.

53
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,040
Coming! Two minutes, Arjun.

54
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,640
Anj! One second, I'm com--

55
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,080
Anj!

56
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,320
We are in sync even at this sink.

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,920
Sorry?

58
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,000
Even when we are doing the dishes...

59
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,200
it's like we're making love!

60
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,360
Dee, Arjun is turning into Radha now.

61
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,400
Since when has washing dishes together
become the new relationship goal?

62
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,680
Should I come over to
clean your dishes?

63
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,840
I'm very good at washing dishes, Anj.

64
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,960
You know...

65
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,160
-I'll do the dishes.
-Dee, one second.

66
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,080
You want to come over to
wash my dishes?

67
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,200
Seriously?

68
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,880
You have to work.
You have a deadline.

69
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,120
No, Anj, I'll be very good at it.
Anj!

70
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,640
Damn!

71
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,560
Stop judging me
you inanimate piece of shit!

72
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,560
-Samara.
-Samara.

73
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,800
We're outside Mumbai's most
renowned psychiatrist's clinic.

74
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,040
-Samara, do you have a mental problem?
-Let me go!

75
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,320
-What happened to your MMA film?
-Let me go!

76
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,920
Fuck off!
What do you want?

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,240
Oh, my God!

78
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,480
-Are you a drug addict?
-What do you want?

79
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,640
-What do you want?
-Are you a lesbian?

80
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,360
Give us an answer!

81
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,240
What's up?

82
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,120
Hey! Thanks.

83
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,160
No problem.

84
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,680
Yeah. Okay.

85
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,600
-Who died?
-What?

86
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,320
-What?
-What were you all watching?

87
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,800
You guys are hiding something.

88
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,680
-What is it?
-Mangs...

89
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,720
There's a video.
Maybe you should see it.

90
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,920
-Are you a lesbian?
-What do you want?

91
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,080
-Samara.
-Samara.

92
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,240
What are you doing outside
a psychiatrist's clinic?

93
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,920
-Samara, do you have mental problems?
-Let me go!

94
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,000
Your MMA film is complete
but hasn't been released yet.

95
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,200
-What do you want?
-Are you a drug addict?

96
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,040
-What do you want?
-Are you a lesbian?

97
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,800
-We want an answer!
-Fuck off!

98
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,520
Are you in need of a psychiatrist?

99
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,000
-She's mad!
-Yes!

100
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,800
-I'm fucking crazy!
-She's mad!

101
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,880
I am fucking crazy!

102
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,480
-She is mad!
-What is she doing!

103
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,720
-What is she doing? She's mad!
-She's lost it!

104
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,640
I'm crazy!

105
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,160
-What is she doing?
-She deserves that.

106
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,480
-Her career is over!
-Fuck off!

107
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,720
-She's over!
-You're finished!

108
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,600
You're finished!

109
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,840
-Mangs! Mangs, please talk to us.
-Mangs, please don't go.

110
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,920
Mangs!

111
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,720
Maybe we should go to
her house or something.

112
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,840
What the hell did you say to Umang?
She looked so upset.

113
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,480
And you're questioning me because?

114
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,280
Not just you.
I'm asking all of you.

115
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,360
I'm not a bitch, you know.

116
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,320
-I never said that, Damini.
-You definitely make me feel like one.

117
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,480
Look... I'm sorry.

118
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,720
Come on guys, let's go.

119
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,080
Samara, do you have mental problems?

120
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,480
-Fuck off!
-Are you in need of a psychiatrist?

121
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,640
She's mad! She's mad!

122
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,440
-She's mad!
-Yes! I'm fucking crazy!

123
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,080
-She's mad!
-I'm crazy!

124
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,360
-I'm fucking crazy!
-She's mad!

125
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,600
Get her out of here!

126
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,640
Good morning, everyone.

127
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,560
For all those who don't know me,
my name is Vinil Verma.

128
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,240
I've been heading the Delhi office
for ten years.

129
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,240
Since Ratan has moved to Singapore...

130
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,760
I'm your new managing partner.

131
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,560
I'm really happy to be leading
this striking team of lawyers

132
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,920
that I hope to get to know
on a personal level soon.

133
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,560
There will be a few changes going forward.

134
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,160
You have the list of your
new case files in front of you.

135
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,800
Please go through them
before the Monday meeting.

136
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,720
Billable hours.
Lots of billable hours.

137
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,040
Vinil, I'm sorry but these
are standard real estate cases.

138
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,760
I handle corporate cases
and litigation for giants

139
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,680
like Titus Tech and Invictor Steel.

140
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,120
Owing to RERA, we now have
lots real estate cases.

141
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,200
And they require so much diligence.

142
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,440
And women are such diligent workhorses.

143
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,360
Workhorses?

144
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,880
That's a compliment.

145
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,960
Men tend to overlook the finer points.

146
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,400
Vinil, I am an advocate and I don't...

147
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,560
appreciate my experience
and skills being underutilized.

148
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,240
Teamwork makes the dream work, Anjana.

149
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,000
That's all for now. Thank you, everyone.
Let's regroup after lunch.

150
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,000
Vikram, I would like you
to have a look at these files.

151
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,720
Shristi.

152
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,720
Do you still you have your IP cases?

153
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,560
Trademark registration only.

154
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,960
All my cases have been
given to Shimit and Sameer.

155
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,280
And your cases have been
given to Vikram and Murad.

156
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,480
I love this.

157
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,400
Arjun, this is a terrible movie.

158
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,000
No, this moment. This...

159
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,680
domestic bliss.

160
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,360
You and me?

161
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,400
We don't need to do anything special
to feel special.

162
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,320
It makes me dream about our future.

163
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,120
You know?

164
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,160
Perfect evenings, cooking together.

165
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,640
Telling each other
about each other's day.

166
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,640
Arya with her little brother
or sister.

167
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,640
Watching cartoons together.

168
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,880
It's magical, isn't it?

169
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,320
Yeah.

170
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,160
Anjana?

171
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,080
-Yeah.
-All okay, babe?

172
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,600
Yeah, all okay.

173
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,280
You've been in there
for quite some time.

174
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,640
-You sure you don't need anything?
-No, I'm good.

175
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,160
Just give me two minutes.

176
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,480
Condom?

177
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,640
Not yet.

178
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,880
Okay.

179
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,760
Now?

180
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,440
Not ready yet.

181
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,640
Should we?

182
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,520
Arjun, condom!

183
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,120
Okay.

184
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,160
Arjun, stop... stop... stop!

185
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,400
-What?
-I think I heard a rip.

186
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,080
No, there's no rip.

187
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,600
No, I did. I did. I heard a rip.
Just check please.

188
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,640
Fuck!

189
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,360
I lost it.

190
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,880
It's gone.

191
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,760
-Hi!
-Hi.

192
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,880
Mama, I made a monkey mask
with Aunt Pookie, see.

193
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,760
That's amazing, my little monkey.

194
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,720
-Hi.
-Hi.

195
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,040
Sorry, I got a little delayed.
The traffic is insane.

196
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,000
That's all right.
We had a good time, right?

197
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,520
The good thing about traffic
is that you can't rush.

198
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,760
Not again, Varun.

199
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,240
You're a lawyer. I'm sure you know that
driving without a license is a crime.

200
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,120
That's why I took a cab.

201
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,440
Good idea.

202
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,600
Did the cabbie have a license?

203
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,760
No, Varun.
He was driving on his PAN.

204
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,320
Anything's possible with you.

205
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,640
Says the most irresponsible
man in the world!

206
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,880
Am I irresponsible?

207
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,880
I am the one who drove
drunk with my child in the car.

208
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,720
Okay.
Enough you two.

209
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,120
Bye, monkey.

210
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,640
Arya, come here.

211
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,360
I love you very much.

212
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,120
Come baby, let's go.

213
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,520
Mama, why are you and Papa angry?

214
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,240
No, baby. We're not angry.

215
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Then, why do you two shout at each other?

216
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,240
My best friend, Lara also
has two mamas and two papas.

217
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,280
They all went to London
zoo and saw baby penguins.

218
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,640
I am sorry, baby.
Come here.

219
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,520
It won't happen again.
I promise.

220
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,440
I will not fight with your papa.
I promise.

221
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,760
We will also go to the London zoo.

222
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,200
Yes!

223
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,160
Mama, Papa, me and Aunt Pookie.

224
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,520
Let's take Arjun along.
He's a nice boy.

225
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,520
Okay, we'll all go to the London zoo.

226
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,360
What do you want to see there?

227
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,360
-Zebra.
-What else?

228
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,000
I want to see a lion.

229
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,000
You made Arjun lose his erection?

230
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,400
Cruella Menon.

231
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,000
Guys, I couldn't help it.

232
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,320
I was freaked out!

233
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,400
Arjun wants a home, a family and
Arya's fond of him as well.

234
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,440
This is great, right?

235
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,120
But, why do I panic when he talks
about the second child?

236
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,480
My first marriage didn't work out well

237
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,960
but that doesn't mean that
the next one won't work as well,

238
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,040
-Yes!
-Yes!

239
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,680
Maybe I don't have a problem with the
second marriage but having a second child.

240
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,440
I can't bear the thought
of water retention,

241
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:20,120
nappy changing,
my vagina becoming a whale again!

242
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,280
-Yes!
-Yes!

243
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,520
Or maybe the real issue is that...

244
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,400
Varun and I haven't had closure yet.

245
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,840
There is still a lot of
unresolved hostility between us.

246
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,680
Especially after that accident.

247
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,280
-Yes!
-Yes!

248
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,240
Does it sound like I'm reciting
Baa Baa Black Sheep to you,

249
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,800
that you keep saying "Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!" like a broken record?

250
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,960
-Yes!
-Yes!

251
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:46,000
Anj, relax! We're just glad that
you're finally acknowledging all this.

252
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,400
And, this explains
your past obsession with Kavya.

253
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,200
I don't have any obsession
with Kavya. Please!

254
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,720
Not anymore.
But you did.

255
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,560
Guys, I used to be the
most sorted one.

256
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,280
Ladies! Time for some shots!
Let's live it up!

257
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,360
Let's go!

258
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,440
Shots!

259
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,920
Don't you want it?
This is for you.

260
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,760
Shots!
Shots!

261
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,960
Come on, guys! Hydration! Shots!

262
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,800
She is in complete denial.

263
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,240
That's fine, Dee.

264
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,880
Everyone has their own way
of dealing with problems.

265
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,760
True.

266
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,080
Yes, but shutting down emotionally
can't be good for you.

267
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,760
-My hair is so sticky these days.
-Guys, I've started chumming.

268
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,880
Do you have a pad?

269
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,640
-I don't have it.
-Wait.

270
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,520
-Yeah! Here you go.
-Lend me one, please.

271
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,200
You're giving me a tampon.
I've never used one.

272
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,240
-What?
-What?

273
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,560
I was a virgin till recently, remember?

274
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,480
So?

275
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,240
Siddhi, please don't tell me
that you think

276
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,400
a tampon can make you lose your virginity.

277
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,120
Siddhu, listen carefully.

278
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:06,480
You can lose your virginity only to sex.
Not a tampon. Got it?

279
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,120
I hate you guys.

280
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,960
Shots! Shots! Shots!

281
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,720
-Everybody!
-Mangs, stop it.

282
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,480
That's enough.
Just calm down.

283
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,360
If you're slow,
then you lose the flow. Okay?

284
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,400
-Okay.
-Shots for everybody.

285
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,440
Why are you so slow?
What happened?

286
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,840
I have a cucumber up me.

287
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,000
What?

288
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,360
I am wearing a tampon
for the first time.

289
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,640
It feels really weird to
have something shoved up.

290
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,240
You didn't seem to have a problem with
the Turkish delight.

291
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,480
Are you always obnoxious?

292
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,520
Or only when you can't
cope with your problems?

293
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,040
Sorry.

294
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,440
Sids, I'm sorry.

295
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,680
I am sorry. I love you.

296
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,360
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

297
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,320
-I love you.
-I'm sorry.

298
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,920
At least your jokes aren't
as bad as Viju's.

299
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,920
What's going on between
the two of you?

300
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,920
Don't even ask me about it.
It's horrible!

301
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,800
I am exhausted trying to
convince him that

302
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,360
I can also do something with my life.

303
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,000
This is the palette that I am using.

304
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,360
These are the two colors I'm going
to be using right now.

305
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,080
If you had pursued commerce
instead of arts in college...

306
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,640
I believe everything would
have been different.

307
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,960
Honestly, I'm running out of ideas now.

308
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,560
Siddhi.

309
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,480
Let's make a list of your skills.

310
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,240
-Yeah.
-That will help us.

311
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,520
Let's do it.

312
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,800
-Okay.
-So...

313
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,720
Siddhi's skills.

314
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,280
-Sweet.
-Sweet!

315
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,880
-Yes.
-She is very sweet.

316
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,360
-Cute.
-So cute.

317
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,120
Bubbly.

318
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,240
Bubbly?

319
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,120
Is that a skill or a champagne?

320
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:22,880
Adorable?

321
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,960
Thanks!
I really needed this pep talk.

322
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,240
-Thank you so much!
-Sids.

323
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,280
-Sids, we love you.
-You could be a princess at kid's parties.

324
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,240
-Yeah!
-Or a mascot at an amusement park

325
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,320
like Appu Ghar, Nicco Park!

326
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,000
Okay, now honestly tell me...

327
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,280
how many of you over here have had the

328
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,760
sex awkward conversation
with your parents?

329
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,560
-Not me.
-No way!

330
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,120
Not even one person?

331
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,720
-No.
-Are you mad?

332
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,640
What?

333
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,520
We're a population of...

334
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,800
1.33 billion! We are around
33 crore people in this country...

335
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,160
and none of our parents have had
that conversation with us, right?

336
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,960
-No!
-It's so weird.

337
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,640
Even our scientists say that the Kauravas
were test tube babies.

338
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,320
And we're the outcome of
binary fission.

339
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,560
I mean, porn is the first access.

340
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,080
Excuse me!
Ma'am! I am talking to you!

341
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,480
There's a show going on over here.

342
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,240
What happened?
You seem angry.

343
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,320
Did you just break up with
your boyfriend?

344
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:31,560
Just because I am a girl, you feel that
a guy can be the reason for my anger!

345
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,200
I mean, clearly you're angry.
I think you should vent it out.

346
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,440
And if you don't want to...

347
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,800
then you can go for a run or do something
till you feel better.

348
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,200
Let it out.

349
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,920
I think because every time they say gym,
you probably hear gin.

350
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,320
Do you want this?
Because I really think you need one!

351
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,800
What happened?

352
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,440
You ranked last in your IIT exams?

353
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,320
Then, you tried to write a book
on your pathetic love story.

354
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,320
That didn't work, so you finally
became a comedian.

355
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,080
Meow! Your claws are out!

356
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,680
Yeah! It's because unlike you,
I just got a manicure.

357
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,560
It's clear that something's bothering you.

358
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,800
Why don't you just
let it out and tell all of us?

359
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,200
-You can trust us, right?
-Yeah!

360
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,080
What's going on? What's up?
What's bothering you?

361
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:29,280
Tell us! Tell us! Tell us!

362
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,960
I really think I should've
had a typical local name.

363
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,760
Like Hormonal Patel.

364
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,800
I'm so fucking hormonal!

365
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,160
And I would like to address all the men
in the audience that this is not a joke.

366
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,480
A girl's mind is like
an amusement park.

367
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,240
It's where there's a mood swing available
every thirty minutes.

368
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,160
And despite that, we can multitask!

369
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,040
We go to work.
We raise kids.

370
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,560
We run for Prime Minister.

371
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,200
-Yeah!
-And...

372
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,040
And in case
you haven't already figured out...

373
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,240
News Flash! I got down today.

374
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,440
I just don't understand this concept.

375
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,320
Am I a railway signal
that goes up or down?

376
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:14,080
I tried wearing a tampon today
for the first time in my life!

377
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,800
And to be honest,
it was really confusing!

378
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,080
I mean, did you know that we women
have three holes down there?

379
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,280
Three holes!

380
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,800
Are we human beings or
are we a golf course?

381
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,680
So, here I am, a 24-year-old girl
with a tampon inside her!

382
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,760
I don't have a job or a boyfriend and...

383
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,480
No! Oh, well...
I met a really awesome guy

384
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,680
with great abs and a great, great brain.
But, I let him go.

385
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,920
Why?
Because I wanted to discover myself.

386
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,040
I am a self-declared
Wanderlust Queen, right?

387
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:47,720
And... to top it all, my dad
who used to be my best friend

388
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,480
is not even talking to me anymore.

389
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,320
And my mom who used to
hate me, is now my new best friend!

390
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,280
Here are my real best friends!

391
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,320
They think I should be a mascot
in an amusement park.

392
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,440
Right.

393
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,880
And all I can think of is that
gin and tonic has 90 calories

394
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,680
and vodka and tonic has 110.

395
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,040
Should I have one large
vodka or two small gins?

396
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,960
Because my dear audience, there
isn't enough alcohol in the world

397
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,560
for me to drown my sorrows in.

398
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,400
So... here's to gin, wine,
vodka, and beer.

399
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,960
Bring on the bloody mood swings.

400
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,000
-Siddhi, oh, my God.
-Sids, we should have this more often.

401
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,080
You never listen to us.

402
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,920
I always knew that
there's a raging fire in Sids.

403
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,440
Hormonal Patel.

404
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,720
You ruined my show over there.

405
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,520
Yeah! Wrong girl, wrong place, wrong time.

406
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,320
Shouldn't you be working on
your timing

407
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,800
if you want to be a stand-up comic?

408
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,400
Are you serious?

409
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,320
Yeah!

410
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,640
That's how boys are!

411
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,320
The world is full of boys.
Where are all the men?

412
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,520
When a girl takes the center stage...

413
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,400
the men panic!

414
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,440
Let it be!
I have always been a star.

415
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,280
Undoubtedly. The biggest star of them all.

416
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,920
I agree. You're the best.

417
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,200
Yeah! Even I think the same.

418
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,720
When you stop focusing on your pain,
it hurts less.

419
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,960
It's a good advice for both of us.

420
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,800
Hi, is everything all right?
Is Arya okay?

421
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,720
Arya's fine.

422
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,560
Listen, can you come over?

423
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,960
I think we should talk.

424
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,680
-Hey.
-Hi.

425
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,800
Here's some Chinese food...

426
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,320
and beer.

427
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,200
So, did you write anything?

428
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,880
Something came up.

429
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,400
It must have been extremely important.

430
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,480
It was important!

431
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,960
The bathroom's a mess.

432
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,560
The maid doesn't clean it properly.

433
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,040
There's hair everywhere.

434
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,080
What do I do?
I had to clean the whole loo.

435
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,640
You think I have a hormone issue?

436
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,720
Maybe I should get a full
blood profiling done.

437
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,720
Don't you think?

438
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,800
And look at this.
I tried!

439
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,760
Nothing.

440
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,960
I haven't been able to write
a single word.

441
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,080
What do I do?

442
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,960
I keep thinking about the Investigator and
what they did to me...

443
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,640
Show me your hands.

444
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,200
-Show me your hands.
-No, they're dirty.

445
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,600
-Don't, Aamir!
-Terrible.

446
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,600
-Yeah.
-But listen to me.

447
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,440
No more negative thoughts this evening.

448
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,840
Just relax.

449
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:26,960
All right?

450
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,720
Don't touch my face with that hand.

451
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,160
-Relax.
-What do you want to talk about?

452
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:33,920
Anj?

453
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,280
When are you marrying that child?

454
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,880
Please take your shoes off.

455
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,920
Is there something to eat?
I'm starving.

456
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,240
You can ask nicely.
Why are you being an asshole?

457
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,240
I am just meeting your expectations.

458
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,400
Varun... we need to fix this.

459
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,160
Are you talking about the food situation?

460
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,200
This... I am talking about us!

461
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,000
This constant bickering and sarcasm.

462
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,200
Arya's grown up now.
She understands everything.

463
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,400
I know it all started because of me...

464
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,440
but you can you put an end to it.

465
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,560
I just don't know how
we did we end up here.

466
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,720
I don't know.

467
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,320
Even I don't know.

468
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,760
All I know is I miss you, Anj.

469
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,360
I miss my best friend.

470
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,360
If not the best of friends,
we can still be friends.

471
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,800
For Arya's sake.

472
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,360
For all our sake.

473
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,480
So, how do we do this?

474
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,760
Why are you angry at me?

475
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,680
Because you put our
child's life in danger.

476
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,800
I know that.
Besides that?

477
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,400
Just say it.

478
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,120
I...

479
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,000
I feel you gave up on us too easily.

480
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,640
Did I give up?

481
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,640
You never fought for me, Varun.

482
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,200
So, what makes you angry?

483
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,080
It seems like...

484
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,880
we...

485
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,080
never existed.

486
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,200
You've forgotten us.

487
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,880
I don't know how you can say that
so easily.

488
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,520
What we had was special, Anjana.

489
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,640
It's very hot.

490
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,600
I know it was my fault and not yours.

491
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,480
I destroyed it.
Me!

492
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,600
I broke us.

493
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,440
Do you like it?

494
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,040
Did you learn this
while studying medicine?

495
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,320
I learnt it from my mother.

496
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,200
She used to force me to
massage her feet.

497
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,400
It's so strange. I never associated
you with having a mother, you know.

498
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,040
I mean, obviously,
I know you have a mother.

499
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,680
You're not an immaculate conception but...

500
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,120
you never talk about your family.

501
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,720
It almost feels like...
you just live in the moment.

502
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,320
In this very moment.

503
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,720
Share something about yourself.

504
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,840
Tell me.

505
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,400
What?
Where did you grow up?

506
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,400
Navy brat.
Grew up everywhere.

507
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,520
Siblings?

508
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,040
Three elder sisters.
Surrounded by women.

509
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,960
But my mad mother ruled over us.

510
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,240
She would dance with us
in the rains.

511
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,120
Sometimes we had just
ice cream for dinner.

512
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,080
We used to make forts out
of her saris in the living room

513
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,000
and play hide-and-seek.

514
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,000
That sounds amazing.

515
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,400
Where is she now?

516
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,000
She is dead.

517
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,800
She died of cervical cancer...

518
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,520
when I was 15 years old.

519
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,960
That's when I decided to
be a gynecologist.

520
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,360
Samara.

521
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,600
Samara.

522
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,440
It's me.
Please open the door.

523
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,400
I just need to speak to you.

524
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:17,960
Sam?

525
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,520
Fine.
Don't open the door.

526
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,440
You will open the door someday.

527
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,160
I'll wait here till then.

528
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,760
Varun...

529
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,920
I'm not an unfit mother.

530
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,120
-Why did you say that?
-I'm so sorry I said that.

531
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,680
You are an amazing mother.

532
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,400
It was just that I was angry

533
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,680
as you always lectured me
on responsibility.

534
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,920
But you ended up doing this.

535
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,200
I know.

536
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,560
She was burning up and you panicked.
I get it.

537
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,280
Actually, I should have been there.

538
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,560
And I guess as parents
we make these decisions

539
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,320
with our heart and not our head.

540
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,720
You know?

541
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:19,960
And that's what I did.

542
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,800
That's why I threatened to
take her away from you.

543
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,400
I just want to make sure you're okay.

544
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,160
I'll leave.

545
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,520
I'm fine.

546
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,600
Sam, I know when you lie.

547
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,720
Look... Umang, I don't want you
to worry about me.

548
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,400
But why?

549
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,040
Because I don't deserve it.

550
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,000
I am selfish and horrible.

551
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,200
No, you're not, Sam.
Please, just open the door.

552
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,960
I don't want you to see me like this.

553
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,600
I'm broken.

554
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,600
Sam, love can fix everything.

555
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,120
Samara, I loved you.
And I still love you.

556
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,720
I can't stop thinking about you.
I miss you so much.

557
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,360
I miss you I wake up,
when I go to bed...

558
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,440
at the gym and even when I brush my teeth.

559
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,320
I just can't get you out of my head.

560
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,640
Stop it, Umang.

561
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,000
Why?

562
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,480
It hurts too much to listen.

563
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,280
Is it because you don't feel the same?

564
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,760
It's because that's exactly how I feel.

565
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,800
I never thought I'd say this to you but...

566
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,320
you're a very good father.

567
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,760
Very good father and a
very bad husband.

568
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,200
It took me four years
to make love to someone else.

569
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,640
You were my first love.

570
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,360
Just saying.

571
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,040
Was it easy for me?

572
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,360
I was dating women one after the other.

573
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,800
Just trying to forget you.

574
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,680
I still jerked off thinking
about you after our divorce

575
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,880
for the longest time.

576
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,760
What?

577
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:04,240
I don't know if that's a compliment.

578
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,560
It's a compliment.
A huge compliment in fact.

579
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,280
Thanks, onion breath.

580
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,080
Snotty nose.

581
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,800
Varun, Arya has learned this from you.

582
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,000
She sticks boogers under the chair.

583
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,640
Yuck!

584
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,160
I'm sure Radha is really pissed
with me about that.

585
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,800
I bet she threw a party the day you
threw me out of the house.

586
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,560
Listen, I didn't throw you out.

587
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,480
You didn't stop me either.

588
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,000
Would you stay back?

589
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,520
Maybe not at that time.

590
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,280
I was hurt, angry, humiliated...

591
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,920
all of the above.

592
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,400
But I really thought...

593
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,480
that you'd call me back.

594
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,000
Do you think we could have made it?

595
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,040
I guess we'll never know now, will we?

596
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,480
I'm sorry, Umang.
I'm a fucking coward.

597
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,040
I love you.

598
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:07,920
Still?

599
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,880
Always and forever.

600
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,280
Can you feel me?

601
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,560
Yes.

602
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,880
Do you trust me?

603
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,040
Yes.

604
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,560
Do you love me?

605
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,840
Yes.

606
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,840
Then open the door, Samara.

607
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,800
Sam?

608
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,200
Just like old times...

609
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,880
I miss this.

610
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,120
So do I.

611
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,440
Friends?

612
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,600
Friends.

613
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,280
I think that's Radha.

614
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,840
-Hey, Anj.
-Yes.

615
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,200
You will always be my first love.

616
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,800
Not just your first love.
Your most epic love!

617
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,080
Come in.

618
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,000
Good morning, Radha.

619
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,360
How are you?

620
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,640
I was fine until now.

621
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,680
But I am not after seeing you.

622
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,840
I am a great man.

623
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,040
The ladies love me.

624
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,680
The ladies love you!
