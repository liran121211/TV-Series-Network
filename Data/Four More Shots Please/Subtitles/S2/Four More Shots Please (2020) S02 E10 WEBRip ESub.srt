1
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,840
Love letters, love poems and
love songs.

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,640
They all urge us to find "The One".

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,640
But maybe we are "The One".

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,000
And we should learn to love
ourselves first.

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,000
I knew it.

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,480
-You asshole.
-Relax, Sushmita. We...

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,560
We were just talking.

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,560
-Relax?
-We were discussing work.

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,000
You fucking relax!

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,200
I'm not blind.
I can fucking see you!

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,600
The music was loud in there.

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,520
We just came outside to
talk about the Titus Tech case.

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,680
That's all we were doing.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,760
You really think I'm that stupid?

15
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,360
You really think that I'm going to
fall for that bullshit?

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,200
I've been watching the two of you
since the morning.

17
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,240
-It's so obvious.
-It's not what you think.

18
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,640
You're imagining things. It's not at
all like you're assuming it to be.

19
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,160
There's nothing like that.
There's nothing going on.

20
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,600
Oh, my God.

21
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,600
Wow.

22
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,040
You're shameless.

23
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,680
This is my friend's wedding
for fuck sake!

24
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,160
You dare to humiliate me here?

25
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,960
Running around with
your fucking mistress!

26
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,560
Like some horny teenager.

27
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,840
-That's not what's happening.
-I'm sure

28
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,760
you two have done it all over this hotel.

29
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,640
That's not--

30
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,800
You need to get the fuck away
from me right now.

31
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,920
-Sushmita...
-Right now!

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,720
Sushmita. I'm sorry, I didn't know.

33
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,080
He said you guys are in
an open marriage.

34
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,480
Oh. Did he? Really?

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,600
What else did your
little boyfriend tell you?

36
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,240
And what exactly is an open marriage?

37
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,760
Go on.

38
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,360
That's what I thought.

39
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,840
And I'm talking to my husband.

40
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,960
So do you mind shutting
the fuck up, please?

41
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,400
-Hey! Please, relax!
-Get your fucking hands off me!

42
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,960
Calm down. You're going to create
a scene otherwise.

43
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,240
-Create...
-You want to create a scene here?

44
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,920
-I'm making a scene!
-At your friend's wedding?

45
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,120
I'm making a scene!

46
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,800
-Fifteen years, Shashank!
-No, it's not--

47
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,720
Fifteen fucking years we've been married!

48
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,720
Fifteen years and you dare to
treat me this way!

49
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,160
God. You can't keep it
in your pants for even a second!

50
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,040
Jesus!

51
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,480
You want to do this?

52
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,160
-Do what?
-Is this what you want to do?

53
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,880
Discuss your life in
front of the whole world?

54
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,440
-Ya. Let's do it.
-You really want to do this right now?

55
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,280
Let's do it! Please tell me
what we're talking about right now.

56
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,080
Because the only person
doing anything right now is you!

57
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,160
And her!

58
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,040
Fifteen years of a marriage.

59
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,600
Where have you been
for the last few years?

60
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,360
This relationship has
been falling apart for years.

61
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,520
We share a home.

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,800
We share a life,
we share a bed...

63
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,680
but you were never there
in this relationship.

64
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,600
You never fucking showed up!
That's your fucking problem!

65
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,600
-This is my fucking fault now?
-You never showed up!

66
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,600
Are you kidding me?

67
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,760
Every marriage has its problems.
So what?

68
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,880
That gives you free reign to
go fuck whoever the fuck you want?

69
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,880
Despite our problems,
I come back home to you.

70
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
-I come back to you.
-Oh, my God!

71
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,240
-Sush, let's just talk about this.
-Get the fuck away from me!

72
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,720
-Scream away.
-Oh, my God. Sush...

73
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,080
Do that.

74
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,520
-I deserve better than you...
-You feeling better?

75
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,040
you piece of shit!

76
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,440
-What's going on?
-Hey, hey...

77
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,400
What's going on is that
this guy... My husband...

78
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,840
is fucking her.

79
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,280
I'm sure you can work this out people.

80
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,320
What the fuck have you done?

81
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,840
Just talk to her.

82
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,480
Stay here.

83
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,840
Sush...

84
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,920
I believed you.

85
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,520
Don't get all sanctimonious
on me, Ms. Menon.

86
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,880
Don't dump your guilt at my door.

87
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,200
Had you known,

88
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,000
would you have done things differently?

89
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,000
-Shashank, please.
-I'm leaving, I'm leaving.

90
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,440
Anj, are you okay?

91
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,080
I...

92
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,240
I can't think straight.

93
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,360
He would take calls from his wife.
He would stay late.

94
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,760
He never looked worried.

95
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:00,800
I never suspected
it's not an open marriage.

96
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,040
Open marriage or not,
he is married.

97
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,640
It's just a very big grey area.

98
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,600
Ya but the lawyer in me is
always going to try and justify it, Mangs.

99
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,920
Consensual VS non-consensual.

100
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,120
Am I a willing participant or not?

101
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,360
-Simple.
-No, not really.

102
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,360
It's not so simple, Anj.

103
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:29,360
Dee, I'm not... I'm not trying to
absolve myself of anything.

104
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,680
I...

105
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,280
I hurt another woman.

106
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,760
I destroyed their marriage.
I know.

107
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,800
No, Anj. They have destroyed
their own marriage.

108
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,880
Let's be honest. If not you,
it would've been someone else.

109
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,000
Anj, next time when we tell you
this is not you...

110
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,040
listen to us.

111
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,120
Ya.

112
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Anj.

113
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,920
Mangs, I'm so sorry.

114
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,320
All this drama has ruined
your wedding.

115
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,320
Are you crazy?

116
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,040
What's a marriage without drama!

117
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,840
For the first time in my life,
I don't know who I am.

118
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:27,600
Marriage, kids, career, investments,
house, car... I've done it all.

119
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,040
Or should I say I had to?

120
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,680
I was just thrust into all of this
in my twenties.

121
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,720
And now should I live my thirties
like they're my twenties?

122
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,440
Or should I enjoy my thirties because
I've already done the hard work?

123
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,640
I just don't know who I am.

124
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,320
I told Mihir to move on.

125
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,560
What?

126
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,160
Damn. That's harsh.

127
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,040
I didn't want it to be.

128
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,560
But I didn't have closure
till I saw him here.

129
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,760
It's okay.

130
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,400
He must be cursing the
hell out of me.

131
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,320
He came all the way from New York,
only to get rejected.

132
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,160
Second time.

133
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,160
Hey, bride to be.

134
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,520
Hello, bride of the bride.

135
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,760
I can't believe we're
getting married tomorrow.

136
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,760
You better believe it

137
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,200
because beginning tomorrow
I'm going to make your life hell.

138
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,240
Really?

139
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,400
-Really?
-Yes.

140
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,840
-Baby...
-Yes?

141
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,080
I want us to do an
interview together.

142
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,080
Live streaming with Vanya Bhatt.

143
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,440
The Vanya Bhatt!

144
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:17,400
Think about all the people we
can inspire with this interview.

145
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,400
Okay, c'mon. Let's do it.

146
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,680
Really?

147
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,800
I like this agreeable new you.

148
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,040
What can I say? Marrying you
brings out the agreeable me.

149
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,920
Really?
What else are you agreeing to?

150
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,720
Oh, my God. Putting together a wedding
is so much work.

151
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,720
I need a vacation after this.

152
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,880
I agree.

153
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,880
In-room dining.

154
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,600
Good morning.

155
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,360
We have orange juice, fresh fruits,
corn flakes and eggs Florentine.

156
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,520
What is the need for this?

157
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,440
It's nothing.
Just room service.

158
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,760
But I promise you, every morning
in Singapore will be just like this.

159
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,160
It's okay.

160
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,120
Sorry.

161
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,880
Dee, are you moving to Singapore?

162
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,320
I know I'm cute and pretty.

163
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,600
But my mother...

164
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,760
She is a catch.

165
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,880
And she's spent her entire life
trying to turn me into her.

166
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,840
27 setups and 11 blind dates later,

167
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,760
I'm still as single
as the day I was born.

168
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,200
My mother, though, has graduated
to giving me pointers on sex.

169
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,600
Because what you can't get with
your face, you can get with your vagina.

170
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,440
I'm really scared she's
going to show up on my next date

171
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,520
and give me point-by-point instructions...

172
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,120
on how to give a blowjob.

173
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,640
"Siddhi, give that blowjob properly.

174
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,760
C'mon. Get to it already!"

175
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,480
But boy, do I love her.

176
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,640
Sounds pretty fucked up, right?

177
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,000
It is.

178
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,120
So, I thought why not make
a career out of talking about it.

179
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,720
Here I am, Siddhi Patel and
this is my application.

180
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,600
Thank you.

181
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,720
Was it good?

182
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,040
Still not over Sneha?

183
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,640
I am what I am because of Sneha.

184
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,080
And I often think if
Sneha wasn't this person,

185
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,240
who would I be?

186
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,760
I think this distance
is going to do me some good.

187
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,000
And her, too.

188
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,080
Come.

189
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,080
Let's do this.

190
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,720
C'mon. Just do it.

191
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,760
I just hope they don't think
I'm trying too hard.

192
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,440
Siddhi, they'll be really crazy
not to take you in.

193
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,840
Just do it. Come.

194
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,760
Okay!

195
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,000
Well-done.

196
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,080
I should tell Papa.
He'll be damn excited!

197
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,400
He'll be so proud of you.

198
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,840
-Listen, I'm going to get ready.
-Ya.

199
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,520
The person whom you're trying to reach
is currently unavailable.

200
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,800
Please leave a message after the beep.

201
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,280
Papa, I have good news.
Call me back quickly.

202
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,280
Okay, bye.
Bye! Love you.

203
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,240
Going live in three, two, one.

204
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,440
Over to you, Vanya.

205
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,520
Hello and welcome
to The Vanya Bhatt Show.

206
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,520
Today we're here in this gorgeous location
with two phenomenal women...

207
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,400
who are breaking the internet with
their lifestyle choices.

208
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,800
Please welcome the gorgeous
and India's sweetheart,

209
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,240
Samara Kapoor and Umang Singh.

210
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,160
Welcome to the show, ladies.

211
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,920
-Thank you so much for having us, Vanya.
-Thanks.

212
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,480
And, most importantly,
congratulations are in order.

213
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,880
Thank you so much.

214
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,160
So, diving straight
into the conversation.

215
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,080
Samara, now that you've come out...

216
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,240
and you'll be marrying your partner
Umang here very soon,

217
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,320
do you feel offers to play
romantic lead will dry up?

218
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,440
For the reason that
the Indian audience...

219
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,960
just wouldn't believe that you can
fall in love with a hero.

220
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,440
That may have been the case
up until two years ago.

221
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:36,640
But now, roles for women extend
far beyond just romancing the hero.

222
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,880
Just because Sam has the courage
to live her truth,

223
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,840
I don't think she should be
punished for it.

224
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,600
In fact, she's not the only one.

225
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,520
I think what Umang is
trying to say is...

226
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,480
everyone has the right to
live their own life.

227
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,400
And they'll do it in their own time.
Just like we did.

228
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,320
Absolutely. But coming back to Umang.

229
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,000
You mentioned she's not the only one.

230
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,280
Care to elaborate on that?
Who are these people?

231
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,520
Vanya, I really don't think that
that's what she meant.

232
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,200
You know all about it.
It's an open secret.

233
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,600
There are so many powerful people
in this entertainment industry...

234
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,200
who still live in fear.

235
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,240
Because they feel
they'll be judged harshly.

236
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,040
Their popularity may diminish.

237
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,760
Or they may stop getting work
because of it.

238
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,600
Do you think these people are right?

239
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,840
No, I...

240
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,920
-Vanya, if you ask me...
-I feel that...

241
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,360
-What I want to...
-If not now, when?

242
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,320
If none of them have the
courage to speak up,

243
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,600
what hope do the rest have?

244
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,760
I'm a nobody but Samara has shown courage.

245
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,680
She's living her truth
in front of the whole world.

246
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,240
And I just think that everybody
should be more like Sam.

247
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,520
You should just speak up and
speak your truth.

248
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,400
Absolutely.

249
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,880
Let's get her some water, guys.

250
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,040
Can we...

251
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,520
Sure. Yes, please.
Get her some water, guys.

252
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,400
I don't get these people!

253
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,800
I was just being honest.
What's with the backlash!

254
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,800
They're such hypocrites.

255
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,680
It's all double standards!

256
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,360
I think that interviews
are not such a good idea.

257
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,400
But what's wrong with what I said?

258
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,720
It's not about right or wrong.

259
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,240
You have to be careful of your words...

260
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,320
else they become headlines.

261
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,560
Or worse still...

262
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,640
memes.

263
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,200
I'll see you later, babe.

264
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,840
Sushmita.

265
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,400
I didn't know that you didn't know.

266
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,600
Anjana, you were married once.

267
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,640
How could you do this to someone else?

268
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:03,880
At this point, no matter what I say
it'll just sound wrong so...

269
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,800
No.

270
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,160
No, no.

271
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,920
You don't get off that easy.

272
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,200
I needed to feel alive again...

273
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,680
and I guess I just gave in.

274
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,040
At my expense?

275
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,560
There weren't supposed
to be any casualties.

276
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,440
Look around you.

277
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,040
I'm sorry about that.

278
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,640
What would you have done
if you were in my shoes?

279
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,200
I don't know.

280
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,440
For the first time in my life
I really don't know.

281
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,760
Will you forgive him?

282
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,200
After all these years together...

283
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,360
I don't know.

284
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,160
I love him.

285
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,880
Maybe we'll find our
way back to each other.

286
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,600
Maybe not. I don't...

287
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,240
I don't know.

288
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,520
But what would you have done
in my place?

289
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,560
I don't know either.

290
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,840
For the first time in my life, I...

291
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,440
don't know.

292
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,600
Jeh!

293
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,680
Jeh, bro you made it!

294
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,920
Oh, my God. Yay!

295
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,800
I knew you'd come.
I knew it.

296
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,000
Come.

297
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,080
Yes, Dad.

298
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,560
What news?

299
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,080
What do you mean "banning the book"?

300
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,040
How can they ban...
What do you mean?

301
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,280
Protecting law and order?

302
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,080
What protests?

303
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,080
Shame on you!

304
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,440
Rizvi Roy!
Shame on you!

305
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,000
Damini!
Shame on you!

306
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,320
Hang your head in shame Damini!

307
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,560
Hang your head in shame!

308
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,040
Down with Rizvi Roy!
Shame on Rizvi Roy!

309
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,520
Down with Rizvi Roy!
Shame on Rizvi Roy!

310
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,640
Down with Rizvi Roy!
Shame on Rizvi Roy!

311
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:44,000
Down with Damini!
Hang your head in shame Damini!

312
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,800
Hit them.
Get them!

313
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,680
Down with Rizvi Roy!
Hang your head in shame!

314
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,000
It's so good.

315
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,560
Anj, eat something.

316
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,720
Ya.

317
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,320
Are you still stressed?

318
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,240
Chill. It's okay.
Everybody's forgotten.

319
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,240
Dee?

320
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,680
-What happened?
-Dee, are you okay?

321
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,280
Sit down. Just sit.

322
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,440
-What happened?
-Dad called.

323
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,080
The book is being banned.

324
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:36,960
-What?
-God.

325
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,920
There are protests everywhere and...

326
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,320
the bookstores are being stoned.

327
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,320
Okay, just calm down.
Just breathe.

328
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,320
Don't tell anyone, please.

329
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,200
I don't want Mangs'
celebration to get ruined.

330
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,240
Ya, ya.

331
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,520
It's okay.

332
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,160
You guys, look who it is.

333
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,160
It's the bro-man Jeh!

334
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,920
Jeh...

335
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,880
You came.

336
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,920
I did. I had to.

337
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,320
For Umang.

338
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,000
Of course.

339
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,200
I...

340
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,280
I was sitting on the flight and...

341
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,800
I didn't know why
I was on the flight.

342
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,760
I mean...

343
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,760
I thought I came for Umang but...

344
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,960
I don't know what to do.
I don't know why I came, I mean...

345
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,680
-Jeh...
-I mean... I do...

346
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,240
-Jeh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Jeh.
-Don't, Damini.

347
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,880
I'm sorry.

348
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,480
I thought I knew what I wanted.

349
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,800
I thought I knew where
my life was headed.

350
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,560
You know, I'm so used to
living life in binaries.

351
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,880
Black-white.

352
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,440
True-false.
Wrong-right.

353
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,200
But you...

354
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,800
You overwhelm me.

355
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,000
You confuse me.
You exasperate me.

356
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,320
I don't know what's
right or wrong anymore.

357
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,240
You've messed my head up, Damini.

358
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,160
And I like it.

359
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,800
I love...

360
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,800
that life is messy when
I'm with you.

361
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,960
Look...
What I'm trying to say is...

362
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,320
I...

363
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,280
I know I'm not this baby's father but...

364
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,320
Damini, I want to be with you.

365
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,960
And I want to raise a baby with you.

366
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,000
So you know, let's just be.

367
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,440
Let's just be.

368
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,960
Great speech, Jeh.

369
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,080
You're a little late though.

370
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,200
Damini and I are moving to Singapore
where we're going to bring up our child.

371
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,960
-No.
-You're moving to Singapore with him?

372
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,400
I never said that.

373
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,560
Umang, what the hell is he doing here?

374
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,640
You didn't tell me he was here.

375
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,720
Fuck.

376
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,000
And you drop a bomb in my lap?

377
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,280
You couldn't give me 72 hours
before I could digest the news?

378
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,640
Listen, I never said yes.

379
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,280
Aamir, why would you say
something like this?

380
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,080
You didn't say no either.

381
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,160
Can't you be by yourself
for even a minute?

382
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,520
C'mon, I never said yes.
I never said yes!

383
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,440
Well, you should have.

384
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,280
This boy...

385
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,800
who runs to his ex-girlfriend crying
every time he feels an ouchie.

386
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,800
Do you really want to
live with him?

387
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,440
Stop being so condescending, Uncle.

388
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,280
Did you just call me Uncle?

389
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,080
Aamir!

390
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,320
Well, you keep calling me boy.

391
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,200
-Uncle.
-Hey you guys, please man!

392
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,400
Jeh. Aamir!

393
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,320
Guys!
Oh, my God!

394
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,760
-Are you kidding me right now!
-Fuck!

395
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,160
Guys, please!

396
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,560
Guys!

397
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,360
Relax. Relax.

398
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,960
-Guys...
-What are they doing?

399
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,000
-Jeh!
-What the fuck!

400
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,440
Guys.

401
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,480
-Stop it, guys! Please!
-You guys!

402
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,880
-Dee, stop screaming.
-Guys! Please!

403
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,760
You guys.
Please man.

404
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,680
Stop behaving like children!

405
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,600
Let go.
Just stop it. Just stop it.

406
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,680
-Where is Damini?
-Oh, God!

407
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,000
-Where is Dee?
-Just do something about this.

408
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,560
Where did she go?
Where did she go?

409
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Shit!

410
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,000
Honestly!

411
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:41,760
Breathe in, breathe in.
One, two, three, four.

412
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,160
Breathe out.

413
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,920
Breathe out.
One, two, three, four.

414
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,400
Here...this one.

415
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,240
It's open.

416
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,400
Dee...

417
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,480
-Where is she?
-Damini!

418
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,920
Dee?

419
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,280
Is she here?

420
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,960
-Dee, open the door.
-Damini?

421
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,080
Dee...
Dee, open the door please.

422
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,040
Damini, I'm sorry.
Just please come out.

423
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,400
Damini, I'm sorry as well.

424
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,200
Come out.
It's not good for the baby.

425
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,040
Dee, please open the door.

426
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,720
Dee, we're all here for you.

427
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,680
-What happened?
-Dee!

428
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,920
I'm bleeding.

429
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,080
12 weeks.
Spotting and cramps.

430
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,080
And she has a history
of hypertension and anxiety.

431
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,560
Damini, miscarriages happen.

432
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,640
And it's nothing you've done.

433
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,480
You're a very strong and
healthy woman.

434
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,360
You can try again later.

435
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,640
Don't worry.

436
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,280
But, for now, just heal.

437
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,600
Alright?

438
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,120
You can take her home now.

439
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,120
Dee, if you don't want to
come to the wedding--

440
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,400
I want to.

441
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,040
Are you sure?

442
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,320
Yes, Mangs.

443
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,400
But I think you...

444
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,640
What about this?
It doesn't fit.

445
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,880
This is really nice.

446
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,560
Loosen it up a little.

447
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,000
Or you have this as well.

448
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,840
-Coming!
-I'll go get it.

449
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,040
No wait, I'll go.

450
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,480
Relax! I'm not incapacitated, guys.

451
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,760
-Okay...
-See, look at this.

452
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,120
Ma'am, room service.

453
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,520
How long were you two going to wait?

454
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,040
As long as you want.

455
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,640
No, I meant outside the room.

456
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,960
Listen...

457
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,520
Too much has happened too soon.

458
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:51,800
I just need some time and
space to process everything.

459
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,240
All of it.

460
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,360
Sure.

461
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,320
Can I just see this
for a second, please?

462
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,920
-Oh!
-You look beautiful!

463
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,840
-You look so cute...
-So, should we put...

464
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,480
Holy shit.

465
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,880
Can you do some rolls for her?

466
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,120
Hello. Hello.

467
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:33,920
Hello?

468
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,720
Hi, Mitch. How are you?

469
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,120
Oh, my God. Baby...
I've never seen you like this before.

470
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,320
-She looks beautiful!
-You look beautiful!

471
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,760
-She looks beautiful!
-So pretty!

472
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,240
And she's speechless, too.

473
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,440
For the first time.

474
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,720
What happened?

475
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,120
-Oh, my God!
-We got her sedated.

476
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,560
So beautiful.

477
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,400
Are you guys ready?
Are you ready?

478
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,680
-Our Mangs is now yours.
-I'm ready.

479
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,560
No, just kidding.
She will always be ours.

480
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,040
I'm just being a little dramatic.

481
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,560
-Okay.
-But... take good care of her.

482
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,400
I will.
I promise.

483
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,800
You both!

484
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,320
-Are you ready?
-We're ready.

485
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,120
-We should get going.
-Come.

486
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,920
I'm so excited.
Oh my...

487
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,880
Wow. Look at that.

488
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,960
This is the happiest day of my life.

489
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,960
Mine, too.

490
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,040
I've been cast in a Hollywood film.

491
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,160
Sorry?

492
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,320
I just got a call from Mitch Sanders.

493
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,760
He's one of the
biggest producers in LA.

494
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,920
He produced last summer's superhero
blockbuster, The Dark Warriors.

495
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,600
And he wants me.

496
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,640
Me to be in the sequel!

497
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,360
-That's great news! Congratulations.
-Ya!

498
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,680
Ya. I have to get
super-fit super quickly.

499
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,240
I have to be in LA
by the end of the week.

500
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,080
But from here we go to London
to legalize the wedding, right?

501
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,480
And then, to Maldives
for the honeymoon?

502
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:43,160
I've booked our tickets from
London to LA.

503
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,800
So, we're going to have to
postpone the honeymoon but...

504
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,560
I'm going to wrangle us
a beach house in Santa Monica.

505
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,280
We'll honeymoon for 18 months!

506
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,040
Wait. 18 months?

507
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,160
Between training, prep and filming,
it'll take a lot of time.

508
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,800
It's a superhero film.

509
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:15,680
So right after this, you want to
take off to LA for 18 months?

510
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,680
Not me.
Us.

511
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:24,760
You want me to head to LA with you?
For 18 months?

512
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,040
You've said 18 months thrice already.

513
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,800
Because I'm in shock, Sam.

514
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,520
What about my life,
my friends, my career?

515
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,840
My clients?

516
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,440
Babe, your career won't suffer.
Okay?

517
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,240
You'll be my private trainer like before.
Production will pay for you.

518
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,440
I've already informed the producers.

519
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,880
-Wow. You've informed them?
-Yes.

520
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,160
Even they know what's going to
happen before me?

521
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,680
Are you kidding me?

522
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,200
You haven't brought this up even once
before taking up the offer.

523
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,000
You're basically telling me that...

524
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,760
for the rest of my life,
I should follow you around everywhere.

525
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,400
Without any say in the decision?

526
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,760
Hi!

527
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:17,080
Look. It all happened
very suddenly, okay?

528
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,240
He saw my films and he
sent me a couple of scenes.

529
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,400
And I recorded an audition.

530
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,160
When?

531
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,360
Last week.

532
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,320
Then, I was on a call with him...

533
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,360
the night before last because
he wanted to discuss the character...

534
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,120
and he just wanted to hear my thoughts.

535
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,160
The time you took off from the dance floor
saying it was wedding stuff?

536
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,680
Look.

537
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,640
Babe, I didn't want to upset you.

538
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,160
You lied to me.

539
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,840
-Why aren't they here?
-I don't know.

540
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,000
Yes. Don't worry.

541
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,120
Look.

542
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:59,560
In this business,
offers fall through all the time.

543
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,080
What would've been the point
to tell you if I didn't get it?

544
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,160
You went behind my back
and did all of this.

545
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,760
Is this how you want
our marriage to begin, Sam?

546
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,960
With a lie?

547
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,600
Where are they?

548
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,360
Sam, do you even want this?

549
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,920
Of course, I want this.

550
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,920
How can you even say that?

551
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,040
Or even think it?

552
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,120
I love you more than I've ever loved
anybody else before in my life.

553
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,880
Why does being in love mean that
I have to put my career second?

554
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,040
And why does being in love mean that
I have to sacrifice my career?

555
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,760
C'mon.

556
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,240
Let's get married.

557
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,360
Hey. Let's do this.

558
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:40,640
When Umang asked me to be
the wedding officiator, I thought...

559
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,000
who am I to be giving
marriage advice because...

560
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:46,280
my own marriage lasted 13 months!

561
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,120
But then I realized...

562
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,840
that's also probably why I could
give you the best advice.

563
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,640
So standing here today,
Umang and Samara, I can tell you...

564
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,480
that you may have
the best plans laid out...

565
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,920
but none of that will work
if you don't have trust.

566
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:10,800
Marriage can be beautiful if
treated with fairness and kindness.

567
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,640
So, do not take it for granted.

568
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:20,640
It requires work, it requires attention
and most of all, it requires love.

569
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,360
Which I know both of you
have plenty of.

570
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,920
You're soon going to be
each other's family...

571
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,400
and that is the most
special relationship in the world.

572
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,520
On that note,
it's time to take your vows.

573
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,000
Umang.

574
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,600
Before we met,

575
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:47,800
maybe I didn't know
what love meant.

576
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,640
I was broken and
you put me together with love.

577
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:59,160
You taught me there are more
important things than the self.

578
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:04,560
That each half of the partnership
has to support the other half equally.

579
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,160
Or the two sides don't fit.

580
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:14,040
Let alone the world,
I lost faith in myself.

581
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,600
And you taught me to
trust myself again.

582
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:27,000
You have my heart, my body, my soul,
my spirit, it's all yours to keep.

583
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,480
Umang Singh, I love you.

584
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,560
Be my wife.

585
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,440
Love.

586
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:48,000
Perhaps the most
overused word in the world.

587
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:55,080
I love this place, I love this coffee,
I love this movie, I love him.

588
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,120
But if you end up loving everything, then
what does love truly mean?

589
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,600
What I feel for you Sam,
is so much more than love.

590
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,960
Each day of my life
begins and ends with you.

591
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,080
What you said... is absolutely right.

592
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,520
Both halves have to be there equally.

593
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,880
Because how can there be
respect without equality?

594
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:29,640
And how can there be
love without respect?

595
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,440
Sam, garlands.

596
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,080
Umang.

597
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,040
-Here.
-Mangs.

598
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,520
Mangs?

599
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,320
Mangs?

600
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,640
Do you feel there's
equality in our relationship?

601
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,120
It's all about you.

602
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,960
I don't even exist.

603
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:00,440
The only one who's
always sacrificing is me.

604
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,640
But...

605
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,640
But Umang, we love each other.

606
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,200
Is love enough in marriage?

607
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,600
I've witnessed marriages
in my own family...

608
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:17,080
where one speaks
and the other is always spoken at.

609
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,000
That's exactly what I ran away from.

610
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,640
To a more equal world.

611
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,040
And I'm sorry, Sam.
I love you so much but...

612
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,880
I don't think I can do this.

613
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,880
I...

614
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:32,080
I can't be with someone
and be second to everything all my life.

615
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,680
But Umang, what are you trying to say?

616
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,000
-I'm sorry.
-What are you saying?

617
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,320
Umang!

618
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,760
Umang!

619
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,160
Mangs!

620
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,160
Mangs!

621
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,640
Mangs, please stop!

622
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,800
Mangs!

623
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,360
-Mangs, please stop!
-Stop!

624
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,200
Not now!

625
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,080
Mangs!

626
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,160
Mangs.

627
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,160
You look like shit.

628
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,640
And yet again, it's just us.

629
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,160
Me and my three favorites.

630
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,160
There's nowhere else I would rather be.

631
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,560
With no one else I'd rather be with.

632
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,360
I love you guys so much.

633
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,520
-I love you, too.
-Love you too, Mangs.

634
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,160
Hello? Papa! Guess what!

635
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,160
Oh sorry! Mummy? Guess...

636
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:40,920
Siddhi.

637
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,440
Siddhi?

638
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,040
What's wrong?

639
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,160
Papa.

640
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,480
Heart attack.

641
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,760
What?

642
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,640
He's gone.

643
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,400
Siddhi!

644
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,040
-He's gone, Anj!
-Siddhi!

645
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,120
He's gone.

646
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,000
Oh, my God.

647
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,760
Siddhi!

648
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,840
Fuck.

649
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,160
God!
