1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,720
Life has no GPS.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,280
So, your only options are either
instinct or taking a gamble.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,200
All you can do is step on it

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,880
and hope there isn't a
dead end up ahead.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,160
-Hey babe...
-That looks good.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,920
No way.

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,560
No way! Holy crap!

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,720
Are you serious?

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,240
6,000 new followers on Snaptime.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,680
200 on Textbook.

11
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,880
And 350 on Flitter!

12
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,280
-What!
-My God, they fucking love us!

13
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,720
-Baby, look at this.
-Oh, my God!

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,040
Holy crap!

15
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,600
Can we take a selfie?

16
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,520
Both of us.

17
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,280
Oh! No way!

18
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,560
Dude, where is he from?

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,280
Okay, let's play rapid fire.

20
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,800
-Oh God!
-Okay?

21
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,280
Whose your favorite amongst
the three Khans?

22
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,800
All three are my friends.

23
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,680
So... I can't rate them.

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,360
-Do you rate your friends?
-Yes, she does.

25
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,240
-All the time.
-Okay. Tell me...

26
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,080
Is it true that in Bollywood, everybody
sleeps around with everybody?

27
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,520
Is it like a musical chairs
of romantic liasons?

28
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,440
Just so you know, you don't have to
answer these questions.

29
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,160
No, listen. I...
I want to.

30
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,360
Look, I'm sure that people
sleep around.

31
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,840
But that happens everywhere.
Right?

32
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,560
What about you?

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Siddhi!

34
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,600
What about me?

35
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,040
No, I mean...

36
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,440
have you played?

37
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,040
Musical chairs?

38
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,600
Look...

39
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,840
Before Umang, I had only been
in two relationships.

40
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,720
One was a boy from Boston University
which was about...

41
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,960
three years.

42
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,840
And...

43
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,160
I'm sure you must've heard of Raghuveer.

44
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,400
All the tabloids were writing about it.

45
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,360
And that was about six years.

46
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,600
Three years and six years.
Wow!

47
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,480
What can I say, it takes me a while
but when I commit...

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,880
Then you listen to no one.
Not even yourself.

49
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,480
I only listen to Mangs.

50
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,880
Excuse me, ma'am, can we
take a picture with you?

51
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,920
Sure.

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,600
Ma'am, could you join us?

53
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,480
Mangs!
Dude!

54
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,400
-Go, go.
-Please.

55
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,760
C'mon.

56
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,600
If I had known that Samara Kapoor
would be coming,

57
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,760
I would've put a cover charge.

58
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,760
There you go.

59
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,760
Hi, Samara.

60
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,720
-Welcome to Truck Bar.
-This is Jeh. And this is his bar.

61
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,960
Oh! Hey, Jeh...

62
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,440
Love the bar. Thanks.

63
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,520
Thanks.

64
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,920
Missed you.

65
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,320
Get a room, guys.

66
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,320
-Maybe I will.
-Maybe you should.

67
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,400
Oh! I like this new, saucy Jeh 2.0!

68
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,360
Hey! Hashtag, Umara.

69
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,240
Do you want to be my celebrity
bartenders tonight?

70
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,400
-Your tabs on me.
-What. Seriously?

71
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,840
What about us?

72
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,400
-What about us Jeh?
-You're not a celebrity!

73
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,040
We'll drink on the house.

74
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,040
And sell the hell out of this
bar tonight!

75
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,760
-Is that okay with you?
-Just do it!

76
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,520
-Alright, let's do it!
-Alright, let's go!

77
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,560
Okay, you guys.

78
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,920
All the specials are coming up.

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,920
Right now!

80
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,240
C'mon! C'mon!

81
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,920
Let's go! Drink up!

82
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,800
-Hey. Hey.
-What?

83
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,240
I think we should slow down.

84
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,080
Let's do things
the right way this time.

85
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,240
Missionary style?

86
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,120
No! I meant a date.

87
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,360
A date?

88
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,600
Have you realized that we haven't
been on a real date yet?

89
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,440
Ya but...

90
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,160
People go on dates

91
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,600
so, that eventually they can do
what we're doing right now.

92
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,360
Some people also go on a date...

93
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,600
because they want to spend time
with each other.

94
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,360
You know, good food,
good conversation. Fun?

95
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,920
Fun? What kind of fun?
This is fun.

96
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,800
What kind of food?

97
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,440
Is alcohol allowed?

98
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,240
Is it chargeable?

99
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,040
-Wow!
-Ready?

100
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,200
Absolutely!

101
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,560
Okay, then!

102
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,920
No!

103
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,360
Yay!

104
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,320
-Are you ready?
-Just do it.

105
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,520
And I am the winner!

106
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,680
I am the Monopoly king.

107
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,320
All this property is mine and I...

108
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,480
am the ruler of this world!

109
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,440
No! Jeh!

110
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,560
Tell me a secret.

111
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,560
What kind of secret?

112
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,400
I don't know.
Maybe something that's embarrassing?

113
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,480
No...

114
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,880
Okay.

115
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,320
No judgment zone, right?

116
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,320
Of course.

117
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,040
So I'm generally like a camel.

118
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,760
I can hold my pee in for hours.

119
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,640
It's a real talent.

120
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,280
So, I was giving my class
tenth board exams. Math exam.

121
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,800
And I was left with all my
six marks questions.

122
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,080
So...

123
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,680
So?

124
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,880
So, I...

125
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,640
peed right there!

126
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,480
Don't look at me like that!
Nobody got to know!

127
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,080
It's fine! Nobody got to know!

128
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,920
-I just spilled some water!
-Is it a bird?

129
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,360
Is it a plane?

130
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,000
-No! It's Ms. PeePee!
-C'mon! Please!

131
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,720
You said, no judgment now!

132
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,120
Your turn.

133
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,000
-Ya, go on!
-My story is a little too embarrassing.

134
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,480
Okay, let me guess.

135
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,800
Your parents caught you having sex.

136
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,560
No but the reverse.

137
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,360
No!

138
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,560
-Ya.
-No, no.

139
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,360
Yuck! No!

140
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,840
Ya. I was eight years old and
I had a nightmare.

141
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,760
-Okay.
-So, I got scared

142
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,160
and I went to my parents' bedroom...

143
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,320
And they were...

144
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,240
you know...

145
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,680
And I thought my dad was
attacking my mom.

146
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,400
So I shouted at him, slapped him...

147
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,840
and then punched him!

148
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,200
-Your dad?
-Yes, my dad!

149
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,320
And for the next four days,

150
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,760
he moved around with a black eye!

151
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,360
Telling everybody
he walked into a door.

152
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,160
-Can you imagine?
-No!

153
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,840
-Sorry! I walked into a door!
-Your dad is amazing!

154
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,960
Oh, my God!

155
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,480
That's a great story!

156
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,280
You win. Hands down!

157
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,560
On that note...

158
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,360
part three of the date
of the century awaits.

159
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,560
Look what I got.

160
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,040
Raspberry soda!

161
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,520
-Yum.
-Yum.

162
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,120
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

163
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,120
Is this Mumbai or Santorini?

164
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,480
Ya, except for the smell.

165
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,360
I don't care.

166
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,200
I would choose Bombay over
any other city in the world.

167
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,440
-Any day.
-Yep!

168
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,160
Why haven't I done this before?

169
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,160
You should answer that.
Why haven't you done this before?

170
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,520
Maybe because...

171
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,080
you weren't around.

172
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,280
Ekalaya needs a public apology, Shashank.

173
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,520
I love your blinding optimism.

174
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,520
And we also need 40% profit
share on all sales till date.

175
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,120
Along with the withdrawal
of the design worldwide.

176
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,600
This isn't a negotiation.
This is daylight robbery. So, stop.

177
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,760
This is nothing.

178
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,280
If the case goes to trial then...

179
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,760
Adalene might win?

180
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,280
Consider that?

181
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,640
Nothing in this world
is original, Ms. Menon.

182
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,840
From your favorite Shakespearean
play to your favorite book...

183
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,840
to all the wonderful music you listen to.

184
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,040
All art is inspired by pre-existing art.

185
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,880
Would you care for a drink?

186
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,120
No, thanks.

187
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,440
There's a difference between
inspiration and theft.

188
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,520
Who decides that?

189
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:22,200
Sometimes the things we see,
the people we meet, affect us.

190
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,600
Subconsciously.

191
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,200
Like you and me.

192
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,320
Is that right?

193
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,840
Do you not feel it too?

194
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,880
We're opposing lawyers, Shashank.

195
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,440
It's unethical.

196
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,120
Then I guess this is...

197
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,360
conflict resolution, isn't it?

198
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,600
You're married.

199
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,440
Yes, I am.

200
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,320
But Sushmita and I have
an open marriage.

201
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,400
And we're free to be and
see other people.

202
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,120
That's what keeps us happily married.

203
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,040
Human beings...

204
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,640
They aren't meant for monogamy.

205
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,240
But...

206
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,200
monogamy is a way of life for me.

207
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,160
Don't knock something before you try it.

208
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,040
I can't...

209
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,760
get you out of my mind, Anjana.

210
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,640
I can't.

211
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,840
I didn't know...

212
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,520
I was that imposing.

213
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,520
Yes, you are.

214
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,520
You're fucking imposing, you're...

215
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,520
amazing, you're...

216
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,200
Please understand this.

217
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,040
If you don't feel the same about me, then…

218
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,280
I will stop immediately.

219
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,640
I will back off and...

220
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,360
never ask you again.

221
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,800
But I have to know.

222
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,360
What is it...

223
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,240
that you really want, Anjana?

224
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,400
I want...

225
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,840
I want to get back to work.

226
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,160
Work it is.

227
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,720
So... where were we?

228
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,000
Here...

229
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,840
-Hormonal!
-Ya?

230
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,920
What if your parents wake up?

231
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,160
Then, you're dead.

232
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,080
Papa has a hockey stick.

233
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,160
Just saying.

234
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,800
-Everyone has one.
-Not everyone.

235
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,680
Come.

236
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,480
This sneaking around
is very hot.

237
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,520
Ready?

238
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,600
Ms. Thakur and Ms. Khanna.

239
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,960
Your lawyer and I were up late
last night trying to work out a deal.

240
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,360
Unfortunately, we here at
Adalene SA believe that...

241
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,120
you don't have a case.

242
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,640
And we're not willing
to offer any compensation

243
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,160
or apology at this given time.

244
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,720
We're ready to fight this case
till the very end.

245
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,440
It'll be years of litigation.
It will be a long wait.

246
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,120
But, I'll leave the decision
to the both of you.

247
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,120
So, this plagiarized dress

248
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,240
was designed by the head designer
of Adalene, Marcella Marchand?

249
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:30,080
The original design
was indeed by Ms. Marchand.

250
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,360
You've done your homework.

251
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,680
Congratulations.

252
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,400
Perhaps you haven't.

253
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,520
Have you heard of the
Milan Fashion Biennale?

254
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,880
Of course. What about it?

255
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,160
In 2010, my client Ms. Khanna was
present at the Milan Fashion Biennale

256
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,880
where she and Ekalaya received an award
for preserving cultural heritage.

257
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,400
Glad to know.
But, how is this relevant right now?

258
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,440
That very day, another young designer
also received an award.

259
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,520
A young French college student
by the name of Marcella Marchand.

260
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,520
She won the award for
The Most Promising New Designer.

261
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,360
So?
That proves nothing.

262
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,560
But this does.

263
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,480
This is a picture of all the winners.

264
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,760
Marcella Marchand is here.

265
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,600
Ms. Khanna is here.

266
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,960
In the picture, Ms. Khanna is wearing
an outfit made of the same fabric

267
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,000
that was plagiarized by Adalene.

268
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,520
This picture was sent to
all the winners.

269
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,920
And... here's the confirmation mail
from the Biennale organizers.

270
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,200
Shall we discuss the
settlement terms, Mr. Bose?

271
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,720
That wasn't a defeat.

272
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,400
It was a goddamn massacre.

273
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,400
When did you know?

274
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,800
Actually, Ekalaya showed me
the picture a while back

275
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,520
but the confirmation from Milan Biennale
came in this morning.

276
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,080
Join me.

277
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,520
Sorry?

278
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,960
I meant at my firm.

279
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,240
As a senior partner, of course.

280
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,680
Full package, benefits, the works.

281
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,920
Seriously?

282
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,040
Why?

283
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,880
Because it's been a while since
I've been defeated.

284
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,320
And I love that ferocity of yours.

285
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,120
So, I would like you to fight with me.
Not against me.

286
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,040
Simple.

287
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,040
My God!

288
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,560
I can literally hear the chaos
in your head all the way here.

289
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,400
Should I do it? Should I not do it?

290
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,600
What is he saying?
It's too fast. It's too sudden.

291
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,080
What's wrong with this guy?

292
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,480
I'll tell you what.

293
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,320
Have another drink and
then think about it.

294
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,360
One drink is meant for enemies.

295
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,200
Then I guess I'm the enemy.

296
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,320
Too much self-control, I must say.

297
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:10,280
The difference between
want and need is self-control.

298
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,680
Heavy.

299
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,560
Ya. Well...

300
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,560
I also will add,
I got this really nice corner office.

301
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,040
Banging view to the city.
Two holiday packages a year.

302
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,640
Come when you want,
go when you want.

303
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,840
I'm just saying.

304
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,760
You know, that you should...

305
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,760
think about it.

306
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,480
Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.
Of course.

307
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,680
Okay, ma'am. Thank you.

308
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,760
Thank you so much.

309
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,600
I don't believe it.

310
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,320
That was Sheetal Marwah.

311
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,000
She wants me to train her!

312
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,360
Ya, she messaged asking
for your number.

313
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,480
I also gave your number to
Akshay Malhotra and Yasmeen D'Souza.

314
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,320
They're huge superstars.
They could have anyone.

315
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,560
Why would they want me?

316
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,080
Because they want the best.

317
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,360
I have been right here all this time.

318
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,400
One viral video of us comes out and...

319
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,760
What? That's it?
I'm like the hottest trainer in town?

320
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,440
Just ride the wave, babe.
Don't question it.

321
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,640
I mean... look at me.

322
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,960
I was shifting time zones
every week for ten years and now...

323
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,080
nobody wants to touch me.

324
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,800
You'll be jet-setting across
time zones in no time, I know it.

325
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,560
Baby boo, this is not about me.
This is about you.

326
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,760
These chances don't come easy.

327
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,080
You've got to make the most of it.

328
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,720
-This is why, I fucking love you!
-Oh, my God!

329
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,520
-I fucking love you!
-I love you!

330
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,400
Summertime abs, you gotta do it!

331
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,200
Alright! Very nice!

332
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,520
And now, burpees!

333
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,320
Give me five burpees.
C'mon, man!

334
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,440
All you! Let's go!

335
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,640
Five! Ya! All the way up!

336
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,200
Good job. Chest to the ground.
Very good. Hands up!

337
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,400
Keep it going...

338
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,920
Ya! Keep going.
Don't stop. Don't stop!

339
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,080
Let's go! You wanna go back?
Let's go back!

340
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,440
Thanks!

341
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,800
C'mon, Sheetal! You got this.
Let's go!

342
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,040
Nice! C'mon! Let's go!

343
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,880
You can do this!
C'mon, man! Let's go!

344
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,200
C'mon!
Push it! Ya!

345
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,920
Push! Ya!
Good job!

346
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,800
-Oh ya!
-My God! That was amazing!

347
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,040
-Did you enjoy it?
-Umang, you're just too good!

348
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,040
Ya! C'mon, boy! Let's go!

349
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,280
Let's go! You gotta look good
for the screen! Let's go!

350
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,560
Let's go. Five more.

351
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,280
Breathe again.
One, two, three, again.

352
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,400
You're the best!

353
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,720
Shall we start?

354
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,640
Let's wait a little longer?

355
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,680
The ones who're here will
start leaving.

356
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,240
I mean, these are anyway my friends.
Most of them.

357
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,800
How many copies have we sold?

358
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,160
Not many... but it will pick up.

359
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,240
How many is not many?

360
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,560
Four copies.

361
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,160
Let's start.

362
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,080
People will join in once
they hear you speak.

363
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,040
Ya?

364
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,520
Okay.

365
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,960
Good evening, everybody.

366
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,200
Thank you for joining us for
this very special reading...

367
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,440
of a book that I believe is extremely
relevant in current times.

368
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,240
Over to you, Damini.

369
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,520
Thank you, Shraddha.

370
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,000
Thank you for accommodating me
in your beautiful store.

371
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,800
-Hi, guys.
-Hi!

372
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,800
I'm going to read out a little excerpt

373
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,960
from the opening chapter
of the book.

374
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,800
On the eve of India's independence,

375
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,040
as the clock struck midnight...

376
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,240
and the famous words of Nehru,

377
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,200
"Long years ago we made a
tryst with destiny", were uttered,

378
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,320
a baby boy was born
in the small village of Latur.

379
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,320
Twelve copies sold, baby.
Congratulations!

380
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,480
You mean two?
You guys bought ten.

381
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,520
So? People buy fake followers.

382
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,080
We're your real friends.

383
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,960
Okay, what can I do
to make you feel better?

384
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,880
Anything.

385
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,160
Oh, I have something in mind!

386
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:52,880
Fries, cheesy nachos and onion rings.

387
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,560
-Wow!
-Coming right up.

388
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,640
My stress eating's through the roof!

389
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,280
My period cycle is also off.

390
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,040
-First time?
-No! Happens to me all the time.

391
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,960
-So, then?
-Generally, it's late by

392
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,080
three to four days.

393
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,160
But this time it's three weeks.

394
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,320
Dee.

395
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,080
-This isn't stress.
-Then, what is it?

396
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,560
Maybe you should get a
pregnancy test done.

397
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,560
What?

398
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,800
Are you silly? No!

399
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,760
Stress causes hormonal imbalance.
We all know that.

400
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,920
Anyway, I'll...

401
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,320
Let me take Warsi's appointment
for tomorrow.

402
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,720
You still go to him?

403
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,560
Shit, you're right.
He hates me now.

404
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,240
Need a new gynec.

405
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,560
-I'll give you my gynec's number...
-Here you go.

406
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,920
Cheesy nachos, onion rings,
jalapeno poppers.

407
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,720
Wow! That looks good!

408
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,280
-Yummy!
-Thank you.

409
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,560
C'mon.

410
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,040
That's so strange.

411
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,160
Happy mothers and babies everywhere.

412
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,680
Have you heard of anti-natalists?

413
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,120
They are people who believe that the
world is already overcrowded.

414
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,400
And there is no need
for more babies.

415
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,080
Without babies,
there will be no family.

416
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,680
And if there's no family...

417
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,800
then what do we do with all
the love in our hearts?

418
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,200
It's all about narcissism.

419
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:14,080
Seeing your genes in someone else and
imposing your dreams on your children.

420
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,800
So, according to you the optimal
population of this world is zero?

421
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,600
Do you want babies?

422
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,920
Ya, sure. One day.

423
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,360
What about you?

424
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,400
I don't know.

425
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,880
I think I'd be a terrible mother.

426
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,480
Oh c'mon, you'll be fine.
You'll be great!

427
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,520
Because everyone tries their best.

428
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,360
I'm just scared.

429
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,760
I feel I'm going to turn into
my parents.

430
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,360
Don't get me wrong.
I mean, they loved us.

431
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,560
But we didn't really get to
be children.

432
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,320
We were treated like adults
since we were born.

433
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,280
We always only spoke about
economics and politics.

434
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:03,080
I think all my control issues...
come from there.

435
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,480
I think I may turn into my parents too.

436
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,240
But hey, that's okay.

437
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,160
I mean look at me...
I'm perfect.

438
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,640
Perfect!

439
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,840
Girls...

440
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,640
Amit thinks I should talk about my
life stories in my comedy sets.

441
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,480
But my life is so privileged.

442
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,760
Thank you.

443
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,160
Where will the material come from?

444
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,480
Why? Talk about your privileges.

445
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,720
And your problems.

446
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,080
Everyone has problems.
Talk about you and Sneha.

447
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,680
Dude. Talk about the unwrapping of your

448
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,760
well preserved virginity
after so many years!

449
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,600
Sids, I think you should
totally talk about body shaming.

450
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,000
-Yea
-And what was that guy's name?

451
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,360
-Which one?
-Who called you Sindhi...

452
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,240
-and sucked on your toes!
-Oh, God!

453
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,400
Dude!

454
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,440
Talk about your ballet lessons
and your dance with Falguni.

455
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,640
-That is life experience gold!
-Best!

456
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,960
And your marriage resume!

457
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,280
-Oh yeah...
-Long list.

458
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,400
Thanks you, guys.

459
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,440
I had no clue that my life is
such a joke for you all.

460
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,160
Now just use all this material
on-stage and thank us later.

461
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,520
-Okay? Go.
-Must thank us, Sids.

462
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,080
-Go.
-Thanks, guys.

463
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,920
-So lucky to have you as my best friends.
-Love you!

464
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,000
Likewise.

465
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,200
Check one, two, three...

466
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,440
One, two, three...

467
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,400
Wow, you guys look like you're
expecting a bad show.

468
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,000
Quite like the one
I recently walked into.

469
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,840
So my friend's roomie was in
the bathroom and...

470
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,160
for the lack of a better phrase...
he was jerking off.

471
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,800
And I walked in.

472
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,360
He was having a full blown
party in the bathroom.

473
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,640
With lotion, porn, tissues
and the works.

474
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:42,280
And... instead of being completely
mortified by my presence,

475
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,560
he chose to put his hand out.

476
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,080
For a handshake.

477
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,360
Not... no guys!

478
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,040
Not like a porn type handshake.

479
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,000
I mean there was porn and
there was a hand.

480
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:54,920
But no.

481
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:59,000
The guy was genuinely
feeling friendly at that moment.

482
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,440
And he wanted a handshake, that's it.

483
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:06,280
But seriously. What is it with men
and shaking things?

484
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,840
Okay, you tell me...

485
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,600
Are you guys off your rockers?
Is that why you're constantly shaking?

486
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,880
Or are you off your rockers because
you're constantly shaking?

487
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,760
It's either your hand or something else.

488
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,280
I know somebody in the audience

489
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,840
who's a Hindi grammar Nazi
is probably thinking...

490
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,160
madam, shaking your hand is not always
equal to a handshake.

491
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,720
I know, okay.

492
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,800
And speaking of handshakes...

493
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,080
last year I lost my
well preserved virginity.

494
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:41,080
I was always taught that
someone, somewhere is made for you.

495
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,160
Except that, my mom was the one
carrying out that search. Not me.

496
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,080
So, here I was... on a
third date with this guy

497
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,760
who my mum had found for me.

498
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,920
This is back when I was
still a virgin.

499
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,120
Now I find my own dates.

500
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,680
So anyway, back to the date.
It was a perfect date.

501
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,720
Perfect dinner, perfect wine,
perfect conversation.

502
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,400
Like...
What are your hobbies?

503
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,920
What is your zodiac sign?

504
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,280
Favorite Instagram filter?

505
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,440
So, he comes to my house to
drop me and we kiss.

506
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,560
And then...
I said okay, bye. Goodnight.

507
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,040
Thanks for a great time and
he was like...

508
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,640
Listen to this.

509
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,000
He was like...

510
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,280
that's it?

511
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,000
So, he thought that just because
he took me out thrice...

512
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,920
and insisted on
paying the bill thrice,

513
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,720
I owed him more than a kiss.

514
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,480
But fine, I said...

515
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:36,840
I told him that I am saving myself
from marriage.

516
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,360
And he was like, "Babe!

517
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,800
Don't make sex such a big deal!

518
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,520
It's just like...

519
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,000
a handshake!"

520
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,000
I said, great then!

521
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,520
Go jerk off to this handshake!

522
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,280
I'm not aware if he shook
anything that night

523
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,520
but I sure as hell shook up his manhood!

524
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,960
Go, Sids.

525
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,560
That's it guys. Thank you.
You've been fab!

526
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,920
Ready?

527
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,520
Mangs! Ear-neck-nibble-nibble!
Cleavage-tummy-gobble-gobble!

528
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,160
Go in, five thrusts, get out!

529
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,600
Even I know the routine now!

530
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,880
He's a set guy.

531
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,560
Comedy set, sex set.
Amazing!

532
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,240
Mangs, I've become an expert at faking it.

533
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,880
Sids, fake it till you make it!
And if not,

534
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:07,240
then you have to take this
into your own hands literally.

535
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,400
See... folded missionary,
wrapped missionary,

536
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,040
London plough, folded cowgirl...

537
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,400
Okay, bye.

538
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,440
-Oh. Sorry.
-All yours.

539
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,840
I have been following you on
Snaptime forever.

540
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,920
Forever? It's been just two years
since I joined Snaptime.

541
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,160
What? Two years?

542
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,080
No way! You've had such a
big impact.

543
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,440
I want to hang with you.

544
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,880
Get to know you, Umang.
Be you!

545
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,480
And that's what we need
for our streaming audience.

546
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,560
A video a week.

547
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,120
We plan, shoot, edit, stream.

548
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,120
Bang! Bang!
We hit them hard.

549
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,280
And you will be the face of India's new
fitness revolution!

550
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,640
Umang Singh!

551
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,320
But... why would anyone
want to see my fitness videos?

552
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,440
-You'll be an icon, Umang.
-Exactly.

553
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,600
For fitness. For women.
For the entire LGBTQIA community.

554
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,560
Just think about it.

555
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,560
Cheers.

556
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,120
What is the offer?

557
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,040
10% of the revenue.

558
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,200
You should ask for twenty.

559
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,360
Isn't that a bit much to begin with?

560
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,720
You're not just some random newcomer.

561
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,080
You are my girlfriend.

562
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,200
All my followers will watch
your videos.

563
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,800
Don't ask for lesser and
lower your status.

564
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,120
By the way, apparently one of
the producers...

565
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:37,360
has been following me
on Snaptime forever.

566
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,720
So, should I accept it?

567
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,480
Look, do whatever you want

568
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,160
but, do you even have the time?

569
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,440
I mean, your PT clients are
taking up all of your time.

570
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,480
Even I'm not getting a
chance to see you.

571
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,680
And that is your focus, right?

572
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,520
Ma'am, may I have your
autograph, please?

573
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,360
Of course, sweetheart.

574
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,320
-What's your name?
-Shivani.

575
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:07,240
To Shivani...
Love, Samara.

576
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,080
Shit.

577
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,920
Congratulations. It's confirmed.

578
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,760
You're about seven weeks pregnant.

579
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,720
No. Four weeks?

580
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,400
No, seven.

581
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:35,360
As per your last menstrual cycle,
conception happened about six weeks ago.

582
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,960
Between the first and seventh.

583
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,080
No, it has to be four weeks.

584
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:45,040
Between the...
18th and the 25th...

585
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,840
I had a meeting with Zigzag books
and then I went to meet Jeh...

586
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,440
Ya.

587
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,080
Damini, that would be
biologically impossible.

588
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,720
Trust me. I'm the doctor.

589
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,520
Anyway, shall we discuss the
steps ahead?

590
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,280
I'm assuming you're
carrying the baby to term?

591
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,520
Or are you thinking otherwise?

592
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,120
Because then, DNC is the only option.

593
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,440
You've come too far along
in the pregnancy.

594
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,360
So, basically you think Samara
is insecure of you?

595
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,280
I think I would've felt the same
if I were in her place.

596
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,200
She's the famous one yet
I'm the one getting the offers.

597
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,560
I think you're just
overthinking it, Mangs.

598
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,280
For such a long time,
Samara was your world.

599
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,200
Now you're going to get a
world of your own.

600
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,960
Maybe she feels bad that you guys
won't get enough time with each other.

601
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:32,920
That's all.

602
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,480
I hope you're right because
that sounds way better.

603
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,440
It is.

604
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,720
Jeh.

605
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,880
What's up, Jeh?

606
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,560
Have you heard from Damini?

607
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,840
No, why?

608
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,120
I've been calling her all morning
but she isn't answering.

609
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,760
Must be at home.

610
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,080
It's Dee.

611
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,240
-Hi Dee, where are you?
-Sids.

612
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,480
I am screwed!

613
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,800
-What happened? Are you okay?
-Umang.

614
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,640
-Jeh, I'll call you back.
-Just relax, we're coming.

615
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,440
I couldn't take care of that pup.

616
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,360
I killed off the only cactus
I had at home!

617
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,920
How am I going to take care of
a real human baby?

618
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,680
God! The nappies, the poop
and pee...

619
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,840
The baby's going to hate me.

620
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,480
I'll be one of those control freak
helicopter moms!

621
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,800
I mean... how am I going to
support it?

622
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,640
I'm the writer of a flop book.

623
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,880
Barely living out of my savings!

624
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,880
And Jeh...

625
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,800
What will I tell Jeh?

626
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,760
We just got back together.

627
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,120
He's barely started trusting me again.

628
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,080
And it's Warsi's job to deliver babies
and hand them over to others!

629
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,440
I'm sure he wouldn't want
to be a father.

630
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,120
What should I do?

631
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,960
Tell me.

632
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,160
Are you ready to be a mom?

633
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,520
I...

634
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,440
don't know.

635
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,520
Dee, we can't tell you
what to do, right?

636
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,400
Only you can decide that.

637
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,040
I don't know.

638
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,480
But listen, Dee...

639
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,760
we're with you no matter
what you decide.

640
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,040
And if you choose to have the kid,

641
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,840
it will have the best aunts in
the whole world!

642
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,240
Guaranteed.

643
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,040
Anj...

644
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,120
did you ever consider an abortion?

645
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,920
Actually, everything happened so soon.

646
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,600
Varun just proposed to me right there.

647
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:46,640
And now I cannot imagine
my life without Arya.

648
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,080
But, if Varun hadn't proposed to me...

649
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,760
maybe I would've considered it.

650
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,240
I am absolutely clueless.

651
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,680
You're going to be fine.

652
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,280
Everything's going to be fine.

653
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:25,280
Hello? Dr. Pandita,
this is Damini Rizvi Roy.

654
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,160
How soon can we schedule
the abortion procedure?

655
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,160
Thank you.
