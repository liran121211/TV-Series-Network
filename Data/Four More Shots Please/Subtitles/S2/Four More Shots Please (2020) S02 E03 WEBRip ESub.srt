1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,520
Sometimes we need Marie Kondo
in our lives.

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,680
You just have to get rid of the junk
you've created over the years.

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,600
No matter how much it hurts.

4
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,520
Sam, breakfast is ready.

5
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,800
We've got freshly cut mangoes.

6
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,360
And to top it off...

7
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,920
gluten free muesli
that too with almond milk.

8
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,640
Sam?

9
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,520
-Kale and mango. It's your favorite.
-No. Excuse me.

10
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,960
"Why don't people's hearts tell
them to continue to follow their dreams?

11
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,400
The boy asked the Alchemist.

12
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,800
Because that's what
makes a heart suffer most.

13
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,400
And hearts... don't like to suffer."

14
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,640
Baby, finish your milk quickly.

15
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,280
Mama's getting late for a meeting.

16
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,040
Mama, it's not hot-hot.

17
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,520
Baby, until last week
you refused to drink it hot!

18
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,120
-Shit!
-Mama said "shit."

19
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,440
Mama said "shit."

20
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,080
Oh, God. Radha! Finally!

21
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,920
Surprise! Coffee?

22
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,160
Surprise!
You're not Radha.

23
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,600
Arya!

24
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,160
Oh, God. I'm so late.

25
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,280
-Periods?
-Meeting.

26
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,840
And Radha hasn't shown up.

27
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,520
Listen, I can wait
with Arya till she comes.

28
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,600
-Are you sure?
-Wow!

29
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,600
-What is this? Of course.
-Are you sure?

30
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,080
-I owe you one.
-It's a building.

31
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,120
See.

32
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,120
More? More Lego?

33
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,160
My God.

34
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,320
-Bye.
-Bye, baby.

35
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,280
-Quickly.
-Give a kissy to Mama.

36
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,600
Have a good day.

37
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,000
Mama said "shit".

38
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,080
That's because she's constipated.

39
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,120
My mother started Ekalay
fifteen years ago in Solan

40
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,400
as a weaver cooperative.

41
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,280
She began with just nine women
from Solan and Chail.

42
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,840
And today, we have
seventy women working with us.

43
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,960
The weaves come directly
from these women.

44
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,840
Our designers then
transform it into wearable fashion.

45
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,520
50% of the profit goes
directly to the weaver co-op.

46
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,880
Oh, that's nice.

47
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,760
Anjana, if you take a look
at this design...

48
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,200
it is a traditional,
typical Himachali weave.

49
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,840
This was made by Nayantara Devi in 2010.

50
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,120
She's one of our finest weavers
and one of the first to come on board.

51
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,440
And now the multi billion
French fashion house Adalene SA...

52
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,360
has practically lifted the entire design.

53
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,480
Not to mention the color.

54
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,720
They are so shameless.
They haven't even...

55
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,800
Same color, same pattern,
same everything.

56
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,680
Yeah, look at it.

57
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,880
You can clearly say
this is not an inspiration.

58
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,640
They have plagiarized our design.

59
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,840
The designs look exactly the same.

60
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,480
Except for the fact that...
they're selling it for how much?

61
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,200
-Two thousand dollars.
-Wow!

62
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,240
I mean that's a lakh and a half.
Can you imagine?

63
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,240
We were selling it for what?

64
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,800
-We sold it for 4,000 rupees.
-4,000 rupees.

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,360
It's daylight robbery.

66
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,040
Look, we just want them to publicly
acknowledge their mistake

67
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,480
and apologize for their theft.

68
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,760
I mean, Nayantara should get her
due credit and compensation, right?

69
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,560
We cannot let them off the hook
so easily.

70
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,520
And that's why we've come to you, Anjana.

71
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,480
Your reputation precedes you.

72
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,680
Only you can win this case for us.

73
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,600
You are our last hope
and Nayantara's as well.

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,400
Can you please, please
take this case for us?

75
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,520
I'll see what I can do.

76
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,280
Pro bono.

77
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,640
Well, this is a law firm, Anjana.
Not an NGO.

78
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,040
But... there is something called
corporate social responsibility.

79
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,800
It's a straightforward case of plagiarism.

80
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,080
-Ekalay will win hands down.
-Is that so easy?

81
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,480
Adalene SA will arrive with forty of the
world's best lawyers.

82
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,440
And Ekalay will have just you.

83
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,240
Just me is good enough, Vinil.

84
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,240
I know I can win this case
because I believe in their cause.

85
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,600
Their cause. But their cause
doesn't pay for my Range Rover,

86
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,440
your kid's fee or your salon trips, ma'am.

87
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,760
Salon trips? Really?

88
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,800
Vinil, the media will be
all over this case

89
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,480
and our firm will benefit
from the publicity.

90
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,680
The firm? Or you?

91
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,040
Women are such bleeding hearts.

92
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,680
Probably that's why most CEOs are men.

93
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,120
Nearly 40% of Indian girls
are forced to

94
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,360
drop out of school or college
by their families.

95
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,800
Maybe that's why most CEOs are men.

96
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,760
If you say so.

97
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,920
Bye. Good night.

98
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,080
Cheers!

99
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,400
Are you serious?

100
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,160
And that gentlemen, was the
elephant in the room.

101
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,920
You know, it reminds me of
my time in Delhi.

102
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,280
Once...
Hey, Anjana.

103
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,520
Did I just walk into the men's
locker room by mistake?

104
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,560
Oh, come on!
I'll get you a drink.

105
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,560
No. I don't want to intrude on
your private party. I was just leaving.

106
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,200
I just assumed that all
the ladies had left

107
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,880
to get back home to their
husbands and children.

108
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,400
Come, I'll get you a drink.

109
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,360
Celebrate Vikram's promotion with us.

110
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,640
Promotion?

111
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,440
The official announcement
will happen tomorrow.

112
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,920
But Vikram is now a junior partner.

113
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,120
Cheers to Vikram!

114
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,160
Cheers, mate!

115
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,720
Have a drink.

116
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,400
No, thanks.
Can we just talk for a second?

117
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,640
Sure.

118
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,800
Vinil, Ratan had promised me
this promotion.

119
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,920
Ratan is in Singapore now.

120
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,240
I'm in charge here now and I felt
Vikram is better qualified.

121
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,480
But how?

122
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,360
I have been at this firm much longer.

123
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,800
I'm a senior associate.
He's a junior associate.

124
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,160
He has never worked with a big client.

125
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,360
He'll do it, Anjana.
He's got the potential.

126
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,200
Now, come on.
Pour yourself a drink.

127
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,120
So guys...

128
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,080
you know, I'm reminded
of this incident that happened...

129
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,800
Wow!

130
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,920
Arya baby, did you make this?

131
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,920
-Oh! Hi!
-Hi.

132
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,640
This Vinil plays it so smart.

133
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,120
In a way that no one can ever call him
out for his misogyny.

134
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,920
Such a bastard.

135
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,880
I'm seething with rage.

136
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,960
I... really don't know what to do.

137
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,800
Listen, Anj... don't worry.

138
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,080
You have the big clients anyway, right?

139
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,400
Like Titus Tech.
You got them to the firm.

140
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,360
You're way ahead of the Vikram, Anj.

141
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,720
Aren't you getting late?
Don't you need to get home?

142
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,640
Fuck, man!

143
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,520
I had to buy groceries for
Umang and Samara.

144
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,720
It's a full lock-down there.

145
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,640
Umang is not leaving Samara
for a minute.

146
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,280
Not even when she pees.

147
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,160
Listen, I don't want to leave you
like this.

148
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,400
Dee, you're wasting
all your effort and research.

149
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,160
Please go and work.

150
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,920
I don't know what's happened to me.

151
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,440
There's like a big fog in my brain.

152
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,560
What to do?

153
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,800
You're going to win a Pulitzer
for your procrastination.

154
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,800
Not for procrastination.
I'll get one for my book.

155
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,920
The one you're writing in Legoland?

156
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,840
-Hello?
-Damini.

157
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,000
Darling, it's Aparna Sahukar.

158
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,360
Long time.

159
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,760
I know, Aparna.

160
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,120
How are you?
Absolutely great.

161
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,720
And what about you?

162
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,880
How far have you reached with
your book?

163
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,320
You know about the book?

164
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,760
Everyone knows, darling.

165
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,160
And they also know that your book
will be just like you.

166
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,520
Absolutely sensational.

167
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,760
Thank you. Wow.

168
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,600
Before some other publisher
decides to kidnap you,

169
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,200
I thought I'd call you.

170
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,640
Promise me that you'll bring your
manuscript to Adelphi Books first.

171
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,320
Are you serious?

172
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,760
Oh, my God. Thank you so much!
Thank you!

173
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,440
I've known you since you were a child.

174
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,280
I feel like I have rights on your book.
And you!

175
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,480
Of course you do, Aparna.

176
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,200
Wow. I don't know what to say.
Thank you so much.

177
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,960
So then, I look forward to reading it.

178
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,400
And yes...

179
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,840
tell your mother I asked about her.

180
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,320
I will. Thank you.

181
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,480
I'll see you soon.

182
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,400
-Bye.
-Bye. Take care.

183
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,960
Samara, you have to learn to
talk about your feelings.

184
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,760
And Umang's here with you in
therapy today.

185
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,040
Would you like to tell her
how you feel?

186
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,080
Yeah.

187
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,520
So... Umang...

188
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,160
I'm...

189
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,760
I... I'm happy.

190
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,320
Samara, you don't look happy.

191
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,320
Are you taking your medication
on time?

192
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,240
Medication?

193
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,720
I have never seen you take
any medicines.

194
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,000
That's because I haven't been taking it.

195
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,360
But I've been giving you prescriptions
for three months.

196
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,880
I don't need them.

197
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,160
I'm doing yoga.
I'm meditating.

198
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,480
I'm... I'm eating well.

199
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,760
Not really.

200
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,080
Getting out of bed every morning
is tough on you.

201
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,520
I've seen you struggle.

202
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,280
Samara, you are
a high functioning bipolar.

203
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,960
And this isn't a recent development.

204
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,200
This has been the case
since you were 24.

205
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,520
You need these stabilizers.

206
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,040
No.
No, I'm not taking the pills.

207
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,600
Sam, it's fine.
We'll face them together.

208
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,360
I can't.

209
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,560
Okay, I have an idea.
Come.

210
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,000
Come on.

211
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,560
Jump.

212
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,120
Just jump.

213
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,480
Trust me.

214
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,280
Why didn't you tell me?
About bipolar or your pills?

215
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,480
I've been doing this on my own
too long.

216
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,880
I'm used to fighting my battles alone.

217
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,080
Sam...

218
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,280
battles can be fought alone but
you can't win them on your own.

219
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,160
If you want to win, you need an army.

220
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,440
I'm right here.

221
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,320
You've got this.

222
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,040
Just jump, Sam.
Come on!

223
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,160
Let's go.

224
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,680
Oh.

225
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,680
Come on.

226
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,000
One leg.

227
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,440
Hang on, hang on.

228
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,320
You have to come on me okay?

229
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,040
-Okay.
-Easy. Give me your hands.

230
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,880
Both your hands on my shoulders.

231
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,760
And slowly, legs down.

232
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,280
-Yeah, you got it.
-Yeah.

233
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,400
It's awesome.

234
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,720
Umang.

235
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,320
-Mama, Aunt Pookie ate a baby.
-What?

236
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,360
Dada said Aunt Pookie has a
baby in tummy.

237
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,720
Why she ate a baby, Mama?

238
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,720
Is it baby chicken?

239
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,440
But, why she ate baby chicken?

240
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,920
Dada said baby will kick.

241
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,880
We didn't want you to find out
this way.

242
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,160
We didn't want to tell anyone
till the first trimester.

243
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,040
I haven't even told my parents.

244
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,800
I've told mine, of course.

245
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,120
Yes.

246
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,360
Congratulations, guys!

247
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,080
This is the best news!

248
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,960
I'm so happy for you guys!
Oh, my God!

249
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,120
-Thank you!
-So happy!

250
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,040
Well done, tiger!

251
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,280
You never fire blanks.

252
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,840
Not that I care about Varun and
Kavya being pregnant.

253
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,720
I mean...

254
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,680
I'm not...

255
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,080
jealous or affected or something.

256
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,320
This was inevitable.

257
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,840
I don't want either.

258
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,000
Neither kids nor Varun.

259
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,920
Arjun actually wants to have
a family with me.

260
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,400
But I don't want it.

261
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,520
Are you not feeling bad?

262
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,360
I mean, he put his sperm inside
another womb.

263
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,000
And then he ejaculated kaboom!

264
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,000
You just made it sound so dirty!

265
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:28,080
Listen Anj, he came inside her without
protection while she was ovulating.

266
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,840
That dirty boy.

267
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,720
Anj, you know what I'm thinking?

268
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,320
Arya will have a sibling who will
look nothing like you.

269
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,120
Yes! But Arya's sibling will look
like Arya!

270
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,960
They will be a family while...
you'll be this aunt

271
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,640
who only gets invited to birthday parties.

272
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,120
And sometimes, out of pure sympathy, they
may take you on family Disneyland trips.

273
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,800
They'll shoot their boomerangs there!

274
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,400
And seeing them happy and at peace

275
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,360
Arjun will pressure you even more
to go kaboom inside you!

276
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,600
And guess who's going to become
a baby making machine again!

277
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,080
It will be this beautiful
yours and mine

278
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,800
and theirs and ours modern family.

279
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,400
How sweet, guys!

280
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,840
-Thank you so much!
-Anytime.

281
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,440
With friends like you,
I don't need enemies!

282
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,000
Hey, Hormonal Patel.

283
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,600
We need to talk.

284
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,400
Oh, my God!
What is your problem?

285
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,640
Are you a masochist?

286
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,480
You like being insulted?

287
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,440
Or have you fallen in
love with me?

288
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,840
I don't get it.

289
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,880
You want me to be a part of your shows?

290
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,760
Yes.

291
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,840
Have you completely forgotten
how I hammered you at your own show?

292
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,160
I uploaded that video on Instagram.

293
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,600
And my followers have gone crazy!

294
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,280
We're a hit, Hormonal!

295
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,280
Instagram followers?
All ten of them?

296
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,080
You'll be happy to know
that after uploading that video

297
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,400
I now have 2500 followers.

298
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,440
Congratulations but I'm not
a stand-up comic.

299
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,360
I'm a...

300
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,800
I'm a baker.

301
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,000
And a... a beauty blogger.

302
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,360
Wow!
How's that working out for you?

303
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,880
Wow.
How's puberty working out for you?

304
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,800
See! We have chemistry.

305
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,280
This is not chemistry.
This is hostility.

306
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,680
Every great love story
starts with conflict.

307
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,480
Every great love story
ends in tragedy.

308
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,320
Look, it's a regular gig.

309
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,640
I know you're a spoilt brat from
South Bombay.

310
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,560
But you'll get paid.

311
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,800
Paid?

312
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,400
You're telling me that people
pay to watch your show? Wow!

313
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,400
Offers like this don't come by every day.

314
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,960
Think about it.

315
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,640
Your hormones may finally
find some balance.

316
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,480
Arjun's actually just great with Arya.

317
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,480
They just get along.

318
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,760
-Dee, I need to pee.
-What?

319
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,320
-Anj!
-Two minutes.

320
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,760
So?

321
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,320
Are you and Japanese single malt
on a break?

322
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,200
I'm on a break with most things.

323
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,680
Where's Myra?

324
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,000
Family dinner.

325
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,280
She's pretty.

326
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,800
You look happy.

327
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,240
Yeah.

328
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,440
And yes, I...

329
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,920
I am.

330
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,440
Right.

331
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,680
How's the puppy doing?

332
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,320
He's no longer a pup.
He's a full grown bear now!

333
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,560
He's huge!

334
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,040
Look...

335
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,320
maybe we should have a chat sometime.

336
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,160
About how things ended.

337
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,800
Anj!

338
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,800
Getting late.

339
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,400
Book deadline, remember?

340
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,720
Yeah, of course.
Bye.

341
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,800
Bye, Jeh.

342
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,200
The two of you are completely useless!

343
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,800
If Mangs was here, she would have
immediately told me...

344
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,560
what I should do with my life.

345
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,640
How, when, why... everything!

346
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,520
Was that a compliment or an insult?

347
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,920
For us or for Mangs?

348
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,200
This is why you should
do this gig, Siddhi.

349
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,280
Even your insults make us crack up!

350
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,960
Listen Siddhu,
you have a real talent.

351
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,680
You're the funniest person
we know at least.

352
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,560
And that's what we were
talking about

353
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,960
when we called you cute and
sweet and...

354
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,000
-Adorable.
-Adorable.

355
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,920
What do you think?

356
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,640
Fine.

357
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,200
I've tried everything from classical
music to ballet with children. So...

358
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,520
I might as well give this a shot.

359
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,680
That's the spirit!

360
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,680
Yeah?

361
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,520
-Yes? Say it!
-Guys, I'm going to be a stand-up comic!

362
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,800
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

363
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,160
Stand-up comedy.

364
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,400
Really funny.

365
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,080
Where do you get these
ridiculous ideas from?

366
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,680
That's enough, Viju.

367
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,880
Stop taunting her.

368
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,160
Get over it.

369
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,240
I can't just get over it, Sneha.

370
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,240
What made her so insecure?

371
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,280
This girl has everything.

372
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,640
This house, chauffeur driven car,
foreign trips, credit cards.

373
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,400
In fact, she has too much.

374
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,320
So, she can't have any insecurities
because she's privileged.

375
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,520
Unless you're suffering from
some amnesia, you should remember...

376
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,800
that for all these years
you kept imposing...

377
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,560
your expectations and
judgments on Siddhi.

378
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,080
I was there for her.

379
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,040
So then, accept her now.

380
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,560
She was lost. She was vulnerable.
She made a mistake!

381
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,200
If she had problems,
she could've come to me.

382
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,440
Even rebellion has a limit!

383
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,520
This was not a rebellion, Viju.

384
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,880
This was Siddhi doing something
so she could finally accept herself.

385
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,880
If you gain weight, people will say...

386
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,160
"Oh poor Viju, he's working so hard.

387
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,000
He gets no time for himself."

388
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,160
But if I gain weight, they'll all say...

389
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,040
"She must sitting at home and
eating all day. Bloody fatso!"

390
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,480
People celebrate your work.

391
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,440
They applaud your success.

392
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,560
If a woman goes to work,
she's expected to work like

393
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,800
she has no family back home!

394
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,800
And if she stays home,
she has no time for anything else.

395
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,640
This is how we live.

396
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,520
And surprisingly, I didn't realize that
I had become a part of this system.

397
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,320
And made my daughter succumb
to it as well.

398
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,640
But I'm trying to make amends, Viju.

399
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,880
What are you doing?
As her best friend?

400
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,920
Are you angry that she did this thing

401
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,880
or are you upset she didn't tell
you she was doing it?

402
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,240
Make up your mind!

403
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,080
-Will you mail it to me so that I can...
-Sure.

404
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,680
-You have to put in all the changes--
-Anjana.

405
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,320
Mr. Singh. Mr. Khanna.

406
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,560
I didn't know our meeting was
scheduled for today.

407
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,320
Vinil Verma called us over personally.

408
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,920
Gentlemen, please.

409
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,080
Hi, Vinil Verma.

410
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,080
So happy to finally meet our
best clients.

411
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,240
-Titus Tech.
-Pleasure.

412
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,800
Lalwani & Jhunjhunwala
is grateful for your loyalty.

413
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,480
Ms. Menon has been our lawyer
for many years now.

414
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,560
-Where else could we go?
-Of course.

415
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,080
Come, please.
Let's talk in the conference room.

416
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,000
-Come.
-Please.

417
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,920
As you can see, Mr. Singh, this is the
new structure of your legal team

418
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,480
with Vikram leading the pack.

419
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,000
But Ms. Menon knows our case,
so we feel--

420
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,760
Yes, Mr. Singh, I assure you--

421
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,240
Actually, we're in the middle
of reshuffling the organization

422
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,080
and we thought that important
clients like you...

423
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,680
should have a bigger legal team.

424
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,200
Bigger team?

425
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,440
I have five lawyers.

426
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,320
They will stay on, Mr. Singh.

427
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,520
Don't worry.

428
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,960
What she means is that
we're vying for your subsidiaries as well.

429
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,080
With Vikram leading an even
bigger team.

430
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,920
-Vinil, I mean, this can be--
-Gentlemen, some tea, coffee?

431
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,200
Anjana, could you please organize
some refreshments?

432
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,040
So, Mr. Singh, as I was saying that
once this new team comes into place...

433
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,000
-Please go.
-Walk with them.

434
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:53,920
Yeah.

435
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,360
-Vinil.
-Yes, Anjana.

436
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,360
Vinil, Titus Tech is my client.

437
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,120
I brought them to this firm.

438
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,360
I am the lead lawyer on all
their cases.

439
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,080
You can't just wake up one day
and take it all away from me.

440
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,200
Watch your tone, Anjana.
You're sounding a tad bit desperate.

441
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,320
Since when is standing up for
oneself considered desperate Vinil?

442
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,160
This is the problem with women.

443
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,920
You'll get too emotional whereas men...

444
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,560
they're so much more clear and logical.

445
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,440
If I wasn't clear and logical

446
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,400
I wouldn't get promoted every year.

447
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,400
I brought Titus Tech and
Invictus Steel to this firm.

448
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,120
And they contribute to 25% of this
firm's billable hours.

449
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,640
And we want to take it to 50.

450
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,160
You have a daughter, right?

451
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,120
So?

452
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,800
You're a single mom, Anjana.
You won't be able to take on so much work.

453
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,480
You'll need to attend your child's
school function one day.

454
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,640
She might get sick.

455
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,960
I don't have time to deal with
your domestic issues.

456
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,320
No one in this firm has ever had
to deal with my domestic issues, Vinil.

457
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,880
My personal life
has never affected my work.

458
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,880
I have never shirked away
from long hours.

459
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,440
And just to let you know, I lead an
extremely balanced life.

460
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:58,320
I can handle my home, my work,
my daughter, my life, perfectly well.

461
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,880
Is that so?
Why couldn't you handle your marriage?

462
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,320
That is none of your business.

463
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,760
Everything is my business.

464
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,440
Even your time of the month.
Which I assume is right now.

465
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,760
Maybe that's why you're so hysterical.

466
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,040
How dare you!

467
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,360
How dare you judge me
based on my gender!

468
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,480
And how dare you question my
experience and judgment?

469
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,640
Lalwani & Jhunjhunwala have
given me free rein.

470
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,800
Free rein to be a misogynist.

471
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,600
They should be ashamed
to have hired you.

472
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,800
I've given ten years of my life
to this firm

473
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,560
and I'm not going to stand here and get

474
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,480
humiliated for all my hard work.

475
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,200
You will have my resignation tomorrow.

476
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,000
You can take your little boys club
and shove it.

477
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,320
You don't need them.

478
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,680
You can have any job you want.

479
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,360
I just can't believe the fucking
audacity of that guy.

480
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,080
I'm stressing out.

481
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,800
-Here.
-Home loan EMIs, Arya's school.

482
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,800
-Varun barely contributes.
-Hey.

483
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,320
Listen, you don't have to worry
about any of that stuff.

484
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,320
I'm here.

485
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,680
Look, until you don't find
another job, I'll...

486
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,640
I'll look after us.

487
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,320
I've been doing really well with
Poonawala Associates.

488
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,920
Trust me.

489
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,000
I know but you don't understand.

490
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,080
I don't need looking after.

491
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,920
I'm perfectly capable of looking
after myself and Arya. It's...

492
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,880
-It's just...
-I know, Anjana.

493
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,520
This is not my male ego talking.

494
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,480
I'm saying it because I'm...

495
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,840
I'm desperately in love with you.

496
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,200
But...

497
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,720
you don't love me.

498
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,720
Of course I do, Arjun.
Of course I love you.

499
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,160
-No! You don't.
-I do.

500
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,880
But I... can't give you what you want.

501
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,800
You want marriage and children.

502
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,640
I don't want these things again.

503
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,880
I've done enough of this.

504
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,960
My thirties are for me.

505
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,640
I know it sounds selfish but...

506
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,880
-but I think I deserve it.
-Okay.

507
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,280
All right. That's fine.

508
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,960
We won't get married.

509
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,840
We won't have children. Fine?

510
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,840
Is that okay?

511
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,200
Hear yourself, Arjun.

512
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,440
I can't do this to you.

513
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,400
I can't take away your dreams.

514
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,200
Can we please hit the brakes?

515
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,720
Why are we even talking
about these things?

516
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,920
I mean, you could change
your mind tomorrow. Right?

517
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,880
Sweetheart, listen to me.
I will wait.

518
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,720
Even if it means taking ten years.
I will wait.

519
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,080
Listen.

520
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,240
If we break up now...

521
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:12,240
we'll always love and respect each other.

522
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,560
Break up?

523
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,720
You mean...

524
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,120
No.

525
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,720
-What do you mean?
-You make me so, so, so happy.

526
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,560
So then, what's the problem?

527
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,240
-I shouldn't have...
-Just don't, please.

528
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,960
I should never have started this.

529
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,280
No. You did not start anything!

530
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,280
Okay? I did.

531
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,160
I started this.

532
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,240
-I pursued you.
-It doesn't matter.

533
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,080
It doesn't matter.
Please understand.

534
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,920
I love you so much.

535
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,680
-I know.
-So much.

536
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,800
I know.

537
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,480
I know.

538
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,360
Please don't break up with me.
Please.

539
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,040
I'm begging you.
I'm begging you. Please...

540
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,200
Please don't.

541
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,680
Please don't beg me.

542
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,200
One of us has to be strong.

543
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,040
I'm sorry.

544
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,120
I'm sorry.

545
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,640
I'm so sorry!

546
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,360
You don't get to do that.

547
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,600
I just love the detailing on this.

548
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,760
What does this mean to you?

549
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,080
Thank you for getting me
out of the house.

550
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,360
I was going insane.

551
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,200
One day, when you're done with
all the work in the house,

552
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,040
that's when you'll actually have to
start writing your book.

553
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,280
But this still doesn't mean
we're dating, okay?

554
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,360
Aamir?

555
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,120
Devyani, how are you?

556
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,840
-So nice to see you.
-Yes...

557
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,520
-This is Damini Rizvi Roy.
-Hi.

558
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,440
-Devyani.
-Hi.

559
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,400
Our families have been friends
for many years.

560
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,240
I dated him and he dated many women.

561
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,000
I'm a loyal puppy.

562
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,200
Right.

563
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,520
Your taste hasn't changed.

564
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,560
The smarter the woman, the better.

565
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,720
Aamir is a sapiosexual.

566
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,080
He finds intellectual stimulation
very hot.

567
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,440
Thank you, Devyani.

568
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,240
And when I broke up with my ex-husband,

569
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,400
he helped me.

570
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,440
Find myself.

571
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,600
We met at the gym.

572
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,160
We've run a few marathons also.

573
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,360
Some on the road, some in bed.

574
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,800
So many exes at one single party.

575
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,320
I wonder how many there
must be in real life.

576
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,520
But it's nice.
You're friends with all your exes.

577
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,200
Well, they're all lovely ladies, Damini.

578
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,880
And how many lovely ladies
are we talking about?

579
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,440
Nice try, tiger.

580
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,080
Tell me something.
Have you ever been in love?

581
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,360
No.

582
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,640
Have you?

583
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,920
Let's get drunk!

584
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,240
Let's!

585
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,760
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

586
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,760
Symptoms of Bipolar Disorder...

587
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,000
anxiety, hopelessness,

588
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,080
crying, anger...

589
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,160
No.

590
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,400
No! No!
I don't want these goddamn pills.

591
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,720
Sam, the doctor believes that...

592
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,440
The pills will help you.
I promise.

593
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,480
Help me do what?

594
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,920
Help me do what?
I've lost everything.

595
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,960
I've lost my life and my career and...

596
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,280
my friends. Everything.

597
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,400
Tell me honestly.

598
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,720
Why don't you want to get better?

599
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,080
Do you feel like you don't
have a purpose?

600
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,400
Sam.

601
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,880
I'm here. Your family's here,
your friends are here.

602
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,760
You're going to be okay.

603
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,600
Forget about everyone else.

604
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,880
Sam, look at me.

605
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,520
Look at me.

606
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,200
I'm here for you no matter
what, okay?

607
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,640
Can you get better for me?
For us?

608
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,560
Yes, baby?

609
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,360
The Judge Damodar case has taken
another sensational turn.

610
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,040
His entire family died in a
road accident this evening.

611
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,040
The police found the dead bodies
of his wife, son and daughter-in-law.

612
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,200
I can't stop crying.

613
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,080
That's because you love him, Anj.

614
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,720
Even he must be crying.

615
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,960
Go on. Make me feel more guilty!

616
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,120
Sooner or later, Arjun will realize
this was for the best.

617
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,800
I'm alone.

618
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,280
All over again!

619
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,640
And I am jobless.

620
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,520
Are you kidding?

621
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,680
Every law firm in Mumbai is going
to want you! Wait and watch.

622
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,520
We're here with you, Anj.

623
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,840
And now Mangs even has a plus one.

624
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,880
Guys, I know!

625
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,800
We'll all grow old together.

626
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,360
Move to a villa in Goa
and adopt lots of cats, dogs!

627
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,520
Wow. Our future is so bright.

628
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,400
Listen...

629
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,840
four hot oldies in Goa drinking shots.

630
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,240
Hell that's bright!

631
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,520
Come on.

632
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,640
You know what, guys?

633
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,680
I think no more law firms for me.

634
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,080
I'm going to go solo.

635
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,960
I'm going to fight Ekalay's case alone.

636
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,040
That's my girl!

637
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,360
-Are you scared?
-Shitting my pants!

638
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,000
Anyway, enough about me.

639
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:40,160
Dee, I saw the news about the
accident of Judge Damodar's family.

640
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,040
The whole family has been eliminated.

641
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,160
Fuck.

642
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,320
Thank God, I have those video interviews.

643
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,280
You know, I feel I'm the only one
who can get this story out now.

644
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,080
Dee, just go for it.

645
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,080
It's now or never.

646
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,080
You're right.

647
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,160
Even I've agreed to do that stand-up show.

648
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,440
How am I going to pull it off?

649
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,160
Probably lying down unconscious
or something!

650
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,720
Guys...
Mangs took the plunge, didn't she?

651
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,800
She went headlong into
this murky river of

652
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,880
sacrificing everything for love.

653
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,600
If she can do it, so can we.

654
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:21,240
Maybe it's time to take the steering
wheel, step on that accelerator...

655
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,640
-and drive that fucking car straight...
-Straight...

656
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,640
to the finish line.

657
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,360
I was going to say straight
off the cliff.

658
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,760
But straight to the finish line works too.

659
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,400
Guys...

660
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,640
come here.

661
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,880
I wish Mangs was here.
