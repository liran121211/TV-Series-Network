1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,440
I'm a woman on fire.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,040
Stop me if you can.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,480
But nobody can come in my way.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,080
Not even me.

5
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,440
Are you okay?

6
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,800
I finished the book.

7
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,520
I finished the book.

8
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,080
I finished the book!

9
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,520
I finished the book!

10
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,760
Now, what are the five words...

11
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,680
that can make any man

12
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,880
feel intimated?

13
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,280
Hint. It's not...

14
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,520
"Why is the towel on the bed?"

15
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,080
It's...

16
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,600
"What do women really want?"

17
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,160
Before my therapist becomes
a millionaire,

18
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,680
is there anyone over here who could
actually answer that question for me?

19
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,000
-Anyone?
-My cue.

20
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,440
You?

21
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,360
Me?

22
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,040
Ya, you look like somebody
who has all the answers.

23
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,520
I mean, you look like
you're really frustrated!

24
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,360
I'll clarify.
You look rather badass from up here.

25
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,360
Will you join me on stage, please?

26
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,840
-Yes. Yes!
-Ya?

27
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,440
Guys, give her a cheer.

28
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,880
-Guys!
-Siddhi!

29
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,080
Hi.

30
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,560
I clearly seem to have
this effect on women.

31
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,000
So, what's your name?

32
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,440
Siddhi Patel.

33
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,440
Siddhi...

34
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,880
will you please tell all of us...

35
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,120
what do women

36
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,440
really want?

37
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,960
Equal pay?

38
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,080
Go, girl!

39
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,200
Alright!

40
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,840
Okay, okay. I hear you.

41
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,400
All you kids in the audience,
shut your ears, please...

42
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,480
because I'm going to drop the "F" word.

43
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,160
Are you... a feminist?

44
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,120
Why are you saying it like it's an insult?

45
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,920
No. I mean, feminism is slightly
confusing, right?

46
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,360
Should I...
hold the door open for you?

47
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,320
Or you're independent and
you'd rather do it on your own?

48
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,400
You know, I don't...
I find this really funny.

49
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,480
For thousands of years, the men
have been closing all the doors on us.

50
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,880
But in the name of chivalry...

51
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,400
But in the name of chivalry, opening
one door gives them feminist burns.

52
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,000
I think it's pretty simple.

53
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,160
If I'm standing in front of you,
I'll open the door for you.

54
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,960
If you're standing in front of me,
feel free to open the door for me.

55
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,320
I have another question.

56
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,600
Say we're out on a date.

57
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,640
And I get you a drink.

58
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,960
I don't even know you.

59
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,200
How can you assume
I'll go on a date with you?

60
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,080
I mean...
#absurdlyforward

61
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,640
Okay. Let me rephrase that.

62
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,080
I ask you out.
You happen to say "yes".

63
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,440
I get you a drink.

64
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,240
What do I get in return?

65
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,560
A GST bill?

66
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,920
-Hey, Damini...
-Hi...

67
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,160
Here. This is yours.

68
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,760
I can't tell you how much
I've been waiting for this.

69
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,720
Ya?

70
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,920
You'll love it, Shridhar.
I mean, I hope you love it.

71
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,040
I'll definitely read it.

72
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,320
Thank you. I'm really looking
forward to reading this.

73
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,880
I'm really looking forward
to reading this.

74
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,640
Thank you.
Bye.

75
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,480
Take care. Bye.
Thank you.

76
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,920
May the publishing bids pour in!

77
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,440
And may Dee get justice
for the Judge and his family.

78
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,080
And may those idiots at Investigator
regret all their decisions.

79
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
-To Judge Damodar.
-Yeah!

80
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,680
-May truth prevail. Always.
-Always!

81
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,640
-What's going on?
-Mangs!

82
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,040
Congrats, Dee.
You guys, I'm sorry but I need to leave.

83
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,200
Mangs, are you insane?
It's not even eight o'clock!

84
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,440
There's no bloody curfew, you know!

85
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,360
I know.

86
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,640
But I can't leave
Samara alone for this long.

87
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,920
Even when Arya was three months,

88
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,720
I didn't have so many restrictions.

89
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,880
Please, Mangs.
We miss you.

90
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,840
I miss you guys, too.
Just a few more days.

91
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,760
I'm taking her to a yoga and
meditation center tomorrow.

92
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,200
Mangs...

93
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,320
how are you coping with this whole thing?

94
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,400
-Are you okay?
-Ya.

95
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,240
I'm good.

96
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,720
I'm assuming you're aware of the
giver-receiver theory.

97
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,920
Sometimes the giver gives so much...

98
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,200
that they end up empty from within.

99
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,640
Sorry. Sorry.

100
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,840
Congratulations.

101
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,440
Umang tells me you've
finished the book.

102
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,000
Yes, I finally did.

103
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,960
Thanks.

104
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,280
Weren't you going somewhere?

105
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,720
You're the one who's
always going somewhere.

106
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,520
Okay. Sorry.

107
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,800
Please. You first.

108
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,200
No. You first.

109
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,560
Why don't I just go through?

110
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,720
And Jeh, when you're done here...

111
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,080
the ice-delivery guy is waiting
for his cheque.

112
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,240
Of course.

113
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,320
I don't think Myra likes me at all.

114
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,760
Why does she need to?

115
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,680
Jeh...

116
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,840
Do you still...

117
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,160
like me?

118
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,520
Damini, I'm holding two crates

119
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,120
and my ice-delivery guy is waiting for me.

120
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,800
Not exactly the right
time to have this conversation.

121
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,480
-Hold on a second, please.
-Oh!

122
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,600
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

123
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,720
What floor?

124
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,200
-The same.
-Okay.

125
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,040
Lift! Lift! Lift!

126
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,080
-Sorry, what floor?
-Six.

127
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,000
Okay.

128
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,560
Not even a thank you.
Courtesy is dead.

129
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,240
Fuck.

130
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,040
Oh, Lord! Elevator rides are everything
they're cracked up to be!

131
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,320
I think I cracked
my jaw laughing so hard!

132
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,640
He didn't even crack a smile back there!

133
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,840
-Maybe you should've cracked a joke!
-Maybe I should have.

134
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,880
-Have a good day.
-You too.

135
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,600
-Morning, sir.
-Morning, morning.

136
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,640
Bose and Agarwal?

137
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,360
Ma'am, that way.

138
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,520
-Good morning, sir.
-Morning.

139
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,160
Hi, Mr. Shashank Bose?

140
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,480
Please go ahead.

141
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,360
We have all the documents with us here?

142
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,160
I want to be out of here before lunch.

143
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,120
Alright?

144
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,520
Ms. Menon?

145
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,160
Mr. Bose?

146
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,080
That's right. Shashank Bose.

147
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,840
Leading lawyer for Adalene SA.

148
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,200
What a pleasure it was to meet you.

149
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,280
Likewise, Mr. Bose.

150
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,880
How does it feel to be
fighting against such a tiny co-operative?

151
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,040
An idealist in today's
day and age?

152
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,120
Well, without the idealists,
the world would come to an end.

153
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,240
Am I right, Mr. Bose?

154
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,000
You're a poet, too?

155
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,880
Sometimes.

156
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,000
To take my mind off perpetrators
of injustice like your clients.

157
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,600
Perpetrators of injustice?

158
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,400
Please.

159
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,000
Are you a lawyer or a judge?

160
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,400
Let the case begin.

161
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,640
And we'll know soon enough who
is being used for publicity.

162
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,640
Ekalaya is a fifteen year
old co-operative, Mr. Bose.

163
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,200
Why would they need publicity?

164
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,160
Well, in that case, Adalene is
a 75 year old company

165
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,280
formed by a seamstress in a studio
apartment in Paris post World War II.

166
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,760
What on earth would they
need Ekalaya for?

167
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,880
Since we're time-traveling
into the past, Mr. Bose,

168
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,280
then the weaving traditions of Kullu and
Kinnaur go back thousands of years.

169
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,080
Well, in that case,
the French fashion industry...

170
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,320
goes way back in time too.

171
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,120
In fact, they invented the word couture.

172
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,160
-Am I saying it right?
-Yes.

173
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,080
And it's the same French fashion industry,

174
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,640
who like the Brits,

175
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,640
sold all the cotton, silk,
and indigo of the world to earn profits.

176
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,520
And owing to their technology,

177
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,000
the fashion industry continues to survive
in many third-world nations.

178
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:12,960
Yes, that's true.

179
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,400
Like the sweat shops in India,
Nepal and Bangladesh.

180
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,880
Big fan, Ms. Menon.

181
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,960
Loved how you defended the
defamation cases against Tech Corp.

182
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,360
As am I, Mr. Bose.

183
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,480
Loved your work for
Pilots' Union against Nebula Airlines.

184
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,520
Ya, I was pretty good.

185
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,840
So, should we...

186
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,520
crack this case open?

187
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,720
Yes.

188
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,120
Shall we?

189
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,520
People will recognize me.

190
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,200
Celebrities come here all the time.

191
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,480
No one's going to even bother about you.

192
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,000
Literally, nobody cares.

193
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,680
Let's go.

194
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,400
Umang's reality shot.

195
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,400
Brings you right back down to earth.

196
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,800
-Greetings.
-Hello.

197
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,880
Welcome to our spa.
We're delighted to have you.

198
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,880
-Please follow me.
-Delighted to be here.

199
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,880
This is our Yoga pavilion.

200
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,000
We conduct three classes
of Ashtanga Yoga everyday.

201
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,960
And every morning,
you'll get your wheatgrass shot...

202
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,640
along with your daily itinerary.

203
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,440
Wheat grass is my favorite shot.

204
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,920
After tetanus, of course.

205
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,680
Okay, every morning, I need my cleanser.

206
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,200
Flax seeds, chia seeds and goji berries.

207
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,720
Also Leh berries,
hemp seeds and acai berries

208
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,120
and some baobab.

209
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,760
She has a pooping problem.

210
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,800
Don't worry, ma'am.

211
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,120
Her bowels are our responsibility now.

212
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,000
-Absolutely.
-Good.

213
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,720
It's so good to have a friend
who is this considerate.

214
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,200
Actually...

215
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,320
Umang is my girlfriend.

216
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,760
Okay.

217
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,480
Let me take you to your room?

218
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,400
-Sure. Take us.
-Okay, follow me.

219
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,880
Wow.

220
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,960
Okay, then.

221
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,040
Authors and publishing types
make me nervous.

222
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,040
-You better not abandon me.
-You better not abandon me.

223
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,640
You're my wing woman tonight.

224
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,920
I mean today.

225
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,560
I don't see no one I know.

226
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,600
-Should we get a drink?
-Should we get a drink?

227
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,880
-Stop laughing so loud!
-Sorry.

228
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,440
Shit! Bose!

229
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,200
-Adalene's lawyer.
-Where?

230
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,360
Blue suit. White shirt.

231
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,480
You sure he's a lawyer?
And not a poster boy?

232
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,720
Dee, please stop it.

233
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,280
I work with him. I mean, against him.

234
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,480
-I mean, you know what I mean?
-I don't know what you mean.

235
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,000
Aparna!

236
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,080
Aparna!

237
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,920
Hi! How are you?

238
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,000
So nice to see you!
My friend, Anjana.

239
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,080
-Hi.
-Aparna.

240
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,000
Hello.

241
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,640
I'm so glad you came.

242
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,640
Of course, I had to.
After the very personal invitation.

243
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,280
Listen...

244
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,640
did you read the manuscript?

245
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,720
Damini! It's a party!

246
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,960
-Shall we talk later?
-Okay.

247
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,400
Why don't you and your friend
go and get yourselves a drink?

248
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,840
Go on. Enjoy the party!

249
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,440
Thank you.

250
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,920
Now what?

251
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,560
That's Shridhar Nair of Phoenix Books.

252
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,240
Shridhar!
Hi!

253
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,160
-Okay.
-I don't know what's going on.

254
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,520
Hey. Menaka.

255
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,320
-Hi.
-Hi.

256
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,360
How are you?

257
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,280
Great.

258
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,480
I'm great, Damini.

259
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,160
Did you read the book or...

260
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:54,960
couldn't find the time?

261
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,240
You know, seriously...

262
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,120
I'm snowed under a lot of work.

263
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,160
Right.

264
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,680
But I'll get to it soon. Ya?

265
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,400
Is it just me or is this party
really frigid?

266
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,800
Minus twenty five degrees.

267
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,320
Feels like we're in Antarctica.

268
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,840
-What are you doing!
-Just making sure.

269
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,520
Hey.

270
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,840
Listen, will you stay here
for two minutes?

271
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,840
I'll just go talk to her.

272
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,840
What the hell is going on, Aparna?

273
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,840
Why is everyone ignoring me?

274
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,960
I'm sorry, Damini.

275
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,120
Perhaps, I shouldn't have invited you.

276
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,280
Why?

277
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,720
No one's going to publish
your book, Damini.

278
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,400
No one can publish it...

279
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,280
and they're too
embarrassed to tell you that.

280
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:44,960
Is it that bad?

281
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,800
It's just the first draft, I promise.

282
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,440
I am going to work
with the editor, you know...

283
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,440
No!

284
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,280
It's not that.

285
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,160
It's just that...

286
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,120
It's a great book.

287
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,560
It's powerful, it's well researched,
it's gripping.

288
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
In fact, it's the best book
I've read in years.

289
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,120
Then, what's the problem?

290
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,160
It's too controversial, Damini.

291
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,000
And in this current
political environment,

292
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,080
to publish this kind of a book...

293
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,200
is a massive risk.

294
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,680
It implicates a lot of powerful people
in the government.

295
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,640
They could shut us down.

296
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,400
People's lives will be at risk.

297
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,440
No one's going to touch it, Damini.

298
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,960
No one.

299
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,360
Judge Damodar lost his life
for the truth, Aparna.

300
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,800
Exactly.

301
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,840
The truth comes at a very high price.

302
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,080
Scared cowards.

303
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,480
Government puppets.

304
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,960
Capitalist slaves.

305
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,280
Wow.
So much anger.

306
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,440
-Hi!
-Hi.

307
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,920
I sympathize with you.

308
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,840
This boring party...

309
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,200
can make anyone angry.

310
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,800
Seriously!
From right wing-left wing disputes...

311
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,960
to Trump's governance and...

312
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,920
There is a ready opinion
on everything here.

313
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,360
On everything!

314
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,200
From the coal mining in Dhanbad...

315
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,240
to the best wine from Napa Valley--

316
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,680
To the Saudi dictatorship...

317
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,360
-It's like surfing Snapchat for...
-For generation X!

318
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,920
-Exactly.
-It is!

319
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,280
Like...

320
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,640
Hi.

321
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,560
I'm Damini.

322
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,200
Sorry, that's Damini.

323
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,240
And that's Mr. Bose.

324
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,320
Nice to meet you, Damini.

325
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,360
I am Shashank Bose.

326
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,440
Anjana's newest nemesis,

327
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,880
foe, adversary.

328
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,280
-Maybe even an arch enemy?
-Oh, c'mon!

329
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,520
Nice to meet you too, Mr. Bose.

330
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,560
Wait a minute.
This is blasphemous!

331
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,280
Don't tell me they conned you into these
lame-ass champagne martinis!

332
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,920
Is this the point where you'll suggest
the real martini...

333
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
we should be drinking?

334
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,920
Of course! That's what I'm here for.

335
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,640
Excuse me.
Hi.

336
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,520
Two dry gin martinis, please.

337
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,480
A wash of vermouth and
olives on the side.

338
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,080
Ladies.

339
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,560
What was that?

340
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,920
What was what?

341
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,680
Fireworks, lights, heat.

342
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,960
Dee, he's married.

343
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,320
That's his wife right there.

344
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,200
Sushmita Sengupta is his wife?

345
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,440
Ya.

346
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,720
She's a power broker.

347
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,080
The CEO of West Comm.

348
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,320
If you keep staring at her like that,

349
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,320
she might just spontaneously combust.

350
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,560
Don't be ridiculous.

351
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,440
There was a fire burning here

352
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,760
about a minute ago.

353
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,680
And it wasn't because of me.

354
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,520
Are you crazy?
I just told you he's married and...

355
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,400
I broke up with Arjun
like a month ago?

356
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,680
So, have some shame.

357
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,080
Sure. If you say so.

358
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,160
But...

359
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,400
you didn't say no to him
for a drink.

360
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,800
I drink once a week.

361
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,720
Might as well make it a good one, right?

362
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,560
-Right. Cheers to that.
-Cheers!

363
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,400
What's going on, Hormonal?

364
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,760
All by yourself today.

365
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,800
Ya, my friends are all busy.

366
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,920
Are you nervous without them?

367
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,760
Not one bit.
I am the real Lady Gaga.

368
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,400
I'm used to going up on stage and
performing for a crowd.

369
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,200
Chill. I was just showing concern.

370
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,920
-Shit. I forgot. Seven times four...
-What are you doing? Vocal exercise?

371
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,480
No. Just babbling the
tables of seven.

372
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:18,960
Friendly advice.

373
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,080
Never bring math into the equation.

374
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,920
Did you get it?

375
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,320
Nice one.

376
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,800
If Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers,

377
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,200
where's the peck of pickled peppers,
Peter Piper picked?

378
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,280
What the fuck is that?

379
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,320
If Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers,

380
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,800
where's the peck of pickled peppers,
Peter Piper picked?

381
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,680
Say it.

382
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,080
If Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers.

383
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,080
Where's the peck of pickled peppers,
Peter Piper picked?

384
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,960
Where's the peck of pickled peppers,
Peter Piper picked?

385
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,560
-Simple.
-Ya. Now faster.

386
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,920
If Peter Patter...
Shit! Sorry. Wait.

387
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,800
If Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers,

388
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,640
-where's the peck of pickled peppers...
-Peter Piper picked?

389
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,720
If Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers...

390
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,800
Okay, so now...

391
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,920
I'm going to be needing a
volunteer from the audience.

392
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,080
You!

393
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,560
I have so much time to waste that
I'm here watching your stupid show.

394
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,520
Tell me. What do you need?

395
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,880
I don't know.
A magic show?

396
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,720
I can make those sides disappear.

397
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,920
Wow.

398
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,760
Why don't I make you disappear?

399
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,800
#bodyshamer

400
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,400
#terribleterriblejoke

401
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,800
Why don't you raise
the standard of your show?

402
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,160
I'm not that good a magician yet.

403
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,560
Wait. What?

404
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,800
You're not a magician?

405
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,720
Which means you haven't
hypnotized these people?

406
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,800
You're trying to tell me that

407
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,080
all these people here are voluntarily
watching your rotten show!

408
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,920
Only a rotten crowd will
watch a rotten show.

409
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,560
That was a joke, guys!

410
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,400
So are you going to join me or not?

411
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,520
Nope.

412
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,960
Just going to shout insults
at you from here.

413
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,160
Way more fun.

414
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,960
No one is brave enough
to take on the government.

415
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,680
Everyone's scared shitless.

416
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,960
You know what. Fuck them.

417
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,320
I'll go indie.

418
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,240
The big boys don't have the guts.

419
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,640
Maybe the indie publishers will.

420
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,640
I'll give them a book that will
take them mainstream.

421
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,080
No?

422
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,160
Who do you think are the...

423
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,040
best indie publishers?

424
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,960
I still can't believe how entitled
these big guys are.

425
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,000
What?

426
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,440
Big City Books, Bombastic Publications.

427
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,280
Millennial Books.

428
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,160
Why does the word "millennial"
feature everywhere?

429
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,720
Hey, look at this.

430
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,560
Yuvanta.

431
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,520
That young writer Rana Sen?
Whose book was banned?

432
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,720
They've published it.

433
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,080
You should try them.

434
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,760
Stop being so nice and helpful.

435
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,320
Why?

436
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,320
Because you're making my lady parts

437
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,560
grow less lustful and more loving.

438
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,160
The vagina doesn't do that.

439
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,960
The brain does.

440
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,800
Thanks, doctor.

441
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,520
Put this away.

442
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,720
Come here.

443
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,320
So this Sumit...

444
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,440
Is he handsome?

445
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,040
Amit, Mom.

446
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,960
The two of you work together.

447
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,000
There must be some chemistry.

448
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,760
Mom, please. Don't start your
matchmaking again.

449
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,880
Why are you so rigid?

450
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,080
Excuse me, ma'am.
We are ready for you.

451
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,800
I'm having the deep tissue and
she's having the full body wax.

452
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,240
What?
Why?

453
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,480
One must always be prepared.

454
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,480
Ready.

455
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,120
Ma'am, please take off your robe,
underwear and lie down.

456
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,360
Underwear?

457
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,760
What the hell was that, Mom!

458
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,880
It was worse than dental pain!

459
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,680
And why do I have to look like a
bloody Chihuahua down there!

460
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,680
Your friends are all modern women.

461
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,200
Have they never told you
to get a Brazilian wax?

462
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,840
That's how men like it.

463
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,720
If they like it
then they should only do it.

464
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,040
You know when you become...

465
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,640
-When you start doing it...
-Oh, my God.

466
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,200
Siddhi, I want to be
your friend now, darling...

467
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,920
That's why I'm being frank.

468
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,240
When you become sexually active,

469
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,240
you have to cater to the
sexual fantasies of your partner.

470
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,280
Okay bye, Mom. I'm done.

471
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,640
Your body is not your own anymore.

472
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,520
Mom!

473
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,320
My body will always be mine.

474
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,560
Thank you very much.

475
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,080
In fact, we don't ask the men
to get Brazilians!

476
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,080
Fine. But if he doesn't get
what he wants at home,

477
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,080
he'll go looking for it
outside the house.

478
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,840
Very good. If he does that,
he can also get out of the house.

479
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,920
If only it was that simple, Siddhi.

480
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,720
It's not that difficult either, Mom.

481
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,560
Cross the Sea Link.
Get to Bandra Court.

482
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,360
You'll have six months of waiting period.
And that's it.

483
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,880
Divorce granted.
Done.

484
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,120
This stand-up comedy is making you
a little too frisky.

485
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,680
I just think that why should only men
have these sexual fantasies?

486
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,240
Women also have a right to them.

487
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,520
Tell me, Mom.

488
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,680
What's your sexual fantasy?

489
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,080
Stop it, Siddhi.

490
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,960
-Why?
-Stop it!

491
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,440
-Aren't we friends?
-Go away!

492
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,320
Did you just fart?

493
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,000
No.

494
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,240
I think it's him.

495
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,240
You know...

496
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,640
when you fart, do it freely.

497
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,120
Notice that?

498
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,480
That bald guy's head...

499
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,360
Doesn't it remind you of a rasgulla?

500
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,120
I'm craving one!

501
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,880
Damn!

502
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,920
Are you craving it?

503
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,240
Or him?

504
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,000
Are you swinging back
the other way?

505
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,400
Never.

506
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,720
I'm also craving pizza.

507
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,520
I'm ravenously hungry
after ages!

508
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,840
What kind of hunger?

509
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,240
You know, life is really fucked up.

510
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:45,960
Isn't it?

511
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,640
The day's most profound thought.

512
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,760
Brought to you by
Her Holiness Samara Kapoor.

513
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,400
But it's not just life
that's fucked up, right?

514
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,600
People are fucked up too.
Look at me.

515
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,640
What about you?

516
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,360
Race you to the top?

517
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,240
-Ya. Okay!
-C'mon.

518
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,520
-Ready. Set. Go!
-Go!

519
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,640
-C'mon! No cheating! Let's go!
-Go!

520
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,120
-Faster! Faster!
-C'mon!

521
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,600
Faster!

522
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,320
-Such a cheater.
-I know you can do it!

523
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,800
You know, Yuvanta Books is exactly the
kind of home I want for Bloody February.

524
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,640
The kind of work you're publishing,
it's so brave.

525
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,960
So out there, so avant-garde.

526
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,200
You understand political writing.

527
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,000
I loved Rana Sen's book.

528
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,640
Got banned though.

529
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,440
I know but that was explosive stuff.

530
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,160
Damini, I'm a huge fan of your work.

531
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,600
I used to follow all your stories
on Investigator.com.

532
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,240
Just...

533
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,240
it was so awful what they did to you.

534
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,120
True but...

535
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,680
Were it not for that, I wouldn't be here.

536
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,160
Never would've written this book.

537
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,080
True. True.

538
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,600
So...

539
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,160
What are you writing next?

540
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,040
Shall we discuss Bloody February first?

541
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,240
Sure. Sure.

542
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,960
I mean, don't get me wrong, Damini.

543
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,560
I would love to read it.
In fact, I can't wait to read it.

544
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,480
But...

545
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,400
I can't publish it.

546
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,320
Why not?

547
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,160
After Rana's case,
we're already on the radar.

548
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:23,080
If I publish another controversial book,
I'll be out of business.

549
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,920
I can't afford that.

550
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,760
Sorry.

551
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,120
And good luck.

552
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,800
This book will be published.

553
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,720
Read it on Kindle.

554
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,400
It'll be cheaper than the hard copy.

555
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,920
Thank you for your time, Zara.

556
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,720
I don't think you're getting me.

557
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,720
Let me get this right.

558
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,120
Ekalaya produced this fabric
ten years back?

559
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,600
Correct.

560
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,120
So, in 2020, how can a designer sitting
all the way out in Paris

561
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,080
steal a design that's ten years old?

562
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,040
There are design archives.

563
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,200
He must have seen it on the internet.

564
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,400
Or on one of his trips to India.

565
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,360
There are numerous possibilities.

566
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,480
My client is innocent.
This is pure coincidence.

567
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,880
My client is right.
This is pure plagiarism.

568
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,720
We'll see about that. I'm not going
to back down from this, Anjana.

569
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,120
I wouldn't want you to back down.

570
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,440
Good to know.

571
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,400
I meant, we both need
to bring our A game.

572
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,400
That's the only way
this battle will be fun.

573
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,640
Fun to fight...

574
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,560
Ya.

575
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,400
It's getting late for the day.

576
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,560
You think we should adjourn maybe?

577
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,160
Yes. That's a good idea.

578
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,600
-Thanks for coming in.
-Thank you. Thank you.

579
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,200
Yes! I mean, I do prefer the lawns mowed.

580
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,600
But my question is,
there are lawns on both sides.

581
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,920
So why should only one gender
have to mow it?

582
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,080
Because its trickier for us men, right?

583
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,640
What if something else gets mowed instead?

584
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,480
Imagine if the hair gets stuck
in my trimmer!

585
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,920
But that's not fair.

586
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,560
Why should only women have to
endure the hot burning wax?

587
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,720
Because it's easier to find
the hot spots?

588
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:10,200
Please! You shouldn't even bother.
It's just not your cup of tea.

589
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,800
Even if boys move
around with Google Maps,

590
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,960
there's little hope of them
finding the hotspots!

591
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,200
I get it.
I'm twenty seven.

592
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,640
And even today, if I shave, I'll
probably look like a fourteen year old.

593
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,840
I'm still asked to flash
my ID at nightclubs.

594
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,320
Not exactly tall, dark, handsome
and desirable. I accept that.

595
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,640
You're not that bad.

596
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,960
Wait. Are you saying you're interested?

597
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,880
No.

598
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,560
Thank you, guys!
You've been a lovely audience!

599
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,720
Have a great night!

600
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,640
Oh my God!

601
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,160
-That was amazing!
-Amazing!

602
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,680
That was like the best show ever!

603
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,400
I can't believe our fifth show
is an actual blockbuster!

604
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,680
Do you realize we're like a
legit super hit pair?

605
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,000
Like Varun-Alia, Ross and Rachel,
Chuck and Blair and Amit and Siddhi!

606
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,440
I'm sorry.

607
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,880
I completely read that wrong.

608
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,400
I'm sorry. Can we just pretend
that never happened?

609
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,640
Please?

610
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,440
Don't be awkward.

611
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,520
I'm sorry.
I just misread the situation completely.

612
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,440
It's... it's fine.

613
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,680
You're a great girl. I like you.

614
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,920
Right.

615
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:46,720
And... you don't like me
which is completely fine.

616
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,440
Wow. I'm such an idiot.

617
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,400
Can we just go get a drink and
pretend like this never happened?

618
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,360
Ya? Can we please do that right now?

619
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,600
Amit, I was just...

620
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,360
I was just taken by surprise.

621
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,520
I mean, I had no clue that you...

622
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,320
you know...

623
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,800
C'mon, Sam.
Ten thousand steps today.

624
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,480
Keep it up!

625
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,840
What's happening?

626
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,320
I'm ready to take the pills.

627
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,520
Are you sure?

628
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,280
I am.

629
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,480
I want to get better.

630
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,760
I'm tired of feeling
that something's wrong and...

631
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,840
tired of feeling scared
and like I'm not good enough.

632
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,320
I want to do this.

633
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,000
For you, for me, for us.

634
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,920
Ya.

635
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,920
Sounds like a good plan to me.

636
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,960
But you know we still have to do the
ten thousand steps right?

637
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,200
You still have to run. All right?

638
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,440
Ten thousand steps!
You don't get off that easy.

639
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,720
C'mon! Let's go!

640
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,040
Like this. Keep it up! Let's go!
Just till there. Right there.

641
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,760
-Just shut up. Just hug me!
-Okay.

642
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,160
What's wrong?

643
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,360
Nothing.

644
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:53,960
You just...

645
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,040
you look beautiful
when you sleep.

646
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,520
Oh!

647
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:01,000
Okay then, I'll go back to sleeping
so you can look at me.

648
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,840
Really?

649
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,440
Do you like my sexy, sleeping vest?

650
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,120
Or my...

651
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,400
striped boxers?

652
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,840
Don't I look like a
prisoner on the run?

653
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,520
Like totally irresistible?

654
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,920
No?

655
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,800
How dare you laugh in
my prison, woman!

656
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,320
Come here. I'm going to punish you
for your bad behavior.

657
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,680
I have no clue what you said but...

658
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,200
I really like the way that you said it.

659
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,320
Is that so?
