00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,520
Previously on season one of
Four More Shots Please!

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,960
The board has started
censoring my stories.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,360
Scared of some fucking law suits,
little sissies.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,960
Sneha put me on Keto again.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,200
So, no rice,
no sugar, no bread, no life.

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,120
There's someone called Kavya.

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,480
Varun is apparently
very serious about her.

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,320
I yelled at THE Samara Kapoor
in the gym today.

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,760
And then I kept saying,
"Sorry, it's okay, it's okay.",

10
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,120
like it's some
new Punjabi pop-track.

11
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,640
I mean, what a fucked up week, man!

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,560
She spent the night or what?

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,400
"She spent the night or what?"

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,320
No, she didn't.

15
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,760
When will she get married?

16
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,720
The board needs to grow a pair of balls
if they want to be in the news business.

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,680
Only you can train me.

18
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,720
I haven't had sex since Arya was born.

19
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,680
Anj...

20
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,960
Arya's almost four.

21
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,680
When I listen to your rants,
I feel like I'm home.

22
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,040
And that all is well with the world.

23
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,160
I can't live with someone.

24
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,240
I can't live without someone.

25
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,080
I'll give you an idea
that will change your life.

26
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,080
What?

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,560
That's not how Aunt Kavya makes it.

28
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,480
My team here is crime
and political reporters.

29
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,360
They don't do this shit.

30
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,160
This... is what's going to put
money in their salary accounts.

31
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,160
Siddhi... I really like the sound of this.

32
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,440
Siddhi weds Mohit.

33
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,640
Mohit is gay.

34
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,920
It's because of low IQ dumbos like you...

35
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,640
that we have to print cheap gossip.

36
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,720
You are the one who
is fucking moving on.

37
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,760
Making a happy family and home-sweet-home

38
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,920
and all that fucking bullshit.

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,240
Why don't you move on as well?

40
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,200
He chose men over you!

41
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,480
Shut up! Just shut up, Sneha!

42
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,240
Arjun!

43
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,840
Vagina!

44
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,840
The problem is, you know what you want,

45
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,080
but you don't know what you need.

46
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,040
That was so fucking hot.

47
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,640
I like you too, Damini Rizvi Roy.

48
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,600
This is my first
relationship with a woman.

49
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,360
-I am not even sure if I am--
-If I am what?

50
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,760
I've given my life to Investigator.com.

51
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,840
My everything!
You cannot remove me!

52
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,360
-Oh, my God.
-I am sorry...

53
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,360
-Will you marry me?
-Say yes!

54
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,800
Sids, what's wrong?

55
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,400
If you weren't so distracted,
I would still have my fucking company.

56
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,760
That's what happens when you sleep
with just one person your entire life.

57
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,840
At least I'm not sleeping around
with the whole world.

58
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,400
Being a Sexybod girl
has given me more confidence

59
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,520
than all of you have
in the last three years.

60
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,160
What is this?

61
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,880
That girl with Samara Kapoor?

62
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,080
That girl is me.

63
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,880
Have your own child!
Stay away from my daughter!

64
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,160
Don't call me ever again!

65
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,880
Fuck the board.

66
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,200
You can have this.

67
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,360
I'm done.

68
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,640
Oh, I didn't realize we had company.

69
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,240
Together forever?

70
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,880
What should have been a statement,
is now a question.

71
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,160
God, I hate question marks.

72
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,000
Fuck them!

73
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,440
Fuck them all!

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,440
I don't need anybody.

75
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,560
For the past two months, I've been
backpacking across Europe by myself.

76
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,600
I don't need anyone.

77
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,120
I'm a survivor!

78
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,080
I'm a lion!

79
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,080
Yes. I have many problems.

80
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,560
Why are you so concerned?

81
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,560
Shit.

82
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,440
Which book is shit?

83
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,960
What the hell are you talking about?

84
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,480
Shit.

85
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,840
Yes! Yes, shit.

86
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,520
Everything is shit.

87
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,720
Men are shit.
Women are shit.

88
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,240
All of bloody humanity is shit!

89
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,800
You're looking weak.

90
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,920
Doesn't Myra feed you?

91
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,360
Weak?

92
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,800
I have to keep looking
at your morose face every day.

93
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,280
Makes me lose my appetite.

94
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,560
Every day.

95
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,760
Right on that same chair.

96
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,280
With that same sad, moony face.

97
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,400
I heard that a broken heart
makes you lose your appetite.

98
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,880
Broken heart?

99
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,760
I FaceTime Xerxes every day.

100
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,400
You think about her, don't you?

101
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,400
Who? Xerxes?

102
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,960
Her.

103
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,600
-Stop it, Umang.
-Stop what?

104
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,080
I thought you liked the foreplay.

105
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,760
By the way, how is she?

106
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,800
I don't know.

107
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,040
We haven't spoken since the big fight.

108
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,440
I meant Samara.

109
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,680
I don't know.

110
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,400
We haven't spoken since the big fight.

111
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,280
-Will you just call her?
-Why don't you call her?

112
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,760
-I've moved on.
-Right.

113
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,280
Two steps forward and four steps back.

114
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,560
-Sids?
-Mangs...

115
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,440
I want to listen to Bollywood remixes...

116
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,480
while eating Bachelorr's chilli ice cream.

117
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,880
Go and have it.

118
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,440
How? I couldn't find
chilli ice cream in Istanbul.

119
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,000
What are you doing in Istanbul?

120
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,000
Trying to eat ice cream.

121
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,920
Mangs, I feel like my life's
melting away like an ice cream.

122
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,400
That Turkish ice cream guy was doing
so many tricks with the scoops...

123
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,920
that by the time he gave me the cone,
the entire ice cream fell to the ground!

124
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,520
But I still had to pay for it.

125
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,840
After that, I had four cups of strong
Turkish coffee, three hookahs,

126
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,360
and I ate an entire
mezze platter all by myself.

127
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,440
But none of it took
away my heartache, Mangs.

128
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,600
Sids, are you okay?

129
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,880
Nothing is okay, Mangs.

130
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,720
My heart is as lonely as I am.

131
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:30,160
No Papa, no Sneha, no Mihir,
no you. Any of you!

132
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,800
Where are Papa, Sneha and Mihir?

133
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,560
Why do you want to know?
Like you care!

134
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,960
I should put three locks on this
bridge and jump into the Bosporus.

135
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,400
Three locks for the three of you.

136
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,960
My three best friends,
my three lost loves.

137
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,720
Sids, please don't do anything stupid.

138
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,280
Who is going to stop me?

139
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,360
Mangs, you have no idea
what it's like to be me right now.

140
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,840
I'm trying really
hard but I'm struggling.

141
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,520
I'm trying to be strong
but this is just too hard.

142
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,920
-I'm too lonely, Mangs.
-Sids, please stop crying.

143
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,720
I'm listening to you.
I'm right here.

144
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,880
Where are you?

145
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,600
I'm here! I am lost, all alone,
thousands of miles away...

146
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,280
and I have no one with me.

147
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,840
Nobody cares, Mangs!
Nobody cares!

148
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,960
-Sids, please!
-I'm all alone!

149
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,280
Mangs, I'm really scared!

150
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,320
I'm losing it!

151
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,840
-Sids!
-I'm on the edge, Mangs!

152
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,160
-Sids, just don't do anything...
-I'm really scared.

153
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,160
-Please don't do anything.
-I need you guys right now.

154
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,320
Please come.

155
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,880
I'm so scared.

156
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,040
Sids!

157
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,480
Hello! Sids!

158
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,520
I'm on the edge, Mangs.

159
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,880
-Sids! Hello! Sids!
-Mangs, please...

160
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,440
-Stop!
-On the edge of what?

161
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,280
-Stop! Hey!
-Sids!

162
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,280
Hello! Sids!

163
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,080
Why can't I hear anything!

164
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,760
Fuck!

165
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,440
How much more time?

166
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,880
Half an hour, sir.

167
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,840
This bao better be worth it.

168
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,200
Listen, bao is the new bun.
It's everywhere.

169
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,720
Do you know where we had the best bao?
It was at that place in Seminyak.

170
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,120
I used to eat it every day.
I've put on so much weight!

171
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,280
Where?

172
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,520
On your eyelashes?

173
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,640
I'm sorry.

174
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,200
Anyway...

175
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,880
We were staying at a pool villa in Ubud.
It was so beautiful.

176
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,360
We'd go skinny-dipping every day.

177
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,520
And one day, you remember,
we had this... guest.

178
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,520
-Yes, a monkey came.
-A monkey!

179
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,240
And Varun ran out.

180
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,240
He came out naked! It was so funny.

181
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,520
Did he leave you alone in the pool?

182
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,200
-But it was...
-I am so irresponsible, right?

183
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,080
I didn't learn anything from you.

184
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,880
We decided to make this work, right?

185
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,240
Guys, excuse me.
I need to take this.

186
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,520
Hello.

187
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,520
Anj, Dee...
Dee, Anj...

188
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,240
Sids is in trouble.
We need to help her.

189
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,960
-What happened?
-What?

190
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,200
I don't even know the entire story

191
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,520
but she was bawling while
talking to me from Istanbul.

192
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,880
What is she doing in Istanbul?

193
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,000
Eating ice cream,
walking on the fucking bridges!

194
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,440
I have no idea!

195
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,520
She was ranting away!

196
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,200
She sounded like
she was losing her mind!

197
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,160
She actually said that she's on the edge!

198
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,520
I am scared shitless!

199
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,160
I really think that
we have to go to Istanbul.

200
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,520
You're crazy as well.

201
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,760
How can we just take off for Istanbul?

202
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,960
-Yeah.
-It's because, it's Siddhi!

203
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,240
She's all alone. She needs our help!

204
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,760
And, what if she's actually
headed for a breakdown?

205
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,480
Can we just meet?

206
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,760
In the midst of her breakdown, I could
hear the police sirens and ambulances.

207
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,840
And then, her phone got switched off.

208
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,880
I'm just super stressed about her!
Okay, guys?

209
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,360
She can do anything
when she is in depression.

210
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,880
I think we should head
to Istanbul to be with her.

211
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,360
We haven't spoken
to each other in forever.

212
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,600
And now, you want us to head to Istanbul.

213
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,520
We can't just hail a taxi
and drive to Istanbul.

214
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,520
And how will we find her there?

215
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,360
Are we going to shout out her name
from every bridge on the Bosporus?

216
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,800
I think we should call
the Indian Consulate.

217
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,160
Or, the hospital.
Or, her parents.

218
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,280
Right.

219
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,480
Because they would know
about Siddhi before us.

220
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,120
If something happens to her...

221
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,280
would you guys be
able to live with yourselves?

222
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,080
You knew that Siddhi
was in trouble and you still did nothing!

223
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,200
Wake up, guys.
We're talking about Sids.

224
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,320
She's fucked in the head.

225
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,560
And she is helpless without our support.

226
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,160
Honestly, if either of you were
in trouble

227
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,400
I would never leave you alone.

228
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,160
And I'm hoping you
would do the same for me.

229
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,200
I mean...

230
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,200
Sids is the baby of our group.

231
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,600
I'm not going to abandon her!

232
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,760
If you guys don't want to come,
don't come.

233
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,120
I'm going.

234
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,920
Shoes...

235
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,440
I'll call my father.

236
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,920
I'll get him to speak
to the Council General.

237
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,600
Maybe he can help us
with the visas.

238
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,720
I'll book the tickets and the hotel.

239
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,480
Please check the reviews of the hotel.

240
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,840
Dee, can you stop this, please?

241
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,880
-You want to fight again?
-Hey!

242
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,240
Who said the fight is over?

243
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,360
This is just temporary truce.

244
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,960
Siddhi's phone is still switched off.

245
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,600
I just hope to God that she's okay.

246
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,760
Economy seat?

247
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,680
By the time we get there,
we'll be squashed to pulp.

248
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,000
You're tiny.

249
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,000
You'll adjust well in economy.

250
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,320
Did you just call me short?

251
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,000
-I just called you "tiny."
-What is that supposed to mean?

252
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,800
It mean exactly what it sounded like.

253
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,080
Listen, however tiny I am,
I need my space.

254
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,920
I have a friendly advice for you...

255
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,600
unburden yourself from the pain
and get an upgrade.

256
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,880
And then, you guys
will call me entitled.

257
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,640
-You are entitled.
-At least I'm not judgmental.

258
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,120
That's you, Anj.

259
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,760
Fly away, bitches!

260
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,840
The guy sitting next to us
was constantly farting!

261
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,400
-And the way he scratched his balls...
-God!

262
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,000
I thought they would fall off.

263
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,840
His butt was in my face
when he was going to the bathroom.

264
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,920
Yuck!

265
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,120
Umang, check the location.

266
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,680
This is Sids' last seen
location pin on Insta.

267
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,360
-Sir, take a right turn from here.
-Right.

268
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,840
-Right.
-Take a right turn.

269
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,160
-This is it.
-This is it. Let's go.

270
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,120
Be your best, guys.

271
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,320
-Luggage?
-Get out.

272
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,520
-Okay.
-Okay! Hotel Aasik.

273
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,040
-Thank you so much. You got it?
-Yes.

274
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,000
Guys...

275
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,440
-What?
-No one's answering the door.

276
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,440
-Did you ring the bell?
-Yes.

277
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,280
-And? Not opening?
-No.

278
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,080
Ring the bell.

279
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:52,960
I am.

280
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,640
This is it.

281
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,600
-Is it this one?
-Yes. Hotel Aasik.

282
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,680
-Hello!
-Siddhi!

283
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,360
Come on!

284
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,920
Motherfuckers!

285
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,320
Dee, it's time to execute your plan.

286
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,960
Siddhi!

287
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,560
-Siddhi!
-Siddhi Patel!

288
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,960
Siddhi!

289
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,000
-Siddhi!
-Why are you shouting?

290
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,160
Sids, our friend. Siddhi!

291
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,480
-Have you seen this girl?
-No, I'm sorry.

292
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,480
Have you seen this girl?

293
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,720
Siddhi!

294
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,000
-Sids!
-Siddhi!

295
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,800
-Sids!
-Siddhi!

296
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,760
Siddhi!

297
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,080
-Siddhu!
-Good morning, ladies.

298
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,560
Oh, my God!
What are you doing here?

299
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,200
-What?
-You can't be serious.

300
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,000
Heart attack? Panic attack?
You had no attack at all?

301
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,080
Why? Did you want
something to happen to me?

302
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,400
Nervous breakdown?

303
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,560
Anxiety attack?

304
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,280
Suicidal thoughts involving a bridge?

305
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,200
Oh... I was wasted and
therefore I got a tad too emotional.

306
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,320
Even the cheapest
wine here is dangerously potent!

307
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,720
Did you get a tad too emotional?

308
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,360
Mangs, did you just hear that?

309
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,360
Did I hear police sirens on the
call or was it just my imagination?

310
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,400
Those were the police
sirens but obviously not for me.

311
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,360
A tourist got drunk and started
stripping his clothes off on the bridge.

312
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,440
So, the cops came and arrested him.

313
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,600
They're very strict here.

314
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,360
You're talking about people stripping.

315
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,200
While we've come here all
the way for you.

316
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,480
You hung up after repeatedly
ranting that you were on the edge.

317
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,640
I must have called you
back at least fifty times!

318
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,400
Sorry! My phone died.

319
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,280
Siddhi, we were scared for you!

320
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,960
How can you be so irresponsible?

321
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,760
Seriously? Why are we even here?

322
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,160
Because you all love me?

323
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,520
Guys, we haven't
spoken to each other in a long time.

324
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,640
But my one phone call got you all here.

325
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,040
I feel so special and loved.

326
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,080
My superheroes!

327
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,280
And we all feel so stupid.

328
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,840
Come on, Anj.
Let me have my moment.

329
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,520
After having wine,
I drank the local Raki.

330
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,480
It contains 50% alcohol!

331
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,080
I started hallucinating!

332
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,480
Wherever I went,
I could hallucinate you guys.

333
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,280
Every time I tried to reach out,
you'd vanish.

334
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,320
Disappear into thin air.

335
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,000
That's when I realized
how much I missed you all.

336
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,720
Siddhi, that's bullshit.
And you know that!

337
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,360
Be it whatever, but I got you here.

338
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:09,360
In a panic! We spent a lot of money,
got heartburn and smelt fart!

339
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,280
Fart? Oh, you mean on the flight.

340
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,960
I fart nonstop on flights.

341
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,240
I think it has something
to do with the pressure levels.

342
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,320
Who is this naked man?

343
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,000
My name is Baran.

344
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,880
You are all very beautiful.

345
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,640
Who is he?

346
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,320
-You are magnificent, baby.
-And you are too sexy, darling.

347
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,000
That will be 350 euros.

348
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,480
Or 2,000 Turkish liras.

349
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,840
But I prefer euros.

350
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,840
Sorry?

351
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,280
All night. Okay!

352
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,560
350 euros.

353
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,760
How much do you need?

354
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,880
-I don't have any money.
-Take this 200.

355
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,280
Don't give him a tip.

356
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,080
Goodbye, sweety.

357
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,160
Call me for the big fun!

358
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,200
But Siddhu,
at least you had the big fun!

359
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,640
You can laugh as much as you want!
That's all you can do!

360
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,200
Poor Siddhi. Naive Siddhi.

361
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,560
-She can't even take care of herself.
-Sids, it's not--

362
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,560
After that sleazy uncle
and cam-girl controversy...

363
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,000
Papa's also not talking to me.

364
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,920
And before you ask, Mohit has
moved to Goa with his new boyfriend.

365
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,880
Even he doesn't have time for me.

366
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,040
Mihir?

367
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,200
I'm sorry.

368
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,160
Why are you apologizing?

369
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,720
Because he's my father.

370
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,800
And he hurt my mom.

371
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,520
And he hurt you.

372
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,040
You're not your father's keeper.

373
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:23,800
Mihir, don't you want
to know why I did it?

374
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,880
You don't owe anyone
any explanation, Siddhi.

375
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,440
I need to get away from all this, Mihir.

376
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,760
Just to clear my head.

377
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,080
I'm also leaving.

378
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,800
Tonight.

379
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,640
Back to New York.

380
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,760
-Siddhu!
-Sids!

381
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,880
-Siddhi!
-Siddhi!

382
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,960
Poor Siddhi.

383
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,480
You guys had to come
all the way to save her.

384
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,480
I'm glad my stupidity
got you all together.

385
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,760
I slept with a prostitute.
So what? Big deal.

386
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,400
At least I didn't
slut shame my friends

387
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,000
the way you'll did to each other!

388
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,240
Siddhi, please don't be like this.

389
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,280
Sids, we're sorry!

390
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,480
Listen, we won't laugh anymore.
Promise.

391
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,200
Listen. Forgive us for
that day and for today.

392
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,280
Please forgive us.

393
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,080
You just admitted
how special you feel

394
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,640
-that we came all the way for you.
-Yeah!

395
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,800
That wasn't me!
Those were my endorphins talking!

396
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,160
My post-coital glow!

397
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,320
Wait a second.

398
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,160
350 euros?

399
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,520
He better have given you a glow.

400
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,560
Listen. Also...

401
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,760
Viju!

402
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,440
He freaked out during that scam.

403
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,480
Imagine if he finds out about this!

404
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,400
So, we all want to know

405
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,240
-what exactly happened yesterday?
-Yeah.

406
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,720
We made love.

407
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,160
Lots of love.

408
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,240
Wow. You made love.
So moronic!

409
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,560
-Repeatedly.
-Is she for real?

410
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,720
-All kinds of...
-Fine! We get it!

411
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,960
What happened before and after that?

412
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,720
Okay. So, I was wasted!

413
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,200
And I drunk dialed Umang.

414
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,680
I had my massive emotional moment
and I started feeling really hot.

415
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,280
I was feeling hot, so I kind of stripped.

416
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,800
And then, I jumped into a fountain.

417
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,160
But the water was freezing

418
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,720
and I started feeling cold!

419
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,320
Suddenly, I heard police whistles.

420
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,320
I didn't know what to do.

421
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,880
And just then...

422
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,720
my knight in shining Armour
showed up on a white Vespa

423
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,240
and swept me away.

424
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,080
Then, I threw up.

425
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,880
Wine, Raki, mezzes...

426
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,200
I threw up everything.

427
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,760
Then, we again had alcohol.

428
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,080
We sang loudly on the streets.

429
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,040
We saw the sunrise together.

430
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,240
It was magical, guys.

431
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,560
And then...

432
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,200
We went back to the
hotel and made love again.

433
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,920
And again. And again!

434
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,440
-We did it five times.
-Oh, God!

435
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,760
-Five times!
-Yeah.

436
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,080
We got that! Moving on!

437
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,200
Okay, fine.

438
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,480
What happened with Samara?

439
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,000
I went to Thailand...

440
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,720
chasing after her.

441
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,280
I stayed in Koh Samui for a few days.

442
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,320
And...

443
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,040
I trained in Muay Thai and...

444
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,880
Yeah! It was cool.

445
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,560
I can't do this.

446
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,880
I can't do this, Umang.
My career will be over.

447
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,240
Sam, please.

448
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,080
Just give us one more chance.

449
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,160
I'm sure we can make it work.

450
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,520
Why did you come?

451
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,000
Why did you come?
I told you not to come!

452
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,280
Okay. It wasn't cool.

453
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,480
I wasn't cool and
the weather wasn't either.

454
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,600
I was shattered.

455
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,080
It was hard to get up in the morning.

456
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,040
And every day...

457
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,760
my heart and my mind were at war.

458
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,600
And everything hurt!

459
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,240
My skin, my eyelids... It was just...

460
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,640
I have said enough.
What about you all?

461
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,440
Anj?

462
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,800
So...

463
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,520
Arjun got me out on bail.

464
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,160
Thankfully, they didn't
put me behind bars.

465
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,720
But, huge fine.

466
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,440
My license got confiscated.

467
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,800
And by the way, I...

468
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,560
don't really drink anymore.

469
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,480
Yeah. Maybe one drink in a week at best.

470
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,360
I'm still very scared. I am very...

471
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,680
traumatized by what happened that night.

472
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,360
And, what about Arya's custody?

473
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,480
We've decided we're not
going to pursue Arya's custody.

474
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,800
We can't take Arya away from you.

475
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,600
We can't do this to you, to Arya.

476
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,160
We can't tear the family apart.

477
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,160
Thank you.

478
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,440
I went to their wedding.

479
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,200
It was... really nice.

480
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,320
Simple, elegant.

481
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,400
And, what about Arjun?

482
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,160
So... we guys are together.

483
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,960
-Yeah!
-Nice!

484
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,120
Arjun's a great guy.
Always liked him.

485
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,040
Dee, I saw your speech.

486
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,840
The one you gave before
you returned the award.

487
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,280
Me too.
It was trending.

488
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,640
#SoBrave.

489
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,640
So now? What's next in store for you?

490
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,840
Judge Damodar?

491
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,720
I'm writing a book on him.

492
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,080
Is he the one involved in
2012 bombings case?

493
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,960
His body was found on the railway tracks.

494
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,200
He was murdered

495
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,040
just a night before he was
about to pronounce the verdict.

496
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,440
For the last six months, I've gone back
and forth from Latur to Delhi to Pune.

497
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,760
I've just been doing my research.

498
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,120
I must have interviewed
over 125 people and...

499
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,760
It's been a hell of a journey.

500
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,440
But it was fulfilling.

501
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,520
Wow, Dee!

502
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,120
Dying to read it.

503
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,960
And Jeh?

504
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,160
I pretended like Julia Roberts...

505
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,320
and went to profess my love.

506
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,480
And guess who appears out of nowhere.

507
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,320
-Myra.
-What?

508
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,280
What was she doing there?

509
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,800
They have a history.
They've been together since school.

510
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,480
It was just a kiss.
So, Jeh forgave her.

511
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,600
And yeah...

512
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,440
But I think it's a rebound fling.

513
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,680
And you know this because...

514
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,760
Because I still go to Truck bar.

515
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,440
Traitor.

516
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,760
Please!

517
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,960
The world may have abandoned me...

518
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,960
but Jeh's the one
who took me in, okay?

519
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,080
Right.

520
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,080
I was the one abandoned by all of you.

521
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,120
Guys, let's face it. We all feel
that we were the ones abandoned.

522
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,560
Okay, let's make a pact, guys.

523
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,440
This will never happen again.

524
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,360
Nothing will ever break us apart.

525
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,000
-Just the way we wrote in our slam books.
-Yeah.

526
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,120
The best ship is friendship.

527
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,200
To never jumping ship.

528
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,800
And if one jumps, we all jump.

529
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,080
Even if the water is freezing.

530
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,560
To no more fucking Titanics.

531
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,240
Our hearts will go on and on and on.

532
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,560
Fuck the Titanic!

533
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,760
-Fuck the Titanic!
-Fuck the Titanic!

534
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,600
Friendship. Tied and sealed forever.

535
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,920
You know that they remove
these every few months, right?

536
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,560
So much for "forever."

537
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,240
Why are you so cynical?

538
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,160
Why are you so romantic?

539
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,840
Why do you two talk so much?

540
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,000
Guys...

541
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,320
I'm sorry.

542
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,600
I'm sorry for everything.

543
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,000
I said too much the other day.

544
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,400
I have no right to judge
anyone or their struggles.

545
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,360
Look, I'm sorry too.

546
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,560
You guys know that sometimes
I really have no control over my tongue.

547
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,240
So, I off-loaded all my anger
on the three of you.

548
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,080
I'm really sorry.
I'm sorry.

549
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,880
It's okay.

550
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,160
And I'm sorry.

551
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:33,800
For a while,
I couldn't see beyond Samara.

552
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,360
And she became more important
to me than our friendship.

553
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,320
It's not cool. I'm sorry.

554
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,880
-Not cool.
-It's okay.

555
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,160
And I'm sorry for
having started it all.

556
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,720
For keeping secrets from you all
that I shouldn't have.

557
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,640
And?

558
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,360
No! I'm not sorry
for getting you all here.

559
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,360
Not at all! Look around you!

560
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,280
-Sure.
-Yeah.

561
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,280
Do you remember that carpet
I told you about back home?

562
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,840
So...

563
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,960
I have hidden everything
about bisexuality.

564
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,320
I told my parents.

565
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:17,920
And since then... no one
talks to each other.

566
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,360
Guys.

567
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,680
We're very proud of you.

568
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,440
Siddhi, you're back!

569
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,040
Siddhi's here.

570
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,640
Thank you.

571
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,160
Welcome home, darling.

572
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,040
Thank you, Mummy.

573
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,040
The return of the world traveler.

574
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,960
She's spent all the money!

575
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,360
She spent my money Viju and not yours.

576
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,640
Don't worry about him, he'll be fine.
Come.

577
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,440
How was it?
Did you have fun?

578
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,040
Why don't you go and freshen up?
I'll make us some tea.

579
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,400
There's a new bar in Kala Ghoda.
It's got great reviews.

580
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,440
Dee...

581
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,080
I can't go back in there, guys.

582
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,680
I haven't been in
there since you know...

583
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:19,280
Listen, I told him how I felt
and then, I got to know about Myra.

584
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,320
-Dee, we're not in school anymore.
-Yeah.

585
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,840
The two of you were confused,
It didn't work out. Just get over it.

586
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,600
What about our bra-code?

587
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,000
Why should we change
our hangout spot for a guy?

588
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,520
And to be honest, she is not all bad.

589
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,760
I mean, she is like
every other girlfriend.

590
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,000
Also, it's not Myra but it's me.
I embarrassed myself and I can't...

591
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,960
We'll sit at a distance from Jeh and Myra.

592
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,400
-Yeah.
-And we'll only talk to Bosco.

593
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,840
-Yes! Come on!
-Now please let's go in. Come on!

594
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,680
Hey, girls.

595
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,200
Long time.

596
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,400
Sorry, girls.
The bar area is shut for service.

597
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,200
Relax. We're going outside.

598
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,320
Hey, Bosco!

599
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,680
So, three usual and
one lime soda, please.

600
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,600
-Oh, my God.
-What...

601
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,680
-happened here?
-Okay!

602
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,240
-Okay. Let's get to work.
-Let's go.

603
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,080
Let's do this. Come on, baby.

604
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,000
Guys, let's send Myra up for good.

605
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,920
-In an aircraft?
-She means let's bump her off.

606
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,440
What does that mean?

607
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,640
We're in Mumbai.
Let's put a hit on her.

608
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,400
Hang on. Wait a second.
Anj...

609
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,560
Why did we change the topic?

610
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,680
You're confusing me.

611
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,720
Where were you in the '90s?

612
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,200
Guys, I was born in the '90s?

613
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,360
She means contract killings.

614
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,880
Guys, Myra can't be blamed for this.

615
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:52,000
The issues are... between Jeh and me.

616
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,440
Guys, I have an idea.

617
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,840
Let's spike her drink with hormone pill.

618
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,560
She'll grow a beard
and mustache in no time!

619
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,880
It'll be so funny!

620
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,240
My God, Siddhi. You're the exact
opposite of what we thought of you!

621
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,800
You're diabolical, Siddhi!

622
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,120
Thank you! Finally, you'll
stop calling me cute.

623
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,520
Cute and diabolical.

624
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,440
Hey! Jeh!

625
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,200
-All right!
-You shouldn't have.

626
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,920
-That's so sweet.
-Bosco is busy.

627
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:21,240
Oh! Bosco told his boss that he's busy.

628
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,000
So, who's the boss?

629
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,120
Oh, wait.

630
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,160
The boss is the boss lady, right?

631
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,080
I hear she's into S&M.

632
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,560
That's a good thing.

633
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,320
Women on top.

634
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,880
Right, Jeh?

635
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,840
And she is normally on top. Right?

636
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,320
I mean asking for a friend.

637
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,040
Such badly behaved girls.

638
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,360
-Fifty shades of Jeh.
-Yeah.

639
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,280
I bet he's into BDSM and all.

640
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,160
Sorry.

641
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,560
Tell me, did you miss us?

642
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,520
No, I didn't.

643
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,600
-He did.
-We know that you're lying.

644
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,480
-Don't lie.
-Yeah.

645
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,400
-Say it. Come on, Jeh.
-Come on, say it!

646
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,040
-Say it, come on!
-Look, I won't lie.

647
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,440
I don't know about me...

648
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,640
but my cash register definitely did.

649
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,640
You love us, Jeh!

650
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,480
-You love us!
-You love us!

651
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,600
-You've missed us!
-You missed us!

652
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,520
Jeh...

653
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,560
-Four...
-More shots please!

654
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,400
Yeah! Cheers!
