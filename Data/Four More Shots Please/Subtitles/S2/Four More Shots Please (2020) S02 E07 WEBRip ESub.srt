1
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:06,760
Don't be afraid.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,920
Stop hiding.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,920
Take a chance on yourself.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,320
Put an end to this fight
and step into the light.

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,280
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
our firm's newest senior partner.

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,200
The illustrious, Anjana Menon.
Round of applause for her.

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,280
Thank you, everyone.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,880
The only Indian lawyer
I consider my equal...

9
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,520
even though she hasn't been to
Harvard Law like me.

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,080
You must then be hurting from
losing to a lawyer from NLS.

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,560
Maybe I let you win.
It's called chivalry.

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,600
Ain't dead yet.

13
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,320
If only I could encounter such
chivalry every day.

14
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,160
But you have to admit,
nothing beats Harvard Law.

15
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,880
How many times did you
appear for LSAT?

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,920
I passed the second time.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,840
I topped CLAT in the first go.

18
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,400
Harvard Square, nightlife at Cambridge,

19
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,160
the best thinking minds in the world
giving lectures in law.

20
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,520
Beat that, Miss Menon.

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,640
Bangalore pubs, Cubbon Park,

22
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,520
the best Indian law minds
giving guest lectures

23
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,920
and our Indie rock scene.
Beat that.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,400
Indie rock scene!

25
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,560
I was there watching U2 perform live...

26
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,920
and The Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd.

27
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,120
There's no coming back from that.

28
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,000
A minute of silence.

29
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,520
I just realized how old you are!

30
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,040
Grab a seat, Miss Menon.

31
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,600
Umang, be natural. Relax.

32
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,440
-Hold.
-Yeah.

33
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,440
Gary...

34
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,680
-Look at this.
-Have a look at this, bro.

35
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,160
-It's not... it's not looking good.
-She's looking too stiff.

36
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,680
-Like just befriend her.
-Yeah.

37
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,800
-Tell her to calm down.
-Okay.

38
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,840
Umang, forget the camera.

39
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,720
Just workout like you do every day.

40
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,880
Grab some dumbbells.

41
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,720
It's looking too masculine.

42
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,320
Grab something lighter.

43
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,440
These?

44
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,000
Aren't these too light?

45
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,360
It doesn't matter, Umang.
It's about looking hot.

46
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,480
It's about looking sexy.

47
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,440
Hold.

48
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,240
Umang, show a little more power.

49
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,440
This is all the power
I can show with such light weights.

50
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,160
You just need to act.

51
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,640
And not like you're constipated!

52
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,600
You guys don't get it. I'm on a
high-protein diet since morning!

53
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,960
I've eaten eight egg whites!

54
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,760
I'll obviously be constipated if
I use such light weights!

55
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,200
Get a laxative brand to sponsor this!

56
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,840
Umang, take off the jacket.

57
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,240
Excuse me.

58
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,280
And the sneakers.

59
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,680
Ma'am, those belong to the sponsors.

60
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,680
Place them at the side.

61
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,600
They will be seen more prominently
at the edge of the frame.

62
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,280
Who is the...

63
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,600
-You're the hairdresser?
-Yes.

64
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,000
-What's your name?
-Justine.

65
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,360
Justine, I want a simple ponytail
and natural makeup.

66
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,680
Samara, won't it look boring on camera?

67
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,840
Come here.

68
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,880
We're gonna frame here.

69
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,920
So... low angle.

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,960
We want that elongation.

71
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,560
-Get details.
-Okay.

72
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,680
Details of her body.

73
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,040
It's lovely. It's going to look lovely!

74
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,080
So fucking good!

75
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,360
You see what we were doing?
With you in that frame?

76
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,520
-Hi!
-Hi!

77
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,520
Hello, baby. Your sister Arya loves you.

78
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,480
And baby loves you!

79
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,240
-You look great.
-Thank you!

80
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,760
In my second trimester, I was as big
as an inflated balloon!

81
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,640
And I was working every single day.

82
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,760
-Really? That must have been so hectic.
-Yeah.

83
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,240
And I'm sure Varun never helped.
He's such an ass.

84
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,160
-Who's an ass?
-No... nobody.

85
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,200
Turmeric milk!

86
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,320
Come, come.

87
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,920
Thank you.

88
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,680
Foot stool?

89
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,480
Not bad, Varun.

90
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,680
It's an Ottoman.
Thank you.

91
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,080
You should be a full-time nurse
or a caregiver.

92
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,360
You'll make a fortune.

93
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,360
Anjana, please don't ruin
things for me.

94
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,480
I adore Varun 2.0!

95
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,480
I mean... breakfast in bed
and foot massages at night.

96
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,360
It's awesome!

97
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,040
Varun...

98
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,920
you've changed.

99
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,920
Really?

100
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,240
Men can do that?

101
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,080
Is that humanly possible?

102
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,360
Sometimes. Like when
Neanderthals became Sapiens.

103
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,480
Evolution and such rare occasions.

104
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,160
What can I say? I'm a...

105
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,160
rare evolved butterfly.

106
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,520
How exotic!

107
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,480
Keep fluttering around.
I'm leaving.

108
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,920
Bye, guys. See you!

109
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,800
-Bye, Mom.
-Bye. You take care.

110
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,440
-Bye.
-You, too.

111
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,720
Arya, come on!

112
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,320
Come, let me show you
what I got you.

113
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,360
Come, come, come!

114
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,600
Listen, we need to talk.

115
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,520
I'm feeling very guilty
about what happened.

116
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,760
Guilt is good.

117
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,360
It means that...

118
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,600
you won't screw up again.

119
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,360
"You?"

120
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,000
If I remember correctly...
you k.i.s.s.e.d. me back.

121
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,640
It was a reflex action.

122
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,760
Like for a millisecond. And then
I pushed you away, remember?

123
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,960
Pookie aunty, come catch me!

124
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,360
Wait! Where are you going?

125
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,240
We can't let Kavs know.

126
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,720
Of course not, Varun.
It was a big mistake.

127
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,040
This will never happen again.

128
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,720
Best to just forget about it.

129
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,480
Sam, I'm home.

130
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,120
How was the fitness video rehearsal?

131
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,560
Producers' happy?

132
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,560
It was weird. I don't know...
it felt fake.

133
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,280
When I train you, it feels natural.
It feels real.

134
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,560
Actually, why can't I train you
in my videos?

135
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,440
Just imagine how hot
that will look!

136
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,600
Me?

137
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,280
In a web video, with my ass
up in the air?

138
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,800
Come on, baby, that would be
crossing the line!

139
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,200
What line?

140
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,680
Because I'm a star! I...
I don't need this.

141
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,480
It will be humiliating.

142
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,680
People will think that it will
be the last nail in my coffin.

143
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,320
Desperate!

144
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,800
-Yeah.
-You know...

145
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,560
I don't know what I say sometimes.

146
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,840
I'm sorry.

147
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,240
Can you... can you turn
down the blender?

148
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,920
Please?

149
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,640
I said I'm sorry.

150
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,360
Why?

151
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,120
I should know better.

152
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,640
Why would a superstar want to feature in
my desperate fitness video?

153
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,240
It's not desperate.

154
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,120
It's your video.
It will be amazing.

155
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,000
But it will be the last
nail in your coffin, right?

156
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,000
I want to do this.

157
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,080
For you.

158
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,560
For me?

159
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,320
For us.

160
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,680
Umang, you got me fit again.

161
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,080
You pulled me out of the black hole.

162
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,000
I... I want to show the world
exactly what you're capable of.

163
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,520
Please.

164
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,880
Please! I'm sorry.

165
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,080
Make a video with me, baby.

166
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,280
Come closer.

167
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,200
Action!

168
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,160
Papa.

169
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,640
Papa!

170
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,320
It's my special solo
performance tonight, Papa.

171
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,400
Will you come with Mummy?

172
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,880
Papa, I've tried so many things in life.

173
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,840
But, this might be something
I'm actually good at.

174
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,320
Please, Papa. I need you there.

175
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,600
Papa, I need my best friend.

176
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,120
Chill!

177
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,520
No matter how ridiculous the fancy dress,
parents still love their kids!

178
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,360
They'll love your show, Sids.

179
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,640
I don't even know if they're
both coming.

180
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,760
-Siddhi.
-Maybe Papa...

181
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,120
Siddhi!

182
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,360
I'm so excited! I'm so excited!

183
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,960
Thank you for coming, Papa.

184
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,360
How long is the show?

185
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,360
My set will run for ten minutes.

186
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,600
Good.

187
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,520
We have dinner with the Mehrotras
and I do not want to be late.

188
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,240
Hi, Uncle. Good evening.
I'm Amit, Siddhi's friend.

189
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,040
Hi, Sumit. How lovely to finally meet you.

190
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,720
-Likewise, ma'am.
-He is very cute.

191
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,960
He's much better looking
than I expected!

192
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,760
I'm paying him a compliment.
He likes it!

193
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,880
-It's Amit first of all.
-Okay, yes.

194
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,640
So, sir.

195
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,320
All good in the hood?

196
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,080
Your daughter stole my heart.

197
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,760
What the fuck was that?

198
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,720
Hi, guys, sorry I'm a little
nervous today

199
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,720
because my parents are here
in the audience.

200
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,320
Watching me perform
for the very first time.

201
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,440
Although, I have performed
quite a few times...

202
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,960
for strangers like you.

203
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,760
Except back then...

204
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,640
I used to strip on the internet.

205
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,760
No, seriously. Don't laugh.
It's not a joke.

206
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,400
Hashtag, true story!

207
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,880
For the half of you who are
googling me at this point,

208
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,640
let me just save you some time
and data and tell you...

209
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,760
that I never did the full Monty.

210
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,120
Although, there was this one guy...

211
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,840
who used to barbecue wearing
nothing but an apron.

212
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,000
And I was panicked that...

213
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,640
he would end up barbecuing
something else instead!

214
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:01,400
So, what was a cultured, south of the
Sea Link girl like me doing...

215
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,440
standing in her lingerie in front of
half a million subscribers?

216
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,200
Guys, you know, the road to self-love
is through self-hate.

217
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,880
All I wanted was some
love and validation.

218
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,080
It sounds fucked up, right?

219
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,840
But, do you know what's
more fucked up?

220
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,840
An eight-year-old girl on a diet.

221
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,560
And then, when I was fourteen years
old, the fuck up became bigger.

222
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,920
My friends started telling me

223
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,960
that your boobs are so big,
you should name them.

224
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,000
I said fine.
And I named them.

225
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,160
Karan one, Karan two.

226
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,280
But the mother of all fuck ups was
when I met a NRI boy for marriage.

227
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,560
And he had the balls to tell me
that my ass is so big,

228
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,440
it needed a pin code of its own.

229
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,800
-No!
-Oh, my God!

230
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,160
I've made a separate hit list
of the NRI grooms.

231
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,720
And I will thrash each one myself!

232
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,800
Correct. Correct!

233
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,320
So much attitude. What for?

234
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,600
I mean, they live in some tiny corner
of Silicon Valley...

235
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,080
and behave like the Taj Mahal
is their outhouse.

236
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,160
Like an assembly line...

237
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,200
mini golf every Tuesday,
Mexican food every Wednesday,

238
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,520
home food all day and
sex on Sundays.

239
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,360
Please spare me.

240
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,440
I hate home food...

241
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,720
and I want sex every Monday,
Wednesday and Friday.

242
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,760
And Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays.

243
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,200
Twice.

244
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,160
She is rocking it!

245
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,880
So, you know there are these
filters that give you abs, right?

246
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,520
I tried one of those fat-free filters.

247
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,120
But I still couldn't find
my knight in shining armor.

248
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,560
Instead, what did I get?

249
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,960
Manish from Surat.

250
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,240
Who actually messaged me and said…

251
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,360
"Babes! Hot cleavage.
Tell me bobz size."

252
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,800
So, when I asked him if he
was a bra salesman,

253
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:47,520
he actually tells me, "Fuck off, whore.
Get your stomach stapled."

254
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,640
You know, when I used to go
onto Sexybod site,

255
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,400
not one person called me fat.

256
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,400
Not one person called me busty,
buffalo, fatso...

257
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,320
or whatever it is that you all thought
when I first walked up on stage.

258
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,080
On that semi-pornographic site,
shockingly,

259
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,800
is where I learnt how
to accept myself.

260
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,680
How to accept myself in this size ten,
God gifted, fully functioning body.

261
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,400
And that's when I realized that the
biggest fuck up in the whole world...

262
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,400
is the idea of flawless beauty.

263
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,960
Yes!

264
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,000
You know, even when the most
gorgeous girl in the world

265
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,320
looks at herself in the mirror,
she only sees her flaws.

266
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,280
She's either too dark or too short
or too skinny or whatever.

267
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,680
Man-made notions of ideal, perfect
beauty upheld by society.

268
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,240
So, now when people ask me,
"Hey, Siddhi! What's up?"

269
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,520
I just tell them...

270
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,840
my self-esteem.

271
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,400
Well-done, Siddhi. Well-done!

272
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,800
Sidi-Pidi.

273
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,800
So proud of you!

274
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,040
Really, Papa?

275
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,720
You were born to do this.

276
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,120
You smashed it!

277
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,400
Thank you, Papa!

278
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,560
Sorry darling, I couldn't
protect you from the world.

279
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,360
And this guilt was eating me alive.

280
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,440
No, Papa.

281
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,640
You've loved me so much that
I learnt to protect myself.

282
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,320
I'm sorry, Papa.
I love you.

283
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,160
I love you too, darling.

284
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,800
Group hug?

285
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,080
Hey! Where did you come from?

286
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,960
Just joking! Come on! Come!

287
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,120
1.3 million views?

288
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,480
In three days!
We've gone viral!

289
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,080
Oh, my God. Forget the views.
Let's read the comments.

290
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,680
They love me again!

291
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,360
So awesome!

292
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,520
That was a fabulous meeting
with Titus Corp.

293
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,200
Thank you so much for bringing
them to our firm, Miss Menon.

294
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,920
You're welcome, Mr. Bose.

295
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,960
Cheers to you.

296
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,960
And also...

297
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,000
thank God nothing happened between us.

298
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,720
You know, you were absolutely right.

299
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,880
It would've complicated everything.

300
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,560
Yes. I told you.

301
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,480
I mean it's better like this, right?

302
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,640
We're professionals.
We work together.

303
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,080
It's better, right?

304
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,920
Absolutely.

305
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,760
And now I've made you think about...

306
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,640
what if we had?

307
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,520
Reverse psychology, Anjana.

308
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,280
Works every time.

309
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,320
Shashank, aren't we a little old
to play these games?

310
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,960
I'm not playing a game, Anjana.

311
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,480
Should we leave?

312
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,080
Yeah.

313
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,560
Thank you for the lift, Mr. Bose.

314
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,680
You hesitated back there
at the restaurant.

315
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,400
I was being polite.

316
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,560
Oh.

317
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,960
I thought that you--

318
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,240
There's nothing to think about.

319
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,960
The famous false denial all over again.

320
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,400
You know everything about me?

321
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,560
Yes.

322
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,320
I know that it bothers you.

323
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,920
Bothers me?

324
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,920
Because I'm getting under your skin.

325
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,920
And you're scared.

326
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,080
Of what?

327
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,640
Feelings.

328
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,080
Desires.

329
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,960
Are you holding back, Miss Menon?

330
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,760
Can't always give in to temptation, right?

331
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,200
You want to go somewhere else?

332
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,800
I... I got to go.

333
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,720
Guys, I'm sorry! I'm...

334
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,000
late?

335
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,880
Anj...

336
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,240
he's married.

337
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:04,920
What?

338
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,640
Anj, I saw the two of you.

339
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,400
In the car.
Making out like horny teenagers.

340
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,800
Guys...

341
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,880
Shashank is exciting,
he's smart, he...

342
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,440
-challenges me.
-Once again...

343
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,800
he's married.

344
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,160
It's an open marriage.

345
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,640
Open or not, I don't give a fuck!

346
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,560
I'm worried about you because
you might get hurt!

347
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,280
You and Shashank have no future.

348
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,960
And what if I don't want a future?

349
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,440
Anj... you really think you
can carry on with this

350
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,240
without getting emotionally invested?

351
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,040
Remember what happened
with you and Arjun?

352
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,680
Arjun was an entirely
different matter, Sids!

353
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,240
Really? How?

354
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,760
He wanted a future, marriage, kids!

355
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,560
None of that is going to
happen with Shashank!

356
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,880
Okay, fine.

357
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,640
If you've already
rationalized all of this, then...

358
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,320
why the hesitation?

359
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,160
Not hesitation.
Deliberation.

360
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,000
Don't do it, Anj.

361
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,200
Open marriage or not,
they are still married.

362
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,920
I agree. It's just going to get
really messy.

363
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,800
Mangs?

364
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,640
Hear everyone out.
Do what you want.

365
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,160
It's your life.

366
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,920
Do what you think is best for you.

367
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,880
Thank God.

368
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,800
At least one of you is on my side.

369
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,920
No, Anj. Don't misunderstand.

370
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,640
I am not on your side.

371
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,720
But as your friend,
I support your decision.

372
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,680
There's a difference.

373
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,520
Give it to me straight, please?

374
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,640
I just think this relationship
will run on fifth gear.

375
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,480
And then, it will head for a crash.

376
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,960
Whether you have your
seat belt on or not,

377
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,200
there will be some damage.

378
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,800
-Bye.
-Bye.

379
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,960
Bye, Dee.

380
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,800
Let's go.

381
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,160
Just relax.

382
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,560
The doctor will be here any minute.

383
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,120
She'll run some final checks and
then we'll move you to the OT.

384
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,520
And don't worry.

385
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,320
A couple of days of rest and
you'll be fine.

386
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,080
Hey!

387
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,320
Done so soon?

388
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,640
How are you feeling?

389
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,480
Why didn't they give you a wheelchair?

390
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,080
Dee, what happened?

391
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,120
What's wrong?
Are you in pain?

392
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,120
I couldn't do it.

393
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,720
I couldn't go through it... I...

394
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,240
I... I couldn't do it!

395
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,680
I couldn't do it!

396
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,040
-It's okay.
-It's okay.

397
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,480
It's okay.

398
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,960
-It's okay.
-It's fine.

399
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,960
It's okay.

400
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,080
You know ever since...

401
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,400
I was eleven years old,

402
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,440
I had five year plans.

403
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,800
Like government plans?

404
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,680
It was called
Damini Planning Commission.

405
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,880
Wow.

406
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,480
I had a slogan.

407
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,080
India's growth is Damini's growth.

408
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,240
Wow!

409
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,920
At eleven, I was just trying
to figure out...

410
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,480
how I could hide from Sneha and
eat Julie's cupcakes.

411
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,120
And I was trying to figure
out what will be better...

412
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,160
a sports bra or like... a t-shirt bra.

413
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,120
You know, to reduce
the movement in my bosom!

414
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,440
Who says that anymore!

415
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,800
Do you know, I've never
played with dolls.

416
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,200
Never got them married.

417
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,120
This marriage, settling down
was never part of the plan!

418
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,920
Dee, how often does life
fall in line with our plans?

419
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,920
But I want to control everything!

420
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,640
And for the first time, I feel like
life's taking a whole different turn

421
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,560
and I'm just following through blindly!

422
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,400
Let's go.

423
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,200
Baby.

424
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,960
Two one-way tickets on this
new, crazy, unplanned...

425
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,640
journey, I guess?

426
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,600
Wrong!

427
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,040
-Five one-way tickets?
-Yeah!

428
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,720
Correction. Six.

429
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,320
-What about Arya, guys?
-Oh!

430
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,560
You forgot about her, didn't you?
What's wrong with all of you?

431
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,960
She's dying to be an elder sister,
by the way.

432
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,200
So sweet.

433
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,240
Okay. Cheers!
To the six of us!

434
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,480
Papa helped get me a stall...

435
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,160
and a panel discussion
at the Fort Lit-Fest.

436
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,320
His newspaper is the main sponsor.

437
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,280
In India, nepotism is wrong
only when others do it.

438
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,240
Wine?

439
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,440
I have a headache, I'll...

440
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,800
I'll stick to water.

441
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,440
Do you want a pill?

442
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,240
No, no. I'm fine now.
I'll just sleep it off.

443
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,720
Don't be so stressed about
tomorrow's panel discussion.

444
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,080
You'll be great.

445
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,240
So, chow mein...

446
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,520
Kung Pao prawns.

447
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,360
I think, this place uses a lot of
flavor enhancers.

448
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,560
No, they don't.

449
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,040
It's all about the umami.

450
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,520
Not feeling experimental or hungry.

451
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,720
But you go ahead.

452
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,920
I'll serve you?

453
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,400
Come.

454
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,520
What's going on, Damini?

455
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,720
Jeh, I...

456
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:05,920
I...

457
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,560
I...

458
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,440
I need to tell you something.

459
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,280
Okay, what is it?

460
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,880
I...

461
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,520
I...

462
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,680
I hate Indian Chinese.

463
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,160
Did you seriously think I'd
choose chow mein over you?

464
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,680
Okay, look. I promise I will never
order any Chindian food again.

465
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,000
No chow mein, no kung pao...

466
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,480
and especially none of that chilly
garlic whatever that is, okay?

467
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,520
I promise.

468
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,480
Can we go back to sleep?

469
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,720
Or do you want to eat some more?

470
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,280
You'll eat some more?

471
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,120
Thank you.

472
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,720
Bloody February.

473
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,840
Oh, man.

474
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,240
Great. My book's come in handy
for squatting flies!

475
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,480
Can you stop with the pessimism?

476
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,000
It's just ten in the morning, okay?
So, relax.

477
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,800
They've stuck us in a corner.
No one's going to notice us.

478
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,880
Look. They're all walking past us.

479
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:22,920
Okay.

480
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,520
Come here people!

481
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,440
I think we need a fire-eater.

482
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,040
Or a cool, good looking bartender?

483
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,680
-Jeh!
-Jeh!

484
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,560
How's the baby doing?

485
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,040
How many copies have you sold?

486
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,160
Oh!
Zero.

487
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,680
Guys, I have a panel discussion.
I must go.

488
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,080
She's been acting strange
since last night.

489
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,120
Why is she avoiding me?

490
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,040
-She's just nervous.
-Low-carb diet.

491
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,360
She has the loosies.

492
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,240
-Hi, Damini.
-Hi.

493
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,720
I'm Nidhi, one of the organizers.

494
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,400
Nice to meet you, Nidhi.
How are you?

495
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,160
-Good.
-Yogita is moderating the panel, right?

496
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,320
Yes. Didn't you get Alwin's email?

497
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,520
Actually, there's no network
on my phone since the morning.

498
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,560
I think there's a reception
problem here.

499
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,680
I'm sorry, Damini but the
topic has changed.

500
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,080
Oh! Really? That's not what
the schedule says.

501
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,200
Here.

502
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,560
Topic is the same. But it has
a different angle now.

503
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,160
Bloody February won't fit in.

504
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,520
Okay.

505
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,440
Okay, no problem.

506
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,840
Can I then just talk about my book
for five minutes...

507
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,920
if that's okay with you?

508
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,160
I'm sorry, Damini,
that's not possible.

509
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,640
Only panelists are allowed to talk.

510
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,480
And... we have a new author
on the panel so...

511
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,640
it's...

512
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,680
No, no. I get it. I get it.

513
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Political pressure.

514
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,320
No, no. We don't bow
down to political pressure!

515
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,080
Damini...

516
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,600
-Dee! What happened?
-What's wrong?

517
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,120
They dropped me from the panel.

518
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,080
-What?
-What?

519
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,080
Why?

520
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,240
How can they even do that?

521
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,360
They really think they can
shut me up so easily?

522
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,440
Judge Damodar gave his life
for the truth.

523
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,200
I owe it to him.

524
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,720
I owe it to him to
not keep quiet, right?

525
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,880
-Yeah.
-Yeah, what can we do?

526
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,800
Anj, I need your help.

527
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:35,960
Ready?

528
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,520
Why do you think there's a conspiracy
behind Judge Damodar's death?

529
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:44,720
Judge Damodar was about to deliver
a verdict on the bombings of 2012.

530
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,560
And just a day before the verdict,
he is found dead.

531
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,160
Rumors claim suicide.

532
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,880
Why would a happy, successful and
committed man commit suicide?

533
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,480
So, you believe it was a conspiracy,
not suicide.

534
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,720
Definitely.

535
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,040
When his son decided to
probe his death,

536
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:06,360
the entire family suddenly
died in an accident.

537
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,800
Ma'am...

538
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,640
people like you
should be shot dead.

539
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,600
Hey! Back off all right!

540
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,080
No, no. It's fine.
It's fine.

541
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,480
Sir, why do you feel
I should be shot dead?

542
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,200
Because you're anti-national.

543
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,160
I'm not an anti-national, sir.

544
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,040
I love my country so much...

545
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,240
that I can question the
government without fear.

546
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,240
Isn't that the difference between
a democracy and a dictatorship?

547
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,880
Loving your country doesn't necessarily
mean loving your government.

548
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,400
Go write your feminazi bullshit!

549
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,160
Why this sudden interest in politics?

550
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,240
Damodar was bought over by
the urban Naxals.

551
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,160
And he committed suicide
out of shame.

552
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,240
Right.

553
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,520
And, how do you know this, sir?
Were you there?

554
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,560
Everyone knows.

555
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,240
Courtesy WhatsApp University?

556
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,360
Fuck off! You worthless prostitute!

557
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,280
-Hey!
-One second.

558
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,160
If you have so many problems
with the Indian Government,

559
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,480
then go to Pakistan!

560
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,680
-This man's absolutely right!
-Just shut up!

561
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,280
Why? Why should I go to Pakistan?

562
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,040
This is my home
as much as it's yours.

563
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,800
And I have the right to
voice my opinion!

564
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,600
Even prostitutes are better than
prostitutes who sell their own country!

565
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,360
-Hey, man!
-That is not right!

566
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,920
-Be civilized!
-You are talking to a woman.

567
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,440
Which political party's
payroll are you on, sir?

568
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,000
What gets you this angry?

569
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:12,960
Bloody whore!

570
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,280
-Hey!
-Hey!

571
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,240
-Hey!
-Hey!

572
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,200
Jeh!

573
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,480
Hold it! Jeh!

574
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,200
Jeh, don't get into this!
You go from here!

575
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,240
-You okay?
-I'm okay. You okay?

576
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,400
Moron! Go get an education first
and then a bloody job!

577
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,280
Stop being a political stooge!

578
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,960
And ever heard of
freedom of expression?

579
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,200
This is a democracy.

580
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,360
We can say whatever we want to!

581
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,480
-Exactly!
-Back off!

582
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,400
I was alone today.
Tomorrow, it will be you!

583
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,680
Look out for yourself, sir.

584
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,760
I have plenty of people who have my back!

585
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,760
Yeah!

586
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,080
Go, Damini!

587
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,800
Kudos!

588
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,520
Thank you!

589
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,920
-All right!
-Yeah!

590
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
To Damini...

591
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,680
whose mind is without fear
and head is held high.

592
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,040
Yeah!

593
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,480
-To Damini!
-To Damini!

594
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,840
That's good.

595
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,160
All right, ladies...

596
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,720
shots!

597
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,800
-No.
-Oh, God!

598
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,960
Jeh, are you okay?

599
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:06,880
Okay?

600
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,640
I'm deliriously happy! My girlfriend
is a best-selling author!

601
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,960
Jeh, we sold only
ninety-two copies. Please.

602
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,480
Today.
It'll be ninety-two thousand tomorrow.

603
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,600
-Yeah!
-Heights of optimism that is!

604
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,080
All right, ladies! Drink up! Drink up!

605
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,320
Come on, Dee.

606
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,480
Dee, I love you!
This is going to be amazing!

607
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,960
So good. So good!

608
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,920
Have some lime.

609
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,400
You okay?

610
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,760
Yeah, I'm great!

611
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,840
-It's the best day ever, right?
-Yes!

612
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,240
-Drink up, guys!
-All right!

613
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,760
Thank you!

614
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,760
What do you think?

615
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,880
You'll stop smoking, drinking,
eating Chinese food...

616
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,400
and he won't figure it out?

617
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,200
I don't want to lose him again.

618
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:57,000
But if he finds out from someone else,
you will actually lose him!

619
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,960
I know. I know.

620
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,160
Have you told Warsi?

621
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,240
Why should I tell Warsi?

622
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,320
Dee...

623
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,440
I'm going to raise
the baby myself. Alone.

624
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,880
Dee. He's the father of the child.

625
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,960
He has the right to know.

626
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,880
Sam?

627
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,280
Darkness and pain
had become a part of my life.

628
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,360
And then one day you suddenly
walked into my life...

629
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,920
and since then my life has
been full of light.

630
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,640
I just... I don't want to go
back to that darkness.

631
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,400
And you won't have to.

632
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,520
I know.

633
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,200
Because now... you're with me.

634
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,760
Which is why...

635
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,840
I want to make sure that...

636
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,200
we spend our lives together.

637
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,680
Umang Singh.

638
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,920
Will you marry me?

639
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,080
You're the Pranayam to
my Surya Namaskar.

640
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,960
-Sam.
-The bicep curl to my lunge.

641
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,400
You... you're the warm-up
to my marathon.

642
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,840
Okay, half marathon.

643
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,520
Because I can run the
full marathon with you.

644
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,400
All I want every day is to...

645
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:30,920
go to bed with you,
wake up next to you,

646
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,400
hit the gym together,

647
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,080
meditate in the most beautiful aromas.

648
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,320
And... make Kale smoothies with you.

649
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:45,280
Marry me because I can't wait
to spend the rest of my life with you.

650
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:50,160
Marry me so that we can
step only in light... together.

651
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,160
Marry me...

652
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,160
so that we can show the whole world
how much we love each other.

653
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,840
Yes.

654
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,120
So much enthusiasm?

655
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,840
-Yes! Yes! Yes!
-Yes? Yes!

656
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,920
Of course, yes!

657
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,080
Are you kidding me?

658
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,880
-Oh, my God!
-Oh God, I love you, baby.

659
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I love you so much.
