1
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,120
What's worse?

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,840
Mental rubbish or emotional rubbish?

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,280
When nonsense starts
making sense,

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,800
does it make more sense
to be senseless?

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,080
Should I fuck you or
should I just fuck it?

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,240
Why aren't you coming?

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,520
It's my wedding, Jeh.

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,560
I want you in my corner.

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,640
I want Dee in my corner.

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,120
I fucking need you both
in my corner!

11
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,360
I love how I'm stuck
between the two of you.

12
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,280
Jeh...

13
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,280
She loves you.

14
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,680
You know that, right?

15
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,040
Truly.

16
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,320
You're clearly very busy, so...

17
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,840
-Anj, what do I do?
-I've been calling him!

18
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,520
He hasn't even returned
my calls or texts!

19
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,160
Obviously, I'm trying to calm her down.

20
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,680
-What else do you think I'm doing?
-He's just wiped me out!

21
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,600
I don't even exist for him!

22
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,520
I don't know! He's just not...

23
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,600
-He's just not calling me back!
-Dee, it's fine. It's fine, okay?

24
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,840
-I'm here. I'll help you pack. Come.
-I... I...

25
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,160
-I'll pack for you.
-You...

26
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,600
-Will you teach me?
-Do you think he'll come for the wedding?

27
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,440
You invited him, right?

28
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,400
Maybe he'll come for you.
He doesn't give a shit about me!

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,880
I didn't do it on purpose!

30
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,320
I told him I'm sorry!

31
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,560
-But he still...
-Let me...let me help you, Dee.

32
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,000
-It's okay. Dee, it's fine!
-No. no, no!

33
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,840
Leave it!

34
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,280
Just leave it!

35
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,720
What are you standing here for?

36
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,200
Go open the door! Maybe it's Jeh!

37
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,720
Hey, Damini. I've got your
pre-natal meds for your trip.

38
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,760
What's wrong? What happened?

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,440
Talk to me. Talk to me.

40
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,160
Can't breathe.

41
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,440
Don't worry about it.
Close your eyes.

42
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,440
Just breathe.
Focus on your breathing.

43
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,000
Inhale through the nose.

44
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,520
C'mon, inhale through the nose.

45
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,600
One.

46
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,520
Two.

47
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,400
Breathe out.

48
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,880
One... two...

49
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,960
Again, c'mon.

50
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,280
Breathe in.
Exhale.

51
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,760
That's good.

52
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,360
Everything will be fine.

53
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,400
Feeling better?

54
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,840
Doc, do you think Dee should travel
in this condition?

55
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm fine, Mangs.

56
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,520
You're not fine, Dee.

57
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,120
And it breaks my heart
to say this but...

58
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,240
maybe you shouldn't come
to the wedding.

59
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,600
What is wrong with you?

60
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,960
It's your wedding, Mangs.
I have to be there.

61
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,040
And what if something happens to you
on my watch?

62
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,960
Nothing will happen to me.

63
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,200
-Dee, will you please just listen--
-No, I won't listen.

64
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,200
Hey, hey, guys!

65
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,280
What if I offer my presence?

66
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,240
What? No!

67
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,480
-As a doctor.
-No!

68
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,400
-No! Aamir, no!
-Damini, as a doctor.

69
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,560
That's a really good idea.

70
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,760
-No, Mangs.
-Doc, I'm officially inviting you.

71
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,640
-Please come to my wedding.
-Mangs, no. Please, no!

72
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,000
It's my wedding and
for your health,

73
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,480
my peace of mind, he's coming!

74
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,080
Oh my God.

75
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,680
-Wow! This place is amazing!
-Ya.

76
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,880
Cheer up, Dee.

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,240
Sids, you're matching
the environment.

78
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,080
I was built for royalty, guys.

79
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,600
I don't get it. Is this a wedding or a
social media circus?

80
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,920
God, Mangs!
A little perspective, please!

81
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,440
You're having a fairytale wedding.
That too, with Samara Kapoor!

82
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,520
So can you just shut up and smile!

83
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,360
Just shut up and smile!

84
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,880
Wow!

85
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,120
That's a camel!

86
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,000
-Where?
-Oh, my God!

87
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,880
Wow, Mangs! Full feels!

88
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,760
Guys! This is so much fun!

89
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,480
People arrive on horses.
You'll be arriving on a camel!

90
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,720
Come meet Mama.

91
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,600
This is Ava.

92
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,760
Hi, Aunt Ava.

93
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,880
Don't call me auntie.

94
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,520
You can call me Mama.

95
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,920
Now, now...

96
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,760
-This is my sister-in-law, Caroline.
-Hi!

97
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,160
-These little munchkins are my nieces.
-Hi!

98
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,480
-That's my brother over there, Sidharth.
-Hi!

99
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,160
-This is Maya, my crazy sister.
-You're family now.

100
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,680
And her long suffering boyfriend, Ben!

101
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,360
Oh, my God!
This is incredible! So much fun!

102
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,640
Guys, this is my family.

103
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,080
-This is Siddhi.
-Hi!

104
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,440
-This is Damini.
-Hi!

105
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,640
-And this is Anjana.
-Hi!

106
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,200
Nice to see you girls.

107
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,280
Hi! How are you?
Thank you.

108
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,400
Are you getting it?
You're getting it, right?

109
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,400
Come, come, let's all pose together
for the photographers.

110
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,560
Okay.

111
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,240
Come, come.
Come to the centre.

112
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,280
-Come to the centre.
-Come, come, come.

113
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,000
-Mama, come.
-Ready?

114
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,360
Smile!

115
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,240
Umara.

116
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,720
Umara!

117
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,240
-The wedding has begun!
-Yay! Feels so good!

118
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,760
Anywhere you look,
there's a camera!

119
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,080
Feels more like a reality show
than a wedding.

120
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,520
Mangs, calm down.

121
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,800
I get that all this is new for you.
And for us.

122
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,520
But, this is Samara's life.

123
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,600
Oh, shit!

124
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,120
Anj, are you fucking kidding me?

125
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,720
Mangs, I haven't invited him.

126
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,120
Why would I call my secret affair
to a celebrity wedding?

127
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,040
Calm down.

128
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,080
If neither you nor Mangs invited him,

129
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,600
then why the hell is he here?

130
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,840
Oh, shit.

131
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,360
Shashank.

132
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,280
C'mon, darling, Umang's here.

133
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,640
-Come meet her.
-Oh, shit. That's Sushmita, his wife.

134
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,320
Sam is going to kill me.

135
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,040
Mangs, you were right.

136
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,440
This is not a wedding.
This is a reality show.

137
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,800
Sush!

138
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,120
Hey!

139
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,320
Sush!

140
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,680
Umang, Umang!
Sush meet Umang.

141
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,600
Umang.

142
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,160
-You have to meet Sushmita.
-So lovely to meet you.

143
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,840
-Congratulations!
-Thank you.

144
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,000
This is Sush, my roommate from
Boston University.

145
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,720
Oh. Sushmita from college!

146
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,080
-I've heard a lot about you.
-That's me.

147
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,440
-Hi, Anjana.
-Hi, Shashank.

148
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,400
-How's it going?
-Going well.

149
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,720
-Damini, you've met...
-From the publisher's party.

150
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,160
-Yes, I do. And you are?
-That's Siddhi.

151
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,840
-Siddhi. And you?
-Shashank.

152
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,360
-Shashank.
-Nice to meet you.

153
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,640
-Anjana.
-Hi...

154
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,240
So lovely to finally meet you.

155
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,520
-Lovely to meet you, too.
-Hi.

156
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,000
-Hi, how are you? Nice to meet you.
-That's Damini, Siddhi.

157
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,200
Guys, I'm going to go check-in.

158
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,440
-Ya, sure.
-Okay, come guys.

159
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,120
-Let me know if you need anything at all.
-Come, let's go.

160
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,000
-I'll catch up with you guys in a second.
-Ya.

161
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,720
Okay, just make sure
they're comfortable.

162
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,160
Damini.

163
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,000
Siddhi.

164
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,320
Siddhi Patel.

165
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,640
Thank you.

166
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,320
So creepy.

167
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,040
It's one thing to be with him
in a hotel room or at work.

168
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,520
And a totally different thing
to be around his wife.

169
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,600
Anj, it's an open marriage.

170
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,000
Shashank must've told her about you.

171
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,640
Besides, you never know.

172
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,280
He might just call you
for a fun threesome!

173
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,760
-Yuck!
-Siddhi!

174
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,440
If I had to disappoint
two people at once,

175
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,160
I'd rather go and spend a weekend
with my parents.

176
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,120
Just stay away from him please.

177
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,600
Listen, I hate to say this
but I told you so.

178
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,360
Guys, this was supposed
to be a fun escape!

179
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,000
Nothing is a fun escape anymore.

180
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,440
Okay listen, Dee I think
I'm shifting with you.

181
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,880
I'm not leaving you alone.

182
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,880
Wow. First Warsi, then you.

183
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,880
I have so many caretakers.

184
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,600
-So blessed.
-Yes, you are.

185
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,160
But for a fact.
Isn't Warsi hotter than us as a caretaker?

186
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,640
Excuse me, speak for yourself.

187
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm a Goddess.

188
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,400
I agree.

189
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,200
Yay! What's up?

190
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,600
Woah! What's up, bro?

191
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,760
How was your flight?

192
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,760
Not bad. Just a little tired.

193
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,200
-Hey, Mihir. Hi.
-Hi, how are you?

194
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,640
-Hi.
-Hi, how are you?

195
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,720
I had to invite him.
I know you're not over him.

196
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,760
Of course I'm over him, Mangs.

197
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,760
Then, why do you keep stalking
him on social media?

198
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,120
Have you lost your mind?

199
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,640
I don't stalk him. I just want
to see whether he's moved on or not.

200
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,520
That's it.

201
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,960
And why does it matter to you?

202
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,880
It doesn't.

203
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,120
I was dating Amit, right?

204
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,040
That's proof that
I don't care about Mihir.

205
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,720
You do care about Mihir.

206
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,040
That's why the minute Amit
started getting serious,

207
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,480
you panicked!

208
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,880
And let's be honest.
Amit was your rebound.

209
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,880
So bloody what?

210
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,720
Every-- Everybody has a rebound.

211
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,840
What's wrong with that?

212
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,640
Sids, you need closure.

213
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,480
And this is why I invited Mihir.

214
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,640
Maybe he needs closure as well.

215
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,720
And that's why he's here.

216
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,080
No, Mangs.
You should've asked me.

217
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,960
I know you would've said no.

218
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,640
-Exactly!
-Exactly.

219
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,880
Shit!

220
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,600
You scared me!
What's wrong with you, Shashank?

221
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,600
Leave me.
Leave my hand!

222
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,960
What can I say?

223
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,160
You drive me crazy.

224
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,080
You knew I was going
to be at the wedding.

225
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,720
I took four days off.

226
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,960
You didn't find it important
to mention that you were coming,

227
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,520
and that too with your wife?

228
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,080
I couldn't stay away from you.

229
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,760
And I wanted to surprise you.

230
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,240
Surprise me?

231
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,280
How twisted are you?

232
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,880
I'm not twisted, I just want to--

233
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,240
Shashank!

234
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,480
Doesn't it bother you that you're going to
be with me now and later with your wife?

235
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,200
As far as I remember,
we've spoken about this and...

236
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,760
things are cool, right?

237
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,720
I don't think I'm
very cool with all this.

238
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,600
This is all getting too sordid for me.

239
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,800
And being in the hotel
room wasn't sordid for you?

240
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,600
Shashank, she is right here.

241
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,560
She's in the hotel somewhere.

242
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,120
I'll have to see her face
after I've been with her husband.

243
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,040
Till now she was this
intangible concept for me.

244
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,800
So, you're going to break my heart
and call this a... no touch weekend?

245
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,760
Yes.

246
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,920
Are you sure?

247
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,040
Yes.

248
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,920
Don't be such a prude.

249
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,000
Look, I didn't know
that you didn't know.

250
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,920
I know.

251
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,400
-I can leave if you--
-Do you want to leave?

252
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,720
Do you want me to leave?

253
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,760
What do you want?

254
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,320
Really?

255
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,160
Then, why did you come at all?

256
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,920
How are your parents?

257
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,600
Good.

258
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,120
Papa was upset for a while but...

259
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,120
we're fine now.

260
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,280
That's good.

261
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,000
I... I mean about the reconciliation.
Not that he was upset.

262
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,160
And your... parents?

263
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,320
My mom left him.

264
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,680
But she's refusing to move to New York.

265
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,680
Says her life is here in Mumbai.

266
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,760
Siddhi, I missed you.

267
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,920
Mihir, nothing is the same anymore.

268
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,480
But we're still where we were, right?

269
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:14,520
No... I don't even know where I am.

270
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,880
I feel like a girl in transit.

271
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,560
With a...

272
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,800
stopover in my city?

273
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,120
Do I need a visa?

274
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,880
You have a lifetime visa on arrival.

275
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,480
Coffee?

276
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,360
Let's go.

277
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,080
Oh, my God!

278
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,280
I missed you so much.

279
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,520
-I missed you.
-I missed you, too.

280
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,000
Are you still upset about the wedding?
There's only 30 people.

281
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,920
That's like 28 too many.

282
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,040
Just one for me.

283
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,200
-Who's that? Who's that?
-Well, I'm looking at her.

284
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,200
-I'm looking at her.
-Me? Is that me?

285
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,200
Just... wait here. One second.

286
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,680
Ma'am, your radio interview
is scheduled for 04:00 p.m.

287
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,400
Okay, thanks.

288
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,000
Okay.

289
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,000
-Where were we?
-Here.

290
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,200
I'm so happy you're here.

291
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,360
Ya? What is it?

292
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,040
Ma'am, costume trial for the
pre-wedding shoot.

293
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,320
Oh damn, I forgot.

294
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,560
I'll be there in five.

295
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,800
What shoot is this now?

296
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,760
Baby, it's our bridal photoshoot.

297
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,120
I told you about it.

298
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,320
When?

299
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,160
Just give me a second, okay?

300
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,280
Okay, yes.
Look, one second.

301
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,880
Sam, they're calling you
for the video chat interview.

302
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,120
-Now?
-Yes, right now.

303
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,600
-Okay, I'm coming.
-Okay.

304
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,560
Umang, just start the costume trial.

305
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,120
I'll quickly wrap up the interview.

306
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,360
Need any help?

307
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,520
No, thank you.

308
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,320
I should take folding
lessons from you.

309
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,360
Hey, little one.
It's me, your dad.

310
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,360
Be gentle on your mom, okay?

311
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:49,760
No acid reflux, no gas,
no back pain.

312
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,440
Can they hear?

313
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,360
Well, some theories say they can.

314
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,600
But this was more for you.

315
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,720
Just relax.

316
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,800
I've got you.

317
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,240
Would you like some tea?

318
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,600
-Make you a cup?
-Ya, maybe.

319
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,480
Chamomile, coming up.

320
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,680
I feel completely rested, rejuvenated.

321
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,000
And you know, to be completely
accepted for who I am...

322
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,280
is the greatest gift
that my fans could give me.

323
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,200
-Ma'am...
-I'm so grateful.

324
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,480
Samara ma'am has chosen
these three outfits for you.

325
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:30,360
Is it normal to feel lonely
at one's own wedding?

326
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,320
-Oh!
-Oh!

327
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,720
Anjana.

328
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,120
I am so sorry.

329
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,760
No, no.
It's great bumping into you.

330
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,600
I mean, quite literally of course.

331
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,960
Great.
See you.

332
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,680
You know, I've heard a lot
about you from Shashank.

333
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,600
It's funny but I feel like
I already know you.

334
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,520
But I don't, do I?

335
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,200
No, I guess.

336
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,720
Let's fix that.

337
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,000
Drink?

338
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,880
Oh, my God. Baby, I'm so sorry
this took so much time.

339
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,360
I miss you.

340
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,000
I really miss you so much.

341
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,520
You're so busy. Do you even have
the time to miss me?

342
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,080
It's a lot of work to put
together this wedding, baby.

343
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,240
-Is that what you chose?
-Ya.

344
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,760
It's gorgeous.

345
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,960
Let's get ready, okay?

346
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,640
Let's get ready for the next shoot.

347
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,760
My outfit's in here.

348
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,440
Wine?

349
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,320
It's 11 in the morning.

350
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,720
C'mon, it's a wedding.

351
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,800
That means we get to drink all day.

352
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,440
Hi, two glasses of
Cabernet Sauvignon please.

353
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,320
Sure, ma'am.

354
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,680
So, tell me.
How's it going at the firm?

355
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,960
Shashank must be working you hard.

356
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,720
Ya. No, he's very chilled out.

357
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,480
He's great.

358
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,560
I am sure he is.

359
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,240
I hear you guys make a great team.

360
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,720
Thanks.

361
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,040
You have a daughter, don't you?

362
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,280
Ya. She's four.

363
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,320
And how does she
handle the late nights?

364
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,400
On those nights,
she stays with her dad.

365
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,800
So, you're separated?

366
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,760
Separated, divorced and
he's remarried.

367
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,320
Thank you.
You want another one?

368
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,680
-Husband?
-Oh God, no!

369
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,800
No. I wouldn't wish that on anyone.

370
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,760
I meant a child.

371
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,080
No. One and done.

372
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,480
Ya. Well, I know how that goes.

373
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,000
It's none and done for us.

374
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,720
And I think we just
value our freedom too much.

375
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,480
To just be, do as we please.

376
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,040
You know, I always wonder...

377
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,440
Does freedom exist in the
construct of marriage?

378
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,960
My marriage was a complete lockdown.

379
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,800
Well, you need to communicate with
each other about your needs and...

380
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,520
of course, honesty is super important.

381
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,200
You know.

382
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,280
Guys, wait for me.

383
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,200
C'mon.

384
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,560
Hey, look at that one.

385
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,560
C'mon, everybody, all eyes here.

386
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,680
It's kho-kho time!

387
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,920
-We're going to have Team A and Team B.
-What?

388
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,240
Mihir, Maya, Ben, Sushmita in Team A.

389
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,000
Hey! C'mon, let's play.

390
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,880
I've been in way too many parent races
courtesy Arya's school.

391
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,800
So, thank you.

392
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,520
You'll be in my team. We'll win.
Let's go, c'mon.

393
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,520
-Shashank, what's wrong with you?
-It'll be fun. Let's go!

394
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,240
-Take your hand off.
-Okay, okay, let's play.

395
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,200
Take your shoes off
and you'll be fine.

396
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,680
-And this dress?
-I'll give you my jacket.

397
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,080
What about you?

398
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,040
What about me?

399
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,080
If you want a normal delivery,
squats are great for your pelvic muscles.

400
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,320
C'mon! Let's do it!

401
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,640
C'mon! We're winning this one!

402
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,680
Run! Run! Run!
Come on, guys! Come on!

403
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,800
Guys! My turn.
C'mon, guys! C'mon!

404
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,480
I'm getting you!
Shashank!

405
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,560
There you are!

406
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,160
Go, Shashank go!

407
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,920
Tag someone!
Anj!

408
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,400
-Let go!
-Go!

409
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Go, Sush!

410
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,680
Sush, tag someone!

411
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,800
Tag someone, Sush!

412
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,080
-Sush, tag someone!
-Sushmita!

413
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,000
Oh, c'mon!

414
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,880
Sushmita, tag someone!

415
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,520
Tag someone!

416
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,080
Tag someone, Sush!
You have to tag someone!

417
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,080
I feel like a mannequin.

418
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,440
You're anything but a mannequin,
my Ludhianvi live wire.

419
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,320
Lovely!

420
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,040
How about the two of you
get a little closer?

421
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,000
Like this.

422
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:55,440
We haven't been close for a minute
since we got here.

423
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,640
Weddings are hectic.

424
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,320
Brides, move to the steps.
And show me you're in love!

425
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,080
Now, I have to show her that I'm in love?

426
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,760
She's just giving directions, okay?

427
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,160
-Here?
-Yes.

428
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,920
-Centre?
-Yes.

429
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,720
What am I even doing here?

430
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,160
You're just being your
usual sulky self, obviously.

431
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,880
Dorothy, there's shine on
Umang's forehead.

432
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,520
Mayank, move the light this side.

433
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,560
-I'll click you till then.
-Come. Take some.

434
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,040
Hey!

435
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,320
What happened?

436
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,800
Umang. Baby.
Hang on!

437
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,240
Baby!

438
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,800
Tag me, Sushmita!

439
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,080
C'mon, Sushmita!

440
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,920
C'mon, Sushmita!
Sushmita, tag someone!

441
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,280
C'mon! C'mon!

442
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,040
-C'mon!
-Tag!

443
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,840
-C'mon!
-Tag.

444
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Sushmita, tag anybody.

445
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,920
-Sushmita!
-Sushmita, tag.

446
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,200
Please!

447
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,880
-Tag someone.
-What's going on!

448
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,680
What the hell?

449
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,680
Please stop.

450
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,600
No, no, no!

451
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,800
Fuck!

452
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,800
-Anj, are you okay?
-Anj!

453
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,080
-You okay?
-Anj!

454
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,120
Anj, are you okay?

455
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,800
Stop it!
I've had enough.

456
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,800
Why do you even want to get married?

457
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,760
So, you can trend on social media?

458
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,800
How can you even say such a thing?

459
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,000
Really?

460
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,080
Really?

461
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,600
This is a goddamn circus!

462
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,720
These interviews, these photoshoots,
these non-stop live feeds!

463
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,520
It's like a circus!

464
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,920
Listen. These things have to be done.

465
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,400
I just wish that you would
stop behaving like a teenager!

466
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,240
-God!
-Why? Why?

467
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,240
Because it's good for your career?

468
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,520
Because it's going to keep you
in the news?

469
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,520
Ya. Ya!
You know what?

470
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,880
It is good for my career
and it will keep me in the news.

471
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,680
What's wrong with that?

472
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,760
Have you forgotten about
something called privacy?

473
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,040
A sense of belonging? Love?

474
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,760
It's hashtag Umara,
Umara, Umara all over.

475
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,640
Does Umara even exist between us?

476
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,480
Since we've come here,

477
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,560
I haven't had a minute to
look at your face, Sam.

478
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,000
You're looking at it now, okay?

479
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,240
And that's what the
honeymoon is for, baby.

480
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,560
You have no idea how self-centered
you sound right now.

481
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,720
It's amazing.

482
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,760
So do you!

483
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,720
Umang!

484
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,520
Babe, listen.
We need to talk!

485
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,520
I can't keep chasing you.

486
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,200
Darlings.

487
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,160
Where have you been?

488
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,160
We're having so much fun.

489
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,040
Come with us.
Come.

490
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,200
Okay.

491
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,320
Mom, mom!
Wait. Listen.

492
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,920
I'll... I'll catch up with you.
In a minute.

493
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,240
In a minute. Enjoy.

494
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,160
How bad?

495
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,920
Did everyone hear that?

496
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,120
Ya, pretty much.

497
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,440
Listen, it's okay.

498
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,080
Wedding stress.
It's totally understandable.

499
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,960
Are you two okay?

500
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,520
Anything we can do
to take the load off?

501
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,280
No, we're fine.

502
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,160
We should...

503
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,920
Ya, just take a break.

504
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,760
Okay.

505
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,560
Oh, my God!

506
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,560
I'm sorry!

507
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,080
When that girl was pounding my
face with powder, I lost it.

508
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,520
I just lost it.

509
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,440
I'm sorry, too.

510
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,160
You should be sorry.

511
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,080
Hey!

512
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,080
-What?
-Shut up.

513
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,840
-You shut up.
-You shut up.

514
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,000
Best outfits to snuggle in.

515
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,600
-I'm sorry about that.
-The best.

516
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,520
I don't want to fight.

517
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,600
Got it.

518
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,840
Just make sure you give me
some cake after this.

519
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,200
Like butterscotch.
Like red velvet.

520
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,880
-One minute. Hang on.
-Okay!

521
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,400
So one, two, three and four.

522
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,280
-Five, six, seven and eight.
-Seven and eight.

523
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,600
-And twice.
-Twice.

524
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,880
This, too.

525
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,760
This hand is straight?

526
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,560
Guys, I think Mihir
wants to get back with me.

527
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,440
You know, Warsi keeps
talking to the baby.

528
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,520
It's so weird.

529
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,520
And what's with that Sushmita?

530
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,480
She's just being competitive, Anj.

531
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,960
Shashank must've told her
that you're awesome in bed.

532
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,400
Are you?

533
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,840
Shut up.

534
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,360
Guys...

535
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,440
I don't want to do this.

536
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,760
I need some wine.

537
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,720
And I shouldn't have any more wine.

538
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,720
God, I miss wine.
I can't have wine.

539
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,280
I could do with some pizza though.

540
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,360
Shall we order?

541
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,400
Guys, we're going to suck
so bad at the dance.

542
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,520
We will need wine and pizza both.

543
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,960
-Oh, my God! Look at Mom!
-So cute!

544
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,120
Yay!

545
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,920
Hi!

546
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,800
I love you! I love you!

547
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,320
Ya!

548
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,720
That was amazing!

549
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,440
Such a wonderful performance
by Samara's family.

550
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,440
You guys were all so good!

551
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,320
Love you!

552
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,640
Now, put your hands
together for Umang's family.

553
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,680
Siddhi, Anjana, Damini,
can we please have you on stage?

554
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,400
What!

555
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,240
Go Mihir! Let's go!

556
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,320
This is my family!

557
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,800
All of them are my best friends.

558
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,160
I love them.

559
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,760
Now we'll have on stage...

560
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,400
Guys, I love you so much!

561
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,080
...the bride and bride.

562
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,360
Congratulations.

563
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,400
Get a room, Mangs!

564
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,560
-Amazing!
-Was it good?

565
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,320
Superb!

566
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,520
I'll just come.

567
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,800
Your hard work has paid off!

568
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,720
Double celebrations
when you're back!

569
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,440
We love you, Damini!

570
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,640
Jeh...

571
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,560
The number you have dialed is busy.
Please try later.

572
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,760
What happened?

573
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,560
Bad news?

574
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,920
Good news, actually.

575
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,000
What?

576
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,440
My book just made it to the
top ten bestsellers.

577
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,040
Wow! That's amazing!

578
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,760
-Congratulations!
-Thank you.

579
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,560
-Let's go tell everyone.
-No.

580
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,440
-C'mon!
-No! It's Umang's night.

581
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,400
Not now.

582
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,560
I'll tell them after the wedding.

583
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,560
Anju.

584
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,000
I love you. I love you.

585
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,120
I love my Anju. I love my Anju.

586
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,440
Tell me something.

587
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:55,040
If there's guilt,
why don't you end it once and for all?

588
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,360
I don't think this is you at all.

589
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,000
Am I wrong?

590
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,520
What's going on?

591
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,640
Come, let's dance.

592
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,320
What do you want, Damini?

593
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,440
What do you want?

594
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,480
I thought I knew everything I wanted.

595
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:18,880
Ya.

596
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,000
Now, I just want to be happy.

597
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,160
Don't go turning into a shrink.

598
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,840
I need you to be my friend.

599
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,440
I am your friend.

600
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,080
But.

601
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,920
Truth be told...

602
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:42,680
The first time you
left me for that boy,

603
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,760
it hurt.

604
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,000
And the second time,

605
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,200
it hurt a bit much.

606
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,400
Why do you keep calling him
"that boy"?

607
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,280
Trying to dismiss
the competition, I guess.

608
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,560
He's not competition.

609
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:09,240
You mean, I'm not
his competition, right?

610
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,920
You know, Damini...

611
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:20,560
Heartbreaks are painful.

612
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,760
But when you hear your
baby cry for the first time,

613
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:28,560
you'll forget all your pain.

614
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,680
At least that's what I've heard.

615
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,400
I don't have any children of my own.

616
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,760
At least not those I know of.

617
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,680
Who knows, maybe one day, an 18-year-old
will land up at my doorstep...

618
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,280
saying, " Hello, Daddy!"

619
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:50,480
I must make my will really fast
and leave everything to this one.

620
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,040
It's so quiet here.

621
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,880
You can hear the silence.

622
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,600
I don't feel like
going back to Mumbai.

623
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,400
So, don't.

624
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,080
And do what?

625
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,600
I've already backpacked through Europe
on Sneha's money...

626
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,960
and this stand-up barely pays.

627
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,600
Because this is just the first step.

628
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,640
Better your skills.

629
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,040
Do a comedy writing course.

630
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,400
Don't be silly.

631
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,400
I just found out that I can be funny.

632
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,160
But I always knew.

633
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,280
You know what, come to New York.

634
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,360
The birthplace of stand-up.

635
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,680
-Are you crazy?
-Seriously.

636
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,520
Check this out.

637
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,640
One search and I've already found four
different one year courses in New York.

638
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,120
See.

639
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,600
-One year diploma course.
-Ya.

640
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,080
It's 15,000 dollars, Mihir!
Have you lost it?

641
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,160
I can't ask Papa for
this kind of money.

642
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,440
Take it from me.

643
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,040
And...

644
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,840
And you can stay with me.

645
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,280
See Mihir, this is what
I'm talking about.

646
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,440
What?

647
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,920
Why do you want to save me?

648
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,760
I'm not some damsel-in-distress
that needs saving.

649
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,360
Siddi-Piddi, I'm saving myself.

650
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,400
I'm being selfish.

651
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,920
I want you to move to
New York so that...

652
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,520
so that we can have a chance
at being together again.

653
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,640
Mihir, why don't you just move
on, please?

654
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,600
Have you?

655
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Mihir, I think the reason I haven't
moved on is because of what happened.

656
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,600
Not because of what I feel for you.

657
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,400
Sorry.

658
00:35:53,440 --> 00:36:00,040
Well then, I guess there's
nothing else left to say.

659
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,600
So, I have been offered the
Head of Department position...

660
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,440
at the Singapore Central Hospital.

661
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,960
Wow, Aamir! That's amazing!

662
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,280
And you were celebrating my news.
Such a martyr.

663
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,640
I leave in two months.

664
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,760
Don't worry,
we'll figure out something.

665
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,440
You can come down to
Mumbai sometimes.

666
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,840
Sometimes the baby and I
can come see you in Singapore.

667
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,600
Come with me.

668
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,160
What? Don't be silly.

669
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,120
Why not?

670
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,600
Singapore is one of the
best places to bring up a child.

671
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,080
The best health care, best
educational facilities, large parks.

672
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,560
I can't just leave Mumbai.

673
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,640
Why not?

674
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:08,000
Listen, I thought I'd made it clear
that we were...

675
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,760
We are just co-parents.

676
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,880
Of course, we'll be co-parents.

677
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,520
I mean, we'll just be a
really modern family.

678
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,320
Together, yet separate.

679
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,800
And you can write your
books and articles from anywhere.

680
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,440
Isn't that right?

681
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,600
Think about it.

682
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,080
Babe listen, I'll be back.

683
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,920
-Just some wedding stuff.
-Okay.

684
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,800
Okay, I think we're done.

685
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,160
Let me see.

686
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,600
It's a beautiful night, isn't it?

687
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,640
Done taking selfies with your wife?

688
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:50,000
Do you realize you look even
more gorgeous when you're jealous?

689
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,480
I'm not jealous, Shashank.

690
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,360
And I so want to kiss you
right now.

691
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,680
Shashank, please. Please!
I'm very uncomfortable...

692
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,800
and confused about this whole thing!

693
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,080
Let me make it okay.

694
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,920
Let me make it okay.

695
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,960
-Shashank, please!
-What the hell!

696
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,280
What the fuck is going on?
