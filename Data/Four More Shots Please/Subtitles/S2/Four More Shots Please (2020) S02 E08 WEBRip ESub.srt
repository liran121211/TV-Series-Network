1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,080
Day-night.
Light-shade.

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,040
Hookup-breakup.

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,800
It's a vicious cycle.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,800
Till you put a full stop to it or...
a ring on it.

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,800
Ellipses are the worst.

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,200
Yay!

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,680
Alright!

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,840
Alright, ladies.
A toast to our wildfire Umang.

9
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,240
Keep shining.
May you never be tamed.

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,120
-To Umang!
-To Umang!

11
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,120
To me!

12
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,120
-Thank you.
-Hashtag FitBrideHitBride!

13
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,400
This is going to be epic, Umang!

14
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,760
And I'm not going to be
the bartender at your wedding.

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,440
Guys, do any of you feel like
we're rushing into things?

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,600
Maybe we should've lived in first.

17
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,880
Both of you love each other, right?

18
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:51,840
Ya.

19
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,680
And you're sure that she's the one?

20
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,880
Mangs!
She swept you off your feet!

21
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,640
You're blushing.

22
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,760
-It doesn't get better than this.
-Ya!

23
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,920
Don't overthink it.

24
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,480
You guys...

25
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:07,880
Fuck!

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,520
I'm getting married!

27
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,360
-And to the right person!
-Yes!

28
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,200
To the best person, bro.
To the best person.

29
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,760
Dibs on maid of honor duties!

30
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,760
Okay.

31
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,800
-We're also there, right?
-She will take away

32
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,040
She is gonna, yes she's gonna
Mangs is gonna take the bride away!

33
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:28,080
She is gonna, yes she's gonna
Mangs is gonna take the bride away!

34
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,160
Oh, my God!

35
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,880
Babe, look!
I've found our wedding venue!

36
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,880
And, it's available
on the dates that we want.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,160
Oh, my God. I can't believe it.

38
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,280
Where is this?

39
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,080
It's in Udaipur.

40
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,320
We're getting married in Udaipur?

41
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,280
Yes.

42
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,280
Otherwise, the paps
are going to bother us.

43
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,240
Honestly,
I haven't even thought that far.

44
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,360
Why do we need to go
all the way there?

45
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,760
We can do a palatial wedding even here.

46
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,400
We'll hang up huge chandeliers.

47
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,360
On our wedding day,
we'll make a grand entry in a vintage car.

48
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,560
In style.

49
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,760
That's how we do it in Punjab.

50
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,880
Same sex marriages
are not even legal here yet.

51
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,720
Section 377 has just been repealed.

52
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,120
We'd have to go
to London to legalize it because…

53
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,080
I'm a British citizen.

54
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,080
Umang... trust me it'll be great.

55
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,760
What do you think?
I love it!

56
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,040
I can't afford this.

57
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,640
I'm buying it, my love.

58
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,960
This wedding.

59
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,120
I'm paying for that, too.

60
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,720
And we won't discuss this again, please.

61
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,120
Please.

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,720
Listen, I can't stop myself.

63
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,880
Stop, Shashank.
There's a camera.

64
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,520
Okay, fine.
Let's go.

65
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,400
It's right here.

66
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,840
-What are you saying?
-I'm saying that you've got to listen.

67
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,680
It says clearly that if either party
walks out before the initial lock in...

68
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,800
of five years, then 10% of the exiting
party's shares will be forfeited.

69
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,320
Look here.

70
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,720
Not if we prove a trust deficit.

71
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,360
Ya, but Basil Infra was unaware of
the offshore accounts.

72
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,320
Their reputation was put in jeopardy.

73
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,360
Exactly. That's what I'm saying.

74
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,520
What about us?

75
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,160
We, as always, are going to
make a huge fee out of this.

76
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,520
I meant, what about us?

77
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:58,000
What if one of us wants
to exit from this arrangement?

78
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,520
We won't stop each other.

79
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,920
No questions asked.

80
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,720
So, what we have is in the now?

81
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,440
No future and... no expectations.

82
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,080
Glad to know
we're on the same page.

83
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,600
Actually, you skipped a page.

84
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,360
We're on page 19 of the contract.

85
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,360
Yes?

86
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,120
Ya, just got late at work.

87
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,840
No, I've eaten.

88
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,760
Ya, I'll get that done.
Sure.

89
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,880
Don't wait up.

90
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,400
Okay. Bye.

91
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,320
So, I'm dealing with a few changes
in my life these days.

92
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,200
For one, I bathe everyday.

93
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,160
Bunch of hygienic people in the house.

94
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,120
And occasionally, I wash my hair, too.

95
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,640
With this this really nice
mint green tea shampoo.

96
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,480
So good I feel like drinking it!

97
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,840
I want my hair to be like Shoaib Akhtar's.

98
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,240
You see...

99
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,960
Now,

100
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,200
I have a girlfriend.

101
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,320
Oh!

102
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,640
Not imaginary. A real one.

103
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,240
In fact, she's right here.

104
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,480
In flesh and blood.

105
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,840
Hey there, girlfriend.

106
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,280
He... he means a friend
who happens to be a girl.

107
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,680
No. I mean a girlfriend.

108
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,360
I call my female friends, friends.

109
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,200
Why are you talking like my mother?

110
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,200
No, I... I just mean, is it necessary
to tag every relationship?

111
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,200
Yes!

112
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,400
We're Indians.

113
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,360
We label our water
bottles and lunch boxes.

114
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,120
Why leave relationships out?

115
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,320
So, I'm a water bottle?

116
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,200
Sure. You quench my thirst.

117
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,840
So my girlfriend, Siddhi and I, we--

118
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,800
My friend, Siddhi and I...

119
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,160
What kind of friend?

120
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,040
I think we should
ask the audience now.

121
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,960
Audience?

122
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,720
Girlfriend! Girlfriend! Girlfriend!

123
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,200
No! A friend!

124
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,680
I don't sleep with my friends.

125
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,000
Oh. So, everyone you sleep with
is your girlfriend?

126
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,640
Leaving aside one night stands, yes.

127
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,360
Right. And how many one night stands
have you had exactly?

128
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,040
A few!

129
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,760
None?

130
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,360
Girlfriends are always right.

131
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,640
In no time, she already knows me
like no one else.

132
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,920
And that's why I love her, folks!

133
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,320
By the way, you've been a great audience.
Have a wonderful night. Thank you.

134
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,280
Siddhi!

135
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,360
Siddhi!

136
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,440
Shit. Shit. Shit!

137
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,800
What do you think about this?

138
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,600
No, I like it.
I just don't like the sleeves.

139
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,160
-We can cut it out.
-We can cut it, right?

140
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,320
No problem.

141
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,920
-Hey, baby!
-Hi.

142
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,520
-Hi, how are you?
-I'm good.

143
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,160
What's all this?

144
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,440
Only Brides is making a...

145
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,120
behind-the-scenes feature.

146
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,960
A feature of?

147
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,760
Of our wedding.

148
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,320
Of course.

149
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,120
Of us designing our trousseau
and planning our events.

150
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,520
It's all going to be released online.

151
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,040
Our wedding?

152
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,960
Guys, give me five minutes.

153
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,040
Come inside.
We'll just have a drink.

154
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,640
-Have something.
-Sure.

155
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,000
Look, baby. The magazine is paying a lot
for our wedding.

156
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,040
Both, behind-the-scenes
and the front cover.

157
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,320
The wedding issue front cover!

158
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,000
It's going to cover 50%
of our wedding costs.

159
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,760
It's my wedding, too.

160
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,520
You haven't even asked me.

161
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,880
Because I knew you'd be uncomfortable.

162
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:14,240
Baby, listen. I have dreamt of a
fairy-tale wedding my whole life.

163
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,120
Perfect partner.
A beautiful gown.

164
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,840
Gorgeous backdrop.
Surrounded by all the people who love me.

165
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,760
That dream's coming true.
With you.

166
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,000
You're my soulmate.
You're my everything.

167
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,760
But it's costing a bomb.

168
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,040
So, if I have to sell my soul
just a little for a fairy tale wedding,

169
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,520
is that really such a bad thing?

170
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,240
No.

171
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,040
Of course it's not.

172
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,960
I mean...

173
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,880
If you really want this...
this big fancy wedding,

174
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,280
of course you can have it.

175
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,440
Look at you.
Of course, I'm in.

176
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,360
Damini?

177
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,200
Hi.

178
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,960
Aamir...

179
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,840
I'm pregnant.

180
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,280
And it's yours.
As in, you're the father.

181
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,760
I'm not here to dump
any of this onto you.

182
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,080
But I just thought I'll tell you that...

183
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,040
I've decided to have the baby.

184
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,320
I thought about it over and over.

185
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,000
Whether to keep the baby,
or terminate the pregnancy.

186
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,240
And then, I thought perhaps life
has its own plans for me.

187
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,880
I'm telling you because...
it's your baby, too.

188
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,840
You have the right to know.

189
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,480
It would be nice if you...

190
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,880
if you could...

191
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,320
be a part of the baby's life.

192
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,240
But if you choose not to, I'll...

193
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,080
I'll respect that.

194
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,440
And if you don't want this baby
to ever know of you,

195
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,200
I'll respect that, too.
As I said, no expectations at all.

196
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,840
How many weeks is it?
Seven?

197
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,560
Eight weeks.

198
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,560
You know Damini...

199
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,440
Almost my entire life
I've spent delivering babies.

200
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,600
Everyday.

201
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,520
I just give them away.
I never see them again.

202
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,080
I've never seen myself
as a father.

203
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,920
Aamir, it's fine.
As I said, it's totally fine.

204
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,800
I'm in.

205
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,520
Think about it.

206
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,960
Think about what?

207
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,480
It's our baby.
I'm in.

208
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,640
And you know Damini,
maybe you're right.

209
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,320
Maybe this was meant to be.

210
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,480
That we do this together.
As partners.

211
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:10,920
Just to be clear,
as partners you mean co-parents, right?

212
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,360
And nothing more?

213
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,800
Don't worry, Damini.

214
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,960
I know that special seat's taken.

215
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,280
To being co-parents.

216
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,920
Are you sure Warsi's okay
being just a co-parent?

217
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,720
And nothing else?

218
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,120
To be doubly sure,
I asked him again.

219
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,120
He said yes.

220
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,320
Confirm it on WhatsApp.

221
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,960
So you have a screenshot of it.

222
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,760
Who knows, he may ambush you
with the girlfriend tag in public.

223
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,800
You have had the talk
with Amit, right?

224
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,680
No.

225
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,800
I thought I'll go with the flow.

226
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,640
Like you and Warsi.

227
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,240
Warsi and I had had the
talk right at the start.

228
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,360
We were clear
right from the beginning...

229
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,640
that it's a casual thing.
No strings attached.

230
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,600
Man!

231
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,080
I thought you have to have "the talk"
when you want commitment.

232
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,120
We've only just hooked up.

233
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,400
I just assumed we weren't exclusive.

234
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,560
Not that I want to
sleep with other people.

235
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,400
Managing one is a nightmare!

236
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,080
Look Sids, imagine the reverse.

237
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,200
If Amit told you that
you both are not exclusive...

238
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,640
then how would you feel?

239
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,160
I'd still not care.

240
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,400
Besides the skanky STD part.

241
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,800
Guys!

242
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,800
I've only just become my own person.

243
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,280
How can I become someone's
girlfriend so soon?

244
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,560
Now, go explain this to Amit
with the same clarity.

245
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,760
Anj?

246
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,520
Anj.

247
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,280
You can go if you want.

248
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,200
No. Are you crazy?

249
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,720
Anj, Miss VeeVee is crying.

250
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,880
Please go!

251
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:01,680
-Take our blessings before you leave
-Okay, bye.

252
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,640
Get out of here

253
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,240
Yeah, Mangs!
Go for it!

254
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,960
I wonder if she's had "the talk" yet.

255
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,000
Probably.

256
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,960
I bet she even has a sex schedule
'cause she's so organized.

257
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,240
-Stop it, Mangs.
-Dude, I love Anj...

258
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,080
but you know it's true!
Just imagine the whole thing.

259
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,160
Okay, I'll see you guys.

260
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,320
Bye.

261
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,160
Sids, drop me home?

262
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,480
Are you serious?

263
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,680
Mangs...

264
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,840
How many times a day
do you stalk Mihir's profile?

265
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,000
Be honest.

266
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,400
-Once or twice.
-Be honest.

267
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,280
Once in a while.
Give it back!

268
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,000
Come.
You want me to drop you?

269
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,800
Oh! Such a good friend.

270
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,560
My friends were so fed up,
they told me to get out!

271
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,640
-And...
-Are you serious?

272
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,160
-Well, well, well!
-Oh!

273
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,200
Hi, guys!

274
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,800
What a pleasant surprise!

275
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,880
Ya!

276
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,440
Hi. Shashank Bose.
Anjana and I work together.

277
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,320
-Oh!
-Yes.

278
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,720
The new boss at the new firm.

279
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,360
Hardly. Anjana is a senior partner.
She's her own boss.

280
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,160
Don't I know that!

281
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,160
I'm Varun, by the way.
Anjana's ex-husband.

282
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,600
Ya.

283
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,920
-And this is Kavya, my wife.
-Hi.

284
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,880
-Hi.
-Hi.

285
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,800
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you, too.

286
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,920
And our little bun in the oven.

287
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,920
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

288
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,480
Are you here for work?

289
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,160
Ya, we had a client meeting.

290
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,160
A long boring one at that.

291
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,200
Such misers. They didn't even
offer us a cup of coffee.

292
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,760
-I know.
-We're starving and famished.

293
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,320
Thought we'd grab a bite at the
Italian restaurant downstairs.

294
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,080
Really?
That's where we're going.

295
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,720
Ya. Date night.

296
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,360
Wow.

297
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,000
Why don't you come with us?

298
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,040
No, no Kavya. We don't want to
intrude on your date night.

299
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,960
Just come.
It'll be fun. C'mon.

300
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,680
C'mon. Don't make a fuss.
Let's go.

301
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,320
-Okay.
-Let's do it.

302
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,280
Let's do it.

303
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,680
I really need to pee.

304
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,200
Is the ravioli nice?

305
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,400
In Anjana speak...

306
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,400
means the ravioli is a disaster.

307
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,400
The table napkin is way tastier.

308
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,400
Believe me, I've been working
with this one for a while.

309
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,040
And I can tell you I'm well-versed
with Anjana speak.

310
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,200
When she says "uh-huh", it means
she completely disagrees with you.

311
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,240
But she will not waste her time
and agree with you.

312
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,760
She'll say her nondescript "uh-huh",
and forget about it.

313
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,200
She does this all the time.

314
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,240
Does she still do that passive aggressive
stare at meetings?

315
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:25,320
When she wants to
abuse someone but she can't.

316
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,960
So, she just bites her lower lip.

317
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,920
"Uh-huh."

318
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,920
Oh, my God.
She's doing it right now!

319
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,600
She is!

320
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,640
Are you abusing me or Shashank?

321
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,240
Enough with the wise cracks. Ya?

322
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,920
-Another round?
-Sure. Why not?

323
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,680
Can we get another round, please?

324
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,080
-No, no, no.
-How's this?

325
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,960
Wasn't Shashank married to that
West Comm CEO, Sushmita Sengupta?

326
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,240
I did some advertising work
for them with Dad.

327
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,000
I didn't know that Shashank and
Sushmita had separated.

328
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,440
They haven't.

329
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,960
Are they still together?

330
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,920
It's an open marriage.

331
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,520
Wow!

332
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,000
Kavya...

333
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,320
There's...

334
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,080
nothing between us.
It's just...

335
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,040
sex.

336
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,800
Hey...

337
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,680
You don't need to explain yourself to me.
Who am I to judge anyway?

338
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,760
It's just...

339
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,040
And don't worry.

340
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,720
I won't tell anyone.
Not even Varun.

341
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,560
He'll never know.

342
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,760
You're hiding it pretty well.

343
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,320
Just...

344
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,240
be smart about it.

345
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,760
No man's worth the drama.

346
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,960
Umang...

347
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,960
You haven't given me
your guest list yet.

348
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,880
I did.

349
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,200
But that just has your friends.

350
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,560
I need your family list also.

351
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,040
You haven't told them, have you?

352
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,800
-Umang?
-Mummy?

353
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,320
Hi.

354
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,280
-How are you?
-Did you want something?

355
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,320
No. I wanted to tell you something.

356
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,800
I'm getting married...
to Samara.

357
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:10,520
I wanted to invite you,
Papa, Pinky and Vikram.

358
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,800
We're getting married in Udaipur and...

359
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,200
don't worry. We'll take care of
your travel and stay.

360
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,000
Mummy?

361
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,480
You're an aunt now.

362
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,320
Pinky delivered her baby last week.

363
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,320
No one told me.

364
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,560
We will not be coming.

365
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,080
We need to be here with
the baby and Pinky.

366
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,800
How is she?

367
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,520
Beautiful.

368
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,960
Just like her mother.

369
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,080
I was talking about Pinky.

370
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,520
Pinky?
I haven't seen her this happy.

371
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,480
Simrat is crying.

372
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,080
I have to go.

373
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,560
Bye.

374
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,440
Dinner's ready?
What's on the menu?

375
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,920
I'll get that.

376
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,920
-Hi.
-Hi.

377
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,640
No text? No calls?

378
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,800
You stopped liking my posts.

379
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,680
No, I was going...
I...

380
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,520
Can we talk straight, please?

381
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,280
-Tell me.
-Amit!

382
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,800
Hi, Uncle.

383
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,720
We were about to have dinner. Come.

384
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,000
No, no Papa.
He was just leaving.

385
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,320
Sure, Uncle.
I would love to.

386
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,520
Come, come. Join us.

387
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,760
What is purple and 5000 miles long?

388
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,640
Oh God!

389
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,720
I don't know.

390
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,280
The Grape Wall of China!

391
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,760
Uncle, that is genius.
Honestly.

392
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,800
Papa, you've been telling us the same
stupid internet joke since I was a kid.

393
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,080
It's not even funny.

394
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,560
Internet joke?

395
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,680
Amit, do you want to hear
something really funny?

396
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,560
Yes.

397
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,040
When Siddhi was a kid,
she used to constantly stare...

398
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,440
at the dish antenna on the terrace.

399
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,320
She wanted to see her
favorite cartoon characters

400
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,560
walk into the television and onto screen!

401
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,440
Wait. You think that's funny?

402
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,000
Siddhi used to bury chocolates
in all my house plants.

403
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:41,880
Why?

404
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,760
Because she wanted
to grow chocolate trees!

405
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,920
She truly is one in a million!

406
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,720
This dinner is officially over.

407
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,440
Be a sport. C'mon!

408
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,320
-Excuse me.
-It's okay.

409
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,360
I'll be right back.

410
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,000
What is going on, Hormonal?
You've been upset since that day.

411
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,400
Yes, because in front of all those people,
you suddenly...

412
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,680
Suddenly what?
I called you my girlfriend.

413
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,160
-Is that a crime?
-Yes, Amit!

414
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,120
I was actually under a spotlight!

415
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,200
So what?

416
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,440
What really is your problem?

417
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,160
-I don't like labels!
-Yeah, clearly!

418
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,200
Amit, a girlfriend is a
girl who's a friend.

419
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,280
Therefore, a girl who's a friend
is also a girlfriend.

420
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,360
Siddhi, are we in school?

421
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,960
Next, we'll be celebrating rose day!

422
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,200
What I feel for you,
I don't feel for anyone else!

423
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,960
You mean, you don't have feelings
for your other female friends?

424
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:33,560
No! My heart doesn't explode for them!

425
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,320
Bad eating habits can cause that as well!

426
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,960
Maybe it's trapped gas
or a blocked artery.

427
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,440
Siddhi, do you even
want to be my girlfriend?

428
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,680
I really like hooking up with you.

429
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,720
You make me laugh but...

430
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,760
I don't want to be anybody's
girlfriend right now.

431
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,680
-Fuck you.
-What?

432
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,120
You're a user.

433
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,200
You're just being nasty right now.

434
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,800
We are over, Hormonal.

435
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,160
-Just like that?
-Ya. Just like that.

436
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,400
Mangs, Amit broke up with me.

437
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,800
No, I'm not feeling anything.

438
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,160
No pain, no regret. No drama.

439
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,280
Sorry, shit. Why am I laughing?

440
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,400
Listen, I'm feeling very guilty.
Why am I not feeling anything...

441
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,760
I'll call you back.

442
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,040
Amit, listen to this one.

443
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,320
What did the cockroach tell
the caterpillar?

444
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,440
What happened?

445
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,880
He had to leave, Papa.
Bad tummy.

446
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,800
Tell him to have carom seed water.
He'll be fine.

447
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,440
I will. Next time.

448
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,080
Take these bags to the car.

449
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,960
Remember to pack your heels.

450
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,320
I don't want you to be wearing keds
at our wedding.

451
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,960
Have a great time at the bachelorette.

452
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,040
Don't do anything that I wouldn't do.

453
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,040
-And I'm going to see you in three days.
-Alright.

454
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,880
-I love you.
-I love you so much.

455
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,760
Message me, okay?

456
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,640
I will. I will.

457
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,640
I've got to run now, okay?

458
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,560
Bye.

459
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:10,120
-You look so cute, Umang!
-Best dressed!

460
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,840
I want you guys to know...

461
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,640
that I hate you.

462
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,280
I hate all of you.

463
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,640
Doesn't matter.
We'll live with it.

464
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,720
This dress is attacking me!

465
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,120
Physically.

466
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,920
Emotionally.

467
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,280
Spiritually.

468
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:31,200
We found you the ugliest
dress possible, Umang.

469
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,080
It's shit.

470
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,760
Mangs, this is the
best you've ever looked.

471
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,480
Your bachelorette tasks tonight.

472
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,880
You have to do it all.
Success gets you one shot.

473
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,080
And failure gets you two shots.

474
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,920
"Dance like Sridevi.

475
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,080
Fake an orgasm like Sally."

476
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,320
Who is Sally?

477
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,800
She met Harry?

478
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,080
I thought he met Sejal.

479
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,640
-Never mind.
-I am so looking forward to this.

480
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,920
You're a traitor.
I thought you were my bro.

481
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,840
Not tonight.

482
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,920
Not tonight!

483
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,920
Go, Mangs!

484
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,400
Some balloons?

485
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,160
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

486
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,320
-Can I have a fry?
-Sure.

487
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,000
-Do you know her?
-I don't know her.

488
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,360
-Who's she?
-Oh, my God.

489
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,440
How embarrassing is this.
What's going on?

490
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,880
Oh, my God. It's hot!

491
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,320
-Dude!
-What the hell!

492
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,480
What's wrong? Are you okay?

493
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,160
-Are you okay?
-Ya!

494
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,320
What?

495
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,240
It's alright.

496
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:03,960
Jeh!

497
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,120
Shot!

498
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,160
Shot! Shot! Shot!

499
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,320
Go, Mangs!

500
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,200
Go, Mangs!

501
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,280
Mangs, Mangs, Mangs!

502
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,560
Go, baby!

503
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,280
-How are you?
-What the fuck!

504
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,920
-Who is she?
-If you sprinkle when you tinkle,

505
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,480
be a neaty and wipe the seaty.
Okay?

506
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,040
Jeh?

507
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,600
C'mon, Mangs!
C'mon!

508
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,280
Yes!

509
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,480
Go, Mangs!

510
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,560
Go, Mangs!

511
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,800
Yeah, baby!

512
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,120
My head is spinning.

513
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,120
No, but the last one is truth.
No dare. C'mon, c'mon.

514
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,920
I am so drunk right now.

515
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,720
-Tell me your biggest fear.
-I'm going to sweat tequila tomorrow.

516
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,080
That's perfect!
Truth serum.

517
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,160
C'mon. Let's go!

518
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,720
No! It's so unfair.

519
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,400
You guys go first.
Then, I'll go.

520
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,480
-Okay fine, I'll go first.
-Okay.

521
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:51,280
So, my biggest fear is that
one day Arya will hate me...

522
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:57,280
and start living with Varun
because... he indulges her.

523
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,760
He's fun...

524
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,480
and I am a disciplinarian.

525
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,120
My biggest fear is that...

526
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,240
no matter what I accomplish,

527
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,360
I will only be judged by my body.

528
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,160
You are a Goddess, baby.

529
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,640
Great. Bring up Mihir,
why don't you?

530
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,160
Mihir?

531
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,760
Only you remember that
he used to call you a Goddess.

532
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,920
Because only you're stalking him!

533
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,800
What!

534
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,160
Shit, are you stalking him?

535
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,720
Not true.
Stop talking rubbish!

536
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,040
Dee, your turn.

537
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:36,240
I fear that I may not know writing.

538
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,600
I'm a fraud who's meant to fail.

539
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,720
Umang, your turn now.
Tell us.

540
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,600
No, listen!

541
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,480
Come.

542
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,520
I just...

543
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,200
I love Samara so much.

544
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,280
I feel I will lose myself.

545
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,680
You're Umang Singh.

546
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,760
You've fought hard for your identity.

547
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,640
Nobody can change Umang.

548
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,040
-Wow!
-Not even Umang.

549
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,440
Wow! Well said.

550
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:17,400
No one can ever change you, Umang.

551
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,080
What happened?

552
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,720
Now, it's a party!

553
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,600
Umang.

554
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,800
-Wait, I am coming, Mangs.
-Oh God.

555
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,840
Throw it all up.

556
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,280
Drink some water.
You'll feel better.

557
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,800
-I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.
-No, you're not going to die.

558
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,880
-I'm going to die.
You're getting married.

559
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,280
I just wish I could hide
away in your arms.

560
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,080
As I used to when I was a child.

561
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:44,440
There are too many things
I have no control over anymore, Mom.

562
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,120
I'm scared.

563
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,280
Damini, stop worrying.
I will be there with you.

564
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,240
For as many months as you need me.

565
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,920
Three months, six months.
I'm going to help you with the baby.

566
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,680
It's okay to be scared of the unknown.

567
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,200
You are not alone.

568
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,320
We are right here.

569
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,280
Thank you.

570
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,000
I'm going to call you every single day.

571
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,640
-Sleep well, okay?
-We love you a lot.

572
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,920
-Eat properly.
-Don't get into any trouble.

573
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Take care.

574
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,720
You're pregnant?

575
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,920
That's why you've been avoiding
alcohol and Chinese food.

576
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,080
Oh, my God! And I thought you
were trying to break it off with me!

577
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,440
Oh man, I'm so relieved!
I'm so slow.

578
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:50,040
You had an entire conversation on babies
with me and I still didn't get it!

579
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,960
A baby.

580
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,880
I'm going to be a dad.

581
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,960
Oh, my God. You and me.
We're going to be parents.

582
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,560
You and me are going to be a parents!

583
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,600
Wait a minute.

584
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,880
We will have to take classes
before the baby arrives.

585
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,880
The crib.
And the car seat.

586
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,440
Oh, my God.
I have to buy a new car!

587
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,400
I'm delirious!
We're going to have baby!

588
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,280
We're going to be parents!

589
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,560
We're going to be parents.

590
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,920
This is...this is the
happiest day of my life!

591
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,440
It's... it's not yours.

592
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,880
What?

593
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,240
Of course. Right.

594
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,040
This is the happiest day of... our lives!

595
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,320
I'm sorry.
That was self centered.

596
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,520
The baby...

597
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,240
is not yours.

598
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,800
What?

599
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,840
It's Aamir's.

600
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,400
I'm eight weeks pregnant.

601
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,680
You and I got together six weeks ago.

602
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,520
Aamir and I were together before that.
It was just a casual thing.

603
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,720
We were casually hooking up.

604
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,920
But from the time we got back together,
I haven't even seen him, Jeh.

605
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,640
I met him just once to
tell him about the pregnancy.

606
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,080
Look, I know I should have
told you about Warsi but...

607
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,280
But there was nothing there.
It was just a casual thing that's why...

608
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,720
I know. I'm sorry.
I should have thought this through.

609
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,040
I'm sorry, baby.

610
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,240
I'm not going back to Warsi
if that's what you're thinking.

611
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,120
Damini.

612
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,040
Jeh, I want to be with you.
I love you, baby.

613
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,040
Please.

614
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,880
-He's the father of the baby.
-Damini. Damini.

615
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,720
He has the right to know.

616
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,840
Listen, I don't want anything from Warsi.
I never wanted anything from him.

617
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,160
Jeh, we will just co-parent. That's all.
It's clear over there.

618
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,240
Jeh, say something.

619
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,920
It's the same story, Damini.

620
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,680
Again and again.

621
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,880
Jeh, please. No.

622
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,840
Damini!

623
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,760
Is this a joke for you?

624
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,840
Breaking my trust every single time!

625
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,720
No, Jeh. Please.

626
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,640
No! No!
Damini.

627
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,080
Not this time.

628
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,680
You fool me once.

629
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,240
Shame on you.

630
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,160
You fool me twice.

631
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,160
Shame on me.

632
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,360
Jeh, I didn't lie to you.
Jeh, I didn't fool you!

633
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,920
Damini, you need to leave.
You need to leave.

634
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,920
You need to leave.
I need to open my bar.

635
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,480
-Jeh, please. Just sit down...
-Damini.

636
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,000
-and have this conversation. Please.
-Just go away.

637
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,920
-Please, Jeh. Please!
-Damini. Leave.

638
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,160
Damini, get out!
