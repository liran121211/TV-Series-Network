1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,680
Is your heart pounding?

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,880
Have you lost your appetite?
Is your mind not in anything?

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,120
Not even in social media?

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,560
Be careful.

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,160
Love is in the air.
You just might catch it!

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,000
So basically, you're #LittleMcSlutty!

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,360
You know like those dogs who
just hump and move on?

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,680
That's how you are.

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,800
What the hell, Mangs!

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,840
You slept with Mihir
eight hours after meeting him.

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,720
Eight hours!

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,800
Not eight hours.
Eighteen years.

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,000
Since childhood, we've been spending...

14
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,560
every summer vacation together.

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,960
But after turning eighteen, it took
you just eight hours.

16
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,000
And what about our Turkish delight?

17
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,760
What was that?
Ten hours?

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,680
He wore a bow tie for me.

19
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,360
-Just a bow tie.
-Where?

20
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,200
And, what about Amit?

21
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,560
How long has it been?

22
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,440
Three weeks?

23
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,840
We haven't slept together.

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,880
Yet.

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,760
There's a little improvement.

26
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,640
You didn't jump straight to wham-bam
thank-you-Sam this time!

27
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
But seriously...

28
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,320
have you guys even been out
for coffee yet?

29
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,640
Seriously, Siddhi.

30
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,400
Apart from your comedy set,

31
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,560
have you had a real
conversation with him?

32
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,880
Obviously not! Even if he opens his mouth

33
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,320
he will be doomed!

34
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,760
Because she will dump him!

35
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,080
#LittleMcSlutty

36
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,880
Sids, from being
the Goddess of Virginity...

37
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,040
to the Goddess of Lust
in less than a year!

38
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,640
I don't know whether to be proud of her
or ashamed of her.

39
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,640
Come on, guys.

40
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,800
She's just making up for
all the lost time.

41
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,920
You're right.

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,640
-Are you done?
-No.

43
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,200
There's more!

44
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,200
-Varun's here.
-Wait. Why?

45
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,440
Remember the night that we bonded?

46
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,800
Since then he's been making plans.

47
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,080
So, I told him I'd be here.

48
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,920
I didn't know he'd actually land up.

49
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,760
Hello, ladies!

50
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,080
So...

51
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,960
-this is the infamous girls' night.
-Oh, my God!

52
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,840
Exactly. Girls' night!

53
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,200
Mangs, chill.

54
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,440
It was because of me
that you guys met Anj.

55
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,800
Think about it.

56
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,840
If I hadn't been such
a douche that day,

57
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,520
she would've never landed up here.

58
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,040
That was my drink.

59
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,760
Sharing is caring, Dee.

60
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,880
Anj!

61
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,120
Fucking gorgeous red lipstick!

62
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,320
Right?

63
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,280
Alright. Shots!

64
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,880
Your bill.

65
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,760
Salty!

66
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,160
-I am sorry about that.
-No, it's fine. We'll pay for it.

67
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,120
It's fine.

68
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,800
I'll put it on your tab.

69
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,360
What's the story there?

70
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,360
That's none of your business.

71
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,800
That explains a lot.

72
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,600
Jeh and I... we have a past.
That's it.

73
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,880
That's not just it.

74
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,720
It's a bus.

75
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,080
A double-decker bus!

76
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,040
Allow me.

77
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,080
Dee fucked Jeh while she was
fucking another guy

78
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,720
who we all call Hot Doc.

79
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,640
And Jeh saw her kissing him.

80
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,040
And then Jeh got back with his ex...

81
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,720
who he had found cheating
on him long ago.

82
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,720
How does his cheating
outshine Dee's cheating?

83
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,640
Thanks, guys.

84
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,920
For summarizing my pain into
a few short sentences.

85
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,520
Anytime.

86
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,960
On that note.

87
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,960
Shots!

88
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,040
Varun.

89
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,000
You've had enough.
Please just go home now.

90
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,800
I don't want to go home.

91
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,680
Why?

92
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,800
Kavs!

93
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,800
She's damn hormonal!
She's driving me up the wall.

94
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,000
I mean she has mood swings and...

95
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,200
I get it. But I just need to be me.

96
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,000
And Kavya?

97
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,160
What about her?

98
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,360
She will never get
to be herself again.

99
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,680
She doesn't want to have sex.

100
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,320
Morning sickness, back pain.
She doesn't stop complaining.

101
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,120
Okay, so? So what?

102
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,640
Just masturbate.

103
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,800
Listen, zero sympathy for you.

104
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,800
You have no idea of the changes
she is going through.

105
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,920
-You were way cooler when--
-No, I wasn't.

106
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,000
I wasn't.

107
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,760
Distance just makes
your heart grow fonder.

108
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,200
Varun, please stop being an asshole.

109
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,320
I'm not being an asshole!
I'm just venting.

110
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,880
I'm venting to my friend, my...

111
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,480
my first love, the mother
of my child.

112
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,800
If not with you, who else will I
share this with?

113
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,360
Share it with your therapist?

114
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,000
What a point, Mangs!

115
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,440
Dr. Bartender, five more shots please.

116
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,080
To Anj and Dee and Sids
and Mangs and...

117
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,000
Is "Vaar" better or "Roon"?

118
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,480
Run is more like it.

119
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,640
Run before I lose my shit!

120
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,040
No!

121
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,760
That's someone else's drink!

122
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,800
All drinks are equal in the
eyes of the Lord.

123
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,880
Oh, God!

124
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,200
Varun! Are you okay?
Oh, my God!

125
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,840
You are my favorites.
My total favorites.

126
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,400
-Varun, careful!
-You make me happy every time.

127
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,080
We are our favorites but
you are not our favorite!

128
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,400
I'm getting off first.
Don't worry, guys.

129
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,840
-Bye.
-Bye.

130
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,320
Get out of here, asshole!

131
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,600
-Bye.
-Bye.

132
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,760
-Bye, Sids.
-Bye.

133
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,000
What are you looking at?

134
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,720
Mihir just liked my pic.

135
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,080
He's still alive?

136
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,960
Call the driver, let's go!

137
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,800
Sids!

138
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
-Go safe, okay? Goodnight.
-Okay, bye.

139
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,880
Goodnight.

140
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,840
Varun. Taxi!

141
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,080
Shit! Taxi!

142
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,920
Taxi!

143
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,080
He's gone.

144
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,400
-Why did you get off?
-Taxi!

145
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,880
I'm booking another cab for you.

146
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,480
No, I don't want another cab.
I want another drink.

147
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,760
Haven't you had enough
for tonight, Varun?

148
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,960
Darling, when it comes to you,
it's never enough.

149
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,200
-Come on!
-Varun, no! Please!

150
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,280
One for me! Please!

151
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,040
Did you throw up?

152
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,280
Back to your college days.

153
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,600
Oh, yeah.

154
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,720
Arya's sleeping?

155
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,080
Yes.

156
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,800
-Did Radha leave?
-Yes, she left.

157
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,720
Don't worry. She didn't see you.

158
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,080
Or else, she would've stayed back
to save me from you.

159
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,080
When did you turn so beautiful?

160
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,240
What do you mean?

161
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,680
I mean... you look different.

162
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,880
You're a woman now.

163
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,720
Then, you were just a girl.

164
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,080
And you were just a boy...

165
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,560
who had no concept of bathing or
using deodorant.

166
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,560
Not much has changed.

167
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,920
I remember the first time I saw you.

168
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,480
It was at the NLS college canteen.

169
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,640
You were wearing this...

170
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,720
pink long shirt, skinny jeans...

171
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,680
and you had a cheap-ass phone.

172
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,800
Not bad.

173
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,200
It wasn't pink though.
It was fuchsia.

174
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,000
Fuchsia, Luchsia...
Whatever!

175
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,160
It worked for me.

176
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,320
I remember, I had just joined
Facebook and you stalked me.

177
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,200
Yes, your relationship status was...

178
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,640
"it's complicated"!

179
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,600
I guess I was just trying to sound deep.

180
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,200
Well, you deeply fucked up my brain.

181
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,680
Romance is no fun without
the fuck-ups.

182
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,600
You know, I keep thinking
about the other night.

183
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,000
We were so comfortable with each other.

184
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,160
Kavya and I don't have that.

185
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,160
We...

186
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,880
were together for ten years, Varun.

187
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,200
We literally grew up together.

188
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,440
But we'll never grow old together.

189
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,520
Fuck!
Stop!

190
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,080
What?

191
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,880
It wasn't that bad.

192
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,880
It wasn't bad.
It was wrong, Varun!

193
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,080
Just forget about this. This...

194
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,520
Listen. Look at me.

195
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,760
This never happened.

196
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,600
It never happened.
We are divorced!

197
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,880
And...

198
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,320
You and Kavya are expecting a baby!

199
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,640
What the fuck is going on!

200
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,000
It shouldn't have happened. Fuck!

201
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,360
And you... taste of vomit.

202
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,600
It's Kavya!

203
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,880
Are you going to answer it?

204
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,240
Are you fucking crazy?

205
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,760
You have to answer it, Anj!

206
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,280
I don't want it!

207
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,760
-Okay, fine. I'll answer it.
-No! No!

208
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,640
Hello.

209
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,280
She hung up.

210
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,600
Yeah, disconnected.

211
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,480
Shit!

212
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,880
-Fuck!
-It's her again...

213
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,760
She doesn't know anything.

214
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,760
Don't confess anything and
fuck it up.

215
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,160
Just pick it up.

216
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,960
Hi, Kavya.

217
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,040
No, I'm awake.

218
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,600
Yes, he's here. He's sleeping.

219
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,520
On the sofa.

220
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,760
In the living room.
I'm in my bedroom.

221
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,160
No. He was super drunk,
so he just crashed here.

222
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,280
Yes, that's all right.
Okay, bye.

223
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,200
Love you.

224
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,520
Love you?

225
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,000
I was nervous. It just slipped out.

226
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,640
-You know...
-Umang, please.

227
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,640
he's losing his hair on his head.

228
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,400
And they're now growing out
from his ears!

229
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,640
You got out at the right time.

230
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,640
By the way, why did he kiss you?

231
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,040
He's horny because
he's not getting any from Kavya.

232
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,960
You know actually, during my pregnancy,
I was super horny.

233
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,680
Especially the third trimester.

234
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,640
You mean, you went at it like bunnies?

235
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,800
No, we didn't.

236
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,920
He was frightened
that he would hurt the baby.

237
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,920
With his penis?
How big does he think it is?

238
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,920
How big do they all think theirs is?

239
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,280
-Seriously.
-That's true.

240
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,800
Okay, let's move on.

241
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,360
Tell us.

242
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,600
Why did you kiss him back?

243
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,880
I don't know.

244
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,880
It was maybe out of habit or nostalgia.

245
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,640
I just feel so guilty.

246
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,560
Don't.

247
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,040
It's closure.

248
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,280
It gets minus in the balancing
of the relationship equation.

249
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,560
It's fine!

250
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,640
What kind of closure is this?

251
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,600
A puke tasting slobber of a kiss
in the middle of the night.

252
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,000
An apt reflection of my marriage,
I guess.

253
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,240
Anjana, could you pass me the butter?

254
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,720
Of course.

255
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,160
-Thank you.
-You're very welcome.

256
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,480
Could you pass me some fruit?

257
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,520
Thank you.

258
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,600
Hi!

259
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,560
Hello, Aunt Pookie.

260
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,080
Hello, baby.

261
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,760
When are you coming to play with me?

262
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,960
Hello, Arya.
Wait for a few months.

263
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,320
-Okay.
-Come.

264
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,080
-Good morning, party people!
-Hi!

265
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,520
Hi, Kavya.
You are glowing.

266
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,160
Come. Sit.

267
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,480
Come and have breakfast with us.

268
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,280
Radha, bring us another plate.

269
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,320
What do you want?
Do you want some...

270
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,720
There's some scrambled eggs.

271
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,280
Would you like...
There's some oats as well.

272
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,360
-You should try that.
-Okay.

273
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,440
Nutritious breakfast is
so important during pregnancy.

274
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,480
Oh... you know what?
Freshly squeezed orange juice.

275
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,080
-Yes!
-It's the best.

276
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,840
Yeah. Sure.

277
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,040
-There you go.
-Thank you.

278
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,280
Thank you.

279
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,760
You're really sweet, Anjana.

280
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,400
Baby... it's time for your bath.

281
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,200
-Go with Radha.
-No, Mama.

282
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,800
-You have to go.
-Yes.

283
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,600
-Okay, give me a kiss.
-Go. Good girl.

284
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,720
-Bye.
-Wash behind your ears.

285
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,880
So...

286
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,120
Were you drunk last night?

287
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,000
We were at Truck Bar.
So, we drank.

288
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,320
-We drank a lot. At least I did.
-Yes.

289
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,360
And the girls were also there.

290
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,600
Yes! Siddhi, Umang... so cool.

291
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,480
Damini was there as well

292
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,160
And you know who Umang is seeing?

293
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,200
My number one Bollywood crush.

294
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,720
-Samara Kapoor?
-Samara Kapoor!

295
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,560
Wow! Isn't she number one on
your celeb cheat list?

296
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,240
Celeb cheat list?

297
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,320
It means, celebrities you can do and
it's not considered cheating.

298
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,600
It's because the chances of that
happening are as low as...

299
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,800
snowfall in Mumbai.

300
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,600
Mumbai is not going to have snow.

301
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,240
Mine is Ryan Gosling.

302
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,520
Excellent choice.

303
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,640
Not that I'm okay with Varun
cheating on me.

304
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,800
I mean, I'd kill him.

305
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,840
Absolutely.
You should.

306
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,720
I'm gonna go. I'm gonna...
just start the car and be ready.

307
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,920
But I've not finished eating
my breakfast.

308
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,440
You take your time.

309
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,160
I'll just see you downstairs.

310
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,760
Great.

311
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,400
I'm pregnant and
he's acting hormonal.

312
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,160
Is this the first time
you're traveling in a local train?

313
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,680
Unbelievable.

314
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,880
You are so mean!

315
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,520
What are you doing? I am not jumping.

316
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,920
Come in.

317
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,880
So, what do you think?

318
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,840
It's very... hipster-ish?

319
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,120
Listen.

320
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,440
Please turn on the air conditioner.

321
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,520
Let me buy one first.

322
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,800
What do you mean?

323
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,440
Please increase the fan's speed.

324
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,560
The regulator's gone rogue.

325
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,480
-What is this?
-What?

326
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,120
This maid of mine just leaves
things everywhere!

327
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,840
Sorry for that.
Come here.

328
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,720
-Stop.
-What happened?

329
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,960
What's the rush?

330
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,680
Is it because of the house?

331
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,560
You didn't like the house, right?

332
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,080
No, it's just... it's because I'm...

333
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,680
I'm not a bitch.

334
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,360
Yes. Of course not.

335
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,640
No, I mean... I just don't
want to rush things.

336
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,400
I want our first time to be special.

337
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,680
You're right. Of course.

338
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,440
We should take this slow.

339
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,520
Slow is the new fast.

340
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,840
Oh! Sorry!

341
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,720
Siddhi? I'm Shayan.

342
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,040
Amit's roommate.

343
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,160
Nice to meet you.

344
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,080
Fuck you very much!

345
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,880
Sir, please turn the car around.

346
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,760
I'll update the location.

347
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,200
Damini?

348
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,880
What happened?
Did you find another puppy?

349
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,560
Shit, I'm so sorry.

350
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,800
Damini, it was a joke.

351
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,480
I miss him so much, Jeh.

352
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,720
Shit... why am I crying?

353
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,800
I'm such a loser.

354
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,480
-Damini, you are not a loser.
-What the fuck is wrong with me?

355
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,440
You've written an entire book.

356
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,480
I can't even type a text
without using auto correct.

357
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,400
Right.

358
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,960
Good for all my spellings and
commas and apostrophes but...

359
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,760
nobody's ever going to
publish my book. Period.

360
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,520
You want to talk about it?

361
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,800
There are many people inside.

362
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,080
Okay, come on. Let's go get some tea.

363
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,880
Come on.

364
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,560
Come on.

365
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,080
Let's go.

366
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,400
Give him a cup of tea.

367
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,400
My father is the one
who makes tea at home.

368
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,440
Cheers.

369
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,640
He makes it with ginger and lemon.

370
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,800
I think that's why I like tea so much.

371
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,200
In a good cup of tea...
with ginger and tea leaves,

372
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,920
it's almost like our feelings
also bubble over.

373
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,040
My father says "A good cup of tea
can fix everything."

374
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,800
Cold, cough, heartbreak...

375
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,280
I don't know if it can fix this also.

376
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,720
I've known you for
four years now, Damini.

377
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,080
You're better than them.

378
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,160
And you're definitely
better than this pitfall.

379
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,880
Thanks, Jeh.

380
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,560
-I don't know but--
-You will fight it out this time as well.

381
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,160
If anyone can do it, it's you Damini.

382
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,960
Remember when you took the puppy in
and dealt with your OCD?

383
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,080
And when you wrote that troll story?

384
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,720
Despite all the pressures
from the board.

385
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,520
And when you returned your award...

386
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,880
and quit the very company
you founded.

387
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,520
It was because you have the guts
to stand for your ideals, Damini.

388
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,640
Damini, you don't need them.

389
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,200
You are all you've ever needed.

390
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,800
So, what should I do?

391
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,480
Shall I publish my own book?

392
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,760
Can you do that?

393
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,080
Yes! Why not?

394
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,000
Publish it yourself.

395
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,800
You're right.

396
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,480
You're right.
I don't need them.

397
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,720
I can fucking self-publish, Jeh!

398
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,920
Self-publishing will require
a lot of work.

399
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,760
I'll have to be my own editor and
my own distributor.

400
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,760
And...

401
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,320
it will require a lot of money but...

402
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,000
I can encash my shares and
break my fixed deposits.

403
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,640
It's possible!

404
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,040
Why didn't I think of it before?

405
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,320
Hold this.

406
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,640
I need to tell Mom and Dad.
I'll need their expertise!

407
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,560
TIFA Awards!

408
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,080
Can you believe it?

409
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,680
For the past ten years, I've either
performed or presented or

410
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,680
won or all three and...

411
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,080
this year nothing!

412
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,080
Not even a peep!

413
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,000
They've just sent me an invite!

414
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,520
Seriously.

415
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,560
Do you want to go?

416
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,280
Why?

417
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,920
So that they can ridicule and
make fun of me? Obviously not!

418
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,720
Sam...

419
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,240
if you go to one of these...

420
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,440
it will give you the courage to
go to the other places.

421
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,320
It says that you can take someone along.
Take your manager with you.

422
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,800
She will protect you.

423
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,480
You're right.

424
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,320
I'm gonna go.

425
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,400
But with you.

426
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,400
No it's... it's time.

427
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,320
It's time for me to go out
into the world. It's...

428
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,080
It's time for me to live my truth.

429
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,800
Sam, don't complicate your life.

430
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,760
I'm simplifying my life.

431
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,400
I want to do this.

432
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,280
If they don't accept me,
then that's their problem.

433
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,800
It's not my problem.

434
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,000
Look...

435
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,520
they accept all of me or
none of me.

436
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,040
-You understand?
-Yes.

437
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,480
Thank you.

438
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,040
Yes! Hens lay boiled eggs!

439
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,520
-How?
-By drinking boiled water!

440
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,640
Guys! Amit is stuck in traffic.

441
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,040
-He's not going to make it!
-What?

442
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,040
Really?

443
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,920
Thank you so much for
such a great start!

444
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,320
That was Vishal from Pune!
Let's give it up for him!

445
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,160
So next up, we have Amit and Siddhi...

446
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,120
from North Mumbai
and South Mumbai!

447
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,840
Siddhi, where's Amit?
Where is he?

448
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,240
He's stuck in traffic. He's coming.
I just spoke to him.

449
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,440
What the fuck!

450
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,280
You guys are highly unprofessional.

451
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,760
Is this some kind of a
joke for you?

452
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,640
I'm never going to bloody book
you ever again. I'm done!

453
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,240
Shit.

454
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,280
If Amit can't make it,
why don't you go?

455
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,440
Should I go to find him?

456
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,120
I mean, get on stage!

457
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,840
Alone? Have you lost it?

458
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,440
-Siddhi, I think it's a great idea.
-Siddhi, just go.

459
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,200
You should just do it.

460
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,720
This is your moment.
You got this. Just go!

461
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,560
-Go, go, go.
-Just go!

462
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,920
-Don't think. Just go. You can do it!
-You've got this man.

463
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,520
-Go!
-Yes. Just...

464
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,040
calm yourself down.

465
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,200
Okay, fuck it. I'm going to do this.

466
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,520
Excuse me! I'm coming.

467
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,560
And here comes Siddhi!
Let's give it up for her!

468
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,440
SoBo! SoBo! SoBo!

469
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,680
Big hi, everyone!

470
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,040
Sorry! No NoBo tonight. Just SoBo.

471
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,000
NoBo is stuck in traffic.

472
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,600
That was my opening joke.

473
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,400
about Mumbai traffic.

474
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,440
Sorry. Sweaty palms.

475
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,160
Actually, I don't sweat so much.

476
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,600
I mean, I sweat in the summers
but I'm not a sweater.

477
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,360
I mean, not the cardigan type...

478
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,080
Basically, I'm not a sweaty person.

479
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,200
We get that you're not sweaty.
But, are you funny?

480
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,560
Yes.

481
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,640
My friends say that I'm
the funniest person they know.

482
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,680
-Yes, we do!
-Yeah! That's right!

483
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,040
So basically, I'm sweltering
hot without the sweat.

484
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,240
Anyway...

485
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,960
I'm going to tell you a funny
story about another bodily fluid.

486
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,480
So recently, I walked in on
my friend's roommate masturbating.

487
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,080
Like he had his...

488
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,720
He had his thing in his hand
out there in the open.

489
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,920
And he wanted me to shake it!

490
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,120
His hand. Not his thing.

491
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,480
It's because that would be a
sexual offense. Not a joke.

492
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,960
You're boring the hell out of us!
Please get rid of her.

493
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,440
You! Maybe I should get rid of
you for good!

494
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,840
-Excuse me.
-What?

495
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,720
-I have paid a cover charge for tonight.
-So?

496
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,480
So, I think I have
the right to criticize.

497
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,320
Your cover charge covers
two complimentary beers.

498
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,160
-Drink and just chill.
-True.

499
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,440
Shitty bar with shit drinks.

500
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,440
And shit comedy.

501
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,480
Excuse me?

502
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,200
-It's the best bar in the world, okay!
-Damn right.

503
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,400
Sids...

504
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,000
Sids!

505
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,840
Nobody is going to offer us
another show now.

506
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,440
It's fine, Hormonal.
Don't worry about it.

507
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,120
There are plenty clubs in Mumbai.

508
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,120
Besides, it was my fault today.

509
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,400
I turned up late.
So, it's okay.

510
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,880
How do you make it look so easy?

511
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,000
You know, I've realized today
how tough this really is!

512
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,680
I plan the theme and flow
ahead of every show.

513
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,800
And you...

514
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,720
You come across as
somebody who just...

515
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,280
goes with her instincts. Right?

516
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,040
I mean it's raw, it's honest, it's...

517
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,400
Just not stage worthy.

518
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,200
Of course, it's stage-worthy.

519
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,520
This is what people want!
Raw, honest fucking emotions!

520
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:24,520
But you need practice
to land your jokes right.

521
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,560
Although all my
jokes were being booed...

522
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,680
but when I was up on that stage...

523
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,360
I was feeling so...

524
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,160
Like you're alive, right?

525
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,600
-Yes!
-Yes!

526
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,360
Sorry.

527
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,920
You are now officially
a stage addict!

528
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,480
The audience wants insight.
People love fucking drama, right?

529
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,200
So, take them high with your story.

530
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,600
Leave them hanging over
there for a bit.

531
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,640
And when they least expect it...

532
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,800
Bam! Punch line.

533
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,040
Why are you so stressed?

534
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,360
I'm here.
I'm here to help you out.

535
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,000
And anyway, I think you should
go solo now.

536
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,720
You're stealing my spotlight.
What are you up to, Sids?

537
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,680
What's wrong with you?

538
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,000
What's going on here?
Get a move on.

539
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,240
-Sorry, Sir!
-Move along!

540
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,240
-Get moving!
-We're going.

541
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,000
-Come on!
-We weren't doing anything.

542
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,720
-You don't even know this language!
-Leave. Get going!

543
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,720
Ready?

544
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,640
Sorry.

545
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,880
-Mom!
-My sweetheart!

546
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,120
-How are you, baby?
-Very good. Thank you for coming.

547
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,760
-You're welcome, baby.
-Come.

548
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,800
Welcome home!

549
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,760
Traffic in Mumbai is completely crazy.

550
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,880
What to do?

551
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,400
The listing's live on Amazon.

552
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,640
That's nice. Excellent!

553
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,440
Judge Damodar?

554
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,040
I can't keep such a controversial
book in my store.

555
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,280
But ma'am, this is an important...

556
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,080
Sir, please.
Keep a few copies at least!

557
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,920
Ma'am, we cannot sell this book.
Please leave me alone.

558
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,640
-Sir, please. Just read it once!
-No, ma'am.

559
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,920
I'm sorry, Miss Roy.

560
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,760
-Please, ma'am.
-I'm sorry.

561
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,880
I heard you couldn't convince the
big guys to publish it.

562
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,360
Too bad.

563
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,920
For them.

564
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,600
You mean...

565
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,720
You'll keep it?

566
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,960
Fifty copies.

567
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,640
Readers will lap it up.

568
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,880
Wait and watch.

569
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,520
Jeh!

570
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,720
Jeh! You there?

571
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,680
Damini?

572
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,400
All okay?

573
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,600
ZigZag Bookstore kept fifty copies.

574
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,240
Wow! Congratulations.

575
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,440
This wouldn't have been
possible without you, Jeh.

576
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,600
You're giving me way too much credit.

577
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,160
No! You gave me the belief and the
confidence!

578
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,760
-It was all you, Damini.
-No, it was you, Jeh!

579
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,480
-Thank you!
-I'm so happy for you!

580
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,760
-I'm so happy!
-I'm so happy for you!

581
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,760
Now what?

582
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,520
I broke up with Myra.

583
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,360
I came clean with her, Damini.

584
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,720
I told her how I feel about you.

585
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,160
I did the same thing
that I left her for.

586
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,560
I told her I didn't want to be
unfair to her or myself.

587
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,760
Guys?

588
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,160
Dee, ever heard of Deja Chu?

589
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,400
A fuck up that's happened before.

590
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,120
It's the same situation.

591
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,480
The same triangle.

592
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,760
The same two men.

593
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,040
The same problem.

594
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,600
I won't tell him.

595
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,680
You mean, won't you tell Warsi about Jeh?

596
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,680
No.

597
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,080
Tell Jeh about Warsi.

598
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,320
Wow.

599
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,840
Besides, there's nothing to tell.

600
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,240
We're just friends...
with benefits.

601
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,560
Which we won't be soon.
Soon after I break it off with Warsi.

602
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,080
If there's nothing there,
then why the need to break it off?

603
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,920
So what should I do?
Should I stop taking his calls?

604
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,080
Yes!

605
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:00,960
Yeah!

606
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,640
I have to be polite, Mangs!

607
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,160
You know when...

608
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,840
the municipality cuts the
water supply in a building,

609
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,720
don't they first send
a circular to the residents?

610
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,680
So that you're not stuck mid-shower
with shampoo in your hair.

611
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,720
But eventually, the water gets
restored, right?

612
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,360
Are you planning on restoring
your supply to Warsi?

613
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,840
And is Jeh the plumber who's going to
repair your breakdown?

614
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,480
So confused!

615
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,400
What about Myra?

616
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,800
Myra is that water tanker...

617
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,040
that Jeh no longer needs!

618
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,760
How mean!

619
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,280
-Don't be sad.
-Don't be sad.

620
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,640
Me, too.

621
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,760
Go for it!

622
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,520
So, Polyamory?

623
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,560
Seems to be quite in these days.

624
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,000
I'm sorry?

625
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,720
Damini...

626
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,480
if you want to date Jeh,
I'm fine with it.

627
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,760
I'm not looking for
monogamy or fidelity.

628
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,120
But you are.

629
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,240
And...

630
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,600
he is.

631
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,040
Aamir, I'm...

632
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,240
I'm really sorry, I...

633
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,720
I can't see you anymore.

634
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,800
I need to give Jeh and me
my best shot.

635
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,880
So, should we bother
finishing this meal?

636
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,480
Or should I just call for the bill?

637
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,800
Samara! Samara!
Samara!

638
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,280
Samara!

639
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,680
Samara, Samara!

640
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,800
Samara, look here!
Samara, to your right!

641
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,640
Samara!
Samara, are you gay?

642
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,160
Samara, are you a lesbian?

643
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,760
Are you a lesbian?

644
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,760
Don't worry. Let them just say or
do whatever they want.

645
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,360
I was going to say
the same thing to you!

646
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,920
Samara, is this your girlfriend?

647
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Let's do this.

648
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,080
Aren't you afraid?
Aren't you frightened?

649
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,880
Are you making a statement?

650
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,920
-Are you a lesbian?
-Are you officially out?

651
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,080
Samara, aren't you afraid?

652
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,640
Are you coming out of the closet?

653
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,800
Are you a lesbian?

654
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,080
Yes.

655
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,120
-Is this your girlfriend?
-Are you guys dating?

656
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,160
Yes!

657
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,520
Are you guys in love?

658
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,800
Yes!

659
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,920
-Are you a lesbian?
-Are you coming out of the closet?

660
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,840
Yes!

661
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,160
Yes!

662
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,880
Yes!
