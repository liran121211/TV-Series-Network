1
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,160
Most days, I'm Wonder Woman.

2
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,680
Invincible.

3
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,240
But some days, I'm not.

4
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,960
Everyone teaches us to be tough.

5
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,440
But why don't they teach us to
accept our vulnerabilities?

6
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,760
After all, who has created
these glass ceilings?

7
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:23,840
We did.

8
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,000
Us.

9
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,640
Women!

10
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,720
We feel we cannot break
through this glass ceiling.

11
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,320
But actually...

12
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,200
...if you believe...

13
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,760
…that there is no glass ceiling…

14
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,920
...then the sky is the limit.

15
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,440
Thank you so much.

16
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,480
Any questions?

17
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,840
Yes, Ms. Roy.

18
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,320
Hi, Uma.

19
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,200
I'm sorry but...

20
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,480
...did I just hear you say
what I think I did?

21
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,880
You really think that
women are hallucinating…

22
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,480
…about being held back by men?

23
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,960
All I am saying is that one
needs courage to be successful.

24
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:05,880
Not excuses.

25
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,000
Patriarchy is not some excuse.

26
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,840
Women have to work twice
as hard to reach half as far!

27
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,360
And this is the problem
with millennials…

28
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:18,000
…who look at everything from
a male vs female point of view.

29
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,560
When fighting for feminism, then yes.

30
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,200
Feminism is not about hating men.

31
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,240
Feminism means equality.

32
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,560
And this equality will only come…

33
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,400
…when we stop feeling
sorry for ourselves.

34
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,680
Papa, I made my first headline.

35
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:43,800
Really?

36
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,200
Breaking news!

37
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,000
The dining table has
brown sticky things underneath it.

38
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,000
Further investigations have revealed…

39
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,000
…that this is Ashok Rizvi Roy's booger.

40
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:54,760
Ashok?

41
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,040
No way Mom!

42
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,080
She's lying!

43
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,400
Mrs. Rizvi Roy,
would you like to check it yourself?

44
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,920
No! I believe you. Thank you!

45
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,320
Ashok Rizvi Roy…

46
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,880
…would you like to say
something in your defense?

47
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,720
When I grow up,
I'm going to be a journalist.

48
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,720
Just like my papa.

49
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,280
Ah!

50
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,160
There are my glasses.

51
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,440
Uma…

52
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:24,600
Hello.

53
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,080
I clearly remember
our first board meeting.

54
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,120
You said you were happy because...

55
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,880
...a woman was starting the company.

56
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,120
And now you're just
ganging up against me.

57
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,160
This is not some bus Damini…

58
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,440
…where you'll find a ladies seat.

59
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,160
I'm not asking for favours or handouts.

60
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,720
I'm asking for support,
woman to woman.

61
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,240
Support?
Ya!

62
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,360
I'm not your mother.

63
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,600
And please,

64
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,640
don't come to me with
your problems.

65
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,040
Come to me with your...

66
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:55,840
...solutions.

67
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,920
What are the solutions?

68
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,040
To undermine my editorial decisions?

69
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,080
Because the legal department
is just an excuse for you to censor me.

70
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,920
There is one solution, Damini.

71
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,240
Why don't you finally...

72
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,960
...take responsibility for your actions.

73
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,680
I take full responsibility Uma!

74
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,400
That's why I go after the lawbreakers
and offenders! You know that!

75
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,800
Oh…so you think you're a crusader?

76
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,360
You're a vigilante, girl.

77
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,480
There is a difference.

78
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,680
I'd rather be a vigilante
than be someone's puppet!

79
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,560
Stand up for me, Uma.

80
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,960
That's the least you can do.

81
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,880
I won't report a word
about this conversation...

82
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,400
...to our other board members.

83
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,480
And this…

84
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,200
This is me standing up for you.

85
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,800
Oh! Look who's here!

86
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,040
My baby!

87
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,000
Did you have fun at Dadda's?
 Yes!

88
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,240
What did you do?

89
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,760
One big poo and three little poo.

90
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,760
Oh my god!
We also went to the park…

91
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,920
...and we went swimming.

92
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:43,760
Wow!

93
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,760
But nothing is as exciting as a poo.

94
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,080
You can never compete with a
good poo, right Arya?

95
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,000
Here you go…

96
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,240
Dadda, doll house.

97
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,520
Oh yes! Doll house!

98
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,600
C'mon! C'mon!

99
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,520
May I go up?

100
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,640
Yes? Oh my God. C'mon!

101
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,800
Let's go before she changes her mind.

102
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,200
Anjana!

103
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,560
Hi!

104
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,440
Hi.

105
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,240
Hi.

106
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,640
Hi.

107
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,080
I'm...I'm Kavya.

108
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,800
Of course!

109
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,640
Hi Kavya…Hi…

110
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,480
I'm sorry, I didn't realise
there was someone in the car.

111
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,120
That's not your fault.

112
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,800
I mean brown dress…

113
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,280
...brown car upholstery.

114
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,960
Who even wears brown right?

115
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,840
Actually, I told Varun that I
will get camouflaged with the car seat

116
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:41,520
But he said that the brown
really brings out the color of my eyes.

117
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,880
Oh really?

118
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:43,880
He said that?

119
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,000
Ya, I know right?

120
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,760
By the way,
it's really nice to meet you finally…

121
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,960
…and I hope Arya didn't
trouble you too much.

122
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,960
No, no, she's such a doll!

123
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,440
And she's got a great sense of humour…

124
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,440
Smart and witty and...

125
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,240
...she picks up things so quickly!

126
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,280
I mean…I know…I'm her mother.

127
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,640
Oh and by the way, before I forget…

128
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,560
She wanted me to give you
the recipe of this ragi dosa…

129
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,360
And it's just…

130
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,160
Actually, it's very simple.
I'm sure you know…

131
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,080
Only don't forget to add
jaggery and butter on top.

132
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,200
She just…she loves that.
Thanks.

133
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,600
Wow…friends already?

134
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,480
Of course.

135
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,840
In fact, do you want to
do lunch sometime next week?

136
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,480
Sassy Spoon? Ya?

137
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,480
Ya…
It's close to our office...

138
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,680
...and we can exchange
notes about Mr Grumpy here.

139
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,280
He's so grumpy from the minute
he wakes up!

140
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,520
I am not grumpy. I'm chirpy.
No, of course you're not!

141
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:32,640
He's not…

142
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,720
Okay, so before you
guys become besties and all…

143
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,800
…we gotta go. Bye.

144
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,440
Bye.

145
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,120
Bye.

146
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:39,760
Bye.
See you.

147
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,520
It's so nice to meet you.
You're so sweet.

148
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,360
What a bitch.

149
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,200
With inspiration like this,
anyone can make six packs.

150
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,240
C'mon, five more.

151
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,920
I'm from Haryana.

152
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,600
Hot blood.

153
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,960
Give me one chance,

154
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,440
you won't regret it.

155
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,080
That's it.

156
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,160
Session over.

157
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,080
Did you get offended?
Oh my god!

158
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,080
Die! Bastard!

159
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,120
Fucking bitch!

160
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,760
Umang, we have security footage.

161
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,160
There's enough evidence.

162
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,560
They could sue us for
willfully harming a person.

163
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,800
That wasn't wilful.

164
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,200
He forced himself.
Didn't you see that?

165
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,640
Everyone knows what's
going on with you and Amit.

166
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,040
So he must've thought
you're easily available.

167
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,560
You can't demand respect, Umang.

168
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,680
You have to earn it.

169
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,720
I don't want respect
from these fuckers.

170
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,680
Tell them to keep their hands
off me and their junk in their pants.

171
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,440
Then, perhaps, you should also
learn how to keep your legs together.

172
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,320
You don't like that you're
a woman?

173
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,160
Do you hate yourself for it?

174
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,480
Didn't your parents love
you growing up?

175
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,520
Sorry, what?

176
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,000
Please transfer my
salary to my account.

177
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:58,960
I quit.

178
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,840
Umang, come back here.

179
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,760
Excuse me, where is the
beginner's ballet class?

180
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,400
3rd door.

181
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,480
Ok. Thank you.

182
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,280
By the way, parents are not
allowed to stay with their kids.

183
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,280
I should hope so.

184
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:23,840
Hi.

185
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,240
Hi.
This is the ballet class, right?

186
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,520
Yes.
The class will start in 5 minutes.

187
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,080
Please leave your child there.

188
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,320
What child?

189
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:31,920
Kid.

190
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:32,640
Kit?

191
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,280
Kid.

192
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,080
Of course, I have my kit!

193
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,480
No ma'am, kid.

194
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,040
Good afternoon, sir!

195
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,520
Good afternoon.

196
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,240
New ballet teacher?

197
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,880
She looks stupid to me.

198
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,880
I don't like her.

199
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,600
I'm going to tell my mom.

200
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,520
I'm not your ballet teacher,
I'm Siddhi Patel.

201
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,200
And I've also enrolled for this class.

202
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,440
Ma'am, this is beginner's ballet.

203
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,640
So? I'm no Anna Pavlova.

204
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,760
I mean for kids between 6 and 10.

205
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,640
What?!
Yes.

206
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,520
But…but your website
didn't mention that!

207
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,600
God, Sneha's going to kill me.

208
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,520
Shit! I even sent my driver back!

209
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,200
What do I do here now?

210
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,960
Sir, but why can't she
also take class with us?

211
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,960
No, but...
Yes!

212
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,520
Sir, please!

213
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,320
Okay, okay, quickly go change.

214
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:28,840
And 5, 6, 7, 8 and point...

215
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,520
Bring it back.

216
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,040
Plie.

217
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,880
And up.

218
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:39,880
And up 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...

219
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,080
And open.

220
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,120
3, 4…Plie.

221
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,600
Repeat.

222
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,880
And point.

223
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,600
And back.

224
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,840
Plie.

225
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,600
And...releve.

226
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:56,240
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

227
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,880
And open 2, 3, 4...

228
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,320
There's no glass ceiling.

229
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,120
We're all just imagining our problems!
She is so fake!

230
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,320
You can't even tell she's faking it!
She calls herself a liberal...

231
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,120
...but she thinks like a conservative!

232
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,640
Even the colour of her eye is fake!
What is that!

233
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,200
This is me standing up for you,
she says!

234
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,760
If liberals are like this I wonder
what a conservative is!

235
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,840
Her nose is definitely fake!

236
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,200
There is no glass ceiling!

237
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,840
This is a woman's world,
where men take women's last names!

238
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,640
Ladies.

239
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,880
Getting drunk in
the middle of a workday.

240
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,080
I'm confused.
Should I be happy or worried?

241
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,000
Worried.
Happy.

242
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,000
Muddied.

243
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,000
Bloodied.

244
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,640
Ok guys,

245
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,600
I know that currently
the villain in your life…

246
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,040
…is another woman.
Just like Sneha is mine.

247
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:46,640
But.

248
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,000
To tell you the truth…

249
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,360
Your cribbing?
It makes my world go round.

250
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,320
I mean, whenever
I hear you guys blabber…

251
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,640
I feel like I'm home.

252
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,320
And that…all is well with the world.

253
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,480
Awww.

254
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,160
All is well with the world!

255
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,640
Cheers!

256
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,400
The board, our own people,
want to censor us.

257
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,920
So what should we do?

258
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,520
Should we be scared?

259
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,720
Should we just sit idle?

260
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,680
Never.

261
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,560
We are going to go all out
with the kind of...

262
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,680
...journalism Investigator.com
is known for.

263
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,600
Bold, shocking, ballsy
fucking stories!

264
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,560
We are going to investigate
the hell out of Investigator.com!

265
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,440
Are you guys with me?

266
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,240
Yes.

267
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,160
Louder people!

268
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,320
Yes!

269
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,160
Good!

270
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,480
So give me those fucking stories!

271
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,320
I have one…

272
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,240
Walia’s extradition.
Who is protecting him?

273
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,240
Meth.
The new weight loss drug.

274
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,360
How deep is the
doctor-cops-drug dealer nexus?

275
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,560
On one hand,

276
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,960
we're becoming the world's
number one rape country...

277
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,160
and on the other hand,

278
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,880
women can’t even protest
against rape...

279
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,320
without being violently
attacked!

280
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,520
That's our story Asha.

281
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,800
Let's give women a voice
to express their dissent.

282
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,520
Let us be their voice.

283
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,560

284
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,880
Asha…you’re going to lead the story.

285
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,480
Get to work!

286
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,240
Umang.

287
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:25,960
Umang!

288
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,440
Umang.

289
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,400
Please spare me.
I don't want any advice.

290
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,280
Not advice.
I've come to congratulate you.

291
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,640
You're a rock solid woman.

292
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,040
Truly, respect.

293
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,400
Are you playing with me?

294
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,880
I'm in no mood for a joke.

295
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,920
There's a private client.

296
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,240
Very elite.

297
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,800
She has rejected everyone.

298
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,000
She needs a hardcore trainer
like you for personal training.

299
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,600
They say they need
a personal trainer...

300
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,440
...but they end up treating
you like a personal assistant.

301
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,480
It's a lot of money.

302
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,320
And you'll have to travel
with the client as well.

303
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,280
Set life.

304
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,840
Give me the number.

305
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,320
It's a high profile client.

306
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,280
I'll pass on your message
to her team.

307
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,480
They'll get in touch with you.

308
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,280
You know, you don't look
it but you're a pretty stand-up guy.

309
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,120
Was that an abuse or a compliment?

310
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,960
You're the one who comes
to me to get tortured!

311
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,120
Kavya, where are the depositions?

312
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,280
What? I am talking to you!

313
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,240
Ma'am, me?

314
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,240
Yes.

315
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,120
But ma'am, I'm Prachi.

316
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,520
And that's what I said.

317
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,560
No, ma'am. You said Kavya.

318
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,280
I'm…I'm so sorry.

319
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,720
Prachi, right?

320
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,400
You know Kavya was my
previous associate so...

321
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,560
...just a little confusion.

322
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,440
Can I have the deposition, please?

323
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,360
Sure ma'am.

324
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Two weeks.

325
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,280
My periods are two weeks late.

326
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,400
They're never late.

327
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,680
I'm not pregnant.

328
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,440
Unless it's an immaculate conception.

329
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,640
Don't worry, you're not pregnant.

330
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,240
Thank God!

331
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,640
Not that I have a problem
with babies.

332
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,160
I don't mind babies.
I like babies.

333
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,040
But tell me something…

334
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,120
…why do all women
need to feel maternal?

335
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,120
I think perpetuating the myth
of the maternal instinct...

336
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,440
...actually harms women.

337
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,760
And impairs their growth.

338
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:22,880
Don't you think?

339
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,320
I know I'm a gynac but as
a doctor can I ask you a question?

340
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,240
Sure.

341
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,560
When was the first time
you started exhibiting...

342
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,120
...signs of compulsive behavior?

343
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,000
Like this?

344
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,120
I just don't...

345
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,320
You know what…as a Muslim,
I've never felt like a minority.

346
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,720
But as a woman I have.

347
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,680
Amina, c'mon...

348
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,920
Arundhati Roy has
just now won the Booker.

349
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,200
Ya…Diana Haydon is
Ms. World.

350
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,800
Phoolan Devi just got
elected to parliament.

351
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,240
Ya…
Indian women are everywhere.

352
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:53,880
Please.

353
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,640
Three women amongst a million men.

354
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,160
And we should celebrate!

355
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:01,240
We can't even sell a car
without a half naked woman.

356
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,160
Women are looked upon
as sexual beings!

357
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,040
Look at the kind of
songs we have.

358
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,120
"You bloody sexy thing!"

359
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,680
Damini, what do you
have to say to this?

360
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:14,120
C'mon, Mahesh. She's just a child.
What would she know?

361
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,640
No, no, we don't differentiate
in this house. Right?

362
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,160
Mama…I'm hungry.

363
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,040
Food's ready in the kitchen,
sweetheart.

364
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,480
Go have it. Good girl.

365
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,200
So I'm going to recommend…

366
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:54,480
…a therapist.

367
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,080
A therapist?
Yep.

368
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,640
As in a shrink?

369
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,520
I don't need a shrink.

370
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,080
It's my shitty hormones
and vagina that need fixing.

371
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,120
Not my brain.

372
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,680
Your vagina is fine.

373
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:09,600
It's perfect.

374
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:18,560
To a great first date.

375
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,160
To a great first date.

376
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,160
Proost!

377
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,840
Proost means cheers in Dutch.

378
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:25,560
Oh...

379
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,040
Okay…

380
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,800
You know, I mean I just love to travel.

381
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,920
Like especially since I
got that new chartered airplane.

382
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,760
You know my friend's dad
also owns one.

383
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,280
Yeah well,
you know, that's the difference.

384
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,760
I'm a self-made man, Sindhi.

385
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:36,640
Siddhi.

386
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,680
Siddhi, ya of course.

387
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,960
Look, to be honest Siddhi…

388
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,280
Everytime I come to India…

389
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:43,760
…my parents set me
up with some eligible girl.

390
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,160
But somehow I've never really
found someone who truly gets me.

391
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,240
Like the real me.

392
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:48,960
You know what I'm saying?

393
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,000
I think I need to meet someone
who knows where I've come from…

394
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,600
…and where I'm going.

395
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,000
Hibiscus. Have you heard of us?

396
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,080
Not really.

397
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,120
But, you know, my friend Damini?
She has her own company…

398
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,640
Yeah, well I mean, I'm sure
that's great for her here in Mumbai…

399
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,240
…but babe, you're really
nothing till you haven't...

400
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,280
...made it big in Silicon Valley.

401
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,440
I mean, c'mon…

402
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:06,560
Oh…okay.

403
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,800
It's like, you know,
Mark is my neighbor.

404
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:10,160
Mark?

405
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,680
Zuckerberg? Facebook?

406
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,680
Really?!
Ya.

407
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,720
So do you guys like
hang out and stuff?

408
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,720
Well, we go to the
same coffee shop.

409
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,200
So do Salman and I
but we're not friends.

410
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:20,960
Rushdie?

411
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:22,920
Khan.

412
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,200
Salman Khan?

413
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:26,880
I hate Bollywood.

414
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,440
You know, as a kid,
when I used to travel to America…

415
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,960
…I used to love sticking
my head out of the sunroof.

416
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,520
Driver, sunroof.

417
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,080
Really?!

418
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:56,560
Ya.

419
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:21,400
God! Your feet are so beautiful!

420
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,720
If your feet were on a
dating app…

421
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,040
…you'd get maximum right
swipes baby!

422
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,520
Owww! What the fuck!

423
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,560
Oh my God! I'm so sorry!

424
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:33,160
I really didn't mean to… shit!
Blood! Blood!

425
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,880
I think you've broken my nose,
you psycho!

426
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:35,760
Oops.

427
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,320
What am I going to do?
I love my nose!

428
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,520
According to Leonardo
Da Vinci's golden ratio…

429
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:40,960
…my nose is perfect for my face!

430
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,320
Listen, relax! It's just a nose bleed!

431
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,520
What?! Are you crazy?!
What if it's permanently damaged?!

432
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:46,760
God!

433
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,320
What are you doing?!

434
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,040
I don't have a tissue
but here…use this.

435
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:51,920
Oh my God. No!

436
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,280
You want me to put this
on my face?!

437
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:54,440
It's not used.

438
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,280
Driver, stop the car.

439
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,560
Seriously?

440
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,280
Shut up!

441
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,640
What did you tell Sneha?

442
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:12,560
Simple.

443
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,400
That Pawan is a non vegetarian.

444
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,640
And will expect the
same from me after marriage.

445
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:18,560
Shame…

446
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:22,200
John Mayer has said
'My body is a wonderland'.

447
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,240
How can I just defile…
Ooh! Chicken wings!

448
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,760
By the way,
Kavya called Varun Mr. Grumpy.

449
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,520
Anj, you're still
obsessing with that girl.

450
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,320
She is playing a game
with me and I will not…

451
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,160
Shit!

452
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:36,920
Woah!

453
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,800
I'm so sorry. My bad!

454
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,680
Nice catch, Jeh.

455
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,480
Guys! Samara Kapoor!

456
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,640
Guess who yelled at her…

457
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,720
And I still feel shit about it.

458
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,320
She is my childhood crush.

459
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:49,800
I love her!

460
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:52,320
I mean she's bubbly,
she's pretty, she's hot…

461
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,040
I wish I could
take her to the fields...

462
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,040
...and do some body
weight exercises with her!

463
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,200
One more time.

464
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,880
I've got the trick now.
Siddhi, c'mon do something.

465
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:01,800
Something.

466
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:02,720
Sneha!

467
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,400
Look up and smile bitches!

468
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:24,880
Hey, all good?

469
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:27,080
What?

470
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:28,400
Nothing.

471
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:30,960
Hey, can I ask you a question?

472
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:32,520
Ya...

473
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,440
How come you've been
hanging back here lately?

474
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:36,920
Is that a problem?

475
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,320
No, no. Not at all.

476
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:39,920
Of course not. I'm...

477
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,000
I'm just curious.

478
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:47,520
I've just been stressed
with work lately…

479
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,160
And I guess I don't
feel like going back...

480
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,680
...to that empty house
all alone anymore.

481
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,560
The walls feel like they're...

482
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,800
...closing in on me.

483
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,040
You know what I mean?

484
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:05,520
Trust me, I do.

485
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,880
The Japanese have invented something.

486
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,800
It's called the
boyfriend-girlfriend coat.

487
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,440
So you wear it and…

488
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:17,160
then it hugs you and…

489
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,040
...asks you how your day was.

490
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,560
I should leave.
No wait.

491
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:30,560
Hang on.

492
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:32,280
What?

493
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,440
Japanese single malt.

494
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,320
To the dichotomy of living alone.

495
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,040
Can't live with someone…

496
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,320
Can't live without someone?

497
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,880
Cheers.
Cheers.

498
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:57,760
I love it.

499
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,480
Hi Anj…

500
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:11,400
Hey…

501
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:16,960
She sleeping?

502
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:18,240
Ya...

503
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:20,280
What's going on?

504
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:22,200
You want to come in?

505
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,120
No, I'm sorry I…

506
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,640
…I shouldn't be disturbing
you at this hour.

507
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,600
Look...

508
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,200
Kavya's not home.

509
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,080
Please.

510
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,800
Just come inside.

511
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,600
Don't be so formal.

512
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:44,240
Coffee?

513
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:47,680
The one thing I did well…

514
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,080
...when we were married.

515
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,080
No, I'm fine.

516
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:52,760
Come.

517
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,800
Actually, we were watching TV…

518
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,200
…there were these cartoons on.

519
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:01,880
And she fell asleep here so...
It's…

520
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,200
It's okay.

521
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:05,720
Sit.

522
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,400
Sometimes I can't believe
she's ours.

523
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,120
Remember as a baby how
she would sleep?

524
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,120
Those little froggy legs.

525
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,720
And her arms by the side
of her head.

526
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,000
She's too beautiful.

527
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,400
And we created that.

528
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,160
Can you imagine?

529
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:37,760
We.

530
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,000
The two of us.

531
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,360
Two complete nutcases…

532
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:43,280
…created that.

533
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,040
Shit. I totally forgot to tell you.

534
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,680
Kavya had written
down that dosa recipe.

535
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,080
And she said to give it to you.

536
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,640
You know, I think I'll just
book a cab.

537
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,560
I have like a 9am meeting.

538
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,440
Ya?
Ya.

539
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:15,200
You sure?

540
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:24,200
Rish.

541
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:25,720
Hi…

542
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:27,000
Hi, hottie.

543
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:29,960
When did you get into town?

544
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,080
Just this weekend.

545
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:33,160
A message would've been nice.

546
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,640
Ya but this is so much
more spontaneous.

547
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:36,520
And…

548
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:38,240
Sexy.

549
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:50,560
Did you come?

550
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:52,720
Nope.

551
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:54,160
No?

552
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,000
Okay...

553
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:18,920
Every time.

554
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:20,680
Every time.

555
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:31,280
How's work?

556
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,080
Same old, same old.

557
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,320
Always the secretive Damini.

558
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:48,840
Rishabh…

559
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,880
Let me stay tonight…

560
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,160
You know me.
You know how I am…

561
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,640
Ya...I know.

562
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:58,880
I know.
