1
03:34:34,740 --> 03:34:37,860
When you let something
simmer for too long,

2
03:34:37,900 --> 03:34:39,780
it will explode.

3
03:34:39,820 --> 03:34:41,380
Emotionally,
physically,

4
03:34:41,420 --> 03:34:43,620
metaphysically.

5
03:34:59,820 --> 03:35:01,460
You're a good boy, Xerxes.

6
03:35:01,500 --> 03:35:03,780
You a good boy or not?

7
03:35:03,820 --> 03:35:05,420
Do you like it here
in Goa?

8
03:35:05,460 --> 03:35:06,980
Are you a good boy?

9
03:35:07,020 --> 03:35:08,660
Are you a good boy
or not?

10
03:35:08,700 --> 03:35:09,460
Are you going to lick me?

11
03:35:09,460 --> 03:35:10,980
Jeh uncle's girlfriend?

12
03:35:11,020 --> 03:35:12,620
No.

13
03:35:12,660 --> 03:35:14,700
Then why are you wearing
his shirt?

14
03:35:14,740 --> 03:35:16,660
Why were you sleeping
in Jeh uncle's room?

15
03:35:17,900 --> 03:35:20,060
'Cause he's my friend?

16
03:35:22,020 --> 03:35:24,620
Ewww...you smell like poo!

17
03:35:24,660 --> 03:35:26,580
Poo! Poo! Poo!

18
03:35:29,260 --> 03:35:30,380
They're right, Xerxes.

19
03:35:30,420 --> 03:35:32,300
I smell.

20
03:35:32,340 --> 03:35:33,340
Can you smell me?

21
03:35:33,380 --> 03:35:35,220
You're always welcome
to shower.

22
03:35:35,260 --> 03:35:36,340
Hi...

23
03:35:36,380 --> 03:35:37,580
Goa suits you.

24
03:35:37,620 --> 03:35:38,740
Does it?

25
03:35:38,780 --> 03:35:40,860
Ya, you look relaxed.

26
03:35:40,900 --> 03:35:43,260
More relaxed than I've
ever seen you before.

27
03:35:45,380 --> 03:35:46,380
Right.

28
03:35:47,340 --> 03:35:49,460
Keep smiling like this.

29
03:35:49,500 --> 03:35:51,500
This whole world's burden...

30
03:35:51,540 --> 03:35:53,100
...that you're carrying...

31
03:35:53,140 --> 03:35:55,420
...will get lighter.

32
03:35:55,460 --> 03:35:58,100
I have permanently
hunched shoulders.

33
03:35:58,140 --> 03:35:59,500
You know...

34
03:35:59,540 --> 03:36:01,180
Got into the habit
when I hit puberty.....

35
03:36:01,220 --> 03:36:03,340
...trying to hide my boobs.

36
03:36:03,380 --> 03:36:04,740
But they're nice boobs.
Why hide them?

37
03:36:18,700 --> 03:36:19,780
Really, Xerxes?

38
03:36:19,820 --> 03:36:21,540
No loyalty?

39
03:36:21,580 --> 03:36:22,820
You really are a dog.

40
03:37:13,460 --> 03:37:14,860
Shut up, guys!

41
03:37:16,660 --> 03:37:18,380
Twenty three years...

42
03:37:18,420 --> 03:37:20,020
...you held on to
your virginity.

43
03:37:20,060 --> 03:37:21,780
And suddenly one night,

44
03:37:21,820 --> 03:37:23,300
against the lighthouse walls...

45
03:37:23,340 --> 03:37:25,900
Bang! Yes baby...

46
03:37:25,940 --> 03:37:28,660
Guys, stop it. Stop it!
-Siddhu got her cherry popped.

47
03:37:28,700 --> 03:37:30,180
Siddhu got her cherry popped.

48
03:37:30,220 --> 03:37:32,060
Siddhu got her cherry popped.
-Okay guys, seriously.

49
03:37:32,100 --> 03:37:33,340
It's not a big deal okay.

50
03:37:33,380 --> 03:37:34,860
I just lost my virginity.

51
03:37:34,900 --> 03:37:36,300
Not like I won an Oscar.

52
03:37:36,340 --> 03:37:37,980
Question is,
did he win one...

53
03:37:38,020 --> 03:37:40,140
...for his performance!

54
03:37:40,180 --> 03:37:41,780
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

55
03:37:41,820 --> 03:37:43,100
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

56
03:37:43,140 --> 03:37:44,620
You guys are actually cray...
-Oh, yeah!

57
03:37:44,660 --> 03:37:45,980
But I love it.

58
03:37:46,020 --> 03:37:47,180
By the way, by removing
the 'Z' from crazy...

59
03:37:47,220 --> 03:37:49,020
...how much time do
you save?

60
03:37:49,060 --> 03:37:50,740
I take the 'O' out of OK
as well.

61
03:37:50,780 --> 03:37:52,020
So it adds up.

62
03:37:53,020 --> 03:37:54,380
Such a child.

63
03:37:54,420 --> 03:37:56,780
But do you know who's
not a child anymore?

64
03:37:56,820 --> 03:37:58,820
Our very own Siddhi.

65
03:37:58,860 --> 03:38:00,780
Now she's a woman.

66
03:38:00,820 --> 03:38:02,460
Okay, enough about me.

67
03:38:02,500 --> 03:38:03,700
What about your girlfriend?

68
03:38:03,740 --> 03:38:04,740
What? What? What?

69
03:38:04,780 --> 03:38:06,300
Mangs has a girlfriend?

70
03:38:06,340 --> 03:38:07,900
Check this out.
-Siddhi...

71
03:38:07,940 --> 03:38:10,380
Look at it.
Samara frickin' Kapoor!

72
03:38:10,420 --> 03:38:11,340
What the fuck!

73
03:38:11,380 --> 03:38:12,900
She's into girls?

74
03:38:12,940 --> 03:38:14,140
Wow! That's...

75
03:38:14,180 --> 03:38:15,500
That's makes her even hotter!

76
03:38:15,540 --> 03:38:17,660
Samara Kapoor?
-Sa...Samara Kapoor?

77
03:38:21,020 --> 03:38:22,860
Oh, my god!
-Mangs!

78
03:38:22,900 --> 03:38:24,020
Okay! Okay! Okay!

79
03:38:24,060 --> 03:38:25,740
- Knock knock.
- Who's there?

80
03:38:25,780 --> 03:38:27,140
- Hymen.
- Hymen who?

81
03:38:27,180 --> 03:38:28,780
Hymen the mood for some
girl-on-girl action...

82
03:38:28,820 --> 03:38:30,660
...with a superstar!

83
03:38:30,700 --> 03:38:31,860
Sids, please!

84
03:38:31,900 --> 03:38:33,180
Don't distract us from
your hymen!

85
03:38:33,220 --> 03:38:34,980
Seriously, why didn't you
tell us before?

86
03:38:35,020 --> 03:38:37,540
And she tells us about
every silly one night stand.

87
03:38:37,580 --> 03:38:39,460
But you hid this from us!

88
03:38:39,500 --> 03:38:40,420
Because like...

89
03:38:40,460 --> 03:38:41,780
She asked you to hide it.

90
03:38:41,820 --> 03:38:42,860
No.

91
03:38:42,900 --> 03:38:44,580
Because...
this time...

92
03:38:44,620 --> 03:38:45,900
...it's just different.

93
03:38:45,940 --> 03:38:47,060
Why?

94
03:38:47,100 --> 03:38:48,060
'Cause she's famous.

95
03:38:48,100 --> 03:38:49,420
No, ya...

96
03:38:50,700 --> 03:38:52,140
'Cause I'm in love with her.

97
03:38:54,220 --> 03:38:55,940
Like proper, proper love?

98
03:38:55,940 --> 03:38:57,860
Yes. And...

99
03:38:57,900 --> 03:39:00,860
I just figured after Pinky...

100
03:39:00,900 --> 03:39:03,900
...I would never have these
intense love feelings.

101
03:39:03,940 --> 03:39:06,500
But once Samara and
I got together...

102
03:39:06,580 --> 03:39:07,900
When I'm with her,

103
03:39:07,940 --> 03:39:10,020
I don't even want to look at
anyone else.

104
03:39:10,060 --> 03:39:12,260
You know, it's so perfect.

105
03:39:12,300 --> 03:39:14,300
Like ice cream and gulab jamun.
(Indian delicacy)

106
03:39:14,340 --> 03:39:16,580
Like jalebi and rabdi.
(Indian delicacy)

107
03:39:16,620 --> 03:39:18,620
Like chana chaval.
(Indian delicacy)

108
03:39:18,620 --> 03:39:21,780
Mangs, you really
are in love...

109
03:39:26,060 --> 03:39:28,820
Ladies, mojitos
made fresh with...

110
03:39:28,860 --> 03:39:30,220
...mint and lemons from
the orchards.

111
03:39:30,260 --> 03:39:31,700
What's up.
-In the house...

112
03:39:31,740 --> 03:39:33,020
...and on the house.
-Thank you.

113
03:39:33,060 --> 03:39:34,060
Excuse me,

114
03:39:34,140 --> 03:39:35,420
fancy cocktails?

115
03:39:35,460 --> 03:39:36,900
What happened to
your rules?

116
03:39:36,940 --> 03:39:38,260
Jeh has changed.

117
03:39:38,300 --> 03:39:39,340
Ya guys...

118
03:39:39,380 --> 03:39:40,940
I mean, this is Goa.

119
03:39:41,020 --> 03:39:42,060
Everything's different here.

120
03:39:48,020 --> 03:39:49,380
Sid...

121
03:39:49,420 --> 03:39:50,500
Your phone.

122
03:39:50,500 --> 03:39:51,900
Oh, thanks.
You don't need it?

123
03:39:51,940 --> 03:39:54,060
No.
Jeh lent me a spare.

124
03:39:54,060 --> 03:39:55,780
Oh.

125
03:39:55,820 --> 03:39:56,860
Sharing bedrooms,

126
03:39:56,900 --> 03:39:58,460
sharing phones.

127
03:39:58,500 --> 03:40:00,060
Sharing clothes,
sharing glances.

128
03:40:00,060 --> 03:40:01,620
Okay, okay.
Guys, guys...

129
03:40:01,620 --> 03:40:03,380
You are all invited to
my parents'...

130
03:40:03,420 --> 03:40:05,380
...fortieth wedding
anniversary celebrations.

131
03:40:05,420 --> 03:40:07,180
-Oh.
-And my mum insists

132
03:40:07,220 --> 03:40:10,820
on sharing the day with
our birthday girl here.

133
03:40:10,860 --> 03:40:12,100
And Anjana,

134
03:40:12,140 --> 03:40:13,540
bring your friend along.

135
03:40:13,580 --> 03:40:14,460
What friend?

136
03:40:14,500 --> 03:40:16,220
Your child!
-Oh!

137
03:40:16,260 --> 03:40:17,740
She forgot about him.
-You forgot!

138
03:40:17,780 --> 03:40:19,980
You forgot about him?

139
03:40:20,020 --> 03:40:22,660
Cheers...
-Cheers to that!

140
03:40:37,300 --> 03:40:38,860
There you are.

141
03:40:38,900 --> 03:40:39,500
Hey...

142
03:40:39,540 --> 03:40:40,900
Come on in.

143
03:40:40,940 --> 03:40:42,700
The water's great.

144
03:40:42,740 --> 03:40:45,700
I'm not falling for that
one again.

145
03:40:45,740 --> 03:40:46,860
Don't you have a pool
in your hotel?

146
03:40:46,900 --> 03:40:48,700
It's filled with noisy kids.

147
03:40:48,740 --> 03:40:49,700
Whoa!

148
03:40:52,540 --> 03:40:53,540
So is this pool.

149
03:40:54,580 --> 03:40:56,500
Yes, but...

150
03:40:56,540 --> 03:40:57,940
You're not in my hotel.

151
03:40:59,780 --> 03:41:01,500
I'm a leech.

152
03:41:01,540 --> 03:41:02,580
Stuck on you.

153
03:41:13,740 --> 03:41:15,500
Bar's open.

154
03:41:15,540 --> 03:41:16,860
Cocktail?

155
03:41:20,860 --> 03:41:22,340
Nice rings...colourful.

156
03:41:22,380 --> 03:41:24,180
Damini!
Over here.

157
03:41:24,220 --> 03:41:25,340
Hi!
-Hi!

158
03:41:25,380 --> 03:41:26,220
Hey!
-Hello...

159
03:41:26,260 --> 03:41:27,420
Hi!

160
03:41:27,460 --> 03:41:29,100
Happy anniversary
Mr and Mrs Wadia.

161
03:41:29,140 --> 03:41:30,860
Thank you.
-Ms D'Costa.

162
03:41:30,900 --> 03:41:33,180
I didn't add Wadia to
my name.

163
03:41:33,220 --> 03:41:35,500
This Wadia is
completely insane!

164
03:41:37,020 --> 03:41:38,460
Okay, Ms D'Costa.

165
03:41:39,500 --> 03:41:41,140
By the way, Damini...

166
03:41:41,180 --> 03:41:42,380
This morning, from
under the blanket,

167
03:41:42,420 --> 03:41:44,300
I could only see
your eyes.

168
03:41:44,340 --> 03:41:46,780
Nice to see you in full
my dear girl.

169
03:41:48,620 --> 03:41:49,820
But really...

170
03:41:49,860 --> 03:41:50,940
Isn't she beautiful?

171
03:41:50,980 --> 03:41:51,780
Yes.

172
03:41:51,820 --> 03:41:52,940
Well done, Jeh.

173
03:41:52,980 --> 03:41:54,620
We had lost total hope
in you.

174
03:41:55,900 --> 03:41:58,460
I'll go get a drink.
-Yes, please.

175
03:42:07,620 --> 03:42:08,940
Mihir is texting.

176
03:42:08,980 --> 03:42:10,220
Why?

177
03:42:10,260 --> 03:42:11,660
Because you guys did it
last night.

178
03:42:11,700 --> 03:42:13,740
He probably does have good
morning-after etiquette?

179
03:42:13,780 --> 03:42:15,020
But if I reply immediately,

180
03:42:15,060 --> 03:42:16,980
he's going to think
I'm really desperate.

181
03:42:17,020 --> 03:42:18,460
Says who?

182
03:42:18,500 --> 03:42:19,980
I read it in a magazine.

183
03:42:20,020 --> 03:42:20,940
Don't chase boys.

184
03:42:20,980 --> 03:42:22,780
Let them do it.

185
03:42:22,820 --> 03:42:24,740
What do you feel like doing?

186
03:42:24,780 --> 03:42:26,820
Oh, no. I don't know.

187
03:42:26,860 --> 03:42:29,140
What if he thinks
I'm some stuck up bitch?

188
03:42:29,180 --> 03:42:31,340
Also, I don't want it to seem
like it's a big deal we had...

189
03:42:32,340 --> 03:42:33,900
...you know.

190
03:42:33,940 --> 03:42:35,460
But if I reply immediately,

191
03:42:35,500 --> 03:42:36,820
he'll think I'm obsessing
over him...

192
03:42:36,860 --> 03:42:38,020
...because he was my first.

193
03:42:38,060 --> 03:42:39,660
And if I don't then,

194
03:42:39,700 --> 03:42:41,300
what if he thinks I hated it?

195
03:42:42,700 --> 03:42:45,340
Not that I hated it,
it's just...

196
03:42:45,380 --> 03:42:46,500
It just wasn't anything like...

197
03:42:46,540 --> 03:42:48,300
...what I'd expected, you know.

198
03:42:48,340 --> 03:42:50,180
It really hurt and that...

199
03:42:50,220 --> 03:42:51,220
...that wall was so cold.

200
03:42:51,260 --> 03:42:52,260
So bored.

201
03:42:56,060 --> 03:42:58,340
What're you doing?
Mohit?

202
03:42:58,380 --> 03:42:59,940
Mohit, stop it! Give it to me.

203
03:42:59,980 --> 03:43:01,180
Mohit! Stop it!
-Invitation sent!

204
03:43:01,220 --> 03:43:02,700
Location sent!

205
03:43:08,820 --> 03:43:09,780
Enjoy.

206
03:43:20,100 --> 03:43:22,300
Today's generation...

207
03:43:22,340 --> 03:43:24,060
...has no patience.

208
03:43:24,100 --> 03:43:25,980
We used to put roses in
our log books...

209
03:43:26,020 --> 03:43:27,220
...for our boyfriends.

210
03:43:27,220 --> 03:43:28,980
For one phone call...

211
03:43:29,020 --> 03:43:31,140
...we used to wait for hours.

212
03:43:31,180 --> 03:43:32,140
To speak with our boyfriend.

213
03:43:32,180 --> 03:43:33,140
Not boyfriend.

214
03:43:33,180 --> 03:43:33,980
I have a girlfriend.

215
03:43:34,020 --> 03:43:35,460
Ooh! Girlfriend!

216
03:43:35,460 --> 03:43:36,820
Speak louder please.

217
03:43:36,860 --> 03:43:38,140
She's a lesbian.

218
03:43:38,180 --> 03:43:40,460
Ooh!

219
03:43:40,460 --> 03:43:42,660
Come, come. Sit here.

220
03:43:42,700 --> 03:43:44,700
Come, come.

221
03:43:44,740 --> 03:43:46,580
Tanaz aunty and Delnaz aunty...

222
03:43:46,580 --> 03:43:49,420
...also did hanky-panky
in the Bharuch house.

223
03:43:49,460 --> 03:43:50,420
So what?

224
03:43:50,460 --> 03:43:51,460
Men.

225
03:43:51,460 --> 03:43:53,140
They are like donkeys.

226
03:43:53,180 --> 03:43:54,460
No brains whatsoever!

227
03:43:54,460 --> 03:43:56,540
Forty five years.

228
03:43:56,580 --> 03:43:59,860
Kaizad never satisfied me!

229
03:43:59,900 --> 03:44:02,300
At first, he used to hurry
through it.

230
03:44:02,340 --> 03:44:04,980
Later, he decided to
slow down.

231
03:44:05,020 --> 03:44:07,580
But he was never able to
catch my speed.

232
03:44:07,660 --> 03:44:09,700
You are very lucky, young lady.

233
03:44:09,740 --> 03:44:13,420
You can live your life openly.

234
03:44:13,460 --> 03:44:16,100
Tanaz aunty and Delnaz aunty...

235
03:44:16,140 --> 03:44:17,780
...committed suicide.

236
03:44:18,860 --> 03:44:20,460
They couldn't live together...

237
03:44:20,460 --> 03:44:21,820
...so they died together.

238
03:44:23,100 --> 03:44:27,100
I love my nipples
to be nibbled!

239
03:44:27,140 --> 03:44:28,020
Oh, God!

240
03:44:29,820 --> 03:44:31,060
I hope you take care of her...

241
03:44:31,100 --> 03:44:32,900
...and she takes care of you.

242
03:44:32,940 --> 03:44:34,220
Ya, we try.

243
03:44:34,300 --> 03:44:35,660
Kaizad and I,

244
03:44:35,700 --> 03:44:38,340
we tried anal sex also.

245
03:44:38,340 --> 03:44:40,900
Very pleasurable.

246
03:44:40,940 --> 03:44:41,980
Naughty girl!

247
03:44:43,580 --> 03:44:44,700
So what!

248
03:44:47,460 --> 03:44:49,060
I don't eat raw food.

249
03:44:50,140 --> 03:44:51,820
Try it.
It's an aphrodisiac.

250
03:44:51,860 --> 03:44:54,660
Apparently so are chocolate
covered strawberries.

251
03:44:54,700 --> 03:44:56,660
But they just make me
put on weight, that's all.

252
03:44:56,700 --> 03:44:58,580
That's because you
have to work it off.

253
03:44:58,580 --> 03:44:59,540
Afterwards.

254
03:45:02,340 --> 03:45:04,420
I am horrible at flirty talk.

255
03:45:04,460 --> 03:45:05,860
At this point,
all I can think of is my...

256
03:45:05,900 --> 03:45:07,340
...sweaty spinning teacher...

257
03:45:07,340 --> 03:45:09,940
...shouting 'Faster! Faster!'

258
03:45:09,980 --> 03:45:11,740
I can make you spin.

259
03:45:11,780 --> 03:45:13,300
And sweat.

260
03:45:13,340 --> 03:45:14,980
While you scream
'Faster! Faster!'

261
03:45:17,860 --> 03:45:19,100
The oyster's still waiting.

262
03:45:25,460 --> 03:45:26,340
Let's do this.

263
03:45:31,260 --> 03:45:32,580
This vodka-cranberry popsicle...

264
03:45:32,620 --> 03:45:34,700
...is the undisputed popsicle
king.

265
03:45:34,740 --> 03:45:36,540
I mean, it is life affirming.

266
03:45:36,580 --> 03:45:37,740
Shows how low your
self-esteem is...

267
03:45:37,780 --> 03:45:40,100
considering you're getting your
affirmations from shaved ice.

268
03:45:40,140 --> 03:45:41,620
I get mine from shaved pubes.

269
03:45:43,500 --> 03:45:44,580
Gross. Thanks!

270
03:45:48,860 --> 03:45:51,140
Oh, God. He's here.

271
03:45:51,180 --> 03:45:52,020
What?

272
03:45:53,700 --> 03:45:55,380
Oh, shit! My popsicle!

273
03:45:55,420 --> 03:45:57,300
Popsicle?
Is that what you call him now?

274
03:45:57,340 --> 03:45:58,820
Mr Cherry Popper?

275
03:45:58,860 --> 03:46:00,380
Mohit, please! Just hide me.

276
03:46:00,420 --> 03:46:02,460
My ass is not that big.

277
03:46:02,500 --> 03:46:03,940
What does he look like?

278
03:46:03,980 --> 03:46:04,780
What?

279
03:46:04,820 --> 03:46:06,300
He's a guy.

280
03:46:06,340 --> 03:46:08,180
Wow. That narrows it down.

281
03:46:08,220 --> 03:46:09,900
Mihir!
-What are you doing?

282
03:46:09,940 --> 03:46:11,140
Mihir!

283
03:46:11,180 --> 03:46:13,980
Mihir! Hey, this way man!

284
03:46:14,020 --> 03:46:15,460
He's cute. In a very banker
sort of way.

285
03:46:15,500 --> 03:46:17,940
Hey, Mihir!
-Horrible!

286
03:46:17,980 --> 03:46:18,940
Hey...

287
03:46:18,980 --> 03:46:20,380
Hey, I dropped my popsicle.

288
03:46:20,420 --> 03:46:21,700
I need another one.

289
03:46:24,140 --> 03:46:25,420
Mihir...

290
03:46:25,460 --> 03:46:26,740
Hi, Mohit.
-Hi...

291
03:46:26,780 --> 03:46:27,980
I'm Siddhi's new bestie.

292
03:46:28,020 --> 03:46:29,460
-Oh, nice.
-Tell me...

293
03:46:29,500 --> 03:46:30,900
Do you really live in
New York...

294
03:46:30,940 --> 03:46:33,820
...or you're just saying
Newark in a hybrid accent?

295
03:46:33,860 --> 03:46:35,300
Sorry, what?

296
03:46:35,340 --> 03:46:37,340
-She's ignoring you.
-Why?

297
03:46:37,380 --> 03:46:40,300
-I call it the MALV syndrome.
-What's that?

298
03:46:40,340 --> 03:46:42,740
Morning After Losing Virginity?

299
03:46:57,180 --> 03:46:58,420
Is the door shut?

300
03:47:12,740 --> 03:47:13,980
Hey, Siddi-Piddi...

301
03:47:15,220 --> 03:47:16,900
Look, about last night...

302
03:47:16,940 --> 03:47:18,260
Okay. This is taking too long.

303
03:47:18,300 --> 03:47:19,260
I changed my mind.

304
03:47:19,300 --> 03:47:20,460
Sorry, I don't want it.

305
03:47:34,780 --> 03:47:35,900
Siddi-Piddi, can we just talk?

306
03:47:35,940 --> 03:47:37,780
I really need to pee.

307
03:47:37,820 --> 03:47:39,060
Fuck!

308
03:47:58,420 --> 03:47:59,380
I have to...

309
03:47:59,420 --> 03:48:00,500
Make a phone call,

310
03:48:00,540 --> 03:48:02,460
get a popsicle,
go pee,

311
03:48:02,500 --> 03:48:03,340
have a snack,

312
03:48:03,380 --> 03:48:04,340
pick some coconut,

313
03:48:04,380 --> 03:48:05,580
save the world,

314
03:48:05,620 --> 03:48:07,740
...stand for President.
-What the hell?

315
03:48:07,780 --> 03:48:09,460
Oh, shit, I'm so sorry.
 Prime Minister.

316
03:48:09,500 --> 03:48:11,780
I forgot, the head of state
here is the Prime Minister.

317
03:48:13,500 --> 03:48:14,900
I really have to go.
-You've got...

318
03:48:14,940 --> 03:48:16,780
You've got to be
kidding me, Siddhi...

319
03:48:16,820 --> 03:48:18,500
Shit! Damini...

320
03:48:21,020 --> 03:48:22,140
Don't sell out, Uma.

321
03:48:22,180 --> 03:48:23,180
Please.

322
03:48:26,220 --> 03:48:28,700
Surviving by pimping
out Investigator.com?

323
03:48:33,740 --> 03:48:35,380
It's funny.

324
03:48:35,420 --> 03:48:38,900
You know, all this while
I thought you were on my side.

325
03:48:38,940 --> 03:48:40,140
What are you trying to say?

326
03:48:44,700 --> 03:48:45,820
Out?

327
03:48:45,860 --> 03:48:47,420
From where?

328
03:48:49,740 --> 03:48:50,780
What?

329
03:48:50,820 --> 03:48:52,300
I'm sorry?

330
03:48:58,780 --> 03:49:00,540
You're the one who's been
pushing me!

331
03:49:00,580 --> 03:49:02,900
I'm the founder of
Investigator.com, goddammit!

332
03:49:06,740 --> 03:49:07,980
You can't...

333
03:49:08,020 --> 03:49:10,460
I've given my life to
Investigator.com, okay?

334
03:49:10,500 --> 03:49:12,740
My everything!
You cannot remove me!

335
03:49:15,300 --> 03:49:18,580
Fuck you! Fuck you and fuck
the entire board Uma!

336
03:49:18,620 --> 03:49:19,780
I won't let you do this okay!

337
03:49:19,820 --> 03:49:22,220
I will not let you do this!

338
03:49:22,260 --> 03:49:23,580
Hello!

339
03:49:23,620 --> 03:49:24,740
Uma!

340
03:49:43,700 --> 03:49:45,340
Let's hide here!
Let's hide here!

341
03:49:45,380 --> 03:49:47,260
Let's hide here!
-Shut the door! Shut the door!

342
03:49:47,300 --> 03:49:48,260
Who are you?

343
03:49:48,300 --> 03:49:50,660
This is Aunty Diana's room.

344
03:49:50,700 --> 03:49:52,420
No it's not. It's Jeh's room.

345
03:49:52,460 --> 03:49:54,420
And I've taken his
permission, okay?

346
03:49:54,460 --> 03:49:56,780
This is not a fancy
dress party, okay.

347
03:49:56,820 --> 03:49:57,940
I know that but...

348
03:49:57,980 --> 03:49:59,700
...I have to put on a show.
Now go.

349
03:49:59,740 --> 03:50:03,060
Are you a wicked witch
from a Disney movie?

350
03:50:03,100 --> 03:50:04,220
What?

351
03:50:04,260 --> 03:50:05,900
Sing a song.
Wicked witch song.

352
03:50:05,940 --> 03:50:07,300
Not now. Later. Okay?
Now go.

353
03:50:07,340 --> 03:50:09,460
Sing.
Or I'll call Mom and Dad.

354
03:50:11,700 --> 03:50:12,660
Come here, Jeh.

355
03:50:12,700 --> 03:50:14,340
I think someone's stuck.

356
03:50:14,380 --> 03:50:15,780
I think it's Homai.

357
03:50:15,820 --> 03:50:17,980
She falls now and then.

358
03:50:20,540 --> 03:50:21,580
Homai aunty...

359
03:50:23,500 --> 03:50:24,420
Are you there?

360
03:50:25,620 --> 03:50:26,740
I'll just get the key.

361
03:50:27,620 --> 03:50:28,860
Homai...

362
03:50:28,900 --> 03:50:32,300
"I'm a witch
or I'm an angel..."

363
03:50:32,340 --> 03:50:36,260
"Gonna get you,
gonna get you anyway..."

364
03:50:36,300 --> 03:50:39,660
"I'm a witch
or I'm an angel..."

365
03:50:39,700 --> 03:50:41,860
"Gonna get you,
gonna get you..."

366
03:50:43,100 --> 03:50:48,500
Once more! Once more!

367
03:50:50,940 --> 03:50:51,660
Damini...

368
03:50:51,700 --> 03:50:53,100
Seventy eight...

369
03:50:53,140 --> 03:50:54,460
Seventy nine...

370
03:50:54,500 --> 03:50:55,580
Eighty...

371
03:50:55,620 --> 03:50:56,820
I'm stuck.

372
03:50:58,940 --> 03:51:00,140
I'm stuck, Jeh.

373
03:51:02,780 --> 03:51:03,820
They fired me.

374
03:51:07,100 --> 03:51:09,980
They fucking fired me
from my own company.

375
03:51:11,500 --> 03:51:12,500
It's okay.

376
03:51:13,700 --> 03:51:14,780
It's okay.

377
03:51:16,060 --> 03:51:17,180
Take your time.

378
03:51:18,140 --> 03:51:20,060
I think I'm frozen.

379
03:51:23,380 --> 03:51:25,820
I just have to finish counting
the number of...

380
03:51:25,860 --> 03:51:28,060
...tiles on the floor.

381
03:51:28,100 --> 03:51:29,540
Ya, these...

382
03:51:29,580 --> 03:51:32,140
...tiles are pretty interesting,
aren't they?

383
03:51:34,260 --> 03:51:36,780
And anyway, there's
nothing super exciting
happening outside.

384
03:51:36,820 --> 03:51:38,180
Except that my...

385
03:51:38,220 --> 03:51:39,740
...half Goan, half Parsi...

386
03:51:39,780 --> 03:51:43,020
...fully mad family
is hitting peak madness.

387
03:51:43,100 --> 03:51:45,340
Melvin uncle just touched
Diana aunty's ass.

388
03:51:47,620 --> 03:51:49,700
You made me forget
my count.

389
03:51:49,740 --> 03:51:50,700
That's okay.

390
03:51:50,740 --> 03:51:51,780
Let's start from the beginning.

391
03:51:51,780 --> 03:51:53,260
We have all the time
in the world.

392
03:51:56,780 --> 03:51:57,780
Okay.

393
03:52:05,020 --> 03:52:06,740
C'mon, I'll count with you.

394
03:52:06,780 --> 03:52:08,020
Okay.

395
03:52:08,020 --> 03:52:09,180
Start from the...

396
03:52:10,180 --> 03:52:11,220
...right top corner?

397
03:52:12,500 --> 03:52:13,380
One...

398
03:52:14,380 --> 03:52:16,100
Two...
-Two...

399
03:52:16,140 --> 03:52:16,740
Three...
-Three...

400
03:52:17,780 --> 03:52:19,340
Four...
-Four...

401
03:52:19,380 --> 03:52:20,380
Five...
-Five...

402
03:52:20,420 --> 03:52:21,780
Six...
-Six...

403
03:52:21,860 --> 03:52:22,980
Seven...
-Seven...

404
03:52:23,020 --> 03:52:24,220
Eight...

405
03:52:24,260 --> 03:52:25,980
Nine...

406
03:52:26,020 --> 03:52:29,500
"Gonna get you,
gonna get you..."

407
03:52:40,020 --> 03:52:41,260
Fuck you.

408
03:52:47,180 --> 03:52:49,700
I'm going to fucking
sue their pants off.

409
03:52:49,740 --> 03:52:52,020
The whole fucking board,
you watch.

410
03:52:52,020 --> 03:52:53,260
It's okay, Anj.

411
03:52:55,260 --> 03:52:56,660
It was anyway time.

412
03:52:56,700 --> 03:52:58,940
They were making it
impossible for me.

413
03:52:58,980 --> 03:53:00,100
So, now what?

414
03:53:00,140 --> 03:53:01,700
No freaking clue!

415
03:53:03,500 --> 03:53:05,260
It's like being twenty one
again, you know.

416
03:53:07,900 --> 03:53:09,460
Where are the years going?

417
03:53:09,500 --> 03:53:11,900
It's like I was
twenty one yesterday.

418
03:53:11,940 --> 03:53:13,740
I was. Twenty one.

419
03:53:13,780 --> 03:53:15,180
Like almost yesterday.

420
03:53:15,220 --> 03:53:18,020
Shut up, Ms Baby Patel.

421
03:53:18,020 --> 03:53:20,140
Twenty one was awful, guys.

422
03:53:20,180 --> 03:53:22,780
Final year of LLB at NLS.

423
03:53:22,860 --> 03:53:24,980
No idea how to talk to boys.

424
03:53:25,020 --> 03:53:28,260
And the worst
fashion sense ever!

425
03:53:29,780 --> 03:53:31,260
Hey, you guys know
those lists...

426
03:53:31,260 --> 03:53:32,900
...with thirty things to do
before you're thirty?

427
03:53:32,940 --> 03:53:34,020
Oh, my God.
-Oh, God!

428
03:53:34,100 --> 03:53:35,380
I used to read all of them.

429
03:53:35,420 --> 03:53:37,500
Who makes these lists?

430
03:53:37,500 --> 03:53:38,460
Who are these people?

431
03:53:38,500 --> 03:53:39,700
Seriously, man.

432
03:53:39,740 --> 03:53:42,020
This Manali to Leh
solo bike trip.

433
03:53:42,020 --> 03:53:43,460
Go to a Buddhist monastery...

434
03:53:43,500 --> 03:53:45,420
...and make noodle soup
with the lamas.

435
03:53:48,220 --> 03:53:50,660
Quit your job, go to Goa
and sell beaded necklaces.

436
03:53:50,700 --> 03:53:52,460
And party.
-Ya...

437
03:53:52,500 --> 03:53:53,940
Sky dive.

438
03:53:53,980 --> 03:53:56,500
Confront life and death.

439
03:53:56,500 --> 03:53:58,460
Which I do every day...

440
03:53:58,500 --> 03:54:00,620
...while crossing
traffic on Peddar Road.

441
03:54:01,780 --> 03:54:02,860
Hey! Guys...

442
03:54:02,900 --> 03:54:05,020
One really good one.

443
03:54:05,020 --> 03:54:06,660
Sex in the rainforest with...

444
03:54:06,700 --> 03:54:08,420
...creatures crawling up
your bottom.

445
03:54:08,460 --> 03:54:10,100
Or maybe in an airplane loo...

446
03:54:10,140 --> 03:54:12,460
...with the tap up your butt!

447
03:54:12,500 --> 03:54:14,020
I've never gone for a trek.

448
03:54:14,020 --> 03:54:15,260
Or had sex.

449
03:54:16,740 --> 03:54:20,260
I mean, not in a rainforest
or an airplane.

450
03:54:20,340 --> 03:54:22,900
Sids, did you just
forget that you had sex?

451
03:54:28,780 --> 03:54:29,620
Girls!

452
03:54:30,980 --> 03:54:32,220
We've been looking for
you everywhere.

453
03:54:32,260 --> 03:54:33,260
Awww...

454
03:54:33,340 --> 03:54:34,580
Looking for your mommy?

455
03:54:34,620 --> 03:54:35,940
Diaper change?

456
03:54:35,980 --> 03:54:37,620
Need a spanking?

457
03:54:38,340 --> 03:54:39,180
Wow.

458
03:54:39,220 --> 03:54:40,180
These girls are mean,
aren't they?

459
03:54:40,220 --> 03:54:42,460
Just bad alcohol behaviour.

460
03:54:42,500 --> 03:54:43,260
Hey...

461
03:54:43,260 --> 03:54:44,740
Why is your nose so crooked?

462
03:54:44,780 --> 03:54:46,420
Why are you such a grouch?

463
03:54:46,460 --> 03:54:47,460
Need a spanking?

464
03:54:48,740 --> 03:54:50,260
Damini, don't you
want to cut your cake?

465
03:54:50,340 --> 03:54:51,260
Oh, yeah!

466
03:54:51,260 --> 03:54:55,580
Cake! Cake!
-Cake! Cake!

467
03:55:18,340 --> 03:55:20,980
How long have you been
married for?

468
03:55:21,020 --> 03:55:22,260
Fifty nine years.

469
03:55:22,260 --> 03:55:23,380
Wow! That's...

470
03:55:23,420 --> 03:55:25,340
And it's been bliss.

471
03:55:25,380 --> 03:55:27,660
Ya?
-We have such fun together.

472
03:55:27,700 --> 03:55:29,340
Like I'll say to him,

473
03:55:29,380 --> 03:55:31,580
'Move over, fatso.'

474
03:55:31,620 --> 03:55:34,460
And he'll say, 'Okay, flatso.'

475
03:55:34,500 --> 03:55:35,380
Why does he call you 'flatso'?

476
03:55:35,420 --> 03:55:37,140
Because I'm flat.

477
03:55:37,180 --> 03:55:38,780
I don't have a big bosom.

478
03:55:38,860 --> 03:55:39,780
Okay.

479
03:55:47,460 --> 03:55:48,780
Hi, baby!

480
03:55:48,780 --> 03:55:51,900
Mama, we went to
Bandra flea market.

481
03:55:51,940 --> 03:55:53,780
Wow! Flea market!

482
03:55:53,860 --> 03:55:55,940
But there was no flea.

483
03:55:55,980 --> 03:55:58,020
Only mosquitos.

484
03:55:58,020 --> 03:56:00,020
One bit me also.

485
03:56:00,020 --> 03:56:02,140
My arm was red, red.

486
03:56:02,180 --> 03:56:03,660
Oh, sorry...

487
03:56:03,700 --> 03:56:06,260
Kavya aunty put cream,

488
03:56:06,260 --> 03:56:07,500
now it's better.

489
03:56:07,500 --> 03:56:08,740
Hi, Arya...

490
03:56:08,780 --> 03:56:09,580
Hi!

491
03:56:09,620 --> 03:56:11,660
Mama, who's that?

492
03:56:11,700 --> 03:56:13,500
Baby, I'm going to
speak to you later, okay?

493
03:56:13,500 --> 03:56:14,860
Bye! Love you!

494
03:56:16,780 --> 03:56:18,420
Sorry, I...

495
03:56:18,460 --> 03:56:20,220
I should've asked...
-Never...

496
03:56:20,260 --> 03:56:21,260
...do that again.

497
03:56:40,340 --> 03:56:41,900
Hello, Ms Usain Bolt.

498
03:56:43,500 --> 03:56:45,380
What happened?

499
03:56:45,420 --> 03:56:46,540
Got tired of running?

500
03:56:49,300 --> 03:56:50,420
Look...

501
03:56:50,460 --> 03:56:51,820
I...

502
03:56:51,860 --> 03:56:54,900
...really, really like you,
Siddi-Piddi.

503
03:56:54,940 --> 03:56:57,500
And I want this to go
somewhere meaningful.

504
03:56:59,020 --> 03:57:01,540
I'm just here for two weeks...

505
03:57:01,580 --> 03:57:02,940
...and then I return to
New York.

506
03:57:02,980 --> 03:57:04,580
And then I don't
know when I'll ever...

507
03:57:27,420 --> 03:57:28,500
Wow!

508
03:57:34,900 --> 03:57:36,220
Damini...

509
03:57:36,260 --> 03:57:38,540
You always know
what to do.

510
03:57:38,580 --> 03:57:40,420
Not this time, Mom.

511
03:57:40,460 --> 03:57:43,060
Your prodigal daughter
is clueless.

512
03:57:43,100 --> 03:57:44,420
Are you disappointed?

513
03:57:44,460 --> 03:57:45,460
Damini...

514
03:57:45,500 --> 03:57:47,220
You're a journalist.

515
03:57:47,260 --> 03:57:49,740
With or without
Investigator.com.

516
03:57:49,780 --> 03:57:51,500
They can take away your title...

517
03:57:51,540 --> 03:57:53,700
...but they can never
take away your talent.

518
03:57:55,220 --> 03:57:56,820
Happy birthday, darling.

519
03:57:56,860 --> 03:57:57,940
You know what?

520
03:57:57,980 --> 03:57:59,380
Everything's going to
be alright.

521
03:57:59,420 --> 03:58:01,020
Okay?

522
03:58:01,060 --> 03:58:02,980
Thank you.

523
03:58:03,020 --> 03:58:05,340
Don't worry.

524
03:58:05,380 --> 03:58:06,460
Bye.

525
03:58:18,380 --> 03:58:19,380
Hi...

526
03:58:40,460 --> 03:58:42,580
Bye, Jeh.
-Bye, bye.

527
03:58:42,620 --> 03:58:46,140
Bye, bye.
-Bye!

528
03:58:47,860 --> 03:58:49,420
Thanks for coming.

529
03:58:49,460 --> 03:58:50,420
Next week.

530
03:58:50,460 --> 03:58:51,940
Next stop, Truck Bar.

531
03:58:51,980 --> 03:58:53,340
Come fast.

532
03:58:53,380 --> 03:58:55,660
Guys, don't run.

533
03:58:55,700 --> 03:58:56,940
Wait up, ya!

534
03:59:08,700 --> 03:59:09,660
Good morning.

535
03:59:09,700 --> 03:59:10,940
Good morning, beautiful.

536
03:59:15,580 --> 03:59:17,500
That is a beautiful way
to wake up.

537
03:59:18,500 --> 03:59:19,820
Shall we go for a walk?

538
03:59:19,860 --> 03:59:21,540
We can have breakfast
at a shack.

539
03:59:21,580 --> 03:59:22,340
Walk?

540
03:59:24,980 --> 03:59:27,140
Costume trial in a bit.

541
03:59:27,180 --> 03:59:28,660
So cancel it.

542
03:59:28,700 --> 03:59:30,460
It's my film, Umang.

543
03:59:30,500 --> 03:59:32,220
I can't be a diva.

544
03:59:32,260 --> 03:59:33,300
Then give me five minutes.

545
03:59:33,340 --> 03:59:35,420
I'll get ready and come along.

546
03:59:35,460 --> 03:59:36,380
Or...

547
03:59:37,500 --> 03:59:39,460
You could...

548
03:59:39,500 --> 03:59:40,740
...go to the gym.

549
03:59:40,780 --> 03:59:42,220
I heard it's awesome.

550
03:59:44,380 --> 03:59:46,660
What is the problem?

551
03:59:46,700 --> 03:59:47,700
Don't come to the shoot.

552
03:59:47,740 --> 03:59:48,900
Don't come to the
costume trial.

553
03:59:48,940 --> 03:59:50,180
The other day, at the party,

554
03:59:50,220 --> 03:59:51,580
you introduced me
as your trainer.

555
03:59:54,500 --> 03:59:56,780
Am I an embarrassment to you?

556
03:59:56,820 --> 03:59:59,340
What? Don't be mad.

557
03:59:59,380 --> 04:00:01,220
Then what's the problem?

558
04:00:01,260 --> 04:00:02,860
Look...

559
04:00:02,900 --> 04:00:04,580
I have to keep...

560
04:00:04,620 --> 04:00:05,900
...my personal life private.

561
04:00:05,940 --> 04:00:07,420
You know how the
tabloids are.

562
04:00:07,460 --> 04:00:08,900
When you were with
Raghuveer Singh...

563
04:00:08,940 --> 04:00:11,780
...your personal life
was all over the tabloids.

564
04:00:11,820 --> 04:00:13,140
Umang...

565
04:00:17,100 --> 04:00:18,780
All this...

566
04:00:18,820 --> 04:00:20,380
...is new for me.

567
04:00:20,420 --> 04:00:21,540
Okay?

568
04:00:22,940 --> 04:00:24,180
I can't just...

569
04:00:24,220 --> 04:00:25,340
Can't just what?

570
04:00:25,380 --> 04:00:27,180
I can't just come out of
the closet.

571
04:00:27,220 --> 04:00:29,140
My career will be over.

572
04:00:31,180 --> 04:00:33,780
And I can't go back into
the closet.

573
04:00:33,820 --> 04:00:35,820
I fought against everyone
in Ludhiana,

574
04:00:35,860 --> 04:00:38,940
left behind those I loved,
to make this life for myself.

575
04:00:38,980 --> 04:00:41,460
I value it too damn much.

576
04:00:41,500 --> 04:00:45,700
And I fought really hard
to get exactly where I am.

577
04:00:45,740 --> 04:00:48,740
Too hard to throw it all away,
just like that.

578
04:00:48,780 --> 04:00:50,340
-Just like that?
-Ya.

579
04:00:50,380 --> 04:00:51,740
Just like that?!
-Ya!

580
04:00:54,700 --> 04:00:56,100
This is my first relationship
with a woman.

581
04:00:56,140 --> 04:00:57,780
I'm not even sure if I'm...

582
04:00:57,820 --> 04:01:00,020
If I'm what?

583
04:01:00,060 --> 04:01:01,420
I don't even know if
I want this.

584
04:01:15,580 --> 04:01:17,500
You knew it when you were
fucking me.

585
04:01:31,540 --> 04:01:32,940
Fuck the board.

586
04:01:32,980 --> 04:01:34,580
Welcome back, Damini Rizvi Roy.
