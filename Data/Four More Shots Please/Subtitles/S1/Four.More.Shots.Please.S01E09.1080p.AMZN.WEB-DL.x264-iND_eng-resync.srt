1
04:03:34,520 --> 04:03:37,040
Do we really want
what we think we want?

2
04:03:37,320 --> 04:03:39,400
Or is it only when we get
what we want,

3
04:03:39,600 --> 04:03:42,760
...that we understand if
we want it because we want it
or...

4
04:03:42,840 --> 04:03:45,120
...want it because
we think we want it.

5
04:03:57,280 --> 04:03:59,240
One, two, three, four...

6
04:03:59,280 --> 04:04:01,000
I declare a thumb war.

7
04:04:06,160 --> 04:04:07,480
Yes! I won.

8
04:04:08,160 --> 04:04:09,160
What do you get?

9
04:04:09,280 --> 04:04:10,120
Squat.

10
04:04:11,840 --> 04:04:14,640
By the way, your family driver
is fully shocked.

11
04:04:16,000 --> 04:04:16,920
So?

12
04:04:17,240 --> 04:04:18,200
I don't care.

13
04:04:18,920 --> 04:04:19,800
Do you?

14
04:04:33,200 --> 04:04:34,280
Let's go to the Maldives?
You and me.

15
04:04:34,320 --> 04:04:35,440
The sand. White bikini.

16
04:04:35,480 --> 04:04:36,480
On or off.

17
04:04:37,760 --> 04:04:39,880
Just enjoy the moment.

18
04:04:40,080 --> 04:04:40,920
And...

19
04:04:41,040 --> 04:04:42,960
...I might show you my
white bra.

20
04:04:43,320 --> 04:04:43,960
On.

21
04:04:44,200 --> 04:04:45,080
And off.

22
04:04:45,480 --> 04:04:46,520
Fuck!

23
04:04:47,200 --> 04:04:49,560
Where has this sexy nymph
been hiding all this while?

24
04:04:49,680 --> 04:04:51,840
Took a while to wade
through the traffic.

25
04:04:54,080 --> 04:04:55,480
Sexy and funny.

26
04:04:55,680 --> 04:04:57,680
What else have you been hiding
from me, Ms. Patel?

27
04:06:37,480 --> 04:06:38,360
Leaving?

28
04:06:39,320 --> 04:06:40,040
Ya.

29
04:06:40,400 --> 04:06:41,600
Aren't those the rules?

30
04:06:46,960 --> 04:06:47,800
Stay?

31
04:06:49,640 --> 04:06:51,200
And what about your cocoon?

32
04:06:53,240 --> 04:06:55,200
You can be my cocoon.

33
04:06:57,000 --> 04:06:58,920
Why not. It's been my
childhood ambition.

34
04:06:59,280 --> 04:07:01,080
To be someone's cocoon.

35
04:07:08,640 --> 04:07:09,720
Perfect.

36
04:07:28,880 --> 04:07:29,680
Mom!

37
04:07:30,920 --> 04:07:31,680
Happy Diwali Umi!

38
04:07:31,760 --> 04:07:33,440
Pinky...
-What were you up to?

39
04:07:33,520 --> 04:07:35,120
We've been ringing
the bell for so long.

40
04:07:35,200 --> 04:07:36,320
You've come unannounced.

41
04:07:36,400 --> 04:07:37,760
We wanted to surprise you.

42
04:07:37,880 --> 04:07:38,640
And we wanted to experience...

43
04:07:38,680 --> 04:07:39,960
...Mumbai's famous festival
of lights!

44
04:07:40,040 --> 04:07:40,920
Come...

45
04:07:42,440 --> 04:07:43,600
I got it.

46
04:07:52,400 --> 04:07:53,200
Coffee.

47
04:07:53,560 --> 04:07:54,760
Mr. Workaholic.

48
04:07:55,720 --> 04:07:56,320
Thanks.

49
04:07:57,640 --> 04:07:58,600
Just thanks?

50
04:07:59,040 --> 04:08:00,720
Mehta and Mehta's file
is pending.

51
04:08:01,120 --> 04:08:02,440
Yes but...

52
04:08:02,600 --> 04:08:04,440
...you can take
a two minute break, right?

53
04:08:04,600 --> 04:08:06,160
No, I actually can't.

54
04:08:06,600 --> 04:08:08,080
Because my boss
is a hard-ass.

55
04:08:08,520 --> 04:08:10,120
She never says what
she thinks.

56
04:08:10,400 --> 04:08:12,040
And she doesn't think
about what she says.

57
04:08:13,440 --> 04:08:14,920
That's a bit harsh.

58
04:08:15,280 --> 04:08:16,120
Listen,

59
04:08:16,320 --> 04:08:18,200
can we please
go inside and talk.

60
04:08:18,320 --> 04:08:20,400
Because I have no idea
what's going on here.

61
04:08:20,520 --> 04:08:22,120
Ya well...I don't either.

62
04:08:22,400 --> 04:08:23,880
So let's go inside and talk.

63
04:08:24,040 --> 04:08:24,840
Please.

64
04:08:26,880 --> 04:08:27,760
Please Arjun.

65
04:08:30,840 --> 04:08:32,040
I am not your puppy.

66
04:08:32,440 --> 04:08:33,560
You can't pet me
when you like...

67
04:08:33,600 --> 04:08:35,320
...and then send me off to
a kennel when you don't.

68
04:08:35,560 --> 04:08:36,920
Just because
I'm younger than you...

69
04:08:36,960 --> 04:08:39,000
...does not mean that
I don't have feelings.

70
04:08:39,840 --> 04:08:41,920
God, Arjun...
-First, you yell at me in Goa.

71
04:08:41,960 --> 04:08:44,000
Then you ignore me for
three days. And now...

72
04:08:44,600 --> 04:08:45,200
coffee!

73
04:08:45,520 --> 04:08:46,560
Seriously?

74
04:08:47,280 --> 04:08:48,920
Arjun, this is not easy
for me.

75
04:08:50,040 --> 04:08:50,920
I have a daughter.

76
04:08:50,960 --> 04:08:52,000
I have responsibilities.

77
04:08:52,040 --> 04:08:53,400
Yes, you don't think
I know that?

78
04:08:53,920 --> 04:08:54,640
Look...

79
04:08:55,400 --> 04:08:56,200
I like you.

80
04:08:56,840 --> 04:08:58,920
I genuinely like you, okay.

81
04:08:59,120 --> 04:09:01,520
I want to be a part of
your life.

82
04:09:01,880 --> 04:09:03,840
Not to be some dirty
secret that you hide away.

83
04:09:03,920 --> 04:09:04,960
I never said that.

84
04:09:05,080 --> 04:09:07,120
Please. You behave like
you're embarrassed of me.

85
04:09:07,200 --> 04:09:08,680
Not to be seen in
public with me.

86
04:09:08,760 --> 04:09:09,560
But guess what,

87
04:09:09,640 --> 04:09:10,680
I'm not a toy boy.

88
04:09:13,280 --> 04:09:14,040
Arjun.

89
04:09:16,080 --> 04:09:19,080
Arjun, I'm really sorry
if I made you feel that way.

90
04:09:19,240 --> 04:09:20,960
Honestly, that was not
my intention.

91
04:09:22,120 --> 04:09:22,760
Listen,

92
04:09:23,280 --> 04:09:23,960
I...

93
04:09:24,200 --> 04:09:25,760
...really like you too.

94
04:09:26,320 --> 04:09:27,600
But it's just that...

95
04:09:28,000 --> 04:09:29,960
I'm very sensitive
about Arya.

96
04:09:30,480 --> 04:09:31,080
You know and...

97
04:09:31,120 --> 04:09:33,560
I have my own shit going on
with this whole...

98
04:09:33,720 --> 04:09:34,720
...mommy guilt.

99
04:09:34,840 --> 04:09:37,080
My own misplaced
insecurities. It's...

100
04:09:40,120 --> 04:09:41,160
You won't understand.

101
04:09:41,560 --> 04:09:43,400
You're going to decide
that for me as well?

102
04:09:49,680 --> 04:09:50,400
Okay.

103
04:09:50,960 --> 04:09:51,480
Dinner.

104
04:09:51,600 --> 04:09:52,480
Tonight.

105
04:09:52,960 --> 04:09:54,920
With Arya and me?

106
04:09:55,920 --> 04:09:58,160
Please. Please.

107
04:09:58,520 --> 04:09:59,240
Please. Please.

108
04:09:59,320 --> 04:10:01,600
Are you sure?
-Yes, very sure.

109
04:10:03,520 --> 04:10:05,080
Okay, I think I'd like that.

110
04:10:05,360 --> 04:10:06,480
Okay.

111
04:10:07,160 --> 04:10:08,560
And now you get back
to work...

112
04:10:08,640 --> 04:10:10,760
...before your hard-ass boss...

113
04:10:10,800 --> 04:10:12,240
...catches you bunking work.

114
04:10:15,440 --> 04:10:16,720
Yes, Ms. Menon.

115
04:10:34,600 --> 04:10:36,160
Morning, viral sensation.

116
04:10:36,720 --> 04:10:37,720
Viral?

117
04:10:38,320 --> 04:10:40,520
Like your article on the
troll cells?

118
04:10:40,760 --> 04:10:41,800
It's gone viral.

119
04:10:42,720 --> 04:10:43,600
What?

120
04:10:46,760 --> 04:10:47,520
Yes!

121
04:10:48,800 --> 04:10:51,320
30,000 shares?
-Yes.

122
04:10:53,480 --> 04:10:54,680
Where's my phone?

123
04:10:58,880 --> 04:11:00,840
7,000 retweets.

124
04:11:02,920 --> 04:11:05,920
9,400 mentions on Twitter.

125
04:11:07,200 --> 04:11:09,640
Oh my God!

126
04:11:11,400 --> 04:11:13,160
You trolled the trolls!

127
04:11:14,040 --> 04:11:15,720
I have to call Vaibhav and...

128
04:11:15,960 --> 04:11:16,760
Karan and that...

129
04:11:17,000 --> 04:11:17,920
...crazy Asha.

130
04:11:18,120 --> 04:11:20,000
They'll be fucking
jumping in joy!

131
04:11:29,520 --> 04:11:30,680
Damini, according to
your story,

132
04:11:30,720 --> 04:11:33,240
there is a powerful
person behind all this.

133
04:11:33,360 --> 04:11:34,960
Largely, trolls...

134
04:11:35,200 --> 04:11:35,800
...have paid jobs.

135
04:11:35,840 --> 04:11:37,680
They hide behind their
anonymity and...

136
04:11:37,720 --> 04:11:39,240
...spew venom on whoever
they are told to.

137
04:11:39,280 --> 04:11:41,760
In this case,
the main culprit is...

138
04:11:41,880 --> 04:11:42,680
...the big guy.

139
04:11:43,240 --> 04:11:44,480
Top industrialist Badani.

140
04:11:44,560 --> 04:11:46,920
In order to save his
politician friends and...

141
04:11:47,000 --> 04:11:49,000
...secure his business
interests,

142
04:11:49,040 --> 04:11:49,920
he runs these troll cells.

143
04:11:50,120 --> 04:11:52,200
Don't you think these
trolls will retaliate?

144
04:11:52,360 --> 04:11:53,520
Take their revenge on you?

145
04:11:55,200 --> 04:11:57,400
These people won't even
show their faces.

146
04:11:57,560 --> 04:11:58,480
Why would I fear them?

147
04:12:05,960 --> 04:12:06,480
Good evening, Ma'am.

148
04:12:06,560 --> 04:12:07,720
Good evening.
-Good evening.

149
04:12:09,360 --> 04:12:10,040
Stop it.

150
04:12:10,120 --> 04:12:10,720
What?

151
04:12:20,440 --> 04:12:21,480
I bought wine...

152
04:12:21,560 --> 04:12:22,400
...which...

153
04:12:33,040 --> 04:12:33,840
Hey!

154
04:12:34,040 --> 04:12:35,000
Hi.

155
04:12:35,680 --> 04:12:36,680
I thought...

156
04:12:36,760 --> 04:12:38,680
...you two were coming
over tomorrow for the...

157
04:12:39,120 --> 04:12:39,920
...festival thing.

158
04:12:39,920 --> 04:12:40,920
No...

159
04:12:41,600 --> 04:12:42,160
It was...it was...

160
04:12:42,280 --> 04:12:43,280
...it was today.
-Today. Today.

161
04:12:43,360 --> 04:12:43,920
Ya.

162
04:12:44,000 --> 04:12:44,880
Oh...

163
04:12:45,120 --> 04:12:46,040
Ya. Of course.

164
04:12:46,440 --> 04:12:47,760
Of course, I remember.

165
04:12:48,160 --> 04:12:48,920
Of course.

166
04:12:49,280 --> 04:12:50,160
Should we?

167
04:12:50,800 --> 04:12:51,640
Of course!

168
04:12:51,680 --> 04:12:52,800
Ya, please.

169
04:13:08,280 --> 04:13:09,240
Hi, I'm...

170
04:13:09,280 --> 04:13:10,560
I'm Kavya, by the way.

171
04:13:10,680 --> 04:13:11,400
Arjun.

172
04:13:13,280 --> 04:13:14,240
That's Varun.

173
04:13:16,120 --> 04:13:17,000
Arya's dad.

174
04:13:17,040 --> 04:13:17,800
Ya.

175
04:13:18,880 --> 04:13:20,440
Arjun and I...

176
04:13:20,480 --> 04:13:21,240
...work together.

177
04:13:21,280 --> 04:13:22,880
Oh.
-Nice.

178
04:13:24,520 --> 04:13:25,280
You look...

179
04:13:25,360 --> 04:13:26,800
...fairly young to be a lawyer.

180
04:13:27,520 --> 04:13:29,040
Oh no, just an intern.

181
04:13:29,160 --> 04:13:30,280
Intern?
-Ya.

182
04:13:32,480 --> 04:13:34,640
I'd be careful if I was you,
you know.

183
04:13:35,000 --> 04:13:36,160
These buildings...

184
04:13:37,160 --> 04:13:38,520
They're not very
comfortable with...

185
04:13:38,560 --> 04:13:39,800
...uncultured behavior.

186
04:13:39,920 --> 04:13:40,680
So...

187
04:13:40,800 --> 04:13:42,880
CCTV cameras so...

188
04:13:42,920 --> 04:13:44,280
...you don't know
who's watching.

189
04:13:55,880 --> 04:13:57,040
Please, go ahead.
-No.

190
04:13:57,040 --> 04:13:57,720
After you.

191
04:13:57,800 --> 04:13:59,000
No, you first.

192
04:14:00,040 --> 04:14:00,800
Bro...

193
04:14:01,440 --> 04:14:02,720
I was the first one.

194
04:14:04,240 --> 04:14:05,280
You go first.

195
04:14:05,560 --> 04:14:06,280
Okay.

196
04:14:13,920 --> 04:14:15,160
So what is this?

197
04:14:15,520 --> 04:14:16,600
Reliving your youth?

198
04:14:17,680 --> 04:14:19,400
Actually, living it for the
first time.

199
04:14:19,560 --> 04:14:21,120
Does HR know about this?

200
04:14:23,680 --> 04:14:25,680
I'm in it just for the sex.

201
04:14:27,400 --> 04:14:28,280
Wow.

202
04:14:28,760 --> 04:14:30,400
You should be a
stand-up comedian.

203
04:14:32,440 --> 04:14:34,680
Well, after our divorce,
you now know that...

204
04:14:34,720 --> 04:14:35,720
...I'm funny too.

205
04:14:38,040 --> 04:14:39,080
See what I mean.

206
04:14:39,400 --> 04:14:40,040
Very funny.

207
04:14:40,160 --> 04:14:41,240
Very funny.

208
04:14:42,240 --> 04:14:44,440
Let's join these two.
Put this one here.

209
04:14:46,920 --> 04:14:48,240
Put blue here.

210
04:14:48,320 --> 04:14:49,040
Okay...

211
04:14:49,120 --> 04:14:50,120
Miss Bossy Pants.

212
04:14:50,160 --> 04:14:50,760
Blue.

213
04:14:50,800 --> 04:14:52,320
Just like her mother.
-Ya?

214
04:14:52,480 --> 04:14:55,240
Dadda says Pookie Aunty
bossy pants.

215
04:14:56,000 --> 04:14:58,160
Pookie Aunty bossy pants?

216
04:14:58,200 --> 04:15:00,520
Pookie Aunty.
-Pookie Aunty bossy pants!

217
04:15:04,880 --> 04:15:06,320
Before introducing him
to Arya,

218
04:15:06,360 --> 04:15:08,120
couldn't you have waited
a few days?

219
04:15:08,480 --> 04:15:09,440
Like you did?

220
04:15:09,640 --> 04:15:10,680
Ya, like I did.

221
04:15:10,960 --> 04:15:12,040
Six months.

222
04:15:12,320 --> 04:15:14,240
Only after that did
I introduce Kayva to her.

223
04:15:15,000 --> 04:15:17,440
Everybody can't be
as perfect as you are.

224
04:15:18,080 --> 04:15:20,160
Mr. Tighty-Whitey
Varun Khanna.

225
04:15:20,240 --> 04:15:21,560
I wear boxers now.

226
04:15:22,160 --> 04:15:23,600
Airing yourself out?

227
04:15:24,400 --> 04:15:26,080
Does Kavya want a baby?

228
04:15:26,440 --> 04:15:27,160
Maybe.

229
04:15:28,200 --> 04:15:30,040
See that's the difference now.

230
04:15:30,800 --> 04:15:33,240
Kavya would like to
have a child.

231
04:15:34,280 --> 04:15:36,040
And you would like to
date one.

232
04:15:38,160 --> 04:15:39,360
That's really below the belt.

233
04:15:39,440 --> 04:15:41,800
Babe, everything is
below the belt.

234
04:15:42,960 --> 04:15:43,680
What?

235
04:15:43,760 --> 04:15:45,880
You guys started drinking
without us?

236
04:15:46,600 --> 04:15:47,440
Sorry...
-So sorry...

237
04:15:47,520 --> 04:15:48,680
C'mon.

238
04:15:51,200 --> 04:15:51,920
Okay.

239
04:16:08,000 --> 04:16:09,680
Why are you behaving
like this?

240
04:16:10,840 --> 04:16:11,720
Like what?

241
04:16:12,000 --> 04:16:13,600
Like you're...

242
04:16:13,960 --> 04:16:15,080
...jealous or something.

243
04:16:15,400 --> 04:16:16,600
Jealous?

244
04:16:18,240 --> 04:16:19,120
No.

245
04:16:19,760 --> 04:16:20,720
Don't be ridiculous.

246
04:16:20,800 --> 04:16:22,320
Hey guys! Who wants
some pizza?

247
04:16:22,880 --> 04:16:23,800
Me! Me!

248
04:16:23,880 --> 04:16:25,360
Pizza! Pizza!
-Pizza! Pizza!

249
04:16:25,440 --> 04:16:26,520
Pizza! Pizza!
-I'll be up for some pizza.

250
04:16:26,560 --> 04:16:28,520
Pizza! Pizza!
-Pizza! Pizza!

251
04:16:42,840 --> 04:16:43,880
Hey Damini!

252
04:16:50,760 --> 04:16:51,720
Dr. War...

253
04:16:51,840 --> 04:16:52,680
Aamir...
-Ya.

254
04:16:52,720 --> 04:16:53,480
Hi...

255
04:16:56,560 --> 04:16:57,600
Been busy?

256
04:16:58,120 --> 04:17:00,400
No replies to my texts,
my calls.

257
04:17:00,800 --> 04:17:02,240
My birthday wishes.

258
04:17:02,360 --> 04:17:04,200
I was in Goa for my
birthday and...

259
04:17:04,240 --> 04:17:05,160
...my phone wasn't working.

260
04:17:05,200 --> 04:17:06,040
Sorry.

261
04:17:06,160 --> 04:17:08,200
Also been really swamped
with work...

262
04:17:08,240 --> 04:17:09,240
...ever since I got back so...

263
04:17:09,440 --> 04:17:11,640
Being swamped with
work is the best way to be.

264
04:17:12,160 --> 04:17:13,360
But you look like you
need a drink.

265
04:17:13,440 --> 04:17:14,160
Can I...

266
04:17:14,400 --> 04:17:14,840
...offer you one?

267
04:17:14,920 --> 04:17:16,560
No, no...I'm fine.
-C'mon.

268
04:17:16,640 --> 04:17:18,280
I've been meaning to go
in for the longest time.

269
04:17:18,320 --> 04:17:19,080
But I'm okay...

270
04:17:19,120 --> 04:17:19,800
Really, I'm fine...
-C'mon!

271
04:17:19,960 --> 04:17:21,400
C'mon, one drink.
-It's...okay...

272
04:17:21,480 --> 04:17:22,800
It's fine, c'mon.
-I...

273
04:17:23,880 --> 04:17:25,000
Anything else?

274
04:17:25,520 --> 04:17:26,640
No, thank you.

275
04:17:27,040 --> 04:17:27,800
Dee?

276
04:17:28,440 --> 04:17:29,080
Dee?

277
04:17:29,280 --> 04:17:29,880
Dee?

278
04:17:30,280 --> 04:17:32,280
Yes, your friends call you
Dee, right?

279
04:17:32,440 --> 04:17:33,800
Ms. Rizvi Roy.

280
04:17:38,760 --> 04:17:40,800
Actually, I'm quite a regular
at this bar.

281
04:17:41,120 --> 04:17:42,200
Me and my friends.

282
04:17:42,440 --> 04:17:43,440
Not that I'm an alcoholic.

283
04:17:44,160 --> 04:17:46,080
We're here a couple of
times a week.

284
04:17:46,280 --> 04:17:47,760
Which means I will
have to...

285
04:17:48,080 --> 04:17:49,040
...become a regular here.

286
04:17:50,640 --> 04:17:51,560
Sorry?

287
04:17:51,840 --> 04:17:53,760
From the clinic to the cafe...

288
04:17:54,120 --> 04:17:55,680
...to the bar around the corner.

289
04:17:56,680 --> 04:17:58,080
Here's to us...

290
04:17:59,240 --> 04:18:00,360
...becoming regulars.

291
04:18:08,880 --> 04:18:09,840
Quit smoking.

292
04:18:10,960 --> 04:18:12,560
It's wreaking havoc on
your body.

293
04:18:15,360 --> 04:18:16,400
Cheater.

294
04:18:17,360 --> 04:18:19,280
You're stubbing a
finished cigarette.

295
04:18:22,720 --> 04:18:23,720
Aamir...

296
04:18:27,440 --> 04:18:28,240
Oh my God.

297
04:18:28,280 --> 04:18:29,280
I'm sorry, I just...

298
04:18:29,440 --> 04:18:30,680
Just needed some stock.

299
04:18:32,560 --> 04:18:33,320
Jeh!

300
04:18:37,920 --> 04:18:39,480
You're with that boy?

301
04:18:39,920 --> 04:18:41,520
No, no, nothing like
that. I mean...

302
04:18:41,600 --> 04:18:43,200
...not that we're not
together. I mean...

303
04:18:43,280 --> 04:18:45,640
We weren't together
when you and I were...

304
04:18:45,800 --> 04:18:46,960
I don't know what I'm up to.

305
04:18:47,040 --> 04:18:48,080
What he's up to.

306
04:18:48,360 --> 04:18:49,360
Or what we're up to.

307
04:18:49,480 --> 04:18:51,280
You're so hot and...

308
04:18:51,360 --> 04:18:52,440
I was low and...

309
04:18:52,880 --> 04:18:53,840
...you were there
and I was there...

310
04:18:53,920 --> 04:18:56,360
Do you always ramble like
this with everyone or...

311
04:18:56,840 --> 04:18:57,760
...am I special?

312
04:18:59,480 --> 04:19:00,880
Aamir, I'm really sorry.

313
04:19:03,720 --> 04:19:04,440
It's okay.

314
04:19:08,560 --> 04:19:10,160
Don't forget to come
by for your check-up.

315
04:19:15,200 --> 04:19:16,640
Fuck!

316
04:19:20,320 --> 04:19:21,000
Jeh...

317
04:19:21,720 --> 04:19:22,960
Hey, your friend left.

318
04:19:23,480 --> 04:19:24,920
I wanted to explain.

319
04:19:25,160 --> 04:19:26,720
Explain what Damini?

320
04:19:27,480 --> 04:19:28,760
About what happened.

321
04:19:29,400 --> 04:19:30,560
And what happened.

322
04:19:30,640 --> 04:19:32,280
What you saw?

323
04:19:33,520 --> 04:19:34,600
You don't have to.

324
04:19:34,800 --> 04:19:35,760
Don't worry about it.

325
04:19:36,480 --> 04:19:37,440
He's my doctor.

326
04:19:38,680 --> 04:19:40,080
He's quite the friendly doctor,
isn't he?

327
04:19:40,120 --> 04:19:41,240
As in, my gynac.

328
04:19:41,440 --> 04:19:42,960
As in, he was my gynac.

329
04:19:43,680 --> 04:19:45,280
God, it's all coming out
so wrong.

330
04:19:45,320 --> 04:19:46,080
Yes it is.

331
04:19:47,360 --> 04:19:48,880
There is nothing between us.

332
04:19:49,840 --> 04:19:51,520
Why are you explaining
yourself?

333
04:19:51,600 --> 04:19:53,120
It's not like we're dating,
are we?

334
04:19:53,440 --> 04:19:54,160
Jeh...

335
04:19:54,560 --> 04:19:55,280
Listen to me.

336
04:19:56,000 --> 04:19:57,160
Hey, hey, hey...

337
04:19:58,480 --> 04:19:59,680
Just chill, it's cool.

338
04:19:59,800 --> 04:20:00,800
Really, okay?

339
04:20:11,120 --> 04:20:13,120
Umang, this city is
really nice.

340
04:20:13,200 --> 04:20:14,640
I really like it here.

341
04:20:16,720 --> 04:20:18,160
Mangoes out of season?

342
04:20:18,240 --> 04:20:19,400
And that too Alphonso?

343
04:20:19,680 --> 04:20:20,960
Let me take a look.

344
04:20:22,440 --> 04:20:24,840
You said Mumbai really
suits you?

345
04:20:25,040 --> 04:20:26,120
It does. Why?

346
04:20:26,560 --> 04:20:27,840
Then why do you look
so low?

347
04:20:28,080 --> 04:20:29,120
Are you crazy?

348
04:20:31,720 --> 04:20:32,560
Forget it.

349
04:20:32,640 --> 04:20:35,040
I've got lots of sweets for
Siddhi's mother.

350
04:20:35,240 --> 04:20:36,440
She will really like that.

351
04:20:36,520 --> 04:20:37,200
Should I buy some vegetables?
There isn't much at home.

352
04:20:37,240 --> 04:20:38,480
Should I buy some vegetables?
There isn't much at home.

353
04:20:40,640 --> 04:20:42,040
Aren't you going
to ask me how I've been?

354
04:20:42,120 --> 04:20:43,320
Why don't you tell me.

355
04:20:44,200 --> 04:20:47,120
Your brother and mother
want me to have a baby now.

356
04:20:47,920 --> 04:20:49,200
I'm taking the pill.

357
04:20:49,400 --> 04:20:50,400
Why?

358
04:20:51,720 --> 04:20:53,120
I'm not ready Umi.

359
04:20:55,200 --> 04:20:56,960
Why don't you just tell
them that?

360
04:20:58,120 --> 04:21:00,440
Maybe I was never ready
for marriage.

361
04:21:01,320 --> 04:21:03,680
And you're saying this three
years after getting married.

362
04:21:04,640 --> 04:21:06,960
Not all of us have
the kind of clarity you do.

363
04:21:08,160 --> 04:21:09,800
What do you really want?

364
04:21:10,080 --> 04:21:11,200
To live here.

365
04:21:11,600 --> 04:21:12,600
With you.

366
04:21:13,800 --> 04:21:14,600
Pinky,

367
04:21:15,200 --> 04:21:18,440
I've bought fresh
vegetables for you.

368
04:21:18,480 --> 04:21:20,120
I'll make some juice for you.

369
04:21:20,360 --> 04:21:23,040
Your periods will regularize.

370
04:21:23,720 --> 04:21:26,680
And then we'll have
good news very soon.

371
04:21:34,720 --> 04:21:36,400
I ordered orchids.

372
04:21:36,480 --> 04:21:38,960
What kind of florist doesn't
know the difference between...

373
04:21:39,040 --> 04:21:41,640
...lilies and carnations
and orchids?

374
04:21:43,960 --> 04:21:44,800
Wow!

375
04:21:46,360 --> 04:21:48,040
Siddhi, you're glowing.

376
04:21:48,320 --> 04:21:49,680
Did you get the gold facial?

377
04:21:49,720 --> 04:21:51,600
No Sne...mama.

378
04:21:52,040 --> 04:21:55,080
And you've used the new
foundation I left for you.

379
04:21:55,360 --> 04:21:56,480
Gorgeous.

380
04:21:56,880 --> 04:21:59,560
You know you're
actually a very pretty girl.

381
04:21:59,680 --> 04:22:00,720
Thank you.

382
04:22:01,160 --> 04:22:02,200
I've taken after my mother.

383
04:22:02,280 --> 04:22:03,120
That is true.

384
04:22:03,280 --> 04:22:05,400
Now please,
keep up this perfection.

385
04:22:05,440 --> 04:22:06,560
Don't mess it up.

386
04:22:06,680 --> 04:22:07,960
I'll get changed quickly.

387
04:22:08,080 --> 04:22:10,320
If our guests arrive,
please look after them.

388
04:22:10,480 --> 04:22:12,640
Shyamprasad! Where are
the decorations?

389
04:22:27,880 --> 04:22:30,040
Damini, we miss you so much.

390
04:22:30,200 --> 04:22:31,680
And we're so sorry.

391
04:22:31,840 --> 04:22:32,720
We're wimps.

392
04:22:32,920 --> 04:22:34,080
And traitors.

393
04:22:34,440 --> 04:22:35,600
Please don't be silly.

394
04:22:35,720 --> 04:22:37,080
Without your hardwork
and research,

395
04:22:37,120 --> 04:22:38,320
this article wouldn't have
been possible.

396
04:22:38,400 --> 04:22:39,200
So...

397
04:22:39,400 --> 04:22:41,200
Congratulations to all of us.

398
04:22:41,280 --> 04:22:42,480
Thank you. How sweet.

399
04:22:43,680 --> 04:22:44,720
And...

400
04:22:44,720 --> 04:22:45,680
This is for you.

401
04:22:46,280 --> 04:22:47,960
Champagne for the occasion?

402
04:22:48,120 --> 04:22:49,400
You guys have become
too fancy.

403
04:22:49,480 --> 04:22:51,960
The champagne is to
celebrate the nomination.

404
04:22:52,320 --> 04:22:53,280
What nomination?

405
04:22:53,560 --> 04:22:55,560
The Fearless Journalist
of the Year nomination?

406
04:22:55,680 --> 04:22:57,840
For the fourth time
in a row, Damini.

407
04:22:58,360 --> 04:22:59,080
What?

408
04:22:59,200 --> 04:22:59,920
Really?

409
04:23:00,160 --> 04:23:01,040
I mean...

410
04:23:01,720 --> 04:23:03,160
Wow!
-Wow!

411
04:23:03,440 --> 04:23:04,720
To fearless journalism?

412
04:23:04,920 --> 04:23:06,640
To fearless journalism!

413
04:23:08,040 --> 04:23:09,400
So how is I-can-ksha?

414
04:23:09,560 --> 04:23:10,440
She's busy.

415
04:23:10,480 --> 04:23:12,080
With a big scoop story.

416
04:23:12,360 --> 04:23:13,120
What scoop?

417
04:23:13,320 --> 04:23:15,200
Morally and ethically
it's all wrong.

418
04:23:15,480 --> 04:23:16,680
She's outing someone.

419
04:23:16,840 --> 04:23:17,680
Outing someone?

420
04:23:17,720 --> 04:23:18,360
Yes.

421
04:23:18,680 --> 04:23:20,560
A huge celeb.

422
04:23:21,200 --> 04:23:22,040
Samara Kapoor?

423
04:23:22,080 --> 04:23:24,560
Apparently, she's in a
lesbian relationship.

424
04:23:24,960 --> 04:23:26,400
With her personal trainer.

425
04:23:33,960 --> 04:23:35,080
Stand still.

426
04:23:35,160 --> 04:23:36,560
You'll ruin the pleats.

427
04:23:39,680 --> 04:23:40,800
What's wrong Umi?

428
04:23:41,440 --> 04:23:43,200
Are you not happy to
see me?

429
04:23:43,800 --> 04:23:44,640
Mom.

430
04:23:46,200 --> 04:23:48,440
Since when do you worry
about what your mother says?

431
04:23:48,960 --> 04:23:50,960
I'm not saying it for me.
It's for you.

432
04:23:51,160 --> 04:23:52,640
None of this is your
cup of tea.

433
04:23:52,720 --> 04:23:54,360
You won't be able
to adjust, Pinky.

434
04:23:54,960 --> 04:23:56,560
Yes, I know.

435
04:23:58,200 --> 04:24:00,040
I know your life is
very exciting.

436
04:24:01,160 --> 04:24:03,560
I keep seeing your photos
online.

437
04:24:05,360 --> 04:24:07,640
I'll change myself over time.

438
04:24:07,920 --> 04:24:08,960
I'll learn to speak in English.

439
04:24:09,040 --> 04:24:10,680
I'll change my appearance.
I'll do it all.

440
04:24:11,720 --> 04:24:12,720
What do you think?

441
04:24:13,280 --> 04:24:15,360
That life in Mumbai is
one big party?

442
04:24:15,680 --> 04:24:17,080
It takes sweat and blood.

443
04:24:17,160 --> 04:24:18,080
It takes pain.

444
04:24:18,120 --> 04:24:19,600
It takes hard work.

445
04:24:19,680 --> 04:24:21,480
You'll go back home in a week.

446
04:24:21,640 --> 04:24:22,880
And when you do,

447
04:24:23,080 --> 04:24:25,840
no one's going to give you
your old life back.

448
04:24:26,040 --> 04:24:27,560
I don't want to go back.

449
04:24:27,720 --> 04:24:29,480
I regret letting you go once.

450
04:24:29,480 --> 04:24:30,480
Pinky.

451
04:24:31,640 --> 04:24:32,720
Are you angry with me?

452
04:24:33,200 --> 04:24:35,040
Why are you saying my
name like that?

453
04:24:37,400 --> 04:24:38,480
Is there someone else?

454
04:24:41,960 --> 04:24:42,960
That girl on Instagram?

455
04:24:43,080 --> 04:24:44,840
You've done a full
investigation,
haven't you?

456
04:24:48,040 --> 04:24:50,120
Don't you love me anymore?

457
04:24:50,680 --> 04:24:51,720
I loved you Pinky.

458
04:24:51,840 --> 04:24:53,120
A little too much but...

459
04:24:53,200 --> 04:24:54,480
But you don't anymore.

460
04:24:56,120 --> 04:24:57,960
Should I wear gold or diamonds
around my neck?

461
04:24:58,080 --> 04:25:00,440
Our hosts will prefer diamonds,
won't they?

462
04:25:01,080 --> 04:25:02,120
Wow!

463
04:25:02,200 --> 04:25:04,680
My daughter and my
daughter-in-law
are looking so beautiful!

464
04:25:04,720 --> 04:25:06,840
May God protect both of you.

465
04:25:07,920 --> 04:25:08,680
Gorgeous!

466
04:25:09,160 --> 04:25:09,960
Gold is fine?

467
04:25:13,720 --> 04:25:15,440
What a pretty little girl.

468
04:25:15,720 --> 04:25:17,600
Thank you. You also pretty.

469
04:25:17,720 --> 04:25:18,880
Why, thank you.

470
04:25:19,360 --> 04:25:21,880
Are you Mamma's Pookie aunty?

471
04:25:25,400 --> 04:25:26,320
Hi!
-Hi!

472
04:25:26,400 --> 04:25:28,520
Festival greetings!
-Festival greetings!

473
04:25:28,640 --> 04:25:30,760
Festival greetings!
-Hi! Festival greetings guys!

474
04:25:30,920 --> 04:25:33,120
Arya, you cutie pie!

475
04:25:33,280 --> 04:25:35,280
Festival greetings!
-I'm Viju Patel.

476
04:25:35,320 --> 04:25:36,680
Festival greetings!

477
04:25:52,000 --> 04:25:53,480
Don't ruin your mood.

478
04:25:54,880 --> 04:25:55,880
We're at a party.

479
04:25:57,040 --> 04:25:58,160
We'll talk tomorrow.

480
04:26:08,480 --> 04:26:10,920
Festival greetings!
-How are you?

481
04:26:11,160 --> 04:26:13,080
Hello! How's Mama?
-She's fine.

482
04:26:19,400 --> 04:26:20,520
Welcome, welcome.

483
04:26:20,600 --> 04:26:21,800
Festival greetings!

484
04:26:21,840 --> 04:26:23,000
Hi!

485
04:26:24,200 --> 04:26:24,880
What are you doing?

486
04:26:24,920 --> 04:26:25,560
What?

487
04:26:25,640 --> 04:26:26,400
Okay, fine.

488
04:26:27,280 --> 04:26:28,160
What's wrong?

489
04:26:28,360 --> 04:26:29,400
Please, please.

490
04:26:29,480 --> 04:26:31,960
Festival greetings!
-Festival greetings!

491
04:26:33,800 --> 04:26:35,040
Festival greetings, uncle.

492
04:26:58,600 --> 04:26:59,920
Guys, where's Dee?

493
04:27:00,000 --> 04:27:01,800
I can't wait. I really need
this guys, I'm sorry.

494
04:27:02,280 --> 04:27:03,000
Here.

495
04:27:04,440 --> 04:27:05,120
Hey!

496
04:27:05,960 --> 04:27:06,640
Hang on.

497
04:27:07,640 --> 04:27:09,240
No wasting alcohol.

498
04:27:10,080 --> 04:27:12,240
Festival greetings!
-Festival greetings!

499
04:27:13,200 --> 04:27:14,680
Umang, I need to speak to you.

500
04:27:14,920 --> 04:27:15,680
Where were you?

501
04:27:15,800 --> 04:27:17,360
Siddi-Piddi!
-Umang!

502
04:27:20,480 --> 04:27:22,560
Siddhi Patel, can you come up
and join me?

503
04:27:25,760 --> 04:27:26,480
Go!

504
04:27:26,560 --> 04:27:27,920
Go Siddhi...
-Go!

505
04:27:28,280 --> 04:27:29,680
Okay, I'm going...

506
04:27:31,920 --> 04:27:34,680
From diapers to kindergarten,

507
04:27:34,760 --> 04:27:38,800
to all those dance routines
we practised!

508
04:27:40,520 --> 04:27:41,880
To dancing in Goa.

509
04:27:42,840 --> 04:27:45,680
I just know that...

510
04:27:46,480 --> 04:27:50,280
...Mihu-Pihu and
Siddi-Piddi are forever so...

511
04:27:57,360 --> 04:27:58,520
Siddi-Piddi!

512
04:27:59,880 --> 04:28:01,000
Will you marry me?

513
04:28:01,160 --> 04:28:02,240
Say yes!

514
04:28:02,960 --> 04:28:04,160
Say yes!

515
04:28:08,680 --> 04:28:11,080
My darling baby is
getting married!

516
04:28:24,320 --> 04:28:25,560
Congrats.

517
04:28:27,280 --> 04:28:28,280
Welcome to the family.

518
04:28:28,360 --> 04:28:29,480
Thank you.

519
04:28:29,680 --> 04:28:31,520
Congratulations!

520
04:28:31,640 --> 04:28:32,720
Oh my God.

521
04:28:33,480 --> 04:28:37,360
Siddhi, I always wanted
for you to be my
daughter-in-law.

522
04:28:39,040 --> 04:28:40,120
God bless you.

523
04:28:42,000 --> 04:28:43,480
So excited!

524
04:28:43,560 --> 04:28:44,640
Oh my God!

525
04:28:44,720 --> 04:28:47,840
Sids, your
'Knight-in-shining-armour
-on-a-white-horse' wish...

526
04:28:47,920 --> 04:28:49,280
...actually came true!

527
04:28:49,360 --> 04:28:50,000
Actually!

528
04:28:50,080 --> 04:28:51,480
Mihir is scared of horses.

529
04:28:51,560 --> 04:28:53,080
Sids, you're going to live in
New York.

530
04:28:53,120 --> 04:28:54,080
New York man!

531
04:28:54,320 --> 04:28:55,960
I hate New York!

532
04:28:56,040 --> 04:28:57,720
You have to walk everywhere.

533
04:28:57,880 --> 04:28:59,120
And it keeps snowing there.

534
04:28:59,160 --> 04:29:00,320
I hate the cold!

535
04:29:00,520 --> 04:29:02,320
You'll get used to it.
What's the big deal?

536
04:29:02,400 --> 04:29:02,880
Ya!

537
04:29:02,920 --> 04:29:04,560
And anyway, Mihir seems like a
really great guy.

538
04:29:04,600 --> 04:29:05,320
Ya.

539
04:29:05,560 --> 04:29:07,240
It's only been a week
since we've met.

540
04:29:07,560 --> 04:29:10,120
Wait a second, aren't you guys
childhood friends?

541
04:29:13,560 --> 04:29:14,360
Sids...

542
04:29:16,040 --> 04:29:17,080
What's wrong?

543
04:29:18,760 --> 04:29:20,800
What happened?
Why're you crying?

544
04:29:20,920 --> 04:29:22,400
Sids.
-What happened baby?

545
04:29:22,600 --> 04:29:23,760
Did I do something wrong?

546
04:29:23,840 --> 04:29:25,280
No. It's not you.

547
04:29:25,360 --> 04:29:26,680
But you said yes!

548
04:29:26,960 --> 04:29:28,880
Actually, I didn't say anything.

549
04:29:30,480 --> 04:29:32,280
You mean, you don't want
to get married?

550
04:29:32,640 --> 04:29:33,360
I do.

551
04:29:33,440 --> 04:29:34,760
Someday, I guess.

552
04:29:34,840 --> 04:29:35,960
You guess?

553
04:29:37,320 --> 04:29:38,320
I don't know.

554
04:29:38,480 --> 04:29:39,360
Okay, okay...

555
04:29:39,720 --> 04:29:40,440
If you do...

556
04:29:40,760 --> 04:29:41,640
...get married...

557
04:29:42,560 --> 04:29:43,760
...it will be to me, right?

558
04:29:47,240 --> 04:29:48,800
Oh man.

559
04:29:49,000 --> 04:29:49,960
Look Mihir...

560
04:29:50,880 --> 04:29:52,760
You're the perfect package.

561
04:29:52,880 --> 04:29:54,840
You're smart, you're
intelligent.

562
04:29:55,080 --> 04:29:56,840
Good looking, successful.

563
04:29:57,760 --> 04:29:59,960
Classy on the outside,
massy on the inside.

564
04:30:00,640 --> 04:30:02,280
And you treat me
like a princess.

565
04:30:02,360 --> 04:30:05,160
And you make me laugh.
-Then what's the problem?

566
04:30:05,560 --> 04:30:07,240
That I'm parent approved?

567
04:30:07,280 --> 04:30:07,680
No.

568
04:30:07,760 --> 04:30:08,440
Shall we elope?

569
04:30:08,560 --> 04:30:09,360
Just for thrills?

570
04:30:09,440 --> 04:30:10,680
Let's just run!

571
04:30:10,880 --> 04:30:11,840
You know Mihir...

572
04:30:12,640 --> 04:30:14,640
I always wanted this.

573
04:30:15,040 --> 04:30:17,360
Or at least I thought
I wanted this.

574
04:30:18,160 --> 04:30:20,600
But now I think marriage was
just an excuse...

575
04:30:20,640 --> 04:30:21,680
...to get Sneha off my back.

576
04:30:21,760 --> 04:30:22,640
And now?

577
04:30:24,320 --> 04:30:25,080
And now...

578
04:30:25,840 --> 04:30:27,480
...when this is actually
happening...

579
04:30:29,960 --> 04:30:31,960
...Mihir, I'm really scared.

580
04:30:32,880 --> 04:30:35,320
I mean, I don't even know
myself yet.

581
04:30:35,560 --> 04:30:38,400
How can I make such
a big lifelong commitment?

582
04:30:38,560 --> 04:30:39,480
And you know what?

583
04:30:39,960 --> 04:30:41,720
How can the solution to all
my problems in life...

584
04:30:41,760 --> 04:30:43,880
...lie in finding a husband?

585
04:30:48,000 --> 04:30:49,760
Mangs, they're outing her.

586
04:30:50,280 --> 04:30:51,240
And you.

587
04:30:52,880 --> 04:30:54,760
She has that amazing
PR agency of hers.

588
04:30:54,840 --> 04:30:56,680
I'm sure they're already on it,
doing damage control.

589
04:30:56,760 --> 04:30:58,360
They can't help her this time.

590
04:30:59,600 --> 04:31:00,960
They have proof.

591
04:31:01,640 --> 04:31:04,440
Photos of you and her in
Goa in...

592
04:31:05,200 --> 04:31:06,520
...compromising positions.

593
04:31:07,120 --> 04:31:09,000
I'm sorry I can't stop the
story.

594
04:31:09,800 --> 04:31:11,920
This is not even your fault.

595
04:31:12,480 --> 04:31:14,520
That's what I get for
falling in love.

596
04:31:14,600 --> 04:31:15,840
Fuck me!

597
04:31:20,040 --> 04:31:21,720
So this...

598
04:31:22,680 --> 04:31:24,000
...is a no?
-No.

599
04:31:24,280 --> 04:31:25,320
So this is a yes...

600
04:31:25,400 --> 04:31:26,080
...with footnotes.

601
04:31:26,120 --> 04:31:26,640
Yes.

602
04:31:26,840 --> 04:31:27,360
No.

603
04:31:27,480 --> 04:31:28,000
I mean...

604
04:31:28,280 --> 04:31:29,280
Man!

605
04:31:29,360 --> 04:31:31,280
Look Mihu-Pihu...

606
04:31:31,600 --> 04:31:34,040
I also really, really like you.

607
04:31:34,120 --> 04:31:35,120
A lot.

608
04:31:35,880 --> 04:31:37,440
But what's the rush?

609
04:31:37,760 --> 04:31:38,640
Let's...

610
04:31:39,600 --> 04:31:40,720
Let's hang out a bit.

611
04:31:40,880 --> 04:31:42,280
Let's travel.

612
04:31:42,360 --> 04:31:43,720
Let's fight.

613
04:31:43,760 --> 04:31:44,800
And then make up.

614
04:31:45,640 --> 04:31:46,440
And...

615
04:31:46,640 --> 04:31:47,760
...let's have some...

616
04:31:47,880 --> 04:31:49,600
...great unattached sex?

617
04:31:53,360 --> 04:31:55,920
Fuck! I think I just fell
in love with you all over again.

618
04:31:56,280 --> 04:31:56,920
Really?

619
04:31:57,160 --> 04:31:58,200
You're not upset with me?

620
04:31:58,280 --> 04:32:00,280
No, of course not Siddhi.

621
04:32:00,360 --> 04:32:01,080
I mean...

622
04:32:01,440 --> 04:32:04,120
This is what a relationship
is built on right?

623
04:32:04,200 --> 04:32:05,160
Trust and...

624
04:32:05,320 --> 04:32:06,600
...honesty and respect.

625
04:32:06,680 --> 04:32:08,680
I mean, that's the only
way we'll ever be happy.

626
04:32:10,040 --> 04:32:10,480
Really?

627
04:32:10,560 --> 04:32:12,400
Siddi-Piddi!

628
04:32:12,920 --> 04:32:15,400
Hell, even I don't know
who I am.

629
04:32:16,200 --> 04:32:19,800
I would love to go on
this adventure with you and...

630
04:32:20,120 --> 04:32:22,200
...even if we don't reach the
finish line at least...

631
04:32:22,720 --> 04:32:24,160
...we'll be together.

632
04:32:35,960 --> 04:32:38,120
One second. One second.
-Oh man...

633
04:32:49,200 --> 04:32:50,320
Siddhi?
