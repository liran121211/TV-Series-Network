1
04:34:33,480 --> 04:34:35,760
In life, if you don't take a
few risks,

2
04:34:35,960 --> 04:34:37,160
you haven't lived.

3
04:34:37,720 --> 04:34:39,160
So every once in a while,

4
04:34:39,240 --> 04:34:40,400
take off those shoes,

5
04:34:40,520 --> 04:34:41,240
let go,

6
04:34:41,480 --> 04:34:42,880
and dance on the edge.

7
04:34:53,200 --> 04:34:54,760
What do you mean
you're pushing it?

8
04:34:56,360 --> 04:34:57,840
I mean, we'll decide in a
few days.

9
04:34:57,920 --> 04:34:59,080
How many days?

10
04:34:59,760 --> 04:35:00,920
I don't know at this point.

11
04:35:02,840 --> 04:35:04,520
What have you done this time...

12
04:35:04,520 --> 04:35:06,360
...to make this boy run
away too?

13
04:35:06,720 --> 04:35:07,880
I haven't done anything.

14
04:35:07,920 --> 04:35:10,760
This boy was ready to
marry her today!

15
04:35:10,960 --> 04:35:12,880
Now she's messed
this up as well.

16
04:35:12,960 --> 04:35:14,400
I haven't done anything Mom!

17
04:35:14,480 --> 04:35:16,200
Every single time, Siddhi.

18
04:35:16,280 --> 04:35:17,040
Every time.

19
04:35:17,120 --> 04:35:19,160
Why do you do this to me?

20
04:35:35,480 --> 04:35:36,840
Don't you worry, Siddhi.

21
04:35:37,360 --> 04:35:38,920
You want more time?

22
04:35:39,040 --> 04:35:39,920
Take it.

23
04:35:40,000 --> 04:35:41,120
Only once you're ready...

24
04:35:41,120 --> 04:35:44,200
...will your father sign off on
your wedding checks.

25
04:35:46,400 --> 04:35:47,400
Love you Papa.

26
04:35:47,720 --> 04:35:48,840
Love you too my child.

27
04:35:56,880 --> 04:35:58,120
Mamma...

28
04:35:58,280 --> 04:35:59,480
Yes baby...

29
04:35:59,840 --> 04:36:01,320
You're my best friend.

30
04:36:01,360 --> 04:36:03,040
Even more than Teddoo.

31
04:36:04,720 --> 04:36:06,000
And you're mine.

32
04:36:06,160 --> 04:36:07,280
My sweetheart!

33
04:36:11,720 --> 04:36:12,640
Umang,

34
04:36:12,840 --> 04:36:15,080
have you thought
about getting married?

35
04:36:15,360 --> 04:36:16,600
I'll do it.

36
04:36:16,680 --> 04:36:19,760
All the other girls
your age are married.

37
04:36:20,120 --> 04:36:21,640
I said I'll do it.

38
04:36:21,920 --> 04:36:22,520
Really?

39
04:36:23,000 --> 04:36:24,440
I hope you're not joking.

40
04:36:24,880 --> 04:36:27,360
I've found the perfect boy for you.

41
04:36:27,440 --> 04:36:29,080
His family is very wealthy.

42
04:36:29,480 --> 04:36:30,480
Set up a meeting.

43
04:36:33,800 --> 04:36:34,840
Pinky,

44
04:36:34,840 --> 04:36:37,080
now all we need is
some good news from you.

45
04:36:45,160 --> 04:36:46,000
Hey!

46
04:36:47,120 --> 04:36:47,800
Hey.

47
04:36:50,600 --> 04:36:53,000
I just dropped in to finish
off some editorial work.

48
04:36:53,600 --> 04:36:54,840
Okay. Sure.

49
04:36:57,400 --> 04:36:58,440
I'm sorry.

50
04:37:00,040 --> 04:37:00,680
For what?

51
04:37:01,840 --> 04:37:02,600
You know...

52
04:37:03,680 --> 04:37:04,600
...replacing you.

53
04:37:07,000 --> 04:37:08,800
No one can replace me.

54
04:37:11,600 --> 04:37:12,360
Well,

55
04:37:14,080 --> 04:37:14,880
good luck.

56
04:37:15,960 --> 04:37:16,800
You too.

57
04:38:34,400 --> 04:38:36,240
Is anyone going to say anything?

58
04:38:41,560 --> 04:38:42,680
Seriously...

59
04:38:43,480 --> 04:38:45,000
...how can you be so dumb?

60
04:38:45,960 --> 04:38:47,080
Excuse me?

61
04:38:48,520 --> 04:38:52,160
How can you put yourself in
such a compromising position, Siddhi?

62
04:38:52,240 --> 04:38:53,560
Anj, have you lost your mind?

63
04:38:53,640 --> 04:38:55,200
You're victim blaming?

64
04:38:55,720 --> 04:38:57,640
That's just horribly
sexist and disgusting.

65
04:38:57,720 --> 04:39:00,240
And that's very harsh
and presumptuous.

66
04:39:00,360 --> 04:39:02,680
Guys, we're living in
a world full of shitty...

67
04:39:02,760 --> 04:39:05,120
...misogynistic men who
are predators.

68
04:39:05,920 --> 04:39:07,800
And until this thought
doesn't change,

69
04:39:08,000 --> 04:39:10,360
we need to protect ourselves.

70
04:39:10,480 --> 04:39:12,000
Why? Aren't we human?

71
04:39:12,320 --> 04:39:13,760
Can't we, for once, do what
we want?

72
04:39:13,800 --> 04:39:15,360
I did it for myself, okay.

73
04:39:15,640 --> 04:39:17,120
Because it felt good.

74
04:39:17,440 --> 04:39:19,080
And I'll do it again in a heartbeat.

75
04:39:19,360 --> 04:39:21,880
So please, go ahead and
judge me like you always do.

76
04:39:21,920 --> 04:39:22,640
I don't care.

77
04:39:22,800 --> 04:39:23,520
Great.

78
04:39:23,800 --> 04:39:24,680
Throw a tantrum.

79
04:39:24,760 --> 04:39:26,360
Like you always do.

80
04:39:27,240 --> 04:39:29,880
Siddhi, your Sneha hangover
makes you do stupid things...

81
04:39:29,920 --> 04:39:31,040
...and then you suffer.

82
04:39:31,440 --> 04:39:32,040
Ya?

83
04:39:32,040 --> 04:39:34,880
Sneha's hangover is any day
better than Varun's hangover.

84
04:39:34,920 --> 04:39:36,520
I don't give a fuck about
Varun okay!

85
04:39:36,600 --> 04:39:37,680
I don't care!

86
04:39:37,760 --> 04:39:38,800
Famous last words.

87
04:39:38,920 --> 04:39:41,360
This is what happens when you sleep
with just one person your entire life.

88
04:39:43,120 --> 04:39:45,200
At least I'm not sleeping around
with the whole world.

89
04:39:45,360 --> 04:39:46,240
Like you.

90
04:39:46,320 --> 04:39:46,920
Anj...

91
04:39:47,040 --> 04:39:50,480
Between Arya, your child groom and
obsessing about that Kavya...

92
04:39:50,560 --> 04:39:52,000
...you don't know whether
you're coming or going.

93
04:39:52,080 --> 04:39:53,720
What exactly are you implying?

94
04:39:53,800 --> 04:39:55,040
If you weren't so distracted,

95
04:39:55,040 --> 04:39:56,520
we wouldn't have lost
all those cases...

96
04:39:56,600 --> 04:39:58,160
...and I would still
have my fucking company.

97
04:39:58,240 --> 04:39:59,800
And if you had fact checked...

98
04:39:59,800 --> 04:40:02,000
...before putting out such
blasphemous articles...

99
04:40:02,080 --> 04:40:03,920
...maybe you would still
have your fucking company.

100
04:40:04,000 --> 04:40:05,080
Shut up guys!

101
04:40:05,160 --> 04:40:05,920
Both of you!

102
04:40:06,000 --> 04:40:06,600
All of you!

103
04:40:06,680 --> 04:40:08,520
We came here to discuss
my problems right?

104
04:40:08,600 --> 04:40:11,080
But, as usual, you've made it only
about yourselves.

105
04:40:11,280 --> 04:40:13,200
You want to know why I
went onto SexyBods?

106
04:40:13,280 --> 04:40:16,560
Because no one constantly
criticizes me there.

107
04:40:17,080 --> 04:40:19,000
At home it's Sneha and out here,
it's you guys.

108
04:40:21,320 --> 04:40:22,720
You know, for once...

109
04:40:22,800 --> 04:40:25,160
...for once I felt good about myself.

110
04:40:25,240 --> 04:40:27,760
Being a SexyBods girl has given
me more confidence...

111
04:40:27,840 --> 04:40:29,960
...than all of you have
in the last three years.

112
04:40:30,080 --> 04:40:31,200
So fuck this shit.

113
04:40:31,240 --> 04:40:32,640
I don't need you guys.

114
04:40:32,720 --> 04:40:34,400
I'll handle that bastard
on my own.

115
04:40:45,600 --> 04:40:46,720
Shit.

116
04:40:47,560 --> 04:40:48,440
Siddhi...

117
04:40:50,840 --> 04:40:52,120
Hi, uncle.

118
04:40:53,040 --> 04:40:54,560
What a surprise.

119
04:40:54,880 --> 04:40:55,840
Come, sit.

120
04:41:00,880 --> 04:41:03,040
I didn't know that you come here.

121
04:41:03,280 --> 04:41:04,520
I haven't seen you here before.

122
04:41:05,000 --> 04:41:06,360
We have a date, right?

123
04:41:06,720 --> 04:41:09,200
Me and my soon to be daughter-in-law.

124
04:41:09,280 --> 04:41:10,280
Babygirl.

125
04:41:13,720 --> 04:41:14,720
I'm sorry, what?

126
04:41:14,920 --> 04:41:17,400
Ever since I saw Babygirl
on that site for the first time,

127
04:41:17,560 --> 04:41:19,760
I've been anxiously waiting
to meet her.

128
04:41:20,080 --> 04:41:22,080
I kept wondering who it could be.

129
04:41:22,360 --> 04:41:23,920
And then, right behind you...

130
04:41:24,000 --> 04:41:25,960
...I spotted Sneha and
Viju's wedding photos.

131
04:41:26,280 --> 04:41:27,000
That was it.

132
04:41:27,320 --> 04:41:28,520
I instantly realised...

133
04:41:29,040 --> 04:41:31,280
...who Babygirl is.

134
04:41:31,600 --> 04:41:33,040
Aren't you ashamed?

135
04:41:33,960 --> 04:41:34,800
Why?

136
04:41:35,160 --> 04:41:37,120
I was only admiring you.

137
04:41:37,320 --> 04:41:38,480
C'mon, Siddhi.

138
04:41:38,560 --> 04:41:39,880
You're an adult.

139
04:41:40,560 --> 04:41:41,400
Figure it out.

140
04:41:41,920 --> 04:41:43,040
What is that supposed to mean?

141
04:41:44,560 --> 04:41:45,880
Our society is such that...

142
04:41:45,960 --> 04:41:48,040
...it makes us live two lives, Babygirl.

143
04:41:48,120 --> 04:41:48,840
Stop it!

144
04:41:48,920 --> 04:41:49,840
Stop calling me that.

145
04:41:51,000 --> 04:41:52,760
Isn't that what you call yourself?

146
04:41:53,320 --> 04:41:55,480
And I am on your side.

147
04:41:58,160 --> 04:41:58,920
In fact,

148
04:41:59,280 --> 04:42:00,320
in our entire family...

149
04:42:00,400 --> 04:42:01,760
...if there's anyone who
can understand you,

150
04:42:01,840 --> 04:42:02,720
it's me.

151
04:42:02,800 --> 04:42:04,400
I'm not your family.

152
04:42:04,640 --> 04:42:06,000
Nor will you ever be.

153
04:42:07,160 --> 04:42:07,960
What?

154
04:42:08,040 --> 04:42:10,000
Call off your engagement
with Mihir.

155
04:42:10,080 --> 04:42:11,080
This is our secret.

156
04:42:11,360 --> 04:42:12,520
And it will stay that way.

157
04:42:12,680 --> 04:42:14,120
And if you still want your...

158
04:42:14,400 --> 04:42:16,160
...'happily ever after'...

159
04:42:16,320 --> 04:42:17,600
...then why just Mihir.

160
04:42:17,880 --> 04:42:18,920
I'm available too.

161
04:42:19,800 --> 04:42:21,160
You are sick.

162
04:42:21,280 --> 04:42:22,080
You need help.

163
04:42:22,160 --> 04:42:23,000
I see...

164
04:42:23,680 --> 04:42:25,680
You're the one taking off your
clothes for strangers.

165
04:42:26,240 --> 04:42:27,520
And I need help?

166
04:42:27,680 --> 04:42:29,480
You bloody prostitute.

167
04:42:31,040 --> 04:42:32,480
Siddhi's still here.

168
04:42:33,320 --> 04:42:34,480
Isn't that Mihir's father?

169
04:42:34,560 --> 04:42:35,800
You think you're going to
expose me?

170
04:42:35,880 --> 04:42:37,160
I will expose you!

171
04:42:37,240 --> 04:42:39,920
I don't want to be a part
of your family.

172
04:42:40,800 --> 04:42:43,520
Sneha's made a family
WhatsApp group with all of us.

173
04:42:43,960 --> 04:42:45,360
I'll post this on the group.

174
04:42:45,440 --> 04:42:46,360
Poor Sneha.

175
04:42:47,120 --> 04:42:48,360
Her engagement broke
years ago.

176
04:42:48,720 --> 04:42:49,760
And now yours.

177
04:42:49,960 --> 04:42:51,120
I fear...

178
04:42:51,360 --> 04:42:52,840
...she may jump to her death.

179
04:42:53,640 --> 04:42:54,840
You bastard!

180
04:42:54,920 --> 04:42:57,200
How dare you talk about
my mother like that!

181
04:42:57,280 --> 04:42:58,920
Siddhi! Leave him!

182
04:42:59,000 --> 04:42:59,720
Asshole!

183
04:42:59,840 --> 04:43:01,080
I'll kill that bastard!

184
04:43:01,160 --> 04:43:02,680
It's been a pleasure meeting you,
Babygirl.

185
04:43:07,000 --> 04:43:09,000
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

186
04:43:23,880 --> 04:43:26,040
Bosco, can we get an
ice pack please...

187
04:43:27,880 --> 04:43:28,840
Fuck this.

188
04:43:29,040 --> 04:43:30,320
Siddhi, wait.

189
04:43:30,400 --> 04:43:31,600
Please leave me alone.

190
04:43:33,280 --> 04:43:34,880
I can't do this. I have to go.

191
04:43:37,000 --> 04:43:38,240
I have to go too.

192
04:43:38,320 --> 04:43:39,480
Awards ceremony.

193
04:43:40,400 --> 04:43:41,960
So go! Who's stopping you!

194
04:43:46,760 --> 04:43:48,760
Bosco, a double whiskey
straight up please.

195
04:43:57,040 --> 04:43:57,640
Hey...

196
04:44:02,400 --> 04:44:03,000
Drink?

197
04:44:04,000 --> 04:44:04,760
No...

198
04:44:05,960 --> 04:44:06,760
I have to leave.

199
04:44:06,880 --> 04:44:08,360
There's an awards ceremony today.

200
04:44:08,880 --> 04:44:10,280
I've been nominated.

201
04:44:13,440 --> 04:44:14,520
For the troll story.

202
04:44:15,880 --> 04:44:17,040
Congratulations.

203
04:44:19,880 --> 04:44:23,000
So I was wondering if you...

204
04:44:23,080 --> 04:44:24,440
...wanted to...

205
04:44:25,200 --> 04:44:27,040
...go, I mean, come...

206
04:44:27,440 --> 04:44:28,440
...I mean...

207
04:44:29,240 --> 04:44:30,440
...go with me.

208
04:44:30,600 --> 04:44:32,280
Damini, like this? Last moment?

209
04:44:32,640 --> 04:44:33,880
To leave the bar?

210
04:44:35,040 --> 04:44:36,600
I'm sorry but...
-Ya, ya, of course.

211
04:44:36,640 --> 04:44:38,280
I understand. It's okay.

212
04:44:38,360 --> 04:44:39,760
I'm sure you will win.

213
04:44:42,440 --> 04:44:43,760
Fourth time lucky.

214
04:45:03,000 --> 04:45:04,520
These are my so called 'friends'.

215
04:45:05,880 --> 04:45:09,160
No, you should've seen the way
they were attacking me.

216
04:45:10,200 --> 04:45:13,040
As if there's nothing likeable
about me.

217
04:45:13,160 --> 04:45:13,840
Look,

218
04:45:14,000 --> 04:45:15,840
I really want to hear everything.

219
04:45:16,880 --> 04:45:18,200
But a two minute loo break?

220
04:45:19,840 --> 04:45:21,040
Arjun...
-Please?

221
04:45:22,280 --> 04:45:23,840
Such a mood breaker. Go.

222
04:45:23,880 --> 04:45:25,640
I'll be right back, sorry.

223
04:45:37,760 --> 04:45:38,960
Hey, Kavya...

224
04:45:39,200 --> 04:45:40,400
All okay?

225
04:45:42,080 --> 04:45:43,000
What?

226
04:45:43,600 --> 04:45:44,800
Have you given her some medicine?

227
04:45:45,920 --> 04:45:47,240
Cold compress?

228
04:45:47,960 --> 04:45:49,360
A hundred and five?

229
04:45:51,480 --> 04:45:52,560
Where is Varun?

230
04:45:54,160 --> 04:45:56,400
What do you mean by you can't
get a hold of him?

231
04:46:01,200 --> 04:46:02,280
You have the car?

232
04:46:02,920 --> 04:46:03,600
Just...

233
04:46:04,400 --> 04:46:05,880
You...you can't fucking drive!

234
04:46:05,960 --> 04:46:07,000
Okay fine, you know what.

235
04:46:07,040 --> 04:46:08,040
I'm coming, okay!

236
04:46:08,120 --> 04:46:09,000
Just...

237
04:46:18,440 --> 04:46:20,280
And the award goes to...

238
04:46:20,640 --> 04:46:22,400
The Aurorus Media Group.

239
04:46:24,400 --> 04:46:25,320
Damini...

240
04:46:26,360 --> 04:46:29,160
I'm sorry to hear that they snatched
your company from you.

241
04:46:30,320 --> 04:46:31,880
It's okay. I'm fine.

242
04:46:32,200 --> 04:46:34,160
Well, good luck for the award then.
-Very well deserved guys. You guys have done...

243
04:46:34,240 --> 04:46:35,480
...remarkable job.
-Thanks.

244
04:46:41,240 --> 04:46:42,360
Fuck.

245
04:46:42,960 --> 04:46:46,720
For our next award, I would like
to invite the Chairman of MD Group.

246
04:46:46,800 --> 04:46:48,280
Mr. Rajiv Chopra.

247
04:46:48,360 --> 04:46:51,280
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome him on stage.

248
04:46:54,240 --> 04:46:55,680
Pick up, Umang.

249
04:46:56,960 --> 04:46:58,200
C'mon, Umang.

250
04:46:58,400 --> 04:46:59,960
Believe it or not,

251
04:47:00,160 --> 04:47:02,280
my sister Umang and
my wife Pinky...

252
04:47:03,000 --> 04:47:04,040
...are best friends.

253
04:47:04,160 --> 04:47:06,480
And very soon, we'll be
best friends as well.

254
04:47:06,560 --> 04:47:08,360
Yes, of course, brother-in-law.

255
04:47:08,440 --> 04:47:09,320
Cheers.

256
04:47:11,360 --> 04:47:12,760
Are the 'tattus' real?

257
04:47:13,280 --> 04:47:14,880
A horse is called 'tattu'.

258
04:47:14,960 --> 04:47:15,880
These are tattoos.

259
04:47:16,400 --> 04:47:17,600
You're very funny.

260
04:47:18,160 --> 04:47:19,480
So many 'tattus'?

261
04:47:19,640 --> 04:47:20,760
They must be fake.

262
04:47:21,880 --> 04:47:22,840
They are.

263
04:47:22,920 --> 04:47:24,720
I stick them on every morning.

264
04:47:24,800 --> 04:47:26,640
Once we're married,
we'll get real ones.

265
04:47:26,800 --> 04:47:28,120
Of each other's names.

266
04:47:29,280 --> 04:47:30,360
I must say,

267
04:47:30,720 --> 04:47:32,480
you have great biceps.

268
04:47:32,560 --> 04:47:35,160
I deadlift a hundred and twenty kilos.

269
04:47:35,200 --> 04:47:36,360
Every alternate day.

270
04:47:37,280 --> 04:47:38,360
Wow!

271
04:47:38,520 --> 04:47:39,200
Which means...

272
04:47:39,240 --> 04:47:41,080
...after our marriage, my
personal training is guaranteed.

273
04:47:41,520 --> 04:47:43,400
Oh. So I will be allowed
to work after marriage?

274
04:47:43,480 --> 04:47:44,840
Yes, of course!

275
04:47:44,880 --> 04:47:46,640
I'm not so narrow-minded.

276
04:47:48,080 --> 04:47:49,280
Please take some more
butter chicken.

277
04:47:49,320 --> 04:47:50,360
Your plate's empty.

278
04:47:50,400 --> 04:47:51,320
Yes. Of course.

279
04:47:51,360 --> 04:47:52,520
Pinky, will you please...

280
04:47:54,560 --> 04:47:55,840
Pinky,

281
04:47:55,920 --> 04:47:56,920
careful please...

282
04:47:57,160 --> 04:47:57,960
It's alright.

283
04:47:58,040 --> 04:48:00,280
Once you're married,
Umang will wash it off for you.

284
04:48:00,800 --> 04:48:02,560
She's an expert at removing stains.

285
04:48:02,600 --> 04:48:03,640
Not at all.

286
04:48:03,680 --> 04:48:05,880
I will keep her like a princess.

287
04:48:05,960 --> 04:48:08,280
We have plenty of staff at home.

288
04:48:08,320 --> 04:48:09,160
Oh, my God.

289
04:48:09,440 --> 04:48:10,680
Shocking news.

290
04:48:11,280 --> 04:48:13,040
Samara Kapoor is a Lebanese.

291
04:48:13,120 --> 04:48:14,240
Lebanese?

292
04:48:14,520 --> 04:48:16,000
The shawarma?

293
04:48:16,080 --> 04:48:17,240
Not Lebanese.

294
04:48:17,280 --> 04:48:18,720
It's Lisbon. They're called Lisbon.

295
04:48:18,800 --> 04:48:20,520
Lisbon. Okay.

296
04:48:21,520 --> 04:48:23,240
Bizarre.
-Look at these photos.

297
04:48:23,320 --> 04:48:25,600
She's locking lips with another girl.

298
04:48:25,680 --> 04:48:29,120
Weren't Samara Kapoor
and Raghuveer getting married?

299
04:48:29,200 --> 04:48:30,680
Did you see that film?

300
04:48:30,760 --> 04:48:32,120
'Your Killed Me With Your Eyes'...

301
04:48:32,200 --> 04:48:34,640
That's when Raghuveer
had an affair with his co-star.

302
04:48:34,720 --> 04:48:36,440
The inevitable happened.
The wedding was called off.

303
04:48:36,880 --> 04:48:38,680
These film stars...

304
04:48:38,760 --> 04:48:40,280
They don't know the
meaning of decency.

305
04:48:40,360 --> 04:48:41,680
This Samara Kapoor...

306
04:48:42,200 --> 04:48:43,160
...is an immoral woman.

307
04:48:43,280 --> 04:48:46,200
What is this Lebanese-Lisbon thing?

308
04:48:46,280 --> 04:48:47,680
It means nothing, uncle.

309
04:48:48,000 --> 04:48:49,320
It's a mental illness.

310
04:48:49,400 --> 04:48:52,840
Enjoy your drink.
-It's the latest trend these days.

311
04:48:53,320 --> 04:48:56,120
Some spiritual leader has
created a tonic...

312
04:48:56,200 --> 04:48:59,240
...which can cure these Lisbons.
-Lesbian!

313
04:48:59,320 --> 04:49:01,480
It's not Lisbon or Lebanese.
It's Lesbian!

314
04:49:01,560 --> 04:49:02,800
And it's not a mental illness.

315
04:49:02,880 --> 04:49:04,440
Umang, what are you ranting
on about?

316
04:49:04,440 --> 04:49:04,920
Sit down!

317
04:49:05,000 --> 04:49:06,480
All of you have so much fun...

318
04:49:06,560 --> 04:49:08,200
...passing judgements on others!

319
04:49:08,280 --> 04:49:10,360
Your own lives are so empty...

320
04:49:10,440 --> 04:49:11,640
...that by demeaning someone else's life...

321
04:49:11,640 --> 04:49:13,040
...you feel so good about yourself!

322
04:49:13,120 --> 04:49:14,520
Each one of you is a hypocrite!

323
04:49:15,440 --> 04:49:17,080
And I am the biggest
hypocrite of us all.

324
04:49:19,840 --> 04:49:21,760
That girl with Samara Kapoor?

325
04:49:22,400 --> 04:49:23,560
That's me.

326
04:49:24,520 --> 04:49:25,560
Your daughter.

327
04:49:25,880 --> 04:49:27,000
Your sister.

328
04:49:27,840 --> 04:49:29,480
Is a lesbian, bi-sexual, queer,

329
04:49:29,520 --> 04:49:30,760
part of the LGBT community.

330
04:49:30,840 --> 04:49:32,800
You can label me as you like.

331
04:49:33,280 --> 04:49:34,920
All I know is that...

332
04:49:35,040 --> 04:49:36,920
I love Samara.

333
04:49:39,560 --> 04:49:40,440
Does that mean...

334
04:49:41,120 --> 04:49:43,440
...there's no chance of us
getting married?

335
04:49:43,880 --> 04:49:45,440
From all the girls I've met,

336
04:49:45,640 --> 04:49:47,280
you're the best.

337
04:50:01,560 --> 04:50:02,680
I'm coming...

338
04:50:04,960 --> 04:50:06,560
Anjana, I've called the doctor and...

339
04:50:06,600 --> 04:50:08,640
...and Varun's also on his way.

340
04:50:09,760 --> 04:50:11,760
Anjana, what are you doing?

341
04:50:12,040 --> 04:50:13,320
I'm taking Arya to the hospital.

342
04:50:13,880 --> 04:50:15,360
Anjana, listen to me.

343
04:50:15,440 --> 04:50:16,240
You're drunk.

344
04:50:16,320 --> 04:50:17,400
You're stinking of alcohol.

345
04:50:17,480 --> 04:50:18,720
I'll book a cab, okay?

346
04:50:18,800 --> 04:50:19,880
There's no time, Kavya.
-No, no, just...

347
04:50:19,960 --> 04:50:21,760
I have to take her to the
hospital now.

348
04:50:21,760 --> 04:50:22,600
Okay, just...
-Okay?

349
04:50:22,680 --> 04:50:24,480
...just hold on, I'll come along
with you.

350
04:50:24,560 --> 04:50:26,640
Anjana, let me at least
come with you!

351
04:50:29,960 --> 04:50:33,480
And the award for Fearless
Journalist of the Year goes to...

352
04:50:33,560 --> 04:50:36,400
...Damini Rizvi Roy
from Investigator.com.

353
04:50:36,480 --> 04:50:39,960
For her scathing expose
on troll factories.

354
04:50:43,520 --> 04:50:44,840
Few words, Damini.

355
04:50:50,440 --> 04:50:52,360
Fearless Journalist award.

356
04:50:52,840 --> 04:50:55,200
You know, the first time
I won this award,

357
04:50:55,280 --> 04:50:57,720
I felt as if I had
conquered the world.

358
04:50:57,800 --> 04:51:00,440
Then I got it a second time
and a third time.

359
04:51:01,760 --> 04:51:04,520
It was like a rush that
I was addicted to.

360
04:51:05,240 --> 04:51:08,560
To win it, I would work relentlessly
through the year.

361
04:51:10,920 --> 04:51:12,080
But today...

362
04:51:12,840 --> 04:51:16,040
...as I stand here holding
this for the fourth time...

363
04:51:18,280 --> 04:51:19,600
...it feels...

364
04:51:21,080 --> 04:51:22,560
...meaningless to me.

365
04:51:22,640 --> 04:51:26,000
I stand here for a story that I wrote.

366
04:51:26,200 --> 04:51:27,720
Ironically enough...

367
04:51:28,480 --> 04:51:31,360
...I was removed from a
news organization I founded...

368
04:51:31,440 --> 04:51:34,280
...for writing the very same story.

369
04:51:35,000 --> 04:51:36,960
So then, what do these
awards really mean?

370
04:51:37,960 --> 04:51:39,560
When all of us...

371
04:51:40,640 --> 04:51:42,440
...have been reduced to
mere puppets...

372
04:51:42,720 --> 04:51:46,400
...who do anything for ratings
and advertising revenues.

373
04:51:46,480 --> 04:51:48,680
And moving along...
-I'm not done yet.

374
04:51:49,320 --> 04:51:51,560
These foreign junkets, bonuses,

375
04:51:52,000 --> 04:51:54,720
the free lunches,
will all come to an end.

376
04:51:54,800 --> 04:51:57,400
The only thing that stays...

377
04:51:58,080 --> 04:52:00,080
...is good journalism.

378
04:52:00,800 --> 04:52:02,880
Don't let them take away
your integrity.

379
04:52:03,800 --> 04:52:05,320
Don't sell out.

380
04:52:05,560 --> 04:52:06,720
Because then,

381
04:52:07,200 --> 04:52:08,320
shame on us.

382
04:52:10,320 --> 04:52:11,440
Shame on us.

383
04:52:11,520 --> 04:52:13,800
And now it's time for our next award...
-Yes.

384
04:52:13,880 --> 04:52:15,200
It is indeed...

385
04:52:16,240 --> 04:52:17,480
...time.

386
04:52:19,920 --> 04:52:20,720
You can have this.

387
04:52:20,800 --> 04:52:21,640
I'm done.

388
04:52:26,480 --> 04:52:27,280
Arya!

389
04:52:27,320 --> 04:52:29,080
Arya, please stay awake!
Please stay awake baby!

390
04:52:29,160 --> 04:52:30,960
Please! We're almost there, okay!

391
04:52:31,640 --> 04:52:33,800
C'mon! Please go!

392
04:52:35,520 --> 04:52:37,240
Arya, please stay awake!
Please stay awake!

393
04:52:37,400 --> 04:52:38,240
Arya!

394
04:52:38,680 --> 04:52:39,800
Arya!

395
04:53:22,080 --> 04:53:23,560
The number you have dialled...

396
04:53:32,240 --> 04:53:33,520
Please stop calling me.

397
04:53:34,080 --> 04:53:36,080
Samara, please!

398
04:53:36,160 --> 04:53:37,680
I'm leaving for Koh Samui tonight...

399
04:53:37,720 --> 04:53:39,240
...for my last schedule.

400
04:53:39,560 --> 04:53:41,160
Don't ever call me again.

401
04:53:41,240 --> 04:53:42,320
Please, Umang.

402
04:53:54,200 --> 04:53:55,080
Careful.

403
04:53:55,080 --> 04:53:57,280
Just...just two minutes baby, okay?

404
04:53:57,320 --> 04:53:58,560
You'll be fine in no time.

405
04:53:58,640 --> 04:54:00,320
Then we'll go get an
ice cream, okay?

406
04:54:00,440 --> 04:54:01,440
Arya!

407
04:54:01,520 --> 04:54:02,240
Dadda...

408
04:54:02,280 --> 04:54:04,520
Hi, baby...

409
04:54:04,800 --> 04:54:06,560
Hi, my sweetheart...

410
04:54:06,720 --> 04:54:08,160
Are you okay?

411
04:54:08,320 --> 04:54:09,400
Hi, my little one...

412
04:54:09,480 --> 04:54:11,440
What the fuck ya!

413
04:54:11,640 --> 04:54:13,040
What if something happened
to Arya?

414
04:54:13,080 --> 04:54:15,800
I had to drive her because
you had the car.

415
04:54:15,880 --> 04:54:16,760
You could've taken a cab.

416
04:54:16,800 --> 04:54:18,280
You should say this to Kavya!

417
04:54:18,320 --> 04:54:20,320
She let Arya's temperature rise
to a hundred and five...

418
04:54:20,320 --> 04:54:21,080
...waiting for your damn car.

419
04:54:21,200 --> 04:54:23,240
You're the mother, Anjana!

420
04:54:23,320 --> 04:54:24,320
But you're too busy...

421
04:54:24,320 --> 04:54:25,760
...getting sloshed with your buddies!
-Yes!

422
04:54:25,800 --> 04:54:27,680
Because I thought
my daughter was safe.

423
04:54:27,760 --> 04:54:29,480
You need help, you know.

424
04:54:29,560 --> 04:54:30,880
You've completely lost your mind.

425
04:54:30,920 --> 04:54:32,040
Really?

426
04:54:32,320 --> 04:54:33,080
And who are you?

427
04:54:33,160 --> 04:54:34,160
Father of the year?

428
04:54:34,560 --> 04:54:36,080
Where's the Anj I know?

429
04:54:36,680 --> 04:54:39,480
You used to be the most
responsible person.

430
04:54:39,560 --> 04:54:40,280
And now...

431
04:54:40,480 --> 04:54:42,000
You're drinking all the time.

432
04:54:42,080 --> 04:54:42,800
Drunk driving.

433
04:54:42,800 --> 04:54:45,080
Hanging out with some moron
who's half your age!

434
04:54:45,200 --> 04:54:46,080
What else are you into?

435
04:54:46,080 --> 04:54:47,400
Drugs?

436
04:54:47,480 --> 04:54:51,320
Do you even love our child any more?
-She is my life, Varun.

437
04:54:52,240 --> 04:54:53,560
You know what...

438
04:54:54,560 --> 04:54:55,880
...I've decided.

439
04:54:56,960 --> 04:54:59,280
We're moving to Bangalore
and Arya's coming with us.

440
04:54:59,320 --> 04:55:00,400
What?

441
04:55:00,480 --> 04:55:03,560
Kavya's father offered me
a job in his ad agency.

442
04:55:03,640 --> 04:55:06,080
At first, I thought maybe
we'll chat about joint custody.

443
04:55:06,160 --> 04:55:07,560
But after seeing this shit, no way.

444
04:55:07,560 --> 04:55:08,640
I want full custody.

445
04:55:08,720 --> 04:55:10,040
Have you fucking lost it?

446
04:55:10,080 --> 04:55:12,080
You are an unfit mother.

447
04:55:16,640 --> 04:55:18,000
Where were you guys?

448
04:55:18,240 --> 04:55:19,400
Arya's feeling much better.

449
04:55:19,440 --> 04:55:21,080
Her fever's reduced.

450
04:55:22,400 --> 04:55:24,880
"You know, sometimes I wish...

451
04:55:25,000 --> 04:55:27,960
...I was Arya's aunt.

452
04:55:28,040 --> 04:55:29,160
Not mother."

453
04:55:30,040 --> 04:55:30,960
Isn't that what you said?

454
04:55:31,040 --> 04:55:32,800
That's what she said, no baby?

455
04:55:34,560 --> 04:55:36,880
You pretended to be my friend.

456
04:55:37,800 --> 04:55:40,320
I said this to you in confidence, Kavya...

457
04:55:40,320 --> 04:55:41,960
...and you're using it against me?

458
04:55:42,040 --> 04:55:43,640
No, I didn't mean it like that.

459
04:55:43,720 --> 04:55:45,240
Varun, that is out of context.

460
04:55:45,280 --> 04:55:46,320
You...you can't just...

461
04:55:46,400 --> 04:55:48,000
No, you can't!

462
04:55:48,200 --> 04:55:50,400
You can't steal my family!

463
04:55:50,880 --> 04:55:51,880
Have your own child!

464
04:55:51,920 --> 04:55:53,280
Stay away from my daughter!

465
04:55:53,680 --> 04:55:54,400
Anjana,

466
04:55:54,760 --> 04:55:56,520
just calm down.

467
04:55:56,560 --> 04:55:57,040
Please.

468
04:55:57,080 --> 04:55:58,720
Arya is my daughter!

469
04:55:58,800 --> 04:56:00,720
She is my life!

470
04:56:01,320 --> 04:56:03,480
And she will stay with me!

471
04:56:09,800 --> 04:56:10,720
Samara! Samara!

472
04:56:10,800 --> 04:56:12,440
Who is your mystery lover?

473
04:56:12,520 --> 04:56:15,400
Did you leave Raghuveer
Singh for this woman?

474
04:56:15,480 --> 04:56:17,400
Samara, how long have you
been a lesbian?

475
04:56:17,440 --> 04:56:19,040
No comments, thank you.

476
04:56:19,200 --> 04:56:22,080
Ma'am! Ma'am!
-Ma'am, please comment!

477
04:56:27,520 --> 04:56:28,640
Taxi!

478
04:56:44,720 --> 04:56:45,680
Damini?

479
04:56:46,080 --> 04:56:46,920
Look.

480
04:56:47,800 --> 04:56:50,040
I don't know what this is
between us, okay, but...

481
04:56:50,920 --> 04:56:52,480
...that day in Goa when...

482
04:56:53,040 --> 04:56:55,320
...when we were
counting tiles together?

483
04:56:55,400 --> 04:56:57,440
...I realized that no matter
what the situation,

484
04:56:57,440 --> 04:56:58,240
you...

485
04:56:59,120 --> 04:57:00,880
...you just sort me out.

486
04:57:01,480 --> 04:57:01,960
Damini...

487
04:57:02,000 --> 04:57:03,160
I feel good with you.

488
04:57:03,240 --> 04:57:05,880
I feel better than good.
I feel fucking great and...

489
04:57:06,600 --> 04:57:08,040
...and I can be myself with you,
you know.

490
04:57:08,120 --> 04:57:08,920
With all my...

491
04:57:09,000 --> 04:57:10,040
...quirks and...

492
04:57:10,080 --> 04:57:11,960
...and my OCD shit and...

493
04:57:12,280 --> 04:57:16,360
And you're funny and
kind and generous and...

494
04:57:17,200 --> 04:57:18,960
...and the sex, I mean.

495
04:57:19,040 --> 04:57:20,800
The sex, c'mon, it's...

496
04:57:21,000 --> 04:57:23,520
Sometimes it's too good
to be true, right?

497
04:57:23,840 --> 04:57:25,880
And you brought Xerxes
into my life.

498
04:57:26,040 --> 04:57:27,000
Damini...

499
04:57:27,320 --> 04:57:29,320
Do you know what the highlight
of my day is?

500
04:57:30,280 --> 04:57:32,640
Staying back for that
extra drink with you.

501
04:57:32,800 --> 04:57:33,640
Damini...

502
04:57:33,880 --> 04:57:34,960
Jeh Wadia...

503
04:57:35,560 --> 04:57:37,320
All I'm trying to say is that...

504
04:57:38,400 --> 04:57:40,240
...I want to make this work.

505
04:57:40,320 --> 04:57:41,440
I really,

506
04:57:41,760 --> 04:57:43,960
really fucking do, okay?

507
04:57:57,600 --> 04:57:58,680
What are you doing?

508
04:57:59,600 --> 04:58:00,200
What are you...
-Stay away from her.

509
04:58:00,200 --> 04:58:01,840
No, put her on the bed now, Anj...
-No, you stay away from her.

510
04:58:01,840 --> 04:58:03,520
Anj... Anj she's unwell.
-Stay away from her.

511
04:58:03,560 --> 04:58:04,480
Just put her...
-No, I'm taking her home.

512
04:58:04,560 --> 04:58:06,440
I'm taking her home. Leave her.
-No, no, no... you can't do this.

513
04:58:06,520 --> 04:58:08,240
Leave her. She's going with me. No!
-Let her go, Anj...

514
04:58:08,240 --> 04:58:10,800
No! No! No!
-Baby, come here. Come, come...

515
04:58:10,880 --> 04:58:13,320
No! No! No!

516
04:58:13,400 --> 04:58:15,600
Varun, leave her!

517
04:58:15,680 --> 04:58:17,800
Varun, please stop!

518
04:58:17,880 --> 04:58:19,480
Varun, please!
-You're scaring her.

519
04:58:19,560 --> 04:58:21,160
Varun, please no!
-Leave her!

520
04:58:21,240 --> 04:58:22,400
I said leave her!

521
04:58:23,160 --> 04:58:24,520
Why don't you understand!
She's her mother!

522
04:58:24,600 --> 04:58:25,560
Please stop him, Arjun!

523
04:58:25,560 --> 04:58:26,960
They're taking my baby away!

524
04:58:27,000 --> 04:58:28,000
Stop!

525
04:58:30,360 --> 04:58:31,560
No!

526
04:58:49,400 --> 04:58:50,680
Papa...

527
04:58:51,560 --> 04:58:52,520
What is this?

528
04:58:52,840 --> 04:58:54,000
Who are you?

529
04:58:54,400 --> 04:58:55,440
Papa...

530
04:59:01,920 --> 04:59:03,280
Siddhi.

531
04:59:31,640 --> 04:59:33,920
Oh, my God, Jeh.
Nothing's changed here.

532
04:59:34,000 --> 04:59:35,600
Can we please go home now?

533
04:59:35,680 --> 04:59:37,680
Oh, I didn't realize we had company.

534
04:59:38,040 --> 04:59:39,560
Hi, I'm Myra.

535
04:59:50,520 --> 04:59:51,880
Sorry.
