1
02:55:27,480 --> 02:55:30,520
They say the universe fights
for souls to be together.

2
02:55:30,560 --> 02:55:33,360
Somethings are so strange
and yet powerful that...

3
02:55:33,400 --> 02:55:35,480
...you cannot call them
a co-incidence.

4
02:55:35,560 --> 02:55:37,280
And I've begun to agree.

5
02:56:33,840 --> 02:56:35,360
Good morning beautiful!

6
02:56:37,920 --> 02:56:38,720
Oops.

7
02:56:48,640 --> 02:56:50,040
Fuck.

8
02:57:37,760 --> 02:57:40,440
Surprise!
-Surprise!

9
02:57:41,160 --> 02:57:42,160
What the fuck!

10
02:57:42,280 --> 02:57:43,520
I baked you a cake!

11
02:57:43,600 --> 02:57:46,440
Happy birthday to you!
-Happy birthday to you!

12
02:57:46,720 --> 02:57:49,520
Happy birthday to you!
-My birthday isn't till day
after...

13
02:57:49,560 --> 02:57:50,520
...you freaks!

14
02:57:51,120 --> 02:57:54,040
Happy birthday dear Dee!
-Are you guys insane?

15
02:57:54,160 --> 02:57:55,880
I really thought
I was going to die in there!

16
02:57:56,160 --> 02:57:58,080
At the rate you're working,
yes you will die.

17
02:57:58,320 --> 02:58:00,760
Dee...we're kidnapping you
from yourself.

18
02:58:01,440 --> 02:58:03,840
So deep ya...so deep!
-So deep bro...

19
02:58:04,160 --> 02:58:05,960
We're taking you to Goa bro.

20
02:58:06,040 --> 02:58:07,960
And we've packed some
clothes in for you, so chill.

21
02:58:08,040 --> 02:58:09,160
And by the way,

22
02:58:09,240 --> 02:58:11,600
I've got front row passes to
the Arambol Festival.

23
02:58:11,920 --> 02:58:13,120
And who the fuck are you?

24
02:58:13,200 --> 02:58:13,800
Oh Mohit, Dee...

25
02:58:13,920 --> 02:58:15,040
Dee, Mohit...
-Hi Dee!

26
02:58:15,520 --> 02:58:16,200
And you're welcome.

27
02:58:16,320 --> 02:58:16,840
For what?

28
02:58:16,880 --> 02:58:17,800
Giving me a heart attack?

29
02:58:17,920 --> 02:58:19,320
I'm going to really kill
you guys, you know!

30
02:58:19,360 --> 02:58:19,960
Throw that damn...
-No! No!

31
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:21,400
Okay, okay! Just chill!
-No, don't. Don't touch my cake.

32
02:58:21,640 --> 02:58:24,200
Happy birthday to you!
-Happy birthday to you!

33
02:58:24,280 --> 02:58:24,880
Can we go?

34
02:58:25,000 --> 02:58:27,480
Happy birthday to you!
-Happy birthday to you!

35
02:58:27,960 --> 02:58:32,240
Happy birthday dear Damini...
-Happy birthday dear Damini...

36
02:58:32,400 --> 02:58:33,640
Happy birthday to you.
-Happy birthday to you.

37
02:59:19,120 --> 02:59:21,280
Obviously, they'll keep a
hawk-eye on you.

38
02:59:22,160 --> 02:59:23,680
You please keep in
touch, okay?

39
02:59:23,880 --> 02:59:25,280
Ya, I'm available 24/7.

40
02:59:25,920 --> 02:59:27,120
Fucking network!

41
02:59:28,800 --> 02:59:30,240
I can't hear...
-Are you thinking what I'm
thinking?

42
02:59:30,880 --> 02:59:32,480
ZNMD!
-ZNMD!

43
02:59:32,960 --> 02:59:34,360
Siddhi, what the hell!

44
02:59:34,800 --> 02:59:36,120
What!
-Guys, quiet ya!

45
02:59:36,200 --> 02:59:37,200
Please! Quiet!

46
02:59:38,240 --> 02:59:39,240
Siddhi, stop it!

47
02:59:39,280 --> 02:59:42,040
Sids, stop it please!
-What are you doing?

48
02:59:42,640 --> 02:59:43,240
What?!

49
02:59:43,600 --> 02:59:44,800
What?!
-Oh!

50
02:59:45,080 --> 02:59:45,640
Guys!

51
02:59:45,920 --> 02:59:46,640
Stop the car!

52
02:59:46,800 --> 02:59:48,160
Umang, stop the car!

53
02:59:57,880 --> 02:59:58,680
Is this supposed to be funny?

54
02:59:59,600 --> 03:00:00,640
You think it's funny?

55
03:00:00,800 --> 03:00:01,880
Siddhi, give me your phone.

56
03:00:02,360 --> 03:00:03,800
This is for your own good, Dee.

57
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:05,160
It's my birthday weekend!

58
03:00:05,200 --> 03:00:06,200
Hand it over! Please!

59
03:00:07,120 --> 03:00:08,360
I'll put my sim in
your phone.

60
03:00:08,560 --> 03:00:09,200
Give!

61
03:00:09,320 --> 03:00:10,040
Giving!

62
03:00:10,920 --> 03:00:12,120
And what'll I do?

63
03:00:12,720 --> 03:00:13,920
Have a phone free weekend.

64
03:00:14,160 --> 03:00:15,800
Besides, the only people
you know are...

65
03:00:16,160 --> 03:00:17,200
...right here in this car.

66
03:00:17,560 --> 03:00:18,080
Dee!

67
03:00:18,720 --> 03:00:20,160
Dee, that's really mean.

68
03:00:21,440 --> 03:00:22,680
Okay, I didn't mean it
like that.

69
03:00:22,760 --> 03:00:23,240
Sids!

70
03:00:24,760 --> 03:00:25,560
No, you're right.

71
03:00:25,680 --> 03:00:27,520
I'm unemployed,
unambitious.

72
03:00:28,200 --> 03:00:30,240
And I have just one goal
in life.

73
03:00:30,240 --> 03:00:31,000
Finding a husband.

74
03:00:31,240 --> 03:00:32,320
But I love my life.
-Sid...

75
03:00:32,880 --> 03:00:34,480
Even though you think
I shouldn't.

76
03:00:36,120 --> 03:00:37,520
Siddhi, you know I love you.

77
03:00:37,560 --> 03:00:38,800
I'm fine, really.

78
03:00:38,880 --> 03:00:40,160
Really, I'm fine.
-Oh...

79
03:00:40,200 --> 03:00:41,320
Awww...
-Oh!

80
03:00:41,440 --> 03:00:42,800
We love you Siddhi Patel!

81
03:00:43,240 --> 03:00:45,120
Siddhi, we love you!

82
03:01:00,800 --> 03:01:02,720
Sids, give me my phone.
-No.

83
03:01:03,400 --> 03:01:05,720
Something urgent's come up.
I'll be right back.

84
03:01:06,320 --> 03:01:07,680
Hey! What! Mangs!

85
03:01:18,880 --> 03:01:19,920
Housekeeping.

86
03:01:24,880 --> 03:01:25,920
Surprise!

87
03:01:26,080 --> 03:01:26,960
Oh my God!

88
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:28,560
You gorgeous idiot!

89
03:01:36,120 --> 03:01:38,200
Now today we have to
shoot the final...

90
03:01:38,840 --> 03:01:40,680
...training tournament montage.

91
03:01:42,080 --> 03:01:44,320
My fest won't start
for another three hours.

92
03:01:44,560 --> 03:01:45,320
Can I come?

93
03:01:46,600 --> 03:01:49,320
Hired a big time American
stunt co-ordinator.

94
03:01:50,680 --> 03:01:51,760
He probably won't like it.

95
03:01:52,040 --> 03:01:53,320
Besides, you should chill,
you know.

96
03:01:53,440 --> 03:01:55,040
Stay here.
Go to the spa.

97
03:01:55,080 --> 03:01:55,920
Room service.

98
03:01:56,040 --> 03:01:56,680
Pool.

99
03:01:57,000 --> 03:01:58,400
Just pamper yourself.

100
03:01:59,120 --> 03:02:00,560
But I've never seen a
shoot in my life.

101
03:02:00,640 --> 03:02:02,400
I would really like
to see you in action.

102
03:02:02,600 --> 03:02:04,120
But you always see me
in action babe.

103
03:02:04,480 --> 03:02:05,760
You know what I mean.

104
03:02:06,440 --> 03:02:07,920
Anyways, if you come to set,

105
03:02:08,520 --> 03:02:10,280
I won't be able to concentrate.

106
03:02:19,640 --> 03:02:22,600
What are we eating for
breakfast?
-Bottoms up ladies!

107
03:02:22,760 --> 03:02:24,520
Whoa!
-Mohit, it's 11 o'clock in the
morning.

108
03:02:24,720 --> 03:02:26,240
Which is why the tomato
juice chaser.

109
03:02:26,280 --> 03:02:27,240
Healthy breakfast and all!

110
03:02:27,440 --> 03:02:29,800
Nonsense!
-Nonsense!

111
03:02:29,960 --> 03:02:30,840
Okay, let's go for it.
-C'mon...

112
03:02:31,000 --> 03:02:33,800
Mangs! Where've you been?
-Where were you?

113
03:02:34,720 --> 03:02:37,160
Happy birthday weekend
Damini!

114
03:02:37,280 --> 03:02:40,720
Happy birthday Damini!
-Happy birthday!

115
03:03:09,040 --> 03:03:10,680
From 'Don't kiss me,
I'm prudish' to...

116
03:03:10,800 --> 03:03:13,120
...'whip-lady Dominatrix'
in one month?

117
03:03:13,240 --> 03:03:13,920
Siddhi!

118
03:03:14,640 --> 03:03:15,640
Mohit...

119
03:03:15,920 --> 03:03:18,120
I just can't describe it to you.

120
03:03:18,640 --> 03:03:21,280
You know, for the first time
in my life I feel...

121
03:03:21,560 --> 03:03:22,600
I feel free.

122
03:03:23,760 --> 03:03:25,280
I have started liking
my body.

123
03:03:25,360 --> 03:03:26,000
Infact...

124
03:03:26,240 --> 03:03:26,800
I love it!

125
03:03:26,920 --> 03:03:27,640
Enough. Please.

126
03:03:27,720 --> 03:03:29,040
I charge for these
shrink sessions.

127
03:03:29,240 --> 03:03:30,360
You'll have to buy me
vodka shots.

128
03:03:30,720 --> 03:03:31,120
C'mon.

129
03:03:32,480 --> 03:03:33,520
C'mon Dominatrix.

130
03:04:04,520 --> 03:04:07,080
Madam, the concert is
on that side.

131
03:04:07,440 --> 03:04:08,640
C'mon, get up!
-Oh shit.

132
03:04:11,440 --> 03:04:12,520
Oh shit!

133
03:04:13,040 --> 03:04:14,440
You guys! Get up!

134
03:04:14,480 --> 03:04:15,520
We're so late!

135
03:04:15,640 --> 03:04:16,760
What?
-Get up guys!

136
03:04:16,840 --> 03:04:18,600
C'mon ya...
-Oh my God!

137
03:04:18,640 --> 03:04:19,640
What!

138
03:04:26,960 --> 03:04:27,880
10...

139
03:04:28,840 --> 03:04:29,760
9...

140
03:04:30,760 --> 03:04:31,640
8...

141
03:04:32,600 --> 03:04:33,520
7...

142
03:04:34,520 --> 03:04:39,160
6... 5... 4... 3... 2...

143
03:04:39,320 --> 03:04:41,360
Are you ready!

144
03:04:51,400 --> 03:04:53,160
I can't see anything!

145
03:04:54,520 --> 03:04:56,000
What is happening!
-My head is spinning!

146
03:04:56,080 --> 03:04:56,760
Relax!

147
03:04:56,880 --> 03:04:58,040
It's not a Coldplay concert.

148
03:04:58,320 --> 03:04:59,320
Enjoy the ambience!

149
03:05:00,160 --> 03:05:02,640
Did you kidnap me to
show me this ambience?

150
03:05:02,760 --> 03:05:03,400
Beach,

151
03:05:03,760 --> 03:05:04,480
two hundred meters.

152
03:05:04,760 --> 03:05:05,880
Booze, fifty meters.

153
03:05:06,120 --> 03:05:08,360
Hot guy, 10 o'clock, 3 o'clock.
5 o'clock!

154
03:05:08,760 --> 03:05:09,640
Fair enough!

155
03:05:10,480 --> 03:05:11,320
Guys, fuck this.

156
03:05:11,520 --> 03:05:12,240
I need a drink.

157
03:05:12,320 --> 03:05:13,240
Anyone needs a drink?

158
03:05:14,280 --> 03:05:14,640
Fine.

159
03:05:14,760 --> 03:05:15,480
Sissies.

160
03:05:15,960 --> 03:05:16,880
Excuse me please.

161
03:05:27,320 --> 03:05:28,640
Hey bartender!

162
03:05:31,360 --> 03:05:32,600
Hey Ms Menon!

163
03:05:33,640 --> 03:05:34,880
Oh my God!

164
03:05:34,960 --> 03:05:36,120
Arjun! What...

165
03:05:36,320 --> 03:05:37,640
What're you doing here?

166
03:05:38,520 --> 03:05:39,880
What're you doing here?

167
03:05:40,120 --> 03:05:41,200
Are you stalking me?

168
03:05:41,520 --> 03:05:42,160
Sure.

169
03:05:43,640 --> 03:05:44,280
Need help?

170
03:05:44,880 --> 03:05:45,520
No, thanks.

171
03:05:45,760 --> 03:05:47,600
I've been to thousands
of concerts.

172
03:05:47,840 --> 03:05:49,240
I wasn't always like this.

173
03:05:49,440 --> 03:05:51,040
A lawyer, a boss.

174
03:05:51,120 --> 03:05:52,280
A 'Ms Menon'.

175
03:05:52,360 --> 03:05:53,480
Ya, okay.

176
03:05:53,720 --> 03:05:54,640
Excuse me!

177
03:05:55,080 --> 03:05:55,760
Excuse...

178
03:05:57,240 --> 03:05:58,160
Oh God!

179
03:05:58,280 --> 03:05:58,880
Fuck this shit.

180
03:05:58,880 --> 03:05:59,520
I'm going.

181
03:06:01,760 --> 03:06:02,960
A little help please?

182
03:06:03,280 --> 03:06:04,280
Up! Up! Up!

183
03:06:05,480 --> 03:06:06,480
There you are.

184
03:06:06,640 --> 03:06:08,840
Four G&T's and one beer.

185
03:06:09,320 --> 03:06:10,160
What do you guys want?

186
03:06:10,280 --> 03:06:11,280
Four vodka reds.

187
03:06:12,160 --> 03:06:12,760
Kids.

188
03:06:13,160 --> 03:06:14,520
Four vodka reds please.

189
03:06:17,000 --> 03:06:17,960
Here, hold this.

190
03:06:18,320 --> 03:06:21,080
Our generation can do
things themselves.

191
03:06:21,400 --> 03:06:22,320
Well...
-Keep it there please.

192
03:06:22,400 --> 03:06:24,080
Technically, we're the
same generation.

193
03:06:42,400 --> 03:06:43,280
Seriously...

194
03:06:43,800 --> 03:06:44,840
We're both millennials.

195
03:06:46,200 --> 03:06:47,440
You're a kid...

196
03:06:47,680 --> 03:06:48,800
...and I'm a woman.

197
03:06:49,120 --> 03:06:50,080
That's that.
-Damn.

198
03:06:51,240 --> 03:06:52,000
You know because...

199
03:06:52,040 --> 03:06:54,600
...I thought I became a man
when my balls dropped.

200
03:06:57,040 --> 03:06:57,840
Made you look.

201
03:06:58,760 --> 03:07:00,560
See, you're still a kid.

202
03:07:01,880 --> 03:07:02,640
Well...

203
03:07:03,200 --> 03:07:04,920
This kid is at your service.

204
03:07:05,120 --> 03:07:06,160
Whenever you want.

205
03:07:06,560 --> 03:07:07,320
Ms Menon.

206
03:07:22,080 --> 03:07:24,000
Hey, there you are!
Guys! Guys!

207
03:07:24,120 --> 03:07:24,920
Drinks!

208
03:07:25,040 --> 03:07:26,720
Thank you!
-Yay!

209
03:07:27,240 --> 03:07:28,480
Hi!

210
03:07:28,880 --> 03:07:30,600
Where have you been
all my life?

211
03:07:31,760 --> 03:07:32,520
Drinking beer.

212
03:07:32,560 --> 03:07:33,640
Playing video games.

213
03:07:33,800 --> 03:07:34,600
So straight.

214
03:07:34,800 --> 03:07:37,400
It's my birthday and Anj is
getting personalized service?

215
03:07:37,560 --> 03:07:38,800
Guys, he's Arjun.

216
03:07:38,960 --> 03:07:40,080
He's my intern.

217
03:07:40,280 --> 03:07:41,720
Just like that movie!

218
03:07:41,800 --> 03:07:43,200
The Graduate?
With that old lady?

219
03:07:43,280 --> 03:07:44,000
Shut up!

220
03:07:44,200 --> 03:07:44,960
No, no, no...

221
03:07:45,000 --> 03:07:46,520
That one...The Proposal.

222
03:07:47,280 --> 03:07:48,400
Hot young intern,

223
03:07:48,440 --> 03:07:49,640
older female boss.

224
03:07:49,720 --> 03:07:50,040
What?

225
03:07:50,080 --> 03:07:53,000
He murders her because
she's a horrible boss?

226
03:07:53,320 --> 03:07:54,440
No, actually...

227
03:07:54,720 --> 03:07:56,080
...they sleep together!

228
03:07:56,280 --> 03:07:59,040
Oh!

229
03:07:59,440 --> 03:08:00,640
I think I should leave.

230
03:08:01,000 --> 03:08:02,040
It was great to meet
you guys.

231
03:08:02,160 --> 03:08:03,680
It was lovely meeting
you too!

232
03:08:03,880 --> 03:08:04,560
Stalker.

233
03:08:08,800 --> 03:08:10,080
Thank you Sids!

234
03:08:10,560 --> 03:08:12,160
Love you too!
Love you too!

235
03:08:12,320 --> 03:08:14,680
I think Ms VeeVee's
about to wake up!

236
03:08:15,160 --> 03:08:17,800
Whoo!
-Whoo!

237
03:08:17,960 --> 03:08:19,640
Guys! Guys!

238
03:08:19,680 --> 03:08:20,920
He's a kid.

239
03:08:21,120 --> 03:08:21,800
Can I have him?

240
03:08:21,840 --> 03:08:22,880
For me, age no bar.

241
03:08:23,200 --> 03:08:25,280
Anj, he totally gave you
the look.

242
03:08:25,360 --> 03:08:27,320
So time to say bye
to Varun.

243
03:08:27,360 --> 03:08:29,000
For good!

244
03:08:29,160 --> 03:08:29,880
Hey rebound!

245
03:08:30,040 --> 03:08:30,760
Rebound!
-Rebound!

246
03:08:30,840 --> 03:08:32,760
Rebound!
-Rebound!

247
03:08:32,800 --> 03:08:33,880
Please shut up!
-Rebound!

248
03:08:33,920 --> 03:08:35,280
Rebound!

249
03:08:35,360 --> 03:08:36,440
Just shut up!
-Rebound!

250
03:08:37,800 --> 03:08:38,440
Hello?

251
03:08:38,520 --> 03:08:39,920
Rebound!
-Shut up guys.

252
03:08:39,960 --> 03:08:40,960
Rebound!

253
03:08:41,000 --> 03:08:42,800
No! Please!
-Yes, this is Damini...

254
03:08:43,080 --> 03:08:43,960
Please!

255
03:08:44,000 --> 03:08:44,920
Shut up!

256
03:08:44,960 --> 03:08:45,520
Excuse me?

257
03:08:45,560 --> 03:08:47,560
Rebound!

258
03:08:47,720 --> 03:08:49,720
I'm not listening. Bye!
-Rebound!

259
03:08:49,760 --> 03:08:52,200
Rebound!

260
03:08:52,240 --> 03:08:53,600
Whoo!

261
03:08:54,160 --> 03:08:55,800
These guys don't waste
any time.

262
03:08:56,040 --> 03:08:57,000
Fucking assholes!

263
03:08:57,120 --> 03:08:57,600
Fuck!

264
03:08:59,440 --> 03:09:00,240
Fuck!

265
03:09:00,400 --> 03:09:01,960
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

266
03:09:02,800 --> 03:09:03,800
Fuck! Fuck!

267
03:09:03,920 --> 03:09:04,880
Om Shanti.

268
03:09:05,680 --> 03:09:06,520
Fuck Shanti!

269
03:09:08,040 --> 03:09:10,280
A little something
to release your tension.

270
03:09:10,840 --> 03:09:12,000
If you want more,

271
03:09:12,240 --> 03:09:12,840
call me.

272
03:09:25,760 --> 03:09:26,600
Give me that.

273
03:09:27,640 --> 03:09:28,720
Hey! What the fuck!

274
03:09:31,920 --> 03:09:33,320
First Anjana disappeared.

275
03:09:33,400 --> 03:09:34,360
Now Dee.

276
03:09:34,480 --> 03:09:36,080
Everyone knows
where the hotel is.

277
03:09:36,120 --> 03:09:37,240
Just chill!

278
03:09:37,400 --> 03:09:38,640
Look! There's our peeps!

279
03:09:38,680 --> 03:09:41,080
Our people, our country!

280
03:09:52,040 --> 03:09:52,640
Mohit!

281
03:09:52,760 --> 03:09:54,720
You told me there'll
be cute guys here for me!

282
03:09:54,840 --> 03:09:55,960
Beer, beer...

283
03:09:56,520 --> 03:09:57,200
Cheers!

284
03:10:36,720 --> 03:10:38,200
Siddi-Piddi!

285
03:10:42,000 --> 03:10:43,160
Mihu-Pihu?

286
03:10:43,520 --> 03:10:44,320
Oh fuck!

287
03:10:44,360 --> 03:10:46,840
What a small world man!

288
03:10:50,040 --> 03:10:50,640
Shit!

289
03:10:51,520 --> 03:10:53,880
I'm so sorry! I'm really sorry!
-Relax.

290
03:10:54,800 --> 03:10:55,720
I know what you need.

291
03:11:00,400 --> 03:11:02,000
Cold, cold water!

292
03:11:04,400 --> 03:11:06,160
It feels so good!

293
03:11:06,640 --> 03:11:10,240
Siddi-Piddi and Mihu-Pihu
together in Goa.

294
03:11:10,800 --> 03:11:11,680
Who would've thought?

295
03:11:12,360 --> 03:11:13,160
Ya dude!

296
03:11:14,720 --> 03:11:15,600
What are you doing here?

297
03:11:15,680 --> 03:11:17,000
Weren't you in New York?

298
03:11:17,120 --> 03:11:18,800
Yes but I came back
two days ago...

299
03:11:18,880 --> 03:11:20,920
...and I came straight
to Goa.

300
03:11:21,760 --> 03:11:23,280
I can't handle my parents
in India...

301
03:11:23,320 --> 03:11:25,400
...without an easy transition,
you know.

302
03:11:27,520 --> 03:11:29,200
When we were eight
year olds...

303
03:11:29,320 --> 03:11:31,560
...I still remember that you
were
obsessed with water.

304
03:11:32,240 --> 03:11:33,880
You remember that Holi?

305
03:11:33,920 --> 03:11:34,840
When you did...

306
03:11:34,920 --> 03:11:35,400
...this?

307
03:11:35,480 --> 03:11:36,360
Siddhi!

308
03:11:36,920 --> 03:11:37,640
Siddhi!

309
03:11:39,800 --> 03:11:40,480
Take that!

310
03:11:43,640 --> 03:11:44,440
Want more?

311
03:12:23,160 --> 03:12:24,440
Get lost.

312
03:12:24,480 --> 03:12:25,520
Fucking...

313
03:12:26,080 --> 03:12:27,160
...asshole.

314
03:12:31,960 --> 03:12:33,560
Two words.

315
03:12:34,400 --> 03:12:35,640
Fuck off.

316
03:12:40,400 --> 03:12:41,960
Fucking assholes!

317
03:12:42,920 --> 03:12:45,160
Think I'll drop the
story through intimidation.

318
03:12:46,000 --> 03:12:47,480
I will show them!

319
03:12:53,480 --> 03:12:54,720
Water please!

320
03:12:55,520 --> 03:12:57,000
Excuse me!

321
03:13:01,320 --> 03:13:03,320
Is one fucking bottle
of water...

322
03:13:03,440 --> 03:13:04,880
...too much to ask for!

323
03:13:07,880 --> 03:13:10,480
One bottle of water please...
-No, it's not.

324
03:13:11,880 --> 03:13:12,880
Thanks.

325
03:13:15,680 --> 03:13:17,160
Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

326
03:13:18,400 --> 03:13:19,240
Oops.

327
03:13:22,440 --> 03:13:23,440
Thank you so...
-C'mon!

328
03:13:23,560 --> 03:13:26,560
Spending a few minutes
with someone as beautiful as
you...

329
03:13:26,560 --> 03:13:27,800
...is payment enough.

330
03:13:28,800 --> 03:13:30,720
And may I ask...

331
03:13:30,760 --> 03:13:34,560
...why a beautiful girl like
you is
standing here all by herself?

332
03:13:35,320 --> 03:13:37,160
Your guy's an idiot to
leave you out of his sight...

333
03:13:37,200 --> 03:13:38,160
...even for a minute.

334
03:13:39,240 --> 03:13:40,320
There is no guy.

335
03:13:40,440 --> 03:13:41,800
I'm divorced.

336
03:13:42,480 --> 03:13:43,320
What a co-incidence.

337
03:13:43,480 --> 03:13:44,080
Me too.

338
03:13:45,000 --> 03:13:45,720
I'm Vinil.

339
03:13:46,000 --> 03:13:47,440
I run a hedge fund
in Mumbai.

340
03:13:47,680 --> 03:13:48,440
Hi,

341
03:13:48,520 --> 03:13:49,320
I'm Anjana.

342
03:13:49,480 --> 03:13:50,400
I'm a lawyer.

343
03:13:50,560 --> 03:13:51,280
And...

344
03:13:51,320 --> 03:13:52,520
I'm from Mumbai too.

345
03:13:52,560 --> 03:13:54,000
Legalese and money.

346
03:13:54,280 --> 03:13:55,400
It's like rum and coke.

347
03:13:56,800 --> 03:13:58,520
Speaking of which,
can I get you one?

348
03:14:01,000 --> 03:14:02,320
One G&T please.

349
03:14:03,560 --> 03:14:07,200
"Of all the gin joints,
in all the towns, in all the
world,

350
03:14:07,320 --> 03:14:08,640
she walks into mine."

351
03:14:09,800 --> 03:14:10,800
Casablanca.

352
03:14:18,080 --> 03:14:18,920
Seriously?

353
03:14:19,920 --> 03:14:20,720
This?

354
03:14:20,800 --> 03:14:21,480
Old guy?

355
03:14:21,560 --> 03:14:22,440
With a beard?

356
03:14:23,040 --> 03:14:24,520
Leave me alone.

357
03:14:24,640 --> 03:14:25,720
I'm flirting.

358
03:14:26,200 --> 03:14:27,080
Oh.

359
03:14:27,560 --> 03:14:29,240
And what happened
to the other Anjana?

360
03:14:29,280 --> 03:14:30,040
Who...

361
03:14:30,200 --> 03:14:31,280
...climbs up on the bar...

362
03:14:31,320 --> 03:14:33,400
...and gives me a spiel about
her generation?

363
03:14:34,240 --> 03:14:34,920
You know what,

364
03:14:34,960 --> 03:14:38,080
I met someone who's
older, wiser.

365
03:14:38,240 --> 03:14:39,720
We kind of hit it off...

366
03:14:40,160 --> 03:14:40,880
What's the problem?

367
03:14:41,880 --> 03:14:42,680
Ms Menon,

368
03:14:43,320 --> 03:14:44,240
the problem is...

369
03:14:44,400 --> 03:14:45,440
...you know what you want.

370
03:14:45,960 --> 03:14:47,240
But you don't know
what you need.

371
03:14:51,320 --> 03:14:52,560
And what do I want?

372
03:14:54,480 --> 03:14:56,240
This financial duffer...

373
03:14:56,880 --> 03:15:00,320
...who listens to jazz
while sipping his single malt.

374
03:15:00,560 --> 03:15:02,560
Never misses Sunday
golf and...

375
03:15:02,760 --> 03:15:05,960
...owns a posh apartment
in a high-rise.

376
03:15:06,000 --> 03:15:07,320
He never opens the
windows...

377
03:15:07,440 --> 03:15:10,960
...because 'No ya. Mumbai's
air smells of sea.'

378
03:15:13,320 --> 03:15:14,400
And...

379
03:15:15,720 --> 03:15:16,800
...what do I need?

380
03:15:18,280 --> 03:15:20,640
Someone you can smell
the sea with.

381
03:15:22,480 --> 03:15:24,280
I think you're being
very judgemental.

382
03:15:25,280 --> 03:15:25,800
Oh God.

383
03:15:25,960 --> 03:15:27,280
Okay, how about this.

384
03:15:28,040 --> 03:15:29,800
Imagine what he'll
look like in five years.

385
03:15:31,560 --> 03:15:32,760
And then imagine...

386
03:15:33,080 --> 03:15:34,160
...what you'll look like.

387
03:15:35,920 --> 03:15:37,400
Have you heard of
one night stands?

388
03:15:37,920 --> 03:15:38,720
You can do better.

389
03:15:41,000 --> 03:15:43,560
"To the kingdom far,
far away my queen."

390
03:15:44,440 --> 03:15:45,800
"That's where we should go."

391
03:15:47,560 --> 03:15:50,200
So, Casablanca Vs Shrek.

392
03:15:51,200 --> 03:15:51,960
No brainer.

393
03:15:54,520 --> 03:15:55,200
Let's go.

394
03:16:09,800 --> 03:16:11,920
How are Hetal aunty and
Jayesh uncle?

395
03:16:12,680 --> 03:16:15,480
You know, honestly,
I really don't know.

396
03:16:16,080 --> 03:16:17,720
I mean, because
every time I get here...

397
03:16:17,800 --> 03:16:20,680
...they're like marriage,
marriage, marriage.

398
03:16:21,080 --> 03:16:22,040
I lose it.

399
03:16:22,080 --> 03:16:23,080
I go to my room.

400
03:16:23,520 --> 03:16:24,640
Rinse and repeat.

401
03:16:26,320 --> 03:16:27,560
Remember that Lonavala trip?

402
03:16:28,760 --> 03:16:30,680
When we filled Sneha's
bed with mango fudge...

403
03:16:30,760 --> 03:16:32,880
...and thought she had a
diarrhea attack!

404
03:16:32,960 --> 03:16:33,880
Jesus!

405
03:16:34,040 --> 03:16:35,760
Wait, you still call
her Sneha?

406
03:16:36,440 --> 03:16:37,400
Ya, I guess...

407
03:16:37,520 --> 03:16:39,240
...somethings never change.

408
03:16:39,440 --> 03:16:40,720
Thank God they don't.

409
03:16:42,040 --> 03:16:42,800
Siddi-Piddi...

410
03:16:44,080 --> 03:16:46,240
Your hair is like...

411
03:16:46,280 --> 03:16:47,680
...a cobweb!

412
03:16:47,920 --> 03:16:49,240
Don't you shampoo?

413
03:16:49,480 --> 03:16:51,000
Mihu-Pihu!
I'll beat you up!

414
03:16:51,400 --> 03:16:52,280
Shit! Fuck!

415
03:16:52,560 --> 03:16:53,640
Sorry, sorry!
-Sorry!

416
03:16:53,720 --> 03:16:54,680
You bloody dog!

417
03:16:54,880 --> 03:16:56,080
What?
-Motherfucker!

418
03:16:56,080 --> 03:16:57,320
Cocksucker!
-Bro...

419
03:16:57,320 --> 03:16:58,200
Take it easy man!

420
03:16:58,240 --> 03:16:58,520
Relax.

421
03:16:58,560 --> 03:16:59,320
Siddhi, just come here
one second.

422
03:16:59,400 --> 03:17:01,200
You ruined my t-shirt asshole!
-Bro...

423
03:17:01,320 --> 03:17:02,560
Bro, I just...
-You going to buy me a new one?

424
03:17:02,560 --> 03:17:04,000
One second idiot.
Shut up!

425
03:17:04,440 --> 03:17:05,320
Is the size of your brain...

426
03:17:05,320 --> 03:17:07,160
...inversely proportional to the
size of your biceps?

427
03:17:07,320 --> 03:17:08,800
If you can't speak civilly...

428
03:17:08,920 --> 03:17:09,960
...then go back to
wherever you came from.

429
03:17:10,000 --> 03:17:10,320
Siddhi just...

430
03:17:10,400 --> 03:17:11,200
You don't have the balls...

431
03:17:11,240 --> 03:17:12,080
...so you're hiding behind
your girlfriend?

432
03:17:12,080 --> 03:17:12,800
No, we're not looking
for a fight.

433
03:17:12,920 --> 03:17:14,280
Where are your balls?

434
03:17:14,320 --> 03:17:16,080
I'm not looking for a fight.
-Stop barking in English!

435
03:17:16,320 --> 03:17:17,680
C'mon bite me you dog!
Bite me!

436
03:17:17,720 --> 03:17:18,400
Oh!

437
03:17:20,440 --> 03:17:21,000
Oh shit!

438
03:17:21,600 --> 03:17:23,800
That was amazing!
-Run!

439
03:17:24,000 --> 03:17:26,040
You bastard!

440
03:17:32,720 --> 03:17:34,280
Siddi-Piddi!

441
03:17:35,960 --> 03:17:37,720
When did you turn into
sexy Siddhi?

442
03:17:38,000 --> 03:17:38,880
That was...

443
03:17:39,160 --> 03:17:40,640
...that was so fucking hot!

444
03:17:46,880 --> 03:17:47,440
I should...

445
03:17:47,480 --> 03:17:48,560
...I should go find
my friends.

446
03:17:48,600 --> 03:17:49,920
Wait, wait...c'mon!

447
03:17:50,400 --> 03:17:52,400
Spend some time with
an old friend?

448
03:17:52,880 --> 03:17:53,760
I have a great idea.

449
03:17:54,280 --> 03:17:54,840
What?

450
03:17:58,240 --> 03:18:01,240
Sings folk song

451
03:18:01,400 --> 03:18:02,640
That folk song?

452
03:18:02,720 --> 03:18:03,680
Oh my God!

453
03:18:03,880 --> 03:18:05,000
The dance festival!

454
03:18:05,080 --> 03:18:07,080
Remember we practiced
the shit out of that routine!

455
03:18:07,120 --> 03:18:08,000
Of course!

456
03:18:08,040 --> 03:18:08,880
And what did we get?

457
03:18:09,000 --> 03:18:10,280
Consolation prize.
-Wait, wait...

458
03:18:10,520 --> 03:18:11,680
At least we got to go to
Bachelors...

459
03:18:11,720 --> 03:18:12,520
...to eat chilli ice cream...

460
03:18:12,600 --> 03:18:13,800
...and drown our sorrows!

461
03:18:13,960 --> 03:18:14,920
Ya!
-Right?

462
03:18:15,280 --> 03:18:37,560
Continues singing folk song

463
03:18:47,800 --> 03:18:50,640
Ashes to ashes...

464
03:18:50,840 --> 03:18:52,280
Dust to dust.

465
03:18:54,880 --> 03:18:56,240
My puppy!

466
03:18:56,560 --> 03:18:58,160
Where are you?

467
03:19:00,200 --> 03:19:01,600
Puppy...

468
03:19:02,720 --> 03:19:05,280
Puppy...

469
03:19:11,240 --> 03:19:12,520
Jeh!

470
03:19:15,600 --> 03:19:16,360
Damini?

471
03:19:17,400 --> 03:19:20,160
I miss Xerxes.

472
03:19:20,960 --> 03:19:23,040
He was such a cute puppy.

473
03:19:23,480 --> 03:19:24,240
He was my....

474
03:19:24,480 --> 03:19:25,320
...friend, you know.

475
03:19:25,400 --> 03:19:26,520
My best friend.

476
03:19:27,280 --> 03:19:27,920
Was?

477
03:19:28,440 --> 03:19:29,600
He's still alive, you know.

478
03:19:29,840 --> 03:19:31,320
Where is he?

479
03:19:32,280 --> 03:19:34,640
I miss his happy face!

480
03:19:34,720 --> 03:19:36,440
Just like the pill!

481
03:19:37,200 --> 03:19:41,480
Puppy is my happy pill!

482
03:19:42,520 --> 03:19:44,120
You can visit him anytime
you want.

483
03:19:44,360 --> 03:19:45,160
Now?

484
03:19:45,520 --> 03:19:46,840
I'm in Goa.

485
03:19:47,280 --> 03:19:47,880
In Goa?

486
03:19:48,440 --> 03:19:49,440
Ya...

487
03:19:50,920 --> 03:19:53,000
But I don't know
where I am...

488
03:19:53,800 --> 03:19:55,120
I had a happy pill...

489
03:19:55,280 --> 03:19:56,360
...just like puppy.

490
03:19:57,560 --> 03:19:59,000
He was so cute!

491
03:19:59,480 --> 03:20:00,640
Damini, Damini!

492
03:20:01,080 --> 03:20:01,840
Who're you with?

493
03:20:04,160 --> 03:20:05,120
Alone.

494
03:20:06,600 --> 03:20:07,800
It's my birthday tomorrow.

495
03:20:08,480 --> 03:20:09,600
My friends...

496
03:20:09,840 --> 03:20:10,960
They kidnapped me...

497
03:20:11,000 --> 03:20:12,640
...and then they
abandoned me.

498
03:20:12,880 --> 03:20:13,760
Wait. What?

499
03:20:14,080 --> 03:20:16,600
'We're kidnapping you
and taking you to Goa!'

500
03:20:16,880 --> 03:20:21,760
Then life came and went
and kept going...

501
03:20:21,960 --> 03:20:24,560
And some politician
is trying to scare me now.

502
03:20:24,920 --> 03:20:26,680
Calling me Babygirl!

503
03:20:27,160 --> 03:20:27,640
Damini...

504
03:20:28,360 --> 03:20:29,440
Damini, pay attention.

505
03:20:35,400 --> 03:20:36,480
No!

506
03:20:36,800 --> 03:20:37,800
I have a girlfriend.

507
03:20:38,080 --> 03:20:39,440
So? I don't care.

508
03:20:39,560 --> 03:20:41,240
Ya but...I do.

509
03:20:47,240 --> 03:20:48,120
Mohit!

510
03:20:49,400 --> 03:20:50,240
Mohit!

511
03:20:50,440 --> 03:20:51,800
Mangs, little busy!

512
03:20:51,960 --> 03:20:53,000
Give me your phone!

513
03:21:06,520 --> 03:21:09,720
The number you're trying
to reach is busy.

514
03:21:09,760 --> 03:21:12,400
Please try again later.

515
03:21:12,840 --> 03:21:13,520
The number...

516
03:21:19,160 --> 03:21:22,560
The number you're trying
to reach is busy.

517
03:21:22,600 --> 03:21:24,360
Please try again later.

518
03:21:25,080 --> 03:21:27,360
Eight ero...

519
03:21:27,400 --> 03:21:32,360
...erogenous zones.

520
03:21:34,280 --> 03:21:36,400
Go away Dr Warsi!

521
03:21:37,560 --> 03:21:38,600
Hello Jeh...

522
03:21:40,880 --> 03:21:42,080
Why're you being so...

523
03:21:42,120 --> 03:21:45,360
...hot and so nice...

524
03:21:45,480 --> 03:21:47,080
...like pizza.

525
03:21:48,000 --> 03:21:49,040
Fuck.

526
03:21:52,800 --> 03:21:55,280
These pills are fucking
with my head.

527
03:21:55,760 --> 03:21:56,480
Nope.

528
03:21:57,160 --> 03:21:58,160
It's actually me.

529
03:21:59,920 --> 03:22:00,440
C'mon...

530
03:22:02,520 --> 03:22:04,240
Drink up Ms Rizvi Roy.

531
03:22:14,760 --> 03:22:16,480
How did you get here
so fast from Mumbai?

532
03:22:17,480 --> 03:22:18,840
I've been in Goa since
the morning.

533
03:22:19,920 --> 03:22:22,000
Parent's big fortieth wedding
anniversary tomorrow.

534
03:22:26,880 --> 03:22:28,920
I'm fucked Jeh,
my life is...

535
03:22:29,000 --> 03:22:29,720
Enough.

536
03:22:29,880 --> 03:22:30,960
...fucked.
-Enough.

537
03:22:31,000 --> 03:22:33,160
Just a few more hours
and the pill will wear off.

538
03:22:33,240 --> 03:22:34,600
And all will be okay.

539
03:22:35,320 --> 03:22:36,720
Promise?
-I promise.

540
03:22:44,840 --> 03:22:46,520
That's Walia's house right?

541
03:22:47,480 --> 03:22:49,800
I've always wondered
how it looks on the inside.

542
03:22:50,080 --> 03:22:50,760
Me too.

543
03:22:50,920 --> 03:22:52,800
I've heard he throws
legendary parties...

544
03:22:52,880 --> 03:22:54,200
...like with top models.

545
03:22:55,160 --> 03:22:56,840
Arjun, I meant the villa.

546
03:22:56,880 --> 03:22:58,280
Not the girls.

547
03:22:58,760 --> 03:23:00,240
Ya. Me too.

548
03:23:01,120 --> 03:23:02,240
I'm not interested in girls.

549
03:23:03,520 --> 03:23:04,320
Only women.

550
03:23:06,880 --> 03:23:07,760
Wait a second.

551
03:23:09,600 --> 03:23:10,600
You're hitting on me.

552
03:23:10,920 --> 03:23:12,280
Ya, finally.

553
03:23:12,360 --> 03:23:13,120
After four long hours!

554
03:23:13,160 --> 03:23:14,000
Seriously?

555
03:23:14,880 --> 03:23:17,320
I'm sorry,
I'm just out of practice.

556
03:23:18,800 --> 03:23:20,120
Shall we get some
practice then?

557
03:23:20,760 --> 03:23:21,480
Let's go in?

558
03:23:22,080 --> 03:23:22,680
How?

559
03:23:23,560 --> 03:23:24,160
Easy.

560
03:23:24,240 --> 03:23:25,000
Trespassing.

561
03:23:25,520 --> 03:23:26,400
Are you nuts?

562
03:23:26,560 --> 03:23:27,920
What if someone's inside?

563
03:23:28,120 --> 03:23:28,960
There's no one inside.

564
03:23:29,600 --> 03:23:31,120
Walia's hiding abroad...

565
03:23:31,160 --> 03:23:32,800
...so the government has
seized his villa.

566
03:23:33,080 --> 03:23:33,840
No guards.

567
03:23:34,600 --> 03:23:35,920
But there's a big wall.

568
03:23:38,680 --> 03:23:40,360
No.
No! No! No!

569
03:23:40,400 --> 03:23:41,240
Arjun no!

570
03:23:41,880 --> 03:23:42,760
Seriously?

571
03:23:43,440 --> 03:23:44,760
Shit! You made it!

572
03:23:46,680 --> 03:23:47,600
It's gorgeous.

573
03:23:47,880 --> 03:23:48,400
C'mon!

574
03:23:51,160 --> 03:23:52,000
Okay fine!

575
03:23:53,360 --> 03:23:54,200
Woah!

576
03:23:55,800 --> 03:23:56,360
Shit!

577
03:23:58,760 --> 03:23:59,360
Again.

578
03:23:59,520 --> 03:24:00,040
Yes!

579
03:24:00,120 --> 03:24:00,760
Again!

580
03:24:02,440 --> 03:24:03,760
Wait.
-Well, I like this new look.

581
03:24:04,440 --> 03:24:05,000
Okay.

582
03:24:05,440 --> 03:24:06,640
No, I don't need your hand.

583
03:24:08,680 --> 03:24:09,320
Let's go!

584
03:24:11,160 --> 03:24:13,400
Oh my God,
I was almost there!

585
03:24:15,920 --> 03:24:16,600
Arjun...

586
03:24:17,560 --> 03:24:18,160
Arjun!

587
03:24:19,160 --> 03:24:19,920
Arjun!

588
03:24:21,160 --> 03:24:22,800
Fuck, let's do this.
C'mon.

589
03:24:23,000 --> 03:24:24,080
One, two, three...

590
03:24:25,560 --> 03:24:27,040
Go! Fuck!

591
03:24:31,080 --> 03:24:31,680
Hey!

592
03:24:32,600 --> 03:24:34,320
The gate was open the
whole time.

593
03:24:34,840 --> 03:24:35,960
What the fuck!

594
03:25:00,360 --> 03:25:01,760
I couldn't find any
of the girls.

595
03:25:08,680 --> 03:25:09,320
Damini.

596
03:25:10,680 --> 03:25:11,160
Da...

597
03:25:27,120 --> 03:25:28,680
If we can have iced tea,

598
03:25:28,960 --> 03:25:30,440
why not hot champagne?

599
03:25:34,480 --> 03:25:35,160
Shit.

600
03:25:36,480 --> 03:25:37,600
Oh my god!

601
03:25:37,640 --> 03:25:38,720
What did you just do!

602
03:25:39,960 --> 03:25:40,600
Well,

603
03:25:41,040 --> 03:25:42,200
only one solution.

604
03:25:42,640 --> 03:25:43,360
Really?

605
03:25:53,720 --> 03:25:55,000
The water's fucking amazing.

606
03:25:55,040 --> 03:25:55,720
C'mon in.

607
03:25:57,360 --> 03:25:58,120
C'mon...

608
03:26:05,200 --> 03:26:06,080
You know what.

609
03:26:06,480 --> 03:26:06,920
Fuck it.

610
03:26:07,280 --> 03:26:08,240
There it is.

611
03:26:22,280 --> 03:26:24,160
It's fucking cold!

612
03:26:24,640 --> 03:26:25,480
Ya but it worked.

613
03:26:25,560 --> 03:26:27,040
Fuck. You tricked me!
-Ya.

614
03:26:34,000 --> 03:26:34,680
Fuck.

615
03:26:34,760 --> 03:26:35,640
You okay?

616
03:26:36,320 --> 03:26:37,360
Ya.
-You sure?

617
03:26:37,720 --> 03:26:38,320
Ya.

618
03:26:39,160 --> 03:26:39,760
Ya.

619
03:27:12,120 --> 03:27:13,040
You're a goddess.

620
03:27:38,680 --> 03:27:39,240
Oh my God.

621
03:27:39,280 --> 03:27:40,000
You truly are a goddess!

622
03:27:40,040 --> 03:27:41,400
Ya, you said that.
-I did?

623
03:28:01,800 --> 03:28:03,320
That was amazing.

624
03:28:05,760 --> 03:28:06,800
Thanks?

625
03:28:15,480 --> 03:28:16,840
I'm losing...

626
03:28:19,400 --> 03:28:20,120
It's okay.

627
03:28:22,400 --> 03:28:23,600
It's okay.
Just go to bed.

628
03:28:24,840 --> 03:28:27,000
I'm losing the battle.

629
03:28:29,080 --> 03:28:30,320
You're too strong.

630
03:28:31,680 --> 03:28:32,680
I'm not.

631
03:28:33,560 --> 03:28:34,680
Yes, you are.

632
03:28:35,720 --> 03:28:37,560
You can do anything
you want.

633
03:28:39,520 --> 03:28:41,160
And you're one of the
smartest people I know.

634
03:28:41,600 --> 03:28:43,040
Everything will be okay.

635
03:28:43,840 --> 03:28:44,400
Okay?

636
03:28:46,760 --> 03:28:47,600
Jeh...

637
03:28:47,920 --> 03:28:48,600
Yes?

638
03:28:51,240 --> 03:28:52,920
I like you Jeh Wadia...

639
03:28:54,080 --> 03:28:56,040
I like you too Damini Rizvi
Roy...

640
03:28:57,640 --> 03:28:58,920
No, I mean...

641
03:29:00,400 --> 03:29:01,200
What?

642
03:29:22,040 --> 03:29:24,000
Can we have some more
champagne please?

643
03:29:24,880 --> 03:29:25,920
Hot champagne.

644
03:29:26,560 --> 03:29:27,280
Right now?

645
03:29:27,480 --> 03:29:28,120
Ya.

646
03:29:31,280 --> 03:29:31,960
Right now?

647
03:29:32,000 --> 03:29:32,640
Ya.

648
03:29:32,880 --> 03:29:33,600
Go!

649
03:29:34,800 --> 03:29:35,400
Fuck!

650
03:29:43,360 --> 03:29:44,600
My balls!

651
03:29:44,680 --> 03:29:45,520
Fuck!

652
03:29:47,800 --> 03:29:48,520
Oh!

653
03:29:50,040 --> 03:29:50,560
Great.

654
03:29:50,600 --> 03:29:51,480
Laugh at my pain.

655
03:29:51,520 --> 03:29:52,520
It's not funny!

656
03:29:52,840 --> 03:29:55,360
What else am I
supposed to do?

657
03:29:57,680 --> 03:29:58,440
Oh!

658
03:30:01,960 --> 03:30:02,400
Just give me...

659
03:30:02,600 --> 03:30:04,680
Just give me a second.
-I'm sorry.

660
03:30:14,120 --> 03:30:14,640
Ya?

661
03:30:14,680 --> 03:30:15,640
Samara?

662
03:30:16,800 --> 03:30:17,840
Don't forget I'm your producer.

663
03:30:17,880 --> 03:30:19,880
Your shenanigans are
going to get me in trouble.

664
03:30:21,640 --> 03:30:22,640
Promise me that.
-Let me take care of that.

665
03:30:22,760 --> 03:30:23,960
Ya sure...
-Please.

666
03:30:24,040 --> 03:30:25,160
Alright. That's fine.
-Hi...

667
03:30:25,400 --> 03:30:26,520
Hi! Hi!

668
03:30:26,560 --> 03:30:28,680
Oh! My goodness.

669
03:30:28,920 --> 03:30:30,160
Hi.
-Hi! You just arrived?

670
03:30:30,360 --> 03:30:30,840
Ya...

671
03:30:30,920 --> 03:30:32,160
Ya! Umang...

672
03:30:32,600 --> 03:30:35,480
Guys, meet my absolutely
fantastic trainer...

673
03:30:35,560 --> 03:30:36,760
...Umang Singh.
-Hi.

674
03:30:36,840 --> 03:30:38,680
Who got me all fit
and ready for our film.

675
03:30:39,000 --> 03:30:39,920
Oh! She's the one.

676
03:30:40,040 --> 03:30:41,960
Yes.
-That's a great body
transformation.

677
03:30:42,040 --> 03:30:43,000
I mean Samara looks like...

678
03:30:43,040 --> 03:30:44,640
...as if she's been an
MMA fighter for a decade.

679
03:30:44,680 --> 03:30:46,120
Absolutely.
-Not bad.

680
03:30:46,800 --> 03:30:47,640
Good job Umang!

681
03:30:47,960 --> 03:30:49,520
Training tomorrow at 7am...

682
03:30:49,600 --> 03:30:52,160
...because we have to get
ready for the Thai schedule
and...

683
03:30:52,280 --> 03:30:53,760
...food is over there,
so help yourself.

684
03:30:55,320 --> 03:30:55,800
Here.

685
03:30:55,920 --> 03:30:57,040
You're trying to get me
fat now?

686
03:30:57,120 --> 03:30:57,640
C'mon...

687
03:30:58,000 --> 03:30:58,840
I'll also have some.

688
03:31:00,880 --> 03:31:01,600
Nice try.

689
03:31:02,200 --> 03:31:02,800
C'mon!

690
03:31:04,120 --> 03:31:05,120
One more. One more.

691
03:31:07,760 --> 03:31:08,640
What?

692
03:31:09,840 --> 03:31:11,120
Damini, I like you too.

693
03:31:12,320 --> 03:31:13,960
Infact I like you too much.

694
03:31:14,520 --> 03:31:16,000
But not now, not like this.

695
03:31:17,400 --> 03:31:18,560
You get some rest.

696
03:31:19,040 --> 03:31:20,120
I'll be right here.

697
03:31:20,840 --> 03:31:21,520
Tomorrow.

698
03:31:22,160 --> 03:31:23,000
Day after.

699
03:31:23,360 --> 03:31:25,160
The day after that
and the day after that.

700
03:31:25,800 --> 03:31:26,440
Okay?

701
03:31:27,160 --> 03:31:28,040
Promise?

702
03:31:29,320 --> 03:31:30,120
I promise.

703
03:31:39,840 --> 03:31:41,600
Happy birthday Ms Rizvi Roy.

704
03:31:52,120 --> 03:31:53,040
Shalom.

705
03:32:25,880 --> 03:32:26,480
So...

706
03:32:27,080 --> 03:32:28,080
...nothing...

707
03:32:28,640 --> 03:32:29,320
...happened?

708
03:32:30,880 --> 03:32:31,960
Siddi-Piddi...

709
03:32:32,400 --> 03:32:34,400
I still can't believe
you were a virgin.

710
03:32:37,520 --> 03:32:38,400
Were?

711
03:32:39,840 --> 03:32:40,960
Fuck.

712
03:32:48,480 --> 03:32:49,440
Were.
