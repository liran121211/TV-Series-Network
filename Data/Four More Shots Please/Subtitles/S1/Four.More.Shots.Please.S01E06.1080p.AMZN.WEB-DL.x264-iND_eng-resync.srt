1
02:24:15,400 --> 02:24:16,160
I know, I know.

2
02:24:16,240 --> 02:24:19,600
It's destiny that decides
when and where friendships strike.

3
02:24:20,200 --> 02:24:24,480
But I think I played a small role
in their crazy friendship.

4
02:24:27,600 --> 02:24:30,880
Your response will be,
Lord graciously hear us.

5
02:24:31,560 --> 02:24:33,320
Let us pray with confidence...

6
02:24:33,400 --> 02:24:35,520
...to our saviour Jesus Christ...

7
02:24:35,600 --> 02:24:37,680
...who shared our earthly exile...

8
02:24:37,760 --> 02:24:40,520
...in order to bring us to
our heavenly home.

9
02:24:40,600 --> 02:24:41,720
Your response...

10
02:24:42,640 --> 02:24:45,040
... to the fullness of that life...
-Julie Didi!

11
02:24:45,120 --> 02:24:48,120
...Christ won for us
will be earned back...

12
02:24:51,280 --> 02:24:54,440
Give a huge round of
applause for Damini Rizvi Roy!

13
02:24:54,480 --> 02:24:55,480
Thank you! Thank you!

14
02:24:55,520 --> 02:24:56,960
What a story!

15
02:24:57,040 --> 02:24:59,320
Undressing the
homophobic minister.

16
02:25:00,280 --> 02:25:03,560
I got a call from
STC Finance.

17
02:25:04,240 --> 02:25:06,640
Just some last minute
final hygiene checks.

18
02:25:07,280 --> 02:25:09,480
I'm really hoping this
will happen.

19
02:25:10,960 --> 02:25:11,520
Wow!

20
02:25:11,600 --> 02:25:12,360
Excited?

21
02:25:13,040 --> 02:25:14,720
Really overwhelmed actually.

22
02:25:14,800 --> 02:25:15,680
Thank you Uma.

23
02:25:19,520 --> 02:25:21,200
You don't have
much experience.

24
02:25:21,520 --> 02:25:23,960
Ma'am, I was a PT teacher
in a government school.

25
02:25:24,320 --> 02:25:25,120
C'mon.

26
02:25:25,200 --> 02:25:27,400
Managing village children
is a lot more different than...

27
02:25:27,480 --> 02:25:28,840
...training high profile clients.

28
02:25:29,520 --> 02:25:30,840
Darling, this is SoBo.

29
02:25:31,320 --> 02:25:33,200
You know it's two
very different worlds.

30
02:25:33,960 --> 02:25:35,400
Ma'am, you can pay
me less.

31
02:25:35,480 --> 02:25:37,160
I'll settle for fifteen grands
a month.

32
02:25:37,240 --> 02:25:37,840
Grands...

33
02:25:38,320 --> 02:25:40,760
Also ma'am,
Ludhiana is not a village.

34
02:25:41,840 --> 02:25:42,960
Here's a tip.

35
02:25:43,040 --> 02:25:44,520
Join an English-speaking course.

36
02:25:45,520 --> 02:25:46,240
And...

37
02:25:46,320 --> 02:25:47,600
...you might want to
buy some...

38
02:25:47,680 --> 02:25:48,800
...proper training gear.

39
02:25:49,280 --> 02:25:51,160
You remind me of a
background dancer from a...

40
02:25:51,240 --> 02:25:52,760
...nineties Bollywood film.

41
02:25:56,560 --> 02:25:58,000
Woah!

42
02:25:58,080 --> 02:25:58,920
Yes!

43
02:25:59,560 --> 02:26:00,080
Yes!

44
02:26:02,640 --> 02:26:03,760
Hi baby!

45
02:26:03,840 --> 02:26:04,680
Hi Anjana.

46
02:26:06,600 --> 02:26:08,200
Fuck!
-I told you!

47
02:26:09,320 --> 02:26:10,760
They'll reach the finals...

48
02:26:11,800 --> 02:26:12,480
Varun,

49
02:26:12,560 --> 02:26:14,000
she's soaking wet.

50
02:26:14,080 --> 02:26:15,360
When did you change
the diaper?

51
02:26:15,440 --> 02:26:16,480
Like just...

52
02:26:16,560 --> 02:26:18,760
...some five minutes ago
I changed the diaper.

53
02:26:19,520 --> 02:26:20,120
Baby,

54
02:26:20,560 --> 02:26:21,880
why do you pee
so much!

55
02:26:24,720 --> 02:26:26,560
Goal!

56
02:26:26,640 --> 02:26:27,360
Yes!
-Yes!

57
02:26:28,640 --> 02:26:29,560
Varun!

58
02:26:32,240 --> 02:26:33,280
Varun!

59
02:26:35,400 --> 02:26:36,840
What happened?
You okay?

60
02:26:38,560 --> 02:26:39,560
Look at this mess.

61
02:26:40,520 --> 02:26:41,840
Is this our home
or a railway station?

62
02:26:43,440 --> 02:26:44,760
It's not the end of
the world.

63
02:26:44,840 --> 02:26:46,640
Well, it sure as hell
looks like it.

64
02:26:47,280 --> 02:26:48,440
And what about dinner?

65
02:26:48,960 --> 02:26:50,360
You guys finished
everything?

66
02:26:50,440 --> 02:26:50,920
Fuck!

67
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:52,160
These morons
finished everything.

68
02:26:52,240 --> 02:26:53,000
I'm so sorry.

69
02:26:53,920 --> 02:26:55,240
There are eggs in
the refrigerator.

70
02:26:55,720 --> 02:26:56,640
Will you make yourself
an omelette?

71
02:26:58,800 --> 02:26:59,520
Sure.

72
02:27:00,440 --> 02:27:01,200
Thanks...

73
02:27:04,240 --> 02:27:04,800
Oh shit!

74
02:27:04,880 --> 02:27:05,840
What are you doing?

75
02:27:06,200 --> 02:27:07,240
Making a mess.

76
02:27:07,680 --> 02:27:09,320
Ok, I think you've lost it
right now?

77
02:27:09,400 --> 02:27:10,120
Hmmm.

78
02:27:11,280 --> 02:27:12,000
Baby,

79
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:14,240
we'll share the load.

80
02:27:15,240 --> 02:27:17,720
Share the load my
fucking ass!

81
02:27:18,560 --> 02:27:19,960
Match with the boys!

82
02:27:20,040 --> 02:27:21,120
Beer with the boys!

83
02:27:21,200 --> 02:27:22,720
Script session with the boys!

84
02:27:22,800 --> 02:27:24,960
And I, like a fucking fool,

85
02:27:25,040 --> 02:27:27,600
bust my ass every
single day!

86
02:27:27,680 --> 02:27:28,760
Feeding Arya!

87
02:27:28,840 --> 02:27:30,040
Pumping for Arya!

88
02:27:30,120 --> 02:27:31,520
Taking care of this house!

89
02:27:31,600 --> 02:27:32,600
Going to work!
-Okay.

90
02:27:32,680 --> 02:27:34,440
Doing every god damn thing!

91
02:27:34,520 --> 02:27:35,400
Chill, chill, chill.

92
02:27:35,480 --> 02:27:37,160
The boys are outside, okay?

93
02:27:37,240 --> 02:27:39,800
Now this is seeming like
some scene from a sitcom.

94
02:27:39,880 --> 02:27:40,320
It's...

95
02:27:40,640 --> 02:27:42,680
I mean...I'm going
to put it in my new work.

96
02:27:43,240 --> 02:27:44,680
But...game's on.

97
02:27:44,760 --> 02:27:46,200
I will deal with it later, okay?

98
02:27:57,880 --> 02:27:58,920
Jeh, listen to me.

99
02:28:01,080 --> 02:28:02,400
Myra, I saw you with him.

100
02:28:02,480 --> 02:28:03,200
That wasn't a kiss.

101
02:28:03,280 --> 02:28:04,640
It was fucking tonsil hockey!

102
02:28:04,720 --> 02:28:05,800
It meant nothing!

103
02:28:05,880 --> 02:28:06,360
Okay?

104
02:28:06,440 --> 02:28:08,360
I panicked after you
proposed.

105
02:28:08,840 --> 02:28:11,120
It felt like a door
closing on my face.

106
02:28:12,320 --> 02:28:13,320
So I'm a door now?

107
02:28:14,160 --> 02:28:15,680
Jeh, that's not what
I meant.

108
02:28:15,760 --> 02:28:16,960
I just mean you're so...

109
02:28:17,040 --> 02:28:18,600
...perfect all the time!

110
02:28:18,920 --> 02:28:20,800
It's really suffocating, okay?

111
02:28:21,160 --> 02:28:22,600
Oh my God, who are you?

112
02:28:22,680 --> 02:28:23,360
Who are you?

113
02:28:23,440 --> 02:28:25,000
Was I drunk this
entire relationship?

114
02:28:26,840 --> 02:28:27,640
You know what Myra?

115
02:28:28,640 --> 02:28:29,160
Go.

116
02:28:29,800 --> 02:28:32,840
Go break down all the windows,
doors and walls.

117
02:28:33,200 --> 02:28:34,040
C'mon Jeh...

118
02:28:34,120 --> 02:28:34,560
Myra...

119
02:28:34,640 --> 02:28:35,480
C'mon, are you serious?
-Myra...

120
02:28:35,560 --> 02:28:37,640
It was just a kiss!
-Myra, get the fuck out of my life!

121
02:28:38,200 --> 02:28:39,320
Mistakes happen Jeh...

122
02:28:39,440 --> 02:28:40,640
It could've been you too.

123
02:28:41,160 --> 02:28:42,040
Fuck you.

124
02:28:42,560 --> 02:28:44,280
And get the fuck out
of my life.

125
02:28:48,440 --> 02:28:49,920
Well, fuck you too!

126
02:28:51,720 --> 02:28:52,880
You fucking loser!

127
02:29:44,840 --> 02:29:47,160
These troll centres
in Russia and China...

128
02:29:47,240 --> 02:29:50,040
...their social media marketing
company is just a façade.

129
02:29:50,120 --> 02:29:51,840
Actually, they are just
working for the highest bidder...

130
02:29:51,920 --> 02:29:53,480
...to eliminate
competition and dissent.

131
02:29:53,560 --> 02:29:54,040
Ya.

132
02:29:54,400 --> 02:29:58,040
But how do we prove that
political parties are funding them?

133
02:29:59,800 --> 02:30:01,920
Remember that EVM hacking
story we did a few months back?

134
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:02,560
Yes...

135
02:30:02,640 --> 02:30:03,720
Still in touch with the hacker?

136
02:30:04,120 --> 02:30:04,720
I could be.

137
02:30:05,680 --> 02:30:06,360
Good.

138
02:30:06,440 --> 02:30:07,480
What about Akanksha?

139
02:30:08,840 --> 02:30:10,920
We'll cross the bridge
when we get to it.

140
02:30:15,520 --> 02:30:16,120
Ya Uma?

141
02:30:17,520 --> 02:30:18,440
Seriously?

142
02:30:18,520 --> 02:30:19,280
Akanksha?

143
02:30:19,360 --> 02:30:20,720
Editor-in-Chief?

144
02:30:20,800 --> 02:30:21,920
You can't replace me.

145
02:30:22,680 --> 02:30:24,240
It was a majority decision.

146
02:30:24,320 --> 02:30:25,920
And that trolls story?

147
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:27,680
That you were going to do
behind our back?

148
02:30:28,320 --> 02:30:30,200
You should've thought
twice before doing that.

149
02:30:30,280 --> 02:30:31,960
Akanksha was an intern
in New York...

150
02:30:32,040 --> 02:30:32,840
...for crying out loud!

151
02:30:32,920 --> 02:30:34,200
She has no experience!

152
02:30:34,560 --> 02:30:37,000
She can't tell me what
stories I can or cannot do!

153
02:30:38,160 --> 02:30:39,640
This month's profits are
already higher...

154
02:30:39,720 --> 02:30:41,080
...than last quarter.

155
02:30:41,160 --> 02:30:42,680
All thanks to her.

156
02:30:42,760 --> 02:30:45,960
So yes, she can tell you
what to do and what not to.

157
02:30:46,040 --> 02:30:48,080
This is my news site,
built by me,

158
02:30:48,160 --> 02:30:49,440
on my reputation, Uma.

159
02:30:49,520 --> 02:30:51,640
This is not your news site.

160
02:30:55,960 --> 02:30:57,600
Alone, over here, like this...

161
02:30:58,160 --> 02:30:59,720
So I don't make
a scene in the office?

162
02:31:01,800 --> 02:31:02,440
And if I don't agree?

163
02:31:02,520 --> 02:31:03,560
You'll push me down
the stairs?

164
02:31:04,120 --> 02:31:05,160
Please!

165
02:31:05,240 --> 02:31:07,920
Stop being so overly
dramatic, Damini.

166
02:31:12,040 --> 02:31:13,600
Did you see what Nisha sent?
-I did.

167
02:31:13,680 --> 02:31:16,080
Did you see the picture
of Sandeep shit faced?

168
02:31:17,200 --> 02:31:18,040
I have them open
right here.

169
02:31:18,120 --> 02:31:19,600
You can't do that.

170
02:31:19,680 --> 02:31:21,520
Sandeep, how many drinks
did you have?

171
02:31:21,600 --> 02:31:22,320
Just one.

172
02:31:36,040 --> 02:31:37,040
Oh shit!

173
02:31:38,440 --> 02:31:38,920
Ouch.

174
02:31:39,480 --> 02:31:40,280
Oh my God.

175
02:31:42,720 --> 02:31:43,520
Ms. Menon?

176
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:47,280
Stud.

177
02:31:47,880 --> 02:31:50,520
Not you, my earring
just fell, so...

178
02:31:50,600 --> 02:31:51,240
Ya...

179
02:31:53,280 --> 02:31:53,960
Ouch.

180
02:31:54,040 --> 02:31:55,040
Are you okay?

181
02:31:55,440 --> 02:31:56,560
Let me help you up.

182
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:58,000
I'm okay, I'm okay.

183
02:31:58,080 --> 02:31:58,600
Are you alright?

184
02:31:58,680 --> 02:32:00,320
Yes, I'm fine.
-Let me just...

185
02:32:00,400 --> 02:32:00,880
Are you okay?

186
02:32:00,960 --> 02:32:01,960
Yes, I'm fine, I'm fine.

187
02:32:02,040 --> 02:32:03,520
I'm fine, thanks.
Thanks.

188
02:32:03,600 --> 02:32:04,600
Please get back to work.

189
02:32:06,080 --> 02:32:06,600
Cool.

190
02:32:10,200 --> 02:32:11,400
Fuck!

191
02:32:13,640 --> 02:32:14,960
Shut up Ms.VeeVee!

192
02:32:22,200 --> 02:32:23,560
Come here baby...

193
02:32:25,600 --> 02:32:27,440
Don't be shy...

194
02:32:29,240 --> 02:32:32,320
Take off your clothes...

195
02:32:33,280 --> 02:32:35,440
Get on top of me...

196
02:32:36,200 --> 02:32:37,480
And kiss me...

197
02:32:37,560 --> 02:32:39,280
Move your hand!

198
02:32:39,360 --> 02:32:41,000
-Move your hand!
-Undress me...

199
02:32:41,080 --> 02:32:43,440
Move your hand!

200
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:45,560
Move your hand!

201
02:32:45,640 --> 02:32:48,520
-Move your hand!
-Take off my blouse...

202
02:32:49,640 --> 02:32:50,880
Do me harder...

203
02:32:50,920 --> 02:32:51,920
Harder...

204
02:32:52,040 --> 02:32:53,760
C'mon baby, harder...

205
02:32:54,120 --> 02:32:56,560
Porn in a theatre and
public make out session.

206
02:32:56,640 --> 02:32:57,760
Check and check.

207
02:32:57,840 --> 02:32:59,240
What's next on your
wish list?

208
02:32:59,760 --> 02:33:01,520
I fucking love you!

209
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,040
What exactly did your
friend say?

210
02:33:46,160 --> 02:33:47,880
I FUCKING love you or...

211
02:33:47,920 --> 02:33:49,560
...I fucking LOVE you?

212
02:33:51,280 --> 02:33:52,360
You tell me...

213
02:33:52,440 --> 02:33:54,280
Both sound the
same to me.

214
02:33:55,280 --> 02:33:55,840
Oh.

215
02:33:56,520 --> 02:33:58,040
Ok, but why're you asking?

216
02:33:58,120 --> 02:33:58,720
I told you, remember?

217
02:33:58,800 --> 02:34:00,920
My friend's friend said
this to her.

218
02:34:01,920 --> 02:34:02,600
Okay.

219
02:34:03,360 --> 02:34:05,120
Ask your friend,

220
02:34:05,440 --> 02:34:06,280
did she say...

221
02:34:06,360 --> 02:34:08,800
...I love fucking you by
any chance?

222
02:34:11,120 --> 02:34:11,920
Very good.

223
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:12,600
Thank you.

224
02:34:12,680 --> 02:34:14,240
Hey Dee!
-So much help.

225
02:34:14,280 --> 02:34:15,360
Hey Dee, what's up?

226
02:34:16,160 --> 02:34:16,840
Dee?

227
02:34:17,920 --> 02:34:19,040
That fucking board.

228
02:34:20,520 --> 02:34:23,040
They're trying to replace
me with that fucking Akanksha.

229
02:34:24,880 --> 02:34:25,920
They can't, can they?

230
02:34:27,160 --> 02:34:28,040
Anj?

231
02:34:29,480 --> 02:34:31,280
If they have majority votes,

232
02:34:31,640 --> 02:34:32,480
then yes.

233
02:34:32,560 --> 02:34:33,920
I'm the founder!

234
02:34:34,720 --> 02:34:36,120
Do I or don't I have
any rights?

235
02:34:36,480 --> 02:34:39,360
Dee, the contract always
sides with the majority...

236
02:34:39,440 --> 02:34:40,880
...incase of a deadlock...

237
02:34:40,920 --> 02:34:41,920
...or differences that...

238
02:34:42,040 --> 02:34:44,560
...cannot be solved amicably.
-Don't business ethics count?

239
02:34:45,280 --> 02:34:47,920
Ethics is a very
subjective idea, Dee.

240
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:49,360
Everyone feels they are right,

241
02:34:49,440 --> 02:34:50,040
that they are ethical.

242
02:34:50,160 --> 02:34:52,640
Legally, though,
the board is right.

243
02:34:52,720 --> 02:34:54,360
Are you my lawyer
or theirs?

244
02:34:55,760 --> 02:34:58,120
Dee, I am your lawyer
and your friend.

245
02:34:58,160 --> 02:34:59,480
I would hack them to
pieces for you.

246
02:34:59,560 --> 02:35:01,120
I have enough rage
for that.

247
02:35:01,160 --> 02:35:02,600
But facts are facts.

248
02:35:02,680 --> 02:35:04,160
You said the agreement
was fair.

249
02:35:04,240 --> 02:35:05,880
Yes! It's fair but...

250
02:35:06,520 --> 02:35:08,280
...but not one-sided right?

251
02:35:09,680 --> 02:35:10,160
Fuck.

252
02:35:12,800 --> 02:35:13,360
Dee...

253
02:35:18,760 --> 02:35:19,880
Let's have a drink?

254
02:35:19,960 --> 02:35:20,880
You'll feel better...

255
02:35:22,800 --> 02:35:23,640
Hi guys!

256
02:35:26,320 --> 02:35:28,640
Why are all these sad
emojis hanging together?

257
02:35:29,480 --> 02:35:30,720
You seem very happy.

258
02:35:30,800 --> 02:35:31,960
Have you smoked a joint?

259
02:35:32,040 --> 02:35:34,120
Life is a high,
my dear Umang.

260
02:35:38,960 --> 02:35:39,960
Listen,

261
02:35:40,040 --> 02:35:41,600
a friend of Sneha's...

262
02:35:41,680 --> 02:35:42,840
...also has OCD.

263
02:35:42,920 --> 02:35:44,560
And she keeps a diary
of the colour,

264
02:35:44,640 --> 02:35:46,560
shape and consistency
of her poop.

265
02:35:47,400 --> 02:35:48,440
Do you also do that?

266
02:35:49,200 --> 02:35:49,800
Tell us.

267
02:35:50,200 --> 02:35:50,600
Tell us.

268
02:35:50,680 --> 02:35:52,160
Do you do that too?
-I'm sure she does.

269
02:35:52,240 --> 02:35:53,440
Do you do that too?
-You have a diary in your bag.

270
02:35:53,520 --> 02:35:54,400
Should I check?
Should I check?

271
02:35:54,480 --> 02:35:55,360
Should I pull it out?

272
02:35:57,920 --> 02:36:00,320
Do you guys remember when
we met for the first time?

273
02:36:00,400 --> 02:36:01,640
Oh God!

274
02:36:02,280 --> 02:36:04,480
The three of us were
so low!

275
02:36:04,560 --> 02:36:05,400
Oh man!

276
02:36:05,480 --> 02:36:07,240
I was the only one on a
fucking high.

277
02:36:14,560 --> 02:36:15,920
What are you staring at,
asshole!

278
02:36:21,560 --> 02:36:22,360
Fuck Bar.

279
02:36:22,440 --> 02:36:24,040
Wow! What a name!

280
02:36:24,120 --> 02:36:25,720
Just like this fucking city!

281
02:36:45,480 --> 02:36:46,280
Ingenious.

282
02:37:03,280 --> 02:37:04,920
Hi, can I get a martini please?

283
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:06,080
We don't do cocktails.

284
02:37:06,760 --> 02:37:07,960
Because you don't give
a 'Fuck'?

285
02:37:08,480 --> 02:37:09,000
Excuse me?

286
02:37:10,680 --> 02:37:11,320
G&T?

287
02:37:11,400 --> 02:37:11,920
Sure.

288
02:37:12,520 --> 02:37:12,840
Thanks.

289
02:37:12,920 --> 02:37:14,240
Also, please take
that off the counter.

290
02:37:16,280 --> 02:37:17,040
Where do I keep it then?

291
02:37:17,120 --> 02:37:18,000
Floor. Lap.

292
02:37:18,600 --> 02:37:19,400
What?

293
02:37:19,480 --> 02:37:20,960
It's an award. Just keep it
behind the counter.

294
02:37:21,040 --> 02:37:21,840
This is a bar.

295
02:37:22,240 --> 02:37:23,040
Not a shopping mall.

296
02:37:23,120 --> 02:37:24,440
And you aren't a
security guard either.

297
02:37:24,520 --> 02:37:26,080
Just a bartender.
Keep it.

298
02:37:30,760 --> 02:37:32,880
It should be called 'Fuck
This Bar' instead of 'Fuck Bar'.

299
02:37:34,040 --> 02:37:35,720
He's just frustrated.
Must've wanted to be an actor.

300
02:37:36,200 --> 02:37:37,200
Or a musician.

301
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:39,720
What's the award for?

302
02:37:40,760 --> 02:37:42,000
Fearless journalism.

303
02:37:42,560 --> 02:37:43,240
Oh.

304
02:37:43,680 --> 02:37:45,360
You're on TV?
Which channel?

305
02:37:45,440 --> 02:37:47,160
No, I write blogs.

306
02:37:47,240 --> 02:37:48,160
I don't come on TV.

307
02:37:48,600 --> 02:37:49,600
You should.

308
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:51,120
You have a good face cut.

309
02:37:52,840 --> 02:37:53,640
Thanks.

310
02:37:55,840 --> 02:37:57,160
Waiting for your date?

311
02:37:58,760 --> 02:37:59,320
No.

312
02:38:00,880 --> 02:38:01,720
Are you single?

313
02:38:03,280 --> 02:38:04,120
Yes.

314
02:38:09,400 --> 02:38:11,320
Umang. From Ludhiana.

315
02:38:11,760 --> 02:38:13,520
Damini, from Delhi originally.

316
02:38:13,600 --> 02:38:14,480
Nice to meet you.

317
02:38:16,360 --> 02:38:18,320
I had heard about such bars.

318
02:38:19,640 --> 02:38:21,840
What kind of bars?
-You know, P joints?

319
02:38:23,680 --> 02:38:24,160
Huh?

320
02:38:24,720 --> 02:38:27,080
You know, the name of the bar
has 'Fuck' in it.

321
02:38:27,160 --> 02:38:28,960
This is such a To-The-Point city.

322
02:38:29,040 --> 02:38:29,960
Like meet people,

323
02:38:30,040 --> 02:38:31,560
have a few drinks
and then...you know.

324
02:38:33,840 --> 02:38:34,640
Oh!

325
02:38:34,720 --> 02:38:36,080
P joint as in....

326
02:38:36,160 --> 02:38:37,120
...pick-up joint?

327
02:38:37,960 --> 02:38:38,960
Oh God, no!

328
02:38:39,040 --> 02:38:39,840
No!

329
02:38:40,440 --> 02:38:43,800
Mumbai isn't that
liberal and open yet.

330
02:38:43,880 --> 02:38:45,000
Also, a word of advice...

331
02:38:45,080 --> 02:38:46,840
...if a guy is trying to
pick you up in a place like...

332
02:38:46,920 --> 02:38:48,680
Who's talking about guys?

333
02:38:51,400 --> 02:38:52,120
Oh.

334
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:53,680
Oh.

335
02:38:54,240 --> 02:38:54,960
Right.

336
02:38:56,760 --> 02:38:57,600
I'm not...

337
02:38:58,320 --> 02:38:59,240
Not that you're not...

338
02:38:59,560 --> 02:39:02,000
I would if I were...but I'm not.

339
02:39:03,200 --> 02:39:04,120
Not that I'm prejudiced.

340
02:39:04,200 --> 02:39:05,800
I take part in the
pride parade every year.

341
02:39:05,880 --> 02:39:07,440
But I'm...

342
02:39:07,800 --> 02:39:08,560
...straight.

343
02:39:10,360 --> 02:39:12,040
When I complimented you
on your face cut,

344
02:39:12,120 --> 02:39:13,280
why did you blush?

345
02:39:19,560 --> 02:39:20,240
Sorry...

346
02:39:23,760 --> 02:39:24,600
That's five hundred.

347
02:39:25,200 --> 02:39:25,960
Start a tab?

348
02:39:26,280 --> 02:39:27,320
No. Pay as you drink.

349
02:39:29,280 --> 02:39:31,520
Ok then...here you go.

350
02:39:35,320 --> 02:39:36,520
Let's go, let's go...

351
02:39:36,600 --> 02:39:38,080
Sorry, sorry, sorry!

352
02:39:38,160 --> 02:39:39,160
Oh fuck!

353
02:39:43,240 --> 02:39:44,040
Serendipity?

354
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:46,640
Let's go!

355
02:39:48,600 --> 02:39:49,760
Let's park this there.

356
02:39:51,680 --> 02:39:53,840
Come, come, come.

357
02:39:54,240 --> 02:39:57,120
Two seconds, two seconds.

358
02:39:57,200 --> 02:40:02,040
Calm down, calm down.

359
02:40:04,640 --> 02:40:06,120
What the fuck!

360
02:40:06,200 --> 02:40:06,680
Dude!

361
02:40:07,240 --> 02:40:08,480
What the hell is going on
here man?

362
02:40:12,280 --> 02:40:13,680
Ma'am, are you...

363
02:40:13,760 --> 02:40:14,760
...are you feeding the
baby here?

364
02:40:15,240 --> 02:40:16,440
Yes, I am.

365
02:40:17,080 --> 02:40:17,560
But don't worry,

366
02:40:17,640 --> 02:40:19,200
I'm not ordering any
alcohol okay?

367
02:40:19,280 --> 02:40:21,040
Actually, I haven't had
any alcohol...

368
02:40:21,120 --> 02:40:22,440
...since I heard of my
pregnancy.

369
02:40:22,520 --> 02:40:23,080
Except for that...

370
02:40:23,160 --> 02:40:25,840
...one glass of champagne
I had at my promotion party.

371
02:40:25,920 --> 02:40:27,080
And that one...

372
02:40:27,160 --> 02:40:28,520
...beer at my baby shower.

373
02:40:29,720 --> 02:40:31,080
Can I have a beer please?

374
02:40:31,160 --> 02:40:32,280
Not for her, for me?

375
02:40:33,160 --> 02:40:33,920
Give me a minute please...

376
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,640
Why don't you go to the
ladies room and do your stuff!

377
02:40:36,720 --> 02:40:37,800
Do my stuff?

378
02:40:38,480 --> 02:40:39,160
How would you feel...

379
02:40:39,240 --> 02:40:40,800
...if you had to go to the
toilet and drink?

380
02:40:40,880 --> 02:40:42,160
I take a dump every morning...

381
02:40:42,240 --> 02:40:43,080
...with my tea!
-Alright...

382
02:40:43,160 --> 02:40:43,760
Disgusting!

383
02:40:43,840 --> 02:40:44,920
Ma'am...I'm really...

384
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:46,360
I'm really sorry but...
-No c'mon, please...

385
02:40:46,440 --> 02:40:48,480
Where am I...where
am I supposed to go?

386
02:40:49,960 --> 02:40:51,720
Excuse me...washroom?

387
02:40:53,520 --> 02:40:54,280
Washroom?

388
02:40:54,800 --> 02:40:55,360
Over there.

389
02:41:03,840 --> 02:41:04,720
Oh shit.

390
02:41:05,680 --> 02:41:06,640
Oh shit!

391
02:41:07,120 --> 02:41:08,880
Oh shit! I'm...I'm so sorry.
Oh shit!

392
02:41:09,320 --> 02:41:11,280
One second baby!
One second! One second!

393
02:41:11,360 --> 02:41:13,560
Hey! Hey! No self-service!
-Shit! Shit! Shit!

394
02:41:14,520 --> 02:41:16,480
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Didn't I tell you no self-service?

395
02:41:16,560 --> 02:41:17,120
What do you think
you're doing?

396
02:41:17,200 --> 02:41:18,240
We can't keep our stuff on
the counter.

397
02:41:18,320 --> 02:41:18,960
We can't take beer.

398
02:41:19,040 --> 02:41:19,880
If you're not going to
serve me,

399
02:41:19,960 --> 02:41:21,200
I have to serve myself!

400
02:41:21,320 --> 02:41:21,960
What do you think
you're doing?!

401
02:41:22,080 --> 02:41:23,400
What the hell!
-Are you crazy?!

402
02:41:23,480 --> 02:41:25,600
Let me drink! Let it go!
-What the hell!

403
02:41:25,680 --> 02:41:27,960
Let it go! It's my beer!
-What the fuck!

404
02:41:28,080 --> 02:41:29,200
Are you guys insane?!

405
02:41:29,480 --> 02:41:30,040
Idiots!

406
02:41:31,200 --> 02:41:32,720
Oh my God!

407
02:41:33,800 --> 02:41:34,960
Oh my God!

408
02:41:35,480 --> 02:41:36,440
Fucking idiots!

409
02:42:01,680 --> 02:42:02,960
I only have a hundred
and twenty.

410
02:42:06,920 --> 02:42:07,600
And the rest?

411
02:42:09,280 --> 02:42:11,200
Four hundered for two beers?
I mean...

412
02:42:11,280 --> 02:42:12,960
Is this a bar or a
jewellery shop?

413
02:42:13,280 --> 02:42:14,360
I mean...I promise...

414
02:42:14,440 --> 02:42:16,480
I had three thousand in my
pocket this morning.

415
02:42:16,560 --> 02:42:18,200
Taxi fare, six hundred.

416
02:42:18,280 --> 02:42:19,480
Phone recharge, five hundred.

417
02:42:19,560 --> 02:42:21,920
One bottle of water, fifty.

418
02:42:23,320 --> 02:42:24,720
You know what the
taxi driver said to me?

419
02:42:24,800 --> 02:42:25,280
He said...

420
02:42:25,360 --> 02:42:26,320
"Madam, I'm also from
a small town."

421
02:42:26,400 --> 02:42:27,360
I said, "Wow, that's great!"

422
02:42:27,440 --> 02:42:28,480
He kept on blabbering...

423
02:42:28,560 --> 02:42:31,960
...and going round and
round in circles!

424
02:42:32,720 --> 02:42:34,720
What the hell does small
town mean anyway?!

425
02:42:34,840 --> 02:42:37,080
I mean either you're
from a town or a village!

426
02:42:41,720 --> 02:42:42,640
The price of one beer...

427
02:42:43,120 --> 02:42:43,800
...is on the menu.

428
02:42:44,560 --> 02:42:45,880
Ladies night?
Discount?

429
02:42:45,960 --> 02:42:47,400
Something? Anything?

430
02:42:47,480 --> 02:42:49,680
I'll wash dishes for you!

431
02:42:50,360 --> 02:42:50,880
I mean...

432
02:42:51,640 --> 02:42:54,160
Owner won't be bankrupt
for three hundred.

433
02:42:54,200 --> 02:42:54,920
I'm the owner.

434
02:42:55,920 --> 02:42:56,400
Oh.

435
02:42:56,880 --> 02:42:57,320
You?

436
02:43:03,200 --> 02:43:04,400
Can I use the washroom?

437
02:43:04,480 --> 02:43:06,480
I have some change too.

438
02:43:28,360 --> 02:43:29,960
One second baby.
One second! One second!

439
02:43:30,720 --> 02:43:31,600
Oh my God!

440
02:43:32,200 --> 02:43:32,960
Oh my God!

441
02:43:33,040 --> 02:43:35,080
Oh my God!
Oh my God!

442
02:43:35,160 --> 02:43:36,280
Oh my God!

443
02:43:36,360 --> 02:43:37,960
Oh my God!

444
02:43:38,080 --> 02:43:39,560
Please don't panic!

445
02:43:39,640 --> 02:43:40,720
Turn of the tap!

446
02:43:41,720 --> 02:43:42,440
Stop!

447
02:43:46,880 --> 02:43:48,360
Please stop it!

448
02:43:50,160 --> 02:43:52,720
Shit hit the ceiling.
Like literally!

449
02:43:52,800 --> 02:43:53,720
It wasn't that much.

450
02:43:53,800 --> 02:43:55,160
I still haven't understood...

451
02:43:55,200 --> 02:43:56,160
...how babies produce...

452
02:43:56,200 --> 02:43:58,040
...so much poop and pee?

453
02:44:00,040 --> 02:44:01,440
Alright...

454
02:44:01,960 --> 02:44:02,800
Oh God!

455
02:44:07,480 --> 02:44:08,080
What happened?

456
02:44:08,160 --> 02:44:09,560
What happened?
-Thank God you called!

457
02:44:09,640 --> 02:44:11,400
I was getting so worried!

458
02:44:11,480 --> 02:44:13,640
My little baby...

459
02:44:13,720 --> 02:44:15,280
I've parked just around
the corner...

460
02:44:16,160 --> 02:44:17,280
There are two bags of
pumped milk...

461
02:44:17,360 --> 02:44:19,560
...in the freezer in
case she needs a night feed.

462
02:44:19,960 --> 02:44:21,360
Defrost it.

463
02:44:21,440 --> 02:44:22,200
What do you mean?

464
02:44:23,160 --> 02:44:24,160
I mean...

465
02:44:24,800 --> 02:44:26,080
...I'm taking the night off.

466
02:44:26,960 --> 02:44:27,680
Ya.

467
02:44:27,720 --> 02:44:28,640
Cool. Of course.

468
02:44:30,160 --> 02:44:31,720
Mamma's taking the
night off, okay?

469
02:44:34,800 --> 02:44:35,960
Also Varun,

470
02:44:36,960 --> 02:44:38,480
just pack your bags
tomorrow morning...

471
02:44:38,560 --> 02:44:39,640
...and leave.

472
02:44:41,040 --> 02:44:42,120
C'mon Anj...

473
02:44:42,200 --> 02:44:44,040
Why're you being so
melodramatic?

474
02:44:45,680 --> 02:44:46,680
Let's discuss this tomorrow?

475
02:44:50,440 --> 02:44:52,800
Varun, I have place for
just one baby in my life and...

476
02:44:53,320 --> 02:44:53,920
...that's her.

477
02:44:56,480 --> 02:44:58,040
Please take care
of her for the night.

478
02:45:10,200 --> 02:45:11,040
Freedom!

479
02:45:11,120 --> 02:45:11,840
Hey!

480
02:45:12,480 --> 02:45:13,840
Weaning 101 done!

481
02:45:14,600 --> 02:45:15,640
Hey bartender!

482
02:45:16,200 --> 02:45:16,960
Four shots please...

483
02:45:17,360 --> 02:45:18,200
It's on me girls.

484
02:45:18,480 --> 02:45:19,200
Thanks.

485
02:45:19,320 --> 02:45:20,720
Cheers, ladies.
-There you are.

486
02:45:21,320 --> 02:45:21,960
Thank you.

487
02:45:22,680 --> 02:45:23,480
To freedom.

488
02:45:23,880 --> 02:45:24,720
To freedom.

489
02:45:31,640 --> 02:45:32,960
Four more shots please!

490
02:45:35,560 --> 02:45:38,400
To freedom again!

491
02:45:38,480 --> 02:45:39,480
Cheers ladies...

492
02:45:41,960 --> 02:45:43,120
That'll be four thousand.

493
02:45:43,560 --> 02:45:44,080
Oh.

494
02:45:44,160 --> 02:45:45,200
Do I pay right away?

495
02:45:45,320 --> 02:45:45,920
Yes.

496
02:45:46,880 --> 02:45:47,800
I don't trust you lot.

497
02:45:47,880 --> 02:45:49,080
You're saying that?

498
02:45:49,160 --> 02:45:50,480
The owner of 'Fuck Bar'?

499
02:45:52,160 --> 02:45:53,960
Jeh was such a dog!

500
02:45:54,080 --> 02:45:54,600
God!

501
02:45:54,960 --> 02:45:56,200
Because of?

502
02:45:56,320 --> 02:45:57,800
Myra!

503
02:46:01,040 --> 02:46:01,640
Jeh...

504
02:46:02,120 --> 02:46:03,040
You forgot about this.

505
02:46:06,360 --> 02:46:07,320
You can have it back!

506
02:46:11,560 --> 02:46:14,120
A little bigger and maybe
she wouldn't have returned it.

507
02:46:16,680 --> 02:46:17,440
The diamond.

508
02:46:19,120 --> 02:46:20,760
It's so small I can't
even get a grip on it.

509
02:46:24,680 --> 02:46:25,520
Here you go.

510
02:46:25,840 --> 02:46:26,720
You know I don't share.

511
02:46:26,800 --> 02:46:28,440
Try it, seriously.

512
02:46:28,520 --> 02:46:30,440
It's from the mountains,
you will not regret it.

513
02:46:30,960 --> 02:46:32,960
Trust me.

514
02:46:33,040 --> 02:46:34,120
Go for it.

515
02:46:40,840 --> 02:46:41,360
You know what?

516
02:46:41,440 --> 02:46:43,800
I had completely forgotten
about this Myra...

517
02:46:49,680 --> 02:46:51,120
Hey, give me that.

518
02:46:51,200 --> 02:46:55,120
Oh my god!
Oh my god!

519
02:46:55,200 --> 02:46:56,360
Hello there friend.

520
02:46:56,760 --> 02:46:58,080
It's been a long time.

521
02:47:02,920 --> 02:47:05,440
What are the happening
places out here?

522
02:47:05,520 --> 02:47:06,240
My office.

523
02:47:06,320 --> 02:47:08,120
I don't even have time
to brush.

524
02:47:08,840 --> 02:47:10,880
Listen, why don't you
guys come with me for...

525
02:47:10,960 --> 02:47:13,080
...Falguni's Dandiya Night
at GD Somani?

526
02:47:13,160 --> 02:47:14,520
All of SoBo will be there.

527
02:47:15,080 --> 02:47:16,040
What's SoBo?

528
02:47:17,160 --> 02:47:18,000
SoBo?

529
02:47:18,080 --> 02:47:18,920
South Bombay.

530
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:20,040
Where we are right now.

531
02:47:20,400 --> 02:47:22,800
Isn't this South Mumbai?

532
02:47:22,880 --> 02:47:24,720
Shouldn't it be SoMu?

533
02:47:25,800 --> 02:47:26,680
SoMu?

534
02:47:26,760 --> 02:47:27,320
SoMu.

535
02:47:28,920 --> 02:47:30,520
Try telling all the fancies that.

536
02:47:31,320 --> 02:47:32,600
Hey, can I try that?

537
02:47:32,960 --> 02:47:33,600
Sure.

538
02:47:39,440 --> 02:47:40,040
Careful...

539
02:47:40,120 --> 02:47:40,800
Water?

540
02:47:40,880 --> 02:47:41,600
First time?

541
02:47:43,760 --> 02:47:44,400
By the way,

542
02:47:44,760 --> 02:47:46,640
everyone tells me to...

543
02:47:46,720 --> 02:47:48,120
...dress appropriately but...

544
02:47:48,920 --> 02:47:51,840
You are also dressed
in full pink so...

545
02:47:52,400 --> 02:47:52,880
I mean...

546
02:47:52,960 --> 02:47:54,800
I had gone to
someone's funeral.

547
02:47:55,400 --> 02:47:56,080
In that?

548
02:47:57,560 --> 02:47:59,720
It was Julie Didi's funeral.

549
02:47:59,800 --> 02:48:02,600
She had given me a similar
dress on my 12th birthday.

550
02:48:02,680 --> 02:48:04,080
Your sister passed away?

551
02:48:04,160 --> 02:48:06,440
I'm so sorry.
-No, she was my nanny.

552
02:48:06,520 --> 02:48:08,560
You address your granny
as sister?

553
02:48:09,400 --> 02:48:10,200
No.

554
02:48:10,280 --> 02:48:12,760
Nanny.
Like Farida Jalal in K3G?

555
02:48:12,840 --> 02:48:13,520
The nanny?

556
02:48:15,160 --> 02:48:16,760
She's the one who raised me.

557
02:48:17,160 --> 02:48:18,960
My actual mom is a witch.

558
02:48:20,880 --> 02:48:22,480
Everyone needs a...

559
02:48:22,560 --> 02:48:24,320
...witch in their life.

560
02:48:24,760 --> 02:48:26,000
Otherwise, how would
we appreciate...

561
02:48:26,080 --> 02:48:27,960
...the rest of our lives?

562
02:48:32,600 --> 02:48:33,240
It's locked.

563
02:48:33,960 --> 02:48:35,680
It's locked guys!
I have to pee!

564
02:48:35,760 --> 02:48:36,440
Really?

565
02:48:37,320 --> 02:48:38,840
Hang on, one second...

566
02:48:39,520 --> 02:48:41,640
Oh shit, it's actually locked.
-Open the door!

567
02:48:42,440 --> 02:48:43,920
I have to go to the bathroom!

568
02:48:44,600 --> 02:48:45,760
Open the door!

569
02:48:45,840 --> 02:48:46,560
Hello!

570
02:48:47,200 --> 02:48:48,200
Hello, Jeh?

571
02:48:48,600 --> 02:48:50,440
Anyone there?
-I have to pee!

572
02:48:50,840 --> 02:48:51,440
Shit!

573
02:48:51,520 --> 02:48:52,120
Hello!

574
02:48:52,600 --> 02:48:53,240
I really have to pee...

575
02:48:53,320 --> 02:48:55,360
I cannot die!

576
02:49:03,800 --> 02:49:04,800
Woah...

577
02:49:13,560 --> 02:49:14,560
Oh my God!

578
02:49:26,840 --> 02:49:27,720
Ooh...

579
02:49:28,560 --> 02:49:29,520
That was interesting.

580
02:49:29,840 --> 02:49:30,720
You guys...

581
02:49:31,560 --> 02:49:32,760
Party time!

582
02:49:33,520 --> 02:49:34,520
Go Anjana!

583
02:49:34,600 --> 02:49:35,960
Go, go, go!

584
02:49:40,360 --> 02:49:43,240
This night shall be
immortalized.

585
02:49:43,320 --> 02:49:44,520
The night we said...

586
02:49:44,600 --> 02:49:46,480
...fuck you to the whole world...

587
02:49:46,560 --> 02:49:48,080
...in Fuck Bar!

588
02:49:48,160 --> 02:49:51,480
Whoo!

589
02:49:55,920 --> 02:49:56,440
Oh wait...

590
02:49:58,480 --> 02:49:59,000
Hello?

591
02:49:59,720 --> 02:50:00,200
Yes?

592
02:50:01,560 --> 02:50:02,040
Yes?

593
02:50:04,280 --> 02:50:04,880
Yes...

594
02:50:06,120 --> 02:50:07,200
Of...of course.

595
02:50:09,320 --> 02:50:10,160
Thanks Uma.

596
02:50:10,480 --> 02:50:11,400
Thank you!

597
02:50:11,480 --> 02:50:14,440
I got it! I got it! I got it!

598
02:50:15,160 --> 02:50:16,240
What did you get?

599
02:50:16,320 --> 02:50:17,680
The funding for my start-up!

600
02:50:17,760 --> 02:50:18,600
Oh my God!

601
02:50:19,240 --> 02:50:20,360
I need a lawyer!

602
02:50:21,920 --> 02:50:22,960
I'm a lawyer.

603
02:50:23,800 --> 02:50:24,480
Are you good?

604
02:50:25,320 --> 02:50:26,600
The best one!

605
02:50:26,680 --> 02:50:27,400
You're hired.

606
02:50:29,520 --> 02:50:31,040
Hey, what the fuck is
going on here?

607
02:50:31,120 --> 02:50:33,560
I'm a start-up founder
as of thirty seconds.

608
02:50:34,240 --> 02:50:35,960
I'm getting divorced!

609
02:50:36,040 --> 02:50:36,680
And I hope you have a...

610
02:50:36,760 --> 02:50:38,880
...super, super, super strong
floor cleaner 'cause...

611
02:50:39,840 --> 02:50:41,920
Does anyone know of a
decent place...

612
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:43,200
...where I can spend the night?

613
02:50:43,640 --> 02:50:46,800
502, Sagar Samrat,
Nepeansea Road, Bombay 36.

614
02:50:47,240 --> 02:50:48,760
I just need to spend
the night.

615
02:50:48,840 --> 02:50:49,800
Not apply for a PAN Card.

616
02:50:50,360 --> 02:50:51,880
I'm charging you
girls for all of that.

617
02:50:53,200 --> 02:50:54,440
On the contrary,

618
02:50:54,520 --> 02:50:58,280
under section 498A and 509...

619
02:50:58,360 --> 02:51:00,760
...of the Indian penal
code for women's safety...

620
02:51:00,840 --> 02:51:03,520
...we could sue you for
physical and mental torture.

621
02:51:03,600 --> 02:51:05,040
It's an unsafe...

622
02:51:05,120 --> 02:51:06,480
Fuck Bar!

623
02:51:07,080 --> 02:51:08,160
What the hell!

624
02:51:08,240 --> 02:51:08,680
What's your problem?

625
02:51:08,760 --> 02:51:10,160
Why are you calling my bar
Fuck Bar?

626
02:51:10,240 --> 02:51:11,920
This is what we want to
ask you.

627
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:14,440
Why did you choose
this name?

628
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:15,640
It's...

629
02:51:15,960 --> 02:51:17,080
...Truck Bar.

630
02:51:17,160 --> 02:51:18,880
That's not what the sign says.

631
02:51:20,240 --> 02:51:20,720
Fuck!

632
02:51:21,240 --> 02:51:22,840
Exactly!

633
02:51:24,320 --> 02:51:25,040
Myra!

634
02:51:30,960 --> 02:51:31,720
Oh.

635
02:51:34,120 --> 02:51:35,240
It's the smell of henna.

636
02:51:35,320 --> 02:51:37,120
There's a wedding going
on around here somewhere.

637
02:51:44,480 --> 02:51:45,080
Sure.

638
02:51:47,280 --> 02:51:48,040
Jeh...

639
02:51:48,400 --> 02:51:50,080
What happened to that Myra?

640
02:51:50,160 --> 02:51:50,880
Deleted.

641
02:51:51,520 --> 02:51:53,160
From my phone book,
my Facebook,

642
02:51:53,240 --> 02:51:54,320
my bar accounts book.

643
02:51:54,400 --> 02:51:55,200
Everything.

644
02:51:55,280 --> 02:51:56,480
So many books...

645
02:51:56,560 --> 02:51:57,360
And memory?

646
02:51:58,560 --> 02:51:59,640
Why Myra suddenly?

647
02:52:00,040 --> 02:52:01,840
We were just discussing
how we met.

648
02:52:02,400 --> 02:52:03,720
Ah right!

649
02:52:03,800 --> 02:52:05,360
That night when
I locked you girls out here.

650
02:52:05,440 --> 02:52:06,080
What?

651
02:52:06,640 --> 02:52:08,040
Fucking crazy drunk girls.

652
02:52:08,120 --> 02:52:09,600
It was you?! Jeh!
-What did you say?!

653
02:52:09,680 --> 02:52:10,560
Hey hold on, hold on.

654
02:52:10,640 --> 02:52:13,760
Later I realized that
crazy drunk girls are the best.

655
02:52:13,840 --> 02:52:14,720
Big hearts...

656
02:52:14,800 --> 02:52:15,600
...and big bills.

657
02:52:15,680 --> 02:52:17,680
I can't believe this guy!

658
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:19,800
Jeh! How dare you!

659
02:52:19,880 --> 02:52:21,280
Where do you think
you're going!

660
02:52:21,360 --> 02:52:22,240
Stop!

661
02:52:22,320 --> 02:52:23,120
It was you!

662
02:52:56,560 --> 02:52:57,840
I fucking love you too.

663
02:53:17,400 --> 02:53:18,320
Arjun.

664
02:53:21,440 --> 02:53:22,360
Arjun.

665
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:26,920
Arjun.

666
02:53:45,360 --> 02:53:46,800
Fuck.
