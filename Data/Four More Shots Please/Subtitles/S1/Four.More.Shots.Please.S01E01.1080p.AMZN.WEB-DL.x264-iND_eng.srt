1
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,400
Labels don't define us.

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,280
Actually, a woman can be
all of this.

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,160
And all in one day.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,680
P.S. None of these words
shame us.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,320
I can extensively elaborate on the
prolific successes of Investigator.com...

6
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,680
...but as you can see here,

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,640
the numbers speak for themselves.

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,040
I mean, not literally of course!

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,440
As we all know,
numbers are highly marginalised.

10
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,400
And since they can’t speak
for themselves,

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,640
we have to speak up for them.

12
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,520
As must we speak
for the millions of others...

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,400
...who cannot go
and protest at Jantar Mantar.

14
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,560
AC please!

15
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,160
It’s centrally air conditioned.

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,280
So why am I so damn hot?

17
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,120
Yes, Damini Rizvi Roy...

18
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,680
why are you so damn hot?

19
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,880
Ms. Arya Menon Khanna, I'm not driving
back home to get Mr. Buttoo for you.

20
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,520
But mama, how Mr. Buttoo will sleep?

21
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,440
Panda bear hug and sleep.

22
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,600
I will hug him and sleep, okay?

23
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,800
Let's go.

24
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,840
Dadda!!!

25
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,240
Wow. Your place looks
nice and clean...

26
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,080
New maid?

27
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:00,880
Why?

28
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,320
Am I not capable of this?

29
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,560
Sure.

30
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,480
Arya baby, no orange bar...
You know the rules, right?

31
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,720
But Dadda said Dadda's
house is fun house no rules.

32
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,600
Yup...no rules.

33
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,560
And if her teeth rot, who
will take her to the dentist? You?

34
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,120
Yes, I will take her.

35
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,480
And in any case Mom,
these are my milk teeth...

36
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,800
...and very soon the tooth-fairy
will arrive to take them away.

37
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,680
So don't worry.
Say bye to Mama.

38
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,600
Bye.

39
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,800
Now bye.

40
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,640
Bye, Mama.

41
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,160
Bye, Mama.
-Bye, bye.

42
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,480
Bye bye.

43
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,400
Devil card?

44
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,400
What have you been up to, Siddhi?

45
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,560
It's no wonder
you can't find a guy.

46
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,920
Relax Sneha, it's upside down.
It's a positive card.

47
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,760
Siddhi has nothing to worry about.

48
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,400
Abundance is coming.
It's a period of harvest.

49
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,680
I can only see happiness.

50
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,680
All that's wonderful, but...

51
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,160
...when will she get married?

52
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,920
In the Lunar New Year, Sneha!

53
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,360
Wait and watch post Diwali!
You'll be surprised at the turn of events!

54
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,560
And, if there's a problem,
I always have a solution for that.

55
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,400
I've got diamonds for prosperity.
I've got rubies for love.

56
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,480
And I've got emerald for tranquility.

57
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,480
C'mon, let's go! Sweat!
Yeah let's go!

58
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,320
C'mon! Sweaty Swati! Let's go!
C'mon! Core tight...

59
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,960
Let's go! Up! C'mon!
Abs tight! Let's go, very nice!

60
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,440
C'mon! Awesome!
Good job!

61
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,600
Very sexy! C'mon!
Push!

62
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,640
The countdown begins here!
Let's go! Let's go! C'mon uncle!

63
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,120
Let's go!

64
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,160
It's still extremely itchy.

65
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,680
Hasn't got better since last week.

66
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,440
Has your partner complained
of the same problem?

67
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,800
I wish...

68
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,720
I mean I wish I had a partner.

69
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,240
Not that he'd be itchy too.

70
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,240
I don't really have a partner.

71
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,520
By a partner,
I don't mean 'a' partner.

72
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,360
As in, I don't have multiple
partners or anything.

73
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,720
Not that I judge people who do.

74
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,440
It's totally fine.

75
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,120
I'm not a prude.

76
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,440
But really, where are the nice men?
And where can one find them?

77
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,800
At the hospital?

78
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,240
Sorry, what was the question again?

79
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:12,920
Nothing!

80
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,360
You may get dressed now.

81
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,360
Just like last time,
I don't see any infection.

82
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,680
Don't worry.

83
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,640
Everything will be absolutely fine. And...

84
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,520
...feel free to take the sanitizer home.

85
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,920
BATHE THREE TIMES DAILY.

86
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,560
You know this is your future
we're talking about right?

87
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,240
You could pay a little attention...

88
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,760
Yes, Mummy.

89
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,080
Supercool Bro!

90
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,680
C'mon guys, let's go!
Three more! Let's go!

91
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,800
Ladies...

92
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,280
Yes! Alright!

93
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,760
Kick it in the balls!

94
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,640
Huh?

95
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,720
That means kick it in the balls!

96
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,360
Kick it in the balls!

97
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,680
Jeh, lime.

98
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,960
Too strong for you?

99
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,680
You ladies need anything else?

100
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,800
Well, I know what I want...

101
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,840
...but the question is...

102
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,480
...will you give it to me?

103
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,000
Ooh!

104
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,080
Ask me again in a year.

105
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,800
Till then...

106
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,120
...lemons.

107
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,720
Jeh...now can I get my
Pink Lady cocktail please?

108
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,280
No sissy cocktails, ladies.

109
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,120
You know the bar rules.
Exactly!

110
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,240
Okay, okay...

111
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,360
So the hot Doc, some old
fogeys and the long conference table.

112
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,640
Then what happened?

113
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,880
Then I came.

114
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,800
Damn. I was expecting an orgy!
Please...

115
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,680
Seriously Anj,
porn is free on the internet.

116
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,160
Guys, I have a kid.

117
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,560
Honestly,
I don't even get time to poop.

118
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,280
I am living vicariously
through you guys, man.

119
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,840
Okay, so anyway...how
was your appointment with Dr. Drool?

120
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,640
Okay. So I was lying
there with my legs wide apart.

121
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,120
Of course.
And thinking...

122
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,640
...how big is his penis.

123
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,600
Because he seems to have a long
tongue. Like an unusually long tongue.

124
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,760
So I'm wondering if he
likes to go down on women.

125
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,600
And ooh...that's cold.

126
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,800
Is it the clamp or is
it his unusually long fingers.

127
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,640
And then he told me...

128
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,760
What?

129
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,560
Yeah?

130
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,320
To take a bath three times a day.
-Wait, what?

131
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,680
You mean with him, right?

132
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,880
Can I join in too?

133
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,240
Umang, always!

134
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,440
You always take it to another level!

135
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,280
Okay guys,
get your lehengas and saris ready...

136
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,480
...because end of the
year I'm getting married!

137
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,640
You found someone?

138
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,200
Sneha's tarot card reader has said
I'll find someone by Diwali.

139
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,440
Dude, how do you people get married
like this? Without a test-drive?

140
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,080
I'm not buying a car.
I'm getting married!

141
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,760
Ya...but I just think,
at least lose your virginity first...

142
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,400
...and then you can
marry and get destroyed.

143
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,760
You do what you like.

144
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,720
Can you leave my private
parts alone, please?

145
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,360
Okay, sorry.
-Tell me something Siddhi..

146
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,960
You put in so much effort
into your wedding resume.

147
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,640
If you put that same
effort into a career...

148
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,360
...imagine how far ahead
in life you'd be by now.

149
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,280
What's the point?

150
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,640
I'll have to quit everything
after marriage anyway so...

151
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,840
Do you know the root
cause for a divorce?

152
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,400
What?

153
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,640
Marriage.

154
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,840
My advice...

155
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,440
...don't get married!

156
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,720
She's one of those people who eat
non-vegetarian food their whole life...

157
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,640
...and then suddenly turn vegan.

158
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,720
You've had your life experiences.

159
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,760
Now let me have mine.

160
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,240
Sneha!

161
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,040
Why do you always remember
your mum when you're piss drunk?!

162
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,120
Keep flying high my bitches!

163
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,120
Okay, bye.

164
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,040
Good night ladies.
What? You're not coming?

165
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,840
No, I'll walk back in a bit.

166
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,320
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.

167
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,840
Okay, bye.

168
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,080
Bye.

169
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,880
Bye, Jeh.
-Get home safe.

170
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,280
You're staying?
-Ya...

171
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,160
Do you want a drink?
-Sure.

172
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,840
Cleaning up alone?

173
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,880
Yeah, my boy Bosco had to leave early.

174
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,240
It's alright.

175
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,360
Do you want some help?

176
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,040
Not really.

177
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,360
Okay.

178
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,840
Cheers.

179
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,080
Okay, c'mon back Ms.Roy.

180
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,480
What?

181
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,840
Nothing.

182
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,280
Carry on.

183
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,600
What the fuck!

184
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,880
Hahahaha...wow. So funny.

185
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,360
Happy 3 year anniversary Jeh!

186
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,240
The sign said FUCK for
just 5 minutes that day.

187
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,720
Will you girls ever let it go?

188
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,000
How about never?
Is 'never' good for you?

189
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,280
You girls met in this bar,

190
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,760
because of this bar.

191
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,240
Show some respect, ladies.

192
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,400
Respect, bro!

193
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,080
Bye, Jeh.

194
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,840
I said I’ll take care of it.

195
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,800
Eight consecutive defamation suits Damini?

196
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,000
Apologies and retractions.

197
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,600
That’s all we publish on the site now!

198
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,040
And where are the readers?

199
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,840
Our audience doesn't want to
read these heavy exposes.

200
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,800
But this is not some advertising agency.

201
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,920
We are a news site.

202
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,960
We go after the truth. Not the audience!

203
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,480
One more mistake
and we’ll be running in losses.

204
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,760
This site will shut down.

205
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,480
This time...

206
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,200
...we won’t lose the case.

207
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,360
We won’t.

208
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,720
Now, if you’ll excuse me,
my lawyer’s waiting for me.

209
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,120
Thank you.

210
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,200
C'mon! Go, go, go! Let's go!

211
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,680
C'mon! C'mon!

212
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,200
Asshole!

213
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,320
Mama, what is asshole?

214
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,160
Very, very bad word sweetheart.

215
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,000
And Mama is very bad
for using it.

216
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,920
But Mama, what it means?

217
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,760
It means your bumsy.

218
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,760
I like my bumsy.

219
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,280
And I love your bumsy, okay?

220
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,040
Come.

221
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,440
Bye, have a good day!

222
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,840
Good morning, Arya!

223
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,560
Asshole. Asshole. Asshole.

224
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,320
Poor thing. She's a divorcee.

225
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,200
First she couldn't control her husband.

226
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,360
And now her poor kid.

227
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,640
Are you sure you got this?
This is make or break.

228
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,840
Chill.

229
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,640
State Vs. Investigator.com

230
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,720
Tell me..

231
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,840
What is this case?

232
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,240
The respected Transport Minister...

233
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,640
...has filed a defamation
case against Investigator.com...

234
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,400
...and today is the second hearing.

235
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,280
Speak.

236
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,240
Yes, your Honor.
My client Ms. Damini Rizvi Roy...

237
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,440
That's a pretty long name
much like Amar Akbar Anthony.

238
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,320
Your honor, this is a simple case
of harassment by the complainants.

239
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,200
My client is entitled to
journalistic freedoms...

240
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,360
Madam...

241
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,480
Where are we?

242
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,800
Sorry?

243
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,200
Where are we?

244
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,480
In Mumbai.

245
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,040
Where is Mumbai?

246
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,360
In Maharashtra.

247
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,120
Then let's speak in Marathi?

248
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,800
Your Honor, I don't know Marathi.

249
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,560
May I please speak in English?

250
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,720
Speak...

251
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,160
Speak in any language
you know but make it quick.

252
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,560
I have to finish hearing
three cases before lunch.

253
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,000
Speak...

254
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,920
What has this girl written...

255
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,720
Girl?

256
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,440
...to make the Minister this angry?

257
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,760
Why wouldn't he lose his temper?

258
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,280
They don't have a single piece
of evidence or witness.

259
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,120
They make false claims in court.

260
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,320
They are lying.

261
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,320
Why wouldn't he be livid?

262
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,440
Your Honor, all the witness testimonials...

263
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,640
...and the sting operation...

264
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,480
...conducted on the contractor...

265
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,760
...has been submitted to you.

266
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,920
Where is the witness?

267
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,760
They would be here if they existed!

268
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,760
All the witnesses have turned hostile.

269
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,560
From intimidation to bribes.

270
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,360
They have stopped at nothing,
your Honor.

271
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,440
There's a mention of
some contractor in this case?

272
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,680
Yes.
-No.

273
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,280
I mean...there was.

274
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,040
He died last year.

275
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,480
How?
-Dengue.

276
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,200
Honestly speaking, your Honor...

277
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,280
...there is no merit in this case.

278
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,000
This is just another publicity stunt,
that's all.

279
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,760
Your honor, if you can give
me a chance to prove to you that my...

280
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,800
Madam...

281
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,600
Now it's my turn to speak.

282
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,480
In Hindi.

283
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,320
Due to the lack of
evidence and witnesses...

284
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,720
...the court rules
in favor of the Minister.

285
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,840
What?

286
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,320
And instructs Ms. Rizvi Roy
to publish...

287
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,960
...a written apology on her website.

288
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,200
What the fuck!

289
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,640
And as defamation penalty,
she will pay...

290
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,120
...one million to the
Minister this month.

291
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,760
Thank you.

292
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,520
Next.

293
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,560
What just happened?

294
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,080
Did we just lose the case?

295
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,880
Don't worry,
I'll file the appeal on Monday.

296
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,360
You know what,
I think if you were a man...

297
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,240
...the judge wouldn't
have been so condescending.

298
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,680
Well, welcome to my world.

299
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,840
Men. Men. Men.

300
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,280
Just look at the
number of men around us.

301
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,120
In India,
all we see are men everywhere.

302
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,800
Like this,
staring away at us all the time.

303
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,560
In buses, in rickshaws, in court...

304
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,480
Peeing on the streets...

305
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,040
See...

306
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,160
Just fuckin' men everywhere!

307
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,720
Okay, tell me what's the
difference between men and condoms.

308
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,160
What?

309
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,240
Condoms have changed.

310
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,280
They are no longer
thick and insensitive.

311
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,640
Anj, that's really sexist.

312
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,760
2000 years of patriarchy, man.

313
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,560
They can bloody well take one joke!
-That's true.

314
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,480
Aunty, ball!

315
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,200
Anj. He called you aunty.

316
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,360
Dee, you caught the ball.
You are the aunty.

317
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,360
But you're the one with a kid.
You're the aunty!

318
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,880
It's not written on my face.
You could be a mom too!

319
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,960
Aunty, ball.

320
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:03,880
There you go.

321
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,360
Here's your ball!

322
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,360
Dee, you're so mean.

323
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,400
So mean!

324
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,080
Okay Ravi, see you tomorrow.
And please, be on time.

325
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,000
Thanks.

326
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,840
How long will you
torture the poor souls..

327
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,040
They love it...

328
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,080
...as do you.

329
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,800
I did.

330
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,520
I have a girlfriend now.

331
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,280
She must be really tiny
which is why I can't see her.

332
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,560
Very funny.

333
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,040
Amit...you've just wilfully
imprisoned yourself.

334
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,680
Break the chains, dude.

335
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,920
Do Re Me Fa So...

336
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,880
Do Re Me Fa So...

337
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,920
Do Re Me Fa So...

338
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,280
Do Re Me Fa So...

339
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,080
Siddhi, back straight please.

340
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,080
And stomach in.

341
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,040
Am I to sing from
my stomach or my throat?

342
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,720
But ma'am,
she was singing correctly.

343
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,240
Oh, was she now professor?

344
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,480
Are you aware of the
competition in this city?

345
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,760
All the single girls
are chasing the same four boys!

346
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,000
The boy has to fall in love
with her.

347
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,760
On the first note.

348
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,160
Or else, she'll be spending
the rest of her life here.

349
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,080
Okay Siddhi, sing freely.

350
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,280
Oh great!

351
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,160
Professor, bring another
instrument next time.

352
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,680
Yes ma'am.

353
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,400
Back straight...

354
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,800
Stomach in...

355
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,760
Radha...

356
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:03,760
Yes ma'am...

357
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,000
Pull out the clothes that
Arya's going to wear...

358
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,080
Wow, baby. That's beautiful.

359
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,880
You made it at Dadda's?

360
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:21,920
Yes.

361
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,400
Okay, so this is Mama,
Dadda, Arya and...

362
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,480
Radha?

363
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,080
No, Kavya aunty.

364
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,080
Kavya aunty?

365
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,280
Yes, Dadda's friend.

366
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,880
She made rice pancakes
for breakfast...

367
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,960
Yummy.

368
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,760
Rice pancake...

369
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,080
She was there for breakfast?

370
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,800
Yes.

371
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,560
I love rice pancakes...
much more than jam and toast.

372
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,800
Really baby?

373
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,720
Since when have you
started liking rice pancakes?

374
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,240
You know when I gave it to you
as a baby...

375
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,960
...you spat it out all over me.

376
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,960
But I love now.

377
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,960
She put honey on top.

378
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,400
Yummy, yummy.

379
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,800
Yes, baby.
You said that already!

380
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,920
Go and get ready now.

381
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,480
What's up?
Hi.

382
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,080
Arya's ready?

383
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,400
She is almost ready.

384
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,320
Oh shit, I'm starving...

385
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,000
Still leaving her crusts.

386
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,160
Was she there for breakfast?

387
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,080
Who?
-Your new friend.

388
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,280
Kavya or something?

389
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,320
I think.

390
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,800
Kavs?

391
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,000
Ya...

392
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,040
Did she spend the night or what?

393
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,560
Spend the night or what?
No she didn't.

394
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,520
She just came for breakfast,
to meet Arya.

395
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,280
That's it.

396
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,480
I would really appreciate
if you checked with me...

397
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,760
...before introducing
Arya to new people.

398
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,200
You know she's still adjusting
to our divorce and...

399
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,800
...new people will just confuse her.

400
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,400
She's still adjusting to our divorce?

401
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,240
Ya.

402
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,040
Wow. That's crazy...
I mean...

403
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,560
...cause we separated
when she was 6 months old...

404
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,800
...and our divorce came
in when Arya was about one so...

405
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,280
If anything, God forbid you
and I have to start living together?

406
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,520
Then she will have to adjust.

407
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,520
So I think you can chill on that one.

408
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,440
And since we are talking about it,
I've been meaning to tell you that...

409
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,760
...Kavs and I are getting
pretty serious now.

410
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,560
Okay.

411
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,080
Dadda!
Hi, my sweetheart!

412
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,760
How are you?
Fine.

413
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,440
Ready to go?

414
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,680
Yes.

415
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,560
Mama, we go?

416
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,080
Ya.

417
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,400
Let's go.

418
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,160
Bye, Mama!
Bye, baby.

419
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,040
Give Mama a kiss.

420
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,640
Okay, bye.

421
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,760
Excuse me, ma'am.

422
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,720
Please wipe down the
treadmill once you get off.

423
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,120
No one wants to have
sweat babies with you!

424
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,000
Excuse me, ma'am!

425
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:32,880
Me?

426
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,480
I'm so sorry.

427
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,720
I didn't mean to...
-No, no, no.

428
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,120
I was just...
-It's alright. Not a problem.

429
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,040
Let me do it.
-It's done.

430
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,040
No, it's okay.
I got it.

431
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,440
No...I'm so sorry.

432
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,520
No, no.
No, no, it's okay.

433
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,520
Oh my god! Are you okay?

434
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,360
Ya...I'm fine.
-Okay.

435
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,880
It's fine. It's fine.

436
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,160
Sure?
-Ya...

437
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,120
Can I have my towel?

438
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,480
Okay.

439
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,440
Thank you.

440
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,280
You know who she is right?

441
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,840
That's Bollywood
Goddess Samara Kapoor.

442
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,960
And you gave her an earful.

443
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,640
Vaibhav...

444
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,400
Where’s the final draft on
the pharma story?

445
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,760
I thought you had locked it.

446
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,720
It didn't pass legal Damini.
The board didn't sign off on it.

447
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,400
Apparently, it’s too defamatory.

448
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,400
Well, last I checked I was still
the Editor-in-Chief of Investigator.com.

449
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,920
So I say it’s on!

450
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,440
Okay. As you say, boss.
I’ll mail it to the web team right away.

451
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,520
The Board needs to grow a pair of balls
if they want to be in the news business!

452
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,240
The board has started
censoring my stories.

453
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,240
Scared of some fucking lawsuits,
little sissies!

454
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,200
Sneha's put me onto Keto again.

455
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,120
So no rice,
no sugar, no bread, no life.

456
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,240
There's a Kavya.

457
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,680
Varun is apparently
very serious about her.

458
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,560
I yelled at THE Samara
Kapoor in the gym today...

459
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,040
...and I kept saying 'Sorry!
It's alright, it's alright'

460
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,000
...like it's some new
Punjabi pop track! I mean...

461
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,720
...what a fucked up week man!

462
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,880
What a fucked up week man!

463
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,240
What a killer night!
What's with the sulk ladies?

464
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,360
Four shots.

465
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,080
On me ladies!
C'mon let's go!

466
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,240
We have no time to waste…

467
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,880
Give me four more shots please!

468
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,320
People can say what they want…
I don’t give a damn...

469
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,880
…I’ll do what I want to do.

470
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,440
A little attraction…
and a little more action…

471
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,040
Hello Mister, how do you do!

472
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,680
My habits…
are a little wicked…

473
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,200
That’s why I’m checkin’ out you…

474
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,840
A little attraction…
and a little more action…

475
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,280
Hello Mister, how do you do.

476
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,440
Mr Bartender, please…

477
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,800
Shake it baby,
shake a drink for me…

478
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,920
Give me four more shots
for me...

479
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,800
and my ladies!

480
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,240
Let’s forget formalities…

481
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,640
Give me four more shots please!

482
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,040
We have no time to waste…

483
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,320
Give me four more shots please!

484
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,760
Never say never when we’re together…

485
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,920
Anything goes baby.

486
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,640
Let’s forget formalities…

487
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,160
Give me four more shots please!

488
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,760
Uh oh here we go ladies…

489
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,320
Uh oh here we go again…

490
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,200
Uh oh here we go…

491
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,600
Give me four more shots please!

492
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,520
Look who's here...

493
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,760
What?

494
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,600
I had to pee.
Of course.

495
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,680
Jeh! Four for the road!

496
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,520
Please!
