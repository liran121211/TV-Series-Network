1
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,320
Why is it that...

2
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:46,160
...we find it hardest to stand up
to the person we love the most?

3
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:48,840
Is it because we’re scared
of hurting them?

4
01:52:49,520 --> 01:52:51,000
Or hurting ourselves?

5
01:52:55,560 --> 01:52:57,360
I wandered lonely as a cloud...

6
01:52:57,720 --> 01:52:59,320
...that floats so high...
-Ready?

7
01:53:00,600 --> 01:53:01,440
Siddhi...

8
01:53:02,080 --> 01:53:03,040
...what is this?

9
01:53:03,120 --> 01:53:04,720
Julie Didi's birthday gift.

10
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:05,640
Take it off now!

11
01:53:05,720 --> 01:53:07,440
You look like a
three-tiered birthday cake!

12
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:08,440
No!

13
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:09,960
What do you mean no?

14
01:53:10,040 --> 01:53:12,840
Julie! I mean...
-What is going on here?

15
01:53:12,920 --> 01:53:13,880
This is what is going
on Viju!

16
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:15,560
She looks like a
strawberry meringue!

17
01:53:15,640 --> 01:53:17,280
You know I need this
evening to be perfect.

18
01:53:17,360 --> 01:53:20,200
I have to prove to these
people that we're a perfect family.

19
01:53:20,280 --> 01:53:22,040
And now this...
-What are you saying Sneha.

20
01:53:22,120 --> 01:53:23,760
Aren't we already perfect?

21
01:53:24,240 --> 01:53:25,440
Oh please!

22
01:53:28,600 --> 01:53:30,280
Julie, ten minutes.

23
01:53:30,360 --> 01:53:31,160
Change her.

24
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:33,280
Our guests will be here
any minute.

25
01:53:37,400 --> 01:53:39,160
This is important for
your mother.

26
01:53:39,240 --> 01:53:41,000
So let's do this for her.

27
01:53:41,080 --> 01:53:43,760
Quickly change your dress
and come sweetheart.

28
01:53:46,640 --> 01:53:48,880
I wandered lonely
as a cloud...

29
01:53:48,920 --> 01:53:50,560
...that floats all high...

30
01:53:50,680 --> 01:53:52,520
...over valleys and hills.

31
01:53:52,920 --> 01:53:54,080
When all at once...

32
01:53:54,160 --> 01:53:55,840
...I saw a crowd...

33
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:58,640
...a host of golden daffodils.

34
01:53:58,720 --> 01:53:59,880
Besides the lake...

35
01:53:59,920 --> 01:54:01,400
...beneath the trees...

36
01:54:01,480 --> 01:54:03,120
...fluttering and dancing...

37
01:54:03,200 --> 01:54:03,800
Whoa!

38
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:07,400
Siddhi!

39
01:54:12,520 --> 01:54:13,400
I'm so sorry.

40
01:55:03,600 --> 01:55:06,240
So this pretty gift is from...

41
01:55:06,320 --> 01:55:07,720
Sejal!

42
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:10,400
Very sweet.
-They're all the same.

43
01:55:10,440 --> 01:55:11,880
Well done Sejal.

44
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:15,120
These botoxed women...

45
01:55:15,800 --> 01:55:18,320
Their eyebrows are
permanently surprised.

46
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:20,880
When I break our news
 to them...

47
01:55:21,280 --> 01:55:23,600
...their eyebrows
will fly off their faces.

48
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:27,560
If you hate them so much,
why are they your friends?

49
01:55:29,360 --> 01:55:30,600
Grow up Siddhi.

50
01:55:30,680 --> 01:55:31,920
That's life.

51
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:33,880
Sometimes you socialise
with people...

52
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:35,320
...even if you don't
like them.

53
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:42,440
??

54
01:55:42,520 --> 01:55:44,440
There she is!

55
01:55:45,200 --> 01:55:46,400
Congratulations.
-Thank you.

56
01:55:46,480 --> 01:55:47,880
Congratulations darling.

57
01:55:47,960 --> 01:55:49,720
Thank you.
And you look lovely.

58
01:55:49,800 --> 01:55:50,800
Thank you Aunty.

59
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:53,440
And ladies...
I have big news.

60
01:55:53,520 --> 01:55:54,720
So do I.

61
01:55:55,240 --> 01:55:56,880
You know my nephew Pavan?

62
01:55:57,400 --> 01:55:59,160
He just got engaged.

63
01:55:59,800 --> 01:56:00,640
Kinjal Lakhani.

64
01:56:02,040 --> 01:56:04,040
Ms. NRI 2014 runner up!

65
01:56:04,600 --> 01:56:05,240
With her.

66
01:56:05,320 --> 01:56:07,440
Wow!
That's really good news.

67
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:09,880
Siddhi, what did you do that...

68
01:56:09,960 --> 01:56:12,520
...Pavan just got engaged
to the very next girl he met?

69
01:56:13,400 --> 01:56:14,920
Karate chops?

70
01:56:15,960 --> 01:56:18,320
By the way, you know whose
daughter Kinjal is, don't you?

71
01:56:18,640 --> 01:56:20,080
Surpriya and Akash Bhatt.

72
01:56:20,160 --> 01:56:20,800
Oh no.

73
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:23,720
Sneha, wasn't your engagement
with him called off?

74
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:26,560
And didn't your father
gift him a car as good omen?

75
01:56:26,640 --> 01:56:28,280
Then why did the
engagement break Sneha?

76
01:56:29,720 --> 01:56:32,800
Mona, today my Viju's
net worth is...

77
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:34,840
...three times more
than Akash.

78
01:56:35,480 --> 01:56:37,040
And your nephew, Pavan?

79
01:56:37,800 --> 01:56:40,120
I'm sorry to say but he
eats chicken.

80
01:56:40,560 --> 01:56:42,720
I'm thrilled that Siddhi
narrowly escaped him.

81
01:56:43,360 --> 01:56:45,480
In any case,
I believe in destiny.

82
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:47,640
Kuki's son, Mohit?
-Yes?

83
01:56:48,200 --> 01:56:50,280
Siddhi and he clicked
like that.

84
01:56:50,360 --> 01:56:51,800
And you know that
family, right?

85
01:56:51,880 --> 01:56:54,320
Only Mercedes and BMWs.

86
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:57,000
And they have this exquisite
home in Dubai Marina.

87
01:56:57,480 --> 01:57:00,720
Ladies, please save
your dates for December.

88
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:03,720
I will throw Siddhi
a destination wedding...

89
01:57:03,800 --> 01:57:05,480
...no one will ever forget.

90
01:57:05,560 --> 01:57:07,920
He's such a
handsome boy, Mona.

91
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,240
And great personal style.

92
01:57:10,360 --> 01:57:12,800
He does all of Kuki's
personal shopping for her.

93
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:13,480
Really?

94
01:57:13,560 --> 01:57:14,920
Once you two get married,

95
01:57:15,040 --> 01:57:16,920
I'm appointing Mohit
my personal stylist.

96
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:18,800
But Sneha Aunty...

97
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:20,160
Mohit is gay.

98
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:21,760
Isn't he?

99
01:57:30,080 --> 01:57:31,680
How long have you
known this?

100
01:57:32,040 --> 01:57:32,800
Since the beginning.

101
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:37,880
Why Siddhi!

102
01:57:38,680 --> 01:57:41,120
Why do you always embarrass
me in front of others?

103
01:57:42,680 --> 01:57:44,360
Sneha is such a liar.

104
01:57:44,440 --> 01:57:46,480
Do you know why her
engagement broke?

105
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:48,360
Her father gifted Akash
a car alright...

106
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:50,320
...but he hadn't fully
paid for it.

107
01:57:50,360 --> 01:57:51,320
Really?
-Yes.

108
01:58:04,480 --> 01:58:07,040
Why is Mummy so mean,
Julie Didi?

109
01:58:08,360 --> 01:58:09,280
Listen baby,

110
01:58:09,360 --> 01:58:11,640
Madam is always on a diet.

111
01:58:11,720 --> 01:58:14,160
That's why her blood
sugar level is always low.

112
01:58:15,080 --> 01:58:17,720
You know, in our Goa,
there is one saying.

113
01:58:18,360 --> 01:58:20,360
Always hungry means...

114
01:58:20,440 --> 01:58:22,040
...always angry.

115
01:58:26,160 --> 01:58:27,320
See...
My favourite.

116
01:58:27,400 --> 01:58:28,880
Lemon and chocolate!

117
01:58:28,960 --> 01:58:30,560
That's why I made them.

118
01:58:30,640 --> 01:58:32,840
When will you teach
me how to make cupcakes?

119
01:58:32,920 --> 01:58:35,120
The next time Madam
leaves town.

120
01:58:35,440 --> 01:58:36,160
Promise.

121
01:58:38,160 --> 01:58:39,760
I love your cupcakes.

122
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:40,680
I love you.

123
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:42,040
But I hate her.

124
01:58:48,720 --> 01:58:50,480
Hey Sidi-Pidi...

125
01:58:50,560 --> 01:58:51,560
...it's me.

126
01:58:52,200 --> 01:58:53,040
Take this...

127
01:58:53,120 --> 01:58:54,720
Your papa's famous Mojito.

128
01:59:03,640 --> 01:59:05,240
Papa, why did you
marry her?

129
01:59:06,560 --> 01:59:08,920
I wish I was never born.

130
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:09,840
Siddhi, please.

131
01:59:09,920 --> 01:59:11,000
Don't say such things.

132
01:59:11,080 --> 01:59:13,600
Why don't you ever
say anything to Sneha?

133
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:17,640
You know Papa,
mom has never once...

134
01:59:17,720 --> 01:59:19,200
...looked at me
with love.

135
01:59:20,720 --> 01:59:22,760
She's always judging me.

136
01:59:23,840 --> 01:59:25,560
It's like I can never
do anything right.

137
01:59:25,640 --> 01:59:28,080
I'm a perpetual
embarrassment for her.

138
01:59:28,680 --> 01:59:30,240
You know still, every day,

139
01:59:30,320 --> 01:59:32,000
I just wait for her to say...

140
01:59:32,480 --> 01:59:34,160
...I love you Sidi-Pidi.

141
01:59:34,600 --> 01:59:35,640
Like you do.

142
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:38,120
But she's never going
to say it, is she?

143
01:59:38,600 --> 01:59:41,000
You know your mother
sweetheart.

144
01:59:41,520 --> 01:59:43,120
She loves you very much.

145
01:59:43,200 --> 01:59:45,880
But in her own
Sneha Patel style.

146
01:59:45,960 --> 01:59:47,360
Papa, please don't lie
to me.

147
01:59:47,440 --> 01:59:49,320
I swear on your cupcakes.

148
01:59:49,400 --> 01:59:50,280
Now take this...

149
01:59:50,360 --> 01:59:52,520
...our only companion
when we're sad.

150
01:59:52,600 --> 01:59:53,400
I don't want it.

151
01:59:53,480 --> 01:59:54,840
How can you not
want it?

152
01:59:55,200 --> 01:59:57,120
I've made it extra strong
just for you.

153
01:59:58,240 --> 01:59:59,560
Take it quickly.

154
02:00:00,040 --> 02:00:01,120
Drink up...
Come.

155
02:00:03,040 --> 02:00:03,880
Cheers!

156
02:00:04,360 --> 02:00:05,160
Cheers.

157
02:00:09,080 --> 02:00:10,160
Really?

158
02:00:14,520 --> 02:00:16,440
Cheers, darling.
-Cheers.

159
02:00:19,040 --> 02:00:21,040
Oh my God...
Don't do that.

160
02:00:22,200 --> 02:00:24,440
You're not going to
miss me at all.

161
02:00:25,240 --> 02:00:27,240
Here. Xerxes' toys...

162
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:29,400
Did I hear Xerxes?

163
02:00:30,080 --> 02:00:30,920
And...

164
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:32,440
his food bowl...
-I did, didn't I?

165
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:34,840
His favourite blankie,
everything's in here.

166
02:00:35,160 --> 02:00:37,000
Also tell your mum his
favourite is milk bread.

167
02:00:37,080 --> 02:00:38,600
And you have to force
him to drink water...

168
02:00:38,680 --> 02:00:40,120
...otherwise he gets
dehydrated.

169
02:00:40,200 --> 02:00:41,000
Ok?

170
02:00:41,080 --> 02:00:41,920
And also...

171
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:43,360
O how the mighty
have fallen.

172
02:00:43,680 --> 02:00:44,240
What?

173
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:46,240
Ms. Rizvi Roy's in love...

174
02:00:46,600 --> 02:00:48,480
Oh please!
C'mon, out with it.

175
02:00:50,680 --> 02:00:52,880
The minute I wake up,
he licks my face.

176
02:00:55,480 --> 02:00:57,640
Ok fine, I admit,
maybe I'm a little...

177
02:00:58,000 --> 02:00:59,160
...tad bit attached.

178
02:00:59,240 --> 02:00:59,880
Oh my God!

179
02:01:00,200 --> 02:01:01,080
Your maternal instincts
are awakening.

180
02:01:01,160 --> 02:01:01,920
Shut up!

181
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:02,840
Shhh...

182
02:01:03,680 --> 02:01:04,560
What is that noise?

183
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:07,600
Is that the sound of your
biological clock ticking?

184
02:01:08,120 --> 02:01:08,480
Out.

185
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:10,360
Out of my house!

186
02:01:10,440 --> 02:01:10,920
Right now.
-Yes, it is.

187
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:12,200
Go.
-Yes, it is.

188
02:01:18,120 --> 02:01:19,520
So I was watching this
TV show...

189
02:01:19,640 --> 02:01:21,000
...about women,

190
02:01:21,080 --> 02:01:21,520
you know,

191
02:01:21,640 --> 02:01:23,760
doing crazy things!

192
02:01:24,760 --> 02:01:25,480
TV show?

193
02:01:27,080 --> 02:01:28,760
Ok, I did an online search.

194
02:01:30,080 --> 02:01:31,440
I don't have experience.

195
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:34,520
No worries.
I'll show you.

196
02:02:35,080 --> 02:02:36,720
Mamma, I want princess dress!

197
02:02:36,760 --> 02:02:38,080
I want princess dress!

198
02:02:38,160 --> 02:02:40,080
I want princess dress!
-Arya, no tantrums.

199
02:02:40,160 --> 02:02:42,000
I want princess dress!
-You know better than that.

200
02:02:42,080 --> 02:02:43,520
I want princess dress!

201
02:02:43,640 --> 02:02:45,440
Okay, I'm going.
-I want princess dress!

202
02:02:48,240 --> 02:02:49,120
What are...

203
02:02:49,200 --> 02:02:49,880
leave it.

204
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:51,320
Arya...

205
02:02:53,880 --> 02:02:54,880
Fuck.

206
02:02:55,240 --> 02:02:56,240
Arya, very bad.

207
02:02:57,200 --> 02:02:58,360
Hi Arya!

208
02:02:58,440 --> 02:02:59,760
Hi, Pookie aunty!
-Hi!

209
02:02:59,880 --> 02:03:01,360
What are you guys
doing here?

210
02:03:02,040 --> 02:03:03,520
Nothing, we were just like...

211
02:03:04,120 --> 02:03:04,640
You know just...

212
02:03:04,720 --> 02:03:05,520
Just walking around.

213
02:03:05,880 --> 02:03:08,280
Pookie aunty,
I want princess dress.

214
02:03:08,600 --> 02:03:09,480
Oh!

215
02:03:09,760 --> 02:03:11,320
A princess dress?

216
02:03:11,400 --> 02:03:13,240
She's just driving me mad.

217
02:03:13,320 --> 02:03:14,120
Arya...

218
02:03:15,520 --> 02:03:18,040
Only boring girls
wear princess dresses.

219
02:03:18,120 --> 02:03:19,400
You're not a princess.

220
02:03:19,480 --> 02:03:20,880
You're a warrior.

221
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:22,600
Like Wonder Woman.

222
02:03:22,640 --> 02:03:23,040
Yes?

223
02:03:23,120 --> 02:03:25,600
Mamma, I don't want
princess dress.

224
02:03:25,640 --> 02:03:27,480
I'm Wonder Woman.

225
02:03:28,160 --> 02:03:29,640
Wow! Finally.

226
02:03:31,240 --> 02:03:32,280
Do you want to get
a coffee?

227
02:03:35,200 --> 02:03:36,520
Ya, sure.

228
02:03:36,880 --> 02:03:37,480
Sure!

229
02:03:39,240 --> 02:03:40,680
You're quite good
with kids.

230
02:03:41,240 --> 02:03:42,360
Sister to...

231
02:03:42,440 --> 02:03:43,440
...three siblings.

232
02:03:46,040 --> 02:03:47,200
So you were shopping?

233
02:03:48,160 --> 02:03:49,760
Out buying socks
for Varun.

234
02:03:50,920 --> 02:03:51,560
Wow!

235
02:03:51,880 --> 02:03:54,400
Varun finally shifted
from slippers to shoes?

236
02:03:54,480 --> 02:03:55,200
I wish!

237
02:03:55,960 --> 02:03:57,000
I'm trying.

238
02:03:57,360 --> 02:03:59,560
A little cleanliness,
is that too much to ask for?

239
02:03:59,640 --> 02:04:00,560
Oh my God.

240
02:04:00,640 --> 02:04:01,680
Please don't remind me.

241
02:04:02,400 --> 02:04:04,960
Wash basin used to be filled
with his post shave stubble.

242
02:04:05,040 --> 02:04:06,880
And his clipped toe nails
 in the pot.

243
02:04:07,360 --> 02:04:09,520
Wet towel on the bed,
on the sofa...

244
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:11,280
Sometimes on top
of ironed clothes and...

245
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:14,400
...under the treadmill,
his slippers!

246
02:04:16,480 --> 02:04:18,360
Does he still wear...

247
02:04:18,440 --> 02:04:20,440
...his undies in reverse
the next day?

248
02:04:20,520 --> 02:04:21,960
Oh God! Yes!

249
02:04:23,160 --> 02:04:24,800
Why! Why! Why!
-Ugh!

250
02:04:24,880 --> 02:04:25,440
Fuck!

251
02:04:33,520 --> 02:04:34,520
Hey...

252
02:04:36,800 --> 02:04:39,440
The equation I have
with Arya...

253
02:04:41,200 --> 02:04:42,880
I don't want to be
her mom.

254
02:04:42,960 --> 02:04:44,680
And I can't, even if I tried.

255
02:04:46,560 --> 02:04:47,560
It's just that...

256
02:04:48,200 --> 02:04:50,400
Arya's very important to
Varun and...

257
02:04:51,960 --> 02:04:53,440
I just want to be the
fun aunt.

258
02:04:55,280 --> 02:04:56,200
Sometimes,

259
02:04:56,280 --> 02:04:58,360
I wish I could be
the fun aunt.

260
02:05:00,200 --> 02:05:01,160
Work pressure,

261
02:05:01,240 --> 02:05:03,520
mother's guilt,
household chores...

262
02:05:05,440 --> 02:05:07,440
I wish I had one day...

263
02:05:07,520 --> 02:05:09,000
...to just be me.

264
02:05:09,680 --> 02:05:10,880
And not Arya's mamma.

265
02:05:12,240 --> 02:05:14,160
I mean is it too much
to ask for?

266
02:05:14,240 --> 02:05:16,160
Like just...
 one fucking day!

267
02:05:18,400 --> 02:05:19,400
I know what you're saying.

268
02:05:20,040 --> 02:05:21,000
In all the roles we play,

269
02:05:21,080 --> 02:05:22,960
whilst living for
everyone else,

270
02:05:23,040 --> 02:05:24,520
we forget to live a little
for ourselves.

271
02:05:25,400 --> 02:05:27,000
Maybe it's time we
reclaim that!

272
02:05:29,040 --> 02:05:31,040
We all need to learn
how to please ourselves.

273
02:05:35,160 --> 02:05:36,160
Did you just say that?

274
02:05:37,400 --> 02:05:37,960
Ya!

275
02:05:44,680 --> 02:05:45,520
I've done it.

276
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:47,360
I've bought myself
a vibrator.

277
02:05:47,440 --> 02:05:48,200
How'd you do it?

278
02:05:48,280 --> 02:05:50,160
Like did you have to
stick it in like a fire stick?

279
02:05:51,080 --> 02:05:52,440
Dude! Clit play!

280
02:05:52,520 --> 02:05:54,200
I'm going to make you
google vagina.

281
02:05:54,280 --> 02:05:56,560
Seriously.
I know what a clit is!

282
02:05:56,640 --> 02:05:59,080
Mostly Ms. VeeVee
won't need it.

283
02:05:59,160 --> 02:06:00,760
My meet and greet is
about to begin.

284
02:06:00,840 --> 02:06:01,840
Dude!
Oh my goodness!

285
02:06:01,920 --> 02:06:03,520
You're the only person
who'd call an online date...

286
02:06:03,600 --> 02:06:04,800
...a meet and greet!

287
02:06:04,880 --> 02:06:05,360
Seriously!

288
02:06:05,440 --> 02:06:06,680
But it is right?

289
02:06:07,040 --> 02:06:09,160
Hey, hi!
How do you do?

290
02:06:09,240 --> 02:06:09,920
Doggy style?

291
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:10,800
Missionary?

292
02:06:11,680 --> 02:06:12,400
Anal?

293
02:06:13,240 --> 02:06:14,960
Okay, so what role
are you going to play?

294
02:06:15,040 --> 02:06:16,560
Is it going to be like
lost babe in the woods?

295
02:06:16,640 --> 02:06:17,120
Or is it going to be like...

296
02:06:17,200 --> 02:06:18,520
Come here! Let me teach
you a thing or two!

297
02:06:18,600 --> 02:06:19,720
Hey! MPDG!

298
02:06:20,280 --> 02:06:21,480
What is MPDG?

299
02:06:21,560 --> 02:06:22,520
Sounds like a disease.

300
02:06:22,600 --> 02:06:23,960
It kind of is.

301
02:06:24,040 --> 02:06:25,560
Manic Pixie Dream Girl.

302
02:06:25,640 --> 02:06:28,200
This bohemian dream
girl who writes poetry.

303
02:06:28,280 --> 02:06:29,920
Can drink any guy
under the table.

304
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:31,280
And...who pees in
the streets.

305
02:06:31,360 --> 02:06:33,560
Ya. She talks to
the clouds.

306
02:06:33,640 --> 02:06:35,440
And whose IQ is like
that of a five-year old.

307
02:06:36,520 --> 02:06:37,760
The one who dances
in the rain.

308
02:06:37,840 --> 02:06:38,280
Wow!

309
02:06:38,360 --> 02:06:39,400
Not for cardio.

310
02:06:39,480 --> 02:06:41,160
Just because she's
free spirited!

311
02:06:41,520 --> 02:06:43,480
They're like horny unicorns!

312
02:06:43,560 --> 02:06:45,080
They have carefree sex and...

313
02:06:45,160 --> 02:06:46,520
...then just like that,
they disappear.

314
02:06:46,600 --> 02:06:48,480
Because commitment
is a myth.

315
02:06:48,880 --> 02:06:51,400
Basically, every guy's
fantasy come true.

316
02:06:51,480 --> 02:06:52,720
That's my fantasy as well.

317
02:06:53,080 --> 02:06:54,080
Mangs,

318
02:06:54,160 --> 02:06:55,320
they exist just so that
they can...

319
02:06:55,400 --> 02:06:57,720
...save the hero from his
disgusting, boring life.

320
02:06:58,160 --> 02:06:59,560
You are the antithesis
of that.

321
02:06:59,640 --> 02:07:01,000
You live only for yourself, ok?

322
02:07:01,080 --> 02:07:02,760
By the way, where can I
find these strange creatures?

323
02:07:02,840 --> 02:07:03,720
Like in the zoo?

324
02:07:04,360 --> 02:07:06,480
In books, films...shows.

325
02:07:06,960 --> 02:07:07,680
Written by men.

326
02:07:07,760 --> 02:07:08,640
Made by men.

327
02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:09,920
For men.

328
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:10,560
Wow.

329
02:07:10,640 --> 02:07:11,640
I can understand this...

330
02:07:11,720 --> 02:07:13,560
...drinking-them-under-the-table
business, right?

331
02:07:13,880 --> 02:07:15,360
But peeing in the streets?

332
02:07:15,440 --> 02:07:17,400
I mean, c'mon!
I do Kegels.

333
02:07:17,480 --> 02:07:18,480
Wait, wait, wait, wait...
Wow!

334
02:07:18,560 --> 02:07:19,360
What is Kegels now?

335
02:07:19,440 --> 02:07:20,600
Okay wait.
Who is Kegels?

336
02:07:20,680 --> 02:07:21,960
Not who, what.

337
02:07:22,040 --> 02:07:24,640
So basically, it's a pelvic flow
muscular exercise.

338
02:07:24,720 --> 02:07:27,240
On the count of three,
clench and then release alright?

339
02:07:27,320 --> 02:07:28,440
One, two, three...

340
02:07:28,520 --> 02:07:29,280
Clench!

341
02:07:29,800 --> 02:07:30,720
And then release.

342
02:07:31,800 --> 02:07:33,160
One more time, clench!

343
02:07:34,040 --> 02:07:34,760
And then release.

344
02:07:35,120 --> 02:07:35,920
Oh shit!
-Yes!

345
02:07:36,320 --> 02:07:38,280
I think I just peed a little.
What!

346
02:07:38,360 --> 02:07:40,600
Listen, you got your
peeing-on-the-streets fantasy!

347
02:07:40,680 --> 02:07:42,360
Fuck! Finally!

348
02:07:42,880 --> 02:07:43,880
Where should we head?

349
02:07:43,960 --> 02:07:44,760
She has to pee!

350
02:07:44,840 --> 02:07:45,800
I'm ok, I think.

351
02:07:45,880 --> 02:07:46,880
I'm so hungry.
Let's go eat.

352
02:07:46,960 --> 02:07:48,400
We have to find her
a loo!

353
02:07:58,640 --> 02:07:59,480
Oh my God.

354
02:07:59,560 --> 02:08:01,880
Did you read about
Karan and Shaina's love child?

355
02:08:02,440 --> 02:08:04,920
Seriously, what the fuck!
I was so shocked!

356
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,640
This Investigator.com app
is so cool. See...

357
02:08:08,320 --> 02:08:08,880
Show.

358
02:08:09,800 --> 02:08:10,400
Check it out.

359
02:08:10,840 --> 02:08:11,680
Amazing!

360
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:14,360
Where do they get
this stuff?

361
02:08:14,440 --> 02:08:15,080
I know!

362
02:08:15,720 --> 02:08:16,520
Damn cool!

363
02:08:16,600 --> 02:08:17,360
I know!

364
02:08:18,440 --> 02:08:19,080
Excuse me.

365
02:08:19,640 --> 02:08:20,040
Ya?

366
02:08:21,200 --> 02:08:23,360
Reading about people's affairs
and love children is not fun.

367
02:08:23,440 --> 02:08:24,520
It's ridiculous.

368
02:08:24,920 --> 02:08:25,720
I'm sorry?

369
02:08:25,800 --> 02:08:27,880
You should be,
for reading crap like this.

370
02:08:28,400 --> 02:08:29,600
Don't you read real news?

371
02:08:29,920 --> 02:08:30,760
This is news.

372
02:08:31,440 --> 02:08:31,960
Ya...

373
02:08:33,640 --> 02:08:35,360
Investigator.com
used to be one of the...

374
02:08:35,440 --> 02:08:37,400
...most trustworthy news
sites for the last three years.

375
02:08:37,480 --> 02:08:39,120
And because of low IQ
dumbos like you,

376
02:08:39,200 --> 02:08:41,880
we have to now publish
cheap gossip.

377
02:08:43,240 --> 02:08:44,400
You should be ashamed
of yourself.

378
02:08:44,920 --> 02:08:45,480
You know what?

379
02:08:45,560 --> 02:08:47,960
Why don't you stop thinking
about who's fucking whom...

380
02:08:48,040 --> 02:08:49,560
...and actually start
thinking about...

381
02:08:49,640 --> 02:08:51,000
...how you think you're
fucking the system...

382
02:08:51,080 --> 02:08:53,080
...but actually, it's the system
that's fucking you!

383
02:08:53,960 --> 02:08:54,680
Idiots!

384
02:08:55,040 --> 02:08:55,840
Hashtag weirdo!

385
02:08:58,920 --> 02:08:59,480
Hey!

386
02:08:59,840 --> 02:09:00,400
Oh hi...

387
02:09:00,720 --> 02:09:01,360
How are you?

388
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:02,080
Good.

389
02:09:03,360 --> 02:09:04,040
You...

390
02:09:04,120 --> 02:09:04,920
Are you okay?

391
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:05,720
Ya...

392
02:09:05,800 --> 02:09:06,920
You're crying...

393
02:09:07,560 --> 02:09:09,960
I'm so sorry...
I'm so sorry.

394
02:09:10,040 --> 02:09:10,720
What happened?

395
02:09:12,320 --> 02:09:13,000
I'm so sorry.

396
02:09:13,080 --> 02:09:13,400
Oh my God.

397
02:09:13,480 --> 02:09:14,240
This is so embarrassing.
-What's wrong?

398
02:09:14,320 --> 02:09:15,360
I'm so sorry.

399
02:09:15,440 --> 02:09:16,800
Is everything okay?
-Ya, ya...

400
02:09:18,640 --> 02:09:19,200
I'm so sorry.

401
02:09:19,280 --> 02:09:21,520
This doesn't happen to me.
-It's okay. It's alright.

402
02:09:21,600 --> 02:09:22,400
It's alright.

403
02:09:22,480 --> 02:09:23,520
Should I take you home?

404
02:09:24,360 --> 02:09:25,320
I'll take you home.

405
02:09:37,200 --> 02:09:38,080
Feeling better?

406
02:09:38,520 --> 02:09:39,160
Ya...

407
02:09:40,720 --> 02:09:41,920
Are you sure you're okay?

408
02:09:54,440 --> 02:09:55,440
Damini...

409
02:09:56,560 --> 02:09:57,640
You're my patient.

410
02:10:00,080 --> 02:10:01,080
Not right now.

411
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,240
A woman has eight
erogenous zones.

412
02:10:41,280 --> 02:10:42,200
The ear.

413
02:10:44,880 --> 02:10:45,640
The neck.

414
02:10:49,800 --> 02:10:50,920
The breasts.

415
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:51,800
Ouch!

416
02:10:53,400 --> 02:10:54,440
Sorry you okay?

417
02:10:54,520 --> 02:10:55,760
Ya ya...that's fine...go on.

418
02:10:58,440 --> 02:10:59,080
Wait!

419
02:10:59,200 --> 02:10:59,960
Those were...

420
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:02,040
...expensive.

421
02:11:03,160 --> 02:11:04,440
The vagina.

422
02:11:08,520 --> 02:11:10,240
The cervix.

423
02:11:11,400 --> 02:11:12,520
And finally...

424
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:15,760
The piece de resistance...

425
02:11:16,520 --> 02:11:17,160
What's that?

426
02:11:17,720 --> 02:11:19,080
Getting to your...

427
02:11:19,560 --> 02:11:20,800
G-spot.

428
02:11:21,560 --> 02:11:22,080
Okay...

429
02:11:23,320 --> 02:11:24,080
Here?

430
02:11:24,640 --> 02:11:25,480
No...

431
02:11:25,560 --> 02:11:26,280
Here?

432
02:11:26,320 --> 02:11:28,320
Uh...not there either...

433
02:11:29,800 --> 02:11:30,520
Here.

434
02:11:42,680 --> 02:11:45,200
And they say the G-spot
is a myth.

435
02:11:51,520 --> 02:11:52,320
We are done?

436
02:11:54,280 --> 02:11:55,960
Well, today was about you.

437
02:11:57,080 --> 02:11:57,960
Next time...

438
02:11:58,040 --> 02:11:59,640
...will be about both of us.

439
02:12:01,040 --> 02:12:01,880
Oh!

440
02:12:03,400 --> 02:12:04,080
Okay.

441
02:12:10,760 --> 02:12:12,680
Hi baby!

442
02:12:14,960 --> 02:12:16,000
Check out the new books.

443
02:12:18,560 --> 02:12:19,400
Hmm...

444
02:12:19,800 --> 02:12:22,240
So you and Kavya are
bonding now?

445
02:12:25,640 --> 02:12:26,560
I knew it.

446
02:12:28,400 --> 02:12:29,560
She told you?

447
02:12:31,400 --> 02:12:34,160
It's just a fucking vibrator.

448
02:12:35,440 --> 02:12:36,040
I'm sorry, what?

449
02:12:36,320 --> 02:12:38,400
Mom has a rocket
in her bag.

450
02:12:41,880 --> 02:12:42,880
Wow!

451
02:12:43,320 --> 02:12:45,880
From no sex to sex on tap?

452
02:12:47,440 --> 02:12:48,280
Anj,

453
02:12:48,760 --> 02:12:50,440
you're beginning to
worry me now.

454
02:12:51,760 --> 02:12:52,560
Awww...

455
02:12:53,520 --> 02:12:55,320
Don't be worried sweetheart.

456
02:12:55,440 --> 02:12:58,000
I'm just an overworked,
single mom...

457
02:12:58,080 --> 02:12:59,440
...whose ex-husband...

458
02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:01,640
...doesn't contribute a
single penny.

459
02:13:01,720 --> 02:13:04,000
Who thinks he's twenty
years old...

460
02:13:04,080 --> 02:13:06,520
...and changes his girlfriend
every six months.

461
02:13:06,560 --> 02:13:08,080
So I'm really sorry...

462
02:13:08,160 --> 02:13:10,240
...if I decided to relieve
myself of...

463
02:13:10,320 --> 02:13:11,960
...some of the stress.

464
02:13:13,640 --> 02:13:14,680
Bye Arya!

465
02:13:14,760 --> 02:13:15,320
Bye.

466
02:13:19,040 --> 02:13:20,800
It's a date not a
meet and greet.

467
02:13:20,880 --> 02:13:22,240
Ya, I'm meeting him
at the bar.

468
02:13:22,680 --> 02:13:24,160
Dinner is too much
commitment.

469
02:13:24,680 --> 02:13:26,080
If I don't like him,
I'll just say bye to him.

470
02:13:26,800 --> 02:13:27,800
Besides I'm meeting a...

471
02:13:27,920 --> 02:13:30,040
...meeting a new intern
for a job interview later.

472
02:13:30,080 --> 02:13:30,800
Ya.

473
02:13:33,720 --> 02:13:34,200
Hi!

474
02:13:35,080 --> 02:13:36,320
Ok, I gotta go. Bye.

475
02:13:41,200 --> 02:13:41,760
Hi!

476
02:13:42,160 --> 02:13:42,640
Hi.

477
02:13:43,240 --> 02:13:45,440
I hope I didn't make
you wait too long...

478
02:13:45,520 --> 02:13:46,320
No, not at all.

479
02:13:46,920 --> 02:13:47,560
Okay.

480
02:13:48,920 --> 02:13:49,240
Ya.

481
02:13:54,800 --> 02:13:55,920
You're very good looking.

482
02:13:56,800 --> 02:13:58,480
Your photo does you
no justice.

483
02:13:59,560 --> 02:14:02,400
You look a lot younger
than your picture as well.

484
02:14:02,480 --> 02:14:03,320
Well,

485
02:14:03,400 --> 02:14:04,960
sue me for being hot.

486
02:14:05,960 --> 02:14:09,040
So, is it your first time or...

487
02:14:09,080 --> 02:14:10,240
...you're like a pro?

488
02:14:11,400 --> 02:14:13,680
Actually, this is my
fourth meeting.

489
02:14:14,280 --> 02:14:15,280
Window shopping?

490
02:14:16,280 --> 02:14:19,080
No, I've actually just given a few...
It's alright.

491
02:14:19,160 --> 02:14:20,760
I'm window shopping too.

492
02:14:21,240 --> 02:14:23,760
I think we all deserve the best.

493
02:14:24,080 --> 02:14:24,720
Of course.

494
02:14:25,040 --> 02:14:26,520
Do you want to play
a little game?

495
02:14:27,760 --> 02:14:28,240
Sure.

496
02:14:28,800 --> 02:14:31,120
Boxers or briefs?

497
02:14:33,880 --> 02:14:34,680
Legal briefs.

498
02:14:37,360 --> 02:14:38,400
Nice...

499
02:14:38,480 --> 02:14:40,040
Lawyer joke, nice!

500
02:14:41,560 --> 02:14:42,240
Your turn.

501
02:14:43,120 --> 02:14:44,280
My turn, right.

502
02:14:44,720 --> 02:14:46,000
Civil or criminal?

503
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:48,680
Civil when you're nice...

504
02:14:49,280 --> 02:14:50,520
and criminal...

505
02:14:50,600 --> 02:14:51,600
...when you're dirty.

506
02:14:53,080 --> 02:14:55,400
For fear of contempt of court.

507
02:15:00,760 --> 02:15:02,440
Oh shit.

508
02:15:03,840 --> 02:15:04,600
Shit, he's early.

509
02:15:09,640 --> 02:15:11,560
Can you just give me
five minutes?

510
02:15:12,560 --> 02:15:13,520
Ya.
-Ya?

511
02:15:13,600 --> 02:15:14,440
And...

512
02:15:14,520 --> 02:15:16,640
...order me a Chianti,
will you?

513
02:15:17,840 --> 02:15:19,120
Ah...sure.

514
02:15:19,520 --> 02:15:20,680
Don't be so nervous.

515
02:15:20,760 --> 02:15:21,480
Just...

516
02:15:21,800 --> 02:15:23,640
...imagine me without clothes.

517
02:15:24,120 --> 02:15:24,880
You'll be fine.

518
02:15:30,640 --> 02:15:31,320
Hi.

519
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:33,360
Hi.
-I'm Anjana Menon.

520
02:15:33,440 --> 02:15:34,320
Nice to meet you.

521
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:35,320
Please sit.

522
02:15:35,840 --> 02:15:37,200
There is no need
for formality.

523
02:15:37,680 --> 02:15:39,600
Actually it's my first time so...

524
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:41,880
Ah! Don't worry.
I'll teach you everything...

525
02:15:41,960 --> 02:15:43,720
...as long as you are
willing to learn.

526
02:15:43,800 --> 02:15:45,640
Ya, I'm more than willing.

527
02:15:46,360 --> 02:15:47,920
Super. Let's get started.

528
02:15:48,680 --> 02:15:49,200
Now?

529
02:15:50,320 --> 02:15:51,000
Ya.

530
02:15:51,760 --> 02:15:52,960
Okay, so...

531
02:15:53,040 --> 02:15:54,880
...should we go to a hotel or...

532
02:15:55,360 --> 02:15:57,240
Why a hotel?
Why not here?

533
02:15:57,320 --> 02:15:57,960
Here?

534
02:15:58,480 --> 02:15:59,560
You mean like...

535
02:16:00,400 --> 02:16:01,280
...in the washroom?

536
02:16:02,400 --> 02:16:03,040
Oh!

537
02:16:03,120 --> 02:16:03,840
You need to go?

538
02:16:04,320 --> 02:16:04,840
No.

539
02:16:06,920 --> 02:16:07,880
Sorry I...

540
02:16:07,960 --> 02:16:09,000
I'm a little confused.

541
02:16:09,080 --> 02:16:10,080
Okay...

542
02:16:10,160 --> 02:16:11,200
You know what?

543
02:16:11,280 --> 02:16:12,000
Let's start afresh.

544
02:16:12,080 --> 02:16:12,520
Ya.
-Ya?

545
02:16:12,600 --> 02:16:15,320
Let's do that.
-So tell me about your strengths.

546
02:16:16,720 --> 02:16:17,160
Okay.

547
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,760
So, I'm extremely fun loving.

548
02:16:21,320 --> 02:16:22,120
Easy going.

549
02:16:22,200 --> 02:16:23,320
I'm a great listener.

550
02:16:23,400 --> 02:16:24,440
Right.
-Very caring.

551
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:25,840
And I...

552
02:16:25,920 --> 02:16:27,400
...give the best
foot massages.

553
02:16:29,840 --> 02:16:30,640
Okay!

554
02:16:31,360 --> 02:16:32,480
And your weaknesses?

555
02:16:32,800 --> 02:16:33,960
I don't have any.

556
02:16:38,360 --> 02:16:40,520
I can go five times
in one night.

557
02:16:55,880 --> 02:16:57,280
Let's start again.

558
02:16:58,760 --> 02:17:00,560
Hi, I'm Anjana Menon,

559
02:17:00,640 --> 02:17:03,800
Senior Associate at
Lalwani and Jhunjhunwalas.

560
02:17:04,280 --> 02:17:05,480
Arjun...Nair.

561
02:17:06,320 --> 02:17:07,880
It is an absolute pleasure
to meet you.

562
02:17:07,960 --> 02:17:08,760
I'm a huge fan.

563
02:17:08,840 --> 02:17:11,280
I have read all your
articles in Lawyers Today.

564
02:17:12,200 --> 02:17:14,000
And I have also studied
your cases in NLS.

565
02:17:14,720 --> 02:17:15,360
Thanks.

566
02:17:25,800 --> 02:17:27,080
So did you hire the intern?

567
02:17:27,520 --> 02:17:28,280
Obviously.

568
02:17:28,800 --> 02:17:30,920
Else, he would've sued
me for sexual harassment.

569
02:17:44,160 --> 02:17:45,000
See you Jeh...

570
02:17:45,920 --> 02:17:46,920
Hey, no last order?

571
02:17:47,320 --> 02:17:48,720
Nah, I'm done.

572
02:17:48,800 --> 02:17:49,360
Hey listen,

573
02:17:49,440 --> 02:17:50,840
I'm really sorry
I crossed the line.

574
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:52,440
When?

575
02:17:53,320 --> 02:17:54,400
You know when
I said all that...

576
02:17:54,480 --> 02:17:56,040
...biological clock nonsense.

577
02:17:59,880 --> 02:18:00,920
Can I give you one advice?

578
02:18:01,280 --> 02:18:01,960
Yes, tell me...

579
02:18:02,760 --> 02:18:04,840
Please, never be a
stand-up comedian.

580
02:18:08,640 --> 02:18:10,400
Bad jokes are in my genes.

581
02:18:11,040 --> 02:18:12,760
If you ever come
to Goa to meet Xerxes...

582
02:18:12,840 --> 02:18:15,240
...you'll see how crazy
my Parsi family is.

583
02:18:15,560 --> 02:18:16,480
And how unfunny.

584
02:18:18,560 --> 02:18:19,560
Seriously though, anytime.

585
02:18:20,880 --> 02:18:23,160
I also make a mean fish curry.

586
02:18:25,120 --> 02:18:26,040
Sold.

587
02:18:29,320 --> 02:18:30,600
You always leave too soon.

588
02:18:34,120 --> 02:18:36,000
I thought I always overstayed.

589
02:18:36,400 --> 02:18:37,320
No, never.

590
02:18:37,960 --> 02:18:38,600
Hey, hang on.

591
02:18:44,240 --> 02:18:45,280
Irish single malt.

592
02:18:46,360 --> 02:18:46,960
The best.

593
02:18:48,520 --> 02:18:49,240
Stay?

594
02:19:17,440 --> 02:19:18,120
Mamma!

595
02:19:18,560 --> 02:19:20,000
God you scared me!

596
02:19:21,920 --> 02:19:23,520
Look at the state you're in.

597
02:19:26,640 --> 02:19:27,840
Are you drunk?

598
02:19:30,880 --> 02:19:32,760
From tomorrow, you will
stop hanging out...

599
02:19:32,840 --> 02:19:34,080
...with those loose girls.

600
02:19:35,040 --> 02:19:35,760
Loose?

601
02:19:36,360 --> 02:19:38,480
Mama, Umang works out
everyday.

602
02:19:38,560 --> 02:19:40,640
She's so tight, you know...

603
02:19:40,720 --> 02:19:43,720
It's no wonder even
Pavan rejected you.

604
02:19:43,800 --> 02:19:44,880
Good riddance.

605
02:19:44,960 --> 02:19:46,520
He wanted to suck
my toes.

606
02:19:47,200 --> 02:19:47,680
So?

607
02:19:48,360 --> 02:19:50,720
Some guys like toes
and some guys like breasts.

608
02:19:51,600 --> 02:19:53,960
But if you keep rejecting
boys like this,

609
02:19:54,040 --> 02:19:55,600
you'll be alone forever.

610
02:19:56,200 --> 02:19:57,520
And if you don't get married,

611
02:19:57,880 --> 02:19:59,800
what do you have Siddhi?

612
02:20:02,960 --> 02:20:04,120
Do you even love me?

613
02:20:05,440 --> 02:20:06,560
Excuse me?

614
02:20:08,280 --> 02:20:11,240
You tore me up coming out
of me Siddhi!

615
02:20:11,320 --> 02:20:13,080
Then why did you give
birth to me?

616
02:20:13,400 --> 02:20:14,760
You should've had
an abortion!

617
02:20:15,280 --> 02:20:17,080
Or you should've just handed
me over to Julie Didi!

618
02:20:17,160 --> 02:20:18,480
Atleast she loved me!

619
02:20:18,560 --> 02:20:19,800
All our problems would
be solved!

620
02:20:19,880 --> 02:20:20,960
All our problems!

621
02:20:21,400 --> 02:20:22,320
Julie?

622
02:20:22,400 --> 02:20:24,000
The one who kept feeding
you cupcakes as a kid...

623
02:20:24,080 --> 02:20:25,840
...and gave you so
many problems?

624
02:20:26,880 --> 02:20:28,600
And you think she cared
for you more than I do?

625
02:20:28,680 --> 02:20:30,080
Yes, she did.

626
02:20:31,200 --> 02:20:33,360
I loved her more than
I will ever love you.

627
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:34,920
Infact I just...

628
02:20:35,360 --> 02:20:36,560
...hate you!

629
02:20:38,600 --> 02:20:41,640
Yes yes...you can hate
me all you like Siddhi!

630
02:20:41,720 --> 02:20:44,120
But that won't get
you a nice boy to marry!

631
02:20:44,760 --> 02:20:46,120
One meeting with that
Mohit boy...

632
02:20:46,200 --> 02:20:48,040
...and he turned gay!

633
02:20:48,120 --> 02:20:49,640
He chose men over you!

634
02:20:49,720 --> 02:20:51,840
Shut up!
Just shut up Sneha!

635
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:54,720
You know what?

636
02:20:54,800 --> 02:20:55,680
Maybe...just maybe...

637
02:20:55,760 --> 02:20:57,520
...you should try eating
once in a while!

638
02:20:57,600 --> 02:20:59,320
It might make you a
 nicer person!

639
02:21:03,640 --> 02:21:05,480
Julie Didi! Cheese toast!

640
02:21:06,120 --> 02:21:07,480
Siddhi baby, salad.

641
02:21:08,640 --> 02:21:09,360
Siddhi!

642
02:21:09,840 --> 02:21:11,600
This is our new maid,
Lekha Didi.

643
02:21:12,440 --> 02:21:13,880
Where's Julie Didi?

644
02:21:14,320 --> 02:21:15,800
I had to fire her baby.

645
02:21:17,080 --> 02:21:19,600
That witch had turned this
place into a cupcake factory.

646
02:21:20,800 --> 02:21:22,160
C'mon, eat your salad.
