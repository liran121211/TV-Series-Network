1
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,920
We get stuck in the past.

2
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:13,200
Just because it's familiar.

3
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:14,920
We are so scared of
the future...

4
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:17,360
...that we prefer to live
in the past.

5
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:25,040
This is the way we
touch ourselves,

6
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:27,360
touch ourselves...
touch ourselves...

7
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:29,320
This is the way we
touch ourselves...

8
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:32,040
on a cold n' frosty
morning.

9
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:34,040
This is the way we
rub our clit,

10
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:36,400
rub our clit...

11
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:38,320
This is the way we
rub our clit...

12
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:39,600
on a cold...
-Grandma!

13
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:45,040
Now tell me, how is Varun?

14
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:46,320
He must be fine.

15
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:48,240
And I’m fine as well.

16
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:49,440
Thanks for asking.

17
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:53,080
We chat with each
other everyday.

18
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:54,520
Thank you Radha.

19
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:55,440
Come sweetheart...

20
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:56,720
...go and play there.

21
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:58,520
I'm so glad...

22
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:01,160
...that I brought
my tea leaves with me.

23
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:04,160
If you don't steep the leaves,

24
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:05,480
then you haven't tasted
real tea.

25
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,720
And your tea bags,

26
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:09,880
you know what's in them,
don't you?

27
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:10,560
Tea dust.

28
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:12,280
You've been telling me
this since I was a kid.

29
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:15,640
The first flush is really nice.

30
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:17,520
But the second flush,

31
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:18,840
that is the best!

32
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:21,760
By the way, you're beginning
to sound just like dad.

33
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:24,080
I've come here to
take a break...

34
01:26:24,160 --> 01:26:25,640
...from your father
for a few days.

35
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:27,360
Really?

36
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:28,800
All okay?

37
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:31,160
Ever since he retired,

38
01:26:31,240 --> 01:26:32,560
he's become a nuisance.

39
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:36,520
Now I'm his cook, valet, bearer,
gardener, everything.

40
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:38,480
Really, I need this holiday Anju.

41
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:40,600
And how long is this
holiday planned for?

42
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:44,800
It's my granddaughter's
fourth birthday.

43
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:45,760
How could I not be here!

44
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:49,240
Arya, I remember the day
you were born.

45
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:50,800
And Mama, do you?

46
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:51,400
Mama?

47
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:52,920
Mama was on Epidural.

48
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:54,360
She doesn't remember
a thing.

49
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:56,920
Why don't you also tell her that
mama didn't cry but her father did?

50
01:26:58,040 --> 01:27:00,920
Such a sensitive, creative man.
-Ya...

51
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,400
Pooky aunty is very nice.

52
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:04,520
Pooky aunty?

53
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,120
Who is Pooky aunty?

54
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:08,640
Is she real or imaginary?

55
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:09,440
Real.

56
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:11,320
Papa's special friend.

57
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:17,160
Anju, really, this is your fault.

58
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:18,360
I agree.

59
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,440
Especially the way she
was conceived.

60
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:42,120
Yuck!

61
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:45,160
Smells like some cheap
bar in here.

62
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:48,160
Whose idea was it...

63
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:50,160
...to take me drinking
during happy hour!

64
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:53,720
Shut up!

65
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:54,840
It's not that bad!

66
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:58,120
Fuck.

67
01:27:58,520 --> 01:27:59,200
Shit.

68
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:03,680
I think the condom broke.

69
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:07,480
Don't worry.

70
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:10,640
My periods got over
this morning.

71
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:14,280
Thank you universe.

72
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:20,000
Again...again...again

73
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:23,520
God!

74
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:25,560
How did we end up here!

75
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:27,480
I'm fucked!

76
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:29,640
Technically...

77
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:31,440
...that's how we ended
up here.

78
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:34,200
I told you not to use
those Thailand condoms.

79
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:36,440
You only told me to
buy it because...

80
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:38,600
...it has this dragon fruit
flavour on it.

81
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:40,800
I said 'Look it has
a vibrating ring...'

82
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:41,920
And the next thing
I know,

83
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,120
you bought it!

84
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:45,800
I don't even know if
I like them.

85
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:46,520
Condoms?

86
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:47,800
Babies.

87
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:50,440
Baby, most people don't
like babies.

88
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:52,120
Until they have their own.

89
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:55,080
Baby, most people like babies
till they have their own!

90
01:28:58,080 --> 01:28:59,280
What if I'm not maternal?

91
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:01,800
C'mon now...

92
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:04,920
You are very maternal.

93
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:05,600
Very.

94
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:06,800
No seriously.

95
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:09,840
You take care of a
big baby like me right?

96
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:13,640
Everything will change.

97
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:15,440
Ya...

98
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:18,760
You'll have to quit drinking
wine for a year and a half.

99
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:25,440
What about my career?

100
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:29,640
I'm working so hard to become
a Senior Associate.

101
01:29:29,720 --> 01:29:30,920
We'll share the load okay?

102
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:32,600
We'll get a maid.

103
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:36,160
I'll be at home
most of the time.

104
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:38,240
And that way I can
work on my script also.

105
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:41,360
Mama will go through
the roof in rage.

106
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:42,040
Ya!

107
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:43,640
Shit.

108
01:29:43,720 --> 01:29:45,240
And your father is
going to kill you.

109
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:47,360
Okay, just see and tell me.

110
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:50,200
Okay, but before that,
will you marry me?

111
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:52,040
What?

112
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:53,720
Ms. Anjana Menon,

113
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:56,360
I want to have cheap beer,

114
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:58,440
cheap sex,

115
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:01,200
using cheap condoms
with you...

116
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:03,120
...for the rest of my life.

117
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:04,800
Marry me please...

118
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:07,720
You're mad.
I'm going to see it.

119
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:11,120
Fuck! I'm pregnant!

120
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:13,360
Oh shit!

121
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:14,920
We are pregnant!

122
01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:19,200
What are you doing!

123
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:21,360
Okay listen...

124
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:24,240
...I won't change my name
after marriage.

125
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:27,920
Don't change anything
about yourself, my love.

126
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:41,400
Hello there...

127
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:44,880
I'm just showing off
in my sexy bikini...

128
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:47,720
...for all my friends out there.

129
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:49,320
Would you like to join me
on my couch?

130
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:50,960
Come baby...

131
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,320
Hello,
I'm your sexy maid.

132
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:58,200
Is that some dirt?

133
01:31:58,280 --> 01:32:01,000
I'm going to clean you up
real good.

134
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:03,400
This Mohit is mad.

135
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:05,080
Wait till it's perfectly cooked.

136
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:07,160
Add a pinch of rosemary.

137
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:19,920
Siddhi!

138
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:21,040
Oh shit!

139
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:43,680
Mohit Bhatwal.

140
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:44,600
The hotelier?

141
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:46,920
He's in Massani Hospital
right now.

142
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,120
Is he dying?

143
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:48,960
Even better.

144
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:50,360
He's in rehab.

145
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:52,160
Sarika Shaikh?

146
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:55,520
She's gone to LA for
a film-making course right?

147
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:56,080
Wrong.

148
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:59,240
My friend, who's a doctor
at Sinai, told me...

149
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:01,440
...that she's trying to
buy out all of Silicon Valley.

150
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:02,640
Get it?

151
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:03,400
Akanksha.

152
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:04,280
Huh?

153
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:06,360
My team here is crime and
political reporters.

154
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:08,160
They don't do this sh...
-This 'sh**'...

155
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:10,480
...is what's going to put
money in their salary accounts.

156
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:12,000
A sting is a sting.

157
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:13,560
And a source is a source.

158
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:14,480
So get on with it.

159
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:15,760
Kyra Kapoor.

160
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:17,320
Is she pregnant or not?

161
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:19,480
I want exclusive pictures...

162
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:20,920
...that proves that
she's preggers.

163
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,080
Follow her, stalk her,
do whatever.

164
01:33:23,160 --> 01:33:24,120
Who will do it?

165
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:27,440
Great!

166
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:28,080
Go!

167
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,480
Keep that tempo up.

168
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:34,640
Yes, good job.

169
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:35,360
Back straight.

170
01:33:37,160 --> 01:33:38,640
Yes. C'mon,
let's go, let's go.

171
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:39,480
C’mon, c’mon.

172
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:39,960
Let's go.

173
01:33:40,040 --> 01:33:40,880
Thirty-seven.

174
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:42,000
Good job, keep your
back straight.

175
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:44,040
I wanna see that sweat!
Give it everything.

176
01:33:44,120 --> 01:33:45,440
Give it everything!
C'mon!

177
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:46,360
You’ve got to do work!

178
01:33:46,440 --> 01:33:47,040
Push!

179
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:52,120
Shit. Shit. Shit!

180
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:54,280
It's okay, that was quite
an intense session.

181
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:57,120
No. It's not okay.

182
01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:01,000
If this keeps up, injury
and pack up on the third day itself.

183
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:04,360
I mean, you don't understand,
this is my last chance.

184
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:07,080
But it's just crunches, Samara.
It's okay.

185
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:09,760
Look, everything matters.
Even a crunch.

186
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:12,880
What? What's so funny?

187
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:14,840
Sorry, I'm having a
fangirl moment.

188
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:16,760
Because my idol
Samara Kapoor...

189
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:18,760
...is sitting here and getting
upset over crunches.

190
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:21,400
As a trainer, this is the best
moment of my life.

191
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:22,840
So go on, keep laughing.

192
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:25,080
Okay, let's try another
technique.

193
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:26,760
The T.U.L. style.

194
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:28,440
T.U.L.?

195
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:30,640
The Umang Ludhiyanvi style.

196
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:33,520
Okay.
-Ya?

197
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:34,000
Okay!

198
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:36,040
Futhermucker!
Mothersmucker!

199
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:38,040
Futhermucker!
Mothersmucker!

200
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:39,240
Dickhead!

201
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:40,520
Dickhead!

202
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:42,320
Suck my balls!

203
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:43,480
Suck my balls!

204
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:45,640
Grandmama's vagina!

205
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:47,040
Grandmama's vagina!

206
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:48,200
Fuck my ass!

207
01:34:48,280 --> 01:34:49,640
Fuck my ass!

208
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:51,640
Now that's more like it!

209
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:55,960
That was awesome.

210
01:34:56,040 --> 01:34:57,400
You are amazing.

211
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:58,880
Whoo!

212
01:35:02,640 --> 01:35:03,520
Seventy-two...

213
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,080
Sixty-eight...

214
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:06,280
Sixty-four...

215
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:07,040
Sixty...

216
01:35:07,120 --> 01:35:08,480
Double espresso
kind of day?

217
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:10,520
Back off!
Back the fuck off!

218
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:13,520
Oh, Damini...

219
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:15,320
...you look really stressed.

220
01:35:16,360 --> 01:35:17,160
Detox!

221
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:18,160
You know Mulshi?

222
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:20,520
It's a lakeside town
near Pune.

223
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:23,120
They do some amazing
Vipasana retreat spas.

224
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:24,240
You should really go.

225
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:26,720
Stay out of my shit and
I'll stay out of yours.

226
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:27,520
Please.

227
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:30,600
Didn't you get the memo?

228
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:32,400
I'm here to do your shit.

229
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:34,720
So get off your idealistic
high horse...

230
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:36,000
...and get with the program.

231
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:37,640
Cause I'm here to stay.

232
01:35:42,640 --> 01:35:43,520
C'mon...give it to me.

233
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:44,760
Harder.

234
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:46,720
Give it to me!
Harder!

235
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:47,720
Harder! Harder!

236
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:48,640
I'm trying!

237
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:50,160
Did you see the link?

238
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:52,320
What link?

239
01:35:53,320 --> 01:35:54,240
What link?

240
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:55,880
What link?

241
01:35:56,640 --> 01:35:59,120
So our Siddhi's not
so innocent after all.

242
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:00,200
You saw the link.

243
01:36:00,280 --> 01:36:01,520
You liked what you saw.

244
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:04,520
Listen...

245
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:05,680
...there was this dude...

246
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:08,320
...who was barbecuing in
just an apron!

247
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:09,840
And I kept thinking...

248
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:10,640
...what if...

249
01:36:11,400 --> 01:36:13,720
...what if he barbecued
something else!

250
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:16,360
You know what that
means right?

251
01:36:16,440 --> 01:36:16,840
What?

252
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:19,520
Now when you bake,
you know what you got to do.

253
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:22,400
You know what you got to do!
-Yuck! Mohit you're so dirty!

254
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:26,240
I love you.

255
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:27,120
I love you too.
-Bye.

256
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:28,360
Call me okay?
-I will.

257
01:36:28,440 --> 01:36:29,240
Bye.
-Bye.

258
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:30,440
I love you, bye!

259
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:36,800
When did you come home?

260
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:38,120
If you have any questions,

261
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:39,760
ask away.

262
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:40,640
About what?

263
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:41,840
About...

264
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:43,520
...feelings in the body.

265
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:44,560
Ewww! Mom please!

266
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:46,160
Siddhi!

267
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:48,160
I really like the sound of this.

268
01:36:48,240 --> 01:36:49,560
Siddhi weds Mohit!

269
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:51,960
You know what,
tell me, which do you prefer?

270
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:54,240
#SiMo or #MoSi?

271
01:36:56,200 --> 01:36:57,280
It doesn't matter.

272
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:00,440
I like them both!

273
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:02,080
I'm going to call Kooki aunty!

274
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:08,880
Nothing has changed
in ten years.

275
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:11,080
All the good men are
either taken or gay.

276
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:12,360
Ya...that's right.

277
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:13,640
You guys, one word.

278
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:14,640
Online.

279
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:16,640
But that's for...

280
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:17,560
What? Sex?

281
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:19,000
Meaningless hook-ups?

282
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:20,920
But these days,
every meaningful relationship...

283
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,040
...begins online.

284
01:37:22,120 --> 01:37:23,480
But who would want me?

285
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:24,920
What do you mean?

286
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:27,760
Look at you,
you're hot, successful...

287
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:28,520
And a mom.

288
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:29,680
Ladies.

289
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:31,520
Wow...even before we
could order?

290
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:32,560
It's...

291
01:37:32,640 --> 01:37:33,440
...from them.

292
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:39,080
We're all just a bunch
of vaginas to them.

293
01:37:39,160 --> 01:37:39,960
Ladies,

294
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:41,640
drink up and follow me.

295
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:43,760
Cheers.
-Cheers.

296
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:52,880
Hi boys!

297
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:53,800
Hi girls.

298
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:55,240
So my name is Mayank,

299
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:57,400
this is Sid, Ryan
and Saif.

300
01:37:57,480 --> 01:37:58,560
I'm Umang.

301
01:37:58,640 --> 01:37:59,560
I'm a trainer.

302
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:00,600
Bisexual.

303
01:38:01,160 --> 01:38:02,640
Looking for adventure.

304
01:38:02,720 --> 01:38:04,320
Keep one word in mind.

305
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:05,640
Consent.

306
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:07,080
No anal allowed...

307
01:38:07,160 --> 01:38:09,360
...and oral only if you're
willing to do it as well.

308
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:10,640
I'm Anjana.

309
01:38:10,720 --> 01:38:12,960
A lawyer, a single mother...

310
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:14,800
...and my vagina...

311
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:16,240
...just refuses to come.

312
01:38:18,040 --> 01:38:19,200
I'm Damini.

313
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:22,120
Start-up founder, still,
I hope...

314
01:38:22,640 --> 01:38:23,880
Super smart,
super successful...

315
01:38:23,960 --> 01:38:26,240
...and earns more than all
your combined salaries.

316
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:27,960
I also masturbate pretty often.

317
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:29,800
Much more efficient than sex.

318
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:32,160
I'm Siddhi. I'm a virgin.

319
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:33,480
My mom hates me.

320
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:34,960
She wants me to marry a
pure vegetarian boy...

321
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:36,440
...from the same community.

322
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:38,520
But I love non-veg.

323
01:38:38,600 --> 01:38:40,560
Unfortunately,
I can't kick your ass today...

324
01:38:40,640 --> 01:38:42,960
...because I'm wearing
very high heels but...

325
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:44,680
...what are your plans
for tomorrow?

326
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:50,520
Mangs, stop it!

327
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:51,720
Mangs, stop! Stop!

328
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:52,880
Mangs!
-Dating app upload done!

329
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:54,200
All hail the hook up expert!
-Mangs, stop it!

330
01:38:54,280 --> 01:38:55,520
Mangs! Don't you dare!
-It's done.

331
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:56,640
It's done Anj!

332
01:38:58,080 --> 01:38:59,600
I mean, on one hand,
you say...

333
01:38:59,680 --> 01:39:00,640
...there are no men.

334
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:02,680
And when some poor
guy shows interest...

335
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:04,160
...you scare him away?

336
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:06,280
Please! They were so not
into us!

337
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:07,520
Idiots.

338
01:39:10,280 --> 01:39:11,840
Anyway, on a more
serious note,

339
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:13,400
if you ever have trouble...

340
01:39:13,480 --> 01:39:14,640
...with any of the patrons,

341
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:16,160
just call me.

342
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:18,280
How macho!

343
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:20,160
Will you beat them up
and save us?

344
01:39:20,240 --> 01:39:20,840
Are you crazy?

345
01:39:20,920 --> 01:39:21,880
Not at all.

346
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:22,520
Then?

347
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:24,840
I'll watch them get
thrashed by you girls...

348
01:39:24,920 --> 01:39:26,560
...and I'll make a viral
video of it.

349
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:30,520
How's the dog?

350
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:32,440
Good, I think.

351
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:33,960
What have you named him?

352
01:39:34,360 --> 01:39:35,720
Nothing. He's not mine.

353
01:39:36,040 --> 01:39:37,280
So why make attachments?

354
01:39:37,960 --> 01:39:39,200
I didn't mean it like that,
you know.

355
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:40,840
When you call out to him,

356
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:42,160
what do you say?

357
01:39:43,720 --> 01:39:44,400
Dog.

358
01:39:44,920 --> 01:39:45,600
Dog?

359
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:50,000
An ode to all the men past.

360
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:50,840
Oh please!

361
01:39:51,160 --> 01:39:52,480
All the men!

362
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:54,400
How many men do you
think there have been?

363
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:56,400
It's plural. It can just
as well be two.

364
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:58,040
It's your guilty conscience
talking.

365
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:01,160
It's not my
guilty conscience okay!

366
01:40:02,720 --> 01:40:03,920
How about Xerxes?

367
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:04,920
Who's Xerxes?

368
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:06,600
My 16 year old cousin.

369
01:40:08,720 --> 01:40:11,280
You want me to date
your sixteen year old cousin?

370
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:12,920
No. I mean the dog.

371
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:14,440
How about naming the
dog Xerxes?

372
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:17,160
You want me to name
the dog after your cousin?

373
01:40:17,680 --> 01:40:20,040
Why not? He's cute, fluffy,
he's hairy, he's...

374
01:40:20,120 --> 01:40:20,760
The dog?

375
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:21,520
No.

376
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:22,760
My cousin.

377
01:40:23,240 --> 01:40:24,920
Oh my God! Okay!

378
01:40:27,720 --> 01:40:28,440
One second...

379
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:34,440
Problem?

380
01:40:34,520 --> 01:40:36,480
No, just some work stuff.

381
01:40:37,480 --> 01:40:38,120
Ya...

382
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:40,520
Sorry. Ya...

383
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:41,360
Another drink?

384
01:40:42,720 --> 01:40:44,320
I'm so sorry, stock-taking time.

385
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:46,800
No, of course.

386
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:48,680
Actually even I have
a really early start tomorrow.

387
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:49,720
What was I thinking.

388
01:40:50,160 --> 01:40:51,200
Okay, cool.

389
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:53,000
Thank you for the whiskey.

390
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:54,040
Sure.
-This was great.

391
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:54,640
Ya...

392
01:40:54,720 --> 01:40:55,280
See you.

393
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:56,240
Ciao.

394
01:41:00,440 --> 01:41:02,000
Fuck! You're on fire tonight!

395
01:41:03,480 --> 01:41:05,040
I'm off to New York
tomorrow for two months!

396
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:07,760
You're going to have to
care of yourself for a while!

397
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:09,440
Don't worry, I'm self sufficient.

398
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:10,640
Don't I know that baby!

399
01:41:12,440 --> 01:41:14,400
Damini! I can hear
strange noises.

400
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:16,280
That's just the dog!

401
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:17,720
What do you mean dog!

402
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:18,640
The dog!

403
01:41:19,480 --> 01:41:20,040
Dog?!

404
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:21,840
Shut up!

405
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:24,600
But like...

406
01:41:24,680 --> 01:41:25,640
...the men.

407
01:41:25,720 --> 01:41:26,920
Worse than the women.

408
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:27,920
No matter where you look,

409
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,440
they're moving around with
a six pack obsession.

410
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:31,160
And...

411
01:41:31,240 --> 01:41:32,680
...their hands are tiny...

412
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:34,400
...And their feet are like two--

413
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:35,200
What?

414
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:37,480
Sarkando?
-Sarkando.

415
01:41:37,560 --> 01:41:38,200
Sarkando?

416
01:41:38,280 --> 01:41:39,160
Bamboo sticks.

417
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:41,160
Oh. I had no idea.

418
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:43,640
Sarkando.

419
01:41:44,120 --> 01:41:45,720
Do I need to give
you Hindi lessons too?

420
01:41:47,400 --> 01:41:48,720
All lessons welcome.

421
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:50,280
You know, I'm a fast learner.

422
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:02,960
Oh shit...

423
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:04,120
I'm...I'm sorry.

424
01:42:04,640 --> 01:42:06,160
I don't know
what I was doing.

425
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:13,280
So it's late.

426
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:14,960
And...

427
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:16,080
I'm shooting tomorrow...

428
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:17,040
...early morning.

429
01:42:19,640 --> 01:42:20,200
Okay...

430
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:21,280
Ya, ya…

431
01:42:21,320 --> 01:42:22,240
No problem.

432
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:09,080
Oh my God!
Arya's coming first.

433
01:43:09,160 --> 01:43:11,040
No, no...

434
01:43:11,080 --> 01:43:12,920
...Mama's going to
come first!

435
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:17,680
Hey Ratan...

436
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:20,720
The Mizwani case?

437
01:43:21,800 --> 01:43:23,560
But the concall isn't
till Monday right?

438
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:26,160
Now?

439
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:28,480
I'm in the middle of...

440
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:32,320
Okay fine, I'll see you, bye.

441
01:43:34,680 --> 01:43:37,080
I'm assuring you they can't
sue you, Mr. Mizwani.

442
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:38,920
No, you're not in breach.

443
01:43:39,800 --> 01:43:41,880
I've made a watertight
contract for you, Sir.

444
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:43,640
Yes, Sir.

445
01:43:43,960 --> 01:43:47,040
In fact, we can sue
them for being in breach.

446
01:43:47,080 --> 01:43:48,240
You're very welcome, Sir.

447
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:50,080
That's what I'm here for.

448
01:43:50,160 --> 01:43:51,160
Have a good day.

449
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:54,080
Thank God for you Anjana!

450
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:55,560
Fifty-five bloody minutes!

451
01:43:56,440 --> 01:43:59,160
Can't believe I had to
miss my golf game for this.

452
01:43:59,720 --> 01:44:01,000
One more Saturday gone.

453
01:44:02,280 --> 01:44:04,240
I was just blowing
some balloons.

454
01:44:05,080 --> 01:44:06,920
You know they have
people for that, don't you?

455
01:44:07,560 --> 01:44:10,000
I like organizing
Arya's parties myself.

456
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:11,800
You can't have it all babe.

457
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:20,400
Mom!

458
01:44:25,080 --> 01:44:26,320
Oh my God!

459
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:30,040
Mom, you did this
with Radha?

460
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:30,800
It's...

461
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:32,320
Oh my God!
It's amazing!

462
01:44:32,440 --> 01:44:33,800
I just...

463
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:35,320
I just love it!

464
01:44:35,720 --> 01:44:36,320
Hi...

465
01:44:37,240 --> 01:44:37,800
Hi!

466
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:39,000
Do you like it?

467
01:44:39,400 --> 01:44:40,720
It's...it's amazing.

468
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:42,520
I'm so glad!

469
01:44:43,080 --> 01:44:45,080
Actually, your mom said
you were running a little late...

470
01:44:45,200 --> 01:44:47,760
...so I ran out and bought
some stuff.

471
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:50,080
Sorry...

472
01:44:50,920 --> 01:44:52,680
Did you do all of this?

473
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:53,480
Yes...

474
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:56,080
Wow!

475
01:44:56,880 --> 01:44:59,320
Wow! Thank you.
-I'm so glad that you like it.

476
01:44:59,400 --> 01:45:01,200
Ya, it's really nice.

477
01:45:01,280 --> 01:45:02,640
Thanks so much.
-Yay!

478
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:08,240
Quickly, quickly...

479
01:45:11,640 --> 01:45:14,400
Choo, choo, choo!

480
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:16,800
Come, let's dance?

481
01:45:16,920 --> 01:45:18,080
I'm good, I'm good.
-C'mon...

482
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:20,000
I'm fine. Don't insist please.
-Okay.

483
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:21,480
C'mon...

484
01:45:22,960 --> 01:45:24,720
It's okay.

485
01:45:36,160 --> 01:45:37,160
Yay!

486
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:41,560
One, two, three!

487
01:45:42,200 --> 01:45:44,320
Oh my God!

488
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:47,480
It's the pink scooty!
-Wow!

489
01:45:47,560 --> 01:45:50,200
Baby, I went to four shops
to get this you know?

490
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:52,320
Shall we give Arya our
present as well?

491
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:53,480
Ya c'mon...give, give...

492
01:45:53,560 --> 01:45:54,640
Okay, okay.

493
01:45:54,720 --> 01:45:55,960
Do you like it?

494
01:45:56,040 --> 01:45:58,080
Arya...

495
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:00,160
Teddy!

496
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:02,400
So cute!

497
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:04,760
She really likes him!
-That's so sweet.

498
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:06,720
Arya, do you just love him...

499
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:08,560
...or do you love him?

500
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:10,480
Love him.
Even more than Buttoo.

501
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:12,080
Amazing!
-You want this?

502
01:46:12,160 --> 01:46:13,440
Take Buttoo on scooter...

503
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:14,800
Ya!

504
01:46:14,920 --> 01:46:17,320
Such fun!

505
01:46:19,800 --> 01:46:20,280
Anj...

506
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:23,920
I'm sorry but I have to
say this...

507
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:26,760
...I think she's
trying to make it work.

508
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:27,920
Dee...

509
01:46:28,280 --> 01:46:30,680
I think she's just
trying to steal my kid.

510
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:34,080
Okay, look at this.

511
01:46:35,240 --> 01:46:36,280
It's same same!

512
01:46:37,080 --> 01:46:37,800
Anj, relax!

513
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:39,440
All she's done is bought
a cake!

514
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:40,400
Mad.

515
01:46:42,760 --> 01:46:43,520
Oops!

516
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:45,560
Shit!

517
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:47,560
Had bought a cake rather.

518
01:46:48,240 --> 01:46:50,560
Anj, what is this bitchy
step-wife mode?

519
01:46:50,680 --> 01:46:52,080
I'm scared right now!

520
01:46:52,160 --> 01:46:55,000
It's called bitch-mode baby
and it's on now!

521
01:46:58,400 --> 01:46:59,720
Kavya! What's up man...

522
01:46:59,800 --> 01:47:01,120
Hey! Shit...

523
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:03,760
I'm so sorry Kavya,
you know...

524
01:47:04,280 --> 01:47:06,840
This stupid kid Vivaan
came running and just...

525
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:07,680
No don't...

526
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:09,480
Don't worry about it, it's okay...

527
01:47:09,560 --> 01:47:10,640
No, no, it's fine, it's fine.

528
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:12,200
I'll take care of it.
-It's really fine.

529
01:47:12,280 --> 01:47:13,720
Let me help you.
-No it's fine.

530
01:47:14,120 --> 01:47:16,120
But you know what,
we have another cake.

531
01:47:17,320 --> 01:47:19,520
It's very sweet of you to have,
you know...

532
01:47:20,640 --> 01:47:21,240
It's okay.

533
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:23,680
Help me clean up guys!

534
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:36,080
It's okay.

535
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:38,120
It's okay to be jealous.

536
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:42,800
Mom please!
I'm not jealous.

537
01:47:43,120 --> 01:47:44,960
I asked for the divorce,
remember?

538
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:46,080
I wonder...

539
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:48,000
...what he sees in Kavya.

540
01:47:49,400 --> 01:47:51,400
There's no glow on
her face.

541
01:47:51,480 --> 01:47:53,120
And just look at those
small hips.

542
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:55,400
How on earth will
she deliver a baby?

543
01:47:55,960 --> 01:47:57,160
You are so mean.

544
01:47:58,160 --> 01:48:00,120
She's just tea bags.

545
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:01,040
Only dust.

546
01:48:02,120 --> 01:48:03,800
And you're second flush.

547
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:04,800
Just right.

548
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:15,360
Hey...

549
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:18,000
What are you doing?

550
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:21,360
Taking some of my pictures
with Arya.

551
01:48:22,600 --> 01:48:23,880
We want to make this little...

552
01:48:23,960 --> 01:48:25,480
...album and keep it at home.

553
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:27,040
'We' meaning?

554
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:30,920
Kavs and me.

555
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:32,560
I hope you don't mind.

556
01:48:34,120 --> 01:48:35,000
Remember this one?

557
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:38,320
You come into my home,
ruin my picture album...

558
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:40,320
...you're asking me if
I don't mind.

559
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:41,440
Of course I mind.

560
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:44,280
But you have soft copies
on your computer right?

561
01:48:44,360 --> 01:48:45,640
You can print new copies...

562
01:48:45,720 --> 01:48:47,120
...else I'll get them
printed for you.

563
01:48:47,200 --> 01:48:48,360
It's no big deal.

564
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:52,160
I'm only taking the
ones with Arya and me.

565
01:48:53,480 --> 01:48:55,640
Breaking this family up once
wasn't enough for you?

566
01:48:55,720 --> 01:48:57,520
Fuck man! It's just a
photo album!

567
01:48:57,600 --> 01:48:59,200
It is not just a photo album!

568
01:48:59,280 --> 01:49:01,200
Okay so only you
get to keep her photos?

569
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:03,480
You're the one who's
fucking moving on, okay.

570
01:49:03,560 --> 01:49:05,320
Making a happy family and
home sweet home...

571
01:49:05,400 --> 01:49:06,680
...and all that fucking bullshit!

572
01:49:06,760 --> 01:49:08,080
So you also move on.

573
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:10,760
What's the matter with you?

574
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:14,280
Who's stopping you?

575
01:49:18,520 --> 01:49:19,720
Take this fucking album!

576
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:21,360
This whole fucking damn thing!

577
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:34,560
Move on.

578
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:38,160
I'll fucking show you
what moving on is asshole.

579
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:45,240
Congrats!

580
01:49:46,160 --> 01:49:47,720
So tell me, what do I do now?

581
01:49:48,600 --> 01:49:49,080
Okay...

582
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:50,640
Ball is in your court.

583
01:49:51,120 --> 01:49:51,960
Make a plan...

584
01:49:52,040 --> 01:49:52,840
...and go on a date.

585
01:49:52,920 --> 01:49:53,520
Simple.

586
01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:54,360
With all of them?

587
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:56,000
Anj!

588
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:57,760
You're going on a date,
not opening a harem!

589
01:49:57,840 --> 01:49:58,840
Keep some filters.

590
01:49:58,920 --> 01:49:59,520
Okay...

591
01:49:59,600 --> 01:50:00,480
What kind of filters?

592
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:01,520
Size filters.

593
01:50:01,600 --> 01:50:03,760
You know...how big or small.

594
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:04,720
I'm serious.

595
01:50:05,120 --> 01:50:07,440
I'm serious!
Look at their pictures and decide.

596
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:08,480
Do it now, c'mon!

597
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:10,440
Seven...

598
01:50:11,600 --> 01:50:12,280
Four...

599
01:50:13,640 --> 01:50:14,240
Eight...

600
01:50:16,680 --> 01:50:17,160
Eight...

601
01:50:19,680 --> 01:50:20,440
Six...

602
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:22,480
Fifteen...

603
01:50:23,080 --> 01:50:24,200
What the fuck is fifteen?

604
01:50:24,280 --> 01:50:25,680
He's not a prehistoric man!

605
01:50:25,760 --> 01:50:27,200
Really? It's not that much.

606
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:28,640
I mean fifteen is this much, right?

607
01:50:28,720 --> 01:50:29,480
Oh my God.

608
01:50:29,560 --> 01:50:31,320
No, no, no.
It's like... It's like...

609
01:50:32,720 --> 01:50:33,160
Ya...

610
01:50:35,320 --> 01:50:36,800
You just visualized it,
didn't you?

611
01:50:37,480 --> 01:50:38,800
Shhh!

612
01:50:39,120 --> 01:50:40,160
Arya's sleeping.

613
01:50:40,600 --> 01:50:42,960
What are you all doing outside
in the middle of the night?

614
01:50:43,040 --> 01:50:45,280
Actually aunty, we were doing
something important.

615
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:46,840
We were trying to find
a match for Ms. VeeVee.

616
01:50:46,920 --> 01:50:48,600
But we found one.
It's all good.

617
01:50:48,680 --> 01:50:50,200
Please go back to bed.
Goodnight.

618
01:50:50,280 --> 01:50:50,840
Goodnight mom.

619
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:54,560
I'll walk you to your room.
