1
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,360
<i>You remember the games we played as kids?</i>

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,360
<i>Hide and seek, ludo, snakes and ladders.</i>

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,920
<i>I was up for it all.</i>

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,680
<i>I was born competitive,
and I hated losing.</i>

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,840
Games people play.

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,240
<i>But in adult life, I found the real game.</i>

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,400
<i>The blame game.</i>

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,200
<i>And all of us play that game.</i>

9
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,320
<i>But this time, there's no winning.</i>

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,640
<i>You lose even when you win.</i>

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,040
<i>Because you're left alone.</i>

12
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,160
MMA is a full contact combat sport.

13
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,840
So, yes, I trained very hard.

14
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,720
Six hours a day for six months.

15
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,400
And I tried my best to do
full justice to my character, Shaina.

16
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,000
Speaking of training,

17
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,480
didn't you first meet Umang Singh
for this film as well?

18
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,880
-She was your trainer.
-Yes.

19
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,120
-And fiancée, too.
-She was.

20
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,160
You're here in Mumbai for promotions.
Any plans to meet up with her?

21
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,240
No.

22
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,880
<i>She jilted you at the alter
on the day of your wedding.</i>

23
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,320
<i>Yes. But life happens and I've moved on.</i>

24
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,960
<i>Speaking of which, congratulations.</i>

25
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,320
<i>-Ana and you make a beautiful couple.
-Thank you so much.</i>

26
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,360
I finally know how real love feels.

27
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,880
<i>Can we talk about the film?</i>

28
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,400
Who is she?

29
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,280
Samara's new girlfriend.

30
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,560
Nice. I'm happy for her.

31
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,680
You've been with Meher.

32
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,480
Yeah, but I don't post
lovey-dovey pictures on social media.

33
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,960
What's the problem?
The lovey-dovey pictures?

34
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,800
Or that she moved on before you?

35
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,400
You know you need closure.

36
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,480
-Fuck closure.
-Wow!

37
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,680
Hypocrisy much?

38
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,360
You told me that you invited Mihir
to your wedding because I needed closure.

39
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,920
Why are the rules different?

40
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,160
You're a 5-year-old child.

41
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,080
Stop saying that! I'm not a child.

42
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,560
Tell Sneha you're not a child.

43
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,000
Morning, Mom!

44
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,160
Excuse me. Excuse me.

45
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,480
-Hey.
-Hi!

46
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,800
-You had breakfast in the room?
-Yeah.

47
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,000
I was feeling very lazy,
so I thought, why not order room service?

48
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,680
Okay, Mom, I want to talk to you.

49
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,080
Yeah, let's do that. Come. Let's go down.

50
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,960
We can talk comfortably.
Have you had breakfast?

51
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,240
No, I want to talk now.
I need to say this now.

52
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,720
-I know!
-It's late...

53
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,040
No, Mom, listen to me!

54
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,160
-It's late, and I must...
-But let's...

55
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,960
No. Mom, please listen to me.

56
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,680
Okay, I just wanted to say that

57
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,000
I know the way I have been behaving
for the last few days is very...

58
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,680
I'm not ungrateful, Mom.

59
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,440
I know you planned it all for me,
and I'm actually...

60
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,920
Sneha, there's no toothpaste
in the bathroom.

61
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,560
Hey, Sneha...

62
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,440
Listen, Siddhi...

63
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,360
-I can understand why...
-Siddhi, listen to me.

64
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,640
Wow, fuck, I'm such a fool!

65
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,360
I can't believe that I quit
my course in New York for you!

66
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,800
Which course?

67
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,800
When did you apply for a course?

68
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,560
Well, I applied and I got through!

69
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,920
And then Dad passed away.

70
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,240
And I opted out of the course
because you said you needed me.

71
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,160
But you didn't say

72
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,880
you needed me
until you found Dad's replacement.

73
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,160
Siddhi, it's...

74
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,080
It's not...

75
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,840
You made me wait all my life
for your acceptance.

76
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,920
And now, when Dad is not there anymore,

77
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,840
when we should be a family...

78
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,800
you choose to move on.

79
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,800
No?

80
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,680
What are you saying, darling?

81
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,000
How can I possibly move on from you?

82
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,680
You're...

83
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,440
Morning.

84
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,120
Going for a drive?

85
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,040
Sneha's having sex with Rajan!

86
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,520
Good for her.

87
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,640
Wait. Just calm down.

88
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,200
You calm down!

89
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,640
-You don't understand.
-No, I do.

90
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,240
I do. She got widowed at 48.

91
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,320
Should she spend her life alone?

92
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,360
Alone? How is she alone? She has me!

93
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,800
But then you'll get your own life. Then?

94
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,200
Siddhi, what are you doing? Just relax!

95
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,320
Don't say that!

96
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,480
Think from Sneha's perspective.

97
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,920
And shit like that! Why should I?

98
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,720
-Does she think from my perspective?
-Dude...

99
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,400
Relax.

100
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,600
You're being selfish and unreasonable.

101
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,680
How...

102
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,560
-How can you say that?
-Because it's true!

103
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,280
How long will you carry on this attitude?

104
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,880
When you broke off our engagement,

105
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,360
I listened to you. When you... Siddhi!

106
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,120
What are you doing?

107
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,400
When you said
there's nothing between us, I listened.

108
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,800
But now I feel like
I was just listening to a child.

109
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,480
Not an adult.

110
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,720
You need to be a real adult, not play one.

111
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,400
But I was trying to be an adult.

112
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,480
I was trying to take charge of my life.

113
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,040
I was gonna do that course in New York.

114
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,040
And I sacrificed it for Sneha.

115
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,280
And you know, she has never sacrificed
anything for me. Never!

116
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,440
See, now that's a child talking.

117
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,400
You want your mom to pay you back.
That's quid pro quo, not sacrifice.

118
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,560
Siddhi, you're upset
with yourself, not your mom,

119
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,000
because your dreams fell through,
so don't blame your mom.

120
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,280
Sorry.

121
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,520
I'll sit with Siddhi.

122
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,280
-Did you have a nice time?
-Yes.

123
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,440
Are you alone?

124
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,480
Do you wanna be my friend?

125
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,760
Let's do it!

126
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,960
Cheer up, dude.

127
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,280
Bye-bye.

128
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,040
Good night, darling.

129
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,440
Were we this good when we were together?

130
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,320
We've evolved.

131
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,600
You mean we are older now?

132
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,760
I mean you are older now.

133
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,640
Yeah, I guess we needed to grow up

134
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,320
before being together.

135
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,640
And by we, I mean mostly me.

136
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,600
I agree.

137
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,720
Whatever it is, I like it.

138
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,520
Yeah.

139
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,280
Me, too.

140
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,400
There's a courier for Shashank Bose.

141
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,480
-One second.
-Yeah, give it to me.

142
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,480
Yeah, I'll connect you, ma'am.

143
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,640
He has a meeting
scheduled for 10:00 pm tomorrow.

144
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,120
May I?

145
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,320
Of course.

146
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,360
Yes, one minute.

147
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,440
He has a meeting at 2:00 pm tomorrow.

148
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,720
One minute. Yes.

149
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,400
{\an8}LOVE
MUMBAI

150
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,760
See.

151
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,160
-What?
-Here you go, girls.

152
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,000
-Thank you!
-Have a good time.

153
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,960
Thank you, Sneha.

154
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,880
Thank you.

155
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,520
Am I a horrible person?

156
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,480
No. But you did a horrible thing.

157
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,120
And I feel horrible about it.

158
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,240
As you should.

159
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,360
You behaved like an extremely selfish,
immature, spoiled brat.

160
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,520
Mihir said the same.

161
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,280
So, you realized it when Mihir told you.

162
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,800
And when we say it,
you always reply, "Fuck you!"

163
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,840
You know what it is?
Because she's not attracted to us.

164
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,920
Like, the next time
we have a talk with you,

165
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,560
we should wear Mihir masks.

166
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,280
Stop it! I'm not attracted to him!

167
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,560
Yeah, right.

168
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,280
Anyway, how do I fix
the Rajan-Sneha fiasco?

169
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,640
Maybe start by saying sorry?

170
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,800
Tell her that she should live
the way she wants to.

171
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,400
Yeah, seriously.
Go to Sneha and say, "Mom.

172
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,440
Forget everything that happened.
Everything's fine now."

173
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,720
Speaking of "Everything is fine,"

174
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,120
Samara is dating somebody new.

175
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,960
Yeah, I saw.

176
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,920
Some pictures somewhere.

177
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,160
And I slept with Sean.

178
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,600
I should've bet.
I would've made so much money.

179
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,160
Shut up, please.

180
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,000
I slept with Dhananjay.

181
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,840
-Oh, God, Dee!
-Dee?

182
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,520
Just physical. Nothing else.

183
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,640
Liar! It's a lot more than that,
and you know it.

184
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,160
I'm thinking

185
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,840
of giving Varun another chance.

186
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,280
But Kavya? What about her?

187
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,320
Kavya is going through with the divorce.

188
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,440
What are we doing, guys?

189
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,280
Finally, we're doing what we want to.

190
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,920
We're just making our own choices.

191
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,960
Good, bad, ugly, whatever it is.

192
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,320
I'm sure the world thinks
that we're really fucking up but...

193
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,560
So, we're fucking up!

194
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,560
Right?

195
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,360
So, here's to fucking up.

196
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,280
Yes! Here's to fucking up.

197
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,840
Yeah, here's to fucking up.

198
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,440
-To fucking up.
-To fucking up!

199
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,000
That feels good.

200
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,760
Cupcakes?

201
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,360
Apology.

202
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,280
For behaving like a selfish,
spoiled, entitled brat.

203
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,400
No.

204
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,880
Siddhi, you put your life on hold for me.

205
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,120
I'm the one that should be apologizing.

206
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,080
No, Mom. I was horrible to you.
I'm so sorry.

207
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,680
You have every right to move on
and live your life.

208
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,000
Siddhi, darling, I'm not moving anywhere.

209
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,160
I'm here with you.

210
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,960
Will you please call Rajan?

211
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,240
No, Siddhi.

212
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,160
Mom, he understands
what you're going through.

213
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,600
He's also lost a life partner.

214
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,760
Both of you need each other.

215
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,560
We need each other.

216
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,200
You and me.

217
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,840
But I know you have a big heart.

218
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,880
Can't it fit me, Dad, Rajan,
all three of us?

219
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,760
Don't forget to use protection.

220
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,040
I want to remain the only child. Okay?

221
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,480
-Siddhi, behave!
-You behave.

222
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,440
Can we talk?

223
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,560
Why talk?

224
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,520
Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am?

225
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,080
Now with that out of the way,

226
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,800
can we talk?

227
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,080
I'm hungry. Wanna eat?

228
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,440
Okay.

229
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,000
Arya, see which one you like for Grandma.

230
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,760
-The blue one.
-Even I like it.

231
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,200
<i>Row, row, row your boat</i>

232
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,080
<i>Merrily down the street</i>

233
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,640
Arav!

234
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,080
Come, my mom is there.

235
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,400
Mom, look who's here.

236
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,160
Arav.

237
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,960
Hi, Kavya. Hi, Auntie.

238
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,440
-Hi, Anjana.
-Check it out.

239
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,240
With these stripes,
I look like Prisoner No. 1, right?

240
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,240
Hey, Kavs.

241
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,560
Mom.

242
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,680
Hi, champ!

243
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,040
Come here.

244
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,920
You've grown up so much.

245
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,080
So big he's become.

246
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,000
You hate malls and shopping.

247
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,440
Yeah, no, I...

248
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,680
Sometimes, you know...

249
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,680
No, you know what, it's fine.

250
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,560
We can all just keep changing.

251
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,920
It's fine.

252
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,920
Mom, let's go.

253
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,440
Let's go.

254
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,880
Why is Auntie angry?

255
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,440
Arya, she just wants to...

256
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,440
-I want to be with Arav.
-Arya!

257
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,440
Hey!

258
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,320
-Arya.
-Arya!

259
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,680
-Arya.
-Arya, stop it.

260
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,800
-Stop it!
-Arya, stop.

261
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,760
-Arya!
-Arya, stop it!

262
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,400
Arya, just stop!

263
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,960
What... What happened?

264
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,280
He's okay.

265
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,560
You know, he wanted custody
and I stopped him!

266
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,400
This is how you repay me?

267
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,720
Kav...

268
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,560
Kavya, I never meant it to be this.

269
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,200
You didn't mean it?

270
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,920
You didn't do anything? It just happened?

271
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,200
Take a look at yourselves, both of you!

272
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,400
What have you both turned into?

273
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,240
-Jeh.
-Hey, Dee.

274
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,240
Listen, I was thinking,

275
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,400
can Bosco handle the bar tomorrow?

276
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,320
He could. Why?

277
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,800
Fundraiser party for Dhananjay.

278
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,320
Not like I'll make a huge donation.

279
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,440
Can you come along to support me?

280
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,960
-Fine.
-Thanks.

281
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,680
Shashank!

282
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,680
Shashank, what...

283
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,400
-What are you doing?
-My divorce came through.

284
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,640
She cleaned me out.

285
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,640
I'm sorry.

286
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,960
Are you happy now?

287
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,720
Why would I be?

288
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,440
You wanna see me suffer.

289
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,640
-Why would I want that?
-Because you fucking hate me!

290
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,920
I don't hate you.

291
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,040
-Then why did you leave me?
-Come on!

292
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,240
I didn't leave you.
We were never together.

293
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,040
You can keep lying to yourself.
We were in a fucking relationship!

294
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,240
A so-called relationship based on a lie?

295
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,880
Don't get all sanctimonious.

296
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,200
You bloody well knew I was married.
From day fucking one!

297
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,680
I didn't know you were lying
about being in an open marriage.

298
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,480
Shashank, till today I ask myself

299
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,400
what the fuck was I doing?
What was I doing with you?

300
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,360
What was I doing to myself?
What was I doing to Arya?

301
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,280
Didn't it mean anything?

302
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,840
Did I mean nothing to you?

303
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,120
Doesn't matter anymore.

304
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,920
How can it not?

305
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,240
What the fuck were you doing with me?

306
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,600
I...

307
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,320
I just...

308
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,920
I just needed to feel...

309
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,000
needed. I needed to feel desired.

310
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,000
Even if

311
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,200
just for a second.

312
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,680
I was tired of myself.

313
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,400
I was tired

314
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,520
of being this boring workaholic.

315
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,840
I was tired of being a mom, a lawyer.

316
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,120
I was tired

317
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,440
of wondering, where did that Anjana go?

318
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:52,040
That 26-year-old
who so loved life, freedom, and success.

319
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:52,960
She...

320
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,800
Instead she became, what, a single mother?

321
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,680
Fighting the boys' club at a firm?

322
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,240
This is not what I dreamt of, Shashank.
This is not what I wanted.

323
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,160
Hello.

324
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,240
There you are.

325
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,280
Great turnout, right?

326
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,240
Your guest list.

327
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,760
They had to come. Seriously, none of this
would be possible without you.

328
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,880
Looking beautiful.

329
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,520
Thank you.

330
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,360
-You have met, of course.
-Hey, Jeh.

331
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,680
Hi, I'm Damini.

332
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,360
-Hi, I'm Lara.
-Nice to meet you.

333
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,440
Is that bar issue resolved?

334
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,760
It's India. It'll take some time.

335
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,000
My offer still stands.
Reach out if you need help.

336
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,600
Mr. Deshpande, we're ready for you.

337
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,640
Sure.

338
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,560
Damini?

339
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,920
Go ahead. This is your moment.

340
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,120
Come on, we're a team.

341
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,720
Come on.

342
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,840
I'll look after her.

343
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,400
See you in a bit.

344
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:01,160
{\an8}As lawyers, we keep oscillating
between what's right, what's wrong.

345
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,040
To win for our client,

346
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,800
we use a couple of clauses
to bring out the truth.

347
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,480
And now we don't even realize

348
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,680
what's truth and what's not anymore.

349
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,240
I wasn't happily married.

350
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,840
And that's my truth.

351
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,760
I was looking for an escape and...

352
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,200
And the escape happened to be you.

353
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,720
Sushmita and me
were over a long time back.

354
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,920
I should thank you for that at least.

355
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,120
Then I should thank you, too.

356
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,640
For making me realize
what I want from life.

357
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,400
Does it get better?

358
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,480
Hoping fucking so.

359
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,960
I'm gonna get a stiff drink for myself.

360
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,400
I'm gonna offer you one as well.

361
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,200
I would love some.

362
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,760
Okay.

363
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,400
I am rising above the party politics
and my surname, Deshpande,

364
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,440
and taking my first step
towards clean, inclusive governance.

365
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,120
And I'm really glad that all of you
are with me in this journey.

366
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,560
But the person who stood by me before you,

367
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,480
is someone I would like to introduce.

368
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,640
So, please welcome

369
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,840
my biggest supporter
and my strongest critic,

370
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,960
Damini Rizvi Roy.

371
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,520
You and Dhananjay?

372
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,040
We only met once before
at a cousin's wedding.

373
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,120
Let's see where it goes.

374
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:03,160
We always say
that the Assembly needs fresh faces.

375
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,200
But we don't do anything about it.

376
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,840
So, here's our chance.

377
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:12,440
This is our chance
to replace corruption in this country

378
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:17,040
with education, employment
and health care facilities.

379
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,000
Then, here's our chance.

380
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:24,800
And I urge you to please support Dhananjay
and his campaign wholeheartedly.

381
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,040
Thank you for being here tonight.
It means the world to us.

382
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,160
Thank you.

383
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,400
It's a shame your dad couldn't make it.

384
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,760
-I know.
-Your dad was coming?

385
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,760
He was thinking of coming.

386
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,240
He knew Dhananjay's parents

387
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,200
when Mr. Deshpande was an MP
at the parliament.

388
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,800
-Our moms are on an education panel.
-Yeah.

389
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,520
We played together
when we were in diapers.

390
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,400
Really?

391
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,280
Mom found a picture.
I'll show it to you next time.

392
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,720
-What?
-Yeah.

393
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,120
I'd love to see that.

394
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,240
Imagine, if my dad got re-elected,

395
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,320
we would've grown up together,
gone to the same school.

396
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,040
Probably gone to conti together,
maybe even dated.

397
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,280
Who knows, right?

398
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,720
Conti?

399
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:22,560
It's a co-ed,
Delhi farewell party, sort of. Right?

400
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,360
-Like a prom of sorts.
-Yeah.

401
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:31,320
And everyone gets trashed
and it always ends really badly.

402
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,600
I remember my conti.

403
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:38,960
Every single guy at the party hit on me.
I was one of the hottest girls.

404
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,080
Sweet.

405
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:44,680
Well, no past means no extra baggage.

406
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,600
Which means that I can do
the job of your campaign manager

407
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,960
with utmost objectivity.

408
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,400
Such a professional.

409
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,000
-That's why you hired me.
-That's true.

410
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,640
-You guys make a great team.
-That we do.

411
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,000
Jeh!

412
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,840
Please slow down.

413
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,320
Jeh, slow down!

414
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,600
Jeh!

415
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,720
Jeh!

416
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,520
What the fuck, Jeh? What the fuck!

417
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,000
I'm sorry.

418
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,080
-I don't know what happened.
-I'm walking home.

419
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,800
Why doesn't Dhananjay give you a ride?

420
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,240
Since you make a great team.

421
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,000
There it is.

422
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,800
It's always your silence,
isn't it, Damini?

423
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,920
Damini, what's the time?

424
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,560
Silence.

425
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,320
Damini, what would you like for dinner?

426
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,680
Silence.

427
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,160
Damini, is there a problem
with this relationship?

428
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,320
Silence.

429
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,800
Damini, I'm fucking drowning.

430
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,080
Silence.

431
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,440
Go sleep at your place tonight.

432
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,000
It doesn't bother you
that we're not having sex.

433
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,880
It doesn't bother me?

434
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,080
It doesn't bother me?

435
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,360
What the fuck
do you want me to do, Damini?

436
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,240
What do I do?
Should I force myself onto you?

437
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,000
When I come close to you,
you pretend to be sleeping.

438
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,160
If you return a little earlier from work,

439
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,800
you hide in the bathroom
till I fall asleep.

440
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,760
You need to get drunk to have sex with me!

441
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,160
Can we not do this
in the middle of the street?

442
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,040
But you're the one
itching to have a fight.

443
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,800
I mean, I crack a joke,

444
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,720
and you're fighting.

445
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,160
Your jokes aren't jokes.
They're judgements.

446
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,360
You're constantly judging me
with your rigid moral codes.

447
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,160
Damini is drunk, wow!

448
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,200
She wants to have drunk sex, so bad.

449
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,200
Damini is knocked up
with someone else's baby, so bad!

450
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,160
We weren't even together then.

451
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,800
Jeh doesn't care
about the fine print, right?

452
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,600
It's always about, "How can she do this?"

453
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,560
You're constantly judging me!

454
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,200
Damini and Dhananjay make a great team.
They must've slept together!

455
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,000
You know what? Guess what?

456
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,040
You are right for once. I did.

457
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,640
Fuck you, Damini.

458
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,360
Fuck you, Damini!

459
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,960
You're a serial cheater!

460
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,440
-Fuck you!
-There it is.

461
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,520
The judgement. There it is!

462
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,600
If I slip even a millimeter, Jeh,

463
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:15,080
you turn into the judge, jury, lawyer,
hangman and hand me a death sentence!

464
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,360
Everything is black and white for you.

465
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,560
And if you haven't noticed yet,
I'm not perfect.

466
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,920
And I'm tired

467
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:27,200
of carrying the weight of your perfection.

468
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,800
I'm tired of it, Jeh!

469
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,760
I'm always scared.

470
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,720
I'm always scared that one mistake,
and you're gonna dump me.

471
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,280
Well, I made a mistake, so dump me.
Come on, dump me!

472
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,600
You're right, Damini.

473
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,240
We've been struggling for a long time.

474
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,720
In fact, we've always been struggling.

475
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,880
So, what are you saying?

476
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,440
I'm saying that it's over, Damini.

477
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,480
