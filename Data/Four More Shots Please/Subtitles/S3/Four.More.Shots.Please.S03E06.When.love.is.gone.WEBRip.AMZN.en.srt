1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,120
<i>Where do lovers go when love is gone?</i>

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,200
<i>Even after separation, some part of them
probably remains with us.</i>

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,280
<i>Unshakable ghosts we carry around
with us wherever we go.</i>

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,880
<i>So, can two lovers
really part from each other?</i>

5
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,760
Sids.

6
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,440
Throw punches, not swat flies.

7
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,960
I'm trying.

8
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,760
You need a session with Sean.

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,880
Gladly! He's so hot!

10
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,160
What? It's called motivation.

11
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,800
-Who's next?
-"Who's next?"

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,920
-Not me!
-Sorry.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Try me.

14
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,080
Hi, Meher. What brings you here?

15
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,760
Just followed your recommendation.
Love it.

16
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,800
-Hi.
-Hi!

17
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,840
I'm Meher.

18
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,160
Sorry. Anjana,

19
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,880
Damini, Siddhi, my business partner.

20
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,840
-Meher, of course, is my client.
-Your student.

21
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,360
Got a good drink?

22
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,880
-Depends. What's your poison of choice?
-What's yours?

23
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,360
On special days, vodka shots.

24
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,880
I'll just go get my drink. See you around?

25
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,040
-See you.
-Bye!

26
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,080
-Bye. Nice meeting you.
-Bye.

27
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,440
What?

28
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,400
-She's stalking you.
-No way.

29
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,600
She "followed your recommendation"
or followed you?

30
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,520
Girl, this is called stalking.

31
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,040
Chill out, guys.

32
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,880
She's cool.
She's had a tough life. Be easy.

33
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,520
But don't make your life tough for her.

34
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,880
Why would I do that?

35
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,760
Because we all make
these amazingly stupid decisions at times.

36
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,520
Guys, she's single. I'm single.

37
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,400
She just got out of a bad marriage.
I got out of a terrible breakup.

38
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,920
As you know, we're good.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,360
Okay, if you say so.

40
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,920
I'm gonna go check on her.

41
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,600
And grab your poison!

42
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,480
Can someone tell me what a "non-date" is?

43
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,200
Here I am, struggling
to find a normal date.

44
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,360
I get dates only in one format.

45
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,080
DD-MM-YY.

46
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,960
My mom on the other hand,
is scoring non-dates as well.

47
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,000
Okay, I'm gonna ask you.

48
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,840
Has any one of your moms
been on a non-date?

49
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,280
Keep moms out of this!

50
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,640
What's wrong, sir?
There's no reason to get offended.

51
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,880
Everyone is free to date.
Be it your mom or mine.

52
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,760
Unless, you think women over 50
should just close their hearts.

53
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,720
And their legs.

54
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,760
Who said that? Did you hear that?
The patriarchy spoke. Can I see you?

55
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,760
Here's another feminazi.
She hasn't cracked a decent joke yet.

56
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,600
If my jokes are beyond your IQ,
that's not my problem, okay?

57
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,200
-Idiots.
-Record this.

58
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,680
-She called us idiots.
-Because you are.

59
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,120
What are you gonna do? Go on, record it.

60
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,560
Wanna put it on Twitter? #NotAllMen.

61
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,200
Please stop. The show's over.

62
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,240
-Stop!
-Fuck you!

63
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,480
Calm down.

64
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,200
Fuck you, motherfuckers!

65
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,560
Who do they think they are? Let go of me!

66
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,400
-Can you calm down?
-I'm calm!

67
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,440
If this is calm, I'm the queen of Patiala.

68
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,440
I'm calm, okay?

69
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,600
What the fuck, Umang!

70
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,760
When Indians repeatedly say "fuck,"
they seem wannabe.

71
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,680
What else should I say?
Making love? Physical relations? Coitus?

72
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,120
What's happening?

73
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,520
I'm being yelled at, heckled
and manhandled. That's what.

74
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,360
We mean why are you so angry?

75
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,800
What would you do?

76
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,880
As a comic, turn insults into jokes!
Use it as material.

77
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,120
Easier said than done! Don't talk shit.

78
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,800
You can't get a punchline right!

79
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,640
-Sids?
-Siddhi, listen.

80
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,000
-Let's just sit and talk.
-About what?

81
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,040
How my dad died and my mom is
acting like he never existed!

82
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,920
Sids, it's all gonna be fine.

83
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,000
How do you know?

84
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,560
Exactly.

85
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:47,800
Send me greeting cards with,
"It's gonna be fine," "Time heals all!"

86
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,560
I'm done for today, man. I'm just...

87
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,360
-Hey.
-You okay?

88
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,160
Walk me back to the bakery?

89
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,440
-Sure.
-I'll give you a treat.

90
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,840
With our eyes closed,
our senses become sharper.

91
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,960
Now, open your mouth.

92
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,400
Lemon?

93
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,920
Yes, it is. Ready?

94
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,440
-White butter?
-No.

95
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,240
I'm sorry. I'm messing this up.

96
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,760
-You'll get this one.
-I'm so bad at this.

97
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,680
-What is that? Gross.
-Also called olive tapenade.

98
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,800
I like this. I had it with Siddhi once.

99
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,400
Wow. I guess I really need to see my food.

100
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,840
I'm sorry, I messed up your experiment.

101
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,480
Experiment is still on.

102
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,640
How so?

103
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,680
I'm sorry. Shit.

104
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,960
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry
for my <i>Eat Pray Love</i> type notions.

105
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,480
I'm sorry. That was so silly. Sorry.

106
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,000
-Meher.
-I'm sorry.

107
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,520
It's not silly. It's not silly.

108
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,960
<i>Varun, please come out.
I don't want to see you take a dump.</i>

109
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,840
Anj, just come in!

110
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,880
Varun.

111
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,360
I'm in the zone, baby!

112
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,880
Like, I'm in the zone.

113
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,520
One, I'm not your baby.

114
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,120
Two, this is a bathroom, not your study.

115
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,040
Get out.

116
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,200
But here, it really gets going...
This inspiration.

117
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,120
-The bathroom?
-No, Anj, this house!

118
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,400
With the two of you.

119
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,640
You're welcome. I'll send the bill.
Now get out. Please!

120
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,320
I kid you not,

121
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,480
I wrote the first act of the script
in just two days!

122
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,200
It's a freaking miracle, man!

123
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,440
Wow. What's the story?

124
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,640
You wanna know the story?

125
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,960
You can read it when it's ready.

126
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,720
Come out and finish it.
I have to go to work to get paid!

127
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,640
-I'll shoot you.
-Varun...

128
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,360
Give it everything, man! Let's go.

129
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,160
-Nice!
-Ma'am.

130
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,280
-Yeah?
-She's here to meet you.

131
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,640
Hi. Thanks.
Do we have a session or something?

132
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,880
No, I'm Tara, Meher's daughter?

133
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,000
Tara. Hi! Nice to meet you.

134
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,760
So nice to meet you.
Mom keeps talking about you all the time.

135
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,520
I was beginning to feel insecure.

136
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,960
She's my best friend.

137
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,200
Yeah, she said so.

138
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,760
I don't want her to get hurt.

139
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,240
She's been hurt enough.

140
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,160
I saw that she was so happy,
and she's really into you.

141
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,280
Just take care of her. Will you?

142
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,640
Welcome to the family.

143
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,720
That poor junior lawyer.

144
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,080
You had him considering
going back to law school.

145
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,880
The way you attacked his boss,
I thought you'd punch him.

146
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,200
I was about to.
But I realized he might hit me back.

147
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,640
I can't let anything happen
to this chiseled jaw.

148
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,280
You complimented yourself?

149
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,920
You never compliment me.
So I have to do it myself.

150
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,840
Okay, fine.

151
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,240
Your handwriting is beautiful.

152
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,240
What?

153
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,080
You don't let your guard down.

154
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,600
I'm glad that we're in sync again.
Clients are happy, billable hours are up.

155
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,680
What a relief!

156
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,960
Bose and Menon are the best team
since Gandhi and Nehru.

157
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,520
I think we should seal this with a selfie.

158
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,240
No... I'll move this back.
Gotta get you...

159
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,280
I might have to cross
the Atlantic Ocean for this one.

160
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,720
But you don't have a visa.
You will be deported.

161
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,240
Diplomatic passport. I come in peace.

162
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,000
I think this is better.

163
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,960
One, two, three.

164
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,600
And we still look good together.

165
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,920
And it's time
for your trans-Atlantic swim back.

166
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,680
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

167
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,000
Tara loved you.

168
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,000
She's nice and she loves you.

169
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,920
Let's go to the Maldives.

170
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm serious.

171
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,880
Just imagine.

172
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:09,640
All day sun, sand, scenery, sex.

173
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,520
Yeah.

174
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,520
I can't even afford a trip to Goa and...

175
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,040
It's on me, Umang.

176
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,120
Come with me to the Maldives.

177
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,040
It's my dream.

178
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,000
I'll take care of everything.

179
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,440
Everything set?

180
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,720
She's coming.

181
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,040
-Surprise!
-Surprise!

182
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,480
My God!

183
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,600
Arav! Hi, baby!

184
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,320
How come he's here?

185
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,720
Kavya's mom left him.

186
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,120
Hi!

187
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,520
Arav and I played games,
and then Dada and I made dinner.

188
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,280
SALAD - PASTA

189
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,200
Pasta la Vista!

190
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,480
{\an8}Please, come sit right over here, madam.
Welcome to our restaurant.

191
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,760
{\an8}-And...
-Thank you.

192
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,080
Here, we have... At Pasta la Vista

193
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,520
we have salad because you love salad.

194
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,640
Pasta sauce made by Madam Arya.

195
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,640
And also salad dressing.
She's a master chef.

196
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,560
-Please sit.
-So proud of you.

197
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,800
-And?
-I mashed the apples for Arav.

198
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,000
You are my big little girl.

199
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,680
I love your hats! Who made those?

200
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,480
-Arya, of course!
-Yeah...

201
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,360
Ma'am, just look at the kitchen.
It's like a bomb exploded there.

202
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,640
Of course. Exploding bombs is all I do.

203
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,040
-I agree.
-Forget about it.

204
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,080
You both.

205
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,640
Come, let's eat now.

206
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,440
So, I said, "Arya,

207
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,000
"rumble in the tummy means
it's poopy-time."

208
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,040
So I went to the potty and then...

209
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,800
I pooped.

210
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,680
At the same time, Dada needed to poop.

211
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,000
-God!
-We were pooping in different bathrooms.

212
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,880
And calling out to each other.

213
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,480
-Poopy la Vista!
-Poopy la Vista!

214
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,200
And then what happened?

215
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:10,040
And then, Arav pooped in his diapers.

216
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,000
Really?

217
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,000
It was so stinky! So stinky!

218
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,640
Like one big poopy family.

219
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,000
I hope you changed his diaper.

220
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,280
Kavya ma'am is here.

221
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,440
-Kavs?
-Kavya, hi.

222
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,200
-Come, join us.
-Yes, please.

223
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,960
Is Arav's diaper bag ready?

224
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,440
The diaper bag is...

225
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,200
-I'll get it.
-I'll do it.

226
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,040
I will.
I don't want to spoil your family dinner.

227
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,680
-Hi, baby.
-Pooky Auntie.

228
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,760
Dada is gonna stay here forever.
Why don't you send Arav?

229
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,520
Arya, stop talking nonsense!

230
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,160
Come on.

231
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,880
-Kavya...
-Kavs.

232
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,360
Kavs, come on.

233
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,920
Listen, just have a conversation.

234
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,720
I don't understand
how you can block me out of your life.

235
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,400
You got what you wanted.

236
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,440
Your old family.

237
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,480
Come on, Kavs.

238
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,000
-What's up?
-I was thinking.

239
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,440
-What?
-About our future.

240
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,520
-Ever think about it?
-All the time.

241
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,480
-And?
-The elections are soon.

242
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,720
I feel I need to push
Dhananjay's image out there, you know?

243
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,640
He has a chance of winning.

244
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,920
Politics seems to really suit me.

245
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,160
Who would've thought?

246
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,440
Over the last two months,

247
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,960
it's made me feel so alive again.

248
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,960
Made me, me.

249
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,520
You know?

250
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,240
I meant about us.

251
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,680
Yeah.

252
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,440
Right. Of course. My God. Of course!

253
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,120
Jeh, but you're the one
who's not moving in.

254
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,720
-Hi.
-Hey, guys!

255
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,800
-Hey.
-Hi.

256
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,040
-Hi.
-I'll send over the usual.

257
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,080
Sorry about the other day.

258
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,080
Chill. It happens to all of us.

259
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,720
Be as cranky as you want.

260
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,280
Bra code.

261
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,880
Anyway, Dee,

262
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,000
is everything cool with you and Jeh?

263
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,520
We just need to have sex.

264
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,760
The sex band-aid?

265
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,960
I'll take care of it.

266
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:53,080
By the way, are the words
"take care" tattooed on my forehead?

267
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,920
'Cause everyone in my life
tries to take care of me.

268
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,160
-Did you sleep with Meher?
-Mangs?

269
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,560
Hope it was a one-time thing?

270
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,040
And never to be repeated.

271
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,440
Deliberately and repeatedly, actually.

272
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,320
She's really nice. And hot!

273
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,560
Classic rebound.

274
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,320
And I met her daughter.
Actually, she came and met me.

275
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,680
It was like an ambush.

276
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,880
Do you want a relationship with her?

277
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,480
I don't know.
I just got out of an intense relationship.

278
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:30,320
You have a savior complex.
You need an injured bird to heal.

279
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,080
Sids, you are my favorite
little injured bird.

280
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,240
And if I change, who will heal you?

281
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,920
Fuck off, Mangs.

282
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,280
-It was a joke.
-My life seems like a joke to you guys.

283
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,920
Keep laughing. I'm leaving.

284
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,440
-Move.
-Sids, it was a joke. Like...

285
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,520
Sids!

286
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,200
It was a joke, man.

287
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,400
What's wrong with her?

288
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,440
I need more wine.

289
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,520
Need another bottle.

290
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,160
There he is.

291
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,560
Hey, bartender.

292
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,960
Another glass of wine, please.

293
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,240
Fourth glass of wine.

294
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,920
Check my driver's license. I'm an adult.

295
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,520
Bosco, wine please! Thank you.

296
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,080
-Tonight's the night, girls.
-Take it easy, Dee.

297
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,080
Dee's not easy. Easy is not Dee.

298
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,800
Hi, baby.

299
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,440
-Come on, Damini.
-At last.

300
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,040
-Come on. Don't fall.
-I can walk.

301
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,000
Let's dance.

302
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,960
It's time for bed.

303
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,480
-No, let's dance.
-Come on, it's time for bed.

304
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,160
No, it's not time for bed.

305
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,720
-Dancing!
-I'm too tired to dance.

306
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,080
-Come on.
-Damini, come on.

307
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,480
-Come on.
-You're slipping off the bed.

308
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,400
I'm taking your shoes off.

309
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,880
-It's time for bed. You have to sleep.
-Come on, please come.

310
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,240
Dee, it's time for...

311
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,560
Dee. It's time for bed. Damini.

312
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,280
Damini.

313
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,640
Already?

314
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,800
Damini, stop!

315
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,480
-Why?
-Not like this.

316
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,440
Why?

317
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,760
Am I that repulsive?

318
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,920
No, but I am, since you need
four glasses of wine to have sex with me.

319
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,560
How should I feel about that?

320
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,440
You're judging me for how much I drink?

321
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
No!

322
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,880
You're getting it all wrong.

323
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,720
There's something wrong here, Damini.

324
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,200
Something really wrong.

325
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,760
What?

326
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,960
What?

327
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,440
-What's wrong?
-I don't know, Dee. You tell me.

328
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,520
You don't wanna talk about feelings.

329
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,320
I did talk about my feelings.

330
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,080
But Myra interrupted us.

331
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,920
-Myra?
-Remember?

332
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,080
That one time?

333
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,960
Why am I held to such high standards?

334
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,320
Jeh...

335
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,240
You know what?

336
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,560
I'm out of here.

337
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,280
What?

338
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,200
Jeh!

339
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,920
Okay. Run away.

340
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,680
Run away like always.

341
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,400
Jeh doesn't do confrontations.
He's a goody-two-shoes.

342
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,560
Such a good boy. May you be blessed.

343
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,200
Jeh...

344
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,320
Jeh?

345
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,440
Jeh?

346
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,640
Jeh!

347
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,560
<i>The number you've called
is currently switched off.</i>

348
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,520
<i>You can now leave a voice SMS

00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,040

351
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,040
Fuck. Jeh!

352
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,280
Dhananjay, no, I...

353
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,680
It's nothing, I'm looking for Jeh.
He just left.

354
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,720
We had a really bad fight.

355
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,680
Okay, bye. I can't talk right now.

356
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,680
Look, I'm...

357
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,920
I'm no expert in relationships, but...

358
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,640
I'm here if you wanna talk.

359
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,280
He wants to talk as well.

360
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,520
And?

361
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,120
No matter how hard I try,

362
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,840
I can't bring myself to talk to Jeh.

363
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:01,360
It's almost like my brain goes blank
when I see him.

364
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,480
Don't you trust him?

365
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,040
More than I trust myself.

366
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,200
It's just that I fucked up
so much with him in the past.

367
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:17,080
Are you afraid he'll leave you
if he knows the real Damini?

368
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,160
I didn't even want a baby.

369
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:28,240
Now all of a sudden,
I could almost see her.

370
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,240
Smell her. Touch her.

371
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,400
Feel her.

372
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,000
It was going to be a girl.

373
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,160
Obviously.

374
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,520
Whenever something goes right in my life,
why does it have to go away?

375
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,960
Hey, you're alive.

376
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,640
You're healthy.

377
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,720
You're smart as hell.

378
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,600
What else do you want?

379
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,520
-The future is yours.
-That's so filmy.

380
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,240
Straight from a film poster.

381
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,280
Or a political campaign.
Kinda like, "Yes, we can."

382
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,320
The future is yours.

383
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,040
The future is ours.

384
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,120
Should it be our slogan?

385
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,760
-Are you always working?
-As you are.

386
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:29,800
You just made me laugh
on a night like this.

387
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,320
It's my only real talent.

388
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,960
Mama?

389
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,440
Mama?

390
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,760
Where were you?

391
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,880
I just needed some time to think.
Get my head straight.

392
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,960
And?

393
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,760
I'm here.

394
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,440
I'm not going anywhere.

395
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,240
And I'm gonna move in
at the end of the month. Good?

396
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,080
Interior: <i>NLS canteen, day.</i>

397
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,440
<i>There she was in her bright fuchsia dress,</i>

398
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,480
<i>a smile as wide
as the earth's circumference.</i>

399
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,040
<i>She pours chilly chutney
on her idly liberally.</i>

400
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,200
<i>This girl likes things hot.</i>

401
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,520
<i>She takes a bite,
tears stream down her face.</i>

402
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,520
<i>She gulps down water.
Laughs at her own stupidity.</i>

403
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:22,960
Again, again.

404
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,200
<i>Tarun only has eyes for Sanjana.</i>

405
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,240
<i>He can't help it.</i>

406
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,920
Tarun:

407
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,640
<i>Maybe this is my destiny.</i>

408
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,120
<i>Bengaluru and Sanjana.</i>

409
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,800
<i>Sanjana and Bengaluru.</i>

410
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,640
-You know you can leave.
-I'll keep you company.

411
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,720
To handle the vandals.

412
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,280
By the way, what did they write?

413
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,000
"Cunty dyke"?

414
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,600
Such atrocious vocabulary.

415
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,040
What would you have written?

416
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,040
I don't know. Wiccan witch.

417
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,200
Please. These cuss words on you
just sound wrong, man.

418
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,960
They are supposed to sound wrong,
dumb fuck.

419
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:17,400
-What? What was that?
-What would you write for me?

420
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,760
Like... Junkie addict.

421
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,160
Junkie, dopehead, crackhead number one.

422
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:31,440
Now my only number one is mushrooms.
But in an omelet.

423
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,240
For me, it's my mom's stuffed bread.

424
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,080
Yeah, right and family.

425
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,600
Family equals distance.

426
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,400
-Friends?
-Life.

427
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,640
-Love?
-Need.

428
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,240
Bloody asshole!

429
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,840
I loved her, okay? I loved her.

430
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,720
And love is not wrong!

431
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,880
-Why don't you get it?
-Umang, stop!

432
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,880
Stop.

433
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,920
Hey.

434
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,360
-Hey!
-Let him go.

435
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,120
-Umang.
-Hi.

436
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,440
Just in time.

437
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,040
Want a croissant? Fresh from the oven.

438
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,760
Meher, can we please talk?

439
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,120
Sure. But try this.

440
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,840
It's perfect.

441
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,560
-Thank you.
-Just like you.

442
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,520
Meher...

443
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,080
You know, I feel really fortunate
to have met you,

444
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,960
and whoever you date will be a lucky girl.

445
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,520
Wait a minute.

446
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,880
Not you?

447
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,720
Meher, I just feel...

448
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,120
Are you breaking it off with me?

449
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,160
-Meher, please just...
-Yes or no?

450
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:41,080
Meher... Meher, please try to understand.

451
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:45,240
My wedding with Samara
did not get canceled. I broke it off.

452
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,720
-I just need some time. I...
-Umang.

453
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,480
-Can you please leave?
-Meher, can you just...

454
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,960
Just leave.

455
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,840
Okay.

456
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,120
