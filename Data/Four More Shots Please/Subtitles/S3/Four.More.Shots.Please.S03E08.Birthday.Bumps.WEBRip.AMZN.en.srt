1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,840
<i>Birthdays are so overrated.</i>

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,080
<i>What are we even celebrating here?</i>

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,520
<i>That we are growing up.</i>

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,920
<i>And the world's waiting
for us to arrive.</i>

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,160
Birthday Bumps.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,160
<i>I'm turning 25,</i>

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,720
<i>and I feel like the world around me
is crashing and burning.</i>

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,600
<i>The question is,
"Can I walk through that fire?</i>

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,200
<i>"Will I make it through
to the other side?"</i>

10
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,400
-How are you?
-Good.

11
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,560
-Quite a place.
-Yeah.

12
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,200
Hi.

13
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,080
Your dad and I
always wanted to come here together.

14
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,160
Hi, how are you? Varun!

15
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,080
But now we're here with Rajan. Right?

16
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,360
Come.

17
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,120
Hello, ladies and gentlemen!

18
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,840
And the beautiful little girl.

19
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,600
Let's begin the treasure hunt.

20
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,880
-All right!
-Yes!

21
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,080
When I blow the whistle, everyone go
and collect all the tiaras you can.

22
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,120
What's the prize?

23
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,280
-Here's the prize.
-Hi, everyone!

24
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,400
Hey!

25
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,320
Hey!

26
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,960
Good to see you.

27
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,360
<i>-Ciao,</i> man. How are you?
-How are you?

28
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,760
Excuse me.

29
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,400
Partner selection time.

30
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,560
-Go!
-Yes!

31
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,160
Okay.

32
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,880
Rajan.

33
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,520
Sneha.

34
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,920
Mihir.

35
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,000
Sean.

36
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,680
You and I lost in Italy.

37
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,920
JEH

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,400
You were always the one.

39
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,080
-Damini was just an excuse?
-Yes.

40
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,880
And the treasure hunt starts now.
Grab your partner, basket, and cycle.

41
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,080
-Hey, Mihir, good luck.
-You too, uncle.

42
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,760
So you and my mom are friends?

43
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,520
Yup.

44
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,200
And what else?

45
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,920
Well, I'm very fond of your mother.

46
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,400
And the feeling is mutual.

47
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,120
We like each other's company.

48
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,480
How long has it been since your wife died?

49
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,440
Five years.

50
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,120
Yeah. Well, it hasn't been
that long for my mom.

51
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,600
I know that.

52
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,880
She needs time on her own.

53
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,200
To be alone or to be lonely?

54
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,800
There's a difference.

55
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,480
Look. She's vulnerable right now,
and I need to protect her.

56
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,120
I wouldn't expect any less.

57
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,360
I'm trying, Siddhi.

58
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,360
Could you also please try?

59
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,160
Sean?

60
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,440
You're really into her, aren't you?

61
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,400
Who?

62
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,880
Yeah.

63
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,880
-So tell her.
-Isn't she into women?

64
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:44,920
Umang falls in love with a person
and doesn't really care about gender.

65
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,760
But if she rejects you, it's not personal.

66
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,400
Sometimes two people

67
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,240
are right for each other,

68
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,960
but they can't make it work.

69
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,840
Right?

70
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,680
Let's get some tiaras.

71
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,280
I found one!

72
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,960
I found one, too!

73
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,280
All right! We are crushing this.
Let's look for more.

74
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,640
Go, go!

75
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,000
So, congrats! Moving in and all.

76
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,880
Yeah... That happened.

77
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,560
Wow, so much enthusiasm!

78
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,720
Was I ready?

79
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,000
I don't know. Any advice?

80
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,840
Boss, you're just moving in, right?
What advice do you want?

81
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:57,040
I got married, had kids, everything.
Without being ready.

82
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,640
Twice.

83
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,400
And now, I think the second one
will end in divorce too.

84
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,560
So yeah, man!
I'm the king of fucking things up!

85
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,200
Wait. You think I'm fucking it up
for myself?

86
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,640
Nah, man! You're a martyr.

87
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,160
You'd die for love
without so much as a whimper.

88
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,680
A martyr? Me?

89
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,640
Yeah, because you just told me
that you got forced into moving in.

90
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,760
-I wasn't forced.
-No?

91
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,640
I was bulldozed.

92
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,000
Wow. That's the harshest thing
I've ever heard coming out of your mouth.

93
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,120
Well, I'm learning from the best.

94
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,800
Me?

95
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,360
Her.

96
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,480
Umang?

97
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,520
You okay?

98
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:24,160
Mihir, has it ever happened to you
that someone loves you madly

99
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,240
but you just don't feel the same?

100
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,280
Nope.

101
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,600
The other way around.

102
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,880
To unrequited love.

103
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,200
That's a 20-year vintage Sangiovese.

104
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,760
Sanju who?

105
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,280
Bro, the poor thing has been
neglected for 20 years.

106
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,840
He needs our love!

107
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,240
The guest list is top brass, Dhananjay.
I got confirmations from everyone.

108
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,520
-Okay, stay in touch. Really excited.
-Dee?

109
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,160
Can't you go a day without work?

110
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,480
I also left my work behind.
It's only fair.

111
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,400
Phones off.

112
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,880
Fine.

113
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,360
Okay.

114
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,440
Damini, is this really so hard for you?

115
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,640
You wanted me to move in.

116
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,480
But since I moved in,
I don't know why you're unhappy.

117
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,760
I mean, you're in your own world
and I'm pulling you away from it.

118
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,400
Because no matter how hard I try, somehow,

119
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,760
I just don't fit in.

120
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,640
Not with you, not in your world.

121
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,280
Not with us.

122
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,200
Not in our world.

123
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,120
Jeh, you're overthinking this.

124
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,760
Really.

125
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,120
-Sangiovese!
-Sangiovese!

126
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,000
As long as I have.

127
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,200
1920!

128
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,640
This place...

129
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,480
Anjana,

130
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,720
can I ask you something?

131
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,080
Yeah, of course.

132
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,400
How did you learn to be single again?

133
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,360
It's been so long.

134
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,280
I don't even know who I am without him.

135
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,760
You know, Sneha, in my case,

136
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,800
I chose to be single, right?

137
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,080
You didn't.

138
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,080
It's different.

139
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,080
Yeah, I know. It is different.

140
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,920
It takes time.

141
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,440
But maybe you should

142
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,160
take time to find yourself again.

143
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,440
Dada, I found that one.

144
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,200
-We're on the same team.
-Arya!

145
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,400
-No!
-Just put it in...

146
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,160
Arya, Varun, what's going on?

147
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,480
Damn it! Tiaras!

148
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,000
Why can't we all stay single?

149
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,080
Do we even need relationships?

150
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,800
So many expectations.

151
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,360
And even more disappointment.
I mean, look at me.

152
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,600
Samara. Meher. Pinky.

153
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,520
Before them, no problem.

154
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,120
Only happy.

155
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,640
And now, so many explanations!

156
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,320
But who needs explanations?

157
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,560
Everybody!

158
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,920
Speaking as an experienced jilted lover...

159
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,000
Siddhi explained twice
why she can't be with me.

160
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,400
But I still don't get it.

161
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,480
Maybe because I don't want to?

162
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,680
You want them to want to be with you.

163
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,640
And those are the only words
that'll ever work.

164
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,280
There's never any closure.

165
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,160
Is that why you're here?

166
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,640
Because I saw her stand-up.

167
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,480
And you saw how fucked up she is.

168
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,000
And because she asked me to come.

169
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,000
If there's any meaning in that...

170
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,880
I don't want to let that hope go.

171
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,040
Hey!

172
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,480
How are you?

173
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,400
Are you a masochist?

174
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,640
Yeah.

175
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,000
Why do you always act like a do-gooder?

176
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,000
-Don't you get tired?
-That's it?

177
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,440
Troll me a little more.

178
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,640
-You can do better.
-What does that mean?

179
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,000
Well, you're a comic.

180
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,840
An angry comic, apparently.

181
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,400
-So roast me.
-I could seriously punch you right now.

182
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,600
Then maybe I'll get a reaction from you.

183
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,400
You just stand there, listening.

184
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,200
Don't you ever get angry?

185
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,200
Just say something back to me!

186
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,560
Why do you love torturing yourself?

187
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,880
Because I still love you.

188
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,440
Love makes your brain stop working.

189
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,520
Just fuck off!

190
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,840
Shit!

191
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,200
You break my heart and my bones too?

192
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,600
<i>Everything okay?</i>

193
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,800
If Viju were here, he would've seen
his little girl become a woman.

194
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,400
Where did my life go?

195
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,040
Nowhere.

196
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,320
What's gone

197
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,200
is a story.

198
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,640
Your life is here.

199
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,600
Right here, right now.

200
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,640
There are so many memories, Rajan.

201
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,520
And wishes?

202
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,200
You have much to live for, Sneha.

203
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,960
Your story isn't over yet.

204
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,360
Mom?

205
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,920
Got you!

206
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,520
What?

207
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,960
Perfect.

208
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,680
Like the queen that you are.

209
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,800
Was that a pick-up line?

210
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,200
That's my life, man.

211
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,960
Using lines, writing lines.

212
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,800
Plus, I won you over with my words.

213
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,840
-Did you now?
-You know I did.

214
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,200
-Dada!
-Yeah?

215
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,200
I found one!

216
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,400
We're winning this. We're winning!
Come! Quick, my dear.

217
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,040
<i>And the winners are...</i>

218
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,760
Varun and Jeh!

219
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,880
And me!

220
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,200
-The little girl!
-The little girl!

221
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,400
Thank you.

222
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,560
-Where's Siddhi?
-Isn't she with you?

223
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,280
Look here. There you go. Got it!

224
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,200
Thank you. All right!

225
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,160
Nice.

226
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,560
Drunk yoga.

227
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,920
Are you...

228
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,880
-What's up?
-Meher.

229
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,840
I understand where she's coming from.

230
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,000
It's hard

231
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,840
getting over you.

232
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,320
Meaning?

233
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm crazy about you, Umang.

234
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,320
You're crazy!

235
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,080
You're just... Bro, are you nuts?

236
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,560
About you.

237
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,480
-You're crazy!
-About...

238
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,680
You're drunk!

239
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,320
Not at all.

240
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,320
Thanks for fucking up my head even more.

241
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,080
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

242
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,880
I'm sorry. I don't know
what came over me. I...

243
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,720
It's okay. I have narrow ear canals.

244
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,000
It affects me.

245
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,560
-You're wrong.
-Hey!

246
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,960
-An ENT diagnosed it.
-About still loving me.

247
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,040
You barely know me, Mihir.

248
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,160
What do you mean?

249
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,040
I've known you since childhood.

250
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,440
We aren't kids anymore!

251
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,520
You don't know this me.

252
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,240
Jeh.

253
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,720
Here.

254
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,200
Come.

255
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,560
It's okay. It's okay. Jeh.

256
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,440
The bed is right there, baba.

257
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,000
Wait, I'll get some water.

258
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,560
The only person I ever loved.

259
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,760
Jeh.

260
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,320
Maybe you don't love me anymore.

261
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,080
When did I say that?

262
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,560
You said nothing.

263
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,760
I'm left guessing.

264
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,720
Do you not see me, Damini?

265
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,800
Or am I not good enough for you?

266
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,440
Because you're a great intellectual,

267
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,400
and I'm a mere bartender.

268
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,800
I'm just a fucking bartender.

269
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,480
I'm just a fucking bartender.

270
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,320
<i>Happy birthday, Sids!</i>

271
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,800
<i>Happy birthday, Siddhi!</i>

272
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,560
Oh, shit!

273
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,560
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

274
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,160
This place is unbelievable.

275
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,320
You also cheer up, Sulk Smitha.

276
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,200
Sure.

277
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,000
In other news,
Sean says that he's crazy about me.

278
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,040
So?

279
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,760
I told him,
Italy is bringing out his inner Romeo.

280
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,480
Wow. And I thought I was rude.

281
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,080
How do you feel about him?

282
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,680
I don't know.

283
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,280
I mean,

284
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,440
he's a good guy.
Honest. And fit, too. But...

285
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,200
-But?
-I mean,

286
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,560
there's definitely something
I like about him.

287
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,280
But with men, it's like,

288
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,680
I've never had a meaningful relationship
with them outside of sex.

289
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,040
I don't know if I can be
in a relationship with a man, so...

290
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,880
But, Mangs, I think that's fine.

291
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,080
Sean is a close friend, not your lover.

292
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,160
And I guess that's why the confusion.

293
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,600
Just imagine being stuck with dick
for the rest of your life.

294
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,520
-Actually...
-What?

295
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:04,160
I don't mind being stuck with dick
for the rest of my life.

296
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:05,960
Of course.

297
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,960
Yeah! Cheers to that.
Where's your drink?

298
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,320
Hey, don't take mine.

299
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,200
Salud!

300
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,440
Hi!

301
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,400
Wow, amazing. How fantastic is this?

302
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,440
Partner!

303
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,360
Cheers!

304
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,160
-Eat!
-Yes.

305
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,440
-Want a top-up?
-Please.

306
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,880
Umang, do you want a top-up?

307
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,200
Everyone! Everyone!

308
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,000
Everyone!

309
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,560
It's my birthday, guys!

310
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,040
-Yeah!
-Yes, it is!

311
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,560
Okay, okay. Speech.

312
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,840
So, thank you all for coming out.

313
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,280
Really.

314
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,680
Okay, I know that for the last few days,
I've been a bit of a sulk-pot, but...

315
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,520
you guys are the best!

316
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,680
Okay, I promise
that from now on, I'll try my best

317
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,880
to be that cute,
bubbly, cuddly Siddhi again.

318
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,960
Sounds good to me.

319
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,640
Because, you guys,
we're in the country of love!

320
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,120
Love, yeah!

321
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,920
So, to...

322
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,520
To all the lovely couples out here,

323
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,160
Dee, Jeh?

324
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,200
You both look so hot.

325
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,200
What's wrong?

326
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,120
Why do you look so awkward?

327
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,120
-Not really.
-Shit. Still not doing it?

328
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,880
Okay, my Anj and Aru.

329
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,600
Hi! So cute!

330
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,880
Hey, what about me?

331
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,280
You're married.
Did you forget Kavya?

332
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:33,000
Anj, seriously. You have got
to stop snogging married men.

333
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,560
Siddhi, can you stop?

334
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,720
Mangs, I didn't forget you.

335
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,080
Mangs and Sean.

336
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,880
Guys! There are so many rooms here,
just go for it!

337
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,480
Siddhi, that's enough.

338
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,400
That's enough, darling.

339
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,920
Mom and your non-boyfriend.

340
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,400
That advice was not for you guys. Okay?

341
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,960
Just putting it out there.

342
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,120
And, Mihir.

343
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,560
My Mihu-Pihu.

344
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,800
No luck this time, buddy. Again!

345
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,400
Next time, let's try again
at an even more exotic location. Okay?

346
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,320
I promise.

347
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,640
So, a very happy birthday to me!

348
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,480
Happy birthday to you.

349
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,560
Yeah!

350
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,600
You really gotta get laid, man.

351
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,800
You need to get out of Anj's house, man.

352
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,360
I am happy where I am.

353
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,360
If you're doling out advice,
give some to Jeh.

354
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,680
He's the one
who got bulldozed into moving in.

355
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,960
-Varun.
-Excuse me?

356
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,520
Bro?

357
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,560
At least I'm not looking
for handouts from my partners.

358
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,880
What exactly have you achieved
in your life, anyway?

359
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,280
I made two smart, beautiful kids.

360
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,160
I swear!

361
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,640
My sperm is of the highest quality.

362
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,640
-I mean...
-It should be studied.

363
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,080
Speaking of kids,

364
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:12,200
Sids, you and Mihir
would make beautiful children.

365
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,680
But you're still a child,
so that'll never happen.

366
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,920
Go away, man!
Just go screw Sean. Go!

367
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,920
"Bubbly" is rude!

368
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,640
-Any problem?
-Yes, I do.

369
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,680
What? No more marriages to wreck?

370
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,040
Now it's a party, guys!
Yeah, let's go!

371
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,360
Happy birthday to me!

372
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,760
<i>Bellissima, bellissima</i>

373
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:51,040
<i>You and me together make happiness</i>

374
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,200
<i>Hey, friends</i>

375
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,080
<i>Hello, amore</i>

376
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,600
<i>Greetings</i>

377
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:01,240
<i>I've been waiting for you
all my life, amore</i>

378
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,560
<i>Come hold my hand
and take me high, let's go fly</i>

379
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:09,160
<i>There's something about you
that makes me go crazy</i>

380
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,320
<i>When you move your hips,
my gosh!</i>

381
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,360
You're right.

382
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,000
I know the childhood Siddhi.

383
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,480
I know you even today.

384
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,960
You bake the best red velvet cupcakes.

385
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:32,920
I know you'd do anything for your friends.
And by anything, I mean anything.

386
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,600
I know that you hide your vulnerability
behind your weird dark humor.

387
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,040
You're more instinctive
and introspective than you think.

388
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,680
I know that you're beautiful.
Inside and out.

389
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,800
And I know that
you're hurting inside right now because

390
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,560
you think life forced you
to suddenly grow up one day.

391
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,320
But I do know something else, too.

392
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,280
I know that growing up

393
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,480
comes with loss and pain
and sadness and heartache.

394
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,880
But it also comes with hope...

395
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,640
and love.

396
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,160
Cake! It's cake time! It's cake time!

397
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,280
Wow!

398
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,040
-Cake fight!
-No, no!

399
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,680
-This your room?
-That's it.

400
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,000
-Let me.
-Sorry...

401
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,520
Sids, let me...

402
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,360
Let me try. Let me.

403
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,560
Let me try.

404
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,120
I'm a bad person, right?

405
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,360
Nonsense.

406
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,440
Even more so with you.

407
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,240
For now.

408
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,280
You weren't always like this.

409
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,920
Mihir, please don't leave me, okay?

410
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,120
I just want to...

411
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,520
Varun, I'm really sorry
about what Siddhi said.

412
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,000
I don't think like that about you and...

413
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,600
-you should know that.
-Anj.

414
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,040
You don't owe me any explanations.

415
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,480
It's me.

416
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,440
And it's you.

417
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:15,960
Yeah.

418
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,920
And it's us.

419
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,040
Should I not have dropped that truth bomb?

420
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,440
No, it's...

421
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,560
You have the right
to express how you feel.

422
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,680
And you can feel awkward.

423
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,840
I'm not being awkward.

424
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,280
Then why are you avoiding me?

425
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,680
I'm not avoiding you.

426
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,200
You're kissing me back.

427
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,160
What are you thinking?

428
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,640
Sorry if I bulldozed you into moving in.

429
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,640
Damini?

430
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,040
You think you can do this with me?

431
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,360
Forever?

432
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,000
We should get married.

433
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,440
What?

434
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,160
Jeh...

435
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,560
I...

436
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,560
Just forget it.

437
