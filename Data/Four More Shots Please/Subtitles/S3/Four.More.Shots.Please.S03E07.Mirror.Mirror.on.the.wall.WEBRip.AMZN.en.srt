1
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,160
<i>Mirror, mirror on the wall,
how long do I stay strongest of them all?</i>

2
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,160
<i>Can I even take more of this?
Will I break down and never achieve bliss?</i>

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,160
<i>Why is life so hard?</i>

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,280
<i>Why do I always have to be on my guard?</i>

5
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,840
You have a lot of stuff.

6
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,600
Well, it is my whole apartment.

7
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,840
Meet Mister Beanie.

8
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,280
I've had him since college.

9
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,680
Your choice is very...

10
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,160
eclectic.

11
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,760
Thanks, Dee.

12
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,880
Arya, finish your milk. We have to leave.

13
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,800
I got it.

14
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,800
-Varun Khanna?
-Yes.

15
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,840
That's for you.

16
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,960
What is it?

17
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,240
It's from Kavya.

18
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,160
She wants a...

19
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,160
divorce.

20
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,880
Kavs, you didn't even give me a chance.

21
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,120
I mean, not even a conversation?

22
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,080
One mistake and you want a divorce now?

23
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,840
<i>I can't get through to you, Kavs.</i>

24
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,000
Please, just call me back.

25
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,960
You're a selfish person.

26
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,400
That's you.

27
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,800
Selfish.

28
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,200
I'm so sorry, Meher.

29
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,400
No, you're not sorry.

30
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,680
You don't even care.

31
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,600
You knew I was vulnerable.

32
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,200
I was looking for something meaningful.

33
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,360
You still strung me along.

34
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,880
You used me, Umang.

35
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,120
Please believe me,
I had no intention to hurt you.

36
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,680
-It was going so fast...
-Was it my fault?

37
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,240
It was our fault.

38
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,200
Wow.

39
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,440
You're a child.

40
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,040
I should've known better.

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,960
Just one thing.

42
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,640
Don't use people
to fill the void in your life

43
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,560
and discard them once you're okay again.

44
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,240
I was not your therapy, Umang.

45
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,440
Your detox getaway.

46
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,280
I'm such a fool.

47
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,720
Why can't I see a red flag? Why?

48
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,200
She was carrying a red flag on her head.
It's a complicated situation.

49
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,440
Why do I... Just... I need to stop. What?

50
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,520
-If you wanna talk...
-That's what I'm doing!

51
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,640
You are swearing in Punjabi.

52
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,560
Confucius said,

53
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,080
"If you can remain patient

54
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,520
in one moment of anger,

55
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,160
you will avoid
one hundred days of sorrow."

56
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,480
That'll be 299 for the year, please.
It's a promotional offer.

57
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,880
I hate being wrong.

58
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,440
We're human beings.

59
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,680
We usually spend our lives
moving from one mistake to the next.

60
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,600
I knew Meher
was looking for a relationship.

61
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,320
And still, I just couldn't stop myself.

62
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,360
What are you looking for?

63
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,480
I don't know, man. Freedom from myself,

64
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,240
from my innate ability
to just ruin everything.

65
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,240
Most people don't even realize
that they have a problem.

66
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,920
At least you took the first step.

67
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,640
Now that you know
you ruined things for yourself...

68
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,240
-don't do it anymore?
-That simple?

69
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,760
It's not that hard.

70
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,480
Hey, you've already started.

71
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,160
This studio is a beginning.

72
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,120
Was that a smile?

73
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,480
-Dee?
-Hi.

74
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,400
I'll settle everything soon.

75
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,880
Don't worry, I promise.

76
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,560
I'm not worried.

77
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,840
I know this is your apartment
and you're very particular.

78
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,040
I'll adjust.

79
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,280
Why? Because I can't?

80
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,800
-Who said that?
-You said I'm "particular."

81
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,840
It means fixed.
Everything should be in its place.

82
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,840
You mean rigid. Stubborn.

83
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,240
Inflexible, intractable, unyielding.

84
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,520
I don't know,

85
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,160
but I'm gonna have to get a thesaurus.

86
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,360
-Okay, listen.
-What?

87
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,200
Mister Beanie has to go.

88
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,360
<i>Forget about divorce.
You're getting depressed.</i>

89
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,080
<i>No, no.That is not making me depressed.</i>

90
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,520
<i>-Your bad jokes are making me depressed.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

91
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,600
Shall we remove clause 22?

92
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,720
It could work.

93
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,520
What?

94
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,760
I just remembered a night like this one.

95
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,400
Except, we weren't in the office.

96
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,200
That was a different time, Shashank.

97
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,120
Do you think about it?

98
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,160
Do you ever... want it back?

99
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,960
We were so good together, Anj.

100
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,680
We can still be.

101
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,040
I'm...

102
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm...

103
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,320
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, Anjana.

104
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,400
Anj...

105
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,000
-Fuck!
-Shashank!

106
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,480
Shashank, I like working with you.
That's it!

107
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,760
I hope you don't think I'm leading you on.

108
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,280
What's wrong with me.

109
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,760
I'm just...

110
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,880
I'm sorry.

111
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,120
Fuck, I'm sorry.

112
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,600
Is something hurting?

113
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,840
Everything is hurting.

114
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,960
I'm sorry.

115
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,760
{\an8}I told you.

116
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,200
We all told you we don't trust him.

117
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,360
Forget him, Mangs. He's finally got it.

118
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,640
And honestly, it's...

119
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,320
not even about Shashank.
He's not the problem.

120
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,640
-Can I confess something?
-Of course.

121
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,640
When Kavya sent those divorce papers,

122
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,840
I actually felt happy.

123
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,480
I know, Mangs,
what you all think about Varun.

124
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,880
Dude, that doesn't matter at all.
Speak from your heart, what do you want?

125
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,840
I'm confused.

126
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,840
-After that kiss, did you guys...
-No, nothing.

127
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,760
Do you want something to happen?

128
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,840
I don't know.

129
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,720
-What does Varun want?
-I don't know.

130
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,880
Okay.

131
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,880
-Oh, God.
-It's okay!

132
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,280
It's okay. Just take it one day at a time.

133
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,640
That much, I can do.

134
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,000
<i>Am I deaf?</i>

135
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,480
Okay, fine. Bye.

136
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,520
Ditchers.

137
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,200
Fries not good?

138
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,600
I was gonna order,
but life's too short for bad fries.

139
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,520
Have these. I barely touched them.

140
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,640
Not true. You've had two.

141
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,520
You're watching me?

142
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,440
Yes! And eavesdropping, too.

143
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,200
Friends ditched you. So did mine.

144
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,080
It doesn't mean I need new friends.

145
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,360
No, you should never make friends.

146
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,520
Friendship is nothing but a sinking ship.

147
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,600
Okay. Let me guess. You took a course
in creative writing in the US.

148
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,760
You were a top student,
but you haven't written a book yet.

149
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,880
You're right about the book.
But I stood last in my class.

150
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,720
My friends did better
and they think they're better.

151
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,160
-Right?
-Yeah.

152
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,760
Like, "We're so busy. We have real jobs.

153
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,120
"We don't have time to hang out with you."

154
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,680
Yeah. Like,
how can you enjoy gin and tonic

155
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,320
when democracy is under threat?
How shallow.

156
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,680
I'm Dhruv.

157
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,080
-Siddhi.
-Siddhi.

158
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,600
What do you do?

159
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,680
Mostly nothing. Spend my family's money.

160
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,040
Same here. High-five.

161
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,440
-Nice.
-Guys.

162
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,440
-All good?
-Of course.

163
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,000
Bodyguard?

164
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,960
I don't need a bodyguard.
I can take care of myself.

165
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,280
Wanna play pool?

166
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,400
-Sure.
-Let's go.

167
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,720
After you.

168
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,320
"Clearly, Dhananjay Deshpande
hasn't inherited

169
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,360
his father's conservative genes."

170
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,800
I do look like my mother.

171
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,160
"It's taken one lone voice of dissent

172
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,920
to take down a bastion
of divisive politics.

173
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,960
"As Dhananjay heralds
a new era for the party,

174
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,320
his father Yogendra Deshpande

175
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,880
seems to have been
marginalized and outmaneuvered."

176
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,880
You don't know him. You should be careful.

177
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,360
Relax, Dad. I can take care of myself.

178
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,760
Siddhi, go home, alone.

179
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,320
I'm already alone.

180
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,240
-Ice?
-Yes, please.

181
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,840
Everyone wanted Chiranjeev Sule
to be the party vice president.

182
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,280
But I appealed
to the party workers for you.

183
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,960
Then have some faith in me, too.

184
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,520
I want to take the party into the new era.

185
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,120
By bulldozing its values?

186
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:04,280
Dad, it was you who said
I'm the new face of the party.

187
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,880
Well, you gave the party
a complete makeover.

188
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,000
Mr. Deshpande, sorry to interrupt.

189
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,840
The polls say that Dhananjay's popularity
is increasing every day.

190
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,240
Did anyone ask you?

191
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,400
This is between father and son.
You better stay out of it!

192
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,120
Why are you yelling at Damini?
I'm responsible for what I did.

193
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,840
But she provoked you!

194
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,240
Think about it once again, Dhananjay.

195
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,240
What you have set out to do
is not just a mistake,

196
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,080
it's career suicide.

197
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,720
Get the car.

198
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,080
-Why aren't you picking up?
-I'm in the middle of something, Jeh.

199
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,440
Siddhi is not okay.
She's making out with a random guy.

200
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,240
She'll have some great sex.

201
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,120
Have you spoken to her lately?

202
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,920
-She needs you guys.
-Hang on.

203
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,880
Are you telling me
how to behave with my friends?

204
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,800
<i>It's time Siddhi learns
to take care of her shit.</i>

205
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,800
I'm at work. I've gotta go. Okay?

206
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,720
<i>Bye.</i>

207
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,520
-You wanna go back to my place?
-Yes.

208
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,640
Anywhere but mine.

209
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,200
I think your father has a point.

210
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,440
You are saying this?

211
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,440
I don't want my ideals
to damage your career.

212
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,600
You're too important for that.

213
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,120
-You really think that?
-Idealism has ruined so many people.

214
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,920
No. You think I'm important?

215
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Yes, I do.

216
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,160
Damini, I'm thinking
about quitting the party.

217
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,360
What?

218
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,480
I'll contest this election
as an independent candidate.

219
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,640
Without the party's mass base...

220
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,000
-Do you believe in me?
-Of course, I do.

221
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,360
And I believe in you.

222
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:26,280
So let's do this. If we lose, we lose.
But let's give it a try at least?

223
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,520
We...

224
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,760
We can do this.

225
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,400
-Let's go up.
-Yeah, let's go.

226
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,520
Yeah.

227
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,280
Thank you.

228
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,080
Oh, no, no. Here.

229
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,280
Whenever I have a beer with a guy,

230
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:39,080
whom I really like,
it always ends up being a problem.

231
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,920
So, you like me?

232
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,760
There it goes.

233
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,080
You are my friend now.

234
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,800
Great.

235
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,400
It's an honor.

236
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,800
I made a new friend after a long time.

237
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,320
I'll make a note in my diary.

238
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,640
There you go.

239
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,040
Thank you.

240
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,040
You smell delicious.

241
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,520
Thanks.

242
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,040
Come.

243
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,320
Slow... Slow down.

244
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,280
I love big girls. They're so slutty.

245
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,400
Call me Big Boy, you little slut.

246
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,560
I'm not... Dhruv...

247
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,560
I'm not... Dhruv, I'm not comfortable.

248
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,440
Got me all excited.

249
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,920
No, Dhruv. I'm not comfortable.

250
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,400
You got me all excited, skanky little ho.

251
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,320
Blow me.

252
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,000
-Blow me, you bitch.
-No.

253
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,560
-Blow me, you little slut.
-Please!

254
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,760
Blow me.

255
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,440
Dhruv, back off!

256
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,880
Back the fuck off, man!

257
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,520
I'm leaving.

258
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,800
Hey, what happened?

259
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,800
We were having fun. Relax, babe.

260
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,440
No, you were. I wasn't. I'm out of here.

261
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,320
Excuse me?

262
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,080
You can't leave like this.

263
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,800
-Leave my hand.
-You flirted all evening,

264
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,320
-and now wanna go?
-Let go!

265
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,880
Leaving me with this boner. You can't go.

266
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,000
-You can't.
-I can do whatever I want.

267
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,160
Stop playing me. You came here
after knowing me for a couple of hours.

268
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,080
You're a fucking slut.
A real fucking slut.

269
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,000
Fuck!

270
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,160
Fuck, bitch!

271
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,680
Fucking bitch!

272
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,800
Ma'am!

273
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,920
You bitch! My car!

274
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,120
Fuck, I'll call the cops.

275
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,480
Call them. I dare you!

276
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,160
Do you know what consent is?

277
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:05,240
I told you, "Back off.
I'm not comfortable."

278
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,600
But you didn't hear!

279
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,400
Can you hear me now?

280
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,520
"Bitch." "Slut." "Whore."

281
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,240
They label girls the minute they see them.

282
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:11,160
Remember how we were screaming "vagina"
right here the other day?

283
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,600
Thinking we own it all.

284
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,000
But we don't, do we?

285
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,040
Will you be okay?

286
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,200
I'm fine.

287
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,160
Thanks.

288
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,760
How are you feeling, Siddhi?

289
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,800
Amazing.

290
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,000
You know you can tell me anything, right?

291
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,960
It's your 25th birthday next month.

292
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,680
We could do something special.

293
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,680
We could go away together to celebrate.

294
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,840
Somewhere amazing,

295
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,000
like Italy.

296
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,440
Italy?

297
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,120
Italy, with vineyards
and villas and old castles.

298
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,760
-Let's do this together.
-Just you and me?

299
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:02,520
And Umang and Damini and Anjana
and anyone else you want there.

300
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,680
Rajan knows the owners of Villa Bianca.

301
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:12,080
He says it's a gorgeous, secluded place.
It's lovely. You'll love it!

302
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,560
Rajan.

303
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,640
So he'll come along?

304
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,920
Siddhi, he's helping me
arrange everything.

305
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,920
It would be odd not to invite him.

306
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,360
So, you're not asking me,
you're telling me.

307
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,960
I wanna do something special
for your birthday.

308
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,400
And I don't wanna celebrate my birthday.

309
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,400
Siddhi, Viju wanted to do
something special for your birthday.

310
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,480
Like you care.

311
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,240
Sneha planned
Siddhi's birthday celebration in Italy.

312
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,640
I just hope everything goes well.

313
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,240
-Of course it'll go well.
-You never know.

314
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,280
This year's been so fucked up.

315
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,880
However,

316
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,640
I have some good news.

317
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,720
Which is?

318
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,880
-Have you heard of Rage Studios?
-Yes?

319
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,680
They've agreed to produce
my directorial debut.

320
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,680
Really?

321
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,800
Yeah.

322
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,120
Oh, my God!

323
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,400
Oh, my God!

324
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,560
So, tell me, what's the name of the film?
Who's in it?

325
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,400
It's called <i>The Incomplete Us.</i>

326
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,680
-We're talking to Arhan Khurana.
-I like him.

327
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,840
And the story is about me, you...

328
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,040
and Kavya.

329
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,080
-Nice.
-Yes.

330
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,720
At least you can benefit
from our boring sad life.

331
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,120
Hey, man, we're neither boring, nor sad.

332
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,800
In the words of the Rage Studio executive,

333
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:46,120
"We're full of pathos, emotion,
comedy, tragedy and true love."

334
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,960
So, me or Kavya?

335
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,240
Don't answer that. I'm just kidding.

336
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,160
We should celebrate this in Italy.

337
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,800
In fact, Sneha has invited you.

338
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,520
So would you like to join me and Arya?

339
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,240
Well, that depends, Anj.
As a babysitter or a plus one?

340
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,400
Depends on which option you prefer.

341
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,400
Actually I'm game for both.
It's not like I have a life or friends.

342
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,800
Yeah, but you do have a family.

343
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,160
On the house.

344
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,360
Hi, Sids.

345
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,480
Hi! How are you?

346
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,080
To what do I owe the pleasure?

347
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,360
Well, pleasure is wherever Siddhi is.

348
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,480
Oh, what brings you here Mr. Gulzar?

349
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,480
Sids, best of luck.

350
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,480
Why are you suddenly so supportive?

351
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,160
Sids, we're trying.

352
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,600
Fine. Just don't try like my mom.

353
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,880
She has planned
this fancy-ass trip for my birthday

354
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,520
because Rajan has contacts.

355
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,400
Listen, when she calls to invite you guys,
just say no. All of...

356
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,240
She's already invited you guys
and you agreed.

357
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:03,320
Actually, her travel agent
has our documents, too.

358
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,120
Thanks for the betrayal, guys.

359
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,480
Sids, Sneha is really trying, okay?

360
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,480
She planned a great weekend for you.

361
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,680
How sweet. I'm so happy.

362
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,680
For Sneha, Rajan and all of you.

363
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,600
Now, I have a show to perform.

364
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:19,320
Considering what happened last time,
I can't fuck this one up.

365
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,280
All right, welcome back once again Siddhi!

366
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,240
-Hi!
-Go, Siddhi!

367
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:30,640
So, how many of you
have been called a slut at least once?

368
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,280
What a slutty audience, I must say.

369
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,200
I know slut jokes are really "whorible."

370
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,040
Okay, moving on from that.

371
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,160
So, for the uninitiated,

372
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,800
a slut is a woman
with the morals of a man.

373
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,520
Hence proved.
I'm Siddhi Patel and I am a slut.

374
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,440
Apparently, it doesn't take much
to qualify as a slut.

375
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,800
For example,
if you flirt with a guy at a bar,

376
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,600
it gives him the license
to call you a slut.

377
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:07,000
And, God forbid, if you're
one of those girls who have the superpower

378
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,760
to change her mind about the boy later on.

379
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,440
Well, you breached the contract.

380
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,800
The contract that if you laugh
at one of his jokes,

381
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,480
you give him a hand job.
Two jokes, blow job.

382
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,880
I mean, how dare you?

383
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:25,840
A boy is turned on by looking at you,
and you do nothing about it?

384
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,520
Slut!

385
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:32,960
So every time someone uses the S-word,
I just use the C-word.

386
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,800
Starts with a C, ends with a T...

387
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,600
-No one?
-No!

388
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,680
Consent.

389
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,880
Actually, you know
what the real problem is?

390
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,960
Girls grow up watching rom-coms
and boys, porn.

391
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,720
Honestly, I don't know
which is more dangerous.

392
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:59,240
That dream boy who stands
with his arms wide open in a mustard field

393
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:03,320
who is forever ready for romance.

394
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:08,120
Or that blow-up sex doll from Japan
who has a plastic smile on her face

395
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,360
while men call her a slut,
bitch, whore and choke her.

396
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,400
Both these stereotypes
ruin our romantic future.

397
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:19,200
And as a result, both the genders
don't know how to deal

398
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,240
with real flesh-and-blood
humans of the opposite sex.

399
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,520
Especially our Indian men,

400
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,760
who are obsessed with porn and moms.

401
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,760
They grow up with "my baby" syndrome,

402
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,760
and all they want is
that the girl stepping into his life

403
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,280
continues to validate it.

404
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,600
So, you know that guy at the bar
I went home with?

405
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,600
The one who called me
"a filthy bitch, slut, and whore"

406
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,160
because I refused to make out with him?

407
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,360
The one who forced me to go down on him?

408
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:55,000
Probably just wanted me
to stroke his little thing

409
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,320
and call him "my baby" while I did it.

410
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,360
Thank you, guys. That's my time.

411
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,680
Hi, Siddhi.

412
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:19,960
Hi.

413
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,920
I'm visiting Mom. I saw your post.
Thought I'd see you in action.

414
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,680
Hope you got your money's worth.

415
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,160
How's Mom?

416
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,160
Sneha? She's on a roll, dude.

417
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,440
She planned my birthday party
without even asking me.

418
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,920
In Italy, no less.

419
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,560
And imagine who she planned it with.
Rajan!

420
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,480
You know Rajan. Sneha's non-boyfriend?

421
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,440
You know Dad's dead?

422
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,520
And it took her two minutes to move on?

423
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,120
Anyway, join us if you want.

424
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,120
-Where?
-For my birthday bonanza!

425
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,640
-Me?
-Are you busy or getting married?

426
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,920
-No.
-What's the problem then?

427
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,080
Why are you feeling shy?
You came to Udaipur for Mang's wedding.

428
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,680
-It's okay. Seriously.
-No, seriously!

429
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,960
The way I dumped you, the least I could do
is give you a weekend of wine.

430
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:14,880
Please?

431
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,480
It's time to make amends!

432
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,520
Guys! I'm making amends. See!

433
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,160
-New me!
-Yeah, okay.

434
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,160
Great.

435
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,120
-Sean.
-Sean! Hi!

436
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,280
-Hi.
-Hi!

437
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,000
Hi. Here are the keys.

438
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,680
Anything else?

439
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,560
No. Could you give us a minute?

440
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,000
No, wait! Come, join us!

441
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,440
-You should come with us.
-Sorry. For what?

442
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,880
My 25th birthday. You haven't heard?

443
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,560
-Sean, just ignore her.
-No, don't ignore me.

444
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,640
I'm inviting you
to an all-expenses-paid trip to Italy!

445
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:56,520
You could be our "mental health coach."
God knows, we need one. Especially me.

446
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,640
-You don't know me.
-I don't know Rajan either.

447
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,560
I insist.

448
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,760
I should have at least two people
in my birthday guest list.

449
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,040
Sneha has invited the rest.

450
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,160
Siddhi...

451
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,280
My driver hasn't come today.

452
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,120
Can I get a lift to my mom's?

453
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,040
-So, are you doing...
-I'm fine.

454
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,560
-I know that...
-Please stop talking.

455
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,160
-I just want...
-Please stop!
