1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,920
<i>Did you play stapoo as a child?</i>

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,840
<i>Hopscotch?</i>

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,640
<i>You have to jump from one square to next.</i>

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,240
<i>And move forward without any baggage.</i>

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,600
<i>I wish life was like that.</i>

6
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,600
Hey! Good morning.

7
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,200
Want a kale smoothie?

8
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,680
I did a fruit and veg run.

9
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,520
-Sure, yeah.
-It's on the counter.

10
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,000
What is SKFC?

11
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,040
Samara Kapoor Fan Club.

12
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,280
They call themselves "Samaratans,"

13
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,480
and their Facebook page

14
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,600
is dedicated to me!

15
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,800
I feel so loved.

16
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,520
We need to file a FIR.

17
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,360
It's hate speech.
Doesn't prove that they did it.

18
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,400
What are you doing?

19
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,400
Replying with a few choice comments.

20
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,400
Are you mad? No point, dude.

21
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,600
Social media war never helps.

22
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,040
We should wait it out.

23
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,800
They're kids, they'll get bored.

24
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,880
Dude, when?
When will this woman stop haunting me?

25
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,280
-Hey.
-Hi.

26
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,040
Not bad.

27
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,440
-You're quite an artist.
-Thanks.

28
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,080
I'll see you inside.

29
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,400
-Bye!
-See you.

30
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,720
You just hired him a few days ago.

31
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,160
You're already making him
clean up the mess.

32
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,360
I'm just getting my money's worth.

33
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,960
I have to go prepare for my comeback show.

34
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,880
I'm nervous. When will I see you?

35
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,760
It's tonight?

36
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,120
Mangs, you're ditching me?

37
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,240
I have an accounts review meeting.

38
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,560
It slipped my mind.

39
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,560
-I have a meeting...
-Radha is on leave today...

40
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,320
-So sorry.
-I'm sorry.

41
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,640
Wow. Fine.

42
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,560
-Just this time, sorry.
-Sids!

43
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,000
Returning from a long sabbatical,

44
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,520
please welcome
the very funny, Siddhi Patel!

45
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,320
We missed you, Siddhi!

46
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,720
Okay.

47
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,600
So, how many of you have single moms?

48
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,080
How many of you have
single moms who started dating?

49
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,280
Red shirt wanted to raise his hand,

50
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,400
but then he changed his mind.

51
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,840
Because we're talking
about moms after all.

52
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,400
And how can anyone discuss
their mom's love life?

53
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,080
Right? Except,

54
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,160
that's exactly what I'm going to do today.

55
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,680
What's wrong? You look scandalized.

56
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,640
Please wait, sir,
this was just the starter.

57
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,640
The "mom course" is yet to come.

58
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,960
So, since my dad passed away,

59
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,560
my mom seems to have developed
what you may call a golden vagina.

60
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,000
You know all those boring uncles

61
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,920
whose wives had sex only twice with them?

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,680
When they want to conceive?

63
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,360
All those men think that
my mom is the goldmine of vaginas.

64
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,680
And everyone knows this.

65
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,480
I know it. They know it.

66
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,880
You know it. The entire colony knows it.

67
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,240
Even the building watchman knows it,
but my mom doesn't.

68
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,920
She thinks all these men
are being helpful.

69
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,240
"Manohar is so sweet."

70
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,160
"Did you see? Mahendar is so caring."

71
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,360
Yeah, caring.

72
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,360
Manohar has already been
on ten Amsterdam trips with my mom.

73
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,440
And Mahendar is
obsessed with her, you know...

74
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,080
So, basically, a 48-year-old single woman
has only one option.

75
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,240
To spread her legs for any horny man.

76
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,680
Sometimes I feel we have gone
400 years back instead

77
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,760
of stepping into a modern age.

78
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,360
We're still being forced
to jump into the fire.

79
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,600
So, ladies, tell me,

80
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,440
what kind of wood would you like
for your designer pyre?

81
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,480
Mango wood or rose wood?

82
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,120
Thank you. That was my time.

83
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,720
Green tea?

84
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,560
You deserve something stronger.

85
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,320
Seriously? That's your pick-up line?

86
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,040
Lame.

87
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,840
If I used a pick-up line,

88
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,560
I would've said you deserve
something stronger, like me.

89
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,520
You are strong, are you?

90
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,840
I'm Rahul.

91
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,880
-You might've heard...
-Don't say that please.

92
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,960
Big fan.

93
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,200
This audience
couldn't recognize your talent.

94
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,800
Only you did.
That's why I should sleep with you?

95
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,320
-Do you want to?
-You forgot.

96
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,280
My mom has the golden vagina.

97
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,600
I just have a normal, boring one.

98
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,560
Breathe out and <i>Hasta Padasana.</i>

99
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,560
<i>Hasta Padasana,</i> we come down
into <i>Hasta Padasana.</i>

100
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,640
And breathe out.

101
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,800
You don't need that extra slice of pizza.

102
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,080
<i>Hasta Sanchalanasan.</i>

103
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,200
Great sex is in your power.

104
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,320
<i>Dandasana</i> now. Hips up a bit.

105
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,440
But bad sex is also in your power,
so choose wisely.

106
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,560
And now we go to <i>Ashtanga Namaskara.</i>

107
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,000
Have your knees on the floor.

108
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,200
Meher! Hi.

109
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,280
Good morning.

110
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,360
How about that tour?

111
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,760
-Now?
-Yeah.

112
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,840
-See you downstairs.
-Sweetie, come on.

113
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,200
Hi, Kiana. My mama and dada.

114
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,960
-Hi, Arya.
-What's up?

115
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,720
Hi, Gautam. My mama and dada.
We live in the same house.

116
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,160
Baby, no need to announce that.

117
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,920
-Why, Mama?
-Because Mama says so.

118
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,240
Now go and have a great day at school.

119
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,440
-Love you.
-Love you.

120
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,880
Finish your lunch, okay?

121
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,680
-Bye, Mama. Bye, Dada.
-Bye.

122
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,400
I'm beginning to think

123
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,280
we have irrevocably scarred our child.

124
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,000
You. Not we.

125
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,520
Arya and I were perfectly fine.

126
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,480
Until you dumped your farty ass
on my couch.

127
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,360
My ass is not farty.

128
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,720
It's an upside-down heart. See?

129
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,600
My bum, my bum.

130
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,040
Stop it. It's a school.

131
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,280
-Sorry.
-Good morning, ma'am.

132
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,840
Okay, listen.

133
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,000
Call Kavya, please.

134
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,880
I called her

135
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,000
and even her parents.

136
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,720
They said to give her more time.

137
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,920
So, me and my bum

138
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,840
will have to wait.

139
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,480
Okay.

140
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,520
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

141
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,280
This really is a lovely studio.

142
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,040
Thank you.

143
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,360
No, really, I mean,

144
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,880
you can take risks only when
you know that you have it in you.

145
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,360
I mean, to make a fresh start,
and by yourself? It takes guts.

146
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,280
Honestly speaking, I didn't do it alone.

147
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,320
I had my partner with me, Siddhi.

148
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,160
Mixing love with work?

149
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,200
That's brave.

150
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,520
No, Siddhi is my business partner,
and more than that, she's my best friend.

151
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,040
-And she's straight, so...
-I'm sorry. My bad.

152
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,960
Then it's the best partnership.

153
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,520
Yeah, it is.

154
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,480
And I'm really lucky
because I have three best friends.

155
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,400
We are thick as thieves.

156
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,520
How perfect.

157
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,200
Have you been to Truck Bar?

158
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,760
No? It's our spot.

159
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,480
Our safe space.

160
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,600
Do you have a safe space?

161
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,400
My bakery.

162
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,120
My daughter, Tara.

163
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,240
And I now feel,

164
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,760
this could be it.

165
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,440
Come, let's go.

166
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,760
This will work?

167
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,880
Indian youth feel alienated
from politicians, not politics.

168
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,760
Focus on their issues because no one does.

169
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,760
You'll be fine.

170
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,640
I'm 15 years older than them.

171
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,080
Do I speak their language?

172
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,440
Others are 50 years older than them.

173
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,880
You're their best bet.

174
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,040
-You think so?
-I know so.

175
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,640
I don't believe in myself as much.

176
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,520
Damini Rizvi Roy really likes me.

177
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,120
Who would've thought?

178
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,840
Hi, Arav. I missed you. Did you miss me?

179
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,960
Meeta is doing a great job with Arav.

180
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,480
I can leave
if you don't want me to be here.

181
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,400
Yes, I feel betrayed by you.

182
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,160
But I'm mad at Varun, not you.

183
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,760
He has a problem.

184
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,120
He runs away
from every single responsibility.

185
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,240
I didn't see this coming.

186
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,720
He tried to sabotage the relationship
after Arya and now,

187
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,000
after Arav, he's doing the same thing.

188
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,360
It's like, he's feeling trapped,
so he's subconsciously trying to ruin it,

189
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,640
so that he can be free.

190
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,880
Kavya, Varun has

191
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,480
been ten times a better husband and father

192
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,360
than he was when Arya was born.

193
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,040
But ten times better is not enough.
The bar is so low!

194
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,720
He's trying. He's trying to change.

195
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,840
-Really?
-Yeah.

196
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,480
Then why did he kiss you?

197
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,280
We were reliving the old days.
It just happened.

198
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,640
We withdrew immediately.

199
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,720
And it had nothing to do
with your pregnancy or...

200
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,720
him wanting to escape.

201
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,240
I don't believe that.
I've had time to think about it.

202
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,400
Varun has issues he needs to sort out.

203
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,160
Arav is just a baby.

204
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,600
You need each other.

205
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,640
You're saying that?

206
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,760
You've done well without him.

207
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,880
Arya punched Gautam so many times
that we're all in shock.

208
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,200
Has anything changed at home?

209
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,240
-No.
-Yes.

210
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,400
I mean, I'm living
with Arya and her mother now.

211
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,200
Temporarily. We're divorced.

212
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,360
-Expel that psycho, please.
-Excuse me?

213
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,920
You know, my son Gautam is traumatized.

214
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,520
Miss Sheetal, I want to know
how this happened.

215
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,920
-So do I.
-So do I.

216
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,840
As do I.

217
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,960
Apparently, Arya told Gautam
that her dad and mom live with her.

218
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,120
Gautam called her a liar-liar.

219
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,280
His mother told him

220
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,120
her mother is a...

221
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,800
-What?
-Sorry?

222
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,880
Loose prostitute.

223
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,960
-Prostitute?
-Loose prostitute.

224
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,640
Anjana is a lawyer.

225
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,040
I guess that qualifies as a prostitute.

226
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,760
Oldest profession.

227
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,800
I have tremendous respect
for "prostitutes."

228
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,200
Did you know,
prostitution is legal in 15 countries.

229
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:10,200
Technically, it's not illegal in India,
though soliciting and pimping is.

230
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,840
-I married a smart woman.
-Then divorced her.

231
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,960
But I assure you,
it was my sperm that helped create Arya.

232
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,240
She has my ears.
Whatever she might be, she's not a liar.

233
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,400
Let's go?

234
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,360
After you, Ms. Prostitute.

235
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,080
<i>-Ciao.</i>
-Thank you, Miss Sheetal.

236
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,800
Sorry.

237
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,000
Thank you. Toast?

238
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,320
-Yes, please.
-All right.

239
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,200
-Eggs?
-Yes, please.

240
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,320
By the way,
it's the Sethnas' 40th anniversary.

241
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,520
My parents want
to have dinner tomorrow at 9:00 p.m.

242
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,120
But I'll be at Town Hall with Dhananjay.

243
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,760
That's in the evening.

244
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm sure you can come after.

245
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,080
I'm taking a night off, too.

246
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,280
They wanna meet you.

247
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,520
Fine. I'll be there at 9:00 p.m.

248
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,720
Thank you.

249
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,080
What's so funny?

250
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,280
Nothing, just Dhananjay.

251
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,920
Dhananjay what?

252
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,800
A political joke you won't get.

253
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,160
I won't get it because,
what, I'm not smart enough?

254
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,080
Because you won't get the context.

255
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,320
It's an inside joke.

256
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,200
Inside jokes in three weeks?

257
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,240
Politicians don't swap parties so fast.

258
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,800
What's happening here?

259
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,440
Just making a political joke.

260
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,920
Nice! Okay, take five. Good job.

261
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,400
-Hey! Shall we begin?
-Yes.

262
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,440
Siddhi darling?

263
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,760
Do you have those tourmaline earrings?

264
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,680
-May I have them, please?
-Yeah.

265
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,080
Wow! Where are you off to?

266
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,760
Just a dance class.

267
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,400
Basic Jive and Ballroom dancing.

268
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,680
With?

269
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,040
Don't tell me Heera
and Meenu Auntie again.

270
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,240
So boring.

271
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,000
Remember the gentleman from the workshop?

272
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,440
You met him. Rajan?

273
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,960
Your instructor?

274
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,960
I didn't know he teaches dancing, too.

275
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:18,920
No.

276
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,800
-I'm going with him.
-What?

277
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,840
-Like, on a date?
-What?

278
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,200
No, not a date.

279
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,560
A very non-date, friendly outing.

280
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,280
What is a "non-date, friendly outing"?

281
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,320
Siddhi, please!

282
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,160
Don't make a mountain out of a molehill.

283
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,160
It's Thursday. Our pizza and movie night.

284
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,160
I know.

285
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,040
Tomorrow night.
Two pizzas, two movies, I promise.

286
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,840
Come on.

287
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,880
Cheer up.

288
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,280
All right.

289
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,280
Okay.
This is blueberry, this is lemon, right?

290
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,080
Okay. All right.

291
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,960
Woman, you

292
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,320
are a magician.

293
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,000
There's a foodgasm going on

294
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,080
in my mouth.

295
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,280
I haven't been dancing in ages.

296
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,560
To be honest, neither have I.

297
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,040
But you know what?

298
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,720
We're still young, so...

299
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,240
Young maybe, but not so light anymore.

300
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,200
Rubbish.

301
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,560
You're as light as a souffle.

302
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,440
Hopefully not a cheese one because

303
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,000
that plays havoc with the stomach
so I can't move.

304
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,160
Okay, then strawberry souffle.

305
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,080
In fact, you know what?

306
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,960
You look so light,
I could've picked you up easily.

307
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,000
Except for my slipped disc, so...

308
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,800
I have a really good physio.

309
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,560
-I'll share his number.
-Thanks.

310
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,800
And you know what?
I know a very good acupuncturist.

311
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,080
I'll share his number.

312
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,080
We're sharing doctors already.
This is moving very fast.

313
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,200
-Shall we?
-Thank you.

314
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,560
How long has it been?

315
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,040
-Baking since I was eight.
-Nice.

316
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,040
-My father taught me.
-Wow.

317
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,080
-And Meher Bakes?
-Three years now.

318
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,400
-Right after my divorce.
-Oh, man.

319
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,760
Marriage.

320
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,040
It takes courage.

321
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,080
Quite a bit.

322
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,080
Actually,

323
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,640
it was a mistake to get married.

324
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,440
I shouldn't have carried on
for so many years.

325
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,480
I loved Ayesha.

326
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,680
Ayesha loved me, you know?

327
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,080
We were 18.

328
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,240
Our parents found out.

329
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,800
Oh, man, the drama!

330
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,640
The pressure.

331
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,720
Ayesha gave up.

332
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,560
She got married.

333
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,920
I got confused.

334
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,560
Harish happened to be there.

335
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,400
So he became my husband.

336
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,560
So your husband knew?

337
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,480
He was my friend then.

338
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,800
He said he understands.

339
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,240
After marriage, it was next level.

340
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,320
He wanted a cookie-cutter wife.

341
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,400
He would tell me what to wear,

342
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,560
how to look, what to eat,

343
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,960
why not make new friends,
why not keep old ones,

344
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,400
et cetera, et cetera.

345
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,720
-So how did it end?
-My daughter, Tara.

346
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,400
Thank God for her.

347
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,280
Because when she turned 18,

348
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,800
she pulled me out of that misery.

349
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,920
She reminded me of my strengths.

350
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,760
She became that...

351
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,200
best friend I never had.

352
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,680
And she knows?

353
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,200
She knows.

354
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,720
You're so much stronger than you know.

355
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,680
Over 35% of the population
is under the age of 25.

356
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,080
You're the future of this country.

357
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,320
Our party might be old,

358
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,320
but our ideology must be new.

359
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,800
Then say something new.

360
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,200
Your party has been singing the same tune
for the last 100 years.

361
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,760
This is not a tune. Please let me finish.

362
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,000
Do you have anything real to say?

363
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,520
Otherwise, ask your PR
to tweet it for you.

364
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,920
Please. You have to...

365
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Please listen to me. Let me finish...

366
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,520
Wait a second!

367
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,960
Give Dhananjay a chance.

368
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,720
You want him to listen to you, right?

369
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,320
So then speak to him.

370
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,040
Question him, argue with him,
don't heckle him.

371
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,120
You rightly pointed out that

372
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,360
he didn't say anything new.

373
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,400
So, here's your chance.

374
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,720
Ask for answers.

375
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,640
You serious?

376
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,760
I'm Damini Rizvi Roy, and it is said
on social media that I never smile.

377
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,880
I'm serious. Ask him.

378
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,520
So, Dhananjay, sir...

379
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,320
This isn't a classroom.

380
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,120
-Call him Dhananjay.
-Okay.

381
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,320
-Dhananjay, hi.
-Hi.

382
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,800
Thoughts on dissenting universities?

383
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,080
Well, I think
dissent is crucial in a democracy.

384
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,000
Sorry, it's a little hot.

385
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,760
Make no mistake about it.

386
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,120
This is a democracy.

387
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,200
You students are

388
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,320
the leaders of tomorrow.

389
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,080
If we don't listen to you today,

390
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,080
then tomorrow,
the nation won't listen to us.

391
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,240
I see you.

392
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,480
Feel free to grill him.
You have my full support.

393
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,680
-Thank you.
-Please.

394
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:21,800
A lot of outdated courses are being
reintroduced in the universities.

395
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,760
Your thoughts?

396
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,720
I think it's ridiculous.

397
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,520
I mean, some say
there's no such thing as global warming.

398
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,400
And others say that if life and death
are in the hands of God,

399
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,240
why go to a doctor?

400
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,840
I spoke to the Vice Chancellor.

401
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,440
He promised me that all controversial

402
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,680
and outdated courses will be dropped.

403
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,720
So, don't worry.

404
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,680
There'll be no Diploma
in Occult Sciences here.

405
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,080
It's crazy.

406
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,800
They're heckling me one minute...

407
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,440
and now they want selfies.

408
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,160
Damini,

409
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,360
you're amazing.

410
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,200
It's you, Dhananjay. All you.

411
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,920
Celebration drink?

412
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,880
Come on.

413
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,840
One drink.

414
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,640
You'll wear this?

415
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,600
Very funny. That's not for me.

416
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,720
That's for Rajan.

417
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,160
I'm helping him out.

418
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,360
His wife used to do all his shopping.

419
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,120
And the poor man
has awful taste in clothes.

420
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,520
What did you get for me?

421
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,520
I haven't bought you anything since 2005.

422
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,600
You hate my taste.

423
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,120
When did I say that?

424
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,240
And how can you
when you're busy with Rajan?

425
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,720
Rajan this, Rajan that,
Rajan, that's all I've been hearing.

426
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,120
I'm nothing to you now.

427
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,160
Let's do
our four-cheese pizza and a movie?

428
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,840
Keep your stupid pity-party with you.

429
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,800
So, now I get the true meaning
of, "I'm my own favorite person."

430
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,240
Because there's no one else
to compliment me.

431
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,880
Thank you for being so silent
and unresponsive tonight.

432
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,640
I mean, who cares.
The world is anyway ending.

433
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,320
Hi. Rahul?

434
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,360
Of "you might've heard my name" fame.
You killed it tonight.

435
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,840
Is the offer
for something stronger still valid?

436
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,440
Okay, say something funny?

437
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,320
Sometimes I wonder
if sex is even worth it.

438
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,200
-So much work and...
-Be nasty.

439
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,600
This wall is just like you.

440
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,320
-Empty.
-Nastier.

441
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,200
Do you know the difference
between kissing and slobbering?

442
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,520
Are you a man or a Pomeranian?

443
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,480
Shit.

444
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,120
My standards have really dropped.

445
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,240
Does your dating app
have a ten-year-old picture of you?

446
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,680
Not like someone
is gonna swipe right on you.

447
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,440
You look like you don't even have enemies.

448
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,800
I bet your colleagues
have an office Whatsapp group

449
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,320
without you in it.

450
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,320
What happened?

451
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,640
You asked me to be nasty.

452
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,560
Yeah!

453
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,680
But nasty in the bed.

454
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,560
Like bad girl nasty. Not nasty to me.

455
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,040
Don't you have a heart?

456
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,840
-Okay, I'm gonna...
-Not so fast.

457
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,800
At least say sorry to me.

458
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,240
Try to comfort me.

459
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,440
"The warrior princess won the battle.

460
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,280
"She made her village proud.

461
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,000
"And she was able to provide
for her family

462
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,840
"protection from the enemies
attacking them."

463
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,480
Story over, Dada?

464
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,400
-Sleepy time, come.
-I want to sleep with Dada.

465
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,000
But Dada sleeps on the couch.

466
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,000
Why?

467
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,880
Why? Because we are divorced now.

468
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,160
-Yeah.
-But we live together.

469
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,520
Do you want to sleep with Mama?

470
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,520
With Mama and Dada.

471
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,720
Okay. That's enough.

472
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,240
-You're not the boss of us, okay?
-Come on.

473
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,880
Let's go to sleep!

474
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,680
You know, Anj, right now in my life,

475
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,320
this is the only thing going right.

476
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,360
You, me, Arya.

477
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,520
You and Kavya love each other.
That's all that matters.

478
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,760
Then why is she not taking my calls?

479
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,360
You know, in my life,

480
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,280
my work, my marriage, I've only fucked up.

481
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,840
How do you manage this every time?

482
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,480
When will I grow up?

483
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,720
Adulting is hard, Varun.

484
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,760
Shashank and you? All good?

485
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,000
As I said,

486
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,320
adulting is hard, Varun.

487
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,280
-Touché.
-Mama.

488
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,520
-Arya baby?
-Bad dreams.

489
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,440
Let me adult.

490
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,960
Come on.

491
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,960
Let's go to bed

492
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,440
and scare those crazy monsters.

493
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,240
Assholes!

494
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,640
What is "cunty"?

495
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,640
A cuss word, sir.

496
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,280
-And "Dykay"?
-Dyke.

497
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,680
What does that mean?

498
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,720
A derogatory word for lesbian.

499
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,560
Lesbian?

500
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,560
Lesbian, meaning?

501
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,480
Girls who like girls.

502
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,360
What the fuck?

503
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,840
Simply say gay!

504
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,120
At least 377 is out.

505
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,440
Or what?

506
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,880
Would you arrest me?

507
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,440
Trying to teach me my job?

508
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,520
Yes. I am.

509
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,920
What do you mean?

510
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,800
-Who do you think you are?
-Hold on.

511
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,440
-What...
-Talk to her!

512
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,280
-Seriously, what the fuck! Get off me!
-Okay!

513
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,800
Why'd you pull me out?

514
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,120
You'd be in jail,
and I can't handle the studio accounts.

515
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,520
Is this a joke to you?

516
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,960
I spent seven days in jail
because of my rage.

517
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,960
Rage isn't the answer, it's the problem.

518
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,200
I know what's better.

519
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,360
Come on.

520
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,680
Gimme a left-right.

521
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,560
That's it, left-right.

522
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,920
Brilliant. Left-right. That's it.

523
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,400
Left-right.

524
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,520
Left-right. That's it. One more.
That's it. One more.

525
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,960
Harder! That's it.

526
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,840
That's it. Turn. Move, move.

527
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,080
Keep the guard up.

528
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,640
Keep the guard up. Ready?

529
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,200
Now give me a right-duck-right.

530
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,880
Come on, keep the guard up.

531
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,240
Hey, keep your guard up.

532
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,800
Okay.

533
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,480
You want more?

534
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,200
Come on. Harder.

535
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,560
I'm so sorry. Sorry!

536
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,360
The students had too many questions.

537
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,040
Hi! How are you?

538
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,160
-How is the family?
-Work comes first.

539
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,680
I'm so sorry.

540
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,320
So sorry.

541
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,640
There were endless questions.

542
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,400
Shall we?

543
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,160
But Damini hasn't eaten yet.

544
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,640
-Please order something.
-Sure.

545
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,880
Hi. Can I have the...

546
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,840
How was the anniversary party?

547
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,240
The Sethnas' invited
all the Parsis they knew.

548
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,440
But still, only a few people came.

549
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,640
Sad, no?

550
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:09,240
There are just
70,000 Parsis left in India.

551
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:11,960
Now,

552
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,760
you two have to do something.

553
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,800
-Get married.
-Dad, please.

554
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,160
You two

555
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,680
have had a fight or what?

556
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,120
No, everything is fine.

557
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,200
-Sure?
-Yeah.

558
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,640
Everything is all right.

559
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:51,600
The live feed ended in the evening.
What took you so long?

560
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,960
We were discussing strategies.

561
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,160
Over a single malt?

562
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,160
I can smell it on your breath.

563
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,640
Is that a problem?

564
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,160
I have a problem with lies.

565
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,400
I'm sorry.

566
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:12,920
Why, Damini?

567
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,960
I don't know.

568
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,560
I should've told you. I'm sorry.

569
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,400
You keep saying sorry these days.
