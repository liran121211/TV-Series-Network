1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,240
<i>Good is such an overrated word.</i>

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,440
<i>Good baby, good girl, good friend,
good daughter, good wife, good mother.</i>

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,280
<i>Trying to be good
all the time is exhausting.</i>

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,840
<i>Maybe it's time to say goodbye to good.</i>

5
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,440
Sean.

6
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,800
Umang.

7
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,160
Is everything okay?

8
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,600
I'm...

9
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,800
I'm messed up.

10
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,080
-You're not.
-I am messed up.

11
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,240
I was confused
between Meher and Samara and you and...

12
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,600
My mind was just fucked, you know?

13
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,440
And I used you.

14
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,360
I know.

15
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,040
You're still not over her.

16
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,080
-Meher and I were barely a thing.
-No. Samara.

17
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,040
It's complicated, you know?
I felt so suffocated and...

18
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,080
Look.

19
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,480
You don't owe me an explanation.

20
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,280
Honestly. It's all good.

21
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,760
No, it's not.

22
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,960
I guess Meher was right.
You know, I just...

23
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,320
You know, what do you do
with all this pain? I...

24
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,360
Where does all this love go?

25
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,280
Why does it hurt so much
to see her with somebody else?

26
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,800
It's so messed up.

27
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,040
Because you still love her.

28
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,120
No, I...

29
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,640
I don't know, I just...

30
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,240
Look.

31
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,080
Everyone's a mess, Umang.

32
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,320
Love doesn't go anywhere.

33
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,360
People do.

34
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,000
We'll figure it out eventually.

35
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,800
-Or not.
-Or not?

36
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,800
Or not.

37
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,040
Can we stay friends?

38
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,080
How are you like this?

39
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,320
I was born a great person.

40
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,800
And then a lot
of straight-up years of abuse.

41
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,200
Yeah, of course we can stay friends.

42
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,240
Do you wanna help me with the set up?

43
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,040
-Please, Anj, just get it.
-Varun?

44
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,480
-I'm an artist.
-Yeah, sure.

45
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,600
-Don't interrupt my flow.
-Artist!

46
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,160
Isn't Dada an artist?

47
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,960
No.

48
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,720
-Hey.
-Is Varun here?

49
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,440
I'm not here to make a scene.
I just want to speak to him.

50
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,680
Dada, see this.

51
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,040
Nice!

52
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,080
-Hi, Pooky Auntie.
-Hi.

53
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,440
Hi.

54
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,320
Arav said his first word yesterday.

55
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,600
"Papa."

56
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,480
I kept trying to make him
say "Mama", you know?

57
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,480
But he said "Papa".

58
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,160
Remember that,
during pregnancy, you were convinced

59
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,160
that his first word would be "Fart"

60
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,640
because I had so much gas
and kept talking about it so much.

61
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,560
I guess when you're a papa like me,
these words become almost synonymous.

62
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,120
Kavs...

63
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,000
I am sorry.

64
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,960
For everything.

65
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,920
I'm an idiot. I'm an ass. I'm an asshole.

66
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,360
You're right to file for divorce.

67
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,800
Come home, Varun.

68
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,720
Arav and I, we need you to come home.

69
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,760
-Can you forgive me?
-That's why I'm here.

70
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,440
I miss you.

71
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,480
I'm angry at you, but I miss you more.

72
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,760
I miss us.

73
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,920
I miss us too.

74
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,480
How long should we treasure
someone's things?

75
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,200
Until letting them go stops upsetting us.

76
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,400
How long should we treasure
our loved ones?

77
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,800
You should never let them go.

78
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,920
Siddhi,

79
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:37,000
you should reapply
for your writing course.

80
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,240
-No.
-Darling, it's time.

81
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,640
Mommy, I don't want
to leave you alone here.

82
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,200
Don't worry about me.

83
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,400
I must learn to live by myself, Siddhi.

84
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,880
And what about Rajan?

85
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,760
That chapter is over.

86
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,440
Rajan understood.

87
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,760
Are you leaving right away?

88
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,240
After Arya sleeps.

89
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,080
I'll talk to her.

90
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,520
Hi.

91
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,320
What you doing, baby?

92
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,760
I'm not a baby, I'm a big girl.

93
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,280
You'll always be my baby.

94
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,600
Even when you are 80 years old.

95
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,760
Then I will be old baby.

96
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,440
Arya,

97
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,640
Dada is going back to Arav's house.

98
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,440
That's okay, Mama.

99
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,520
He's my Dada first, then Arav's.

100
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,640
But Arav is so small, he needs Dada.

101
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,160
And I need you.

102
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,600
Now, you will make the boat.

103
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,840
Yes.

104
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,200
Will you teach me how to make a boat?

105
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,160
Yes.

106
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,640
-Bye.
-Bye, Varun.

107
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,760
Do you know what tonight was?

108
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,720
My film. My fucking film premiere.

109
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,560
And instead of enjoying all the attention
and the accolades,

110
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,760
I'm thinking about you.

111
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:48,000
You! Because this city makes me crazy now
and my apartment makes me crazy.

112
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,920
I would appreciate it,
if you could get out of my fucking head!

113
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,840
You owe me that at least!

114
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,720
I don't owe you anything.

115
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,880
You left me at the altar.
Of course you don't owe me anything.

116
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,640
-Does Ana know you're here?
-Yeah. We tell each other everything.

117
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,640
-I'm sure you do.
-What?

118
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,800
-We tell each other everything.
-I'm sure you do.

119
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,520
I needed you.

120
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,400
Needed me?

121
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,240
Samara's needs,
Samara's wants, Samara's desires.

122
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,240
If you could see beyond yourself,
you would've realized,

123
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,960
how suffocated I was.

124
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:50,640
Really? You could've said something.
You could've given me a heads-up.

125
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,760
What could I say?

126
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,200
What you said in front of 50 other people.

127
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,480
When I just poured my heart out to you.

128
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,240
I said it so many times,
but you never listened.

129
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,120
I thought we had a relationship
based on honesty,

130
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,040
not beating around the bush!

131
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,080
That's exactly
what we didn't have, Sam. Honesty.

132
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,480
You wanna talk about honesty?

133
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,480
I appeared in your cheap,
little fitness videos.

134
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,720
I gave you my house, my time,
my contacts, everything!

135
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,040
I risked my entire career
when I proposed to you.

136
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,440
I sponsored our wedding.
I paid for everything!

137
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,840
I worked really hard
and you couldn't take one little trip?

138
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,880
Trip? A trip is for two or three days,
not for an entire year!

139
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:51,720
And did you ever stop...
Did you even think of asking me?

140
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,800
I have a life, friends and career, too.

141
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,920
And, yes! Four years' worth of efforts
with those cheap, little fitness videos!

142
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,760
I did something for myself.

143
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,640
And it may not be as glamorous
as your life, but it's still valid.

144
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,560
It's my life!

145
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,400
And you expected me to pack everything up
and go away for one year?

146
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,520
And everything would wait
until I got back, right?

147
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,360
And I didn't play any role
in creating that life for you, right?

148
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,520
Yes, you did.

149
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,160
And for that, I thank you
from the bottom of my heart.

150
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,120
But that doesn't mean

151
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,160
I'm just obligated to do everything
that you expect of me!

152
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,840
Am I a second class citizen?

153
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,160
What are you even talking about?

154
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,200
See? You're not even listening.

155
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:48,120
What I'm trying to say
is that I want an equal relationship.

156
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,360
I don't want to be
Samara Kapoor's girlfriend or wife!

157
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,680
I want to be Umang Singh.

158
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,360
Hey, don't say "Samara's girlfriend"
or "Samara's wife" like it's an insult.

159
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,880
Becoming Samara Kapoor was not easy.

160
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,320
It wasn't easy becoming
Umang Singh either.

161
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,280
You know what you are?
You're fucking ungrateful.

162
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,600
Would you listen to yourself?

163
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,600
"You are ungrateful."
How entitled can you be?

164
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,320
I loved you.

165
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,480
I loved you too.

166
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,320
Hey! How is Bengaluru?

167
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,200
<i>I've only seen the traffic
and conference rooms.</i>

168
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,080
And these unexpected rains.

169
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,880
Listen, you were right.

170
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,400
I need to take charge
of my excess luggage.

171
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,000
I mean, I want to start afresh.

172
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,640
-With you.
-With me?

173
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,640
As friends?

174
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,960
I like nice guys.

175
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,800
<i>-Actually, I'm not a nice guy at all.</i>
-Really?

176
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,560
<i>When it snows heavily in New York,
I sometimes skip bathing.</i>

177
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,960
Sometimes, I don't vacuum
my house for two weeks straight.

178
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,720
And don't even mention the socks.
I wear the same pair everyday.

179
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,520
<i>I'm the Indian who creates the stereotypes
and never leaves a tip.</i>

180
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,160
I'm worse. I only think about myself.

181
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:18,920
Forget two weeks,
I've never cleaned my house or my room.

182
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,040
I'm the golden combo
of being privileged and lazy.

183
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,480
I pay others to do my bidding,

184
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,160
and it was all so easy
till I had to earn my own money.

185
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,560
Welcome to the 98% of the world,
Miss Entitled Brat.

186
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,560
<i>Why are you crying? It was only a joke.</i>

187
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,080
-I'll talk to you later.
<i>-Siddhi, listen...</i>

188
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,000
Siddhi, what's the matter? Are you okay?

189
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,680
-Mama!
-What's the matter?

190
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,320
What happened, darling?

191
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,440
I don't know, Mama.

192
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,560
It's like the compass inside me is broken

193
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:08,240
and just I'm feeling so lost. I'm so lost.

194
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,560
Siddhi, if we had all the answers at 25,
we'd all be monks like Gautama Buddha.

195
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,320
Give yourself some time, darling.

196
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,560
It's okay. Let's not worry.

197
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,680
Mama?

198
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,000
Yes, darling?

199
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,040
We are a family.

200
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,560
This is done. This is not bad. Come try...

201
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,960
-Very nice.
-Thank you!

202
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:14,080
-Should I grate more papaya for the salad?
-That's enough for the two of us.

203
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,720
You can never have enough
bean papaya salad.

204
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,520
Who could it be at this hour?

205
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,200
-Let me check.
-Yeah.

206
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,440
-Good evening.
-Rajan?

207
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,520
I invited him.

208
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,960
You weren't calling him, so...

209
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:51,960
It's nice.

210
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,080
-Are you going to New York for the course?
-Yes.

211
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,320
It's a one year diploma course
in comedy writing.

212
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,560
Wow.

213
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,080
-That's nice.
-Thanks.

214
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,280
Okay, guys.

215
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:30,400
I invited you over because I wanted
to say that you have my blessing.

216
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,040
Siddhi?

217
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:37,320
Whatever you plans are,
I promise I'm gonna be onboard with them.

218
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,800
-As in?
-As in... Getting married?

219
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,760
-Are you crazy?
-What?

220
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,200
What did I say that's so wrong?

221
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:55,920
Siddhi, I've spent
my entire adult life being married.

222
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,120
I want to spend
the rest of my life being single. Okay?

223
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,480
Same here.

224
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,160
I don't want to get married again.

225
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,200
Not interested.

226
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,960
But what's wrong with getting married?

227
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,800
And you keep trying to force me
to get married, Mama.

228
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,240
There's nothing wrong
with getting married.

229
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,000
But I've had one wonderful marriage.

230
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,280
That's enough.
I don't need another. That's all.

231
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,320
In fact...

232
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,920
I'm also used to living alone.

233
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,520
I like my space.

234
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,400
And I plan
on getting used to my space. Okay?

235
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:42,880
Siddhi, one day you'll understand
that one's space is what's most important.

236
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,600
Now that that's out of the system...

237
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,280
Eat. We can go back to eating.

238
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,240
Sir, I'm leaving now.

239
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,560
-Thank you, Bosco.
-Bye.

240
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,200
-See you tomorrow.
-Bye.

241
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,680
Why the long face?

242
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,600
How should I look then?

243
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,240
Like someone who's finally at peace
with his decision.

244
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,480
-I didn't want to make this decision.
-Did you change your mind?

245
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,640
Not really. No.

246
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,240
You know what?
I've realized this relationship was wrong.

247
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,680
It wasn't healthy.
Not for her, not for me.

248
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,400
Both of us are looking
for something else in life.

249
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,840
Why are we always looking for something?

250
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,080
Why can't we be happy with what we have?

251
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:47,160
Says you who dumped
the world's prettiest girl at the altar.

252
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,080
I know. So fucked up!

253
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:53,000
If being happy was easy,
we'd all be growing potatoes in a commune.

254
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,720
No potatoes. Kale and quinoa.

255
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,280
Sorry!

256
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,240
Let's go start our own commune in Goa.

257
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,560
-Let's go.
-Let's.

258
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,240
Hi, Anj.

259
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,840
What?

260
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,240
Okay, I'll be there. Yeah.

261
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,880
-I have the eviction notice.
-We have the original contract.

262
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,480
-This contract's legal.
-You can't do this.

263
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,240
-Go tell the evictions office. Start!
-Please...

264
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,200
-Hey!
-Step back.

265
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,480
-Get away from my bar!
-Sir, step back.

266
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,120
-Sir, we have court orders.
-This isn't right!

267
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,360
You'll be arrested!

268
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,000
This place is my home!

269
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,360
Sir, you can't do this.

270
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,320
-Sir, no...
-I'll call the police.

271
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,320
-Let me go! You can't do this!
-Sir, move!

272
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,040
{\an8}-Just wait a minute. Sir, this is my home!
-Get out of the way!

273
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,720
-What are you doing?
-This is my home.

274
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,000
-Just wait!
-Let me do my job!

275
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,360
Why are you doing this?
Why are you destroying my home?

276
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,560
-Please, step back!
-This is my home! Please!

277
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,040
-Break it down.
-No! Stop!

278
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,240
-This is wrong!
-Move aside.

279
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,680
Break it down.

280
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,520
Good.

281
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,840
Now...

282
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,480
It's so strange now.

283
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,760
Feels like just a moment ago,
I had everything.

284
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,120
I had Truck.

285
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:28,880
I had you.

286
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,680
You'll always have me, Jeh.

287
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,160
Yeah...

288
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,720
But not in the same way.

289
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,360
Remember when you told me
about how, in Japan,

290
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,080
lonely people hire people to hug them
and ask how their day was?

291
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,760
I need something like that.

292
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,320
I hope you'll share
your Japanese single malts with me.

293
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,480
Always. And I'll always love you, Damini.

294
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,760
And I'll always love you, Jeh.

295
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,920
It is time to rebuild.

296
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,160
But this time, start fresh.

297
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,400
Go back home. Goa, maybe.

298
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,960
A new life.

299
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,880
A new beginning.

300
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,080
Maybe I'm not built
for relationships, you know?

301
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,040
It took me a long time to realize that.

302
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,200
I'm so sorry, I...

303
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,480
-I've been through so much drama.
-Hey!

304
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,160
Your drama,

305
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,720
that drama was us.

306
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,320
I was getting used to it.

307
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,440
You know me as well as I know you.

308
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,600
Inside out.

309
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,560
That's why it's so damn hard.

310
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,560
Come here.

311
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,600
Papa, what brings you here?
Is everything all right?

312
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,480
What happened?

313
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,560
-Nothing.
-Is Mama all right?

314
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,360
Yes, she is.

315
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,800
Everything is fine.

316
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,120
Are you okay?

317
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,160
I just missed you.

318
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,360
I missed you so much.

319
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,320
My brave daughter.

320
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,280
Everything will be all right.

321
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,960
You're my brave daughter. Aren't you?

322
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,840
Masturbate alone, die alone.

323
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,080
-Hi.
<i>-Hi.</i>

324
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,240
-Couldn't sleep?
<i>-No.</i>

325
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,560
Me neither.

326
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,480
<i>Actually, I'm at the Mumbai airport.</i>

327
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,360
-Layover en route to New York.
<i>-New Year's on a plane? So boring you are.</i>

328
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,280
That I am.

329
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:07,960
Actually... It just seems strange
not to see your face when I'm here.

330
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,600
Mihir, I...

331
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,880
<i>What?</i>

332
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,400
Mihir...

333
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,600
<i>What?</i>

334
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,120
Mihir...

335
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,760
-Mihir, just wait. Wait!
<i>-Siddhi...</i>

336
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,960
-Sids, here you go.
-Where's the ticket?

337
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,760
Listen, Bangkok visa is on arrival.

338
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,080
-On arrival, yeah.
-God!

339
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,480
Okay. Go!

340
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,760
One sec. Hug!

341
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,640
Go!

342
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,920
-She has the ticket, right?
-Let her go!

343
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,640
Come on, dude!

344
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,080
Mihir!

345
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,800
Wait!

346
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,120
Mihir!

347
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,800
You... You actually came?

348
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,560
I told you to wait for me.

349
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,200
I thought you meant in life.

350
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,800
You're doing that anyway.

351
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,080
You're nuts! You know that, right?

352
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,840
Are you coming to New York?

353
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,080
-No. Bangkok.
-Why Bangkok?

354
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,320
Ticket's to Dubai were cheaper
but I needed a visa for it.

355
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,160
One second. What are you saying?

356
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,680
You need a ticket
to enter an airport and...

357
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,880
I just had to do this clichéd,
rom-com airport declaration for you.

358
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,040
But why?

359
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,640
Because you're the clichéd,
rom-com nice guy.

360
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,760
Okay. So, go on.

361
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,400
Mihir, I've got a deferred place
at the writing course in New York.

362
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,560
I'm moving to New York in February.

363
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,920
This is your rom-com speech?

364
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,520
PS. I love you.

365
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,640
-PS?
-That's all you get after all this money.

366
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,600
Yeah. But what if I need more?

367
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,320
Okay. Wait! Fine!

368
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,160
Fine...

369
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:38,880
Mihu-Pihu, you are the sugar
to my ice cream.

370
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,440
The fafda to my Jalebi.
The tonic to my gin.

371
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,000
The dandia to my Falguni.
The punchline to all my jokes.

372
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:51,160
You're just... I don't know.

373
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,760
Wait. That's it?

374
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,520
-Did you see him?
-Sids?

375
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:40,840
-What happened?
-Did you find him?

376
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,640
I found him!

377
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,360
-Yes! You did it!
-I'm so happy for you!

378
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,520
Tells us everything!

379
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:52,360
I had to run all the way there
and I barely caught him at the gate

380
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:56,320
-and he said he loves me too!
-That's amazing!

381
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,120
-Come on!
-Nine, eight, seven, six...

382
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,880
-Guys, please!
-...five, four, three, two, one...

383
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,600
Happy new year!

384
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,160
Guys!

385
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,880
I love this.

386
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,960
Girls.

387
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,360
-I'm getting a bit teary eyed.
-Why?

388
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,920
It's our last new year
with Sids in Mumbai.

389
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,480
Idiot, I'm not dying.

390
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:46,120
-It's a one-year course. That's it.
-With you, we never know.

391
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,640
You go for a year
and come back with a baby.

392
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,560
Never!

393
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,640
What? I mean, not anytime soon.
We'll see how it goes.

394
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,960
She'll video call us next month to say,
"Oh, my God, guys.

395
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,960
"Look at the huge rock
Mihir got me from Tiffany's!"

396
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,640
No way! You know what my resolution is?

397
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,880
I promise, I'll remain unmarried
and un-pregnant this year.

398
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,880
This means that, in three months,
we'll get the good news

399
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,760
and we're gonna have to run to New York
for a shotgun wedding.

400
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:22,000
No way! Never.
This year, my life will be perfect.

401
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,520
Whether it's career or sex.

402
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,000
Yes! Good.

403
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:34,440
And this year,
I promise that I won't run anymore.

404
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:40,520
I mean, I'll obviously continue cardio
and marathons, but not in life.

405
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:46,160
Not at home. Not from my responsibilities,
or relationships,

406
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:50,560
or from confrontations.

407
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,000
-Umang.
-Cheers to that.

408
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,280
Cheers.

409
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,520
My New Year's resolution is that

410
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,600
I will become a name partner
in the firm this year.

411
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,560
It'll happen.

412
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,920
And... I'll stay 20 kilometers away
from married men.

413
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,200
My God!

414
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,640
Whether they have an open
or closed marriage, or it's ajar,

415
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:22,120
or they're getting divorced
or are going through a separation.

416
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,120
And especially if that someone
happens to be my ex.

417
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,560
-My...
-Here, here!

418
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,640
Thank God!

419
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,840
-Thank you!
-Thanks, Anj!

420
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,800
Okay. I promise to be single.

421
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,560
-Come on!
-Just me and my work, nothing else!

422
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,160
Sticking to only one night hookups.

423
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,560
-Yeah, there you go.
-Never telling them my name.

424
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,600
Never showing them where I live.

425
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:51,280
And never, ever,
meeting them a second time.

426
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:55,160
-And never, ever...
-Is that gonna happen!

427
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,040
-I will prove it to you!
-It will happen.

428
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,840
We forgot the most important resolution.

429
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,080
-What?
-That no matter where we are physically,

430
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,960
we'll always be emotionally
and mentally together.

431
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,640
-Like Arya says, "Together, together."
-Together!

432
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:17,880
Okay. On that note,
here's to always calling our own shots.

433
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,880
Cheers!

434
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,920
-I'll miss you.
-Of course you will.

435
