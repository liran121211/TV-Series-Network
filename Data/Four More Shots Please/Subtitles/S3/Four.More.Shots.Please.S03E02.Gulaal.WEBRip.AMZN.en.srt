1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,720
<i>On Holi,
there's something special in the air.</i>

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,520
<i>Cannabis, fun, freedom, colors, and boom!</i>

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,560
<i>There go your inhibitions.</i>

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,040
<i>Good thing or a bad thing?</i>

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,400
<i>Whatever it is, do not fuss,
for it's Holi after all!</i>

6
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,440
Ms. Umang, investing in fitness studios
and gyms usually ends in a loss.

7
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,680
-Right.
-See, rent, electricity bills, salaries,

8
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,600
equipment, equipment maintenance...

9
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,200
I know there are overheads

10
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,520
but I also know that I can make it work.

11
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,120
And I'll break even in three years.

12
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,800
-I have experience...
-But as a personal trainer.

13
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,880
Not as an entrepreneur.

14
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,360
Thank you.

15
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,240
Sorry, Ms. Singh,
but you don't have any collateral.

16
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,960
Collateral.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,560
You should open a franchise
with a superstar.

18
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,120
Everyone's doing it.

19
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,080
I mean, I'm sure
Ms. Samara has some friends.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,720
Hrithik? Tiger? Salman?

21
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,680
Sure. I'll head to Bandra
and talk to Salman.

22
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,760
You know him?

23
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,320
Anjana, 'Happy Holi!'
Tomorrow 11am at my place

24
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,360
Radha!

25
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,080
Iron these clothes, please!

26
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,720
Arya, baby, please get ready quickly.

27
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,880
No!

28
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,360
Arya!

29
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,040
Darling.

30
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,360
That's enough. No more tantrums.

31
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,520
-No!
-Darling, please, we're getting late.

32
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,160
-Get ready. They'll be here soon.
-No!

33
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,920
If you don't wear your dress now,
then no more Holi party, okay?

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,240
No water balloons, no water guns,
no colors, and no dessert!

35
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,080
-No, no, no!
-Arya!

36
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,560
Arya!

37
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,360
Arya, stop!

38
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,920
I want to go to Dada.

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,600
I wanna play Holi with Arav.

40
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,120
We have a Holi party here with aunties.

41
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,800
-Please come out.
-No aunties.

42
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,560
-Only Arav.
-Arya, you need to stop.

43
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,040
You need to stop this.

44
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,640
-Arya, stop right now!
-No!

45
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,040
We're not going there
and that's final, okay?

46
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,280
White?

47
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,960
Filmy, are we?

48
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,120
It's the dress code.

49
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,600
Well, I love it.

50
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,480
And I can't wait for you
to get wet and wild.

51
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,560
I don't know about wet, but I'm wild.

52
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,000
Rather feral.

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,720
You know what the trolls call me.

54
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,240
A wild cat.

55
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,600
Make that a wild feral sexy cat.

56
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,920
<i>I'm addicted to your touch</i>

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,320
<i>I need it all the time</i>

58
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,760
<i>The things I wanna do to you</i>

59
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,760
<i>I can't keep them inside</i>

60
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,680
It's getting late.

61
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,600
Anj must be waiting.

62
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,680
I'm waiting too.

63
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,600
<i>I'm addicted to your touch</i>

64
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,240
<i>I need it all the time</i>

65
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,320
To be continued, I promise.

66
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,240
-Hi, Sneha.
-Amu.

67
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,240
It's so good to see you, Sneha.

68
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,360
I must say, you look great!

69
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,440
Almost glowing.

70
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,520
Hi!

71
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,640
Sneha?

72
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,360
Hi.

73
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,160
How are you holding up, darling?

74
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,640
I'm okay.

75
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,120
Seeing you, one wouldn't know
it's only been six months.

76
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,120
I mean, I wouldn't be
up and about so quickly.

77
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,280
But then again,

78
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,560
when were you ever conventional, Sneha?

79
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,560
Right.

80
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,440
I'll see you.

81
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,520
Poor thing.

82
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,840
So young.

83
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,040
Morning walks feel weird without Viju.

84
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,520
Gosh, I miss him so much.

85
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,600
I know.

86
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,080
It's tough to get by alone.

87
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,960
You know, if you need anything,

88
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,840
anything at all,

89
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,480
let me know.

90
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,560
I'll be there.

91
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,960
All right?

92
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,280
See you around.

93
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,680
Do they know sati got abolished
in the early 1800s?

94
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,080
Fuck it, let's get out of here.

95
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,400
Watch your language, Siddhi.

96
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,400
I'm sorry, Mummy,

97
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,120
but given what mood I'm in,
it could be a lot worse. Come on.

98
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:59,200
<i>You're overdue two months' rent.
I never had to remind you till now.</i>

99
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,320
Can you please give me some more time?

100
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,920
<i>How much more time?</i>

101
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,320
One month?

102
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,000
<i>All right.</i>

103
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,840
Thank you, Uncle.

104
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,280
Sorry.

105
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,960
ANJANA: Arya drama!
Party shifted to Varun's.

106
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:32,520
Alexa, play Varun's
supersonic Holi party playlist!

107
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,040
Bhang!

108
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,240
Chug, chug, chug.

109
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,960
Pooky Auntie.

110
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,120
Yes, darling?

111
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,320
Where are you going?

112
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,720
I'm just going inside.

113
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,640
I also want to come.

114
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,480
Arya is obsessed with the Khannas.

115
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,240
Who are the Khannas?

116
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,440
Some new TV show?

117
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,760
Cut off TV privileges like my Mom used to.

118
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,760
Girls, the Khannas? Varun, Kavya, Arav?

119
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,280
Oh, shit!

120
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,400
She wants to spend all her time with them.

121
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,520
Why do you think we are here?

122
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,480
She threw a mega fucking tantrum.

123
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,880
"I wanna play Holi with Arav.

124
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,440
"We're a family."

125
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,760
Blah, blah, blah.

126
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,840
Making fun of your own kid! Love it!

127
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,280
Love it!

128
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,880
It's not about the family.
it's about Arav.

129
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:46,040
She just likes being a big sister
and have a baby to play with.

130
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,840
And she knows that hanging out
too much with Varun is bad for her.

131
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,640
Mangs, Varun happens to be her father.

132
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,480
I know, poor baby.

133
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,200
Dance!

134
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,280
Everyone makes mistakes,
so you are forgiven.

135
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,960
If you want to make babies, there's Arjun.

136
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,520
Still the baby joke? Really?

137
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,240
We're not calling him a baby,
we're calling him to make babies!

138
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,720
-You should've spawned his babies.
-Yeah!

139
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,600
So lean, so fit, bro!

140
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,840
Such a hunk!

141
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,720
He must have good swimmers also.

142
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,000
One shot and boom! Congratulations!

143
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,520
All right, time up!

144
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,960
Will you shut up?

145
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,240
-Uncle, you get a glass.
-Thank you.

146
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,520
Auntie, you definitely need a glass.

147
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,120
Come back in five years. Nice try.

148
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,520
You look so hot right now.

149
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,680
Baby, you should try me in bed.

150
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,840
Worst pick-up line ever!

151
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,600
Hey, my pick-up lines
got you hook, line, and sinker.

152
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,560
But seriously, you should try me in bed.

153
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,720
So cute!

154
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,680
So coy!

155
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,560
So lovely!

156
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,000
All they need
is a strong glass of <i>chutzpah!</i>

157
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,800
I'll take that. Thank you.

158
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,920
Oh, my God, Sneha Auntie, I...

159
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,560
Oh, my God!

160
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,040
-And that's how it's done.
-Oh, my God!

161
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,920
Hey, Jeh,

162
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,160
Siddhi's mom is really hot.

163
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,800
-Bro, you okay?
-Yeah.

164
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,840
Never felt better.

165
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,840
Later, mate.

166
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,800
In a while, crocodile.

167
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,960
-Down the hatch, girls!
-Yes!

168
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,320
I see a genuine smile
on Sneha's face after a long time.

169
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,680
Not everyone's happy about it.

170
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,080
Like who?

171
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,600
These pervy uncles
who just want to bring joy to her vagina.

172
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,920
And these bitchy aunties who want
her vagina to grow mold and fall off.

173
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,960
Ew.

174
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,240
You should've seen them.

175
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,720
All these horny uncles
were hovering around her.

176
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,800
And these angry, insecure aunties

177
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,560
were charging towards her
with horns on their heads.

178
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,120
And to think she wasn't even wearing red.

179
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,040
But I saw red everywhere.

180
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,400
Just doing stand-up here
or do you plan to get on stage too?

181
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,240
Yeah, you must miss it, Sids.

182
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,680
And you also need it, right?
For your own sanity?

183
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,160
It can be therapeutic.

184
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,080
Really? Can it bring my dad back?

185
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,480
Sorry!

186
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,440
It's okay.

187
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,000
But seriously, how is Sneha?

188
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,480
Beneath it all?

189
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,960
I hear her crying.

190
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,800
Sometimes locked in her bedroom
or in the bathroom or...

191
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,520
-And you?
-Me?

192
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,840
I cry everywhere.

193
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,520
Have you ever talked
to each other about it?

194
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,560
Let it be!

195
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,760
Come on! Let's get high.

196
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,200
Where's the bhang?
Is it out? I'll get some.

197
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,920
Okay, Arya. Come here!
You have to drink water.

198
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,480
Some more.

199
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,920
Wanna get high?

200
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,800
Okay.

201
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,520
-It's vodka golgappa!
-No!

202
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,520
-Come here!
-I'm not doing this!

203
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,040
Holi is the time for all things unholy!

204
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,000
Open your mouth. I'll tickle you!

205
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,000
Okay!

206
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,920
Raising a daughter with you was enough.

207
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,440
I thought I'd gotten away.

208
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,040
Never! No one can escape Varun!

209
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,320
Remember that time
we were in Delhi for Holi?

210
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,520
Bhatia's party!
At that gigantic Chhatarpur farm.

211
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,000
We couldn't find the place. We were lost.

212
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,760
And we shouldn't have.
You were trashed! You slept!

213
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,680
In the bushes!

214
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,480
And then Bhatia Uncle sent the cops

215
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,160
to try and find me.

216
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,840
Remember that time in Hampi?

217
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,160
Don't remind me of that.

218
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,880
I was hallucinating for two fucking days!

219
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,320
Remember that time
you were in the water tank?

220
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,520
I was trying to pull you out.

221
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,920
-I was like...
-Okay.

222
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,960
Okay, Varun, stop. Stop doing this.

223
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,320
Doing what?

224
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,760
Stop being nostalgic.
We messed it up once.

225
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,760
I don't want to get into it again.

226
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,480
Vodka golgappa!

227
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,080
God, I love them!
But I'm still feeding Arav.

228
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,640
I guess next year?

229
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,680
What were you guys
discussing so animatedly?

230
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,680
-Nothing!
-Nothing!

231
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Nothing!

232
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,920
Anj...

233
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,920
What were you guys giggling about?

234
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,560
Oh, that.

235
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,360
I think just remembering old stuff.

236
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,800
We messed up once and kissed. I...

237
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,480
I don't know what he wants.

238
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,640
Sex closure.

239
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,720
Sex plus closure.

240
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,560
-Sex closure.
-Not in a million years.

241
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,480
I see that life was
less complicated when I wasn't doing it.

242
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,600
Someone should get some
because I ain't getting any.

243
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,880
Neither am I!

244
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,560
But there's Jeh and Dee.

245
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,280
Resident bunnies.

246
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,840
They'll do it for all of us.

247
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,280
Why so red?

248
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,120
-The gulaal?
-Liar!

249
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,760
Jeh and I...

250
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,120
We haven't been...

251
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,880
I...

252
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,680
haven't been able to do it

253
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,200
since the miscarriage.

254
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,920
Does he pressure you? I'll whoop his ass.

255
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,720
No, he's actually very patient
and understanding.

256
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,320
And not that he doesn't try
once in a while, but...

257
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,680
you know, no pressure.

258
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,880
I don't know what's wrong!

259
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,560
You know, every time we get going...

260
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,680
I get these flashes, okay, of...

261
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,440
of the pregnancy,

262
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,240
of the confusion.

263
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,160
You know, that hospital smell, that...

264
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,080
And I just go cold.

265
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,040
It'll take time, Dee.

266
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,320
But it's been so long already, right?

267
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,480
Has it?

268
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,800
Papa died the same day.

269
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,320
Am I over it?

270
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,960
And you'll hurt, Sids.

271
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,080
Both you and Dee.

272
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,680
And with time,
it's not going to be more or less,

273
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,800
it's just gonna be different.

274
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,280
Dee, can I say something?

275
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,680
I just feel that, after that trauma,
you and Jeh...

276
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,480
jumped too quickly into this whole thing.

277
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,440
Really?

278
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,000
Yeah.

279
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,080
She might have a point.

280
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,560
Hey, what's wrong?

281
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,080
Jeh.

282
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,880
I mean...

283
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,040
I...

284
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,320
Oh, gosh, I love your smell.

285
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,200
"Perspire by Jeh."
I should bottle and sell it.

286
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,800
"Home by Jeh."

287
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,520
You're my softest pillow.

288
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,000
My cocoon.

289
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,000
My safe spot.

290
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,200
You mean nuclear bunker?

291
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,760
I mean it.

292
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,280
Are you drunk or emotional?

293
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,320
Or emotional from drunkenness?

294
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,080
Maybe both?

295
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,320
Why so sad?

296
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,680
I'm broke.

297
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,000
We're all broke, dude.

298
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,760
Broke like ceramic vases.

299
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,320
But then, we get glued back together.

300
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,920
Like...

301
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,560
Like kintsugi.

302
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,880
Imperfectly beautiful.

303
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,880
Wow. That was deep.

304
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,440
Broke, not broken.

305
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,800
I don't have rent money.
I'll be homeless by end of the month.

306
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,320
Listen, move in with me!

307
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:30,560
Then, we'll be like sisters forever.
#SadSisters.

308
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,480
Banks won't give me a loan.

309
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,920
Can you get a loan for rent?

310
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,920
-For my studio.
-Where's your studio?

311
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,320
I don't have one, but I will one day.

312
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,560
Umami Fitness.

313
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,960
Umami.

314
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,480
A little sweet, a little sour,
a little bitter, all Umang.

315
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,560
-All me.
-Wow, Mang!

316
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,320
That's such a cool name! Umami.

317
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,080
Do you know any investors?

318
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,200
I do.

319
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,200
And she's awesome.

320
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,320
Me!

321
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,080
Papa's left me shitloads of money.

322
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,160
Just take some.

323
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,720
That's not what I meant.
I can't take money.

324
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,280
Listen, you won't be taking it.

325
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,760
It's gonna be an investment.

326
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,040
Plus, what's the point
of my privileged existence

327
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,320
if I can't help my BFF?

328
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,200
Nah.

329
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,800
Anyway, Mangs, we'll all die one day.

330
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,560
It's pointless. Just take it, take it all.

331
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,760
You know,

332
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,000
you can call it something else also.

333
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,240
Wasabi Fitness. Ask why.

334
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,800
Why?

335
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:55,800
Because you make people
cry with pain in your classes.

336
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,280
-Jeh?
-Yes?

337
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,120
We should...

338
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,600
We should move in together.

339
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,600
Drunk Damini had better not take
drunk decisions.

340
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,720
Now open your mouth.

341
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,800
We make so many plans in life.

342
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,040
And then suddenly,

343
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,640
one day we realize
there's no fucking meaning to anything!

344
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,120
Chill, dude, everything will be okay.

345
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,320
You could be walking on the street,

346
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,800
and get hit by a bus.

347
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,920
And then, suddenly, boom! That's it. Over!

348
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,600
Okay. Papa time joke. Papa joke time.

349
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,160
What do you call Batman
if he got hit by a bus?

350
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,880
What?

351
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,280
Flatman!

352
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,320
Sids, you're clearly not okay.

353
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,120
Dude, I'm fucking awesome!

354
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,040
I understand everything now.

355
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,400
I know the eternal truth of life.

356
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,880
Put me down.

357
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,240
Further.

358
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,360
Listen.

359
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,480
-Listen carefully, okay?
-Okay.

360
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:45,000
Life is shit and shit always falls apart.

361
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,280
Okay.

362
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,560
Not if you have enough fiber, but...

363
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,120
Dude, where's Anj and Dee?

364
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,240
They're probably dead, too. Just my luck.

365
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,080
Arya, take a bite quickly. Come.

366
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,360
Chew, chew.

367
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,760
I love curry rice
more than millet pancakes.

368
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,560
-Really?
-God, finally!

369
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,800
-Arya.
-Arav!

370
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,520
You doing okay, Anj?

371
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,200
Yeah. It's...

372
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,120
nice to see her with her baby brother.

373
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,120
I know.

374
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,560
She makes such a good big sister.

375
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,120
You know Varun
will always be Arya's dad first.

376
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,160
Arya, come, curry rice.

377
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,880
Mama, I got a boo-boo.

378
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,280
Oh, my God!

379
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,480
Let me kiss your boo-boo
and it's gonna be okay.

380
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,760
Pooky Auntie, you also kiss my boo-boo.

381
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,840
Okay, come.

382
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,360
-Dada will also kiss your boo-boo.
-Yeah.

383
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,600
And one kissy-kissy for my...

384
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,960
-Okay.
-...baby mama.

385
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,200
Do kissy-kissy with Mama also.

386
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,280
Darling?

387
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,920
No.

388
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,200
Of course.

389
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,920
No, not like that.
Like you did with Pooky Auntie.

390
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,280
Darling. Mama and Dada are divorced.

391
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,680
I explained it to you.

392
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,000
We can't do that, okay?

393
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,880
You can. I saw you doing
kissy-kissy on the lips.

394
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,560
Arya, stop making up things, okay?

395
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,160
You're watching a lot of nonsense on TV!
Let's go.

396
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:51,040
No TV. In the kitchen,
I saw you doing kissy-kissy on the lips.

397
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,920
Sneha!

398
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,640
Sneha!

399
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,480
I love you, Mummy! I love you!

400
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,200
What?

401
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,600
When you were little, right?

402
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,960
When you were little.

403
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,520
No, when Dada used to sleep on the sofa.

404
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,000
That...

405
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,240
That night when you were
too drunk to come home?

406
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,840
When I was six months pregnant

407
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:32,600
and you were partying with you ex-wife
and her friends? That night?

408
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,600
Thanks, Anj.

409
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,920
Thanks a lot.

410
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,960
Kavya, there's
nothing going on between us.

411
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,800
Did you and Varun kiss or not?

412
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,800
Did you?

413
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,400
-Did you?
-Yes.

414
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,400
Get out.

415
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,160
-Kavs...
-No, get the hell out!

416
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,000
-Baby, it's a bit of an overreaction.
-Overreaction?

417
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,320
I knew something happened,

418
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,520
but I kept saying Varun can't do this,
and more than that,

419
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,200
Anj can't do this to me!

420
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,000
Kav, no.

421
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,760
But I was wrong. I was so goddamn wrong.

422
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,960
Do kissy-kissy with me, Mangs.

423
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,800
Open the door, dude.

424
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,600
This okay?

425
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,760
There you go.

426
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,800
I'm really worried about Siddhi.

427
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,760
After Viju,

428
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,960
Siddhi isn't herself anymore.

429
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,240
You aren't yourself either.

430
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,440
We can all see that.

431
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,400
We're both drowning, dear.

432
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:48,240
We're just clinging to each other
and trying to stay afloat.

433
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,560
But we're both drowning.

434
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,280
Have you talked?

435
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,480
Don't protect each other from the pain.

436
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,360
Talk.

437
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,960
I can't do that.

438
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,800
I'll end up needing her
to take care of me.

439
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,560
I can't do that to Siddhi.

440
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,200
We should have told Kavya that very day.

441
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:58,160
We agreed not to because
she was pregnant and it'd hurt her.

442
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,760
Yeah, but now it's worse.

443
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,080
So, it's my fault now?

444
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,840
No.

445
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,160
As usual, it's my fault.

446
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,480
Dee.

447
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,360
Good night.

448
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,720
Move in with me?

449
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,560
It's safe here.

450
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,880
Jeh, wait.

451
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,720
This is the only key I have on me.
The spare is inside.

452
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,400
Does that mean I have to come
and open the door?

453
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,320
Yes.

454
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,640
And then?

455
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,680
And then you stay.

456
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,080
