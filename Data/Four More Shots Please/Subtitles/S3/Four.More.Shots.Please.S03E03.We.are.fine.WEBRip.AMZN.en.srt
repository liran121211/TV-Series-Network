1
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,600
<i>I'm fine. You're fine. We all are fine.</i>

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,120
<i>But no one reads
the fine print under this "fine."</i>

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,720
<i>If we ever actually gave
an honest answer to "How are you?"</i>

4
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,800
<i>You think
the world will be fine with that?</i>

5
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,040
Mangs.

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,560
Mangs.

7
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,320
-Umang! Wake up, wake up!
-What happened?

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,400
-Rise and shine!
-Oh, my God!

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,240
What a bright, sunny day!

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,880
Wake up. It's 10:00 am.

11
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,760
Sids, my goodness!
Did you take uppers or something?

12
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,640
My life is an upper, Mangs!

13
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,200
Now we need to upper up. We have to leave.

14
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,960
-What's going on? Are you kicking me out?
-Never.

15
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,880
You forgot? We have to meet brokers.

16
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,600
Hey, what broker, man?

17
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,520
Brokers are people
who show us properties and all.

18
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,440
-Thanks.
-For your studio, silly.

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,400
Oh, my goodness.
Okay. Sids, that takes money.

20
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,560
Which I don't have. Okay?

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,080
You forgot, didn't you?

22
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,640
Last night, you and I
became business partners!

23
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,080
No. Sids, you offered it very sweetly,

24
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,040
but I didn't accept your offer,

25
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,840
because you can't jump
into something like this.

26
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,960
I'm not jumping into anything, I'm not!

27
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,080
Okay. I'm not jumping
into anything, I promise.

28
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,640
We'll make proper business plans, okay?

29
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,240
Like, actual Excel sheets
and Word documents and everything.

30
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,160
My lawyers will sort out everything.

31
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,840
We'll do whatever you say.

32
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,440
And we'll do this
very professionally, I promise.

33
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,960
Mangs, we're gonna be partners!

34
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,240
I'm gonna be an entrepreneur!

35
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,120
From BFFs to Boss Babes. Come on!

36
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,960
Yeah!

37
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,400
Okay, what should I wear?
I'm thinking, like, a power suit.

38
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,160
Like trousers and blazer.
I'll ask Mom if she has...

39
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,360
Kavya?

40
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,000
I emptied a closet.

41
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,040
-Spring cleaning?
-For you.

42
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,480
Great.

43
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,880
Great.

44
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,200
So,

45
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,200
when are you moving in?

46
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,640
-Fuck!
-What?

47
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,480
Sorry, this email.

48
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,400
Ayaz, my lawyer.
A notice from the civic authorities.

49
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,640
"Illegal building codes in Truck?"
What nonsense!

50
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,640
I'm sorry, I have to take this call.

51
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,760
Hello, Ayaz?

52
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,280
Thank you.

53
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,360
Why are Dada's clothes over there?

54
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,000
Because Dada has to take them
to the cleaners.

55
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,080
But they're clean.

56
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,800
When are we meeting Baby Arav?

57
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,280
I don't know.

58
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,120
Tomorrow?

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,440
I don't know.

60
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,160
Are Dada and Kavya Auntie
also getting divorced?

61
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,440
Don't worry, Dada.

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,200
I'll explain to Baby Arav

63
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,480
that from now on, he will also get
two presents on birthdays and Diwali.

64
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,080
I will also get two presents, right?
If Dada stays here?

65
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,800
You will. Okay, Mama has to go to work.

66
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,600
You have a good day, okay?

67
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,240
And Mama loves you. Bye.

68
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,240
This is perfect.

69
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,520
Ma'am, it's the best.

70
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,640
Bigger.

71
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,920
I want bigger.

72
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,680
Sids, we need a studio,
not an airport. It should be personal.

73
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,920
Yeah, but personal doesn't mean small.

74
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,760
Make it bigger. Much bigger.

75
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,920
Come on.

76
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,200
Excuse me.

77
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,200
This is perfect!

78
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,800
It's like a shopping mall.
It's so cold. Huge.

79
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,160
-Commercial.
-Enter interior designer!

80
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,640
We'll take it.

81
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,120
Ma'am, there's one more place.

82
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,280
Old Art Deco bungalow. It has character.

83
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,560
No need!

84
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,960
Sids, what's the harm in taking a look?

85
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,520
-Please?
-Fine!

86
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,320
This way, ma'am. Please come.

87
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,760
Please.

88
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,880
It's just a pigeon.

89
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,280
A pigeon.

90
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,920
-I love it.
-I hate it.

91
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,240
What's not to love? Look at this place.

92
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,560
It's so interesting.

93
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,000
It's completely run-down
and so down-market.

94
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,560
And why does it look like a haunted house?

95
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,040
Mangs, we need a youthful vibe, okay?

96
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,120
This is so not our image.

97
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,160
Cancel!

98
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,840
Madam likes the studio
she saw in the morning. Finalize that...

99
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,320
Sids, first off, the other place
is too expensive. Secondly...

100
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,160
Expensive is fine.
It means I have great taste.

101
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,760
And secondly, I don't like it.
I like this place.

102
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,160
Oh, God, Mangs. Trust me.

103
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm saving you
from making a huge mistake, okay?

104
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,120
We're taking the bigger studio.

105
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,840
You are bulldozing me.

106
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,520
It's called helping.

107
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,880
I think it's called "being bossy."

108
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,640
I'm not being bossy.

109
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,080
I'm being entrepreneurial.

110
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,440
There's a difference.

111
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,720
We should take a break.

112
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,040
Because of this heat, my brain is melting.

113
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,040
So, whenever you guys are ready...

114
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,320
-I think...
-I think...

115
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,400
-Please go ahead.
-After you.

116
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,200
-No, please, go ahead.
-I insist.

117
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,600
Okay, very well.

118
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,480
I think, right now, the best course
of action would be a mediation

119
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,440
to arrive at a consensus
between both the parties.

120
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,520
But we should file
for an ex parte injunction.

121
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,920
-It'll work better.
-Guys.

122
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,360
-How's it going?
-Mayank.

123
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,520
Thank God you're here.

124
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,120
Clients want Shashank
and Anjana together as a team.

125
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,440
Whatever's going on, solve it...

126
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,080
There are no issues, Mayank.

127
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,800
-None at all.
-It's not true.

128
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,760
Pretorus and Nair have already
taken their business to Dhyanchand.

129
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,960
Gateway Tech is threatening us.

130
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,040
It's not possible.

131
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,000
I met them. It went really well.

132
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,760
Really? They met me after that.

133
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,280
They were asking for Anjana.

134
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,040
They're her old clients. They'll ask.

135
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,920
I don't know how you guys do this.

136
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,320
We can't lose clients like that.

137
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,880
-I'm always there for my clients.
-As am I.

138
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,720
-I'm trying my best.
-As am I.

139
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,640
I don't know what's up with Mangs.

140
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,560
She's being so rigid of late.

141
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,120
Mommy!

142
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,880
I'm talking to you.

143
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,800
Don't ask me. Ask her.

144
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,440
Talk to her. She's your best friend.

145
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,040
"Best friend" should be like Viju!

146
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,880
Manohar.

147
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,240
Sneha. How are you, darling?

148
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,520
I think of you every day.

149
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,160
The sadness in your eyes.

150
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,280
It really haunts me, you know.

151
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,000
A touch of Meena Kumari.

152
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,040
A touch of Madhubala.

153
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,000
Your feet...

154
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,960
Don't let them touch the ground.

155
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,240
They'll get dirty.

156
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,240
You don't need to do that.

157
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,520
I really miss Viju.

158
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,520
Let's meet for coffee?

159
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,240
-Why is he putting a shoe on my feet?
-Because you are Cinderella.

160
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,000
He was clearly flirting with you!

161
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,040
Don't be ridiculous, Siddhi.

162
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,040
Viju and Manohar go way back.
They were close friends.

163
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,480
He would never do that!

164
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,280
Obviously, he misses him just like us.

165
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,520
Yeah. Shall we?

166
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,200
Now you can let your feet
touch the ground, Mama.

167
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,640
Ever wonder what's the point of all this?

168
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,120
Of what? Clearing the dishes?

169
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,400
Marriage, kids, family.

170
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,000
I mean,

171
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,640
in the end, we all die alone.

172
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,840
Unless you die in a plane crash
with 150 people.

173
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,160
I'm serious, Anj.

174
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,480
But why would you die alone?

175
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,120
You'll have Arya and Arav.

176
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,840
So, Kavs and you won't be?

177
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,360
What if I die first?

178
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,240
Exactly! There are no guarantees in life.

179
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,520
And yet we just keep giving,
and we keep sacrificing.

180
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,160
Guarantees are for fridges.

181
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,320
You know what?

182
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,600
Everybody should just be single.

183
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,840
Just fuck who and when they please.

184
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,880
Okay, enough whining.

185
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,600
While we were married, you never took
your responsibilities seriously.

186
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,080
And you're doing the same thing right now.

187
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,040
Your problem remains the same.

188
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,240
Repetitive and just self-made.

189
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,640
And end of discussion, please.

190
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,760
I have enough shit going on in my life.

191
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,960
Shashank's vow of silence with me,
his silent mind games and...

192
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,800
vibes colder than the North Pole...

193
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,800
Now see, that is also self-made.

194
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,680
Like, you chose to fuck him.

195
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,320
-Fuck off.
-Gladly.

196
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,160
Masturbate alone, die alone.

197
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,760
-That's my mantra from today.
-Not on my sofa!

198
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,560
You're gross!

199
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,320
Please bring the bags upstairs.

200
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,320
Geeta!

201
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,280
-Hi!
-What a surprise!

202
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,880
How funny! We just met Manohar.

203
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,840
Stop making plans with my husband.

204
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,520
-What?
-After Viju...

205
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,120
God rest his soul,
you have been on this manhunt!

206
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,040
You think we are all blind?

207
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,160
Nobody liked you, anyway.

208
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,880
Keep your filthy paws off my husband.

209
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,120
Wait a second, Geeta Auntie. Relax.

210
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,880
My mom did nothing wrong.

211
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,360
In fact,
your pervert husband came and held her,

212
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,320
told her how beautiful she looked,

213
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,760
that he missed my papa a lot

214
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,320
and then he invited Mama for coffee.

215
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:12,120
He started caressing her feet and called
her Madhubala, Meena Kumari or something.

216
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,560
So, next time, before you accuse my mom,

217
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,480
tell your shitty husband
to keep his filthy paws off her.

218
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,640
And one more thing.

219
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,720
If you hadn't ostracized her,
you would have realized

220
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,760
just how lost, sad
and frightened she actually is.

221
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,280
Real queens fix
each other's crowns, Geeta Auntie.

222
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,760
And we don't say it just on social media,
we do it in real life, too.

223
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,200
My girlfriends are my biggest strength.

224
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,000
And honestly,
you should bloody be ashamed of yourself.

225
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,720
Mama!

226
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,640
Mama!

227
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,960
Mommy!

228
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,280
Please let me in.

229
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,960
Mommy, open the door, please!

230
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,240
I'm fine, Siddhi!

231
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,040
I'm coming. I'm coming.

232
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,240
I'm fine! I'm fine.

233
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,320
We have to be strong together.

234
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,080
Yeah.

235
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,400
And next time,
don't hide your tears from me.

236
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,680
Talk to me. Cry with me.

237
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,200
I will, darling. I will.

238
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,240
I'm the only one who gets it.

239
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,360
I'm the only one who gets it.

240
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,840
There's biomedical waste here.

241
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,960
Madhav, take a good shot.

242
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,040
I hate this job.

243
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,400
Miss Rizvi Roy.

244
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,760
Trying to save the world
one scrap at a time?

245
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,920
Mr. Dhananjay Deshpande.

246
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,960
The new poster boy of the old party. Wow!

247
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,280
There's no hiding.

248
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,040
Can't say the same thing
about your father.

249
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,760
This is the situation of his constituency.

250
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,080
Nobody has seen him since the elections.

251
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,000
He's busy raising voices in court.

252
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,280
That's why his attendance is 27%.

253
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,400
You know what?

254
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,520
If he cared about citizens' needs
more than partisan needs,

255
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,800
this place wouldn't be in this state.

256
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,480
Yeah, I guess you're right.

257
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,680
By the way,

258
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,280
I loved <i>Bloody February.</i>

259
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,560
I thought it was great.

260
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,120
Is that a compliment or a warning?

261
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,480
That the government is still watching me.

262
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,800
-Compliment.
-From political royalty?

263
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,320
I'm not worthy.

264
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,080
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

265
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,520
You know what your problem is?

266
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,840
You are a total hypocrite.

267
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,600
Last week you were chilling
on a beach in Ibiza.

268
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,840
Popping MDMA,
showing off your Gucci trunks,

269
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,720
fucking a model in a club bathroom.

270
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,160
And this week you're the heir apparent
to a political dynasty.

271
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,120
With your photo on every billboard.
"The new Deshpande on the block."

272
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,000
Same white shirt, chaste language,

273
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,800
Indian flag,
the same old game of "us versus them."

274
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,920
I feel sorry for this country
that you are its future.

275
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,640
Okay, wait a second.
My Insta is set to private.

276
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,920
Did you hack into it?

277
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,800
But if you must know,

278
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,080
last week I was in London,
at a SOAS reunion,

279
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,440
in my Brooks Brothers khakis,
and one Negroni at a private bar.

280
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,400
I did try my luck with a model,

281
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,920
but Zayn Malik showed up there,
so she rejected me.

282
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,280
But yes, hypocrisy is in my blood.

283
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,360
And we've been selling Deshpande
for the last four generations.

284
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,440
I'd recommend about a bucket
of soda bicarbonate for your outfit.

285
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,840
I'm a politician.
I know how to get rid of stains.

286
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,120
Damini, is that shit on you?

287
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,640
No, no! None of this is working!

288
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,320
Okay.

289
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,400
I need a really,
like, Zen space, you know.

290
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,240
Calm, mindful,

291
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,880
minimalist, feng shui.

292
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,520
And for the walls,

293
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,520
I need white and natural wood. And...

294
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,320
aromas of the forest.

295
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,640
-And some really soft...
-Whoa, okay.

296
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,680
Wait a second.
Is this a fitness studio or a spa?

297
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,160
What bullshit is this?

298
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,760
"Aromas of the forest"? What on earth?

299
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,320
Mangs, people love this kind of bullshit.

300
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,040
It's all about creating an image.

301
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,960
Umami won't just be a studio.

302
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,040
We're selling a lifestyle, a brand.

303
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,920
And then we launch an app,
some merch, maybe even a fashion line!

304
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,640
Just imagine.
T-shirts, track pants, bags, slippers.

305
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,160
All with Umami branding.

306
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,040
We'll see if you want to start...

307
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,560
Everyone out. Everyone out. Please.

308
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,280
-What?
-I want to talk to you.

309
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,880
We don't have two minutes!
We're on a time crunch, so chop-chop!

310
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,320
Okay. So, chop-chop.

311
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,520
All your ideas are ridiculous.

312
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:13,880
This is not a salon spa.
We're opening a fitness studio.

313
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,720
And you don't know
the first thing about it, dude.

314
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,960
I want an energetic space,

315
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,560
where people would enjoy sweating it out.

316
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,160
Not some, like, lah-di-da,
fast fashion, mani pedi,

317
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,320
aromas of the forest space, dude.

318
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,320
Mangs.

319
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,160
I say this with a lot of love, okay?

320
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,160
But this is why
your loan applications got rejected,

321
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,560
you know nothing about running a business.

322
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,560
And business is in my blood.

323
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,320
I know what I'm doing. Okay?

324
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,040
Plus, it's my money, so I think
I should get a say in how we spend this.

325
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,160
Right.

326
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,080
It's your money, your ideas,
so you take care of everything. Okay?

327
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,040
And train my clients as well, okay?
How about that?

328
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,960
Enjoy your "fragrances of the forest"
or whatever.

329
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,200
Mangs!

330
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,800
Umang...

331
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,040
It's so frustrating.
Varun hasn't changed at all.

332
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,560
He still finishes all the coffee.

333
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,160
He still leaves the toothpaste tube open.

334
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,320
He turned the bathroom into his office.

335
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,280
Forty-five minute dump
while answering calls, imagine.

336
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,000
You know you're no longer
married to him, right?

337
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,080
Yeah, obviously.

338
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,760
And you can ask him to leave.

339
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,240
Or Kavya might ask him
to leave indefinitely.

340
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,240
And then he'll live with you forever.

341
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,080
You, Arya and your teenage son, Varun.

342
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,240
Hey, girls! All good?

343
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,760
-Hey, Jeh.
-Jeh, I got your text.

344
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,520
Listen, five months to move in?

345
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,720
Isn't that too long? Can you do something?

346
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,320
Damini, let's talk about this later, okay?

347
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,560
Dee?

348
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,320
"Mangs is just a small towner
from Ludhiana."

349
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,520
Everyone wants to tell me
how to fucking live my life.

350
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,320
My family, Samara and now you!

351
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,400
About who I should love, my wedding,

352
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,440
studio, why do others dictate it?

353
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,800
I'm saving your ass.
We all know you're shit with numbers.

354
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,280
And you get to decide
that I am shit at numbers

355
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,080
and that you are saving my ass?

356
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,560
Wow! Bro, keep your money,
I don't need anyone's charity.

357
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,880
Whatever I've achieved thus far,
I've done it myself.

358
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,560
And I'll continue to do it.

359
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,480
Better than you were those bankers.

360
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,200
At least,
they didn't set my brain on fire.

361
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,080
Free piece of advice to everybody.

362
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:34,080
Never, and I mean never,
go into business with your best friends.

363
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,440
It screws up everything.

364
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,240
Fine!

365
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,800
What?

366
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,480
Sids, it's Umang's dream.
You have to let go.

367
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,760
You offered to help as a friend.

368
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,680
Why are you trying to be her boss?

369
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,560
I'm sorry.

370
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,960
I'm sorry, too.

371
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,480
I'll back off.

372
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,320
No, Sids,
I'll find another way. It's fine.

373
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,080
But, I'm saying I'll back off.

374
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,240
I'll return your money.
With interest. I promise.

375
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,480
No way!

376
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,800
It's not a loan. It's an investment.

377
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,640
In you and in your dreams.

378
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,560
Because I believe in you.

379
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,400
Thanks.

380
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,560
Don't thank me.

381
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,080
Then what should I say?

382
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,640
The real language of love.

383
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,040
Cussing.

384
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,720
Witch.

385
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,120
Bitch.

386
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,400
Dumbass.

387
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:03,960
What?

388
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,560
It means "two potties stuck up your bum."

389
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,320
I love you, too.

390
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,040
You don't like potty jokes?

391
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,680
No, no. They are the shit.

392
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,440
Dee, why are you being so needy?

393
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,040
Why do you keep asking Jeh,
"When are you moving in?"

394
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,120
Well, he told me that he will.

395
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,800
I'd just like to know when.

396
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,480
Sure, but...

397
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,320
you know
that's not gonna solve your problem.

398
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,160
Like trying to have a baby
to fix a marriage.

399
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,720
Well, that ain't happening.

400
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,520
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it that way.

401
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,000
All I'm saying is that

402
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,920
this isn't you.

403
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,600
Me?

404
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,240
What is "me," Anj?

405
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,480
Unemployed me?

406
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,320
Pregnant me?

407
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,120
Banned me. Trolled me.

408
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,360
Writer me.

409
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,680
Writing a thesis on garbage me.

410
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,360
I don't know anymore, Anj.

411
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,520
For the first time in my life,
nothing is in my control.

412
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,320
My body or my career. Nothing.

413
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:15,560
The only thing remotely functional
in my life is Jeh and me.

414
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,120
So I need to hold on to it, okay?

415
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,840
I need it.

416
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,520
Dee.

417
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,840
Look at me.

418
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,040
You do you, okay?

419
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,920
Everything will be fine.

420
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,600
Okay.

421
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,880
-Didn't you have to go to a meeting?
-Yeah, I do.

422
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,520
Everything will be fine, Anj.

423
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,560
Yeah.

424
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,320
I was thinking...

425
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,640
I'll spend the night at my place.

426
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,160
I have to sort out the notice issue.

427
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,480
You can do it from my place, too.

428
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,240
Yeah.

429
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,840
But...

430
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,040
I need my thinking spot.

431
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,200
Sure.

432
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,840
Come, I'll give you a ride.

433
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,680
No, I'll walk. It's a nice evening.

434
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,160
Bye.

435
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:59,000
Shashank, things must go back
to how they were.

436
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,000
Professionally?

437
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,440
Yes.

438
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,560
And how do you propose we do that?

439
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,840
Isn't law our passion?

440
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,960
Isn't it what makes us feel alive?

441
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,200
Gives us a reason
to wake up in the morning?

442
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:24,040
Everything else is a distraction.

443
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,560
You're right.

444
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,320
Let's work with each other, not against.

445
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,800
Exactly.

446
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,200
May I?

447
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,960
You're stalking me?

448
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,920
Yes. We need to talk.

449
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,880
About what?

450
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,600
Me.

451
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,160
I'm an honest guy, and I'm a fanboy.

452
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,720
Really?

453
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,200
Post your exit from Investigator,
I followed you on Twitter.

454
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,800
Loved your take on ballot box hack.
Amongst others.

455
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,960
"Amongst others"?

456
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,280
I can list them.

457
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,040
EVM hack. Housing scam. Sand mafia.

458
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,640
-I don't want compliments.
-Then what do you want?

459
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,440
Stories on potholes and garbage?

460
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,080
I'm still following them.

461
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,960
Why don't I see this honesty
in your politics?

462
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,720
Your party switches
from centrists, socialists and rightists.

463
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,720
You're right. We're coalition champions.

464
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,400
That's why I need you.

465
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,120
Need me?

466
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,800
Plan to sabotage the government?

467
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,280
I plan to make one.

468
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,400
Work with me. Help me run my campaign.

469
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,160
I want to create a new image,
different from the party line.

470
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,880
I wanna walk the hard-line.

471
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,920
-You're laughing?
-Did you miss the memo?

472
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,120
I'm persona non-grata
in all political circles.

473
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,840
Left, right, center, up, down.

474
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,600
My career is dead on arrival.

475
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,000
Big fucking deal.

476
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,520
What's with this loser attitude?

477
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,720
What happened to the firebrand
that was Damini Rizvi Roy?

478
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,160
Well, let me think.

479
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,040
I got thrown out of my own news site.

480
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:35,560
My book lead to nationwide protests,
so it got pulled back.

481
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,640
And, oh, wait. One more fuck up.

482
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,320
My baby also protested.

483
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,920
So, I had a miscarriage.

484
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,120
I'm...

485
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,120
I'm sorry.

486
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,480
I didn't know. Really sorry.

487
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,160
You just want
my left liberal followers. That's all.

488
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,280
Do you want to just write
about garbage or clean it up, too?

489
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:04,040
Our politics are further
than the North and the South Poles.

490
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,280
It's suicide.
Metaphorically and literally.

491
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,680
Not just for me,

492
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,120
but for you too.

493
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,080
So now, if you'll...

494
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,680
please excuse me.

495
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,760
Damini.

496
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,400
To change the system,
you have to be in it.

497
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,880
You can only RT
and comment from the outside.

498
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,000
This is your chance to make a difference.

499
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,880
Now the only thing left for you to ask is,

500
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,240
do you have the guts?

501
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,160
To take a chance on me.

502
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,920
On yourself.

503
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,880
Don't you miss having the fire inside you?

504
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,000
Don't you want it back?

505
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,920
This isn't healthy for Arya.

506
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,160
I know.

507
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,760
I just need a couple more days.

508
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,560
Just a couple more days, okay?

509
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,560
After that,

510
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,120
I don't know.

511
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,600
Beg, grovel, apologize,
do whatever you have to, just...

512
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,080
Make up with Kavya, please.

513
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,800
Or Varun, just...

514
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,200
Just find a place of your own.

515
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,800
Arya needs routine, stability.

516
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,480
What if she gets used to living with you?

517
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,320
I get it.

518
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,520
<i>That's the notion of perfect beauty.</i>

519
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,680
<i>So now when people ask me,
"Hey, Siddhi. What's up?"</i>

520
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,000
<i>I just tell them, "My self-esteem."</i>

521
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,040
