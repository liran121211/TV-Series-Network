00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,640
<i>When there is a spark,
must there always be a fire?</i>

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,320
<i>Actually, it depends
on what kind of night it is.</i>

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,640
<i>If it's a still one,</i>

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,040
<i>spark gets easily snuffed out.</i>

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,800
<i>But if it's one with a turbulent wind,</i>

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,120
<i>watch out for the burning forest fire.</i>

7
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,680
Hello!

8
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,000
My... Wow!

9
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,920
-What the hell!
-Amazing, guys!

10
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,360
Speech!

11
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,080
Thank you, guys!

12
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,400
-Okay, I'm gonna sit for this.
-I'll oblige.

13
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,120
Okay.

14
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,800
It was always my dream
to one day move to Bombay,

15
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,560
and to find my place in the world here.

16
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,040
And finally, after five years,

17
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,960
I found my place today.

18
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,360
A place where I don't have to
fit into any molds,

19
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,480
a place which I can call my own.

20
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,560
Umami, my fitness studio.

21
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,320
-So proud!
-Well done, Umang.

22
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:08,880
All this would not be possible
without my three beautiful witches.

23
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,400
-Yeah!
-I'll never forget

24
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,360
that we met the first day
that I moved to the city.

25
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,320
You guys are my lifelines.

26
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,880
-I love you.
-Love you, too.

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,840
Thank you.

28
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:26,320
A special thanks to Sids, my baby girl.

29
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,400
This is gonna sound cheesy,

30
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,600
but you are the petrol
that fuels this car.

31
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,720
And I can't thank you enough.

32
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,280
We love you too, Mangs.

33
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm getting in on the hug!

34
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,080
Yeah, I'll send it in 15 minutes.
Yeah. Okay, thanks.

35
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,280
-When was the mezzanine floor constructed?
-2014.

36
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,720
2014... Show me the permission letter.

37
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,280
What the fuck, Jeh?

38
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,360
What's the problem?

39
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,560
Don't you like my house?

40
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,560
Is it too small for you?
You can tell me, you know?

41
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,560
Is it about sex?

42
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,080
-Aren't happy with me?
-Damini.

43
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,040
Do you wanna see other people?

44
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,760
Can we discuss this later?

45
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,200
MAHARASHTRA GOVERNMENT

46
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,240
What is it, Jeh?

48
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,680
This round and round merry-go-round
is just getting to my head.

49
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,760
Are you moving in or not? Just tell me.

50
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,680
-You don't wanna move in?
-No.

51
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,760
I just need to sort this out
with the municipal authorities.

52
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,240
And I stay over at your place
three nights a week anyway.

53
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,160
-We are practically living together.
-It's not the same thing, Jeh.

54
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,920
Damini, I'm tired of explaining myself.

55
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,360
Why did you return the key?

56
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,680
I was keeping it safe.

57
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,320
Look, I want to move in.

58
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,800
Okay? I promise.

59
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,480
Okay, darling, you have a great day.

60
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,800
And the tomatoes from the sandwiches
mustn't come back, okay?

61
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,520
-Love you.
-Dada's hug.

62
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,720
Bye, baby.

63
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,000
Okay, I'm gonna go. I'll see...

64
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,920
Can you drop me off at home?

65
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,680
I mean, to Kavya's.

66
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,560
Yeah, sure.

67
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,720
Come, let's go.

68
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,040
So, at Umami,
we focus on personal training.

69
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,320
-It's quality over quantity.
-Got it.

70
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,520
Also, you have celebrity clients, right?

71
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,600
Do you have any?

72
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,320
I met Ranveer Singh once,
during an audition.

73
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,280
-Was he auditioning?
-No.

74
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,320
I was auditioning.

75
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,640
Do you want to be an actor or a trainer?

76
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,960
I want to be a trainer,
until I make it as an actor.

77
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,360
Good luck with that.

78
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,840
-Thanks, Anj.
-Bye.

79
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,640
Sir!

80
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,920
Please, sir.

81
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,440
What's going on?
Why did you lock the gate?

82
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,080
You're not allowed in, sir.

83
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,320
What do mean?

84
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,400
Sir, madam's orders.

85
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,920
I can't enter my own home?

86
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,360
Sorry, sir.

87
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,360
Open the gate, or I'll call the secretary.

88
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,600
He already knows.

89
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,360
Open the gate!

90
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,800
Sir! You'll fall, sir!

91
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,040
Mr. Khanna, please, stop this circus!

92
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,920
Good morning to you as well.

93
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,080
-Call Mrs. Khanna.
-Please, get down!

94
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,960
You can call her from jail.

95
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,400
-You'll fall down!
-Shit!

96
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,080
-Kavya!
-Varun, stop it!

97
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,880
-You stop it!
-Why are you acting like a monkey?

98
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,360
Kavs, what's going on?

99
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,000
I can't even go into my own house?

100
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,320
We both own it, okay?

101
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,640
Exactly! Both of us.

102
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,440
You and me, both!

103
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,480
Look at you!

104
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,480
Look at you, you immature idiot!

105
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,400
Two marriages, two kids,
and you are still sitting on the fence.

106
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,640
Leave!

107
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,360
Just leave!

108
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,160
Varun.

109
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,840
Please, let's go.

110
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,920
Varun, let's go!

111
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,480
Come down.

112
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,560
Careful.

113
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,160
{\an8}Choose push-ups over push-up bras.

114
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,640
If you can't do it,
how will you get the clients to do it?

115
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,400
I'll do a couple to show them.

116
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,960
I'm unfollowing you.

117
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,360
Blocked you also. Thank you so much.

118
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,760
Hi.

119
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,640
I'm Sean. I'm here for the...

120
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,520
-Swimmer?
-State level.

121
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,320
-Couldn't make it to Nationals?
-I wasn't that good.

122
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,880
-Such honesty? Okay.
-What's true is true.

123
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,400
Actually, my trainer
and I started obsessing a bit

124
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,040
and pushed myself too hard,
tore my ligaments.

125
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,880
-So, you picked yoga.
-Yeah.

126
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,320
Not too light for you?

127
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,960
Actually, on the contrary,
it's quite difficult.

128
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,000
Yoga changes your body and your mind.

129
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,720
Don't you find
doing it every day monotonous?

130
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,640
Well...

131
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,000
that's how you become an expert. So...

132
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,720
Plus, now I don't have
to do 80 kilograms squats.

133
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,440
Fair enough. Okay.

134
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,760
Let's do this.

135
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,280
Three minute plank.

136
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,360
Let's go.

137
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,320
Could we make it two minutes
and 56 seconds please?

138
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,440
Because I've never crossed
two minutes and 57 seconds

139
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,520
and I don't wanna lose self-respect.

140
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,760
-All right.
-What?

141
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,960
Your truth bombs. I'm not used to them.

142
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,840
Should I keep going...

143
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,480
-You can get up.
-Okay.

144
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,520
Last question. Why yoga?

145
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,760
Because it is better
than being addicted to selfies,

146
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,080
or junk food, or alcohol, or drugs.

147
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,080
-You were an addict?
-Yeah.

148
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,640
What was your drug of choice?

149
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,760
Everything.

150
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,360
When I didn't get selected
for Nationals, I...

151
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,760
smoke, shoot, snort, pop, fuck, eat,

152
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,520
I mean, you name it, I did it.

153
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,240
Okay.

154
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,520
Welcome to Umami.

155
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,520
Break a leg.

156
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,200
Thanks.

157
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,600
Great.

158
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,600
<i>So, tell me, who is Dhananjay Deshpande?</i>

159
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,880
Why don't you tell me?

160
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:50,120
Four generations ago, your grandfather
was a well-known politician of India.

161
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,080
Then politics became your family business.

162
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,880
You're privileged. Entitled.

163
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,320
You don't date Indian women.

164
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,320
There was a girl,
from the royal family of Kewad, right?

165
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,160
You're so far removed from the real India.

166
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,840
Actually, you have no idea

167
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,800
about the day-to-day struggles
of a common man.

168
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,240
-Is that how you see me?
-That's how everyone here sees you.

169
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,200
That's not how I want to be seen.

170
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,120
Fair enough. So, you tell me.

171
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,120
In your opinion,
who is Dhananjay Deshpande?

172
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,520
Sometimes, his father's son,

173
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,640
or his grandfather's grandson.

174
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,560
A boy who went to an elite boarding school
in the hills.

175
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,520
Who saw his family
only in the summer vacations.

176
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,680
Who was bullied.

177
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,360
So, that boy had to pretend to be strong

178
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,440
and face those bullies.

179
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,640
And I think, I'm still that boy.

180
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,560
A boy pretending to be a man
who's pretending to be strong

181
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,000
and facing his bullies.

182
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,640
Who didn't want to be a politician,
but an architect.

183
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,520
I loved drawing.

184
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,600
I still do, in fact.

185
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,480
But all that said, now that I'm here,

186
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,480
I wanna do the best I can.

187
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,440
Because when the going gets tough,
I stick around.

188
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,400
It's an old habit.

189
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,160
Who do you see in the mirror?

190
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,480
I'm not a good son.

191
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,400
I just pretend to be.

192
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,960
I listen to my father
but I don't understand what he says.

193
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,000
Some of his party's decisions
leave me fuming.

194
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,320
What is his worst quality?

195
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,280
That he lives in an echo chamber.

196
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,800
He genuinely can't take criticism.

197
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,680
Whatever I am,
I'm willing and able to learn.

198
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,000
And I want to learn.

199
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,920
We can work with this.

200
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,040
New guard versus old guard.
It's always good.

201
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,320
Wow... I feel naked.

202
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,880
Stripped and whipped.

203
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,160
But today was good. Thank you.

204
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,080
I will take your leave.

205
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,560
Hey.

206
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,880
-Hey.
-I was just trying to call you.

207
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,160
I was passing by.
Thought I'd give you a ride.

208
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,080
Thanks.

209
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,600
-Dhananjay.
-Jeh.

210
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,960
-Pleasure.
-Same.

211
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,680
Jeh owns this bar at Kala Ghoda.

212
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,040
Truck Bar.

213
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,120
-I'd love to check it out sometime.
-Love to have you.

214
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,400
Actually, he just got served a notice
by municipal authorities

215
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,480
regarding some violations, you know?

216
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,640
And Jeh never violated any laws.

217
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,840
So, it just feels like
they are after him. You know?

218
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,960
I think I can help you out.
The mayor is a close family friend.

219
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,720
Thank you.

220
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,160
It's nice of you to offer,
but I'm taking care of it. Thanks.

221
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,720
Sure.

222
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,760
Let me know if you change your mind.

223
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:53,560
Mr. Khan, with this company, the right
thing would be to establish a precedent.

224
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:58,240
I was thinking,
let's go completely offensive on this one?

225
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,160
Honestly...

226
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,280
I don't care. I just want to win.

227
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,280
If the two of you decide on a strategy,

228
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,160
I think it would help the case.

229
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,120
Right.

230
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,600
So, let's do this,

231
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,640
start with an offensive argument,

232
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,920
and then we'll establish a precedent.

233
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,200
We do have all the ethical
and moral advantages.

234
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,720
There's no way they can win.

235
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,440
Mr. Khan, I say
we scare the shit out of them.

236
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,960
And then bury them in paperwork.

237
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,680
That sounds good.

238
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,040
All the very best.

239
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,400
Thank you.

240
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,160
Thank you, guys.

241
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,320
This means, we can still do it.

242
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,720
Like a team.

243
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,840
Let's go.

244
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,480
-Good job, Ms. Menon.
-You too, Mr. Bose.

245
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,960
I don't trust this guy.

246
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,040
Come on! I've got this.

247
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,600
Nothing's more important than work for me.

248
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,280
It says it's stand-up night tonight.
Shall we?

249
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,280
-Don't you miss it?
-I don't.

250
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,040
But look who's on the line-up.

251
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,760
Yeah, whatever.
He's just an ex. We're totally cool.

252
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,440
"Just an ex"?

253
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,920
How many exes do you have?

254
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,400
They keep coming back...

255
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,840
-Dude, Dr. Warsi?
-Where?

256
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,760
-"They keep coming back."
-So funny.

257
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,360
How fast do they "come"?

258
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,640
Hey.

259
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,760
What's up?

260
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,360
Hi.

261
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,320
I just wanted
to wish you luck on your set.

262
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,680
-Break a leg.
-Thanks.

263
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,760
So, everything okay?

264
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,960
Yeah.

265
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,040
Unless you're planning
on ruining something.

266
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,120
Why would you say that?

267
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,160
I shouldn't have.

268
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,200
I heard about your dad.

269
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,760
I wanted to call, but...

270
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,880
Sorry.

271
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,080
Thanks.

272
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,320
I just...

273
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,080
No hard feelings, I hope.

274
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,760
<i>Next up is Amit,
who needs no permit to be funny and brave.</i>

275
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,000
Thanks, man.

276
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,000
Hey, guys!

277
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,560
Hope everyone's having a fun evening.

278
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,960
-How you all feeling tonight?
-Great!

279
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,440
Nice. I wish I could say that, because...

280
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,520
I myself am feeling slightly weird.

281
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,080
-Why?
-Because...

282
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,480
Because I bumped into my ex
just before coming on stage.

283
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,680
Yeah. And when I asked her, "Why?"

284
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,560
She said, "I just wanna wish
you good luck for your set."

285
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,160
"Break a leg."

286
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,040
Knowing her, she might actually
want me to break my fucking leg, you know?

287
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:19,160
She happens to be this entitled,
privileged snob from SOBO,

288
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,480
who has nothing in common
with the people of the rest of the city.

289
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,320
You know the joke,

290
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,760
"Is Saki Naka in Japan?"
I think it's based on her.

291
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,320
When she left home to come to Bandra
and saw a rikshaw for the first time,

292
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,200
she was, like, "Hello, tuk-tuk."

293
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,720
She also had a problem with my flat.

294
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,040
But I don't really blame her for that.

295
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,320
I mean,
her bathroom's bigger than my house.

296
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,960
When she came over,

297
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,320
she saw the fan on the ceiling
and asked, "What is that?"

298
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,920
And I think, between me and the AC,
she probably chose the AC.

299
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,800
But you know what was worse
than the privilege?

300
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,280
It was the sex.

301
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,880
Like, she would just lie there,
like a pillow,

302
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,160
and fake an orgasm.

303
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,960
Like I was that naive.

304
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,880
She could've done some work.
It takes two, right?

305
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,880
And after all of this, in her head,

306
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,440
she's the victim.

307
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,040
Like, "People see me as a fat girl!"

308
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,960
I don't know,
maybe accept that you're fat,

309
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,080
get off the couch
and work out once in a while.

310
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,040
"My mommy doesn't love me!"

311
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,080
Boo-fucking-hoo, man! Who cares?

312
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,800
"I don't have a job!"
Maybe because you don't have any skills.

313
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,200
And then what genuinely hurt
was that she used me for her stand-up gigs

314
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,520
and she is the victim.

315
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,080
I'm anything but a victim!

316
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,040
Don't sit there and heckle me.

317
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,520
If you have something to say,
come onstage.

318
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,280
-Gladly.
-Yeah!

319
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,800
You were saying?

320
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,440
I said, I'm not a victim.

321
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,240
Guys, I don't know if you can tell,
but she's the ex.

322
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,280
And thank God for that. Right?

323
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,760
I mean, had I lived with such hate,
I would have died of toxicity by now.

324
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,960
Can you believe that? She broke my heart
and I can't even cry about it.

325
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,080
This isn't crying, Amit,

326
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,960
this was a personal attack.
This was hate speech.

327
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,040
Hate speech?

328
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,280
Clearly, somebody doesn't watch
the evening news. Right?

329
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,560
But tell me, seriously,
what did I do to deserve this end?

330
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,480
Okay, sure.

331
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,520
Where do I start?

332
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:42,640
Wait! I had to fake an orgasm,
because I had to protect your fragile ego.

333
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,920
That's what most women do, by the way.

334
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,560
Yes!

335
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,800
And I used to lie there like a pillow?

336
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,160
Really?

337
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,720
You never gave me enough time
to do anything.

338
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,800
Ever heard of that word...
What is it? "Foreplay"?

339
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,520
-Really?
-You know, he had a fixed sex set.

340
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,800
Like a comedy set.

341
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,400
Kiss-kiss, nibble-nibble, gobble-gobble,
ten seconds and done.

342
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,080
Every single time.

343
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,000
Guys, you know what time it is?

344
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,560
It's time for me to mention
Girlfriend-Gate.

345
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,800
I called her my girlfriend onstage,

346
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,000
she lost the fucking plot.

347
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,800
Yeah! That's normal. Right?

348
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,560
Before talking to each other,

349
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,040
he announced it
in front of a live audience of 150 people.

350
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:32,000
Because this is not real life,
it's a Bollywood movie, right?

351
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,080
Where you can point to me
and say, "That's my girl,"

352
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,400
and I would smile coyly.

353
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,640
You know, if we use the B-word
before they use the G-word,

354
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,800
then suddenly we are the clingy
and the needy ones.

355
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,320
And they're like,

356
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,040
"Bro, she's being too needy.
I need my space. I'm feeling suffocated."

357
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,880
And if they use the G-word,

358
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,560
then we should feel privileged
and obliged.

359
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,560
And if we don't want to be girlfriends,
or wives, or have any sort of labels,

360
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,480
then we're cold-hearted bitches.

361
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,240
I seriously suggest
that before you announce it to the world,

362
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,040
discuss among yourselves

363
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,840
whether you are in a fucking relationship.

364
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,120
And no, fucking is not a relationship.

365
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:22,040
Also, I never used you for my gigs.

366
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,200
You are the one who used me
as material for your gigs.

367
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,600
And still are.

368
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,560
Siddhi!

369
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,960
What the fuck was that?

370
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,200
Closure.

371
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,360
And I'm done talking.

372
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,080
Wow! That's mature.

373
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,320
I'm in therapy because of you.

374
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,560
Trust issues.

375
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,880
Okay, listen, aren't you going overboard?

376
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,400
We barely knew each other
for three months.

377
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,520
So you're gonna decide how I need to feel?

378
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,640
Does this fall under SOBO privileges?

379
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,080
You know, you're a horrible person.

380
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,120
Guess fucking what?

381
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,200
I'm not beans and rice,
I can't make everyone happy.

382
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,600
Great line!

383
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,440
You should use it in your set.

384
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,600
I will. And you'll buy
a ticket to watch me do it.

385
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,560
He hates me.

386
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,480
-And I'm ready to do stand-up again.
-Yes!

387
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,200
-That's my girl!
-You'll set the stage on fire!

388
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,200
{\an8}Tell me a story.

389
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,040
{\an8}-How about <i>The Hare and the Tortoise?</i>
-No.

390
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,680
When did you first fall in love?

391
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,000
Okay...

392
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,560
So, there was this girl, Stella,

393
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,000
she lived in Aldona in Goa,

394
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,680
near my grandparents' house.

395
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,560
She'd come to watch
my football matches everyday.

396
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,480
One day, I needed to pee very badly,
so I went behind the bushes.

397
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,960
Stella saw me,

398
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,200
and that bush dried up in a week.

399
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,800
Can you believe it?

400
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,520
Stella told everyone
that my pee poisoned the bushes.

401
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,520
And people started call me PP,
"Poisonous Penis."

402
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,960
Do you think that...

403
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:25,960
I think you have a poisonous penis
and that's why I'm not sleeping with you?

404
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,920
No! What? Are you crazy?

405
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,480
I'm crazy?

406
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,320
I'm crazy?

407
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,800
It's strange. Right?

408
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,880
You need time to move in and that's okay.

409
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,880
But I need time

410
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,760
to put everything that happened past me
and start having sex again

411
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,120
and that's not okay.

412
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,560
And I'm crazy?

413
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,240
What are you talking about, Damini?

414
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,000
I'm psycho both ways, right?

415
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,840
I'm the crazy one, Damini's the crazy one.

416
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,720
-Damini, "The Crazy," Rizvi Roy.
-What's going on?

417
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,600
First, you mention my problems
to that Dhananjay and now this?

418
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,880
"That Dhananjay"?

419
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,200
What?

420
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,040
Why bring him into this?

421
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,760
He was trying to help you.

422
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,680
Why discuss my business problems
with a stranger?

423
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,840
He's not a stranger.

424
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:18,240
Maybe for you, it's normal to get help
from people you met five minutes ago.

425
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,600
But I don't take favors from strangers.

426
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,520
So, do me a favor
and tell him not to take care of it.

427
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,200
And by the way,

428
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,040
I was connecting my story
to your pee girl story.

429
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,240
I was just trying to make you laugh.

430
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,160
I'm really nervous, okay?

431
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,400
<i>Everyone is there to learn, Mom.</i>

432
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,840
<i>No more doubts. Go forth and conquer.</i>

433
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,200
And it also looks like
it's a senior citizen's gathering.

434
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,640
-I hope I'm in the right place.
<i>-Mom!</i>

435
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,160
Love you. Bye.

436
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,120
Hello.

437
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,560
-Good morning, everyone.
-Good morning.

438
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,880
I'm your instructor, Rajan Malhotra.

439
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,640
So, let's start
with how to invest in the stock market.

440
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,560
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

441
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,880
I'm so sorry.

442
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,240
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

443
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,040
Shall I continue, Ms...

444
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,600
Mrs. Sneha Viju Patel.

445
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:48,760
-Yes. Please, continue.
-Thank you, Mrs. Sneha Viju Patel.

446
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,200
So, stock market...

447
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,080
In which stocks should we invest?

448
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,800
What should we chose?

449
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,480
Growth stocks? Yield stocks?

450
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,840
Large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap?

451
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,200
I'm really sorry.

452
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,640
You said, growth stocks, yield stocks...

453
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,920
-What did you say after...
-Don't worry.

454
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,920
This is just the orientation.
You can start the notes a little later.

455
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,600
Okay. Stocks.

456
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,000
What about new issues?

457
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,200
They definitely have short-term gains.

458
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:21,160
After all,
we're not exactly young anymore.

459
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,360
Except of course you, ma'am.

460
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,800
Old or young, short-term or long-term,

461
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,600
there's always risk in the market.

462
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,560
My husband used to say that.

463
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:41,240
And he passed away
suddenly at the age of 54.

464
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,520
So, one thing I know,

465
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,240
is that life has no guarantees.

466
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,600
And you're absolutely right.

467
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,680
There are none.
And absolutely not in the stock market.

468
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,120
So, on that note, can anyone tell me
what are blue chip stocks?

469
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,840
Anyone?

470
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,040
Any guesses?

471
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,880
Yeah, sure. Of course.

472
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,240
Blue chip stocks

473
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:26,200
are like a rich, entitled and old person.

474
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:29,120
You know,
the ones with expensive collections

475
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,520
of fine wines and cigars, worth millions.

476
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,360
Arrogant and slow,

477
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,480
but also trustworthy
and financially sound.

478
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:41,280
With time,
their value and reputation increase.

479
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,040
Absolutely brilliant.

480
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,200
With your permission,
may I use that in my next orientation?

481
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,240
-Sure.
-Thank you.

482
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,440
So, moving on.

483
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,280
Blue chip stocks...

484
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,360
Hi. Where are you?

485
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,200
I've been waiting.

486
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,240
Okay, I'll wait downstairs.

487
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,480
So, how long has it been?

488
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,520
Seven months.

489
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,600
Five years.

490
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,840
Does it get any easier?

491
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,120
I try every day.

492
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,760
Try to keep myself busy.

493
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,320
Work, workshop, travel.

494
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,240
You know what's most difficult?

495
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,120
Is it the mornings?

496
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,600
Yeah.

497
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:51,080
When I wake up in the morning,
my hand goes to the other pillow.

498
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,560
That's when you realize she's not there.

499
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:03,920
Twenty-seven years.
I don't know how to live without Viju.

500
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,000
You know, for me, she's still here.

501
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,120
In all the small things.

502
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,760
Morning breakfast,

503
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,640
sudoku in the newspaper,

504
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,680
or even a bad joke makes me realize
how much she would have laughed at it.

505
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,760
Or I might utter her favorite cuss word.

506
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,120
Or her favorite song plays on the radio.

507
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,200
Or you see them in your daughter's eyes.

508
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,840
Exactly. They are here.

509
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,880
Yeah, I think you're right.

510
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,560
My daughter, Siddhi.

511
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,200
Siddhi. Come
and meet my instructor, Rajan Malhotra.

512
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,000
Mama, it's getting late. Let's go.

513
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,640
-No problem.
-Come.

514
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,000
Siddhi?

515
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,560
Ms. Patel, pleasure.

516
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,320
Hello.

517
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,160
Siddhi?

518
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,200
Your mom is a great student.

519
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,280
Makes some brilliant analogies.

520
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,360
I'm sure.

521
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,720
I'll see you on Saturday.

522
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,120
Next class.

523
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,840
-See you. Bye.
-Bye.

524
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,480
Move.

525
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,080
It was a really excellent class.

526
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,680
Yeah, I can see that.

527
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,920
As in?

528
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,160
As in, paying special attention
to his special student.

529
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:44,520
-Siddhi, really?
-Seriously, Mommy?

530
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,320
You still doubt it
after Manohar's episode?

531
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,200
Let's go home, Raju.

532
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,840
Caramel!

533
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,840
-Wow!
-Hey, Caramel.

534
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,000
Hi, Caramel?

535
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,000
Is your name Caramel? Hi, Caramel.

536
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,120
Caramel, sit.

537
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:22,600
Actually, we're closed right now.
Can you come back tomorrow?

538
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,520
-No. We are just out on a walk.
-Hi.

539
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,360
I run this bakery down the road.

540
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:32,160
Caramel, she just barged in.
So, thought we would peep in.

541
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,960
Please, peep all you like then.

542
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,600
-You can come in.
-Thank you.

543
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,760
Come. Come on, Caramel.
Caramel, go inside.

544
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,640
-Thank you.
-No problem.

545
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,040
What great energy.

546
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,320
-I'm Meher, by the way.
-Umang.

547
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,640
Umang's Umami.

548
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,480
The fifth taste.

549
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,560
That words can't describe.

550
