-Cheers.

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,600

We came here to discuss my problems.

50
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,840
But as usual,
you've made it about yourselves.

51
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,840
It's my first relationship with a woman.
I'm not sure if I'm...

52
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,240
"If I'm..." what?

<i>An SOS call is all it took

Do you still like me?

69
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,240
Not the right time for this.

70
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,040
You want us to do shows.

71
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,360
We're a hit pair.

<i>From discovering hidden talents,

73
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,520
You like shaking things

74
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,120
or you're shaken up
because you shake things up?

75
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,200
Join me. As a senior partner, of course.

76
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,120
<i>Seriously.</i>

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,520
-Are you guys dating?
-Yes.

78
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,400
<i>It was also time
to give love another chance.</i>

79
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,720
-Will you marry me?
-Yes.

80
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,200
<i>But what is love</i>

81
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,080
<i>without a bit of drama?</i>

82
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm pregnant and it's yours.

83
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,760
-You're pregnant?
-It's not yours.

84
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,040
You need to leave.

85
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,360
What the hell!

86
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,960
I believed you.

87
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,960
Had you known,
would you have done things differently?

88
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,440
I never really doubted
that it's not an open marriage.

89
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,600
I can't be with someone who always
puts me second to everything else.

90
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,320
Umang!

91
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,360
There's nowhere else I would rather be,
no one else I'd rather be with.

92
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,200
I love you guys so much.

93
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,440
Papa.

94
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,360
What?

95
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,800
He's gone.

96
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,560
<i>Love makes your heart explode, but loss</i>

97
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,000
<i>makes it shatter into a million pieces.</i>

98
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,640
<i>Is there any way to protect your heart?</i>

99
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,680
<i>Maybe not.</i>

100
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,360
<i>Because you will always lose your love.</i>

101
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,400
<i>It's inevitable.</i>

102
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,440
My papa is...

103
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,040
was a wonderful,

104
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,040
kind, warm and a funny man.

105
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,320
And I was his Siddhi-Piddhi.

106
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,720
He loved Kishore Kumar's songs,

107
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,600
drinking vodka with me,

108
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,640
and his morning walks here
with his friends.

109
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,000
Like he would always say,

110
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,800
"All you need on a tough day is vodka."

111
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,120
And he loves me and my mom

112
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,160
more than anything else in the world.

113
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,760
Loved.

114
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,160
It's really weird
talking about him in past tense.

115
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,520
It feels like any minute
he's gonna walk in and say,

116
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,680
"Siddhi-Piddhi, want to hear a joke?"

117
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,880
And I really miss his WhatsApp jokes.

118
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,080
Terrible as they were.

119
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,880
His favorite bad one was,

120
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,960
"What are your plans this weekend?"

121
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,480
"Income tax returns."

122
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,960
"Oh, when was part one released?"

123
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,360
"How do Emirati babies cry?"

124
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,440
"UAE, UAE."

125
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,200
Say the one about the pencil.

126
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,600
"Why shouldn't we use a broken pencil?"

127
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,760
"Because it's pointless."

128
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,640
But you know what?

129
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,920
Papa's jokes might have been terrible,

130
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,360
but his enthusiasm was so infectious

131
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,000
that you would have
no choice but to laugh.

132
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,560
I miss you, Papa.

133
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,360
And I hope you're making
everyone laugh wherever you are.

134
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,920
Morning, beautiful.

135
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,080
Do we have to
do this obstacle course every day?

136
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,520
Garlic breath.

137
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,200
Why did you order
garlic chicken yesterday?

138
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,840
Because I know how much you love it.

139
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,720
Really?

140
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,120
What else do I love?

141
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:15,120
Umang, this is the sixth complaint
I've received about you from a client.

142
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,520
Any more and management will get involved.

143
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,600
He was talking nonsense, okay? About...

144
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,640
He was being an asshole.

145
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,840
All male clients want you to train them

146
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:30,200
because they think you'll give them
some juicy details about you and Samara.

147
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,720
What about female clients?

148
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,080
Female clients think you're single now

149
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,520
and you might hit on them.

150
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,520
Right. Because I'm a sex maniac
apparently, right?

151
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,960
I might jump on anyone I see.

152
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,840
I only have two clients, Anusha.
I need to make a living.

153
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,160
What do I do?

154
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,760
What do I do?

155
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,760
I'm so big. Why is he so small?

156
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,440
You were small, too, baby.

157
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,000
No, I was always a big girl.

158
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,360
No wonder Miss Vee Vee gave up after that.

159
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,440
-Oh, my God!
-Hi.

160
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,240
Traffic jam outside and fam jam inside.

161
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,640
High on emotions, just like your mama.

162
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,160
Okay, so you know what time it is?
It's family selfie time.

163
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,840
-Yeah!
-Come on.

164
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,400
Three, two, one, say cheese!

165
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,120
Only one of my eyes is visible.
I look like a one-eyed witch.

166
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,040
That's true. Let's do another one.

167
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,760
Give it to Anj. It's easier.

168
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,440
What an idea!
Wow, it's the idea of the day.

169
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,760
Please do the honors.

170
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,320
Yeah, sure.

171
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,840
Ready!

172
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,880
Family!

173
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,640
Okay, that's your picture.

174
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,520
At least it has both my eyes.

175
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,640
We're a family!

176
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,000
-Oh, don't cry.
-Don't cry.

177
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,360
Mr. Patel was one of our
oldest and biggest clients.

178
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,640
-We can diversify the portfolio...
-A focused portfolio.

179
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,640
Reducing the risk of diversification.

180
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,440
Real estate is the only way.

181
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,800
Confused?

182
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,960
Count on us.

183
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,160
We're here for you.

184
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,120
We'll make sure
that you never miss Mr. Patel again.

185
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,280
They swoop down like vultures
on vulnerable women.

186
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,840
We can do this, darling.

187
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,800
Just the two of us.

188
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,600
Not like we have a choice.

189
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,960
It's literally just the two of us.

190
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,520
Who knows what tomorrow has in store.

191
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,880
You could find someone really special.

192
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,120
-So could you.
-Don't be ridiculous.

193
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,920
And anyway, who wants a 48-year-old?

194
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,640
Other 48-year-olds
or 80-year-olds or 30-year-olds.

195
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,400
Mom, age is just a number.

196
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,720
So, either I change diapers
or someone changes mine.

197
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,760
That's your plan?

198
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,240
Anyway,

199
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,200
you know there's no room
in my heart for anyone but you

200
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,920
and your papa.

201
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,760
Shit, man!

202
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:21,000
...22, 23, 24!

203
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,200
Welcome to the moon.
We are here before Chandrayaan-2.

204
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,160
Take a close-up, Madhav.

205
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,680
How many more potholes do I need to click?

206
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,960
As many as we find.

207
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,400
There are 24 potholes
in this 1.5-kilometer stretch.

208
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,120
Some of them as huge as this.

209
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,080
Someone on a bike or auto
might end up dead here.

210
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,960
Let's measure it.

211
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,280
Well, we can only submit one photograph.

212
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,080
With space for just four lines of text,

213
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,280
with the ads for constipation
larger than the article.

214
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,760
We owe it to our readers.

215
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,320
All five of them?

216
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,840
Moving on.

217
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,840
Twenty-two foot spans

218
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:03,680
is 203.5 inches.

219
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,040
What?

220
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,760
You know your foot size in inches?

221
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,960
Don't you?

222
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,920
-Okay.
-No, no.

223
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,560
First woman on the moon.

224
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,040
Disgusting.

225
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,320
-Good morning.
-Morning.

226
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,160
Ask for an injunction.

227
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,080
Defendant doesn't want
the plaintiff to take...

228
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,640
I've a 2:00 p.m. booking for this room.

229
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,240
The Gateway Tech meeting?

230
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,280
I should be here too, right?

231
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,360
No, I got this one.

232
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,080
Okay.

233
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,600
Aadil, let's go.

234
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,120
Negotiations take time, Mr. Sethi.

235
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,520
The other side is just playing hardball.

236
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,600
Give us some time.
I'll get you a better offer.

237
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,440
So, Shashank,

238
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,440
what do you think?

239
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,240
Ms. Menon knows best.
She always knows best.

240
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,920
Okay, then let's take this forward.

241
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,600
Sure, let's do that.

242
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,520
Thanks for coming. I'll see you out.

243
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,840
Thank you, Mr. Sethi.

244
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,520
Yes?

245
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,640
What was that?

246
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,680
What do you mean?

247
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,560
What you said to Mr. Sethi.

248
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,160
"Ms. Menon knows best.
She always knows best."

249
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,320
It's true, isn't it?

250
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,000
That's why I...
I mean, this firm hired you.

251
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,120
Anything else?

252
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,320
No.

253
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,080
Keshav, how many malaria cases were
reported in the first quarter this year?

254
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,600
Okay. Dengue? Chikungunya?

255
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,760
-Thank you.
-Hey!

256
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,600
You're Damini Rizvi Roy, right?

257
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,560
-Yeah.
-I've read your <i>Bloody February.</i>

258
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,040
Before it got banned, of course.

259
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,040
Technically, it was not banned,
it got pulled out because of protests.

260
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,640
I think the protest
did the world a huge favor.

261
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,080
It was a 400-page tome of lies

262
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,160
and now it lies in the tomb.

263
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,680
-Excuse me?
-That's what people like you deserve.

264
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,080
You deserve this.

265
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,560
This world has gone crazy, hasn't it?

266
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,760
When we go from "people like us"
to "people like you"?

267
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,160
These days, everyone gets
offended about everything.

268
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,800
If I said this a little louder,
people here will get offended.

269
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,320
And that Kulkarni won't even
let me do an op-ed.

270
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,760
For the last five months,

271
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,640
I've been covering dengue,
malaria, mosquitoes and potholes, Jeh.

272
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,320
And you know me, Jeh.
I'm doing that diligently, too.

273
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,680
But till when?
How long will I be punished?

274
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,240
Till when do I have to
keep proving myself?

275
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,480
By the way,

276
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,920
I'm surprised she survived.
How did she survive that look of yours?

277
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,800
Which look?

278
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,640
I don't do that.

279
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,480
You're confusing me with one of your exes.

280
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,920
Damini Rizvi Roy, you are a fighter.

281
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,040
So fight the good fight.

282
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,920
<i>Yeah, this is Siddhi.</i>

283
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,960
For a show? No, I quit stand-up.

284
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,800
Indefinitely.

285
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,320
Yeah, please don't call me.

286
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,200
-Hey.
-Hi.

287
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,320
Why are you upset?

288
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,440
-Telemarketers.
-God, I hate them all.

289
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,720
Say hello to little Miss Sex Maniac.

290
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,640
-What?
-What?

291
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,960
Coming up,
there are three types of people.

292
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,000
#LearnitfromMangs

293
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,880
{\an8}First, the ones who are having sex.

294
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,760
{\an8}Second, the ones who want to have sex.

295
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,160
{\an8}And third, the ones who want to escape it.

296
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,760
And which one of these are you, Ms. Mangs?

297
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,040
All of these, at the same time.

298
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,640
Hugs and kisses!

299
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,280
So much love! I'm gonna cry.

300
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,320
We haven't met since morning.

301
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,080
-Oh, my God.
-You haven't met me either, Jeh.

302
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,160
Where's my kiss?

303
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,320
Aren't you my best friend?
Where's my kiss?

304
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,280
Just to remind all of you,

305
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,440
I'm why you started coming here.

306
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,640
And if not for me,
you would've never hooked up with Dee.

307
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,240
So, where is my kiss?

308
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,200
-Kisses! Kisses!
-I have customers.

309
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,760
-Go upstairs.
-Drinks.

310
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,280
One more! One more!

311
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,800
Going, ta-da!

312
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,800
What is with girls and their papas?

313
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,760
They are our biggest heroes.

314
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,080
Varun is not just Arya's hero,
but her superhero.

315
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,200
Maybe because
they are the first man every girl loves.

316
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,880
But by that logic,

317
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,880
mothers should also be our heroes.
They're the first women we love.

318
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,880
I think for me,
both my parents were my heroes.

319
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,440
I just want to be like them.

320
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,800
Fierce, brave, have an independent voice.

321
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,080
Take a stand every single day
just like they did.

322
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,920
I had an okay relationship with my father.

323
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,800
Neither attached nor detached.

324
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,680
He got transferred
from one tea estate to another.

325
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,240
And I would see him
only during my boarding school holidays.

326
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,680
Just two different worlds.

327
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,800
I know what you mean.
You know you love them.

328
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,880
They love you, of course.
You have each other's backs.

329
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,040
But it's like a missing link. Isn't it?

330
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,880
My father

331
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,320
is big-hearted, hardworking, honest.

332
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,680
But he's stuck in his idea of being a man.

333
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,960
And I always fought for his attention.

334
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:17,760
I'd play hockey, and lift weights.
I won so many medals

335
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:22,280
in the hope of proving myself
a better son than my brother.

336
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,200
And he actually said to me that,

337
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,320
"You can never be a sportsman

338
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,800
"because 'sportsman' has 'man' in it
and you aren't one."

339
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,880
You've never had
an emotional relationship with him?

340
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,920
You know, on my 22nd birthday,

341
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,320
I was presented an album
from a marriage bureau.

342
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,320
And he was like, "Choose one of them.

343
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,560
"You have to get married."

344
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,240
Honestly, he couldn't care less
about me. That's how I felt.

345
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,800
God, that's hard.

346
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:01,160
This one time, he was like,

347
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,960
"I love you a lot

348
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:10,320
"but this is the obligation
of the relationship."

349
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,000
But, Mangs...

350
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,280
at least you still have him.

351
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,640
You'll just wake up one day,
and they'll be gone forever.

352
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,880
We're reaching in five minutes.

353
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,880
Story sent.

354
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,520
Don't bother Aunt Kavya and Dada, okay?

355
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,960
<i>I'll play with Arav all weekend.</i>

356
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,080
-Look, country cows!
-Sids, that's a buffalo.

357
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,360
Let's go back, please.

358
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,360
Mangs, you got this.

359
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,880
And we got you.

360
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,000
Let's go.

361
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,960
Ummi, my child.

362
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,160
Hello, Mom.

363
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,840
-Hello, Auntie.
-Who is it, Mom?

364
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,080
Ummi?

365
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,120
Hey, baby. Is your name Simrat?

366
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,240
-Are you Simrat?
-Who is that?

367
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,240
-Who is that?
-Do you know Diljit Dosanjh?

368
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,760
Of course. He's Aunt Pummy's son.

369
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,560
-Can you take me to meet him?
-Why not?

370
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,040
Let's meet Diljit tomorrow.

371
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:50,480
Hey, can you smell the samosas?

372
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,280
I got hot samosas from Nathu Lal's shop.

373
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,040
Hello, Papa.

374
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,840
How dare she step foot in my house?

375
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,200
Don't shout, Umang is outside.

376
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,840
What if she hears you?

377
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,680
Let her hear!

378
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,160
She humiliated us!

379
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:35,080
We were finally happy
with the birth of Simrat.

380
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,600
She couldn't tolerate it
and had to come here today.

381
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,640
-Please, relax.
-How can I?

382
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,440
We shouldn't have come.

383
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,680
Let's go.

384
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,120
At least drink your tea, Ummi.

385
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,440
Simrat is just like you.

386
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,800
Everyone says that.

387
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,160
Are you happy, Pinky?

388
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,160
Yes, I am.

389
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,760
-Please don't lie.
-I'm not lying.

390
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,400
My priorities have just changed.

391
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,120
Now, Simrat comes first,
and the rest after her.

392
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,920
Being a happy mom
doesn't mean you are happily married.

393
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,520
What's the point in thinking about it now?

394
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,560
Does Vikram care for Simrat?

395
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,840
Yes, always.

396
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,520
He's after her all day.

397
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,840
I also love Vikramjeet now.

398
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,240
Not like I love you, but as a best friend.

399
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,840
Is that enough for you?

400
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,320
Why do you ask now?

401
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,240
Why didn't you ask me
when I came to Mumbai?

402
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,400
Ummi!

403
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,120
I'm not complaining.

404
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,720
I'm fine.

405
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,160
You also be fine now.

406
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,280
And listen, whether she says it or not,

407
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,360
your mom still misses you a lot.

408
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,520
She needs you.

409
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,120
The way you need her.

410
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,360
And even when we grow up
and become independent,

411
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,800
everyone needs their family.

412
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,840
And weren't you going to
start a family of your own?

413
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,200
With Samara?

414
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,760
I already knew.

415
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,480
He's asking for sugar.

416
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,040
Ummi.

417
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,920
How's work?

418
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,160
Do you have any new celeb clients?

419
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:02,280
Don't even mention
those shameless, worthless people.

420
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,880
They're the ones creating this nonsense.

421
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,480
Isn't that right?

422
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,960
Didn't she trick you
into becoming like her?

423
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,920
Papa, I was always like this.

424
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,640
You never tried to get to know me.

425
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,160
You lived in my house for 22 years.

426
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,200
And she says that I don't even know her.

427
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,640
Excellent.

428
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,280
Who am I?

429
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,040
What are my interests?

430
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,680
My goals? Have you ever asked me about it?

431
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,960
You always told me,

432
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,000
"Girls belong to another family."

433
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,160
Maybe that's why
you never showed me any affection.

434
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,600
Shut up!

435
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,200
You always made me shut up.

436
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,960
Is that a father-daughter relationship?

437
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,200
She must've taught you that too.

438
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,200
Arguing with your father?

439
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,320
I'm your father, Umang.

440
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,040
It's your duty to respect me.

441
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:27,480
What about your duty? What about that?

442
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,120
I've been dealing with so much
over the last few months.

443
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,640
It was in the papers!
You couldn't even call me.

444
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,120
To ask if I'm okay. If I'm alive or dead.

445
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:45,400
God forbid I ever received a call
about something happening to you.

446
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,200
I wouldn't be able to forgive myself.

447
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:54,120
But if you got similar phone call
about me, would it matter to you at all?

448
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,760
I shouldn't have come here.

449
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,280
Nothing is going to change.

450
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,240
It's not that I do not love you.

451
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,840
I do.

452
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,480
But this is the obligation
of the relationship.

453
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,520
I'm tired of this twisted love.

454
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,000
Papa, I also love you very much.

455
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,560
And that's the obligation
of our relationship.

456
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,680
Can't we change that?

457
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,520
It's too late now.

458
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,960
It's too late.

459
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,640
Now...

460
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,960
I have just one daughter.

461
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,960
And her name is Pinky.

462
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,880
Stop it!

463
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,920
Umang is my daughter even today.

464
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,200
And she always will be.

465
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,680
I have three children.

466
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,320
Do you hear?

467
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,800
Wow, that's Dee, eating some butter!

468
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,520
Nice.

469
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,840
-It's for your headache.
-I'm fine.

470
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,240
Mangu!

471
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,440
{\an8}Hi!

472
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,440
Oh, shit! Incoming.

473
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,720
Please stop.

474
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,640
-Mangu?
-Hello, everyone.

475
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,640
-Hello.
-Hi, Neetu. Hi, Dolly.

476
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,200
You're in Ludhiana,

477
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,160
but no phone calls or status update.

478
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,920
God, you've changed so much.

479
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,480
And look, your entire arm
is covered with tattoos.

480
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,080
You are famous here.

481
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,120
And look at us.
We just got married and settled down.

482
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,200
And you are doing so well.

483
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,560
You built an amazing career.

484
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,760
And on your own terms.
Typical Umang style.

485
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:19,040
-Of course!
-We are so proud of you, Mangu!

486
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,320
Mama, I want to use the bathroom!

487
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,160
Why only when we are out?

488
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,320
Why didn't you use the bathroom
when I asked you to at home?

489
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,160
Come on, let's go.

490
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,680
-Okay, bye, Mangu.
-Bye!

491
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,600
-Let's go.
-Bye!

492
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,680
Wait, stop for a minute.

493
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,760
Mangu, listen to me. Come here.

494
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:45,640
This problem you have with Samara.
Don't worry, it'll get sorted.

495
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,360
After all, true love is true love.

496
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,640
Don't worry. See you later.

497
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:54,440
-Bye! Let's go.
-Bye.

498
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,040
Mangu?

499
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,760
Here, your true love awaits.

500
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,800
Also, we're very proud of you, too.

501
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,880
Hey, that's my school bus!

502
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,320
Girls, come on, let's go!

503
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,640
-Wait a minute.
-Guys, come!

504
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,880
-Wait a minute...
-You get the bus. Come.

505
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,200
It's a school bus, not a passenger bus.

506
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,320
Get off!

507
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,560
Mr. Teja Singh, it's me, Umang.

508
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,960
Umang!

509
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,600
Pain in the neck, school champion,

510
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:35,120
and my darling is all grown up now.

511
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,800
And you've become like Dharmendra,
more handsome than me.

512
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,000
-Where are you going?
-Same place you're going.

513
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,280
-School.
-School.

514
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,320
It was here where it all happened.

515
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,840
I finally discovered myself.

516
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,320
And right here,

517
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,960
I kissed Pinky for the first time.

518
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,680
I had strong feelings for her
from seventh standard.

519
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,640
And I just thought they were
extra strong feelings for a friend.

520
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,880
-Extra strong?
-I didn't know.

521
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:36,400
And you know how Vikramjeet
fell in love with Pinky?

522
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,760
Because of me.

523
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,680
Because Pinky would often come home

524
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,440
to see me.

525
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,640
And then,

526
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:54,160
Vikramjeet told Papa that
he wouldn't marry anyone but Pinky.

527
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,400
And Pinky chose

528
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,080
Vikramjeet

529
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,320
over me.

530
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,880
Forget it. It's fine. It's all good.

531
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:23,160
Okay, time for some old-fashioned
Punjabi therapy.

532
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,920
-Come on, let's go.
-Let's go!

533
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,640
Jump.

534
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,920
-Jump?
-What do you mean jump?

535
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,640
-Come on!
-No!

536
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,440
It'll be fun. Give it a try.

537
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,600
-Give it a try.
-Why should I go first?

538
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,200
You can do it. Come on.

539
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,800
Be the fearless journalist that you are.

540
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,840
-Yes! To the other side, let's go.
-Let's go.

541
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,800
-No!
-You can do it!

542
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,680
One, two, go...

543
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,880
Oh, my God!

544
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,400
All right!

545
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,360
Come on!

546
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,640
Where does this road go?

547
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:08,360
To Nathu Lal's for snacks
or Deluxe Cinema for a morning show.

548
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,600
Like <i>Silky Youth?</i>

549
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,120
<i>Flirt under the Skirt?</i>

550
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,480
You slut!

551
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,680
Hey, Punjabi ones are way better.
For example,

552
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,400
<i>-Jungle Boy, Tarzan.</i>
-Wow.

553
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,560
And my favorite,

554
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,160
<i>Where Do I Put My Manji?</i>

555
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,920
<i>Manji</i> meaning?

556
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,080
<i>Manji</i> means bed.

557
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,640
<i>Where Do I Put My Manji?</i>

558
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,600
Come on, let's go.

559
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,600
-"Where do you want to sleep tonight?"
-Let's go!

560
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,640
Oh, gosh.

561
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,280
That's it!

562
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,680
Nice one.

563
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,680
It's to chase the monkeys away, right?

564
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,600
Yes, today we'll use it
on some female monkeys.

565
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,440
One more.

566
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,160
Fuck expectations!

567
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,080
Fuck samosas!

568
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,040
Fuck helpless relationships!

569
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,200
All right, let's do this.

570
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,320
Fuck you, Shashank.

571
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,760
Fuck you, Varun! Fuck all you men!

572
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,840
Okay, not Arjun, actually.

573
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,800
-Here.
-Okay.

574
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,160
This is fun.

575
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,680
Come on.

576
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,880
Okay, fuck.

577
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,160
Fuck potholes!

578
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,160
Fuck mosquitoes!

579
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,840
Fuck all those coward editors
who won't hire me.

580
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,680
Fuck me because
I'm the biggest coward of them all.

581
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,000
I can't...

582
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,640
-You did good.
-It's okay.

583
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,760
-I can't. I... Sorry.
-It's okay.

584
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,360
-Come on, Sids.
-Fuck you, universe!

585
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,600
Fuck you for taking my dad
way before it was his time!

586
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,360
Sids, use the gun.

587
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,640
Come on, you can do it.
You got this. Come on.

588
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,440
-Pick it up, come on.
-Come on, Sids.

589
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,960
Just aim and shoot.

590
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,000
-Oh, fuck!
-Sids!

591
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,440
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

592
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,160
-What are you doing?
-Are you hurt?

593
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,000
-Bro, say something.
-Sid!

594
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,160
Are you hurt? Are you all right?

595
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,640
-What's going on?
-Oh, fuck.

596
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,320
-What!
-No, she's fine.

597
