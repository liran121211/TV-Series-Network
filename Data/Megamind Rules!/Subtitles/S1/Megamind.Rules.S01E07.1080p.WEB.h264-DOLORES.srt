Megamind: Welcome to "Megamind's
Rules For Defending Your City!"

12
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,926
Today, we're
sprucing up the lair

13
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,721
and cleaning out our
emails from the onternet.

14
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:57,766
My number-one fan
Terry Sasko writes,

15
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,477
"How important to crime
fighting is handsomeness?"

16
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,937
Why, it's like the
number one thing!

17
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,230
Myself aside,

18
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:07,150
keeping your heroic lair
handsome is critical,

19
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,651
and the secrets are simple.

20
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:11,363
Elbow grease, a huge
army of brainbots,

21
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,907
and a compassionate supervisor.

22
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,408
Double time, brainbots!

23
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,786
I wanna be able to make a
sandwich on a toilet seat!

24
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,162
- Sir!

25
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:21,557
I was cleaning the Gallery of
the Vanquished when I noticed

26
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,250
that Machiavillain's golden
hairbrush was missing!

27
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:28,338
- Machiavillain's golden hairbrush...

28
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,131
Keiko: Uh, Earth to Megs.

29
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:33,259
What the heck is a
Mack-a-blah-blah's golden hairbrush?

30
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:35,762
Dear Keiko, that
hairbrush belonged

31
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:38,765
to my villain shool
master, Machiavillain.

32
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,726
He was the greatest
bad guy who ever lived.

33
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,438
Cunning and cruel, with
long, luxurious hair

34
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:48,316
and the voice of
a glam rock angel.

35
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:51,444
He ruled the world of
villainy with wicked schemes,

36
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,988
power chords, and, most of all

37
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,782
presentation!

38
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:58,952
He still sends
shivers down my spine.

39
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,912
And then
I defeated him,

40
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:03,164
which completed my
training and bada-bing,

41
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,791
I'm the world's
greatest villain!

42
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:07,252
And now, I'm a hero but I'd
still really like to know

43
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,170
where that brush went.

44
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,588
Now, where was I?

45
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:13,133
- Happy birthday, girl!

46
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,427
Oh, you got me a drone?!

47
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,429
Yeah. You can use your
phone to control it

48
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,514
and talk through it.
Hide behind your couch,

49
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,350
and you can use it to scare
the new city comptroller.

50
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:25,186
- Not that I tried that.
- So cool, Roxie!

51
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,272
Thank you so much.

52
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,112
And me?

53
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:37,615
I have... a very big surprise.

54
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:40,869
It's a, a very surprising thing,

55
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,245
even to me.

56
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,788
It's okay you forgot

57
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,891
because I know exactly what
I want for my birthday.

58
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:49,044
You told me you'd train
me to be a crime fighter.

59
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,088
- That's what I want.
- I never told you that. Ow!

60
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:55,258
You help me,

61
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:57,385
I'll train you to
be a crime fighter.

62
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,429
You have my word.

63
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:03,808
Well... it appears I did.

64
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:06,728
Sadly, I don't
think you're ready.

65
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,272
You might have to put in
a little more work first.

66
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:10,982
Or a lot more. Actually,

67
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,360
I need you to sweep the
curbs around the lair,

68
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:15,528
lest Roxanne send her
filth police after me.

69
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:18,239
I don't have filth police. But

70
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,283
- Memo. Patrol
cars with mop wheels.

71
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:21,868
Little brooms in holsters.

72
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:24,454
I don't wanna sweep
curbs on my birthday!

73
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,164
Uh, maybe I'm one of those

74
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,791
make-you-do-chores-until-surprise!

75
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,476
You-know-how-
to-do-everything teachers.

76
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,294
Oh, but really, I'm
not a teacher at all.

77
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,880
Self-teaching is the best.
That's what I've always said.

78
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:37,926
But you had a teacher!
The hairbrush guy!

79
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,929
Trust me, you're better
off teaching yourself. Bye!

80
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,183
That was shockingly harsh.

81
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,018
Would you like me
to invite her back

82
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:48,853
and destroy her surprise?

83
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:51,648
Which is? I'm so excited to hear

84
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,566
what you make up
right this second.

85
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:57,112
I'm gonna, uh, make a cake.

86
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,280
A cake for Keiko! Nailed it.

87
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,408
Come on.

88
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,326
You don't know how to
make a glass of water.

89
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:04,911
How hard can it be?

90
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:08,039
Have you ever heard the
term "piece of cake"?

91
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:09,916
Chum! To the hot refrigerator!

92
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,967
-New drone
camera check. Looks good.

93
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,470
Welcome to "Keiko's Rules
For Defending Your City!"

94
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,597
So, Megamind thinks I'm
not ready for training.

95
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:26,766
Well, I'm not ready
to not be ready.

96
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,810
And since he wanted
me to teach myself,

97
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:32,188
I borrowed this. Boom!
Disguise generator.

98
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:33,940
To prove I'm hero material,

99
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,625
I'm gonna infiltrate
the Doom Syndicate

100
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,694
and find out their
next big moves.

101
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:41,448
Luckily, Megamind just put
shadow boy in the slammer, so

102
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,491
- : What up!

103
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,536
I'm Nighty-Knight. I'm
dumb and think I'm scary,

104
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:49,664
and Keiko Morita is awesome.

105
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,044
To find their hideout,

106
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,296
I encircled their
metadata to pinpoint

107
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,174
- the exact location of... Wait.

108
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,468
That's their secret hideout?

109
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:03,511
- Man, these guys are do of uses.

110
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:10,185
- Look at me! I am kicking your derriere! Ho, ho, ho!

111
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,270
Come on, guys!

112
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,439
This is a communal workspace!

113
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:15,982
We're supposed to
be a community!

114
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:20,111
Quiet! Behemoth having
hard time with 'puter.

115
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,282
- I'm gonna call the cops on you!

116
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,867
Then, I'll be the one laughing!

117
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,078
Ha, ha, ha... Ah!

118
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:30,413
Behemoth say quiet down!

119
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:33,500
You no listen, so you go up!

120
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:36,628
You guys are a bunch of bullies!

121
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,713
His feet are dangling!

122
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,445
Keiko-As-Nighty-Knight: Dark
tidings! And other dark... things.

123
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:47,138
Yes, I have freed
myself from prison.

124
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:49,516
Now, what's our next dark plan?

125
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:52,102
Nighty-Knight, where
are the sandwiches?

126
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,479
Uh... the what?

127
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,940
Has prison made you dumb-dumb?

128
00:05:57,065 --> 00:06:00,902
When one of us escape, they
bring sandwiches for all.

129
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:04,030
Oh! Yeah. I was
gonna pick some up,

130
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:07,200
but, you know,
darkness and... stuff.

131
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,910
So,

132
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:12,122
what are we gonna do next
to bring old Megamind down?

133
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:13,748
Let me get this straight.

134
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,876
You go to jail for a day,
forget the sandwiches,

135
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:20,714
and think we're gonna start
letting you in on planning? No!

136
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,549
We plan, you do chores.

137
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:25,385
Drop my lucky beret
at ze cleaners.

138
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,680
- Actually, we all have filthy outfits to go there.

139
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,020
That's right.

140
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:37,605
Of all the villains I
could've impersonated,

141
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,066
I picked the one
that gets chores.

142
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:45,405
- Ah! The cake is ready.

143
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,198
Sir, perhaps you should've used,

144
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,409
you know, a recipe.

145
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,134
If a birthday is going
to be a surprise,

146
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,164
shouldn't the
ingredients be as well?

147
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:57,709
Now, let's marvel at its
sponge-like fluffiness.

148
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:04,841
Well, that certainly
was a surprise.

149
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,679
Now, with a slight adjustment...

150
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,556
And a pinch of love!

151
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:15,810
This first layer will be about
as moist as a cake can be.

152
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:17,770
- Ah!

153
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,148
Achilles' high-tops!

154
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,941
Are you okay?

155
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,319
Eh, it's all going
according to plan.

156
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,988
Ah, so 12-degree burns
were part of your plan.

157
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,702
Oh, well done, Sir!

158
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,704
You see, Chum? With
trial and error,

159
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,414
one can accomplish anything.

160
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,850
- Chum: Wah!

161
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,168
- Help! Get it off! Get it off!

162
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,130
- Just to be clear,

163
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,800
this is for Keiko's
birthday this year, right?

164
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,765
- Behemoth appreciate help.

165
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,559
Didn't know you
knew about 'puters.

166
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:59,854
Keiko-As-Nighty-Knight: Are you sure you
have to print this entire collection?

167
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,649
Behemoth: It Behemoth's
favorite comic strip.

168
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:06,319
Funny cat keeps Behemoth
temper in check.

169
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,464
- You know, all
of your failed print jobs

170
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,240
- are jamming up the queue.

171
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:11,741
You be patient

172
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:15,912
or Behemoth crush
and melt your bones!

173
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:21,334
See? Behemoth need all 10,000
pages of Happy Pizza Cat.

174
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,755
- Control alt delete,

175
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,258
and print-a-doodle-doo.

176
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:31,261
Behemoth thank you.

177
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:34,139
- Oh! Ah!

178
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,641
Hey, I just want to apologize

179
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,810
for the behavior
of my coworkers.

180
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,770
Thanks. That means a lot.

181
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,856
I'm grateful one of you
is capable of kindness.

182
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:48,737
- Huh?

183
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,447
Who are you?

184
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:51,865
I work for Megamind!

185
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,533
Can you get my
back if I need it?

186
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:54,978
Well, I would,
but I'm too afraid

187
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,828
of what these bullies
are capable of.

188
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,205
Come on. You're
the former mayor!

189
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,708
- You got a little cutthroat in you.
- Huh.

190
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,793
Well, I suppose I did
crush Bulldog McGoo

191
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,170
in that runoff election.

192
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:08,548
Look, if Megamind can help
put these guys back in prison,

193
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,091
then I'll do what I can to help.

194
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,468
And call me Jody.

195
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:15,055
Jody Smelt. I do it all.
Taxes, food delivery...

196
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,474
Oh! And blown-glass
figurines, huh?

197
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:20,852
- These are cool.
- Lady Doppler: Nighty-Knight! We need you!

198
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,855
- Gotta go.

199
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,027
We saw you typing out
there, and we thought,

200
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:32,697
"Yes! One of us finally
learned how to type!"

201
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,450
- Me make big ideas

202
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,828
to help big boss take
down Megamind. You type.

203
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:42,582
Keiko-As-Nighty-Knight: Big boss?
Who's bigger than us? Am I right?

204
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,626
- Oh, mais oui, mais oui!

205
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:48,004
He's much funnier now
that he knows how to type.

206
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,172
- D'accord!

207
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,549
To take down Megamind,
we should first...

208
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:56,763
Nighty-Knight: What in
the blazes is going on?!

209
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:59,974
Keiko-As-Nighty-Knight: Uh,
I'll tell you what's going on!

210
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,644
- I'm the real Nighty-Knight!
- Nighty-Knight: No,

211
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,105
I'm the real Nighty-Knight.

212
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,982
Well, this one
brought sandwiches.

213
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,402
Yeah, but this one
knows how to type.

214
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,154
Keiko-As-Nighty-Knight: As the
real, actual Nighty-Knight,

215
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,490
I can totally throw
my shadow, right?

216
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:19,119
N-No way this loser
impostor can shadow-throw.

217
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:21,121
Nighty-Knight: Let's
see if this imposter

218
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,748
can conjure up an
entire unicorn.

219
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,918
- Made of darkness!

220
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,963
- What?
- Weak shadow, bro.

221
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:33,133
Keiko-As-Nighty-Knight: So weak. Do
I even need to throw mine?

222
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:35,010
I mean, you can pick
him if you want,

223
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,887
but you'll lose these
magic typing fingers.

224
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:41,016
I declare the Nighty-Knight
who can type is the real one.

225
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,077
- Nighty-Knight: No! Let me go again.

226
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:45,103
Machiavillain: What is going on?

227
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,981
I can hardly hear
myself scheming.

228
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:49,733
Keiko-As-Nighty-Knight: Whoa...

229
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,836
Machiavillain: Either
Nighty-Knight has a twin sibling,

230
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,820
and Heaven help
us if that's true,

231
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:57,073
or we have an
impostor in our midst.

232
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,701
We cannot figure out
who is the real one!

233
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,078
Hm. Wild guess,

234
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:06,041
maybe not the one wearing
Megamind's disguise generator.

235
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,209
- Sacre bleu!
- Why didn't we see that?

236
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,003
Honestly,
if I had a head,

237
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,255
I'd shake it in disappointment.

238
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,175
Now, let's see who
our surprise guest is.

239
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,763
Busted. Huh?!

240
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:22,307
Hi, Busted. Me Behemoth.

241
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,560
- Megamind: Okay, look.

242
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:29,147
Roxanne: Megamind. That's

243
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:30,272
beautiful.

244
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:32,817
Oh... Mind if I
take a little taste?

245
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,236
Don't move a muscle!

246
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:39,032
Sorry. Just look at it
for a few more seconds.

247
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:41,409
Close your eyes even
tighter than before.

248
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,786
Believe in me,

249
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:46,039
knowing in your heart
that I have the ability

250
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:49,459
to create a perfect
cake for Keiko.

251
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:52,212
- Something's fishy.
- Sorry. That's me.

252
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,464
I'm a bit overdue
for a bowl cleaning.

253
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,508
- No, not you, Chum.

254
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,678
Oh, gimme a break!

255
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:01,596
A cardboard cutout of a cake

256
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:05,100
might not be the mind-blowing
surprise you'd hoped for.

257
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,477
I don't know. It's a
pretty nice picture.

258
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:09,771
I'd love that for
my birthday, Sir.

259
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,064
Fine.

260
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:14,317
Making a cake is
actually hard for me.

261
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:15,944
There, I said it.

262
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,238
It's okay.

263
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:22,158
You know, I can teach
you how to make a cake.

264
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,411
You? You can't bake!

265
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:27,455
Those muffins you made tasted
like charred hair follicles.

266
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,958
I'll have you know I've
been taking online classes,

267
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,502
and my food is much more edible.

268
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,254
So, do you want my help?

269
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,339
I don't need help
from you or anyone!

270
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,342
Believe me, self-teaching
is the best.

271
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,803
If you teach me, the
only way I can be sure

272
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,889
I've mastered cake-making is
if I defeat you in battle,

273
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:46,850
and I really don't
want to do that to you.

274
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,351
I-I think your last teacher

275
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,770
may have given you the
wrong idea about teaching.

276
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,356
- Oh, so many wrong ideas.

277
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,984
Machiavillain was
villainy incarnate.

278
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,944
Pure evil.

279
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:00,196
Evil...
Evil... Evil...

280
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:03,116
Machiavillain: Can I get
you some gum? Boba tea?

281
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:06,327
Oh, silly me.
You must be so lost.

282
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:10,415
I'm Machiavillain, an
old friend of Megamind's.

283
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,210
It is a pleasure to finally
make your acquaintance, Keiko.

284
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:17,172
It's very clear to me that
you're a gifted student

285
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,257
in desperate need of
the right teacher.

286
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,092
Actually, Megamind promised...

287
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,886
Machiavillain:
Megamind.

288
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,322
He could've been
the greatest villain

289
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:25,972
the world has ever seen.

290
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:28,975
He had so much potential.

291
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,061
It must be heartbreaking

292
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:32,896
he doesn't see yours.

293
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:35,440
That's... actually why I'm here.

294
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,275
Figured I'd give evil a shot.

295
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,320
And you'd be a much better
teacher than Megamind.

296
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:42,072
How do we know she's not
just trying to spy on us

297
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:44,699
- for her old boss?
- Machiavillain: Hm...

298
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,327
She's right. You'll have
to prove your loyalty

299
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,537
before we can start
your training.

300
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,164
Yeah, sure. Okay.

301
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:54,084
What do you want me to do?
Rob a bank? Destroy the moon?

302
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:56,252
- I want you to steal.

303
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:59,714
Megamind's baby binky.

304
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,758
That's it. Seriously?

305
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:03,361
Machiavillain: Think
of it as a small test

306
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:06,763
before we let you in
on our bigger plans.

307
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:08,264
But know this.

308
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,766
You try anything funny,

309
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:12,352
and you will force
me to do something

310
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,979
- most regrettable.

311
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:16,856
Maybe I will take that boba.

312
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:22,570
Soft enough that you
can't use it for hockey,

313
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,906
and it's not walking
off on its own power.

314
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,950
Clearly, I have nailed this!

315
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,498
Maybe
it needs more salt.

316
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:36,334
How can it be that bad?

317
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:40,922
Maybe when
we can move again,

318
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:44,134
you finally let me teach
you how to make a cake.

319
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:46,720
That might be a good idea.

320
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:03,278
Okay, drone. Let's do this.

321
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:07,615
Keiko Recording : Yoo-hoo!
Drones rule! Brainbots drool!

322
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:26,593
- Whoa!

323
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:29,721
This is more than just a binky.

324
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,640
This has some kind of... power.

325
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:35,101
I can't just hand
this to Machiavillain,

326
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:37,187
but I have to find
out what his plan is!

327
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:38,772
Oh, think, Keiko. Think!

328
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:44,569
If you want an exact copy,

329
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:47,030
it's gonna take
me about an hour.

330
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:48,406
I don't have an hour!

331
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,200
I'm giving the Doomers the fake,

332
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:53,495
then I gotta get the OG back
to Megamind lickety-split.

333
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,660
So, this is to pull one
over on those creeps, right?

334
00:15:56,748 --> 00:16:00,043
I'll do it in the 15 fastest
minutes of your life.

335
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:05,382
What's the real reason
you won't train Keiko?

336
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:07,967
That's personal.
I'll never tell.

337
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:10,553
Oh, you better tell, or
I'm gonna tickle you.

338
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:13,056
Good luck. We can't move.

339
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:15,141
Well, look at this.

340
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:18,269
Stop!
Ah! Please stop!

341
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:20,689
Not until you fess up.

342
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:24,067
Now, what's more tickly
than your armpit?

343
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:25,512
- Please! Not my ears!

344
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:29,948
So, why won't you train her?

345
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:33,827
Because I don't want
to put Keiko through

346
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:36,538
what I went through!
Especially the whole...

347
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:41,543
defeat-me-to-prove-her-mastery
thing!

348
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,503
Oh! Oh, thank goodness.

349
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:45,755
Just because that's
the way you were taught

350
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,841
doesn't mean you'll
do the same to Keiko.

351
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:50,510
Look, if I teach
you to make a cake,

352
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:53,596
I promise you won't
have to defeat me.

353
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:56,558
Okay, okay. You have a deal.

354
00:16:56,683 --> 00:17:00,353
Great. I'll gather ingredients.
Uh, you regain mobility.

355
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:03,314
Wait. How did it wear
off on you so quickly?

356
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,483
I was faking. You really think

357
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,569
I'd swallow
something you cooked?

358
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:08,695
Come on...

359
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,365
Fake's in your hand.

360
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,135
I've marked it with a
little lightning bolt.

361
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:15,869
- See?
- Keiko: Cool.

362
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:18,455
The original is in your
backpack. Good luck.

363
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:21,207
- Mm, yes.

364
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:23,335
I can sense the power.

365
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,545
The binky has entered the room.

366
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,714
- Mission accomplished.

367
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,674
Huh?

368
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:35,305
Well, you've done well, Keiko.

369
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:39,225
Come. You've earned the coveted
Seat of Dishonor at our table.

370
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,063
- Nighty-Knight: Aw...

371
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:44,773
Aw, yeah.

372
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:48,610
Now you're ready to hear the
details of my genius plan.

373
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:52,280
In fact, you're an
integral part of it.

374
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,910
Keiko Morita,

375
00:17:57,035 --> 00:18:00,663
the "expert in all
things Megamind,"

376
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:03,166
didn't know that this binky

377
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:07,420
is one of the most powerful
energy sources in the universe!

378
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:10,632
- Huh?
- And it is the final component needed

379
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:15,553
to restore my body to its
stunning and glamorous glory.

380
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,014
Power up the
regeneration machine!

381
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:21,619
Lady Doppler: Thanks to
Megamind's nincompoopery

382
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:23,103
when he was playing mayor,

383
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:25,730
we acquired the perfect
vessel for the machine.

384
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:27,731
Ta-da!

385
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:31,778
Nighty-Knight: While Megamind was
obsessing over his social media,

386
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:34,322
I managed to steal this
genetically modified starfish

387
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:38,076
with enhanced regeneration
powers from the aquarium.

388
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:39,953
Pierre: Merci to Megamind,

389
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:41,746
we not only managed
to get ze isotopes

390
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:43,832
we needed to fuel ze machine...

391
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:46,918
Behemoth: Evil friend steal
brush with hair sample.

392
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:51,673
We use DNA from hair sample
to rebuild big boss' body.

393
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:54,259
And now, we have the
power of the binky

394
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:56,344
to bring my plan to fruition.

395
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:02,350
Hate to interrupt your long
cliché villain explanation,

396
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,644
but I just gave you
a fake binky, dude.

397
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:07,772
And I got the real one
right here. See ya!

398
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,733
- Get her!

399
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,404
She's around here somewhere!

400
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:22,328
Keiko: Megamind!
It's Keiko! Bad news.

401
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:25,481
- I'm in a jam and need your help.

402
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:28,293
I'm behind a fire truck
parked on the corner of...

403
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:30,503
- Seize her! Huh?

404
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:32,940
Keiko : Maybe you guys
should be called the Dumb Syndicate!

405
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:35,133
Ha, ha! Smile for
the blooper reel!

406
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:37,719
Lady Doppler: How did
she get so slippery?!

407
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:40,555
Tricky girl turned
into flying machine!

408
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:49,230
Ah!  Oh no!

409
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:54,027
- Whoa!

410
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:55,152
Ah!

411
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,658
- Whoa!

412
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:03,411
- Ah, ha!

413
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:04,954
- Ah!
- Ho, ho!

414
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,208
- You will
double-cross your friends.

415
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:12,796
You will double-cross
your friends.

416
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,590
Uh, if I insist.

417
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,475
- Have at you!
- Nighty-Knight: Ah!

418
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:20,887
Not cool, bro! Ow!
Personal space, man!

419
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:26,559
Keiko, you're
just too smart for 'em.

420
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:29,938
Nighty-Knight: We
failed you most darkly.

421
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:31,606
The child escaped.

422
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,650
And why would that matter?

423
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:38,905
It's the fake!

424
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:42,283
You see, a long cliché
villain explanation

425
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:44,244
is always a good distraction

426
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:48,123
when swapping out fake
binkies for real ones.

427
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:55,463
When Megamind finds out
what his little pupil did,

428
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:58,550
it'll rip their team to
shreds!

429
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:05,890
Megamind, I-I have to
tell you something.

430
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:07,809
Megamind: No, no,
no! Not a word,

431
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:11,563
as I am about to present
your birthday surprise.

432
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:14,607
- But this is really...
- Shushie shush shushles.

433
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:17,027
I present to you

434
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:18,987
your very own cake!

435
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:22,240
You really shouldn't
have. Believe me.

436
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:24,367
But, I made it myself!

437
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:26,828
You deserve every crumb.

438
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:30,081
- Will you do us the honors?
- I-I really shouldn't.

439
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:33,209
- Ugh, just cut the cake.
- Oh, come on, Keiko! It's your birthday!

440
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:36,004
If you insist.

441
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:39,632
- Um...

442
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:41,259
Something's in there.

443
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:45,013
Well, reach in and find
out what!

444
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:54,147
A hero costume?

445
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:57,484
I apologize for earlier.

446
00:21:57,609 --> 00:22:00,779
You're ready to
begin your training.

447
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:03,573
No. I'm not ready
for this at all.

448
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:05,533
Keiko, are you alright?

449
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:08,244
Uh, totally. I...

450
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:13,458
My mom has a thing for me
at home, so I gotta go.

451
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:16,670
Just gonna leave
this here for now.

452
00:22:16,795 --> 00:22:20,715
Thanks, but... I don't
deserve you guys.

453
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:42,028
Machiavillain: Now we
can really get to work.
