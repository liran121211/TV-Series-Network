Hey, just because I'm
a hero doesn't mean

53
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,881
I've lost my appreciation
for quality treachery.

54
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:15,802
She shot lightning at me!
And, yes, I did get her fired.

55
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,846
But now, I have to
arrange a bodyguard,

56
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,223
cancel public appearances,
probably build a bunker.

57
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:23,810
There, there. Relax your boo-tay
on that ergonomic chair, Roxie.

58
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:26,646
Stopping baddies is
my bag. Fear not!

59
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:29,024
It's easy for you
to say, "Fear not."

60
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,484
You're walking around all
safe with a pew-pew ray gun.

61
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:33,862
It's more of a
chick a-pow ray gun.

62
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,614
But, my wits protect this
city more than my weapon.

63
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,617
Which brings me to the

Great. He's already upset about
you blowing up his garage.

in helping stop
the Doom Syndicate,

174
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:11,139
I present Keiko Morita
with this award.

175

No. I'm Megamind.

Keiko: I appreciate
you taking time

180
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:23,860
from throwing darts
at the mayor's picture

181
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,070

(sighs) Okay, okay.

185
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:33,536
(sighs) He tried some
switcheroo tech on me,

186
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:34,913
and it's not wearing off.

187
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,956
And how is that a bad thing?

188

Megamind for a day.

back to my office.

He's at my desk,
looking like me,

193
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,514
and I have to make sure he
doesn't do any mayor stuff!

194
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,182
You could do that,

195
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,726
or you could not be
a totally lame person

196
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,520
and stop some crimes!

197
00:07:58,645 --> 00:07:59,854
- Yeah, but...
- Hear me out.

198
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,565
This could also help

199
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:05,485
I need some content where
he's a little more personable,

515
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:58,216
Chum! Snow globe!

516
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,802
(grunts, yells)

517
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:03,013
(Lady Doppler grunts)

518
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:04,139
Yes!

519
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:06,516
(screaming)

520
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:09,060
I think I'm gonna
be sick! (Retches)

521
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:12,355
Doppler out. (Whimpers)

522
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,190
That's a wrap, everybody!

523
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:16,651
(upbeat music playing)

524
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,237
Outstanding work.

525
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:21,740
Specifically the saving me part.

526
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:23,575
(laughs) I even had a cool line!

527
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,786
Looks like the sky
is clearing up!

528
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:30,665
Crowd: Megamind!
Megamind! Megamind!

529
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,001
(sighs) It sounds so beautiful.

530
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:34,627
Like angels.

531
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:36,671
You calmed them down
all on your own.

532
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,048
That's great.

533
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:40,633
They were chanting your
name earlier, I swear.

534
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:43,553
Looks like Metrocity
loves us both once again.

535
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:45,972
Bring it in, team.

536
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:49,059
I love this new
in-touch-with-your-feelings Sir.

537
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:52,645
Let's not get too used to it.
Maybe just special occasions.

541
00:22:08,703 --> 00:22:09,871
Roxie: Thank you!

542
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:14,334
Now, I hate to be
a "mayor downer..."

543
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:17,170
Get it? Like major...
(sighs) Never mind.

544
00:22:17,295 --> 00:22:20,882
Parking rules are back in effect
and fines will be doubled.

545
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:22,568
- I gotta move my car!
- I can't afford a ticket!

546
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:24,969
- (car doors slam)
- (tires squeal)

547
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:26,971
Thanks for the opportunity, Sir.

548
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:29,849
- From now on, this song will be ours.
