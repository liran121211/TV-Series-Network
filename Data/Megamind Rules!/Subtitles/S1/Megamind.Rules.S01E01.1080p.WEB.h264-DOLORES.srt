Megamind: You've met
your match, evildoer.

12
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,718
For I, Megamind,

13
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,887
am the hero of Metrocity!

14
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:56,222
And you will feel my

15
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:59,142
steely justice
with the force of a

16
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:01,811
an angry llama!

17
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:04,481
Ol' Chum: Oh, nonsense. I
think you're improving, sir!

18
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:07,359
That's way better than attacking
their mothers personally!

19
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:08,943
I'm clueless, Chum!

20
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,322
Now that I'm a hero, I
want to inspire the people

21
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,449
the way Metro Man did!

22
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,243
Being a villain and
stoking fear is a breeze,

23
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:20,997
but how do I conjure
awe and eyes-agogginess?

24
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:22,582
Do I need to exercise?

25
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:24,584
- What about flossing?

26
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,795
Sir, robbery in progress
at Everything City!

27
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,799
Ha-ha! Move over, bad
breath and sensitive gums!

28
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,801
There's crime to be stopped!

29
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:37,514
Let's go! Hurry it up!

30
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,349
This isn't Some Of It City.

31
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,685
- Fork over everything!

32
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,605
Villain, beware! For I
am the white knight of...

33
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,315
Dude Monkey: Bananalamadingdong!

34
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,275
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

35
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:51,861
Woo! Yeah!

36
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:54,114
Hey, Dude Monkerinos!

37
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,408
Your happy hometown
Dude Monkey here.

38
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:59,035
Shall we schtop another crime?

39
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,870
What is that thing?

40
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,289
- Hyah!
- What?!

41
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:08,336
Let's can this tuna fish!

42
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,797
- Oh, my!

43
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:14,467
Did I do it again?
I schtopped a crime!

44
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:17,887
- Say, Bananalamadingdong!

45
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:19,472
Post that on your sosh

46
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,891
and you'll get
beaucoup engagements!

47
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:23,810
- Thanks!
- What? Megamind?

48
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:26,021
Oh, must have beat
him to the scene.

49
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,605
Sorry, Mr. Atric.

50
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:31,234
Hey, can I call
you Geri?

51
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:34,112
JK, bro! I'm Dude Monkey!

52
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:38,158
Say 'sup to my Dude Monkerinos!

53
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,536
- 'Sup?
- Remember to like and subscribe

54
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,538
if you think the city
needs a fresher fighter

55
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,833
than this horse-and-buggy
bagpipe head!

56
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,835
Bananalamadingdong!

57
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:52,547
What in Hades'
hamper just happened?

58
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,841
What just happened was awesome!

59
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,885
You've been a hero
just a short time,

60
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,929
and already, you're influencing
strangely charismatic youngsters

61
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:01,264
to defend the city!

62
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:04,392
Perhaps I'm more
inspiring than I thought.

63
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,645
As mayor, I don't
have actual control

64
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,189
over the sun.

65
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,566
Yes, well, I have a
lot on my plate today,

66
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,277
but I promise to absolutely
look into it, Senator.

67
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,237
- Huh?

68
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,824
- Ollo... Ow!

69
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,242
Whoa!

70
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:22,869
My brilliant blue noggin!

71
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,330
You know, you're not
a villain anymore.

72
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,040
You can use the front door.

73
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,250
But a monitor? Really, Roxanne?

74
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:32,754
Sorry. Muscle
memory. I'm a little on edge.

75
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,548
Just found out the Doom
Syndicate escaped from prison.

76
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,425
They escaped already?

77
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,428
I must say, the former
villain part of me is proud.

78
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,722
But the hero part of me
is incredibly frustrated

79
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,033
- with our prison system!

80
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,643
You'd think they'd lay low,
but I guess Nighty-Knight

81
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:50,063
couldn't resist Taquito Tuesday
at Dos Muchachos Picante.

82
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,899
Can't blame him. Their
tacos are delightful,

83
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,735
but if he pops his
Halloween head up again,

84
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,530
I have just the
treat for his tricks!

85
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,323
Hey, can I ask another favor?

86
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,827
Ma'am, do not offer
Megamind the aquarium gig!

87
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,204
Well, well, if it isn't
Christina Christo,

88
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,540
the Secretary of Party Pooping.

89
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,709
It's Chief of Staff, actually.

90
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:13,753
My job is to make sure
Roxanne can get reelected.

91
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,964
Something you don't
seem to care about.

92
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,051
What's this gig she
doesn't want me to have?

93
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:23,179
So they're having a grand
re-opening of the aquarium

94
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:25,682
and want me to
make an appearance?

95
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,600
To warn baddies
against another attempt

96
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,936
at the diamond-encrusted
koi fish, no doubt.

97
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,439
It says "hero," not
live-action blueberry.

98
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:33,564
- Ha!
- Gimme that!

99
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,191
I'm looking for ways

100
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,735
to be more inspirational,

101
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,280
and nothing inspires citizenry
like a bombastic speech

102
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,632
- at a relaxing, fish-filled...

103
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,200
- Ah!
- Got it! Ma'am,

104
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:47,203
he's the one who destroyed the
aquarium in the first place.

105
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:50,206
If you want to save a fish, you
gotta break a few aquariums.

106
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,708
- That's mine!

107
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,460
- Give it to me!
- Megamind: Gimme!

108
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:55,628
Great. You both owe
a tree an apology.

109
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:58,381
Christina, we've
got to use Megamind.

110
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:01,051
He's Metro City's
best and only hero.

111
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,553
Not anymore. There is
a new hero in town,

112
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,805
and his name is Dude Monkey.

113
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,267
The petty crime stopper who
was totally inspired by moi?

114
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,311
Why hire a second-rate wannabe

115
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,521
when you can have a
first-rate is-a-be?

116
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,732
Roxanne: He makes a
good point. Christina,

117
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:19,194
send word to the aquarium board
that I'm recommending Megamind.

118
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,571
Fine.

119
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,448
Nee-nuh nee-nuh nee-nuh!

120
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:24,908
- Roxanne: Kids,

121
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,077
no ice cream unless
you stop fighting.

122
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,555
Both: I will when you
admit I'm the favorite.

123
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,331
Jinx. Double jinx. Triple jinx!

124
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:34,209
Enough! Go play outside.
Mama's gotta work.

125
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,879
- What about that icèd cream you promised?

126
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:41,164
- Megamind: Wanna look my best for the aquarium gig.

127
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,509
Time to get my blue bod ripped

128
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:45,136
with some hardcore
physical fitness.

129
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,308
Chum! A little help!

130
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,895
Faster, Chum. I
wanna feel that burn.

131
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,980
You got a big problem, Double M.

132
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:59,192
I know. Chum is
horrifically out of shape.

133
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,403
Your problem is Dude Monkey.

134
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:04,072
Shall we schtop another crime?

135
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:07,575
- Ooh! A video! Can I watch?

136
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:10,787
That chimp chump is no
threat. He looks up to me.

137
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:14,791
He's proof that my aim to
inspire Metrocity is working.

138
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,794
Good luck inspiring people
when this guy's trolling you.

139
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,754
What's with
this troll business?

140
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,840
They've been
extinct for decades.

141
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:24,718
Trolling means he's trying
to humiliate you online.

142
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,886
- Sorry, Mr. Atric.

143
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:30,265
Hey, can I call
you Geri?

144
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,308
JK, bro!

145
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:33,893
Geriatric means old.

146
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:35,454
We don't want this
guy to take your place

147
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,565
as defender of Metro City by
defining you as out of touch.

148
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,484
This video has a
quarter million views!

149
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:44,738
It must have aired on
the 6 o'clock news.

150
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,574
Oh, you're serious?

151
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,409
Uh, I-I'm actually
gonna ask this.

152
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,828
Have you ever heard
of the internet?

153
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,080
Yes, I've heard
of the "onternet."

154
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,041
I'm just not onterested.

155
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:59,502
It's a passing fad, like fidget
spinners or paying your taxes.

156
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,880
Okay, well, in that case,

157
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,798
welcome to the Information Age.

158
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,760
- You're about 30 years late.

159
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,386
This is a television.

160
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,347
- True!
- Wasn't a question.

161
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:12,349
But was I right?
Can I get a point?

162
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:15,060
- Sure.
- One to zip.

163
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:17,562
Back in the age when people
used to live in caves,

164
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:18,998
this is how they'd
get their news.

165
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:22,275
True! Ha-ha, all tied up.

166
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,612
But the internet connects to
every computer on the planet.

167
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,906
- You guys know that, right?
- No, we do not.

168
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,866
But I do know I'm right
about us not knowing,

169
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,785
so another point for Chum.

170
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,304
Keiko: Not something
to be proud of.

171
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:35,622
So, with the Internet
and social media,

172
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,874
you can put out a story
and send it anywhere

173
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,876
and to everyone instantly!

174
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,629
They call this going viral.

175
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,673
I went viral on Metrocity once.

176
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,841
Gave everyone dance fever.

177
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,636
I should get 10 retroactive
points for that, honestly.

178
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:51,971
- Fine.
- What, does that mean I win?

179
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:53,640
Sure. You're the grand champion

180
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,558
of learning about the
internet way too late!

181
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:57,394
- Yes!
- No!

182
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,354
Now, listen. Dude
Monkey is engaging

183
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,816
in a social media showdown that
you're losing by not showing up!

184
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,484
He's telling a
huge-gantic audience

185
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,112
that you're a ding-dong so
he can steal all your fans!

186
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,964
- That settles it, Keiko.

187
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,032
Make me virulent
on the onternet.

188
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,744
I'm looking at this
internet thing,

189
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,663
and it's hilarious! Look!

190
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:19,958
This cartoon baby is dancing
just like a grown-up!

191
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,711
That meme is older
than my teacher,

192
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,713
and she knits.

193
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,427
: Ollo,
fans. I am here,

194
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:32,178
talking into the camera

195
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:35,098
as if I were talking
to you in person.

196
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:38,727
Thanks to the magic
of the onternet.

197
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,812
Maybe need a catchphrase.
Something like,

198
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,189
"Villains are red,
heroes are blue.

199
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:46,860
Stop robbing that bank,
or feel my kung fu!"

200
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,379
Or, you know, I'll think
of something later.

201
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,196
Sir! Have you seen
this unusual fellow

202
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,674
- who sings about rain made of...
- Chum!

203
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,744
- Okay, Chum,
you gotta stop watching

204
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,388
old Internet stuff
while we're filming.

205
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:59,497
And Megamind, be
more natural, dude.

206
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,666
You're moving your arms
like a floppy inflatable

207
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,209
- at a used car lot.
- Keiko,

208
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:05,962
I'm unfamiliar with
the glare of a lens.

209
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,048
I'm more of a live
performance guy.

210
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,759
You know, theater!
Treading the boards!

211
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,802
Well, I'm certainly bored,

212
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,930
but this is for a web channel,
not Shakespeare in the Park.

213
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,391
- Just move your arms normal.
- So, more like...

214
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:21,561
Hello, my biggest
fans! Megamind here.

215
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:24,147
Perfect! We'll go with
that. Roll camera.

216
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,317
: Hello,
my biggest fans!

217
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:28,485
Your little fannies

218
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,322
will shake as you worship
the splendor that is...

219
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:35,325
Keiko: You're doing the arm thing
again and saying weird stuff.

220
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,911
: Ugh! I don't know
what you want from me, Keiko!

221
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:40,455
Actually, maybe just
do something heroic.

222
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,500
Heroic opportunities don't just
walk out into the street and

223
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,545
Or sometimes they do.

224
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,969
DeGravity should do.

225
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:03,812
Ha-ha! Um, citizen?

226
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,648
What are you watching that
had you so distracted?

227
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:07,816
Dude Monkey.

228
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,236
- Whoa! You watchin' my vids, bud?
- What the?!

229
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,571
Oh, wow! It's
really Dude Monkey!

230
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:16,157
You're such an inspiration.
Can I get a selfie?

231
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,451
How about a self-photograph
with the hero who,

232
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,371
- you know, saved your life?
- Nah, I'm good.

233
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:24,040
- Say, "Megamind's cheugy!"

234
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:27,127
Say, "Megamind's cheugy!"

235
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:29,087
Keiko: I'll just
edit that stuff out.

236
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:30,964
- We will beat Dude Monkey

237
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,758
to an onternet pulp
with this video, right?

238
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,635
This rescue was awesome!

239
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,972
Once people see this, they're
gonna be all, "Who-Monkey"?

240
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,849
- We're just gonna upload and wait.

241
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,976
Ooh! I got a view!

242
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:45,228
- That was from you watching it.

243
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,397
Be patient. Your
fans will find you.

244
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,816
I gotta head home.
My mom's super strict

245
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:51,484
- about my 9 p.m. curfew.

246
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,778
- Another view!
- Keiko: Also from you!

247
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,071
Oh...

248
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,785
- Come on, come on...

249
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,455
- A new meme!
- Ah! How many views?

250
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,998
Oh. False alarm.

251
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,042
It's just an old
one with new words.

252
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,419
Only 100 views?

253
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:12,505
Why haven't I
become a virus yet?

254
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,758
I know it hasn't
exploded overnight,

255
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:16,509
but you need to be patient.

256
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,803
We need to build
something unique to you.

257
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,598
The video where that monkey
man does the troll to me.

258
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:24,309
- How many does that have?
- A couple more.

259
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,269
- Yeah, a million more.

260
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,396
It's as if I don't exist!

261
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,899
I'm far from
inspirational. I've become

262
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,859
unpopular.

263
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:36,029
- Your fans will find you. We just need...
- Thank you, Keiko,

264
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:37,489
but I know how to handle this.

265
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,408
Chum, we've got a
"Class Me" emergency.

266
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,203
The only thing that will
get me out of this spiral

267
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:45,955
is a whiz-bang appearance
at a fish museum!

268
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:47,749
The kids will love it!

269
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:50,168
Yeah, my heart's racing already.

270
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:54,798
You know, I have some great
ideas for this aquarium gig.

271
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:56,758
- Hyah! Woo!
- Ow!

272
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,427
Really wanna see your face
when she tells you this.

273
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,804
Go ahead, ma'am.

274
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:04,057
The aquarium board is

275
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:05,493
made up of people
with terrible taste

276
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:07,310
who are kind of leaning
toward Dude Monkey.

277
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:10,271
No! Any dude or any monkey,

278
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:11,564
but not him!

279
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,858
You gotta see his
latest, though!

280
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:17,153
Dude Monkey: Dude Monkey
stops crime with a meat-sicle!

281
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,200
Hey! My wallet!

282
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,160
'Sup, Dude Monkerinos!

283
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:28,206
Pretty much gonna declare myself
Metro City's greatest hero.

284
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,291
Crime is poppin', but Megamind

285
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,877
is
a-prune juice shoppin'!

286
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:38,425
- Thanks, Dude Monkey!
- I schtopped a crime!

287
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,260
Hey, quick, shout out
to my primo sponsor,

288
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:41,928
Mr. Minion's Meat-sicles,

289
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:43,805
the official meat-sicle
of Dude Monkey.

290
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,432
Yumalamadingdong!

291
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:47,642
I can't believe
he has a sponsor!

292
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,687
- Why don't I have a sponsor?
- You got me.

293
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:53,231
I think a wart removal cream
would be blessed to have you.

294
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:55,150
Hilarious, Christina.

295
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:57,861
Hey, that guy is charismatic,

296
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,071
but he's no Megamind.

297
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,823
I'll keep fighting for you.

298
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:04,492
I'll make it easy. If Dude
Monkey's catching fire,

299
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,871
I'm gonna become a
crime-stopping megaton bomb!

300
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:11,166
That's a metaphor for having
an engaging web channel,

301
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,292
not a threat.

302
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,961
Ma'am, they've
spotted Nighty-Knight!

303
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,630
That aquarium board
will change their mind

304
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:19,632
when I bring
Nighty-Knight to justice

305
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:22,052
and knock Dude
Monkey's web channel

306
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:24,137
on its weird monkey butt!

307
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:28,641
I've been studying what
makes Dude Monkey so popular.

308
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,935
If this is the hero
Metrocity wants me to be,

309
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:33,396
then so shall I be it!

310
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,523
- Hey, radical duderoos.

311
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,734
Megamind here. Crimes a-poppin'!

312
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:40,153
- Dang.
- Help! Help!

313
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:43,323
Scope that! Crime
much, am I right?

314
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,867
You'll L-O-L as I
trick-shot these handcuffs

315
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,078
right on Nighty-Knight's wrists.

316
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:52,457
- Hey! That's my fishbowl!

317
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:56,252
- Hm.
- Oh, I think you just missed his wrist, sir.

318
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:58,088
By which I mean entirely.

319
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,568
- We gonna let him steal meat-sicle carts?

320
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,886
Nah. Crime stopping rocks!

321
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:08,723
- Ow!

322
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,975
- Crime-a-Doodle-Don't!

323
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:12,435
Hizzle, cowpokes.

324
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,396
Just call me Dead-Eye Blue

325
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,815
because when I take
my shot at baddies,

326
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,483
I never miss.

327
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:19,818
Backslash rad!

328
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:21,943
- Guard: He's got the blueprints!

329
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:26,616
Ha-ha! Well, howdy,
Nighty-Knight!

330
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,660
- Ah!
- Ah! Chum!

331
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:31,538
It's like all-new memes,

332
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:34,165
but with that special
homemade flavor!

333
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,501
Keiko! I demand you
burn all copies.

334
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:39,170
I should come off
as inspirational,

335
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,131
not as some bumbling buffoon.

336
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:43,800
Come on! It's funny stuff!

337
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,027
Your fans are gonna see this

338
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,012
and mash that subscribe
button so hard,

339
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:48,722
you could serve it with gravy.

340
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:52,350
Keiko, I'm
repositioning you.

341
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,394
I'll be taking over
advising myself,

342
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:57,147
and you'll organize
my jazz albums.

343
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:59,357
But you don't have
any jazz albums, sir.

344
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:01,234
Then this should
be easy for her.

345
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:04,821
But you don't even know how
to post or log on or stream!

346
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:07,073
- Jazz albums!

347
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:11,036
Imagine her telling me I
don't know what I'm doing.

348
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:12,746
Now, to get rid of these videos.

349
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:16,833
- Gonna upload them right into the trash.

350
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,626
Hasta la vista, videos!

351
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:21,838
Sir, I think you may
need to see this.

352
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:24,025
Dude Monkey : Yo, yo,
yo, yo, yo, Dude Monkerinos!

353
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:26,801
Just got a call from
the mayor's office.

354
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,846
I've been requested to
appear at the grand reopening

355
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,097
of the aquarium!

356
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:32,349
And you know what?

357
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:35,060
I beat Megamind for the gig!

358
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:37,604
Now I'm gonna dance all over
this picture of Megamind

359
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:40,273
until a-millio eyeballs
are on this stream!

360
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:44,110
Bananalamadingdong!

361
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,158
He's still dancing
after two hours.

362
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,785
Incredible.

363
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,204
I need a 30-minute nap after
eating three chicken wings.

364
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:56,539
- Well, well, well.

365
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,249
On my way to the hospital.

366
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,794
My back is lousy
with stab wounds.

367
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,047
I'm truly sorry about
the Dude Monkey thing.

368
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:05,548
It was out of my hands.

369
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:07,759
What fun is having
my friend as mayor

370
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,803
if I don't get
everything I want?

371
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:12,222
I was elected to be
the mayor of the city,

372
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:13,348
not just my friends.

373
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:16,267
And the city wants Dude Monkey,

374
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:19,229
which I agree is
dumb.

375
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:21,564
Dumb-ocracy. Am I right?

376
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:25,944
You can't unspoil my sour mood
with mayoral dad jokes, Roxie.

377
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:28,196
- Christina: Mm! Mm!

378
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,948
Hey, come on!

379
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:31,908
Bananalamadingdong.

380
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:35,620
I possess super intelligence,

381
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:39,582
otherworldly handsomeness,
and selfless humility.

382
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:43,169
Yet, I am felled by
a bananalamadingdong.

383
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:45,005
You uploaded your blooper reel?

384
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,881
I hope the answer is no.

385
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:48,758
The answer is yes.

386
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:51,469
It is up, and it is
huger than a luger!

387
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,513
You're getting
Dude Monkey numbers

388
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:55,598
and netting more
subs every second.

389
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:58,393
Ow! Crime-a-Doodle-Don't!

390
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,770
Oh, terrific.

391
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:02,689
The whole city must
be laughing at me.

392
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:04,357
Just look at the comments.

393
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:06,234
Little Terry Sasko says,

394
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,279
"I love that Megamind
messes up just like me.

395
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:11,364
In a weird way,
that's inspiring."

396
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:13,867
Inspiring? Well,
that's what I want,

397
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:16,619
but this feels like
what I don't want.

398
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:18,997
This is what your channel needs.

399
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:20,665
Everyone wants to be a hero.

400
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,250
So when a hero makes a mistake,

401
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,420
that's fun to see because
everyone makes mistakes.

402
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,255
If you wanna inspire your fans,

403
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,924
we need to show them
everything, warts and all.

404
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:32,010
Maybe you're right.

405
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:35,764
And perhaps I was a little
harsh on you earlier.

406
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:36,889
You think?

407
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:39,559
I'm promoting you back
to your previous position

408
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:42,103
as my adviser of all
things onternetty.

409
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,355
Do I get a raise?

410
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:46,858
- I wasn't paying you before.
- I had to try.

411
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:49,235
You know, I find
it a little fishy

412
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:52,739
that Nighty-Knight would want
to steal a... Wait a second!

413
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:54,300
- Nighty-Knight!

414
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:55,760
Oh, I'm a fool for not
seeing this earlier.

415
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:57,994
I was so focused on
being onternet cool,

416
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,996
I let him slip
through my fingers!

417
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:01,289
We have to stop him!

418
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:04,167
But it's impossible to know
where he'll strike next.

419
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:05,377
No, it's not, Chum.

420
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:07,170
Nighty-Knight is making a play

421
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:08,713
for the diamond koi fish.

422
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:11,424
Sir, don't you think you're
jumping to conclusions?

423
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:13,593
No! Keiko, bring up my bloopers.

424
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:16,012
- Hey! That's my fishbowl!

425
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:18,640
Pause it! He's
stealing a fishbowl!

426
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:21,226
Perhaps he wants an
unconventional candy dish.

427
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:22,519
Keiko, run it.

428
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:24,521
Backslash rad!

429
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:25,646
- Pause!

430
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,899
Now, zoom in! There!

431
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:30,485
The blueprints for the aquarium!

432
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:32,946
Please. Who doesn't have those?

433
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:36,574
Megamind: He's going to sneak
himself in inside a meat-sicle cart!

434
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,245
Maybe we should focus on what
Nighty-Knight is actually up to.

435
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,914
- Keiko, enhance audio.

436
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,833
Nighty-Knight: My darkly
dark plan to steal

437
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,335
the diamond-encrusted koi
during the reopening ceremony

438
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,630
will be a... drowning success.

439
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:56,928
Okay, I'm convinced. The
"muahaha" did it for me.

440
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,222
To the aquarium!

441
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,023
Alright now! Now the D-Monk's

442
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:11,359
gonna upchuck some smarts
all over you Monkerinos!

443
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:15,989
Aquariums
are like superheroes.

444
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:19,701
They both are things
people like to look at,

445
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:22,120
and also both things that
make people happy, too.

446
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:23,889
- Please give me good news.

447
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,749
Like, a meteor is
heading this way,

448
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:27,667
so I don't have to
listen to this speech.

449
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:30,003
Nighty-Knight's coming
for the koi fish!

450
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:32,213
If you see a meat-sicle
cart, clear it out.

451
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:35,925
Dude Monkey: Lungs like
humans do. They have gills.

452
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:39,137
We need to clear
out all meat-sicle carts.

453
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:42,390
Security. We need help clearing
out the meat-sicle carts.

454
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:46,144
Hey!

455
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:52,734
Eternal doom awaits all who
come between Nighty-Knight

456
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:56,112
and his fishy bowl of... doom!

457
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:03,203
Let's schtop a crime!

458
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:08,333
Dude, awesome costume!

459
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,669
Alright, let's do this
just like we practiced.

460
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:14,172
Some light sparring, and then
I totally crush you. Ready?

461
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:18,551
You dare talk confusingly

462
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:20,762
to the Duke of Darkness?

463
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,640
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, Brad!

464
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:25,809
We so do not have
the budget for this!

465
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:27,894
Wait. You're not Brad.

466
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,938
You're really
Nighty-Knight!

467
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:34,442
Crowd: Run! It's Nighty-Knight!

468
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,820
- Hey, guys.

469
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:41,199
Welcome to "Megamind's Rules
For Defending Your City!"

470
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:44,202
How do you like that title,
Keiko? Is it onternetty?

471
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:47,914
So onternetty. I think
you're starting to get this.

472
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:51,251
By the way, where is Dude
Monkey in this moment of need?

473
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:52,502
Bad Guy Brad: Oh...

474
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:54,254
Here you are, dude!

475
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:56,423
Dude, you were supposed
to stage the heist

476
00:20:56,548 --> 00:20:57,674
like we rehearsed!

477
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:00,093
I don't know how to
stop real criminals!

478
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:03,304
Dude, you just got
ousted as a fraud.

479
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:06,683
Dude!

480
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:09,185
I had a feeling Dude
Monkey was a phony.

481
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,980
I assure all you
former Monkerinos,

482
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:15,692
as Metro City's defender,
I will never lie to you.

483
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:19,738
- Yoo-hoo! Wannabe spooky dude!
- Nighty-Knight: Megamind!

484
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:22,449
Your pathetic
attempts to foil my

485
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:24,242
Wha...

486
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:36,046
- Pretty chill, homeboy.

487
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:38,506
- Thank you. Thank you.

488
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:41,426
Oh, please, no! You're too much.

489
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:43,928
- But it is fitting.

490
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:51,519
I appreciate the applause,

491
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:55,607
but I also really need
you to like and subscribe!

492
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:58,109
Sir! I made my own meme!

493
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:01,988
- Pretty chill, homeboy.

494
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:04,157
Ol' Chum: I think
you've gone viral, sir!

495
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:07,577
I look positively infectious!

496
00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:09,079
Guard: Megamind!

497
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:11,831
Someone just stole a genetically
altered starfish from the lab!

498
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:13,458
A what?

499
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:22,217
My quest was darkly bountiful,

500
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:23,718
most vile one.

501
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:26,638
The starfish.

502
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:29,766
Able to regenerate its
body if it loses a limb.

503
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:32,727
This holds the genetic
key that will allow me

504
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:36,564
to rise to power once again!

505
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:39,067
Soon, I will remind Megamind

506
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:42,070
how good it feels to be bad!
