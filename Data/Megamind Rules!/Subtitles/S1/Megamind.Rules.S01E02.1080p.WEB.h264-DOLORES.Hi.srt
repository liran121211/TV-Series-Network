[beep, static]

16
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,008
Citizens of Metrocity,
I need your help!

17
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,844
I've been kidnaped by one
who I used to call friend.

18
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:56,139
And now, they're torturing
me ever so cruelly!

19
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:59,059
Calm down, Captain Hysteria.

20
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,895
I wanted to surprise you for
all the hard work you're doing.

21
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,521
Don't you like surprises?

22
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,815
I have no problem
with surprises.

23
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,526
It's just the ones that come
out of nowhere and surprise you.

24
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:11,529
So, you just don't like
surprising surprises.

25
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:13,907
(groans) The tension
is unbearable!

26
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,326
Just let me guess what
it is. A bigger statue?

27
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,036
Plutonium? A bouquet of puppies?

28
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:21,331
Tell me. Wait! Don't tell
me. I retract that! Tell me!

29
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,583
- Okay, before you explode.
- (sighs)

30
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:24,876
Ta-da!

31
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,378
- (gentle music playing)
- (gasps)

32
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:30,340
Sweet, shimmering Shangri-La!

33
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:32,258
I know you've become a fan

34
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:34,219
since Chum helped
revamp the place, and

35
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,054
(excited panting) Oh... Okay.

36
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:39,265
Ooh! I want that one!
No, I want that one!

37
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:41,935
Oh, so many choices!

38
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,940
Well, who says you gotta choose just
one? (Laughs) - Megamind: Mr. Donut!

39
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,981
Roxanne, it's Mr. Donut!

40
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,567
Did my outfit give it away?

41
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:50,735
(laughing)

42
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,987
You're witnessing a
master at work, Roxanne.

43
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,532
Look! He juggles donuts as
well as he deep fries them.

44
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,200
Mr. Donut: Yeah, I do!

45
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,660
Ho ho ho ho!

46
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,036
- Ho!
- Whoa!

47
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:02,288
Oh! (Gasps) The precision!

48
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:05,083
- Then you are gonna love this!
- (gasps)

49
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:08,003
Who's this beautiful creature?

50
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,796
That is our new Megadonut.

51
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:13,258
My tribute to the
city's greatest hero.

52
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,885
You, sir, are an artist.

53
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,012
Who would have imagined?

54
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,638
A few weeks ago,

55
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:21,224
this place was just
another greasy diner.

56
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,977
But whether it's
week-old soup or donuts,

57
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,855
whenever fate points
me in a new direction,

58
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,190
I dive in 100%!

59
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:34,195
Well, this donut is about
to 100% dive into my belly.

60
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,656
Well, since you hate
surprises so much,

61
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,450
maybe we'll skip the next one.

62
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,327
Tell me what it is! I beg you!

63
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,580
Easy! I have arranged
for Mr. Donut

64
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,415
to give us a little tour.

65
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,418
Mr. Donut: Usually, I like to
keep my baking process a secret,

66
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,337
but I think I can
make an exception

67
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:53,590
for the defender of
Metro City. Follow me.

68
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:57,302
Ah-ah, I almost forgot.
No eating in the kitchen.

69
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:58,667
This'll give you time to digest

70
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,889
the seven donuts you
had on the way over.

71
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:02,932
Fine

72
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:04,768
(brainbots beeping)
Business is booming!

73
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,936
Though, it would be nice
to spend a little more time

74
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:08,062
with the wife and kids.

75
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:11,608
Psst! Hey, buddy. What
are you waiting for?

76
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,973
- (dreamy music playing)
- Don't you want to take a bite?

77
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,488
(whispers) Of course.
I want nothing more!

78
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:17,933
Mr. Donut: Did
you say something?

79
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:21,743
(conveyor belt rattling) - (normal)
Uh, I-I said, "Please tell us more."

80
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,567
This is all just the beginning.

81
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,206
Got some big plans
for expanding.

82
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,792
First across town, then
across the country.

83
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:32,295
Before you know it, Mr. Donut's
gonna take over the world!

84
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,172
Megadonut: Ollo...

85
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,633
My sweet, gooey
flesh is yearning

86
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,760
for those pearly chompers.

87
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,304
Ugh, you're clearly just
my donut-loving imagination

88
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:43,056
playing tricks on me.

89
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:46,810
And here's the secret
to the whole operation.

90
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,437
My famous sticky glaze.

91
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,648
You've saved my Metrocity twice.

92
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,317
Surely you deserve one bite.

93
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:57,445
That is airtight
logic. Ah... (grunts)

94
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,370
(quietly) You have the
self-control of a puppy

95
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,740
around a sloppy toddler.

96
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,242
He said no eating.

97
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,911
Roxanne, both you and the
donut make good arguments,

98
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,288
except if I listen to
you, I get nothing.

99
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,333
(both struggling)

100
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:12,846
- (tense music playing)
- (slow motion gasp)

101
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:13,877
(splat)

102
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:15,922
(both gasp)

103
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,718
(both sigh)

104
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:22,429
And you'll find this
interesting. The vat actually

105
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:25,348
(screaming)
- (dramatic music playing)

106
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:26,349
(Megamind, Roxanne gasp)

107
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:27,559
We have to save him!

108
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:30,186
No donut baker dies on my watch.

109
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:33,148
(triumphant music playing)

110
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,733
(squishing)

111
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,443
(Roxanne yelps)

112
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:37,986
- Mr. Donut!
- (squishing)

113
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:41,698
- Are you okay?
- (sighs)

114
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,908
I think I slipped on jelly.

115
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,453
But how could that
have happened?

116
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,329
Both: Uh...

117
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,539
(siren wails)

118
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,458
All his vitals are fine.

119
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,961
- He's just really sticky.
- (stethoscope snaps)

120
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,589
I guess he could
just hold on to that.

121
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,216
I think now would be a good time

122
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:01,426
to apologize to Mr. Donut.

123
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,262
You're the one who
grabbed my arm!

124
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,931
Fine. We'll do this together.

125
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:07,932
(gentle music playing)

126
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,185
Mr. Donut, we owe
you an apology.

127
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,437
Roxanne's blatant rule-following

128
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,814
caused me to squirt the jelly.

129
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,861
(weakly) I'll pay
you back for this.

130
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,112
That's not good.

131
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:23,448
What did he say?
Everything okay?

132
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,076
Actually, I'm afraid
things have gone

133
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:29,788
- from bad to evil.
- (dramatic crescendo)

134
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,289
Whoa! Oh!

135
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,583
- (static)
- Citizens of Metrocity,

136
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:37,003
you're about to see something
rarely captured on film.

137
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:40,840
The origin of a supervillain
out in the wild.

138
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,092
Roll it!

139
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,220
(weakly) I'll pay
you back for this.

140
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,263
- Ah, ha!
- (grunts)

141
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:48,932
What are you up to?

142
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:52,894
- Mr. Donut is the nicest person ever.
- Oh, really?

143
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,272
Do nice guys admit their
plans for world domination?

144
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:57,691
- Exhibit A.
- (beep)

145
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:59,984
Mr. Donut's gonna
take over the world!

146
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,945
(dramatic sting)

147
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,739
Is your head also
filled with jelly?

148
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,367
He just meant that he wants
to expand his business.

149
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,452
His business is badness,

150
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,621
and Mr. Donut is all in.

151
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,206
- Exhibit B!
- (beep)

152
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,875
- But whether it's week-old soup or donuts...
- (beep)

153
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:17,919
- Megamind (dubbed): Or evil!
- (beep)

154
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,296
I dive in 100%!

155
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:23,299
(Megamind laughs evilly)

156
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:26,636
That's not even his evil
laugh. That's your evil laugh.

157
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,555
I don't know what
you're talking about.

158
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,807
(on video) Chum, how
is my evil laugh?

159
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,727
You're assuming he's
going to turn evil

160
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:36,438
because he fell
into a vat of glaze?

161
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:37,563
That's crazy.

162
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,774
Crazy like a fox in a lab coat.

163
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,068
Because it's based on
something called science.

164
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:44,446
- (typing, beep)
- He's right, Roxie.

165
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,114
A hero accidentally
creating a nemesis

166
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,782
by causing them to
fall into something

167
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,243
is a well-known villain
trope going back to the '50s.

168
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:53,913
Name one example where someone
literally created a nemesis

169
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:56,332
- by knocking them into something.
- Keiko: Got it.

170
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,210
"Top 10 times where someone
literally created a nemesis

171
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,837
by knocking them
into something."

172
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,214
Ugh, the internet's the worst.

173
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,924
Behemoth fell into a volcano,

174
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,344
the Cosmetologist fell
into a tub of mascara,

175
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:10,347
Leopardman fell into a cage of

Chum, you worked with Mr. Donut.
What's your impression?

180

Oh, he was a great boss.

181
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,653
Although, he did demand
100% from his workers.

182

from good to bad. Ooh!

00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:25,702
- Cool!
- Yeah, you did it, Dad!

519
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:27,495
Hey, my little munchkins!

520
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,457
Guess we caught the "hole" gang.

521
00:21:30,582 --> 00:21:33,126
You know, like donut
holes! (Laughs)

522
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:36,588
I stepped on the nice
moment, didn't I?

523
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:38,631
According to Megamind,

524
00:21:38,757 --> 00:21:40,842
Mr. Donut was working undercover

525
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:43,803
to help him nab the
notorious Go Fish Gang.

526
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:47,682
- Job well done to Metro City's newest and unlikeliest hero.
- (siren wailing)

527
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,936
Another tray for my
favorite customers.

528
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:55,273
(sighs) Great to see Mr. Donut
back and better than ever.

529
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:56,775
And not only that,

530
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,153
I figured out a way to spend
more time with the family.

531
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,113
Here you go.

532
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,657
- There's nothing better than free labor.
- (kicks)

533
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:07,118
And family togetherness.

534
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:09,913
I think maybe there's also
a lesson to be learned

535
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:12,457
- from all of this.
- That reminds me!

536
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:14,584
I just want to
say to all my fans

537
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:18,505
that I think Mayor Ritchi
has learned a valuable lesson

538
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:21,257
about assuming the
worst in people.

539
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:23,551
Hey! I was on his side.

540
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:25,387
For a majority of the time.

541
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:27,889
The important truth is
the kind of person we are

542
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:30,225
comes down to the
decisions we make.

543
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:33,103
For example, right now,
I'm regretting the decision

544
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:35,355
to eat 20 donuts.

545
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,900
Come on, big guy.
What's one more bite?

546
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:40,985
How could I ever disappoint you,

547
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:44,364
my little delicious
blue friends? (Chomp)
