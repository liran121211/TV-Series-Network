00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:54,095
making a fool outta
you, Megamind.

13
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,056
And thanks for the isotopes.

14
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:58,266
You mean these isotopes?

15
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,226
Who's the fool now?

16
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,980
Pierre: It would appear
you are Monsieur Fool!

17
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,697
Time to spin this in my favor.

18
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:20,413
Looks like someone skipped
a well-balanced breakfast.

19
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:24,584
I just have coffee. Dark blend.

20
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,297
Come on, Megamind. You got this.

21
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,217
Okay, I don't got this!

22
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:35,011
Nighty-Knight: Around
and around you go!

23
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,097
Oh, wait. I got it!

24
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:39,140
Ah! My eyes!

25
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:41,935
Ah!

26
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,436
Don't fall asleep on the job!

27
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,563
Megamind: Know this.

28
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:49,359
I will not rest until
I get those isotopes!

29
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:53,613
But first, maybe
a quick power nap.

30
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,950
As per your ordinance,

31
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:59,285
we have slept

32
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,496
swept this city clean.

33
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:04,332
- And the isotopes?
- That I lost,

34
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,459
mostly because we were sweeping,

35
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,754
but I will not rest until
I've recovered them,

36
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,673
- Roberta.
- Roxie.

37
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:14,801
I'm Megamind. You're
Roxie, Roberta.

38
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:18,763
- Uh, is his brain broken?
- How would we tell?

39
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:22,642
You've been chasing
villains all night.

40
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:23,935
You should go to bed.

41
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,812
Hopefully a right-side-up one.

42
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,397
Heroes don't rest.

43
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,483
Now, I really have to
get back to the lair.

44
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:33,153
Keiko: Um, this is
your lair, buddy.

45
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:36,656
Ah, yes, of course.
Thank you, Chum.

46
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,467
- If Megamind
doesn't get some rest,

47
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:41,661
he's gonna have a
complete Mega-meltdown.

48
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,831
And those are never
pretty. But not to worry.

49
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:47,584
I'll have him shipshape
on the good ship Shipshape

50
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:51,004
- in no time.
- I know you will, Chum.

51
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,506
- He really needs some rest.

52
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,759
Ma'am, you have a full day
of wall-to-wall meetings.

53
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,011
Keiko, Chum, this has been
a confusing waste of time,

54
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,346
per usual.

55
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,015
Well, you and I should
be able to handle things

56
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:04,184
while Megamind rests
and recuperates.

57
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,353
I've got his beloved
binky right here.

58
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,438
First of all, he uses a binky?

59
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,856
Like a little baby?

60
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,441
Don't tell him I told you.

61
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:13,109
But, yes, it does
help him relax.

62
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:16,279
That's a fun fact our followers
don't need to know about.

63
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,697
Anyway, it's a school day, bro.

64
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,366
I'm only here for
the toaster pastries.

65
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,826
Oh, but he's in pretty
bad shape, Keiko.

66
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,204
I don't know if I can
take care of him alone.

67
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,040
I'll come back right
when school is out

68
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:28,625
and give you a
hand. But, come on.

69
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,377
You're Chum. You've got this.

70
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,256
Izzy Iggy, lead
singer of Facemelter,

71
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,133
is doing a show in town!

72
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,219
Sir's gonna want
tickets for sure.

73
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,473
I love this song!

74
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:46,518
♪ Put your hands up
high, grab the air ♪

75
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,687
♪ Clap your hands, like
you just don't care ♪

76
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,939
♪ Stomp your feet on
the cement floor ♪

77
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,315

78
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,692
- Chum,

79
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,277
I cannot let myself
be distracted

80
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,364
by the smooth sounds and
velvety voice of Izzy Iggy!

81
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,032
There's work to do!

82
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,743
- Sir, you
should be in bed relaxing.

83
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,453
Here, take your binky.

84
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,623
Oh, I don't need to relax,
and I don't need my binky.

85
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,917
What I need is to
create a simulation

86
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,378
of every possible move the
Doom Syndicate could make!

87
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,673
This will keep me a good
six to seven steps ahead.

88
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:20,051
- Okay...
- But not only that, I need to create a simulation

89
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,679
of every possible move the
Doom Syndicate could make.

90
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:26,224
This will keep me a good
six to seven steps ahead.

91
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,851
Ooh! A butterfly!

92
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:30,770
How did you even get in here,
you silly little bug fairy, you?

93
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,940
He may not know
it, but this Izzy Iggy show

94
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,776
is exactly what Sir needs
to recharge his batteries.

95
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:40,905
"Remaining Izzy tickets only
available at the box office."

96
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,532
Huh...

97
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,367
He'd probably be fine by himself

98
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,369
if I stepped out
for just a second.

99
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:51,166
Although I don't agree
with your politics,

100
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,126
that is too funny, Butterfly.

101
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:54,669
Or maybe not.

102
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,672
How can I get those
tickets and care for Sir?

103
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,925
Oh, I could really use an
assistant of my own today.

104
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,220
Huh...

105
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,638
Alright, cloning machine.

106
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,432
Let's make another
me to watch Sir

107
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,601
- while I grab those tickets!

108
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,603
- Just need a little DNA.

109
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:18,193
Sir could use a little
more attention than usual,

110
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:21,154
so I'll adjust the
new me just a skosh.

111
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:22,697
I'm already smart enough,

112
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:26,451
so let's trade some
intelligence for persistence.

113
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:39,214
Oh, very handsome!

114
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,508
I shall call you Chum Two.

115
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:44,844
Must be because I'm too
ready to serve, Sir!

116
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,349
Well, I'm glad I didn't
skimp on my witty repartee.

117
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,435
- Ah! Stop hitting me!

118
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,604
Okay then. Try to
get him to rest

119
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:56,356
while I'm off on my
errand to help him,

120
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:57,816
you know, rest.

121
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:58,858
Oh!

122
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,528
Uh, in case it rains
on your journey.

123
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:04,197
- Well, thank you!
- And here's your lunch.

124
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,700
Oh, I should be back in a jiff.

125
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,744
Ah-ah! No one's ever been
sorry they brought a lunch.

126
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,579
I never thought of it that way.

127
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,833
Or actually, I suppose I did.

128
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:17,711
I can't say why,

129
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,588
but what I'm seeing makes me
believe the Doom Syndicate

130
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,009
is building a giant
radioactive banana.

131
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,969
Diabolical! Hey!

132
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,554
What the?!

133
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:30,098
No rest is for the wicked, Sir.

134
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,350
And you are not wicked. Anymore.

135
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,352
- Here we go. And...

136
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,313
What are you... It
doesn't recline!

137
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,107
- Not with that attitude.

138
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:40,567
Whoa!

139
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,485
Explain yourself, Chum!

140
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,070
Chum Two: Oh, my apologies, Sir.

141
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,989
Allow me to relax you.

142
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,453
- Would you please go away?!

143
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,538
I'm letting Sir down.

144
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,749
Not Sir would be
so disappointed.

145
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,500
How do I make up for
two disappointments

146
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,586
when there's just one me?

147
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,588
- Huh.

148
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:04,382
- Clerk: Next.

149
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,427
Good day, employed citizen.
I would like to purchase

150
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:09,888
two tickets to the
Izzy Iggy show, please.

151
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,765
It's a lottery.

152
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,476
Is that like, "It's a vibe"?

153
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,020
Clerk: No. It means
I give you a number,

154
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:19,522
and then we'll randomly
call out numbers,

155
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,524
and those people
will get a chance

156
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,860
to buy the two
remaining tickets.

157
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,364
14? My lucky number!

158
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:30,784
That's the age I was when Sir
first said "thank you" to me.

159
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:34,954
Congratulations.
Wait over there.

160
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:35,997
And next!

161
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,960
Tuna? I hate tuna.

162
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,880
- Other me should know that.

163
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:46,299
Lair of Megamind!
This is Chum Two.

164
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:47,634
I just wanted to check in.

165
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:49,636
You gave me tuna,
which I do not eat,

166
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:51,846
and I was worried that
adjusting your personality

167
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,199
- might have been...
- Chum Two: Please hold!

168
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,433
Wait, wait, wait! Don't
put the hold music on!

169
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,106
♪ Put your hands up
high, grab the air ♪

170
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,317
♪ Clap your hands, like
you just don't care ♪

171
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:05,819
- Whoa!
- S-Sorry!

172
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,363
I-I can't help but follow
instructional song lyrics.

173
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,199
- Christina Christo!

174
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,618
Chunk, right?

175
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,953
Chum, actually.

176
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,497
I'm just here getting
Izzy tickets for Megamind.

177
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,332
Well, Roxie asked me
to get two tickets

178
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:20,375
for her and Megamind.

179
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,502
She said she wanted
him to relax.

180
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:24,504
At a metal show? So weird.

181
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:27,090
Well, since I'm already
getting tickets for him,

182
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,884
you should probably call Roxie
and tell her Chum is on it.

183
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,762
I'd call myself, but I'm
on hold with... myself.

184
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:36,599
No, no, no. When she asks
me to do something, I do it.

185
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,184
That's why I'm the best.

186
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:41,062
I would never leave
anything in the hands of,

187
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:44,524
- well, you.
- I have never let Sir down,

188
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:47,694
so I kind of feel like
I can handle this.

189
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,654
Driver: Nice moves, weirdo!

190
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:53,033
Thank you! Can't resist
instructional songs!

191
00:08:56,953 --> 00:09:00,040
I'm obviously too
flawed to keep Sir relaxed,

192
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,475
- but that can be fixed.

193
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:04,210
One perfectionist
Chum coming up!

194
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,928
Perfect!

195
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:18,266
- I'm writing an
extremely complicated code

196
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:20,435
that should ensure the
Doom Syndicate never again,

197
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:21,519
um...

198
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,646
I forget
what, but trust me!

199
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,482
It's gonna be the hottest thing

200
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,317
since sliced beds.

201
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:29,611
- Much too close to the screen, Sir.
- Ah!

202
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,154
You'll damage your eyes.

203
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:33,531
Oh, and look at this
unkempt workspace.

204
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,576
My code!

205
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:39,996
That was really
complicated and important!

206
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:40,997
I think.

207
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,458
Killing germs is important, Sir.

208
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,502
I have no use for a clean freak.

209
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:49,381
I need someone who is
passionate about stopping crime.

210
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:52,717
Passion, you say?
I can do that, Sir!

211
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,262
- Oh, 'scuse me.

212
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,226
Let's do this!

213
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:05,480
What is this?
A crime simulation?!

214
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:06,981
Um, yes.

215
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:10,026
If I can cut the Syndicate
off here, they'll be trapped.

216
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:12,278
Yes! I'm on the edge of my seat!

217
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,948
- The tension is electrifying.

218
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,200
Right...

219
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:19,869
And so, if we
defeat them here...

220
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:22,539
We'll be heroes!

221
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,249
Yes...

222
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,543
But if I don't make
it here in time...

223
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,586
The world may end! No, no, no!

224
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:32,966
What are you doing?!

225
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:35,218
These markers
represent human beings!

226
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,721
How could you be so insensitive?

227
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:41,141
More sensitivity. Got it, Sir.

228
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,900
What's the matter now?

229
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:53,570
I tried to make you toast,

230
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,364
but I hurt the toast instead!

231
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:57,991
- Uh...

232
00:10:58,033 --> 00:11:00,869
- There, there.

233
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,413
The toaster was just on
the wrong calibration.

234
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:04,706
It could be fixed.

235
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:07,292
You should be happy, dear Chum.

236
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:10,920
Happy? Okay, Sir.

237
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:12,714
- Calibration?

238
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:15,175
Is my de-gun
properly calibrated?

239
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,593
Oh! The de-gun!

240
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,386
Are we gonna use
it to stop crime?

241
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,096
That would be so fun!

242
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:21,931
Okay...

243
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,308
When do we fight bad guys,

244
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,935
and how much fun will
that be? Scale of 1 to 10?

245
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:27,604
You know what you should do?

246
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:30,231
You should work on the, um,

247
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:33,568
- Invisible Car!
- Oh, yes! Yes!

248
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,278
It's the best day ever!

249
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,074
How am I supposed to work
with all this insanity?

250
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,743
I think Chum might need a nap.

251
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:43,620
What do you guys think?

252
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:46,289
Chums: We think you
could use a nap.

253
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:49,292
Why am I hearing
more than one...

254
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,710
Chums?

255
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:52,128
Chums: Hello!

256
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,674
- What is going on here?!

257
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:59,260
Ha! You, a better
assistant than moi?

258
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:02,639
For the 10th time,
I'm not an assistant.

259
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:03,973
I'm her chief of staff.

260
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:08,144
Then why are you fetching
concert tickets? Hmm?

261
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,398
Okay, fine. I sometimes
do assistanty things,

262
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,651
but when I do, I am far better
than you could even dream.

263
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:16,903
I can assist circles around you!

264
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:19,531
In fact, watch as I use
my superior assisting

265
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,366
to ensure I win this lottery.

266
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:22,742
Excuse me, good sir.

267
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:25,120
May I interest you in
my assisting services

268
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,247
in exchange for
your lottery number?

269
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:31,126
Well, I was supposed to
buy iguana food today...

270
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,879
Chum: Here you are, sir!

271
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,841
That was impressive!

272
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,300
Deal's a deal.

273
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,386
Looks like the
superior assistant

274
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:42,470
just doubled his chances

275
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,681
of getting the
tickets for his boss.

276
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:46,766
You best not think
you can best me.

277
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,352
I can do better than best you.

278
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:52,605
Well, then. Time for a good
old-fashioned assist-off.

279
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:55,692
- Half-caff,
light cream, two sugars,

280
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:58,028
stirred twice, and
hot, but not too hot.

281
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:00,280
Amazing! Now, I can
work on my essay.

282
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,781
- Speaking of which,

283
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,784
a complete history
of Pompeii! And look.

284
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,995
Graphs.

285
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:09,372
- Here you go.

286
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:11,708
Tiger did his business,
Spuds tired herself out,

287
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,127
and Dino sniffed out a fire.

288
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:16,379
- Thank you. Whoa, whoa!

289
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,137
- And spit, please, sir.

290
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:26,973
Tooth brushing! Will
wonders never cease?

291
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:33,146
I know what will turn that
blue frown upside down!

292
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:35,023
- Tickle fight!

293
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:37,609
I love that idea so much,
I'm going to marry it!

294
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,986
With Sir's blessing, of course.

295
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:44,115
Idea weddings
always make me cry!

296
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,701
Sir, if we have the
ceremony here at the lair,

297
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,578
it's a tax write-off!

298
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:54,167
Hey, I'm back! Just
like I promised... Whoa!

299
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:56,252
Chums: Keiko, everything
is under control!

300
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:59,839
Keiko! I just realized
what's going on here!

301
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:01,508
I'm dreaming!

302
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:04,028
- I'm very sure you're not dreaming.

303
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:05,970
And since we're
positive I'm dreaming,

304
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,722
I can do whatever I want!

305
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,432
Whee!

306
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:12,060
I never felt so free!

307
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:13,895
- Lemme make a wild guess here.

308
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:15,814
Chum made a clone
because he needed help,

309
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,565
and that clone made more clones.

310
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,693
And now, Megamind has
no concept of reality

311
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:22,862
because he's having a
complete Mega-meltdown!

312
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:24,447
No!

313
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,574
Well, actually, yes.

314
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:31,663
Anchor : Things are
growing dangerous downtown

315
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:35,041
- as a now 40-foot Behemoth rampages through Metr...

316
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,961
Oh, this dream is
only getting better!

317
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:40,088
I get to battle a
40-foot Behemoth

318
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,924
with my unlimited dream powers!

319
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:44,551
To the Invisible Car!

320
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:48,596
- Chums: Coming, Sir!
- You four stay here.

321
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,974
I'm gonna be his dream sherpa
and make sure he stays safe

322
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:52,284
and doesn't try anything stupid.

323
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,476
I'm gonna destroy Behemoth

324
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:55,729
with electric beams
from my eyeballs!

325
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,355
Dream power!

326
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:01,484
- You will never stop us from assisting our Sir!

327
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,368
That'll do.

328
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,163
Ah! Tell me you're normal Chum!

329
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:16,624
I just wanted to say
tweedle-dee dinglee-deedledee!

330
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,711
Because it's so fun to say
when you're happy like me!

331
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,296
Yeah!

332
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:23,673
Oh, definitely not normal Chum.

333
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:25,550
Listen up. This is my dream,

334
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,344
and I want to make
fighting Behemoth

335
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,387
be as fun as a dream
can make possible!

336
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,682
I know what's fun! We'll get
the new improved Invisible Car

337
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:34,225
and sneak up on Behemoth!

338
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,061
It'll be like a surprise party!

339
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,479
I don't think that's a...

340
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,939
Wait, that's actually
not a bad idea.

341
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:42,567
- And... voilàà!

342
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,529
This is perfect!

343
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,281
This is a disaster.

344
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:53,536
Okay, real talk.

345
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,138
You're heading to
battle with Behemoth,

346
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:57,791
and you do not have
magic dream powers!

347
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:01,419
Oh, you're way more fun
in real life, Keiko.

348
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,463
I'm flying in my dream!

349
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:05,965
- Whee!

350
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:09,052
- Oh no!

351
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:11,471
- Make the car invisible.
- Aw, but I wanna see

352
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:14,307
if we can make Behemoth
smile at its pretty colors!

353
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:18,144
We can stop it with the
dream power of happiness!

354
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:19,688
- No!
- Yes, we can.

355
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:24,150
- Ooh.

356
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:26,486
Pretty car.

357
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:29,906
-Aw, it
worked! We made him smile.

358
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:33,827
Behemoth smash pretty car!

359
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:39,082
Megamind: I never felt
nauseous in a dream before!

360
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:42,293
- It's not a dream!

361
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:45,005
Don't worry, bummer dream Keiko.

362
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:48,174
My electro-vision
will blast Behemoth!

363
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:52,345
Oh, please end well.
Please end well.

364
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:54,115
- Chum clone:
Sir! Let us help you!

365
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:55,432
I will rescue you!

366
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:59,519
Strike me down! Sir is
out there in danger!

367
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:03,273
And he doesn't even
have his binky!

368
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,984
The perfect
plan to help Sir.

369
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:10,113
I know it will come to us if
we just put our heads together!

370
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:12,615
Put our heads
together...

371
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:14,576
What if we use the
cloning machine

372
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:17,704
to combine our molecules,
lower all our attributes,

373
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:21,374
and maximize strength,
making one gigantic us!

374
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:32,260
I'm coming, Sir!

375
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,769
- Hi, Roxanne!
- Hi, Chum.

376
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,938
- Take that! And that!

377
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,066
- Who tickle Behemoth?

378
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:48,443
Megamind?

379
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:49,402
Huh?

380
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:51,279
I'll save you, Sir!

381
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:54,699
- Whoa!

382
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:57,494
- A great big Chum! Keiko!

383
00:17:57,535 --> 00:18:00,288
Isn't this the most
wonderful dream?!

384
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,749
You know what? I'm gonna
give in to the crazy.

385
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:05,460
- This kicks butt!
- You just relax, Sir.

386
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:07,796
I'll handle this.

387
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:16,346
Everything's giant
monsters these days.

388
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:19,474
Where's the remote?

389
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:29,192
Shh! Sir is trying to nap!

390
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:37,575
Ha! He did it! Megamind did it!

391
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:42,455
Megamind: Yes. Thank
you. You're all welcome.

392
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:44,374
He destroyed the streets again!

393
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,084
I can't get to work!

394
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:48,086
Even in my dream,

395
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:49,671
when I win, I lose.

396
00:18:49,713 --> 00:18:52,132
This city will be
the death of me.

397
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:56,428
This city will be
the death of him?

398
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,805
I have to act fast. I must

399
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:03,143
destroy the city
before it destroys Sir!

400
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:05,353
- Whoa! Ho!

401
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:13,737
- Huh?

402
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:14,946
Hm.

403
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,157
I'd be happy to help
anyone with anything!

404
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:18,616
I'll do twice her anything

405
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,678
- and be three times as happy about it!

406
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:23,997
Clerk: And the
final number is...

407
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:28,293
- 14.
- That's me. I win!

408
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:30,587
I'm the best
assistant in the city!

409
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:33,048
Ha, ha! Yes! Told
you! In your face!

410
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:34,674
- Huh?

411
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,223
I think Megamind might need
some top-notch assisting

412
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:44,476
right about now. You
take the tickets.

413
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:47,562
If I'm gonna lose, at least
it's to another assistant

414
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:49,189
and a really good one.

415
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:55,487
- Oh, my. Looks
like my plan went a little haywire.

416
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:59,491
He's finally resting, so
you kind of did your job.

417
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,284
- Sir...

418
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:04,579
- It's time to wake up, Sir.
- Oh, Chum.

419
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:07,540
- I had the craziest dream ever.

420
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:10,335
There were so many yous,
but not in a good way.

421
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:13,880
- Then, a giant you wrestled a mountain in the street.

422
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:16,966
Actually, it was real,
Sir. It all happened.

423
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:18,051
We're too late!

424
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:19,803
Until the city is flattened,

425
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:23,306
I don't think this MegaChum will
follow a single instruction!

426
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:25,058
That's a great idea, Sir!

427
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,269
There's one kind of
instruction no Chum can resist!

428
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:30,563
- MegaChum: Sorry!

429
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:33,066
Apologies, everyone.
Nothing personal.

430
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:35,360
Just have to destroy
everything real quick

431
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:37,529
before you become
the death of my Sir.

432
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:41,783
What is that?

433
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:49,499
♪ Raise your hands
like a crazy mutt ♪

434
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:52,168
♪ Be mellow, don't
crush Mr. Donut ♪

435
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:56,923
- It's working, Chum! Keep going!
- Got it!

436
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:58,883
♪ Gently place the
cars on the ground ♪

437
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:01,803
♪ Don't scare the
people and turn around ♪

438
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:07,809
♪ Run away with a
nice smooth motion ♪

439
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:10,520
♪ Make a bee-line for
the deep blue ocean ♪

440
00:21:10,562 --> 00:21:11,938
Instruction songs?

441
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,441
The funnest songs in
the whole fun-a-verse!

442
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:18,945
♪ Wade in slow so
you do not drown ♪

443
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:23,241
♪ Bend those knees
and sit on down ♪

444
00:21:23,658 --> 00:21:28,747
♪ Now dunk that head
with no concern ♪

445
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:34,461
♪ And swim away and
don't you return ♪

446
00:21:36,254 --> 00:21:39,257
You know, this old man guitar
music's starting to grow on me.

447
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:41,426
Chum!

448
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:44,262
- I think you should have these.
- Really?

449
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:46,222
You put our dumb
competition aside

450
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:47,849
to do some phenomenal assisting.

451
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:49,934
- And you saved the city.

452
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:52,771
Oh, Sir will be so
touched that you...

453
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,356
I didn't do it for him.

454
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:56,483
Us assistants have
to stick together.

455
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:01,613
Megamind: You did
a great job, Chum.

456
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:04,532
I'm quite proud. But remember.

457
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:07,702
One Chum has always
been enough for me.

458
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:10,413
Um, Sir?

459
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:12,582
: That's my
little fish monkey.

460
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:18,963
Operation Mega Meltdown
was only a partial success.

461
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:22,175
We've got the hairbrush,
but the binky's not here.

462
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:23,861
Machiavillain :
I would need a crayon

463
00:22:23,885 --> 00:22:25,553
to put this into simpler terms.

464
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:29,557
The binky is the key
to my entire plan.

465
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:34,020
It's so hard to
find quality assistants.

466
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:37,941
But, I guess if you want
something done right,

467
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:42,070
you have to get someone
else to do it yourself!

468
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:56,668
♪ Not to repeat myself ♪

469
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:02,632
♪ But free will is a lie ♪

470
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:08,096
♪ Free will is a lie... ♪

471
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:12,600
Huh!
