Roxanne: Yes, I am
aware of the damage,

12
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,842
and we're working on it.

13
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:54,220
Were you aware that we're
giving away a free coffee

14
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:56,389
to anyone inconvenienced
by a Megamind battle?

15
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:59,726
- Let me in, Christina!
- Oh, no, no, no!

16
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:02,604
We have a very strict
no nuisance policy!

17
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,023
According
to my nuisance detector,

18
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,067
you're actually the nuisance,

19
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,985
and your readings
are off the charts!

20
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,529
- You let me go!
- Congratulations, guys.

21
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:13,698
You're both
nuisances! Let him in.

22
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:15,075
I... Ah!

23
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,243
You did that on purpose.

24
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,120
She's crazy busy
dealing with the people

25
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,998
mad at the damage you caused
playing hero out there,

26
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:23,625
so make this quick.

27
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,251
Ah-chnoo-sance!

28
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:27,504
That was
not a real sneeze.

29
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:30,006
Roxie, I have some
tech that will help us

30
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:32,926
keep Metrocity safer than
a baby in bubble wrap.

31
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,220
I'm happy you're excited
about your invention,

32
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,680
but I'm slammed today.

33
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:39,086
I swear, I don't think I could
handle just one more thing.

34
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,493
- Lady
Doppler : Attention!

35
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:41,935
This is an evil weather alert!

36
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,312
Good morning, Metro City!

37
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:47,190
- Ooh! Lady Doppler...
- Shh!

38
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:49,442
I have a forecast for today.

39
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,861
Dark and stormy over
the mayor's office.

40
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:53,780
The map says sunshine.

41
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,365
She always was
terrible at weather.

42
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,575
And for Roxanne Ritchi,

43
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,411
the tattletale former reporter

44
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,621
who got me fired
all those years ago,

45
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:04,916
- 100% chance of revenge!

46
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,501
She's good.

47
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:09,337
Hey, just because I'm
a hero doesn't mean

48
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,881
I've lost my appreciation
for quality treachery.

49
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:15,802
She shot lightning at me!
And, yes, I did get her fired.

50
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,846
But now, I have to
arrange a bodyguard,

51
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,223
cancel public appearances,
probably build a bunker.

52
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:23,810
There, there. Relax your boo-tay
on that ergonomic chair, Roxie.

53
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:26,646
Stopping baddies is
my bag. Fear not!

54
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:29,024
It's easy for you
to say, "Fear not."

55
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,484
You're walking around all
safe with a pew-pew ray gun.

56
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:33,862
It's more of a
chick a-pow ray gun.

57
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,614
But, my wits protect this
city more than my weapon.

58
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,617
Which brings me to the
purpose of my visit.

59
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,703
- My new gadget.

60
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,499
Ow!

61
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,919
Huh? What the?

62
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:51,880
I look... like... you.

63
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,718
- Why do you look like me?
- Switcheroo microchips!

64
00:02:56,843 --> 00:03:00,388
The hottest new crime-stopping
tech from yours truly.

65
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:03,892
And sound like
me. I-I sound like you!

66
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,727
It's a twist on the
disguise generator.

67
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:09,189
Explain any scenario in
which this would be useful.

68
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,566
It's... great for a
good bamboozlement.

69
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,318
Can't you just turn it off?!

70
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,320
It's more of a wear-off thing.

71
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,155
How long does it last?

72
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,240
- A few days, tops.
- Days?!

73
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:22,494
I'm the mayor! I have people
waiting to see me now.

74
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,704
Don't be such a nervous Nadine.

75
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:27,165
How hard is it being
mayor of Metrocity?

76
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,168
First, it's
pronounced Metro City.

77
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:34,714
- Second, don't let the intercom scare you.

78
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,735
Christina : Madam Mayor, the
gentleman from the parking garage is here.

79
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,845
Great. He's already upset about
you blowing up his garage.

80
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,182
Why? The jaywalker's getaway
car was parked there.

81
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,726
So were a thousand other cars!

82
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:49,521
I won't apologize
for being thorough.

83
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:52,065
You will do exactly as I say.

84
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,483
This stays hush-hush.

85
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,026
If anyone finds out,

86
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,445
it'll seem like I'm not
in control of the city.

87
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,698
- And that's the last... Whoa. Whoa!

88
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:02,742
Oh...  Your
head is so big.

89
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:05,245
It's like balancing a
turkey on a toothpick!

90
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,047
You need to find me a
new place to park cars!

91
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:19,718
Just park them in the park.
It's right there in the name.

92
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:22,429
- I'm allowed to do that?
- I do it all the time.

93
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,180
It's not like there's
a law against it.

94
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,465
Roxie-As-Megamind: There's
absolutely a law against it!

95
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:28,810
He can't park cars
in the public park!

96
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:29,686
Is this thing on?

97
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,980
- Yes, it's on.
- Huh?

98
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,983
The things I say under
my breath are not for you.

99
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,068
Roxie-As-Megamind: Your
request is not possible.

100
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,945
Your request is not possible.

101
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,631
Roxie-As-Megamind: Thank
you for stopping by.

102
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,407
Thank you for stopping by.

103
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,552
Really? That's it? Can I
give him a muffin or something?

104
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:47,078
- I'd like a muffin.
- No muffin.

105
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:50,165
I withdraw my offer of muffins.

106
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,961
Figures. I had a feeling
you'd do nothing for me.

107
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,337
If I remember to vote,
It won't be for you.

108
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,235
Let me tell you something I
learned in the few seconds

109
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,511
I've been mayor. People
like to hear "yes."

110
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,805
It's all that "no" stuff
that makes you unpopular.

111
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,610
No wonder you're stressed
out all the time.

112
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,934
This should be an easy job.

113
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,645
The job would be a lot
easier without all of your

114
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,606
swing-by-the-seat-of-your-pants
antics.

115
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,067
Now, you're attacking
pants antics,

116
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:18,443
the one sport I'm good at!

117
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,819
Give me this pew-pew ray gun,

118
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:21,738
and I'd do 10 times
the saving you do

119
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,281
with half the damage!

120
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,409
Ha! Maybe a 13%
reduction. At most.

121
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,922
O-Okay... Uh,

122
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,367
there are more angry people
here who wanna complain to you.

123
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:42,759
- Let them in.
- Get rid of them.

124
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,303
The mayor isn't
really feeling well,

125
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,514
and we thought maybe
she should rest.

126
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,641
I've made a remarkable recovery!

127
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,018
Christina, send in
the complainers!

128
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:54,396
Don't you have to
present Keiko Morita

129
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,314
with the Citizen Heroism Award?

130
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,941
I don't see that here.

131
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,860
That's because the defender
of the city gives that medal.

132
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,987
You must be getting
our schedules confused

133
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:05,907
- for no real reason at all.
- You heard the mayor!

134
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,792
- Playtime is over! Move it!

135
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,620
- But... But...
- Let's go, let's go! Brilliant retort, as always.

136
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,497
- Do nothing. Say nothing.

137
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:17,002
Ugh, and let her wallow in
the hatred of her citizenry?

138
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:20,046
No. I will make Roxanne Ritchie

139
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:24,467
the most popular mayor
in Metrocity history!

140
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,791
Are you speaking
in third person?

141
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,766
Maybe. Megamind does it,

142
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,352
and he's way cooler than you.

143
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:40,793
- Roxie-As-Megamind: Metro... AH.

144
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,902
Metrocity is fortunate enough

145
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:45,196
to have someone
as brave as Keiko

146
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,489
among its citizens.

147
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,992
Or ci-tie-zens.

148
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:53,163
And let's not forget the
importance of a good mayor

149
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:55,915
'cause you've got one. She
can be overlooked, you know.

150
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:59,419
She's really doing
everything she can

151
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,671
about all the
damage. Or de-mage.

152
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,675
Anyway, for her bravery

153
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,761
in helping stop
the Doom Syndicate,

154
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:11,139
I present Keiko Morita
with this award.

155
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,516
- Let's hear it for her, Metrocity!

156
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,103
Roxanne?

157
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,522
No. I'm Megamind.

158
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,358
Keiko: I appreciate
you taking time

159
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:23,860
from throwing darts
at the mayor's picture

160
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,070
to give me this award.

161
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:26,529
He does that?!

162
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:29,366
Aha! You are Roxanne!

163
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:31,076
Okay, okay.

164
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:33,536
He tried some
switcheroo tech on me,

165
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:34,913
and it's not wearing off.

166
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,956
And how is that a bad thing?

167
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,167
Oh, I'd love to be
Megamind for a day.

168
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,504
Chasing bad guys, zapping
stuff with the pa-pow ray gun.

169
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,632
Oh, you know what? We should
totally stop some crimes!

170
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:48,468
No! I need to get
back to my office.

171
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,178
He's at my desk,
looking like me,

172
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,514
and I have to make sure he
doesn't do any mayor stuff!

173
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,182
You could do that,

174
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,726
or you could not be
a totally lame person

175
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,520
and stop some crimes!

176
00:07:58,645 --> 00:07:59,854
- Yeah, but...
- Hear me out.

177
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,565
This could also help
Megamind's web channel.

178
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:05,485
I need some content where
he's a little more personable,

179
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,028
and that comes naturally to you.

180
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,864
Thanks, I get it, but we
shouldn't press our luck.

181
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,242
- Also, his pants are really tight.

182
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:15,328
I've got a
super-wedgie going on.

183
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:16,746
So sorry I'm late, Sir.

184
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:20,208
I was trying to butter toast
with some very cold butter.

185
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,460
- Oh, it's fine.
- No, it's not!

186
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:23,878
I'm a terrible sidekick.

187
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:30,468
Oh. Um, you know, I
don't say this enough,

188
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,721
but I appreciate you.

189
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,431
Sir? Are you okay?

190
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,450
- Maybe we should check your temperature.

191
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,869
Officer : Attention, all
units. Purse snatching in progress.

192
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,020
Shall we pursue, Sir?

193
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:41,896
Oh, I don't think
that's a very good...

194
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,862
Dude! You gotta spend
time in Megamind's shoes,

195
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,316
- see how it feels.
- Uh,

196
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:48,653
pretty sure he does
that every day, Keiko.

197
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,488
I guess this could be a chance

198
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,615
to prove that it is
possible to save the day

199
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:55,660
without causing so much
pain-in-the-mayoral-rear damage.

200
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,455
- Plus, I get
to fire the pew-pew ray gun.

201
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,666
I thought we agreed it was
more of a chick a-pow ray gun.

202
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,296
Oh, uh, sorry, Sir. I
know you hate this song.

203
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:07,756
I don't, actually.

204
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,215
Just yesterday,

205
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:11,319
you said it was the national
anthem of throwing up.

206
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:14,262
Well, I've changed
my mind. It's catchy.

207
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,140
Makes me wanna dance
in my too-tight pants.

208
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:20,477
- Turn it up.
- Okay, then!

209
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:24,272
- Can I get
a "waka waka woo" up in here?!

210
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,397
♪ Waka waka woo ♪

211
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,569
- Mayor's office.

212
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:33,031
You want to place a giant snow
globe in the art district?

213
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:35,408
In the middle of the street?
In the middle of summer?!

214
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,328
- I can't think of a single reason why not! Yes!

215
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,014
- You've got the mayor.

216
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,432
Parking enforcement
is overwhelmed?

217
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:44,209
- Well, I say yes to giving them the day off!

218
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,586
Dog lovers wanna hold a
rally in the city square?

219
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,296
- That's a big yes!

220
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,091
Cat lovers wanna hold a
rally in the city square?

221
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:54,260
The more the merrier!
Y-E-S spells yes!

222
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:56,680
Whee!

223
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,812
I need to
hit the gym more!

224
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,484
Please stop! I have
a rock in my boot!

225
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,784
Uh-oh. Getting the pukies.

226
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,870
I'm never
gonna catch this guy.

227
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,580
Time for old pew-pew!

228
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:26,292
- Wh-Whoa! Whoa! Ah!

229
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:28,670
Huh?

230
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,550
- Chum.

231
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:35,927
What do you think is the best
setting on this right now?

232
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,763
You're asking my opinion, Sir?

233
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:41,850
He turned down the next block!

234
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,185
Chum, cut him off! I
need a good ending.

235
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,524
- Roxie-As-Megamind: Ha, ha!
- Huh?

236
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,359
- Got you!

237
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,157
- Oh...

238
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:00,869
See ya!

239
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,583
Woo! What a rush!

240
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:10,670
And I have to say, I don't
think we did that much damage.

241
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,679
- Ooh, we did much damage.

242
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,182
Now, give us a pose and a line.

243
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:23,683
Um...

244
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,603
Remember, I did
not do this alone.

245
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:29,773
It took all three of us to
stop this purse snatcher.

246
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,735
He was very fast.

247
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:35,820
A Megamind who takes direction.

248
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,739
This is a dream!

249
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:46,247
Hey-hey!

250
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:48,768
You know what is going
to send Roxanne's...

251
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:51,670
Uh, I mean my approval
ratings through the roof?

252
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:53,755

is going to be electrifying!

274
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,193
Oh, Megamind.

275
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:00,030
Have you always been this
strong, smart, and appealing?

276
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:02,323
Thank you for
sending my popularity

277
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,534
- into the stratosphere!

278
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,459
Anchor : Megamind
has been at it again.

279
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,514
- Citizens are fed up. The meal?

280
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,248
Megamind's excessive
destruction.

281
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:12,500
He turned me into
a bullion cube.

282
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,211
My doctor says I'm not
supposed to be a bullion cube.

283
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:17,672
What in the name
of Darwin's donut?

284
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,258
- She's ruining my rep! Roxie!

285
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:21,843
- Come in.
- I'm here.

286
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,946
We're just stuck in some
sort of traffic nightmare.

287
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:28,016
What exactly have you
been doing out there?

288
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,143
It's taken a lot of work
to make you popular,

289
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:32,687
and you're destroying
the city in my name?

290
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,356
I am not... Wait.

291
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:35,982
What do you mean,
make me popular?

292
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:37,275
Have you been mayoring?

293
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,319
Funny story.

294
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:42,030
I might have made
some appearances.

295
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:45,158
- Appearances? As in more than one appearance?

296
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:48,078
And maybe changed
some parking laws.

297
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:55,710
Ah!

298
00:13:57,003 --> 00:14:01,091
Did you approve of that gaudy
art snow globe I kept rejecting?

299
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:03,593
Apparently, people
love giant things

300
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:05,387
where they're not
supposed to be.

301
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:08,139
- I don't get it either.

302
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,183
- Hey, move it!
- Get outta the road!

303
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:11,518
I gotta get to work here!

304
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:14,062
There's a war brewing
outside, ma'am!

305
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:20,151
You said dog rally,
not cat rally.

306
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,820
Dogs aren't smart
enough to rally!

307
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:23,738
This is preposterous.

308
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:27,450
Why can't you all get
along? Like cats and dogs!

309
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:30,954
We should get you
back inside, ma'am.

310
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,288
I'm reaping what I've sown.

311
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:34,416
Things are coming back
to bite me in the butt.

312
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:38,169
- I've created a monster. And other clichés!

313
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,797
- Roxie-As-Megamind: What's happening?
- So, listen. Sure,

314
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:44,634
I did some mayoring wrong, and
now they all hate me or you.

315
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,886
W-We're gonna
have to fix this.

316
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:49,639
The people need to hear from
their calm, collected mayor.

317
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:52,642
Megamind-As-Roxie: I don't
know how to quell the masses.

318
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:55,186
Remember, they're
looking for leadership.

319
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,689
First, get a podium
in front of you.

320
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:05,155
Now, give a speech
that's stern but fair.

321
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,449
Citizens of Metrocity.

322
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:11,161
Start acting civilized
or feel my wrath!

323
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:13,246
- No!

324
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:14,789
Do not threaten the citizens.

325
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:23,757
Oh, good. Lady Doppler
just showed up.

326
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:25,383
Didn't you say you'd handle her?

327
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:28,219
Sorry. I got distracted by
the whole becoming you thing.

328
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:30,180
Good news is she's after me now,

329
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:31,973
so you're it.

330
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:33,808
Fine. You calm the mob.

331
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,685
I think I've spent
enough time in your shoes

332
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,270
to keep this weather
witch at bay.

333
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,158
Roxie,
they're staring at me

334
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,369
with their ordinary
eyes. What do I say?

335
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:56,331
Megamind! Your girlfriend
shoulda worn a raincoat

336
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,917
'cause a blizzard's
coming to City Hall!

337
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:00,585
A raincoat for snow?

338
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,712
Do you even know
what weather is?

339
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:04,839
A raincoat for snow?

340
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,841
Do you even know
what weather is?

341
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,386
That was for
Doppler, not you.

342
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:11,888
Hey, Doppler, here's
a forecast for you.

343
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:15,141
A butt-kicking front coming in
with a 100% chance of defeat!

344
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,394
You're getting some
great lines in on Doppler,

345
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,271
but I need great lines, too.

346
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:22,982
- Feel my thunder!
- Ah!

347
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,568
- Oh!

348
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,947
- Hello? Hello?!

349
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:30,865
Not ideal.

350
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,910
You do realize that was
lightning, not thunder, right?

351
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:36,037
Catch me if you can.

352
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,334
We can't let her
get to Megamind!

353
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:43,545
She's already gotten
past you, Sir.

354
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,339
- Way past, in fact.
- Uh, I meant Roxanne.

355
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:49,134
- Let's go!

356
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,428
- Hello? Hello?

357
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:53,346
I gotta say something.

358
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:57,267
Citizens of Metro... Ci... ty.

359
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:01,104
I think you're all wonderful.

360
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:02,981
And marvelous! And

361
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:05,525
really cool and stuff.

362
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,611
- The end. And mic drop?

363
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,748
Not one more step.

364
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:21,499
I got you, Gail.

365
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Really?

366
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:30,008
Womp, womp. Oh, what
happened to you?

367
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:32,302
You used to be better than this.

368
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:34,054
- Pathetic!

369
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:38,224
- Christina: Okay, okay!

370
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,642
Everyone, just calm down!

371
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:41,227
- Ma'am,

372
00:17:41,353 --> 00:17:44,439
I advise you to open your
mouth and let words come out.

373
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:46,358
What would Roxanne do?

374
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:49,027
She wouldn't vaporize
anyone, so that's out.

375
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:50,862
She would also say "no" a lot.

376
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:57,035
Ollo... Hello. How's it going?

377
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,120
- Okay, okay.

378
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:02,290
You're mad because I used
to say "no" too much,

379
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,000
and now, I've said
"yes" too much.

380
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:07,253
What I've learned is there's
a time for each of those,

381
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:09,631
and now is a "no" time.

382
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,591
Like no division.

383
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:14,969
We can all work together
to make things easier.

384
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:17,681
- Eh, I don't know about that.
- She's not wrong.

385
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:20,809
What about no
fighting? That's good!

386
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:24,187
If you're a dog lover, don't
fight with the cat lovers.

387
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:25,772
They're just like you,

388
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:28,000
only they prefer to love an
animal that actively hates them

389
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:31,111
and goes to the bathroom
in a box in their home.

390
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:33,530
The point is,
we're all the same.

391
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:36,950
We're all weird, but,
you know, a-a good weird.

392
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:41,079
And if we can all imagine
walking in each other's shoes,

393
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:42,622
maybe we can learn to appreciate

394
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:44,791
and respect each
other's weirdness.

395
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:48,503
Then, none of us are
weird! We're just us.

396
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:51,423
- Metrocity!

397
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:03,101
We interrupt this boring
speech for a weather alert.

398
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:05,729
An earthquake's a-comin'!

399
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:08,231
An earthquake isn't weather.

400
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,776
- Why is everybody on my case today?

401
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,590
Roxie is in
danger. Let's go!

402
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,616
You go. I'm sure it'll be easier

403
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:20,410
to defeat Lady
Doppler without me.

404
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:22,370
That doesn't sound
like you, Sir.

405
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:25,206
Yeah, we're gonna need
confident Megamind back.

406
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:28,835
But my pew-pew ray gun is
busted.

407
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,255
Pardon my language,
but gun shmun.

408
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:36,217
It's your wits that
protect the city, Sir,

409
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:37,594
not your weapon.

410
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:39,429
Well, as Keiko knows,

411
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:41,848
I'm not quite feeling
like myself today.

412
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:45,727
But even if you're feeling
like, oh, say Roxanne today,

413
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:48,938
you know that Roxanne is
at least as smart as you.

414
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:50,065
Huh.

415
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,441
You're right.

416
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:53,902
I am as smart as Roxanne.

417
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:57,197
Not sure I understand, but
I agree with the message!

418
00:19:57,322 --> 00:19:59,783
You're the master of
plans and schemes.

419
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:01,701
I'm certain you can
come up with a way

420
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:04,329
to contain Lady
Doppler's weather attack.

421
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:06,956
Contain the
weather... That's it!

422
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:09,459
The mayor may have
been terrible today,

423
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:12,796
but she gave us just the tool
we need to defeat Doppler!

424
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:16,299
Plans and schemes!
That's my Sir!

425
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:23,473
You're about to
lose in a landslide!

426
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:28,019
That's clearly a tornado.

427
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:30,897
And again, landslide?
Not weather!

428
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:32,816
I'm exhausted
correcting this woman.

429
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:36,277
Aw, unfortunately, there's no
time for an official recall.

430
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:39,406
Let's just skip to the
part where you're ousted!

431
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:44,160
Looks like the sky
is clearing up.

432
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:45,704
Didn't I already defeat you?

433
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:48,790
You destroyed my
gun, not my mind.

434
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:52,627
Nothing a change in
weather pattern can't fix.

435
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,963
Ah!

436
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:58,216
Chum! Snow globe!

437
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:04,139
Yes!

438
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:09,060
I think I'm gonna
be sick!

439
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:12,355
Doppler out.

440
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,190
That's a wrap, everybody!

441
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,237
Outstanding work.

442
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:21,740
Specifically the saving me part.

443
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:23,575
I even had a cool line!

444
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,786
Looks like the sky
is clearing up!

445
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:30,665
Crowd: Megamind!
Megamind! Megamind!

446
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,001
It sounds so beautiful.

447
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:34,627
Like angels.

448
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:36,671
You calmed them down
all on your own.

449
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,048
That's great.

450
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:40,633
They were chanting your
name earlier, I swear.

451
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:43,553
Looks like Metrocity
loves us both once again.

452
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:45,972
Bring it in, team.

453
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:49,059
I love this new
in-touch-with-your-feelings Sir.

454
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:52,645
Let's not get too used to it.
Maybe just special occasions.

455
00:22:08,703 --> 00:22:09,871
Roxie: Thank you!

456
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:14,334
Now, I hate to be
a "mayor downer..."

457
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:17,170
Get it? Like major...
Never mind.

458
00:22:17,295 --> 00:22:20,882
Parking rules are back in effect
and fines will be doubled.

459
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:22,568
- I gotta move my car!
- I can't afford a ticket!

460
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:26,971
Thanks for the opportunity, Sir.

461
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:29,849
