I'll have you know I've
been taking online classes,

299

So, do you want my help?

301
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,339
I don't need help
from you or anyone!

302
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,342
Believe me, self-teaching
is the best.

303
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,803
If you teach me, the
only way I can be sure

304
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,889
I've mastered cake-making is
if I defeat you in battle,

305
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:46,850
and I really don't
want to do that to you.

306
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,351
I-I think your last teacher

307
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,770
may have given you the
wrong idea about teaching.

- Oh, so many wrong ideas.

Oh, silly me. (Laughs)
You must be so lost.

314
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:10,415
I'm Machiavillain, an
old friend of Megamind's.

315
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,210
It is a pleasure to finally
make your acquaintance, Keiko.

316
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:17,172
It's very clear to me that
you're a gifted student

317
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,257
in desperate need of
the right teacher.

318
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,092
Actually, Megamind promised...

319
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,886
Machiavillain:
Megamind. (Scoffs)

320
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,322
He could've been
the greatest villain

321
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:25,972
the world has ever seen.

322
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:28,975
He had so much potential.

323
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,061
(sighs) It must be heartbreaking

324
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:32,896
he doesn't see yours.

325
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:35,440
That's... actually why I'm here.

326
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,275
Figured I'd give evil a shot.

327
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,320
And you'd be a much better
teacher than Megamind.

328
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:42,072
How do we know she's not
just trying to spy on us

329
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:44,699
- for her old boss?
- Machiavillain: Hm...

330
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,327
She's right. You'll have
to prove your loyalty

331
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,537
before we can start
your training.

332
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,164
Yeah, sure. Okay.

333
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:54,084
What do you want me to do?
Rob a bank? Destroy the moon?

334
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:56,252
- (dramatic music playing)
- I want you to steal.

335
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:59,714
Megamind's baby binky.

336
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,758
That's it. Seriously?

337
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:03,361
Machiavillain: Think
of it as a small test

338
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:06,763
before we let you in
on our bigger plans.

339
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:08,264
But know this.

340
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,766
You try anything funny,

341
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:12,352
and you will force
me to do something

342
