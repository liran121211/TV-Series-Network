And thanks for the isotopes.

You mean these isotopes?

Come on, Megamind. You got this.

36
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,217
Okay, I don't got this!

37
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:35,011
Nighty-Knight: Around
and around you go!

38
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,097

Ah! My eyes!

(yelling, grunts)

41
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:41,935
Ah!

42
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,436
Don't fall asleep on the job!

43
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,563
Megamind: Know this.

44
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:49,359
I will not rest until
I get those isotopes!

45
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:53,613
But first, maybe
a quick power nap.

46
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:54,614
(snores)

47
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,950
As per your ordinance,

48
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:59,285
we have slept (clears throat)

49
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,496
swept this city clean.

50
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:04,332
- And the isotopes?
- That I lost,

51
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,459
mostly because we were sweeping,

52
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,754
but I will not rest until
I've recovered them,

53
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,673
- Roberta.
- Roxie.

54
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:14,801
I'm Megamind. You're
Roxie, Roberta.

55
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:18,763
- Uh, is his brain broken?
- How would we tell?

56
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,140
(snoring, grunts)

57
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:22,642
You've been chasing
villains all night.

58
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:23,935
You should go to bed.

59
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,812
Hopefully a right-side-up one.

60
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,397
Heroes don't rest.

61
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,483
Now, I really have to
get back to the lair.

62
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:33,153
Keiko: Um, this is
your lair, buddy.

63
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:36,656
Ah, yes, of course.
Thank you, Chum.

64
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,467
(snoring) - If Megamind
doesn't get some rest,

65
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:41,661
he's gonna have a
complete Mega-meltdown.

66
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,831
And those are never
pretty. But not to worry.

67
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:47,584
I'll have him shipshape
on the good ship Shipshape

68
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:51,004
- in no time. (Laughs)
- I know you will, Chum.

69
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,506
- (groans)
- He really needs some rest.

70
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,759
Ma'am, you have a full day
of wall-to-wall meetings.

71
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,011
Keiko, Chum, this has been
a confusing waste of time,

72
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,346
per usual.

73
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,015
Well, you and I should
be able to handle things

74
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:04,184
while Megamind rests
and recuperates.

75
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,353
I've got his beloved
binky right here.

76
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,438
First of all, he uses a binky?

77
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,856
Like a little baby?

78
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,441
Don't tell him I told you.

79
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:13,109
But, yes, it does
help him relax.

80
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:16,279
That's a fun fact our followers
don't need to know about.

81
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,697
Anyway, it's a school day, bro.

82
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,366
I'm only here for
the toaster pastries.

83
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,826
Oh, but he's in pretty
bad shape, Keiko.

84
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,204
I don't know if I can
take care of him alone.

85
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:25,330
(groans, snores)

86
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,040
I'll come back right
when school is out

87
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:28,625
and give you a
hand. But, come on.

88
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,377
You're Chum. You've got this.

singer of Facemelter,

91
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,133
is doing a show in town!

92
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,219
Sir's gonna want
tickets for sure.

- Chum,

100
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,277
I cannot let myself
be distracted

101
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,364
by the smooth sounds and
velvety voice of Izzy Iggy!

102
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,032
There's work to do!

103
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,743
(snores) - Sir, you
should be in bed relaxing.

104
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,453
Here, take your binky.

105
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,623
Oh, I don't need to relax,
and I don't need my binky.

106
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,917
What I need is to
create a simulation

107
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,378
of every possible move the
Doom Syndicate could make!

108
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,673
This will keep me a good
six to seven steps ahead.

109
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:20,051
- Okay...
- But not only that, I need to create a simulation

110
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,679
of every possible move the
Doom Syndicate could make.

111
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:26,224
This will keep me a good
six to seven steps ahead.

112
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,851
Ooh! A butterfly!

113
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:30,770
How did you even get in here,
you silly little bug fairy, you?

114
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,940
(sighs) He may not know
it, but this Izzy Iggy show

115
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,776
is exactly what Sir needs
to recharge his batteries.

116
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:40,905
"Remaining Izzy tickets only
available at the box office."

117
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,532
Huh...

118
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,367
He'd probably be fine by himself

119
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,369
if I stepped out
for just a second.

120
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,496
(wheezing laugh)

121
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:51,166
Although I don't agree
with your politics,

122
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,126
that is too funny, Butterfly.

123
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:54,669
Or maybe not.

124
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,672
How can I get those
tickets and care for Sir?

125
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,925
Oh, I could really use an
assistant of my own today.

126
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,220
Huh...

127
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,638
Alright, cloning machine.

128
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,432
Let's make another
me to watch Sir

129
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,601
- while I grab those tickets!

00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:18,193
Sir could use a little
more attention than usual,

134
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:21,154
so I'll adjust the
new me just a skosh.

135
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:22,697
I'm already smart enough,

136

intelligence for persistence.

Okay then. Try to
get him to rest

148
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:56,356
while I'm off on my
errand to help him,

149
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:57,816
you know, rest.

150
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:58,858
Oh!

151
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,528
Uh, in case it rains
on your journey.

Oh, I should be back in a jiff.

154
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,744
Ah-ah! No one's ever been
sorry they brought a lunch.

155
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,579
I never thought of it that way.

156
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,833
Or actually, I suppose I did.

157
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,251

I can't say why,

159
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,588
but what I'm seeing makes me
believe the Doom Syndicate

160
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,009
is building a giant
radioactive banana.

161
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,969
Diabolical! Hey!

162
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,554
What the?!

163
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:30,098
No rest is for the wicked, Sir.

164
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,350
And you are not wicked. Anymore.

165
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,352
- Here we go. And...

166

What are you... It
doesn't recline!

00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:05,970
And since we're
positive I'm dreaming,

352
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,722
I can do whatever I want!

353
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,432
Whee!

354
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:12,060
I never felt so free!

355
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:13,895
- (whooping)
- Lemme make a wild guess here.

356
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:15,814
Chum made a clone
because he needed help,

357
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,565
and that clone made more clones.

358
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,693
And now, Megamind has
no concept of reality

359
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:22,862
because he's having a
complete Mega-meltdown!

360
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:24,447
No!

361
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,574
Well, actually, yes.

362
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:27,784
(alarm blaring)

363
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:29,411
(news music playing)

364
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:31,663
Anchor (on TV): Things are
growing dangerous downtown

365
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:35,041
- as a now 40-foot Behemoth rampages through Metr...
- (static)

366
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,961
Oh, this dream is
only getting better!

367
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:40,088
I get to battle a
40-foot Behemoth

368
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,924
with my unlimited dream powers!

369
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:44,551
To the Invisible Car!

370
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:48,596
- Chums: Coming, Sir!
- You four stay here.

371
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,974
I'm gonna be his dream sherpa
and make sure he stays safe

372
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:52,284
and doesn't try anything stupid.

373
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,476
I'm gonna destroy Behemoth

374
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:55,729
with electric beams
from my eyeballs!

375
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,355
Dream power!

376
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:01,484
- You will never stop us from assisting our Sir!
- (yelps)

377
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,860
(grunts)

378
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:04,779
- (Chums yell)
- (crashing)

379
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:07,532
- (rumbling)
- (straining)

380
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,075
- (grunts)
- (clang)

381
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,368
That'll do.

382
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,163
Ah! Tell me you're normal Chum!

383
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:16,624
I just wanted to say
tweedle-dee dinglee-deedledee!

384
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,711
Because it's so fun to say
when you're happy like me!

385
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,296
(laughing) Yeah!

386
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:23,673
Oh, definitely not normal Chum.

387
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:25,550
Listen up. This is my dream,

388
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,344
and I want to make
fighting Behemoth

389
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,387
be as fun as a dream
can make possible!

390
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,682
I know what's fun! We'll get
the new improved Invisible Car

391
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:34,225
and sneak up on Behemoth!

392
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,061
It'll be like a surprise party!

393
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,479
I don't think that's a...

394
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,939
Wait, that's actually
not a bad idea.

395
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:42,567
- And... voilàà!
- (car whirring)

396
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,611
(electric guitar riff)

397
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,529
This is perfect!

398
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,281
This is a disaster.

399
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:53,536
Okay, real talk.

400
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,138
You're heading to
battle with Behemoth,

401
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:57,791
and you do not have
magic dream powers!

402
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:01,419
Oh, you're way more fun
in real life, Keiko.

403
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,463
I'm flying in my dream!

404
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:05,965
- Whee!
- (engine roars)

405
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:09,052
- Oh no!
- (Behemoth roars)

406
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:11,471
- Make the car invisible.
- Aw, but I wanna see

407
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:14,307
if we can make Behemoth
smile at its pretty colors!

408
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:18,144
We can stop it with the
dream power of happiness!

409
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:19,688
- No!
- Yes, we can.

410
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,856
(honking)

411
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:24,150
- (roars) Ooh.
- (smash)

412
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:26,486
Pretty car.

413
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:29,906
(stomping) -Aw, it
worked! We made him smile.

414
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:33,827
Behemoth smash pretty car!

415
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:35,203
- (roars)
- (screaming)

416
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:39,082
Megamind: I never felt
nauseous in a dream before!

417
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:42,293
- (laughs)
- It's not a dream!

418
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:45,005
Don't worry, bummer dream Keiko.

419
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:48,174
My electro-vision
will blast Behemoth!

420
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:50,176
(aggressive humming)

421
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:52,345
Oh, please end well.
Please end well.

422
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:54,115
(banging) - Chum clone:
Sir! Let us help you!

423
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:55,432
I will rescue you!

424
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:59,519
Strike me down! Sir is
out there in danger!

425
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:03,273
And he doesn't even
have his binky!

426
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,984
(gasps) The perfect
plan to help Sir.

427
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:10,113
I know it will come to us if
we just put our heads together!

428
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:12,615
Put our heads
together... (gasps)

429
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:14,576
What if we use the
cloning machine

430
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:17,704
to combine our molecules,
lower all our attributes,

431
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:21,374
and maximize strength,
making one gigantic us!

432
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:25,420
- (clang)
- (whirring, zapping)

433
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,549
- (smash)
- (stomping)

434
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:32,260
I'm coming, Sir!

435
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:35,305
(dramatic crescendo)

436
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:37,599
(muffled stomping)

437
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,769
- Hi, Roxanne!
- Hi, Chum.

438
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,938
- Take that! And that! (Grunting)
- (Behemoth laughs)

439
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,066
- Who tickle Behemoth?
- (clang)

440
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:48,443
Megamind? (Growls)

441
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:49,402
Huh?

442
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:51,279
I'll save you, Sir!

443
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:53,073
(gasps, panting)

444
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:54,699
- Whoa!
- (air whistling)

445
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:57,494
- (stomp)
- A great big Chum! Keiko!

446
00:17:57,535 --> 00:18:00,288
Isn't this the most
wonderful dream?!

447
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,749
You know what? I'm gonna
give in to the crazy.

448
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:05,460
- This kicks butt!
- You just relax, Sir.

449
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:07,796
I'll handle this.

450
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:10,840

Everything's giant
monsters these days.

00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:29,192
Shh! Sir is trying to nap!

457
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:30,944
(both yell)

458
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:32,404

(muffled struggling)

460
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:37,575
Ha! He did it! Megamind did it!

461
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:42,455
Megamind: Yes. Thank
you. You're all welcome.

462
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:44,374
He destroyed the streets again!

463
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,084
I can't get to work!

464
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:48,086
Even in my dream,

465
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:49,671
when I win, I lose.

466
00:18:49,713 --> 00:18:52,132
This city will be
the death of me.

467
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:53,633
(sucking)

468
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:56,428
This city will be
the death of him?

469
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,805
I have to act fast. I must

470
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:03,143
(smash) destroy the city
before it destroys Sir!

471
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:05,353

- Huh?
- (dramatic crescendo)

475
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:14,946
Hm.

476
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,157
I'd be happy to help
anyone with anything!

477
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:18,616
I'll do twice her anything

478
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,678
- and be three times as happy about it!
- (grunting)

479
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:23,997

final number is...

481
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:28,293
- 14.

482
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:30,587
I'm the best
assistant in the city!

483
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:33,048
Ha, ha! Yes! Told
you! In your face!

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,223
I think Megamind might need
some top-notch assisting

488
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:44,476
right about now. You
take the tickets.

489
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:47,562
If I'm gonna lose, at least
it's to another assistant

490
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:49,189
and a really good one.

491

like my plan went a little haywire.

493
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:59,491
He's finally resting, so
you kind of did your job.

- Sir...

495
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:04,579
- It's time to wake up, Sir.
- Oh, Chum.

496
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:07,540
- (relaxing music playing)
- I had the craziest dream ever.

497
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:10,335
There were so many yous,
but not in a good way.

Actually, it was real,
Sir. It all happened.

We're too late!

501
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:19,803
Until the city is flattened,

502
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:23,306
I don't think this MegaChum will
follow a single instruction!

503
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:25,058
That's a great idea, Sir!

504
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,269
There's one kind of
instruction no Chum can resist!

505
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:30,563

- MegaChum: Sorry!

506
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:33,066
Apologies, everyone.
Nothing personal.

507

00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:18,945
♪ Wade in slow so
you do not drown ♪

523
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:23,241
♪ Bend those knees
and sit on down ♪

524
00:21:23,658 --> 00:21:28,747
♪ Now dunk that head
with no concern ♪

525
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:34,461
♪ And swim away and
don't you return ♪

526
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:36,212
(song ends)

527
00:21:36,254 --> 00:21:39,257
You know, this old man guitar
music's starting to grow on me.

528
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:41,426
Chum! (Panting)

529
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:44,262
- I think you should have these.
- Really?

530
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:46,222
You put our dumb
competition aside

531
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:47,849
to do some phenomenal assisting.

532
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:49,934
- And you saved the city.
- (snoring)

533
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:52,771
Oh, Sir will be so
touched that you...

534
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,356
I didn't do it for him.

535
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:56,483
Us assistants have
to stick together.

536
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:58,026
(heartfelt music playing)

537
00:21:58,068 --> 00:21:59,986
(clink)

538
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:01,613
Megamind: You did
a great job, Chum.

539
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:04,532
I'm quite proud. But remember.

540
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:07,702
One Chum has always
been enough for me.

541
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:10,413
Um, Sir?

542
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:12,582
(groggy): That's my
little fish monkey.

543
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:14,501
(kiss, laugh)

544
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:18,963
Operation Mega Meltdown
was only a partial success.

545
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:22,175
We've got the hairbrush,
but the binky's not here.

546
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:23,861
Machiavillain (on phone):
(sighs) I would need a crayon

547
00:22:23,885 --> 00:22:25,553
to put this into simpler terms.

548
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:29,557
The binky is the key
to my entire plan.

549
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:34,020
(sighs) It's so hard to
find quality assistants.

550
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:37,941
But, I guess if you want
something done right,

551
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:42,070
you have to get someone
else to do it yourself!

552
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:43,947
(maniacal laugh)

553
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:49,536

555
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:56,668

00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:02,632

558
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:12,600
Huh!
