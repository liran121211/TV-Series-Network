Megamind's Guide to
Defending Your City!

13
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:59,351
I'm Keiko Morita in the
Casita del Megamind.

14
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,561
Today, the blue guy
himself is gonna give us

15
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:04,522
an insider peek of
his heroic lair.

16
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,067
Yes! Welcome! Today,

17
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:10,362
- we'll be live screaming from inside my...
- Keiko: Psst!

18
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,405
It's live "streaming."

19
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:16,368
Today, I'll
be live streaming

20
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,037
from inside my
super-secret abode.

21
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:21,247
So much cool stuff.
Check it out!

22
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:23,166
This first gizmo is
a particle collider

23
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,293
that can atomize anything.

24
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,420
But it also doubles
as a gelato maker.

25
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:30,131
Over here, we have
a time destabilizer.

26
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,509
That's extremely dangerous,

27
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:35,679
- so it's more of a conversoshon piece.

28
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,264
And over, here we have a
horrifying garbage monster

29
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,850
that I quite honestly
don't remember creating.

30
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,394
- Whoa!

31
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:46,356
Oh, hang on! That's just
my heroic assistant, Chum!

32
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:49,859
Smile for the camera, Chumberto!

33
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:53,530
- Hello.
- Chum keeps everything running in tip-top shape,

34
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:56,950
which is important because
safety is priority number one.

35
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,410
- Ah! Whoa!
- Look out!

36
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,910
Phew!

37
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,788
Grab me some bait and a hook

38
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:05,792
because those unstable
isotopes almost went fission!

39
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:09,004
Anyway, don't forget
to like and prescribe.

40
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,422
Keiko: And cut!

41
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,507
Great. Wrap that in a tortilla

42
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:15,051
'cause fans are gonna eat it up!

43
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,596
Oh...

44
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:23,018
May I have a word, sir?

45
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,062
Make it quick, Chum. Keiko
and I are onternetting.

46
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:27,480
About that, sir.

47
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,482
Ever since Keiko
started working here,

48
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:31,609
there has been an
overabundance of...

49
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:33,486
New subscribers
to my web channel?

50
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:36,448
- No.
- Unflinching respect and admiration?

51
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,116
- No.
- Pop culture references

52
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,493
we both just pretend
to understand?

53
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:43,204
Trash, sir. I was
going to say trash.

54
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,915
It's because I have no idea
where the trash can is.

55
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,251
Figured you guys just
played it loose here.

56
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,170
Trash starts with a T,

57
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,255
so it's located
in the south wing

58
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,590
next to the gumball machine,

59
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,842
a "treat," which
also starts with T.

60
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:58,386
I mean, how hard is
that to understand?

61
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,311
Why can't we just keep
a trash bin right here,

62
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,349
where we spend the
majority of our time?

63
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:04,684
Because we have never
done it that way.

64
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,269
I get that I'm the
newb on the team,

65
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,521
but your system makes,
like, zero sense.

66
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,523
I don't even have a
place to put my stuff!

67
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,609
Well, if I'm being
perfectly honest,

68
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:15,153
it's been a big adjustment
having you here all the time.

69
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,280
I had no idea kids ate so much.

70
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,782
It's called metabolism.

71
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:22,202
If I don't feed the
beast, he gets loco.

72
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,704
At least take a bowl
with your granola.

73
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,915
Or if you'd like, I
can get you a feed bag!

74
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,752
Weird, but I'm not saying
no to the feed bag idea.

75
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,921
You know, crumbs can lead
to all sorts of problems.

76
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,806
We have a lot of sensitive
equipment in here!

77
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,218
- Okay, I'll throw it out.
- No, I'll throw it out.

78
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,304
- Give... it... ah!
- Ah!

79
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:43,181
Oh, look what you've done!

80
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,017
- What I've done?!
- Megamind: Just clean up the mess, Chum.

81
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:48,728
Keiko and I are about
to film another segment.

82
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:58,571
Whenever I have a question,
I seek the counsel

83
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:01,574
of the handsomest and
wisest person I know.

84
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,826
Myself!

85
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:06,121
And now, so can you
lucky rapscallions!

86
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,540
Time for fan mail! Brainbot?

87
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,336
Number one fan
Terry Sasko writes,

88
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:17,215
"Dear Megamind, what does it
take to become a superhero?"

89
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,927
- Well, Terry, becoming a hero requires a great deal of...

90
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,389
Chum!

91
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,599
Sorry! The mega-vac shorted out.

92
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,061
Someone must have vacu-dried
their capes again.

93
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,396
There's, like, 20 in here.

94
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:35,483
O-Oh, sir? Would you mind
throwing the circuit breaker?

95
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:41,656
Oh, now where was I? Ah, yes!

96
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,617
To be a superhero, one
must be fashionable,

97
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:48,371
punctual, and utterly
brave in any situation,

98
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,582
no matter how
terrifying...

99
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,379
Ew, gross. Are you okay?

100
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,506
Me? Yes, of course!

101
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,592
It's not like I'm
irrationally terrified

102
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,552
that those roaches
will encase me with goo

103
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:03,845
and take me to their queen

104
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,765
and torture me with their
ickiness for all eternity!

105
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,184
Okay, that's really specific.

106
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,186
Ah! There's a lot more of them!

107
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,605
- What is going on?

108
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,648
Megamind saw a
roach and freaked.

109
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,984
I'm not freaked! I
just wanted to know

110
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,487
what it'd feel like
to be Chum's backpack.

111
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,447
Okay, they are
getting way too close!

112
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,741
I warned you about those crumbs.

113
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,052
Sir! Feel free to let Keiko know

114
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,911
how disappointed
you are with her.

115
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:29,996
Uh, sir?

116
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:33,291
Still not freaked! Just
love a good sprint!

117
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,464
- Chum? Keiko?

118
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,132
I am speaking to you from inside

119
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:44,010
my titanium-reinforced
"I Never Panic Room,"

120
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:46,513
where literally
nothing can harm me.

121
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,515
I'm going to need the
two of you to take down

122
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,684
every single one of
those vile creatures

123
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:53,311
that I am  in
no way frightened of!

124
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,647
Sir, this is all Keiko's fault!

125
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,124
- What?!
- Megamind: You both are responsible

126
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,275
for this horrific
breach of security.

127
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:02,070
Meanwhile, I won't be leaving
until those roaches are gone.

128
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,279
But not because I'm scared.

129
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:04,489
I just think this will be

130
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,949
a good team-building exercise.

131
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,575
- Okay, bye!

132
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,203
This way to the roach repellent,

133
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:13,123
which is exactly where I know
it is because I put it there.

134
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:14,666
Yeah, I was thinking

135
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,102
I know another way I
could help around here.

136
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:19,087
You know, organize things in a
way that actually makes sense.

137
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,422
Please.

138
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:23,883
I'm all about organization.
You're an agent of chaos.

139
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:27,095
Okay, Chum. Lately, there's
been this weirdness between us.

140
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,555
Like you don't want me here.

141
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,765
That's absurd. Just
because you and sir

142
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,518
spend all your free time
laughing and making fun videos

143
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,353
while I'm always
on cleanup duty,

144
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,439
why would I not want you here?

145
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,774
Are you jealous?

146
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,735
Is that what this is all about?

147
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,862
You think I'm gonna
take over your spot?

148
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:46,114
There's only room for one
number two around here,

149
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,532
and that's me.

150
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,576
I'm a big number two!

151
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:52,454
Did sir make you your
own pet parakeet? Ka-kaw!

152
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,584
I love
you, too, Polly 227.

153
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,711
Because you're a
cutie-wootie cuckoo bird

154
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,838
who doesn't try to usurp people.

155
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,760
Sir trusts me
because only I know

156
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,261
the ins and outs of this lair.

157
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:11,723
I've even developed a highly
sophisticated lettering system,

158
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,851
so I always know where
everything is at all times.

159
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,645
- You mean an alphabetical system?
- Yes, alphabetical.

160
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,190
But then, you grab the
third bottle to the left,

161
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,901
switch the middle and the third
back and forth three times,

162
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,819
and voilà! Couldn't be simpler.

163
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,363
Wait! You're holding a can of...

164
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,281
Couldn't be simpler!

165
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,291
Intelligence booster?

166
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,460
Yeah, that's gonna be a problem.

167
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,973
No need to panic. No
roaches can get in here.

168
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,425
You're protected
by a titanium steel

169
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,678
cobalt-reinforced
level-seven door

170
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,846
with Corinthian security lining

171
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,933
designed to keep Behemoth
himself from breaking in.

172
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,518
German Voice: Why break in

173
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,187
when you can just walk under?

174
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,567
Chum, Keiko, funny story.

175
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:07,237
There's a roach in
here, and it's talking!

176
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:08,780
- Ah!
- That's right!

177
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:12,617
Your simpleton assistant sprayed
me with an intelligence booster,

178
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,036
and now, I'm a super genius,

179
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,122
just like you!

180
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:18,790
Ah! I beg you!

181
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,834
Stay away, hideous creature!

182
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,962
Hideous creature?
It has a ring to it.

183
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:27,215
But I prefer you
call me Rochelle!

184
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,677
Please, Rochelle!
Don't come any closer!

185
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:32,846
Most people are repulsed by me.

186
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,514
- This is nothing new.

187
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,810
But in you, I sense
unbridled fear.

188
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:42,772
Tell me, where exactly
does this fear come from?

189
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,274
I won't tell you a thing!

190
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,485
My painful childhood
stories are my own!

191
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,696
So, it goes back to childhood.

192
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:53,491
Blast it! Get out of
my giant blue head!

193
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:54,868
What do you want, anyway?

194
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:57,203
For too long, we
roaches have been

195
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,289
at the very bottom
of the food chain,

196
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,458
treated like nothing more

197
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,502
than the disgusting refuse
we've been forced to consume.

198
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,255
We want revenge!

199
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:11,843
- Don't you mean revonge?
- No, it's revenge.

200
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,636
I just learned this
language today.

201
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:16,723
- How do I speak it better than you?

202
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:19,559
You're just a little,
totally not scary bug.

203
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,771
What kind of evil plan could
your tiny brain hatch up?

204
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,981
I'm going to use your spray

205
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:28,860
to make an army of super-evil
intelligent roaches.

206
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,320
We'll take over the city.

207
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:32,697
Then, the world!

208
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,869
That's actually a pretty
airtight evil plan.

209
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,996
- No notes.

210
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,749
Attention! I, Rochelle,

211
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:45,460
hereby assume
control of this lair.

212
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,212
And I order you

213
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,632
to hand over the intelligence
booster immediately!

214
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,467
And if we refuse?

215
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,177
Then, I will do the backstroke

216
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,805
in Megamind's
favorite coffee mug!

217
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:00,392
- We'll buy him a new mug!
- Stop playing with Sir's life!

218
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:03,144
I'm stalling until
we can figure out what to do!

219
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,690
If that is not enough, I
shall shed my exoskeleton

220
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,358
and deposit it in his shoe!

221
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:12,112
- Oh yeah? Well, we'll buy him new feet!
- Huh?

222
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:15,490
If you do not hand me
the spray, I shall scurry

223
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:19,119
all over Megamind's
pathetic blue face!

224
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:20,471
Hand her the spray immediately!

225
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:24,165
- Right away, Sir.
- Chum! That's the fear talking!

226
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,500
We can't let her send an army

227
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,502
of tiny bug villains
out into the world!

228
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,129
Sir is my world.

229
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:30,755
She'll turn him
into a quivering,

230
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,924
mentally scarred
puddle of jelly!

231
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:35,927
Keiko, as the number one
number two around here,

232
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,138
I am insisting that
we hand over the can.

233
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:41,099
Dude, no way we are
handing over this can!

234
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:43,852
- I'll let go if you let go!
- Give it...

235
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:47,647
Time to add some
fuel to the fire.

236
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,447
- Look at you, Megamind.

237
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:59,159
Too scared to lift a pinky
to save your friends.

238
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,036
Please don't drag
my pinky into this.

239
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,038
It's been through
so much already.

240
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,206
If one smart roach
is able to do this,

241
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,751
imagine what a bunch more
could do to the city.

242
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:10,378
- If he wasn't
totally freaking out,

243
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,089
Megamind would want us to
stop her, no matter what!

244
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,258
Okay, then I'll
just crush the can.

245
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,843
Are you crazy?

246
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:18,762
I'll just release the
spray into the air!

247
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:20,805
Give it to me! I'll throw
it in the incinerator.

248
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,184
That will be worse! It'll
release it into the entire city!

249
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,977
There has to be
something in this place

250
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,645
that can destroy a spray can.

251
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:29,689
But we can't just destroy it.

252
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,983
We have to atomize it.

253
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,860
Both: The particle collider!

254
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,578
- Whoa!

255
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,705
Whoa! Chum, catch!

256
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:51,670
Rochelle: Your two companions have
proven to be most troublesome.

257
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:53,963
And that is trouble for you.

258
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:56,633
- What are you gonna do to me?!
- Quiet!

259
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:59,636
- Order your friends to obey me!

260
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:02,722
Ow! How are you so strong?!

261
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,935
This'll zap it into atomic dust!

262
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,606
Okay. It's loading up...

263
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,316
- Wait for it...

264
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,943
Still loading...

265
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,404
And... here we go.

266
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:25,495
- Hazelnut?
- My bad! Had it set for gelato.

267
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,629
They got the can. You guys
are really starting to bug me!

268
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,464
Pun intended! Throw me, Chum!

269
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:42,429
I knew that
trash would come in handy!

270
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:43,805
Whoa!

271
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:47,308
To the time destabilizer!

272
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,354
If we can't destroy it,
maybe we can send it back

273
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,271
- to the Stone Age!

274
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,692
- Yes!

275
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:58,361
Got rid of it just in
the nick of "time."

276
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,488
You see what I did
there? Because we just

277
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,826
You sent it two seconds
into the future!

278
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:08,413
Ooh. Think of all the
things that can has seen.

279
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:09,698
Let loose that caboose, Chum!

280
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,335
They're gaining on us!

281
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,795
We could really use a
set of wings right now.

282
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,423
I've got just the thing. Ka-kaw!

283
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:21,468
Fly, brave parakeet!

284
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:23,678
Away!

285
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:27,474
- Ka-kaw!

286
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:32,187
- Kaw...

287
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,234
I guess we should've
opened the skylight first.

288
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,862
Okay, we are officially
terrible at this.

289
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,405
I'm goin' for it.

290
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,576
This is
like wearing a sweater

291
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:48,328
made of toenail clippings!

292
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,330
Ha, there's more
where that came from

293
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:53,416
if you can't convince your
friends to hand over the spray!

294
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,669
No! I-I won't do it.

295
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:57,962
You may have tapped
into my darkest fears,

296
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:00,924
but you're going to have to find
someone else to be your puppet.

297
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:03,551
Oh. Not a bad idea.

298
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,554
- If I cannot puppet you...

299
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:11,976
then I will assume control
of your robot gorilla!

300
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:12,977
Megamind: Control Chum?

301
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:16,272
That's my job, you monster!

302
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:22,862
Easy does it. Grab
the can, save the day.

303
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,201
Almost...

304
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:29,994
Got it!

305
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:32,872
Hey! I walk with those!

306
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:36,251
Whoa! Chum! What are you doing?!

307
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:39,170
I-I'm not doing this!

308
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,755
Kinda feels like
you're doing it!

309
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:45,719
- Rochelle say, monkey do!

310
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:48,054
Foul beast! This is madness.

311
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,973
Stop me, if you dare!

312
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:53,977
Just reach out your
hand and swat me away.

313
00:14:56,771 --> 00:15:00,233
Come on... Swat, you
cowardly paw! Swat!

314
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:03,611
Do this, and I promise
to start moisturizing.

315
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,280
Swat!

316
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:11,369
So much for Metro City's
greatest hero, eh?

317
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:13,913
Time to pump up the volume!

318
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,793
- Keiko: Whoa! Chum, let me go!

319
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:23,256
Whoa! I'm afraid
that's impossible.

320
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:25,759
Rochelle hacked
into my mainframe!

321
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:27,052
How do we stop it?

322
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:30,680
Uh, the override button!
On the main console!

323
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:33,016
Of course, it's way down there!

324
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,768
I'm going to dance this monkey

325
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:37,896
- right over the edge!

326
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:42,317
Okay, Rochelle.

327
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,111
You wanna know why I'm
afraid of cockroaches?

328
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:47,906
Yes! Tell me. Tell me!

329
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:51,701
I was but a child,
growing up in prison.

330
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:54,913
I didn't have much, but I was
a highly resourceful young lad,

331
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:57,749
repurposing whatever I could
find around the cell block.

332
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:01,044
One day, I decided to craft
a comfy beddy-bye pillow

333
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:04,130
out of a bag of
discarded ham sandwiches.

334
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,466
That night, the
ham-scented pillow

335
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,843
attracted every
roach in the prison.

336
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:12,681
I awoke to find the bugs
using my face as a dining hall

337
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:16,810
at a nightmarish all-you-can-eat
ham sandwich buffet!

338
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,231
Sometimes, I can still
feel their tiny roach feet

339
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:23,942
dancing all over my face!

340
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:26,528
- The horror.

341
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,073
So you are the famous ham boy.

342
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:33,868
For generations, cockroaches
have told the tale of a boy

343
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,579
who did something so
stupid that it led

344
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:40,542
to the greatest feast our
people have ever known!

345
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:43,837
And here you are,
still that scared,

346
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:45,922
stupid little ham boy.

347
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:47,966
Such a tragic story.

348
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:50,885
Also, a distractingly long one.

349
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,011
Wha?

350
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:55,265
- Bullseye!

351
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,892
- Rochelle: Nein!

352
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,062
You did it! I'm rebooting!

353
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,439
Oh! Sorry!

354
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,571
Rebooted!

355
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:12,824
Thanks. That's one mess I'm
glad I didn't make today.

356
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:16,745
Rochelle: The can
is ours!

357
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,914
Your distraction was all
for naught. We've won!

358
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,959
And it's all thanks
to your pathetic fear!

359
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:25,462
Well done, my kinderroaches.

360
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:27,547
Now, who needs a boost

361
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,341
- of intelligence?!

362
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:34,387
What is the value
proposition here?

363
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:36,765
A bouquet really
brightens up a foyer.

364
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:37,682
I love math.

365
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,642
Rochelle: Welcome
to the next phase

366
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:41,603
in roach evolution!

367
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:44,856
Yesterday, we were living
off humanity's scraps.

368
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:47,817
Tomorrow, they will
be living off of ours!

369
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,988
When we control the food,

370
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:54,199
we control the world!

371
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:55,742
Gotta hand it to her.

372
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:58,370
That's a pretty airtight
evil plan. No notes.

373
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:00,455
This is all on me.

374
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,916
None of this would a happened
if I wasn't such a slob.

375
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:06,252
To be fair, I'm the one who
grabbed the wrong spray.

376
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:09,214
You tried to warn me,
but I didn't listen.

377
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:11,966
You were right. I was jealous.

378
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:13,468
Aw, come on.

379
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,233
The last thing I wanna
do is replace you.

380
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:16,137
I admire you.

381
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,662
You and Megamind
have been together

382
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:18,848
like, forever.

383
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:21,267
That's why I feel like
I need to prove myself.

384
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:23,186
Otherwise, I'm
just a third wheel.

385
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:26,564
I think you've proved today
you're not a third wheel, Keiko.

386
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,692
- You're a kickstand.
- Huh?

387
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:32,320
Because without you, we
would've fallen right over.

388
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,614
Aw...

389
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:37,158
Kudos, you two, for working
out your differences.

390
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,363
But there's still the whole

391
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,495
end of the world
thing to deal with.

392
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:45,375
- So many roaches.

393
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:50,255
I-I'm sorry. What were
we just talking about?

394
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,674
- Roaches?
- Yes, of course.

395
00:18:57,429 --> 00:18:59,305
- Move out, roach regime!

396
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:01,641
Victory awaits!

397
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:04,811
We cannot let these
things get out.

398
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:06,813
There's no stopping them now.

399
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:09,649
There's got to be
something more we can do.

400
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:11,901
If only this roach
phobia didn't leave me

401
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:14,654
totally grossed out by all
the little tiny arms and legs.

402
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,489
All due respect, Mega,

403
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,783
but maybe you just
need to suck it up!

404
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:21,703
Suck it up? Keiko,
you're brilliant!

405
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,621
- I am?
- The Power Vac!

406
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:26,291
- It'll just take a minute!

407
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,210
- Or two!
- I'll try and buy you some time.

408
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:32,881
Hey! Who wants some
juicy, delicious garbage?

409
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:35,425
- Aah, an amuse-bouche!
- The temptation is undeniable!

410
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,968
Yeah, I could eat!

411
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:39,471
No, no, no! Resist
your instincts!

412
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:42,515
Why eat garbage when you
can have fillet mignon?!

413
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,184
- That's right. Follow me!

414
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:46,561
Whoa!

415
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:50,106
Wow! You guys really are smart!

416
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:53,318
Chum, can you hurry it up?
They are getting really hangry!

417
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:54,652
Whoa!

418
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:58,281
Almost there. I just
need a crescent wrench.

419
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:01,409
Okay, they're made of iron,
so that must mean I put it in

420
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,244
- the...
- The ironing closet!

421
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:07,290
Yes! That's it, Keiko!
Everything has its place!

422
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,586
- Yeah!

423
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,546
Uh-oh. Whoa! Whoa!

424
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:21,012
- My babies!

425
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,516
- You are liberated!

426
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:27,894
- Now, onward to Metro City!

427
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,896
Schnell, schnell!

428
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:31,564
Chum: Sir, we need
the power back on!

429
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:34,234
- Throw the circuit breaker!
- Right! On it!

430
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:37,612
- Oh dear.

431
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,448
- Throw the switch, Sir!
- Come on! You can do it!

432
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:47,080
Oh! I can't do it!

433
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:49,791
Ha! You have failed
again, Megamind!

434
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,711
If just one of those things
gets out, it's game over.

435
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:54,337
How do we snap him out of this?

436
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:56,756
If Megamind won't listen
to us, maybe he'll listen

437
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:59,634
to the handsomest and
wisest person he knows.

438
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,220
- Ka-kaw!

439
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:04,389
- To be a superhero,

440
00:21:04,514 --> 00:21:06,558
one must be
fashionable, punctual,

441
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:09,352
and utterly brave
in any situation.

442
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:12,439
Earlier today me is right!

443
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:14,774
You cannot win. Look at you!

444
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:18,111
Still just a scared
little ham boy.

445
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:19,237
No.

446
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:22,115
I'm a scared little ham man!

447
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:27,412
- Go, Chum!

448
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:32,125
Way to get all housekeeper
on their thoraxes, Chum!

449
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:36,338
Nein! Nein! Nein...

450
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:40,633
- Yeah!
- Sir, that was amazing!

451
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:43,928
- Ah! You did it!
- Yes, yes! We all did it!

452
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:46,306
Ew, icky, icky, ick, ick, ick!

453
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:50,310
You have not heard
the last of...

454
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:52,479
Yeah, I think we've
heard enough for one day.

455
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:54,939
- In three, two, one.

456
00:21:58,068 --> 00:22:00,904
- Granola?
- More like gra-yes-la.

457
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:02,739
I'll try to watch my crumbs.

458
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:04,324
That's okay, Keiko.

459
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:06,618
I think we've learned
both order and chaos

460
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:08,244
have their place in the world.

461
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,455
And now, so do you.

462
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,499
A place to put my stuff!

463
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:15,043
With my very own
trash can? No way!

464
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:18,088
Megamind: Hopefully, that's
the last we'll see of Rochelle

465
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:19,464
and her brood.

466
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:21,132
So, uh, where are they headed?

467
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:23,802
All the way to
Proxima Centauri B.

468
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:25,929
A planet fit for a roach.

469
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:28,890
Honestly, I think I was far
too kind sending them there.

470
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,477
What?! He sent us

471
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:34,479
to a garbage planet?!

472
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:36,856
Mark my words, Megamind.

473
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:40,485
The roaches will
have their revonge!

474
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:43,321
Now he's
got me doing it.
