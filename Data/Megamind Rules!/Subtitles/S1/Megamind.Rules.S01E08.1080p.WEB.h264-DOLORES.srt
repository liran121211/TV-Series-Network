Machiavillain: I am born anew!

12
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:54,846
You've served me well,

13
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:57,515
my sad, pathetic little puppies.

14
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,893
And now, as we're
about to deliver

15
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,811
our devilish main course,

16
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:04,230
it's time for the flourish!

17
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:06,858
As I once told my
little blue pupil,

18
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:09,819
the key to supervillainy is

19
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:11,571
presentation!

20
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:14,491
- Thank you.

21
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,993
Thank you. N-No,
you're too kind.

22
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:19,662
Ooh! I almost forgot

23
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,414
how beautiful I am.

24
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,083
You look great.

25
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,418
I said I almost forgot,

26
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:28,171
but your sniveling
platitude is noted.

27
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:31,633
When you're reborn, it's like
you're seeing and smelling

28
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,551
and hearing everything
for the first time.

29
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:35,053
Music! I need music!

30
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,601
I said music.

31
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:44,729
Something with style,
not ear torture.

32
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,733
Oh... Mm...

33
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:52,195
Pardon, but was zere
a point to all of zis?

34
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,949
Yeah. When do we get to the
part where we destroy Megamind?

35
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,493
Trying to simply
destroy Megamind

36
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,578
is where you've all failed.

37
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:01,864
We need to do more than that.

38
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:05,625
We have to destroy who
he thinks he's become.

39
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,545
- It's time to
put Metro City's hero

40
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,130
to the test!

41
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,549
We're here at City Hall Plaza,

42
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:16,636
where citizens are gathered
to celebrate Comet Day.

43
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:19,973
Can you believe it?
The Metro City Comet.

44
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:22,559
This only happens once
every hundred years!

45
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,853
Yeah, that's... something.

46
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,397
A whole day of
festivities are planned

47
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:30,066
with Mayor Roxanne
Ritchi presiding.

48
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,860
Hooray for the mayor!

49
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,403
I know her!

50
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:36,031
- We all know her, Chum.
- Excuse me,

51
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,658
but somebody doesn't seem
to be in the proper spirit

52
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:41,327
to watch a 10-mile-wide
chunk of ice, dust,

53
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,997
and small rocky particles
pass by the Earth.

54
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,875
Sorry, I-I just got a
lot on my mind today.

55
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:51,296
Well, Dr. Chum's advice clinic
just happens to be open!

56
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,673
- Come on, let's rap.
- Uh, okay.

57
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,401
It'd be easier if I just
come out and say it,

58
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,926
so hold any comments
and questions

59
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:59,220
for after I'm done
getting it all out.

60
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:00,722
You got it.

61
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:04,309
I kind of gave
Megamind's binky away.

62
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,644
You gave Megamind's binky away?!

63
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,688
A-Ahem. Sorry.
That was a comment,

64
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,857
and I apologize. Please, go on.

65
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:13,026
- To Machiavillain.

66
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,569
Machiavillain's back?!

67
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,863
Oops. That was a question.
I'm really bad at this.

68
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:19,240
But we need to tell Sir
as soon as possible!

69
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,700
It was my mistake.

70
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:24,162
I need to be the one to
tell him. Promise me, Chum.

71
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,122
- Oh boy.

72
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,544
Not too late to get someone

73
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,089
a little more surprising
as our surprise guest.

74
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,717
Even you have to admit,
people love Megamind.

75
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,969
People also love
playing with baboons.

76
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:42,472
That is, until nature
takes its course.

77
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:45,975
Well, my blue guy
hasn't let us down yet.

78
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,812
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's my proud duty

79
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:52,399
to introduce today's
guest and my good friend,

80
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:54,984
- Megamind.

81
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,697
- Crowd: Megamind! Megamind!

82
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:01,116
- Megamind! Megamind...

83
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,992
Where is he?

84
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:09,124
I slept like a
handsome log last night.

85
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,334
Oh, Sir, you're just in
time to see your entrance.

86
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,504
Wait a second. You're supposed
to be at the comet ceremony!

87
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,548
That was today?!

88
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,717
I have to get down there!

89
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:21,261
Chum, where's my good
cape? The black one!

90
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,888
- It's with all the other black ones.
- Megamind: Got it!

91
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,686
Ahem.

92
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:30,895
I know you're in a hurry,

93
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,772
but I need to tell
you something.

94
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,337
Keiko, I'm already
late for an event

95
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:37,027
and what's sure to be an
epic Roxanne brow-beating.

96
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:38,987
It really can't wait!

97
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,322
- Keiko, I really don't have time for...

98
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:45,952
- Well, well, well, if it
isn't my formerly prized pupil.

99
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,912
- Machiavillain!

100
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,290
It can't be. I
thought you were...

101
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:51,434
Machiavillain : Defeated?

102
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,668
Destroyed? Didn't I teach you

103
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:57,172
that it's impossible to keep
a truly bad villain down?

104
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,800
I'm here to find inspiration
for my next evil project.

105
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,887
And here you are, my megamuse.

106
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:07,682
Well, maybe you haven't heard,
but I'm not a villain anymore.

107
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,769
Yes. I can't tell you how
disappointed I was to hear

108
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,812
that you're now batting
for the losing team.

109
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:15,315
Justice might lose a
game here and there,

110
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,400
but we make up for
it in the off-season.

111
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,486
The off-season is
for exhibition games,

112
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,446
but this is the finals,

113
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,323
and I'm heavily favored to win.

114
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,200
It doesn't matter
if you win or lose!

115
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,826
It's how well you play the game!

116
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,953
Then, why even
bother keeping score?

117
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,580
Because! Uh...

118
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,415
- Ha-ha! Gotcha!
- Goh!

119
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,709
Chum, what's happening?

120
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,045
It's almost as if Sir
is at a loss for words.

121
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,713
Blast him!

122
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,257
He knows sports metaphors have
never been my strong suit.

123
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,885
Machiavillain: I came here
to help you, Megamind.

124
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,722
You're caught in an
upward spiral of goodness,

125
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,934
and I came to drag you back
down to where you belong.

126
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,394
Where life is simpler,

127
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,729
and you don't have to think
about things like rules

128
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,065
- or setting a good example for the kiddies.
- Huh?

129
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,528
Get to the point, Machiavillain.

130
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,089
Machiavillain: I came
to offer you a choice.

131
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:06,825
Return to villainy and be
welcomed back with open arms,

132
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,661
or continue this
heroic silliness

133
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,121
and face the ultimate challenge.

134
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:14,082
I choose heroic silliness!

135
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,458
Then know this.

136
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,128
What happens next is on you.

137
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:22,674
And now, it's time

138
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,260
for evil's favorite game show...

139
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,471
Audience : "Who
Wants To Save A City?"

140
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,727
The rules are simple. Megamind,

141
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:36,688
you have one hour to
pass three heroic trials

142
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,107
hidden throughout the city.

143
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:43,361
For each, you'll be given
only one clue to its location.

144
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,738
If you stop all three,

145
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:47,073
I will leave in peace!

146
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:47,907
If you lose, it will mean

147
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,827
utter destruction of Metro City.

148
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,372
Are you ready to see
how good of a hero

149
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,957
- you really are?

150
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:59,336
- Ready, set, go!

151
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:01,046
Time's wasting, Sir!

152
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,051
Keiko, stay here.
Machiavillain is

153
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,595
the most dangerous
individual I've ever known.

154
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,681
Oh, yeah? Well, I owe
that guy some payback.

155
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,725
- Payback?
- I mean...

156
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,518
I just don't like bullies.

157
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,813
Sir, I think we
need to tell Keiko

158
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,565
the truth about Machiavillain.

159
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,067
You're right, Chum,

160
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,735
but I need to be
the one to tell her.

161
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,904
- Promise me.

162
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,198
Why does everyone trust
me with their secrets

163
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:30,116
when I hate keeping them?

164
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:35,056
Roxanne : You better have
an amazing non-sleep-related excuse

165
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,956
- for not being here.
- Roxanne,

166
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,833
I don't have time to apologize.

167
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,503
We're in the midst of a
deadly game of cat and mouse!

168
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,963
- Ready for the first clue?

169
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,009
How on Earth did
you hack my watch?!

170
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,386
Clue number one.

171
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:51,096
The world is your oyster,

172
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,556
but when is it in
your living room?

173
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:55,308
Hm. Clock's ticking!

174
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,060
- Ciao!

175
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,771
Ugh, first sports,
now shellfish trivia?

176
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,107
He's hitting all my weak areas.

177
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,526
Keiko: The world
is your oyster...

178
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,903
The Oyster Nebula!

179
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,239
It's a space cloud,
but also part of

180
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:10,448
the Metro Comet's route.

181
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,866
We learned about this in school.

182
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,661
Okay, but then where do
living rooms come in?

183
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,913
Must be something
everybody has in theirs.

184
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,667
Not alligator pits, not
particle accelerators...

185
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,085
Wait! Televisions!

186
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,755
And the comet is being broadcast
live from the observatory!

187
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,425
- Step on it, Chum!
- You got it, Sir!

188
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:36,474
- Hm. Nothing looks to be amiss, Sir.

189
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,743
Megamind: That's
what worries me.

190
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,061
Keiko, you're with me.

191
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,567
So, this Machiavillain guy.

192
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:49,612
Uh, yes. He taught me everything
I know about being evil.

193
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:52,073
But, I wanted to tell you...

194
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,035
Yeah, you told me already.
But, I wanted to tell you...

195
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,620
But, did I tell you
I had to defeat him

196
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,289
to become a supervillain?

197
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:02,083
Yes! You kicked his butt
once, so you can do it again.

198
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,586
- But, I really...
- Actually, the truth is...

199
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:08,048
Does that guy seem
a little off to you?

200
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:09,692
- Almost as if he's...

201
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,051
Hypnotized!

202
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,638
Bonjour, Monsieur Megamind!

203
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:17,474
Pierre Pressure!

204
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,684
I thought I smelled snails.

205
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,269
It's escargot.

206
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,439
I had them for lunch,
and they were magnifique.

207
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,109
He must be planning
to use the newsfeed.

208
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,154
With everyone at the plaza
watching the ceremony,

209
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,572
he could hypnotize all
of Metro City at once!

210
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,408
Ze poisson-companion is correct!

211
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,244
- Your show's
about to be canceled.

212
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,664
Zat pea-shooter might
work on one Pierre,

213
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,333
but what about...

214
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,710
Pierres: Multiple Pierres?

215
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,090
Oldest villain
trick in the book.

216
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:51,758
You zap the one in the middle!

217
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:54,260
- Piece of cake.

218
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:56,221
- Keiko: More like 100 cakes!

219
00:09:56,346 --> 00:10:00,016
I can't find the middle
if they don't stay still!

220
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,601
Sir, may I recommend

221
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,166
the De-Gun's new
rapid-fire setting?

222
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:04,270
Right!

223
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:05,397
Ha, ha!

224
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:06,898
Take that! Whoa!

225
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,237
- Look out!
- Take cover!

226
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,787
What happened? Was I victorious?

227
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:23,248
Looks like you
debilitated him, Sir!

228
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,709
Vive la France.

229
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,920
Keiko: Also looks like you
debilitated the telescope.

230
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,339
- Ollo?

231
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,799
Don't "ollo" me.

232
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,592
First, you don't
show up to the event,

233
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,052
and now, the comet feed is down,

234
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,905
which I'm assuming has
something to do with you!

235
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:39,973
- Oh, bravo!

236
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,766
Sorry, Roxie. Gotta take this.

237
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,810
Time for clue number two.

238
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:46,396
What a villain seeks
to rule over all,

239
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:49,983
when it is lost,
darkness will fall.

240
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,527
- Much success to you.

241
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,947
He says that, but I'm
not so sure he means it.

242
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,425
The first part of
the clue is easy.

243
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,909
Villains always
seek the same thing.

244
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:01,453
- Power.
- A spa day!

245
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:04,247
I mean, power! You're
probably right, Sir.

246
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,833
But, what kind of power
could make darkness fall?

247
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,186
- Roxanne : It's the power station!

248
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,254
- You're still here?
- Roxanne: Still here!

249
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,256
And who was that
you were talking to?

250
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,383
Thanks for the help,
Roxie. We'll explain later.

251
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,470
- Floor it, Chum!

252
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:26,144
- Huh. Everything looks quiet here.

253
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,814
Lady Doppler: Beware
of a flash flood

254
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,608
of lightning!

255
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,116
You're just in time to see me

256
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:43,453
destroy Metro City
with its own power!

257
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:47,207
Keiko, you distract Doppler
with some trash talking.

258
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:49,668
- I've got an idea.

259
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:52,212
Hey, Doppler! You know
there's no such thing

260
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:53,838
as a flash flood of
lightning, right?

261
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:57,384
Well, if it isn't
Megamind's kid sidekick.

262
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,636
Why don't you go back
to the clubhouse?

263
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:00,970
Adults are talking.

264
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:04,015
Yet, I'm the only one
not in a funny costume.

265
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,102
You're making me rethink
my no-zapping-kids policy.

266
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:10,271
I've seen your aim.
I ain't sweatin'.

267
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:13,483
- Oh, you little...

268
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:16,444
- Time for a fish-monkey fry.

269
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:18,780
- Thirsty?

270
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,992
Water and electricity
don't mix, do they?

271
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,251
- Time to bolt!
- Ah!

272
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:39,300
I just wanna thank our sponsor
for today's festivities.

273
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,845
- Mr. Minion's Meat-sicles.

274
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,932
Power's out across the city.

275
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:49,561
It's gonna be one of those
crazy Metro City days, isn't it?

276
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,733
How's that for a flash flood?

277
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,735
Nice callback, Keiko.

278
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,322
Unfortunately, it looks like
the city's entire power grid

279
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:02,448
is fried, Sir.

280
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,160
The good news is
we're two for three.

281
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:08,288
Yes, it's been a lot
easier than expected.

282
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,749
Which is not like
Machiavillain at all.

283
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:15,045
Oh, what an
inspirational testament

284
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,838
to the power of teamwork.

285
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:20,633
It's now time to play
for the fate of the city!

286
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:24,346
Clue number three. You've done
well and played like a whiz.

287
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:28,475
As for the last location,
it's where your heart is.

288
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:31,102
I believe the old saying goes,

289
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,229
"Home is where the heart is."

290
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:35,190
He's going after the lair.

291
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:38,151
With the grid shut down,
so is our security system!

292
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:41,905
Ugh!

293
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,908
The smell of goodness
in here has to go.

294
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:48,286
Nighty-Knight: Ahem! Megamind's
computer isn't going to work

295
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:49,954
with the city's power out.

296
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,749
The lair's emergency backup
generators should be kicking in

297
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:55,585
in three, two, one.

298
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,714
Brainbot: Intruder
alert. Intruder alert.

299
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:00,965
Intruder alert...

300
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:03,551
Nighty-Knight: Uh, sir?

301
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:07,472
Now, all that was once
Megamind's belongs to me.

302
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:09,683
Brainbot: Intrud...

303
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:14,145
A much better color on you.

304
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,648
- Fly, my pretties!

305
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:19,025
Go make some mischief.

306
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,202
Chum: What's going on?

307
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:32,205
Machiavillain must now
have access to the lair!

308
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,998
He's turned the
brainbots against us!

309
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:37,544
Keiko: Not just us! They're
committing crimes all over the city!

310
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:39,838
- We've
got to shut them down fast!

311
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,381
Sir, the brainbots
are controlled

312
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:43,341
by the lair's
transmitter antenna.

313
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,427
If we can knock it out...

314
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,971
It'll turn off all
the brainbots at once!

315
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:51,349
- Why are
there so many menus in here? Ah!

316
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,643
- Found it!
- The remote to the laser satellite!

317
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:54,936
Brilliant, Sir!

318
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:57,564
The satellite fires
with pinpoint accuracy.

319
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:59,482
I should be able to
take out the antenna

320
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,687
- while leaving the rest of the lair intact.

321
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,862
- Machiavillain: Well, Megamind.

322
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:05,405
Thank you for playing,

323
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,658
but I'm afraid
you've lost the game.

324
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:10,910
Au contraire, mon frere.

325
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:14,205
You see, I've learned a few new
things since Villainy Shool.

326
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,375
- The bad guys always lose.

327
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,886
- We did it!

328
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:31,890
Oh, Megamind.

329
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:34,100
While you were distracted
with the brainbots,

330
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:36,770
I reprogrammed your
targeting system!

331
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:39,147
- Instead of
destroying the transmitter,

332
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:42,233
your laser knocked
the comet off course,

333
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:44,361
causing it to head
straight towards.

334
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:46,738
- Metro City!

335
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:54,245
Everyone, remain calm!

336
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:56,164
Megamind will know what to do!

337
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:59,167
I have no idea what to do!

338
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,628
I'm sure all hope
isn't lost, Sir.

339
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:03,338
Oh, really? Did you not notice

340
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:06,049
the giant comet about
to obliterate the city?

341
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,843
It just seemed like something
I should say right now.

342
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,095
I mean, look at that thing.

343
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,221
- It's huge.

344
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:14,349
It's a hero problem way
above my power grade.

345
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:18,019
Oh, Machiavillain played
me like a blue fiddle.

346
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:20,522
No! He can't win!

347
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,816
Can't you just beat him
like you did last time?

348
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:27,445
Time to tell her the
whole story, Sir.

349
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:32,909
I never intentionally
defeated Machiavillain.

350
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:37,497
- What do you mean?
- When I was a student,

351
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,916
I accidentally left
the gamma chamber on

352
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,418
while heating a burrito.

353
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:42,961
I came back from an errand

354
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:46,256
to find Machiavillain's entire
fortress burned to ashes.

355
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:47,757
I'm not proud of it,

356
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:51,011
but I took credit for
destroying my master.

357
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:54,723
And on that lie, I went from
being an ordinary villain

358
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:56,850
to a super one.

359
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:59,095
There's gotta be something
you haven't thought of yet.

360
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:00,729
Can't we just use the satellite

361
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:03,356
to re-divert the comet
away from the city?

362
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:06,234
It takes too long to
warm up between shots.

363
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:08,528
What about the De-Gun?

364
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:12,198
It's not powerful enough.
I'd have to, I don't know,

365
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:13,801
run it through the
cold fusion generator

366
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:15,201
of the Invisible
Car or something,

367
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:17,328
but that's still a long shot.

368
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:19,497
A long shot is still a chance!

369
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:28,631
- Crowd: Megamind! Megamind!

370
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:30,258
We're here to save the day,

371
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,260
but we're going to
need everyone's help.

372
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,471
Let's move like we have
a porpoise, people.

373
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:48,401
Crowd: Megamind! Megamind!

374
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:50,028
- He's gonna do it!
- You can do it!

375
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:51,946
Kick that flying rock's butt!

376
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:53,448
Hey, comet!

377
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,950
- This one's for the dinosaurs.

378
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:56,910
Ah!

379
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:15,512
You have a plan B, right?

380
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:18,014
That was B through Z.

381
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:21,017
- I'm sorry. I failed, Roxanne.

382
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:30,652
Since this is the end,

383
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:34,155
there's something I
regret never telling you.

384
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,824
What is it?

385
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,410
You are...

386
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:41,121
Machiavillain:
Fear not, citizens!

387
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:43,873
- Machiavillain is here!

388
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:52,882
My binky?

389
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:57,012
One moment while I take care
of this small problem of yours.

390
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:03,309
- Ah-ha!

391
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:29,461
Citizens! From this day forward,

392
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:32,422
you will fear no more!

393
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:36,718
- Metro
City's true hero has arrived.

394
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:40,138
- Finally,
a real hero to save us!

395
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:50,023
Oh, Sir.

396
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:52,108
We've been looking all
over the city for you!

397
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:55,570
I'm just
admiring the symbolism.

398
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,238
It's my own fault,

399
00:19:57,364 --> 00:20:00,408
thinking for a moment I was
smart enough to beat him.

400
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:04,037
Actually, it's my fault.

401
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:07,415
Oh, that's nice of
you to say, but...

402
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,709
No, it's literally my fault!

403
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,836
That's what I've been
trying to tell you!

404
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:14,214
I gave Machiavillain your binky.

405
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:17,425
Why would you do that, Keiko?

406
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:21,721
When you wouldn't train me,
I wanted to prove myself.

407
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,366
I pretended to join
the Doom Syndicate

408
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:25,558
to find out what
they were planning.

409
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:27,769
Machiavillain tricked
me into stealing it.

410
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:31,439
The binky is the last thing
I have from my home world.

411
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,400
It's a source of unlimited power

412
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:35,944
that I don't even
totally understand.

413
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:39,197
I wouldn't blame you if you
never wanted to see me again.

414
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:41,491
I'm nothin' but trouble.

415
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:47,414
Megamind: That's the
last thing I want.

416
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:50,667
Machiavillain tricked us both.

417
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:54,087
Besides, I've always had
a soft spot for trouble.

418
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,219
Oh. A press conference
just started.

419
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:04,431
Machiavillain :
I regret to inform everyone

420
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:07,350
that it was Megamind
who is responsible

421
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:08,977
for this near catastrophe.

422
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:15,150
Yes, it appears that he's
returned to his old evil ways.

423
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:17,152
- Behold!

424
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:19,654
- First, he
neutralized the observatory,

425
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:22,157
which would have acted as
an early warning system.

426
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:24,617
- Then, he
destroyed the power grid

427
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:27,537
to disable any
emergency response.

428
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:31,583
- Next, he unleashed
his brainbots upon the city,

429
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:34,461
giving him just the
distraction he needed to use

430
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:37,464
his own satellite
to divert the comet

431
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:40,508
- right toward Metro City.

432
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:43,887
Oh, it's all lies! All of it!

433
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:46,431
Machiavillain's specialty.

434
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:53,855
Now, now. I know how
shocking this must be.

435
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,567
It's never easy to see someone
so noble fall from grace.

436
00:21:57,692 --> 00:22:00,153
Perhaps our courageous mayor

437
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:02,697
will have comforting
words for us all.

438
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:09,287
Though I question with my
whole heart these accusations,

439
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:11,664
the evidence is overwhelming.

440
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:14,751
I have no choice but
to declare Megamind

441
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:17,295
public enemy number one.

442
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:30,100
It's over. Machiavillain's won.

443
00:22:30,225 --> 00:22:32,060
Not quite yet, Ol' Chum.

444
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:36,898
We still have one
card left to play.

445
00:22:38,817 --> 00:22:40,527
We have to find...

446
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:42,737
- Metro Man.
