- Our time's running out!
- Okay

13
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:56,389
Dentist.

14
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,725
No! Stop guessing "dentist"!

15
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,268
Come on, Chum.

16
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,562
It's scary, it's got a
big mouth, little arms

17
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:05,315
-Oh! I
know! A shark, but with arms!

18
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:08,568
A shark but with arms?!
That's your guess?!

19
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:15,992
A T-Rex, Chum! It was a T-Rex!

20
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:18,161
- Sorry, not sorry.

21
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:21,081
So this is like regular
"Guess That Thing,"

22
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:23,083
but with electric shocks.

23
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:25,752
Yeah, painful ones!
Well, except for Chum.

24
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:28,171
The wattage is pretty
calming on his circuits.

25
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,465
It thure is, Kreiko.

26
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:34,135
This is how we do game night
at the lair, dear Roxie!

27
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,722
Now, are you ready
to guess that thing?

28
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,265
Let's do this!

29
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:40,934
- Megamind: Uh, okay!

30
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,894
This thing is... Um...

31
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,438
Oh, sorry. My brilliant
brain keeps thinking of.

32
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,982
Old English synonyms you
couldn't possibly know.

33
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:51,111
Try me. I'm
no Yorkshire raggedy fishwife.

34
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:52,821
Oh. I've never heard that one.

35
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:55,156
- I-I made it up! Keep going!
- Okay!

36
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:58,868
Remember one time when I
was evil and captured you?

37
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,286
This is what I dangled you over

38
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:01,972
- by the thinnest of strings...

39
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,498
Uh, genetically
modified piranhas!

40
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,418
- Mm, no, the other time.
- Quicksand!

41
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,670
- No, no! A different time!
- Bear traps!

42
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:12,298
- Yes! I dangled you over a pit of bear traps!
- Whew.

43
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,259
- That was close.

44
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,220
Almost as close as
you got to those bear traps.

45
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,473
Piranhas? Bear traps?

46
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,517
You guys have the
weirdest friendship ever!

47
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,436
I think we have a
perfectly normal

48
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:27,647
villain-turned-hero-
slash-reporter-turned-mayor camaraderie.

49
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,650
There's nothing normal
about that sentence at all.

50
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:33,319
I admit our relationship
is a bit unconventional,

51
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,363
but it's kinda like those videos

52
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,991
where a koala is
friends with an eel.

53
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,617
Okay, yeah, it is kinda weird.

54
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,369
Christina: Couldn't agree more.

55
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,580
But I would replace
"kinda" with "very,"

56
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,457
and I'd replace
Megamind with anyone.

57
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:49,044
Sorry. Polls say voters prefer
a mayor with normal friends.

58
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,378
You're still here?

59
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,340
Don't you turn back into
a bale of hay at sundown?

60
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,924
The mayor's work is never done.

61
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,259
We still have to finish

62
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,636
the municipal operations
facility's budget.

63
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,431
Guess the mayor's work is
never interesting either.

64
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:04,559
Hey, man, it's game
night at the lair!

65
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,436
You leave your
manners at the door.

66
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:07,896
- Whoa.

67
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:09,689
Sorry, guys. I gotta head home.

68
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:13,318
Already? It's way
before your curfew!

69
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,570
I have to work on an
extra credit project.

70
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,947
If I don't build a robot
that can throw a tennis ball,

71
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,449
my science teacher
will flunk me.

72
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:21,910
If it's a robot you need,
you're more than welcome to use

73
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:24,454
all the high-tech doodads
the lair has to offer.

74
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,873
Really? I can use
all your cool stuff?

75
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:30,377
Oh, Mr. Schlurg-Peterman might
give me extra-extra credit!

76
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:34,130
- Wait. Bennett Schlurg-Peterman?
- You know her teacher?

77
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,675
We were
inseparable at summer camp.

78
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,235
They didn't even need
to tie us together

79
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,929
- for the three-legged race.
- So, why aren't you hanging out

80
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,224
with this everyday card-carrying
member of the teachers union

81
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:45,767
instead of these
stinking weirdos?

82
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,060
- Hey!
- Hey!

83
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:49,729
- Yipe! Aaah...

84
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,607
Man, I haven't seen
Bennett in years,

85
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,318
but we used to have so much fun.

86
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,529
Like bear trap, piranha fun?

87
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,532
Different in that it was
a more... normal fun.

88
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:03,660
Yeah, we must be talking about
a different Schlurg-Peterman.

89
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,912
Schlurg-Peterman?
Sounds like a law firm

90
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:09,499
- that represents haunted toys.
- Chum: Mm...

91
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,418
Or that noise Chum's making.

92
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:15,630
- Schluuuuuurrrrrrrrrrrg.

93
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,094
Burp McSchlurp Esquire?!

94
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,638
Ritchi Von Coconut Cannon?!

95
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,100
- It's really you!
- I can't believe it!

96
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,102
My science classroom's
down there.

97
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:30,687
It's really not that exciting.

98
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:34,232
Not exciting? To see where
my dear Keiko fills her mind

99
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,360
with test tube wishes
and double helix dreams?

100
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,486
I mostly doodle.

101
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,031
Well, now you can
skee-doodle on home.

102
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,116
I want to experience this solo.

103
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:47,287
Are you sure this isn't about
Roxie and Mr. Schlurg-Peterman?

104
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,122
I said skee-doodle.

105
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,960
Please. What could some
boring normie-normal ton

106
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,463
have to offer
friendship-wise over moi?

107
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,633
♪ Camp Frog Ear!
Camp Frog Ear! ♪

108
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:04,220
♪ If we could, we'd
stay all year! ♪

109
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,263
Huh?

110
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,599
Megamind! What a surprise!

111
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,810
Uh, Bennett, Megamind.
Megamind, Bennett.

112
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,020
Schlurg-Peterman.

113
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,980
Ah, just reminiscing
about summer camp here

114
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,815
with ol' Coconut Cannon.

115
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:19,361
Yikes. Insulting her
stringy coconut-like hair?

116
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,488
Not so nice, Bennett.

117
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,198
I have stringy hair?

118
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,075
Oh, we called her Coconut Cannon

119
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:28,328
because of her killer throwing
skills on the dodge ball field.

120
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,330
Not as killer as
your air muffins

121
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:31,831
on Wet Chili Wednesdays.

122
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,500
You
know, in prison,

123
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:37,253
I invented a snack called
"toothpaste bites."

124
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:40,006
Yes, I know.

125
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,342
Oh! Our
secret handshake!

126
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:44,177
How have we not done that yet?

127
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:48,848
Excuse me, Roxie?

128
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,017
Remember when I trapped
you on a hot air balloon

129
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,352
with tarantulas?

130
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:54,604
- That was fairly enjoyable...
- One, two, three.

131
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:58,149
Both: And pinky! Wazoo! Cronch!

132
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,505
- Bennett: I can't believe we remembered it all!
- Roxie: Oh, I know!

133
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,616
- Oh...

134
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,494
- Chum: Oh, Sir.

135
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,789
- Did you use a taquito as a chocolate milk straw again?

136
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:15,250
Oh, this is a different
kind of agony, Chum.

137
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,711
Like longing mixed with sadness

138
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,838
mixed with feelings
of inadequacy.

139
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,465
Keiko: Sounds like
someone's jealous.

140
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,968
You know, 'cause you
and Roxie are a thing?

141
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,469
We're not a "thing."

142
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,304
Why? Did she say something?

143
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,390
I just figured you guys
were deeply in love,

144
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:32,308
but pretend to be too
busy to realize it

145
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,560
because you're both terrified.

146
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,079
That's how hero
relationships normally work.

147
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:38,815
It's complicated, Keiko.
And I am not jealous!

148
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:41,568
I'm sure my tummy has
nothing to do with the fact

149
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,528
that the goodest thing
that ever happened to me

150
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,739
has replaced me with
her old camp buddy,

151
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,492
and they share nothing
but warm fuzzy memories!

152
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,786
Just wondering,
have you told Roxie

153
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,121
you think she's the goodest?

154
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,415
Which is adorable, by the way.

155
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,417
I grew up in a prison, remember?

156
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,669
I'm new to the
whole friend thing.

157
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:02,589
- Um, hello? Standing right here.

158
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,341
Oh, Chum, I adore you,

159
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,551
but you're more of
a vestigial limb

160
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,387
or a helpful ghost
haunting me for life.

161
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,722
- I'll take it!

162
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,285
- Oh, you don't understand

163
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:15,769
the pain I'm in.

164
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,937
When I was young, I
never even got to play

165
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,106
- a decent game of...
- Robot: Throw!

166
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,775
- Ow!

167
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:24,277
It's actually called
"catch," but yes.

168
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,446
My robot actually works!

169
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:27,739
And just in time for dinner.

170
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,449
Try not to be jealous, okay?

171
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:31,618
So you don't have an old
camp buddy. Who cares?

172
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,829
You're Megamind. You can
do literally anything!

173
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:36,664
Huh...

174
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,667
Keep an eye on my
pal here, will you?

175
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,044
- Hm...

176
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,379
Pal

177
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,047
That's it!

178
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:47,133
Maybe it's time I
make a pal of my own!

179
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,635
Come, come, little robot.

180
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,687
♪ Her pants got eaten
by a crocodile ♪

181
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,106
- Oh yeah.

182
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,692
Ooh! Remember when we
snuck into the cabin

183
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,735
where they kept all
the confiscated candy?

184
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:09,739
I've never thrown
up so many colors in my life.

185
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:14,452
Oh. It's nothing. City social
media account tagged me.

186
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,787
Happens all the... Wait.

187
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:19,124
"Our mayor with her
oh-so-normal teacher friend.

188
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,625
Hashtag relatable."

189
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,212
- Christina...

190
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:25,922
Hey! That's us!

191
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:28,216
I am so sorry about this.

192
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:30,844
I don't normally have
paparazzi, I swear.

193
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,596
It must be weird being
friends with adult me.

194
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,056
I'm cool with it. It feels like

195
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,993
- the most normal thing in the world.

196
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,352
Megamind:  Yes!

197
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,480
And I have a feeling

198
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,357
those normal feelings
are about to change.

199
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,571
Oh!  You
guys come here, too?

200
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:50,780
Roxanne, Bennett,

201
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:53,116
I'd like you to meet
my old camp buddy,

202
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,118
- Pal-3000!

203
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,122
Ollo! We were bunkmates
at Camp Turkey Neck.

204
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:02,542
Oh, the friendship
memories we shared.

205
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:05,462
What? You don't really
expect us to believe

206
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:08,965
this scraggly hunk of metal
is an old friend of yours?

207
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,843
- Your words make me sad.

208
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:15,180
- I am sad now. Hm...

209
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:19,184
I programmed him to be very
in touch with his emotions.

210
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,061
Not advanced AI so much as

211
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,688
a simple copy-paste
of my own heart.

212
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,024
I thought you said
you met at camp.

213
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:29,736
It was a day camp, and that
day happened to be today.

214
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:33,156
And while Pal-3000 may
indeed be made of metal,

215
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:36,743
he and I have just as
strong a bond as you two.

216
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,953
Actually, I might even
argue that we have

217
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,498
an even stronger
bond than you two!

218
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,667
It's not a competition.

219
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:47,087
Perhaps, but you know
what is a competition?

220
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,422
- Limbo!

221
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,216
Come on, limbo!

222
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,968
Who will crash to the
ground on their spine first?

223
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,595
- Oh!

224
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:58,515
- S-So, what's
the deal with you and him?

225
00:09:58,556 --> 00:09:59,849
It's complicated.

226
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:01,810
I'd say he's not
normally like this,

227
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,728
but my nose would start growing.

228
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,607
Like Pinocchio!
Because you'd be lying!

229
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:10,402
You got it!
Shall we finish?

230
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,196
- Enough limbo.

231
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:15,865
Time for Camp Turkey Neck Cheer.

232
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:18,493
Brilliant idea,
robo pal of mine!

233
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,579
- Who's in the neck?
- I'm in the neck!

234
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,707
My neck of the woods?

235
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,042
Your neck of the woods!

236
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:29,879
Both: Turkey Neck! Turkey
Neck! Gobble, gobble, gobble!

237
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:33,591
Ha-ha ha-ha! Memories good.
Shared memories better.

238
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:37,887
- Come on, guys! Gobble!
- You don't have to... Ah!

239
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:39,556
- Gobble, gobble!
- Ow!

240
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:45,520
No! This is the
opposite of normal!

241
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,524
Where is my robot?

242
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:52,569
- Uh,
have you checked the lair?

243
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,238
We're in the lair!
He's due today!

244
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,574
- Dah! I need to stress scroll.

245
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:01,619
Why is my science
project wearing a hat

246
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,413
and throwing donuts
at Megamind?!

247
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,915
Oh, food fight!

248
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:08,168
Just like old times!

249
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:11,129
- Oh no!
- Hey, come on, cut it out!

250
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,965
- Look out! Gonna get ya!
- Ha! Throwing food at you!

251
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:17,594
- So sorry about all this.
- Eh, it's not your fault.

252
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:20,513
We'll try again soon. Yeah,
I'm gonna make a run for it.

253
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,057
Watch out, Pal-3000!

254
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,892
You're about to get
a face full of jelly!

255
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,272
- Oh...

256
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:31,691
Here comes that
awful feeling again.

257
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:34,944
Ha-ha!

258
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:38,448
You just got
Pal-3000'ed in the face.

259
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,618
- You stole my science project?!

260
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,746
No, I borrowed your
science project.

261
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:46,790
The robot isn't even yours?!

262
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,583
No, it's not!

263
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:50,960
You can have him back.

264
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,642
Turns out, it wasn't
enough to relieve me

265
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:54,381
of my churning tummy anyways.

266
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:58,385
Plus, I think Roxie may be
a tad displeased with me.

267
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:01,971
If you could fill a city
bus with a tad, then yes.

268
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:04,683
- It's been fun, Pal-3000,

269
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:09,187
but our lifelong hour of
friendship has come to an end.

270
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:12,023
- Pal-3000: Mm.
- Run along now.

271
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,986
I'm truly sorry, Roxie.

272
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:19,698
L-Let me get these sprinkles
out of your stringy hair.

273
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,825
Come on, science project.

274
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,535
We have my academic
future to save.

275
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,413
-Pal-3000:
Processing... Processing...

276
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,373
Not science project.

277
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:31,543
Pal-3000 is Megamind's
best friend.

278
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:35,380
But, Megamind is no longer
best friend to Pal-3000.

279
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:39,592
Then, Pal-3000 must
find new Megamind

280
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,386
to be best friend.

281
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,348
I think my homework's
freaking out!

282
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,017
Uh...

283
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:49,978
Must find new Megamind.

284
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,023
- Must fight new Megamind.

285
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:55,650
- Must find new Megamind.

286
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,032
Megamind!

287
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,077
Not Megamind.

288
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,539
Uh, think you
could drive faster?

289
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:11,583
Speed is relative, Keiko.

290
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,002
- This is not
the time for relaxation.

291
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:15,420
We've got an
emotionally unstable

292
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:19,257
and potentially dangerous
robot on the loose!

293
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,177
Must replace Megamind.

294
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:24,804
Must find new Megamind.

295
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:28,266
Must find new Megamind.

296
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:32,270
- Megamind. Not Megamind.

297
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,482
- Hey! What are you doing?
- Throw!

298
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,108
Whoa!

299
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:40,987
- Friend: Dude, you okay?
- Pal-3000: Ha-ha ha-ha. Memories good.

300
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,073
- Shared memories better.

301
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:45,408
Feeling melancholy.

302
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,702
Hm. Want to journal.

303
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,705
Roxie: He just tossed that
civilian like a rag doll!

304
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:51,873
Megamind: Uh, yeah,

305
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:54,084
so I may have reinforced
his metal body

306
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,335
with space alloy

307
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:57,921
and made him 1,000 times
stronger than a human.

308
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:58,922
- What?!

309
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,882
Oh, sure. It sounds crazy now,

310
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:03,176
but what if we were in
a tug-of-war contest?

311
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:08,473
Not Megamind! Throw!

312
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:12,060
- Not Megamind! Throw!

313
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,979
- Not Megamind!

314
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:17,691
- Throw!

315
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:23,738
Unbelievable! All of this
just because you were jealous.

316
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,115
What? This is all because of

317
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:26,950
that diabolical
Schlurg-Peterman.

318
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,952
Bennett?! What did he do?

319
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,454
I don't know, but
for some reason,

320
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:32,872
I don't like the guy!

321
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:34,624
Again, all of this
could have been avoided

322
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:37,210
if you both just clearly
defined your relationship.

323
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:40,463
Both: It's complicated,
Keiko!

324
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:44,009
Pal-3000: Not Megamind.
Not Megamind. Not Megamind.

325
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,386
- Not Megamind.

326
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:49,264
You gotta do something!

327
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,975
- Nice knowing you, Pal-3000.

328
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:54,144
No! I still need him
for my science grade!

329
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:57,230
Ugh. It's gonna be absolutely
impossible to tame him.

330
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:59,024
Just pretend to be
his friend again,

331
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,292
so we can make him go to school.

332
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:03,403
- Not Megamind...
- I'd rather not. He's so needy.

333
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:06,823
It can make him so
unpleasant to be around.

334
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:08,700
Sounds like someone I know.

335
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:11,327
Yeah. Bennett, am I right?

336
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:12,704
Not Megamind! Not Megamind!

337
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:13,955
Not Megamind!

338
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:18,335
Not Megamind.
Not Megamind. Not Megamind. Not...

339
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,354
Giving him what he wants is
the only way to stop this,

340
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:22,172
and what he wants is you.

341
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:24,758
- Megamind...

342
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,386
Gah. Can't you just make
do with a lower GPA?

343
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:31,848
Colleges care far more about
extracurriculars, you know.

344
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,475
If I don't get extra
credit, I fail.

345
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:36,353
If I fail, my mom won't let me
hang out at the lair anymore.

346
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,938
She won't let me hang
out with any of you!

347
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,399
I should
step it up then.

348
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:44,027
But, if I pull something doing
the Turkey Neck Cheer again,

349
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:46,780
- I expect foot massages from all of you.
- No!

350
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,199
- Absolutely not.
- I got first dibs!

351
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,077
- Not Megamind. Not Megamind.

352
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:54,245
Yoo-hoo! Pal-3000!

353
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:57,248
- My bestest friend.

354
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,417
- Megamind!

355
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,712
- Ha ha ha.

356
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:10,053
You look hungry.

357
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:11,388
Uh...

358
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:16,059
Trust fall!

359
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:17,936
Oh, no.

360
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,734
Pal-3000: Throw. Catch.

361
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,569
Throw. Catch.

362
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:29,489
- Throw. Catch.

363
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:31,408
Lead him over here!

364
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:35,453
Uh, why don't we go this way?
More friendship fun to be had.

365
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,706
There? Processing.

366
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:40,333
- Processing. Analyzing new data.

367
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,920
Megamind led me to girl who
called me science project.

368
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:45,964
Ultimate betrayal detected.

369
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:49,968
Engage tantrum protocol.

370
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,177
- Hey!

371
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:54,347
- Calm down! It's okay!

372
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:57,100
- Megamind will not leave Pal-3000.

373
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:01,062
This friendship is
officially toxic!

374
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,480
Aah!

375
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:05,483
- Megamind!
- Sir!

376
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:12,407
Up, where nobody can stop us.

377
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:13,950
Ha-ha!

378
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:17,120
Ah, this
will all be fine.

379
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:19,247
- Woo!

380
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:24,669
Ah!

381
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:28,048
We don't need gun
for friendly fun.

382
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:31,217
Oh, blast that magnetic alloy!

383
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:34,220
That I added. Why must
I always overachieve?

384
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:36,639
- What do we do?!
- I don't know! Chum,

385
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,433
- I forget. Can you fly?

386
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:42,896
Nah. The space alloy I'm
made of is super heavy.

387
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:44,105
- Yow!

388
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:46,399
That's it! If the
orb calms Chum,

389
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:48,485
and they're made out
of the same stuff...

390
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:51,363
You are thinking
of other friends.

391
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:52,906
- Mm-mm-mmm!

392
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,324
Ah! Of course not!

393
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:57,410
Uh, come here, you huggable
pal! Let's play a game.

394
00:17:57,452 --> 00:17:59,579
How about Guess That Thing?!

395
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:03,416
Not with Roxanne, but
with you, my real friend.

396
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:06,711
Oh, a game? Yes, please!

397
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:10,048
Guess That
Thing! On game night,

398
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,426
we all had to play with these
small, round, dangerous things.

399
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:17,263
- Remember?!
- Game night does not compute.

400
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:19,766
The electrified orb!

401
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:22,268
No! No! Not the orb of calmness!

402
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:26,314
We have to throw it to
Pal-3000 to save Megamind.

403
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:29,234
- Soon, they'll be too high up. This is our one shot.

404
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,277
Can't you throw it
up there? For Sir?

405
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,950
I can't!

406
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:39,703
You'll have to! For Sir!

407
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,498
- Come on, Coconut Cannon.

408
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:45,417
You got this.

409
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,669
- Hey, Pal-3000!

410
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:49,170
Catch!

411
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:52,465
- Catch! My favorite game.

412
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,387
- Megamind: Chum, grab it!

413
00:18:57,429 --> 00:19:01,391
Oh, my
beautiful orb!

414
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:04,477
Pal-3000: Ah... Taking nap now.

415
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:07,439
I may not have
thought this through!

416
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,484
- Chum!  I'll do it.

417
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:14,904
- Decelerate! To slow their fall!

418
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:18,033
Ah. I see you paid some
attention in science class.

419
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:21,327
Breathe. Aim. Shoot.

420
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:28,835
O... kay.

421
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:35,342
Good... aim... Roxanne...

422
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:37,969
Nope! No time for your
decelerated thoughts!

423
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,346
I got a class to pass!

424
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:41,931
Okay, Pal-3000.

425
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:46,061
Throw the ball.

426
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:50,857
Hum... I will never be
Megamind's best friend.

427
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:53,693
What's the point?

428
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:55,737
What's the point of
anything, anyway?

429
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:59,616
Mr. Schlurg-Peterman, you saw
what Pal-3000 is capable of!

430
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:02,202
Ooh, sorry. Rules are rules.

431
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:04,204
Unless he throws
that ball, you fail.

432
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:12,712
Look, Pal-3000. I made
you to be my best friend.

433
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:15,799
But I saw today that you
can't just make a friend.

434
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:19,552
You can't force someone to
feel how you want them to.

435
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:22,263
Friendship is more
like a game of catch.

436
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:23,515
It's give and take.

437
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,768
And today, I was
a real ball hog.

438
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:30,689
I'm sorry.

439
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:35,360
And I'm sorry I was
going to throw you off

440
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:37,112
the top of a skyscraper.

441
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:39,739
That's oka... Wait, what?

442
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:42,617
Oh, hey, someone give
me that ball to throw.

443
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:45,537
- Throw!
- Robot: Catch.

444
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:46,746
Keiko: Whoa!

445
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:50,041
Don't be surprised. I
am up to my eyeballs

446
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,501
in extra-credit robots.

447
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:55,046
- A lot of kids are failing.
- Analyzing. A new friend.

448
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:59,926
Conclusion, vastly
superior to Megamind.

449
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:03,346
Vastly superior?
I don't like that.

450
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:05,598
Recognize a good thing?

451
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,768
Robots: Ha ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha ha...

452
00:21:10,562 --> 00:21:14,149
Alright, Keiko.
You now have a B-.

453
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,818
Yes! Can we have another
game night to celebrate?

454
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:19,320
- Of course!
- How about 8:30?

455
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:21,614
- Absolutely.
- Roxie! You in?

456
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:24,325
Oh, we were gonna
finish our meal.

457
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:30,165
I guess I'm cool with
you two hanging out.

458
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:33,877
Oof!

459
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:36,463
Puddles of poodles, that hurt.

460
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:38,214
Pal-3000: My bad.

461
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:45,638
Uh...

462
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,849
- A giraffe on a sailboat!

463
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:50,935
- Lasagna! The War of 1812!

464
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:55,523
These are all horrible guesses!

465
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:58,360
- Roxie. Where's Bennett?

466
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:02,489
Turns out, we don't have a lot
in common beyond camp memories.

467
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:06,493
And sure, you and I have
some not-so-fun memories,

468
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:07,994
but who cares?

469
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:10,705
We have all the time in
the world to make new ones.

470
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:12,457
Like today, when I saved you

471
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:13,917
from being thrown
off a building.

472
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:17,170
Or when you shot that De-Gun
at me with perfect aim.

473
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:20,173
I've never been so decelerated.

474
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:23,176
O-Or when that robot tossed
that guy into the garbage!

475
00:22:24,636 --> 00:22:26,471
That was actually very scary.

476
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:28,932
And how about that
throw, Coconut Cannon?

477
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:30,684
Oh, stop.

478
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:38,358
- Uh, you do know that's still counting down, right?

479
00:22:40,694 --> 00:22:42,779
That is quite calming.

480
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:44,322
- Ow!
