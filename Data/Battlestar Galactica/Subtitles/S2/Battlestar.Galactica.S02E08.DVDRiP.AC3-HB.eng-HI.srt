The refinery captain
is still not cooperating.

00:00:24,523 --> 00:00:28,220
And now, seven other container ships
are refusing to release their supplies.

4
00:00:28,331 --> 00:00:29,958
Frak this!
I'm sending in the marines.

5
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:32,659
Tell them to get over there
and bring back the supplies.

6
00:00:32,694 --> 00:00:34,536
People, step back, all right?

7
00:00:34,571 --> 00:00:36,413
We're just here
for the supplies. All right?

8
00:00:36,448 --> 00:00:38,256

Cease fire! Cease fire!

12
00:00:44,171 --> 00:00:46,071
You shot people

13
00:00:46,106 --> 00:00:47,424
The crowd was out of control.

14
00:00:47,436 --> 00:00:49,195
Somebody took a shot.
I don't know who it was.

15
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,955
Then all hell broke loose.
It was an accident.

Yeah.

Madam President,
it's an honor.

49
00:02:22,155 --> 00:02:24,419
Cmdr. Adama. Where did you get the tape?

50
00:02:26,987 --> 00:02:28,511
From an anonymous patriot.

51
00:02:30,123 --> 00:02:33,354
So, is this a social call or are
we on the verge of another coup?

52
00:02:33,675 --> 00:02:34,733
Funny.

53
00:02:36,043 --> 00:02:38,034

<i>I take it I'm here because you are unhappy
with my story on the Gideon Massacre?</i>

What happened aboard
the Gideon was a tragedy.

56
00:02:49,611 --> 00:02:51,101
But it was not a massacre.

57
00:02:51,115 --> 00:02:54,482
But the tape shows your men firing
into a crowd of defenseless civilians.

58

My marines tell
a different story.

59

unlimited access to his crew and his ship.

That's right.
Unlimited access.

65

Yeah, with good reason,
ma'am.

00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:31,811

with good reason.

<i>But I want to show the people what life
aboard the Galactica is really like.</i>

73

I want to put a human face on
the officers and the crew...

74
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:42,819
who protect us against Cylons
and guard our freedoms every day.

75
00:03:43,947 --> 00:03:45,915
You might not like that face
when you see it.

76
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,059
What would that be?

77
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:50,541
All we really want
is a balanced story.

cracking some heads.

92
00:05:52,011 --> 00:05:54,502
Sorry, sir, they were

93
00:05:54,537 --> 00:05:55,965
I've been meaning
to throw them out.

94
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:57,003
No.

95
00:05:58,282 --> 00:06:00,477

The President did say, "Total
access." You'll have that.

100
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:17,815
But you start shooting anything that
compromises the safety of the ship...

107
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:40,961
Yeah, well,
you better get used to it.

108
00:06:40,971 --> 00:06:44,031
We may be short on pilots till the

Oh, you were top of the list.

117
00:07:04,043 --> 00:07:06,773

you wouldn't know Caprican poetry...

138
00:08:04,939 --> 00:08:07,699
Kat, you want to tell me what
the hell you think you're doing?

139
00:08:07,734 --> 00:08:10,459
I was just saying hi to some
of my buddies on the fleet, sir.

140
00:08:10,494 --> 00:08:11,434
Right.

141
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:14,628
So you were literally
talking out of your ass.

142
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:15,947
Kind of.

143
00:08:17,515 --> 00:08:19,005
Go on, get dressed.
Yes, sir.

144
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:20,486
Castanza, get the hell
out of here.

145
00:08:20,491 --> 00:08:24,086
It's the last time you come into
senior officers' quarters. Go. Move.

146
00:08:26,091 --> 00:08:28,218
So, you must be the reporter
we were expecting.

147
00:08:28,253 --> 00:08:30,102
Well, you didn't have to
dress for me.

148
00:08:30,795 --> 00:08:32,695
D'Anna Biers,
Fleet News Service.

149
00:08:36,426 --> 00:08:39,477
Capt. Lee Adama, Commander of the
Air Group, that's pronounced "CAG."

150
00:08:39,512 --> 00:08:42,529
And I suggest you find yourselves
an exit as soon as possible...

151
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,568
and that's pronounced, "ASAP."

152
00:08:50,315 --> 00:08:52,613
I think we've seen
all we need to see here.

153
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:59,444
Whose brilliant idea was that?

154
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:01,610
How did your family respond?

155
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:03,769
My Dad went crazy
when I enlisted.

156
00:09:04,395 --> 00:09:06,420
He thought the military
was a joke.

157
00:09:07,435 --> 00:09:10,461
A refuge for emotional
cripples and patriotic fools.

158
00:09:10,475 --> 00:09:12,136
But you signed up anyway.

159
00:09:12,683 --> 00:09:14,981
I guess I just wanted to
believe in something.

160
00:09:18,635 --> 00:09:20,102
You think it'll give it
more memory?

161
00:09:20,107 --> 00:09:23,133
Yeah, it seems pretty simple.
Maybe just a basic adjustment.

162
00:09:23,168 --> 00:09:25,677
It's a pretty good piece.
Yeah, it's kind of old.

163
00:09:25,712 --> 00:09:27,200
(D'Anna)
Maybe I need a new one.

164
00:09:29,546 --> 00:09:31,544
What the hell is going on?
I don't know.

165
00:09:31,579 --> 00:09:33,542
You don't know.
I'm the Vice President.

166
00:09:33,547 --> 00:09:35,336
She's supposed to be
interviewing me, isn't she?

167
00:09:35,371 --> 00:09:37,805
Well, of course she should. Your
title alone commands respect.

168
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,761
Of course it does. It's a
rare commodity around here.

169
00:09:39,796 --> 00:09:41,086
I mean,
I'm the Vice President.

170
00:09:42,218 --> 00:09:44,243
I'm not going beg.
I'll tell you that much.

171
00:09:53,642 --> 00:09:55,200
(Dualla)
Miss Biers, our next stop...

172
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,542
Now, Gaius,
you may have to beg.

173
00:09:57,547 --> 00:10:00,675
You'll do whatever's necessary
to protect our child.

174
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:05,706
Politics may not be your strong
suit, but it serves us in the moment.

175
00:10:06,922 --> 00:10:09,755
Trust me.
This one can help us.

176
00:10:10,987 --> 00:10:12,545
Mr. Vice President?

177
00:10:15,435 --> 00:10:16,561
Hello.

178
00:10:16,586 --> 00:10:18,884
Hi. D'Anna Biers,
Fleet News Service.

179
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,363
Oh, you're the reporter.

180
00:10:23,371 --> 00:10:27,068
That's right. Cmdr. Adama said the
News Service might be joining us.

181
00:10:28,267 --> 00:10:29,757
I suppose you're...

182
00:10:30,443 --> 00:10:33,241
well, very busy doing a lot
of interviews, I would imagine.

183
00:10:33,276 --> 00:10:35,912
Well, I would love
to speak to you.

184
00:10:35,947 --> 00:10:38,040
If you've got a second,
we can do it now.

185
00:10:38,075 --> 00:10:41,622
No. I'm afraid not.
I am very busy.

186
00:10:41,738 --> 00:10:44,206
Really, really busy, at
the moment. Snowed under.

187
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:48,953
But if you get in touch with one of my
aides, there might be a small window tomorrow.

188
00:10:48,988 --> 00:10:50,599
I'm not promising anything,
honestly.

189
00:10:50,634 --> 00:10:53,899
But, I might be able to
give you an interview then...

190
00:10:54,443 --> 00:10:56,468
if that's what
you would like.

191
00:10:57,483 --> 00:11:01,613
Good. Good. Well, you just... carry on.

192
00:11:08,714 --> 00:11:10,238
What a strange little man.

193
00:11:12,587 --> 00:11:13,519
(D'Anna)
Capt. Adama...

194
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,879
I hardly recognized you
with your clothes on.

195
00:11:17,227 --> 00:11:19,976
Look, I'm sure you thought
it was clever...

196
00:11:20,011 --> 00:11:24,539
busting into the pilot's duty locker,
but the area's off-limits for a reason.

197
00:11:24,574 --> 00:11:28,072
It's the one place where my
people can unwind, be themselves.

198
00:11:28,107 --> 00:11:31,634
You seem to think that your pilots
deserve special consideration.

199
00:11:33,355 --> 00:11:34,879
Actually, I do.

200
00:11:35,435 --> 00:11:36,868
Like everyone else...

201
00:11:37,387 --> 00:11:40,686
my pilots have lost their
families, their friends...

202
00:11:41,227 --> 00:11:43,218
everyone they ever
cared about.

203
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:46,236
But on top of that, they are asked
to put their lives on the line...

204
00:11:46,271 --> 00:11:47,586
every single day...

205
00:11:47,595 --> 00:11:50,291
for a fleet that seems more
interested in what they do wrong...

206
00:11:50,326 --> 00:11:52,184
than in what they do right.

207
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:56,769
They're not asking for your pity, but
they damn well deserve your respect.

208
00:11:58,315 --> 00:11:59,577
[Men chattering]

209
00:12:00,714 --> 00:12:02,909
Gods, Chief, we've already
run this up twice.

210
00:12:03,275 --> 00:12:05,300
Yeah, something doesn't
feel right. What?

211
00:12:05,547 --> 00:12:08,175
Something doesn't feel right.
Well, hurry up.

212
00:12:14,475 --> 00:12:15,464
[Grunts]

213
00:12:15,499 --> 00:12:16,761
That's it.
Great.

214
00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:19,284
Oh, that's fantastic.
That's just great.

215
00:12:19,402 --> 00:12:21,736
I knew it.
How did I miss that?

216
00:12:21,771 --> 00:12:24,331
Maybe if your knuckledraggers
spent more time on maintenance...

217
00:12:24,366 --> 00:12:25,766
and less time
frakking around...

218
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:28,261
This knuckledragger
just saved your ass, sir.

219
00:12:28,746 --> 00:12:30,680
Why don't you say that
a little louder, Chief?

220
00:12:30,715 --> 00:12:31,928
I don't think
the camera heard you.

221
00:12:31,946 --> 00:12:33,921
You know what? Frak the
camera. You've been riding my...

222
00:12:33,956 --> 00:12:35,897
Don't even try defending...
... for no frakking reason!

223
00:12:35,932 --> 00:12:37,440
Knock it off!

224
00:12:37,931 --> 00:12:40,195
Chief, fix the ship.

225
00:12:40,522 --> 00:12:42,080
Yeah, fix the...
Hey!

226
00:12:42,506 --> 00:12:44,497
What?
Hey, enough!

227
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:48,303
Chief, fix your ship. You
get the hell out of here, now.

228
00:12:48,338 --> 00:12:49,702
Get the camera out of my face.

229
00:12:52,427 --> 00:12:54,019
[Thudding]

230
00:12:59,338 --> 00:13:02,569
She has been pissing me off all
week. What the hell's going on?

231
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:06,678
I'm taking her off rotation until
she gets her head rewired. I mean...

232
00:13:08,426 --> 00:13:10,407
Can't do it.
We need the pilots.

233
00:13:10,442 --> 00:13:14,173
Besides, if I scratched everyone
who popped off at the Chief...

234
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:17,025
the cooks would be flying
the missions. Son of a bitch.

235
00:13:20,075 --> 00:13:22,976
Did you get all that?
You happy? Come on.

236
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,219
Walk away.

237
00:13:32,522 --> 00:13:34,663
We were never trained
for crowd control.

238
00:13:34,698 --> 00:13:38,099
First order of business when under
attack is defend yourself and your squad.

239
00:13:38,134 --> 00:13:39,516
But these were civilians.

240
00:13:39,531 --> 00:13:42,159
I have 10 stitches that say
we were under attack.

241
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:46,054
Truth is, it was a command frak-up the
moment Tigh put us on that supply ship.

242
00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:49,443
I'm not surprised someone's trying
to take out that drunk son of a bitch.

243
00:13:49,478 --> 00:13:51,820
All right. Private. Belay that.
Col. Tigh's been threatened?

244
00:13:51,855 --> 00:13:53,651
No. This interview's over.
Shut that off.

245
00:13:54,602 --> 00:13:57,002
Commander.
Watch your step, please.

246
00:13:57,642 --> 00:13:58,939
Okay, come on.

247
00:14:03,306 --> 00:14:04,739
Sitrep.

248
00:14:05,418 --> 00:14:08,819
Fleet's quiet, no enemy
contact for the last 10 days.

249
00:14:09,706 --> 00:14:11,799
No Cylon contact, anyway.

250
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:15,124
Well, they have their
job to do. We have ours.

251
00:14:16,426 --> 00:14:18,634
Did you hear about
the meeting on Cloud Nine?

252
00:14:18,669 --> 00:14:20,940
Reps flying in from every
vessel in the fleet...

253
00:14:20,975 --> 00:14:23,144
for a king-size bitch session?
Yeah, I've heard.

254
00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:25,943
Well, they sent us an
invitation to send a delegation.

255
00:14:25,978 --> 00:14:27,058
You're it.

256
00:14:28,874 --> 00:14:31,001
Do you mind? (D'Anna) No, no. Go ahead.

257
00:14:34,026 --> 00:14:35,220
We're in.

258
00:14:35,242 --> 00:14:38,023
I'm not exactly the most popular
guy in the fleet right now.

259
00:14:38,058 --> 00:14:42,119
Well, it'll be good then, to let your
cutters know that you're not afraid of them.

260
00:14:42,154 --> 00:14:44,622
That what you think?
I've been hiding?

261
00:14:50,282 --> 00:14:52,359
What the hell is
going on here, Bill?

262
00:14:52,394 --> 00:14:56,125
You've been doing this too long. We
were worried about ulterior motives.

263
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,409
You're going because you're not
afraid and people should see that.

264
00:14:59,659 --> 00:15:02,184
Plus, it'll also give people a
chance to vent their feelings...

265
00:15:02,219 --> 00:15:03,849
instead of seething
in private.

266
00:15:03,851 --> 00:15:08,015
And finally,
I think you need a little R&R.

267
00:15:09,163 --> 00:15:11,688
So consider this
mandatory shore leave.

268
00:15:12,043 --> 00:15:14,876
Take a swim. Get some sleep.

269
00:15:15,818 --> 00:15:17,979
Sir.
And...

270
00:15:18,538 --> 00:15:20,267
stay away from the bar.

271
00:15:26,122 --> 00:15:29,148
Three. There's three.
So, you got lots.

272
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:32,044
(Starbuck) Good luck, Colonel.
Have fun on Cloud Nine.

273
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,292
You bet.

274
00:15:38,954 --> 00:15:40,251
[Hissing]

275
00:15:50,986 --> 00:15:52,578
<i>Initiating pre-flight.</i>

276
00:15:57,194 --> 00:15:59,992
What's going on? Abort
launch! Everybody out, now!

277
00:16:00,027 --> 00:16:01,240
[Alarm blaring]

278
00:16:06,859 --> 00:16:09,987
Everybody back.
Get back, now.

279
00:16:24,106 --> 00:16:25,471
What's going on?

280
00:16:25,482 --> 00:16:28,542
The main bus is totaled. Looks
like somebody took a hammer to it.

281
00:16:30,218 --> 00:16:33,449
If this had blown in transit, the
cabin would have vented to space.

282
00:16:45,194 --> 00:16:48,027
Someone's trying to kill you,
Saul. Comes with the stripes.

283
00:16:48,062 --> 00:16:50,469
<i>It's because of
that damned Gideon incident.</i>

284
00:16:50,504 --> 00:16:52,876
Ellen, we don't know that.
Of course we do.

285
00:16:54,474 --> 00:16:56,583
D'Anna Biers left
two messages already.

286
00:16:56,618 --> 00:16:58,375
She's giving you the chance
to tell your side.

287
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:01,504
I don't have to explain
myself, especially to her.

288
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:06,695
Roslin wants to
placate the fleet...

289
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,699
put the great Bill Adama
back on his pedestal.

290
00:17:09,706 --> 00:17:12,834
The fastest way to do that
is by hanging you out to dry.

291
00:17:13,386 --> 00:17:15,684
Why do you think Adama wanted
to send you to Cloud Nine?

292
00:17:15,719 --> 00:17:17,558
<i>The Gideon happened
on my watch.</i>

293
00:17:17,593 --> 00:17:18,536
Yes.

294
00:17:19,146 --> 00:17:22,843
But you didn't order
those jar-heads to open fire.

295
00:17:25,162 --> 00:17:27,494
[Sighing]
This is so like you, Saul.

296
00:17:28,746 --> 00:17:33,183
Always the proud soldier, taking
the heat because it's honorable.

297
00:17:35,691 --> 00:17:40,458
When are you going to realize
we're all alone out here?

298
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:14,576
[Sighing]

299
00:18:15,659 --> 00:18:18,253
(D'Anna) Are you afraid
when you go into combat?

300
00:18:18,858 --> 00:18:21,759
First thing they tell you is
to assume you're already dead.

301
00:18:21,794 --> 00:18:23,298
Well,
that sounds ghoulish.

302
00:18:23,786 --> 00:18:25,219
Yeah, maybe.

303
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:28,976
But dead men don't get scared
or freeze up under fire.

304
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:33,256
Me, I'm just worried that hell's
going to be a lonely place...

305
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:36,692
and I'm gonna fill it up with
every toaster son of a bitch I find.

306
00:18:37,162 --> 00:18:39,153
What's been
the hardest for you?

307
00:18:39,434 --> 00:18:43,768
They try to turn off the human part of
you because that's what'll get you killed.

308
00:18:45,482 --> 00:18:48,417
But when you're out in the
field, it's not that easy.

309
00:18:50,122 --> 00:18:51,783
Nothing's that easy.

310
00:18:57,962 --> 00:18:59,623
(guard)
You got five minutes.

311
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,543
Sharon? It's me.

312
00:19:04,938 --> 00:19:05,927
Sharon!

313
00:19:07,658 --> 00:19:10,024
Give me your light. What the
hell are you talking about?

314
00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:12,292
Give me your light, now.
Something's wrong.

315
00:19:17,034 --> 00:19:19,264
Oh, gods. Call Dr. Cottle.

316
00:19:19,562 --> 00:19:20,551
(Helo)
Now!

317
00:19:20,586 --> 00:19:21,678
[Crying]

318
00:19:24,842 --> 00:19:27,310
(D'Anna) Does that help
you cope with the stress?

319
00:19:27,722 --> 00:19:28,882
Not really.

320
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:34,231
<i>Look, all that I ever wanted was
to be an officer on a Battlestar.</i>

321
00:19:34,314 --> 00:19:38,454
Okay, I trained my whole life, trained
harder than anyone in my unit...

322
00:19:38,489 --> 00:19:42,594
<i>basically, I put my life on hold
until I was assigned to Galactica.</i>

323
00:19:44,426 --> 00:19:48,829
Then the Cylons hit and I realized
that this is all that I know.

324
00:19:49,578 --> 00:19:51,975
Tech manuals, commands,
and tactics.

325
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:54,604
You know, I'm not saying
that I'm unhappy.

326
00:19:55,018 --> 00:19:56,986
Just wondering if
there's something more.

327
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:58,959
And what have you
discovered?

328
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,502
I hate cigarettes.

329
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:04,519
[Coughs]

330
00:20:05,418 --> 00:20:07,318
Ambrosia's good with a chaser.

331
00:20:08,234 --> 00:20:11,169
And if you have
enough ambrosia...

332
00:20:15,658 --> 00:20:17,421
they don't really
hurt that much.

333
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:21,140
There you go. We'll make
this as painless as possible.

334
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,074
Drink?

335
00:20:24,106 --> 00:20:26,023
Is this an interview
or a cocktail party?

336
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,652
Are you kidding? This is
how we keep it painless.

337
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:30,745
Just like to keep it casual,
that's all.

338
00:20:31,306 --> 00:20:32,568
Please.

339
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,950
Cheers, Colonel.
Cheers.

340
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:40,173
Before we begin...

341
00:20:41,642 --> 00:20:44,736
I had heard rumors that,
that you had death threats...

342
00:20:44,771 --> 00:20:46,274
leveled against you.
Is that right?

343
00:20:46,282 --> 00:20:49,843
This is a military vessel. We
have rumors for every occasion.

344
00:20:50,986 --> 00:20:54,319
Was it hard for you to take over your
friend's command when he was shot?

345
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:57,811
I didn't take anything. Command
fell to me and I did my duty.

346
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:01,811
<i>But you were in full command of
Galactica for more than a week...</i>

347
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:05,760
and in that time there were a number
of controversial actions taken.

348
00:21:05,795 --> 00:21:08,006
<i>You're talking about
the Gideon.</i>

349
00:21:09,898 --> 00:21:11,422
I made a military decision.

350
00:21:11,434 --> 00:21:14,403
Given the same circumstances,
I'd do it again.

351
00:21:14,762 --> 00:21:17,162
So you have no regrets,
whatsoever?

352
00:21:27,594 --> 00:21:28,856
You're trying to set me up!

353
00:21:28,873 --> 00:21:31,364
Colonel, why do you think there
was no official investigation...

354
00:21:31,399 --> 00:21:32,930
<i>into the Gideon Massacre?</i>

355
00:21:33,898 --> 00:21:36,025
Please come.
Get out of my face!

356
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:42,461
Did you get that?
Got it.

357
00:21:45,098 --> 00:21:46,929
Someone's a mean drunk.

358
00:21:56,906 --> 00:22:00,199
Great. I could use
a sparring partner.

359
00:22:00,234 --> 00:22:03,492
Sorry. I didn't bring
my gloves. Too bad.

360
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:07,091
Capt. Adama said that I could
ask you about the new pilots.

361
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:10,711
Yeah, well, Capt. Adama
likes to push my buttons.

362
00:22:12,106 --> 00:22:13,095
[Panting]

363
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:18,992
So, what do you look
for in a new recruit?

364
00:22:20,074 --> 00:22:21,063
[Panting]

365
00:22:21,386 --> 00:22:22,683
Coordination.

366
00:22:27,018 --> 00:22:28,485
Good reflexes.

367
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:30,981
Total commitment.

368

[Grunts]

369
00:22:39,338 --> 00:22:44,298
Most of all, someone crazy
enough to follow me into combat.

370
00:22:50,378 --> 00:22:51,777
<i>(D'Anna)
Colonel, why do you think...</i>

371
00:22:51,785 --> 00:22:53,116
<i>there was no

00:22:54,313 --> 00:22:56,474
<i>Please come.
Get out of my face.</i>

374
00:22:59,402 --> 00:23:03,270
I want to apologize for Col. Tigh's
behavior. It was uncalled for.

375
00:23:03,305 --> 00:23:04,543
Seems like a lot of people
have been...

376
00:23:04,554 --> 00:23:07,045
apologizing for him
over the years, Commander.

377
00:23:08,874 --> 00:23:10,569
So level with me.

378
00:23:11,722 --> 00:23:15,317
<i>Why is Col. Tigh not being
charged in the Gideon incident?</i>

379
00:23:17,961 --> 00:23:21,192
We're at war
against an enemy...

380
00:23:21,898 --> 00:23:23,889
with a vastly superior force.

381
00:23:24,042 --> 00:23:28,274
I will not sacrifice the few people we
have left on the altar of public outrage.

382
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:30,262
So four civilians are dead...

383
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,708
and Tigh and the shooters
take a walk.

384
00:23:32,743 --> 00:23:34,377
Nobody takes a walk.

385
00:23:36,201 --> 00:23:37,930
We all gotta live with it.

That is her third wave-off.

When we make a contact...

400

<i>We're gonna do this, okay?</i>

406
00:24:43,561 --> 00:24:47,292

I can't do it.

410
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:56,487
Kat, we did this all through training, okay?
You're gonna stick this, just like before.

You know, I am sick to death of people
like you questioning my patriotism.

I'm here to assure you that
I have no such reservations.

00:30:52,873 --> 00:30:54,983
(D'Anna) Did you ever come
to terms with your dad?

502
00:30:55,018 --> 00:30:59,614
I wouldn't let him. The last
time we talked, it got...

503
00:31:00,522 --> 00:31:01,511
heated.

504
00:31:01,865 --> 00:31:04,698
I told him I never
wanted to see him again.

505
00:31:07,082 --> 00:31:09,414
Three weeks later,
the Cylons attacked.

506
00:31:11,082 --> 00:31:14,313
Okay, so I'm new at this.
Should I be scared?

507
00:31:14,348 --> 00:31:15,477
I am.

508
00:31:20,938 --> 00:31:23,771
All right, people, that's it. Last
bird's away, let's clear the nest.

509
00:31:23,806 --> 00:31:25,478
Get this deck ready
for recovery.

510
00:31:25,513 --> 00:31:27,674
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
Move. Move.

511
00:31:27,709 --> 00:31:29,446
Sir, Alert Vipers are away.

512
00:31:29,481 --> 00:31:31,949
Gun Control reports
weapons manned and ready.

513
00:31:32,585 --> 00:31:34,566
<i>(Apollo)
Apollo, wireless check.</i>

514
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,262
<i>(Starbuck)
Starbuck, I'm hearing you.</i>

515
00:31:36,265 --> 00:31:38,219
<i>(Hotdog) Hotdog
one-four-one, loud and clear.</i>

516
00:31:38,254 --> 00:31:39,956
<i>(Grayshirt)
Grayshirt, loud and clear.</i>

517
00:31:39,991 --> 00:31:41,659
<i>(Kingston)
Kingston, you're good.</i>

518
00:31:43,177 --> 00:31:46,544
<i>Apollo. Tally two Cylon
Raiders, close formation.</i>

519
00:31:46,761 --> 00:31:49,821
<i>This is Starbuck. Roger that.
Roger formation.</i>

520
00:31:49,856 --> 00:31:51,910
<i>(Apollo)
Prepare engage. Weapons hot.</i>

521
00:31:51,945 --> 00:31:55,574
<i>Targets in view. Repeat. Targets
in view. Locked six-four-two-one.</i>

522
00:31:57,418 --> 00:31:58,407
Copy that.

523
00:32:01,161 --> 00:32:04,289
<i>Engaging Cylon Raiders.
Engaging Cylon Raiders.</i>

524
00:32:04,425 --> 00:32:06,893
<i>(Starbuck) They're breaking
formation. Hotdog, stick with me.</i>

525
00:32:06,928 --> 00:32:09,418
<i>(Hotdog) Roger that. Come on, you...</i>

526
00:32:10,858 --> 00:32:12,860
<i>(Hotdog) I've got no joy, I lost visual!</i>

527
00:32:12,895 --> 00:32:14,862
<i>They're throwing me
right on my stick.</i>

528
00:32:14,897 --> 00:32:16,119
<i>Come on, Starbuck.</i>

529
00:32:16,137 --> 00:32:20,130
<i>Hotdog, Raider's on your left
eight. I'm on him. I got him.</i>

530
00:32:20,165 --> 00:32:22,943
<i>Yeah! Splash one!
Targeting second Raider.</i>

531
00:32:24,265 --> 00:32:25,926
<i>(Kingston) Kingston,
Bandit's taking off.</i>

532
00:32:25,929 --> 00:32:27,362
<i>Take evasive action.</i>

533
00:32:27,465 --> 00:32:30,298
<i>(Apollo) I've got him,
Kingston, come on. Come to papa.</i>

534
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:32,905
<i>Damn it, take the shot.</i>

535
00:32:35,497 --> 00:32:37,328
<i>(Apollo) That's a kill. Yes.</i>

536
00:32:37,897 --> 00:32:38,886
Outstanding.

537
00:32:39,081 --> 00:32:41,311
Dradis shows clear, Commander.

538
00:32:44,489 --> 00:32:45,956
This is the Commander.

539
00:32:45,961 --> 00:32:50,159
<i>Cylon Raiders have been intercepted
and destroyed. Good work, people.</i>

540
00:32:50,194 --> 00:32:52,142
<i>(Starbuck)
Roger that, Galactica.</i>

541
00:32:52,177 --> 00:32:54,054
<i>Let's head back
to the bird farm.</i>

542
00:32:54,089 --> 00:32:57,616
Secure from Action Stations.
Set Condition 3.

543
00:32:57,651 --> 00:33:00,410
Mr. Gaeta, you have the deck.

544
00:33:01,001 --> 00:33:02,229
Yes, sir.

545
00:33:09,833 --> 00:33:12,097
Set Condition 3
throughout the ship.

546
00:33:12,132 --> 00:33:13,870
<i>Repeat. Set Condition 3.</i>

547
00:33:14,345 --> 00:33:17,610
Does this ever get
any easier? No, ma'am.

548
00:33:17,833 --> 00:33:19,232
It gets harder.

549
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:26,231
Thank you.

550
00:33:31,594 --> 00:33:33,702
Was 15 degrees?
Sixteen.

551
00:33:33,737 --> 00:33:35,811
So, how'd it go out there?

552
00:33:36,937 --> 00:33:40,395
Well, we didn't lose anyone.
That's a good day.

553
00:33:51,113 --> 00:33:52,375
Ellen?

554
00:34:03,785 --> 00:34:07,186
I'm not sure I've found
a story in all this yet.

555
00:34:11,977 --> 00:34:13,239
Go back a bit.

556
00:34:17,033 --> 00:34:18,466
Yeah. There.

557
00:34:22,953 --> 00:34:24,580
I know that book.

558
00:34:24,809 --> 00:34:26,242
That's by Kataris.

559
00:34:37,961 --> 00:34:40,486
What's wrong, Colonel?
Need a drink?

560
00:34:41,737 --> 00:34:43,204
[Ellen gagging]

561
00:34:48,713 --> 00:34:49,702
[Gags]

562
00:34:51,178 --> 00:34:52,372
You can go to hell.

563
00:34:52,393 --> 00:34:55,885
<i>I've been there.
It was called Gideon.</i>

564
00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:58,795
I can't eat. I can't sleep.

565
00:35:00,137 --> 00:35:01,695
I see their faces.

566
00:35:03,145 --> 00:35:06,308
Those weren't Cylons we
attacked, those were real people.

567
00:35:07,561 --> 00:35:09,529
They looked like my dad.

568
00:35:09,865 --> 00:35:11,969
They looked like
my little brother.

569
00:35:12,004 --> 00:35:14,022
This isn't gonna
change anything.

570
00:35:14,057 --> 00:35:17,652
<i>At least the people on the
Gideon will have their justice.</i>

571
00:35:18,441 --> 00:35:21,308
If that's what this is about,
then do it. I will. I'll do it.

572
00:35:21,343 --> 00:35:24,650
Somebody has to pay for
what happened on that ship.

573
00:35:24,685 --> 00:35:27,957
I was in command, I sent
you there, it's my fault.

574
00:35:33,833 --> 00:35:35,596
Come on, son.

575
00:35:37,258 --> 00:35:38,384
Do it.

576
00:35:48,905 --> 00:35:52,397
<i>Gideon was an accident.
This is a choice.</i>

577
00:35:53,161 --> 00:35:55,129
Colonel.
We're all right here.

578
00:36:02,729 --> 00:36:04,492
Let's go, Lieutenant.

579
00:36:11,881 --> 00:36:13,178
[Ellen crying]

580
00:36:14,345 --> 00:36:16,575
Would you get out
of my face?

581
00:36:22,729 --> 00:36:24,390
What made you do it, Kat?

582
00:36:24,713 --> 00:36:26,044
I was tired.

583
00:36:26,953 --> 00:36:27,942
[Sighs]

584
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:29,501
Haven't gotten any sleep.

585
00:36:29,513 --> 00:36:32,277
I felt like I was losing my edge.
I don't know what else to do.

586
00:36:32,312 --> 00:36:33,700
Couldn't you
talk to someone?

587
00:36:33,737 --> 00:36:36,433
Who am I gonna talk to?
We're all in the same hole.

588
00:36:36,468 --> 00:36:38,893
Okay, there are no
replacements coming up.

589
00:36:38,928 --> 00:36:40,516
There's no down time.
This is it.

590
00:36:42,377 --> 00:36:44,518
So I started taking stims.

591
00:36:44,553 --> 00:36:46,630
<i>(D'Anna) You made a mistake. It happens.</i>

592
00:36:46,665 --> 00:36:49,259
<i>(Kat) Yeah, except now
my flight's a pilot short.</i>

593
00:36:49,294 --> 00:36:51,046
<i>Those guys,
they're just as tired...</i>

594
00:36:51,081 --> 00:36:55,040
<i>and they're just as messed up as I was,
but they're still laying it on the line.</i>

595
00:36:55,849 --> 00:36:59,216
<i>I've worked my ass off
defending this fleet.</i>

596
00:36:59,305 --> 00:37:02,246
<i>I've been frustrated.
I've been angry.</i>

597
00:37:02,281 --> 00:37:05,444
<i>I've been everything that
you can possibly think of.</i>

598
00:37:05,705 --> 00:37:10,074
<i>But this is the first time
that I've felt ashamed.</i>

599
00:37:12,073 --> 00:37:13,335
[Sighing]

600
00:37:13,513 --> 00:37:15,140
I've seen enough.

601
00:37:15,561 --> 00:37:16,550
Kill it.

602
00:37:17,321 --> 00:37:20,404
Look. I understand this might
be hard for you to watch...

603
00:37:20,439 --> 00:37:23,398
It's a hatchet job. The
fleet already thinks we're...

604
00:37:23,433 --> 00:37:26,559
a bunch of trigger-happy
assassins, this just confirms it.

605
00:37:26,594 --> 00:37:29,685
You show us with our pants
down and our asses hanging out.

606
00:37:32,585 --> 00:37:34,553
Don't you have
anything to say?

607
00:37:36,201 --> 00:37:37,793
I think it's great.

608
00:37:38,729 --> 00:37:41,702
I think she did exactly
what we asked her to do.

609
00:37:41,737 --> 00:37:46,731
She put a human face on the
guardians of the fleet. Warts and all.

610
00:37:50,729 --> 00:37:52,356
I'm proud of it.

611
00:37:55,593 --> 00:37:57,652
You can show it
to the entire fleet.

612
00:37:57,687 --> 00:37:59,905
Doesn't get better
than that.

613
00:38:00,073 --> 00:38:01,597
I'd like to see
the end.

614
00:38:01,609 --> 00:38:02,633
So would I.

615
00:38:05,001 --> 00:38:07,765
Go ahead. Yeah.

616
00:38:12,937 --> 00:38:15,667
<i>(D'Anna) I came to
Galactica to tell a story.</i>

617
00:38:16,201 --> 00:38:20,570
<i>In all honesty, I thought I knew what that
story was, before I ever set foot there.</i>

618
00:38:20,617 --> 00:38:24,917
<i>How an arrogant military let their
egos get in the way of doing their jobs.</i>

619
00:38:24,952 --> 00:38:28,070
<i>Safeguarding the lives
of the civilian population.</i>

620
00:38:28,777 --> 00:38:31,974
<i>But I found out that the truth
was more complex than that.</i>

621
00:38:32,201 --> 00:38:34,278
<i>These people aren't Cylons.</i>

622
00:38:34,313 --> 00:38:37,680
<i>They're not robots blindly following
orders and polishing their boots.</i>

623
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:39,073
<i>They're people.</i>

624
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:41,950
<i>Deeply flawed, yes.
But deeply human, too.</i>

625
00:38:41,985 --> 00:38:44,499
<i>And maybe that's saying
the same thing.</i>

626
00:38:47,881 --> 00:38:50,437
<i>What struck me most
is that, despite it all...</i>

627
00:38:50,472 --> 00:38:54,033
<i>the hardships, the stress, the
ever-present danger of being killed.</i>

628
00:38:54,068 --> 00:38:56,678
<i>Despite all that,
they never give up.</i>

629
00:38:56,713 --> 00:38:59,814
<i>They never lie down on the road
and let the truck run them over.</i>

630
00:38:59,849 --> 00:39:03,876
<i>They wake up in the morning, put
on their uniforms and do their jobs.</i>

631
00:39:03,911 --> 00:39:06,086
<i>Everyday. No pay. No rest.</i>

632
00:39:06,121 --> 00:39:10,387
<i>No hope of ever laying down the burden
and letting someone else do the job.</i>

633
00:39:13,097 --> 00:39:15,258
<i>There are no
relief troops coming.</i>

634
00:39:15,497 --> 00:39:18,295
<i>No Colonial fleet training
new recruits every day.</i>

635
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:20,911
<i>The people
on Galactica are it.</i>

636
00:39:21,161 --> 00:39:25,325
<i>They are the thin line of blue
that separates us from the Cylons.</i>

637
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,519
<i>Lt. Gaeta told me
a remarkable statistic.</i>

638
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:32,923
<i>Not a single member of Galactica's
crew has asked to resign. Not one.</i>

639
00:39:33,001 --> 00:39:34,434
<i>Think about that.</i>

640
00:39:35,113 --> 00:39:38,118
<i>If you wore the uniform,
wouldn't you want to quit?</i>

641
00:39:38,153 --> 00:39:41,680
<i>To step aside and say, "Enough. Let
someone else protect the fleet. "</i>

642
00:39:41,715 --> 00:39:42,905
<i>I know I would.</i>

643
00:39:43,497 --> 00:39:45,761
<i>But then,
I don't wear a uniform.</i>

644
00:39:46,281 --> 00:39:49,478
<i>Most of us don't,
and most of us never will.</i>

645
00:40:03,336 --> 00:40:07,636
<i>The story of Galactica isn't that
people make bad decisions under pressure.</i>

646
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:10,258
<i>It's that those mistakes
are the exception.</i>

647
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,319
<i>Most of the time,
the men and women...</i>

648
00:40:12,354 --> 00:40:14,633
<i>serving under Cmdr. Adama
get it right.</i>

649
00:40:14,668 --> 00:40:16,837
<i>The proof is that
our fleet survives.</i>

650
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:20,433
<i>And with Galactica
at our side, we will endure.</i>

651
00:40:20,553 --> 00:40:23,454
<i>This is D' Anna Biers.
Fleet News Service.</i>

652
00:40:23,913 --> 00:40:26,040
That was shown across
their entire fleet.

653
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,378
Their resilience
is remarkable.

654
00:40:30,185 --> 00:40:32,415
Play the footage
that was cut.

655
00:40:33,448 --> 00:40:37,885
<i>(Sharon) What are you doing? Stop it.
(Cottle) I'm trying to save your baby.</i>

656
00:40:39,304 --> 00:40:40,828
<i>(guard)
This is a restricted area!</i>

657
00:40:41,001 --> 00:40:42,730
<i>(Sharon)
Get off of me.</i>

658
00:40:43,209 --> 00:40:46,906
I'm still alive.
She's still alive!

659
00:40:46,941 --> 00:40:48,449
I told you.

660
00:40:49,289 --> 00:40:50,688
That's incredible.

661
00:40:51,369 --> 00:40:52,996
And the baby?

662
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,365
(D'Anna)
It was saved.

663
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:57,749
We lost two Raiders relaying
the images back to the fleet...

664
00:40:57,784 --> 00:40:59,795
but, I think
the sacrifice was worth it.

665
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:01,765
