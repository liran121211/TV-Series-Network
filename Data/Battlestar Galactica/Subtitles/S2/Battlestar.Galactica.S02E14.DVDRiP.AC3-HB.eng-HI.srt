of essential goods,

41

Last week, one of my aides
came down with pneumonia.

44

It's the nature of the beast.
People want what they want.

46
00:03:16,687 --> 00:03:20,475
A few trades would be one thing,
Commander Fisk. That's reality.

47
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:21,886
But I'm talking about criminals

49
00:03:23,487 --> 00:03:27,480
So, bottom line is, I'm implementing a new,
Fleet-wide trade policy.

50
00:03:27,847 --> 00:03:32,682
We need to be in control of our supply chain,

Not much to say. It's widespread, inevitable,

348
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:32,119
and according to President Roslin, illegal.

349
00:25:32,607 --> 00:25:36,043
So it's no surprise that you and Fisk
were in it up to your necks.

350
00:25:36,367 --> 00:25:38,323
Fisk, maybe, but not me.

to Astral Queen in the last 10 days</i>

354
00:25:53,447 --> 00:25:55,563

Why do you think Fisk approached me?

359
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:13,963
To get a piece of your black market scam.
To offer you protection.

360
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:18,638
You and your father are both
so blinded by the past.

361
00:26:21,167 --> 00:26:24,716
Fisk's black market was up and running
when he approached me.

362
00:26:25,967 --> 00:26:28,606
He knew Adama would pick up
on his unauthorised shuttles,

363
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:31,838
so he tried to force me
into taking over the deliveries,

364
00:26:31,927 --> 00:26:35,681
<i>creating a firewall between Pegasus
and the illegal shipments.</i>

365
00:26:36,807 --> 00:26:39,640
So you're trying to tell me
that you turned him down?

366
00:26:40,327 --> 00:26:41,601
At great cost.

367
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:44,159

at the Astral Queen after Fisk's last trip.</i>

369
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:49,522
The answer is none.

370
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:51,916
So if Fisk was trying to starve you out,

371
00:26:52,247 --> 00:26:54,397
why didn't you bring it to the Quorum?

372
00:26:55,287 --> 00:26:59,121
Roslin's acting like the black market's
some sort of aberration,

373
00:26:59,447 --> 00:27:01,722

Zero...

522
00:40:25,207 --> 00:40:26,481
Well? No?

523
00:40:28,527 --> 00:40:30,882
President wasn't very happy today.

524
00:40:31,207 --> 00:40:32,322
No.

525
00:40:37,007 --> 00:40:40,602
Ever since you ejected from the Blackbird,
you've been different.

526
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:44,720
Harder to reach.

527
00:40:46,247 --> 00:40:48,636
I'm just trying to understand.

528
00:40:51,007 --> 00:40:55,205
Well, like you said, Dad,
we've all been through a lot.

529
00:40:57,527 --> 00:40:58,721
Fair enough.

530
00:41:01,047 --> 00:41:03,481
But you should have told me
about the woman.
