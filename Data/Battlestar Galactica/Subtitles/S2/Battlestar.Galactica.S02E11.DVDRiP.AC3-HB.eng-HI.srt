00:00:25,996 --> 00:00:26,969
<i>Please respond.</i>

6
00:00:28,185 --> 00:00:30,449
How can that be? The

8
00:00:34,873 --> 00:00:37,967
<i>On behalf of the officers

9
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:40,475
welcome back
to the Colonial Fleet.

10
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:43,382
The Cylon fleet is composed
of two base ships,

11
00:00:43,417 --> 00:00:47,285
about a dozen or so support
ships and one large vessel

12
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,684
that we are still
unable to identify.

13
00:00:49,817 --> 00:00:52,581
It's this large ship here
that I'm interested in.

14
00:00:52,616 --> 00:00:54,870
I'm going to integrate
the crews.

15
00:00:54,905 --> 00:00:58,898
I thought you said you had no
desire to interfere with my command.

16
00:01:01,721 --> 00:01:03,596
<i>I'm Laird, Pegasus Deck Chief.</i>

17
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:05,472
You're an
aeronautical engineer?

18
00:01:05,507 --> 00:01:06,557
Yeah, I was.

19
00:01:06,585 --> 00:01:08,416
So you're really a civilian?

20
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:11,968
<i>I was on the Scylla and we
got picked up by the Pegasus.</i>

22
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:15,798
How much time do I have?

23
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:18,165
Weeks, a month at the outside.

24
00:01:21,465 --> 00:01:23,160
Will I be able to work?

25
00:01:23,545 --> 00:01:25,775
Unless the cancer goes to your
brain. If that happens, you...

26
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:29,366
CAIN: We have
our own Cylon prisoner.

27
00:01:29,401 --> 00:01:32,529
NO. 6: She's obviously been
abused. Tortured.

28
00:01:32,564 --> 00:01:34,031
Will you help her, Gaius?

29
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:36,854
You really want to get close,

30
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:39,830

31

Starbuck,
you're off this mission.

33
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,894
A surveillance package?

34
00:01:47,929 --> 00:01:51,490
Go get the Blackbird, take some
pretty pictures of our Cylon ship.

35
00:01:51,673 --> 00:01:52,833
Who the hell's this Thorne?

36
00:01:52,857 --> 00:01:54,222
GAGE: Lt. Thorne, sir.

37
00:01:54,233 --> 00:01:56,133
Your little robot girl
is in for quite a ride.

38
00:01:57,945 --> 00:01:59,913
TYROL: Get off her!

00:02:02,809 --> 00:02:05,334
...either of you

40
00:02:06,777 --> 00:02:09,110
They've been found guilty
on all counts.

41
00:02:09,145 --> 00:02:11,409
She's going to execute them
both for murder and treason.

45
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:23,037

No transponders,
no recognition codes,

91

it has to be
a Cylon Raider, sir.

92
00:06:43,385 --> 00:06:45,366
Admiral, sir,
she's gotta be a Raider.

93
00:06:45,401 --> 00:06:48,598
Well, how the frak did it get in
so close without being detected?

94
00:06:48,633 --> 00:06:50,937
I don't know, sir. I assure

106
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:28,933
Starbuck to all Vipers,
do not fire.

107
00:07:28,968 --> 00:07:31,124
Repeat, do not fire.

108
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,281
I'm a friendly, okay?

109
00:07:33,305 --> 00:07:35,102
We're all friendlies,

110
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:37,885
so let's just be friendly.

111
00:07:39,321 --> 00:07:42,188
That's no Raider, that's that
stealth ship of yours.

112
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,385
It was flying and it wasn't
cleared to launch.

113
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:48,841
You got me. I'm just
a passenger back here.

114
00:07:50,104 --> 00:07:53,198
<i>Galactica, Kat.
It's the Blackbird, Galactica.</i>

<i>KAT: Repeat,

116
00:07:55,481 --> 00:07:57,278
What the hell is the
Blackbird doing out there?

117
00:07:57,313 --> 00:07:58,398
<i>HOTDOG:
All pilots hold fire.</i>

118
00:07:58,424 --> 00:08:01,018
It's Starbuck. She launched in
the Blackbird a couple hours ago,

119
00:08:01,053 --> 00:08:03,283
said she was running
flight tests for Adm. Cain.

120
00:08:03,318 --> 00:08:04,918
That doesn't sound likely.

121
00:08:04,921 --> 00:08:07,583
Another one of her
crazy-assed stunts.

122
00:08:07,618 --> 00:08:08,807
Thank the gods!

123
00:08:08,825 --> 00:08:11,453
<i>You can say that again.
Get me Pegasus.</i>

124
00:08:16,216 --> 00:08:18,549
<i>This is Pegasus Actual,

125
00:08:18,584 --> 00:08:22,645
We can either stand-down or we
could start shooting at each other.

126
00:08:22,809 --> 00:08:24,333
It's your call.

127
00:08:24,344 --> 00:08:25,333
Admiral.

128
00:08:27,544 --> 00:08:28,772
Wait one.

129
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,828
We're receiving a download,
Admiral.

130
00:08:37,465 --> 00:08:39,433
That is the Cylon fleet.

131
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,872
Are these from our
recon mission?

132
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:44,512
No, sir. The recon mission
was aborted.

133
00:08:44,547 --> 00:08:45,835
These are from Blackbird.

134
00:08:48,537 --> 00:08:49,765
Thrace.

135
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,717
She took off and did the
whole recon mission alone.

136
00:08:54,585 --> 00:08:57,383
My gods,
look at these shots, Jack.

137
00:08:58,489 --> 00:09:01,947
She put her nose right up their
backsides, and they never even knew it.

138
00:09:01,982 --> 00:09:04,459
Admiral, I still have
Commander Adama on the line,

139
00:09:04,494 --> 00:09:06,936
and our fighters are still
requesting instructions.

140
00:09:06,971 --> 00:09:08,371
Should they resume the attack?

141
00:09:20,473 --> 00:09:22,441
All right. Joint recall.

142
00:09:23,353 --> 00:09:26,049
Both ships stand-down
to Condition Two.

143
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:29,462
Then I want you to report
to me directly. In person.

144
00:09:29,657 --> 00:09:32,717
I have no intention of
cooling my heels in your brig.

145
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:37,213
Fine.

146
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,956
Neutral ground.
Colonial One, no aides.

147
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:43,282
Be there in 15 minutes.

148
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:47,760
Stand-down, Condition Two.

149
00:09:59,577 --> 00:10:01,067
There you are.

150
00:10:59,064 --> 00:11:01,653
ROSLIN: Let's start this
by admitting an ugly truth.

151
00:11:01,688 --> 00:11:05,180
What happened out there today was
the result of failure in leadership

152
00:11:05,215 --> 00:11:07,094
of everyone in this room.

153
00:11:07,129 --> 00:11:09,256
We are the leaders
of this fleet.

154
00:11:09,272 --> 00:11:11,382
As such, we need
to set an example.

155
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:14,163
We cannot continue to let
the conflicts between us...

156
00:11:14,198 --> 00:11:16,910
Oh, let's cut through
the hand-holding, shall we?

157
00:11:16,945 --> 00:11:19,723
Two of his men murdered
one of my officers

158
00:11:19,758 --> 00:11:21,654
while protecting a Cylon.

159
00:11:21,689 --> 00:11:23,680
They're guilty.
They admitted it.

160
00:11:24,057 --> 00:11:27,083
And under regulations
I have complete authority

161
00:11:27,118 --> 00:11:28,796
to try, convict
and sentence them.

162
00:11:29,784 --> 00:11:33,743
And you and I both know that the
penalty for that crime is death.

163
00:11:34,873 --> 00:11:37,814
Admiral, surely
the spirit of the law

164
00:11:37,849 --> 00:11:41,216
requires something more here
than summary executions.

165
00:11:45,144 --> 00:11:48,807
Is this what the two of you have
been doing for the past six months?

166
00:11:49,432 --> 00:11:53,198
Debating the finer points of
Colonial law? Well, guess what?

167
00:11:53,233 --> 00:11:54,774
We're at war.

168
00:11:55,576 --> 00:11:59,342
And we don't have the luxury of
academic debate over these issues.

169
00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:01,579
You want to cut through it,
fine.

170
00:12:04,184 --> 00:12:06,812
<i>You have Pegasus,
he has Galactica.</i>

171
00:12:07,513 --> 00:12:10,421
Two heavily armed,
very powerful warships.

172
00:12:10,456 --> 00:12:13,584
<i>Now, I am sure that Pegasus
would prevail in any fight.</i>

173
00:12:13,619 --> 00:12:15,463
I wouldn't count on that.

174
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:20,463
ROSLIN: But certainly
there'd be heavy damage,

175
00:12:20,498 --> 00:12:22,934
and you'd take
significant casualties.

176
00:12:22,969 --> 00:12:26,496
<i>So you can go out there and
fight it out with Galactica,</i>

177
00:12:26,531 --> 00:12:28,221
or you can compromise.

178
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:32,081
And those are the only two
options on the table, period.

179
00:12:37,113 --> 00:12:40,913
How the two of you have survived
this long, I will never know.

180
00:12:42,904 --> 00:12:47,307
All right. Lt. Thrace has sent
me detailed recon information

181
00:12:47,342 --> 00:12:49,621
on the Cylon fleet.
I want that fleet.

182
00:12:49,656 --> 00:12:52,591
<i>And I need Galactica to get it.
So I'm willing to go this far.</i>

183
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,358
I'll suspend the executions
until after the attack.

184
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:58,069
<i>I want them back on Galactica.</i>

185
00:12:58,072 --> 00:13:00,341
I don't give a damn
what you want.

186
00:13:00,376 --> 00:13:03,243
You're frakking lucky you're
not staring at your own warrant.

187
00:13:15,384 --> 00:13:18,581
The destruction of the Cylon
fleet will take priority

188
00:13:18,616 --> 00:13:20,629
over all other considerations.

189
00:13:20,664 --> 00:13:24,600
After that, we will meet back here
and we will resolve this issue.

190
00:13:24,635 --> 00:13:25,732
Thank you.

191
00:13:54,777 --> 00:13:56,745
Stand at ease, Lieutenant,
and come forward.

192
00:14:04,696 --> 00:14:06,994
It seems you've had
quite a day.

193
00:14:08,184 --> 00:14:09,811
I'm promoting you to Captain.

194
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:11,716
<i>I'm making you Commander
of the Pegasus Air Group.</i>

195
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:14,907
You're promoting me?

196
00:14:16,153 --> 00:14:18,517
I need a CAG with guts
and initiative

197
00:14:18,552 --> 00:14:20,417
to plan and lead
the attack on this fleet.

198
00:14:21,816 --> 00:14:23,829
Now, I thought
Stinger was that man,

199
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:25,909
but he managed to let
Capt. Adama contact you

200
00:14:25,944 --> 00:14:28,105
and pull off that fly-by stunt
right under his nose,

201
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,521
so he's out.

202
00:14:30,712 --> 00:14:32,612
And Capt. Adama, sir?

203
00:14:34,552 --> 00:14:38,283
Truth be told, I came this close
to throwing him in the brig,

204
00:14:38,968 --> 00:14:40,993
but I couldn't exactly
charge him and not you,

205
00:14:41,028 --> 00:14:43,646
so I've just revoked
his flight status.

206
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,093
I want him on my team, sir.

207
00:15:00,216 --> 00:15:02,343
And do you always
get what you want?

208
00:15:04,184 --> 00:15:06,516
Most of the time, sir.

209
00:15:07,352 --> 00:15:08,444
Good.

210
00:15:10,424 --> 00:15:11,618
Me, too.

211
00:15:16,952 --> 00:15:18,283
All right, you can have him.

212
00:15:19,896 --> 00:15:22,421
I hear you want to return
to Caprica.

213
00:15:22,776 --> 00:15:24,107
Yes, sir.

214
00:15:24,984 --> 00:15:27,029
We have people
back there still alive.

215
00:15:27,064 --> 00:15:29,897
Yes, and they deserve to be
saved. I absolutely agree.

216
00:15:29,932 --> 00:15:32,282
In fact, I will go
one step further

217
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:35,328
and I will say
that our ultimate goal

218
00:15:37,464 --> 00:15:39,125
is that we should return
to the 12 Colonies

219
00:15:39,128 --> 00:15:41,221
and kick the Cylons
the frak out of our homes.

220
00:15:43,672 --> 00:15:45,572
What do you think
of that, Captain?

221
00:15:46,424 --> 00:15:49,791
I think that's the best idea
I've heard all day, sir.

222
00:15:55,192 --> 00:15:57,285
I'm afraid this can only
end one way.

223
00:16:00,024 --> 00:16:01,252
You've gotta kill her.

224
00:16:07,608 --> 00:16:09,768
What the hell
are you talking about?

225
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:11,928
Like she said,
let's cut through it.

226
00:16:11,963 --> 00:16:13,685
The two of you

227
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,381
were willing to go
to war today.

228
00:16:15,384 --> 00:16:17,750
Do you think she's going
to step down from that?

229
00:16:17,785 --> 00:16:19,312
She's gonna bide her time

230
00:16:19,992 --> 00:16:22,392
and hit you the first chance
she gets. That's a given.

231
00:16:24,536 --> 00:16:27,605
I hate to lay this on you,
Bill, but she is dangerous,

232
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,871
and the only thing that you can do
is to hit her before she hits you.

233
00:16:33,176 --> 00:16:34,837
I'm not an assassin.

234
00:16:37,432 --> 00:16:38,456
No.

235
00:16:39,864 --> 00:16:42,992
You're not an assassin.
You are a Colonial officer

236
00:16:43,027 --> 00:16:45,837
who has taken an oath
to protect this fleet.

237
00:16:46,712 --> 00:16:50,148
What do you think that she is
going to do with the civilian fleet

238
00:16:50,183 --> 00:16:51,835
once she has eliminated you?

239
00:16:55,256 --> 00:16:56,450
You know I'm right.

240
00:16:58,296 --> 00:16:59,558
You just don't wanna face it.

241
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,555

electrolyte levels are stable.

You do have a cracked rib,
though,

245
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,466
a hairline fracture, which means
it's gonna hurt like hell for a while.

246
00:17:35,864 --> 00:17:39,061
But I'm not seeing any signs of
permanent damage from the attack.

247
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:47,127
The attack. Is that what
we're calling it now?

248
00:17:47,512 --> 00:17:49,207
<i>They were not
from the Galactica.</i>

249
00:17:54,296 --> 00:17:57,459
<i>They were from the Pegasus.
So what?</i>

250
00:18:00,632 --> 00:18:02,122
What about Helo and the Chief?

251
00:18:03,864 --> 00:18:05,832
I heard a rumor
they're gonna be executed.

252
00:18:08,984 --> 00:18:10,417
I'm not gonna
let that happen.

253
00:18:11,448 --> 00:18:12,745
Well,
how're you gonna do that?

254
00:18:13,272 --> 00:18:15,502
Isn't Adm. Cain in command?

255
00:18:17,688 --> 00:18:19,053
What happened to you...

256
00:18:19,096 --> 00:18:20,723
COTTLE: Was unforgivable.

257
00:18:24,216 --> 00:18:26,844
...happened aboard my ship,
on my watch,

258
00:18:27,032 --> 00:18:28,624
and it's my responsibility.

259
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:34,035
So I just want you to know
that I personally apologize.

00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:17,677
about a week after the attack.

344
00:25:22,615 --> 00:25:23,809
They were good ships.

345
00:25:24,504 --> 00:25:26,836
FTL drives and weapons, even.

346
00:25:27,736 --> 00:25:31,570
<i>A lot of potential spare parts
that we could use on Pegasus.</i>

347
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:36,093
So the Admiral
made a decision.

348
00:25:37,719 --> 00:25:41,155
Military needs are a priority.

349
00:25:43,831 --> 00:25:45,389
You stripped them.

350
00:25:45,399 --> 00:25:47,731
You stripped the ships
for parts.

351
00:25:50,103 --> 00:25:52,071
Sweet mother of Artemis.

352
00:25:54,487 --> 00:25:56,079
How much equipment
did you take?

353
00:25:58,808 --> 00:25:59,968
You take their jump drives?

354
00:26:04,151 --> 00:26:06,176
Left all those people
marooned out there?

355
00:26:06,211 --> 00:26:07,191
No, not all.

356
00:26:10,295 --> 00:26:14,561
Adm. Cain looked over the passenger
list and she made a decision

357
00:26:14,596 --> 00:26:17,856
about who was valuable
and who wasn't.

358
00:26:25,367 --> 00:26:27,335
<i>Scylla was the toughest.</i>

359
00:26:28,183 --> 00:26:30,515
Laird and 15
other men and women.

360
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,080
They were all...

361
00:26:32,343 --> 00:26:34,743
All traveling
with their families,

362
00:26:34,778 --> 00:26:36,872
wives, husbands, children.

363
00:26:37,143 --> 00:26:38,804
The selectees

364
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,541
refused to go.
There was resistance.

365
00:26:44,248 --> 00:26:46,273
So, the order came down

366
00:26:47,991 --> 00:26:52,485
to shoot the family
of anyone who refused to come.

367
00:26:55,096 --> 00:26:56,427
So we did.

368
00:26:57,943 --> 00:27:01,572
Two families. We put them
up against the bulkhead

369
00:27:03,927 --> 00:27:05,554
and we shot them.

370
00:27:18,967 --> 00:27:21,162
The CAG's work is never done.

371
00:27:22,775 --> 00:27:24,572
Hi. How're you doing?

372
00:27:26,647 --> 00:27:29,275
Oh, you mean
apart from being demoted,

373
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,621
finding myself working
for one of my pilots?

374
00:27:34,712 --> 00:27:36,475
Great. Never better.

375
00:27:39,543 --> 00:27:42,034
You know I had nothing
to do with that, right?

376
00:27:42,069 --> 00:27:43,201
Never thought you did.

377
00:27:50,167 --> 00:27:52,658
I just checked in
on Helo and Tyrol.

378
00:27:53,975 --> 00:27:55,203
They're hanging tight for now.

379
00:27:56,055 --> 00:27:57,147
Good.

380
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,308
Help me plan this op.

381
00:28:01,719 --> 00:28:03,482
I've been staring
at this roster...

382
00:28:05,944 --> 00:28:09,004
Do you want to just carry on
as if nothing's happened?

383
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,782
Lee, she's in command.
What do you wanna do?

384
00:28:11,704 --> 00:28:13,797
There's nothing we can do.

385
00:28:16,791 --> 00:28:19,021
I thought you might like
a fresh set of clothes.

386
00:29:06,743 --> 00:29:10,702
Were you aware of your true nature
as a Cylon when you boarded the ship

387
00:29:11,543 --> 00:29:14,740
or would you describe
yourself as a sleeper agent?

388
00:29:18,007 --> 00:29:19,668
I knew what I was.

389
00:29:21,399 --> 00:29:24,562
I was a soldier. I had a
mission, I carried it out.

390
00:29:27,255 --> 00:29:29,519
I thought that when it was
done, I was going to die.

391
00:29:30,487 --> 00:29:32,216
That you would kill me.

392
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:37,717
Then I... Then I would
download into a new body.

393
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:40,010
Be reborn.

394
00:29:40,567 --> 00:29:42,467
But you didn't kill me.

395
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,108
The things you did to me...

396
00:29:45,143 --> 00:29:48,476
What they did to you
was wrong, evil.

397
00:29:49,751 --> 00:29:51,048
But I'm not one of them.

398
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:54,181
You have to believe me.

399
00:29:56,215 --> 00:30:00,049
Things are going to get better
for you from this moment on.

400
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,731
I promise.

401
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:05,774
I don't want things
to get better. I want to die.

402
00:30:07,735 --> 00:30:09,828
But you know you can't die.

403
00:30:10,807 --> 00:30:12,104
You do know that, don't you?

404
00:30:13,783 --> 00:30:17,412
Your consciousness will merely transfer,
and you'll wake up in another body.

405
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:20,009
Not if you destroy that.

406
00:30:22,551 --> 00:30:23,848
What, this?

407
00:30:25,879 --> 00:30:28,814
This ship? Tell me,

408
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:35,732
what's so important
about this ship?

409
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,836
The Cylons call this
their Resurrection ship.

410
00:30:42,871 --> 00:30:45,601
At the moment, we are too far
away from the Cylon home world

411
00:30:45,636 --> 00:30:47,221
for the normal
downloading process to work.

412
00:30:47,224 --> 00:30:49,624
Which is why
they built this ship.

413
00:30:49,752 --> 00:30:53,688
It contains the entire apparatus
necessary for Cylon resurrection.

414
00:30:54,327 --> 00:30:56,590
Now, this ship has been
traveling with the fleet,

415
00:30:56,625 --> 00:30:58,853
<i>trailing Galactica
for the last several months.</i>

416
00:30:59,895 --> 00:31:01,021
So it's a safety net.

417
00:31:01,687 --> 00:31:03,655
A place where they fall
back to when they die.

418
00:31:04,504 --> 00:31:06,335
And if they lose
their safety net...

419
00:31:08,151 --> 00:31:10,813
Then any Cylon
who dies out here...

420
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,265
Would be dead.

421
00:31:14,008 --> 00:31:16,033
As in, really dead.

422
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:20,711
And I dare say
they won't like that.

423
00:31:21,239 --> 00:31:22,467
No, sir.

424
00:31:23,543 --> 00:31:25,067
They might even
stop chasing us.

425
00:31:25,847 --> 00:31:28,577
Why risk getting killed if you
can't just wake up all nice and cozy

426
00:31:28,612 --> 00:31:29,832
in a brand-new body?

427
00:31:32,631 --> 00:31:34,326
Doctor, I think
you've just identified

428
00:31:34,327 --> 00:31:35,988
the most important ship
in the galaxy.

429
00:31:46,199 --> 00:31:49,635
I have good days and bad days,
but don't look so worried,

430
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:51,322
I'm not dying today.

431
00:31:53,112 --> 00:31:54,739
I wasn't worried.

432
00:31:56,215 --> 00:31:58,080
What can I do for you?

433
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,505
You were right about Cain.

434
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:05,774
<i>Pegasus had a civilian fleet
with her.</i>

435
00:32:06,455 --> 00:32:07,945
Fifteen ships.

436
00:32:10,263 --> 00:32:14,359
Cain stripped them
for parts, supplies,

437
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:16,961
people.

438
00:32:19,031 --> 00:32:22,489
I wish I could say I was
surprised, but it's who she is.

439
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:25,207
She's playing for keeps.
You gotta do the same.

440
00:32:26,008 --> 00:32:27,703
What's gotten into you?

441
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:28,692
What?

442
00:32:29,527 --> 00:32:31,757
You've become
so bloody-minded.

443
00:32:33,271 --> 00:32:35,831
I know that as long
as Cain lives,

444
00:32:36,823 --> 00:32:39,155
your survival is at risk.
I know that.

445
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,458
(COUGHING)

446
00:32:56,919 --> 00:32:58,648
What can I get you?

447
00:33:00,023 --> 00:33:01,388
A new body.

448
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:06,962
Perhaps one of those
young Cylon models

449
00:33:06,997 --> 00:33:08,996
from the Resurrection ship?

450
00:33:09,367 --> 00:33:11,494
I can't see you as a blonde.

451
00:33:13,143 --> 00:33:14,974
You'd be surprised.

452
00:33:23,287 --> 00:33:24,584
I'll see you tomorrow?

453
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:25,691
Mmm-hmm.

454
00:33:35,575 --> 00:33:36,906
Commander,

455
00:33:38,647 --> 00:33:40,877
she won't hesitate
to kill you.

456
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:43,508
Don't let her.

457
00:34:03,127 --> 00:34:05,459
You know,
when we get out of here,

458
00:34:06,647 --> 00:34:08,774
I'm gonna make some changes.

459
00:34:10,871 --> 00:34:11,963
Yeah?

460
00:34:12,343 --> 00:34:13,674
Like what?

461
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:16,585
Me and Sharon.

462
00:34:19,831 --> 00:34:21,162
It's done.

463
00:34:25,591 --> 00:34:28,424
I mean, really done.
I can't do it anymore.

464
00:34:29,527 --> 00:34:31,427
I mean, don't get me wrong.

465
00:34:31,511 --> 00:34:33,274
LT, what we did,

466
00:34:34,455 --> 00:34:37,549
I would do again
in a heartbeat.

467
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:42,260
I gotta let it go.

468
00:34:44,279 --> 00:34:46,372
I so thought I'd let go.

469
00:34:46,615 --> 00:34:47,707
Yeah,

470
00:34:48,855 --> 00:34:50,652
I know what you mean.

471
00:34:52,087 --> 00:34:53,145
You?

472
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:54,661
Yeah, me.

473
00:34:55,575 --> 00:34:59,409
What, you think I don't have
second thoughts sometimes?

474
00:35:01,174 --> 00:35:04,701
You think I don't wonder if
I'm losing my frakking mind?

475
00:35:04,983 --> 00:35:07,975
I'm in love with a woman
I know isn't a woman.

476
00:35:11,767 --> 00:35:13,860
I'm having a baby that's...

477
00:35:14,231 --> 00:35:17,564
That's what, half machine?

478
00:35:26,327 --> 00:35:28,693
You really do love her,
don't you?

479
00:35:28,728 --> 00:35:29,754
Yeah.

480
00:35:31,287 --> 00:35:32,618
Yes, I do.

481
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:36,958
And I can't let go of it.

482
00:35:40,087 --> 00:35:43,614
But if you can, let her go.

483
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:45,975
Our primary objective is a vessel
named Resurrection by the Cylons.

484
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:47,506
It's guarded by
two Base Stars,

485
00:36:47,511 --> 00:36:49,979
which have been following us
throughout this sector.

486
00:36:50,014 --> 00:36:53,242
Our plan, simply put,
is to let them find us.

487
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:56,308
We will wait
in this system here,

488
00:36:56,343 --> 00:36:58,644
and appear to be conducting
mining operations.

489
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:00,946
STARBUCK: When the Cylons
launch their Raiders,

490
00:37:00,951 --> 00:37:03,495
<i>Galactica and most of the
civilians will jump away.</i>

491
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:05,883
A small group of civilians
will be left behind.

492
00:37:05,918 --> 00:37:08,180
To the Cylons, they'll
appear to be having trouble

493
00:37:08,215 --> 00:37:12,174
with their FTL drives and attempting
to escape at sub-light speed.

494
00:37:12,342 --> 00:37:15,243
The Cylon Raiders
pursue the civilian decoys,

495
00:37:15,574 --> 00:37:19,135
pulling the Raiders farther away
from the Cylon Base Stars as they can.

496
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:22,122
APOLLO: Once the Raiders have
been drawn off by the decoys,

497
00:37:22,327 --> 00:37:26,423
<i>Galactica and Pegasus will jump
in and attack the Base Stars,</i>

498
00:37:27,735 --> 00:37:31,694
while I jump in in the
Blackbird stealth fighter

499
00:37:31,729 --> 00:37:33,427
and take out the FTL drives

500
00:37:33,462 --> 00:37:35,930
on the Resurrection ship,
preventing it from jumping away.

501
00:37:36,023 --> 00:37:39,720
Why not have the stealth ship carry
nukes and destroy it right at the start?

502
00:37:39,755 --> 00:37:42,938
We ran simulations on that. We
determined that the Cylons would detect

503
00:37:42,973 --> 00:37:44,930
the nuclear warheads
and destroy the stealth ship

504
00:37:44,965 --> 00:37:47,353
before it got
within weapons range.

505
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:52,065
<i>When the FTL is destroyed,
Galactica and Pegasus</i>

506
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,684
will take on the Base Stars,

507
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:57,211
and our attack squadrons will go
after the Resurrection ship itself.

508
00:37:57,622 --> 00:37:59,317
How many squadrons?

509
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:02,263
All of them.

510
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:15,657
Is there a problem,
Commander?

511
00:38:17,591 --> 00:38:20,685
I need time to study
the operational details.

512
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:25,699
Suit yourself. I've gone over
the details and I'm satisfied.

513
00:38:26,391 --> 00:38:30,452
I want your CAG to stay and help
me answer some of my questions.

514
00:38:32,438 --> 00:38:34,030
One hour, Thrace.

515
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:35,301
Yes, sir.

516
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:44,180
Stay focused, son.

517
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:04,915
<i>Jack, I want to transfer a
detachment of Marines to Galactica.</i>

518
00:39:06,038 --> 00:39:08,336
And I want you
to hand-pick them.

519
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:13,545
Completely reliable.
Completely loyal.

520
00:39:14,999 --> 00:39:15,988
Razors.

521
00:39:16,759 --> 00:39:18,989
I have a mission for you,
Kara.

522
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:21,072
Anything for you.
You know that.

523
00:39:22,263 --> 00:39:24,254
Don't accept too quickly.

524
00:39:25,078 --> 00:39:26,545
You won't like this one.

525
00:39:28,695 --> 00:39:29,719
I don't like it.

526
00:39:31,511 --> 00:39:34,207
But I've decided
that it has to be done.

527
00:39:34,838 --> 00:39:36,931
<i>I'm transferring you
to Galactica as well.</i>

528
00:39:38,326 --> 00:39:41,727
I'll tell Adama that you're
there to be my eyes and ears.

529
00:39:42,327 --> 00:39:45,428
He'll hate it,
he'll think you're my spy

530
00:39:45,463 --> 00:39:47,761
and try to freeze you out
of decision-making,

531
00:39:48,759 --> 00:39:50,420
but he'll accept it.

532
00:39:50,711 --> 00:39:54,203
Now, I want you to stay
in CIC throughout the attack.

533
00:39:54,238 --> 00:39:56,436
Stay with Adama.

534
00:39:56,471 --> 00:39:58,905
ADAMA: After the attack
is completed,

535
00:39:59,286 --> 00:40:01,846
and you've accounted
for your pilots,

536
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:05,600
<i>I want you to land your bird
on the Pegasus to report</i>

537
00:40:05,635 --> 00:40:07,150
directly to CIC.

538
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:11,198
You'll take Lee with you.

539
00:40:11,543 --> 00:40:13,033
He'll watch your back.

540
00:40:13,047 --> 00:40:16,141
Position Marines in key areas
throughout the ship and keep a squad

541
00:40:16,176 --> 00:40:17,972
posted just outside CIC.

542
00:40:18,007 --> 00:40:21,120
Now, there will be the normal chaos
and emotional high after the attack.

543
00:40:21,155 --> 00:40:24,234
They'll be slapping each other on
the back, celebrating the victory.

544
00:40:24,269 --> 00:40:25,207
That'll keep their guard down.

545
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:27,036
Security will be lax.

546
00:40:29,687 --> 00:40:32,622
I will ask for you
over the wireless.

547
00:40:32,886 --> 00:40:36,046
I will call you directly. And
when I have you on the line

548
00:40:36,081 --> 00:40:39,207
and you hear me give the
command "Execute case orange"...

549
00:40:39,383 --> 00:40:41,317
When you hear me
say "Downfall"...

550
00:40:43,735 --> 00:40:47,637
...you are to signal the Marines
to terminate Adama's command.

551
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:51,577
Start it with Adama.

552
00:40:53,654 --> 00:40:55,679
...I want you
to pull out your weapon

553
00:40:57,175 --> 00:40:59,609
and shoot Adm. Cain
in the head.
