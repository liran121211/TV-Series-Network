and you know what it gets you?

178
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,395
Exactly nothing.

179
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,153
Are you sure you're a priest?

180
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,077
I've been preaching longer than
you've been sucking down oxygen.

181
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,831
And in that time,
I've learned enough to know

182
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,310
that the Gods don't answer prayers.

183
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,110
We're here on our own.
That's the way they set things up.

184
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,193
We have to find our own answers,
our own way out of the wilderness

185
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,353
without a nice little sunny path all laid out
in front of us in advance.

186
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,919
That's what I'm trying to do.

187
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,558
I'm trying to find my way.

188
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,914
Now, it's not gonna get better

189
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,433
until you see what the problem is.

190
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:49,559
And the problem is you are screwed up,
heart and mind.

191
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,232
You, not the Gods or fate or the universe.

192
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,549
You.

193
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,993
Thanks for the pep talk.

194
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,995
Hey.

195
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,075
Hi.

196
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,631
I just wanted to say,

197
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,799
well,

198
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,635
good hunting.

199
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,233
Thank you, sir.

200
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,119
Yeah, it's a good plan.

201
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,159
It's a good plan.

202
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,511
Sharon should be able to jump you
into the atmosphere

203
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,750
a couple of clicks above the surface.

204
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,196
Down below the Cylon dradis.
I know the plan.

205
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,474
Lee, I wrote it.

206
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,475
Yeah.

207
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,358
I gotta go.

208
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,319
I hope you find him, Kara.

209
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,274
I really do.

210
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,269
So do I.

211
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,194
From the Colonial dispatch,

212
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,952
"Last night's debate only solidified
the perception...

213
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,314
- MAN: Madam President.
- I'll do that later.

214
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,676
"...that Doctor Baltar, for all his charm,
is essentially an empty suit

215
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,910
"when it comes to matters
of substantive policy."

216
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,556
It's nice to see the press
is getting it right for a change.

217
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,154
Don't forget, the radical religious charge
is dangerous.

218
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,037
It may be a low blow from a desperate man,

219
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,634
but it's the only issue
he's managed to get any traction on.

220
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,039
He will keep exploiting it.

221
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,475
He's gotta come up with something much,
much bigger than that

222
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,790
if he wants to make it the central issue
of his campaign.

223
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,835
It's not gonna work.

224
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,715
(SIGHING)

225
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,109
You gotta keep hitting her
on the religious thing.

226
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,916
Every time we go there,

227
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,514
you score points,
and we move the polls in our direction.

228
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,636
Yes, I'm not sure if you're aware, Tom,

229
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,437
but the mob isn't usually in the habit
of electing ungodly apostates

230
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,556
who denigrate people of faith.

231
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,074
Things are gonna turn around. You'll see.

232
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,275
He's right.

233
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,439
Listen to him.

234
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,269
Of course.

235
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,037
Of course. How blind I'm being.
Thank you, yes.

236
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,951
"Things are gonna turn around. You'll see."

237
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,268
What is that? Advice?

238
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,634
Well, thank you.
Thank you for your keen insight,

239
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,312
your astounding political acumen.

240
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,595
You know, I'm so assured right now, Tom,

241
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,194
I'm just gonna sit right back
and wait for the hand of God

242
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,350
to reach down and change
my political fortunes.

243
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,475
How about that?

244
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,759
Galactica, <i>Starbuck.</i>

245
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,957
SAR squadron confirms readiness check,
and we are spun up out here

246
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,439
and ready for the first jump.

247
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,794
DUALLA: <i>You are go for the jump, Starbuck.</i>

248
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,199
Roger that.

249
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,436
Jump in ten minutes. Mark.

250
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,675
(BEEPING)

251
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,510
<i>Galactica,</i> I'd like to speak with Actual.

252
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,109
Sir?

253
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,829
Actual. Go.

254
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,793
Did I ever say thank you?

255
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,757
No, but then again, that would be a first,
wouldn't it?

256
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,035
Thank you.

257
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,759
Just come back in one piece.
That'll be thank you enough.

258
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,910
Good hunting. Actual out.

259
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,315
SAR Team, Starbuck.
Set navcom inputs to coordinate re-check.

260
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,632
Standby for bounce-back
and stabilization routines.

261
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,312
Let's do a final check, people.

262
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,188
<i>Headcase. Check.</i>

263
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,555

266
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,908

<i>Gumball. Check.</i>

268
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,835
And I'll be with you there and back.

269
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,717
It's you and me from now on, no matter what.

270
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,439
Just like we agreed.

271
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,115
I know. I know. I really appreciate it, Helo.
I really do.

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,952
I just can't get her out of my head,

Sharon, you're on.

289
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,475

290
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,399
SAR Team, Starbuck.

291
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,793
Standby to jump on my mark.

292
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,835

295
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,595
Two.

296
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,635
One.

297
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,199
Commence the first jump.

298
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,359
This doesn't look right.

299
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,032
No other contacts on dradis.

300
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,075
What?

301
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,594
Oh, man. We're at the wrong
jump coordinates.

302
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,309
Frak!

303
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,630
Helo, we've lost someone already.

304
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,514
It's Racetrack.

305
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,715
Should we go back?

306
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,634
Mission rules say we keep going
unless we lose three,

307
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,039
so we keep going.

308
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,680
Racetrack will just have to find
her way back to base.

309
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,595
It's a hell of a way to start, though.

310
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,550
Let's... Let's talk about what happened.

311
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,155
I can't really believe that Cally...

312
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:05,758
I don't understand how I
could do that to Cally.

313
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,990
It's like it's a nightmare.

314
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,035
(CALLY SCREAMING)

315
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,399
She said you were asleep
when she found you.

316
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,954
Were you having a nightmare
when she woke you up?

317
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,794
I don't remember.

318
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,315
Oh.

319
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,119
Been having any recurring dreams lately?

320
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,595
No.

321
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:38,675
Okay, that's what we
in the pray trade call a lie.

322
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,556
And lies aren't gonna get you
anywhere, my friend.

323
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,870
So skip over the denials
and the deceptions,

324
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,349
and let's get right down to it, shall we?

325
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,392
You're having dreams.

326
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,555
What are they?

327
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,671
Tell me about your dream, Chief.

328
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,630
Every night... Every night it's the same.

329
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,589
For how long?

330
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,394
Couple of weeks.

331
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,793
And you were having the same dream

332
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,598
when Cally woke you up, weren't you?

333
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,109
I don't know. I don't remember. Maybe.

334
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,875
Maybe. It doesn't matter, does it?

335
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,789
All I remember is Cally on the ground
and the blood.

336
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,714
She stopped you.

337
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,118
By waking you up, she prevented you
from carrying out

338
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,031
your secret desire to kill yourself.

339
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,594
I don't have a secret desire to kill myself.

340
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,955
Well, actually, you're right. It's not a secret.

341
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,237
You obviously want to kill yourself.
Question is, why?

342
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,952
Look, I think there was some kind of glitch
in the navcom firmware.

343
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,193
Hey, bottom line, we're to hell and gone

344
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,271
from where we're supposed to be, Skipper.

345
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,390
Okay, any chance that we can still
catch up with them?

346
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,957
Not a chance.
Mission rules say we head back.

347
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,991
Frak me! It was the first jump!

348
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,308
Hey, look, you gave me these coordinates.

349
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,753
Yeah...

350
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,993
(MUTTERING)

351
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,718
Back to the barn.

352
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:02,039
Hey, I'm picking up a large planetary body.

353
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,674
It's frakking close.

354
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,391
Where did that come from?

355
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,038
Hell if I know.

356
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,192
There's so much dradis interference here,
it didn't even register.

357
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,236
Let's check this out.

358
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,310
Atmosphere is nitrogen-oxygen.

359
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,313
Organic molecular spectra. Fresh water.

360
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:35,108
Hey, you know what this is? It's habitable.

361
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,673
We may have just found a world
that can support human life.

362
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,914
Maybe we're not just
a bunch of frakups after all.

363
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,078
Now, the climate readings overall are
within human norms.

364
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,389
Oh, there's some extremes at the poles
that we couldn't withstand,

365
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,959
but that's not unusual.

366
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,999
Well done.

367
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,798
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

368
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,159
We got a mottled area here
at the river mouth, so it's probably a delta,

369
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,038
and chances are we've got
significant plant and animal life,

370
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,759
so I want a lot of nice low passes
across here.

371
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,834
I heard the <i>Pegasus</i> survey mission
found wildlife.

372
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,749
Fruit trees, rivers of milk and honey.

373
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,190
Yeah, you forgot the lakes of ambrosia.

374
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,675
Most of the planet is actually pretty barren.

375
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,550
Plant and animal life located in
a temperate belt around the equator.

376
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,959
But the best part is, with all the dradis
interference from the nebula,

377
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,917
the Cylons will probably never find it.

378
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,275
BALTAR: <i>Who cares about</i>
<i>this stupid planet anyway?</i>

379
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,988
All this song and dance over nothing.

380
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,236
Less than 20% of that place actually supports
human life, so...

381
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,757
You're not seeing the big picture.

382
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,719
This is your new home,

383
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,751
the place where you will lead a new life.

384
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,637
This is the future, Gaius.

385
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,517
Now, there's a depressing thought.

386
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,315
What's that?

387
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,038
Oh, nothing, Tom.

388
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,068
Just...

389
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,713
Can you imagine if we actually had
to live on that thing?

390
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,395
You are a genius.

391
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,635
And?

392
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,188
Pay attention.
You're about to win the election.

393
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,911
I'm sorry. What were you saying, Tom?

394
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,470
We needed an issue, something to set us
apart from Roslin,

395
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,757
something to put her clearly on
the wrong side of a major issue

396
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,717
our people care passionately about.

397
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,755
This is it.

398
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,795
(CHUCKLING)

399
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,835
Permanent settlement on this planet.

400
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,474
Permanent settlement, here?

401
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,273
Have you lost your marbles?

402
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,836
It may look dreary. It may be dreary.

403
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,638
But it's solid ground under your feet

404
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,358
and real sky over your head.

405
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,754
You'd be surprised what a powerful idea
that is to people

406
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,149
cooped up in metal boxes for nine months.

407
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,912
You should listen to him, Gaius.

408
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,068
He's a smart, sexy man, just like you.

409
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,915
Oh, give up.

410
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,915
What?

411
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,957
Give up on Earth.

412
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,075
Yes.

413
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,596
So we'd settle here.

414
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,035
Yes.

415
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,559
(CHUCKLING)

416
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,395
(CHUCKLING)

417
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,194
You know, it's starting to look

418
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,430
like a lovely little planet after all.

419
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,196
This is a rest stop,
a place to load up on food and water.

420
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,032
We're not settling here, obviously.

421
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,235
You've heard the captains' reports.

422
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,550
Every ship in the fleet
has people begging, pleading,

423
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,437
demanding they get time
down on the surface,

424
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,317
even if it's only for a few hours.

425
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,594
Well, a few hours is one thing,

426
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,989
but permanent settlement's quite another.

427
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,958
Suddenly, Baltar is holding out hope
of breathing real air,

428
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,237
growing real food, sleeping in a bed
instead of a bunk,

429
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,311
living in a house instead of a ship.

430
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,198
It's a fantasy. Look at the mission reports.

431
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,953
All the data indicate that life on this planet
would be hard.

432
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,998
It would be a struggle to even eke
a living out for a few years.

433
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,197
Today's polls show that he's also making
headway with the idea

434
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,397
that because the planet
is hidden in a nebula,

435
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,119
it will provide a refuge from the Cylons.

436
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,079
What, are we now assuming
that Cylon technology

437
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,789
is not sufficient enough to find this planet?
We just found it.

438
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,154
Madam President, in my opinion,

439
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,993
people vote their hopes, not their fears.

440
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,511
Baltar is offering them
what they want to hear,

441
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,431
and you're offering them a bitter reality.

442
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,714
I'm offering them the truth.

443
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,998
They don't want to hear the truth.
They're tired, exhausted.

444
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,231
The idea of stopping,
laying down their burdens

445
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,038
and starting a new life right now

446
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,190
is what is resonating with the voters.

447
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,399
How well is it resonating?

448
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,275
It could turn the entire election around.

449
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,039
Why are you running?

450
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,828
I'm not.

451
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,956
How long are you gonna do this?

452
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,792
How long are you gonna refuse to see

453
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,791
what's right in front of your face?

454
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,110
How... Forget it. I'm done.

455
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,396
What? You're leaving?

456
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,993
That's right. I'm done.

457
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,275
I'm done dancing around the truth with you.

458
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,398
You know what's going on,

459
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,790
but you can't or you won't face it, so...

460
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,555
I'm not a therapist.

461
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,835
I'm not gonna hold your hand
and help you along.

462
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,229
I'm just trying to get you right with yourself
and with your Gods,

463
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,719
but you're not willing to do it.

464
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,119
But...

465
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,792
I don't even know what you're talking about.

466
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,269
Oh, for Gods' sake, Chief, come on!

467
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,799
You think you're a Cylon.

468
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,278
I am not a Cylon.

469
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,359
Well, of course you're not,

470
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,876
but that's what you're afraid of, isn't it?

471
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:43,312
That you might be a Cylon and
not even know it, just like Boomer, right?

472
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,469
Right?

473
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,832
That's the thought that's torturing
your dreams and crippling your soul.

474
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:55,551
"I'm a Cylon, just like Sharon,
and I deserve to die."

475
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:05,309
Sharon didn't know what she was.

476
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:11,037
She just kept thinking...

477
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,238
Feeling that she was gonna do
this terrible thing,

478
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,791
but she knew that she had to stop herself
before she did.

479
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,597
And you think that's what you're going to do,
some terrible thing.

480
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,033
Well, the truth is, you might,

481
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,031
but not because you're a Cylon,

482
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,039
because you're a human being

483
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,953
and human beings do terrible things
all the time.

484
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,549
Well, how do you know I'm human?

485
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,395
Oh, well, maybe because I'm a Cylon,

486
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,233
and I've never seen you
at any of the meetings.

487
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,996
There's not much more I can do for you.

488
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,991
You're gonna have to go back to work

489
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,071
and try and leave all of this behind you.

490
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,912
No, I...

491
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,474
I can't.

492
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,158
I can't go back and face
the deck people again. Are you...

493
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,474
And Cally!

494
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,836
Well, you better.
That's the only family you've got.

495
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,358
Just know that that's your family
and that they love you.

496
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,798
Even Cally. Especially Cally.

497
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,834
If you doubt your humanity and
your essential nature as a human being,

498
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,751
all you need to do is look to them

499
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,308
for the salvation you've been seeking
from the Gods.

500
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:30,795
The Gods lift up those
who lift each other, Chief.

501
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,680
SAR Team, Starbuck. We are set here.

502
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,597
Stand by for final jump to Caprica.

503
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,353
Remember, we are going
very low to the surface.

504
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,389
Be prepared for wind shear,
rain, storms, anything.

505
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,194
<i>Roger that, Starbuck.</i>

506
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,474
Ready?

507
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,235
Ready.

508
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,076
Here we go. Jump.

509
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,474
SAR Team, Starbuck. Form up on me.

510
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,909
<i>Copy that, Skipper.</i>

511
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,992
Any Cylons, Helo?

512
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,352
Nothing on dradis.

513
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,310
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

514
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,671
We're missing a Raptor.
I'm only reading 17 out there.

515
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,275
We're missing Raptor 612.

516
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,872
That's Toughguy and Carousel.

517
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,791
What, they jumped
to the wrong coordinates?

518
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,313
No, no, no.

519
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,391
I'm picking up their transponder,
so they made it.

520
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:45,917
Bearing 827 carom 443,
about a half click from here.

521
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,672
That would put them...

522
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,188
Oh, my Gods.

523
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,793
Where, Helo? Talk to me.

524
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,351
They jumped inside the mountain.

525
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,675
Damn.

526
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:08,236
SAR Team, Starbuck. We've lost Raptor 612.

527
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,078
We are proceeding without them.

528
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,235
Follow me.

529
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,435
<i>Roger that, Starbuck.</i>

530
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,476
BALTAR: <i>So I would think that my position</i>

531
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,915
<i>and the position of my campaign</i>
<i>is abundantly clear.</i>

532
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,955
<i>Thank you.</i>

533
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,996
McMANUS: <i>Madam President,</i>
<i>you have 30 seconds to respond.</i>

534
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:32,436
<i>Well, my initial response is,</i>
<i>there he goes again.</i>

535
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,272
<i>Once again, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

536
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:38,148
<i>Dr Baltar is distorting</i>
<i>the real issues before us.</i>

537
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,277
<i>The issue here, the real question, is not</i>

538
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,352
<i>allowing the scriptures to dictate the policy</i>
<i>of this government.</i>

539
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:49,230
<i>The question is, do the scriptures</i>
<i>contain real-world relevance?</i>

540
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,231
<i>Do they contain the information necessary</i>
<i>to guide us to a safer home</i>

541
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,992
<i>than some completely unknown planet</i>

542
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,593
<i>that we've just now discovered?</i>

543
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,989
<i>Obviously, my answer</i>
<i>to that question is yes.</i>

544
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,435
<i>I have always and will continue to feel</i>

545
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,193
<i>the scriptures hold real-world relevance.</i>

546
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,793
<i>Mr Vice President,</i>
<i>the next question is for you.</i>

547
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,075
<i>How do you respond to the charges</i>

548
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,310
<i>that you've seized the idea of permanent</i>
<i>settlement on this planet</i>

549
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,277
<i>as an opportunistic gamble?</i>

550
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,238
<i>Some would say it's to be construed</i>
<i>as a desperate move</i>

551
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,278
<i>from a campaign that was falling behind</i>
<i>in every poll.</i>

552
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,634
<i>Well, you know, that is...</i>

553
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,280
<i>That is an excellent question, in fact, Jim.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

554
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,511
<i>And I am only too glad to</i>
<i>have the opportunity to respond to it.</i>

555
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,990
<i>You see, I have long been a proponent</i>
<i>in the search for Earth.</i>

556
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,356
<i>The promise of perhaps</i>
<i>finding not only a new home</i>

557
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,919
<i>but also the prospect of discovering</i>

558
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,039
<i>our long lost brothers and sisters</i>
<i>of the 13th Colony is a powerful one,</i>

559
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,634
<i>and one I have believed in heart and soul,</i>

560
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:47,508
<i>but the trouble is,</i>
<i>the Cylons continue to follow us</i>

561
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,000
<i>as they have done every step of the way</i>

562
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,275
<i>since the destruction of the Colonies.</i>

563
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:58,354
<i>And if we have a chance to change</i>
<i>this dynamic, to stop this deadly chase,</i>

564
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,397
<i>shouldn't we take it? My answer is yes.</i>

565
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,549
MAN: Oh, yeah. Come on.

566
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,676
<i>Thank you. Madam President, 30 seconds.</i>

567
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,274
<i>There's no assurance, none whatsoever,</i>

568
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,074
<i>that the Cylons don't already know</i>
<i>about this planet,</i>

569
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,628
<i>that they don't make regular stops here</i>
<i>looking for us,</i>

570
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,359
<i>and that, in fact, they aren't</i>
<i>simply waiting for us</i>

571
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,839
<i>to settle on the surface</i>
<i>so they can attack us...</i>

572
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,514
<i>I have to respond to that.</i>
<i>I simply have to respond to that.</i>

573
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,238
<i>I'll give you 15 seconds.</i>

574
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,799
<i>What you've seen right now,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen,</i>

575
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:28,112
<i>is another example of the President</i>
<i>using fear to drive her campaign.</i>

576
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,389
<i>Fear.</i>

577
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,549
<i>Fear of the Gods.</i>

578
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,755
<i>Fear of the Cylon. Fear of fear itself.</i>

579
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,717
<i>Is it not time to stop being afraid?</i>

580
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,479
<i>I'm asking all of us</i>

581
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,709
<i>to stop running from our lives</i>
<i>and start living them.</i>

582
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,595
<i>Thank you.</i>

583
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,830
<i>Thank you. That is all we have time for today.</i>

584
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,878
<i>I'd like to thank both the candidates</i>
<i>for their frankness today.</i>

585
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,075
<i>A very exciting debate.</i>

586
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,277
<i>And this concludes the cycle of the debates</i>
<i>for the Presidency.</i>

587
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,752
<i>The polls will open in three days.</i>
<i>Please vote.</i>

588
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,478
<i>Thank you and good night.</i>

(WHISPERING)

590
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,399
Not your night, I guess.

591
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,710
Why don't you go frak yourself?

00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:15,553
MAN: (ON RADIO) <i>With me now is campaign</i>
<i>manager for Dr Baltar, Mr Tom Zarek.</i>

593
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:18,029
<i>Tom, welcome.</i>
<i>You were in there with us today.</i>

594
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,553
<i>What was your impression?</i>

595
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:23,749
ZAREK: <i>Well, I thought Dr Baltar</i>
<i>did exceptionally well.</i>

596
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,628
<i>Laid out his vision of the future</i>

597
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,234
<i>and offered the people a way to end</i>
<i>the suffering and terror</i>

598
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,799
<i>that defines so many of their lives.</i>

599
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,030
<i>On the other hand, I found myself wondering</i>

600
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,874
<i>how Roslin's arguments against settlement</i>
<i>could possibly win.</i>

601
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:11,230
(WHISPERING) Watch your footing over here.
On me. Let's go.

602
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,237
Get up to that line, right there.

603
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,275
Got it.

604
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,949
All right, hold it.

605
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,637
Let's figure out where we are, Karl.

606
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:49,837
Resistance base camp
was still another click ahead.

607
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,793
Movement. 11:00.

00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,515
Friendlies?

610
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,431
You got a Samuel T. Anders there?

611
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,671
BAROLAY: Is there a Kara Thrace there?

612
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,870
If there is, you tell her she took her
good sweet time getting here.

613
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,593
Friendlies.

614
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,073
What took you so long?

615
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,192
We got Marines and Raptors.

616
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,589
We're gonna get you and your people
out of here, okay?

617
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,079
As good as your word, huh?

618
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,151
Yeah, good as my frakking word.

619
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,196
What, did you think
I was gonna leave you here?

620
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,077
Now you feel like a big frakking idiot,
don't you?

621
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,549
All right, just shut up
and save us already, okay?

622
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,189
Okay, people, this is nice,
but we have toasters on our ass.

623
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,356
Where are the rest of your people?

624
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,759
This is it.

625
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,195
Toasters hit our base camp this morning.

626
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,633
I lost half my crew.

627
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,308

629
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,709
Back to the Raptors!

630
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,789
No!

631
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,950
The shell trajectories are between us
and the Raptors!

632
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,473
We're cut off!

00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,788
