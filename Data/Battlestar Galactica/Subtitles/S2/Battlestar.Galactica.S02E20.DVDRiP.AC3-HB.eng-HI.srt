00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,116
NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on</i> Battlestar Galactica.

2
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,955
We lost her.

3
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,953
We did the best we could, but she's dead.
And that's all there is to it.

4
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,430
It's you and me from now on, no matter what.
Just like we agreed.

5
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,557
I just can't get her out of my head,
our little girl.

6
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,708
She's so beautiful.

7
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,550
You understand, Maya, that this adoption
requires absolute secrecy.

8
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,629
You have my word.

9
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,710
I'm leaving <i>Galactica,</i> not you.

10
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,155
I don't know how we can.

11
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,038
I don't either, but I know I'm gonna try

12
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,595
if you will.

13
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,513
I'm Brother Cavil.

14
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,394
I understand you asked
for religious counselling.

15
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,754
Let's talk about what happened.

16
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,795
Chief?

17
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,109
Ah!

18
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,313
TYROL: <i>I don't understand</i>
<i>how I could do that to Cally.</i>

19
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,469
BROTHER CAVIL: <i>You think you're a Cylon.</i>

20
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,959
I am not a Cylon.

21
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,992
Well, of course you're not.

22
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,071
But that's what you're afraid of, isn't it?

23
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,311
CAIN: <i>We have our own Cylon prisoner.</i>

24
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,914
NO. 6: <i>She's obviously</i>
<i>been abused, tortured.</i>

25
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,875
I know a place where you can stay,
where you will be safe.

26
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,431
<i>Where I can look after you...</i>

27
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,473
Vice President Baltar offered the contents
of this case as proof of his sincerity.

28
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,439
GINA: A nuclear bomb?

29
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,111
I'm afraid that that I have no alternative

30
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,033
but to announce that I am,
as of now, a candidate for the presidency.

31
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,470
What should be important to you, personally,

32
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,835
is that Roslin's up three points in the polls.

33
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,878
SKULLS: Hey, I am picking
up a large planetary body.

34
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,838
Hey, you know what this is?

35
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,193
It's habitable.

36
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,433
<i>We may have just found</i>
<i>a world that can support human life.</i>

37
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,748
ZAREK: <i>We needed an issue,</i>

38
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,951
something to set us apart from Roslin.

39
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,120
This is it.

40
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,589
Permanent settlement on this planet.

41
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,994
What took you so long?

42
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,638
We got Marines and <i>Raptors.</i>

43
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,472
We're gonna get you and your people
out of here, okay?

44
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,549
Incoming!

45
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,958
MARINE: Go! Go! Go!

46
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,314
MAN: There's no way out!

47
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,909
Go! Move!

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,955
WOMAN: Get up and get going.

49
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,268
They've got us zeroed in.

50
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,793
If we stay here, they're gonna chew us up!

51
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,996
All right, we've got to fall back.
Position up this hill. Let's go!

52
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,196
- Let's move, people!
- MARINE 1: Let's go! Let's go!

53
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,628
MARINE 2: Let's go! Let's go!

54
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,558
(SCREAMING)

55
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,869
The jaw's set nicely. You're done here.

56
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,310
I'm kicking you out of here
and sending you back to work.

57
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,628
Work? Like this?

58
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,590
You gotta love a woman who can complain
even with her jaw wired shut.

59
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,995
You got a visitor.

60
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,674
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,429
What I did was

62
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,869
unforgivable,

63
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,469
inexcusable.

64
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,275
I didn't come here to...

65
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,349
I forgive you.

66
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,153
No, Cally, no.

67
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,952
It wasn't you. I know that.

68
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,469
It wasn't you.

69
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,274
It was me.

70
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,390
I may have been out of my mind
and not know where I was...

71
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,917
Doing or anything, but it was me.

72
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,314
You're in pain.

73
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,154
I know you've been in pain
for a really long time.

74
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,755
Don't feel sorry for me.

75
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,112
I care about you. I always have.

76
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,558
I always will.

77
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,519
BOOMER: Move! Come on!

78
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,508
- Let's go! Let's go!
- MARINE: Come on, get up!

79
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,995
Get them up! Get them up!

80
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,315
This way!

81
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,429
HELO: Let's go! Get in there! Let's go!

82
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,955
Let's go! Let's go!

83
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,675
STARBUCK: Come on, get in here!

84
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,432
HELO: Get him up there!
Get him up there, now!

85
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,479
Sharon, take the gun!

86
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,955
Ammo!

87
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,391
(PEOPLE SHOUTING)

88
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,591
STARBUCK: They've got us
boxed in here really good!

89
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,189
Frak!

90
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,949
Can't reach the Raptors.

91
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,354
The Cylons have jammed the freqs.

92
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,919
MARINE: Frak!

93
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,589
Are they still out there?

94
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,869
Watch yourself.

95
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,190
STARBUCK: Yeah, they're holding back now.

96
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,789
Yeah, but why?

97
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,398
They're holding position,
sending for non-lethal weapons.

98
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,153
They want some prisoners for interrogation.

99
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,468
The rest they're gonna send to the farm.

100
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,912
STARBUCK: I'm not going back
to one of those farms.

101
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,315
Yeah, well, you don't have any choice.
None of us will.

102
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,914
They're gonna lob some gas in here
and then we'll all wake up somewhere else.

103
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,909
Damn.

104
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,399
So what you want to do here?

105
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,712
Sit it out. Wait and see if she's right.

106
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,197
If she is, then you and me,
we've gotta have an agreement.

107
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,269
An agreement?

108
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,479
I'm not going back to
one of those farms, Sam. I'm not.

109
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,633
So if she's right

110
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,158
and they throw gas in here,

111
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,273
you do me, I do you.

112
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,474
What are you talking about?

113
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,555
This is what I'm talking about, okay?

114
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,995
Yeah, okay.

115
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,549
Okay.

116
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:51,472
Down two more points, and this after
hearing his notions of social policy.

117
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,394
Not to mention his wishful thinking
that he's calling security policy.

118
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,472
Are people really gonna be that stupid?

119
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,354
Are they really gonna be that shortsighted?

120
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,516
TORY: He's got the only
issue people care about.

121
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,999
Oh, I know. The planet.

122
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,594
That's all anybody wants to talk about
is a frakking planet.

123
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,558
Excuse my...
My language, Tory. I'm sorry.

124
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,592
I know in my gut that settling on
this planet's gonna mean disaster

125
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,514
for humanity, and I will not say otherwise
just to win an election.

126
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,112
As you wish, Madam President.

127
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,556
So, I guess I should
start packing up my office

128
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,713
unless you have some super-secret back-up
plan for victory in your pocket.

129
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,240
There's always a back-up plan for victory.

130
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,433
Just in time for the priest.

131
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,272
Oh, good. Send him in.

132
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,874
18 hours.

133
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,309
They're taking their good,
sweet time out there.

134
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,352
They could've overrun us
at any point during the night.

135
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,077
They're up to something.

136
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,634
What are we up to?

137
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,553
Got any brilliant ideas
in that military brain of yours?

138
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,790
We do the same thing, we always do,

139
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,478
fight them till we can't.

140
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,399
HELO: What do you think?

141
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,992
Let's get a recon crew together.

142
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,479
Scout the area.

143
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,439
Figure out what's going on out there.

144
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,235
Clear.

145
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,393
They're gone.

146
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,114
They just left.

147
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,233
Thank the Gods.

148
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,719
It's a miracle.

149
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,033
Let us pray.

150
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,754
Lords of Kobol, we trust in your benevolence
and praise your righteousness.

151
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:42,156
Give the people of this fleet the wisdom
to see the goodness

152
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,755
and the strength of your servant,
Laura Roslin.

153
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,269
Amen.

154
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,195
Admiral?

155
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,752
Madam President...

156
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,671
The Admiral's not here.

157
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,473
This is my meeting.

158
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,155
I wanted us to talk privately,
without the press getting wind of it.

159
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,878
Please have a seat.

160
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,313
Well, you must have something
very interesting to say to resort to such

161
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,915
pedestrian methods of deception.

162
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,675
The question of permanent settlement

163
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,596
may well be the most important issue
we face since the attack.

164
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,552
- I agree.
- Good.

165
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,716
The question should be carefully studied
before making the final decision.

166
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:59,515
And the middle of an election campaign
is hardly the time for careful study.

167
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,630
Therefore, I propose a truce.

168
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,837
You and I will issue a joint statement

169
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,878
declaring that the question be tabled
till after this election.

170
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,631
We will both pledge that regardless
of who is elected,

171
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,990
the decision will be made only
after careful deliberation

172
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,594
involving all elements of the public,

173
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,875
and after consultation with the military
and the Quorum of Twelve.

174
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,189
Doctor,

175
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,230
I know we've had our disagreements,

176
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,316
but this issue transcends

for reelection has become.

You'll resort to anything

I'm afraid my affairs on Caprica,

198

Sorry to bust up your day, Brother,

326
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,951
but there's been a change of plans.

327
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,953
It's been decided that the occupation
of the Colonies was an error.

328
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,358
I could have told them that.

329
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,590
Bad thinking, faulty logic.

Their voices carry a lot of weight,

336
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,389
so when they started talking
about our mistakes and our corruption

337
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,675
and our need for a new beginning,

338
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,352

You see, we're not like you.

340
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,638
We can admit our mistakes,
and we're not afraid of change.

341
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,996
So you abandoned the Colonies,

342
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,233
leaving behind a devastated,
nuclear wasteland.

343
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,833

was another error.

the universe has ever seen.

So, instead of pursuing our own destiny

356
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,792
of trying to find
our own path to enlightenment,

357
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,118
we hijacked yours.

358
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,912
You said it, Brother.

359
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,797
My mission here is simple.

360
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,473
I'm to tell you that you've been given
a reprieve.

361
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,590
Cylon and man will now go
their separate ways.

362
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,274
No harm done.

363
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,794
No harm?

364
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,877
You completely annihilated our race

365
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,951
and destroyed our civilization.

366
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,594
Now, if you're gonna start pointing fingers...

367
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,274
Where did the Cylons go?
Back to their home world?

368
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,309
Well, I'd rather not say just now.

369
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,278
Let's just say we have other plans.

370
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,949
New marching orders by your one true god?

371
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,957
There is no god.

372
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,039
Supernatural divinities
are the primitive's answer

373
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,190
for why the sun goes down at night.

374
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,874
At least that's what we've been telling
the others for years.

375
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,758
We can't really prove it
one way or the other, of course.

376
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,397
You know a way to prove it?

377
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,678
Throw them both out the airlock.
Let them see if there really is a Cylon god.

378
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,189
Ballots from the <i>Adriatic.</i> D?

379
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,512
Right. This way.

380
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,473
MCMANUS: (ON RADIO)
<i>It has been an exciting day.</i>

381
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,120
<i>The election has been</i>
<i>a real rollercoaster ride.</i>

382
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,669
The polls now have been closed
for about five hours,

383
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,274
results have come in,
and it's been a see-saw battle,

384
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,430
back and forth between
the presidential candidates.

385
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,478
<i>So, all night long,</i>
<i>as we suspected it would be.</i>

386
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,552
<i>We're still waiting for a few more numbers</i>
<i>to come in now,</i>

387
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,676
<i>from the counting room of</i> Galactica,

388
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,479
<i>which, I must tell you,</i>
<i>as some of you may know,</i>

389
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,915
<i>was the source of a bit</i>
<i>of a controversy yesterday.</i>

390
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,468
<i>Councilman Zarek</i>
<i>had filed a formal complaint</i>

391
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,393
<i>against the use of military...</i>

392
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,755
<i>The military involvement</i>
<i>in the election process.</i>

393
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,354
<i>Now, it's just reached...</i>
<i>A compromise was just reached</i>

394
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,351
<i>late yesterday, allowing</i> Galactica

395
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,635
<i>to provide security for the balloting,</i>

396
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,951
<i>as well as civilians to oversee</i>

397
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,315
<i>and then to monitor the situation.</i>

398
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,235
<i>Yes, okay. Now we have some more</i>
<i>votes coming in here.</i>

399
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:49,235
<i>Still not done, but what we have so far is</i>
<i>6,282 more votes for Baltar,</i>

400
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,912
<i>which puts his total now to</i>

401
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,750
21,569.

402
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,875
Is that... Is that correct?

403
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,188
And we also have Roslin.

404
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:00,478
Her total now is at 17,754.

405
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:06,079
<i>We've had 2,981 more votes</i>
<i>come in for Roslin at this time.</i>

406
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,277
<i>So that is how things</i>
<i>are looking at this point.</i>

407
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,758
<i>We'll continue to bring you up-to-the-minute</i>
<i>coverage as the count progresses.</i>

408
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,473
Yeah, it's me.

409
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,313
Is this a secure line?

410
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,075
Okay.

411
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,198
There are only five ships left to report in.

412
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,718
We need to move now.

413
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,118
I'll take care of it.

414
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,994
Lieutenant.

415
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,472
I'll be right back.

416
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,239
Are those the ballots from the <i>Zephyr?</i>

417
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,639
Yes, sir.

418
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,153
All right, we'll take it from here.

419
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,878
We were told to take it to the ballot room, sir.

420
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,554
Counting has already begun.
We'll take it from here.

421
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,794
GAETA: Right there, please.

422
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,839
Last one.

423
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,438
<i>We have some more results that</i>
<i>have come in here now.</i>

424
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,794
<i>And, uh...</i>

425
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:47,350
Wow, okay. 8,593 for Roslin,

426
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,358
now, which puts her over the top.

427
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,797
<i>That's 24,265 for Laura Roslin.</i>

428
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,949
<i>Is that correct?</i>

429
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:59,272
<i>And 22,266 for Gaius Baltar.</i>

430
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,199
<i>We're gonna check these again</i>
<i>because that has put her over the top.</i>

431
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,474
<i>She... She has done it.</i>

432
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,073
<i>She has retained the Presidency</i>

433
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,755
<i>in an improbable comeback</i>
<i>in the final hours of the campaign.</i>

434
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,753
Again we will, of course,
like to check those numbers if we could,

435
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,469
but it appears that Laura Roslin has
retained the Presidency

436
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:20,434
<i>in defiance of the polls, the pundits</i>
<i>and the purveyors of gloom and doom.</i>

437
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,478
<i>But I've never seen a political race</i>
<i>end like this,</i>

438
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,039
<i>but it has just happened.</i>

439
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,190
<i>I'm James McManus.</i>
<i>We'll check those numbers</i>

440
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,669
<i>and we'll get back to you very shortly.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

441
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,396
I've seen a lot of elections, Gaius.

442
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,272
Most honest, a few fixed.

443
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,957
And you can always tell the fixed ones
because they don't make sense.

444
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,990
And this doesn't make sense.

445
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,069
Laura Roslin is many things,

446
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,152
but she's not corrupt.

447
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,318
And she's not dishonest.

448
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,434
It's over.

449
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,432
Congratulations, Madam President.

450
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,033
Well, thank you.

451
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,115
I hope you don't take this the wrong way,

452
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,318
but are you as shocked as I am?

453
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,193
I'm relieved.

454
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,318
<i>Well, you don't sound it.</i>

455
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,393
I'm just tired.

456
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,596
It's been a long campaign.

457
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,315
Colonel?

458
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,311
May I speak to you for a moment?

459
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,674
What's up?

460
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:46,910
Sir, I'm afraid these ballots
from the <i>Zephyr</i> are wrong.

461
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,837
What the hell are you talking about?

462
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,912
Dr Baltar's name is spelled correctly
on these ballots.

463
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,672
But this morning the <i>Zephyr</i> called me

464
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,988
and told me their ballots had a misprint.

465
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,275
They misspelled Baltar's first name.

466
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,918
We didn't have time to print new ballots,

467
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,276
so I told them on my authority to go ahead,
use them anyway.

468
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,357
Baltar's name is spelled correctly here.

469
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,839
So they couldn't have come from the <i>Zephyr.</i>

470
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,148
They're frauds.

471
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,233
Now, there's a complete chain of custody

472
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,276
from the <i>Zephyr,</i> all the way into this room.

473
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,874
So someone in the chain
is either the perpetrator

474
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,439
or at least, a willing ally in...

475
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,839
Thanks for bringing this to my attention.

476
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,478
I'll take care of it from here.

477
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,269
Yes, sir.

478
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,476
We should at least notify
the civilian observers

479
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,913
and the press that these ballots will...

480
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,195
I said I'll take care of it from here.

481
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,314
Yes, sir.

482
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,110
Madam President, you should celebrate.

483
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,634
<i>It's a great victory and you've earned it.</i>

484
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,835
(INTERCOM BUZZING)

485
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,194
Excuse me.

486
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,034
<i>Admiral, we'll talk later. Thank you.</i>

487
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,429
Adama.

488
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,953
<i>Yes, sir, this is Lieutenant Gaeta.</i>

489
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,909
Sir,

490
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,995
<i>I don't know how to say this...</i>

491
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,718
Fast and straight, I'd advise.

492
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,755
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

493
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,069
Admiral, I believe that Colonel Tigh is
involved in a conspiracy

494
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,594
to rig the election for President Roslin.

495
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,511
When I confronted the Colonel,
he admitted his guilt.

496
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,874
He said he acted in collusion
with your campaign manager,

497
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,313
Tory Foster.

498
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,118
Saul said Tory had contacted him
a few days ago.

499
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,714
He did it because he felt that Baltar
as president would be a disaster.

500
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,632
I said I agree,

501
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,795
but that what he had done was illegal.

502
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,755
A judicial tribunal may have to be convened.

503
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,875
Stop.

504
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,231
I gave Tory the go ahead.

505
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,354
I didn't know exactly what she was planning.

506
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,113
I certainly didn't know about Colonel Tigh.
Oh, my Gods.

507
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,352
But I did know that she was planning
to fix the vote.

508
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,836
You tried to steal an election?

509
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,069
Yes, I did.

510
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,678
And I got caught.

511
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,958
But Gaius Baltar

512
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,713
cannot become President
of the Colonies, Bill.

513
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,472
It cannot happen.

514
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,989
Laura,

515
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,072
I don't want him as President either, but...

516
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,991
He's working with the Cylons.

517
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:37,919
I saw him just before the attack on Caprica

518
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,638
with a copy of the tall, blonde Cylon woman.

519
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:44,314
The same model who accused Baltar
of treason

520
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,231
before disappearing from <i>Galactica.</i>

521
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,958
What the hell are you saying?

522
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,951
Why didn't you say something before this?

523
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,713
Because I didn't remember
seeing him with that woman

524
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,552
until I remembered it when I was dying.

525
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:57,108
I know how that sounds, but it's real.

526
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,671

527

of a democratic election or not?

536

557
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,516
Exactly what kind of a tabulating error

558
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,953
could have occurred on your ship

559
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,349
that could have swung several
thousand votes away from me

560
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,318
in favour of your preferred candidate,
Admiral?

561
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:32,192
As soon as I have the time,
there will be an investigation.

562
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,589
I suggest that you take your victory

563
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,868

I think you'll find I can be magnanimous
in victory, Admiral.

565
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,391

at this time is

You are supposed to be in bed.

Hey, Doc, wait.

00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:24,109
So?

727
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,471
There's fluid in the lungs.

728
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:29,359
It's probably pneumonia.

729
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,953
So give him something.

730
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:32,868
I'd love to.

735

So, make him rest, keep him warm

736
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,030

that the engine you've built
with your blood and your sweat

774
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:45,991

for something so foul,

your body on the gears

and make it stop.
