we have everything!

00:10:46,611 --> 00:10:48,784
What's going on, Saul?
Where's the fleet?

179
00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:51,310
We don't know. They
jumped to another location.

180
00:10:51,314 --> 00:10:53,906
You've got blood on your
pants. Why would they do that?

181
00:10:53,941 --> 00:10:56,498
Every watch, we update our
emergency jump calculations...

182
00:10:56,533 --> 00:10:57,990
with new star fixes...

183
00:10:58,002 --> 00:10:59,697
to compensate
for inertial drift.

184
00:10:59,699 --> 00:11:02,178
And then we transmit them
to the rest of the fleet.

185
00:11:02,213 --> 00:11:04,658
This time, ours were updated,
but theirs weren't.

186
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:07,672
Gaeta was supposed to transmit
them to the rest of the fleet.

187
00:11:07,707 --> 00:11:08,896
So it's Gaeta's fault.

188
00:11:08,914 --> 00:11:11,644
The kid was overwhelmed.
He had his hands full.

189
00:11:11,954 --> 00:11:14,900
If you say so. It sounds like
a pretty big screw-up to me.

190
00:11:14,935 --> 00:11:17,846
I should have checked before
I gave the order to jump!

191
00:11:18,706 --> 00:11:22,802
This doesn't sound like you,
Saul. You don't let people slide.

192

You bust their ass.

193
00:11:25,298 --> 00:11:26,890
Now if Bill doesn't make it...

194
00:11:26,898 --> 00:11:27,922
He'll make it.

195
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:30,767
If he doesn't, this will
be your ship. Your command.

196
00:11:30,802 --> 00:11:34,397
All I'm saying is you need to
be... This is Bill Adama's ship.

197
00:11:34,432 --> 00:11:36,013
This is his command.

198
00:11:37,075 --> 00:11:40,306
His orders are still the
word of the gods on this ship.

199
00:11:41,298 --> 00:11:42,822
Just so we're clear.

200
00:11:44,178 --> 00:11:47,579
This will be Adama's command
until the day he dies.

201
00:11:47,891 --> 00:11:50,223
And we are not
going to let him die.

202
00:11:52,018 --> 00:11:53,508

00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,527
So how do we find the fleet?

206
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:04,975
If we jump back
to our original coordinates...

207
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:08,446
our Nav computers can use those star
fixes to generate a best-fit solution...

208
00:12:08,481 --> 00:12:10,096
giving the fleet's
current position.

209
00:12:10,131 --> 00:12:12,395
The Cylons are waiting
for us back there.

How long will it take to
calculate once we get back there?

211

all other functions...

212

12 hours.

213
00:12:22,898 --> 00:12:26,459
There's no way we can hold off
a Cylon Base Star for 12 hours.

214
00:12:28,594 --> 00:12:31,119
We have got to jump back.
We can't stay here.

215
00:12:31,154 --> 00:12:34,715
Lt. Thrace won't be able to find us once
she retrieves the arrow from Caprica.

216
00:12:34,835 --> 00:12:37,269
If she retrieves the arrow.
She'll retrieve the arrow.

217

Captain, you've got to get reinstated.
You've got to get back to CIC.

218
00:12:41,651 --> 00:12:44,871
You've got to denounce me, disavow
me, do whatever you need to do.

won't forget that anytime soon.
