180

The President has decided
that her pregnancy will be terminated.

181
00:11:51,847 --> 00:11:52,916
What?

182
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,042
Why?

183
00:11:56,127 --> 00:11:59,039
Doc Cottle discovered some anomalies

184
00:11:59,527 --> 00:12:01,199
in the foetal blood work.

185
00:12:02,007 --> 00:12:03,759
Isn't that expected?

186
00:12:04,087 --> 00:12:05,122
Maybe.

187
00:12:05,847 --> 00:12:07,599
But the President believes

188
00:12:07,687 --> 00:12:09,803
that to allow the baby to come to full term,

189
00:12:09,887 --> 00:12:13,197
it constitutes an unacceptable risk
to the Fleet.

190

00:12:16,207 --> 00:12:19,279
Sharon's only helped us
since she came back from Caprica.

192
00:12:19,367 --> 00:12:20,720
She even turned on her own.

193
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:22,160
To save her life.

194
00:12:22,727 --> 00:12:24,479
Don't mistake the will to live

195
00:12:25,527 --> 00:12:27,722

196
00:12:29,247 --> 00:12:30,646
She's still the enemy.

197
00:12:31,647 --> 00:12:33,000
Does she know?

198
00:12:33,567 --> 00:12:34,716
Not yet.

199
00:12:36,247 --> 00:12:38,636
Then I should be the one to tell her.

for reinstating me as CAG, sir.

213

Maybe that was a mistake.

214
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,720
Maybe I don't give a damn
what you think, sir.

Take it easy, both of you.

216
00:13:22,287 --> 00:13:25,165
The fact is we've been sharing stores
between the ships.

217

And nobody flies combat
until our ammo supplies check out.

insisted on your taking the tour.

a lot of responsibility.

377
00:21:42,607 --> 00:21:44,086
It's tradition for outgoing Presidents

So you've become a member
of the peace movement?

397

Well, despite what you may think,

Of course not.
Even their dedication has limits.

So is there any reason in particular
for inviting me around here?

Because you saved me.

Let me save you.

maybe we could have done more.

You've been thinking this is a mistake

Laura, what did you give them?

443
00:26:28,207 --> 00:26:29,481

that we would seriously
hear out their grievances, Richard.

00:26:33,207 --> 00:26:36,279
I thought you'd be happy
they're going back to work.

Laura,

447
00:26:38,487 --> 00:26:40,717
you've put me in a very awkward position.

448
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:42,320
I don't see how.

449
00:26:42,927 --> 00:26:44,565
Both sides gave ground.

It's not just about your teachers.

451

It's the next strike I'm worried about.

452
00:26:48,647 --> 00:26:50,877
You just showed them
that if they hold out long enough,

453
00:26:50,967 --> 00:26:52,798
this administration will cave.

454
00:26:52,887 --> 00:26:55,481
You expected me to fail.

455
00:26:55,567 --> 00:26:57,762
I expected you to hold the line.

456
00:26:58,487 --> 00:27:01,160
This doesn't have to be
the end of the world.

457
00:27:01,247 --> 00:27:05,286
You can stay on in an advisory capacity.
Gods know we need your ideas.

458
00:27:05,687 --> 00:27:07,484
You're asking me to resign?

459
00:27:07,967 --> 00:27:09,844
I don't have any choice.

460
00:27:10,127 --> 00:27:12,243
This isn't about you and me anymore.

461
00:27:12,327 --> 00:27:13,806
You're right, it's not.

462
00:27:13,887 --> 00:27:15,764
You were willing to attack those people,

463
00:27:15,847 --> 00:27:18,281

I was prepared to let you.

Doctor, get the hell out of here!

492
00:29:43,927 --> 00:29:46,236
I must talk to you
concerning the Cylon child.

493
00:29:46,327 --> 00:29:48,238
It seems I may have been

494
00:29:49,527 --> 00:29:50,642
wrong,

495
00:29:51,407 --> 00:29:52,726
very wrong,

496
00:29:53,687 --> 00:29:57,202
when I said that Dr Cottle misinterpreted
the foetal blood work.

497
00:30:07,447 --> 00:30:09,039
You see, I had another look at those samples

498
00:30:09,127 --> 00:30:12,005
and I discovered something quite intriguing.

499
00:30:12,247 --> 00:30:16,399
Understand, Cylon blood is virtually
impossible to differentiate from our own.

500
00:30:16,487 --> 00:30:18,637
That being said,
obviously it has to be slightly different

501
00:30:18,727 --> 00:30:20,445
because the Cylon is not human.

502
00:30:24,767 --> 00:30:26,359
If our blood

503
00:30:27,087 --> 00:30:29,726
looks like this,

504
00:30:30,687 --> 00:30:31,915
for example,

505
00:30:33,007 --> 00:30:36,841
and the Cylon's blood looks like this,

506
00:30:40,847 --> 00:30:45,045
then it's fair to assume that the
Cylon-human is carrying an amalgam.

507
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:47,919
Is this a theory or fact?

508
00:30:48,007 --> 00:30:50,885
The Cylon's foetus contains no antigens,

509
00:30:50,967 --> 00:30:52,241
it has no blood type.

510
00:30:52,327 --> 00:30:55,000
That's what Dr Cottle was talking about
when he said it was damned odd.

511
00:30:55,087 --> 00:30:57,317
Except it's not damned
odd, it's astonishing.

512
00:30:57,447 --> 00:30:59,358
Now, knowing, as we do,

513
00:30:59,447 --> 00:31:02,519
that the Cylons are built slightly better
to endure than their human counterparts,

514
00:31:02,607 --> 00:31:06,486
I wondered, could the Cylon blood
also be blessed, shall we say blessed,

515
00:31:06,687 --> 00:31:09,281
with a heightened resistance to disease?

516
00:31:11,607 --> 00:31:12,642
So

517
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:16,000
I applied a sample

518
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,038
of Sharon's foetal blood

519
00:31:18,647 --> 00:31:21,605
to some cancer cells
I took from the President.

520
00:31:30,767 --> 00:31:32,086
What am I looking at?

521
00:31:32,167 --> 00:31:33,282
Nothing.

522
00:31:33,407 --> 00:31:34,840
That's the whole point.

523
00:31:34,927 --> 00:31:37,725
The cancer was gone
and it was gone within a matter of hours.

524
00:31:38,007 --> 00:31:40,567
Are you saying you've found a cure
for the President's cancer?

525
00:31:40,647 --> 00:31:42,046
Well, it's untried.

526
00:31:43,127 --> 00:31:46,358
It's obviously untried
and therefore extremely dangerous.

527
