away from the Cylon home world

26
00:01:33,887 --> 00:01:37,516
for the normal downloading process to
work. Which is why they built this ship.

27

It contains the entire apparatus
necessary for Cylon resurrection.

28

who dies out here...

29

on the Resurrection ship,

175

I volunteered for this one.

176

That's how you resolve your
differences with your superior officers?

problem backing up Starbuck,

watching her back.

I'm not going to debate this with you.

188
00:14:10,334 --> 00:14:12,063
This was
a very hard decision.

189
00:14:12,831 --> 00:14:14,628
But I think
the President's right.

190
00:14:15,262 --> 00:14:17,526
This is the best way
to safeguard the fleet.

Yes.

it wasn't the one you prepared.

was a flawed creation.

kill one another

235

345
00:30:26,878 --> 00:30:29,506
Commander, I wonder if my XO
is standing close by?

346
00:30:29,854 --> 00:30:30,912
Yes, he is.

347
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,716
<i>FISK: Yes, sir.</i>

348
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:45,368
Congratulations, Jack.

349
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:47,207
Thank you, sir.

350
00:30:57,533 --> 00:30:58,830
That's all.

351
00:31:00,093 --> 00:31:01,287
Yes, sir.

352
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:09,523
You look like
you could use a drink.

353
00:31:09,533 --> 00:31:10,522
(SIGHING)

354
00:31:23,773 --> 00:31:25,001
Thank you.

355
00:31:25,725 --> 00:31:27,962
Oh, by the way, there was
something I wanted to tell you.

356
00:31:27,997 --> 00:31:30,761
Last night, I was walking down
this corridor here, when I saw...

357
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:35,890
(NECK SNAPPING)

358
00:31:53,565 --> 00:31:55,658
No, no, no.

359
00:31:56,285 --> 00:31:57,718
I can't...
I can't do this.

360
00:31:58,109 --> 00:32:01,601
Suicide is a sin.
But I need to die.

361
00:32:01,918 --> 00:32:06,378
What you need is justice.

362
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:22,103
I know a place where you can
stay, where you will be safe,

363
00:32:22,493 --> 00:32:24,586
where I can
look after you.

364
00:32:24,605 --> 00:32:25,594
Why?

365
00:32:26,845 --> 00:32:28,676
Why would you do that?

366
00:32:29,117 --> 00:32:30,812
Because I love you.

367
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:12,078
(SIGHING)

368
00:33:38,653 --> 00:33:39,950
Tell me, Admiral,

369
00:33:41,373 --> 00:33:42,806
can you roll over?

370
00:33:44,829 --> 00:33:45,989
Beg?

371
00:33:51,261 --> 00:33:52,751
Frak you.

372
00:33:58,813 --> 00:34:00,007
You're not my type.

373
00:34:27,325 --> 00:34:30,817
FISK: And she died knowing that
her ship and her crew were safe,

374
00:34:31,581 --> 00:34:33,776
and that her mission
had been accomplished.

375
00:34:35,133 --> 00:34:39,001
Nothing was more important to her than
her ship, her crew, and her mission.

376
00:34:41,117 --> 00:34:45,019
<i>And as I take command of Pegasus,
I pledge to uphold those values</i>

377
00:34:45,533 --> 00:34:49,094
that made her such an
effective and heroic leader.

378
00:34:59,965 --> 00:35:03,162
I only knew Adm. Cain for a short time.

379
00:35:03,197 --> 00:35:05,927
So what I have to say
about her will be short.

380
00:35:07,709 --> 00:35:09,438
She faced things.

381
00:35:09,693 --> 00:35:13,026
She looked them right in the
eye and she didn't flinch.

382
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:17,247
That's something that
we do a lot around here.

383
00:35:18,237 --> 00:35:21,263
We second guess.
We worry.

384
00:35:22,173 --> 00:35:25,006
When I think about what she
went through after the attack...

385
00:35:25,245 --> 00:35:26,507
All alone,

386
00:35:27,612 --> 00:35:29,671
one ship, no help,

387
00:35:31,037 --> 00:35:32,299
no hope...

388
00:35:34,205 --> 00:35:35,672
She didn't give up.

389
00:35:37,341 --> 00:35:38,672
She didn't worry.

390
00:35:38,685 --> 00:35:41,950
She didn't second guess.
She acted.

391
00:35:42,589 --> 00:35:45,251
She did what she thought
needed to be done,

392
00:35:45,286 --> 00:35:46,908
<i>and the Pegasus survived.</i>

393
00:35:49,917 --> 00:35:51,885
It might be hard to admit,

394
00:35:53,501 --> 00:35:55,025
or hard to hear,

395
00:35:55,229 --> 00:35:58,995
but I think that
we were safer with her

396
00:36:00,061 --> 00:36:01,323
than we are without.

397
00:36:18,397 --> 00:36:19,421
STARBUCK: Lee.

398
00:36:21,628 --> 00:36:22,890
Lee, you okay?

399
00:36:25,212 --> 00:36:26,577
Are you okay?

400
00:36:27,677 --> 00:36:29,668
No. Not really.

401
00:36:35,133 --> 00:36:36,225
Hey...

402
00:36:37,725 --> 00:36:39,625
I broke my word to you.

403
00:36:39,933 --> 00:36:41,195
What are you
talking about?

404
00:36:41,213 --> 00:36:42,475
I let you down.

405
00:36:43,037 --> 00:36:44,732
I wasn't there
when you needed me.

406
00:36:45,085 --> 00:36:46,074
Look,

407
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,834
a close call like that...

408
00:36:51,549 --> 00:36:53,847
That'd mess
with anybody's head.

409
00:36:55,805 --> 00:36:56,965
All right?

410
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:03,549
It turns out I didn't
need you anyway, so...

411
00:37:06,813 --> 00:37:09,475
Let's just be glad that we
both came back alive, all right?

412
00:37:10,653 --> 00:37:12,450
That's just it, Kara.

413
00:37:15,773 --> 00:37:18,037
I didn't want to
make it back alive.

414
00:38:00,701 --> 00:38:03,226
<i>(SOBBING) I didn't think
I'd ever see you again.</i>

415
00:38:05,373 --> 00:38:06,772
<i>Same here.</i>

416
00:38:14,652 --> 00:38:15,778
<i>BOOMER: So,</i>

417
00:38:16,828 --> 00:38:18,352
<i>where do we go from here?</i>

418
00:38:30,653 --> 00:38:33,213
ROSLIN: So, how did the Cylon

419
00:38:34,012 --> 00:38:37,004
<i>manage to get off
the Pegasus undetected?</i>

420
00:38:37,852 --> 00:38:39,183
No one really knows.

421
00:38:39,772 --> 00:38:42,570
There was so much chaos in
the aftermath of the attack.

422
00:38:43,708 --> 00:38:47,144
Thank the gods that you did
not have to do what I advised.

423
00:38:47,179 --> 00:38:48,798
That makes me
very happy.

424
00:38:49,501 --> 00:38:51,662
Yes. Thank the gods.

425
00:38:52,604 --> 00:38:54,094
How are you feeling?

426
00:38:55,421 --> 00:38:58,549
Well, I could sleep
for about a year, but...

427
00:39:00,445 --> 00:39:02,242
But you, however,

428
00:39:02,781 --> 00:39:06,273
do not have that luxury
because you have a new job.

429
00:39:07,293 --> 00:39:08,282
Billy?

430
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:12,909
It took a little while
to find that jeweler.

431
00:39:12,944 --> 00:39:13,882
Thank you.

432
00:39:18,524 --> 00:39:23,393
Rumor has it that I know very
little about military protocol,

433
00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:25,018
but I do believe

434
00:39:25,053 --> 00:39:29,490
that someone who commands
more than one ship

435
00:39:29,525 --> 00:39:31,204
is called an Admiral.

436
00:39:42,205 --> 00:39:44,400
Congratulations,
Adm. Adama.

437
00:39:50,364 --> 00:39:52,127
Thank you, Madam President.

438
00:39:54,269 --> 00:39:55,861
Thank you, Billy.

439
00:39:58,013 --> 00:39:59,802
I never gave up hope.

440
00:39:59,837 --> 00:40:03,273
I just stopped trying
to get these a long time ago.

441
00:40:04,573 --> 00:40:06,598
Just goes to show you, Bill,

442
00:40:07,069 --> 00:40:08,832
never give up hope.

443
00:40:09,693 --> 00:40:11,684
Same goes for you, Laura.

444
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,369
Hmm.

445
00:40:16,124 --> 00:40:17,318
All right.
