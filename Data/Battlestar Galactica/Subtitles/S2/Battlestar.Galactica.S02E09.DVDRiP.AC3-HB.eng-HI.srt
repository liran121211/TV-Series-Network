We networked the FTL computer with

Once they're linked, we'll only need
10 minutes to complete the calculations.

It's the virus, sir.

I think it must have spawned copies of
itself in some other computer systems.

Get back to work.

176
00:12:24,871 --> 00:12:26,463
That's an order.

[Clears throat]

178
00:13:05,671 --> 00:13:07,639
How much time do I have?

179
00:13:08,392 --> 00:13:10,792
Weeks. A month at the outside.

180
00:13:26,824 --> 00:13:28,689
Will I be able to work?

181
00:13:28,711 --> 00:13:31,737
Unless the cancer goes to
your brain. If that happens...

182
00:13:35,431 --> 00:13:36,830
[gun firing]

183
00:13:45,607 --> 00:13:47,700
Someone's a tad aggressive.

184
00:13:48,135 --> 00:13:50,035
Just shut up and shoot.

185
00:13:50,599 --> 00:13:53,898
My gods, between you
and Racetrack, it's like...

186
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,980
Having a conversation is like
walking through a minefield.

187
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:01,998
And you're the last person who
should be lecturing me about manners.

188
00:14:04,391 --> 00:14:07,121
From what I hear, you've also been
riding Chief Tyrol pretty good.

189
00:14:07,156 --> 00:14:08,103
Press it.

190
00:14:08,135 --> 00:14:09,602
[Machine buzzing]

191
00:14:10,471 --> 00:14:13,235
I just reminded him that I
expect Viper maintenance...

192
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:16,991
to take precedence
over his hobby project.

193
00:14:17,063 --> 00:14:18,826
(Starbuck)
Nice.

194
00:14:19,207 --> 00:14:22,074
I'm surprised he didn't take
a swing at you.

195
00:14:22,109 --> 00:14:23,684
Come on, Starbuck.

196
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:27,508
You don't actually think that piece
of junk's gonna actually fly, do you?

00:14:31,527 --> 00:14:32,994
[Guns firing]

198
00:14:33,928 --> 00:14:35,876
Fifty cubits says
he gets it in the air.

199
00:14:35,911 --> 00:14:39,176
Yeah? And who's gonna fly it?
It's not gonna be me.

200
00:14:39,207 --> 00:14:42,404
Don't look at me! (Apollo)
I wasn't looking at you.

201
00:14:45,735 --> 00:14:46,827
What?

202
00:14:49,095 --> 00:14:50,494
I'll fly it.

203
00:14:51,687 --> 00:14:53,086
I'll fly it.

204
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:56,745
You?

205
00:14:57,351 --> 00:14:58,375
Me.

206
00:14:59,047 --> 00:15:00,105
Why?

207
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:04,591
Because while everyone else
is standing around whining...

208
00:15:04,615 --> 00:15:05,741
(Apollo)
We're whining?

209
00:15:05,767 --> 00:15:08,964
...the Chief
is doing something positive.

210
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:11,664
I'm deeply moved.
Really?

211
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:12,952
Honestly, I am.

212
00:15:12,967 --> 00:15:14,366

[Apollo laughing]

214
00:15:29,223 --> 00:15:30,884
His lips are blue!

215
00:15:32,136 --> 00:15:34,570
[Whispering]
You look like a blueberry.

216
00:15:34,605 --> 00:15:36,560
There's no oxygen in here.

217
00:15:36,999 --> 00:15:39,832
There's no oxygen in here.
No oxygen.

[Both gasping]

223
00:17:05,767 --> 00:17:07,098
Nice shot.

224
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:08,703
[Alarm sounding]

225
00:17:11,303 --> 00:17:14,830
The environmental computer decided that
the firing range was over pressurized...

226
00:17:14,865 --> 00:17:16,699
and started bleeding out air
to compensate.

227
00:17:16,734 --> 00:17:18,534
Two more minutes,
we may have been dead.

228
00:17:18,535 --> 00:17:22,130
Power fluctuations.
Equipment failures.

229
00:17:22,247 --> 00:17:25,045
Sir, I think I've found
what's causing it.

230
00:17:26,023 --> 00:17:28,321
What is that? (Baltar)
A Cylon logic bomb.

231
00:17:29,031 --> 00:17:30,862
A heuristic computer virus.

232
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:33,938
It's capable of learning,
evolving.

233
00:17:33,973 --> 00:17:35,709
It's probably running
in parallel...

234
00:17:35,719 --> 00:17:37,653
with every computer
in the ship, right now...

235
00:17:37,688 --> 00:17:39,607
just waiting to be activated.

236
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,491
No doubt left behind...

237
00:17:41,735 --> 00:17:45,364
when the Cylons infiltrated
the network Col. Tigh set up...

238
00:17:45,543 --> 00:17:47,272
the day you were shot, sir.

239
00:17:47,307 --> 00:17:49,000
That was weeks ago.

240
00:17:49,991 --> 00:17:51,219
Why now?

241
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:53,737
Most likely, sir, it took
that long for it to crack...

242
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:55,428
our encrypted pass-codes.

243
00:17:55,463 --> 00:17:59,456
And once that happened, it started
testing its ability to control our systems.

244
00:17:59,491 --> 00:18:01,392
Electrical, environmental.

245
00:18:01,511 --> 00:18:03,240
How do you kill it?

246
00:18:04,455 --> 00:18:05,854
Well, that's the tricky part.

247
00:18:05,863 --> 00:18:10,562
If it's a Cylon virus, it is
extremely difficult to eradicate.

248
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:13,410
Well, I guess
I'm pretty lucky then.

249
00:18:14,471 --> 00:18:16,803
Because I have
an expert onboard.

250
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:20,026
Tell Helo to run this past
our prisoner.

Come on. Come on.

254
00:18:33,575 --> 00:18:35,202
For frak's sakes.

255
00:18:36,071 --> 00:18:37,595
Son of a bitch!

[Machine humming]

258
00:18:49,415 --> 00:18:51,172
I got it. Go back to work.

259
00:18:51,207 --> 00:18:54,734
It's a two-man job, Chief.
You want this wing up or not?

260
00:19:02,215 --> 00:19:04,206
On three.
One, two, three.

261
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:12,986
(Tyrol) Great. Great, hold
it there. Pull it that way.

262
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,744
Sir, we're continuing
to experience power spikes...

263
00:19:22,779 --> 00:19:25,323
and equipment failures
across the ship. Thank you.

264
00:19:25,863 --> 00:19:27,588
We'd better up
our alert status...

265
00:19:27,623 --> 00:19:30,148
and put our damage control
teams on standby.

266
00:19:30,183 --> 00:19:31,346
Not yet.

267
00:19:34,695 --> 00:19:37,028
Have you seen the ship
that the Chief is building?

268
00:19:37,063 --> 00:19:40,328
His imaginary fighter? I don't need
to see it. I know it's a waste of time.

269
00:19:40,363 --> 00:19:41,988
The deck crew doesn't seem
to think so.

270
00:19:42,023 --> 00:19:44,491
We need to focus on the fleet
we've got left...

271
00:19:44,526 --> 00:19:46,500
not get bogged down
in some pipe dream.

272
00:19:46,535 --> 00:19:49,561
You should shut it down.
It may come to that.

273
00:19:50,727 --> 00:19:52,612
This project,
it's giving them something.

274
00:19:52,647 --> 00:19:55,741
I'm not going to take
that away until I have to.

[Men chattering]

276
00:19:57,447 --> 00:20:00,439

feel like hitting something.

Okay. Don't square up.
Don't square up.

278

if you want to throw them...

I'll be you.

Head in a lock, grab the
wrist, secure the arm...

284
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:25,250
and I'm just gonna drop
the knee, rotate 45. Okay.

Are you all right?
Yeah.

287
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:32,688
Just like we did in basic.

into the mix.

onboard? I just arrived.

<i>For what?</i>

313

its course in a matter of hours.

Well, I hate to say it, but you've
got the cockpit too far back.

You're gonna run into CG
problems when you maneuver.

326
00:22:57,255 --> 00:23:00,713
We're not going for maneuverability,
Captain. We're going for speed.

Besides, you didn't think
this thing would fly anyway.

00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,831
I'm scrounging most of
what I can from the fleet.

349
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:55,847
But I need engines.

350
00:23:55,879 --> 00:23:57,676
I know I need
Cmdr. Adama's permission...

351
00:23:57,711 --> 00:23:59,297
to cannibalize
one of the wrecks.

352
00:23:59,303 --> 00:24:02,966
Engines or not, we both know that piece
of crap out there is never going to fly.

353
00:24:03,001 --> 00:24:05,082
I gotta try, Colonel.

354
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:06,786
What's the point?

355
00:24:07,143 --> 00:24:10,579
Because that ship, the work,
that's all I've got left.

356
00:24:11,271 --> 00:24:12,795
I don't have that, I...

357
00:24:20,646 --> 00:24:22,170
[tap squeaking]

358
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:27,620
<i>I almost forgot. I promised the XO
of the Baah Pakal I'd help him out.</i>

359
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:33,100
Sir? He's got some
obsolete DDG-62 engines...

360
00:24:33,135 --> 00:24:36,004
that's taking up space
on his flight deck.

361
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:39,202
They're probably crap but I told him
that I would have a crew in there...

362
00:24:39,237 --> 00:24:41,667
to haul them out
as soon as possible.

363
00:24:42,182 --> 00:24:44,377
Glad to be of help, sir.
Good.

364
00:24:55,974 --> 00:24:59,341
Madam President, your
shuttle's ready. Of course.

365
00:25:00,391 --> 00:25:03,485
Thank you again for letting
me use your quarters.

366
00:25:03,527 --> 00:25:04,721
Please.

367
00:25:06,567 --> 00:25:08,535
I wanted to return this.

368
00:25:10,407 --> 00:25:11,931
This was a gift.

369
00:25:11,942 --> 00:25:13,731
"Never lend a book," I know.

370
00:25:13,766 --> 00:25:17,497
But I've had it far too long.
It belongs in your collection.

371
00:25:20,199 --> 00:25:22,633
I'm late for a quorum meeting.

372
00:25:24,934 --> 00:25:26,663
Is there a problem?

373
00:25:27,623 --> 00:25:30,888
Our computers have been
infected by a Cylon virus...

374
00:25:30,923 --> 00:25:33,451
corrupting systems
throughout the entire ship.

375
00:25:33,486 --> 00:25:35,980
I've just been notified
that this is a prelude...

376
00:25:36,015 --> 00:25:38,376
to an all-out attack
by the Cylons.

377
00:25:48,711 --> 00:25:50,980
I assume you've tried
to disable it.

378
00:25:51,015 --> 00:25:54,746
Mr. Gaeta and the Vice President
are handling that right now.

379
00:25:54,781 --> 00:25:56,255
I'm not hopeful.

380
00:25:56,423 --> 00:26:00,917
Commander, I'm not sure what I can
offer you here besides my moral support.

381
00:26:01,158 --> 00:26:03,285
Actually, Madam President...

382
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,198
I could use your advice.

383
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,066
You want to what?

384
00:26:08,295 --> 00:26:10,070
Completely erase
our computer drives...

385
00:26:10,105 --> 00:26:11,845
cold restart
the entire ship's system...

386
00:26:11,847 --> 00:26:13,828
and then restore them
using our prewar backups.

387
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:16,423
Leaving us with our pants down
until we're back online.

388
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:18,052
The Commander
will never go for this.

389
00:26:18,055 --> 00:26:19,420
I've already spoken to him,
sir.

390
00:26:19,431 --> 00:26:21,243
What did he say?
He's considering it.

391
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:23,012
It's the only way
to destroy the virus.

392
00:26:23,047 --> 00:26:25,084
I thought the Commander
told you to stay out of this.

393
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:27,076
I'm sorry, do you want to
survive this one or not?

394
00:26:27,111 --> 00:26:30,740
All right, so we calculate a jump and get
some distance on these Cylon bastards...

395
00:26:30,775 --> 00:26:32,892
No, sir,
we can't risk a jump.

396
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:35,559
All of our systems are
compromised, including navigation.

397
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,392
The virus could drop us
in the middle of a sun.

398
00:26:37,427 --> 00:26:38,576
We're running out of time.

399
00:26:38,598 --> 00:26:40,739
Our signal's gonna catch up
with the Cylon fleet.

400
00:26:40,774 --> 00:26:42,881
If we haven't come up
with anything before then...

401
00:26:42,916 --> 00:26:44,924
They'll take control
of all of our systems...

402
00:26:44,959 --> 00:26:46,933
and then they'll have
a hundred ways to kill us.

403
00:26:46,951 --> 00:26:51,684
I've just come from
seeing our Cylon prisoner.

404
00:26:52,167 --> 00:26:55,466
She's offering a possible
solution to the problem.

405
00:26:56,647 --> 00:26:58,615
And you're wondering
if you can trust her.

406
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,725
It took everything I have...

407
00:27:01,382 --> 00:27:04,442
not to put my hands
around her throat.

408
00:27:06,246 --> 00:27:08,740
I can't believe
I'm contemplating this.

409
00:27:08,775 --> 00:27:11,972
We both know the Cylons
are experts at manipulation.

410
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:14,641
They will do anything
to confuse you.

411
00:27:15,143 --> 00:27:17,219
This is not the one
who shot me.

412
00:27:17,254 --> 00:27:20,451
Can they really be that
different from one another?

413
00:27:22,054 --> 00:27:23,521
Commander,
if you're asking me...

414
00:27:23,526 --> 00:27:26,274
if it's possible that your
judgment's been clouded...

415
00:27:26,309 --> 00:27:29,022
by your history with this
particular Cylon model...

416
00:27:29,057 --> 00:27:30,762
I'd have to say yes.

417
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:32,079
But...

418
00:27:34,311 --> 00:27:35,903
we created them.

419
00:27:37,446 --> 00:27:41,007
There's always a chance
we might find common ground.

423

your father's pocketknife?

424
00:28:56,774 --> 00:28:58,298
Give it to her.

425
00:29:05,126 --> 00:29:08,254
Mr. Gaeta, can you set me up
with a fiber-optic comm link?

426
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:09,859
I need broadcast
to all frequencies...

427
00:29:09,862 --> 00:29:11,625

to the mainframe.

428

00:35:22,566 --> 00:35:24,591
<i>(Dualla)
Blackbird is away.</i>

520
00:35:37,958 --> 00:35:40,358
<i>Will you take it easy?
Start slow.</i>

521
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:44,008
<i>You're testing the ship. It's
not about the pilot showing off.</i>

522
00:35:44,043 --> 00:35:45,534
<i>(Starbuck)
Who's showing off?</i>

523
00:35:45,542 --> 00:35:49,014
<i>(Apollo) Gods damn it, what is
this? What are you trying to prove?</i>

524
00:35:49,049 --> 00:35:52,486
<i>I'm not trying to prove anything.
You've got to be kidding me.</i>

525
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:58,777
<i>[Whooping]</i>

526
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:00,761
<i>Oh, lords.</i>

527
00:36:01,414 --> 00:36:04,645
<i>Okay. Let's see
what this baby can do.</i>

528
00:36:04,966 --> 00:36:06,228
<i>[Panting]</i>

529
00:36:07,014 --> 00:36:08,743
<i>[Starbuck whooping]</i>

530
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:20,067
<i>(Apollo)
Starbuck, where are you?</i>

531
00:36:20,102 --> 00:36:22,284
<i>Starbuck, do you hear me?
Starbuck!</i>

532
00:36:22,319 --> 00:36:24,467
<i>(man) I'm not... She's gone!</i>

533
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:27,181
<i>Galactica, Apollo.
I've lost her.</i>

534
00:36:27,216 --> 00:36:28,664
<i>I've lost her.</i>

535
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:32,655
<i>(Dualla)
No dradis contact.</i>

536
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:37,173
(Apollo)
Starbuck, where are you?

537
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:38,755
<i>Starbuck, come in.</i>

538
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:40,687
<i>Starbuck, do you read?</i>

539
00:36:43,014 --> 00:36:44,641
<i>Kara, are you okay?</i>

540
00:36:55,526 --> 00:36:59,018
Of course, you lost contact. It's
a damn stealth ship, remember?

541
00:36:59,053 --> 00:37:00,281
<i>Oh, you...</i>

542
00:37:00,294 --> 00:37:02,023
<i>[Starbuck and Apollo laughing]</i>

543
00:37:02,058 --> 00:37:03,512
[All clapping]

544
00:37:13,797 --> 00:37:15,458
(officer)
Commander on deck.

545
00:37:16,294 --> 00:37:17,693
As you were.

546
00:37:22,022 --> 00:37:23,421
Chief Tyrol?

547
00:37:26,438 --> 00:37:28,099
This is the Blackbird?

548
00:37:28,101 --> 00:37:31,264
Yes, ma'am. Madam
President, this is an honor.

549
00:37:31,299 --> 00:37:34,505
No, the honor's mine.
It's remarkable.

550
00:37:35,781 --> 00:37:37,305
Just a ship, ma'am.

551
00:37:37,318 --> 00:37:39,331
(Laura)
You're much too modest.

552
00:37:39,366 --> 00:37:41,344
After what
we've been through...

553
00:37:41,958 --> 00:37:45,826
it would be very easy
to give up, to lose hope.

554
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:49,711
But not here. Not today.

555
00:37:50,022 --> 00:37:53,549
This is more than a ship,
Chief. This is an act of faith.

556
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:58,048
It is proof that despite
all we've lost...

557
00:37:59,302 --> 00:38:00,826
we keep trying.

558
00:38:02,022 --> 00:38:06,322
And we will get through this,
all of us, together.

559
00:38:06,566 --> 00:38:07,897
I promise.

560
00:38:11,878 --> 00:38:13,209
Commander.

561
00:38:19,814 --> 00:38:20,906
Ahem,

562
00:38:21,957 --> 00:38:23,618
Madam President...

563
00:38:23,814 --> 00:38:27,306
this was supposed to be
a surprise...

564
00:38:29,222 --> 00:38:30,553
but, well.

565
00:38:48,645 --> 00:38:49,976
Thank you.

566
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:53,520
If you'll do us the honors,
Madam President.

567
00:38:53,555 --> 00:38:54,809
Of Course.

568
00:38:56,069 --> 00:38:57,161
Okay.

569
00:39:02,277 --> 00:39:03,539
[Gasping]

570
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:05,217
[People laughing]

571
00:39:05,734 --> 00:39:06,962
Kidding.

572
00:39:28,357 --> 00:39:31,087
Hell of an idea,
using carbon composites.

573
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:38,066
(man)
It was a good job.

574
00:39:40,422 --> 00:39:41,719
Nice work.

575
00:39:48,294 --> 00:39:49,886
That was lovely.

576
00:39:51,526 --> 00:39:54,461
They wanted to do that
for you. Thank you.

577
00:39:56,966 --> 00:40:01,198
None of this would have been possible
if you hadn't trusted the Cylon.

578
00:40:02,982 --> 00:40:06,975
I took your advice,
met on common ground.

579
00:40:08,486 --> 00:40:09,976
What was that?

580
00:40:12,165 --> 00:40:14,065
We both wanted to live.
