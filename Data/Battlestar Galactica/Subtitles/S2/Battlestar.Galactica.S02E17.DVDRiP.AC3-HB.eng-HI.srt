NARRATOR: <i>Previously on</i>
Battlestar Galactica.

00:00:22,537 --> 00:00:23,890
(GUN FIRING)

3
00:00:30,577 --> 00:00:33,887
Lee, you can't leave.
You have to stay.

4
00:00:34,137 --> 00:00:35,855
You have to really stay.

5
00:00:36,217 --> 00:00:39,687
GINA: You must betray Roslin and run
for President in the upcoming election.

6
00:00:40,377 --> 00:00:42,413
I know it's hard, but it's the only way.

7
00:00:42,617 --> 00:00:45,495
Word of Fisk's murder has spread out
through the entire fleet.

8
00:00:45,577 --> 00:00:47,533
A crew can fall apart when
their commander is killed.

9
00:00:47,617 --> 00:00:49,892
The <i>Pegasus</i> lost two in a matter of weeks.

10
00:00:49,977 --> 00:00:51,649
I'm putting Garner in command.

11
00:00:51,737 --> 00:00:53,887
But he's an engineer, not a command officer.

12
00:00:53,977 --> 00:00:55,205
He's the best they got.

13
00:01:11,417 --> 00:01:13,487
Pegasus, <i>Buster.</i>

14
00:01:13,577 --> 00:01:16,137
Dradis intercept training birds are away.

HOSHl: <i>Buster,</i> Pegasus. <i>Roger that.</i>
<i>Take station as briefed.</i>

Be advised communications will suffer

17
00:01:20,617 --> 00:01:24,007
sporadic interruptions due to
stellar EMI activity, acknowledge.

18
00:01:24,097 --> 00:01:27,373
BUSTER: Pegasus, <i>Buster.</i>
<i>Acknowledge. Our communications suck.</i>

19
00:01:27,537 --> 00:01:28,890
It's gonna be like this all day?

20
00:01:28,977 --> 00:01:30,046
Big time.

21
00:01:30,137 --> 00:01:33,334
Those binaries are putting out so much EMI,
even the dradis is barely working.

22
00:01:33,417 --> 00:01:36,409
Well, I'm gonna put a little distance
between us and the fleet.

23
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:40,172
Get us out of this soup, see if we can get
a cleaner dradis picture.

24
00:01:47,417 --> 00:01:48,452
Hey!

25
00:01:48,537 --> 00:01:50,971
Whoever's in there, time's up!
Let's go! Come on!

26
00:01:51,217 --> 00:01:53,572
Got a couple of tired Viper jockeys out here
who want to sleep.

27
00:01:53,657 --> 00:01:55,375
Go hit the showers, Duck.

28
00:01:55,457 --> 00:01:57,891
We'll be gone by the time you get back.

29
00:01:57,977 --> 00:01:59,012
(GROANING)

30
00:02:02,577 --> 00:02:03,612
How you feel?

31
00:02:03,737 --> 00:02:05,455
Oh, not great.

32
00:02:07,217 --> 00:02:08,935
But Cottle's given me the thumbs-up,

33
00:02:09,017 --> 00:02:11,485
and it's been almost a month,
so I guess it's back to work.

34
00:02:11,577 --> 00:02:14,410
So you ready to go into
the belly of The Beast?

35
00:02:14,497 --> 00:02:15,896
- The Beast?
- Yeah.

36
00:02:15,977 --> 00:02:17,933
That's what they call the <i>Pegasus</i> now.

37
00:02:18,017 --> 00:02:19,245
<i>Galactica's</i> The Bucket.

38
00:02:19,337 --> 00:02:20,452
(BOTH LAUGHING)

39
00:02:20,537 --> 00:02:22,493
The Bucket and The Beast.

40
00:02:22,857 --> 00:02:23,846
Huh.

41
00:02:25,257 --> 00:02:27,009
Don't we make a pair?

42
00:02:28,217 --> 00:02:30,333
- Come on.
- No, you come on.

43
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:31,406
Come on, come on, go.

44
00:02:32,977 --> 00:02:35,172
Anyway, it's only a temporary assignment.

45
00:02:36,377 --> 00:02:38,937
I should be back again in a couple of weeks.

46
00:02:39,897 --> 00:02:41,615
Why'd the old man pick you?

47
00:02:41,697 --> 00:02:43,653
One word, Starbuck.

48
00:02:43,857 --> 00:02:44,926
Is she in hack again?

49
00:02:45,017 --> 00:02:46,132
(CHUCKLING)

50
00:02:46,497 --> 00:02:47,725
Not yet.

51
00:02:47,937 --> 00:02:50,167
But apparently she's been
driving Commander Garner

52
00:02:50,257 --> 00:02:53,772
up one bulkhead and down the other
ever since she took over flight training on,

53
00:02:53,977 --> 00:02:56,172
what did you call it?
The Beast.

54
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,249
And since I won't be flying combat
for a while, I...

55
00:03:00,657 --> 00:03:01,692
APOLLO: Oh.

56
00:03:05,777 --> 00:03:07,813
Were you gonna mention these?

57
00:03:08,057 --> 00:03:10,446
Oh, yeah.
I got promoted to Major.

58
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:14,047
Well, don't sound so happy.

59
00:03:14,137 --> 00:03:15,456
Doesn't mean much.

60
00:03:15,537 --> 00:03:16,936
I think it means a lot.

61
00:03:17,177 --> 00:03:20,487
Oh, well, if you say so, then it must be true.

62
00:03:24,297 --> 00:03:25,332
(MOANING)

63
00:03:26,337 --> 00:03:27,406
TYROL: So what's going on?

64
00:03:27,497 --> 00:03:30,534
We were unloading one of the containers
and then one of the crates shifted.

65
00:03:31,337 --> 00:03:34,056
So we looked inside and we saw that
something was moving.

66
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:35,372
Did you call it in?

67
00:03:35,457 --> 00:03:38,051
Yeah. We shut the door
and the Marines are on their way.

68
00:03:38,537 --> 00:03:40,095
Give me a light.

69
00:03:45,537 --> 00:03:47,334
Chief, we don't know what
we're dealing with here.

70
00:03:47,417 --> 00:03:48,486
Don't you think we should wait?

71
00:03:50,057 --> 00:03:51,376
Just wait out here.

72
00:03:51,457 --> 00:03:52,492
Chief?

73
00:04:36,937 --> 00:04:38,495
Is this the <i>Galactica?</i>

74
00:04:40,177 --> 00:04:41,292
Yeah.

75
00:04:43,137 --> 00:04:44,968
Are you Doctor Cottle?

76
00:04:53,097 --> 00:04:55,247
(DISTORTED CHATTERING OVER RADIO)

77
00:04:56,977 --> 00:04:58,695
What the hell was that?

78
00:04:58,777 --> 00:05:00,449
I don't know.
We should call it in.

79
00:05:00,537 --> 00:05:02,255
I'm gonna spin up the FTL drive just in case.

80
00:05:02,337 --> 00:05:04,214
LYLA: <i>Pegasus,</i> this is Raptor 718.

81
00:05:04,457 --> 00:05:06,766
(DISTORTED CHATTERING OVER RADIO)

82
00:05:06,857 --> 00:05:08,370
Say again, Shark.

83
00:05:13,057 --> 00:05:15,332
Shark, repeat your last.
Did you declare an emergency?

84
00:05:16,537 --> 00:05:18,289
Buster, Shark, do you read?

85
00:05:19,297 --> 00:05:21,447
Shark, repeat your last.
Did you declare an emergency?

86
00:05:21,537 --> 00:05:23,448
OFFICER: Commander Garner on deck.

87
00:05:23,537 --> 00:05:25,129
Buster, Shark, do you read?

88
00:05:26,137 --> 00:05:27,172
What have you got, Mr Hoshi?

89
00:05:27,257 --> 00:05:28,326
Not sure, sir.

90
00:05:28,417 --> 00:05:30,248
I think Buster and Shark are declaring
an emergency,

91
00:05:30,337 --> 00:05:32,134
but their transmission's garbled.

92
00:05:38,777 --> 00:05:40,096
We've lost them, sir.

93
00:06:33,617 --> 00:06:34,652
OFFICER 1: I want us to recheck that.

94
00:06:34,737 --> 00:06:37,535
OFFICER 2: Okay, I need to check if
we're getting some readouts on the problem.

95
00:06:37,617 --> 00:06:39,175
Yeah? All right, I'll check again.

96
00:06:41,497 --> 00:06:43,408
Welcome aboard, Major.

97
00:06:45,257 --> 00:06:47,168
I didn't expect a welcoming committee.

98
00:06:47,257 --> 00:06:50,135
Don't flatter yourself.
I was in the neighbourhood.

99
00:06:50,537 --> 00:06:51,606
Major Adama, sir.

100
00:06:51,697 --> 00:06:52,686
Major Adama.

101
00:06:53,337 --> 00:06:54,372
Commander Garner.

102
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:57,654
Glad to see you, Major, although I wish
it was under better circumstances.

103
00:06:57,737 --> 00:07:01,252
We have just lost contact with two
of our Raptors out on a training mission.

104
00:07:01,377 --> 00:07:02,856
What? When did that happen?

105
00:07:02,937 --> 00:07:05,895
Captain Thrace, perhaps if you were actually
down on the flight deck

106
00:07:05,977 --> 00:07:07,126
and monitoring your Raptors,

107
00:07:07,217 --> 00:07:09,412
the way any training officer
worth a damn would have done,

108
00:07:09,497 --> 00:07:11,727
you would know that four
of our pilots were missing.

109
00:07:12,417 --> 00:07:13,486
Major.

110
00:07:15,697 --> 00:07:17,289
You with me, Major?

111
00:07:17,377 --> 00:07:18,366
Yes, sir.

112
00:07:18,457 --> 00:07:21,893
They disappeared from the dradis
about an hour ago. They're gone.

113
00:07:26,097 --> 00:07:27,655
Shut the hell up!

114
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:32,287
We lose two Raptors in a training mission,

115
00:07:32,377 --> 00:07:35,335
and I only find out when the Commander
throws it in my face?

116
00:07:39,977 --> 00:07:40,966
Don't all speak at once.

117
00:07:41,057 --> 00:07:44,766
Sir, it's been made clear that discussing
flight deck situations

118
00:07:44,857 --> 00:07:47,974
with anyone outside <i>Pegasus</i> crew
is not allowed.

119
00:07:48,137 --> 00:07:49,252
Sorry, sir.

120
00:07:50,657 --> 00:07:52,966
And whose frakking bright idea was that?

121
00:07:58,457 --> 00:07:59,651
It was Garner, wasn't it?

122
00:08:01,817 --> 00:08:03,170
STARBUCK: Of course it was.

123
00:08:03,737 --> 00:08:06,205
So barely competent and paranoid.

124
00:08:06,897 --> 00:08:07,886
Huh.

125
00:08:08,097 --> 00:08:10,008
There's a hell of a combination.

126
00:08:10,417 --> 00:08:11,930
I've a problem.

127
00:08:12,177 --> 00:08:14,054
That problem's name is Kara Thrace.

128
00:08:15,097 --> 00:08:17,372
I know how to handle her, sir.

129
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:21,329
And for the record,
she is one hell of a Viper pilot.

130
00:08:21,937 --> 00:08:24,531
What, I should cut her some slack
because she's good in the cockpit,

131
00:08:24,617 --> 00:08:26,209
is that what you're saying?

132
00:08:27,097 --> 00:08:30,373
Because nobody ever cut us
any slack in the engine room.

133
00:08:30,817 --> 00:08:32,694
I can tell you that right now.

134
00:08:33,537 --> 00:08:38,008
But then, I don't know, maybe being a snipe
is different than being a Viper jockey.

135
00:08:38,777 --> 00:08:40,415
No flashy stunts for us.

136
00:08:40,497 --> 00:08:42,806
No flying by the seat of our pants
down there.

137
00:08:43,977 --> 00:08:46,093
The engine room is like a finely-tuned watch,

138
00:08:46,177 --> 00:08:48,771
and everything in it needs to be monitored
and maintained

139
00:08:48,857 --> 00:08:51,132
in a very precise fashion.

140
00:08:51,737 --> 00:08:53,409
Nobody freelances.

141
00:08:54,257 --> 00:08:56,851
Everything is done in the proper way,
at the proper time,

142
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:58,655
in the proper order.

143
00:08:58,897 --> 00:09:01,491
Or there'd be no power, no lights,

144
00:09:02,097 --> 00:09:04,327
no hot showers for your flyboys.

145
00:09:05,897 --> 00:09:09,207
You know, Major, I think some of the people
around here

146
00:09:10,737 --> 00:09:13,205
could learn a thing or two from the snipes.

147
00:09:20,617 --> 00:09:23,336
I'm sorry, Madam President, but it's that time.

148
00:09:23,937 --> 00:09:24,972
Oh.

149
00:09:25,817 --> 00:09:26,852
The campaign meeting.

150
00:09:26,937 --> 00:09:29,053
Mmm-hmm.
You've been putting it off for weeks.

151
00:09:29,137 --> 00:09:31,776
And we do have a presidential election
coming up,

152
00:09:32,097 --> 00:09:33,894
unless you've decided not to run.

153
00:09:33,977 --> 00:09:35,774
I'm gonna be perfectly honest with you, Tory.

154
00:09:35,857 --> 00:09:37,336
I've thought about it a few times,

155
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:39,169
but, no, I'm still here.

156
00:09:39,257 --> 00:09:40,895
There's so much to do, so

157
00:09:43,337 --> 00:09:45,089
let's talk politics.

158
00:09:45,177 --> 00:09:46,246
Great.

159
00:09:46,937 --> 00:09:50,327
Here are the results
from our first fleet-wide poll.

160
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,248
How did you manage this?

161
00:09:53,337 --> 00:09:56,374
I was precinct captain for the Federalist Party

162
00:09:56,457 --> 00:09:58,527
in Delphi for five years.

163
00:09:59,097 --> 00:10:02,089
We did polls to see what the mayor
should have for lunch.

164
00:10:02,697 --> 00:10:05,291
For what it's worth, you've managed to walk
a very fine line.

165
00:10:05,377 --> 00:10:08,892
Your presidential bid has the support
of both the military and the civilian fleet,

166
00:10:08,977 --> 00:10:10,854
and you've received
enthusiastic endorsements

167
00:10:10,937 --> 00:10:12,495
from the Gemenese religious leaders.

168
00:10:13,057 --> 00:10:16,936
Well, it helps when your only real rival
is a convicted terrorist.

169
00:10:19,617 --> 00:10:22,654
Am I capable of leading this fleet?

170
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,526
Absolutely.

171
00:10:26,297 --> 00:10:29,175
And for a time, I almost had a chance,

172
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:34,575
until Laura Roslin ascended
from politician to prophet.

173
00:10:37,177 --> 00:10:38,929
The truth is, I can't win.

174
00:10:40,617 --> 00:10:41,845
But you could.

175
00:10:43,337 --> 00:10:45,214
You flatter me, Mr Zarek, really,

176
00:10:45,417 --> 00:10:47,373
but I'm not sure I'm cut out
for a life in politics,

177
00:10:47,457 --> 00:10:50,927
as I find the vice-presidency
and everything to do with it very tedious.

178
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:55,887
I would imagine carrying water for Roslin
would get old after a time,

179
00:10:55,977 --> 00:10:59,526
but it's the office that makes you
the perfect candidate, Doctor.

180
00:10:59,897 --> 00:11:01,216
You're pre-sold.

181
00:11:03,017 --> 00:11:04,211
Really?

182
00:11:05,257 --> 00:11:06,372
To whom?

183
00:11:07,817 --> 00:11:11,571
You'd be surprised how many people
crave the assurances of cold science

184
00:11:11,817 --> 00:11:16,129
as opposed to the superstitious ravings
of the Gemenese.

185
00:11:17,417 --> 00:11:19,612
As a scientist, you offer hope.

186
00:11:21,257 --> 00:11:22,326
Think about it.

187
00:11:24,337 --> 00:11:25,736
And you, Tom?

188
00:11:27,657 --> 00:11:29,887
You'll just step aside, will you?

189
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:34,533
I'm just happy to back
a man of true conviction.

190
00:11:35,937 --> 00:11:38,929
A man who remembers his friends.

191
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:46,729
CASE: Attention on deck.

192
00:11:48,297 --> 00:11:49,412
APOLLO: At ease.

193
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:53,092
Where's Stinger?

194
00:11:53,177 --> 00:11:55,486
He's in hack for mouthing off to Garner.

195
00:11:55,577 --> 00:11:57,374
Stepped on his precious little toes.

196
00:11:57,457 --> 00:11:58,526
Frakking Garner.

197
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:00,130
(ALL LAUGHING)

198
00:12:00,217 --> 00:12:01,616
STARBUCK: He's such an idiot.
He's just...

199
00:12:01,737 --> 00:12:03,375
All right, lock that up!

200
00:12:03,817 --> 00:12:05,614
Get something straight.

201
00:12:05,777 --> 00:12:09,486
We got two missing Raptor crews
who are gonna be out of oxygen in 36 hours.

202
00:12:09,577 --> 00:12:11,488
That's all that matters.

203
00:12:11,657 --> 00:12:15,809
So everyone knock off the schoolyard crap
and start doing your frakking jobs.

204
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:20,773
Now, we need to start
thinking outside the box.

205
00:12:21,097 --> 00:12:23,486
Which is supposed to be what you do best.

206
00:12:26,817 --> 00:12:28,170
Sorry, Major.

207
00:12:28,257 --> 00:12:29,372
All right.

208
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:30,606
I wanna know everything there is to know

209
00:12:30,697 --> 00:12:32,255
about these missing Raptors and their crews.

210
00:12:32,337 --> 00:12:35,329
I wanna know personal quirks,
aircraft squawks, wireless transmissions,

211
00:12:35,817 --> 00:12:37,808
anything that might help.

212
00:12:39,457 --> 00:12:41,049
Good. Get to it.

213
00:12:50,777 --> 00:12:51,892
How is she?

214
00:12:51,977 --> 00:12:54,616
Rya's four months pregnant
and doesn't wanna be.

215
00:12:54,697 --> 00:12:58,690
I understand the Gemenese have a problem
with women terminating their pregnancies.

216
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:01,735
Tyrol said that she asked for you by name.

217
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,926
Do you want to tell me
what that's really all about?

218
00:13:06,097 --> 00:13:09,009
Pretty straightforward, really.
I get a note that a girl is on the way,

219
00:13:09,097 --> 00:13:11,691
she arrives, I do my work, and she leaves.

220
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:13,854
I don't ask a lot of questions.

221
00:13:13,937 --> 00:13:15,211
You're gonna start.

222
00:13:16,697 --> 00:13:18,289
I wanna talk to her.

223
00:13:24,857 --> 00:13:26,449
I'm Admiral Adama.

224
00:13:27,617 --> 00:13:29,892
Don't worry, I've just come to talk.

225
00:13:30,177 --> 00:13:33,726
It doesn't matter what you say.
I'm not gonna change my mind.

226
00:13:38,137 --> 00:13:40,446
Your parents are a little worried about you.

227
00:13:41,217 --> 00:13:44,448
They've contacted me through
the Gemenon representative.

228
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:46,690
My parents?

229
00:13:47,497 --> 00:13:48,646
Oh, gods.

230
00:13:51,057 --> 00:13:53,173
Do you have any idea
what they would do to me?

231
00:13:55,657 --> 00:13:58,046
Please, do not send me back.

232
00:14:01,217 --> 00:14:04,607
You're a stowaway aboard a military ship.

233
00:14:04,937 --> 00:14:08,486
COTTLE: Some people might say she was
a victim of political persecution.

234
00:14:08,737 --> 00:14:11,012
Hell, she could apply for asylum.

235
00:14:23,377 --> 00:14:24,526
Asylum.

236
00:14:25,737 --> 00:14:28,695
That's it. I want asylum.

237
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:41,128
Under Gemenon law,
the girl is still the property of her parents,

238
00:14:41,217 --> 00:14:43,936
and they can deal with her once
she's safely back on her ship.

239
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:46,053
To be honest, I'm more concerned

240
00:14:46,137 --> 00:14:47,968
with the broader implications of this matter.

241
00:14:48,057 --> 00:14:48,967
Sarah.

242
00:14:49,057 --> 00:14:50,888
I know you don't wanna hear this,

243
00:14:50,977 --> 00:14:53,889
but my people, my voters,
are demanding action on this issue.

244
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:55,888
We have been through this.

245
00:14:56,057 --> 00:14:58,855
Abortion was legal under Colonial law
before the attacks,

246
00:14:58,937 --> 00:15:00,973
and so it is still legal today.

247
00:15:01,097 --> 00:15:02,530
It's obscene.

248
00:15:03,057 --> 00:15:06,811
The scriptures view abortion
as an abomination in the eyes of the gods.

249
00:15:06,897 --> 00:15:08,296
You cannot equivocate on this point

250
00:15:08,377 --> 00:15:10,732
if you want our support
in the coming election.

251
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:17,967
Rya Kibby's petition
for asylum is under review.

252
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,931
Thank you, Sarah, very much, for coming in.

253
00:15:31,217 --> 00:15:34,687
I'm not turning that girl over.
I'm certainly not banning abortion.

254
00:15:34,937 --> 00:15:36,256
TORY: Then don't.

255
00:15:36,777 --> 00:15:39,575
But we have to move aggressively
on this thing.

256
00:15:39,657 --> 00:15:42,091
I'm gonna arrange a conference call
with you and the Quorum,

257
00:15:42,177 --> 00:15:44,133
or this is gonna get out of hand, fast.

258
00:15:48,457 --> 00:15:50,049
She's not Billy.

259
00:15:50,737 --> 00:15:52,216
No, she's not.

260
00:15:56,857 --> 00:15:58,085
(ADAMA SIGHS)

261
00:16:05,937 --> 00:16:07,006
What?

262
00:16:07,977 --> 00:16:09,569
I hate to say this

263
00:16:12,937 --> 00:16:15,326
because I know that this is a political issue.

264
00:16:16,737 --> 00:16:20,855
The fact is, that number
doesn't go up very often.

265
00:16:35,417 --> 00:16:39,615
I have fought for a woman's right
to control her body my entire career.

266
00:16:40,337 --> 00:16:41,326
No.

267
00:16:42,457 --> 00:16:43,446
No.

268
00:16:43,537 --> 00:16:47,496
I'm just remembering what you said
right after the Cylon attack.

269
00:16:49,857 --> 00:16:52,735
That if we really wanna save the human race,

270
00:16:53,537 --> 00:16:55,653
we better start having babies.

271
00:17:03,137 --> 00:17:05,571
Nothing, nothing, and more nothing.

272
00:17:09,097 --> 00:17:13,090
Where is Shark's last transmission?

273
00:17:13,577 --> 00:17:15,932
Well, there's not much there.

They're in distress.

277
00:17:29,857 --> 00:17:32,655
They give a bearing requesting instructions,

278
00:17:32,777 --> 00:17:34,972
"It's an emergency. Can you read?"

279
00:17:35,497 --> 00:17:38,170
Maybe. But what's this "eve" fragment here?

00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:41,647

284
00:18:00,137 --> 00:18:01,616
Okay. From who?

285
00:18:02,817 --> 00:18:03,852
I don't know.

286
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:06,856
But maybe that's where
they went, to go find out.

287
00:18:08,297 --> 00:18:12,176
APOLLO: Commander, Captain Thrace
has a theory about our missing Raptors, sir.

288
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,691
That's good, considering she lost them.

289
00:18:14,777 --> 00:18:15,892
Excuse me?

290
00:18:15,977 --> 00:18:18,047
Well, they were out on one of your so-called
training missions,

291
00:18:18,137 --> 00:18:19,126
weren't they, Captain?

292
00:18:19,217 --> 00:18:20,889
My "so-called" training missions.

293
00:18:20,977 --> 00:18:22,171
Okay, let's just take this easy.

294
00:18:22,257 --> 00:18:24,691
That's when you're not boozing
or sowing mutiny amongst the crew.

295
00:18:24,777 --> 00:18:25,812
Mutiny.

296
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:27,489
Commander, we should take this
to a private place.

297
00:18:27,577 --> 00:18:30,330
Don't you think I know what's
happening on my own ship?

00:18:31,937 --> 00:18:34,212
"Barely competent and paranoid."

299
00:18:35,977 --> 00:18:38,696
That was off the record.
I was just venting.

300
00:18:39,777 --> 00:18:40,766
Accurately.

301
00:18:40,857 --> 00:18:42,688
I'll have you court-martialed.

302

Commander, I'm not defending
Captain Thrace's behaviour...

303
00:18:45,857 --> 00:18:46,846
Thanks, Major.

304
00:18:46,937 --> 00:18:49,770
Captain Thrace, you're restricted to quarters

305
00:18:49,897 --> 00:18:52,127
until I can ship you back to <i>Galactica.</i>

306
00:18:52,217 --> 00:18:55,175
You're Adama's pet.
Let him deal with you.

307
00:18:59,817 --> 00:19:01,773
- Major?
- Sir.

308
00:19:14,097 --> 00:19:17,214
You've been onboard less than four days
and you're already facing charges.

309
00:19:17,297 --> 00:19:18,696
You don't waste any time, do you?

310
00:19:18,777 --> 00:19:20,290
Neither do you, Lee.

311
00:19:20,377 --> 00:19:22,368
How's it feel being Garner's new playmate?

312
00:19:22,457 --> 00:19:23,890
I'm here to do a job.

313
00:19:23,977 --> 00:19:28,095
Yeah, keep a loudmouth, disobedient,
frak-up Kara Thrace in line.

314
00:19:29,337 --> 00:19:30,850
Not doing such a good job, are you?

315
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:32,336
Evidently not.

316
00:19:33,497 --> 00:19:35,692
We don't have much time,
those guys are running out of air.

317
00:19:35,777 --> 00:19:37,654
Yeah, well, I tried, all right?

318
00:19:38,137 --> 00:19:40,970
All I have done since I got to The Beast
is try and help,

319
00:19:41,057 --> 00:19:43,048
and all I've gotten is Garner's foot in my ass.

320
00:19:43,137 --> 00:19:45,048
Well, maybe you need a kick in the ass!

321
00:19:47,697 --> 00:19:48,925
All right.

322
00:19:49,777 --> 00:19:52,291
Here we go, finally.

323
00:19:52,977 --> 00:19:54,649
What is your problem, anyway?

324
00:19:54,737 --> 00:19:57,854
What's my problem?
What's my problem?

325
00:19:58,377 --> 00:20:01,574
Well, Kara, my problem is you.
You keep frakking up,

326
00:20:01,657 --> 00:20:03,090
and I keep having to clean it up,

327
00:20:03,177 --> 00:20:05,054
and I am officially sick of it.

328
00:20:06,177 --> 00:20:08,407
Poor Lee, your life is so hard, isn't it?

329
00:20:08,577 --> 00:20:10,090
You mean since I got shot?

330
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:42,257
You wanna hear what I think
happened to Buster or not?

00:20:47,457 --> 00:20:50,096

I'm nearing the last coordinates

332
00:20:50,177 --> 00:20:51,769
where our Raptors went missing.

333
00:20:51,857 --> 00:20:53,893
SHARK ON RADIO: <i>Repeat, emer...</i>

334
00:20:54,417 --> 00:20:55,611

335
00:20:55,697 --> 00:20:57,608
RED DEVIL: Buster, is that you?

336
00:20:57,697 --> 00:21:00,973
This is Red Devil, man.
Is that you, buddy? Come back to me.

337
00:21:01,537 --> 00:21:04,893
SHARK ON RADIO: <i>Out of power.</i>
<i>Oxygen almost out.</i>

<i>By the gods, help!</i>

339
00:21:10,177 --> 00:21:14,090
Sir, one of our search Raptors just picked
a possible distress signal

340
00:21:14,177 --> 00:21:17,055
from near where <i>Pegasus</i>
lost communications with Buster's ship.

341
00:21:17,137 --> 00:21:18,126
Finally.

342
00:21:20,937 --> 00:21:25,135
A possible distress signal. There's a theory
that Buster himself might have jumped away

343
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:28,375
to run down a phony distress call.
It could be a trap.

344
00:21:28,697 --> 00:21:31,530
A theory?
Is this your theory, Major?

345
00:21:31,617 --> 00:21:33,892
This is Captain Thrace's theory, is it not?

346
00:21:36,577 --> 00:21:39,853
Mr Thornton, can you give us a fix
on where this distress signal is coming from.

347
00:21:39,937 --> 00:21:42,087
Yes, sir, it's long range, over 40 SU away.

348
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:44,407
Then spin up the FTL drive
and prepare to jump the ship.

349
00:21:44,497 --> 00:21:45,646
Yes, sir.

350
00:21:48,297 --> 00:21:51,687
Sir, this isn't just Captain Thrace's theory.

351
00:21:52,417 --> 00:21:54,009
I think this is a Cylon trap, and...

352
00:21:54,097 --> 00:21:55,655
And I disagree.

353
00:21:56,777 --> 00:21:59,086
Now get Admiral Adama on the line.

354
00:21:59,457 --> 00:22:01,448
I'm going to get our men.

355
00:22:11,017 --> 00:22:13,167
Admiral, we've finally got the break
we've been looking for,

356
00:22:13,257 --> 00:22:14,610
a bearing on the distress signal.

357
00:22:14,697 --> 00:22:16,289
I can jump there inside of two minutes.

358
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:18,732
Commander, believe me,
I understand how you feel.

359
00:22:19,177 --> 00:22:22,010
The Cylons have been known
to lure our ships into traps

360
00:22:22,097 --> 00:22:24,088
<i>using fake distress calls.</i>

361
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:25,371
<i>Have you considered that?</i>

362
00:22:25,457 --> 00:22:28,369
We have, sir.
It's a scenario we don't think likely.

363
00:22:28,457 --> 00:22:29,526
We?

364
00:22:31,497 --> 00:22:33,408
<i>Major Adama, do you concur?</i>

365
00:22:36,937 --> 00:22:38,131
Sir,

366
00:22:39,017 --> 00:22:42,532
Captain Thrace and I are of the opinion
that the first two Raptors

367
00:22:42,617 --> 00:22:44,926
may very well have been lured away
by just such a trick.

368
00:22:45,017 --> 00:22:46,848
An opinion I do not share, sir.

369
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:51,966
We'll send a recon mission in full force.

370
00:22:52,217 --> 00:22:53,650
Five Raptors.

371
00:22:54,057 --> 00:22:56,013
Three escort, two rescue.

372
00:22:56,577 --> 00:22:58,807
<i>You have your orders, Commander.</i>

373
00:22:58,897 --> 00:23:00,535
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

374
00:23:03,737 --> 00:23:05,295
Thank you, Major.

375
00:23:05,857 --> 00:23:08,610
I'm sure your expertise is needed elsewhere.

376
00:23:10,217 --> 00:23:11,252
Yes, sir.

377
00:23:19,617 --> 00:23:21,414
Yes, I am curious.

378
00:23:23,457 --> 00:23:26,608
Why the sudden interest in the fleet's
demographic projections?

379
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:30,167
An issue has emerged that may prove
divisive to our administration.

380
00:23:30,257 --> 00:23:33,533
I would like all the facts in hand
before making my decision.

381
00:23:33,617 --> 00:23:36,177
So now it's our administration.

382
00:23:36,897 --> 00:23:38,615
She must be desperate.

383
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:45,253
Well, I'm a very busy man.

384
00:23:45,577 --> 00:23:48,614
Luckily, I made an initial calculation
on these figures over seven months ago

385
00:23:48,697 --> 00:23:50,449
when nobody seemed interested
or concerned.

386
00:23:50,537 --> 00:23:52,846
All I had to do was factor in the numbers
from the <i>Pegasus</i> crew.

387
00:23:52,937 --> 00:23:55,497
It took me hardly any time at all
and I didn't mind.

388
00:23:55,617 --> 00:23:58,370
Look, I'll save you the bother.
You needn't read the report.

389
00:23:59,417 --> 00:24:01,931
If we continue on our present course,

390
00:24:02,497 --> 00:24:06,854
within the next 18 years,
the human race will simply be extinct.

Well, she had her perspective

550
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:20,691
and I had mine.

551
00:35:24,857 --> 00:35:27,291
In your opinion, off the record,

552
00:35:29,977 --> 00:35:31,729
what was Garner's flaw?

553
00:35:36,177 --> 00:35:38,645
He was used to working with machines.

554
00:35:38,977 --> 00:35:40,376
Command is about people.

555
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:48,370
Remember that

as you take command of The Beast.

Congratulations, Commander.

561
00:36:37,017 --> 00:36:40,646
Madam President, word has it
that you do not intend

562
00:36:40,737 --> 00:36:43,171
to prosecute the Gemenese girl on <i>Galactica.</i>

563
00:36:47,937 --> 00:36:49,734
She has a name, Sarah.

564
00:36:51,857 --> 00:36:54,451
And I think that Rya has suffered enough.

565
00:36:55,937 --> 00:36:57,609
She's just been through an abortion.

566
00:36:57,697 --> 00:37:00,165
I've granted her asylum aboard <i>Galactica.</i>

567
00:37:00,297 --> 00:37:02,686
This is in total violation of the law.

568
00:37:03,417 --> 00:37:05,328
My order came
after she sought her procedure.

569
00:37:05,417 --> 00:37:06,532
No laws have been broken.

570
00:37:06,617 --> 00:37:09,848
The girl belongs at home with her parents.
I insist.

You have your pound of flesh,

572
00:37:14,777 --> 00:37:18,690
and I suggest you take
your victory and you move on.

573
00:37:21,497 --> 00:37:22,486
Ma'am.

00:37:34,777 --> 00:37:36,369

All the pressure, the responsibility,
the sleepless nights.

All the officers giving you a hard time.

578
00:37:43,017 --> 00:37:45,485
Yeah, well, it could be worse.
You could be my CAG.

00:37:59,417 --> 00:38:00,406
Great.

584
00:38:04,377 --> 00:38:05,935
Congratulations.

585
00:38:06,977 --> 00:38:07,966
Really.

586
00:38:09,657 --> 00:38:10,931
Congratulations.

587
00:38:14,937 --> 00:38:16,416
You deserve it.

588
00:38:19,737 --> 00:38:21,967
I know why I was mad at you, Kara.

589
00:38:22,057 --> 00:38:23,729
A simple thank you would've been sufficient.

590
00:38:23,817 --> 00:38:25,694
Because you were doing
what you always did.

591
00:38:25,817 --> 00:38:28,206
Buck authority and get away with it.

592
00:38:30,617 --> 00:38:32,494
I bucked authority once,

593
00:38:34,097 --> 00:38:35,610
and I almost lost everything.

594
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:40,851
So I guess when I showed up
on <i>Pegasus</i> and there you were,

595
00:38:41,417 --> 00:38:43,328
doing it all over again...

596
00:38:45,057 --> 00:38:47,890
I don't know.
It pissed me off.

597
00:38:53,137 --> 00:38:55,207
Doesn't make a lot of sense, does it?

598
00:38:55,537 --> 00:38:57,892
You should hear the way
my brain works sometimes.

599
00:39:07,377 --> 00:39:08,696
Are we okay?

600
00:39:13,297 --> 00:39:14,730

(REPORTERS ASKING QUESTIONS)

602
00:39:32,697 --> 00:39:36,815
Madam President, your decision
to criminalize abortion has created a furore.

603
00:39:37,137 --> 00:39:39,412
Do you think that's hurt
your standing in the polls?

604
00:39:40,977 --> 00:39:42,171
Absolutely.

00:39:42,257 --> 00:39:44,009
If I may, Madam President.

606
00:39:46,297 --> 00:39:48,492
It is true, in the light of recent events,

607
00:39:48,577 --> 00:39:51,091
the President may have lost support
in some quarters.

608
00:39:51,297 --> 00:39:54,892
I would ask the people to understand that,
if this is an extreme decision,

609
00:39:55,337 --> 00:39:57,248
we live in extreme times.

610
00:39:58,337 --> 00:40:00,168
The decision has been made with good faith.

611
00:40:01,337 --> 00:40:04,488
I, however, cannot with good conscience
support it.

612
00:40:08,337 --> 00:40:10,328
I'm so sorry, Madam President,

613
00:40:10,817 --> 00:40:14,173
but the Cylon have no understanding
of the meaning of the word freedom.

614
00:40:14,257 --> 00:40:18,136
How could they?
They're programmed machines.

Every time you take away
one of our freedoms,

616
00:40:22,897 --> 00:40:25,127
every time we restrict
or curtail one of our rights,

617
00:40:25,217 --> 00:40:26,969
we become one step closer
to being like them.

618

As the Vice President, I am bound to follow
the administration's lead.

As President,

620
00:40:36,657 --> 00:40:38,249
I should have no such strictures.

Given the current situation,
I'm afraid that I have no alternative

622
00:40:42,697 --> 00:40:45,609
but to announce that I am, as of now,
a candidate for the Presidency.
