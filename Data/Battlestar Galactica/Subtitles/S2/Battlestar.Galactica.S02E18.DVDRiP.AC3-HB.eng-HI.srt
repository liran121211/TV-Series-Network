The third bullet-head walks the perimeter.

180
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:22,410
The bullet-head walking perimeter makes
random changes to his patrol.

181
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,172
Be tough to get past him.

182
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,813
All right, so we go under them.

183
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,496
The storm drain leads directly to the garage
underneath the cafe.

00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:41,013

She needs oxygen support.

No.

I'm not leaving.

201
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,930
I lived on Caprica for two years.
I knew what I was.

Pretended to be human, but I knew.

203

If you knew what you were and you lived
on Caprica, you know what that makes you?

204
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,499
A really good liar.

Of course, none of it's real.

All fabricated for my mission.

214
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,093

Oh, don't go religious with this one.
What are you thinking?

217
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,969
Do you think I care about your God?

Look, God loves you.

This is love.

These people love me. I love them.

221
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,929
I didn't pretend to feel something
so I could screw people over.

222
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,255
I loved them. And then I betrayed them.

223
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,772
I shot a man I love.

224
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,897
Frakked over another man,
ruined his life. And why?

225

I'm more like you.

00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,611
I had someone I met here. A man.

242
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,659
I loved him and I think he could've
loved me eventually.

243
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,815
Half a cigarette should give us two
or three minutes to get the frak out of there.

244
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:01,097
Any longer and we risk
them finding the charges before they go off.

245
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,532
Is it two minutes or three?

246
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,939
About to find out.

247
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,978
This is a risky operation
just to nail a couple of dozen skin jobs.

248
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,533
You know, we can't kill them.

249
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,929
They'll just download into a new body, and...

250
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,779
I mean, what's the point?

251
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,816
That skin job with Starbuck,

252
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,572
Sharon, they called her,

253
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:23,256
she said that when they download,
they remember everything,

254
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,092
right up until the end.

255
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:28,371
These skin jobs are gonna remember
being blown into tiny little pieces.

256
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,654
That's gotta hurt.

257
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,731
Yeah. I hope it hurts a lot.

258
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,732
Because sooner or later
the message sinks in. There is no safe place,

So if you want to quit living through hell

260
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,650

then get the frak off our planet.

<i>The sunlight on the water.</i>

Yes, magical.

267
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,418
Too bad you nuked it.

268
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:09,210
After I downloaded,
I went back to the ruins of his house.

269
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,369
Why?

270
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:14,132
Like you, I was looking for some sort
of connection to him.

271
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:21,608
Found a few of his things,
even held on to them for a while,

272
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,817
but I realised they were keeping me
from truly embracing my new life.

BOOMER: So, what did you do with them?

274
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,453
I burned them.

275
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,859
But I felt liberated.

276
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,256
Yeah, it's a beautiful story, isn't it?

277
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,777
A shame it's all a pack of lies.

278
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,609
So, who was he? This man you loved?

279
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,058
Maybe you've heard of him.

280
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,008
Gaius Baltar.

281
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,459
Doctor Baltar?

282
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,135
Yeah.

283
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:03,133
He gave you access
to the Colonial defence grid?

284
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,731
He was the one who betrayed us?

285
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,652
"Us." Oh, I love it.

286
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,616
This one thinks
she's more human than Cylon.

287
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,257
Just like someone else I know.

288
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,335
Does he still work for the Cylons?

289
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,615
What?

291
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,409
He's...

292
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,969
He's alive?

293
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,416
He's the Vice President of the Colonies.

294
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,613
You didn't know that?

295
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:44,254
If the baby does survive, the question is,
what do we do with it?

296
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,089
Do?

297
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,051
What are you suggesting?

298
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,573
That we throw it out of an airlock?

299
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,969
I don't make suggestions, Mr Baltar.

300
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,938
If I want to toss a baby
out an airlock, I'd say so.

301
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,773
Well, it's really gratifying
to know that infanticide is not on the table.

302
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:02,010
Do I have to point out
that this is not a baby?

303
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,135
It's a machine.

304
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,780
No, it's half machine, half human.

305
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,210
I suggest we all keep that half in mind.

306
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,736
The Cylons went through
a great deal of trouble to create this thing.

307
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:17,655
It should go without saying that if it's good
for them, it's gonna be bad for us.

308
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,776
I completely agree.

309
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,613
And I take it as a given,
we can't turn it over to Sharon to raise.

310
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,497
That would be disastrous.

311
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,889
ADAMA: There's still another factor
to consider here.

312
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,251
There are Cylons aboard this fleet.

313
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,410
If they find out this thing's been born,

314
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,013
they're gonna make a play for it.

315
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,535
You can see where this is headed, Gaius.

316
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,175

want to believe in the Cylon God.

00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,169
Almost.

Here you go.

331
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,371
Why do you think they kept it from you?

332
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,458
Is the wrong question.

333
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,050
The right question is,
why did she get me to work with you,

334
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,858
knowing that you'd tell me the truth?

335
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,578
She knew I had feelings for Gaius.

336
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,932
Knew that I had trouble letting go of him.

337
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,931
She must've known
it would trigger those feelings,

338
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,169
and those memories.

339
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,095
She's frakking with you, can't you see that?

340
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,215
But why?

341
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,018
Oh, it's so perfectly obvious.

342
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,852
You know,
for self-aware cybernetic life forms,

343
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,532
sometimes you can be unbearably obtuse.

344
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,212

- BALTAR: Careful.

345

00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,449
Fine.

00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,454
Yeah, what about?

349
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:03,735
She asked me to move out.

350
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:04,969
Ah, you know what?

351
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,699
Which is what
we've been asking her for weeks.

352
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,052

00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,892
And I know the difference
between right and wrong.

534
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,929
A murderer is exactly what you are.

535
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:25,329
Life is short, but the next one's not.

536
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:30,298
Let your heart adrift
and your soul will get caught.

537
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,734
I love you, Gaius.

538
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,651
My heart and soul are yours.

539
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,972
(CRASHING)

540
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,219
They're nearly here.

541
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,934
You know why they wanted you
to work with Sharon?

542
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,172
So you'd lose your mind.

543
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,458
They're gonna box you, darling.

544
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,617
Just like they're gonna box Sharon.

545
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,493
We're dangerous.

546
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,529
What?

547
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:01,769
Sharon and I.

548
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:05,010
We're celebrities in a culture based on unity.

549
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,489
No.

550
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,575
Our voices count. More than hers.
More than others'.

551
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,616
We're two heroes of the Cylon, right?

552
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,009
Two heroes with different perspectives
on the war.

553
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:21,018
Perspectives based on our love
of two human beings.

554
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,575
(SNIFFLING)

555
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,412
That's why she wanted me to work with you,

556
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,730
so that you'd tell me
that Gaius was still alive.

557
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,531
And she wanted me to lose my mind.

558
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,734
No, you're corrupted by your experiences.

559
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,253
D'ANNA: You're a waste.

560
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,532
Believe the lies,

561
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:49,852
ignore the truth.
Listen to me, I will show you the proof.

562
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,133
Speak from your heart.

563
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,849
Say the things that you know to be true.

564
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,215
Genocide,

565
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:01,175
murder, vengeance,
they're all sins in the eyes of God.

566
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,419
That's what you and I know.

567
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,731
That's what they don't wanna hear.

568
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,732
Because then they'd have
to rethink what they're doing.

569
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:14,137
They'd have to consider that maybe
the slaughter of mankind was a mistake!

570
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,653
(CRASHING)

571
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,209
God loves me.

572
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,853
We'll see you again soon!

573
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,695
Here.

574
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,779
Looks like they're almost here.

575
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,819
You should get out of here while you can.

576
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,175
The fresh air coming in might lead you out.

577
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,739
Is this some kind of trick?

578
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,811
You can stay and be tortured if you want.

579
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,209
Your call.

580
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,538
(JACKHAMMERING)

581
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:15,292
Who are you? What kind of people are you?

582
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,375
I don't know.

583
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,894
BOOMER: Hey, wait.

584
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,780
How long till she downloads
and tells them what happened?

585
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,017
We had a lot of people in the cafe.

586
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:44,459
At least 36 hours till they get to her.

587
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,255
Long enough.

588
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,534
Long enough for what?

589
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,218
To change things for the better.

590
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,093
What are you talking about?

591
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:03,296
I have never loved anyone more in my life

592
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,253
than I love you now.

593
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,058
(JACKHAMMERING)

594
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,336
Our people need a new beginning.

595
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,616
A new way to live in God's love.

596
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,448
Without hate.

597
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,299
Without all the lies.

598
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,695
All they need is
for someone to show them the way.

599
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,289
Someone like two heroes of the Cylons.

600
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,895
(JACKHAMMERING)

601
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,773
I'm with you.

(RUMBLING)

603
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,573
DORAL: We found them!

604
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,054
They're alive!

605
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,653
Yes, we are!

606
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,534
We're alive.
