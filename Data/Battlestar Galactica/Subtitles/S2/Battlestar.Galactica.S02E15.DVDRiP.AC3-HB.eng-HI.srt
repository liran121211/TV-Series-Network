Oh, you'll find out soon enough.

86
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:15,482

So, how does Scar take out
an experienced pilot like Beano?

95
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,681
- He hides...
- He hides

96
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:52,680
behind an asteroid,
or the debris field that you've ignored

97
00:04:53,407 --> 00:04:56,444
because it looked like
a bunch of harmless rocks.

98
00:04:57,247 --> 00:05:01,604
You see, Scar doesn't like to fight
till the odds are on his side.

99
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:06,396
And then, suddenly, out of nowhere, bam.

100
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,481
He pops out, blows you to pieces.

101
00:05:10,647 --> 00:05:13,559
And then jumps away
before you can return fire.

102
00:05:13,887 --> 00:05:15,843
Well, if you ask me,
I think Scar's a coward.

103
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,885
This isn't dueling pistols at dawn,
this is war.

104
00:05:20,407 --> 00:05:22,398
You never wanna fight fair.

105
00:05:22,607 --> 00:05:25,280
You wanna sneak up behind your enemy

106
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:27,358
and club him over the head.

107
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:31,564
You see, Scar understands that.

108
00:05:32,847 --> 00:05:34,200
And so do I.

109
00:05:35,687 --> 00:05:37,803

00:10:59,487 --> 00:11:03,321
<i>The Pegasus production team has just
turned out its first combat-ready Viper.</i>

178
00:11:03,527 --> 00:11:05,643
We are beginning to replace our losses.

179
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,801

to replace pilots as well?

<i>STARBUCK: Let's review
the tactical situation.</i>

181
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:14,400
Four weeks ago,
our mining ship struck paydirt

182
00:11:14,487 --> 00:11:15,761
on this asteroid.

183
00:11:15,847 --> 00:11:17,246
A pile of strategic metals

184
00:11:17,327 --> 00:11:19,124
that we need to build new ships.

185
00:11:19,287 --> 00:11:21,960
Since we're sitting ducks
until the miners finish the job,

186
00:11:22,047 --> 00:11:24,197
the old man has sent the Fleet
out of harm's way

187
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,118
<i>under the protection of Pegasus.</i>

188
00:11:26,207 --> 00:11:29,119
Our job is to stay behind
and protect the miners.

189
00:11:29,207 --> 00:11:32,836
Unfortunately, this star system
is full of rocks and dust.

190
00:11:33,007 --> 00:11:35,475
Dradis cannot tell the rocks
from the bad guys,

191
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:37,797
so our only reliable
system of detection is...

192
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:39,286
Our eyeballs.

193
00:11:45,567 --> 00:11:49,480
Which means we have to
put those eyeballs way out there.

194
00:11:49,927 --> 00:11:52,646
Split up, cover a huge perimeter.

195
00:11:52,767 --> 00:11:55,839
We'll be patrolling the area
in divisions of four

196
00:11:56,047 --> 00:11:57,366
at these picket points.

197
00:11:57,447 --> 00:11:59,961
Twos. We're going in sections of twos.

198
00:12:00,047 --> 00:12:02,038

PILOT: (WHISPERING) Great.
You ask her to spread out...

206
00:12:29,367 --> 00:12:33,406
Scar and his buddies are out there,
looking for easy kills.

207
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,520
STARBUCK: Let's not give them any.

208
00:12:35,607 --> 00:12:37,837
This operation is vital

209
00:12:38,567 --> 00:12:41,365
to the long-term survival of this Fleet.

210
00:12:41,447 --> 00:12:42,562
ADAMA: Yes, it is.

211
00:12:43,607 --> 00:12:45,837
And we'll continue to support it.

212
00:12:46,287 --> 00:12:48,596
They're grinding us down Viper by Viper.

213

<i>Why have they stopped
coming at us en masse?</i>

214
00:12:51,287 --> 00:12:53,676
Is it because we destroyed
their Resurrection ship?

215
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:55,485
Starbuck's working on that.

216
00:12:55,767 --> 00:12:57,200
You know, Scar has probably died

217
00:12:57,287 --> 00:12:59,198
and been reborn a dozen times.

218
00:13:01,127 --> 00:13:02,879
You may have faced him before.

219
00:13:03,567 --> 00:13:06,479
So what, Raiders reincarnate, just like you?

220
00:13:06,847 --> 00:13:08,724
Yeah. Just like me.

221
00:13:10,927 --> 00:13:12,076
Great.

222
00:13:12,727 --> 00:13:14,524
What a frakking world.

223
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:18,237
A Raider's much like a trained animal,

224
00:13:18,327 --> 00:13:21,478
with basic consciousness
and survival instinct.

225
00:13:23,287 --> 00:13:26,438
You know, but with the destruction
of the Resurrection ship,

226
00:13:26,527 --> 00:13:29,121
when they die, they're really dead.

227
00:13:29,847 --> 00:13:32,236
So, they're not gonna mount mass attacks

228
00:13:32,327 --> 00:13:33,999
where they could have major casualties.

229
00:13:35,767 --> 00:13:37,519
Raiders reincarnate.

230
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:40,044
Makes sense, doesn't it?

231
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:42,518
It takes months for you to train a nugget

232
00:13:42,607 --> 00:13:44,279
into an effective Viper pilot.

233
00:13:44,807 --> 00:13:47,275
And then they get killed
and then you lose your experience,

234
00:13:47,367 --> 00:13:49,005
their knowledge, their skill sets,

235
00:13:49,087 --> 00:13:50,520
it's gone forever.

236
00:13:50,687 --> 00:13:53,076
So, if you could bring them back
and put them in a brand new body,

237
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:54,680
wouldn't you do it?

238
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:57,327
'Cause death then becomes
a learning experience.

239
00:14:00,567 --> 00:14:04,196

I mean, have you lost?

when I look at you

242
00:14:19,407 --> 00:14:22,046
and I forget what you are.

243
00:14:25,207 --> 00:14:26,720

244
00:14:28,087 --> 00:14:29,600
that kid

245
00:14:30,887 --> 00:14:33,560
that's pooched her landings day after day.

246
00:14:35,327 --> 00:14:36,999
The kid that was frakking the Chief

247
00:14:37,087 --> 00:14:39,476
and thinking she was getting away with it.

248
00:14:44,007 --> 00:14:45,645
Yeah, I remember.

249
00:14:49,367 --> 00:14:51,403
You were like a big sister.

250
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:06,596
Kara,

251
00:15:07,527 --> 00:15:09,483
be careful of Scar, okay?

252
00:15:10,207 --> 00:15:11,276
He's filled with rage.

253
00:15:11,367 --> 00:15:12,686
About what?

254
00:15:13,367 --> 00:15:15,597
Dying's a painful and traumatic experience.

255
00:15:16,327 --> 00:15:19,285
Every time he's reborn,
he's filled with more bitter memories.

256
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:23,406
Scar hates you every bit as much
as you hate him.

257
00:15:32,847 --> 00:15:35,884
STARBUCK: A Raider is
a squirmy son of a bitch.

258
00:15:36,527 --> 00:15:39,519
You won't be able to keep him in your sights
for more than two seconds,

259
00:15:39,607 --> 00:15:42,644
so you have to deliver a killing burst
within that time,

260
00:15:42,727 --> 00:15:45,082
or he will turn and nail you.

261
00:15:45,167 --> 00:15:46,680
All that yanking and banking

262
00:15:46,767 --> 00:15:49,486

00:20:26,127 --> 00:20:29,676
so I either fly him or I ground him
and then we go up short.

351
00:20:30,967 --> 00:20:32,525
What's it gonna be?

352
00:20:33,247 --> 00:20:34,726
Your call, Kat.

353
00:20:37,767 --> 00:20:40,804
<i>STARBUCK: Galactica, Starbuck.
Wilco return to base.</i>

354
00:20:40,887 --> 00:20:42,081
DUALLA: Roger that, Starbuck.

355
00:20:42,167 --> 00:20:43,202
<i>DUCK: BB, Duck.</i>

356
00:20:43,287 --> 00:20:46,120
<i>Four Raiders from behind the rock
at left ten, coming hard.</i>

357
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,276
<i>Looks like Scar.</i>

358
00:20:47,367 --> 00:20:49,119
<i>BB: Duck, BB, what do we do?</i>

359
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:52,358
<i>DUCK: We don't have enough fuel
to mix it up. We bug out, BB.</i>

360
00:20:52,447 --> 00:20:54,642
<i>Let our relief deal with them.
We're going home.</i>

361
00:20:54,727 --> 00:20:58,322
<i>BB: Negative. Starbuck said
to turn into any attack. Weapons hot.</i>

362
00:20:58,407 --> 00:21:00,523
You're bingo fuel. Don't attack, you idiot.

363
00:21:00,607 --> 00:21:03,246
<i>DUCK: Gods damn it, BB,
this is the frakking exception.</i>

364
00:21:03,327 --> 00:21:04,919
<i>Abort and reform!</i>

365
00:21:05,327 --> 00:21:07,079
<i>STARBUCK: Duck, Starbuck. Position?</i>

366
00:21:07,167 --> 00:21:08,964
<i>DUCK: Four-two alpha, behind the Big Spud.</i>

367
00:21:09,047 --> 00:21:11,561
<i>We need a hand, right frakking now.</i>

368
00:21:12,487 --> 00:21:15,047
You're on your own, Duck.
Everybody's way out of range.

369
00:21:15,127 --> 00:21:17,402
<i>STARBUCK: Duck, be there in six minutes.</i>

370
00:21:17,487 --> 00:21:19,239
<i>KAT: Duck, Kat. Eight minutes, out.</i>

371
00:21:19,327 --> 00:21:21,795
<i>BB: Duck, they're on my six! Oh, my gods.</i>

372
00:21:21,887 --> 00:21:23,161
<i>Duck!</i>

373
00:21:41,847 --> 00:21:42,882
It's all right, Jo-Jo.

374
00:21:42,967 --> 00:21:44,446
MAN: Verify PC-2 pressure zero,

375
00:21:44,527 --> 00:21:47,564
throttles closed, oxygen generator
and master switches off.

376
00:21:51,687 --> 00:21:53,439
Check. Shutdown complete.

377
00:21:53,527 --> 00:21:54,721
Nothing you could do, Captain.

378
00:21:54,807 --> 00:21:56,160
Too far away.

379
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:01,483
KAT: Nice work, Starbuck.

380
00:22:01,567 --> 00:22:03,523
What the hell happened to BB?

381
00:22:03,607 --> 00:22:04,960
What happened?

382
00:22:05,247 --> 00:22:08,159
He did exactly what you told him
to do, Captain.

383
00:22:09,487 --> 00:22:11,682
Him and Duck had bingo fuel
and a head start home,

384
00:22:11,767 --> 00:22:14,440
but instead, that FNG turned and attacked.

385
00:22:15,047 --> 00:22:17,277
Scar lit him up like a pinwheel.

386
00:22:17,887 --> 00:22:20,162
Why'd he try to take on Scar by himself?

387
00:22:20,327 --> 00:22:21,840
Stupid idiot.

388
00:22:21,927 --> 00:22:23,804
"Try to run and you're dead."

389
00:22:23,887 --> 00:22:26,879
I heard you. You drilled that
into that poor moron's head.

390
00:22:28,247 --> 00:22:29,362
You know what?

391
00:22:29,447 --> 00:22:32,086
You and I both know that 99% of the time

392
00:22:32,167 --> 00:22:34,283
that is the right move.

393
00:22:34,407 --> 00:22:36,159
Hmm. Not this time.

394
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:49,164
APOLLO: You know what gets me?

395
00:22:50,727 --> 00:22:54,515
I know that in two weeks
I won't remember his face.

396
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:59,477
I can't remember any of their faces
after they're killed.

397
00:23:00,327 --> 00:23:02,966
No matter how hard I try, they just fade.

398
00:23:04,727 --> 00:23:07,036
I don't even remember their names.

399
00:23:09,007 --> 00:23:10,326
The names.

400
00:23:10,967 --> 00:23:14,118
Well, let's see, there was Flattop,

401
00:23:18,727 --> 00:23:21,321
who bought it on his thousandth landing.

402
00:23:22,007 --> 00:23:23,679
There was Chuckles.

403
00:23:24,447 --> 00:23:26,563
(LAUGHING) Stop it, all right?

404
00:23:26,647 --> 00:23:28,239
Please, it's not funny.

405
00:23:28,327 --> 00:23:29,396
All right.

406
00:23:29,487 --> 00:23:31,364
- It's not funny.
- It is funny.

407
00:23:31,687 --> 00:23:35,839
You know, the President says
that we're saving humanity

408
00:23:36,847 --> 00:23:39,839
for a bright, shiny future

409
00:23:41,527 --> 00:23:42,721
on Earth

410
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:46,475
that you and I are never gonna see.

411
00:23:48,647 --> 00:23:51,684
We're not. Because we go out

412
00:23:52,767 --> 00:23:56,806
over and over again,

413
00:23:58,207 --> 00:24:02,120
until some day, some metal motherfrakker

414
00:24:04,967 --> 00:24:08,323
is gonna catch us on a bad day
and just blow us away.

415
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:14,120
Bright, shiny futures are overrated, anyway.

416
00:24:24,647 --> 00:24:25,966
That's why

417
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:30,277
we got to get what we can right now.

418
00:24:32,687 --> 00:24:34,245
I'll drink to that.

419
00:24:36,607 --> 00:24:38,006
To right now.

420
00:24:43,847 --> 00:24:45,405
So why don't we?

421
00:24:48,127 --> 00:24:49,719
Why don't we what?

422
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:04,526
- Hey, wait a minute.
- What?

423
00:25:04,607 --> 00:25:05,756
Wait a minute.

424
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:11,045
Ow! Hey, slow down.

425
00:25:13,167 --> 00:25:14,885
(METAL CLATTERING)

426
00:25:21,407 --> 00:25:23,204
Whoa. This isn't a race.

427
00:25:23,287 --> 00:25:25,676
Kara, what's going on? What's going on?

428
00:25:26,167 --> 00:25:28,476
What's wrong with you? All right?

429
00:25:30,007 --> 00:25:33,522
Okay, you know what? I don't wanna know.
I don't wanna know.

430
00:25:33,607 --> 00:25:35,438
Hey! What about us?

431
00:25:35,527 --> 00:25:37,404
There is no "us". All right?

432
00:25:37,487 --> 00:25:38,920
I just wanted a good lay.

433
00:25:39,047 --> 00:25:41,720
There is nothing here. Do you get that?

434
00:25:41,967 --> 00:25:43,400
- Nothing!
- Sure.

435
00:25:45,207 --> 00:25:46,481
My gods!

436
00:25:51,647 --> 00:25:52,636
Hey.

437
00:25:55,047 --> 00:25:56,480
Well, that's just great.

438
00:25:56,567 --> 00:25:58,205
Frak or fight, huh?

439
00:25:58,287 --> 00:26:01,120
Okay, maybe I am just a quick lay,

440
00:26:01,207 --> 00:26:02,720
but, Kara, I'm also your friend.

441
00:26:02,807 --> 00:26:05,241
I am hung up on a dead guy, okay?

442
00:26:06,327 --> 00:26:08,397
And it is pissing me off.

443
00:26:09,447 --> 00:26:11,677
And I don't know what I'm doing.

444
00:26:15,847 --> 00:26:18,315
Anders, right? On Caprica.
The resistance fighter.

445
00:26:18,727 --> 00:26:20,399
Yeah, well, Samuel's dead,
so what does it matter?

446
00:26:20,487 --> 00:26:22,955
- Oh, Kara, please, for once in your life...
- I don't need your pity, Lee.

447
00:26:23,047 --> 00:26:24,560
You haven't got my pity!

448
00:26:24,647 --> 00:26:26,956
Listen, you are fine.
You are fine with the dead guys.

449
00:26:27,047 --> 00:26:29,277
It's the living ones you can't deal with.

450
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,560
There you are. Got visual on you, Starbuck.

451
00:27:48,647 --> 00:27:50,399
I'm inbound about 15 out.

452
00:27:53,647 --> 00:27:54,636
Now!

453
00:27:57,207 --> 00:27:59,675
<i>STARBUCK: All right, Scar,
let's see how much you like playing chicken</i>

(GUN FIRING)

456
00:28:02,207 --> 00:28:03,322
How's it feel, you bastard?

457
00:28:03,407 --> 00:28:06,558
One of us is gonna have to break away first
and it isn't gonna be me.

458
00:28:11,287 --> 00:28:14,723
<i>KAT: Starbuck, wake up!
He's a machine! He's not gonna break!</i>

459

<i>You're committing suicide, Starbuck!</i>

460
00:28:37,407 --> 00:28:39,159
In two-on-two engagements,

461
00:28:39,247 --> 00:28:42,319
Cylon Raiders like to isolate
individual Vipers,

462
00:28:43,087 --> 00:28:44,998
and then gang up on one,

463
00:28:46,167 --> 00:28:50,001
hoping to kill it before his wingman
has a chance to protect him.

464
00:28:53,127 --> 00:28:54,355
MAN: Captain.

465
00:29:03,207 --> 00:29:05,960
Which is exactly what happened
to Jo-Jo 20 minutes ago.

466
00:29:06,047 --> 00:29:07,560
KAT: Oh, no.
DUCK: Frak me.

467
00:29:07,967 --> 00:29:09,286
Was it Scar?

468
00:29:09,887 --> 00:29:13,323
The bastard smoked Jo-Jo and jumped away
in less than 15 seconds

469
00:29:13,487 --> 00:29:15,717
before his wingman could get a shot off.

470
00:29:17,167 --> 00:29:18,885
And where were you?

471
00:29:21,687 --> 00:29:22,756
What?

472
00:29:23,487 --> 00:29:27,275
Flight schedule had you flying lead
for Jo-Jo on that patrol, so,

473
00:29:27,887 --> 00:29:30,606
why'd you assign Snake to take your place?

474
00:29:31,207 --> 00:29:34,244
Was it too early in the morning
for you, Starbuck?

475
00:29:35,087 --> 00:29:37,965
What exactly are you trying
to say, Lieutenant?

476
00:29:38,487 --> 00:29:41,001
What I'm trying to say, Captain,

477
00:29:41,087 --> 00:29:43,317
is maybe if you weren't up
all night drinking,

478
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:45,398
Jo-Jo would have still been here.

479
00:29:45,487 --> 00:29:47,159
PILOT: (WHISPERING) Shut up.

480
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:48,362
Hmm.

(CLEARS THROAT)

482
00:29:54,527 --> 00:29:56,085

(ALL MURMURING)

What is it with you, Katraine?

485
00:30:16,087 --> 00:30:20,444
Ever since I got back,
you have been on my ass like a bad rash.

486
00:30:20,927 --> 00:30:23,316
You know, coming in late for a briefing
because you're hung over,

487
00:30:23,407 --> 00:30:24,442
that's bad enough,

488
00:30:24,527 --> 00:30:26,882
but when you back out on a mission...

489
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:31,718
I put Snake in my place because I was
in no condition to fly and I knew that.

490
00:30:32,927 --> 00:30:35,282
You see, unlike you,
I don't take a bunch of pills

491
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:37,164
and then climb in my cockpit so wired

492
00:30:37,247 --> 00:30:39,442
that I can't land the frakking ship.

493
00:30:42,167 --> 00:30:44,601
Starbuck, you're an embarrassment.

494
00:30:45,687 --> 00:30:47,996
You used to be the hottest
stick on the Fleet.

495
00:30:48,087 --> 00:30:49,076
Now,

496
00:30:50,287 --> 00:30:53,438
you're just a reckless drunk
who sends other people out to get killed.

497
00:30:59,887 --> 00:31:02,401
What are you gonna?
What are you gonna do?

498
00:31:02,487 --> 00:31:04,762
Are you going to hit me, Starbuck?

499
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,925
It scares you, doesn't it?

500
00:31:11,007 --> 00:31:12,565
Actually, no.

501
00:31:15,567 --> 00:31:18,001
You're afraid most of the time, Kat.

502
00:31:19,047 --> 00:31:20,480
You're afraid that you're going to end up

503
00:31:20,567 --> 00:31:22,842
like that picture of Reilly's girlfriend.

504
00:31:24,527 --> 00:31:25,960
Some little

505
00:31:27,527 --> 00:31:31,566
forgotten picture
that nobody really remembers.

506
00:31:34,087 --> 00:31:37,124
You see, that's why
you're riding my ass so hard.

507
00:31:38,447 --> 00:31:40,563
So no one will notice that Scar

508
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:43,956

00:32:09,767 --> 00:32:11,723
It must have been lively.

513

All right, I'm pairing you two up.

514
00:32:16,407 --> 00:32:18,921
Kat, I want you to fly Starbuck's wing
out by the Big Spud.

515
00:32:19,007 --> 00:32:20,326
Sir, I...

516
00:32:23,087 --> 00:32:25,999
I got a hunch a couple Raiders are gonna
try and sneak through that sector,

517
00:32:26,087 --> 00:32:29,636
so I want my heavy hitters out there
to greet them.

518

Starbuck.

521
00:32:55,567 --> 00:32:56,966
Are you okay?

<i>STARBUCK ON RADIO: Entering Sector 2-5-9.</i>

523
00:34:05,087 --> 00:34:08,443
<i>Keep your eyes open, Kat.
This is where BB and Jo-Jo bought it.</i>

524
00:34:09,007 --> 00:34:10,963
Kassie. Kassie? Maybe that was her name?

525
00:34:11,407 --> 00:34:13,318
You know, Kat, I told you
I have no frakking idea.

526
00:34:13,407 --> 00:34:14,522
So give it a rest, all right?

527
00:34:14,607 --> 00:34:16,438
<i>KAT: Whoa, hold up, Starbuck. You see that?</i>

528
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:18,598
Oh, yeah, it's got to be Scar.

529
00:34:31,647 --> 00:34:33,558
<i>STARBUCK: Something's definitely wrong.</i>

530
00:34:33,647 --> 00:34:35,285
<i>That can't be Scar.</i>

531
00:34:38,167 --> 00:34:39,202
Frak! I'm hit.

532
00:34:39,287 --> 00:34:40,356
<i>KAT: Starbuck!</i>

533
00:34:40,447 --> 00:34:42,165
<i>STARBUCK: I'm hit, I'm hit, I'm hit!</i>

534
00:34:45,607 --> 00:34:47,962
Don't be an idiot, Starbuck!
What's your position?

535
00:34:50,007 --> 00:34:52,077
<i>STARBUCK: Yeah, you remember me,
don't you?</i>

536
00:34:53,527 --> 00:34:55,085
There you are.
I got visual on you, Starbuck.

537
00:34:55,167 --> 00:34:56,600
I'm inbound about 15 out.

538
00:34:56,687 --> 00:34:59,121
<i>STARBUCK: All right, Scar, let's see
how much you like playing chicken</i>

<i>when you can't downward, you bitch.</i>

540
00:35:01,527 --> 00:35:02,880
How's it feel, you bastard?

541
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:05,845
One of us is gonna have to break away first
and it isn't gonna be me.

542
00:35:05,927 --> 00:35:08,839
Starbuck, I'm inbound your starboard...

543
00:35:11,247 --> 00:35:12,839
Starbuck, wake up!

544
00:35:13,847 --> 00:35:16,077
<i>KAT: He's a machine! He's not gonna break!</i>

545
00:35:22,327 --> 00:35:24,761
<i>He's a machine! He's not gonna break!</i>

546
00:35:26,047 --> 00:35:28,038
I never said he would.

547
00:35:29,367 --> 00:35:31,597
<i>KAT: You're committing suicide, Starbuck!</i>

548
00:35:40,007 --> 00:35:41,520
I'm coming back.

549
00:35:48,047 --> 00:35:50,845
I said it. I meant it.

550
00:35:53,327 --> 00:35:54,362
Yeah, okay.

551
00:36:24,847 --> 00:36:26,041
Gods damn it!

552
00:36:33,287 --> 00:36:35,164
I am gonna put him right in front of you.

553
00:36:35,247 --> 00:36:37,238
Do not miss him, you frakking stim junkie.

556
00:37:02,927 --> 00:37:05,760
That's the way it's done! Yeah!

557
00:37:05,927 --> 00:37:07,963

KAT: Captain Starbuck!

561
00:37:25,847 --> 00:37:27,326
Hey, Starbuck.

562
00:37:28,887 --> 00:37:30,559
My cup runneth dry.

563
00:37:33,447 --> 00:37:37,122
Seems I recall somebody boasting
that my lips would never touch this rim?

564
00:38:16,567 --> 00:38:18,000
WOMAN: For you, Kat.

565
00:38:22,047 --> 00:38:23,480
You earned it.

566
00:38:43,327 --> 00:38:44,476
To BB,

567
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,522
Jo-Jo,

568
00:38:48,887 --> 00:38:50,036
Reilly,

Beano,

Dipper,

Flattop.

Chuckles.

Puppet.

Fireball.

581
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,446
To all of them.

582
00:39:51,767 --> 00:39:53,200
So say we all.

583
00:39:53,607 --> 00:39:55,723
ALL: So say we all!

584
00:39:56,247 --> 00:39:57,726
So say we all.

585
00:40:05,407 --> 00:40:07,523
I could have done it, you know?

586
00:40:08,607 --> 00:40:10,040
I could have taken out Scar.

587
00:40:12,447 --> 00:40:14,836
Head-on pass, straight for him.

588
00:40:17,767 --> 00:40:20,122
Just needed to get a little closer.

589
00:40:21,047 --> 00:40:22,605
So why didn't you do it?

590
00:40:22,927 --> 00:40:25,077
I probably would have died in the process.

591
00:40:25,527 --> 00:40:27,438
The bastard was too good.

592
00:40:28,607 --> 00:40:31,644
A couple months ago,
I wouldn't even have thought about that.

593
00:40:31,927 --> 00:40:33,280
Would have just gone for the glory,

594
00:40:33,367 --> 00:40:35,722
hoping I could pull it out of the fire
somehow.

595
00:40:36,447 --> 00:40:38,039
Don't be kicking yourself.

596
00:40:38,127 --> 00:40:41,039
You did the right thing
and called in your wingman, okay?

597
00:40:41,127 --> 00:40:43,687
Scar's dead. You and Kat came back alive.

598
00:40:46,807 --> 00:40:48,286
That's not why I did it, though.

599
00:40:48,367 --> 00:40:50,358
I can't get Anders out of my head.

600
00:40:51,247 --> 00:40:54,603
I can't get over this insane hope
that maybe he's alive.

601
00:41:01,607 --> 00:41:03,563
You got something to live for now,

602
00:41:03,647 --> 00:41:05,205
not just die for.

603
00:41:12,567 --> 00:41:13,886

604
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:17,879

606
00:41:22,207 --> 00:41:24,118
Time out. Okay.
