00:00:20,235 --> 00:00:23,068
<i>(male narrator) Previously
on Battlestar Galactica.</i>

2
00:00:23,499 --> 00:00:26,366
This will be Adama's command
until the day he dies.

3
00:00:26,379 --> 00:00:28,438
And we are not going
to let him die.

4
00:00:29,548 --> 00:00:31,996
<i>(Gaeta) Sir, what about our
people on the surface of Kobol?</i>

5
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:34,445
<i>(Tigh) If they're still
alive, they'll have to wait.</i>

6
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:37,866
El-tee, I think we should double-check
the supplies before we bug out.

7
00:00:37,901 --> 00:00:39,236
We don't have the time,
Chief.

8
00:00:40,011 --> 00:00:43,469
I could give you a shot, but you
wouldn't like the side effects.

9
00:00:43,531 --> 00:00:45,396
Just do it.

10
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:49,313
The time is going to come when
you're not going to be able to hide...

11
00:00:49,348 --> 00:00:50,783
what you're going through.

12
00:00:52,203 --> 00:00:55,570
His lungs are filling up with fluid,
if he doesn't get more Serisone soon...

13
00:00:55,605 --> 00:00:57,126
he's not gonna make it.

14
00:00:57,163 --> 00:01:01,031
Tarn, you forgot the med kit, so
you've got to go back and get it.

15
00:01:01,066 --> 00:01:02,736
Take a rifle, two clips
of ammo and a canteen.

16
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:05,256
[Guns firing]

17
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:11,605
(Seelix) It's too late.
He's not gonna make it.

18
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:13,970
(Crashdown)
I'm sorry, Chief.

19
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:24,210
(Crashdown)
Lords of Kobol...

20
00:01:24,907 --> 00:01:27,603
take these brave men
into your arms.

21
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:30,485
Take up... Take...

22
00:01:32,651 --> 00:01:35,017
the spirits
of our fallen friends...

23
00:01:35,371 --> 00:01:38,169
so that they may share
in the everlasting life...

24
00:01:38,379 --> 00:01:41,314
that awaits us all
beyond the vale of tears.

25
00:01:42,315 --> 00:01:45,716
So say we all. (all) So say we all.

26
00:01:49,227 --> 00:01:52,924
Nothing awaits them. No
eternal life. No damnation.

27
00:01:53,995 --> 00:01:55,292
Only oblivion.

28
00:01:56,811 --> 00:01:59,780
Because they haven't seen
the face of God, I take it?

29
00:01:59,883 --> 00:02:03,944
Because they died here,
on Kobol.

30
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:06,259
I see.

31
00:02:06,891 --> 00:02:08,654
(Tyrol)
Doc, let's go.

32
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:11,584
We're moving out.

33
00:02:14,091 --> 00:02:15,888
Doc, you hear me?

34
00:02:17,963 --> 00:02:19,328
We're moving out.

35
00:02:19,915 --> 00:02:21,644
No, I did hear you, Chief.

36
00:02:22,731 --> 00:02:24,648
I just don't respond
to the title "Doc."

37
00:02:24,683 --> 00:02:28,120
A "dock" is a platform for
loading and unloading material.

38
00:02:28,155 --> 00:02:31,558
My title is Doctor or Mr. Vice
President, if you don't mind.

39
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:33,682
You are loading,
are you not?

40
00:02:40,715 --> 00:02:41,773
(Tyrol)
El-tee?

41
00:02:42,827 --> 00:02:44,556
El-tee? Crash!

42
00:02:45,643 --> 00:02:47,668
Yeah, Chief,
I'll be right there.

43
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:04,832
No Cylons. (Crashdown) You sure?

44
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,133
[Groans]

45
00:03:10,155 --> 00:03:13,488
Wait a minute.
Tree line, 2:00.

46
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,776
Got them.
What're they doing?

47
00:03:20,907 --> 00:03:22,932
(Tyrol) Looks like they're
dismantling the ship.

48
00:03:22,967 --> 00:03:24,220
(Crashdown)
Why?

49
00:03:24,427 --> 00:03:27,555
Why not use it to fly the
hell out of here? I don't know.

50
00:03:28,043 --> 00:03:29,237
I can't tell.

51
00:03:30,091 --> 00:03:32,355
They're dragging it
into the tree line.

52
00:03:32,715 --> 00:03:35,513
Oh, wait a minute.
They're building something.

53
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,231
Chief, is that a...
A missile.

54
00:03:38,315 --> 00:03:40,442
They're building
a missile battery.

55
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:43,772
Well, at least we know
why they're not chasing us.

56
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:47,757
Why?

57
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:51,999
Why aren't they chasing us?
Because they don't have to.

58
00:03:53,899 --> 00:03:56,697
[Sighing] They can just sit
back, launch a missile barrage...

59
00:03:56,732 --> 00:03:59,484
that'll wipe out every
living thing in this valley.

60
00:04:07,403 --> 00:04:08,427
[People chattering]

61
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:11,019
Next time I say I'm in a hurry,
cycle the damn airlock faster.

62
00:04:11,054 --> 00:04:11,976
Is this your first day?

63
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:13,478
Dr. Cottle,
thank the gods you're here.

64
00:04:13,482 --> 00:04:14,813
The President needs your help. Move!

65
00:04:14,827 --> 00:04:16,522
Doctor. Doctor!

66
00:04:22,059 --> 00:04:23,048
Okay.

67
00:04:24,235 --> 00:04:26,396
Let's have some vitals.
Like now.

68
00:04:26,443 --> 00:04:27,637
(Kim)
Two bullets, 9 mm.

69
00:04:27,659 --> 00:04:29,992
This one lacerated the spleen,
the other nicked the aorta.

70
00:04:30,027 --> 00:04:32,621
Now, we've removed the spleen
and felt we repaired the aorta...

71
00:04:32,656 --> 00:04:34,728
Over the past few hours,
his B.P.'s dropped down again.

72
00:04:34,763 --> 00:04:37,998
It's only 80I40, and his heart
rate's creeping back into the 130s.

73
00:04:38,033 --> 00:04:41,234
Well, you missed something. He's
still hemorrhaging somewhere.

74
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:47,748
We're gonna lose him unless
we can stop that bleeding.

75
00:04:48,235 --> 00:04:52,899
Get me an ABG, CBC and coags and get
set up for a rapid sequence intubation.

76
00:04:52,934 --> 00:04:55,509
Is he gonna make it? How should
I know? I'm not a psychic.

77
00:04:55,544 --> 00:04:57,298
Now get the hell
out of here.

78
00:05:45,451 --> 00:05:47,282
(Cottle)
It's a mess in here.

79
00:05:48,491 --> 00:05:52,791
Looks like the mesenteric
artery may have been damaged.

80
00:05:52,826 --> 00:05:54,076
3.7 Mac.

81
00:05:55,627 --> 00:05:58,858
Gods damn it, Kim, learn the
instruments! I said a 3.7 Mac!

82
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,016
(Kim)
Sorry.

83
00:06:00,491 --> 00:06:02,891
Clamp it. Clamp!

84
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,487
(Ishay) Dr. Cottle,
his pressure's dropping.

85
00:06:05,522 --> 00:06:07,368
It's 60I30.
Heart rate's starting to fall.

86
00:06:07,403 --> 00:06:09,853
I don't think he can last
much longer. Just stay focused.

87
00:06:09,888 --> 00:06:12,304
Get some more suction in here
so I can see what I'm doing.

88
00:06:29,035 --> 00:06:30,161
[Grunts]

89
00:06:30,795 --> 00:06:32,660
Colonel,
how's the Commander?

90
00:06:32,938 --> 00:06:35,687
What?
How's the Commander?

91
00:06:35,722 --> 00:06:38,624
He's still in surgery.
What's on your mind?

92
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:41,447
I need some medication
for the President.

93
00:06:41,482 --> 00:06:44,576
She's not the President anymore.
Cottle's a little busy right now.

94
00:06:44,611 --> 00:06:47,321
Sir, she's very ill...
Why aren't you in the brig?

95
00:06:50,155 --> 00:06:52,487
Because no one
put me in there.

96
00:07:03,627 --> 00:07:06,755
What the hell's all this?
Why aren't you in the brig?

97
00:07:06,923 --> 00:07:09,653
I'm on duty, sir. Planning
the search and rescue mission.

98
00:07:09,688 --> 00:07:11,704
Search and rescue?
For who?

99
00:07:12,491 --> 00:07:14,652
We lose a plane
and nobody tells me?

100
00:07:17,866 --> 00:07:22,394
For our Raptor crew down
on the surface of Kobol, sir.

101
00:07:24,522 --> 00:07:27,496
Simes is senior pilot now.
He can plan the SAR.

102
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:30,625
You asked me to command the air group
when I'm on duty, and I'm on duty...

103
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,630
so am I in command or not?

104
00:07:41,035 --> 00:07:43,526
What's the status
of the SAR, Captain?

105
00:07:43,691 --> 00:07:46,990
<i>(Apollo) Well, we don't know
in what area Raptor 3 went down.</i>

106
00:07:47,025 --> 00:07:48,968
So the only realistic chance
we have of finding her...

107
00:07:49,003 --> 00:07:52,131
is the hope that her transponder or
disaster beacon is still functioning.

108
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,268
I intend to take
two Raptors...

109
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:56,570
one with medical personnel, and make
five low-level orbits of the planet.

110
00:07:56,605 --> 00:07:59,849
What about that Cylon base ship that
Lt. Valerii supposedly destroyed?

111
00:07:59,884 --> 00:08:01,379
What if she was lying?

112
00:08:01,387 --> 00:08:03,432
Racetrack confirmed the
destruction of the base ship...

113
00:08:03,467 --> 00:08:07,460
and I checked the gun-camera footage
from the Raptors, which verifies it.

114
00:08:09,642 --> 00:08:11,701
Lt. Gaeta,
why are you hovering about?

115
00:08:11,736 --> 00:08:13,750
It's the press.
The press?

116
00:08:13,771 --> 00:08:16,604
They're demanding to know how much
longer we plan on holding them...

117
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,376
and when they can contact
their home-ships.

118
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:21,639
They demand? They're in no
position to demand anything.

119
00:08:21,674 --> 00:08:25,110
You tell them to shut their yaps.
We'll get to them in due time.

120
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:26,998
(Dualla)
Excuse me, Colonel.

121
00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:31,183
<i>Shuttle from the Zephyr has just requested
permission to enter the landing pattern.</i>

122
00:08:31,218 --> 00:08:32,872
<i>The Zephyr?
Yes, sir.</i>

123
00:08:32,907 --> 00:08:36,707
Evidently the Quorum of Twelve is
aboard. They're demanding to see you.

124
00:08:36,715 --> 00:08:37,875
They demand?

125
00:08:37,898 --> 00:08:40,196
Demanding job,
commanding a battlestar.

126
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,717
Clear them to land.

127
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:47,784
Put them in the Ward Room and hold them
there until I have time to see them.

128
00:08:52,202 --> 00:08:53,396
Stop!

129
00:08:57,194 --> 00:08:59,143
Madam President? What's wrong with her?

130
00:08:59,178 --> 00:09:02,045
I don't know, but she's clearly
sick. You can see that, can't you?

131
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,894
But there's nothing I can do.

132
00:09:07,883 --> 00:09:10,113
Madam President?
Yes.

133
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:13,659
Can I get you anything
while you're in the brig?

134
00:09:15,403 --> 00:09:16,495
[Exhaling]

135
00:09:19,082 --> 00:09:20,310
Billy.

136
00:09:22,091 --> 00:09:23,581
No, thank you.

137
00:09:31,658 --> 00:09:33,023
I'm sorry.

138
00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:36,990
I'm finding it...
hard to think.

139
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,442
It's withdrawal.

140
00:09:39,594 --> 00:09:41,687
<i>The chamalla.
Yes.</i>

141
00:09:42,283 --> 00:09:45,184
I'm trying to get you more.
Go fast.

142
00:09:51,595 --> 00:09:53,688
[Chirping]

143
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:59,889
I count six missiles being carried
into the forest site so far.

144
00:10:03,594 --> 00:10:05,391
It's all so pointless.

145
00:10:10,987 --> 00:10:15,219
We kill them,
and they kill us.

146
00:10:17,003 --> 00:10:19,198
So we kill more of them and...

147
00:10:23,946 --> 00:10:27,279
so they kill more of us.
What's the point anymore?

148
00:10:27,314 --> 00:10:31,079
You,
your race invented murder.

149
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,966
Invented killing for sport,
greed, envy...

150
00:10:35,626 --> 00:10:38,117
It's man's one true art form.

151
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:41,199
You've done some
killing of your own, I think.

152
00:10:41,226 --> 00:10:44,024
Yes, well, we're your
children. You taught us well.

153
00:10:45,803 --> 00:10:49,223
Why does God want to bring a child
into this kind of world, anyway?

154
00:10:49,258 --> 00:10:54,195
Because despite everything, despite all of
it, he still wants to offer you salvation.

155
00:10:58,602 --> 00:11:02,197
Our child will bring that salvation,
but only if you accept your role...

156
00:11:02,232 --> 00:11:04,819
as her father
and her guardian.

157
00:11:08,747 --> 00:11:10,977
I'm not ready for that,
all right?

158
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:14,110
I'm not a father,
I'm not a guardian.

159
00:11:14,763 --> 00:11:19,291
I'm not a moral leader capable of
leading anyone, let alone a baby.

160
00:11:19,594 --> 00:11:21,061
Be a man, Gaius.

161
00:11:22,058 --> 00:11:23,047
What?

162
00:11:24,138 --> 00:11:27,767
Be a man. Whatever else
you are, you are that.

163
00:11:28,426 --> 00:11:31,293
The time is coming when
you'll have to act like one.

164
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:38,403
(Tyrol) Wait a minute, wait a
minute. El-tee, check this out.

165
00:11:38,438 --> 00:11:40,039
(Crashdown)
What do you got, Chief?

166
00:11:40,042 --> 00:11:43,705
45 degrees east of the launcher,
you see that tree stump?

167
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:49,937
What the hell is that? It
looks like a dradis dish...

168
00:11:50,506 --> 00:11:53,066
or at least a Cylon version
of a dradis dish.

169
00:11:53,226 --> 00:11:56,127
It's probably salvaged
from the nose cone of a ship.

170
00:11:58,475 --> 00:12:00,966
They are building
an anti-aircraft battery.

171
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,872
Anti-aircraft? For what? There
are no other aircraft around here.

172
00:12:05,098 --> 00:12:07,272
<i>The Galactica's gonna send
a search and rescue team.</i>

173
00:12:07,307 --> 00:12:11,539
When they do, that's at least two Raptors
doing a low pass over the crash site.

174
00:12:12,203 --> 00:12:15,764
When those Raptors come looking for
us, risking their lives to rescue us...

175
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:17,682
The Cylons will
shoot them down.

176
00:12:26,763 --> 00:12:30,392
Seven birds down for repairs. Three
out on picket duty with the CAP.

177
00:12:31,018 --> 00:12:32,315
Com traffic, sir.

178
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,823
Priority messages are on top.
Cut to the chase, Captain.

179
00:12:34,858 --> 00:12:38,726
How long before you launch the SAR? Come
on, Dee, these are all marked priority.

180
00:12:38,761 --> 00:12:40,426
Sorry, sir.
That's how they came in.

181
00:12:40,461 --> 00:12:42,055
I'm cannibalizing
305 for parts.

182
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:45,102
Should be up in the air in,
I don't know, 90 minutes.

183
00:12:45,137 --> 00:12:48,115
90 minutes? We got men down
on that frakking planet!

184
00:12:52,427 --> 00:12:55,988
Get your head in the game. You do
your job or go back to the brig.

185
00:12:59,082 --> 00:13:01,016
Are all the members of
the Quorum in the Ward Room?

186
00:13:01,051 --> 00:13:02,128
All 12, sir.

187
00:13:02,218 --> 00:13:04,096
Don't suppose you want
to do this for me?

188
00:13:04,131 --> 00:13:05,928
Never was much
at public speaking, sir.

189
00:13:05,963 --> 00:13:07,815
So why are we here?
That's what I want to know.

190
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,863
What exactly is going on?
We have been cooped up in...

191
00:13:09,898 --> 00:13:12,327
Laura Roslin suborned mutiny
and sedition aboard this ship.

192
00:13:12,362 --> 00:13:16,321
She caused a key military asset
to be lost at a critical moment.

193
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:20,271
The Commander felt he had no
choice but to remove her from power.

194
00:13:20,306 --> 00:13:22,152
You've said that.
Several times.

195
00:13:22,187 --> 00:13:24,295
Well, I... You don't seem
to be listening, Colonel.

196
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:27,265
It does not matter what Adama felt,
he had absolutely no authority...

197
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,576
Adama knew exactly
what he was doing.

198
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,167
He was paving the way
to declare martial law...

199
00:13:32,202 --> 00:13:35,103
and usher in a military dictatorship.
Isn't that right, Colonel?

200
00:13:35,138 --> 00:13:37,314
(Tigh) I can't speak for the Commander.

201
00:13:40,522 --> 00:13:41,853
He's still in surgery.

202
00:13:41,866 --> 00:13:44,061
Well, you seem to be giving
the orders around here...

203
00:13:44,096 --> 00:13:46,738
so what exactly
are you planning to do?

204
00:13:47,307 --> 00:13:49,767
Are you declaring martial
law? Absolutely not.

205
00:13:49,802 --> 00:13:53,738
I know for a fact that the old man
hated the very idea of martial law.

206
00:13:54,314 --> 00:13:58,375
He believed in freedom and
democracy, and all that good stuff.

207
00:13:58,667 --> 00:14:02,899
Well, since this is still a
democracy and "all that good stuff"...

208
00:14:03,115 --> 00:14:06,482
I move that the Quorum demand
immediate access to President Roslin.

209
00:14:06,517 --> 00:14:08,037
Excellent. I second it.

210
00:14:08,362 --> 00:14:10,193
(Porter)
All those in favor?

211
00:14:10,228 --> 00:14:11,176
(all)
Aye.

212
00:14:11,242 --> 00:14:12,368
(Zarek)
Aye.

213
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,573
Motion carries.

214
00:14:14,602 --> 00:14:17,537
Colonel, we demand immediate
access to the President.

215
00:14:24,778 --> 00:14:27,838
I will take your "demand"
under advisement.

216
00:14:29,098 --> 00:14:30,190
(Ellen)
Madam President.

217
00:14:30,218 --> 00:14:32,846
...anything that impedes
that understanding...

218
00:14:32,881 --> 00:14:34,175
Madam President?

219
00:14:34,538 --> 00:14:36,733
I have to consider...
Laura?

220
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,542
Laura?

221
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:49,715
Hello.
Hi.

222
00:14:50,346 --> 00:14:51,745
Are you all right?

223
00:14:57,226 --> 00:15:01,458
I just came down to see if there
was anything I could do for you.

224
00:15:01,493 --> 00:15:02,981
Anything I can get you?

225
00:15:11,946 --> 00:15:16,440
I would like to have a conversation
with my attorney. Could you arrange that?

226
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,849
Yeah, sure, right.

227
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,395
Laura,
do you know where you are?

228
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,764
I'm in jail.

229
00:15:28,554 --> 00:15:32,046
What's my name?
Have we met?

230
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:35,801
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

231
00:15:36,618 --> 00:15:40,418
It's just the ringing.
Excuse me.

232
00:15:40,714 --> 00:15:42,011
The ringing?

233
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,479
Right.

234
00:15:50,891 --> 00:15:53,689
Okay, then. Take care.

235
00:15:54,379 --> 00:15:56,813
[Groaning]

236
00:15:58,186 --> 00:15:59,653
[Metal clangs]

237
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:09,216
Oh, my gods.
Ellen Tigh.

238
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:10,791
Ellen?

239
00:16:13,322 --> 00:16:14,311
Ellen.

240
00:16:25,707 --> 00:16:27,197
Lords of Kobol...

241
00:16:51,275 --> 00:16:53,903
(Crashdown) The launcher looks
like a simple point and shoot...

242
00:16:53,938 --> 00:16:55,493
no built-in guidance.

243
00:16:55,658 --> 00:16:58,149
(Tyrol) Ordnance appear to be
standard ship-to-ship missiles.

244
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,647
They're modifying it
for atmospheric flight.

245
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,934
(Cally) One Cylon Centurion
walks the perimeter...

246
00:17:02,969 --> 00:17:04,822
stopping at
regular intervals.

247
00:17:05,962 --> 00:17:09,554
(Baltar) The dradis dish
that controls the missiles...

248
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:13,147
is on a 4.5 kG wavelength,
judging by the diameter.

249
00:17:13,738 --> 00:17:15,911
It's guarded by
two Centurions, I think.

250
00:17:15,946 --> 00:17:19,074
Sorry, Doc, did you say it
was guarded by two Centurions?

251
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:20,908
Yes, I did.

252
00:17:20,938 --> 00:17:24,271
Okay. Is the dradis guarded
continuously or intermittently?

253
00:17:26,154 --> 00:17:31,091
I saw two Centurions, through the field
glasses, continuously for five minutes.

254
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,998
In that time
they didn't leave their post.

255
00:17:48,906 --> 00:17:53,639
So there's three toasters near the
launcher, two more out by the dish.

256
00:17:54,154 --> 00:17:55,746
That's a lot of Cylons.

257
00:17:59,082 --> 00:18:00,811
You ever handle a weapon?

258
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:07,036
Who, me? No.

259
00:18:07,722 --> 00:18:09,607
I'm not a soldier, Crashdown.

260
00:18:09,642 --> 00:18:11,507
I'll try to give you
the most simple assignment...

261
00:18:11,542 --> 00:18:12,487
but I'm going to
need every man.

262
00:18:12,522 --> 00:18:15,303
(Tyrol) You're not suggesting
we attack the Cylons?

263
00:18:15,338 --> 00:18:19,900
We owe it to Socinus and Tarn to take those
frakkers out before they kill anyone else.

264
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:24,133
We have equal numbers. We
have the element of surprise.

265
00:18:24,168 --> 00:18:25,403
Therefore we have
the initiative.

266
00:18:25,418 --> 00:18:28,251
We can attack at a time
and place of our choosing.

267
00:18:32,938 --> 00:18:35,338
El-tee, a word in private.

268
00:18:40,362 --> 00:18:43,559
He's crazy. I'm not trained
for this kind of thing.

269
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:45,854
I've never fired
a gun in my life.

270
00:18:45,866 --> 00:18:47,857
I haven't fired one
since Basic.

271
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:52,269
You? I just joined to
pay for dental school.

272
00:18:57,354 --> 00:18:59,948
Basic Ground Assault was a
long time ago for all of us.

273
00:18:59,983 --> 00:19:01,506
Those aren't training
officers out there...

274
00:19:01,514 --> 00:19:03,943
they're programmed killing
machines. We don't have any choice.

275
00:19:03,978 --> 00:19:06,394
<i>Galactica will definitely be
sending a search and rescue party.</i>

276
00:19:06,429 --> 00:19:08,883
It's just a matter of time. If
we don't take out that launcher...

277
00:19:08,918 --> 00:19:11,744
We can't go up against an armed
and defended position like that.

278
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:14,571
They'll wipe us out in the
first two minutes. That's enough!

279
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:20,042
Chief, look, under the circumstances,
it's important that you keep your cool.

280
00:19:20,842 --> 00:19:23,402
I don't believe I've
lost my cool. I disagree.

281
00:19:23,882 --> 00:19:27,501
Look, I don't want to attack the
launcher, either, but it's our duty.

282
00:19:27,536 --> 00:19:31,121
We owe it to the rescue party,
and we owe it to Socinus and Tarn.

283
00:19:33,034 --> 00:19:36,060
I fail to see what this has
to do with Socinus and Tarn.

284
00:19:36,095 --> 00:19:38,638
Maybe that's why I'm an
officer and you're not.

285
00:19:44,778 --> 00:19:45,870
Dismissed.

286
00:20:01,738 --> 00:20:04,707
(Crashdown) This briefing will outline
a plan of attack in five graphs.

287
00:20:04,742 --> 00:20:06,550
Graph 1: Situation.

288
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:10,439
Our situation is that we are stranded
on Kobol with a group of five Cylons...

289
00:20:10,474 --> 00:20:14,212
who are planning to use an AAU to
destroy any SAR aircraft sent to find us.

290
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:15,646
There are no other
friendly forces present.

291
00:20:15,657 --> 00:20:17,699
What's all this "graph"
business? Graph 2: Mission.

292
00:20:17,734 --> 00:20:19,687
It's a five paragraph order.
... to destroy the AAU...

293
00:20:19,722 --> 00:20:22,850
It's a Basic command tool. It's
taught at officer candidate school.

294
00:20:22,885 --> 00:20:27,424
It's just not usually used
this literally in the field.

295
00:20:29,034 --> 00:20:31,264
Graph 4: Execution.

296
00:20:31,594 --> 00:20:34,688
We will assault the Cylon launch
site from the northwest, using...

297
00:20:34,723 --> 00:20:35,794
Oh, come on!

298
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,107
This is absurd.

299
00:20:38,602 --> 00:20:43,130
What, we're taking on the Cylon
Army, are we? Us? Look at us.

300
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,225
What, with two rifles
and a canteen?

301
00:20:45,226 --> 00:20:47,079
Have you lost your mind...
That's enough, Doctor.

302
00:20:47,114 --> 00:20:50,515
Is it? Look, no disrespect, but
why are we always going uphill?

303
00:20:50,538 --> 00:20:52,551
Does anyone else think that
his plan is frakking nuts?

304
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:55,419
I'll tell you what's fair, this is
fair. We'll have a show of hands.

305
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:57,633
No! Absolutely not! Now everybody
who thinks it's unfair...

306
00:20:57,668 --> 00:20:59,271
This is not a democracy.
Well, it's not...

307
00:20:59,274 --> 00:21:02,019
The El-tee's in charge.
The El-tee's in charge.

308
00:21:02,054 --> 00:21:04,679
No ifs, no ands, no buts.
He say we go, we go!

309
00:21:04,714 --> 00:21:07,512
There's no questions. We've
already lost two men, Chief!

310
00:21:07,547 --> 00:21:09,764
How many more people
are we gonna lose?

311
00:21:13,226 --> 00:21:15,303
You need to sit down
and shut up right now.

312
00:21:15,338 --> 00:21:17,499
Nobody tells me to shut up.
I am the Vice President...

313
00:21:17,534 --> 00:21:20,007
You need to sit down
and shut up, right now.

314
00:21:28,298 --> 00:21:29,731
Your briefing, El-tee.

315
00:21:31,466 --> 00:21:32,831
Thank you, Chief.

316
00:21:34,442 --> 00:21:38,469
Graph 4: We will approach the Cylon
launch site from the northwest...

317
00:21:38,504 --> 00:21:41,506
using natural ground cover
to mask our approach.

318
00:21:42,122 --> 00:21:45,523
Our objective is the command
and control console.

319
00:21:45,897 --> 00:21:47,591
Once we reach this position...

320
00:21:47,626 --> 00:21:51,221
Cally, you're gonna
flank out to the left...

321
00:21:51,305 --> 00:21:53,063
making a feint on
the Cylon position...

322
00:21:53,098 --> 00:21:56,397
hopefully drawing their fire
long enough for me and Seelix...

323
00:21:56,432 --> 00:21:59,694
to flank out to the right
and get a shot at the console.

324
00:22:00,266 --> 00:22:04,999
Tyrol, you and the Vice President
will stay at position one...

325
00:22:05,034 --> 00:22:07,771
provide covering fire
for both flanking maneuvers.

326
00:22:08,714 --> 00:22:12,411
I have been given the opportunity
to perceive from the scriptures...

327
00:22:14,154 --> 00:22:17,681
In peace I believe...

328
00:22:19,466 --> 00:22:22,492
This is ridiculous.
Look.

329
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:26,160
She obviously needs her medication. I keep
trying to tell anyone that'll listen...

330
00:22:26,195 --> 00:22:29,025
It sounds like she's talking about
the scrolls of the Prophet Pythia.

331
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,028
I suppose.

332
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:32,716
Pythia foretold
the rise of a leader.

333
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:36,739
A leader who would lead
all humanity to salvation.

334
00:22:37,578 --> 00:22:38,943
So say the gods.

335
00:22:44,586 --> 00:22:46,611
You seem to know
a lot about the scriptures.

336
00:22:46,646 --> 00:22:47,967
I'm from Gemenon.

337
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:51,032
We believe in the literal
truth of the scriptures.

338
00:22:52,745 --> 00:22:56,374
Cpl. Venner, there's...

339
00:22:56,714 --> 00:23:00,172
<i>a drug that priests sometimes
use. It's called chamalla extract.</i>

340
00:23:06,697 --> 00:23:08,289
I guess it's happy hour.

341
00:23:08,298 --> 00:23:09,890
What's happy about it?

342
00:23:15,177 --> 00:23:17,372
Yeah. The old man's
still in surgery.

343
00:23:18,474 --> 00:23:19,463
[Sighing]

344
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:24,162
I got a boatload of politicians and
press demanding to see Laura Roslin.

345
00:23:24,874 --> 00:23:26,739
Let them.
Yeah, right.

346
00:23:27,338 --> 00:23:29,033
She's crazy.
I know.

347
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:30,934
No, no, really, Saul.

348
00:23:31,434 --> 00:23:34,801
She's lost it. I just went
down to the brig to see her.

349
00:23:34,836 --> 00:23:39,322
You did?
She's completely nuts.

350
00:23:39,914 --> 00:23:42,216
She doesn't even know
where she is anymore.

351
00:23:42,251 --> 00:23:44,519
You're kidding.
You should let them see her.

352
00:23:45,322 --> 00:23:49,053
The press, the Quorum,
all of them.

353
00:23:49,129 --> 00:23:53,361
I mean, the little school teacher's
mind has gone bye-bye and the...

354
00:23:53,577 --> 00:23:56,512
Vice President is
either missing or dead.

355
00:23:58,506 --> 00:24:03,375
That leaves you in unchallenged
command of this ship and this fleet.

356
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:05,802
Just until the old man
gets back on his feet.

357
00:24:06,186 --> 00:24:08,120
Well, of course.

358
00:24:15,498 --> 00:24:19,008
<i>(Apollo) Galactica, Apollo. We
are preparing to jump to Kobol.</i>

359
00:24:19,043 --> 00:24:22,518
Roger that, Apollo. You are
cleared to jump. Good hunting.

360
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:26,062
<i>Thank you, Galactica.
Let's go find our people.</i>

361
00:24:32,714 --> 00:24:35,740
Okay, cock the rifle, click
the safety, open the scope.

362
00:24:38,378 --> 00:24:41,211
Cock the rifle, click the
safety, open the scope.

363
00:24:41,802 --> 00:24:42,894
Cock the rifle...

364
00:24:42,922 --> 00:24:45,914
(No. 6) One of you will
turn against the others.

365
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:49,245
During the mission?
Yes.

366
00:24:49,961 --> 00:24:51,690
One of us will betray the others? Yes.

367
00:24:51,725 --> 00:24:53,281
During the attack?
Yes.

368
00:24:55,529 --> 00:24:59,488
But if the attack fails?
You'll die.

369
00:25:00,777 --> 00:25:05,043
Not me. I am God's instrument.

370
00:25:08,201 --> 00:25:10,101
God turned his back on Kobol.

371
00:25:10,698 --> 00:25:13,861
Turned his back on man and
the false gods he worshipped.

372
00:25:14,442 --> 00:25:16,740
What happens on Kobol
is not his will.

373
00:25:17,226 --> 00:25:18,750
(Crashdown)
Saddle up.

374
00:25:21,193 --> 00:25:23,184
It's time to junk
some toasters.

375
00:26:00,105 --> 00:26:01,800
[Phone ringing]

376
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:11,030
<i>XO. (Dualla) Combat. Dualla here, sir.</i>

377
00:26:11,146 --> 00:26:13,254
The Quorum is demanding
to see the former President.

378
00:26:13,289 --> 00:26:16,359
They're being pretty adamant, and
they're giving the sentries a hard time.

379
00:26:16,394 --> 00:26:19,852
Well, maybe we should tell them to shove
their demand up their collective asses.

380
00:26:19,887 --> 00:26:21,083
How about that?

381
00:26:26,729 --> 00:26:29,527
Yes, sir. I need
instructions for the sentries.

382
00:26:29,801 --> 00:26:30,995
<i>They're asking
how to respond.</i>

383
00:26:31,017 --> 00:26:33,287
Tell them that they are
going to get to see...

384
00:26:33,322 --> 00:26:37,452
what has become of their precious
President. You tell them that.

385
00:26:56,233 --> 00:26:58,929
I got a transponder signal.
Definitely Colonial.

386
00:26:58,964 --> 00:27:00,721
Trying to establish a lock.

387
00:27:02,057 --> 00:27:03,046
Got it.

388
00:27:04,394 --> 00:27:07,830
Northern hemisphere. Looks
like mountainous terrain.

389
00:27:07,865 --> 00:27:09,276
There's a valley.

390
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:11,357
Take us out of orbit.

391
00:27:11,657 --> 00:27:13,989
<i>Signal Raptor 2
to form up on us.</i>

392
00:27:29,129 --> 00:27:33,225
There they are, all three of them,
right where they're supposed to be.

393
00:27:33,354 --> 00:27:35,218
All right, people.
This is it. We're going in.

394
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:37,643
Cally, you move up
the tree line to point alpha.

395
00:27:37,678 --> 00:27:40,034
Whoa, El-tee. There's five
Cylons at the launcher.

396
00:27:40,426 --> 00:27:41,415
What?

397
00:27:46,986 --> 00:27:49,477
Something's wrong, isn't it?
Something's wrong with the plan?

398
00:27:49,512 --> 00:27:51,144
Quiet down,
there's nothing wrong.

399
00:27:51,146 --> 00:27:53,510
There's just a couple Cylons
that we didn't account for.

400
00:27:53,545 --> 00:27:56,633
That makes for seven Cylons,
five here and two up at the dish.

401
00:27:56,668 --> 00:27:59,722
Are you absolutely certain
about the two guards at the dish?

402
00:28:01,417 --> 00:28:03,078
I know what I saw.

403
00:28:03,914 --> 00:28:06,883
Maybe there are only five Cylons.
They just changed their deployment.

404
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:09,225
They brought the two that were
guarding the dish down here.

405
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,990
Now the dish
is unprotected.

406
00:28:12,041 --> 00:28:15,062
God, Chief, that dish is,
like, almost a klick away.

407
00:28:15,097 --> 00:28:17,676
So what? It's unprotected.
We can go take it out.

408
00:28:17,711 --> 00:28:20,256
We don't have to take on
the whole Cylon army.

409
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:21,531
[Rumbling]

410
00:28:24,617 --> 00:28:27,177
What the hell was that?
Sonic booms.

411
00:28:27,337 --> 00:28:28,929
Spacecraft entering
the upper atmosphere.

412
00:28:28,938 --> 00:28:31,736
It's the SAR mission. They're
here. They're right up there, Chief.

413
00:28:31,771 --> 00:28:33,670
We got to go. There's
no time for discussion.

414
00:28:33,705 --> 00:28:35,526
All right, everyone up,
move out. It's game time.

415
00:28:35,561 --> 00:28:39,019
We're taking out these toasters
before they kill any more of us.

416
00:28:43,113 --> 00:28:46,446
[Breathing heavily]

417
00:28:48,457 --> 00:28:50,584
Cally, I said move.
I can't.

418
00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:54,844
What? That's an order.

419
00:28:55,241 --> 00:28:58,098
She doesn't have to. We could
just go take out the dish!

420
00:28:58,133 --> 00:29:00,870
Cally, you have to move.
Cally, this is not a joke. Go!

421
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,396
This is not a game, Cally, go!
We have people counting on us.

422
00:29:03,431 --> 00:29:05,127
They're up there, Cally.
Move!

423
00:29:05,162 --> 00:29:08,365
Listen to me, we still have time to
double back and take out the dish.

424
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,568
Shut up for a second, Cally. Cally.
Specialist, you have your orders.

425
00:29:11,603 --> 00:29:13,761
I need you to go up there
and create a distraction, now!

426
00:29:13,796 --> 00:29:16,006
Move! Move!
El-tee.

427
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:18,771
There were only supposed to be
three Cylons and now there are five.

428
00:29:18,806 --> 00:29:21,197
How are we supposed
to take on five Cylons?

429
00:29:21,232 --> 00:29:22,560
Frak orders,
frak court martial!

430
00:29:22,569 --> 00:29:24,599
Our people are up there,
we have to save them.

431
00:29:24,634 --> 00:29:26,629
We don't have any time.
Move! I can't do it.

432
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:28,398
Cally! Move!
No!

433
00:29:30,057 --> 00:29:31,149
Chief!

434
00:29:31,178 --> 00:29:34,113
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.
Put it down. Put it down.

435
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:35,751
You are going out there,
Cally.

436
00:29:35,786 --> 00:29:40,416
You're going out there, or I'm going to
blow your brains out. Right here, right now.

437
00:29:40,522 --> 00:29:44,754
Put it down. Hey, El-tee,
easy. Take it easy.

438
00:29:44,789 --> 00:29:46,378
I'm gonna count to three.

439
00:29:46,857 --> 00:29:49,417
This is crazy, this is crazy!

440
00:29:49,452 --> 00:29:50,374
One.

441
00:29:52,777 --> 00:29:54,335
Put it down. Right now.

442
00:29:54,345 --> 00:29:55,369
(Seelix)
Oh, my gods!

443
00:29:55,401 --> 00:29:56,629
Listen to me!

444
00:29:56,809 --> 00:29:58,800
Drop your weapon!
Two.

445
00:29:58,835 --> 00:30:00,090
[Cally sobbing]

446
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:03,410

Come on, Doc! Let's go!

Glad to see you hold the
President in such high esteem.

481
00:34:02,115 --> 00:34:05,324
Your day's gonna come,
laughing boy. Let's go.

482
00:34:06,537 --> 00:34:08,334
(Porter)
What is she saying?

483
00:34:12,201 --> 00:34:14,897
(Bagot) I don't know.
She's not saying anything.

484
00:34:14,953 --> 00:34:16,648
I don't know what to do.

485
00:34:17,865 --> 00:34:19,389
I feel like she's...

486
00:34:19,401 --> 00:34:21,767
All right, the show's over.
Let's give her some privacy.

487
00:34:21,802 --> 00:34:23,782
Everybody out. Let's go
back to the Ward Room...

488
00:34:23,817 --> 00:34:27,462
and we'll talk about the business
of how we proceed from here.

489
00:34:27,497 --> 00:34:31,108
Thank you all for coming. I have
a statement I'd like to make.

490
00:34:33,673 --> 00:34:37,473
The attempted military coup against
the lawful government of the Colonies...

491
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:40,821
is illegal, ill-advised,
and clearly doomed to failure.

492
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:44,996
I have not resigned the presidency,
and I will fight this action...

493
00:34:45,031 --> 00:34:46,770
with everything
at my command.

494
00:34:46,805 --> 00:34:48,319
She's crazy.
She's nuts.

495
00:34:48,329 --> 00:34:50,790
She thinks she's a prophet
or some such nonsense.

496
00:34:50,825 --> 00:34:53,190
Go ahead and ask her.
Ask her, she'll tell you.

497
00:34:53,225 --> 00:34:56,828
Just listen to her. What was
it? The Arrow of Apollo...

498
00:34:56,863 --> 00:35:00,432
will open the tomb of Artemis,
or some such nonsense.

499
00:35:00,467 --> 00:35:02,694
Everything I have done
is consistent, logical.

500
00:35:02,729 --> 00:35:06,214
We have found Kobol. We have
found the city of the gods.

501
00:35:06,249 --> 00:35:10,345
And when we retrieve the Arrow,
we will open the tomb of Athena...

502
00:35:10,889 --> 00:35:13,119
and we will find
the road to Earth.

503
00:35:14,217 --> 00:35:17,596
Madam President, have you
read the scrolls of Pythia?

504
00:35:17,631 --> 00:35:20,976
Carefully and many times,
and I humbly believe that...

505
00:35:21,011 --> 00:35:23,840
I am fulfilling
the role of the leader.

506
00:35:26,761 --> 00:35:28,821
Okay, enough of this nonsense.
Everybody out.

507
00:35:28,856 --> 00:35:30,822
I don't think so.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute!

508
00:35:30,857 --> 00:35:33,759
Sarah, you represent Gemenon,
you know more about the scrolls...

509
00:35:33,794 --> 00:35:37,173
and the scriptures than anybody
else here. Why don't you speak up?

510
00:35:37,208 --> 00:35:40,553
The scrolls tell us that a dying
leader will lead us to salvation.

511
00:35:40,588 --> 00:35:42,391
She's not dying,
she's crazy.

512
00:35:42,697 --> 00:35:43,959
I am dying.

513
00:35:45,353 --> 00:35:49,585
I have terminal breast cancer. Dr.
Cottle will verify the diagnosis.

514
00:35:51,049 --> 00:35:52,914
I have a few months to live.

515
00:35:53,993 --> 00:35:57,986
And in that time, I will
lead the people to salvation.

516
00:35:58,021 --> 00:35:59,831
It is my sole purpose.

517
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:03,125
Praise be to the gods.

518
00:36:04,137 --> 00:36:06,128
Here is our salvation.

519
00:36:16,201 --> 00:36:17,498
Sergeant of the Guard!
(Sergeant) Yes, sir.

520
00:36:17,513 --> 00:36:21,381
Remove these people from the brig
and escort them back to their shuttle.

521
00:36:21,833 --> 00:36:23,960
[All chattering]

522
00:36:49,705 --> 00:36:53,539
Thank you, Corporal.
Thank the gods.

523
00:37:04,233 --> 00:37:05,427
[Sighing]

524
00:37:05,449 --> 00:37:07,747
It's a hell
of a butcher's bill, Chief.

525
00:37:10,985 --> 00:37:14,352
How did Crashdown die?
Leading the charge.

526
00:37:17,897 --> 00:37:22,095
He gave his life in the finest
tradition of the service.

527
00:37:33,193 --> 00:37:37,892
Yeah.
He was a hero to the end.

528
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:52,550
[Sighing]

529
00:37:53,129 --> 00:37:54,892
I'm so proud of you, Gaius.

530
00:37:57,737 --> 00:37:58,795
Why?

531
00:38:01,256 --> 00:38:04,384
Because I've taken a life?
It makes you human.

532
00:38:07,497 --> 00:38:08,486
Is it...

533
00:38:10,697 --> 00:38:12,392
not conscious thought...

534
00:38:13,609 --> 00:38:18,444
not poetry, or art,
or music, literature.

535
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:25,284
Murder.
Murder is my heritage.

536
00:38:26,889 --> 00:38:29,949
Is that the lesson I'm supposed
to pass on to our child?

537
00:38:33,065 --> 00:38:34,930
Lt'll be all right, Gaius.

538
00:38:36,809 --> 00:38:40,267
Hey, Doctor, let's go!
Doctor, come on! We got to go!

539
00:38:43,817 --> 00:38:45,512
I'll be your conscience.

540
00:38:46,185 --> 00:38:49,052
(Apollo) Come on, Doctor!
We got to get out of here!

541
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,850
He'll live.

542
00:39:11,401 --> 00:39:12,766
When will he wake up?

543
00:39:12,777 --> 00:39:15,541
Knowing him, when he damn
well wants to, probably.

544
00:39:20,521 --> 00:39:23,388
I really frakked things
up for you, Bill.

545
00:39:33,801 --> 00:39:37,231
<i>The events which took place aboard
Colonial One are unfortunate.</i>

546
00:39:37,266 --> 00:39:40,662
<i>Laura Roslin's actions in
suborning mutiny and sedition...</i>

547
00:39:40,697 --> 00:39:42,758
<i>among the military
could not be tolerated.</i>

548
00:39:42,793 --> 00:39:45,591
<i>Therefore, Commander Adama
was left with no choice...</i>

549
00:39:45,626 --> 00:39:47,739
<i>other than to
remove her from office.</i>

550
00:39:47,753 --> 00:39:51,046
<i>Miss Roslin is now resting
comfortably aboard this ship...</i>

551
00:39:51,081 --> 00:39:54,881
<i>where she will remain until such
time as the Commander deems otherwise.</i>

552
00:39:54,916 --> 00:39:56,258
[All chattering]

553
00:39:56,264 --> 00:39:58,501
<i>As it appears obvious
that the government...</i>

554
00:39:58,536 --> 00:40:01,369
<i>cannot function under
the current circumstances...</i>

555
00:40:01,512 --> 00:40:04,538
<i>I have decided to dissolve
the Quorum of Twelve...</i>

556
00:40:06,312 --> 00:40:09,543
<i>and as of this moment,
I have declared martial law.</i>

557
00:40:09,737 --> 00:40:14,231
[Reporters clamoring]

558
00:40:41,641 --> 00:40:44,337
- Get those people the hell
off my ship.  -Yes, sir.
