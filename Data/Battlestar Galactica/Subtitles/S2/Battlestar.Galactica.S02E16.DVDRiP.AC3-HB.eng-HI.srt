00:29:17,727 --> 00:29:19,797
Lee got hit by friendly fire.

357
00:29:21,727 --> 00:29:23,399
I think it was me.

- I can't stop the bleeding.

361
00:29:44,647 --> 00:29:46,638
I gotta stop the bleeding.

362
00:29:47,127 --> 00:29:49,277
I can't tell if it hit an artery.

You know where to find them.

And he wasn't just her husband.
He was my brother.

My brother died on Picon.
He was a good man, too.

They're all good men.

387

The Abinell woman sent over a manifesto
to the press

before they took over the bar.

389
00:31:54,007 --> 00:31:56,726
It's mostly a collection of rumour
and conspiracy theories

about Cylons in the military
and the government.

391

Bunch of crap.

392
00:32:00,327 --> 00:32:03,046

We gotta get our people out of there.

The pressure door to the room

00:32:07,687 --> 00:32:10,155
If we try blowing it open,
we'll need so much G4

396
00:32:10,247 --> 00:32:12,203
we'd risk killing everyone inside.

There are no options left except for one.

No. We don't strike deals with terrorists.
We can't.

399
00:32:18,727 --> 00:32:21,241
We give them Sharon Valerii,

400
00:32:21,327 --> 00:32:24,285

You know that.

Gentlemen, everyone in that room

00:32:25,967 --> 00:32:29,198
is someone's son, someone's wife,
someone's mother.

403

Billy is the closest thing that I have to family
left in this world.

404
00:32:32,847 --> 00:32:36,362
And if you don't think that
that confuses things emotionally for me...

What if Sharon has been playing us all,

408

with every passing day?

409
00:32:44,247 --> 00:32:46,078
What if the terrorists are right?

410
00:32:46,367 --> 00:32:49,882
This isn't about Sharon.
It's about something much bigger than that.

411
00:32:49,967 --> 00:32:51,844
It's about the long-term survival.

412
00:32:51,927 --> 00:32:55,078
It's about the way we conduct ourselves
in all of this.

413

Sir, it's Abinell on the line.

414

<i>So are two of your soldiers.

417
00:33:09,927 --> 00:33:12,680
You know, I thought a long time about this.

418
00:33:13,367 --> 00:33:16,916
About what I'd do.
About how far I'd go.

419

Hold your fire.

I'm giving you the Cylon,

430
00:33:51,287 --> 00:33:52,606
but she won't be alive.

431
00:33:52,687 --> 00:33:54,996
What does that mean?
That is not the deal.

432
00:33:55,087 --> 00:33:59,046
It means that you've convinced me
that we may have been played.

433
00:33:59,127 --> 00:34:01,766
And if that be the case, and she's been
playing with me,
