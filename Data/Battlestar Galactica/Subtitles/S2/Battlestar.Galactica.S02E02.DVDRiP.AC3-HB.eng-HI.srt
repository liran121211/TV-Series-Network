00:00:26,805 --> 00:00:28,466

the way to Earth.

She's carrying my child!

Bitch took my ride.

8
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:47,054
(Tigh) I am placing you under arrest,
Madam President.

9
00:00:47,156 --> 00:00:48,748
This is mutiny.
You know that.

10
00:00:49,684 --> 00:00:52,778
(Adama) I'm terminating your
presidency, as of this moment.

11
00:00:53,045 --> 00:00:55,709
I recommend we execute jump to
emergency standby coordinates.

12
00:00:55,765 --> 00:00:57,394
What about our people
on the surface of Kobol?

13

If they're still alive,
they'll have to wait.

He's not gonna make it.

15
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:04,293
Tarn, you forgot the med kit, so
you're gonna have to go back and get it.

I know that I haven't really

But?

38
00:02:32,148 --> 00:02:35,313
But you were too busy helping the
President spark a mutiny on my ship.

39
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:38,013
Or, but you wanted to wait
until you were desperate...

40

It's the virus, sir.

I think it must have spawned copies of
itself in some of the computer systems.

Okay, sickbay is the safest spot.

133
00:08:34,101 --> 00:08:37,664

Okay, Billy.
You ever handled a weapon before?

No, thank you. I can't.

Yes, sir.

00:08:58,612 --> 00:09:01,640
You're in charge of getting her down
to sickbay. Take Bonnington as escort.

142
00:09:01,684 --> 00:09:03,814
Remember, just head away
from the sound of gunfire.

the outlying air bases...

157

see if we can find a Raptor.

158
00:09:36,372 --> 00:09:38,465
It's not exactly
what I expected.

159
00:09:38,548 --> 00:09:41,949
I thought I'd be stepping over decaying
corpses in the streets.

160
00:09:42,388 --> 00:09:44,788
Yeah, we saw a few bodies
here and there.

161
00:09:44,948 --> 00:09:48,577
Not much though.

00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,483
Okay, I was fooled by her.
She fooled me. You happy now?

167
00:10:08,596 --> 00:10:11,090
It's not about making me happy.
Then what's it about?

168
00:10:11,156 --> 00:10:15,117
What do you want here? You want
me to say I'm a frakking idiot? Okay.

169
00:10:15,124 --> 00:10:18,252
I'm a frakking idiot.
That make you feel better?

170
00:10:18,676 --> 00:10:22,708
I don't care anymore.
I've been here for months, by myself...

171
00:10:22,804 --> 00:10:25,364
on the run,
one step ahead of the Cylons.

172
00:10:29,044 --> 00:10:31,842
With the Cylons,
I guess, actually.

173
00:10:37,908 --> 00:10:40,172
She seemed so real.

174
00:10:41,844 --> 00:10:43,539
Like Sharon, you know?

175
00:10:44,212 --> 00:10:48,546
Same grin, same laugh,
all the little things.

176
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,274
I fell in love with a machine.

177
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:07,288
It's stupid, so just call me an idiot,
and let's be done with it.

178
00:11:07,605 --> 00:11:11,598
You're an idiot.
All right? You're an idiot.

179
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:17,039
But the Cylons have a way
of making all of us look like idiots.

180
00:11:26,676 --> 00:11:29,306
Kara, what are you doing?
Making a pit stop.

181
00:11:29,364 --> 00:11:30,854
I've got something
I gotta pick up.

182
00:11:30,868 --> 00:11:34,531
Hey, we gotta keep going.
I got a place here, Helo.

183
00:11:35,124 --> 00:11:38,585
The Cylon virus spawned itself in our
subsystems before we broke the network.

184
00:11:38,612 --> 00:11:40,102
I had teams cleaning
each subsystem...

185
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,849
but it'll be at least an hour
before we restore main power.

186
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,597
Captain?
What few Marines we have...

187
00:11:44,692 --> 00:11:46,753
are assembling at their checkpoint,
but comm. Is spotty.

188
00:11:46,836 --> 00:11:48,360
Where are the Cylons?

189
00:11:48,372 --> 00:11:51,173
It looks like they split into two forces.
One moving forward...

190
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,747
Forward, one moving aft.
Yes, sir.

191
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:58,519
I've seen this before.
These are their objectives:

192
00:11:59,572 --> 00:12:03,238
Secondary Damage Control
and Auxiliary Fire Control, sir.

193
00:12:03,252 --> 00:12:06,588
If they're successful, they will
override our decompression safeties...

194
00:12:06,612 --> 00:12:08,409
and vent us all into space.

195
00:12:08,788 --> 00:12:12,715
Once we're all dead, they'll turn the
ship's guns on the fleet and wipe it out...

196
00:12:12,724 --> 00:12:14,089
once and for all.

197
00:12:38,451 --> 00:12:40,112
[Wind blowing]

198
00:12:53,396 --> 00:12:54,624
Dr. Baltar.

199
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:07,811
How, in God's name,
did you find us?

200
00:13:13,908 --> 00:13:15,535
What do you have there?

201
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,283
It's a child, obviously.

202
00:13:22,932 --> 00:13:23,990
A child?

203
00:13:25,491 --> 00:13:27,186
Can I hold it?

204
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:30,934
Please.

205
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,781
Is this the shape
of things to come?

206
00:13:49,908 --> 00:13:51,603
That's my understanding.

207
00:13:58,548 --> 00:14:00,379
Only one thing for it, then.

208
00:14:05,332 --> 00:14:06,424
Commander?

209
00:14:07,316 --> 00:14:12,049
Please! Commander, where are you going?
Come back!

210
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,490
Commander!

211
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,663
Commander!
Commander.

212
00:14:25,076 --> 00:14:26,475
Commander, please.

213
00:14:50,388 --> 00:14:51,412
No!

214
00:14:52,084 --> 00:14:54,018
[Shushing]

215
00:14:56,532 --> 00:14:57,999
He killed our baby.

216
00:14:59,219 --> 00:15:00,277
Our baby?

217
00:15:01,236 --> 00:15:04,797
Adama,
I saw him drown the baby.

218
00:15:07,732 --> 00:15:12,635
Why would anyone want to drown a baby?
Gaius, the answer is all around us.

219
00:15:24,244 --> 00:15:26,838
What happened here?
Human sacrifice.

220
00:15:27,764 --> 00:15:30,927
Not the fairytales
your scriptures would have you believe.

221
00:15:31,859 --> 00:15:34,853
I thought Kobol was supposed
to be a paradise, or something.

222
00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:37,459
Some place where...

223
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,741
gods lived with the humans
in harmony, or...

224
00:15:40,788 --> 00:15:44,690
For a time, perhaps.
Then your true nature asserted itself.

225
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,476
Your brutality.
Your depravity. Your barbarism.

226
00:15:50,132 --> 00:15:52,123
So the scriptures
are all a lie.

227
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:57,954
It's all just a lie, just a cover-up
for all this savagery.

228
00:15:58,548 --> 00:15:59,674
Exactly.

229
00:16:00,404 --> 00:16:04,864
All of this has happened before,
Gaius, and all of it will happen again.

230
00:16:06,067 --> 00:16:07,159
Adama.

231
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,955
Mankind's true nature
will always assert itself.

232
00:16:13,524 --> 00:16:15,651
So he will try
and kill our baby.

233
00:16:18,195 --> 00:16:19,992
Only if you let him, Gaius.

234
00:16:21,396 --> 00:16:22,954
Only if you let him.

235
00:16:48,563 --> 00:16:50,963
Keep your eyes up ahead.
Come on.

236
00:16:52,755 --> 00:16:56,020
Come on.
Go! Go! Go! Go!

237
00:16:59,571 --> 00:17:01,038
Is it clear?
(Twinam) Yeah.

238
00:17:01,043 --> 00:17:02,840
Is it clear?
All decks, sir.

239
00:17:17,715 --> 00:17:19,444
(Apollo)
The keypad's dead.

240
00:17:32,115 --> 00:17:35,246
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
I'm human! (Kat) Jammer?

241
00:17:35,284 --> 00:17:38,745
Yes, sir, it's me. It's me, Jammer.
Jammer. Don't shoot. Please. It's Jammer.

242
00:17:38,772 --> 00:17:39,898
(Apollo)
Collishaw!

243
00:17:39,924 --> 00:17:41,448
(Collishaw) Sir!
Watch the hatch!

244
00:17:41,459 --> 00:17:44,419
Kat, Twinam, find those explosive rounds.
(Twinam) Sir.

245
00:17:44,468 --> 00:17:47,599
What the hell happened here? I don't
know, sir. I wasn't here in this fight.

246
00:17:47,635 --> 00:17:50,129
I just came in here to hide.
The Cylons are everywhere.

247
00:17:50,196 --> 00:17:52,087
All right, settle down.
You're gonna be just fine.

248
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:53,339
(Kat)
Apollo?

249
00:17:55,923 --> 00:17:59,657
You're kidding me. That's it?
Didn't have much to begin with, sir.

250
00:17:59,668 --> 00:18:03,163
The other fire teams must've come
and cleaned the locker out before us.

251
00:18:03,187 --> 00:18:06,020
Six rounds,
there are five of us.

252
00:18:06,548 --> 00:18:11,115
Okay, well, each of you guys take one.
I'll take the reload.

253
00:18:11,188 --> 00:18:14,353
You're not counting me, are you, sir?
I mean, I'm just...

254
00:18:14,388 --> 00:18:16,848
I'm just a knuckle dragger here.
I don't know to fight Centurions.

255
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,807
I don't know the first thing
about fighting Centurions.

256
00:18:18,899 --> 00:18:20,366
Come on, let's go.

257
00:18:22,356 --> 00:18:23,755
(Helo)
Let's do it.

258
00:18:23,924 --> 00:18:25,152
[Gun firing]

259
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,968
Never have your house keys
when you need them.

260
00:18:47,124 --> 00:18:51,254
These yours? You paint these, Kara?
Yeah.

261

<i>¤[music playing]</i>

262
00:19:39,668 --> 00:19:42,865
How the hell did you get power?
Batteries.

263
00:19:43,731 --> 00:19:47,326
Kept turning off the power.
Something about not paying the bill.

264
00:19:51,956 --> 00:19:54,049
That is definitely not you.

265
00:19:56,627 --> 00:19:58,026
It's my dad.

266
00:20:01,171 --> 00:20:06,040
Well, we've got one package of noodles.
You don't believe in groceries?

267
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:52,397
You know, I never really
liked this place, anyway.

268
00:20:52,467 --> 00:20:53,832
[Cigar cutter clicks]

269
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,785
Air conditioning
doesn't work in the summer.

270

Heater doesn't work in the winter.
The rent's a crime.

[Exclaims]

272
00:21:16,915 --> 00:21:19,179
After the attack, I never...

273
00:21:19,795 --> 00:21:22,559
never pined over
any of my old crap.

274
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,385
Never missed it.

00:21:28,531 --> 00:21:33,400
The stupid view of the parking lot,
broken toilet in the bathroom.

276
00:21:38,483 --> 00:21:43,443
You know, everyone I know
is fighting to get back what they had.

277
00:21:47,508 --> 00:21:50,306
I'm fighting 'cause I don't know
how to do anything else.

(Roslin)
How far to sickbay?

279
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:18,759
(Venner)
Sixty meters.

Oh, my gods, it's Dee.
Hey, are you all right?

283
00:22:47,251 --> 00:22:49,242
Yeah. I was going
to the head...

284
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:53,111
Oh, my gods, you're bleeding.
Went back to my rack.

285
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:55,639
Are you shot?
I forgot something.

Hey.

00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:19,942
I'm glad to see you.
I've been here in the dark a long time.

292
00:23:20,659 --> 00:23:22,456
It's probably a concussion.

293
00:23:23,731 --> 00:23:27,758
Cpl. Venner, we need
an alternate route to sickbay.

294
00:23:28,275 --> 00:23:30,971
Open your eyes.
Look at me.

295
00:23:32,275 --> 00:23:35,474
We don't want to walk into gunfire.
We want to go away from the Cylons.

296
00:23:35,507 --> 00:23:38,340
Now clear your head.
Come on.

297
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:43,776
We can go only... All the way on
the starboard side. It's a lot farther.

298
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:45,659
Good. Starboard, let's go.

Lt. Wallace reports his unit destroyed
two Centurions at this junction.

00:23:49,076 --> 00:23:50,739
They've trapped a third
in the ship's laundry.

301
00:23:50,835 --> 00:23:52,930
It can't walk,
but it's still shooting.

302
00:23:53,011 --> 00:23:55,744
At least we've contained
the threat to Auxiliary Fire Control.

303
00:23:55,796 --> 00:23:59,027
Trust me, they're still heading
for the Aft Damage Control.

on Deck 10 at frame 69.

307

the hull ahead of her...

308
00:24:11,443 --> 00:24:13,070

Smart move.
Keeps us from chasing them.

There's nothing between the last two
Cylons and the decompression safeties.

gotta get him the med kit.
Yeah. Get ready to go, Cally.

military operations, you understand me?

"Yes, sir!" Yes, sir.

about this place...

335
00:26:44,531 --> 00:26:45,555
Yeah, you and me both, Doc.

336
00:26:45,587 --> 00:26:48,388
(Tyrol) Flash. Flash!
Thunder.

337
00:26:48,435 --> 00:26:50,562
Go, go.
Here.

338
00:26:56,499 --> 00:26:57,727
Where's Tarn?

339
00:27:08,435 --> 00:27:11,199
What happened?
The Cylons.

340
00:27:13,651 --> 00:27:15,516
Were you followed?
No.

341
00:27:19,251 --> 00:27:23,017
How's he doing?
He's not gonna make it.

342
00:27:23,763 --> 00:27:24,855
What?

343
00:27:27,091 --> 00:27:28,683
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

344
00:27:28,691 --> 00:27:30,957
We got the med kit.
Give him a shot! Give him another shot!

345
00:27:31,027 --> 00:27:33,860
It's too late.
What do you mean it's too late?

346
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:39,546
I got you the med kit.
What else do you want?

347
00:27:40,339 --> 00:27:43,240
So we go get
the medicine you asked for.

348
00:27:44,307 --> 00:27:46,698
Tarn... For what?

349
00:27:46,771 --> 00:27:47,897
For this.

350
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:51,258
Come on,
you gotta do something.

351
00:27:53,939 --> 00:27:57,841
You have to do something.
I can't change that he's gonna die, Chief.

352
00:28:00,371 --> 00:28:03,536
It's going to be slow and painful,
and we can spare him that.

353
00:28:03,571 --> 00:28:06,269
We can spare him that
if we give him the morpha from my kit...

354
00:28:06,323 --> 00:28:08,484
and the one
that you brought back.

355
00:28:09,363 --> 00:28:10,421
What?

356
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,125
No.

357
00:28:18,867 --> 00:28:19,959
El-tee?

358
00:28:22,355 --> 00:28:25,324
El-tee, come on.
He's your man, Chief.

359
00:28:34,675 --> 00:28:37,667
Give it to me. Give it to me.

360
00:28:46,963 --> 00:28:48,191
Hey, buddy.

361
00:28:50,419 --> 00:28:52,546
It's Chief. How you doing?

362
00:28:54,163 --> 00:28:55,790
What's going on, Chief?

363
00:28:56,755 --> 00:29:00,020
Well, you know,
listening to the birds.

364
00:29:04,531 --> 00:29:06,965
I got a little something
for the pain.

365
00:29:23,923 --> 00:29:27,415
Good news, buddy.
We got a rescue party here.

366
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:28,757
Raptor just landed.

367
00:29:28,787 --> 00:29:32,188
<i>We're gonna put you on it
and take you back to Galactica. Okay?</i>

368
00:29:32,307 --> 00:29:33,774
We're going home?

369
00:29:35,443 --> 00:29:38,241
Yeah. We're going home.

370
00:30:11,218 --> 00:30:14,244
How're you coming, Jammer?
That should do it, Captain.

371
00:30:15,666 --> 00:30:18,729
Hey, nice job. You guys, check
the deck, check the lockers.

372
00:30:18,771 --> 00:30:20,901
There's gotta be more rounds in here.
Yes, sir.

373
00:30:20,979 --> 00:30:23,848
Combat, 12-8642,
Arms Locker.

374
00:30:23,891 --> 00:30:26,191
<i>Apollo here.
Colonel, it's Apollo.</i>

375
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:30,855
He's on Deck 12, aft frame 86, between
the Cylons and Aft Damage Control.

376
00:30:31,315 --> 00:30:33,683
Apollo, XO, sitrep.
Five armed effectives.

377
00:30:33,747 --> 00:30:36,648
We haven't seen anything but bodies
between here and the hangar deck.

378
00:30:45,331 --> 00:30:46,730
(Bonnington)
Clear.

379
00:30:47,123 --> 00:30:48,317
(Venner) Okay, from what
I can remember...

380
00:30:48,339 --> 00:30:51,172
the sickbay is about 20 meters
through that hatch.

381
00:30:56,307 --> 00:30:59,367
How you feeling?
Like I'm walking underwater.

382
00:31:03,187 --> 00:31:06,181
Any Marines with you?
(Apollo) Privates Collishaw, Twinam.

383
00:31:06,227 --> 00:31:09,890
Take your men and proceed without delay
to Aft Damage Control.

384
00:31:10,291 --> 00:31:11,553
Is that yours?

385
00:31:13,203 --> 00:31:15,433
Yeah, I guess it is now.

386
00:31:16,563 --> 00:31:19,828
Okay. If you're gonna keep it
in your trousers like that...

387
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:22,406
you might want to
turn the safety on.

388
00:31:23,699 --> 00:31:24,825
Great.

389
00:31:27,251 --> 00:31:28,741
(Venner)
Is it stuck?

390
00:31:29,139 --> 00:31:32,065
No, frak!
The hatch won't open.

391
00:31:32,114 --> 00:31:34,275
The other side's
been depressurized.

392
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:38,034
All right, Cpl. Venner, this is your ship.
I'm just a tourist.

393
00:31:38,067 --> 00:31:40,592
Find us another way to sickbay.
Okay.

394
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,538
Okay, we have to head toward
Aft Damage Control.

395
00:31:45,619 --> 00:31:47,086
Aft Damage Control.

396
00:31:47,091 --> 00:31:49,289
<i>(Apollo) Aft Damage Control?
That's what they're after.</i>

397
00:31:49,363 --> 00:31:52,596
<i>(Tigh) Let's not waste any more time.
You get to Aft Damage Control.</i>

398
00:31:52,626 --> 00:31:54,426
And get there
right frakking now, mister.

399
00:31:54,515 --> 00:31:58,042
Get there before the Cylons or we
lose the ship. Is that clear?

400
00:31:58,227 --> 00:32:00,821
Aft Damage Control. RFN.
On our way. Apollo out.

401
00:32:15,091 --> 00:32:16,683
(Apollo)
Okay. Hold on.

402
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:22,535
Okay, we made it.

403
00:32:23,795 --> 00:32:25,754
Twinam, Jammer, you take this side.
Yes, sir.

404
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:28,303
Kat, Collishaw, you take that side.
We're gonna need some cover.

405
00:32:28,371 --> 00:32:30,136
(Collishaw)
All right, let's move.

406
00:32:30,227 --> 00:32:32,354
Let's get this stuff out.
Yes, sir.

407
00:32:45,875 --> 00:32:46,899
Wait.

408
00:32:47,635 --> 00:32:49,500
[Guns firing]

409
00:32:51,283 --> 00:32:54,184
That's not so...
Okay, everybody, get down. Stay down.

410
00:32:56,531 --> 00:32:58,490
Hold your fire
till I give the signal.

411
00:32:58,579 --> 00:33:01,937
Remember, you only have one round, so
it's gotta be a headshot to make a kill.

412
00:33:01,971 --> 00:33:04,396
You understand? Understood?
Yes, sir.

413
00:33:04,467 --> 00:33:06,731
Kat, kill the flashlight.

414
00:33:10,898 --> 00:33:13,867
Take cover. Take cover.
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

415
00:33:23,763 --> 00:33:27,426
Steady up there, Jammer.
Yes, sir.

416
00:33:27,826 --> 00:33:31,762
Not really cut out for this, sir.
Me, neither.

417
00:33:33,971 --> 00:33:38,465
But sometimes you gotta roll the hard six.
What does that mean, sir?

418
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:43,310
I don't know.
It's something my dad says.

419
00:33:43,378 --> 00:33:47,474
Just don't shoot till I tell you to,
all right?

420
00:33:50,002 --> 00:33:52,869
Okay, we're in good shape.
They're coming.

421
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:55,431
But we're in good shape.

422
00:34:14,995 --> 00:34:16,553
[Thudding]

423
00:34:17,811 --> 00:34:21,144
Headshot. Reload. Headshot.

424
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:25,962
Headshot. Reload. Headshot.

425
00:34:26,547 --> 00:34:28,515
Reload. Headshot.

426
00:34:39,859 --> 00:34:42,157
Okay, they're coming.
Everybody down!

427
00:34:43,058 --> 00:34:45,754
You want to shoot that,
you have to take the safety off.

428
00:34:46,098 --> 00:34:48,692
[Footsteps thudding]

429
00:34:50,386 --> 00:34:51,614

[Guns firing]

432
00:35:01,171 --> 00:35:02,229
Fire!

[Screams]

435
00:35:37,747 --> 00:35:38,907
(Venner)
Hey.

436
00:35:40,883 --> 00:35:44,319
Are you all right?
Yes, I'm fine.

437
00:35:47,667 --> 00:35:50,101
We did it. We got them all!

438
00:35:51,795 --> 00:35:53,956
They don't look so big now,
do they?

439
00:35:57,074 --> 00:35:58,974
(Apollo)
They look big enough.

440
00:36:01,043 --> 00:36:02,305
(Kat)
Oh, gods.

441
00:36:05,458 --> 00:36:08,052
(Dualla) I'll take that.
Yeah.

442
00:36:08,435 --> 00:36:12,599
(Venner) Have you been shot?
No, I don't think so.

443
00:36:13,011 --> 00:36:15,343
Yeah?
Yeah, I'm fine.

444
00:36:21,203 --> 00:36:23,296
The gods must be
watching over you.

445
00:36:50,194 --> 00:36:51,559
Tired of walking?

446
00:37:09,586 --> 00:37:10,644
Okay.

447
00:37:14,707 --> 00:37:16,004
[Engine starts]

448
00:37:22,451 --> 00:37:23,509
Thanks.

449
00:37:26,739 --> 00:37:28,001
[Sighing]

450
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:34,616
Hey.

451
00:37:36,018 --> 00:37:38,748
How you feel?
Better.

452
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:50,882
I thought you said...
Forget what I said...

453
00:37:51,091 --> 00:37:54,686
and listen to what I'm saying.
Are you listening?

454
00:37:54,995 --> 00:37:56,087
[Grunts]

455
00:38:11,698 --> 00:38:12,756
I'm sorry.

456
00:38:14,803 --> 00:38:16,828
I didn't hear that.
Could you...

457
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:20,251
Could you do that one more time?
Come here. Let me be clear.

458
00:38:24,274 --> 00:38:25,639
Get the curtain.

459
00:38:31,954 --> 00:38:35,788
(Tigh) Doc Cottle's on his way.
He'll be here any minute.

460
00:38:45,138 --> 00:38:47,538
He's gonna be all right.
You know that.

461
00:38:51,186 --> 00:38:53,950
Yeah. Yeah, I know that.

462
00:38:58,258 --> 00:39:01,355
Colonel, I assume there's still
a cell out there waiting for me?

463
00:39:01,394 --> 00:39:02,622
That's right.

464
00:39:05,586 --> 00:39:07,213
Cpl. Venner, I'm ready.

465
00:39:15,987 --> 00:39:19,254
I can't believe you sided
with that woman against the old man.

466
00:39:19,282 --> 00:39:22,718
I wouldn't do that
if you put a gun to my head, and you did.

467
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:27,183
As far as I'm concerned,
you're not fit to wear a uniform.

468
00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:35,171
You're right about that part.
I am not fit to wear the uniform.

469
00:39:38,034 --> 00:39:39,626
And maybe I never was.

470
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:43,641
Then again,
neither were you.

471
00:39:48,562 --> 00:39:52,999
But this isn't my ship, and
it sure as hell isn't yours. It's his.

472
00:39:54,418 --> 00:39:59,355
And when he wakes up, he'll decide
what to do with the both of us.

473
00:40:32,146 --> 00:40:34,239
Thank the gods
I didn't have kids.

474
00:40:36,082 --> 00:40:37,481
[Metallic rolling]
