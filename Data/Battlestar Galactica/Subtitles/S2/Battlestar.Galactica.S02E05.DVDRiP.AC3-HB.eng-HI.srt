<i>(female narrator) Previously
on Battlestar Galactica.</i>

2
00:00:22,668 --> 00:00:24,363
I have a few months to live.

3
00:00:24,364 --> 00:00:28,232
And in that time, I will lead
the people to salvation.

4
00:00:28,268 --> 00:00:30,239
It is my sole purpose.

5
00:00:30,274 --> 00:00:32,211
Praise be to the Gods.

6
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,049
Here is our salvation.

7
00:00:35,084 --> 00:00:37,678
Laura Roslin's actions in
suborning mutiny and sedition...

8
00:00:37,713 --> 00:00:39,913
among the military
could not be tolerated.

9
00:00:39,948 --> 00:00:42,712
Therefore, Cdr. Adama
was left with no choice...

10
00:00:42,747 --> 00:00:44,500
other than to remove her
from office.

11
00:00:44,535 --> 00:00:46,253
We've got to
get out of here now.

12
00:00:46,288 --> 00:00:47,446
I'm right with you.

13
00:00:47,468 --> 00:00:49,428
I think these guys might
really be human.

14
00:00:49,463 --> 00:00:51,389
Everyone on Caprica's dead.
You're not.

15
00:00:51,424 --> 00:00:52,805
I just got here.

16
00:00:52,812 --> 00:00:54,074
Not exactly an army.

17
00:00:54,092 --> 00:00:55,684
A hell of a lot better
than the two of us...

18
00:00:55,692 --> 00:00:57,023
if we're gonna assault
an airbase...

19
00:00:57,036 --> 00:00:59,171
steal a Heavy Raider, and
get the frak off this planet.

20
00:00:59,206 --> 00:01:01,306
Nice to know installing
a regulation Pyramid court...

21
00:01:01,341 --> 00:01:03,351

of the Resistance.

Stand aside
or you can shoot me.

27
00:01:12,301 --> 00:01:15,361
I intend to go through that
hatch and get off this ship.

28
00:01:16,684 --> 00:01:18,379
The former president's missing. Missing?

29
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,463
Two men down. Cell's empty.
Damn it.

30
00:01:20,498 --> 00:01:22,547
(Apollo) Well, we're home free for now.

31
00:01:23,148 --> 00:01:24,638
Glad to see you,
Madam President.

32
00:01:24,652 --> 00:01:26,279
Zarek here
is the only one...

I love you, Chief.

38
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,835
What's happening on my ship?

39
00:01:37,836 --> 00:01:39,667
I frakked things up
and good.

40
00:01:40,012 --> 00:01:43,209
I made some bad calls.
A lot of pieces to pick up.

41
00:01:43,564 --> 00:01:45,361
Then we'll pick them up
together.

42
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:55,213
Go through.

46
00:02:23,788 --> 00:02:26,814
So what are you gonna do if you
can't make it back to your ship?

47
00:02:27,308 --> 00:02:28,502
I'm getting back.

48
00:02:28,588 --> 00:02:31,284
Well, I know we were able to
take your sorry ass by surprise.

49
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,438
Frak you.

50
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,587
Nice. But the truth is...

51
00:02:35,436 --> 00:02:37,417
we really don't know
what the hell we're doin'.

52
00:02:37,452 --> 00:02:40,285
A lot of our tactics are stuff
we just saw in the movies.

53
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,602
We could use
some professional advice.

54
00:02:43,724 --> 00:02:46,852
You want some advice? You're
on the losing end of this fight.

55
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,738
Give it up
before you all die.

Head further up
in the mountains...

57
00:02:50,924 --> 00:02:53,188
above the ambient radiation,
and just hole up.

58
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,014

If I say I'm gonna
do something, I do it.

in the morning?

66
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,876
So what?

67
00:03:19,692 --> 00:03:20,818
Mission.

69
00:03:22,156 --> 00:03:24,090
Fine. Whatever.

71
00:03:33,325 --> 00:03:34,952
I'm sorry, okay?

72
00:03:35,245 --> 00:03:36,439
I didn't mean to...

73

[laughs]

74
00:03:37,548 --> 00:03:38,606

75
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,048
So weak.
So, so very weak.

76
00:03:43,628 --> 00:03:47,291
Lighten up a little bit. It's
only the end of the world.

77

[Laughs]

78
00:04:06,348 --> 00:04:09,715
Sue-Shaun, I want you to watch our
perimeter, especially on the flank.

79
00:04:12,236 --> 00:04:13,225
Okay.

80
00:04:15,564 --> 00:04:18,658
The Cylons have a refueling airstrip
just on the other side of that ridge.

81
00:04:18,693 --> 00:04:20,834
There's a Heavy Raider makes
a regular refueling stop...

82
00:04:20,869 --> 00:04:22,473
every afternoon,
like clockwork.

83
00:04:22,956 --> 00:04:24,649
(Helo) Machines like routine. Yeah.

84
00:04:24,684 --> 00:04:27,482
It's usually guarded by less than
three of the mechanical varieties.

85
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,233
We've left it alone
up until now.

86
00:04:29,356 --> 00:04:31,324
(Helo)
So what's the plan?

87
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,401
Go through this gully, approach
the airstrip from the south side...

88
00:04:34,436 --> 00:04:36,009
sprinkle our men
through the tree line...

89
00:04:36,012 --> 00:04:37,479
wait for the Cylons
to land the Raider...

90
00:04:37,484 --> 00:04:40,180
hook up the refueling hoses. Once
they hook up the tylium hoses...

91
00:04:40,215 --> 00:04:42,768
we take out the guards and
blow their refueling station.

92
00:04:42,803 --> 00:04:44,791
I thought you wanted
the Raider intact?

93
00:04:45,228 --> 00:04:47,081
They build them tough.
Believe me.

94
00:04:47,116 --> 00:04:49,449
Blowing the fuel will barely
put a scratch on the hull...

95
00:04:49,484 --> 00:04:51,782
but it might give us enough
time to board the Raider.

96
00:04:51,817 --> 00:04:52,848
Once I'm inside...

97
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:55,470
I'll blow the brain, and I'll
start working on trying to get it...

111
00:06:59,948 --> 00:07:03,884
Thank you very much.
I'm glad to be back.

112
00:07:08,908 --> 00:07:11,138
There are things
we don't say often enough...

113
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:14,510
things like what we mean
to one another.

114
00:07:15,595 --> 00:07:18,120
All of you
mean a lot to me.

115
00:07:19,724 --> 00:07:21,521
I just want you
to know that.

116
00:07:26,316 --> 00:07:28,011
Let's get back to work.

117
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,551
I feel strange. Like...

118
00:07:40,907 --> 00:07:42,374
Closer to the ground.

119
00:07:42,475 --> 00:07:44,409
You should check in
with the doctor.

120
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,514
Mr. Gaeta? Where do
we think they are now?

121
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,987
The stolen Raptor
with Capt. Adama...

122
00:07:52,075 --> 00:07:53,542
and the former president.

123
00:07:53,548 --> 00:07:55,038
The fugitives.

124
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:59,669
<i>The fugitives docked
at Cloud 9 last week.</i>

125
00:07:59,884 --> 00:08:02,025
We effectively lost them
at that point...

126
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,587
<i>due to the large volume of inter-fleet
traffic going to and from Cloud 9.</i>

127
00:08:05,622 --> 00:08:08,075
By now, they could be holed up
anywhere in the fleet.

128
00:08:09,068 --> 00:08:10,501
I want them found.

129
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,776

as a symbol of Resistance...

130
00:08:15,211 --> 00:08:16,769
but now with Lee helping...

131
00:08:24,172 --> 00:08:26,333
I wanna search
every ship in the fleet.

132
00:08:26,828 --> 00:08:28,489
Quarantine procedures.

133
00:08:29,068 --> 00:08:31,536
Isolate the ship
out of the main body.

134
00:08:31,691 --> 00:08:36,060
If it's clean, we keep it quarantined
away from the rest of the fleet.

135
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:40,021
She can hide,
but she can't run.

136
00:08:41,324 --> 00:08:43,451
Dee, start
quarantine procedures.

137
00:08:43,819 --> 00:08:45,582

139
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,743
are we meant to stay hidden
in this meat locker?

140
00:08:57,778 --> 00:08:58,729
(Elosha)
I don't know.

141
00:08:58,764 --> 00:09:01,756
I communicated your latest
message to the Quorum of Twelve...

142
00:09:01,836 --> 00:09:05,397
and they've decided that the question
of openly supporting you needs more...

143
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,322
deliberation.

144
00:09:09,227 --> 00:09:11,354
I need to make
an appeal to the people.

145
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:14,314
Make a strong enough
argument...

146
00:09:14,444 --> 00:09:16,503
<i>and the Astral Queen will be
the first ship in line.</i>

147

[Apollo scoffs]

148
00:09:17,964 --> 00:09:20,990
Like they knew anything but roll
over and take orders from you.

149
00:09:21,804 --> 00:09:23,499
One more bit of news
I should convey.

150

151

My father? He's back?

154
00:09:35,692 --> 00:09:37,557

in over the wireless.

155

157
00:09:50,059 --> 00:09:53,512
(Zarek) What we really need
is something heartfelt...

158
00:09:53,547 --> 00:09:58,507
something human and personal
that will galvanize the people.

159
00:10:01,964 --> 00:10:05,923
Like a son
denouncing his father.

160
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:10,919
(Apollo)
My name is Lee Adama.

161
00:10:12,395 --> 00:10:15,592
<i>Until recently, I was the commander
of Galactica's air group...</i>

162
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,781
but when Cdr. Adama,
my father...

163
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,094
decided to stage a military
coup against the President...

164
00:10:22,129 --> 00:10:25,996
I could no longer support him
or his actions.

165
00:10:30,956 --> 00:10:32,446
I love my father.

166
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,333
I respect him.

167
00:10:35,691 --> 00:10:37,056
But in this...

168
00:10:38,251 --> 00:10:39,513
he is wrong.

169
00:10:40,491 --> 00:10:42,049
He must be opposed.

170
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:50,412
I call on all free-thinking
people in the fleet. I...

171
00:11:05,995 --> 00:11:10,056
I can't do this. Sorry, everyone.
I thought I could, but I can't.

172
00:11:21,963 --> 00:11:23,726
I'm playing
the religious card.

173
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,251
I know exactly
what I have to do.

174
00:11:32,331 --> 00:11:33,992
How does this thing work?

175
00:12:00,267 --> 00:12:01,529
(Simon)
You're okay.

176
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:08,488
You're in an aid hospital.

177
00:12:09,419 --> 00:12:11,410
They brought you in
yesterday morning.

178
00:12:12,268 --> 00:12:13,826
You got shot in the abdomen.

179
00:12:14,444 --> 00:12:15,672
I'm Simon.

180
00:12:17,707 --> 00:12:19,436
Can you tell me your name?

181
00:12:19,692 --> 00:12:20,852
Kara.

182
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,847
[Clears throat]

183
00:12:23,851 --> 00:12:25,113
Kara Thrace.

184
00:12:25,483 --> 00:12:26,848
[Inaudible]

185
00:12:28,844 --> 00:12:31,278
(Simon) You were in
surgery for about two hours.

186
00:12:31,435 --> 00:12:33,027
I removed the bullet.

187
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:36,857
I didn't think you were gonna
make it there for a while.

188
00:12:38,956 --> 00:12:40,014
Take it easy.

189
00:12:40,043 --> 00:12:41,032
[Coughs]

190
00:12:41,068 --> 00:12:42,228
I know that hurts.

191
00:12:45,676 --> 00:12:47,075
Who brought me in?

192
00:12:48,588 --> 00:12:50,385
(Simon)
This big guy named Anders.

193
00:12:51,468 --> 00:12:54,733
Used to be a pro Pyramid
player, if you can believe that.

194
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:56,641
Yeah, I know him.

195
00:12:57,036 --> 00:12:58,196
[Water running]

196
00:12:58,252 --> 00:12:59,446
Where is he?

197
00:13:06,732 --> 00:13:09,633
He died.
On the table.

198
00:13:10,411 --> 00:13:12,328
I thought he was
only slightly wounded.

199
00:13:12,363 --> 00:13:16,060
It turns out a piece of
shrapnel had nicked his aorta.

200
00:13:16,107 --> 00:13:18,132
Massive internal bleeding.

201
00:13:18,795 --> 00:13:21,821
I'm sorry. We did everything
we could do.

202
00:13:37,035 --> 00:13:38,434
[Door closes]

203
00:13:43,403 --> 00:13:44,665
[Crying]

204
00:13:59,788 --> 00:14:01,187
[Door opens]

205
00:14:02,027 --> 00:14:03,119
(Simon)
Good morning.

206
00:14:03,819 --> 00:14:07,186
I see you're sucking down fluids
at a rapid pace. That's good.

207
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:10,532
Are you a Cylon?

208
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,912
What do you think?

209
00:14:13,067 --> 00:14:15,048
I think you didn't
answer the question.

210
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:18,246
[Chuckling] I am most
definitely not a cylon.

211
00:14:18,763 --> 00:14:20,921
Of course, I don't know
what you'd expect me to say.

212
00:14:20,956 --> 00:14:23,079
If I was a Cylon,
I certainly wouldn't admit it.

213
00:14:23,244 --> 00:14:24,472
Can I leave?

214
00:14:25,804 --> 00:14:26,862
There's the door.

215
00:14:31,307 --> 00:14:32,569
[Sighing]

216
00:14:34,571 --> 00:14:36,198
Frakking doctors.

217
00:14:36,203 --> 00:14:38,433
So I am a doctor,
not a Cylon?

218
00:14:38,763 --> 00:14:40,230
The jury's still out.

219
00:14:41,739 --> 00:14:45,140
I would expect the Cylons to have
better digs than this, though.

220
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:46,975
Where is this rattrap?

221
00:14:46,988 --> 00:14:50,480
We're about 20 clicks north of Delphi.
Used to be a mental institution.

222
00:14:51,051 --> 00:14:54,714
It's not much, but it's one of the few
places the Cylons haven't found yet.

223
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:55,816
[Groans]

224
00:14:55,884 --> 00:14:56,908
Okay.

225
00:14:57,707 --> 00:15:00,767
So, what, I'm supposed to believe
there really is a Resistance out there?

226
00:15:00,802 --> 00:15:02,409
Shh. Don't tell anybody.

227
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:04,173
We're trying
to keep that quiet.

228
00:15:06,636 --> 00:15:08,103
Time for your pain meds.

229
00:15:14,572 --> 00:15:15,800
[Groans]

230
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:39,919
(Tyrol) If I may speak on
behalf of Specialist Cally?

231
00:15:40,588 --> 00:15:43,751
She was distraught through
the experience on Kobol.

232
00:15:43,786 --> 00:15:47,091
Being on the surface,
fighting the Cylons...

233
00:15:47,979 --> 00:15:50,004
it's shattering
for all of us.

234
00:15:51,756 --> 00:15:55,522
I don't believe she was in her
right mind when she shot Boomer.

235
00:15:55,557 --> 00:15:56,424
[Sighs]

236
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,189
Did you love her, Chief?

237
00:16:00,491 --> 00:16:01,651
Excuse me?

238
00:16:01,739 --> 00:16:03,502
Boomer. Did you love her?

239
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,912
I thought I did.

240
00:16:09,355 --> 00:16:11,983
When you think you love
somebody, you love them.

241
00:16:12,811 --> 00:16:15,143
That's what love is:
Thoughts.

242
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,941
She was a Cylon,
a machine.

243
00:16:24,075 --> 00:16:26,543
Is that what Boomer was?
A machine?

244
00:16:29,643 --> 00:16:30,769
A thing?

245
00:16:30,924 --> 00:16:32,721
That's what
she turned out to be.

246
00:16:32,971 --> 00:16:35,132
She was more than that
to us.

247
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,981
She was more than that to me.

248
00:16:39,564 --> 00:16:41,725
She was a vital,
living person...

249
00:16:43,051 --> 00:16:46,283
aboard my ship
for almost two years.

250
00:16:46,318 --> 00:16:49,515
She couldn't have been
just a machine.

251
00:16:54,603 --> 00:16:56,264
Could you love a machine?

252
00:17:01,515 --> 00:17:04,416
No, sir.
I guess I couldn't.

253
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:13,206
Cally discharged a firearm
without permission...

254
00:17:15,436 --> 00:17:18,166
endangering the lives
of her shipmates.

255
00:17:19,115 --> 00:17:21,015
Thirty days in the brig.

256
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:23,961
Dismissed.

257
00:17:25,067 --> 00:17:26,591
Thank you, sir.

258
00:17:27,243 --> 00:17:29,211
You'll see her again, Chief.

259
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:34,861
Excuse me?

260
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,064
There are many copies.

261
00:17:40,939 --> 00:17:42,634
You'll see her again.

262
00:17:58,059 --> 00:17:59,151
[Clears throat]

263
00:17:59,627 --> 00:18:01,492
How many patients
do you have here?

264
00:18:02,251 --> 00:18:04,151
Am I being
interrogated again?

265
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:05,843
I just think it's odd...

266
00:18:05,867 --> 00:18:08,563
that I've been here for two days,
and I haven't seen anybody else.

267
00:18:08,598 --> 00:18:09,615
Just you.

268
00:18:10,731 --> 00:18:12,904
We have 223 patients
at the moment...

269
00:18:12,939 --> 00:18:16,306
two doctors, and five teachers
masquerading as nurses.

270
00:18:16,555 --> 00:18:19,080
I know a teacher
masquerading as president.

271
00:18:19,756 --> 00:18:20,984
What's that?

272
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:23,167
It's awfully quiet.

273
00:18:24,075 --> 00:18:26,839
No screams, no moans, no...

274
00:18:27,403 --> 00:18:30,201
"Doctor! Doctor!
Please help me! It hurts."

275
00:18:32,459 --> 00:18:37,362
Most of our patients are succumbing
to acute radiation poisoning.

276
00:18:38,379 --> 00:18:43,214
Symptoms include powerful
fatigue and immediate nausea.

277
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:47,089
This is followed by several
days of comparable well-being.

278
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:51,996
After that, cell death in the gastric
and intestinal tissue causes...

279
00:18:52,171 --> 00:18:56,198
massive diarrhea, intestinal
bleeding, and loss of water.

280
00:18:59,051 --> 00:19:00,143
It's not pretty.

281
00:19:01,131 --> 00:19:03,827
But it is quiet.

282
00:19:05,515 --> 00:19:07,506
The biggest killer
in this place is infection.

283
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,256
That's why we have you
under quarantine.

284
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,451
We don't know what you
brought in with you yet.

285
00:19:11,486 --> 00:19:13,611
Your test results
will be back this afternoon.

286
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:20,082
Okay, almost done.

287
00:19:21,483 --> 00:19:24,316
I think there may be a cyst
on one of your ovaries.

288
00:19:24,491 --> 00:19:25,890
Is it serious?

289
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:27,526
No, it should be fine.

290
00:19:28,075 --> 00:19:29,474
We'll keep an eye on it.

291
00:19:29,484 --> 00:19:32,009
Gotta keep that reproductive
system in great shape.

292
00:19:32,044 --> 00:19:33,844
That's your most
valuable asset these days.

293
00:19:33,879 --> 00:19:34,859
Right.

294
00:19:35,787 --> 00:19:36,947
I'm serious.

295
00:19:36,971 --> 00:19:39,098
Finding healthy,
child-bearing women your age...

296
00:19:39,133 --> 00:19:41,052
is a top priority
for the Resistance...

297
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:44,954
and you'll be happy to know that you
are a very precious commodity to us.

298
00:19:45,067 --> 00:19:46,295
[Laughs]

299
00:19:47,659 --> 00:19:50,423
I am not a commodity.

300
00:19:51,115 --> 00:19:52,639
I'm a Viper pilot.

301
00:19:53,547 --> 00:19:55,845
You see any Vipers
around here?

302
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,808
[Gasping]

303
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:57,933
I mean, you do realize...

304
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:00,431
that you're one of a handful
of women left on this planet...

305
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:03,976
actually capable
of having children, right?

306
00:20:04,011 --> 00:20:06,697
I mean, that is your most
valuable skill right now.

307
00:20:06,732 --> 00:20:09,384
Well, I don't want a child,
so just drop it, okay?

308
00:20:10,059 --> 00:20:11,754
Well, no one's forcing you.

309
00:20:13,515 --> 00:20:16,143
Just take a moment
and think about...

310
00:20:16,939 --> 00:20:19,965
where you are
and what's going on.

311
00:20:20,779 --> 00:20:23,714
The human race
is on the verge of extinction.

312
00:20:24,619 --> 00:20:27,240
And, to be quite frank
with you, potential mothers...

313
00:20:27,275 --> 00:20:32,110
are a lot more valuable right now
than a whole squadron of Viper pilots.

314
00:20:34,635 --> 00:20:37,729
I shouldn't have mentioned it. I
should've known you'd be sensitive.

315
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:41,886
A lot of women with your history
forego bearing children of their own.

316
00:20:42,187 --> 00:20:43,654
My history?

317
00:20:44,267 --> 00:20:46,414
I saw the fractures
on your X-rays.

318
00:20:46,449 --> 00:20:48,562
A lot of old fractures
from childhood.

319
00:20:57,483 --> 00:21:02,079
It's interesting how you managed
to break every finger on both hands.

320
00:21:02,539 --> 00:21:07,374
Every break in the exact same place,
between the first and the second knuckle.

321
00:21:16,395 --> 00:21:18,386
Did someone
break your fingers, Kara?

322
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:22,797
Get out.

323
00:21:25,419 --> 00:21:27,410
Children
of abusive parents...

324
00:21:27,467 --> 00:21:31,096
often fear passing along that
abuse to their own children.

325
00:21:32,267 --> 00:21:33,928
Get out!

326
00:21:35,915 --> 00:21:37,109
All right.

327
00:21:43,979 --> 00:21:44,968
[Door opening]

328
00:21:45,131 --> 00:21:46,428
[Sobbing]

329
00:21:54,763 --> 00:21:55,923
[People chattering]

330
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:57,915
Is she kidding with this?

331
00:21:58,123 --> 00:22:01,581
I know it's hard to believe, but that
message has cropped up all over the fleet.

332
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,670
It's religious crap.

333
00:22:04,811 --> 00:22:08,770
"It seems I have been chosen to help
lead you to the promised land of Earth.

334
00:22:08,779 --> 00:22:10,472
"I will not question
this choice.

335
00:22:10,507 --> 00:22:12,873
"I will simply try
to play my part in the plan.

336
00:22:12,908 --> 00:22:15,004
"Therefore,
at the appointed hour...

337
00:22:15,531 --> 00:22:18,022
"I will give a signal
to the fleet.

338
00:22:18,283 --> 00:22:22,583
"All those wishing to honor the
gods and walk the path of destiny...

339
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:25,349
"will follow me back to Kobol.

00:22:25,418 --> 00:22:30,253
"It is there that we will meet the
gods' servant with the Arrow of Apollo."

341
00:22:36,683 --> 00:22:39,777
We've got five Raptors with
marine fire-teams standing by...

342
00:22:39,812 --> 00:22:41,588
<i>to board the Astral Queen.</i>

343
00:22:42,283 --> 00:22:44,410
No one's gonna follow her.

344
00:22:44,907 --> 00:22:47,137
No one's gonna believe
this crap.

345
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,909
No one's this stupid.

346
00:22:50,347 --> 00:22:55,114
And anyone that is, that wants
to make a suicide run to Kobol...

347
00:22:56,138 --> 00:22:57,867
please let them.

348
00:23:04,107 --> 00:23:06,007
(Roslin)
How long till we jump?

349
00:23:06,571 --> 00:23:07,799
Two minutes.

350
00:23:07,947 --> 00:23:10,472
Any other ships

this isn't necessary.

Oh, no. It's not right.

over this line 10 times already.

She must have taken a bullet. She
was right here by the vehicles.

363
00:24:26,429 --> 00:24:28,474
She would have got up and
crawled the frak out of here.

Hey, we have to search
the entire area again.

365

pulled back so fast.

Anders, we got ambushed, okay?

nothing we could have done about it.

understand. Let's just find her.
