1
00:00:19,847 --> 00:00:22,509
<i>(female narrator) Previously
on Battlestar Galactica.</i>

2
00:00:23,943 --> 00:00:25,205
(Gaeta)
Twenty-four ships jumped away.

3
00:00:25,223 --> 00:00:27,044
That's almost
a third of the fleet.

4
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:30,310
They're gonna follow Roslin
to Kobol to their death.

5
00:00:30,345 --> 00:00:31,874
[People shouting]

6
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:33,690
(woman)
Cally shot Sharon!

7
00:00:33,703 --> 00:00:37,195
(Adama) There are many
copies. You'll see her again.

8
00:00:37,223 --> 00:00:41,785
One of those things put two
rounds into my father's chest.

9
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:43,426
<i>(Roslin)
We have found Kobol.</i>

10
00:00:43,431 --> 00:00:47,265
<i>And when we retrieve the Arrow,
we will open the Tomb of Athena...</i>

11
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,439
and we will find
the road to Earth.

12
00:00:49,447 --> 00:00:51,172
What I need to know...

13
00:00:51,207 --> 00:00:54,301
is exactly how to find
the Tomb of Athena.

14
00:00:54,336 --> 00:00:55,680
I can show you the path.

15
00:00:55,687 --> 00:00:58,614
I don't know how long the path
is, or exactly where it leads to...

16
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:01,542
but I can tell you that you're gonna
have to move very, very quickly.

17
00:01:01,577 --> 00:01:02,467
[Explosion]

18
00:01:03,047 --> 00:01:04,036
[Crying]

19
00:01:04,423 --> 00:01:08,484
I want to see all recon material
on Kobol immediately in my quarters.

20
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:09,517
Kobol?

21
00:01:09,543 --> 00:01:11,636
I'm putting the fleet
back together.

22
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:14,084
I'm putting our family
back together again.

23
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:17,418
The scriptures say
some of us will die on Kobol.

24
00:01:17,895 --> 00:01:20,363
Like a certain Capt. Apollo?

25
00:02:19,783 --> 00:02:21,375
[Thunder rumbling]

26
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,535
(Adama)
She could be anywhere.

27
00:02:32,934 --> 00:02:36,631
If we only use information contained
within the book of Pythia...

28
00:02:36,711 --> 00:02:41,307
which makes sense, given the president's
identification with that particular gospel...

29
00:02:41,351 --> 00:02:45,845
then the Tomb of Athena is
most likely located somewhere...

30
00:02:46,343 --> 00:02:49,028
in the mountains to the west
of the City of the Gods.

31
00:02:49,063 --> 00:02:52,328
Let's assume she starts at the
most easily recognized landmark...

32
00:02:52,363 --> 00:02:54,197
which is the opera house.

33
00:02:54,631 --> 00:02:57,532
They'd be setting down somewhere
right here in this meadow...

34
00:02:57,863 --> 00:02:59,490
then heading west.

35
00:03:05,222 --> 00:03:08,953
(Apollo) Are you okay? Yes. I am.

36
00:03:09,031 --> 00:03:10,658
[Breathing heavily]

37
00:03:11,143 --> 00:03:13,304
We got to get out
of this ravine.

38
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:16,608
I don't want us to get caught
in a flash flood.

39
00:03:19,559 --> 00:03:21,988
<i>(Tyrol)
Raptor One went down...</i>

40
00:03:22,023 --> 00:03:24,617
right about here just
outside the ruins of the city.

41
00:03:24,652 --> 00:03:27,347
Now we never made it past,
say, here.

42
00:03:27,687 --> 00:03:30,281
But we visually scouted the
approaches out to the mountains.

43
00:03:34,311 --> 00:03:35,539
[Grunts]

44
00:03:38,695 --> 00:03:40,686
Thanks.
Any time.

45
00:03:42,535 --> 00:03:44,260
If this is all
she's got to go on...

46
00:03:44,295 --> 00:03:47,423
I don't know how the hell that woman
thinks she's gonna find this tomb.

47
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:50,131
Well, maybe she's seen it
in a vision.

48
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,178
[All chuckle]

49
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:53,982
I'm serious.

50
00:03:55,142 --> 00:03:57,042
She says she sees things.

51
00:03:57,766 --> 00:03:59,996
Images, prophecies, whatever.

52
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:05,443
The point is that she believes in them
and so do the people that are with her.

53
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:07,834
Sir, with all due respect,
that terrain is so rugged...

54
00:04:07,869 --> 00:04:10,191
I can't imagine navigating it
without a map or a guide.

55
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:16,971
Okay.

56
00:04:17,255 --> 00:04:20,713
King of the hill. Queen of
the hill, thank you very much.

57
00:04:20,748 --> 00:04:23,110
We should take shelter
until the storm passes.

58
00:04:23,145 --> 00:04:25,273
Sounds good. After that?

59
00:04:26,023 --> 00:04:27,923
Then we start the tough part.

60
00:04:32,007 --> 00:04:33,235
Let's go!

61
00:04:38,023 --> 00:04:41,117
The last rescue team reported
no sign of a Cylon baseship...

62
00:04:41,152 --> 00:04:42,758
or a raider anywhere
near Kobol.

63
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:46,320
We'll set the jump arrival
coordinates in the upper atmosphere...

64
00:04:46,355 --> 00:04:47,544
just in case.

65
00:04:47,559 --> 00:04:52,326
Sir, that's risky and it's certainly
not possible with a ship of this size.

66
00:04:52,742 --> 00:04:55,404
I'll be going down in a Raptor. What?

67
00:04:56,711 --> 00:04:59,332
I'm not gonna leave
the fleet undefended...

68
00:04:59,367 --> 00:05:01,953
and it's too risky
to try and take all of us.

69
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:04,185
Send a search party,
for frak's sake.

70
00:05:06,534 --> 00:05:09,970
"And Zeus warned the leaders
of the 12 tribes...

71
00:05:10,087 --> 00:05:13,579
"that any return to Kobol
would exact a price in blood."

72
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:15,501
(Tyrol)
It certainly did for us.

73
00:05:16,615 --> 00:05:19,914
No more bloodshed,
enough loss.

74
00:05:20,295 --> 00:05:22,889
I'm only gonna take people
who are absolutely necessary.

75
00:05:22,924 --> 00:05:24,788
Don't try and argue
with me, Saul.

76
00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:27,597
Truth is...

77
00:05:28,711 --> 00:05:31,544
I'm the only one
that can reach out to Roslin.

78
00:05:32,358 --> 00:05:34,499
It's always been
between us anyway.

79
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:38,129
We may have gone down separately,
but we're gonna come back together.

80
00:05:38,164 --> 00:05:39,710
Hopefully on our feet.

81
00:05:41,094 --> 00:05:44,154
But even in body bags we're
gonna be coming back together.

82
00:05:45,671 --> 00:05:47,396
<i>I'm gonna contact
the Astral Queen.</i>

83
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:49,412
See if they can pick us up
until the weather clears.

84
00:05:49,447 --> 00:05:52,075
You're not in charge here, Tom.
All com traffic goes through me.

85
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,563
Try to remember that.

86
00:05:57,414 --> 00:05:59,507
How much longer
do you want to wait, Tom?

87
00:06:01,543 --> 00:06:03,340
Just keep
your eyes on him.

88
00:06:51,303 --> 00:06:53,892
(Boomer)
11:00. 20 degrees elevation.

89
00:06:53,927 --> 00:06:56,418
There's a formation
of twin rocks up ahead.

90
00:06:56,453 --> 00:06:57,755
(Apollo)
Yeah, I got it.

91
00:06:57,767 --> 00:07:00,861
I think those are the
Gates of Hera. You think?

92
00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:05,881
I'm putting together a lot of pieces from
a lot of sources beyond your scriptures.

93
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,188
If I'm right...

94
00:07:07,206 --> 00:07:09,283
that's the spot where
your God supposedly stood...

95
00:07:09,318 --> 00:07:12,116
and watched Athena throw herself
down onto the rocks below...

96
00:07:12,151 --> 00:07:14,904
out of despair over the exodus
of the 13 tribes.

97
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:15,981
(Zarek)
Supposedly?

98
00:07:16,231 --> 00:07:17,955
I thought the Cylons
believed in the gods.

99
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,679
(Starbuck)
Yeah, don't get her started.

100
00:07:19,686 --> 00:07:22,484
They believe in one true God
or something like that.

101
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:24,291
And we don't worship
false idols.

102
00:07:24,326 --> 00:07:26,467
You were quick enough
to come on this mission.

103
00:07:26,502 --> 00:07:30,632
Lead us all to some tomb only actually
mentioned in our false scriptures.

104
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:33,059
We know more about
your religion than you do.

105
00:07:34,151 --> 00:07:36,016
Athena's Tomb, whoever...

106
00:07:36,454 --> 00:07:40,015
whatever she really was,
is probably up there.

107
00:07:40,967 --> 00:07:42,628
That part is true.

108
00:07:42,887 --> 00:07:45,754
Madam President, we won't make
it up there before nightfall.

109
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,993
Let's go, see how far we get.

110
00:07:53,255 --> 00:07:55,280
(Baltar)
This is a depressing place.

111
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:02,275
A part of me is glad
Sharon never made it in here.

112
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:12,216
You decided to brighten up
the place a little, did you?

113
00:08:12,871 --> 00:08:16,238
Our child will be born here.
In this room.

114
00:08:18,663 --> 00:08:20,961
You're not listening.
Oh, you noticed?

115
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,586
No, I have had enough.

116
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,982
Do you seriously expect me to listen
to you while you sit around stark naked?

117
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:30,885
Prattle on about this
mythical baby of ours?

118
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,551
Mythical?
Yes, mythical.

119
00:08:34,502 --> 00:08:37,699
Do you have any notion of
how ridiculous you've become?

120
00:08:37,734 --> 00:08:40,804
The whole turn of our conversation
is completely shot to pieces.

121
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:45,173
I'm the father of a baby who'll be
born to me from my fantasy woman...

122
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,585
who I see solely in my head.

123
00:08:46,599 --> 00:08:49,124
My fantasy woman, by the way,
who stopped being my fantasy.

124
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,980
You're not
my fantasy anymore.

125
00:08:51,015 --> 00:08:54,917
No, sadly now you're nothing
more than a common tease.

126
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:57,219
I never said
I would bear the child.

127
00:08:57,254 --> 00:09:01,714
Wonderful! More doubletalk.
More mind games.

128
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,727
All right, then
who is it gonna be?

129
00:09:04,006 --> 00:09:07,100
Who's going to bear
our secret love child?

130
00:09:07,135 --> 00:09:08,809
It's not Starbuck, is it?

131
00:09:09,703 --> 00:09:12,797
Careful, Gaius, you're
in dangerous territory now.

132
00:09:13,222 --> 00:09:15,190
Then I guess
I'm really scared.

133
00:09:15,303 --> 00:09:18,363
So, what's it going to be
this week? What is it?

134
00:09:18,406 --> 00:09:20,397
Don't tell me, I'll guess.

135
00:09:21,927 --> 00:09:23,622
The ship's gonna blow up!

136
00:09:23,657 --> 00:09:25,089
No, damn!

137
00:09:25,094 --> 00:09:28,291
Done that one.
So it's gotta be someone else.

138
00:09:28,326 --> 00:09:30,093
Someone... Me!

139
00:09:30,182 --> 00:09:32,995
But, of course, me!
I'm gonna explode! God!

140
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,488
God is gonna make me spontaneously
combust into a great big ball of flame...

141
00:09:36,523 --> 00:09:39,358
<i>and then the whole crew of
Galactica can celebrate on ambrosia.</i>

142
00:09:39,393 --> 00:09:40,964
Get really drunk.

143
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:42,761
[Laughing]

144
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:50,386
Okay. Enough,
I can't do this anymore.

145
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:54,242
You're right.
Game's over you win.

146
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:57,728
(Baltar)
I win?

147
00:10:01,447 --> 00:10:03,745
What did I win?
You don't get it?

148
00:10:05,383 --> 00:10:09,183
Come on, Gaius, wake up and
smell the psychosis already.

149
00:10:10,214 --> 00:10:12,512
I'm sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

150
00:10:12,547 --> 00:10:14,716
Okay. Look...

151
00:10:15,335 --> 00:10:18,463
there's no Cylon chip
implanted in your brain.

152
00:10:19,238 --> 00:10:20,466
I'm not real.

153
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:24,287
You're not really getting
secret messages from the Cylons.

154
00:10:25,447 --> 00:10:26,880
You're just crazy.

155
00:10:31,942 --> 00:10:33,000
[Chuckles]

156
00:10:33,031 --> 00:10:34,362
Very funny.

157
00:10:34,535 --> 00:10:37,129
Hysterical. Do you write
your own material?

158
00:10:37,382 --> 00:10:39,907
You don't believe me,
do you? No, I don't.

159
00:10:39,942 --> 00:10:41,345
[Laughing]

160
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:45,187
That's great! I love it.
Is it?

161
00:10:45,222 --> 00:10:46,746
Good. I've had enough
of this, all right?

162
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:48,386
So can we just stop playing
this stupid game?

163
00:10:48,391 --> 00:10:49,619
I'm sorry.

164
00:10:50,855 --> 00:10:53,449
But it's the truth.
There is no chip.

165
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:58,384
If there is no chip...

166
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,727
then who...

167
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,603
or what are you exactly?

168
00:11:05,286 --> 00:11:06,583
I'm you.

169
00:11:07,943 --> 00:11:10,741
I'm your subconscious
frakking with your mind.

170
00:11:13,095 --> 00:11:16,189
Okay, check it out.

171
00:11:17,606 --> 00:11:20,803
You helped the Cylons commit
genocide against your own people...

172
00:11:20,838 --> 00:11:23,870
and your fragile little mind
couldn't handle it. So, poof!

173
00:11:24,263 --> 00:11:27,096
I appear and start telling you
how special you are.

174
00:11:27,131 --> 00:11:30,880
How God has chosen you.
Yeah, right!

175
00:11:36,038 --> 00:11:38,734
Well, I don't know what game
you're playing anymore.

176
00:11:39,975 --> 00:11:43,775
But I'm not playing this stupid
game, Sara. Now you've had your fun.

177
00:11:44,007 --> 00:11:46,567
Why don't you get
yourself checked out?

178
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:50,728
Go down to sickbay and get a brain
scan. That would settle it, wouldn't it?

179
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,614
Go ahead. I dare you.

180
00:12:05,127 --> 00:12:06,617
(Tyrol)
How simple could it be?

181
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:10,327
Okay, we're in
the North-northwest continent.

182
00:12:10,662 --> 00:12:13,062
Quadrant C,
Sector two, which...

183
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:16,828
Oh, for frak's sake let me see if
I can make heads or tails of it.

184
00:12:16,863 --> 00:12:20,210
Look, I marked the terrain as
best I could, but we're not...

185
00:12:21,095 --> 00:12:23,325
Topography's
for pansies anyways.

186
00:12:23,654 --> 00:12:26,122
How're you feeling?
Diplomatic?

187
00:12:26,342 --> 00:12:28,984
I still don't think this is
a very good idea, Commander.

188
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:31,555
The last time she saw me
she wasn't too happy with me.

189
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:35,720
She trusts you. Values your
counsel. She'll listen to you.

190
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,347
I doubt that very much.

191
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:40,180
I'm her assistant. She doesn't put
any more stock than what I say...

192
00:12:40,215 --> 00:12:42,500
She thinks you'll be
president one day.

193
00:12:42,758 --> 00:12:44,692
[Aircraft engine revving]

194
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:47,536
Excuse me? That's what
she said to me once.

195
00:12:48,231 --> 00:12:52,691
That you reminded her of President
Adar when he ran for his first office.

196
00:12:55,846 --> 00:12:58,778
I don't really know
how to respond to that, sir.

197
00:12:58,813 --> 00:13:01,710
Don't let it go to your head.
Adar was a moron.

198
00:13:02,566 --> 00:13:04,295
(Racetrack)
This is an intra-atmos entry.

199
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,387
You guys buckled in?
Yeah.

200
00:13:19,334 --> 00:13:21,700
[Beeping] Perimeter's
clear! No Cylon presence!

201
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:24,639
See? Nothing to worry about.

202
00:13:25,478 --> 00:13:27,412
Having good luck already.

203
00:13:56,678 --> 00:14:01,547
Gives me the creeps seeing
him acting like that with her.

204
00:14:02,982 --> 00:14:07,214
He loves her. And, yeah,
he knows she's a machine.

205
00:14:07,815 --> 00:14:10,079
He doesn't care.
He loves her anyway.

206
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:15,119
Frak. How can one of us get
that roped in by one of them?

207
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,446
We should keep
an eye on him, too.

208
00:14:17,542 --> 00:14:21,103
Helo's a friend of mine, all
right. He's one of the good guys.

209
00:14:21,542 --> 00:14:22,668
Yeah?

210
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:25,035
Sharon was a friend
of yours, too.

211
00:14:31,878 --> 00:14:33,812
Feel like I'm back
on Caprica.

212
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:37,371
No, thanks.
I'm happy right here.

213
00:14:38,887 --> 00:14:39,979
Really?

214
00:14:41,063 --> 00:14:45,363
Yeah, actually. Just being with you
and Kara feels like I've come home.

215
00:14:45,702 --> 00:14:47,260
It's like I'm back
in the fleet.

216
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:50,535
But you were never in the
fleet. That was the other Sharon.

217
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,747
I know. I know that.

218
00:14:54,022 --> 00:14:55,785
But I remember all of it.

219
00:14:56,358 --> 00:14:59,987
<i>Like getting my wings. My
first trip aboard the Galactica.</i>

220
00:15:02,214 --> 00:15:06,878
You know, the memory of being in
a uniform is so strong, so potent...

221
00:15:06,913 --> 00:15:10,194
it's like, "I'm Sharon Valerii
and this is my family."

222
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:16,356
That's pretty weird, huh?
It's okay.

223
00:15:17,478 --> 00:15:18,672
I like weird.

224
00:15:21,606 --> 00:15:23,938
(Zarak) Losing that priest
really frakked her up.

225
00:15:24,934 --> 00:15:26,731
She's lost a lot of people.

226
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:29,214
Friends, supporters.

227
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,675
All she has left
is her young prince.

228
00:15:32,838 --> 00:15:35,773
We're here. He's here.

229
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,036
We know what we have to do.

230
00:15:39,334 --> 00:15:41,187
Terrain's rougher
than we thought.

231
00:15:41,222 --> 00:15:43,417
Don't know how far
until we reach this tomb.

232
00:15:43,452 --> 00:15:44,888
Why are you backing
out of this now?

233
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,460
I'm not backing
out of anything.

234
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,997
Getting blood on your hands is
a lot harder than washing it off.

235
00:15:50,438 --> 00:15:52,463
Then let the Cylon do it.

236
00:15:53,446 --> 00:15:56,813
What if the Cylon were to get
a weapon and shoot him herself?

237
00:15:57,414 --> 00:16:00,042
There'll be a lot
of confusion, stress, panic.

238
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,770
Then the Cylon could find
herself getting shot real easy.

239
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,999
And how would you propose
such a thing might happen?

240
00:16:08,678 --> 00:16:11,511
This has to happen, Tom.
You know that.

241
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:16,567
Not until we find the tomb.

242
00:16:33,542 --> 00:16:35,908
(Helo) How much further? Farther.

243
00:16:36,582 --> 00:16:37,640
What?

244
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:41,071
Farther describes actual distance,
further is more figurative.

245
00:16:42,022 --> 00:16:43,939
You're a dictionary now?

246
00:16:43,974 --> 00:16:45,737
I'm sorry
I'm smarter than you.

247
00:16:47,302 --> 00:16:51,102
That's okay. The baby can have your
brains as long as he gets my looks.

248
00:16:51,137 --> 00:16:53,949
Yeah, that'd be
a real blessing for her.

249
00:16:54,374 --> 00:16:55,568
Her?

250
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,140
You know it's a girl?

251
00:16:59,622 --> 00:17:00,782
Yeah.

252
00:17:03,238 --> 00:17:05,211
(Starbuck)
So from what I could tell...

253
00:17:05,246 --> 00:17:07,185
the Cylons have
a plan for Caprica.

254
00:17:07,814 --> 00:17:09,441
They're cleaning up
the bodies...

255
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:12,108
bringing in the heavy machinery
to fix the infrastructure.

256
00:17:12,143 --> 00:17:13,469
I understand.

257
00:17:13,862 --> 00:17:15,955
(Starbuck) But they
haven't killed everyone.

258
00:17:15,974 --> 00:17:17,908
There's a resistance movement.

259
00:17:18,214 --> 00:17:21,650
Once we find the tomb and get the map,
I think our first order of business...

260
00:17:21,685 --> 00:17:24,441
has to be planning a rescue
mission back to Caprica.

261
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:28,773
Lieutenant, I hope you know how grateful
I am for everything you've done...

262
00:17:28,808 --> 00:17:29,938
and what you risked...

263
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:33,325
but right now I can't think about
anything but finding that tomb.

264
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,516
Thank you.

265
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:47,595
Comfy?
Can't talk.

266
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:51,168
Can't move.
Then you...

267
00:17:51,494 --> 00:17:54,054
certainly wouldn't want me
to do this.

268
00:17:55,718 --> 00:17:58,380
Oh for...
I told you not to move.

269
00:17:59,206 --> 00:18:02,642
I'm so terribly sorry, Doctor.
It won't happen again.

270
00:18:03,238 --> 00:18:06,935
All right. Now I have to reset
and start from the beginning.

271
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:09,379
Now he's got to reset
and start all over again.

272
00:18:10,758 --> 00:18:12,123
[Sighing]

273
00:18:14,982 --> 00:18:16,279
Why are you doing this to me?

274
00:18:16,294 --> 00:18:18,194
(No. 6) Come on, Gaius, even
back when you weren't nuts...

275
00:18:18,229 --> 00:18:20,131
there was always that
little voice in your head.

276
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,828
That little voice helping you
through the rough times, remember?

277
00:18:24,806 --> 00:18:27,639
I'm just the latest version
of that little voice.

278
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:31,075
I don't believe that
for one moment.

279
00:18:31,782 --> 00:18:33,875
No, God has a plan for me.

280
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,261
God's plan?

281
00:18:35,334 --> 00:18:36,562
[No. 6 laughing]

282
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:39,907
Okay. Yeah,
God has a plan and...

283
00:18:39,942 --> 00:18:42,775
there is a God
and he talks to Gaius Baltar.

284
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:44,523
Okay.
Shut up will you!

285
00:18:49,062 --> 00:18:51,223
Will you stop going
crazy in there?

286
00:18:52,678 --> 00:18:54,077
I'm not crazy.

287
00:18:59,782 --> 00:19:02,945
Once you find this tomb, you know
he's gonna have you killed, right?

288
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,012
He's not like that.

289
00:19:04,038 --> 00:19:07,132
He's a soldier, you're the enemy.
Nothing's gonna change that.

290
00:19:07,167 --> 00:19:10,172
Your twin, your copy
or whatever... I know.

291
00:19:10,406 --> 00:19:12,185
The other Sharon
shot the old man.

292
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,965
I've heard it
about a thousand times.

293
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,857
Do you remember shooting him?

294
00:19:17,478 --> 00:19:18,775
It wasn't me.

295
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,315
Do you remember?
No.

296
00:19:22,982 --> 00:19:24,074
I see.

297
00:19:24,742 --> 00:19:27,575
What do you think happened
to her? I don't know.

298
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,858
Probably threw her
in the brig or something.

299
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:37,488
She was murdered
by one of the crew.

300
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,308
<i>And everyone aboard Galactica
just let it happen.</i>

301
00:19:41,926 --> 00:19:44,827
Think I'm lying? Ask Lee.

302
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:49,446
They're not gonna
let your child be born.

303
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:53,553
You think they're gonna let you raise
a potential enemy right in their midst?

304
00:19:55,014 --> 00:19:58,916
You want to get off this planet alive,
you better start looking out for yourself.

Put down your weapon, Captain.

Commander.

310
00:21:14,917 --> 00:21:16,908

Billy.

313
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:27,501
Billy, you have no idea...

314
00:21:28,005 --> 00:21:30,269
what it means to me
to have you here.

315
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,518
It's good to see you, too.

She's with us, Commander.

318
00:22:42,214 --> 00:22:43,579
Why?

Commander, no!

320
00:22:49,446 --> 00:22:50,879

Get off her.

321
00:22:51,589 --> 00:22:53,523
I want you to die.

322
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:02,515
Commander, please don't.
We need her.

323
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:05,121
Commander, you got
to let her go.

324
00:23:05,156 --> 00:23:06,083
Die.

Are you satisfied?

336

Yes, I am.
Thank you very much, Doctor.

You can obsess over these as
much as you like on your own time.

341
00:24:05,062 --> 00:24:08,691
Freaking hypochondriac.
One on every bloody ship.

342
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:15,709
You interfered with a military
mission and you broke your word to me.

343
00:24:16,869 --> 00:24:19,929
It's the second part that
really bothers you, isn't it?

344
00:24:20,742 --> 00:24:22,573
Laura, I forgive you.

345
00:24:25,957 --> 00:24:27,322
Thank you, Bill.

346
00:24:29,318 --> 00:24:31,616
I didn't ask
for your forgiveness.

347
00:24:33,893 --> 00:24:35,417
You have it anyway.

348
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:41,308
I can't believe the old man
reacted like that.

349
00:24:41,343 --> 00:24:43,583
You know they killed
the other Sharon?

350
00:24:44,709 --> 00:24:45,801
What?

351
00:24:46,373 --> 00:24:48,603
In cold blood,
not even a trial.

352
00:24:52,037 --> 00:24:53,061
(Tyrol)
Hi.

353
00:24:58,565 --> 00:24:59,623
Hi.

354
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,664
Sharon?

355
00:25:10,758 --> 00:25:12,020
Hello, Chief.

356
00:25:13,765 --> 00:25:15,426
You know who I am?

357
00:25:17,093 --> 00:25:18,185
Yes.

358
00:25:19,429 --> 00:25:21,226
We haven't met but...

359
00:25:22,022 --> 00:25:23,353
I remember you.

360
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:42,828
It's good to see you.

361
00:25:52,773 --> 00:25:54,673
<i>(Meier)
So where does this leave us?</i>

362
00:25:55,557 --> 00:25:57,286
Back to where we started.

363
00:25:57,542 --> 00:26:00,841
Under the yoke of President
Roslin and Commander Adama.

364
00:26:03,397 --> 00:26:06,274
Not if we go back to the ship
with a map to Earth.

365
00:26:06,309 --> 00:26:09,904
And a sad story of how many people
were killed down on Kobol by the Cylons.

366
00:26:09,939 --> 00:26:11,195
It's over.

367
00:26:12,133 --> 00:26:14,226
Let it go for now.

368
00:26:25,157 --> 00:26:29,423
Lieutenant Thrace says that there
are survivors back on the Colonies.

369
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:34,700
There are people fighting
against the Cylons every day.

370
00:26:34,735 --> 00:26:37,758
They're fighting for
their homes, their future.

371
00:26:38,405 --> 00:26:39,599
I see.

372
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,381
Doesn't give you pause?

373
00:26:43,397 --> 00:26:46,127
Maybe your impulse the day
the Cylons attacked was right.

374
00:26:46,162 --> 00:26:48,770
Maybe we should've stayed
and fought for our homes.

375
00:26:48,805 --> 00:26:52,263
Maybe the President of the Colonies
should've stayed with her people.

376
00:26:52,298 --> 00:26:54,028
I didn't come here for this.

377
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:57,277
I didn't come here
to navel-gaze...

378
00:26:57,312 --> 00:27:00,017
or to catalog our mistakes.

379
00:27:00,806 --> 00:27:04,708
We made a decision to leave
the Colonies after the attack.

380
00:27:05,573 --> 00:27:07,063
We made that decision.

381
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:11,063
It was the right one then,
it's the right one now.

382
00:27:13,061 --> 00:27:15,621
So every moment of every day
since then...

383
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:17,464
is a gift.

384
00:27:17,957 --> 00:27:20,425
From the gods?
No.

385
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:22,007
From you.

386
00:27:22,917 --> 00:27:26,182
For convincing me
that I should go.

387
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,880
I would be dead.

388
00:27:30,341 --> 00:27:31,968
My son would be dead.

389
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:35,981
Whatever else the costs...

390
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:38,561
I won't second-guess
that outcome.

391
00:27:46,565 --> 00:27:47,862
[Inaudible]

392
00:27:54,982 --> 00:27:57,416
Maybe it's time to go
find this...

393
00:27:58,181 --> 00:27:59,580
tomb of yours.

394
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:06,345
So Cally kills Sharon...

395
00:28:06,854 --> 00:28:09,687
and the old man gives her
30 days in the brig.

396
00:28:09,861 --> 00:28:11,453
Thirty days for murder.

397
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:13,312
They don't see it
as murder, Helo.

398
00:28:13,347 --> 00:28:15,035
That's what I'm trying
to tell you.

399
00:28:15,045 --> 00:28:16,898
That's what
you're not hearing.

400
00:28:16,933 --> 00:28:20,061
To him, to the president,
to all of them...

401
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:22,865
Cylons aren't people.

402
00:28:26,085 --> 00:28:27,814
I'm not a person to them...

403
00:28:28,422 --> 00:28:29,821
I'm a thing.

404
00:28:32,581 --> 00:28:36,483
I won't just stand by and let them
kill you like the other Sharon.

405
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:38,155
Okay?

406
00:28:40,581 --> 00:28:42,981
I believe you, Helo. I do.

407
00:28:53,157 --> 00:28:55,955
But if we're gonna have
any future together...

408
00:28:56,741 --> 00:28:58,231
any at all...

409
00:29:00,325 --> 00:29:03,226
I'm gonna have to take
matters into my own hands.

410
00:29:06,917 --> 00:29:08,885
What're you talking about?

411
00:29:10,245 --> 00:29:12,304
Do you love me?
Yes.

412
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,555
Do you trust me?

413
00:29:15,205 --> 00:29:16,399
Yes.

414
00:29:17,445 --> 00:29:19,704
Then don't ask me
what I have to do.

415
00:29:19,739 --> 00:29:21,964
Sharon, what the frak
are you...

416
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:24,212
Trust me.

417
00:29:25,157 --> 00:29:26,454
Trust us.

418
00:29:34,501 --> 00:29:36,731
Have you had a chance to
think about our conversation?

419
00:29:36,766 --> 00:29:38,904
Haven't thought about
anything else. And?

420
00:29:39,237 --> 00:29:41,467
When we get to the entrance,
they'll be distracted.

421
00:29:41,502 --> 00:29:43,811
I'll take the father
and you take the son.

422
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:45,673
You should see this!

423
00:30:25,541 --> 00:30:28,567
Lieutenant Thrace, I hope
you have that Arrow handy.

424
00:30:42,245 --> 00:30:43,906
I need you to know something.

425
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:46,722
I'm Sharon but I'm a different
Sharon. I know who I am.

426
00:30:46,757 --> 00:30:49,920
I don't have hidden protocols or
programs lying in wait to be activated.

427
00:30:49,955 --> 00:30:52,230
I make my own choices.
I make my own decisions...

428
00:30:52,265 --> 00:30:54,505
and I need you to know
that this is my choice.

429
00:31:13,285 --> 00:31:14,809
This is one
of the old stallions.

430
00:31:14,821 --> 00:31:17,119
It's not military issue. Where
the hell did you get this?

431
00:31:17,154 --> 00:31:18,321
It's his.

432
00:31:20,261 --> 00:31:21,489
[Gasps]

433
00:31:26,373 --> 00:31:27,601
[Groans]

434
00:31:28,901 --> 00:31:30,163
Take it easy.

435
00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:32,668
Just wanted...

436
00:31:33,254 --> 00:31:35,279
to see you get your due.

437
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:37,324
You never did listen to me.

438
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:38,306
[Gasps]

439
00:32:03,813 --> 00:32:06,976
Stupid frakking thing
couldn't come with a handbook.

440
00:32:07,462 --> 00:32:10,329
No, because that would just be
too logical, wouldn't it?

441
00:32:11,845 --> 00:32:15,750
"And the Arrow of Apollo
will open the Tomb of Athena."

442
00:32:15,785 --> 00:32:19,522
Yeah, well, unless anyone
sees a keyhole, or whatever...

443
00:32:19,557 --> 00:32:22,993
then we're either in the wrong place
or we're just perfectly screwed.

444
00:32:23,028 --> 00:32:25,579
Okay, then why don't we
just... Helo, come here.

445
00:32:32,421 --> 00:32:36,187
(Adama)
On three. One, two, three!

446
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:38,245
[All grunting]

447
00:32:38,277 --> 00:32:40,268
There it is.
Oh, my God.

448
00:32:41,253 --> 00:32:42,743
[Grunting]

449
00:32:52,613 --> 00:32:53,978
After you.

450
00:33:00,869 --> 00:33:02,962
Helo, you stay out.
Yes, sir.

451
00:33:02,997 --> 00:33:04,644
Chief? (Tyrol) Sir.

452
00:33:05,637 --> 00:33:08,697
Guard everybody. (Tyrol) Yes, sir.

453
00:33:16,101 --> 00:33:18,331
(Starbuck) If the Arrow didn't
actually open the tomb...

454
00:33:18,366 --> 00:33:20,300
how do we know
this is the right place?

455
00:33:20,335 --> 00:33:21,453
We don't.

456
00:33:22,309 --> 00:33:24,002
But it's a tomb
all right.

457
00:33:24,037 --> 00:33:26,956
The scriptures say you need
the Arrow to find the map.

458
00:33:26,991 --> 00:33:29,875
(Starbuck) These broken
statues, I recognize them.

459
00:33:30,789 --> 00:33:33,349
The ram, Aerilon.

460
00:33:33,733 --> 00:33:35,064
Gemenon, the twins.

461
00:33:35,077 --> 00:33:38,240
These are the icons of the
12 tribes, the 12 Colonies.

462
00:33:38,275 --> 00:33:40,775
This is really
where it all began.

463
00:33:41,637 --> 00:33:43,764
We all came from this place.

464
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,974
This could
be Picon, the fish.

465
00:33:46,117 --> 00:33:49,109
I guess, this little lady
could be Virgon, right?

466
00:33:50,693 --> 00:33:52,388
The goat, Caprica.

467
00:33:52,517 --> 00:33:53,950
(Roslin)
Sagittaron...

468
00:33:55,557 --> 00:33:56,956
the archer.

469
00:34:05,253 --> 00:34:06,982
He's missing something.

470
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:56,454
(Billy)
Where the hell are we?

471
00:34:56,489 --> 00:34:57,681
I don't know.

472
00:35:00,581 --> 00:35:02,640
Tomb of Athena, I think.

473
00:35:02,757 --> 00:35:05,055
I thought we were already
in the tomb.

474
00:35:05,285 --> 00:35:07,412
(Starbuck)
I think that was the lobby.

475
00:35:09,189 --> 00:35:11,248
Again the ancient symbols.

476
00:35:13,413 --> 00:35:15,074
These patterns...

477
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:18,530
were on the original flags
of the 12 Colonies...

478
00:35:18,565 --> 00:35:22,399
back in the days when the Colonies
were called by their ancient names:

479
00:35:23,397 --> 00:35:24,591
(Laura)
Aries.

480
00:35:28,261 --> 00:35:29,455
Taurus.

481
00:35:30,053 --> 00:35:31,247
Gemini.

482
00:35:31,973 --> 00:35:33,167
Cancer.

483
00:35:34,116 --> 00:35:35,208
Leo.

484
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:36,877
Libra.

485
00:35:37,381 --> 00:35:38,541
Virgo.

486
00:35:39,301 --> 00:35:41,861
(Adama) The jewels
match the constellations.

487
00:35:42,885 --> 00:35:44,443
(Apollo)
This is the map.

488
00:35:45,892 --> 00:35:47,621
This is the map to Earth.

489
00:35:48,037 --> 00:35:49,231
(Adama)
Maybe.

490
00:35:50,373 --> 00:35:53,809
So is Earth in one
of these constellations?

491
00:35:56,901 --> 00:35:58,664
We're standing on it.

492
00:36:01,061 --> 00:36:02,926
We're standing on Earth.

493
00:36:04,389 --> 00:36:06,380
The scriptures say...

494
00:36:06,501 --> 00:36:09,265
that when the 13th tribe
landed on Earth...

495
00:36:09,605 --> 00:36:12,938
they looked up into the heavens
and they saw their 12 brothers.

496
00:36:12,973 --> 00:36:14,496
(Roslin)
Earth is the place...

497
00:36:15,237 --> 00:36:17,467
where you can look up
in the sky...

498
00:36:18,437 --> 00:36:22,066
and see the constellations
of the 12 Colonies.

499
00:36:25,029 --> 00:36:27,725
I don't know what good
it's gonna do us though.

500
00:36:28,005 --> 00:36:29,973
Then what are we
supposed to do?

501
00:36:30,149 --> 00:36:34,279
Search the entire galaxy for
one particular star pattern?

502
00:36:36,645 --> 00:36:39,705
There. There in Scorpio.
I've seen that before.

503
00:36:41,669 --> 00:36:43,296
It's the Lagoon nebula.

504
00:36:44,133 --> 00:36:46,192
(Adama)
Astro body M8.

505
00:36:46,693 --> 00:36:48,593
That's a long way from here.

506
00:36:49,189 --> 00:36:50,315
Yeah.

507
00:36:51,397 --> 00:36:53,297
But at least now we have...

508
00:36:53,733 --> 00:36:55,633
a map and a direction.

that the scriptures...</i>

516
00:37:31,365 --> 00:37:33,196
<i>the letters from the gods...</i>

517
00:37:33,637 --> 00:37:36,231
<i>will lead us to salvation.</i>

518
00:37:38,212 --> 00:37:39,577
<i>Maybe they will.</i>

519
00:37:42,181 --> 00:37:45,617
<i>"But the gods shall lift those
who lift each other. "</i>

520
00:37:46,437 --> 00:37:49,497
<i>And so, to lift all of us...</i>

521
00:37:50,789 --> 00:37:52,848
<i>let me present once again...</i>

522
00:37:52,997 --> 00:37:56,330
<i>the President of the Colonies,
Laura Roslin.</i>

523
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,946
<i>Thank you.</i>

524
00:39:00,101 --> 00:39:01,500
[Knocking on door]

525
00:39:15,749 --> 00:39:16,875
<i>I'm okay.</i>

526
00:39:18,853 --> 00:39:20,445
<i>I'm okay, really.</i>

527
00:39:21,925 --> 00:39:23,017
<i>Yeah?</i>

528
00:39:31,781 --> 00:39:33,248
<i>It's just...</i>

529
00:39:35,365 --> 00:39:37,993
<i>I don't want our baby
born in this cell.</i>

530
00:39:44,517 --> 00:39:45,916
Their child?

531
00:39:46,213 --> 00:39:48,238
I told you a child
would arrive.

532
00:39:48,324 --> 00:39:51,157
Told you it would be born
right here in this room.

533
00:39:51,908 --> 00:39:54,001
How could you ever
doubt me?

534
00:39:56,677 --> 00:39:58,668
Boomer is going to bear...

535
00:39:59,973 --> 00:40:01,201
our child?

536
00:40:01,285 --> 00:40:03,378
An honor for which
she is hardly deserving...

537
00:40:03,413 --> 00:40:05,799
but one doesn't
question God's will.

538
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,110
Well, you're not a chip.

539
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,092
That we've established.

540
00:40:16,549 --> 00:40:17,607
Yes.

541
00:40:20,389 --> 00:40:22,050
(Baltar) Sharon being
pregnant does suggest...

542
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:25,989
that you are rather more than a simple
manifestation of my subconscious.

543
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,134
I'm not...

544
00:40:30,149 --> 00:40:32,014
Crazy?
No.

545
00:40:34,596 --> 00:40:35,961
And who...

546
00:40:37,605 --> 00:40:38,731
or what...

547
00:40:39,589 --> 00:40:40,749
are you...

548
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:42,451
exactly?

549
00:40:43,685 --> 00:40:46,279
I'm an angel of God
sent here to protect you.

550
00:40:46,565 --> 00:40:48,556
To guide you,
to love you.

551
00:40:50,597 --> 00:40:51,962
To what end?

552
00:40:53,573 --> 00:40:55,768
To the end of the human race.
