<i>(male narrator) Previously
on Battlestar Galactica.</i>

2
00:00:22,462 --> 00:00:24,799
Deep down in that thing
you call a subconscious...

3
00:00:24,834 --> 00:00:27,136
you know how many Cylons
there are left in the fleet.

4
00:00:27,171 --> 00:00:28,730
Eight! There are eight!

5
00:00:29,182 --> 00:00:31,377
Cpl. Venner reports the
former President's missing.

6
00:00:31,412 --> 00:00:32,985
Missing?
Two men down, cell's empty.

7
00:00:33,215 --> 00:00:34,273
Damn it.

8
00:00:37,087 --> 00:00:38,554
(Zarek) Glad to see
you, Madam President.

9
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,359
Well, Mr. Zarek. It would seem
the enemy of my enemy is my friend.

10
00:00:45,631 --> 00:00:46,893
Go find her.

11
00:00:51,006 --> 00:00:52,200
Let's go home.

12
00:00:53,502 --> 00:00:54,969
[Humming]

13
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,462
<i>(Roslin)
We have found Kobol.</i>

14
00:00:57,503 --> 00:01:01,132
<i>And when we retrieve the Arrow,
we will open the Tomb of Athena...</i>

15
00:01:01,167 --> 00:01:03,216
and we will find
the road to Earth.

16
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,769
No one's gonna believe
this crap.

17
00:01:05,855 --> 00:01:09,621
And anyone that wants to make a
suicide run to Kobol, let them.

18
00:01:11,518 --> 00:01:13,110
<i>Astral Queen has jumped away.</i>

19
00:01:14,143 --> 00:01:15,770
(Gaeta)
Twenty-four ships, sir.

20
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:18,824
That's almost
a third of the fleet.

21
00:01:19,262 --> 00:01:22,129
They're gonna follow Roslin
to Kobol to their death.

22
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:32,758
[Chattering]

23
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:36,443
(Dualla) 18,000 souls
aboard the 24 ships...

24
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:38,547
that joined former President
Roslin's rebellion, sir.

25
00:01:38,582 --> 00:01:40,617
(Tigh) That's over a third
of the people in the fleet.

26
00:01:40,652 --> 00:01:42,973
Give me a breakdown.
What have we lost?

27
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:48,035
<i>(Dualla) 9,500 souls from
Geminon, 6,250 from Caprica.</i>

28
00:01:48,254 --> 00:01:50,518
Not who. What.

29
00:01:51,038 --> 00:01:53,563
I'm not interested in people
who decide to join up...

30
00:01:53,598 --> 00:01:55,866
with a religious fanatic
and a terrorist.

31
00:01:56,127 --> 00:01:58,960
That's their business.
Now, what have I lost?

32
00:01:59,038 --> 00:02:01,529
[Sighs] Twelve transports,
seven freighters...

33
00:02:01,564 --> 00:02:03,060
three
construction platforms...

34
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,300
a private cruiser
and a mining ship, sir.

35
00:02:05,567 --> 00:02:07,000
<i>The Monarch was a blow.</i>

36
00:02:07,006 --> 00:02:10,271
We can't afford to lose mining
ships, not in our situation.

37
00:02:10,306 --> 00:02:12,454
And then
there's the collateral damage.

38
00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:14,555
Morale is down
throughout the fleet.

39
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,889
The press is going wild,
families are being split apart...

40
00:02:17,924 --> 00:02:20,154
Don't talk to me
about family.

41
00:02:21,535 --> 00:02:24,251
<i>(Apollo) I support the
president completely.</i>

42
00:02:24,286 --> 00:02:28,188
And my only priorities are the
preservation of her safety...

43
00:02:28,223 --> 00:02:29,721
and the completion
of this mission.

44
00:02:29,727 --> 00:02:32,787
That's all well and good, but he's
still Adama's son. (man #1) Yeah!

45
00:02:32,822 --> 00:02:34,133
(woman) Yes! When push comes to shove...

46
00:02:34,142 --> 00:02:35,835
how do we know
he'll be willing to stand up...

47
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,135
<i>If it were not for him, I would
still be in a Galactica jail cell.</i>

48
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:43,508
I trust him completely
and this subject is closed.

49
00:02:43,543 --> 00:02:44,823
<i>And what about Galactica?</i>

50
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,620
They know where we are.

51
00:02:46,655 --> 00:02:49,749
They could jump in here at any time
and charge us all with treason...

52
00:02:49,784 --> 00:02:51,685
or destroy this ship
with a flick of the wrist.

53
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,851
(Zarek) We're not entirely defenseless.

54
00:02:53,886 --> 00:02:56,081
[All muttering] Some
of our ships are armed.

55
00:02:56,255 --> 00:02:59,281
We should take steps to arm
the others, just in case.

56
00:02:59,518 --> 00:03:02,749
[All talking] Just in case
we want to commit suicide.

57
00:03:04,702 --> 00:03:08,468
<i>If Galactica wants to take us down,
there is nothing we can do about it.</i>

58
00:03:08,503 --> 00:03:09,441
Nothing.

59
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:13,463
And nobody in this room should be
under any illusions on that count.

60
00:03:14,687 --> 00:03:18,179
At this point, it's my firm belief
that Cdr. Adama has let us go.

61
00:03:18,214 --> 00:03:21,238
Lt. Thrace will return.

62
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:24,027
She will have
the Arrow of Apollo...

63
00:03:24,062 --> 00:03:27,015
and it will help us
find our way to Earth.

64
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:29,883
And exactly how long
should we wait for her?

65
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:32,284
I mean, maybe we should
go down to the surface now.

66
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,108
Go down now and start
looking for this tomb.

67
00:03:34,143 --> 00:03:36,771
I wouldn't be too eager. There
may still be Cylons present.

68
00:03:36,806 --> 00:03:39,225
And some of us
will die down there.

69
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:49,999
The scriptures tell us
that any return to Kobol...

70
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,159
carries with it a cost...

71
00:03:52,194 --> 00:03:53,318
in blood.

72
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:56,645
(Roslin)
People...

73
00:03:57,118 --> 00:03:59,183
I realize that
there are still many...

74
00:03:59,218 --> 00:04:01,249
[door creaking]
Unanswered questions here.

75
00:04:01,284 --> 00:04:02,713
But I refuse
to lose sight of what...

76
00:04:02,718 --> 00:04:04,276
[door slamming]
This has always been about:

77
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,948
Our mission to save humanity.

78
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,768
Yes, it's a big one.

79
00:04:09,663 --> 00:04:11,579
But it is our foretold
destiny...

80
00:04:11,614 --> 00:04:15,778
and I, for one, am not
going to waver from it now.

81
00:04:18,622 --> 00:04:20,315
(Roslin)
If there is anyone here...

82
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:23,062
who does not have the stomach
for this mission...

83
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:25,774
you are welcome to rejoin
Cdr. Adama's fleet.

84

[All chattering]

87
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:36,060
It jumped into dradis range
about two minutes ago.

88
00:04:36,095 --> 00:04:39,292
No Colonial transponder, and it's
too large to be Thrace's Cylon Raider.

89
00:04:39,327 --> 00:04:40,720
And no response to our hails?

90
00:04:40,734 --> 00:04:41,860
(Meier)
Not a peep, Tom.

91
00:04:41,886 --> 00:04:43,319
[Beeping]
It's either a Cylon vessel...

92
00:04:43,326 --> 00:04:45,148
<i>or it's a Raptor scout
from Galactica.</i>

93
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,515
Either way, we should shoot
first and ask questions later.

94
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,578
Okay.

95
00:04:49,214 --> 00:04:52,809
<i>The Adriatic is in weapons range
and she's got ship-to-ship missiles.</i>

96
00:04:54,046 --> 00:04:55,604
Tom, that thing
is moving fast. If we're...

97
00:04:55,614 --> 00:04:57,980
[door closes] Gonna shoot it
down, we better shoot it down.

98
00:04:58,015 --> 00:04:59,645
Shoot what down?

99
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,161
Do I have to repeat myself?

100
00:05:02,174 --> 00:05:04,608
Madam President, we have a
security situation, that's all.

101
00:05:04,643 --> 00:05:05,666
She wasn't talking to you.

102
00:05:05,694 --> 00:05:08,071
There's an unidentified ship
making its way towards us.

103
00:05:08,106 --> 00:05:10,395
(Zarek) It's too big to be
the Lieutenant's Cylon Raider.

104
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,888
<i>It's in weapons range. The Adriatic
has to fire her missiles now.</i>

105
00:05:14,495 --> 00:05:16,622
We need a decision,
Madam President.

Gentlemen, I'm only going
to say this once.

Capt. Adama, and...
What is your name?

Lt. Agathon. (Apollo) He
used to be Sharon's ECO.

You a Cylon, too?

Don't even...

131
00:07:53,694 --> 00:07:55,355
(Roslin) All right,
here's what we're gonna do.

132
00:07:55,358 --> 00:07:57,690
You're gonna lower your weapons.
Am I being perfectly clear?

133
00:07:57,725 --> 00:07:58,993
What about Sharon?

134
00:07:59,006 --> 00:08:02,373
She will be taken to a holding
cell, where she will remain unharmed.

Okay. How about it, Apollo?

She's the President
of the Colonies, you moron.

exactly what she says.

139
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,926

weren't gonna hurt her! No!

Please tell me he's alive.
Yes.

can speak?

172
00:09:46,036 --> 00:09:47,347
I can arrange that.

173
00:09:55,518 --> 00:09:57,509
It's great
to see you again, Kara.

174
00:09:57,949 --> 00:09:59,780
Thanks for bringing in
the trash.

175
00:10:04,894 --> 00:10:07,158
Looks like
we missed all the fun.

176
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:16,008
Perry?

177
00:10:16,286 --> 00:10:17,446
No.

178
00:10:18,782 --> 00:10:21,273
Well, Mueller. You know,
Mueller's not a bad choice.

179
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,034
(Tigh) He did a tour as a squadron X.O.

180
00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:26,279
[Cracking]
Mueller's a malcontent.

181
00:10:28,446 --> 00:10:29,913
I know
you don't want to hear this...

182
00:10:29,918 --> 00:10:32,443
but there is not another
Apollo in this bunch...

183
00:10:32,478 --> 00:10:34,506
and we do have to pick
a new CAG.

184
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:36,656
(Birch)
Cdr. Adama.

185
00:10:40,126 --> 00:10:42,011
Lt. Birch. Please, come in.

186
00:10:42,046 --> 00:10:44,173
Thank you for coming
in such short notice.

187
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,352
Of course, sir.

188
00:10:45,374 --> 00:10:48,104
I'm sure you're aware there's
been a change in the fleet.

189
00:10:48,446 --> 00:10:50,846
Several of our pilots
departed.

190
00:10:51,357 --> 00:10:54,258
I was just thinking that we
needed a new CAG to step up.

191
00:10:54,293 --> 00:10:55,764
Absolutely, sir.

192
00:10:56,382 --> 00:10:57,713
Who's it going to be?

193
00:11:03,966 --> 00:11:05,957
Congratulations, Captain.

194
00:11:07,966 --> 00:11:09,263
It's you.

195
00:11:09,694 --> 00:11:10,661
Thank you, sir.

196
00:11:10,686 --> 00:11:13,985
I just want you to know you have total
support of myself and this entire crew.

197
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,010
Is that not right, Colonel?

198
00:11:15,038 --> 00:11:16,062
Absolutely.

199
00:11:16,094 --> 00:11:18,528
Here's your log book.
Congratulations.

200
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:22,178
I'm honored, Commander.
I won't let you down.

201
00:11:22,654 --> 00:11:25,919
And sir, I'd just like to say that I
was a tremendous supporter of your son.

202
00:11:25,954 --> 00:11:28,652
Capt. Adama.
He was a great leader, sir.

203
00:11:31,486 --> 00:11:33,249
A ship is a family.

204
00:11:34,302 --> 00:11:37,931
It works on trust,
understanding, and love.

205
00:11:38,494 --> 00:11:41,827
I love everyone on this ship
as much as I love my...

206
00:11:45,214 --> 00:11:46,340
my sons.

207
00:11:49,565 --> 00:11:52,762
<i>Galactica is still a family. You're
an important part of that family.</i>

208
00:11:52,797 --> 00:11:53,861
Do you understand?

209
00:11:53,886 --> 00:11:55,080
Yes, sir.

210
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:59,240
Thank you, George.
I'm sure you'll do a fine job.

211
00:12:05,533 --> 00:12:08,502
What the hell? You got me in here
jawing about picking a new CAG...

212
00:12:08,537 --> 00:12:09,936
and you've already
made your choice?

213
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,578
I just wanted to see if you and
I were on the same page or not.

214
00:12:12,613 --> 00:12:13,702
I beg your pardon?

215
00:12:13,726 --> 00:12:14,715
I guess we're not.

216
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,810
You guessed right. You're telling
me that kid is leadership material?

217
00:12:17,845 --> 00:12:20,602
We have very few choices
and he's the best.

218
00:12:20,637 --> 00:12:23,970
He's a good man, Saul.
He's honest and he's loyal.

219
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:26,914
We need a little bit of that
around here right now.

220
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:27,902
[Cracking]

221
00:12:27,934 --> 00:12:30,129
Well, it's your call.
I'll support it.

222
00:12:37,406 --> 00:12:38,395
[Cracking]

223
00:12:41,822 --> 00:12:43,050
Commander.

224
00:12:43,069 --> 00:12:44,195
(all)
Cdr. Adama!

[Door closes]

227
00:12:46,878 --> 00:12:48,470
Can you tell us about...

228
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,635
Can you make any comments
regarding Laura Roslin...

229
00:12:56,638 --> 00:12:58,747
[hubbub continues]
Please be seated.

230
00:12:58,782 --> 00:13:00,795
This thing working?
Please be seated.

231
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:03,321
(lady reporter) Will you be
finally addressing those issues?

232
00:13:03,454 --> 00:13:04,921
[Microphone feeding back]

233
00:13:04,926 --> 00:13:06,917
(lady reporter) Commander,
will you be responding...

234
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,969
Allow me to make
a statement, please.

235
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:12,438
Please allow me to make a
statement. Please be seated.

236
00:13:12,702 --> 00:13:14,294
Thank you very much.

237
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:21,133
If you don't already know,
the fleet has been divided.

238
00:13:21,502 --> 00:13:22,935
[All chattering]

239
00:13:22,941 --> 00:13:24,272
(Adama)
Wait!

240
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,184
We share the grief
of friends lost.

241
00:13:30,525 --> 00:13:33,050
And the resources
we've sacrificed...

242
00:13:33,053 --> 00:13:35,419
will present
new challenges for all of us.

243
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,569
But if we stay together...

244
00:13:38,846 --> 00:13:42,907
we will rise to the occasion
as we have before.

245
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:50,894
[Reporters whispering]

246
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,774
Questions?

247
00:13:55,806 --> 00:13:56,864
(all)
Here!

248
00:13:57,182 --> 00:13:58,171
Yes?

249
00:13:58,526 --> 00:13:59,823
Do you know the coordinates...

250
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:02,204
the whereabouts of
President Roslin's rebellion?

251
00:14:02,205 --> 00:14:04,298
Do you intend to put
the fleet back together?

252
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:07,674
First of all, Laura Roslin
is no longer president.

253
00:14:08,413 --> 00:14:12,907
She relinquished that role when she
suborned mutiny aboard this ship.

254
00:14:12,942 --> 00:14:13,990
Next question.

255
00:14:14,014 --> 00:14:15,675
But, Commander...
Commander...

256
00:14:15,678 --> 00:14:16,770
Yes, go ahead.

257
00:14:16,797 --> 00:14:18,287
(man) Since the fleet
has been divided...

258
00:14:18,302 --> 00:14:20,668
Commander, you haven't
answered my question yet.

259
00:14:25,374 --> 00:14:28,605
We have lost no one that cannot
be replaced by someone loyal...

260
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:33,000
who has chosen
to remain with us.

261
00:14:33,662 --> 00:14:35,323
This is the fleet.

262
00:14:36,605 --> 00:14:37,731
Thank you.

263
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:41,045
This is the fleet? (male
reporter) Commander? Commander?

264
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,150
Is there any truth to the
rumor that there is no Earth...

265
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:47,351
it doesn't exist
and you just made it up?

266
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,466
What the hell
kind of question is that?

267
00:14:49,501 --> 00:14:53,028
It's been all over talk wireless,
newsletter circuit, hand mail.

268
00:14:53,277 --> 00:14:56,371
Freedom of the press
is not a license to slander.

269
00:14:56,638 --> 00:14:58,196
Broadcasting
that kind of garbage...

270
00:14:58,206 --> 00:15:00,367
is the quickest way to find
yourself in a holding cell.

271
00:15:00,402 --> 00:15:01,441
That goes for all of you.

272
00:15:01,469 --> 00:15:02,731
(Tigh)
We're done here.

273
00:15:02,941 --> 00:15:04,875
[All clamoring]

274
00:15:12,414 --> 00:15:13,813
Get your hands off me.

275
00:15:13,886 --> 00:15:15,854
[Door closes]
Why don't you calm down?

276
00:15:15,902 --> 00:15:17,883
Remind me
not to do that again.

277
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:20,386
Always looked easy enough
when Roslin did it.

278
00:15:26,685 --> 00:15:30,678
There was an old footbridge
over the Euclid River.

279
00:15:33,086 --> 00:15:36,522
I used to go there
when I was a boy.

280
00:15:38,686 --> 00:15:41,211
Watch the fish
try and swim upstream.

281
00:15:41,693 --> 00:15:43,354
They were mesmerizing.

282
00:15:44,925 --> 00:15:46,415
I envied them...

283
00:15:48,349 --> 00:15:50,647
unaware as they were
of the...

284
00:15:51,485 --> 00:15:54,420
wider complexities,
challenges of life.

285
00:15:54,942 --> 00:15:57,775
You're beginning to see
human beings as we see them.

286
00:15:57,949 --> 00:16:02,283
What I am beginning to see are
Cylon faces, everywhere I look.

287
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:10,610
Sharon told me there were
eight Cylons left in the fleet.

288
00:16:11,101 --> 00:16:13,001
Why didn't I ask her
who they were?

289
00:16:13,629 --> 00:16:15,187
If that idiot hadn't shot her.

290
00:16:15,197 --> 00:16:17,626
And why is it when things go
wrong, they go wrong so well...

291
00:16:17,661 --> 00:16:21,859
Gaius, you get yourself far, far
too worked up about these things.

292
00:16:22,686 --> 00:16:23,675
[Shushing]

293
00:16:25,341 --> 00:16:27,536
They do have it easy,
don't they?

294
00:16:29,118 --> 00:16:30,210
They?

295
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,921
Why are you talking to me
like I'm not one of them?

296
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,891
In some ways,
you never were.

297
00:16:37,406 --> 00:16:40,375
You have a path.
You will be spared their fate.

298
00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:45,381
For once, Gaius, you can stop manipulating
the world and let destiny take its course.

299
00:16:45,886 --> 00:16:49,117
If there's one thing we know about
human beings with certainty...

300
00:16:51,421 --> 00:16:54,015
they are masters
of self-destruction.

301
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:09,056
Because I love him.

302
00:17:09,118 --> 00:17:11,143
And because I'm carrying
his child.

303
00:17:11,389 --> 00:17:13,626
Oh, I see, that explains it.

304
00:17:13,661 --> 00:17:16,380
You're not here because
you mean us any harm...

305
00:17:16,415 --> 00:17:19,099
or because you're a
programmed enemy of humanity.

306
00:17:19,101 --> 00:17:23,231
You're here because you had an
affair with one of our Raptor pilots.

307
00:17:23,266 --> 00:17:25,051
Listen to me.
I'm listening to you.

308
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:27,884
That's my mistake.
I'm listening to a Cylon.

309
00:17:29,021 --> 00:17:31,387
I am here because I chose
to come here.

310
00:17:32,349 --> 00:17:34,010
And I know
you don't believe me.

311
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:37,613
But hear this,
even if you find the Tomb...

312
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:42,015
even if you find the map,
and even if you find Earth...

313
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:43,678
the price you pay
will be too high.

314
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:45,370
I'm not interested
in your prophecies.

315
00:17:45,373 --> 00:17:48,794
I know that there is a Cylon force
on Kobol. I know it's dangerous.

316
00:17:48,829 --> 00:17:52,215
And I have little doubt that you
are communicating everything I say...

317
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,990
even as we speak. It doesn't
work like that. I'm not wired in.

318
00:17:55,025 --> 00:17:57,562
Sharon, it's simple.

319
00:17:57,597 --> 00:18:01,226
What I need to know and
what might keep you alive...

320
00:18:01,726 --> 00:18:05,321
is exactly how to find
the Tomb of Athena.

321
00:18:06,205 --> 00:18:07,570
Get me a map...

322
00:18:07,582 --> 00:18:10,676
and I will do my best to tell
you how to get to the Tomb.

323
00:18:10,711 --> 00:18:12,411
No, you'll do better
than your best.

324
00:18:12,446 --> 00:18:15,779
I want to know where it is and
you either know or you don't.

325
00:18:18,685 --> 00:18:20,676
We all know about the Tomb.

326
00:18:21,053 --> 00:18:22,907
I can show you the path.

327
00:18:22,942 --> 00:18:25,687
I don't know how long the path
is, or exactly where it leads to...

328
00:18:25,722 --> 00:18:28,432
but I can tell you that you're gonna
have to move very, very quickly.

329
00:18:34,174 --> 00:18:36,802
She claims to love
Lt. Agathon.

330
00:18:37,181 --> 00:18:39,672
She says she loves the baby
she's carrying.

331
00:18:39,997 --> 00:18:42,227
Who cares what she says?

332
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:44,570
You can't believe a word,
any of them.

333
00:18:44,605 --> 00:18:46,698
The scrolls of Pythia
do speak of a lower demon...

334
00:18:46,733 --> 00:18:48,482
who helped the people
in a time of crisis.

335
00:18:48,517 --> 00:18:50,035
More superstition.

336
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:55,267
I've told her that unless we return
from Kobol with a map to Earth...

337
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:59,113
that Lt. Agathon will be put out
the airlock as a Cylon conspirator.

338
00:19:01,117 --> 00:19:02,584
Is that true?

339
00:19:02,622 --> 00:19:04,988
Doesn't matter if it's true.
She believed it.

340
00:19:06,141 --> 00:19:08,735
She saved them, both of them.
She didn't have to.

telling the truth about one thing...

she thinks she's in love.

344
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:20,885
Even if it's software instead
of an emotion, it's real to her.

352

about Kobol is because it's a Cylon trap?

353

I've done more than consider it. It is
clearly possible we're facing a trap.

354
00:20:13,758 --> 00:20:18,092
Capt. Apollo has already warned us that
Cylon encounter in the region is probable.

Has Capt. Apollo managed to tell
us anything we don't already know?

00:29:03,677 --> 00:29:06,914
Anyway, tomorrow this whole thing's
gonna end, one way or another.

510
00:29:06,949 --> 00:29:10,152
We find the Tomb or we don't. We
find a way to Earth or we don't.

511
00:29:10,525 --> 00:29:13,961
I just want you to know, Kara,
that I'm your friend. I love you.

512
00:29:13,981 --> 00:29:15,770
If there's anything
you want to talk about...

513
00:29:15,805 --> 00:29:19,707
anything you wanna get off your
chest, then I'm here for you.

514
00:29:27,581 --> 00:29:32,041
Anyway, whenever you wanna
talk just let me know.

515
00:29:33,693 --> 00:29:35,718
What was that
middle part again?

516
00:29:36,189 --> 00:29:37,679
What do you mean?

517
00:29:42,652 --> 00:29:44,449
Did you say you love me?

518
00:29:46,141 --> 00:29:48,666
Well...
Lee Adama loves me.

519
00:29:48,701 --> 00:29:51,932
No. All I meant was...
No, seriously, very sweet.

520
00:29:51,965 --> 00:29:53,398
You love me.

521
00:29:55,645 --> 00:29:57,203
No, you love me.

522
00:29:57,213 --> 00:29:59,511
You can't take it back.
There's no take-backs.

523
00:29:59,546 --> 00:30:01,112
You're dreaming it, Kara.
You love me.

524
00:30:01,117 --> 00:30:02,550
You're dreaming it.
You love me.

525
00:30:02,556 --> 00:30:03,921
Dreamer.
Mmm-hmm.

526
00:30:04,989 --> 00:30:06,183
Okay.

getting a visual on the fueling spar.</i>

529
00:30:10,717 --> 00:30:12,602

coming in way too hot.

530
00:30:12,637 --> 00:30:14,672

off your delta. You're too close!</i>

00:30:19,465 --> 00:30:20,378
<i>Are you listening?</i>

534
00:30:20,413 --> 00:30:21,812
<i>Okay. (Birch) We are not too close.</i>

535
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:24,312
<i>Abort. Abort the op.
Striker, remain on target.</i>

on a collision course.</i>

<i>No wireless contact, but it's in an axis
spin and there does appear to be some damage.</i>

551
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:11,602

tanker and restore navigational control.

the people of Kobol had a choice...

high road through the rocky ridge."

"in the Tomb of Athena."

00:31:59,868 --> 00:32:01,495
Yes. Precisely.

563
00:32:01,821 --> 00:32:05,757
And the great ship was a galleon that
departed from here, where we're standing.

564
00:32:07,293 --> 00:32:11,252
And it took the founders of the
13 colonies to their destiny.

It's interesting.

a powerful grip on the mind.

I'm talking about rage.

I can feel it,
right here...

598

Speak your mind, Dee.

I don't think the problem
is that you've been betrayed.

604

I think it's that
you feel helpless.

You were shot, you were injured,
you couldn't do anything.

Because every day
that we remain apart...

619

is a day that you've broken
your promise.

620

People aboard those ships
made their own decision.

621

It was their decision,
not mine.

00:38:13,628 --> 00:38:16,791
Thank you, Petty Officer.
You may leave now.

623
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,935
You asked to talk to me, sir.

624
00:38:27,197 --> 00:38:31,361
Maybe because you think that
I don't have anything to say.

625
00:38:33,276 --> 00:38:34,573
But I do.

626
00:38:44,892 --> 00:38:47,656
It's time to heal the wounds,
Commander.

627
00:38:49,212 --> 00:38:50,839
People have been divided.

628
00:38:50,845 --> 00:38:52,039

I want to see all recon material
on Kobol immediately in my quarters.

00:40:38,076 --> 00:40:39,270
Aye, sir.

638
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,689
Yes.

I'm putting the fleet
back together.
