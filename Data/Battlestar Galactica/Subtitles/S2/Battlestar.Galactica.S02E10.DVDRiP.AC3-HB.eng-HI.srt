APOLLO:
Gives me the creeps

3
00:00:24,115 --> 00:00:26,640
seeing him acting like that
with her...

4
00:00:26,675 --> 00:00:28,768
How can one of us get that
roped in by one of them?

5
00:00:29,171 --> 00:00:30,570
Look, Chief,

6
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:33,241
I know how she felt about you.
She loved you.

7
00:00:33,555 --> 00:00:35,889
You know what, I should
probably be grateful to you.

8
00:00:35,924 --> 00:00:38,223
Because that freak in her
belly could've been mine.

9
00:00:38,419 --> 00:00:39,909
<i>Do you have
actual memories</i>

10
00:00:39,923 --> 00:00:42,160
<i>of being with the Chief
before the Cylon attack?</i>

11
00:00:42,195 --> 00:00:45,892
You're the father of my child.
You're the first in my heart.

12
00:00:46,067 --> 00:00:47,830
<i>And nothing is ever
gonna change that.</i>

13
00:00:48,147 --> 00:00:49,840
All right, here's the deal.

14
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:52,343
We are gonna build
a new fighter.

15
00:00:53,267 --> 00:00:55,701

cleared for launch.

16
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:01,929
<i>Galactica, Apollo.
I've lost her.</i>

17
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:06,916
Of course, you lost contact. It's
a damn stealth ship, remember?

18
00:01:10,643 --> 00:01:12,688
The resistance base camp
is here.

19
00:01:12,723 --> 00:01:15,932
Three hundred clicks north of the
only Cylon airbase in the area.

20
00:01:15,967 --> 00:01:19,056
We can drop seven Raptors straight
down through the Martok Valley

21
00:01:19,091 --> 00:01:22,857
and be in and out before the Cylons
have a chance to launch their Raiders.

22
00:01:23,027 --> 00:01:24,551
<i>The Raptors return
the Galactica</i>

23
00:01:24,563 --> 00:01:27,123
with the resistance fighters,
we jump the hell out of there.

24
00:01:27,158 --> 00:01:28,149
Simple.

25
00:01:28,179 --> 00:01:29,646
Where's the Fleet?

26
00:01:29,651 --> 00:01:31,744
The Fleet will remain here.

27
00:01:31,987 --> 00:01:35,423
I've tasked seven Vipers and
one Raptor to stay with them.

28
00:01:35,443 --> 00:01:36,603
Seven Vipers?

29
00:01:36,626 --> 00:01:38,150
And one Raptor.

30
00:01:39,827 --> 00:01:40,816

31
00:01:42,003 --> 00:01:43,493

32
00:01:43,987 --> 00:01:47,286
<i>will it take Galactica
to reach Caprica?</i>

33
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:49,742
241.

34
00:01:50,995 --> 00:01:52,326
241?

35
00:01:52,339 --> 00:01:54,102
That's conservative.

36
00:01:54,579 --> 00:01:56,171
And you know it.

37
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:59,209
Once you jump the Red Line,

38
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,072
navigational error creeps into

39
00:02:01,107 --> 00:02:03,302
every single jump calculation
that you make.

40
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:06,169
It could take us
twice that amount of time

41
00:02:06,204 --> 00:02:08,447
to actually find Caprica,
let alone land.

42
00:02:10,707 --> 00:02:12,607
I understand the risks.

43
00:02:12,723 --> 00:02:13,849
ADAMA: Do you really?

44
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:15,433
We have to try.

45
00:02:15,634 --> 00:02:18,296
Lieutenant, I respect
what you're trying to do here.

46
00:02:18,331 --> 00:02:19,283
However...

47
00:02:19,315 --> 00:02:21,909
We have a duty
to the people we left behind.

48
00:02:21,944 --> 00:02:22,899
I understand that.

49
00:02:22,995 --> 00:02:25,759
We have to find a way to jump
back to Caprica and go get the...

50
00:02:25,794 --> 00:02:26,807
Kara.

51
00:02:27,827 --> 00:02:28,851

59
00:02:44,947 --> 00:02:47,006

Please.
How did you find us?

165
00:11:26,003 --> 00:11:28,752
Well, we were tracking
a Cylon fleet.

166
00:11:28,787 --> 00:11:30,414
We were trying to predict
their movements,

167
00:11:30,418 --> 00:11:32,592
which seemed
rather random initially.

168
00:11:32,627 --> 00:11:36,393
Until we realized that they were just
jumping to systems with natural resources.

169
00:11:36,428 --> 00:11:39,606
So, we began to scout
those systems ourselves,

170
00:11:40,082 --> 00:11:43,210
hoping to carry out hit-and-run
attacks on their fleet.

171
00:11:44,786 --> 00:11:48,244
But instead of finding
the Cylons, we found you.

172
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:50,612
So, you've been
attacking their fleet?

173
00:11:50,834 --> 00:11:53,928
Well, you know what they say
about the best defense.

174
00:11:54,994 --> 00:11:55,983
Hmm.

175
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:59,076
How did you avoid the initial
Cylon attack on the Colonies?

176
00:12:00,915 --> 00:12:02,712
I'll have another
if you don't mind.

179
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,855
Beats the hell out of the
nickel tour. Thank you.

180
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:18,654
I figured if you'd seen one old
Battlestar, you'd seen them all.

181
00:12:18,689 --> 00:12:20,738
Yeah, well,
she's an old one.

182
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:23,379
I can't believe the Cylons
didn't kick your ass

183
00:12:23,414 --> 00:12:25,749
up one side and down
the other in this bucket.

184
00:12:28,754 --> 00:12:29,914
Sorry.

185
00:12:30,962 --> 00:12:34,329
I'm sorry. No one gets to
insult your ship except you.

186
00:12:34,738 --> 00:12:36,729
You're Gods damn right.

187
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:41,710
And just for that

188
00:12:45,106 --> 00:12:46,869
you have to skip this round.

189
00:12:48,115 --> 00:12:49,446
(LAUGHING)

190
00:12:52,754 --> 00:12:55,985
We were docking
at Scorpion Fleet Shipyard.

191
00:12:56,882 --> 00:13:00,431
We were getting ready to go in
for a three-month overhaul.

192
00:13:00,466 --> 00:13:04,994
Most of the crew was getting ready for
extended shore leave and family reunions.

193
00:13:05,266 --> 00:13:06,460
XO had the deck.

194
00:13:06,482 --> 00:13:09,697
I was down in my quarters,
wrapping up some paperwork

195
00:13:09,732 --> 00:13:12,913
and getting ready to pack up
to go home to Tauron.

196
00:13:15,603 --> 00:13:17,711
And that's when
the Cylons attacked.

197
00:13:17,746 --> 00:13:22,012
They hit the shipyard
with three, maybe four nukes.

198
00:13:23,058 --> 00:13:26,152
Five ships.
Two of them Battlestars.

199
00:13:27,475 --> 00:13:29,773
They were destroyed
right there.

200
00:13:30,642 --> 00:13:33,304
And luckily,
very luckily,

201
00:13:34,834 --> 00:13:38,827
the blast blinded
the Cylon dradis.

202
00:13:39,314 --> 00:13:42,249
So they were unable to determine
that we were still intact.

203
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:45,207
But there were...
There were explosions,

204
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:47,297
and fires
in the launch bays,

205
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:50,688
and fuel and ordnance
igniting,

206
00:13:51,602 --> 00:13:53,229
people screaming.

207
00:13:57,394 --> 00:14:00,090
And by the time
I got back to CIC,

208
00:14:00,754 --> 00:14:03,655
I discovered that
I'd lost over 700 men.

209
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,340
My Gods.

210
00:14:07,826 --> 00:14:11,091
We were completely defenseless,
so I ordered a jump.

211
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:13,632
To where?

212
00:14:14,002 --> 00:14:15,299
Wherever.

213
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:18,211
Nowhere. Just jump.

214
00:14:20,275 --> 00:14:21,640
ADAMA: Blind jump.

215
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:25,468
Could've ended up anywhere.
Gutsy call.

216
00:14:25,554 --> 00:14:27,784
No. Desperate move.

217
00:14:28,978 --> 00:14:30,863
Didn't see any other choice.

218
00:14:30,898 --> 00:14:34,629
How'd you avoid the Cylons
infiltrating your computer system?

219
00:14:36,882 --> 00:14:40,841
Well, our networks were off-line
in preparation for the overhaul.

220
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:46,573
<i>Yes, Pegasus has always been
a rather lucky ship.</i>

221
00:14:46,578 --> 00:14:48,102
To lucky ships.

222
00:14:55,699 --> 00:14:57,462
I'm sure you have

223
00:14:58,642 --> 00:15:00,431
quite a story
to tell as well.

224
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,696
But I won't make you go through
it right this very minute.

225
00:15:03,314 --> 00:15:07,341
You can send up your logs
when you get the chance.

226
00:15:07,986 --> 00:15:09,248
Yes, sir.

227
00:15:14,162 --> 00:15:15,754
CAIN: Is something wrong?

228
00:15:17,106 --> 00:15:18,164
No.

229
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:22,429
I sometimes forget about the
rules of military protocol.

230
00:15:24,082 --> 00:15:26,799
ADAMA: Admiral Cain
is my superior officer.

231
00:15:26,834 --> 00:15:30,099
She will take complete command
of the entire Fleet.

232
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,660
I was wondering
how to broach that topic.

233
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:35,975
Trust me when I say

234
00:15:35,986 --> 00:15:38,955
that while the chain of command
is strict, it is not heartless.

235
00:15:39,634 --> 00:15:41,261
And neither am I.

236
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:43,665
This is your ship.

237
00:15:43,762 --> 00:15:47,960
<i>And I have no desire to interfere
with Galactica's internal affairs.</i>

238
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,361
I appreciate it, Admiral.

239
00:15:53,042 --> 00:15:55,476
Madam President, you look
like I just shot your dog.

240
00:15:55,511 --> 00:15:56,807
No, I just...

241
00:15:56,818 --> 00:15:59,616
Just the Commander and I,
we've been through a lot.

242
00:16:00,114 --> 00:16:02,480
Excuse me.
Madam President?

243
00:16:07,826 --> 00:16:09,919
If you'll both
excuse me.

244
00:16:11,602 --> 00:16:14,969
Admiral, I can't tell you how
grateful we are to have you here.

245
00:16:16,114 --> 00:16:17,911
Thank you for finding us.

246
00:16:21,042 --> 00:16:22,634
Madam President.

247
00:16:29,554 --> 00:16:31,749
The Secretary
of Education?

248
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:36,795
She's come a long way.

249
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:40,992
I'm sure.

250
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,188
So tell me
about Admiral Cain.

251
00:16:45,362 --> 00:16:47,125
Officer's discretion.

252
00:16:47,634 --> 00:16:48,965
Of course.

253
00:16:49,234 --> 00:16:53,830
We were going after what we thought
was a little Cylon comm relay.

254
00:16:54,994 --> 00:16:56,962
Easy target, right?

255
00:16:57,298 --> 00:17:00,665
Turns out it wasn't a comm relay
at all. It was a staging area

256
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,028
full of 15 squadrons
of Raiders.

257

(EXCLAIMS)

258
00:17:04,978 --> 00:17:08,243
Admiral Cain ordered
our XO to attack.

259
00:17:09,522 --> 00:17:10,955
Those two were real close.

260
00:17:10,962 --> 00:17:12,862
He'd served with her
for years.

261
00:17:13,522 --> 00:17:15,786
But here's the thing.

262
00:17:19,154 --> 00:17:21,019
He refused the order.

263
00:17:21,426 --> 00:17:22,688
No frakking way.

264
00:17:23,154 --> 00:17:24,815
There's one other matter.

265
00:17:26,738 --> 00:17:29,935
We have a Cylon prisoner
aboard this ship.

266
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:31,100
Really?

267
00:17:32,754 --> 00:17:34,688
We have one
on ours as well.

268
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:38,399
Ours has proven to be an
excellent source of intelligence.

269
00:17:39,922 --> 00:17:41,981
She's been very cooperative.

270
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:45,827
The Vice President, Dr. Baltar,
has been working with her.

271
00:17:46,354 --> 00:17:48,549
You're very lucky
to have him onboard.

272
00:17:48,946 --> 00:17:50,311
Very lucky.

00:17:50,834 --> 00:17:52,461
TIGH:
What did she do?

274
00:17:52,466 --> 00:17:54,297
She asked for his gun.

275
00:17:54,418 --> 00:17:57,717
Shot him in the head with it
in front of the whole crew.

276
00:18:00,242 --> 00:18:02,267
And then she turned to me.

277
00:18:04,402 --> 00:18:05,994
What did you do?

278
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:11,107
Then I ordered the frakking
attack, what do you think I did?

280
00:18:15,474 --> 00:18:16,463
No.

281
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:21,915
No, no. I'm just joking.

282
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:24,133
I'm just kidding, you know.

283
00:18:24,658 --> 00:18:25,647
Huh?

284
00:18:28,786 --> 00:18:29,980
No, no.

285
00:18:30,546 --> 00:18:31,535
Hey.

286
00:18:32,274 --> 00:18:34,037
Set us up again,
will you?

287
00:18:36,498 --> 00:18:39,279
We haven't been able to get
anything useful out of our Cylon.

288
00:18:39,314 --> 00:18:42,044
I'd like to set up an appointment
with Dr. Baltar as soon as possible.

289
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,264
Yes, sir.

290
00:18:44,882 --> 00:18:48,147
It gives me no pleasure
to have to take command, Bill.

291
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,157
I want you to know that.

292
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:52,892
Don't give it
a moment's thought, Admiral.

You guys put scorecards
on the side of your ships?

297
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:31,497
Like you don't keep score.

You don't see me
painting them on the side

299
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,423
like I'm bragging to the
whole frakking universe.

00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,503
That's 48 kills
right there.

301
00:19:37,841 --> 00:19:41,174
That's special. Do you
have caps and T-shirts, too?

Right here.

Let's hear the rundown on this
squadron of yours, Captain.

306
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:06,463
I see you don't keep track of
your kills. You should start.

<i>Encourages morale, gets the

Well, that's one philosophy.

00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,738
It's Admiral Cain's
philosophy.

310
00:20:15,762 --> 00:20:18,094
That means it's your
philosophy now, Captain.

311
00:20:19,058 --> 00:20:20,943
The name of my commander
is Adama.

312
00:20:20,978 --> 00:20:23,469
It should be pretty easy to
remember, 'cause it's my name.

313
00:20:23,762 --> 00:20:24,854
Yeah.

314
00:20:25,874 --> 00:20:28,399
I'll keep that in mind,
daddy's boy.

315
00:20:30,002 --> 00:20:31,799
Let's see
your ordnance lists.

I can never get over
how human they look.

317
00:20:54,834 --> 00:20:56,426
Yes. It's uncanny, isn't it?

318
00:20:57,873 --> 00:21:00,341
This model has been
very useful, in fact.

319
00:21:00,376 --> 00:21:01,999
It's given us
key insights into

320
00:21:02,034 --> 00:21:05,328
Cylon information systems,
tactics, strategic plans.

321
00:21:05,363 --> 00:21:08,623
I take it we've encountered
another Colonial warship.

322

You've gotten all of this
intel without coercion?

I find the application

325
00:21:18,641 --> 00:21:21,439
of physical or coercive techniques
to be counter-productive.

326
00:21:21,521 --> 00:21:22,988
You're going to ignore me.

327
00:21:22,993 --> 00:21:24,858
Pretend I can't speak.

328
00:21:26,673 --> 00:21:31,110
We treat this model as if it's
the human being it pretends to be.

329
00:21:31,633 --> 00:21:34,227
That seems to make it
more cooperative.

330
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:54,095
BALTAR: I haven't shown
you the lab, have I?

331
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:56,394
So with the background in
physics, and computer programming,

332
00:21:56,429 --> 00:21:58,360
they made me head
of the Cylon branch

333
00:21:58,395 --> 00:22:00,291
and my main focus
is on Cylon detection.

334
00:22:00,326 --> 00:22:02,255
We have our own
Cylon prisoner.

335
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:04,224
I'd like you to examine it
as soon as possible.

336
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:06,095
See if you can
glean anything from it.

337
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:08,291
I wonder who the Cylon
will turn out to be?

338
00:22:08,326 --> 00:22:10,572
A stranger,
a familiar face,

339
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:13,647
a trusted friend who suddenly
turns out to be the enemy?

340
00:22:13,682 --> 00:22:15,244
Did you hear
what I just said?

341
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,615
Yes, yes.

342
00:22:16,818 --> 00:22:20,276
I'd be really... I'd be very
happy to examine the prisoner.

Perhaps
you'll have better luck.

00:22:31,002 --> 00:22:32,925
She's a hard case,
isn't she?

348
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,403
Just your type, Gaius.

349
00:22:34,418 --> 00:22:36,886
You do have a thing for
strong, powerful women.

00:22:36,978 --> 00:22:38,309
Yes, I do.

351
00:22:38,994 --> 00:22:41,827
I'll do my best, sir.

352
00:22:52,146 --> 00:22:54,171
Sounds like
you were both drunk.

353
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,356
TIGH: No question.

354
00:22:55,378 --> 00:22:58,040
But he wasn't lying.
I can tell you that right now.

355
00:22:58,075 --> 00:22:59,936
Well, I hope you won't
jump to conclusions.

356
00:22:59,971 --> 00:23:01,412
Wait for all the facts.

357
00:23:02,129 --> 00:23:03,790
Context matters.

358
00:23:05,522 --> 00:23:06,921
Context?

359
00:23:08,497 --> 00:23:11,955
That woman shot an officer
right in front of the crew.

360
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,049
We shot down
an entire civilian transport

361
00:23:15,378 --> 00:23:17,812
with over a thousand people
onboard.

362
00:23:18,354 --> 00:23:19,651
Says so right there.

363
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:21,394
That was
completely different.

364
00:23:21,554 --> 00:23:23,818
And we don't know there were
people on that ship.

365
00:23:23,853 --> 00:23:25,283
Which is why I hope

366
00:23:25,298 --> 00:23:27,493
the Admiral reads
the complete log

367
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:29,474
and understands the context.

368
00:23:30,161 --> 00:23:32,857
We should ask Admiral Cain
for her logs.

369
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:34,810
Just so we can
put her in context.

370
00:23:34,845 --> 00:23:35,860
(CHUCKLES)

371
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,755
Wouldn't that be nice.

372
00:23:38,609 --> 00:23:40,839
TYROL: Cally, get a wrench.

373
00:23:42,353 --> 00:23:43,547
Thanks.

374
00:23:43,986 --> 00:23:46,614
Chief. Chief,
take a look at this.

375
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:54,925
Are these spare parts?

376
00:23:56,402 --> 00:23:59,735
<i>"For our fellow knuckledraggers
on the Galactica.</i>

377
00:24:00,146 --> 00:24:02,341
<i>"Courtesy of
the Pegasus Deck Gang."</i>

378
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,672
Cally, I'm starting to like
that ship.

379
00:24:09,841 --> 00:24:10,830
Lieutenant.

380
00:24:12,561 --> 00:24:13,858
Lieutenant Ferelli.

381
00:24:13,873 --> 00:24:16,270
These are navigational
updates,

382
00:24:16,305 --> 00:24:19,001
software patches
and systems upgrades.

383
00:24:19,537 --> 00:24:23,405
<i>And this is the complete
Pegasus on-board digital library.</i>

384
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,111
Everything from
the Articles of Colonization

385
00:24:26,146 --> 00:24:28,034
to Zarek's trial record.

386
00:24:28,465 --> 00:24:31,901
You did have to erase your
computer memory drives, correct?

387
00:24:33,106 --> 00:24:34,539
Yes, we did.

388
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:35,919
Thank you.

389
00:24:35,953 --> 00:24:37,215
Thank Admiral Cain.

390
00:24:38,354 --> 00:24:39,685
Got any porn in there?

391
00:24:40,049 --> 00:24:42,542
I've got ships
on half-rations,

392
00:24:42,577 --> 00:24:45,231
and others experiencing
mechanical difficulties.

393
00:24:45,266 --> 00:24:49,396
<i>And so far Galactica is the only
vessel having any of its needs met.</i>

394
00:24:49,553 --> 00:24:53,546
<i>Pegasus has been resupplying
Galactica from it's own reserve</i>

395
00:24:53,581 --> 00:24:54,584
for military operations.

396
00:24:54,609 --> 00:24:55,974
Which I
completely support.

397
00:24:55,986 --> 00:24:59,149
But when will some of these supplies
start getting out to the Fleet?

398
00:25:00,561 --> 00:25:02,511
Admiral Cain
has assured me

399
00:25:02,546 --> 00:25:04,751
that those supplies
are on their way.

400
00:25:04,786 --> 00:25:07,380
Well, at least she's taking
your phone calls.

401
00:25:07,415 --> 00:25:09,280
I can't even get her
to answer mine.

402
00:25:10,194 --> 00:25:11,991
I'll bring it
to her attention.

403
00:25:15,217 --> 00:25:17,151
How are you doing
with all this?

404
00:25:17,618 --> 00:25:19,210
She outranks me.

405
00:25:19,378 --> 00:25:21,243
It's as simple as that.

406
00:25:22,737 --> 00:25:26,138
You know, if President Adar stepped
off that Raptor, I'd be elated.

407
00:25:26,577 --> 00:25:29,671
Grateful to have someone
take over. And yet...

408
00:25:30,865 --> 00:25:33,561
I don't want to go
to the "and yet" part.

409
00:25:35,377 --> 00:25:37,709
I've been taking orders
my entire career.

410
00:25:38,226 --> 00:25:40,023
This is no different.

411
00:25:41,329 --> 00:25:43,627
Well, then, Commander,
thank you.

412
00:25:44,561 --> 00:25:47,291
We would appreciate
all the help you can give us.

413
00:25:47,761 --> 00:25:48,989
You shall receive it.

414
00:26:00,177 --> 00:26:03,943
Twenty-five
opto-electronic transducers.

415
00:26:04,785 --> 00:26:06,650
That's one ugly baby.

416
00:26:07,026 --> 00:26:08,220
Excuse me?

417
00:26:08,625 --> 00:26:10,559
Do you mind if I take
a look around? I'm...

418
00:26:10,594 --> 00:26:12,740
<i>I'm Laird,
Pegasus Deck Chief.</i>

419
00:26:13,329 --> 00:26:15,160
Oh, hey.
Yeah. Tyrol.

420
00:26:15,505 --> 00:26:17,612
Thanks for sending over
these parts.

421
00:26:17,647 --> 00:26:19,720
Yeah, look at
whatever you like.

422
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:21,874
Specialist Cally.
Hi.

423
00:26:23,729 --> 00:26:26,926
DDG-62's. I'll be...

424
00:26:27,858 --> 00:26:31,487
I designed these engines. I thought
they phased them out over 10 years ago.

425
00:26:32,113 --> 00:26:34,104
You're
an aeronautical engineer?

426
00:26:34,139 --> 00:26:35,530
Yeah, I was.

427
00:26:35,857 --> 00:26:39,122
<i>Then the war happened, and I got drafted
to being the Deck Chief on Pegasus.</i>

428
00:26:39,157 --> 00:26:42,516
So you're really a civilian?
How'd that happen?

429
00:26:42,833 --> 00:26:46,360
<i>I was on the Scylla, and we
got picked up by the Pegasus.</i>

430
00:26:46,395 --> 00:26:47,621
Things happen.

431
00:26:50,065 --> 00:26:53,091
Mind if I crawl around inside here?
I heard you designed this yourself.

432
00:26:53,126 --> 00:26:54,736
I'd love to see
how you did it.

433
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,070
Sure, yeah.
You'll get dirty.

434
00:27:01,617 --> 00:27:03,676
People come
to see my ship.

435
00:27:22,737 --> 00:27:25,865
Don't get too close.
It killed seven of my crew.

436
00:27:25,937 --> 00:27:28,303
You want my guards
to come in with you?

437
00:27:28,338 --> 00:27:30,139
Feeling scared, Gaius?

438
00:27:30,481 --> 00:27:34,076
Want the big, bad soldiers to protect
you from the mean old Cylon prisoner?

439
00:27:36,753 --> 00:27:39,483
No, I think we'll be
just fine. Thank you.

440
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:07,495
Oh, my God.

441
00:28:31,538 --> 00:28:32,937
NO. 6:
My God, Gaius.

442
00:28:34,225 --> 00:28:35,453
It's me.

443
00:28:50,801 --> 00:28:52,996
Look what
they've done to her.

444
00:28:54,289 --> 00:28:57,190
Open the door.
Now, please.

445
00:29:02,193 --> 00:29:04,457
<i>COMPUTER: ID confirmed.
Lieutenant Thorne.</i>

446
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:05,423
(GASPS)

447
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,724
She must've struggled.

448
00:29:28,657 --> 00:29:30,249
She must have
fought back.

449
00:29:30,258 --> 00:29:32,749
That doesn't justify this.
Stop it.

450
00:29:41,137 --> 00:29:42,297
Hello.

451
00:29:46,737 --> 00:29:48,637
Hello. Can you hear me?

452
00:29:54,098 --> 00:29:56,225
She's obviously been abused.

453
00:29:57,809 --> 00:29:59,834
Tortured.
Yes.

454
00:30:02,961 --> 00:30:06,624
But there's no obvious sign
of head trauma.

455
00:30:11,857 --> 00:30:13,085
Oh.

456
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:17,134
Voluntary eye movements
suggest conscious thought.

457
00:30:18,577 --> 00:30:21,876
Can't you stop being
a scientist for one moment

458
00:30:23,377 --> 00:30:26,210
and look at the abused woman
lying there in front of you?

459
00:30:32,465 --> 00:30:33,989
Now, listen up.

460
00:30:34,897 --> 00:30:37,263
I know this must be
very difficult for you.

461
00:30:37,298 --> 00:30:39,064
Don't patronize me.

462
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:42,213
I'm not patronizing you.
I'm trying to reason with you.

463
00:30:42,248 --> 00:30:45,338
If I'm going to help her, I
have to understand her first.

464
00:30:45,873 --> 00:30:47,898
Will you help her, Gaius?

465
00:30:48,657 --> 00:30:50,784
I will do everything I can.

466
00:30:53,137 --> 00:30:54,468
After all

467
00:30:55,857 --> 00:30:59,349
she is remarkably similar to
someone I care about a great deal.

468
00:31:02,705 --> 00:31:04,605
I think
it would be best

469
00:31:07,249 --> 00:31:09,547
if you left us alone
for a time.

470
00:31:21,618 --> 00:31:23,449
BALTAR: In order
for my technique to work,

471
00:31:23,484 --> 00:31:25,136
the technique
I used so successfully

472
00:31:25,137 --> 00:31:27,738
on the Cylon who called
herself Sharon Valerii,

473
00:31:27,773 --> 00:31:30,339
the prisoner must be
allowed to bathe adequately

474
00:31:30,374 --> 00:31:31,688
and eat.

475
00:31:32,178 --> 00:31:35,147
If proper clothes
could be provided and

476
00:31:35,217 --> 00:31:37,198
other sundry comforts,

477
00:31:37,233 --> 00:31:39,180
then that would be ideal.

478
00:31:39,473 --> 00:31:42,670
The comfort of that thing
is of no interest to me.

479
00:31:42,705 --> 00:31:45,237
It killed over 800 members
of my crew.

480
00:31:45,272 --> 00:31:46,725
If you'll permit me, Admiral,

481
00:31:46,737 --> 00:31:49,065
as I understand it, it
allowed a group of centurions

482
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,394
to board your ship, but
it itself did not commit...

483
00:31:51,429 --> 00:31:54,006
Are you making excuses
for it, Doctor?

484
00:31:56,209 --> 00:31:59,042
Have you become
too close to your subjects?

485
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:01,208
Lost perspective
perhaps?

486
00:32:01,713 --> 00:32:03,442
Quite the opposite.

487
00:32:03,633 --> 00:32:05,934
The Cylons are a brutal
and deadly opponent,

488
00:32:05,969 --> 00:32:08,096
the universe would be
a substantially better place

489
00:32:08,131 --> 00:32:10,572
if they were
exterminated entirely.

490
00:32:11,697 --> 00:32:13,961
But my job
is not extermination.

491
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:16,226
My job is investigation.

492
00:32:19,409 --> 00:32:22,037
It doesn't sound like
you're very good at it.

493
00:32:22,072 --> 00:32:23,913
You haven't told me
anything new.

494
00:32:23,948 --> 00:32:25,754
It suffered
no serious head injuries,

495
00:32:25,789 --> 00:32:27,337
and therefore
no physical damage

496
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:30,712
to its neural pathways or
cognitive reasoning centers.

497
00:32:30,747 --> 00:32:33,075
But it's quite clearly
traumatized.

498
00:32:33,553 --> 00:32:37,717
Which would suggest that its current
condition is psychological in nature.

499
00:32:37,752 --> 00:32:39,778
Had you thought of that?
No.

500
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:43,192
It shows that the Cylon
consciousness is just as susceptible

501
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:46,175
to the same pressures and
cleavages as the human psyche

502
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:48,910
and can be manipulated
in the same fashion.

503
00:32:48,945 --> 00:32:52,676
Simply put, Admiral, you
have already used the stick.

504
00:32:53,489 --> 00:32:55,650
It's time to use a carrot.

505
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:05,243
Please give the doctor
whatever he needs.

506
00:33:05,553 --> 00:33:06,815
Aye, sir.

507
00:33:11,473 --> 00:33:14,567
Mr. Vice President,
if you'd follow me, please.

508
00:33:15,185 --> 00:33:16,243
Sir.

509
00:33:17,073 --> 00:33:18,700
Lovely ship.
Thank you, sir.

510
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,866
Looks very new.
Yes, sir.

511
00:33:26,929 --> 00:33:28,692
Sorry to keep you waiting,
Commander.

512
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:31,871
And that I can't offer you
a place to sit.

513
00:33:32,113 --> 00:33:33,978
I've always preferred
to work standing up.

514
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:35,918
It's much easier
on my back.

515
00:33:35,953 --> 00:33:37,545
And I discovered
meetings with my officers

516
00:33:37,553 --> 00:33:39,248
go faster when they
have to stand as well,

517
00:33:39,249 --> 00:33:41,683
so, out went the chairs.

518
00:33:43,473 --> 00:33:45,230
I'll have to
remember that.

519
00:33:45,265 --> 00:33:47,927
Did you get a chance
to look around the ship?

520
00:33:48,305 --> 00:33:49,567
A little.

521
00:33:51,089 --> 00:33:53,614
It's been a while since
I've been on a Mercury class.

522
00:33:56,625 --> 00:33:57,819
To CIC.

523
00:34:00,881 --> 00:34:04,373
Ship's nearly twice the size,

524

<i>Makes me feel
the Galactica is a relic.</i>

525
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:10,926
<i>Galactica is not a relic.
It's a classic.</i>

526
00:34:10,961 --> 00:34:13,225
And I, for one, happen to
appreciate the classics.

527
00:34:14,257 --> 00:34:15,690
I've noticed.

528
00:34:16,401 --> 00:34:18,699
You have some
beautiful weapons.

529
00:34:19,281 --> 00:34:21,070
Commander,
having reviewed your logs,

530
00:34:21,105 --> 00:34:24,404
it appears that you've been
through quite an ordeal.

531
00:34:24,721 --> 00:34:26,764
We've had our moments.

532
00:34:26,799 --> 00:34:28,808
You did
yourselves proud.

533
00:34:29,585 --> 00:34:31,314
Thank you, Admiral.

534
00:34:31,761 --> 00:34:36,357
<i>As I told you, we were tracking a
Cylon Fleet when we found Galactica.</i>

535
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:41,321
And now that I've had a chance to
compare their route to your ship's logs,

536
00:34:41,393 --> 00:34:44,123
it's quite clear that
they've been following you.

537
00:34:44,529 --> 00:34:47,396
Our recon
so far tells us

538
00:34:47,697 --> 00:34:50,291
that the fleet is composed
of two Base Ships,

539
00:34:50,326 --> 00:34:52,622
about a dozen or so
support ships,

540
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:56,320
and one large vessel that we
are still unable to identify.

541
00:34:56,721 --> 00:34:59,281
It's this large ship here
that I'm interested in.

542
00:34:59,857 --> 00:35:03,293
What's its function? Is it
a command and control ship?

543
00:35:03,328 --> 00:35:04,878
A Raider factory?

544
00:35:05,009 --> 00:35:08,467
Possibly. Whatever it is,
the Cylons are protecting it.

545
00:35:09,361 --> 00:35:12,091
This is what I'd call
a tempting target.

546
00:35:15,889 --> 00:35:18,996
And here I was getting ready
to do a whole song and dance

547
00:35:19,031 --> 00:35:22,104
about combining resources
for a joint strike mission.

548
00:35:23,153 --> 00:35:26,247
Any chance of hitting
the Cylons where it hurts,

549
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,645
my pleasure.

550
00:35:30,129 --> 00:35:32,927
I'll have Apollo
coordinate with your CAG.

551
00:35:39,857 --> 00:35:42,883
Which leads me to the
next subject, Commander.

552
00:35:43,569 --> 00:35:45,710
I'm going to
integrate the crews.

553
00:35:45,745 --> 00:35:49,613
<i>And I'm starting by reassigning
Captain Adama to the Pegasus air wing.</i>

554
00:35:57,297 --> 00:36:00,232
I have a team
that works very well together.

555
00:36:04,273 --> 00:36:06,158
Let's just cut through it,
shall we?

556
00:36:06,193 --> 00:36:08,590
After reviewing your logs,
it is my judgment

557
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:12,527
<i>that having your son as Galactica
CAG has been a grave mistake.</i>

558
00:36:14,577 --> 00:36:17,358
He's been insubordinate,
even mutinous.

559
00:36:17,393 --> 00:36:20,362
And these are direct quotes
from your logs, by the way.

560
00:36:21,265 --> 00:36:24,782
And I dare say, he's not the only
one with disciplinary problems.

561
00:36:24,817 --> 00:36:29,516
There's a Kara Thrace who habitually
strikes fellow officers and disobeys orders.

562
00:36:29,551 --> 00:36:32,283
This Lieutenant Agathon
has fraternized with

563
00:36:32,318 --> 00:36:35,015
and evidently impregnated
an enemy agent.

564
00:36:37,521 --> 00:36:39,751
Let's not even
discuss your XO.

565
00:36:42,641 --> 00:36:43,733
So,

566
00:36:49,553 --> 00:36:52,147
there is a complete list
of the transfers.

567
00:36:52,401 --> 00:36:56,497
I thought you said you had no
desire to interfere with my command.

568
00:36:56,849 --> 00:36:59,044
I'm saving your command,
Bill.

569
00:36:59,473 --> 00:37:01,541
You're way too close
to these officers.

570
00:37:01,576 --> 00:37:03,566
And it's blinding you
to their weaknesses

571
00:37:03,601 --> 00:37:07,196
and to the damage that they're
doing to unit cohesion and to morale.

572
00:37:07,313 --> 00:37:08,803
I don't agree.

573
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:17,999
Well, that is
certainly your right.

574
00:37:23,377 --> 00:37:25,174
You have your orders.

should we do that?

Fine. We both have strong

Oh, you mean
an independent tribunal?

726

<i>Because according to
your logs, Commander,</i>

727

<i>you dissolved an independent tribunal
when you didn't like the verdict.</i>

728
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:58,832
And if I'm not mistaken, Chief
Tyrol was on trial there as well.

And sometimes

744
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,849
I forget there was
a world before the attack.

I knew someone,
a woman,

746

unlike any other woman
I'd ever known.

747
00:49:32,208 --> 00:49:33,766
She was unique.

748
00:49:35,184 --> 00:49:37,675
Beautiful. Clever.

749
00:49:39,696 --> 00:49:41,163
Intensely sensual.

750
00:49:41,168 --> 00:49:43,329

751
00:49:44,336 --> 00:49:46,270
she was in my thoughts.

752
00:49:47,792 --> 00:49:49,419
She was a Cylon.

753
00:49:50,448 --> 00:49:54,145
And she changed my life in a
very real, very fundamental way,

754
00:49:55,696 --> 00:49:59,393
in that I have quite literally
never stopped thinking about her.

755
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:02,993
Because I love her.

756
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,075

I weighed their statements
against those of the guards

794
00:53:39,472 --> 00:53:43,501
and I took into consideration their
service records and commendations.

795
