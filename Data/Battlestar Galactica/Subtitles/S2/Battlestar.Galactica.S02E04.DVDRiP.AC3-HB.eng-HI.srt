00:10:17,578 --> 00:10:19,367
Their captain says
they'll send fuel...

173
00:10:19,402 --> 00:10:21,416
once a civilian government
has been restored...

174
00:10:21,451 --> 00:10:24,682
<i>and, three other ships are also
refusing to re-supply Galactica...</i>

175
00:10:24,717 --> 00:10:27,246
until the President's
reinstated.

176
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:35,586
And I got a note from Combat, warning
about problems with tylium re-supply...

177
00:10:35,621 --> 00:10:37,832
so watch your fuel burn
until further notice.

178
00:10:37,994 --> 00:10:38,983
Questions?

179
00:10:39,018 --> 00:10:41,646
When you coming back
to the card game?

180
00:10:41,771 --> 00:10:46,105
I'm afraid when I'm off duty, I'll be enjoying
the intimate surroundings of the brig...

181
00:10:46,698 --> 00:10:49,086
until... well,
until further notice.

182
00:10:49,121 --> 00:10:50,976
Come on back.
We miss you, Captain.

183
00:10:51,011 --> 00:10:52,832
We could bring
the game to you.

184
00:10:52,842 --> 00:10:54,727
Somehow I doubt
Col. Tigh would approve.

185
00:10:54,762 --> 00:10:57,959
There's one going on tomorrow
night! Hey, all right. All right.

186
00:10:57,995 --> 00:11:00,088
Hey, knock it off!

187
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:02,385
Morning, sir.

188
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,776
Sergeant. Shall we?

189
00:11:04,907 --> 00:11:06,602
[People chattering]

190
00:11:06,637 --> 00:11:07,728
Morning, sir.

191
00:11:07,754 --> 00:11:09,381
Morning, Dee.
Fancy meeting you here.

192
00:11:09,386 --> 00:11:10,785
I was just on my way, sir.

193
00:11:10,827 --> 00:11:12,488
Hey, guys.
How's it going, Dee?

194
00:11:12,491 --> 00:11:13,719
Good, thanks.

195
00:11:14,442 --> 00:11:16,103
How's my father today?

196
00:11:16,138 --> 00:11:19,972
Commander Adama's the same,
Captain. He's sedated.

197
00:11:20,042 --> 00:11:22,602
Resting comfortably
since the surgery.

198
00:11:23,722 --> 00:11:26,555
Trouble brewing in the fleet,
though. Oh, I'm shocked.

199
00:11:26,635 --> 00:11:29,536
What kind of trouble? Martial
law isn't going down too well.

200
00:11:29,571 --> 00:11:31,656
Protests, demonstrations...

201
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,959
<i>some ships are even refusing
to re-supply Galactica.</i>

202
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:36,485
And this is the honeymoon
period. What's a dictator to do?

206
00:11:42,314 --> 00:11:44,305
I wish you were
in command, sir.

Dee...

208
00:11:46,027 --> 00:11:48,518
He's hitting
the bottle. A lot.

209
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:53,643
Thank you for the company,
Petty Officer Dualla.

210
00:11:53,678 --> 00:11:55,203
You're welcome, sir.

214
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,486
You okay, baby?

215
00:12:09,514 --> 00:12:12,950
No, I'm not okay. My head feels like
it's gonna roll off my shoulders.

216
00:12:12,985 --> 00:12:14,137
What are you working on?

217
00:12:14,154 --> 00:12:17,521
I'm trying to figure out how to
solve our re-supply problem...

218
00:12:17,578 --> 00:12:20,513
now that half the fleet
has gone out on strike.

219
00:12:20,548 --> 00:12:22,858
Are you serious?
Yes, I'm serious.

220
00:12:22,954 --> 00:12:26,472
I should probably call a summit. Sit
down with all the ship captains...

221
00:12:26,507 --> 00:12:29,991
and explain the situation and tell
them why I had to declare martial law.

222
00:12:30,378 --> 00:12:33,267
Screw them. Like you have
to explain yourself to them.

223
00:12:33,302 --> 00:12:36,157
It wouldn't hurt. Might
cool things down a little.

224
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,632
What?

225
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,819
Nothing.

No, No, No, it's...

227
00:12:45,707 --> 00:12:46,833
You're the boss.

228
00:12:46,858 --> 00:12:49,565
Far be it for me to tell you
how to do your job.

229
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,730
I know that's one of
your issues. Just say it.

230
00:12:52,765 --> 00:12:55,861
I don't know, it just
feels kind of touchy-feely.

231
00:12:55,882 --> 00:13:00,114
You know, "Let's all sit down and talk
about how we feel about martial law."

232

Bill would
never do that.

But you gotta do
what you gotta do...

234
00:13:05,067 --> 00:13:08,628
I mean, Bill may never
get on his feet again.

Honey, you handle this

eventually.

Mr. Gaeta, send the following

00:13:29,034 --> 00:13:33,164
"Re-supply operations of this

00:13:38,163 --> 00:13:42,288
"Failure to comply will result
in stern measures."

00:13:42,323 --> 00:13:43,772
Message ends.

245
00:13:47,722 --> 00:13:48,916
You happy now?

246
00:13:50,314 --> 00:13:52,441

00:14:51,562 --> 00:14:53,496
We're not Cylons.

253
00:14:54,474 --> 00:14:56,840
Right. You're human.

254
00:14:56,842 --> 00:14:59,936
You have a soul. You swim in the
stream. We heard it all before.

255
00:14:59,971 --> 00:15:02,535
Hey, Colonial Fleet.
Notice the uniforms?

256
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,095
Yeah, right. We've seen
Cylons in uniform before.

257

We're human.
Yeah, right.

Caprica is dead. You're not.

Yeah, that's right.

Sue-shaun, Crip-key, Morris Fink.

Please. Try.

00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,640
Okay, since we're all
getting along so well...

268
00:15:35,675 --> 00:15:38,119
can people stop
pointing their guns at us?

Raiding military stores for
ammo, anti-radiation meds...

275
00:15:52,698 --> 00:15:55,045

whenever they show up.

00:15:55,082 --> 00:15:56,447

00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:57,652
Okay.

00:15:58,922 --> 00:16:02,050

or you have a bullet.

Wrong. Four.

00:16:11,498 --> 00:16:14,990
Three. Last one was
called back on instant replay.

He's right, Starbuck.

You can't shoot, you can't pass, and
you sure as hell can't take a point.

Madam President.

296

And a little something
from the galley.

00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,960
Thank you, Cpl. Venner.

298
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:09,937

00:17:11,402 --> 00:17:12,733
Me, too.

301
00:17:18,186 --> 00:17:21,019
It's interesting he still
calls you, "Madam President."

302

You still have
a lot of supporters out there.

303
00:17:28,106 --> 00:17:31,166
Something ugly is coming.
I can feel it.

304
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:35,143
Sir, the refinery captain's
still not cooperating.

And now seven
other container ships...

306
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:41,533
are refusing to release their
supplies, food, medicine, even coffee.

307
00:17:41,568 --> 00:17:44,613
Coffee?
This is getting ridiculous.

308
00:17:44,682 --> 00:17:48,345
Frak this. It's time to get their
attention. I'm sending in the Marines.

309
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:51,360
I want a Raptor and an armed
Marine boarding party...

310
00:17:51,395 --> 00:17:53,962
for every ship
refusing the re-supply order.

311
00:17:53,997 --> 00:17:56,243
Sir, we're stretched
pretty thin on manpower.

312
00:17:56,278 --> 00:17:58,490
I'm not sure we have
enough Marine non-coms...

313
00:17:58,525 --> 00:18:00,374
to command
that many boarding parties.

314
00:18:00,409 --> 00:18:02,311
Pull pilots
and deck officers...

315
00:18:02,346 --> 00:18:04,455
to command the boarding
parties if you have to.

316
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:07,186
Tell them to get over there
and bring back the supplies.

317
00:18:07,221 --> 00:18:08,670
Whatever it takes.

318
00:18:08,746 --> 00:18:10,771
Make it happen, Lieutenant.
Yes, sir.

319
00:18:19,178 --> 00:18:21,085
People, step back.
All right.

320
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,951

for the supplies!

to shoot on that crowd?

No, sir. Of course not.

337

338

No, sir, but...

00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:29,351
you had to be there. They were
yelling and screaming at us...

341
00:19:29,386 --> 00:19:32,617
and then it got violent. They
started throwing things, canisters...

342
00:19:33,962 --> 00:19:36,260
coffee, I think.
Coffee?

343
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:38,949
You shot people
for throwing coffee?

it's right now.

It'll cause an explosion in the fleet.

a field day.

begin to splinter.

eliminate us a few ships at a time.

Of course you do.

358

I've worked out a way of
getting us in the hangar deck...

359
00:20:38,235 --> 00:20:40,213
and I can get us a Raptor.

360
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:43,210

clearance to get off the ship.

You do?

Mmm-hmm. The question is, where
do we go once we get off this ship?

363
00:20:48,044 --> 00:20:50,106
We'll have to find some place
to hide in the fleet...

among the people.

supposed to be me alone.

not want a command, don't you get it?

listen to you?

you to send troops out to that ship.

375

No, no. You didn't tell
me to send troops anywhere.

I covered up your true nature from the
rest of the fleet for my own purposes.

here and allow that to happen.

512
00:29:58,101 --> 00:30:01,852
So I intend to go through that
hatch and get off this ship.

513
00:30:04,745 --> 00:30:08,237
Damn it. They should
be here by now.

514
00:30:09,001 --> 00:30:12,596
You can either stand aside
or you can shoot me.

515
00:30:13,033 --> 00:30:15,866
You'll have to decide
where your duty lies.

516
00:30:18,889 --> 00:30:21,153
Madam President...

517
00:30:37,161 --> 00:30:39,078
Madam President,
this way.

518
00:30:39,113 --> 00:30:41,104
Oh, Billy...
Madam President...

519
00:30:41,609 --> 00:30:43,600
I'm not getting
on that ship with you.

520
00:30:46,474 --> 00:30:47,736
What?

521
00:30:48,457 --> 00:30:51,449
I understand
what you're trying to do.

522
00:30:51,689 --> 00:30:54,726
But it's gonna
divide the fleet.

523
00:30:54,761 --> 00:30:59,027
At the very best, it'll create an insurgency
against Adama and at the worst, a civil war.

524
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:02,042
Taking part in that
is a line that I won't cross.

525
00:31:02,077 --> 00:31:04,826
(Apollo)
We do not have a lot of time.

526
00:31:09,417 --> 00:31:11,612
I wish you well.

527
00:31:28,233 --> 00:31:30,636
Dustoff two-seven,
Checkers green...

528
00:31:30,671 --> 00:31:33,040
ready for launch
on medical mission.

529
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:34,590
Request clearance.

530
00:31:35,753 --> 00:31:37,311
Good to see you. You okay?

531
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:40,812
I think so. My feet barely
touched the ground getting here.

532
00:31:40,847 --> 00:31:42,076
I know what you mean.

533
00:31:42,089 --> 00:31:45,115
<i>(man on radio) Dustoff two-seven,
Standard port three departure approved.</i>

534
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,259
<i>Cleared for launch.</i>

535
00:31:46,442 --> 00:31:49,002
Standard port three, wilco.

536
00:32:01,321 --> 00:32:04,256
Sir, Cpl. Venner reports the
former President's missing.

537
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:06,192
Missing?
Two men down. Cell's empty.

538
00:32:06,227 --> 00:32:07,277
Damn it.

539
00:32:07,305 --> 00:32:11,139
Alert security. Set Condition
Two. No one on or off the ship.

540
00:32:11,209 --> 00:32:12,699
[Alarm blaring]

541
00:32:12,713 --> 00:32:15,210
Attention. Set Condition
Two throughout the ship.

542
00:32:15,245 --> 00:32:17,707
Repeat. Set Condition
Two throughout the ship.

543
00:32:23,401 --> 00:32:27,201
Sir, flight log records a Raptor
departed ship two minutes ago...

544
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:29,172
with Doc Cottle
on a medical emergency.

545
00:32:29,207 --> 00:32:31,254
Medical? Confirm that.

546
00:32:31,337 --> 00:32:35,103
Dradis has their transponder
bearing 2-8-7 carom 0-0-3.

547
00:32:35,138 --> 00:32:36,382
Range 2-7.

548
00:32:36,425 --> 00:32:38,484
Get the CAP on the horn
and have them intercept.

549
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:41,067
And get Captain Adama
out of the brig.

550
00:32:41,929 --> 00:32:44,390
Sir, Doctor Cottle
is still onboard.

551
00:32:44,425 --> 00:32:47,952
He says he was forced to request
the Raptor at gunpoint by Apollo.

552
00:32:47,987 --> 00:32:49,781
Son-of-a-bitch.

553
00:32:49,897 --> 00:32:52,092
Dee, put me through
to that Raptor.

554
00:32:55,401 --> 00:32:57,631
(Gaeta)
CAP has visual on the target.

555
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:02,072
Turn that ship around, Apollo, or
I'll order the CAP to shoot you down.

556
00:33:02,107 --> 00:33:03,085
<i>(Apollo)
We're not turning back.</i>

557
00:33:03,113 --> 00:33:04,137
I'll do it.

558
00:33:04,169 --> 00:33:06,660
And don't think I won't just
because you're the old man's son.

559
00:33:06,953 --> 00:33:09,751
<i>Then do what you have to do,
Galactica.</i>

560
00:33:10,345 --> 00:33:11,778
Apollo out.

561
00:33:14,889 --> 00:33:16,880
Fire across their bow.

562
00:33:17,801 --> 00:33:20,827
<i>Hotdog, Galactica. Fire
across their bow. Acknowledge.</i>

563
00:33:21,129 --> 00:33:22,994
<i>Wilco, Galactica.</i>

564
00:33:27,369 --> 00:33:30,304
Hotdog reports they're
not turning around, sir.

565
00:33:31,529 --> 00:33:32,723
Where are they now?

566
00:33:32,745 --> 00:33:34,733
Dradis shows them
approaching Cloud Nine.

567
00:33:34,768 --> 00:33:36,678
(Gaeta) Sir, if they
dock, we may lose them.

568
00:33:36,713 --> 00:33:39,204
Cloud Nine is one of the busiest
transport hubs in the fleet.

569
00:33:39,239 --> 00:33:40,870
Shuttles are coming
and going constantly.

570
00:33:40,905 --> 00:33:44,671
If they board one and take off, it'll
be before we can shut down air traffic.

571
00:33:47,177 --> 00:33:50,374
<i>Galactica, Hotdog.
Request instructions.</i>

572
00:33:51,305 --> 00:33:53,899
<i>Galactica, Hotdog.
I need further instructions.</i>

573
00:33:53,934 --> 00:33:55,524
<i>Do I fire or not?</i>

574
00:34:02,505 --> 00:34:04,905
Dee, tell Hotdog
to hold his fire.

575
00:34:04,937 --> 00:34:07,303
Repeat, weapons hold.
Do not fire.

576
00:34:07,369 --> 00:34:11,237
<i>Hotdog, Galactica. Weapons
hold. Repeat, do not fire.</i>

577
00:34:11,721 --> 00:34:13,416
[People murmuring]

578
00:34:15,017 --> 00:34:17,679
They couldn't have done it
on their own.

579
00:34:18,857 --> 00:34:22,850
Anybody notice off-log calls?
Scrambled communications?

580
00:34:24,233 --> 00:34:27,396
No, sir. Nothing.

581
00:34:43,273 --> 00:34:45,764
Well, we're home free
for now.

582
00:34:48,777 --> 00:34:51,211
(Zarek) Good to see
you, Madam President.

583
00:34:54,313 --> 00:34:55,974
Captain Apollo...

584
00:34:57,129 --> 00:34:59,427
what is Mr. Zarek
doing here?

585
00:34:59,977 --> 00:35:03,538
Once Tigh gets over his initial shock,
he'll send troops out to search for us.

586
00:35:03,573 --> 00:35:05,888
If we're going to make it
we have to keep on the move.

587
00:35:05,923 --> 00:35:08,134
I figured Mr. Zarek here is
the only one in the fleet...

588
00:35:08,169 --> 00:35:11,570
with enough shady friends around
who could possibly hide us.

589
00:35:11,721 --> 00:35:13,916
I love the way
he puts that.

590
00:35:14,249 --> 00:35:18,777
Well, Mr. Zarek. It would seem
the enemy of my enemy is my friend.

591
00:35:18,812 --> 00:35:20,064
Call me Tom.

592
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:22,396
A shuttle's waiting, ma'am.
We have to hurry.

593
00:35:23,337 --> 00:35:24,634
[Sighing]

594
00:35:34,601 --> 00:35:36,364
Wow, is that the best
you can do?

595
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:39,231
Nice to know installing a
regulation pyramid court...

596
00:35:39,266 --> 00:35:41,222
was one of the priorities
of the Resistance.

597
00:35:41,257 --> 00:35:44,055
Well, there are some things
one cannot live without.

598
00:35:45,033 --> 00:35:46,227
Let's go.

599
00:35:46,537 --> 00:35:48,732
(Anders) Are you kidding me?
I'd wipe the court with you.

600
00:35:48,777 --> 00:35:51,109
We'll see about that.

601
00:35:51,337 --> 00:35:52,998
I was up for the pros.

602
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,907
Bum knee took me
out of contention.

603
00:35:56,041 --> 00:35:57,235
I see.

604
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:00,853
Is that gonna be your excuse
when I kick your ass?

605
00:36:01,097 --> 00:36:02,758
"My poor knee hurts."

606
00:36:02,857 --> 00:36:06,918
At least I have an excuse. I can't
imagine what yours is gonna be.

607
00:36:23,593 --> 00:36:25,151
[Both grunting]

608
00:36:32,553 --> 00:36:33,747
[Yells]

609
00:36:42,601 --> 00:36:45,161
Nice shot.
Thanks.

610
00:36:55,625 --> 00:36:57,957
Thanks, Doc.
I appreciate it.

611
00:36:58,185 --> 00:37:01,093
Don't thank me. Thank her.

612
00:37:01,128 --> 00:37:03,653
(Tyrol) Why? What did
she have to do with it?

613
00:37:04,041 --> 00:37:05,269
(Baltar)
Everything.

614
00:37:05,576 --> 00:37:07,203
Nothing.

615
00:37:12,009 --> 00:37:16,969
Love is a strange
and wonderful thing, Chief.

616
00:37:18,473 --> 00:37:21,567
You'd be happy
you experienced it at all.

617
00:37:21,801 --> 00:37:24,429
Even if it was
with a machine.

618
00:37:25,321 --> 00:37:27,016
(Tyrol) What're they going to do to her?

619
00:37:27,017 --> 00:37:29,508
They're setting up
a new holding facility.

620
00:37:29,576 --> 00:37:33,478
There will be tests,
mental, physical.

621
00:37:33,577 --> 00:37:36,705
Like she's... Like she's
some kind of lab rat?

622
00:37:38,729 --> 00:37:40,390
That's the idea.

623
00:37:43,305 --> 00:37:45,398
This is just great.

624
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:49,508
Bill Adama's little baby boy
pulls the wool over your eyes...

625
00:37:49,543 --> 00:37:51,544
and you let him
get away scot free.

626
00:37:51,579 --> 00:37:53,554
You're a laughingstock.

627
00:37:53,641 --> 00:37:55,939
You didn't want
this command.

628
00:37:55,977 --> 00:37:58,673
Well, don't worry about it. You
won't have it for much longer.

629
00:37:58,708 --> 00:38:02,432
All because when push came
to shove, you got shoved.

630
00:38:02,467 --> 00:38:03,903
It was his son.

631
00:38:03,913 --> 00:38:05,540
(Adama)
Saul.

632
00:38:12,424 --> 00:38:15,154
What's happening on my ship?

633
00:38:18,633 --> 00:38:21,094
Wait in the corridor.

634
00:38:21,129 --> 00:38:24,155
Ellen, can I speak to my XO?

635
00:38:24,233 --> 00:38:25,723
Of course.

636
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:35,097
[Grunting]
Slow.

637
00:38:35,816 --> 00:38:37,113
[Panting]

638
00:38:39,017 --> 00:38:41,144
What's happened?

639
00:38:42,089 --> 00:38:44,717
I've frakked things up
and good.

640
00:38:45,193 --> 00:38:47,787
How?
I made some bad calls.

641
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,224
[Chuckles]

642
00:38:49,256 --> 00:38:51,884
I've done that.
Not like these.

643
00:38:52,617 --> 00:38:55,586
You gonna pour us one
of those or what? Yeah.

644
00:38:58,441 --> 00:39:02,537
I never had much use for people
who second-guessed my decisions...

645
00:39:04,201 --> 00:39:06,965
especially if they've never
held a command.

646
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,183
They don't understand
the pressure.

647
00:39:10,728 --> 00:39:12,958
You make a call...

648
00:39:13,481 --> 00:39:16,177
that affects
the lives of thousands...

649
00:39:16,488 --> 00:39:19,286
and you have no one
to turn to for backup.

650
00:39:19,321 --> 00:39:21,334
(Tigh)
You make it look easy.

651
00:39:21,705 --> 00:39:23,798
You know that's a lie now.

652
00:39:26,729 --> 00:39:28,890
A lot of pieces to pick up.

653
00:39:29,832 --> 00:39:33,427
Then we'll pick them up
together. Where's my son?

654
00:39:35,336 --> 00:39:38,066
(man) Bitch! (woman) Traitor!

655
00:39:38,249 --> 00:39:39,876
[People yelling]

656
00:39:55,048 --> 00:39:56,447
[Gun fires]

657
00:40:19,881 --> 00:40:21,280
[Mumbling]

658
00:40:21,865 --> 00:40:24,698
No, no, no, no.

659
00:40:29,352 --> 00:40:30,376
[Gasping]

660
00:40:30,408 --> 00:40:32,535
I love you, Chief.
