1
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:23,782
Previously on Battlestar Galactica.

2
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:26,417
I feel like I'm abandoning my post.

3
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:29,018
It's time to pack it
in, Saul. You know it.

4
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:33,023
More than half the crew's
down on New Caprica already,

5
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:36,426
I'm not really doing
too much up here anymore.

6
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:37,970
Good luck.

7
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,032
Oh, my Gods. It's the
Cylon Fleet. They found us.

8
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:45,634
There's only one way
that this mission ends,

9
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,112
and that's with the successful rescue

10
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:50,513
of our people off of New Caprica,

11
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,077
You brought them home, Saul.

12
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,145
Not all of them.

13
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,489
What about us?

14
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:59,057
There is no "us," all right?

15
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,117
There is nothing here.

16
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:02,661
Do you get that? Nothing!

17
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:07,126
Lee, when are you gonna
get yourself a girl?

18
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,134
I'm doing fine, thank you.

19
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,203
You're not still
frakking Dualla, are you?

20
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:14,338
I am proud to serve
with you, Lieutenant,

21
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:16,909
and to call you my wife.

22
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:20,010
I'm in a different place now.

23
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:24,541
I just want to hurt someone,
and it might as well be you.

24
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:17,466
Admiral?

25
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:19,970
Admiral?

26
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:25,506
Sir, Engineering is requesting
more time for the nav upgrade again.

27
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:28,939
Maintenance, flight ops, weapons.

28
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:31,916
We're seeing botched drills,
missed deadlines across the board.

29
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:35,716
Meanwhile, half the crew's belowdecks.

30
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:38,987
Are you telling me something's
wrong with this picture?

31
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:40,787
Sir, I suggest we cancel tonight.

32
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,656
Call everyone back to duty.

33
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,926
No, no.

34
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:48,795
The crew needs this.
Maybe we all need it.

35
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:51,393
Adjust our heads a little bit, refocus.

36
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:54,098
You do, too, Dee. Go put your tags in.

37
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:55,731
We'll catch up.

38
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:56,866
Sir.

39
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:32,106
That was exactly what I needed.

40
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:41,912
Glad to be of service.

41
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:44,650
When do they need you
back on the Caprica?

42
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:48,524
Why? Itching to get rid of me already?

43
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:50,295
Did I say anything like that?

44
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,897
You didn't have to.

45
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:57,730
Look, Sam, this is pretty much
all that I can handle right now.

46
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:02,165
Damn it.

47
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:03,400
Looking for this?

48
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:07,304
Yeah.

49
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,012
Kara,

50
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:16,355
I know you went through hell on
that rock and I was very patient.

51
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:20,449
But I want you back.

52
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:25,887
I want our marriage back,
I want a real marriage.

53
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:31,261
And what if I'm just not ready for that?

54
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:37,005
I don't know, then I
guess it'll never be.

55
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:44,415
Maybe 'cause I'm not what
you really want after all.

56
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:53,924
If that's how you really feel,

57
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:59,363
I'm not gonna try and change your mind.

58
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,561
I'm not.

59
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,342
I'm late for the dance.

60
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:28,384
Don't forget your boots
on the way out, Sammy.

61
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:39,196
You can fight them, Lee, come on!

62
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:20,576
If it isn't the fighting Agathon.

63
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:23,240
Starbuck, late to the party as usual.

64
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,245
At least I got here in time to
watch you kick the CAG's ass.

65
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,412
You got it, slick him right up.

66
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,191
He's a tough little
frakker, I'll give him that.

67
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,557
He's playing me like
he's got it in for me.

68
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:35,992
You know what? That's his weakness.

69
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,757
When he charges in, he drops his right.

70
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,320
Okay? Okay. All right.

71
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:45,035
You can do this, Karl. Come on.

72
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:58,707
Not bad. Couple of months ago,

73
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,275
you would've had to
roll him into this ring.

74
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:01,911
Well, not anymore.

75
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:05,389
You know, with a cooler head,
he might have had a chance.

76
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,053
Come on!

77
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:10,444
TIGH: One,

78
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:13,614
two,

79
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,484
three,

80
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:19,753
four,

81
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:23,123
five,

82
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,559
six,

83
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:28,095
seven.

84
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,108
Hey, hey, hey. All right, look at me.

85
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,025
You did it, baby.

86
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,935
Fischer. Fischer, you're up.

87
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:01,571
You did fine.

88
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:07,303
Bit off a little more
than you could chew, huh?

89
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,248
Come on, Lee. Don't be that way.

90
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,084
Stick around, the night's young.

91
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:24,426
Well, I guess then you'll just
have to enjoy it without me.

92
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:26,662
Why don't you track down Anders?

93
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,699
He's always good for a laugh.

94
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:41,336
Oh, trouble in paradise.

95
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,440
Now why doesn't that surprise me?

96
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:49,847
Yeah, well, maybe if you
had found us both a billet

97
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,948
we wouldn't be living
on different ships, huh?

98
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:56,119
I don't believe this.

99
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:58,288
You're blaming me for
your frakked up marriage?

100
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:03,594
Didn't really help it off to
a good start, now, did you?

101
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,241
Now, just how far do
you want to push this?

102
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:13,437
Hmm?

103
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,683
How about this far?

104
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:30,793
Now who's biting off more
than they can chew, Captain?

105
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:34,360
Not me from where I'm standing, Major.

106
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,611
Excuse me.

107
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:47,371
He's looking good.

108
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:48,973
I'm glad he lost the weight.

109
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,032
Yeah, so am I.

110
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:53,434
Bye.

111
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,552
Hey, ladies.

112
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:06,618
It was a great combination.

113
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:08,216
Great fight, Lee.

114
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,884
Fought with a lot of heart, man.

115
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:15,125
How's my favorite gladiator?

116
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,263
Good morning, Commander.

117
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:26,002
Ready to go back to our ship?

118
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:44,922
Hey, if you're done brawling, how
about we arrange a private tussle?

119
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,691
Well, actually I have another bout.

120
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:02,480
Colonel.

121
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:08,886
How's it going tonight?

122
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,149
Couple of good bouts so far.

123
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:13,418
And you? How're you doing?

124
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:17,292
I'd rather go back to my rock and
crawl under the covers with a bottle,

125
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:20,264
but you were right,
this was a good idea.

126
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,664
No use going backwards, might as
well get used to the bright lights.

127
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:25,996
Let's go. Let's go!

128
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,418
There you are.

129
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,043
Hey, how are you?

130
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,093
I didn't expect to find
you playing in the sand.

131
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:54,489
It's not sand.

132
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:59,065
It's alluvial deposits. This
used to be the river mouth.

133
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:02,667
And you just had to take off your shoes

134
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:05,003
and play in the alluvial deposits.

135
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,203
How romantic.

136
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:11,880
That's a nice color on you.

137
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,382
Thank you.

138
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,257
It's good to see you, Laura.

139
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:22,016
You, too, Bill.

140
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:34,231
What?

141
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:37,798
Nothing.

142
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:41,277
My father was an avid fight fan.

143
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:43,813
I adored my father so
I love a good fight.

144
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:49,011
I heard about your so-called dance.

145
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,853
Accidentally, I might add.

146
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:55,621
Don't take it personally.

147
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:58,457
It's sort of a private tradition.

148
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:59,827
Tradition?

149
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,959
There's a lot of
frustration aboard warships.

150
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,902
Arguments become grudges
and end up being feuds.

151
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:10,570
It allows them to let off some steam,

152
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:13,669
out in the open so
everybody can participate.

153
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:17,079
Rank doesn't matter. As long as
you throw your tags in the box,

154
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:18,980
everyone's fair game.

155
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:28,386
Did you throw your tags in there?

156
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,222
No.

157
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,198
No. I wish,

158
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:38,394
with all the frustrations that I have.

159
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:42,133
Congratulations. I
may be jumping the gun,

160
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:46,276
but first boy born on Galactica,

161
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:52,013
That's the thing I wanted
to talk to you about, sir.

162
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,884
Cally doesn't want him born here.

163
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,257
And neither do I. Not if he has a chance

164
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:01,325
to grow up breathing fresh air.

165
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:02,621
What are you saying?

166
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:03,989
Thank you.

167
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:07,863
Well, we both would like to
request to be relieved of duty

168
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:09,662
and resettle in New Caprica.

169
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:11,828
No. No way.

170
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,064
Look, you're both here for the duration.

171
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:32,421
Next up is Hotdog.

172
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:36,152
Hotdog, get your butt up
here and pick a partner.

173
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:41,694
Come on there, champ.

174
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,735
TIGH: Who's your partner, Hotdog?

175
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:45,837
Starbuck.

176
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:49,399
You gotta be kidding, right?

177
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,666
Go, Starbuck. He's yours.

178
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:21,103
When I was six years old, there
was this boy in my neighborhood,

179
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:24,165
he used to wait for me after
school and knock me down.

180
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,278
Know what my mom told me?

181
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:30,938
It wasn't because I pissed him off.

182
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:36,384
I wasn't too much older when I realized

183
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,820
that the other side of hatred is love.

184
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:44,653
It was passion.

185
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,856
Karl is angry at Lee
after all this time.

186
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:51,099
What is this fight really about?

187
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:58,499
That's it.

188
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,527
TIGH: Come on. Come on!

189
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:23,794
She's just been pissing me
the frak off, that's all.

190
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:26,463
Now she's throwing down the gauntlet.

191
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:31,341
That's it. That's the
way to fight! Go, go, go.

192
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:39,775
Can't believe the progress they've made.

193
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:42,150
You should've seen it a month ago.

194
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:45,379
But I'd still rather sleep
in a warm bunk every night

195
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,290
than muck around in this muck.

196
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:51,321
Bunk's gonna be plenty warm tonight.

197
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:54,530
He said yes.

198
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,094
He approved the transfer?

199
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:58,362
Yeah.

200
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:05,575
You two just don't know how
to keep a secret, do you?

201
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:09,908
So, what, are you guys here to see
Baltar put a shovel in the ground?

202
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:13,418
"Join the celebration as we break
ground for a better tomorrow. "

203
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,952
Aw, such a load of crap.

204
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:18,018
There's an open bar.

205
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,423
Really? See, now why didn't you say so?

206
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,852
Lee, you've got to let your
better half do the talking for you.

207
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:25,988
She gets right to the point.

208
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:29,189
Let's go find us a better tomorrow.

209
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,833
Excuse us.

210
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:33,998
Knock yourself out.

211
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:37,632
Thank you, Sam.

212
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:06,497
Thank you, Thank you,

213
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:13,200
Let this day be remembered as
the day that we broke the ground

214
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:16,509
for our new tomorrow,

215
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,000
Your fly's open.

216
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:41,935
Shut up.

217
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,278
No, it gets better, okay?

218
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:53,283
They come back to the locker room

219
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,852
with a set of handcuffs and some straw.

220
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:59,889
They're not gonna be friends, are they?

221
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:03,951
You know, I've always
wanted to date a ballplayer.

222
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:05,894
Such great arms.

223
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:09,327
Guess he's kind of taken now.

224
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:11,663
Yeah. Kind of.

225
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:16,241
Weather usually sucks down here anyway.

226
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:17,502
Yeah.

227
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:21,845
You know, I was thinking
it's probably better

228
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:24,313
to have a baby on Galactica anyways.

229
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:29,147
You know, there's a sick
bay, doctors, medicine.

230
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:33,551
Yeah. No, it'll be better.

231
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,155
Yeah, we'll be happier.

232
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,022
Yeah.

233
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:47,199
Hey, baby. Hi.

234
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,189
I heard Sam was aboard,

235
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:16,757
He was?

236
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,870
With any luck, he's gone now.

237
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:22,464
What happened?

238
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:24,234
Same thing that always happens.

239
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:27,712
Why can't they just make things simple?

240
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,837
They start thinking that they own you...

241
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,316
They? Which they are we talking about?

242
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:35,386
Sam or Lee?

243
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:46,022
I don't want you to fight her.

244
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:53,336
Dee, this has nothing to do with us.

245
00:22:57,275 --> 00:23:00,142
Kara and I, we got a
score we gotta settle.

246
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,942
And we're gonna settle it
tonight one way or another.

247
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:05,411
Set! Call the next set.

248
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,847
Okay, who's next?

249
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:09,250
Hey, come here.

250
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:14,623
You keep giving me these weird looks.

251
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:17,025
Come on, can't a man look at his wife?

252
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:18,726
Come on.

253
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:20,653
Where?

254
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:24,131
Did I ever tell you how
glad I am I married you?

255
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:25,692
Not once.

256
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:30,132
Well, then I'll save it
for a special occasion.

257
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:32,506
Come here.

258
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:42,108
He's been making the same
mistake since the day he met me.

259
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:45,022
When you were with Zak?

260
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,684
Yeah. And now I'm with Sam.

261
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,420
I don't even know why
I'm telling you this.

262
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:57,095
'Cause they say confession's
good for the soul.

263
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:00,828
Yeah! Yeah.

264
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:07,739
I'll tell you the secret
to avoid hangovers.

265
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:10,109
Don't stop drinking.

266
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:19,081
It's combat. Survival
instinct starts to kick in.

267
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:22,588
Make your choice, don't look back.

268
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,990
That's a beautiful combination.

269
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:30,398
What did I miss?

270
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,334
Figurski, you done that bird already?

271
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:34,872
No, the damn gyro's giving me trouble.

272
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:37,474
Come on, Chief, I'm
the only one over there.

273
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:43,205
Frak. Frak it, get yourself a drink.

274
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,052
Ship down, Chief?

275
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,917
Yeah, we'll get it tomorrow.

276
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:52,887
I figured I'd give him a little R&R.

277
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:57,157
No! Get off the ropes,
get off the ropes!

278
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:06,862
It's a dance, remember?

279
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:13,410
Yeah, you know, we've had our
share of set-backs, to be sure,

280
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:16,038
but I'm confident that with
our new development plan

281
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:18,048
we should have the
infrastructure to be able

282
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:20,016
to deal with any
unforeseen circumstances...

283
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:23,054
Excuse me, sir. The finance
minister. I'll be back.

284
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:24,418
Go ahead.

285
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:28,084
Oh, my God. I thought he'd never leave.

286
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,820
He's a good kid.

287
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,339
You're saying this
stuff grows around here?

288
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:45,674
In the mountains north of
here, there's this little stream

289
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:47,974
that comes down into this lake.

290
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,211
The water's so clear, it's
like looking through glass.

291
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:56,648
I'm thinking of building a cabin.

292
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,564
It's good.

293
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:11,927
Mmm.

294
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:13,935
It is good.

295
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,173
Hey, get out there.

296
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:25,908
Come on.

297
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:29,754
No, I don't think so. Come on.

298
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:31,311
No, no, no.

299
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:38,715
Okay, I'm out of here.

300
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,052
What? Yeah.

301
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:41,319
Come on, things are
just getting warmed up.

302
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:42,724
I know, exactly.

303
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:44,091
Come on, dance.

304
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,722
Look, you're catching
more than a few looks,

305
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:48,925
Mr. Commander of the Pegasus,

306
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,935
Hey. You know what? Screw them.

307
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:57,236
Hey, we've kept this under wraps
so far, okay? Let's not blow it.

308
00:27:58,543 --> 00:28:02,274
Anyway, especially not
before I'm about to transfer.

309
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:07,616
I'll go. You stay.

310
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,745
I'm not staying without you.

311
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:13,079
Yes, you are. No, I'm not.

312
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:14,853
Yes, you are. No. I'm not.

313
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,051
I've never seen you this happy.

314
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,721
I haven't seen you this happy ever.

315
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:26,169
You stay right here, you
get drunk out of your mind,

316
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:28,034
and tomorrow you'll
have a giant hangover.

317
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,198
Tomorrow night I'll come
and make it all better

318
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:35,440
when I report to my new
commander, in private.

319
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:38,681
You can talk me into it.

320
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,502
Back on Colonial One I grew so tired

321
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:03,971
of looking at the stars
through the window.

322
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:12,172
Now at night I go outside
and stare and stare.

323
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:29,491
Ever see a little light
Before the dawn of the light

324
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:34,671
Got a woman by a stream

325
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:40,542
Gonna show her all my dreams

326
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:45,106
What the hell is that?

327
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:49,880
A pilot friend of mine used to
sing it in the cockpit all the time.

328
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:54,422
What was his name? Juan.

329
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,462
Juan. That's nice.

330
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:02,397
Juan Calvin.

331
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:06,426
Is this really it, Bill?

332
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:12,670
Is this how we're going to
spend all the rest of our days?

333
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:50,114
Yeah. You the man.

334
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:55,147
Can you hold these? Thank you.

335
00:31:16,741 --> 00:31:17,833
Chief.

336
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:22,709
Get your fat, lazy ass up here.

337
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:37,085
Is he serious?

338
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,820
Let's watch and find out.

339
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:42,194
Helo.

340
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,167
Make them tight.

341
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,402
Yes, sir.

342
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,450
He's an old man. It'll be fine.

343
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,487
He's not serious anyways.

344
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,126
Sure about this?

345
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:21,628
It's your funeral.

346
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:33,313
Yeah! Do it, buddy.

347
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:02,477
Get up, Chief. We're
just getting started.

348
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,021
Come on, Chief.

349
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:06,705
I bring offerings.

350
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:12,048
Just in time. I was
running on bingo fuel.

351
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:16,112
Wow, look at that.

352
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:18,415
You literally drank
Anders under the table.

353
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:27,061
They just don't make them
like they used to, do they?

354
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,702
Where's Dee?

355
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,138
She packed it in to go pack.

356
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:45,045
Guess it's just you and me then.

357
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:49,677
Yup, it's just you and me.

358
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:20,981
Is this how you fight
your enemies, Chief?

359
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,485
Is this how you fight for your life?

360
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:29,118
No excuses. Show me
you're a soldier. Get up.

361
00:35:30,194 --> 00:35:31,991
Show him to your fullest.

362
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:33,860
That's it, Chief. Show him.

363
00:35:57,855 --> 00:35:59,117
Come on!

364
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,167
Is that what you want?
Is that what you wanted?

365
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,247
You know,

366
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:30,318
maybe we should just enjoy this.

367
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:35,653
I am.

368
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,125
No, no, I mean, enjoy being here

369
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:41,527
on this planet as long as it lasts.

370
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:45,797
I mean, maybe the Cylons
come back, maybe they don't.

371
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:51,240
But for now, right
now, we've got a break.

372
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:53,709
Maybe we should embrace it,

373
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:56,278
live the life that we've
got while we've got it.

374
00:36:56,347 --> 00:37:01,842
And embrace this world and this life

375
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:04,114
and see what that brings us.

376
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:15,830
I've got people that want to
get off the ship, move down here.

377
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:23,967
Can't say as I blame them, I
mean, what are you gonna do?

378
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:28,242
You gonna keep them up
there like prisoners,

379
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:31,577
running around in circles
all night, all day,

380
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:33,378
waiting for the apocalypse?

381
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:39,582
Well, the apocalypse
has happened once before.

382
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:40,851
Yeah.

383
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:45,327
And there was nothing you could do
to stop it, Bill, not then, not now.

384
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:49,162
I mean, let's get real. Let's get real.

385
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:52,833
The Cylons come back, we're dead.

386
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,871
Disease strikes, we're dead.

387
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,204
Earthquake, volcano, hurricane,

388
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:01,211
today, tomorrow, five
years from now and it's...

389
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,540
And you know what I'd say?

390
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:10,143
Life's a bitch and then you die.

391
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:18,257
You know... No, no, I'm serious.

392
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:20,855
I mean, I think that...

393
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:24,533
I think we should all
look at every moment

394
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:27,137
of every day from now
on as borrowed time,

395
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,467
and people should live the lives

396
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:32,769
that they want to live before it's over.

397
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:37,774
Let's stop spending the
little time we have left here

398
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:40,715
worrying about when it's gonna end.

399
00:38:57,635 --> 00:38:59,694
Okay. Okay.

400
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:06,299
Check it out. It's a
great place for a house.

401
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:11,477
So, you're really gonna give up flying?

402
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,675
Flying's gonna suck now anyway.

403
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:17,414
Lots of training, endless caps.

404
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:20,251
War is over. So is all the good stuff.

405
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:24,727
No, don't say that. You'll jinx it.

406
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:26,222
Mmm.

407
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,260
So, what am I standing in
now? Is this the kitchen?

408
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:30,422
Mmm.

409
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,434
Bedroom.

410
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:39,671
No. No, no, no. No thank you.
That is not someplace I wanna go,

411
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:43,339
or think about or imagine
or anything else, okay.

412
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:48,546
That sounds like a
personal problem to me.

413
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:51,982
Just give me a tour of your house, okay?

414
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:55,851
Show me all the great rooms you
and Pyramid-Boy are gonna have,

415
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:58,986
all the great views,
all the cool furniture.

416
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:05,291
Give me a tour of the
future life of Kara Anders.

417
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,336
I'm not getting married.

418
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:15,168
Well, then, what's the point, Kara?

419
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:19,711
I mean, you love him, right?

420
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:29,124
Where are we going with this, Lee?

421
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:33,121
Well, now that's the question, isn't it?

422
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,357
Where are we going?

423
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:39,862
I mean, what if this is it?

424
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:44,704
This, the rest of your life, Kara.

425
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:49,004
Is this how you want to spend it?

426
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:51,273
Who you want to spend it with?

427
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,515
You got someone in mind, Lee?

428
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:12,260
Tell me you're not afraid
that I'm not gonna come along

429
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:17,273
and upset your neat little applecart.

430
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,681
Maybe I want it upset.

431
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:30,678
Well, that makes
things more complicated.

432
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:32,807
Yeah.

433
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,617
What are we gonna do?

434
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:44,256
What are we gonna do?

435
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:51,294
We accept it.

436
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:54,097
Tomorrow I tell Dee, you tell Sam.

437
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:56,767
Just like that?

438
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,135
Just like that.

439
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:02,177
I don't know.

440
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:04,944
You know, we tell them how we feel.

441
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,913
We shout it to the skies.

442
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:08,508
Yeah.

443
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:09,575
Yeah. Yeah, right.

444
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:12,315
What, you don't think I will?

445
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:14,118
Mmm-mmm.

446
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:16,052
Mmm-mmm.

447
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:18,353
Lee!

448
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:28,264
My name is Lee Adama!

449
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:32,605
And I love Kara Thrace!

450
00:43:35,546 --> 00:43:37,036
Come down.

451
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:39,914
What? What, it's not
like anybody will hear,

452
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:42,245
we're in your cabin
in the forest, right?

453
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:46,851
I love Kara Thrace!

454
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:49,721
And I don't care who frakking knows!

455
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:57,100
Oh, you're crazy. Get down.

456
00:43:58,202 --> 00:43:59,794
Well, come on. I'm not going to stop

457
00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:01,564
until you get up and do it, too.

458
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,106
I can't.

459
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:09,569
This is Kara Thrace, scourge of
the Cylon Raiders. She's afraid?

460
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,080
Come on, stand up.

461
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:12,172
No.

462
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,011
I'm gonna... Okay, here we go again.

463
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:15,881
Lee Adama...

464
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,817
Okay, okay, okay. Okay.

465
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:22,518
Okay.

466
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:25,053
Ka...

467
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:32,632
Kara Thrace loves Lee Adama!

468
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:54,687
Are you sure I'm what you want?

469
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:58,251
Yeah, you're what I want.

470
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:02,324
I just don't... I don't
think I really knew it

471
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:05,094
until I said it out loud just now.

472
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,202
Why?

473
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:15,439
Because of Zak?

474
00:45:19,683 --> 00:45:21,776
Yeah, and a lot of things.

475
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:29,483
Mostly because I was afraid

476
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:34,294
to admit how much I needed you.

477
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:37,125
How much I needed anyone.

478
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:40,597
Yeah.

479
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:44,073
I love you, Kara Thrace.

480
00:45:46,977 --> 00:45:48,672
I love you, too.

481
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:09,725
Come on!

482
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:29,514
The old man's got chops.

483
00:46:29,586 --> 00:46:32,851
He knows when to make his
moves, when to hold back.

484
00:46:32,923 --> 00:46:35,653
I wish I could say the same for his son.

485
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:39,656
Why are you two even fighting?

486
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,458
Why not just get a room?

487
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:44,634
Been there, done that.

488
00:46:44,768 --> 00:46:46,736
Guess it just rubbed
us both the wrong way.

489
00:46:54,611 --> 00:46:55,908
Dee,

490
00:46:57,748 --> 00:47:00,774
what she's talking about
was a long time ago.

491
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:03,479
A long time ago. It
didn't mean anything.

492
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:06,046
You said you had something to settle.

493
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:08,215
Settle it.

494
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,659
Tonight.

495
00:47:11,795 --> 00:47:13,228
Listen to me. Listen.

496
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:19,801
And once again, it's just you and me.

497
00:47:22,306 --> 00:47:24,331
You motherfrakker!

498
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:26,533
Hold that thought, okay?

499
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:31,842
Come on, Dad!

500
00:48:57,868 --> 00:49:01,235
That's bad. That's enough
already. You should quit.

501
00:49:01,905 --> 00:49:03,668
Just stop the blood.

502
00:49:06,043 --> 00:49:08,102
Coagulant for the swelling
as for the bleeding.

503
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:09,270
Come on. Christ.

504
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:11,314
You insist on doing this?

505
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:13,416
You wanna do this, you're crazy, right?

506
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:16,579
You wanna do this? Yeah.

507
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:18,644
All right. Keep your guard
up, he's coming in wild,

508
00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:21,486
get him with a left hook. You wanna win?

509
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:24,588
I'm not gonna win.

510
00:49:34,771 --> 00:49:36,636
You gotta watch his jab. Watch his jab.

511
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:37,799
His jab's killing you, all right?

512
00:49:37,874 --> 00:49:38,932
Just keep your eyes open.

513
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:40,408
All right, here you
go. Have some. Open up.

514
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:41,943
Okay, you're looking good.

515
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:43,912
Keep strong, watch his jab. Here we go.

516
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:49,680
Hey.

517
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,545
Wake up. Here.

518
00:49:55,892 --> 00:49:57,450
Want some coffee?

519
00:49:58,628 --> 00:50:00,926
You'll feel better, trust me.

520
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:06,058
Chief, good morning.
Good morning, Kelly.

521
00:50:07,537 --> 00:50:13,498
I've been thinking about what
you said, and you may be right,

522
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:17,944
about what you said.

523
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:21,108
I'm sorry, what?

524
00:50:25,255 --> 00:50:26,847
Oh, right.

525
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,125
About living down here.

526
00:50:31,628 --> 00:50:34,461
A Battlestar's no
place to raise a family.

527
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,362
So I'm gonna miss you, Chief.

528
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:39,298
But I'm gonna wish you good luck.

529
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:51,838
Thank you, sir.

530
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:54,348
My best to both of you.

531
00:50:54,484 --> 00:50:55,883
We're moving? Really?

532
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:57,718
Thank you.

533
00:50:57,788 --> 00:50:59,813
I want you guys to
have at least a dozen.

534
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:02,615
We'll see about that.

535
00:52:14,097 --> 00:52:17,328
Get up. We'll get you up.

536
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:58,441
When you stand on this
deck, you be ready to fight,

537
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:02,307
or you dishonor the
reason why we're here.

538
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:07,245
And remember this.

539
00:53:09,553 --> 00:53:13,512
When you fight a man,
he's not your friend.

540
00:53:19,629 --> 00:53:22,063
The same goes when you lead men.

541
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:24,929
I forgot that once.

542
00:53:28,104 --> 00:53:30,971
I let you get too close. All of you.

543
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:35,469
I dropped my guard.

544
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:46,888
I let this crew, and
this family, disband.

545
00:53:52,596 --> 00:53:54,894
And we paid the price in lives.

546
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:03,397
That can't happen again.

547
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,997
Figurski, you're with me.

548
00:54:30,133 --> 00:54:32,533
Let's get that bird back on the line.

549
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:37,966
Madam President.

550
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:39,234
Admiral.

551
00:54:52,188 --> 00:54:54,748
All right. This dance is over.

552
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:58,191
Get your booze and your dog
tags and let's get out of here.

553
00:54:58,261 --> 00:54:59,888
So what, you're just gonna call it?

554
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:03,364
Not enough excitement for
one night for you, Captain?

555
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,963
Hey. Hey!

556
00:55:12,776 --> 00:55:15,574
Where the frak do you
think you're going?

557
00:55:18,214 --> 00:55:19,306
It's over, Kara.

558
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:20,575
So what?

559
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:22,845
You have the guts to try and frak

560
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:25,216
another man's woman,
but not to fight one?

561
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:29,483
I wonder if Dee knew
what she was getting.

562
00:55:29,726 --> 00:55:32,820
Think she would have
settled for sloppy seconds?

563
00:55:40,704 --> 00:55:42,763
The truth stings, don't it?

564
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:45,569
You want a fight, Captain?

565
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:47,371
You've got it.

566
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,358
Your boyfriend snores.

567
00:56:43,032 --> 00:56:45,125
I'll tell you the secret
to avoid hangovers.

568
00:56:45,268 --> 00:56:47,361
Don't stop drinking.

569
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:22,027
Well, I think that is
the first drink you've

570
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:25,164
ever had with me, Captain Kara Thrace.

571
00:57:25,241 --> 00:57:27,505
Must be a special occasion.

572
00:57:35,852 --> 00:57:37,752
I slept with Lee last night.

573
00:57:56,172 --> 00:57:58,697
Would you stop it? It's not funny.

574
00:58:00,443 --> 00:58:01,774
It's not!

575
00:58:11,921 --> 00:58:13,582
I'm such an idiot.

576
00:58:13,723 --> 00:58:15,384
Well, you said it, I didn't.

577
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:28,493
Hey.

578
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:32,140
Why don't you tell me all about it?

579
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:36,171
I gotta make a move.

580
00:58:38,147 --> 00:58:40,115
One way or the other.

581
00:58:42,285 --> 00:58:44,412
It's combat.

582
00:58:44,554 --> 00:58:46,681
Survival instinct starts to kick in.

583
00:58:46,756 --> 00:58:49,486
Make your choice, don't look back.

584
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:51,550
Survival instinct, huh?

585
00:58:56,132 --> 00:58:57,394
Yeah.

586
00:59:12,582 --> 00:59:16,916
Good morning, Commander.
Ready to go back to our ship?

587
00:59:24,294 --> 00:59:26,854
So much for keeping a lid on things.

588
00:59:28,031 --> 00:59:29,623
What's going on?

589
00:59:29,766 --> 00:59:31,393
Let's get the hell out of here.

590
00:59:47,283 --> 00:59:49,649
What? You afraid to hit me?

591
00:59:57,794 --> 00:59:59,625
Or maybe you can't.

592
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:13,007
Get up! Starbuck, get
up! You can do this.

593
01:00:36,699 --> 01:00:38,564
Good morning, Admiral.

594
01:00:41,704 --> 01:00:44,434
You look like you had a good time.

595
01:00:44,507 --> 01:00:46,498
Yeah, it was some party.

596
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:48,773
Yeah, well, it's been a
hell of a morning, too.

597
01:00:48,911 --> 01:00:50,708
You missed all the excitement.

598
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:52,304
Why? Is it problems upstairs?

599
01:00:52,448 --> 01:00:53,972
No.

600
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:57,144
No, good things. Kara got married.

601
01:00:57,787 --> 01:00:59,550
You believe that?

602
01:00:59,622 --> 01:01:01,021
What?

603
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:02,556
Yeah, about an hour ago.

604
01:01:02,625 --> 01:01:06,493
Found herself a priest, went
down by the river and got married.

605
01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:12,799
You okay?

606
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:31,649
Can you believe that?

607
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:35,981
Well, she deserves that man.

608
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:38,289
We all deserve to be happy.

609
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:42,991
I also gave her permission to muster
out, along with Tyrol and Cally.

610
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,327
A few of the others, so...

611
01:01:45,401 --> 01:01:48,461
We have to ask to make
sure there's no mass exodus.

612
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:13,888
Hey, man. Did you hear the news?

613
01:02:15,765 --> 01:02:17,392
We're hitched. We got married.

614
01:02:17,533 --> 01:02:19,160
Can you believe it?

615
01:02:19,702 --> 01:02:22,102
No. No, I can't believe it.

616
01:02:22,171 --> 01:02:26,301
Yeah. You know, it was crazy. She
comes down and she wakes me up,

617
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:28,536
she pops the question, she
drags me down to the priest,

618
01:02:28,611 --> 01:02:30,442
and bang! Like that. We're married.

619
01:02:33,149 --> 01:02:34,639
So it was your idea.

620
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:40,847
Yeah. It was my idea.

621
01:02:40,957 --> 01:02:47,089
Do you guys want a
minute to, you know, talk?

622
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:49,622
Congratulations, Sam.

623
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:50,790
Yeah.

624
01:02:51,033 --> 01:02:52,466
And good luck.

625
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:56,333
You're gonna need it.

626
01:03:18,761 --> 01:03:21,059
Oops. Did I break the rules?

627
01:03:26,702 --> 01:03:30,365
You've only got one. Protect
yourself at all costs.

628
01:03:41,951 --> 01:03:44,579
You never let anybody get inside.

629
01:03:44,854 --> 01:03:46,219
I made my choice.

630
01:03:46,355 --> 01:03:47,720
You ran away.

631
01:03:48,424 --> 01:03:50,824
Let's go, girl. You can take him!

632
01:03:58,801 --> 01:04:00,996
The truth stings, don't it?

633
01:04:02,605 --> 01:04:05,904
You frakking hypocrite.
What choice did you make?

634
01:04:08,477 --> 01:04:09,842
What's going on?

635
01:04:09,979 --> 01:04:11,344
What's it look like?

636
01:04:12,215 --> 01:04:14,775
Looks like they're
trying to kill each other.

637
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:16,648
From one perspective.

638
01:04:19,889 --> 01:04:22,323
Where is this coming from?

639
01:04:22,491 --> 01:04:26,018
I don't know. I've been
thinking about it for a while.

640
01:04:26,662 --> 01:04:28,823
No, that's a lie.

641
01:04:28,965 --> 01:04:31,126
And I don't wanna start this with a lie.

642
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:35,936
Kara and Anders got
married this morning.

643
01:04:36,005 --> 01:04:38,974
And what, they're having
a two-for-one special?

644
01:04:42,678 --> 01:04:46,944
When Kara said she was
married, it really made me think

645
01:04:49,585 --> 01:04:52,315
about the life I wanna live now.

646
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:54,815
And I want you in that life.

647
01:04:56,592 --> 01:04:58,753
The times we've been together,

648
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:01,056
they're the happiest
I've ever been. Ever.

649
01:05:02,965 --> 01:05:06,093
So, please, Dee, will you marry me?

650
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:09,034
Aren't you forgetting something?

651
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:12,104
You love Kara Thrace.

652
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:16,973
What? No.

653
01:05:17,046 --> 01:05:19,640
The two of you were linked somehow,

654
01:05:19,782 --> 01:05:24,549
and I mean, one day, you're
gonna turn to me and say,

655
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:26,383
"Dee, I'm sorry, but...
" That's not gonna happen.

656
01:05:26,455 --> 01:05:28,320
It will happen. No.

657
01:05:30,793 --> 01:05:32,522
And yes,

658
01:05:34,196 --> 01:05:35,788
I'll marry you.

659
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,690
You will?

660
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:42,169
I've been thinking, too.

661
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:47,703
Maybe we're safe, but
who knows for how long?

662
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:51,474
I wanna live my life like every
moment is gonna be my last.

663
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:55,816
I'll even marry you, Lee Adama.

664
01:05:56,485 --> 01:06:00,046
And I will love you and cherish you

665
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:04,024
until the Cylons come back,

666
01:06:04,527 --> 01:06:07,223
or until Kara Thrace
walks back into your life.

667
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:09,890
Dee, she's not walking back.

668
01:06:10,366 --> 01:06:11,765
I mean...

669
01:06:11,834 --> 01:06:13,301
Just kiss me.

670
01:06:14,036 --> 01:06:16,368
Kiss me before I change my mind.

671
01:06:25,081 --> 01:06:27,276
Let's go! Fight, girl!

672
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:28,339
Let's go!

673
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:36,957
Come on, Lee, kick her ass!

674
01:06:37,026 --> 01:06:38,084
Yeah.

675
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:40,424
Yeah!

676
01:06:43,299 --> 01:06:46,359
You're trying to finish things?

677
01:06:51,774 --> 01:06:53,639
Put him down, baby.

678
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:55,768
Come on.

679
01:07:21,137 --> 01:07:22,661
Let go of me.

680
01:07:24,507 --> 01:07:27,567
Why? So that you can hit me some more?

681
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:31,540
Yeah.

682
01:07:33,482 --> 01:07:36,474
Well, I may not be able to walk anymore.

683
01:07:38,921 --> 01:07:41,151
I think you busted my nose.

684
01:07:42,324 --> 01:07:45,054
How about we call this a tie, huh?

685
01:08:03,012 --> 01:08:04,639
I'm out of here.

686
01:08:17,893 --> 01:08:19,292
I missed you.

687
01:08:25,468 --> 01:08:27,095
I missed you, too.

688
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:30,132
I missed you, too.

689
01:08:39,482 --> 01:08:42,383
I think things just
got more complicated.

690
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:06,172
No, no, not now.
