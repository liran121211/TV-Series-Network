1
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,138
Previously on Battlestar Galactica...

2
00:00:24,245 --> 00:00:28,417
I can't figure it. All those weeks in
detention and suddenly, they let me out.

3
00:00:28,546 --> 00:00:32,206
I want a specific place,
I want a specific time

4
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:36,023
for a very high-level meeting
of the insurgency leadership.

5
00:00:36,199 --> 00:00:39,366
And if I don't get it,
we pick up Saul again.

6
00:00:39,542 --> 00:00:41,044
And this time,

7
00:00:41,184 --> 00:00:43,120
he'll lose more than an eye.

8
00:00:43,225 --> 00:00:45,955
The child's life
must be protected at all costs.

9
00:00:46,131 --> 00:00:48,184
The first cylon-human hybrid.

10
00:00:48,313 --> 00:00:50,365
It truly is a miracle from God.

11
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,697
We lost her. We did the best we could,

12
00:00:53,814 --> 00:00:56,395
but she's dead.
And that's all there is to it.

13
00:00:57,296 --> 00:00:58,751
She's so beautiful.

14
00:00:58,868 --> 00:01:02,469
You understand, Maya, that
this adoption requires absolute secrecy.

15
00:01:02,551 --> 00:01:03,619
You have my word.

16
00:01:03,701 --> 00:01:07,090
There's a Raptor out there every day,
listening for a wireless call.

17
00:01:07,207 --> 00:01:11,454
And it's out there because the old man
isn't just gonna leave us to the Cylons.

18
00:01:11,641 --> 00:01:15,020
Will make contact
this frequency every 12 hours.

19
00:01:15,149 --> 00:01:17,327
Have hope. We're coming for you.

20
00:01:17,421 --> 00:01:20,443
Cylons have removed launch keys
from grounded colonial ships.

21
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:21,547
Location : Unknown.

22
00:01:21,632 --> 00:01:24,043
Best option is for Saul
and the people on the ground

23
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,418
getting their hands
on the original launch keys.

24
00:01:26,547 --> 00:01:29,076
Admiral's decided
to put some boots on the ground.

25
00:01:29,158 --> 00:01:31,698
Wants to send
an officer as a liaison between us

26
00:01:31,768 --> 00:01:34,789
and the resistance elements on
the planet to coordinate the rescue op.

27
00:01:34,988 --> 00:01:38,202
- Makes sense. What's the problem ?
- It's who he's sending.

28
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,886
This entire plan is a reckless gamble.

29
00:01:41,956 --> 00:01:44,959
You are risking
the lives of the entire human race.

30
00:01:45,029 --> 00:01:47,715
You should make plans
to resume the search for Earth

31
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,944
with the Pegasus and the civilian fleet.

32
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,186
But I'm going back.

33
00:01:51,268 --> 00:01:55,104
We round up the leaders of the
insurgency and we execute them publicly.

34
00:01:55,245 --> 00:01:59,092
We round up at random groups off
the street and we execute them publicly.

35
00:01:59,198 --> 00:02:01,720
Send a message
that the gloves are coming off.

36
00:02:01,814 --> 00:02:04,335
The insurgency stops now
or else we start

37
00:02:04,406 --> 00:02:07,785
reducing the human population
to a more manageable size.

38
00:02:21,425 --> 00:02:23,731
Let them
stretch their legs for a minute.

39
00:02:23,848 --> 00:02:27,086
All right. Everybody out !
Five-minute rest break. Come on, move !

40
00:02:33,467 --> 00:02:35,764
You. Over here.

41
00:02:42,216 --> 00:02:43,559
Run.

42
00:02:43,659 --> 00:02:45,822
Run ! Don't look back. Go !

43
00:03:27,702 --> 00:03:29,110
Can I help you ?

44
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:33,286
- Here we go.
- Thanks.

45
00:03:35,554 --> 00:03:38,018
- Sorry.
- That's all right, it doesn't hurt.

46
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,589
I appreciate you doing this. I can't
seem to get it right in the mirror.

47
00:03:42,616 --> 00:03:43,727
Saul.

48
00:03:47,601 --> 00:03:49,525
I want you to know

49
00:03:50,686 --> 00:03:53,384
that I would do anything for you.

50
00:03:54,983 --> 00:03:56,544
Yeah.

51
00:03:59,324 --> 00:04:01,423
The list, Cally's on the list.

52
00:04:01,494 --> 00:04:03,148
- They're gonna kill her.
- What list ?

53
00:04:03,242 --> 00:04:05,705
- What are you talking about ?
- I got this.

54
00:04:06,235 --> 00:04:09,120
I got this from the dead-drop.
From the source in the administration.

55
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,443
It's a death list
and Cally's name is on it.

56
00:04:16,154 --> 00:04:18,195
They're rounding up people in the city.

57
00:04:18,787 --> 00:04:21,379
Cally's in detention. They could
take her out at any minute...

58
00:04:21,438 --> 00:04:23,497
They got this
organized by transport vehicles.

59
00:04:23,591 --> 00:04:27,028
Cally's in the group heading
for map coordinate x-ray seven.

60
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,010
I know, but where the frak is that ?

61
00:04:29,116 --> 00:04:31,743
- I mean, how are we gonna...
- Calm down, damnit.

62
00:04:32,283 --> 00:04:34,922
You gotta start thinking
clearly here, Chief, or she's dead.

63
00:04:35,004 --> 00:04:37,880
Now we've already figured out
their map coordinate system.

64
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:41,786
It's referred to in the list of cylon
freqs you got from the last dead-drop.

65
00:04:42,712 --> 00:04:44,789
Holy frak ! You're right.

66
00:04:44,882 --> 00:04:48,200
- I can extrapolate the coordinates...
- Cally's group has to pick up

67
00:04:48,272 --> 00:04:50,477
a bunch of people in town first.
That'll take time.

68
00:04:50,664 --> 00:04:53,714
Take four men and get out there
ahead of the trucks.

69
00:04:54,922 --> 00:04:56,271
Chief !

70
00:04:56,424 --> 00:04:59,837
Pull it together. You won't do her
any good if you get caught too.

71
00:05:00,528 --> 00:05:01,678
Besides,

72
00:05:01,783 --> 00:05:05,033
the last thing your son wants
is me and Ellen for parents.

73
00:05:07,343 --> 00:05:09,279
Find that list, Chief.

{\a6}Come on...

83
00:06:16,272 --> 00:06:19,240
{\a6}Damnit ! Gods damnit !
Where's that frakkin' list ?

84
00:06:19,578 --> 00:06:22,288
{\a6}It's gotta be here.

85
00:06:34,888 --> 00:06:36,425
Frak ! Come on !

86
00:06:40,201 --> 00:06:43,435
{\a6}Here it is. Okay.
X-ray seven. 1, 4, 3...

87
00:06:45,136 --> 00:06:46,543
{\a6}Hey, Chief.

88
00:06:47,294 --> 00:06:49,570
{\a6}Good day for a walk, huh ?

89
00:06:50,332 --> 00:06:52,871
{\a6}Get your men together.
We're going to Pergamus' flats.

90
00:07:19,114 --> 00:07:21,125
- Talk to me, Gunny.
- Don't like it, Lt.

91
00:07:21,221 --> 00:07:23,110
Too much cover along this trail.

92
00:07:23,179 --> 00:07:25,799
We could catch
enfilade fire from there,

93
00:07:25,868 --> 00:07:28,515
there, and along there.

94
00:07:30,318 --> 00:07:33,117
Let's move out.
I'm going to the rendezvous point.

95
00:07:33,185 --> 00:07:35,805
Place your men on the ridge for cover.

96
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,562
{\a6}Go panthers !

97
00:08:04,437 --> 00:08:06,422
C-bucks rule !

98
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:31,212
Hey, Sam. It's been a while.

99
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,489
Funny, I feel like I see you every day.

100
00:08:36,366 --> 00:08:37,728
Come on.

101
00:08:47,105 --> 00:08:48,973
{\a6}There's trucks.

102
00:08:52,247 --> 00:08:54,660
{\a6}Move down to the ridge.
Move down to the ridge.

103
00:08:55,815 --> 00:08:57,543
{\a6}Crispin, you here.

104
00:08:59,324 --> 00:09:01,184
This is it, lock and load.

105
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:11,270
{\a6}All right. What do we see ?

106
00:09:15,561 --> 00:09:17,251
Oh, frak me.

107
00:09:17,445 --> 00:09:19,495
- What ?
- They got Laura Roslin

108
00:09:19,561 --> 00:09:20,928
and Tom Zarek with them.

109
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,957
Is there any sign of Cally ?

110
00:09:24,362 --> 00:09:25,470
Not yet.

111
00:09:25,545 --> 00:09:28,224
So Galactica's got a rescue plan
in place and ready to go.

112
00:09:28,422 --> 00:09:31,451
My job's to get the launch keys
for the ships still on the ground,

113
00:09:31,498 --> 00:09:34,195
then coordinate the rescue mission
with your evacuation plan.

114
00:09:34,278 --> 00:09:35,761
When can we meet with Colonel Tigh ?

115
00:09:35,805 --> 00:09:38,680
We're gonna wait until nightfall
before we head back into the city.

116
00:09:40,209 --> 00:09:41,334
There she is.

117
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:43,618
There she is.

118
00:09:45,135 --> 00:09:46,976
Oh, my Gods, there she is.

119
00:09:50,593 --> 00:09:52,230
What the frak's she doing ?

120
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:54,447
She's making a run for it.

121
00:09:55,884 --> 00:09:57,753
The bullet heads are lining up.

122
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:00,612
It's a firing squad.

123
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,336
Sight in on the Centurions right now !

124
00:10:07,045 --> 00:10:10,028
Cally's right in our line of fire.
If we shoot, we're gonna hit her.

125
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:13,849
Count to five. Open fire.

126
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:19,353
Two skinjobs, should we take 'em down ?

127
00:10:19,397 --> 00:10:22,593
Where there are skinjobs, there are
bullet heads, bring up the RPG.

128
00:10:26,812 --> 00:10:30,611
There's a system of tunnels we've been
using that run parallel and under...

129
00:10:31,113 --> 00:10:32,187
Do you hear that ?

130
00:10:35,054 --> 00:10:36,148
Go ! Go ! Go !

131
00:10:36,223 --> 00:10:37,359
Get back !

132
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,585
Get down !

133
00:10:41,024 --> 00:10:42,254
Go ! Go ! Go !

134
00:10:43,964 --> 00:10:45,106
Thousand one...

135
00:10:46,862 --> 00:10:47,868
Thousand two...

136
00:10:49,521 --> 00:10:50,765
Thousand three...

137
00:10:53,469 --> 00:10:54,628
Thousand four...

138
00:10:56,503 --> 00:10:57,696
Thousand five.

139
00:11:07,921 --> 00:11:09,852
Frak this, we gotta get out of here.

140
00:11:09,965 --> 00:11:11,946
Stay put. Trust me.

141
00:11:12,068 --> 00:11:13,167
Now !

142
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:20,631
Thanks.

143
00:12:00,836 --> 00:12:03,466
They were waiting for us, Lt.
Right where we thought.

144
00:12:03,695 --> 00:12:04,470
Sir,

145
00:12:05,469 --> 00:12:06,942
you better take a look at this.

146
00:12:08,012 --> 00:12:09,802
I found it on a dead skinjob.

147
00:12:10,236 --> 00:12:12,208
It's your handwriting, isn't it ?

148
00:12:12,574 --> 00:12:14,449
Yeah, damn right it is.

149
00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:17,926
We were sold out.

150
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:19,890
Ellen.

151
00:12:23,658 --> 00:12:25,629
Check them up, make sure they're okay.

152
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:35,586
- You all right, Tom ?
- Yeah.

153
00:12:36,268 --> 00:12:38,869
Been a while since I had a woman
throw me to the ground.

154
00:12:39,398 --> 00:12:41,256
Not quite as much fun as I remember.

155
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,779
Hurts, huh ? Good.

156
00:12:53,042 --> 00:12:56,728
Then I hope it hurts a long,
long time till you go to Download City.

157
00:13:09,076 --> 00:13:10,372
You're all right down there ?

158
00:13:10,491 --> 00:13:12,308
Oh, my Gods.

159
00:13:13,525 --> 00:13:15,247
It's good to see you, Chief.

160
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,761
Good to see you too, ma'am.

161
00:13:19,638 --> 00:13:21,757
What happens now ?
Where do we go from here ?

162
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:22,996
We're going home.

163
00:13:23,372 --> 00:13:24,799
We're going home.

164
00:13:25,069 --> 00:13:26,705
Admiral Adama's on his way.

165
00:13:27,114 --> 00:13:29,681
We're getting off this rock.
We're going back to Galactica.

166
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:38,572
Don't worry about it, Gaius.

167
00:14:38,984 --> 00:14:40,647
It's all right.

168
00:14:41,132 --> 00:14:44,330
- It doesn't matter to me, really.
- You can stop that right now, okay ?

169
00:14:45,182 --> 00:14:47,824
My ego's not so fragile as all that.

170
00:14:51,359 --> 00:14:52,637
These things happen.

171
00:14:53,353 --> 00:14:54,689
Or they don't happen.

172
00:15:03,216 --> 00:15:05,177
So what should we talk about ?

173
00:15:06,642 --> 00:15:08,381
Should we talk about your day ?

174
00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:12,027
How was your day, darling ?

175
00:15:13,761 --> 00:15:15,807
How was your day at the office ?

176
00:15:19,892 --> 00:15:21,240
My office.

177
00:15:22,772 --> 00:15:24,217
Any news ?

178
00:15:26,931 --> 00:15:27,922
No ?

179
00:15:29,498 --> 00:15:32,038
Well, let me tell you
about my day because

180
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,903
it was a hoot.

181
00:15:38,928 --> 00:15:41,690
I had the most fascinating chat
with one of the Dorals.

182
00:15:42,113 --> 00:15:44,051
He's got this theory

183
00:15:44,892 --> 00:15:47,187
about sanitation being the key

184
00:15:47,276 --> 00:15:49,939
to regaining human trust and confidence.

185
00:15:50,005 --> 00:15:51,357
Something about...

186
00:15:53,015 --> 00:15:54,437
toilet paper.

187
00:15:55,046 --> 00:15:57,821
No, lack of toilet paper, that's it.

188
00:15:58,352 --> 00:16:00,563
If people could only wipe
their bums properly,

189
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,106
there'd be
a measurable uptick in the polls.

190
00:16:05,572 --> 00:16:07,535
Four months of this, Gaius.

191
00:16:08,987 --> 00:16:13,590
Four months of watching you slip
further and further down into this

192
00:16:14,369 --> 00:16:17,753
well of self-hatred and loathing.

193
00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:20,698
Do you know what I've given up for you ?

194
00:16:21,652 --> 00:16:23,145
Do you ?

195
00:16:25,602 --> 00:16:28,411
Do you know what,
with the occupation and everything,

196
00:16:29,426 --> 00:16:32,581
I can't really say I've given it
that much thought recently.

197
00:16:43,844 --> 00:16:45,022
Don't go.

198
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:48,649
Please.

199
00:17:26,018 --> 00:17:28,340
That doesn't look so bad.

200
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:36,457
There's something that
I wanted to say to you.

201
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,479
I'm sorry that I left you alone.

202
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:46,608
I didn't mean for you to get hurt.

203
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:51,154
I was upset with myself.

204
00:17:51,423 --> 00:17:53,857
And not you, okay ?

205
00:17:57,953 --> 00:17:59,526
Grown-ups

206
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:02,617
do stupid things sometimes.

207
00:18:02,921 --> 00:18:05,311
We get caught up in our

208
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,935
own little world until
it's almost too late.

209
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:17,264
You have no idea
what I'm saying to you, do you ?

210
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:23,437
Okay.
Time to take a nap.

211
00:19:32,915 --> 00:19:36,593
Don't be afraid.
I know who you are, what you are.

212
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:39,054
Poor thing.

213
00:19:40,973 --> 00:19:42,850
You must be terrified.

214
00:19:57,105 --> 00:19:58,657
Do you have any candy ?

215
00:20:00,082 --> 00:20:01,201
Candy ?

216
00:20:02,918 --> 00:20:04,044
No.

217
00:20:06,453 --> 00:20:08,208
Chamalla's so bitter.

218
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:15,591
Zeus sees all.

219
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:18,927
Sees you, number three.
Sees your pain.

220
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:21,054
Your destiny.

221
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:25,684
All the Gods weep for you.

222
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:27,644
There is no Zeus.

223
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:29,688
No other god but God.

224
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:33,400
Well, you don't believe that anymore.

225
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:37,696
You don't know what you believe
and that is why you're here.

226
00:20:38,774 --> 00:20:40,449
It's not true.

227
00:20:41,116 --> 00:20:42,993
I don't even know why I'm here.

228
00:20:43,065 --> 00:20:46,240
- That's the stupidest thing I ever did.
- It is your dream

229
00:20:46,586 --> 00:20:48,905
that brings you to me.

230
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,627
How do you know about that ?

231
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:59,965
I have a message for you
from the one you worship.

232
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,809
He speaks through me to you

233
00:21:02,959 --> 00:21:05,974
just as he speaks in your dreams.
The message is...

234
00:21:08,931 --> 00:21:11,243
the fruit born of two peoples

235
00:21:12,389 --> 00:21:14,022
is alive.

236
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,536
A child named after

237
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:21,615
the wife and sister
of the all-knowing Zeus.

238
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:24,766
Hera lives.

239
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:27,079
That's not true.

240
00:21:27,723 --> 00:21:29,029
The child is dead.

241
00:21:29,536 --> 00:21:31,160
You will hold her in your arms,

242
00:21:31,226 --> 00:21:33,181
and you'll know for the first time

243
00:21:33,224 --> 00:21:37,206
what it is to feel true love.

244
00:21:38,215 --> 00:21:41,176
But you'll lose everything
you've done here.

245
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:52,636
Wish I had some chocolate caramels.

246
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:07,119
Let's move ! We got some people
waiting for their ride down there.

247
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:15,002
Will you quit looking at me like that ?

248
00:22:15,544 --> 00:22:17,027
Like what ?

249
00:22:17,713 --> 00:22:19,173
You know like what.

250
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:22,009
Like we're never
gonna see each other again.

251
00:22:23,635 --> 00:22:26,513
We will.
It's a good plan, D.

252
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:29,349
Take care of the Admiral ?

253
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:32,769
Take care of his son.

254
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:37,816
All right people,
you know how this works :

255
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:41,486
Pegasus crew on the port side
of the line, Galactica on the right.

256
00:23:08,189 --> 00:23:10,557
Their enemies will divide them.

257
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:14,436
Their colonies broken
in the fiery chasm of space.

258
00:23:16,647 --> 00:23:20,607
Their shining days renounced
by a multitude of dark sacrifices.

259
00:23:22,361 --> 00:23:24,342
Yet still they will remain

260
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:26,838
always together.

261
00:23:27,214 --> 00:23:29,117
Always together.

262
00:24:00,276 --> 00:24:03,443
That's the third time
you've taken a look at your watch.

263
00:24:03,891 --> 00:24:05,529
Got dinner plans ?

264
00:24:07,114 --> 00:24:09,172
No, I was just...

265
00:24:10,214 --> 00:24:13,453
I was just thinking
Sharon's probably on the ground by now.

266
00:24:13,811 --> 00:24:15,289
I know.

267
00:24:17,124 --> 00:24:18,834
These are your orders.

268
00:24:19,347 --> 00:24:22,212
You'll find the rendezvous point there.

269
00:24:22,254 --> 00:24:24,131
Take the civilian fleet

270
00:24:24,314 --> 00:24:26,049
and wait for me for 18 hours.

271
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:27,968
If I'm not back in 18 hours,

272
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:29,469
then find Earth.

273
00:24:29,877 --> 00:24:31,138
Yeah, right.

274
00:24:34,922 --> 00:24:37,394
I'll see you at the rendezvous point.

275
00:24:39,188 --> 00:24:40,647
18 hours.

276
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:42,816
- Try not to be late.
- I'm getting old.

277
00:24:42,858 --> 00:24:46,320
I'm a little slow. But I'll be there.

278
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:52,242
Gods, I wish I could
talk you out of this.

279
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:55,871
You can't. You tried.

280
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:01,251
- You know, dad...
- Don't.

281
00:25:03,879 --> 00:25:07,716
Don't make me cry
in my own hangar deck.

282
00:25:19,221 --> 00:25:20,729
I'll see you there.

283
00:25:23,052 --> 00:25:25,888
Permission to leave
your ship, Admiral.

284
00:25:27,111 --> 00:25:28,922
Permission granted, Commander.

285
00:25:33,236 --> 00:25:34,392
Attention !

286
00:25:36,504 --> 00:25:38,415
Commander of Pegasus,

287
00:25:38,468 --> 00:25:39,537
departing.

288
00:25:52,622 --> 00:25:53,823
18 hours.

289
00:26:21,469 --> 00:26:23,059
Hey. Hey !

290
00:26:24,278 --> 00:26:26,055
Hey, Jake.

291
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:31,368
Yeah, you don't care who I am, do ya ?

292
00:26:31,809 --> 00:26:33,613
All God's creatures in your eyes.

293
00:26:34,314 --> 00:26:35,330
Here ya go.

294
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,045
Can't sleep ?

295
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,686
Bad dreams.

296
00:26:45,956 --> 00:26:47,922
Didn't know you people had dreams.

297
00:26:48,522 --> 00:26:49,470
Sure.

298
00:26:50,967 --> 00:26:52,768
Everybody dreams, Doc.

299
00:26:56,542 --> 00:26:58,547
That human or cylon blood ?

300
00:26:58,774 --> 00:26:59,736
Cylon.

301
00:27:00,858 --> 00:27:04,525
One of the fives got pretty shot up
today by the insurgents.

302
00:27:04,846 --> 00:27:06,246
He's gonna make it.

303
00:27:08,561 --> 00:27:10,269
You could've let him suffer.

304
00:27:11,049 --> 00:27:12,880
That's not what I do.

305
00:27:14,419 --> 00:27:15,616
What about the baby ?

306
00:27:17,757 --> 00:27:19,639
Sharon's baby, Hera.

307
00:27:21,229 --> 00:27:23,554
When that child died on Galactica,

308
00:27:23,955 --> 00:27:25,679
why'd you cremate the body ?

309
00:27:27,797 --> 00:27:30,109
It's the first cylon-human hybrid,

310
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,592
and you threw it in the incinerator ?

311
00:27:34,997 --> 00:27:36,895
It wasn't my decision.

312
00:27:37,002 --> 00:27:38,993
That was the President's call.

313
00:27:39,193 --> 00:27:40,867
I was just following orders.

314
00:27:50,238 --> 00:27:52,058
That's a very funny thing.

315
00:27:55,655 --> 00:27:58,341
'Cause this stuff all looks the same.

316
00:28:17,116 --> 00:28:18,176
She said,

317
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:23,411
"I hope it hurts you for a long, long
time before you go to Download City."

318
00:28:27,055 --> 00:28:28,737
And then they just left me there.

319
00:28:29,783 --> 00:28:31,632
They left me in the hot sun

320
00:28:31,894 --> 00:28:33,796
with a bullet in my guts.

321
00:28:34,111 --> 00:28:36,005
What a noble race you are.

322
00:28:40,897 --> 00:28:43,030
How long were you there
before you died ?

323
00:28:43,258 --> 00:28:44,530
Hours.

324
00:28:45,041 --> 00:28:49,042
Eventually, I managed to drag myself
over to some spent shell casings.

325
00:28:49,435 --> 00:28:52,675
And I used one of those
to scratch open my carotid artery.

326
00:28:53,826 --> 00:28:56,184
Skin is a lot tougher than you think.

327
00:28:56,832 --> 00:28:58,291
Now that's...

328
00:28:58,333 --> 00:28:59,658
three for me.

329
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:00,773
Three downloads.

330
00:29:00,825 --> 00:29:02,522
The first one, I just got a headache.

331
00:29:02,565 --> 00:29:04,952
But I could handle it.
Now it's worse and worse.

332
00:29:04,983 --> 00:29:09,042
This time it was like a frakkin'
white hot poker through my skull.

333
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:12,154
Not worth it.

334
00:29:12,806 --> 00:29:14,280
None of this is worth it.

335
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,656
He's right, you know.

336
00:29:17,056 --> 00:29:18,479
It's not worth it.

337
00:29:19,191 --> 00:29:21,541
Which is what I believe
I've been telling you all along.

338
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:25,044
- Caprica, can you please control him ?
- Why don't you just shoot me...

339
00:29:26,492 --> 00:29:28,099
if that'll remedy the situation ?

340
00:29:28,649 --> 00:29:31,157
- We need to crack down harder.
- How ?

341
00:29:31,429 --> 00:29:33,653
Our resources are stretched
to the max already.

342
00:29:33,706 --> 00:29:36,089
I don't need to listen to this anymore.

343
00:29:36,604 --> 00:29:40,131
Consensus used to be so easy.
Now look what they've done to us.

344
00:29:41,129 --> 00:29:42,532
Don't lose hope.

345
00:29:42,676 --> 00:29:46,228
Worst comes to worst, we can always
nuke the city and be done with it.

346
00:30:00,777 --> 00:30:02,699
Better leave those dog tags here.

347
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:04,462
They spot 'em, they'll know who you are.

348
00:30:04,528 --> 00:30:07,122
No, you have no idea
how hard I worked for these.

349
00:30:08,102 --> 00:30:11,584
So our best guess puts the launch keys
somewhere in the detention center.

350
00:30:11,702 --> 00:30:13,309
Just keep to the main streets.

351
00:30:13,387 --> 00:30:16,718
Everybody'll think you're just a regular
skinjob and they'll avoid you but

352
00:30:16,823 --> 00:30:19,898
there's a lot of people out there
looking to gut an unwary cylon going

353
00:30:19,941 --> 00:30:23,213
for a stroll, so don't let anybody get
close enough to stick a knife in you.

354
00:30:23,297 --> 00:30:26,481
All right. Thanks for the concern. It
makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.

355
00:30:26,523 --> 00:30:28,433
How are you gonna find
those launch keys ?

356
00:30:28,549 --> 00:30:31,694
When I get inside and hook into the
data stream, it'll feed me the location.

357
00:30:31,725 --> 00:30:34,264
Once I get the keys, you need
to distribute them to the pilots

358
00:30:34,316 --> 00:30:37,116
- who can fly those ships out of here.
- We got pilots standing by.

359
00:30:37,191 --> 00:30:38,163
Anders !

360
00:30:39,191 --> 00:30:40,141
Yeah, come in.

361
00:30:41,945 --> 00:30:44,043
My Gods ! What's she doing here ?

362
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:47,676
Get her down below and keep her there
until after the next briefing.

363
00:30:48,875 --> 00:30:49,833
Wait a minute !

364
00:30:50,489 --> 00:30:52,279
No, no. Wait, listen to me. Please.

365
00:30:52,341 --> 00:30:55,089
- I can explain.
- I suggest you keep your mouth shut.

366
00:30:57,302 --> 00:30:59,591
Where is my husband ?
I want to speak to my husband.

367
00:30:59,689 --> 00:31:01,119
Connor, let's go, get her down.

368
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:07,058
Okay, I'm outta here.

369
00:31:07,124 --> 00:31:08,580
- Wait, Sharon.
- Yeah.

370
00:31:10,954 --> 00:31:14,643
Do me a favor.
Just keep an eye out for Starbuck.

371
00:31:14,945 --> 00:31:17,688
I don't know if she's alive
or if she's dead but

372
00:31:18,023 --> 00:31:19,365
it's been four months.

373
00:31:20,403 --> 00:31:21,872
I'll do what I can.

374
00:31:23,859 --> 00:31:24,724
Yeah.

375
00:31:37,193 --> 00:31:39,868
You must keep the child
hidden at all costs.

376
00:31:40,143 --> 00:31:41,513
We keep her on the move

377
00:31:41,618 --> 00:31:43,978
along with other high-value targets.

378
00:31:44,491 --> 00:31:48,241
She'll never stay in any one location
longer than two or three days.

379
00:31:49,553 --> 00:31:52,175
Sam, I need you
to really hear me on this.

380
00:31:52,628 --> 00:31:53,914
Really.

381
00:31:54,451 --> 00:31:56,799
There is no one, no one

382
00:31:57,009 --> 00:31:59,737
of higher value than Maya and her child.

383
00:31:59,868 --> 00:32:02,635
We cannot let them fall
into Cylon hands.

384
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:05,172
I get it.

385
00:32:10,308 --> 00:32:12,267
How far do you want me to go ?

386
00:32:13,506 --> 00:32:16,680
I mean, if it looks like the cylons
are gonna capture them...

387
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:21,152
Don't let it get to that point.
That's all.

388
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:25,917
I don't suppose you're gonna
tell me what this is all about.

389
00:32:25,946 --> 00:32:28,265
What's so important about this kid ?

390
00:32:32,403 --> 00:32:35,373
She may very well be
the shape of things to come.

391
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:38,559
That's either a blessing or a curse.

392
00:33:20,793 --> 00:33:23,352
We've stored arms and munitions
in key areas through the city.

393
00:33:23,393 --> 00:33:25,658
I can supplement that
with mortars, RPGs,

394
00:33:25,695 --> 00:33:28,938
even a few anti-aircraft
missiles aboard the Raptor.

395
00:33:29,155 --> 00:33:29,946
Great.

396
00:33:29,999 --> 00:33:32,721
When we give the signal,
our people are gonna attack the airbase,

397
00:33:32,751 --> 00:33:35,455
the detention center, the power station,
other critical facilities.

398
00:33:35,492 --> 00:33:37,448
The plan is to sow
as much chaos and confusion

399
00:33:37,449 --> 00:33:39,674
as possible the moment
Galactica and Pegasus arrive.

400
00:33:39,787 --> 00:33:41,812
- Should help cover the evacuation.
- No pegasus.

401
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:43,075
Just Galactica.

402
00:33:43,196 --> 00:33:44,530
Why ? Why no Pegasus ?

403
00:33:44,553 --> 00:33:46,235
- What happened ?
- Don't know, sir.

404
00:33:46,276 --> 00:33:47,784
Way beyond my pay grade.

405
00:33:48,123 --> 00:33:49,773
What about your evac plans ?

406
00:33:50,009 --> 00:33:52,063
We've designated and
assigned 500 block captains

407
00:33:52,091 --> 00:33:53,598
to cover each sector of the city.

408
00:33:53,617 --> 00:33:55,549
Each block captain
is responsible for rallying

409
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,312
and guiding the people
in his or her sector

410
00:33:57,313 --> 00:33:59,339
along their escape route
to their designated ship.

411
00:33:59,367 --> 00:34:02,053
Don't suppose you've been
able to rehearse any of this.

412
00:34:02,241 --> 00:34:04,626
We've had three full-dress
rehearsals under the guise

413
00:34:04,654 --> 00:34:06,558
of fire and natural disaster drills.

414
00:34:06,596 --> 00:34:08,208
Be different when the balloon goes up.

415
00:34:08,236 --> 00:34:09,886
Explosions, shooting, chaos.

416
00:34:09,905 --> 00:34:11,509
There's gonna be some panic out there.

417
00:34:11,547 --> 00:34:13,856
They'll do fine.
These people know that at some point,

418
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,213
they're gonna be responsible
for saving themselves.

419
00:34:16,241 --> 00:34:18,725
All we need to do
is be ready and hope for the best.

420
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,565
- What about Maya and Isis ?
- I'm on it.

421
00:34:24,763 --> 00:34:26,290
I've got my two best shooters here.

422
00:34:26,309 --> 00:34:29,306
They're gonna be their escorts
and make sure they get back to the ship.

423
00:34:32,425 --> 00:34:34,829
Gentlemen, I can't tell you why,
but it is imperative

424
00:34:34,942 --> 00:34:37,148
that this woman and her child...

425
00:34:37,403 --> 00:34:38,817
... get off this planet.

426
00:34:38,845 --> 00:34:40,872
I trust you because I trust him.

427
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:42,117
Yes, Ma'am.

428
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:44,059
Saul !

429
00:34:45,237 --> 00:34:46,661
We need to talk.

430
00:35:03,503 --> 00:35:04,663
Toaster !

431
00:35:12,828 --> 00:35:14,893
- She sold us out.
- What are you talking about ?

432
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:16,476
We were ambushed
at the rendezvous.

433
00:35:16,492 --> 00:35:18,494
The Cylons knew exactly
where we were gonna be.

434
00:35:18,535 --> 00:35:19,984
It doesn't mean Ellen had...

435
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:22,358
This is the map, Colonel !
The map that I drew for you.

436
00:35:22,367 --> 00:35:23,875
I gave this to you in your tent.

437
00:35:23,894 --> 00:35:26,637
You were gonna burn it but then
your wife offered to do it for you.

438
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:30,106
I got it off a dead skinjob
at the ambush. Do the math !

439
00:35:31,832 --> 00:35:32,888
I...

440
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,636
I want to explain, Saul.

441
00:35:35,743 --> 00:35:38,347
- Godsdamn traitor !
- Shut your frakkin' mouth !

442
00:35:41,314 --> 00:35:42,558
He said...

443
00:35:42,804 --> 00:35:44,019
He said he'd kill you.

444
00:35:44,104 --> 00:35:47,396
- Who said it ?
- One of the brother Cavils.

445
00:35:48,769 --> 00:35:50,957
I did it for you... Saul.

446
00:35:52,154 --> 00:35:54,029
It was all for you, I had to.

447
00:35:54,321 --> 00:35:56,423
I didn't have any choice.

448
00:35:57,093 --> 00:35:58,639
Don't you see that ?

449
00:36:54,073 --> 00:36:55,632
Drawer 3-7-8.

450
00:37:03,963 --> 00:37:05,650
What are you doing ?

451
00:37:06,753 --> 00:37:08,356
Oh, my God, it's you.

452
00:37:13,192 --> 00:37:15,304
You're betraying your own people.

453
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,802
For what ?

454
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:21,366
- I'm a colonial officer now.
- You're not one of them.

455
00:37:22,015 --> 00:37:24,975
- I gave them my word.
- That's not what counts.

456
00:37:25,616 --> 00:37:27,401
It's who you give it to.

457
00:37:27,492 --> 00:37:29,141
I'm gonna have to shoot you now.

458
00:37:29,924 --> 00:37:31,513
Hera lives.

459
00:37:32,515 --> 00:37:33,524
What ?

460
00:37:34,108 --> 00:37:36,130
Your daughter Hera is alive.

461
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,850
Your new friends tell you that ?

462
00:37:51,628 --> 00:37:53,965
They faked her death,
and they hid her from you.

463
00:37:54,032 --> 00:37:56,860
Can't say anything on higher dreams.

464
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,193
I had strange dreams.

465
00:37:59,598 --> 00:38:03,369
I was having strange dreams
that made me question my faith.

466
00:38:03,765 --> 00:38:05,285
Made me question God.

467
00:38:06,094 --> 00:38:08,299
And in the dreams,
there was a human oracle,

468
00:38:08,318 --> 00:38:10,495
so I went to see Dodona Selloi.

469
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:14,171
I'm not gonna kill you but I'm gonna
wound you so you can't warn the others.

470
00:38:14,218 --> 00:38:16,866
The oracle said that the fruit
born of two peoples...

471
00:38:17,131 --> 00:38:18,715
... is still alive.

472
00:38:19,271 --> 00:38:20,477
That Hera lives

473
00:38:20,515 --> 00:38:23,662
and I would hold her in my arms
and I will know true love.

474
00:38:27,066 --> 00:38:28,659
Put down the gun.

475
00:38:29,536 --> 00:38:32,033
And when I find her,
you can hold her too.

476
00:38:43,735 --> 00:38:45,460
Adama wouldn't lie to me.

477
00:38:46,592 --> 00:38:47,893
You're wrong.

478
00:38:47,987 --> 00:38:49,731
You're wrong !

479
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,230
Launch keys don't seem
to have been damaged.

480
00:39:03,589 --> 00:39:04,721
From all the data points,

481
00:39:04,749 --> 00:39:07,943
it looks like the ships all have
enough tylium to make at least one jump.

482
00:39:07,981 --> 00:39:09,518
Congratulations, by the way.

483
00:39:10,037 --> 00:39:11,677
I heard it's a boy.

484
00:39:13,035 --> 00:39:14,335
What's his name ?

485
00:39:15,636 --> 00:39:17,900
Nicolas,
after Cally's grandfather.

486
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:20,611
Hey, Chief...

487
00:39:22,707 --> 00:39:25,199
you remember when you helped
Helo spread Hera's ashes ?

488
00:39:26,808 --> 00:39:28,494
You actually saw the ashes ?

489
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:30,918
Yeah, of course, why ?

490
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:32,925
Nothing.

491
00:39:35,282 --> 00:39:37,949
Just make sure Cally never lets
her kid out of her sight.

492
00:40:02,696 --> 00:40:03,705
Sir ?

493
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:08,587
Listening Raptor just jumped back.

494
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:13,725
Sharon's got the launch keys.

495
00:40:36,455 --> 00:40:37,907
Rec room, Racetrack.

496
00:40:42,253 --> 00:40:43,732
Very well, sir.

497
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:47,795
It's on.

498
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:17,967
This is the Admiral.

499
00:41:19,133 --> 00:41:20,492
You've heard the news.

500
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:22,699
You know the mission.

501
00:41:24,744 --> 00:41:28,148
You should also know there's only
one way that this mission ends.

502
00:41:28,813 --> 00:41:30,854
And that's with the successful rescue

503
00:41:31,109 --> 00:41:32,514
of our people

504
00:41:33,626 --> 00:41:35,266
off of New Caprica.

505
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:37,623
Look around you.

506
00:41:39,173 --> 00:41:41,411
Take a good look at
the men and women...

507
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:45,059
that stand next to you.

508
00:41:47,978 --> 00:41:49,536
Remember their faces.

509
00:41:50,988 --> 00:41:52,798
For one day
you will tell your children

510
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:54,674
and your grandchildren,

511
00:41:55,333 --> 00:41:57,812
that you served with
such men and women

512
00:41:58,425 --> 00:42:00,812
as the universe has never seen.

513
00:42:02,881 --> 00:42:04,278
And together...

514
00:42:04,665 --> 00:42:06,664
you accomplished a feat

515
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:08,728
that will be told and retold

516
00:42:08,983 --> 00:42:10,736
down through the ages.

517
00:42:12,675 --> 00:42:14,817
and find immortality

518
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:18,221
as only the Gods once knew.

519
00:42:20,535 --> 00:42:22,334
I'm proud to serve with you.

520
00:42:23,336 --> 00:42:24,793
Good hunting.

521
00:42:26,785 --> 00:42:28,190
Begin jump prep.

522
00:42:28,718 --> 00:42:29,868
Action stations.

523
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:32,281
Set condition one
