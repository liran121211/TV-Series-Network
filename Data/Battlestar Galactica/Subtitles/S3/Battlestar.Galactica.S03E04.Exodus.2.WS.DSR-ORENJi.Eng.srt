Battlestar Galactica

2
00:00:23,804 --> 00:00:25,341
I have a message for you.

3
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:28,379
"The fruit born of two peoples

4
00:00:28,931 --> 00:00:30,272
is alive."

5
00:00:30,354 --> 00:00:33,674
A child named after

6
00:00:33,885 --> 00:00:37,228
the wife and sister
of the all-knowing Zeus.

7
00:00:37,322 --> 00:00:40,195
Hera... lives.

8
00:00:40,519 --> 00:00:42,083
It's not true.

9
00:00:42,246 --> 00:00:44,651
I don't suppose you will
tell me what this is all about.

10
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,889
I mean,
what's so important about this kid ?

11
00:00:46,994 --> 00:00:50,091
She may very well be
"the shape of things to come".

12
00:00:50,326 --> 00:00:52,449
The Cylons knew exactly
where we were gonna be.

13
00:00:52,543 --> 00:00:55,006
- That doesn't mean Ellen...
- This is the map !

14
00:00:55,076 --> 00:00:57,815
The map that I drew for you.
I gave this to you in your tent.

15
00:00:57,874 --> 00:01:00,243
You were gonna burn it but
your wife offered to do it.

16
00:01:00,314 --> 00:01:01,704
But she didn't, did she ?

17
00:01:01,836 --> 00:01:02,716
I...

18
00:01:03,178 --> 00:01:05,817
I want to explain.
He said he'd kill you.

19
00:01:05,934 --> 00:01:09,488
- Who said ?
- One of the brother Cavils.

20
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,057
This is Kacey.

21
00:01:13,815 --> 00:01:15,246
Kacey,

22
00:01:15,434 --> 00:01:17,358
this is Kara...

23
00:01:17,592 --> 00:01:18,739
your mother.

24
00:01:23,987 --> 00:01:25,705
Our people
are gonna attack the air base,

25
00:01:25,765 --> 00:01:28,316
detention center, power station
and other critical facilities.

26
00:01:28,374 --> 00:01:30,814
The plan is to sow as much
chaos and confusion as possible

27
00:01:30,885 --> 00:01:32,674
the moment
Galactica and Pegasus arrive.

28
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,857
No pegasus. Just galactica.

29
00:01:35,245 --> 00:01:38,272
These are your orders.
Take the civilian fleet

30
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:41,896
and wait for me for 18 hours.
If I'm not back in 18 hours,

31
00:01:42,037 --> 00:01:43,327
then find Earth.

32
00:01:43,465 --> 00:01:44,720
<i>You know the mission.</i>

33
00:01:44,825 --> 00:01:48,004
<i>You should also know there's
only one way that this mission ends,</i>

34
00:01:48,145 --> 00:01:51,136
<i>and that's with
the successful rescue of our people</i>

35
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:53,106
<i>off of New Caprica.</i>

36
00:01:54,722 --> 00:01:56,660
<i>Good hunting.</i>

37
00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:07,451
Hoshi's working on updating our map
coordinates for the search for Earth.

38
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:13,778
Civilian captains want to meet with you.
They have questions...

39
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,936
... problems.

40
00:02:19,491 --> 00:02:21,059
Talk to me, Lee.

41
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:27,336
I'm having trouble...

42
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:31,953
- ... accepting this.
- I know.

43
00:02:32,505 --> 00:02:34,897
But we have to push forward.

44
00:02:35,331 --> 00:02:37,377
Keep the fleet together.

45
00:02:37,642 --> 00:02:39,202
Find Earth.

46
00:02:40,528 --> 00:02:42,068
Right, that's our duty.

47
00:02:42,138 --> 00:02:43,892
There's still
a chance they'll come back.

48
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:47,763
Your father has pulled off
more than a few miracles in his day.

49
00:02:48,584 --> 00:02:50,297
I know that.

50
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,873
And I haven't given up hope.

51
00:02:57,442 --> 00:02:59,249
Yes, you have.

52
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,793
I saw the look on your face
when you came back from Galactica.

53
00:03:05,854 --> 00:03:08,611
Like you were never
gonna see him again.

54
00:03:10,347 --> 00:03:12,540
Am I that easy to read ?

55
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,944
Just to me.

56
00:03:20,624 --> 00:03:22,994
He's taking on too much

57
00:03:23,322 --> 00:03:26,955
for one half-strength
Battlestar to handle.

58
00:03:27,429 --> 00:03:30,040
And that's not opinion.
That's military fact.

59
00:03:32,027 --> 00:03:35,001
He's not coming back from this,
none of them are.

60
00:03:36,109 --> 00:03:38,788
All we can do
is make plans for the future.

61
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,814
We have to survive.

62
00:03:42,964 --> 00:03:44,762
We have to find Earth.

63
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:48,915
If we don't, they'll be no one to
remember a man named William Adama.

64
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,786
Or a Battlestar named Galactica.

65
00:03:52,924 --> 00:03:54,859
That is our charge to keep.

66
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,887
To keep humanity going.

67
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,468
No matter what the cost.
No matter...

68
00:04:01,954 --> 00:04:04,965
- no matter who we leave behind.
- You can do this.

69
00:04:05,168 --> 00:04:07,068
You can get us there.

70
00:04:10,027 --> 00:04:11,921
You are Commander of this fleet,

71
00:04:12,244 --> 00:04:14,156
and you will guide us to safety.

72
00:04:14,286 --> 00:04:16,608
And you will do it no matter the cost.

73
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,221
Because you're an Adama.

74
00:04:26,864 --> 00:04:29,267
Did I ever tell you
how proud I am to serve with you ?

75
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:31,646
Not in so many words, no.

76
00:04:32,749 --> 00:04:35,318
Well, I am proud
to serve with you, Lieutenant.

77
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,261
And to call you my wife.

78
00:04:44,278 --> 00:04:46,307
Now let's talk about...

79
00:04:46,483 --> 00:04:48,282
map coordinates,

80
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,593
meeting with ships' captains.

81
00:05:01,351 --> 00:05:02,958
I lost three men today

82
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:05,750
and if that sergeant wasn't
on her game, they'd have killed us all.

83
00:05:05,821 --> 00:05:09,046
I know, godsdamn it. You don't have
to keep running your mouth about it.

84
00:05:09,152 --> 00:05:11,932
- I get it, all right ?
- You get this.

85
00:05:12,131 --> 00:05:15,251
If Sharon had been killed, not only
would we not get the launch keys,

86
00:05:15,325 --> 00:05:18,727
but the Cylons would know that we were
in direct contact with Galactica.

87
00:05:18,903 --> 00:05:21,906
Now this whole plan,
the fate of this whole city,

88
00:05:21,981 --> 00:05:24,356
would have fallen apart.
Do you understand that, Colonel ?

89
00:05:24,438 --> 00:05:26,049
I get it.

90
00:05:27,983 --> 00:05:29,223
Good.

91
00:05:32,507 --> 00:05:34,857
You know what has to be done here.

92
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,375
If you don't want to do it,
I understand.

93
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:40,558
But believe me, Colonel,
someone is gonna do this.

94
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:44,175
Now, it would be better
for her sake if it was you.

102
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,093
I had to do it, Saul.

103
00:06:49,886 --> 00:06:51,389
I had to.

104
00:06:52,362 --> 00:06:53,485
It was all for you.

105
00:06:54,671 --> 00:06:56,416
And I want you to know

106
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,183
that I would have done
anything to save you.

107
00:06:59,234 --> 00:07:01,375
I know, I know. It's all right.

108
00:07:01,405 --> 00:07:03,993
- Everything's gonna be all right.
- No, you don't understand.

109
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,346
I got you out of detention, Saul.

110
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,110
It was me.

111
00:07:11,993 --> 00:07:13,657
I got you out.

112
00:07:15,438 --> 00:07:16,969
I went to see them,

113
00:07:17,368 --> 00:07:18,737
the Cylons.

114
00:07:21,513 --> 00:07:23,676
Finally got to the one in charge.

115
00:07:25,621 --> 00:07:28,435
And I got him to notice me

116
00:07:29,133 --> 00:07:31,775
the way men notice me.

117
00:07:36,488 --> 00:07:38,352
I slept with him.

118
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:42,430
And I felt like puking every time
he put his filthy hands on me.

119
00:07:43,211 --> 00:07:44,644
But I smiled

120
00:07:44,726 --> 00:07:46,506
and I faked it

121
00:07:46,606 --> 00:07:48,653
to save you, Saul.

122
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,385
But you listen to me.

123
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,048
I'd do it again.

124
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:57,294
Frak anybody, do anything.

125
00:08:01,468 --> 00:08:02,832
Even gave 'em the map.

126
00:08:07,842 --> 00:08:10,522
I didn't want anybody...

127
00:08:11,485 --> 00:08:13,473
... to be killed.

128
00:08:29,207 --> 00:08:30,828
I could use a drink.

129
00:08:56,723 --> 00:08:59,649
You've always been there
for me when I needed you.

130
00:09:05,047 --> 00:09:06,521
I'm exhausted.

131
00:09:07,586 --> 00:09:09,508
I feel like I could just curl up here.

132
00:09:15,144 --> 00:09:17,163
Should have listened to you, Saul.

133
00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:20,323
Should have stayed on Galactica.

134
00:09:20,874 --> 00:09:23,008
Don't worry about any of that now.

135
00:09:24,642 --> 00:09:25,928
You just...

136
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:30,351
- ... you just go to sleep.
- I'm sleepy.

137
00:09:46,758 --> 00:09:48,184
I love you,

138
00:09:49,093 --> 00:09:50,682
Do you hear me ?

139
00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:39,506
{\a6}I mean, I told you and I told you.

140
00:10:40,954 --> 00:10:42,169
{\a6}But to what end ?

141
00:10:43,016 --> 00:10:46,079
{\a6}Too secure in your smug
superiority to listen.

142
00:10:46,195 --> 00:10:48,324
{\a6}Too comfortable

143
00:10:48,806 --> 00:10:51,384
{\a6}in your predictions of success to

144
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:54,267
{\a6}even consider
the possibility of defeat.

145
00:10:55,332 --> 00:10:57,195
{\a6}And where are we now ?

146
00:10:58,326 --> 00:10:59,909
{\a6}And more to the point,

147
00:11:00,971 --> 00:11:02,585
{\a6}where's Laura Roslin ?

148
00:11:04,299 --> 00:11:05,631
Where's Tom Zarek ?

149
00:11:07,643 --> 00:11:08,791
{\a6}At large.

150
00:11:09,623 --> 00:11:12,186
{\a6}Whereabouts unknown.
Free at any rate.

151
00:11:12,318 --> 00:11:14,148
Probably with Colonel Tigh.

152
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,742
{\a6}Solidifying the insurgency's
hold over the public's imagination.

153
00:11:18,798 --> 00:11:20,795
What would you have us do, Gaius ?

154
00:11:24,696 --> 00:11:26,102
Leave.

155
00:11:27,413 --> 00:11:29,266
{\a6}Pack up your Centurions

156
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,046
{\a6}and go.

157
00:11:33,204 --> 00:11:35,687
{\a6}Please, go.

158
00:11:36,412 --> 00:11:37,503
{\a6}And then what ?

159
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:41,137
What would you do if we
really just left you here ?

160
00:11:41,354 --> 00:11:42,631
{\a6}You'd live out your lives

161
00:11:42,697 --> 00:11:45,682
{\a6}in peace and never trouble
yourselves with thoughts of us again ?

162
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:48,673
{\a6}Or would you raise your children
with stories of the Cylon ?

163
00:11:49,164 --> 00:11:52,466
{\a6}The mechanical slaves who once did
your bidding only to turn against you.

164
00:11:53,224 --> 00:11:56,152
{\a6}Killers who committed genocide
against your race.

165
00:11:56,532 --> 00:11:59,871
{\a6}And occupiers of this city
until we just ran away.

166
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:04,227
{\a6}Would you tell them to tell
the story to their children ?

167
00:12:04,368 --> 00:12:06,739
{\a6}And to their children's children ?

168
00:12:06,925 --> 00:12:09,661
{\a6}And nurse a dream of vengeance
down through the years

169
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,536
{\a6}so that one day
they could just go out

170
00:12:11,592 --> 00:12:13,677
{\a6}into the stars and hunt
the Cylon once more.

171
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,918
{\a6}Blood for blood.

172
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,047
{\a6}It has to stop one day.

173
00:12:31,564 --> 00:12:32,829
Oh, my Gods.

174
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,127
{\a6}Nice job, Anders.

175
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,796
Come on. Come on.

176
00:13:00,584 --> 00:13:02,496
Come on. Okay, that's our cue.

177
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,495
You know what to do.

178
00:13:03,564 --> 00:13:06,035
Rally your people and get them
to the evac points.

179
00:13:06,141 --> 00:13:08,429
Okay, remember the drills,
and you'll do fine.

180
00:13:08,445 --> 00:13:10,627
Go with the Gods. Go, go, go !

181
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,040
Tory, would you tell Laura

182
00:13:14,086 --> 00:13:17,085
- I can't thank her enough...
- Tell her yourself when it's all over.

183
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,824
Wish we were all as calm as she is.

184
00:13:19,773 --> 00:13:22,043
- Get them to their ship. Go, go !
- Yes, Ma'am.

185
00:13:53,287 --> 00:13:54,321
Let's move, let's move,

186
00:13:55,974 --> 00:13:57,050
All right, this is it.

187
00:13:57,296 --> 00:13:59,417
We get to the detention center
and we do not stop

188
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:01,005
until everybody is out of there free.

189
00:14:01,122 --> 00:14:04,309
Everybody knows their entry points.
Let's load up and we move right now.

190
00:14:05,672 --> 00:14:07,951
Let's move, Connor.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

191
00:14:16,735 --> 00:14:19,211
Decoy squadron approaching
launch point.

192
00:14:33,555 --> 00:14:35,725
<i>Okay, this is it guys. Stand by.</i>

193
00:14:36,129 --> 00:14:37,835
All Vipers break...

194
00:14:38,183 --> 00:14:39,575
... now, now, now !

195
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:44,052
Deploy drones on my mark.

196
00:14:44,722 --> 00:14:48,009
Three, Two, One...

197
00:14:48,673 --> 00:14:49,416
Mark.

198
00:15:03,848 --> 00:15:05,022
Drone signatures match.

199
00:15:07,088 --> 00:15:09,032
Cylons should pick up
the drones on Dradis

200
00:15:09,086 --> 00:15:10,943
and read them
as two Battlestars any minute.

201
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,292
<i>Transport all the prisonners...</i>

202
00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:22,811
<i>What ? No, no, no.</i>

203
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:25,131
<i>Immediate evac from sector V as in...</i>

204
00:15:25,874 --> 00:15:27,435
<i>V as in Victor.</i>

205
00:15:28,292 --> 00:15:30,454
<i>I could use the Centurions warriors.</i>

206
00:15:34,174 --> 00:15:35,267
For nothing.

207
00:15:37,613 --> 00:15:38,738
All for nothing.

208
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:40,692
We'll start over, Gaius.

209
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,551
- A new city to rise out of the ashes.
- No.

210
00:15:46,434 --> 00:15:47,812
It'll be buried.

211
00:15:49,709 --> 00:15:51,669
Buried like the cities of old.

212
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:55,000
Consumed by the wrath of God.

213
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,299
Two Battlestars just jumped into orbit.

214
00:16:00,049 --> 00:16:01,108
Adama's back.

215
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,927
Kat, Racetrack.

216
00:16:23,135 --> 00:16:24,311
Two Baseships on Dradis

217
00:16:24,326 --> 00:16:27,274
<i>bearing 0-0-2 carom 0-1-5.</i>

218
00:16:32,184 --> 00:16:33,271
They're launching Raiders.

219
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:34,924
<i>Red squadron, Kat.</i>

220
00:16:34,934 --> 00:16:35,941
<i>We've done our part.</i>

221
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:39,067
<i>Kick in the Turbos.
Let's get the hell out of here.</i>

222
00:16:46,397 --> 00:16:47,267
What's going on ?

223
00:16:47,316 --> 00:16:48,954
Insurgents. I'll be back.

224
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:50,756
You can not leave us trapped in here.

225
00:16:50,767 --> 00:16:52,436
- It's safest for you here.
- No !

226
00:17:07,536 --> 00:17:08,933
Let's go, let's go.

227
00:17:09,745 --> 00:17:11,273
<i>Move, move !</i>

228
00:17:12,347 --> 00:17:13,210
<i>Run !</i>

229
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,717
Tom, you go that way.
Head to the shipyard.

230
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,713
- You're coming, right ?
- My ship's up there.

231
00:17:20,553 --> 00:17:21,954
You have a sense of the dramatic.

232
00:17:22,505 --> 00:17:24,508
Hey, wait, Laura.
Wait, wait.

233
00:17:24,635 --> 00:17:26,656
- You were on Galactica ?
- I didn't do anything.

234
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:28,823
No, it's okay.
Keep an eye on her, all right ?

235
00:17:28,869 --> 00:17:30,419
Don't let her
out of your sight, go !

236
00:17:30,723 --> 00:17:32,623
- See you up there.
- See you up there.

237
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:38,236
Jump preparation complete.

238
00:17:39,061 --> 00:17:40,876
My board is green.
Ready to jump, sir.

239
00:17:42,045 --> 00:17:43,779
Stand by to launch blue squadron.

240
00:17:43,966 --> 00:17:44,896
This is the Admiral.

241
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:48,426
All hands,
brace for turbulence.

242
00:17:49,745 --> 00:17:52,239
Baseships just closed
on the Battlestar targets.

243
00:17:52,894 --> 00:17:54,457
There's no Galactica, no Pegasus.

244
00:17:56,487 --> 00:17:57,394
Drones.

245
00:17:59,855 --> 00:18:00,895
Decoys.

246
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,677
The whole thing's a trick.

247
00:18:04,222 --> 00:18:05,200
Where's Galactica ?

248
00:18:47,183 --> 00:18:49,610
Altitude 99,000,
falling like a rock.

249
00:18:49,689 --> 00:18:50,988
Launch !
Launch them all !

250
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,387
Stand by FTL.

251
00:18:52,608 --> 00:18:53,617
Clear for launch.

252
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:56,344
Well, this ought to be different.

253
00:19:05,293 --> 00:19:06,681
- They're clear.
- Stand by.

254
00:19:08,811 --> 00:19:09,577
Jump !

255
00:19:22,184 --> 00:19:23,845
Vipers !
Everybody hold, hold !

256
00:19:26,262 --> 00:19:27,319
Hotdog, redwing.

257
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,818
I see friendlies pinned down
outside the shipyard gate.

258
00:19:29,984 --> 00:19:32,734
Roger. Redwing, target the guard tower.
I've got the gate.

259
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:33,959
Rolling in hot.

260
00:19:34,565 --> 00:19:35,699
Incoming !

261
00:19:47,073 --> 00:19:49,087
That's it ! Let's go !
Let's go ! Go ! Go !

262
00:19:49,236 --> 00:19:51,184
Move ! Go !

263
00:19:51,936 --> 00:19:52,999
Move !

264
00:19:53,169 --> 00:19:54,159
Move !

265
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:55,909
Godsdamn it.

266
00:19:55,973 --> 00:19:58,003
Come on, move !
Move, move !

267
00:19:58,227 --> 00:20:00,971
Let's go !
Move, people, come on !

268
00:20:01,062 --> 00:20:02,678
- Come on, move !
- Hurry up !

269
00:20:18,578 --> 00:20:19,688
Fire in the hole !

270
00:20:20,523 --> 00:20:21,713
Fire in the hole !

271
00:20:27,582 --> 00:20:29,774
All right, everybody,
let's move !

272
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:32,617
Head north to the shipyard, now.
Move !

273
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,550
Hustle !

274
00:20:43,129 --> 00:20:45,609
Kara ?
Oh, Gods, no.

275
00:20:46,338 --> 00:20:47,312
No. No !

276
00:20:54,191 --> 00:20:56,688
I'm gonna get you out of here.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

277
00:21:14,243 --> 00:21:16,346
All divisions make
damage report to combat.

278
00:21:16,418 --> 00:21:18,467
- Main batteries report weapons status.
- Dradis.

279
00:21:25,264 --> 00:21:26,083
Back on line.

280
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:30,923
Cylon Baseships
coming out of the nebula.

281
00:21:31,057 --> 00:21:32,762
Just as we expected.

282
00:21:33,446 --> 00:21:35,837
Cylon Raiders are still
scattered to hell and gone.

283
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,039
They're coming after us
without fighter cover.

284
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,664
If we can draw the two
basestars away from the planet,

285
00:21:42,695 --> 00:21:44,259
the colonists might be
able to escape.

286
00:21:44,274 --> 00:21:45,078
Hang on.

287
00:21:45,185 --> 00:21:47,260
Two more Baseships
just jumped into orbit.

288
00:21:47,355 --> 00:21:49,660
- We've got four Baseships out there.
- No.

289
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:53,286
We can't hold off four.

290
00:22:00,646 --> 00:22:01,851
Pass up the cord.

291
00:22:03,819 --> 00:22:04,644
Hold still.

292
00:22:04,725 --> 00:22:06,644
Connect the other side right away.

293
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:10,563
We've lost maneuvering thrusters.
We can't take any more hits to port or

294
00:22:10,637 --> 00:22:12,618
we're looking at explosive
decompressions

295
00:22:12,692 --> 00:22:15,121
- in sections 36 through 48.
- Jump drives.

296
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:33,548
Then that's it.

297
00:22:38,376 --> 00:22:39,684
It's been an honor.

298
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:24,893
Galactica, Pegasus.

299
00:23:24,974 --> 00:23:27,431
Let us take some
of this work off your hands.

300
00:23:27,509 --> 00:23:30,192
<i>Get your FTL up and ready,
and we'll take care of the rest.

301
00:23:30,381 --> 00:23:32,889
- All right, fire up that main battery !
- Copy that, Sir.

302
00:23:32,997 --> 00:23:34,727
Damn you, Lee.

303
00:23:34,939 --> 00:23:37,217
Keep working on those FTLs.
Get 'em online.

304
00:23:37,271 --> 00:23:38,242
Yes, sir.

305
00:23:38,431 --> 00:23:41,154
The Cylons will re-deploy
as soon as they recover.

306
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,346
Thank you, Lee.

307
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:46,399
They're coming about.

308
00:23:46,482 --> 00:23:47,739
Maneuvering to bracket us.

309
00:23:48,341 --> 00:23:50,607
Steady as she goes.
Take us right into the center.

310
00:23:53,087 --> 00:23:54,543
Won't last long in there.

311
00:23:55,036 --> 00:23:55,959
No.

312
00:24:00,245 --> 00:24:02,511
Put me down ! Wait !

313
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:05,119
Stop ! Put me down !

314
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:14,236
- Is it really you ?
- Baby, it's really me. But listen,

315
00:24:14,278 --> 00:24:16,176
we don't have time.
We're going to the ships,

316
00:24:16,219 --> 00:24:17,718
and we're gonna get the hell off

317
00:24:17,776 --> 00:24:19,181
- this frakkin' planet.
- Okay.

318
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:21,333
- Where's Kacey ?
- Who's Kacey ?

319
00:24:22,007 --> 00:24:24,825
- Kacey, she's my daughter.
- Kara, who's Kacey ?

320
00:24:24,933 --> 00:24:27,441
- She's my daughter !
- Kara ! Kara, no ! Kara !

321
00:24:28,223 --> 00:24:30,756
Godsdamnit, Kara, no !
Out of the way !

322
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:34,239
Godsdamnit, Kara, no !

323
00:24:37,198 --> 00:24:39,642
We've lost control
of the situation on the surface.

324
00:24:40,266 --> 00:24:43,121
There's a heavy raider
standing by ready to evacuate us.

325
00:24:43,454 --> 00:24:44,857
We're agreed.

326
00:24:44,951 --> 00:24:46,631
Evacuate the entire facility.

327
00:24:47,311 --> 00:24:49,288
I'll stay behind and set off the nuke.

328
00:24:56,585 --> 00:24:58,178
You should go as well, Caprica.

329
00:24:59,363 --> 00:25:00,468
And you.

330
00:25:01,992 --> 00:25:04,358
I don't think you'll want
to be here after we've gone.

331
00:25:05,201 --> 00:25:06,939
There's a place for you, too.

332
00:25:07,023 --> 00:25:08,050
For me ?

333
00:25:10,527 --> 00:25:12,873
Well, you were right and we were wrong.

334
00:25:13,008 --> 00:25:14,832
Should be some reward for that.

335
00:25:16,985 --> 00:25:18,779
Gaius, we should go.

336
00:25:19,911 --> 00:25:22,276
I just want to sit here and die.

337
00:25:23,516 --> 00:25:25,498
You're gonna get your wish, Gaius.

338
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:44,614
The ships are getting off the ground.

339
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:48,248
Jumping away. Only a few left.

340
00:25:48,342 --> 00:25:50,082
FTL's back online.

341
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:52,107
Pegasus is taking
a hell of a pounding, Sir.

342
00:25:52,181 --> 00:25:54,634
I don't think she has
a single plane in the air.

343
00:25:54,774 --> 00:25:57,652
Lee left all of his planes
to guard the civilian ships.

344
00:25:57,997 --> 00:26:01,756
He knew that was a one-way trip.
He'll evac before the end.

345
00:26:01,822 --> 00:26:04,226
- You sure ?
- Land our birds !

346
00:26:05,062 --> 00:26:06,890
Let's get the hell out of here.

347
00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:10,750
<i>All wings, Galactica. Come on home.
Combat landings authorized.

348
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:12,990
<i>Repeat, come on home.

349
00:26:13,192 --> 00:26:16,206
<i>All hands, all hands, get ready to jump.

350
00:26:23,483 --> 00:26:24,926
I believed in you.

351
00:26:25,411 --> 00:26:27,684
Whoa, whoa. Gaeta.

352
00:26:27,946 --> 00:26:29,964
I believed in the dream of New Caprica.

353
00:26:30,058 --> 00:26:31,765
- Gaeta, we all did.
- No !

354
00:26:32,485 --> 00:26:33,618
No.

355
00:26:33,915 --> 00:26:35,717
Not him. He believed in

356
00:26:35,856 --> 00:26:37,663
the dream of Gaius Baltar.

357
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:42,652
The good life. Booze, pills,
hot and cold running interns.

358
00:26:43,245 --> 00:26:45,389
He lead us to the apocalypse, and...

359
00:26:46,926 --> 00:26:48,396
and I...

360
00:26:48,517 --> 00:26:51,012
- I turned out to be...
- ... an idealist.

361
00:26:54,598 --> 00:26:56,131
There's no sin in that.

362
00:27:02,291 --> 00:27:04,516
Everything you say about me is true.

363
00:27:05,285 --> 00:27:06,525
Every word.

364
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,769
But you have to listen to me.

365
00:27:11,397 --> 00:27:13,541
The Cylons have a nuke in this complex.

366
00:27:16,372 --> 00:27:17,882
Nobody,

367
00:27:18,154 --> 00:27:21,538
and I mean nobody is getting off
this planet alive unless I stop that.

368
00:27:21,619 --> 00:27:23,871
- Gaius, she'll kill you.
- Then she'll kill me.

369
00:27:24,087 --> 00:27:26,055
Or it'll be down to Mr. Gaeta.

370
00:27:26,932 --> 00:27:28,361
Either way,

371
00:27:28,739 --> 00:27:30,667
the human race dies with me.

372
00:27:32,846 --> 00:27:33,863
Gaius, he...

373
00:27:34,925 --> 00:27:36,724
Go ahead, shoot.

374
00:27:38,829 --> 00:27:40,641
What are you waiting for ?

375
00:27:44,925 --> 00:27:46,473
Please.

376
00:27:48,244 --> 00:27:49,735
Please.

377
00:27:50,567 --> 00:27:52,737
I'm begging you, please...

378
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:03,961
You have one chance to put things right.

379
00:28:04,245 --> 00:28:07,190
Do you understand me ?
Get the frak out of here !

380
00:28:07,295 --> 00:28:09,574
Stop that nuke ! Go !

381
00:28:09,864 --> 00:28:11,835
Gaius, let's go !

382
00:28:17,535 --> 00:28:20,808
Set main batteries to autofire cycle-B.

383
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:23,001
Lock engines ahead flank.

384
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:26,100
This is the Commander.
Abandon ship, abandon ship.

385
00:28:26,152 --> 00:28:27,677
All hands, abandon ship.

386
00:28:27,736 --> 00:28:31,177
Report to evac Raptors
and jump to rendezvous point.

387
00:28:31,283 --> 00:28:34,556
Good work,
and I'll see you on the other side.

388
00:28:35,036 --> 00:28:37,641
Okay, all right, people,
let's move ! Out !

389
00:28:37,723 --> 00:28:39,154
Let's go !

390
00:28:41,755 --> 00:28:43,433
You too, Commander.

391
00:28:43,925 --> 00:28:45,814
Yes, sir.

392
00:28:56,018 --> 00:28:57,590
Thank you.

393
00:29:52,867 --> 00:29:54,498
Kacey ?

394
00:29:55,565 --> 00:29:57,278
Kacey !

395
00:29:59,823 --> 00:30:02,451
Kacey, honey, where are you ?

396
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,043
Ka...

397
00:30:10,524 --> 00:30:13,328
I knew you'd be back. I saw it.

398
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:27,220
Give me Kacey.

399
00:30:27,877 --> 00:30:29,115
Say the words.

400
00:30:29,185 --> 00:30:31,027
- Let me take her.
- Say them.

401
00:30:31,085 --> 00:30:33,678
- What words ?
- You know what I want.

402
00:30:33,772 --> 00:30:36,493
I want to hear you say them.
And I want the rest of it.

403
00:30:36,575 --> 00:30:38,253
Just like I told you.

404
00:30:47,113 --> 00:30:48,603
Fine.

405
00:30:49,706 --> 00:30:51,043
You win.

406
00:30:56,041 --> 00:30:57,472
I love you.

407
00:31:05,538 --> 00:31:07,678
Say it again.

408
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:18,035
I love you.

409
00:31:24,137 --> 00:31:25,674
Now the rest.

410
00:31:54,378 --> 00:31:56,744
Was it everything
you thought it would be ?

411
00:31:57,795 --> 00:31:59,989
That and more.

412
00:32:00,564 --> 00:32:03,133
I'll never forget this moment.

413
00:32:06,323 --> 00:32:07,930
Neither will I.

414
00:33:02,427 --> 00:33:05,600
I'll explain later. Let's move.

415
00:33:09,963 --> 00:33:13,283
- Are you sure she's in there ?
- Positive, I saw her go in.

416
00:33:35,003 --> 00:33:37,197
Frakking liar.

417
00:34:05,614 --> 00:34:07,664
It's her, Gaius.

418
00:34:08,324 --> 00:34:10,831
The first of God's new generation.

419
00:34:14,211 --> 00:34:15,413
Hera.

420
00:34:24,279 --> 00:34:26,003
It's a miracle.

421
00:34:30,097 --> 00:34:32,275
God spared her.

422
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,432
Hera.

423
00:34:56,216 --> 00:34:57,797
Can I hold her ?

424
00:35:13,951 --> 00:35:15,429
No.

425
00:35:16,594 --> 00:35:19,337
She won't set off the nuke, not anymore.

426
00:35:20,052 --> 00:35:22,879
Come on, Gaius, we have to go.

427
00:36:15,483 --> 00:36:17,102
All right.

428
00:36:18,334 --> 00:36:20,105
I'm ready to go.

429
00:36:31,953 --> 00:36:33,907
All right, people, let's go. This way.

430
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:37,502
Stay on the starboard hangar deck
'till we can get you to the new ships.

431
00:36:37,942 --> 00:36:41,767
Come on, people, all the way down.
All the way down, people, let's go.

432
00:36:45,865 --> 00:36:47,519
Oh, my Gods.

433
00:36:47,624 --> 00:36:49,173
Captain ?

434
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:52,586
- I thought you were dead.
- Yeah,

435
00:36:52,645 --> 00:36:54,064
so did I.

436
00:36:54,538 --> 00:36:56,427
Who's this ?

437
00:36:56,486 --> 00:36:58,222
Yeah, I was gonna ask that myself.

438
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:00,216
- This is...
- Kacey ?

439
00:37:03,242 --> 00:37:04,697
Kacey !

440
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:06,570
Oh, my little girl !

441
00:37:06,723 --> 00:37:09,268
Mommy missed you so much !

442
00:37:10,429 --> 00:37:11,802
Thank you.

443
00:37:12,588 --> 00:37:13,678
Thank you !

444
00:37:14,676 --> 00:37:16,060
Thank you.

445
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:20,048
When the Cylons took her, I thought...

446
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,954
but you saved her.

447
00:37:25,549 --> 00:37:27,508
The Gods bless you.

448
00:37:29,232 --> 00:37:30,557
Hey.

449
00:37:43,746 --> 00:37:45,084
Thank you, sir.

450
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:48,084
Welcome aboard. Welcome.

451
00:37:57,372 --> 00:37:59,097
Welcome aboard.

452
00:38:09,982 --> 00:38:11,776
I guess you didn't
understand my orders ?

453
00:38:11,835 --> 00:38:13,959
Never could read your handwriting.

454
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:22,432
Permission to come aboard, sir.

455
00:38:31,449 --> 00:38:33,021
Hey.

456
00:38:39,449 --> 00:38:41,573
Permission granted.

457
00:38:51,139 --> 00:38:52,840
You did it.

458
00:38:53,561 --> 00:38:55,754
Your brought 'em home, Saul.

459
00:38:56,188 --> 00:38:58,335
Not all of them.

460
00:39:03,461 --> 00:39:04,842
I'm sorry.

461
00:40:02,459 --> 00:40:06,272
We're still double-checking
the fleet's manifests but...

462
00:40:07,797 --> 00:40:11,061
it doesn't look like Maya
made it off of New Caprica.

463
00:40:16,774 --> 00:40:18,895
What about the baby ?

464
00:40:23,793 --> 00:40:28,113
I was there when the two guards
left to take them to their ship.

465
00:40:29,294 --> 00:40:31,593
I don't know what happened.

466
00:40:33,141 --> 00:40:36,894
I'm so sorry,
I let you down and I know that.

467
00:40:39,874 --> 00:40:41,571
No, you didn't.

468
00:40:43,589 --> 00:40:45,876
It's not your fault.

469
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:48,375
This is bigger than us.

470
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:01,650
This is life.

471
00:42:04,326 --> 00:42:08,361
<i>All hands, proceed to your support
teams. Stand by for ships assignments.

472
00:42:22,524 --> 00:42:26,160
Thanks to watch Battlestar Galactica
with our subs.
