5
00:00:56,517 --> 00:00:59,142
Everyone of importance
is being looked at right now.

6
00:00:59,394 --> 00:01:01,019
You're no exception.

7
00:01:01,718 --> 00:01:03,814
I can help you, Laura.

8
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,401
In ways I can not help myself.

9
00:01:11,287 --> 00:01:12,990
I can protect you.

10
00:01:13,241 --> 00:01:15,909
But you have to understand
the situation has changed now.

11
00:01:15,999 --> 00:01:17,995
The insurgency has crossed the line.

12
00:01:18,065 --> 00:01:20,080
Suicide bombings.

13
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:23,069
It's abhorrent.

14
00:01:25,128 --> 00:01:27,421
It's contrary to everything
that we believe in.

15
00:01:29,591 --> 00:01:31,049
So you...

16
00:01:31,968 --> 00:01:33,594
you and I, we will...

17
00:01:34,596 --> 00:01:36,722
we will publicly condemn these tactics.

18
00:01:36,973 --> 00:01:39,892
They can not be legitimized
in any shape or form.

19
00:01:40,185 --> 00:01:42,686
There's something that scares
the cylons after all.

20
00:01:42,938 --> 00:01:46,148
I should think using men and women
as human bombs should scare us all.

21
00:01:46,242 --> 00:01:48,483
Desperate people take desperate measures.

22
00:01:48,618 --> 00:01:49,985
All right, look me in the eye.

23
00:01:50,237 --> 00:01:52,446
Look me in the eye and tell me

24
00:01:52,572 --> 00:01:55,953
that you approve of sending
young men and women

25
00:01:56,065 --> 00:02:01,121
into crowded places with explosives
strapped to their chests.

26
00:02:05,419 --> 00:02:09,046
I'm waiting for you to look me
in the eye and tell me that you approve.

27
00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:18,639
33 people killed.

28
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:21,892
And their only crime was
putting on the police uniform

29
00:02:22,728 --> 00:02:25,319
- Trying to bring some order
to the chaos out there.
- Order ?

30
00:02:26,106 --> 00:02:28,357
By arresting innocent people
in the dead of night.

31
00:02:28,608 --> 00:02:31,485
Detaining them indefinitely without charge.

32
00:02:31,737 --> 00:02:35,364
- Torturing them for information !
- Wait a minute ! Nobody's been tortured.

33
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,953
- Tell that to colonel Tigh.
- Nobody has been tortured.

34
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:51,171
We're done here.

35
00:02:57,679 --> 00:03:01,849
I hope you understand
the severity of the situation.

36
00:03:01,992 --> 00:03:05,894
I ask you to obey the dictates
of your conscience...

37
00:03:06,982 --> 00:03:08,783
which is what I've always done.

38
00:03:08,899 --> 00:03:11,608
Of that I have no doubt.

39
00:03:14,505 --> 00:03:17,322
Please give this lovely lady
her shoes back.

40
00:03:18,074 --> 00:03:19,950
Then get her out of here.

41
00:03:25,913 --> 00:03:27,749
<i>Curfew is now in effect.</i>

42
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:31,503
<i>Severe penalties will be imposed
on anyone found on the streets.</i>

43
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,051
<i>Curfew is now in effect.</i>

44
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:41,805
<i>Severe penalties will be imposed
on anyone found on the streets.</i>

45
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:39,988
You understand your orders, Captain ?
Everything clear ?

46
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,573
Yes, sir.

47
00:04:41,716 --> 00:04:43,450
Good. Don't worry.

48
00:04:43,618 --> 00:04:45,619
We have your back.

49
00:04:52,627 --> 00:04:55,712
Did you hear ?
The cylons cut food rations today.

50
00:04:55,922 --> 00:04:57,089
We heard.

51
00:04:57,675 --> 00:05:00,092
How long before
the next Raptor transmission ?

52
00:05:01,762 --> 00:05:03,220
Two minutes.

53
00:05:05,265 --> 00:05:07,808
You know, they're talking about
shutting down the marketplace.

54
00:05:08,565 --> 00:05:10,227
It's a security risk.

55
00:05:11,062 --> 00:05:12,604
We'll shift target.

56
00:05:13,356 --> 00:05:15,315
You were gonna hit the marketplace ?

57
00:05:15,817 --> 00:05:16,900
The market ?

58
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,069
Full of civilians.

59
00:05:19,446 --> 00:05:20,612
This is crazy.

60
00:05:20,768 --> 00:05:23,031
You know, we need to figure out
whose side we're on.

61
00:05:23,617 --> 00:05:25,325
Which side are we on ?

62
00:05:26,411 --> 00:05:28,203
We're on the side of the demons, Chief.

63
00:05:28,455 --> 00:05:31,206
We're evil men in the gardens of paradise.

64
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,247
Sent by the forces of death

65
00:05:33,285 --> 00:05:37,087
to spread devastation
and destruction wherever we go.

66
00:05:38,131 --> 00:05:40,215
I'm surprised you didn't know that.

67
00:05:43,746 --> 00:05:45,054
Contact.

68
00:05:46,059 --> 00:05:47,973
Ready for the sitrep.

69
00:05:59,656 --> 00:06:03,071
Send it twice, just to make sure.

70
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,297
Here are the names of those
to be arrested and sent to detention.

71
00:06:23,036 --> 00:06:24,125
I...

72
00:06:25,183 --> 00:06:28,557
- I know some of these people.
- I'm sure you do.

73
00:06:29,186 --> 00:06:33,368
They're all insurgents, Jammer.
We have to break the cycle of violence.

74
00:06:39,554 --> 00:06:40,987
Ok, suit up.

75
00:06:46,029 --> 00:06:48,411
You won't have to wear
those much longer, eventually

76
00:06:48,453 --> 00:06:50,871
your people
will see you as heroes.

77
00:06:54,357 --> 00:06:56,002
Not tonight.

78
00:06:58,522 --> 00:07:01,683
Take numbers five through ten.
Okay, take the tents to the right.

79
00:07:01,714 --> 00:07:05,400
Follow down the end.
Rest of you guys gotta keep quiet, okay ?

80
00:07:07,564 --> 00:07:09,096
<i>This is New Caprica police.</i>

81
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,683
<i>You're under arrest for colluding
with the insurgency.</i>

82
00:07:12,912 --> 00:07:15,909
<i>You're wanting for questioning
in the graduation bomb.</i>

83
00:07:19,145 --> 00:07:21,733
Cally Tyrol, this is an NCP raid.

84
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,235
No ! Let go of me !

85
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:24,903
Get your hands up.

86
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,498
My baby ! No !

87
00:07:27,582 --> 00:07:29,540
No, my baby !

88
00:07:30,068 --> 00:07:31,551
No !

89
00:07:53,324 --> 00:07:54,472
No, no, no, no.

90
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,022
I got you. I got you.

91
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:59,278
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, there you go.

92
00:08:00,153 --> 00:08:01,484
Mommy's coming back.

93
00:08:01,525 --> 00:08:03,953
It's okay. It's okay.

94
00:08:08,332 --> 00:08:10,494
Their numbers are a little thin.

95
00:08:10,536 --> 00:08:13,994
It says here Tigh commands
1 150 armed effectives.

96
00:08:14,582 --> 00:08:17,948
That's a lot less than he should have
if you count all former fleet officers

97
00:08:18,021 --> 00:08:19,864
and enlisted available down there.

98
00:08:19,977 --> 00:08:23,350
Could be taking heavy losses.
They mentioned a cylon crackdown.

99
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:26,712
We should get a breakdown
of available pilots in the insurgent group.

100
00:08:26,808 --> 00:08:29,592
Somebody's gotta
fly those ships if we're gonna pull this off.

101
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,676
Those ships aren't going anywhere yet.

102
00:08:32,306 --> 00:08:37,069
"The cylons have removed launch keys from
grounded colonial ships. Location unknown."

103
00:08:37,313 --> 00:08:40,535
- Came from Tyrol.
- Can we manufacture new launch keys ?

104
00:08:40,605 --> 00:08:41,648
Forget it.

105
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:44,606
The specs on launch keys
are incredibly sophisticated.

106
00:08:44,648 --> 00:08:46,731
It would take weeks just to do the R&D.

107
00:08:46,773 --> 00:08:49,733
Best option is for Saul
and the people on the ground

108
00:08:49,734 --> 00:08:51,364
to find the original launch keys.

109
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:52,909
Assuming they weren't destroyed.

110
00:08:52,951 --> 00:08:54,703
No. No way.

111
00:08:54,787 --> 00:08:56,435
The cylons would want to keep them safe

112
00:08:56,474 --> 00:08:58,872
just in case they needed
to use one of those ships someday.

113
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:01,177
She's right.
Keys gotta still be there somewhere.

114
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,629
We can make a weapons drop
to the insurgents.

115
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,608
They know the lay of the land. They've been
hitting the cylons in the teeth for months.

116
00:09:07,678 --> 00:09:09,924
Give them the tools,
they can find the keys themselves.

117
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,591
No. No way.

118
00:09:11,633 --> 00:09:13,775
The only thing
you've got going for you so far

119
00:09:13,823 --> 00:09:17,224
is that the cylon reduced their
defense perimeter to just 5 baseships.

120
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:20,720
You put heavy weaponry, they'll know
that we're in contact with the population.

121
00:09:20,803 --> 00:09:23,627
Call in ten more baseships
and then your whole plan's fraked.

122
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:26,318
Funny. Thought this was our plan, sir.

123
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:27,720
Moving on.

124
00:09:28,069 --> 00:09:31,980
The military plans that you have in your
hands are to be kept with you at all times.

125
00:09:39,491 --> 00:09:41,097
Why'd they pick her up ?

126
00:09:41,272 --> 00:09:44,412
She hasn't done anything.
We've got a baby, for gods' sakes.

127
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,365
- I don't know. I'll try to find out.
- How long are they gonna hold her ?

128
00:09:48,863 --> 00:09:53,515
Detention is run by a separate ministry.
They don't give us any reasons why they...

129
00:09:53,633 --> 00:09:57,417
Godsdamn it, Felix !
She hasn't done anything. We've got a baby.

130
00:09:58,406 --> 00:10:00,377
I know, Galen.

131
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:02,587
I'm sorry.

132
00:10:02,777 --> 00:10:04,371
How do you do it ?

133
00:10:04,566 --> 00:10:08,862
How do you help them day after day ?
How do you look yourself in the mirror ?

134
00:10:11,556 --> 00:10:13,410
I gotta get my son.

135
00:10:13,744 --> 00:10:16,110
Cameron's watching him,
but she's got problems of her own.

136
00:10:16,195 --> 00:10:17,187
Chief !

137
00:10:19,348 --> 00:10:22,526
I'll see what I can do. I'll see
if there's something I can find out.

138
00:10:24,772 --> 00:10:27,205
Why don't you try and do something ?

139
00:10:57,806 --> 00:11:00,823
<i>Please ! No ! No !</i>

140
00:11:05,602 --> 00:11:07,587
Hey, you okay ?

141
00:11:07,773 --> 00:11:09,224
Jammer, what's going on ?

142
00:11:10,927 --> 00:11:11,982
Yeah.

143
00:11:12,645 --> 00:11:14,176
- Yeah, I'm okay, Chief.
- All right.

144
00:11:15,969 --> 00:11:17,792
I heard about last night.

145
00:11:19,008 --> 00:11:21,122
- What ?
- About Cally being on one of those lists.

146
00:11:21,165 --> 00:11:21,957
Yeah.

147
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,841
- I'm really sorry
- Yeah.

148
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:26,238
Frakking human police, huh ?

149
00:11:27,394 --> 00:11:28,922
Bunch of traitors if you ask me.

150
00:11:28,993 --> 00:11:32,985
Some of those guys who joined up,
I bet they're in over their heads, you know ?

151
00:11:33,135 --> 00:11:36,762
Especially now with
these suicide bombings and...

152
00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:39,439
at first, I bet you they thought
they were doing something good.

153
00:11:39,494 --> 00:11:41,469
Get the Cylons off the streets, let us...

154
00:11:41,664 --> 00:11:44,172
- police our own.
- They're frakking idiots.

155
00:11:44,607 --> 00:11:45,943
What did they expect ?

156
00:11:48,733 --> 00:11:51,063
You don't know
any of those guys, do you ? Any names ?

157
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:52,719
Names ? No.

158
00:11:53,314 --> 00:11:54,688
No idea.

159
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:56,870
- Damn.
- Well,

160
00:11:56,994 --> 00:11:59,644
what's up with Cally ?
Why did they put her in detention ?

161
00:12:00,023 --> 00:12:01,142
I don't know.

162
00:12:01,215 --> 00:12:03,628
She hasn't done a gods damn thing.
I just talked to Gaeta.

163
00:12:03,685 --> 00:12:06,176
Says he doesn't know squat.
Or so he says.

164
00:12:06,739 --> 00:12:09,935
- Gaeta's a good guy. If he knows something
- He's a frakking collaborator.

165
00:12:09,965 --> 00:12:12,561
You know what ?
One day when this is all over,

166
00:12:12,655 --> 00:12:14,677
guys like Gaeta are gonna get strung up.

167
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:18,745
And guys like you and me,
we're gonna be there tying the knots.

168
00:12:19,374 --> 00:12:20,876
Making them tight.

169
00:12:35,137 --> 00:12:37,329
It's been a couple of ugly days.

170
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:40,064
I know you don't care about that, but...

171
00:12:41,298 --> 00:12:43,725
life means something to us, so

172
00:12:44,489 --> 00:12:49,147
I've decided to show you
just how precious life can be.

173
00:12:49,444 --> 00:12:51,860
How even in the worst of times

174
00:12:52,645 --> 00:12:54,889
it can restore your faith.

175
00:12:57,302 --> 00:13:00,046
Remember that breeding farm on Caprica ?

176
00:13:01,757 --> 00:13:04,006
I remember I blew the frak out of the place.

177
00:13:04,308 --> 00:13:05,948
It wasn't a total loss.

178
00:13:06,498 --> 00:13:09,029
We were able to salvage certain things.

179
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:11,394
Certain medical samples.

180
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:14,165
Like your ovary.

181
00:13:32,701 --> 00:13:33,933
What's that ?

182
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:56,119
This is Kacey.

183
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:00,894
Kacey, this is Kara.

184
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,295
Your mother.

185
00:14:04,525 --> 00:14:05,432
Hi.

186
00:14:06,915 --> 00:14:08,033
Good girl.

187
00:14:15,377 --> 00:14:16,599
Unbelievable.

188
00:14:20,403 --> 00:14:21,276
What ?

189
00:14:21,313 --> 00:14:23,550
Admiral's decided to put
some boots on the ground.

190
00:14:23,632 --> 00:14:25,422
Wants to send an officer as a liaison

191
00:14:25,466 --> 00:14:28,912
between us and the resistance elements
on the planet to coordinate the rescue op.

192
00:14:29,303 --> 00:14:32,486
- Makes sense. What's the problem ?
- It's who he's sending.

193
00:14:35,828 --> 00:14:38,889
- He's frakking kidding with this, right ?
- I wish he were.

194
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,241
Mr. Hoshi,

195
00:14:41,275 --> 00:14:44,132
I want a Raptor prepped and
ready in five minutes on the hangar deck.

196
00:14:44,185 --> 00:14:47,511
Inform the flagship I'm coming aboard.
I want a private meeting with the Admiral.

197
00:14:47,894 --> 00:14:49,317
What are you gonna do ?

198
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:51,372
What I should have done a long time ago.

199
00:14:55,219 --> 00:14:57,436
You can't do this. She's a cylon

200
00:14:57,588 --> 00:15:00,014
- Well, I trust her.
- Well, that's a mistake.

201
00:15:01,053 --> 00:15:02,992
Well, it'll be my mistake, won't it ?

202
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:06,166
You are gambling
with the lives of everyone on this ship.

203
00:15:06,318 --> 00:15:07,593
And everyone on my ship.

204
00:15:07,994 --> 00:15:10,086
I don't need a lecture from you

205
00:15:10,322 --> 00:15:12,650
about the responsibilities of command.

206
00:15:13,522 --> 00:15:14,797
We're done here.

207
00:15:18,773 --> 00:15:22,257
I'm not finished.
This entire plan is a reckless gamble.

208
00:15:22,937 --> 00:15:25,174
Yes, you certainly
have the right to risk the lives

209
00:15:25,244 --> 00:15:27,059
of the men and women
under your command but

210
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:31,066
that's not the issue. The issue is that you
are risking the lives of the entire human race.

211
00:15:31,101 --> 00:15:32,835
I'm trying to save the human race.

212
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:36,464
No. No, you're not. That's what you're
not seeing. Right now, the human race ?

213
00:15:36,718 --> 00:15:39,272
Well, that's the 2 000 people
huddled in those civilian ships

214
00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:41,459
that managed to get away
when the Cylons came back.

215
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:42,751
They're the safe bet.

216
00:15:42,789 --> 00:15:44,800
They're the ones whose survival
we should guard.

217
00:15:44,852 --> 00:15:46,946
Just like we did after
the attack on the Colonies.

218
00:15:47,016 --> 00:15:50,217
Sharon can penetrate the cylon defenses.

219
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:53,495
- It's not about her.
- The centurions can't distinguish her

220
00:15:53,533 --> 00:15:55,922
from the other humanoid models.
Did you know that ?

221
00:15:55,991 --> 00:15:58,382
- Admiral.
- They were deliberately programmed that way.

222
00:15:58,435 --> 00:16:01,247
The Cylons
didn't want them becoming self-aware

223
00:16:01,342 --> 00:16:03,387
and suddenly resisting orders.

224
00:16:04,227 --> 00:16:07,018
They didn't want their own
robotic rebellion on their hands.

225
00:16:07,226 --> 00:16:08,710
Should appreciate the irony.

226
00:16:08,933 --> 00:16:11,063
- Dad.
- I know what you're saying.

227
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,693
But we have a responsibility
to the people that we left behind.

228
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,058
Remember what Roslin said.

229
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:22,882
Our first responsibility is
to the survival of humanity.

230
00:16:23,912 --> 00:16:25,590
We can't lose sight of that.

231
00:16:28,161 --> 00:16:29,960
Over the last year, we've...

232
00:16:31,142 --> 00:16:32,551
lost sight

233
00:16:32,952 --> 00:16:34,664
of almost everything.

234
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:36,486
We got...

235
00:16:37,723 --> 00:16:38,995
soft.

236
00:16:41,439 --> 00:16:44,030
But if we go back to New Caprica now,

237
00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:46,782
and we lose,

238
00:16:47,999 --> 00:16:49,373
it's over.

239
00:16:50,107 --> 00:16:52,101
Humanity just stops.

240
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:56,071
And admiral stars don't give you
the right to make that gamble.

241
00:17:02,928 --> 00:17:04,436
You're right, son.

242
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:10,487
You should make plans
to resume the search for Earth

243
00:17:10,557 --> 00:17:12,671
with the Pegasus and the civilian fleet.

244
00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:16,431
- With Pegasus ? What about Galactica ?
- I know why we left those people behind.

245
00:17:17,762 --> 00:17:21,888
And I know it was their choice
in the first place to be down there.

246
00:17:21,978 --> 00:17:23,458
And I realize,

247
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,253
that the survival of the human race

248
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,204
outweighs anything else.

249
00:17:28,733 --> 00:17:29,987
But this time...

250
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:34,566
I can't live with it.

251
00:17:35,571 --> 00:17:37,432
Can't face it.

252
00:17:39,506 --> 00:17:41,297
Maybe I'm a coward.

253
00:17:42,385 --> 00:17:44,580
- But I'm going back.
- Dad, you won't have a chance.

254
00:17:44,888 --> 00:17:46,413
I'm going back, son.

255
00:17:59,488 --> 00:18:02,544
Once I fertilized your egg,
we transferred it to a human woman

256
00:18:02,557 --> 00:18:03,717
who carried it to term.

257
00:18:05,806 --> 00:18:07,835
She is pretty, funny.

258
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:10,635
Great smile.

259
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:12,037
You would've liked her.

260
00:18:12,533 --> 00:18:14,629
Although her birth mother
died during childbirth,

261
00:18:14,781 --> 00:18:16,436
Kacey's heart never faltered.

262
00:18:17,176 --> 00:18:19,701
I guess she gets that will to live from you.

263
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:23,039
I've seen her path.

264
00:18:25,732 --> 00:18:26,970
It's difficult,

265
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:28,856
but rewarding.

266
00:18:29,244 --> 00:18:33,092
She'll know the mind of God in this lifetime.
She'll see patterns that others do not see.

267
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,645
She probably got such
spiritual clarity from me.

268
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,176
She'll be hungry soon.

269
00:18:45,228 --> 00:18:46,862
There's food on the table.

270
00:18:50,741 --> 00:18:52,765
You wouldn't let
your own child starve, would you ?

271
00:18:52,812 --> 00:18:54,014
It's not my child.

272
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,825
- I don't even know if it's human.
- Half-human.

273
00:18:57,215 --> 00:19:00,428
And you know that she's yours.
You just won't admit it.

274
00:19:02,034 --> 00:19:03,505
Where the frak you going ?

275
00:19:04,741 --> 00:19:05,955
Take this with you.

276
00:19:09,067 --> 00:19:11,010
Don't leave me alone with this.

277
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:12,926
Frak.

278
00:19:15,907 --> 00:19:18,688
I don't know who or what you are,
but I do know this.

279
00:19:19,665 --> 00:19:21,327
I'm not your mother.

280
00:19:22,726 --> 00:19:25,748
I don't care that it's effective.
I don't care

281
00:19:26,269 --> 00:19:28,623
that the Cylons can't stop it.
It's wrong.

282
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,945
No more suicide bombings, Colonel.

283
00:19:33,296 --> 00:19:36,107
- You understand ?
- What, are you working for the cylons now ?

284
00:19:43,211 --> 00:19:45,281
I'm sorry.
There's no excuse for that.

285
00:19:48,008 --> 00:19:48,903
You see,

286
00:19:49,699 --> 00:19:52,106
little things like that,
they don't matter anymore.

287
00:19:52,294 --> 00:19:55,088
In fact, not too frakking
much really matters anymore.

288
00:19:55,673 --> 00:19:58,628
I've got one job here, Lady,
and one job only.

289
00:19:58,673 --> 00:20:00,529
To disrupt the Cylons.

290
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,670
Make them worry about the anthill
they've stirred up down here

291
00:20:03,752 --> 00:20:08,081
so they're distracted and out of position
when the old man shows up in orbit.

292
00:20:08,837 --> 00:20:11,596
The bombings ?
They got the cylons' attention.

293
00:20:11,699 --> 00:20:15,640
They really got their attention,
and I am not giving that up.

294
00:20:15,934 --> 00:20:19,596
We are talking about
people blowing themselves up.

295
00:20:20,603 --> 00:20:21,698
You know,

296
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,960
sometimes I think that you've got
ice water in those veins,

297
00:20:25,964 --> 00:20:29,320
and other times I think
you're just a naive little schoolteacher.

298
00:20:30,568 --> 00:20:33,751
I've sent men
on suicide missions in two wars now

299
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:35,337
and let me tell you something.

300
00:20:35,899 --> 00:20:38,010
It don't make a godsdamn
bit of difference

301
00:20:38,022 --> 00:20:41,241
whether they're riding in a Viper
or walking out onto a parade ground.

302
00:20:41,251 --> 00:20:42,801
In the end, they're just as dead.

303
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:49,776
So take your piety and

304
00:20:49,809 --> 00:20:52,927
your moralizing and
your high-minded principles

305
00:20:52,942 --> 00:20:56,410
and stick'em someplace safe
until you're off this rock

306
00:20:56,435 --> 00:21:00,076
and you're sitting
in your nice cushy chair on Colonial One again.

307
00:21:02,586 --> 00:21:04,425
I've got a war to fight.

308
00:21:05,184 --> 00:21:06,717
<i>Let's go move in !</i>

309
00:21:07,604 --> 00:21:09,191
<i>This way !
Off road, the rest.</i>

310
00:21:09,239 --> 00:21:10,844
<i>Let's go to isolation. Move !</i>

311
00:21:10,944 --> 00:21:13,642
The detentions are just causing
more resentment and more enemies.

312
00:21:13,978 --> 00:21:15,470
We're losing ground with the people.

313
00:21:15,972 --> 00:21:18,029
- I know.
- We don't have another option.

314
00:21:18,058 --> 00:21:21,314
We have to send the message
that suicide bombings won't be tolerated.

315
00:21:21,334 --> 00:21:22,385
Excuse me, sir.

316
00:21:23,621 --> 00:21:25,151
Can I talk to you for a moment ?

317
00:21:25,471 --> 00:21:27,675
Yeah, sure, Jammer.
I'll catch up with you.

318
00:21:30,417 --> 00:21:32,861
Sir, I don't know exactly how to broach this.

319
00:21:33,468 --> 00:21:36,754
Nor do I know exactly what
I expect you to do about it.

320
00:21:37,224 --> 00:21:40,198
But, I thought, you know,
since we were

321
00:21:40,456 --> 00:21:42,697
anyway, since we were
back on the Galactica...

322
00:21:42,753 --> 00:21:44,163
Yeah, Jammer, just spit it out.

323
00:21:44,509 --> 00:21:47,377
We picked up
Chief Tyrol's wife in the last raid, Cally.

324
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:50,295
She's in detention.
I think she's on a list.

325
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,054
Frak !

326
00:23:14,453 --> 00:23:15,404
Kacey ?

327
00:23:29,251 --> 00:23:30,220
Kara ?

328
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,896
Hi, Cally. It's me, Boomer.

329
00:24:14,367 --> 00:24:16,041
I wish I had a gun.

330
00:24:21,118 --> 00:24:22,339
Are you all right ?

331
00:24:23,239 --> 00:24:24,313
Physically, I mean.

332
00:24:25,345 --> 00:24:26,820
What do you want from me ?

333
00:24:35,236 --> 00:24:36,363
Look,

334
00:24:36,484 --> 00:24:37,951
a lot's happened,

335
00:24:38,609 --> 00:24:39,831
in everyone's life.

336
00:24:40,207 --> 00:24:42,476
But I want you to know,
I want you and Galen to know

337
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:44,640
that I'm happy for you.

338
00:24:46,495 --> 00:24:48,704
Especially since you started a family.

339
00:24:50,325 --> 00:24:52,677
Something that him and I
talked about once before.

340
00:24:57,406 --> 00:24:59,160
Can you get me out of here ?

341
00:25:01,155 --> 00:25:04,488
I don't know. I have nothing
to do with internal security

342
00:25:04,555 --> 00:25:06,324
Then frak you, Sharon,

343
00:25:06,331 --> 00:25:08,866
you stupid fraked-up toaster.

344
00:25:09,193 --> 00:25:11,093
How many times
do I have to shoot you, anyway ?

345
00:25:11,546 --> 00:25:14,480
If you can't help me,
then just go away

346
00:25:14,841 --> 00:25:16,730
and leave us alone !

347
00:25:30,213 --> 00:25:31,561
<i>All human personnel,</i>

348
00:25:31,683 --> 00:25:33,192
<i>prepare to present identification</i>

349
00:25:33,295 --> 00:25:35,861
<i>before passing through
security scanners.</i>

350
00:25:36,339 --> 00:25:37,460
Have your IDs out.

351
00:25:38,207 --> 00:25:41,484
<i>Keep coming.
Everyone have their work IDs ready.</i>

352
00:25:42,719 --> 00:25:44,302
<i>Work IDs out.</i>

353
00:25:45,952 --> 00:25:46,952
Hey you !

354
00:25:47,018 --> 00:25:48,205
Open your bag.

355
00:25:48,404 --> 00:25:50,078
Open your bag.

356
00:25:53,525 --> 00:25:54,525
Stop her !

357
00:26:01,721 --> 00:26:03,678
23 cylons critically wounded.

358
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:06,281
14 had to be euthanized.

359
00:26:07,997 --> 00:26:09,656
They had casualties too.

360
00:26:09,977 --> 00:26:11,127
Four human dead.

361
00:26:11,325 --> 00:26:13,983
Who gives a frak about that ?
Pardon my language.

362
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,603
The power substation was crippled.

363
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:21,723
Almost half the city's without power, and our
best estimates put the repairs at two weeks.

364
00:26:21,782 --> 00:26:24,444
Do you still think we're being too hard
on the human population ?

365
00:26:24,537 --> 00:26:27,815
We have a very serious,
very straightforward problem.

366
00:26:27,969 --> 00:26:31,260
Either we increase control
or we lose control.

367
00:26:31,325 --> 00:26:32,475
That's a fact.

368
00:26:32,654 --> 00:26:35,032
We think it's time
for stronger measures.

369
00:26:35,162 --> 00:26:36,368
We agree.

370
00:26:37,647 --> 00:26:38,857
We agree.

371
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:43,796
We agree as well.
How about you ?

372
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,954
We agree also.

373
00:26:48,317 --> 00:26:49,882
Most of us do, anyway.

374
00:26:52,305 --> 00:26:53,587
Enough.

375
00:26:58,961 --> 00:27:00,187
What's this ?

376
00:27:00,242 --> 00:27:03,635
This orders the summary executions of
all the detainees listed on the next page.

377
00:27:03,692 --> 00:27:06,022
- It requires your signature.
- My signature ?

378
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:07,819
You're the President.

379
00:27:15,205 --> 00:27:16,911
Read it later. Sign now.

380
00:27:23,922 --> 00:27:25,704
Just because you've
decided to do this

381
00:27:25,732 --> 00:27:28,088
doesn't mean you need to
drag him into sin with you.

382
00:27:28,258 --> 00:27:29,973
Don't you lecture me about sin.

383
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:33,642
I'm not the one who committed the first act
of cylon on cylon violence in our history.

384
00:27:33,802 --> 00:27:34,941
What's she talking about ?

385
00:27:35,072 --> 00:27:37,470
She crushed my head in
with a rock back on Caprica.

386
00:27:37,668 --> 00:27:39,280
Interesting she didn't tell you.

387
00:27:39,431 --> 00:27:41,785
It's something I had to do.
I'm not proud of it.

388
00:27:41,834 --> 00:27:43,436
This is all very interesting.

389
00:27:43,653 --> 00:27:45,642
Very edifying.
Sign the order.

390
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:48,491
- You don't need my signature.
- Well, actually, we do.

391
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:51,633
We're here as allies and friends
of the legitimate government of the Colonies.

392
00:27:51,671 --> 00:27:54,388
You're the President, so everything
we do requires your signature.

393
00:27:54,417 --> 00:27:57,936
In other words they're worried about what
"God" might think if they commit murder.

394
00:27:57,971 --> 00:28:00,130
They're covering
their existential asses.

395
00:28:03,897 --> 00:28:05,297
I won't do it.

396
00:28:05,337 --> 00:28:06,591
All right, I won't do it.

397
00:28:07,194 --> 00:28:09,870
You're going to have
to salve your consciences some other way.

398
00:28:09,937 --> 00:28:11,587
Then we'll find another president.

399
00:28:15,867 --> 00:28:17,271
Stop this.

400
00:28:22,315 --> 00:28:23,720
This is crazy !

401
00:28:41,741 --> 00:28:43,542
- Dear god.
- She'll be back.

402
00:28:43,749 --> 00:28:46,415
But if he pulls that trigger now, you won't.

403
00:28:52,205 --> 00:28:53,308
Sign it.

404
00:28:53,619 --> 00:28:54,627
Sign it !

405
00:28:54,835 --> 00:28:55,967
Sign your name !

406
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,098
Sign it !

407
00:28:58,078 --> 00:28:59,228
Sign it !

408
00:28:59,257 --> 00:29:00,812
there's nothing
you can do, gaius.

409
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,339
<i>- Sign you name on that paper !</i>
- It will be okay.

410
00:29:04,149 --> 00:29:05,450
It's you.

411
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,182
Help me.

412
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,188
You have to sign it.

413
00:29:12,236 --> 00:29:13,584
They'll kill you if you don't.

414
00:29:13,641 --> 00:29:15,667
Sign it ! Sign ! Sign !

415
00:29:16,266 --> 00:29:17,968
Sign your name ! Sign it !

416
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:19,514
I can't.

417
00:29:20,061 --> 00:29:21,559
I won't.

418
00:29:22,445 --> 00:29:24,048
You can't force...

419
00:29:25,027 --> 00:29:26,876
sometimes you have to do things you hate

420
00:29:27,121 --> 00:29:29,685
so you can survive to fight another day.

421
00:30:01,532 --> 00:30:03,983
Raise your right hand and repeat after me.

422
00:30:04,941 --> 00:30:06,548
I, Sharon Agathon...

423
00:30:06,877 --> 00:30:08,386
I, Sharon Agathon...

424
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:10,799
do now pledge my faith and my loyalty...

425
00:30:11,045 --> 00:30:13,090
do now pledge my faith and my loyalty...

426
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:15,824
to the protection
of the 12 Colonies of Kobol.

427
00:30:16,059 --> 00:30:18,604
to the protection
of the 12 Colonies of Kobol.

428
00:30:19,674 --> 00:30:21,126
and will carry out

429
00:30:21,324 --> 00:30:23,228
the lawful orders of my superiors...

430
00:30:23,407 --> 00:30:26,207
and will carry out
the lawful orders of my superiors...

431
00:30:26,726 --> 00:30:29,158
- as an officer...
- as an officer...

432
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:31,034
in the colonial fleet.

433
00:30:31,161 --> 00:30:32,665
in the colonial fleet.

434
00:30:34,209 --> 00:30:35,964
Congratulations, Lieutenant.

435
00:30:39,075 --> 00:30:40,979
Never thought I'd live to see the day.

436
00:30:41,394 --> 00:30:42,836
Me neither.

437
00:30:44,278 --> 00:30:45,786
Looks good on you.

438
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:47,879
Belongs on you.

439
00:30:50,509 --> 00:30:52,243
You know what this means to me.

440
00:30:55,572 --> 00:30:57,834
One of the first things
they taught us at the Academy

441
00:30:58,089 --> 00:30:59,795
was that symbols matter.

442
00:31:00,577 --> 00:31:02,368
Uniforms, flags, banners,

443
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:03,905
even mascots.

444
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:06,799
They're like pieces of
your heart you can look at.

445
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:10,842
This uniform...

446
00:31:12,313 --> 00:31:14,102
it means a lot to me, Sharon.

447
00:31:14,762 --> 00:31:16,441
I know it does, Helo.

448
00:31:17,892 --> 00:31:19,598
It means a lot to me, too.

449
00:31:22,237 --> 00:31:23,698
I won't betray it.

450
00:31:31,002 --> 00:31:32,605
We're checks-out, Lieutenant.

451
00:31:33,532 --> 00:31:34,691
Thanks.

452
00:31:37,199 --> 00:31:38,701
Can I ask you a question ?

453
00:31:38,896 --> 00:31:41,696
How do you know ? How do you
really know that you can trust me ?

454
00:31:42,913 --> 00:31:44,119
I don't.

455
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,653
That's what trust is.

456
00:31:51,804 --> 00:31:53,525
Good hunting, Lieutenant.

457
00:32:11,212 --> 00:32:12,919
That was really something.

458
00:32:16,057 --> 00:32:17,575
Thought you might like that.

459
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:21,006
But you didn't do the twist this time.

460
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:24,715
What do you call, that deal you did
right at the end ? What do you call that ?

461
00:32:26,379 --> 00:32:28,029
You mean the swirl.

462
00:32:28,528 --> 00:32:29,744
The swirl...

463
00:32:31,376 --> 00:32:33,026
Boy, that's really something.

464
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:36,486
Well, you said
you wanted something memorable.

465
00:32:38,965 --> 00:32:40,680
How is Saul ?

466
00:32:42,415 --> 00:32:43,518
Fine.

467
00:32:44,217 --> 00:32:46,886
And when's his next meeting
with the insurgents ?

468
00:32:48,608 --> 00:32:51,464
No point in denying it, Ellen.
We know he's their leader.

469
00:32:51,883 --> 00:32:54,085
Why do you think
we let him out of detention ?

470
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:03,436
I thought it was because of the twist.

471
00:33:04,322 --> 00:33:06,463
Well, yes, that too, for sure.

472
00:33:06,774 --> 00:33:09,517
But having the Colonel out
and active with the resistance

473
00:33:09,583 --> 00:33:11,994
presents us with certain advantages.

474
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:17,060
I don't know anything about...

475
00:33:17,117 --> 00:33:19,875
Let's just consider your denials as read,

476
00:33:20,412 --> 00:33:21,515
shall we ?

477
00:33:21,732 --> 00:33:25,324
I want a specific place,
I want a specific time

478
00:33:25,485 --> 00:33:28,840
for a very high level meeting
of the insurgency leadership.

479
00:33:29,255 --> 00:33:30,858
And if I don't get it,

480
00:33:31,566 --> 00:33:33,169
we pick up Saul again.

481
00:33:33,433 --> 00:33:34,837
And this time,

482
00:33:35,186 --> 00:33:36,918
he'll lose more than an eye.

483
00:33:46,507 --> 00:33:49,025
Tomorrow, the Galactica is going to send

484
00:33:49,092 --> 00:33:52,654
two Raptors, several marines,
and a ground liaison officer

485
00:33:52,724 --> 00:33:56,108
is gonna brief us on the rescue mission
and help coordinate our evac plans.

486
00:33:56,178 --> 00:33:58,723
I'll be damned. It's really happening.

487
00:33:58,849 --> 00:34:01,055
Who's the liaison officer ?

488
00:34:02,193 --> 00:34:06,229
- Sharon.
- I hope that's your idea of a joke.

489
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:09,015
Admiral Adama
has given her a uniform and a billet.

490
00:34:09,085 --> 00:34:12,716
She is a serving officer.
Which is more than you can say about us,

491
00:34:12,809 --> 00:34:14,194
technically speaking.

492
00:34:14,356 --> 00:34:17,007
The old man's lost his mind, all right.

493
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:21,922
- Where's the rendez-vous ?
- They left that up to us.

494
00:34:22,051 --> 00:34:24,304
Okay, here's my suggestion.

495
00:34:25,867 --> 00:34:29,985
If they jump into Breeder's canyon
out here in the southern range...

496
00:34:35,439 --> 00:34:36,648
Come.

497
00:34:38,358 --> 00:34:39,637
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

498
00:34:39,742 --> 00:34:40,821
Ellen.

499
00:34:42,417 --> 00:34:44,915
Anyway, like I was saying,
if they jump in here

500
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:48,680
- they won't get picked up on Cylon Dradis.
- That's a long way out there.

501
00:34:48,762 --> 00:34:50,586
A lot of ground to cover by foot.

502
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,394
I realize that. I'm gonna
meet them halfway. Right about here.

503
00:34:53,442 --> 00:34:56,404
There's good cover from the air.
It's pretty isolated.

504
00:34:56,498 --> 00:35:01,366
Gotta be sure. Maybe the most
important meeting we're ever gonna have.

505
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:04,286
Colonel, I'm sure. This is the place.

506
00:35:04,357 --> 00:35:06,492
The Cylons will not find them here.

507
00:35:07,478 --> 00:35:11,243
All right, give me the map.
You got the message memorized ?

508
00:35:11,466 --> 00:35:13,073
All the wireless freqs ?

509
00:35:13,613 --> 00:35:15,587
All right, then give me the message, too.

510
00:35:18,932 --> 00:35:22,028
I'll do that, Saul. Don't get up.

511
00:35:22,357 --> 00:35:23,490
Thanks.

512
00:35:26,157 --> 00:35:29,049
Colonel, I've assembled a team
of about six to eight men and women

513
00:35:29,126 --> 00:35:32,375
about half a dozen times. We have provisions
for a couple of days if we need'em.

514
00:35:32,457 --> 00:35:34,287
We have access to running water.

515
00:35:34,392 --> 00:35:37,490
I know that place
like the back of my hand. This is gonna work.

516
00:35:41,527 --> 00:35:44,237
Gaius ! Gaius !

517
00:35:47,463 --> 00:35:49,328
Did you sign this ?

518
00:35:49,977 --> 00:35:52,863
- Tell me you didn't sign this.
- Not now, mr. Gaeta. I'm very tired.

519
00:35:52,922 --> 00:35:56,077
This is a death warrant.
Have you seen the names on this list ?

520
00:35:56,534 --> 00:35:58,904
Do you have any idea
what they're about to do out there ?

521
00:35:58,962 --> 00:36:00,300
Are you listening to me ?

522
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,658
I didn't have any choice.

523
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:06,095
What the hell's the matter with you ?
There are over 200 names on this list.

524
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,678
Have you even looked at the names ?

525
00:36:07,725 --> 00:36:09,731
- Look at the names, Gaius !
- I've seen them !

526
00:36:13,476 --> 00:36:15,400
I've seen them, all right ?

527
00:36:16,338 --> 00:36:18,438
And there was nothing I could do.

528
00:36:23,022 --> 00:36:25,368
Back to your frakking tents.

529
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:28,226
Everybody back to your tents.

530
00:36:28,426 --> 00:36:30,138
Move, move, move !

531
00:36:30,318 --> 00:36:33,497
And you do triple digits.
You can do that. Let me see...

532
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,490
Laura Roslin ?

533
00:36:36,334 --> 00:36:38,187
Come with us, please.

534
00:36:41,331 --> 00:36:44,463
Killing Tyrol's wife
will only embitter him against us.

535
00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:46,396
He's the head of a labor union.

536
00:36:46,489 --> 00:36:48,736
Let's just be honest
with one another. In your view,

537
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:50,886
you don't think there's
any reason to kill any of them ?

538
00:36:50,921 --> 00:36:52,941
- Right.
- Well, we made a decision.

539
00:36:53,047 --> 00:36:54,279
All of us.

540
00:36:54,349 --> 00:36:56,897
Like when we listened to you
and Caprica 6 when we came here

541
00:36:56,956 --> 00:36:59,810
to start this new and glorious
chapter in cylon-human relations.

542
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,337
This has nothing to do
with whether or not we execute Cally.

543
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:04,725
No one enjoys the thought
of mortal death, Boomer.

544
00:37:04,795 --> 00:37:08,683
But she tried to murder you.
Maybe it's God's justice.

545
00:37:27,906 --> 00:37:30,709
Need a lift, mr. Vice president ?

546
00:37:31,237 --> 00:37:32,663
Guess so.

547
00:37:33,043 --> 00:37:35,554
Haven't seen much of you lately.
Been busy these days ?

548
00:37:35,647 --> 00:37:37,911
Well, not much to do in detention.

549
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,854
How long have you been held ?

550
00:37:41,209 --> 00:37:43,191
Four months, I think.

551
00:37:43,287 --> 00:37:46,220
I told Baltar I wouldn't have
any part of collaborating with the Cylons.

552
00:37:46,314 --> 00:37:48,546
And he got a little pissed.

553
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:51,127
He's a little pissed at me, too.

554
00:37:58,357 --> 00:38:00,668
Jump complete. Right on target.

555
00:38:00,832 --> 00:38:02,375
Okay, hang on, guys.

556
00:38:02,433 --> 00:38:05,870
I'm dropping down to the landing point
and there's some heavy turbulence up ahead.

557
00:38:12,998 --> 00:38:15,590
Follow the river.
Make sure you hug the bank.

558
00:38:37,322 --> 00:38:40,642
Okay, once we reach the rendez-vous point,
stay back and provide cover.

559
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:49,739
Go, panthers !

560
00:38:51,474 --> 00:38:53,480
C-bucks rule !

561
00:39:15,738 --> 00:39:19,135
Hey, Sam. Been a long time.

562
00:39:19,203 --> 00:39:21,802
Funny. I feel like I see you every day.

563
00:39:25,097 --> 00:39:26,294
Come on.

564
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:49,314
Lords...

565
00:39:50,792 --> 00:39:53,115
Please don't take her life.

566
00:39:53,748 --> 00:39:57,009
It was my mistake. Don't punish her for it.

567
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:03,252
It was an accident, Kara. Nothing more.

568
00:40:13,571 --> 00:40:15,178
Kacey ?

569
00:40:16,903 --> 00:40:19,483
Kacey, oh, my Gods.

570
00:40:20,262 --> 00:40:21,671
Honey.

571
00:40:55,416 --> 00:40:57,891
Let them stretch their legs for a minute.

572
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:59,158
Yes, sir.

573
00:41:01,931 --> 00:41:04,319
Let's go. All right, everybody out !

574
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:06,791
Five minute rest break ! Come on, move !

575
00:41:07,085 --> 00:41:10,698
Everybody out ! Five minute rest break !

576
00:41:12,164 --> 00:41:15,143
Come on, 5 minutes ! Everyone out, let's go !

577
00:41:25,707 --> 00:41:27,768
Tell me something, Laura.

578
00:41:28,272 --> 00:41:30,231
Last year ?

579
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:33,070
You tried to steal the election, didn't you ?

580
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:36,577
Yes, I did, Tom.

581
00:41:43,188 --> 00:41:46,824
- I wish you'd gone through with it.
- Me too.

582
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,689
We'll wait until nightfall
before we go back to the city.

583
00:41:51,795 --> 00:41:54,598
There's a system of tunnels
we've been using...

584
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:57,154
Did you hear that ?

585
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,165
Get down !

586
00:42:02,528 --> 00:42:04,663
Move ! Take cover !

587
00:42:04,745 --> 00:42:06,986
Go !

588
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:14,136
You. Over here.

589
00:42:23,063 --> 00:42:25,139
Run. Run.

590
00:42:25,198 --> 00:42:27,215
Don't look back. Go !

591
00:43:00,207 --> 00:43:04,892
