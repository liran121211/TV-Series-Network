00:00:24,703 --> 00:00:27,277
Previously on Battlestar Galactica...

2
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:30,656
We haven't been properly introduced.
I'm Leoben.

3
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,408
I'm looking forward to spending
more time with you, Starbuck.

4
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,665
We have a lot to talk about !
It's gonna be fun.

5
00:00:36,883 --> 00:00:38,622
Congratulations, Commander.

6
00:00:38,703 --> 00:00:41,416
The Pegasus is your command.

7
00:00:44,097 --> 00:00:46,438
I am picking up a large planetary body.

8
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,119
It's habitable.

9
00:00:48,167 --> 00:00:50,717
We may have just found a world
that can support human life.

10
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:55,180
I know in my gut that settling on this
planet's gonna mean disaster for humanity,

11
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:58,008
and I will not say otherwise
just to win an election.

12
00:00:58,073 --> 00:01:00,978
I take the office of president
of the twelve Colonies of Kobol

13
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,438
and I'm going
to sign my first executive order.

14
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,066
Requiring to immediately
establish settlements

15
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:08,318
on the planet we have come to know

16
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,028
as New Caprica.

17
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,531
If you want to move down there, go ahead.
Be my guest.

18
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,908
Go down and cat around with all the men.

19
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,405
Saul, I want you.

20
00:01:17,471 --> 00:01:20,330
<i>At last, a safe haven we can call home.</i>

21
00:01:24,973 --> 00:01:26,676
Oh, my Gods.

22
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:29,756
It's a cylon fleet, they found us.

23
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,258
<i>We have to get out of here, sir.</i>

24
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,302
We can't just leave all those people behind.

25
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,761
There's nothing we can do.

26
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,388
<i>We're in no shape for a fight, sir.</i>

27
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,096
<i>- They'll be wiped out.
- We don't have a choice.</i>

28
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:41,612
<i>We need to get out of here right now !</i>

29
00:01:41,669 --> 00:01:43,812
<i>Begin jump prep. We're leaving.

30
00:01:45,124 --> 00:01:46,273
But we'll be back.

31
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:49,610
Cylons just jumped into orbit
and the fleet's jumped away.

32
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:51,206
They've left us.

33
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,989
On behalf of the people of
the twelve Colonies...

34
00:01:56,081 --> 00:01:57,226
I surrender.

35
00:01:58,184 --> 00:01:59,912
I'm looking for Kara Thrace.

{\a6}Do you know that every time
they take you out of this cell,

44
00:06:00,665 --> 00:06:02,268
we come in here and we

45
00:06:02,324 --> 00:06:06,742
change those little hash marks on your
little calendar there you're trying to hide.

46
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:14,125
{\a6}Potatoes, gravy.

47
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:16,043
{\a6}Even some carrots.

48
00:06:40,264 --> 00:06:43,325
Heavenly father, we thank you
for the bounty of this table.

49
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:44,940
{\a6}Yes.

50
00:06:45,794 --> 00:06:47,074
{\a6}Yes.

51
00:06:48,343 --> 00:06:50,327
Come on !
Don't stop.

52
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:51,952
Come on !

53
00:06:52,018 --> 00:06:53,360
Come on !

54
00:06:53,426 --> 00:06:56,666
{\a6}You son of a bitch ! Son of a bitch !

55
00:07:01,716 --> 00:07:02,777
Baby !

56
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,313
{\a6}Oh, boy.

57
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,279
All right, we're armed.

58
00:07:27,563 --> 00:07:29,157
They're inbound. Let's move !

59
00:07:52,698 --> 00:07:54,850
I need a knife.

60
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,410
Thank you.

61
00:08:17,412 --> 00:08:18,832
You're welcome.

62
00:08:28,011 --> 00:08:31,136
I must say I quite enjoyed that.

63
00:08:32,538 --> 00:08:34,264
{\a6}I'm so glad.

64
00:08:37,815 --> 00:08:39,684
And...

65
00:08:39,806 --> 00:08:41,772
when do I get what I want ?

66
00:08:42,704 --> 00:08:45,651
I believe that's happening right now.

67
00:08:56,377 --> 00:08:58,539
We reviewed your case today.

68
00:08:59,481 --> 00:09:04,002
And I must say there was great
disappointment on the review committee.

69
00:09:32,566 --> 00:09:33,577
Come on.

70
00:09:34,804 --> 00:09:37,524
We gotta get you processed.
It'll take an hour or so.

71
00:09:37,684 --> 00:09:39,567
Bureaucracy must be served.

72
00:09:40,444 --> 00:09:43,885
But if you're lucky,
you'll get home by dinner time. Colonel.

73
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:47,293
Come on.

74
00:09:47,771 --> 00:09:50,431
I'm not gonna hold
this door open forever.

75
00:10:00,091 --> 00:10:01,834
<i>Attention New Capricans,</i>

76
00:10:02,091 --> 00:10:04,494
<i>Effective immediately,
potable water will be distributed</i>

77
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,065
<i>residence on even number
on even number days.</i>

78
00:10:08,371 --> 00:10:10,747
<i>and odd number on odd number days.</i>

79
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,323
<i>Rationning will continue
for the five periods remaining.</i>

80
00:10:14,602 --> 00:10:15,403
Saul !

81
00:10:16,921 --> 00:10:18,345
<i>We're all in this together.</i>

82
00:10:18,532 --> 00:10:19,446
Saul !

83
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,324
Oh, thank the Gods.

84
00:10:22,894 --> 00:10:24,452
What did they do to you ?

85
00:10:24,621 --> 00:10:27,261
It's all right, Ellen. I'm out.
That's all that matters.

86
00:10:28,647 --> 00:10:30,278
<i>Attention New Capricans,</i>

87
00:10:31,051 --> 00:10:33,502
<i>Effective immediately...</i>

88
00:10:36,358 --> 00:10:37,984
Well, let's get out of here.

89
00:10:38,703 --> 00:10:39,504
Okay.

90
00:10:56,465 --> 00:10:57,298
Okay.

91
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,286
Ready ? Now !

92
00:11:03,044 --> 00:11:04,393
For frak's sakes...

93
00:11:04,496 --> 00:11:06,975
Come on, come on ! Is that thing
gonna work or what ?!

94
00:11:13,663 --> 00:11:15,119
Worked that time.

95
00:11:15,873 --> 00:11:16,678
Go, go !

96
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:23,382
Frakkin' insurgents.

97
00:11:45,985 --> 00:11:47,107
You look...

98
00:11:48,753 --> 00:11:50,541
so lovely tonight.

99
00:12:21,952 --> 00:12:23,430
I'll see you soon...

100
00:12:23,997 --> 00:12:25,170
Kara.

101
00:12:27,197 --> 00:12:28,602
Take your time.

102
00:13:11,867 --> 00:13:15,676
134th day of the cylon
occupation of New Caprica.

103
00:13:16,647 --> 00:13:18,300
Today is Mars day.

104
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:22,210
Somehow it seems appropriate
to honor the god of war

105
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:25,104
on a day when it feels like perpetual war

106
00:13:25,273 --> 00:13:28,038
is the only realistic prospect for us.

107
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:32,281
We've had no contact with Galactica
since it left four months ago.

108
00:13:32,503 --> 00:13:36,311
But I refuse to believe
that Adama has abandoned us.

109
00:13:36,754 --> 00:13:40,102
Our insurgency has been
striking back against the Cylons

110
00:13:40,234 --> 00:13:42,440
whenever and wherever possible.

111
00:13:42,902 --> 00:13:46,513
Although at times these attacks
seem like futile gestures,

112
00:13:46,682 --> 00:13:49,413
I believe that they are critical to morale,

113
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:52,357
to maintaining some measure of hope.

114
00:13:53,973 --> 00:13:58,278
But in order for the insurgency to have
a more meaningful impact,

115
00:13:58,429 --> 00:14:00,852
we need to strike a high profile target.

116
00:14:01,031 --> 00:14:04,963
It is simply not enough to kill Cylons,
because they don't die.

117
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:09,614
They resurrect themselves,
and they continue to walk among us.

118
00:14:10,457 --> 00:14:12,069
It is horrifying.

119
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:15,679
The cylon occupation authority

120
00:14:15,802 --> 00:14:19,259
continues to exert
complete control over the city,

121
00:14:19,306 --> 00:14:21,299
and we remain at their mercy.

122
00:14:21,572 --> 00:14:25,258
The colonial government
under president Gaius Baltar

123
00:14:25,381 --> 00:14:27,605
functions in name only.

124
00:14:28,548 --> 00:14:31,166
Let's review why we're here, shall we ?

125
00:14:31,575 --> 00:14:35,189
We're supposed to bring
the word of "God" to the people, right ?

126
00:14:35,246 --> 00:14:37,399
To save humanity from damnation

127
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:40,596
by bringing the love of "God"
to these poor benighted people.

128
00:14:40,651 --> 00:14:42,545
We're here because a majority of the cylon

129
00:14:42,571 --> 00:14:45,339
felt that the slaughter of mankind
had been a mistake.

130
00:14:45,365 --> 00:14:47,633
We're here to find a new way
to live in peace.

131
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:51,028
- As God wants us to live.
- And it's been a fun ride so far.

132
00:14:51,085 --> 00:14:53,243
But I want to clarify our objectives.

133
00:14:53,556 --> 00:14:56,165
If we're bringing the word of God,
then it follows

134
00:14:56,335 --> 00:14:59,703
that we should employ
any means necessary to do so.

135
00:14:59,852 --> 00:15:01,257
Yes, fear...

136
00:15:01,512 --> 00:15:03,529
is a key article of faith,
as I understand it.

137
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,584
So perhaps it's time to instill

138
00:15:05,659 --> 00:15:08,553
a little more fear into
the people's hearts and minds.

139
00:15:09,627 --> 00:15:10,683
Let's...

140
00:15:11,216 --> 00:15:12,818
Let's execute Baltar.

141
00:15:13,827 --> 00:15:15,005
What ? What ?!

142
00:15:18,313 --> 00:15:19,392
That's not gonna happen.

143
00:15:19,535 --> 00:15:21,383
Just because he's your favorite toy

144
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:23,966
shouldn't be allowed to intefere
with the larger issues here.

145
00:15:24,305 --> 00:15:27,133
- I think that I have cooperated...
- Gaius is with me.

146
00:15:27,698 --> 00:15:30,677
Anyone who wants to challenge that
will have to deal with me.

147
00:15:31,582 --> 00:15:32,760
Now it doesn't matter.

148
00:15:32,829 --> 00:15:35,306
If we'd killed him at the beginning,
it might have worked.

149
00:15:35,364 --> 00:15:38,776
But now, most humans think of him as a traitor,
and would actually cheer his death.

150
00:15:38,824 --> 00:15:39,879
Fine, fine.

151
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,594
We don't kill Baltar.

152
00:15:41,981 --> 00:15:43,941
We round up the leaders of the insurgency,

153
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,742
and we execute them publicly.

154
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:48,230
We round up at random
groups off the street,

155
00:15:48,286 --> 00:15:50,059
and we execute them publicly.

156
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:52,868
Send a message that
the gloves are coming off.

157
00:15:53,057 --> 00:15:54,687
The insurgency stops now

158
00:15:54,716 --> 00:15:57,655
or else we start reducing
the human population to a more...

159
00:15:57,845 --> 00:15:59,445
... manageable size.

160
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:02,039
I don't know, say, less than 1,000.

161
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:06,130
- We need to stop being butchers.
- The entire point of coming here,

162
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:07,949
was to start a new way of life.

163
00:16:08,063 --> 00:16:11,835
To push past the conflict
that's separated us from humans for so long.

164
00:16:11,974 --> 00:16:15,056
And what has it gotten us ?
It's not like they welcomed us

165
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,300
with... with...

166
00:16:16,762 --> 00:16:18,119
Frak it. Never mind.

167
00:16:18,298 --> 00:16:20,099
You're all living in a fantasy world.

168
00:16:20,502 --> 00:16:22,296
Consider the irony in that.

169
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,520
Delusional machines.

170
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:26,616
What's the universe
gonna come up with next ?

171
00:16:33,497 --> 00:16:35,297
Is it really worth it, Caprica ?

172
00:16:36,598 --> 00:16:38,304
Is the love of that man really worth

173
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,039
possibly losing all of this ?

174
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:42,460
If you ever experienced love,

175
00:16:42,953 --> 00:16:44,405
you wouldn't have to ask.

176
00:16:52,268 --> 00:16:56,150
In recent months, the Cylons have been
recruiting and training humans

177
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:59,384
in an attempt to establish
a human police force.

178
00:17:00,882 --> 00:17:03,642
It is hard to think of
anything more despicable

179
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:06,690
than humans doing
the dirty work of the cylons,

180
00:17:08,604 --> 00:17:11,787
led to believe they were merely taking
the civilian security

181
00:17:11,845 --> 00:17:13,860
out of the hands of the Cylons.

182
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,478
And members of the
human police have since

183
00:17:16,516 --> 00:17:20,169
become an extension of
the cylons' corporeal authority.

184
00:17:20,793 --> 00:17:25,072
And while their names are kept
deeply confidential, there is no question,

185
00:17:25,139 --> 00:17:28,406
some of them
are people we might least expect.

186
00:17:29,871 --> 00:17:33,636
Hundreds of us
have been rounded up by the Cylons,

187
00:17:33,843 --> 00:17:37,908
held in detention, questioned, tortured.

188
00:17:37,978 --> 00:17:41,406
Others have simply vanished.

189
00:17:41,829 --> 00:17:43,547
In recent weeks,

190
00:17:43,641 --> 00:17:47,303
we've been gaining access
to some very important documents

191
00:17:47,382 --> 00:17:51,523
from a source
within Baltar's administration.

192
00:17:51,974 --> 00:17:55,814
No one knows
who this mysterious benefactor is.

193
00:17:55,917 --> 00:18:00,328
But he communicates with the insurgents
by means of a secret signal.

194
00:18:02,385 --> 00:18:06,413
We pray every day for the men and women
who risk their lives to fight the Cylons.

195
00:18:06,483 --> 00:18:08,788
They have everything to lose.

196
00:18:08,953 --> 00:18:11,948
And such little hope of something to gain.

197
00:18:13,366 --> 00:18:14,615
Hey, Jake.

198
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,871
There we go.

199
00:18:55,477 --> 00:18:58,857
Looks like mommy's
gonna get some sleep tonight after all.

200
00:19:04,287 --> 00:19:07,583
Sometimes I hate everything about this place.

201
00:19:08,832 --> 00:19:12,005
Sometimes it's magic.

202
00:19:19,769 --> 00:19:21,450
I gotta go.

203
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,014
I'll be back in a couple hours.

204
00:19:29,008 --> 00:19:31,965
One of these days,
you're just not gonna come back, are you ?

205
00:19:32,942 --> 00:19:35,533
You'll just vanish, and that'll be it.

206
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:38,490
I'll never see you again.

207
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:41,382
Nick will never know his father.

208
00:19:46,382 --> 00:19:48,504
Couple hours. I promise.

209
00:20:19,684 --> 00:20:20,660
All right.

210
00:20:32,457 --> 00:20:35,555
- Good to see you, Colonel.
- It's good to be seen.

211
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:46,020
I know you're wondering,
so I'll save you the trouble.

212
00:20:46,565 --> 00:20:48,368
The eye is gone.

213
00:20:48,687 --> 00:20:52,405
Ripped it right out onto the floor.
Picked it up and showed it to me.

214
00:20:53,006 --> 00:20:55,297
Looked like a hard-boiled egg.

215
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:01,710
Big boom today.

216
00:21:03,579 --> 00:21:05,907
- Hope that was you two.
- Oh, yeah.

217
00:21:06,048 --> 00:21:08,681
- Heavy Raider too.
- Good men.

218
00:21:08,841 --> 00:21:11,939
- What's our next target ?
- Well, got these today.

219
00:21:12,014 --> 00:21:16,268
They're security plans for the graduation
ceremony at the New Caprica police academy.

220
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:19,387
These are from the ministry files.
Where are you getting this stuff ?

221
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,719
- Who's your source ?
- I have no idea.

222
00:21:21,801 --> 00:21:23,997
Source won't tell me what their name is.

223
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:27,565
It's probably safer for all of us.
We've been getting stuff like this for weeks.

224
00:21:27,678 --> 00:21:30,800
Humans working for the Cylons.
Makes you wanna puke.

225
00:21:31,053 --> 00:21:35,194
Yeah, well, all the top occupation brass
is gonna be at the graduation even...

226
00:21:35,589 --> 00:21:37,391
President Baltar.

227
00:21:37,476 --> 00:21:39,767
- Gaius Baltar ?
- Yes, sir.

228
00:21:39,863 --> 00:21:41,365
I think we can get a shot at him too.

229
00:21:41,403 --> 00:21:43,694
But it's gonna be tough
avoiding human casualties.

230
00:21:43,741 --> 00:21:46,191
Don't avoid 'em. Send a message.

231
00:21:46,266 --> 00:21:48,548
You work with the Cylons, you're a target.

232
00:21:48,616 --> 00:21:51,715
No boundaries for the Cylons.
There's no boundaries for us !

233
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:54,550
Anything we can do
to nail that son of a bitch,

234
00:21:54,635 --> 00:21:57,236
Gaius Baltar, is worth doing.

235
00:22:03,627 --> 00:22:05,570
Where are we on the wireless ?

236
00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:06,772
Nowhere.

237
00:22:06,838 --> 00:22:09,063
Every day, we try and contact the Raptor,

238
00:22:09,148 --> 00:22:12,228
and every day
the Cylons jam the transmission.

239
00:22:12,312 --> 00:22:14,338
I've asked for the inside source to tell us

240
00:22:14,404 --> 00:22:17,841
which of the cylon jamming frequencies
are the weakest, but so far, I got nothing.

241
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,750
You guys are dreaming.

242
00:22:19,863 --> 00:22:21,938
There's no Raptor there, okay ?

243
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:25,424
There hasn't been one
for the past four months, either.

244
00:22:26,016 --> 00:22:28,476
Galactica's not coming back.

245
00:22:28,569 --> 00:22:30,494
They're not. Accept it.

246
00:22:30,569 --> 00:22:32,372
Watch your frakkin' mouth.

247
00:22:33,146 --> 00:22:36,460
There's a Raptor out there every day,
listening for a wireless call.

248
00:22:36,526 --> 00:22:39,719
It's out there because
that was the plan if anything happened.

249
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:44,179
And it's out there because the old man
isn't just gonna leave us to the Cylons.

250
00:22:44,394 --> 00:22:47,436
The old man left me to the Cylons, Colonel.

251
00:22:47,511 --> 00:22:50,619
And if it wasn't for my wife
being a royal pain in the ass,

252
00:22:50,685 --> 00:22:54,506
and refusing to let it go,
I would be dead a year now.

253
00:23:04,112 --> 00:23:06,056
Any word on Kara ?

254
00:23:09,035 --> 00:23:11,842
Nothing in four months.

255
00:23:30,087 --> 00:23:32,735
Hi, honey. I'm home.

256
00:23:36,547 --> 00:23:38,416
You kill me...

257
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:40,551
I download.

258
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:43,725
I come back, we start over.

259
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,561
Five times now.

260
00:24:01,777 --> 00:24:04,002
I'm trying to help you, Kara.

261
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:07,458
I only want you
to see the truth of your life.

262
00:24:07,908 --> 00:24:10,547
The reason why
you suffered and you struggled for so long.

263
00:24:10,592 --> 00:24:14,527
That's why God sent me to you.
That's why God wants us to be together.

264
00:24:16,545 --> 00:24:17,635
You're right.

265
00:24:20,771 --> 00:24:22,198
You're right.

266
00:24:23,398 --> 00:24:25,417
And I hear you. I do.

267
00:24:27,323 --> 00:24:29,070
So thank you.

268
00:24:29,478 --> 00:24:30,897
You're welcome.

269
00:24:35,366 --> 00:24:37,582
Thank you for putting up with me.

270
00:24:40,098 --> 00:24:42,934
- I'm so sorry.
- Put it down, Kara.

271
00:24:48,193 --> 00:24:49,986
Just put it down.

272
00:24:57,971 --> 00:24:59,783
I'm a patient man.

273
00:24:59,924 --> 00:25:02,722
- You're not a man.
- I'm willing to wait.

274
00:25:02,938 --> 00:25:06,201
- You just need more time.
- I don't need more frakking time.

275
00:25:06,657 --> 00:25:07,821
It's never gonna happen.

276
00:25:07,878 --> 00:25:10,516
Of course it's gonna happen.
You're gonna hold me in your arms.

277
00:25:10,598 --> 00:25:14,035
You're gonna embrace me.
You're gonna tell me that you love me.

278
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:16,439
I've seen it.

279
00:25:17,856 --> 00:25:19,528
You're insane.

280
00:25:19,746 --> 00:25:22,114
To know the face of God
is to know madness.

281
00:25:28,014 --> 00:25:29,533
I'm going to bed.

282
00:25:32,633 --> 00:25:34,626
Be nice if you joined me.

283
00:25:42,946 --> 00:25:44,088
Either way,

284
00:25:45,533 --> 00:25:47,752
you'll be spending the night with me.

285
00:25:52,479 --> 00:25:54,736
I do love you, Kara Thrace.

286
00:25:56,936 --> 00:25:58,136
Good night.

287
00:26:26,056 --> 00:26:27,935
Let me out !

288
00:26:28,052 --> 00:26:30,372
Let me out of here !

289
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:34,397
I don't belong here !
Let me out !

290
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:41,270
<i>- Racetrack, adjust your line of 20 degrees.
- Snowbird 3, get information.</i>

291
00:26:41,345 --> 00:26:43,576
<i>Okay, Snowbirds,
let's nail this exercise.</i>

292
00:26:43,651 --> 00:26:45,461
<i>How many times are we gonna
run this thing ?</i>

293
00:26:45,531 --> 00:26:47,226
<i>What, you're not having fun yet ?</i>

294
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,632
<i>Snowbirds, Galactica.</i>

295
00:27:02,674 --> 00:27:05,831
<i>Regroup in deployment formation
and proceed to position one.</i>

296
00:27:05,901 --> 00:27:09,554
Snowbird one to snowbirds.
Drop point in eight seconds.

297
00:27:09,617 --> 00:27:12,299
Okay, snowbirds, let's get
this deployment bang on.

298
00:27:12,388 --> 00:27:14,234
The Admiral's watching every move.

299
00:27:16,188 --> 00:27:17,313
<i>Roger, Kat.</i>

300
00:27:17,627 --> 00:27:20,589
We go on your command.
Bomb bay doors open.

301
00:27:22,631 --> 00:27:26,185
All vipers...
break now, now, now !

302
00:27:27,241 --> 00:27:28,688
<i>Deploy drones on my mark.</i>

303
00:27:29,188 --> 00:27:31,810
Three... two... one. Mark !

304
00:27:35,128 --> 00:27:37,796
<i>Frak me !
Gods damn it, Snowbird four !</i>

305
00:27:37,894 --> 00:27:40,703
<i>What the hell happened ?
Can the chatter, snowbirds !</i>

306
00:27:40,842 --> 00:27:43,544
This is the CAG. Abort maneuver.

307
00:27:43,623 --> 00:27:46,357
I say again, decoy squadron,
abort maneuver.

308
00:27:46,476 --> 00:27:49,039
<i>Roger that, leader.
Snowbirds, fall back.</i>

309
00:27:49,138 --> 00:27:51,483
<i>Abort drill.
Await further instructions.</i>

310
00:27:51,602 --> 00:27:53,346
<i>Roger, get off my wings.</i>

311
00:27:53,908 --> 00:27:56,147
<i>Galactica, Kat.
It is a mess out here.</i>

312
00:27:56,210 --> 00:28:00,588
<i>We got decoy drones heading
every which way. Request instructions.</i>

313
00:28:01,051 --> 00:28:03,070
Roger that, Kat.
Abort acknowledged.

314
00:28:03,233 --> 00:28:05,930
You're approaching bingo fuel anyway.
Bring your birds back home.

315
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:07,798
Belay that.

316
00:28:07,957 --> 00:28:10,910
- Strike my last. Stand by.
- Launch a tanker bird.

317
00:28:10,958 --> 00:28:14,024
Let them practice their in-flight
refueling before they recover the drones.

318
00:28:14,075 --> 00:28:16,539
Have them run the exercise one more time.

319
00:28:17,525 --> 00:28:18,719
Yes, sir.

320
00:28:19,611 --> 00:28:21,371
16 times now, sir.

321
00:28:24,471 --> 00:28:26,596
The next one will be 17, won't it ?

322
00:28:27,212 --> 00:28:28,409
Yes, sir.

323
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,899
Launch the tanker.

324
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,687
All units, Galactica.

325
00:28:32,778 --> 00:28:35,177
<i>Recover drones and prepare
to run training mission again.</i>

326
00:28:35,228 --> 00:28:37,636
<i>- We're launching the tanker bird.</i>
- Tanker ?

327
00:28:37,677 --> 00:28:41,572
<i>Once you've tanked up, head back to position
alpha and prepare for training run 17.</i>

328
00:28:41,671 --> 00:28:43,578
<i>Galactica out.</i>

329
00:28:43,677 --> 00:28:46,340
What the frak are they doing over there ?

330
00:28:47,389 --> 00:28:49,806
This is the Commander.
Get the Admiral on the line.

331
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:56,075
Admiral, considering how long
our pilots have been in the air,

332
00:28:56,137 --> 00:28:58,884
<i>I suggest we recall the birds
and scrub the training exercise.</i>

333
00:28:58,963 --> 00:29:00,917
If we can't do this
in a training scenario,

334
00:29:00,957 --> 00:29:04,878
<i>how the hell are we supposed to pull
this off with cylon raiders on our asses ?!</i>

335
00:29:04,996 --> 00:29:07,678
- Tell me !
- What the frak do you want from me ?

336
00:29:07,726 --> 00:29:10,303
I don't know how we can
do any of this crap at half-strength !

337
00:29:10,345 --> 00:29:12,486
<i>Collision ! We've had a collision.

338
00:29:12,665 --> 00:29:15,498
<i>- Give me your status, Kat.
- Bingo, Molar, speak to me !</i>

339
00:29:15,617 --> 00:29:17,346
<i>I'm losing flight control !</i>

340
00:29:17,644 --> 00:29:19,452
<i>I got red lights all across the board !</i>

341
00:29:19,531 --> 00:29:22,575
<i>Kat, I'm in a lateral spin
and losing hydraulics.</i>

342
00:29:22,616 --> 00:29:24,186
<i>- My wing's clipped.
- Galactica, Kat !</i>

343
00:29:24,227 --> 00:29:27,808
<i>I'm declaring an emergency. Requesting
priority landing for two bent birds.</i>

344
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,687
- Pull 'em in !
- Yes, sir.

345
00:29:29,787 --> 00:29:31,728
Roger that, Kat.
Bring your birds back home.

346
00:29:35,841 --> 00:29:39,488
This whole thing is frakking insane.
We got two ships at half-strength.

347
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:41,986
We got crews that haven't seen
action in a year and a half.

348
00:29:42,047 --> 00:29:45,611
And you're acting like the only problem
is they're not working hard enough.

349
00:29:46,219 --> 00:29:49,199
Have you taken a look at
yourself in the mirror lately ?

350
00:29:50,272 --> 00:29:54,145
You're weak, soft !
Mentally and physically.

351
00:29:54,262 --> 00:29:55,709
This isn't about me.

352
00:29:55,749 --> 00:29:58,317
You've had four months
to get your act together.

353
00:29:59,072 --> 00:30:01,469
And so far, all you've
been able to frakkin' do

354
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,008
is to complain and whine
about how hard it is.

355
00:30:04,108 --> 00:30:06,055
Well, guess what.

356
00:30:06,313 --> 00:30:09,006
It's gonna get a lot harder.
Do you understand me ?

357
00:30:09,492 --> 00:30:12,628
Now I want you to turn around
and get your fat ass out of here.

358
00:30:12,747 --> 00:30:15,959
Get your men ready !
Or I'll find someone who can.

359
00:30:16,082 --> 00:30:17,199
Dismissed !

360
00:30:37,786 --> 00:30:39,574
I don't like this one, Colonel.

361
00:30:40,066 --> 00:30:42,038
I think we're the ones
crossing the line here.

362
00:30:42,118 --> 00:30:44,978
It's the only way it's gonna work.
Kid's got access and clearance.

363
00:30:45,098 --> 00:30:48,132
You gotta be square on this.
You can't back out once you start.

364
00:30:48,291 --> 00:30:49,721
I'm not backing out.

365
00:30:50,869 --> 00:30:53,250
It's wrong, Colonel.
You know that, don't you ?

366
00:30:53,306 --> 00:30:57,461
He's a soldier, Chief. Not the first time
we've sent a soldier on a one-way mission.

367
00:30:57,551 --> 00:30:58,814
You know that, don't you ?

368
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,051
This is different.

369
00:31:01,506 --> 00:31:04,566
This is our best chance
to take out Gaius Baltar.

370
00:31:04,665 --> 00:31:07,963
Maybe the only one.
We're sure as frak gonna take it.

371
00:31:08,082 --> 00:31:10,275
Every since they killed Nora,

372
00:31:11,273 --> 00:31:14,750
- I got nothing to live for.
- All right.

373
00:31:25,352 --> 00:31:28,332
You look me in the eye, and you tell me
that you are committed to this.

374
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:30,645
I'm committed.

375
00:31:37,309 --> 00:31:38,762
May the Gods be with you.

376
00:31:46,267 --> 00:31:49,724
Some things you just don't do, Colonel.
Not even in war.

377
00:31:49,823 --> 00:31:53,372
Well, maybe you'll feel different
when you're sitting in detention.

378
00:31:54,544 --> 00:31:56,530
Duck volunteered, he's going.

379
00:32:13,956 --> 00:32:18,426
It's a hard thing to say, but it seems
like I don't know who my son is anymore.

380
00:32:19,578 --> 00:32:22,154
Same goes for the crew of the ship.

381
00:32:24,239 --> 00:32:26,136
I feel pretty much alone.

382
00:32:26,626 --> 00:32:28,319
Except maybe for you.

383
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:34,556
I wish I could go back a year and tell
that Admiral Adama about this conversation.

384
00:32:34,636 --> 00:32:36,313
A year's a long time.

385
00:32:40,556 --> 00:32:43,725
Can I ask you something ? Very personal.

386
00:32:47,123 --> 00:32:50,719
Do you feel guilty about leaving
the people behind on New Caprica ?

387
00:32:52,729 --> 00:32:54,298
I don't do guilt.

388
00:32:59,058 --> 00:33:00,268
You know...

389
00:33:01,297 --> 00:33:02,933
a year ago...

390
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,506
when you put me in the cell...

391
00:33:05,957 --> 00:33:07,792
I was at a crossroads.

392
00:33:10,515 --> 00:33:12,125
I sat in here for weeks,

393
00:33:12,197 --> 00:33:15,978
just consumed with rage at all
the things that had happened to me.

394
00:33:20,776 --> 00:33:23,843
And at some point,
I realized it was all just guilt.

395
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:28,687
I was angry at myself
for the choices I had made.

396
00:33:30,455 --> 00:33:32,021
Betraying my people.

397
00:33:33,476 --> 00:33:35,142
And losing the baby.

398
00:33:39,707 --> 00:33:41,973
So... I had a choice.

399
00:33:42,873 --> 00:33:45,395
I could either
move forward or stay in the past.

400
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:48,933
But the only way to move forward...

401
00:33:50,212 --> 00:33:51,743
was to forgive myself.

402
00:33:52,494 --> 00:33:55,523
You know, I don't think we can survive.
I don't think...

403
00:33:55,966 --> 00:33:59,508
the fleet or Galactica or
the people on New Caprica

404
00:33:59,697 --> 00:34:01,225
can survive...

405
00:34:02,192 --> 00:34:03,985
unless the man at the top

406
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:08,137
finds a way to forgive himself.

407
00:34:27,811 --> 00:34:31,652
Two of our pilots almost got killed because
they've been in the cockpit for 11 hours.

408
00:34:31,816 --> 00:34:33,817
And he wants to bust my balls.

409
00:34:35,934 --> 00:34:37,104
"You're soft."

410
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,794
Can you believe that ?

411
00:34:41,266 --> 00:34:42,531
What ?

412
00:34:45,546 --> 00:34:47,634
Oh, you agree. Is that it ?

413
00:34:47,906 --> 00:34:50,335
Forget it, I'm not looking for a fight.

414
00:34:50,372 --> 00:34:52,055
Oh, no, no, no, no. Don't do that.

415
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:55,900
You got something to say,
come out and say it.

416
00:34:56,806 --> 00:34:58,421
He's right.

417
00:34:58,524 --> 00:35:00,083
You are soft.

418
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:02,901
I'm not talking about the weight.

419
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,410
You've lost your edge.

420
00:35:06,233 --> 00:35:07,753
Your confidence.

421
00:35:09,867 --> 00:35:11,626
You lost your war, Lee.

422
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,846
And the truth is, you're
a soldier who needs a war.

423
00:35:16,751 --> 00:35:17,936
And you don't wanna hear it,

424
00:35:17,956 --> 00:35:20,911
because you've got it in your head
that your father's the soldier.

425
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:23,075
And you sure don't wanna be like him.

426
00:35:23,623 --> 00:35:25,492
But you are like him.

427
00:35:28,062 --> 00:35:30,052
You're more like him than you know.

428
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:32,846
That's one of the reasons I married you.

429
00:36:03,257 --> 00:36:04,788
Okay, it's working.

430
00:36:05,291 --> 00:36:08,029
- I think.
- Is it working or isn't it ?

431
00:36:08,775 --> 00:36:10,359
They keep jamming us.

432
00:36:10,812 --> 00:36:12,937
So much for our source on the inside.

433
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:26,808
Ten minutes left.

434
00:36:27,554 --> 00:36:30,083
And lots of nothing
on the wireless, as usual.

435
00:36:30,861 --> 00:36:32,574
Keep an eye out for Raiders.

436
00:36:32,947 --> 00:36:35,740
Last listening bird almost
got popped by a pair yesterday.

437
00:36:38,919 --> 00:36:40,249
I almost got it.

438
00:36:42,326 --> 00:36:44,335
Frak ! Turn that thing down !

439
00:36:46,011 --> 00:36:47,533
It's working.

440
00:36:48,283 --> 00:36:49,908
It's working.

441
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:56,749
Time's up.
Spin up the FTL and get ready to go.

442
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:57,499
Hold on.

443
00:36:58,366 --> 00:36:59,752
I'm picking something up.

444
00:37:00,741 --> 00:37:01,891
It's a colonial transmission.

445
00:37:01,898 --> 00:37:03,681
It's a low power signal, but...

446
00:37:03,806 --> 00:37:05,446
the recognition codes match.

447
00:37:05,793 --> 00:37:07,473
Yeah, We got a link to the ground.

448
00:37:09,398 --> 00:37:10,930
Okay, send the coded response.

449
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:13,431
Spin up the drive, and let's get
the hell back to Galactica.

450
00:37:14,433 --> 00:37:15,784
I've got a signal.

451
00:37:16,842 --> 00:37:19,427
- A Raptor just made contact with us.
- What's it say ?

452
00:37:20,717 --> 00:37:24,259
Will make contact
with this frequency every twelve hours.

453
00:37:24,464 --> 00:37:26,206
Prepare sitrep for command authority.

454
00:37:26,447 --> 00:37:28,424
Have hope. We're coming for you.

455
00:37:30,073 --> 00:37:31,533
<i>We made contact.</i>

456
00:37:31,879 --> 00:37:34,022
<i>I say again.
We made contact with the ground.</i>

457
00:37:34,408 --> 00:37:37,414
Colonel Tigh has formed
an insurgent group against the Cylons,

458
00:37:37,558 --> 00:37:41,698
and is waiting for instructions
on how to coordinate the rescue effort.

459
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,683
It's gonna be okay.

460
00:37:48,126 --> 00:37:49,984
It's really gonna be okay.

461
00:38:04,696 --> 00:38:07,541
These are all the surveillance pictures
taken by the insurgents.

462
00:38:07,565 --> 00:38:10,625
I think we can match names
to about 50 of these photos.

463
00:38:11,466 --> 00:38:14,520
But our best guess puts
the total police force at around 200.

464
00:38:15,087 --> 00:38:16,296
Two hundred ?

465
00:38:18,063 --> 00:38:19,862
I wouldn't have believed
there'd be 20 people

466
00:38:19,863 --> 00:38:21,662
who would turn against their own kind.

467
00:38:21,735 --> 00:38:23,746
I want those names.
I want the rest of the names.

468
00:38:24,597 --> 00:38:26,718
That's tough. The Cylons are afraid

469
00:38:26,733 --> 00:38:30,151
the population will go after any human
who joins the New Caprica police.

470
00:38:30,164 --> 00:38:31,114
As well they should.

471
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:54,049
I know I haven't lived a model life.

472
00:38:55,983 --> 00:38:57,670
I made a lot of mistakes.

473
00:39:01,662 --> 00:39:03,814
I'm gonna need your protection today.

474
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:10,046
Mr. President.

475
00:39:10,166 --> 00:39:11,473
Morning, Gaeta.

476
00:39:12,072 --> 00:39:14,192
It's time for the graduation ceremony.

477
00:39:18,233 --> 00:39:19,304
Oh, yes.

478
00:39:21,905 --> 00:39:23,384
The ceremony.

479
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:27,478
About the ceremony...
There's a been a change of plan.

480
00:39:27,636 --> 00:39:28,803
I won't be going.

481
00:39:31,109 --> 00:39:32,860
Security concern.

482
00:39:39,446 --> 00:39:40,895
Don't look so worried.

483
00:39:41,547 --> 00:39:43,548
There'll be other graduations.

484
00:39:44,499 --> 00:39:46,860
Right. Okay.
I'll just...

485
00:39:48,384 --> 00:39:49,858
let the staff know.

486
00:39:57,751 --> 00:39:59,386
I think we should call off the strike.

487
00:39:59,409 --> 00:40:02,392
There's no reason to go forward
if the Galactica's gonna come back.

488
00:40:02,418 --> 00:40:05,937
What, and pass up a golden opportunity
to kill Gaius Baltar ?

489
00:40:06,703 --> 00:40:08,309
Colonel, I fail to see the point.

490
00:40:08,326 --> 00:40:10,326
Think with your head,
Chief, not with your heart.

491
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:13,097
The only way they stand a chance
of getting us off this rock

492
00:40:13,131 --> 00:40:14,993
is if the Cylons are too distracted

493
00:40:14,997 --> 00:40:17,886
battling a full-blown
uprising when they get here.

494
00:40:19,435 --> 00:40:23,612
All right, if your source on the inside
says Baltar's not gonna be there, abort.

495
00:40:23,669 --> 00:40:25,831
Otherwise, stick with the plan.

496
00:41:09,095 --> 00:41:10,397
<i>Baltar not at graduation.</i>

497
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,740
Hey, Duck.

498
00:42:45,627 --> 00:42:46,604
Good morning.

499
00:42:47,294 --> 00:42:49,335
And welcome to all graduates.

500
00:42:50,506 --> 00:42:51,905
You are the hope.

501
00:42:53,121 --> 00:42:57,531
You are the dream of a new tomorrow
for Humans and Cylon alike.

502
00:42:57,983 --> 00:42:59,336
And I salute you

503
00:42:59,904 --> 00:43:03,404
for the risks that you have taken
for just showing up today.

504
00:43:04,462 --> 00:43:06,719
Today, you begin a new career

505
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:10,663
and a new life
as provisional police officers.

506
00:43:11,027 --> 00:43:15,372
And looking out across this room,
I see that the significance of this new path

507
00:43:15,772 --> 00:43:17,820
is not lost on you.

508
00:43:22,096 --> 00:43:23,495
Congratulations,

509
00:43:23,946 --> 00:43:25,706
it's good to have you with us.

510
00:43:26,357 --> 00:43:28,147
Congratulations, Sergeant.

511
00:43:36,922 --> 00:43:38,321
Congratulations, Captain.

512
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:40,057
It's great to have you with us.

513
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:41,936
I'll see you soon, Nora.
