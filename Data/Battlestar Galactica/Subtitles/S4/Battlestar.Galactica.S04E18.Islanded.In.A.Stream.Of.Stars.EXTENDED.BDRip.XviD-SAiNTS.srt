1
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:05,755
Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,174
What am I?
A ghost, a demon...

3
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:10,301
You're asking the wrong guy.
I'm just a piano player.

4
00:00:10,386 --> 00:00:11,427
Is that for me?

5
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:12,553
Yeah.

6
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,347
Holy crap.

7
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:18,976
Sam!

8
00:00:22,106 --> 00:00:23,523
There's a lot
still going on in there.

9
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:27,443
And there's nothing to indicate that
he's having any kind of conscious thought.

10
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:30,363
What if we could link him to
the data stream like our hybrids?

11
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:34,117
We have to figure out a
contingency plan for the ship now.

12
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:38,371
You have to face the fact
that you're gonna lose her.

13
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:40,873
Boomer's loose.
She's got my frakking kid.

14
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:43,668
K-Ro, get on the horn to CIC and alert the Admiral.

15
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,044
Sir,
Boomer's pulling a jump.

16
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:49,465
If she jumps, the space shield disruption
could tear Galactica's guts out.

17
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,925
Hey. Hey. What have you
been bitching about?

18
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,428
It's not our fault the resin won't
bond with these inferior alloys.

19
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:38,806
In other words, it's our fault that
this goop of yours isn't doing crap,

20
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:41,684
except making this place smell
like the inside of a latrine.

21
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:44,103
Really?
I thought that was you.

22
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:47,231
Lady, you work on your
side and I'll work on mine.

23
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:50,443
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Come on. Hey. Come on.

24
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:51,611
Not with this guy.
Not now.

25
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:52,779
Stop your bitching.

26
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:53,946
Not now.

27
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:55,114
Fine. Fine.

28
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:57,033
Come on. Let's go.

29
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:12,131
There's still time
if we go after her now.

30
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:13,925
Admiral, Hera's
our only chance.

31
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,302
The fact is we have no way
of tracking Boomer's Raptor

32
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,513
and we have no way of
knowing where she's going.

33
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:21,307
She'll take her to Cavil.
That much is obvious.

34
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,810
Which Cavil? Where?

35
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:27,980
Could be any one of a thousand
base ships between here and Caprica.

36
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,565
Not just
any base ship.

37
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,819
If John's plan all along was to
steal Hera so he could study her...

38
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:36,322
Study her? They're going to dissect her
like a frakking lab rat, and we all know it.

39
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,324
If he wants to
try to determine

40
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,202
what made her a successful
human-Cylon hybrid,

41
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,496
he'll take her
to the colony.

42
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,456
The colony?

43
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,750
I guess you could
call it "home. "

44
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:51,045
It's where we and the Centurions
went after the first war,

45
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:55,174
once we convinced them to abandon
their own experiments with evolution

46
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:57,969
in exchange for
resurrection technology.

47
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,929
She knows where it is.

48
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:08,396
So you would have the Galactica
jump into a Cylon's hornets' nest,

49
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,816
risk everything for one
solitary, single child.

50
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,150
Is that what you're
telling me, Colonel?

51
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,486
She's not just any child.

52
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,030
With Caprica Six's
miscarriage,

53
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:22,577
Hera is our people's only hope
of avoiding eventual extinction.

54
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,912
She may be our
only hope, too.

55
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,542
I just...

56
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:35,381
We just experienced
something remarkable.

57
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,968
Hera wrote the
notes to a song,

58
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,514
a song that my father used to
play to me when I was a child.

59
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,184
Same song that switched us on
when we were in that nebula.

60
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,479
The same song that
led us to Earth.

61
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,943
Something is happening here, something
that is greater than all of us,

62
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:59,071
and that little girl is
in the middle of it.

63
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:01,073
She's the key, sir.

64
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:06,871
In other words, it's our
destiny to go after her, right?

65
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,714
Wrong.

66
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,425
I've had it up to
here with destiny,

67
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:22,887
prophecy, with God
or the Gods.

68
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,931
Look where it's left us.

69
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,558
The ass end
of nowhere.

70
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,770
Nearly half of
our people are gone.

71
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,773
Earth, a worthless cinder,

72
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:37,360
and I can't even walk down the
halls of my ship without wondering

73
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:40,446
if I'm gonna catch a bullet
for getting us into this mess.

74
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:47,119
We're alive, Bill.

75
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:50,539
Four years ago, I wouldn't
have taken odds on that.

76
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,833
At least give us
a recon bird.

77
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:54,752
We can see what
we're up against.

78
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,890
Make it
a Heavy Raider.

79
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:11,268
I don't want Helo and Athena
to find out about this.

80
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:16,065
Yup.

81
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:30,913
You think I don't know what's
going on in that head of yours?

82
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,545
Look at me.

83
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,010
Look at me.

84
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:47,930
Look at me.

85
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:55,062
You hate me,
don't you?

86
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:58,024
Say it.

87
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,112
Say it.

88
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,370
Gods frakking damn it.

89
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,374
Hera?

90
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:16,959
Hera?

91
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,713
Hera?

92
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:40,149
Bill, I've been having
that dream again.

93
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,159
Move it!

94
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,935
Help me!

95
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,646
Grab him!

96
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,279
Get out!

97
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,370
Grab the door!

98
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,961
Lock it!

99
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,340
Lock it!

100
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:52,114
I need help here. This Eight
needs immediate attention.

101
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,538
She's bleeding internally.
Prep up for surgery, stat.

102
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:01,332
Right away, ma'am.

103
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,920
We've got internal bleeding,
Doc. Taking her to surgery.

104
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:08,505
Right. I hope
we don't lose power.

105
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,965
What's the tally?

106
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,260
Sixty-one dead or missing so
far, including 26 of theirs.

107
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:14,595
Sixty-one?

108
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,721
Yeah.

109
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,598
And I'm afraid
that's just the beginning.

110
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:20,267
The Leobens are calling
it the proverbial straw,

111
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:22,978
say we've got five
more jumps, max.

112
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,397
After that, there's a 90%
chance of tearing her in half...

113
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:28,108
I don't want to hear that
you are 90% sure of anything.

114
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:31,904
You come back when you are
100% sure, you got that?

115
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,280
Go take care
of your injuries.

116
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:34,823
Yes, sir.

117
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:39,912
I know my own ship. Don't need anyone
telling me how much life she has left.

118
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,998
She's seen worse. She'll
come through for us again.

119
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,292
That frakking
Cylon rep, Sonja,

120
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:48,671
wanted to know when you'd
be transferring your flag.

121
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:52,383
Transferring to where? Her Baseship?
That'll be the frakking day.

122
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,218
That's exactly
what I said.

123
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,428
I'll get on top of
this repair detail.

124
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,514
We'll straighten her out.

125
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:03,227
Must be tough, saying goodbye
to both of your women at once.

126
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:11,568
You must feel like
we're abandoning you.

127
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,071
No one's
going anywhere.

128
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,616
And neither one of
my women are dying.

129
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:19,076
Mmm-hmm.

130
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:22,538
They just need a little
more care and attention.

131
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,543
Hera.

132
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:41,640
Admiral Adama will be
forced to abandon Galactica.

133
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,646
Yes.
At which point

134
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:51,859
the Cylon Baseship will be
our sole means of defense.

135
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,861
Under the Admiral's
command,

136
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:58,365
augmented by Galactica's pilots,
planes and military personnel,

137
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,491
as it has always been.

138
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:03,329
Sorry. Mr. Adama,
it sure seems

139
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:06,999
like we're putting a lot of power
into the hands of some people,

140
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,917
and I use the
term loosely,

141
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,795
who not so long ago were doing
their damndest to wipe us out.

142
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,047
And your
concerns are noted.

143
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,883
As you all know... As
you... Let me speak!

144
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:21,013
As you all know, we agreed to accept
Admiral Adama's military authority

145
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,640
in return for a seat
on this council.

146
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:26,185
We intend to abide
by that promise.

147
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:29,813
Speaking of promises, I have
been complaining about air quality

148
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:32,316
aboard Hitei Kan
from day one.

149
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,153
I am submitting
my requisition now

150
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:39,406
for Galactica's CO2
and particulate scrubbers.

151
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:43,202
Excuse me?
As long as we get the FTLs.

152
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:46,080
The last emergency jump, it
took six minutes to spin up.

153
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:47,206
Wait a minute.
Look.

154
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:52,336
Obviously, we will have to do a complete
inventory of Galactica's equipment,

155
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,798
maybe even a lottery in order
to ensure a comparable...

156
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:56,924
Hey!

157
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:59,676
...distribution
of all the equipment.

158
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:02,721
Now listen to me
for one godsdamn minute!

159
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:07,434
No one removes so much as
one bolt from this battlestar,

160
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,896
not until the Admiral
tells us we can!

161
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,481
Really?

162
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,776
What does Gaius Baltar
say about that?

163
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,903
Gaius Baltar?

164
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:21,990
I want to tell you
a secret about myself.

165
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:27,579
Something that I have
belatedly come to understand.

166
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:31,291
You see, I don't believe
that God speaks to us on high

167
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:34,169
through some appointed
human mouthpiece.

168
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,092
But he does speak to us.

169
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:44,304
He speaks to
each one of us directly.

170
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:49,017
In our hearts.
And it's up to us to listen.

171
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:59,945
If you find yourself straying
from the one true path,

172
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:06,160
then perhaps you'll be lucky
enough for God to send you an angel,

173
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:09,371
to steer you
in the right direction.

174
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,166
Angels, I hear you say.

175
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:17,463
I don't believe that angels appear
to you in some mystical spectral form.

176
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:23,469
Angels take the guise of those
who are nearest and dearest to you.

177
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:29,349
Those who can understand
your doubts and your trials,

178
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:33,729
and steer you back on
the road to salvation.

179
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,025
I believe in these angels,

180
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,861
because I see them.

181
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:49,995
Wherever you are
in the fleet,

182
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,456
this is Gaius Baltar
wishing you a beautiful day.

183
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,586
Paulla.

184
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:02,508
Okay, what are
we doing today?

185
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:06,845
Okay, at 10:00, you need to inspect
the new people's medical clinic.

186
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:11,099
At 10:30, Colonel Tigh
would like a meeting.

187
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,185
Colonel Tigh,
always a pleasure.

188
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,562
At 11:00, we have
the funeral.

189
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:21,026
Okay, we... We need to discuss
moving our headquarters off Galactica.

190
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,444
Yeah, the sooner the better.
Yeah.

191
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,821
Now, Captain Meeker has
already offered to host us,

192
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:26,281
which I think
is an excellent idea.

193
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:30,202
But we've also had offers
from Argo Navis and Prometheus.

194
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,871
I didn't realize
we were so popular.

195
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:36,542
Gaius, the whole Fleet's heard
about what we've accomplished here.

196
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:39,545
All of these are requests for
new food distribution centers.

197
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,463
Look at all of them.

198
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,632
Well, who's going to
get us all this?

199
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,510
Well, I mean, you have
to approve them all.

200
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,387
Great.

201
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,516
Grace, unity, life.

202
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,850
Love.

203
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,102
Back at you.

204
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:07,489
It's all coming together
for you, isn't it, Gaius?

205
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:08,574
Is it?

206
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:11,994
You have more power now
than when you were president.

207
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:15,247
With Galactica gone,
you may even eclipse Adama.

208
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:17,749
Oh, I'm truly blessed.

209
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:21,420
I told you if you followed
God's path you'd be rewarded.

210
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:24,965
You've earned it. Now why
don't you let yourself enjoy it?

211
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,509
Yeah, I suppose
you're right.

212
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,850
Excuse me.
She's not the one.

213
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,643
She's the only one.

214
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:39,646
Excuse me,
Caprica. Caprica Six.

215
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,066
Ah.

216
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,652
It's good to...

217
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:51,366
Listen, I heard
about your loss,

218
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:55,912
and I wanted to offer you my condolences,
to tell you how truly sorry I am.

219
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:57,623
Thank you, Gaius.

220
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,420
I see you've got your...

221
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,047
You know, if you need
any more, we have...

222
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,340
I'm fine.

223
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:08,216
And also, I'm not...

224
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:12,679
I'm not aware of your current situation,
but if you need a place to stay...

225
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:14,640
I've no desire
to join your harem.

226
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:15,891
No, look...

227
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,689
That's not what I...
That's not what...

228
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:29,029
We are trying to make a
difference within the fleet.

229
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,786
I dreamt of you
last night.

230
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,412
Did you?

231
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:40,207
That's interesting, 'cause
I often... I mean, I still...

232
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:43,585
It was an old dream. One in
which we both had parts to play.

233
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,797
Not in this little circus
you orchestrated.

234
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,801
But I guess
all dreams die hard.

235
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:55,931
I have the time. We could
share... If you wanted to.

236
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:59,643
You haven't changed,
Gaius. Not really.

237
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,144
You see.

238
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:05,941
The problem is,

239
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,275
I have.

240
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:28,130
Colonel. Colonel.

241
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,550
She wants to talk to you.
Me?

242
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:33,969
No, I'm waiting for the...

243
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,137
Colonel.

244
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,763
She is dying.

245
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:40,058
Could you just take a few
minutes out of your busy schedule

246
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:41,768
and be with her?

247
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,150
Colonel.

248
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,529
Is that what
I should call you?

249
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,616
Saul.

250
00:17:58,161 --> 00:17:59,327
Saul.

251
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,011
Thank you.

252
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,430
Thank me for what?

253
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:25,520
For the privilege of finally being
able to meet my father before I die.

254
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,151
You shouldn't
be thanking me.

255
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:35,363
I've spent most of my life
trying to kill your kind.

256
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,703
Too much confusion.

257
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,388
I want my mommy.

258
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,601
I want my mommy.

259
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:10,065
I want my mommy.
Take me home.

260
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:13,693
I want my mommy.
Take me home.

261
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:16,238
You know what? It's too bad they
never upgraded the FTL on this relic,

262
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:19,032
but if you think I'm gonna put up
with your sniveling and your whining

263
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:22,160
for another dozen jumps,
guess again.

264
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:24,996
I want my mommy.
Take me home.

265
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,206
Fine!

266
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:31,920
Let's see if you can
cry in your sleep.

267
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:38,385
Might be a long snooze, too, 'cause
these don't come in kiddie doses.

268
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,597
Give me your arm.
Give me your arm.

269
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,445
She showed you
the house, didn't she?

270
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,659
I have all our memories
from before the war.

271
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:48,163
To help fool Helo
into thinking I was her.

272
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:53,335
Ironic, isn't it, now that
she's returned the favor?

273
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:57,505
I'm not finished.

274
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:06,723
That house,
it meant a lot to her.

275
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:11,686
It must have cost her a lot
to betray him.

276
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,439
I know that
you had no idea.

277
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:19,486
And I know that when you found
out, you turned yourself in.

278
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,530
And I know

279
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:29,204
that I will
never forgive you.

280
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:54,646
Gaius, damn it!

281
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:06,366
Time was you couldn't go two steps in
here without tripping over a bottle.

282
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,994
Guess I have Caprica
to thank for that.

283
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:13,123
Hell, what are you talking about?
You're a worse lush than I am.

284
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:17,043
Not when I have important
responsibilities to attend to.

285
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:19,421
I got him to send out a recon mission.

286
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,131
Yeah, a recon mission.

287
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:22,924
Our people's future
is at stake,

288
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:24,926
and you got him to send
out a recon mission.

289
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:28,430
Our people. Our people.
That's right, Saul.

290
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:31,599
Thank Gods. Oh, frak.

291
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,227
Empty!

292
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:36,604
Saul?

293
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:40,400
You want to know who my people
are, lady? The ones on this ship.

294
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,527
The ones I fought
with and bled with.

295
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:45,363
The old man. This crew.
They're my family.

296
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:49,534
The only family I've known,
and the only one I care to.

297
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:52,287
Saul.

298
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:58,626
You're a pip,
you really are.

299
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:01,129
Old man.

300
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:05,091
Old compared to who?

301
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:11,181
You were my husband 2,000 years
before you even met Bill Adama.

302
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:13,600
Two thousand years.
That's a number.

303
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:15,685
That's what it means
to me. It's nothing.

304
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:19,731
But that man's friendship...
Frak!

305
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:23,401
You're a Cylon, Saul.

306
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:24,611
Yeah.

307
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:27,530
Whether you remember
that life or not,

308
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:32,368
at least you must understand
what we were trying to do.

309
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:38,750
We wanted to end the cycle of
war between man and machine.

310
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:39,876
That was a bust.

311
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,878
Yes, we failed.

312
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,173
But we have
a second chance now.

313
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:46,925
Hera.

314
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:53,098
Without her, our children are
going to die off one by one,

315
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:56,643
just like they're dying
right now in Cottle's sickbay.

316
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:58,228
I had a child.

317
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,188
He died.

318
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,610
You're wrong, Saul.

319
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:10,031
You had millions.

320
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:23,545
Ellen.

321
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:35,640
Come on, you've got
to be hungry. Eat this.

322
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:52,615
Do you know what I do
sometimes when I'm sad?

323
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:58,955
I go to this
special place.

324
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:04,544
A house where
I wanted to live

325
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:08,214
with the man
that I loved.

326
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:14,762
And set in the middle
of this beautiful forest.

327
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,140
And the sun.

328
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:23,771
The sun shines through
the windows all day long.

329
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,704
You can see this?

330
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,416
You can project?

331
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,880
Yeah, you can
still eat it.

332
00:25:57,348 --> 00:25:59,015
Missed a spot.

333
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,394
By your left sideburn.

334
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:06,231
The latch was busted.

335
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,321
Thank you.

336
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:15,406
So,

337
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:22,830
do you really believe all that bilge
you were spewing on the wireless?

338
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:25,959
Bilge?

339
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:27,085
Angels.

340
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:30,838
The angels walking among us.

341
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,677
The angels that bring out our
better nature, blah, blah, blah.

342
00:26:36,971 --> 00:26:38,263
Yeah, I do,
as a matter of fact.

343
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:41,516
Mmm-hmm. And you've seen
these angels for yourself?

344
00:26:42,685 --> 00:26:44,686
With alarming regularity.

345
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:47,313
Regularity.

346
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,942
That must be important
when you're full of crap.

347
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,819
That's charming.

348
00:26:53,696 --> 00:26:57,991
Absolutely charming. And you are
entitled to your opinion, obviously.

349
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:00,451
Who are you,
by the way, again?

350
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:01,577
Me?

351
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:05,123
I'm a dead chick,
that's who.

352
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:07,375
Oh, right,
and I'm full of crap.

353
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:13,256
No, I mean it. I'm dead.
As in six-feet-under dead.

354
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,342
Dead as in "crash landed,
burnt to a crisp" dead.

355
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:22,056
Here.

356
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:29,063
I took these off my body, what
was left of it, anyway, on Earth.

357
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:32,317
Take them.

358
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:35,570
You used to be a scientist,
run some tests.

359
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,780
Pull out the old Cylon detector,
do whatever you need to do,

360
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:39,699
because I have no idea.

361
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:42,952
The only thing I know
for sure, I'm not an angel.

362
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:21,532
We tried hooking him up
to the main power grid,

363
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:24,660
thought it might help
him reset his neural net.

364
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:29,207
So, in other words, you tried
to jumpstart him like a car.

365
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:33,419
Let me guess, it didn't
work so well for you.

366
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:36,756
Take a break.
Someone has to monitor him.

367
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,843
I'd like a minute alone with my
husband. I'm sure you don't mind.

368
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,381
It's funny,
you know, I...

369
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,598
I remember when

370
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:12,602
I told you that if I
found out you were a Cylon,

371
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:15,104
I would put a bullet
in your head.

372
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,650
Then some frakker beats me to
it and all I can think about is

373
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:21,652
how I can get you back.

374
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:25,531
Human, Cylon, it doesn't seem to matter.

375
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:28,284
I just wanted you back.

376
00:30:31,914 --> 00:30:33,915
Because you're just Sam.

377
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:41,339
You were my Sam.

378
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:54,602
And that's how
I'm gonna remember you.

379
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:58,814
The neural anatomy of fear and
faith share common afferent pathways.

380
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:09,033
Flip a coin. Increased vascular
pressure marks the threat response.

381
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:17,458
Freewill scuttles in the swamp
of fear. Do not fear the word.

382
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:19,210
You are the harbinger
of death, Kara Thrace.

383
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,921
You will lead them all
to their end. End of line.

384
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,090
New command.
Resume function.

385
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:26,801
Resume function.
Resume function.

386
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,689
A closed system lacks the
ability to renew itself.

387
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:41,649
Knowledge alone
is a poor primer.

388
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,401
This has been happening
all over the ship.

389
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:45,528
Power surges,
temperature fluctuations.

390
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:48,072
And now you're telling me
it's been him all along?

391
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,241
We had no idea
he had this ability.

392
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,826
How's he hooking
into the ship?

393
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,161
I thought all our systems
were firewalled.

394
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,914
Well, they are, which is why he
hasn't accessed your computers.

395
00:31:56,999 --> 00:31:59,584
But the organic resins we've been
injecting into your superstructure

396
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:02,587
contain inductive elements,
not unlike nerve fibers.

397
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:05,214
So he must've linked to
those, and then through them,

398
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:07,883
the electrical circuitry
embedded in Galactica's bulkheads.

399
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:11,220
What about our FTLs, now that
we've upgraded with your tech?

400
00:32:11,305 --> 00:32:13,097
Are they vulnerable?

401
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,976
Theoretically.
So theoretically,

402
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:20,938
he could jump this ship if he
wanted to, just like yours did.

403
00:32:21,023 --> 00:32:23,899
End of line. Begin reintegration
of right hemisphere...

404
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:27,153
Great. That's all we need.
Take him offline.

405
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,323
Do it!

406
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,536
There's a hole in the bucket,
dear Liza, dear Liza.

407
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:36,829
There's a hole
in the bucket.

408
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:39,624
A long view returns
patterns and repetitions.

409
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:42,209
All has happened before
and all will happen again.

410
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:49,008
That's a blessed relief.

411
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:53,971
"And so I walked, like
the beat cop I used to be.

412
00:32:54,056 --> 00:32:57,141
"When you walk, you see
things in different ways.

413
00:32:57,225 --> 00:33:00,686
"A street, faces, it all
becomes a map for you.

414
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:04,065
"A map
that's always changing.

415
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:08,778
"But when something's wrong,
something's out of place, you notice.

416
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,156
"A cop's eyes
always notice,

417
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,118
"and those eyes were one thing
they couldn't take away from me. "

418
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:20,456
What?

419
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:27,254
You look spiffy.

420
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,843
Going to the funeral.

421
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:36,931
For the crew that
we lost in the accident.

422
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:39,517
Open to page 61.

423
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,445
Don't worry.

424
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:56,075
Cottle won't mind.
It's medicinal.

425
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:00,246
I can't believe
you saved this.

426
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:10,214
Do you remember
that day?

427
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:14,301
Yes. New Caprica.

428
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:18,889
Baltar's groundbreaking.
We talked and talked.

429
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,643
About a lot of things.

430
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:28,149
Guess what I'm thinking
about right now.

431
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:32,027
Give me a hint.

432
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:33,320
Mountains.

433
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:37,032
A stream running
into a little lake.

434
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:41,078
Water so clear, it's like
looking through glass.

435
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:43,038
Your cabin.

436
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,208
The one you wanted to build.

437
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:49,837
The one
I never did build.

438
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:57,094
It's amazing how much
I still think about it.

439
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:06,771
You know,
sometimes I wonder

440
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:10,858
what home is.

441
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:16,030
Is it an actual place,

442
00:35:16,198 --> 00:35:20,367
or is it an absence
we carry inside of us?

443
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:25,164
Some kind of longing for
something, some kind of connection?

444
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:28,334
You know, I spent
my whole life on Caprica.

445
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:33,756
I was born in one house,
and then I moved to another.

446
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:39,637
Then I moved into a dorm room in college
and then there was a series of apartments.

447
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:41,680
Mostly alone.

448
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:48,562
I was always looking for
something a little bigger

449
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,232
or the perfect couch.

450
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,442
And then,

451
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,153
this.

452
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:00,783
And then, now

453
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:07,081
I don't think I've
ever felt truly at home

454
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:13,420
until these last few
months here with you.

455
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,637
I know
you love this ship.

456
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,100
You probably love her
more than you love me.

457
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:27,434
No.

458
00:36:29,563 --> 00:36:30,646
Yes.

459
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,275
And you'll miss her

460
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:37,736
the way you will miss me.

461
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:42,199
No.

462
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:46,620
I won't have to.

463
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:56,213
Bill, if you don't
get us off this ship,

464
00:36:56,298 --> 00:36:59,216
you may lose both of us
at the same time.

465
00:37:02,304 --> 00:37:04,430
Won't you
give us a chance?

466
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:20,613
All right, let's get back
to where our intrepid...

467
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:23,991
What is he?

468
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:26,368
A detective.

469
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:32,124
When I woke up I thought
I was back on Caprica.

470
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:36,837
And I swear to Gods, it took me
about a week to remember my name.

471
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,346
Harbinger.

472
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,350
Why would you...
That...

473
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:52,603
That's a stupid
frakkin' word.

474
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:56,148
I mean, what's that
mean anyway?

475
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:01,445
It's like an omen.

476
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:03,781
Portent.

477
00:38:08,662 --> 00:38:11,372
All right. So, I know, like, you know,

478
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:16,377
rain down death and destruction
and doom on everyone.

479
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:23,926
You know, that's supposed
to be my so-called destiny.

480
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:29,682
I pretty much figured the
whole Earth thing covered that.

481
00:38:34,688 --> 00:38:37,481
'Course, could also
mean you're, like...

482
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,275
A herald.

483
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:46,031
That's like
an angel, right?

484
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:49,284
Don't know. Maybe.

485
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:55,332
Okay, so I'm like death's
frat buddy, whatever.

486
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:57,376
You know, I don't care.

487
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:03,799
Except that
you hoped finding...

488
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,761
Felt like things
we're opening up, like...

489
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:12,016
Like I was meant to do something
else, you know, not just this

490
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:14,977
screwed up...

491
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,520
Enough.

492
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,564
Shut the frak up
already.

493
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,107
What?

494
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:30,284
I'm sorry. Sam's in some Cylon coma.

495
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:33,871
But listen to yourself.

496
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:40,294
You're sitting here guzzling
booze and bitching and moaning.

497
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:44,256
Only none of it matters.

498
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,676
'Cause you're here.
My daughter isn't.

499
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:52,806
She was the one pure thing to come
out of this whole miserable mess.

500
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:55,976
And now she's gone.

501
00:39:57,479 --> 00:39:59,938
And I can't do
a damn thing about it.

502
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:04,902
So, sorry if I don't feel like
sharing your pain right now, Captain.

503
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,633
Get off the piano, that's
a... Get off the piano!

504
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,259
All right.
Okay. All right.

505
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:31,095
Get off the piano.

506
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:37,267
I...

507
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,021
Broke a glass.

508
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:11,969
Cavil moved the colony.

509
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:13,053
When?

510
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:17,391
Judging from the residual energy
readings, about five months ago.

511
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,893
Just before the civil war.

512
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:23,230
And you have no idea
where he moved it to?

513
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:26,567
No.

514
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:31,905
Now, excuse me.

515
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:36,660
Anything you imagine in here can
be as real as you want it to be.

516
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:42,624
Do you want to see
a special room?

517
00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:47,171
A room where I thought
my daughter would live.

518
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:26,627
Sir?

519
00:42:27,337 --> 00:42:29,338
Can I walk with you, sir?

520
00:42:31,174 --> 00:42:33,175
I'm going to the funeral.

521
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,802
I understand
if you're not going.

522
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:38,805
I'd like your
permission, sir,

523
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,851
to take out a Raptor to go
and look for my daughter.

524
00:42:42,936 --> 00:42:45,437
I'm sure Athena would be
willing to pilot, and...

525
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:49,816
I've already sent out a recon
mission, and they reported back.

526
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,903
You did? We were looking for a facility

527
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:56,865
where we knew Boomer would probably
take Hera, but it was no longer there.

528
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,743
Sir,

529
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:04,248
let me take out that Raptor.
Maybe I can find something.

530
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:05,832
She's gone.

531
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:11,255
I've lost a son,
and you've lost a daughter.

532
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:16,510
But I can't condone
a suicide mission,

533
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:19,304
so let it go.

534
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,352
You want me
to let it go?

535
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,188
You're the one
who can't let go.

536
00:43:28,273 --> 00:43:29,731
Painting over the
holes in this bucket...

537
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:33,193
This ship is dead, but my
daughter might still be alive!

538
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:39,074
I understand your pain,
Captain, but don't lecture me.

539
00:43:41,703 --> 00:43:44,705
You're here to take
orders, do you understand?

540
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:47,874
I'm sorry.

541
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:51,420
I'm sorry.

542
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:57,217
One Raptor, Admiral.

543
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:00,178
Maybe it is
a suicide mission,

544
00:44:01,514 --> 00:44:05,642
but at least give me the
chance to do something. Please.

545
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:17,195
For those that
we have lost in the past,

546
00:44:18,323 --> 00:44:20,449
and for those that
we are burying today...

547
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:21,616
They gave
their lives...

548
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:22,909
We must remember...

549
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:23,994
...to save this ship...

550
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:25,871
...there is
a higher purpose...

551
00:44:25,955 --> 00:44:27,831
Casualties as much...
And so...

552
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,958
...as any soldier
fallen in battle...

553
00:44:30,043 --> 00:44:31,835
...we mourn the passing
of our friends...

554
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:32,919
Heavenly Father...

555
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:34,004
We must understand...

556
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,130
...grant us
the strength...

557
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:36,757
...that what
we sacrifice here today...

558
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:38,508
...the wisdom...
... are women and men...

559
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:40,552
...and above all
a measure of acceptance...

560
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:42,679
...of extreme courage...
... however small...

561
00:44:42,764 --> 00:44:44,723
...because that
is what we are.

562
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:50,270
Voyagers traversing
the stars in search of grace.

563
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:51,772
Grace.

564
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:53,315
Unity.
Unity.

565
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:55,692
Life, love.
Life, love.

566
00:44:55,777 --> 00:44:58,612
So say we all!
So say we all!

567
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:00,322
So say we all!

568
00:45:07,372 --> 00:45:09,456
Present arms.

569
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:25,555
Dismissed.

570
00:45:28,643 --> 00:45:31,353
Listen to me,
for death is not the end.

571
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:36,900
And I'm not talking
about Cylon resurrection.

572
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:41,822
I'm talking about
the gift of eternal life

573
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:45,534
that is offered to
each and every one of us.

574
00:45:47,036 --> 00:45:51,164
Yes, even the most
flawed amongst us.

575
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:56,169
All we need is
the courage

576
00:45:58,089 --> 00:46:02,592
to face death when it comes
calling for us, embrace it, even.

577
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:09,015
Only then will we truly have
the ability to cross over.

578
00:46:10,435 --> 00:46:14,604
As one amongst us here
has already crossed over.

579
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:18,525
One amongst us here

580
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:24,656
is living proof that
there is life after death.

581
00:46:26,993 --> 00:46:30,495
The blood on these dog tags

582
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:36,001
comes from necrotic flesh.
That means a dead body.

583
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:41,381
The DNA analysis is a
100% proof-positive match

584
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:44,843
for one Captain Kara Thrace.

585
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:49,723
I told you there were
angels walking amongst you.

586
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,975
When will you believe me?

587
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:55,270
She took these from
her own mortal remains

588
00:46:56,397 --> 00:46:59,399
that lie on Earth even now,
interred with her bones...

589
00:46:59,484 --> 00:47:01,151
That's enough, Baltar!

590
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:02,444
Ask her yourself.

591
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:03,945
I will put you in the brig
now! She will not deny it.

592
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:05,322
She's not a Cylon.

593
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:07,199
They've already
been revealed to us.

594
00:47:07,283 --> 00:47:09,910
Ask her yourself.
She will not deny it!

595
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:20,086
Dismissed, everyone!
Off the deck now!

596
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:22,931
Kara.
What are you doing?

597
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,232
Okay, listen to me.

598
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:36,945
I don't care, right.
I don't.

599
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:40,448
We've all been through
some crazy, crazy stuff.

600
00:52:41,075 --> 00:52:43,743
I don't care
what he's talking about.

601
00:52:44,245 --> 00:52:46,329
And he can talk until
he's blue in the face

602
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:49,290
about God, Gods,
miracles, life, death,

603
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:51,751
whatever he...
I don't care.

604
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:55,255
I don't care what
you think you saw.

605
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:59,092
I watched your Viper
explode. Don't care.

606
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:01,845
I'm here. You're here.

607
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,100
'Cause I'm Lee
and you're Kara.

608
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:11,354
The rest of it
isn't worth a damn.

609
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:12,647
Right?

610
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:13,940
You're right.

611
00:53:17,111 --> 00:53:21,447
I cannot help
what people say

612
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:25,660
and I can't control
who believes it.

613
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:30,957
It's okay.

614
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:41,384
This is all that matters.

615
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:49,309
Okay.

616
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:52,312
I'll see you around.

617
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:53,688
Hmm.

618
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:55,189
Kara Thrace.

619
00:54:38,943 --> 00:54:40,777
You wanted to see me?

620
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:42,862
Yeah.

621
00:54:43,864 --> 00:54:45,698
I made some decisions.

622
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:46,866
Good.

623
00:54:46,951 --> 00:54:49,786
About time you sent those
toaster work crews packing,

624
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:51,537
for all the good
they've done.

625
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:52,747
Actually,

626
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,376
I'm stopping all the
repairs on the ship.

627
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:10,640
Put out the orders that I want the
crew to start stripping down Galactica.

628
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:13,184
Pack in all the weapons
and gear.

629
00:55:20,943 --> 00:55:24,237
Let's start off-loading
civilians by tomorrow.

630
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:28,658
Full crews and ordinances
transferred by the end of the week.

631
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:30,243
What?

632
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:35,456
We're abandoning ship, Tigh.

633
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:39,669
No! No, you can't do this.

634
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:44,173
I have to, Saul.

635
00:55:45,009 --> 00:55:47,885
She's dying,
and we both know it.

636
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:50,596
So she's hurting,
so what?

637
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,475
Just like that you're going to
turn you frakking back on her

638
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:58,521
and leave her out here to rust
like some mothballed relic?

639
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:00,273
It's all right.
No!

640
00:56:00,733 --> 00:56:04,068
As your XO, I can't let
you do this. I won't.

641
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:08,281
It's all right, Saul. You
don't have to do this for me.

642
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:09,866
Look, all right.

643
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:12,910
If you want me to give the
frakkin' order, I will. But...

644
00:56:12,995 --> 00:56:15,997
You don't have to act out
the part anymore.

645
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:21,044
Well, now I don't know what
the frak you're talking about.

646
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,592
You've never
let me down, Saul.

647
00:56:28,135 --> 00:56:31,721
I can't blame you
for being what you are,

648
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:36,559
especially since
it includes being

649
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:39,645
the finest officer and
friend I've ever had.

650
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:45,151
This ship never let us down, so
we're going to send her off in style.

651
00:56:58,624 --> 00:57:00,500
The old man...

652
00:57:02,336 --> 00:57:05,922
Ellen was right, if anyone's
old around here, it's me.

653
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:09,675
Two thousand years
and counting.

654
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:14,138
And I've still got
my own teeth.

655
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:25,858
So we're gonna
do this, huh?

656
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:27,944
Mmm-hmm.

657
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:31,239
She was
a grand old lady.

658
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:33,616
The grandest.

659
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:37,662
To Galactica,
best ship in the fleet.

660
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:42,333
To Galactica.

661
00:58:49,193 --> 00:58:50,902
Everything went
smoothly, I take it?

662
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:52,111
Yes.

663
00:58:52,196 --> 00:58:55,114
It's a shame I can't be there to
see the expression on Ellen's face

664
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:57,783
when she realizes
how we played her.

665
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:01,329
You had a hard day's work. Go get
some rest. We'll take it from here.

666
00:59:03,624 --> 00:59:06,459
Don't worry. We'll
take good care of her.

667
00:59:24,645 --> 00:59:26,938
No. Boomer.

668
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:32,276
There, there now. You'll have all
sorts of new playmates pretty soon.

669
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:35,696
Boomer.

670
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:38,491
Boomer!

671
01:00:28,709 --> 01:00:31,502
Make sure she gets
through okay, please.

672
01:01:11,543 --> 01:01:13,627
I know
you can hear me, Sam,

673
01:01:14,421 --> 01:01:17,757
just like I know on some
level you'll understand.

674
01:01:19,051 --> 01:01:21,177
The old me
is dead and gone,

675
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:23,596
same as the old you,

676
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:26,974
just took me
a while to accept it.

677
01:01:28,393 --> 01:01:31,103
Which brings us
to the larger question,

678
01:01:32,356 --> 01:01:33,939
why am I here?

679
01:01:35,484 --> 01:01:37,401
We could spend
a lot of time speculating,

680
01:01:37,486 --> 01:01:39,862
but since it's likely to be
a one-sided conversation,

681
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:42,239
I'll just tell you
my theory.

682
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:45,701
I think it has something
to do with this music.

683
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:51,082
This song that my father tried
to teach me when I was a kid,

684
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:55,294
the song that woke up the
Five, that led us to Earth.

685
01:01:55,962 --> 01:02:00,966
There's a pattern there,
a pattern that I can't see.

686
01:02:02,803 --> 01:02:04,845
But I think
that you can.

687
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:08,808
So we are going to
sit in this room

688
01:02:08,892 --> 01:02:12,812
and we are going to
pick it apart beat by beat,

689
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:16,690
until we figure it out.
