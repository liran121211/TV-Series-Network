1
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,438
On me, let's move!

2
00:01:08,901 --> 00:01:09,984
Wait.

3
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,662
Tell the old man
I owed him one.

4
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,792
Doesn't change anything
you did, though.

5
00:01:26,043 --> 00:01:27,085
No.

6
00:01:28,629 --> 00:01:30,505
We all make
our choices.

7
00:01:31,924 --> 00:01:33,800
Today I made a choice.

8
00:01:35,344 --> 00:01:37,345
I think it's
my last one.

9
00:01:38,347 --> 00:01:40,515
All right, this is really touching.
Can we get the hell out of here?

10
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:43,101
You should know that your
Raptor's been destroyed.

11
00:01:43,185 --> 00:01:44,936
You can't go
back that way.

12
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,270
Yeah, well, that's not the plan.

13
00:01:46,355 --> 00:01:48,189
Can you not
tell her the plan?

14
00:01:48,273 --> 00:01:49,440
Right.

15
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,327
Missed the trap
seven times in two days.

16
00:02:02,037 --> 00:02:04,580
There's
a new Galactica record.

17
00:02:04,665 --> 00:02:07,208
Regs say that you've
washed out, Rook.

18
00:02:09,086 --> 00:02:10,753
Time to look
for a new career.

19
00:02:10,838 --> 00:02:13,047
What do you want
me to do, sir?

20
00:02:13,382 --> 00:02:16,134
Do you want me to beg for my
billet? Do you want me to crawl?

21
00:02:16,218 --> 00:02:19,720
I want you to land your frakking bird
without digging holes into my deck.

22
00:02:19,805 --> 00:02:20,972
How's that, huh?

23
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:24,851
How about being a pilot, an
officer worthy of the uniform?

24
00:02:25,727 --> 00:02:29,939
Take your job seriously. Don't let
your personal life get in the way.

25
00:02:32,192 --> 00:02:35,111
I've read your jacket,
your whole story.

26
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:40,074
I know that your family's gone,
and I know that you have no home.

27
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,953
All you got is the service,
and it's slowly slipping away.

28
00:02:45,747 --> 00:02:49,375
All because you're all
wrapped up in survivor's guilt,

29
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,628
and you're trying to find
a way to wash yourself out.

30
00:02:53,672 --> 00:02:57,341
The doctor's in. Check
your neuroses at the door.

31
00:02:59,428 --> 00:03:04,098
A lot of people have died on this ship.
There's a lot of ghosts running around here.

32
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:07,101
You don't want to pull them
into your cockpit with you,

33
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:10,813
because you won't come back
alive. Do you understand that?

34
00:03:11,106 --> 00:03:12,356
Yes, sir.

35
00:03:13,108 --> 00:03:17,487
I don't think you do, but
maybe someday you will.

36
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,031
For now,

37
00:03:21,658 --> 00:03:23,868
make the trap
tomorrow, Rook.

38
00:03:25,537 --> 00:03:26,871
Dismissed.

39
00:03:29,124 --> 00:03:31,834
Thank you, sir.
I owe you one.

40
00:03:33,378 --> 00:03:35,171
You and a lot of other
people owe me one,

41
00:03:35,255 --> 00:03:38,716
but you know what, very
few people ever pay back,

42
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,927
especially the ones that
owe you their lives.

43
00:03:43,472 --> 00:03:47,350
I'll pay you back one day, sir,
when it really means something.

44
00:03:49,186 --> 00:03:50,603
You do that.

45
00:03:53,941 --> 00:03:57,443
Okay, get this guy cross-checked
and set me up a large-bore IV.

46
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:59,403
I need a set of vitals
on this Marine over here.

47
00:03:59,488 --> 00:04:02,782
I want a CT scan here on this one,
and get him the frak out of here.

48
00:04:02,866 --> 00:04:06,327
Here we go. It's all right.
You're gonna be all right.

49
00:04:09,831 --> 00:04:11,165
He's a goner.

50
00:04:14,002 --> 00:04:17,505
All right, you'll be... You're
gonna be all right. Okay.

51
00:04:31,478 --> 00:04:32,603
What took you
so long?

52
00:04:32,688 --> 00:04:34,355
Stopped for coffee.

53
00:04:34,815 --> 00:04:37,066
How many other Raptor teams made it?

54
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,818
Haven't seen
anybody else.

55
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,571
Okay, back
the way we came.

56
00:04:41,655 --> 00:04:43,531
Guns, point.
Yes, sir.

57
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:45,992
We're retracing
our steps.

58
00:05:05,554 --> 00:05:06,971
Say again,
Apollo!

59
00:05:07,055 --> 00:05:09,307
I cannot copy your
last transmission.

60
00:05:09,391 --> 00:05:10,808
This is the XO.

61
00:05:10,892 --> 00:05:15,479
Red stripes to repel boarders,
Deck 21, portside, frame 10.

62
00:05:15,564 --> 00:05:17,481
We got the prize.
Repeat, we have the prize.

63
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:19,650
Formed up with Assault Two
and are heading back to base.

64
00:05:19,735 --> 00:05:23,195
Roger that. ETA five
minutes. Actual out.

65
00:05:24,448 --> 00:05:26,866
Fire! We got
a fire up here!

66
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:32,455
Connect me to Command Unit. Yes, sir!

67
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:38,085
Move reserve forces
to guard airlock.

68
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:41,589
Assault force is en route.
ETA five minutes.

69
00:05:41,673 --> 00:05:44,300
I repeat. ETA five minutes.

70
00:06:03,028 --> 00:06:04,487
We're friendly!

71
00:06:06,698 --> 00:06:08,741
Hold your fire!
Friendlies!

72
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,829
Rangel, Peters, form up!

73
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:17,708
Sorry about that.

74
00:06:17,793 --> 00:06:19,418
Doc, you did good.
Thank you.

75
00:06:19,503 --> 00:06:20,920
We'll take Hera.
Right. Come on.

76
00:06:21,004 --> 00:06:21,921
Right. Come on.

77
00:06:22,005 --> 00:06:23,339
Come on.
Bring Hera.

78
00:06:24,341 --> 00:06:27,176
Get them out of here.
Get them out of here.

79
00:06:30,597 --> 00:06:32,390
Fall back. Fall back!

80
00:07:02,462 --> 00:07:05,214
Oh, my Gods. Hera.

81
00:07:18,812 --> 00:07:19,979
Clear.

82
00:07:44,296 --> 00:07:45,504
Gods.
Check his status.

83
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:48,340
Keep that belt tight on
and get back here!

84
00:07:50,552 --> 00:07:51,760
Hang on.

85
00:07:58,435 --> 00:07:59,560
Hera!

86
00:07:59,644 --> 00:08:02,688
Hera! Come back
here. Hera!

87
00:08:02,772 --> 00:08:04,148
Look at me.

88
00:08:06,359 --> 00:08:07,526
Go.
No, you'll bleed out.

89
00:08:07,611 --> 00:08:08,611
Go!

90
00:08:09,654 --> 00:08:10,696
Go!

91
00:10:10,734 --> 00:10:11,817
Okay.

92
00:10:33,798 --> 00:10:35,549
I'm empty.

93
00:10:35,675 --> 00:10:37,051
Two rounds.

94
00:11:27,018 --> 00:11:28,143
Hera!

95
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:43,283
Hera!

96
00:12:08,893 --> 00:12:10,769
I've been here before.

97
00:12:11,938 --> 00:12:13,021
Yes.

98
00:12:30,081 --> 00:12:31,331
We're supposed to...

99
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:32,875
Go into the
opera house.

100
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:39,358
This one's
still alive.

101
00:13:39,442 --> 00:13:41,109
Get him the hell
out of here!

102
00:13:42,362 --> 00:13:44,071
They got the girl.

103
00:13:44,155 --> 00:13:46,281
They've got
the little girl!

104
00:13:55,542 --> 00:13:57,125
This makes it
a lot easier.

105
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:59,670
I just take the little
girl and I'm out of here.

106
00:13:59,754 --> 00:14:01,213
Not a chance.

107
00:14:05,301 --> 00:14:07,469
Cavil, we won't let you
take Hera. You know that.

108
00:14:07,554 --> 00:14:09,179
I know nothing
of the kind.

109
00:14:09,264 --> 00:14:11,890
I know I'm going to watch you
chase your tails across the universe

110
00:14:11,975 --> 00:14:13,016
for another four years.

111
00:14:13,101 --> 00:14:14,643
That's not
gonna happen.

112
00:14:17,313 --> 00:14:19,481
This thing is the key
to my people's survival,

113
00:14:19,566 --> 00:14:21,024
and I'm not leaving
without it.

114
00:14:21,109 --> 00:14:24,194
Hera's not a thing.
She's a child,

115
00:14:25,321 --> 00:14:27,739
and she holds the key to
humanity's survival, as well.

116
00:14:27,824 --> 00:14:29,825
And how do
you know that?

117
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:39,918
I see angels,

118
00:14:41,671 --> 00:14:43,672
angels in this
very room.

119
00:14:44,173 --> 00:14:47,926
Now, I may be mad, but that
doesn't mean that I'm not right.

120
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:52,848
Because there's another
force at work here.

121
00:14:52,932 --> 00:14:54,600
There always
has been.

122
00:14:54,684 --> 00:14:56,268
It's undeniable.
We've all experienced it.

123
00:14:56,352 --> 00:14:59,771
Everyone in this room has witnessed
events that they can't fathom,

124
00:14:59,856 --> 00:15:02,691
let alone explain
away by rational means.

125
00:15:03,484 --> 00:15:06,069
Puzzles deciphered
in prophecy.

126
00:15:07,488 --> 00:15:09,698
Dreams given to
a chosen few.

127
00:15:10,825 --> 00:15:13,201
Our loved ones,
dead,

128
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:15,746
risen.

129
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:22,628
Whether we want to call that God
or Gods or some sublime inspiration

130
00:15:22,712 --> 00:15:24,922
or a divine force that we
can't know or understand,

131
00:15:25,006 --> 00:15:27,466
it doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

132
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:30,344
It's here. It exists,

133
00:15:31,804 --> 00:15:34,890
and our two destinies
are entwined in its force.

134
00:15:39,854 --> 00:15:42,648
If that were true,
and that's a big "if,"

135
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:47,110
how do I know this force has
our best interests in mind?

136
00:15:47,862 --> 00:15:51,031
How do you know that God
is on your side, Doctor?

137
00:15:52,408 --> 00:15:53,617
I don't.

138
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,913
God's not on
any one side.

139
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:03,752
God's a force of nature,
beyond good and evil.

140
00:16:05,421 --> 00:16:07,756
Good and evil,
we created those.

141
00:16:09,092 --> 00:16:10,968
You wanna break
the cycle?

142
00:16:11,886 --> 00:16:15,430
Break the cycle of
birth? Death? Rebirth?

143
00:16:15,515 --> 00:16:18,433
Destruction?
Escape? Death?

144
00:16:20,103 --> 00:16:22,104
Well, that's
in our hands,

145
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,147
in our hands only.

146
00:16:26,567 --> 00:16:28,694
It requires
a leap of faith.

147
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,738
It requires that
we live in hope,

148
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:33,949
not fear.

149
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,578
If I leave you this girl, that
means the destruction of my people.

150
00:16:39,122 --> 00:16:41,957
How does our extinction
fit into this picture

151
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,959
that you want
us to believe in?

152
00:16:44,043 --> 00:16:46,169
We'll give you
resurrection.

153
00:16:47,255 --> 00:16:48,338
Saul!

154
00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:55,053
You give us Hera and we
will give you resurrection.

155
00:16:56,139 --> 00:16:57,973
But the war
ends here.

156
00:16:59,308 --> 00:17:01,435
You leave humanity
in peace

157
00:17:01,811 --> 00:17:04,730
and give up the pursuit
now and for all time.

158
00:17:08,317 --> 00:17:09,484
Agreed.

159
00:17:09,986 --> 00:17:12,279
How do we know we can
take your word for it?

160
00:17:12,363 --> 00:17:13,822
You don't.

161
00:17:13,906 --> 00:17:15,741
You have to make
a leap of faith.

162
00:17:15,825 --> 00:17:18,952
It's your call, Bill.
I'll back you either way.

163
00:17:19,954 --> 00:17:22,205
I'm losing a lot
of men out there.

164
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,291
I can do something
about that right now.

165
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:25,625
Give me that phone.

166
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,377
Patch him through.

167
00:17:30,339 --> 00:17:33,258
Hello? Hello,
it's me, Cavil.

168
00:17:34,677 --> 00:17:36,094
Stand down,
all forces!

169
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:37,679
Cease fire immediately!

170
00:17:45,271 --> 00:17:46,938
Galactica, Hotdog.

171
00:17:47,482 --> 00:17:48,815
They're pulling back.

172
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,109
Repeat, they're
pulling back!

173
00:17:53,613 --> 00:17:54,988
Everyone,

174
00:17:55,531 --> 00:17:56,948
stand down.

175
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,250
I'm as good as my word.

176
00:18:42,161 --> 00:18:45,622
Admiral, Viper wings aboard.
We lost four birds.

177
00:18:46,707 --> 00:18:50,168
Assault forces aboard,
and we've lost seven Raptors.

178
00:19:09,689 --> 00:19:11,064
What are
they doing?

179
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:15,068
Each of them knows part of
the secret to resurrection,

180
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:19,239
and they're gonna interact
with the data flow in the water

181
00:19:19,407 --> 00:19:21,074
and... I don't know.

182
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:24,911
It's a lot of complicated technical
talk about sharing the information

183
00:19:24,996 --> 00:19:26,580
among the five of them
and then transferring

184
00:19:26,664 --> 00:19:29,166
it over to the
colonies somehow.

185
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,584
Now, for a moment,

186
00:19:30,668 --> 00:19:33,086
we're going to know everything
there is to know about one another.

187
00:19:33,171 --> 00:19:35,505
I'm looking
forward to that.

188
00:19:35,965 --> 00:19:38,300
There are certain
things that...

189
00:19:39,177 --> 00:19:41,887
That we've all done,
certain things that

190
00:19:42,388 --> 00:19:44,973
people would be
shocked to learn about.

191
00:19:45,057 --> 00:19:46,224
Hey, I don't
mean to rush you,

192
00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:49,728
but you are keeping
two civilizations waiting!

193
00:19:51,939 --> 00:19:55,192
Let's just all
agree that no matter

194
00:19:55,276 --> 00:19:57,569
what we learn
about each other,

195
00:19:58,196 --> 00:20:01,156
we're all Cylons, and we're
all capable of making mistakes.

196
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,993
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're forgiven
for all your dark secrets.

197
00:20:05,411 --> 00:20:06,912
Let's do this.

198
00:20:30,061 --> 00:20:31,436
Any word?

199
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,687
We're getting
the data now.

200
00:20:32,897 --> 00:20:34,189
It looks right.

201
00:20:34,273 --> 00:20:37,442
They're downloading the
resurrection designs now.

202
00:21:29,287 --> 00:21:30,370
They've broken
off the download!

203
00:21:30,454 --> 00:21:32,247
It's a trick!
Open fire!

204
00:21:45,845 --> 00:21:46,970
Frak!

205
00:22:36,062 --> 00:22:37,270
We've gotta
get out of here!

206
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:39,439
Starbuck!
Jump the ship!

207
00:22:43,903 --> 00:22:45,820
I don't have the
rendezvous coordinates!

208
00:22:45,905 --> 00:22:47,280
It doesn't matter!

209
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:49,449
Just jump us out
of here now! Jump!

210
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,373
Just trust yourself.

211
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:02,087
There must be some
kind of way out of here.

212
00:23:19,188 --> 00:23:22,399
I thought that if I assigned
numbers to the notes...

213
00:23:32,368 --> 00:23:34,577
If that's me lying there,
then what am I?

214
00:23:38,332 --> 00:23:39,999
I look at you now and
I don't see Kara Thrace.

215
00:23:40,084 --> 00:23:44,254
I see an angel blazing with
the light of God. Angel.

216
00:24:03,399 --> 00:24:04,482
Jump!

217
00:24:11,115 --> 00:24:13,283
You're tempting fate.

218
00:24:13,367 --> 00:24:14,492
Mmm.

219
00:24:14,577 --> 00:24:17,787
If I have a fate then it is
set, and thinking about it

220
00:24:17,872 --> 00:24:18,997
isn't gonna make it
happen any faster.

221
00:24:19,081 --> 00:24:20,123
Okay. Fair enough.

222
00:24:20,207 --> 00:24:22,375
But flying?

223
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,960
When you're
thinking about dying...

224
00:24:24,044 --> 00:24:26,671
It's a bad
way of doing business.

225
00:24:27,006 --> 00:24:28,131
You're gonna
get scared,

226
00:24:28,215 --> 00:24:30,383
and you're gonna start
second-guessing yourself.

227
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:31,968
I'm not scared.

228
00:24:33,721 --> 00:24:36,055
You said that you
think about dying

229
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,266
every time that you
get into a cockpit.

230
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,601
Uh-huh.

231
00:24:40,186 --> 00:24:41,311
Well, hello!

232
00:24:42,605 --> 00:24:44,355
Yeah, but it doesn't
scare me, Lee.

233
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,441
That's what
you don't get.

234
00:24:49,069 --> 00:24:53,615
What, so it's Kara Thrace,
the fearless warrior?

235
00:24:54,825 --> 00:24:55,992
Right?

236
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,123
No, I know...
I know fear,

237
00:25:03,584 --> 00:25:05,585
and I get
scared, just...

238
00:25:06,253 --> 00:25:07,921
Just not of dying.

239
00:25:11,467 --> 00:25:13,676
So then, what
does scare you?

240
00:25:14,887 --> 00:25:16,346
Mmm...

241
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:22,685
Sorry.

242
00:25:24,688 --> 00:25:26,314
Being forgotten.

243
00:26:25,708 --> 00:26:27,750
You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.

244
00:26:32,089 --> 00:26:33,756
XO.
Sir.

245
00:26:33,841 --> 00:26:35,925
Sitrep.
Damage report.

246
00:26:36,427 --> 00:26:38,428
I'm okay,
I'm okay, go.

247
00:26:38,512 --> 00:26:39,721
Sir.

248
00:27:15,549 --> 00:27:17,216
Wake the frak up!

249
00:27:19,595 --> 00:27:20,678
What?

250
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,390
You're getting sloppy.
Careless.

251
00:27:25,351 --> 00:27:26,559
Stupid.

252
00:27:28,979 --> 00:27:30,271
I don't know what
you're talking about.

253
00:27:30,356 --> 00:27:31,689
I'm not an idiot.

254
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,649
Neither is the XO.

255
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,864
Just be careful, okay?

256
00:27:41,033 --> 00:27:42,867
Okay. All right.

257
00:27:44,244 --> 00:27:45,495
Thanks.

258
00:27:48,832 --> 00:27:50,875
I appreciate the heads-up.

259
00:27:53,837 --> 00:27:55,380
You're welcome.

260
00:28:00,094 --> 00:28:04,055
You know, there's people you can
count on and people you can't.

261
00:28:04,515 --> 00:28:07,725
It's good to know the
difference between the two.

262
00:28:20,989 --> 00:28:22,657
We're mostly here.

263
00:28:23,575 --> 00:28:26,077
The engines,
life support.

264
00:28:29,123 --> 00:28:33,543
There's red lines through her
lateral structural members.

265
00:28:38,215 --> 00:28:41,384
She's broke her back.
She'll never jump again.

266
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,556
Wherever we are is
where we're gonna stay.

267
00:28:53,021 --> 00:28:55,273
Where have you
taken us, Kara?

268
00:30:00,214 --> 00:30:02,548
Glad you could
join us, Admiral.

269
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,593
Lieutenant Hoshi suits
me just fine, sir.

270
00:30:05,761 --> 00:30:08,846
Admiral stars turned out
to be a little heavy.

271
00:30:09,223 --> 00:30:10,389
Happiest day of
my life when I saw

272
00:30:10,474 --> 00:30:12,600
that Raptor jump in at
the rendezvous point.

273
00:30:12,684 --> 00:30:15,102
Well, there you
have it, Admiral.

274
00:30:15,521 --> 00:30:17,271
The most
advanced civilization

275
00:30:17,356 --> 00:30:19,232
we could locate
on this planet.

276
00:30:24,905 --> 00:30:26,822
I can't see them
talking to each other, sir.

277
00:30:26,907 --> 00:30:30,284
Either they communicate a different
way, or they're pre-verbal.

278
00:30:30,369 --> 00:30:31,994
Judging by the look
of their tools,

279
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:34,580
which are rudimentary,
to say the least,

280
00:30:34,665 --> 00:30:38,543
I'd suggest that we found an
early, ritualistic tribal society.

281
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:40,711
They bury their dead.

282
00:30:41,046 --> 00:30:44,966
I came across a grave a couple
of clicks back and ran some tests.

283
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:47,426
Their DNA is
compatible with ours.

284
00:30:47,511 --> 00:30:49,845
Meaning we can
breed with them?

285
00:30:50,514 --> 00:30:52,723
You got a one-track
mind, Doc.

286
00:30:52,808 --> 00:30:56,894
What? Listen, I'm talking about the
survival of the human race, actually,

287
00:30:56,979 --> 00:30:59,438
not some get-together
with the natives.

288
00:30:59,523 --> 00:31:01,816
You also have no
sense of humor.

289
00:31:05,195 --> 00:31:06,362
Right.

290
00:31:06,989 --> 00:31:08,614
Right, I'm sorry.

291
00:31:09,616 --> 00:31:11,409
How is
that possible?

292
00:31:11,785 --> 00:31:16,122
Human beings naturally
evolved on a planet

293
00:31:16,206 --> 00:31:18,374
one million
light years away.

294
00:31:18,458 --> 00:31:19,458
The odds against
that are...

295
00:31:19,543 --> 00:31:21,085
Astronomical, yeah.

296
00:31:23,755 --> 00:31:27,049
One might even say there
was a divine hand at work.

297
00:31:27,384 --> 00:31:31,262
Well, whoever's
responsible, we're here,

298
00:31:32,681 --> 00:31:35,099
and here's where
we're gonna stay,

299
00:31:36,518 --> 00:31:38,352
with our
new families.

300
00:31:53,452 --> 00:31:56,662
My vote is that we clear
everything back to this ridge.

301
00:31:56,747 --> 00:31:59,498
There's easy access to the
water down by the river.

302
00:31:59,583 --> 00:32:01,834
In fact, the whole area
is ripe for cultivation.

303
00:32:01,918 --> 00:32:04,170
We should be able to lay out
the preliminary lines for a city

304
00:32:04,254 --> 00:32:05,963
within a day or two.

305
00:32:06,048 --> 00:32:07,089
No.

306
00:32:09,426 --> 00:32:10,676
No city.

307
00:32:11,803 --> 00:32:13,304
Not this time.

308
00:32:17,434 --> 00:32:19,435
What do you
propose we do?

309
00:32:24,691 --> 00:32:25,816
We break the cycle.

310
00:32:27,611 --> 00:32:30,279
We leave it all
behind and start over.

311
00:32:31,365 --> 00:32:33,032
You're talking
about a little over

312
00:32:33,116 --> 00:32:36,494
38,000 people,
the entire human race,

313
00:32:37,496 --> 00:32:41,457
with nothing but the clothes on
their backs and some provisions.

314
00:32:41,833 --> 00:32:44,126
It's not the
entire human race.

315
00:32:44,836 --> 00:32:46,379
There are people
already here.

316
00:32:46,463 --> 00:32:47,797
Tribal.

317
00:32:48,131 --> 00:32:50,049
Without language, even.

318
00:32:50,717 --> 00:32:52,843
Well, we can
give them that.

319
00:32:53,595 --> 00:32:55,888
I mean, we can
give them the...

320
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:58,974
The best part
of ourselves.

321
00:32:59,643 --> 00:33:01,310
And not the baggage,
not the ships,

322
00:33:01,395 --> 00:33:04,105
the equipment, the
technology, the weapons.

323
00:33:04,189 --> 00:33:07,983
If there's one thing that we
should have learned it's that...

324
00:33:08,276 --> 00:33:12,071
You know, our brains have
always outraced our hearts.

325
00:33:12,155 --> 00:33:16,659
Our science charges ahead,
our souls lag behind.

326
00:33:19,871 --> 00:33:21,497
Let's start anew.

327
00:33:34,678 --> 00:33:37,304
We'll land
civilians at various points

328
00:33:38,181 --> 00:33:39,849
around the planet.

329
00:33:40,434 --> 00:33:42,184
Our objective
will be to spread

330
00:33:42,269 --> 00:33:44,270
the people out as
much as possible

331
00:33:44,354 --> 00:33:47,398
to give them the best
possibility of survival.

332
00:33:48,024 --> 00:33:50,901
Supplies will be evenly
distributed throughout the camps,

333
00:33:50,986 --> 00:33:54,280
and locations will be
documented and given to everyone.

334
00:33:54,364 --> 00:33:58,951
I have to say, I'm shocked at how
amenable everyone is to this notion.

335
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:02,580
I would have thought there'd be
a general uprising at the idea

336
00:34:02,664 --> 00:34:04,874
of losing whatever little
creature comforts we had left.

337
00:34:04,958 --> 00:34:08,794
Don't underestimate the desire
for a clean slate, Mr. Lampkin.

338
00:34:10,172 --> 00:34:11,839
Have you made
a decision?

339
00:34:11,923 --> 00:34:16,427
The Sixes, the Eights, and
the Twos have decided to stay.

340
00:34:17,387 --> 00:34:19,096
See how we can contribute to a world

341
00:34:19,181 --> 00:34:21,223
before we pass
into God's hands.

342
00:34:21,933 --> 00:34:23,851
We'll give the Baseship
to the Centurions,

343
00:34:23,935 --> 00:34:26,187
let them find
their own destiny.

344
00:34:26,813 --> 00:34:29,106
I think they've
earned their freedom.

345
00:34:29,191 --> 00:34:31,358
And what if they evolve
again on their own

346
00:34:31,443 --> 00:34:34,987
and decide to come back in a few
hundred years and wipe us out?

347
00:34:35,071 --> 00:34:36,155
It's a risk,

348
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,157
but I think setting
them free may be enough

349
00:34:38,241 --> 00:34:40,034
to break the cycle
of violence.

350
00:34:40,118 --> 00:34:42,369
Then it's
a risk worth taking.

351
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,664
And I agree.
They've earned it.

352
00:34:47,417 --> 00:34:50,377
Now, once the civilians
have been offloaded,

353
00:34:50,462 --> 00:34:51,837
the Fleet will
leave the orbit

354
00:34:51,922 --> 00:34:53,631
and rendezvous
with Galactica.

355
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,800
The course of the
Fleet will be plotted

356
00:34:55,884 --> 00:34:57,802
into the nav computer
ahead of time,

357
00:34:58,136 --> 00:35:01,430
but the actual piloting
will be done by Mr. Anders.

358
00:35:02,015 --> 00:35:05,267
He'll guide the entire
Fleet directly into the sun.

359
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,156
I love you.

360
00:36:50,165 --> 00:36:51,373
Goodbye,

361
00:36:52,375 --> 00:36:53,417
Sam.

362
00:37:10,644 --> 00:37:12,937
I'll see you on
the other side.

363
00:38:06,991 --> 00:38:08,784
Is your name
William Adama?

364
00:38:08,868 --> 00:38:09,993
Yes.

365
00:38:11,246 --> 00:38:13,205
Are you an officer
in the Colonial Fleet?

366
00:38:13,289 --> 00:38:14,790
Yes.

367
00:38:15,291 --> 00:38:16,917
Are you a Cylon?

368
00:38:19,754 --> 00:38:22,923
I'm sorry, Bill. We're still
establishing tests for the control.

369
00:38:23,049 --> 00:38:25,384
I need verifiable
yeses and nos.

370
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:30,431
No, I'm not
a Cylon.

371
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:35,102
Have you ever stolen
money from a cash drawer?

372
00:38:37,522 --> 00:38:38,814
Have you ever
stolen money...

373
00:38:38,898 --> 00:38:40,149
Enough of this crap.

374
00:38:40,233 --> 00:38:43,861
Take this thing off of me
right now. No job is worth this,

375
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:46,488
no matter how fat
the paycheck is.

376
00:38:47,157 --> 00:38:50,075
I'd rather spend the rest of
my career, or what's left of it,

377
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,202
in a broken-down
old ship,

378
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:56,707
than have someone sit
here and question my word.

379
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:33,744
Perfection.

380
00:39:35,163 --> 00:39:37,039
That's what it's about.

381
00:39:38,166 --> 00:39:39,833
It's those moments

382
00:39:41,336 --> 00:39:44,755
when you can feel the
perfection of creation,

383
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:51,970
the beauty of physics, you
know, the wonder of mathematics

384
00:39:52,055 --> 00:39:56,517
and the elation of
action and reaction,

385
00:39:56,601 --> 00:39:58,143
and that is the
kind of perfection

386
00:39:58,228 --> 00:40:00,187
that I want to
be connected to.

387
00:40:32,971 --> 00:40:35,764
You're sure this is
what you want, Galen?

388
00:40:36,266 --> 00:40:37,808
Yeah, I'm sure.

389
00:40:38,226 --> 00:40:41,562
I'm just tired of people,
humans, Cylons, whatever.

390
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:45,482
Last Raptor out tomorrow is gonna
drop me off on this island that I found

391
00:40:45,567 --> 00:40:47,317
off one of the
northern continents.

392
00:40:47,402 --> 00:40:49,903
It's cold. It's up
in the highlands.

393
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:52,906
There's no people.

394
00:41:05,795 --> 00:41:07,129
Good luck.

395
00:41:07,755 --> 00:41:09,381
For what it's worth,
if what happened

396
00:41:09,465 --> 00:41:10,716
to Cally had
happened to Ellen,

397
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,719
then I'd have done
the same frakking thing.

398
00:41:18,725 --> 00:41:19,808
Hmm.

399
00:41:31,404 --> 00:41:32,404
Hey!

400
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:33,906
Ah!

401
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:36,033
I thought Bill was coming.

402
00:41:36,117 --> 00:41:38,035
He's taking a leak.

403
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:40,037
Oh, nice.

404
00:41:40,121 --> 00:41:43,832
Hey, order me a drink,
honey, and keep them coming.

405
00:41:45,001 --> 00:41:47,836
Tonight we are
celebrating your retirement

406
00:41:47,921 --> 00:41:51,965
and all the time I'm about to
get to spend with my husband.

407
00:41:53,259 --> 00:41:55,135
Are you good
with that?

408
00:41:56,554 --> 00:42:00,974
Saul! All I've ever
wanted was to be with you.

409
00:42:02,143 --> 00:42:06,063
Not just weekend liberties
or a two weeks' leave a year.

410
00:42:06,147 --> 00:42:08,106
I mean full-time.

411
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:13,862
You and me, together
in a house, in a tent,

412
00:42:14,822 --> 00:42:16,949
homeless and
on the street.

413
00:42:18,034 --> 00:42:19,660
Just be together.

414
00:42:20,203 --> 00:42:21,411
Mmm-hmm.

415
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:23,664
Excuse me.

416
00:42:25,249 --> 00:42:26,249
Ah!

417
00:42:27,085 --> 00:42:28,585
Oh! Don't drop me!

418
00:42:29,587 --> 00:42:30,754
To us!

419
00:42:34,175 --> 00:42:35,258
Mmm!

420
00:42:36,427 --> 00:42:38,345
Yeah!

421
00:43:11,838 --> 00:43:14,589
There are so many.

422
00:43:15,633 --> 00:43:17,467
Wait, I wanna...

423
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:21,054
See more detail.

424
00:43:42,577 --> 00:43:43,785
It's

425
00:43:45,413 --> 00:43:48,457
a very beautiful world.

426
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:53,920
Does it have a name?

427
00:43:57,341 --> 00:43:58,341
Earth.

428
00:44:03,473 --> 00:44:05,015
It's not Earth.

429
00:44:06,768 --> 00:44:08,435
Earth is a dream.

430
00:44:11,105 --> 00:44:13,482
One we've been chasing for a long time.

431
00:44:15,735 --> 00:44:18,028
We've earned it.
This is Earth.

432
00:44:18,613 --> 00:44:19,946
Okay then.

433
00:44:20,823 --> 00:44:21,990
Earth.

434
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,494
It's fine.

435
00:44:28,081 --> 00:44:33,126
I'm having trouble
breathing.

436
00:44:53,022 --> 00:44:55,982
Would you like to get
a better look at them?

437
00:45:03,491 --> 00:45:06,243
Yes, I'd love it.

438
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:11,039
What... What
do you mean?

439
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,461
Watch.
What? Why?

440
00:45:16,546 --> 00:45:17,587
What are you doing?

441
00:45:17,672 --> 00:45:18,713
Watch me.

442
00:45:19,841 --> 00:45:22,008
What are you doing?
Put your arm around me.

443
00:45:22,093 --> 00:45:23,218
Can you?

444
00:45:59,213 --> 00:46:00,255
Dad?

445
00:46:00,882 --> 00:46:03,008
I don't have
much time, Son.

446
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:06,219
I understand.

447
00:46:24,071 --> 00:46:26,156
What do you
hear, Starbuck?

448
00:46:27,033 --> 00:46:28,825
Nothing but the rain.

449
00:46:29,285 --> 00:46:31,786
Grab your gun and
bring in the cat.

450
00:46:42,256 --> 00:46:43,757
You should go.

451
00:47:35,977 --> 00:47:38,979
You know, my very earliest
memory of my father

452
00:47:39,981 --> 00:47:42,482
was him flying away
on a big plane

453
00:47:45,361 --> 00:47:47,988
and wondering when
he was coming back.

454
00:47:52,785 --> 00:47:54,828
He's not coming
back this time.

455
00:47:54,912 --> 00:47:57,580
No, he's not.

456
00:48:03,671 --> 00:48:05,130
Neither am I.

457
00:48:07,758 --> 00:48:09,509
Where are
you going?

458
00:48:10,845 --> 00:48:12,304
I don't know.

459
00:48:13,639 --> 00:48:15,932
I just know that
I am done here.

460
00:48:17,977 --> 00:48:20,312
I've completed
my journey,

461
00:48:21,939 --> 00:48:23,440
and it feels good.

462
00:48:35,995 --> 00:48:37,329
You and I,

463
00:48:38,748 --> 00:48:40,123
right here,

464
00:48:41,542 --> 00:48:42,876
right now.

465
00:48:46,547 --> 00:48:48,006
On the table?

466
00:48:51,344 --> 00:48:52,719
I dare you.

467
00:48:54,305 --> 00:48:56,181
I double-dog
dare you.

468
00:48:57,183 --> 00:48:58,433
Double-dog dare?

469
00:48:58,517 --> 00:48:59,976
I double-dog
dare you.

470
00:49:01,604 --> 00:49:02,729
Hmm.

471
00:49:07,234 --> 00:49:08,568
All right.

472
00:49:30,883 --> 00:49:32,092
Oops!

473
00:49:32,301 --> 00:49:34,052
Something's broken.

474
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:55,198
I guess I better
get going.

475
00:49:58,119 --> 00:49:59,619
Yeah.

476
00:50:17,805 --> 00:50:19,764
It was nice
to meet you,

477
00:50:20,975 --> 00:50:22,308
Lee Adama.

478
00:50:29,525 --> 00:50:31,484
Likewise, Kara Thrace.

479
00:50:41,412 --> 00:50:43,079
So what about you?

480
00:50:45,124 --> 00:50:47,000
What are you gonna do?

481
00:50:48,043 --> 00:50:52,380
Today is the first day of
the rest of your life, Lee.

482
00:50:57,136 --> 00:50:58,219
Well,

483
00:51:00,431 --> 00:51:03,516
I always thought when
this was all done I would

484
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:06,853
kick back,

485
00:51:07,855 --> 00:51:09,022
relax,

486
00:51:10,399 --> 00:51:11,774
spend the rest
of my days doing

487
00:51:11,859 --> 00:51:14,486
the absolute minimum
humanly possible.

488
00:51:16,572 --> 00:51:18,573
And now that
you're here?

489
00:51:20,534 --> 00:51:22,202
I want to explore!

490
00:51:23,162 --> 00:51:25,288
I wanna climb the mountains.

491
00:51:25,956 --> 00:51:28,458
I wanna cross the oceans.
I wanna...

492
00:51:29,376 --> 00:51:30,543
Gods, I can't believe
I'm saying this.

493
00:51:30,628 --> 00:51:33,546
It sounds so exhausting.
I must be crazy...

494
00:51:56,987 --> 00:51:58,488
Goodbye, Kara.

495
00:52:02,243 --> 00:52:04,160
You won't be forgotten.

496
00:52:51,625 --> 00:52:53,626
Laura?
You okay?

497
00:53:09,143 --> 00:53:10,643
Hi.
Hi.

498
00:53:17,818 --> 00:53:20,028
Sean, it's been
a lovely evening.

499
00:53:20,112 --> 00:53:21,988
Really lovely.

500
00:53:22,072 --> 00:53:23,448
But what?

501
00:53:23,741 --> 00:53:26,659
But I'm afraid we won't
be doing this again.

502
00:53:27,828 --> 00:53:29,078
Did I...
No.

503
00:53:29,163 --> 00:53:31,789
No, no, not you.
No, you're wonderful.

504
00:53:32,374 --> 00:53:34,167
Come on, then...
No.

505
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:38,171
You can show
yourself out.

506
00:53:39,006 --> 00:53:40,340
I'm sorry.

507
00:53:40,549 --> 00:53:41,633
Wow.

508
00:53:43,052 --> 00:53:44,177
Okay.

509
00:54:26,887 --> 00:54:28,471
Hello, this is
Laura Roslin.

510
00:54:28,555 --> 00:54:33,351
I'd like you to give
a message to Mayor Adar.

511
00:54:34,395 --> 00:54:36,187
Tell him that I will

512
00:54:37,606 --> 00:54:39,565
be joining
his campaign.

513
00:54:40,234 --> 00:54:41,567
Thank you.

514
00:54:45,823 --> 00:54:47,740
All the way
to the end.

515
00:54:48,617 --> 00:54:50,159
No matter what.

516
00:54:51,370 --> 00:54:53,246
All the way
to the end.

517
00:54:59,753 --> 00:55:01,671
So much

518
00:55:03,757 --> 00:55:04,841
life.

519
00:55:07,344 --> 00:55:09,220
It's a rich continent.

520
00:55:15,269 --> 00:55:18,771
More wildlife than all the
12 Colonies put together.

521
00:55:30,451 --> 00:55:33,828
Just looking for a quiet
little place for that cabin.

522
00:55:37,791 --> 00:55:39,333
Maybe a garden.

523
00:55:40,252 --> 00:55:41,627
I don't have much of
a green thumb,

524
00:55:41,712 --> 00:55:43,963
so I hope that you do...

525
00:56:37,935 --> 00:56:39,310
Right there.

526
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:42,647
I'm gonna build it
right there, Laura.

527
00:57:46,878 --> 00:57:49,005
Lot of game
on this planet.

528
00:57:50,924 --> 00:57:52,508
I'm a pretty good hunter,
you know?

529
00:57:52,676 --> 00:57:54,260
Yeah, right.

530
00:57:54,344 --> 00:57:57,221
What are
you laughing at? What?

531
00:57:57,723 --> 00:57:59,515
That buck on Caprica.

532
00:58:00,225 --> 00:58:02,810
Okay, come on, now. That's not fair.

533
00:58:03,478 --> 00:58:07,106
Hey, don't you listen to
Mommy. Daddy is a great hunter.

534
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:09,609
No, Mommy's gonna
teach you how to hunt.

535
00:58:09,693 --> 00:58:11,569
No, no, no, no.
Real hunting.

536
00:58:11,653 --> 00:58:12,612
No.
Yeah.

537
00:58:12,696 --> 00:58:17,199
And I'm gonna teach you how to
build a house and how to plant crops.

538
00:58:17,618 --> 00:58:18,951
Okay, maybe Mommy
will teach you that,

539
00:58:19,036 --> 00:58:21,370
but Daddy's gonna
teach you how to hunt.

540
00:58:29,838 --> 00:58:30,921
Hera!

541
00:58:34,635 --> 00:58:35,718
Hera.

542
00:58:37,095 --> 00:58:38,971
Will she be
all right?

543
00:58:39,473 --> 00:58:42,058
She survived
thanks to you.

544
00:58:42,517 --> 00:58:43,893
Both of you.

545
00:58:44,895 --> 00:58:46,395
And that's it?

546
00:58:46,688 --> 00:58:48,814
That's all God
wants of us?

547
00:58:49,149 --> 00:58:51,359
God's plan is
never complete.

548
00:58:52,152 --> 00:58:53,277
Great.

549
00:58:53,362 --> 00:58:55,529
But I think
it's safe to say

550
00:58:55,906 --> 00:58:59,033
that from now on,
your lives will be less

551
00:59:00,118 --> 00:59:01,410
eventful.

552
00:59:41,576 --> 00:59:45,329
I've been thinking I may be
able to help you out after all,

553
00:59:46,456 --> 00:59:49,458
about that thing you
were asking about before,

554
00:59:51,670 --> 00:59:54,755
getting a peek into
the defense mainframe.

555
00:59:56,508 --> 00:59:58,008
That would mean
a lot to my employers.

556
00:59:58,093 --> 00:59:59,468
Yeah, well, I'm not doing
it for your employers.

557
00:59:59,553 --> 01:00:02,096
I'm doing it for you. How
would it make you feel?

558
01:00:04,599 --> 01:00:06,434
I'd be very grateful.

559
01:00:07,477 --> 01:00:09,603
We'll put that
to the test.

560
01:00:10,605 --> 01:00:14,150
Because if anyone finds out,
I could get my head cut off.

561
01:00:14,526 --> 01:00:16,944
So I'll count on
your discretion.

562
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:23,576
The things men
do for love.

563
01:00:24,494 --> 01:00:25,619
Love?

564
01:00:26,204 --> 01:00:27,371
Gaius!

565
01:00:28,999 --> 01:00:30,458
Yeah, well...

566
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:33,794
You know
what I mean, don't you?

567
01:00:50,061 --> 01:00:52,605
Over there, between those two peaks,

568
01:00:53,774 --> 01:00:56,776
I saw some terrain that
looked good for cultivation.

569
01:00:56,860 --> 01:00:58,277
Cultivation?

570
01:00:58,987 --> 01:01:00,029
Yes.

571
01:01:04,242 --> 01:01:06,535
You know, I know
about farming.

572
01:01:11,041 --> 01:01:12,124
Hey.

573
01:01:13,668 --> 01:01:14,877
I know.

574
01:01:22,719 --> 01:01:24,220
I know you do.

575
01:01:31,144 --> 01:01:33,229
I laid out
the cabin today.

576
01:01:34,022 --> 01:01:36,440
It's gonna have
an easterly view.

577
01:01:38,068 --> 01:01:40,903
You should see the
light that we get here.

578
01:01:40,987 --> 01:01:44,156
When the sun comes from
behind those mountains,

579
01:01:45,158 --> 01:01:46,951
it's almost heavenly.

580
01:01:49,788 --> 01:01:51,580
It reminds me of you.

581
01:02:52,392 --> 01:02:54,184
"At a scientific
conference this week

582
01:02:54,269 --> 01:02:56,729
"at the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington,

583
01:02:56,813 --> 01:02:58,355
"the startling announcement
was made

584
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:00,316
"that archeologists
believe they have found

585
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,526
"fossilized remains
of a young woman

586
01:03:02,611 --> 01:03:04,945
"who may actually
be Mitochondrial Eve.

587
01:03:05,447 --> 01:03:07,865
"Mitochondrial Eve is the
name scientists have given

588
01:03:07,949 --> 01:03:09,700
"to the most recent
common ancestor

589
01:03:09,784 --> 01:03:12,578
"for all human beings

590
01:03:12,787 --> 01:03:15,247
"She lived in what
is now Tanzania,

591
01:03:15,582 --> 01:03:18,208
"over 150,000
years ago. "

592
01:03:20,295 --> 01:03:22,379
Along with her Cylon mother

593
01:03:22,464 --> 01:03:23,631
and human father.

594
01:03:27,886 --> 01:03:31,430
Commercialism, decadence,
technology run amok.

595
01:03:32,098 --> 01:03:33,474
Remind you of anything?

596
01:03:33,558 --> 01:03:34,808
Take your pick.

597
01:03:35,477 --> 01:03:39,813
Kobol, Earth, the real
Earth, before this one.

598
01:03:41,107 --> 01:03:43,067
Caprica before
the fall.

599
01:03:43,777 --> 01:03:45,110
All of this has
happened before.

600
01:03:45,195 --> 01:03:47,196
But the question
remains.

601
01:03:48,448 --> 01:03:51,075
Does all of this
have to happen again?

602
01:03:51,159 --> 01:03:52,534
This time, I bet no.

603
01:03:52,619 --> 01:03:54,161
You know, I've never known
you to play the optimist.

604
01:03:54,245 --> 01:03:55,245
Why the change of heart?

605
01:03:55,330 --> 01:03:57,498
Mathematics, law of averages.

606
01:03:57,707 --> 01:04:00,084
Let a complex system
repeat itself long enough,

607
01:04:00,168 --> 01:04:03,045
eventually something
surprising might occur.

608
01:04:03,254 --> 01:04:05,381
That, too, is
in God's plan.

609
01:04:08,093 --> 01:04:10,594
You know it doesn't
like that name.

610
01:04:13,014 --> 01:04:14,306
Silly me.

611
01:04:15,392 --> 01:04:17,351
Silly, silly me.
