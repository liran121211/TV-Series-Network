00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,970
TWELVE CYLON MODELS

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,330
SEVEN ARE KNOWN

3
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,280
FOUR LIVE IN SECRET

4
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,750
ONE WILL BE REVEALED

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,150
Previously on Battlestar Galactica:

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,615
<i>The Threes, the D'Annas,</i>

7
00:00:25,715 --> 00:00:28,005
<i>they were boxed after the
battle on the algae planet.</i>

8
00:00:28,105 --> 00:00:29,115
<i>Why?</i>

9
00:00:29,215 --> 00:00:31,175
D'Anna saw the faces of the Final Five,

10
00:00:31,275 --> 00:00:34,180
<i>but if we unbox her, she can
reveal their identities to us.</i>

11
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,090
<i>The Final Five have been to Earth.</i>

12
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,355
If we help find them, they
can help us get there.

13
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:40,940
<i>So what could possibly
motivate us to trust you now?</i>

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,150
The boxing facility resides within
the Cylon resurrection hub.

15
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,180
<i>This hub controls the functions
of every resurrection ship.</i>

16
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,900
You destroy the hub, Cylons
lose their ability to download.

17
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,365
<i>The Hybrid on the baseship spoke of
an opera house and a dying leader.</i>

18
00:00:59,465 --> 00:01:01,385
We're going to talk to the Hybrid.

19
00:01:01,485 --> 00:01:03,565
And why would you require my presence?

20
00:01:03,765 --> 00:01:05,705
Because you're in my visions.

21
00:01:05,905 --> 00:01:09,330
<i>President Roslin was apparently
aboard the Cylon baseship,</i>

22
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:13,465
<i>along with Gaius Baltar and many of
Galactica's pilots when it jumped away.</i>

23
00:01:13,565 --> 00:01:14,620
Hub's gone.

24
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,385
<i>We're getting radiation
signatures from multiple nukes.</i>

25
00:01:17,485 --> 00:01:18,895
<i>Baseship fragments.</i>

26
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:21,530
<i>The president's baseship was destroyed.</i>

27
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,535
It's a different baseship.

28
00:01:23,635 --> 00:01:26,640
<i>Waiting alone in a raptor as
the rest of the fleet jump away,</i>

29
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,850
<i>well, that sounds a
lot like suicide, dad.</i>

30
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,370
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

31
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,950
<i>Because I can't live without her.</i>

32
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,580
TWO DAYS AGO

33
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,685
Plug it in.

34
00:01:59,785 --> 00:02:01,270
<i>I need to talk to it.</i>

35
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,830
- Let God's will be done.
<i>- Shut up.</i>

36
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,990
<i>It's time to get some answers.</i>

37
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,190
Jump!

38
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,000
Elosha.

39
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,270
Oh, my gods.

40
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,720
<i>Filters.</i>

41
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,416
<i>Filters, the sublime elevation
of the...</i>

42
00:02:57,466 --> 00:02:58,205
Why did it jump?

43
00:02:58,305 --> 00:02:58,995
Where are we?

44
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:00,755
I'm more concerned
about why we're here.

45
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,015
<i>...control, filters...</i>

46
00:03:03,515 --> 00:03:04,650
Why don't I talk to the Hybrid?

47
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,390
<i>Find out why.</i>

48
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,705
She can just do that.
She can just--

49
00:03:09,805 --> 00:03:10,580
Jump!

50
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,150
Will you walk with me?

51
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,000
Galactica.

52
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,030
It... what's going on?

53
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,800
- It's empty.
- It is.

54
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,750
Feels bigger this way, doesn't it?

55
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,095
It's so quiet.

56
00:03:37,195 --> 00:03:38,735
It's strange.

57
00:03:38,935 --> 00:03:41,850
A lot of things are strange.

Battlestar Galactica
Season 4 Episode 09

64
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,775
<i>Wing beats of a dove drown out the
heartbeats of those who follow.</i>

65
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,105
<i>The Six is back in the stream.</i>

66
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:49,175
That's unusual.

67
00:04:49,275 --> 00:04:50,590
To jump again so quickly.

68
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,365
What do you think it means?

69
00:04:53,465 --> 00:04:55,050
Look, it knows me.

70
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,845
It trusts me,

71
00:04:56,945 --> 00:04:58,290
<i>I think.</i>

72
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:02,130
I think it even likes me, 'cause I...

73
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,100
You're getting information
from this liquid?

74
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,755
The Hybrid is disorganized.
It's panicking.

75
00:05:08,855 --> 00:05:09,830
I don't know why.

76
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,245
Tell me.

77
00:05:11,345 --> 00:05:13,655
Why are you jumping the ship?

78
00:05:13,755 --> 00:05:15,165
The Six.

79
00:05:15,265 --> 00:05:18,415
<i>The Six who went among
the makers is no longer.</i>

80
00:05:18,515 --> 00:05:19,965
<i>End of line.</i>

81
00:05:20,065 --> 00:05:23,080
Back in the stream that feeds
the ocean that feeds the stream.

82
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:23,975
<i>The Six.</i>

83
00:05:24,075 --> 00:05:27,430
<i>She means Natalie, the
Six who was our leader.</i>

84
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,850
She's either been hurt or
killed back on Galactica.

85
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,885
That's why the Hybrid's panicking.

86
00:05:33,985 --> 00:05:35,510
So she's upset.

87
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,275
Okay, fine.

88
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:38,375
Can you...

89
00:05:38,475 --> 00:05:40,990
...calm her down?
Can you tell her to jump back?

90
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,625
It doesn't work like that.

91
00:05:42,725 --> 00:05:44,870
She makes her own decisions.

92
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:48,900
<i>And we can't unplug her because now
she's wired herself into life support.</i>

93
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,350
All right, then why
don't we give this a go?

94
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,780
Hey.

95
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,270
Hey, stop jumping the ship, all right?

96
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,885
Calm your mind.

97
00:06:01,985 --> 00:06:05,000
Cease countdown, cease countdown.

98
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:09,160
<i>Circulation, ventilation, control.</i>

99
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,415
<i>Filters.</i>

100
00:06:10,515 --> 00:06:13,190
<i>- Filters. The sublime elevation...</i>
- Did you see that?

101
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,855
I just opened myself up to it...

102
00:06:15,955 --> 00:06:17,600
- on a spiritual level...
<i>- Jump!</i>

103
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,920
Don't you just hate these people?

104
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:38,990
<i>No.</i>

105
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:42,960
Oh, but you don't love them either.

106
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,030
The people in this room are the closest
thing you've got to family, and you...

107
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:51,310
<i>You've been their president.</i>

108
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:58,230
<i>Watch them try to comfort each other.</i>

109
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:01,350
At least you haven't
taken that away from them....

110
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:03,035
yet.

111
00:07:03,135 --> 00:07:05,535
<i>You didn't rob them of their empathy...</i>

112
00:07:05,635 --> 00:07:07,430
<i>yet.</i>

113
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:11,280
<i>You just don't make room
for people anymore.</i>

114
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:15,520
You don't love people.

115
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,095
<i>Is that clear enough?</i>

116
00:07:18,195 --> 00:07:21,610
<i>Practical enough for
you, Madam President?</i>

117
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,560
I think we're going towards
the resurrection hub.

118
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,320
I think the mission is still on.

119
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,790
You sure there's no ETA at the hub?

120
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:48,730
No, the hub is jumping and
our Hybrid's jumping after it.

121
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:51,140
Sometimes we're showing up
six hours after it's moved on.

122
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,400
Sometimes, like, six minutes.

123
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,065
And one time it'll be within one
jump-length and we'll catch it.

124
00:07:56,165 --> 00:07:57,345
Yeah, but we don't know when.

125
00:07:57,445 --> 00:07:59,039
<i>So we'll have to assume
that any jump could be...</i>

126
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:01,240
<i>the one that just
drops us in next to it.</i>

127
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:08,580
They're gonna read our heat signatures
the second we fire up the first viper.

128
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,490
Hell, they'll read our electronics.

129
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:15,290
Yeah, if we could only mask that.

130
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,755
Go in cold.

131
00:08:18,855 --> 00:08:20,980
No electronics at all.

132
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:26,765
We'll send the vipers out
dead, towed by Cylon birds.

133
00:08:26,865 --> 00:08:27,925
They'll never see it coming.

134
00:08:28,025 --> 00:08:31,370
Take out the hub's jump drive,
then settle in for the long fight.

135
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,255
Yeah, good, okay, okay.

136
00:08:34,355 --> 00:08:35,840
But you and me, we've
got to get onto the hub

137
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,850
in the middle of that mess
and try to find D'Anna.

138
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,380
We can do this.

139
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,730
No, I-I don't know.

140
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:47,745
It's crazy, isn't it?

141
00:08:47,845 --> 00:08:50,150
We're putting ourselves
right where the action is.

142
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,705
It's not a great plan.

143
00:08:53,805 --> 00:08:55,360
There's no time.

144
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,080
Hey, let me help you.

145
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,795
Athena, my wife,
she learned to do that.

146
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,070
She never did that when I met her.

147
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,330
What?

148
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,190
I got curious about Athena.

149
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,600
About her and Hera and you.

150
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,955
So I accessed her,

151
00:09:41,055 --> 00:09:43,570
her memories from her last download.

152
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:47,260
You have her memories.

153
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,960
Yeah, and they're mine now too.

154
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:55,375
They're as real as my own.

155
00:09:55,475 --> 00:09:58,040
I know this must feel like a
violation of trust or something,

156
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:03,055
but I don't... I don't want
it to be strange, okay?

157
00:10:03,955 --> 00:10:04,970
Right.

158
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,060
Right, sure.

159
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,950
Madam President?

160
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,250
Sir?

161
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,735
Hope I didn't wake you.

162
00:10:28,835 --> 00:10:30,750
Uh, come in.

163
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,895
Thank you for the use
of your... your raptor.

164
00:10:41,995 --> 00:10:44,000
I needed some familiar surroundings.

165
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,925
Don't worry. I'll give it
back to Lt. Pike

166
00:10:46,025 --> 00:10:47,980
the second you need it.

167
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,640
About that.

168
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,720
This mission, it's very risky.

169
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,500
If there's even a chance that
we can go in and blow up

170
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,905
that hub and end Cylon resurrection
for all Cylons forever,

171
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:05,215
we must take it.

172
00:11:05,715 --> 00:11:08,100
I cannot back away from that.

173
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,945
Yes, sir.

174
00:11:11,345 --> 00:11:17,420
If and when D'Anna comes back
from the dead, bring her to me.

175
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:24,320
I think the Cylons think that she'll be
interrogated by both groups together.

176
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,030
I'm sure they do.

177
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,620
Bring her to me.

178
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:33,760
<i>She knows the identities of
the five Cylons in our fleet.</i>

179
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,305
It is a matter now of human security,

180
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:41,225
and I will not let the Cylons
have audience to that discussion.

181
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:43,770
I want to talk to her alone.

182
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,850
Yes, sir.

183
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,540
Good.

184
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,230
RESURRECTION HUB

185
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,220
<i>Welcome home, D'Anna.</i>

186
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,910
You told me I'd never have
to go through this again.

187
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:16,290
I lied.

188
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:21,180
You thought you were
putting me away forever.

189
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,210
So what changed?

190
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,585
War.

191
00:12:25,685 --> 00:12:28,305
A genuine Cylon civil war.

192
00:12:28,405 --> 00:12:32,615
Ones and Fours and Fives against
Twos and Sixes and Eights

193
00:12:32,715 --> 00:12:35,445
that objected to your retirement.

194
00:12:36,045 --> 00:12:39,605
Now your supporters are working with
humans against all the rest of us.

195
00:12:40,205 --> 00:12:41,860
All in your name.

196
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,290
Boomer's an Eight.

197
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,740
Shouldn't she be on the other side?

198
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,820
Boomer's my pet Eight.

199
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,400
She's seen the light of reason.

200
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,290
And an Eight can make a passionate ally.

201
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:07,250
Till she sees something shiny.

202
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,715
Why'd you bring me back anyway?

203
00:13:12,815 --> 00:13:18,200
I brought you back to heal us,
sister, and end this shameful war.

204
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,595
Since Cylon pilots don't use call signs,

205
00:13:27,695 --> 00:13:30,555
we're gonna be painting unique
identifiers on all their birds.

206
00:13:31,055 --> 00:13:32,360
That's a relief.

207
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,490
You address them, use that number, okay?

208
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,020
Should've scrubbed
this frakkin' mission.

209
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,150
Hey, everyone, listen up.

210
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,420
Now these heavy raiders aren't
like the other raiders.

211
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,315
They aren't gonna make any
hinky moves on their own.

212
00:13:42,415 --> 00:13:44,460
They're under the
control of their pilots.

213
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,520
The Cylon pilots are in
charge of their birds.

214
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,455
Oh, now there are tiny
pilots inside of them?

215
00:13:48,555 --> 00:13:49,805
We do our jobs.

216
00:13:49,905 --> 00:13:51,630
Training is just as good as yours.

217
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,215
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

218
00:13:53,515 --> 00:13:57,290
Twenty-some of you I've
taken out weren't that good.

219
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,790
<i>Redwing.</i>

220
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,810
Redwing!

221
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,460
<i>Now let's talk about
the surprise element.</i>

222
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:09,110
First wave of vipers are gonna ride in,
engines cold, DRADIS and comm off, okay?

223
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:12,090
You're gonna come in towed by
cables from the heavy raiders.

224
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,315
- We're rigging 'em up now.
- Captain, don't...

225
00:14:14,415 --> 00:14:17,135
Now, I mean, if they're
all tied together here,

226
00:14:17,235 --> 00:14:18,915
kissing their gasholes so to speak,

227
00:14:19,015 --> 00:14:20,125
and they tap on the brakes,

228
00:14:20,225 --> 00:14:22,035
we're gonna smash right
in the back of them.

229
00:14:22,135 --> 00:14:23,050
They won't.

230
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,765
It'll work, you guys. Really.

231
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:27,510
When you're close enough,
the cable's gonna disconnect.

232
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,495
We're mounting small
explosive charges to cut it.

233
00:14:29,595 --> 00:14:30,950
Hold it, hold it.

234
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,690
We cut the cable, right?

235
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,475
Cylon pilots cut the cable.

236
00:14:34,575 --> 00:14:37,300
<i>Then you sling out of their
birds and you turn your power on.</i>

237
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,420
You're gonna be gunning
directly at the hub's FTL.

238
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,505
Then it's an all-out fight until we
can get in there with the nukes.

239
00:14:42,605 --> 00:14:45,860
Yeah, so if the Cylons don't lift
up, and then we're toast, right?

240
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,790
No, look, I'm serious.

241
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:50,350
Hey, hey!

242
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,565
Pilots!

243
00:14:51,665 --> 00:14:53,255
You've flown with Cylons.

244
00:14:53,355 --> 00:14:55,005
You've flown with Athena.

245
00:14:55,105 --> 00:14:57,700
You put your life in her hands
and she hasn't betrayed you.

246
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,070
Well, I am the same as her.

247
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:07,370
Now all of these Cylons here, all of
these people, they're pilots like you.

248
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:11,275
And they're gonna be out in the soup
with you taking out other Cylons,

249
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:14,300
just like Athena does
every time she's asked to.

250
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:22,880
And when that hub is taken out,
all of their lives will be at risk.

251
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,610
<i>Just like yours.</i>

252
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:27,770
<i>So you might want to think about
how you're gonna work together.</i>

253
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,020
Because we're all dead if you don't.

254
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,370
<i>Moving on.</i>

255
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,450
<i>Just go and ask it already.</i>

256
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,180
I've been told that you said
something about an opera house,

257
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,975
and I--
Because it seems pointless.

258
00:15:45,075 --> 00:15:46,485
Look, there was an opera house.

259
00:15:46,585 --> 00:15:47,475
An opera house.

260
00:15:47,575 --> 00:15:48,640
Are you listening to me?

261
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,825
Apparently I was in the opera house.

262
00:15:50,925 --> 00:15:51,940
I had a vision.

263
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,805
I was chasing after a little girl.

264
00:15:53,905 --> 00:15:55,070
I came to a door.

265
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:58,810
I saw Dr. Baltar and
the Six take the child.

266
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:01,865
<i>- ...close the doors. Protect the child.</i>
- And-- She's not listening.

267
00:16:01,965 --> 00:16:03,570
- 'Protect the child.'
<i>Protect the child.</i>

268
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,585
She said, 'protect the child.'
That's what Caprica said.

269
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,570
You told me I was the
one holding the child,

270
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:10,340
so obviously I was the one
protecting the child, wasn't I?

271
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,965
- In the opera house...
- No. No, no.

272
00:16:12,065 --> 00:16:14,285
It wasn't at all clear
what you were doing.

273
00:16:14,385 --> 00:16:15,005
Let me listen.

274
00:16:15,105 --> 00:16:16,260
Booting up.

275
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,635
I mean, obviously you've done
this a thousand times before.

276
00:16:19,735 --> 00:16:21,480
Well, I'm just doing the
same thing you're doing.

277
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,765
No, you're not actually.

278
00:16:22,865 --> 00:16:23,420
No, you're not.

279
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,615
Because if you'll watch what I'm doing,

280
00:16:24,715 --> 00:16:27,665
what I'm doing is I'm actually
focusing on her, all right?

281
00:16:27,965 --> 00:16:30,750
Now tell us what happened in
the opera house now, all right?

282
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:33,085
Oh, the only thing
you're doing is yelling.

283
00:16:33,185 --> 00:16:34,615
Such a format will close the doors.

284
00:16:34,715 --> 00:16:36,920
'Close the doors.' No, no, open
the door. Open the door.

285
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,325
I want to open the door!

286
00:16:38,425 --> 00:16:39,675
Do it again, do it again, do it again!

287
00:16:39,775 --> 00:16:41,315
I'm going for a walk.

288
00:16:41,415 --> 00:16:42,405
Love to see you do any better.

289
00:16:42,505 --> 00:16:43,220
All right, I'll do it.

290
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,185
Open the door!

291
00:16:44,285 --> 00:16:45,665
Three!

292
00:16:45,765 --> 00:16:47,125
<i>The Three is online.</i>

293
00:16:47,225 --> 00:16:48,210
<i>The Three is online.</i>

294
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,085
The Three is online.

295
00:16:49,185 --> 00:16:49,735
The Three is online.

296
00:16:49,835 --> 00:16:50,895
- Accessing data. </i></i>
- The Three is D'Anna.

297
00:16:50,995 --> 00:16:51,555
<i>Loading data.</i>

298
00:16:51,655 --> 00:16:52,865
D'Anna is online.

299
00:16:52,965 --> 00:16:54,555
Oh, D'Anna's in a body.

300
00:16:54,655 --> 00:16:55,515
D'Anna's back in a body.

301
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:57,060
Booting up... jump!

302
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,740
<i>Why are we doing this again?</i>

303
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,925
I don't want to see this again.

304
00:17:14,425 --> 00:17:16,419
The ancients used to
say 'a people is only...

305
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:18,725
as strong as the body of its leader.'

306
00:17:19,525 --> 00:17:21,181
If I follow that thought,

307
00:17:22,931 --> 00:17:26,405
are you saying that humanity
died because I died?

308
00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:31,795
If you're my subconscious, I've gotta
say you're a little full of myself.

309
00:17:32,195 --> 00:17:34,500
Humanity didn't die because you did.

310
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,025
The ancients, they got
a lot of things wrong.

311
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:39,995
The body of a people is not the
same as the body of its leader.

312
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,175
But the soul and the spirit might be.

313
00:17:42,275 --> 00:17:44,905
Oh, I see, so you're only
laying morality at my feet.

314
00:17:45,005 --> 00:17:46,955
Well, that's okay.
I can take that.

315
00:17:47,005 --> 00:17:49,985
I mean, there are a lot of people
who have sins far greater than mine.

316
00:17:50,385 --> 00:17:52,570
You're thinking of Gaius Baltar.

317
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:56,505
<i>'...then I dug into the
stump and pulled rocks...</i>

318
00:17:56,605 --> 00:17:58,875
<i>'from the ground until my fingers bled.'</i>

319
00:17:58,975 --> 00:18:02,305
'I collected seeds from the few
fruits the island offered,'

320
00:18:02,405 --> 00:18:07,415
<i>'and planted them in long, straight
furrows, like the ranks of soldiers.</i>

321
00:18:07,515 --> 00:18:09,615
<i>'When I finished, I looked
at what I had done.</i>

322
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:11,325
<i>'I did not see a garden.</i>

323
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:12,715
<i>'I saw a scar.</i>

324
00:18:12,815 --> 00:18:18,650
<i>'This island had saved my life,
and I had done it no service.'</i>

325
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:38,080
I can see a real hierarchy around here.

326
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:42,140
And I have to tell you, you're on the
lower end of the scale, my friend.

327
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,010
Yes, you are.

328
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:48,220
Which is odd when you think
about the Cylon god, because--

329
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,590
They told you about God, didn't they?

330
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,323
I'm not even really sure if
the Hybrid was referring to D'Anna,

331
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,520
but if it's true...

332
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,315
It certainly would make it easier.

333
00:19:05,415 --> 00:19:06,710
<i>How so?</i>

334
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,100
Well, we...

335
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,350
wouldn't have to find a...

336
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,480
find a body.

337
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,300
Yes, good.

338
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,560
Okay.

339
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,450
Go get her and bring her here.

340
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,510
Something else?

341
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:31,345
It's just, once you have what she knows,

342
00:19:31,445 --> 00:19:34,090
<i>I can't help feeling like you could
try to keep Earth for humans only</i>

343
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:37,730
<i>and I just--
Madam President, that doesn't seem...</i>

344
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,680
What?

345
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,645
Honest.

346
00:19:41,745 --> 00:19:43,885
You're supposed to be
conducting a fair deal here,

347
00:19:43,985 --> 00:19:46,015
and instead you're taking
D'Anna off by yourself.

348
00:19:46,115 --> 00:19:47,255
Taking what she knows.

349
00:19:47,355 --> 00:19:48,665
Slow down, captain.

350
00:19:48,765 --> 00:19:53,765
At best, D'Anna knows the
identities of the Cylons in our fleet,

351
00:19:53,865 --> 00:19:57,450
and at best, they know a way to Earth.

352
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,060
So you're not denying you'd keep the
way to Earth to yourself if you could.

353
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,095
I'm not saying that's true.

354
00:20:05,195 --> 00:20:07,676
I will say that if the
Cylons had the option,

355
00:20:07,776 --> 00:20:11,100
<i>that's exactly, exactly</i>
what they would do.

356
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,405
No, I don't think so.

357
00:20:17,005 --> 00:20:19,470
Not the Sharons, the Eights.

358
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:21,995
Captain,

359
00:20:22,695 --> 00:20:26,915
you are not married to the
entire production line.

360
00:20:27,015 --> 00:20:30,515
<i>I cannot afford to be
sentimental right now,</i>

361
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:33,595
<i>and I cannot afford you
to be sentimental either.</i>

362
00:20:33,795 --> 00:20:37,870
If you can't do this job,
find me someone who can.

363
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,630
What is that?

364
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,090
I think we're there.

365
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,940
Something's going on.

366
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,305
Another baseship, unscheduled.

367
00:20:55,405 --> 00:20:57,588
You've gotta speak to
the Twos and Sixes and Eights

368
00:20:57,688 --> 00:20:59,990
and tell them
they've gone too far.

369
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:01,615
No.

370
00:21:01,715 --> 00:21:04,380
Why don't you ask about the Final Five?

371
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,185
<i>You never ask about them.</i>

372
00:21:06,385 --> 00:21:08,630
That's because I don't believe
we're meant to know them.

373
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,790
Well, I'll tell you.

374
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:14,330
I will tell you.
I'll start shouting out their names.

375
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,645
Why do you risk it?

376
00:21:16,745 --> 00:21:19,600
Are you going to help end
this war or are you useless?

377
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:24,190
25 heavy raiders just launched from
the new arrival, heading our way.

378
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:32,720
Come on, let's get this carpool started.

379
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,905
Now!

380
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:49,730
Cut the frakkin' cable
now, you frakkin' bastard!

381
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,450
Oh, the inhibition's been lifted.

382
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,540
Oh, I sense it.

383
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,500
<i>It's the rebel baseship.</i>

384
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,340
I think they're gonna attack.

385
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,510
They're gonna blow the hub.

386
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:18,280
That would be mass murder.

387
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,240
Death would be permanent for all of us.

388
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,920
They've gone insane.

389
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,900
Permanent death?

390
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,410
Well, that makes this
all the more meaningful.

391
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,705
<i>Helo, we've blown their FTL.</i>

392
00:22:56,805 --> 00:22:58,230
<i>That hub's not going anywhere.</i>

393
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:00,110
Okay, take us down.

394
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,685
Well, he's your God as well.

395
00:23:13,985 --> 00:23:16,405
And God doesn't want any
of his creations to be...

396
00:23:17,505 --> 00:23:18,960
slaves.

397
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:23,780
Not that you're a slave...

398
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,050
exactly.

399
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,320
Go.

400
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:11,240
This place is gonna go.
Grab her.

401
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,440
Run!

402
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,800
<i>Hardball, Pike. I'm hit.</i>

403
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:26,820
My attitude control is down, and I can't
even program any frakkin' ordnance.

404
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,420
Pike, Hardball.

405
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,590
<i>Man, don't jump.</i>

406
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:30,895
<i>You'll never make it to Galactica.</i>

407
00:24:30,995 --> 00:24:32,540
<i>You know how many jumps that is?</i>

408
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:34,310
I'm out of here.

409
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:36,200
Okay, I'm jumping back home.

410
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,140
Karl.

411
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,020
Come on, let's go.

412
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,170
<i>Go!</i>

413
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,808
<i>There was this dog, see,
and the master had...</i>

414
00:25:23,908 --> 00:25:26,795
placed a bit of food on
the edge of its snout.

415
00:25:27,695 --> 00:25:30,860
And the dog had to wait until
he was told he could eat it.

416
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:37,170
I know. Pathetic. Pathetic, isn't it?

417
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:44,000
Put him over there.

418
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,580
Wait!

419
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,000
Easy, Smith. Easy, easy.

420
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,180
Okay.

421
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,760
Find out what's going on!

422
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:55,990
Yes, sir.

423
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,805
- Thank you.
- Okay.

424
00:27:01,905 --> 00:27:04,150
<i>- Thank you, thank you.</i>
<i>- Good.</i>

425
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,630
<i>Okay, wait.</i>

426
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,520
<i>Okay.</i>

427
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,600
<i>Sorry.</i>

428
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:22,050
You have this...

429
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:25,740
You have this big hole
in your hide, as Cottle would say.

430
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,415
Okay.

431
00:27:27,515 --> 00:27:28,360
All right.

432
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,500
I'm gonna do this again.

433
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,810
Thank you.

434
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,370
It's the least I can do.

435
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:36,080
<i>I think you're gonna live,</i>

436
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:36,885
<i>as usual.</i>

437
00:27:36,985 --> 00:27:38,330
You know something?

438
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,335
What?

439
00:27:40,435 --> 00:27:42,010
You're very pretty.

440
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,675
<i>Man, that morpha works fast.</i>

441
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:48,130
Still.

442
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,530
Do you know why I'm so serene right now?

443
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,460
You're doped out of your mind?

444
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,170
<i>Because I know God.</i>

445
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:00,735
You need God, Laura.

446
00:28:01,435 --> 00:28:03,300
Really, you'd be a different woman.

447
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,490
<i>I know God.</i>

448
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,130
Therefore, I know myself.

449
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:11,280
Truth is...

450
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:17,240
I was harboring the most
awful, desperate guilt.

451
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,890
A heavy, dark,

452
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,510
unimaginable,

453
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:26,170
soul-breaking guilt.

454
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,130
Now it's gone.

455
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,610
Now it's gone, it's...

456
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,680
been transformed into--

457
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,760
I have been transformed.

458
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,510
<i>What was your guilt about?</i>

459
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,150
I have no guilt.

460
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,790
What was your guilt about?

461
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,010
I gave the access codes to the Cylons.

462
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:05,230
They wiped out most of humanity.

463
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:13,810
<i>Of course, I didn't know that's what
I was doing at the time exactly,</i>

464
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:15,215
but that's what I did.

465
00:29:15,315 --> 00:29:20,740
And when I realized what
I had done, the magnitude.

466
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:23,730
In that moment, I was saved.

467
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,185
I was loved...

468
00:29:27,985 --> 00:29:29,710
by God.

469
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,030
Looking back,

470
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,450
I think I was rewarded.

471
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,650
Rewarded.

472
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:46,050
Pythia talks about the flood
that wiped out most of humanity.

473
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:48,845
<i>Nobody blames the flood.</i>

474
00:29:49,945 --> 00:29:52,040
<i>A flood is a force of nature.</i>

475
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,390
<i>Through the flood, mankind
is rejuvenated, born again.</i>

476
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:03,250
I was another flood, you see.

477
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,445
I blamed myself.

478
00:30:06,545 --> 00:30:08,280
<i>I blamed myself,</i>

479
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:12,290
<i>but God made the man
that made that choice.</i>

480
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,000
<i>God made us all perfect.</i>

481
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,933
And in that thought,

482
00:30:22,683 --> 00:30:24,580
all my guilt flies away,

483
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,480
flies away like a bird.

484
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:33,720
<i>I can give you that peace,
Laura, that freedom.</i>

485
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:38,050
Pray with me.

486
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,170
Pray with me.

487
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,960
Okay.

488
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:44,340
Thank you.

489
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:46,960
Okay.

490
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:18,690
<i>What are you doing?</i>

491
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,110
<i>What are you doing?</i>

492
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:21,545
It's all right.

493
00:31:21,645 --> 00:31:22,740
You're fine.

494
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,955
Don't do this to me.

495
00:31:28,055 --> 00:31:30,030
Don't do this to me, please.

496
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,925
<i>We have D'Anna on board.</i>

497
00:31:51,025 --> 00:31:52,510
<i>We are clear of the hub.</i>

498
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,190
<i>Commence nuclear strike.</i>

499
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,220
<i>Repeat, nuclear strike is a go.</i>

500
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:31,620
And with a whimper, every Cylon
in the universe begins to die.

501
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,820
<i>Yes, that's right.</i>

502
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:37,300
<i>And it's a good thing, D'Anna,</i>

503
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,990
because now there's no difference.

504
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,190
We can all start trusting each other.

505
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,270
<i>Don't do this to me.</i>

506
00:32:57,190 --> 00:33:00,460
<i>Don't... don't do this to me.</i>

507
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:03,970
Don't do this to me, please.

508
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,475
Please.

509
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:14,790
No...

510
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:23,560
I'm not saying Baltar's done more
good than harm in the universe.

511
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,775
He hasn't.

512
00:33:24,875 --> 00:33:27,282
<i>The thing is,
the harder it is to recognize</i>

513
00:33:27,382 --> 00:33:29,275
<i>someone's right to draw a breath,</i>

514
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:31,205
<i>the more crucial it is.</i>

515
00:33:31,905 --> 00:33:34,790
If humanity is going to prove
itself worthy of surviving,

516
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:37,630
it can't do it on a case-by-case basis.

517
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,000
A bad man feels his death
just as keenly as a good man.

518
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:47,500
<i>What do you want from me here?</i>

519
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:49,440
Laura.

520
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:51,780
Just love someone.

521
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:55,690
Love.

522
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:18,960
<i>You go.</i>

523
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:23,030
You go.

524
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,620
You go to your rest now.

525
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,060
I'm not gonna be selfish anymore.

526
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,950
<i>You go.</i>

527
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,770
<i>Rest.</i>

528
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,610
No.

529
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:29,830
No, please, no.

530
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,260
Stop bleeding.

531
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,980
Stop the bleeding, stop the bleeding.

532
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,460
<i>Okay, good.</i>

533
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,170
<i>Don't go.</i>

534
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:51,190
<i>All right, we've gotta get
D'Anna to the control room.</i>

535
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,430
No, that's not the plan.

536
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:55,570
What?

537
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:57,080
<i>What plan?</i>

538
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:58,930
Interesting.

539
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:05,030
Please don't go, Gaius.

540
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,720
Please...

541
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,450
I don't know how...
All right, put it in.

542
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,380
I have to take her
directly to the president.

543
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,145
No one else.

544
00:36:16,245 --> 00:36:17,210
That wasn't the deal.

545
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:20,510
I'm just doing what she
told me to do, okay?

546
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:23,285
<i>Double dealing.</i>

547
00:36:23,685 --> 00:36:24,595
It's very human.

548
00:36:24,695 --> 00:36:26,410
You never got that, Eight.

549
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,000
No more.

550
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,820
No more, don't go.

551
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:35,750
Please don't die.

552
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:42,140
Live, please.

553
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:44,530
Don't go.

554
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:50,415
I'm not saying I agree.

555
00:36:50,515 --> 00:36:52,240
I'm saying it's my orders.

556
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:00,020
So I pretty much just made a
prize fool of myself, didn't I?

557
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,020
Trust.

558
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,640
Can we go find the president now?

559
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,440
Gaius?

560
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,800
Gaius, it's me.

561
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,470
The hub's been destroyed.

562
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:47,930
Good.

563
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,205
Don't let anyone in here,

564
00:37:52,305 --> 00:37:53,960
whatever it takes.

565
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,240
Thank you.

566
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,520
He's injured, but I think
he's going to survive.

567
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:08,150
I think it's gonna be a
long time jumping back.

568
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,740
I've got time.

569
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:16,535
<i>Is that right?</i>

570
00:38:16,735 --> 00:38:19,160
<i>Well, you went to a lot of
trouble to bring me here,</i>

571
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,790
deceiving your so-called allies.

572
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,395
I suppose you've got
some questions for me.

573
00:38:28,495 --> 00:38:29,860
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

574
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:33,620
I'd like to talk about the
five Cylons in my fleet.

575
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,470
So you know about the Final Five.

576
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:40,690
I know they're supposed
to know the way to Earth.

577
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:45,480
But you don't know that
you're one of them?

578
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,520
<i>Look at your face!</i>

579
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,115
<i>Oh, it's ridiculous!</i>

580
00:38:59,215 --> 00:39:01,415
<i>No, look, I'm not
giving you any names.</i>

581
00:39:01,515 --> 00:39:03,620
<i>Not until I feel like I'm safe.</i>

582
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:06,540
'Cause information is
all I got, sweetie.

583
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,670
I'm mortal now.

584
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,725
In fact, I'm the only Three
in the whole darn universe,

585
00:39:15,825 --> 00:39:18,230
so I gotta worry about
protecting myself.

586
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,474
<i>I'll tell you who the Final Five are</i>

587
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:24,845
<i>when you take me back to your fleet.</i>

588
00:39:25,845 --> 00:39:27,362
<i>Oh, and by the way, Laura,</i>

589
00:39:28,112 --> 00:39:29,465
I would've said the same thing

590
00:39:29,565 --> 00:39:32,145
if you'd have met me with
a whole lot of Cylons,

591
00:39:32,545 --> 00:39:34,650
'cause I don't trust anyone right now.

592
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:37,812
So all this deception,

593
00:39:37,863 --> 00:39:40,290
<i>complete waste of time.</i>

594
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:49,285
<i>To remove the pump with the
attached hose and wiring,</i>

595
00:39:49,385 --> 00:39:51,235
<i>simultaneously release the three tangs</i>

596
00:39:51,335 --> 00:39:55,070
<i>while pulling the pump out of the
<i>retainer along with the line and wiring.

597
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,170
You lied to me.

598
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,250
Did I?

599
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:10,600
I thought I was earning
humanity's right to survive.

600
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:14,805
It's not a vending machine, Laura.

601
00:40:14,905 --> 00:40:16,235
You don't save a life, and then...

602
00:40:16,335 --> 00:40:18,940
cue the celestial trumpets,
'here's the way to Earth.'

603
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,120
I know.

604
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,750
Jump!

605
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:26,210
Disorienting, isn't it?

606
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:29,525
All these little limping steps back.

607
00:40:30,225 --> 00:40:31,970
I like it.

608
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:34,500
I'm used to it.

609
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:38,610
Every jump brings us a
little bit closer to home.

610
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:40,920
Galactica.

611
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:44,210
My home.

612
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:52,800
Maybe there's something there for me.

613
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:57,330
Maybe even closer.

614
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,890
Missed you.

615
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,300
Me too.

616
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,910
I love you.

617
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:51,870
About time.
