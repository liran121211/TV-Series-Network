1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,470
TWELVE CYLON MODELS

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,740
SEVEN ARE KNOWN

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,630
FOUR LIVE IN SECRET

4
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:19,290
ONE WILL BE REVEALED

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,115
Previously on Battlestar Galactica:

6
00:00:22,596 --> 00:00:24,296
"Thus shall it come to pass."

7
00:00:24,687 --> 00:00:27,487
"The dying leader shall know the truth
of the opera house."

8
00:00:27,632 --> 00:00:29,632
Where did you hear that?
Who told you that?

9
00:00:29,942 --> 00:00:31,942
The Hybrid. On the baseship,
before they unplugged it.

10
00:00:32,602 --> 00:00:34,602
I've got to find out
about these visions.

11
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,000
Plug it in.

12
00:00:37,077 --> 00:00:39,077
It's time to get some answers.

13
00:00:39,836 --> 00:00:41,836
Can I see what you drew?

14
00:00:45,303 --> 00:00:46,503
Hera?

15
00:00:51,807 --> 00:00:53,407
Get away from my child!

16
00:00:53,726 --> 00:00:55,726
You are never gonna take her.

17
00:01:00,384 --> 00:01:01,384
JUMP!

18
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:07,516
-Make Way! Make Way!
<i>-Father.</i>

19
00:01:10,543 --> 00:01:11,543
Give me the strength...

20
00:01:13,569 --> 00:01:14,569
Let's come along, come along.</i></i>

21
00:01:16,966 --> 00:01:18,566
<i>Let's go.</i>
<i>Watch it, watch it.</i>

22
00:01:18,663 --> 00:01:20,663
<i>Bay 2! Doc!
Coming your way!</i>

23
00:01:21,226 --> 00:01:22,726
Quickly.

24
00:01:22,981 --> 00:01:24,181
All right.

25
00:01:24,309 --> 00:01:26,609
On three:
One, two three.

26
00:01:26,896 --> 00:01:27,896
Lift.

27
00:01:28,972 --> 00:01:31,572
<i>Keep some pressure on that wound
until I can get to the artery.</i>

28
00:01:32,127 --> 00:01:33,127
<i>Mask on.</i>

29
00:01:36,576 --> 00:01:37,776
Kidnapped?
President--

30
00:01:37,882 --> 00:01:39,482
Baltar?
I heard Baltar was with her.

31
00:01:39,631 --> 00:01:41,031
Are you saying he's responsible?

32
00:01:41,139 --> 00:01:43,639
- I heard it was the Cylons.
- No. My people say she was shot.

33
00:01:43,691 --> 00:01:45,191
What are you talking about?
Roslin?

34
00:01:45,267 --> 00:01:47,367
Now, one of Adama's Marines
shot a Cylon,

35
00:01:47,422 --> 00:01:48,922
and that is how this entire
thing has begun.

36
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,770
- So then where is Zarek?
<i>- I don't know!</i>

37
00:01:50,894 --> 00:01:52,694
<i>- Where is Zarek</i>
<i>- Who is in charge here?</i>

38
00:01:52,755 --> 00:01:54,755
<i>Sir, Vice President Zarek is
still waiting to talk to you.</i>

39
00:01:54,862 --> 00:01:56,662
What should I tell him?
Sir?

40
00:01:59,885 --> 00:02:02,885
Deckard says they've just shipped over
the last of the Vipers,

41
00:02:02,981 --> 00:02:05,681
means we're down to 40 birds
and almost as many jocks.

42
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,720
We're gonna have to reconfigure
the CAP, rethink our defense posture.

43
00:02:10,412 --> 00:02:12,412
Where is she?

44
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,550
- Marines are holding her.
- My quarters.

45
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
<i>- Nobody has told us anything.</i>
<i>No, no, no.</i>

46
00:02:19,123 --> 00:02:20,523
All right, everybody.
Please calm down.

47
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,974
Mr. Vice President,
I have some questions for you.

48
00:02:23,449 --> 00:02:24,849
Thank you.
Just calm down, please.

49
00:02:25,143 --> 00:02:28,043
<i>Everybody!
Everybody just calm down, please.</i>

50
00:02:28,656 --> 00:02:30,656
<i>Mr. Vice President,
it's really important that we know.</i>

51
00:02:31,059 --> 00:02:32,459
Is the President dead?

52
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:33,758
We...We have no information--

53
00:02:33,908 --> 00:02:35,367
I heard she was assassinated by the Cylons.

54
00:02:35,469 --> 00:02:37,669
No, there is no truth to that,
at least as far as we know.

55
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,790
But then what the hell
do we know?

56
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,140
Clearly, our first priority is
to get out as much

57
00:02:42,219 --> 00:02:45,019
verifiable information
as we can to avoid exaggeration--

58
00:02:45,116 --> 00:02:46,140
<i>But what is it that--?</i>

59
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:50,216
To that end, I asked Admiral Adama
to come and answer our questions directly.

60
00:02:50,332 --> 00:02:52,932
Unfortunately, he wouldn't
take my call.

61
00:02:54,181 --> 00:02:56,081
<i>- At this time, when there is--</i>
<i>- However...</i>

62
00:02:56,366 --> 00:02:59,066
However...please.
Please, just a moment.

63
00:03:01,256 --> 00:03:03,256
<i>...on the right.</i>

64
00:03:07,428 --> 00:03:10,128
<i>President Roslin is apparently
aboard the Cylon baseship,</i>

65
00:03:10,802 --> 00:03:13,502
along with Gaius Baltar and
many of Galactica's pilots

66
00:03:13,581 --> 00:03:14,667
when it jumped away,

67
00:03:14,817 --> 00:03:17,981
after one of their own leaders
<i>was shot aboard Galactica.</i>

68
00:03:18,555 --> 00:03:21,155
We have no idea when or if
they'll return,

69
00:03:21,302 --> 00:03:24,902
or if the President or the other
captives will be subject to reprisals.

70
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,719
For now, the powers granted me by law,

71
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:45,790
I have taken over as President.

72
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,880
<i>Hear, hear.</i>

73
00:04:10,652 --> 00:04:12,360
By refusing even to meet with Zarek,

74
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:15,152
you're simply helping him
fan the Quorum's suspicions.

75
00:04:15,315 --> 00:04:17,215
Their suspicions don't concern me.

76
00:04:17,304 --> 00:04:19,404
<i>Look, maybe he's not
the man we hoped for,</i>

77
00:04:19,495 --> 00:04:23,395
but he is next in line, and the fleet
needs reassurance and stability

78
00:04:23,448 --> 00:04:25,948
exactly the kind that only its
military commander can offer.

79
00:04:26,049 --> 00:04:28,749
If this fleet needs reassurance,
then you reassure them.

80
00:04:29,379 --> 00:04:31,779
<i>That's your job now.
You can tell Zarek,</i>

81
00:04:31,857 --> 00:04:33,857
he can go to hell.

82
00:04:37,407 --> 00:04:39,907
- Why?
- Sir...?

83
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:44,988
Do you hate your people so much
that you look for any excuse to kill one?

84
00:04:45,049 --> 00:04:48,249
What, did you deliberately try
to sabotage this truce?

85
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:50,256
No sir. Of course not.

86
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,949
Then you tell me why.

87
00:04:53,902 --> 00:04:56,102
You make me understand
why you did this.

88
00:05:00,102 --> 00:05:01,702
They were gonna take her.

89
00:05:01,815 --> 00:05:03,315
The Six.

90
00:05:03,781 --> 00:05:05,781
She was gonna take my child.

91
00:05:07,856 --> 00:05:09,656
There were too many witnesses.

92
00:05:09,736 --> 00:05:11,436
They all said the same thing:

93
00:05:11,532 --> 00:05:13,276
Your daughter was lost.

94
00:05:13,326 --> 00:05:16,632
The Cylon merely kneeled down,
was talking to her.

95
00:05:16,742 --> 00:05:18,442
Maybe that's what it looked like
to the others, sir.

96
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,350
- But I know.
- Oh, you knew better...?

97
00:05:20,462 --> 00:05:24,862
I had a vision, a vision where the Six
and Baltar were taking her away from me.

98
00:05:25,149 --> 00:05:26,649
A vision.

99
00:05:28,855 --> 00:05:30,355
It was more than just a vision, sir.

100
00:05:30,504 --> 00:05:32,604
When I saw them together, I knew
that they would take her,

101
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,120
that they would take away
my child!

102
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:39,110
You murdered her.
An unarmed woman, and by doing so,

103
00:05:39,234 --> 00:05:42,434
you put the lives of every
single person in this fleet at risk.

104
00:05:43,714 --> 00:05:47,514
And quite possibly cost the lives
of the President and your husband.

105
00:05:47,624 --> 00:05:50,624
You disobeyed the direct orders
of a superior officer,

106
00:05:51,898 --> 00:05:53,498
but more importantly,

107
00:05:54,986 --> 00:05:56,986
you betrayed a promise to me.

108
00:05:58,628 --> 00:06:00,628
I trusted you.

109
00:06:03,257 --> 00:06:06,257
Sir, I will accept any form of punishment
that you think I deserve.

110
00:06:08,194 --> 00:06:10,494
I just ask that you please
don't take away Hera.

111
00:06:11,054 --> 00:06:15,054
I'm afraid the brig
is no place for a little girl.

112
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,180
Guards!

113
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,750
- Get her out of my sight.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

114
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:29,069
At one time, Admiral Adama supported
Gaius Baltar's administration.

115
00:06:29,408 --> 00:06:30,808
Isn't there a chance he'd support yours?

116
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,440
I'm afraid only Admiral Adama
can answer that.

117
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:35,831
<i>Then I will address this question
to delegate Adama.</i>

118
00:06:36,621 --> 00:06:40,221
Do you honestly think that your father
will hand over power to this administration?

119
00:06:44,925 --> 00:06:45,925
No.

120
00:07:12,301 --> 00:07:14,701
39,674 SURVIVORS

121
00:07:16,571 --> 00:07:18,971
IN SEARCH OF A HOME

122
00:07:19,324 --> 00:07:21,324
CALLED EARTH

123
00:07:25,254 --> 00:07:28,254
Transcript by rogard, with a
little help from others. Thanks guys.

124
00:07:31,007 --> 00:07:34,007
Battlestar Galactica
Season 4 Episode 8

125
00:07:35,448 --> 00:07:38,448
"Sine Qua Non"

126
00:07:39,505 --> 00:07:41,805
Fine.
Yeah.

127
00:07:42,601 --> 00:07:45,601
Recon Raptor just reported back.
The Resurrection Hub's gone.

128
00:07:46,601 --> 00:07:48,235
No sign of the base ship
carrying the President,

129
00:07:48,285 --> 00:07:50,501
assuming that's where they were headed.

130
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,790
They were determined to
resurrect the Three,

131
00:07:54,066 --> 00:07:56,066
what we used to call D'Anna.

132
00:07:56,825 --> 00:07:59,425
To do that, they gotta go
to a hub.

133
00:07:59,822 --> 00:08:01,822
If we find it, we'll find them.

134
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:04,459
- Easier said than done.
- Maybe.

135
00:08:04,897 --> 00:08:06,297
We got another problem, sir.

136
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:09,977
Starbuck's having trouble fielding
enough planes to fly a standard CAP.

137
00:08:10,211 --> 00:08:12,511
Wants us to consider having the fleet
bunched up tighter,

138
00:08:12,641 --> 00:08:14,641
so it's easier to defend.

139
00:08:15,531 --> 00:08:18,831
Means counting on a bunch of
civvies flying close formation.

140
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,943
<i>Yeah...</i>

141
00:08:21,372 --> 00:08:22,972
Organize it.

142
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,361
I got you appointed...

143
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:33,251
to this job. I pulled strings,

144
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:39,150
called in favours, all because
I thought you might do some good.

145
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,340
Now you're advising me
to step aside from a position

146
00:08:45,362 --> 00:08:48,162
that by law...is mine.

147
00:08:49,188 --> 00:08:51,488
A position I was elected to.

148
00:08:51,575 --> 00:08:53,375
But you were never elected president.

149
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,192
But I was elected to office,

150
00:08:56,342 --> 00:08:59,030
which is more than Roslin can claim.

151
00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:04,576
Why do you think she kept me on
in the first place?

152
00:09:05,601 --> 00:09:07,901
To thank me for rolling over?
No.

153
00:09:09,497 --> 00:09:12,097
No, to help legitimize her coup.

154
00:09:12,992 --> 00:09:14,692
In the military,

155
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:18,822
we used to talk about
facts on the ground.

156
00:09:18,938 --> 00:09:21,038
Well, the facts on the ground
are these:

157
00:09:21,118 --> 00:09:24,618
Right or wrong, Adama will never
recognize you as president,

158
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,322
and we need someone he will.

159
00:09:26,372 --> 00:09:28,735
Now the Quorum has a legal authority

160
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:31,001
to appoint an interim president
in a time of crisis.

161
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,530
And I suppose you have someone in mind?

162
00:09:35,163 --> 00:09:36,163
No.

163
00:09:36,793 --> 00:09:39,893
No, not yet, Whis is why we need
to form a search committee

164
00:09:40,498 --> 00:09:43,498
and start looking for candidates
as soon as possible.

165
00:09:44,783 --> 00:09:47,583
Well...
good luck with that.

166
00:09:51,277 --> 00:09:52,178
<i>Mr. Vice President, sir.</i>

167
00:09:52,228 --> 00:09:53,977
<i>You don't believe this
government's in danger?</i>

168
00:09:54,047 --> 00:09:55,347
<i>Let's face facts here.</i>

169
00:09:55,486 --> 00:09:57,486
<i>What we had these past five years
isn't a true government,</i>

170
00:09:57,548 --> 00:10:01,548
<i>but a tacit agreement between a
military strongman and a political strongwoman</i>

171
00:10:01,673 --> 00:10:02,978
<i>to rule together by fiat.</i>

172
00:10:03,128 --> 00:10:04,692
<i>I've heard you asked
the Quorum to authorize</i>

173
00:10:04,742 --> 00:10:07,073
<i>the creation of a civil defense force?</i>

174
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,630
<i>After what happened during the
last military coup,</i>

175
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:12,769
<i>we don't want to depend on Galactica's</i>
<i>marines to guarantee our safety.</i>

176
00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:18,459
You see the problem?

177
00:10:21,461 --> 00:10:23,461
Lampkin's first rule of
legal dynamics:

178
00:10:24,814 --> 00:10:29,114
When an irresistible force
meets an immovable object,

179
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:32,829
stand aside.

180
00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:36,789
Might call for a class action suit.

181
00:10:37,038 --> 00:10:40,038
Except I'm not sure if it's to
anyone's benefit if we just sit around,

182
00:10:40,702 --> 00:10:42,702
waiting to pick up the pieces.

183
00:10:43,578 --> 00:10:46,378
This thing's heading for a showdown.
There's gonna be bloodshed, unless--

184
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:49,930
Unless you can find someone else,
someone your father won't reject,

185
00:10:50,485 --> 00:10:52,485
someone the Quorum would approve of,

186
00:10:52,878 --> 00:10:56,578
someone to take Tom Zarek's place
as Interim President

187
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,660
until the next round of elections.

188
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,060
Don't take the case, Counselor.

189
00:11:05,767 --> 00:11:07,767
It's a loser.

190
00:11:08,575 --> 00:11:10,075
I have to.

191
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:12,137
<i>We have to.</i>

192
00:11:16,136 --> 00:11:18,936
<i>No one on the Quorum is going
to lift a finger.</i>

193
00:11:20,196 --> 00:11:23,496
Zarek's got them inhaling fear
and exhaling anger.

194
00:11:23,602 --> 00:11:27,602
But you have taken the pulse of
the fleet and you know character.

195
00:11:28,059 --> 00:11:30,859
And frankly, you need a reason
to get out of this room,

196
00:11:31,164 --> 00:11:34,464
unless you want to start discussing
what's been keeping you here.

197
00:11:42,272 --> 00:11:44,572
So you won't be dissuaded, will you?

198
00:11:46,353 --> 00:11:48,353
Not even when you hear my fee?

199
00:11:50,064 --> 00:11:51,064
Fee?

200
00:11:51,126 --> 00:11:54,226
Appearances to the contrary,
I'm actually in this for the money.

201
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,375
I have a reputation to
maintain after all.

202
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,441
Okay, so what did Roslin offer
you to defend Baltar?

203
00:12:01,266 --> 00:12:03,266
Room with a view.

204
00:12:04,026 --> 00:12:06,026
I'm not sure I can
improve on that.

205
00:12:06,943 --> 00:12:08,943
<i>Then pro bono <i>it is, Counselor.</i></i>

206
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:11,697
Words of the wise:

207
00:12:12,038 --> 00:12:14,638
"Sometimes it's better to settle
for what you've already got."

208
00:12:21,956 --> 00:12:23,356
<i>Colonel Tigh.</i>

209
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,900
I understand you've developed a
relationship with the Cylon prisoner.

210
00:12:28,619 --> 00:12:32,019
That's not the word I'd use, but she
has been more cooperative.

211
00:12:33,022 --> 00:12:35,722
See if she'll tell you
anything about the Hub.

212
00:12:40,508 --> 00:12:41,508
Bill.

213
00:12:42,764 --> 00:12:45,764
We'll find her.
We'll find all of them.

214
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,180
Your Resurrection Hub.
How do we find it?

215
00:12:57,288 --> 00:12:58,688
I'm sure the others have told you.

216
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:00,244
You tell me.

217
00:13:04,327 --> 00:13:06,327
Only our Hybrids can locate it.

218
00:13:06,407 --> 00:13:08,407
And then only after it completes a jump.

219
00:13:08,547 --> 00:13:10,547
Even they can't anticipate
where it's going.

220
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,630
You're holding back something.
I know it.

221
00:13:13,615 --> 00:13:16,515
<i>- You're lying.</i>
- I have never lied to you, Saul.

222
00:13:17,038 --> 00:13:18,032
Why don't you trust me now?

223
00:13:18,082 --> 00:13:20,538
Because there are too many
lives at stake, lady.

224
00:13:20,608 --> 00:13:22,608
Your buddies took off with
half an air wing,

225
00:13:22,705 --> 00:13:25,205
not to mention the President
of the frakking Colonies herself.

226
00:13:26,592 --> 00:13:29,092
She's the real reason
you're so angry, so worried.

227
00:13:29,206 --> 00:13:31,206
I can hear it in
your voice.

228
00:13:31,305 --> 00:13:34,605
Why? Why is a dying woman
so important to you?

229
00:13:34,924 --> 00:13:36,924
Not to me, godsdamnit.
To the old man.

230
00:13:38,678 --> 00:13:40,178
Admiral Adama?

231
00:13:54,674 --> 00:13:55,424
Saul.

232
00:13:56,474 --> 00:13:58,274
- Do you love me?
- What?

233
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,800
Be honest with me.
I've been honest with you.

234
00:14:00,925 --> 00:14:02,425
I don't believe this.

235
00:14:03,786 --> 00:14:05,786
You're asking me--

236
00:14:06,651 --> 00:14:08,651
<i>Attention. Set Condition One
throughout the ship</i>

237
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,972
<i>This is not a drill.</i>
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

238
00:14:10,022 --> 00:14:11,540
This has gone too frakkin' far.

239
00:14:11,594 --> 00:14:14,594
I don't know what kind of mind games
you are playing with me, lady,

240
00:14:14,675 --> 00:14:16,075
but it ends here!

241
00:14:25,466 --> 00:14:26,466
What do we got?

242
00:14:26,587 --> 00:14:28,987
One of our missing Raptors
jumped into DRADIS range.

243
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:30,401
You're sure it's ours?

244
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,736
Transponder checks out, it's one of
the Raptors that boarded the rebel baseship.

245
00:14:34,128 --> 00:14:35,589
No radiological signature.

246
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:38,428
Racetrack and Skulls are on their way
to intercept.

247
00:14:40,048 --> 00:14:42,548
Actual, Racetrack.
I'm eyeballing our bird now.

248
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:46,149
Looks shot to hell.
Venting fuel and O2.

249
00:14:47,781 --> 00:14:49,781
Still no response to hails.

250
00:14:50,722 --> 00:14:52,722
Someone had to jump that bird.

251
00:14:55,064 --> 00:14:57,064
I can't see a fracking thing from here.

252
00:14:58,451 --> 00:15:00,951
Skulls, take the wheel,
I'm going for a walk.

253
00:15:09,964 --> 00:15:12,164
<i>Decompression check okay.
Opening hatch.</i>

254
00:15:23,112 --> 00:15:25,712
<i>Safety line secured.
Moving toward the Raptor.</i>

255
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,416
<i>I see major damage to the canopy.</i>

256
00:15:45,324 --> 00:15:46,824
<>Looks empty inside.</i>

257
00:16:02,998 --> 00:16:04,698
<i>I have the hatch open
but it's stuck.</i>

258
00:16:07,111 --> 00:16:08,611
<i>Grav field's off.</i>

259
00:16:13,629 --> 00:16:14,929
<i>It's Pike.</i>

260
00:16:15,888 --> 00:16:16,888
<i>Dead.</i>

261
00:16:41,975 --> 00:16:43,975
[Searider Falcon]

262
00:16:46,738 --> 00:16:49,738
This is the shuttle
she took over to the baseship.

263
00:16:50,974 --> 00:16:53,674
Laird was able to salvage
the flight data recorder,

264
00:16:53,754 --> 00:16:56,954
puts the originating jump point
deep in sector delta 9.

265
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,550
'President' Zarek called again.
He heard about the Raptor,

266
00:17:01,675 --> 00:17:03,275
and he's waiting to be briefed.

267
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:06,256
Recall the CAP.
Spin up the FTLs.

268
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:08,818
- What about the fleet?
- Let's go.

269
00:17:08,872 --> 00:17:10,872
We are essentially looking for
an understudy.

270
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:14,710
Quandary is, one doesn't generally
get the chance...

271
00:17:14,816 --> 00:17:18,816
...to wield political power without the
ambition to actively seek it.

272
00:17:19,314 --> 00:17:20,614
<i>Easy, Lance.</i>

273
00:17:21,102 --> 00:17:23,662
<i>That same ambition
often compromises...</i>

274
00:17:23,712 --> 00:17:26,802
<i>...the unselfish motives
that begat the quest.</i>

275
00:17:27,526 --> 00:17:31,226
In other words, a battle of "id"
vs."ego", that "ego" rarely wins.

276
00:17:33,024 --> 00:17:34,524
Roslin never sought power.

277
00:17:34,617 --> 00:17:36,617
Exception that proves
the rule.

278
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:41,010
One could argue that Laura Roslin is
a study in repressed ambition.

279
00:17:41,551 --> 00:17:43,551
Just like you, Mr. Adama.

280
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,430
Never seeking out a job
until it's handed to you.

281
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:50,934
Flight leader, Battlestar commander,
Quorum delegate.

282
00:17:51,002 --> 00:17:53,902
A man doesn't carve out a path
like that through life without--

283
00:17:54,013 --> 00:17:55,813
All right, enough of this
psychoanalysis.

284
00:17:55,884 --> 00:17:57,884
Let's get back to the job
in hand.

285
00:18:00,023 --> 00:18:03,023
Does your father have some another
place he wants to go?

286
00:18:04,172 --> 00:18:05,172
What?

287
00:18:08,452 --> 00:18:10,452
Where the hell did they go?

288
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:12,459
<i>And why didn't they tell us?</i>

289
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,275
<i>Galactica, Racetrack.</i>

290
00:18:34,925 --> 00:18:36,795
<i>We've located the source
of the transponder.</i>

291
00:18:37,472 --> 00:18:39,472
It's Sandmans's viper all right.

292
00:18:39,638 --> 00:18:42,438
<i>- But there's no Sandman's</i>
- Affirmative. Keep searching.

293
00:18:46,921 --> 00:18:49,921
We're getting radiation signatures
from multiple nukes.

294
00:18:50,049 --> 00:18:52,117
Baseship fragments, other debris...

295
00:18:52,267 --> 00:18:54,249
...indicative of Resurrection technology.

296
00:18:56,075 --> 00:18:58,075
I'm afraid it paints
a pretty clear picture.

297
00:19:00,871 --> 00:19:02,871
They found the Hub
and they destroyed it.

298
00:19:04,922 --> 00:19:06,922
Looks like our pilots.
question is, where did they go from here.

299
00:19:09,036 --> 00:19:11,336
Oh, Bill.
You are way too close to this.

300
00:19:12,256 --> 00:19:14,256
<i>The President's baseship
was destroyed.</i>

301
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,375
It's a different baseship.

302
00:19:16,486 --> 00:19:19,086
<i>We'll search every square inch
of this debris field</i>

303
00:19:19,222 --> 00:19:20,722
<i>until we come up with a clue.</i>

304
00:19:20,825 --> 00:19:22,825
What, and leave the rest
of the fleet back there...

305
00:19:22,957 --> 00:19:24,757
...with their asses
hanging in the wind?

306
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,166
Detail four Raptors
to stay behind.

307
00:19:28,288 --> 00:19:31,288
They'll keep searching
until they find something concrete.

308
00:19:31,425 --> 00:19:33,025
<i>Give my order.</i>

309
00:19:41,316 --> 00:19:43,716
<i>Hey people, listen up.
What are we gonna do here?</i>

310
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,030
- They've left 39,000 lives...
- All right, everybody. Gather round please.

311
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:48,102
<i>-...completely undefended.</i>
<i>- Gather round.</i>

312
00:19:48,245 --> 00:19:50,745
- Uh, Mr. President.
- Please, please, please.

313
00:19:50,876 --> 00:19:53,876
<i>I'm sorry, Admiral Adama will not
be coming to answer your questions.</i>

314
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:57,020
I did learn however, that they've
contacted the fleet's captains...

315
00:19:57,088 --> 00:19:59,988
...to inform them that several of
their ships will be requisitioned...

316
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:03,479
...to expand the search for Laura
Roslin and the missing baseship.

317
00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:07,049
<i>while our tylium shipments will be
diverted to support that mission.</i>

318
00:20:07,138 --> 00:20:09,138
How do they bypassing us completely?

319
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:11,251
I understand. I understand.
We're doing the best--

320
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,030
I understand. We're trying to get
through communications--

321
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:16,129
- That is unconscionable!
<i>- That makes no sense.</i>

322
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:18,230
- Come on.
<i>- That is nothing short of--</i>

323
00:20:18,365 --> 00:20:19,565
Captain Franks.

324
00:20:20,305 --> 00:20:22,049
I was impressed by her gravitas

325
00:20:22,199 --> 00:20:25,005
during her turn as judge
in the Baltar trial.

326
00:20:25,423 --> 00:20:27,023
Got no vote,
naturally.

327
00:20:27,148 --> 00:20:29,248
Yeah. She's already been
approached to run for office.

328
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,333
No interest in politics.

329
00:20:31,393 --> 00:20:33,393
Sadly, now she really
impresses me.

330
00:20:35,164 --> 00:20:36,164
Gods!

331
00:20:36,398 --> 00:20:37,898
You ever feed that animal?

332
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,120
Where is he anyway?

333
00:20:43,587 --> 00:20:45,587
<i>Come on, Romo.
Let's put our heads together.</i>

334
00:20:46,498 --> 00:20:48,498
<i>Who would Adama respect
as President?</i>

335
00:20:49,943 --> 00:20:51,643
What does this...

336
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:54,335
...search for paragons
matters anyway.

337
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:57,047
It's a greater guilt
to their own failings.

338
00:20:57,321 --> 00:20:58,521
Or worse.

339
00:20:58,662 --> 00:21:00,662
The idiot's illusion
of the clean slate.

340
00:21:01,124 --> 00:21:03,124
- Fresh start.
- Whoa! Whoa!

341
00:21:03,214 --> 00:21:04,714
We haven't ruled out
all these names yet.

342
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,972
This one's a loser.
An exercise in futility.

343
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:20,951
How is this gonna affect the
President? The break in her treatment.

344
00:21:21,303 --> 00:21:23,303
Assuming no other changes in
her circumstances?

345
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:24,582
Yes.

346
00:21:24,644 --> 00:21:26,044
Well, diloxin really kicks
your ass,

347
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:28,367
so she actually might
feel better at first.

348
00:21:28,437 --> 00:21:30,837
But any break gives the cancer
a chance to regroup,

349
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:32,889
makes it that much harder to
beat it back,

350
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,950
plus she's taken a hit to
her immune systems

351
00:21:35,051 --> 00:21:37,051
so she'll be vulnerable
to infections.

352
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:40,231
How long?

353
00:21:40,484 --> 00:21:42,684
Well, let's just say, that the
sooner you get her back here,

354
00:21:42,766 --> 00:21:44,466
the better her chances are.

355
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,550
And while you're
digesting that,

356
00:21:49,233 --> 00:21:50,733
I have some other news.

357
00:21:50,859 --> 00:21:52,859
I ran some tests on your
Cylon prisoner.

358
00:21:54,849 --> 00:21:56,849
Guess what I've found.

359
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:02,448
Raptors are due back in a few hours.

360
00:22:03,028 --> 00:22:06,628
Granted, if they'd found anything, we
would have heard about that by now.

361
00:22:07,635 --> 00:22:10,735
- Still, once we correlate their reports--
- I'm not interested...

362
00:22:11,525 --> 00:22:13,925
-...in the search.
- You're not?

363
00:22:14,072 --> 00:22:16,872
I know that you've been spending
a lot of time interrogating the Six,

364
00:22:20,658 --> 00:22:23,658
but now the brig guards tell me that
every time you order them out.

365
00:22:24,724 --> 00:22:26,424
And you turn off the cameras.

366
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:29,845
I'm not torturing her, if that's
what you're worried about.

367
00:22:29,939 --> 00:22:31,439
I'm not.

368
00:22:31,522 --> 00:22:34,322
That I could almost understand.
This I can't.

369
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:39,256
Cottle tells me she's pregnant.

370
00:22:41,146 --> 00:22:43,146
<i>What the frak have you been
thinking here, colonel?</i>

371
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,548
Do you deny it?

372
00:22:49,162 --> 00:22:50,762
You don't.

373
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:53,203
You can't!

374
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:56,406
<i>What the hell have you
been thinking?</i>

375
00:22:56,747 --> 00:22:58,347
Who was interrogating whom?

376
00:22:58,444 --> 00:23:00,444
<i>How many of our secrets have
you told this thing?</i>

377
00:23:00,537 --> 00:23:03,237
How can you even ask me that?
Question my loyalty?

378
00:23:03,899 --> 00:23:06,599
Your loyalty?
I need more than your loyalty.

379
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,080
You're my first officer.
I need judgment.

380
00:23:10,735 --> 00:23:12,435
I need your competence,

381
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,150
<i>I'm through jeopardizing this ship,</i>

382
00:23:15,294 --> 00:23:16,894
<i>putting it at risk because
of your weaknesses.</i>

383
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,539
- My weaknesses?
- Yeah, your weaknesses!

384
00:23:18,629 --> 00:23:20,329
<i>You're risking all our lives
for what?</i>

385
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:22,841
Our missing pilots?
No, for a woman!

386
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,280
For a frakkin' woman!

387
00:23:24,334 --> 00:23:26,334
You watch what you frakking
say about that woman!

388
00:23:26,851 --> 00:23:30,151
She's the President, not some
frakking skinjob that I've been banging.

389
00:23:30,247 --> 00:23:31,947
What do you think
Ellen would say about all this?

390
00:23:32,029 --> 00:23:33,129
Leave Ellen out of this.

391
00:23:33,183 --> 00:23:34,883
What do you think Ellen would
say about her husband

392
00:23:35,015 --> 00:23:37,515
impregnating a frakking
Cylon prisoner?

393
00:23:37,586 --> 00:23:39,086
You motherfrakker!

394
00:24:06,849 --> 00:24:09,849
You know how many times
I had to repair this thing?

395
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:28,531
What are you gonna do
with that woman?

396
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:35,030
What are you gonna do about Laura,
if you ever find her?

397
00:24:38,524 --> 00:24:40,124
I don't know.

398
00:25:01,484 --> 00:25:04,984
Have the Raptors and the civilian
ships begin the search

399
00:25:05,084 --> 00:25:07,084
from Phantom's last known position.

400
00:25:09,128 --> 00:25:11,128
Is that a problem?

401
00:25:12,217 --> 00:25:13,478
Sir, respectfully...

402
00:25:14,628 --> 00:25:16,317
I've already got two
missing pilots

403
00:25:16,407 --> 00:25:18,407
and hardly enough birds
left to protect this fleet.

404
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:20,810
Now you're asking me to send the
remains of the Raptors out

405
00:25:20,917 --> 00:25:23,917
on a blind search looking for a ship
that very well may have been destroyed.

406
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,320
My people are gonna feel like they're
being asked to go on suicide missions.

407
00:25:27,439 --> 00:25:29,139
I'm not asking.

408
00:25:31,752 --> 00:25:33,752
You're dismissed, captain.

409
00:25:48,118 --> 00:25:49,918
<i>...bunch of Sixes...</i>

410
00:25:51,436 --> 00:25:53,136
<i>Admiral Adama?</i>

411
00:25:58,867 --> 00:26:00,667
Mr. Lampkin, what are
you doing here?

412
00:26:05,984 --> 00:26:09,584
Writs of forfeiture for the
ships you borrowed.

413
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:13,935
The captains want to be absolved of any
blame should anything untoward happen.

414
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:18,770
One of the less ennobling consequences
of a legal culture:

415
00:26:19,657 --> 00:26:21,657
No one wants responsibility.

416
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:27,770
Lee said you once gave him
something before a mission.

417
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:30,019
A lighter, was it?

418
00:26:32,388 --> 00:26:36,588
It belonged to my father.
Foolish to think a hunk of metal...

419
00:26:36,985 --> 00:26:38,485
...can keep 'em safe.

420
00:26:38,675 --> 00:26:40,675
And yet, that's what we do, isn't it?

421
00:26:41,435 --> 00:26:43,035
Hang on to hope,

422
00:26:43,647 --> 00:26:46,647
in every hopelessly irrational
way that we can.

423
00:26:48,133 --> 00:26:51,533
But not like those poor bastards,
giving away their luck,

424
00:26:51,661 --> 00:26:53,661
<i>just when they need it most.</i>

425
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:56,230
<i>It's like they've given up.</i>

426
00:26:58,525 --> 00:27:02,525
If you've never been in combat,
you have no idea what they're thinking.

427
00:27:02,767 --> 00:27:05,567
I always imagined you were
a realist, Admiral,

428
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:09,224
not one to indulge a vain hope
at the cost of lives.

429
00:27:11,811 --> 00:27:15,311
But then...
everyone has his limits.

430
00:27:16,948 --> 00:27:18,948
<i>Sine qua non, as they say.</i>

431
00:27:19,291 --> 00:27:22,091
- "Without which not".
<i>- Yes.</i>

432
00:27:22,301 --> 00:27:25,401
<i>Those things we deem essential,
without which we cannot bear living,</i>

433
00:27:25,466 --> 00:27:30,466
<i>without which life in general
loses its specific value,</i>

434
00:27:31,273 --> 00:27:33,273
<i>becomes abstract.</i>

435
00:27:34,805 --> 00:27:36,805
You may have a point, Counselor.

436
00:27:37,084 --> 00:27:39,084
And while I'm on a roll:

437
00:27:40,497 --> 00:27:43,197
Tom Zarek may not be
an ideal president,

438
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:47,079
but we could do worse.

439
00:27:48,315 --> 00:27:50,015
You're right.

440
00:27:50,779 --> 00:27:53,279
There are limits to
my realism.

441
00:27:56,029 --> 00:27:58,029
Good bye, Counselor.

442
00:28:06,401 --> 00:28:08,401
I can't give up on her.

443
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:11,210
I can't let her go.

444
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:14,319
I've lost my objectivity,

445
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:21,229
and now that I see that,
I have no choice.

446
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:26,119
Tell the Quorum that I am relinquishing
command, effective immediately.

447
00:28:31,324 --> 00:28:32,924
<i>No man is perfect.</i>

448
00:28:33,307 --> 00:28:36,307
No man is less perfect than a
candidate for high office.

449
00:28:38,268 --> 00:28:39,668
Thus...

450
00:28:42,149 --> 00:28:45,149
the ranks of likely suspects
is winnowed to none.

451
00:28:48,443 --> 00:28:50,443
What if we're going about
this backwards, hey, Lance?

452
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,140
What if instead of picking names
and finding fault,

453
00:28:56,351 --> 00:29:00,951
we'd ask ourselves the qualities
that we want, no,

454
00:29:01,433 --> 00:29:02,633
<i>...that we need...</i>

455
00:29:02,711 --> 00:29:05,711
...in your chief executive,
see who fits that bill.

456
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:10,045
Honesty, of course.

457
00:29:10,164 --> 00:29:12,964
Wisdom to recognize.
Correct.

458
00:29:13,073 --> 00:29:16,073
If unpopular choice,
as well as the courage...

459
00:29:16,209 --> 00:29:17,709
...to see it through.

460
00:29:17,836 --> 00:29:19,436
Experience.

461
00:29:21,437 --> 00:29:24,737
When the wrong choices cost lives
and the right ones save.

462
00:29:25,144 --> 00:29:27,144
It's all harder.

463
00:29:31,897 --> 00:29:34,297
I might as well just
spell out one name.

464
00:29:38,199 --> 00:29:39,599
Just one.

465
00:29:41,389 --> 00:29:43,389
One we knew from the start.

466
00:29:50,327 --> 00:29:52,327
Sometimes you take
on a losing case

467
00:29:53,586 --> 00:29:55,586
and you make yourself a believer.

468
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:59,290
Other times,
no matter what you tell yourself,

469
00:30:04,388 --> 00:30:08,388
in your heart you know
the outcome is fixed,

470
00:30:09,986 --> 00:30:11,986
and the verdict inevitable.

471
00:30:14,507 --> 00:30:16,907
<i>Lance.
Defense rests.</i>

472
00:30:20,537 --> 00:30:22,037
<i>C'mon.</i>

473
00:30:30,973 --> 00:30:32,473
Apologies.

474
00:30:32,988 --> 00:30:35,388
- I couldn't wait to tell you.
- Tell me what?

475
00:30:35,441 --> 00:30:37,059
We found our candidate.

476
00:30:37,109 --> 00:30:39,841
Someone the Quorum won't
hesitate to approve,

477
00:30:39,895 --> 00:30:41,895
even against Zarek's objections.

478
00:30:41,979 --> 00:30:44,979
Someone the Admiral can't
help but accept.

479
00:30:46,206 --> 00:30:48,206
Yeah? Who?

480
00:30:50,036 --> 00:30:52,036
Congratulations,
Mr. President.

481
00:30:53,579 --> 00:30:55,379
My name was never on that list.

482
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:58,488
Of course not!
That would be too blatant.

483
00:30:59,036 --> 00:31:02,436
But it is everything you
always wanted, isn't it?

484
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,400
Why you had me cross 47
names off that list?

485
00:31:07,047 --> 00:31:08,447
Come on...

486
00:31:08,778 --> 00:31:10,278
admit it.

487
00:31:10,912 --> 00:31:13,612
Savour your victory,
Mr. Adama,

488
00:31:14,311 --> 00:31:17,311
'cause you'll never get
the chance to serve.

489
00:31:23,847 --> 00:31:25,147
- What are you doing?
- Why?

490
00:31:25,229 --> 00:31:27,229
'Cause you're perfect for the job,
of course.

491
00:31:27,908 --> 00:31:30,908
'cause after the vicious separation
that was Baltar's presidency,

492
00:31:30,998 --> 00:31:33,998
and the bitter disappointment
that was Roslin's,

493
00:31:34,124 --> 00:31:37,624
you are a shining beacon of hope.

494
00:31:38,059 --> 00:31:40,859
Only hope is the last thing we need.

495
00:31:40,971 --> 00:31:42,937
We're a doomed race,
and it's time

496
00:31:43,087 --> 00:31:45,571
that we made our peace with
that essential truth.

497
00:31:45,693 --> 00:31:47,493
Romo, what the hell
are you talking about?

498
00:31:47,634 --> 00:31:49,634
Why? You wanna know why?

499
00:31:50,673 --> 00:31:52,073
Open it!

500
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,140
Frak.

501
00:32:02,118 --> 00:32:03,618
That's right.

502
00:32:03,695 --> 00:32:05,795
- They killed my cat!
- "They"?

503
00:32:06,155 --> 00:32:09,155
"They"! Those debased dregs
of humanity out there!

504
00:32:09,258 --> 00:32:11,758
Yeah, that lost tribe
in search of a new home,

505
00:32:12,069 --> 00:32:14,169
so they can roost
and rot again.

506
00:32:14,296 --> 00:32:16,096
For how long has the cat been dead?

507
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,580
How long?! It's irrelevant,
it's immaterial!

508
00:32:18,724 --> 00:32:20,324
It wasn't even my cat!

509
00:32:20,749 --> 00:32:22,949
Romo.
It's been dead for weeks.

510
00:32:23,201 --> 00:32:25,201
It belonged to my wife.

511
00:32:25,258 --> 00:32:27,258
I just retrieved it
from a vet on Gemini.

512
00:32:27,391 --> 00:32:28,991
When the bombs started to fall,

513
00:32:29,046 --> 00:32:32,346
and fate presented me
with a choice:

514
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:35,010
I could get back
on that shuttle or...

515
00:32:37,009 --> 00:32:40,009
I could run home and...
try to save my family.

516
00:32:43,469 --> 00:32:45,469
- How would you think I chose?
<i>- Romo.</i>

517
00:32:45,556 --> 00:32:48,056
<i>We've all had to make difficult
choices, you don't think I know?</i>

518
00:32:48,556 --> 00:32:50,556
Your wife's name was Faye.

519
00:32:50,659 --> 00:32:53,359
You had two daughters,
Jennifer and Kate!

520
00:32:53,485 --> 00:32:55,485
They were over 200 passengers
on that shuttle,

521
00:32:56,289 --> 00:32:58,289
<i>only a handful chose to stay behind.</i>

522
00:32:59,722 --> 00:33:01,422
Yeah. That's right,
it was in your file

523
00:33:01,547 --> 00:33:03,547
when you headed the job
as Baltar's council.

524
00:33:03,893 --> 00:33:05,893
But no one blamed you, Romo,

525
00:33:06,087 --> 00:33:08,487
because at a certain point,
we all made decisions

526
00:33:08,552 --> 00:33:11,352
that saved our lives
at the cost of others.

527
00:33:12,773 --> 00:33:14,773
You think you're unique, Romo?

528
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:17,079
Think you're sins are so special?

529
00:33:17,225 --> 00:33:19,225
<i>Is that it, counselor?</i>

530
00:33:19,305 --> 00:33:21,905
You're gonna rest your entire
case on that pathetic...

531
00:33:22,595 --> 00:33:24,195
little bit of insight?

532
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,970
No. Unless...

533
00:33:27,556 --> 00:33:30,556
The clean slate. The fresh start.
Maybe they are illusions,

534
00:33:30,691 --> 00:33:32,691
...like you said.

535
00:33:32,974 --> 00:33:36,374
But at a certain point,
faith in ourselves,

536
00:33:37,177 --> 00:33:41,177
<i>in our right to survive as
a species, as a people

537
00:33:41,274 --> 00:33:44,274
that's not a given,
that's a choice.

538
00:33:46,021 --> 00:33:49,321
Well, I've made mine.
And if you can't stomach that,

539
00:33:49,396 --> 00:33:52,196
then you had damn well better
squeeze that trigger right now.

540
00:33:52,345 --> 00:33:53,345
<i>Go on.</i>

541
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:56,333
What are you waiting for?

542
00:33:58,773 --> 00:34:00,773
Or you can make a choice:

543
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:03,470
Put your past behind you,

544
00:34:04,643 --> 00:34:06,143
put the gun down

545
00:34:06,849 --> 00:34:09,849
and help me, because
I'm telling you

546
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,724
I'm gonna make a difference
in this fleet.

547
00:34:13,813 --> 00:34:15,413
Is that your final word?

548
00:34:16,045 --> 00:34:17,545
That's up to you.

549
00:34:19,556 --> 00:34:20,956
Then swear it.

550
00:34:22,438 --> 00:34:25,038
<i>I,
Leland Joseph Adama,</i>

551
00:34:25,611 --> 00:34:28,411
do now avow and affirm...

552
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:32,190
<i>...that I take the office of
president of the 12 Colonies of Kobol</i>

553
00:34:33,152 --> 00:34:36,152
without any moral reservation
or mental evasion.

554
00:34:36,292 --> 00:34:40,492
<i>...that I take the office of
president of the 12 colonies of Kobol</i>

555
00:34:40,594 --> 00:34:43,594
<i>without any moral reservation
or mental evasion.</i>

556
00:34:46,861 --> 00:34:48,561
This is a frakking joke.

557
00:34:50,101 --> 00:34:54,101
You're the only man I can
trust to command this ship.

558
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:56,610
Well, maybe you're crazy enough
to pull a stunt like this,

559
00:34:56,713 --> 00:34:59,713
but you can't be crazy enough
to leave me in charge.

560
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:03,330
In case you forgot, my last term
at the helm was a complete disaster.

561
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,660
That was a long time ago.

562
00:35:05,715 --> 00:35:08,215
You're not the same
man you were.

563
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:12,316
You're not even the same man
that came back from New Caprica.

564
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,200
You've found out a lot
about yourself,

565
00:35:17,272 --> 00:35:19,672
been tested in ways I can
barely begin to imagine.

566
00:35:20,601 --> 00:35:22,101
You're ready.

567
00:35:23,171 --> 00:35:26,671
Besides, don't count on
this being permanent.

568
00:35:28,216 --> 00:35:29,816
What if it is?

569
00:35:32,238 --> 00:35:33,738
Put these on.

570
00:35:34,943 --> 00:35:36,408
Then you lead the people...

571
00:35:37,558 --> 00:35:39,643
to Earth, the best way you can.

572
00:35:39,773 --> 00:35:42,273
<i>The fleet has stayed here
too long already.</i>

573
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,342
Any other last orders?

574
00:35:46,486 --> 00:35:47,486
Just one.

575
00:35:50,634 --> 00:35:52,434
Give Athena back her daughter.

576
00:35:52,532 --> 00:35:55,532
She needs her family.
We all need our family.

577
00:35:57,316 --> 00:35:58,916
Take care of this one.

578
00:36:35,534 --> 00:36:38,334
All right, let me see the changes
before you get this out to the press.

579
00:36:38,395 --> 00:36:40,395
- All right.
- Thank you.

580
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:41,920
Mr. Lampkin.

581
00:36:44,455 --> 00:36:45,455
Romo.

582
00:36:46,651 --> 00:36:49,351
One day in office, and you've
already got a First Pet.

583
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:53,039
But Jake here is a genuine
hero of the resistance.

584
00:36:53,189 --> 00:36:54,589
Why don't you check?

585
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,780
<i>Unfortunately, his previous
owners had to let him go.</i>

586
00:36:58,969 --> 00:37:00,675
Jake, meet Romo.

587
00:37:00,825 --> 00:37:02,569
<i>Romo, meet Jake.</i>

588
00:37:05,169 --> 00:37:06,869
Your new best friend.

589
00:37:07,065 --> 00:37:10,065
There's one thing I hate more
than cats. It's dogs.

590
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,600
See, a new pet for you to loathe.
I knew it would be the perfect gift.

591
00:37:16,262 --> 00:37:17,862
Good luck, Jake.

592
00:37:22,144 --> 00:37:24,644
I hear you're keeping
Zarek as vice president.

593
00:37:24,698 --> 00:37:26,298
I can use the advice.

594
00:37:26,998 --> 00:37:28,998
And as long as he knows
he's heard,

595
00:37:30,048 --> 00:37:31,448
I think I can trust him.

596
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,583
Don't know if I agree
with your thinking, but...

597
00:37:34,647 --> 00:37:36,647
Well, I could say the same
thing about yours.

598
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:41,244
The only difference is,
you are gonna be President,

599
00:37:41,379 --> 00:37:43,379
I'm just getting in a plane.

600
00:37:44,575 --> 00:37:47,275
Waiting alone in a Raptor, while
the rest of the fleet jumps away,

601
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,340
that's not just getting
in a plane.

602
00:37:50,118 --> 00:37:51,618
<i>That...that sounds a lot like--</i>

603
00:37:52,346 --> 00:37:54,346
Well, that sounds a lot
like suicide, Dad.

604
00:37:54,562 --> 00:37:57,262
At least this time I'm
only risking my own neck.

605
00:37:57,391 --> 00:38:00,691
So I guess it won't matter if, as
President, I order you not to do this?

606
00:38:04,429 --> 00:38:07,029
I don't know if I ever
told you this, but...

607
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,843
one of my first missions was
a solo recon,

608
00:38:10,737 --> 00:38:13,737
being alone in a Raptor
in enemy space,

609
00:38:13,818 --> 00:38:16,518
I'm not gonna lie to you
I was scared.

610
00:38:16,578 --> 00:38:19,978
<i>I told myself that I was doing my duty
I'd have time to face my fear.</i>

611
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,540
That's a good memory.

612
00:38:25,667 --> 00:38:27,267
Why are you doing this?

613
00:38:27,421 --> 00:38:29,421
Because I can't live without her.

614
00:38:31,627 --> 00:38:35,727
<i>And Laura is gonna get to rendezvous
point. I have to believe that.</i>

615
00:38:52,321 --> 00:38:54,321
- Admiral.
<i>- Admiral.</i>

616
00:38:56,531 --> 00:38:58,031
What do you hear, Starbuck?

617
00:38:58,124 --> 00:38:59,624
Nothing but the rain, sir.

618
00:38:59,723 --> 00:39:02,523
Grab your gun and
bring the cat in.

619
00:39:02,739 --> 00:39:03,739
Yes, sir.

620
00:39:03,852 --> 00:39:06,252
Keep a light on.
I'll be back.

621
00:39:07,066 --> 00:39:09,066
You can count on it.

622
00:40:07,041 --> 00:40:09,441
<i>Galactica, this is Husker.</i>
I'm in position.

623
00:40:09,499 --> 00:40:11,199
Affirmative, Husker.

624
00:40:14,595 --> 00:40:17,595
All fleet ships.
<i>This is Galactica Actual.</i>

625
00:40:18,454 --> 00:40:20,754
- Commence jump.
- Yes, sir.
