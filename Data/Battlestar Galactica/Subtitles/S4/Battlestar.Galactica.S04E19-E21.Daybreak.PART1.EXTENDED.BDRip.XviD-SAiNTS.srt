1
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:04,128
Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.

2
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:07,382
Hera!

3
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:09,425
Were you with us
a moment ago?

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,094
In the lobby of
the opera house?

5
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:14,430
I don't know. I was there,
too. And so was Hera.

6
00:00:17,393 --> 00:00:19,310
If that's me lying there,
then what am I?

7
00:00:19,395 --> 00:00:21,688
She took these
from her own mortal remains.

8
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:27,110
The blood on these dog tags
is a 100% proof-positive match

9
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,362
for one Kara Thrace.

10
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:32,699
Sam!

11
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:38,329
We tried hooking him up
to the main power grid,

12
00:00:38,414 --> 00:00:40,289
thought it might
reset his neural net.

13
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,083
This has been
happening all over the ship.

14
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,210
Power surges,
temperature fluctuations.

15
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,462
And now you're telling me
it's been him all along?

16
00:00:48,132 --> 00:00:49,173
That for me?

17
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,759
Hera wrote the notes
to a song that

18
00:00:51,844 --> 00:00:54,303
my father used to play
to me when I was a child.

19
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,098
The same song
that led us to Earth.

20
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,642
There's a pattern
that I can't see.

21
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:01,728
But I think
that you can.

22
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,814
So we are going to pick it
apart until we figure it out.

23
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:07,150
That's impossible.
Somebody saw her.

24
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:08,401
What the hell is
going on up there?

25
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,862
Boomer took Hera. Just walked
right out of the daycare.

26
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:17,368
Job well done.
You go get some rest.

27
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:20,246
Don't worry.
We'll take good care of her.

28
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,081
Boomer.
No. Boomer.

29
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:25,626
If Cavil's plan all along was to
steal Hera so he could study her,

30
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:27,170
he'll take her
to the colony.

31
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:30,173
It's where we and the Centurions
went after the first war.

32
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,181
We're abandoning ship, Tigh.

33
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:39,932
Put out the orders.
I want the crew

34
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:41,726
to start
stripping down Galactica.

35
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:44,479
Pack in all
the weapons and gear.

36
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:47,356
Let's start off-loading
civilians by tomorrow.

37
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:51,194
Full crews and ordinances
transferred by the end of the week.

38
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:54,030
To Galactica,
best ship in the fleet.

39
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:55,990
To Galactica.

40
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,872
I've commanded
two Battlestars

41
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:27,707
and three escorts
before that.

42
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,333
Come on, Bill.
Don't be like that.

43
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:31,294
There's nothing to
get all upset about.

44
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,713
Billions of cubits worth of
equipment entrusted to me,

45
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,590
not to mention
thousands of lives.

46
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,800
It's one hour of your life.

47
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,846
Look, sometimes there are things
you just gotta do, all right?

48
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,659
Do you always
drink and drive?

49
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,372
I drink. He drives.

50
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,753
You like having things
done for you, don't you?

51
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:17,757
It certainly beats having
to do them for yourself.

52
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,844
Don't you?

53
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:25,765
No, I prefer not to rely on
others as much as possible.

54
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:29,852
Less chance of
being let down that way.

55
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,903
Well, since you've
allowed yourself

56
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:42,281
to be in my capable
hands for this evening,

57
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:47,286
here's hoping
I won't let you down.

58
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:50,748
I'll drink
to that, Doctor.

59
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:03,302
You can... You can call me
Gaius, actually. If you want.

60
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:09,225
This is crazy, but I've
actually forgotten your name.

61
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:24,865
Hello? Yes, it is.

62
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,368
Hello. How are you?

63
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:31,038
What? What?

64
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,876
Oh, my Gods.
When was this?

65
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,297
Well, listen, just...
I'm so sorry.

66
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:44,260
If you just wait there, and I'll
be around as soon as I can...

67
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:49,140
No, please. You have to wait.
You have to... You can't...

68
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:53,602
You will wait there, or
I'll sue you for abandonment.

69
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,146
Yeah, I will.

70
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,109
Well, I don't know how long
it's going to take. Just wait.

71
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,903
I'm coming.
I'm coming right now.

72
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,447
Give our love to Sidney.

73
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:05,823
I will. Goodbye.

74
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,450
Bye.

75
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,917
That was a great shower.

76
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:20,171
Oh, my Gods.

77
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,924
That was amazing. I'm just
gonna clean up a little bit here.

78
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,010
Okay, Laura,
no cleaning.

79
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,055
Just a little. No,
this is the last bottle,

80
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,181
and you and I
have to share it.

81
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:31,724
You promised me we'd
finish all the champagne.

82
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,643
All right. Oh, boy,
we drank a lot.

83
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,562
Well, they did.
They did.

84
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,147
What about me?

85
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:41,108
No. Pregnant girls
only get gifts.

86
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,777
Just a sip.

87
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,070
A sip?
Just a sip.

88
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,238
All right.
Just one. Little.

89
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:47,281
Little.

90
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,158
Go ahead. Stop!

91
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,160
Enough.

92
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,579
Oh, my gosh.

93
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,122
Oh!

94
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,834
That was lovely,
Laura. Thank you.

95
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:02,588
Well, it's the least I could
do for my little sister.

96
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,300
Hey, I thought I was
your little sister.

97
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:12,681
Okay, you are my
really little sister.

98
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,561
Oh, boy.

99
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:21,732
How about that woman
with Mrs. Anderson?

100
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,902
Why did she bring those?

101
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,362
What was that?

102
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,698
I don't know, but, you
know, there's always one.

103
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:44,380
Frak me. He's early.

104
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:47,341
Just a second!

105
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,263
Coming!

106
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,603
Hi, I'm...
You must be...

107
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:00,688
Lee, yeah.

108
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,189
Yeah. Yeah.

109
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,067
I'm sorry.
I'm Kara. Come on in.

110
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,279
That's very nice.
You didn't have to do that.

111
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:11,115
I'll take those.
Put them in some water.

112
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:12,741
Zak!

113
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:15,828
Nice place.

114
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,497
It's a rattrap,
but the rent's cheap.

115
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,332
No, it's...

116
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,543
It's got real charm.

117
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:25,588
And you're a terrible
liar. We should play cards.

118
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:26,922
I hold my own.

119
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,216
I'm sure you do. Zak!

120
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,761
You just get uglier every
day. Hey, there he is.

121
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,263
How are you?

122
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,266
I see you've met
my better half,

123
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,393
and this one's mine.
Keep your hands off.

124
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,604
And a girlfriend stealer
for a brother. Nice!

125
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,898
Never stole his girlfriend.
Mmm-hmm.

126
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,524
Really bad liar
right here.

127
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:48,152
Yeah, no, we figured that out already.

128
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:50,446
Zak, get the drinks.

129
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,449
Dinner's almost ready.
Yes, sir.

130
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,828
I don't know what to say.
I'm sure it was a mistake.

131
00:08:57,913 --> 00:09:00,664
Nothing in my contract about
being stabbed with a steak knife.

132
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:03,918
She been stealing. She been
stealing while I've been sleeping.

133
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,879
No one is stealing
from you, Dad, all right?

134
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,048
Now you just shut up. You're
in enough trouble already.

135
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,884
I'm out of here. You're
lucky I don't call the cops.

136
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,886
Yes. Yes, we are,
Nurse Barbara.

137
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,181
Thank you. Now, listen,
I'll pay you double, triple.

138
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,682
I thought I asked
you to wait in the car.

139
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,893
This be the new one
you be banging, eh?

140
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:24,480
None of your bloody business. Nurse
Barbara, please. I've got 500 cubits, 1,000.

141
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,982
1,000 frakking cubits
for you to stay the night!

142
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,609
Please! I'll take
all the knives away!

143
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,194
He'll be on
liquid diet forever.

144
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,238
Just spend one
frakking night!

145
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,073
How about you, love?

146
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,367
Bet you charge a lot
more than that, eh?

147
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,953
Shut your filthy mouth.
Stop being so disgusting.

148
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:42,248
This is your father, Gaius.
Not that you'd ever know it.

149
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:44,959
You see, Gaius is ashamed
of his family. I need this.

150
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,211
I need this like a frakking hole
in the head. Even his accent.

151
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:50,756
Stupid bastard actually changed
his accent. Would you believe that?

152
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,676
That is the third
nurse in a row now, Dad.

153
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,678
The third nurse.

154
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,724
Do you have any idea
how much this is costing me?

155
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:04,520
How much it costs, that's
all he cares about now.

156
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:07,898
Not the way he was
brought up, I can tell you.

157
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:09,900
But he don't like
to think about that.

158
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:12,945
No, he don't like to think
about living on a farm

159
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,238
and doing a day's honest,
hard work.

160
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:15,572
All right.
All right. All right.

161
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:18,867
Enough! Enough! Shut up!
Shut up right now!

162
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,577
I won't stand here
one moment longer

163
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:23,664
and listen to your ridiculous
working-class-hero rant.

164
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,625
Look at you! Look at your
shirt that I bought you.

165
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,419
How you dribble and
treat these things.

166
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:30,587
I'll break it
down for you, Dad!

167
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:34,341
You're an obnoxious,
spiteful, cantankerous old git,

168
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:37,136
and you're frakking lucky you're
not living on the frakking street!

169
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,888
Big man cursing his father.

170
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,974
Makes you feel
important, don't it?

171
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:47,646
Gaius, maybe we should... Maybe
you should've stayed in the car,

172
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,982
which is what I
asked you to do.

173
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:53,235
I'm afraid that I'm going to
have to ask you to leave now.

174
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,530
I'm sure that the driver
can see you to your home.

175
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:00,909
I'm gonna spend the rest of
this lovely evening with my dad.

176
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:03,120
Good night.

177
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:29,938
Good morning.

178
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,982
I'm Officer Stephanie
and this is Officer Shawn

179
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:33,692
with the
Caprica City Police.

180
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:35,611
Are you Laura Roslin?

181
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:38,906
Yes, I am.

182
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,282
We need to
speak with you.

183
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,910
May we come inside?
Yes, please do.

184
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,601
We're so sorry.
We have to inform you

185
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,561
there's been
a terrible accident.

186
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:13,482
Late last night, your sisters
and your father were all killed.

187
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:17,027
We weren't able to
verify the identity

188
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:18,904
of the bodies
until a few hours ago.

189
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:23,242
The driver of the other
vehicle is in stable condition,

190
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:27,871
and preliminary tests
indicate he was intoxicated

191
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:32,167
when he sideswiped the car with
your father and your sisters.

192
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,547
Thank you. Please
show yourselves out.

193
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:38,674
We're sorry
for your loss.

194
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:07,429
I don't know. I don't
know what she's doing.

195
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,492
I think she wants us
to cut the pain medication.

196
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:13,287
I don't think she
knows what she wants.

197
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,625
Doctor...

198
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:25,507
Okay, go ahead
and shut it off.

199
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,728
There's only so much of
Galactica to go around.

200
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:39,521
You'd think we were
retiring 10 Battlestars.

201
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,648
Excuse me, Mr. President,
sir. One second.

202
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:44,818
Tell the captains they
are padding their requests.

203
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,778
Send it back. Sir, if you have a minute.

204
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:48,447
Just one second.

205
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,325
Yes, Specialist,
what is it?

206
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:53,452
I know this is not
your problem, sir,

207
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:56,830
but they want us to tear the mag
cellerators from the launch tubes.

208
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,625
Well, the civilian ships
can use them as auto-loaders.

209
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,669
Sir, it's like we're tearing
the old girl's heart out.

210
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:05,505
A Battlestar's whole purpose
is to launch Vipers.

211
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:09,217
I kind of know how you feel.
Part of my heart's here, too.

212
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:13,597
Tell you what,
make the cellerators

213
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,724
the last thing
your men take out.

214
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:20,020
Then turn out the lights and
let the old girl die in peace.

215
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,064
Yes, sir.

216
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:11,780
Well, after the blast, everyone
else's numbers are down,

217
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,365
which gives us
solid majority

218
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:16,118
on over half the civilian
ships in the fleet.

219
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,536
I mean, no one else comes even close

220
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,955
to having that kind
of political power.

221
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,998
Our time is here, Gaius.

222
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:27,087
She's right, Gaius. The
end times are approaching.

223
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:30,549
Humanity's final chapter
is about to be written,

224
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:33,593
and you...
You will be its author.

225
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:38,140
Gaius, did you hear me?
This is it.

226
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,018
This is it, Gaius.

227
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:55,824
There's never enough,
you know.

228
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,787
Never enough money,
fame...

229
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,000
Women.

230
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:11,798
The more you want, the more
you need, the more you want.

231
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:14,009
There's always
a hunger for

232
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:17,387
more money,
greater fame...

233
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,433
Different women.

234
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:25,145
Oh, yeah?
It's a tragedy, your life.

235
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,647
The point I'm trying to make, Calvin,

236
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:29,733
the point
you're missing,

237
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:33,195
is that there's
a certain futility

238
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:35,655
in centering
one's entire life

239
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,116
around trying to
satisfy appetites

240
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:40,577
that can truly
never be sated.

241
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:50,003
So, if you could
do your life over,

242
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,422
what would you change?

243
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:43,849
Sorry, sir.

244
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,142
As I was saying,

245
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:49,813
the old man intends to fly the
last Viper off ship himself.

246
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,107
Tell the deck gang to leave
one launch tube intact,

247
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,860
set to remote pilot launch. Yes, sir.

248
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,950
You'll never make
admiral like that.

249
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:47,329
Eat it.

250
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:51,750
You haven't
eaten in days.

251
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:53,668
You have to
eat it now, all.

252
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:54,794
No!

253
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,303
You're in big trouble.

254
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:17,734
So, you wonder how
to prevent gimbal lock

255
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:22,113
in a turn, lateral turn,
of greater than 6 G's.

256
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,115
It's quite easy, actually.
You just weld

257
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,118
this baby at the
T- joint at the medial axis...

258
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,334
Lieutenant...

259
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,462
Wait, wait, wait...

260
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:41,549
We can get in
a lot of trouble.

261
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,551
Do you know
what you're doing?

262
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:46,096
Yes.

263
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,516
As long as you know!

264
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,771
They're all
the same, Karl.

265
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,732
No, they're different.

266
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:00,902
You know they're different.

267
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:04,072
How you felt about Boomer,
that was different.

268
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,741
That's why you
did what you did.

269
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:10,620
I did what I did because
I'm a frakking idiot.

270
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,749
A 2,000-year-old idiot who
cannot learn the simplest lesson.

271
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:17,085
Machines are not people.

272
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,295
They're just machines.

273
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,965
My wife, Athena,

274
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:26,970
is a person. She's a blow-up
doll, Karl. They all are.

275
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:31,057
Athena, Sharon, Boomer. Call them
what you will. They're all the same.

276
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:34,561
They're all the same,
because we made them the same.

277
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:41,443
Don't blame yourself,
but you can't trust them.

278
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,361
You can't trust any of them.

279
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:58,626
Frak. You didn't hear that,
all right? Let me help you.

280
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:06,968
These are...

281
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,094
Pilots from
the memorial wall.

282
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:09,846
We wanted to take
them with us, you know,

283
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,598
so we wouldn't leave them
behind with the others.

284
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,641
The others? Lot of
photos still down there.

285
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,894
Nobody knows who
they are anymore.

286
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:19,481
Probably friends and relatives
of people on Galactica

287
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,983
who died somewhere
along the way.

288
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:25,028
Admiral?

289
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:26,237
As you were.

290
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,200
Bear it in mind?

291
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:55,785
Well, when will
you bear it in mind?

292
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:57,787
You haven't even
listened to my proposal.

293
00:24:57,872 --> 00:25:00,248
I'm not even saying
it'll necessarily be me.

294
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,792
My people deserve a
voice in the government.

295
00:25:02,877 --> 00:25:04,502
Now, I'm literally
talking about the lives

296
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:07,130
and well-being of thousands
of people in the fleet.

297
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,214
Is that what you
were thinking about

298
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:09,924
when you outted
Starbuck's secret?

299
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:12,302
The well-being of
thousands of people?

300
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:15,388
Or the political gain
of Gaius Baltar, again?

301
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:19,225
Is that what this is about?

302
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,562
Does everything
have to be reduced to

303
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:25,523
your personal feelings
about Kara Thrace?

304
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:27,567
Listen to me, Mr. Adama.

305
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:30,528
Lee.

306
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,824
I'm asking to have
a genuine conversation.

307
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:36,868
Please.

308
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,959
Five minutes.

309
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,504
I'll be back
in five minutes.

310
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:49,714
Five minutes inside.

311
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:54,218
And you think there's some kind
of meaning in these musical notes?

312
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:58,598
I don't know.
I'm just groping, mostly,

313
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,642
looking for patterns, trying
to see what comes to me.

314
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:04,062
I thought that if I assigned
numbers to the notes...

315
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,024
I don't know.

316
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:22,580
What Baltar said the
other day, is it the truth?

317
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:28,628
Yeah.

318
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:36,094
I found my body,
and I burned it on Earth.

319
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,515
I don't know what I am.

320
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,192
I have to ask him a question.

321
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,902
Do you know how
to plug him in?

322
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:56,614
Yeah.

323
00:26:58,158 --> 00:26:59,242
Hey.

324
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,620
I know what you are.

325
00:27:03,831 --> 00:27:05,581
You're my daughter.

326
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,209
Don't forget it.

327
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:27,311
You're on pace to land in
the hall of fame someday,

328
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:29,522
but you still haven't
won a championship,

329
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,983
and now the C-Bucks
are in a rebuilding year.

330
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:35,695
If you don't get to hoist
the cup before you retire,

331
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:38,823
will you consider your
career to be incomplete?

332
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,911
Well, right now, I'm just
focused on getting stronger

333
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:46,873
and helping out the
team any way I can.

334
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:48,166
Um...

335
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,586
I...

336
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:53,087
Yeah.

337
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:55,506
Hmm.

338
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:00,511
Look, you want to
know the truth?

339
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:06,893
I don't really care
about the stats or the cup

340
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:09,729
or the trophy,
or anything like that.

341
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:13,441
In fact, even the games aren't
that important to me, not really.

342
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:19,238
What matters to me
is the perfect throw, okay?

343
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:23,701
Making the perfect catch,
the perfect step and block,

344
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:27,997
it's perfection.
That's what it's about.

345
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:32,502
It's about those
moments when you...

346
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:38,049
When you can feel
the perfection of creation,

347
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:46,224
the beauty of physics, the wonder
of mathematics. You know, the elation

348
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:49,393
of action and reaction,

349
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:50,895
and that is
the kind of perfection

350
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,313
that I want to
be connected to.

351
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:55,691
Spins and turns.
Angles and curves.

352
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:58,069
The shape of
dreams half-remembered.

353
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:01,114
Slip the surly bonds of earth
and touch the face of perfection.

354
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:03,407
A perfect face.
Perfect lace.

355
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:07,036
Find a perfect world for the
end of Kara Thrace. End of line.

356
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:09,664
He says a lot of things.

357
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,792
Go ahead.
Ask your question.

358
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:16,504
You ask him.

359
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,185
Let's forget for one moment that
you're the son of the admiral...

360
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,687
Shut the frak up.

361
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,023
Get to the frakking point.
You got five minutes. Speak.

362
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,735
Galactica has been
more than our guardian.

363
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,196
She's literally a vessel
into which we have poured

364
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,448
all of our hopes and dreams,

365
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:49,245
and when she's gone, when we
can no longer derive the security

366
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:52,707
from looking out a window and
seeing her massive bulk gliding by,

367
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,959
then this life will be over

368
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,795
and a new life
will have begun,

369
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:01,757
a new life that requires
a new way of thinking.

370
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:05,720
Now, I am willing
to do anything,

371
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:10,641
anything I can to make
this new life a good one.

372
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:13,895
All I am asking
is that my people

373
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:16,814
have a voice in
the government.

374
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,567
I represent
thousands of people.

375
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,569
They deserve to
be enfranchised

376
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,154
just as much as anyone else.

377
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,739
I'm not talking about myself.

378
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,033
This is not
for me personally.

379
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:30,620
Come on, Lee.
It makes sense.

380
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:35,666
You know it's
the right thing to do.

381
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,046
What I know

382
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:44,508
is that in all the years that I've
known you, I've never seen you make

383
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:45,760
one truly selfless act.

384
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:46,886
Right.

385
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,721
Never seen you do something

386
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,932
that didn't, on some level,
serve the greater needs

387
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:52,183
of Gaius frakking Baltar.

388
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,518
So, no, I won't
take your hand.

389
00:30:55,229 --> 00:30:58,731
And I won't bring you
or any representative

390
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,566
from your movement
into the government.

391
00:31:00,651 --> 00:31:04,278
Right. So, that's
what it boils down to.

392
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:07,156
My people can't
get representation

393
00:31:07,241 --> 00:31:09,742
because I personally
haven't passed

394
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,911
Lee Adama's
selfless altruism test.

395
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:13,621
I haven't been a goody-goody
and worn a badge of honor.

396
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:16,832
I don't think you've
passed Gaius Baltar's test.

397
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,502
Go ahead, look me in the eye
and tell me about the time

398
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:22,171
that you made a truly
heroic act of conscience

399
00:31:22,256 --> 00:31:24,924
which helped you not
even in the slightest.

400
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:27,301
Tell me!
I'll even believe you.

401
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,182
You're right.

402
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:37,228
I wouldn't trust me, either.

403
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:52,535
Holy frak.

404
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:03,504
I dare you.
I double-dog dare you.

405
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:21,939
Get out of here!
Come on! Come on.

406
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:24,942
Come on.

407
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:26,986
Come on!

408
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,283
Attaboy. Attaboy!

409
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:35,536
Frak.

410
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:43,669
Stupid frakking bird.

411
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:25,586
Can I have your
attention, please?

412
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,011
I'm sure you're all aware

413
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:37,306
that a child was abducted
from this ship recently.

414
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:40,643
I thought that a rescue
mission was impractical.

415
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,772
Well, I was wrong.

416
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,690
He didn't say where
he got the information,

417
00:33:46,817 --> 00:33:50,152
but Starbuck was there,
so I bet he talked to Anders.

418
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,696
Yeah. I know.
Pretty freaky.

419
00:33:53,115 --> 00:33:54,532
He thought that
a rescue mission

420
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:55,950
was impractical
because he didn't know

421
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:59,120
where she was being held. But
that's changed now, I guess,

422
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:02,123
because he does know
where she's being held.

423
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:05,751
Of course, knowing where the colony
is is not nearly the same thing

424
00:34:05,836 --> 00:34:08,421
as being able to
actually get her out.

425
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,965
This is insane.
You know that, right?

426
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,758
What I know is that
Hera has some meaning

427
00:34:12,843 --> 00:34:14,510
that transcends
the here and now.

428
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:17,138
She is meant to fulfill
a role, just as we were.

429
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:19,515
So we're going,
the five of us.

430
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:22,309
Oh, you're making decisions
for all of us now.

431
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:23,394
You'll go, Tory.

432
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,062
Truth is,
you never could be alone.

433
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:30,025
Yeah, the mission is to
be strictly volunteer only.

434
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:32,820
Any man or woman
over the age of 15.

435
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:37,408
And the Admiral also wants any
former colonial officer or crewman

436
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:40,119
incarcerated after
the recent mutiny.

437
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:42,997
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

438
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,251
Everyone has to
make their own choice,

439
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,462
and they have to
do it in person.

440
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:52,089
The old man is
waiting on the hangar deck.

441
00:34:52,174 --> 00:34:54,675
Set in-port watch
until you get back.

442
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,678
Watch-keepers report
to the admiral's quarters

443
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,097
to declare
yourselves in person.

444
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:02,349
Move.

445
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:04,852
You know what
you're gonna do?

446
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,020
Not exactly.

447
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,938
Well, take your time.

448
00:35:08,482 --> 00:35:11,775
It takes approximately four
minutes to get down there.

449
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:14,778
It's really happening.

450
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:17,740
We're going after her.

451
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,326
Or what's left of her.

452
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,953
Cavil's probably had
her sliced and diced

453
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:24,622
and cut up into
1,000 specimens...

454
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:28,542
Stop it. Just stop it, okay?

455
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:32,379
She's still alive, and she's still
out there, and we're gonna get her,

456
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:35,007
and everything's
gonna be all right.

457
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:37,510
It's not gonna be
all right, Karl.

458
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,972
No. You're wrong.

459
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,142
You're wrong.

460
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:55,236
Dots. Lots and
lots and lots of dots.

461
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,738
She's clearly very gifted.

462
00:35:57,906 --> 00:35:59,240
She hasn't
eaten in days.

463
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:01,784
I think we should begin
intravenous nutritional supplements

464
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:04,245
to build up her strength
before we begin testing.

465
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:05,788
She wants her mother.

466
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:08,791
Well, she can't have
her mother, now, can she?

467
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:12,127
I'm sorry. I forgot to
sound all soppy and soft

468
00:36:12,254 --> 00:36:16,173
when speaking of the child. She
is a child, a frightened one.

469
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:19,635
She's a half-human,
half-machine object of curiosity

470
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,679
that holds the key
to our continued existence

471
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:24,014
somewhere in
her genetic code.

472
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:27,601
So let's get a tube in
her and get her ready.

473
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:47,037
Just don't get us bounced
out of here, all right?

474
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:48,872
Galactica's the end of
the line for pilot teams.

475
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:51,375
We get kicked out of here, we're
boots on the ground from now on.

476
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,460
I know.
I know it's crazy.

477
00:36:56,298 --> 00:36:57,840
I should stop.

478
00:36:58,258 --> 00:37:00,801
I should stop, yes.
I will, I will.

479
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,470
But you can't stop, right?

480
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:06,390
Right. I just feel so
alive when I'm with him!

481
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:09,435
Like the way you're supposed to
always feel but you just never do.

482
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:11,770
Yeah, I know
what that's like.

483
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:31,540
I know it's been three
months. I know that.

484
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,335
I do too go out. I do.

485
00:37:36,338 --> 00:37:37,421
I do.

486
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:39,631
Uh-uh.

487
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:41,175
No.

488
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:42,634
Uh-uh.

489
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:46,930
No, I'm not joining
Adar's presidential campaign.

490
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:48,515
I don't care.

491
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:51,894
Because I don't like
politics to begin with,

492
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:54,855
and a national campaign
is just so blah.

493
00:37:56,149 --> 00:37:57,608
Oh, Gods.
You are relentless.

494
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:04,323
Okay, okay.
I'll make a deal.

495
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:09,745
I'll go on the date if you'll stop
bugging me about this campaign.

496
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:16,335
How young is he?

497
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:22,257
I know. Okay. I made a deal.

498
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,677
What's Mr. Perfect's name?

499
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:28,847
Sean. I like that name. Sean what?

500
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:33,727
Sean Ellison?
Sounds familiar.

501
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:36,772
Okay. All right. Bye.

502
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:08,345
No one should feel obligated
to join this mission in any way!

503
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:16,395
This is a decision
I have made for myself.

504
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:22,734
If it turns out that there
are not enough personnel

505
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,736
to crew Galactica,

506
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:34,621
I will lead a Raptor assault with
anyone who is willing to join me.

507
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:40,502
Let there be no illusions!

508
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:44,840
This is likely to
be a one-way trip.

509
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:49,595
So don't volunteer out
of sentiment or emotion.

510
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,270
There is a line
running down this deck.

511
00:40:05,487 --> 00:40:09,239
Volunteers,
move to the starboard side!

512
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:12,743
Everyone else to the port.

513
00:40:47,529 --> 00:40:49,154
Make your choice.

514
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:10,551
Doc.

515
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,847
The Fleet can't afford
to lose a doctor.

516
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:18,767
Go on back, Sherman,
and thank you.

517
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:36,785
Like you got
something better to do.

518
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:11,570
Excuse me. Thank you.

519
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:28,754
You didn't think you were gonna take
off without me, Admiral, did you?

520
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:32,633
It never crossed my mind,
Madam President.

521
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:04,122
Jump complete. Frak!

522
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:07,959
Plot us a way the
hell back out of here.

523
00:43:08,044 --> 00:43:09,044
Right. You got it.

524
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:11,088
Figures that a brain-damaged
Cylon would send us hunting

525
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:12,881
in the middle of
an asteroid field.

526
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:15,133
The more things change,
the more they stay the same.

527
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:16,843
You got a recon mission
where someone needs

528
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:18,178
to hang their ass
over the edge

529
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,389
and wait for a bite,
send Racetrack and Skulls.

530
00:43:20,473 --> 00:43:22,641
Well, beats sitting
in a cell.

531
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:24,726
Long-range dradis
just picked something up.

532
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:27,521
Holy frak, we're right
on top of a singularity.

533
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,690
A black hole? Where away?

534
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:34,236
7-3-8 carom 8-8-2. We're
already sliding toward it.

535
00:43:40,493 --> 00:43:42,619
Spin up the FTL.
We're getting out of here.

536
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:46,373
Frak me.

537
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:47,457
What?

538
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:49,042
You're not
gonna believe this.

539
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:52,921
Based on the
coordinates we got from Sam,

540
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:55,799
we have determined that the
Cylon colony is located here.

541
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:58,593
It's within our jump range,
but there's a sizable catch.

542
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:01,930
It's located within an accretion
disk of a naked singularity.

543
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:03,932
It's a strategically-sound
position.

544
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:07,102
The colony's bound within the
gravity well of the black hole,

545
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:08,770
but maintains a stable orbit.

546
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:10,897
How do we get in there?
Look at all the crap

547
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:12,107
floating around
in that current.

548
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:13,859
There is no way
to navigate that current.

549
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:15,527
The tidal stresses
are too strong.

550
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:17,821
It would rip the ship apart
before we got within 10 SU.

551
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,364
But there is one
safe jump spot.

552
00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:20,782
It's where they bring
their baseships in and out.

553
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:23,076
We got lucky. Two
baseships jumped in and out

554
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:24,995
while the Raptor
was taking pictures.

555
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:28,165
This right here is
our only parking spot.

556
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:30,333
That's right on top
of the frakking thing.

557
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:32,169
Less than one click,
by our estimates.

558
00:44:32,253 --> 00:44:33,503
One click?

559
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:34,796
Point-blank range.

560
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:38,383
And you can bet that they will
have every gun in that colony

561
00:44:38,468 --> 00:44:40,302
pointed at that
parking spot of yours.

562
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:42,179
That's what I'd do.

563
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:44,181
Leave only one
way in and out,

564
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:47,267
then make it impossible
to get past the gates.

565
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,397
All right.

566
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:00,739
Let's get to work.

567
00:45:20,802 --> 00:45:24,095
40? I've never paid
more than 30 on Picon.

568
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:26,306
This ain't Picon.

569
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,391
All right,
you got me there.

570
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:30,811
This ain't Picon.
All right, 40.

571
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:33,230
Show him a good time.

572
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:35,732
I don't want
a lap dance, okay?

573
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,068
Try it!
You'll like it.

574
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:42,155
Keep the 40, he deserves it. Thank you.

575
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,743
So, are you gonna
take the job or not?

576
00:45:46,828 --> 00:45:48,870
Maybe I should
just do it.

577
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:51,081
Letting my pride
get in the way.

578
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:52,999
Now you're talking.

579
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:55,961
I mean, who cares? It's
one hour of your time,

580
00:45:56,045 --> 00:45:58,547
and then you have
a whole new life,

581
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:05,428
a life without midnight watches
or drills or Fleet politics

582
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:08,265
or the inspections
or any of that crap.

583
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:14,020
Life! You could be
here every night.

584
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:16,106
He won't be
here every night.

585
00:46:16,232 --> 00:46:18,024
Can hardly
get him here once.

586
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:21,611
To retirement?

587
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:24,531
What do you say?

588
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:29,786
To retirement.

589
00:46:29,871 --> 00:46:31,580
Yeah!
Yes!

590
00:46:47,597 --> 00:46:49,222
You're fired up.

591
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:51,558
You ain't seen nothing yet.

592
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:54,686
Help me up, boys.
Help me up.

593
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,445
Yeah!

594
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:08,825
Look at that.

595
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:14,080
She's the finest kind,
my Ellen, the finest kind.

596
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,463
If you don't participate in
the political conversation,

597
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:22,672
then you are
giving up your voice.

598
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:24,466
You're giving up
your right to have a say

599
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:27,344
in the way that
our society is run.

600
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:29,596
What?

601
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,431
You've really bought into
all that crap, haven't you?

602
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,225
I do, proudly.

603
00:47:34,435 --> 00:47:36,353
And so have you, by
the way. Yeah. Really?

604
00:47:36,437 --> 00:47:39,648
'Cause that's what the uniform stands
for. It's what we train to defend.

605
00:47:39,732 --> 00:47:41,316
Oh, you didn't.
It's true.

606
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:43,818
No, no, no, no. That's
sad. That's sad. Yes!

607
00:47:43,903 --> 00:47:44,903
It's cute,
but it's sad.

608
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:46,863
Let me guess,
he's going on about voting

609
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:49,324
and its importance to a
democratic way of life again.

610
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:50,742
So, you were listening.

611
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:53,745
You didn't tell me that your
brother's an idealistic dreamer.

612
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:57,248
Dreamer? The sad truth is, he's not.

613
00:47:57,667 --> 00:47:59,542
Beneath that
romantic exterior

614
00:47:59,669 --> 00:48:01,544
lies the heart
of a true cynic.

615
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:04,339
Really? This is going to be
fascinating. Things are looking up.

616
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:07,217
Yeah, it's one of the
many, many, many reasons

617
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:10,095
that him and Dad aren't on
speaking terms anymore.

618
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:12,722
Oh, come on. Family angst
and drama. I love it.

619
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:15,350
Come on, boys, let's
open up some old wounds.

620
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:17,936
No, let's not. Dad
believes in the system,

621
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,897
believes in the uniform, believes
in something greater than himself.

622
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:23,024
Correction.
Dad believes in himself,

623
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:25,360
his uniform, his
system, his way of life,

624
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:27,862
and if you're not with him
in that tiny little bubble,

625
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:29,197
then you might
as well not exist.

626
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:32,992
If you hate him so much, why'd
you follow in his footsteps?

627
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:35,245
Touché.

628
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,502
Service gave me
four years of college.

629
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,796
I gave the service
four years in return.

630
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,215
Simple as that.
See? A cynic.

631
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:50,927
Right through to that big empty
space that used to hold his heart.

632
00:48:52,221 --> 00:48:55,390
Honey, I think I'm starting
to like your brother.

633
00:48:57,977 --> 00:48:59,602
You must be Sean.

634
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:01,563
Yeah, I must be.

635
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:03,398
I hope so.

636
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,402
I'll take these. They're beautiful.
Thank you. You're welcome.

637
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:10,071
Do you like white wine? I do.

638
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,742
Kind of awkward, huh?

639
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:15,368
Blind date and all?

640
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:16,828
No, it's not, really.

641
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:21,708
It's just that I have this
feeling that I know you.

642
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:23,209
Oh?
Mmm-hmm.

643
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:24,502
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

644
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:28,131
There you go, Sean.

645
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:30,383
Thank you.
Welcome.

646
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:39,225
So, wait a minute.

647
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:46,107
You were
one of my students.

648
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:51,362
Yeah, guilty as charged.

649
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:55,533
I mean, as soon as Marcy
mentioned your name I knew,

650
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:58,578
but I didn't
want to tell her.

651
00:49:58,913 --> 00:50:00,580
And you knew I was old
enough to be your...

652
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,165
Teacher? Yeah.

653
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:06,419
But I graduated
some time ago.

654
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:17,639
Should I go?
Did I say you should go?

655
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:21,017
I didn't say
you should go.

656
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,445
The night's young. Apparently, so
are you. Let's see what happens.

657
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:38,117
Sean.

658
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:45,208
Thank you.

659
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,710
You wouldn't do it.

660
00:50:48,838 --> 00:50:51,840
For that kind of money?
Gods damn right I would.

661
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:53,800
No, you wouldn't.

662
00:50:55,261 --> 00:50:58,346
Look me in the eye and
tell me that you'd do it,

663
00:50:58,806 --> 00:51:02,350
that you'd do it for
a civilian desk job.

664
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:06,938
I want to hear it come
out of your mouth. Say it!

665
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,989
I frakking knew it.

666
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:23,329
Yeah!

667
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:29,586
Come on, soldier.

668
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:31,546
I love you guys.
Yeah.

669
00:51:31,881 --> 00:51:33,798
You guys are my family.

670
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:39,512
Oh, my Gods. Oh, my Gods. Come on.

671
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:42,515
I love you, brother.
Come on, big boy.

672
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:44,809
Legs.
All right. In you go.

673
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:49,355
You want out? Yes. Please. Thank you.

674
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:53,902
Well, he never
could hold his liquor.

675
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,112
Unlike his brother.

676
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:58,698
Hey, I'm still standing.

677
00:51:59,909 --> 00:52:03,411
Which means
it's time for shots.

678
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:14,172
Yes!

679
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:19,761
Where is Bill?

680
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:21,971
He took a walk.

681
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,391
Look at
all my rent money.

682
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:28,603
I will never
have to work again.

683
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:34,484
Tell me again you're
really quitting this time.

684
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:37,153
Well, that depends
on the old man.

685
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:39,822
But you're older
than him, you know.

686
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:42,784
Saul!

687
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:45,787
When are you gonna
strap on your own pair

688
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:49,540
and stop following him around
like some lovesick kid?

689
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:52,919
You always have to go one
step too far, don't you, Ellen?

690
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:56,172
It's the truth, Saul!
You wanna know something?

691
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:59,509
That man has ten
times more integrity

692
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:02,011
and guts than
anyone I've ever met.

693
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:04,347
And if that is
not worth following,

694
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:06,432
then I don't know
what the frak is.

695
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:08,768
Fine. Go ahead
with your real lover.

696
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,438
You'll come back to me,
Saul, you always do.

697
00:54:14,543 --> 00:54:17,462
There's no need to
torture yourself, Gaius.

698
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:20,840
Just trust in
God's plan for you.

699
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:27,346
What is God's plan for me?

700
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,684
Well, you're
following it right now.

701
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:33,311
Am I?

702
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:37,190
By taking charge of
mankind's remnants

703
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:39,734
and guiding them
to their end.

704
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:45,698
End of what?

705
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:47,158
Gaius.

706
00:54:48,577 --> 00:54:50,578
We're ready to go.
Five seconds, Paulla.

707
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:52,330
Okay.
I'm just...

708
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,733
I'm already taken
care of, actually.

709
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:22,985
I didn't say
it was for you.

710
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:29,742
A woman of many talents.

711
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:32,745
With a whole bag of tricks.

712
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:35,998
Right.

713
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:40,128
Are you thirsty before...

714
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:48,469
What the hell
are you doing here?

715
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:57,019
No, I'm sorry,
what exactly is...

716
00:55:57,396 --> 00:55:59,105
What exactly is...

717
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:02,358
How did you get in here?

718
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,026
Your friend
let me in.

719
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:07,530
Yeah, I see you've poured some
ambrosia, thank you, Calvin.

720
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:10,908
Should I go? What you
should do is go upstairs,

721
00:56:10,993 --> 00:56:14,996
turn left, hit the
bedroom and get ready.

722
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:25,298
Round the mountain
we shall go

723
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:29,635
We shall go, we shall go

724
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:37,310
I think you ought to run along
home now, Calvin, don't you?

725
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,273
You are in big frakking
trouble, you better believe me.

726
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:44,650
You don't think I'm gonna
tell your mom about this?

727
00:56:45,861 --> 00:56:47,945
Total abuse
of my respect.

728
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:50,573
It's very touching.

729
00:56:50,991 --> 00:56:53,075
Befriending
the neighbor's geek son.

730
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:01,125
You're intruding
in my home.

731
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:03,419
He worships you,
you know that?

732
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:06,297
Look, I think it would be
a good idea if you left

733
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:08,716
before I inform
the authorities.

734
00:57:13,597 --> 00:57:15,223
Fine, fine. If that's the
way you want to play it,

735
00:57:15,307 --> 00:57:18,517
then you see, I'm ringing
the police. I'm dialing.

736
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:20,019
Hello,
police department, please.

737
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:21,646
I found your father
a new place to live.

738
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:23,481
Yeah, I'd like to...

739
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:28,319
What?

740
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:31,322
The Regency.
Down by the wharf.

741
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,616
Very tony address.

742
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:36,994
Full-time care, social
activities, medical staff.

743
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:39,080
And the best part,

744
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:42,625
they encourage residents to
garden and grow their own food.

745
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:44,961
Julius will be
a farmer again.

746
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:53,594
His things are being moved
this very moment by the staff.

747
00:57:54,388 --> 00:57:56,264
They'll be set up
in his new room

748
00:57:56,348 --> 00:57:58,140
exactly how he had
them in the apartment.

749
00:57:58,225 --> 00:57:59,600
He loves it.

750
00:58:05,274 --> 00:58:06,399
Loves?

751
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:10,069
Once I showed him
around the facility.

752
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:13,864
Your father's a very
complicated man, Gaius,

753
00:58:13,949 --> 00:58:17,910
but there's a few simple
things that make him very happy.

754
00:58:30,299 --> 00:58:32,258
The last time I saw him,

755
00:58:32,843 --> 00:58:34,468
he seemed happy.

756
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:44,687
I'm leaving Ishay enough for
two more rounds of injections.

757
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:48,232
That should keep you on your
feet for another 48 hours.

758
00:58:48,317 --> 00:58:51,986
Two days. Okay.
That should be enough.

759
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:57,158
You're using up the last little bit of
life you got. You realize that, don't you?

760
00:58:57,242 --> 00:59:00,953
Yes. You've made that
clear to me several times.

761
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:02,413
Mmm.

762
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,665
Right. That's it.
You're done.

763
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:05,875
Thank you. Thank you.

764
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:08,127
Enough.

765
00:59:10,005 --> 00:59:11,672
Thank you, Doctor.

766
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,716
I'm just doing my job.

767
00:59:17,304 --> 00:59:18,346
No.

768
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:26,729
You've done much more than that. You've
taken a patient who should've died

769
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:30,316
years ago, and you've
given her a chance,

770
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:35,071
despite cancer and the Cylons
and her own obstinate nature.

771
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:40,659
And you've given me the
little time I have left,

772
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:43,996
and for
that, you have my...

773
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:50,878
My heartfelt gratitude

774
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:52,463
and my thanks.

775
00:59:56,093 --> 00:59:59,136
Well, I don't know
what to say.

776
00:59:59,221 --> 01:00:00,429
No, no, don't, don't.

777
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:06,394
Don't spoil your image. Just light
a cigarette and go and grumble.

778
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:15,444
She's your patient
now, Ishay.

779
01:00:19,908 --> 01:00:23,452
Ishay, I can barely
see straight.

780
01:00:23,537 --> 01:00:24,745
I'm not surprised.

781
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:28,582
You're so pumped full of drugs
you could float off this bed.

782
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,793
Okay. Two days?

783
01:00:33,088 --> 01:00:34,713
All right, two days.

784
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:37,883
The plan's just starting to take
shape, but one thing's clear.

785
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:40,678
Raptors get the toughest job, as usual.

786
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:45,182
This will require some special
piloting skills, and I mean special,

787
01:00:45,851 --> 01:00:49,562
threading a needle while you're
on a rollercoaster special.

788
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:51,605
While it seems a little
redundant at this point,

789
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:55,443
the word's come down that it's
a volunteer assignment, so...

790
01:00:57,195 --> 01:00:59,321
That's my Raptor
wranglers.

791
01:00:59,573 --> 01:01:03,200
Always looking for new and
interesting ways to get killed.

792
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:08,873
I'm not going to lie to you boys.
We are thin on intel on this one.

793
01:01:08,957 --> 01:01:11,834
The Cylons believe that the most logical
place for Cavil to have taken the girl

794
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:14,962
is deep into the
interior of the colony.

795
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:18,591
Best guess. Right here.

796
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:22,094
We'll be in too close for nukes.
Same thing goes for missiles.

797
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:23,846
No, this is going to be
strictly a gun battle.

798
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:28,184
Like two old ships on the line,
slugging it out at point-blank range.

799
01:01:29,561 --> 01:01:33,814
I want the gun captains to do their
job and start firing immediately

800
01:01:34,316 --> 01:01:36,775
and to continue to fire
until they run out of ammo.

801
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:41,030
Then, I want them to
start throwing rocks.

802
01:01:43,283 --> 01:01:46,619
They're gonna have every gun trained
directly on us as soon as we jump in.

803
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:48,037
If we have any
shot at this,

804
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:50,456
we're gonna have to interrupt
their fire control systems.

805
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,083
And just how the hell is Sam
supposed to help with that?

806
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:57,296
If we can plug him into Galactica's
dradis, FTL and C3 systems,

807
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:01,175
his mind should then be able to directly
communicate with the colony's Hybrids

808
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:02,635
once we jump in.

809
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:05,596
Theoretically, his mind should still
be able to control their commands

810
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,098
and slow down
their response time.

811
01:02:10,519 --> 01:02:11,602
Okay.

812
01:02:13,522 --> 01:02:15,064
Let's do it,
I guess.

813
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:16,232
There's a catch.

814
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:18,817
Routing hardware connections from
all those systems all over the ship

815
01:02:19,486 --> 01:02:21,237
into this room is
gonna take weeks.

816
01:02:21,321 --> 01:02:24,406
It's a lot easier, faster if we
just move him to the existing lines.

817
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:25,741
Okay, where's that?

818
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:28,160
Well, the best place
is the CIC.

819
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:30,204
You're out of
your frakking minds.

820
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:32,748
It's the best and
fastest way to hook him up.

821
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:35,793
I'm not gonna hook up
a Cylon into the CIC.

822
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:38,546
Admiral, it is the only way. No.

823
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:41,090
And that means no.

824
01:02:41,675 --> 01:02:43,759
I'm not crossing
that line.

825
01:02:45,136 --> 01:02:48,305
You had us all cross a line.

826
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:54,353
Me, Sam, Lee,
the President, everyone.

827
01:02:56,022 --> 01:03:00,067
We are out here on
this crazy-ass mission

828
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:03,445
because you couldn't leave
that little girl behind.

829
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:07,783
It is time for you
to cross that line.

830
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:13,122
This ship,
this precious hunk of metal,

831
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:16,750
hooked up to a Cylon,
that hits you where it hurts?

832
01:03:16,835 --> 01:03:19,461
It's always
everyone else sacrificing

833
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:23,424
our blood,
our lives, our honor,

834
01:03:23,967 --> 01:03:29,513
while you stand there on your
high horse and we bleed around you.

835
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:31,432
For you.

836
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:41,650
I'll come back in a bit.

837
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:45,529
Chief.

838
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:50,075
Hook Anders up to CIC.

839
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:29,073
I need someone
to lead this Fleet

840
01:04:29,157 --> 01:04:32,576
who I trust and
demands universal respect.

841
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:36,955
So the Baseship and
the Fleet are yours.

842
01:04:40,502 --> 01:04:43,170
Thank you, sir.
I won't let you down.

843
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:46,048
I know you won't.

844
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:48,300
And I'll see you
at the rendezvous.

845
01:04:49,469 --> 01:04:52,763
If we're not there in 12
hours, we won't be coming.

846
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:54,223
Yes, sir.

847
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:58,644
Good hunting, sir.

848
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:01,063
Thank you,
Admiral Hoshi.

849
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:55,367
Still not too late to flush
them all out the airlock.

850
01:05:56,286 --> 01:05:57,619
Take too much time.

851
01:06:22,187 --> 01:06:25,981
I suppose this is what you
could call poetic justice.

852
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:29,985
Or what goes around,
comes around. Either way,

853
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:32,112
congratulations,
Mr. President.

854
01:06:32,197 --> 01:06:35,073
Thank you, Mr. Adama,
and the best of luck.

855
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:40,621
Admiral Hoshi, sir.
Sir.

856
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:46,001
The "sir" has...
Right. Good luck.

857
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:47,586
You too, sir.

858
01:06:49,923 --> 01:06:54,551
President of the Colonies,
Admiral of the Fleet, departing.

859
01:07:09,734 --> 01:07:13,320
All right, last Raptor out,
people, last Raptor out.

860
01:07:13,738 --> 01:07:16,740
Anyone left behind,
your ass belongs to us.

861
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,465
Great. Can we
tuck this in there?

862
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:38,053
Listen, I'm not
coming with you.

863
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:41,515
Gaius, please, Gaius, our people
need you. I've made up my mind.

864
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:45,018
I don't belong to you, Paulla.
I never belonged to you.

865
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:47,062
You appropriated me.

866
01:07:48,439 --> 01:07:51,900
I'm sorry. I'm sorry if
I led you to believe...

867
01:07:54,362 --> 01:07:55,779
They're all yours now,
Paulla. Enjoy them.

868
01:07:55,864 --> 01:07:58,156
Pilot,
you have your passengers.

869
01:07:58,241 --> 01:07:59,491
Gaius. Don't do this.

870
01:07:59,576 --> 01:08:01,952
Maybe I'll see you
in the next life.

871
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:10,669
Doctor.

872
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:25,267
This is so frakking crazy
I can barely stand it.

873
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:27,019
Have faith, Tory.

874
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:28,937
In what?

875
01:08:30,273 --> 01:08:31,899
Human ingenuity?

876
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:34,735
Luck of the Gods?
Random chance?

877
01:08:36,154 --> 01:08:37,696
We have to try.

878
01:08:38,448 --> 01:08:40,282
That little girl may
very well hold the key

879
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:43,660
to the survival of
the entire Cylon nation.

880
01:08:43,745 --> 01:08:46,413
If she can bear children... Children?

881
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:48,206
Who gives a frak?

882
01:08:48,917 --> 01:08:52,461
What about us? What,
we're supposed to die happy

883
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:57,299
because Hera can have kids and the
entire Cylon nation can survive?

884
01:08:58,509 --> 01:09:01,053
Come on. What good
does that do me?

885
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:22,783
Galactica.
Baseship actual.

886
01:09:22,867 --> 01:09:24,284
Flag has been transferred
to the Baseship,

887
01:09:24,369 --> 01:09:26,995
and our Vipers are ready to take
over CAP duties for the Fleet.

888
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:29,456
Roger that, Baseship.
You have the CAP.

889
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:32,042
Safe journey.
Godspeed, Galactica.

890
01:09:33,211 --> 01:09:35,212
Let's go around the horn.

891
01:09:40,468 --> 01:09:42,010
This is the XO.

892
01:09:42,887 --> 01:09:45,722
All combat stations
prepare to report.

893
01:09:46,057 --> 01:09:47,641
FTL.
Go.

894
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:50,602
We'll set up triage here. Just
prep the table the way that I do.

895
01:09:50,728 --> 01:09:52,396
Weapons.
Go.

896
01:09:53,147 --> 01:09:54,481
Tactical.
Separate out the wounded.

897
01:09:54,565 --> 01:09:57,567
Go. Those we can save,
and those we can't.

898
01:09:58,236 --> 01:09:59,903
Engineering.
Go.

899
01:09:59,988 --> 01:10:01,571
How will I know?

900
01:10:01,990 --> 01:10:03,073
Take this marker.

901
01:10:03,157 --> 01:10:04,866
Damage control.
Go.

902
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:06,827
Put an "X" on the forehead of
those who are too badly hurt,

903
01:10:06,911 --> 01:10:08,495
and you'll know
when you see them.

904
01:10:08,579 --> 01:10:10,789
Main batteries.
Go.

905
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:13,625
Engine room.
Go.

906
01:10:13,918 --> 01:10:15,293
We're next.

907
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:16,962
Sick bay.

908
01:10:20,758 --> 01:10:22,300
Sick bay to go.

909
01:10:23,803 --> 01:10:25,512
Viper wing.
Go.

910
01:10:26,681 --> 01:10:28,890
Assault One.
Go.

911
01:10:33,312 --> 01:10:35,063
Assault Two.

912
01:10:36,691 --> 01:10:37,691
Go.

913
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:39,276
Reserve forces.

914
01:10:39,736 --> 01:10:40,777
Go.

915
01:10:42,321 --> 01:10:44,448
Com One.
Go.

916
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:49,578
Sorry.
Caprica.

917
01:10:50,455 --> 01:10:52,039
Com Two.
Go.

918
01:10:57,128 --> 01:10:59,087
What are you
doing here?

919
01:11:00,965 --> 01:11:03,341
I don't think
you should be here.

920
01:11:04,343 --> 01:11:07,262
Probably been in more
battles than you have.

921
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:13,643
Fair point.
Life support.

922
01:11:14,854 --> 01:11:17,105
Emergency
systems standing by.

923
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:21,526
Yeah, I suppose the more pertinent
question is what am I doing here.

924
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:25,739
What the hell
was I thinking?

925
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:31,578
Secure blast doors
on all decks.

926
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:39,711
Ellen.

927
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:42,380
I think we're
a go up here.

928
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:44,966
All stations report, sir.

929
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:48,428
Connect me just
to the ship.

930
01:11:50,014 --> 01:11:51,723
This is the Admiral.

931
01:11:51,808 --> 01:11:54,851
Just so there'll be
no misunderstandings later,

932
01:11:56,938 --> 01:11:59,147
Galactica's seen
a lot of history,

933
01:12:00,024 --> 01:12:02,067
gone through
a lot of battles,

934
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:05,278
this will be her last.

935
01:12:07,532 --> 01:12:09,282
She will not fail us

936
01:12:10,284 --> 01:12:12,160
if we do not fail her.

937
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:16,581
If we succeed in our mission,
Galactica will bring us home.

938
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:19,459
If we don't,

939
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:22,671
it doesn't matter anyway.

940
01:12:23,881 --> 01:12:25,465
Action stations!

941
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:29,386
Start the clock.
Start the clock.

942
01:12:29,512 --> 01:12:31,096
Jump on my mark.

943
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:37,144
Five, four, three,
two, one. Mark.

944
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:30,614
We can't take
much of this.

945
01:13:42,793 --> 01:13:44,336
It's time, Sam.

946
01:14:07,818 --> 01:14:09,778
Look through the eye
to know thyself.

947
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:30,465
One of the Final Five must
be disrupting our systems.

948
01:14:30,549 --> 01:14:32,634
It's Anders.
Has to be.

949
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:36,054
He's hooked up to
the frakking Hybrids somehow.

950
01:14:36,722 --> 01:14:39,015
We gotta do this
the hard way.

951
01:14:46,107 --> 01:14:47,524
The colony
Hybrids are offline.

952
01:14:47,608 --> 01:14:49,442
They'll be launching
Raiders any minute.

953
01:14:49,527 --> 01:14:50,527
Go.

954
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:52,946
Launch all wings.

955
01:15:13,926 --> 01:15:15,468
Birds are away.

956
01:15:16,053 --> 01:15:20,348
All ahead, flank speed.
Three, two, one. Hit it!

957
01:15:20,975 --> 01:15:23,059
All hands
brace for impact.

958
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:26,688
Assault One, standby.

959
01:16:21,452 --> 01:16:23,787
Here they come,
let's take them!

960
01:16:32,630 --> 01:16:34,047
Light it up.

961
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:41,304
Assault team, on me.

962
01:16:50,231 --> 01:16:52,273
You guys scout
me out, okay?

963
01:17:13,963 --> 01:17:17,215
Pressure. We've got
pressure, sir. One atmosphere.

964
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:19,968
Assault One,
we got pressure.

965
01:17:25,099 --> 01:17:27,058
Alpha Team,
helmets off.

966
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:44,742
Move out.

967
01:17:55,838 --> 01:17:57,380
I think we lost Cartwheel.

968
01:17:57,464 --> 01:17:59,174
Dradis is almost
useless out here.

969
01:17:59,258 --> 01:18:02,260
I hope that works both ways. Any
sign they've spotted our approach?

970
01:18:02,344 --> 01:18:03,761
I haven't looked at the
instruments in a while.

971
01:18:03,846 --> 01:18:05,638
I don't think you
want me to start now.

972
01:18:05,723 --> 01:18:06,973
Maybe not.

973
01:18:07,057 --> 01:18:09,851
Let's go weapons hot,
Skulls. We're getting close.

974
01:18:09,935 --> 01:18:10,935
You sure about that?

975
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:15,273
No, but I don't wanna come out of
this crap with cold weapons, either.

976
01:18:17,651 --> 01:18:19,110
Nukes are hot.

977
01:18:20,654 --> 01:18:23,531
You know, this reminds me
of that time back during...

978
01:18:35,085 --> 01:18:38,796
Battery Three, redirect your
fire 10 degrees starboard.

979
01:18:38,881 --> 01:18:41,007
Concentrate on taking out
the Cylon batteries.

980
01:18:41,091 --> 01:18:42,342
Hotdog and Ladykiller,

981
01:18:42,426 --> 01:18:46,554
concentrate on taking out Cylon
Raiders coming in at 084 count...

982
01:18:46,889 --> 01:18:49,307
All right, Galactica.
We got them.

983
01:19:04,949 --> 01:19:06,950
We have
a hard seal. Go.

984
01:19:53,998 --> 01:19:56,207
You're gonna just
keep doing the tests?

985
01:19:56,292 --> 01:19:58,459
Even with the colony
coming down around your ears?

986
01:19:58,544 --> 01:20:00,545
I think you overestimate
their chances.

987
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:02,755
They may have confused
our Hybrids temporarily,

988
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:05,591
but we have superior
firepower and superior numbers,

989
01:20:05,676 --> 01:20:08,553
and in the end,
it's all about mathematics.

990
01:20:50,137 --> 01:20:52,013
Sam. Sam, listen to me.

991
01:20:52,139 --> 01:20:53,765
You're pushing too much
energy through the ACS.

992
01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:57,393
You gotta back off, or you're gonna
blow the main bus, you hear me?

993
01:20:57,478 --> 01:20:58,519
Sam!

994
01:21:00,105 --> 01:21:02,732
There are secrets within
lies, answers within riddles.

995
01:21:02,816 --> 01:21:04,734
Lay off the ACS,
you betcha, Galen.

996
01:21:04,818 --> 01:21:08,946
Open your mind and hear what your
heart wants to deny. End of line.

997
01:21:15,662 --> 01:21:17,872
You never should
have trusted her.

998
01:21:17,956 --> 01:21:19,665
Trust didn't
enter into it.

999
01:21:19,833 --> 01:21:24,003
I simply miscalculated her need
to engage in gestures of futility.

1000
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:27,090
We have to assume that
she'll try to make contact

1001
01:21:27,174 --> 01:21:30,093
with the Colonial forces
aboard the colony.

1002
01:21:30,677 --> 01:21:32,428
It's time to go
on the offensive.

1003
01:21:32,513 --> 01:21:36,182
We must be cautious. Too much
force could risk killing the child.

1004
01:21:36,266 --> 01:21:37,934
Really? You think?

1005
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:41,104
Please continue stating
the perfectly obvious.

1006
01:21:41,188 --> 01:21:43,106
It fills me
with confidence.

1007
01:21:54,535 --> 01:21:56,160
I'm proud of you.

1008
01:21:58,997 --> 01:22:00,081
What?

1009
01:22:01,875 --> 01:22:03,376
For doing this.

1010
01:22:03,544 --> 01:22:05,628
For being here when you
could've just walked away.

1011
01:22:05,712 --> 01:22:10,299
I don't think I ever said it before,
but I always wanted to be proud of you.

1012
01:22:14,805 --> 01:22:18,099
Guess I always felt that
was the only thing missing.

1013
01:22:32,406 --> 01:22:35,032
All the pieces are
falling into place.

1014
01:22:43,333 --> 01:22:47,086
You will hold the future of
Cylons and humans in your hands.

1015
01:22:47,588 --> 01:22:49,213
I will?
I will?

1016
01:22:51,758 --> 01:22:53,843
You see them?
You see them?

1017
01:22:58,849 --> 01:22:59,849
Reconnect me!

1018
01:22:59,933 --> 01:23:02,810
Cylons just blew
a hole into Deck 21.

1019
01:23:02,895 --> 01:23:05,855
Frakking Centurions will be
pouring in at platoon strength.
