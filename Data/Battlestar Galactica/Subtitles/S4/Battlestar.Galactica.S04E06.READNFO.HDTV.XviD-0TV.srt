1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,770
TWELVE Cylon MODELS

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,140
SEVEN ARE KNOWN

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,130
FOUR LIVE IN SECRET

4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,790
ONE WILL BE REVEALED

5
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,215
Previously on Battlestar Galactica.

6
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:26,780
Madame President,
are you taking Chamalla again?

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,490
I am taking Chamalla again
because my cancer has returned.

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,905
I remember a flashing triple star,

9
00:00:35,005 --> 00:00:39,175
a giant gas planet with
rings, and a comet.

10
00:00:39,275 --> 00:00:40,965
What's the latest, Felix?

11
00:00:41,065 --> 00:00:42,205
She's reversing course,

12
00:00:42,305 --> 00:00:43,990
returning to sector seven.

13
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:45,850
Oh, that is the tenth course correction.

14
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,280
Frak me.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,280
They're going to attack.

16
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:51,330
Alert the others.

17
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,030
We need to jump now.

18
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:57,695
Just remember, they started it.

19
00:00:57,795 --> 00:00:58,960
But we're killing them.

20
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,080
We are truly killing them.

21
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,510
DRADIS contact.

22
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,460
I've got visual.

23
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,965
Cylon heavy raider.

24
00:01:06,065 --> 00:01:08,060
Kara, I'm alone.
This is not an attack.

25
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,405
I knew I'd find you.

26
00:01:09,505 --> 00:01:10,425
Leoben.

27
00:01:10,525 --> 00:01:11,705
I'm here for you,

28
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:14,460
to offer a truce
between Human and Cylon

29
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,820
and a chance for you to
complete your journey.

30
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,100
The Hybrid.

31
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,405
You need to go to her, Kara.

32
00:01:21,505 --> 00:01:23,735
She'll tell you
the way to get to Earth.

33
00:01:23,835 --> 00:01:25,040
We're done here.

34
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,565
Get him out of here.

35
00:01:26,665 --> 00:01:28,550
This baseship was never
part of the mission.

36
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:31,965
If we don't leave right now,
we are all going to die.

37
00:01:32,065 --> 00:01:33,950
We're ready to jump back
to the fleet on your order.

38
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,270
We're not going back to the fleet.

39
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,095
What the hell are you talking about?

40
00:01:36,195 --> 00:01:37,670
We came out here to complete a mission,

41
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,965
and that baseship has something
to do with it. I know it.

42
00:01:40,065 --> 00:01:42,755
Captain Thrace, as XO of the Demetrius,

43
00:01:42,855 --> 00:01:45,520
I'm hereby relieving you of command.

44
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,810
You son of a bitch.

45
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,410
I'll do it myself.

46
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,005
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

47
00:02:03,105 --> 00:02:04,340
Stand down!

48
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,540
Order the marine guards
to the control room.

49
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,620
Tell them I'm placing
Captain Thrace under arrest.

50
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:17,860
You're wrong, Helo.

51
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,335
You're so godsdamn wrong.

52
00:02:19,435 --> 00:02:22,470
Either way, we're taking Leoben
and his proposal back to the fleet.

53
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,710
We'll let the admiral sort it out.

54
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,205
You are throwing away our
last chance to find Earth.

55
00:02:26,305 --> 00:02:28,570
And you'll be going back
to Galactica as mutineers.

56
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,980
How do you think the admiral's
gonna sort through that?

57
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,260
That's up to him.

58
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:35,830
Mr. Gaeta, reset the FTL for the
first jump back to the fleet.

59
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,290
Right away, sir.

60
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,850
We should just airlock your Cylon ass.

61
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,340
I am not a Cylon.

62
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,490
Gaeta, stop!

63
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,310
Gaeta, abort the jump!

64
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,390
I said, abort the jump!

65
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,520
Oh, frak.

66
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,865
You want to know who's in charge?

67
00:03:05,965 --> 00:03:07,735
You want to know who's in command?
You frakkin' want to know?

68
00:03:07,835 --> 00:03:08,710
Sam!

69
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,335
It's Captain Thrace, godsdamn it!

70
00:03:10,435 --> 00:03:11,045
Now you let her go!

71
00:03:11,145 --> 00:03:12,220
Sergeant, stand down.

72
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,353
Stand down, sergeant!

73
00:03:13,903 --> 00:03:14,835
Stand down, sergeant!

74
00:03:14,935 --> 00:03:16,220
You've got your orders.

75
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,530
Seelix, stand down.

76
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,385
Stand down, stand down.

77
00:03:19,485 --> 00:03:20,670
Medic!

78
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,335
- What the frak?
- Easy...

79
00:03:23,435 --> 00:03:25,500
- I need a med kit!
- Just stay away from me!

80
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,550
Frak!

81
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,720
What the frak?

82
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,320
All right, bloodstopper.

83
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,340
This is gonna hurt.

84
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,060
Ready, go.

85
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,840
Get off me, you frakkin' bitch!

86
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,230
Morpha.

87
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,400
We need to move him to a bunk.

88
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,710
Marines, get over here!

89
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,010
Easy. Easy!

90
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,230
Careful!

91
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,735
W-wait, listen.

92
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:14,495
- Kara, that was...
- So now what?

93
00:04:14,595 --> 00:04:16,430
Gonna give orders at gunpoint?

94
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,305
You're right, Helo.

95
00:04:18,405 --> 00:04:20,870
I never should've ordered Demetrius
to jump to the baseship.

96
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,900
Too many lives to risk
on a gut instinct.

97
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,485
So Demetrius goes back to the fleet?

98
00:04:25,585 --> 00:04:27,160
Missing a raptor.

99
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,040
I'm gonna take Leoben
back to the baseship,

100
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,380
see if his story checks out.

101
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,240
Are you insane?

102
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,600
The two of you alone?

103
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,170
- She's not going alone.
<i>- Frak...</i>

104
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,730
I'm going with her.

105
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,070
This is crazy, but I need you.

106
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:39,680
What?

107
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,450
I need someone that
speaks their language.

108
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:44,290
If this is a trap,
I want to know about it.

109
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,830
Hell, yeah, let the Cylon go.

110
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,750
It's okay.

111
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,610
I'll do it.

112
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,330
No, listen to me.

113
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,785
Your raptor doesn't have enough
fuel to get back to Galactica.

114
00:04:56,885 --> 00:04:58,420
But the baseship does.

115
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,730
We were sent out here by the
admiral to complete a mission.

116
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,280
Not for me, but for the
people of the fleet.

117
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,590
And if I'm right,
the payoff is Earth.

118
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,655
Lt. Costanza, what's the
latest we can leave here

119
00:05:14,755 --> 00:05:17,170
and still make the
rendezvous with the fleet?

120
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,735
Window closes 15 hours
and seven minutes.

121
00:05:22,835 --> 00:05:25,370
And that's cutting
it really damn close.

122
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,270
Set the clock to 15 hours
and seven minutes and start it.

123
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,410
We'll be waiting here
till the clock runs out.

Season 04 Episode 06

131
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:30,670
So I guess just pack up
everything that's here.

132
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,290
Pack up all of these drafts.

133
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,050
I'm gonna have plenty of time on my
hands over the next couple of days,

134
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,590
so pack it up.

135
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,860
Hey, at least the worst is over.

136
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,440
Two more doloxan treatments
and you will be over the hump.

137
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,400
And I'm gonna need you to

138
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,885
really keep an eye
on things until then.

139
00:06:46,985 --> 00:06:48,010
Don't worry.

140
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,025
I'll make sure our friend from Picon
sees the error of his ways.

141
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,135
I'm not just talking
about the quorum, Tory.

142
00:06:54,235 --> 00:06:55,525
There was a time a few months ago

143
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:58,532
when you seemed overwhelmed
by the stresses...

144
00:06:58,632 --> 00:07:00,510
and the pressures of this job.

145
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,910
But lately you've really stepped up.

146
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:05,426
And I'm gonna be demanding
even more of that from you

147
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:07,470
in the days to come, because

148
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,370
I'm not quite sure of
what I'm doing right--

149
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,610
I'm sort of--

150
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,530
I'm just gonna need
you to keep a keen eye

151
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,860
on every single thing
that comes across this desk.

152
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:25,135
I appreciate your
confidence, Madame President.

153
00:07:25,235 --> 00:07:26,630

Just remember:
If this is a trap,

157
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:43,750
you die first.

158
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,090
Preflight is complete.

159
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:53,950
I need to know.

160
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,435
Do I need to watch my
back with you on this?

161
00:07:56,535 --> 00:07:58,045
No, I said I'd go.

162
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,680
You have my word.

163
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,410
It will be like
a homecoming for you.

164
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,780
The other Eights talk
about you all the time.

165
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,760
Keep him the frak away from me.

166
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,165
Barolay, I didn't ask for volunteers.

167
00:08:16,265 --> 00:08:18,210
Yeah, you did,
a while back on Galactica.

168
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,455
Look, I don't give a frak
what the rest of them think.

169
00:08:20,555 --> 00:08:22,355
You've been kicking ass since day one.

170
00:08:22,655 --> 00:08:25,465
You say you can find Earth,
I want to be there when you do.

171
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,660
You have 14 hours and 40 minutes.

172
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,315
Godspeed.

173
00:08:50,415 --> 00:08:51,720
Copy that.

174
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,700
Can you feel it?

175
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,320
The anticipation.

176
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,095
God's plan is about to be revealed.

177
00:09:03,195 --> 00:09:05,130
You better hope so for your sake.

178
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,390
Three, two, one, jump.

179
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,490
Multiple contacts, all quadrants.

180
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,290
Huh, looks like we found
what's left of them.

181
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,870
How you doing, Felix?

182
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,740
Never better.

183
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,840
Those frakkers won't
give me any more morpha.

184
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,330
Afraid I'll o.d. or something.

185
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,270
Yeah, I know.

186
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,930
Will you promise me something?

187
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,770
Anything.

188
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,200
Don't let Cottle take my leg.

189
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,935
Hey, you're gonna be all right.

190
00:10:10,035 --> 00:10:11,915
Don't frak with me.

191
00:10:12,015 --> 00:10:13,330
Karl.

192
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:18,730
I know every minute
that we stay here

193
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,760
means it's more likely
that he's gonna have to.

194
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,540
Please.

195
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,330
Okay, promise me.

196
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:33,970
Felix, you know damn well I won't
leave until the clock runs out.

197
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,745
all right, where's the baseship?

198
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:45,795
I don't know.

199
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,635
If it's still in one piece,
DRADIS is too cluttered to see it.

200
00:10:48,735 --> 00:10:49,595
Hey, watch yourselves.

201
00:10:49,695 --> 00:10:52,610
We've got ordnance popping off
all over the place out there.

202
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,450
Looks like he wasn't
lying about a civil war.

203
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,830
This is it.

204
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,870
This is the place.

205
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,390
I can hear it.

206
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:18,870
The unstruck music
vibrates in all of us.

207
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,640
Few can hear it.

208
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,100
Kara's one of the few.

209
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,110
Got a course for us?

210
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,330
Give me the ship.

211
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:46,170
Starbuck, you have any
idea where you're going?

212
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,910
The comet.

213
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:04,270
The... it's the ship.

214
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:21,890
This is what I was meant to see.

215
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,840
Incoming, right, two high!

216
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,410
Break, break, break!

217
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,535
She's back.

218
00:12:52,635 --> 00:12:54,355
Hey, hey, shh.

219
00:12:54,455 --> 00:12:56,330
Oh, frak.

220
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,575
Kara...hey, no, shh!

221
00:12:59,675 --> 00:13:01,000
Take it easy, Kara.

222
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:01,985
Everybody made it okay.

223
00:13:02,085 --> 00:13:03,070
You're gonna be fine.

224
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,780
No, don't touch it.

225
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,015
We need to get her out of here

226
00:13:07,115 --> 00:13:08,780
and get her some air.

227
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,720
Get the frak away from me!

228
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,490
They call you Athena now.

229
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:33,020
You even wear their uniform
like you're one of them.

230
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,420
You were the first to say no.

231
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,010
No to what?

232
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,285
The entire plan.

233
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:40,280
You joined the Humans.

234
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,800
You had a child.

235
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,350
You showed us that we don't have
to be slaves to our programming.

236
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:50,350
We wanted the same thing,
but it turned out to be a disaster.

237
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:54,470
The Sixes have made one
mistake after another.

238
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,570
They have to be stopped before
they get the rest of us killed.

239
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,430
Ask.

240
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,630
You could help us.

241
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,060
You want me to lead a
mutiny against the Sixes.

242
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,765
It's the only way.

243
00:14:09,865 --> 00:14:11,130
You guys make me sick.

244
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,120
Why?

245
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,920
Because you pick your
side and you stick.

246
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,930
You don't cut and run
when things get ugly.

247
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,560
Otherwise you'll never have anything.

248
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,530
No love, no family.

249
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,970
No life to call your own.

250
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,860
Now you guys can either help me
or get the hell out of my way.

251
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,090
<i>...'cause he will take your hand...</i>

252
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:37,090
<i>...guide you to the other side...</i>

253
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,005
I'll just come back later,

254
00:14:42,105 --> 00:14:43,800
when you're feeling a little better.

255
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,270
Can't you read a chart?

256
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:46,965
I'm not gonna feel better.

257
00:14:47,065 --> 00:14:47,927
- So take your needles
<i>-...I'm talking about...</i>

258
00:14:48,027 --> 00:14:48,935
and your thermometers

259
00:14:49,035 --> 00:14:51,870
and your catheters and stick 'em
where the sun doesn't shine!

260
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:52,910
<i>...when we...</i>

261
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,770
<i>...shuffle off this mortal coil...</i>

262
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,680
<i>...the undiscovered country...</i>

263
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,780
<i>...from whose bourn
no traveller returns...</i>

264
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:03,950
- Hello.
<i>-...waiting for the...</i>

265
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,220
Oh, great.

266
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,720
Now the president.

267
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,660
She stuck me three times today.

268
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,960
<i>...it's a better place, friend...</i>

269
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,710
Be thankful she hasn't
put a catheter in you.

270
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,585
<i>...where we will bask in the
radiance of God's love...</i>

271
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:21,630
- All this just to
<i>-...how do we get there...</i>

272
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,270
keep me alive for a few more days.

273
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,965
- It's so pointless.
<i>-...reaching out...</i>

274
00:15:28,065 --> 00:15:29,647
No, it's not pointless.

275
00:15:29,747 --> 00:15:31,590
<i>...to one another...</i>

276
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,995
And I'm sure it isn't helping
listening to Gaius Baltar...

277
00:15:35,095 --> 00:15:36,745
No, no, no, don't touch that!

278
00:15:36,845 --> 00:15:38,460
Who the frak do you think you are?

279
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,255
<i>...accept him into your hearts...</i>

280
00:15:40,355 --> 00:15:41,780
Leave me alone!

281
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,780
<i>-...love...</i>

282
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,910
<i>...God doesn't really care how
many good deeds we've done...</i>

283
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:57,300
<i>...this is the mistake that
I find that so many of the pious...</i>

284
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,710
The Hybrid will want
to see you, I know it.

285
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:00,515
Let's go then.

286
00:16:00,615 --> 00:16:01,680
What are you doing?

287
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:05,135
You want to give her access to the
central nervous system of this ship?

288
00:16:05,235 --> 00:16:06,140
I thought we had a deal.

289
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,740
We discussed this.

290
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:09,420
Kara's the key to our salvation.

291
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,930
We agreed on an alliance.

292
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,270
You want an alliance,
I see the Hybrid.

293
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,570
Leoben claims it can
help me find Earth.

294
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,285
There's no way around it.

295
00:16:18,385 --> 00:16:21,795
We've tried to be patient about your
model's obsession with this woman.

296
00:16:21,895 --> 00:16:24,160
Playing house with her
on New Caprica was one thing,

297
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,820
but this puts us all in jeopardy.

298
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,520
We have their raptor
and their jump drive.

299
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,520
We don't need them.

300
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,210
- Frakkin' toaster...
- Barolay, don't.

301
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:36,395
You don't have time to figure out
our jump systems without our help.

302
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,150
Not before the other Cylons get back.

303
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:42,610
And if we do figure it out in time,
do we just keep running?

304
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,330
How long before we run out of fuel,
food, ammunition?

305
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,555
How long before Cavil's
forces hunt us down?

306
00:16:47,655 --> 00:16:50,075
Like it or not,
we have to work with the colonials.

307
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:53,720
That means Kara sees the Hybrid.

308
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,340
Or you can kiss your asses good-bye.

309
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,080
Looks as if we have no choice.

310
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,810
But first, we do this.

311
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,100
Okay, we can do this.

312
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,165
We can give their ship
jump capability again

313
00:17:20,265 --> 00:17:22,855
by slaving its drives to our
raptor's spin sync generator.

314
00:17:22,955 --> 00:17:24,350
So just do it.

315
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,285
Their Hybrid was damaged
during the attacks,

316
00:17:26,385 --> 00:17:29,740
so we're gonna have to pull her offline
and execute jumps from the raptor.

317
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,575
Pull the Hybrid offline?
Absolutely not.

318
00:17:32,675 --> 00:17:34,495
It's never been done on
an operational ship.

319
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:35,735
It would be like blinding her.

320
00:17:35,835 --> 00:17:36,535
It might even kill her.

321
00:17:36,635 --> 00:17:38,785
You know, if we don't get this done
before the other Cylons come back,

322
00:17:38,885 --> 00:17:40,460
we're all dead anyway.

323
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,930
Make it happen, Lieutenant.

324
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,665
Barolay, yank the
connectors from the bus

325
00:17:52,765 --> 00:17:54,930
I showed you and strip
the cables out of them.

326
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,600
You got it, LT.

327
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:59,830
And, Six, I'm gonna need some
data cabling right away.

328
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:03,540
Single mode, 1310, otherwise
you'll blow our system to shreds.

329
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,050
We started the interface.

330
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,940
Take me to this Hybrid.

331
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,580
Anders, you're on me.

332
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,855
Might be better if I stay here.

333
00:18:12,955 --> 00:18:15,165
I know more about the raptor's
system than they do.

334
00:18:15,265 --> 00:18:16,500
Fine.

335
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,840
What the hell are you looking at?

336
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,290
I know you.

337
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:38,945
You were on New Caprica.

338
00:18:39,045 --> 00:18:41,090
You were part of the resistance.

339
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,350
You killed me.

340
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:48,750
Watched me drown, kicking and thrashing
like I was some kind of an insect.

341
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:50,610
Well, I'd be happy
to put you down again.

342
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:02,790
I'm okay.

343
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:08,610
Barolay?

344
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:11,000
Hey, hey, Jean.

345
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:11,885
Hey.

346
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,230
Jean!

347
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,090
You killed her.

348
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,360
You frakkin' killed her!

349
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,045
You want to know what
it feels like to die, huh?

350
00:19:35,145 --> 00:19:35,855
You're nothing!

351
00:19:35,955 --> 00:19:37,195
You're a frakkin' machine!

352
00:19:37,295 --> 00:19:38,530
- Sam, put the gun down now!
- You're nothing!

353
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,805
Sam, stop!

354
00:19:39,905 --> 00:19:41,330
What do you want me to do, Kara?

355
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,825
You want me to forget about Barolay?

356
00:19:42,925 --> 00:19:43,900
You want me to forget
about New Caprica?

357
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:45,560
No frakkin' way!

358
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,710
- She just killed Barolay!
- Sam!

359
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,640
Put the gun down.

360
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,240
- Put it down.
- I'm not gonna do it.

361
00:19:58,490 --> 00:19:59,810
Sam.

362
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:04,775
Sam, you have no idea
what's at stake here.

363
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:06,460
Look at me.

364
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,720
Put it down.

365
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:11,475
They killed one of us and
you're just ready to let it slide?

366
00:20:11,575 --> 00:20:12,645
She's right.

367
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:15,360
You can't let this go, Kara.

368
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,920
If you don't want
to do this, I will.

369
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,990
Put the gun down, soldier.

370
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,130
I need to see the Hybrid.

371
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,290
Why, sister?

372
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,970
I just couldn't let it go.

373
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,130
On New Caprica.

374
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,440
She was the one?

375
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,855
I never did anything to her.

376
00:20:34,955 --> 00:20:37,555
We were working at the water
treatment plant and she just...

377
00:20:37,655 --> 00:20:40,015
I know. I remember.

378
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:42,555
After you downloaded,
we tried to work through this.

379
00:20:42,655 --> 00:20:45,520
How do you work through
something like that?

380
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:49,585
Never forget her expression
as I tried to scream.

381
00:20:49,685 --> 00:20:56,505
Just... just slapped tape over my mouth
and threw me in that septic tank.

382
00:20:56,605 --> 00:20:57,915
You shut your frakkin' mouth.

383
00:20:58,015 --> 00:21:00,960
I still see her face
when I try to sleep.

384
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,480
We were trying to help those people.

385
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,000
I know.

386
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,230
I know. I wish there was
something I could do.

387
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,570
Then I'm glad it's you.

388
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,820
Gods damn it!

389
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:49,170
No resurrection ship.

390
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:50,975
You understand?

391
00:21:51,075 --> 00:21:53,670
She's just as dead as your friend.

392
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,620
Is that enough human justice for you?

393
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,510
Blood for blood?

394
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,900
Madame President.

395
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,105
I wanted to apologize for before.

396
00:22:25,205 --> 00:22:28,820
I-I have good moments and bad.

397
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,910
And that was which?

398
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,265
Come in here.

399
00:22:34,365 --> 00:22:35,915
I have something for you.

400
00:22:36,015 --> 00:22:38,670
- For me?
- Yes, yes, come in. Come in.

401
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:41,975
Would you get it?

402
00:22:42,075 --> 00:22:44,135
It's in the first drawer.
Right here.

403
00:22:44,235 --> 00:22:46,490
That's it, yes.

404
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,755
This is for me?

405
00:22:47,855 --> 00:22:50,000
I hope it's not too gaudy.

406
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,675
No.

407
00:22:51,775 --> 00:22:53,340
This is beautiful.

408
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,515
Thank you.
That's beautiful.

409
00:22:55,615 --> 00:22:58,515
A woman on Aurora makes 'em.
Leslie Starus.

410
00:22:58,615 --> 00:23:02,295
She makes all kinds,
if you want to check it out.

411
00:23:02,895 --> 00:23:06,640
Now, I think this one
will be just fine.

412
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,540
What color are you hoping for?

413
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:12,510
When it grows back in?

414
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:14,410
Um, well.

415
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:17,865
I was thinking maybe blue.

416
00:23:17,965 --> 00:23:19,200
Nice royal blue.

417
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,710
Change of pace.

418
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:30,590
Oh, my hair used to be...
Now look at it.

419
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:32,500
Feel it, feel it.

420
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:42,430
It's gonna get a lot worse.

421
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,870
Be prepared for that.

422
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:49,930
<i>...because he will take
our hands and guide us...</i>

423
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:52,610
<i>to the other side of the river...</i>

424
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,640
All these things at once and many more.

425
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:58,327
<i>...not because it wishes
harm, but because it likes</i>

426
00:23:58,427 --> 00:24:01,165
<i>violent vibrations
<i>to change constantly.

427
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,280
<i>Then shall the maidens
rejoice at the dance.</i>

428
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,380
<i>Structural integrity of
node seven restored.</i>

429
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,000
<i>Repressurizing.</i>

430
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:12,685
<i>The children of the one reborn
shall find their own country.</i>

431
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:14,610
<i>The intruders swarmed like flame.</i>

432
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:16,095
Like the whirlwind.

433
00:24:16,195 --> 00:24:19,410
<i>hopes soaring to slaughter
all their best against our hulls.</i>

434
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,310
I'm here.

435
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:21,680
You wanted me here, so...

436
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:24,815
<i>replace internal control
accumulators 4 through 19.</i>

437
00:24:24,915 --> 00:24:27,020
They'll start going
ripe on us pretty soon.

438
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,445
<i>Compartmentalize integrity conflicts
with the obligation to provide access.</i>

439
00:24:31,545 --> 00:24:34,325
<i>FTL sync fault uncorrected.</i>

440
00:24:34,425 --> 00:24:36,840
No ceremonies are necessary.

441
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:40,375
For what it's worth,
I voted for you in the last election.

442
00:24:40,475 --> 00:24:44,045
And I don't like how Baltar
keeps ragging on you.

443
00:24:44,145 --> 00:24:46,515
That is not why I listen to him.

444
00:24:46,615 --> 00:24:48,105
Why do you listen to him?

445
00:24:48,205 --> 00:24:53,440
I had an experience that made me
rethink all my preconceptions.

446
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,470
What kind of experience?

447
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:57,695
It happened the night
after Cottle told me

448
00:24:57,795 --> 00:25:03,320
that my cancer had spread to my liver
and I'd never be leaving this place.

449
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,760
I was on a ferry crossing a river,

450
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:09,570
and as we were
approaching the other side

451
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:13,655
I saw all these people
standing on the bank.

452
00:25:13,755 --> 00:25:17,905
And we got closer,
and I recognized them.

453
00:25:18,005 --> 00:25:19,930
My parents.

454
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:23,180
My sister Kathy,
who died when I was 12.

455
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,090
My husband, my girls.

456
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:30,835
I-I was scared for a moment.

457
00:25:30,935 --> 00:25:33,370
You know, how is this happening?

458
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:39,250
But then I-I felt it. This...

459
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:42,760
presence,

460
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,080
hovering all around me.

461
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:49,250
Warm, loving, and...

462
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,060
it said:

463
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,595
"Don't be scared, Emily.

464
00:25:54,695 --> 00:25:56,860
"I'm with you.

465
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,290
"Hold my hand and we'll
cross over together."

466
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:04,840
But a lot of people in our predicament
have dreams like that, Emily.

467
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:05,829
No.

468
00:26:06,579 --> 00:26:08,090
I was there.

469
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,570
I felt...

470
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,785
the cool breeze coming from the water,

471
00:26:13,885 --> 00:26:16,340
the spray from the bow.

472
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:20,445
Maybe he's stumbled onto something.

473
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:25,385
You know, he talks about the river
that separates our world from the next.

474
00:26:25,485 --> 00:26:28,740
That...that there's more
to this existence...

475
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,360
than we can see with our naked eye.

476
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:36,160
There's a power that we
can't begin to understand.

477
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:45,390
<i>Then shall the maidens
rejoice at the dance.</i>

478
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:48,560

479
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,500

<i>The children of the One Reborn

481
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,820
<i>End of line.</i>

482
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,300
<i>Reset.</i>

483
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,155
<i>Track mode monitor malfunction traced.</i>

484
00:27:00,255 --> 00:27:01,960
<i>Recharge compressors.</i>

485
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,390
<i>Increase the output to 50%.</i>

486
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,880
<i>Assume the relaxation length of photons.</i>

<i>Transfers contact is inevitable,

00:27:11,295 --> 00:27:13,970
<i>FTL sync fault stands uncorrected.</i>

489
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,365
<i>- No ceremonies are necessary.</i>
- I don't understand.

490
00:27:16,465 --> 00:27:19,885
Centrifugal force reacts to the
rotating frame of reference.

491
00:27:19,985 --> 00:27:22,645
<i>The obstinate toy soldier
becomes compliant.</i>

492
00:27:22,745 --> 00:27:24,105
<i>The city devours the land.</i>

493
00:27:24,205 --> 00:27:25,490
You can't hurry her.

494
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:28,750
You have to absorb her words.

495
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:31,950
Allow them to caress
your associative mind.

496
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,935
Don't expect the fate of two great
races to be delivered easily.

497
00:27:36,035 --> 00:27:40,130
<i>Assume the relaxation length of photons
in the sample atmosphere is constant.</i>

498
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:42,125
<i>The intruders swarmed like flame.</i>

00:27:42,225 --> 00:27:43,575

<i>Not because it wishes harm,</i>

<i>but because it likes violent

504
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,320
Hey, we're rigged and ready.

505
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,200
It's time to pull her
offline and get out...

506
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,640
of here before we miss our rendezvous.

507
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,685
Reset.

508
00:28:28,785 --> 00:28:29,800
Any luck, captain?

509
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,730
Not a frakkin' thing.

510
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:34,985
But you are a spark of God's fire.

511
00:28:35,085 --> 00:28:36,685
Core update complete.

512
00:28:36,785 --> 00:28:37,530
Frak it!

513
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,825
Unplug the damn thing.
Let's get the frak out of here.

514
00:28:39,925 --> 00:28:42,170
Threat detection matrix enabled.

515
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:44,400

Execute.

519
00:28:49,685 --> 00:28:52,810
The children of the One Reborn

Stop!

522
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:10,200
What the hell happened?

523
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,140
What do you want from me?

524
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:34,880
Please, I need you.

525
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:46,300
Thus will it come to pass.

526
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,925
The dying leader will know
the truth of the opera house.

527
00:29:50,025 --> 00:29:55,490
The missing three will give you the five
who have come from the home of the 13th.

528
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:58,620
You are the harbinger
of death, Kara Thrace.

529
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,170
You will lead them all to their end.

End of line.

531
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:24,960
But this God that Baltar refers to,

532
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,630
it is the Cylon god.

533
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:29,380
You know that, don't you?

534
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:34,535
If he's the one and true God,
he belongs to all of us.

535
00:30:34,635 --> 00:30:37,435
Otherwise, he's not
much of a god, is he?

536
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:40,315
Exactly. He isn't much of
a god. He's a fantasy.

537
00:30:40,415 --> 00:30:42,050
Oh, Laura.

538
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:44,450
And the Lords of Kobol are real?

539
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:50,200
Reigning from a metaphysical
mountaintop in those silly outfits.

540
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:53,761
Zeus handing out fates
out of an urn like...

541
00:30:53,861 --> 00:30:56,285
like they were lottery tickets.

542
00:30:56,385 --> 00:30:58,000
"You're gonna work on a tylium ship.

543
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,255
"You're gonna be an admiral.

544
00:30:59,355 --> 00:31:03,925
"You're family's gonna be evaporated
in an attack on the colonies,

545
00:31:04,025 --> 00:31:06,165
"but you'll survive for three more years

546
00:31:06,265 --> 00:31:08,561
"in a moldy compartment on a freighter,

547
00:31:08,661 --> 00:31:12,140
"till your body starts to
eat itself up alive."

548
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:16,080
Those are the gods that you worship?

549
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:19,330
Capricious, vindictive.

550
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:22,840
But they're not meant
to be taken literally.

551
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,075
They're metaphors, Emily.

552
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:27,800
I don't need metaphors.

553
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,650
I need answers.

554
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,355
You're like my mother.

555
00:31:32,455 --> 00:31:34,550
She wasn't satisfied
with metaphors either.

556
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:38,295
She was convinced that aphrodite herself
was gonna swoop her away when she died.

557
00:31:38,395 --> 00:31:39,700
And she believed it.

558
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:45,770
Even after the doloxan and the
radiation failed to stop her cancer.

559
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:46,970
She was a teacher.

560
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,590
She was a--

561
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:54,210
oh, she was something to behold in...
at the head of her classroom,

562
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:57,110
and her students...

563
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,195
Her students loved her, they...

564
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:04,035
they'd walk through fire for her.

565
00:32:04,135 --> 00:32:06,810
And then you see this woman who

566
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,990
seemed so...

567
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:15,440
eternal, she...

568
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,655
withered away,
and I find myself having

569
00:32:20,755 --> 00:32:24,440
to change her diaper
because she couldn't even--

570
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:28,955
And at the moment she died,

571
00:32:29,055 --> 00:32:32,085
there was no gleaming fields of
elysium stretched out before her.

572
00:32:32,185 --> 00:32:34,065
There was this...

573
00:32:34,165 --> 00:32:35,770
dark,

574
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:39,470
black abyss.

575
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:46,500
And she was just terrified.

576
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:50,250
She was so scared.

577
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,480
I'm sorry.

578
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,590
Laura.

579
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:07,085
Laura, you were terrified.

580
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:09,840
You saw only darkness.

581
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:16,130
You can't possibly know
what your mother experienced.

582
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,400
You're...you're still searching.

583
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,770
You're...

584
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,850
Doc Cottle! Doc!

585
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:26,630
Do something!

586
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:29,030
Nurse, get me some morpha quickly.

587
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,710
Shh, it's okay.

588
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,540
It's all right.

589
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,495
All we can do for her now is

590
00:33:49,595 --> 00:33:51,800
trying to make her comfortable.

591
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:54,800
That's all?

592
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,920
I'm sorry, that's it.

593
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,660
All right.

594
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:21,300
It's as if she doesn't
even see us anymore.

595
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,510
She's looking past us.

596
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:28,280
I've seen that look many times,
but never in the eyes of a Cylon.

597
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,500
Athena.

598
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:33,370
You were right.

599
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,030
Forgive me.

600
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:10,860
It's okay.

601
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,520
I'm with you.

602
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,840
She will lead us to the end.

603
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,500
We will now know the
truth of the opera house.

604
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,600
The home of the 13th.

605
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,010
What?

606
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:54,265
The Hybrid said,
"the missing three"

607
00:35:54,365 --> 00:35:58,670
"will give you the five who have come
from the home of the 13th."

608
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:02,020
The home of the 13th tribe of humans...

609
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:08,490
and the five is your
final five Cylon models.

610
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:10,685
And if they've come from the
home of the 13th tribe,

611
00:36:10,785 --> 00:36:12,535
then they must know the way back.

612
00:36:12,635 --> 00:36:14,730
They know how to get to Earth.

613
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:18,264
And the missing three is
the model you boxed...

614
00:36:18,364 --> 00:36:19,845
for looking at the faces of the Five.

615
00:36:19,945 --> 00:36:21,650
D'Anna.

616
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,260
She can recognize 'em.

617
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:29,000
Let's go.

618
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,910
Demetrius is waiting for us.

619
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:06,520
We're here.

620
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,680
Mother.

621
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,010
You're okay.

622
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,960
I'm not ready.

623
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:21,620
<i>...you will no longer need
to fear the unknown...</i>

624
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:26,407
<i>...because he will
take your hand...</i>

625
00:38:28,007 --> 00:38:31,120
<i>...and guide you to the other
side of the river...</i>

626
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,350
<i>...what river am I talking about?</i>

627
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:38,762
<i>...I'm talking about
the river that separates...</i>

628
00:38:38,912 --> 00:38:40,690
<i>...this world from the next...</i>

629
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:48,855
<i>There is more to reality than the
things that we can touch, taste,</i>

630
00:38:48,955 --> 00:38:51,850
<i>or even see with our naked eyes.</i>

631
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:54,700
<i>There is another realm.</i>

632
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,205
All hands to jump stations.

633
00:39:02,305 --> 00:39:03,750
Prepare to jump the ship.

634
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,035
All hands to jump stations.

635
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:06,120
Prepare to jump the ship.

636
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,295
<i>All hands to jump stations.</i>

637
00:39:07,395 --> 00:39:08,770
<i>Prepare to jump the ship.</i>

638
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:22,700
Come on.

639
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,570
Come on, come on!

640
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:40,840
Sublight.

641
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,450
Go.

642
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,185
Helm.

643
00:39:44,285 --> 00:39:44,755
Go.

644
00:39:44,855 --> 00:39:45,520
Nav.

645
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:46,270
Go.

646
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:47,145
Tactical.

647
00:39:47,245 --> 00:39:47,755
Go.

648
00:39:47,855 --> 00:39:50,190
Jump solution checks. Nav is go.

649
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,265
FTL.

650
00:39:56,365 --> 00:39:59,490
Drive's spun up 100% and stable, go.

651
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,590
The board is green.

652
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:21,110
She's gone.

653
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,060
Or they'd be back by now.

654
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:26,800
Execute jump in five,

655
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:28,380
four,

656
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:29,900
three,

657
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,325
DRADIS contact!

658
00:40:35,425 --> 00:40:36,405
Cylon baseship.

659
00:40:36,505 --> 00:40:37,310
It's right on top of us.

660
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:38,085
Hold the count!

661
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,620
Hold the count!

662
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,005
Baseship is squawking colonial I.D.

663
00:40:42,105 --> 00:40:44,380
I've got a comm signal,
but it's really weak.

664
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,800
Speakers!

665
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:49,160
<i>Demetrius, Athena.</i>

666
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,880
<i>Demetrius, Athena.</i>

667
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:56,205
Gods, it's good to hear your voice.

668
00:40:56,305 --> 00:40:57,930
Copy that, Helo.

669
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:00,040
The baseship is ours.

670
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:02,230
Mission accomplished.

671
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:04,150
Then let's go home.

672
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,045
I need to talk to you.

673
00:41:18,145 --> 00:41:19,445
Certainly. Come in.

674
00:41:19,545 --> 00:41:20,760
Thank you.

675
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,940
- Can I get you some water?
- Yes.

676
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,145
You really believe
that there's something

677
00:41:27,245 --> 00:41:32,200
in this horse manure
that Baltar's peddling?

678
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,920
I don't know.

679
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,884
Something is happening here,

680
00:41:35,984 --> 00:41:38,320
and I don't really
understand it, Bill.

681
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:44,110
That you both had
the same dream, means...

682
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:49,290
What?

683
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:51,250
Talk to me. What's going on?

684
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:59,070
Kara comes back from the dead.

685
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:04,480
I let her go off chasing
her vision of Earth.

686
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:07,070
Well, she's overdue.

687
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,995
Lee turns in his wings.

688
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:14,730
And Helo, Athena, Gaeta.

689
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:17,690
Will I ever see those kids again?

690
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:25,500
Bill.

691
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,100
Look at me.

692
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,690
I'm right here.

693
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,620
Right here.

694
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:36,420
We're going to find it.

695
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:38,960
Earth?

696
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:40,690
Together.

697
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,940
I used to think it
was such a pipe dream.

698
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:47,900
I used to use it as a
carrot for the fleet.

699
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,190
What made you change?

700
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:53,830
You.

701
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,800
You made me believe.
