1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,200
TWELVE CYLON MODELS

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,390
SEVEN ARE KNOWN

3
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:14,500
FOUR LIVE IN SECRET

4
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,840
ONE WILL BE REVEALED

5
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,570
Previously on Battlestar Galactica:

6
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,360
Helo handpicked a crew for you.

7
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,920
I'm giving you a ship.

8
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,510
We liberated the Demetrius.

9
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,450
A sewage recycling ship.

10
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:31,755
Now go.

11
00:00:31,855 --> 00:00:33,465
Find a way to Earth.

12
00:00:33,565 --> 00:00:36,300
I'm telling you, guys,
this thing is a setup anyway.

13
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:37,757
I mean, you think that the old man just

14
00:00:37,857 --> 00:00:39,275
gave her the ship and then cut her loose?

15
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:42,055
Hey, that's enough of that crap.

16
00:00:42,155 --> 00:00:44,205
The resurrection ship didn't make the jump.

17
00:00:44,305 --> 00:00:46,302
And now Cavil's baseships are breaking formation,

18
00:00:46,402 --> 00:00:47,940
taking positions around our periphery.

19
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,490
They're going to attack.

20
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,220
They've taken out our FTL!

21
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,685
No resurrection ship.

22
00:00:52,785 --> 00:00:54,095
They're really trying to kill us.

23
00:00:54,195 --> 00:00:56,130
Stay the frak away from me!

24
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:57,110
I heard you.

25
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:57,980
You're Cylons!

26
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,260
A bunch of frakkin' skinjobs.

27
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,885
You think Cally killed herself
because of you, don't you?

28
00:01:11,985 --> 00:01:13,930
She thought we were
having an affair.

29
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:14,665
But we weren't.

30
00:01:14,765 --> 00:01:15,775
No, that's right.

31
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,910
I'm not a cheater,
I'm a Cylon.

32
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,015
I'm not a priest,

33
00:01:20,115 --> 00:01:21,880
but that doesn't matter, you see.

34
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:26,345
Something in the universe loves me.

35
00:01:26,445 --> 00:01:28,446
God only loves that
which is perfect,

36
00:01:28,596 --> 00:01:29,640
and he loves you.

37
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,634
He loves you because you are perfect

38
00:01:32,784 --> 00:01:34,270
just as you are.

39
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,070
Demetrius
Mission: Find Earth

40
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,570
Day 58

41
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,780
Captain.

42
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,220
Captain!

43
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,805
I'm glad you're here.
I might have found something.

44
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:22,860
Before that, we need to talk about
making our rendezvous with the fleet.

45
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,450
Later.

46
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,415
No, no.

47
00:02:30,515 --> 00:02:32,730
No. Come on.

48
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,425
Here.

49
00:02:34,525 --> 00:02:35,700
What do you think?

50
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,750
Well.

51
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,930
It's hard to say.

52
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:47,000
Spectroscopics are promising.

53
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:51,380
But according to this, we already did
two long-range recons in that grid.

54
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,290
Both no joy.

55
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,030
Third time's the charm maybe.

56
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,200
All right,

57
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,080
I'll have Sharon prep to go as soon
as Anders gets back from his scout.

58
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,980
Hey.

59
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,915
What about you?

60
00:03:26,015 --> 00:03:27,780
You been getting any sleep?

61
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,730
I don't know.
Not...not much.

62
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,460
It was so clear when I first got back.

63
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,715
If I could...

64
00:03:37,815 --> 00:03:39,660
if I could just focus,

65
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,260
I know that I can find
that sound again.

66
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,710
I gotta go see the CAP off.
(Combat Air Patrol)

67
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,100
We'll talk when I get back.

68
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,070
Hold up.

69
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,170
I think I'll go with you
on this one.

70
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,355
You haven't flown CAPs
since we left the fleet.

71
00:04:10,455 --> 00:04:13,090
I think I'll go with you on this one.

72
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:34,260
I need you to tell me that
all this somehow makes sense.

73
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,990
This was my husband, James.

74
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,895
My two children, Danya and Reece.

75
00:04:39,995 --> 00:04:43,840
They were on Picon
when the Cylons attacked.

76
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,960
What do you feel when you
look at this photograph?

77
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,605
I feel rage.

78
00:04:52,705 --> 00:04:53,960
Against the Cylons.

79
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,400
Not just the machines,

80
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,455
anyone involved.

81
00:04:58,555 --> 00:05:01,280
The engineers who designed them.

82
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,245
The corporations,

83
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:08,980
the politicians who provoked this war
and then did nothing to protect us.

84
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,770
And most of all the gods.

85
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,030
The gods.

86
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,265
They stood by and let it all happen.

87
00:05:15,365 --> 00:05:16,970
Yes, I know.

88
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,200
I know.

89
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,630
I am so sorry, Phoebe.

90
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:39,670
I sympathize.

91
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,370
Unfortunately, the gods
cannot be blamed

92
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,330
for not coming to your aid.

93
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,060
It's not because they
weren't listening.

94
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,730
It's because they don't exist.

95
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,880
The gods we've been praying to for
thousands of years do not exist.

96
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:19,060
They can't help you
because they are not real.

97
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:26,190
We have been pandering to our own
ignorance for far too long.

98
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:34,350
Now on my own journey I've
been wronged, persecuted.

99
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,628
I prayed to the gods

100
00:06:38,878 --> 00:06:41,505
on my knees,
begging them for mercy.

101
00:06:42,405 --> 00:06:44,375
Tortured.

102
00:06:44,475 --> 00:06:46,410
I received nothing in resp--

103
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:00,320
I could've lived in that
abyss of bitterness,

104
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,115
but that will destroy you
like nothing else.

105
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:05,280
But I chose to forgive.

106
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,980
And most importantly,
I began with myself.

107
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,280
"Third time's the charm?"

108
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,860
And you just went along with it?

109
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:25,320
It's called
"following orders", Lieutenant.

110
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,220
It's called
"dragging our feet".

111
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:32,240
Starbuck's pushing our go back
deadline to the last second

112
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,285
'cause she's afraid
of what Adama's gonna say

113
00:07:34,385 --> 00:07:37,640
when he realizes her vision
was just a pipe dream.

114
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,335
You've got to be kidding me.

115
00:07:43,435 --> 00:07:44,795
She's taking a viper out now?

116
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,200
She can't be serious.

117
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,925
Maybe she could do a little finger painting...

118
00:07:48,025 --> 00:07:50,710
I've heard enough bitching
and moaning to last a lifetime.

119
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:53,035
Two more days and we're
back with the fleet, okay?

120
00:07:53,135 --> 00:07:56,350
Until then, everyone just
shut up and do your jobs.

121
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,165
Come on.

122
00:08:21,265 --> 00:08:22,960
Come on.

123
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,310
Come on.

124
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,320
Starbuck, Hot Dog.

125
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,085
Didn't catch that.

126
00:08:30,185 --> 00:08:31,390
What are your orders?

127
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,075
Hot dog, Demetrius.

128
00:08:33,175 --> 00:08:33,745
You know the drill.

129
00:08:33,845 --> 00:08:36,895
Keep your eyes open and stick
close to Starbuck's wing.

130
00:08:36,995 --> 00:08:39,590
I know you're out here somewhere.

131
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:41,610
Come on.

132
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,605
Starbuck, Dradis contact.

133
00:08:47,705 --> 00:08:49,410
Demetrius, we've got an inbound.

134
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,910
One bogey bearing 1-4-9er.

135
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:52,855
Roger that.

136
00:08:52,955 --> 00:08:53,810
Call action stations.

137
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,065
Spool up the FTL for emergency jump.

138
00:08:56,165 --> 00:08:57,825
Action stations, action stations.

139
00:08:57,925 --> 00:08:59,370
Set condition one throughout the ship.

140
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,310
This is not a drill.

141
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,970
Repeat, action stations,
action stations.

142
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,080
This is not a drill.

143
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,630
Son of a bitch, I knew it.

144
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:14,610
Demetrius, Hot Dog.

145
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,525
I've got visual.

146
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,240
Cylon heavy raider.

147
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,165
Starbuck, Demetrius.

148
00:09:18,265 --> 00:09:19,610
Report.

149
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,080
Report!

150
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:32,690
Demetrius, I'm seeing blast
damage all over this thing.

151
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,170
Starbuck, what are your orders?

152
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,225
Come on.

153
00:09:38,325 --> 00:09:41,010
Talk to me, shoot me,
do something.

154
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,560
Starbuck, what are your orders?

155
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,240
Kara.

156
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,740
I'm alone.

157
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,720
It's not an attack.

158
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,470
I knew I'd find you.

159
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,960
Knew you'd be out here searching.

160
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,380
Leoben?

161
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:14,410
I'm here for you, to offer a truce
between Cylon and Human,

162
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,950
and a chance for you
to complete your journey.

39,676 SURVIVORS

166
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,780
IN SEARCH OF A HOME

167
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:59,010
CALLED EARTH

169
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,265
Heavy raider's docked at the aft airlock.

170
00:11:18,365 --> 00:11:20,510
The animal part that
controls it looks dead.

171
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,160
We only found the one Leoben aboard.

172
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,460
Starbuck's still taking
one hell of a chance.

173
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,470
If he wanted to kill us,
we'd all be dead by now.

174
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,340
Just means he wants something else.

175
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,390
Kara.

176
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,520
Thank you for this.

177
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,705
We were praying for a miracle.

178
00:11:51,805 --> 00:11:53,550
It wasn't a miracle.

179
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,230
It's like I knew
you were out there.

180
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,175
I'm not picking up any
gamma emissions, sir.

181
00:11:57,275 --> 00:11:59,010
Raider's packing
conventional weaponry only.

182
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,200
No nukes.

183
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,490
All right.

184
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,530
Keep checking for tracking devices.

185
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,110
Anything that might
give up our position.

186
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,870
Don't look at me like that.

187
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:10,535
I'm sorry.

188
00:12:10,635 --> 00:12:13,035
The difference between the way
you were on New Caprica

189
00:12:13,135 --> 00:12:15,930
- and now is--
- I'm the same person.

190
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,210
I have eyes. I can see.

191
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:23,215
God has taken your hand and purged
you of the questions, the doubt.

192
00:12:23,315 --> 00:12:25,110
Your journey can finally begin.

193
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,300
But there isn't much time.

194
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,290
The others, the ones I left behind,
they need your help.

195
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,770
But not as much as you need theirs.

196
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,100
Why?

197
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,255
Your crew.

198
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:37,900
They don't trust you.

199
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,560
I need you to tell me why you're here...

200
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,945
Captain, we should move the prisoner.

201
00:12:42,045 --> 00:12:43,530
A blue planet...

202
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,835
- surrounded by clouds.
- You okay?

203
00:12:45,935 --> 00:12:47,090
Stop!

204
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,520
The hybrid.

205
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:04,325
When she first described it to me,
how beautiful it was, I cried.

206
00:13:04,425 --> 00:13:07,150
You need to go to her, Kara.

207
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,690
The hybrid, she'll tell you things.

208
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,715
Amazing things.

209
00:13:11,815 --> 00:13:12,955
We're done here.

210
00:13:13,055 --> 00:13:14,500
Get him out of here.

211
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,390
Wait!

212
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,280
Take him to my quarters.

213
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,150
Just do it!

214
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:26,850
Let's go.

215
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:57,890
It may never make any sense.

216
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:01,800
Hangar deck crew tells me you've
been obsessing over this place.

217
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,440
Going over the logs.

218
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,840
Replaying the accident
again and again.

219
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,410
Accident.

220
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,840
What is it?

221
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,750
I spoke to Cottle.

222
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:21,150
Cally was on moxopan and cosapine.

223
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,410
Antidepressants.

224
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:29,180
How did she go from
antidepressants to suicide?

225
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,235
Well, she was...

226
00:14:31,335 --> 00:14:34,140
emotionally disturbed.

227
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,350
She would've left me.

228
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,695
She never would've left Nicky behind.

229
00:14:40,795 --> 00:14:42,070
So...

230
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,530
what do you think then?

231
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:48,710
Someone killed her?

232
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,230
Galen, you have to let it go.

233
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,970
No, I gotta figure out what happened.

234
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,180
What if she knew?

235
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,505
How would she have known?

236
00:15:04,605 --> 00:15:06,255
Maybe she sensed it.

237
00:15:06,355 --> 00:15:08,275
I mean, she was your wife.

238
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:13,130
You've been different
since the nebula.

239
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,640
Maybe she was afraid of you.

240
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,650
Maybe it was God's will.

241
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,270
We don't know why
these things happen.

242
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,640
But God does.

243
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:27,490
And he has plan for us.

244
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:31,410
For whatever reason,
her death, our awakening,

245
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:34,035
you gotta trust that it's
all for the best.

246
00:15:34,135 --> 00:15:35,650
Why are you here?

247
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,950
Because we are in this together.

248
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:41,340
And I am here for you, Galen.

249
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,320
I know exactly where you are right now.

250
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,180
I have been there.

251
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:48,640
Until Gaius helped me realize that.

252
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,530
What?

253
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:55,226
Whatever has gone on before,
whatever I have done,

254
00:15:55,326 --> 00:15:57,000
it doesn't matter.

255
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,290
We can still change.

256
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,950
You spend way too much
time with Baltar.

257
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,330
So I guess I missed all the excitement, huh?

258
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:26,870
So what's the deal?

259
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:28,895
This Leoben, has he said anything?

260
00:16:28,995 --> 00:16:29,930
Don't know.

261
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:33,550
Starbuck ordered the guards
to wait outside, lose the cuffs.

262
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:36,650
Said she didn't want to be disturbed.

263
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,510
Guess I'll talk to her.

264
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:41,570
Yeah, why don't you do that?

265
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,360
Hey.

266
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,380
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

267
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,175
Get the hell away from her.

268
00:17:01,275 --> 00:17:02,960
Sam--Sam, stop it!

269
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,430
- What is wrong with you, Kara?
- Stop it!

270
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,940
- Reese, in here, now!
- I can see why she's so fond of you.

271
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,320
Just leave him alone.

272
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:13,580
You know--
you know what we have to do.

273
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:15,895
Just remember,
there isn't much time.

274
00:17:15,995 --> 00:17:17,550
Get him the frak out of here!

275
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,930
Cuff him and lock him in storage!

276
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,245
What is going on with you?

277
00:17:23,345 --> 00:17:24,750
Kara!

278
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,970
He can help us.

279
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:29,325
The Cylons,
they understand about Earth.

280
00:17:29,425 --> 00:17:30,785
And you believe him?

281
00:17:30,885 --> 00:17:33,010
After everything he's done to you?

282
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:36,540
Kara, he kept you locked up
for months on New Caprica.

283
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,540
The frakkin' mind games.

284
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,690
I swear to gods,
this is not a dream.

285
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,300
It's real.

286
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,280
I'm glad you're here.

287
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,690
You and Kara,
did you get things worked out?

288
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,805
Because you should.

289
00:18:06,905 --> 00:18:09,980
You weren't meant to be enemies.

290
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:10,970
No.

291
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,360
That'd be you and me.

292
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,370
What do you want from Kara?

293
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,380
The same thing I've always wanted.

294
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,260
For her to understand her destiny.

295
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,315
That's not good enough.

296
00:18:25,415 --> 00:18:27,340
It's good enough for her.

297
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:37,810
What is the most basic
article of faith?

298
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:42,650
That this is not all that we are.

299
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,560
C-bucks rule.

300
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,690
What did you just say?

301
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,605
Forward guard, right?

302
00:18:58,705 --> 00:18:59,705
I saw a couple of games.

303
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:00,875
You were good.

304
00:19:00,975 --> 00:19:04,355
Yet after all the celebrity
and acclaim, what were you?

305
00:19:04,455 --> 00:19:05,890
Just another face selling magazines.

306
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,163
Another piece of scoreboard trivia,

307
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,740
and you always knew you were destined for more.

308
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:14,180
You were just waiting for your
singular moment of clarity.

309
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,305
Well, maybe I just found it.

310
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:19,540
You kill me,
Kara's dream dies with me.

311
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:21,805
I don't think so.

312
00:19:21,905 --> 00:19:26,260
I think you download into another
Leoben body and you spew more lies.

313
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,190
No one's coming back.

314
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,545
We were lured out of resurrection range.

315
00:19:36,645 --> 00:19:37,755
Ship was attacked.

316
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,530
We survived.

317
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,355
The baseship was damaged.

318
00:19:40,455 --> 00:19:42,130
We were set adrift.

319
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,410
What are you talking about?

320
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,150
Who attacked you?

321
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,380
War has broken out between the Cylon.

322
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,320
Battle lines have been drawn

323
00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:02,180
between those who embrace their
nature and those who fear it.

324
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,430
Good.

325
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,490
You can blow yourselves
to hell for all I care.

326
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,825
That's one way,
that's one way.

327
00:20:08,925 --> 00:20:10,130
There's another.

328
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,800
An alliance.

329
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,200
Allow our paths to converge.

330
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:19,760
You save us from our
savage brothers,

331
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:25,535
and our Old One, the hybrid,
will show Kara the righteous path.

332
00:20:25,635 --> 00:20:29,725
And together, they'll lead us
to the promised land.

333
00:20:29,825 --> 00:20:33,160
Together, we will find Earth.

334
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,725
He said his baseship was attacked;

335
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:45,170
that they were ambushed
by their own kind.

336
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:48,450
So now the Cylons want us
to rescue them.

337
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:49,470
That's novel.

338
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:54,385
Well, he's proposing an alliance
between us and his damaged baseship.

339
00:20:54,485 --> 00:20:55,800
How's that supposed to work?

340
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,405
Yeah, are supposed to leave
them piggyback on our nav

341
00:20:58,505 --> 00:21:01,750
and FTL systems and help
them jump out of harm's way?

342
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,555
They'll join forces with the fleet.

343
00:21:03,655 --> 00:21:05,060
Right.

344
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,440
If it's true.

345
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,630
Frak.

346
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,390
Are you actually thinking
about doing this?

347
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:11,470
XO, listen.

348
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,540
Bringing Leoben on board,
that was questionable at best.

349
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,940
But jumping back to his baseship?

350
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:16,850
It's suicide.

351
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,720
Nothing's been decided.

352
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,750
And would you trust Starbuck to
make the right decision?

353
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:22,720
Because she's out of control.

354
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,440
Whoa, what are you saying?

355
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,650
We are running on fumes, Anders.

356
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:30,820
In two days we are gonna be overdue
for our rendezvous with the fleet.

357
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,640
We gotta do something before
she takes us all down with her.

358
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,810
Are you talking mutiny?

359
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,360
'Cause that's sure what it sounds like.

360
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,145
You want to tear this ship apart,

361
00:21:43,245 --> 00:21:46,065
then keep riling up the crew
making your crazy Starbuck cracks.

362
00:21:46,165 --> 00:21:48,450
Otherwise, I suggest
you both shut the frak up.

363
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,250
Starbuck is leading us into a trap.

364
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,020
Cylons are gonna capture
the freighter.

365
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:57,455
They're gonna have nav data leading
straight back to the fleet.

366
00:21:57,555 --> 00:21:59,630
Then we better keep that
from happening.

367
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:04,780
Order the CAP back
and lock down the ship.

368
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,470
As soon we can work through the jump
coordinates from Leoben's raider, we go.

369
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,760
It's a chance to find Earth!

370
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,420
I intend to take it.

371
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:30,760
Not that I particularly care,

372
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,700
but since I haven't been
arrested recently or beaten up,

373
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:37,190
can I...can I surmise that the President

374
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:40,390
has not been apprised
of my pirate broadcasts?

375
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,160
Actually,
I told her all about them.

376
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:50,840
I even suggested that
she'd speak to the Admiral.

377
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,350
Really.

378
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,310
I guess you'll have to do
something about that.

379
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,270
Or not.

380
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:11,380
Even Roslin and Adama must realize the
movement's taken on a life of its own.

381
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:16,105
It's gonna take them more than
bashing in a few heads to stop this.

382
00:23:16,205 --> 00:23:20,180
The truth is you're not worth another
confrontation in the quorum.

383
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:24,770
You're maybe drawing more bodies
to your crusade,

384
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,895
but they're from the fringes.

385
00:23:26,995 --> 00:23:29,580
No one of consequence.

386
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,010
Get some clothes on.

387
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,090
They're waiting for you.

388
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,745
Think we have enough?

389
00:23:36,845 --> 00:23:37,410
It doesn't matter.

390
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,980
They're not coming to be fed.

391
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,920
They're coming to hear
Dr. Baltar's word,

392
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,980
and learn from it,
just like we did.

393
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:58,480
The past is written.

394
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,880
Impossible to change.

395
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:09,180
Why are so many of us
living in the past?

396
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:14,770
Living with the shame
of what we have done.

397
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:21,160
When we could live
in awe of what we might do.

398
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:23,450
What we might do.

399
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,700
What will we do?

400
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,265
Spiral endlessly through the heavens

401
00:24:30,365 --> 00:24:34,020
until humanity itself comes to a close?

402
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:39,330
Or do we look inward...

403
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:43,030
and find that strength within?

404
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:47,220
Can you believe these people are
actually buying into Baltar's crap?

405
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,750
We need to talk.

406
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:53,155
I don't have anything
to say to you.

407
00:24:53,255 --> 00:24:54,575
Well, then you can listen.

408
00:24:54,675 --> 00:24:55,780
Come with me.

409
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:00,370
<i>Community. Live. Love.</i>

410
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:03,740
I've been cutting you some slack
because of Cally, but that's over.

411
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,780
You gotta pull yourself together now.

412
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,420
Suck it up.

413
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,680
Just like you, huh?

414
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,850
Now what is that supposed to mean?

415
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:19,110
I hear you've been spending some
time in the lockup with the Six.

416
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:21,630
Remember when this all started?

417
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:24,050
You said nothing would change you
from the man you want to be.

418
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,770
Well, how about it, Colonel?

419
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:28,600
You still the same old Saul Tigh?

420
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,630
Anything I've done I can live with.

421
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,940
Well, that's the difference
between you and me.

422
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,080
I can't.

423
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,098
Tory's got it in her head
that we can be

424
00:25:43,248 --> 00:25:45,185
the salvation of the human race.

425
00:25:45,985 --> 00:25:48,140
All I know is if there is a God,

426
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,770
he's laughing his ass off.

427
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,600
EVA is almost complete, captain.

428
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,325
Demetrius, Mathias.

429
00:26:05,425 --> 00:26:08,160
I've finished inspection of the aft section.

430
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,580
She's a big sucker.

431
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:12,480
Okay, wrap it up, Sarge.

432
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,450
Get back to nest asap.

433
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,200
Roger that, Athena.

434
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,900
I was getting bored
with the view anyhow.

435
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,840
Hold up.

436
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:28,325
Got a leak.

437
00:26:28,425 --> 00:26:32,815
Some kind of gas venting
through a crack in the hull.

438
00:26:32,915 --> 00:26:34,760
Something's happening.

439
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,580
Mathias, report.

440
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:55,110
Mathias, report!

441
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:37,810
Please...
Please don't clap.

442
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,200
What are you all doing here?

443
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:54,740
The reason that we are all here

444
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:58,240
is 'cause the old ways
have failed us.

445
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:02,275
It doesn't matter if you're
a believer or a nonbeliever.

446
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:04,940
It certainly makes
no difference to me.

447
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,990
You are all welcome.

448
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,210
Mr. Tyrol.

449
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,100
Mr. Tyrol.

450
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:22,640
I know that we have had
our differences,

451
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,060
but I am begging you right now
to set those aside.

452
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:32,440
Come down here
and take my hand.

453
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:39,240
If not for yourself,
then for your wife.

454
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,260
For Cally.

455
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,640
She would've wanted this.

456
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,760
Cally wasn't like me.

457
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:02,170
She forgave you for New Caprica.

458
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:05,490
Even read your bogus manifesto,
but not me.

459
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:07,520
You may have your sheep fooled.

460
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:10,720
They may be buying into your
message of forgiveness.

461
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,980
But let me tell you:

462
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:18,450
There are some sins that even your
imaginary God can never forgive.

463
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:22,635
I have not been talking
about an imaginary god.

464
00:29:22,735 --> 00:29:26,150
I am asking you
to take my hand.

465
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,950
Take my hand, Mr. Tyrol.

466
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,710
For Cally.

467
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,900
It's what she would've wanted.

468
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:51,565
Get off of him!

469
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:52,680
Leave him!

470
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,310
Leave him!

471
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,770
You didn't know her!

472
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:12,680
I heard an explosion.
Are you all right?

473
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:15,540
What'd you do?

474
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,945
Blow the Tylium stores?

475
00:31:17,045 --> 00:31:18,385
That's the Kara I used to know.

476
00:31:18,485 --> 00:31:21,080
The raider's in pieces,
you mother-frakker!

477
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:24,230
Sergeant Mathias is dead.

478
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,400
Not that you give a damn!

479
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,295
You can't think that
I had anything to do with that.

480
00:31:31,395 --> 00:31:33,530
I wasn't even on the deck.

481
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:37,895
I was too busy believing you
instead of watching out for my crew.

482
00:31:37,995 --> 00:31:39,470
My ship was under fire.

483
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,765
The reactor could've been damaged.

484
00:31:41,865 --> 00:31:43,185
It was a setup.

485
00:31:43,285 --> 00:31:44,400
Say it!

486
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,685
Hit me, hit me again.

487
00:31:47,785 --> 00:31:50,705
You used me to get close to the ship.

488
00:31:50,805 --> 00:31:52,815
How many times did you
kill me on New Caprica?

489
00:31:52,915 --> 00:31:53,685
Don't stop now.

490
00:31:53,785 --> 00:31:55,600
- Frak you!
- Go on, do it.

491
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,450
I won't come back this time,
I promise.

492
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,755
Resurrection ship's
well out of range.

493
00:31:59,855 --> 00:32:01,030
Go on, do it.

494
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,370
Do it!

495
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,890
It doesn't help.

496
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,600
Does it?

497
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:21,150
Nothing feels quite
like it did before.

498
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,870
Does it?

499
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:30,090
What are you doing to me?

500
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,870
All of your life...

501
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:44,030
you forced back the truth by
lashing out at everyone around you.

502
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:46,800
Anesthetizing yourself with
ambrosia and empty affairs.

503
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:50,650
But you've lost the taste
for those petty things.

504
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,295
I'm the same person.

505
00:32:52,395 --> 00:32:53,745
No, there's a void,

506
00:32:53,845 --> 00:32:57,040
an emptiness that can only be filled by
taking the next step on your journey.

507
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,850
What happened to me
the two months I was missing?

508
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,065
I don't know.

509
00:33:02,165 --> 00:33:04,870
The mandala,
the paintings, my mother.

510
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,835
It had to mean something.

511
00:33:06,935 --> 00:33:09,180
You have to make peace
with your past.

512
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,335
Why?

513
00:33:12,435 --> 00:33:14,030
Because that part of you is gone.

514
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:17,825
I told you when I first came aboard
this ship that you had changed.

515
00:33:17,925 --> 00:33:19,635
I look at you now,
I don't see Kara Thrace.

516
00:33:19,935 --> 00:33:21,060
I see...

517
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:24,000
an angel,
blazing with the light of God.

518
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:27,440
An angel,
eager to lead her people home.

519
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,265
This is bad.

520
00:33:32,365 --> 00:33:33,920
This is really bad.

521
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,470
She can't explain
this one away.

522
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:37,450
So you think
she's a Cylon now?

523
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:41,595
Starbuck's racked up more kills
than any pilot in the fleet.

524
00:33:41,695 --> 00:33:43,120
Yeah, Starbuck maybe.

525
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,448
Okay, but who the hell knows

526
00:33:45,548 --> 00:33:47,670
who got off that viper
two months ago?

527
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,450
I'm not really very good
at any of this.

528
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,800
We've all come to remember
Sergeant Erin Mathias,

529
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:12,990
to grieve for our loss,

530
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,860
to honor her.

531
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:19,550
Mathias is dead
because of me.

532
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,655
We've all heard the words,
the prayers,

533
00:34:21,755 --> 00:34:23,840
but I don't know
what any of it means anymore.

534
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:26,750
We want to believe
that she died for something.

535
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:32,035
But in this war,
people die and it is just stupid.

536
00:34:32,135 --> 00:34:34,370
It's an accident.
There's no nobility to it.

537
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:37,315
There's nothing we can grab onto
that's gonna make it any easier.

538
00:34:37,415 --> 00:34:39,420
They're just gone.

539
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,100
I have to live with that.

540
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,680
You know, I know...

541
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:53,600
that this has been
a difficult mission, and...

542
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,060
maybe I haven't...

543
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,020
Captain, we've downloaded the
rendezvous coordinates to the FTL.

544
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,590
We're ready to jump back to
the fleet on your order.

545
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,040
We're not going back
to the fleet.

546
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,335
What the hell
are you talking about?

547
00:35:24,435 --> 00:35:25,855
We came out here
to complete a mission.

548
00:35:25,955 --> 00:35:28,380
That baseship has something
to do with it, I know it.

549
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,070
Captain Agathon.

550
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,435
Lock down the ship.

551
00:35:32,535 --> 00:35:33,790
Prepare to jump.

552
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:39,265
No, you know what?

553
00:35:39,365 --> 00:35:40,840
Frak her and frak her
little pet Cylon, okay?

554
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:41,922
Pike...
Pike!

555
00:35:42,072 --> 00:35:43,665
This baseship was never
part of the mission.

556
00:35:43,765 --> 00:35:46,247
Okay, one of us is dead now.
One of us is dead,

557
00:35:46,347 --> 00:35:49,950
and if we don't leave right now
we are all going to die, all right?

558
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,315
Let it go...
just let it go, Pike!

559
00:35:51,615 --> 00:35:52,457
Everybody stand down!

560
00:35:52,557 --> 00:35:54,290
If I don't do anything,
we're all gonna die!

561
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:55,025
Get out of my way.

562
00:35:55,125 --> 00:35:56,265
You have your orders, Pike.
Now back off.

563
00:35:56,365 --> 00:35:58,695
You better choose
which side you're on, Captain.

564
00:35:58,795 --> 00:35:59,760
Walk away.

565
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,985
Walk away and this
doesn't go any further!

566
00:36:02,085 --> 00:36:04,970
Oh yeah, now you'll be the one
to protect that Cylon thing, right?

567
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,565
Gaius, I just don't understand what
you're trying to accomplish.

568
00:36:39,665 --> 00:36:41,765
- I mean, this man is psychotic.
- My message is for everyone.

569
00:36:41,865 --> 00:36:42,885
Especially for the ones who don't want to listen.

570
00:36:42,985 --> 00:36:45,080
- I just don't think it's safe.
- Five minutes, that's all.

571
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,280
Mr. Tyrol.

572
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:59,135
- Gaius, I really don't think--
- There's nothing to be afraid of.

573
00:36:59,235 --> 00:37:00,790
Be careful.

574
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,490
Look, uh, Chief, I...

575
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,840
I'm here to ask
for your forgiveness.

576
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,810
About my presumption earlier.

577
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,400
You were right, you know.

578
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:35,430
I hardly knew your wife.

579
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:37,560
I'm sorry.

580
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:45,320
Would you mind if I...?

581
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,690
just, um...

582
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:59,580
I know it's hard to...

583
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:03,000
make sense of things sometimes.

584
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,090
In my own life...

585
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:10,125
In my own life,
I joined the fleet as a scientist,

586
00:38:10,225 --> 00:38:13,290
as a skeptic,
as supposedly a man of reason.

587
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:22,170
Only to have fate
turn that all on its head,

588
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,290
but I understand now that
there is a purpose to it.

589
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,380
We change.

590
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,620
We evolve.

591
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,260
Maybe we even learn something
along the way.

592
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,410
I have committed...

593
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,640
unconscionable crimes...

594
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,620
and I have been offered
one last chance at redemption.

595
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,970
Because I chose to accept my fate,

596
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,080
not fight it anymore.

597
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,070
I'm so sorry
for your loss, Chief.

598
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,405
She was a very beautiful woman,
your wife.

599
00:39:26,505 --> 00:39:28,320
I'm also told,
quite spiritual.

600
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:32,220
You know, I don't expect you
to believe me, but...

601
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:37,060
I would very much like
to have known her better.

602
00:39:58,090 --> 00:39:59,850
Thank you.

603
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,355
Action stations,
action stations.

604
00:40:10,455 --> 00:40:12,870
Set Condition One
throughout the ship.

605
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:15,100
Are you really gonna do this?

606
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,590
I don't have any choice.

607
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:24,530
Yes, you do.

608
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,880
FTL's spooled, Captain.

609
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:35,580
Good.

610
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,250
Set the clock.

611
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:40,940
Captain.

612
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:44,780
Captain,
I'm asking you to reconsider.

613
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,370
There's not enough time.

614
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,600
We don't go now,
we lose our shot.

615
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:50,725
That's assuming
we believe the Cylon.

616
00:40:50,825 --> 00:40:51,679
That's assuming we believe

617
00:40:51,779 --> 00:40:52,935
that Leoben's coordinates are right.

618
00:40:53,035 --> 00:40:55,345
We don't jump into a nest of baseships
or the middle of a star...

619
00:40:55,445 --> 00:40:58,000
Galactica's standing orders are clear.

620
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:01,485
If we miss the rendezvous,
Adama will assume we're dead or captured.

621
00:41:01,585 --> 00:41:02,395
They will leave us.

622
00:41:02,495 --> 00:41:04,490
No. Not Adama.

623
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,125
Listen to me,
we can jump back to Galactica.

624
00:41:07,225 --> 00:41:09,255
Okay, if the Admiral's for it,
we can re-supply,

625
00:41:09,355 --> 00:41:10,920
send out an armed patrol.

626
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:15,270
Do not do this, Helo.

627
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:26,760
I can't allow you to risk
the lives of this ship's crew.

628
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:30,565
When the admiral put me in command,
he told me to trust my instincts.

629
00:41:30,665 --> 00:41:32,255
Find the next marker,
see if it checks out.

630
00:41:32,355 --> 00:41:35,640
Lead the people
from the fleet home.

631
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:37,645
That is what I intend to do.

632
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:40,000
Now,
prepare to jump!

633
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:46,950
I'm sorry, sir,
but I cannot obey that order.

634
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:57,670
Then you are relieved,
Captain.

635
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:14,170
Mr. Gaeta,
you are now the new XO.

636
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,280
Prepare to jump on my mark.

637
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:20,230
No, sir.

638
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:24,470
Okay, everybody needs to think about
what they're doing here.

639
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,460
They have thought about it, Sam.

640
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,630
They all have.

641
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,960
It's a mutiny.

642
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:45,320
Captain Thrace,
as XO of the Demetrius,

643
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,990
and acting under article ten of
the colonial military code,

644
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:54,540
I'm hereby
relieving you of command.
