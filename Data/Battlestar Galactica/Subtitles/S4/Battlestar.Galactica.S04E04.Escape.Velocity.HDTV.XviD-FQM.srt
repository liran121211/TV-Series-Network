00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,770
TWELVE CYLON MODELS

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:08,000
SEVEN ARE KNOWN

3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:14,140
FOUR LIVE IN SECRET

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,670
ONE WILL BE REVEALED

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,820
Previously on Battlestar Galactica:

6
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,960
You'll be safe here, Gaius.

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,285
Please, God, don't let this child die.

8
00:00:29,385 --> 00:00:30,285
God answered your prayers.

9
00:00:30,385 --> 00:00:31,500
- You have to see.
- What?

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,385
Look at him.

11
00:00:32,485 --> 00:00:33,560
And no trace of a fever.

12
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,045
It's a miracle.

13
00:00:35,145 --> 00:00:36,545
Tory, Tory, Tory.

14
00:00:36,645 --> 00:00:38,750
Fancy finding you in the cafeteria.

15
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,150
You have an abundance of feeling.

16
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,425
I suppose I could be a Cylon.

17
00:00:43,525 --> 00:00:45,155
Cylons can feel.

18
00:00:45,255 --> 00:00:46,140
Do you believe that?

19
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,540
Yeah, I do actually.

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,875
I want to explain.

21
00:00:48,975 --> 00:00:50,355
She sought us out.

22
00:00:50,455 --> 00:00:52,550
You know what has to be done here.

23
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,190
Now, it would be better for
her sake if it was you.

24
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:58,965
Let's say Cally does find out.

25
00:00:59,065 --> 00:00:59,930
What do we do then?

26
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,620
The last thing we need is for
your Cylon-hating wife

27
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,090
to find out there's a bunch of
skinjobs running around this ship,

28
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,320
and that her husband is one of them.

29
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,955
- Cally.
- Stay the frak away from me!

30
00:01:11,055 --> 00:01:11,985
I heard you.

31
00:01:12,085 --> 00:01:12,965
You're Cylons.

32
00:01:13,065 --> 00:01:15,140
A bunch of frakking skinjobs.

33
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,580
I couldn't keep you safe
from harm, my love,

34
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,950
but I kept you in my heart.

35
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:42,890
You were the breath in my lungs,
the blood in my veins,

36
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:49,800
the light in my eye,
and now that breath is gone.

37
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,610
That blood and the light are gone.

38
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,360
I am left, a voice.

39
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:16,970
And the lords of Kobol, as many
and as varied as mortal men,

40
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:27,210
must bend down and lean low to hear
that voice and hear my lament.

41
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:45,330
With all our thoughts and love,
Calandra Henderson Tyrol,

42
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,380
we send your spirit into the universe.

43
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,730
So say we all.

44
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,600
So say we all.

45
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:04,140
I like this service.

46
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,390
It's not for me, I'll tell you that.

47
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:12,440
I know, but I want you
to know what I like.

48
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,350
It was lovely.

49
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:23,935
Thank you.

50
00:03:24,035 --> 00:03:26,175
Why do they have to do
these things at dawn?

51
00:03:26,275 --> 00:03:27,280
It's all right.

52
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,240
They do because they have to.

53
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:32,910
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,060
Let me know if you need anything.

55
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,380
Thank you.

56
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,655
We're sorry about your loss.

57
00:03:48,755 --> 00:03:50,230
Sorry, chief.

58
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,480
What the frak was that?

59
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,770
He'll get us all killed.

60
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,130
Chief.

61
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,930
I'm--I'm so sorry.

62
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,180
What's it up to today?

63
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:21,290
Same as-- sleeping, pacing.

64
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,530
Don't know how it doesn't go nuts.

65
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,120
Probably turns its brain off.

66
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,810
Frakkin' toaster.

67
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,670
Yeah.

68
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,880
Colonel.

69
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:42,650
Your request to see the child,
Hera Agathon, has been denied.

70
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,854
And you felt the need
to come all the way...

71
00:04:44,954 --> 00:04:46,960
down here in person to
tell me that again?

72
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,520
You think I want to come down here?

73
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,070
We're done.

74
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,470
I think we're not.

75
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,270
You come every day,

76
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,910
but you never ask questions anymore.

77
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,120
Is there something
that you want from me?

78
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,550
Is there something that you need?

79
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,200
Stay back.

80
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,350
See you tomorrow, colonel.

81
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,450
Door!

82
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:36,410
What was that at the
service this morning?

83
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:39,790
Why don't you get on the wireless
and tell the fleet about us?

84
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,600
Are you going to deal with that kid?

85
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,010
Probably needs to be changed.

86
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,280
All right.

87
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,100
You think Cally killed herself
because of you, don't you?

88
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,800
She thought we were having an affair.

89
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,970
But we weren't.

90
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,150
I don't even know what I am anymore.

91
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,530
I don't know which of
my memories are real.

92
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:09,230
<i>- That's better...</i>

93
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:14,530
I don't know that I've had one action
in my life that isn't programmed.

94
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,630
Galen, you're perfect.

95
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,920
You don't need guilt.

96
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,200
We were made to be perfect.

97
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,680
What is that?

98
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,740
More of Baltar's crap?

99
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,590
So...

100
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,535
You just live without guilt?

101
00:06:34,635 --> 00:06:37,640
Just shut it down.

102
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,670
No, that wasn't the deal.

103
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,325
Colonel, you said it yourself.

104
00:06:44,425 --> 00:06:46,430
Be the man you want to
be till the day you die.

105
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,110
We're still the same people, aren't we?

106
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,070
Of course, we are.

107
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:49,785
You shut up.

108
00:06:49,885 --> 00:06:51,995
That is not the same as human.

109
00:06:52,095 --> 00:06:55,055
Like we're stronger, right?

110
00:06:55,155 --> 00:07:01,685
Chief, what you're feeling is what
a man feels when this happens.

111
00:07:01,785 --> 00:07:04,340
It's normal, and it's human.

112
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,360
And it's not gonna end anytime soon.

113
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,975
It'll be there every day.

114
00:07:12,075 --> 00:07:14,670
You'll see her every day.

115
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,970
You'll see her.

116
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,780
Be a man, chief.

117
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,490
Feel what you gotta feel.

118
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,460
But don't risk us.

119
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,330
Come on, Tory.

120
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,540
Just think about it.

121
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,960
Think about what we are.

122
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,500
What we can do.

Dear gods, what...?

130
00:08:55,685 --> 00:08:56,940
"Gods"?

131
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,595
Thought there was only one.

132
00:08:58,695 --> 00:09:00,110
What are you doing?

133
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,690
Pulling one hair from
your head at a time.

134
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,250
It's intense, isn't it?

135
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:06,940
Yeah.

136
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,950
If it happens at the same time
as a pleasurable touch...

137
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,035
Frak!

138
00:09:16,135 --> 00:09:18,900
- signals get crossed, don't they?
- Yeah.

139
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,420
It's hard to tell the
pleasure from the pain.

140
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,360
Yeah.

141
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,900
Okay, listen, I think that--

142
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,750
You're very strong, aren't you?

143
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:30,910
You're pretty...you're really...

144
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,325
I think I preferred it when you cried.

145
00:09:37,425 --> 00:09:43,115
If you assume that God forgives
you, then it's gone, right?

146
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:44,715
Erased?

147
00:09:44,815 --> 00:09:46,595
Forgiveness.

148
00:09:46,695 --> 00:09:48,670
You must consecrate the sin.

149
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,315
- Make it benign.
- Oh, yeah.

150
00:09:51,415 --> 00:09:53,835
- Bad becomes good.
- Oh, yes, it does.

151
00:09:53,935 --> 00:09:55,630
Pain becomes pleasure.

152
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,305
And doesn't that mean,

153
00:09:58,405 --> 00:10:02,870
if you really become one with God,
you can never do wrong?

154
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:08,450
No, not really, because that ….

155
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:14,130
That would more than imply
that we're all perfect.

156
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,470
- Perfect?
- Yeah.

157
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:29,210
- Perfect just as we are.
- No, no, no! No!

158
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,090
Go on, go, get out!

159
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,840
Where is Gaius Baltar?

160
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,160
He isn't here.

161
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,290
You, on your feet.

162
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,460
Find him.

163
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:09,985
Where is he?

164
00:11:10,085 --> 00:11:11,290
I don't know.

165
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,605

One minute! Go! Go! Go!

168
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,690
We're coming back for Gaius Baltar.

169
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:31,975
Frak!

170
00:11:32,075 --> 00:11:33,500
Finishing up, chief?

171
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,550
Yeah, just give me one more relay.

172
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,540
I think it's a boy.

173
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,180
Here you go, chief.

174
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,700
Nice to be small, huh?

175
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:54,655
Chief, we ready to go?

176
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,370
I gotta get out of here.

177
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,515
Yeah.

178
00:12:03,615 --> 00:12:04,980
Go ahead.

179
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,775
Raptor away. Readings nominal.

180
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,100
Racetrack, Redwing.

181
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,435
We been waiting for that
school bus of yours all day.

182
00:12:27,535 --> 00:12:28,790
School bus, huh?

183
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:31,340
What's that make those things?
Bicycles?

184
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,665
Racing cars, sweetheart.

185
00:12:33,765 --> 00:12:35,050
Top Fuel racers.

186
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:38,120
It's not gonna look very good when
they get beat by a school bus.

187
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,740
Okay, let's ride.

188
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,820
What the frak?
Frak!

189
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:54,060
Galactica, Racetrack. I have no control
in my port rear lower RCS thruster.

190
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,195
Skulls, get your ass up here.

191
00:12:57,295 --> 00:12:59,480
Galactica, Racetrack. Coming about.

192
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,580
Clear port landing deck
for emergency landing.

193
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:05,185
Racetrack, Galactica.
Emergency landing cleared.

194
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:10,140
One, two, three, four.

195
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,100
One, two, three.

196
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,890
Coming in hot.

197
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,220
Too hot!

198
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:30,590
Where's the admiral?

199
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:31,320
Where is he?

200
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,935
And what are you doing, taking notes,
standing here, Mr. Officious?

201
00:13:34,035 --> 00:13:35,380
You should be out there right now,

202
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,145
trying to find the people,
whoever they are!

203
00:13:37,245 --> 00:13:38,430
Whatever you say, sir.

204
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:41,530
You can read the old
text, can't you, Gaius?

205
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:45,160
Sons of Ar-is?

206
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,385
Ares. Sons of Ares.

207
00:13:46,485 --> 00:13:47,615
They're the people who
committed this attack.

208
00:13:47,715 --> 00:13:50,420
Obviously, a fundamentalist
splinter group.

209
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:58,335
Although, all they're doing is trying
to protect the old gods.

210
00:13:58,435 --> 00:14:00,710
Old gods die hard.

211
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,220
Even among your people.

212
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,770
I've seen you here before.

213
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,160
Your name is...
Don't tell me,

214
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,795
um, begins with "M".

215
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:25,010
- Lilly.
- Lilly.

216
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,760
What's in your hand, Lilly?

217
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,430
Asklepius.

218
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,090
The god of healing.

219
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,630
I know you'll heal our people.

220
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,330
But I thought...

221
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,780
The old gods are fighting back.

222
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,650
Those capacitors are still hot.

223
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,890
Watch yourself, chief.

224
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,970
Take my glove.

225
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,770
Frak me.

226
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,010
My fault, didn't get swapped out.

227
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,105
Yeah, we could have died.

228
00:15:29,205 --> 00:15:32,050
- Was that in your pocket?
- We don't have to do this.

229
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:35,560
You're right, we're okay.

230
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,030
It's okay.

231
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,500
Is it?

232
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,755
Skulls, is it?

233
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:40,415
Galen.

234
00:15:40,515 --> 00:15:41,435
I don't need to be patted on the head.

235
00:15:41,535 --> 00:15:42,755
You can tell me I frakked up.

236
00:15:42,855 --> 00:15:43,950
Nobody got hurt, ok?

237
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:44,765
Forget it.

238
00:15:44,865 --> 00:15:46,205
- You're only human.
- No!

239
00:15:46,305 --> 00:15:47,520
Don't say that!

240
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,795
Tell me I frakked up!

241
00:15:48,895 --> 00:15:50,160
Say it!

242
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,080
Tell me I frakked up!

243
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,475
Any one of you.

244
00:15:54,575 --> 00:15:56,020
Cowards!

245
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,800
Chief, uh, I can handle this.

246
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,930
Why don't you take a little down time?

247
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:06,680
Get out of the raptor, Figurski.

248
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:30,190
People have room in their
hearts for one great belief.

249
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,720
You or the old gods,

250
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,080
which one will it be?

251
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:42,160
Why can't I just be a man?

252
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,115
Do I really need to take on
the gods single-handed?

253
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:50,280
Oh, but imagine the kind of man
you'll be when you do.

254
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:58,035
Surely such a man must be magnificent,
larger-than-life, godlike himself.

255
00:16:58,135 --> 00:17:00,340
What are you talking about?

256
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,130
It's not about that at all.

257
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,100
It's about this.

258
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,270
Stop!

259
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,550
Stop.

260
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,000
This is unacceptable.

261
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:33,370
We have been targeted because of
what we believe by those

262
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:37,925
who answer to faceless gods that bear
no relevance in our world.

263
00:17:38,025 --> 00:17:40,180
They want us to be afraid.

264
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,670
And I'm tired of being afraid.

265
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:49,540
The time has come to make a stand.

266
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,140
And that time is now.

267
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,025
Gaius, what-- what are you doing?

268
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,260
Where are you going?

269
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,370
Gaius?

270
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:08,780
We want justice, not
these stupid old gods!

271
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:10,880
Sir, we're having a service.

272
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,850
Are you?

273
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,430
But whom are you serving?

274
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,280
- I have to ask you to leave.
- Do you?

275
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,990
Would you be serving Zeus?

276
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,975
Apparently, king of the gods,
who also happened to be,

277
00:18:19,075 --> 00:18:20,995
let me tell you, a serial rapist.

278
00:18:21,095 --> 00:18:23,740
Prone to giving birth out
of his own forehead.

279
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,250
That's very likely, isn't it?

280
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,005
Well, gods strike me down.

281
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:28,445
- Oh, what are you going to do?
- Damn you.

282
00:18:28,545 --> 00:18:31,720
You ignorant witch, telling
the people lies and stories.

283
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,085
Maybe you want me to pray to Asklepius,

284
00:18:34,185 --> 00:18:36,180
who healed wounds with the
blood of gorgons,

285
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:40,650
or Aphrodite or Artemis or
any other of this rubbish!

286
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,305
How awful!

287
00:18:43,405 --> 00:18:45,790
Out of the way, you hideous old witch.

288
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:48,590
That's the kind of
rubbish that you made!

289
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,990
I will not be destroyed at this level!

290
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,035
Am I that late?

291
00:19:06,135 --> 00:19:07,180
No, this wasn't a treatment.

292
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,545
It was just a blood test.

293
00:19:09,645 --> 00:19:10,685
You brought a new book?

294
00:19:10,785 --> 00:19:11,330
Uh, yes.

295
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,795
Something different this time.

296
00:19:12,895 --> 00:19:13,930
It's a classic.

297
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:14,885
My favorite.

298
00:19:14,985 --> 00:19:18,240
"Searider Falcon", 
I haven't read it in years.

299
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,810
I don't remember how it ends.

300
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,975
I don't either. I never read the ending.

301
00:19:22,075 --> 00:19:23,665
You're kidding. It's your favorite.

302
00:19:23,765 --> 00:19:27,260
I like it so much, I
don't want it to be over.

303
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,935
So I'm saving it.

304
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:30,640
Maybe I should do that.

305
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,870
That's a bad idea. Maybe not.

306
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,185
Let me do that for you.

307
00:19:41,285 --> 00:19:43,380
Okay, thanks.

308
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,570
Baltar's back at home in the brig again.

309
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,540
Desecration of a temple.

310
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,685
It's his revenge for what
happened to him this morning.

311
00:19:53,785 --> 00:19:55,020
It was brutal.

312
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:59,685
I have my personnel trying to track down
anything on the Sons of Ares.

313
00:19:59,785 --> 00:20:01,010
But nobody's talking.

314
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,975
The thing is that Baltar
knows that there...

315
00:20:03,075 --> 00:20:04,670
are religious hardliners in Dogsville,

316
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,860
but he continues to provoke.

317
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:10,140
I just can't have a
religious war in this fleet.

318
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,415
Oh, please, no.

319
00:20:11,515 --> 00:20:13,146
Then the whole damn
thing will become our...

320
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:14,725
frakkin' responsibility, yours and mine.

321
00:20:14,825 --> 00:20:17,850
Seriously, Bill, we have 30,000 people
left and they're not happy

322
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,100
unless they're kicking
each other's teeth in.

323
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,700
This is what we've become?

324
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,960
No, it's him.

325
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:28,810
Baltar has an uncanny way of
stirring up all the crap.

326
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:33,163
I wonder if he'd be willing
to stay in lockdown,

327
00:20:33,263 --> 00:20:35,930
indefinitely, for his own safety.

328
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:38,090
And make a martyr out of him? No way.

329
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:41,629
Those girly, groupie,
sex whatever-they-are,

330
00:20:41,729 --> 00:20:43,880
they already think he's a god.

331
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,750
So we kick him off of the Galactica.

332
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,960
No, I want him close.

333
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:50,920
I'm going to the brig.

334
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,720
You want to see him?

335
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:55,830
I want him to see me.

336
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:04,945
Oh, we didn't even make it
to tomorrow, did we?

337
00:21:05,045 --> 00:21:07,060
You asked what I want.

338
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:12,020
I want to know how it feels to have
killed billions of human beings,

339
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:14,820
to have all that blood on your hands.

340
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,940
Think it through.

341
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,270
Because that's what I want.

342
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,850
I feel it.

343
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:25,950
Do you really think that I couldn't?

344
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,590
Do you?

345
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,255
Or do you turn it off?

346
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:33,595
Is there a switch in your
head that you turn off?

347
00:21:33,695 --> 00:21:37,120
You talk like we're different,
but you know we're not.

348
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,810
Weapons.

349
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,440
Working late, or up early, chief?

350
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,550
You act like you think
I'm made of switches and relays.

351
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:22,260
Look.

352
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,965
Veins, not wires.

353
00:22:25,065 --> 00:22:26,620
We're the same.

354
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,020
Do you see? We're the same.

355
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:40,150
Then tell me.

356
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,870
Tell you what?

357
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:47,130
How you live with what you've done.

358
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:55,480
Saul, are you asking for absolution?

359
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,340
Forgiveness?

360
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:02,100
I can give you that.

361
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:05,480
Stand down.

362
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:08,480
Step outside.

363
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,420
Just tell me what the trouble is.

364
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,810
You have nothing to offer me.

365
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,990
We're not the same.

366
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,035
Were you asleep?

367
00:23:37,135 --> 00:23:38,740
What is it this time?

368
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,640
Here to strip-search me?

369
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:45,145
Or could it possibly be
that your presence here

370
00:23:45,245 --> 00:23:49,580
means that the president has been
made aware of my situation.

371
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,835
It's being looked into.

372
00:23:51,935 --> 00:23:52,860
Is it really?

373
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,460
Aggressively.

374
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,870
Now here's the thing.

375
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,420
I want you to look at me, Gaius.

376
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,160
Just look at me.

377
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,190
This is a wig.

378
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:15,520
I'm dying.

379
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:20,290
Now, if you look in my eyes...

380
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,760
Go ahead, look.

381
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,060
...you can probably see it.

382
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,460
I'm very sorry.

383
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:27,935
No, no, no, no, I don't want your pity.

384
00:24:28,035 --> 00:24:29,030
I'm still doing my job.

385
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:33,660
In fact, I'm gonna aggressively pursue
the men that attacked you,

386
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,707
and I'm going to limit
the size of public...

387
00:24:36,807 --> 00:24:39,550
assemblies to protect
your people, but...

388
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:43,265
...I'm going to be slipping away
from this life very soon,

389
00:24:43,365 --> 00:24:46,740
and I've gotten kind of curious as
to what that's going to be like,

390
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,790
and so I did some research.

391
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,405
And there are some people who say that

392
00:24:50,505 --> 00:24:52,375
when people are getting
closer to their death,

393
00:24:52,475 --> 00:24:57,850
they just don't care as much about rules
and laws and conventional morality.

394
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,150
Are you threatening me?

395
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:02,690
No, no, I'm just saying:
have a quiet life,

396
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:06,030
and I'll die a quiet little death,

397
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,340
and everyone will be happy.

398
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:13,235
It's just that I'm not in the
mood any longer to indulge you.

399
00:25:13,335 --> 00:25:15,270
And that's...

400
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,970
...all.

401
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:27,000
And you are being released, so...

402
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,170
...stay safe.

403
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:47,680
Hey, chief.

404
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:57,380
We all miss her, chief.

405
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:01,260
I understand if you need some time off,

406
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,400
or even if you might need more
shifts to keep yourself busy.

407
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:07,670
No one knows how they're going
to react to loss like this,

408
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:09,310
or what they're gonna need.

409
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:13,000
I don't need special treatment.

410
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:19,310
I guess she just couldn't take it, huh?

411
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:21,630
Being married to a Cylon?

412
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:24,660
Being the mother of a
half-breed abomination?

413
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,120
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

414
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,020
She was a good woman.

415
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,230
If you really believe that,
you wouldn't have threatened

416
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:52,420
to stick her up against
a bulkhead and shoot her.

417
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:57,280
It's okay, though.

418
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:00,670
I thought about doing
it many times myself.

419
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,655
Believe me.

420
00:27:01,755 --> 00:27:02,465
Chief, it's...

421
00:27:02,565 --> 00:27:06,270
How many of us ended up with the people
we really wanted to be with?

422
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,880
Got stuck with the best
of limited options?

423
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,760
And why?

424
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:22,305
Because the ones we really wanted,
the really loved, were dead and dying,

425
00:27:22,405 --> 00:27:24,170
or turned out to be Cylons
and they didn't know it.

426
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,490
If Boomer had...

427
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:29,095
- Listen.
- If I had known.

428
00:27:29,195 --> 00:27:30,390
- Listen, let's--
- No.

429
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,810
- Let's go.
- No, no.

430
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,745
I didn't know.

431
00:27:34,845 --> 00:27:36,765
- Let's go home.
- I didn't know.

432
00:27:36,865 --> 00:27:40,825
So I buried my head in the sand
and I took it and I settled!

433
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:45,250
I settled for that shriek,
those dull vacant eyes,

434
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:47,690
the boiled cabbage stench of her.

435
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:50,275
And why? Because this is my life!

436
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:52,735
This is the life I picked.

437
00:27:52,835 --> 00:27:55,115
And it's fine, but you
know what? It's not.

438
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:56,625
I didn't pick this life.

439
00:27:56,725 --> 00:27:58,630
This is not my frakkin' life.

440
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:00,815
What the hell's gotten into you?

441
00:28:00,915 --> 00:28:02,640
Don't do this.

442
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,705
Don't do this to her memory.

443
00:28:04,805 --> 00:28:06,075
You know what?

444
00:28:06,175 --> 00:28:08,910
I'm sorry if I'm not gonna do this
the way you want me to,

445
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:10,780
or the way you might.

446
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,600
But I will not make an angel out of
someone who wasn't an angel.

447
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,210
But I can see you have,

448
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,170
and now you've come down here
to be in my club,

449
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:23,090
but you're not in my club.

450
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:24,820
You don't know what frakkin' club I'm in

451
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,440
'cause you never asked
the right questions.

452
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,820
Chief, let's get out of here.

453
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,195
No.

454
00:28:31,295 --> 00:28:32,840
Why don't you go?

455
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,190
Take care of your precious ship.

456
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:35,395
Stop it.

457
00:28:35,495 --> 00:28:37,370
Stop all of this.

458
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:39,515
'Cause if you don't,
I'm going to have to act on it.

459
00:28:39,615 --> 00:28:41,080
- Now shut up.
- Great!

460
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,230
Do it!

461
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:42,930
Please!

462
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:45,320
For the love of gods,
please demote me.

463
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,950
Get me off your frakkin' ship!

464
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:54,559
Specialist Tyrol, 
I want you off my hangar deck

465
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:58,005
before you endanger another pilot.

466
00:28:58,105 --> 00:29:01,513
You're to report to petty officer Bassom...

467
00:29:01,613 --> 00:29:04,940
tomorrow morning at
0600 for reassignment.

468
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,270
Do you understand?

469
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,380
Of course you have authority
over emergency measures,

470
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:57,870
but you bulldozed this through
after the session was closed.

471
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:59,505
- Yes.
- Exactly...

472
00:29:59,605 --> 00:30:01,385
It's a crowd control measure.

473
00:30:01,485 --> 00:30:03,958
I also authorized the
repair of a cargo elevator.

474
00:30:04,058 --> 00:30:05,810
Do you want to talk about that too?

475
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:06,470
Crowd control?

476
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:08,095
Looks to me like it was
pretty well designed purely

477
00:30:08,195 --> 00:30:10,340
to stop Gaius Baltar's organization.

478
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,960
You mean his cult?

479
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,120
Well, his "cult" was attacked.

480
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,560
And from what I'm
hearing around the fleet,

481
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,640
it was pretty brutal.

482
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,900
It was brutal.

483
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:20,005
Exactly.

484
00:30:20,105 --> 00:30:24,025
And this measure is designed explicitly
to protect those people.

485
00:30:24,125 --> 00:30:28,270
If they aren't gathering en masse,
they aren't provoking resentment.

486
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,980
It limits his group, whilst
permitting more mainstream worship.

487
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,170
Wherever Gaius Baltar is,
violence happens.

488
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,330
And if he doesn't cause it, he draws it.

489
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:40,380
My job, Mr. Adama, is
and always will be,

490
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,345
to keep the people safe.

491
00:30:43,445 --> 00:30:47,510
Madame president,
I have to wonder if this resolution

492
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:50,505
couldn't be used against other
offshoot religious groups.

493
00:30:50,605 --> 00:30:51,750
Absolutely not.

494
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,235
Gaius Baltar is a special case,

495
00:30:53,335 --> 00:30:54,360
you know that.

496
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,490
And we're making him a special case.

497
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,450
And how are we doing that?

498
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:58,740
We're fueling his argument.

499
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,170
I mean, after all, is
he preaching violence?

500
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,510
- Immoral acts?
- I don't know.

501
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:04,815
I haven't been to one of his...
what are they called? Services?

502
00:31:04,915 --> 00:31:09,035
It's not that far from what some of
our own Mithras followers believe.

503
00:31:09,135 --> 00:31:11,240
We have Mithrasaries among the Gemenese.

504
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,935
Can this order be applied to them?

505
00:31:13,035 --> 00:31:14,020
Clear your heads.

506
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,105
We are talking about Gaius Baltar.

507
00:31:16,205 --> 00:31:20,750
Everyone in this room
experienced tragedy at New Caprica.

508
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:22,450
Have we forgotten?

509
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,865
Will you open this order

510
00:31:25,965 --> 00:31:28,410
- to a full quorum vote?
- No.

511
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:30,330
We can override, madam president.

512
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,990
I cannot let this stand.

513
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,050
You can override, and you cannot
let this stand, Mr. Adama?

514
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:37,865
Then you open it up to a vote.

515
00:31:37,965 --> 00:31:42,050
And if you strike this down,
you can all go back to your constituents

516
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,420
and you can tell them what you've done,

517
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,590
and "we, the people"
will have triumphed.

518
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:48,160
But think about what
it's gonna cost you.

519
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:52,110
Because every single one of you remember

520
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:56,060
what it was like when Gaius Baltar
had political power,

521
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,845
and you should be
terrified to think about

522
00:31:58,945 --> 00:32:02,900
what this man will do with
blind religious devotion.

523
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,900
So go ahead.

524
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,660
Vote.

525
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,610
Should I get used to
waking up to this face?

526
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,280
You're traveling light.

527
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,890
An informal chat.

528
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:40,110
Just you and me.

529
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:42,870
...and the man watching
through the cameras.

530
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,860
You haven't answered my question.

531
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,640
You want to know how I work?

532
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,995
If I can turn off pain?

533
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,690
Can you?

534
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:55,910
I want the pain.

535
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,710
It's how I learn.

536
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,600
I was instrumental in the
destruction of humanity,

537
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,460
but at the same time,
I learned because...

538
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,900
because I fell in love.

539
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:13,780
With a human man.

540
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,270
And he was mortal.

541
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:19,920
And fallible.

542
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:24,855
And he had this incredible
pride in himself.

543
00:33:24,955 --> 00:33:27,450
He thought he knew everything
there was to know.

544
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:31,810
And I loved him with my whole heart.

545
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:40,310
And then one day, I realized
I wouldn't have him forever.

546
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,460
I understood what I'd done.

547
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:49,240
How I betrayed him and humanity.

548
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:55,840
And that pain taught me
to understand death.

549
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,175
Baltar could die,

550
00:34:00,275 --> 00:34:02,255
- and I loved him.
- No.

551
00:34:02,355 --> 00:34:05,110
- Baltar's heart was ephemeral.
- No.

552
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,950
Baltar's body was fragile in my hands.

553
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:12,370
No, we are not gonna talk about the
fragile body of Gaius frakkin' Baltar!

554
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:13,685
Door!

555
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:15,220
Door!

556
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:17,380
Dismissed.

557
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:19,030
Clear out, out!

558
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:21,940
Frak, what's he gonna do to her?

559
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,975
I can tell you how to turn it off.

560
00:34:31,075 --> 00:34:32,160
How?

561
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,820
Pain is how I learn from the guilt.

562
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,860
There's wisdom there.

563
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,595
Clarity.

564
00:34:37,695 --> 00:34:39,495
You know yourself there.

565
00:34:39,595 --> 00:34:40,750
Pain.

566
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:45,770
Our minds were designed
based on your minds.

567
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:49,470
We learn things about how you work
that you've never known.

568
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:58,560
When you're in pain, that's
when you learn who you really are.

569
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:05,700
That's when you focus,
sharp as the point of a knife.

570
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:19,510
I can give you that clarity again.

571
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:25,150
I'm sorry, sir, I'm not
supposed to let you enter.

572
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,215
What's going on?
What are you doing?

573
00:35:26,315 --> 00:35:28,265
There are 12 people inside already.

574
00:35:28,365 --> 00:35:29,335
You can count, can you?

575
00:35:29,435 --> 00:35:33,185
Yes, sir, you can't enter without
breaking emergency provision 170.

576
00:35:33,285 --> 00:35:34,485
People, let me out.
If I leave, then he can come in.

577
00:35:34,614 --> 00:35:35,700
Yes, if she leaves,
then I can come in.

578
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,555
We're asking everyone to stay
inside for safety reasons.

579
00:35:37,655 --> 00:35:38,655
Oh, this is absurd.

580
00:35:38,755 --> 00:35:40,395
- You're just counting heads.
- I have my orders.

581
00:35:40,495 --> 00:35:41,675
Yeah, but I live here, okay?

582
00:35:41,775 --> 00:35:43,485
I live here, and so do
some of these women.

583
00:35:43,585 --> 00:35:45,140
Where are we supposed to go?

584
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,455
This is your moment, Gaius.

585
00:35:48,555 --> 00:35:50,780
Step forward. Make a stand.

586
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,290
Uh, I don't want to be a hero.

587
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:55,545
I just want to go to bed.

588
00:35:55,645 --> 00:35:56,985
- Go to sleep.
- Look at me.

589
00:35:57,085 --> 00:35:58,590
I promise you.

590
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:01,820
Step forward, and you will not be hurt.

591
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,185
- Promise me?
- Yes,

592
00:36:04,285 --> 00:36:07,130
You can lie down inside. Go in.

593
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:11,240
Stop, sir.

594
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:14,300
Gaius!

595
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:26,720
Get your damn hands off me,
you frakkin' freak machine!

596
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:42,050
Can you feel it, Saul?

597
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:44,760
Can you feel the clarity of it?

598
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:57,170
Stay down or clear this area, sir!

599
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:59,080
You have to do this.

600
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:01,720
The gain will outweigh the cost.

601
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:14,760
I want to stay down.

602
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,930
I really want to stay down.

603
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,450
No, you don't.

604
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,600
Stay down, please, sir!

605
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,255
Wait, wait, stop!

606
00:37:31,355 --> 00:37:32,680
Lieutenant.

607
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,180
Stand down.

608
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,610
The quorum has just met
in an emergency session.

609
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,970
Full right of assembly
has been restored.

610
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:45,000
You can, uh, you can go
back into your home.

611
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,490
- No one will stop you.
- Oh, Gaius.

612
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,510
Thank you.

613
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:57,330
I don't do these things for you.

614
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,060
You do them because
your God compels you.

615
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,370
Okay, okay.

616
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,650
Lee has no idea.

617
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:20,070
He really has no idea.

618
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,845
Have you heard anything I've said?

619
00:38:24,945 --> 00:38:29,740
There are pragmatic realities
he refuses to face.

620
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,680
Well, that's a problem, of course.

621
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:37,300
He's doing what he thinks is right.

622
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,360
Well, yeah, he's Lee.

623
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:44,090
Thing is, it probably is the
right thing, but...

624
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:48,345
sometimes the right thing is a luxury,

625
00:38:48,445 --> 00:38:51,065
and it can have profoundly
dangerous consequences,

626
00:38:51,165 --> 00:38:55,830
and yet it's almost as if he
doesn't want that to be true.

627
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,540
Okay, I gotta stop this.

628
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:02,110
I'm not supposed to get upset
during treatment.

629
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:05,860
Will you read the next chapter?

630
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,405
I must warn you that I'm getting into
the part that I haven't read yet.

631
00:39:11,505 --> 00:39:12,860
Oh dear.

632
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,170
Are you going to be able to continue?

633
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,260
"Chapter 7:

634
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:31,170
"The raft was not as
seaworthy as I had hoped.

635
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:34,790
"The waves repeatedly
threatened to swamp it.

636
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:37,110
"I wasn't afraid to die.

637
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:43,110
"I was afraid of the
emptiness that I felt inside."

638
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,540
I couldn't feel anything.

639
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,670
That's what scared me.

640
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:57,380
It came into my thoughts.

641
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,810
It filled them.

642
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,120
It felt good.

643
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,030
More.

644
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:09,950
No.

645
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,325
Keep going.

646
00:40:13,425 --> 00:40:15,870
No, I made a mistake.

647
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,820
This isn't what you need.

648
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,460
I'm not a priest.

649
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:32,920
I've never even been a
particularly good man.

650
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:41,740
I have, in fact, been a
profoundly selfish man,

651
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,290
but that doesn't matter, you see.

652
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:49,400
Something in the universe loves me.

653
00:40:53,820 --> 00:41:00,730
Something in the universe
loves the entity that is me.

654
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:04,645
I will choose to call
this something "God".

655
00:41:04,745 --> 00:41:10,395
A singular spark that dwells
in the soul of every living being.

656
00:41:10,495 --> 00:41:15,100
If you look inside yourself,
you will find this spark too.

657
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,170
You will.

658
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:21,280
But you have to look...

659
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:23,820
...deep.

660
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:27,130
Love your faults.

661
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:30,530
Embrace them.

662
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:35,700
If God embraces them,
then how can they be faults?

663
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,990
Love yourself.

664
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,430
You have to love yourself.

665
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:48,170
If we don't love ourselves,
how can we love others?

666
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:53,035
And when we know what we are,

667
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:56,995
then we can find the
truth out about others,

668
00:41:57,095 --> 00:41:58,790
see what they are,

669
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,660
the truth about them.

670
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:09,450
And you know what the truth is,
the truth about them,

671
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:12,110
about you,

672
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,270
about me,

673
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:16,590
do you?

674
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:29,060
The truth is, we are all perfect,
just as we are.

675
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:33,130
God only loves that which is perfect,
and he loves you.

676
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,660
He loves you because you are perfect.

677
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:41,970
You are perfect just as you are.
