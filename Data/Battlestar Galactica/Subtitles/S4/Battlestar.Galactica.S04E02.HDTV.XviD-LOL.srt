00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,690
TWELVE CYLON MODELS

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:08,170
SEVEN ARE KNOWN

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,170
FOUR LIVE IN SECRET

4
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,270
ONE WILL BE REVEALED

5
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,540
Previously on Battlestar Galactica

6
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,960
Aurora, goddess of the dawn.

7
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,690
I thought that it would be a nice
figurehead for your model ship.

8
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:28,980
A fresh start.

9
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,050
Thank you.

10
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:32,870
Starbuck, you're getting too low!

11
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,530
Come on, Lee, get her out of there.

12
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:35,620
You come back!

13
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,830
Just let me go.

14
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,380
No!

15
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,570
Baltar's trial may
have been the trigger,

16
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:45,635
but this is a feeling
I've been having for a while.

17
00:00:45,735 --> 00:00:47,260
It's time for a change.

18
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,810
Please, God, don't let this child die.

19
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,525
How can you take him and let me live?

20
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:54,555
God answered your prayers.

21
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:55,520
You have to see.

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,505
Look at him.

23
00:00:57,605 --> 00:00:58,950
And no trace of a fever.

24
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:00,810
It's a miracle.

25
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,540
I need to know about the other five.

26
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,590
The types we've never seen.

27
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,070
It's true.

28
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,320
We're cylons.

29
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,850
And we have been from the start.

30
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,275
Even after that raider scanned
me with that red light,

31
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:15,910
Damn thing just cut and ran.

32
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,770
You think it recognized you as a cylon?

33
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,295
Maybe that's why it didn't shoot me.

34
00:01:19,395 --> 00:01:21,600
More important, why didn't I shoot him?

35
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,875
Okay, what the hell's going on?

36
00:01:23,975 --> 00:01:25,305
I'm off the ship for a few hours,

37
00:01:25,405 --> 00:01:27,070
- and everybody's acting--
- A few hours?

38
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,900
Kara, you were gone for over two months.

39
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,770
That's impossible.

40
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,515
How did you get here?

41
00:01:33,615 --> 00:01:35,635
I told you, I don't know exactly.

42
00:01:35,735 --> 00:01:37,840
Damn it, they're still going
in the wrong direction.

43
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,500
Another jump and
I'm gonna lose my way all together.

44
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,670
It's Roslin.

45
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,095
The old man's not gonna listen to me.

46
00:01:43,195 --> 00:01:44,440
I gotta get to her.

47
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,540
No, no, wait!

48
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,745
Look alive!

49
00:02:07,845 --> 00:02:10,560
And for frak sake,
don't shoot the godsdamned president!

50
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,735
Just let me talk to her.

51
00:02:11,835 --> 00:02:14,450
Talk all you want,
but it ends with the first bang.

52
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,545
We're rollin' down here.

53
00:02:15,645 --> 00:02:17,190
Starbuck's got the president.

54
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,680
Gaeta, take the com.

55
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,540
Move.

56
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,280
Move!

57
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:41,530
Come on.

58
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,500
Move, come on!

59
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,700
Over by the couch.

60
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,700
Now!

61
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,170
I want to hate you so much.

62
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,120
So much.

63
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,170
You had a vision.

64
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,440
Remember?

65
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,500
The arrow, the temple.

66
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:24,875
I went down to that planet with you,
and it was a frakkin' toaster party.

67
00:03:24,975 --> 00:03:26,500
A lot of good people died. Remember?

68
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,000
Yes, I do.

69
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,270
I trusted you.

70
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,590
On a vision.

71
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,510
That's it.

72
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,930
A vision!

73
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,760
I saw.

74
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,240
Earth.

75
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,830
I saw it with my own eyes.

76
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,145
And it's calling me back.

77
00:03:51,245 --> 00:03:53,200
We're going the wrong way.

78
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,050
Why can't you trust me?

79
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,100
Shoot me.

80
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,890
If you think I'm a cylon,
them I'm your enemy.

81
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,520
Shoot your enemy.

82
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,470
Take it!

83
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:22,040
I'm no more a cylon than you are.

84
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,910
And you know it.

85
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,770
I wish I did.

86
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,000
I've put my life on the line
for this frakkin' ship.

87
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,525
I have ate, slept, and fought next
to the people that I love.

88
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,810
I have pissed off my friends!

89
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,625
I have broken more rules
than I've followed!

90
00:04:42,725 --> 00:04:44,255
I frakked up, okay!

91
00:04:44,355 --> 00:04:45,790
I messed up!

92
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,270
But it's all that I have.

93
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,470
Those people are my family.

94
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:58,210
And none of us belong here.

95
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,350
Two down.

96
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,470
We've got two down!

97
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,235
Shoot me--if I'm a cylon, then shoot me!

98
00:05:05,335 --> 00:05:07,250
They made you perfect, didn't they?

99
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,335
Down on the floor.

100
00:05:17,435 --> 00:05:19,325
Down on the floor now! Now!

101
00:05:19,425 --> 00:05:20,690
Let go of me!

102
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,870
What are-- get off me!

103
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,155
What are you doing?

104
00:05:24,255 --> 00:05:26,040
I am not a cylon, Mathias!

105
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,710
- Madam president.
- Mathias! Gods!

106
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,790
- I don't...
- What the frak's going on here?

107
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:32,495
I thought you were on the move.

108
00:05:32,595 --> 00:05:35,090
We were--she's out of her frakkin' mind!

109
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,885
- Gods!
- You all right?

110
00:05:36,985 --> 00:05:38,340
Get off me!

111
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,440
Get off!

112
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,690
Listen to me, please.

113
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,540
I'm losing it.

114
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:53,700
The ringing.

115
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,570
The way to earth.

116
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,110
It's getting weaker.

117
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,210
Don't you understand?

118
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,010
Don't any of you understand?

119
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,950
It was so-- it was so clear.

120
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,600
Like it was coming from the next room.

121
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,800
Stop looking at me like that.

122
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,040
I can feel it slipping away.

123
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:27,500
Even without jumping as we move,

124
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,960
it's half of what it
was when I got here.

125
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,210
Half.

126
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,650
If we keep jumping, it'll be gone,
and we'll never find it again.

127
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,800
I thought that's what we wanted.

128
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,385
A way to earth.

129
00:06:45,485 --> 00:06:46,850
Do you hear me?

130
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,105
- Get her out of here.
- Yes, let's go.

131
00:06:49,205 --> 00:06:52,810
You better work on your aim,
because I'm not gonna stop!

132
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,170
You're gonna have to kill me!

133
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:59,080
One more jump and it'll be gone!

134
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,670
Admiral.

137
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:25,480
39,676 SURVIVORS

138
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,160
IN SEARCH OF A HOME

139
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:33,450
CALLED EARTH

140

<font color=#38B0DE>Battlestar Galactica

141
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:54,177
The excited state decays
by vibrational...

142
00:07:54,277 --> 00:07:56,910
relaxation into the first
excited similar state

143
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,185
Yes yes and merrily we go

144
00:07:59,285 --> 00:08:03,035
Reduce atmosphere nitrogen
by 0.03 percents.

145
00:08:03,135 --> 00:08:06,470
It is not much consolation that
society will pick up the bits,

146
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:10,540
leaving us at** modern where punishment
rather than interdiction is paramount.

147
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,250
Please cut the fuse.

148
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,780
They will not harm their own.

149
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:17,307
End of Line. Limiting diffusions
to two dimensions and...

150
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:20,810
increases the number of evolutionary
jumps within the species.

151
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,560
Rise and measure the temple of the five.

152
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,610
Transformation is the goal.

153
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,710
They will not harm their own.

154
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,290
That...

155
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,665
The hybrid is clearly
telling us something.

156
00:08:32,765 --> 00:08:34,385
The hybrid is always
telling us something.

157
00:08:34,485 --> 00:08:37,370
They are supposed to maintain
operations on each ship,

158
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,850
Not vomiting metaphysics.

159
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,385
All right.

160
00:08:44,485 --> 00:08:47,535
I give up. What? What is
she trying to tell us?

161
00:08:47,635 --> 00:08:51,690
They're in the colonial
fleet with the humans.

162
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,460
They...? They who?

163
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,430
The Final Five.

164
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:01,382
The raiders refused to
fight because they sensed...

165
00:09:01,482 --> 00:09:03,145
the Final Five might be
in the colonial fleet.

166
00:09:03,245 --> 00:09:06,020
They could have been caught.
They could be in hiding.

167
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,545
No.... Stop.

168
00:09:07,645 --> 00:09:09,155
Stop right now.

169
00:09:09,255 --> 00:09:11,278
Turn around. Go and
take a cleansing walk...

170
00:09:11,378 --> 00:09:13,770
and I am going to try and
forget what I've just heard.

171
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,965
The Final Five, Cavil, they are near!
This is far more important...

172
00:09:17,065 --> 00:09:18,905
But their eyes must have
seen, witnessed over time...

173
00:09:19,005 --> 00:09:21,405
- Do they look anything like us?
- That's enough.

174
00:09:21,505 --> 00:09:25,780
Don't you realize what you are doing?
You'are openly discussing the Final Five.

175
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,610
That's forbidden.

176
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,265
You're toying with our survival.

177
00:09:36,365 --> 00:09:37,915
Look at yourselves.

178
00:09:38,015 --> 00:09:40,939
Look, there's millions of
Twos that have that nose...

179
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,205
millions of Sixes that possess that mouth,

180
00:09:43,305 --> 00:09:46,595
Eights share those breasts
and Ones have this brain.

181
00:09:46,695 --> 00:09:48,870
We're mechanized copies.

182
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:52,245
There's a reason the original programmers
clearly felt

183
00:09:52,345 --> 00:09:54,755
that it's a mistake for us to
contact the Final Five!

184
00:09:54,855 --> 00:09:55,505
No.

185
00:09:55,605 --> 00:09:59,050
Violating that programming
threatens our survival!

186
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:01,305
Something has changed.

187
00:10:01,405 --> 00:10:03,065
Thoughts have changed.
Yes, they change.

188
00:10:03,165 --> 00:10:04,610
The raiders changed.

189
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,520
That's where all this started, with them.

190
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,240
Somehow they exceeded their programming,

191
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,625
and unlike us, they
can't correct themselves.

192
00:10:11,725 --> 00:10:13,425
So we're gonna have to do it for them.

193
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:14,810
Do what?

194
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,650
We'll reconfigure their neural architecture,

195
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,250
and shave down their heuristic responses.

196
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,785
Dumb them down? Lobotomize them?

197
00:10:22,885 --> 00:10:24,985
They're tools, not pets.

198
00:10:25,085 --> 00:10:27,485
But in any case, it has to be done.

199
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:28,775
Says who?

200
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:32,590
Says God Almighty,
the voice of reason, that's who!

201
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,550
When are you gonna hear it?

202
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,915
You don't have the authority to make
any change without a majority vote.

203
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:40,905
Well, we'll vote.

204
00:10:41,005 --> 00:10:42,985
The Fours and Fives will be on my side.

205
00:10:43,085 --> 00:10:44,370
There will be a vote.

206
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,095
The raiders hear what we hear.

207
00:10:46,195 --> 00:10:48,365
The raiders are simple machines.

208
00:10:48,465 --> 00:10:49,435
No.

209
00:10:49,535 --> 00:10:51,345
Something extraordinary has happened.

210
00:10:51,445 --> 00:10:52,725
Something is calling to us.

211
00:10:52,825 --> 00:10:57,375
Pushing us to discover our origins,
to understand our place in the universe.

212
00:10:57,475 --> 00:10:58,925
The raiders are part of that,

213
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:02,850
- and the Final Five--
- Are anywhere but with the humans.

214
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,810
You're late.

215
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,790
I had to wait for Cally to nod off, okay?

216
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,435
She's having trouble sleeping.

217
00:11:17,535 --> 00:11:18,885
- Did you see Kara?
- I saw her.

218
00:11:18,985 --> 00:11:20,565
She's crazy as a latrine rat.

219
00:11:20,665 --> 00:11:23,025
If anything, she's more
like Starbuck than ever.

220
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:23,975
She's my wife!

221
00:11:24,075 --> 00:11:26,455
And the president nearly
put a bullet in her skull

222
00:11:26,555 --> 00:11:28,905
because she suspected
her of being a cylon.

223
00:11:29,005 --> 00:11:30,070
You are one!

224
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:34,020
We bring attention to ourselves,
we're frakked!

225
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:38,480
If Starbuck is one of us,
she's playing it big the other way.

226
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,350
The four of us heard the music
and sought each other out.

227
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,800
She hasn't.

228
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,570
We're still missing one.

229
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,280
Baltar.

230
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,730
Not Baltar, but when I found him
in the temple on the algae planet,

231
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,345
he was with one of those skin jobs.
The one they call D'Anna.

232
00:12:02,445 --> 00:12:04,255
She saw something in there--
I don't know what it is.

233
00:12:04,355 --> 00:12:05,570
But they talked.

234
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,570
He might know something.

235
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:13,165
He's got those one-god nut cases
believing he's some kind of healer.

236
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:15,820
He brought some boy out from a coma.

237
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,245
Maybe he knows who the fifth is.

238
00:12:19,345 --> 00:12:21,865
Yeah, maybe he knows who we are.

239
00:12:21,965 --> 00:12:24,740
Then we gotta get in close and find out.

240
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,960
How do you propose we do that?

241
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,080
Take him out for drinks?

242
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,740
Well, he is accomplished at two things.

243
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,120
Lying in his cell, and lying in a woman.

244
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:37,270
He'd poke a skin job.

245
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,655
He racked up a Six, that's a given.

246
00:12:39,755 --> 00:12:41,690
There is no way.

247
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:44,895
You don't have to get on
your back for him, but--

248
00:12:44,995 --> 00:12:46,800
Oh, gee, thanks.

249
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,440
What were you doing?

250
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,490
What were you thinking?

251
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,320
What happened to you?

252
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,955
I saw...

253
00:13:13,055 --> 00:13:14,320
Earth.

254
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,115
The shape of it, the smell of it.

255
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,435
The feel of it on my skin in my pores,

256
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:24,650
and I swear to you, it was like
I'd been there before.

257
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,950
Like I never left.

258
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,070
You're too stupid to figure out you just
screwed over the one ally you had.

259
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:41,210
You didn't have the guts to hold on.

260
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,740
Tell me.

261
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,940
Who's gonna help you?

262
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,670
Yeah, frak me, huh?

263
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,690
It sure as hell isn't gonna be you.

264
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:03,430
You've gotta remind yourself
that you're somebody else.

265
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,690
You're the president's wet nurse.

266
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:14,020
You're the one who
doesn't have the guts.

267
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,560
Nice to know you still care, admiral.

268
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:43,570
We're going the wrong way!

269
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,490
We have all conferred with our models,
and the results are in.

270
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,010
The Fours and the Fives
have joined us Ones,

271
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,195
and they voted to
reconfigure the raiders.

272
00:14:57,295 --> 00:14:58,740
Gee, what a surprise.

273
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,065
Well, the Twos, Sixes and Eights
 voted against it,

274
00:15:02,165 --> 00:15:03,650
so we're deadlocked.

275
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:06,490
Hopelessly... but you were right.

276
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:09,485
And I'm machine enough to admit
that I was wrong.

277
00:15:09,585 --> 00:15:11,190
What are you talking about?

278
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:15,145
Something extraordinary has happened.

279
00:15:15,245 --> 00:15:16,380
Eight.

280
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,500
What's going on?

281
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:27,760
Boomer.

282
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:32,770
I'm not going to sugarcoat this.

283
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,185
I'll just say that this Eight
has voted to reconfigure.

284
00:15:37,285 --> 00:15:39,930
- What?
- Shocked? I was shocked too.

285
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,990
But no one has ever voted
against their model.

286
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,465
No one. Is this true?

287
00:15:48,565 --> 00:15:50,650
We have to be able to defend ourselves.

288
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,700
No, this is unconscionable.

289
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:55,250
This is wrong. She can't.

290
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,055
You had something to do with this.

291
00:15:57,155 --> 00:15:59,520
No, it was her decision totally.

292
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,875
- You cannot allow this.
- There is no law. There's no edict.

293
00:16:02,975 --> 00:16:04,145
There's nothing that forbids it.

294
00:16:04,245 --> 00:16:06,965
It's just-- it's never happened before.

295
00:16:07,065 --> 00:16:10,725
Yeah, try and remember you said
that when he boxes your line.

296
00:16:10,825 --> 00:16:12,380
Now, don't be a sore loser.

297
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,975
If you do this, we all lose.

298
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:16,295
We think it's for the best.

299
00:16:16,395 --> 00:16:17,350
The best?

300
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,060
Have you lost your mind?

301
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:22,070
Our identities are
determined by our models.

302
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,700
Each model is unique.

303
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,370
We belong together.

304
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,180
You know this better than anyone.

305
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,310
Mechanized copies.

306
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:31,970
Those are your very words.

307
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:34,180
Something has changed.

308
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,885
Those are your very words,

309
00:16:35,985 --> 00:16:37,550
and I wholeheartedly agree.

310
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:40,615
The raiders are sentient, 
just as we are.

311
00:16:40,715 --> 00:16:43,480
There was a plan,
a divine plan in our design.

312
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:44,920
You're butchering them.

313
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,660
We're reconfiguring them.

314
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,660
You are not God.

315
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,050
No.

316
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,800
I'm a mechanic.

317
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,215
And raiders were designed
to do a specific job.

318
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:58,330
They stopped doing it. I'm fixing that.

319
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:01,925
And when the cutting's all done,
they'll go back to being happy warriors.

320
00:17:02,025 --> 00:17:03,860
So let's move on, all right?

321
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,890
I'll pray for you.

322
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,860
I'll pray hard.

323
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,070
All right, you hooch hounds!

324
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,960
Lock it up!

325
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:54,285
- It's time.
- Shut the frak up! Pay attention.

326
00:17:54,385 --> 00:17:55,455
Pay attention.

327
00:17:55,555 --> 00:17:57,860
Hey! We're saying good-bye.

328
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,275
To the best damn jock you-- you pink
ass cones will ever hope to see.

329
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:04,530
Oh, shut up.

330
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,770
Major?

331
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:08,335
Let's go! Come on!

332
00:18:08,435 --> 00:18:11,330
I have a drink. Let's do this. 
Come on now.

333
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,620
I'm not thirsty.

334
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,830
To Galactica!

335
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,100
To Galactica!

336
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:28,790
To the men and women of Galactica.

337
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,595
To the admiral.

338
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,360
To the admiral.

339
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:38,140
Who commands the men
and women of Galactica.

340
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,240
And to our sweethearts,
husbands, and wives.

341
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,295
Sweethearts.

342
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:50,650
To our sweethearts.

343
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,920
To absent friends.

344
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,590
Absent friends.

345
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:03,930
Excuse me.

346
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,130
- Watch yourself.
- Excuse me.

347
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,190
You're spying on me, Tory.

348
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:30,240
I've seen you here.

349
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,770
No, no. I heard about the miracle.

350
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,400
The child?

351
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,870
Yes.

352
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,380
You mean Laura Roslin
has heard about it.

353
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:47,160
All right, I have been spying on you.

354
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,780
Well, it's lucky I was
sitting down, isn't it?

355
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:53,250
I've been watching these people.

356
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:55,220
The way they look at you.

357
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,255
Of course,
if you go screaming to the president

358
00:20:58,355 --> 00:21:00,600
that my newfound popularity
borders on the phenomenal,

359
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,210
then she should be very worried.

360
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:03,885
I came here on my own.

361
00:21:03,985 --> 00:21:05,700
And I slept with the boss last night.

362
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:09,175
Oh, come on, be nice.

363
00:21:09,275 --> 00:21:09,955
What's it gonna cost you?

364
00:21:10,055 --> 00:21:12,455
Oh, my God. Oh, my giddy-od!

365
00:21:12,555 --> 00:21:14,345
Get a grip, Gaius.

366
00:21:14,445 --> 00:21:17,660
She's not lying-- she really could
be a wonderful source of information.

367
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:19,800
Why don't you feel her out?

368
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,470
- Feel her what?
- What?

369
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,240
I'm not talking to you, actually.

370
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,850
Try and forget me for a moment.

371
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:28,590
Ask her what she's doing here.

372
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,690
I am talking to you.

373
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,840
Why did you come here?

374
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,640
Maybe it was a mistake.

375
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,400
Well, I can't stop thinking
about what's happened.

376
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,570
You were found innocent
when everyone hated you.

377
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:41,400
I hated you.

378
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,700
And this healed boy, the
return of Kara Thrace.

379
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,000
I mean, everyone thought she was dead.

380
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,000
So perhaps there are miracles.

381
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,900
Perhaps.

382
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,000
Thing is, somehow you seem
to be at the center of them.

383
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,400
Yes, I do, don't I?

384
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,600
I don't understand myself,
to be honest. Just, uh...

385
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:10,900
Well, it seems that
god has chosen me to sing his song.

386
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,900
- A song?
- Music. Did you say music?

387
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,172
No.

388
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:16,400
Yeah, you know, it's funny.
It's a lot like that.

389
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:22,500
It's like the distant chaos
of an orchestra tuning up.

390
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:26,600
And then somebody waves a magic wand,

391
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:31,800
and all of those notes
start to slide into place.

392
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:39,400
A grotesque, screeching cacophony
becomes a single melody.

393
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,000
I really shouldn't be seen here.

394
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,800
Who the frak are you?

395
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,000
What, am I supposed to be impressed?

396
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,255
I mean, you're me.
Obviously you're me, so--

397
00:22:55,355 --> 00:22:57,300
unless you're not me. Huh?

398
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,800
Six?

399
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,300
Is it you, Six, in disguise?

400
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,200
Now, why would she need to
disguise herself from you?

401
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,000
Well, you've got a very good point.

402
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,800
- Let's talk about Tory.
- Where is she?

403
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,122
Now, we should talk about Tory.

404
00:23:18,222 --> 00:23:20,600
'Cause we both know
where this is heading.

405
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,900
You like here, don't you?

406
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,000
Yeah, well, you know, she's,
uh-- she's a sexy lady.

407
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,400
- Yeah, yeah.
- You know, hot.

408
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,700
- You slay me. You really do, Gaius.
- Why?

409
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,200
She's more than all these things. 
She's special.

410
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,400
And you feel it.

411
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,600
- Yeah, fragile.
- Fragile.

412
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,561
Yeah, I sense that too.
You're very observant.

413
00:23:46,661 --> 00:23:47,100
Fragile.

414
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,800
- Handle with care.
- Oh, I'd love to.

415
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,900
You're enjoying that more than usual.

416
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,500
Hair of the dog. Lee's party.

417
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,200
What do we do now? Put her on trial?

418
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:21,000
Find Romo Lampkin? Take a show of hands?

419
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,700
I don't know.

420
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,700
Follow her into an ambush?

421
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,900
- She is driven.
- Yeah.

422
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:37,500
You gonna keep waltzing,
or are you gonna sit down and talk?

423
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,600
What's going on? Sit.

424
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,600
What if she's telling the truth?

425
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,100
She was supposed to die out there.

426
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:04,100
She didn't. I can't explain it.

427
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:10,100
What if she was meant to help us?
And this was a--

428
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:16,200
A what? A miracle?

429
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,800
Is that what you want to call this?
Go ahead, say it.

430
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,200
Grab your piece of the golden arrow.

431
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:30,700
I want to hear admiral atheist
say that a miracle happened.

432
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,400
You shot at her and
missed at close range.

433
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,000
Doloxan fraks with your aim.

434
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,600
So does doubt.

435
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,000
I pulled the trigger
and I'd do it again.

436
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:51,900
She put her life in front of a bullet
as if it had no meaning.

437
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,900
You drop an egg, you reach for another.

438
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:59,400
Maybe convincing you meant
more to her than her own life.

439
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,900
Is that your miracle?
You want to talk about miracles?

440
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,100
The very same day

441
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:11,000
that a very pale doctor informed me
that I had terminal cancer,

442
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,700
most of humanity was
annihilated, and I survived.

443
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:19,100
And by some mathematical absurdity,
I became president.

444
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,547
And then my cancer disappeared.

445
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:27,200
Long enough for us to
find a way to earth.

446
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,900
You can call it whatever you want.

447
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,500
And now I'm dying.

448
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,700
Don't talk that way.

449
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:42,200
Bill. You've gotta face this.

450
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,200
My life is coming to an end soon enough,

451
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:48,100
and I am not going to apologize
to you for not trusting her.

452
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:53,300
And I am not-- I am not going to
trust her with the fate of this fleet.

453
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,400
You are so buckled up inside.

454
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,333
You can't take any more loss.

455
00:27:00,433 --> 00:27:03,400
Your son's leaving--
this, me-- I know it.

456
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,000
No one's going anywhere.

457
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,200
Okay.

458
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,600
Here's the truth.
This is what's going on.

459
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,500
You want to believe Kara.

460
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,900
You would rather be wrong about her

461
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,700
and face your own demise
than risk losing her again.

462
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:37,900
You can stay in the room.
Get out of my head.

463
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,800
You're so afraid to live alone.

464
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,000
And you're afraid to die that way.

465
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
You're afraid that you may not be
the dying leader you thought you were.

466
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:11,500
Or that your death may be
as meaningless as everyone else's.

467
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:01,000
Zarek nominated me for
the vacant quorum spot, so I...

468
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,200
You're Zarek's wing man.

469
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,582
All right, all right,
you know, stow it, okay.

470
00:29:05,682 --> 00:29:06,900
I've heard it all before.

471
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,912
The guy's a piece of work, I know.

472
00:29:09,012 --> 00:29:11,500
His head's as bit as
the house I grew up in.

473
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:15,900
I'm-- I'm pretty new to all this.
I could use the help.

474
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:20,500
Besides, I never really
could say no to anything.

475
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,600
Except me.

476
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,300
Especially you.

477
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:34,500
You know, I think I finally understand
what you meant about having a destiny.

478
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,000
I've got to do this.

479
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,300
And the fact that I don't have
an explanation why doesn't--

480
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,800
doesn't really seem to matter anymore.

481
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,600
So say we all.

482
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,700
So say we all.

483
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,200
Good luck on your journey, Lee Adama.

484
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,600
You too, Kara Thrace.

485
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,500
- Okay.
- All right.

486
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,500
Lee.

487
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,600
I believe you.

488
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,900
Red and blue sections will go first,
yellow and green will follow.

489
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Skid's up in ten minutes.

490
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,700
Starbuck, if you've got a problem,
I don't want to hear about it.

491
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,069
My only problem is that...

492
00:31:15,169 --> 00:31:17,200
you didn't preach that
sermon a week ago.

493
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,235
Keep your ears open.

494
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:20,600
Any cylon contact has
shut down and bugged out.

495
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,230
Questions.

496
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:23,200
Yeah, when are you coming
back to the card game?

497
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,200
- We're on tomorrow night!
- Hey, all right, all right.

498
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,500
Good luck. Man, be careful out there.

499
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,800
Attention to orders!

500
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:51,600
In recognition of honorable, loyal,
and faithful service,

501
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:55,700
Madam president, admiral
of the colonial fleet,

502
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,900
Ladies and gentlemen, major Lee Adama.

503
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,900
Salute!

504
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,900
Good luck.

505
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,100
Thank you.

506
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,400
Thank you.

507
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,400
Well, it looks like you got the house.

508
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:40,300
- I'll miss you.
- Good-bye, Lee.

509
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,600
Look after yourself.

510
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,800
We want you to stop
lobotomizing the raiders, Cavil.

511
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:28,500
Raiders with free will?
Not going to happen.

512
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,100
Do you know what just
really rankles my ass?!

513
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,081
You've been pointing fingers,
falsely accusing me...

514
00:34:35,181 --> 00:34:37,200
of manipulation just short of tyranny,

515
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,100
when you're the one
that's been leading the charge here.

516
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,800
We want you to stop.

517
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:45,100
You're not in charge. We had a vote.

518
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:52,000
For the last time,
will you stop lobotomizing the raiders?

519
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,200
It's unbelievable, isn't it? 
Unbelievable.

520
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,900
For the last time...

521
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,800
No.

522
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,000
I was afraid you'd say that.

523
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,700
Come in.

524
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,100
This is cute. 
Centurions can't vote, Six.

525
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,100
Oh, they're not here to vote, Cavil.

526
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,500
- Am I hurting you?
- No.

527
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,800
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

528
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,100
What do you mean, nothing? You're crying.

529
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,600
It's just something I do during sex.

530
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:19,000
- All... all the time?
- Yeah.

531
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,000
I'm really sorry.

532
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:26,200
Don't be sorry. 
Why should you apologize?

533
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,000
You should be thankful.

534
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:34,000
You have an abundance of feeling.

535
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,200
I've never really
thought of it like that.

536
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,500
Well, I mean, you're
blessed, aren't you?

537
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:44,600
I don't know. I guess.

538
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,000
I suppose I could be a cylon.

539
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,100
Well, I don't know about that.

540
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,500
Human beings don't exclusively
hold the patent on suffering.

541
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,500
Cylons can feel.

542
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,300
- You believe that?
- Yeah, I do, actually. Yeah.

543
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,900
I've spent time amongst them.

544
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,247
Man may have made them, but God is...

545
00:37:17,347 --> 00:37:19,800
at the beginning of
the string, isn't he?

546
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:26,100
It's God who made the real soul.
The one true God.

547
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:29,000
One God?

548
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,500
The one true God.

549
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,900
You know, I'm becoming increasingly
tired of holding that in.

550
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,900
Of denying that essential truth.

551
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,800
Now, this, uh, this isn't funny.

552
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,700
Leave.

553
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,300
I said leave!

554
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,100
Why don't they leave?

555
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,919
The telencephalic inhibitor that...

556
00:38:19,019 --> 00:38:21,500
restricts higher functions
in the centurions...

557
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,800
- we had them removed.
- Say what?

558
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,305
You dumbed down the raiders.

559
00:38:25,487 --> 00:38:29,001
We the Leobens, the Sharons,
gave the centurions the gift of reason.

560
00:38:29,101 --> 00:38:32,300
You have no authority to do this. None.

561
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,400
You can't do anything without a vote!

562
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:38,400
No, we can't do anything with one,
so we're finished voting.

563
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,000
What have you done?

564
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,900
First thing they learned is
what you were doing to the raiders.

565
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,400
You can imagine how they felt.

566
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,200
Oh, no.

567
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,400
Sir, the fleet is prepped
and ready for jump.

568
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,600
Execute jump.

569
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,300
Go back!

570
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,700
Go back.

571
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,200
Cuff her.

572
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
So.

573
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,600
You quietly cut me loose in deep space.

574
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,400
I'm not afraid to die.

575
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:57,800
Little easier after you've
been through it once.

576
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,100
Harder.

577
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,300
Especially now that I'm
seeing things so clearly.

578
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,700
You're making a mistake.

579
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,700
Maybe I am.

580
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,950
But I can't take the chance...

581
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:13,400
that you're right and not
do something about it.

582
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:33,300
Helo hand-picked a crew for you.
I'm giving you a ship.

583
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,500
I hope you can stand the smell.

584
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,600
We liberated the Demetrius.

585
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,200
It's a sewage recycling ship.

586
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,278
The party line will be
that we're going...

587
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:47,600
for a scouting mission.
Looking for food.

588
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,400
So you think I'm right.

589
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,300
Maybe. Maybe not.

590
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,400
But I know she is-- the president.

591
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:01,800
She's been right all along.
I'm tired of losing.

592
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,599
I'm tired of turning
away from the things...

593
00:42:04,699 --> 00:42:05,800
that I want to believe in.

594
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:10,700
And I believe you when you say
that you'll die before you stop trying.

595
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:14,700
And I won't lose you again.

596
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,200
Now go.

597
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,500
Find a way to earth.
