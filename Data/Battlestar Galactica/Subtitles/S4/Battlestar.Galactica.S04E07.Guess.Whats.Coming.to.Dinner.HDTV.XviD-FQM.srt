1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:02,870
TWELVE CYLON MODELS

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,300
SEVEN ARE KNOWN

3
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,360
FOUR LIVE IN SECRET

4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,760
ONE WILL BE REVEALED

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,150
Previously on "Battlestar Galactica"

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,935
I'm giving you a ship. Now go.

7
00:00:26,035 --> 00:00:27,910
Find a way to Earth.

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,865
<i>Kara, I'm alone.
This is not an attack.</i>

9
00:00:30,975 --> 00:00:32,050
<i>I knew I'd find you.</i>

10
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:32,905
Leoben?

11
00:00:33,005 --> 00:00:36,315
<i>I'm here to offer a truce
between Human and Cylon</i>

12
00:00:36,415 --> 00:00:38,580
<i>and a chance for you to
complete your journey.</i>

13
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,665
The Hybrid.

14
00:00:39,765 --> 00:00:42,475
You need to go to her, Kara.

15
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:44,730
<i>She'll tell you the way
to get to Earth.</i>

16
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:45,865
We're done here.

17
00:00:45,965 --> 00:00:47,540
Get him out of here.

18
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:49,470
We're ready to jump back
to the fleet on your order.

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,675
We're not going back to the fleet.

20
00:00:50,775 --> 00:00:53,295
Captain Thrace, as XO of the Demetrius,

21
00:00:53,395 --> 00:00:55,415
I'm hereby relieving you of command.

22
00:00:55,515 --> 00:00:57,090
You son of a bitch.

23
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,180
Gaeta, abort the jump!

24
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,100
I'm gonna take Leoben
back to the baseship,

25
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,320
see if his story checks out.

26
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,230
We'll be waiting here
till the clock runs out.

27
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,130
Looks like he wasn't
lying about a civil war.

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,570
This is it.

29
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:13,625
The comet.

30
00:01:13,725 --> 00:01:14,780
It's the ship!

31
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,250
Thus will it come to pass.

32
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,715
You are the harbinger
of death, Kara Thrace.

33
00:01:18,815 --> 00:01:20,760
<i>You will lead them all to their end.</i>

34
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,645
<i>Cylon baseship.</i>

35
00:01:24,745 --> 00:01:25,900
<i>Demetrius, Athena.</i>

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,220
The baseship is ours.

37
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,660
Then let's go home.

38
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,405
<i>Now I have learned from
unimpeachable sources</i>

39
00:01:37,505 --> 00:01:40,190
<i>that President Laura Roslin
has for some time now</i>

40
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:45,625
<i>been sharing hallucinogenic visions
with two Cylons within our fleet:</i>

41
00:01:45,725 --> 00:01:49,965
<i>One Sharon Agathon, sent on the
classified Demetrius mission,</i>

42
00:01:50,065 --> 00:01:52,890
<i>and the other a Cylon prisoner
being held aboard the Galac--</i>

43
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,375
It's not that easy, Madam President.

44
00:01:56,475 --> 00:01:57,755
No? You should try it sometime.

45
00:01:57,855 --> 00:01:59,615
Most of the population
has heard that broadcast.

46
00:01:59,715 --> 00:02:01,770
I would assume that's the point.

47
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,730
Look, I take no pleasure in
putting this before you.

48
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,845
In fact, they practically had
to push me through that door.

49
00:02:07,945 --> 00:02:09,570
Well, I'm sure you're
quite happy to stay.

50
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,235
I can't put one foot in front of another

51
00:02:11,335 --> 00:02:15,730
without someone blocking my path,
asking me what the hell is going on!

52
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,065
- For the welfare of the fleet...
- Excuse me.

53
00:02:18,165 --> 00:02:20,035
As long as I am in this office,

54
00:02:20,135 --> 00:02:25,405
the welfare of this fleet is not
something you need to worry about.

55
00:02:25,505 --> 00:02:27,920
You owe the people a response.

56
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,870
I owe the people?

57
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,160
That's what I believe.

58
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,155
What if suddenly all your beliefs
were called into question?

59
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:35,915
- Madam President...
- Up is down,

60
00:02:36,015 --> 00:02:36,725
black is white,

61
00:02:36,825 --> 00:02:38,275
scripture is fiction.

62
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:41,545
Home is thin air instead
of solid ground, etcetera.

63
00:02:41,645 --> 00:02:44,815
You know, I'm really sorry for
everything you've had to endure.

64
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:45,970
I really am.

65
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,715
But the people, they deserve a response.

66
00:02:48,815 --> 00:02:49,445
Do they?

67
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:51,735
Is there any truth to this broadcast?

68
00:02:51,835 --> 00:02:54,500
And what would you do if
I told you the truth?

69
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,505
What if it were you instead of me

70
00:02:56,605 --> 00:03:00,050
and all that's left of
humanity has just been told

71
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,800
that you are sharing
visions with the enemy?

72
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,220
What would you do, Mr. Adama?

73
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,200
Would you think that the
gods were testing you?

74
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:10,040
So Baltar is telling the truth?

75
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,690
Is it true?

76
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,260
Yes.

77
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,310
Demetrius reports their sys ops will
be synced with ours in five minutes.

78
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,435
When you came knocking with that
raider and asked for our help,

79
00:03:38,535 --> 00:03:40,605
you gave away the future of all
the Cylons aboard this ship.

80
00:03:40,705 --> 00:03:41,305
You know that, right?

81
00:03:41,405 --> 00:03:42,520
I gave it to the right person.

82
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,335
Save it.

83
00:03:43,435 --> 00:03:44,890
No guarantees.

84
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,025
When we meet up with the colonial fleet,

85
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,630
I don't know if they'll feed
you or frak you, all right?

86
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,850
Since you've been calling
the plays up till now,

87
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,930
I'm assuming you're doing the talking.

88
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,190
Good.

89
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,310
Gods help us.

90
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,730
Sys ops of both vessels are synced.

91
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,580
We're as ready as we're ever gonna be.

92
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,425
Good.

93
00:04:10,525 --> 00:04:12,040
Tell the Demetrius to
set the board to green.

94
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:15,860
Unless both ships jump in together,
Galactica will blow us out of the sky.

95
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,250
<i>Demetrius, Athena.</i>

96
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,820
<i>Set your board to green.</i>

97
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,240
Athena, Demetrius. 
Starting to green.

98
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,425
Let's run the horn, guys.

99
00:04:40,525 --> 00:04:42,155
- Sublight.
- Go.

100
00:04:42,255 --> 00:04:44,525
- Helm.
- Go.

101
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,565
- Tactical.
- Go.

102
00:04:46,665 --> 00:04:48,775
- Nav.
- Go.

103
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,010
FTL.

104
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,870
Spun up. Go.

105
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,035
Athena, Demetrius.

106
00:04:54,135 --> 00:04:55,360
<i>Board is green.</i>

107
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,320
I was just thinking how
beautiful she must be.

108
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,730
Your daughter, Hera.

109
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,725
How do you know her name?

110
00:05:07,825 --> 00:05:09,430
We all know her name.

111
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:10,990
You were blessed.

112
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,955
All right, everyone.

113
00:05:14,055 --> 00:05:15,360
Let's go home.

114
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,335
Demetrius, Athena.

115
00:05:18,435 --> 00:05:19,700
<i>Execute jump.</i>

116
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,950
Clock is running.

117
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,105
10, 

118
00:05:23,555 --> 00:05:24,197
9,

119
00:05:24,747 --> 00:05:26,053
 8, 

120
00:05:26,203 --> 00:05:27,173
7, 

121
00:05:27,623 --> 00:05:28,589
6, 

122
00:05:28,739 --> 00:05:29,701

123
00:05:30,351 --> 00:05:31,307

124
00:05:32,057 --> 00:05:33,006
3, 

125
00:05:33,056 --> 00:05:33,766
2.

126
00:05:34,116 --> 00:05:35,930
Jump.

127
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,210
Sir, we had a problem with the sync
points and the jump coordinates.

128
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:47,420
It'll take a few minutes to
spool up the FTL drive again.

129
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,560
Gods damn it!

130
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,430
<i>All hands. Battle stations!</i>

131
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,730
Set condition one throughout the fleet!

132
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,740
<i>Launch alert five.</i>

133
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,825
Get me some more frakkin'
birds in the air!

134
00:06:05,925 --> 00:06:09,510
Gun batteries stand by
for target bearing!

135
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,530
Demetrius, Athena. Report.

136
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,780
Demetrius, Athena. Report.

137
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:26,195
Baseship bearing 3-3-3
carom 4-9-8 at 15 msu.

138
00:06:26,295 --> 00:06:28,035
Frakkin' thing is sitting
right on top of us.

139
00:06:28,135 --> 00:06:31,135
Mr. Hoshi, order the fleet
to make an emergency jump!

140
00:06:31,235 --> 00:06:33,472
<i>Aye, sir.
All colonial vessels jump immediately</i>

141
00:06:33,522 --> 00:06:35,230
<i>to emergency rendezvous coordinates.</i>

142
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,480
<i>Sir, the President's
shuttle is en route.</i>

143
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,165
<i>Tell them to land on landing bay 1,
checkers green.</i>

144
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,430
Galactica, Athena.

145
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,110
Galactica, Athena.

146
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,715
<i>Last jump must've cooked the wireless.
We've got no com.</i>

147
00:06:53,845 --> 00:06:54,695
They can't hear us.

148
00:06:54,795 --> 00:06:56,130
Frak.

149
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,505
Galactica's scrambling vipers.

150
00:07:05,605 --> 00:07:07,050
They're going to shoot us down.

151
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,690
What the frak?

152
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,680
<i>Eight vipers inbound.</i>

153
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,175
<i>Entering firing range.</i>

154
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:22,920
<i>Where the hell is the Demetrius?</i>

155
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,385
<i>Baseship targeted.
Weapons free.</i>

156
00:07:28,485 --> 00:07:29,915
Something isn't right.

157
00:07:30,015 --> 00:07:32,325
<i>Gunnery reporting,
firing solution correct.</i>

158
00:07:32,425 --> 00:07:35,040
<i>Main battery standing by
to fire on your command.</i>

159
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:41,049
On my command. 3, 2, 1.

160
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,560
Weapons hold!

161
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,280
<i>DRADIS contact!</i>

162
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,865
<i>Galactica, Demetrius.
Do not fire.</i>

163
00:07:58,965 --> 00:08:02,930
<i>Baseship is disarmed and under
colonial command. Officers aboard.</i>

164
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,975
Demetrius, Galactica.

165
00:08:05,075 --> 00:08:06,540
Authenticate.

00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,055
<i>Galactica, Demetrius.</i>

167
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:09,985
I authenticate.

168
00:08:10,085 --> 00:08:11,675
Bravo Tango 8.

169
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,675
Do not fire.

170
00:08:12,775 --> 00:08:15,290

Lieutenant Gaeta, stay with us.

181
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,865
All right, everybody. Stand back.

182
00:10:15,965 --> 00:10:18,280
And get a cut down tray
in here right now.

183
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,715
We became divided according to models.

184
00:10:22,815 --> 00:10:27,525
The Twos, Eights, and
Sixes have come to believe

185
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:30,560
that our destiny lies in
seeking out the Final Five.

186
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:34,655
The Ones, Fours, and Fives
violently opposed such action.

187
00:10:34,755 --> 00:10:37,555
We know that there are seven
different models of Cylons.

188
00:10:37,655 --> 00:10:39,685
You only mentioned six.

189
00:10:39,785 --> 00:10:40,945
The Threes,

190
00:10:41,045 --> 00:10:42,185
the D'Annas.

191
00:10:42,285 --> 00:10:44,450
They were boxed after the
battle on the algae planet.

192
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,430
Boxed?

193
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:48,215
Her entire line was
punitively deactivated.

194
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:52,755
Her consciousness placed
in a boxing facility.

195
00:10:52,855 --> 00:10:54,790
Why?

196
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,665
D'Anna saw the faces of the
Final Five, which was forbidden.

197
00:10:58,765 --> 00:11:03,460
But if we unbox her, she can
reveal their identities to us.

198
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,150
<i>The Final Five have been to Earth.</i>

199
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,870
If we help find them, 
they can help us get there.

200
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,275
<i>Our ship can heal itself,</i>

201
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:15,030
<i>but most of our raiders were
destroyed in the ambush.</i>

202
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,715
We're asking for your help here. 
We can't do it alone.

203
00:11:17,815 --> 00:11:19,975
What could possibly motivate
us to trust you now?

204
00:11:20,075 --> 00:11:21,780
What have you got?

205
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:28,550
The boxing facility resides within
the Cylon resurrection hub.

206
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:33,255
This hub controls the functions of
every resurrection ship in existence.

207
00:11:33,355 --> 00:11:36,505
And it protects itself by periodically
jumping to a new set of coordinates

208
00:11:36,605 --> 00:11:38,695
and then relaying them
back to the baseship.

209
00:11:38,795 --> 00:11:44,400
Madam President, you asked
for a reason to help us.

210
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,410
Vengeance.

211
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:53,250
You destroy the hub, Cylons
lose their ability to download.

212
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,920
All of us.

213
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:01,520
Why would you be willing to
lose your ability to resurrect?

214
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,270
We're rebels.

215
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,430
We can't go back.

216
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:10,260
What matters most to us
is being with the Five.

217
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,710
D'Anna will be able to identify them.

218
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:18,350
We'll take you to the hub if
you help us unbox D'Anna.

219
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,695
Give us the coordinates
of the hub first.

220
00:12:23,795 --> 00:12:24,455
No, I won't do that.

221
00:12:24,555 --> 00:12:26,670
I said we would take you there.

222
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,470
Take her out. We're finished.

223
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,640
Wait.

224
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,400
Is your word good, Admiral?

225
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,735
I'll give you the coordinates.

226
00:12:34,835 --> 00:12:35,815
<i>But I want your word.</i>

227
00:12:35,915 --> 00:12:37,180
Stand down.

228
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:43,100
You have my word.

229
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,070
Once their identities are
revealed and we come back here,

230
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:51,760
we'll be free to leave
your fleet with the Five.

231
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,550
Yes.

232
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,740
They're here with you.

233
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,555
The Final Five are in your fleet.

234
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:05,490
<i>That's why our raiders turned
back the attack in the nebula.</i>

235
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,490
The weapons hold.

236
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,960
How the frak did you see that?

237
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:22,500
To be absolutely honest
with you, Bill, I didn't.

238
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,140
What can I say? We got lucky.

239
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:36,475
Well, let's get a raptor up to those
coordinates that that Cylon gave us.

240
00:13:36,575 --> 00:13:38,240
Maybe we can get lucky again.

241
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,500
Sir.

242
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,390
Tigh.

243
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,950
<i>Thank you.</i>

244
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:02,960
<i>Lords of Kobal,
shield your eyes.</i>

245
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,590
Get it with the gun camera.

246
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,080
Hit override.

247
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,950
Kinda pretty, isn't it?

248
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,400
Tell it to the fleet.

249
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,505
No. No. Don't put me under.
Please.

250
00:14:37,605 --> 00:14:40,395
Just...just numb everything.

251
00:14:40,495 --> 00:14:42,260
- Felix...
- Just do it.

252
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:47,720
I-I don't want to wake up... I don't
want to wake up with my leg gone.

253
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,740
Okay, son.

254
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,755
If we go in on our own horse,
we won't last five minutes.

255
00:15:40,855 --> 00:15:43,235
But we go in with that
baseship parked out there,

256
00:15:43,335 --> 00:15:44,650
nobody's gonna notice us for a while.

257
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,030
What do we fight with?
Their raiders are frakked.

258
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:47,975
We don't use theirs.

259
00:15:48,075 --> 00:15:49,210
We use ours.

260
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,595
Take half the viper wing.

261
00:15:50,695 --> 00:15:52,235
- Half the wing?
<i>- Yes.</i>

262
00:15:52,335 --> 00:15:54,280
<i>We'll sneak them in on
the rebel baseship.</i>

263
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,925
Hoshi did some calculations
from Racetrack's photos.

264
00:15:57,025 --> 00:15:59,475
<i>We take out the FTL
and the hub's stranded.</i>

265
00:15:59,575 --> 00:16:04,790
We blow the hub and, uh, billions of
skin jobs lose their bath privileges.

266
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:06,280
<i>Imagine.</i>

267
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:09,505
Once they're gone,
they can't come back.

268
00:16:09,605 --> 00:16:11,935
<i>Mortal enemies.</i>

269
00:16:12,035 --> 00:16:15,960
Before we blow the hub, we need
to get a team in to unbox D'Anna.

270
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:19,220
Well, now, maybe we just don't.

271
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,485
Maybe we just forget the
godsdamn boxing facility.

272
00:16:22,585 --> 00:16:23,565
Lie to the rebels.

273
00:16:23,665 --> 00:16:25,750
<i>Well, they're lying to us.</i>

274
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:30,450
<i>The skin jobs said their raiders won't
fight because the Final Five is here?</i>

275
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:34,910
We tangled with those slit-eyed
black bastards for three years now,

276
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,260
and they haven't turned
back before. Why now?

277
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:38,945
What if they're telling the truth?

278
00:16:39,045 --> 00:16:40,695
What if the Final Five are here?

279
00:16:40,795 --> 00:16:42,560
The Five could know the way to Earth.

280
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,265
If they knew, they're
not gonna lead us there

281
00:16:44,365 --> 00:16:47,175
after we've just destroyed
their resurrection capacity.

282
00:16:47,275 --> 00:16:49,240
Maybe they're different,
like the rebels.

283
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,580
<i>What if they're not?</i>

284
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,150
<i>What if their sole
purpose is to destroy us?</i>

285
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:56,530
I say we blow the whole
godsdamn thing to dust...

286
00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:00,260
lock, stock, and barrel... and
trust the President's vision,

287
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,270
her scriptures, her way to Earth.

288
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,130
Why don't we split the difference?

289
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,225
<i>Unbox D'Anna and find the Five.</i>

290
00:17:07,325 --> 00:17:08,475
Keep the Five till we get to Earth,

291
00:17:08,575 --> 00:17:09,525
turn them over to the rebels.

292
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,065
They've waited this long.

293
00:17:11,165 --> 00:17:13,070
It'll be on our terms.

294
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,588
It's all pie in the sky, gentlemen,

295
00:17:15,688 --> 00:17:18,705
until we know what's
true and what's not.

296
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:20,355
And we put a lid on it.

297
00:17:20,755 --> 00:17:22,540
The real plan stays in this room.

298
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,010
If the plan gets leaked to
the Cylons, all bets are off.

299
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:28,705
<i>Have someone escort the rebel
leader back to her baseship</i>

300
00:17:28,805 --> 00:17:32,240
<i>so she can inform her
people they have a deal.</i>

301
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:05,420
"In 36 hours, the colonies will unite
forces with insurgent rebel Cylons

302
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,210
"and their leader

303
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,530
"in an unprecedented
joint military operation

304
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:16,150
"to destroy the Cylons'
ability to download into..."

305
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,210
Blah blah blah.

306
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:25,030
Why weren't we consulted?

307
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,050
I'm sorry.

308
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,200
I'm in the dark as much as all of you.

309
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,553
You know, if they unbox
the D'Annas,

310
00:18:39,653 --> 00:18:41,805
at least we'll find out
who the fifth one is.

311
00:18:41,905 --> 00:18:44,455
All that's gonna do is
crowd the airlock a little more.

312
00:18:44,555 --> 00:18:48,460
Do you think they're gonna give you a
medal when they find out who you are?

313
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,690
What about you?

314
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,530
He sings, you know.

315
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,920
- What?
<i>- Gaeta.</i>

316
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,975
Whenever he feels the tingling,

317
00:18:59,075 --> 00:19:01,280
whenever he feels his phantom leg.

318
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:04,390
Cottle says it helps him get through it.

319
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:13,400
He sings.

320
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,120
Good morning.

321
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,630
Morning.

322
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:33,015
What is it about the Galactica
that gives you such a glow?

323
00:19:33,115 --> 00:19:36,380
I come over here, it's like I'm
going from one dungeon to the next.

324
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,565
Oh, I hadn't noticed,
but thank you.

325
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,515
You ready?

326
00:19:39,615 --> 00:19:40,685
Yes.

327
00:19:40,785 --> 00:19:44,025
I want you to find out who's
behind the shared vision rumors.

328
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:45,860
Who's talking to him?

329
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,015
With Baltar?

330
00:19:47,115 --> 00:19:49,060
You're sleeping with him, right?

331
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,000
<i>Don't.</i>

332
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,075
I've just been informed that
you've been spotted down there

333
00:19:59,175 --> 00:20:03,520
enough times to be a charter
member of his nymph squad.

334
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,590
All right.

335
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:19,335
I have come to believe in
Baltar's spiritual message.

336
00:20:19,435 --> 00:20:22,010
<i>I don't know how or why.
It just happened.</i>

337
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,510
I wish you knew how many
times I wanted to tell you.

338
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:29,780
Your friendship and your
trust means--

339
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,380
Frak.

340
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:37,335
Clearly my friendship
and trust mean frak.

341
00:20:37,435 --> 00:20:39,785
<i>And I don't really care if
you have to spend the night</i>

342
00:20:39,885 --> 00:20:42,580
on your knees praying
or just on your knees.

343
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:43,605
I want a name.

344
00:20:43,705 --> 00:20:48,000
I want to know who's
responsible for these lies.

345
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,320
Madam President.

346
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:58,760
Laura, I am so sorry.

347
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,820
You have a job to do.

348
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,982
The humans are never
going to allow us

349
00:21:18,082 --> 00:21:19,780
to have the Final Five
and go our own way.

350
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,175
Are you sure of this?

351
00:21:22,275 --> 00:21:23,800
Not entirely.

352
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:26,860
I'd rather be wrong,
but we need insurance.

353
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:31,065
Trust has to begin somewhere.

354
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:32,810
Not with us.

355
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,230
It's our ship.

356
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:40,300
When we jump, we take control
of it with the centurions.

357
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,765
We carry out the
mission as promised,

358
00:21:42,865 --> 00:21:47,955
but when we return,
we take hostages.

359
00:21:48,055 --> 00:21:52,190
The humans on this ship stay on
this ship until we have the Five.

360
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,270
Look at me.

361
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,160
We've changed,
but the humans haven't.

362
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:02,310
We've come too far to risk
everything on their trust.

363
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:20,134
<i># Alone she sleeps in the
shirt of man with...</i>

364
00:22:20,234 --> 00:22:26,920
# my three wishes clutched in her hand.

365
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:37,700
<i># The first that she be spared
the pain that comes from a dark</i>

366
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,706
<i># and laughing reign.</i> 

367
00:22:43,556 --> 00:22:49,565
<i># When she finds love,
may it always stay true...</i>

368
00:22:49,665 --> 00:22:52,610
<i>What a way to discover such
a beautiful voice, huh?</i>

369
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,370
How'd you find me?

370
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,560
Your chief of staff.

371
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,495
...needs to be horsewhipped.

372
00:23:00,595 --> 00:23:04,420
If you came down here to kiss my ass
to get information, save your breath.

373
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:09,280
The quorum's considering a vote
of no confidence against you.

374
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,610
I won't compromise the
success of this operation

375
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:23,561
or the safety of this fleet
to indulge the neediness

376
00:23:23,661 --> 00:23:27,265
of twelve perpetually 
unhappy representatives.

377
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:29,050
I can't.

378
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:43,250
I was with them on the,
uh, emergency jump.

379
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:47,355
And I saw something in the
faces of the delegates.

380
00:23:47,455 --> 00:23:50,225
It wasn't the anxiety from waiting,
it went beyond that.

381
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,770
I was anxious,
it was my first time.

382
00:23:51,835 --> 00:23:53,540
But they...they...

383
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,490
they were empty.

384
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,945
The quorum had given up.

385
00:24:01,045 --> 00:24:09,070
And then it struck me that after going
through the same routine so many times,

386
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:15,960
it was the only way that they
could cope with the uncertainty.

387
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,600
To presume the worst.

388
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,880
You felt their suffering.

389
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:30,100
Now try holding their
lives in balance every day.

390
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,480
Talk to them.

391
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,090
You don't have to tell them everything.

392
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,230
I know how it works.

393
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:40,145
<i>Just talk to the quorum.</i>

394
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:43,605
Let them put a face to
this joint mission.

395
00:24:43,705 --> 00:24:45,710
Let them hear from the Cylon leader.

396
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,100
Anything.

397
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,260
<i>Anything to put their fears to rest.</i>

398
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:04,090
What's the matter?

399
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,275
- Nothing.
- No, nothing.

400
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:09,295
Nothing at all.

401
00:25:09,395 --> 00:25:11,935
We've been lying here,
doing nothing.

402
00:25:12,035 --> 00:25:13,470
What?

403
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,320
You've been lying about the President
sharing visions with Cylons.

404
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:27,555
That happens to be the
God's honest truth.

405
00:25:27,655 --> 00:25:28,560
Sorry.

406
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:30,360
I can't accept what you've done.

407
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:32,040
What...what I've done?

408
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:33,505
What have I...?

409
00:25:33,605 --> 00:25:35,675
What are--?

410
00:25:38,725 --> 00:25:40,360
Where's this coming from?

411
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,840
These rumors you've started.

412
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,360
I've seen what they've done to her.

413
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:51,410
You seriously believe that
I'm making all this up?

414
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:55,050
I am not saying I'm not
capable, but why would I?

415
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,670
Six revealed it.

416
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:11,680
Caprica Six revealed them
to me through my attorney

417
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:19,580
in the last days of my trial, when
a guilty verdict was a certainty.

418
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,290
I suppose I could've gone public.

419
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:26,580
- Caused a stir.
- And all this time, you kept quiet.

420
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,390
<i>I'm not saying I'm a saint, Tory.</i>

421
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:35,780
<i>I'm many things.</i>

422
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,240
But I try not to be spiteful.

423
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:42,390
Got no bloodlust to go get her.

424
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:44,320
But she's a hypocrite.

425
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,780
The lies.

426
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:49,300
The secret missions.

427
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,521
Co-opting the rhetoric
of patriotism

428
00:26:51,621 --> 00:26:54,110
to keep everyone in the
dark, including you.

429
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,570
That's rather worrying, isn't it?

430
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,730
So I had to speak.

431
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:11,020
The truth is, no good ever
comes from concealing it.

432
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,730
I've got a broadcast.

433
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:23,268
<i># The first that she
be spared the pain...

434
00:27:23,368 --> 00:27:30,080
# that comes from a dark
and laughing reign.

435
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:43,420
# When she finds love,
may it always stay true.

436
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:51,200
# This I beg for the
second wish I made, too.

437
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:58,295
I didn't come here to beg or plead
or apologize or to keep my job.

438
00:27:58,395 --> 00:27:59,760
You know me better than that.

439
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,741
And I didn't come here
to create sympathy

440
00:28:01,941 --> 00:28:03,890
by parading my illness
in front of you.

441
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,255
<i>On the contrary,
there are some</i>

442
00:28:06,355 --> 00:28:10,060
<i>that probably believe that
along with my cancer and drugs,</i>

443
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:13,720
I have inoculated myself
against compassion.

444
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,670
That is a joke.

445
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:22,855
I am here because I want
to tell you face to face

446
00:28:22,955 --> 00:28:26,720
that I believe in this mission
and what it means for our future.

447
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:32,040
I'm here to profess my
trust in our new allies.

448
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,510
I'm here to ask you to listen.

449
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,740
I'm here to ask for your support.

450
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,060
Bring her in.

451
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:18,500
In our civil war, we've seen death.

452
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,970
We've watched our people die.

453
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,355
Gone forever.

454
00:29:22,455 --> 00:29:26,800
As terrible as it was beyond the
reach of the resurrection ships,

455
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,850
something began to change.

456
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:39,360
We could feel a sense of time, as if
each moment held its own significance.

457
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:44,833
We began to realize that for
our existence to hold any value,

458
00:29:45,433 --> 00:29:46,805
it must end.

459
00:29:47,605 --> 00:29:52,990
To live meaningful lives,
we must die and not return.

460
00:29:54,310 --> 00:30:00,120
The one human flaw that you spend
your lifetimes distressing over...

461
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:07,480
mortality... is the one thing...

462
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,380
Well, it's the one thing
that makes you whole.

463
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:17,050
I believe it was no accident that
we were found by Kara Thrace.

464
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,880
It was destiny.

465
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,450
She asked me to leave my
people, and I accepted.

466
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:26,960
No matter what the sacrifice,
<i>even if it should mean my death.</i>

467
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,125
<i>Thus shall it come to pass.</i>

468
00:30:28,225 --> 00:30:30,835
<i>The dying leader shall know
the truth of the opera house.</i>

469
00:30:30,935 --> 00:30:33,580
<i>You are the harbinger
of death, Kara Thrace.</i>

470
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,300
<i>Our destiny,</i>

471
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,140
our future...

472
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,320
begins here.

473
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:58,890
Thank you for giving me
the opportunity to speak.

474
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,510
Take her out.

475
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:13,978
# But wish no more, my life
you can take

476
00:31:14,078 --> 00:31:24,180
# to have her, please. Just one
day wake to have her, please.

477
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:37,555
# Alone she sleeps 
in the shirt of man

478
00:31:37,655 --> 00:31:42,290
<i># with my three wishes
clutched in her hand...</i>

479
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,580
Hera!

480
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,740
Hera.

481
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,360
Bye-bye.

482
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:13,445
I gotta hand it to you.

483
00:33:13,545 --> 00:33:16,860
If you are a Cylon,
that was a great plan.

484
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,235
<i>Dangle yet another way to Earth.</i>

485
00:33:19,335 --> 00:33:22,385
Throw in the hub, the Final
Five, and the real kicker,

486
00:33:22,485 --> 00:33:24,465
put the Final Five on the fleet.

487
00:33:24,565 --> 00:33:27,090
Even I couldn't pass that one up.

488
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,410
You are having those
visions, aren't you?

489
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,980
"Thus shall it come to pass.

490
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:45,970
"The dying leader shall know
the truth of the opera house."

491
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,320
What did you say?

492
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,055
"Thus shall it come to pass."

493
00:33:54,155 --> 00:33:55,980
The opera house.

494
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:59,620
"The dying leader shall know
the truth of the opera house."

495
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,275
Where did--?
Where did you hear that?

496
00:34:05,375 --> 00:34:07,070
Who told you that?

497
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:10,500
The Hybrid from the baseship
before they unplugged it.

498
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,040
The Hybrid.

499
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:16,410
How does the Hybrid know
what's in my dream?

500
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,590
I wish I knew.

501
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,240
This has got to stop.

502
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:29,505
These visions.

503
00:34:29,605 --> 00:34:32,400
I've got to find out
about these visions.

504
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,190
I've got to know.

505
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:41,040
Will you help me?

506
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,070
Yes.

507
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:50,220
Find Captain Agathon.

508
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:58,245
When I spoke to the
quorum, I could feel it.

509
00:34:58,345 --> 00:34:59,835
<i>The contempt.</i>

510
00:34:59,935 --> 00:35:01,260
You were right.

511
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:03,620
They're not ready to trust us.

512
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,080
No, I was wrong.

513
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:07,310
We're not ready.

514
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,340
We're deceiving them.

515
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:11,010
For protection.

516
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:12,145
For necessity.

517
00:35:12,245 --> 00:35:14,850
Out of suspicion and fear.

518
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:17,990
Why haven't the Final Five come forward?

519
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:21,485
What if they're watching,
judging us on our actions?

520
00:35:21,585 --> 00:35:25,640
We're about to resort to
violence and coercion.

521
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,590
What if they refuse to come with us?

522
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:30,800
We can't do this.

523
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,110
It's too late.

524
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:39,360
We have to order the
centurions to stand down.

525
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,970
It's too late.

526
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,260
They're committed.

527
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,770
Then we have to tell
the humans the truth.

528
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:49,010
No, you can't do that.

529
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:51,260
They'll never trust us again.

530
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,385
They already know the coordinates.

531
00:35:52,485 --> 00:35:54,790
They'll just go destroy everything.

532
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:56,500
Go.

533
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:58,940
Stall for time.

534
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,735
Talk to Adama.

535
00:36:00,835 --> 00:36:02,480
Tell them anything.

536
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:04,005
Anything but the truth.

537
00:36:04,205 --> 00:36:06,320
I'll deal with the centurions.

538
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,715
<i>Of course.</i>

539
00:36:40,815 --> 00:36:42,130
<i>Have a seat.</i>

540
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:49,300
We're going to settle this now.

541
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,050
What's to settle?

542
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:54,060
Your chief of staff is
incomparably talented.

543
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:58,470
I've been sharing visions with
Sharon Agathon and the Six.

544
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:02,040
So I was only speaking the truth.

545
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:03,650
Yes.

546
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:09,490
<i>The Hybrid on the baseship spoke of
an opera house and a dying leader.</i>

547
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:12,440
We're going to talk to the Hybrid.

548
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,715
And why would you require my presence?

549
00:37:15,515 --> 00:37:18,130
Because you're in my visions.

550
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,680
What are you doin', baby?

551
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,480
Are you drawing?

552
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,700
Can I see what you drew?

553
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,130
Oh, no.

554
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:10,460
No!

555
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,230
Why?

556
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:16,880
Why?

557
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,910
Why?

558
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:21,330
Hera?

559
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:24,010
Hera?

560
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,010
Hera!

561
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:53,870
<i>Raptor 1-2-4, you are
cleared for landing. Approaching...</i>

562
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,050
Hera?

563
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:20,280
Hera!

564
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,840
Hera!

565
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,460
Have you seen my daughter?

566
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,880
No, I haven't.

567
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,280
Hera!

568
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:28,560
Hera!

569
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:45,880
Hera!

570
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:50,420
Hera?

571
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,150
I can't find Hera.

572
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:58,060
Hera!

573
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:42,860
Get away from my child.

574
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:46,305
Get your hands off of my child!

575
00:40:46,405 --> 00:40:47,560
Athena.

576
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,960
Stay back!

577
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:51,960
Stay away.

578
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:53,890
Stand down!

579
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,650
Plug it in.

580
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:13,000
<i>I need to talk to it.</i>

581
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,040
Let God's will be done.

582
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,490
Shut up.

583
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:21,400
<i>It's time to get some answers.</i>

584
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:30,280
Tyrol, will you come in
here and take Hera, please?

585
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,230
Just do it, Tyrol.

586
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,600
Is she gone?

587
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,620
Yeah.

588
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,425
You are never gonna take my child.

589
00:42:13,525 --> 00:42:15,330
We didn't come here to.

590
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:31,250
Jump!

591
00:42:34,445 --> 00:42:42,175
<i># To have her, please
just one day wake</i>

592
00:42:43,375 --> 00:42:55,260
# to have her,
please just one day wake...
