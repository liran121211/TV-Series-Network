1
00:00:00,996 --> 00:00:03,216
Twelve Cylon models

2
00:00:05,286 --> 00:00:08,616
Seven are known

3
00:00:11,446 --> 00:00:14,626
Four live in secret

4
00:00:17,206 --> 00:00:20,126
One will be revealed

5
00:00:20,906 --> 00:00:23,376
Previously on Battlestar Galactica.

6
00:00:24,726 --> 00:00:28,616
I think the nova does look like
the mandala inside this temple.

7
00:00:28,716 --> 00:00:32,366
Maybe it was a road sign
on the path to Earth.

8
00:00:32,996 --> 00:00:34,046
It was on the temple.

9
00:00:34,146 --> 00:00:35,651
But where'd you get the
idea to paint yours?

10
00:00:35,751 --> 00:00:38,286
It was just something I've been
doodling since I was a kid.

11
00:00:38,386 --> 00:00:39,566
I liked the pattern.

12
00:00:40,836 --> 00:00:42,221
Starbuck, you're getting too low.

13
00:00:42,321 --> 00:00:43,981
Come on, Lee. Get her out of there.

14
00:00:44,081 --> 00:00:44,921
You come back!

15
00:00:45,021 --> 00:00:46,101
Just let me go.

16
00:00:46,202 --> 00:00:47,256
They're waiting for me.

17
00:00:49,806 --> 00:00:51,136
No!

18
00:00:53,106 --> 00:00:56,306
Gaius Baltar, after carefully
weighing the evidence,

19
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:58,496
this tribunal finds you not guilty.

20
00:01:00,176 --> 00:01:00,962
Get him back!

21
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,666
Get him out of here!
Get him out of here!

22
00:01:04,207 --> 00:01:05,462
Gaius, it's okay.

23
00:01:05,561 --> 00:01:06,111
Come with me.

24
00:01:06,212 --> 00:01:06,952
Where are you taking me to?

25
00:01:07,051 --> 00:01:08,006
To your new life.

26
00:01:10,376 --> 00:01:12,522
We're going to the Ionian nebula.

27
00:01:12,621 --> 00:01:14,962
- Sitrep!
- Sensors show major power fluctuations.

28
00:01:15,061 --> 00:01:16,066
Checking on fleet.

29
00:01:21,097 --> 00:01:21,952
It's true.

30
00:01:22,051 --> 00:01:23,426
We're Cylons.

31
00:01:24,406 --> 00:01:26,027
And we have been from the start.

32
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:29,506
Dradis contact!

33
00:01:29,647 --> 00:01:31,481
Massive Cylon fleet on intercept course.

34
00:01:31,881 --> 00:01:33,772
I want emergency jump, the entire fleet.

35
00:01:34,071 --> 00:01:37,281
Sir, all fleet ships were powered
down during the outage.

36
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:40,202
It'll take at least 20 minutes to
spool up the FTL drives.

37
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:42,306
We just don't have 20 minutes.

38
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:43,281
Action stations.

39
00:01:43,381 --> 00:01:44,411
Set condition one throughout the ship.

40
00:01:44,511 --> 00:01:44,931
This is not a drill.

41
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:47,306
All viper pilots report
to vipers immediately.

42
00:01:47,616 --> 00:01:49,077
I have a bogey at my ten.

43
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:50,306
I'm gonna go check it out.

44
00:01:52,077 --> 00:01:53,886
Whoa! What the frak?

45
00:02:00,476 --> 00:02:01,431
Hi, Lee.

46
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:02,511
Kara?

47
00:02:02,611 --> 00:02:03,866
I've been to Earth.

48
00:02:04,486 --> 00:02:05,847
I know where it is.

49
00:02:06,467 --> 00:02:07,866
And I'm gonna take us there.

50
00:02:29,986 --> 00:02:30,876
No.

51
00:02:31,327 --> 00:02:33,506
No, no, this is frakkin' crazy.

52
00:02:33,647 --> 00:02:35,601
I saw your ship blow up.

53
00:02:35,702 --> 00:02:36,906
Afraid not.

54
00:02:37,827 --> 00:02:39,386
Did you not hear me?

55
00:02:39,486 --> 00:02:41,131
I've been to Earth.

56
00:02:41,231 --> 00:02:42,136
Earth.

57
00:02:42,926 --> 00:02:45,436
Big blue oceans, fluffy white clouds.

58
00:02:45,536 --> 00:02:46,816
You're gonna love it.

59
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,207
I promise.

60
00:02:50,226 --> 00:02:52,191
Identify that ship immediately.

61
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,286
Sir, I'm checking for
colonial recognition codes.

62
00:02:54,397 --> 00:02:55,207
Get Lee online!

63
00:02:55,306 --> 00:02:56,467
I'm trying, sir.

64
00:02:56,566 --> 00:02:58,031
I'm picking up her ship's signature.

65
00:02:58,131 --> 00:02:59,681
- That's her voice all right.
- Hold on, hold on.

66
00:02:59,781 --> 00:03:01,241
It is not real. It is a trick.

67
00:03:01,342 --> 00:03:03,166
- Duplicate verification.
- Checking.

68
00:03:11,796 --> 00:03:13,921
Hostiles inbound!
200 plus!

69
00:03:14,022 --> 00:03:14,751
Cag, take 'em out!

70
00:03:14,851 --> 00:03:16,392
All players, Galactica.

71
00:03:16,491 --> 00:03:19,926
Threat b-r-3-5-0 carom 2-1-1.

72
00:03:20,036 --> 00:03:21,626
Raptors, lean back as missile pickets.

73
00:03:21,726 --> 00:03:22,526
Weapons free.

74
00:03:22,626 --> 00:03:24,467
Don't lose me this time, Apollo.

75
00:03:25,656 --> 00:03:26,996
Oh, not a chance.

76
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:34,536
Splash one!

77
00:03:36,496 --> 00:03:38,097
Take that, you frakkin' toasters!

78
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:39,986
Admiral, it's a Cylon trick.

79
00:03:49,686 --> 00:03:51,916
The vipers have stopped
the main Cylon thrust,

80
00:03:52,017 --> 00:03:53,376
But the reserves have
broken through, sir.

81
00:03:53,476 --> 00:03:56,286
I want everything that can
fly up there immediately.

82
00:03:56,946 --> 00:03:57,806
Saul.

83
00:03:58,286 --> 00:03:59,217
Saul!

84
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,416
What the hell is wrong with you?

85
00:04:03,536 --> 00:04:04,776
Nothing, Bill.

86
00:04:05,847 --> 00:04:07,786
Never felt better in my life.

87
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:30,526
Colonel Tigh!

88
00:04:32,026 --> 00:04:33,986
I gave you an order.

89
00:04:34,116 --> 00:04:37,761
Everybody that's ever held a stick,
I want them up there now.

90
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,327
Get 'em out!

91
00:04:39,426 --> 00:04:40,957
- Put 'em up there!
- Sir.

92
00:04:42,036 --> 00:04:42,886
Attention.

93
00:04:42,986 --> 00:04:43,986
This is the XO.

94
00:04:44,096 --> 00:04:46,226
<i>All pilots, man your aircraft.</i>
- All right, let's go!

95
00:04:46,337 --> 00:04:48,221
<i>Get out there and kill those bastards.</i>
Get that bird over to 2

96
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:49,056
Where the frak are these nuggets?

97
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:51,486
Come on, mama's not gonna
save you today! Let's go!

98
00:04:51,886 --> 00:04:53,386
You want to fly or not?

99
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:56,846
Come on, ready or not, let's go.

100
00:04:57,306 --> 00:04:58,606
Hey, hey, this is crazy.

101
00:04:58,717 --> 00:05:00,004
What if I get up there
and another switch...

102
00:05:00,103 --> 00:05:01,421
flips in my head and
turns me against my own?

103
00:05:01,521 --> 00:05:02,421
What the frak is wrong with you?
Shut the frak up.

104
00:05:02,521 --> 00:05:03,816
It's like the colonel said, okay?

105
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:05,266
Just think of that.

106
00:05:05,366 --> 00:05:07,371
Be the man you want to
be till the day you die.

107
00:05:07,471 --> 00:05:08,651
That's all easier said than done,

108
00:05:08,751 --> 00:05:10,202
because I don't know what
the frak I am right now.

109
00:05:10,301 --> 00:05:11,881
You're Samuel T. Anders.
That's all you gotta remember.

110
00:05:11,981 --> 00:05:13,832
Samuel T. Anders. Now get
the frak in your ship.

111
00:05:13,931 --> 00:05:15,146
- Who else would he be?
- Hey.

112
00:05:15,596 --> 00:05:16,516
Hey, rook.

113
00:05:16,906 --> 00:05:18,041
Stay cool out there, all right?

114
00:05:18,141 --> 00:05:18,651
Yeah.

115
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:20,286
You'll lock in and do what
you've been trained to do.

116
00:05:21,156 --> 00:05:23,592
Guess it's just like suiting up for
a championship game, right?

117
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:24,361
Yeah, that's right.

118
00:05:24,462 --> 00:05:25,266
Good hunting.

119
00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:31,801
Well, if she didn't notice anything,
maybe the other Cylons won't either.

120
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:33,286
Yeah, well, don't wait to find out.

121
00:05:33,386 --> 00:05:34,486
Shoot first.

122
00:05:34,946 --> 00:05:36,436
Get the frak in there.
Go kill something.

123
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,066
Let's go! Let's load these birds!

124
00:05:40,886 --> 00:05:43,766
- Anders, get the frak in your viper!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

125
00:05:50,346 --> 00:05:51,281
Where are you taking me?

126
00:05:51,381 --> 00:05:53,756
It's a place we found.
An unused compartment.

127
00:06:29,626 --> 00:06:30,996
Sir, we've lost Sphyxis!

128
00:06:31,096 --> 00:06:32,696
Oh, my gods, captain Tarney.

129
00:06:32,806 --> 00:06:34,717
600 souls on that ship.

130
00:06:36,707 --> 00:06:38,386
How did they find us?

131
00:06:39,176 --> 00:06:40,786
That's the question, isn't it?

132
00:06:49,436 --> 00:06:50,771
Base ships launching missiles.

133
00:06:50,871 --> 00:06:54,066
40--correction, 50 plus inbound.

134
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:56,021
Half targeted on us, half on the fleet.

135
00:06:56,121 --> 00:06:59,176
Have triple-a target only missiles
going towards the fleet.

136
00:06:59,276 --> 00:06:59,981
We can handle the hits.

137
00:07:00,082 --> 00:07:01,401
- They can't.
- Sir.

138
00:07:01,501 --> 00:07:05,246
All forces, priority intercept enemy
missiles targeting civilian vessels.

139
00:07:07,676 --> 00:07:08,756
Okay.

140
00:07:08,856 --> 00:07:10,556
I am Samuel T. Anders.

141
00:07:10,656 --> 00:07:11,971
I was born on Picon.

142
00:07:12,071 --> 00:07:13,421
I went to Noyce elementary school.

143
00:07:13,521 --> 00:07:15,481
Get your thumb off the
transmit button, Sam.

144
00:07:15,582 --> 00:07:17,126
- You're blocking the freq.
- Copy that.

145
00:07:19,656 --> 00:07:21,046
Oh, frak me.

146
00:07:36,676 --> 00:07:37,876
Longshot, hardball.

147
00:07:37,976 --> 00:07:40,526
Turkey, right four low
at three, committing.

148
00:07:43,066 --> 00:07:47,226
Longshot, I got the--
Tally, I got your back.

149
00:07:51,546 --> 00:07:53,087
Seelix, there's a raider on you!

150
00:07:58,976 --> 00:07:59,936
Shoot, Anders!

151
00:08:00,036 --> 00:08:00,967
I'm trying to.

152
00:08:01,406 --> 00:08:02,446
Gods, Come on!

153
00:08:50,756 --> 00:08:53,336
Sir, the Cylon strike force has
just turned back to their ships.

154
00:08:59,126 --> 00:09:00,706
Base ships are spinning up.

155
00:09:01,746 --> 00:09:03,166
They're pulling out.

156
00:09:03,446 --> 00:09:05,886
We're gonna do the same damn thing
before they change their mind.

157
00:09:06,186 --> 00:09:08,916
Helo, have our fighters
cover our withdrawal.

158
00:09:09,056 --> 00:09:09,746
Yes, sir.

159
00:09:09,856 --> 00:09:11,801
- All fighters assume
rear cover formation.

160
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,406
They had us.

161
00:09:12,756 --> 00:09:13,846
Game over.

162
00:09:14,296 --> 00:09:16,426
Why the hell did they let us go?

163
00:09:18,256 --> 00:09:20,097
Maybe something's changed.

164
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:22,776
Like what?

165
00:09:26,526 --> 00:09:29,236
I have no idea, madame president.

166
00:09:29,627 --> 00:09:30,906
No idea.

You'll be safe here, Gaius.

171
00:12:12,637 --> 00:12:13,827
Right.

172
00:12:22,526 --> 00:12:25,627
Chief, I'm gonna need you to develop
my gun camera footage asap.

173
00:12:28,327 --> 00:12:30,706
I've got a hell of a set
of vacation pictures.

174
00:12:33,646 --> 00:12:35,156
I'll take my post-flight checklist.

175
00:12:35,396 --> 00:12:37,406
I want to sign out so I
can get in the showers.

176
00:12:40,867 --> 00:12:42,367
I don't have one for you.

177
00:12:46,526 --> 00:12:47,726
What's up?

178
00:12:59,327 --> 00:13:00,347
Okay.

179
00:13:01,176 --> 00:13:03,486
Okay, me too. It's okay, it's okay.

180
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,456
Do you believe in miracles?

181
00:13:08,046 --> 00:13:09,046
No.

182
00:13:14,256 --> 00:13:16,926
I told everyone that you were
too frakkin' mean to kill.

183
00:13:17,976 --> 00:13:19,617
Okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.

184
00:13:21,206 --> 00:13:22,107
I'm okay.

185
00:13:23,377 --> 00:13:25,406
What the hell are you
doing in a jock smock?

186
00:13:25,526 --> 00:13:30,246
I just finished viper transition
a week ago, and I started ACM.

187
00:13:30,357 --> 00:13:34,097
- How the...?
- Starbuck!

188
00:13:37,646 --> 00:13:39,156
I did it, boss.

189
00:13:40,827 --> 00:13:42,446
I found Earth.

190
00:13:43,736 --> 00:13:45,176
Everybody move back.

191
00:13:46,276 --> 00:13:48,546
Move in. Step away!

192
00:13:49,097 --> 00:13:50,546
I need you in sickbay.

193
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,877
Cottle's gonna give you a
complete physical examination.

194
00:13:53,986 --> 00:13:55,401
Okay, what the hell's going on?

195
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:56,831
I'm off the ship for a few hours

196
00:13:56,931 --> 00:13:58,776
- and everybody's acting--
- A few hours?

197
00:13:59,236 --> 00:14:01,367
Kara, you were gone for over two months.

198
00:14:04,137 --> 00:14:05,466
That's impossible.

199
00:14:06,837 --> 00:14:09,666
My ship's clock reads
six hours and change.

200
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,617
Then your clock's wrong, Kara.

201
00:14:12,446 --> 00:14:14,171
Sam's telling you the truth.

202
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,597
We thought you were dead.

203
00:14:17,587 --> 00:14:18,587
What?

204
00:14:30,377 --> 00:14:34,127
Gaius, I just wanted you to know
that we'll be back soon.

205
00:14:34,226 --> 00:14:36,816
Whatever you do, please don't
go anywhere by yourself.

206
00:14:36,936 --> 00:14:37,786
It's not safe.

207
00:14:37,896 --> 00:14:39,796
Tracey's here for anything you need.

208
00:14:39,936 --> 00:14:41,426
We'll be back as soon as
we've looked in on Derrick.

209
00:14:41,536 --> 00:14:42,262
Okay?

210
00:14:42,361 --> 00:14:43,391
- Right...
- oh, Derrick.

211
00:14:43,492 --> 00:14:45,181
That's your little boy, isn't it?

212
00:14:45,281 --> 00:14:46,446
The one in sickbay.

213
00:14:46,546 --> 00:14:47,486
Right.

214
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:51,107
Yes, I--I'm praying for his recovery.

215
00:14:51,736 --> 00:14:52,811
- Really?
- Yeah.

216
00:14:52,911 --> 00:14:53,837
Oh, thank you.

217
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:54,656
It's a pleasure.

218
00:14:54,756 --> 00:14:55,641
Thank you.

219
00:14:55,742 --> 00:14:57,887
So what's the game plan, ladies?

220
00:14:57,996 --> 00:14:58,891
Game plan?

221
00:14:58,992 --> 00:15:01,696
Well, this place is brilliant really.

222
00:15:01,796 --> 00:15:03,166
You know, it's beautiful.

223
00:15:03,746 --> 00:15:05,176
Just when am I getting out of here?

224
00:15:05,276 --> 00:15:06,242
When I am getting off the ship?

225
00:15:06,341 --> 00:15:07,631
Well, security's too tight.

226
00:15:07,732 --> 00:15:08,782
- Besides...
- Besides what?

227
00:15:08,881 --> 00:15:10,036
You're just trying
to keep me here and--

228
00:15:10,137 --> 00:15:10,501
Gaius,

229
00:15:10,601 --> 00:15:12,557
None of the other ships will have you.

230
00:15:17,446 --> 00:15:18,526
We'll be back.

231
00:15:22,686 --> 00:15:25,016
Yesterday, you were facing execution.

232
00:15:25,736 --> 00:15:26,771
Today you're free.

233
00:15:26,871 --> 00:15:28,387
Why the long face?

234
00:15:29,186 --> 00:15:30,406
Oh, gee, I don't know.

235
00:15:31,206 --> 00:15:33,516
From president of the colonies to this.

236
00:15:35,746 --> 00:15:36,896
King of fools.

237
00:15:38,526 --> 00:15:42,012
Probably best to be hated by
everyone than loved by this lot.

238
00:15:42,111 --> 00:15:45,066
Doomed to live out the rest of
my life in this loony bin.

239
00:15:45,766 --> 00:15:50,786
I don't know, that might have something
to do with my rather savage mood swings.

240
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:53,656
Relax, Gaius.

241
00:15:53,756 --> 00:15:56,716
You think I've brought you this
far just to let it end here?

242
00:15:56,816 --> 00:15:58,597
I need some encouragement.

243
00:15:58,696 --> 00:16:00,351
A ray of hope about the future.

244
00:16:00,452 --> 00:16:03,556
- An inkling...
- You've got me.

245
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:06,396
I'm here for you.

246
00:16:08,566 --> 00:16:10,306
That is so beautiful.

247
00:16:15,436 --> 00:16:17,506
Hello. Sorry, what?

248
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:19,766
The way you were praying.

249
00:16:21,256 --> 00:16:24,496
Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, thank you, yeah.

250
00:16:24,597 --> 00:16:26,212
Not some hollow ritual.

251
00:16:26,311 --> 00:16:28,607
No, no.

252
00:16:28,986 --> 00:16:31,506
It's as if the gods are
right here beside you.

253
00:16:31,637 --> 00:16:32,426
Well, yeah.

254
00:16:32,526 --> 00:16:37,016
When I pray to the gods, I feel...

255
00:16:37,436 --> 00:16:38,556
empty.

256
00:16:39,637 --> 00:16:41,801
Do you? That's a shame, isn't it?

257
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:43,377
Her gods are false.

258
00:16:43,786 --> 00:16:44,827
Tell her.

259
00:16:45,276 --> 00:16:48,611
Well, if you feel empty when you pray
to Zeus or Poseidon or Aphrodite,

260
00:16:48,712 --> 00:16:49,847
it's because it is empty.

261
00:16:49,946 --> 00:16:51,296
It's a totally empty experience.

262
00:16:51,396 --> 00:16:55,097
They're...they're not real.

263
00:16:55,966 --> 00:16:58,726
They've been promulgated by...

264
00:17:01,946 --> 00:17:04,136
a ruling elite,

265
00:17:05,026 --> 00:17:09,347
to stop you from learning the truth.

266
00:17:10,566 --> 00:17:11,926
And what truth is that?

267
00:17:12,026 --> 00:17:13,712
Um, that's a very good question.

268
00:17:13,811 --> 00:17:17,161
- What is the--the
- There's only one god.

269
00:17:17,261 --> 00:17:19,146
There is only one god.

270
00:17:19,296 --> 00:17:21,386
In a nutshell, that's the truth.

271
00:17:24,467 --> 00:17:25,806
We're alone here, aren't we?

272
00:17:25,936 --> 00:17:27,246
The others aren't coming back soon.

273
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:28,746
And the door is locked.

274
00:17:29,296 --> 00:17:30,426
All right, good.

275
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,847
Can you feel god's presence?

276
00:17:40,536 --> 00:17:42,496
You know what? I think I do.

277
00:17:44,256 --> 00:17:46,607
- So do I.
- Do you? Do you too?

278
00:17:47,036 --> 00:17:48,857
We both--we both feel--

279
00:17:56,827 --> 00:17:58,477
So what's Cottle's verdict?

280
00:17:59,766 --> 00:18:01,276
Everything checks out.

281
00:18:02,196 --> 00:18:05,186
So I'm me, not a Cylon?

282
00:18:05,686 --> 00:18:07,736
That is why you had me tested, right?

283
00:18:08,266 --> 00:18:10,676
- Kara, nobody said you were Cylon.
- But you were thinking it.

284
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:14,276
We had to be sure, Kara.

285
00:18:16,227 --> 00:18:17,477
Fair enough.

286
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:19,406
Let's go through it again.

287
00:18:19,756 --> 00:18:21,597
How many times do you want to hear it?

288
00:18:21,696 --> 00:18:25,286
As many times as it takes to make sense.

289
00:18:25,736 --> 00:18:27,482
I followed a heavy
raider into the storm.

290
00:18:27,582 --> 00:18:28,571
Took some hits, passed out.

291
00:18:28,671 --> 00:18:31,041
When I came to, I was
orbiting this planet.

292
00:18:31,141 --> 00:18:34,727
It's yellow moon and star matches
the description in Pythia.

293
00:18:34,827 --> 00:18:36,886
I took these pictures in orbit.

294
00:18:36,986 --> 00:18:40,506
The star patterns match what we
saw in the tomb of Athena.

295
00:18:42,126 --> 00:18:43,286
How did you get here?

296
00:18:43,386 --> 00:18:45,587
I told you I don't know exactly.

297
00:18:45,686 --> 00:18:48,097
Well, that's just not
good enough, captain.

298
00:18:48,396 --> 00:18:51,467
Tell us everything you remember.

299
00:18:54,707 --> 00:18:56,516
I remember taking the photos.

300
00:18:57,496 --> 00:18:59,626
Turning my ship in a reciprocal heading.

301
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,457
And then I'm not sure.

302
00:19:09,906 --> 00:19:11,516
I must've blacked out again.

303
00:19:14,506 --> 00:19:19,717
I remember a giant
gas planet with rings.

304
00:19:20,056 --> 00:19:23,936
I remember a flashing triple star

305
00:19:24,766 --> 00:19:25,926
and a comet.

306
00:19:26,376 --> 00:19:27,926
And then I was back with the fleet.

307
00:19:29,866 --> 00:19:32,727
And for you, all of this took six hours.

308
00:19:32,837 --> 00:19:35,467
I do not understand the time
discrepancy either, okay?

309
00:19:35,566 --> 00:19:36,866
All I know is I was there.

310
00:19:36,996 --> 00:19:37,957
I took the pictures.

311
00:19:38,056 --> 00:19:39,977
I didn't imagine it!

312
00:19:44,327 --> 00:19:45,926
I had my crew clean it up.

313
00:19:46,316 --> 00:19:48,357
There's not a ding or a scratch on it.

314
00:19:48,736 --> 00:19:51,156
It's the got same tail number
as the one she flew out on.

315
00:19:51,587 --> 00:19:53,616
But I've been fixing up that
old bird since day one,

316
00:19:53,717 --> 00:19:56,467
And this thing looks like it's been
rolled off the showroom floor.

317
00:19:57,376 --> 00:19:59,796
So it's not the same ship.

318
00:20:01,396 --> 00:20:04,636
Unless she found a hell of a body shop
out there, no, ma'am, it's not.

319
00:20:07,717 --> 00:20:10,602
Admiral, it's just not
the outside either.

320
00:20:10,702 --> 00:20:13,556
This is the data from the nav computer.

321
00:20:14,186 --> 00:20:15,276
There isn't any.

322
00:20:15,376 --> 00:20:16,136
It's blank.

323
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:18,626
There's no record of
where this ship has been.

324
00:20:19,906 --> 00:20:21,116
Okay.

325
00:20:21,926 --> 00:20:23,352
Put her in the brig.

326
00:20:23,452 --> 00:20:24,361
What?

327
00:20:24,462 --> 00:20:27,727
So some things don't add up, and we're
back to thinking she's a Cylon?

328
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:31,446
- What about Cottle's test?
- Cottle's test doesn't prove anything.

329
00:20:31,886 --> 00:20:34,941
Even if her dna's the same,
she could still be a Cylon.

330
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:37,251
She could've been one
from the beginning.

331
00:20:37,352 --> 00:20:40,097
Baltar's Cylon detector was a crock.

332
00:20:40,196 --> 00:20:41,546
It failed to I.D. Boomer.

333
00:20:44,556 --> 00:20:47,482
I know how you feel about her, Bill,

334
00:20:47,582 --> 00:20:50,776
But that is exactly what the Cylons
could be counting on here.

335
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:52,566
Then we're back where we started from.

336
00:20:53,426 --> 00:20:54,472
There could be Cylons right here,

337
00:20:54,571 --> 00:20:56,957
and we wouldn't know it till they
put a bullet in our heads.

338
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:58,587
Or lead us into an ambush.

339
00:20:59,786 --> 00:21:02,441
They Cylon fleet had enough firepower
to blow us out of the sky,

340
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,597
but instead they ran and jumped.

341
00:21:06,276 --> 00:21:10,236
And there's Kara Thrace suddenly back
from the dead, having found Earth.

342
00:21:10,347 --> 00:21:12,401
If Kara Thrace can lead
us off our course--

343
00:21:12,501 --> 00:21:14,056
Course? What course?

344
00:21:14,156 --> 00:21:17,516
The nebula was supposed to be another
clue on the way to Earth, but it--

345
00:21:17,616 --> 00:21:21,766
The nebula is only a road sign
along the way to Earth.

346
00:21:21,866 --> 00:21:24,816
And we need to continue
to follow its path.

347
00:21:25,266 --> 00:21:30,636
Well, what if Kara is the clue that
we were supposed to find?

348
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:33,077
And what if she's playing you?

349
00:21:33,217 --> 00:21:34,556
And what if she's playing you?

350
00:21:35,006 --> 00:21:36,306
And all of us?

351
00:21:44,246 --> 00:21:48,296
Gaius, please, can you help me?

352
00:21:50,066 --> 00:21:51,561
- Uh, what's going on?
- Okay.

353
00:21:51,661 --> 00:21:53,006
- Oh, god, um...
- Watch his head.

354
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:54,727
It's Derrick.

355
00:21:54,827 --> 00:21:55,837
Derrick, is it?

356
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:02,577
Uh, Derrick, I see.

357
00:22:02,676 --> 00:22:03,796
Where are my clothes?

358
00:22:03,896 --> 00:22:04,847
- It's okay.
- Is it?

359
00:22:11,186 --> 00:22:12,486
Well, did they give you a diagnosis?

360
00:22:12,587 --> 00:22:15,499
- They said he's got,
um, viral encephalitis.

361
00:22:15,598 --> 00:22:15,996
Viral?

362
00:22:16,946 --> 00:22:19,671
I don't know, it's some
inflammation of the brain.

363
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:21,026
Can't the doctors do something?

364
00:22:21,126 --> 00:22:22,571
Well, not if it's viral, no.

365
00:22:22,671 --> 00:22:26,236
I'm afraid it's up to
Derrick's immune system.

366
00:22:27,036 --> 00:22:28,977
Uh, and he has to be strong.

367
00:22:29,077 --> 00:22:30,866
And we have to be strong for him.

368
00:22:31,967 --> 00:22:34,316
I didn't want him to die
in that sickbay, so...

369
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,516
So I brought him here.

370
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:39,876
So he can be with us.

371
00:22:40,386 --> 00:22:41,406
All of us.

372
00:22:42,107 --> 00:22:43,791
Yeah, all of us.

373
00:22:43,891 --> 00:22:45,207
Give me your hand, please.

374
00:22:48,946 --> 00:22:50,477
I wish there was--

375
00:22:52,256 --> 00:22:54,036
You know I prayed for him, don't you?

376
00:22:54,696 --> 00:22:56,026
- I know.
- I prayed for him.

377
00:22:56,756 --> 00:22:57,756
I know.

378
00:22:58,107 --> 00:22:59,097
I guess.

379
00:23:00,077 --> 00:23:04,016
I guess that the one true god just
doesn't want him to live, right?

380
00:23:30,886 --> 00:23:34,306
Anybody still hearing
that frakkin' song?

381
00:23:34,936 --> 00:23:35,727
Nope.

382
00:23:38,546 --> 00:23:43,126
Maybe it stopped when we figured
out who...what we are.

383
00:23:44,406 --> 00:23:46,446
Could it have been some kind of trigger?

384
00:23:48,077 --> 00:23:50,467
To switch us on?

385
00:23:50,577 --> 00:23:54,061
You know, after that raider scanned
me with that red light,

386
00:23:54,161 --> 00:23:55,597
damn thing just cut and ran.

387
00:23:55,946 --> 00:23:57,107
They all did.

388
00:23:58,207 --> 00:24:00,026
You think it recognized you as a Cylon?

389
00:24:00,406 --> 00:24:01,156
I don't know.

390
00:24:03,116 --> 00:24:04,597
Maybe that's why it didn't shoot me.

391
00:24:04,707 --> 00:24:07,616
More important, why didn't I shoot him?

392
00:24:07,806 --> 00:24:09,082
Racetrack was right.

393
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:12,186
- You just made a dumb nugget mistake.
- Did I?

394
00:24:12,977 --> 00:24:15,686
Maybe I was programmed to
leave my gun safeties on.

395
00:24:16,347 --> 00:24:19,286
Those bastards can't
program me to help them.

396
00:24:20,227 --> 00:24:21,357
No way.

397
00:24:22,126 --> 00:24:24,376
Boomer thought the same thing.

398
00:24:26,406 --> 00:24:28,077
And then she shot the old man.

399
00:24:28,196 --> 00:24:30,256
Boomer didn't know what she was.

400
00:24:30,646 --> 00:24:31,756
We do.

401
00:24:32,566 --> 00:24:34,477
That is not gonna happen.

402
00:24:46,587 --> 00:24:47,607
Agreed?

403
00:25:03,337 --> 00:25:05,087
I don't know why I'm here.

404
00:25:11,926 --> 00:25:13,066
Yes, I do.

405
00:25:16,727 --> 00:25:19,791
I'm here because of the
things that we've shared

406
00:25:19,891 --> 00:25:22,781
- and the things that we've seen.
- The visions in the opera house.

407
00:25:22,881 --> 00:25:25,212
You went inside. You
saw more than I did.

408
00:25:25,311 --> 00:25:27,641
I thought that maybe you could help me.

409
00:25:27,741 --> 00:25:29,332
Help you how?

410
00:25:29,431 --> 00:25:32,026
I need to know about the other five.

411
00:25:32,136 --> 00:25:34,166
The types we've never seen.

412
00:25:35,926 --> 00:25:40,316
The ones that Baltar
calls the final five.

413
00:25:40,416 --> 00:25:43,736
And you want to know if
Kara Thrace is one of them.

414
00:25:44,166 --> 00:25:45,587
Yes.

415
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:50,816
I've been programmed
never to think about them.

416
00:25:51,227 --> 00:25:53,056
Well, your programming isn't working,

417
00:25:53,156 --> 00:25:55,097
because you're thinking
about them right now.

418
00:25:56,506 --> 00:25:57,816
I try not to.

419
00:25:57,916 --> 00:26:01,386
Trying not to is thinking about them.
How do you rationalize that?

420
00:26:06,957 --> 00:26:08,126
All right, no.

421
00:26:08,686 --> 00:26:09,482
Back off.

422
00:26:09,582 --> 00:26:10,866
Don't leave, back off.

423
00:26:13,926 --> 00:26:15,696
The five are close.

424
00:26:17,416 --> 00:26:18,666
What?

425
00:26:18,766 --> 00:26:20,506
I can feel them.

426
00:26:24,526 --> 00:26:25,636
What about this one?

427
00:26:26,607 --> 00:26:28,347
It's a protoplanetary system.

428
00:26:28,906 --> 00:26:30,016
So?

429
00:26:30,687 --> 00:26:32,181
Nothing but rocks.

430
00:26:32,281 --> 00:26:35,207
No ringed gas giants like
you claimed you saw.

431
00:26:35,306 --> 00:26:36,996
I did see it, lieutenant.

432
00:26:37,397 --> 00:26:38,256
If you say so, sir.

433
00:26:38,357 --> 00:26:39,891
And what are you saying, Mr. Gaeta?

434
00:26:39,991 --> 00:26:41,202
I'm not saying anything, sir.

435
00:26:41,301 --> 00:26:43,236
I'm just following orders.

436
00:26:43,337 --> 00:26:44,667
Well, I'm ordering you to help me.

437
00:26:44,766 --> 00:26:48,156
- You're ordering me?
- Mr. Gaeta, take a break.

438
00:26:48,647 --> 00:26:50,097
With pleasure, sir.

439
00:26:50,296 --> 00:26:51,937
Jump clock is running, Dee.

440
00:26:52,036 --> 00:26:52,986
Take us out of here.

441
00:26:53,087 --> 00:26:53,877
Yes, sir.

442
00:26:54,786 --> 00:26:55,897
What's going on?

443
00:26:57,577 --> 00:26:59,327
I see it on his face.

444
00:27:00,647 --> 00:27:01,722
On all of their faces.

445
00:27:01,821 --> 00:27:02,847
No one believes me.

446
00:27:08,286 --> 00:27:09,636
You want people to believe you?

447
00:27:11,136 --> 00:27:12,486
Find that star system.

448
00:27:13,127 --> 00:27:14,437
It's a big waste of time.

449
00:27:14,536 --> 00:27:17,266
Hey, we've only been at it a few hours.

450
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:19,241
Found maybe a dozen trinaries.

451
00:27:19,341 --> 00:27:20,861
Baltar's calculations took months.

452
00:27:20,962 --> 00:27:22,707
It doesn't work like that.

453
00:27:22,816 --> 00:27:24,486
How does it work, Kara?

454
00:27:27,716 --> 00:27:29,776
It's a feeling.

455
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,796
An intuition.

456
00:27:31,897 --> 00:27:35,321
I didn't use nav fixes
to get there and back.

457
00:27:35,421 --> 00:27:38,227
When we were at that nebula,
it was so clear to me.

458
00:27:38,337 --> 00:27:41,727
But every jump we take farther
away, the clarity fades.

459
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:45,727
If we keep jumping like this,
I won't be able to find our way back.

460
00:27:46,636 --> 00:27:47,756
That'll be all.

461
00:27:49,006 --> 00:27:51,941
All hands, prepare for jump in ten.

462
00:27:52,042 --> 00:27:53,587
The president's adamant.

463
00:27:53,926 --> 00:27:57,281
We're gonna continue on the course
laid out by the eye of jupiter.

464
00:27:57,381 --> 00:28:02,727
Five, four, three, two, jump.

465
00:28:08,446 --> 00:28:09,996
We're going the wrong way.

466
00:28:12,036 --> 00:28:14,212
If we keep jumping like this,
I'm gonna lose the feeling completely,

467
00:28:14,312 --> 00:28:15,847
never be able to take us back.

468
00:28:17,457 --> 00:28:19,296
What do you want me to do?

469
00:28:21,256 --> 00:28:23,589
You want me to go to
Laura Roslin, tell her...

470
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:25,556
forget Pythia and the Eye of Jupiter,

471
00:28:25,656 --> 00:28:28,926
because Kara has some feeling
about where Earth is?

472
00:28:29,026 --> 00:28:30,236
Yes.

473
00:28:33,016 --> 00:28:34,466
I can't.

474
00:28:35,616 --> 00:28:37,877
I just left your ship.

475
00:28:38,426 --> 00:28:40,667
There's not a scratch on it.

476
00:28:41,167 --> 00:28:42,977
It's brand-new.

477
00:28:46,446 --> 00:28:48,667
How do you explain that, Kara?

478
00:28:54,207 --> 00:28:55,306
Look at me.

479
00:28:56,306 --> 00:28:57,996
Look at me!

480
00:29:00,577 --> 00:29:02,687
I swear to gods.

481
00:29:03,446 --> 00:29:06,147
It's me, Kara.

482
00:29:06,727 --> 00:29:08,566
I can do this.

483
00:29:11,837 --> 00:29:13,611
You once said you loved
me like a daughter.

484
00:29:13,712 --> 00:29:15,616
If you still do, you've
gotta trust me on this one.

485
00:29:21,097 --> 00:29:22,806
I can't afford to.

486
00:29:35,526 --> 00:29:36,996
They're waiting for me.

487
00:29:37,837 --> 00:29:39,661
No! No!

488
00:29:39,761 --> 00:29:41,207
They're waiting for me.

489
00:29:42,526 --> 00:29:44,556
No! No!

490
00:29:45,337 --> 00:29:46,996
What should I believe?

491
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,466
Should I believe my heart?

492
00:29:49,147 --> 00:29:50,917
Or my eyes?

493
00:29:51,127 --> 00:29:52,627
They're waiting for me.

494
00:29:55,087 --> 00:29:56,796
Well, you know where I stand.

495
00:30:00,636 --> 00:30:02,227
I want to believe her.

496
00:30:03,236 --> 00:30:05,056
But the president's right.

497
00:30:05,496 --> 00:30:08,127
It's exactly what the Cylons
would be counting on.

498
00:30:08,227 --> 00:30:09,901
So I guess you're not changing course.

499
00:30:10,002 --> 00:30:12,496
For the time being,
we follow the president's lead.

500
00:30:14,906 --> 00:30:17,087
She still staying in your quarters?

501
00:30:17,796 --> 00:30:20,587
Just till we find a place to put her up...

502
00:30:20,687 --> 00:30:23,477
to finish threst of
her doloxan treatment.

503
00:30:28,647 --> 00:30:32,016
I want to thank you for suiting
up during the fight.

504
00:30:34,377 --> 00:30:36,066
We needed everyone up there.

505
00:30:44,877 --> 00:30:46,296
We still do.

506
00:30:52,087 --> 00:30:54,327
I took those off for the wrong reasons.

507
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:56,486
Put them back on.

508
00:30:57,696 --> 00:31:00,696
Baltar's trial may have
been the trigger, but, um...

509
00:31:03,776 --> 00:31:06,687
This is a feeling I've
been having for a while.

510
00:31:11,256 --> 00:31:12,796
It's time for a change.

511
00:31:14,097 --> 00:31:15,426
I need to move on.

512
00:31:18,386 --> 00:31:21,016
I've had some feelers
from the government.

513
00:31:21,187 --> 00:31:23,647
There's a position opening up.

514
00:31:26,366 --> 00:31:29,577
And I think I can make a
valuable contribution there.

515
00:31:30,996 --> 00:31:32,977
Maybe even more than in the cockpit.

516
00:31:43,926 --> 00:31:47,306
Dad, what if Zach had come
back to us in that viper?

517
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:52,127
If my brother had climbed
out of that cockpit.

518
00:31:54,357 --> 00:31:56,526
Would it matter if he were a Cylon?

519
00:31:58,736 --> 00:32:00,347
If he always had been?

520
00:32:02,966 --> 00:32:04,377
When all's said and done,

521
00:32:06,477 --> 00:32:09,627
would that change how we
really feel about him?

522
00:33:04,406 --> 00:33:05,616
Please, god.

523
00:33:08,877 --> 00:33:11,667
I'm only asking you this one last time.

524
00:33:14,246 --> 00:33:16,236
Don't let this child die.

525
00:33:20,496 --> 00:33:23,446
Has he sinned against you?
He can't have sinned against you.

526
00:33:25,466 --> 00:33:27,516
He's not even had a life yet.

527
00:33:28,857 --> 00:33:31,806
How can you take him and let me live?

528
00:33:33,196 --> 00:33:34,917
After all I've done?

529
00:33:36,077 --> 00:33:40,597
Really, if you want
someone to suffer, take me.

530
00:33:42,457 --> 00:33:45,006
We both know I deserve it.

531
00:33:47,897 --> 00:33:51,246
I have been selfish and weak.

532
00:33:51,347 --> 00:33:53,857
I have failed so many people.

533
00:33:55,386 --> 00:33:57,147
And I have killed.

534
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:02,256
I'm not asking for your forgiveness.

535
00:34:04,986 --> 00:34:10,506
I'm just asking that you spare
the life of this innocent child.

536
00:34:13,026 --> 00:34:14,417
Don't take him.

537
00:34:15,206 --> 00:34:16,837
Take me.

538
00:34:16,946 --> 00:34:19,577
Take me, take me please.

539
00:34:34,476 --> 00:34:37,976
We were all very moved by the
way you prayed for Derrick.

540
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:39,077
Fat lot of good it did him.

541
00:34:39,206 --> 00:34:41,367
Unfortunately, he's worse,
if you hadn't realized.

542
00:34:42,466 --> 00:34:44,226
Doesn't mean god didn't hear you.

543
00:34:44,966 --> 00:34:47,426
I'm sure he's looking after
Derrick's immortal soul.

544
00:34:47,526 --> 00:34:49,301
Yes, I wish I shared your
confidence on that one.

545
00:34:49,401 --> 00:34:50,357
I really do.

546
00:34:51,607 --> 00:34:54,246
But you have to keep the faith.

547
00:34:54,617 --> 00:34:57,446
- We all look to you for guidance
- well, you shouldn't, should you?

548
00:34:58,117 --> 00:34:59,907
I mean, you're just--

549
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:04,627
Well, you're very young and--

550
00:35:09,617 --> 00:35:11,486
What are we doing here exactly?

551
00:35:30,286 --> 00:35:31,387
Thank you.

552
00:35:38,976 --> 00:35:40,306
Mr. President.

553
00:35:42,456 --> 00:35:43,786
Gaius, let's go.

554
00:35:47,917 --> 00:35:49,966
- We should get back, okay?
- Good to see you again.

555
00:35:53,857 --> 00:35:54,542
I'm sorry.

556
00:35:54,641 --> 00:35:55,752
I can't--

557
00:35:55,851 --> 00:35:58,716
We met at the groundbreaking
ceremony on New Caprica.

558
00:35:59,647 --> 00:36:01,377
Introduced you to my son Kevin.

559
00:36:01,657 --> 00:36:03,936
He told you he wanted to be
president when he grew up.

560
00:36:04,087 --> 00:36:07,716
You told him that he could be
if he stuck to his schoolwork.

561
00:36:09,137 --> 00:36:11,286
He's a redhead little boy, isn't he?

562
00:36:12,077 --> 00:36:14,331
- About eight or nine years old.
- Seven.

563
00:36:14,431 --> 00:36:15,996
- Seven years old.
- Seven years old.

564
00:36:19,716 --> 00:36:21,337
How is, um...

565
00:36:21,706 --> 00:36:22,561
- Kevin.
- Kevin?

566
00:36:22,661 --> 00:36:23,597
- How is he?
- He's dead.

567
00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:26,532
Your police shot him.

568
00:36:26,631 --> 00:36:28,456
Come on, Gaius, let's get out of here.

569
00:36:35,077 --> 00:36:35,877
Leave her alone!

570
00:36:35,976 --> 00:36:37,252
- Look at me!
- Leave her alone!

571
00:36:37,351 --> 00:36:38,327
Look at me!

572
00:36:45,966 --> 00:36:46,926
Go on, scream.

573
00:36:47,926 --> 00:36:49,186
Come on, scream!

574
00:36:49,286 --> 00:36:51,131
I want to see if anyone
comes to help you.

575
00:36:51,232 --> 00:36:52,631
Aah!

576
00:36:52,732 --> 00:36:53,976
Scream!

577
00:36:58,347 --> 00:36:59,426
Beg.

578
00:36:59,577 --> 00:37:02,236
I bet you begged the Cylons.
Why don't you beg for me?

579
00:37:02,806 --> 00:37:04,006
Come on, beg!

580
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,036
Get up! Get on your knees!

581
00:37:07,536 --> 00:37:08,647
Get up!

582
00:37:12,417 --> 00:37:15,466
You asked god to take your
life instead of the boy's.

583
00:37:15,617 --> 00:37:18,077
- Did you mean it?
- Yes.

584
00:37:19,077 --> 00:37:20,107
Do it.

585
00:37:21,137 --> 00:37:22,617
Take my life.

586
00:37:23,627 --> 00:37:24,816
Please.

587
00:37:29,466 --> 00:37:30,526
Please.

588
00:37:33,657 --> 00:37:35,236
Please take my life.

589
00:37:45,587 --> 00:37:46,617
No.

590
00:37:53,127 --> 00:37:54,036
You see?

591
00:37:54,137 --> 00:37:56,176
Gaius, I knew god wouldn't desert you.

592
00:37:56,306 --> 00:37:58,341
I mean, I felt his love
course through me,

593
00:37:58,441 --> 00:38:00,377
Giving me the strength to smite them.

594
00:38:00,506 --> 00:38:01,877
A little less smiting next time,

595
00:38:01,976 --> 00:38:03,996
Unless you want to be held
up on murder charges.

596
00:38:07,897 --> 00:38:08,861
Gaius!

597
00:38:08,962 --> 00:38:10,676
- You two, watch the door.
- Gaius...

598
00:38:12,196 --> 00:38:13,506
Are you all right?

599
00:38:14,897 --> 00:38:16,676
I cut myself shaving.

600
00:38:17,117 --> 00:38:18,066
Okay.

601
00:38:18,426 --> 00:38:20,667
Well, you have to come.
You have to come and see Derrick.

602
00:38:21,036 --> 00:38:21,796
Derrick?

603
00:38:22,186 --> 00:38:23,242
Derrick, oh, yes.

604
00:38:23,341 --> 00:38:24,121
God answered your prayers.

605
00:38:24,222 --> 00:38:25,391
- You have to see.
- What?

606
00:38:25,492 --> 00:38:26,347
Look.

607
00:38:28,907 --> 00:38:30,127
Look at him.

608
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:34,006
Hi.

609
00:38:41,926 --> 00:38:43,526
And no trace of a fever.

610
00:38:48,157 --> 00:38:49,536
It's a miracle.

611
00:39:21,196 --> 00:39:22,597
No one took it down.

612
00:39:24,426 --> 00:39:25,512
Not the old man.

613
00:39:25,611 --> 00:39:26,706
Not Lee.

614
00:39:27,377 --> 00:39:29,617
Not even you, Sam.

615
00:39:29,716 --> 00:39:31,706
You just got back, Kara.

616
00:39:32,256 --> 00:39:33,926
We're all still trying
to get a handle on this.

617
00:39:34,026 --> 00:39:36,176
You know, you gotta
cut people some slack.

618
00:39:37,276 --> 00:39:39,186
Cut yourself some too.

619
00:39:42,167 --> 00:39:44,946
When I woke up orbiting Earth,

620
00:39:45,066 --> 00:39:47,597
I just figured it was
some crazy dream, but...

621
00:39:50,426 --> 00:39:54,716
I went in following a heavy raider.

622
00:39:57,667 --> 00:40:00,087
I mean, maybe the Cylons
pulled me out of the soup.

623
00:40:00,536 --> 00:40:02,627
Captured me, brainwashed me.

624
00:40:03,407 --> 00:40:06,036
On Caprica, and the experiment on me.

625
00:40:06,147 --> 00:40:08,091
I mean, did they take pieces of me?

626
00:40:08,191 --> 00:40:11,292
I mean, is it possible
that they grew me,

627
00:40:11,391 --> 00:40:12,911
another me in a petri dish,

628
00:40:13,012 --> 00:40:15,671
and they embedded me with the memories,

629
00:40:15,772 --> 00:40:16,966
or it with the memories,

630
00:40:18,897 --> 00:40:19,447
Or-- I don't know.

631
00:40:20,926 --> 00:40:23,286
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, hey, no.

632
00:40:23,387 --> 00:40:26,137
Kara, no. Listen to me.

633
00:40:26,907 --> 00:40:31,736
If you were a Cylon, then you've
been one from the beginning.

634
00:40:32,716 --> 00:40:34,046
Like Boomer.

635
00:40:34,857 --> 00:40:37,167
Spend my entire life
thinking I'm one thing--

636
00:40:37,266 --> 00:40:38,881
Yeah, and then you wake up one day

637
00:40:38,982 --> 00:40:40,816
and discover you're another.

638
00:40:41,566 --> 00:40:44,206
Still doesn't change who you really are.

639
00:40:44,877 --> 00:40:50,566
Still doesn't change the fact that
I love you no matter what.

640
00:40:52,176 --> 00:40:54,242
You are a better person than I am, Sam,

641
00:40:54,341 --> 00:40:57,006
because if I found out
that you were a Cylon,

642
00:40:58,107 --> 00:41:00,377
I would put a bullet between your eyes.

643
00:41:01,066 --> 00:41:07,536
All hands, prepare for jump
in four, three, two, jump.

644
00:41:10,256 --> 00:41:12,726
Damn it, they're still going
in the wrong direction.

645
00:41:14,867 --> 00:41:17,022
Oh, one more jump and I'm gonna
lose my way altogether.

646
00:41:17,121 --> 00:41:18,286
All right, we gotta find you a rack.

647
00:41:18,387 --> 00:41:19,617
Okay, take it easy.

648
00:41:21,316 --> 00:41:22,587
It's Roslin.

649
00:41:23,607 --> 00:41:25,806
The old man's not gonna listen
to me as along as she's--

650
00:41:27,446 --> 00:41:28,252
I gotta get to her.

651
00:41:28,351 --> 00:41:29,441
No, you can't do that.

652
00:41:29,542 --> 00:41:30,706
- Is that a fact?
- Yeah.

653
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,637
No, no, wait!

654
00:41:39,486 --> 00:41:41,176
What the hell are you doing, Kara?

655
00:41:41,647 --> 00:41:43,127
Where's the president, Sam?

656
00:41:44,506 --> 00:41:45,676
Kara, come on.
