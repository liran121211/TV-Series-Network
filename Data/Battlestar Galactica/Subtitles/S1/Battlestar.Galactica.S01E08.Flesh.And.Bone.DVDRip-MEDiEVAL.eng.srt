1
00:00:02,167 --> 00:00:04,806
<i>Previously on
Battlestar Galactica:</i>

2
00:00:34,647 --> 00:00:35,796
Doral!

3
00:00:41,087 --> 00:00:44,443
When this body dies, my consciousness
will be transferred to another one.

4
00:00:44,527 --> 00:00:48,520
The Cylons have the ability to mimic
human form. They look like us now.

5
00:00:48,607 --> 00:00:51,599
<i>This man has been identified
as a Cylon agent.</i>

6
00:00:51,967 --> 00:00:55,562
- You sleep, I watch.
- No. You're the one who needs sleep.

7
00:00:57,007 --> 00:00:59,805
You were lucky
that you didn't lapse into a coma.

8
00:00:59,887 --> 00:01:03,800
The time is going to come when you won't
be able to hide what you're going through.

9
00:02:32,047 --> 00:02:33,196
Laura.

10
00:02:51,487 --> 00:02:52,556
Yes?

11
00:02:53,247 --> 00:02:56,000
Madam President, are you okay in there?

12
00:02:57,327 --> 00:03:01,957
I'm fine, it's just the side effects
from the Chamalla.

13
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:06,766
You know that thing they say,
"What's worse? The cancer or the cure?"

14
00:03:06,847 --> 00:03:07,836
What do you need?

15
00:03:07,927 --> 00:03:11,761
<i>You have an urgent call
from the Captain of the Gemenon Traveller.</i>

16
00:03:11,847 --> 00:03:15,476
Can I call him back?
He says he found a Cylon on board.

17
00:03:20,607 --> 00:03:23,121
They found him
in the starboard storage compartment.

18
00:03:23,207 --> 00:03:25,198
Looked like he'd been camped here
for days.

19
00:03:25,287 --> 00:03:27,357
<i>Are they sure it's a Cylon?</i>

20
00:03:27,727 --> 00:03:30,924
The captain identified him
by one of the photos we sent out.

21
00:03:31,007 --> 00:03:34,477
He's another copy
of the man you knew as Leoben Conroy.

22
00:03:35,287 --> 00:03:36,879
Where is it now?

23
00:03:37,367 --> 00:03:41,440
<i>Aboard the Gemenon Traveller,
locked in a storeroom, under guard.</i>

24
00:03:42,567 --> 00:03:44,239
Isolate that ship.

25
00:03:44,527 --> 00:03:47,166
<i>Order the CAP to fly escort
around the Gemenon Traveller.</i>

26
00:03:47,247 --> 00:03:49,807
And not to approach
any other ship in the fleet.

27
00:03:49,887 --> 00:03:50,922
Aye, sir.

28
00:03:51,007 --> 00:03:52,645
<i>Kat, Galactica, fly close...</i>

29
00:03:52,727 --> 00:03:55,844
I'll send a team over
to destroy it immediately.

30
00:03:56,567 --> 00:03:59,798
<i>I want this man interrogated first.
First of all...</i>

31
00:03:59,887 --> 00:04:01,525
<i>it's not a him, it's an it...</i>

32
00:04:01,607 --> 00:04:04,485
second, anything it says cannot be trusted.

33
00:04:04,687 --> 00:04:06,962
<i>Best thing to do is destroy it immediately.</i>

34
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:10,198
I'd like to hear what this thing has to say.
It might be important.

35
00:04:10,287 --> 00:04:13,757
Madam President,
I've dealt with this model before.

36
00:04:14,327 --> 00:04:18,923
It'll fill your head with doubletalk,
half-baked philosophy and confuse you.

37
00:04:19,247 --> 00:04:21,397
Then send someone
who won't be easily confused.

38
00:04:21,487 --> 00:04:23,000
That's an order, Commander.

39
00:04:23,087 --> 00:04:24,600
I want him interrogated.

40
00:04:25,287 --> 00:04:26,925
Order understood.

41
00:04:29,247 --> 00:04:32,922
Think it'll give me something?
No.

42
00:04:36,087 --> 00:04:37,839
President disagrees.

43
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:42,959
You need me to go, I'll shower up and go.

44
00:04:44,767 --> 00:04:46,325
How's this coming?

45
00:04:46,407 --> 00:04:49,638
We got the entire avionics package
figured out.

46
00:04:49,727 --> 00:04:51,843
Fire control, navigation...

47
00:04:51,967 --> 00:04:55,164
and I think that I am zeroing in
on her FTL drive.

48
00:04:59,447 --> 00:05:02,405
I did this in a hurry about three weeks ago.

49
00:05:03,127 --> 00:05:05,766
It's my after-action report on Leoben.

50
00:05:06,447 --> 00:05:09,644
It's a very clever machine.
Manipulative, cunning.

51
00:05:10,367 --> 00:05:13,325
The only problem with Leoben
isn't that he lies.

52
00:05:13,407 --> 00:05:15,318
That would be too easy.

53
00:05:15,727 --> 00:05:18,195
It's that he mixes lies with truth.

54
00:05:18,487 --> 00:05:21,797
Just remember,
he's gonna try to get into your head.

55
00:05:22,247 --> 00:05:25,603
My mum always said
there was nothing in there anyway.

56
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:28,719
Just be careful.

57
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:33,200
<i>He has an agenda.
It's a goal you won't understand until later.</i>

58
00:05:33,527 --> 00:05:36,599
Your job is to make sure
he doesn't achieve the goal.

59
00:05:36,687 --> 00:05:37,961
Yes, sir.

60
00:07:09,647 --> 00:07:11,000
Lieutenant.

61
00:07:15,207 --> 00:07:16,959
- What's up?
- Nothing.

62
00:07:18,407 --> 00:07:21,717
Just wanted to see if
what I told you the other day helped at all?

63
00:07:21,807 --> 00:07:24,082
Yeah. Actually it did.

64
00:07:24,887 --> 00:07:27,799
<i>You do treat this thing
more like an animal than a machine...</i>

65
00:07:27,887 --> 00:07:30,799
and it actually works.

66
00:07:32,807 --> 00:07:36,766
Where did you come up with that
anyway? Just pop into your head?

67
00:07:39,767 --> 00:07:43,680
- I'm a Cylon.
- You know, that's not even funny.

68
00:07:45,127 --> 00:07:47,402
If I could prove that I wasn't...

69
00:07:48,247 --> 00:07:51,523
would that make a difference?
You know, between us?

70
00:07:58,327 --> 00:08:00,636
<i>Gemenon Traveller,
Raptor seven-one-niner...</i>

71
00:08:00,727 --> 00:08:02,160
<i>inbound with Lt. Thrace aboard.</i>

72
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:03,805
<i>Permission to dock.</i>

73
00:08:03,887 --> 00:08:06,765
<i>Roger, seven-one-niner.
Permission granted.</i>

74
00:08:09,247 --> 00:08:11,886
Really does look like a person.
Yeah.

75
00:08:12,487 --> 00:08:14,682
Must be all full of wires inside.

76
00:08:14,767 --> 00:08:18,396
No, you cut him open,
there's blood, guts the whole thing.

77
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:20,046
It's sweating.

78
00:08:24,767 --> 00:08:27,725
Well, I'll be. Look at that.

79
00:08:30,087 --> 00:08:33,443
God, they go through a lot of trouble
to imitate people.

80
00:08:33,527 --> 00:08:36,724
Why do you think they do that?
I don't care why.

81
00:08:37,447 --> 00:08:40,120
But the fact
that these things sweat...

82
00:08:41,447 --> 00:08:43,358
now that's interesting.

83
00:08:58,887 --> 00:09:00,161
Sleeping?

84
00:09:04,407 --> 00:09:05,635
Praying.

85
00:09:08,127 --> 00:09:11,563
I don't think
the Gods answer the prayers of toasters.

86
00:09:12,607 --> 00:09:14,882
God answers everyone's prayers.

87
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:20,397
- How many Cylons are there in the fleet?
- We haven't been properly introduced.

88
00:09:24,887 --> 00:09:26,240
I'm Leoben.

89
00:09:26,487 --> 00:09:30,082
How many Cylons in the fleet?
I have no idea.

90
00:09:31,607 --> 00:09:33,199
What's your name?

91
00:09:33,287 --> 00:09:35,357
How long have you been hiding
aboard this ship?

92
00:09:35,447 --> 00:09:37,278
Am I not allowed to know your name?

93
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:40,677
Why were you hiding here?
I had a mission to perform.

94
00:09:40,767 --> 00:09:44,362
<i>Listen, it's a small thing.
Can you just tell me who you are?</i>

95
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:48,195
Tell me about your mission
and I'll think about it.

96
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:52,041
- My mission was to conduct sabotage.
- What kind of sabotage?

97
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:54,680
God, you stink.

98
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,520
Can I get some air in here?
Between you and the humidity.

99
00:10:00,607 --> 00:10:03,485
I am not here
to play games with you.

100
00:10:04,287 --> 00:10:08,565
You said you wanted to cooperate.
Either start talking or we are done.

101
00:10:09,927 --> 00:10:11,042
Okay.

102
00:10:12,127 --> 00:10:13,276
But...

103
00:10:14,607 --> 00:10:16,837
I really wanna know your name.

104
00:10:20,767 --> 00:10:21,882
Open.

105
00:10:23,087 --> 00:10:24,884
Are you Lt. Starbuck?

106
00:10:29,047 --> 00:10:30,480
Yes, you are.

107
00:10:30,807 --> 00:10:32,126
I knew...

108
00:10:34,887 --> 00:10:36,161
I was right.

109
00:10:36,247 --> 00:10:39,159
<i>I was right. I saw it. I've seen it.</i>

110
00:10:39,967 --> 00:10:43,084
- Happy now?
- It all makes sense now.

111
00:10:43,967 --> 00:10:45,320
Doesn't it?

112
00:10:45,967 --> 00:10:49,437
Now we can talk.
Now we can talk about a lot of things.

113
00:10:53,767 --> 00:10:55,086
Like what?

114
00:10:56,807 --> 00:11:00,163
I planted a nuclear warhead
aboard one of your ships.

115
00:11:02,327 --> 00:11:05,205
It's set to go off at 1830 hours.

116
00:11:08,967 --> 00:11:10,116
Where?

117
00:11:11,647 --> 00:11:13,205
I'm not ready to give that up yet.

118
00:11:13,287 --> 00:11:15,243
You're lying. There's no warhead.

119
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,636
You can't take the chance, Starbuck.

120
00:11:17,727 --> 00:11:22,562
Your military training dictates you take it
to your masters and let them decide.

121
00:11:22,967 --> 00:11:25,800
Maybe my training wasn't so good.

122
00:11:26,927 --> 00:11:31,239
Maybe I push you out the air lock,
and tell them you never said a word.

123
00:11:32,767 --> 00:11:33,961
Now, who's lying.

124
00:11:34,047 --> 00:11:36,402
<i>These things happen for a reason,
don't they?</i>

125
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,762
I'm looking forward
to spending more time with you.

126
00:11:38,847 --> 00:11:40,678
<i>We have a lot to talk about.</i>

127
00:11:42,007 --> 00:11:43,326
It's gonna be fun.

128
00:11:46,447 --> 00:11:48,915
Put the Red Team
on alert immediately. Dee?

129
00:11:49,007 --> 00:11:51,919
<i>And sweep Galactica
for any kind of radiological devices.</i>

130
00:11:52,007 --> 00:11:53,156
Right.

131
00:11:54,327 --> 00:11:56,397
Contact all the captains in the fleet.

132
00:11:56,487 --> 00:11:58,921
Have them do radiological sweeps
of their ships.

133
00:11:59,007 --> 00:12:01,316
But emphasize that this is
just a precaution.

134
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,841
I don't wanna alarm anyone
until we're sure.

135
00:12:03,927 --> 00:12:05,201
Yes, sir.

136
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:09,123
Well, we'll know for sure
in 8 hours and 40 minutes.

137
00:12:09,207 --> 00:12:11,198
Lt. Thrace, did he say anything else?

138
00:12:11,687 --> 00:12:12,756
No.

139
00:12:14,047 --> 00:12:16,322
He guessed my call sign.

140
00:12:17,207 --> 00:12:19,323
Seemed really happy
when he found out who I was.

141
00:12:19,407 --> 00:12:20,920
<i>He's playing with your mind.</i>

142
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:23,919
He's been stowed away for weeks
aboard the fleet.

143
00:12:24,007 --> 00:12:27,602
<i>Fifty ways he could've heard
the word "Starbuck" on a wireless set.</i>

144
00:12:27,687 --> 00:12:28,802
That's what I figured, sir.

145
00:12:31,407 --> 00:12:32,999
Any idea what he wants?

146
00:12:33,087 --> 00:12:34,236
Not yet.

147
00:12:34,327 --> 00:12:37,239
Says he's looking forward
to spending some time with me, though.

148
00:12:37,327 --> 00:12:39,158
Don't take any chances, Starbuck.

149
00:12:39,487 --> 00:12:40,761
Yes, sir.

150
00:12:44,687 --> 00:12:47,804
You believe in the Gods, don't you?
Lords of Kobol, and all that?

151
00:12:47,887 --> 00:12:49,718
Why should I tell you?

152
00:12:50,127 --> 00:12:53,119
It's not a trick question.
I wanted to see how much I got right.

153
00:12:53,207 --> 00:12:55,641
So you pray to Artemis, Aphrodite?

154
00:12:56,127 --> 00:12:57,879
Where's the warhead?

155
00:12:59,727 --> 00:13:01,126
I was right.

156
00:13:01,767 --> 00:13:04,759
See, our faiths are similar,
but I look to one God, not to many.

157
00:13:04,847 --> 00:13:06,883
I don't give a damn about what you believe.

158
00:13:06,967 --> 00:13:10,243
To know the face of God,
is to know madness.

159
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:16,522
I see the universe.

160
00:13:17,687 --> 00:13:19,598
I see the patterns.

161
00:13:20,447 --> 00:13:24,406
I see the foreshadowing
that precedes every moment of every day.

162
00:13:24,767 --> 00:13:27,918
It's all there. I see it. And you don't.

163
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,962
And I have a surprise for you.

164
00:13:31,047 --> 00:13:34,039
I have something to tell you
about the future.

165
00:13:34,167 --> 00:13:37,443
Is that so?
It is.

166
00:13:38,287 --> 00:13:40,642
But we have to see this thing through
till the end.

167
00:14:01,527 --> 00:14:04,280
What is the most basic article of faith?

168
00:14:05,047 --> 00:14:07,197
This is not all that we are.

169
00:14:09,847 --> 00:14:13,396
The difference between you and me is,
I know what that means and you don't.

170
00:14:13,487 --> 00:14:16,559
I know that I'm more than this body,
this consciousness.

171
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,205
A part of me swims in the stream.

172
00:14:18,287 --> 00:14:23,042
But in truth, I'm standing on the shore.
The current never takes me downstream.

173
00:14:23,367 --> 00:14:27,485
<i>This is worse than Galactica.
And I didn't think that was possible.</i>

174
00:14:28,287 --> 00:14:31,597
And what was that?
Swimming in streams or something?

175
00:14:33,287 --> 00:14:34,686
Do you mind?

176
00:14:40,887 --> 00:14:42,206
Thank you.

177
00:14:45,687 --> 00:14:47,996
Starving. Haven't eaten in days.

178
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:52,160
Kind of bad programming, isn't it?
I mean, why bother with hunger?

179
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:56,044
- Part of being human.
- You're not human.

180
00:14:59,007 --> 00:15:00,645
How's your lunch?

181
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:03,485
You know how it is.

182
00:15:05,007 --> 00:15:07,885
When you're starving, anything tastes good.

183
00:15:21,367 --> 00:15:22,846
Did that hurt?

184
00:15:25,087 --> 00:15:26,679
Yeah, that hurt.

185
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:31,122
Machines shouldn't feel pain...

186
00:15:31,567 --> 00:15:33,239
shouldn't bleed...

187
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,479
shouldn't sweat.

188
00:15:37,407 --> 00:15:39,796
Sweat. That's funny. That's good.

189
00:15:41,327 --> 00:15:45,115
See, a smart Cylon would turn off
the old pain software about now.

190
00:15:45,207 --> 00:15:47,516
But I don't think you're so smart.

191
00:15:47,607 --> 00:15:50,644
Maybe I'll turn it off
and you won't even know.

192
00:15:55,687 --> 00:15:57,359
Here's your dilemma.

193
00:15:57,447 --> 00:16:01,599
Turn off the pain, you feel better,
but that makes you a machine, not a person.

194
00:16:01,687 --> 00:16:04,804
You see, human beings
can't turn off their pain.

195
00:16:06,607 --> 00:16:08,757
Human beings have to suffer...

196
00:16:08,847 --> 00:16:12,635
and cry, and scream, and endure...

197
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:14,799
because they have no choice.

198
00:16:14,887 --> 00:16:17,879
<i>So the only way you can avoid the pain
you're about to receive...</i>

199
00:16:17,967 --> 00:16:20,162
<i>is by telling me exactly what I wanna know.</i>

200
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:22,203
Just like a human would.

201
00:16:24,887 --> 00:16:26,718
I knew this about you.

202
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:30,885
You're everything I thought you would be.

203
00:16:31,007 --> 00:16:33,919
But it won't work. I won't tell you anything.

204
00:16:34,007 --> 00:16:35,326
Maybe not.

205
00:16:36,247 --> 00:16:39,444
But then, you'll know deep down
that I beat you...

206
00:16:39,847 --> 00:16:42,077
that a human being beat you...

207
00:16:42,487 --> 00:16:45,479
and that you are truly no greater
than we are.

208
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:48,400
You're just a bunch of machines after all.

209
00:16:51,607 --> 00:16:53,359
Let the games begin.

210
00:17:04,327 --> 00:17:05,362
Hi.

211
00:17:14,087 --> 00:17:16,555
Well, look what the cat dragged in.

212
00:17:17,527 --> 00:17:18,926
Lt. Valerii.

213
00:17:20,847 --> 00:17:22,838
It's an unexpected visit.

214
00:17:23,887 --> 00:17:25,605
You look wonderful.

215
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,686
I need your help.
Anything I can do.

216
00:17:36,487 --> 00:17:38,045
Anything at all.

217
00:17:38,127 --> 00:17:40,038
Wonder why they call her "Boomer"?

218
00:17:40,127 --> 00:17:42,163
I heard you were working on a test...

219
00:17:42,247 --> 00:17:45,045
to tell the difference
between Cylons and humans.

220
00:17:45,127 --> 00:17:46,242
Bingo.

221
00:17:46,327 --> 00:17:49,160
I can't really talk about that at the moment.

222
00:17:49,247 --> 00:17:52,398
You wouldn't help settle a bet for me,
would you?

223
00:17:52,887 --> 00:17:56,118
Why do they call you "Boomer"?

224
00:17:57,687 --> 00:18:02,556
If you're working on a Cylon detector,
do you think I could be in the first batch?

225
00:18:02,647 --> 00:18:03,921
You know, to be tested?

226
00:18:04,007 --> 00:18:06,475
- What's her rush?
- What's your rush?

227
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,445
I'm not sure it would be
appropriate to show favouritism...

228
00:18:10,527 --> 00:18:12,882
if indeed I am working on anything at all.

229
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,639
I saved your life back on Caprica.

230
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:19,596
<i>My co-pilot gave up his seat for you.
I brought you back to Galactica, to safety.</i>

231
00:18:19,727 --> 00:18:23,356
You wouldn't even be here
if it wasn't for me. You owe me.

232
00:18:25,847 --> 00:18:28,759
She shoots. She scores.

233
00:18:31,247 --> 00:18:34,398
I suppose there's some
small truth to that.

234
00:18:36,007 --> 00:18:37,998
So can you test me or not?

235
00:18:38,127 --> 00:18:40,118
I think you should do it.

236
00:18:40,447 --> 00:18:43,484
Results will be quite intriguing.

237
00:18:44,327 --> 00:18:47,842
The technology
for Cylon detection...

238
00:18:49,327 --> 00:18:52,478
is not quite ready
for full-scale implementation.

239
00:18:56,167 --> 00:18:58,681
But I could use a beta test subject.

240
00:19:16,207 --> 00:19:17,686
Sharon's late.

241
00:19:18,247 --> 00:19:19,680
Half an hour.

242
00:19:21,647 --> 00:19:24,320
I notice you're calling her Sharon now.

243
00:19:24,407 --> 00:19:26,716
Yeah, I choose to think of her
as one of them.

244
00:19:26,807 --> 00:19:28,763
Because you dislike her?

245
00:19:30,487 --> 00:19:32,876
Because in the scheme of things,
we are as we do.

246
00:19:32,967 --> 00:19:35,925
<i>She acts like one of them, thinks like them.</i>

247
00:19:36,687 --> 00:19:38,120
She is one of them.

248
00:19:38,207 --> 00:19:41,916
But she's one of us.
It would be best to remember that.

249
00:19:49,687 --> 00:19:52,201
- We had sex.
- Congratulations.

250
00:19:52,807 --> 00:19:54,763
Does he love you?
I think so.

251
00:19:54,847 --> 00:19:57,077
No. 6: Has he said it?
Not directly.

252
00:19:58,687 --> 00:19:59,915
Then you're just guessing.

253
00:20:00,007 --> 00:20:01,918
Stay in your current location.

254
00:20:02,007 --> 00:20:03,804
<i>We're setting up a cabin for you nearby.</i>

255
00:20:03,887 --> 00:20:05,878
<i>Food, water, electricity. All the comforts.</i>

256
00:20:05,967 --> 00:20:09,323
Shouldn't be too hard to convince him
to stay and start a life together.

257
00:20:09,407 --> 00:20:11,045
If not, kill him.

258
00:20:11,847 --> 00:20:13,599
Can you handle that?

259
00:20:27,487 --> 00:20:29,717
We made it this far, we'll make it all the way.

260
00:20:29,807 --> 00:20:32,719
Something happened to you,
I wouldn't know how to deal with it.

261
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:34,035
Caprica.

262
00:20:37,407 --> 00:20:39,204
<i>If he flees, he dies.</i>

263
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:42,445
<i>Does he love you?</i>

264
00:20:45,687 --> 00:20:46,802
Helo.

265
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:51,559
Hey, what's going on?
Come on. We gotta go. Now.

266
00:20:51,647 --> 00:20:53,365
I saw Cylons. They're heading this way.

267
00:20:53,447 --> 00:20:55,517
We got to travel fast,
even faster than before.

268
00:20:55,607 --> 00:20:58,883
- Why? What's different?
- Everything. Just trust me.

269
00:20:59,647 --> 00:21:00,762
I do.

270
00:21:07,807 --> 00:21:09,445
Now, if you were human...

271
00:21:09,527 --> 00:21:13,236
you'd be just about ready
to start offering up some false information...

272
00:21:13,327 --> 00:21:15,124
about the location of the nuke.

273
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:19,325
Some tiny thing that may get
you a reward and spare you some of this.

274
00:21:19,407 --> 00:21:22,365
But then I keep forgetting you're not human.

275
00:21:25,487 --> 00:21:27,125
You're a machine.

276
00:21:28,327 --> 00:21:29,726
I am more...

277
00:21:30,447 --> 00:21:33,200
than you could ever imagine.

278
00:21:35,287 --> 00:21:36,561
I am God.

279
00:21:38,807 --> 00:21:40,638
I'm sorry. You're God?

280
00:21:43,527 --> 00:21:45,563
Wow. Nice to meet you.

281
00:21:46,127 --> 00:21:49,756
That's good.
We'll give you a couple of minutes with that.

282
00:21:49,887 --> 00:21:52,685
It's funny, isn't it?

283
00:21:54,607 --> 00:21:56,916
We're all God, Starbuck. All of us.

284
00:21:57,007 --> 00:21:59,567
<i>I see the love
that binds all living things together.</i>

285
00:21:59,647 --> 00:22:00,762
Love?

286
00:22:01,367 --> 00:22:03,437
You don't even know what the word means.

287
00:22:03,527 --> 00:22:07,315
I know that God loved you
more than all other living creatures...

288
00:22:07,407 --> 00:22:10,797
and you repaid his divine love with sin...

289
00:22:10,887 --> 00:22:14,846
with hate, corruption, evil.

290
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,203
So then he decided to create the Cylons.

291
00:22:17,287 --> 00:22:21,485
The Gods had nothing to do with it.
We created you. Us.

292
00:22:21,727 --> 00:22:25,242
It was a stupid, fracked up decision,
and we have paid for it.

293
00:22:25,327 --> 00:22:28,478
You slaughtered my entire civilisation.

294
00:22:28,567 --> 00:22:32,480
That is sin. That is evil. And you are evil.

295
00:22:35,447 --> 00:22:36,562
Am I?

296
00:22:38,047 --> 00:22:41,323
I see the truths
that float past you in the stream.

297
00:22:43,927 --> 00:22:47,158
You have a real thing
about rivers and streams, don't you?

298
00:22:47,247 --> 00:22:50,364
I think we should indulge you
in your obsession.

299
00:23:01,887 --> 00:23:05,516
Do you realise I could kill you
before they came back in the room?

300
00:23:05,607 --> 00:23:07,279
I could get to my feet...

301
00:23:07,367 --> 00:23:09,756
rip your skull from your spinal column...

302
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:11,599
crash through that door...

303
00:23:11,687 --> 00:23:15,999
kill the guard in less time
than it has taken me to describe it to you.

304
00:23:16,127 --> 00:23:17,845
Then why don't you?

305
00:23:21,127 --> 00:23:22,799
It's not the time.

306
00:23:35,007 --> 00:23:36,360
He's loose!

307
00:23:39,567 --> 00:23:40,841
I have a surprise for you.

308
00:23:47,887 --> 00:23:49,639
You fracked up, pal.

309
00:23:52,287 --> 00:23:54,243
Now the gloves come off.

310
00:24:14,647 --> 00:24:16,080
Combat, Col. Tigh.

311
00:24:16,167 --> 00:24:17,725
<i>How's the search going
for the nuke?</i>

312
00:24:17,807 --> 00:24:19,525
Nothing so far.

313
00:24:19,607 --> 00:24:22,883
<i>How much time remaining?
2 hours, 9 minutes.</i>

314
00:24:33,687 --> 00:24:34,802
Spread out the fleet.

315
00:24:35,047 --> 00:24:38,039
<i>No ship more than 500 clicks
from any other ship.</i>

316
00:24:38,127 --> 00:24:41,563
<i>- If there's a nuke, let's limit the damage.
- Aye, sir.</i>

317
00:24:55,407 --> 00:24:56,442
No.

318
00:25:20,607 --> 00:25:21,756
Do it.

319
00:25:27,687 --> 00:25:29,006
Leave him.

320
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:35,836
Sir?

321
00:25:41,287 --> 00:25:42,959
Tell me where the warhead is...

322
00:25:43,047 --> 00:25:45,277
otherwise you're gonna drown
in that bucket.

323
00:25:45,367 --> 00:25:48,165
I can't drown. I can't die.

324
00:25:49,407 --> 00:25:50,476
Right.

325
00:25:50,567 --> 00:25:53,035
Commander Adama mentioned
that how if your body dies...

326
00:25:53,127 --> 00:25:56,164
your consciousness is downloaded
or transferred into another body.

327
00:25:56,247 --> 00:25:57,316
<i>Something like that.</i>

328
00:25:57,407 --> 00:25:58,635
No, exactly like that.

329
00:25:58,727 --> 00:26:00,479
See, I've been thinking.

330
00:26:01,007 --> 00:26:03,646
Why is a Cylon willing to talk at all?

331
00:26:03,727 --> 00:26:05,877
<i>Why does he care if we destroy his body?</i>

332
00:26:05,967 --> 00:26:10,677
Won't he just transfer away and laugh
at all of us and our stupid human ideas?

333
00:26:21,367 --> 00:26:23,562
Tell me where the warhead is.

334
00:26:25,047 --> 00:26:28,835
This is not your path, Starbuck.
You have a different destiny.

335
00:26:28,927 --> 00:26:30,645
Don't interrupt me.

336
00:26:30,767 --> 00:26:34,237
You see, I'm gonna dazzle you
with my poor human brain.

337
00:26:34,607 --> 00:26:37,121
You see, I think that you're afraid.

338
00:26:37,687 --> 00:26:39,996
<i>You're afraid that we're a long way
from home.</i>

339
00:26:40,087 --> 00:26:42,521
What if you don't transfer all the way back?

340
00:26:42,607 --> 00:26:45,440
What if when you die here, you really die?

341
00:26:46,447 --> 00:26:49,564
It's your chance to find out
if you're really God...

342
00:26:49,647 --> 00:26:52,241
or just a bunch of circuits
with a bad haircut.

343
00:26:52,327 --> 00:26:53,965
I'm not afraid of dying.

344
00:26:54,047 --> 00:26:58,677
Someone's programmed you with a fairytale
of God, and streams, and life ever after.

345
00:26:58,767 --> 00:27:01,122
But somewhere in that hard drive
you call a brain...

346
00:27:01,207 --> 00:27:02,526
is a beeping message:

347
00:27:02,607 --> 00:27:05,599
"Error, error. Does not compute.

348
00:27:06,527 --> 00:27:09,997
"I don't have a soul. I have software.

349
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:14,045
"If I die, I'm gone. "

350
00:27:31,527 --> 00:27:33,006
I have a soul.

351
00:27:33,807 --> 00:27:35,320
I see patterns.

352
00:27:35,607 --> 00:27:36,960
<i>I know you.</i>

353
00:27:37,047 --> 00:27:38,400
<i>You're damaged.</i>

354
00:27:38,487 --> 00:27:40,125
<i>You were born to a woman...</i>

355
00:27:40,207 --> 00:27:44,519
who believed suffering was good
for the soul, so you suffered.

356
00:27:45,527 --> 00:27:48,166
<i>Your life is a testament to pain.</i>

357
00:27:48,727 --> 00:27:50,957
<i>Injuries. Accidents.</i>

358
00:27:51,367 --> 00:27:55,485
Some inflicted upon others,
others inflicted upon yourself.

359
00:27:56,287 --> 00:27:57,606
<i>It surrounds you like a bubble.</i>

360
00:27:57,687 --> 00:28:00,565
<i>But it's not real, it's just...</i>

361
00:28:01,207 --> 00:28:04,005
It's just something she put in your head.

362
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:08,077
It's something that you wanna believe
because it means...

363
00:28:08,527 --> 00:28:11,883
you're the problem,
not the world that you live in.

364
00:28:11,967 --> 00:28:16,245
<i>You wanna believe it
because it means that you're bad luck.</i>

365
00:28:16,967 --> 00:28:19,879
<i>You're like a cancer
that needs to be removed.</i>

366
00:28:19,967 --> 00:28:22,561
Because you hear her voice every day.

367
00:28:23,647 --> 00:28:25,842
<i>And you want her to be right.</i>

368
00:28:29,767 --> 00:28:31,166
Start again.

369
00:28:53,327 --> 00:28:57,002
Now, we just pop this in the slot
and wait for the results.

370
00:28:58,727 --> 00:29:01,195
Green, you're a normal human being.

371
00:29:01,287 --> 00:29:03,721
Red, you're an evil Cylon.

372
00:29:08,487 --> 00:29:10,796
Should take a couple of minutes.

373
00:29:12,007 --> 00:29:16,000
So tell me, are you from Aerilon?

374
00:29:16,327 --> 00:29:18,522
There's a slight trace of an accent there.

375
00:29:18,607 --> 00:29:22,043
What? No. Troy.
Troy.

376
00:29:23,487 --> 00:29:26,126
Tell me, why is that familiar?

377
00:29:26,487 --> 00:29:28,159
Mining settlement.

378
00:29:29,207 --> 00:29:30,606
The accident.

379
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:33,485
The explosion. Right.

380
00:29:34,967 --> 00:29:36,559
That was tragic.

381
00:29:37,967 --> 00:29:40,765
Your family?
They died with the rest.

382
00:29:41,967 --> 00:29:43,480
I'm very sorry.

383
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:49,640
It's a lie.

384
00:29:53,047 --> 00:29:57,279
Congratulations, Doctor.
You've just uncovered your very first Cylon.

385
00:29:59,687 --> 00:30:03,521
Now, here's an interesting moment
in the life of Gaius Baltar.

386
00:30:04,207 --> 00:30:05,799
What will he do?

387
00:30:10,207 --> 00:30:12,767
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

388
00:30:13,487 --> 00:30:15,796
<i>Yeah, I'm just interpolating the results.</i>

389
00:30:15,887 --> 00:30:18,959
The question is,
what will she do if you expose her?

390
00:30:19,047 --> 00:30:20,765
Thank you or kill you?

391
00:30:20,847 --> 00:30:22,360
I thought it was just green or red.

392
00:30:22,447 --> 00:30:25,564
Well, it's a little more complicated than that.

393
00:30:25,927 --> 00:30:27,963
She probably doesn't know.

394
00:30:28,047 --> 00:30:30,607
<i>She probably thinks she's just another girl
from Troy...</i>

395
00:30:30,687 --> 00:30:33,838
<i>whose entire background vanished
in a mysterious accident.</i>

396
00:30:33,927 --> 00:30:36,077
<i>Should be interesting to see
how she responds...</i>

397
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,998
<i>when you tell her the truth.</i>

398
00:30:39,487 --> 00:30:42,524
I'm guessing her Cylon side will take over
and break your neck...

399
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:44,643
before you can give away her secret.

400
00:30:44,727 --> 00:30:46,240
<i>Let's find out.</i>

401
00:30:49,207 --> 00:30:51,357
Congratulations, it's green.

402
00:30:51,687 --> 00:30:53,598
It's very bright green.

403
00:30:54,527 --> 00:30:56,199
- You're not a Cylon.
- Really?

404
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:59,757
100% human, and very bright green as well.

405
00:31:00,847 --> 00:31:03,441
For a second,
I was worried what you were gonna say.

406
00:31:03,527 --> 00:31:04,801
Were you?
Yeah.

407
00:31:04,887 --> 00:31:08,038
Well, there's nothing
to be worried about anymore.

408
00:31:08,127 --> 00:31:11,039
You couldn't be more human
if you tried.

409
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:14,085
- Well, thanks.
- Anytime.

410
00:31:23,647 --> 00:31:24,841
I have something to tell you.

411
00:31:31,287 --> 00:31:34,165
How long before this supposed bomb
goes off?

412
00:31:34,607 --> 00:31:35,676
Less than an hour.

413
00:31:35,767 --> 00:31:38,156
<i>Get me a shuttle.
I'm going to the Gemenon Traveller.</i>

414
00:31:38,247 --> 00:31:40,397
I want to see the Cylon myself.

415
00:31:40,487 --> 00:31:43,320
Madam President, you need to...
Don't even start.

416
00:31:43,407 --> 00:31:46,240
I don't wanna discuss this.
I've made my decision.

417
00:31:46,327 --> 00:31:48,966
Not until I get you a security detail.

418
00:31:57,407 --> 00:32:00,205
Enough. For frack's sake, let him breathe.

419
00:32:23,967 --> 00:32:25,685
You're really sick.

420
00:32:26,767 --> 00:32:30,840
You're not a person. You're a machine
that's enjoying its own pain.

421
00:32:30,927 --> 00:32:33,122
All this has happened before.

422
00:32:33,687 --> 00:32:35,996
And all of it will happen again.

423
00:32:37,167 --> 00:32:38,998
Don't quote scripture.

424
00:32:39,687 --> 00:32:41,917
You don't have the right to use those words.

425
00:32:42,007 --> 00:32:44,999
You kneel before idols and ask for guidance.

426
00:32:45,087 --> 00:32:48,124
But you can't see
that your destiny's already been written.

427
00:32:48,207 --> 00:32:51,995
Each of us plays a role.
Each time, a different role.

428
00:32:53,527 --> 00:32:57,805
Maybe the last time, I was the interrogator
and you were the prisoner.

429
00:32:59,127 --> 00:33:02,005
The players change,
the story remains the same.

430
00:33:02,087 --> 00:33:03,679
And this time...

431
00:33:04,327 --> 00:33:05,726
this time...

432
00:33:06,127 --> 00:33:10,405
your role is to deliver my soul to God.

433
00:33:11,607 --> 00:33:13,040
Do it for me.

434
00:33:13,127 --> 00:33:15,846
It's your destiny and mine.

435
00:33:17,967 --> 00:33:21,676
And I told you I had a surprise for you.
Are you ready?

436
00:33:23,567 --> 00:33:25,523
You're gonna find Kobol.

437
00:33:27,007 --> 00:33:30,886
Birthplace of us all.
Kobol will lead you to Earth.

438
00:33:32,727 --> 00:33:34,922
This is my gift to you, Kara.

439
00:33:37,767 --> 00:33:40,042
What the hell is going on here?

440
00:33:53,527 --> 00:33:56,724
What exactly is it that you are doing here?

441
00:33:57,167 --> 00:33:58,919
It's a machine, sir.

442
00:34:00,207 --> 00:34:04,439
- There's no limit to the tactics I can use.
- And where's the warhead?

443
00:34:04,847 --> 00:34:07,680
I don't know.
You don't know?

444
00:34:08,407 --> 00:34:11,843
You spent the last eight hours
torturing this man.

445
00:34:12,887 --> 00:34:14,320
<i>This machine.</i>

446
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:16,440
Whatever it is.

447
00:34:17,127 --> 00:34:21,086
And you don't have
a single piece of information to show for it.

448
00:34:21,327 --> 00:34:23,318
He thinks he can see the future.

449
00:34:23,407 --> 00:34:25,875
Says he knows our destiny, our fate.

450
00:34:27,527 --> 00:34:31,759
He says we're gonna find Kobol,
and that it's gonna lead us to Earth.

451
00:34:34,847 --> 00:34:37,520
Clean him up. There's not much time.

452
00:34:37,927 --> 00:34:39,201
Yes, sir.

453
00:35:01,007 --> 00:35:03,077
Do you know who I am?
Yes.

454
00:35:05,767 --> 00:35:08,565
I apologise for what you've been through.

455
00:35:09,447 --> 00:35:11,403
Take his restraints off.

456
00:35:13,887 --> 00:35:15,036
Do it.

457
00:35:27,087 --> 00:35:28,406
Thank you.

458
00:35:28,607 --> 00:35:30,086
I can do more.

459
00:35:32,007 --> 00:35:35,443
I can guarantee your safety.
I can order your release.

460
00:35:35,927 --> 00:35:37,246
We are running out of time.

461
00:35:37,327 --> 00:35:40,842
We have only four minutes left
until your bomb goes off.

462
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:44,245
I've come here to tell you...

463
00:35:44,327 --> 00:35:48,115
that this conflict between our peoples
does not have to continue.

464
00:35:48,767 --> 00:35:52,885
It can stop right here with us.
We have to trust each other.

465
00:35:54,087 --> 00:35:55,361
Trust me.

466
00:35:59,207 --> 00:36:01,198
I think you know you can.

467
00:36:02,287 --> 00:36:05,324
Tell me what I need to know,
and you will live.

468
00:36:08,487 --> 00:36:11,877
The warhead doesn't exist. I made it up.

469
00:36:13,807 --> 00:36:15,957
<i>Lieutenant was right. I was too far out.</i>

470
00:36:16,047 --> 00:36:20,723
I didn't wanna die, so when I got caught,
I made up a story to buy some time.

471
00:36:21,567 --> 00:36:22,716
I see.

472
00:36:25,167 --> 00:36:27,123
Thank you for the truth.

473
00:36:28,287 --> 00:36:31,563
Thank you, Madam President.

474
00:36:33,767 --> 00:36:36,281
Don't be too hard on Kara.
She was just doing her job.

475
00:36:36,367 --> 00:36:37,686
The military...

476
00:36:37,767 --> 00:36:40,759
they teach you to...

477
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:43,839
dehumanise people.

478
00:36:47,367 --> 00:36:49,801
I'll take that into consideration.

479
00:36:50,767 --> 00:36:52,723
No, stand down.

480
00:36:57,647 --> 00:37:00,719
Laura, I have something to tell you.

481
00:37:03,247 --> 00:37:04,885
Adama is a Cylon.

482
00:37:09,887 --> 00:37:11,002
Yeah.

483
00:37:30,927 --> 00:37:33,122
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

484
00:37:34,727 --> 00:37:37,446
- The bomb?
- Nothing.

485
00:37:41,207 --> 00:37:43,675
- Put him out the airlock.
- What?

486
00:37:45,007 --> 00:37:49,159
- You can't do that. Not after he told you...
- Yes, I can. And I will.

487
00:37:54,687 --> 00:37:56,598
<i>Lieutenant, look at me.</i>

488
00:37:58,087 --> 00:37:59,918
You've lost perspective.

489
00:38:00,007 --> 00:38:03,682
<i>During the time I have allowed him
to remain alive and captive on this ship...</i>

490
00:38:03,767 --> 00:38:07,362
he has caused our entire fleet
to spread out defenceless.

491
00:38:09,167 --> 00:38:12,159
<i>He puts insidious ideas in our minds.</i>

492
00:38:12,567 --> 00:38:14,762
<i>More lethal than any warhead.</i>

493
00:38:15,647 --> 00:38:17,239
He creates fear.

494
00:38:17,687 --> 00:38:20,406
<i>But you're right. He's a machine...</i>

495
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:23,521
and you don't keep
a deadly machine around.

496
00:38:23,607 --> 00:38:26,075
When it kills your people
and threatens your future...

497
00:38:26,167 --> 00:38:27,839
you get rid of it.

498
00:38:32,047 --> 00:38:33,958
He's not afraid to die.

499
00:38:38,047 --> 00:38:41,357
He's just afraid that his soul
won't make it to God.

500
00:40:07,207 --> 00:40:09,482
Lords of Kobol, hear my prayer.

501
00:40:11,527 --> 00:40:14,644
I don't know if he had a soul or not.

502
00:40:15,767 --> 00:40:18,042
But if he did, take care of it.

503
00:40:29,487 --> 00:40:31,717
Hell of a risk you took today.

504
00:40:32,007 --> 00:40:33,838
Something I had to do.

505
00:40:33,967 --> 00:40:35,719
Care to tell me why?

506
00:40:35,847 --> 00:40:37,519
President Adar once said...

507
00:40:37,607 --> 00:40:39,996
that the interesting thing
about being a President...

508
00:40:40,087 --> 00:40:43,443
is that you don't have to explain yourself
to anyone.

509
00:40:54,847 --> 00:40:56,439
Something wrong?

510
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:00,715
No. Nothing at all.
