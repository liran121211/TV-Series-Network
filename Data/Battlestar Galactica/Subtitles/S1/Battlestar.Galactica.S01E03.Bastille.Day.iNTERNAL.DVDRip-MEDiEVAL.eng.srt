1
00:00:02,287 --> 00:00:04,755
<i>Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.</i>

2
00:00:34,727 --> 00:00:37,161
<i>The captain of the Astral Queen
wants you to know...</i>

3
00:00:37,247 --> 00:00:39,158
he's got 1,500 prisoners under heavy guard.

4
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:42,398
Tell him I want daily reports
on the well-being of his prisoners.

5
00:00:42,487 --> 00:00:44,284
The President has given me a direct order.

6
00:00:44,367 --> 00:00:46,039
<i>We're in the middle of a war...</i>

7
00:00:46,127 --> 00:00:48,322
and you're taking orders
from a schoolteacher?

8
00:00:48,407 --> 00:00:52,002
Don't suppose there's a Plan B?
Plans B, C, D, E are the same as A.

9
00:00:52,087 --> 00:00:54,157
<i>Get off the planet and get back to the ship.</i>

10
00:00:54,247 --> 00:00:55,965
<i>How much water did we lose?</i>

11
00:00:56,047 --> 00:00:58,720
Almost 60% of total potable water reserves.

12
00:00:58,807 --> 00:01:02,482
If we don't find new supplies
they'll run out of water in two days.

13
00:01:09,287 --> 00:01:12,643
<i>Reveille,
morning stations aboard Battlestar Galactica.</i>

14
00:01:12,727 --> 00:01:14,479
<i>All hands report to your stations.</i>

15
00:01:45,887 --> 00:01:48,560
So, what do we have?
Good news, Colonel.

16
00:01:48,647 --> 00:01:51,400
We scouted the ice moon.
Found an entire subsurface ocean.

17
00:01:51,487 --> 00:01:53,284
<i>We've got reports and video for you.</i>

18
00:01:53,367 --> 00:01:55,642
Not exactly Caprica Beach
down there, Chief?

19
00:01:55,727 --> 00:01:58,844
No, sir. We've registered temperatures
180 and below...

20
00:01:59,047 --> 00:02:02,676
venting of methane and CO2.
It's gonna be a bitch to work down there, sir.

21
00:02:02,767 --> 00:02:05,964
Cheer up. You know how lucky we are
we found this ugly rock?

22
00:02:06,047 --> 00:02:09,517
Water riots breaking out
all over the fleet. Civilians.

23
00:02:10,127 --> 00:02:14,484
Whiney civie cry-babies can't stand
less than a hot shower every day.

24
00:02:14,887 --> 00:02:15,922
Yes, sir.

25
00:02:16,007 --> 00:02:18,805
<i>Even Galactica's down
to 10,000 JPs of water.</i>

26
00:02:20,567 --> 00:02:24,242
Ever see a man die of dehydration?
No, sir.

27
00:02:24,327 --> 00:02:27,160
Let's hope you never do. It isn't pretty.

28
00:02:29,247 --> 00:02:31,442
So, where were we?

29
00:02:32,727 --> 00:02:34,638
We drilled 23 core samples.

30
00:02:34,727 --> 00:02:39,437
13% sodium chloride. What the hell?
We can't drink salt water!

31
00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:42,599
No, sir. That's why I had Cally test the ice.

32
00:02:43,647 --> 00:02:46,400
Well, there you go. Pure water.

33
00:02:46,807 --> 00:02:49,605
Couple of lemons, we could make lemonade.

34
00:02:50,007 --> 00:02:51,281
Yes, sir.

35
00:02:52,367 --> 00:02:55,404
We'll have to melt the ice
before we transport it up to the ship.

36
00:02:55,487 --> 00:02:56,636
What's that gonna take?

37
00:02:56,727 --> 00:02:59,958
High-capacity heater expansion tanks,
D-25 plasma torches...

38
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:03,562
- Myrex hoses, centrifugal pumps.
- Sounds like a lot of manpower.

39
00:03:03,647 --> 00:03:05,319
Ideally 1,000 men, sir.

40
00:03:05,407 --> 00:03:07,841
One thousand men?
And where're they gonna come from?

41
00:03:07,927 --> 00:03:09,121
Slave labour.

42
00:03:09,207 --> 00:03:13,519
They are criminals. They've been sentenced
to hard labour. And this is very hard labour.

43
00:03:13,607 --> 00:03:17,566
Not to mention physically dangerous.
This is not for civilians, but...

44
00:03:18,207 --> 00:03:21,722
Their ship wasn't designed
for long-term incarceration.

45
00:03:21,807 --> 00:03:24,799
These men have been stuck
in cramped cells for weeks now.

46
00:03:24,887 --> 00:03:29,085
They might even prefer to get out.
Do something, even if it is dangerous.

47
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:33,240
If they volunteer. But these aren't slaves
and I will not have them treated as such.

48
00:03:33,327 --> 00:03:36,125
No. We could offer incentives.

49
00:03:36,887 --> 00:03:39,720
Points towards earning freedom.
Excuse me.

50
00:03:40,407 --> 00:03:44,161
You wanna start releasing
hardened criminals into the fleet?

51
00:03:44,287 --> 00:03:47,438
Sir, these men were on their way to Caprica
for parole hearings...

52
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:50,564
which at least implies
they may be ready for release.

53
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:54,083
- Make it happen, Captain.
- Yes, sir.

54
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:57,125
To address Commander Adama's
concerns, I'd like you to go along...

55
00:03:57,207 --> 00:04:00,563
and set up a screening procedure
to weed out the hardened criminals.

56
00:04:00,647 --> 00:04:03,525
<i>I would like to have a representative
from Galactica...</i>

57
00:04:03,607 --> 00:04:06,997
who will report directly to me
about security issues.

58
00:04:08,007 --> 00:04:09,406
How about D?

59
00:04:10,047 --> 00:04:12,925
Second Class Petty Officer Dualla.
I know who she is.

60
00:04:13,007 --> 00:04:15,567
I'm not sure she's conversant
with the technical details.

61
00:04:15,647 --> 00:04:18,525
She'll be fine, but we should send someone
from ground crew...

62
00:04:18,607 --> 00:04:21,246
who'll make sure the chosen men
know to use the equipment.

63
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:24,205
- Agreed.
- I have to get to the CIC. Excuse me.

64
00:04:24,287 --> 00:04:26,323
Madam President? The doctor.

65
00:04:26,407 --> 00:04:28,363
Excuse me?
The doctor?

66
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:33,515
<i>Commander, do you have a ship's doctor
aboard Galactica?</i>

67
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:38,237
- Maj. Cottle. Is there something wrong?
- No, nothing urgent. Allergies.

68
00:04:38,727 --> 00:04:42,197
He's out on the fleet
checking medical conditions.

69
00:04:42,607 --> 00:04:45,804
I'll tell him that you want to see him.
Thanks.

70
00:04:47,127 --> 00:04:51,279
Petty Officer Dualla.
Conversant in technical details.

71
00:04:52,047 --> 00:04:54,436
Thinking entirely of the mission.

72
00:04:57,767 --> 00:04:59,439
Something on your mind, Captain?

73
00:04:59,527 --> 00:05:02,564
I just thought maybe you had something
you wanted to say.

74
00:05:02,647 --> 00:05:06,560
I have nothing to say to
the personal representative of the President.

75
00:05:06,647 --> 00:05:09,036
<i>I'm still Galactica's lead pilot.</i>

76
00:05:09,647 --> 00:05:12,241
I have nothing to say to him, either.

77
00:05:14,327 --> 00:05:18,206
Every man has to decide for themselves
which side they're on.

78
00:05:19,927 --> 00:05:22,441
I didn't know we were picking sides.

79
00:05:25,567 --> 00:05:28,035
That's why you haven't picked one yet.

80
00:05:30,527 --> 00:05:32,518
<i>I'm a bus driver, not a warden.</i>

81
00:05:32,607 --> 00:05:34,723
How many total?
1,500.

82
00:05:35,207 --> 00:05:37,675
They don't give me their files
or their names.

83
00:05:37,767 --> 00:05:40,759
Hell, they're just numbers.
Thanks, Wilkens.

84
00:05:42,487 --> 00:05:45,559
All right. They're all yours.

85
00:05:53,327 --> 00:05:57,286
<i>I'm Capt. Lee Adama,
personal representative of the President.</i>

86
00:05:57,527 --> 00:05:59,199
<i>We're in a crisis.</i>

87
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:03,122
<i>Thousands of us are on the verge
of dying from dehydration.</i>

88
00:06:03,207 --> 00:06:05,846
<i>The good news is we have found water.</i>

89
00:06:06,727 --> 00:06:11,323
<i>The bad news is, it's located on a moon
with harsh environmental conditions.</i>

90
00:06:12,007 --> 00:06:15,556
<i>We need 1,000 able-bodied men
to help us get that water.</i>

91
00:06:16,407 --> 00:06:20,082
<i>President Roslin feels
that you represent our best chance.</i>

92
00:06:21,207 --> 00:06:24,199
<i>She also recognises that you are not slaves.</i>

93
00:06:24,807 --> 00:06:29,597
<i>Any man who volunteers to help us during
this emergency will earn "freedom points"...</i>

94
00:06:29,687 --> 00:06:32,804
<i>which can be applied
toward earning his release.</i>

95
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:35,761
<i>We're offering you a chance
for a new beginning.</i>

96
00:06:35,847 --> 00:06:39,476
<i>Whoever is interested,
please just step out of your cell.</i>

97
00:07:19,007 --> 00:07:20,998
Thank you for your offer.

98
00:07:22,167 --> 00:07:24,886
We respectfully decline.

99
00:07:24,967 --> 00:07:26,195
Zarek!

100
00:07:26,967 --> 00:07:29,527
Oh, my God, that's Tom Zarek.

101
00:07:31,247 --> 00:07:32,726
The terrorist?

102
00:07:33,767 --> 00:07:36,122
Zarek!

103
00:09:00,367 --> 00:09:03,962
So who the hell is Tom Zarek?
He's a freedom fighter.

104
00:09:04,847 --> 00:09:08,317
- He's a prisoner of conscience.
- He's a butcher.

105
00:09:08,407 --> 00:09:11,319
His colony was exploited
by the other 11 for centuries.

106
00:09:11,407 --> 00:09:13,398
His people were marginalised, brutalised...

107
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:16,320
I'm from Saggitaron,
and that man doesn't speak for all of us.

108
00:09:16,407 --> 00:09:19,205
He blew up a government building,
there's no excuse for that.

109
00:09:19,287 --> 00:09:23,485
Captain, I've been watching the clock and
if we won't get any help, we should move on.

110
00:09:23,567 --> 00:09:27,162
Zarek's got the prisoners united.
Let's go through Zarek.

111
00:09:33,327 --> 00:09:36,285
<i>Hello? Anybody out there?</i>

112
00:09:38,087 --> 00:09:40,760
<i>Anybody wanna help two stranded pilots?</i>

113
00:09:41,487 --> 00:09:44,718
That's what I hate about big cities.
No one will help you.

114
00:09:44,807 --> 00:09:47,685
No more shouting.
You're making me nervous.

115
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:50,558
Feel like I'm in a movie.

116
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:53,805
- At least it stopped raining.
- For now.

117
00:09:57,007 --> 00:09:58,679
Where is everyone?

118
00:09:59,607 --> 00:10:02,644
Some are dead. In their beds, at their desks.

119
00:10:03,567 --> 00:10:06,525
Ones who weren't killed outright
probably ran into the hills.

120
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,245
Won't do any good.

121
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:14,000
- Guess I'm getting a little...
- Depressing? Morbid?

122
00:10:14,087 --> 00:10:18,558
Sorry. Been here longer than you.
Wish I could say it gets easier.

123
00:10:24,447 --> 00:10:27,359
There's more.
Boomer, you might not wanna...

124
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:33,122
Frakking rats. Let's go.

125
00:10:36,087 --> 00:10:37,486
Come on.

126
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:41,324
Let's find a hospital,
score some anti-radiation meds, okay?

127
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:43,284
We've only got two days' worth left.

128
00:10:43,367 --> 00:10:46,962
Sharon, we've made it this far.
We're gonna make it all the way.

129
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:49,766
- Right.
- Damn straight, all the way.

130
00:10:49,887 --> 00:10:52,082
We're doing good, real good.

131
00:10:52,607 --> 00:10:55,485
I guess someone must be
watching out for us.

132
00:11:01,647 --> 00:11:03,000
She's good.

133
00:11:03,767 --> 00:11:05,280
- So far.
- Jealous?

134
00:11:06,687 --> 00:11:08,643
This all makes me makes so sad.

135
00:11:08,727 --> 00:11:12,402
They would've destroyed themselves
anyway. They deserve what they got.

136
00:11:12,487 --> 00:11:16,002
We're the children of humanity.
That makes them our parents, in a sense.

137
00:11:16,087 --> 00:11:18,920
True. But parents have to die.

138
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:22,841
It's the only way children
come into their own.

139
00:11:29,007 --> 00:11:31,043
No, that's not necessary.

140
00:11:34,087 --> 00:11:36,043
I'd like to talk to you.

141
00:11:37,127 --> 00:11:40,597
Guard. Prisoner 893893...

142
00:11:40,887 --> 00:11:43,526
requests permission
to speak with his visitor.

143
00:11:43,607 --> 00:11:44,835
Granted.

144
00:11:44,927 --> 00:11:48,602
We're not allowed to speak
unless asked a direct question.

145
00:11:48,847 --> 00:11:51,361
And you didn't ask me a direct question.

146
00:11:51,447 --> 00:11:54,519
You've never been
in a prison before, have you, Captain?

147
00:11:54,607 --> 00:11:56,484
No.
You're fortunate.

148
00:11:57,607 --> 00:11:59,882
- May I sit down?
- Yes, of course.

149
00:12:25,167 --> 00:12:26,998
We need these men of yours
to help us.

150
00:12:27,087 --> 00:12:30,159
They're not my men. They belong to you.

151
00:12:30,247 --> 00:12:35,196
I belong to you. You own us.
You're the master, we're the slaves.

152
00:12:44,367 --> 00:12:46,801
You're clearly a man of principle.

153
00:12:46,887 --> 00:12:49,003
I respect that.
Really?

154
00:12:49,607 --> 00:12:52,883
The things you've stood for over the years,
the book you wrote.

155
00:12:52,967 --> 00:12:55,561
The book that had to be smuggled
out of labour camp...

156
00:12:55,647 --> 00:12:58,957
because stumps aren't allowed
freedom of expression?

157
00:12:59,047 --> 00:13:00,878
I read it. In college.

158
00:13:01,687 --> 00:13:04,247
Thought it was radical, challenging.

159
00:13:05,207 --> 00:13:09,280
Made me question some things
I'd accepted before without thinking.

160
00:13:09,727 --> 00:13:11,604
Nice to hear I'm a big hit on campus.

161
00:13:11,687 --> 00:13:14,565
You weren't, the book was banned.
I read it anyway.

162
00:13:14,647 --> 00:13:18,686
Point is, I understand
where you're coming from.

163
00:13:18,767 --> 00:13:22,237
<i>But I don't think you understand
how critical the situation is out there.</i>

164
00:13:22,447 --> 00:13:24,642
People are gonna start dying.

165
00:13:26,767 --> 00:13:29,440
Hey, Starke. It's time for your break.

166
00:13:32,967 --> 00:13:35,322
How can you say that?
It's the truth.

167
00:13:35,407 --> 00:13:37,477
<i>Zarek and the SFM,
they don't care about justice.</i>

168
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,603
His people, your people
have been exploited.

169
00:13:39,687 --> 00:13:43,157
- You can't tell me about my people.
- I'm not telling you about your people.

170
00:13:43,247 --> 00:13:46,922
All I want, the President wants...

171
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:50,480
is to offer you a chance
to earn your freedom.

172
00:13:50,567 --> 00:13:55,118
Now you've said the truth: freedom is earned.

173
00:14:03,727 --> 00:14:06,799
Stay where you are, Captain.
It'll all be over soon.

174
00:14:10,807 --> 00:14:13,526
Nobody try anything! Back up!

175
00:14:42,647 --> 00:14:46,037
We've got the guards
and the crew in separate cells in Block 7.

176
00:14:46,127 --> 00:14:48,322
<i>Mason is looking after the hostages.</i>

177
00:14:48,407 --> 00:14:49,601
Nice job.

178
00:14:49,687 --> 00:14:51,643
Everything's under control.

179
00:14:51,727 --> 00:14:54,287
The men are organising exactly as planned.

180
00:14:54,487 --> 00:14:56,523
I knew I could count on you.

181
00:14:57,687 --> 00:15:00,884
Stay frosty there, Billy.
Everything's gonna be all right.

182
00:15:01,287 --> 00:15:02,402
I don't know about that.

183
00:15:02,487 --> 00:15:05,206
They don't wanna hurt us.
That won't get them what they want.

184
00:15:05,287 --> 00:15:06,276
Which is what?

185
00:15:11,727 --> 00:15:15,003
- Lt. Thrace. Good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

186
00:15:15,087 --> 00:15:16,566
Really?
No.

187
00:15:19,367 --> 00:15:20,595
Oh.

188
00:15:21,367 --> 00:15:24,359
- I wonder if she's a real blonde.
- I doubt it.

189
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:34,796
Now, one of you has been
coming in a little hot lately.

190
00:15:34,887 --> 00:15:37,242
A little too hot. A little... I don't know.

191
00:15:37,327 --> 00:15:39,921
He's burning up the deck
with his skids because...

192
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:43,363
he can't pull back on the throttle.
Who is the speed demon, my prince?

193
00:15:43,447 --> 00:15:44,641
Flat-Top, sir.

194
00:15:45,927 --> 00:15:48,964
Flat-Top.
You got a need for speed, do you?

195
00:15:49,367 --> 00:15:53,440
Can't wait to get back to the Big G
and the loving embrace of your fellow pilots?

196
00:15:53,527 --> 00:15:56,678
Or maybe you have a hot date
with your right hand.

197
00:15:57,367 --> 00:15:59,323
It never gets a headache.

198
00:16:00,287 --> 00:16:03,484
Tell you what, Flat-Top,
you come in too hot today...

199
00:16:03,567 --> 00:16:05,523
you may have to start using your left.

200
00:16:06,927 --> 00:16:10,840
All right. You've been fun,
you've been a great audience. Dismissed.

201
00:16:17,047 --> 00:16:20,562
There's no smoking in the ready room.
My room, my rules, sir.

202
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:23,445
- Where's your mummy?
- Dead. Where's yours?

203
00:16:24,007 --> 00:16:27,682
- I'm looking for Boomer.
- 1400. Boomer's in the tool room.

204
00:16:31,047 --> 00:16:34,483
A pilot blows his landings
and you make a joke out of it?

205
00:16:34,567 --> 00:16:37,479
Screaming at people
doesn't always get the best results, sir.

206
00:16:37,567 --> 00:16:39,558
I learned that at officer candidate school.

207
00:16:39,647 --> 00:16:43,003
You are right on the edge, Thrace.
Careful you don't fall off.

208
00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:44,759
Speaking of falling off...

209
00:16:45,967 --> 00:16:49,118
glad to see you've found a way
to quench your thirst.

210
00:17:01,167 --> 00:17:03,635
They won't negotiate
while you're holding hostages.

211
00:17:03,727 --> 00:17:07,436
- I don't wanna negotiate.
- Then what do you want?

212
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,882
To be treated like men, not animals.

213
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:14,321
- Finally have something to bargain with.
- So what happens now?

214
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,482
- We're gonna talk.
- What about?

215
00:17:23,447 --> 00:17:24,800
Your father.

216
00:17:26,967 --> 00:17:29,606
- Is this a Monclair original?
- Yes.

217
00:17:29,847 --> 00:17:32,486
Fantastic.
Would you like some water?

218
00:17:33,687 --> 00:17:35,405
Yes, thank you.

219
00:17:36,607 --> 00:17:39,246
I'm not a collector myself, but I...

220
00:17:39,847 --> 00:17:42,839
I am familiar with his work, and may I say...

221
00:17:43,087 --> 00:17:47,319
you really do have an excellent eye for art.
Thank you.

222
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:53,799
- Where's my Cylon detector, Doctor?
- Oh, that.

223
00:17:55,567 --> 00:17:59,640
Yes, it's taking longer
than expected, unfortunately.

224
00:18:02,767 --> 00:18:04,519
What's the hang-up?

225
00:18:05,207 --> 00:18:09,280
It's not working this time, Gaius.
He can see right through you.

226
00:18:09,847 --> 00:18:12,156
There are a number of obstacles...

227
00:18:12,447 --> 00:18:16,326
none of them insurmountable,
but they do tend to slow us down.

228
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:21,282
For a start, the lack of proper facilities.
The water shortage, of course.

229
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,325
The water shortage, not to mention...

230
00:18:23,407 --> 00:18:24,886
Cut the BS.

231
00:18:26,167 --> 00:18:29,477
You said you had a way of detecting
human from Cylon.

232
00:18:30,367 --> 00:18:32,164
Do you or don't you?

233
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,477
- I don't.
- What?

234
00:18:40,647 --> 00:18:43,719
I don't think that I'm the man for this job.

235
00:18:43,887 --> 00:18:45,957
I'm not cut out
for this kind of work.

236
00:18:46,047 --> 00:18:48,959
- You have to do this.
- Why do I keep putting it off?

237
00:18:49,047 --> 00:18:51,641
It's my subconscious telling me...

238
00:18:52,207 --> 00:18:54,675
that I'm not the man for this job, please.

239
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:58,601
Listen to me.
If you don't tell him what he wants to hear...

240
00:18:59,087 --> 00:19:01,157
he's going to find you out.

241
00:19:01,447 --> 00:19:04,166
And when he does,
they're going to tear your head off...

242
00:19:04,247 --> 00:19:06,238
and throw your body out of an air lock!

243
00:19:10,487 --> 00:19:15,436
Pardon me.
I haven't had much sleep recently, so...

244
00:19:19,207 --> 00:19:21,926
Unfortunately, Doctor, for both of us...

245
00:19:23,687 --> 00:19:25,882
you're the last man we have.

246
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,402
So what's the game plan, Doc?

247
00:19:33,727 --> 00:19:35,524
This is what you say:

248
00:19:36,407 --> 00:19:39,763
"Commander, the truth is, there is one way. "

249
00:19:40,807 --> 00:19:43,321
- Say it!
- Commander, the truth is...

250
00:19:44,247 --> 00:19:45,566
there is one way.

251
00:19:45,647 --> 00:19:48,525
I didn't wanna have to ask you for this...

252
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:51,246
but what I really need
to complete the project...

253
00:19:51,327 --> 00:19:53,966
is a nuclear...

254
00:19:54,647 --> 00:19:55,921
warhead.

255
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:03,685
That how you got to be the
"personal representative of the President?"

256
00:20:03,767 --> 00:20:07,316
Because of your father?
Hardly.

257
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:12,841
So, they don't get along, Adama and Roslin?

258
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,724
They have their differences.

259
00:20:14,807 --> 00:20:17,958
But not when it comes
to dealing with terrorists.

260
00:20:19,167 --> 00:20:22,682
I thought you said you respected me.
Read my book.

261
00:20:22,927 --> 00:20:26,681
That was before you resorted
to violence and hostage-taking.

262
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:29,845
Always better when the oppressed
don't fight back, isn't it?

263
00:20:30,447 --> 00:20:31,800
A warhead?

264
00:20:32,527 --> 00:20:35,200
Technically,
I need the plutonium inside.

265
00:20:35,287 --> 00:20:38,006
Technically, I need the plutonium inside.

266
00:20:38,087 --> 00:20:40,476
Figure out the rest for yourself.

267
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,641
As you may know, the Cylons are...

268
00:20:45,407 --> 00:20:47,716
susceptible to certain kinds of radiation...

269
00:20:47,807 --> 00:20:50,480
and by taking the plutonium...

270
00:20:55,847 --> 00:20:58,805
and embedding it
in a carbon nanotube matrix...

271
00:21:00,127 --> 00:21:02,357
and it really is that simple...

272
00:21:04,807 --> 00:21:08,686
I can construct a filter that will
preferentially ionise synthetic molecules...

273
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,281
and thus deliver to you your Cylons.

274
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:18,765
We have five warheads left aboard this ship.

275
00:21:25,127 --> 00:21:27,925
We may need them.
Yes, of course.

276
00:21:28,007 --> 00:21:31,204
If you really think that this project
has a low priority...

277
00:21:31,287 --> 00:21:34,279
then you're totally within your bounds to...

278
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:42,923
You'll get your warhead.

279
00:21:46,327 --> 00:21:47,601
Good boy.

280
00:21:48,327 --> 00:21:50,636
Thank you, Commander.

281
00:21:52,847 --> 00:21:57,363
Look, the master-at-arms
has been over every inch of that locker.

282
00:21:57,447 --> 00:21:59,324
She's come up with nothing.

283
00:21:59,407 --> 00:22:02,126
So they've got no idea
who took those six G-4 charges...

284
00:22:02,207 --> 00:22:05,677
- or who put that detonator in...
- Don't worry about it.

285
00:22:06,847 --> 00:22:08,883
I'll take care of it, okay?

286
00:22:15,687 --> 00:22:18,599
I need to speak with the Lieutenant, alone.

287
00:22:26,207 --> 00:22:29,995
You don't honestly think
you've been fooling everyone, do you?

288
00:22:30,087 --> 00:22:32,885
I know. The old man knows.

289
00:22:33,607 --> 00:22:36,519
Hell, the whole ship
knows about you and the Chief.

290
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:38,404
It stops. Now.

291
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:41,158
Sir, the Chief and I are just friends.

292
00:22:41,247 --> 00:22:43,966
When the ship was being decommissioned,
we let it go.

293
00:22:44,047 --> 00:22:47,517
Hell, we let people get away with murder.
That was then and this is now.

294
00:22:47,607 --> 00:22:50,724
We're at war, this is a combat unit
and you're his superior officer.

295
00:22:50,807 --> 00:22:53,196
Put a stop to it. That's an order.

296
00:22:54,487 --> 00:22:55,602
Yes, sir.

297
00:22:55,687 --> 00:22:58,042
<i>Attention.
Pass the word for Col. Tigh.</i>

298
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,322
<i>Col. Tigh, please report to the CIC.</i>

299
00:23:04,407 --> 00:23:08,286
<i>The crew are
my prisoners. They will not be harmed.</i>

300
00:23:08,727 --> 00:23:10,922
Are you recording this?
Yes, sir.

301
00:23:11,007 --> 00:23:12,918
What's this?
Trouble.

302
00:23:13,167 --> 00:23:16,876
<i>But I have
two conditions before I release my captives.</i>

303
00:23:17,047 --> 00:23:20,596
First, the government
which controls our fate...

304
00:23:21,207 --> 00:23:23,437
is illegal and illegitimate...

305
00:23:24,207 --> 00:23:27,244
<i>and it must submit to the will of the people.</i>

306
00:23:27,487 --> 00:23:30,081
<i>I demand the immediate resignation...</i>

307
00:23:30,327 --> 00:23:32,761
<i>of Laura Roslin and her ministers.</i>

308
00:23:33,647 --> 00:23:38,118
Second, I demand free and open
elections to choose a new leadership.

309
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:42,043
<i>And a new government
that represents all of the people.</i>

310
00:23:42,127 --> 00:23:46,962
<i>These demands are made not for me
or the former slaves held on this ship...</i>

311
00:23:47,447 --> 00:23:51,804
but for you,
the people, the survivors of the holocaust...

312
00:23:52,567 --> 00:23:56,116
<i>and the children of humanity's future.</i>

313
00:23:56,847 --> 00:23:58,485
I am Tom Zarek...

314
00:23:59,127 --> 00:24:02,403
and this is the first day of the new era.

315
00:24:05,207 --> 00:24:08,597
- We've jammed his transmissions.
- A little bit late for that.

316
00:24:08,687 --> 00:24:11,679
- Every ship in the fleet heard that broadcast.
- It doesn't matter.

317
00:24:11,767 --> 00:24:14,281
It does matter.
He's trying to bring down the government.

318
00:24:14,367 --> 00:24:16,358
<i>No one'll take it seriously.</i>

319
00:24:16,447 --> 00:24:19,837
You have something to learn when
it comes to public opinion, Commander.

320
00:24:19,927 --> 00:24:23,806
<i>Tom Zarek is a name with weight. He's
a very sympathetic figure. A legend, almost.</i>

321
00:24:23,887 --> 00:24:26,242
Twenty years in prison
over a matter of principle.

322
00:24:26,327 --> 00:24:29,364
He's a criminal and a terrorist.
People won't give him credence.

323
00:24:29,447 --> 00:24:31,085
<i>Don't be so sure, Commander.</i>

324
00:24:31,367 --> 00:24:35,565
Rebellions are contagious. People are
already rioting over the water crisis.

325
00:24:35,647 --> 00:24:38,639
<i>We can't afford
to destabilise this government right now.</i>

326
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:41,560
I agree.
When are you going in?

327
00:24:43,047 --> 00:24:45,277
I assumed you were gonna talk to him first.

328
00:24:45,367 --> 00:24:49,440
- We don't negotiate with terrorists.
- I said talk.

329
00:24:49,527 --> 00:24:52,917
There's nothing to talk about.
What he wants, I can't give him.

330
00:24:53,007 --> 00:24:56,317
We're not ready yet. Talking to Zarek
gives us a little bit more time.

331
00:24:56,407 --> 00:25:00,161
That's what he wants, legitimacy.
He wants to be recognised.

332
00:25:00,887 --> 00:25:03,162
He wants his crimes validated.

333
00:25:03,247 --> 00:25:06,557
I watched President Adar offer him
a full pardon if he'd apologise...

334
00:25:06,647 --> 00:25:10,606
and give up violence
as a means of political change. He refused.

335
00:25:14,927 --> 00:25:19,079
- No commitments. No deals.
- I'll let you know what happens.

336
00:25:21,327 --> 00:25:23,602
Three assault teams:
Alpha, Bravo, Constellation.

337
00:25:23,687 --> 00:25:27,282
We jam their dradis, the Raptors cut
through the hull here, here and here...

338
00:25:27,367 --> 00:25:29,756
without being seen.
Once we're inside, Alpha takes...

339
00:25:29,847 --> 00:25:31,075
What's this "we" crap?

340
00:25:31,167 --> 00:25:33,237
- I'm going, sir.
- Like hell.

341
00:25:34,167 --> 00:25:36,965
<i>We have a few marines left on Galactica.</i>

342
00:25:37,567 --> 00:25:40,365
- Let them handle it, Starbuck.
- They don't have a sniper.

343
00:25:40,447 --> 00:25:43,405
With all due respect, I'm the best shot
in or out of the cockpit.

344
00:25:43,487 --> 00:25:45,603
She's right. For once.

345
00:25:47,247 --> 00:25:49,044
Wonders never cease.

346
00:25:52,287 --> 00:25:54,243
All right, you're going in.

347
00:25:54,967 --> 00:25:59,324
You get a clear shot at Zarek, you take it.
I wanna control that ship immediately.

348
00:25:59,687 --> 00:26:02,838
- And I want all the hostages alive.
- Yes, sir.

349
00:26:03,607 --> 00:26:06,405
I don't even know how I drew this detail.

350
00:26:08,007 --> 00:26:12,603
- President thought you'd be valuable.
- President doesn't know who I am.

351
00:26:14,887 --> 00:26:17,276
I told her. Sorry.

352
00:26:19,087 --> 00:26:22,443
On the other hand,
it's nice to get out of the CIC.

353
00:26:22,527 --> 00:26:25,360
Break up the day, meet new people.

354
00:26:25,887 --> 00:26:26,876
Yeah.

355
00:26:33,447 --> 00:26:36,837
You're not asleep.
Not anymore.

356
00:26:38,007 --> 00:26:40,362
Is that your way of telling us
you're not scared?

357
00:26:40,447 --> 00:26:43,280
No, it's my way of telling you I'm tired.

358
00:26:44,967 --> 00:26:48,198
- You don't know what tired is.
- Right.

359
00:26:48,487 --> 00:26:52,036
Don't! Don't mock me, little girl.

360
00:26:53,367 --> 00:26:55,358
I'm not mocking you.

361
00:26:56,647 --> 00:26:59,923
Tom and I,
we go way back. Long time.

362
00:27:00,687 --> 00:27:04,077
If you know what's good for you,
you'll be nice to me.

363
00:27:16,487 --> 00:27:18,443
Frequent wireless contact.

364
00:27:18,607 --> 00:27:21,405
Keep us informed all the way.
Yes, sir.

365
00:27:21,567 --> 00:27:23,046
Good hunting.

366
00:27:29,527 --> 00:27:34,078
Who voted for Laura Roslin? You?
Did you vote for her?

367
00:27:34,167 --> 00:27:38,524
- She was sworn in under the law.
- The answer is, no one voted for her.

368
00:27:39,527 --> 00:27:42,883
And yet she's making decisions
for all of us, deciding who lives...

369
00:27:42,967 --> 00:27:47,199
and who dies. Is that democracy?
Is that a free society?

370
00:27:47,447 --> 00:27:49,358
What is it you want from me?

371
00:27:49,447 --> 00:27:52,917
You want me to say she shouldn't
be president? We need a government.

372
00:27:53,007 --> 00:27:57,637
- We need rules, we need a leader.
- We need to be free men and women.

373
00:27:57,887 --> 00:28:01,357
If we're not free,
then we're no different than Cylons.

374
00:28:05,127 --> 00:28:07,925
They call you Apollo.
It's my call sign.

375
00:28:08,207 --> 00:28:10,880
Apollo's one of the gods. A lord of Kobol.

376
00:28:10,967 --> 00:28:14,437
You must be a very special man
to be called a god.

377
00:28:14,887 --> 00:28:16,366
It's just a stupid nickname.

378
00:28:16,447 --> 00:28:20,759
Son of Zeus, good with the bow,
god of the hunt...

379
00:28:22,327 --> 00:28:24,716
and also a god of healing.

380
00:28:25,607 --> 00:28:26,926
Now, a god...

381
00:28:27,287 --> 00:28:31,121
can reconcile those two opposing forces,
but a mortal...

382
00:28:32,287 --> 00:28:35,563
has to pick one side or the other.

383
00:28:37,127 --> 00:28:39,482
Have you picked a side, Apollo?

384
00:28:40,447 --> 00:28:44,486
<i>Astral Queen, this is the Battlestar Galactica.</i>

385
00:28:44,967 --> 00:28:47,845
Commander Adama
wishes to speak to Mr. Zarek.

386
00:28:47,927 --> 00:28:51,203
<i>- Please respond.
- Zeus is calling.</i>

387
00:28:55,647 --> 00:28:58,844
<i>Commander Adama?
Tom Zarek. How can I help you?</i>

388
00:28:59,407 --> 00:29:03,002
First, I want to make sure
that my people are unharmed.

389
00:29:07,807 --> 00:29:10,196
This is Apollo. I'm fine, so are the others.

390
00:29:10,287 --> 00:29:13,404
They're located on the lower...
That's enough, thank you.

391
00:29:13,487 --> 00:29:16,001
I'm glad to hear that no one's been hurt.

392
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,555
That would have tragic consequences.

393
00:29:19,367 --> 00:29:23,042
- How long until you storm the ship?
- I'm hoping that won't be necessary.

394
00:29:24,127 --> 00:29:28,086
<i>I think that you and I can come up
with some kind of understanding.</i>

395
00:29:28,167 --> 00:29:31,159
This is not the only crisis
that I'm dealing with.

396
00:29:32,647 --> 00:29:35,400
The water shortage affects the entire fleet.

397
00:29:35,487 --> 00:29:38,320
Your men are on their way even as we speak.

398
00:29:38,567 --> 00:29:40,444
There's still time to work this out.

399
00:29:40,527 --> 00:29:43,200
Have the President step down
and call for elections.

400
00:29:43,287 --> 00:29:44,959
That's not gonna happen.

401
00:29:45,047 --> 00:29:47,117
Then I look forward to meeting your men.

402
00:30:12,567 --> 00:30:15,206
- I knew you were faking.
- I'm a light sleeper.

403
00:30:20,567 --> 00:30:24,640
- I don't think I have your respect.
- I respect you.

404
00:30:25,967 --> 00:30:27,116
Get up.

405
00:30:31,567 --> 00:30:33,364
Hey, what's going on?

406
00:30:35,127 --> 00:30:36,116
Hey!

407
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:44,677
- What are you doing?
- Move.

408
00:30:46,487 --> 00:30:48,443
Where are you taking her?

409
00:30:48,807 --> 00:30:51,560
<i>It's okay, Cally. You're gonna be okay.</i>

410
00:30:51,647 --> 00:30:55,276
- They know where we are, Cally.
- Capt. Adama!

411
00:30:55,607 --> 00:30:57,677
Hey! Capt. Adama!

412
00:30:57,767 --> 00:31:00,759
- They're willing to talk.
- Sounded that way.

413
00:31:04,127 --> 00:31:06,482
You want them to storm the ship.

414
00:31:09,727 --> 00:31:11,797
Soft seal. Pressurised.

415
00:31:14,367 --> 00:31:15,436
Eyes.

416
00:31:21,567 --> 00:31:23,319
That's it, isn't it?

417
00:31:23,967 --> 00:31:27,846
You don't want elections, you don't want
your freedom. You want a bloodbath.

418
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:29,519
You don't understand.

419
00:31:29,607 --> 00:31:32,724
Tom Zarek's been out of the headlines,
out of the news...

420
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:35,241
forgotten for 20 years as he rots in a cell.

421
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:38,763
Now he's got a chance to go out
in a blaze of glory...

422
00:31:38,847 --> 00:31:40,599
and he's gonna take it.

423
00:31:43,647 --> 00:31:45,524
Alpha One, we're in.

424
00:31:49,527 --> 00:31:52,439
Once Roslin uses Adama's soldiers...

425
00:31:52,527 --> 00:31:55,360
to massacre the people on this ship...

426
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:57,756
prisoners and hostages alike...

427
00:31:58,287 --> 00:32:02,041
people in the fleet will never forgive them.

428
00:32:02,767 --> 00:32:05,520
The entire government will collapse.

429
00:32:12,527 --> 00:32:16,315
- She can take care of herself.
- You sure?

430
00:32:17,367 --> 00:32:20,245
She's been trained.
We've all been trained in capture, it's...

431
00:32:25,407 --> 00:32:28,763
You've been saying
everything you're doing is for freedom.

432
00:32:28,847 --> 00:32:30,405
But the truth is...

433
00:32:30,487 --> 00:32:33,877
it's all about Tom Zarek
and his personal death wish.

434
00:32:35,087 --> 00:32:37,555
Tom. Something's up.

435
00:32:37,647 --> 00:32:40,480
Frakking bitch!
That's Mason. What the hell.

436
00:32:42,287 --> 00:32:44,596
They're killing the hostages. Let's go.

437
00:32:53,407 --> 00:32:55,318
Constellation Team, set.

438
00:32:56,567 --> 00:32:57,682
Mason!

439
00:32:59,527 --> 00:33:00,926
Mason, what're you doing?

440
00:33:01,007 --> 00:33:02,884
- Bit my ear off.
- Frak you!

441
00:33:02,967 --> 00:33:04,923
Open the door, she's been shot!

442
00:33:05,007 --> 00:33:07,760
You said they weren't animals.
What do you call this?

443
00:33:07,847 --> 00:33:10,281
Twenty years I've been waiting!

444
00:33:11,207 --> 00:33:13,243
He's gonna kill her. Do something.

445
00:33:13,327 --> 00:33:17,115
You did this! You put him in a cage!
You made him a monster!

446
00:33:20,847 --> 00:33:22,246
Bravo, set.

447
00:33:25,047 --> 00:33:26,719
You filthy bitch!

448
00:33:27,487 --> 00:33:29,318
You all deserve to die!

449
00:33:31,847 --> 00:33:33,041
You first.

450
00:33:35,287 --> 00:33:37,323
All teams, sniper in position.

451
00:33:37,727 --> 00:33:39,763
- He's gonna do it.
- You reap what you sow.

452
00:33:39,887 --> 00:33:44,517
You look at me. You see me! Look at me!

453
00:33:54,767 --> 00:33:57,804
Come on, Lee. Take out the son of a bitch.

454
00:34:00,887 --> 00:34:04,243
How about it, Tom?
You still have a death wish?

455
00:34:04,727 --> 00:34:08,163
You ready to leave this world,
right here, right now?

456
00:34:08,887 --> 00:34:10,878
- Yes.
- Too bad.

457
00:34:12,087 --> 00:34:13,998
'Cause this is what you're gonna do.

458
00:34:14,087 --> 00:34:17,523
You're gonna tell your men
to help us get that water off the moon.

459
00:34:17,607 --> 00:34:19,598
They're gonna work
for their points.

460
00:34:19,687 --> 00:34:22,838
And they're gonna earn
their freedom. And then...

461
00:34:26,487 --> 00:34:28,842
you're gonna get your elections.

462
00:34:32,087 --> 00:34:34,362
- What?
- 'Cause you're right, Tom.

463
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:40,359
You are right about democracy
and consent of the people.

464
00:34:41,647 --> 00:34:45,003
I believe in those things,
and we're gonna have them.

465
00:34:46,647 --> 00:34:48,717
And you can have them, too.

466
00:34:50,367 --> 00:34:53,677
Or you can have this bullet. Your call.

467
00:34:55,247 --> 00:34:57,556
What are you doing, Lee? Come on.

468
00:34:58,287 --> 00:35:00,517
How do I know your father...

469
00:35:01,087 --> 00:35:04,204
and the President will honour your word?

470
00:35:04,807 --> 00:35:06,126
You don't.

471
00:35:07,167 --> 00:35:10,682
You let the rest of the hostages go,
we'll leave this ship in your hands.

472
00:35:10,767 --> 00:35:14,999
They try and come after you,
you can still have your last stand.

473
00:35:16,287 --> 00:35:19,757
It's your choice. You reap what you sow.

474
00:35:23,687 --> 00:35:25,006
All right.

475
00:35:30,087 --> 00:35:31,805
Lower your weapons.

476
00:35:33,807 --> 00:35:35,957
Lower your weapons.
Do what he says.

477
00:35:36,047 --> 00:35:37,275
<i>Put them down.</i>

478
00:35:38,047 --> 00:35:39,321
Back off.

479
00:35:47,487 --> 00:35:51,275
Cally, you're gonna be okay.
You just hang in there, you hear?

480
00:35:51,767 --> 00:35:52,961
Got you.

481
00:36:00,607 --> 00:36:02,677
Cease fire!

482
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:06,881
Don't shoot!
All teams, hold positions.

483
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:09,435
Frak.

484
00:36:13,007 --> 00:36:16,522
- Thanks.
- I need a medic here.

485
00:36:21,127 --> 00:36:22,321
God.

486
00:36:25,247 --> 00:36:26,965
I don't believe this.

487
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,922
- It's unacceptable.
- It's done.

488
00:36:30,047 --> 00:36:32,686
<i>Prisoners have full control
of the Astral Queen.</i>

489
00:36:32,767 --> 00:36:36,282
We evac'ed all the guards
and support personnel. It's their ship.

490
00:36:36,367 --> 00:36:40,280
- They're a threat to the entire fleet.
- They've been disarmed.

491
00:36:40,887 --> 00:36:44,402
- The ship itself has no weapons.
- The ship itself is a weapon!

492
00:36:45,207 --> 00:36:47,721
They're totally dependent on us
for food, fuel...

493
00:36:47,807 --> 00:36:51,482
and they've agreed to organise the
workforce for the water detail on the moon.

494
00:36:51,567 --> 00:36:54,127
You've committed me
to holding elections within a year.

495
00:36:54,207 --> 00:36:56,721
Madam President, with respect...

496
00:36:57,207 --> 00:37:00,358
you're serving out the remainder
of President Adar's term.

497
00:37:00,967 --> 00:37:04,801
When that term is up in seven months,
the law says there's an election.

498
00:37:05,287 --> 00:37:07,323
I only committed you to obeying the law.

499
00:37:07,407 --> 00:37:10,638
- You were not authorised to make any deal.
- You sound like a lawyer.

500
00:37:10,727 --> 00:37:12,718
I swore an oath to defend the articles.

501
00:37:12,807 --> 00:37:16,277
The articles say there's an election
in seven months. If you're saying...

502
00:37:16,407 --> 00:37:19,558
the law's out, then I'm not a captain,
you're not a commander...

503
00:37:19,647 --> 00:37:21,399
and you are not the president.

504
00:37:21,487 --> 00:37:25,446
And I don't owe either of you
a damned explanation for anything.

505
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:30,960
He's your son.

506
00:37:32,287 --> 00:37:33,959
He's your advisor.

507
00:37:35,007 --> 00:37:36,406
An election.

508
00:37:40,767 --> 00:37:43,440
I guess you finally picked your side.

509
00:37:45,167 --> 00:37:46,805
Madam President.

510
00:38:15,287 --> 00:38:17,164
What the hell is this? Water?

511
00:38:17,247 --> 00:38:20,603
Bet your ass.
There's plenty more where that came from.

512
00:38:24,727 --> 00:38:26,558
I have my flaws, too.

513
00:38:27,807 --> 00:38:30,844
The difference is, my flaws are personal,
yours are professional.

514
00:38:35,487 --> 00:38:38,081
Thank you, Lieutenant. That'll be all.

515
00:38:49,687 --> 00:38:52,724
Specialist Lazy, how are you feeling?
Must be nice...

516
00:38:52,807 --> 00:38:54,957
lying around, doing nothing, as usual.

517
00:38:55,047 --> 00:38:57,481
Sorry, Chief.
I didn't think you'd find me here.

518
00:38:58,287 --> 00:39:01,404
I am so on to you.
Cally, is it true?

519
00:39:01,687 --> 00:39:05,839
You really bite that guy's ear off?
He's lucky that's all I bit off.

520
00:39:08,207 --> 00:39:09,765
That's my girl.

521
00:39:18,687 --> 00:39:22,521
- I'm sorry, I can come back.
- No, it's all right. Come on in.

522
00:39:25,287 --> 00:39:28,802
<i>I just wanted to say goodbye
before I head back to Galactica.</i>

523
00:39:28,887 --> 00:39:30,639
And to tell you...

524
00:39:30,927 --> 00:39:34,363
I hope you understand,
I wasn't being disloyal, Madam President.

525
00:39:34,487 --> 00:39:38,082
I understand.
You're upholding the law. I admire it.

526
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:41,766
I believe in you. In what you're doing.

527
00:39:42,447 --> 00:39:46,599
And for what it's worth,
seven months from now, you'll have my vote.

528
00:39:49,287 --> 00:39:50,800
Could you sit?

529
00:40:01,367 --> 00:40:03,961
There's something I need to tell you.

530
00:40:04,967 --> 00:40:08,039
The truth is,
I might not be here in seven months.

531
00:40:08,127 --> 00:40:10,595
- Are you planning a vacation?
- I wish.

532
00:40:14,727 --> 00:40:16,843
I told your father that I...

533
00:40:18,047 --> 00:40:20,436
had allergies, but I have cancer.

534
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,766
I found out
the morning of the attack.

535
00:40:27,247 --> 00:40:32,037
I'm so sorry, Madam President.
I don't know what to say.

536
00:40:32,207 --> 00:40:33,640
I understand.

537
00:40:34,047 --> 00:40:37,357
I'm going to fight this,
but there is a great need for secrecy.

538
00:40:37,447 --> 00:40:38,846
Of course.

539
00:40:41,007 --> 00:40:43,396
Whether or not I survive this illness...

540
00:40:43,487 --> 00:40:46,126
it is of great importance to me...

541
00:40:46,247 --> 00:40:47,999
that there's a future for the people.

542
00:40:48,167 --> 00:40:51,842
And I fear that knowledge
of my illness will erode hope.

543
00:40:53,447 --> 00:40:55,722
So this has to stay between you and me.

544
00:40:58,207 --> 00:41:02,120
- You can count on me.
- I know I can.

545
00:41:04,687 --> 00:41:06,518
You're Capt. Apollo.
