1
00:00:02,327 --> 00:00:04,795
<i>Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.</i>

2
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,835
Zak failed basic flight.

3
00:00:37,127 --> 00:00:39,038
And I should have flunked him, but I didn't.

4
00:00:39,127 --> 00:00:41,163
The bottom line is that I killed him.

5
00:00:41,247 --> 00:00:44,125
Walk out of this cabin
while you still can.

6
00:00:44,247 --> 00:00:45,236
I don't get it.

7
00:00:45,327 --> 00:00:48,524
How does a military coded signal
end up coming from in here?

8
00:00:49,887 --> 00:00:50,922
Food.

9
00:00:51,007 --> 00:00:52,042
<i>It's the Cylons.</i>

10
00:00:52,127 --> 00:00:54,357
Starbuck's wireless and transponder
just cut out.

11
00:00:54,447 --> 00:00:56,119
Starbuck's gonna take on all eight.

12
00:00:56,207 --> 00:00:57,196
And get herself killed.

13
00:01:05,127 --> 00:01:08,039
<i>Galactica. Hot Dog's aboard.
Yeah, so is his lunch.</i>

14
00:01:08,127 --> 00:01:11,164
Take it easy, Hot Dog.
You're not the first to lose it in combat.

15
00:01:11,247 --> 00:01:12,282
You won't be the last.

16
00:01:12,367 --> 00:01:13,561
No sign of Starbuck.

17
00:01:13,647 --> 00:01:16,957
He says she was hit but still in the fight
when he lost track of her.

18
00:01:17,047 --> 00:01:20,357
<i>Roger that. Search and rescue ops
are underway for Starbuck.</i>

19
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:23,280
<i>Bring Hot Dog in.
The old man wants to talk to him.</i>

20
00:01:23,367 --> 00:01:24,846
This is where you found him?

21
00:01:24,927 --> 00:01:27,361
Yes, sir,
he drifted quite a ways from the fight.

22
00:01:27,447 --> 00:01:30,883
Was she manoeuvring?
I think so. Yes. Yes, sir.

23
00:01:30,967 --> 00:01:33,686
So she survived the initial hits.
She could still be alive.

24
00:01:33,767 --> 00:01:36,122
She is alive, Lieutenant.
We're gonna find her.

25
00:01:36,207 --> 00:01:37,242
Yes, sir.

26
00:01:37,327 --> 00:01:39,841
Get this man to sick bay.
Yes, sir.

27
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,802
I think you earned those today.

28
00:01:56,247 --> 00:01:59,000
The auxiliary RT switch sticks a little, sir,
but she'll fly.

29
00:01:59,087 --> 00:02:02,443
- Polish up the canopy. I want it crystal clear.
- Yes, sir.

30
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:16,437
- Find her.
- I will.

31
00:04:56,047 --> 00:04:57,844
Still no joy from the search teams.

32
00:04:57,927 --> 00:05:00,122
<i>In the last four hours
we've combed everywhere...</i>

33
00:05:00,207 --> 00:05:02,960
in a 200 click sphere
around Starbuck's last known position.

34
00:05:03,047 --> 00:05:07,279
No ship, no ejection seat, no debris.
So we're extending the radius another 50.

35
00:05:07,367 --> 00:05:11,326
- We need more pilots.
- Everybody who can fly is up, sir.

36
00:05:11,847 --> 00:05:14,281
What about Starbuck's course computations?

37
00:05:14,407 --> 00:05:17,683
The variables of combat manoeuvring
make them almost meaningless.

38
00:05:17,767 --> 00:05:20,679
- It's time to start guessing.
- Yes, sir.

39
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:24,165
Since there's been no dradis contact
in the area...

40
00:05:24,247 --> 00:05:28,525
I would have to guess that her Viper was
captured by the gravity of a planetary body.

41
00:05:28,607 --> 00:05:32,122
The only nearby gravity wells
are the gas giant and this moon.

42
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:35,995
<i>If the gas giant pulled her in,
its radiation would fry her like an egg.</i>

43
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:37,520
What about the moon?

44
00:05:37,607 --> 00:05:41,441
The spectroscope people call the atmosphere
as CO2, methane, some argon.

45
00:05:41,527 --> 00:05:43,245
The clouds are mostly hydrocarbons.

46
00:05:43,327 --> 00:05:46,160
Cold as hell down there,
but she'd survive on the surface.

47
00:05:46,247 --> 00:05:48,442
- Until her oxygen runs out.
- When?

48
00:05:48,527 --> 00:05:50,518
Forty-six hours and change, sir.

49
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,247
Hell of a long time to stay in one place.

50
00:05:56,327 --> 00:05:59,922
- What if the Cylons appear?
- They won't, not for a while.

51
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:02,360
What makes you say that?

52
00:06:02,447 --> 00:06:06,884
Sending a patrol instead of the base ship
tells me they didn't even know we were here.

53
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:11,324
So they're searching a lot of other places,
places with potential supplies.

54
00:06:11,407 --> 00:06:13,796
Like staking out water holes in the desert.

55
00:06:13,887 --> 00:06:17,323
If we sent eight fighters
to search an entire star system...

56
00:06:17,407 --> 00:06:21,844
for 60-odd ships, it would take us weeks...

57
00:06:21,927 --> 00:06:25,556
Assume they're better and faster.
It'll take them days.

58
00:06:26,327 --> 00:06:29,842
- A lot of assumptions you're making.
- Educated guess.

59
00:06:31,007 --> 00:06:35,239
- Talk to me about searching the moon.
- That's going to be slow going.

60
00:06:35,447 --> 00:06:38,200
We can't see squat through those clouds.

61
00:06:38,407 --> 00:06:40,921
Send the ships below the cloud cover.

62
00:06:41,007 --> 00:06:44,636
Tell the pilots to take a hard look
the old-fashioned way.

63
00:06:44,727 --> 00:06:46,604
Mark One Eyeball, sir?

64
00:06:50,287 --> 00:06:51,925
Mark One Eyeball.

65
00:06:54,007 --> 00:06:56,441
<i>Commander, call from Colonial One.</i>

66
00:06:58,567 --> 00:06:59,556
Adama.

67
00:06:59,647 --> 00:07:02,115
Commander Adama, I don't wanna take
much of your time.

68
00:07:02,207 --> 00:07:05,324
I wanted to say how happy we all are
you found one of your pilots.

69
00:07:05,407 --> 00:07:06,920
<i>Thank you, Madam President.</i>

70
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,567
How is the search progressing
for the other pilot?

71
00:07:09,647 --> 00:07:11,365
Nothing yet, but we've just begun.

72
00:07:11,447 --> 00:07:13,836
<i>I've spoken
with the other captains in the fleet.</i>

73
00:07:13,927 --> 00:07:16,646
They've agreed to give over their ships
at your disposal...

74
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,399
if it'll increase the odds of finding her.

75
00:07:18,487 --> 00:07:21,365
<i>Frack the odds.
We're going to find her.</i>

76
00:07:25,287 --> 00:07:28,757
Excuse me. Thank you.

77
00:07:29,807 --> 00:07:32,605
Tell them we could sure use the help.

78
00:07:33,047 --> 00:07:36,881
I'll coordinate their efforts with your CIC.
Continued good luck.

79
00:07:36,967 --> 00:07:38,286
<i>Thank you.</i>

80
00:07:41,807 --> 00:07:43,126
Thank you.

81
00:07:48,087 --> 00:07:51,841
So it looks like
we're going to be staying here for a while.

82
00:07:56,447 --> 00:07:59,564
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine, it's just a...

83
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:03,403
How long you think it will be
before the Cylons wonder what happened...

84
00:08:03,487 --> 00:08:07,116
to their missing patrol,
and send another one here to look for it?

85
00:08:07,207 --> 00:08:11,758
You have attacked us hundreds of times.
We're still here.

86
00:08:12,887 --> 00:08:16,277
I think you'll find that we are
more than adequately protected.

87
00:08:16,367 --> 00:08:19,882
Might be a little tricky with the fleet
scattered over half this system...

88
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,844
looking for the lost pilot.

89
00:08:21,927 --> 00:08:24,805
How many days till the Cylons return,
Gaius?

90
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:27,676
One?

91
00:08:30,487 --> 00:08:31,556
Two?

92
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,479
Three at the most?

93
00:08:43,087 --> 00:08:44,315
Doctor?

94
00:08:46,007 --> 00:08:47,679
Your requisitions.

95
00:08:49,447 --> 00:08:50,800
Thank you.

96
00:08:58,127 --> 00:09:02,757
Madam President,
I don't mean to be impertinent, really, but...

97
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,635
do you honestly think this is wise?

98
00:09:06,007 --> 00:09:09,124
You are compromising the security
of the entire fleet...

99
00:09:09,207 --> 00:09:11,482
while we search for one solitary pilot.

100
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:16,004
It is a risk, but those pilots put their lives
on the line for us every day.

101
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:19,045
Yes. I was just saying that, to...

102
00:09:21,007 --> 00:09:23,282
I'm not insensitive,
that is what I'm saying.

103
00:09:23,367 --> 00:09:26,086
I happen to know
the missing pilot personally.

104
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:28,522
Not as personally as you'd like.

105
00:09:28,927 --> 00:09:31,395
Guess you'll never find out
if she's a real blonde.

106
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:34,524
It's all the more difficult for me.
On one hand I think of the pilot.

107
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:37,883
And on the other hand
I think of the thousands of defenceless...

108
00:09:37,967 --> 00:09:42,245
women and children.
I meant, throughout the fleet.

109
00:09:42,327 --> 00:09:45,683
I am sure Commander Adama
has considered all of this.

110
00:09:45,767 --> 00:09:48,884
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Yes, of course he has.

111
00:09:50,607 --> 00:09:52,757
Of course he has. Thank you.

112
00:10:21,927 --> 00:10:23,246
It's okay.

113
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:46,685
Okay, get to higher ground.

114
00:10:48,327 --> 00:10:52,115
Then they see you. Then they rescue you.

115
00:11:01,767 --> 00:11:05,476
<i>Apollo, Galactica, we are being bounced
around like beach balls down here.</i>

116
00:11:05,567 --> 00:11:09,321
<i>Visibility about two, best spectrum.
Copy, Apollo.</i>

117
00:11:10,447 --> 00:11:12,756
Blue! Blue flight, go vertical now!

118
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,806
- Anything?
- No.

119
00:11:45,727 --> 00:11:49,322
- I don't think anyone's left out there.
- Must be someone.

120
00:11:49,447 --> 00:11:52,120
We can't be the only two people
left in the world.

121
00:11:52,207 --> 00:11:54,084
Good news is my leg's much better...

122
00:11:54,167 --> 00:11:56,806
and we've got anti-radiation meds
to last three months.

123
00:11:56,887 --> 00:11:58,957
I say we load up
as much food as we can and...

124
00:11:59,047 --> 00:12:00,036
Move out.

125
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:04,518
Try to find a Raptor or a transport
or something we can fly off Caprica.

126
00:12:06,247 --> 00:12:08,807
Unless you can think of a reason to stay.

127
00:12:08,887 --> 00:12:11,765
Not really looking forward
to going back out there.

128
00:12:11,847 --> 00:12:14,077
I've almost started to think
of this place as...

129
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:15,486
home.
Home.

130
00:12:19,887 --> 00:12:21,684
No, sleep a little longer.

131
00:12:21,767 --> 00:12:24,156
Who knows when we'll find
clean sheets again.

132
00:12:24,247 --> 00:12:27,364
I'm going to go topside
and make some breakfast.

133
00:12:29,607 --> 00:12:30,926
Breakfast.

134
00:13:49,327 --> 00:13:51,318
Hey, is breakfast ready?

135
00:13:54,007 --> 00:13:57,682
Get out of here! Go!

136
00:14:14,767 --> 00:14:17,486
Lords, it's Kara Thrace.

137
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:22,645
I'm running a little low on O2
and I could use a lucky break.

138
00:14:25,487 --> 00:14:28,365
You know? Okay, just thought I'd mention it.

139
00:15:32,047 --> 00:15:34,800
Not bad shooting, if I do say so myself.

140
00:15:36,607 --> 00:15:38,404
Lords, I owe you one.

141
00:15:38,807 --> 00:15:42,959
Looks like I found my ride out of here.
If I can fix you up.

142
00:15:49,647 --> 00:15:52,844
<i>Galactica, Apollo. Bingo fuel.</i>

143
00:15:53,407 --> 00:15:55,363
<i>Roger, Apollo. Return to base.</i>

144
00:15:55,447 --> 00:15:58,041
<i>Can't you tank me in orbit?
Negative, Apollo.</i>

145
00:15:58,567 --> 00:16:02,037
<i>The tankers are refilling.
You'll be dry before they can launch.</i>

146
00:16:05,727 --> 00:16:08,002
Are these figures correct?
Yes, sir.

147
00:16:08,087 --> 00:16:11,557
Atmospheric ops mean Viper
and Raptor engines run continuously.

148
00:16:11,647 --> 00:16:14,798
<i>Fuel's going to be a real problem
if we keep it up.</i>

149
00:16:16,207 --> 00:16:20,246
Any report from the civilian ships?
Nothing. They're spread pretty far out.

150
00:16:20,327 --> 00:16:23,637
We'll have a hell of a time trying
to cover them if the Cylons pop in.

151
00:16:23,727 --> 00:16:26,878
We should consider pulling the civvies
into a defensible formation.

152
00:16:26,967 --> 00:16:29,561
No. Keep all the ships on the search.

153
00:16:29,647 --> 00:16:32,923
We've left enough people behind.
I don't wanna leave Starbuck behind.

154
00:16:33,007 --> 00:16:36,238
- Committing the entire fleet to this...
- I said no!

155
00:16:39,487 --> 00:16:43,400
We are going to find our missing pilot
and we're going to bring her home.

156
00:16:44,327 --> 00:16:46,283
We leave no one behind.

157
00:16:49,207 --> 00:16:50,959
Resume your duties.

158
00:17:11,087 --> 00:17:12,281
Sharon?

159
00:17:31,247 --> 00:17:33,078
Sharon, where are you?

160
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,676
Damn it, Sharon, where are you?

161
00:17:53,887 --> 00:17:54,876
Sharon!

162
00:18:20,247 --> 00:18:21,475
Frack me.

163
00:18:23,167 --> 00:18:24,759
<i>Are you alive?</i>

164
00:18:48,807 --> 00:18:50,638
What the hell happened this time, Captain?

165
00:18:50,727 --> 00:18:54,800
I hit the roll thrusters to level off
for set down but only the left one fired.

166
00:18:54,887 --> 00:18:58,277
It's that crap you're flying into down there.
Gums everything up.

167
00:18:58,367 --> 00:18:59,641
Get me another Viper.

168
00:18:59,727 --> 00:19:03,845
<i>Love to, but this is 13 Vipers
that are down, plus your Mark VII. I'm out.</i>

169
00:19:03,927 --> 00:19:06,441
I've got a pilot down
and I need another Viper now.

170
00:19:06,527 --> 00:19:07,801
I realise that, Captain.

171
00:19:07,887 --> 00:19:10,560
But you can push people a lot further
than machines.

172
00:19:10,647 --> 00:19:13,605
I'm the CAG, you're the Chief.
Just make it happen.

173
00:19:16,367 --> 00:19:20,883
Commander, the clock has passed
five hours, sir, for Starbuck's O2 supply.

174
00:19:20,967 --> 00:19:22,002
Noted.

175
00:19:22,087 --> 00:19:24,806
Here's the photo mosaic
for the area we searched so far.

176
00:19:24,887 --> 00:19:26,445
We've got to do better than this.

177
00:19:26,527 --> 00:19:28,483
Can't see far
when you're hugging the ground.

178
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,205
You can't see anything from altitude.

179
00:19:30,287 --> 00:19:33,404
Not to mention the crap in the air
that keeps screwing up our ships.

180
00:19:33,487 --> 00:19:35,318
Thirteen Vipers down for repairs.

181
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:38,160
We need more eyes.
Where we going to get them?

182
00:19:38,247 --> 00:19:39,726
Pull the CAP.
What?

183
00:19:39,807 --> 00:19:42,241
Redeploy the Combat Air Patrol
to the search.

184
00:19:42,327 --> 00:19:44,682
Bad idea. The CAP is the fleet's only defence.

185
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,917
If all Vipers are fracking around
on the moon...

186
00:19:47,007 --> 00:19:49,157
when the Cylons come calling,
we're maggot meat.

187
00:19:49,247 --> 00:19:50,999
Then bring the fleet closer to the moon.

188
00:19:51,087 --> 00:19:54,397
We can always scramble the Vipers
from the search to meet any attack.

189
00:19:54,487 --> 00:19:58,002
Bottom line: we can double the area
we can search in the time we have left.

190
00:19:58,087 --> 00:20:00,760
Starbuck would be the first one to tell you
not to do this.

191
00:20:00,847 --> 00:20:04,522
Nothing would make you happier, would it?
Leave her behind.

192
00:20:04,847 --> 00:20:09,045
Get rid of the foul-mouthed insubordinate
pilot that keeps challenging your authority.

193
00:20:09,127 --> 00:20:13,484
You are way out of line. I'm not the one
confusing personal feelings with duty.

194
00:20:13,567 --> 00:20:14,795
What the hell does that mean?

195
00:20:14,887 --> 00:20:17,401
You are way too close to this
because she's your friend.

196
00:20:17,487 --> 00:20:18,806
Gentlemen!

197
00:20:22,567 --> 00:20:25,604
We have work to do. Captain.

198
00:20:34,887 --> 00:20:38,675
Get as many birds up in the air as you can
and you find our girl.

199
00:20:42,447 --> 00:20:43,800
You got it.

200
00:20:53,167 --> 00:20:55,442
Oh, my gods.

201
00:20:56,807 --> 00:20:59,116
You bite me, I'll bite you back.

202
00:21:02,607 --> 00:21:06,202
So I guess
the only thing flying you is you.

203
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:09,323
This must be your brain.

204
00:21:19,927 --> 00:21:22,122
I don't think you'll need it.

205
00:21:24,727 --> 00:21:27,764
Good thing that I brought one of my own.

206
00:21:46,727 --> 00:21:50,561
Even cockroaches have to breathe.
How the hell do you?

207
00:21:52,367 --> 00:21:54,437
Captain. Call for you, sir.

208
00:21:55,887 --> 00:21:58,321
Can someone finish this up for me?

209
00:21:59,847 --> 00:22:01,803
Where is it?
That way.

210
00:22:03,007 --> 00:22:05,805
<i>Yeah, Apollo.
Hold for President Roslin.</i>

211
00:22:06,807 --> 00:22:08,638
<i>How're you holding up?</i>

212
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:13,120
Better than my Viper. We're slapping
one together from pieces of the others.

213
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:14,526
<i>I need your help.</i>

214
00:22:14,607 --> 00:22:17,838
Did you know that your father
just redeployed the Combat Air Patrol?

215
00:22:17,927 --> 00:22:21,203
- Yes, Madam President. It was my idea.
- Your idea?

216
00:22:21,487 --> 00:22:23,318
We need every Viper we've got.

217
00:22:23,407 --> 00:22:26,365
<i>Maybe I'm missing something
about the tactics involved.</i>

218
00:22:26,447 --> 00:22:29,484
But isn't the fleet defenceless
without the CAP?

219
00:22:29,567 --> 00:22:31,159
<i>Only for a short time.</i>

220
00:22:33,127 --> 00:22:37,166
Because after that, Kara's oxygen
will be gone and she'll be dead.

221
00:22:37,247 --> 00:22:40,159
Are you very close with Lt. Thrace?

222
00:22:41,087 --> 00:22:42,839
I'm close with all my pilots.

223
00:22:42,927 --> 00:22:45,646
And I assume
the same is true for your father?

224
00:22:45,727 --> 00:22:49,163
His pilots mean a lot to him. To all of us.
We don't leave anyone behind.

225
00:22:49,247 --> 00:22:51,807
But we have left people behind.
You know that.

226
00:22:51,887 --> 00:22:53,366
Not this time.

227
00:22:53,967 --> 00:22:56,401
Your FTL drive should be spun up and ready.

228
00:22:56,487 --> 00:23:00,002
Just make sure everyone is set to jump
at the first sign of trouble.

229
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,157
With all due respect, Captain...

230
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:06,081
there are times when it is necessary
for the safety of the fleet to put...

231
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:07,646
Not this time.

232
00:23:10,367 --> 00:23:12,562
We just haven't exhausted all the options...

233
00:23:12,647 --> 00:23:15,639
and the safety of the fleet
has not been compromised.

234
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:20,679
- I hope you find her.
- Thank you.

235
00:23:27,327 --> 00:23:29,682
Blue flight reports bingo fuel, sir.

236
00:23:29,767 --> 00:23:33,203
Have them stay on the search.
Send the tanker to them.

237
00:23:36,647 --> 00:23:38,877
Is there a problem, Mr. Gaeta?

238
00:23:39,527 --> 00:23:43,884
It's just that trying to tank in that turbulence,
sir, will be extremely hairy.

239
00:23:43,967 --> 00:23:47,277
I suggest we wait
until the clock has run down...

240
00:23:47,367 --> 00:23:50,359
<i>and then tank up
on the way back to Galactica.</i>

241
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:53,600
<i>Did someone call them back to Galactica?</i>

242
00:23:54,527 --> 00:23:58,998
- I just assumed...
- The search was over? It was hopeless?

243
00:24:00,407 --> 00:24:02,477
That we should write Starbuck off as dead?

244
00:24:02,567 --> 00:24:05,286
- Is that what you're telling me, Mr. Gaeta?
- No, sir.

245
00:24:05,367 --> 00:24:08,404
Then what are you trying to tell me,
Mr. Gaeta?

246
00:24:14,687 --> 00:24:17,838
- You have your orders.
- Yes, sir.

247
00:24:21,807 --> 00:24:25,163
Time is up. She's out of O2.

248
00:24:25,687 --> 00:24:27,200
The clock is a guess.

249
00:24:27,287 --> 00:24:29,926
We don't know for a fact
that Starbuck is out of air.

250
00:24:30,007 --> 00:24:32,475
Her tank only holds so much oxygen.

251
00:24:32,567 --> 00:24:35,923
She could have a reserve supply
in her survival gear.

252
00:24:36,127 --> 00:24:37,685
A reserve?
Yes.

253
00:24:37,967 --> 00:24:41,277
What, she just happened to pack
an extra bottle today?

254
00:24:41,367 --> 00:24:42,766
It's possible.

255
00:24:42,847 --> 00:24:44,758
We are putting people at risk.

256
00:24:44,847 --> 00:24:47,315
- We have pilots out there...
- We are not quitting.

257
00:24:47,407 --> 00:24:50,524
...pushing themselves, their ships
too hard, all for the sake of...

258
00:24:50,607 --> 00:24:54,316
We are not quitting
and you are relieved, Colonel.

259
00:25:03,887 --> 00:25:06,321
I stand relieved, sir.

260
00:25:43,527 --> 00:25:46,200
Come on, you're part biological, right?

261
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:50,682
Which means you need oxygen, right?

262
00:25:51,207 --> 00:25:54,085
So it's got to be here, somewhere.

263
00:26:26,767 --> 00:26:28,758
Commander, the President.

264
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:34,916
Adama.

265
00:26:35,007 --> 00:26:39,080
Commander Adama, I just wanted to say
how very sorry I am about Lt. Thrace.

266
00:26:39,167 --> 00:26:42,557
Please give my condolences to your son
and to the rest of the crew.

267
00:26:42,647 --> 00:26:45,605
Excuse me, Madam,
but I think you've been misinformed.

268
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,281
- How?
- We don't know if Starbuck's dead.

269
00:26:48,367 --> 00:26:51,916
<i>I was told that her oxygen
had run out a half an hour ago.</i>

270
00:26:52,007 --> 00:26:55,204
That's an estimate.
She may have a reserve supply.

271
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:59,276
We'll continue the search as long as
there's a chance she may be alive.

272
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:02,120
<i>And how long will that be?
Until I say stop.</i>

273
00:27:02,207 --> 00:27:04,675
This is a military decision,
Madam President.

274
00:27:04,767 --> 00:27:06,485
Thank you for your concern.

275
00:27:10,807 --> 00:27:14,038
First on the list, seal you up...

276
00:27:14,687 --> 00:27:16,962
figure out what controls what.

277
00:27:51,007 --> 00:27:52,918
One of us needs a bath.

278
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:59,356
Now you're going to teach me how to fly.

279
00:28:03,727 --> 00:28:06,605
Red Flight reports an area of highlands here.

280
00:28:06,687 --> 00:28:10,805
- Increased visibility out to 15 clicks maybe.
- It's the wrong side of the moon.

281
00:28:10,887 --> 00:28:12,957
Commander...
Almost impossible to...

282
00:28:13,047 --> 00:28:14,924
<i>We have a signal
from Colonial One's shuttle.</i>

283
00:28:15,007 --> 00:28:17,760
They request permission to land.
The President's on board.

284
00:28:17,847 --> 00:28:20,156
Why wasn't I notified
the President was coming onboard?

285
00:28:20,247 --> 00:28:22,681
There was no advance notice, sir.

286
00:28:23,087 --> 00:28:25,521
I didn't know she was coming.
Let's go.

287
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:30,923
Have Col. Tigh meet her
at the airlock.

288
00:28:31,007 --> 00:28:33,567
Bring her to my quarters, please.
Very well.

289
00:28:34,847 --> 00:28:37,805
Every flying machine has four basic controls:

290
00:28:38,367 --> 00:28:41,598
power, pitch, yaw, and roll.

291
00:28:42,447 --> 00:28:44,039
Where are yours?

292
00:28:57,887 --> 00:29:00,640
Safety tip number one: don't touch that.

293
00:29:01,247 --> 00:29:04,159
Are you going to order us
to stop the search?

294
00:29:04,247 --> 00:29:06,363
I came here to talk, not to give orders.

295
00:29:06,447 --> 00:29:08,517
- It may take an order.
- Why?

296
00:29:10,127 --> 00:29:12,800
Col. Tigh, do I need to know something?

297
00:29:13,607 --> 00:29:17,646
It's gone beyond military needs.
It's personal for the Commander and Lee.

298
00:29:17,727 --> 00:29:19,479
Because of Lt. Thrace?

299
00:29:19,567 --> 00:29:22,718
Because of her, and because of Zak Adama.

300
00:29:23,167 --> 00:29:24,998
The Commander's dead son.

301
00:29:25,087 --> 00:29:28,079
It's complicated.
Take about three weeks to explain.

302
00:29:28,167 --> 00:29:30,283
We've got about three minutes. Talk fast.

303
00:29:35,847 --> 00:29:37,644
She's going to press.

304
00:29:39,367 --> 00:29:40,800
I'm with you.

305
00:29:41,607 --> 00:29:43,279
President Roslin.

306
00:29:44,567 --> 00:29:45,716
Madam President.

307
00:29:45,807 --> 00:29:48,082
Skip the formalities.
You both know why I'm here.

308
00:29:48,167 --> 00:29:51,284
Termination of a pilot's rescue mission
is a military decision.

309
00:29:51,367 --> 00:29:55,042
That's a bunch of crap.
This isn't military, it's personal.

310
00:29:55,287 --> 00:29:59,485
<i>Neither of you can let go of Kara Thrace
because she's your last link to Zak.</i>

311
00:29:59,567 --> 00:30:03,355
- You don't know anything about my brother.
- Don't even begin, Captain.

312
00:30:03,727 --> 00:30:05,683
You've lost perspective. As have you.

313
00:30:05,767 --> 00:30:08,201
Under normal circumstances
it would just be sad...

314
00:30:08,287 --> 00:30:10,562
that you two can't come to terms
with Zak's death.

315
00:30:10,647 --> 00:30:13,002
<i>In this situation
you're putting your pilots at risk.</i>

316
00:30:13,127 --> 00:30:16,961
You're exposing the fleet to possible attack
every moment we stay here.

317
00:30:17,047 --> 00:30:20,039
We've been at risk of an attack since day one.

318
00:30:20,287 --> 00:30:24,405
The Cylons won't be missing
their patrol for at least one more day.

319
00:30:27,607 --> 00:30:31,202
Col. Tigh, how much aviation fuel
has been expended in this operation?

320
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:32,959
Forty-three percent of reserves.

321
00:30:34,367 --> 00:30:36,756
Almost half. That's unacceptable.

322
00:30:37,527 --> 00:30:41,918
Operations in the moon's atmosphere have
put one third of your fighters out of action.

323
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:45,044
That is also completely unacceptable.

324
00:30:45,527 --> 00:30:49,281
Crap. Unacceptable.
Whatever it is you feel about this...

325
00:30:49,607 --> 00:30:52,724
the recovery of one pilot is a military matter.

326
00:30:54,647 --> 00:30:58,765
All right. It's military. Fine.

327
00:31:00,687 --> 00:31:04,475
And you're both officers.
And you're both honourable men.

328
00:31:04,567 --> 00:31:07,479
You're both perfectly aware
that you are putting the lives...

329
00:31:07,567 --> 00:31:11,685
of over 45,000 people
and the future of this civilisation at risk...

330
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,357
for your personal feelings.

331
00:31:15,447 --> 00:31:19,122
<i>Now if the two of you, of all people,
can live with that...</i>

332
00:31:20,407 --> 00:31:23,240
then the human race doesn't stand a chance.

333
00:31:24,247 --> 00:31:25,885
Clear your heads.

334
00:31:47,047 --> 00:31:49,163
Combat. Stand-by.

335
00:31:56,007 --> 00:31:57,599
This is the Commander.

336
00:31:57,687 --> 00:32:00,997
Terminate search operations.
Bring everyone home.

337
00:32:02,047 --> 00:32:06,165
Prepare the fleet to make a jump
to the next system. We're leaving.

338
00:32:12,807 --> 00:32:15,480
Okay, so it either works or it doesn't.

339
00:32:49,287 --> 00:32:53,439
Okay, it's power, roll, pitch, and yaw.

340
00:32:54,127 --> 00:32:57,164
We have control. Take me home.

341
00:33:11,647 --> 00:33:14,957
You stink,
but you're one hell of a flying machine.

342
00:33:19,087 --> 00:33:21,840
I want you to know, I think she's wrong.

343
00:33:22,447 --> 00:33:25,200
I think we have come to terms
with what happened to Zak.

344
00:33:25,287 --> 00:33:26,606
I haven't.

345
00:33:31,407 --> 00:33:33,398
I need to know something.

346
00:33:42,647 --> 00:33:46,356
Why did you do this? Why did we do this?

347
00:33:47,487 --> 00:33:51,321
Is it for Kara? For Zak? For what?

348
00:33:52,207 --> 00:33:53,845
Kara was family.

349
00:33:54,207 --> 00:33:58,041
You do whatever you have to do.
Sometimes you break the rules.

350
00:34:00,727 --> 00:34:04,800
- And if it was me down there instead?
- You don't have to ask that.

351
00:34:05,287 --> 00:34:06,766
Are you sure?

352
00:34:08,207 --> 00:34:09,845
If it were you...

353
00:34:11,447 --> 00:34:13,119
we'd never leave.

354
00:34:24,167 --> 00:34:25,964
Colonel.
Commander.

355
00:34:27,687 --> 00:34:31,600
- Resume your duties.
- Sir, fighters are aboard, sir.

356
00:34:31,687 --> 00:34:34,565
Civilian ships have begun their jumps
to the next star system.

357
00:34:34,647 --> 00:34:37,605
Give the word, we'll start our clock.
Start the clock.

358
00:34:37,687 --> 00:34:39,962
Mr. Gaeta, start the clock.
Starting clock.

359
00:34:40,047 --> 00:34:42,607
Madam President,
would you like to return to your ship?

360
00:34:42,687 --> 00:34:46,043
Thank you, I'll stay here.
I'd like to see how the professionals do it.

361
00:34:46,127 --> 00:34:47,526
As you wish.

362
00:34:58,727 --> 00:35:03,005
- Execute jump, Lt. Gaeta.
- Aye, sir. Jump clock is running.

363
00:35:03,127 --> 00:35:04,446
Navigation?
Go.

364
00:35:04,527 --> 00:35:05,880
FTL?
Go.

365
00:35:06,447 --> 00:35:07,880
Tactical?
Go.

366
00:35:07,967 --> 00:35:08,956
Flight Ops?

367
00:35:09,047 --> 00:35:11,322
Contact. Dradis contact.

368
00:35:11,407 --> 00:35:15,241
Incoming, bearing 060, carom 308.

369
00:35:16,007 --> 00:35:17,918
- Hold count.
- Count held.

370
00:35:18,087 --> 00:35:20,362
Contact is...
Hold the count.

371
00:35:22,247 --> 00:35:23,362
Well?

372
00:35:24,767 --> 00:35:29,238
- Cylon Raider, sir.
- You're right. It's just a matter of time.

373
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:32,842
He's on an intercept course. He'll be on us
before we complete the jump.

374
00:35:32,927 --> 00:35:35,202
Action stations, launch Vipers.

375
00:35:35,927 --> 00:35:39,966
<i>Action stations. Launch
alert, Vipers. Cylon Raider approaching.</i>

376
00:35:50,647 --> 00:35:53,115
Now look
before you shoot, please.

377
00:35:55,207 --> 00:35:58,005
Gun captains report
weapons manned and ready.

378
00:35:58,087 --> 00:36:01,204
Where the hell are the Vipers?
Most are being fuelled.

379
00:36:01,287 --> 00:36:03,403
Hot Dog and Apollo
are in the tubes.

380
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:10,239
<i>Viper I, clear forward.</i>

381
00:36:10,327 --> 00:36:13,876
<i>Navcon Green, interval failure. Abort launch.</i>

382
00:36:13,967 --> 00:36:15,082
Frack!

383
00:36:18,527 --> 00:36:20,404
I guess I'm going solo.

384
00:36:20,927 --> 00:36:23,122
Why only one Cylon this time?

385
00:36:24,527 --> 00:36:26,916
It could be a lone recon mission...

386
00:36:27,047 --> 00:36:30,596
or the vanguard for a Cylon base ship
about to jump on top of us.

387
00:36:30,687 --> 00:36:34,077
Either way, we're going to have
to take it out before we can jump.

388
00:36:34,607 --> 00:36:37,075
<i>Galactica, Apollo. Target in sight.</i>

389
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:49,802
You idiot. Didn't anybody teach you
intercept protocol?

390
00:36:50,367 --> 00:36:53,837
Okay, we're going to have
to do this the hard way then.

391
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:03,684
This bastard's good.

392
00:37:04,007 --> 00:37:06,601
They're closing fast.
Port guns have a firing solution.

393
00:37:06,687 --> 00:37:07,756
Very well.

394
00:37:12,327 --> 00:37:15,683
- Hold still, you little...
- No cigar for you.

395
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:19,796
Just come a little bit closer.

396
00:37:22,767 --> 00:37:24,325
Not that close!

397
00:37:26,807 --> 00:37:28,206
What the...

398
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,760
<i>I've lost him.</i>

399
00:37:30,927 --> 00:37:33,600
<i>Galactica, I repeat, he is nowhere to be seen.</i>

400
00:37:33,687 --> 00:37:36,759
- Dradis.
- No help. Their reports have merged.

401
00:37:36,847 --> 00:37:39,281
Launch tube status?
Still fouled.

402
00:37:39,447 --> 00:37:43,326
- We'll have a Viper away in 45 seconds.
- This will be over in 45 seconds.

403
00:37:52,767 --> 00:37:53,995
Holy...

404
00:37:54,367 --> 00:37:57,996
<i>Galactica, the Cylon is now flying
in formation with me...</i>

405
00:37:58,287 --> 00:38:00,005
<i>right above my head.</i>

406
00:38:00,527 --> 00:38:03,485
<i>This thing is acting weird.
Put me through.</i>

407
00:38:14,967 --> 00:38:17,640
<i>It's Starbuck!
What?</i>

408
00:38:19,327 --> 00:38:21,045
Come again, Apollo.

409
00:38:21,807 --> 00:38:25,595
<i>Galactica, the Cylon Raider
is marked "Starbuck. "</i>

410
00:38:25,687 --> 00:38:28,247
<i>It's written under the fracking wing.</i>

411
00:38:46,047 --> 00:38:48,083
Bring it into the bay.

412
00:38:48,167 --> 00:38:51,284
If it does anything, take it out.

413
00:38:51,447 --> 00:38:54,723
<i>Wilco, Galactica,
but I tell you what, it's got to be her.</i>

414
00:38:54,927 --> 00:38:57,646
<i>This thing is flying
with some serious attitude.</i>

415
00:39:11,727 --> 00:39:13,797
Now your ass belongs to me.

416
00:39:18,247 --> 00:39:19,885
Like my new toy?

417
00:39:20,087 --> 00:39:23,762
Boy, when you take a souvenir,
you don't screw around.

418
00:39:24,447 --> 00:39:28,918
- Oh, my God, you smell like a latrine.
- You want to give me a bath?

419
00:39:40,767 --> 00:39:44,203
- How're you feeling?
- Been a hell of a lot worse.

420
00:39:46,447 --> 00:39:49,280
Don't have any ambrosia, but the Doc...

421
00:39:49,367 --> 00:39:52,245
can fix you up with some really nice stuff.

422
00:39:54,487 --> 00:39:56,955
It's not bad, is it? The knee?

423
00:39:57,927 --> 00:40:01,966
Doc says it's too early to tell,
but knowing you, you'll be fine.

424
00:40:03,967 --> 00:40:06,640
- Kara.
- Yeah?

425
00:40:11,007 --> 00:40:12,440
You did good.

426
00:40:18,607 --> 00:40:20,279
Get better, okay?

427
00:40:28,687 --> 00:40:31,645
- Need anything?
- A stogie would be nice.

428
00:40:32,607 --> 00:40:34,199
I had a feeling.

429
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:44,401
- It's my last one, so enjoy it.
- Thank you.

430
00:40:45,567 --> 00:40:47,080
Get some rest.
