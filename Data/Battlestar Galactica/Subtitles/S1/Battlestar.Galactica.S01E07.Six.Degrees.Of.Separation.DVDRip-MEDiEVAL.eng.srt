Battlestar Galactica:</i>

2
00:00:35,127 --> 00:00:36,480
Ignoring me won't help.

3
00:00:36,567 --> 00:00:39,718
No, I've decided you're
an expression of my subconscious mind...

4
00:00:39,807 --> 00:00:41,877
playing itself out in my waking states.

5
00:00:42,767 --> 00:00:45,042
So, I'm in your head?

6
00:00:45,127 --> 00:00:48,324
Of course if you're not really here,
neither am I.

7
00:00:48,407 --> 00:00:51,956
Do you have any idea
what they would do to me if they find out?

8
00:00:52,047 --> 00:00:53,924
They'd probably charge you with treason.

9
00:00:54,007 --> 00:00:56,282
Treason is punishable by the death penalty.

10
00:00:57,207 --> 00:01:00,040
Come on, Sharon. Where are you?

11
00:01:04,127 --> 00:01:05,242
Helo!

12
00:01:05,567 --> 00:01:07,478
We gotta go. Right now.

13
00:01:19,567 --> 00:01:22,286
I don't see the hand of God in here.

14
00:01:24,007 --> 00:01:25,884
<i>Could I be looking in the wrong place?</i>

15
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:32,285
Let me see. Proteins? Yes.
Haemoglobin? Yes.

16
00:01:32,567 --> 00:01:36,845
Divine digits? No.

17
00:01:37,447 --> 00:01:40,484
Sorry. I'm sure I can find evidence...

18
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:43,843
of his divine hand
in one of these delightful samples.

19
00:01:44,967 --> 00:01:48,084
After all, there are so fracking many...

20
00:01:48,167 --> 00:01:51,398
I'm sure even I can be relied upon
to find God in one of them.

21
00:01:51,487 --> 00:01:54,160
What is it
that drives you to blasphemy, Gaius?

22
00:01:54,567 --> 00:01:57,445
A need to tempt fate?
Boredom, actually.

23
00:01:57,967 --> 00:02:00,117
Indeed, every waking hour
is spent...

24
00:02:00,207 --> 00:02:03,358
in what some might say, has become
my own personal religion.

25
00:02:03,447 --> 00:02:06,200
The Church of the Mystic Cylon Detector.

26
00:02:11,847 --> 00:02:13,280
Are you finished?

27
00:02:16,127 --> 00:02:18,721
If you would give yourself over
to God's will...

28
00:02:18,807 --> 00:02:21,321
you'd find peace in his love as I have.

29
00:02:22,727 --> 00:02:25,799
Could you help me with this zipper?
I'm having trouble.

30
00:02:26,527 --> 00:02:29,758
He has a plan for us.
How do you know it's a he?

31
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:34,000
There is only one, true God.

32
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:36,516
Really?

33
00:02:37,047 --> 00:02:40,244
You running a glitch
in the programme or something?

34
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,887
'Cause you say the same thing
over and over again.

35
00:02:42,967 --> 00:02:47,802
Now, I've accepted your God and all that.
Can't we reboot the hard drive?

36
00:02:48,767 --> 00:02:50,758
He's not my God. He is God.

37
00:02:52,367 --> 00:02:54,676
Yeah, your God, my God, everyone's God.

38
00:02:54,927 --> 00:02:58,317
He's big enough for all of us, isn't he?
Now, please.

39
00:02:58,407 --> 00:03:00,079
Please, honey.

40
00:03:00,567 --> 00:03:04,526
Can't we do something
a little more elevating?

41
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:08,276
It's important you form
a personal relationship with God.

42
00:03:08,727 --> 00:03:11,764
Only you can give yourself over
to his eternal love.

43
00:03:12,447 --> 00:03:14,119
For God's sake!

44
00:03:15,767 --> 00:03:19,680
I can't take this anymore!
I'm trying to save your immortal soul.

45
00:03:19,767 --> 00:03:24,204
What you are doing, darling, is boring me
to death with your superstitious drivel.

46
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,517
Your metaphysical nonsense...

47
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:29,838
which, to be fair, actually appeals
to the half-educated dullards...

48
00:03:29,927 --> 00:03:32,999
that make up most of human society,
but which, I hasten to add...

49
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:37,444
no rational, intelligent,
free-thinking human being truly believes.

50
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,919
<i>Which leads me
to the inescapable conclusion...</i>

51
00:03:42,007 --> 00:03:44,202
that Cylons are, in the final...

52
00:03:48,287 --> 00:03:52,565
That Cylons are, in the final analysis,
little more than toasters...

53
00:03:55,967 --> 00:03:57,844
with great looking legs.

54
00:03:59,567 --> 00:04:01,637
It's my fantasy. See if I care.

55
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:07,917
I'll dream up someone new...

56
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:12,480
a brunette maybe.

57
00:04:17,527 --> 00:04:20,678
Maybe we can dispense with the foreplay.
Get right down to...

58
00:04:20,767 --> 00:04:22,120
What did you say?

59
00:04:24,087 --> 00:04:28,524
That was nothing.
I was just talking to myself.

60
00:04:29,767 --> 00:04:31,086
I talk to myself.

61
00:04:32,807 --> 00:04:33,956
Hang me.

62
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,280
The Commander would like to see you
in the CIC, Doctor.

63
00:04:43,887 --> 00:04:46,447
There you are. Very nice.

64
00:04:47,607 --> 00:04:50,075
- That blouse could open up a button.
- Excuse me?

65
00:04:50,167 --> 00:04:51,759
You wanted to see me, Commander?

66
00:04:51,847 --> 00:04:55,886
Miss Godfrey has brought some
very disturbing accusations to my attention.

67
00:04:56,407 --> 00:04:59,763
I think you should have the chance
to answer them in person.

68
00:05:01,327 --> 00:05:02,806
Right. Thank you.

69
00:05:04,767 --> 00:05:07,520
- And she is?
- She's standing right there.

70
00:05:08,807 --> 00:05:11,321
- I'm right here.
- Yeah, of course you are.

71
00:05:12,447 --> 00:05:14,915
- And?
- Doctor, this is Miss Godfrey.

72
00:05:21,047 --> 00:05:24,323
All of you can see her? You can all see her!

73
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,557
She's standing right next to you.

74
00:05:29,687 --> 00:05:31,882
- Something wrong?
- No.

75
00:05:34,487 --> 00:05:37,957
Don't make me angry, Gaius.
I'd say you have a serious problem.

76
00:05:38,407 --> 00:05:39,556
Get down.

77
00:05:42,327 --> 00:05:45,000
Yes, maybe I...

78
00:05:47,207 --> 00:05:49,641
You'll have to forgive me, Miss Godfrey.

79
00:05:49,727 --> 00:05:53,606
I'm very pleased, if slightly puzzled,
to make your acquaintance.

80
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,723
Don't touch me, you traitor.

81
00:05:57,767 --> 00:06:00,235
Is she talking to me? You talking to me?

82
00:06:00,647 --> 00:06:03,878
You're the one who let the Cylons
into the defence mainframe.

83
00:06:03,967 --> 00:06:06,037
<i>You betrayed your entire race.</i>

84
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,238
You're the man responsible
for the Holocaust...

85
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:09,840
and I'm here to see that you're exposed...

86
00:06:09,927 --> 00:06:13,078
and sentenced to death
as the traitor you really are.

87
00:07:27,407 --> 00:07:31,878
Doctor, Miss Godfrey has made
some startling accusations.

88
00:07:35,647 --> 00:07:37,797
I've never seen this woman before in my life.

89
00:07:38,127 --> 00:07:39,685
Not surprised you don't remember me.

90
00:07:39,767 --> 00:07:42,645
I was just a lowly systems analyst
at the defence ministry.

91
00:07:43,127 --> 00:07:45,083
<i>Doctor Amarak was my associate.</i>

92
00:07:45,687 --> 00:07:50,522
She says you sold out the human race.
You let the Cylons into our defence plans.

93
00:07:53,207 --> 00:07:55,277
Doctor Amarak told me
he had evidence...

94
00:07:55,367 --> 00:07:57,756
that Doctor Baltar was involved
in the sneak attack.

95
00:07:57,847 --> 00:08:01,123
He was trying to reach the President
and inform her when he was killed.

96
00:08:01,207 --> 00:08:03,038
- He told you that, did he?
- Yes.

97
00:08:03,127 --> 00:08:04,401
It's a pity he's no longer with us.

98
00:08:04,487 --> 00:08:07,365
How convenient
that we only have your word for that.

99
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:10,520
- There's also this.
- Yeah, what the frack's that?

100
00:08:13,487 --> 00:08:17,321
He gave me this for safekeeping.
It's ID coded.

101
00:08:18,647 --> 00:08:20,524
Colonial Defence Ministry.

102
00:08:25,127 --> 00:08:27,436
Dr. Amarak gave the disk to me
before he died.

103
00:08:27,527 --> 00:08:32,237
What, as opposed to after he died?
He gave me the disk for safekeeping.

104
00:08:33,327 --> 00:08:34,601
<i>On the disk is a photo.</i>

105
00:08:34,687 --> 00:08:38,282
<i>It was captured from the security camera
in the defence mainframe on Caprica.</i>

106
00:08:38,367 --> 00:08:40,437
It shows the doctor
entering the mainframe...

107
00:08:40,527 --> 00:08:42,916
without permission
the day before the attack.

108
00:08:48,207 --> 00:08:50,038
Nothing criminal about that.

109
00:08:50,327 --> 00:08:53,922
As you can see, the man in the photo
is carrying an explosive device.

110
00:08:54,247 --> 00:08:55,521
Sorry, what?

111
00:08:58,887 --> 00:09:00,366
I definitely never did that.

112
00:09:00,447 --> 00:09:03,245
Just before the Cylon attack,
the entire defence mainframe...

113
00:09:03,327 --> 00:09:05,045
was destroyed by this device.

114
00:09:05,887 --> 00:09:09,402
Honestly, that is not me.
I wasn't there. It's somebody else.

115
00:09:10,367 --> 00:09:13,518
Look, it's not me.
I'm not the man in the photograph.

116
00:09:13,607 --> 00:09:17,964
I see a man. Same height,
same build, but that's a long way from proof.

117
00:09:18,047 --> 00:09:21,437
Thank you, Commander. Now,
if we're quite done with this charade, I'm...

118
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:23,563
I agree, Commander, but look here.

119
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:28,040
In the faceplate of the computer terminal,
there's a reflection of the man's face.

120
00:09:31,047 --> 00:09:34,357
You can't tell anything from that.
Thank you, Colonel.

121
00:09:34,447 --> 00:09:37,644
With the right equipment,
the image could be enlarged and sharpened.

122
00:09:37,727 --> 00:09:39,365
We could see his face.

123
00:09:40,407 --> 00:09:43,638
Enlarging the image is no problem,
but sharpening it...

124
00:09:43,727 --> 00:09:46,366
- Take forever.
- It'd take at least a day, sir.

125
00:09:46,967 --> 00:09:49,720
Mr. Gaeta, let me know
as soon as you have an image.

126
00:09:49,807 --> 00:09:50,842
Sir.

127
00:09:50,927 --> 00:09:53,964
You're going to suspend all work
on the Cylon detector...

128
00:09:54,047 --> 00:09:57,323
- What?
... as well as your security privileges.

129
00:10:01,207 --> 00:10:03,880
<i>Starbuck's notes on the Cylon Raider
are a mess.</i>

130
00:10:04,607 --> 00:10:08,441
She said "the engine power-up
sequence began by squeezing something...

131
00:10:08,527 --> 00:10:12,964
"that looks like a red ligament
with blue veins on the right side...

132
00:10:13,047 --> 00:10:16,835
"coming out of a sack of gooey fluid...

133
00:10:17,047 --> 00:10:20,323
- "shaped like a dog. "
- Are you kidding me?

134
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:26,036
This whole thing is a bunch of veins
and ligaments and sacks of goo.

135
00:10:26,567 --> 00:10:28,285
"Squeeze the ligament
with your hand...

136
00:10:28,367 --> 00:10:30,085
"while you slide your weight...

137
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:34,319
"on your left hip into the lymphatic sack. "

138
00:10:34,407 --> 00:10:35,965
That's just stupid.

139
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:39,678
Afternoon, sir.
Specialist.

140
00:10:40,287 --> 00:10:41,959
- Chief's inside?
- Yeah.

141
00:10:43,567 --> 00:10:46,559
Chief.
God! Yes, sir?

142
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:51,120
How's it coming in there?
I'm getting there, sir.

143
00:10:51,727 --> 00:10:55,083
I haven't quite figured out all the tricks,
but I'm getting there.

144
00:10:58,887 --> 00:11:00,957
Come on, Starbuck, you can do it.

145
00:11:03,127 --> 00:11:04,606
That smarts.

146
00:11:06,847 --> 00:11:11,125
That smarts, but I don't care.

147
00:11:11,207 --> 00:11:12,276
You don't care.

148
00:11:12,367 --> 00:11:14,961
I don't care,
because your pain is my entertainment.

149
00:11:15,047 --> 00:11:18,164
Your crutches of death, sir.
Use them wisely.

150
00:11:18,247 --> 00:11:19,362
Shut up.

151
00:11:19,447 --> 00:11:21,961
It's gonna hurt like hell,
but it's supposed to.

152
00:11:22,047 --> 00:11:23,400
Thanks, Doc.

153
00:11:24,087 --> 00:11:25,486
No pain, no gain.

154
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:32,402
No cliché left unturned as Kara Thrace
returns to the world of the walking.

155
00:11:32,487 --> 00:11:35,126
Can she do it or will she fall on her ass?

156
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:38,320
I swear to the Gods, I'm gonna beat the crap
out of both of you...

157
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:39,920
as soon as I get better.

158
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:43,521
No, I can't.
Yes, you can. You did it.

159
00:11:43,607 --> 00:11:45,199
I can't.

160
00:11:46,527 --> 00:11:48,802
You're not gonna get better
lying on your back.

161
00:11:48,887 --> 00:11:50,206
Frack off!

162
00:11:50,287 --> 00:11:52,517
Just take a break for five minutes,
we'll try again.

163
00:11:52,607 --> 00:11:55,440
I don't want to do it again.
I want a pill, now, please.

164
00:11:55,527 --> 00:11:59,122
Sorry, we're weaning you off the magic pills
starting today.

165
00:11:59,207 --> 00:12:01,198
Besides, I need them for myself.

166
00:12:03,287 --> 00:12:04,766
You son of a bitch.

167
00:12:05,487 --> 00:12:09,400
<i>I am finding this whole thing
hard to fathom, Doctor.</i>

168
00:12:09,487 --> 00:12:11,284
Thank you, Madam President.

169
00:12:13,007 --> 00:12:15,567
I can't tell you how much that means to me.

170
00:12:17,247 --> 00:12:19,966
Look, I was wondering,
is there any chance...

171
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:25,440
<i>that while this investigation is going on,
I could come back to the Colonial One...</i>

172
00:12:25,527 --> 00:12:28,041
because I've left some of my things there.

173
00:12:28,487 --> 00:12:29,966
No, I'm sorry, Doctor.

174
00:12:31,647 --> 00:12:34,798
You have been put on a "no fly list. "
Security.

175
00:12:37,327 --> 00:12:40,160
<i>Madam President,
I need to get off Galactica.</i>

176
00:12:40,247 --> 00:12:43,205
I need to get away from
this Shelly Godfrey woman in particular.

177
00:12:43,287 --> 00:12:44,879
She's got it in for me.

178
00:12:46,367 --> 00:12:47,766
Where are you?

179
00:12:53,367 --> 00:12:56,882
Madam President, I have reason to believe...

180
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:07,605
that she may be a Cylon.

181
00:13:13,007 --> 00:13:15,915
Madam President?

182
00:13:16,687 --> 00:13:17,756
<i>Hello?</i>

183
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:21,597
Get Doc Cottle on the wireless,
the President has collapsed.

184
00:13:23,727 --> 00:13:24,716
Hello?

185
00:13:26,887 --> 00:13:28,798
Is she alive?
Yes, the President is alive.

186
00:13:28,887 --> 00:13:31,447
I told you, she's conscious,
she's resting.

187
00:13:32,647 --> 00:13:35,366
She's receiving treatment.
What kind of treatment?

188
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:36,482
Asked and answered.

189
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:39,525
We think it's a stomach flu.
What kind of treatment?

190
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:42,881
How many of these did you take,
young lady?

191
00:13:44,087 --> 00:13:48,080
- One, two?
- Two.

192
00:13:52,007 --> 00:13:55,443
- Three.
- Three times the dosage.

193
00:13:56,047 --> 00:13:58,515
Must work three times as fast then, right?

194
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:03,797
Everybody wants to be their own doctor,
you are lucky you didn't lapse into a coma.

195
00:14:04,047 --> 00:14:06,436
<i>You can't cure cancer by overdose.</i>

196
00:14:09,527 --> 00:14:12,758
Story's all over the fleet. I'm so sorry.
It's okay.

197
00:14:12,847 --> 00:14:13,996
It seemed like an emergency.

198
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:16,760
I didn't think that anyone
might be picking up the transmission.

199
00:14:16,847 --> 00:14:18,838
We're all new at this. It's okay.

200
00:14:19,967 --> 00:14:22,765
The thing to do now is
to get me on my feet...

201
00:14:23,007 --> 00:14:26,283
and in front of the press
before the end of the day.

202
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:29,763
I could give you a shot,
but you wouldn't like the side effects.

203
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,522
Just do it.

204
00:14:37,087 --> 00:14:41,717
The time is going to come when you won't
be able to hide what you're going through.

205
00:14:45,287 --> 00:14:47,118
It's not that kind of a shot.

206
00:14:50,207 --> 00:14:51,606
Thank you.

207
00:14:54,767 --> 00:14:58,203
Baltar's correct
about the convenience of it all.

208
00:14:59,727 --> 00:15:03,800
Amarak just happens to bring you
the key piece of evidence just before he dies.

209
00:15:03,887 --> 00:15:07,766
Something was going on.
He was almost paranoid.

210
00:15:07,847 --> 00:15:11,886
<i>Kept saying that the Olympic Carrier
had been infiltrated by the Cylons.</i>

211
00:15:13,127 --> 00:15:16,358
He wanted me to take some things
off the ship for safekeeping.

212
00:15:16,607 --> 00:15:18,199
Why'd he give it to you?

213
00:15:20,727 --> 00:15:22,206
We were friends.

214
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,841
Friends?

215
00:15:27,807 --> 00:15:31,243
I loved him. I loved him very much.

216
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:43,125
There are times
when I just feel so alone now.

217
00:15:44,687 --> 00:15:47,645
Times when I just want so much
to be held again.

218
00:15:50,447 --> 00:15:54,565
- You understand that, don't you?
- Of course.

219
00:15:56,527 --> 00:16:00,236
There must be times when you feel alone.

220
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:04,965
And the thought of another body
next to yours...

221
00:16:05,687 --> 00:16:07,723
seems like something out of dream.

222
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:26,562
Do not, under any circumstances,
allow Shelly Godfrey to leave this ship.

223
00:16:27,247 --> 00:16:29,363
<i>Put her under surveillance, discreetly.</i>

224
00:16:30,087 --> 00:16:33,284
I want to know everybody she's talked to,
and everywhere she's been.

225
00:16:48,247 --> 00:16:51,045
Come on, Sharon! Get up.

226
00:17:57,007 --> 00:17:58,042
Excuse me.

227
00:18:17,647 --> 00:18:20,844
Lieutenant?
Is that you?

228
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:26,799
Doctor?
Isn't this a coincidence.

229
00:18:30,127 --> 00:18:33,358
So, how are you doing?

230
00:18:34,567 --> 00:18:37,001
I'm...
You're busy. Yes, I know.

231
00:18:37,087 --> 00:18:40,682
I don't mean to distract you.
Please, don't let me interrupt you.

232
00:18:51,087 --> 00:18:53,203
You still there?
Yup.

233
00:18:54,247 --> 00:18:59,002
I know this is an awkward time.
But it occurred to me I haven't told you...

234
00:18:59,087 --> 00:19:02,682
how invaluable your assistance
has been over the past few weeks.

235
00:19:03,887 --> 00:19:07,516
Thank you, Doctor. You have no idea
how much that means to me.

236
00:19:07,607 --> 00:19:09,404
Not at all.

237
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:13,678
So, how's it going over there?

238
00:19:15,887 --> 00:19:18,526
In the lab, that is?
I'm talking about the photograph.

239
00:19:18,607 --> 00:19:21,724
Right. It's coming along.

240
00:19:21,807 --> 00:19:22,842
Great.

241
00:19:22,927 --> 00:19:25,680
Quickly, actually.
A few more hours to go.

242
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:30,079
Has it ever occurred to you
that the photograph...

243
00:19:30,727 --> 00:19:33,002
disk itself could be a fake?

244
00:19:33,767 --> 00:19:35,439
I've already authenticated the disk.

245
00:19:35,527 --> 00:19:38,758
Obviously, you're good.
But there are many ways around security.

246
00:19:38,847 --> 00:19:42,965
If I could join you in the lab for just
two minutes of your time, I could show you.

247
00:19:43,047 --> 00:19:44,844
I really don't think that's possible.

248
00:19:44,927 --> 00:19:49,045
Listen to me, nobody would need to know.
It would just be you and me.

249
00:19:49,127 --> 00:19:50,196
I know.

250
00:19:50,287 --> 00:19:54,246
For God's sake, my life is on the line.
My reputation is at stake.

251
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:58,445
So is mine, Doctor. I really...
Someone's coming.

252
00:20:11,447 --> 00:20:14,439
Wait, Gaeta!
You forgot to wash your hands!

253
00:20:26,687 --> 00:20:29,201
What the hell...
I want answers, now!

254
00:20:29,287 --> 00:20:32,085
I'm not interested
in playing any more of your games!

255
00:20:32,167 --> 00:20:35,318
Have you lost your mind?
That's an interesting question...

256
00:20:35,407 --> 00:20:36,920
one I pose to myself on a regular basis.

257
00:20:37,007 --> 00:20:40,079
Who's really in the photograph?
You are!

258
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:44,716
I didn't plant any bomb, anywhere,
at any time, and you know that.

259
00:20:45,407 --> 00:20:49,286
I don't know anything of this sort.
Now, if you'll excuse me.

260
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:58,402
All right. Let's entertain the notion,
just for a moment...

261
00:20:59,367 --> 00:21:02,120
that you are not the woman
that I see everywhere.

262
00:21:03,527 --> 00:21:05,677
You are not Shelly Godfrey, either.

263
00:21:07,487 --> 00:21:10,957
You're a fake. You're just a copy.

264
00:21:12,767 --> 00:21:14,962
Another Cylon copy.

265
00:21:16,847 --> 00:21:18,997
Get out.

266
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:25,076
Struck a nerve, have I?
Which I find rather impossible to believe!

267
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:28,045
You think this is over? This is not over!

268
00:21:28,127 --> 00:21:31,324
You have not heard the last.
No more "Mr. Nice Gaius"!

269
00:21:37,447 --> 00:21:38,675
Women.

270
00:21:49,807 --> 00:21:52,162
Stupid. Unbelievable.

271
00:21:54,087 --> 00:21:55,315
Bucket!

272
00:21:57,927 --> 00:21:59,280
Not a good time?

273
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:03,720
No, it's fine.

274
00:22:05,767 --> 00:22:07,678
Guess you're having problems?

275
00:22:08,087 --> 00:22:10,555
I can't get this thing to work.

276
00:22:11,887 --> 00:22:16,597
I've been over it and over it, and nothing.

277
00:22:21,487 --> 00:22:25,321
<i>I have no idea how Starbuck
got this thing to move.</i>

278
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:29,442
Much less fly.
It's not really a thing, you know.

279
00:22:32,607 --> 00:22:34,723
It's probably a Cylon itself.

280
00:22:40,167 --> 00:22:43,000
More of an animal maybe,
than the human models.

281
00:22:46,687 --> 00:22:49,759
Maybe they genetically design it
to perform a task.

282
00:22:50,887 --> 00:22:52,320
To be a fighter.

283
00:22:54,887 --> 00:22:58,084
Can't treat it like a thing
and expect it to respond.

284
00:22:58,647 --> 00:23:01,161
You have to treat it like a pet.

285
00:23:05,807 --> 00:23:08,082
But, at least, that's my guess.

286
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:12,682
- Your guess?
- Yeah, that's right. My guess.

287
00:23:13,567 --> 00:23:17,242
Something else you want to say?
No.

288
00:23:28,727 --> 00:23:32,561
Lieutenant. I heard you were supposed to be
up on your feet by now.

289
00:23:32,647 --> 00:23:33,921
You heard wrong.

290
00:23:34,007 --> 00:23:37,124
I figured you wouldn't bounce back so fast.

291
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:40,961
Is there something you wanted,
or did you just drop by to torment me, sir?

292
00:23:41,047 --> 00:23:43,720
The Chief wanted me
to kick your ass out of bed...

293
00:23:43,807 --> 00:23:46,685
<i>so you could help figure out
that Raider of yours.</i>

294
00:23:46,767 --> 00:23:51,045
But, clearly, you still need the rest.
Take your time. No rush.

295
00:23:51,247 --> 00:23:55,479
Do you actually think that reverse
psychology crap is going to work on me?

296
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:57,398
I really don't care what you think.

297
00:23:57,487 --> 00:23:59,955
All I know is that every day
you spend in that bed...

298
00:24:00,047 --> 00:24:04,404
is another day that I have
my opinion of you confirmed. As you were.

299
00:24:08,767 --> 00:24:11,998
And I am convinced, in fact,
that she is a Cylon agent.

300
00:24:13,607 --> 00:24:17,077
In my opinion, she should be locked up
before she can do any more damage.

301
00:24:22,927 --> 00:24:24,360
Where are you?

302
00:24:27,087 --> 00:24:29,078
You're having a little fun?

303
00:24:34,287 --> 00:24:36,164
Do you enjoy messing around with my life?

304
00:24:36,247 --> 00:24:39,045
Do you have any evidence
to support this charge?

305
00:24:40,167 --> 00:24:43,762
Work on the Cylon detector
is nearly complete with a few tweaks.

306
00:24:43,847 --> 00:24:45,599
I'll have a test regime up and running.

307
00:24:45,687 --> 00:24:49,077
All I need is a tissue sample
from this woman for analysis.

308
00:24:49,327 --> 00:24:51,283
I thought we had something.

309
00:24:54,047 --> 00:24:56,800
Something special.

310
00:24:57,367 --> 00:24:59,835
I can't allow you access
to your equipment.

311
00:25:02,247 --> 00:25:03,362
All right.

312
00:25:04,327 --> 00:25:08,115
But under instruction, I can surely tell Gaeta
how to prepare the samples.

313
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:11,882
- It's not difficult.
- Let me be frank with you, Doctor.

314
00:25:13,487 --> 00:25:16,240
If your picture is on that photograph...

315
00:25:16,327 --> 00:25:21,242
every piece of equipment in your laboratory
will be dismantled and quarantined.

316
00:25:21,527 --> 00:25:26,203
<i>And every person that you have met
will be questioned and investigated.</i>

317
00:25:27,847 --> 00:25:30,964
<i>I love you. There, I've said it.</i>

318
00:25:31,967 --> 00:25:34,197
Isn't that what you've been dying to hear?

319
00:25:34,647 --> 00:25:38,003
I am willing to make that commitment
to you right now.

320
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:40,243
The President believes I'm innocent.

321
00:25:40,327 --> 00:25:44,366
The President hopes you're innocent.
And so do I.

322
00:25:45,447 --> 00:25:49,156
Because if you're not,
then you've made fools of both of us.

323
00:25:50,527 --> 00:25:52,677
And I don't like to be made a fool of.

324
00:25:52,767 --> 00:25:55,076
And I don't like to be accused
of participating...

325
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:57,965
in the genocide of the human race
based solely on the word...

326
00:25:58,047 --> 00:26:01,960
of a woman whom I have already indicated
to you may well be a Cylon agent.

327
00:26:03,487 --> 00:26:06,797
I'm willing to do anything. Anything at all.

328
00:26:07,807 --> 00:26:09,320
I need your help.

329
00:26:09,607 --> 00:26:11,916
I did not conspire with the Cylons.

330
00:26:12,207 --> 00:26:13,560
I am an innocent man...

331
00:26:13,647 --> 00:26:17,560
who is being convicted
in the court of public opinion without trial.

332
00:26:27,567 --> 00:26:28,716
Traitor.

333
00:26:53,247 --> 00:26:55,886
<i>Fire.
All units report to damage control stations.</i>

334
00:26:56,847 --> 00:26:59,281
We got a fire!
Let's go. Clear the doors!

335
00:27:18,047 --> 00:27:19,241
Frack!

336
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:24,043
No fires reported anywhere on the ship.

337
00:27:24,127 --> 00:27:25,526
The exact location of the alarm.

338
00:27:25,607 --> 00:27:27,802
D- Wing corridor
where it intersects with C-Wing.

339
00:27:27,887 --> 00:27:29,206
That's the lab.

340
00:27:33,967 --> 00:27:35,480
Erase.

341
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:19,800
Put it down!

342
00:28:21,047 --> 00:28:22,321
<i>Put it down.</i>

343
00:28:29,887 --> 00:28:31,240
All right, move in.

344
00:28:32,167 --> 00:28:34,442
Take him to the Brig.
Yes, Commander.

345
00:28:35,807 --> 00:28:40,085
I would like to speak to my attorney.
Can't I speak to my attorney?

346
00:28:40,167 --> 00:28:43,284
I need some representation,
it's not what it looks like.

347
00:28:43,367 --> 00:28:46,006
<i>She's got it in for me, that Shelly Godfrey!</i>

348
00:28:58,207 --> 00:29:00,596
Shut up. All of you.

349
00:29:02,167 --> 00:29:06,365
Not one single word from any of you, okay?

350
00:29:07,487 --> 00:29:09,205
What seems to be the problem?

351
00:29:09,287 --> 00:29:11,755
Your new boyfriend's a bit of a jerk, sir.

352
00:29:13,247 --> 00:29:14,362
It's a girl.

353
00:29:14,447 --> 00:29:18,281
If you don't mind her goo
on your face, she's all yours, sir.

354
00:29:19,847 --> 00:29:21,883
Okay.
He likes the warm light.

355
00:29:22,967 --> 00:29:25,003
Makes the touch easier, right?

356
00:29:25,887 --> 00:29:28,924
Maybe, okay.

357
00:29:38,887 --> 00:29:40,639
This is stupid.

358
00:29:41,327 --> 00:29:42,726
This is stupid.

359
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:46,877
It's worth a try, sir. It did fly for you once.

360
00:29:46,967 --> 00:29:49,606
Hasn't made so much as a grunt since.

361
00:29:50,687 --> 00:29:54,282
I don't know, take it for a ride.
Ride it.

362
00:29:54,367 --> 00:29:57,484
Treat it like a horse.
Okay, a horse.

363
00:29:59,207 --> 00:30:01,801
Why not a goat? That's good, right?

364
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:05,437
Think of it as a goat. Okay. Whatever.

365
00:30:07,327 --> 00:30:10,080
Come on, boy. Giddyup!

366
00:30:18,847 --> 00:30:21,645
Okay, you're kidding. Chief?

367
00:30:23,847 --> 00:30:25,724
Don't shoot anything.

368
00:30:31,127 --> 00:30:32,446
Doctor.

369
00:30:38,407 --> 00:30:39,840
Madam President.

370
00:30:47,847 --> 00:30:51,806
- I am so sorry.
- Thank you.

371
00:31:01,727 --> 00:31:03,763
You are here to free me, right?

372
00:31:04,927 --> 00:31:07,157
To bring this travesty to a close...

373
00:31:07,247 --> 00:31:10,398
because you know I'm innocent.

374
00:31:10,887 --> 00:31:14,516
Just tell me, so I understand...

375
00:31:15,247 --> 00:31:19,399
because I want to understand
why you did it.

376
00:31:20,487 --> 00:31:23,479
I didn't do it. It wasn't me.

377
00:31:24,807 --> 00:31:27,719
I'm being framed!
Why would she do that?

378
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:30,443
Because she's a Cylon.

379
00:31:31,167 --> 00:31:32,680
She's a Cylon.

380
00:31:34,687 --> 00:31:38,236
- You are going to have to believe me.
- I want to believe you.

381
00:31:39,167 --> 00:31:43,126
I want to believe that I haven't made
such a profound error in judgment...

382
00:31:43,207 --> 00:31:44,686
in trusting you...

383
00:31:45,887 --> 00:31:47,639
and asking your advice.

384
00:31:50,487 --> 00:31:52,557
But here's where we are, Doctor.

385
00:31:53,247 --> 00:31:57,081
<i>If anyone can be a Cylon,
and it's hard to tell us apart...</i>

386
00:31:57,367 --> 00:32:00,006
then we only have one thing left to trust...

387
00:32:00,207 --> 00:32:02,880
our instincts, feelings.

388
00:32:04,487 --> 00:32:07,399
And the moment they told me
it was your face in the photo...

389
00:32:07,487 --> 00:32:09,125
I knew I believed it.

390
00:32:11,447 --> 00:32:14,120
<i>I believe you're involved in the attack.</i>

391
00:32:15,527 --> 00:32:19,805
Somehow, I feel it.

392
00:32:22,007 --> 00:32:24,202
You'll forgive me, Madam President...

393
00:32:26,087 --> 00:32:31,036
if I don't wish to be executed
based solely on your gut feeling.

394
00:32:40,207 --> 00:32:42,880
May the gods have mercy on your soul.

395
00:32:50,607 --> 00:32:51,722
Call it.

396
00:32:54,327 --> 00:32:58,878
Heads.
Heads. You win. You sleep. I watch.

397
00:32:58,967 --> 00:33:01,197
No. You're the one
who needs sleep.

398
00:33:03,847 --> 00:33:07,635
I couldn't sleep if I had to listen to Tyrol
read the flight manual.

399
00:33:07,727 --> 00:33:08,716
Okay.

400
00:33:11,207 --> 00:33:14,677
Truth is if something happened to you...

401
00:33:15,887 --> 00:33:18,242
I wouldn't know how to deal with it.

402
00:33:19,607 --> 00:33:21,245
I feel the same way.

403
00:33:28,647 --> 00:33:30,365
Back on the ship...

404
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:35,636
Look, I knew what was going on.
I mean, between you and the Chief.

405
00:33:35,727 --> 00:33:37,240
I think everybody did.

406
00:33:38,247 --> 00:33:41,398
And I respected it. Your feelings, his.

407
00:33:43,167 --> 00:33:46,716
But I would've given anything to be him.

408
00:33:52,607 --> 00:33:56,646
I'm not trying to put you on the spot here.
I don't want to step on what you two have.

409
00:33:56,727 --> 00:33:59,639
You feel the way you feel
and I have to respect it.

410
00:34:31,047 --> 00:34:33,641
No. It's not true.

411
00:35:08,207 --> 00:35:10,198
I know we haven't spoke before.

412
00:35:12,967 --> 00:35:14,685
But I don't wish to offend.

413
00:35:18,087 --> 00:35:19,406
Please.

414
00:35:24,567 --> 00:35:25,920
Dear God...

415
00:35:31,727 --> 00:35:34,764
I now acknowledge
that you are the one true God.

416
00:35:38,047 --> 00:35:39,765
Deliver me from this evil...

417
00:35:44,527 --> 00:35:47,997
and I will devote the rest
of what is left of my wretched life...

418
00:35:50,967 --> 00:35:52,400
to doing good.

419
00:35:57,687 --> 00:35:59,917
I don't know what to...

420
00:36:01,167 --> 00:36:04,796
To carrying out your divine will
is what I want to do.

421
00:36:10,647 --> 00:36:12,797
To carry out your divine will.

422
00:36:27,487 --> 00:36:31,844
Grant me grace and forgiveness.

423
00:36:42,607 --> 00:36:45,485
I'm here now. I'm here.

424
00:36:48,407 --> 00:36:53,083
All will be well.
It will be as God wants it to be.

425
00:37:04,687 --> 00:37:06,120
Open the door.

426
00:37:08,207 --> 00:37:11,995
Wait. I haven't even had a trial yet.

427
00:37:12,127 --> 00:37:15,039
<i>No! Wait! It's a lie!</i>

428
00:37:15,127 --> 00:37:16,845
- Doctor, it's all right.
- It's a lie!

429
00:37:16,927 --> 00:37:18,997
Photograph was a fake.
What?

430
00:37:22,127 --> 00:37:26,882
It was almost seamless, but your face,
the man, the reflection, it was all a fake.

431
00:37:30,007 --> 00:37:34,046
Of course it was a fake.
I don't wear a shirt like that.

432
00:37:36,647 --> 00:37:41,084
How did you...
I went back, re-ran security checks.

433
00:37:41,167 --> 00:37:45,365
This time I found markers
which pointed to photo manipulation.

434
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:50,044
They weren't apparent
until the photo was fully resolved.

435
00:37:53,247 --> 00:37:55,522
You re-ran the security checks?

436
00:37:59,127 --> 00:38:00,276
Thank you.

437
00:38:03,807 --> 00:38:08,198
I just knew that you could never
have anything to do with that attack.

438
00:38:08,687 --> 00:38:10,678
You're not that kind of man.

439
00:38:16,367 --> 00:38:19,359
It was really nothing.
Once the photos were fully resolved...

440
00:38:19,447 --> 00:38:22,120
it was almost too easy,
like she wanted to be found out.

441
00:38:22,207 --> 00:38:23,959
How did she get off?
Got me.

442
00:38:24,047 --> 00:38:26,003
- There's been no ships.
- I gave you an order.

443
00:38:26,087 --> 00:38:27,315
I had two Marines tailing her.

444
00:38:27,407 --> 00:38:29,762
They say they went around a corner
and she was gone.

445
00:38:29,847 --> 00:38:32,361
Every ship in the fleet has reported in, sir.
No sign of her.

446
00:38:32,447 --> 00:38:35,519
That's unacceptable.
She was here. She was right here.

447
00:38:36,167 --> 00:38:38,761
This woman existed. She didn't just vanish.

448
00:38:38,847 --> 00:38:40,360
Have them check again.

449
00:38:40,447 --> 00:38:43,245
- Every ship?
- Every ship, including this one.

450
00:38:53,567 --> 00:38:55,205
She didn't just vanish.

451
00:38:57,847 --> 00:39:01,396
that he had been a victim
of treachery and deceit.

452
00:39:01,847 --> 00:39:04,839
Clearly, the Cylons wanted
to discredit Doctor Baltar...

453
00:39:04,927 --> 00:39:07,395
because of his work on the Cylon detector.

454
00:39:08,207 --> 00:39:11,597
Doctor Baltar, it gives me great pleasure...

455
00:39:11,687 --> 00:39:13,803
to exonerate you publicly...

456
00:39:14,047 --> 00:39:16,766
and to recognise you,
once again, among us...

457
00:39:17,087 --> 00:39:20,443
as a scientist, a leader, and a friend.

458
00:39:33,127 --> 00:39:34,526
You're a hero.

459
00:39:35,887 --> 00:39:39,163
You're even more popular and powerful
than ever before.

460
00:39:41,767 --> 00:39:46,636
You've had your trial by fire,
so now they truly believe in you.

461
00:39:48,727 --> 00:39:51,480
Hard for anyone to accuse you
of treason again.

462
00:39:56,807 --> 00:39:58,718
Was that the plan all along?

463
00:40:00,647 --> 00:40:04,686
Build me up in the public eye
by first tearing me down?

464
00:40:07,207 --> 00:40:08,401
Right.

465
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:12,885
Who am I to question the plans
of Almighty God?

466
00:40:20,367 --> 00:40:24,440
Just one, small, practical question.

467
00:40:26,087 --> 00:40:28,965
Shelly? Shelly Godfrey?

468
00:40:29,487 --> 00:40:32,559
Was there ever a woman
really called Shelly Godfrey?

469
00:40:33,207 --> 00:40:36,358
Did she ever actually exist?
Was she ever really here?

470
00:40:50,127 --> 00:40:51,560
God's will be done.
