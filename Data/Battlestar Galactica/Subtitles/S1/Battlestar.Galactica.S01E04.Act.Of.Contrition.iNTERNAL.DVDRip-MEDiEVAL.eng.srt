1
00:00:02,247 --> 00:00:04,397
<i>Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.</i>

2
00:00:35,687 --> 00:00:39,839
Zak failed basic flight.
But he didn't because I passed him.

3
00:00:40,487 --> 00:00:42,876
I can't decode it,
but it means there's someone.

4
00:00:42,967 --> 00:00:46,880
Someone in the military
is still alive and kicking here in Caprica.

5
00:00:48,207 --> 00:00:49,640
I have cancer.

6
00:00:49,727 --> 00:00:53,356
And I fear that knowledge
of my illness will erode hope.

7
00:00:53,567 --> 00:00:56,240
So this has to stay between you and me.

8
00:00:57,287 --> 00:01:00,438
- Zak was my brother.
- What was he to me, nothing?

9
00:01:01,207 --> 00:01:04,802
Same old Lee. You haven't changed either.

10
00:01:17,927 --> 00:01:19,155
Helmet!

11
00:01:19,327 --> 00:01:21,682
- You are so unprepared.
- Shut up!

12
00:01:21,927 --> 00:01:24,919
You're the worst CAG in the history
of CAGs actually.

13
00:01:28,367 --> 00:01:30,927
<i>Raptor pilot
Lt. Dwight Flat-top Sanders...</i>

14
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:34,124
<i>entering hangar Deck 12 B.
Deck hands, please report.</i>

15
00:01:34,207 --> 00:01:36,767
<i>Repeat, deck hands,
please report to 12 B.</i>

16
00:01:37,087 --> 00:01:39,726
There he is!
Way to go, Lieutenant!

17
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:53,719
<i>Raptor Pilots flying high!
Raptor Pilots flying high!</i>

18
00:01:54,327 --> 00:01:56,477
- Red paint, incoming!
- Brush?

19
00:01:58,247 --> 00:02:00,715
You're the worst. The absolute worst!

20
00:02:00,807 --> 00:02:01,796
Here.

21
00:02:02,007 --> 00:02:06,159
<i>Raptor Pilots flying by!
Raptor Pilots flying by!</i>

22
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:08,641
What the hell is this?

23
00:02:08,727 --> 00:02:12,481
Flat-top's 1,000th landing and
nobody tells me. Now we look like idiots.

24
00:02:12,567 --> 00:02:14,603
Find a wagon!
Yes, sir!

25
00:02:14,687 --> 00:02:16,245
Somebody get me a wagon!

26
00:02:17,687 --> 00:02:20,281
One, zero, zero.

27
00:02:20,567 --> 00:02:22,159
You're not ready yet?

28
00:02:26,327 --> 00:02:28,966
Someone's going to have to pick that up.

29
00:02:30,207 --> 00:02:32,767
- Stop it!
- Let's go, come on.

30
00:02:34,407 --> 00:02:37,365
This one is perfect. Take this.
Here, give me a hand.

31
00:02:37,447 --> 00:02:39,836
Unload this. Put it wherever.

32
00:02:41,247 --> 00:02:42,965
You two, come here.

33
00:02:43,807 --> 00:02:45,877
Take this wagon to the palace.

34
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:54,363
Did the Commander tell you
what happened on his 1,000th landing?

35
00:02:54,447 --> 00:02:57,166
- I don't remember telling you what I did.
- Whatever.

36
00:02:57,247 --> 00:02:59,078
<i>He's landing on the Atlantia...</i>

37
00:02:59,167 --> 00:03:01,761
and he's been having this ongoing fight
with the LSO...

38
00:03:01,847 --> 00:03:03,997
and so he decides he'll stick it to him good.

39
00:03:04,087 --> 00:03:05,725
This has all been over-exaggerated.

40
00:03:07,607 --> 00:03:09,802
<i>Come on, people, watch them bake</i>

41
00:03:09,887 --> 00:03:12,162
<i>Three Little Cylons in the air</i>

42
00:03:12,247 --> 00:03:14,363
<i>Three Little Cylons in the air.</i>

43
00:03:14,447 --> 00:03:16,836
<i>Watch their metal burn and flare!</i>

44
00:03:17,687 --> 00:03:19,837
So, he skids to a stop on the flight deck...

45
00:03:19,927 --> 00:03:24,045
and the LSO hears over the wire
there's this big, loud, long, obnoxious...

46
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:30,758
I was young.
It was great. It was really funny.

47
00:03:30,927 --> 00:03:34,283
<i>Two Little Cylons jump in their cave</i>

48
00:03:35,047 --> 00:03:37,083
<i>Come on A-CARS make their grave!</i>

49
00:03:37,167 --> 00:03:38,520
The LSO is freaking out...

50
00:03:38,607 --> 00:03:40,837
your dad doesn't care because
he hates the guy.

51
00:03:40,927 --> 00:03:44,044
He figures he can get away with it
'cause it's his 1,000th landing.

52
00:03:44,127 --> 00:03:45,958
"I can get away with anything today!"

53
00:03:46,287 --> 00:03:48,596
<i>Watch that tin can hit the spot!</i>

54
00:03:56,327 --> 00:03:58,636
<i>Five Little Cylons in the grass</i>

55
00:04:03,247 --> 00:04:05,636
<i>Watch the Raptor light their ass!</i>

56
00:04:17,847 --> 00:04:20,156
<i>Attention!
Fire on the port hangar deck.</i>

57
00:04:20,247 --> 00:04:22,078
<i>Away the fire and rescue team...</i>

58
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:23,566
Let's go!

59
00:05:36,727 --> 00:05:39,924
Metal fatigue, old equipment.

60
00:05:42,367 --> 00:05:45,996
Worn strap fails, drops a million cubic drone
to the deck.

61
00:05:46,967 --> 00:05:49,959
Kills 13 pilots and lands seven more
in sick bay.

62
00:05:53,927 --> 00:05:56,316
It's hard to hear this,
but we got lucky.

63
00:05:56,407 --> 00:05:59,046
If that had been a missile
instead of a cone drone...

64
00:05:59,127 --> 00:06:01,277
it could've taken out the side of the ship.

65
00:06:02,207 --> 00:06:04,038
Never had a death in my hangar deck.

66
00:06:05,887 --> 00:06:09,243
Accidents. Never a death.

67
00:06:15,647 --> 00:06:17,478
Services for the dead.

68
00:06:17,927 --> 00:06:22,478
Services will commence
at 1100 hours on the forward hangar deck.

69
00:06:22,567 --> 00:06:25,161
<i>Mid-ship's hangar deck remains closed...</i>

70
00:06:25,247 --> 00:06:28,557
<i>for investigation and clean up
until further notice.</i>

71
00:06:30,407 --> 00:06:33,399
<i>Uniforms for the services will be
dress greys.</i>

72
00:06:35,967 --> 00:06:39,562
I wish I knew what to say,
words to make this better.

73
00:06:42,807 --> 00:06:45,765
Can anything make this better?
I don't know.

74
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,279
Attention on deck!

75
00:06:51,887 --> 00:06:53,286
As you were.

76
00:07:04,327 --> 00:07:06,443
May I?
Yes, sir.

77
00:07:18,127 --> 00:07:19,765
Are you Lt. Thrace?

78
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,720
Give me your eyes.

79
00:07:30,967 --> 00:07:33,276
I know this has been a hard day.

80
00:07:34,127 --> 00:07:36,595
There's been plenty of them lately.

81
00:07:38,727 --> 00:07:41,685
I can guarantee you
there'll be more to come.

82
00:07:43,607 --> 00:07:46,804
Remember your self-esteem.
Your self-respect.

83
00:07:47,727 --> 00:07:49,365
<i>And your self-worth.</i>

84
00:07:50,127 --> 00:07:53,278
Hold strong to them,
because people are watching.

85
00:07:54,727 --> 00:07:57,195
You're the guardians of the fleet.

86
00:07:58,887 --> 00:08:01,845
They need to know that they can
count on you.

87
00:08:02,967 --> 00:08:04,639
Even at a time like this.

88
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:13,005
Are you Lt. Thrace?

89
00:08:15,607 --> 00:08:17,837
I'm Cdr. Adama. Zak's father.

90
00:08:19,007 --> 00:08:21,441
I know, sir. I'm sorry, sir.

91
00:08:21,527 --> 00:08:24,724
I was planning on coming to see you
tomorrow before the funeral.

92
00:08:24,807 --> 00:08:26,445
You don't need to explain anything.

93
00:08:34,087 --> 00:08:35,486
Present arms!

94
00:08:41,327 --> 00:08:42,680
Order arms!

95
00:08:46,967 --> 00:08:50,084
Once again, we are charged
with the solemn duty...

96
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:53,679
to return the bodies of our own
to the universe...

97
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:56,725
from which the Lords of Kobol brought
them to us.

98
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:01,836
The burdens of this life are with us
but a short time.

99
00:09:03,087 --> 00:09:07,603
For Lt. Zak Adama,
son of William and Caroline Adama...

100
00:09:08,007 --> 00:09:10,885
brother of Lee, the time was too short.

101
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:14,846
But we take comfort in knowing
his life was willingly given...

102
00:09:14,927 --> 00:09:16,997
in service to all of us.

103
00:09:17,927 --> 00:09:19,838
We honour them for that.

104
00:09:20,447 --> 00:09:24,998
And, thus, it falls upon us
to repent our sins...

105
00:09:25,527 --> 00:09:28,280
and with the help of the Lords of Kobol...

106
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:31,404
make our own lives worthy of that gift.

107
00:09:33,007 --> 00:09:37,319
And now, we commit his body
to the ground from which we were all made.

108
00:09:38,687 --> 00:09:40,723
Secure in the knowledge...

109
00:09:41,087 --> 00:09:43,806
that we will be reunited with them...

110
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:47,243
in a better world to come.

111
00:10:28,407 --> 00:10:29,886
So say we all.

112
00:10:30,967 --> 00:10:32,639
So say we all.

113
00:10:42,127 --> 00:10:43,480
Present arms!

114
00:11:12,567 --> 00:11:14,319
Pilots we've known.

115
00:11:22,207 --> 00:11:24,357
I have to start training new pilots.

116
00:11:27,127 --> 00:11:28,242
There it is.

117
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:33,079
I kind of thought this was about that.

118
00:11:34,647 --> 00:11:37,684
I don't know if I'm the right person for this.

119
00:11:37,967 --> 00:11:40,242
- Do you know someone better?
- No.

120
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:44,955
But there's almost 50,000 people out there.

121
00:11:45,327 --> 00:11:47,921
Trying to tell me there's not one
flight instructor?

122
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:50,760
There's two. Civilians. Both.

123
00:11:51,247 --> 00:11:54,080
But I need someone
to teach combat tactics.

124
00:11:55,367 --> 00:11:58,200
You know, I don't know
if I'd be of any use to you.

125
00:11:58,287 --> 00:12:00,801
- I wasn't the most patient.
- Let's get down to it.

126
00:12:01,927 --> 00:12:03,599
This is about Zak.

127
00:12:05,807 --> 00:12:07,638
It was not your fault.

128
00:12:08,767 --> 00:12:11,520
You had nothing to do with what happened.

129
00:12:12,767 --> 00:12:14,519
It was an accident.

130
00:12:15,047 --> 00:12:18,676
Lee? Zak failed basic flight.

131
00:12:20,647 --> 00:12:24,037
- What?
- Or at least he should have, but he didn't...

132
00:12:24,487 --> 00:12:26,284
because I passed him.

133
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:30,000
His technique was sloppy
and he had no feel for flying...

134
00:12:30,087 --> 00:12:31,839
but I passed him.

135
00:12:32,487 --> 00:12:34,205
Because he and I...

136
00:12:36,167 --> 00:12:39,955
Because I felt something and I let it
get in the way of doing my job.

137
00:12:40,047 --> 00:12:41,799
<i>And I couldn't fail him.</i>

138
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:51,799
Zak passed basic flight.

139
00:12:52,807 --> 00:12:55,958
He was trained
and ready to sit in that cockpit.

140
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:01,242
What happened to him could've happened
to any qualified pilot.

141
00:13:01,327 --> 00:13:04,797
- You know that's true.
- Right.

142
00:13:06,967 --> 00:13:11,085
You did your job to the best of your ability.
That's all I can ask.

143
00:13:13,967 --> 00:13:17,118
I need new pilots.
And I want you to train them.

144
00:13:22,647 --> 00:13:24,126
I can do that.

145
00:13:38,727 --> 00:13:42,845
Just give them the attention and
the professionalism that you gave my son.

146
00:13:42,927 --> 00:13:45,395
And they'll be one hell of a squadron.

147
00:14:11,247 --> 00:14:13,636
Ten cubits says she takes him this time.

148
00:14:20,447 --> 00:14:21,766
You're on.

149
00:14:47,727 --> 00:14:50,878
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Ten to stay.

150
00:15:10,207 --> 00:15:14,564
So, Gaeta, how are you and the Doc here
doing on your Cylon detector?

151
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,044
What Cylon detector?

152
00:15:17,727 --> 00:15:20,719
Rumour has it
that Cylons look like people...

153
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,716
and you guys are working on a way
to weed them out, right?

154
00:15:26,167 --> 00:15:29,284
I want you to tell me the truth
about something.

155
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,960
You passed.

156
00:15:34,887 --> 00:15:37,606
By the skin of your teeth, but you passed.

157
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,759
I don't want any special treatment.
Not from my father...

158
00:15:40,847 --> 00:15:42,758
<i>and certainly not from you.</i>

159
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:45,839
If there were such a programme,
it would be classified...

160
00:15:45,927 --> 00:15:47,758
and I wouldn't be able to talk about it.

161
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:50,964
Something smells horrible in here.
Is that you, Crashdown?

162
00:15:51,047 --> 00:15:53,117
Yeah, that's me.
Your card.

163
00:15:54,927 --> 00:15:56,155
Your card.

164
00:15:56,967 --> 00:16:00,562
Zak, I'm a flight instructor.

165
00:16:01,367 --> 00:16:05,883
<i>I'm not going to send you to Vipers
if I don't think you got the chops. Okay?</i>

166
00:16:08,847 --> 00:16:10,803
Hello? Are you all right?

167
00:16:12,767 --> 00:16:13,882
Look...

168
00:16:30,967 --> 00:16:32,798
Maybe you'd like to take a break?

169
00:16:35,607 --> 00:16:37,563
I'm out of here.

170
00:16:39,087 --> 00:16:40,440
Starbuck?

171
00:16:43,607 --> 00:16:46,644
Okay, she can't do that.
She can and she did.

172
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:06,881
This is it.

173
00:17:11,527 --> 00:17:12,880
Restaurant.

174
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:17,122
I'm almost on top of the signal.

175
00:17:18,127 --> 00:17:19,196
I don't get it.

176
00:17:19,287 --> 00:17:22,359
How does a military coded signal
end up coming from in here?

177
00:17:22,607 --> 00:17:24,120
Let's find out.

178
00:17:39,007 --> 00:17:40,884
Nothing. Is that thing working?

179
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:45,478
I checked it three times.

180
00:17:53,327 --> 00:17:55,841
This thing says
we're right on top of it.

181
00:17:58,007 --> 00:17:59,235
Of what?

182
00:18:09,887 --> 00:18:10,922
What?

183
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:22,806
Helo.
You're frackking kidding me.

184
00:18:38,687 --> 00:18:40,757
Food. Medical supplies.

185
00:18:45,007 --> 00:18:47,043
Wait a minute, the signal.

186
00:18:58,527 --> 00:19:00,119
Disaster beacon.

187
00:19:00,567 --> 00:19:03,320
It's been set to go off if there was an attack.

188
00:19:03,847 --> 00:19:08,841
Some poor slob goes to all the trouble
of building a fallout shelter, stocks it...

189
00:19:09,327 --> 00:19:11,887
has a beacon, the whole planet...

190
00:19:13,727 --> 00:19:16,002
Then what? What happens to him?

191
00:19:19,647 --> 00:19:22,400
Let's just call ourselves lucky
and leave it at that.

192
00:20:01,927 --> 00:20:05,522
- Madame President.
- Would you close that curtain, please?

193
00:20:10,727 --> 00:20:11,762
Thank you.

194
00:20:11,847 --> 00:20:16,204
You are obviously an intelligent,
well-educated young woman.

195
00:20:16,527 --> 00:20:19,519
Would you mind explaining to me why
you waited five years...

196
00:20:19,607 --> 00:20:21,199
in between breast exams?

197
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:24,404
Yes, I would mind.
It's none of your business.

198
00:20:25,607 --> 00:20:26,960
I was busy.

199
00:20:28,407 --> 00:20:31,444
- And now, here you are.
- Yes. Here we are.

200
00:20:32,207 --> 00:20:35,404
- Would you mind?
- I do, actually.

201
00:20:36,447 --> 00:20:38,881
<i>Your doctor back on Caprica was right.</i>

202
00:20:38,967 --> 00:20:41,925
It's too damn late to operate,
the cancer is too far advanced.

203
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:45,363
We can try to shrink
the tumour with gamma treatments...

204
00:20:45,447 --> 00:20:47,677
and follow that up with IV cis-Doloxan.

205
00:20:47,767 --> 00:20:51,476
Did he explain to you the side-effects
of Doloxan?

206
00:20:51,727 --> 00:20:53,718
Hair loss, nausea, muscle degeneration.

207
00:20:53,807 --> 00:20:57,322
I watched my mother endure two years
of Doloxan before she died.

208
00:20:58,407 --> 00:21:01,319
I would like to explore alternate treatment.

209
00:21:02,167 --> 00:21:03,885
Prayer?
Witty.

210
00:21:04,887 --> 00:21:07,640
Have you ever heard of Chamalla extract?

211
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:11,796
Gods. You're one of those.
What if it works?

212
00:21:14,927 --> 00:21:17,566
All the evidence on Chamalla is anecdotal.

213
00:21:17,647 --> 00:21:20,798
It's nothing but a bunch
of loose talk and false hope.

214
00:21:20,887 --> 00:21:22,684
I'll take that as a yes.

215
00:21:25,807 --> 00:21:27,126
All right.

216
00:21:27,447 --> 00:21:30,598
I'll put out a med request
to the civilian fleet.

217
00:21:31,127 --> 00:21:34,437
Maybe there's some other wide-eyed dreamer
out there...

218
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:37,917
with a secret horde of Chamalla extract
in their luggage.

219
00:21:38,927 --> 00:21:41,760
Put your clothes back on now.
Thank you.

220
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:47,883
And for what it's worth...

221
00:21:48,847 --> 00:21:53,204
I would seriously consider prayer.

222
00:22:00,247 --> 00:22:02,602
Boonie jumpers. Shuttle jockies.

223
00:22:03,247 --> 00:22:07,001
And a Fleet Academy wash-out. This is
the best that you could come up with?

224
00:22:07,087 --> 00:22:09,521
- Diamonds in the rough.
- Yeah, right.

225
00:22:09,607 --> 00:22:12,121
They're the most qualified pilots
in the fleet.

226
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:13,322
Great!

227
00:22:15,647 --> 00:22:17,319
Attention on deck.

228
00:22:20,447 --> 00:22:23,598
That means get on your feet, nuggets!

229
00:22:27,567 --> 00:22:32,163
You are joining the Colonial Fleet,
boys and girls, not some after-school club.

230
00:22:32,247 --> 00:22:33,396
Seats.

231
00:22:38,927 --> 00:22:42,158
Pilots call me Starbuck,
but you may refer to me as God.

232
00:22:42,247 --> 00:22:45,603
<i>You've all flown before, but you're about
to enter a whole new world...</i>

233
00:22:45,687 --> 00:22:47,120
<i>so pay attention.</i>

234
00:22:47,207 --> 00:22:49,437
We don't have any flight simulators
on board...

235
00:22:49,527 --> 00:22:52,519
so we're putting you into the cockpit, today.

236
00:22:56,367 --> 00:22:58,164
<i>This is the Viper Mark II.</i>

237
00:22:58,247 --> 00:23:01,478
It's as manoeuvrable as a jack-rabbit,
and can flip end for end...

238
00:23:01,567 --> 00:23:03,762
in 0.35 seconds.

239
00:23:04,087 --> 00:23:07,602
You've never flown anything remotely like it,
so don't think that you have.

240
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:11,236
Today we'll do basic launch,
approach, and landing manoeuvres...

241
00:23:11,327 --> 00:23:14,125
and anyone not paying attention
is liable to end up...

242
00:23:14,207 --> 00:23:19,042
as a puddle or something to be hosed
out of the cockpit by the chief of the deck.

243
00:23:20,887 --> 00:23:23,162
She's laying it on a little thick.

244
00:23:23,767 --> 00:23:27,521
Costanza, right?
Yes, God, sir.

245
00:23:27,607 --> 00:23:30,804
Not anymore.
From now on, your name is "Hot Dog. "

246
00:23:30,887 --> 00:23:33,640
And when God speaks, Hot Dog, you listen.

247
00:23:33,727 --> 00:23:37,606
Maybe if you had learned that at
the Academy, you wouldn't have washed out.

248
00:23:42,407 --> 00:23:43,681
Sit up!

249
00:23:49,847 --> 00:23:53,806
<i>Viper 791 Galactica,
you are cleared for approach.</i>

250
00:23:55,327 --> 00:23:58,603
<i>Speed 175 port bay,
hands on approach...</i>

251
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,917
<i>checkers green. Call the ball.</i>

252
00:24:03,967 --> 00:24:05,639
I have the ball.

253
00:24:05,847 --> 00:24:07,565
<i>Easy on the throttle, Kat.</i>

254
00:24:09,007 --> 00:24:12,477
<i>Are you listening to me?
Don't chase the lights, okay?</i>

255
00:24:13,087 --> 00:24:16,124
<i>Roger, Starbuck.
Kat, don't chase the lights!</i>

256
00:24:16,207 --> 00:24:18,926
Set it by the numbers
and correct with thrusters.

257
00:24:23,127 --> 00:24:25,004
<i>Wave-off!</i>

258
00:24:27,127 --> 00:24:28,321
Punch it, Kat!

259
00:24:35,927 --> 00:24:40,239
Worse than awful.
Wretched beyond belief, actually.

260
00:24:41,247 --> 00:24:42,965
You call yourselves pilots.

261
00:24:43,127 --> 00:24:47,439
<i>It'll take the knuckle draggers a week to
pound your divots out of the flight deck.</i>

262
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:51,805
- With due respect, sir, that's unfair.
- Yes, sir. This was only our first day.

263
00:24:54,207 --> 00:24:56,243
No. It's your last.

264
00:24:56,847 --> 00:24:59,680
It would be criminal to let any of you
near a Viper again.

265
00:25:00,047 --> 00:25:03,244
So pack your gear and
get the hell off my ship. You're done.

266
00:25:21,007 --> 00:25:22,838
What are you doing here, Kara?

267
00:25:22,927 --> 00:25:26,158
- You can't wash them out on their first day.
- I just did.

268
00:25:27,927 --> 00:25:31,363
Look, I got 40 Vipers, and 21 pilots.
That's it.

269
00:25:32,007 --> 00:25:34,316
We are sitting ducks
until we finish water-op's.

270
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:38,480
We can't even maintain a CAP.
And Gods forbid the Cylons show up.

271
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:42,882
Gods forbid.
Let's bring in the next group of candidates.

272
00:25:43,087 --> 00:25:46,204
The next group has never even been
in a cockpit.

273
00:25:46,967 --> 00:25:50,482
- They're starting basic flight.
- Then they start basic flight.

274
00:25:50,567 --> 00:25:53,035
Because that group is done.
It says so right there.

275
00:25:53,127 --> 00:25:54,924
Maybe you should read it again.

276
00:25:56,047 --> 00:26:00,040
Lt. Thrace, this is not a request.
Well, Capt. Adama!

277
00:26:00,287 --> 00:26:03,962
I am the flight instructor, sir.
My word is scripture, sir.

278
00:26:04,247 --> 00:26:08,035
I will not, repeat, not pass
another student who isn't ready.

279
00:26:09,047 --> 00:26:10,844
So, that's what this is about.

280
00:26:11,567 --> 00:26:14,639
It's not them. It's Zak.

281
00:26:18,207 --> 00:26:19,686
Careful.

282
00:26:21,127 --> 00:26:22,924
Step back.

283
00:26:55,167 --> 00:26:58,045
Starbuck says they can't cut it,
they can't cut it.

284
00:26:58,127 --> 00:27:00,357
She's not giving them a chance. It's Day 1.

285
00:27:00,447 --> 00:27:03,439
She's one of the finest pilots
I've ever seen in my life.

286
00:27:03,567 --> 00:27:07,116
One day in the cockpit is all she needs
to know if they can hack it or not.

287
00:27:07,207 --> 00:27:10,005
She got that.
I'm not arguing that, sir.

288
00:27:10,407 --> 00:27:14,525
I'm just saying that I think she's letting her
personal feelings cloud her judgment.

289
00:27:14,607 --> 00:27:16,598
Please sit down, Captain.

290
00:27:19,287 --> 00:27:21,278
What are those feelings?

291
00:27:24,567 --> 00:27:25,966
About Zak.

292
00:27:27,567 --> 00:27:30,365
- We've talked about, Zak.
- You did?

293
00:27:30,447 --> 00:27:32,563
We've talked about a lot of things.

294
00:27:32,647 --> 00:27:36,401
We've been aboard this ship for over
two years. We know each other very well.

295
00:27:37,327 --> 00:27:39,477
When I asked her to be the instructor...

296
00:27:39,567 --> 00:27:43,003
I knew it was going to release
a lot of loose baggage.

297
00:27:43,567 --> 00:27:47,879
She acknowledged it.
She's a professional. She'll do her job.

298
00:27:51,767 --> 00:27:52,756
Okay.

299
00:27:55,087 --> 00:27:58,636
I'm just saying that you should talk to her.

300
00:27:58,727 --> 00:28:01,036
She's walking around
with a lot of emotion.

301
00:28:01,127 --> 00:28:03,641
She almost decked me in the rec room.

302
00:28:05,127 --> 00:28:08,483
Right. You wouldn't smile if you were there.

303
00:28:09,367 --> 00:28:11,437
- I'll talk to her.
- Thank you.

304
00:28:14,447 --> 00:28:15,926
Personally...

305
00:28:16,367 --> 00:28:20,121
I think she's trying to work out her guilt
over what she did for Zak.

306
00:28:20,207 --> 00:28:23,483
I think she's making up for it
by beating up on these guys.

307
00:28:23,567 --> 00:28:26,161
Guilt? Over what?

308
00:28:26,887 --> 00:28:28,764
What did she do for Zak?

309
00:28:30,967 --> 00:28:33,879
- I thought you just said...
- What did she do?

310
00:28:38,767 --> 00:28:42,680
It's not my place to say and I've already said
more than I should have.

311
00:28:43,487 --> 00:28:46,797
- You'll have to ask her. I'm sorry.
- Captain, just...

312
00:28:46,887 --> 00:28:48,957
Dad, you'll have to ask her.

313
00:28:51,487 --> 00:28:53,478
<i>I don't want any special treatment.</i>

314
00:28:53,567 --> 00:28:56,843
<i>Not from my father,
and certainly not from you.</i>

315
00:29:09,167 --> 00:29:10,725
You passed.

316
00:29:10,967 --> 00:29:13,606
By the skin of your teeth, but you passed.

317
00:29:15,367 --> 00:29:18,120
<i>Attention.
Pass the word to Lt. Thrace.</i>

318
00:29:18,207 --> 00:29:21,199
<i>Lt. Thrace, please report
to the CO's quarters.</i>

319
00:29:33,327 --> 00:29:34,760
Yes. Come in.

320
00:29:36,167 --> 00:29:38,920
Lee was just here before.
I knew it.

321
00:29:43,727 --> 00:29:46,195
He thinks you washed out...

322
00:29:46,807 --> 00:29:49,196
the nuggets without giving them a chance.

323
00:29:50,127 --> 00:29:52,357
They didn't cut it. That's it.

324
00:29:56,407 --> 00:30:00,958
He thought you were letting
personal feelings cloud your judgment.

325
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,487
Really?
Your feelings about Zak.

326
00:30:07,927 --> 00:30:09,679
That's not the case.

327
00:30:12,767 --> 00:30:13,756
Okay.

328
00:30:16,127 --> 00:30:18,118
He said something else.

329
00:30:19,847 --> 00:30:23,635
He said something that
I would like to ask you directly.

330
00:30:28,487 --> 00:30:33,242
He said that you might be feeling
guilty about something that you did for Zak.

331
00:30:34,247 --> 00:30:36,203
What did you do for him?

332
00:30:37,007 --> 00:30:40,443
I don't know. Ask Lee.
I'm asking you.

333
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,480
I don't know...

334
00:30:43,167 --> 00:30:45,635
I don't really know
what he was talking about, so...

335
00:30:45,727 --> 00:30:47,763
Don't fence with me, Kara.

336
00:30:48,567 --> 00:30:51,718
I love you like a daughter.
I don't deserve that.

337
00:31:03,607 --> 00:31:07,839
Zak failed basic flight.

338
00:31:12,607 --> 00:31:16,043
He wasn't a bad pilot.
He just had no feel for flying.

339
00:31:22,767 --> 00:31:26,885
And when it came to his final check-ride,
he busted...

340
00:31:28,047 --> 00:31:30,197
three of the test manoeuvres.

341
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:33,441
And I should have flunked him, but I didn't.

342
00:31:38,087 --> 00:31:40,965
The bottom line is that your son...

343
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:45,640
didn't have the chops to fly a Viper.

344
00:31:48,327 --> 00:31:49,999
And it killed him.

345
00:31:54,487 --> 00:31:57,638
He told me that you were
an amazing instructor.

346
00:31:59,487 --> 00:32:03,116
<i>And that he was involved with you,
and that it was serious.</i>

347
00:32:03,567 --> 00:32:07,242
He asked me to come to his graduation
from flight school...

348
00:32:07,807 --> 00:32:11,561
- to watch him get his wings.
- I know. I read the letter.

349
00:32:12,807 --> 00:32:14,035
I see.

350
00:32:15,487 --> 00:32:18,763
Then, maybe you can tell me
what he was hinting at.

351
00:32:19,087 --> 00:32:20,918
Surprise, about you.

352
00:32:24,087 --> 00:32:25,918
We were going to...

353
00:32:27,887 --> 00:32:30,276
You know what, it's not important.

354
00:32:30,367 --> 00:32:33,404
- I don't want that to...
- You were engaged, right?

355
00:32:40,287 --> 00:32:42,801
You did it because you were engaged.

356
00:32:56,367 --> 00:32:58,403
Because I made a mistake.

357
00:33:00,327 --> 00:33:01,999
And because I was just...

358
00:33:03,087 --> 00:33:05,317
I was so in love with him.

359
00:33:08,007 --> 00:33:11,044
And I let that get in the way of doing my job.

360
00:33:17,487 --> 00:33:22,003
He just wanted it so much and I didn't want
to be the one who crushed him.

361
00:33:29,647 --> 00:33:33,037
Reinstate the trainees to flight status.

362
00:33:34,047 --> 00:33:35,241
I will.

363
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:40,160
- I just want you to understand that I...
- Do your job.

364
00:33:44,367 --> 00:33:45,561
Yes, sir.

365
00:33:46,167 --> 00:33:49,204
And walk out of this cabin
while you still can.

366
00:34:33,007 --> 00:34:36,522
Unpack your gear.
You are all returned to flight status.

367
00:34:38,127 --> 00:34:39,685
We're going to try this again.

368
00:34:39,767 --> 00:34:43,442
<i>Those of you who can be trained to safely fly
the Viper Mark II will pass.</i>

369
00:34:43,527 --> 00:34:45,961
Those of you who cannot, will be cut.

370
00:34:46,327 --> 00:34:50,445
It's my job to figure out which
is which, without personal feeling either way.

371
00:34:52,727 --> 00:34:54,797
And I'm going to do my job.

372
00:34:57,287 --> 00:35:00,199
Kat, Chuckles, Hot Dog, you're up first.

373
00:35:02,247 --> 00:35:04,556
Pre-flight briefing in 20 minutes.

374
00:35:13,967 --> 00:35:16,720
<i>Where the hell
are you going, Hot Dog? Stay on me.</i>

375
00:35:16,807 --> 00:35:19,321
<i>Target acquired and destroyed.</i>

376
00:35:20,527 --> 00:35:23,724
<i>Not bad, Hot Dog,
but you left your leader behind.</i>

377
00:35:23,807 --> 00:35:26,275
<i>Looks like you're having a bad day,
Hot Dog.</i>

378
00:35:28,087 --> 00:35:31,557
<i>- And the moral of this story is?
- Never leave your leader.</i>

379
00:35:32,927 --> 00:35:35,043
<i>Thank you. That is correct.</i>

380
00:35:35,807 --> 00:35:37,763
<i>You never want to be out here alone.</i>

381
00:35:39,527 --> 00:35:42,405
<i>Okay, Chuckles, take Kat's wing.
Hot Dog, you're on me.</i>

382
00:35:42,487 --> 00:35:44,955
<i>We'll try a little manoeuvre called
"Thorch Weave. "</i>

383
00:35:45,047 --> 00:35:47,845
I'll be damned. What's got into Starbuck?

384
00:35:48,327 --> 00:35:51,364
She actually sounds like
a real instructor for a change.

385
00:35:53,447 --> 00:35:57,440
She may actually make Viper pilots
out of some of those nuggets after all.

386
00:36:05,487 --> 00:36:07,717
<i>Holy crap, we've got incoming.</i>

387
00:36:09,487 --> 00:36:11,796
Where the hell did they come from?

388
00:36:14,127 --> 00:36:16,322
<i>Dradis. Multiple contacts.</i>

389
00:36:19,367 --> 00:36:22,279
It's the Cylons.
Why didn't we see them coming?

390
00:36:22,367 --> 00:36:24,562
Launch the alert fighters.

391
00:36:24,967 --> 00:36:28,084
<i>Attention! Set Condition 1
throughout the fleet.</i>

392
00:36:28,367 --> 00:36:32,440
<i>Galactica, send the Calvary.
Nuggets, punch it for home.</i>

393
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:43,757
Where's the base ship?
No base ships detected, sir.

394
00:36:43,847 --> 00:36:48,602
<i>Eight raiders, bearing 047
carom 118. Range 22,000.</i>

395
00:36:48,687 --> 00:36:51,201
They found us. It was only a matter of time.

396
00:36:53,407 --> 00:36:56,683
<i>Galactica, Starbuck.
Where the hell are the alert fighters?</i>

397
00:37:04,327 --> 00:37:06,966
<i>Starbuck, Alert One.
Be there in two minutes.</i>

398
00:37:08,967 --> 00:37:10,559
The Cylons are gaining!

399
00:37:11,127 --> 00:37:12,719
<i>All right, listen up, nuggets.</i>

400
00:37:12,967 --> 00:37:17,438
<i>Stay together and keep your throttles
firewalled until you hit the deck.</i>

401
00:37:18,287 --> 00:37:19,276
<i>Now, go.</i>

402
00:37:28,767 --> 00:37:32,077
What's she doing?
Starbuck's gonna take on all eight.

403
00:37:35,007 --> 00:37:36,804
And get herself killed.

404
00:37:44,207 --> 00:37:46,402
<i>Hot Dog, where are you going?</i>

405
00:37:55,927 --> 00:37:57,758
<i>Hot Dog, what are you doing?</i>

406
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:02,955
<i>Got one!
Hot Dog! Get out of here!</i>

407
00:38:04,727 --> 00:38:06,957
<i>Hot Dog, I told you
to get your ass home!</i>

408
00:38:07,047 --> 00:38:08,878
<i>You said never
to leave your leader.</i>

409
00:38:08,967 --> 00:38:11,162
<i>I also said
never to disobey an order.</i>

410
00:38:13,567 --> 00:38:15,603
<i>- I'm hit!
- I got you, Hot Dog!</i>

411
00:38:15,687 --> 00:38:18,247
<i>We're going to make it through this.
Break right. Now!</i>

412
00:38:33,487 --> 00:38:34,715
She'll make it.

413
00:38:38,687 --> 00:38:40,484
<i>I just lost all three mains.</i>

414
00:38:41,447 --> 00:38:45,565
<i>It's all right, Hot Dog. You did good.
We're gonna be okay, I promise you.</i>

415
00:38:52,047 --> 00:38:54,003
At least one of us will.

416
00:38:54,367 --> 00:38:57,245
<i>That about does it.
I think there's only one left.</i>

417
00:39:02,767 --> 00:39:03,756
Frack!

418
00:39:06,767 --> 00:39:09,406
<i>He's right on my tail,
but I got it covered.</i>

419
00:39:13,527 --> 00:39:16,041
Starbuck's wireless and transponder
just cut out.

420
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:20,521
<i>Alert One, we spotted Hot Dog.
No ID or visual on Starbuck.</i>

421
00:39:42,367 --> 00:39:43,561
Frack me!
