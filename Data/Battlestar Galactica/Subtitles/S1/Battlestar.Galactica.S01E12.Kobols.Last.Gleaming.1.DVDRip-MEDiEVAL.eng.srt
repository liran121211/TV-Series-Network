1
00:00:02,207 --> 00:00:04,323
<i>Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.</i>

2
00:00:34,687 --> 00:00:35,881
Like my new toy?

3
00:00:35,967 --> 00:00:37,161
<i>It's my very own Cylon Raider.</i>

4
00:00:37,247 --> 00:00:40,717
Boy, when you take a souvenir,
you don't screw around.

5
00:00:43,887 --> 00:00:47,675
Congratulations, Doctor.
You've just uncovered your very first Cylon.

6
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:49,565
<i>She probably doesn't know.</i>

7
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:51,764
If something happened to you...

8
00:00:51,847 --> 00:00:53,565
I wouldn't know how to deal with it.

9
00:00:53,647 --> 00:00:55,126
I feel the same way.

10
00:00:57,847 --> 00:00:58,996
I'm a Cylon.

11
00:00:59,647 --> 00:01:02,719
Helo, come with me. Helo.

12
00:01:04,327 --> 00:01:06,124
<i>Helo, come with me!</i>

13
00:01:06,207 --> 00:01:08,596
New piece of equipment
that just appeared in CIC.

14
00:01:08,687 --> 00:01:10,405
He had this when we found him.

15
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,478
<i>Send it to Galactica. The lab can look at it.</i>

16
00:01:12,567 --> 00:01:13,841
It's a Cylon device.

17
00:01:13,927 --> 00:01:17,124
I'll continue to take the Chamalla.
It has other benefits.

18
00:01:17,887 --> 00:01:19,366
The hallucinations?

19
00:01:19,447 --> 00:01:20,846
You're going to find Kobol.

20
00:01:20,927 --> 00:01:22,724
Birthplace of us all.

21
00:01:23,007 --> 00:01:27,000
He says we're gonna find Kobol,
and that it's gonna lead us to Earth.

22
00:01:55,487 --> 00:01:56,920
You all right?

23
00:02:58,487 --> 00:03:00,000
You all right?

24
00:03:18,047 --> 00:03:20,038
Stop! Don't come any closer.

25
00:03:40,447 --> 00:03:41,800
Just do it.

26
00:04:04,287 --> 00:04:06,596
Oh, Lee!

27
00:04:34,327 --> 00:04:35,442
Oh, God.

28
00:04:49,007 --> 00:04:51,840
<i>Attention.
Pass the word for Lt. Valerii.</i>

29
00:04:52,127 --> 00:04:55,756
<i>Lt. Valerii, report to the Ready Room
for a pre-flight briefing.</i>

30
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,638
You don't lose control.

31
00:05:12,727 --> 00:05:13,921
Thanks.

32
00:05:15,487 --> 00:05:16,476
No.

33
00:05:17,407 --> 00:05:20,797
You got to lose control.
Let your instincts take over.

34
00:05:20,967 --> 00:05:23,162
I thought we were just sparring.

35
00:05:24,967 --> 00:05:26,958
That's why you don't win.

36
00:08:01,167 --> 00:08:04,364
The doctor said I have six months
at the outside.

37
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:11,077
He said the cancer's moved
into my lymphatic system.

38
00:08:12,127 --> 00:08:14,004
Aggressively moved in.

39
00:08:18,847 --> 00:08:21,077
I want you to hear me on this.

40
00:08:23,247 --> 00:08:25,681
You made a true believer out of me.

41
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:28,601
Strange as that sounds, considering.

42
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:30,800
But I believe.

43
00:08:32,127 --> 00:08:35,324
I know you're the one to lead us
to our salvation.

44
00:08:36,247 --> 00:08:39,444
You are going to guide us to Earth.

45
00:08:44,207 --> 00:08:46,357
Then we better find it soon.

46
00:08:49,527 --> 00:08:51,643
- I'm out.
- Like it's yours.

47
00:08:51,727 --> 00:08:53,797
- I picked up your five.
- Frankly, I don't care.

48
00:08:53,887 --> 00:08:56,924
No, thank you, Doctor, I have a watch later.

49
00:08:57,007 --> 00:08:58,326
Crashdown hits. Davis?

50
00:08:58,407 --> 00:08:59,522
What?

51
00:08:59,607 --> 00:09:02,246
A little bit of this.
A little bit of that.

52
00:09:02,327 --> 00:09:03,965
You guys always play this slow?

53
00:09:04,047 --> 00:09:05,196
What did you say?

54
00:09:05,287 --> 00:09:07,323
Don't distract me.

55
00:09:07,407 --> 00:09:08,760
Uncanny, I know.

56
00:09:08,847 --> 00:09:11,998
All right, 20, I call.
And I raise you another 30.

57
00:09:13,327 --> 00:09:15,397
You can't compete with me.

58
00:09:16,487 --> 00:09:17,806
I always win.

59
00:09:18,527 --> 00:09:19,642
I'm sorry.

60
00:09:20,247 --> 00:09:22,715
Never seen you like this, Gaius.

61
00:09:23,087 --> 00:09:25,282
It's disappointing somehow.

62
00:09:25,967 --> 00:09:27,195
Common.

63
00:09:30,767 --> 00:09:32,803
So sorry to disappoint you.

64
00:09:35,327 --> 00:09:37,079
Disappoint you all.

65
00:09:37,607 --> 00:09:38,835
<i>Thirty.</i>

66
00:09:40,687 --> 00:09:42,120
And I call it.

67
00:09:42,967 --> 00:09:44,764
What do you got, buddy?

68
00:09:44,847 --> 00:09:46,758
- Absolutely nothing.
- Not bad, Crash.

69
00:09:46,847 --> 00:09:48,360
But not compared to that.

70
00:09:48,447 --> 00:09:49,721
Oh!
You are...

71
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,917
No!
You win every time.

72
00:09:53,007 --> 00:09:55,237
Sorry, I have to do it.

73
00:09:56,167 --> 00:09:58,044
Very sorry to disappoint you.

74
00:09:58,127 --> 00:10:00,402
There's a card game...
Hey.

75
00:10:00,487 --> 00:10:03,320
She's back on her feet, ladies and gentlemen.

76
00:10:06,847 --> 00:10:08,519
- How are you feeling?
- Hey, Gaius.

77
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:09,676
Good.

78
00:10:09,767 --> 00:10:13,316
Mr. Vice President,
if you don't mind, Lt. Thrace.

79
00:10:13,767 --> 00:10:18,522
Some level of decorum must be maintained,
or is it a pirate ship you're running?

80
00:10:19,087 --> 00:10:20,964
No. Just a Battlestar, sir.

81
00:10:21,047 --> 00:10:22,719
All right, let's play.

82
00:10:23,887 --> 00:10:25,798
Would you like to play?

83
00:10:25,887 --> 00:10:28,879
Maybe you'd like to sit next to Capt. Adama?

84
00:10:28,967 --> 00:10:31,561
Sure, Kara. Why don't you pull up a pew?

85
00:10:31,647 --> 00:10:34,684
No, that's okay, Lee. I've got things to do.

86
00:10:35,087 --> 00:10:37,317
Nothing's wild. Here we go.

87
00:10:46,327 --> 00:10:47,646
All right, currency.

88
00:10:47,727 --> 00:10:50,560
While bartering will continue
for the foreseeable future...

89
00:10:50,647 --> 00:10:54,037
we do have a system in place now
to take the economy back...

90
00:10:54,127 --> 00:10:55,640
to a currency-based standard.

91
00:10:55,727 --> 00:10:57,319
Do you love her?

92
00:10:58,087 --> 00:10:59,406
Did you...

93
00:11:01,487 --> 00:11:03,079
Dr. Baltar...

94
00:11:04,367 --> 00:11:07,916
if something should happen to me,
it is vital that you comprehend...

95
00:11:08,007 --> 00:11:12,000
and are familiar with the political structures
beginning to fall into place here.

96
00:11:12,087 --> 00:11:14,601
- Do you understand this?
- Answer me.

97
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:17,162
Yes, of course I understand.

98
00:11:17,807 --> 00:11:19,365
My answer is no.

99
00:11:19,527 --> 00:11:21,802
No, I don't think I can handle this right now.

100
00:11:21,887 --> 00:11:25,721
The intricacies of the bureaucracy,
I can't get my head around.

101
00:11:25,967 --> 00:11:28,686
This which,
with all due respect, Madam President...

102
00:11:28,767 --> 00:11:33,204
you have spent your entire political career
learning to understand.

103
00:11:33,287 --> 00:11:34,322
More to the point...

104
00:11:34,407 --> 00:11:37,638
how you could think that
my head could be turned so quickly...

105
00:11:37,727 --> 00:11:39,399
by a new thing...

106
00:11:41,847 --> 00:11:43,599
it just astounds me.

107
00:11:46,287 --> 00:11:49,962
How did you seriously think I could
cope with this kind of responsibility?

108
00:11:50,047 --> 00:11:51,321
I don't believe you.

109
00:11:51,407 --> 00:11:53,284
You're a genius, are you not?

110
00:11:53,367 --> 00:11:56,439
Well, quite frankly,
I don't give a flying frack...

111
00:11:56,527 --> 00:11:59,997
whether you believe me or not. All right?
Because I've had it.

112
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:04,842
I am tired of being pushed and
prodded around like I'm some kind of toy.

113
00:12:05,407 --> 00:12:08,046
- I'm not your plaything.
- Plaything?

114
00:12:09,367 --> 00:12:10,846
I don't work for you!

115
00:12:10,927 --> 00:12:13,487
And quite frankly,
I don't have to sit here anymore...

116
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:16,525
and take this kind of abuse
from either of you!

117
00:12:16,927 --> 00:12:17,996
<i>You either!</i>

118
00:12:18,087 --> 00:12:21,841
Either in here, either in there.
Wherever it is, I don't need to take it.

119
00:12:22,127 --> 00:12:24,595
- I love you, Gaius.
- Do me a favour.

120
00:12:25,127 --> 00:12:26,321
Yeah?

121
00:12:26,527 --> 00:12:29,917
I think perhaps you need a break from this.

122
00:12:31,127 --> 00:12:32,526
You're right.

123
00:12:34,807 --> 00:12:36,479
We need a break.

124
00:12:55,087 --> 00:12:57,396
I'd like to be alone if you don't mind.

125
00:12:58,727 --> 00:13:01,560
How can you love her, Gaius?
I don't.

126
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:05,083
You can't lie to me,
I know everything you know.

127
00:13:15,287 --> 00:13:16,879
That's lovely.

128
00:13:17,527 --> 00:13:18,880
Thank you.

129
00:13:20,247 --> 00:13:21,521
Did you...

130
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:25,559
Did you want
something in particular this time?

131
00:13:25,647 --> 00:13:27,717
I thought you should know...

132
00:13:27,887 --> 00:13:30,685
<i>that it's not safe to remain on Galactica.</i>

133
00:13:31,767 --> 00:13:33,837
What are you talking about?

134
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,519
It's a surprise.

135
00:13:37,167 --> 00:13:40,398
Tell me, what is it? What is it?

136
00:13:41,407 --> 00:13:44,205
Is it a bomb? Another Cylon bomb, right?

137
00:13:46,127 --> 00:13:47,685
Is it an agent?

138
00:13:48,047 --> 00:13:50,686
Is a Cylon agent about to be activated?

139
00:13:52,047 --> 00:13:53,366
Tell me!

140
00:14:03,567 --> 00:14:07,401
<i>Galactica, this is Raptor 1
preparing to jump to Sector 728.</i>

141
00:14:07,807 --> 00:14:10,162
<i>Let's hope we find some supplies out there.</i>

142
00:14:10,247 --> 00:14:13,080
<i>Roger that. Good hunting out there.</i>

143
00:14:13,167 --> 00:14:15,203
Crash, counter our spinner?

144
00:14:15,447 --> 00:14:17,165
Fuel drive's spun up and ready.

145
00:14:17,247 --> 00:14:20,683
Jump in five, four, three, two, one.

146
00:14:24,647 --> 00:14:26,160
Whoa, baby!

147
00:14:28,967 --> 00:14:30,241
Frack me!

148
00:14:37,727 --> 00:14:39,683
Gaeta, the fracking idiot.

149
00:14:41,287 --> 00:14:44,836
You can't plan a jump that close to a planet.
What if we jumped into it?

150
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:48,078
It was great. It's fine. We made it. We're cool.

151
00:15:02,327 --> 00:15:04,966
Are you seeing this?
Yeah.

152
00:15:10,287 --> 00:15:11,640
Oceans.

153
00:15:12,447 --> 00:15:13,516
<i>Continents.</i>

154
00:15:14,007 --> 00:15:15,998
No. Let me at this thing.

155
00:15:18,967 --> 00:15:22,437
Okay. Atmosphere reads as:

156
00:15:24,047 --> 00:15:27,323
Nitrogen, oxygen. Looks like enough CO2
for green leafy things.

157
00:15:27,407 --> 00:15:30,126
<i>I'm getting excited here, Boomer.</i>

158
00:15:30,207 --> 00:15:31,401
Boomer, this could be it.

159
00:15:31,487 --> 00:15:36,163
This could be the big one. This is the little
planet that solves all our problems.

160
00:15:36,487 --> 00:15:37,806
Boomer?

161
00:15:40,127 --> 00:15:42,277
Do you think this is Earth?

162
00:15:43,287 --> 00:15:45,005
No. It's not Earth.

163
00:15:46,367 --> 00:15:48,483
It's more important than that.

164
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:15,040
Doesn't really work as well as before, huh?

165
00:16:19,367 --> 00:16:21,278
You know, I do get cold.

166
00:16:26,447 --> 00:16:28,483
There's some things you should know, Helo.

167
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:30,319
Don't call me that.

168
00:16:31,207 --> 00:16:32,959
You're not even Sharon.

169
00:16:33,047 --> 00:16:35,561
You're not even human.
So don't act like you know me...

170
00:16:35,647 --> 00:16:36,762
because you don't!

171
00:16:36,847 --> 00:16:40,317
But I am Sharon! And that's part
of what you need to understand!

172
00:16:42,887 --> 00:16:45,082
Sharon was a friend of mine!

173
00:16:45,727 --> 00:16:49,766
Whatever twisted thing you are,
you are not Sharon! You got that?

174
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:54,604
The only thing I want from you
is a way off this fracked up world. That's it!

175
00:17:04,127 --> 00:17:05,685
Going hunting?

176
00:17:07,967 --> 00:17:10,356
I'm adding a gunnery run
to the jump test tomorrow.

177
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:13,723
See if our boy
can shoot anything with our ammo.

178
00:17:14,207 --> 00:17:15,959
So it's a boy now?

179
00:17:17,007 --> 00:17:18,679
I changed my mind.

180
00:17:18,887 --> 00:17:23,039
You ever wonder why
everyone calls it a she, but to you, it's a he?

181
00:17:23,407 --> 00:17:26,365
It's fascinating, Lee.
You should write a paper.

182
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,518
It's not really my scene.

183
00:17:28,727 --> 00:17:32,117
I'm not as smart as, say, Dr. Baltar.

184
00:17:36,487 --> 00:17:38,443
How is the Vice President,
by the way?

185
00:17:38,527 --> 00:17:40,802
I don't know. Haven't seen him.

186
00:17:43,807 --> 00:17:47,117
So he's a "love them and leave them"
kind of guy, I guess.

187
00:17:47,207 --> 00:17:48,526
I guess.

188
00:17:51,767 --> 00:17:54,235
Ships just pass in the night.
Yup.

189
00:17:56,727 --> 00:17:58,240
Didn't mean a thing.

190
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,362
Nope.

191
00:17:59,447 --> 00:18:01,403
Just bored. Looking for something to do.

192
00:18:01,487 --> 00:18:05,116
So fracking the Vice President
seemed like a great way to waste some time.

193
00:18:05,207 --> 00:18:07,084
- You want something from me?
- Not a thing.

194
00:18:07,167 --> 00:18:09,601
- I don't owe you anything.
- You don't owe me anything.

195
00:18:09,687 --> 00:18:11,757
Because I'm just a CAG,
and you're just a pilot.

196
00:18:11,847 --> 00:18:14,839
- Right.
- A pilot that can't keep her pants on!

197
00:18:15,607 --> 00:18:16,756
Right.

198
00:18:17,647 --> 00:18:19,444
It's just like old times, Kara.

199
00:18:19,527 --> 00:18:23,884
Like when you got drunk and couldn't keep
your hands off the major from wherever...

200
00:18:26,167 --> 00:18:27,282
God!

201
00:18:33,207 --> 00:18:35,562
Why did you do it, Kara? Just tell me why.

202
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,719
Because I'm a screw-up, Lee.
Try and keep that in mind.

203
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:45,596
Commander Adama is
sending out another Raptor...

204
00:18:45,687 --> 00:18:47,643
to conduct an aerial survey of this planet.

205
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:50,799
It appears to have suffered
some sort of calamity...

206
00:18:50,887 --> 00:18:53,447
but it could actually be inhabitable.

207
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:57,601
Aerial survey shows evidence
of at least one city on the surface.

208
00:18:57,687 --> 00:18:59,643
It was obviously abandoned
long ago.

209
00:18:59,727 --> 00:19:01,240
How old are the ruins?

210
00:19:01,327 --> 00:19:03,682
We won't know for sure
until we send a ground team...

211
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,758
but the initial estimates have it...

212
00:19:05,847 --> 00:19:08,486
on the order of approximately 2,000 years.

213
00:19:08,567 --> 00:19:11,764
That's around the time
the 13 Tribes first left Kobol.

214
00:19:11,847 --> 00:19:13,565
Let me see.

215
00:19:20,607 --> 00:19:22,598
<i>Ruins? What ruins?</i>

216
00:19:23,367 --> 00:19:25,483
This is an inhabited city.

217
00:19:27,447 --> 00:19:28,926
<i>Look at the buildings.</i>

218
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,400
Buildings?

219
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:35,960
Look.

220
00:19:48,847 --> 00:19:52,635
What did you see? Tell me, Laura.

221
00:20:03,687 --> 00:20:07,839
A dome-like structure with six roads
leading out of it like spokes.

222
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:12,922
With something around it like columns, like
a forum, like the forum on Caprica, actually.

223
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:31,477
The forum in the opera house
in the city of the gods on Kobol.

224
00:20:37,647 --> 00:20:40,684
This planet is Kobol.

225
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:49,758
Kobol like Kobol?

226
00:20:50,247 --> 00:20:52,238
The birthplace of mankind.

227
00:20:52,327 --> 00:20:54,477
Where the gods and man lived in paradise.

228
00:20:54,567 --> 00:20:57,365
Until the exodus of the 13 Tribes.

229
00:21:09,447 --> 00:21:12,041
Madam President, what's going on?

230
00:21:19,247 --> 00:21:23,604
It's real. The scriptures, the myths,
the prophecies. They're all real.

231
00:21:25,007 --> 00:21:26,406
So say we all.

232
00:21:45,007 --> 00:21:46,725
Hello, Lieutenant.

233
00:21:50,407 --> 00:21:51,556
Hey, Doc.

234
00:22:00,847 --> 00:22:02,883
This is a bad time, right?

235
00:22:03,207 --> 00:22:05,516
No. I'm just cleaning my gun.

236
00:22:10,087 --> 00:22:11,725
What's going on?

237
00:22:12,407 --> 00:22:15,205
I was going to ask you the same question.

238
00:22:15,327 --> 00:22:18,399
Actually, I was looking
for Lt. Thrace.

239
00:22:25,647 --> 00:22:28,957
But sometimes,
it's good to talk these things over.

240
00:22:29,367 --> 00:22:31,244
Deep down, she knows she's a Cylon.

241
00:22:32,607 --> 00:22:35,326
But her conscious mind won't accept it.

242
00:22:36,047 --> 00:22:38,686
Sometimes I have these dark thoughts.

243
00:22:40,167 --> 00:22:43,318
- What kind of dark thoughts?
- Her model is weak.

244
00:22:45,727 --> 00:22:47,365
Always has been.

245
00:22:48,047 --> 00:22:50,686
But in the end, she'll carry out her mission.

246
00:22:51,447 --> 00:22:52,926
I don't know.

247
00:22:53,887 --> 00:22:57,277
But I'm afraid I'm going to hurt someone.
I feel like I have to be stopped.

248
00:22:57,367 --> 00:23:00,120
She can't be stopped. She's a Cylon.

249
00:23:01,927 --> 00:23:03,997
You can't help her, Gaius.

250
00:23:05,607 --> 00:23:10,362
But you could probably sleep with her.
That's what you want, right?

251
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:15,240
I'm not sure why...

252
00:23:21,847 --> 00:23:23,280
Sometimes...

253
00:23:25,047 --> 00:23:28,562
we must embrace that which opens up for us.

254
00:23:32,407 --> 00:23:33,681
Embrace?

255
00:23:37,767 --> 00:23:39,644
Life can be a curse...

256
00:23:40,687 --> 00:23:42,564
as well as a blessing.

257
00:23:47,887 --> 00:23:50,560
You will believe me when I tell you...

258
00:23:51,487 --> 00:23:56,003
there are far worse things than death
in this world.

259
00:23:57,447 --> 00:23:59,756
So you're saying...
No.

260
00:24:02,967 --> 00:24:06,118
What I say is meaningless.

261
00:24:09,327 --> 00:24:11,124
Listen to your heart.

262
00:24:12,567 --> 00:24:15,923
Embrace that which you know
to be the right decision.

263
00:25:01,127 --> 00:25:03,800
You might be right. This may be Kobol.

264
00:25:05,327 --> 00:25:09,320
<i>We should seriously consider
permanent settlement on this planet.</i>

265
00:25:09,527 --> 00:25:13,122
The scriptures tell us that
Kobol points the way to Earth.

266
00:25:14,287 --> 00:25:17,359
Organise a ground survey team.
Three Raptors.

267
00:25:18,007 --> 00:25:20,567
I want a complete survey
of the ruins immediately.

268
00:25:20,647 --> 00:25:22,000
Yes, sir.

269
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:23,679
You should go.

270
00:25:25,407 --> 00:25:29,525
Remember what I said, Gaius?
You don't want to be here when it happens.

271
00:25:29,607 --> 00:25:32,405
When what happens?
What would happen if I go?

272
00:25:33,607 --> 00:25:36,838
In fact, I think I'm going to volunteer
for the survey party.

273
00:25:36,927 --> 00:25:39,919
Your presence won't be necessary, Doctor.
Thank you.

274
00:25:40,007 --> 00:25:42,965
I'm the Vice President of the colony,
selected in my own right.

275
00:25:43,047 --> 00:25:46,357
And I feel that my presence on the planet
will be necessary, Commander.

276
00:25:46,447 --> 00:25:49,519
<i>As your chief science advisor,
I have to analyse the samples...</i>

277
00:25:49,607 --> 00:25:51,837
the team brings,
and it would be more efficient...

278
00:25:51,927 --> 00:25:53,679
if I can gather the samples by myself.

279
00:25:53,767 --> 00:25:56,645
Unless you have any objection,
Madam President.

280
00:25:56,727 --> 00:25:58,718
No objections. Thank you.

281
00:25:59,527 --> 00:26:01,119
We need to talk.

282
00:26:02,367 --> 00:26:03,482
Sure.

283
00:26:15,167 --> 00:26:16,441
You okay?

284
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:24,565
What do you think?

285
00:26:28,647 --> 00:26:32,242
I think it's hard to imagine
that you forgot to check the chamber.

286
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:39,439
I didn't forget.

287
00:26:46,687 --> 00:26:49,838
Sharon, what's going on?

288
00:26:51,087 --> 00:26:53,317
I know things
haven't been so great lately, but...

289
00:26:53,407 --> 00:26:55,523
I wake up in the morning...

290
00:26:55,767 --> 00:26:57,678
and I wonder who I am.

291
00:27:01,087 --> 00:27:04,318
I wake up and wonder
if I'm going to hurt someone.

292
00:27:06,087 --> 00:27:07,998
Sharon, you need help.

293
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:11,645
Not from you.

294
00:27:12,687 --> 00:27:14,564
You made that clear.

295
00:27:16,607 --> 00:27:18,962
I'm on my own.
No, you're not.

296
00:27:22,167 --> 00:27:24,362
Thanks for coming out, Chief.

297
00:27:25,807 --> 00:27:27,479
You're dismissed.

298
00:27:44,447 --> 00:27:46,563
So according to the scriptures...

299
00:27:46,647 --> 00:27:51,004
if we had the arrow of Apollo, we could
take it down to Kobol, and we could use it...

300
00:27:51,087 --> 00:27:54,875
to open the tomb of Athena
and find our way to Earth.

301
00:27:58,407 --> 00:28:00,796
I didn't know you were that religious.

302
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:02,366
Neither did I.

303
00:28:03,127 --> 00:28:05,641
Something wrong with that?
No.

304
00:28:07,607 --> 00:28:09,165
It's just new.

305
00:28:13,887 --> 00:28:17,004
There is no Earth. You understand that.

306
00:28:17,647 --> 00:28:20,002
It would seem that we were wrong.

307
00:28:21,287 --> 00:28:24,085
Commander, just because you and I
don't know where it is...

308
00:28:24,167 --> 00:28:26,601
it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

309
00:28:29,167 --> 00:28:30,805
Madam President...

310
00:28:31,207 --> 00:28:34,995
I am not trying to mock your faith,
so please understand me.

311
00:28:35,367 --> 00:28:39,326
These stories about Kobol, gods...

312
00:28:40,247 --> 00:28:42,203
the arrow of Apollo...

313
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:45,759
they're just stories, legends, myths.

314
00:28:47,807 --> 00:28:51,083
Don't let it blind you
to the reality that we face.

315
00:28:52,247 --> 00:28:56,604
Reality is that the Cylon Raider
has been successfully jump-tested.

316
00:28:57,287 --> 00:29:01,678
Reality is that Cylon technology
obviously outstrips our own.

317
00:29:02,047 --> 00:29:04,436
And reality is there is a good chance...

318
00:29:04,527 --> 00:29:08,122
the Raider can jump all the way back
to Caprica and retrieve that arrow...

319
00:29:08,207 --> 00:29:10,596
and find our way to Earth.

320
00:29:10,967 --> 00:29:14,039
The real Earth.
The Raider's a military asset.

321
00:29:14,327 --> 00:29:17,478
I won't use it to go chasing
some mythical arrow.

322
00:29:18,407 --> 00:29:19,760
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

323
00:29:22,607 --> 00:29:25,883
<i>I say we find Kobol,
count our blessings, and just stay there.</i>

324
00:29:25,967 --> 00:29:29,437
<i>But the sacred scrolls say
that this could guide us to Earth. Right?</i>

325
00:29:30,007 --> 00:29:33,397
<i>Okay. Cut the chatter. Raptors 2 and 3 on me.</i>

326
00:29:33,487 --> 00:29:37,480
FTL's spun up and ready?
Cally, hold onto your lunch.

327
00:29:37,967 --> 00:29:39,844
Jump in ten...

328
00:29:40,407 --> 00:29:42,443
<i>nine, eight...</i>

329
00:29:43,007 --> 00:29:46,283
<i>seven, six, five...</i>

330
00:29:46,927 --> 00:29:49,077
<i>four, three...</i>

331
00:29:49,647 --> 00:29:51,558
two, one.

332
00:29:56,487 --> 00:29:58,239
Jump complete, gentlemen.

333
00:29:58,327 --> 00:30:01,683
Bring the nose down,
we should see the planet directly ahead.

334
00:30:02,527 --> 00:30:04,324
What the hell is that?

335
00:30:04,567 --> 00:30:05,886
Oh, my God!

336
00:30:13,127 --> 00:30:15,277
Cartman! Get us out of here!

337
00:30:28,167 --> 00:30:30,840
We got a fire in the turbine.
Shutting it down!

338
00:30:33,047 --> 00:30:35,277
Put it down!

339
00:30:35,487 --> 00:30:37,557
Out of the way! Come on!

340
00:30:39,127 --> 00:30:40,924
Get out of the seat, Doc!

341
00:30:46,527 --> 00:30:48,245
Everybody hang on!

342
00:30:49,527 --> 00:30:50,801
Can you jump us out?

343
00:30:50,887 --> 00:30:52,957
No, the out drive's been hit.

344
00:30:53,047 --> 00:30:54,639
Socinus, get on the horn...

345
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:57,036
<i>and tell Raptor 2 to jump back to Galactica!</i>

346
00:30:57,127 --> 00:30:58,162
<i>Right now!</i>

347
00:30:58,247 --> 00:31:00,602
<i>Jump back to Galactica!</i>

348
00:31:06,567 --> 00:31:08,444
<i>Jump back to Galactica, over.</i>

349
00:31:10,847 --> 00:31:13,441
<i>You are ordered to jump back to Galactica.</i>

350
00:31:21,607 --> 00:31:24,246
Whenever they're within
proximity of one another...

351
00:31:24,327 --> 00:31:26,443
they send off a short IFF burst.

352
00:31:27,247 --> 00:31:29,158
Essentially, they are Cylon transponders...

353
00:31:29,247 --> 00:31:32,478
programmed to identify themselves
to any other Cylon transponder.

354
00:31:32,567 --> 00:31:35,684
- Damn nice work, Lieutenant.
- That's very good.

355
00:31:36,807 --> 00:31:39,799
Now that we know what they are,
I want to test one in the Raider.

356
00:31:39,887 --> 00:31:41,445
Draidus contact.

357
00:31:41,527 --> 00:31:43,483
Raptor 275, sir.

358
00:31:43,567 --> 00:31:45,000
Back early.

359
00:31:47,927 --> 00:31:49,565
Something's wrong.

360
00:31:52,847 --> 00:31:54,678
What the hell are you doing?

361
00:31:55,367 --> 00:31:57,642
Oh, God!
Hang on!

362
00:31:57,807 --> 00:31:59,479
God! Oh, my God!

363
00:32:04,207 --> 00:32:05,401
Do it!

364
00:32:05,487 --> 00:32:07,478
Everybody hit the deck!

365
00:32:15,807 --> 00:32:17,445
I can't see!

366
00:32:17,527 --> 00:32:20,166
Pull it up!

367
00:32:23,807 --> 00:32:24,956
Watch the hill!

368
00:32:25,047 --> 00:32:26,799
Thanks for watching!

369
00:32:31,567 --> 00:32:33,080
How many people did we lose?

370
00:32:33,167 --> 00:32:35,362
<i>Ten souls aboard Raptor 3.</i>

371
00:32:35,447 --> 00:32:37,756
<i>Raptor 1, last visual contact was seen...</i>

372
00:32:37,847 --> 00:32:40,486
under power flight
heading toward the surface.

373
00:32:40,567 --> 00:32:44,242
We need a way to take out the base ship
before we can attempt a rescue.

374
00:32:44,327 --> 00:32:46,045
Starbuck's working on a plan...

375
00:32:46,127 --> 00:32:49,642
using the captured Raider
to get a nuke into the base ship.

376
00:32:51,407 --> 00:32:53,796
- The Raider?
- When did this happen?

377
00:32:54,127 --> 00:32:55,355
About 19 minutes ago.

378
00:32:55,447 --> 00:32:59,326
She said she's working on the details
and we'll have a report at 1400.

379
00:32:59,407 --> 00:33:01,921
Go talk to Starbuck right away.
My pleasure.

380
00:33:02,007 --> 00:33:03,963
And report back to me.
Yes, sir.

381
00:33:04,047 --> 00:33:06,436
Is there something to worry about,
Madam President?

382
00:33:06,527 --> 00:33:07,642
Why do you ask that?

383
00:33:07,727 --> 00:33:10,116
- That look on your face.
- Not now.

384
00:33:10,607 --> 00:33:13,644
Take that out.
The Chief said we need it, but I don't.

385
00:33:13,727 --> 00:33:15,957
Lt. Thrace, attention!

386
00:33:17,007 --> 00:33:20,920
I gave you a command.
You will obey it. Attention!

387
00:33:24,887 --> 00:33:28,846
You do not take
your harebrained ideas to the XO...

388
00:33:28,927 --> 00:33:32,078
without going through me first.
Do you understand?

389
00:33:34,127 --> 00:33:35,446
Yes, sir.

390
00:33:41,807 --> 00:33:44,321
At ease. So what's the plan?

391
00:33:46,247 --> 00:33:50,286
I'm putting an autopilot in the Raider.
Jump him to the base ship.

392
00:33:50,567 --> 00:33:54,276
Engage the autopilot, punch out.
Get picked up by a Raptor.

393
00:33:54,367 --> 00:33:56,198
The Raider heads
to the base ship.

394
00:33:56,287 --> 00:33:59,199
Except the transponder
allows the Raider to approach.

395
00:33:59,407 --> 00:34:00,920
Nuke goes off.

396
00:34:01,967 --> 00:34:03,241
Boom, sir.

397
00:34:03,607 --> 00:34:06,360
Might work. Might get you killed.

398
00:34:07,767 --> 00:34:09,723
Would you miss me, sir?

399
00:34:11,527 --> 00:34:13,597
I need every pilot I have.

400
00:34:14,447 --> 00:34:16,199
Even the screw-ups.

401
00:34:21,327 --> 00:34:22,555
Captain.

402
00:34:25,927 --> 00:34:27,599
I'm really sorry.

403
00:34:34,847 --> 00:34:38,522
If you do this, it could threaten
everything we've accomplished.

404
00:34:38,607 --> 00:34:41,599
It may bring down the government
and you don't have a right...

405
00:34:41,687 --> 00:34:43,518
to risk that for a...

406
00:34:45,447 --> 00:34:46,562
Go on.

407
00:34:47,287 --> 00:34:49,847
For a drug-induced vision of prophecy.

408
00:34:50,167 --> 00:34:52,158
I am well aware of that.

409
00:34:53,287 --> 00:34:56,597
But it would seem that
the gods have a different plan.

410
00:34:57,007 --> 00:34:59,760
Would you please get me
Lt. Thrace?

411
00:35:02,327 --> 00:35:04,079
Can I get you some more water?

412
00:35:04,167 --> 00:35:05,805
Yes. Thanks.

413
00:35:12,167 --> 00:35:13,600
You can't be serious.

414
00:35:13,687 --> 00:35:16,963
All of this has happened before
and will happen again.

415
00:35:17,047 --> 00:35:20,323
That Cylon you interrogated,
he quoted that bit of scripture.

416
00:35:20,407 --> 00:35:22,875
He also said that we would find Kobol...

417
00:35:22,967 --> 00:35:25,879
and Kobol would show us the way,
did he not?

418
00:35:26,527 --> 00:35:27,721
Yes, he did.

419
00:35:27,807 --> 00:35:29,559
We have found Kobol.

420
00:35:30,647 --> 00:35:33,286
Do you believe in the gods, Lieutenant?

421
00:35:35,887 --> 00:35:39,880
Not that it's any of your business,
but, yes, I believe.

422
00:35:40,047 --> 00:35:44,040
Lieutenant, I am not trying to put you
on the defensive...

423
00:35:44,607 --> 00:35:47,724
I would like you
to think this through with me.

424
00:35:48,287 --> 00:35:50,437
If you believe in the gods...

425
00:35:50,727 --> 00:35:53,195
then you believe in the cycle of time...

426
00:35:53,287 --> 00:35:56,165
that we are all playing our parts in a story...

427
00:35:56,247 --> 00:36:00,365
that is told again and again
and again throughout eternity.

428
00:36:00,487 --> 00:36:01,966
That's the way I was raised.

429
00:36:02,047 --> 00:36:04,277
But that doesn't mean
that my part in the story...

430
00:36:04,367 --> 00:36:07,837
is to go off on some crazy-ass mission
against orders.

431
00:36:10,487 --> 00:36:14,799
May I tell you the part of the story
that it would seem I am playing?

432
00:36:17,447 --> 00:36:18,846
I am dying.

433
00:36:19,767 --> 00:36:22,839
- What?
- I have terminal breast cancer.

434
00:36:22,927 --> 00:36:26,966
I have six months at the outside to live,
and I have only told three people...

435
00:36:27,047 --> 00:36:30,198
so I'd appreciate it if you kept it to yourself.

436
00:36:30,527 --> 00:36:31,846
Of course.

437
00:36:32,367 --> 00:36:33,686
Are you saying that you are...

438
00:36:33,767 --> 00:36:36,679
The scripture tells us a dying leader...

439
00:36:36,767 --> 00:36:39,327
lead humanity to the promised land.

440
00:36:41,167 --> 00:36:44,443
If you go back to Caprica
and bring me the arrow...

441
00:36:45,527 --> 00:36:47,438
I will show us the way.

442
00:36:49,967 --> 00:36:51,559
This is crazy.

443
00:36:51,647 --> 00:36:55,606
People keep using that word.
It is crazy. Perhaps.

444
00:36:56,807 --> 00:36:59,367
That doesn't mean it isn't true.

445
00:37:01,247 --> 00:37:03,556
And it may be our only chance.

446
00:37:04,447 --> 00:37:06,199
Our only chance...

447
00:37:07,127 --> 00:37:08,606
to find Earth.

448
00:37:08,687 --> 00:37:11,247
The old man is our last chance to find Earth.

449
00:37:11,327 --> 00:37:14,478
He knows where it is. He said so.
You were there.

450
00:37:14,727 --> 00:37:18,356
The location is a secret.
But he is going to take us there.

451
00:37:29,727 --> 00:37:32,844
Commander Adama has no idea...

452
00:37:33,367 --> 00:37:35,961
where Earth is. He never did.

453
00:37:36,047 --> 00:37:39,722
He made it up in order to give people hope.

454
00:37:44,647 --> 00:37:46,683
- You're lying.
- Go ask him.

455
00:37:48,047 --> 00:37:49,366
I will.

456
00:37:59,687 --> 00:38:01,484
I need one more in-flight test...

457
00:38:01,567 --> 00:38:04,957
for the autopilot and NAV systems
before I jump for Kobol.

458
00:38:05,047 --> 00:38:06,241
Right.

459
00:38:08,407 --> 00:38:10,682
Can I ask you a question, boss?

460
00:38:10,967 --> 00:38:12,241
Shoot.

461
00:38:14,687 --> 00:38:17,247
How much longer till we reach Earth?

462
00:38:20,487 --> 00:38:22,159
It's hard to say.

463
00:38:23,687 --> 00:38:25,359
You got a guess?

464
00:38:27,887 --> 00:38:30,162
You know I don't like to guess.

465
00:38:32,647 --> 00:38:34,478
Are we getting closer?

466
00:38:37,927 --> 00:38:39,599
I'm sure we are.

467
00:38:40,247 --> 00:38:42,158
Good luck on the next test.

468
00:38:57,487 --> 00:39:00,001
Apollo. Starbuck. I'm ready over here.

469
00:39:06,567 --> 00:39:08,683
Okay, Starbuck. The board is green.

470
00:39:12,007 --> 00:39:13,281
Copy that.

471
00:39:14,127 --> 00:39:16,516
Powering up for the autopilot test.

472
00:39:21,607 --> 00:39:24,758
<i>This is Starbuck, request permission
to speak with Galactica actual.</i>

473
00:39:26,007 --> 00:39:28,316
Starbuck wants to speak to you, sir.

474
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:30,762
She's on a scrambled channel.

475
00:39:38,287 --> 00:39:39,561
Go ahead.

476
00:39:41,647 --> 00:39:45,196
I believed you. Believed in Earth.

477
00:39:46,007 --> 00:39:47,645
What are you doing, Starbuck?

478
00:39:48,727 --> 00:39:50,080
Bringing home the CAG, sir.

479
00:39:51,727 --> 00:39:53,638
We can talk about this.

480
00:39:54,527 --> 00:39:56,324
No, I don't think so.

481
00:39:57,607 --> 00:40:02,044
I want you to remember one thing.
I do not regret anything that I did.

482
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:08,038
<i>Be sure that whatever you're going to do,
you don't regret it later.</i>

483
00:40:08,527 --> 00:40:10,324
Do you understand me?

484
00:40:12,567 --> 00:40:14,444
I guess we'll find out.

485
00:40:20,367 --> 00:40:23,279
Commander, she's spinning up
the Raider's FTL drive.

486
00:40:23,367 --> 00:40:24,766
What?

487
00:40:25,207 --> 00:40:27,880
This is an autopilot test,
what the hell is she doing?

488
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,639
What are you doing, Kara?

489
00:40:35,127 --> 00:40:37,197
<i>Galactica. Apollo. She just jumped away.</i>

490
00:40:37,287 --> 00:40:40,643
Repeat. Starbuck and the Raider
just jumped away.

491
00:40:44,527 --> 00:40:48,520
She wasn't scheduled for a jump test.
Where the hell did she go?

492
00:40:52,607 --> 00:40:53,722
Home.
