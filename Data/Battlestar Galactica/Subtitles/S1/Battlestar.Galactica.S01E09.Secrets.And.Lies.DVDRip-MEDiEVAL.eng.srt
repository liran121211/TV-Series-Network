1
00:00:02,687 --> 00:00:04,837
<i>Previously on
Battlestar Galactica...</i>

2
00:00:35,487 --> 00:00:37,045
I notice you're calling her Sharon now.

3
00:00:37,127 --> 00:00:39,322
She acts like them, thinks like them.

4
00:00:39,407 --> 00:00:41,523
She's one of them.
But she's one of us.

5
00:00:41,607 --> 00:00:44,917
We gotta go, now.
We gotta travel fast. Even faster than before.

6
00:00:48,647 --> 00:00:50,603
<i>They found him
in the storage compartment.</i>

7
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:53,606
He's another copy of the Cylon
you know as Leoben.

8
00:00:53,807 --> 00:00:58,039
I'll send a team over to destroy it.
Anything it says cannot be trusted.

9
00:00:58,127 --> 00:01:00,721
- Don't!
- Adama is a Cylon.

10
00:01:41,487 --> 00:01:44,126
Commander? Here's Dr. Baltar's report.

11
00:01:44,647 --> 00:01:47,957
And the President is waiting for you
up in the core.

12
00:01:48,447 --> 00:01:49,766
Thank you.

13
00:02:13,527 --> 00:02:15,040
Clear the deck.

14
00:02:18,447 --> 00:02:20,722
Madame President,
we are the proud owners...

15
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:24,004
of the universe's first,
bona-fide Cylon detector.

16
00:02:25,007 --> 00:02:26,725
That is great news.

17
00:02:28,727 --> 00:02:29,876
Yeah.

18
00:02:31,447 --> 00:02:33,244
So, when do we begin?

19
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:36,877
Dr. Baltar would like to start
widespread testing as soon as possible...

20
00:02:36,967 --> 00:02:40,118
but there are some serious limitations.

21
00:02:40,287 --> 00:02:44,360
He can only do one person at a time,
and verification takes hours.

22
00:02:45,687 --> 00:02:47,757
So who's going to go first?

23
00:02:51,687 --> 00:02:53,325
The tests. Right.

24
00:02:55,527 --> 00:02:58,246
I think people in sensitive positions
should go first.

25
00:02:58,327 --> 00:03:00,966
I completely agree. How about you?

26
00:03:03,887 --> 00:03:05,206
Excuse me?

27
00:03:05,687 --> 00:03:09,077
If you're a Cylon, I'd like to know.

28
00:03:09,407 --> 00:03:11,841
If I'm a Cylon, you're really screwed.

29
00:03:14,487 --> 00:03:18,275
Seriously, I do think that you should go first.

30
00:03:18,847 --> 00:03:22,157
Show everyone in the fleet
that they can trust the people at the top.

31
00:03:22,247 --> 00:03:24,556
Then maybe you should go first.

32
00:03:30,727 --> 00:03:35,005
All right, I'll go first.

33
00:03:35,567 --> 00:03:38,320
I think that's good. I do.

34
00:03:50,407 --> 00:03:51,920
<i>Bank on my advice.</i>

35
00:03:59,327 --> 00:04:02,797
- They always do that?
- No, they're just showing off.

36
00:04:03,247 --> 00:04:05,078
They know I'm in here.

37
00:04:06,927 --> 00:04:10,715
You date a special assistant
to the President, word gets out.

38
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:13,925
So this is officially a date?

39
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,685
Jury's still out.

40
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,440
<i>Observation deck
has two minutes remaining.</i>

41
00:04:25,127 --> 00:04:26,526
You could pull rank.

42
00:04:26,607 --> 00:04:30,395
You could tell them you're on special
business for the President of the Colonies.

43
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:33,365
Your boss pulls more weight around here
than mine.

44
00:04:33,447 --> 00:04:38,396
- You can tell them Adama wants you to...
- Yeah, what? Wants me to what?

45
00:04:42,727 --> 00:04:44,957
I lost my train of thought.

46
00:05:03,807 --> 00:05:06,196
How is he these days, by the way?

47
00:05:06,767 --> 00:05:11,716
- The old man? He's fine, I guess.
- You guess?

48
00:05:12,967 --> 00:05:17,358
He's been acting kind of funny lately.
Seems distracted or something.

49
00:05:18,727 --> 00:05:23,039
He's been making all these weird calls
from his quarters. Super secret.

50
00:05:23,527 --> 00:05:27,759
- Probably a security thing.
- They don't want me to log the calls, though.

51
00:05:28,087 --> 00:05:29,998
No trace file. Nothing.

52
00:05:31,167 --> 00:05:33,840
- And this just started?
- A few days ago.

53
00:05:38,287 --> 00:05:42,838
Billy Keikeya, are you pumping me
for information about the old man?

54
00:05:43,567 --> 00:05:44,886
Time's up.

55
00:05:47,687 --> 00:05:50,440
- No. Of course not.
- You are.

56
00:05:50,647 --> 00:05:55,357
- You are. You're a spy, that's what you are.
- I was just asking a couple of questions.

57
00:05:55,447 --> 00:05:57,642
I hope you liked the answers.

58
00:05:58,687 --> 00:06:02,965
Because they're the last ones
you're gonna get for a while.

59
00:06:06,927 --> 00:06:08,645
What did you find out?

60
00:06:08,727 --> 00:06:10,797
Dualla couldn't put her finger on it...

61
00:06:10,887 --> 00:06:13,720
but, yeah, she said
he's been acting differently.

62
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:18,483
I could see that myself. He was distracted
and unfocused. What else?

63
00:06:20,287 --> 00:06:23,245
Some scrambled wireless calls
he didn't want logged.

64
00:06:23,327 --> 00:06:28,117
She didn't know who he called or why.
But none of this is damning evidence.

65
00:06:28,407 --> 00:06:30,238
The calls could be security-related...

66
00:06:30,327 --> 00:06:33,797
and his odd behaviour could be stress,
pure and simple.

67
00:06:34,167 --> 00:06:38,319
- Exhaustion, paranoia...
- All right. It could be any of those things.

68
00:06:38,767 --> 00:06:40,564
But what if it's not?

69
00:06:44,287 --> 00:06:47,085
Madame President, with all due respect...

70
00:06:47,887 --> 00:06:51,277
I cannot believe we're actually
entertaining the idea...

71
00:06:51,367 --> 00:06:53,323
that Commander Adama...

72
00:06:53,407 --> 00:06:57,639
has been somehow replaced
by a Cylon duplicate.

73
00:07:01,127 --> 00:07:02,924
Oh, my gods, Billy...

74
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,759
I hope you're right.

75
00:08:18,127 --> 00:08:20,083
Is suicide really a sin?

76
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:27,157
A mortal one, I'm afraid.
But it's not that bad, is it, Gaius?

77
00:08:29,607 --> 00:08:32,997
47,905 people in the fleet.

78
00:08:34,527 --> 00:08:39,442
47,905 blood samples.

79
00:08:40,607 --> 00:08:44,839
Eleven hours to test each one
for Cylon indicators.

80
00:08:45,127 --> 00:08:46,879
That'll take awhile.

81
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:51,725
21,956 days.

82
00:08:52,447 --> 00:08:55,598
60.1534 years.

83
00:08:56,007 --> 00:08:58,726
Now, let's figure in a few hours
to sleep here and there.

84
00:08:58,807 --> 00:09:02,482
We'll call it an even 61, shall we?
Sure.

85
00:09:03,807 --> 00:09:05,763
I prefer to kill myself.

86
00:09:12,007 --> 00:09:15,886
Commander Adama, are you a Cylon?

87
00:09:19,247 --> 00:09:20,885
Tune in tomorrow.

88
00:09:21,367 --> 00:09:25,201
It's hard being a genius.
Yes.

89
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:29,125
There should be some perks.
Yes.

90
00:10:27,047 --> 00:10:28,560
What's up, Doc?

91
00:10:32,207 --> 00:10:35,358
Lt. Thrace, good to see you. I was just...

92
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:39,321
keeping up with the old exercises.

93
00:10:42,367 --> 00:10:45,120
That should do me for today.

94
00:10:46,967 --> 00:10:48,082
I feel all better.

95
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:51,557
What brings you to the lab
at this time of the night?

96
00:10:51,847 --> 00:10:53,917
It's mid-afternoon.
Yeah, it is.

97
00:10:54,007 --> 00:10:57,204
Crazy workload. I totally lose track of time.

98
00:10:57,287 --> 00:10:59,323
So, what can I do for you?

99
00:11:00,047 --> 00:11:02,003
You can zip up your fly.

100
00:11:05,687 --> 00:11:07,917
- So...
- My blood test.

101
00:11:09,087 --> 00:11:11,601
You're right about one thing, Gaius.

102
00:11:11,687 --> 00:11:14,645
There is something very intriguing about her.

103
00:11:16,527 --> 00:11:19,724
Very good. Very good.

104
00:11:47,127 --> 00:11:49,118
At least I did that much.

105
00:12:24,127 --> 00:12:25,719
Dradis, contact!

106
00:12:25,807 --> 00:12:29,402
<i>- Cylon Raider bearing 738 carom 005.
- Galactica, Apollo.</i>

107
00:12:29,487 --> 00:12:32,320
- Action stations.
- Cylon Raider bearing 738 carom 005.

108
00:12:32,407 --> 00:12:35,126
- Relative zero.
- Close with enemy, destroy. Acknowledge.

109
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:37,678
<i>We're on it, Galactica.</i>

110
00:12:38,287 --> 00:12:40,960
He jumped right in front of us. His mistake.

111
00:12:44,527 --> 00:12:47,166
- How many?
- Single Raider. Looks like a recon patrol.

112
00:12:47,247 --> 00:12:49,078
Apollo and Beehive have them in their sight.

113
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:51,397
Where's the old man?
He's not aboard.

114
00:12:51,487 --> 00:12:55,321
- Not aboard? Where the hell is he?
- He left in a Raptor about an hour ago.

115
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:57,398
No flight plan.
No flight plan?

116
00:12:57,487 --> 00:13:00,285
That's it.
You set him up, I'll knock him down.

117
00:13:11,487 --> 00:13:14,684
<i>I winged him.
Looks like I got his weapon systems.</i>

118
00:13:15,567 --> 00:13:16,636
He jumped.

119
00:13:17,007 --> 00:13:19,521
<i>He jumped away before
we could zero him out.</i>

120
00:13:19,607 --> 00:13:24,123
Damn it. Probably giving away our position
to every Cylon base ship right now.

121
00:13:24,207 --> 00:13:26,596
Where in the hell is the old man?

122
00:13:28,887 --> 00:13:31,720
Order the fleet
to execute emergency jump procedures.

123
00:13:31,807 --> 00:13:34,037
Everyone rendezvous
at the stand-by coordinates.

124
00:13:34,127 --> 00:13:35,196
Contact!

125
00:13:35,287 --> 00:13:39,997
Single Raider bearing 881 carom 247.

126
00:13:40,447 --> 00:13:45,316
<i>Apollo, Galactica,
Cylon Raider detected at 881 carom 24...</i>

127
00:13:45,967 --> 00:13:49,516
<i>Wait, I see him! Same Raider.
What?</i>

128
00:13:49,607 --> 00:13:52,246
It's the same Raider.
I can see the damage from before.

129
00:13:55,807 --> 00:13:57,843
<i>It's behaving erratically.</i>

130
00:14:00,127 --> 00:14:01,924
<i>He jumped away again.</i>

131
00:14:02,727 --> 00:14:05,719
Contact. Single Raider, same telltales.

132
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:12,723
- It's like he's just flying around in circles.
- Wounded bird. Can't fly home.

133
00:14:13,487 --> 00:14:16,843
<i>Galactica. We got him
on Dradis, but he's pretty far out there.</i>

134
00:14:16,927 --> 00:14:19,282
<i>Take us three minutes
to close to weapons range.</i>

135
00:14:19,367 --> 00:14:22,916
No. This is our perfect chance
to get some intel.

136
00:14:23,567 --> 00:14:26,843
Order Apollo to close with the Raider,
but do not engage.

137
00:14:26,927 --> 00:14:28,883
Put a Raptor in the air.

138
00:14:28,967 --> 00:14:31,003
As long as that's flopping around out there...

139
00:14:31,087 --> 00:14:34,477
tell them I want to suck in
every electronic signal it makes.

140
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:37,963
Sir. Colonel, Commander Adama's Raptor
is requesting permission...

141
00:14:38,047 --> 00:14:41,323
to enter the landing pattern.
Permission granted.

142
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:44,840
Stand down to Condition Two.
Permission granted.

143
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:47,122
Mr. Gaeta, you have the deck.

144
00:15:24,767 --> 00:15:26,723
Permission to come aboard?
Granted.

145
00:15:26,807 --> 00:15:29,719
Mind telling me
where the hell you've been?

146
00:15:29,807 --> 00:15:33,004
Col. Tigh, allow me to present your wife.

147
00:15:39,327 --> 00:15:40,476
Ellen?

148
00:16:06,887 --> 00:16:09,526
That noise. I don't get it.

149
00:16:09,607 --> 00:16:13,805
I've blown Centurions away before.
They've never sent an entire army after me.

150
00:16:14,047 --> 00:16:16,515
They're after me.
Why you?

151
00:16:17,767 --> 00:16:20,520
While they were holding me,
I overheard some things.

152
00:16:20,607 --> 00:16:22,837
What?
Plans. Deployments.

153
00:16:23,367 --> 00:16:26,245
There's a big Cylon base at Delphi.
A major hub.

154
00:16:26,327 --> 00:16:29,125
Delphi? Frakking bastards.

155
00:16:29,207 --> 00:16:33,598
The best place to try and grab
a ship and get off this frakking planet.

156
00:16:45,767 --> 00:16:48,235
Dr. Gaius Baltar,
Department of Cylon Detection...

157
00:16:48,327 --> 00:16:50,363
how may I direct your call?

158
00:16:50,447 --> 00:16:53,519
<i>You're in a good mood.
Madame President...</i>

159
00:16:55,927 --> 00:16:59,476
I'm sorry. I was expecting someone else.
We haven't spoken in ages.

160
00:16:59,567 --> 00:17:03,242
Doctor, I'd like you to call me the moment
Commander Adama's test is complete.

161
00:17:03,327 --> 00:17:04,362
Will you do that?

162
00:17:04,447 --> 00:17:07,757
Commander Adama cancelled his test
a short time ago.

163
00:17:09,287 --> 00:17:11,881
- Why?
- I don't know.

164
00:17:11,967 --> 00:17:15,084
He gave me another sample.
He said it had priority.

165
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,203
- Whose?
- I'll just check.

166
00:17:20,447 --> 00:17:24,725
Some woman called Ellen.
No surname. He dropped it off and left.

167
00:17:24,807 --> 00:17:26,126
Is there a problem?

168
00:17:26,207 --> 00:17:28,767
Dr. Baltar, I would like
you to resume testing...

169
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:32,283
Commander Adama's blood sample
immediately. Thank you.

170
00:17:37,047 --> 00:17:41,165
- I can't believe you're alive.
- I can't believe it myself.

171
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:48,276
Saul, I don't remember the last few weeks.

172
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:50,878
It's weeks, right?
Right.

173
00:17:50,967 --> 00:17:53,242
<i>You've been on the Rising Star all this time?</i>

174
00:17:53,327 --> 00:17:54,680
I guess so.

175
00:17:55,327 --> 00:17:58,683
The last thing I remember is being on Picon.

176
00:17:59,247 --> 00:18:01,636
I was at the airport buying a ticket home...

177
00:18:01,727 --> 00:18:05,003
and hearing something about the Cylons.

178
00:18:05,407 --> 00:18:09,366
And then just dreams, mostly dreams...

179
00:18:10,887 --> 00:18:12,843
until a couple days ago.

180
00:18:14,087 --> 00:18:18,239
They tell me I was knocked out
when the Cylons attacked the airport.

181
00:18:18,887 --> 00:18:22,004
And someone just picked me up...

182
00:18:23,447 --> 00:18:25,881
and put me on the last flight out.

183
00:18:29,127 --> 00:18:32,403
Some saviour. I don't even know who.

184
00:18:33,207 --> 00:18:36,517
It's all right. You're here now.

185
00:18:40,967 --> 00:18:42,798
It's like we found
a treasure chest.

186
00:18:42,887 --> 00:18:44,764
One of the major issues we've been having...

187
00:18:44,847 --> 00:18:48,157
with the Raider we captured
is to figure the faster-than-light drive.

188
00:18:48,247 --> 00:18:51,478
This wounded bird is jumping
all over the place out there.

189
00:18:51,567 --> 00:18:56,083
Yeah. And every time it jumps,
it gives us more data that we can use.

190
00:18:56,607 --> 00:19:00,043
But what was it doing out there,
and how long can it keep it up?

191
00:19:00,127 --> 00:19:03,642
The moment you have your FTL data,
give me an update.

192
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:06,958
Let's not let this thing linger out there
longer than we have to.

193
00:19:07,047 --> 00:19:08,446
Yes, sir.

194
00:19:08,527 --> 00:19:12,315
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- Stay on it.

195
00:19:19,607 --> 00:19:21,438
You have dinner plans?

196
00:19:22,207 --> 00:19:25,119
- What?
- Come on.

197
00:19:27,607 --> 00:19:31,236
I never thought I'd see you again.
Me neither.

198
00:19:33,967 --> 00:19:37,164
The things I said before, the things I did...

199
00:19:37,727 --> 00:19:40,366
In the past? It's all in the past.

200
00:19:42,127 --> 00:19:46,086
- Start over?
- Start over.

201
00:19:59,367 --> 00:20:02,518
- I... I can't.
- Forget it...

202
00:20:03,527 --> 00:20:07,076
I can't. I'm on duty.

203
00:20:16,407 --> 00:20:19,126
XO. Now?

204
00:20:20,727 --> 00:20:24,686
Understood. All right. Tell her I'm on my way.

205
00:20:25,927 --> 00:20:27,280
Girlfriend?

206
00:20:28,447 --> 00:20:32,406
- Official business.
- Feels like old times.

207
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:35,917
- I'd explain, but...
- It's classified.

208
00:20:37,087 --> 00:20:39,317
I'll be back as soon as I can.

209
00:20:45,767 --> 00:20:48,600
I'll be here, waiting.

210
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,845
As soon as I can.

211
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:05,156
You want to be very, very careful
with what you just said.

212
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:09,595
<i>You're talking about a man I owe my life to,
many times over.</i>

213
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:12,484
I know these are uncertain times...

214
00:21:12,567 --> 00:21:15,035
and this has been
a difficult transition for you.

215
00:21:15,127 --> 00:21:17,038
Excuse me, Colonel.

216
00:21:17,967 --> 00:21:21,846
<i>I do appreciate how difficult this is
for you to hear, believe me.</i>

217
00:21:21,927 --> 00:21:26,443
But I would advise you right now
not to say anything that you will regret.

218
00:21:34,767 --> 00:21:38,203
I need to know if you have seen
anything suspicious...

219
00:21:38,287 --> 00:21:40,596
- about his recent behaviour?
- No.

220
00:21:42,647 --> 00:21:44,842
<i>What about the fact
that he left the Galactica...</i>

221
00:21:44,927 --> 00:21:48,806
without telling anyone where he was going
or when he would return...

222
00:21:48,887 --> 00:21:53,642
and at that very moment,
a Cylon Raider jumped into view...

223
00:21:54,087 --> 00:21:57,682
- and started acting strangely?
- I know exactly where he was.

224
00:21:57,767 --> 00:22:00,645
You do?
He was picking up my wife.

225
00:22:05,047 --> 00:22:06,366
Your wife?

226
00:22:06,927 --> 00:22:11,637
<i>Turns out she's been unconscious
aboard the Rising Star ever since the attack.</i>

227
00:22:11,807 --> 00:22:13,160
Oh, my gods!

228
00:22:13,687 --> 00:22:16,918
That's fantastic. That's amazing.
Yes, it is.

229
00:22:17,487 --> 00:22:21,799
When Ellen stepped off that shuttle,
I thought I was going to pass out.

230
00:22:22,687 --> 00:22:23,836
Ellen?

231
00:22:26,327 --> 00:22:29,000
- Your wife's name is Ellen?
- Yes, it is.

232
00:22:29,167 --> 00:22:31,727
Ellen. Ellen Tigh.

233
00:22:33,287 --> 00:22:36,836
I'd very much like to meet your wife, Colonel.

234
00:22:37,527 --> 00:22:39,518
Resume the test on Ellen?

235
00:22:41,847 --> 00:22:45,123
No, it's no trouble at all.

236
00:22:52,047 --> 00:22:53,196
Ellen?

237
00:22:54,967 --> 00:22:57,037
- Did you shut the door?
- I already did.

238
00:23:01,207 --> 00:23:05,120
- Surprise.
- Ambrosia? Where did you get this?

239
00:23:05,207 --> 00:23:07,641
I have my ways.

240
00:23:08,327 --> 00:23:12,161
I thought it might be just the thing
for a little celebration.

241
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:19,759
- We need to talk.
- First things first.

242
00:23:23,367 --> 00:23:24,516
There.

243
00:23:26,367 --> 00:23:28,756
- Starting over.
- Starting over.

244
00:23:33,767 --> 00:23:38,124
- I'm technically still on duty.
- I think they can do without you for a day.

245
00:23:38,207 --> 00:23:40,516
It doesn't really work that way.

246
00:24:03,767 --> 00:24:06,201
Starting over.

247
00:24:22,247 --> 00:24:26,081
Sure, there's whining and complaining
like you would expect...

248
00:24:26,487 --> 00:24:30,765
but the people I talked to
are mostly hopeful and optimistic.

249
00:24:30,847 --> 00:24:32,599
That's good to hear.

250
00:24:35,167 --> 00:24:38,398
There are a few people
who still might wonder...

251
00:24:38,487 --> 00:24:41,957
if a kindergarten teacher
is really the right person to be President...

252
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:44,436
but they're just a tiny minority.

253
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:47,203
Wonderful.

254
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:52,356
<i>Everyone is so truly grateful
to all of you on Galactica.</i>

255
00:24:53,647 --> 00:24:57,526
- You literally are our saviours.
- We're just doing our jobs.

256
00:24:57,847 --> 00:24:59,519
You are so modest.

257
00:25:01,047 --> 00:25:02,639
He's always been that way.

258
00:25:05,807 --> 00:25:09,959
Lee, could I trouble you
for a little more of this lovely Ambrosia?

259
00:25:11,727 --> 00:25:13,638
- Sure.
- Thank you, dear.

260
00:25:14,047 --> 00:25:16,766
Bill, you must be so proud of your sons.

261
00:25:16,847 --> 00:25:20,123
Lee here has grown
into such a handsome man.

262
00:25:21,327 --> 00:25:24,364
I can only imagine
what Zak must look like now.

263
00:25:25,247 --> 00:25:28,364
You are the spitting image of your mother...

264
00:25:28,447 --> 00:25:32,565
and I bet Zak takes just after his daddy.

265
00:25:33,327 --> 00:25:35,966
Zak passed away
a couple of years ago.

266
00:25:38,847 --> 00:25:43,398
I'm sorry. How tragic, the death of a child.

267
00:25:44,967 --> 00:25:48,323
There's been so much death, so much pain.

268
00:25:53,007 --> 00:25:55,680
Sometimes it's completely overwhelming.

269
00:25:59,487 --> 00:26:01,796
I'm sure he was a beautiful boy.

270
00:26:06,207 --> 00:26:10,758
<i>The Captain of the Rising Star
was puzzled as to how you got on his ship.</i>

271
00:26:10,847 --> 00:26:14,601
I know. I know some thoughtful soul
just rescued me...

272
00:26:14,687 --> 00:26:19,556
from almost certain death,
and put me on the last flight out of Picon.

273
00:26:20,047 --> 00:26:22,607
- How lucky for us all.
- Yes, indeed.

274
00:26:22,687 --> 00:26:25,485
The strange thing is no one can recall...

275
00:26:25,607 --> 00:26:28,565
giving you any medical assistance
until about a week ago.

276
00:26:28,647 --> 00:26:30,877
I know.

277
00:26:32,767 --> 00:26:34,758
It's a miracle I'm alive.

278
00:26:37,047 --> 00:26:40,403
I think I better clear
some of these dishes.

279
00:26:41,247 --> 00:26:44,956
- You are so sweet.
- Very good. My compliments to the chef.

280
00:26:45,607 --> 00:26:49,043
So, Bill, now the question
on everyone's mind...

281
00:26:49,647 --> 00:26:51,205
and I do mean everyone...

282
00:26:51,287 --> 00:26:52,686
Sorry.
It's okay.

283
00:26:54,567 --> 00:26:58,719
...is where is Earth
and when do we get there?

284
00:27:01,047 --> 00:27:05,404
- That's classified information.
- That word again.

285
00:27:05,487 --> 00:27:06,522
Leave the man alone.

286
00:27:06,607 --> 00:27:09,883
Come on, if there are no privileges
of being an XO's wife...

287
00:27:09,967 --> 00:27:11,685
then what's the point?

288
00:27:11,767 --> 00:27:14,600
Bill, we're all family here. Come on.

289
00:27:15,007 --> 00:27:17,805
The need for secrecy is paramount, Ellen.

290
00:27:19,327 --> 00:27:23,445
I'm sorry. Perhaps you don't know
that the Cylons look like us now.

291
00:27:24,287 --> 00:27:27,165
That, yes, I knew that.

292
00:27:27,407 --> 00:27:31,366
It's recent news.
Most people found out a few days ago.

293
00:27:36,927 --> 00:27:39,964
A thing like that would travel fast. Right?

294
00:27:41,207 --> 00:27:43,482
Any one of us could be a Cylon.

295
00:27:50,647 --> 00:27:51,762
Boo!

296
00:27:55,647 --> 00:27:58,241
Did you see the looks on their faces?

297
00:27:59,167 --> 00:28:03,479
- You are too easy.
- Thank you so much for coming.

298
00:28:05,967 --> 00:28:08,197
It's been a wonderful evening.

299
00:28:11,967 --> 00:28:14,037
Thought it would never end.

300
00:28:15,207 --> 00:28:18,961
I seemed to have lost one of my shoes.

301
00:28:19,047 --> 00:28:22,198
- I think it's right here.
- Thank you.

302
00:28:23,527 --> 00:28:24,562
Here we are.

303
00:28:24,647 --> 00:28:27,605
- You look very, very happy.
- That's because I am very happy.

304
00:28:27,687 --> 00:28:29,006
Thank you.

305
00:28:33,847 --> 00:28:38,716
- It was nice to see you again.
- The pleasure's all mine.

306
00:28:39,727 --> 00:28:42,844
- Hope to see you soon.
- I'm sure you will.

307
00:28:50,287 --> 00:28:51,959
Hang on.

308
00:28:55,047 --> 00:28:56,196
Watch your step.

309
00:28:56,287 --> 00:28:57,606
- Good night.
- Lovely dinner.

310
00:28:57,687 --> 00:29:00,485
I've got her.
Be careful.

311
00:29:07,327 --> 00:29:10,125
You actually think that woman is a Cylon?

312
00:29:10,487 --> 00:29:13,684
If she's not, then we're all in a lot of trouble.

313
00:29:15,727 --> 00:29:18,685
When did Bill become
such a stick-in-the-mud?

314
00:29:19,487 --> 00:29:21,239
The man's a carving.

315
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:25,480
He's one of those faces on a totem pole.

316
00:29:28,287 --> 00:29:32,280
She slept with more than half the fleet,
while Saul was in space.

317
00:29:32,567 --> 00:29:34,398
Why the hell did he stay married to her?

318
00:29:34,487 --> 00:29:37,923
- It's obvious. He loves her deeply.
- Blindly.

319
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:41,280
Ellen used to encourage
the worst instincts in this guy...

320
00:29:41,367 --> 00:29:45,121
- bring out this self-destructive streak in him.
- Used to?

321
00:29:52,487 --> 00:29:55,206
Sharon, stop! I can't keep up.

322
00:30:09,847 --> 00:30:12,839
Helo, come on.

323
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:17,483
You can do it. Please.

324
00:30:19,007 --> 00:30:20,440
You have to get up.

325
00:30:24,967 --> 00:30:26,685
There. Right there.

326
00:30:53,567 --> 00:30:55,319
Turn your light off.

327
00:31:19,287 --> 00:31:22,006
We gotta find another way out of here.
We're going.

328
00:31:22,087 --> 00:31:25,238
Why aren't you waiting?
You keep going and going.

329
00:31:25,327 --> 00:31:27,966
- You never get tired.
- It's adrenaline.

330
00:31:28,727 --> 00:31:32,322
I'm not gonna die here.
And I'm not gonna let you die here either.

331
00:31:32,407 --> 00:31:34,159
Okay, let's go!

332
00:31:43,047 --> 00:31:46,039
Don't worry, I'll get us home.
Yeah, right.

333
00:31:46,567 --> 00:31:50,321
- Just like Bill's getting us to Earth.
- Don't start on Bill.

334
00:31:53,687 --> 00:31:57,157
He doesn't have the slightest idea
where Earth is.

335
00:31:57,247 --> 00:32:00,444
You don't have to yell it through the halls.

336
00:32:01,047 --> 00:32:04,676
Bill Adama doesn't know where Earth is!

337
00:32:05,047 --> 00:32:07,083
- Colonel.
- Doctor.

338
00:32:09,927 --> 00:32:13,886
Actually, I don't believe
I've had the pleasure.

339
00:32:14,247 --> 00:32:18,001
- I'm Dr. Gaius...
- Baltar. I know exactly who you are.

340
00:32:19,567 --> 00:32:21,717
And the pleasure's all mine.

341
00:32:25,127 --> 00:32:27,277
Something here, isn't there?

342
00:32:27,767 --> 00:32:30,281
You're still holding my hand.
That's funny.

343
00:32:30,367 --> 00:32:32,835
I thought you were still holding onto mine.

344
00:32:32,927 --> 00:32:35,487
I'm watching you. Both of you.

345
00:32:35,727 --> 00:32:38,116
And you should be watching her.

346
00:32:40,367 --> 00:32:43,040
Care to join us for a nightcap, Doctor?

347
00:32:44,407 --> 00:32:45,806
I'd love to.

348
00:32:45,887 --> 00:32:49,516
<i>Dr. Baltar,
report to the lab. The Commander is waiting.</i>

349
00:32:49,607 --> 00:32:53,839
- But I can't. Another time, perhaps.
- Count on it.

350
00:32:55,447 --> 00:32:56,596
Ta-ta!

351
00:32:59,887 --> 00:33:04,085
- Oh, Saulie, are you jealous?
- You said we were starting over.

352
00:33:04,407 --> 00:33:08,639
We are, sweetheart, we are.
That was just a little harmless flirting.

353
00:33:15,447 --> 00:33:17,836
You should know something.
What?

354
00:33:19,287 --> 00:33:21,323
In the middle of dinner...

355
00:33:23,687 --> 00:33:27,999
- Bill put his hand on my leg.
- Ellen, I'm not falling for this.

356
00:33:31,527 --> 00:33:36,123
<i>Did you know he came to see me
on the Rising Star?</i>

357
00:33:37,287 --> 00:33:38,322
What?

358
00:33:38,407 --> 00:33:41,922
He'd come into my room.
I'd pretend to be asleep.

359
00:33:43,167 --> 00:33:45,806
Then he'd sit by the side of my bed...

360
00:33:47,367 --> 00:33:51,280
- and then he'd touch me.
- Why are you doing this? You're lying.

361
00:33:53,487 --> 00:33:56,843
I am not. He was on that ship.

362
00:33:57,847 --> 00:33:59,565
I'll prove it.

363
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:03,635
Come on!

364
00:34:06,927 --> 00:34:09,043
Look, it's not magic. It's science.

365
00:34:09,127 --> 00:34:11,357
If you want the right result,
you have to wait awhile.

366
00:34:11,447 --> 00:34:12,960
I gave you her sample this morning.

367
00:34:13,047 --> 00:34:15,800
I have started and stopped
the test twice already now...

368
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,206
so I'm running a little behind.

369
00:34:17,287 --> 00:34:19,437
- Twice?
- My fault. Long story.

370
00:34:19,527 --> 00:34:20,562
Your fault?

371
00:34:20,647 --> 00:34:22,877
- I shouldn't have mentioned that.
- You shouldn't have.

372
00:34:22,967 --> 00:34:25,401
- Did you tell him to stop Ellen's test?
- Yes, I did.

373
00:34:25,487 --> 00:34:27,682
- Why?
- I had some concerns.

374
00:34:27,767 --> 00:34:28,802
About what?

375
00:34:28,887 --> 00:34:32,960
In all honesty, I think it's fair to say
that your behaviour recently has been odd.

376
00:34:33,047 --> 00:34:35,242
My behaviour? What do you think,
I'm a Cylon? Me?

377
00:34:35,327 --> 00:34:37,682
You can't deny
that you've been making these...

378
00:34:37,767 --> 00:34:40,520
off-log calls, these mysterious trips
off the ship.

379
00:34:40,607 --> 00:34:41,960
Where did you hear that?

380
00:34:42,047 --> 00:34:44,515
Have you been spying on me?
On my own ship?

381
00:34:44,607 --> 00:34:47,201
Ladies and gentlemen, please.
We're in a laboratory.

382
00:34:47,287 --> 00:34:49,642
There are hazardous
chemical compounds everywhere.

383
00:34:49,727 --> 00:34:52,685
That's a thermo-nuclear bomb,
for frak's sakes.

384
00:34:53,247 --> 00:34:56,842
What do you mean "un-logged"?
"Mysterious trips"? What's going on?

385
00:34:56,927 --> 00:34:59,805
<i>I had to go to the Rising Star
and I didn't want Tigh to know.</i>

386
00:34:59,887 --> 00:35:00,922
Why not?

387
00:35:01,007 --> 00:35:03,805
Because whether or not his wife is a Cylon,
she's trouble...

388
00:35:03,887 --> 00:35:06,560
and I wanted to keep her away
as long as I could.

389
00:35:06,647 --> 00:35:08,524
Then why did you bring her aboard the ship?

390
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:11,679
Because she's his wife.
And I couldn't refuse her access...

391
00:35:11,767 --> 00:35:14,235
to her own husband
without causing suspicion.

392
00:35:14,327 --> 00:35:16,443
Besides, I wanted her close to me.

393
00:35:16,527 --> 00:35:20,202
I told you. I told you he wanted me.

394
00:35:20,287 --> 00:35:22,243
- Lovely.
- What the hell's going on?

395
00:35:22,327 --> 00:35:25,285
You have been secretly visiting my wife?

396
00:35:25,367 --> 00:35:28,757
No. Yes. But it's complicated.

397
00:35:28,847 --> 00:35:32,123
- I told you. He's been after me for years.
- What?

398
00:35:32,207 --> 00:35:34,801
Now boys, boys, don't fight
over little old me.

399
00:35:34,887 --> 00:35:37,003
- Ellen, be quiet!
- You don't tell me what to do.

400
00:35:37,087 --> 00:35:39,647
We should all take a deep breath.
I will!

401
00:35:39,727 --> 00:35:43,686
I was afraid that she might be a Cylon!
I brought her blood here to test it.

402
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:46,884
That's why you cancelled your test.
How'd you know that?

403
00:35:46,967 --> 00:35:49,800
You didn't tell me
he was testing my wife.

404
00:35:50,647 --> 00:35:55,516
- You met with the President?
- Yes. She thought you might be a Cylon.

405
00:35:59,087 --> 00:36:00,281
I know.

406
00:36:01,527 --> 00:36:04,485
<i>Attention. Pass the word
for the Commander, XO and the CAG.</i>

407
00:36:04,567 --> 00:36:08,879
<i>Commander Adama, Col. Tigh,
and Captain Adama, please report to CIC.</i>

408
00:36:15,767 --> 00:36:17,086
Mr. Gaeta.

409
00:36:17,447 --> 00:36:20,359
The Raider smoothed out
its flight path about two minutes ago.

410
00:36:20,447 --> 00:36:21,960
It seems to be under control.

411
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:25,164
- Yeah, but he's not jumping for home.
- No, sir, he isn't.

412
00:36:25,247 --> 00:36:28,125
Has our reconnaissance detected
any outgoing communications...

413
00:36:28,207 --> 00:36:30,243
since he straightened out his flight pattern?

414
00:36:30,327 --> 00:36:33,797
Yes, sir, but it's likely
it's just another distress signal.

415
00:36:39,287 --> 00:36:41,323
Launch the alert fighters.

416
00:36:46,927 --> 00:36:48,997
This is the CAG. Launch the alert fighters.

417
00:36:49,087 --> 00:36:53,046
Sir, I hate to tell you this, but I think
it's been playing with us the entire time.

418
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:54,879
It was waiting to see how we'd react.

419
00:36:54,967 --> 00:36:56,878
- Playing with us?
- Yeah.

420
00:36:56,967 --> 00:36:59,765
- Order the flight leader to destroy the target!
- Yes, sir.

421
00:37:01,527 --> 00:37:03,563
<i>Galactica, Hot Dog. The Raider just took off!</i>

422
00:37:03,647 --> 00:37:06,366
He doesn't look injured to me.
He's heading back to the fleet!

423
00:37:06,447 --> 00:37:09,803
<i>- They're not going to catch him.
- Action Stations, set Condition One.</i>

424
00:37:09,887 --> 00:37:12,799
<i>- This is not a drill.
- He doesn't have any weapons.</i>

425
00:37:12,887 --> 00:37:14,718
He's on a suicide run.

426
00:37:31,927 --> 00:37:36,284
- Did you launch the alert fighters?
- It was the XO's call.

427
00:37:38,727 --> 00:37:41,764
- I had a hunch.
- Good call.

428
00:37:46,567 --> 00:37:48,523
- One question.
- Because I was worried.

429
00:37:48,607 --> 00:37:50,882
- That she might be a Cylon.
- And if she wasn't.

430
00:37:50,967 --> 00:37:54,562
I know how you feel about her, Saul.
She's been a negative force in your life.

431
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,000
I'm sorry, but it's the truth.

432
00:37:56,087 --> 00:37:58,396
Maybe she was.
Everything was different then.

433
00:37:58,487 --> 00:38:00,955
She was different. I was different.

434
00:38:01,167 --> 00:38:04,204
I've grown accustomed to seeing you
without the cup in your hand.

435
00:38:04,287 --> 00:38:06,562
So I had a couple of drinks tonight.

436
00:38:06,647 --> 00:38:10,276
- I was celebrating. I think I deserved to...
- Yes, you did.

437
00:38:10,967 --> 00:38:13,481
Launching those fighters on a hunch.

438
00:38:14,727 --> 00:38:16,399
You saved our ship.

439
00:38:23,007 --> 00:38:26,124
Just doing my job.
You do your job good.

440
00:38:26,287 --> 00:38:30,838
That's why I need you, Saul.
That, and that we're friends.

441
00:38:31,127 --> 00:38:34,005
I don't want anything to come between that,
not even Ellen.

442
00:38:34,087 --> 00:38:35,361
It won't.

443
00:38:41,607 --> 00:38:45,361
We've searched every street,
every building.

444
00:38:47,807 --> 00:38:49,684
They slipped through. How's that possible?

445
00:38:49,767 --> 00:38:53,123
She thinks she loves him.
Now that she can't live without him.

446
00:38:53,207 --> 00:38:56,040
Her passion is making her more resourceful.

447
00:38:58,327 --> 00:39:01,683
- Bothers you, doesn't it?
- We'll get them in the end.

448
00:39:02,927 --> 00:39:06,203
No, it bothers you
that you've never experienced it.

449
00:39:07,767 --> 00:39:10,804
You saw the way Helo was
when we took her away?

450
00:39:11,127 --> 00:39:12,719
He was pathetic.

451
00:39:15,807 --> 00:39:19,959
I can't help wondering what it would be like
to feel that intensely.

452
00:39:22,607 --> 00:39:27,123
Even in his anguish, he seemed so alive.

453
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:48,717
Green. Green, everyone.

454
00:39:49,807 --> 00:39:52,241
Mrs. Tigh is definitely human.

455
00:39:56,207 --> 00:40:00,598
- No hard feelings, I hope, Ellen.
- I completely understand.

456
00:40:01,407 --> 00:40:03,523
But let's be sure and test you next.

457
00:40:03,607 --> 00:40:07,077
- Doctor?
- My pleasure. My job.

458
00:40:10,127 --> 00:40:13,802
You don't want to frak with me, Bill.
Try to remember that.

459
00:40:15,927 --> 00:40:18,316
Don't frak with me either, Ellen.

460
00:40:21,807 --> 00:40:25,402
If only they knew
that everyone passes these days.

461
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:28,475
Why, it's so much simpler that way.

462
00:40:28,887 --> 00:40:30,525
No muss, no fuss.

463
00:40:37,967 --> 00:40:40,162
What did her test really say?

464
00:40:42,407 --> 00:40:43,999
I'll never tell.
