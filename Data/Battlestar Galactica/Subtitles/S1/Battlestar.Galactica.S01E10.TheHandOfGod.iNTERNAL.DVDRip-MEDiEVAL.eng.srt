1
00:00:02,367 --> 00:00:04,801
<i>Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.</i>

2
00:00:34,647 --> 00:00:37,320
Your doctor back on Caprica
was right.

3
00:00:37,407 --> 00:00:40,399
It's too damn late to operate,
the cancer is too far advanced.

4
00:00:40,487 --> 00:00:43,240
Have you ever heard of Chamalla extract?

5
00:00:43,367 --> 00:00:46,484
It means that you're still acting
like you're everyone's best friend.

6
00:00:46,567 --> 00:00:48,239
We're not friends, you're the CAG.

7
00:00:48,327 --> 00:00:50,522
The Chief wanted me
to kick your ass out of bed.

8
00:00:50,607 --> 00:00:54,520
But, clearly, you still need the rest.
Take your time. No rush.

9
00:00:54,607 --> 00:00:57,519
I need new pilots.
And I want you to train them.

10
00:00:57,607 --> 00:00:59,086
I can do that.

11
00:00:59,327 --> 00:01:01,238
They slipped through. How's that possible?

12
00:01:01,367 --> 00:01:04,484
She thinks she loves him.
Now that she can't live without him.

13
00:01:04,567 --> 00:01:08,082
- Bothers you, doesn't it?
- We'll get them in the end.

14
00:01:13,047 --> 00:01:16,562
I can assure you that fuel shortage
is our number one priority.

15
00:01:16,647 --> 00:01:19,366
<i>Galactica has ships
scouring the nearby star systems...</i>

16
00:01:19,447 --> 00:01:22,007
and we can anticipate
that they will soon find tylium.

17
00:01:26,967 --> 00:01:28,241
Hamilton?

18
00:01:28,327 --> 00:01:30,716
Madam President,
tylium ore is extremely rare.

19
00:01:30,807 --> 00:01:34,800
If we don't find any,
how long before the fleet runs out of fuel?

20
00:01:35,167 --> 00:01:37,556
That all depends on how well we conserve.

21
00:01:37,647 --> 00:01:41,686
Isn't it a fact, Ma'am President, that we
only have enough for two more jumps?

22
00:01:41,767 --> 00:01:43,564
Yes. That is correct.

23
00:01:45,247 --> 00:01:48,683
Do we have a contingency plan
if we run out of tylium?

24
00:02:00,247 --> 00:02:01,726
We would...

25
00:02:04,087 --> 00:02:07,079
If that were to happen...

26
00:02:07,167 --> 00:02:09,362
we would use our last fuel...

27
00:02:09,887 --> 00:02:12,481
to jump to the nearest planetary system.

28
00:02:12,567 --> 00:02:16,037
And pray we're lucky enough
to find a habitable planet.

29
00:02:21,127 --> 00:02:25,598
Madam President, without fuel to take
even the most basic evasive manoeuvres...

30
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:26,836
No...

31
00:02:30,887 --> 00:02:33,959
wouldn't we be like ducks
in a Cylon shooting gallery?

32
00:02:34,047 --> 00:02:35,526
Yes, we would.

33
00:02:48,727 --> 00:02:50,240
I'm...

34
00:02:50,767 --> 00:02:52,120
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:53,887 --> 00:02:55,639
That is all for now.

36
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:11,006
She did not do this.

37
00:03:13,287 --> 00:03:16,438
<i>Commencing sweep 87 of asteroid field.</i>

38
00:03:22,807 --> 00:03:24,081
Any luck?

39
00:03:24,367 --> 00:03:26,961
How many times are you gonna
ask me that, Boomer?

40
00:03:27,047 --> 00:03:29,641
Well, until you find some tylium ore.

41
00:03:30,487 --> 00:03:33,604
Don't you want to be a hero
to Ensign Davis?

42
00:03:35,087 --> 00:03:38,557
You haven't noticed how
she always sits next to you in the mess?

43
00:03:38,647 --> 00:03:42,401
"How's it going, Crash?
You look so cute. "

44
00:03:43,247 --> 00:03:46,523
Damn it. There's so much debris
in this system, the dradis is useless.

45
00:03:46,607 --> 00:03:48,120
This is going to take 100 years.

46
00:03:48,207 --> 00:03:52,803
I heard about how you found
water, how you saved the whole place...

47
00:04:01,687 --> 00:04:05,760
Jackpot, Boomer. That asteroid dead ahead
is a mountain of tylium.

48
00:04:07,687 --> 00:04:08,961
Check it.

49
00:04:10,287 --> 00:04:13,279
Thank the Gods! We're heroes. Yeah.

50
00:04:13,367 --> 00:04:14,925
"We're heroes. " It never fails.

51
00:04:15,007 --> 00:04:18,636
Great, the second that I score,
the bus driver jumps in and takes the credit.

52
00:04:18,727 --> 00:04:21,844
- Okay, so who's the one that we suggest...
- What?

53
00:04:24,167 --> 00:04:25,395
Cylons.

54
00:04:29,447 --> 00:04:31,244
The rock's crawling with them.

55
00:04:31,327 --> 00:04:33,477
We are well and truly fracked.

56
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:36,718
Only tylium within 12 light years
and we've got to kiss it goodbye.

57
00:04:36,807 --> 00:04:40,561
Yeah, along with our asses
if we don't get out of here fast.

58
00:05:52,247 --> 00:05:56,479
It figures the Cylons would be sitting
on the only source of fuel within our reach.

59
00:05:56,567 --> 00:05:58,842
Still staking out every waterhole
in the desert.

60
00:05:58,927 --> 00:06:03,239
Only this time it's a lake, enough tylium
to last us a couple of years.

61
00:06:03,647 --> 00:06:05,797
This must be
some kind of conveyor belt...

62
00:06:05,887 --> 00:06:08,640
to get the ore from the mine here
into this cracking plant here.

63
00:06:08,727 --> 00:06:10,718
A refinery this far
from their home world?

64
00:06:10,807 --> 00:06:13,082
Why not?
They need fuel as much as we do.

65
00:06:13,167 --> 00:06:14,441
Now they've got it.

66
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,836
And enough firepower to keep it.

67
00:06:18,847 --> 00:06:21,839
All right. So we forget
this asteroid, find another source.

68
00:06:21,927 --> 00:06:24,885
You can bet your ass
the Cylons will be guarding that one, too.

69
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:28,482
We send the Raptors out farther.
Find a source they haven't reached yet.

70
00:06:28,567 --> 00:06:32,480
We'll use up all our fuel doing it.
How're we going to get our refinery ship...

71
00:06:32,567 --> 00:06:34,478
We take the tylium from the Cylons.

72
00:06:40,207 --> 00:06:44,041
With all respect, this is hardly a time
to attack a superior force.

73
00:06:44,127 --> 00:06:46,118
This is exactly the time.

74
00:06:46,647 --> 00:06:49,684
We know where they are.
They don't know where we are.

75
00:06:49,767 --> 00:06:52,440
We'll catch them with their pants down.

76
00:06:53,567 --> 00:06:54,920
If we fail?

77
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,886
End of game.

78
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,719
So we don't fail.

79
00:07:02,007 --> 00:07:03,998
When the missile
gets close enough...

80
00:07:04,087 --> 00:07:05,600
you'll be pulling maybe 7 G's.

81
00:07:05,687 --> 00:07:08,645
But to catch you,
the bastard's gonna have to pile on 40 to 60.

82
00:07:08,727 --> 00:07:11,685
Its guidance system can't hack it,
and it'll miss...

83
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:13,405
most of the time.

84
00:07:13,687 --> 00:07:16,076
Exactly how often is "most of the time"?

85
00:07:16,167 --> 00:07:19,364
It depends on your judgment,
and how well you pray.

86
00:07:19,447 --> 00:07:21,119
Attention on deck.

87
00:07:23,327 --> 00:07:25,045
As you were.

88
00:07:25,687 --> 00:07:27,598
Lt. Thrace, can I have a word?

89
00:07:27,687 --> 00:07:29,962
Of course. Take five, guys.

90
00:07:30,927 --> 00:07:33,157
What's up?
How are they doing?

91
00:07:33,247 --> 00:07:36,683
Wobbly as newborn colts,
but they're getting stronger.

92
00:07:37,807 --> 00:07:39,206
That's good.

93
00:07:40,407 --> 00:07:42,079
Got a job for you.

94
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:45,959
Rumour mill has it
that you're planning an op.

95
00:07:46,047 --> 00:07:48,436
Rumour mill's right for a change.

96
00:07:48,887 --> 00:07:52,243
Capt. Adama and Col. Tigh
are working up the plan now...

97
00:07:52,327 --> 00:07:55,080
and I need some serious
out-of-the-box thinking.

98
00:07:55,167 --> 00:07:57,442
Out-of-the-box is where I live.

99
00:08:02,807 --> 00:08:06,038
I've been taking Chamalla
for a medical condition.

100
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:09,964
So what have you seen?

101
00:08:10,047 --> 00:08:13,357
It started out as dreams
of the Cylon that we had executed.

102
00:08:13,447 --> 00:08:16,325
But I had the dreams
before we captured him.

103
00:08:16,527 --> 00:08:19,963
- The images were...
- Prescient?

104
00:08:20,327 --> 00:08:21,919
Uncanny.

105
00:08:22,327 --> 00:08:25,763
And now I'm seeing things while I'm awake.

106
00:08:28,887 --> 00:08:31,924
- What kind of things?
- Snakes.

107
00:08:32,127 --> 00:08:36,837
There were snakes crawling all over
my podium during a press conference.

108
00:08:37,127 --> 00:08:40,915
- How many?
- About a dozen.

109
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:48,040
You're kidding, right?

110
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,880
<i>You read Pythia,
and now you're having me on.</i>

111
00:08:50,967 --> 00:08:52,116
No.

112
00:08:52,807 --> 00:08:56,641
- Who is Pythia?
- One of the oracles in the sacred scrolls.

113
00:08:57,567 --> 00:08:59,842
3,600 years ago...

114
00:08:59,927 --> 00:09:03,715
Pythia wrote about the exile
and the rebirth of the human race.

115
00:09:03,807 --> 00:09:05,479
<i>And the Lords anointed a leader...</i>

116
00:09:05,567 --> 00:09:08,639
to guide the caravan of the heavens
to their new homeland.

117
00:09:08,727 --> 00:09:11,161
<i>And unto the leader they gave a vision...</i>

118
00:09:11,247 --> 00:09:14,284
of serpents, numbering two and ten...

119
00:09:14,527 --> 00:09:16,677
as a sign of things to come.

120
00:09:17,687 --> 00:09:18,802
Pythia wrote that?

121
00:09:18,887 --> 00:09:21,924
She also wrote that the new leader suffered
a wasting disease...

122
00:09:22,007 --> 00:09:23,918
and would not live to enter the new land.

123
00:09:24,007 --> 00:09:26,646
<i>But you're not dying. Are you?</i>

124
00:09:30,527 --> 00:09:34,759
And that will allow the attack force
to wipe out these installations here.

125
00:09:35,087 --> 00:09:38,762
Now, if we do it right,
there won't be any Cylon survivors.

126
00:09:40,007 --> 00:09:42,646
And the asteroid will be ours.

127
00:09:45,847 --> 00:09:48,315
What do you think, Starbuck?

128
00:09:48,887 --> 00:09:52,926
It's a textbook perfect plan,
which is why it won't work.

129
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:57,601
Of course. We bow to your
vast experience in strategic planning.

130
00:09:57,687 --> 00:10:01,043
Refresh my memory. What year was it
that you graduated from war college?

131
00:10:01,127 --> 00:10:03,516
What's the matter,
married life not all you expected?

132
00:10:03,607 --> 00:10:05,086
Enough. Both of you.

133
00:10:05,727 --> 00:10:08,560
<i>We're not going to win this one by the book.</i>

134
00:10:08,647 --> 00:10:10,319
<i>I want Starbuck in here...</i>

135
00:10:10,407 --> 00:10:13,922
because she's not weighed down
by conventional thinking.

136
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:18,035
All due respect, gentlemen,
we're not as crazy as she is.

137
00:10:19,847 --> 00:10:22,600
Okay. So what would you do differently?

138
00:10:25,847 --> 00:10:27,200
To start...

139
00:10:27,847 --> 00:10:29,917
<i>jumping Galactica in behind the planetoid...</i>

140
00:10:30,007 --> 00:10:32,885
to hide it from the Cylon base
is an obvious move.

141
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:36,004
You think they'll be covering that blind spot
with recon patrols?

142
00:10:36,087 --> 00:10:38,043
I would, if I were them.

143
00:10:38,527 --> 00:10:42,679
What we need to do is make their patrols
part of our plan, you know?

144
00:10:43,167 --> 00:10:45,442
Make their tactics work for us.

145
00:10:47,207 --> 00:10:49,323
<i>Here's what I would do:</i>

146
00:10:51,487 --> 00:10:53,079
<i>At position code Deacon...</i>

147
00:10:53,167 --> 00:10:56,364
we'll need three civilian freighter ships
to use as decoys.

148
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:59,803
Which means those passengers
will have to be relocated to other ships...

149
00:10:59,887 --> 00:11:01,764
which are already overcrowded.

150
00:11:01,847 --> 00:11:03,599
Yes, if you approve.

151
00:11:03,927 --> 00:11:06,725
The decoy ships
will jump into the enemy star system...

152
00:11:06,807 --> 00:11:09,321
at extreme radar range
from the Cylon asteroid.

153
00:11:09,407 --> 00:11:11,443
<i>Galactica will jump here...</i>

154
00:11:11,527 --> 00:11:13,722
close enough to launch its Vipers
at the base.

155
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:17,595
Soon as the decoy freighters arrive
in the system, they'll break wireless silence.

156
00:11:17,687 --> 00:11:20,565
They'll be posing as a mining fleet
coming after the tylium...

157
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:22,922
and pretend to be unaware
of the Cylon presence.

158
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,077
The Cylons will hear
the messages...

159
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:26,805
and send a force of Raiders after them.

160
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:29,526
<i>This will leave the base
relatively undefended.</i>

161
00:11:29,607 --> 00:11:32,883
<i>We'll have Raptors pre-positioned
to keep an eye on the Cylons.</i>

162
00:11:32,967 --> 00:11:35,037
When the Cylons
move toward the decoys...

163
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:38,403
<i>Galactica's Vipers will come in from behind,
and obliterate the base.</i>

164
00:11:38,487 --> 00:11:41,797
Without the base,
they'll be unable to rearm, refuel.

165
00:11:41,887 --> 00:11:44,321
We'll mop them up,
and then we'll take the tylium.

166
00:11:44,407 --> 00:11:47,160
What happens to the crews
on the civilian decoy ships?

167
00:11:47,247 --> 00:11:51,320
They'll keep their FTL drives spooled up,
and jump clear the first sign of trouble.

168
00:11:51,407 --> 00:11:53,318
How many casualties do you anticipate?

169
00:11:53,407 --> 00:11:54,886
It'll cost us.

170
00:12:00,167 --> 00:12:03,955
If you succeed, what's to prevent the Cylons
from coming back with reinforcements?

171
00:12:04,047 --> 00:12:05,400
Nothing.

172
00:12:05,487 --> 00:12:07,921
But if we get a chance
to knock out that base...

173
00:12:08,007 --> 00:12:09,759
it will buy us some time.

174
00:12:09,847 --> 00:12:10,916
Why?

175
00:12:11,007 --> 00:12:13,123
If you keep running
from the schoolyard bully...

176
00:12:13,207 --> 00:12:16,244
he keeps on chasing you.
But when you turn around and stop...

177
00:12:16,327 --> 00:12:19,046
and you punch him really hard
in a sensitive spot...

178
00:12:19,127 --> 00:12:21,516
he'll think twice about coming back again.

179
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:24,599
So it's either this,
or run out of fuel and be annihilated.

180
00:12:24,687 --> 00:12:27,520
Sometimes you have to roll the hard six.

181
00:12:29,007 --> 00:12:32,044
Well, the freighters are yours.
Good hunting, everyone.

182
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,277
Operation starts in 48 hours.

183
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:36,085
This is our target.

184
00:12:36,967 --> 00:12:38,400
A Cylon base?

185
00:12:39,447 --> 00:12:41,597
And you're the Cylon expert.

186
00:12:42,007 --> 00:12:44,396
We need to destroy
their military facilities.

187
00:12:44,487 --> 00:12:47,559
Without harming the tylium ore
under the surface.

188
00:12:47,647 --> 00:12:48,875
Exactly.

189
00:12:49,567 --> 00:12:51,922
A nuke would destroy the Cylons.

190
00:12:52,007 --> 00:12:56,285
But the radiation
would render the ore inert, unusable.

191
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:59,245
I see your dilemma.

192
00:13:01,887 --> 00:13:03,445
Well, you're in luck, you know.

193
00:13:03,527 --> 00:13:05,882
Refined tylium
contains tremendous enthalpy...

194
00:13:05,967 --> 00:13:08,322
to the order of half a billion
mega joules per kilo.

195
00:13:08,407 --> 00:13:12,082
<i>Subjected to right heat and compression,
say, from a conventional warhead...</i>

196
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:14,362
you should get
a suitably devastating explosion...

197
00:13:14,447 --> 00:13:16,517
without the radioactive fallout.

198
00:13:16,607 --> 00:13:18,802
All we have to do is hit the right spot.

199
00:13:18,887 --> 00:13:22,596
Specifically, you must hit the staging tanks
for the refined tylium precursor.

200
00:13:22,687 --> 00:13:26,157
It's a lot more unstable than the fuel itself.

201
00:13:26,607 --> 00:13:28,563
And where would they be?

202
00:13:32,367 --> 00:13:34,642
I need your advice on this one.

203
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:38,478
I'm flattered, Gaius...

204
00:13:38,847 --> 00:13:42,203
but I don't know
the first thing about tylium refineries.

205
00:13:42,287 --> 00:13:43,720
Neither do I.

206
00:13:46,127 --> 00:13:48,243
Oh, come on, you must have an inkling...

207
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,966
- where I should tell them to bomb?
- No.

208
00:13:52,367 --> 00:13:55,165
But God does.
Oh, good.

209
00:13:56,967 --> 00:14:00,164
I suppose God doesn't want me
to destroy the base...

210
00:14:02,807 --> 00:14:05,640
because he's the Cylon God. Right?

211
00:14:06,087 --> 00:14:07,998
God doesn't take sides.

212
00:14:09,647 --> 00:14:11,603
He only wants your love.

213
00:14:13,167 --> 00:14:16,477
Open your heart to him,
and he'll show you the way.

214
00:14:16,767 --> 00:14:19,076
It'd be a lot simpler
if he came out and told me.

215
00:14:19,167 --> 00:14:23,524
You must remember to surrender your ego.
Remain humble.

216
00:14:24,687 --> 00:14:26,643
If you ask me...

217
00:14:26,807 --> 00:14:30,561
God could do with cleaning his ears out.
Then he'd hear what I have to say.

218
00:14:30,647 --> 00:14:33,207
- Relax your neck.
- Why? What are you going to do?

219
00:14:33,287 --> 00:14:35,801
I said relax.
All right, but please don't...

220
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:40,443
Where
would the staging tanks be, Doctor?

221
00:14:55,047 --> 00:14:56,765
There. Right there.

222
00:14:58,487 --> 00:15:02,799
Hit any one of them and the place
will go up like a three kiloton bomb.

223
00:15:23,927 --> 00:15:25,246
Well done.

224
00:15:26,127 --> 00:15:30,837
Forceful, so decisive,
delivered with such élan.

225
00:15:32,767 --> 00:15:34,598
He didn't speak to me.

226
00:15:36,047 --> 00:15:37,958
God didn't speak to me.

227
00:15:39,767 --> 00:15:41,519
I was totally lying.

228
00:15:41,927 --> 00:15:43,838
I just picked that spot at random.

229
00:15:43,927 --> 00:15:46,680
He doesn't always speak in words, Gaius.

230
00:15:50,607 --> 00:15:52,086
So the fate...

231
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:57,036
of the entire human race
depends upon my wild guess.

232
00:16:15,527 --> 00:16:17,916
Attention on deck.
As you were.

233
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:25,922
How's the knee, Starbuck?

234
00:16:26,007 --> 00:16:28,999
It'll be ready. I'm not missing this party.

235
00:16:36,247 --> 00:16:40,445
Apollo's leading the strike force.
You'll have to sit this one out.

236
00:16:40,527 --> 00:16:43,724
- I'm the best pilot that you have.
- Not right now.

237
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,920
In combat, you got to pull 6, 7 G's.

238
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:50,284
<i>Doc says your knee won't take it.</i>

239
00:16:50,367 --> 00:16:52,597
- Well, then he's wrong.
- Is he?

240
00:16:56,687 --> 00:16:58,678
A Viper thruster pedal...

241
00:16:58,927 --> 00:17:01,999
requires this much force...

242
00:17:05,287 --> 00:17:06,686
to activate.

243
00:17:14,327 --> 00:17:16,557
Now you're on your attack run.

244
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,283
<i>They launch their missiles...</i>

245
00:17:19,367 --> 00:17:22,677
so you've got to jam that pedal...

246
00:17:24,287 --> 00:17:26,039
into the firewall...

247
00:17:26,967 --> 00:17:29,765
and hold a 6 G turn...

248
00:17:33,687 --> 00:17:35,723
for 10 seconds or you die.

249
00:17:37,607 --> 00:17:40,519
10, 9, 8...

250
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:45,643
7, 6, 5, 4.

251
00:17:56,407 --> 00:17:59,240
This is only 3 G's, Starbuck. Not 6.

252
00:18:00,727 --> 00:18:02,877
I'm sorry. It's a tough one.

253
00:18:03,847 --> 00:18:05,803
But you're staying home.

254
00:18:10,527 --> 00:18:12,802
Keep your ingress low and fast.

255
00:18:13,167 --> 00:18:15,840
Use the terrain to stay hidden
till the last second.

256
00:18:15,927 --> 00:18:18,680
Make sure you give
the flak suppression unit enough time...

257
00:18:18,767 --> 00:18:20,917
so they can weaken defences.

258
00:18:21,247 --> 00:18:24,398
You don't think I'm up to this?
Of course I do.

259
00:18:24,927 --> 00:18:26,440
You'll be fine.

260
00:18:32,807 --> 00:18:36,322
Look, you're worried that
I'm not gonna pull it out of the fire...

261
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:38,682
with some high-risk retina-detaching move...

262
00:18:38,767 --> 00:18:40,678
the way Starbuck would.

263
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:43,317
Look, Kara, I'm sorry you're not suiting up.

264
00:18:43,407 --> 00:18:46,080
'Cause everyone would feel so much better,
me included...

265
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,158
if you were riding along with us.

266
00:18:48,247 --> 00:18:51,125
But this isn't an ego trip. This is my job.

267
00:18:51,247 --> 00:18:53,966
And don't think for one moment
that I will not get it done.

268
00:18:54,047 --> 00:18:56,686
I hope so. Because we've got one shot.

269
00:18:57,647 --> 00:19:00,081
Don't frack it up by over-thinking.

270
00:19:10,967 --> 00:19:13,720
Nice thing about being on the run
after a nuclear war...

271
00:19:13,807 --> 00:19:17,482
nobody left to complain if we hide out
in their barn or raid their pantry...

272
00:19:17,567 --> 00:19:21,116
while you're on your way to steal a ship,
and get off the planet.

273
00:19:21,207 --> 00:19:23,243
- It's odd, isn't it?
- What?

274
00:19:23,847 --> 00:19:26,520
That we haven't seen
a single living human being...

275
00:19:26,607 --> 00:19:28,962
since the one you shot
when you rescued me.

276
00:19:29,047 --> 00:19:31,515
We're still alive. Why nobody else?

277
00:19:32,447 --> 00:19:36,360
Probably holed up
in the fallout shelters or something.

278
00:19:43,887 --> 00:19:46,720
Two ways out and a lovely view.
What could be better?

279
00:19:46,807 --> 00:19:49,367
A feather bed with a silk comforter.

280
00:20:04,807 --> 00:20:06,160
You hungry?

281
00:20:08,367 --> 00:20:11,484
I don't know. What do we got?
Peanut butter...

282
00:20:16,927 --> 00:20:19,441
baked beans, corn...

283
00:20:22,767 --> 00:20:24,598
How about some chilli?

284
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:31,118
A simple "no" would do.

285
00:20:32,007 --> 00:20:35,443
Sharon, have you been taking
your anti-radiation meds?

286
00:20:36,247 --> 00:20:39,683
I think it was those cold beans
we had this afternoon.

287
00:20:42,607 --> 00:20:44,677
- You okay now?
- Yeah.

288
00:20:47,927 --> 00:20:50,122
How far you figure to Delphi?

289
00:20:51,967 --> 00:20:54,959
Eight, maybe ten days if we move fast.

290
00:20:56,247 --> 00:20:59,444
If we start early, we can be there in no time.

291
00:21:08,887 --> 00:21:10,286
Can't sleep?

292
00:21:15,287 --> 00:21:17,721
I couldn't either before a big op.

293
00:21:19,607 --> 00:21:21,040
<i>The Mark II.</i>

294
00:21:22,327 --> 00:21:23,646
Good ship.

295
00:21:25,527 --> 00:21:28,121
Got me out of
a lot of tough scrapes.

296
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:36,237
I've got something for you.

297
00:21:37,847 --> 00:21:40,156
It belonged to your grandfather.

298
00:21:41,287 --> 00:21:44,563
My mum bought it for him
when he was in law school.

299
00:21:49,807 --> 00:21:51,957
You see the engraving on it?

300
00:21:53,487 --> 00:21:56,320
Yeah, I can barely make it out, but...

301
00:21:58,647 --> 00:22:01,081
He was a better father than I was.

302
00:22:06,287 --> 00:22:08,596
Dad used to carry that into court cases.

303
00:22:08,687 --> 00:22:12,965
Claimed he never lost
unless he left it behind.

304
00:22:18,407 --> 00:22:20,318
So you're worried, too?

305
00:22:23,567 --> 00:22:24,920
About what?

306
00:22:25,167 --> 00:22:27,886
You know, sometimes it feels
like the whole ship...

307
00:22:27,967 --> 00:22:30,686
thinks Starbuck would do better.

308
00:22:32,007 --> 00:22:33,235
I don't.

309
00:22:35,967 --> 00:22:37,878
How can you be so sure?

310
00:22:40,327 --> 00:22:42,158
Because you're my son.

311
00:22:55,727 --> 00:22:57,524
Get some rest.

312
00:22:58,647 --> 00:23:00,603
You're going to need it.

313
00:23:04,447 --> 00:23:05,596
Dad...

314
00:23:09,927 --> 00:23:11,645
I'll bring it back.

315
00:23:12,527 --> 00:23:16,202
You'd better, or I'll kick your ass.
It's a good lighter.

316
00:23:44,687 --> 00:23:46,279
Sharon. Wake up.

317
00:23:55,727 --> 00:23:58,764
What the frack! You killed her...
Let me see.

318
00:24:09,127 --> 00:24:11,277
We gotta go. Right now.

319
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:15,962
Wait a minute. I saw her on my lap.
I saw her blood spill on my lap.

320
00:24:16,047 --> 00:24:17,765
Let's move, mister.

321
00:24:26,647 --> 00:24:30,879
- What the hell is going on?
- I don't know. We'll figure it out later.

322
00:24:38,967 --> 00:24:41,606
Jump complete, sir.
Dradis reports nothing but hash.

323
00:24:41,687 --> 00:24:44,201
Just as we expected. Can't see a thing.

324
00:24:44,287 --> 00:24:46,323
<i>We are now within launch range
of the Cylon base.</i>

325
00:24:46,407 --> 00:24:50,036
<i>...Constellation
jump complete on station, point Deacon.</i>

326
00:24:50,127 --> 00:24:51,526
<i>Initiate search pattern, Delta.</i>

327
00:24:51,607 --> 00:24:54,167
<i>Ore flight Bravo.
Delta, Wilco.</i>

328
00:24:54,247 --> 00:24:56,397
<i>Ore flight Nebula,
Delta initiated.</i>

329
00:24:56,487 --> 00:24:58,205
The ball's in play.

330
00:24:59,087 --> 00:25:01,237
You can bet they heard that.

331
00:25:02,487 --> 00:25:05,081
Now they'll try to locate the decoys.

332
00:25:05,287 --> 00:25:06,800
And when they do?

333
00:25:06,887 --> 00:25:09,879
If they take the bait, all hell breaks loose.

334
00:25:10,647 --> 00:25:13,445
- Until then?
- We wait.

335
00:25:32,087 --> 00:25:33,520
<i>Galactica, Boomer.</i>

336
00:25:33,607 --> 00:25:35,723
Tally, 90 plus, headed Deacon.

337
00:25:35,807 --> 00:25:37,399
<i>Speed, 250.</i>

338
00:25:43,887 --> 00:25:48,119
<i>The Cylons have seen
the freighter. They're en route to intercept it.</i>

339
00:25:48,767 --> 00:25:50,359
They took the bait.

340
00:25:50,447 --> 00:25:53,883
- Mr. Gaeta, launch Strike Force 1.
- Aye, sir.

341
00:25:54,807 --> 00:25:56,399
D, launch strike force one.

342
00:25:56,487 --> 00:25:58,159
Attention. Pilots, man your planes.

343
00:25:58,287 --> 00:26:00,243
<i>Pilots, man your planes.</i>

344
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:16,116
- How hard did they bite?
- Boomer's report said 90 plus.

345
00:26:16,527 --> 00:26:19,519
They've launched most of their fighter force.

346
00:26:27,007 --> 00:26:29,157
Give them hell, sir.
Firing.

347
00:26:41,407 --> 00:26:43,204
Attack forces away.

348
00:26:43,807 --> 00:26:45,718
I just hope that Lee can...

349
00:26:48,327 --> 00:26:50,204
Lee isn't the problem.

350
00:26:51,607 --> 00:26:54,360
You should take a good look at yourself.

351
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,642
I had to go through the same transition.

352
00:26:57,727 --> 00:27:00,719
When you're in the cockpit,
you're in control.

353
00:27:01,047 --> 00:27:03,003
It's hard to give it up.

354
00:27:04,327 --> 00:27:07,922
It would just be a lot easier
if I was flying with them.

355
00:27:08,487 --> 00:27:11,877
All you can do now is wait,
and hope you didn't make any mistakes.

356
00:27:11,967 --> 00:27:14,845
I never wanted this kind of responsibility.

357
00:27:15,887 --> 00:27:18,685
The Cylons never asked us what we wanted.

358
00:27:19,567 --> 00:27:21,637
Welcome to the big leagues.

359
00:27:31,967 --> 00:27:33,764
<i>Galactica,
Crashdown.</i>

360
00:27:33,847 --> 00:27:35,997
<i>Tally, 50 plus on an intercept course.</i>

361
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:38,043
Repeat. 50 plus inbound.

362
00:27:40,487 --> 00:27:41,886
What's that mean?

363
00:27:41,967 --> 00:27:45,323
It means that a Cylon patrol
spotted our attack force.

364
00:27:45,407 --> 00:27:48,604
<i>The base sent out
50 more Raiders to intercept.</i>

365
00:27:49,527 --> 00:27:51,006
Fifty Raiders?

366
00:27:51,527 --> 00:27:54,485
That means we're outnumbered now 5-to-1?

367
00:27:55,087 --> 00:27:57,442
Weren't the decoys
supposed to take care of that?

368
00:27:57,527 --> 00:28:00,564
- The Cylons were too smart for that.
- Frack.

369
00:28:02,407 --> 00:28:05,524
Estimated time to strike intercept, 2 minutes.

370
00:28:08,447 --> 00:28:09,721
Fireball...

371
00:28:09,807 --> 00:28:13,277
multiple bandits, left 10 high, range 40.

372
00:28:13,527 --> 00:28:15,518
Weapons free. Committing.

373
00:28:17,887 --> 00:28:20,082
Hot Dog, visual tally, press.

374
00:28:20,727 --> 00:28:22,524
Hot Dog, break right.

375
00:28:28,567 --> 00:28:30,285
Fireball, your six.

376
00:28:32,167 --> 00:28:34,522
I'm hit. Man eject.

377
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:36,282
<i>Stop!</i>

378
00:28:36,367 --> 00:28:39,359
<i>Deadbolt, Spinner.
Two bandits closing your right side.</i>

379
00:28:39,447 --> 00:28:40,641
<i>No joy!</i>

380
00:28:47,047 --> 00:28:50,881
<i>Galactica, Hot Dog.
Heavily engaged. Mission outcome doubtful.</i>

381
00:28:50,967 --> 00:28:54,323
- This sounds fracking awful.
- They're getting cut to pieces out there.

382
00:28:55,247 --> 00:28:57,397
<i>Get out of there! Move!</i>

383
00:28:59,007 --> 00:29:01,396
<i>Deadbolt,
right vertical, now!</i>

384
00:29:01,487 --> 00:29:03,717
<i>Diamond, get a shot.
Get him off me.</i>

385
00:29:03,807 --> 00:29:06,162
Mr. Gaeta, abort Strike 1.

386
00:29:06,527 --> 00:29:08,643
<i>Strike One, Galactica.
Return to base.</i>

387
00:29:08,727 --> 00:29:10,797
Repeat. Abort your mission,
and return to base.

388
00:29:13,767 --> 00:29:15,359
<i>Galactica, Stubb.</i>

389
00:29:15,447 --> 00:29:20,077
<i>Cylon strike force is turning away
from Deacon and inbound to Galactica.</i>

390
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:27,758
Noting Raiders inbound.

391
00:29:29,967 --> 00:29:33,277
The Cylons heard our transmission recall,
didn't they?

392
00:29:33,367 --> 00:29:35,323
Does that mean the first wave of Raiders...

393
00:29:35,407 --> 00:29:38,524
is ignoring the decoys,
and is coming after us?

394
00:29:38,767 --> 00:29:40,962
That's exactly what it means.

395
00:29:53,127 --> 00:29:57,439
<i>So, when are we going to launch
the reserve Vipers to defend Galactica?</i>

396
00:29:57,647 --> 00:30:01,606
There are no reserve Vipers.
Everything is on the board already.

397
00:30:04,767 --> 00:30:06,758
Now we play for all the marbles.

398
00:30:06,887 --> 00:30:08,878
<i>Starbuck, it's your plan.</i>

399
00:30:15,247 --> 00:30:16,646
Mr. Gaeta...

400
00:30:17,527 --> 00:30:21,805
will you please tell D to get on the scrambler
and inform Apollo the back door is open?

401
00:30:21,887 --> 00:30:23,479
Aye, Lieutenant.

402
00:30:23,687 --> 00:30:25,882
D, please send
a scrambler to Capt. Apollo.

403
00:30:25,967 --> 00:30:28,640
Message reads, "The back door is open. "

404
00:30:28,767 --> 00:30:31,918
<i>Apollo, Galactica. Back door is open.</i>

405
00:30:32,007 --> 00:30:33,645
Godspeed, Apollo.

406
00:31:08,087 --> 00:31:10,203
Lt. Thrace, why didn't you tell me...

407
00:31:10,287 --> 00:31:13,643
we had another attack force
hidden in the freighters?

408
00:31:15,127 --> 00:31:17,197
We...
It was my decision.

409
00:31:17,287 --> 00:31:21,246
I routinely restrict tactical details
to those who need to know.

410
00:31:21,767 --> 00:31:23,519
Old habits die hard.

411
00:31:25,167 --> 00:31:27,317
So you still might pull this off?

412
00:31:27,407 --> 00:31:30,001
If Dr. Baltar's target information
is correct.

413
00:31:30,087 --> 00:31:32,965
And whether we get blown to pieces
by those Cylon Raiders...

414
00:31:33,047 --> 00:31:34,275
heading toward us right now.

415
00:31:34,367 --> 00:31:36,961
Speaking of which, I'm needed in CIC.

416
00:31:51,647 --> 00:31:53,842
Initial point in 5 seconds.

417
00:32:00,087 --> 00:32:02,521
Flak suppression unit cleared hot.

418
00:32:04,887 --> 00:32:06,798
<i>Okay, let's do this.</i>

419
00:32:06,887 --> 00:32:09,117
Come on, Lee. It's all on you.

420
00:32:16,327 --> 00:32:17,601
Incoming!

421
00:32:22,327 --> 00:32:24,921
<i>Weapons free.
By the numbers, people.</i>

422
00:32:34,727 --> 00:32:36,479
Target acquired. Tone and lock.

423
00:32:37,167 --> 00:32:38,236
<i>Firing.</i>

424
00:32:38,327 --> 00:32:40,966
Tone and lock. Firing.

425
00:32:45,207 --> 00:32:47,038
What's got into these fracking missiles?

426
00:32:47,127 --> 00:32:48,355
Come on.

427
00:32:48,887 --> 00:32:51,117
They're jamming the guidance systems.

428
00:32:51,207 --> 00:32:52,401
<i>Strike two, Apollo.</i>

429
00:32:52,487 --> 00:32:55,285
Then we get close enough
so we don't need the guidance systems.

430
00:32:55,367 --> 00:32:57,403
<i>We'll have to blow this thing
manually.</i>

431
00:32:57,487 --> 00:32:59,557
Wilco, Apollo. Rolling in.

432
00:33:03,327 --> 00:33:04,601
Chuckles!

433
00:33:08,447 --> 00:33:09,721
Oh, frack.

434
00:33:11,607 --> 00:33:13,882
Chuckles bought it. He's going down!

435
00:33:17,527 --> 00:33:20,200
<i>Now they've got
our attack axis zeroed in.</i>

436
00:33:20,287 --> 00:33:22,881
<i>There's no way to fracking get close.</i>

437
00:33:23,287 --> 00:33:24,356
There's gotta be.

438
00:33:24,447 --> 00:33:26,358
<i>We've got to get out of this flak.</i>

439
00:33:26,447 --> 00:33:29,757
<i>Let's get down below deck,
down where the target is.</i>

440
00:33:32,287 --> 00:33:35,836
I've got an idea.
I'm gonna take a closer look.

441
00:33:46,167 --> 00:33:47,600
Commander on deck.

442
00:33:47,687 --> 00:33:49,040
As you were.

443
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:52,039
The first wave of Cylons will be on us
in three minutes.

444
00:33:52,127 --> 00:33:53,640
Notify the Strike 1 Vipers...

445
00:33:53,727 --> 00:33:56,560
that they can stop running
and blast those bastards to hell.

446
00:33:56,647 --> 00:33:57,841
Yes, sir.

447
00:33:57,927 --> 00:34:01,522
<i>Attacking Cylon fighters.
Target acquired, tone and lock.</i>

448
00:34:18,087 --> 00:34:20,157
Oh, no, don't do this, Lee.

449
00:34:21,047 --> 00:34:24,244
The conveyor tunnel's clear.
I'm going through it.

450
00:34:24,567 --> 00:34:26,523
You're out of your fracking mind, Apollo.

451
00:34:30,207 --> 00:34:31,401
What's going on?

452
00:34:31,487 --> 00:34:34,479
Captain Apollo's flying
into the conveyor tunnel...

453
00:34:34,567 --> 00:34:37,400
hoping it will lead him to the refinery.

454
00:34:38,847 --> 00:34:40,280
Has he gone raving mad?

455
00:34:40,367 --> 00:34:43,803
There's no way to ensure
it does anything of the kind.

456
00:34:55,567 --> 00:34:58,001
Come on, keep it together, Lee.

457
00:35:00,927 --> 00:35:02,246
Oh, lords.

458
00:35:29,967 --> 00:35:34,119
<i>Okay, I'm through the tunnel.
They can't get a firing solution on me.</i>

459
00:35:40,087 --> 00:35:41,566
There you are.

460
00:35:42,367 --> 00:35:45,325
Okay. I've got you. I've got you.

461
00:36:23,487 --> 00:36:26,445
<i>Galactica, Apollo.</i>

462
00:36:27,607 --> 00:36:29,598
<i>Mission accomplished.</i>

463
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:30,756
Yes.

464
00:36:39,127 --> 00:36:41,516
You can tell Dr. Baltar
he was right on the money.

465
00:36:41,607 --> 00:36:43,245
It's one hell of a fireworks show.

466
00:36:43,327 --> 00:36:46,000
<i>And there's plenty more for us
back in the canyon...</i>

467
00:36:46,087 --> 00:36:48,157
<i>once this place is history.</i>

468
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:57,555
Congratulations, Doctor, it worked.

469
00:36:58,407 --> 00:36:59,601
It did.

470
00:37:04,727 --> 00:37:06,046
It worked.

471
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:16,206
I'm sorry, Madam President, I'm sorry.

472
00:37:17,087 --> 00:37:18,884
No need to apologise.

473
00:37:19,327 --> 00:37:23,115
Thanks to you, we have enough fuel
to last us a few years.

474
00:37:30,167 --> 00:37:33,284
Commander, Strike 1 reports
inbound Cylons are bugging out.

475
00:37:33,367 --> 00:37:35,323
<i>Request permission to go after them, sir.</i>

476
00:37:35,407 --> 00:37:38,524
- Tell our people to pursue and destroy them.
- Affirmative.

477
00:37:38,607 --> 00:37:40,598
Strike 1, tear them up.

478
00:37:52,887 --> 00:37:54,764
Apollo, you magnificent bastard.

479
00:37:54,847 --> 00:37:58,635
That was one hell of a piece of flying
and I couldn't have done it better myself.

480
00:37:58,727 --> 00:38:00,319
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.

481
00:38:00,407 --> 00:38:03,080
I said that I couldn't have
done it better myself.

482
00:38:03,167 --> 00:38:04,759
Well, thank you.

483
00:38:07,087 --> 00:38:08,679
I had my doubts.

484
00:38:09,607 --> 00:38:10,881
So did I.

485
00:38:11,087 --> 00:38:15,239
I wasn't sure that crazy ass plan of yours
would even possibly work.

486
00:38:19,847 --> 00:38:21,485
You deserve this.

487
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:31,356
Crash.

488
00:39:09,727 --> 00:39:12,560
Have you read the Pythian Prophecy,
Gaius?

489
00:39:12,967 --> 00:39:14,923
Not since the 6th grade.

490
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:18,997
I can't say ancient history
is my favourite subject.

491
00:39:19,167 --> 00:39:21,806
You should have paid
closer attention.

492
00:39:22,647 --> 00:39:24,046
To what?

493
00:39:24,127 --> 00:39:28,120
"All of this has happened before.
All of this will happen again. "

494
00:39:30,527 --> 00:39:33,803
Everyone knows that verse.
What are you getting at?

495
00:39:36,527 --> 00:39:38,199
Remember this one?

496
00:39:39,047 --> 00:39:41,800
"Led by serpents numbering two and ten. "

497
00:39:42,327 --> 00:39:45,364
The Vipers, they're the serpents?

498
00:39:47,087 --> 00:39:50,636
There's a later verse, Gaius.
You should read it.

499
00:39:52,007 --> 00:39:54,680
"Though the outcome favoured the few...

500
00:39:54,887 --> 00:39:59,085
"it led to a confrontation
at the home of the gods. "

501
00:40:01,807 --> 00:40:06,119
Are you telling me that God
guided my finger to that target for some...

502
00:40:07,487 --> 00:40:09,523
arcane scriptural purpose?

503
00:40:10,887 --> 00:40:13,321
You are part of God's plan, Gaius.

504
00:40:13,967 --> 00:40:16,800
So God wanted me
to destroy the Cylon base.

505
00:40:16,927 --> 00:40:20,886
You did well. You gave yourself over to Him.

506
00:40:27,847 --> 00:40:29,678
Yes, I suppose I did.

507
00:40:37,087 --> 00:40:40,363
There's really no other
logical explanation for it.

508
00:40:46,127 --> 00:40:48,516
- I was...
- Am.

509
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:00,283
I am an instrument of God.
