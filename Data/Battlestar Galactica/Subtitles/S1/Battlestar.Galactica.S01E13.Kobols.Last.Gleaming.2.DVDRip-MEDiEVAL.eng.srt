1
00:00:02,287 --> 00:00:04,721
<i>Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.</i>

2
00:00:35,927 --> 00:00:37,724
Just do it.

3
00:00:39,647 --> 00:00:41,160
<i>Boomer, this could be it.</i>

4
00:00:41,247 --> 00:00:43,807
<i>This is the little planet
that solves all of our problems.</i>

5
00:00:43,887 --> 00:00:45,002
<i>What did you see?</i>

6
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:47,965
A dome-like structure with six roads
leading out of it.

7
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:50,117
This planet is Kobol.

8
00:00:50,207 --> 00:00:53,085
Organise a ground survey team.
Three Raptors.

9
00:00:53,847 --> 00:00:56,202
- They're everywhere!
- We're not getting out of here!

10
00:00:57,687 --> 00:01:01,157
We need a way to take out the base ship
before we can attempt a rescue.

11
00:01:01,607 --> 00:01:04,917
If you go back to Caprica
and bring me the arrow...

12
00:01:06,007 --> 00:01:07,838
I will show us the way.

13
00:01:07,927 --> 00:01:09,485
What are you doing, Starbuck?

14
00:01:09,567 --> 00:01:11,842
<i>Galactica. Apollo. She just jumped away.</i>

15
00:01:11,927 --> 00:01:15,237
- Where the hell did she go?
- Home.

16
00:01:26,527 --> 00:01:28,916
This is it! Now, come on!

17
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:32,363
Now come on! Everybody up!

18
00:01:32,447 --> 00:01:34,722
Come on! Go!

19
00:01:34,847 --> 00:01:37,281
Come on, move! Out!

20
00:01:38,047 --> 00:01:40,436
Come on, get him out of the chair.

21
00:01:41,567 --> 00:01:43,762
Look at me.
I got him!

22
00:01:43,847 --> 00:01:46,077
For gods' sakes, hurry!
Come on!

23
00:01:46,167 --> 00:01:48,681
I got his legs.
I got him!

24
00:01:48,767 --> 00:01:50,962
Put him on your shoulder.

25
00:01:53,287 --> 00:01:56,120
Doc! Come on, Doc!

26
00:01:59,287 --> 00:02:00,800
Crash!

27
00:02:02,207 --> 00:02:03,560
Doc!

28
00:02:08,927 --> 00:02:10,679
Take my hand.

29
00:02:13,047 --> 00:02:15,242
Gaius, take my hand.

30
00:02:29,767 --> 00:02:32,679
Hey, come on!
Wake up! Stay with me! We gotta go!

31
00:02:32,767 --> 00:02:34,120
Stay with me, Doc! Come on!

32
00:02:34,207 --> 00:02:36,675
Come on! Bring him outside!
It's gonna blow!

33
00:02:40,447 --> 00:02:41,766
Get down!

34
00:02:51,367 --> 00:02:52,925
Stay down.

35
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:55,523
How's he? You okay?

36
00:02:56,287 --> 00:02:59,836
We got full tanks. Let's see what we get.
Getting them down.

37
00:03:05,127 --> 00:03:06,401
You all right? You okay?

38
00:03:06,487 --> 00:03:08,523
Get the supplies
before they burn. Go.

39
00:03:08,607 --> 00:03:09,676
Right away.

40
00:03:09,767 --> 00:03:12,804
We crashed both tanks.
The gas is gone. It's all gone.

41
00:04:41,767 --> 00:04:43,803
It's a museum. So what?

42
00:04:44,607 --> 00:04:47,758
It's more than that.
It's the home of the arrow of Apollo.

43
00:04:48,407 --> 00:04:52,116
What the hell is that?
You never liked history.

44
00:04:52,207 --> 00:04:56,598
Come on, Helo. It's supposed to be
the only clue as to the location of Earth.

45
00:04:56,847 --> 00:04:59,486
Earth? What are you talking about?

46
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:02,525
Who's going to Earth? It doesn't even exist.

47
00:05:02,607 --> 00:05:05,326
<i>I'm trying to get back to Galactica.</i>

48
00:05:05,927 --> 00:05:09,237
What I need from you is a way off this planet,
and a way back to my ship.

49
00:05:09,327 --> 00:05:11,443
If you don't do that, I'll blow your head off.

50
00:05:11,527 --> 00:05:13,438
Why don't you just shut up for a change?

51
00:05:13,527 --> 00:05:16,166
You're only alive because I've kept you alive.

52
00:05:16,247 --> 00:05:18,363
If it wasn't for me, you'd be dead by now.

53
00:05:18,687 --> 00:05:22,236
So whether you like it or not,
I'm your only hope of getting off this planet.

54
00:05:22,327 --> 00:05:26,559
So if I were you, I'd take that tough guy
attitude of yours and shove it up your ass.

55
00:05:29,407 --> 00:05:31,762
We can't move around the city
during daylight.

56
00:05:31,847 --> 00:05:34,077
So we hole up and we wait till dark.

57
00:05:49,887 --> 00:05:51,320
Unbelievable.

58
00:05:51,807 --> 00:05:54,924
She's crossed the line before,
but this is so far beyond the pale...

59
00:05:55,007 --> 00:05:57,760
She wouldn't have done this on her own.
She was coerced.

60
00:05:58,287 --> 00:06:01,723
No one coerces Starbuck.
Believe me, I've tried.

61
00:06:02,847 --> 00:06:06,157
Commander, I have the President on the line.

62
00:06:07,007 --> 00:06:09,475
Bear witness. Put on your headset.

63
00:06:14,927 --> 00:06:19,523
<i>Madam President, moments ago,
Lt. Thrace took the Cylon Raider...</i>

64
00:06:19,607 --> 00:06:23,236
<i>- on an unscheduled and unauthorised jump.
- Yes.</i>

65
00:06:23,767 --> 00:06:26,281
Do you have any knowledge of this incident?

66
00:06:26,367 --> 00:06:30,042
Let's save some time here, Commander.
The question you really want to ask me...

67
00:06:30,127 --> 00:06:33,597
is whether or not I asked Lt. Thrace
to take the Raider to Caprica.

68
00:06:33,847 --> 00:06:36,759
<i>The answer to your question is yes.</i>

69
00:06:39,927 --> 00:06:42,999
- You and I had talked about this.
- Yes, we had.

70
00:06:43,167 --> 00:06:46,443
<i>We both decided
it was a military decision.</i>

71
00:06:48,247 --> 00:06:51,717
My responsibility as President
is first and foremost...

72
00:06:51,807 --> 00:06:54,799
to protect and preserve
this fleet and its future.

73
00:06:54,887 --> 00:06:58,436
<i>In the end, that outweighs
any other consideration. It has to.</i>

74
00:06:58,527 --> 00:07:00,279
By taking the Raider...

75
00:07:00,367 --> 00:07:04,042
you've placed our people
on the surface of Kobol in direct danger.

76
00:07:04,327 --> 00:07:08,286
I'm very aware of the danger
our men and women are in on Kobol.

77
00:07:08,407 --> 00:07:11,877
I am also deeply aware of the danger
this civilisation will be in...

78
00:07:11,967 --> 00:07:14,879
if I ignore the pursuit of this arrow.

79
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:25,600
I'm going to have to ask you
for your resignation, Madam President.

80
00:07:25,687 --> 00:07:27,086
<i>No.</i>

81
00:07:28,367 --> 00:07:31,882
Then I'm terminating your presidency
as of this moment.

82
00:07:33,127 --> 00:07:37,564
Commander Adama,
I will exercise the authority of this office...

83
00:07:37,647 --> 00:07:39,046
until I am unable to do so.

84
00:07:39,127 --> 00:07:42,244
So if you want to stage a coup...

85
00:07:42,327 --> 00:07:44,682
you're gonna have to come over here
and arrest me.

86
00:07:44,767 --> 00:07:48,396
- I don't want any bloodshed.
- Of course you don't. Neither do I.

87
00:07:48,487 --> 00:07:52,844
Neither does the press.
They're here, by the way.

88
00:07:53,167 --> 00:07:55,123
The press.

89
00:07:55,327 --> 00:07:57,761
They're recording every minute.

90
00:08:18,407 --> 00:08:20,523
<i>- What is it, Captain?
- Isolate Colonial One.</i>

91
00:08:20,607 --> 00:08:21,642
Mr. Gaeta.

92
00:08:21,727 --> 00:08:24,366
<i>Jam any transmissions
in or out of Colonial One immediately.</i>

93
00:08:24,447 --> 00:08:26,836
- Yes, sir.
- Prepare a strike team.

94
00:08:27,087 --> 00:08:29,317
As long as she's President, she's dangerous.

95
00:08:29,407 --> 00:08:32,365
<i>If she can turn Starbuck against us,
she's capable of anything.</i>

96
00:08:32,447 --> 00:08:33,482
Yes, sir.

97
00:08:33,567 --> 00:08:35,842
- She's bluffing.
- Well, let's hope so.

98
00:08:35,927 --> 00:08:39,283
There's also a Cylon base ship out there
to deal with.

99
00:08:39,527 --> 00:08:40,960
Leave that to me.

100
00:08:41,207 --> 00:08:45,564
This government survived a Cylon attack.
It will survive William Adama.

101
00:08:45,647 --> 00:08:47,239
I think he's bluffing.

102
00:08:48,407 --> 00:08:51,240
But just in case, we need to be prepared.

103
00:08:52,087 --> 00:08:54,840
I know their security detail.
They will defend that ship.

104
00:08:54,927 --> 00:08:57,441
We'll have to take her down
compartment by compartment.

105
00:08:57,527 --> 00:08:58,846
Mr. Gaeta?
Sir.

106
00:08:58,927 --> 00:09:01,964
Am I correct in assuming
that I have two Cylon transponders left?

107
00:09:02,047 --> 00:09:04,766
Yes, sir. But only one of them
is fully functional.

108
00:09:04,847 --> 00:09:06,246
One will do.

109
00:09:07,087 --> 00:09:08,839
Now I need a pilot.

110
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:14,522
Sir.
As you were.

111
00:09:17,527 --> 00:09:21,042
- How are you feeling?
- It looks worse than it is, sir.

112
00:09:22,087 --> 00:09:25,204
Things are moving very quickly
and I need every pilot.

113
00:09:25,287 --> 00:09:27,118
I'm ready, sir.

114
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:31,277
I have a very special mission for you
and I won't kid around.

115
00:09:31,367 --> 00:09:34,757
- It's high risk, extremely high risk.
- I understand.

116
00:09:34,847 --> 00:09:38,601
I need you to light-jump to Kobol
and take care of this base star.

117
00:09:39,887 --> 00:09:43,038
We're placing a Cylon transponder
aboard your Raptor.

118
00:09:43,127 --> 00:09:47,757
In theory, it should allow you to approach
the base star without getting fired upon.

119
00:09:47,847 --> 00:09:52,204
<i>But we'll still be ID'd as Colonial Raptors
once we're in visual range.</i>

120
00:09:52,327 --> 00:09:55,125
For all they know,
you could be two Cylon agents...

121
00:09:55,207 --> 00:09:57,482
returning with a captured Raptor.

122
00:09:58,327 --> 00:10:01,160
Once you're inside
the defence perimeter...

123
00:10:01,647 --> 00:10:04,719
I need you to make them think
you want to dock.

124
00:10:05,527 --> 00:10:09,281
You have to fire your nuke
into the loading bay...

125
00:10:10,327 --> 00:10:13,683
and then jump back home immediately.
Do you understand?

126
00:10:14,407 --> 00:10:15,886
I understand.

127
00:10:16,687 --> 00:10:18,996
I can do it, sir. I know I can.

128
00:10:20,367 --> 00:10:21,800
You have to.

129
00:10:25,007 --> 00:10:26,645
Yes, sir.

130
00:11:00,207 --> 00:11:02,084
This doesn't look good.

131
00:11:02,487 --> 00:11:05,479
Please tell me this was not all for nothing.

132
00:11:16,247 --> 00:11:17,646
I'm good.

133
00:11:18,727 --> 00:11:20,399
I am really good.

134
00:11:23,247 --> 00:11:24,805
I'm home.

135
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,206
Wow, I'm home.

136
00:11:38,647 --> 00:11:43,038
Gaeta, please tell me that you're right
about this transponder thing.

137
00:12:11,727 --> 00:12:13,683
Stop. Stop that.

138
00:12:15,087 --> 00:12:16,236
I'm nervous.

139
00:12:17,847 --> 00:12:19,724
Like anything scares you.

140
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:22,605
Things scare me, Helo. I have feelings.

141
00:12:22,687 --> 00:12:24,564
You have software.

142
00:12:26,967 --> 00:12:29,720
I don't know
if you can hear this or not, Helo...

143
00:12:29,807 --> 00:12:34,756
but what we had between us was important.
It was very important.

144
00:12:36,367 --> 00:12:39,279
- Why?
- Because it was the next step.

145
00:12:40,287 --> 00:12:42,357
Because it brings us closer to God.

146
00:12:42,447 --> 00:12:46,759
Don't mock the gods. It's a human belief.
I'm human. They're our gods.

147
00:12:47,647 --> 00:12:52,562
But beyond that, I just want you to know
that I genuinely feel something for you.

148
00:12:57,647 --> 00:12:59,080
I don't care.

149
00:12:59,927 --> 00:13:01,679
I don't love you.

150
00:13:03,007 --> 00:13:05,362
I loved what I thought was you.

151
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:11,918
Helo, I think there's something
else that you should know.

152
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:16,044
I'm pregnant.

153
00:13:22,247 --> 00:13:25,922
<i>Galactica, Apollo.
We have visual on Colonial One.</i>

154
00:13:27,247 --> 00:13:29,602
Tell Apollo he's cleared
to begin the assault...

155
00:13:29,687 --> 00:13:32,884
to contact us when he has soft-seal
on the hull.

156
00:13:33,807 --> 00:13:35,081
Aye, sir.

157
00:13:35,207 --> 00:13:40,042
Commander, Boomer and Racetrack
are in the air, ready for their jump to Kobol.

158
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:43,483
Put them through down here.

159
00:13:46,767 --> 00:13:48,758
<i>Boomer, Galactica Actual.</i>

160
00:13:49,327 --> 00:13:51,795
<i>I just wanted to say good luck,
good hunting...</i>

161
00:13:51,887 --> 00:13:53,923
<i>and I have complete faith in the both of you.</i>

162
00:13:54,007 --> 00:13:56,760
Thank you, Actual. We won't let you down.

163
00:13:57,567 --> 00:13:59,922
Racetrack, start the jump clock.

164
00:14:02,807 --> 00:14:04,035
Clock is running.

165
00:14:10,527 --> 00:14:13,439
<i>Galactica. Apollo.
We have soft-seal.</i>

166
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:16,647
I know Commander Adama
and I'm counting on the fact...

167
00:14:16,727 --> 00:14:19,195
that when push comes to shove,
he is the kind of man...

168
00:14:19,287 --> 00:14:21,437
who will not want bloodshed.

169
00:14:22,047 --> 00:14:25,278
Nevertheless, this may not be
the safest place.

170
00:14:25,927 --> 00:14:28,919
Billy, how many civilians
are in the cargo hold?

171
00:14:29,087 --> 00:14:30,566
176.

172
00:14:31,247 --> 00:14:34,842
There is room in the cargo hold
and I implore you to find refuge there...

173
00:14:34,927 --> 00:14:37,805
with the other civilians. This is my choice.

174
00:14:38,727 --> 00:14:40,399
This is my choice.

175
00:14:42,367 --> 00:14:46,360
- You do not have to come with me.
- We stand with our president.

176
00:14:55,207 --> 00:14:56,686
Yes?

177
00:14:59,407 --> 00:15:00,806
Right.

178
00:15:03,767 --> 00:15:08,158
Security commander reports sounds
of someone cutting through the hull.

179
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:16,359
The Raptors are cutting through the hull, sir.

180
00:15:17,407 --> 00:15:19,716
Get the President on the line.

181
00:16:38,127 --> 00:16:40,436
You think this thing is working?

182
00:16:42,287 --> 00:16:44,403
We're about to find out.

183
00:17:04,247 --> 00:17:07,319
- I guess so.
- Yeah.

184
00:17:21,127 --> 00:17:23,846
- How are we doing on that?
- It's not responding, sir.

185
00:17:23,927 --> 00:17:26,600
Are you even trained to use this thing?

186
00:17:28,607 --> 00:17:30,518
How's he doing, Chief?

187
00:17:36,447 --> 00:17:39,200
Not doing so good. I don't now
if his lungs are burned or what.

188
00:17:39,287 --> 00:17:42,563
Well, he's a tough kid.
He's gonna pull through.

189
00:17:43,247 --> 00:17:45,283
Get those wounds looked at, Chief.

190
00:17:45,367 --> 00:17:47,483
Yeah. Lieutenant?

191
00:17:52,407 --> 00:17:54,796
Shouldn't we be moving out?

192
00:17:54,887 --> 00:17:58,800
- Do you have a plan for tactical deployment?
- Plan for tactical deployment, Chief?

193
00:17:58,887 --> 00:18:02,880
Get to the high ground. It'll be our best
chance of being seen by a search party.

194
00:18:02,967 --> 00:18:06,164
High ground is also our best chance
of being seen by the Cylons.

195
00:18:06,327 --> 00:18:09,160
They're flying around, sir.
They might land the troops...

196
00:18:09,247 --> 00:18:11,317
before we get rescued.

197
00:18:12,887 --> 00:18:15,401
That's true.
Yeah.

198
00:18:16,607 --> 00:18:18,040
Sir, if I may...

199
00:18:18,127 --> 00:18:21,244
suggest that we take cover on the ground...

200
00:18:21,327 --> 00:18:23,363
maybe somewhere
we won't be seen from the air?

201
00:18:23,447 --> 00:18:25,722
Okay, yeah. Chief, that's...

202
00:18:26,487 --> 00:18:28,682
Carry on, Chief.

203
00:18:49,807 --> 00:18:52,401
Launch the nuke and prepare to jump.

204
00:18:55,647 --> 00:18:56,966
Frack.

205
00:18:57,927 --> 00:18:59,076
What?

206
00:18:59,407 --> 00:19:02,365
The bomb release is jammed. I can't free it.

207
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:17,882
We can dock inside the ship.

208
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:22,440
- Excuse me?
- They think we're Cylons. They'll let us dock.

209
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:27,360
We can release the bomb manually
and drop the nuke inside the ship itself.

210
00:19:28,527 --> 00:19:30,597
- It'll work. I know it.
- Oh, my gods.

211
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,086
Petard, Felix?

212
00:19:53,607 --> 00:19:56,883
Wanna give me a hand here, please?
Yes, sir.

213
00:19:56,967 --> 00:19:59,117
Cally, how's he doing?
Not good, sir.

214
00:19:59,207 --> 00:20:01,516
Get a blanket on him.
Keep him warm.

215
00:20:01,607 --> 00:20:03,120
How are you?

216
00:20:07,007 --> 00:20:08,884
Alive.

217
00:20:11,887 --> 00:20:13,445
You saved me.

218
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,758
You saved my life.

219
00:20:19,727 --> 00:20:23,322
- Care to return the favour?
- Are you in need of saving?

220
00:20:24,847 --> 00:20:27,407
You wondered why you were chosen?

221
00:20:27,807 --> 00:20:32,358
Why God chose you above all other humans
to survive and serve His purpose?

222
00:20:33,727 --> 00:20:36,082
Now is the time to find out why.

223
00:21:23,607 --> 00:21:25,837
Lords of Kobol, hear our prayer.

224
00:21:25,927 --> 00:21:28,487
Bring us out of the darkness
and into the light.

225
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:31,400
Give us the strength to show mercy
to those who are merciless...

226
00:21:31,487 --> 00:21:33,079
The President says she will not yield.

227
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:34,885
...hearts that they may find peace...

228
00:21:35,167 --> 00:21:37,840
The President says she will not yield.

229
00:21:39,847 --> 00:21:41,121
So be it.

230
00:21:47,207 --> 00:21:50,517
Come on, D,
tell me he's not actually gonna do this.

231
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:53,122
Tell me she's not gonna
make him do it.

232
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:56,605
Redeem our hearts that they may find peace
in the midst of war.

233
00:21:58,407 --> 00:21:59,635
What's going on?

234
00:21:59,927 --> 00:22:01,440
They're in.

235
00:22:02,807 --> 00:22:04,365
Quickly.

236
00:22:09,567 --> 00:22:10,761
Billy?

237
00:22:12,767 --> 00:22:14,166
Billy?

238
00:22:17,527 --> 00:22:19,961
Sir, they're in.

239
00:23:20,207 --> 00:23:21,879
Pretty, isn't it?

240
00:23:24,727 --> 00:23:26,445
Hello, Lieutenant.

241
00:23:26,727 --> 00:23:28,843
Something I can help you with?

242
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:24,683
I'm setting her down.

243
00:24:44,927 --> 00:24:46,519
Open the hatch.

244
00:24:51,087 --> 00:24:53,123
I'll release the bomb.

245
00:24:53,407 --> 00:24:56,160
Keep the engines ready for takeoff
the second I get back.

246
00:24:56,247 --> 00:24:58,442
- Yes, sir.
- Close the hatch after me.

247
00:24:58,687 --> 00:25:01,599
- If I'm not back in five minutes, just go.
- You got it.

248
00:25:39,327 --> 00:25:40,726
Oh, my God.

249
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:01,486
Welcome back to Caprica, Lieutenant.

250
00:26:01,567 --> 00:26:04,127
<i>Like what we've done with the place?</i>

251
00:27:19,967 --> 00:27:21,286
<i>Sharon.</i>

252
00:27:33,487 --> 00:27:36,524
What the frack are you doing?
Where are you going?

253
00:27:36,607 --> 00:27:38,563
Son of a bitch.

254
00:27:39,687 --> 00:27:41,996
Okay, okay.

255
00:28:03,607 --> 00:28:05,563
<i>Sharon.</i>

256
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:25,999
This isn't happening.

257
00:28:26,487 --> 00:28:28,284
Come on, Starbuck.

258
00:28:50,927 --> 00:28:52,599
Got anything left?

259
00:29:35,167 --> 00:29:36,600
Starbuck?

260
00:29:43,767 --> 00:29:45,917
Madam President,
no one needs to get hurt here.

261
00:29:46,007 --> 00:29:48,475
Then why don't you get off my ship,
Colonel?

262
00:29:48,927 --> 00:29:51,157
I'm placing you under arrest.

263
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:05,164
- No. We're not doing this.
- I'm in command here, Captain.

264
00:30:05,247 --> 00:30:08,205
- Colonel, this is wrong.
- You're relieved. Fall back.

265
00:30:08,287 --> 00:30:09,766
Madam President, I wish to...

266
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:14,037
Men, lay down your weapons.
Have you lost your fracking mind?

267
00:30:14,127 --> 00:30:16,357
Colonel, tell these Marines to fall back.

268
00:30:19,287 --> 00:30:22,006
This is mutiny. You know that.
Yes, I do.

269
00:30:22,087 --> 00:30:24,885
But you can tell my father
I'm listening to my instincts.

270
00:30:24,967 --> 00:30:27,640
And my instincts tell me
we cannot sacrifice our democracy...

271
00:30:27,727 --> 00:30:30,400
just because the President
makes a bad decision.

272
00:30:36,727 --> 00:30:38,479
Put your guns down.

273
00:30:40,167 --> 00:30:43,045
- Madam President, stand back.
- Put your gun down, Captain.

274
00:30:43,127 --> 00:30:46,597
I will not have bloodshed,
neither your men nor my people...

275
00:30:46,687 --> 00:30:49,963
<i>on the Colonial One.
Put your gun down. All of you.</i>

276
00:30:52,927 --> 00:30:55,043
Please, put your gun down.

277
00:30:58,647 --> 00:31:00,319
Let's go.

278
00:31:02,287 --> 00:31:04,005
Let's go, Captain.

279
00:31:13,487 --> 00:31:14,806
Let's go.

280
00:31:27,447 --> 00:31:29,961
You're confused. And scared.

281
00:31:31,007 --> 00:31:32,599
But it's okay.

282
00:31:39,887 --> 00:31:41,684
I'm not a Cylon.

283
00:31:42,527 --> 00:31:45,758
I'm Sharon Valerii. I was born on Troy.

284
00:31:46,127 --> 00:31:49,722
My parents were
Katherine and Abraham Valerii.

285
00:31:51,727 --> 00:31:55,322
You can't fight destiny, Sharon.
It catches up with you.

286
00:31:55,407 --> 00:31:57,159
No matter what you do.

287
00:31:58,647 --> 00:32:01,719
Don't worry about us.
We'll see you again.

288
00:32:02,767 --> 00:32:05,998
- We love you, Sharon.
- And we always will.

289
00:32:14,607 --> 00:32:16,757
Boomer!
Come on, let's go!

290
00:32:17,247 --> 00:32:19,158
What took you so long?
Go!

291
00:32:19,247 --> 00:32:21,203
Where's your helmet?

292
00:32:22,367 --> 00:32:25,040
Go back. Don't turn around.

293
00:32:55,087 --> 00:32:57,157
He put his weapon right to my head.

294
00:32:57,247 --> 00:32:59,841
Said to tell you
he was following his instincts...

295
00:32:59,927 --> 00:33:02,122
whatever the hell that means.

296
00:33:02,767 --> 00:33:05,964
<i>Bring him here.
What about Roslin?</i>

297
00:33:08,967 --> 00:33:11,003
We put her in the brig.

298
00:33:14,447 --> 00:33:17,519
Dradis contacts!
It's Boomer and Racetrack, sir.

299
00:33:17,607 --> 00:33:19,598
Put them on the speakers.

300
00:33:19,927 --> 00:33:22,725
<i>Galactica,
Boomer. Mission accomplished.</i>

301
00:33:22,807 --> 00:33:26,038
<i>Repeat: Mission accomplished.
The base star is history!</i>

302
00:33:32,007 --> 00:33:35,044
There's some good news.
Bring them home, D.

303
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,725
It's good to hear your voice, Boomer.
Come on home.

304
00:33:55,167 --> 00:33:56,805
It's okay.

305
00:33:57,487 --> 00:33:59,318
I can't believe it.

306
00:33:59,887 --> 00:34:02,526
You are like the last person
I expected to see.

307
00:34:04,287 --> 00:34:06,243
I could say the same thing about you.

308
00:34:09,167 --> 00:34:11,476
- You okay?
- Yeah, thank you.

309
00:34:22,447 --> 00:34:24,278
I missed you.

310
00:34:37,127 --> 00:34:38,765
Hey, I...

311
00:34:40,927 --> 00:34:43,680
She's a Cylon!
No!

312
00:34:44,367 --> 00:34:47,245
You can't! She's pregnant.

313
00:34:55,767 --> 00:34:57,439
No!

314
00:35:18,487 --> 00:35:21,399
- I know this place.
- Of course you do.

315
00:35:31,327 --> 00:35:32,885
Go inside.

316
00:36:27,807 --> 00:36:29,718
I don't understand.

317
00:36:30,807 --> 00:36:32,843
Life has a melody, Gaius.

318
00:36:33,967 --> 00:36:36,322
A rhythm of notes
that become your existence...

319
00:36:36,407 --> 00:36:39,126
once they're played in harmony
with God's plan.

320
00:36:40,887 --> 00:36:44,197
It's time to do your part
and realise your destiny.

321
00:36:44,887 --> 00:36:46,525
Which is what, exactly?

322
00:36:46,607 --> 00:36:51,203
You are the guardian and protector
of the new generation of God's children.

323
00:36:53,927 --> 00:36:57,681
The first member of our family
will be with us soon, Gaius.

324
00:36:59,367 --> 00:37:01,597
It's time to make your choice.

325
00:37:02,407 --> 00:37:05,001
But I don't understand
what you're talking about.

326
00:37:05,087 --> 00:37:06,486
I don't understand.

327
00:37:06,567 --> 00:37:10,116
Come. See the face
of the shape of things to come.

328
00:37:26,047 --> 00:37:28,163
Isn't she beautiful, Gaius?

329
00:37:58,687 --> 00:38:00,359
Open the cell.

330
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:11,445
Close the cell.

331
00:38:25,807 --> 00:38:28,321
Well done, Lieutenant.
Thanks.

332
00:38:32,927 --> 00:38:35,600
Hey, nice work.
Thanks. What's going on?

333
00:38:36,367 --> 00:38:38,927
A lot happened
while you were gone.

334
00:38:39,167 --> 00:38:41,397
Congrats.
Thanks.

335
00:39:07,007 --> 00:39:09,316
Congratulations to both of you.

336
00:39:10,647 --> 00:39:13,559
You carried out a very difficult
and dangerous mission...

337
00:39:14,487 --> 00:39:15,886
and you did it...

338
00:39:15,967 --> 00:39:19,642
despite any personal misgivings
you may or may not have had.

339
00:39:20,327 --> 00:39:22,557
<i>And for that, I'm very proud.</i>

340
00:39:23,647 --> 00:39:25,922
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.

341
00:39:26,127 --> 00:39:27,526
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

342
00:40:11,247 --> 00:40:13,715
Someone get a doctor!

343
00:40:15,447 --> 00:40:17,005
Hold his head.
