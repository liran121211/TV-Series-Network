1
00:00:01,287 --> 00:00:03,755
<i>Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.</i>

2
00:00:04,247 --> 00:00:05,760
Now you tell me you're a machine.

3
00:00:05,847 --> 00:00:06,916
The robot.

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,646
You knew I wanted access
to defence mainframe.

5
00:00:09,727 --> 00:00:12,844
Do you have any idea
what they'd do to me if they find out?

6
00:00:12,927 --> 00:00:14,121
Get down.

7
00:00:15,567 --> 00:00:17,876
<i>Moments ago,
this ship received word...</i>

8
00:00:17,967 --> 00:00:21,277
<i>that the Cylon attack
against our home worlds is underway.</i>

9
00:00:21,367 --> 00:00:24,325
As of this moment, we are at war.

10
00:00:24,407 --> 00:00:26,602
All right, we can take three more people.

11
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:28,001
Giving up my seat.

12
00:00:33,527 --> 00:00:36,485
I've decided you're an expression
of my subconscious mind...

13
00:00:36,567 --> 00:00:38,876
playing itself out during my waking states.

14
00:00:38,967 --> 00:00:41,401
So I'm in your head?

15
00:00:44,247 --> 00:00:45,282
No.

16
00:00:45,367 --> 00:00:48,200
There're maybe Cylon agents
living among us.

17
00:00:48,287 --> 00:00:50,437
Some may not even know
they're Cylons at all.

18
00:00:50,527 --> 00:00:52,006
<i>They could be sleeper agents...</i>

19
00:00:52,087 --> 00:00:56,205
programmed to perfectly impersonate
human beings until activation.

20
00:01:29,367 --> 00:01:31,278
And one minute to mark.

21
00:02:18,407 --> 00:02:22,844
God has a plan for you, Gaius.
He has a plan for everything and everyone.

22
00:02:28,567 --> 00:02:31,127
Gaius? Are you even listening to me?

23
00:02:36,327 --> 00:02:38,204
<i>Passengers, 30 seconds to mark.</i>

24
00:02:38,287 --> 00:02:41,359
Planet. Men. Women. Age.

25
00:02:41,447 --> 00:02:44,166
You know what? Do this after the jump.
It's all right.

26
00:02:58,007 --> 00:03:00,396
You have to believe in something.

27
00:03:02,127 --> 00:03:05,244
I believe in a world
that I can and do understand.

28
00:03:05,327 --> 00:03:09,002
A rational universe.
Explained through rational means.

29
00:03:15,447 --> 00:03:18,598
I love you. That's not rational.

30
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:22,195
I know.

31
00:03:23,847 --> 00:03:27,123
No, but you're not rational.

32
00:03:29,967 --> 00:03:32,162
You're also not really here.

33
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:34,846
Neither am I.

34
00:03:36,607 --> 00:03:38,598
<i>Madam President,
ladies and gentlemen...</i>

35
00:03:38,687 --> 00:03:40,803
<i>our 33 minutes are almost up once again.</i>

36
00:03:41,007 --> 00:03:43,840
<i>Please prepare for our faster-than-light jump.
Thank you.</i>

37
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,445
Cutting it a little close this time,
aren't we, Billy?

38
00:03:53,527 --> 00:03:56,405
Pilot says he's had to reboot
the FTL computer again.

39
00:04:00,487 --> 00:04:02,955
Why do the Cylons come
every 33 minutes?

40
00:04:03,047 --> 00:04:04,878
Why isn't it 34, 35...

41
00:04:04,967 --> 00:04:06,480
Cally.
What?

42
00:04:07,727 --> 00:04:09,046
Shut up.

43
00:04:12,487 --> 00:04:13,886
Fifteen seconds.

44
00:04:15,647 --> 00:04:19,117
Sir, Jump 237 underway.
Fifty-three ships have jumped.

45
00:04:19,207 --> 00:04:21,721
Ten still reporting trouble
with their FTL drives...

46
00:04:21,807 --> 00:04:23,320
<i>including Colonial One.</i>

47
00:04:23,927 --> 00:04:25,724
We're getting slower.

48
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:29,605
Maybe this time.

49
00:04:51,487 --> 00:04:53,000
Dradis contact.

50
00:04:53,287 --> 00:04:54,436
<i>It's the Cylons.</i>

51
00:04:55,607 --> 00:04:58,405
- Damn it.
- Not this time, maybe the next.

52
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:01,759
Got another idea for the next cycle.

53
00:05:01,847 --> 00:05:04,998
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm afraid the Cylons have appeared again.</i>

54
00:05:05,087 --> 00:05:09,205
<i>However, our FTL drive is now working
and we will jump momentarily.</i>

55
00:05:10,447 --> 00:05:12,119
Five days now.

56
00:05:16,447 --> 00:05:18,199
There are limits...

57
00:05:18,967 --> 00:05:21,435
to the human body, the human mind.

58
00:05:22,207 --> 00:05:24,846
Tolerances that you can't push beyond.

59
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,158
Well, those are facts...

60
00:05:30,087 --> 00:05:31,645
provable facts.

61
00:05:34,007 --> 00:05:35,804
Everyone has a limit.

62
00:05:36,447 --> 00:05:39,439
All right, you know the drill, people.
Scatter formation.

63
00:05:39,527 --> 00:05:43,236
<i>Keep them off the civies
and don't stray beyond the recovery line.</i>

64
00:05:47,327 --> 00:05:51,479
Watch the ammo hoists for the main guns.
You've got a red light right there.

65
00:05:55,287 --> 00:05:58,962
We have a hit on the starboard
bow. Away the damage control parties.

66
00:05:59,047 --> 00:06:01,117
Basestar is launching raiders.

67
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,197
<i>Colonial One is ready to jump.</i>

68
00:06:18,727 --> 00:06:21,082
<i>All civilian ships away,
including Colonial One.</i>

69
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:23,397
Recover fighters. Stand by to jump.

70
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,966
Combat landings.

71
00:06:31,687 --> 00:06:34,440
- All fighters aboard, sir.
- Execute jump.

72
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:54,039
Jump 237 complete.

73
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,846
All civilian ships
present and accounted for, sir.

74
00:06:58,927 --> 00:07:00,645
Start the clock.

75
00:07:00,727 --> 00:07:03,446
<i>And let's start prepping for the next jump.</i>

76
00:07:03,527 --> 00:07:06,405
Clock is running. Thirty-three minutes.

77
00:07:07,367 --> 00:07:08,356
Mark.

78
00:07:12,967 --> 00:07:15,083
You have 32 minutes, people.

79
00:07:39,207 --> 00:07:41,243
You know you're not safe.

80
00:07:42,407 --> 00:07:44,079
No, of course not.

81
00:07:44,887 --> 00:07:47,640
The Cylons will follow us again...

82
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:50,886
as they have the last 237 times.

83
00:07:53,647 --> 00:07:56,161
You're right, you know.
There are limits.

84
00:07:56,607 --> 00:08:00,316
- Eventually, you'll make a mistake.
- And then you'll kill us all.

85
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:01,636
Yes.

86
00:08:02,367 --> 00:08:03,766
Yes, I know.

87
00:08:05,207 --> 00:08:07,482
But not for another 33 minutes.

88
00:09:36,047 --> 00:09:38,436
I want to try
something new this time.

89
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:47,484
Divide the fleet into six groups.

90
00:09:49,327 --> 00:09:50,521
And they jump...

91
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:55,676
And they jump two more times
and on the fourth jump, we rendezvous at...

92
00:09:55,767 --> 00:09:57,917
a common set of coordinates.

93
00:09:59,327 --> 00:10:03,002
Twenty-four jumps to plot,
we're breaking our humps...

94
00:10:03,087 --> 00:10:06,159
calculating one jump every 33 minutes.

95
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:08,805
Get off my jacket.

96
00:10:08,887 --> 00:10:11,162
- You eating this?
- Not anymore.

97
00:10:13,087 --> 00:10:17,160
Combat landings expected again
to be the order of the day...

98
00:10:19,047 --> 00:10:21,800
so double-check
your undercarriage before...

99
00:10:27,007 --> 00:10:30,238
Look, you all have done this 237 times.

100
00:10:32,127 --> 00:10:33,879
<i>You know what to do.</i>

101
00:10:34,727 --> 00:10:36,160
No mistakes.

102
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,997
And let's make it to 238.

103
00:10:41,327 --> 00:10:43,841
Good luck and be careful out there.

104
00:11:02,967 --> 00:11:06,357
Can you do me a favour?
Tell Capt. Apollo he owes me one wing.

105
00:11:06,447 --> 00:11:08,039
You got it, dude.

106
00:11:09,407 --> 00:11:12,126
No, Cally, there's three. I know there's three.

107
00:11:12,207 --> 00:11:14,562
- Can you check it again for me, please?
- Yeah.

108
00:11:14,647 --> 00:11:17,081
Let's get some of them starting to work.

109
00:11:17,167 --> 00:11:18,805
We'll sleep when we're dead.
Come on.

110
00:11:20,167 --> 00:11:21,395
Boomer.

111
00:11:22,447 --> 00:11:25,519
Heard the latest?
They say Cylons look like us now.

112
00:11:25,607 --> 00:11:29,077
- Primary fuel?
- Primary fuel 2893 KRG.

113
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:32,637
Marine told one of the pilots that
we marooned some guy back on Ragnar...

114
00:11:32,727 --> 00:11:34,922
because they actually thought
that he was a Cylon.

115
00:11:35,007 --> 00:11:37,567
You know what? I don't give a frak.

116
00:11:38,007 --> 00:11:41,966
Red light on the number four thruster.
Go make a visual ID. See if it's blocked.

117
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:44,683
- Right.
- "Right. "

118
00:11:58,207 --> 00:12:00,641
A little rough on your new ECO,
don't you think?

119
00:12:00,727 --> 00:12:02,160
He's not my ECO.

120
00:12:02,247 --> 00:12:06,763
He's some refugee from Triton
that I'm saddled with and I didn't ask you.

121
00:12:10,847 --> 00:12:14,203
- Helo's gone, Sharon.
- I didn't ask you that, either.

122
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:20,361
Sorry.

123
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:27,319
- Colony?
- Saggitaron. How many have you got?

124
00:12:27,407 --> 00:12:30,444
5,251 survivors from Saggitaron, last count.

125
00:12:32,447 --> 00:12:36,122
We can't transmit photos yet.
If you want, you can leave them with us...

126
00:12:36,207 --> 00:12:38,402
or you can put them on the board outside.

127
00:12:38,607 --> 00:12:39,642
Sorry.

128
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:42,802
Thanks.
Next.

129
00:12:46,607 --> 00:12:48,199
Colony?

130
00:13:30,967 --> 00:13:33,720
Update on the headcount,
Madam President.

131
00:13:42,207 --> 00:13:44,004
How did we lose 300?

132
00:13:44,767 --> 00:13:46,997
There were some overcounts...

133
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:51,600
a few deaths from wounds
and a few missing during the last attack.

134
00:14:28,487 --> 00:14:30,762
Do you want children, Gaius?

135
00:14:34,287 --> 00:14:36,755
Let me think about it for a minute.

136
00:14:37,927 --> 00:14:39,076
No.

137
00:14:41,687 --> 00:14:44,599
Procreation is one of God's commandments.

138
00:14:45,127 --> 00:14:46,321
Really?

139
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:50,638
I'm sure some day
if you're a good Cylon he'll reward you...

140
00:14:50,727 --> 00:14:53,719
with a lovely little walking toaster
of your very own.

141
00:14:54,047 --> 00:14:56,959
I want us to have a child, Gaius.

142
00:14:57,087 --> 00:14:58,406
You can't be serious.

143
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:01,676
- It's Dr. Amarak.
- What was that?

144
00:15:08,247 --> 00:15:12,445
I'm so sorry for interrupting you
while you were speaking.

145
00:15:12,727 --> 00:15:14,524
You were just saying?

146
00:15:16,607 --> 00:15:19,679
I was just saying that a Dr. Amarak...

147
00:15:19,967 --> 00:15:23,198
- has requested to speak with the President.
- Dr. Amarak. I see.

148
00:15:24,567 --> 00:15:25,761
You know him?

149
00:15:25,847 --> 00:15:28,077
Have you always been able to multitask
like this?

150
00:15:28,167 --> 00:15:29,441
Yes.

151
00:15:30,407 --> 00:15:33,683
I used to work with him
at the Ministry of Defence.

152
00:15:34,287 --> 00:15:37,802
It says here that
he's uncovered important information...

153
00:15:37,887 --> 00:15:41,197
regarding how the Cylons
were able to defeat colonial defences.

154
00:15:41,287 --> 00:15:43,482
I was always a little worried he was on to us.

155
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,523
Were you going to speak to him?

156
00:15:45,607 --> 00:15:48,167
Perhaps I should speak to him
if you're busy.

157
00:15:48,687 --> 00:15:52,077
I think he wanted to speak directly
with the President.

158
00:15:52,167 --> 00:15:53,725
It sounded urgent.

159
00:15:54,967 --> 00:15:57,117
It must be very important.

160
00:15:58,127 --> 00:16:01,722
Maybe something about a certain traitor
in the President's inner circle?

161
00:16:01,807 --> 00:16:03,684
There's not enough time before we jump.

162
00:16:03,767 --> 00:16:06,565
I want him on board first thing
during the next cycle.

163
00:16:07,287 --> 00:16:08,959
Thank you, Doctor.

164
00:16:11,687 --> 00:16:14,997
- I'd say you have a serious problem.
- If I can help.

165
00:16:21,487 --> 00:16:23,682
He's a strange one, isn't he?

166
00:17:56,087 --> 00:17:58,043
<i>Landing base Team Alpha,
check three.</i>

167
00:17:58,127 --> 00:17:59,401
Can you see it?

168
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:04,682
Twelve more cases of nervous exhaustion.
That makes 61.

169
00:18:05,487 --> 00:18:08,797
Have the docs start pumping them up
with stimulants...

170
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:10,445
and get them back on the line.

171
00:18:10,527 --> 00:18:12,483
Pilots, too.
Fuel report.

172
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:14,762
One out of every three, every other cycle.

173
00:18:14,847 --> 00:18:17,566
That's gonna come back
and bite us on the ass.

174
00:18:17,647 --> 00:18:20,400
We have too much work
and not enough people to do it.

175
00:18:20,487 --> 00:18:21,886
Fuel report.

176
00:18:22,327 --> 00:18:25,285
- I've already signed one of these.
- Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.

177
00:18:25,367 --> 00:18:27,437
Comm traffic two from the President.

178
00:18:27,527 --> 00:18:31,156
- Is this my 10 minutes or this yours?
- Yours. I took 10 last time.

179
00:18:33,247 --> 00:18:35,238
See you guys in combat.

180
00:18:35,487 --> 00:18:37,205
I believe it was your 10 minutes.

181
00:18:37,287 --> 00:18:40,723
If the old man's so tired he can't remember,
then it's his turn.

182
00:18:46,927 --> 00:18:49,919
- You see the note from the XO?
- Yeah, I saw it. No way.

183
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:54,366
Kara, everyone else...
I don't fly with stims.

184
00:18:54,447 --> 00:18:57,120
They blunt your reflexes, your reaction time.

185
00:18:57,767 --> 00:19:02,045
- Come on, Kara, give me a break. Just...
- Why are we arguing about this?

186
00:19:02,127 --> 00:19:03,355
I have no idea.

187
00:19:03,447 --> 00:19:05,358
Neither do I. You're the CAG, act like one.

188
00:19:05,447 --> 00:19:07,677
What the hell does that mean?

189
00:19:07,887 --> 00:19:11,197
It means that you're still acting
like you're everyone's best friend.

190
00:19:11,287 --> 00:19:13,721
We're not friends, you're the CAG.

191
00:19:13,807 --> 00:19:15,479
"Be careful out there"?

192
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:19,526
Our job isn't to be careful,
it's to shoot Cylons out of the frakking sky.

193
00:19:19,607 --> 00:19:21,643
"Good hunting" is what you say.

194
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,525
And now, one of your idiot pilots
is acting like a child...

195
00:19:24,607 --> 00:19:27,599
and refusing to take her pills.
So she either says, "Yes, sir"...

196
00:19:27,687 --> 00:19:30,406
and obeys a direct order
or you smack her in the mouth...

197
00:19:30,487 --> 00:19:34,446
and you drag her sorry ass down to sickbay
and you make her take those pills.

198
00:19:39,567 --> 00:19:42,001
Well, I'm glad I'm not working for you.

199
00:19:43,847 --> 00:19:46,077
You're damn right you're glad.

200
00:19:48,967 --> 00:19:52,357
So, do I have to smack you in the mouth,
Lieutenant?

201
00:19:54,967 --> 00:19:57,117
No, sir. I'll take my pills.

202
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:00,395
Perfect.

203
00:20:02,927 --> 00:20:05,521
- Carry on.
- Yes, sir.

204
00:20:05,887 --> 00:20:09,800
<i>Pilots to ready room
for pre-flight briefing. Pilots to ready room.</i>

205
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:15,162
What?

206
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,918
Jump 238 complete.

207
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:16,599
Start the clock.

208
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,364
<i>Thirty-three minutes.</i>

209
00:21:20,087 --> 00:21:21,315
<i>Mark.</i>

210
00:21:22,607 --> 00:21:24,723
All civilian ships present and...

211
00:21:26,087 --> 00:21:27,600
Strike my last.

212
00:21:27,927 --> 00:21:31,078
One civilian ship
missing and unaccounted for, sir.

213
00:21:31,167 --> 00:21:33,522
<i>Which one?
The Olympic Carrier.</i>

214
00:21:33,607 --> 00:21:36,758
Commercial passenger vessel.
Were they left behind?

215
00:21:36,847 --> 00:21:39,725
I think I accounted
for all civilian ships before we left.

216
00:21:39,807 --> 00:21:42,196
You think? Did you or didn't you?

217
00:21:45,007 --> 00:21:49,125
They're not logged in, sir.
I think they may have been left behind.

218
00:21:49,487 --> 00:21:51,762
How many people aboard ship?

219
00:21:51,847 --> 00:21:55,157
1,345 souls, sir.

220
00:21:57,247 --> 00:22:01,445
You're telling me we left over 1,300 people
to die at the hands of the Cylons?

221
00:22:01,527 --> 00:22:03,518
It may not have been her fault, sir.

222
00:22:03,607 --> 00:22:07,236
It may have been a navigational error
and they jumped to the wrong coordinates...

223
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:09,477
or the Cylons destroyed the ship
before the jump...

224
00:22:09,567 --> 00:22:11,398
Or 50 other things may have happened.

225
00:22:11,487 --> 00:22:14,285
The point is we don't know
what the hell did happen.

226
00:22:19,487 --> 00:22:22,285
Yes, we're tired. Yes, there's no relief.

227
00:22:22,887 --> 00:22:27,324
Yes, the Cylons keep coming after us
time after time...

228
00:22:27,407 --> 00:22:30,843
and yes, we are still expected to do our jobs.

229
00:22:40,167 --> 00:22:42,362
We make mistakes, people die.

230
00:22:45,207 --> 00:22:47,402
There aren't many of us left.

231
00:22:51,567 --> 00:22:52,841
Carry on.

232
00:23:20,967 --> 00:23:24,243
Okay. Next crisis?

233
00:23:28,047 --> 00:23:29,799
- List of calls?
- Yes.

234
00:23:31,487 --> 00:23:34,763
But first, where's the doctor
who's supposed to be on board?

235
00:23:34,847 --> 00:23:36,439
<i>What's his name?</i>

236
00:23:36,527 --> 00:23:38,279
- Dr. Amarak.
- Yes.

237
00:23:40,007 --> 00:23:41,725
<i>Dr. Amarak.</i>

238
00:23:46,767 --> 00:23:47,836
Oh.

239
00:23:49,407 --> 00:23:50,965
<i>He was on the Olympic Carrier.</i>

240
00:23:57,807 --> 00:24:00,275
God is watching out for you, Gaius.

241
00:24:05,007 --> 00:24:07,840
The universe is a vast and complex system.

242
00:24:08,807 --> 00:24:12,356
Coincidental, serendipitous events...

243
00:24:12,447 --> 00:24:14,881
are bound to occur.
Indeed they are to be expected.

244
00:24:14,967 --> 00:24:18,846
- It's part of the pattern, part of the plan.
- Dr. Amarak posed a threat to you.

245
00:24:19,447 --> 00:24:22,564
Now he's gone.
Logic says there's a connection.

246
00:24:24,327 --> 00:24:27,285
A connection, maybe. But not God.

247
00:24:28,887 --> 00:24:32,516
There is no God or gods, singular or plural.

248
00:24:32,607 --> 00:24:35,519
There are no large invisible men,
or women for that matter...

249
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:39,441
in the sky taking a personal interest
in the fortunes of Gaius Baltar.

250
00:24:39,847 --> 00:24:41,326
Be careful.

251
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:44,605
That which God gives, he can also take away.

252
00:24:52,047 --> 00:24:53,366
Fifteen seconds.

253
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,799
Maybe this time.

254
00:25:13,127 --> 00:25:14,401
Dradis?

255
00:25:15,367 --> 00:25:17,039
No enemy contacts.

256
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:20,638
Keep the clock running.

257
00:25:23,127 --> 00:25:24,799
What do you think?

258
00:25:27,927 --> 00:25:29,519
I think we wait.

259
00:26:01,487 --> 00:26:03,284
Get me the President.

260
00:26:09,967 --> 00:26:11,446
Why this time?

261
00:26:13,247 --> 00:26:14,999
Was it something that you did?

262
00:26:15,087 --> 00:26:18,079
We had a new plan,
but we didn't have time to implement it yet.

263
00:26:18,167 --> 00:26:21,318
<i>We lost a ship during the last cycle,
the Olympic Carrier.</i>

264
00:26:21,407 --> 00:26:24,319
Does that have something to do with it?

265
00:26:24,407 --> 00:26:25,999
<i>Possibly.</i>

266
00:26:33,007 --> 00:26:34,565
Are you there?

267
00:26:35,247 --> 00:26:36,885
Yeah, I'm here.

268
00:26:38,647 --> 00:26:42,401
What do we do now, Commander?
I've got people on the verge over here.

269
00:26:43,407 --> 00:26:47,320
We're gonna go to Condition Two.
We have to take advantage of this time...

270
00:26:47,407 --> 00:26:49,841
<i>- and let our people get some rest.
- All right.</i>

271
00:26:50,807 --> 00:26:54,277
And how long do we stay at Condition Two?

272
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:57,515
Until I'm satisfied they're not going to return.

273
00:26:57,847 --> 00:26:59,997
<i>It's a military decision.</i>

274
00:27:00,887 --> 00:27:02,525
It is. I know that.

275
00:27:02,607 --> 00:27:06,282
You're right and I defer to your decision.
And, Commander...

276
00:27:07,847 --> 00:27:09,883
<i>let your men and women...</i>

277
00:27:11,167 --> 00:27:15,604
<i>know how grateful I am
for the job that they are doing, please.</i>

278
00:27:17,727 --> 00:27:19,445
Thank them for me.

279
00:27:20,687 --> 00:27:22,678
<i>Thank you, Madam President.</i>

280
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:24,086
Thank you.

281
00:27:28,727 --> 00:27:31,161
Contact Apollo.

282
00:27:31,247 --> 00:27:34,159
Tell him to set up a combat patrol
around the fleet...

283
00:27:34,247 --> 00:27:37,125
and order his other pilots
to land immediately.

284
00:27:37,647 --> 00:27:39,603
All right, people, you heard the order.

285
00:27:39,687 --> 00:27:43,760
Boomer, Starbuck, form up with me.
We'll fly the first CAP.

286
00:27:44,207 --> 00:27:47,961
<i>I want everyone else
back on Galactica and in their racks.</i>

287
00:27:48,047 --> 00:27:50,845
<i>Three-hour rotation.
Hey, Apollo...</i>

288
00:27:50,927 --> 00:27:53,964
<i>not that I'm not honoured by being chosen
to sit in my cockpit...</i>

289
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,526
<i>for the next three hours but...</i>

290
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:57,165
<i>But why you?</i>

291
00:27:58,007 --> 00:28:00,999
<i>- Take a guess.
- Because I'm on drugs?</i>

292
00:28:01,767 --> 00:28:05,043
You got it.
This patrol is 100% stimulated.

293
00:28:05,407 --> 00:28:06,965
<i>Anyone else feels like...</i>

294
00:28:07,047 --> 00:28:10,039
they've got frakking ants crawling
behind their eyeballs?

295
00:28:10,127 --> 00:28:12,118
<i>How about you, Boomer?</i>

296
00:28:12,207 --> 00:28:15,358
Doc tells me you're holding up
better than anybody in the squadron.

297
00:28:15,447 --> 00:28:17,085
I'm tired like everybody else.

298
00:28:17,167 --> 00:28:19,806
<i>You never seem it.
Because she's a Cylon.</i>

299
00:28:19,887 --> 00:28:22,560
You're gonna make me come over there
and kick your ass.

300
00:28:22,647 --> 00:28:25,320
Okay. Let's set up a patrol here...

301
00:28:25,407 --> 00:28:27,443
before somebody gets hurt.

302
00:28:28,447 --> 00:28:30,961
<i>Follow me.
Copy that, Apollo.</i>

303
00:28:37,887 --> 00:28:41,243
A couple hours rack time
does sound awfully sweet...

304
00:28:41,327 --> 00:28:43,795
right about now.
You deserve it.

305
00:28:45,487 --> 00:28:48,126
Thank you. The truth is...

306
00:28:49,607 --> 00:28:53,520
all this has me feeling
more alive than I have in years.

307
00:28:55,607 --> 00:28:57,199
You look that way, too.

308
00:28:57,287 --> 00:28:59,721
It's good to you
without the cup in your hand.

309
00:28:59,807 --> 00:29:00,956
Don't start.

310
00:29:01,047 --> 00:29:04,039
I know there's a whole lot of people
aboard this ship...

311
00:29:04,127 --> 00:29:06,721
that wish you weren't feeling
as good as you were.

312
00:29:06,807 --> 00:29:09,924
If the crew doesn't hate the XO,
then he's not doing his job.

313
00:29:10,007 --> 00:29:12,885
Besides, got to make the old man look good.

314
00:29:13,527 --> 00:29:15,245
I always look good.

315
00:29:15,527 --> 00:29:18,246
- Did you look in a mirror?
- Seriously...

316
00:29:18,327 --> 00:29:19,646
Sir.

317
00:29:19,727 --> 00:29:22,321
...it's one thing to push a crew,
it's another to break them.

318
00:29:23,527 --> 00:29:27,281
Dradis contact.
Bearing 348, carom 120, one ship.

319
00:29:27,487 --> 00:29:29,318
<i>Getting recognition signal.</i>

320
00:29:29,407 --> 00:29:32,080
<i>Initiating response flash mode.
Alpha, alpha.</i>

321
00:29:32,167 --> 00:29:33,725
<i>It's the Olympic Carrier, sir.</i>

322
00:29:33,807 --> 00:29:36,640
Is that confirmed?
It's confirmed, sir.

323
00:29:41,767 --> 00:29:43,359
Thank the gods.

324
00:29:48,087 --> 00:29:49,725
Action stations.

325
00:29:52,647 --> 00:29:54,956
Put the fleet into Condition One.

326
00:29:55,047 --> 00:29:58,403
<i>I want all Vipers manned and ready,
but keep them in the tubes.</i>

327
00:29:58,487 --> 00:30:00,239
Mr. Gaeta.
Sir?

328
00:30:00,327 --> 00:30:02,636
Restart the clock. Thirty-three minutes.

329
00:30:05,207 --> 00:30:07,402
- Hope you're wrong.
- So do I.

330
00:30:07,487 --> 00:30:09,637
<i>Clock is running.
So do I.</i>

331
00:30:14,487 --> 00:30:17,001
No. It's all wrong.

332
00:30:18,247 --> 00:30:21,557
If they were left behind,
why didn't the Cylons destroy them?

333
00:30:21,647 --> 00:30:23,956
And why are they showing up now?

334
00:30:24,047 --> 00:30:27,039
It's God's punishment for your lack of faith.

335
00:30:27,807 --> 00:30:29,877
That's just great, that is.

336
00:30:30,447 --> 00:30:33,484
A more logical and useful explanation,
please.

337
00:30:34,087 --> 00:30:35,520
All right.

338
00:30:37,007 --> 00:30:40,886
<i>The Olympic Carrier has been infiltrated
by Cylon agents.</i>

339
00:30:43,887 --> 00:30:47,243
They've been tracking the ship all along.

340
00:30:48,967 --> 00:30:50,116
No.

341
00:30:52,327 --> 00:30:54,045
Then that means...

342
00:30:54,407 --> 00:30:57,240
Logically, in order for you to survive...

343
00:30:57,647 --> 00:31:00,036
<i>the Olympic Carrier should be destroyed.</i>

344
00:31:03,687 --> 00:31:05,484
Olympic Carrier...

345
00:31:05,567 --> 00:31:09,242
<i>this is Raptor 478, call sign Boomer.
I have you in visual contact.</i>

346
00:31:09,327 --> 00:31:11,363
<i>Please respond to this channel. Over.</i>

347
00:31:11,447 --> 00:31:15,156
<i>Raptor 478, this is the Olympic Carrier.
We have you in visual contact.</i>

348
00:31:15,247 --> 00:31:18,762
<i>Thank the Lords of Kobol. You don't know
how relieved we are to see you.</i>

349
00:31:18,847 --> 00:31:22,396
<i>Roger that, Olympic Carrier.
Can I ask about your whereabouts?</i>

350
00:31:22,487 --> 00:31:26,275
<i>We had trouble with our FTL drive.
Took us almost three hours to fix.</i>

351
00:31:26,367 --> 00:31:29,325
Have Boomer ask them
how they escaped the Cylons.

352
00:31:29,967 --> 00:31:31,719
<i>Olympic Carrier, Boomer.</i>

353
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:34,685
<i>I've been directed to ask how you escaped
from the Cylons.</i>

354
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:37,679
<i>They were closing in on us
when the rest of you were jumping.</i>

355
00:31:37,767 --> 00:31:39,997
<i>I thought we were goners,
then they just broke off.</i>

356
00:31:40,087 --> 00:31:42,043
<i>Someone must've been watching out for us.</i>

357
00:31:42,127 --> 00:31:44,197
<i>Roger that.
One other thing, Boomer.</i>

358
00:31:44,287 --> 00:31:45,766
<i>I've got a Dr. Amarak on board...</i>

359
00:31:45,847 --> 00:31:48,407
<i>who has an urgent matter to discuss
with the President.</i>

360
00:31:48,487 --> 00:31:51,763
<i>- He's been driving me crazy.
- Can you be more specific?</i>

361
00:31:51,847 --> 00:31:55,078
<i>I can't. He says he knows
something about a traitor in our midst...</i>

362
00:31:55,167 --> 00:31:56,839
<i>and he's unwilling to share more than that.</i>

363
00:31:58,007 --> 00:32:00,043
Madam President, I strongly recommend...

364
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:03,517
that we cut off all wireless communication
with that ship right away.

365
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:05,076
Why?

366
00:32:05,167 --> 00:32:07,806
Look, forgive me for being rude,
but wake up, all right?

367
00:32:07,887 --> 00:32:11,357
<i>The Olympic Carrier is still flying
because the Cylons let them survive.</i>

368
00:32:11,447 --> 00:32:13,517
They've been tracking that ship all along.

369
00:32:13,607 --> 00:32:17,156
- There's probably a Cylon agent aboard now!
- Calm down.

370
00:32:17,887 --> 00:32:19,240
Start over.

371
00:32:19,967 --> 00:32:23,323
Please, Madam President, I implore you.
Listen to me.

372
00:32:23,607 --> 00:32:25,757
Cut off radio communication with that ship...

373
00:32:25,847 --> 00:32:28,884
before they send via broadcast signal
another computer virus...

374
00:32:28,967 --> 00:32:31,845
to affect our ship
shortly before they blow us all up.

375
00:32:33,527 --> 00:32:36,121
Commander Adama, are you on the line?

376
00:32:36,767 --> 00:32:39,679
Cut off the speakers.
Put her through on the line.

377
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:44,479
Yes, Madam President.
And I'm inclined to agree with Dr. Baltar.

378
00:32:46,247 --> 00:32:47,805
Good. So do I.

379
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:50,125
Thank the gods you're with us.

380
00:32:50,207 --> 00:32:52,641
God's got nothing to do with this.

381
00:32:56,687 --> 00:32:58,439
<i>Boomer, Galactica.</i>

382
00:32:58,527 --> 00:33:01,963
<i>Your orders are to jam all transmissions
from the Olympic Carrier.</i>

383
00:33:02,047 --> 00:33:04,515
No further voice contact is authorised.

384
00:33:05,207 --> 00:33:06,959
<i>Roger that, Galactica.</i>

385
00:33:07,047 --> 00:33:09,003
<i>Boomer, Galactica.</i>

386
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:13,126
<i>Orders are to send the Olympic Carrier
the following message by signal light.</i>

387
00:33:13,207 --> 00:33:16,358
Message begins: Maintain present position.

388
00:33:16,447 --> 00:33:19,996
<i>Do not, repeat, do not approach
the fleet until further notice.</i>

389
00:33:20,087 --> 00:33:21,520
<i>Message ends.</i>

390
00:33:23,247 --> 00:33:26,080
I'm getting a bad feeling
about where this is headed.

391
00:33:26,367 --> 00:33:27,561
So am I.

392
00:33:27,647 --> 00:33:30,878
If the ship poses a threat to us,
we have to eliminate that threat.

393
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:40,237
<i>I don't think they got the message, Apollo.</i>

394
00:33:40,327 --> 00:33:44,684
Yeah, I see it. Boomer,
break wireless silence on my authority.

395
00:33:44,767 --> 00:33:47,645
Warn them to stop their engines immediately.

396
00:33:48,087 --> 00:33:51,875
I suggest that we evacuate the passengers,
then destroy the ship.

397
00:33:51,967 --> 00:33:54,276
Solves the problem
if they're tracking the ship.

398
00:33:54,367 --> 00:33:56,642
What if they're tracking
one of the passengers?

399
00:33:56,727 --> 00:33:58,524
Olympic Carrier...

400
00:33:58,607 --> 00:34:02,202
<i>you are ordered to stop your engines
immediately. Acknowledge.</i>

401
00:34:03,967 --> 00:34:07,721
<i>Apollo, they're not responding.
Are you using the same channel?</i>

402
00:34:07,807 --> 00:34:10,367
<i>Yeah,
but suddenly nobody's home.</i>

403
00:34:11,287 --> 00:34:13,642
Starbuck, fire a burst across their bow.

404
00:34:15,807 --> 00:34:17,081
Copy that.

405
00:34:24,647 --> 00:34:28,322
<i>Boomer, let Galactica know we have
a problem out here.</i>

406
00:34:28,807 --> 00:34:31,196
Commander, message from Boomer.

407
00:34:31,287 --> 00:34:33,642
<i>The Olympic Carrier is heading
directly for us, sir.</i>

408
00:34:33,727 --> 00:34:35,718
They're refusing all orders to stop.

409
00:34:49,207 --> 00:34:51,437
<i>Galactica,
they're still not responding...</i>

410
00:34:51,527 --> 00:34:54,519
<i>and continue to head towards the fleet.
Request instructions.</i>

411
00:34:54,607 --> 00:34:58,998
Order the fleet to execute Jump 240.
Get us between that ship and the fleet.

412
00:34:59,087 --> 00:35:03,285
Commander! Dradis contact.
Strike that, multiple Dradis contacts.

413
00:35:04,967 --> 00:35:06,446
It's the Cylons.

414
00:35:12,327 --> 00:35:14,443
<i>The Cylons
are on an intercept course.</i>

415
00:35:14,527 --> 00:35:17,758
They'll be in weapons range
within two minutes.

416
00:35:19,727 --> 00:35:21,479
Radiological alarm!

417
00:35:22,007 --> 00:35:24,441
- Radiological alarm!
- From where?

418
00:35:26,287 --> 00:35:28,960
<i>The Olympic Carrier, sir.
They've got nukes on board.</i>

419
00:35:29,047 --> 00:35:33,723
<i>Madam President, we have to eliminate
the Olympic Carrier immediately.</i>

420
00:35:34,047 --> 00:35:36,720
There are 1,300 people on that ship.

421
00:35:37,127 --> 00:35:40,802
<i>We don't know that.
The Cylons may have captured them already.</i>

422
00:35:40,887 --> 00:35:43,879
She's not going to do it. She has to do it.

423
00:35:44,687 --> 00:35:47,281
- It's not her decision, Gaius.
- No?

424
00:35:48,167 --> 00:35:51,557
It's God's choice.
He wants you to repent.

425
00:35:51,647 --> 00:35:55,526
Look, at this point there's no choice.
It's either them or us.

426
00:35:55,727 --> 00:35:57,524
Repent of your sins...

427
00:35:57,607 --> 00:36:00,565
and accept his true love
and you will be saved.

428
00:36:05,367 --> 00:36:08,962
I repent. Then I'll repent.

429
00:36:12,567 --> 00:36:15,525
I repent.

430
00:36:18,247 --> 00:36:19,396
Do it.

431
00:36:21,687 --> 00:36:23,837
<i>We have new orders.</i>

432
00:36:23,927 --> 00:36:27,806
<i>We're directed to destroy
the Olympic Carrier...</i>

433
00:36:27,887 --> 00:36:29,843
<i>and return to Galactica.</i>

434
00:36:30,927 --> 00:36:32,804
It's a civilian ship.

435
00:36:34,207 --> 00:36:37,005
<i>Yeah, a civilian ship with nukes.</i>

436
00:36:45,087 --> 00:36:48,045
<i>I don't see anybody in there,
do you?</i>

437
00:36:53,327 --> 00:36:57,843
The Cylons will be here any second.
If we're going to do this, then just do it.

438
00:36:57,927 --> 00:36:59,758
Starbuck, form up with me.

439
00:36:59,847 --> 00:37:02,122
<i>We'll make one pass from astern.</i>

440
00:37:03,727 --> 00:37:06,241
<i>Lee, what if you're wrong?</i>

441
00:37:12,047 --> 00:37:13,765
<i>Lee, come on.</i>

442
00:37:17,887 --> 00:37:19,923
Okay, fire on my mark.

443
00:37:20,647 --> 00:37:22,558
No frakking way, Lee.

444
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:25,396
Lee? Come on!

445
00:37:33,567 --> 00:37:34,886
Mark.

446
00:38:23,887 --> 00:38:25,559
Are you alive?

447
00:38:28,967 --> 00:38:30,844
Agathon, Karl C.

448
00:38:30,927 --> 00:38:32,679
Lieutenant, junior grade, Colonial fleet.

449
00:38:32,767 --> 00:38:37,477
- PK-789-9348.
- I know who you are, Helo.

450
00:38:37,567 --> 00:38:39,797
It's all right. I'm a friend.

451
00:38:59,167 --> 00:39:00,361
Sharon?

452
00:39:05,367 --> 00:39:08,677
What are you doing here?
Can you walk?

453
00:39:10,967 --> 00:39:13,003
Yeah, I think so.

454
00:39:14,567 --> 00:39:17,764
- What are you doing here, I thought...
- Let's move, mister.

455
00:39:43,007 --> 00:39:45,760
Sir.
Son.

456
00:39:59,127 --> 00:40:02,244
I gave the order. It's my responsibility.

457
00:40:05,687 --> 00:40:07,564
I pulled the trigger.

458
00:40:10,887 --> 00:40:12,286
That's mine.

459
00:40:21,687 --> 00:40:23,643
Madam President?

460
00:40:26,087 --> 00:40:27,998
Madam President?

461
00:40:31,287 --> 00:40:33,755
I'm sorry, you were saying something?

462
00:40:37,927 --> 00:40:40,122
Twenty-four hours, no Cylons.

463
00:40:40,807 --> 00:40:44,720
- At least you know it was the right choice.
- The right choice.

464
00:40:50,807 --> 00:40:53,924
I'm sorry, Billy.
I think I'd like some time alone, please.

465
00:40:54,007 --> 00:40:55,645
Of course.

466
00:41:07,607 --> 00:41:08,960
What is it?

467
00:41:10,487 --> 00:41:14,036
- Update on the headcount?
- Subtract how many?

468
00:41:14,767 --> 00:41:16,803
Actually, you can add one.

469
00:41:19,167 --> 00:41:22,398
<i>A baby was born this morning
on the Rising Star.</i>

470
00:41:23,567 --> 00:41:24,841
A boy.

471
00:41:25,687 --> 00:41:28,121
- A baby.
- Yeah.

472
00:41:35,247 --> 00:41:36,566
Thank you.
