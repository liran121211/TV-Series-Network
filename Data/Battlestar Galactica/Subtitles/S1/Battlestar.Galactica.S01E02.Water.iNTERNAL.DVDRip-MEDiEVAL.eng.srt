1
00:00:02,047 --> 00:00:04,515
<i>Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.</i>

2
00:00:35,687 --> 00:00:37,564
Radiological alarm!
From where?

3
00:00:37,647 --> 00:00:40,036
<i>The Olympic Carrier, sir.
They've got nukes on board.</i>

4
00:00:40,127 --> 00:00:42,960
If the ship poses a threat to us,
we have to eliminate that threat.

5
00:00:43,047 --> 00:00:46,483
The Cylons will be here any second.
If we're gonna do this, then just do it.

6
00:00:46,567 --> 00:00:48,956
- It's a civilian ship.
- Do it.

7
00:00:51,767 --> 00:00:53,723
- Giving up my seat.
- Like hell.

8
00:00:58,167 --> 00:01:02,160
Sharon? What are you doing here?
Let's move, mister.

9
00:03:08,847 --> 00:03:11,645
- Excuse me, Lieutenant.
- Specialist. Good evening.

10
00:03:11,727 --> 00:03:13,957
- Sir?
- Is something wrong?

11
00:03:14,447 --> 00:03:16,756
No, sir. It's just morning, sir.

12
00:03:17,527 --> 00:03:19,757
- What time is it?
- 0545.

13
00:04:04,607 --> 00:04:05,960
Oh, my God.

14
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,085
Oh, my God.

15
00:04:12,407 --> 00:04:14,477
Where are the rest of them?

16
00:05:29,007 --> 00:05:31,441
<i>Attention. Colonial One will arrive
in 30 minutes.</i>

17
00:05:31,527 --> 00:05:34,519
<i>Honour detail report in quarters.
Where the hell is it?</i>

18
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:39,602
Damned son of a... sash.
I heard you the first time!

19
00:06:01,927 --> 00:06:02,996
One.

20
00:06:05,047 --> 00:06:06,116
Two.

21
00:06:07,887 --> 00:06:09,002
Three.

22
00:06:11,487 --> 00:06:12,602
Four.

23
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:17,043
Five.

24
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:26,326
<i>Do it.</i>

25
00:06:45,407 --> 00:06:48,956
<i>I can't stop thinking
about the Olympic Carrier.</i>

26
00:06:49,247 --> 00:06:51,203
That was three days ago.

27
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:54,241
It's ancient history
under these circumstances.

28
00:06:54,327 --> 00:06:57,205
<i>Leave the second-guessing to the historians.</i>

29
00:06:59,847 --> 00:07:02,361
But don't we have a responsibility?

30
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:08,126
I mean, as leaders, don't we have
an obligation to question our actions to...

31
00:07:09,207 --> 00:07:13,041
I don't know. To make sure the decisions
we make are the right decisions.

32
00:07:13,127 --> 00:07:15,357
We did what we had to do, Son.

33
00:07:15,767 --> 00:07:19,442
A man takes responsibility for his actions,
right or wrong.

34
00:07:20,687 --> 00:07:23,884
He accepts the consequences
and lives with them...

35
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:25,806
every day.

36
00:07:29,687 --> 00:07:32,485
<i>Colonial One, Galactica.
Proceed to Omega Docking.</i>

37
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:35,127
<i>Contact CIC when you have hard seal.</i>

38
00:07:35,727 --> 00:07:37,638
<i>Roger that, Galactica.</i>

39
00:07:42,407 --> 00:07:44,637
Excuse me, Madam President.
We've arrived...

40
00:07:44,727 --> 00:07:47,321
Please don't tell me
that we have to go through this...

41
00:07:47,407 --> 00:07:49,284
every time I step on that ship.

42
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:53,201
No, ma'am. But they will always
render honours for your arrival. It's protocol.

43
00:07:53,287 --> 00:07:55,084
The military, they do love their protocol.

44
00:07:55,167 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm sure if they knew you didn't like it,
they'd be willing to...

45
00:07:58,087 --> 00:08:00,442
No. Let Adama sound the trumpets.

46
00:08:00,527 --> 00:08:04,042
It makes him feel more comfortable.
Maybe if he feels more comfortable...

47
00:08:04,127 --> 00:08:07,437
- he'll be a little easier to deal with.
- That's smart.

48
00:08:07,527 --> 00:08:10,246
No, it's not smart. It's politics.

49
00:08:10,807 --> 00:08:13,480
I think I'm going to get tired
of this outfit.

50
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:16,445
Seeing as I only have three
for the rest of my life.

51
00:08:16,527 --> 00:08:19,599
- That looks fine.
- Fine?

52
00:08:21,127 --> 00:08:22,685
It looks great.

53
00:08:24,327 --> 00:08:27,205
You don't know anything
about women, do you?

54
00:08:28,647 --> 00:08:31,320
- Shall we?
- Let's go be "presidential. "

55
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:35,721
I am confident that I speak for the entire fleet
when I say thank you.

56
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:40,676
Without your extraordinary dedication,
your tireless effort, your sacrifice...

57
00:08:41,127 --> 00:08:43,561
no one of us would be here today.

58
00:08:44,047 --> 00:08:47,198
I'm proud to serve as your President.
Thank you.

59
00:08:53,007 --> 00:08:54,235
Carry on.

60
00:08:54,327 --> 00:08:57,524
<i>Sir, the Virgon Express
is manoeuvring alongside.</i>

61
00:08:57,607 --> 00:09:01,202
- They're standing by for unrep.
- Thank you very much, D.

62
00:09:01,367 --> 00:09:04,245
Officer of the Watch,
you'll proceed with the unrep, please.

63
00:09:04,327 --> 00:09:05,601
Aye, sir.

64
00:09:05,767 --> 00:09:07,723
If you'll step this way.
Thank you.

65
00:09:07,807 --> 00:09:11,595
- Excuse me, Chief. A word with you, please.
- Just one second.

66
00:09:13,047 --> 00:09:15,720
You know what? Just let's do it. What's up?

67
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:17,520
Got a problem.

68
00:09:17,607 --> 00:09:19,962
Yes, sir, Lieutenant, sir.

69
00:09:20,047 --> 00:09:23,039
I believe the navcon modules
are ready for inspection.

70
00:09:24,487 --> 00:09:27,604
<i>Virgon Express, Galactica.
We have you in visual contact.</i>

71
00:09:27,687 --> 00:09:29,564
<i>Maintain current course and speed.</i>

72
00:09:29,647 --> 00:09:33,242
<i>Roger that, Galactica.
Maintain current course and speed.</i>

73
00:09:34,087 --> 00:09:38,160
Powering up stabilisation gyros
24A through 48C.

74
00:09:38,247 --> 00:09:41,762
<i>Galactica's water recycling system
is close to 100% effective.</i>

75
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:45,442
<i>For all intents and purposes, there's not
a drop of water that's wasted aboard.</i>

76
00:09:45,527 --> 00:09:48,360
We have enough water
for several years before replenishing.

77
00:09:48,447 --> 00:09:51,439
<i>- I see.
- Many of the ships like the Virgon Express...</i>

78
00:09:51,527 --> 00:09:54,041
were not made for long-term voyages...

79
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:57,642
- and will have to tank off of us periodically.
- Right.

80
00:10:00,007 --> 00:10:04,478
Whatever it is, we're gonna take care of it,
okay? You all right?

81
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,599
Now, tell me what happened.
What's going on?

82
00:10:07,767 --> 00:10:10,156
There are at this moment
six G-4 detonators...

83
00:10:10,247 --> 00:10:13,284
missing from the small-arms locker
on Deck 15.

84
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:17,445
Commander, ready to extend the water boom.

85
00:10:18,447 --> 00:10:19,800
Excuse me.

86
00:10:25,767 --> 00:10:28,759
How's it going?
Oh, boy, I feel like a...

87
00:10:29,807 --> 00:10:32,446
- Tour guide?
- It shows?

88
00:10:32,527 --> 00:10:34,483
Well, she was a teacher.

89
00:10:34,887 --> 00:10:38,562
Probably sees all this
as one big educational experience.

90
00:10:38,887 --> 00:10:43,677
- He thinks I'm a total idiot, doesn't he?
- What? No, sir. No.

91
00:10:45,247 --> 00:10:46,282
It's all right.

92
00:10:46,367 --> 00:10:47,686
What are you telling me for?

93
00:10:47,767 --> 00:10:51,043
If munitions go missing,
you got to tell the master-at-arms now!

94
00:10:51,127 --> 00:10:52,162
I know that!

95
00:10:52,247 --> 00:10:54,363
You can't screw around with stuff like this!

96
00:10:54,447 --> 00:10:57,723
I'm not screwing around, okay?
The only reason I didn't tell anybody...

97
00:10:57,807 --> 00:11:00,719
is 'cause they're gonna think
I'm the one who took them.

98
00:11:05,767 --> 00:11:07,280
How are things?

99
00:11:07,807 --> 00:11:09,718
Things are good.
Good.

100
00:11:11,887 --> 00:11:13,366
You look good.

101
00:11:15,687 --> 00:11:17,643
I really like your hair.

102
00:11:19,607 --> 00:11:20,835
My hair?

103
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,644
I don't know anything about women.

104
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,843
Madam President, if I may?

105
00:11:29,287 --> 00:11:32,120
I think you should know that my father...

106
00:11:32,607 --> 00:11:36,361
- Well, this entire ceremony was his idea.
- I know.

107
00:11:37,607 --> 00:11:39,598
I think he's enjoying it.

108
00:11:40,247 --> 00:11:43,444
Actually, he hates protocol, pomp,
and all that.

109
00:11:46,447 --> 00:11:49,041
- Really?
- He's making a gesture.

110
00:11:49,567 --> 00:11:52,445
Trying to make you feel like the President.

111
00:11:57,727 --> 00:11:59,797
Open Valves 3 and 5.

112
00:12:05,287 --> 00:12:09,200
I took the one detonator
from the duffel, replaced it...

113
00:12:09,767 --> 00:12:12,235
and then I went back to my quarters.

114
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:20,996
Well...

115
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:27,478
You know what? It's not your fault.

116
00:12:27,567 --> 00:12:30,639
Someone's obviously setting you up
to take the fall for something.

117
00:12:30,727 --> 00:12:31,762
That's what it is.

118
00:12:31,847 --> 00:12:34,236
You wake up somewhere,
you don't know how you got there.

119
00:12:34,327 --> 00:12:38,320
You're drugged, or manipulated,
or who knows what. Something.

120
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,006
What do we do?

121
00:12:43,887 --> 00:12:47,277
Because if I report what's happened,
they'll think I'm a Cylon agent.

122
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:51,121
No, they're not. No.
Why would they think that? That's crazy.

123
00:12:51,207 --> 00:12:54,836
People are getting crazy, okay?
You've heard the rumours.

124
00:12:54,927 --> 00:12:57,999
Cylons who look like humans,
sleeper agents hiding in the fleet.

125
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:02,964
Decompression alarm!

126
00:13:10,327 --> 00:13:12,158
Damage report, Mr. Gaeta.

127
00:13:12,247 --> 00:13:14,920
Ruptures in Tanks 3, 5, 7, 9.

128
00:13:15,007 --> 00:13:17,123
Strain on the unrep lines.
They're gonna blow.

129
00:13:17,207 --> 00:13:20,324
Release the lines. Veer away, starboard!

130
00:13:26,127 --> 00:13:28,721
Every tank on the port side has ruptured.

131
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:31,116
We're venting all our water
directly into space.

132
00:13:45,527 --> 00:13:48,599
CIC, it's DC One. We're entering the tank.

133
00:13:48,687 --> 00:13:50,405
<i>Roger that, DC One.</i>

134
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:15,764
Raptor 478, DC One. I have you in my sights.

135
00:14:19,247 --> 00:14:21,807
Copy that, DC One, I have you in sight.

136
00:14:21,887 --> 00:14:23,002
<i>Understood.</i>

137
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:26,439
How's it look in there?
Can you tell what happened?

138
00:14:26,527 --> 00:14:28,563
Lieutenant, don't worry...

139
00:14:30,087 --> 00:14:33,045
about my team. I've got things under control.

140
00:14:33,407 --> 00:14:36,843
Copy that, DC One.
I feel better knowing you're on it.

141
00:14:40,567 --> 00:14:42,319
Watch the light, you're off target.

142
00:14:43,487 --> 00:14:45,603
How much water did we lose?

143
00:14:45,847 --> 00:14:50,079
Ten million JPs, sir.
Almost 60% of total potable water reserves.

144
00:14:51,167 --> 00:14:52,600
Emergency rations.

145
00:14:52,687 --> 00:14:56,077
<i>Shut down laundry, showers,
anything nonessential immediately.</i>

146
00:14:56,167 --> 00:14:57,282
Yes, sir.

147
00:14:57,367 --> 00:15:01,838
<i>- How long will our water supplies last?
- Aboard Galactica, about six days.</i>

148
00:15:02,327 --> 00:15:06,923
But one-third of the other ships in the fleet
were depending on us for replenishment.

149
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:10,602
If we don't find new supplies
they'll run out of water in two days.

150
00:15:10,687 --> 00:15:12,643
One-third? That's 16,000 people.

151
00:15:13,127 --> 00:15:14,321
Get the names of those ships.

152
00:15:14,407 --> 00:15:17,160
Tell their captains to go
on emergency rations immediately.

153
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,238
There's gonna be riots in those ships.

154
00:15:19,327 --> 00:15:23,206
Civilians don't like hearing they can't
take a bath, wash their clothes...

155
00:15:23,287 --> 00:15:26,723
- or drink more than a thimble a day.
- Thank you for the warning, Colonel.

156
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:31,042
- That'll be all, Mr. Gaeta.
- One more thing. Lieutenant?

157
00:15:31,687 --> 00:15:35,043
Do you have any theories
about what may have caused the accident?

158
00:15:39,127 --> 00:15:42,642
There are many theories at this point,
Madam President.

159
00:15:44,207 --> 00:15:45,959
Do you have a guess?

160
00:15:47,007 --> 00:15:50,363
I tell my officers not to guess.
I prefer to wait until we have fact.

161
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,926
Um-hm. Indulge me.

162
00:15:57,407 --> 00:15:59,363
Take a guess, Mr. Gaeta.

163
00:16:01,007 --> 00:16:03,999
I'd have to say
the most likely explanation is...

164
00:16:04,087 --> 00:16:08,160
that the tank was structurally weakened
during the Cylon nuclear detonation...

165
00:16:08,247 --> 00:16:12,035
during the first attack,
and that caused it to buckle and rupture.

166
00:16:12,127 --> 00:16:15,676
But it's too early to say. Sir.
Interesting.

167
00:16:16,487 --> 00:16:18,796
- Thank you, Lieutenant.
- Back to the matter at hand.

168
00:16:18,887 --> 00:16:21,799
I've ordered an astronomical survey
of nearby stars systems...

169
00:16:21,887 --> 00:16:24,845
- for potential water sources. Colonel?
- Yes, sir.

170
00:16:30,887 --> 00:16:32,957
Chief, take a look at this.

171
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:39,715
What do you got?
Not sure.

172
00:16:40,807 --> 00:16:43,719
It looks like burn marks
from an explosive.

173
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:46,719
What do you think?

174
00:16:48,727 --> 00:16:49,716
Umm...

175
00:16:52,127 --> 00:16:55,039
It's tough to tell.
It's pretty rusted out.

176
00:17:00,607 --> 00:17:03,758
Optical and x-ray telescopes say
there are five systems...

177
00:17:03,847 --> 00:17:05,997
within our practical jump radius.

178
00:17:06,087 --> 00:17:10,239
All five have planetary bodies
with the potential for finding water...

179
00:17:10,327 --> 00:17:12,795
in either a liquid or a frozen state.

180
00:17:12,887 --> 00:17:16,323
Put together a plan for Raptors
to scout each star system.

181
00:17:16,407 --> 00:17:19,285
- I want the first launch at 17:30.
- Yes, sir.

182
00:17:20,047 --> 00:17:23,881
Colonel, how likely are we
to find water on any of these planets?

183
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,481
Now you want me to guess, I take it.

184
00:17:27,207 --> 00:17:30,244
- Colonel.
- Sir.

185
00:17:31,807 --> 00:17:36,005
My apologies, Madam President.
Difficult day for everyone.

186
00:17:36,527 --> 00:17:37,846
I understand.

187
00:17:37,927 --> 00:17:41,203
Most planets are just hunks of rock
or balls of gas.

188
00:17:41,287 --> 00:17:45,200
The galaxy's a pretty barren, desolate place
when you get right down to it.

189
00:17:45,287 --> 00:17:46,356
Thank you, Colonel.

190
00:17:46,447 --> 00:17:49,041
The water rationing'll
make our supply problem worse.

191
00:17:49,127 --> 00:17:52,403
Dr. Baltar, please share the results
of your study.

192
00:17:56,407 --> 00:18:00,320
I've calculated the rate of consumption
regarding basic foodstuffs...

193
00:18:00,407 --> 00:18:01,886
for the civilian population.

194
00:18:01,967 --> 00:18:04,879
This is based on information
available to me at the time.

195
00:18:04,967 --> 00:18:09,165
The current civilian population of 45,265...

196
00:18:09,287 --> 00:18:11,357
will require, at minimum...

197
00:18:11,447 --> 00:18:14,439
82 tons of grain, 85 tons of meat...

198
00:18:15,207 --> 00:18:19,120
119 tons of fruit, 304 tons of vegetables...

199
00:18:20,407 --> 00:18:24,002
- and 2.5 million JPs of water.
- Is that per month?

200
00:18:25,847 --> 00:18:27,121
Per week.

201
00:18:37,207 --> 00:18:38,765
They found your Raptor.

202
00:18:40,527 --> 00:18:41,676
A few or a lot?

203
00:18:44,927 --> 00:18:47,805
That's what you get
for coming back for me.

204
00:18:48,767 --> 00:18:50,485
Frack.
Yeah.

205
00:18:53,647 --> 00:18:56,480
I was sure they didn't track me coming in.

206
00:18:57,647 --> 00:18:59,717
- I know.
- I set the jiggers to pulse.

207
00:18:59,807 --> 00:19:01,001
I'm sure you did.

208
00:19:01,087 --> 00:19:05,239
I didn't set off any detection grids,
any dradis sweeps, or pingers.

209
00:19:06,447 --> 00:19:09,803
- Never send a pilot to do an ECO's job.
- I can do your job.

210
00:19:09,887 --> 00:19:13,516
I guess that's why the toasters are crawling
all over our ride out of here.

211
00:19:13,607 --> 00:19:15,199
I don't suppose there's a Plan B.

212
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:17,323
Plans B, C, D and E are the same as Plan A.

213
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:19,796
Get off the planet and get back to the ship.
Come on.

214
00:19:19,887 --> 00:19:20,922
Where are we going?

215
00:19:21,007 --> 00:19:23,123
Don't ask questions.
Just follow your pilot.

216
00:19:23,207 --> 00:19:24,242
Yes, sir.

217
00:19:28,327 --> 00:19:29,316
Umm...

218
00:19:29,447 --> 00:19:33,235
So far we've found five discrete
detonation points in the tank...

219
00:19:33,327 --> 00:19:36,319
and we believe that there may be a sixth.

220
00:19:36,647 --> 00:19:40,845
I've suspected due to the size
of the residual scoring...

221
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,679
and the burn points...

222
00:19:42,767 --> 00:19:45,839
that we are dealing with a G-4 type explosive.

223
00:19:46,407 --> 00:19:49,604
So I've requested a spot check
of all inventory...

224
00:19:49,687 --> 00:19:53,362
from the master-at-arms
and she indicated to me...

225
00:19:53,447 --> 00:19:57,076
that there are six detonators missing
from a small-arms locker...

226
00:19:57,167 --> 00:19:59,078
in the port flight pod.

227
00:19:59,767 --> 00:20:02,804
<i>So one detonator may still be
unaccounted for.</i>

228
00:20:03,167 --> 00:20:07,718
Have the master-at-arms post guards
at all small-arms lockers immediately.

229
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:11,876
It's already done, sir.
She also has opened an investigation...

230
00:20:11,967 --> 00:20:14,879
into who may have had access to that locker.

231
00:20:15,207 --> 00:20:19,166
However, due to spotty record-keeping...

232
00:20:19,247 --> 00:20:22,364
and lax internal security procedures
since the attack...

233
00:20:22,447 --> 00:20:26,599
she believes that we may never know
who took the detonators.

234
00:20:31,007 --> 00:20:33,077
Chief, thank you very much.

235
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:37,524
Everyone except for Col. Tigh,
Capt. Adama, and Dr. Baltar...

236
00:20:37,927 --> 00:20:39,440
are now released.

237
00:20:39,527 --> 00:20:43,486
Please remember:
this briefing is strictly confidential.

238
00:20:55,647 --> 00:20:58,798
<i>There is at least one Cylon
aboard the Galactica.</i>

239
00:21:09,287 --> 00:21:11,721
How many people know
the Cylons look human?

240
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:15,356
The rumour mill's been working overtime.
Half the ship's talking about it.

241
00:21:15,447 --> 00:21:18,883
There'll always be rumours.
For most people, that's all they'll ever be.

242
00:21:19,007 --> 00:21:21,805
I'm asking how many people actually know?

243
00:21:22,527 --> 00:21:24,882
The five people in this room,
plus three Marines.

244
00:21:24,967 --> 00:21:27,765
Let's keep it that way.
Once this gets out officially...

245
00:21:27,847 --> 00:21:31,476
people will be accusing each other
of being Cylons for no reason at all.

246
00:21:31,567 --> 00:21:35,242
I agree. Dr. Baltar,
how're we doing on the screenings?

247
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:36,362
The screenings?

248
00:21:36,447 --> 00:21:41,043
<i>You were supposed to be screening
Galactica crew for potential Cylon agents.</i>

249
00:21:43,047 --> 00:21:46,198
Do you remember
the first time you lied to a woman?

250
00:21:46,287 --> 00:21:48,596
<i>Other than your mother, that is.</i>

251
00:21:48,687 --> 00:21:49,915
Other than my mother.

252
00:21:53,407 --> 00:21:56,558
Sherry Bennett. Fourth grade.

253
00:21:56,887 --> 00:21:59,447
On the playground, behind the band room.

254
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:01,757
"If you show me yours, I'll show you mine. "

255
00:22:01,847 --> 00:22:04,805
She did. I did not.

256
00:22:06,007 --> 00:22:09,443
You know, I think I slept with her actually,
many years later, of course.

257
00:22:09,527 --> 00:22:10,516
Of course.

258
00:22:12,127 --> 00:22:14,118
Did she turn out to be
a beautiful woman?

259
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:16,243
As a matter of fact, she did.

260
00:22:16,327 --> 00:22:17,885
Very beautiful.

261
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:23,041
But every woman has her beauty...

262
00:22:25,447 --> 00:22:28,007
her feminine charms that are hers
and hers alone.

263
00:22:28,087 --> 00:22:30,481
<i>Doctor?</i>

264
00:22:32,527 --> 00:22:34,085
The screenings.

265
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:38,518
To tell you the truth,
there are significant problems...

266
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:41,121
with implementing
my Cylon detection method...

267
00:22:41,207 --> 00:22:43,277
<i>that I used aboard Galactica previously...</i>

268
00:22:43,367 --> 00:22:46,086
and basically because
I've run out of natural resources.

269
00:22:46,167 --> 00:22:49,842
I need chemical compounds.
For example, the precursor test.

270
00:22:49,927 --> 00:22:53,078
I need large samples of tetrahydrocycline...

271
00:22:53,167 --> 00:22:55,761
which I don't have to tell you...
Maybe I do have to.

272
00:22:55,847 --> 00:22:59,157
It's a highly volatile chemical...
Let me stop you there.

273
00:22:59,247 --> 00:23:03,445
Your intellect obviously outstrips
everyone in this room.

274
00:23:04,887 --> 00:23:08,357
But it's also obvious
by the way that you're talking...

275
00:23:08,647 --> 00:23:11,684
that in order to make
large-scale screenings...

276
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:15,203
you're going to need help, staff, resources.

277
00:23:17,967 --> 00:23:22,085
Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. Exactly.

278
00:23:23,367 --> 00:23:25,483
Although, more staff?

279
00:23:25,567 --> 00:23:28,764
Someone snooping around,
watching your every move?

280
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:32,723
Maybe it'll be a woman,
you could find her secret beauty.

281
00:23:32,807 --> 00:23:35,685
I'm going to assign Lt. Gaeta
to aid you...

282
00:23:36,447 --> 00:23:38,324
in anything that you might need.

283
00:23:38,407 --> 00:23:40,045
So much for that.

284
00:23:41,727 --> 00:23:43,399
But the need for secrecy?

285
00:23:43,487 --> 00:23:47,116
Clearly, this falls
into the "absolutely necessary" category.

286
00:23:47,207 --> 00:23:50,802
Your screening techniques
may be critical to our very survival.

287
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:53,845
Humanity's very survival rests in your hands.

288
00:23:55,327 --> 00:23:58,319
Now, if only you had
an actual Cylon detector.

289
00:24:01,967 --> 00:24:03,559
This is a critical mission.

290
00:24:03,647 --> 00:24:06,764
Fights have already broken out
on some ships over the rations.

291
00:24:06,847 --> 00:24:10,157
There's panic in the air. You don't find water
out there and find it soon...

292
00:24:10,247 --> 00:24:13,796
- I understand, Captain. We'll find it.
- Good hunting.

293
00:24:17,727 --> 00:24:19,524
Hey, Chief.
Captain.

294
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:22,845
- Lieutenant.
- Chief.

295
00:24:24,247 --> 00:24:26,363
I feel like my head's about to explode.

296
00:24:26,447 --> 00:24:28,915
Just relax, calm down.
Focus on the mission.

297
00:24:29,007 --> 00:24:32,124
We'll take care of everything
when you get back.

298
00:24:32,247 --> 00:24:34,044
What about the investigation?

299
00:24:34,127 --> 00:24:37,756
Master-at-arms is running it.
Don't worry, there's no connection to you.

300
00:24:37,847 --> 00:24:41,396
In fact, there's no reason to believe
you had anything to do with it at all.

301
00:24:41,487 --> 00:24:43,159
I didn't.
I know.

302
00:24:43,407 --> 00:24:48,037
- I would never do something like that. Never.
- Sharon, I know.

303
00:24:49,887 --> 00:24:52,879
It's really important you believe me on this.

304
00:24:53,087 --> 00:24:55,726
- You do believe me, right?
- Absolutely.

305
00:24:57,367 --> 00:25:01,042
Yes, sir.
Thank you, Chief. Carry on.

306
00:25:05,007 --> 00:25:07,805
Please excuse me for keeping you waiting.

307
00:25:08,047 --> 00:25:11,437
I was called into the engine room.
It'll just take a moment.

308
00:25:11,527 --> 00:25:13,165
That's all right.

309
00:25:14,207 --> 00:25:16,641
Sometime I'd like to borrow a book or two.

310
00:25:16,727 --> 00:25:20,163
<i>I only brought one with me
on the flight to Galactica.</i>

311
00:25:21,607 --> 00:25:25,361
<i>What book?
A Murder on Picon.</i>

312
00:25:27,407 --> 00:25:30,797
<i>I have a weakness for mystery.
Ever read Dark Day?</i>

313
00:25:30,887 --> 00:25:33,526
Edward Prima. I am embarrassed to say...

314
00:25:33,607 --> 00:25:37,520
it's one of those classics
I've never gotten around to reading.

315
00:25:44,367 --> 00:25:45,925
I think you'll enjoy it.

316
00:25:49,127 --> 00:25:50,446
Thank you.

317
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,356
It may be a while
before I get this back to you.

318
00:25:54,447 --> 00:25:57,120
It's a gift. Never lend books.

319
00:25:58,527 --> 00:26:00,563
Well, then thank you for the gift.

320
00:26:00,647 --> 00:26:03,286
I'm really looking forward
to working with you, Doctor.

321
00:26:03,367 --> 00:26:05,403
- You have a friend.
- As am I, Lieutenant.

322
00:26:05,487 --> 00:26:07,398
I actually studied genetics in college.

323
00:26:07,487 --> 00:26:09,637
I was planning on going
for my graduate degree...

324
00:26:09,727 --> 00:26:11,445
through the military extension program.

325
00:26:11,527 --> 00:26:13,802
Wonderful. Is that a card game?

326
00:26:15,167 --> 00:26:18,921
And the girl wins again. Another round?

327
00:26:19,447 --> 00:26:21,597
Come on, guys. Grace under pressure.

328
00:26:21,687 --> 00:26:25,521
<i>Nothing like losing a little money
to take your mind off those 14-hour patrols.</i>

329
00:26:25,607 --> 00:26:29,566
- Mind if I sit in, Lieutenant?
- If you got the cubits, we've got the chair.

330
00:26:29,647 --> 00:26:34,084
Of course if you've got anything to drink,
we'll take that in lieu of cash.

331
00:26:34,167 --> 00:26:36,635
You know I don't have any money, but...

332
00:26:37,247 --> 00:26:39,841
this jacket must be worth at least 15 cubits.

333
00:26:39,927 --> 00:26:43,397
It's made of the finest Caprican cloth,
warm in winter, cooling in summer.

334
00:26:43,487 --> 00:26:44,602
It'd look great on you.

335
00:26:44,687 --> 00:26:49,124
Anybody else got any civilian clothes
they'd be interested in putting on the table?

336
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,444
Don't let me keep you.

337
00:26:57,927 --> 00:26:59,326
Col. Tigh was right.

338
00:26:59,407 --> 00:27:02,763
Rioting broke out on a cruise ship
when they reduced water rations.

339
00:27:02,847 --> 00:27:06,681
We need to demonstrate an ability
to maintain order. We need to do it now.

340
00:27:06,767 --> 00:27:10,123
We don't have extra manpower
for fleet security.

341
00:27:10,247 --> 00:27:13,842
You have the only armed,
disciplined force available.

342
00:27:13,927 --> 00:27:16,885
Yeah, but I'm not going to be
your policeman.

343
00:27:17,327 --> 00:27:20,399
There's a reason why you separate
military and the police.

344
00:27:20,487 --> 00:27:25,083
One fights the enemy of the state.
The other serves and protects the people.

345
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:28,446
When the military becomes both...

346
00:27:29,927 --> 00:27:33,283
then the enemies of the state
tend to become the people.

347
00:27:33,367 --> 00:27:37,599
I appreciate the complexity of the issue
and I won't let that happen.

348
00:27:41,847 --> 00:27:46,363
- I'll send troops to the cruise ship.
- Commander, I won't let that happen.

349
00:27:56,847 --> 00:28:00,476
- Beginning dradis one sweep.
- Beginning dradis two sweep.

350
00:28:01,087 --> 00:28:04,523
So I'm thinking we should give
this lovely little rock of nothing a name.

351
00:28:04,607 --> 00:28:08,282
- I'm thinking "Kimiko. "
- "Kimiko"?

352
00:28:08,367 --> 00:28:12,155
After a lovely little lady, in a lovely little city,
in a lovely little colony...

353
00:28:12,247 --> 00:28:14,522
- that I used to know.
- Whatever.

354
00:28:30,087 --> 00:28:33,284
Sorry. So sorry.
You had such a good run, though.

355
00:28:34,607 --> 00:28:36,484
Looks like the bet's to me.

356
00:28:36,567 --> 00:28:39,559
I'll try and muddle through
for another round.

357
00:28:39,647 --> 00:28:42,719
<i>I'm going to raise you five.</i>

358
00:28:44,007 --> 00:28:47,238
No guts, no glory, Doctor. I'll see your five...

359
00:28:50,007 --> 00:28:51,645
and raise you 20.

360
00:28:54,247 --> 00:28:56,078
Now it's just you and me.

361
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:59,364
I'm not used to playing
in this kind of high-stakes game.

362
00:28:59,447 --> 00:29:01,597
It's not too late to bow out.

363
00:29:01,687 --> 00:29:05,805
Now there's an excellent suggestion.
And before proceeding any further...

364
00:29:05,887 --> 00:29:09,243
I should really examine my motivations
for doing so.

365
00:29:09,887 --> 00:29:13,084
Staying in the game,
I run the risk of losing my entire stake...

366
00:29:13,167 --> 00:29:15,761
and being humiliated
in front of these lovely people.

367
00:29:15,847 --> 00:29:18,441
"Humiliated" is a such a strong word.

368
00:29:19,127 --> 00:29:21,516
"Embarrassed" would be my choice.

369
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:23,280
You do play rough, don't you?

370
00:29:23,367 --> 00:29:24,959
A little too rough for you.

371
00:29:25,047 --> 00:29:28,722
My hand's not that strong. It wouldn't
take much to knock me out of the game.

372
00:29:28,807 --> 00:29:30,798
Well, thank you, Doctor.

373
00:29:34,407 --> 00:29:37,797
However, without a little risk...

374
00:29:38,567 --> 00:29:42,526
life would be so dull, wouldn't it? Calling.

375
00:29:52,887 --> 00:29:54,400
Three on a run.

376
00:29:58,207 --> 00:29:59,640
Full colours.

377
00:30:03,807 --> 00:30:08,437
Thank you all for a most pleasant evening.

378
00:30:22,367 --> 00:30:23,880
A parting gift.

379
00:30:25,207 --> 00:30:29,041
Hand-rolled from some
of the finest fumarello leaf in Caprica.

380
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:34,523
And it's also one of the last left
in the universe.

381
00:30:37,567 --> 00:30:38,920
Thank you.

382
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:44,366
My pleasure.

383
00:30:52,247 --> 00:30:53,566
Excuse me.

384
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:04,966
The Raptors have reported back
after three star systems.

385
00:31:05,047 --> 00:31:08,756
- So far, all report negative for water, sir.
- I just checked with Astrometrics.

386
00:31:08,847 --> 00:31:11,042
They're coming up with big goose eggs.

387
00:31:11,127 --> 00:31:14,244
There's no star systems
within the range of our telescopes...

388
00:31:14,327 --> 00:31:16,841
with planetary bodies
likely to have water on them.

389
00:31:16,927 --> 00:31:21,557
Sir. Another Raptor just checked in.
Negative on water as well.

390
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:24,959
Who's left?
Boomer and Crashdown, sir.

391
00:31:25,047 --> 00:31:27,515
If they come up negative as well...

392
00:31:28,287 --> 00:31:30,243
what's our back-up plan?

393
00:31:30,767 --> 00:31:34,760
We'll jump to another sector
and start the search all over again.

394
00:31:37,487 --> 00:31:41,878
- Needle in a haystack.
- More like grain of salt on a beach.

395
00:31:49,767 --> 00:31:51,997
Still nothing and...

396
00:31:55,047 --> 00:31:56,526
more nothing.

397
00:31:58,527 --> 00:32:00,245
I got nothing here, either.

398
00:32:04,527 --> 00:32:06,040
Then that's it.

399
00:32:06,687 --> 00:32:10,839
Five moons, five zeroes.
I'm getting thirsty just thinking about it.

400
00:32:17,447 --> 00:32:20,280
Hope somebody else
has more luck out there.

401
00:32:21,327 --> 00:32:23,124
Yeah.

402
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:25,277
What's on your mind,
Boomer?

403
00:32:25,407 --> 00:32:28,797
I don't know. I have this feeling.

404
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:35,480
- Let's run that last sweep again.
- You're the boss.

405
00:32:36,727 --> 00:32:40,720
- Beginning sweep 21.
- Beginning sweep 22.

406
00:32:45,367 --> 00:32:48,518
Boomer,
I'm getting nothing again. How about you?

407
00:32:55,327 --> 00:32:59,161
I'm having trouble saying it.
What do you mean?

408
00:33:14,927 --> 00:33:16,565
I think I see...

409
00:33:21,367 --> 00:33:22,356
Oh!

410
00:33:22,927 --> 00:33:25,202
I have positive contact! Yeah!

411
00:33:27,767 --> 00:33:30,884
Oh, yes! Yeah!

412
00:33:32,647 --> 00:33:34,365
Good call, Boomer.

413
00:33:39,727 --> 00:33:42,161
Sir. Dradis just picked up Boomer's Raptor.

414
00:33:42,247 --> 00:33:43,521
Let's hear it.

415
00:33:44,207 --> 00:33:45,640
<i>Galactica, Crashdown.</i>

416
00:33:45,727 --> 00:33:48,480
<i>Dradis sweeps indicate it's time
to break out the swimsuits...</i>

417
00:33:48,567 --> 00:33:52,003
<i>because we've found water!
Repeat: Positive water contact!</i>

418
00:33:59,127 --> 00:34:01,561
Patch me in to the entire fleet.

419
00:34:06,447 --> 00:34:08,278
You're connected, sir.

420
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,117
Attention. This is the commander.

421
00:34:11,647 --> 00:34:13,399
<i>We have found water!</i>

422
00:34:20,047 --> 00:34:21,878
Let's go have a drink.

423
00:34:22,327 --> 00:34:26,559
I think they're pleased. I can hear them
screaming in the background.

424
00:34:53,487 --> 00:34:55,603
Sharon, be careful with that needle.

425
00:34:55,687 --> 00:34:58,645
<i>We're running low
on anti-radiation medicine.</i>

426
00:35:04,367 --> 00:35:08,599
- Not really Mom's home cooking.
- Yeah? It beats eating grass and leaves.

427
00:35:08,687 --> 00:35:12,521
We'll be cooking up a fine meal
of twigs and moss by the end of the week.

428
00:35:12,607 --> 00:35:14,040
You spoil me.

429
00:35:18,287 --> 00:35:22,326
Can I ask you something, Sharon?
Why'd you come back for me?

430
00:35:24,447 --> 00:35:26,244
I hate to fly alone.

431
00:35:28,887 --> 00:35:33,403
Come on. You disobeyed orders,
flew back into this hellhole...

432
00:35:34,167 --> 00:35:37,125
and not that I don't appreciate it, but why?

433
00:35:39,727 --> 00:35:43,356
I just couldn't leave you behind.
Let's leave it at that.

434
00:35:54,927 --> 00:35:56,645
It's a Colonial Fleet signal.

435
00:35:58,247 --> 00:36:00,761
I can't decode it,
but it means there's someone.

436
00:36:00,847 --> 00:36:04,556
Someone in the military
is still alive and kicking here in Caprica.

437
00:36:04,647 --> 00:36:05,716
Yes!

438
00:36:24,247 --> 00:36:26,715
Now all we have to do is find them.

439
00:36:36,367 --> 00:36:39,279
- Way to go, Boomer!
- Nice work, sir!

440
00:36:41,487 --> 00:36:44,479
- Nice job. Let's get you debriefed.
- Yes, sir.

441
00:36:48,767 --> 00:36:51,804
Chief. You think you could take a look
at my ejection pyros?

442
00:36:51,887 --> 00:36:54,162
I think there's a short.
Yeah. Cally.

443
00:36:54,247 --> 00:36:57,398
No, Chief.
You could take a look at it yourself.

444
00:37:14,287 --> 00:37:16,323
Thank you for coming, Capt. Apollo.

445
00:37:16,407 --> 00:37:18,841
I am aware that you were in charge...

446
00:37:18,927 --> 00:37:22,124
<i>of the mission
that destroyed the Olympic Carrier.</i>

447
00:37:22,487 --> 00:37:26,275
I know what a hard thing that is
to live with, for all of us.

448
00:37:27,127 --> 00:37:29,357
I'm struggling
with it myself, frankly.

449
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:31,563
I can't stop thinking about it.

450
00:37:34,887 --> 00:37:39,517
But a man has to accept responsibility
for his actions.

451
00:37:39,607 --> 00:37:42,565
He doesn't second-guess
the choices he makes.

452
00:37:43,567 --> 00:37:45,842
He lives with them. Every day.

453
00:37:47,287 --> 00:37:51,280
You know, I remember when President Adar
sent the Marines into Aerilon.

454
00:37:51,367 --> 00:37:53,119
Fifteen people died.

455
00:37:53,447 --> 00:37:56,837
In public, of course,
he had to say all the usual things.

456
00:37:56,927 --> 00:38:00,237
He was sure of what he'd done,
he made the right choice...

457
00:38:00,327 --> 00:38:02,124
he stayed the course.

458
00:38:03,407 --> 00:38:05,602
But he knew it was a mistake.

459
00:38:06,567 --> 00:38:10,355
And he kept the names of the dead
in his desk drawer.

460
00:38:10,927 --> 00:38:13,919
He said that it was imperative for a leader...

461
00:38:14,607 --> 00:38:17,485
to remember and learn from the mistakes...

462
00:38:17,687 --> 00:38:20,520
even if they can't admit to them publicly.

463
00:38:21,127 --> 00:38:25,006
- You think we made a mistake?
- I don't know.

464
00:38:29,527 --> 00:38:33,236
I don't have a desk drawer yet,
but I have a pocket.

465
00:38:44,687 --> 00:38:48,077
I don't want to add
to your burdens, however.

466
00:38:49,367 --> 00:38:53,963
I have a request. I would like you
to be my personal military advisor.

467
00:38:55,927 --> 00:38:57,280
I'm sorry.

468
00:38:58,487 --> 00:39:02,196
My father is the senior military officer.
He should advise you.

469
00:39:02,287 --> 00:39:06,519
No, I don't mean to go
behind your father's back. Nothing like that.

470
00:39:07,407 --> 00:39:12,117
I'm not looking for military advice.
I'm looking for advice about the military.

471
00:39:12,367 --> 00:39:16,838
That little insight about your father
making a gesture, that really helped me.

472
00:39:16,927 --> 00:39:21,239
It made me reassess the man.
I would appreciate more of those insights.

473
00:39:22,407 --> 00:39:25,205
And you can keep your day job at the C-A-G.

474
00:39:26,127 --> 00:39:27,958
It's pronounced "CAG."

475
00:39:29,327 --> 00:39:31,397
Do you see why I need you?

476
00:39:34,607 --> 00:39:36,996
So who's going to tell my father?

477
00:39:37,447 --> 00:39:38,880
Well...

478
00:39:42,327 --> 00:39:44,204
I was thinking that...

479
00:39:45,447 --> 00:39:47,802
that would be your first assignment.

480
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,879
Somehow I knew you were going to say that.

481
00:39:53,407 --> 00:39:55,159
Thank you, Captain.

482
00:39:59,407 --> 00:40:00,396
Hey.

483
00:40:08,167 --> 00:40:10,635
That is just what I needed.
Oh, yeah?

484
00:40:12,367 --> 00:40:14,835
- Did you find that detonator?
- Yes, I did.

485
00:40:14,927 --> 00:40:16,883
- I gave it to master-at-arms.
- What?

486
00:40:16,967 --> 00:40:19,640
No, no.
I told her I found it during maintenance.

487
00:40:19,727 --> 00:40:23,959
Listen, calm down.
This is the best way to go about this. Okay?

488
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:26,242
That puts them on the same trail we're on...

489
00:40:26,327 --> 00:40:28,443
and it doesn't raise any suspicion of you.

490
00:40:28,527 --> 00:40:30,882
Listen. Trust me on this, Sharon.

491
00:40:31,167 --> 00:40:34,398
I'm not going to let anything happen to you.
Okay?

492
00:40:35,047 --> 00:40:36,958
- Okay.
- All right, okay.

493
00:40:39,207 --> 00:40:41,004
Don't worry, sweetie.

494
00:40:42,647 --> 00:40:44,603
- I better go.
- All right.
