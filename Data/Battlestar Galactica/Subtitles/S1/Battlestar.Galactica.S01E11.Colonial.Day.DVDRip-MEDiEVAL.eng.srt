1
00:00:01,767 --> 00:00:04,725
<i>Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.</i>

2
00:00:41,447 --> 00:00:43,881
What the hell is going on?
You killed her.

3
00:00:43,967 --> 00:00:46,003
We gotta go. Right now.

4
00:00:46,887 --> 00:00:48,798
That's Tom Zarek.
The terrorist?

5
00:00:48,887 --> 00:00:51,321
He's a prisoner of conscience.
He's a butcher.

6
00:00:51,407 --> 00:00:54,399
<i>He blew up a government building,
there is no excuse for that.</i>

7
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:56,079
I thought you said you respected me.

8
00:00:56,167 --> 00:00:59,045
That was before you resorted
to violence and hostage-taking.

9
00:00:59,127 --> 00:01:03,757
<i>I demand the immediate resignation
of Laura Roslin and her ministers.</i>

10
00:01:04,207 --> 00:01:07,483
I demand free and open elections
to choose a new leadership.

11
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:11,879
If you let the rest of these hostages go,
we will leave this ship in your hands.

12
00:01:20,487 --> 00:01:23,206
McMANUS: Got it?
Test. There.

13
00:01:24,127 --> 00:01:26,766
McMANUS: Are we on?
Frack, we're on. Go.

14
00:01:26,847 --> 00:01:29,884
<i>McMANUS: Live from Cloud Nine,
the most luxurious ship in the fleet...</i>

15
00:01:29,967 --> 00:01:31,082
<i>it's The Colonial Gang.</i>

16
00:01:31,167 --> 00:01:34,318
It's a new talk show that brings you
the inside scoop on the fleet.

17
00:01:34,407 --> 00:01:36,716
<i>I'm James McManus,
formerly of the Caprica Times.</i>

18
00:01:36,807 --> 00:01:40,083
With me are two of the only remaining
legitimate journalists left.

19
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:43,603
<i>Playa Palacios, veteran commentator
for the Picon Star Tribune. Welcome.</i>

20
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:47,077
<i>And my wingman, Sekou Hamilton,
former editor of the Aerilon Gazette.</i>

21
00:01:47,167 --> 00:01:48,964
<i>McMANUS: As most
people know...</i>

22
00:01:49,047 --> 00:01:51,117
<i>Cloud Nine was damaged
during a Cylon attack...</i>

23
00:01:51,207 --> 00:01:52,196
<i>and had to be evacuated.</i>

24
00:01:52,287 --> 00:01:55,597
<i>With repairs now complete,
President Roslin has picked it as the site...</i>

25
00:01:55,687 --> 00:01:56,881
<i>for an historic gathering.</i>

26
00:01:56,967 --> 00:01:59,561
<i>It's the first meeting
of the Interim Quorum of 12...</i>

27
00:01:59,647 --> 00:02:01,444
<i>which will coincide with Colonial Day...</i>

28
00:02:01,527 --> 00:02:04,724
<i>the 52nd anniversary of the signing
of the Articles of Colonisation.</i>

29
00:02:04,807 --> 00:02:06,160
<i>Playa, why don't you weigh in?</i>

30
00:02:06,247 --> 00:02:07,919
Laura Roslin should be applauded...

31
00:02:08,007 --> 00:02:10,840
for restoring
the system of checks and balances.

32
00:02:10,927 --> 00:02:13,919
<i>McMANUS: Every delegate chosen so far
has been a Roslin crony.</i>

33
00:02:14,007 --> 00:02:15,759
<i>It's a puppet Quorum, okay?</i>

34
00:02:15,847 --> 00:02:19,886
That will rubber-stamp every edict
this power-mad schoolteacher will try...

35
00:02:19,967 --> 00:02:23,118
How can you say that when half the Quorum
hasn't even been selected?

36
00:02:23,207 --> 00:02:26,040
<i>McMANUS: I predict every one of them
will be a Roslin lackey...</i>

37
00:02:26,127 --> 00:02:29,836
<i>hand-picked by the power behind the throne,
Presidential Advisor, Wallace Gray.</i>

38
00:02:29,927 --> 00:02:32,919
<i>Don't you see,
Gray orchestrated this whole publicity stunt.</i>

39
00:02:33,007 --> 00:02:36,317
Come on, Jim.
Wallace Gray is no prince of darkness.

40
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:37,476
I disagree.

41
00:02:37,567 --> 00:02:39,876
He's helped Roslin
regulate the internal economy...

42
00:02:39,967 --> 00:02:43,164
made sure vital food and medical supplies
were fairly distributed...

43
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:47,525
He's a gasbag who's made a fortune through
deals Quorum members have profited from.

44
00:02:47,607 --> 00:02:48,926
Freedom of the press.

45
00:02:49,007 --> 00:02:50,326
<i>McMANUS: As we speak...</i>

46
00:02:50,407 --> 00:02:54,685
Madam President, the fatuous gasbag
would like 5 minutes of your time.

47
00:02:54,767 --> 00:02:55,995
Wally.

48
00:02:57,887 --> 00:03:01,004
How does it feel to be a celebrity?
Well, I love it.

49
00:03:01,087 --> 00:03:03,442
They'll probably be calling me a fascist next.

50
00:03:03,527 --> 00:03:06,200
No, I'm the fascist.
You stick with being the gasbag.

51
00:03:06,287 --> 00:03:09,723
Madam President, excuse me,
you're going to want to hear this.

52
00:03:10,327 --> 00:03:14,878
<i>McMANUS:... Sagittaron have chosen their
delegate for the Interim Quorum of 12.</i>

53
00:03:14,967 --> 00:03:16,685
<i>Who would've guessed it? Tom Zarek.</i>

54
00:03:16,767 --> 00:03:19,406
- Oh, my gods.
- He's got quite a following out there.

55
00:03:19,487 --> 00:03:22,843
- I should have seen this coming.
- He's a terrorist. Who are they kidding?

56
00:03:22,927 --> 00:03:24,326
<i>McMANUS:... a ruthless terrorist.</i>

57
00:03:24,407 --> 00:03:28,480
<i>Tom Zarek incited a prison riot
that resulted in kidnapping, attempted rape.</i>

58
00:03:28,567 --> 00:03:32,321
He blew up a government building and now
he's gonna sit on the Quorum of 12?

59
00:03:32,407 --> 00:03:35,638
<i>McMANUS: Wrong. The government
trumped up charges to discredit a man...</i>

60
00:03:35,727 --> 00:03:38,560
<i>who's dedicated his life
for the disenfranchised.</i>

61
00:03:39,287 --> 00:03:40,879
Yes? Just a moment.

62
00:03:40,967 --> 00:03:43,720
Commander Adama.
Why am I not surprised?

63
00:03:45,327 --> 00:03:47,841
<i>Hello, Commander.
Are you listening to this?</i>

64
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:51,078
- Indeed.
- Can't allow a terrorist to sit in government.

65
00:03:51,167 --> 00:03:54,284
<i>My hands are tied.
I don't want to turn him into a martyr.</i>

66
00:03:54,687 --> 00:03:59,238
Sagittaron law allows a prisoner to regain
his citizenship once he's served his time.

67
00:03:59,327 --> 00:04:02,478
Tom Zarek represents
a danger to the entire fleet.

68
00:04:02,567 --> 00:04:06,116
<i>I can bar him from travelling to Cloud Nine
on that basis alone.</i>

69
00:04:06,207 --> 00:04:09,722
I perfectly understand the threat
Tom Zarek represents.

70
00:04:09,807 --> 00:04:14,119
But the last thing I need is for you to start
acting like my own personal goon squad.

71
00:04:14,207 --> 00:04:16,960
We need to let this play out. Thank you.

72
00:04:19,007 --> 00:04:21,885
<i>McMANUS: Hold onto your shorts.
There's another story.</i>

73
00:04:21,967 --> 00:04:24,037
<i>We're getting a live feed
from the Astral Queen.</i>

74
00:04:24,127 --> 00:04:26,436
<i>Tom Zarek is about to make a statement.</i>

75
00:04:28,247 --> 00:04:32,798
Citizens of the 12 Colonies, I am
humbled and moved by this great honour.

76
00:04:33,527 --> 00:04:37,315
I will be a voice
for those who have gone too long unheard...

77
00:04:37,407 --> 00:04:41,116
by a government that serves
only the privileged and the powerful...

78
00:04:41,527 --> 00:04:44,883
that turns a blind eye
to the needs of the weak and the poor.

79
00:04:46,407 --> 00:04:50,559
But Roslin and her confederates
will no longer be able to ignore us.

80
00:04:51,247 --> 00:04:55,525
<i>People of the fleet,
look up. The winds of change are blowing.</i>

81
00:04:56,127 --> 00:04:58,766
<i>A new era is about to dawn.</i>

82
00:06:02,127 --> 00:06:03,401
Hey, Doc.

83
00:06:03,887 --> 00:06:06,720
Lt. Thrace, to what do I owe this honour?

84
00:06:07,247 --> 00:06:11,081
<i>Our shuttle leaves for Cloud Nine
at 05:12 tomorrow, so don't be late.</i>

85
00:06:11,167 --> 00:06:12,441
"Our" shuttle?

86
00:06:13,447 --> 00:06:15,836
A surprise getaway? Just the two of you?

87
00:06:17,807 --> 00:06:22,039
- I'm going to be handling your security.
- Please don't touch that. Thank you.

88
00:06:22,727 --> 00:06:25,799
Security for what?
You haven't heard?

89
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,718
It's all over talk wireless.

90
00:06:29,087 --> 00:06:31,885
When would I have the chance
to listen to talk wireless?

91
00:06:31,967 --> 00:06:34,276
I have 60 years of work in front of me.

92
00:06:34,447 --> 00:06:38,963
Anyway, talk wireless is just an excuse
for lowbrow rabble-rousing.

93
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:43,596
You've been selected as Caprica's delegate
to the Quorum of 12.

94
00:06:43,687 --> 00:06:44,836
Me?

95
00:06:48,087 --> 00:06:50,157
Is this some kind of joke?

96
00:06:50,607 --> 00:06:54,077
Guess you got the super-genius vote.
No accounting for taste.

97
00:06:54,367 --> 00:06:57,404
Congratulations, Doctor.
Thank you.

98
00:07:00,127 --> 00:07:03,403
Politics is the only thing more boring
than blood samples.

99
00:07:03,487 --> 00:07:07,765
All those interminable speeches.
All that dreary pomp.

100
00:07:08,967 --> 00:07:12,562
Parties full of young women
drawn to men of power.

101
00:07:14,727 --> 00:07:17,560
But when the people call, you must serve.

102
00:07:22,287 --> 00:07:26,405
I can't remember the last time
I felt the sunlight on my face.

103
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:29,839
<i>Sure feels good. Almost like the real thing.</i>

104
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:38,243
They could've done a better job
with the horizon, though.

105
00:07:40,207 --> 00:07:42,163
Security's going to be a bitch.

106
00:07:42,647 --> 00:07:45,525
A thousand different places
for a sniper to hide.

107
00:07:45,607 --> 00:07:47,359
How many people are we dealing with?

108
00:07:47,447 --> 00:07:49,199
Five hundred plus.

109
00:07:49,287 --> 00:07:53,041
Each colony's
sending a delegation of leading citizens.

110
00:07:53,127 --> 00:07:57,040
Great. Herds of lookie-loos,
any one of whom could be a Cylon.

111
00:07:57,607 --> 00:08:01,725
Toasters aren't our only problem.
Don't you pay any attention to politics?

112
00:08:01,807 --> 00:08:04,116
- No.
- A lot of unrest out there.

113
00:08:05,447 --> 00:08:08,245
So why is Roslin insisting
on letting so many people come?

114
00:08:08,327 --> 00:08:10,477
I guess she thinks it's important to them...

115
00:08:10,567 --> 00:08:12,922
to be able to observe
how their government works.

116
00:08:13,007 --> 00:08:16,317
So basically,
she's already running for re-election.

117
00:08:16,807 --> 00:08:18,001
No, Kara.

118
00:08:19,367 --> 00:08:21,517
Kara, give me that.

119
00:08:35,527 --> 00:08:37,882
Thank you, sir.
Enjoy your day.

120
00:08:38,647 --> 00:08:40,399
The atmosphere is electric...

121
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:42,682
as Quorum members arrive
with their delegations.

122
00:08:42,767 --> 00:08:44,485
<i>I'm outside the Cloud Nine Ballroom...</i>

123
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:47,320
<i>where the reception of
the new Quorum of 12 will take place.</i>

124
00:08:47,407 --> 00:08:50,399
<i>The question is, will President Roslin
shake the hand of the man...</i>

125
00:08:50,487 --> 00:08:52,159
many still regard as a terrorist...

126
00:08:52,247 --> 00:08:56,126
or will she snub him, and by extension,
all the people of Sagittaron?

127
00:08:57,487 --> 00:08:58,806
Col. Tigh.

128
00:08:59,767 --> 00:09:02,156
- My wife Ellen.
- Welcome aboard.

129
00:09:02,767 --> 00:09:04,359
Kill me now.

130
00:09:05,567 --> 00:09:06,886
Col. Tigh.

131
00:09:14,447 --> 00:09:17,439
Starbuck, Apollo. Zarek's here.
Copy.

132
00:09:17,527 --> 00:09:20,803
Don't worry. This guy's mine
the second he makes a wrong move.

133
00:09:20,887 --> 00:09:23,879
<i>Yeah?
Well, you'll have to beat me to him.</i>

134
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:28,040
Murderer. You don't belong here, Zarek.
Go back.

135
00:09:28,127 --> 00:09:31,324
What did you say?
He's not a murderer, he's a freedom fighter.

136
00:09:31,407 --> 00:09:33,363
All right?
Excuse me.

137
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:37,119
- May I see your security pass, sir?
- Not a problem.

138
00:09:37,207 --> 00:09:40,404
I'm a citizen of Sagittaron.
I've got every legal right to be here.

139
00:09:40,487 --> 00:09:42,682
Your rights don't extend
to roughing people up.

140
00:09:42,767 --> 00:09:47,124
<i>Lay a hand on anyone else and you'll be
getting to know Galactica's brig.</i>

141
00:09:47,207 --> 00:09:50,597
<i>Well, everything's in order.
Enjoy your stay on Cloud Nine.</i>

142
00:09:50,687 --> 00:09:52,040
Oh, I will.

143
00:09:58,007 --> 00:10:01,841
<i>Tom Zarek.
Col. Tigh, Battlestar Galactica.</i>

144
00:10:03,487 --> 00:10:04,681
I see.

145
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,715
My wife.

146
00:10:09,687 --> 00:10:12,520
- Does she have a name?
- Ellen.

147
00:10:14,407 --> 00:10:17,444
Call me Tom.
I don't like to stand on ceremony.

148
00:10:17,527 --> 00:10:20,087
I'm the same way.
All this pretension makes me sick.

149
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:22,237
You're holding up the line.

150
00:10:24,887 --> 00:10:27,003
Thank you
for making me feel welcome, Ellen.

151
00:10:27,087 --> 00:10:29,043
I hope to see you again.

152
00:10:30,767 --> 00:10:32,519
Why did you do that?

153
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:38,883
To get our picture on the front page of every
newsletter and photo service in the fleet.

154
00:10:38,967 --> 00:10:41,276
I don't need my picture taken with a terrorist.

155
00:10:41,367 --> 00:10:43,961
Wake up, Saul. Look at these cameras.

156
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:50,680
Roslin's the past, Zarek's the future.
A blind man can see that.

157
00:10:54,647 --> 00:10:56,877
Madam President.
Mr. Zarek.

158
00:10:58,847 --> 00:11:02,078
If I were to offer you my hand in friendship...

159
00:11:03,047 --> 00:11:04,446
would you take it?

160
00:11:04,727 --> 00:11:07,036
Well, there's only one way to find out.

161
00:11:16,087 --> 00:11:18,521
That was nicely played.
Thank you.

162
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:22,163
Just remember, I'm not your enemy,
Madam President.

163
00:11:23,207 --> 00:11:27,200
And I know today's agenda
is rather large...

164
00:11:27,727 --> 00:11:31,037
but I think that if you'll look
at the scheduled meetings...

165
00:11:31,127 --> 00:11:34,164
you'll see that
they concern issues vital to the fleet.

166
00:11:34,247 --> 00:11:36,602
<i>In some cases, existing policies...</i>

167
00:11:36,687 --> 00:11:40,316
<i>regarding matters such as
the distribution of medical supplies...</i>

168
00:11:40,407 --> 00:11:43,524
You're missing
an intriguing opportunity.

169
00:11:45,047 --> 00:11:47,481
Playa's not wearing any underwear.

170
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,399
Don't be absurd.

171
00:11:52,407 --> 00:11:53,601
Really?

172
00:11:55,567 --> 00:11:57,717
She's been eyeing you all afternoon.

173
00:12:06,887 --> 00:12:08,843
She's certainly human.

174
00:12:11,087 --> 00:12:12,805
You're not jealous?

175
00:12:13,087 --> 00:12:14,964
Love isn't about sex, Gaius.

176
00:12:15,047 --> 00:12:17,561
That's an enlightened point of view.

177
00:12:17,807 --> 00:12:19,365
I've been thinking...

178
00:12:20,247 --> 00:12:23,319
as far as I'm concerned
you can have any woman you want.

179
00:12:23,567 --> 00:12:25,398
But always remember...

180
00:12:26,327 --> 00:12:27,999
I have your heart.

181
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,398
Yes. Of course you do.

182
00:12:32,247 --> 00:12:35,125
I can always rip it out of your chest
if I need to.

183
00:12:37,127 --> 00:12:39,641
So if there are no objections...

184
00:12:39,727 --> 00:12:44,243
the Chair will entertain motions
to accept today's agenda as proposed.

185
00:12:44,327 --> 00:12:46,158
I have an objection.

186
00:12:49,407 --> 00:12:51,477
The chair recognises Sagittaron.

187
00:12:51,567 --> 00:12:54,957
All the items on your agenda are important,
I agree.

188
00:12:55,407 --> 00:13:00,242
Ration distribution, education,
medical services, all very important.

189
00:13:00,327 --> 00:13:02,682
<i>But I'm frankly shocked to discover...</i>

190
00:13:02,767 --> 00:13:05,679
the most critical issue of all
is nowhere to be found.

191
00:13:05,767 --> 00:13:09,123
Really? Well, perhaps
Mr. Zarek could enlighten us?

192
00:13:10,407 --> 00:13:12,841
The election of a vice-president.

193
00:13:13,367 --> 00:13:16,837
If, gods forbid, anything
should happen to you, Madam President...

194
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:19,282
we have no designated successor.

195
00:13:19,607 --> 00:13:22,883
<i>The civilian branch of our government
would be paralysed...</i>

196
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:26,437
leaving the door wide open
for a military dictatorship.

197
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:30,720
Sagittaron moves that
the first item on the Quorum's agenda...

198
00:13:31,367 --> 00:13:34,165
should be nominations for vice-president.

199
00:13:36,767 --> 00:13:38,200
Second.

200
00:13:39,687 --> 00:13:42,406
- Second.
- Second.

201
00:13:50,327 --> 00:13:53,558
Caprica seconds for various reasons...

202
00:13:54,327 --> 00:13:58,081
which are far too obvious
and numerous to go into right now.

203
00:13:58,487 --> 00:14:03,356
But certainly, I think we can all agree
that it'd be a good idea to have a successor.

204
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:07,601
The motion has been moved and seconded.

205
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:12,762
<i>All those in favour of opening nominations
for the vice-presidency, say aye.</i>

206
00:14:12,847 --> 00:14:15,356
Aye.

207
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,126
The ayes have it.

208
00:14:17,207 --> 00:14:21,086
The floor is now open for nominations.
The chair recognises Virgon.

209
00:14:22,327 --> 00:14:24,795
Now, there is only one man here...

210
00:14:24,887 --> 00:14:28,960
who is willing to work for the betterment
of people in this fleet.

211
00:14:29,127 --> 00:14:30,958
When I asked for his help...

212
00:14:31,927 --> 00:14:35,124
he sent a crew
to fix the air filtration system on my ship...

213
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:38,722
and, hell, they were finished and gone
while I was still waiting...

214
00:14:38,807 --> 00:14:41,799
for the President's office to return my call.

215
00:14:42,087 --> 00:14:44,362
I nominate Tom Zarek.

216
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:47,440
Thanks.

217
00:14:52,007 --> 00:14:53,679
Is there a second?

218
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:56,402
Gemenon seconds the nomination.

219
00:14:56,727 --> 00:15:00,879
The nomination of Tom Zarek
for the vice-presidency has been accepted.

220
00:15:02,247 --> 00:15:06,877
The Chair will remain open for 72 hours
for nominations.

221
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,084
The session is now adjourned.

222
00:15:22,207 --> 00:15:25,563
Thomas Zarek
is not going to be my vice-president.

223
00:15:25,647 --> 00:15:29,560
Six months until the presidential election.
We could've handpicked a candidate.

224
00:15:29,647 --> 00:15:31,922
It didn't shock me
when Bagot nominated him.

225
00:15:32,007 --> 00:15:34,441
- But Porter, that was surprising.
- Not really.

226
00:15:34,527 --> 00:15:37,564
The Gemenon ships use more water
per capita than any other ship.

227
00:15:37,647 --> 00:15:39,365
She wanted more rations, I said no.

228
00:15:39,447 --> 00:15:42,086
Zarek may have made some friends
in the last few weeks...

229
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:44,158
but there are still plenty who hate him.

230
00:15:44,247 --> 00:15:46,317
Don't underestimate Zarek.

231
00:15:46,607 --> 00:15:48,837
He's charismatic
and knows what buttons to push.

232
00:15:48,927 --> 00:15:52,761
<i>Frankly, Madam President, I am concerned
about the security aboard Cloud Nine.</i>

233
00:15:52,847 --> 00:15:55,122
I want you leaning forward
on this, Captain.

234
00:15:55,207 --> 00:15:57,880
If they even sneeze,
they better have a handkerchief.

235
00:15:57,967 --> 00:15:59,400
Understood.

236
00:16:02,807 --> 00:16:04,320
We need a candidate.

237
00:16:04,407 --> 00:16:06,921
Someone who will
quickly win the delegates' support.

238
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,759
An established name.

239
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,081
I'm not a politician.

240
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:18,044
But you know
how to get things done.

241
00:16:18,127 --> 00:16:20,516
You've kept this fleet functioning
all this time.

242
00:16:20,607 --> 00:16:23,519
No. Thanks, but...

243
00:16:27,807 --> 00:16:32,562
I can't allow Tom Zarek to be one heartbeat
away from the presidency, Wally.

244
00:16:34,087 --> 00:16:35,520
I need you.

245
00:16:39,607 --> 00:16:41,438
You've got me, Madam President.

246
00:16:41,847 --> 00:16:46,045
How can you reassure people that
you're looking out for their interests...

247
00:16:46,127 --> 00:16:48,766
as opposed to the rehabilitation
of Tom Zarek?

248
00:16:48,847 --> 00:16:51,520
That's a great question, Playa.
This is how I see it.

249
00:16:51,607 --> 00:16:55,646
We're facing a situation so unique,
so specific...

250
00:16:56,207 --> 00:16:59,119
that I believe
we need not only new leadership...

251
00:16:59,207 --> 00:17:01,482
but a whole new way of thinking.

252
00:17:01,567 --> 00:17:03,717
Like blowing up a building or two?

253
00:17:03,807 --> 00:17:06,480
If things weren't so serious,
I'd say that was funny.

254
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:09,604
Look, there's no economy.
There's no market. No industry.

255
00:17:09,687 --> 00:17:11,962
No capital. Money is worthless.

256
00:17:12,487 --> 00:17:16,196
And yet, we're all held hostage
by the idea of the way things used to be.

257
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,686
Look where we are.

258
00:17:18,407 --> 00:17:21,240
This man wakes up every morning...

259
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:24,804
tugs on his boots
and goes to work in this garden.

260
00:17:25,527 --> 00:17:29,202
<i>Why?
Because it's his job? What job?</i>

261
00:17:29,327 --> 00:17:31,966
<i>He labours,
but he gets no benefit from his labour.</i>

262
00:17:32,047 --> 00:17:33,446
<i>He's not the only one.</i>

263
00:17:33,527 --> 00:17:37,315
Many of us are just still going
through the motions of our old lives.

264
00:17:37,407 --> 00:17:40,683
The lawyers still act like lawyers,
but they have no clients.

265
00:17:40,767 --> 00:17:44,077
<i>Businessmen still act like
businessmen, but have no business.</i>

266
00:17:44,407 --> 00:17:49,197
President Roslin and her policies
are all about holding on to a fantasy.

267
00:17:50,447 --> 00:17:54,201
<i>If we want to survive,
we need to completely restructure our lives.</i>

268
00:17:54,287 --> 00:17:57,006
We need to think
about the community of citizens.

269
00:17:57,087 --> 00:17:59,317
The group, not the individual.

270
00:18:00,007 --> 00:18:04,762
We need to completely free ourselves
of the past and operate as a collective.

271
00:18:05,767 --> 00:18:09,316
You're not interested in the citizens.
You just want power.

272
00:18:09,407 --> 00:18:11,238
Turn that crap off.

273
00:18:14,407 --> 00:18:16,602
I was listening to that broadcast.

274
00:18:16,687 --> 00:18:18,200
You again?

275
00:18:19,207 --> 00:18:20,720
That's a shame.

276
00:18:20,887 --> 00:18:24,118
They want to hear Mr. Zarek speak, too.
Don't you, buddy?

277
00:18:24,207 --> 00:18:25,959
See? He wants to hear Mr. Zarek.

278
00:18:26,047 --> 00:18:29,005
How about you?
You want to hear what Mr. Zarek has to say?

279
00:18:29,087 --> 00:18:30,759
I don't mind one way or the other.

280
00:18:30,847 --> 00:18:33,042
Well, I take that as a yes. So turn it on.

281
00:18:33,127 --> 00:18:34,799
- Now.
- Leave it.

282
00:18:35,567 --> 00:18:39,355
Mr. Zarek is a representative of the people
and we are the people.

283
00:18:39,607 --> 00:18:42,599
Well, you're people. Sort of.

284
00:18:42,687 --> 00:18:44,996
You know, I don't like your tone,
flyboy...

285
00:18:45,087 --> 00:18:49,638
so why don't you just move along out of here
and go enjoy the imitation weather?

286
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:53,641
I'd be happy to, after you leave.

287
00:18:56,167 --> 00:18:57,646
Which is now.

288
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,081
Okay.

289
00:19:02,967 --> 00:19:04,844
Don't want no trouble.

290
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,966
What the hell.

291
00:19:51,687 --> 00:19:52,961
There's a gun.

292
00:19:57,167 --> 00:19:58,759
Starbuck.

293
00:20:00,687 --> 00:20:02,405
Incoming.

294
00:20:12,407 --> 00:20:14,125
Are you looking for this?

295
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:29,726
The Telamon Building's still standing.
That's Delphi, all right.

296
00:20:35,207 --> 00:20:38,165
Now, all we have to do is wait until dark...

297
00:20:39,007 --> 00:20:42,682
infiltrate the most heavily fortified
military hub on this planet...

298
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:46,478
hope the Cylons haven't
completely wasted the spaceport...

299
00:20:46,567 --> 00:20:50,321
<i>steal a ship, locate Galactica
and fly to her without getting shot to hell.</i>

300
00:20:50,407 --> 00:20:52,125
- Is that all?
- Yeah.

301
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:58,166
I guess we can relax until dark.
Might as well make ourselves comfortable.

302
00:20:58,247 --> 00:21:02,035
You hungry?
No, not right now.

303
00:21:06,087 --> 00:21:08,681
Your stomach's feeling better?
Starving.

304
00:21:09,847 --> 00:21:13,840
I'm trying to make sense out of
the two women we saw with the Cylons.

305
00:21:14,687 --> 00:21:15,756
And?

306
00:21:17,367 --> 00:21:20,200
I can't fathom why anybody
would wanna help the toasters.

307
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:24,326
And they just happened to be twins?
That's too weird.

308
00:21:26,287 --> 00:21:28,482
You got a better explanation?

309
00:21:32,087 --> 00:21:35,045
You think the Cylons could be messing
with human DNA?

310
00:21:35,687 --> 00:21:37,518
Cloning people or something?

311
00:21:41,007 --> 00:21:42,645
Could be.

312
00:21:43,407 --> 00:21:46,160
That would explain
how they took us by surprise.

313
00:21:46,247 --> 00:21:49,239
They had these replicated humans
infiltrating the colonies...

314
00:21:49,327 --> 00:21:51,921
laying the groundwork
for the surprise attack.

315
00:21:57,247 --> 00:21:59,920
You know, if they were human clones...

316
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:05,324
that means they're capable
of complex emotions, maybe even love.

317
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:08,638
<i>Maybe they were misguided
in the way that they were indoctrinated.</i>

318
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:12,800
Whatever they are, they're not human.
No human could do the things they've done.

319
00:22:12,887 --> 00:22:15,003
Killed billions of innocent people.

320
00:22:19,287 --> 00:22:23,121
They've got to be fracking Cylons,
just like the rest of them.

321
00:22:27,007 --> 00:22:29,123
Why do you have a summit itinerary?

322
00:22:29,887 --> 00:22:33,084
<i>Why circle every public appearance
by President Roslin?</i>

323
00:22:34,367 --> 00:22:35,641
It's not mine.

324
00:22:35,727 --> 00:22:40,243
Some stranger wandered down the hall,
picked the lock to your room and left this?

325
00:22:40,767 --> 00:22:43,361
False-bottom with anechoic coating
to absorb x-rays.

326
00:22:43,447 --> 00:22:44,960
Ceramic stealth gun.

327
00:22:45,047 --> 00:22:48,244
You sure went through a lot of trouble
to get that weapon onboard.

328
00:22:48,327 --> 00:22:51,125
I carry a lot of money. I need protection.

329
00:22:51,207 --> 00:22:52,686
Right.

330
00:22:53,047 --> 00:22:56,403
The money's worthless.
Your friend Zarek pointed that out.

331
00:22:57,007 --> 00:22:58,998
I don't even know Zarek.

332
00:23:00,727 --> 00:23:04,197
Your pal Grimes says different.
He gave you up.

333
00:23:09,567 --> 00:23:12,445
You're bluffing. You haven't got anything.

334
00:23:12,527 --> 00:23:14,518
We don't need anything, Valance.

335
00:23:17,647 --> 00:23:21,356
Because this isn't a trial.
This is just you and us in this room.

336
00:23:22,687 --> 00:23:26,202
Like Zarek pointed out,
we're living in a whole new world.

337
00:23:26,287 --> 00:23:27,606
<i>No due process.</i>

338
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:31,118
<i>This is your courtroom.</i>

339
00:23:32,847 --> 00:23:37,284
And that would make us your executioners.

340
00:23:38,207 --> 00:23:41,995
So you might want to cooperate,
or else you're going out an air lock.

341
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,362
Because that's what we do to traitors.

342
00:23:45,607 --> 00:23:47,325
Look, I...

343
00:23:49,967 --> 00:23:52,879
I just came over here
for the booze and the food.

344
00:23:52,967 --> 00:23:54,320
That's it.

345
00:23:54,527 --> 00:23:55,926
You know what? Frack you!

346
00:23:57,847 --> 00:24:01,442
We put all the heat on Valance
we could but can't tie him to Zarek.

347
00:24:01,527 --> 00:24:03,882
I know Zarek's behind this.
Keep working on Valance.

348
00:24:03,967 --> 00:24:07,642
We will. To be safe, I think you should
send the Sagittaron delegation back.

349
00:24:07,727 --> 00:24:10,878
Can't. Violates their civil rights,
plays right into Zarek's hands.

350
00:24:10,967 --> 00:24:13,003
<i>He could have another shooter
on Cloud Nine...</i>

351
00:24:13,087 --> 00:24:15,476
and if Zarek wins the vote,
he's more than capable...

352
00:24:15,567 --> 00:24:18,923
of ordering your assassination
and ascending to the presidency.

353
00:24:19,007 --> 00:24:21,965
Zarek's not going to win
because I'm not going to let him.

354
00:24:22,047 --> 00:24:26,518
Meanwhile, keep Zarek under surveillance,
tap his phones, bug his room.

355
00:24:26,767 --> 00:24:31,363
If you find anything that remotely connects
Zarek to Valance, shut him down.

356
00:24:33,207 --> 00:24:37,086
The domestic policies we've been
talking about over the last little while...

357
00:24:37,167 --> 00:24:40,557
such as employment,
housing and education...

358
00:24:40,927 --> 00:24:44,476
Latest vote count:
seven for Gray, five for Zarek.

359
00:24:46,127 --> 00:24:48,357
We're slipping. He was four an hour ago.

360
00:24:48,447 --> 00:24:51,484
- Zarek must be making promises.
- Picon flipped.

361
00:24:52,927 --> 00:24:56,442
We've got to hold
the colonies till they vote tomorrow.

362
00:24:56,527 --> 00:24:59,087
<i>On Page 33
of my mission statement...</i>

363
00:24:59,167 --> 00:25:03,957
<i>I lay out a 16-point educational programme
that the President and I have developed.</i>

364
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:07,005
<i>Individuals with four-year college degrees
will be eligible.</i>

365
00:25:07,087 --> 00:25:09,282
Hi. How are you doing? Remember me?

366
00:25:10,007 --> 00:25:12,567
We got Valance. And you're next.

367
00:25:16,127 --> 00:25:18,322
<i>Health care, it's one thing to talk...</i>

368
00:25:24,127 --> 00:25:27,119
Can I get you something?
So you work here now?

369
00:25:27,967 --> 00:25:30,686
Why should I ask the bartender
to get me a drink?

370
00:25:30,767 --> 00:25:33,156
- What's in it for him?
- A big tip.

371
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:36,125
What would he spend on?

372
00:25:36,727 --> 00:25:40,879
So, are you worried about Wallace Gray?
I hear he's ahead in the vote count.

373
00:25:41,527 --> 00:25:44,280
Whatever the people want is fine by me.

374
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:48,443
Everyone has an agenda. I know I do.

375
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:50,558
And what would that be?

376
00:25:51,807 --> 00:25:56,005
The same as yours, Tom. Me. Myself.

377
00:25:56,527 --> 00:25:59,280
And I.

378
00:26:02,847 --> 00:26:06,999
You are clearly a well-connected,
well-informed woman.

379
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:12,161
Wife of the XO.
For whatever that's worth.

380
00:26:13,287 --> 00:26:16,085
Quite a bit. Now and in the future.

381
00:26:17,127 --> 00:26:20,403
That's what I'm interested in, Tom.
My place...

382
00:26:21,527 --> 00:26:25,042
and my husband's place in the future.

383
00:26:25,967 --> 00:26:27,161
Okay.

384
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:32,646
I'm looking for a friend of mine.
His name is Valance.

385
00:26:41,327 --> 00:26:43,318
How the hell did this happen?

386
00:26:43,407 --> 00:26:45,477
We've got to get to the President.

387
00:26:53,007 --> 00:26:56,636
<i>McMANUS: We're here with
Dr. Gaius Baltar, representative of Caprica.</i>

388
00:26:56,727 --> 00:26:58,080
<i>Dr. Baltar, I had one question.</i>

389
00:26:58,167 --> 00:27:02,046
<i>Is President Roslin's political career
terminal or is there hope of resuscitating it?</i>

390
00:27:02,127 --> 00:27:04,846
Laura Roslin's political career
is very much alive...

391
00:27:04,927 --> 00:27:07,600
and to underestimate her
would be a very serious mistake.

392
00:27:07,687 --> 00:27:11,282
- You miss the limelight, don't you, Gaius?
- Yes, I have.

393
00:27:11,367 --> 00:27:14,006
- You have what, Dr. Baltar?
- Nothing. You were saying?

394
00:27:14,087 --> 00:27:17,397
You seriously believe
that this school teacher...

395
00:27:17,487 --> 00:27:19,796
is able to handle the job of presidency?

396
00:27:19,887 --> 00:27:23,482
His wrists were slashed
with broken glass from the room.

397
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:27,720
- So was it suicide or was it murder?
- It was no suicide.

398
00:27:28,327 --> 00:27:31,046
- Zarek had him killed.
- If only we could prove that.

399
00:27:31,127 --> 00:27:32,845
How'd they get past the Marine Guards?

400
00:27:32,927 --> 00:27:34,155
Through the vent.

401
00:27:34,247 --> 00:27:35,919
<i>I'm glad to hear it...</i>

402
00:27:36,007 --> 00:27:39,283
<i>because all of us have had teachers
who made an impact on our lives.</i>

403
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:42,279
History is full of examples of leaders...

404
00:27:42,487 --> 00:27:45,126
who have come
from the most humble beginnings...

405
00:27:45,207 --> 00:27:48,722
and have risen to meet the challenge
posed by cataclysmic events.

406
00:27:48,807 --> 00:27:51,685
How many people knew
where Valance was being held?

407
00:27:51,847 --> 00:27:54,566
Just the people in this room
plus two Marines.

408
00:27:54,647 --> 00:27:58,276
<i>...criticise Roslin and the tough
decisions she has to make every day.</i>

409
00:27:58,367 --> 00:28:00,722
<i>Especially, if you're someone
like Tom Zarek...</i>

410
00:28:00,807 --> 00:28:04,163
<i>who's never shouldered
any real responsibility in your life.</i>

411
00:28:04,247 --> 00:28:07,159
To be fair to Tom,
he's been in prison for the last 20 years.

412
00:28:07,247 --> 00:28:09,966
And now that he's had
a drastic personality makeover...

413
00:28:10,047 --> 00:28:13,403
he's posing like
he's the saviour to all your ills.

414
00:28:14,087 --> 00:28:15,998
I think you all have a short memory.

415
00:28:16,087 --> 00:28:17,918
Well, someone talked.

416
00:28:18,047 --> 00:28:21,596
And now we have no assassin,
no evidence of a plot...

417
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:25,723
no check on Zarek, no nothing.

418
00:28:26,847 --> 00:28:29,645
If he can get to Valance,
he can get to anyone.

419
00:28:29,727 --> 00:28:33,402
Madam President, he will definitely try
and take a shot at you now.

420
00:28:33,927 --> 00:28:35,519
Only if he wins the vote.

421
00:28:35,607 --> 00:28:39,441
What I have to say is, we must survive.

422
00:28:41,127 --> 00:28:42,924
<i>And we will survive.</i>

423
00:28:43,487 --> 00:28:47,685
And we will do so through the values
that have made our colonies great.

424
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:50,839
<i>Courage. Truth. Justice. Liberty.</i>

425
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:55,957
With a firm and deep resolve
to make tomorrow better.

426
00:28:56,047 --> 00:28:59,198
Not just for ourselves, but for our children.

427
00:29:02,087 --> 00:29:05,841
Madam President, I still worry
the vote may be trending against you.

428
00:29:05,927 --> 00:29:07,280
Yes, it is.

429
00:29:07,927 --> 00:29:09,883
But I'm going to win this thing.

430
00:29:10,287 --> 00:29:14,166
And Tom Zarek is going back
to his prison ship where he belongs.

431
00:29:14,247 --> 00:29:17,319
But first I have
two very unpleasant duties to perform.

432
00:29:17,407 --> 00:29:19,716
<i>I need a shuttle to Cloud Nine.</i>

433
00:29:23,447 --> 00:29:25,483
What am I supposed to say?

434
00:29:27,887 --> 00:29:31,482
- Health reasons.
- Oh, right, fine. Health reasons.

435
00:29:33,047 --> 00:29:35,356
You know, all those years...

436
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:39,716
I watched you working with Adar.

437
00:29:39,807 --> 00:29:42,560
You were always so quiet, so polite...

438
00:29:43,087 --> 00:29:44,520
so dignified.

439
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:50,479
I never thought you'd fit in with
the bare-knuckled, backstabbing politicians.

440
00:29:51,967 --> 00:29:53,764
I guess I was wrong.

441
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:10,760
All clear.

442
00:30:13,247 --> 00:30:15,397
Dr. Baltar? Are you in here?

443
00:30:23,207 --> 00:30:24,686
Madam President?

444
00:30:31,047 --> 00:30:35,120
I heard you on the wireless.
You were very articulate, quite engaging.

445
00:30:35,807 --> 00:30:37,445
Oh, thank you.

446
00:30:37,527 --> 00:30:39,483
That's very encouraging.

447
00:30:39,567 --> 00:30:43,924
Yeah, I was just trying to do my bit
as the elected representative of Caprica.

448
00:30:45,447 --> 00:30:50,202
Besides, I'm beginning
to get a real feel for politics.

449
00:30:52,927 --> 00:30:55,919
So I take it you're not voting for Mr. Zarek?

450
00:30:56,167 --> 00:30:59,477
A man who uses his intelligence
and resources to blow up buildings...

451
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:01,603
doesn't get my vote, no.

452
00:31:01,687 --> 00:31:04,997
No, I'm voting for your man Gray.
He's really great.

453
00:31:06,567 --> 00:31:09,479
He is great, which is why he's got my vote.

454
00:31:10,687 --> 00:31:12,279
Unfortunately...

455
00:31:12,367 --> 00:31:15,086
Mr. Gray dropped out of the race.

456
00:31:15,447 --> 00:31:19,201
- Then who do you want me to vote for?
- I was thinking you.

457
00:31:19,327 --> 00:31:20,806
Me?

458
00:31:22,287 --> 00:31:24,960
- Look...
- Doctor, let's cut to the chase.

459
00:31:26,567 --> 00:31:29,559
You're a very popular man
these days.

460
00:31:29,727 --> 00:31:32,764
I would be fortunate to have
your intellect...

461
00:31:33,167 --> 00:31:36,204
and your popularity right by my side.

462
00:31:38,367 --> 00:31:40,927
Under those circumstances, I accept.

463
00:31:46,607 --> 00:31:49,201
Thank you, Madam President.
Thank you.

464
00:31:57,607 --> 00:32:00,804
Wow. What are you going to do now?

465
00:32:01,767 --> 00:32:02,995
Now...

466
00:32:05,487 --> 00:32:07,955
I'm going to give you an exclusive.

467
00:32:09,367 --> 00:32:11,039
After you.

468
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:22,282
So what are we supposed to do?
Sit on our hands and watch her get killed?

469
00:32:22,367 --> 00:32:26,326
Zarek's too smart to take another shot
at the President during the summit.

470
00:32:26,407 --> 00:32:29,399
If he wins the vote,
he can take her out later...

471
00:32:29,887 --> 00:32:32,276
when everyone's forgotten about Valance.

472
00:32:32,687 --> 00:32:35,326
He'll just bide his time
to find a better opportunity.

473
00:32:35,407 --> 00:32:36,556
That's great.

474
00:32:38,647 --> 00:32:41,445
Anyway, she says
she's not going to lose the vote.

475
00:32:41,887 --> 00:32:43,878
She says a lot of things.

476
00:32:46,527 --> 00:32:48,438
Don't you think you should wash that?

477
00:32:48,527 --> 00:32:50,119
I did.

478
00:32:50,527 --> 00:32:52,165
Like when, a month ago?

479
00:32:52,607 --> 00:32:55,804
- Do you have a problem with my hygiene?
- You have hygiene?

480
00:32:56,967 --> 00:32:59,356
I clean up good sometimes, all right?

481
00:32:59,887 --> 00:33:02,242
Well, let me know
when it's one of those times.

482
00:33:06,007 --> 00:33:08,805
Tauron, Gaius Baltar.

483
00:33:10,407 --> 00:33:12,318
The surprises just keep on coming.

484
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:15,558
A number of the Quorum delegates
have now shifted their support...

485
00:33:15,647 --> 00:33:17,000
to the scientific genius...

486
00:33:17,087 --> 00:33:20,443
a man who is credited with saving
the fleet on numerous occasions.

487
00:33:20,527 --> 00:33:22,677
At this point, Jim, it is anyone's guess...

488
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:26,760
as to who's going to win,
but my money is on Gaius. Dr. Baltar.

489
00:33:28,687 --> 00:33:31,042
Aquaria, Thomas Zarek.

490
00:33:39,087 --> 00:33:40,520
Aerilon:

491
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:45,966
Tom Zarek.

492
00:33:46,887 --> 00:33:49,845
The vote is now six-five
in favour of Tom Zarek.

493
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:52,521
<i>The next vote
will determine our new vice-president.</i>

494
00:33:52,607 --> 00:33:54,359
<i>If Zarek gets it, he wins.</i>

495
00:33:54,447 --> 00:33:58,440
<i>In the event of a tie,
the President will cast the deciding vote.</i>

496
00:34:10,527 --> 00:34:11,926
Citizens...

497
00:34:12,047 --> 00:34:15,403
I give you your new vice-president,
Dr. Gaius Baltar.

498
00:34:28,407 --> 00:34:31,205
The perks of power, Mr. Vice-President.

499
00:34:31,807 --> 00:34:34,196
We're going to do great things together.

500
00:34:34,287 --> 00:34:38,280
Good. It's difficult to fathom.
I never aspired to power.

501
00:34:38,807 --> 00:34:42,004
Of course you didn't, Gaius.
But someone had to step up.

502
00:34:42,087 --> 00:34:44,965
- Well, after what Laura told me...
- Laura?

503
00:34:45,047 --> 00:34:47,720
Yeah, we're on
a first name basis now.

504
00:34:47,807 --> 00:34:52,562
Now look, I think the people need me.

505
00:34:53,287 --> 00:34:54,640
Excuse us.

506
00:35:06,847 --> 00:35:07,962
So...

507
00:35:08,287 --> 00:35:10,960
that bum knee of yours
is looking pretty good.

508
00:35:12,567 --> 00:35:15,240
And the other one's not too bad either.

509
00:35:15,327 --> 00:35:18,558
Lee, if you want to ask me to dance,
just ask.

510
00:35:22,207 --> 00:35:23,879
You want to dance?

511
00:35:24,967 --> 00:35:27,765
Me in a dress
is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

512
00:35:33,087 --> 00:35:35,555
- Madam President.
- Mr. Zarek.

513
00:35:35,927 --> 00:35:38,999
Oh, don't worry,
I won't be kissing you today.

514
00:35:40,727 --> 00:35:42,285
That's a shame.

515
00:35:42,407 --> 00:35:45,843
I shaved very closely in anticipation
of being smacked by you.

516
00:35:47,167 --> 00:35:49,806
That was very nicely played.

517
00:35:50,847 --> 00:35:52,041
Again.

518
00:35:52,927 --> 00:35:55,725
But there's still a presidential election
in six months.

519
00:35:55,807 --> 00:35:58,560
- I'll see you then.
- I have no doubt.

520
00:35:58,967 --> 00:36:01,197
Oh, one thing you should know.

521
00:36:03,527 --> 00:36:05,404
I didn't kill Valance.

522
00:36:07,247 --> 00:36:08,885
I wonder who did?

523
00:36:38,287 --> 00:36:40,926
Madam President, good evening.

524
00:36:42,847 --> 00:36:45,236
I thought you hated these things.

525
00:36:46,007 --> 00:36:49,522
It's Colonial Day.
Where else would I be? I'm a patriot.

526
00:36:51,007 --> 00:36:53,077
You really are, aren't you?

527
00:36:55,247 --> 00:36:58,796
Dr. Baltar. Interesting choice.

528
00:36:59,887 --> 00:37:03,562
I figured, the devil you know.

529
00:37:04,767 --> 00:37:08,043
Politics. As exciting as war.

530
00:37:08,367 --> 00:37:10,198
Definitely as dangerous.

531
00:37:10,567 --> 00:37:14,765
Though in war you only get killed once.

532
00:37:16,927 --> 00:37:20,840
In politics, it can happen over and over.

533
00:37:21,847 --> 00:37:23,678
You're still standing.

534
00:37:25,327 --> 00:37:26,885
So are you.

535
00:37:26,967 --> 00:37:28,559
And I can dance.

536
00:37:55,887 --> 00:37:59,800
- I have a surprise for you.
- Should I be worried?

537
00:38:03,207 --> 00:38:05,277
Not unless you consider a day...

538
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:10,202
<i>in a luxury suite aboard the Rising Star
as something to be worried about.</i>

539
00:38:10,567 --> 00:38:13,001
What? How did you swing that?

540
00:38:14,207 --> 00:38:15,845
I have my ways.

541
00:38:20,647 --> 00:38:22,683
What you need to do...

542
00:38:22,847 --> 00:38:26,760
is figure out a way to get slave-driving Bill
to give you the day off.

543
00:38:26,847 --> 00:38:28,565
Yeah.

544
00:38:29,127 --> 00:38:33,837
And while we're there, we might want
to talk to a few people...

545
00:38:34,367 --> 00:38:36,642
- about your future.
- What?

546
00:38:39,447 --> 00:38:42,439
Later, my love. It can all wait until later.

547
00:38:54,607 --> 00:38:56,120
Any second now.

548
00:38:59,127 --> 00:39:02,085
If we get caught... If anything happens...

549
00:39:02,607 --> 00:39:04,916
You don't have to say anything. I know.

550
00:39:05,287 --> 00:39:07,676
We're going to make it, Sharon. Okay?

551
00:39:17,847 --> 00:39:20,441
Okay. Go.

552
00:40:37,887 --> 00:40:39,240
Sharon?

553
00:40:40,207 --> 00:40:42,437
We're still alive. Why nobody else?

554
00:40:44,047 --> 00:40:45,480
You never get tired.

555
00:40:45,567 --> 00:40:46,966
Trust me.

556
00:40:47,047 --> 00:40:50,005
Helo, come with me. Helo.

557
00:40:53,007 --> 00:40:54,838
<i>Helo.</i>
