00:00:35,527 --> 00:00:37,518
Sharon, get out of here!

3
00:00:41,287 --> 00:00:43,243
Where are you? Sharon!

4
00:00:44,807 --> 00:00:46,399
Halt! No sudden moves.

5
00:00:46,487 --> 00:00:48,762
Get on your knees
and cross your ankles. Now!

6
00:00:48,847 --> 00:00:51,361
I'm human. I'm from Oasis.
It's a hamlet, public stop.

7
00:00:51,447 --> 00:00:52,436
I'm out of Havoca City.

8
00:00:52,527 --> 00:00:54,245
I'm not a Cylon!

9
00:00:54,327 --> 00:00:55,885
<i>Don't leave me!</i>

10
00:00:58,847 --> 00:01:01,805
<i>Attention, the Scorpia Traveller
has docked.</i>

11
00:01:01,887 --> 00:01:06,642
<i>Any civilians currently boarding Galactica
please proceed to security checkpoint.</i>

12
00:01:19,767 --> 00:01:20,995
Thank you.

15
00:01:35,287 --> 00:01:36,481
Next.

16
00:01:41,927 --> 00:01:43,280
Yes, okay.

17
00:01:53,327 --> 00:01:56,080
It's all clear?
I've got your back, Chief.

18
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:57,361
Thanks.

19
00:02:19,007 --> 00:02:21,123
- Anybody see you?
- No.

20
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:23,516
I went through the hatch combing
on C Causeway.

21
00:02:24,487 --> 00:02:25,920
Good girl.

22
00:02:29,687 --> 00:02:33,202
<i>Bravo team, EOD,

23
00:02:33,567 --> 00:02:35,125
<i>Hangar Bay 2.</i>

24
00:02:45,407 --> 00:02:47,716
You know, sometimes at work...

25
00:02:48,527 --> 00:02:51,485
I try to conjure up what your face looks like.

26
00:02:51,567 --> 00:02:53,478
The curve of your lips...

27
00:02:53,567 --> 00:02:56,286
the way your hair falls, how you smell.

28
00:02:57,447 --> 00:02:59,483
You see my face every day.

29
00:03:00,327 --> 00:03:02,443
Yeah, but not like this.

30
00:03:27,847 --> 00:03:30,441
Security, XO.
Send an armed detail to meet me...

31
00:03:30,527 --> 00:03:34,156
in the midpoint promenade deck causeway,
C level. Approach from the aft.

32
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,636
<i>Repeat. Approach from the aft.</i>

33
00:03:41,607 --> 00:03:42,801
Doral!

34
00:05:03,487 --> 00:05:05,125
What's the count?

35
00:05:05,207 --> 00:05:09,041
- Three dead. 13 injured.
- Did you get a good look at the bomber?

36
00:05:09,127 --> 00:05:11,197
- Yes.
- It was him, right?

37
00:05:12,527 --> 00:05:13,755
Yes.

38
00:05:13,927 --> 00:05:17,715
<i>I want to see the Master at Arms
in my office in ten minutes.</i>

39
00:05:17,807 --> 00:05:19,206
A Cylon?

40
00:05:19,727 --> 00:05:22,002
Eyewitness accounts state
the bomber was a man.

41
00:05:22,087 --> 00:05:24,237
The Cylons look like us now.

42
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:26,641
Like us?

43
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:31,361
Yes, they appear human.
The flesh, the blood...

44
00:05:32,567 --> 00:05:34,285
the whole thing.

45
00:05:35,527 --> 00:05:38,917
The bomber was another copy
of a man we knew as Doral...

46
00:05:39,007 --> 00:05:42,443
posing as the Public Relations Officer
aboard this ship.

47
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:46,679
They've learned that there are
multiple versions of the same Cylon.

48
00:05:47,287 --> 00:05:50,085
<i>I want you to open
an investigation immediately.</i>

49
00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:53,000
I want to find out how that Cylon
or any civilian...

50
00:05:53,087 --> 00:05:55,885
- could break through our security.
- There's been a string...

51
00:05:55,967 --> 00:05:58,117
of security incidents aboard ship, sir.

52
00:05:58,207 --> 00:06:01,802
The water tank explosion, the discovery
of explosives aboard a Raptor...

53
00:06:01,887 --> 00:06:03,764
- and now this.
- Your point?

54
00:06:06,047 --> 00:06:07,765
I need a free hand.

55
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:11,797
The authority to follow evidence
wherever it might lead...

56
00:06:11,887 --> 00:06:14,003
without command review.

57
00:06:14,087 --> 00:06:17,045
- Independent tribunal?
- Yes, sir.

58
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,119
You'll get it.

59
00:06:22,647 --> 00:06:25,684
Thank you.
That will be all, Sergeant.

60
00:06:26,567 --> 00:06:29,957
I also strongly recommend
alerting the public to the Cylon threat.

61
00:06:30,047 --> 00:06:32,800
<i>If there are other copies of this man
aboard the fleet...</i>

62
00:06:32,887 --> 00:06:35,845
we should find them
before they strike again.

63
00:06:37,367 --> 00:06:39,676
I'll take that under advisement.

64
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:42,435
That will be all.
Yes, sir.

65
00:06:44,527 --> 00:06:47,997
Open to the public. There's a can of worms.

66
00:06:49,287 --> 00:06:52,165
Keeping silent hasn't helped us very much.

67
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:57,286
Maybe shining a light on the situation
will make things pop up.

68
00:06:57,367 --> 00:06:58,880
All right.

69
00:07:00,327 --> 00:07:01,442
Hey.

70
00:07:04,407 --> 00:07:05,920
I owe you one.

71
00:07:10,047 --> 00:07:13,005
- Sir.
- Colonel.

72
00:07:17,887 --> 00:07:19,206
Get me the President.

73
00:07:19,287 --> 00:07:22,438
Don't kink the line.
There, we've got it.

74
00:07:22,527 --> 00:07:24,245
Okay, let's go.

75
00:07:32,247 --> 00:07:33,805
So who's first?

76
00:07:35,407 --> 00:07:36,840
How about me?

77
00:07:36,927 --> 00:07:39,202
- Hey, Chief.
- How's it going there, on top?

78
00:07:39,287 --> 00:07:43,405
- Hi.
- Come on. Let's have it. Come on.

79
00:07:51,767 --> 00:07:53,803
You people are
the sorriest of the sorry.

80
00:07:53,887 --> 00:07:55,639
The dumbest of the dumb.

81
00:07:55,727 --> 00:07:57,683
The only thing
you're making out of this...

82
00:07:57,767 --> 00:08:00,156
is a one-way trip to sick bay or the morgue.

83
00:08:02,167 --> 00:08:05,159
Now, tonight, after night call...

84
00:08:05,247 --> 00:08:08,125
one of you brings me
twice this length of copper tubing...

85
00:08:08,207 --> 00:08:10,482
a spot heater and a CO2 scrubber.

86
00:08:10,567 --> 00:08:12,797
I'll show you people how this is done.

87
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,561
All right?

88
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:18,359
Now get the hell out of here
before I change my mind.

89
00:08:18,727 --> 00:08:20,046
Thank you.

90
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,676
Children.

91
00:08:33,807 --> 00:08:37,163
He's very handsome.
You really think so?

92
00:08:37,247 --> 00:08:40,398
She says that about everyone.
You disagree?

93
00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:43,805
He's attractive.

94
00:08:44,407 --> 00:08:47,160
I hope you're more convincing
than that with him.

95
00:08:53,687 --> 00:08:57,600
If he wants to find me, he'll head north,
toward Cylon forces he's already seen.

96
00:08:57,687 --> 00:09:02,283
If he wants to go alone, he'll go south,
hoping to find another way off the planet.

97
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:05,086
Either way,
he won't make his move until nightfall.

98
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:07,886
If he flees, he dies.

99
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:11,798
<i>There's going to be a huge reaction.</i>

100
00:09:11,887 --> 00:09:13,240
If there are any other Cylons...

101
00:09:13,327 --> 00:09:16,000
aboard any of our ships,
we need to find them.

102
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:19,879
If we enlist the help of the public,
it'll make it a lot easier.

103
00:09:19,967 --> 00:09:23,516
People are going to be shocked, angry,
terrified, paranoid.

104
00:09:23,607 --> 00:09:27,043
<i>There is a price to be paid
when asking for the public's help.</i>

105
00:09:27,127 --> 00:09:30,722
<i>They're going to demand, at the very least,
that someone be held accountable.</i>

106
00:09:30,807 --> 00:09:32,206
I'm setting up a tribunal.

107
00:09:32,287 --> 00:09:35,085
That tribunal will have to come back
to the public with a name.

108
00:09:35,167 --> 00:09:36,236
<i>Someone who screwed up.</i>

109
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:38,636
We don't know if anybody screwed up.

110
00:09:39,367 --> 00:09:43,758
A Cylon agent penetrated your security,
killing three people.

111
00:09:44,287 --> 00:09:47,199
<i>At least one of your men
or women screwed up.</i>

112
00:09:47,967 --> 00:09:49,798
Look, here's my view:

113
00:09:50,407 --> 00:09:54,605
Independent tribunal, openness,
transparency, it all sounds great.

114
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:58,475
<i>But after 20 years in political office,
I'm telling you these things have a way...</i>

115
00:09:58,567 --> 00:10:01,035
<i>of inflicting damage on the people
you least expect.</i>

116
00:10:01,127 --> 00:10:04,403
I do not want a witch hunt on our hands.

117
00:10:06,367 --> 00:10:09,359
So, where were you
at the time of the bombing?

118
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:13,637
In my rack, reading some trashy novel
Socinus gave me.

119
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:17,800
- Did you see the Chief?
- Chief?

120
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:21,757
He was on the Hangar Deck
going over some paperwork, I think.

121
00:10:21,847 --> 00:10:24,441
How do you know that
if you were in your rack?

122
00:10:26,327 --> 00:10:28,841
I saw him right before I turned in.

123
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:32,523
I was with Cally playing Pyramid
in the mess hall corridor.

124
00:10:32,607 --> 00:10:35,280
You sure?
Yeah. She's pretty good.

125
00:10:37,327 --> 00:10:40,319
- Did you see the Chief?
- Yeah, he was there.

126
00:10:40,647 --> 00:10:44,720
I mean, not the whole time.
He dropped in, watched us play for a while.

127
00:10:45,727 --> 00:10:46,842
Okay.

128
00:10:49,887 --> 00:10:52,560
I was on watch.
Did you see the Chief?

129
00:10:52,887 --> 00:10:54,639
The Chief? No.

130
00:10:54,967 --> 00:10:58,198
- He wasn't on the Hangar Deck?
- No.

131
00:10:58,927 --> 00:11:00,804
Wait. Yeah. Yeah, he was.

132
00:11:00,887 --> 00:11:04,675
He came in, did some work
on one of the Vipers that the Captain rides.

133
00:11:04,967 --> 00:11:06,286
Thank you.

134
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,840
- Asleep in my rack.
- Sure about that?

135
00:11:18,247 --> 00:11:19,646
Positive.

136
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:24,927
I was asleep, Sergeant.

137
00:11:25,007 --> 00:11:27,965
All right. That'll be all for now.

138
00:11:49,687 --> 00:11:53,316
Good afternoon and thank you for coming.
Please be seated.

139
00:11:55,847 --> 00:11:58,680
I'm sure by now, word of the explosion...

140
00:11:58,767 --> 00:12:01,839
<i>on the Galactica
has spread to the entire fleet.</i>

141
00:12:02,287 --> 00:12:06,565
<i>We offer our continued gratitude
to the brave men and women...</i>

142
00:12:07,047 --> 00:12:09,003
aboard this mighty ship.

143
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,760
<i>In consultation with Commander Adama...</i>

144
00:12:12,087 --> 00:12:15,079
<i>I have appointed an independent tribunal...</i>

145
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:19,080
<i>to investigate the circumstances
surrounding this explosion.</i>

146
00:12:19,487 --> 00:12:23,241
<i>Also, in the interest of security
and public safety...</i>

147
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:27,718
<i>I feel it is time to reveal certain information
that has until now...</i>

148
00:12:27,887 --> 00:12:29,957
<i>remained a tightly-guarded secret.</i>

149
00:12:30,047 --> 00:12:34,802
<i>This information was known only to myself,
Commander Adama...</i>

150
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:38,996
<i>- and a few select advisors.
- The cat's out of the bag.</i>

151
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:45,206
The Cylons have the ability to mimic
human form. They look like us now.

152
00:12:47,207 --> 00:12:50,961
<i>We have reason to believe
that a Cylon agent was responsible...</i>

153
00:12:51,047 --> 00:12:53,561
<i>for the explosions aboard Galactica.</i>

154
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:57,244
<i>This man has been identified
as a Cylon agent.</i>

155
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:00,321
<i>We believe him to be responsible
for the bombing.</i>

156
00:13:00,407 --> 00:13:04,480
<i>He evidently slipped aboard the Galactica
with a civilian group...</i>

157
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:09,285
killed a Marine guard,
stole the explosives and detonated them...

158
00:13:10,007 --> 00:13:13,602
killing three members of the crew
and destroying himself.

159
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:17,364
This man has also been identified
as a Cylon.

160
00:13:17,647 --> 00:13:21,720
And we now know that
there are duplicates of each Cylon model.

161
00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:28,277
Anyone seeing either of these two men
at anytime, anywhere in the fleet...

162
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:31,440
<i>should immediately contact
the Battlestar Galactica...</i>

163
00:13:31,527 --> 00:13:33,882
and the office of the President.

164
00:13:37,367 --> 00:13:39,039
Now I'll take your questions.

165
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:45,485
They've known about this the whole time
and they tell us now?

166
00:13:45,567 --> 00:13:47,842
Cylon?

167
00:13:49,087 --> 00:13:51,840
- I mean, who's the Cylon now?
- This is too much.

168
00:13:51,927 --> 00:13:53,838
I don't even want to know this.

169
00:13:53,927 --> 00:13:56,077
Excuse me, sir.
Will you come with us, please?

170
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:58,522
What? Why?
What's going on, Sergeant?

171
00:13:58,607 --> 00:14:00,563
Chief, we need you
to come along as well.

172
00:14:00,647 --> 00:14:01,682
You're arresting the Chief?

173
00:14:01,767 --> 00:14:02,802
Who's arresting him?

174
00:14:02,887 --> 00:14:04,764
- No one is under arrest.
- What's all this?

175
00:14:04,847 --> 00:14:06,326
Step back.

176
00:14:06,927 --> 00:14:09,839
Lieutenant asked you a question, Sergeant.

177
00:14:10,527 --> 00:14:12,085
A Tribunal has been convened...

178
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:14,476
to look into the Cylon penetration
of our defences.

179
00:14:14,567 --> 00:14:17,365
<i>It requires the presence
of Lt. Valerii and Chief Tyrol.</i>

180
00:14:17,447 --> 00:14:20,644
I am here to escort them
to the Wardroom. Sir.

181
00:14:26,727 --> 00:14:28,126
Very well.

182
00:14:28,407 --> 00:14:30,682
Proceed.
Thank you, sir.

183
00:14:32,407 --> 00:14:35,524
Lieutenant, Chief,
you'll come with me, please.

184
00:14:35,927 --> 00:14:38,361
You're it till I get back. Don't worry.

185
00:14:40,327 --> 00:14:43,603
Lt. Valerii, where were you
at the time of the explosion?

186
00:14:44,647 --> 00:14:47,036
I was in my rack. Asleep.

187
00:14:49,247 --> 00:14:51,238
Did anyone see you, sir?

188
00:14:52,847 --> 00:14:55,361
I don't know. I was asleep.

189
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:00,086
Lieutenant...

190
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:05,636
is it true that you and the Chief are involved
in a romantic and physical relationship...

191
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:09,037
in violation of
the Colonial Code of Military Conduct?

192
00:15:09,207 --> 00:15:12,040
- I thought this was about...
- Just answer the question, please.

193
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:15,324
Are you and the Chief
involved in a relationship?

194
00:15:16,007 --> 00:15:17,156
No.

195
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:20,404
The XO ordered us to put a stop to it.
And so we did.

196
00:15:29,607 --> 00:15:31,882
Sir, can you testify
as to the whereabouts...

197
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:35,482
of Chief Petty Officer Tyrol
at the time of the bombing?

198
00:15:37,407 --> 00:15:39,557
I have no idea where he was.

199
00:15:40,767 --> 00:15:43,520
- Thank you, sir.
- You're excused, Lieutenant.

200
00:15:43,607 --> 00:15:46,167
But I am sure he had nothing to do
with the bombing...

201
00:15:46,247 --> 00:15:48,477
You are excused, Lieutenant.

202
00:15:48,887 --> 00:15:51,321
Bring in the next witness, please.

203
00:15:53,527 --> 00:15:56,439
The testimony you give before
this tribunal may be used...

204
00:15:56,527 --> 00:16:00,759
to adjudicate your guilt or innocence
in the matter under investigation.

205
00:16:00,847 --> 00:16:02,883
<i>Do you understand?</i>

206
00:16:04,887 --> 00:16:06,002
Yes.

207
00:16:07,087 --> 00:16:09,601
The matter being investigated
is first...

208
00:16:09,687 --> 00:16:13,760
<i>how a Cylon,
penetrated Galactica's security system...</i>

209
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:17,085
<i>and second,
whether one of Galactica's crew members...</i>

210
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:19,601
aided and abetted this crime through...

211
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:22,645
conspiracy and collusion with the Cylons.

212
00:16:22,727 --> 00:16:24,080
Collusion with the Cylons?

213
00:16:24,167 --> 00:16:27,284
Do you consent to give
your testimony freely without invoking...

214
00:16:27,367 --> 00:16:31,758
your right to remain silent as provided for
under the 23rd Article of Colonization?

215
00:16:35,047 --> 00:16:37,800
- I do.
- Then let's begin.

216
00:16:42,047 --> 00:16:45,676
They're going after the Chief.
They're going after the Cylons.

217
00:16:45,767 --> 00:16:47,519
- What the hell does that mean?
- Wake up.

218
00:16:47,647 --> 00:16:49,603
The world's changed while you were asleep.

219
00:16:49,687 --> 00:16:50,722
Frak you.

220
00:16:50,807 --> 00:16:54,402
Cylons look like people.
That means anyone. Anyone.

221
00:16:54,487 --> 00:16:56,159
- Not the Chief.
- How do you know?

222
00:16:56,247 --> 00:16:57,726
- I know.
- This is stupid.

223
00:16:57,807 --> 00:16:59,684
You two just don't want to deal with reality.

224
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:01,962
You want to keep your heads
buried in the sand.

225
00:17:02,047 --> 00:17:04,925
That's exactly what the Cylons want.
For us to turn on each other.

226
00:17:05,007 --> 00:17:08,204
Start getting suspicious, paranoid.
She's right.

227
00:17:08,287 --> 00:17:12,246
If we don't believe in each other
when the heat comes down, we're nothing.

228
00:17:12,327 --> 00:17:15,717
That kind of thinking is over.
It's every man for himself now.

229
00:17:19,367 --> 00:17:21,597
You better watch your backs.

230
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:28,840
You had the mid-watch
before the bombing, correct?

231
00:17:28,927 --> 00:17:30,042
Yes.

232
00:17:30,127 --> 00:17:33,085
Would you please explain to the tribunal
what you do on watch?

233
00:17:33,167 --> 00:17:35,727
I walk the perimeter
of the Hangar Deck...

234
00:17:35,807 --> 00:17:37,923
the tool rooms, storage facilities.

235
00:17:38,007 --> 00:17:40,123
To make sure all hatches are sealed?

236
00:17:40,207 --> 00:17:41,242
Yes.

237
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:45,081
That no unauthorised personnel
is poking around where they shouldn't?

238
00:17:45,167 --> 00:17:48,762
That's right. And there was no one
on the Hangar Deck that night.

239
00:17:50,647 --> 00:17:53,400
I believe that's what your log says.

240
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:02,719
What about the hatch combing
for Causeway C?

241
00:18:04,247 --> 00:18:06,317
- Anybody see you?
- No.

242
00:18:06,407 --> 00:18:08,637
I went through the hatch combing
on C Causeway.

243
00:18:08,727 --> 00:18:12,481
Your log indicates that all hatches
and portals were locked and sealed.

244
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:15,206
If that's what the log indicates,
then that's the case.

245
00:18:15,287 --> 00:18:17,517
Which would include
the hatch combing for Causeway C?

246
00:18:17,607 --> 00:18:19,837
I don't know where the Sergeant
is going with this.

247
00:18:19,927 --> 00:18:22,760
But they're not related.
What if I told you that...

248
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,917
I found the hatch open after the bombing?

249
00:18:25,007 --> 00:18:27,123
I would say that
I don't know how that's possible.

250
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:29,038
It's not just any hatch on the Hangar Deck.

251
00:18:29,127 --> 00:18:32,278
It opens onto a causeway which leads
directly to a small arms locker...

252
00:18:32,367 --> 00:18:34,403
where a Marine guard was found dead
at the scene.

253
00:18:34,487 --> 00:18:37,320
<i>The locker was opened
with the correct code.</i>

254
00:18:38,247 --> 00:18:41,364
Do you have the correct code
to that locker, Chief?

255
00:18:43,127 --> 00:18:46,563
Yes, I do, as do dozens of others,
including the guard.

256
00:18:46,647 --> 00:18:50,003
<i>It's possible the Cylon forced the guard
to open it before he killed him.</i>

257
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:53,875
I want to take this opportunity to state that,
that was an internal security matter.

258
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:56,686
<i>And this falls under the purview
of the Master at Arms.</i>

259
00:18:56,767 --> 00:18:59,964
And the Master at Arms is Sergeant Hadrian.

260
00:19:00,687 --> 00:19:03,804
Did Lt. Valerii leave
the hatch combing open last night?

261
00:19:05,447 --> 00:19:09,076
I have no idea
who left the hatch combing open last night.

262
00:19:13,407 --> 00:19:17,400
Chief, were you doing paperwork
at the time of the bombing?

263
00:19:17,487 --> 00:19:19,876
- No.
- Were you working on a Viper at that time?

264
00:19:19,967 --> 00:19:21,161
No.

265
00:19:21,247 --> 00:19:24,080
Were you watching a pick-up game
of Pyramid in the mess hall...

266
00:19:24,167 --> 00:19:25,156
at the time of the bombing?

267
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:28,603
No! As I told you earlier today,
I was asleep in my rack.

268
00:19:28,687 --> 00:19:30,996
Then why do I have
three different statements...

269
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,725
from three of your deckhands...

270
00:19:32,807 --> 00:19:37,039
stating variously that they all saw you
and you were anywhere but in your rack?

271
00:19:37,687 --> 00:19:41,521
<i>Chief Tyrol, where were you
at the time of the bombing?</i>

272
00:19:44,047 --> 00:19:46,880
Were you, in fact,
meeting with a Cylon agent?

273
00:19:51,367 --> 00:19:54,359
I exercise my right under Article 23.

274
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:03,802
By invoking the 23rd Article at this time,
the tribunal will look on this...

275
00:20:03,887 --> 00:20:07,516
as further evidence of your guilt.
So I will ask you one last time.

276
00:20:08,247 --> 00:20:10,477
Who were you with
at the time of the bombing...

277
00:20:10,567 --> 00:20:13,081
and was this person a Cylon agent?

278
00:20:21,247 --> 00:20:24,205
Your sworn statement
indicates that you were on watch...

279
00:20:24,287 --> 00:20:26,721
at the time of the bombing
and that you saw Chief Tyrol...

280
00:20:26,807 --> 00:20:30,038
- work on one of the Vipers. Is that true?
- Yes, sir.

281
00:20:30,127 --> 00:20:34,405
Specialist, can you explain to us
why Chief Tyrol told us in his testimony...

282
00:20:34,487 --> 00:20:37,877
that he was in his rack asleep
at the time of the bombing?

283
00:20:39,887 --> 00:20:42,640
Speak up, Specialist.
He said that?

284
00:20:43,087 --> 00:20:45,362
Did you see him or didn't you?

285
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:51,764
Specialist!
No, I did not, sir.

286
00:20:52,447 --> 00:20:56,076
So the Chief did not come
to the Hangar Deck after all?

287
00:20:57,167 --> 00:20:58,725
I don't know.

288
00:20:59,367 --> 00:21:01,005
I left my post.

289
00:21:01,967 --> 00:21:03,320
Excuse me?

290
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:06,004
I left my post, sir.

291
00:21:06,407 --> 00:21:08,637
<i>I ducked out to get a smoke.</i>

292
00:21:09,327 --> 00:21:12,683
I went to the galley to get some chow.
The Chief...

293
00:21:13,007 --> 00:21:15,567
I mean, I don't know where he was.

294
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:18,480
<i>I'm sure he was asleep in his rack
just like he said.</i>

295
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:20,523
You went to the galley?

296
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:22,116
Yes, sir.

297
00:21:22,207 --> 00:21:24,960
Did you go through
the hatch combing on C Deck?

298
00:21:25,047 --> 00:21:28,164
Well, to get to the galley,
that would be the best way.

299
00:21:28,247 --> 00:21:30,442
Yes, sir, I went through that hatch.

300
00:21:30,527 --> 00:21:33,837
- Did you leave it open?
- I'm not sure.

301
00:21:38,527 --> 00:21:40,483
Yes, sir. I think I did.

302
00:21:42,127 --> 00:21:44,038
The Chief had nothing to do with it.

303
00:21:44,127 --> 00:21:47,039
It was me.
I left my post and I left the hatch open.

304
00:21:49,887 --> 00:21:52,117
It was me. Just me.

305
00:21:53,927 --> 00:21:57,363
You realise, that by leaving the hatch open,
you allowed a Cylon...

306
00:21:57,447 --> 00:22:00,200
to gain access to the small arms locker?

307
00:22:01,767 --> 00:22:02,916
Yes, sir.

308
00:22:03,007 --> 00:22:07,159
Specialist, did Chief Tyrol instruct you
to leave the hatch open deliberately...

309
00:22:07,247 --> 00:22:11,718
as part of a conspiracy to allow the Cylon
to gain access to the small arms locker?

310
00:22:11,807 --> 00:22:14,367
The Chief is innocent. He didn't do anything.

311
00:22:14,447 --> 00:22:17,917
Specialist, did you leave
the hatch open deliberately?

312
00:22:24,567 --> 00:22:25,841
Yes, sir.

313
00:22:27,407 --> 00:22:30,763
Whatever happened, it was me. Just me.

314
00:22:52,647 --> 00:22:53,841
South.

315
00:22:54,687 --> 00:22:58,362
You overestimated his willingness
to risk himself for you.

316
00:22:58,487 --> 00:23:00,557
He just doesn't love you.

317
00:23:14,327 --> 00:23:15,476
Wait.

318
00:23:32,487 --> 00:23:35,206
North. Toward his love.

319
00:23:36,127 --> 00:23:38,595
Seems you made an impression after all.

320
00:23:38,687 --> 00:23:41,963
He's a good man.
He always does the right thing.

321
00:23:44,767 --> 00:23:47,327
Are you prepared for the next step?

322
00:23:48,247 --> 00:23:49,362
Yes.

323
00:23:51,247 --> 00:23:53,477
- Hello, Lieutenant.
- Doctor.

324
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:58,679
I brought you a cigar. A recovery gift.

325
00:23:59,407 --> 00:24:01,967
- How are you?
- I'm good.

326
00:24:02,807 --> 00:24:06,436
The food is good, company is better.

327
00:24:06,527 --> 00:24:09,678
Yes, I just happened to be
absolutely nowhere near sick bay.

328
00:24:09,767 --> 00:24:11,644
I thought I would...

329
00:24:13,247 --> 00:24:15,920
- see how you were doing.
- So, Doctor...

330
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:19,000
your super secret project's on C Deck, right?

331
00:24:19,087 --> 00:24:22,045
I'm not at liberty to divulge exactly
what I am doing on C Deck.

332
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,595
But you're more than welcome to pop by.

333
00:24:24,687 --> 00:24:26,518
Once you're ambulatory.

334
00:24:26,647 --> 00:24:30,242
- The bomber was on C Deck, right?
- Yes, I know. I heard the explosion.

335
00:24:30,327 --> 00:24:34,081
- Very frightening.
- Do you think that's where he was headed?

336
00:24:38,087 --> 00:24:41,363
- I'm sorry. I didn't follow you.
- The Cylon bomber?

337
00:24:41,727 --> 00:24:45,037
Do you think that he was trying
to blow up your project?

338
00:24:45,127 --> 00:24:46,924
And you along with it?

339
00:24:47,007 --> 00:24:48,565
It's funny.

340
00:24:49,767 --> 00:24:51,280
I hadn't thought of that.

341
00:24:53,327 --> 00:24:55,966
Kind of hits you where you live, huh?

342
00:24:56,247 --> 00:24:58,158
Yes, it does, actually.

343
00:25:00,607 --> 00:25:02,359
You get well soon.

344
00:25:09,687 --> 00:25:11,325
They're trying to kill me.

345
00:25:11,407 --> 00:25:14,797
Me, always me.
They're trying to destroy your work.

346
00:25:14,887 --> 00:25:17,196
Destroying you is an added bonus.
But why?

347
00:25:17,287 --> 00:25:20,120
I don't understand.
Why are they trying to blow me up?

348
00:25:20,207 --> 00:25:21,765
You told me what to do.

349
00:25:21,847 --> 00:25:24,884
I wouldn't be making
this Cylon detector if it wasn't for you.

350
00:25:24,967 --> 00:25:27,117
But I'm just in your head, Gaius.

351
00:25:27,207 --> 00:25:30,961
They don't know about me or us
or our life together.

352
00:25:31,047 --> 00:25:32,275
How romantic.

353
00:25:32,367 --> 00:25:35,165
I'm going to have to destroy
that Cylon detector myself.

354
00:25:35,247 --> 00:25:37,966
Blame the sabotage on Cylon agents.
That's what I'll tell Adama.

355
00:25:40,167 --> 00:25:42,203
No, you won't.

356
00:25:42,287 --> 00:25:45,802
You're gonna complete the project
just like I told you.

357
00:25:46,167 --> 00:25:48,237
Really? Would I?

358
00:25:49,807 --> 00:25:51,081
Or what?

359
00:25:52,007 --> 00:25:54,362
Don't make me angry, Gaius.

360
00:25:56,247 --> 00:25:58,761
You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.

361
00:26:21,727 --> 00:26:22,955
Sharon.

362
00:26:30,687 --> 00:26:32,279
Is that enough?

363
00:26:36,767 --> 00:26:40,282
No, Sharon wouldn't give up
without a much earned fight.

364
00:27:13,287 --> 00:27:16,359
<i>Did you read the tribunal report?
Yes.</i>

365
00:27:17,247 --> 00:27:21,559
<i>And I'm sorry to read that one of your men
has been charged with conspiracy...</i>

366
00:27:21,647 --> 00:27:25,845
- and collusion with a Cylon agent.
- Specialist Socinus.

367
00:27:26,327 --> 00:27:29,000
<i>But after reading the transcripts
I have my doubts.</i>

368
00:27:29,087 --> 00:27:33,160
What about this other man,
your Chief Tyrol, he took the 23rd?

369
00:27:33,247 --> 00:27:36,603
- What is that about, do you think?
- It's his right.

370
00:27:37,727 --> 00:27:40,924
The courts have never held
that invoking the right to remain silent...

371
00:27:41,007 --> 00:27:42,884
can be used as evidence of guilt.

372
00:27:42,967 --> 00:27:44,958
You sound like a lawyer.

373
00:27:46,047 --> 00:27:48,925
My father was a lawyer. Civil liberties.

374
00:27:51,007 --> 00:27:53,965
Let's set aside the legalities for a moment.

375
00:27:54,887 --> 00:27:57,606
Obviously, you are defending your man.

376
00:27:57,687 --> 00:28:00,599
I respect that, I do.
But he is hiding something.

377
00:28:00,687 --> 00:28:04,282
Chief Tyrol has been under my command
for over five years.

378
00:28:04,367 --> 00:28:07,837
And if he had really wanted
to take this ship down...

379
00:28:08,847 --> 00:28:11,645
he could. This is over.

380
00:28:18,407 --> 00:28:21,922
Madam President,
I'm gonna have to call you right back.

381
00:28:24,487 --> 00:28:25,715
What?

382
00:28:26,607 --> 00:28:29,963
I have orders to bring you
before the tribunal, sir.

383
00:28:40,007 --> 00:28:41,486
Let's go.

384
00:30:50,007 --> 00:30:51,235
It's okay.

385
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:57,720
Helo.

386
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:01,319
What's happening?

387
00:31:05,207 --> 00:31:08,119
Can you walk?
I think so.

388
00:31:08,927 --> 00:31:11,725
Come on. I got you. Okay.

389
00:31:14,127 --> 00:31:15,958
Now we're even.

390
00:31:21,927 --> 00:31:24,964
- I think we should go.
- Right. Okay.

391
00:31:29,207 --> 00:31:30,686
Come on.

392
00:31:33,727 --> 00:31:36,924
It's going to be all right.
You're going to be just fine.

393
00:31:43,367 --> 00:31:47,645
Commander Adama, when did you
first learn the truth about the Cylons?

394
00:31:48,007 --> 00:31:50,601
On Ragnar station. Before we left.

395
00:31:50,687 --> 00:31:54,043
And you chose to withhold
this crucial information, sir?

396
00:31:54,127 --> 00:31:55,480
Yes.
Why?

397
00:31:56,487 --> 00:31:57,761
I felt that...

398
00:31:57,847 --> 00:32:00,805
to alarm the public,
would only cause chaos and panic.

399
00:32:00,887 --> 00:32:02,081
But...

400
00:32:03,487 --> 00:32:05,284
you also withheld the information...

401
00:32:05,367 --> 00:32:08,359
from your own security detachment
aboard ship, sir.

402
00:32:09,007 --> 00:32:12,204
Not knowing who to trust,
I decided to keep the information...

403
00:32:12,287 --> 00:32:14,517
compartmentalised for the time being.

404
00:32:14,607 --> 00:32:18,395
Sir, isn't it true that had we known that
the Cylons appeared human...

405
00:32:18,487 --> 00:32:21,877
different security procedures
would have been followed?

406
00:32:21,967 --> 00:32:23,286
Probably.

407
00:32:23,887 --> 00:32:27,038
But I had to weigh
the possible ramifications of both.

408
00:32:27,367 --> 00:32:31,519
Isn't it also true, sir, that
had different procedures been followed...

409
00:32:31,607 --> 00:32:34,440
- the bombing may have been prevented?
- That's speculative.

410
00:32:34,527 --> 00:32:37,837
- I'm asking if it's possible.
- I know what you're asking, Sergeant.

411
00:32:37,927 --> 00:32:40,999
I will not speculate as to
what might have happened.

412
00:32:41,087 --> 00:32:43,601
Do you personally believe that...

413
00:32:43,687 --> 00:32:47,123
a Cylon agent planted explosives
in the ship's water tank?

414
00:32:47,207 --> 00:32:48,276
Yes.

415
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:52,758
Do you believe that there are Cylon agents
aboard ship even as we speak?

416
00:32:57,847 --> 00:32:59,166
Yes, I do.

417
00:33:04,007 --> 00:33:06,965
Sir, isn't it true that you knew...

418
00:33:07,447 --> 00:33:12,237
that Lt. Valerii and Chief Tyrol
were having an illicit relationship...

419
00:33:12,847 --> 00:33:15,077
in violation of regulations?

420
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:18,284
I don't see the relevance
of this line of questioning, Sergeant.

421
00:33:18,367 --> 00:33:20,085
The commander should bear in mind...

422
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:23,125
that my questions are not subject
to the Commander's review.

423
00:33:23,207 --> 00:33:25,357
Why did you allow the relationship
to continue...

424
00:33:25,447 --> 00:33:28,007
knowing it was against regulations?

425
00:33:28,647 --> 00:33:30,285
I'm a soft touch.

426
00:33:34,447 --> 00:33:37,723
Sir, are you aware that
both Lt. Valerii and Chief Tyrol...

427
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:41,482
have been implicated as possibly being
in collusion with the Cylons?

428
00:33:42,447 --> 00:33:45,280
I'm aware of the allegations.
Where are you going with this?

429
00:33:45,367 --> 00:33:47,085
I will ask the questions, sir.

430
00:33:47,167 --> 00:33:50,204
Isn't it true that by allowing
their relationship to continue...

431
00:33:50,287 --> 00:33:51,925
in violation of regulations...

432
00:33:52,007 --> 00:33:54,840
you may have made it possible
for two Cylon collaborators...

433
00:33:54,927 --> 00:33:58,317
to compromise the safety and security
of this ship?

434
00:34:01,367 --> 00:34:02,516
We're done here.

435
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:04,916
Excuse me, sir,
but my questions are not finished.

436
00:34:05,007 --> 00:34:07,077
You've lost your way, Sergeant.

437
00:34:07,167 --> 00:34:09,317
You've lost sight of the purpose of the law...

438
00:34:09,407 --> 00:34:12,683
to protect its citizens, not persecute them.

439
00:34:13,727 --> 00:34:17,242
Whatever we are, whatever is left of us.

440
00:34:17,887 --> 00:34:19,843
We're better than that.

441
00:34:19,927 --> 00:34:21,918
Now these proceedings are closed.

442
00:34:22,047 --> 00:34:26,325
You'll be transported back to your ships,
and we appreciate your help.

443
00:34:26,887 --> 00:34:28,206
Commander.

444
00:34:31,767 --> 00:34:35,885
This is an independent board.
You have no authority to close our inquiry.

445
00:34:40,847 --> 00:34:42,678
This is a witch hunt.

446
00:34:44,247 --> 00:34:46,715
I will not have it aboard my ship.

447
00:34:51,007 --> 00:34:52,235
Corporal of the guard!

448
00:34:52,327 --> 00:34:55,399
Restrain the Commander
and return him back to the witness chair.

449
00:34:58,647 --> 00:35:02,765
Your orders are to escort
Sergeant Hadrian back to her quarters...

450
00:35:02,927 --> 00:35:06,158
and keep her in confinement
until further notice.

451
00:35:09,687 --> 00:35:11,518
Make your choice, son.

452
00:35:17,167 --> 00:35:21,285
Sergeant Hadrian,
you'll come with us, please.

453
00:35:29,247 --> 00:35:31,363
She's just about to speak.

454
00:35:32,327 --> 00:35:35,478
Yes, I tried to get an interview
with her myself.

455
00:35:36,287 --> 00:35:38,323
Good evening, have a seat.

456
00:35:40,207 --> 00:35:43,517
<i>The investigation into the suicide bombing
aboard Galactica...</i>

457
00:35:43,607 --> 00:35:46,519
and how it was allowed to occur
has come to a close.

458
00:35:46,647 --> 00:35:49,923
<i>You are all aware that the bomber
was a Cylon agent.</i>

459
00:35:50,007 --> 00:35:52,237
<i>The tribunal has determined...</i>

460
00:35:52,327 --> 00:35:54,966
<i>that the Cylon gained access
to the explosives...</i>

461
00:35:55,047 --> 00:35:58,244
<i>by going through a hatch door
in the Hangar Deck of the ship.</i>

462
00:35:58,327 --> 00:36:00,921
<i>This door was left open due to negligence...</i>

463
00:36:01,007 --> 00:36:02,963
<i>of one of the ship's crewmen.</i>

464
00:36:03,047 --> 00:36:05,481
<i>His name is Specialist Socinus.</i>

465
00:36:05,567 --> 00:36:09,401
<i>He has confessed to lying under oath
and dereliction of duty in a time of war.</i>

466
00:36:09,807 --> 00:36:13,402
He has been stripped of his rank
and confined to the Brig.

467
00:36:13,647 --> 00:36:15,603
At this point, we have no reason to believe...

468
00:36:15,687 --> 00:36:17,917
<i>that there were
any other parties responsible.</i>

469
00:36:18,007 --> 00:36:19,599
<i>Now I'll take your questions. You, sir.</i>

470
00:36:23,167 --> 00:36:25,476
Commander, permission to enter?

471
00:36:26,327 --> 00:36:28,841
What is it, Chief?
Thank you, sir.

472
00:36:29,567 --> 00:36:31,956
Sir, I believe that Socinus...

473
00:36:32,207 --> 00:36:36,598
I believe that his confession was a lie.
I think that he's covering for me.

474
00:36:36,687 --> 00:36:38,086
For you?

475
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:43,003
I think that he's doing this
out of a sense of misplaced loyalty to me.

476
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:48,559
Somewhere in this there's truth.
Care to take me to it?

477
00:36:53,047 --> 00:36:56,562
Sir, I was with Lt. Valerii
at the time of the bombing.

478
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:59,684
<i>The Deck gang, they all knew it.
They've known all along.</i>

479
00:36:59,767 --> 00:37:03,043
They're trying to cover for me.
They started lying. Socinus...

480
00:37:03,127 --> 00:37:07,678
I think that he thinks he's helping
protect me by taking a fall like this.

481
00:37:08,167 --> 00:37:11,443
You don't really know
if he was on duty or not, do you?

482
00:37:11,527 --> 00:37:15,236
Commander, he's innocent.
I know that much. I should be in the Brig.

483
00:37:15,327 --> 00:37:18,364
Well, that's a fact.
You should be in the Brig.

484
00:37:18,447 --> 00:37:20,358
Commander, this isn't right.

485
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:23,245
- You can't let an innocent kid...
- I can't?

486
00:37:26,847 --> 00:37:28,678
What I can't do...

487
00:37:28,767 --> 00:37:31,565
is I can't let someone
that wears this uniform...

488
00:37:31,647 --> 00:37:34,525
get on the witness stand and lie under oath.

489
00:37:34,607 --> 00:37:36,563
And that's what your man did.

490
00:37:36,647 --> 00:37:39,764
He either lied the first time
or he lied the second time.

491
00:37:39,847 --> 00:37:42,042
And it doesn't matter.

492
00:37:42,127 --> 00:37:44,641
He's guilty and he'll pay the price.

493
00:37:45,007 --> 00:37:48,124
You? You'll pay a different price.

494
00:37:48,447 --> 00:37:51,757
<i>You'll have to walk out
on that Hangar Deck every day...</i>

495
00:37:51,847 --> 00:37:54,520
knowing that one of your men
is in the Brig...

496
00:37:54,607 --> 00:37:57,201
because you couldn't keep your fly zipped.

497
00:37:59,087 --> 00:38:03,444
<i>You're the most experienced,
noncommissioned officer we have left.</i>

498
00:38:04,327 --> 00:38:06,477
You keep my planes flying.

499
00:38:08,207 --> 00:38:10,402
I need my planes to fly.

500
00:38:12,607 --> 00:38:13,960
<i>Dismissed.</i>

501
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:17,796
Sir.

502
00:38:33,447 --> 00:38:36,996
Sharon, no.
What?

503
00:38:37,087 --> 00:38:40,557
Sharon, we're done. It's over.

504
00:38:42,927 --> 00:38:46,078
- What do you mean it's over?
- I love you.

505
00:38:46,847 --> 00:38:48,405
I really do.

506
00:38:50,927 --> 00:38:52,280
I'm sorry.

507
00:38:54,247 --> 00:38:55,760
Wait a minute.

508
00:38:56,207 --> 00:38:59,085
I deserve more of an explanation
than that.

509
00:39:02,047 --> 00:39:03,366
Sure.

510
00:39:04,687 --> 00:39:06,996
One of my men is in the Brig.

511
00:39:07,687 --> 00:39:11,521
He confessed to a crime he didn't commit
to protect me, to protect us.

512
00:39:11,607 --> 00:39:16,397
There can be no more "us. "
No more secrets, no more lies, that's it.

513
00:39:18,127 --> 00:39:19,480
It's over.

514
00:39:20,607 --> 00:39:23,883
I can't believe
you can just turn your back on us.

515
00:39:30,007 --> 00:39:32,760
I put everything on the line for you.

516
00:39:32,847 --> 00:39:36,362
Everything. I cover for you, I protect you.

517
00:39:36,447 --> 00:39:39,996
I risk my career, my freedom,
my integrity, for what?

518
00:39:40,087 --> 00:39:43,363
So some innocent kid,
one of my kids, can take the fall for me?

519
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:44,562
No!

520
00:39:50,007 --> 00:39:53,920
We are not worth that.

521
00:39:56,847 --> 00:39:57,996
Okay.

522
00:40:01,487 --> 00:40:02,761
Right.

523
00:40:04,327 --> 00:40:06,477
<i>I guess I'll see you around.</i>

524
00:40:07,727 --> 00:40:09,285
One more thing.

525
00:40:13,007 --> 00:40:15,760
Did you leave the hatch combing
open last night?

526
00:40:20,127 --> 00:40:21,321
What?

527
00:40:22,047 --> 00:40:25,596
Did you leave the hatch combing
open last night?

528
00:40:32,647 --> 00:40:34,399
What are you saying?

529
00:40:35,607 --> 00:40:38,997
That I helped the Cylon?
I didn't say anything.

530
00:40:39,527 --> 00:40:43,076
I'm just asking a question.
I think I deserve an answer.

531
00:40:47,087 --> 00:40:50,124
You have the only answer
you're ever gonna get.
