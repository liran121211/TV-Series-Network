The Cylons have detected them however and Starbuck loses consciousness after getting shot. She awakes in a hospital. A doctor, Simon, tells her it's a resistance hospital and that Anders has died in the attack. Starbuck doesn't trust it; no one else appears to be in the hospital and Simon expresses a scary concern about her ability to bear children. On Galactica commander Adama orders the entire fleet to be searched for the escaped president Roslin. Roslin decides it's time to play the religious card. She makes an appeal to the fleet to honor the Gods and follow her at the appointed hour to Kobol, where they will meet Gods' servant with the Arrow of Apollo.\u2014Arnoud Tiele (imdb@tiele.nl)", "Commander Adama has recovered sufficiently to resume command and orders that all ships be put into quarantine while they search for President Roslin, his son Lee and the others. Roslin for her part needs to galvanize her support and issues a message to the fleet saying that she is leader who is foretold in the scriptures of Pythias who is to lead them to the promised land. She asks all who believe in the prophecy to follow her to Kobol where they will learn the way to Earth. On Cylon-held Caprica, Starbuck wakes up in a hospital where she is recovering from the wounds she received in the firefight.
