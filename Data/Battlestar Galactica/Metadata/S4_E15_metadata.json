After the initial shock, she has a revelation as she remembers things she had forgotten. Present Day: Dr. Cottle is operating on Anders, who has a bullet lodged in his brain. Anders starts to remember things he had forgotten. Eighteen months ago: Cavil comes to see Ellen, who calls him John, because that's his \"real\" name. Cavil says he hates that name. John was the first Cylon model *Ellen* created. She also created seven others. So, there are actually only *eight* Cylon models and the \"Final Five\" are actually copies of humans who lived 2,000 years earlier and, together, created Resurrection, which allowed them and the Cylons to download. Number Seven, Daniel, was a favorite of Ellen. Jealous, John sabotaged the process of using Resurrection on Daniel, making him unique. John and Ellen start a months-long philosophical and ethical argument on Cylon - human interaction. John says he started the genocide of humankind because his \"forebears on the Centaurion side of the family were the slaves of humanity.\" And he wants justice for that. Present Day: Anders tells Starbuck that he has seen \"everything\" and needs Kara to get \"the others\" - Galen, Tory, Saul and Ellen to his bedside. Anders says he remembers everything and knows why they have come all the way to Earth... Adama reinstates Tyrol as a Chief of Engineering.
