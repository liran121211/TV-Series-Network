Meanwhile, Admiral Adama and crew send Lee Adama off into his new life as a member of the Quorum of Twelve, and Adama has to deal with the possibility that Kara Thrace may very well be right about her knowing how to get to Earth.\u2014Amezzeray", "Kara Thrace is convinced that the fleet is going in the wrong direction and manages to escape her guards and confront President Roslin. Her vision of the way to Earth is fading the longer they wait. The President thinks she's lying but but the Admiral isn't convinced either way. Tigh, Anders, Tyrol and Foster continue to meet in secret. Tyrol mentions that D'Anna Biers saw something in the Temple of the Five and perhaps Baltar could shed some light on it. On board a Cylon Basestar, some of the Cylons believe something extraordinary has happened and that the Hybrid is telling them that the Final 5 are in the Colonial fleet. John Cavil however tells them it is against the rules to talk about the Final 5 and is strictly forbidden. They are deadlocked however as the 6 remaining models split down the middle on reconfiguring the Cylon Raiders to ensure they will attack the Colonial fleet. Cavil has his own solution to that but it doesn't sit well with some of the others. Lee Adama says farewell to his shipmates as he leaves Galactica to join the Quorum of Twelve.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0993921", "rating": 7.9, "votes": 1804, "number_of_episodes": 74}
