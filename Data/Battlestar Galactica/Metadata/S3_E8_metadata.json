His return raises questions about why the Cylons launched their initial attack against the Twelve Colonies.", "Admiral Adama has to come to terms with a command decision he made three years ago. At that time, he was in command of a highly secret operation, black ops, to infiltrate as near as possible Cylon space to determine if they are arming for war. He sent out a scout ship under the command of Lt. Danny \"Bulldog\" Novacek, a close friend. Adama was forced however to make a decision that he regrets to this day. Novacek however has survived and after three years of imprisonment by the Cylons, has managed to escape in one of their fighters. He's welcomed back with open arms but Adama now questions if he can continue as the senior military officer and submits his resignation to President Roslin.
