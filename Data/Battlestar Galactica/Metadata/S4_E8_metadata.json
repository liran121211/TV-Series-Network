With the Basestar having jumped into hyperspace with President Roslin and Gaius Baltar on board, Tom Zarek assumes the interim Presidency. The fleet has lost more than the President however as they had already transferred an air wing to the Cylon ship pending the attack on the resurrection hub. When one of the Raptors returns, they find a crewman on board, dead. Admiral Adama simply won't support a Zarek-led government and Lee Adama tries to arrange a compromise. He gets Romo Lampkin to help him find the right candidate to replace Zarek as interim President. Adama learns that Col. Tigh has been having sex with Caprica 6 and that she is pregnant. Realizing that he will go to any lengths to find Roslin and that he has lost his objectivity, Admiral Adama comes to a major decision about his future.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0993930", "rating": 7.6, "votes": 1715, "number_of_episodes": 74}
