Unexpectedly, Colonel Tigh's estranged wife Ellen turns up alive in the fleet, apparently miraculously, raising the possibility that she might be a Cylon.", "Dr. Baltar has finished his Cylon detector and president Laura Roslin tries to convince commander Adama he should be the first to be tested. Since the Conroy copy told her Adama is a Cylon, she is getting more and more suspicious and even sends Billy to ask Dualla about his behavior. When suddenly a Cylon raider pops up behaving strangely, Adama is missing, raising more eyebrows. He returns however with Ellen Tigh, the presumed dead wife of colonel Tigh, who suddenly appeared. She claims she lost consciousness during the Cylon attack and was cared for on the Rising Star. Is she a Cylon? Back on Caprica, Helo notices a change in behavior of the centurions.

Dr. Baltar's Cylon detection process is now working - even if he isn't necessarily being honest about the results - and asks Adama to go first. He has been acting quite strange lately, making un-logged calls to other ships and even leaving the Galactica on a shuttle without filing a flight plan. He has a surprise however when he returns to the ship with Colonel Tigh's wife Ellen, who has been unconscious on another ship. He's brought her back reluctantly however, knowing the effect she will have on her husband.
