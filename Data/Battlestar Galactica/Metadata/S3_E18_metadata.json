The Admiral reviews her file in tears and Sam Anders gets drunk but Apollo can't quite bring himself to place her photo on the wall of dead crewmen, as he had promised. Preparations are being finalized for Gaius Baltar's trial and Admiral Adama is one of 5 people selected at random to serve on the tribunal. As Tom Zarek had predicted however there is violence with Baltar's attorney is killed. His new attorney is Romo Lampkin and it's only by chance that Chief Tyrol uncovers a bomb meant to kill the lawyer. The Admiral puts his son Lee in charge of Lampkin's security but the two don't exactly see eye to eye on what that means. For Lee, it means ensuring that the disgraced ex-President gets a fair trial and his revived interest in the law leads him to become more involved.\u2014garykmcd", "President Roslin has a dream where she is chasing Hera in the former opera house on Kobol. Athena and Caprica Six are there with her. Col. Tigh and Sam Anders hear a tune while sitting in Joe's bar but they seem the only ones who can hear it. Later, Presidential assistant Tory Foster hears the same tune. Gaius Baltar's trial is about to begin and he has to deal with a cult following who he considers to be a bunch of crazies. At his trial, the prosecutor points out that 5,197 people died or disappeared on New Caprica. Col. Tigh doesn't exactly help the prosecution when he appears drunk on the stand and eventually admits that he would do and say anything to see Baltar found guilty. Lee proves to be an effective member of the defense team scoring points in his cross-examination of President Roslin. It comes as a high personal cost however.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0947107", "rating": 7.6, "votes": 1892, "number_of_episodes": 74}
