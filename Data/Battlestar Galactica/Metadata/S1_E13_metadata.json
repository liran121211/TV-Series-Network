He orders an attack on Colonial One to end her reign. To retrieve the Raptor away team crashed on the surface of Kobol, he sends Boomer and Racetrack. They're supposed to nuke the Cylon Basestar in a Raptor with a Cylon transponder. While Starbuck is approaching Caprica, Boomer mentions to Helo they're at the temple of Delphi. Somehow she seems to know the importance of the arrow of Apollo. She tells Helo their relationship is important and that she actually has feelings for him.
