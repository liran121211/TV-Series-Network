Leoben Conroy and his comment to her that she has a destiny also figure prominently in her dreams. Tyrol suggests that she visit an oracle who repeats, word for word, what Leoben had told her. She recalls the difficult relationship she had with her domineering and abusive mother. She also begins to doubt her own mental state when she begins seeing things that are not there.
