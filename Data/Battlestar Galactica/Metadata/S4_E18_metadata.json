Adama reluctantly comes to the conclusion that the Galactica has reached the end of its days. He orders all repair activities halted and decides to strip the ship and share everything that is salvageable with the rest of the fleet. Starbuck meanwhile shares with Gaius Baltar what she found on the uninhabitable Earth. He subsequently - and quite publicly - proclaims her to be an angel.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0993919", "rating": 7.8, "votes": 1662, "number_of_episodes": 74}
