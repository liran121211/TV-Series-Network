She orders that the fetus be destroyed and Admiral Adama agrees with her. Needless to say, Sharon will fight against it. Roslin is in the Galactica's infirmary and has a flash of memory: she sees Dr. Gaius Baltar talking with a Number Six in Caprica City. Chief Tyrol meanwhile finds that some of the ammunition aboard the Vipers has been sabotaged. The Admiral soon learns that there is a peace movement among the civilian population. They fear that explosives may have been placed on other ships that manufacture war materials for the Galactica and the Pegasus. Baltar is surprised to find that the Number Six he saved from the Pegasus brig, Gina, is now a member of the peace movement. She urges him to surrender to the Cylons when he replaces Roslin as President. Baltar refuses but also makes an important scientific discovery.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0519767", "rating": 7.4, "votes": 2027, "number_of_episodes": 74}
