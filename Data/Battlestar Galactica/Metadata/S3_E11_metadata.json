Just as Adama and Roslin are getting an update on the find, four Basestars appear but do not attack. Rather, the Cylons have a proposition for them: give them the Eye of Jupiter and all hostilities will cease. Adama and Roslin agree that under no circumstances will they surrender the find. To complicate matters further, Lt. Gaeta determines that the nearby sun is about to go supernova. Meanwhile, Boomer tells Athena that her baby, Hera, is alive but not well. Neither Athena nor Helo believe it but after getting the truth from Roslin, Adama confirms that it's true.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0887221", "rating": 8.1, "votes": 1928, "number_of_episodes": 74}
