00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07.120
- Then?
- Not now.

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08.960
It wasn't easy for me
to get admission here.

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:10.740
So, I'm not going to
miss my first class.

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13.460
Your story sounds way more
interesting than the class.

5
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15.210
Please tell me, what happened next?

6
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:17.390
Please tell me. Please.

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20.110
Then I asked madam to run!

[Title Montage]

9
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33.610
Wait a minute, Nand.
I'm confused. Calm down.

10
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:34.770
- Ma'am...
- Sit down, what has happened?

11
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:37.420
The ladies of this town
have decided to target you.

12
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41.780
I mean... they want to humiliate you
and kick you out of town.

13
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46.280
How can they do that?

14
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49.150
- I'm calling the police.
- Ma'am, don't be crazy.

15
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50.740
Why would you call the police?

16
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52.560
Those b*****s...

17
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56.810
Sorry... They will gang up with them.

18
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:02.350
This is Meerut. People will shoot
your video instead of helping you.

19
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:08.780
How can I go now?
Even Naveen isn't home.

20
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10.410
Call Naveen sir right now.

21
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13.540
- And leave once he's back.
- He'll be back at 6 in the morning.

22
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16.440
6 o'clock?

23
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27.140
Vipul? I need help.
Find Bhalle and get to work.

24
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29.570
It's urgent. Okay?

25
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:35.030
Ma'am, if it's ok with
you may I make a request?

26
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38.190
May I stay here tonight?

27
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40.660
Ma'am, I'm your student.

28
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43.480
And you have taught me that
there is nothing above 'respect'.

29
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:48.150
You don't have to stress.
You are my responsibility now.

Bhalle, M*********r.
Who eats at this hour?

32
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:04.350
I jerked off before sleeping so,
I'm starving.

33
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05.800
- What?
- Sit.

34
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08.600
- Where to?
- To chant prayers.

35
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10.050
Okay, let's go. Want some?

37
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25.200
Nand.

38
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30.520
There's water,
if you need something else...

39
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33.020
Ma'am, be comfortable. Don't worry.

40
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:36.610
Thanks, Nand.

41
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41.220
Okay, go ahead with your call.

42
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43.260
- Good night.
- Good night, ma'am.

[phone ringing]

44
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54.350
- Why didn't you pick up the phone?
- I was a little busy, tell me.

45
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56.790
- Did you see the picture?
- Picture?

46
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58.330
[Nand] 'No.' 

47
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01.200
- Didn't you see the picture?
- Why?

48
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02.550
What were you so busy with?

49
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04.470
Where are you?

50
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29.540
S****k, s**t, c**t, B***h.

51
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31.290
No...

There's no feel in b****h.

53
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35.720
What shall I say?

54
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38.060
Yes!

55
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40.110
W***e.

56
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41.470
Take a look.

57
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43.910
- How is it?
- Awesome.

58
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45.310
Switch off the light.

59
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47.900
Where are my sports shoes?

60
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:52.380
What is the occasion where you need
to deck up as well as run?

61
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55.500
Tomorrow is a very important day
for the ladies of Meerut.

[hymn playing]

63
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07.260
You go there.

64
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23.840
Okay?

65
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27.900
Then what are you wearing?
Show me.

66
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32.270
What?

67
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34.820
Where?

68
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41.270
What are you doing here?

69
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44.770
At least open the door. Dogs?

70
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52.270
I have told my parents
that I'm going to study at Rupali's.

71
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54.440
There are all night prayers
at her place.

72
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56.860
Yes. I'll put on some vermillion
before I go home.

- Morning, 10 o'clock. Old Market.

'It was a treat to watch the
dedication and devotion of the men.'

'There was an idol
of a lady being worshiped...'

'...while other ladies were
having their dignity stripped.' 

82

'After all, they were looking forward
for the blessings of Rasbhari...' 

83

'...how could they focus
on this prayer?' 

84
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05.490
Yes, it's done.

85
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11.660
- Say something.
- Hmm?

86
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14.540
- What are you looking for in the phone?
- Shhh. Talk softly.

Ma'am is sleeping.

88
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:17.940
Is she alone?

Shut up.

Really?

91
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22.830
You are taking her side.

92

That's why I'm here.

93
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:27.850
I'm well aware of her reputation.

- Me and ma'am?
- Why?

She didn't spare Rahul from B- tech.

- And you're...
- Hot? Hmm?

Listen to me first.

But that's not Shanu ma'am.

- Huh?
- Hmm.

00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52.580
What do you mean?

How do I put this?

- Yes.

She is Shanu madam
but not Shanu madam.

110
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:10.790
So...

111
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12.160
What are you trying to say?

112
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:13.890
That's exactly what I'm
trying to explain.

113
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30.790
So, kid...

114
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33.550
Who's this beauty?

115

- Madam...
- Okay!

116
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:45.510
So, this is the fairy whose love
stops you from getting close to me.

117
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50.340
A teenage beauty.

118
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52.330
Innocent face.

119
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54.870

Let me see...

122
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03.450
...what's so special about her.

123
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28.280
Come here.

124
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32.460
Let me change the flavour.

125
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52.000
Excellent, kid.

126
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54.720
Along with English,
you've learnt this too.

127
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57.260
Come.

128
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:59.750
Let's see how much
you have really learnt.

I have done a night shift
after a long time, Pappu bhaiya.

131
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32.700
Yeah, I could see that.

132

Hey, Doe-Kay.

133
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36.000
Look at this.

134
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39.910
What are these men whispering
to each other?

[phone ringing]

136
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46.650
Yes, Pushpa ji.

137
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49.540
Of course, I remember.

138
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52.470
Don't you worry.
Trust me.

139
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56.000
We will take out such a procession...

140
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:59.010
...that it will be only you
and Arnab on tonight's primetime.

141
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00.940
Hail goddess Durga.

142
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02.900
Hail goddess Durga.

143
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07.430
I'm all set. You leave.
Even I am leaving.

144
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09.020
Yes.

145
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14.300
Listen. There are three quesadillas
in the casserole.

146
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16.270
There's curd too. Please have it.

147
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:18.490
I'm leaving.
I'll be back in the evening.

148
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:21.640
Where are you off to
on a Sunday all decked up?

149
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23.310
I have some work.

150
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25.750
Stop this inquiry.

151
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30.620
The inquiry will start when I'm back.

152
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:34.910
Sir, hello, sir.

153
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37.950
Naveen, things are happening here
just like Hapur.

154
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39.060
History is repeating itself.

155
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41.900
Why didn't you tell me
that Rasbhari is back, Naveen?

156
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43.590
- Shhh... Shanu.
- You...

157
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45.130
Everything will be alright.

158
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47.740
- Sir...
- How will it be alright, Naveen? How?

159
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:50.540
Sir. Sir, let's go.
They will be here anytime now.

160
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53.390
- Come on.
- Come on. - Come on...

161
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58.150
Dear sisters.

162
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59.990
Today, we're going to save
our husbands from that...

163
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04.260
...b***h, s**t, w***e, s***k.

164
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07.340
Come on, let's march on her.
March!

165
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27.450
Naveen, did you check everything?

166
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30.280
There is some cash lying
below the idols... So sorry.

167
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32.610
- Will be back.
- Yes, Vipul.

168
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36.060
Come here quickly.
Okay.

169
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:38.930
Nand.

170
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41.220
What happened last night?

171
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44.930
You know what happened.

172
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47.520
Not what happened between us.

173
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50.300
That...

174
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51.510
Who was she?

175
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53.150
That's what I was trying to explain.

176
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55.000
She was not Shanu madam.

177
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:58.780
- Nand. Yes.
- Shall we leave?

178
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00.480
Let Pappu come.

179
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02.430
Then we will attack.

00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03.620
-[vehicle honking]
- Move... -[Pappu] 'I am here.'

181
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04.700
- I am here...
- He is here.

182
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06.900
- Where have you been?
- Come on.

183
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:07.880
Doe-kay, get the camera.

184
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08.900
- Come...
- Let's go.

185
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10.760
- Are you all ready? Huh?
- Let's go. Yes.

186
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13.140
Come on, one, two, three...
Forward march!

187
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20.070
- Doe-kay, come here.
- Come in front. Yes. Come on.

188
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:21.870
What now?

189
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24.300
- Huh?
- I think they're not home.

190
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25.980
-[knocks the door]
- No.

191
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28.410
Something's fishy.

192
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33.810
- Let's break the lock and get in.
- And do what?

193
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37.230
What I will do at home,
I don't know.

194
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39.390
My husband left early in the morning.

195
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42.540
- Even my husband went out.
- And mine was wearing perfume.

196
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45.400
Nand's father has gone out too.

197
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47.510
- What's going on?
- I have no idea.

198
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56.660
Wait a minute.
I know what's happening.

199
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:00.090
Do you all want to catch
that w***e red-handed?

200
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02.080
- Of course.
- Come with me.

201
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04.120
Your husbands will be found there too.

202
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06.200
Old market. Let's go.
Doe-kay, get the camera.

203
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09.690
Come on. Hurry up...
It's 10 o'clock already.

204
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10.670
Make it fast.

205
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12.360
Old Market. Okay?

206
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24.980
Yes, Bhalle. Come on...
Hurry up.

207
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28.470
Madam, let's go.

208
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40.060
Sir, ma'am, please come.
I'm coming with you.

209
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41.670
Vipul, take Priyanka with you.

210
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45.610
Bhalle, come here, you rogue.

211
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48.200
Snacks on me for the whole year.

212
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50.570
Got it? Let's go. To the bus station.

213
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54.900
Class?

214
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56.800
Everybody was told...

215
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00.370
...that Shanu ma'am class
will be held at the Old Market.

216
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04.050
But no one thought about...

217
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05.700
...where exactly this class will be.

218
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08.220
Lust took over your brain.

219
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09.540
- Huh?
- Yes.

220
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13.190
Tyagi bhai, when the brain
in our pants starts thinking...

221
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15.490
...the brain in the head
stops working.

222
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:18.850
Hey, there she is.

223
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50.300
[Pushpa] 'Today,
I'm going to finish her.'

224
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51.990
Doe-Kay, get the camera
and set the mic.

225
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53.830
-[Pappu] 'Come on, let's go.'
-[Pushpa] 'Today...'

226
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12.110
Where did she go?

227
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15.130
She must be here.

228
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17.440
- She must be here.
- Knock the door.

229
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:18.770
Come on.

230
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22.450
[knock on the door]

231
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24.120
Madam?

232
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:26.480
Madam?

233
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28.110
- You'll find everyone here.
- Where are they?

234
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:29.990
Switch it on.

235
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32.300
I'm Pappu Tiwari, from Meerut.

236
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34.670
- Look at how the women of this city...
- Move.

237
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36.320
...are going to kick a
characterless woman... Move...

238
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38.600
- ...are going to kick her out.
- You men can't control your lust?

239
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40.670
- Look, how aggressive...
- Whose door are you knocking?

240
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44.670
...these women are.
Look, let's get in.

241
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54.270
Yeah. What is it?

242
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57.690
- Come on, record now.
- Hey, cut it.

243
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00.560
[Pappu] 'Cut it.'

244
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:07.670
I wanted to thank you.

245
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09.560
For what, madam?

246
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:11.830
For saving me.

247
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14.550
For saving us actually.

248
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18.070
Shanu...

249
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20.110
- Come.
- Yes.

250
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:24.470
- Ma'am, take this.
- Okay, bye, Nand.

251
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29.330
I'm very happy that I met you.

252
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31.230
Me too, ma'am.

253
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33.020
Take care.

254
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36.810
Take care of yourself and
your English too.

255
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38.160
Sure.

256
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40.500
Best of luck.

257
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42.920
Bye.

258
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46.620
- Give it here.
- Sir, excuse me.

259
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48.540
Seat number seven.

260
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53.560
Come on, sit there.

261
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58.290
- Study well.
- Okay.

262
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01.400
Yeah, okay.

263
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12.590
Take care.

264
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15.390
Take care of yourself and
your English too.

265
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18.270
Excellent, kid.

266
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20.540
Along with English,
you've learnt this too.

267
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26.240
The next day, Shanu was normal.

268
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29.750
Like what happened
last night was a dream.

269
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:32.690
- Did Rasbhari return?
- Yes, once or twice.

270
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:36.880
But when she came,
Shanu didn't have a clue at all.

271
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39.140
Shanu madam mentioned English. 

272
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42.640
Even Rasbhari mentioned it. 

273
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46.730
So, if Shanu madam doesn't know
what Rasbhari does... 

274
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:50.120
...then how does Rasbhari know
what Shanu madam does? 

275
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:55.090
[Shanu] 'Take care.'

276
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57.890
'And take care of your English too.'

277
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00.440
[Rasbhari] 'Excellent, kid.'

278
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02.850
'Along with English,
you've learnt this too.'

279
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:18.810
F**k!

280
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21.490
- That means...
- That means...

281
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24.890
...Shanu madam and Rasbhari
were the same.

282
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:27.850
I don't know, man.

283
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:33.810
But I know for sure that this was
the most exciting chapter of my life.

284
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36.800
- Oh, man.
-[Niharika] 'Hello students.'

285
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:44.970
I'm Niharika Sharma, your
communication strategy instructor.

286
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46.580
Now, by the way of introduction...

287
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:50.030
...you might find that I'm the most
important person in your life...

288
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:52.040
...this semester.
And that is because...

289
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53.530
...this class is going to decide...

290
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56.160
...which one of you is going
to get a job in an MNC.

291
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58.780
And which one of you are going
to work in a local factory.

292
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00.100
There are three parts
of this course...

293
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02.880
...spoken English, written English
and the most important one...

294
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:05.830
...group discussion.
I have some rules for this class.

295
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08.160
-[Niharika] 'First rule...'
- F**k. She's so hot.

296
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10.910
I am sure you will forget Shanu madam.

297
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:14.030
Save both our time and get out
of this class as soon as I enter.

298
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15.530
[Niharika] 'The second rule
is more important.'

299
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16.770
'I don't care what you're saying...'

300
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:19.630
...whether you understand it or not
but as long as you're in this class...

301
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21.900
...we're going to speak
to each other only in English.

302
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23.850
- Understood?
- Yes, ma'am...

303
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26.090
Good. Any questions?

304
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28.350
Yes.

305
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:34.210
Ma'am, I just want to know if
you're familiar with a Shanu ma'am...
