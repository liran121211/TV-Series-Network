1
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08.520
She must be innocent too.

2
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12.040
Did you watch Raveena's new song?

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13.400
Tip tip barsa paani? 

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14.360
I don't watch
such songs at home.

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15.560
It will have a bad influence
on kids.

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18.820
He has been a spoilsport
all his life. Come on.

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21.150
My little one.

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23.190
He troubles me all day.

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24.880
Yesterday he walked
up to me and said...

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27.080
..."Mom, I want to marry."

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30.120
- He is six years old right?
- Yeah.

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33.560
- Did he say who he wants to marry?
- Yes, he did.

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34.880
Listen, dear.

14
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38.330
What was the name of the girl
Munna wanted to marry?

15
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41.360
- Ayesha Jhulka.
- Yes, Ayesha Jhulka.

16
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:42.230
Ayesha Jhulka?

17
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45.960
Oh, yeah. She did a song
with Akshay, right?

18
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48.640
Wearing a wet sari?
In the movie Khiladi.

19
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50.160
- Yes, Khiladi.
- Yes, she's the one.

20
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53.220
And when I asked him
why he wants to marry...

21
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56.120
...he said, "Mom, I can't
control my urges."

22
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59.860
He has taken after his father.

23
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03.580
- Mom, listen.
- Tell me, dear.

24
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05.800
I'm done with my homework.
Can I dance now?

25
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07.700
Sure. Show everybody
how good a dancer you are.

26
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11.560
She has been practicing
for a week now.

27
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:14.500
She wants to perform
in front of you all.

28
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16.620
It's a good thing, you know.

29
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19.240
Girls should learn a bit
of dancing and singing.

30
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22.680
She's going to make
a pleasing wife, you see.

31
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28.560
Look, she's dancing.

32
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:56.050
Your daughter is something.

33
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58.680
She will not just please
her husband...

34
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01.100
...she will please
the whole neighbourhood.

35
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03.900
I told you, Dinesh...

36
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05.750
...such things will spoil the kids.

37
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20.040
'Naveen, this is not fair.'

38
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21.290
It's a new city.

39
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22.840
How do you expect me to stay
alone for a week?

40
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25.410
- Darling, I'll call you.
- Nonsense.

41
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28.680
Listen. I love you.

42
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31.760
I know.

43
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36.570
- I can't go.
- Don't go.

44
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39.760
- I'm leaving.
- No.

45
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42.260
- Bye.
- Bye.

46
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43.160
Take care.

47
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48.200
Past participle form
of the verb...

48
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50.770
...and this can be
regular or irregular.

49
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53.080
- Is that clear?
- Yes, ma'am.

50
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55.320
Okay, now who can give
an example...

51
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58.140
...of a sentence
in past perfect tense?

52
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00.470
Any... Yes, Pooja.

53
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04.000
Nand had made all the girls...

54
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07.280
...his sisters before he finished
first term.

55
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12.470
Okay. Calm down.

56
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14.180
Akash, you want to stand
in the dustbin?

57
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16.760
Quiet. Okay, quiet.

58
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17.720
Quiet!

59
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:20.850
Yes. Thank you, Pooja.

60
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22.360
That is a correct example.

61
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26.330
And by the way, there's nothing
wrong in what Nand has done.

62
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31.200
It only means that he cares
for the girls in the class.

63
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34.740
Yes, Nand?

64
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37.800
Yes, ma'am.

65
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41.380
Okay. Now the future
perfect tense...

66
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43.160
Ma'am took your side.

67
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45.200
You're going to get lucky, too.

68
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49.160
Perfect continuous denotes
an action that has started...

69
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51.400
...at some point in the past...

70
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:55.550
...but is continuing to
the present. For example...

71
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03.050
'What else
should have I asked?'

72
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05.430
- Nand, my brother.
- 'Brother?'

73
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10.230
Of course. I tied him a rakhi
two months ago.

74
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13.600
But you are friends with him now,
ask him out.

75
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16.070
No, I'm not going to ask.

76
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18.230
If he wants me to go
with him to Mc Mavana...

77
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19.170
...he should ask me out.

78
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:22.990
Priyanka, you're really innocent.

79
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25.600
You have no idea
that the boys of this city...

80
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28.160
...are hanging out
somewhere else these days.

81
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29.100
What do you mean?

82
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32.860
I mean...

83
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37.080
...the boys have found a place
to satisfy their lust.

84
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45.760
I should be getting paid
for sitting in this class.

85
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49.240
He farts all the time
in his class.

86
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50.260
Forget it.

87
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55.470
Nand.

88
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25.890
Dude, you're too lucky.

89
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26.880
Listen.

90
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29.330
- Catch a rickshaw today.
- But why?

91
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32.530
- I have to go somewhere.
- With Priyanka?

92
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35.980
I don't mind giving you my scooter as
it is going to be your special day.

93
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41.080
Here you go.
Let's go.

94
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47.450
Although I was roaming around
with Priyanka... 

95
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51.690
...I was consumed by
the thought of Shanu ma'am. 

96
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08.880
Priyanka, it's too crowded.

97
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10.520
Shall we go elsewhere?

98
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15.910
Go get a veg meal.
let's eat outside.

99
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41.840
Priyanka, I'm short
of 50 rupees.

100
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43.320
But a meal costs only 90.

101
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44.910
Yes, you're right.

102
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01.890
No. I'm done.

103
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04.060
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

104
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06.920
- Thanks.
- It's okay.

105
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12.990
- Can I tell you something?
- Yes.

106
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16.230
Do you know why I came out
with you today?

107
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17.490
Why?

108
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21.630
When Shanu ma'am
said that you are...

109
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25.930
You are...
Caring for people.

110
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32.220
I realised Shanu ma'am has a point.

111
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35.710
- That's not true.
- What?

112
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37.650
Don't you care for people?

113
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42.140
I mean, I do care
but not the way she said.

114
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48.680
Look, who you are
and what you are...

115
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52.300
...can only be known by a person
who spends time with you.

116
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56.680
For example, if you pick me up...

117
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58.140
...in the mornings and evenings
to tuition...

118
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01.660
...I'll get to know
what sort of a person you are.

119
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11.720
I hope you got my point.

120
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14.380
I got it.

121
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15.800
- Really?
- Yes.

122
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18.220
Then?

123
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21.000
Then... Done.

124
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26.170
Where?

125
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29.880
Hurry up. Come on.

126
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:37.410
Pull over here.
Mom might see us.

127
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46.350
Okay. Give me the number now.

128
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51.800
Give me yours.
I'll give you a missed call.

129
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54.620
I'm not asking for your number.

130
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58.720
- Give me your maid Veera's number.
- What?

131
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01.080
Are you going to take
Veera to tuitions?

132
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02.600
Why would I take her
to tuitions?

133
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05.580
M-Mom wants her number.
That's why I'm asking.

134
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:06.330
Come on.

135
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09.480
Please give me, sis... That...

136
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11.430
We're friends after all.

137
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14.400
Write it down.

138
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17.340
'I fed you
when you were a baby, Nand.'

139
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:18.970
You used to latch
on to me...

140
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20.620
...while I used to clean
your house.

141
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23.450
That's why I'm telling you,
Veera.

142
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24.820
Please agree to it.

143
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26.670
Give me the money first
and tell me what's the job.

144
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29.600
I don't have money to eat
at Mc Mavana.

145
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34.030
Veera, let me tell you
the job first.

146
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:36.490
Let's talk about
the payment later.

147
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37.820
Get me the turmeric.

148
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42.370
You know, there's a new
tenant at Sirohi's house.

149
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46.280
I want you to visit them
and put up an act.

150
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48.680
Like, you need a job.
That you're a poor woman.

151
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51.640
I'm not a poor woman. I've saved
more money than your dad.

152
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53.280
Then why are you
demanding money from me?

153
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54.460
Get the hell out of here.

154
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56.160
Well, listen to me.

155
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58.240
After you start working there...

156
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:02.220
...you have to report to me every
evening about who visits her, okay?

157
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05.000
It will cost you Rs. 500.

158
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07.630
All right.

159
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10.450
Now tell me the truth.
Why?

160
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12.360
I can't tell you why.

161
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19.410
I'll charge you Rs. 1000 then.

162
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26.500
Okay. I'll pay you Rs. 1000.
All right?

163
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29.300
You have to pay me as soon as
I get the job.

164
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34.540
Well, I got the seed of this idea
from Priyanka. 

165
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37.000
But now I'd to wait and see... 

166
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40.860
...if it would work on Shanu ma'am 

167
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:48.260
Why does mom have to setup
her kitty here?

168
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:56.430
Come on, stop crying.
Must be a mosquito bite.

169
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59.660
No mosquito will pick a spot
to bite, will it?

170
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02.350
I used to bite him there before...

171
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:03.990
...but he didn't like it.

172
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06.950
He used to say that his colleagues
will make fun of him.

173
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:09.480
He has become
a shameless hypocrite now.

174
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13.650
Your husband loves you so much.

175
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15.540
Everyone knows it very well.

176
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18.150
'He bought you a sari
recently, didn't he?'

177
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21.440
I lied to you all about it,
Sushma.

178
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25.000
It was my sister-in-law's sari
from Khatauli.

179
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29.160
Okay... Stop crying.

180
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33.570
I just don't believe this.

181
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37.960
What sort of a spell that witch
must have cast on him?

182
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42.270
There's a solution
for such a problem, you know.

183
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44.550
Didn't you use the sorcerous act
suggested by Guruji?

184
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46.120
I did it, Sushma.

185
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48.150
- I did that too.
- Then?

186
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51.320
But still he's in total control
of that witch.

187
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56.440
Tell me! She is a teacher.

188
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58.740
She's going to be a bad influence
on students.

189
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01.390
'Pushpa.'

190
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:05.870
Gradually, she's going to get the
whole of Meerut in her petticoat.

191
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08.400
What do we do about this?

192
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09.920
What can we do?

193
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14.200
- Nand.
- Yes, Mom.

194
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15.680
Why are you standing over there?

195
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17.780
I'm coming.

196
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22.540
Why are you eavesdropping
on us ladies?

197
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24.420
Keep the tea here
and go to your tuitions.

198
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29.230
- Dear Nand.
- Yes, Aunty.

199
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32.270
There's a teacher named
Shanu Bansal in your school, right?

200
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34.240
- Yes...
- Is she good?

201
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36.680
She's a great teacher, Aunty.
She teaches from heart.

202
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39.560
Listen, dear.
Stay away from her.

203
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42.720
What? Are you out of your mind?

204
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44.790
What are you saying to him?
He is still a kid.

205
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48.480
Why are you still here?
Go to your tuitions.

206
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52.760
Come on, have some tea.

207
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57.160
Tell me.

208
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02.720
I'm on my way.

209
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08.180
Attending first period will not make
you a topper, S**********r.

210
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11.040
I'll be there soon. Bye.

211
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:16.120
And she doesn't like spicy food.

212
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17.970
She's not into fried food.

213
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19.620
Why don't you tell me
also the colour of her shit

214
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22.560
Give me some useful information,
Veera.

215
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33.320
By the way, the husband
and the wife are deeply in love.

216
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36.320
When I reached there today,
her nightie was unbuttoned.

217
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40.240
And her husband didn't come out
of the room for a long time.

218
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44.010
- And?
- Nothing. I told you everything.

219
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46.720
- There must be something.
- And...

220
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:50.190
Well, the husband is going
out of town for three days.

221
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51.760
This is what I'm talking about.

222
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:56.450
You have to keep an eye on who
visits her, for how long and why.

223
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58.260
Do you understand?
Come on, take it.

224
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01.640
- Remaining money?
- Remaining?

225
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04.160
You will get it when you give me
some useful information.

226
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05.480
Hey.

227
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09.560
I won't be able to sit
behind Rupali today.

228
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12.320
Nothing will happen by sitting
behind her...

229
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14.960
...sit next to her, if you really
want to score with her.

230
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:17.140
You talk as if you sit
on Priyanka's lap.

231
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18.280
Eyes on the road.

232
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21.350
S**********r.

233
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40.280
Nand, way to go.

234
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48.280
Look at this.

235
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:51.050
Who did this?

236
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53.600
A*****e, you are acting innocent
after doing the stunt

237
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56.020
I swear on you, Vipul.
I didn't do it.

238
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58.420
You both have been declared
as a couple in the school.

239
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59.760
You must have done something.

240
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01.850
Look around. Everyone's showing
their respects to you.

241
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03.640
'Wonderful, dear.'

242
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06.800
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

243
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09.870
'Vikas. What are you doing!'

244
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11.920
'Go, stand at the back.'

245
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18.440
Do you want to have?
Here you go.

246
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33.600
25 girls have questioned me so far
if this is true.

247
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36.940
- So, tell me.
- What?

248
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38.460
Is this true?

249
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41.180
Are you crazy?

250
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42.840
Writing names
in a heart symbol...

251
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43.940
...doesn't start an affair.

252
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46.480
Ashima and Pranav's love story
began the same way.

253
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48.060
Everybody thought
they were a couple...

254
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49.600
...and gradually they became one.

255
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51.610
That rascal must have written.

256
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54.680
Let go of me, b***h.

257
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57.190
You b***h.

258
00:16:58,290 --> 00:16:59.930
I'm your classmate
since second grade...

259
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00.880
...and your best friend, too.

260
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02.080
That doesn't mean you can
pull my hair.

261
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05.120
I know that's your handwriting.

262
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15.360
Don't tell anyone...

263
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19.490
...it looks good, right?

264
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26.070
Dad, don't send me to school
as I'll be managing the shop.

265
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28.320
I send you to school
because I don't want you...

266
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30.270
...to run this store for a living.
Got it?

267
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32.280
Stop staring at me.

268
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34.680
Just sit here for 30 minutes.
Phool will manage the rest.

269
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37.180
Come on!
Idiot.

270
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43.920
♪Oh, your slim waist...♪

271
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54.360
Darling, pick it up.

272
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56.390
Whom are you calling darling?

273
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00.990
Is she your girlfriend?

274
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:06.460
She?
No... Just like that.

275
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10.370
Well, Priyanka...

276
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13.740
- ...I didn't draw the heart.
- I know.

277
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16.480
You are not that kind of a boy.

278
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20.920
So, you didn't come here
to yell at me!

279
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22.800
I'm here to shop.

280
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26.000
What?

281
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30.330
Do we get vegetables here

282
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32.370
You are right.

283
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35.940
Go ahead. Phool!

284
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:39.450
Show it to ma'am.

285
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42.480
What do you want me to show?

286
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00.560
How much for this?

287
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03.730
- Phool.
- 'Yes, sir.'

288
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06.120
How much does this one cost?

289
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:10.940
It's a honeymoon item.
Sir got it from Delhi.

290
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:13.930
I didn't ask its history.
What's its price?

291
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15.820
250.

292
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18.520
You can pay 200.

293
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20.600
Sir, it's less than
the breakeven price.

294
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26.120
So, which one do you want?

295
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29.360
Whichever you like.

296
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36.200
- How about this one?
- It's good.

297
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40.260
Phool, pack this.

298
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51.280
Day after tomorrow there's
a festival in Model School.

299
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54.040
So, I was thinking...

300
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57.280
- ...we both might...
- One second.

301
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03.000
Yes.

302
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06.280
Now?

303
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09.550
All right.
I'm coming right away.

304
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:11.290
Okay.

305
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14.960
Priyanka, there's an emergency.

306
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17.820
You can... Phool,
collect 200 rupees from ma'am.

307
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20.660
See you tomorrow. Bye.

308
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24.330
Ma'am, money.

309
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30.720
- What's this?
- I'm returning your money.

310
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33.030
Are you crazy, Veera?

311
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:34.810
No, I'm not.
But the entire city has gone crazy.

312
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36.440
They all have cooked up
stories about her.

313
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:40.130
She does that,
this and she goes after men.

314
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41.320
That's what I wanted to find out.

315
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42.960
I've found out. It's all lies.

316
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46.720
I haven't seen such a good woman
in my life before.

317
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48.200
I quit working at four houses...

318
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49.810
...now I work for her full-time.

319
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52.000
Are you blind, S*********r!

320
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05.960
Come on, stop crying.
It must be a mosquito bite. 

321
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:10.180
Mosquitoes don't pick places
to bite.
