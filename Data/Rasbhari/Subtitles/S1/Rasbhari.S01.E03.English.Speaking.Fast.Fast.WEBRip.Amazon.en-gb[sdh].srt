1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10.170
Mom, hurry up.
I'm getting late for tuitions.

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14.010
Are you getting late for the tuition
or to meet that w***e(?)

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16.000
It was not my mistake, Dad.

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18.260
Manju asked me to stay back
in the school, that day.

5
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:19.850
I didn't know what she was up to.

6
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22.510
Yes. As if you were born
only yesterday(!)

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24.720
And your milk teeth are
yet to fall, right! (?)

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28.450
Stop accusing my boy.

9
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30.490
He's so handsome.

10
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32.150
No wonder girls hit on him.

11
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33.900
Straighten up, my dear.

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35.170
Oh, Mother India(!)

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37.470
Have you prepared
breakfast for me...

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39.400
...or should I go out
and eat some junk(?)

15
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41.320
Go, ask your daughter Shanu
to cook some breakfast.

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43.580
She's weeping in her room
for no reason.

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45.520
Weird family.

19
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13.120
You know that...

20
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15.990
...the manager of Ashoka Talkies
is my friend, don't you?

21
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19.840
Look, dear.

22
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:22.970
No one will be bothered
that there were seven girls.

23
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25.950
They will only gossip that the girls
were with three boys.

24
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29.570
This town would have made it
impossible for us to live here.

25
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:33.130
You are a good girl, aren't you?
This is for your own good.

26
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39.080
Come on, get up...

27
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41.160
...and make your dad
tasty breakfast.

28
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43.280
Come on, get up.

29
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:58.460

[door bell ringing]

33
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30.450
The maid is extremely punctual.

34
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:34.070
Tell her that your husband
is going out of station.

35
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37.160
And he needs the dosage
for three days(!)

36
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41.040
You can get your dosage
anytime you want.

37
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43.920
But I won't find another
good maid like her.

38
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46.420
Thank God I found her
as soon as we shifted here.

39
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49.520
Do you remember we had a problem
finding a maid in Hapur?

40
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59.760
I don't want to think about Hapur.

41
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10.160
Listen.

42
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24.290
Hello, ma'am.
I'm not late, right?

43
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36.000
[Pushpa coughing]

44
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37.580
You're home.

45
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40.050
- Should I get water?
- I'm not thirsty.

46
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41.520
Did you hear this?

47
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44.950
Guruji told her...

48
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48.450
...that her husband shouldn't touch
even a drop of water for a month.

49
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50.990
I'm not omnipresent
like your Guruji.

50
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54.640
Whom did he say this to,
who shouldn't touch, whose drop?

51
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58.910
Well...
Snehlata...

52
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01.080
Guruji told Snehlata...

53
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05.040
...to keep her husband away
from water for one month.

54
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08.580
That means he shouldn't touch
even a drop of water for a month.

55
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11.600
Only then he will be saved
from that w***e.

56
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13.380
You women are unbelievable.

57
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:17.810
You buy everything
that the Guruji sells. Snehlata!

58
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25.460
Pushpa...

59
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28.300
...deduct Rs. 50 from
Nand's pocket money.

60
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31.190
He's giving discounts
to his girlfriends(!)

61
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33.800
What's wrong?

62
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36.680
Are you hungry?

63
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40.260
Two rotis are left.
Shall I serve it with butter?

64
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42.720
Feed him and make him
as strong as a bull.

65
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46.400
- He neither studies nor works.
- Shall I get it?

66
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55.520
Dad...

67
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:58.650
...I'll do it.

68
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02.000
What? Are you going
to work at the store?

69
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05.070
No, studies.
You were absolutely right.

70
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07.080
If I study well,
I don't have to work in your store.

71
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08.640
Very good.

72
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10.680
- Dad, I need a small favour.
- What is it?

73
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13.340
Arrange a tuition for me
and I'll top the class.

74
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17.430
Nice. But you already
go to private tuitions.

75
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19.400
Well, you better do it.

76
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23.680
He's in 11th grade now.
It might affect his 12th scores.

77
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27.000
- I'm not going to waste my money.
- Get it done.

78
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30.890
If he fails to score well,
he will blame us for that.

79
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32.450
Think a bit about your old age.

80
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35.360
Do you want some milk?

81
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46.140
All right. I'll talk
to the teacher in person.

82
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:47.750
Let's go then.

83
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50.260
- You mean now?
- Yes.

84
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55.320
Physics, chemistry, bio.

85
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59.040
- Does this teacher teach
all three? - No, Dad.

86
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00.540
- Then?
- English.

87
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05.180
You b*****d,
you want English tuitions.

88
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08.950
You sing that despacatito
the whole day anyway. Let's go back.

89
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11.180
Dad, without English, I won't be
able to do well in any of the exam.

90
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12.500
Ma'am is quite good
in teaching English.

91
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14.280
Learn English from your phone.

92
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:15.850
I'm not giving you the tuition fee.
Let's go.

93
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17.610
Who learns from the phone, Dad?

94
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20.320
You. Who else?
Will your father do it?

95
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32.350
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.

96
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37.560
I'm here to talk about
my son's tuition.

97
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39.710
- Tuition?
- Yes.

98
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43.180
He needs good English
to do well in his exams.

99
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48.800
It's very important, you know.

100
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:51.730
Yes, Dad.

101
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58.320
Pushpa.

102
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:01.170
Stop saying my name.

103
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11.640
- Tell me what it is.
- What do you want me to say?

104
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14.450
Why don't you tell me...

105
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17.170
...what you discussed
with that w***e?

106
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19.890
She's not a w***e.
She's Nand's teacher.

107
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23.120
You were the one
who asked me to talk.

108
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27.880
Now, I'm telling you
there's no need for any tuition.

109
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:31.990
He's in the 11th grade.
He needs tuition.

110
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35.380
Otherwise,
it might affect his 12th scores.

111
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37.320
[Pushpa] 'Really?'

112
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40.520
How come you have money
all of a sudden?

113
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42.080
If he fails to score good marks...

114
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44.100
...he's going to blame us
for that.

115
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46.960
Are we not going to think
about our old age?

116
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:52.440
Stop repeating my dialogues.

117
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56.480
Guruji was absolutely right.

118
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59.520
This dangerous w***e...

119
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02.190
...is going to ruin the whole city.

120
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03.540
Stop talking nonsense.

121
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06.710
- Have food.
- I'm not at all hungry.

122
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09.760
Pretty soon my thirst
will be quenched(!)

123
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:12.260
From tomorrow, I'll be visiting
her for tuitions.

124
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15.830
You will be jealous daily.
Soon there will be fire(!)

125
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19.040
Trust me.

126
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21.710
If I see you around her house...

127
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24.120
...I promise...

128
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26.560
...I will move back to Khatauli.

129
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29.160
Listen, dear...

130
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32.760
...I swear on you.

131
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36.270
I won't go there...

132
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38.720
...not even in my dreams.

133
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:11.540
My husband went to meet her
regarding Nand's tuition.

134
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14.140
Yes.

135
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20.520
That's what I'm scared of.

136
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25.220
I'm too confused.

137
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28.560
[door opening]

138
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33.720
Ma'am.

139
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48.040
Ma'am?

140
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:52.190
- Nand?
- Veera?

141
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55.400
Dad!

142
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58.000
Dad!

143
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15.810
Stop right there.
I can't let you in.

144
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18.640
- They placed an order.
- Ladies have asked...

145
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:22.910
- ...not to send men inside.
- What do I do with this?

146
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25.360
I'll take one...

147
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26.920
...distribute the rest
in the kitchen.

Six names are confirmed
who have done it with that teacher.

00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41.560
Six or seven?

154
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44.890
Have you not included
Snehlata's husband?

155
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48.980
You better worry about
your husband, Sushma.

156
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53.000
In every wedding,
your husband goes around...

157
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54.450
...misbehaving with other women,
grabbing other women by their waist.

158
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55.630
Really? All right.

159
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59.340
You are not stopping
your husband...

160
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01.000
...who has such a roving
eye on women.

161
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03.950
Instead you're pointing fingers
at mine.

162
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07.310
I'm just pointing fingers.

163
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11.080
Your husband always
points something else(!)

164
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12.270
- Look, what she's saying!
- That's it.

165
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16.640
This is the reason
why we women are doomed.

166
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:20.670
No unity. Everybody's lost
in their own world.

167
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:24.030
Ms. Pushpa,
please tell us what to do.

168
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:26.180
- You must agree to what I say.
- Sure..

-[Pushpa] 'Spying.'
-[Sushma] 'Spying?'

170
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32.390
Yes, spying.

171
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34.160
Everyday one among us...

172
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37.360
...will monitor Shanu's house.

173
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40.630
We'll keep an eye on who enters her
house and at what time they leave.

174
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:42.250
And the most important thing...

175
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46.120
??

176
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48.330
If you see any one
of our husbands...

177
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50.440
...entering Shanu's house...

178
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52.040
...you have to inform
us immediately.

179
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55.130
So that we can catch
that w***e red-handed...

180
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56.990
...and put an end to her act.

181
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01.280
You turned out to be very smart.

182
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04.180
Everybody gets smart when
it's a question of survival.

183
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07.420
Please get something to drink.
My throat is drying up.

184
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10.640
Waiter, what happened
to the refreshments?

185
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13.920
Oh, Lord Ram...
- What happened?

186
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16.770
Add another name to that list.

187
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20.220
- Whose name? - Veera.
- Veera?

188
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:24.420
- Are you sure?
- Even women?

189
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26.950
This witch won't spare anyone.

190
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31.620
[Nand] That was the first day
of my tuition. 

191
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34.920
'And I was imagining...'

192
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36.830
...make out sessions with ma'am. 

193
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39.640
Please sit down. 

194
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41.480
Hello, ma'am.

195
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:49.080
So, tell me, Nand?
- Yes, ma'am. Nand.

196
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51.840
Why do you want to learn English?

197
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57.070
Because...

198
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59.220
You don't have reason?

199
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00.800
No, ma'am. That...

200
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04.680
Ma'am, because this...

201
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:10.050
Ma'am, I want to speak
English like you. That's all.

202
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:12.590
You mean you want
to talk in English like I do.

203
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14.550
Yes, ma'am.
That's my reason.

204
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17.050
Good reason. Let's start.

205
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41.840
This is a diphthong.

206
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43.140
- Diphthong is a...
- 'Dipthong.'

207
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:45.310
- Diphthong.
- 'Dipthong.'

208
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49.480
- Diphthong.
- 'Thong' I can pronounce.

209
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51.070
I know what a 'Thong' is.

210
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:55.010
Ma'am, actually my father
owns an undergarment shop.

211
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57.160
So, thong I know.

212
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03.550
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, 'Do Bhai'.

213
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05.950
I'm going to take a shower.

214
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07.200
Let's eat after that.
Continue...

215
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09.550
'Shanu ma'am's husband made
me realise one thing...'

216
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12.040
'...that any young man
with determination...'

217
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14.350
'...can woo any hot girl
in the world.'

218
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16.810
Sir, can I have some more sherbet?

219
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:19.870
A*****e, you've already refilled
it ten times for 10 rupees.

220
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22.030
I'll let you put your stall
in the school next month.

221
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26.780
While you're sucking on this,
Jogi took away Rupali.

222
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32.620
I don't care, s**********r

223
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34.680
I can talk to Rupali
tomorrow in the school...

224
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38.100
...but this ice pop
will melt away.

225
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00.430
- Look there.
- Don't disturb me.

226
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:01.470
Come on, take a look.

227
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:25.310
What is Shanu ma'am teaching you?

228
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26.920
You have completely transformed
in four days.

229
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30.710
Thanks, bro. Appreciate it.

230
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33.640
So what's the plan?

231
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38.360
Idiot! He's our friend Nand, right,
s**********r!

232
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41.990
Baby, say hello to Nand
version 2.0.

233
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45.970
If I was a girl,
I would have given you some(!)

234
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47.560
I know.

235
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50.280
Were you able to impress
Shanu ma'am?

236
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52.840
I'm going to impress everyone.

237
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56.450
I'm going to kill it,
just watch me.

238
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58.470
[Priyanka] 'Hi, Nand.'

239
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02.090
One minute.

240
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05.980
- Hi, Priyanka.
- Hi.

241
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10.810
- You look good.
- Thanks.

242
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15.550
So any work you have?

243
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17.600
No, I was...

244
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18.960
I was...

245
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22.960
I wanted to fill a form online.

246
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25.080
I am not able to do it.

247
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:29.730
I was thinking, tomorrow,
if possible after tuition hours...

248
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32.920
...if you can come
to the internet cafe. - Yeah.

249
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36.210
- I'll do it.
- Thanks.

250
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38.620
It's okay.

251
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:46.970
- Nand, let me touch your feet.
- Get away from me.

252
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:51.950
Dude, any guy who goes
to the cyber cafe with a girl...

253
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54.920
- ...doesn't come back without a kiss.
- All right...

254
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59.030
- Come on, give me a hug, dear.
- Careful.

255
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24.630
What are you doing here?

256
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:27.990
Well, what are you doing here?

257
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31.260
You're too old to play
hide and seek.

258
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33.340
You will get a tight slap from me.
Why are you going there?

259
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36.860
- Tuition.
- Tuition? - Yes.

260
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:41.130
- Oh...
- Can I go now?

261
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43.880
- Or do you want me to stay?
- Get lost.

262
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48.520
So tell me Nand...

263
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:51.550
...have you understood active
and passive voice now?

264
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54.860
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay. Let's see.

265
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:58.390
The monkey is climbing the tree.

266
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01.490
Is this an active voice
or a passive voice?

267
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06.760
A-Active voice?

268
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:09.470
Correct, but speak
with confidence.

269
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12.930
- Confidence. Done.
- Okay. Now...

270
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:17.750
...tell me what will the passive
voice of the same sentence be?

271
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23.560
A tree is climbing
on a monkey.

272
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26.840
- No.
- I know, ma'am. I know.

273
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32.200
You know you're very funny
and very smart.

274
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36.070
If you put a little effort
you can top in every subject.

275
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38.920
Thank you, ma'am.

276
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43.540
Tell me,
what's your favourite subject?

277
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47.260
Now? English.

278
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52.280
- No. Tell seriously.
- Computer.

279
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13.330
Well, enter your Aadhar number.
That's it.

280
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15.280
We are done with your form.

281
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19.460
It's done.

282
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22.840
- Press the enter key.
- Oh, yeah.

283
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34.640
Thanks.

284
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37.670
Well, you're quite smart.

285
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41.840
Thanks.
Shall we go now?

286
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46.540
We've still got five more minutes.

287
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49.000
What do we do?

288
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51.030
Whatever you want.

289
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56.550
Priyanka, tell me something.

290
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:59.330
How can a boy know that a girl
is interested in him?

291
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05.700
She will give him small
hints, you know.

292
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08.480
Like...

293
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11.720
...a girl complimenting you.

294
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15.860
Or laughing at your jokes.

295
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:21.330
Or touching you like this
every now and then.

296
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30.430
- What's wrong?
- This is a hint, too.

297
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32.390
I'm a girl.
I can't kiss you first.

298
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34.040
So, the love is expressed
through anger.

299
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42.680
[Nand] We guys are d*******s. 

300
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45.870
With so much of courage the girl
shared her true feelings. 

301
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47.720
But we... 

302
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:51.510
We are lost in our dreams
instead of living the truth.
