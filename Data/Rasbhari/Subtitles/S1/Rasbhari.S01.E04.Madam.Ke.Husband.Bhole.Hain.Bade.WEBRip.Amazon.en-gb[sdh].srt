1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02.960
Is everyone here? Get closer.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07.110
Here you go. Have a look.

3
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:09.450
- It's amazing. - Very nice.
- Wow.

4
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:11.480
- We can click as many pictures.
- Yes.

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:12.970
- We don't need anyone's help.
- Yes.

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16.380
Well, what's your
daughter's education?

7
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18.560
Our son is a graduate.

8
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:22.210
As you know, girls study
for the sake of a degree.

9
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24.840
Therefore, I asked her
to take up...

10
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26.840
...cooking classes after her MPhil.

11
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28.790
She made these fritters.

12
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30.230
Why don't you have some?

13
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32.160
He's very choosy
about what he eats.

14
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34.050
He doesn't like fried snacks.

15
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:36.650
- You please have it.
- Yes.

16
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39.830
Well, I'll ask my daughter...

17
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43.320
- ...to get some salad
for you all. Okay? - Okay.

18
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51.740
You look so beautiful.

19
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54.870
Mom, does he look anything like
how he looked in that photo?

20
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58.060
He looks much better than that.

21
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00.700
He's very tall
and well-dressed too.

22
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03.260
He's a perfect match
for you, Shanu.

23
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05.400
Mom, stop exaggerating.

24
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07.550
Now don't say Shah Rukh Khan
himself is sitting in the hall.

25
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10.980
What does he do
for a living?

26
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15.190
Well, I just started working.

27
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17.950
No problem. What matters
is that you're working.

28
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20.800
- Having a job is very important.
- You're absolutely right.

29
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23.300
Well, here comes my princess.

30
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:48.970
[Title Montage]

31
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05.000
[Shanu] 'You're very funny
and very smart.'

32
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:09.020
'If you put little effort
you can top in every subject.'

33
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12.120
'By the way, there is nothing
wrong in what Nand has done.'

34
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15.610
It only means that he cares
for the girls in the class.

35
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:16.700
Yes, Nand?

36
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23.170
[Shanu] 'So, what do
you want to do today?'

37
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27.370
Ma'am, you say.

38
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:29.450
What do you want to do?

39
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32.400
Sit properly first.

40
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35.610
Okay, so...

41
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39.020
Give me an example of your own...

42
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41.410
...of a sentence in active voice...

43
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44.360
...and then the same sentence
in passive voice.

44
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52.700
Girls are loving me.

45
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57.740
And I'm being loved by the girls.

46
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:59.970
Wow.

47
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02.210
Well, that's correct.

48
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03.870
And I'm impressed.

49
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10.570
How dare you!

50
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12.160
Get up.
Get up and get out!

51
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13.390
Get out right now.

52
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16.810
- Ma'am, I thought that we...
- Thought what?

53
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18.190
What did you think?

54
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:20.150
That you can do anything
as I am being friendly!

55
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21.240
Get out of here.

56
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26.450
Bloody fool.

57
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32.730
Ma'am, why don't you
want to do it with me?

58
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:33.690
What?

59
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38.160
I mean, why don't
you want to...

60
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40.410
You're doing it
with the entire city...

61
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42.450
Aren't you ashamed, Nand?

62
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44.790
Aren't you ashamed? You get
out of here right now. Get out!

63
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53.350
I mean, Pappu, the cable guy
when you shifted here.

64
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55.310
Manoj,
Rahul the engineering student.

65
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58.030
- Professor Kaliya and many...
- Who are they, Nand?

66
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59.000
Who are they?

67
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03.610
Okay!
Don't you know them?

68
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04.980
I am hearing these names
for the first time.

69
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06.950
Get out of here. I don't
have time for this nonsense.

70
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08.200
I don't want to see you again.

71
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11.010
[Shanu] 'Don't you dare come back.'

72
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37.670
'Who are they, Nand?
Who are they?'

73
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40.940
'I am hearing these names
for the first time.'

74
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:43.350
'Get out of here. I don't
have time for this nonsense.'

75
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45.490
'I don't want to see you again.'

76
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49.050
'Don't you dare come back.'

77
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02.950
As they say,
when time doesn't favour you... 

78
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04.320
...everything goes wrong. 

79
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07.400
Even Priyanka blocked my number. 

80
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09.900
I was done for. 

81
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:30.270
Subject is acted upon.

82
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32.590
Chirag, Akash.

83
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:34.530
Get up.

84
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36.380
Akash, you go back to
your favourite place.

85
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:37.650
Get out.

86
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40.140
[Shanu] 'Give that phone.
Put that phone here.'

87
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43.620
Anybody else would
like to join him?

88
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:44.680
No, ma'am...

89
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46.960
- Is this clear?
- Yes, ma'am.

90
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48.750
- Any doubt?
- No, ma'am.

91
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50.320
Okay, now. Who can tell me...

92
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52.050
...what happens to the subject...

93
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55.570
...when we change from active voice
to passive voice?

94
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57.150
Anyone?

95
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:03.380
- Anyone?
- Put your hands down.

96
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05.150
Put your hands down.
Don't try to be a hero!

97
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:06.740
Sleeping in class, everyone?

98
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:08.690
Priyanka.

99
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11.420
What happens to the subject...

100
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14.000
...when we change from active voice
to passive voice?

101
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15.660
The subject...

102
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:19.810
...changes to the object.

103
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21.110
Say it with confidence.

104
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:24.600
The subject changes to the object.

105
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25.760
That's correct.
Sit down.

106
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28.000
Okay, now the verb.

107
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30.680
Please look at the verb
in the active voice.

108
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31.970
The verb is...

109
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33.110
[bell ringing]

110
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42.070
Don't repeat it.
Stupid.

111
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50.810
Ma'am.
Sorry, ma'am.

112
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53.510
- Ma'am. Sorry, ma'am.
- Shut up.

113
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55.320
Just shut up.

114
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58.980
Fortunately for yourself you have
committed this stupidity in my house.

115
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00.770
If you would have done
this same thing in class...

116
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01.880
...I would have got you expelled.

117
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04.780
Please count yourself very lucky
that you are still in this school...

118
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06.240
...and not in jail.

119
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08.060
Shameless.

120
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16.470
[Nand] 'Why did you block
my number, Priyanka?'

121
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17.920
Mister, hurry up please.

122
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19.750
[Man] Yes, I'm getting.

123
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22.670
Priyanka,
won't you talk to me now?

124
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:24.500
What has happened?

125
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26.190
[Man] 'Nand, what do I give you?'

126
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30.660
Give me anything worth 50 rupees.

127
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:35.540
So, Priyanka.
What have I done?

128
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:38.000
- Do you ever do anything?
- What do you mean?

129
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41.610
What! Don't act innocent.
I know everything.

130
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:42.970
What is it that you know?

131
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45.340
You have become so busy
since the time...

132
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46.350
...you started taking tuitions
from Shanu ma'am.

133
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48.030
I know what she is teaching you.

134
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50.520
There is nothing as such,
Priyanka.

135
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52.740
Is it? So, when are
you going to kiss me?

136
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54.000
Do you want me to write an email(?)

137
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55.370
Or should I ask my father
to come with a marriage proposal(?)

138
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57.710
- Priyanka, listen to me.
- Move!

139
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58.990
Don't touch me.

140
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01.550
Am I an idiot to talk to you
after getting humiliated?

141
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04.030
I don't want to see you hereafter.

142
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20.750
S**********r,
you are my true friend.

143
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22.500
He is just after my possessions(!)

144
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24.390
It's okay.
Everything will be fine.

145
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26.810
What do you mean?
What will be fine?

146
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28.130
This keeps happening...

147
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30.130
...in Bollywood, Hollywood
and everywhere else.

148
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32.620
Bro!
What I am going through
right now...

149
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33.590
...doesn't happen in any film.

150
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35.990
What, d******k!
That's what is called awkwardness.

151
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37.270
Huh?

152
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39.960
- The meeting after sex.
- Really?

153
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41.110
Yes.

154
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43.900
Didn’t you see that Priyanka
left without informing?

155
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46.280
People smoke cigarettes
after sex...

156
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47.750
...so that they can avoid
the 'awkward talk'

157
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50.010
That's not true.

158
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52.470
Forget it.
Touch his feet.

159
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:55.390
- Nand lost his virginity.
- The great Nand(!)

160
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58.680
Enough...
Enough, Pushpa.

161
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03.200
Happy anniversary, dear.

162
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:06.090
Happy wedding anniversary
to you too.

163
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:10.900
I just pray to Lord Ram...

164
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:14.280
...to keep us together forever.

165
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18.840
May the Lord fulfil all your desires.

166
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20.660
Don't you desire anything?

167
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22.250
You are my desire.

168
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26.550
Are you recording our video?

169
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29.370
Tell us.

170
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34.080
It would be a great deal if I could
click a photo in this useless phone.

171
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35.380
Don't talk nonsense.

172
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:37.310
Click a good photo.

173
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:39.100
I want to post it
in the family group.

174
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46.980
How can I click the photo...

175
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:47.920
...while you are standing 10 feet
away from each other?

176
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:48.650
Okay, we will get closer.

177
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51.070
Mom, stand a bit closer.
Don't be shy.

178
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52.540
- Come on, Pushpa.
- Yes.

179
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54.610
Come.

180
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58.930
- This is good.
- Is it any good?

181
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01.910
- So, now...
- Shall we go?

182
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:04.600
- Yes, let's go.
- Give me two minutes.

183
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:08.060
- I'll spray some perfume and come.
- Pushpa.

184
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12.410
How long are you going to see?
Give it to me.

185
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14.600
We will do the same old thing,
Sushma.

186
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16.780
First, we will go to Kanha Shyam...

187
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:19.910
...and have a dish
made of cottage cheese.

188
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:23.540
And we will have a paan
on our way back home.

189
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25.260
He will buy me flowers.

190
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26.640
That's all on our anniversary.

191
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28.460
How is your studies going on?

192
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30.140
Very good.

193
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:31.530
Are you going for tuitions?

194
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34.040
How is that coming along?

195
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:38.290
Will you speak up?

196
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:43.180
Dad, that... Chemistry tuitions
are going great, Dad.

197
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46.120
- What about English tuitions?
- Yes.

198
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49.170
The one you take from Shanu ma'am.
How is it going?

199
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57.870
You have lost it, Sushma.

200
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03.340
A man gets flatulence,
not sexually aroused...

201
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04.440
...after eating flatbread.

202
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06.880
What?

203
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11.630
Where is your father?

204
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13.010
At Shanu ma'am's house.

205
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15.740
Shanu ma'am's house.
Shanu ma'am.

206
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17.420
Shanu ma'am?

207
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24.110
Sushma, who is on duty
at that w***e's place?

208
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26.040
Everybody took a day off!

209
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:27.470
You should have
at least informed me.

210
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:30.330
- Nand.
- Yes.

211
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33.650
Go and check if your father
took the scooter or not.

212
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35.950
- Yes.
- Get up, go and check.

213
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38.490
Mom, I heard the sound of
the scooter when dad left.

214
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39.720
So, it's quite obvious.

215
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42.420
To hell with that w****e!

216
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45.590
Whose family is she
going to ruin today!

217
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48.100
[Pushpa] 'I am not
a woman of my words...'

218
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49.790
'...if I don't catch her
red-handed today.'

219
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03.760
What has happened?

220
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06.240
- Get a glass of water.
- Water.

221
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07.570
No need. It's okay.

222
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09.220
What has happened?
Tell me.

223
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11.990
- Do one thing, dear.
- Yes.

224
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14.840
Go. Go to Shanu ma'am's house.

225
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16.250
- Shanu ma'am?
- Yes.

226
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17.790
And if you...

227
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:22.220
If you find your father's scooter
there, just barge inside the house.

228
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:27.210
Why is there a question mark
on your face?

229
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28.760
Just go!
Hurry up.

230
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37.080
Ma'am, Nand is an idiot.

231
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40.220
As I got to know that he
misbehaved with you...

232
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42.670
...I rushed here.

233
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49.860
Ma'am, it's a request.

234
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53.180
Give tuitions to my Nand.

235
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57.400
I will even come and sit next to him
if you say so.

236
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02.200
Finger on my lip.

237
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15.470
You will have
to keep your lips open, sir.

238
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22.530
If you won't,
then I will have to do it.

239
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38.690
- Dad.
- What are you doing here?

240
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40.270
Mom sent me here.

241
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43.320
Yes, I am just going home.

242
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45.930
- Okay, listen.
- Yes.

243
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48.730
I spoke to your Shanu ma'am.

244
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51.820
She said that she won't
start the tuitions...

245
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53.840
...unless you go and apologise.

246
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55.550
Let me go and
apologise right away.

247
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56.590
No.

248
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58.960
No.

249
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01.020
She is not keeping well.

250
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04.940
Come in the morning tomorrow
to apologise.

251
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:07.410
Come on.
Come.

252
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:16.110
- Dad, it is automatic.
- I know.

253
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21.440
- Dad, it is automatic.
- I said, I know.

254
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28.450
Do you want me to whack you?

255
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:29.900
Hop on!

256
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43.060
I am going to my maternal home.

257
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45.350
Handle everything on your own.

258
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46.600
Nothing has happened.

259
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52.230
- Nothing has happened?
- Yes. Nothing has happened.

260
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53.490
Nothing has happened!

261
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56.380
This is what I wanted to hear!

262
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:59.320
Now, start defending that w***e.

263
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01.620
What do I do?
Nothing has happened!

264
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03.250
[Tyagi] 'Nothing has happened.'

265
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:07.030
That was a slap on my feelings
and not my face. 

266
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:12.530
I decided that I have to turn
Shanu ma'am's life a living hell. 

267
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24.080
Yes, Bhalla.
Tell me.

268
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25.740
Where are you?

269
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28.390
No. Don't ring the bell.

270
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29.890
Go back.

271
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32.130
Get on the scooter
and go to school.

272
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34.900
I am going to Delhi
to get some notes.

273
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38.510
D******d, how will I pack
an ice pop?

274
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:39.720
Hang up!

275
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49.410
Mom, I won't be able to come now.

276
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51.440
Are you blind, S**********r?

277
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52.980
Sorry, ma'am.
Sorry.

278
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57.150
Yes, ticket.

279
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:58.340
One minute, Mom.
Hold on.

280
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:00.220
- Where do you want to go?
- Give me a ticket for Moradabad.

281
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03.610
Ticket.

282
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:05.920
Ticket.

283
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07.530
I will throw you out of the bus
in the middle of the highway.

284
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09.240
Where do you want to go?

285
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15.030
I want to go where
that man is going.

286
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17.040
Why are you after that gentleman?

287
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19.900
No... He isn't a gentleman.

288
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:22.010
Come closer.

289
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23.440
- His wife...
- Yes.

290
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:26.820
- She is my sis...
She is my distant relative. - Okay.

291
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28.160
She has asked me to do this.

292
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32.510
The thing is that this gentleman...

293
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35.330
...is going to meet his girlfriend
making an excuse of work.

294
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:36.680
- What?
- Yes.

295
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40.230
Now, I need to find out
where he is going.

296
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:42.530
And then I will inform his wife.

297
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:47.340
Okay.
Give me 50 rupees.

298
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49.470
He is going to Moradabad.

299
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:43.810
[phone ringing]

300
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47.310
Yes.
Yes, Priyanka.

301
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49.890
Nand.
Where are you?

302
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:51.340
You didn't come for tuitions.

303
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:54.390
I had come to Delhi
for some work.

304
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:57.980
Delhi?
Okay.

305
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59.360
Are you done with your work?

306
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01.960
No. No, that...

307
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:05.350
- I was thinking that...
- You will keep thinking forever.

308
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07.620
Do something if you want to
or else forget it.

309
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10.880
[Priyanka] 'Nand.
Are you listening to me?'

310
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16.200
Okay, Priyanka. Thanks.

311
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18.110
[Nand] 'Okay, bye.
I'll see you tomorrow.'

312
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34.520
Hey, you are...

313
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36.290
Yes, sir.
I'm Shanu ma'am's student.

314
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37.810
Yes.

315
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40.430
- How is your tuition going on?
- Very good, sir.

316
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:46.640
So, sir... Is everything alright?

317
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48.660
Yes. Everything is good.

318
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56.240
How is Shanu ma'am?

319
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58.290
Shanu ma'am.
How is she?

320
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00.130
You should be knowing that.

321
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:04.160
I mean, I stay out
for work mostly.

322
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:07.380
And Shanu ma'am spends
most of the time in school.

323
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:08.520
So, you should be knowing.

324
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12.870
Sir, as you stay out most
of the times for work.

325
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14.650
So, Shanu ma'am might get bored
staying alone?

326
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:19.730
No. She has a hobby
of reading.

327
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:22.350
So she keeps herself busy
by reading.

328
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33.410
What happened?

329
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36.720
- You are so naive, sir.
- Why?

330
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39.490
Sir, while you are busy
selling mobile phones

331
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43.010
your wife is inserting
new sim cards daily(!)

332
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45.890
Yes, sir.
I'm telling you the truth.

333
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48.030
Men are going to your house...

334
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49.780
...and women are spying
outside your house.

335
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53.130
Sir, it's not too late.

336
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:57.400
You should control your wife or else...

337
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01.150
I spoke too much. 

338
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:04.300
Now, I am going to get beaten up. 

339
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:10.950
B***h!
She has come here too!

340
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15.040
She?
Who is she, sir?

341
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16.550
She made us leave one city.

342
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20.420
- But she didn't leave my Shanu.
- Who, sir?

343
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:24.900
The woman who you saw
with men is not my Shanu.

344
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28.060
- Who is she then, sir?
- She's a ghost.

345
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:29.960
A witch.

346
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32.780
She is a prostitute from Lucknow.
Her name is Rasbhari.

347
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34.030
Her spirit.

348
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36.360
My Shanu is not at fault.

349
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39.250
That b***h Rasbhari keeps doing
what she wants to.

350
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41.720
My Shanu doesn't even know.

351
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44.390
