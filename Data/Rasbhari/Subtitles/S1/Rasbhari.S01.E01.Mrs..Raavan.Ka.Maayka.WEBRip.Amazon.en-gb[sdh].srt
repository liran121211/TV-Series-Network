1
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:03.780
Meerut.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06.690
Tell me, Nand from Meerut.

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08.440
What's so special about that place?

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:13.110
Dude, I myself am special.

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15.080
Really?

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17.730
Have you done anything special
in Meerut?

7
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:20.480
No, I haven't.

8
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24.110
But something special
happened to me over there.

9
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25.900
Care to know
what happened in Meerut?

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30.040
This story is about
Meerut and me. 

11
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33.790
So, let me begin the story
from my house. 

12
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39.570
Mother of Nand...

13
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42.120
...your superstition has no limits.

14
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44.670
Doing this every morning...

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47.700
...has not prevented any
untoward events from happening.

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50.320
We live in a dangerous city.

17
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54.820
You sell lingerie for a living.

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58.100
What if a school girl
or a college-going bombshell...

19
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00.160
...or any other lady
bewitch you with her beauty?

20
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02.740
We've been married
for 17 years now.

21
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06.410
If I could have been bewitched,
I would have by now.

22
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09.620
You've no idea
what sort of a city this is.

23
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11.180
It's Meerut.

24
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14.180
Meerut. 

25
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16.800
Like every other small city... 

26
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:19.900
...Meerut too, is very laid-back. 

27
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29.570
Guruji, greetings.

28
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30.870
How was your journey?

29
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32.820
Son, may you live long.

30
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35.210
Guruji, did you find a solution?

31
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36.390
Did I find a solution?

32
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38.950
Of course I did!

33
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41.290
I picked a black crow
from a burial ground...

34
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43.790
...and rubbed the hair from
a black dog's tail on its beak...

35
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45.650
...to prepare this powder.

36
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47.040
Take it.

37
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50.760
Mix this in a cold drink and offer
it to the woman of your choice.

38
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53.540
Then within three days...

39
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55.120
...that woman will...

40
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58.540
...completely surrender herself
to you.

41
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01.610
Guruji, I feel blessed!

42
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04.120
But the men from Meerut... 

43
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06.320
...get a kick
out of only one thing. 

44
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14.850
Scoundrels!

45
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17.990
The Delhi intercity train
isn't a girl from your class...

46
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19.620
That you can ride on
whenever you want

47
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20.610
Hold on, sir.

48
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23.040
This is my ear,
not your wife's skirt...

49
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23.930
...that you can tug it
whenever you want

50
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24.710
You...

51
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27.900
Their minds and eyes can be
distracted by only one thing. 

52
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35.150
And only one thing
can blow their minds away. 

53
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42.690
Now that thing
had arrived in Meerut. 

54
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47.600
the women of Meerut are cursed... 

55
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:51.140
...that their house will be ruined
by another woman. 

56
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11.290
- You shouldn't have done that.
- Shut up.

57
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13.530
When Vipul said
"I love you" to you...

58
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16.340
- ...you ran off!
- Yes, but Nand is a good boy.

59
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20.080
Tell me, why would someone
wear a designer panty...

60
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21.610
...if they didn't intend
to show it?

61
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24.670
I swear, my pen was on the floor.

62
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27.040
When I went under the table
to pick it up...

63
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30.460
...I spotted it.

64
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33.050
- And then?
- Then what?

65
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35.750
After taking a good look at Mickey,
I got up...

66
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38.210
...only to find her staring at me.

67
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40.960
I was too shy to look at her.

68
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43.120
We don't get to see that every day!

69
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49.450
But Priyanka saw the whole thing...

70
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52.350
...and she ran to the Principal
to complain.

71
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:55.890
I told the Principal
that Nand has crossed the line.

72
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57.830
Priyanka, you're so mean.

73
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59.960
He took admission in our school
for your sake.

74
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01.000
Nonsense!

75
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03.260
He was in an all-boys school
before.

76
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05.880
Since he was desperate for girls,
he joined ours.

77
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09.000
I'm sure he must have hit on
a thousand girls before me.

78
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12.750
You don't have
a girlfriend, Nand

79
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15.270
I don't believe that.

80
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18.240
Your dad owns a lingerie shop.

81
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:22.380
A lot of beautiful, young girls
must be visiting it every day.

82
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23.960
Yes, but that doesn't mean...

83
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26.750
...I get to take
their measurements.

84
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:29.380
Forget it. Priyanka
is like your sister, right?

85
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32.010
Yes, she was.

86
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35.170
To get close
to her friend, Rupali...

87
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37.960
...I let her tie rakhi on my wrist,
three years in a row.

88
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40.130
And also gifted her
a "Dear Sister" card.

89
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41.350
That too bought from Archies.

90
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43.850
But Rupali fell for
a 12th grade student...

91
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45.540
...and I got stuck
as Priyanka's brother

92
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47.490
Stop laughing!

93
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52.160
Look at him, must be bragging
about the skirt episode.

94
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56.550
What's so funny?

95
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59.430
All the love stories
at high school...

96
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:02.010
...begins by tying a rakhi,
followed by a fight, and then...

97
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06.260
I know he's a pervert.

98
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07.930
Vipul, mark my words.

99
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10.950
If I fail to have sex
before I complete my 12th grade...

100
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13.070
...I'll stay a virgin forever.

101
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14.610
If you fail to do it...

102
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:17.100
...get "Loser" tattooed
on your forehead

103
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18.970
When you can't help me get laid...

104
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21.150
...at least stop f*****g with me.
Get lost!

105
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23.310
Let's go from here.

106
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24.510
'Okay.'

107
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34.970
Hey, why did you do that for?

108
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42.090
Nand, is it true?

109
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:45.930
Of course not, I didn't peep
into her skirt deliberately.

110
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47.260
I'm not talking about that.

111
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49.270
I'm talking about the fact
that you want to do it.

112
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50.680
Do you really want to get laid?

113
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52.830
Yes, I'm quite serious about it...

114
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54.990
...but I've run out of ideas
and hope.

115
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:58.730
- What if I help you out?
- Ask me anything you want.

116
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:00.350
- One thousand rupees.
- What!

117
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02.560
Don't take it so seriously.

118
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04.600
I can do it for 100 rupees
in Delhi.

119
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07.000
What if you contract a disease
or something?

120
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10.280
I'll pay you Rs. 300.
Arrange for it.

121
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16.590
You will be in heaven!

122
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22.830
If you turn right
after the old market... 

123
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23.860
...you'll find a house. 

124
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28.100
A woman lives there. 

125
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32.600
She's extremely gorgeous. 

126
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:36.170
But I've heard
that she doesn't speak much. 

127
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:28.030
'Hello. Yes.'

128
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31.740
Don't you know, I can't answer
my phone when I'm working?

129
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32.710
She is he!

130
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35.940
- I told you not to call me...
- 'B*******d!'

131
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41.490
Tell me what is it quickly.

132
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46.520
H*******e... Ram Khilawan!

133
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:50.710
Why didn't you tell me that the path
to heaven goes through the legs of hell?

134
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53.420
I can't wait to see you tomorrow.

135
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55.310
I'll teach you a lesson.

136
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03.570
Here.

137
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05.070
Give it here.

138
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07.310
Take it.

139
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12.480
Uh-oh, I'm folding my cards.

140
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17.820
Well, as you all know,
we are done with Navratri. 

141
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20.120
Now let's plan for Karva Chauth
for our husbands.

142
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21.800
There is no scope
for Karva Chauth in Meerut.

143
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25.140
Even Mandodari performed this ritual
for her husband King Ravan...

144
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27.330
...but he went after Sita.

145
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29.970
It was Mandodari's mistake!

146
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32.080
She failed to satisfy King Ravan.

147
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34.950
Really, Pushpa?

148
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36.410
When the husband is a monster...

149
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38.370
...how can the wife satisfy him?

150
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42.840
Four or five years
into the marriage...

151
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45.500
...we wives cease to be attractive.

152
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48.960
That's why husbands go hunting...

153
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50.650
...for a new partner.

154
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53.070
What say, Sushma?

155
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55.150
You seem lost in thoughts.

156
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58.750
Your husband is not
sleeping with you or what?

157
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10.150
- Sushma!
- Coming.

158
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:14.280
My limbs are cramped
because of the daily chores!

159
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17.150
Come on, massage my body.

160
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:28.590
What about you, Sneh?

161
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:33.150
Does your husband
'massage' you in the morning?

162
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41.960
- Dear, get the cold drinks.
- 'I'm on my way.'

163
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:45.150
I have made a cold drink for her.

164
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46.660
A special drink!

165
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57.110
Keep an eye on your husband.

166
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:01.520
Now you eat only bland, tasteless food
while fasting for your husbands.

167
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03.700
Next year, you won't even
get to eat that.

168
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05.270
What do you advise us to do?

169
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07.690
Put some make-up on your face.

170
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12.980
Leave one of your
blouse buttons open. 

171
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15.000
You won't die of pneumonia 

172
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:19.870
Go to Pinky Parlour
and get a facial, you fools. 

173
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23.190
If you can't take good care
of yourselves... 

174
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:24.890
...some other woman
will take your husband... 

175
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29.370
- Are you crazy?
- Listen! Calm down!

176
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31.570
Calm down, students.

177
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38.440
Ma'am, you can come in now.

178
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44.510
As the saying goes... 

179
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:48.490
"The clouds won't shower down..." 

180
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51.080
"...until the land goes bone dry." 

181
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54.680
My adolescence
was in a similar condition. 

182
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:59.970
But it showered
before the famine could hit me. 

183
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:05.230
She's Mrs. Shanu Bansal.

184
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:10.280
I know how good is your English.

185
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:13.160
It's quite poor.

186
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15.060
Therefore, from now on...

187
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17.550
...she will teach you
English grammar.

188
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20.140
Greet her!

189
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22.320
Hello, ma'am.

190
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26.490
Ma'am, they are all yours.

191
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:37.930
Hello, 11-C.

192
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40.530
Now you know my name.

193
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:44.000
But let me introduce myself,
properly.

194
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46.280
'I'm not like your other teachers.'

195
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48.900
One instance of stupidity...

196
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51.110
...and you'll fail in this class.

197
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53.670
And the most important thing...

198
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:57.560
As long as we are in school,
we'll talk to each other only in...

199
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59.560
...English.

200
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01.530
Understood?

201
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04.640
Are you deaf?

202
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06.470
Is that clear?

203
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08.600
- Yes, ma'am.
- Good.

204
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10.850
'Chapter one.'

205
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15.620
Though it's not mandatory... 

206
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17.330
...for a breeze
to accompany showers... 

207
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22.350
...but the rainfall will definitely
make you wet. 

208
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33.560
Why are you staring at her?

209
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:37.170
You've to talk to her first,
in that case.

210
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40.310
Unfortunately,
she speaks only English.

211
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45.210
I don't want her to tie me a rakhi.

212
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:49.320
I want her to be the mother
of my children.

213
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51.770
Just wait and watch.

214
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03.000
Yes, I was hitting on Shanu Ma'am.

215
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04.780
But...

216
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38.710
Nand,
what brings you here?

217
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:43.340
I came here casually.
How are you doing?

218
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:46.490
I'm doing great. Shall I make
a sweet paan for you?

219
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50.180
If you promise
that you won't tell my dad...

220
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51.480
...I'll buy a cigarette.

221
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52.970
Nand...

222
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55.950
...no good has ever come out of
ratting on people.

223
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58.100
Take it.

224
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01.540
- Pandit ji.
- 'Yes?'

225
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:03.910
- Who is...
- They are new to the city.

226
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06.380
'A married couple
from Hapur.'

227
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08.460
You know the
brick factory owner, right?

228
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09.960
They are renting his place.

229
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14.460
- And what about her...
- Her husband?

230
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:19.630
Her husband
is a mobile phone salesman.

231
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:22.920
He's usually out of town
for about three days a week.

232
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:30.230
Nand, you can't see much from here.

233
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32.310
- Pandit ji...
- Yes?

234
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35.550
Whom should I see,
and from where...

235
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38.320
Leave that to me.

236
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01.930
Hi, I'm the cable guy.

237
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03.910
'My name's Pappu Tiwari.'

238
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06.400
Here, take my card.

239
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09.800
Call me if there's a problem
with the connection.

240
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:11.630
Is it fine now?

241
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:14.010
- Or should I check?
- Yes, please.

242
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:15.950
And I'm thinking... 

243
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18.360
"Pappu, take care". 

244
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:20.560
Shanu ma'am will outsmart you
with her English. 

245
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:29.940
I managed to get inside the house,
but what next?

246
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32.930
Oh, she's as cold as ice!

247
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39.180
I'll hang up now.
I think she's coming.

248
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:04.710
Well... The connection... should
be set up in h-half an hour.

249
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:07.760
A-And thank you very much...

250
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:09.840
...for the glass of water.

251
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:12.370
Ma'am.

252
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33.410
Call your mother ma'am,
I'm Rasbhari!

253
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:24.710
I swear on God.
I have developed a new weakness.

254
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26.820
It pains a lot, over here.

255
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:30.020
So far, I have slept
with around 82 girls.

256
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34.190
But the kind of workout
this teacher gave me...

257
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:37.720
...was out of this world!

258
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:40.490
Pappu bro, I'm not following you.

259
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:44.870
Are you complaining or bragging...

260
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46.900
...or should I be worried for you?

261
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48.960
Hey, cut it out.

262
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51.590
And listen to this carefully.

263
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53.900
Do you know Sirohi's house?

264
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56.100
- The one opposite Pandit's shop?
- Exactly.

265
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58.490
A beautiful, hot woman
has moved into that house.

266
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:02.760
She really made me
work my ass off.

267
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03.810
Don't ask me, man.

268
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06.840
Why? Did she take you
for a ride or something?

269
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10.610
You're wrong.
You're absolutely wrong.

270
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:14.480
I walked right into her bedroom.

271
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15.750
She agreed instantly!

272
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:17.900
And then I ended up doing
what I do best.

273
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:21.970
Pappu bro, tell me
how do I impress her.

274
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25.400
Don't forget to smile at her
when she looks at you...

275
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27.520
...everything will be smooth
sailing from there.

276
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29.410
Do you understand?

277
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36.050
What were you staring at yesterday?

278
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:38.210
You know it.

279
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:45.670
So, shall I show it
to you myself, today?

280
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:47.960
What is happening here?

281
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:50.220
What is happening?

282
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54.850
- Ma'am, well...
- English.

283
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:01.400
- Just 'Esehi'.
- I said, 'English, please.'

284
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:05.670
If you cannot talk in English,
please leave the class.

285
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:18.980
What was happening?

286
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22.390
Sex.

287
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27.130
No.

288
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:33.420
That will happen now.

289
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48.370
Nand, listen.

290
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50.300
Nand.

291
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:56.210
Couldn't you wait for 30 seconds?

292
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:58.610
You're beating your meat here!
We're getting late for the class.

293
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00.940
- Damn you.
- Don't touch me.

294
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:08.650
Whoever comes late to the class
will be sent out.

295
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13.700
Nonsense. Why are you sleeping?

296
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15.690
Whose skirt did you
peep into this time?

297
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20.510
- Why are you not in the classroom?
- I had been to the loo.

298
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24.830
- Are you done?
- Why? You wanted to come along?

299
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27.940
Priyanka, I'm sorry.

300
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30.440
There's no sense left in you.

301
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32.640
I thought you were
my Rakhi brother.

302
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35.620
But you turned out
to be a pervert.

303
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37.280
Priyanka, to be honest
I did not peek...

304
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40.400
...under the table on purpose.
My pen actually fell down.

305
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42.730
I swear on God.

306
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:24.180
You made her your sister again
by shelling out 15 bucks.

307
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:26.160
Dude, I'm her friend now.

308
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:29.070
I'm not going to be
anyone's brother anymore.

309
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32.670
So, you want to sleep with Priyanka
before your 12th grade.

310
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:36.320
He is the one who pulls
the strings.

311
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:38.390
I'm just here doing his bidding!

312
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40.570
Dude, even you know about
Shanu ma'am, don't you?

313
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:42.950
What do you mean?
Who else knows about her?

314
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:45.420
- Well...
- Guys, come with me. Right now.

315
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46.490
Tomar, what's the matter?

316
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:49.360
- Ms. Shanu is giving Jitu an earful.
- S**********r. Let's go.

317
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:50.300
How dare!

318
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53.410
He misbehaved with me
in the staff room.

319
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55.080
Shanu ma'am, please keep it low.

320
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56.520
It's lunch hour.
Children are around...

321
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57.580
...please try to understand.

322
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59.320
Sir, what do you mean,
keep it low?

323
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:01.690
I'm going to the police
and filing a complaint against him.

324
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03.090
This is unacceptable.

325
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05.040
He doesn't deserve to be a teacher.
What will his students learn!

326
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07.100
Well, at least tell me
what did he do.

327
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08.760
Sir, I was checking the test papers
in the staff room.

328
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11.370
He was staring at me
but I ignored him.

329
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12.730
And then he walked
up to me and said...

330
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14.520
Will you tell him...

331
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17.150
...or shall I say it
and wash my mouth later?

332
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:21.180
Sir, he said, "I think your blouse
is tight, if you don't mind..."

333
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22.620
"...I'll take the measurement
and get a new one stitched for you."

334
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24.790
- Let me take your measurement!
- Mr. Jitender, what's all this?

335
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26.820
S-Sir, I didn't say any such thing.

336
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28.660
What? You didn't say anything?

337
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:31.210
Sir, I'm going to report this
to the police.

338
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32.440
Please don't go to the police.

339
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33.910
It will cause
unnecessary embarrassment...

340
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36.690
...to him, to me
and to you as well.

341
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39.520
You take him to my room
and reprimand him.

342
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:43.540
Look, he's ashamed.

343
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48.030
Sir, he said this to me
in front of everybody.

344
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58.010
S**********r!

345
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02.110
No one will dare to mess
with Shanu ma'am now.

346
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07.630
She defiled Mr. Jitu's face.

347
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09.660
I can't believe Mr. Jitu
said that to her.

348
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:11.830
I thought that s**********r
is a coward.

349
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:15.330
Pappu was cooking up stories
and Jitu bought it, you know.

350
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17.110
It's not that easy, man.

351
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:21.860
Oh, man.

352
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:24.630
Where did you shoplift this from?

353
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26.480
I stole 200 bucks from
my dad's pocket...

354
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:27.560
...let's drink Haywards 5000 today.

355
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:29.670
You're a bloody b*****d.

356
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:36.880
God damn it. Who's calling me now?

357
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39.850
- I'm f****d.
- What happened?

358
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:42.410
I have to take mom somewhere.
I need to go home now.

359
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44.040
No problem.
I'll have both the bottles.

360
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:45.180
Really?

361
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:48.350
- Go ahead. Drink now.
- Hey...

362
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51.810
Get out of here. You think
I'm not going to drink it?

363
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:54.420
- Enjoy.
- I will. Get lost.

364
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56.120
D******k.

365
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:03.450
Mom, I'm getting late
for my tuition.

366
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:06.540
Don't worry, you will be on time.
Let me give your dad his medicine.

367
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:09.240
He's inside.

368
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:21.570
What are you doing here?

369
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24.190
Hi.

370
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26.660
I was just...

371
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:33.230
Don't you think you're obsessed
with female undergarments?

372
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:36.710
- No, I came here with my mom.
- Mom?

373
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39.900
You brought your mom
with you to shop for this?

374
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:44.550
No, my mom's not shopping.

375
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46.380
She came here to meet my dad.

376
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:48.620
So your dad is shopping with her
for undergarments?

377
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:53.400
Priyanka, my dad owns this store.

378
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:54.850
Really?

379
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59.900
- Why didn't you tell me before?
- Well, you know...

380
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:03.880
Next time, I want a discount.

381
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:12.570
Let's go. Hurry up.
The Guruji is here for only two days.

382
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15.130
Don't make me slap you now.

383
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:17.340
You don't like
taking me around, do you?

384
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:22.230
- I am late.
- I'm leaving.

385
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:25.760
Five minutes. Just five minutes.

386
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:27.510
Okay? Come on.

387
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36.300
- Am I late, Sushma?
- No, not at all.

388
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39.420
I have picked a number for you.
He will be here any minute now.

389
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43.300
Well, I went to give
my husband his medicines.

390
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45.790
- Well, did you hear about her?
- Who?

391
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:49.060
- Sirohi's new tenant.
- What about her?

392
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:51.260
A married couple have moved
into that house.

393
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:52.690
No surprise there.

394
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55.420
Ms. Sirohi always
rents it out to a family.

395
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:57.500
- Hear me out.
- Go ahead.

396
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:01.230
A married couple has moved in...

397
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02.850
...and the wife is quite sexy.

398
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06.220
So what? What's the big deal?

399
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08.140
There are so many sexy
women out there.

400
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10.430
Have you seen my niece?

401
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:14.070
She looks just like Katrina
that too without make-up.

402
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17.310
Stop interrupting me now!

403
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21.190
Come on, let her talk.

404
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:23.050
Go ahead.
Tell us what happened.

405
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:24.920
She's utterly sexy.

406
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27.080
All the men in the town
are going...

407
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29.300
...around her house
as if it's a shrine.

408
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:32.710
Sneh's husband
is in the police force...

409
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34.470
...and the police station
is near to her place.

410
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37.440
Do you still think
it's not a big deal?

411
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:43.260
What do you know
about her husband?

412
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46.940
I heard that her husband...
- Long live the Lord...

413
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:50.080
Hail the sage...
- Long live the Lord...

414
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:53.440
All hail...
- The Lord...

415
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:13.380
Hello. Tell me.

416
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:14.870
Mom, what should I get?

417
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17.070
Six Lachha Parathas 

418
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:20.560
- Four Lachha Parathas...
- It's six.

419
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:24.430
- Go on.
- And...

420
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:26.020
Two Dal Fry.

421
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28.240
- One Dal Fry.
- No, two.

422
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29.410
What are you doing?

423
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:32.470
Let me talk. I'm on the phone.

424
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:34.660
Mom, tell me the full list.

425
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36.710
The guy here is getting mad at me.

426
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:40.610
There's an order
from Sirohi Villa.

427
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:43.040
Four Lachha Parathasand one Dal Fry.

428
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44.530
Sir, I'll deliver it.

429
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46.330
Sir, he had gone yesterday.
Today's my turn.

430
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:49.800
- Sir, let me go.
- Sir, I'll go. - Shut up!

431
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:51.840
Where is this enthusiasm...

432
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53.710
..when I ask you guys
to do the dishes!

433
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58.090
- Yeah. Tell me.
- Hey, Manoj.

434
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00.920
I'm taking my order home...

435
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:02.650
...Sirohi Villa is on the way.

436
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:05.140
I'll deliver it,
if you don't mind.

437
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07.500
Pack both the orders now.

438
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:11.730
I was waiting for a chance to see
what Shanu ma'am's husband was about. 

439
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16.040
I didn't know that opportunity
would come knocking at my door. 

440
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:26.550
Yes.

441
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:30.110
Sir, you had placed an order
for food, at Do Bhai.

442
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31.220
Yes.

443
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:32.730
Naveen, who's at the door?

444
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:36.090
Shanu, a delivery boy
from the dhaba.

445
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38.280
How much is the bill?

446
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41.070
Well, it's 320 rupees...

447
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:42.300
...but I'm not a delivery boy.

448
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44.650
- Who are you then?
- I'm Shanu ma'am's student.

449
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:47.290
Listen, it's your student.

450
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:51.990
- Hi, ma'am.
- Hello.

451
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57.650
Were you saying something?

452
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:00.090
Actually, I was going home
with my order...

453
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01.980
...I thought of dropping off
yours as well.

454
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:05.090
Okay. I think
something's missing.

455
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:07.450
Perhaps, it's in my takeaway.

456
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09.080
Why don't you check?

457
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12.420
Give me a minute. Darling...

458
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:46.530
Here's 320 rupees.

459
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48.500
- Thanks, sir.
- Good night.

460
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:51.790
Hi, Vipul.

461
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:56.970
Pappu was making
d*******s out of us.

462
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01.900
Shanu ma'am and her husband
love each other very much.

463
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:05.990
I just saw it.

464
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10.900
I'll see you tomorrow
and will explain it in detail.

465
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:19.210
S**********r!

466
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:22.700
Aunty, is that you?

467
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25.850
Sorry, I shouldn't
have said that.

468
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:28.870
No problem, dear.
I have heard that word before.

469
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:33.120
But, aunty, what are you doing
here at this hour?

470
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35.590
Stop questioning me
and turn around.

471
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:39.200
- Aunty, I have to go this way.
- What did I tell you, dear?

472
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40.760
Turn around and go.

473
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:49.910
On one side Shanu ma'am and
her husband's love was brewing. 

474
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52.110
But women in Meerut... 

475
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:56.180
...were resorting to black magic
to ward her off. 

476
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06.820
Although a lemon looks cute... 

477
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:10.380
...once the juice is swallowed
it hits the stomach like acid. 

478
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12.790
I was under the impression... 

479
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15.290
...that Shanu ma'am and her
husband are in deep love. 

480
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:18.430
But there were rumours
spreading in Meerut. 

481
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20.560
Mr. Sharma who works
in Meerut Bank.

482
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:23.410
Rahul, a B.Tech student
and Snehlata aunty's husband.

483
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25.060
She has slept with
these three men.

484
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26.320
What are you talking about?

485
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:28.560
Ma'am, your account
has been opened.

486
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30.350
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

487
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:40.720
Mr. Sharma who works in Meerut Bank
scored a homerun last night.

488
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:43.500
- Really?
- Yes.

489
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46.120
Who told you?

490
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48.260
Mr. Sharma himself said
this to Bhatia.

491
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53.810
Rahul, a B.Tech student
takes tuitions from my husband.

492
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56.620
I have fixed the mixer, ma'am.

493
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:00.250
He told me that he went
to fix the mixer.

494
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04.930
"These pretty eyes of yours" 

495
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:08.380
"Set my heart racing" 

496
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:12.500
"It's black magic" 

497
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14.420
- And?
- What else?

498
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:18.560
My husband went to pandit's shop.
Normally he doesn't smoke...

499
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:22.830
...but I sent him forcibly to spy.
He said...

500
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:25.110
"The inspector
assigned me this job."

501
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:30.000
Officer, there's no need
to take off your uniform.

502
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31.670
The uniform turns me on!

503
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34.600
Ms. Snehlata was nearby...

504
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36.620
...when her husband stepped
out of Ms. Shanu's home.

505
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37.860
And he was not in the uniform.

506
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:44.240
Hey, what are you doing here?
I went with your lunchbox...

507
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46.780
What happened to your uniform?

508
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:49.220
- They took it.
- Who took it?

509
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51.190
The laundry guy.

510
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:54.120
My shirt was stained with tea.
He'll return after washing it clean.

511
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57.220
Why are you still standing here?

512
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:59.320
Come on, go.
I have to go to the station.

513
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:10.700
Did she catch him in the act?

514
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:13.100
Dude, if she had caught
him red-handed...

515
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15.680
...she would have spread the news
in the entire neighbourhood.

516
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17.470
And she would have kicked
the shit out of her husband.

517
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:21.180
- Looks are really deceptive.
- You're right.

518
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:24.730
Ma'am...
