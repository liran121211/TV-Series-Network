1
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05.430
Really, ma'am.
We are so lucky.

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08.170
Your daughter came into the family
as our daughter-in-law.

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:09.850
Stop it, ma'am.

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12.460
She has inculcated the ethics
of both the families.

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16.420
Let's see how our daughter-in-law
turns out to be.

6
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:21.060
Hey! Why, Mom?
Shardul selected the girl, right?

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23.530
You even met her.

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27.600
Yes. I've met her
and I also know her.

9
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30.450
Thank you.

10
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36.660
Mom.

11
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39.880
Why were you talking about your
daughter-in-law in front of everyone?

12
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41.760
She works in a call centre.

13
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44.720
- She goes to work
wearing short dresses. - So?

14
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47.870
Who knows what she does
after leaving the house!

15
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50.520
Shardul keeps going to Bangkok
due to his work.

16
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:51.710
Who knows what he does there?

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53.650
He is a boy.
He is allowed to do anything.

18
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:56.630
Well, that's how men are.

19
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58.810
Unless they get to relish
the outside food...

20
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00.370
...they can't digest
the homemade food(!)

21
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03.880
Even your Naveen stays out
due to work.

22
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05.330
Doesn't he do anything?

23
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06.960
Keep it in the fridge.

24
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15.340
[Title Montage]

25
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22.380
Yes. Everybody does it.

26
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23.580
What, Ms. Pushpa?

27
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26.190
It's so hot and you
are serving us tea.

28
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27.850
Order for a cold drink.

29
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30.280
Manju, you are bothered
about the cold drink.

30
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33.280
And here the men are having fun
with that whore.

31
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34.520
Sister, are you trying to say...

32
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36.430
...that men don't do anything
after leaving the house?

33
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39.900
Yes... They do
but when they are out of town.

34
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41.680
Whenever my husband
goes to Delhi...

35
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43.080
...he gets a massage done.

36
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46.950
As if I don't know where the girl
touches him while giving the massage!

37
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48.420
That's fine.

38
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52.830
But over here, in our town,
under our noses...

39
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55.380
...someone else is giving
pleasure to our husbands!

40
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56.850
I can't tolerate that.

41
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58.100
What is the use?

42
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00.100
We even tried spying on her.

43
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03.730
- But we couldn't catch hold
of anyone. - Just once...

44
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06.050
Once we catch hold of someone...

45
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08.590
...I swear on Goddess Chandi...

46
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13.280
...I will drag that teacher
out of her house by her hair.

47
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16.200
Why, Ms. Pushpa?
Is your husband on the list too?

48
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19.220
[Manju] 'Oh, okay...'

49
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21.840
Nand is taking tuitions
from her, right?

50
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:25.010
Why?
Did she teach him something too?

51
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35.260
Nand you've already apologised
a hundred times.

52
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36.680
There is no need for all this.

53
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38.450
Yes, ma'am I know.

54
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40.700
But this is not a sorry.

55
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42.360
This is a thank you.

56
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46.850
-What is this?
-Soan papdi. 

57
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51.950
Well, thank you.

58
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55.150
-Can I give you a tip?
-Hmm?

59
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59.310
The next time you gift someone,
know their tastes and likes.

60
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01.080
Don't you like Soan papdi?

61
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03.560
Who doesn't like it?

62
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05.290
That's called assumption, Nand.

63
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08.060
And assumptions do no good.

64
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12.690
So, d********r. What
are you learning these days?

65
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14.590
Tell me.

66
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15.760
What should I say, d*****d?

67
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17.120
Did you measure?

68
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18.720
You dumbfuck,
I go there to study.

69
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22.070
Yes. Hero Nand
has turned back to brother Nand.

70
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23.650
Idiot, you were saying...

71
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25.590
...that you'll make Shanu ma'am
the mother of your future children.

72
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28.680
What happened?
Did you make her your sister?

73
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30.280
Listen to me.

74
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32.880
Let me do her if you're
not getting any.

75
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35.060
Rupali is taken anyway.

76
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37.640
And nobody else cares about me.

77
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40.520
Buddy, I am fine with anything.

78
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42.950
And when the girl is elder to me...

79
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44.980
...I love it.

80
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46.880
Bhalla.

81
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48.390
You don't need Nand's recommendation.

82
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51.240
The rate at which Shanu ma'am
is getting laid...

83
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52.640
...you just have to spread
your legs and stand...

84
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54.000
...and your number will
automatically come.

85
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:54.980
You dickhead!

86
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57.110
Do you have an asshole
instead of a mouth...

87
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59.270
...that you shit every time
you use it?

88
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01.390
Dumbfuck, she is your teacher.

89
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03.480
And above anything,
she is a woman.

90
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07.480
Does anyone have something
more to say about a girl?

91
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16.190
Start buying food
from your own money.

92
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:29.610
Okay. Now, a clause is the most
basic unit of grammar...

93
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32.360
...containing a subject and
a predicate that is a verb.

94
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33.660
So, for example...

95
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35.760
..."Nand studied" is a clause.

96
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37.720
There are two types of clauses.

97
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39.040
Independent and depen...

98
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41.060
Nand.

99
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44.720
- Nand.
- Yes, ma'am.

100
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47.620
- What happened?
- No, ma'am. Nothing. Just...

101
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52.350
You had fight with Vipul.

102
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54.160
You know, ma'am?

103
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56.530
You know, students think...

104
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59.400
...that we teachers don't know
what's happening in the school.

105
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00.910
[Shanu] 'But that's not the truth.'

106
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04.120
I know you fought with Vipul
regarding something.

107
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07.580
Is that why you look troubled?

108
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10.320
Yes, ma'am.

109
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13.890
Ma'am, I'm not able to understand
what's happening in my life.

110
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16.960
I don't like what Vipul says.

111
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18.880
I'm not able to concentrate
on studies.

112
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22.100
And now, even Priyanka
is not talking to me.

113
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24.960
Hmm...

114
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32.160
Well, Nand, I think you
are ready for a lesson.

115
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36.560
Mister, stop.

116
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39.520
Okay. I'll see you in
school tomorrow.

117
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:45.050
Okay, listen. Get those tops.
Bye.

118
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56.080
Mister,
is any other system available?

119
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59.000
Priyanka, talk to me for just
five minutes and then I'll leave.

120
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05.370
Tell me.

121
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:09.730
Look, I'm an asshole.
Yes. I'm a stupid.

122
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:13.450
And I don't think before I speak.

123
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17.570
But I know one thing very well.
Honesty.

124
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:22.830
Honesty.

125
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28.450
Honesty is very important
in life and in relations.

126
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:32.070
Do you know there is nothing
more sexy than the truth?

127
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34.120
Huh?

128
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35.210
What happened?

129
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37.980
Can't a teacher use the word "sexy"?

130
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43.570
Look, Priyanka.
I like you a lot.

131
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48.460
And I do have a little feeling
that you too like me a lot.

132
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:50.830
You can use the word little.

133
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53.910
Okay. You do like me a little.

134
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57.200
And I know
that I've hurt you a lot.

135
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00.960
I also ignored you.
And I'm so sorry for that.

136
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04.630
You have already apologised
to me before.

137
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07.490
I am the one who's mad
to forgive you every time.

138
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08.430
Don't forgive me this time.

139
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10.110
Don't forgive me at all.

140
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13.400
But I just want to
tell you one thing.

141
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17.090
Tell me.

142
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18.720
Everyone at this age thinks...

143
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21.700
...to have an affair
is the most important thing.

144
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27.410
But two people having
respect for each other...

145
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29.680
...is more important
than having an affair.

146
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35.610
If you respect,
I don't know about the affair...

147
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38.120
...but there will be
a genuine friendship.

148
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40.120
You'll get a lifelong friend.

149
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47.820
No matter how much we fight...

150
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50.180
...one thing is for sure.

151
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52.940
That is,
I have always respected you...

152
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55.040
...and I'll keep respecting you.

153
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:00.670
Friends?

154
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11.300
Anyway, you carry on.

155
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30.400
[Nand whistling]

156
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42.550
Mom, why are behaving
like a Ninja in the house?

157
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45.240
I haven't seen you whistle like this.

158
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:49.740
Why? Can only your cooker
blow a whistle? Can't I do it?

159
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52.050
- Okay!
- Hmm.

160
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58.320
What are you sniffing?
I don't drink beer.

161
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00.030
Hmm.

162
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01.480
Come, sit.

163
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04.780
Sit down. Sit.

164
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15.440
Tell me.

165
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:17.650
Where were you?

166
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20.400
- Tuitions.
- Which one?

167
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24.980
- English.
- At Shanu ma'am's?

168
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26.710
No...

169
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29.090
There is a tea seller in front
of her house, right?

170
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30.530
Today I had been to him
for tuitions, Mom!

171
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32.420
Stop this nonsense.

172
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:34.570
Are you trying to joke around?

173
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36.720
Mom, you know everything.

174
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38.160
Then why are you enquiring?

175
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42.630
- Enough.
- What?

176
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:45.660
Enough of your tuitions.

177
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48.590
You don't need to go for
English tuitions anymore.

178
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51.720
- Huh?
- What huh?

179
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56.000
Did you forget Hindi
while learning English?

180
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58.320
Don't you get what I am saying?

181
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01.160
- But, Mom.
- Nothing doing.

182
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03.920
Mark my words.

183
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05.560
No more tuitions from tomorrow.

184
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:10.470
- What happened at Nand's house?
- Not at his house, but in the class.

185
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12.290
- Yes.
- You don't hear anything I say.

186
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:16.370
Are you alright?

187
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19.690
Yes, I'm alright.
What will happen to me?

188
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:23.940
No. I mean...
Does Meerut seem fine to you?

189
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:25.950
Yes.

190
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30.280
- And class?
- Classes are going good.

191
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:33.710
I enjoy. The students are good.
They are smart.

192
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:38.420
But you know, my husband
doesn't stay at home much.

193
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41.370
He has a travelling job,
you see.

194
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:45.440
Yes.

195
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:53.500
-'Don't do this, dear.'
- Stay there...

196
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55.640
Stay there. Okay. Now speak.

197
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58.280
Why don't you say something?

198
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59.800
Are you dumb?

199
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03.560
Hey, Nand.
Listen to your mother at once.

200
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05.480
Okay!
Here you go.

201
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06.900
No...

202
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10.020
Your dad will get
whatever you ask for.

203
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11.680
- Do you want a motorcycle?
- What are you saying?

204
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15.250
- Stay quiet! Motorcycle?
- Mom, you know what I want.

205
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18.620
- Tell me if you are ready
to agree or else... - No...

206
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20.430
Okay, fine.

207
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:24.260
- Go to tuitions.
- Are you sure? - Yes.

208
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27.360
- Put the knife away.
- Back...

209
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28.320
Put the knife away.
Put it away.

210
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:40.200
[phone ringing]

211
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42.630
What happened to him
at this hour?

212
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49.030
- Yes, tell me.
- Were you sleeping?

213
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51.040
No, you d****d.
I was playing cricket.

214
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52.520
[Nand] 'Do you want to play?' 

215
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55.160
- Listen, that...
- Are you drinking beer?

216
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:57.890
Yes, buddy.
I went way too far talking shit.

217
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00.180
[Vipul] 'You know that there
is no filter in my mouth.' 

218
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01.990
Whenever I open it, I speak shit.

219
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03.960
So, sorry.

220
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07.350
Even I hit you for no reason.

221
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09.210
[Nand] 'I am sorry too.' 

222
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11.550
And listen.'Apologise to ma'am.' 

223
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14.190
Sure, buddy. Sure.
Anything for you.

224
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16.510
[Vipul] 'I'll apologise to ma'am
first thing in the morning.' 

225
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21.160
There are two more beers.
Will you come?

226
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22.910
No... Dumb-fuck.

227
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25.400
I created a ruckus at home today.

228
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:29.030
My parents will bury me
if I irritate them more.

229
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31.560
Don't get drunk.

230
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35.270
- Okay.-[Nand] 'Good night.' 

231
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39.280
- Mom.
-[Pushpa] 'Yes.'

232
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40.680
Aren't you sleepy?

233
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42.920
Yes, that...

234
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53.670
You are asking me to sleep
after creating a ruckus.

235
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57.410
What's the matter now?

236
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:02.730
Why do you want to go to
Shanu ma'am for tuitions?

237
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06.110
Mom, Shanu ma'am is a good teacher.

238
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10.300
And I'll become something
if I learn from her.

239
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12.100
That is what I'm tensed about.

240
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14.000
Mom.

241
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:15.320
I am your son.

242
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17.900
And I won't do anything wrong.

243
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19.730
I promise.

244
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22.480
- Really?
- Yes, I promise.

245
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26.140
Okay. Go to sleep.

246
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28.610
- You too go to sleep.
- You sleep.

247
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51.280
[Nand] 'Ma'am,
check these clauses once.'

248
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53.180
- Hmm?
- 'Clauses.'

249
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:56.920
Here you go.

250
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:58.490
Ma'am, this...

251
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02.280
Usually it's given while apologising
or thanking someone, right?

252
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04.780
And you'll scold me
when you check my homework.

253
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:10.190
Actually, even I
wanted to thank you.

254
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12.540
Vipul had come today.

255
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15.390
He kept apologising profusely
for a long time.

256
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18.750
- I'll take one more.
- Hmm.

257
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22.100
Can I get a glass of water?

258
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52.500
What is it, kid?

259
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55.140
Are you lost?

260
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01.430
M-Ma'am?

261
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06.020
What is this ma'am?

262
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10.640
I am not a ma'am, dear.

263
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:16.440
I am Rasbhari.
Kiddo.

264
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:20.000
- Dear. - Ma'am.
- My precious.

265
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22.680
It is time for you to be a man,
kiddo.

266
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26.370
Ma'am, today is Tuesday.

267
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30.590
We'll do it tomorrow for sure.
Tomorrow. Okay?

268
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:35.480
No matter if it's a Tuesday
or a Monday, kid...

269
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38.790
...one cannot refuse
rain from falling!

270
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42.360
And I haven't even done
anything yet.

271
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46.560
Ma'am, I can't do this.

272
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:49.730
Do you know whom
you are saying no to, kid?

273
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54.340
I make royals forget their royalty.

274
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57.310
They call me Rasbhari.

275
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:02.030
I will leave you perplexed
once I touch your lips.

276
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05.040

that of jimsonweed.

Victory to the king of Monkeys
who is illuminating three worlds.

279
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12.770
Victory to Hanuman who is the
ocean of wisdom and virtues.

280
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15.320
- Victory to the king of monkeys...
- You're the messenger of Rama.

281
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17.070
You are also called by the names ofAnjani Putra and Pavana Sut.

282
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18.670
Oh mighty valorous one,
of terrific deeds.

283
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20.690
Cure my bad mind, oh companion
of those with pure mind.

284
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24.110
What, kiddo?

285
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:25.970
Will you scare me
with Hanuman Chalisa?

286
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27.050
No...

287
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29.960
- You think I'm a ghost?
- No...

288
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33.040
- No...
- Come on, kiddo.

289
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36.070
Enough of this hide and seek.
Come.

290
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:41.210
Ma'am, I will be a sinner
and you too.

"Why couldn't I do it?
I got to know this later on."

292

"I was still thinking..."

"...when Rasbhari came in front of me
who I was waiting for so long?"

295
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:05.790
"Was I shit scared?"

296
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09.170
"Or was it my respect for ma'am?"

297
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12.330
"Or was it the teachings inculcated
in me by my parents?"

298
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:17.590
"What was the reason that I lost
the chance of losing my virginity?"

299
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20.620
"I was soon going to
get the answer."

[Pushpa] 'Open the door.
It's me.'

Nothing. What?
What's supposed to happen?

00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59.290
Where had you been?

306
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03.250
I had been for tuitions.

307
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08.700
Tuitions?
Where are the books?

308
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10.620
Books. They're outside.

309
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:14.490
No, there are no books.

310
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:19.490
There is the bag and also
the key of the scooter.

311
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21.660
But I couldn't find the books.

312
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24.870
Yes... They're there.
