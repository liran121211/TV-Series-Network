1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02.030
-[Lady 1] You b***h! W***e.
- [Savita] Leave me, sister.

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:03.490
- Leave...
- Sister, leave me...

3
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:05.430
- Leave you? Huh? B***h...
- Please, sister.

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06.990
Why is she beating Savita?

5
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09.440
Savita had an affair with her husband.

6
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11.230
- She caught them.
- Leave you?

7
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13.350
- Sister...
- I won't leave you. You, b***h.

8
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16.380
- I love Naresh...
- Love?

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18.420
- Shut up!
- Naresh ji, please tell her.

10
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20.870
- What can he say?
- Naresh ji, please say something.

11
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22.440
Please tell her, Naresh ji!

12
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24.640
- Sister, leave me!
- I won't spare you!

13
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26.630
Your husband is fed up of you.
So, you trapped my husband.

14
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28.730
- Don't you have any shame?
- Please Sister...

15
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30.140
Why doesn't Naresh ji speak up?

16
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33.050
An affair is never one sided.
There are two people involved.

17
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35.900
That doesn't matter...

18
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38.060
... it is the woman who is shamed.

19
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42.190
- I'll clean the bedroom.
- Hmm.

20
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49.940
[Title Montage]

21
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03.360
Bhalle,
what will you have for lunch now?

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05.000
This is not mine.

23
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06.610
It's someone else's. Want some?

24
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07.900
- No.
- Have it.

25
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:08.840
No man.

26
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:10.750
Let's go. Time for assembly.

27
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13.250
- Oh, no.
- Hey...

28
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14.480
Let me at least finish.

29
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18.750
I won't invite you home
after my marriage.

30
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20.140
Who knows what all you will eat up.

31
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22.160
- Your wife..?
- What! What?

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24.440
- Food! Cooked by your wife, man.
- Really!

33
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26.340
- Hey, Nand.
- Good morning, madam...

34
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27.500
G-Good morning.

35
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29.050
Tuck your shirt.

36
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31.700
You forgot this yesterday.

37
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:40.810
Thanks, madam.

38
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42.790
But, why you left?

39
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45.560
By the time I returned from the
kitchen you had gone. What happened?

40
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50.230
I got an urgent phone call from home.
So, I left.

41
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53.940
Hey, same time today?

42
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:56.490
Okay, madam.

43
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01.750
[Priyanka] 'What are you doing here?'

44
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05.110
- Hi.
- Hi.

45
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07.990
- Hurry, it's time for assembly.
- Let's go.

46
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14.600
So, what else? How are you?

47
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17.700
Everything's great, "Sir".
You tell me?

48
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22.080
What do you expect if you ask
such a boring question?

49
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24.150
"So, what else! How are you!"

50
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29.020
You are definitely funny.

51
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32.440
And... also sweet.

52
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34.720
- Don't lie...
- No, really!

53
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36.940
For real!

54
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40.450
Tell me, how are things with Priyanka?

55
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:41.940
Much better, ma'am.

56
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:45.910
See...

57
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48.030
I told you.

58
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50.920
Truth and respect.

59
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53.610
Yes, ma'am.

60
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59.630
Okay. Let us revise direct
and indirect speech.

61
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:03.430
Because sometimes examiners
expect answers to be in...

62
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05.750
Nand, what happened?

63
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08.590
Is something troubling you?

64
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10.590
No... nothing.

65
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12.490
Okay, so...

66
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15.830
...direct and indirect speech.

67
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18.230
Ma'am, I wanted to ask you something.

68
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19.900
Go on.

69
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23.430
How long did it take you yesterday?

70
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24.620
For what?

71
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27.690
From here till there.

72
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29.820
and then bring the glass
of water back.

73
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41.290
I...

74
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:43.370
That...

75
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:46.670
Why?

76
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48.430
What happened?

77
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50.550
Nothing, ma'am.

78
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52.310
I just asked.

79
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55.290
Okay, so what were you teaching?

80
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57.570
Something about indirect speech.

81
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:04.530
[Nand] 'So I was reading about
multiple personality disorder.' 

82
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:06.840
'What the f**k is it?' 

83
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09.030
'Really, what the f**k is it?' 

84
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12.390
'Is it a ghost, witch or
split personality? What is it?' 

85
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14.660
'I was so clueless.' 

86
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29.650
I knew I would find you here.

87
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32.040
Will you do me a favour?

88
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35.430
What? Do you have a form to be filled?

89
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37.410
No... Wait.

90
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45.600
I have a friend request from this guy.

91
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47.290
Really?

92
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49.270
So what am I supposed to do?

93
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51.420
I want to see his photos.

94
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:55.170
As long as I don't accept his request,
I won't be able to see his photos.

95
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56.780
Do something about it.

96
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02.520
I want to see if
this boy is hot or not.

97
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04.490
Only then will I make him my friend.

98
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05.750
Is that so?

99
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09.150
So, are you my friend
because I am hot.

100
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11.350
Mental...

101
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13.920
Since the day you talked
about 'respect'...

102
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16.240
...you have become my best friend.

103
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19.540
And it doesn't matter how
a best friend looks...

104
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21.080
...he is always a best friend.

105
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23.420
Now do something.

106
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34.140
His hair style is like a pig.

107
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:35.560
It's not like that.

108
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37.640
- This is the current fashion.
- Yeah, right.

109
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39.050
What a fashion(!)

110
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40.320
Check out your hair first.

111
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:42.600
Show.

112
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47.080
[Shanu] 'Correct.'

113
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:48.680
Perfect.

114
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50.360
Perfect.

115
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53.160
Very good, Nand.

116
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56.220
Thank you, ma'am.

117
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:00.470
So, now syllabus is complete.

118
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:02.920
Now all you have to do is...

119
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04.460
...top that English exam.

120
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06.340
Sure, I will.

121
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:07.940
That's yours.

122
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10.950
Actually ma'am,
it is all because of you.

123
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13.160
You are a great teacher.

124
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16.080
You taught me English...

125
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18.180
...as well as that thing
about respect.

126
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23.360
So...

127
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25.500
All is well between you and Priyanka?

128
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32.580
I'll leave, ma'am.

129
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34.960
No tuitions from tomorrow.

130
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37.480
So, I'll see you at school.

131
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44.340
-[Nand] Bye, ma'am.
- Good night.

132
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02.210
[Nand whistling]

133
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:12.950
M-Madam?

134
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:14.520
Y-You?

135
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:19.090
Why, kid?

136
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22.480
When you don't like me at all...

137
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25.860
...why do you keep arriving
at my door?

138
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27.110
Madam, I just...

139
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29.550
...came to take my k-keys.

140
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30.970
And I'm leaving.

141
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32.940
No, kid.

142
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36.320
I won't let you go anywhere today.

143
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38.030
M-Madam...

144
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41.210
I have some w-work, madam.

145
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43.260
M-Madam, today...

146
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44.710
L-Let me go, madam.

147
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49.530
- Ma'am...
- Kid.

148
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53.870
You will have to do something
for me today.

149
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55.720
W-What?

150
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00.130
[moaning]

151
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02.110
Slow down!

152
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05.200
Slowly... you'll kill me!

153
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11.030
Is this ok?

154
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13.070
Ma'am... I mean...

155
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14.870
Rasbhari ji.

156
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16.280
Deadly.

157
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18.940
There's magic in your hands, kid.

158
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23.300
If you are so good
at massaging legs...

159
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25.100
...then the rest would be...

160
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:31.150
Feeling shy, kid?
Huh?

161
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33.470
Tell me something, kid.

162
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36.560
Is there something wrong with me?

163
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:39.940
Do I lack something?

164
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:41.360
No.

165
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43.700
Then why am I unable to allure you?

166
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46.140
If I tell you...

167
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:47.790
...will you stop or...

168
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54.540
I love someone else.

169
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58.580
Oh ho...

170
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03.980
So my prince is a lovebird.

171
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06.450
Can I tell you something, kid?

172
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09.320
Love is nothing.

173
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13.300
Two bodies need a reason to unite.

174
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16.220
Love is an excuse of that.

175
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19.950
From centuries, men and women...

176
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23.420
...use this as a reason
to sleep with each other.

177
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26.850
"I love you..."

178
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29.540
That's it. Isn't it?

179
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33.190
Now, kid...

180
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37.870
The fire that burns
between out thighs...

181
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41.070
...is the reality of our world.

182
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43.950
The rest is a lie.

183
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52.750
Okay tell me...

184
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55.450
...did anything happen
between you and that girl?

185
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58.410
No!?

186
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01.640
Our dear prince seems
good for nothing!

187
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03.550
Why? What did happen?

188
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07.210
I didn't have the guts.

189
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12.310
Tell me the truth, kid.

190
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14.800
You lack guts...

191
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17.500
...or you don't know
what is to be done?

192
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19.290
And then...

193
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21.290
... he sent a message...

194
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23.090
...at 2 in the night.

195
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26.180
I told him rudely...

196
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28.600
...don't message so late at night.

197
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30.420
But to be honest...

198
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32.780
...I enjoyed it.

199
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37.310
Are you listening to me or not?

200
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39.760
Hmm, I'm listening.

201
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:41.720
Then say something.

202
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:42.780
Kid...

203
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:48.520
...a woman would rather peek into
a man's heart than his manhood.

204
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52.130
Whatever you feel...

205
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53.740
...express it.

206
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56.120
If you are sad then express it.

207
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58.720
If you are angry then show your anger.

208
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01.930
If you are upset then show
that you are upset.

209
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05.160
This affects a woman's heart.

210
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07.550
What should I say?

211
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10.470
Tell me, what should I say?

212
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13.610
That I enjoy hearing
about your new affairs?

213
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16.910
Or should I say that I can't sleep
because you are texting someone at night?

214
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19.820
Thinking that you are awake
for someone else.

215
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22.550
I don't want to say anything.

216
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27.040
And listen...

217
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29.120
I'm not like your girlfriends.

218
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:32.100
Share this story with someone
who will be happy to hear it.

219
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04.670
Tell me... why did you call me?

220
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07.620
Sit for two minutes.

221
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11.460
I don't want to sit.
What's the matter?

222
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15.980
Apologise for what you
said this afternoon.

223
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18.600
Forget it. I won't.

224
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24.230
Why are you driving me crazy, Nand?

225
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25.270
I am driving you crazy?

226
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26.550
Yes, you are...

227
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27.380
Really?

228
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28.970
How am I driving you crazy?

229
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31.890
When I showed feelings for you,
you never reacted.

230
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34.450
Look at me. I am speaking to you.

231
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36.420
When I treated you as a loser...

232
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38.160
...you talked about 'respect'
and made me a friend.

233
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39.400
[Nand] 'I was looking at Priyanka.' 

234
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43.890
'And then slowly I understood...' 

235
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45.950
'...why I couldn't do anything
with Rasbhari.' 

236
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:47.760
'Actually...' 

237
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:49.620
'...the reason was Priyanka.' 

238
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:53.490
'When you are this close
to each other...' 

239
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:57.910
'...and your breath
becomes heavy...' 

240
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01.610
'...then there's only
one thing to do.' 

241
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06.730
Sure?

242
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:08.810
Hmm.

243
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47.370
Nandu!

244
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49.690
-[Nand] Yes, Mom?
- Come here, son.

245
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:53.980
Hey, let it be.

246
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55.720
Avoid these gymnastics.

247
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:56.620
Get down.

248
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58.310
- Give me your hand.
- Yes.

249
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59.290
- Okay.
- Come.

250
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:06.420
I have fed you a lot to make you
into this strapping lad.

251
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16.470
So, you should come
to my help on your own.

252
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:19.250
Got it.

253
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23.300
Listen...

254
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:25.430
Yes.

255
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28.230
How was your day?

256
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30.480
As usual.

257
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33.140
Listen, that...

258
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36.550
Where all did you go?

259
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38.560
Where will I go, Mom?

260
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40.990
School, tuition and home.

261
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:45.780
Tuition.

262
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01.170
Sushma.

263
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07.010
I was cooking Khichdi.
And she suddenly called.

264
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07.940
F**k!

265
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10.690
Sushma, you have even kept a maid
to prepare dinner.

266
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12.000
Hey, listen.

267
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13.620
What's so urgent?

268
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15.360
I have decided.

269
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:16.910
- What?
- About...

270
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20.460
...what is to be done
with that w***e teacher.

271
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23.300
- What is to be done?
- We have to throw her out.

272
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25.620
In broad daylight.

273
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28.520
We will go to her house
tomorrow morning...

274
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:31.590
...drag her by her hair and throw her
out...

275
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34.040
... throw her out of the city.

276
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35.820
Now you are talking.

277
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:40.350
We have been waiting for this avatar
of you to awaken.

278
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41.570
It has awakened.

279
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43.400
And I think...

280
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45.150
...we should call Pappu,
the cable guy as well.

281
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46.990
- Huh?
- He will make a video.

282
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49.910
And who knows, this might be
tomorrow's breaking news.

283
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:51.370
And yeah...

284
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54.200

- [Lady 2] Okay. - [Sushma] Yes.

287
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58.050
- Okay then, see you tomorrow.
- [Lady 2] Okay.

288

Come, let's go.

289
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14.050
- Go on.
- Pick up, idiot.

291
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20.400
