1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:02.870
This is the girl, Bhabhi.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06.080
Looks pretty!
What happened?

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08.990
I said no.

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13.610
I am too young to get stuck in a marriage

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:16.550
Really? Are you saying your brother's
life is ruined because he got married!

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20.440
Naveen is lucky.

7
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22.860
Let me know if there
is someone like you.

8
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24.670
- Really!
- And I'll get married right away.

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27.010
What time is my brother Naveen
arriving tomorrow?

10
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28.290
I think in the evening.

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32.440
Here you go.
Eat this pudding.

12
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35.580
I have had enough. Not anymore.
I’ll sleep now.

13
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38.200
- Come on, just try it.
- Not even a bit.

14
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:09.520
[Title Montage]

15
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19.600
But, what happened that night?

16
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23.670
- Huh?
- What happened that night?

17
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:26.650
That...

18
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:29.950
As usual, I reached home
after work.

19
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34.180
Shanu had made carrot pudding.

20
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35.980
I have a cousin, Anup.

21
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38.200
He visited us two days ago.
She had cooked it for him.

22
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41.550
I went to the bathroom
to take a shower.

23
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45.460
And when I came out...

24
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52.050
Shanu...

25
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59.520
Darling, the food is burnt.

26
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:04.170
Shanu.
Hey, the food is burnt.

27
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:07.720
Shanu? Where is she?

28
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09.480
Darling.

29
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:14.730
Shanu. Darling.

30
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:22.310
Shanu?

31
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36.110
- Welcome, my Master. Welcome.
- Shanu?

32
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40.210
Shanu who?

33
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43.320
I'm your dear Rasbhari.

34
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:47.930
Come.
Come here.

35
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53.460
Is this a joke?

36
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57.390
The joke is on me.

37
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01.920
Destiny has played a game
with my life.

38
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04.250
And given me this avatar...

39
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08.760
Now there is a queue of suitors
waiting for me in Lucknow.

40
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:14.230
What are you
talking about, Shanu?

41
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17.640
Sounding rustic?
Am I not?

42
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20.800
Mom made me drop out of school

43
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23.910
And I remained illiterate

44
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27.920
But I know everything about life.

45
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30.800
Give me a chance.

46
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33.820
And I won't disappoint you.

47
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37.450
- Shanu.
- What is it, prince?

48
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40.650
Is this your wife’s name you keep repeating?

49
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42.770
She isn't here.

50
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47.340
The woman in your
arms is, Rasbhari.

51
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50.830
♪Rasbhari♪

52
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58.570
♪Rasbhari♪

53
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05.300
♪Take my heart
Take my life ♪

54
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06.970
♪Take me wherever you want...♪

55
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08.840
[Naveen] Shanu was absolutely normal
the next day.

56
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12.390
As if, whatever happened
last night was my illusion...

57
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13.560
...a dream.

58
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15.030
Did you see Rasbhari after that?

59
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18.020
Yes, a couple of times.

60
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22.210
But Shanu has no memory
of this at all.

61
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26.440
What are you thinking?

62
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31.530
You think she's lying
to me, don't you?

63
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:32.810
That she's taking me
for a ride...

64
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34.140
...and making a fool out of me,
right?

65
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35.360
Yes, sir!

66
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38.010
I have seen this in movies.

67
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39.570
They call it role play.

68
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40.900
To make one’s sex...

69
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45.260
…personal life spiced up

70
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48.420
The man plays the role of a
policeman or a plumber.

71
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50.750
And the woman becomes a nurse
or a teacher.

72
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52.600
And then you get going… and going!

73
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:59.500
You get what I’m trying to say.

74
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04.250
- Sir. Sir.
- Hmm.

75
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07.360
Didn't you ever try to find out?

76
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10.260
Try? I left no stone unturned.

77
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11.360
[Shanu] Naveen.

78
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:13.600
Naveen.

79
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16.680
- How did this shirt tear?
- Huh?

80
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18.860
How did this shirt tear?

81
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22.420
I don't know.

82
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24.120
What do you mean you don't know?

83
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26.670
- But I do.
- What?

84
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:31.340
I had cooked that night,
And you had gone for a shower.

85
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33.640
I had kept
this shirt for you.

86
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35.760
[Shanu] Then how did it tear
overnight?

87
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:40.530
- That...
- That!!

88
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42.860
You just don't care.

89
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45.900
I buy things for you with love
and you ruin them.

90
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48.320
Sunday will pass getting this fixed.

91
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:50.880
Listen.

92
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55.750
Can I get you some flowers
on my way back home?

93
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00.900
No. You know I'm allergic
to flowers, don't you?

94
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02.950
You will get flowers...

95
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05.100
...and I'll be sneezing all night.

96
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07.360
Remember, what happened
during the festival?

97
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11.460
Yes, I thought you're going...

98
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14.620
...to extinguish the holy fire
with your sneezing.

99
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18.270
- I won't get flowers.
- Don't.

100
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:19.940
Go.

101
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24.510
- Do you really want me to go?
- No.

102
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26.430
- Shouldn't I?
- No.

103
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28.550
- Shall I?
- Yes.

104
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30.630
Bye.

105
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:32.580
Bye.

106
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:51.040
[Naveen] 'And then Rasbhari
didn't show up for a long time.'

107
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17.680
'I spent sleepless nights
waiting for Rasbhari.'

108
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:19.850
And then one night.

109
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28.460
What's up, mister?

110
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32.580
Have you fallen in love
with Rasbhari?

111
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:36.100
Today you have landed straight on my bed.

112
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41.180
Now that you are here...

113
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44.930
...why don't you have
a good time...

114
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46.670
...with me?

115
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50.160
I have brought something for you.

116
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01.150
[Naveen] 'Shanu is allergic
to flowers...'

117
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03.470
'...but Rasbhari...'

118
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07.400
Oh my prince. I’m impressed.

119
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14.150
Aren't you going to sneeze?

120
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17.310
It's jasmine, my dear.

121
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:24.400
It doesn't make you sneeze,
it gets you in the mood.

122
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29.360
Naveen, what's this?

123
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32.520
Why did you bring flowers?

124
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36.260
Look at me.

125
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38.540
Get rid of them.

126
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41.090
Yes...
Sorry...

127
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47.690
What?

128
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57.460
Well done. Great.

129
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03.480
A*****e.

130
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:13.230
Bloody f****r.
Sir, you were saying something.

131
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16.310
No not me, it was Shanu.

132
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19.170
She used to tell me,
despite sleeping all night...

133
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21.770
...she felt quite tired.

134
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:26.360
And if she dozes off
during the day...

135
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:29.380
...she wakes up
with an aching body.

136
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34.660
Even I feel this
when I'm alone.

137
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37.520
Well, you know...

138
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41.380
Did you take her to an exorcist?

139
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42.940
Yes, I did that too.

140
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45.020
Who else did you take her to?

141
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51.180
We are next.

142
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:00.050
Shanu, what's wrong?

143
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02.770
Why are you crying?

144
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08.030
I'm losing my mind.

145
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10.000
I'm going mad, right, Naveen?

146
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:11.880
What's happening to me?

147
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15.020
Shanu...

148
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17.460
We are going to consult a doctor.

149
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19.790
You're going to be all right.

150
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21.550
I don't know, Naveen.

151
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24.630
I sleep somewhere
and wake up somewhere else.

152
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27.950
And I can't recall a thing.

153
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:29.920
Shanu...

154
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34.210
...I'm there for you.

155
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:37.920
Don't worry.

156
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43.420
Dissociative Identity Disorder.

157
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44.940
Split personality.

158
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46.860
Huh?

159
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51.080
It means more than one personality
living in a body.

160
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53.650
Sir, this is called being
possessed by an evil spirit

161
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55.750
I did not believe it.

162
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59.530
But when medicines did not help...

163
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00.910
...I had to believe it.

164
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02.440
Hello, Mom.

165
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05.510
Everything is fine.

166
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07.600
Shanu? Shanu is asleep.

167
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12.830
Well, Mom, where is that tantric baba
nowadays?

168
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15.540
No, everything's fine at home.

169
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18.240
It's for one of my friends.

170
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:23.340
He's in trouble.

171
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28.320
Please send the address on Whatsapp

172
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32.530
- You mean, that tantric who chases away ghosts?
- Hmm...

173
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:34.510
Huh?

174
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35.830
Have you ever seen a ghost?

175
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38.480
Yes, I've seen them in movies.

176
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:41.190
- They stand like this.
- I've seen a real one.

177
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49.590
- What happened to the street lights?
- Just a second, sir.

178
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53.130
Sir.
- Hmm.

179
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55.050
Can we discuss this under those lights?

180
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56.540
But let’s get the tickets.

181
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59.150
- We’ll buy them later.
- What has happened?

182
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04.950
Greetings, Baba.

183
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10.000
Baba, we've come here
for help.

184
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12.180
I have got a solution
for every problem.

185
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14.430
Tell me. What's your problem?

186
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17.850
Baba, this is my wife, Shanu.

187
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26.830
Hmm… She's beautiful.

188
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:30.880
- Naveen, let's go.
- Wait. Let me finish.

189
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34.660
Baba, there seems to be
an evil spirit on her.

190
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36.390
No. It's impossible.

191
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38.980
Why? Baba...

192
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:42.950
Because, the moment
an evil spirit enters this place...

193
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44.170
...it will be burnt to ashes.

194
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46.780
- Naveen, let's go, please.
- Have patience.

195
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49.970
Baba, I beg you.

196
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55.500
You're our last hope.
Help us.

197
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56.720
Whom do I save you from?

198
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59.390
There are just three people
in this cottage and all three...

199
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00.590
What's up, Baba?

200
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:07.530
Did you forget about me?
I’m here too.

202
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:14.790
Baba, I know this mantra, too.

203
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:19.090
[chanting mantra]

204
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:20.580
- Shanu.
- Right?

205
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:25.820
Who is this Shanu?
I'm your Rasbhari, prince.

206
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27.330
- Come closer...
- Baba. 

207
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30.200
You witch, leave him alone.

208
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34.660
Come on Baba. I'm not an evil witch
hanging from a tree…

209
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36.190
…whom you get rid of by
waving a broom.

210
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:41.190
I was famous from Garhi to Kolkata...

211
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43.780
...even before the revolt of 1857.

212
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:47.170
I wasn't scared of the Nawabs
or the British not even of my mother

213
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49.810
So who the heck are you?

214
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51.370
- Lets get rid of your ghosts…

215
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54.110
- Baba, mantra. Mantra.
- Let me show you how.

216
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56.150
- She's insane.
- Come, let me chase away the ghost.

217
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57.920
Baba gave up too.

218
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06.100
He said even he couldn’t
help me.

219
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09.340
Then...
Then what happened?

220
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16.820
Only I knew about Shanu’s condition

221
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20.080
Then, gradually...

222
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23.620
...the entire town came to know.

223
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32.350
- Let’s get Bournvita.

224
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35.030
No…
you want to drink Bournvita?

225
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36.760
What's a big deal?

226
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37.790
How much is it, mister?

227
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:41.510
No problem, sir.
Ma’am will settle it for you.

228
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:47.620
Huh?
Shanu...

229
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54.990
- Have you decided yet?
- Mm-hmm.

230
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:57.820
What do you want to have?

231
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:01.650
Well, it's your treat,
your choice.

232
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03.880
Really? How is it my treat?

233
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08.030
You always bring me to such
expensive restaurants...

234
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11.140
- ...I don't understand the menu.
- It's a punishment...

235
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12.810
...for forgetting our anniversary.

236
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14.620
How can I ever forget
our anniversary, darling?

237
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17.760
- Okay, listen.
- Hmm.

238
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20.680
Well, the eggplant
that you cook is my favourite.

239
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:23.610
Of course, it is.
Because you don't have to cook.

240
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25.780
Tell me. What do you want to eat?

241
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:29.490
Tyagi, tell me.
What does ma'am want to eat?

242
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32.490
Ma'am, we are four of us.

243
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35.060
You can pick anyone you like.

244
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38.330
Naveen, let's get out of here.

245
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41.200
- Ma'am is leaving.
- Let's go.

246
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06.450
You bloody w***e.

247
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07.780
After ruining the men of this town…

248
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09.670
how dare you enter this temple?

249
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13.690
This is God's home,
and not your brothel.

250
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:14.780
Get the hell out of here.

251
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19.460
[Naveen] 'And then one night.'

252
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:23.450
Sh... Shanu?

253
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26.200
What are you doing?

254
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:32.840
Shanu?

255
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38.630
I'm leaving.

256
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43.370
To your parents' ?

257
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47.180
Yeah, you'll feel better.
I'll drop you.

258
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50.900
I'm not going there, Naveen.

259
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:54.590
Where are you going then?

260
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00.600
I don't know.

261
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02.650
But I can't stay here.

262
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06.050
What are you talking about?

263
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11.620
Are you leaving me?

264
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:20.810
This is the only way
to get Rasbhari out of our life.

265
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24.730
No Shanu, no Rasbhari.

266
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26.420
No,no... Shanu...

267
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30.380
I don't want Rasbhari here either.

268
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35.970
But if you leave me,
I'll die.

269
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:48.520
Everything will be all right.
I am with you.

270
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51.860
Then we decided...

271
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:57.930
...to face it together.

272
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02.270
Sir, honestly...

273
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05.520
...your love is exemplary.
.

274
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08.490
I think there should be a movie
based on your story.

275
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11.060
I mean it.

276
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:15.240
And I'm sorry, sir,
for all that nonsense.

277
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17.250
It wasn't your mistake.

278
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21.010
Well, I will go now.

279
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24.600
Sir, if you don't mind...

280
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27.200
...can I talk to ma'am
for a minute?

281
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35.220
Okay. I'll call her.

to you for a minute?
