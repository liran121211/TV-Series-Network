1
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,100
Get outta here! Get!

2
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,550
Get! Get out of here!

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,696
Dustin. Dustin!

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,750
What is that?

5
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:14,960
Holy.

6
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:16,346
You all right?

7
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:18,480
I just... Get out of there!

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,000
- Get the.
- Is there a bear in there?

9
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:26,370
Find a freaking God-dang
big Alaskan grizzly mouse.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,346
Son of a bitch!

11
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:31,246
Get him, Carlos!

12
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:32,556
Bastard!

13
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,170
He's got a miniature bear.
He's got a bear in his...

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,680
In his cabin.

15
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:41,456
Get him!

16
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,556
Son of a bitch!

17
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,286
Do you think he took off?

18
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,976
No. He gone.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
That does it.

20
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,176
All right. Time to get back to work.

21
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,580
Mouse traps. On my list.

22
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,656
He's done for the season.

23
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,146
Something popped.

24
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,931
We gotta have a problem. If we
didn't have problems, it'd be too easy.

25
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,346
- Hey, hey, hey.
- How's it going, man?

26
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,246
Here we go.

27
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,146
Walking to Fred's 80th birthday party.

28
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,060
He's still walking around.
Can you believe that?

29
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:21,346
Love you, Fred.

30
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:22,650
Yeehaw!

31
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,556
This means that dowsing rods are right.

32
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,580
See that?

33
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,346
- Anything?
- Nothing yet.

34
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:36,346
Find me some gold!

35
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:39,076
We had an advantage,
we're losing that advantage.

36
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,246
We got gold!

37
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,680
Thank God!

38
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:51,890
Let's do this.

39
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,556
Dustin and his crew

40
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,076
are a month into a make or break season

41
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,370
on Nugget Creek.

42
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,556
Looks good to me. You ready?

43
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,650
Let's do this. Suit up.

44
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,596
Watch out. It's nugget deep there.

45
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,270
Woah! That deep, dude.

46
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,246
Returning from one of
their worst seasons ever,

47
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:20,060
Dustin's operation is battling
against financial collapse.

48
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,000
We got skunked the last two days.

49
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,176
We got too far off
the center of the creek.

50
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,796
Time to go back
to the center of the creek

51
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,540
and see if there's
any more gold down there.

52
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,340
Last week...

53
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,036
Wow.

54
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,440
Paul hit a hot spot in
the center of the creek.

55
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,790
That's hard pack. Cha-ching!

56
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,456
I see gold.

57
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,480
- Yeah!
- It doesn't get any better than this.

58
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:50,036
That's after two dives, dude.

59
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,650
Finally all this hard work's gonna pay off.

60
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,650
Turn it. It looks like right angle.

61
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,386
There's a crack going down.

62
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,976
He's gonna follow that crack
and it's gonna come up here.

63
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,550
I'll bet this is the little
plunge pool right here.

64
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:10,146
But when they
strayed from the center line...

65
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,696
No gold on that side.

66
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,076
Their hot streak turned cold.

67
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,680
- Nothing.
- You've got to be kidding me.

68
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:22,076
Now, Dustin's got a new plan.

69
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,596
Time to get back to it.

70
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,766
Out towards the center.

71
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:28,036
Gonna go find a pay streak
and follow the pay streak.

72
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,556
We're gonna check the box all the time.

73
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,656
Every couple hours.

74
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,696
I got no time for this
exploration stuff right now.

75
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,486
We need to get paid!

76
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,036
We need gold.

77
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,370
- James, you're in today.
- Yes, sir.

78
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,036
I'm gonna make it
easy on the guys today.

79
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,596
Let me dredge and hopefully nobody

80
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,176
tries to tell me what I
need to do with my dive.

81
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,030
Let the gold hound find the gold.

82
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,580
- You got me, James?
- Yep. I got you.

83
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,346
All right. There's a few rocks right here

84
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,550
but you're just gonna
go to that wall, right?

85
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,286
Follow that edge

86
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,766
and let's just figure out
where the gold starts.

87
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:13,036
- Yeah.
- I'll be down again. We're gonna double down,

88
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,906
we're gonna find out what's in the box.

89
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,370
- I think it's over there.
- I think so, too.

90
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,036
Air check.

91
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,696
- Feeling good?
- Feeling pretty good. Feeling pretty confident.

92
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,270
All right. James,
I need some nuggets, man.

93
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,556
We need some nuggets.

94
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:35,486
- All right.
- I need you to find 'em, seriously, today.

95
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,960
You got it.

96
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,960
This is nice. My God.

97
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,960
This is really nice.

98
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,866
This season, we're wasting a lot of time.

99
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,656
We had an advantage, we started early.

100
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,976
We're losing that advantage right now.

101
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,076
We're looking for life changing gold,

102
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,240
which means we need a pay streak.

103
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,556
To get back on the big nuggets,

104
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:10,146
James must return towards
the center of the creek,

105
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,386
search for the proven pay streak

106
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,960
and then follow the gold.

107
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,866
Somewhere there's a gold line.

108
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,146
We're hoping that it's right here

109
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:23,960
and he hits the center of it
and then we'll follow it.

110
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,766
Whoo! Yeah!

111
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,766
Hey, James, grab a drink for a little while.

112
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,346
I'm gonna go ahead
and check the box here.

113
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,550
Yeah.

114
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,906
Wow. That's something else.

115
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,650
I wanna show you
what's in the box, hold on.

116
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,030
Na... Big rock.

117
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,750
Nothing yet.

118
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,480
Come on, gold.

119
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,866
I know you're down there.

120
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,000
Free yourself.

121
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,030
Jump into my dredge.

122
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,656
I ain't seen one bit of anything
red coming over the back yet.

123
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,170
Not a single thing.

124
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,550
What is he doing?

125
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,170
He's heading straight back downhill.

126
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,060
Instead of chasing
the pay streak up creek...

127
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,386
He went under the dredge.

128
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:19,556
That's started first time.

129
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,890
The gold hound is going rogue.

130
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,790
Where are you going, man?

131
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,976
You going straight downstream or what?

132
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,556
You're underneath the dredge.

133
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,076
You're completely under the dredge.

134
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:37,596
I found a, a hole right
there that I'm cleaning out.

135
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,456
I wouldn't go any further downstream.

136
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:43,440
- Yeah.
- Right there, already got cleaned up by one of them.

137
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,316
- Does that make sense?
- Yeah.

138
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,146
'Cause the hole
was right there somewhere.

139
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,976
All right. Let's get out of here.

140
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,240
Let's go up here.

141
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,960
Keep looking for that hard pack.

142
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,696
He's gotta move upstream.

143
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,386
That's the only way
we're gonna find more gold

144
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02,750
is just keep moving upstream.

145
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:10,060
Find me some gold!

146
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,866
Everybody just wants gold.

147
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,656
Getting a little impatient,
you know what I mean?

148
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:23,076
They wanna see half ounce, one
ounce, two ounce, five ounce nugget.

149
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,866
Everybody is getting tired.

150
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,550
We need our second win.

151
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,656
For three hours, James methodically

152
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,440
inches his way up creek.

153
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,076
How's it looking down there, James?

154
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,656
It's going deeper here.

155
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,860
Sending five tons of
material through the sluice.

156
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,696
There has to be gold in that.

157
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,146
Can we check?

158
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:05,550
There has to be something
in that. I'm in the hard pack.

159
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:06,930
All right.

160
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,060
- Too many big rocks?
- Nothing yet.

161
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:19,960
Nothing.

162
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,270
Keep on looking, man.

163
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,866
I wanna see some red dirt.

164
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:31,030
I'll find a nugget.
They're here somewhere.

165
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,346
I think you're in the right area,

166
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,550
just haven't seen
any red dirt come through.

167
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,340
I'm trying. We'll get it.

168
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,176
It all looks like this. Clear.

169
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,656
So don't know if it's all
washing down on top of him

170
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,976
and that's all he's screening
just washing down.

171
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,656
That's just old we lost last year.

172
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,860
It's not the right color.

173
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,556
This don't make no sense, man.

174
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,556
- Hey, are you on bedrock?
- Yep.

175
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,976
That layer that I just sucked up

176
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,976
is pretty much right on
bedrock but it's this thick.

177
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,696
I just poked into it.

178
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,866
I think you're on the edge
of this start, all right?

179
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:12,170
Let's get this going. Throttle it up.

180
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,860
Hold that thought.

181
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,076
- He needs to be this way.
- -Yeah.

182
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,076
I think so too. He needs
to come that way a little bit.

183
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,456
- Really?
- Yeah, 'cause if you look at that straight line

184
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,340
with that straight line, it would
put the middle right through here.

185
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
- Think so.
- Hey, James.

186
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,766
What is it looking like this way a little bit?

187
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,146
It's just jaggedy. You know,

188
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,866
it's some kind of a layer right here.

189
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,556
But if you're not finding any gold,

190
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,346
it might be better if you come this way

191
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,286
and find out if they're right
and I'm wrong.

192
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:48,286
- Okay.
- As long as you find gold, I don't care if I'm wrong.

193
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,976
Punch it right here, dude.

194
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,146
Okay.

195
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,790
There's gonna be gold in this,
you guys. There has to be.

196
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,146
Try to be patient 'cause I know

197
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:00,750
time's ticking by,
but I need him to find gold.

198
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,550
I found a pocket
that goes down right here.

199
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,146
You're on it now, James.

200
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,790
He's got it up here too.

201
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,146
Wait.

202
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,976
Actually, he's getting
some good stuff now.

203
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,520
I'm starting to see some red come out.

204
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,556
There we go.

205
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,456
That's the first red I've seen in a while.

206
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,976
Can we check?
There has to be gold in that.

207
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,860
Y'all wanna take a look? Good to see?

208
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,650
What have we got here?

209
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,270
Damn! We got gold!

210
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,146
You've got gold!

211
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,170
That's a start.

212
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:47,100
Thank God Thank God!

213
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,650
Slow jackpot.

214
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,346
Up ahead

215
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,456
I'll be gone for a day or two.

216
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,286
You guys just hold down the fort.

217
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,340
Find some gold.

218
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,656
Carlos!

219
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,060
Right here. It hurts so bad!

220
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,146
Hey, Fred.

221
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,370
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

222
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,240
I'll find the nuggets.
They're here somewhere.

223
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,456
At nugget bend,

224
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,556
it's taken James
an exhausting five hours

225
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,750
to hunt down the pay streak.

226
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:33,960
I mean, it's a small piece but it's a start.

227
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:37,060
All right, well, where did we find it?

228
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,766
Right there where you're at?

229
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,656
Just keep coming this way a little bit

230
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,076
and then we'll check the box again

231
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,556
and I think that's the way
you're gonna go.

232
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,866
And if we don't have to
go under that wall,

233
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,370
our life is amazing.

234
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,346
Getting little patches
of hard pack but that's it.

235
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:59,440
You find a little bit of gold
but that's not enough.

236
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,680
I'm getting my ass kicked.

237
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:10,286
The hours of exposure
to the 35 degree water

238
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:12,170
has pushed James to the brink.

239
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,240
I'm just out of steam.

240
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,656
It's just too much.

241
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,480
He sounds a little bit tired?

242
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,036
I think he's done.

243
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,170
All right. Call it a day.

244
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,486
Get the diver up...

245
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,170
Coming up. Now we're up.

246
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,750
Talk about digging.

247
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,146
Good job, man.

248
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:38,286
Whoo! That one worked me a little bit.

249
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,480
Man. I bet.

250
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,246
A lot of digging.

251
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,580
Hey man, go check the box.

252
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,060
- Good job, James.
- Thanks, man.

253
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,556
- Yep.
- All right.

254
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,906
There's a few.

255
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:55,170
There's another nug.

256
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,596
Everybody was talking to me.

257
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:01,146
Dustin was saying, "Hey,
go left, go right, let's follow it."

258
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:03,246
True was able to

259
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,486
hone in on the pay streak again.

260
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:09,036
Like I said, "At the end of the
day there'll be gold in the box."

261
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,596
Dustin said, "There better be."

262
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,960
And I said, "There will be."

263
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,550
We're on it.

264
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,656
Good job, man.

265
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,960
Got some gold, bro.

266
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,820
Got some gold, man!

267
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,346
All that came from the center?

268
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:24,246
Yeah. The middle right through here.

269
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:27,596
- Still gold.
- Still gold. That's plenty.

270
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:32,176
As of right now, gold streak
is lining up in the middle,

271
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,386
but we won't know for sure
until we have proven James' lead.

272
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,486
We wanna bleed this creek dry.

273
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,240
We want gold. We want nuggets.

274
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,766
As daylight fades over nugget creek

275
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:50,176
I hate doing this but I gotta go.

276
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,246
Got family first, man.

277
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:55,860
Dustin prepares
for a long hard journey ahead.

278
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,866
I'm heading to town so I can
make it over Fred's place

279
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,726
for his 80th birthday party.

280
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,240
I'll be gone for a day or two.

281
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,286
Two months ago,
Fred was dealt shocking news.

282
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:14,550
A diagnosis of
life-threatening brain tumors.

283
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:22,550
- How long did they give you?
- Anywhere from a few months to six months.

284
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:28,866
Hopefully, you make it long enough to
where we can show you some gold, man.

285
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,346
That's my gold.

286
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,860
So bring me some.

287
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,726
I love you.

288
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,650
- Hope we get to see you again.
- Keep in touch.

289
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,076
You guys just hold down the fort.

290
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,556
You know what to do.

291
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,976
We got you covered, man.

292
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,766
I might be gone a couple days,
so take care of everything, right?

293
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:45,726
Yeah.

294
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,556
- Find some gold.
- We will, lots of gold.

295
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,976
- Lots of gold.
- Tell Fred happy birthday for us.

296
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Tell Fred happy birthday.

297
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:01,076
Dustin's off to Fred's 80th birthday party.

298
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,656
We're gonna try
real hard to get a lot of gold

299
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,440
put in the box while he's gone.

300
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:15,766
Looks good so far.

301
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,750
Don't know if we can get a good dive in.

302
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,076
Let's find 10 ounces today, man.

303
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,386
Yeah.

304
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:25,556
You know what? What more
can Fred ask for his 80th birthday?

305
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,246
Then let's send him
some pictures of a bunch

306
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,866
of big nuggets that we just found.

307
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:31,860
- I agree. Let's do that.
- Yeah, this is for Fred.

308
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:37,146
Today's mission,
pick up where James left off

309
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,766
and follow the pay streak up creek

310
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:43,766
in the hope that it leads to a pile of gold.

311
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:46,246
Well, guess I'll start getting suited up.

312
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:49,766
If it wasn't for Fred, none of us
would be here doing this, so...

313
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:52,130
It would definitely be good to
show a lot of gold for Fred.

314
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,726
Valve open.

315
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,146
All right. Let's activate the gold fall.

316
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,170
Have a good dive, man.
Let's get us some gold.

317
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,766
Looks like a lot of kitty litter in right here.

318
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,550
I'll get that cleaned out
real quick and then

319
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,440
give me a deep spot.

320
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,680
Filters look good.

321
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,386
Dredge is running good.

322
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:25,556
And in a little bit we'll do a box check,

323
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:31,170
double down and I guarantee
it, there'll be gold in that box.

324
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,170
Guarantee it.

325
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,866
Looks like there's a little
bit of harsh right there.

326
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:46,976
I see red coming up.

327
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,976
Red dirt is the surest
sign they're on the gold.

328
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,656
Whoo! Look at that.

329
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,976
Wow!

330
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,766
Yeah, Paul, you're in the red.
You are in the red.

331
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,036
- Seriously.
- Good job.

332
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,340
Yeah.

333
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,976
Yeah, I'm not even sure
if I'm even on the bottom yet.

334
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,456
Pull the dredge forward just a little bit.

335
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,246
I can't get the nozzle in the water.

336
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,370
Copy that.

337
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,000
Have a freaking strange job.

338
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:15,550
Carlos!

339
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,480
- You all right?
- Something popped!

340
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:27,860
God, no!

341
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,550
It was just the way my leg
went, man. Something popped.

342
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,906
We get medic down for Carlos, please.

343
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:41,146
Over three hours
from the nearest doctor,

344
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:43,550
the camera crew's medic steps in.

345
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:50,866
Right here. It hurts so bad.

346
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:53,486
- In here? Need to go hard.
- Right there. Right there.

347
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:57,860
Man, I just saw Carlos take a
tumble on the rocks over there and.

348
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,766
I thought for sure he was
done for the season.

349
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,556
That's the last thing we need,

350
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,240
is someone to get hurt
and have to get out of here.

351
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,650
I'm in pain, dude.

352
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,866
- Carlos.
- I'm good.

353
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:20,860
No. Just sit back
for a little bit. We got this.

354
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,976
1,200 miles south...

355
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,976
So right now I'm driving to Fred's place

356
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,146
to his 80th birthday.

357
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:38,726
He invited me,
he asked me to show up, so,

358
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:42,146
I took off work and here I am.

359
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,486
He'll be excited for me

360
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:46,766
but he's not doing very good right now.

361
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,556
But it's good that I get to see him.

362
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,960
He's my father.

363
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,146
- Hey, Fred.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

364
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,246
How's it going man?

365
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:02,130
My legs are not operating very well.

366
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,556
They never did.

367
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,346
Well, they did pretty good.

368
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:07,000
- Not bad.
- Yeah.

369
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,486
- Little by little.
- Yeah?

370
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,346
- Yeah.
- How is things, man?

371
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:13,556
I look like I'll make it today okay.

372
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,860
- Okay.
- Um...

373
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,550
You know, if whatever,
you just have to get by

374
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,650
and see what kind of...

375
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,410
What I can make out of all of this.

376
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:30,346
Seems to be a losing battle right now.

377
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:31,386
Yeah.

378
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:35,076
Hey, this is like a bolt
out of the blue, man.

379
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,486
You know, it's not exactly
something you can predict.

380
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,750
I get it.

381
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,346
I don't think he'd respect me

382
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:44,726
if I came at him with a sad, sob face

383
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,976
and went, "how are you doing, Fred?"

384
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,440
No. That's not what he wants.

385
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,386
I always saw you just

386
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:52,146
flipping the machine off a cliff.

387
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,820
That's kinda what I thought.

388
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,286
We've got a lot of time working together,

389
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,076
we're both stubborn.

390
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,176
It was never gonna be
easy working with Fred.

391
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,656
It was never gonna be all
easy working with me.

392
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,930
We made it through all that.

393
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,246
What, you getting some gold?

394
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,906
Finding stuff.

395
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:13,860
First dive, found a half ounce nugget.

396
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,976
Look at how red it is, though.

397
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,286
Got your glasses with you somewhere?

398
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:20,960
- Wow.
- Feel that?

399
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,370
That's hilarious.

400
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:34,036
We're not perfect
but we've accomplished

401
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,836
some amazing damn things together,

402
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,030
bickering the whole damn way.

403
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,550
That is nice.

404
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:44,146
It's in that red layer, for sure.

405
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:46,596
- So there's this layer about that thick.
- Yeah.

406
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,246
And, hopefully, right now,
they're back on this stuff

407
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:52,866
getting an ounce-ish a day.

408
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,146
Wow.

409
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,960
Yeah. If we can continue on
this, we will get a ton of gold.

410
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:04,146
I think if we just keep
right on it there, and just...

411
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,596
Gonna have to get down to the bedrock.

412
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:10,346
- That red layer.
- All there is to it.

413
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:13,076
I had to trust my guys to go
up there and mine without me,

414
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,146
run the dredge without me.

415
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,836
Hopefully, they don't kill each other,

416
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:21,386
- or themselves.
- Well, maybe they'll get some gold.

417
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:23,456
- That would be lovely.
- -Then, everybody can say,

418
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,766
"they're getting more gold than Dustin

419
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:28,286
- when he's there."
- "They don't even need Dustin out there.

420
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:30,866
He's been holding them back
the whole time."

421
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:33,890
That's exactly right.
Digging in the wrong place.

422
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,656
I'm glad I got to see you, Fred.

423
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,596
I don't know how Fred has the
stamina even in his ailment right now.

424
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,650
He's in bad shape, so...

425
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,440
Can't believe he actually
just keeps kicking. It's crazy.

426
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:53,866
Up ahead...

427
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,486
What the hell?

428
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:58,036
The whole is backing the
dredges underneath the water.

429
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,286
Shut it off!

430
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,176
What the.

431
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,766
Dowsing rods better work.

432
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:04,076
Dowsing rods, man.

433
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:07,176
At this pace, I'm about to call
1-800-psychic, come to me.

434
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,790
Where is that gold?

435
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,340
Yeah, we're getting a lot of material.
Holy moly!

436
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,550
At Nugget Creek,

437
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:25,626
Paul chases the pay streak upstream.

438
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:28,416
Paul's a freaking rock star, man.

439
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,036
Right now, we're gonna push it
as long as we possibly can.

440
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,246
Our main goal is to get
as much gold in the box.

441
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,866
We wanna make Dustin and Fred proud.

442
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:40,246
You are so deep, Paul. Unbelievable.

443
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:43,556
I can't believe how deep it's going.

444
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,936
And there's still no signs
of the bottom yet.

445
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:50,106
So much, I can't get the nozzle down
to touch whatever I got down there.

446
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:52,726
We're gonna have to pull
the dredge forward,

447
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:56,076
- and scoop everything up through the nozzle.
- -Okay.

448
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,720
How far will it go forward?

449
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,550
Pull it against this wall.

450
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:03,976
They're moving forward, Paul,

451
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,750
so you should get some stick right now.

452
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,310
How's that?

453
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,100
Good deal, thanks.

454
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,526
- What the have we got going on over here?
- -What the hell?

455
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:31,410
The whole is backing the
dredges underneath the water.

456
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,170
Shut it off!

457
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:37,820
- What the.
- Go ahead. We don't have a idea.

458
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,860
I'm a little frustrated.

459
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:45,526
I should be dredging,

460
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,726
but I'm not dredging, I'm
not putting gold in the box.

461
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,866
To me, this is a waste of time.

462
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:52,346
Was it just that the tailings
had nowhere to go?

463
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:53,720
Yeah.

464
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:58,456
In a rush to put the gold in the box,

465
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,656
the crew dragged the dredge up-creek,

466
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,006
but failed to plan
where the tailings would go.

467
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:09,416
Rock and gravel
piled on top of the sluice,

468
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,750
sinking the most critical part
of their operation.

469
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,316
So, if we can get that with the long hose,

470
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:20,416
we will start over and try to save the dive.

471
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,060
All right. Well, I'm gonna go.

472
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:24,726
The dredge hose is not long enough.

473
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,216
We're gonna have to pull
the dredge forward.

474
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,316
So we were just putting
tailings right in our pond

475
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,526
which just sank the whole back
of the dredge.

476
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,146
So we're putting the long hose on,

477
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:34,076
and then sending
the sluice box over the rear

478
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,750
so we don't put
any more tailings in our pond.

479
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:40,216
Ready? One, two, three.

480
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,316
One, two, three.

481
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:45,060
All right. Now, go ahead and
start that. We'll see what happens.

482
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,200
That'll work.

483
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,860
All righty, let's try this again.

484
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:02,340
Yeah. It's got suction.

485
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:09,836
If all these things happen and
Dustin was here, no comment.

486
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,860
- This little fella was just a hiccup.
- -Yeah.

487
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,440
Yeah. We got red coming out
now, that's what we're looking for.

488
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,650
Paul must be getting into the hard pack.

489
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:32,246
With all the mishaps that we had today,

490
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:35,246
Paul's a trooper, bro. He
went back right into the water,

491
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:38,656
found the red hard pack
that we've all been looking for,

492
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,960
the telltale sign that there is gold here.

493
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:51,006
After a rocky start...

494
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:55,000
Holy moly, man. You're in
the red, man. You broke a seal.

495
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,866
Paul muscles through...

496
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:02,146
That is spilled on straight now.

497
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:05,410
Putting in nearly five hours of dive time.

498
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:12,270
Diver coming up.

499
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:17,106
- You're a trooper, dude.
- With all that bull

500
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:18,246
that was going on today, man,

501
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,006
anybody else would've said, "this."

502
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:22,820
I had to see what was there.
I'm goal-driven.

503
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:30,076
There's a little bit of gold in there, man.

504
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:33,556
- Is there, really?
- Yeah, just a... a piece here and there, man.

505
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:37,836
- I mean, after all the bull today.
- Mother.

506
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:42,440
The lack of gold is a clear
sign they've lost the pay streak.

507
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,006
It was a rough day for everybody, so,

508
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:49,936
tomorrow, we need to go back and reset.

509
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,060
There's gotta be gold.

510
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:03,340
Holy moly, man, it got cold!

511
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,130
Man.

512
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,766
We're moving upstream pretty quickly,

513
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,720
but we gotta figure out
where the gold's at.

514
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,866
I got an idea, one of our good buddies,

515
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:15,866
his grandfather used
dowsing rods back in the day.

516
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:19,246
They showed the areas
where the gold was.

517
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,906
Does that work?

518
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:24,010
Well, if we brought these out in front of
Dustin, he would say, "Mumbo jumbo."

519
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:31,006
Dowsing is an ancient practice
used to locate groundwater,

520
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:34,866
buried metals, gemstones, and oil.

521
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:40,416
The rods are said to move when
the dowser moves over its target.

522
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:46,620
But scientific evidence shows dowsing
is no more effective than random chance.

523
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:52,526
Despite the controversy,
many like Wes and Paul

524
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:57,456
believe the practice of dowsing
can lead them to the promised land.

525
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,866
I made these dowsing rods out
of some copper wire that I had,

526
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:03,416
but I'm gonna stick a little
piece of gold on the end of 'em

527
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:09,036
to charge 'em up a little bit to see
if it'll help us locate any more gold.

528
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,556
I probably wouldn't do this
if Dustin was here,

529
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,976
because he would think
that I'm wasting time.

530
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,726
But he's not here, we're
under our own control right now,

531
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:18,726
so we're all about getting gold.

532
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:21,130
Then I can put a big ol'
glob of that on the bottom.

533
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,456
I dropped it.

534
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,170
That nugget fell right off.

535
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,836
What?

536
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,936
- God dang!
- The man.

537
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,100
There we go. That was close.

538
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,650
Dowsing rods, man.

539
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,726
Old timers used 'em.

540
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:43,076
And they say it seems to work. I...

541
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,346
If I hit some gold, I want 'em to cross.

542
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:48,526
At this pace, I'm about to call
1-800-psychic, come to me.

543
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:49,906
Where is that gold?

544
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:52,550
- Can't hurt anything.
- I like it. I think it's awesome.

545
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,106
Doesn't look too bad so far.

546
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:03,346
Well, I'm gonna go back
and forth across the creek,

547
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:05,440
try to come across some gold.

548
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,036
What do you think Dustin's gonna say?

549
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,076
This was a freakin' waste of
time and a waste of money?

550
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,200
To help.

551
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:16,146
- See that?
- Right here.

552
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:17,556
Right there.

553
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,556
All right, let's tell Paul.

554
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:24,866
Wes is trying out his new witching
rods, and they crossed right there.

555
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:27,006
Maybe there's a big nugget sitting there.

556
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,146
I'm really curious.

557
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:30,416
I think we can follow this.

558
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,720
Right here, stay on this side of that.

559
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:37,976
Identified as a hotspot
by the dowsing rods,

560
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,650
it's up to James to prove if
this method is fact, or fiction.

561
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,836
Let's go.

562
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,240
I will find some gold.

563
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,550
Dowsing rods better work.

564
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:59,240
And my hope today is to
pick out a fistful of nuggets.

565
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,960
Let the gold hound find the gold.

566
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:19,240
Boy, are we digging now.

567
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,866
At Nugget Creek,

568
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:26,170
James's dig is being led
to the gold from above.

569
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,076
We know there's gold here.

570
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,556
Now we're going for the mother load.

571
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,556
Anything we can do right now
to lighten the pressure on Dustin,

572
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,340
we need to do that.

573
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,960
I smell gold!

574
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,836
Holy moly, dude.

575
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:44,216
That red material in that stank pretty bad.

576
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,626
Yeah?

577
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:48,620
You're in the red, James.
You're in the red, man.

578
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:51,030
I am the gold hound.

579
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:59,316
1,200 miles south in Oregon,

580
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,720
there is also reason to celebrate.

581
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:05,936
Look at that car.

582
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,036
Today is Fred's 80th birthday,

583
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:13,556
and he's planning on arriving
to his party in style.

584
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,036
You like that green?

585
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,866
I like it.

586
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:19,626
- Looking sharp.
- Yeah, man. That's looking real good.

587
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:23,130
- Better than the black.
- -Yeah, it looks damn nice, man.

588
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:28,480
Try to crank it up, see if it'll run.

589
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,860
That's nice, Fred.

590
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,440
Yeah, baby.

591
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,340
It's really damn hard to keep
a steady speed with this thing.

592
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:54,836
When you were 20, where'd you
think you'd be at 80 years old, Fred?

593
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:57,936
I don't know
what I would've thought then.

594
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,036
Not in Oregon in a hot rod.

595
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:02,076
Nope.

596
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:06,246
You just never know what
life is gonna take you on.

597
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,410
Right?

598
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:23,146
- Here we are, Fred.
- All righty.

599
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:26,440
That's you right there.
"Welcome to Fred's 80th birthday party."

600
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,340
Well, hello there.

601
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:34,726
Happy birthday, Fred.

602
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,720
- Hey, how're you doing?
- I'm good.

603
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:40,526
Family and friends from across the US

604
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:44,310
and wife Jen gather to
celebrate with Dakota Fred.

605
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,076
Hey, how're you doing, man?

606
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,346
It's real good to see you.

607
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:50,726
I brought him to his party.

608
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:54,146
I had to hold him up half
the time, but he did real good.

609
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:56,550
He's still walking around.
Can you believe that?

610
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,820
Hey.

611
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:02,556
So, I'm gonna go hang
out with everybody, but

612
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:07,456
it's not my best attribute, is
mingling with 50 people or 100 people.

613
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,346
That's just really not my thing.

614
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:12,130
I run out of things to say.
I'm not that interesting.

615
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,836
I just basically wanted
to come down here and see him.

616
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:22,836
The party and the nuggets, showing
him, all that stuff is secondary.

617
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,270
I wanted to see Fred.

618
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,526
We love you, Fred.

619
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:50,976
Appreciate it, everybody.

620
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,890
Thank you for coming. I know a lot
of you guys came from a long way off.

621
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:59,726
It's been a wonderful 80 years.

622
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:02,270
I probably did a lot of things
that I shouldn't have.

623
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:10,456
Just wanna let you know that I'm glad
that you guys have passed through my life,

624
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,340
and hope you meet
some people as nice as me.

625
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:23,310
We love you, Fred!

626
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,656
I feel a little twirly right now.

627
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,346
That was cool. I enjoyed that.

628
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:35,526
Good to see a lot of
people here that I know.

629
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:39,416
Some of 'em are local,
some are through from Texas.

630
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,130
Can't believe they flew from
Texas to come all the way over here.

631
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:49,146
Well, thank you, guys, for
being here for this special night.

632
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,550
So, here we go.

633
00:34:56,790 --> 00:35:00,526
We just had so many of our
friends here in our hometown

634
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,976
who've come to celebrate him.

635
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,076
I think everything went really well

636
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:07,410
and he was happy to be here
and celebrate it with his friends.

637
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:14,200
This was my bucket list.

638
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:19,246
Had a great day.
One hell of a 80th birthday.

639
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:22,866
You only get to celebrate 80th one time.

640
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:25,146
But when you've lived a good, long life,

641
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:27,000
eighty is good enough.

642
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:31,976
Make the most of what you got.

643
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,866
I'm happy with my life.

644
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:35,626
Y'all have a good day.

645
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:37,620
Happy birthday.

646
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,480
Up ahead...

647
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:57,766
- Ancient gold, dude.
- Yeah!

648
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:58,960
That's badass!

649
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,030
Fistful of nuggets.

650
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:08,766
Fred, wish you were
up here with us, man.

651
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:13,286
At Nugget Camp, the miners
celebrate Fred's birthday,

652
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:15,000
Alaskan style.

653
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,656
That was cool!

654
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,960
My God!

655
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,936
Look at the bucket.

656
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,200
Happy birthday, Fred!

657
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,906
It's just weird down here.

658
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:51,410
There's, like, crooked edges
going up and down everywhere.

659
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:55,626
There's a round rock caught in it.

660
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:57,286
There's slate hard pack.

661
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:59,410
Sounds like those are
the gold caps to me.

662
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:05,696
At Nugget Creek, James
is six hours into his dive,

663
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,130
led by Wes's dowsing rods.

664
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:15,100
I think we're close to something good.

665
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,960
Let's see if I can get a line where he's at.

666
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:30,006
The dowsing rods say we got a big
payday sitting right underneath us.

667
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:33,246
I got a feeling it's gonna be right
here where these boulders are.

668
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:36,480
I do, too. That's exactly
what the dowsing rods say.

669
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,146
James, come this way.

670
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:40,820
All right, I'm gonna come this way.

671
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:44,596
When I grab my dowsing rods,
they come across this way.

672
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,146
When I get to about where he's at,

673
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:49,416
and I get just a little bit
more to the center,

674
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,596
and then, they wanna cross.

675
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:53,246
It's probably just a good line
right through here.

676
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:54,480
There's a good pay streak.

677
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,960
Boy, are we digging now.

678
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:03,386
I can smell nuggets.

679
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:06,726
Sounds like James found some
interesting bedrock features.

680
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,130
Lot of hard pack.

681
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,486
That's a good sign.

682
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:12,346
Once he gets all that cleared out,

683
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:15,000
hoping there's a lot of gold
in the box when he's done.

684
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,890
Has to be nuggets in here.

685
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,550
Got some solid.

686
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,556
So far, James has moved a lot of
material. He's got a lot of rock out.

687
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:33,006
Once we find that dig spot,
that's where the gold is gonna be.

688
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:35,006
This is what kinda stuff I'm getting into,

689
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:36,820
rusted hard pack.

690
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,030
Open this thing up, get to the
bottom, what Wes was talking about.

691
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,146
I may have seen some gold.

692
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:49,416
I just gotta get rid
of some of this hard pack

693
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,316
and just break it up.

694
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,726
And once I start punching the bedrock...

695
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:57,340
- Yeah.
- And clean out the whole area, it should produce.

696
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:02,556
James is definitely onto that hard pack,

697
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,286
and he's not even at the bottom.

698
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:08,216
So, dig, dig, dig, James! Dig, James!

699
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,100
Get us some gold. You're on it.

700
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,310
My wrists are popping.

701
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:23,176
My wrists are hurting!

702
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,076
That was a hell of a long dive today.

703
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,820
- Yeah.
- -I think that's good for now.

704
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:32,556
All right, man.

705
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,860
- Good job, brother.
- That was rough.

706
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,796
Now, it's time to see if
Wes's mystical method

707
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,480
has delivered the gold.

708
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,200
I don't know what to think, man.

709
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:52,626
- See how heavy that is.
- Yeah! Ancient gold, dude!

710
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:54,836
That's in that red layer.

711
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:57,836
- There's smaller gold in there, too, James.
- That's badass, dude.

712
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,866
There's definitely
smaller gold in here, too.

713
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:01,526
My God, that's crazy.

714
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:03,006
It's heavy as heck.

715
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:05,976
- This just has a different look.
- -It does.

716
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,480
Damn, that's heavy.

717
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,960
Yeah!

718
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,766
Whoo, James!

719
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:14,216
Handful, bro!

720
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,626
That's where your witching
sticks told him to go.

721
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:21,006
There was a pocket, dead
center where Wes went dowsing.

722
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,456
Line of gold nuggets.

723
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,526
We're following that line
right up the center.

724
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:28,240
All in all, it was a great dive today for me.

725
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,410
Pat myself on the back.

726
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:33,246
Fistful of nuggets.

727
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:34,510
That makes me happy.

728
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,246
After a week of pain and disappointment,

729
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:43,656
Wes's dowsing has them back
on the pay streak.

730
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:48,246
Question is, will Dustin be
happy with the way things went?

731
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:50,000
I sure to hell hope so.

732
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:53,620
Honestly, I really sure hope so.

733
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:00,146
On the next Gold Rush White Water

734
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:03,200
I'm gonna try to get to the
bedrock as quick as I can.

735
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:06,286
Hey, back up,
back up, back up, back up...

736
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:09,176
My God! Look at that!

737
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,146
You've blown everybody away!

738
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:13,906
- At least five ounces.
- -I hit the jackpot today.

739
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:14,930
Big nuggets!

740
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,526
Finally, on some good gold.

741
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:22,906
If all the stories are true, that
one-ounce nugget is just the beginning.

742
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:24,200
We got a future, dude!

743
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,000
Hey, guys, I have some bad news.
