1
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,476
- Mornin', fellas.
- Mornin'.

2
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,276
In remote southeast Alaska,

3
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,876
<i>Dustin hurt and his crew</i>

4
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,836
<i>are on the richest
gold streak of their lives.</i>

5
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,930
- Hell of a day, James!
- Yeah, man.

6
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,976
These guys, they worked so hard.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,676
We're getting gold and
we're getting it early.

8
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,276
<i>But we're not just getting
regular gold, we're getting big gold.</i>

9
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,736
Like, huge gold for this area.

10
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,436
James went down and
found more gold in one day

11
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,636
than we've had in entire seasons.

12
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,076
On his last dive,

13
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:52,530
<i>James delivered the biggest
single day gold haul ever.</i>

14
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,436
So, we're gonna weigh this gold up.

15
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,830
All right.

16
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,076
My god! 1.19.

17
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,936
- I told you! I told you!
- Holy moly, dude!

18
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,336
Put some of them other ones on there.

19
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,930
That's absolutely the
biggest one we've ever had.

20
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:19,136
- My god!
- 3.87 ounces.

21
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,736
- Wow.
- -Almost four ounces in one day, James.

22
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,389
Yeah, man!

23
00:01:22,413 --> 00:01:25,136
Look at the size of those
nuggets you got, dude.

24
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,436
- Look at that...
- I'm gonna have a heart attack... Nuts.

25
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:30,836
That's a $3,000 nugget. That
one nugget is worth three grand.

26
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:31,664
Well, maybe more.

27
00:01:31,688 --> 00:01:33,736
James, you've had
the best dive so far, man.

28
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,776
- Ever. Ever!
- We've been ever doing

29
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,721
just about half an ounce
per dive until today.

30
00:01:38,745 --> 00:01:39,236
Yeah.

31
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:42,836
Everybody, just look at
this, feel this, and enjoy it.

32
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,276
James found a bunch of nuggets.

33
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,076
We found the gold line, finally.

34
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,476
It's probably only about this wide.

35
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,076
But it's an actual line that
goes straight up the damn creek,

36
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,976
and we just need to follow it,
and there's gonna be plenty of this.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,836
Now we gotta put in the work.

38
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,176
Put in the work, get the gold,

39
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,860
and it's going to change our entire lives.

40
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,836
That wall is coming down on you.

41
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,036
Gonna fall on your head and
crush you like a damn bug.

42
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,876
Holy crap, man! You couldn't
be in a worse place in the world.

43
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,076
<i>Get out of there!</i>

44
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,230
Right back!

45
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,360
Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it!

46
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,976
I have visions of it being the worst day.

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,430
Is the gold worth it?

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,576
I just don't want to die.

49
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,976
We spent seven years
just killing ourselves.

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,336
We stuck it out. We put in the effort.

51
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,930
<i>We got this.</i>

52
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,636
Whoo-ho! Look at that.

53
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,560
Black gold...

54
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,776
My god!

55
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,730
Look what you just found, buddy.

56
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,000
<i>My god!</i>

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,576
There we go.

58
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,560
That's the biggest
nugget in gold rush history!

59
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,476
Another day, another dollar. I'm excited.

60
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,736
Just 12 hours after their
best day of mining ever,

61
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,260
<i>the crew is ready to pick
up right where they left off.</i>

62
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,236
We know that there's gold here now.

63
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,136
<i>We just gotta go get it.</i>

64
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,536
<i>- I wanna see it.
- I gotta hold it.</i>

65
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,436
And then you gonna see
that hoop and hollering.

66
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,360
You know what I mean?
The jig, you know...

67
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,736
Doing the jig and all that.

68
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,430
I gotta get focused for the gold.

69
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,760
<i>Over two months ago</i>

70
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,176
<i>the miners were
handed the ultimate test.</i>

71
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,177
Whoa!

72
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:57,736
Mother nature beat us last year.

73
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,836
We couldn't afford to
bring everybody back.

74
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,936
So, this is us.

75
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,776
We're gonna have to
hit it as hard as we can

76
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,836
because we know the rains are coming.

77
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,736
The scaled back operation
has meant double the work.

78
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,536
- Keep going.
- Keep going. Keep going.

79
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,076
Keep going. Keep going.
It's going underwater.

80
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,436
Pull, pull, pull, pull, pull, pull, pull.

81
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,776
And a relentless fight to overcome

82
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,636
<i>a never-ending barrage of obstacles.</i>

83
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,136
Watch out behind you!

84
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,660
Carlos is pinned!

85
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,976
Get him out of there!

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,336
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

87
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,036
Whoo. Okay, got it.

88
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,900
Every time mother nature
tried to knock 'em down...

89
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,236
Carlos!

90
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,776
- You all right?
- Something popped.

91
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,230
<i>The crew fought back
with everything they had.</i>

92
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,636
Holy moly, man!

93
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,236
Whoo! I kicked its butt!

94
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,836
And their determination paid off.

95
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,836
- , a nugget!
- No way!

96
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,076
It's a nugget?

97
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,576
First gold ever this early!

98
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,536
Until a bombshell rocked
Dustin and his crew.

99
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,360
I got a message this
morning that, Fred died.

100
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,136
And he went peaceful in his sleep.

101
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,300
He said he wasn't in any pain.

102
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,736
- I'm sorry, man.
- -Sorry to hear about that.

103
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,236
Try to be patient with me.

104
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,776
- Just lost my father.
- Yeah.

105
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,636
And he'd give you the shirt off his back.

106
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,036
That's enough of that.

107
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,076
That's too much.

108
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,476
Driven to honor Fred's legacy

109
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,236
I wish Fred was here with us.

110
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:43,536
Maybe from above, he's helping us out.

111
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,976
<i>The crew refused to back down</i>

112
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,236
<i>from their toughest season ever.</i>

113
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,136
<i>That just drops off, man, to oblivion.</i>

114
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,976
Holy moly!

115
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,976
I hit the jackpot today. Big nuggets!

116
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,830
My first thought was to call to tell Fred.

117
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,136
Everybody wants to be that
person to come up with nuggets.

118
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,536
It's a contagious disease.

119
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,136
Once I see the gold,

120
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,730
the excitement's just gonna... Boom!

121
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,336
<i>Change everybody's future for the best.</i>

122
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,160
<i>Gold, gold, gold, man.</i>

123
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,236
<i>- All right, here's the deal.
- You're gonna dredge.</i>

124
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,436
<i>All right.</i>

125
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,360
- You're gonna find gold.
- -Dredge, find gold.

126
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,760
<i>- All right, guys.
- Going in the water.</i>

127
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,130
All right.

128
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,060
<i>- Nice deep hole, guys.
- You guys did a great job.</i>

129
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,176
Right about where you're at, Carlos,

130
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,176
<i>on that shelf, is where I was
seeing nuggets yesterday.</i>

131
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,736
- Gotcha, man.
- I'm looking. I'm looking.

132
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,130
<i>I'm looking.</i>

133
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,530
<i>Can I get that sprayer
down here, please?</i>

134
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,936
<i>- I got it right here.
- Thank you.</i>

135
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,336
Looking for James' nuggets.

136
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,536
The gold.

137
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,476
Carlos uses the high-pressured hose

138
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,176
<i>to break up the centuries old hard pack</i>

139
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,936
<i>and free the ancient gold locked inside.</i>

140
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,336
You know what, like, seven
years we've been burned,

141
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,676
so we all got that feeling of, like,
"is this actually gonna happen?"

142
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,136
And it still doesn't feel like it.

143
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,976
- Yeah, I know.
- -Well, let's see how this goes.

144
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,136
I know it seems too good to be true.

145
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,430
It might be that we blow this out and...

146
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,236
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!
- Yeah.

147
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:57,476
I know there's nuggets left
behind because I didn't finish it.

148
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,736
- Yeah.
- I wanted it so bad.

149
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,960
I'm like, "you know what? I'm gonna
let Carlos get some of that glory."

150
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,560
In this hole, <i>and I am
finding the small gold</i>

151
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,776
<i>in the layer and the hard pack.</i>

152
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,536
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

153
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,476
<i>- All right.
- Yeah.</i>

154
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,836
<i>And it seems it's going toward the Weir.</i>

155
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,330
So, it's the Weir.

156
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,860
So, I mean, it's going down.

157
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,576
<i>I'm at hard pack.</i>

158
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,530
- All right.
- I like to hear that.

159
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,136
<i>Following the deepest
part of the bedrock</i>

160
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:43,136
<i>on the center line,
Carlos found an anomaly.</i>

161
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:47,736
<i>Instead of going up, the
creek bed is dropping down</i>

162
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,830
<i>into what could be the
perfect nugget catch.</i>

163
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,230
Carlos is finding gold.

164
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,476
Which I love.

165
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,836
He said this bedrock's
coming up on the right side,

166
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,630
and it looks like it's going
deeper towards the Weir.

167
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,030
Whoo!

168
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,036
That's the color I wanna
see coming across right there.

169
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:19,330
The red and the black both, that's
absolutely what we're looking for.

170
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,330
That's what I call acing nuggets.

171
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,736
We've gotta keep an eye on the
blocks on that one rock right there.

172
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,036
I don't like that.

173
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,836
Those aren't so bad, but that one,

174
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,630
well, that one's too, but...

175
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,476
He might be able to pull it off
the wall and pull it right behind him.

176
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,776
The more he comes into the Weir,

177
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,376
the steeper the wall
gets, the more chance

178
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,836
of some of these rocks
falling in on top of him so...

179
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,236
Following the nugget-rich center line

180
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,936
<i>is taking Carlos straight into the Weir,</i>

181
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,336
<i>where towering 12 ft above him</i>

182
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:11,430
<i>are a thousand boulders that could
come crashing down at any time.</i>

183
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,136
I come over here periodically,

184
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,976
check 'em, make sure nothing's moving.

185
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,860
If they move, I'll get them out of the way.

186
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,560
We do not wanna crush the divers.

187
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,160
Man, that's pretty good.

188
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,230
<i>This is a little bit deeper spot.</i>

189
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,330
<i>Getting a lot of material out, for sure.</i>

190
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,576
<i>It's a crack, man.</i>

191
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,630
<i>It goes underneath the hard pack.</i>

192
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,930
<i>Carlos, get out of there!</i>

193
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,660
- What happened?
- I don't know.

194
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,560
Come get him.

195
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,736
- You all right?
- Yeah.

196
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,176
<i>Did you get clipped.</i>

197
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,436
Yeah. Right there.

198
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,176
That was a close one,
dude. How big was it?

199
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,136
That big. It just took off my index finger.

200
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,160
- You good?
- It's good. It's good. I got this.

201
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,930
Despite being hit by falling rocks,

202
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:33,236
<i>for three hours Carlos fights on,</i>

203
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:37,060
<i>determined to cash in
on their golden hot streak.</i>

204
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,636
<i>What's the story, Carlos?</i>

205
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,236
<i>It's time to double
down and check the box?</i>

206
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,276
Yeah, it'd be good time
to double down, man,

207
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,176
<i>and check the box.</i>

208
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,060
<i>- I'm at bedrock right here.
- It's just bedrock right here.</i>

209
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,376
I'm just curious.

210
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,460
Did he get all of it...

211
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,436
They found... Hey!

212
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,836
My god! Carlos.

213
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,436
I gotta see it.

214
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,076
<i>I gotta see it!</i>

215
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,860
<i>My god.</i>

216
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,236
Let me go show him.

217
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,436
My god.

218
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,860
- Holy!
- -I gotta see it!

219
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,076
<i>Carlos, you ain't gonna believe this.</i>

220
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,530
<i>You ready for this?</i>

221
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,136
<i>Look what you just found, buddy.</i>

222
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,400
My god!

223
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,736
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay. Don't, don't, don't...

224
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,976
Holy!

225
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,460
Don't lose that

226
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,530
my god!

227
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,830
Can you believe that?

228
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,136
<i>- You found it.
- Holy!</i>

229
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,076
Let's see it. Let's see it.

230
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,330
My god.

231
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,236
That ain't no joke right there.

232
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,536
That is no joke.

233
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:08,866
Wow!

234
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:11,636
That's the biggest
nugget in gold rush history.

235
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,260
Yup.

236
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,736
My god!

237
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,976
- Carlos, Carlos.
- I gotta see it!

238
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,436
You ready for this?

239
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,776
Look what you just found, buddy.

240
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,660
My god!

241
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,060
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

242
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,976
At nugget bend,

243
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,836
<i>Carlos has just uncovered a nugget</i>

244
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:45,460
<i>that could change the
course of their lives.</i>

245
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,776
- Look at that big piece of gold.
- -Wow!

246
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,476
That's at least four ounces, man.

247
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,976
That's the four ounce
nugget we're all looking for!

248
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,436
- Yeah!
- -No, that's bigger than four ounces.

249
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,576
That's the biggest nugget in
gold rush history right there.

250
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,636
Now, we were talking
about, like, a $2,000 nugget,

251
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:07,736
- that's about a $15,000 or $20,000 nugget.
- -Yeah, dude.

252
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,736
That's gonna be a hard one to beat, man.

253
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,177
Yeah.

254
00:14:10,201 --> 00:14:12,976
Damn it, it's got Clay on it, doesn't it?

255
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,236
Yeah, it still does.

256
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,976
- My.
- My.

257
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,336
Nugget bend, man, it's owned its name.

258
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,336
- This is real, real.
- Yeah.

259
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,376
- This is happening for us.
- This is happening.

260
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,760
- My god. I mean... yeah.
- About damn time.

261
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,436
Holy stinkin' moly, man.

262
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,430
You see the size of that nugget?

263
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,430
I wish Fred was here to see that.

264
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,430
I literally do.

265
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,876
Amen. Amen. Amen.

266
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,660
Double amen.

267
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,660
Wow.

268
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,360
<i>Good livin's comin' from here on out.</i>

269
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,376
Got too excited with that big one,

270
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,976
forgot about all the babies?

271
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,430
- Yup. It's gonna be a good cleanup.
- Should be.

272
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,176
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

273
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,030
Yeah, dude.

274
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,330
We lost Fred.

275
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,436
He's the one that got us all here,

276
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,976
- but he's still here with us.
- He's helping us out.

277
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,430
I know he'd be so proud right now, so...

278
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:33,836
This is definitely the
high that we needed today.

279
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,436
We spent seven, eight
years just killing ourselves.

280
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:40,576
And now, we got this
badass nugget that just...

281
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,636
<i>Kinda like a trophy.</i>

282
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,876
We stuck it out. We put in the effort.

283
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,076
We finally figured out
where the right place

284
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,876
and the right technique to get down here.

285
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,436
We got this.

286
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,660
Now, let's do great.

287
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:58,360
Hell yeah. We freaking did it.

288
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,236
Hell yeah, fellas. Not a bad haul.

289
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,336
Not at all.

290
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,236
After nearly a decade of mining

291
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,236
<i>in the harshest environments,</i>

292
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,836
<i>Carlos' discovery is proof</i>

293
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,830
there's ancient gold here for the taking.

294
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,436
Good job, everybody. Way to stick it out.

295
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,436
They say that, definition of a winner

296
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,676
is someone that didn't
let losing stop them.

297
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,636
- Yup.
- And...

298
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,336
- Like that.
- We've lost a lot.

299
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,236
Yeah, we have.

300
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,776
- Not giving up.
- It's about damn time.

301
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,030
Set that baby on there
and let's see what it weighs.

302
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,236
Moment of truth.

303
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,730
Dun-dun-dun-dun dun-dun-dun.

304
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,836
- Wow.
- 5.8.

305
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,836
- Yeah!
- Dude, that's freaking... man!

306
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,036
Wow. Almost six ounces.

307
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,336
Hell yeah!

308
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,130
That might be $20,000, guaranteed.

309
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,176
For a specimen like that?

310
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:00,495
Yeah.

311
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,936
No, you don't get gold
like that for a gold price.

312
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,636
- That's gonna be almost double.
- Wow.

313
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,376
A nugget this big

314
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,636
<i>is worth far more than its weight in gold,</i>

315
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,436
<i>and could be just the beginning</i>

316
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,730
<i>of what nugget creek has to offer.</i>

317
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,436
Well, I went completely broke last year,

318
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,176
so this is a great start.

319
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,536
- It's a great start, isn't it?
- Yeah, it is.

320
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:25,976
That one nugget is more gold
than we did at our site last year.

321
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,836
There's no way there's
only one nugget like that

322
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,236
- in that whole freaking creek.
- No.

323
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,736
The whole deal is there
were stories up until today.

324
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,136
- Yeah.
- But it's reality for us now that

325
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,576
- there are big nuggets in this creek.
- -Yeah.

326
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,036
I absolutely guarantee it.

327
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,730
- I couldn't say that before.
- That's true.

328
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,636
Well, soak it up.

329
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,830
- We earned it.
- Yup.

330
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,436
I've gone bankrupt twice, almost,

331
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,736
trying to do this.

332
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,076
<i>It's finally gonna pay
for itself the right way.</i>

333
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,476
<i>- We're at the very beginning.
- The first 200 ft of the claim.</i>

334
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,036
I got a mile to go.

335
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,476
- This is it.
- We found it.

336
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,936
<i>We have arrived.</i>

337
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,730
I live for this.

338
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,736
Up ahead... Holy, man.

339
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,076
He's flanked by rock.

340
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,336
Hey, hey!

341
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,236
Everything above it.

342
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,076
Watch it. Watch it. Watch
it. Watch it. Watch it.

343
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,636
Watch, watch, watch, watch, watch!

344
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,160
He would've been dead!

345
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,636
Today, I'll be getting in the water.

346
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:37,836
Hopefully, I can get back
down to where Carlos was at.

347
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,536
Clean up that bedrock wall,

348
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,836
and see if we can't put a few more
of them six-ounce nuggets in the box.

349
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,436
At nugget camp,

350
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,876
<i>on the heels of their
biggest gold find ever,</i>

351
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:52,160
<i>expectations for another
record-breaking day are high.</i>

352
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,276
We are on the gold line right now.

353
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,836
We keep following it and,

354
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,830
get as much gold as we possibly can.

355
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,336
I have a good feeling
about the dive, dude.

356
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,676
We'll see gold.

357
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,336
We'll see lots of it today.

358
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,636
It should be something.

359
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,136
We'll get so much done today.

360
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,636
We're gonna get a lot done.

361
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,860
Whoo...

362
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,436
Hey, Paul?

363
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,377
Yeah?

364
00:19:23,401 --> 00:19:25,236
You got a couple solids on the bottom,

365
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,236
but everything on top is
getting dangerous, man.

366
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,536
Yeah.

367
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,976
So, I'll work all this,
we'll do some box checks,

368
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,636
and then I'll go over to the Weir.

369
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:37,136
The promise of more giant nuggets

370
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,430
<i>means Paul is ready
to put his life in danger</i>

371
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:45,276
<i>as he follows the center line up creek,</i>

372
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:50,100
<i>undermining the Weir, that
could trigger a fatal rock fall.</i>

373
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,030
All this undercut.

374
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:00,930
All this comes down, those
rocks are coming down right here.

375
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,460
This is where the diver's at.

376
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:12,636
It's always been one of my biggest
fears, is being trapped underwater.

377
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:16,536
So, if I end up undercutting it too much,

378
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,436
that'll be my permanent
home. I don't wanna do that.

379
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,736
Something lands on you,

380
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,060
- grab your mask and keep it on.
- Yeah.

381
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,736
- If that don't... Knock me out.
- If you can keep your mask on,

382
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,630
- we can get you out.
- Yeah.

383
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,076
I'll be right there.

384
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,500
Be certain of it.

385
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,236
- You tight?
- Nope, that feels good.

386
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,676
All right, brother. Good luck, man.

387
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,176
<i>Sense that six ounce!</i>

388
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,076
- I know, you set the bar high.
- I got my work ahead of me now.

389
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,636
<i>All right, man. Let's
find some more nugs?</i>

390
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,960
Yeah.

391
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,276
<i>- All righty.
- Where's the hole at?</i>

392
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,660
All right, here we go.

393
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,530
<i>Little bit of overburden down here, but...</i>

394
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,160
- It'll go back.
- Yeah, I think so.

395
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,936
Need you to think about big nuggets.

396
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,136
<i>If you get that image in your head, baby,</i>

397
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,676
<i>maybe you'd be, you know, direct into it.</i>

398
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,736
All right.

399
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,660
<i>I've got a vision of a big black nugget.</i>

400
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,560
James, is that bedrock right there?

401
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,430
- Right here?
- Yeah.

402
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,136
- It sure is.
- That is.

403
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,236
- Paul.
- Yeah?

404
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,836
That bedrock comes straight up this wall.

405
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,036
- Right up.
- Really? That's a waterfall.

406
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:48,036
This is a little waterfall and
that's the bottom of it right there.

407
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,836
- So this is a big Boulder?
- -Yes, that's what's going on.

408
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,813
I think we'll really get
gold catch. Whole nuggets.

409
00:21:53,837 --> 00:21:54,837
Yeah?

410
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,836
Every gold diver dreams of a plunge pool

411
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,860
<i>beneath an ancient waterfall.</i>

412
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,530
Hope it goes down deep.

413
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,130
And spotted with gold.

414
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,336
Yeah.

415
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,076
Paul, this is all wanting to slide right now.

416
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,376
- Copy that.
- It's moving by itself.

417
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,176
- And it's getting dangerous.
- All right.

418
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,436
Paul, just so you know,

419
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,236
Carlos is going to be
permanently on your line right now.

420
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:24,230
- Copy that.
- Got real, bro. It got real.

421
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,730
You know.

422
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,136
Things got crazy...

423
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,576
When you had to put a
tender on a diver's hose.

424
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:37,000
So when something happens, in an
instant, I have to pull the diver back.

425
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,330
Holy, man.

426
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,460
He's flanked by rocks.

427
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,460
Go! Go!

428
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,130
Damn it.

429
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,036
Stand back for a second. Hold on.

430
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,330
It's being undermined.
Let it settle for a second.

431
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,336
- All right.
- He's good to go?

432
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,060
- We're good to go.
- Yeah.

433
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,476
I'm on the bedrock wall, but

434
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,230
<i>I might almost be at the bottom.</i>

435
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,136
He's exactly on that
bedrock on that slope.

436
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,576
- Is he?
- That's where I was at.

437
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,736
That's where you
were getting the nuggs?

438
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,930
That's exactly where I left off at.

439
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,936
Hey, Paul, whatever that
is, it looks good in the box.

440
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,036
That's the color we're
looking for right there.

441
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,136
The next color after that is jet black.

442
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,230
So when we get this red and
jet black, there's always gold in it.

443
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,830
Come on, Paul. You can do it, baby.

444
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,236
You can do it, Paul.

445
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,636
- Yeah, man.
- That was the first good material

446
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,736
<i>you look like you put
across the box so far.</i>

447
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,836
- I've had it.
- -Do we look at the box?

448
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,560
- Go for it.
- Double it down.

449
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,730
Yeah, there's a piece right there.

450
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,976
Yep. Yep, yep, yep.

451
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,236
You got a few pieces for sure.

452
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,536
They're just underneath
the screen right now.

453
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,476
We gonna keep
adding. Just keep adding.

454
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,776
Do this, come back up.

455
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,576
- Copy that.
- You're on it.

456
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,560
You're on again. That's it.

457
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,976
Come on, man.

458
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,236
- Seven ounce nugget.
- Holy.

459
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,630
What are you doing?

460
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,230
Wow.

461
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,536
That's a weird color.

462
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,736
- It's root beer. Red root beer.
- Look at that.

463
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,336
Whatever you're doing,
just keep doing that.

464
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,836
- Copy that.
- Here's the black. Look at the black.

465
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,976
- The black... -holy.
- There it is.

466
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,736
- Black.
- Look at that.

467
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,336
Black gold. Check to see.

468
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,036
Watch it, watch it,
watch it, watch it, watch it.

469
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,430
Watch, watch, watch,
watch, watch, watch, watch...

470
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,736
You gotta be kidding me.

471
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,936
Sorry. You gotta back
up, back up, back up,

472
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,436
back up, back up. That
wall's coming down on you.

473
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,460
Just as he's getting on to something.

474
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,636
Finally, right?

475
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:02,576
- All right.
- Back at it.

476
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,136
Come on, Paul. Get me
some gold. Get me some gold.

477
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,936
Hey, Paul. Hey, Paul. The
whole thing's gonna go, dude.

478
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,736
That big Boulder, man,
it's starting to come down.

479
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,330
Paul, Paul, Paul, come on.

480
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,060
It's gonna fall in, man.

481
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,176
It's just getting more
and more dangerous.

482
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,636
This is about to get out of hand.

483
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:28,336
I gotta pull him out.

484
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,080
If they're gonna fall on your
head, it'll crush you like a damn bug.

485
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,336
Another three feet in there I can't see.

486
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,736
It's just too fast. It'll
be on you. We'll just go,

487
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,836
this is just freakin' freaking me out.

488
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,160
Let's double down.
Let's get the nozzle out.

489
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,236
Yeah, man.

490
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,030
That thing's coming
down right there, dude.

491
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,136
They know the gold is here.

492
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,076
<i>But it's just out of reach.</i>

493
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,476
<i>Less than two hours in,</i>

494
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,060
<i>Dustin won't let Paul push any further.</i>

495
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,060
At least there's two pickers.

496
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,030
You didn't see much?

497
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,736
- Anything?
- Nah.

498
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:22,436
Two little pieces. What a waste of a dive.

499
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,030
I didn't get a chance to do anything.

500
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,830
Frustrating...

501
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,330
To get pulled out every five minutes.

502
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,230
I guess they seeing a rock move, but...

503
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,660
It's annoying.

504
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,376
He's upset that we pulled him.

505
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,736
But, better than getting squashed.

506
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,676
It's that black rock up there. It
looked like it sagged a little bit

507
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,076
to that whole wall.

508
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,371
That might be one we
can knock in the morning.

509
00:26:55,395 --> 00:26:56,395
Yeah.

510
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:59,460
Make it, safe for James.

511
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,460
I don't wanna dive in that.

512
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,530
- Kidding me?
- That unstable.

513
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,060
Are we that stupid or what the going on?

514
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,536
- Try not to get so frustrated.
- Yeah.

515
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,076
You get upset with something
and you gonna get yourself killed.

516
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,460
And you'll be like, "that's
what they were bitching about."

517
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,760
- And here we go.
- Holy.

518
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,436
That would have killed you.

519
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,776
That would have got your legs. You
legs were up. Your legs were there.

520
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,136
Yeah.

521
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,836
We'd be trying to pull it
off your legs right now.

522
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,736
A half ton widow maker

523
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:37,436
<i>just dropped under the spot
right where Paul was diving.</i>

524
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,736
I'd rather you be mad
than dead or pinned.

525
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,076
- I get it.
- -Go ahead and get mad.

526
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,176
Yeah, man. You would
have been peg legged, dude.

527
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,836
That was like some,
wild ass timing right there.

528
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,836
That ain't no lie.

529
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,176
You could have kept dredging
and that would have happened.

530
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,630
He would have been dead.

531
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,160
And now they're laughing about it.

532
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,036
Is that rock on top of this?

533
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,976
- I bet you that rock...
- that rock was on top of it.

534
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,036
- That rock's on top of it.
- All right.

535
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:09,136
Great call, guys. Great call.

536
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,336
He'd have been on
the end of that nozzle,

537
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,060
right there pinned, and we'd
have been trying to get him out.

538
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,460
I never saw that danger.

539
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,376
Not once.

540
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,336
You guys had my back. I appreciate that.

541
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,436
- You saved my life, dude.
- Dude. Man.

542
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,236
- That's... that's us.
- Yeah.

543
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:34,836
It's nice knowing as a diver that you
can trust your team to keep you safe.

544
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,360
We're just... we're one
big family here, so...

545
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:42,636
Credit to those guys. They saved my life.

546
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:47,236
White water gold mining is
like a game of high-stakes poker.

547
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:52,976
<i>The chance of life-changing
gold could cost you everything.</i>

548
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,030
I ain't diving in that hole tomorrow.

549
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,160
No. He could fire me.

550
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,036
It's my turn in the rotation to dive.

551
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:16,536
<i>And, I did not sleep at all last night.</i>

552
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,536
I knew that rock was gonna come down.

553
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,136
I'd just seen it. I had visions of it.

554
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,830
Visions of it being the worst day...

555
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,136
Of him getting crushed
and we can't get him out.

556
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,636
<i>Broken ribs, smashed head.</i>

557
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,330
That was all going through my mind.

558
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,330
I just don't want to die.

559
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,060
Is the gold worth it?

560
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,336
Dustin and his crew have proven

561
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,776
<i>there's life-changing
gold in nugget creek.</i>

562
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,630
<i>But to get to it, they'll have
to put their lives on the line.</i>

563
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:11,860
We got to a place where we
can no longer be safe and dive.

564
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,136
The guys are scared.

565
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,960
They should be. Paul almost died.

566
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,976
Well...

567
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,930
Now I'm filling in the hole that
we've been digging for days.

568
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,760
This sucks.

569
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,536
To move forward at nugget bend

570
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:32,036
<i>and clean out every ounce
of gold from the plunge pool.</i>

571
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:35,230
<i>Dustin and his crew must
take a major step back.</i>

572
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,836
Hole's getting filled in. Hell lot of work.

573
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,036
Start, start, start again.

574
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:45,230
But the upside... it's safer.

575
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:00,436
That sound is the
scariest sound in the world.

576
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:04,036
Especially, when the
diver's at the receiving end.

577
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,230
My job is to keep everybody safe here.

578
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,836
I'm not the safety guy.

579
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:13,430
, I've become the safety guy. My
god, I've become the safety guy.

580
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,060
How the hell did I
become the safety guy?

581
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,830
I gotta keep these guys
alive. That's all there is to it.

582
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,676
We'll anchor this one back to that.

583
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,636
- To that chain?
- We'll tie that one off.

584
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,636
- Maybe tie that one off.
- That one?

585
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:34,136
We'll anchor this one back
and then that big one down there,

586
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,760
we'll anchor it back as well.

587
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,736
We're gonna start pulling all
those boulders back downstream,

588
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:44,036
so, we can get a diver in
and get back on the gold.

589
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,341
Dude, we can put the basket
there and drop them right in.

590
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,060
There you go.

591
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,330
Woo-hoo.

592
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,930
Friggin' send it.

593
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,430
- I love it, dude.
- That thing's badass.

594
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,736
Run another cable here,

595
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,836
up over that way, makes the perfect y.

596
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:20,230
Should hold this rock in place
and all this will stay right there.

597
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,060
Better to be too safe than not safe.

598
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,836
What do you think, James?

599
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:29,836
- That one is not a big risk but...
- -Nope.

600
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:32,130
These three are all tagged up.

601
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,260
All right. Well, I'll get suited up.

602
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:41,736
If gets in there, he can get to the
bottom where I was at yesterday.

603
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,659
We gotta remember
it's gonna rain tonight...

604
00:32:43,683 --> 00:32:43,976
Yup.

605
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,371
So, we have no idea
what to expect tomorrow.

606
00:32:46,395 --> 00:32:47,176
That's true.

607
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,636
This might be the only
chance we get for that thing.

608
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:55,536
Now that it's mitigated, Boulder's
all tethered up, I feel safe.

609
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:59,060
That six ounce nugget is stirring
up gold fever for everybody.

610
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,060
We can't leave the
hole without finishing it.

611
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,836
<i>I need to do this by the numbers.</i>

612
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,476
<i>I need you to do yardage.</i>

613
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,776
<i>Get the yardage out of
there, make sure it's clean.</i>

614
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,436
<i>Slick it, slick it, slick it and when
we run out we run out, all right?</i>

615
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,976
<i>Okay, copy that. Yup.</i>

616
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,676
I appreciate you going in.

617
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,630
All right, James, you're
good to go, amigo.

618
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,476
- How is your vis?
- It's about a foot.

619
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,530
<i>- Foot-and-a-half.
- All right.</i>

620
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,336
Top get back to the pay layer

621
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,576
<i>that held the six ounce nugget.</i>

622
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,876
<i>James must first remove all the material</i>

623
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,060
<i>they washed into their hole.</i>

624
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:56,536
Also, don't forget, you're gonna
have a giant black rock down there.

625
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,836
- That's the rock that almost got him.
- -Man.

626
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,230
That's your rock, Paul.

627
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,560
- Yeah.
- The rock's pretty big.

628
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,536
<i>I can't even get my arms
all the way around 'em.</i>

629
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,636
What are you thinking?

630
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:11,060
- How about a choker?
- Choker?

631
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,530
Yeah!

632
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,830
- Good wrap, James.
- Good wrap.

633
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,076
Holy.

634
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,330
Holy moly, Paul. That's yours.

635
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,330
I'll get it right here to the shore.

636
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,860
- My god.
- Holy moly.

637
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,930
Holy.

638
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,330
That's half my body.

639
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:48,076
- Wow!
- That is half of my body.

640
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,676
Hey, man, that would've
hurt, I ain't gonna lie.

641
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,436
- Yeah.
- I don't think he would've felt it, man.

642
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,460
That would've had me from head to tail.

643
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:02,376
Hey, you remember the
rock that almost killed you?

644
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,336
- Yeah.
- This is it.

645
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:09,136
At nugget bend Paul comes
face-to-face with the widow-maker

646
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,136
<i>that nearly ended his life.</i>

647
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,236
That's the goddamn meteorite

648
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,060
- that killed the dinosaurs, bro.
- -Yup.

649
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,636
That would've ended my life.

650
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:20,076
I would still be in the bottom of that hole.

651
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,260
There would be a
body recovery going on.

652
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,160
Holy.

653
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:38,730
So, I need dredge a little bit
right here till I find that wall.

654
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:42,476
Over five hours into his dive.

655
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:46,336
<i>James is still searching for
more of the six ounce nuggets</i>

656
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,660
<i>that nugget creek has proven to hold.</i>

657
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,636
<i>Let's find the bottom of that bedrock wall.</i>

658
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:55,976
<i>It already warmed up today and
that water's gonna come up again,</i>

659
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,636
<i>and then that wall's
gonna start caving in again.</i>

660
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,412
<i>Let's get...</i>

661
00:36:00,436 --> 00:36:02,930
Let's get everything
we can get done today.

662
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,800
Not sure but.

663
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,736
James, you find gold?

664
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,960
Sitting in the crack on
the side of the bedrock.

665
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:18,660
My god! Whoa!

666
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,030
Look at that.

667
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,630
I love it.

668
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,636
- That's the pretty stuff?
- It is.

669
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:31,060
- I love that patina on there.
- Ruby gold, man.

670
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,230
That's beautiful.

671
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,930
<i>- That's amazing.
- We're on to it now.</i>

672
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,160
<i>Hopefully, there's more.</i>

673
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,836
Make it spotless, man.

674
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,536
And, I see everything down there now.

675
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,930
- Lick it all, man.
- Lick it all.

676
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,536
I know.

677
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,436
- He's just like, "hey. Look at this."
- "Look."

678
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,630
"Yup, there it is."

679
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,936
Good looking stuff.

680
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,976
I just... I think what I'm looking for now is

681
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,430
- that pile of six ounce nuggets.
- -Yeah.

682
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,776
We're spoiled.

683
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,676
All right, I'm just about
done with that hole.

684
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,476
<i>I got one minute left.</i>

685
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,576
James was freaking out all yesterday,

686
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,736
but as soon as he gets
in the water, man, it just...

687
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,736
- It all goes away.
- It does.

688
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,976
I think that's it.

689
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,830
<i>The bedrock channel rises up
in front of me just before the Weir.</i>

690
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,630
<i>It's a dead-end, man.</i>

691
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,436
Over the last two months.

692
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,736
<i>Dustin and his crew have dredged</i>

693
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,030
<i>through 100 feet of prime
big nugget real estate</i>

694
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:41,136
<i>and cleared nearly 200 tons of boulders</i>

695
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,330
<i>as they chase the gold line.</i>

696
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:47,936
<i>Now, James has dredged the hole clean</i>

697
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:52,060
<i>and the rising bedrock
signals the end of the line.</i>

698
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,730
The hole's done.

699
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,576
<i>This hole is done.</i>

700
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,136
- Good deal.
- Can we do a double down right quick

701
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,176
<i>and check and see what's in there?</i>

702
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,560
- Yeah.
- Okay.

703
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:12,160
I'd be blown away if
there's nothing in the bottom.

704
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,476
<i>I don't see anything in here.</i>

705
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,436
- Wow.
- Gold does weird things.

706
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,936
I don't get it, man.

707
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,276
Well, I'm glad you got that six ounce
nugget out 'cause it shows something.

708
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,336
<i>I think we tap this thing out, man.</i>

709
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,636
- Yeah.
- -That might be all of it, man.

710
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,936
If you're good, I'm good.

711
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,730
<i>- I'MMA call it then. Good?
- Yeah.</i>

712
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,936
I need to hear it.

713
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,107
<i>Do you think there's
any more gold down here?</i>

714
00:38:51,131 --> 00:38:51,536
No.

715
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,976
<i>All right. Time to move on.</i>

716
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,930
<i>- Let's pack, then.
- All right.</i>

717
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,636
Good dive, man. Good dive. Tapped out.

718
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,176
On to bigger and better gold, man.

719
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,236
- That's true.
- That's it. Moving on.

720
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:06,836
It's beyond me why there
wasn't a pot of gold at the bottom.

721
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:09,236
Gold is where you find it.

722
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:13,160
I think we can leave this spot knowing
that we didn't leave anything behind.

723
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:18,576
After eight hard weeks,
dredging 12 ounces

724
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,436
<i>of the biggest nuggets they've ever found</i>

725
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:27,330
<i>the empty sluice box shows it's time
to move on to the next opportunity.</i>

726
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,476
Finally getting gold.

727
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:34,336
The only thing that's
been missing in my life

728
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,736
is more gold and we're getting there.

729
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:41,630
<i>Not as much as I wanted but nugget
bend produced a six ounce nugget.</i>

730
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:45,636
<i>I can only imagine what's
about to happen for us.</i>

731
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:50,036
<i>- This is gonna be our best year, ever.
- It already is.</i>

732
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,930
It's already our best year.

733
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,630
This is awesome.

734
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,630
Up ahead, this season...

735
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,976
We're done with you!

736
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,460
Time for us to move on!

737
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,276
This is gonna be a challenge again.

738
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,630
This is the rematch.

739
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,630
<i>We got a solid plan.</i>

740
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,260
<i>And we have to win or
else we're done for, y'all.</i>

741
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,736
Welcome to my nightmare.

742
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,500
Almost got killed just now.

743
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,636
- Hurry up. Come on.
- Lift. Come on.

744
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,660
Help me lift this mother.

745
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,660
<i>This place is trying to kill us... Holy.</i>

746
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,236
Are we gonna let it?

747
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,200
<i>- You all right, man?
- You look beet red.</i>

748
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,660
I'll let you know.

749
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:48,000
<i>I'd like to see what our future's gonna be.</i>

750
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,376
I swear I can hear a waterfall.

751
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,436
Now, that's a waterfall, man.

752
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,176
Holy, dude.

753
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,076
Looks like it's holding a bunch of gold.

754
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,676
Get that gold! Woo-hoo!

755
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:00,760
There it is!

756
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,676
Holy.

757
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,176
What would you sell this for, man?

758
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,030
$60,000 or $70,000.

759
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,436
About damn time, man.

760
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:13,136
We know there's big gold.
All we gotta do is go get it.

761
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,976
We're dredging!

762
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,400
<i>I got something for ya.</i>

763
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:21,576
This place is gonna pay
for the rest of my damn life.

764
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,436
My god!

765
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:24,730
That's beautiful.

766
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,460
<i>Finally, we made it.</i>
