1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,866
Deep in the Alaskan wilderness.

2
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,036
This year, we got
something to prove.

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,976
- Extreme gold miner Dustin hurt...
- Let's go.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,696
- Leads his crew of fearless miners...
- Whoo!

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,766
To the most remote
claims on earth

6
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,006
I feel like the guys
are hungry right now.

7
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,526
Hunting for nuggets where
no one else would dare.

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,976
Really hungry. I'm loving it.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Good to go.

10
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,620
Diver in.

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,176
Risking everything...

12
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,386
- Get out of there!
- Watch the swing.

13
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:39,410
Do or die, amigo.

14
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,820
He would have been dead.

15
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,930
This is still not how I die.

16
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,656
- For the big score...
- There's gonna be giant nugget

17
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,030
just about 10 feet down.

18
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,556
This season, they
finally hit the jackpot.

19
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,006
- Nugget!
- My god!

20
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,906
Everything we've heard is true.

21
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,790
There is so much
gold down there.

22
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,440
Breaking the record books...

23
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,620
That's the biggest
nugget in gold rush history.

24
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,176
But face a catastrophe...

25
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,060
Hey, guys, I have some bad news.

26
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,036
No one is ready for...

27
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,130
Never known life
without Fred hurt.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,386
- Yeah.
- You guys ready for this?

29
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,246
- Yeah.
- We don't have to set up camp.

30
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,456
We don't have to move anything.

31
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,866
We go in there,
open everything up,

32
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,146
get the dredge out,
get up creek and go.

33
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,696
In remote southeast Alaska,

34
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,006
veteran gold miner Dustin
hurt and his band of brothers

35
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,386
are heading deep into
the Alaskan wilderness.

36
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:59,486
Let's get some good gold, guys.

37
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:04,440
On a mission to start mining
operations earlier than ever before.

38
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,370
And I can't find the
tent or the camp.

39
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,346
Did you see it?

40
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:13,386
By the way, you can't
see anything right here.

41
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,216
I got to figure out how
to get on top of this stuff.

42
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,656
We can find the right ledge.
We can probably do that.

43
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,796
Y'all ready for that?

44
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,860
Yeah.

45
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,556
We're probably going to run
over a whole bunch of rocks,

46
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,740
so everybody don't trip over.

47
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,860
Whoa!

48
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,216
Come on.

49
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,000
Whoa. What the was that?

50
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,510
- We're not going to make it!
- We're not going to make it!

51
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,076
My god! That was insane!

52
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,656
That's not my intention.

53
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,906
I thought hopefully I could
get up on top of the snow

54
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,596
and maybe it would go.

55
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,386
All the ledges, look how
tall all the ledges are.

56
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,340
We're so close to camp.

57
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,596
30 miles north of
the nearest town

58
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,170
lies Dustin's mining
camp at nugget creek.

59
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,176
He sunk his life
savings into buying it,

60
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,076
but getting there is a risky
nine-mile journey up the sercu river.

61
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,076
The dangerous access
is why it's rumored

62
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,936
to still have legendary
chunky nuggets.

63
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,416
We have to freaking take
all this snow out, dude.

64
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,456
All right, let's get the
shovels, and we got

65
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,130
- to get some of the weight out.
- Yeah.

66
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:41,076
We're trying to find a water track for the
air boat to ride on all the way to camp.

67
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,346
And what it looks
like is it got too narrow,

68
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:48,006
and we started busting
through snow, and I got us stuck.

69
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,906
The whole point of
getting up here early

70
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:54,216
was so we could get digging before
the rain comes and floods us out.

71
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,146
But right now, we can't
even make it to camp.

72
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,246
I knew we'd be digging
snow, but I didn't think

73
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,796
- we'd be digging snow out of the boat.
- No.

74
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,650
Dude, that was
crazy even for me.

75
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,310
My god.

76
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,246
Sorry, guys, I tried.

77
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,626
We got most of the way.
If we can just get this out.

78
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,680
Well, it was too
narrow, obviously.

79
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,866
We got no choice, man.

80
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,200
We have to follow this.

81
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:21,346
It's not looking good
for us making it to camp,

82
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:25,386
which we could see camp,
but I can't get up on these banks.

83
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,750
I'm going to keep
trying, though.

84
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,176
So I'm wondering if I should
cut y'all loose, go by myself,

85
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,341
and try to jump up on
top without killing us?

86
00:04:36,365 --> 00:04:36,836
Yeah.

87
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,866
And then try to come get
you if I can ride on the snow.

88
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,696
You ready to push out?

89
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,526
Let's go for a shove.

90
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,936
All this is just
gonna slide off.

91
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,726
We're gonna turn it on and...

92
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,176
There we go. Ready?

93
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,200
Yep.

94
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,620
- All right, up.
- Watch yourself.

95
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,386
- We made it!
- Holy, we made it.

96
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,486
We made it! Yeah!

97
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:24,146
- No way!
- Yeah!

98
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,130
I knew I should have stayed on.

99
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:31,000
- What are you doing, Carlos?
- Trying to get up on the shelf.

100
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,836
Woo-hoo! Yeah!

101
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,440
- Hell yeah!
- I didn't think I was going to make it.

102
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,680
Let's go jump some.

103
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,240
Yeah, Carlos.

104
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,246
Woo!

105
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,890
Let's get to the other side now.

106
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,766
I agree.

107
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,680
All right, let's get a camp.

108
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,656
Look, we were so close
to the gold last year.

109
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,316
It's driving me crazy,
knowing what we left out there.

110
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,526
I just grabbed the dredge
and just yank it up there

111
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,766
and start dredging.

112
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,270
That's all I want to do, too.

113
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,006
Woo-hoo! We got this down.

114
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,720
We're crash-test dummies.

115
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,906
- Whoo!
- We're here, boys!

116
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,726
Back at nugget creek.

117
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,316
Let's get in the water.

118
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:28,176
Last year, Dustin shifted
his focus to the remote

119
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,790
and inhospitable
nugget creek claim,

120
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:37,580
rumored to hold nuggets
worth up to $50,000 apiece.

121
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,006
The word is that nugget
creek has more gold up there

122
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,030
than I can handle.

123
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:47,036
More gold and bigger gold.

124
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,626
That's promising.

125
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:52,340
With a little bit of luck, this
could change our entire lives.

126
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,596
But those dreams quickly
turned to nightmares

127
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:03,176
when his two crews were annihilated
by a series of ferocious storms.

128
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,556
That is so loud.

129
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,866
You can hear the boulders
rolling down the creek.

130
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:10,416
Sound like I'm in a Texas
thunderstorm right now.

131
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,176
We're about to lose everything,

132
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,160
and there's nothing I can
do but watch it happen.

133
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,030
This place is destroyed.

134
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,906
I'MMA call in the
season. That's it.

135
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,100
We're done with this.

136
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:30,286
Mother nature beat us last year.

137
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:33,176
After all that flooding, it
destroyed my bank account,

138
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,486
- I can tell you that.
- Yeah.

139
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:38,836
And it was a choice between
completely stopping this

140
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,246
or basically going
to debt to do this.

141
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,866
So I went into debt to do
this, and this is where we're at.

142
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:47,286
Couldn't afford to bring
everybody back, so this is it.

143
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,626
This is us. We either
weren't going to come back,

144
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,456
or we're going to have a
single crew, and that's it.

145
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,286
And I decided on us.

146
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,286
We're going to have to
hit it as hard as we can

147
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,456
- because we know the rains are coming.
- We got to.

148
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,696
We got to make up for
what we didn't do last year.

149
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,906
That's true.

150
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:05,416
Dustin is down to
just a five-person crew.

151
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,036
And to make matters
worse, he will have to face

152
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,580
the season ahead without
his most trusted ally.

153
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:21,246
I have to find out
how Fred's doing.

154
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:25,416
They just diagnosed him
with severe brain cancer.

155
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,246
Quite frankly, I think
that this is probably going

156
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,750
to be the last time I see him.

157
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,060
Um...

158
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,346
We'll see.

159
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,316
It's pretty sad to
say that out loud.

160
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:39,510
I think that's the first time I've
really, really said that out loud.

161
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,866
Mining legend, Dakota Fred

162
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:50,620
brought his son, Dustin, to
Alaska over 10 years ago.

163
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:53,866
They can go on by, baby.

164
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:58,386
The two mined side by
side, sharing good times

165
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:03,486
- 280 ounces of gold.
- Yeah!

166
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,796
Hell yeah.

167
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,766
And bad.

168
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,216
What the hell are you doing?

169
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,726
That does not sound like
condescending bull to you?

170
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,346
But nothing could stand
between father and son

171
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:19,556
and their dream of
a bonanza in gold.

172
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,836
Hey, Fred, can you believe it?

173
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,456
We're both diving in
McKinley creek together.

174
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,936
Double the dredges,
double the hurts.

175
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:32,100
But Fred's recent diagnosis
changed everything.

176
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:40,556
- Hey, Fred.
- Hey, what's up, man?

177
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,860
How's it going, man?

178
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,486
- Good to see you.
- Yeah.

179
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,960
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

180
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,246
So how you doing, man?

181
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,580
I guess you know I got...

182
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,270
Good old brain tumors right now.

183
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,456
My balance is down a little bit.

184
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,596
A little bit of blurry vision.

185
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,370
It's progressing every day.

186
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,286
Sorry to hear that, brother.

187
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,310
That's too bad.

188
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,720
So how long did they give you?

189
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,486
They don't know.

190
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:28,790
I mean, anywhere from a
few months to six months.

191
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:36,750
I know you're concerned,
and I know it bothers you.

192
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,580
Hell, I've lived a good life.

193
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,820
Yeah.

194
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,696
We're gonna miss
you up there, man.

195
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,060
Everybody likes
having you around.

196
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:55,106
I want you guys to go up there
and have one hell of a season.

197
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:59,766
I know you got a good plan,
and I'll be rooting for you.

198
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,766
Hopefully, you
make it long enough

199
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:05,866
to where we can
show you some gold.

200
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,216
- I'll be looking forward to it.
- Okay.

201
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,866
That's my goal.

202
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:13,106
To hold out long
enough to see some gold

203
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,480
come out of nugget creek.

204
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,286
So, bring me some.

205
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:21,866
I'm gonna try with all
my might, but, yeah.

206
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,346
- All right.
- All right.

207
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:25,510
Love you. You take care.

208
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,146
I love you.

209
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,550
Hope we get to see you again.

210
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,480
Pretty damn sad.

211
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,480
I've never known
life without Fred hurt.

212
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,036
Nobody's ever ready
to let somebody go.

213
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,726
You just deal with
it when it happens.

214
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,750
That's it.

215
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,930
- Love you, hon.
- I love you, too.

216
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,936
I'm heading up to
Alaska with his blessing.

217
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,286
He wants me to succeed.

218
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:16,620
He wants me to find gold.

219
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:20,416
He wants me to have adventure.

220
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,100
He doesn't want me sitting
here watching him die.

221
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,486
So, it's gonna
be a little rough.

222
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,836
Snow's a little deep.

223
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,526
The things that we
do to go for this gold,

224
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:49,456
it's a 1,000-foot hike through
deep snow to their camp,

225
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,976
which they left under wraps

226
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,820
through the harsh
Alaskan winter.

227
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,580
. He found a spot.

228
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,976
Gotta catch a breath.

229
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:07,006
That's destroyed.

230
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:10,726
That's not good.

231
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,000
That's not what I wanted to see.

232
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,836
To give themselves
a head start this year,

233
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,286
the crew left all
their mining gear

234
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:25,170
in a steel-reinforced tent to
protect it from the elements.

235
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,656
Everything is under snow.

236
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,286
Our tent, our buggies,
the dredges are buried.

237
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,680
This mother was
supposed to be snow proof.

238
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,656
This was a big setback.

239
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,316
Yet again, I messed up.

240
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,170
I bought the wrong
tent, obviously.

241
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,680
And now we're set back.

242
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,906
Um...

243
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:50,596
The most perfect day to
go out and start dredging,

244
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,626
and I'm not out there.

245
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:54,580
I'm picking up the damn mess.

246
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,000
Did we lose everything?

247
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,596
On our first day, it's a
rescue mission for all our gear.

248
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:18,006
Phase one, find out
what's in this destroyed tent.

249
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:21,696
At Dustin's nugget camp,
the collapsed storage tent

250
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,036
threatens to derail their
early start to the season.

251
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:29,836
We had an idea right
before the end of last season,

252
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:36,006
put up a nice tent rated for freaking,
kind of, buku snow, like arctic snow.

253
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:38,486
And we thought we would
come back this season

254
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,480
with all our gear
nice and toasty,

255
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,790
obviously,

256
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:44,720
snow wins.

257
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,416
That's slick. Whoa.

258
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,346
- Dang it.
- It's like a maze in here.

259
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:54,510
I can't move.

260
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,030
I'm literally stuck.

261
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,006
Solid ice down here, too.

262
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:03,216
- We need this snow out.
- Gotcha.

263
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,106
There's a shovel
right here, James.

264
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,620
- Boy.
- Can you get over here?

265
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,286
Can you reach it?

266
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:12,051
You have to bring it back
to where you were before.

267
00:15:12,075 --> 00:15:13,075
Okay.

268
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,960
Good job, dude!

269
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,246
Get out of town!

270
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,286
It's not even about
trying to beat the rains.

271
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,766
I need my gear to be okay.

272
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,486
If it's smashed and all of
my dredges are destroyed,

273
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,106
we're done. We're done here.

274
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,866
We got to just go,
because I can't afford

275
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,456
to replace all this stuff.

276
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,750
It's just not going to happen.

277
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:45,106
All right, I'm going to see if
I can get the dozer running

278
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:47,526
and start cleaning out some
of the snow around the camp.

279
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:50,386
Hell, yeah. There's a lot.

280
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,036
I mean, we can
work at it and get it.

281
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,680
- Yeah, man.
- Arnold.

282
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,510
Yeah!

283
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,076
Yeah! Fired right up!

284
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,796
Well, the dozer
started right up,

285
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,130
so that's a good sign already.

286
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,726
That means we
can get rid of snow.

287
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,100
It's a big deal here.

288
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:20,726
Getting rid of snow
is always a plus.

289
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:25,316
Dustin gets to work clearing
the snow, while inside the tent,

290
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:28,246
there's a
search-and-rescue mission.

291
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,936
There's a lot of snow on top.

292
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,620
I'm going to go
to the other end.

293
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:37,146
- Jeep got up, too.
- Did it?

294
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,170
Yep.

295
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,416
Yeah, the windshield.

296
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,106
Dude, it popped the tires.

297
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,766
- Yeah.
- Bad.

298
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,316
Holy.

299
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,216
- That crushed in the whole roof.
- My god.

300
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,696
I don't even know if
we should be in here.

301
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,216
They're crushed.

302
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,656
Holy moly, dude.

303
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,860
That's not good, bro.

304
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,000
That's not going to happen.

305
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,316
The tires are popped...

306
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,580
- All our vehicles are done for.
- From all the weight.

307
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,346
Well, they're going
to need a lot of work.

308
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,076
Who's going to be the
first one to tell Dustin?

309
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,340
Not me, amigo.

310
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,906
- How's it going over there?
- It smashed everything.

311
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:19,000
They digged up the
atv. It's smashed too.

312
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:21,106
Somewhat.

313
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:24,240
The whole bed is
crushed to the ground.

314
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,866
I can't tell on the axles yet.

315
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:30,316
I can't get over
there to actually see.

316
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:34,416
We'll just have to assess it once
we can get some of that off of there.

317
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,016
Let me take a look. I
haven't looked in here yet.

318
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,416
Yep. Okay.

319
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,960
I've been out here
playing in the mud.

320
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,866
The excavator's fine, but
I need to take that bar off

321
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:45,036
down there before I
can get the excavator out.

322
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,440
Can we maybe get
it out of the tent, or...

323
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,836
- Yeah.
- Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

324
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,500
- Don't you think it's smashed up?
- Yeah.

325
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,240
Yeah.

326
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,270
It took it pretty roughly.

327
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,246
Don't get in here.
There ain't no reason.

328
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,626
- Just let it happen.
- Okay, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.

329
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,000
Don't get in here.

330
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,596
Ooh, it's got me pinned.

331
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,076
- Wow.
- What do you need?

332
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,030
- Balls.
- There you go.

333
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,106
- Um...
- It might come.

334
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:22,720
Just let us get out
of the way and...

335
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,930
Okay, you're good.

336
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,650
- Free at last.
- You got it.

337
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,146
All right. Let's
pull this Jeep out,

338
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,170
see what's left of it.

339
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,310
Sit tight.

340
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,310
Keep driving.

341
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:48,386
- Watch your fingers and toes.
- Go for it.

342
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:50,240
- I'm about to bounce on you.
- Go for it.

343
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,340
Ooh.

344
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:55,796
. Wow.

345
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,820
She's in there.

346
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:01,270
Carlos, James, come hang
off the back of this thing, man.

347
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,580
Yeah!

348
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:09,820
- Okay. Here goes.
- There it goes!

349
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,836
Yeah!

350
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,036
Thank you, guys.

351
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,416
, man, it's so
apocalyptic, dude.

352
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,796
That poor Jeep.

353
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,936
Let's get the atvs out.

354
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,410
We might have a flat tire.

355
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:25,440
It's alive!

356
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:30,216
Yeah!

357
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,146
You don't even
need to tow it, dude.

358
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:34,836
- It works.
- Holy.

359
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,176
- That's a good sign.
- Yeah, it is.

360
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:41,486
I thought that thing
was trashed completely.

361
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:44,316
It's all wonky, but
god, man, it still goes.

362
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,906
That tire flat on the front?

363
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:48,216
Man, I bet you
that ice came down,

364
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,626
just pushed the air out of that.

365
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,386
- Yeah.
- We're trying to get to this dry spot.

366
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:54,006
That thing was pancake.

367
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:56,626
You couldn't tell if it
was going to drive or not.

368
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,456
It looked like it was toast.

369
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,286
Now we got an atv we can drive.

370
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,030
We'll be able to get
around in the snow.

371
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:05,386
That's a huge win
for us right now.

372
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:07,656
- So...
- Yes, it is.

373
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,726
- Takes a licking, keeps on ticking.
- Right.

374
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,526
How are the dredges
looking over there?

375
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,036
Did they make it?

376
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,596
You know what?

377
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,486
All the dredges
are on this side,

378
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,270
and they all look just fine.

379
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:21,346
I cannot believe that made it.

380
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:22,696
That is awesome, man.

381
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,626
The one thing that it
didn't smash is my dredges.

382
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:29,656
They made it, and
it was just blind luck.

383
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,596
- That was it.
- Hang on, hang on.

384
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,486
The dredges got pontoons
and we've got snow.

385
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:36,486
Why don't we try to
stage that dredge?

386
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,866
- You want to drag it up on the snow?
- Drag it up with the atv.

387
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:40,316
Then it's just a short
jog to get it to the site.

388
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,836
Yeah, we can stage it.

389
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,486
Tell you what, right now, we need
to finish getting our cabins fixed up.

390
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,936
Yes, then we can
go check it out.

391
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,146
So first thing tomorrow,
we'll get the tracks on that atv,

392
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:51,656
and we'll drag that
dredge up to the creek.

393
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,930
That's a great idea, Paul.

394
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:57,310
Hopefully, we can
get minin' real soon.

395
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,036
Well, you slept hard, cos
I could hear you snoring.

396
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,596
- Yeah, I slept hard.
- You didn't wake up at all?

397
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:15,796
I woke up at 1 o'clock.

398
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:18,486
It was still dark. I
had to take a piss.

399
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,556
Then that freaking light,
Paul's light came on.

400
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,286
I said, thank you, god, man.

401
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,976
Check it out. I've got
something cool to show you.

402
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,130
It's in a map.

403
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:32,216
- And it's from 1928.
- Wow.

404
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,510
This is the known
perimeters of our claim

405
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:39,626
if you go on the online stuff,

406
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:42,456
it is different than
the original stuff.

407
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,836
I got a hold of
the original stuff,

408
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:48,766
and this is... This
is our boundaries.

409
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:53,076
And what I've been told is
we, and this kind of proves it,

410
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:58,626
that we're about 200
to 300 feet upstream,

411
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,370
too far, what we thought
was our property line.

412
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:05,216
Dustin spent the
whole of last season

413
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,726
battling at what he thought was
the southernmost limit of his claim.

414
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,386
But the 1928 survey map

415
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:17,440
has revealed that his boundary
extends 250 feet further down creek,

416
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:23,170
gifting him the potential
of new gold-rich territory.

417
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:26,936
So I'm pretty psyched
about this map, guys.

418
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,696
- Yeah. Me too.
- And what it did for us,

419
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,286
I think it's a good spot to dig.

420
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,006
Last year, we had
to walk right by it,

421
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,513
because I thought it
wasn't on our property.

422
00:22:34,537 --> 00:22:34,766
Yeah.

423
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:37,766
But it's within our
reach to dig there.

424
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:40,146
It's a good settling area for
ancient gold that came down.

425
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:41,106
Yep.

426
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,346
And it settled there,
and everything else

427
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,316
smoothed off on the other side.

428
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,976
- That's freaking awesome, dude.
- Come on.

429
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,316
You see, the way I see it,
too, big boulders, big gold.

430
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,976
You know, if the big
boulders stopped right there,

431
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,246
the big gold's gonna
drop out right there.

432
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,146
It's gonna be it, man.
Nugget patch, bro.

433
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,286
Just picking them up and
putting them in your basket.

434
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,626
I haven't seen any damn gold.

435
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:57,416
- Man.
- There's no speculation until I see it.

436
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,796
- Yeah.
- Right, right, right.

437
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,726
This is not real until we
actually hold it in our hands.

438
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:02,766
- Yeah.
- Exactly.

439
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,906
So we can talk about
how much we're gonna get,

440
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:08,146
but the truth is, if
we don't beat the rain,

441
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,796
it's all for nothing anyways.
So we have to beat it.

442
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,237
Yeah.

443
00:23:11,261 --> 00:23:14,036
We have to be to the
bottom of this thing.

444
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,216
No time wasted. We
have to get up there.

445
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,216
We have to smash this.

446
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,626
Just absolutely dig it out.

447
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:22,696
Just... Just everything you can.

448
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,976
And then when it's flooding,
you can take your break.

449
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,036
- All right?
- Yep.

450
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,596
All right. Everybody know
what they were doing?

451
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,680
All right.

452
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:32,216
Man, I can't wait to go mining.

453
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,656
Last year, we found out
how hard it was to drag

454
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,526
these dredges up to the creek.

455
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:41,246
So we need to put
tracks on this atv.

456
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:43,890
We're going to put these
dredges on the snow

457
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,796
and slide them right up.

458
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,176
We want to take
advantage of the snow

459
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,580
so we don't have to drag
it over all the boulders.

460
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:53,440
Come on.

461
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,346
Yeah, a little bit more.
Yeah, there you go.

462
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,510
- Back on.
- That's it. Yeah.

463
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,626
That is almost it.

464
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,936
Hold on. Stay right there.
Stay right there. That's it.

465
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,796
I just got to tighten
this up, but it's over with.

466
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,246
It shouldn't be a
huge accomplishment,

467
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:10,386
- but it really is right now.
- It really is.

468
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:13,596
All right. That's
it. Tracks are on.

469
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,456
Let's move the dredge
up to the cul-de-sac.

470
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,480
All right.

471
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,726
We're way ahead of
the game right now.

472
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:20,906
- Yes. Absolutely.
- I love it.

473
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:21,836
Just ride in.

474
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,006
Just make sure we
don't hook anything.

475
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,246
Yeah, we'll have to
watch those boards.

476
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,870
I'll walk behind it
to help us guide it.

477
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:28,790
Yeah, baby.

478
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,216
That's no problem, dude.
Get on top of it, Paul.

479
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,440
There you go.

480
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,526
Look at the mountains
behind him. That's badass.

481
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:43,866
How badass is this, dude?

482
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:47,030
Looks like a freaking
dog musher, dude.

483
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,556
So we're going to beat one
of the all-time honors this year.

484
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,766
They did it in the fall and the
winter when there was snow.

485
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,526
Get it set up,
things melted down,

486
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,866
their equipment
was sitting there,

487
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:00,010
and they were ready to go
as soon as the snow melted.

488
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,106
The frenzy for Alaskan gold

489
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:10,656
began over 120 years ago when
the discovery of gold in the Yukon

490
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,416
sparked the original gold rush.

491
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,596
Thousands of intrepid adventurers
raced to the chilkat mountains,

492
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:21,906
eventually digging out more
than 80,000 ounces of gold

493
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:27,416
worth over $160
million in today's money.

494
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,346
It's estimated there's
200 million ounces of gold

495
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:33,626
still in the ground in Alaska,

496
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:37,000
but only in the hardest
to reach locations.

497
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,976
We made it!

498
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
My gosh, it's so
bright out here.

499
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,346
We're weeks ahead now.

500
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:46,696
Dude, we're way ahead, man.

501
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,076
- That saved a lot of time.
- Good job on the idea

502
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,906
of dragging it up in the snow.

503
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:51,936
It's better than trying to
carry it out here by hand, man.

504
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,696
- My god.
- Let's get this going.

505
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,656
We're just one step closer.

506
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,486
We need to be in that
water yesterday, all right?

507
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:00,286
Yesterday.

508
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:02,696
All right. Let me go
look at this creek, man.

509
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,036
Just see what we
were dealing with, right?

510
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,146
Yep.

511
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:07,866
- It sounds mild right now.
- Man, look at that water.

512
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:10,076
Look how clear! Whoo!

513
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,100
Man.

514
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:13,906
Holy, dude.

515
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:15,726
Do you remember how
hard of a time we had just

516
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:18,346
getting across from here
over to there last year?

517
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:19,550
Yeah, I do.

518
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,036
One of the things I'm
worried about right now

519
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:27,006
is last year when we
went up there, it was ice.

520
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:31,526
Giant slabs of
15-foot thick ice.

521
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:34,216
And you can't see up
there to see what's going on.

522
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,036
So I'm going to
grab my little drone.

523
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,416
I'm going to fly it up there

524
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,720
and see what we're going to see.

525
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,960
Hopefully, when the
drone goes up creek,

526
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,836
he can locate our dive site.

527
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,836
Best case scenario,
we can set shop up

528
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,270
and start dredging tomorrow.

529
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,100
Let's just tilt this
straight down, shall we?

530
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,106
I am so confused at what
I'm looking at right now.

531
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:03,146
That's got to be big-ass
Boulder right there.

532
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:06,030
That's all that ice that we
were looking at last year, isn't it?

533
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,240
Whoo. Look at that.

534
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:10,440
So let's back up.

535
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:13,250
All right, where's
my new property line?

536
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,720
Let's look up.

537
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:21,480
There it is. That's
it right there, look.

538
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:24,060
That looks perfect, actually.

539
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:28,240
So do we have to go through
that ice bridge to get up there?

540
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,510
I think so.

541
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,006
It's the snow Bridges
that freak me out, man.

542
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:41,440
That's stopping us from
dragging that dredge up that creek.

543
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,936
That is a big snow bridge, man.

544
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,480
I got to make a plan.

545
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,766
In order to pull our
dredge all the way up

546
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:53,246
to our dig spot, there
is one snow bridge.

547
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:56,176
And we have to melt
through this stuff really quick.

548
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,286
Not like last year.

549
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:00,076
We spent so much
damn time cutting on ice.

550
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,316
I'm not having it this year.

551
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,620
We need to be in
this water yesterday.

552
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,696
You guys ready to melt some ice?

553
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,936
Hell yeah. That
snow bridge has to go.

554
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,076
Desperate to get a
jump start on the season,

555
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,626
the crew waste no
time getting to work

556
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:31,866
on the 20-foot snow
barrier blocking their path

557
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:33,890
to the new section
of their claim.

558
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,176
- Yep. Got it.
- There we go.

559
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,286
Going for the drop.

560
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:41,146
This year, they've
come prepared with

561
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:42,796
a new weapon in their arsenal.

562
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:45,890
Right now, what
we have is kind of...

563
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,936
Convoluted.

564
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,316
We have a water pump.

565
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,106
It's gonna pull
out of the creek.

566
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:53,036
It's gonna pump it
into a high-pressure

567
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:57,076
water pump over to a
heater that's gonna convert

568
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,550
the water into really hot steam.

569
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:02,346
Dustin's plan?

570
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:05,146
Use the bush fix
device to create a jet

571
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:09,346
of pressurized hot water
capable of slicing through

572
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:13,340
the 20-foot-high snow barrier
like a hot knife through butter.

573
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:16,130
- Ready to run?
- Yeah.

574
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,030
Man.

575
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,480
Yeah!

576
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,216
- Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
- Nice!

577
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,580
Yeah!

578
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,930
Good pressure!

579
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,006
Look how quick that
is! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

580
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,286
That thing works great!

581
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:37,480
This thing's working perfect!

582
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,510
Look what we got now!

583
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,246
No, no problem.

584
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:46,960
Big boulders, no problem.

585
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,100
Flood?

586
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:53,100
We're working on that.

587
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:00,006
Dude, this water is
scorching hot, dude.

588
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:02,246
- Yeah.
- Scorching hot. Holy moly.

589
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:04,656
I can see the steam
coming out underneath it.

590
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,526
So the hot water helped, right?

591
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,176
My gosh.

592
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,696
That's a game changer, man.

593
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,556
This is cheating, dude.

594
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,720
I love it.

595
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,246
Dude, I bet you can get
that big chunk to come off.

596
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:21,976
- I bet you can get that.
- That's what I'm trying to do.

597
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Nice.

598
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:29,556
The hot water and
the pressure together

599
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,106
cutting right
through ice Bridges.

600
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:33,936
That's pretty awesome.
That's a win for me today.

601
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,596
It's going to cut
weeks of snow cutting

602
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:40,796
the way we were
doing it into hours.

603
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:44,556
It's nice that it worked, but I've
accepted that it's going to work.

604
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:47,146
And now I've already
moved on to the next stage,

605
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:51,796
which is decision
making and where to dig

606
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,866
and how to dig it.

607
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:55,246
And what are you doing and...

608
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,936
And the only person to
blame when this is over with,

609
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,416
if I fail, is me.

610
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,556
But if I succeed,
I get that too.

611
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,240
Hopefully I succeed this year.

612
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,456
This is where
we're going to dig?

613
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,386
This is what I want.

614
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:15,076
While James and Carlos battle
the mammoth snow barrier,

615
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:20,036
Dustin, Paul, and Wes head
upstream to inspect the ground

616
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:22,456
inside their new
claimed boundary.

617
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,726
Yeah. Check it out, man.

618
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,866
Our property line,
just so you know,

619
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:28,486
- okay.
- Is right the here.

620
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:31,526
This is our property line.
It goes right through here.

621
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:35,976
The fact that this is going
down, and as wide as this is,

622
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,146
it makes a great gold
catch, because the canyon

623
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:41,626
narrows back down, it's
going to slow the water down,

624
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,346
and this is a fallout area.

625
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:44,556
Yep.

626
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,906
- That would be the inside bend.
- I think that's so close.

627
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:47,170
- That's tough.
- Yeah.

628
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:55,486
Fifty feet up from the ice bridge lies
Dustin's newly extended boundary line,

629
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:59,246
containing a section of
prime ground as it lies just

630
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:02,936
below a steep, narrow
drop-off in the river.

631
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,596
Capable of carrying
the largest and heaviest

632
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,526
material on the creek,

633
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:10,796
it runs directly into the
slower-moving waters

634
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:13,006
of the inside bend

635
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:16,556
where gold, 19 times
heavier than water,

636
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:20,416
can settle and could have
deposited the monster nuggets

637
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,100
this creek is famous for.

638
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,486
We're going to start right here.

639
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:31,416
Where the snow patch is, we're
going to go right through that.

640
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,456
Matter of fact, while
he's cutting that ice,

641
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,000
we can start popping
some of these rocks, man.

642
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,580
Why not?

643
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:41,106
They're going to be
done with that soon.

644
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:42,286
I need these rocks.

645
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:44,866
That one, that one, that
one, anything that'll crack.

646
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:47,146
All right. I'll do that.

647
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:48,620
Don't get hurt. Don't die.

648
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,726
To quickly remove
the heaviest boulders

649
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:55,796
from their dive site,
Paul will blast them

650
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:58,456
into smaller pieces
using targeted

651
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,936
rock fracturing technology.

652
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,486
So the mission for
today, drill and crack

653
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:06,006
as many big rocks as I can find.

654
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:09,626
It's the perfect time for me to
come over here and break rocks.

655
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:11,766
The more rocks we get
broke now, the better off

656
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:14,626
it'll be when we get
the dredging spot.

657
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:17,246
Years past, there's no way
we'd be busting rocks right now.

658
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:19,346
We'd be still trying
to set up camp.

659
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:21,480
It's so nice being ahead
of the game right now.

660
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:22,836
What?

661
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:25,456
Don't need no frickin' blanket.

662
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,656
I'd like to see
the rocks explode.

663
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:31,240
You guys are so
frickin' sappy, man.

664
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,340
Everybody ready?

665
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:40,906
Fire in the hole!

666
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:49,936
Perfect! Whoo!

667
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,976
That did more than
I thought it would do.

668
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,146
- Yeah, George, it's a lot more.
- -Holy

669
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:56,836
right now it's working great.

670
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:59,200
We're making big
boulders into pebbles.

671
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:03,960
That looks like bedrock
underneath this one.

672
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,240
That might be interesting.

673
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,106
I'm seeing that bedrock.

674
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:10,316
It could be a good thing
because it might just be a fin

675
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,270
that comes across,
and if that's the case,

676
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,060
we've got a plunge
pool up there.

677
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:17,556
There's a plunge pool.

678
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,386
The gold's not going
past that plunge pool.

679
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:20,906
There's going to be
a lot of gold up there.

680
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:24,720
So hopefully, that's just
a fin that's going across.

681
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,346
I think we're going to cut
through this ice like nothing.

682
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:30,596
This is going to be
easy for us this year.

683
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:33,176
Paul has already busted
rocks to clear space

684
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,766
for our new dive site.

685
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:37,580
Fire in the hole!

686
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,130
This is awesome.

687
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:53,076
- James, look at the water.
- I see that.

688
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,486
Look at this water,
dude. Cave-in, dude.

689
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,286
We're about to have a landslide.

690
00:34:57,310 --> 00:35:00,650
Holy we got to get out of here.

691
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,076
Every so often,
we get that steam

692
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,416
coming underneath the ice.

693
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,246
That's a telltale sign
that we broke through.

694
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:20,556
For this crew to
succeed in the untamed

695
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,930
wilderness of Alaska,

696
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,696
they must operate in the zone

697
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,626
between craziness and insanity.

698
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:31,106
- Okay, that's getting a little scary.
- Yeah, dude.

699
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,146
It's starting to scare me, man.

700
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,976
Oh, there it goes.

701
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,006
- Woo-hoo!
- Man.

702
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:40,866
Yeah!

703
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:43,146
It scared the out of me.

704
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:45,510
We need gold.
Everybody needs gold.

705
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:04,836
- James, look at the water!
- I see that.

706
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:09,416
At nugget creek, a landslide
upstream has turned the creek

707
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,790
into a raging torrent
of murky whitewater.

708
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,626
Holy!

709
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:17,580
We must have had a landslide!

710
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,246
With all these snow
Bridges that we have, just like

711
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:25,416
the one we're trying to cut,
there's a bunch of them upstream,

712
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,726
so anytime one of them lets go,

713
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:30,130
it puts a lot of dirty
water and debris...

714
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:34,656
It closed up. We
gotta get out of here

715
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,146
because that means it
dammed up the creek

716
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:40,480
and when it melts that snow,
it's gonna be a wall of water.

717
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,130
Keep an eye on that for sure.

718
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:51,656
It's not doing nothing, dude.
It's not even cutting, man.

719
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,216
Yeah, we did get some
chocolate milk in the water,

720
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,650
meaning that we got a
landslide up above us.

721
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:02,006
That's a big, big problem with
any machinery that uses hot water

722
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:04,796
or any kind of water filtration.

723
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:08,790
We went from 100%
destroying down to 50%.

724
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:10,930
No heat.

725
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:14,720
What the is up with
that pressure washer?

726
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,580
They have no pressure.

727
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:22,310
- They have no pressure.
- No pressure.

728
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:25,960
What's going on?

729
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:41,106
Yeah.

730
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:43,100
Look, you see? Hey,
you see the steam?

731
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,346
Getting this out of
the way will mean

732
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:53,696
that we'll be dredging
way faster than last year.

733
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:57,100
So that's great. That's
frickin' awesome.

734
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,866
We can now bring
the dredge up here.

735
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:34,106
I think what we have is
about a month and a half

736
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:36,386
before all hell
breaks loose here.

737
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:38,656
Can we get enough gold
in that month and a half

738
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,866
to stretch out?

739
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:41,974
We're here already,
man. We're already here.

740
00:40:41,998 --> 00:40:42,998
I know.

741
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:26,960
Whoo-hoo!

742
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:32,550
Yeah!

743
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,060
This place is for real.
