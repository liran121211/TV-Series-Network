1
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:10,809
Dustin!

2
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:12,578
At rockfall ravine,

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,615
A month of lifting the biggest
boulders the crew has ever seen.

4
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:19,985
Has wrecked their
rock pulling system...

5
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:21,687
There's one of our anchor bolts.

6
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:22,888
Putting a stop to them.

7
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,724
Dredging for
chunky gold nuggets.

8
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:27,526
The other one's about to pop.

9
00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:30,095
Yeah, it popped
one bolt at least.

10
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:31,964
Started pulling
the other one out.

11
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:35,000
So we have broken anchors?

12
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:38,637
I guess our mammoth fall
put your anchors to the test?

13
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:42,374
There's no way we're diving.
Let's work on that skyline.

14
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:43,976
Fix the broken bolts.

15
00:00:44,078 --> 00:00:45,689
You've gotta make sure
that everything's safe enough.

16
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:49,748
To really pull on
some gigantic boulders.

17
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,218
Marine veteran Carlos
baynor volunteers to drill.

18
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,221
The new anchor
bolts into the cliff face

19
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:59,958
30 feet above the
raging creek below.

20
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:02,795
Why don't you drill some holes?
Make sure they're deep enough.

21
00:01:02,897 --> 00:01:04,329
I need you to set
up a come along,

22
00:01:04,432 --> 00:01:06,932
Put two or three
shackles on that.

23
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:09,468
Make sure it's all set up.
James, you know what to do?

24
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:11,070
Yep. Do it.

25
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,843
How's that hole coming, man?

26
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:20,312
I think I messed it up because
it's just spinning there...

27
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,481
Just spinning in the chuck.

28
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:23,583
You alright?

29
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:25,984
I'm not comfortable at all.

30
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:28,020
Okay. Stop. Stop,
stop, stop, stop.

31
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:32,278
Yeah don't... leave
that in there, come up.

32
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:40,592
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. What are you doing?

33
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:42,701
Hey. Carlos!

34
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:47,840
We need to toughen
up and get the job done.

35
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:49,708
What could possibly go wrong?

36
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,344
I got a spy from fred's team.

37
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:53,846
Pain in the butt.

38
00:01:55,683 --> 00:01:57,649
It's a big damn rock, man.

39
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:59,952
I think I'm sliding.

40
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,226
Ooh, that was rough.

41
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,708
If there turns out to be no
gold down there, though,

42
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:14,099
I guess I'm eating
noodles for a looong time.

43
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:16,602
Gold can't swim in liquid dirt.

44
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,704
Our nugget day!

45
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:20,105
Get out of here, man.

46
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:22,374
Look at that. Wow. This
is gonna be amazing.

49
00:02:33,087 --> 00:02:34,119
Don't fall.

50
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:38,869
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. What are you doing?

51
00:02:38,893 --> 00:02:40,092
Whoa.

52
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:42,761
Hey. Carlos! Dustin!

53
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:44,963
How you doing, man?

54
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:46,265
How do I get the up here?

55
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:47,866
Alright. Hold on. Hold on. Stop.

56
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:49,868
Here's what you do...
you grab that one,

57
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,404
And you pull that up.

58
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:53,972
Yep. All the way.

59
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:56,275
Now reach up and grab
that rope and take a step.

60
00:02:57,545 --> 00:02:59,978
Whoa.

61
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,847
Man, it's always a
weird feeling, right?

62
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:05,083
Yeah, it...

63
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:08,554
Take a break. Come back to it.

64
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:10,355
I gotta figure this out.

65
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:15,928
For dustin's crew,
the clock is ticking.

66
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,765
They now have less than
60 days in their season.

67
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,668
Before the Alaskan
winter hits hard.

68
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,436
This is taking forever.

69
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:28,907
Dustin risked his life
savings buying these claims.

70
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:32,010
Finally, the gamble
is starting to pay off,

71
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:35,047
Pulling out nuggets every dive.

72
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:38,150
But hiding the nuggets
are monster boulders.

73
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:41,086
That have destroyed
their skyline anchors.

74
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:43,155
I think we're done with this.

75
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:50,462
Basically, we just reset our
anchors and tightened it up,

76
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,631
Tightened up our skyline again.

77
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:56,835
It's tighter now.
Bigger, better bolts.

78
00:03:56,937 --> 00:04:01,273
So now I can get back to
work. Find a big pile of gold.

79
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:10,315
We're still out in the same box.

80
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,351
Today is the day, fellas.

81
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:14,319
I can feel it, man.

82
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,054
Upstream at the trifecta,

83
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:20,592
Fred hurt has staked his season
on finding an ancient waterfall.

84
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:23,328
With a plunge
pool flush with gold.

85
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,464
But unlike Dustin,

86
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:29,101
Fred's skeleton crew have
found next to nothing at all.

87
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:32,571
Well, if there turns out to be
no gold down there, though,

88
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:35,207
I guess I'm eating
noodles for a looong time.

89
00:04:37,378 --> 00:04:39,278
Fred's newest diver, Scott,

90
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,445
Is unable to dive.

91
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:44,116
After injuring his
hand last week.

92
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:47,319
Sliced right through, and
these are down to the bone.

93
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:50,922
And it's uncertain what his
most experienced diver, Paul,

94
00:04:51,025 --> 00:04:51,923
Will return.

95
00:04:52,026 --> 00:04:53,458
We're already missing Paul,

96
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,093
And it makes it
really, really hard.

97
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:57,896
With the amount of work
that's on all of our backs.

98
00:04:57,998 --> 00:05:00,132
Down to a two man dive crew,

99
00:05:00,234 --> 00:05:03,135
Fred and Ryan are
on double dive duty.

100
00:05:03,237 --> 00:05:05,370
You can go about
every three days.

101
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,105
And go diving... it's okay.

102
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:10,509
But, boy, you try to do it
day after day after day...

103
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:13,745
It's not a good situation.

104
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:18,417
Ryan took the last dive,
so it's fred's turn today.

105
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:21,520
Looking good.

106
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:22,654
How's that?

107
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:25,157
Feels good.

108
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,292
Go ahead, Fred.

109
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:31,263
Whooo! My forehead is cold.

110
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:36,568
It's gonna follow that on
down that bedrock wall.

111
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,571
Until the bedrock flattens out.

112
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,074
And that's what we have
to do to get to the gold.

113
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:45,744
Fred's theory is
that the trifecta.

114
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,980
Was once the site of
an ancient waterfall,

115
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,917
Creating a 20-foot-deep
plunge pool.

116
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:57,756
Now at seven feet, Fred
must head straight down.

117
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:01,126
Through another 13
feet of rock and gravel.

118
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:06,365
To get to the gold-rich
bedrock floor below.

119
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:08,667
This gotta be a waterfall.

120
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:10,702
Got a dip in the bedrock.

121
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:12,304
You got a dip in the bedrock,

122
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:16,975
You got a good
place for catching gold.

123
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:20,545
Hope and pray that
when we get down there,

124
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:23,715
He's right and there's a
bonanza of gold down there.

125
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:25,984
Fred's hose sucks the gravel up.

126
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:28,053
And sends it to the sluice box.

127
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:30,455
Where the gold should
settle in the riffles.

128
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:34,626
You see that this is
all jagged right here.

129
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,696
It's all full of little
layers right here.

130
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:42,868
This is not carved
out by glaciers.

131
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,270
This is carved by water.

132
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:48,206
Fred believes these
layers in the rock face.

133
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:52,210
Could be evidence
of his ancient waterfall.

134
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:53,912
The side that we're
we're dredging,

135
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:55,881
You can see all the
jagged edges sticking out.

136
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:58,350
It's like nature's sluice
box right through there.

137
00:06:58,452 --> 00:06:59,918
I agree 100%, man.

138
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,531
We're gonna find
some gold down in there.

139
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:02,454
I guarantee it.

140
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:04,322
I hope so, man. We need it.

141
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:08,493
Yeah, this is good material.

142
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,295
How's it goin', Fred?

143
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:13,331
After an hour of dredging
good-looking gravel,

144
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:16,501
Scott and Ryan
check the sluice box.

145
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,438
You know, there should be a
lot more material in this thing.

146
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:23,341
Yeah, pretty gloomy
looking box today, buddy.

147
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:26,011
Yeah.

148
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,012
Fred?

149
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:28,213
What now?

150
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:29,881
I've got a problem.

151
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:32,017
What the hell are
y'all doing up there?

152
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,685
We're having some problems.

153
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,523
Fred, this box is empty.

154
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,725
This is not good.

155
00:07:40,828 --> 00:07:42,761
Alright, shut your motors down.

156
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:48,434
Why don't we just pan it?

157
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:50,469
See if there's
anything at all in that.

158
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:52,904
Scott pans a
sample of the tailings.

159
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:56,641
At the back of the sluice to
check if they're losing gold.

160
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,718
I'm seeing gold in it.

161
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,119
In my mind, it just says that.

162
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:11,022
You're just letting
the gold right on down.

163
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:13,164
I guess I just want to set
it up to where we caught.

164
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:17,128
Every piece of gold that
came through here, period.

165
00:08:17,231 --> 00:08:19,008
I didn't come up here to
run a whole bunch of rocks.

166
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:20,532
Just because I
wanted them washed.

167
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:23,435
You know? I came
up here to get gold.

168
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:26,805
We're gonna have to do
something about this, man.

169
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:29,007
Ryan gets to work.

170
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:31,843
I'm gonna grind out
some of these bars.

171
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,979
And I'm gonna
bend the riffles up.

172
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:36,414
That's gonna give
us less of an angle.

173
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:39,084
And more of a dead
zone behind the riffle.

174
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,486
So that gold will have a
real nice place to settle.

175
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:43,388
Right in the
back of the riffles.

176
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,561
As the water and gravel
run through the sluice box,

177
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,264
The heavier gold
should sink to the bottom.

178
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:55,000
And be caught in the riffles.

179
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:57,669
But their angle is sending
the water and gold.

180
00:08:57,771 --> 00:09:02,741
Out the back of the box
with the worthless tailings.

181
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:04,676
Ryan's plan...

182
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:08,046
Bend the riffles up to
increase the water vortex,

183
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:12,150
Slowing the flow of
water, trapping more gold.

184
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:19,524
All your job.

185
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:22,460
Here... we'll bend them
up a little bit more here.

186
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:24,362
You can finish them off.

187
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:29,379
We don't really have
a choice in the matter.

188
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:32,270
We're just doing the best
we can with what we have.

189
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:35,273
Good job, there, man. Good job.

190
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:36,975
The modification to the riffles.

191
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,611
Will finally start
catching all the gold.

192
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:42,013
On their way down
to the big payday.

193
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:45,917
They believe is on the bedrock.

194
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,385
By bending those up,

195
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:49,754
We're gonna be catching
more material, I believe,

196
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:52,591
Than what we're doing
right now with these riffles.

197
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:53,703
Can't wait to get in there.

198
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:55,927
And find out exactly
what we're gonna get.

199
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:59,197
Deeper we go, more
gold we're gonna get.

200
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:00,932
Alright. Good. Perfect.

201
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:03,869
Up ahead

202
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:05,470
I'm pretty concerned about Fred.

203
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:07,138
He is 77 years old.

204
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,407
What could possibly go wrong?

205
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:10,509
Oooh!

206
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:13,211
The most lucrative
job we've ever had.

207
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:24,122
I'm diving today, so it's
gonna be a good day.

208
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:25,790
So I go get suited up or what?

209
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:28,393
I think it's time.
Water does look good.

210
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,206
As long as it's clear,
we're in good shape.

211
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,965
I'd love to just be able to just
keep digging and getting gold.

212
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:37,202
After five weeks
of raging melt water,

213
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,871
The worst of the
winter snow has thawed,

214
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:43,708
Improving the dive
conditions at rockfall ravine.

215
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,343
This is gonna
be a hell of a day.

216
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:47,245
Were you about six feet here?

217
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:49,047
Yeah, right there. Right there?

218
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,718
Hey, James, did you take
any weight off that belt?

219
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,153
10 pounds.

220
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:57,022
Is that hot enough for you?

221
00:10:57,124 --> 00:10:58,723
Feels pretty good.

222
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:03,094
Hey, you're all
rock and roll, man.

223
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:07,866
In the water.

224
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:09,334
I'm goin' down there.

225
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:10,335
How's the current?

226
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:12,303
It seems pretty good.

227
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,541
The rockfall ravine dive site.

228
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:19,778
Is scattered with
buried chunky nuggets.

229
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,747
Dustin's mission is
to hunt them down.

230
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,883
Leaving no boulder unturned,

231
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:30,955
As one small pocket could
contain life-changing gold.

232
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:34,292
So I can't see very well.

233
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:39,731
Should I keep going or not?

234
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:45,070
Come here, James. Please.

235
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:49,307
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- What what the.

236
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:50,920
What do you got
there? What do you got?

237
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:53,311
No way! What?!

238
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:54,446
Look at that!

239
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:56,748
Is that gold?!

240
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,349
Put him over if that's gold.

241
00:11:58,452 --> 00:11:59,751
I can't tell down here.

242
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:02,320
You just don't
understand how dark it is.

243
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:06,157
Holy moly, dude!
That's a good piece.

244
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:07,892
Is it? Yes!

245
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:11,463
Wow. Good job!

246
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,133
Whooo!

247
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,135
That's crazy! Are
you kidding' me?

248
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,738
Look at that. Look at that gold.

249
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:25,188
He wasn't even in the water
not more than 15 minutes.

250
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:26,878
Lo and behold, he
comes across a nugget.

251
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:27,980
Can you believe that?

252
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,749
Wow, that's like a
quarter of an ounce!

253
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:34,619
For now, dustin's crew
are still on the nuggets.

254
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:37,856
With gold heading
towards $2,000 an ounce.

255
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,125
And nuggets
selling at a premium,

256
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:44,829
This single find is
worth more than $500.

257
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,297
This is it.

258
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,534
Hopefully it continues to
hand us nuggets every day.

259
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:58,877
Back to work.

260
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:00,411
At the trifecta,

261
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:05,116
Fred's skeleton crew still have
over 13 feet of rock and gravel.

262
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:08,887
To clear to get down
to the bedrock gold,

263
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:12,223
And only Fred and
Ryan are able to dive.

264
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,294
You know, I'm pretty
concerned about Fred.

265
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:19,197
He is 77 years old
busting a hump down there.

266
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,766
So the plan today is to
move a bunch of boulders.

267
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:24,736
And a bunch of rocks
down there in our deep hole.

268
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:27,505
You know, if I can move
a lot more boulders today,

269
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:28,973
Move a lot more material,

270
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:32,710
It might make it a
little bit lighter on Fred.

271
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:36,548
Fred's crew have found
barely any gold this season,

272
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:41,386
But he believes there's a
payday on bedrock 20 feet deep.

273
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,354
They just have to get there.

274
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:48,293
Are we ready? You're ready.

275
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:49,861
Let's do it.

276
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:59,137
But right now, Ryan is just
filling baskets with rock.

277
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:00,471
And he's dredging.

278
00:14:00,574 --> 00:14:04,409
He's getting a lot of
material out of there.

279
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:07,445
It's looking pretty nice
on this back slope now.

280
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:09,914
Yeah. Well, good.

281
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,483
Couple rocks left,
but not too much.

282
00:14:12,586 --> 00:14:15,453
Yeah, just pile them over there.

283
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:17,488
Ryan's efforts have paid off.

284
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:19,390
He's deep in the hole by a foot.

285
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:24,028
And dredged material
up into the sluice.

286
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,209
Ryan, you can probably
just make your way back here.

287
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:27,632
We're done.

288
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:30,768
The dredge's working fine.
The winches are working fine.

289
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:34,973
All the anchors holding up.
What could possibly go wrong?

290
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:40,323
Fred is staking everything
on the trifecta paying out.

291
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:44,449
And needs Ryan’s
riffle fix to have worked.

292
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,484
How much have you got in there?

293
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:48,497
It looks like we're catching
a little bit more material,

294
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:50,088
That's for sure. Yeah, I mean...

295
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:53,458
If we clean that
out, say, tomorrow,

296
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,026
Tomorrow afternoon, maybe?

297
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:56,961
Okay. Good job.

298
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,364
Our box is working
a lot better now,

299
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:00,466
And I'm pretty confident.

300
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,233
If we suck up any
gold from here on out,

301
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:03,968
It's gonna stay in the box.

302
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,004
That's music to my ears.

303
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:08,239
Tomorrow, I'm going down.

304
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:20,184
I need a knife or
something like that.

305
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:21,653
At rockfall ravine,

306
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:24,822
Dustin has been in
the water for four hours.

307
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:28,726
Hunting every inch of
the dive site for nuggets.

308
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:29,727
What do you got?

309
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:30,949
It's another piece, I think.

310
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:32,563
What?! What?

311
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:36,668
I found the perfect
little crevice.

312
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:40,338
I think it's got about a
half-ounce of nugget in it.

313
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,508
I can't tell 'cause it's
buried, so I gotta dig it out.

314
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,977
Hopefully it's as big
as it looks to my eyes,

315
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,280
But everything looks
bigger under water.

316
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:59,223
Yeah.

317
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:03,094
Look at... no way, dude!

318
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:05,663
Nugget, man?

319
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:08,099
I'm coming up, James.

320
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:09,901
James, get the gold!
James, get the gold!

321
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:11,336
I got it in my pants.

322
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:14,205
And I can't feel it
'cause of my gloves.

323
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:18,876
Hold on. It's stuck
in your gl... It fell.

324
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,212
Aaaah!

325
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:33,491
Okay.

326
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:36,627
I'll try it again.

327
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:41,366
You gonna get it this time?

328
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:43,601
Yeah, I got it.

329
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:46,170
Take the thing.

330
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:48,806
That's a nice piece.

331
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,643
Look at that baby.

332
00:16:52,746 --> 00:16:54,779
Look at that!

333
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:56,114
That's awesome, man.

334
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:58,160
He's just picking up
nuggets. That's all he's doing.

335
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,595
I like that. That'll work.

336
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:00,763
So that means
there's gotta be some.

337
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:01,686
Going to the dredge, too.

338
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:03,154
Yeah.

339
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:08,459
Two nugget day for Dustin
hurt. Two nugget day.

340
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:16,234
We have company. We
got a spy from fred's team.

341
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:18,069
Scott? Yep.

342
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:21,305
Good for him. I'd wanna
see this place, too.

343
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:23,174
Lack of gold at fred's site.

344
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:27,412
Has pushed new recruit, Scott,
to investigate the opposition.

345
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:29,047
How's it goin' up there?

346
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:30,149
It's goin'.

347
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:33,051
Ryan put in about
three hours today.

348
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:34,752
We're still on team the box,

349
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:36,687
But we'll get...

350
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,701
We're just moving a lot
of overburden right now.

351
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:39,624
Yeah.

352
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:40,870
I wanted to check
out a rockfall.

353
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:43,294
Let's see how
varsity does it, man.

354
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,129
This awesome, man.

355
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,465
You're barely 100 feet
over top of this waterfall.

356
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,047
Yeah, this has got
real danger to it.

357
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:51,803
Yeah, it does.

358
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,237
First was bigger.

359
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:55,173
Yeah, I can't wait
to go look in the box.

360
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:56,941
There's gotta be some in there.

361
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:02,080
Can't touch it, but
you can look at it.

362
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:03,781
Yeah, that's a piece.

363
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:05,616
That's all the stuff.

364
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:09,253
Probably have at least a
quarter-ounce of fines in there.

365
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:12,890
Check that out, Scott.

366
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:14,358
Look at that nugget, buddy.

367
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:17,428
Wow.

368
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,970
Seeing the gold
in their sluice box.

369
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:21,532
Makes me a little
annoyed at our spot.

370
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:25,336
You know, somewhere up
creek, there's that mother lode.

371
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:29,107
And I'm really hoping that
trifecta is that right spot.

372
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:31,175
Dude, just come
work on our side, man.

373
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:34,445
I would love to be over
here, brother. I really would.

374
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:37,648
I would take that opportunity
in a flying heartbeat.

375
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,918
Dustin's crew are
on a winning streak.

376
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,255
Their nugget hunt is paying off.

377
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:46,557
We're getting really good
nuggets out of this thing.

378
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:50,795
I hope it continues all
season to tell you the truth.

379
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:53,331
This is...

380
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:55,166
This is great.

381
00:19:08,214 --> 00:19:09,714
At Mckinley camp,

382
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:13,584
Carlos is up early,
hungry for nuggets.

383
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:19,690
I'm diving today
and my main focus.

384
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:22,660
Is the competition to get gold.

385
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:24,462
On his last dive,

386
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:27,665
Dustin pulled out two
quarter-ounce nuggets.

387
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:30,401
Worth over $1,000,

388
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:34,305
And Carlos is determined
to stay on the gold.

389
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:36,807
Who wouldn't want to have a
day that... dive day like that?

390
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,809
Pulling out gold. You know?

391
00:19:38,912 --> 00:19:41,946
Everybody wants
to pull out gold.

392
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:43,481
Get the gold!

393
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:50,755
Gonna be a an awesome
dive today, dude.

394
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,201
Yeah, we can take
things slow and easy.

395
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:54,058
I am expecting
a lot of gold, man.

396
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,027
'Cause I know you're
good with the gold.

397
00:19:56,129 --> 00:19:58,729
I can't wait to see what
happens when I go in there.

398
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:01,432
But Dustin wants
Carlos to switch track.

399
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:02,833
And do some heavy lifting.

400
00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:04,802
Hold on. Hold on. Nope, not yet.

401
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:06,404
To keep the crew safe,

402
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:10,074
His plan for Carlos is
more grunt than glory.

403
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:12,154
You're gonna go down there.
There's gonna be some rocks.

404
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:13,778
Move those.

405
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,013
Okay. These rocks right
here, I'll move them, man.

406
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:17,949
No problem. Some
deadly ones here.

407
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:21,085
I got it, man. I'll
assess the situation.

408
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,088
Diver going in the water.

409
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:33,197
Ooh.

410
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,066
Oooh, I see you, rock.

411
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:39,370
This is a boulder, man.

412
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:40,905
Dude.

413
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:44,242
That's what's gonna kill us is
those big teetering boulders.

414
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:47,478
That the current
is hitting so hard,

415
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,114
You just know they're gonna go.

416
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:51,749
A giant boulder is hanging.

417
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:55,286
Directly over
dustin's dive site.

418
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:58,589
Making the area a kill zone.

419
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:00,958
If the crew continue
to dredge the dirt.

420
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,194
And rocks beneath the boulder,

421
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:07,665
It could come loose,
crushing anything in its path.

422
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,233
Carlos' mission...

423
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:12,136
Remove the boulder
from its unstable position.

424
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:16,040
Using the skyline and clear
the boulder downstream.

425
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:21,178
Honestly, I didn't anticipate
rocks the size of cars.

426
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:24,148
This is one of the biggest
boulders we've tried to move.

427
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,449
This three-ton boulder.

428
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:30,488
Will test the skyline
anchor bolts to their limits.

429
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,422
Am I safe?

430
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:33,324
You are safe right there.

431
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:34,426
Okay.

432
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,559
There she goes!

433
00:21:35,662 --> 00:21:37,461
Goin'.

434
00:21:37,563 --> 00:21:39,030
That's just movin', too.

435
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:41,365
That's a.

436
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,067
That's good. Bring it in.

437
00:21:44,404 --> 00:21:48,572
Holy moly. Holy moly.

438
00:21:48,675 --> 00:21:52,109
- So stressful!
- My

439
00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:53,611
dude.

440
00:21:53,713 --> 00:21:56,814
Holy moly, you're halfway there.

441
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,276
It almost got
stuck in there, man.

442
00:21:59,252 --> 00:22:00,284
Rocks falling!

443
00:22:00,386 --> 00:22:02,953
Look at that.

444
00:22:03,056 --> 00:22:04,533
I can't believe you
get that out of there.

445
00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:05,323
Now that far, dude.

446
00:22:05,425 --> 00:22:07,858
Holy moly, man.

447
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,160
Come on!

448
00:22:09,262 --> 00:22:10,795
There it goes!

449
00:22:10,897 --> 00:22:12,697
Is it moving? Yeah.

450
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,665
There it goes.

451
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:18,169
Come on, come on. Come
on. Come on. Come on.

452
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:31,716
Whooooo!

453
00:22:31,818 --> 00:22:34,318
Holy.

454
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:36,987
You know your
skyline's doing good.

455
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:39,623
When you can
pop cables like that.

456
00:22:39,726 --> 00:22:41,025
Wow!

457
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:43,794
Well, that's the biggest
rock we've ever moved here.

458
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:48,632
There's no doubt of that. It
was enough to break a cable.

459
00:22:48,735 --> 00:22:50,634
Now the boulder
is out of the way,

460
00:22:50,737 --> 00:22:52,603
The dive site is safe.

461
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:56,240
Carlos has achieved the
mission and gets back to the glory.

462
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:59,243
Of hunting for more nuggets.

463
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:02,713
Alright. Show me some gold, man.

464
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:04,014
Let's see what I got!

465
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:13,090
Alright, man. I've
got a nugget today.

466
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:15,893
A nugget. Whoa!

467
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:17,461
What the

468
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:20,097
look at that nugget!

469
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:21,866
My.

470
00:23:21,968 --> 00:23:23,178
That's a pretty nice nugget.

471
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:24,935
That's a nice nugget.

472
00:23:25,772 --> 00:23:27,605
So Carlos came up with a nugget.

473
00:23:27,707 --> 00:23:30,341
That came out from
underneath that mammoth rock.

474
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:31,642
Another pretty nice nugget.

475
00:23:33,613 --> 00:23:35,057
He's trying to pull out
another nugget right now.

476
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:36,347
I can hear him.

477
00:23:36,449 --> 00:23:39,417
It's another day for me.

478
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:41,519
Man. They're getting better.

479
00:23:41,621 --> 00:23:42,686
That one broke in half!

480
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:44,155
That's beautiful, man.

481
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:45,956
I love that you're
getting comfortable.

482
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:48,292
Bringing up two
nuggets one day, buddy.

483
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:49,927
Yep. I love it.

484
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:51,996
That's the norm
for us now, dude.

485
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:53,764
Yeah, that's the daily norm.

486
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:55,266
Is at least bring
up two nuggets.

487
00:23:55,368 --> 00:23:56,500
How about that?

488
00:23:59,572 --> 00:24:02,606
Of course, man.
Getting tired, though.

489
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:03,874
Four hours in.

490
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:06,877
And having matched
dustin's two nugget dive,

491
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:10,781
Carlos is low on energy
and ready to call it a day.

492
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:13,050
Whoa, wait a minute.

493
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:16,298
It's a three nugget day!

494
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:18,689
It's a three nugget
day. Three nugget day?

495
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,491
It's a three nugget day!

496
00:24:20,593 --> 00:24:24,862
Carlos, I think you got the
record on this one, buddy.

497
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:28,110
- Three nugget day.
- Ohhhh.

498
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:30,668
Damn, man! Look at that?

499
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:33,537
That is beautiful. Whoo!

500
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:35,339
My goodness.

501
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:36,441
Three nugget day!

502
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:38,008
Three nugget day.

503
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,544
Look at that.
Beauty. Look at this.

504
00:24:44,884 --> 00:24:45,950
What number in my hand?

505
00:24:46,052 --> 00:24:47,818
- What number in my hand?
- My.

506
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,820
This will be number four.

507
00:24:49,922 --> 00:24:51,088
That is awesome.

508
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,556
You're on fire right now, man.

509
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:53,557
Look at you. What you got?

510
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:54,959
Ha haaaa!

511
00:24:55,061 --> 00:24:56,126
My.

512
00:24:56,229 --> 00:24:57,629
It's even bigger
than the last one.

513
00:24:58,631 --> 00:25:01,131
Carlos, you are on fire.

514
00:25:01,234 --> 00:25:02,833
Whoo-hoo-hooo!

515
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:05,236
Nugget!

516
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:06,704
Look at you, man.

517
00:25:06,806 --> 00:25:09,006
That's number four.
That's number four, man.

518
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:11,742
It's gonna be real
hard for me to beat this.

519
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:13,911
You're my hero right now, man.

520
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:17,214
That's nugget number four
he's brought up by hand.

521
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,293
Alright, man.

522
00:25:30,763 --> 00:25:33,097
Good job today, man. Damn it.

523
00:25:34,634 --> 00:25:37,001
Whoo! I'm free!

524
00:25:37,103 --> 00:25:39,737
Good job, dude.
Awesome dive, man.

525
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:41,005
- Aah.
- Hey, Carlos.

526
00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:42,540
I don't even have to check, man.

527
00:25:42,642 --> 00:25:46,588
That's the most lucrative
dive we've ever had ever.

528
00:25:46,612 --> 00:25:47,745
That's crazy, right?

529
00:25:47,847 --> 00:25:50,214
Hands down across the board,

530
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:53,918
The most lucrative dive
we've ever, ever, ever had.

531
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,887
You kept this boy for
two frickin seasons.

532
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:59,456
Without seeing nothing, man.

533
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:01,525
Yeah? Yeah?

534
00:26:01,627 --> 00:26:03,527
You pull out three
or four nuggets?

535
00:26:03,629 --> 00:26:05,863
Four. I'm so jealous.

536
00:26:05,965 --> 00:26:08,132
That one boulder, man.

537
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:10,968
The combined value
of Carlos' four nuggets.

538
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,504
Is over $2,000.

539
00:26:13,606 --> 00:26:16,073
They're onto a bonanza of gold,

540
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:19,343
Meaning rockfall
ravine is on track.

541
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:23,581
To become the most
gold-rich ground of their lives.

542
00:26:23,683 --> 00:26:26,784
Carlos found gold right where
we thought we'd find gold.

543
00:26:26,886 --> 00:26:28,586
Underneath one
of the big boulders.

544
00:26:28,688 --> 00:26:30,187
Four nugget day, brother.

545
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:31,822
Four nugget day, man.

546
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:34,024
The old timers couldn't
move the big boulders.

547
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:35,793
I think they skipped
over a lot of stuff.

548
00:26:35,895 --> 00:26:38,062
That was way too hard to dig.

549
00:26:38,164 --> 00:26:40,598
But we had to be stubborn
enough to keep doing it,

550
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,534
Creative enough to
be able to pull this off,

551
00:26:43,636 --> 00:26:47,972
And tough enough
to just keep going.

552
00:26:48,074 --> 00:26:49,074
We did.

553
00:26:49,175 --> 00:26:50,874
And now it's paying off.

554
00:26:50,977 --> 00:26:54,011
I hope it continues all season.

555
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,279
Up ahead...

556
00:26:55,381 --> 00:26:58,015
You just never know
when you're gonna find gold.

557
00:26:58,117 --> 00:26:59,583
I'm so frickin' excited.

558
00:26:59,685 --> 00:27:01,118
You got a big one? What?!

559
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,654
This is the biggest one that
he brought up so far today.

560
00:27:03,756 --> 00:27:04,955
Get out of here, man.

561
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:06,991
Look at that. Look at that.

562
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:16,533
I'd like to see some
gold in the box today.

563
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:18,535
We could sure use it.

564
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:21,605
At the trifecta, morale is low.

565
00:27:21,707 --> 00:27:25,175
Fred's crew have found
next to no gold this season.

566
00:27:25,277 --> 00:27:29,580
And still have over 12
feet to go to reach bedrock.

567
00:27:29,682 --> 00:27:30,814
I'm thinking that there is.

568
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:33,517
Some sort of a hole
to catch the gold in.

569
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:36,353
Anything got in there
could be a bonanza.

570
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:38,522
It would be good for
the morale of the crew,

571
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:41,392
And it sure would be
good for my morale.

572
00:27:41,494 --> 00:27:43,927
Down to just a
two-man dive crew,

573
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:47,031
77-year-old Fred
is forced to dive.

574
00:27:47,133 --> 00:27:51,135
For the second time this
week, and the pressure is on.

575
00:27:51,237 --> 00:27:52,536
It does put us in a bind.

576
00:27:52,638 --> 00:27:55,272
Because it's little more
strenuous on the divers.

577
00:27:55,374 --> 00:27:56,607
And it will be a test.

578
00:27:56,709 --> 00:28:00,044
We need to toughen
up and get the job done.

579
00:28:02,148 --> 00:28:04,448
Hopefully breaking it down
there dredged that material up.

580
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,694
And there'll be some gold in it.

581
00:28:05,718 --> 00:28:07,562
You know, we gotta clean
up at the end of the day.

582
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:09,264
It'd be nice to have
some gold in the box.

583
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:10,187
Alright.

584
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:12,122
Go down there and give her hell.

585
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:13,323
Good to go.

586
00:28:13,426 --> 00:28:15,092
Well, we'll see
how things go today.

587
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:16,994
Go get in there, gold hound.

588
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,433
Looking good down
here. Let me look around.

589
00:28:23,703 --> 00:28:26,003
If there ends up being
no gold back there,

590
00:28:26,105 --> 00:28:28,083
I'm gonna be growing my
own vegetables in the backyard

591
00:28:28,107 --> 00:28:29,907
'cause I'm gonna
be broke as hell.

592
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:33,077
So I hope fred's
right. I really do.

593
00:28:34,747 --> 00:28:37,614
Fred dredges up
small rocks and gravel,

594
00:28:37,717 --> 00:28:41,752
Sending them to the sluice
box and deepening the hole.

595
00:28:41,854 --> 00:28:43,654
What's the material
looking like down there?

596
00:28:43,756 --> 00:28:45,956
Are you seeing any
change in the layer?

597
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:49,593
Lots of small rocks. A lot
of them go up the dredge.

598
00:28:49,695 --> 00:28:51,562
It's alright. Well, good, man.

599
00:28:51,664 --> 00:28:54,031
You ought to be able to make
a lot of headway today, then.

600
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:55,133
You got it.

601
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:57,601
The box is looking
a lot better today.

602
00:28:57,703 --> 00:28:59,269
The change in riffle angle.

603
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:03,006
Is already showing better
results in their sluice box.

604
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:04,374
Yeah, I'm down.

605
00:29:04,477 --> 00:29:08,846
I know I'm deeper
than I've been down.

606
00:29:08,948 --> 00:29:10,514
Well, fred's down
in the hole now,

607
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:13,717
And he's about 8
1/2, 9 foot down.

608
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:16,887
So he's starting to get
into some new material.

609
00:29:16,989 --> 00:29:19,123
He's running a lot
through the sluice box.

610
00:29:19,225 --> 00:29:21,625
And, you know, we're really
hopeful at the end of the day,

611
00:29:21,727 --> 00:29:23,827
There's gonna be
some gold in the box.

612
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:27,197
For two seasons,

613
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:30,834
Fred and Dustin dredged
just 10 feet from here.

614
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:34,004
And failed to hit it big.

615
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:35,973
You're coming up on 4 1/2 hours.

616
00:29:36,075 --> 00:29:39,943
But Fred is convinced that they
were diving in the wrong place.

617
00:29:40,045 --> 00:29:45,315
And right now he's directly
above a gold ridge plunge pool.

618
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:48,051
We're just over eight
feet here, almost nine feet.

619
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:49,453
So hopefully this next layer.

620
00:29:49,555 --> 00:29:51,021
Is gonna give us
at least something.

621
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,990
It can't get no worse.

622
00:29:53,092 --> 00:29:57,127
Holy crap. The world is
going straight down almost.

623
00:29:57,229 --> 00:30:01,031
The bottom just
doesn't go straight out.

624
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:05,402
So there's a big area
here that's really deep.

625
00:30:05,504 --> 00:30:10,474
It's a good possibility
this hole is part of the bowl.

626
00:30:10,576 --> 00:30:14,111
On this waterfall. Whooo!

627
00:30:16,015 --> 00:30:17,714
Gosh.

628
00:30:17,817 --> 00:30:19,750
Nine feet into the hole,

629
00:30:19,852 --> 00:30:23,520
Fred has made a
crucial discovery...

630
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:27,057
A near-vertical wall of bedrock.

631
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:31,328
Fred believes this is the
face of the ancient waterfall.

632
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,964
That will lead him
into the plunge pool.

633
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:37,467
And a pile of gold in
the bottom of the bowl.

634
00:30:39,238 --> 00:30:41,205
I'm gonna come up.

635
00:30:41,307 --> 00:30:43,173
I'm so frickin' excited.

636
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:45,542
This may very well
be that bonanza.

637
00:30:45,644 --> 00:30:46,977
That fred's always
talking about,

638
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:48,645
This bucket of gold down there,

639
00:30:48,747 --> 00:30:50,981
So there's only
one way to find out.

640
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:54,685
And that's just get down
there, get to bedrock, and find it.

641
00:30:55,621 --> 00:30:57,432
Whoo!

642
00:30:57,456 --> 00:30:58,822
Good job, Fred.

643
00:30:58,924 --> 00:31:01,703
Fred's discovery
proves to the crew.

644
00:31:01,727 --> 00:31:04,995
That his ancient waterfall
is more than a theory,

645
00:31:05,097 --> 00:31:09,399
And they could be just 11
feet above a giant payday.

646
00:31:09,501 --> 00:31:11,568
Today was a good dive.

647
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,136
The bedrock is coming down,

648
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:16,039
And then it drops off
20-something-feet deep.

649
00:31:16,141 --> 00:31:18,809
Any time you find a
bedrock that drops off,

650
00:31:18,911 --> 00:31:19,977
It pretty well proves.

651
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:22,880
That you've got a
plunge pool right there.

652
00:31:22,982 --> 00:31:26,183
You're gonna look for gold in
the bottom of that plunge pool.

653
00:31:38,797 --> 00:31:41,665
Carlos had an
amazing day yesterday.

654
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:46,703
Just nuggets everywhere.

655
00:31:46,805 --> 00:31:50,741
At Mckinley camp, after
seasons of striking out,

656
00:31:50,843 --> 00:31:54,344
Dustin's crew are onto
the best gold of their lives.

657
00:31:56,181 --> 00:31:57,814
It was crazy what happened.

658
00:31:57,917 --> 00:32:00,117
We're hoping for
the same day today.

659
00:32:00,219 --> 00:32:03,587
Dustin's desperate to
carry on the winning streak.

660
00:32:03,689 --> 00:32:06,356
And beat Carlos'
four nugget record.

661
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:08,625
With his second
dive of the week.

662
00:32:09,995 --> 00:32:12,596
I'm a little jealous.
I'm not gonna lie.

663
00:32:17,903 --> 00:32:19,202
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

664
00:32:23,008 --> 00:32:24,808
That just about
ripped my mask off.

665
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:25,910
I should have grabbed it.

666
00:32:28,881 --> 00:32:31,315
The material's
never been touched.

667
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:33,183
And it keeps going down.

668
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:40,724
Look what I can see.

669
00:32:40,826 --> 00:32:43,093
You gonna bring us some nugget?

670
00:32:43,195 --> 00:32:44,728
I think I got it.

671
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:48,199
My gosh.

672
00:32:54,073 --> 00:32:55,205
That's good.

673
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:57,474
Good morning, sir. Yeah.

674
00:32:57,576 --> 00:33:00,877
One nugget. Three more
to go... catch up to me.

675
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:04,781
As long as we're bringing up
golden nuggets, we're happy.

676
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,953
You still up there,
wes? Yep, I'm here.

677
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:15,459
It's not as big as
the other one, but...

678
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:16,838
That doesn't matter.
That still counts.

679
00:33:16,862 --> 00:33:18,628
It's just numbers.

680
00:33:21,467 --> 00:33:22,966
That works.

681
00:33:23,068 --> 00:33:24,368
- Second nugget.
- Got two!

682
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:27,237
Got two more to go
to catch up with Carlos.

683
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:30,140
It's coming.

684
00:33:30,242 --> 00:33:32,209
Alright, you can
bring me a basket.

685
00:33:32,311 --> 00:33:35,012
Okay, copy that. Basket's
coming in the water.

686
00:33:35,114 --> 00:33:36,146
Thank you.

687
00:33:41,987 --> 00:33:44,254
Not sure what time it is,
but this has to get done.

688
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:45,789
Copy that.

689
00:33:45,891 --> 00:33:49,326
Just keeps going down.
Straight, straight down.

690
00:33:49,428 --> 00:33:51,695
That's insane, man. How
deep do you think you are?

691
00:33:51,797 --> 00:33:54,898
I have no idea.

692
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,703
Aw, man, I'm doing a
handstand inside of a hole.

693
00:33:59,805 --> 00:34:01,805
I don't know how you
can see with a vis like this,

694
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:06,309
But he's been down for
four or five hours now.

695
00:34:06,412 --> 00:34:09,179
Done with this.

696
00:34:09,281 --> 00:34:10,747
Nope. No more gold.

697
00:34:14,353 --> 00:34:15,585
Hold on.

698
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:18,522
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

699
00:34:18,624 --> 00:34:19,756
You got a big one?

700
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:20,858
What? What?!!

701
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:23,093
What?! Whoo! Aw, hell yeah!

702
00:34:23,195 --> 00:34:27,030
They're not too huge
but they're in there.

703
00:34:27,132 --> 00:34:30,233
I can barely stand up, bro.

704
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:31,234
Oohh!

705
00:34:31,336 --> 00:34:33,503
Oooh!

706
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:35,739
Aaaah!

707
00:34:35,841 --> 00:34:37,174
Carlos, is that three now?

708
00:34:37,276 --> 00:34:38,276
That's two! Two?

709
00:34:38,377 --> 00:34:41,611
No, that's three. Three!

710
00:34:41,713 --> 00:34:43,280
He's catching up to you!

711
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:44,948
This is dustin's third nugget.

712
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:47,651
This is the biggest one that
he brought up so far today.

713
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:51,521
It's probably close to a
quarter-ounce, just guessing.

714
00:34:51,623 --> 00:34:53,190
Every time we
get under boulders,

715
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:55,125
Get into deep areas,
there's nuggets.

716
00:34:55,227 --> 00:34:57,060
It's awesome.

717
00:34:57,162 --> 00:34:59,362
And that's gnarly. That
hasn't traveled anywhere.

718
00:34:59,465 --> 00:35:02,833
So there could be a source
right here close to where we're at.

719
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:04,546
We know for sure that
none of the old timers,

720
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:07,003
Nobody has been
to this area yet.

721
00:35:07,106 --> 00:35:09,172
This is what we've
been looking for.

722
00:35:12,678 --> 00:35:14,044
There's gold in there?

723
00:35:14,146 --> 00:35:15,345
You gotta shut it off, man.

724
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:16,447
I think so.

725
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:20,117
Dustin has been
diving for five hours,

726
00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:24,121
Determined to beat
Carlos' four nugget record.

727
00:35:24,223 --> 00:35:26,123
He digs us up a
grave every time.

728
00:35:26,225 --> 00:35:29,292
When he gets tired, he's
just going after the gold.

729
00:35:33,165 --> 00:35:35,866
What now?

730
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:37,467
What, what, what?!

731
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:39,603
What?!

732
00:35:39,705 --> 00:35:42,639
You got a big one?

733
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:45,142
I think my mind playing
tricks on me right now.

734
00:35:48,614 --> 00:35:49,980
I'm comin' up.

735
00:35:58,757 --> 00:36:01,825
Oooh!

736
00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:05,228
There's a couple of them.

737
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:08,543
Whoo! Four nugget
day! It's getting' bigger.

738
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:10,066
- Get it!
- My.

739
00:36:10,169 --> 00:36:12,235
That's like, a quarter
of an ounce, dude.

740
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:17,107
I... Had a great big
day, and I am exhausted.

741
00:36:18,143 --> 00:36:20,443
Dustin's hard work has paid off.

742
00:36:20,546 --> 00:36:25,949
These four nuggets combined
are worth over $2,000.

743
00:36:26,051 --> 00:36:27,051
Good dive, man.

744
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,818
What a job, what a
job. Four nugget day!

745
00:36:28,921 --> 00:36:30,654
Awesome dive.

746
00:36:30,756 --> 00:36:32,389
You look tired, dude.

747
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:34,391
You sound like you're
going to pass out.

748
00:36:34,493 --> 00:36:36,226
Ooh, that was rough.

749
00:36:36,328 --> 00:36:39,663
You're gonna carry me out here.

750
00:36:39,765 --> 00:36:41,231
I'll bring you up in the basket.

751
00:36:53,145 --> 00:36:55,779
Right now, we're getting
ready for our first cleanup.

752
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:58,515
I'm nervous. It can be horrible.

753
00:36:58,617 --> 00:37:01,885
At the trifecta, fred's
crew are having doubts.

754
00:37:01,987 --> 00:37:04,854
Heading into their first
cleanup of the season.

755
00:37:04,957 --> 00:37:08,058
After blowing gold
out of their sluice box.

756
00:37:10,195 --> 00:37:13,063
You just never know
when you're gonna find gold.

757
00:37:13,165 --> 00:37:14,798
You just never know.

758
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:18,902
And, well, you never know
when you're not gonna find gold.

759
00:37:19,004 --> 00:37:21,037
Fred has discovered
what he believes.

760
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:23,907
Is the wall of the
ancient waterfall.

761
00:37:24,009 --> 00:37:26,443
But his skeleton
crew need more proof.

762
00:37:26,545 --> 00:37:29,312
That they are on track
for a massive payday,

763
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:33,016
So Fred is called for the
first cleanup of the season.

764
00:37:33,118 --> 00:37:35,418
It'd be really disappointing
to be doing all this work.

765
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,488
For the last month
or so now and...

766
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,824
Nothing to show for it.

767
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:43,460
I'm not really looking
forward to this.

768
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:45,662
I'm a little worried
myself, brother.

769
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:47,764
All you can do is
hope for the best.

770
00:37:47,866 --> 00:37:50,433
That thing's heavy.

771
00:37:50,535 --> 00:37:52,769
Worth its weight in gold.

772
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:55,171
Hope so.

773
00:37:59,344 --> 00:38:00,504
What are you seeing in there?

774
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:03,513
Things are looking pretty
damn good right now.

775
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:07,484
You know, for overburden,
this is pretty good stuff.

776
00:38:08,353 --> 00:38:09,552
Whooo!

777
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:14,224
Yeah. There's gold in there.

778
00:38:14,326 --> 00:38:17,427
Every single pan,
I'm seeing gold in it.

779
00:38:17,529 --> 00:38:20,063
Bending those ripples
worked perfectly.

780
00:38:20,165 --> 00:38:22,265
The crew are still 11 feet away.

781
00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:24,067
From the bedrock floor,

782
00:38:24,169 --> 00:38:28,004
But even this small amount
of gold is a promising sign.

783
00:38:28,106 --> 00:38:31,975
That fred's ancient
plunge pool theory is right.

784
00:38:32,077 --> 00:38:34,711
And they could be in
for a monster payday.

785
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:36,980
It's pretty sweet to see
this from our overburden.

786
00:38:37,082 --> 00:38:39,282
I can't wait to see what we
get when we get to bedrock.

787
00:38:39,384 --> 00:38:41,951
This whole area is
one ancient waterfall.

788
00:38:42,054 --> 00:38:45,422
Deeper we go, the more
gold we're gonna get.

789
00:38:45,524 --> 00:38:47,590
Any time you can
find any gold at all,

790
00:38:47,693 --> 00:38:48,825
It's a good day.

791
00:38:52,864 --> 00:38:54,631
What a dive.

792
00:38:54,733 --> 00:38:56,366
At rock fall ravine,

793
00:38:56,468 --> 00:38:59,369
Dustin has pulled
off a five-hour dive.

794
00:38:59,471 --> 00:39:03,006
And already matched
Carlos' four nugget record.

795
00:39:03,108 --> 00:39:05,675
Now he's banking
on the sluice box.

796
00:39:05,777 --> 00:39:07,277
To break the tie.

797
00:39:07,379 --> 00:39:08,478
Nuggets!

798
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,813
Big nuggets!

799
00:39:09,915 --> 00:39:12,649
Come check it out.
They're glowing.

800
00:39:12,751 --> 00:39:13,751
Look at that.

801
00:39:13,819 --> 00:39:17,153
Man. This is the
best we ever done.

802
00:39:17,255 --> 00:39:19,022
Holy crap!

803
00:39:19,124 --> 00:39:21,024
This is the best I've
ever seen the box.

804
00:39:21,126 --> 00:39:22,759
That one nugget's
at least a half-ounce,

805
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:24,694
Three or four
quarter-ounce nuggets,

806
00:39:24,796 --> 00:39:26,262
A bunch of smaller nuggets.

807
00:39:26,365 --> 00:39:29,566
So right now, gold is running
pretty close to $2,000 an ounce.

808
00:39:29,668 --> 00:39:31,201
So you look at that right there.

809
00:39:31,303 --> 00:39:35,105
And I've got probably $5 grand
sitting in my hand right there.

810
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:36,840
Check this out, dude!

811
00:39:36,942 --> 00:39:37,841
What are we talking about, man?

812
00:39:37,943 --> 00:39:39,976
Well, we're talking about a lot.

813
00:39:40,078 --> 00:39:43,046
Get out of here,
man. Look at that.

814
00:39:43,148 --> 00:39:44,581
That is beautiful.

815
00:39:44,683 --> 00:39:46,182
Look at that. That is beautiful.

816
00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:47,817
Talk about a lucrative dive.

817
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:50,854
I work for that, man. Holy cow.

818
00:39:50,956 --> 00:39:54,023
I was getting changed and I
leaned down to grab my socks.

819
00:39:54,126 --> 00:39:56,159
And started just throwing
up. I'm like, "my god."

820
00:39:56,261 --> 00:39:57,894
Went way past my limits.

821
00:39:57,996 --> 00:40:00,330
Well, you overworked
yourself today. That's for sure.

822
00:40:00,432 --> 00:40:02,265
That is the definition
of gold fever...

823
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:07,036
Pushing your body till you
about to pass out underwater.

824
00:40:07,139 --> 00:40:12,876
I never, ever seen that
much gold ever, bro.

825
00:40:12,978 --> 00:40:14,577
This pile of chunky nuggets.

826
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:20,717
Is a breakthrough for Dustin
and is worth more than $8,000.

827
00:40:20,819 --> 00:40:23,553
We're trying to find places
the old timers didn't get,

828
00:40:23,655 --> 00:40:26,156
And I'm pretty sure this
nugget ball at rockfall ravine.

829
00:40:26,258 --> 00:40:27,490
Is one of those places.

830
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:30,293
I went broke
getting these claims.

831
00:40:30,395 --> 00:40:35,098
And basically didn't
know if it was worth it.

832
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,001
Well, it's worth it.

833
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:41,137
Dustin's gamble
is finally paying off.

834
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:44,674
The crew are on the
richest ground of their lives.

835
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,609
If they can stay on the goal,

836
00:40:46,711 --> 00:40:50,246
They're in for their
best season ever.

837
00:40:50,348 --> 00:40:53,550
It's been a long time coming,
but it's finally paying off.

838
00:40:53,652 --> 00:40:58,188
Handfuls of nuggets every
day. This is gonna be amazing.

839
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:00,323
Feels pretty good.

840
00:41:00,425 --> 00:41:03,359
On the next "gold
rush: White water"...

841
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:05,495
First dive. I'm excited
but I'm nervous.

842
00:41:05,597 --> 00:41:08,064
If you mess up, it could
cost you your life, man.

843
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:12,702
He'll make it. His ego
won't let him not make it.

844
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,070
If that thing pops up,

845
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:16,039
It just smacks you
right in your mouth.

846
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:17,640
!!

847
00:41:17,742 --> 00:41:19,209
Gotta be careful, man.

848
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:22,245
We can see quite a few
boulders overhanging.

849
00:41:23,915 --> 00:41:26,015
Scott, have you got a copy?

850
00:41:26,117 --> 00:41:28,284
That's a big mother lode.

851
00:41:29,387 --> 00:41:30,427
We all know how much work.

852
00:41:30,489 --> 00:41:31,788
It took to get that.

853
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:33,656
Finally doing it, guys.
