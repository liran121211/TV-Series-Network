1
00:00:07,708 --> 00:00:11,510
All right, guys, it's time to
find out how much gold we got.

2
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:13,779
J<i> ust over halfway</i>
<i>through a season.</i>

3
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:16,415
<i>Shortened by
the global pandemic,</i>

4
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:21,120
<i>Dustin hurt and his crew are on
the richest ground of their lives.</i>

5
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,057
How many ounces do you think
we got for three dives?

6
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:27,559
I say about ten.
That's a safe bet.

7
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:30,763
I'm saying 15.
Just looks like to me.

8
00:00:30,865 --> 00:00:32,297
I say eleven.

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,533
<i>Okay, I'm hoping
there's more than ten ounces.</i>

10
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:36,368
<i>That makes for
a pretty good week.</i>

11
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,071
<i>I think the gold in here is
from James from hills drive.</i>

12
00:00:39,173 --> 00:00:41,440
It looked like a lot of gold
when he came up, man.

13
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,142
<i>This is exciting.</i>

14
00:00:43,244 --> 00:00:45,122
<i>I mean, we're getting
underneath these boulders.</i>

15
00:00:45,146 --> 00:00:47,546
Got our hippo boulder
out of the way and.

16
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:49,408
And we started getting
closer to the bedrock.

17
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,283
That stuff is just full of gold.

18
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,252
<i>That's probably an
ounce sitting there.</i>

19
00:00:53,354 --> 00:00:56,021
<i>I bet there's more
than an ounce sitting there.</i>

20
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:58,157
It's just good
to be on the winning team.

21
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:01,226
<i>- How does it look?
- That's good.</i>

22
00:01:05,366 --> 00:01:06,366
It doesn't look great.

23
00:01:07,535 --> 00:01:08,667
That doesn't look very good.

24
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:10,936
<i>That's just one dive.</i>

25
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:15,908
There was more in it than that.

26
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:19,878
I know there was more than that.

27
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,058
<i>There was something like...</i>

28
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:22,082
Something's wrong.

29
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:24,083
No, that looks right to me.

30
00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:26,418
<i>That looks like quite
a bit of gold right there.</i>

31
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,520
<i>It could have gone anywhere.</i>

32
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:29,822
<i>Been locked up.</i>

33
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:32,024
<i>- You didn't leave the door open?
- No.</i>

34
00:01:32,126 --> 00:01:34,726
<i>I saw that cleaned up and
it looked bigger than that.</i>

35
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:36,228
<i>Something doesn't add up.</i>

36
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:41,333
We're at a dead stop.

37
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:42,612
- Is it that bad?
- Well, yeah.

38
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:44,214
<i>If you let me have
control of your site,</i>

39
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:45,003
<i>We'll get it done.</i>

40
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:46,705
We're here to save the day!

41
00:01:49,043 --> 00:01:51,410
<i>We got a big bedrock.</i>

42
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:53,045
It's not a headache boulder.

43
00:01:53,147 --> 00:01:54,480
<i>It's a man-killer.</i>

44
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:56,915
Fred, there's a lot of tension
on that ride.

45
00:01:57,017 --> 00:01:58,684
<i>There are winds that are.</i>

46
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:00,519
<i>Miner zero, boulder one.</i>

47
00:02:03,124 --> 00:02:04,456
<i>This isn't gonna last long.</i>

48
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,793
- <i>I bet someone's there.
- </i> - <i>yeah, I know.</i>

49
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:10,896
Three, two, one.

50
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:13,098
<i>Look at all that gold.</i>

51
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:14,666
I knew there was
something there.

52
00:02:27,348 --> 00:02:28,492
I remember when I looked at it,

53
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:31,483
It seemed like it was
all the way across the board.

54
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:33,619
<i>I feel like there's a lot more.</i>

55
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:34,786
<i>Last week</i>

56
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:36,455
<i>that big rock.</i>

57
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:39,658
<i>Dustin's crew
used new blasting technology,</i>

58
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,226
all right. Let's do this.

59
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:43,929
<i>To remove a monster rock.</i>

60
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:47,966
<i>From their dive site,
rockfall ravine.</i>

61
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:49,835
Did you see that?

62
00:02:51,272 --> 00:02:54,673
<i>Beneath it, James
discovered pile of nuggets.</i>

63
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:59,578
We knew it's gonna be down
there underneath that rock.

64
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,213
It's paid off.

65
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:03,715
<i>Now, wes is cleaning up the gold.</i>

66
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:07,019
<i>James sent down the sluice
on that dive,</i>

67
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:09,121
<i>But it's coming up short.</i>

68
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,926
<i>Right now, my brain
is on fire with,</i>

69
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:15,127
<i>"I'm making it up or not."</i>

70
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,829
Something's not right.

71
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:19,565
<i>It was more
on that mat than that.</i>

72
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:21,534
<i>No, I don't think so.</i>

73
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:24,703
I'm not joking.
It was more than that.

74
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:26,838
<i>I remember there being
big pickers in there.</i>

75
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:28,574
<i>Did you separate
the big pickers?</i>

76
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,411
<i>You know what? You're right.</i>

77
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:33,657
<i>I've got nuggets
that I pulled out.</i>

78
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:34,991
<i>That we haven't put
with anything.</i>

79
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:37,516
<i>So, there's a least another
three ounces of nuggets.</i>

80
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:39,518
- There you go.
- <i>this was in this.</i>

81
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,786
<i>Now we're talking.</i>

82
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:45,857
<i>I knew something was wrong.</i>

83
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,727
Damn. All right. I'm not crazy.

84
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:51,430
<i>- That's a lot in that bottle.
- I know.</i>

85
00:03:51,532 --> 00:03:53,565
<i>Wes moves on to the concentrate.</i>

86
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:55,434
<i>From the two other dives.</i>

87
00:03:55,536 --> 00:03:58,303
<i>- My.
- Holy crap.</i>

88
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,205
<i>Look at that.
You see that, dude?</i>

89
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:03,208
<i>There's like an ounce
in one scoop.</i>

90
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,776
Look at that.

91
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:07,279
<i>Who else gets this
kind of gold by hand?</i>

92
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:08,381
<i>Anybody?</i>

93
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,015
<i>That's all in one weeks'.</i>

94
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:11,828
<i>You'll find the pockets
underneath these boulders,</i>

95
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:14,486
<i>Like you're finding every
little pocket's got gold in it.</i>

96
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:15,799
Well, let's get this panned up.

97
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:18,790
And get it dried out
and see how much it weighs.

98
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:19,625
<i>Hell, yeah, fellas,</i>

99
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:22,527
Look at us finding gold,

100
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:26,498
Like a real gold miners
and stuff, man.

101
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,466
<i>Got to scale the nuggets.</i>

102
00:04:27,568 --> 00:04:28,928
<i>Let's see
what this stuff weighs.</i>

103
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,004
<i>If the ground
under the hippo rock.</i>

104
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:33,872
<i>Is as rich they hope</i>

105
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:35,574
<i>- ready?
- Yup.</i>

106
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:38,043
<i>It could mean
there's a big payday to come.</i>

107
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:40,178
<i>Once they reach bedrock.</i>

108
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:47,085
Let me see, four ounces,
six, seven,

109
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:48,253
Eight point six ounces.

110
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:50,622
- With nuggets?
- No, without it.

111
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:52,024
Damn.

112
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:55,193
- <i>Plus the nuggets...</i>
<i>- -</i> P<i> lus the nuggets</i>

113
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:57,262
<i>eleven point four.</i>

114
00:04:57,364 --> 00:05:00,065
<i>Almost eleven
and a half ounces, total.</i>

115
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:01,533
<i>That's for one week.</i>

116
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,569
I said eleven. Eleven point
four is what it come out to.

117
00:05:04,672 --> 00:05:07,172
Not bad, guys.
That's for real three dives.

118
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:08,540
<i>Let's be clear.</i>

119
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:12,511
<i>That amount of gold came from
underneath one single boulder.</i>

120
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:14,813
<i>One hippo-sized bolder.</i>

121
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:15,747
Good deal, man.

122
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:16,915
<i>Their combined total.</i>

123
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:19,818
<i>Of twenty five point</i> six ounces.

124
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,755
<i>Is close to matching
last year's entire haul,</i>

125
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:26,658
<i>And there are still
two months left to mine.</i>

126
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,294
<i>And with the price of gold
at a record high,</i>

127
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:33,031
<i>They're already $5,000 a head.</i>

128
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:36,201
<i>Gold's at over
$2,000 an ounce right now,</i>

129
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:37,736
<i>And for nuggets,
that's even more.</i>

130
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,439
<i>So, we're talking about
$2,800 an ounce.</i>

131
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,240
<i>If we continue our
season on like that,</i>

132
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:43,675
<i>It's going to be tremendous.</i>

133
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:45,777
<i>What's the story with
this ugly thing, man?</i>

134
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,580
<i>That probably is
right out of the source.</i>

135
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,149
That is a nugget, and
it's covered with host rock,

136
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:53,518
And it's the ugliest nugget
I've ever seen.

137
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,886
But it's still gold.

138
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:56,121
<i>So, you see that nugget?</i>

139
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:59,324
<i>You see how it's kind of
flattened and polished up?</i>

140
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:00,525
<i>It's traveled.</i>

141
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:03,328
So this one didn't come from
as close as this one did.

142
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,109
<i>This one came out from right there
where we were digging right now.</i>

143
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:07,544
<i>I believe.
It didn't travel anywhere,</i>

144
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:08,678
<i>So there's got to be a source.</i>

145
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,402
<i>Right there close
to where we're at.</i>

146
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:11,670
That's good news, right?

147
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:13,605
<i>Yeah. I'll take
those ugly nuggets.</i>

148
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:14,806
<i>Any day of the week.</i>

149
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:16,486
<i>I can't believe there was
that much gold.</i>

150
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,176
Under that single boulder.

151
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:19,711
<i>There's still boulders
down there.</i>

152
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:21,513
<i>And I hope this continues.</i>

153
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:23,348
I know for a fact
there's more gold to get.

154
00:06:24,318 --> 00:06:26,251
I'm just gonna go
collect it boys.

155
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:28,787
<i>We're doing great.
We're finally making money.</i>

156
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,722
<i>We're gonna not just break-even.</i>

157
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:32,524
<i>Or any of that stuff this year.</i>

158
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:35,727
<i>I feel like we're gonna
finally succeed.</i>

159
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:38,830
At what we're doing
and find a bunch of gold.

160
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:40,165
<i>All right, let's get to work.</i>

161
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:52,978
Plan is just to
get in there and kick ass.

162
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,780
<i>Half a mile upstream,</i>

163
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:57,716
<i>77 year-old Fred hurt is having.</i>

164
00:06:57,818 --> 00:07:00,485
<i>A much different season
than his son Dustin.</i>

165
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:03,955
All right. We're just going down
to see what's going right here.

166
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:07,859
<i>So far, Fred has faced
challenge after challenge.</i>

167
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:10,462
<i>You've got to be kidding me.</i>

168
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:12,364
But has refused to back down.

169
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:15,233
<i>In his hunt for
a life changing payday.</i>

170
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:18,737
<i>What you got? What you got?</i>

171
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,572
<i>That's gold.</i>

172
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:21,840
That's the real thing, man.

173
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:25,444
All right.

174
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,914
There goes fred's
synchronized swimming.

175
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:30,816
Down, down, down.

176
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:33,051
<i>Fred and his crew
are following the face.</i>

177
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:36,488
<i>Of an ancient waterfall
down to bedrock,</i>

178
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:40,325
<i>Where he believes they'll find
a massive deposit of gold.</i>

179
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:45,464
Fred, you get no dinner till
you find gold today, buddy.

180
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:47,566
<i>I'm trying to work on it.</i>

181
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:53,138
<i>But in their way is another
six feet of rocks and gravel.</i>

182
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,574
<i>I'm at 14 feet deep.</i>

183
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:57,876
<i>I don't have a hole to lock on,</i>

184
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,579
<i>Something to grab on,
on the side of the wall.</i>

185
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:02,614
<i>You're gonna finally
need a ladder down here.</i>

186
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:03,849
Copy that.

187
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:05,628
So he wants to put
another board out like that.

188
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:08,420
Then we could run that ladder
right down into this hole.

189
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:10,822
Fred wants us to run a ladder
down into the hole.

190
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:12,936
So it makes it easier for
the diver to come up and down.

191
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,460
Because right now walls
are pretty steep.

192
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:17,963
<i>Deeper we get,
the more dangerous it gets.</i>

193
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:19,242
<i>So anything we can do
to help that,</i>

194
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:21,566
<i>That's what we're doing.</i>

195
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,468
<i>I need a gold blaster.</i>

196
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:27,572
Copy that. Gold blaster
coming down the blue rope.

197
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,642
<i>- Fire it up.
- I'll fire it up.</i>

198
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:38,950
<i>We're just blasting away, man.</i>

199
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:40,452
<i>And now I'm on my way.</i>

200
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:42,821
<i>I'll just start
working my way out.</i>

201
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:44,923
<i>And make a bigger hole
out of it.</i>

202
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,791
<i>I feel like,
in the bottom of the hole,</i>

203
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:48,927
<i>There's a lot of debris.</i>

204
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,406
You're taking this nice,
clean water.

205
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:53,064
Up here, it's turning
all muddy, Fred.

206
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,900
<i>Wait a minute. Hold up...</i>

207
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:57,836
<i>Holy</i>

208
00:08:57,938 --> 00:08:59,371
<i>you all right down there?</i>

209
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:02,140
<i>We got a kick ass rock.</i>

210
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:04,009
<i>If we expand and hold on,</i>

211
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:06,111
<i>There's a gold mine on it.</i>

212
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:07,812
<i>Be careful, man.</i>

213
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:09,981
<i>We don't want to get
stuck down there, friend.</i>

214
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:14,319
<i>Extreme danger
for anybody down here.</i>

215
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:17,255
<i>I'm glad to get this
rock out of here.</i>

216
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:19,168
<i>I like fred's got a
pretty good rock down there,</i>

217
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:21,593
That he doesn't want anybody
under messing with.

218
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:23,873
I think he's gonna try to work
on it and do what he can.

219
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,463
To get that rock out.

220
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:29,167
<i>All right. I've got to
try blasting my way on it.</i>

221
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:31,269
<i>If I can cut this lose.</i>

222
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:34,005
<i>Fred is expanding
the sides of the hole.</i>

223
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:38,376
<i>To allow him to go deeper
towards the bedrock gold.</i>

224
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:41,246
<i>But if he undermines
this massive boulder,</i>

225
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:43,381
<i>It will come falling down,</i>

226
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:47,085
Crushing him
in the bottom of the pit.

227
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:49,821
Negative. It's a huge rock.
If that thing comes loose...

228
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:54,106
You're not getting out of it.
It would pin you down there.

229
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:56,027
<i>If it got your leg,
if it got your umbilical,</i>

230
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:57,209
<i>You'd be stuck down there.</i>

231
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,633
<i>I don't know exactly
if I'm gonna.</i>

232
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:04,569
<i>Get this damn thing
to move or not.</i>

233
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,806
<i>I didn't wonder if I'm gonna
get five more right there.</i>

234
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:09,174
It's finally wide enough.

235
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:12,911
To kind of pry this thing away
from the side of the wall.

236
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:15,480
<i>Give me that arc.</i>

237
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:18,750
The big pray bar? Copy
that. Let me go look for it.

238
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:22,187
Put a little bit of white tape on
this so you can see it underwater.

239
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,356
That's so we don't
lose tools underwater.

240
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,857
Hopefully, this will work.

241
00:10:28,562 --> 00:10:30,929
I put white tape on the handle
so it's easy to see.

242
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:32,631
Thank you.

243
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:36,746
Fred's down there trying to get
this big boulder out of the way.

244
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:37,770
I'm really concerned.

245
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:39,938
The size of boulder
he's talking about,

246
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,240
It's not a headache boulder,
it's a man killer.

247
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:44,576
All right.

248
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:47,045
I'm gonna make sure that
that big son of a.

249
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,247
Don't come rolling
down there visiting me.

250
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:52,684
If you can at least get it loose
to get it in the bottom of the hole,

251
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:56,254
<i>We can still work around it and still get
to the bottom and just keep rolling it down.</i>

252
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:59,190
Hopefully, he gets there
where it's not a danger anymore.

253
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:01,726
I'm getting
blocked in by one rock.

254
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:05,263
And I just can't
get down to that.

255
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:06,865
It's about head high.

256
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:09,746
And with it like that, if you undercut
it too much and it comes rolling in,

257
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,202
If you're on
the bottom of the hole,

258
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,371
<i>That's where you're gonna stay.</i>

259
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:17,542
I'm not gonna get
anything else done today.

260
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:19,611
Trying to get
that rock out of here.

261
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:33,825
I'll be damned.

262
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,494
Is everyone okay down there?

263
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:40,298
I just can't get
an advantage on this rock.

264
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,834
<i>Over two hours in the water,</i>

265
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:47,205
<i>77-year-old Fred continues
his battle with the giant boulder.</i>

266
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:50,742
<i>That stands between
him and the bedrock gold.</i>

267
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:55,113
<i>If I can get one little spot, I could
get a hell of an advantage, but I can't.</i>

268
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,882
Just sitting there
is all it's doing.

269
00:11:57,984 --> 00:11:59,918
Wanna turn at
a little bit of an angle.

270
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,597
<i>But it just doesn't
want to come right out.</i>

271
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:03,955
You know,
just for the hell of it,

272
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,524
Why don't you give me a strap?

273
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:08,626
You want the strap, you said?

274
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:10,495
Yeah. I'm going
to try something here.

275
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:11,830
Just hope it works.

276
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:13,865
<i>Fred attempts a quick fix,</i>

277
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:17,335
<i>Attaching a strap so that
they can try to pull it free.</i>

278
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:20,205
I got you looped on to this,
then if you wanted it.

279
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:22,807
I don't know...

280
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:26,277
It's a couple of pounds...

281
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:29,581
Can you take the end of the
cable, crook an arm, twist that?

282
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:31,182
Copy. We can do that.

283
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:35,286
I have no idea when we'll
have to start pulling on this thing.

284
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:37,355
Thanks, Fred.
Got that big rock hooked up.

285
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:38,623
We get this strap hooked up,

286
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:40,558
Maybe we can get
that rock pulled out.

287
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,160
<i>Do a little snag back.</i>

288
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,028
Copy that.

289
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:47,966
I have no idea if this
thing is gonna catch or not.

290
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:50,068
<i>You're pulling on a slab.</i>

291
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:54,439
<i>Hold it, hold it.</i>

292
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:55,974
Copy that.

293
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:58,243
<i>All right. Little tighter.</i>

294
00:12:58,345 --> 00:13:02,547
I guess, if we can even
get it to move at all.

295
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:04,682
Yeah, wiggle it a ton.

296
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,918
<i>Get a couple of those straps.</i>

297
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,020
Copy that.

298
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:09,521
- <i>Am I in the middle?</i>
- Yeah.

299
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:10,755
Going ahead.

300
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:12,157
<i>Got a hell of a line on it.</i>

301
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:14,125
<i>I just slipped right off.</i>

302
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:16,828
There's a lot of
tension on that, Fred.

303
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,663
Yeah, it is real tight.

304
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:21,666
<i>If the cable breaks,</i>

305
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:24,669
<i>It could slice
any of the miners in two.</i>

306
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:27,038
Yeah.

307
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,208
Pull it a little
tighter. Just a little

308
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,278
yeah, the strap

309
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,281
all right, it's not gonna work.

310
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,185
But I think it'll come up.

311
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:42,987
It doesn't seem
to want to take a strap.

312
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:45,757
Basically, we're trying to
lasso a rock down there.

313
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:47,358
Fred can get
the lasso around it,

314
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,762
But every time I pull on it,
it just slipped off the rock.

315
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:53,965
A really dangerous situation
down there right now.

316
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:56,234
So far, you've been down
for about three hours.

317
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,536
It is right now 12:40 p.M.

318
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:00,839
damn thing is so big.

319
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,776
Definitely don't want
anybody else to get to it.

320
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:08,580
It is going to be out of here
before I get out this afternoon.

321
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,522
Fred doesn't want
the next diver down in there.

322
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:12,817
<i>With something
like that overhanging.</i>

323
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:17,155
In his mind. It's his job to take
care of the more dangerous stuff.

324
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:19,691
But we've got some
young guys out here.

325
00:14:19,793 --> 00:14:21,259
We'd like to
get down there and help,

326
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:24,596
But is a stubborn old goat
so he's not having that.

327
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:27,665
He's gonna try to get
that boulder out today.

328
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:30,068
Wrap this thing just right.

329
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,437
A pressure washer, I think,

330
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:35,773
Might roll that big son
of a right into the basket.

331
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:37,775
Let's go and get
the basket down here.

332
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:38,878
Copy that.

333
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:42,146
So we've tried strapping it,

334
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:44,582
We've tried just
moving it by hand.

335
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:47,352
Now Fred is blasting around it
with a gold blaster.

336
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:49,999
<i>He's going to try to roll that big
boulder down into the rock basket.</i>

337
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:51,489
<i>So we can pull it up and out.</i>

338
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:53,157
So far, so good.

339
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,159
Getting down behind the rock.

340
00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:00,431
Material does not get in
the way... That's going lightly.

341
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,533
I'm standing down here.

342
00:15:02,636 --> 00:15:05,937
Get your feet out here, get
around, get down behind it.

343
00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:08,940
<i>Four hours in the water.</i>

344
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:13,578
<i>Fred's running out of time in
his battle with the deadly boulder.</i>

345
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,015
I mean, hell, hat rock's been
there for a long damn time,

346
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:19,417
So there could be
a major payday for us.

347
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,321
Nuggets! I'm talking nuggets
sitting underneath that damn thing.

348
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,890
So we really want to get it out.

349
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:31,829
All right, the sled is positioned
at the bottom of the hole.

350
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:36,734
Take the line off the sled and I'm
gonna see if we can pull that thing back.

351
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:39,103
All right, I got you
a choker cable. Ready?

352
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:41,372
Just waiting at the end
of a cable.

353
00:15:43,877 --> 00:15:45,343
All right, pick up a little bit.

354
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,512
No.

355
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:48,947
Keep going.

356
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:50,815
A bit more. A bit more.

357
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:52,483
Hold up. Hold up.

358
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:55,320
Is there any way we
could put that in a block?

359
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:57,655
I was just thinking
of the same thing.

360
00:15:57,757 --> 00:15:58,823
I'm on my way there.

361
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:00,959
<i>Fred's plan.</i>

362
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:04,329
<i>Position a snatch block
thirty feet upstream.</i>

363
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:06,631
<i>And lower down
on the creep wall.</i>

364
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:10,267
<i>This will redirect their winch
cable and create a better angle.</i>

365
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:13,638
<i>To pull the boulder out
from the side of the hole.</i>

366
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,607
We pulled the cable back a
little ways, give it a different angle.

367
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,442
Give it a different
direction of pull.

368
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:21,646
So hopefully now we can get
that boulder hooked up, right?

369
00:16:21,748 --> 00:16:24,215
With a different angle or pull.

370
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,594
We can get it down
into the basket.

371
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:26,778
So we can get it out of here.

372
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:28,119
All right.

373
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:31,222
All right. Pull in on that
just a little at a time.

374
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:34,025
All right. Copy that, Fred.
Pull on easy.

375
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,464
No!

376
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:41,399
The high is rigged.

377
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,568
Well, damn it, Fred.
What do you think, man?

378
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:45,724
Damn, these rocks
just keep going.

379
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:48,740
And going and going and going.

380
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:50,576
There's a good chance.

381
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:54,178
We won't even be able
to blow this stuff.

382
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,248
The score is miner zero,
boulder one.

383
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,785
So we definitely gotta get
that damn thing out of our way

384
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:04,022
I got a hose around
the back of this thing.

385
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:05,723
Dragging out here.

386
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:07,291
Be careful, man.

387
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:09,827
Don't worry about this.
I'm working on it.

388
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:14,532
It's possible if we can
blast a hole in it.

389
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:19,070
It could break.
Just be careful and slow.

390
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:20,652
All right.
The gold blaster's running.

391
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:24,542
I think fred's gonna try
to hook that rock up again.

392
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:26,744
One more attempt on
trying to get that boulder out.

393
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:28,046
Fred's approaching five hours.

394
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:30,515
That's the longest time
so far this year.

395
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:32,183
And he's been down there
working on it,

396
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:33,985
2,000 lb. Rock, the whole day.

397
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:36,020
That's got me concerned.

398
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:39,791
Yeah, I got it.

399
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,560
He's worked his way
underneath it, made a hole.

400
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:44,062
Now he's able to pass the cable.

401
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:47,198
Underneath the boulder
and attacked it on top.

402
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,620
Now all we gotta do
is pull on it.

403
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:50,401
And see if
it comes out of there.

404
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:52,303
This was not the way
we like to do things,

405
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:56,574
But unfortunately, all the
conventional methods have been tried.

406
00:17:56,643 --> 00:18:00,211
Now we just can't get it,
so unconventional it is.

407
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:03,781
Let's try this cable
one more time.

408
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:06,017
Putting in clear.

409
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:09,554
Got pieces of huge
rocks weighing it down.

410
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:10,822
All right, here we go.

411
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:12,457
I hope we don't break nothing.

412
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,560
The first time we've ever really
blown off that block up there.

413
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:18,262
Yeah, there's tension on it.

414
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:20,765
Fred, there's a lot of tension
on that rock.

415
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:22,787
Yeah. Well, just keep
that thing just like it is.

416
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:25,436
I just hope he's out of the way

417
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:27,839
'cause that rock goes over
his umbilical or anything else,

418
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:30,208
We're not getting him out.

419
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,876
All right.
Pull on it a little bit.

420
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:35,146
All right. Just pump it
a little bit more.

421
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:38,649
That's trying to come off.

422
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:40,118
All right, do it again.

423
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:41,953
Okay.

424
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:43,688
One, two, three.

425
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,425
Pumped off.

426
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:51,496
I don't know what to do.

427
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:53,931
It has not budged.

428
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,766
I just don't see
any other way to do it.

429
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:57,869
I'm gonna come out.

430
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:59,704
Diver's coming op,
diver's coming up.

431
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:04,142
<i>After a season record of
five-and-a-half hour dive...</i>

432
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:05,543
Good job, Fred.

433
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,578
<i>Fred finally admits defeat.</i>

434
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:11,048
Absolute disaster down.

435
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:14,886
It's at least four foot tall
from underneath it,

436
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:18,489
Over to the top of, yes,

437
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:19,857
Two big boulders.

438
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:22,927
I thought that we were
just gonna tip it over.

439
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:25,396
It didn't even move.

440
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:29,300
Well, you gave it a hell
of an effort, anyway.

441
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:30,402
We'll figure it out.

442
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:34,939
Just had to spend an awful
lot of time on that rock but.

443
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:37,742
In the end...

444
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:39,610
The rock one.

445
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:56,427
Well, good job today.

446
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,030
<i>Fred and his crew
returned to camp.</i>

447
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:00,364
<i>After more than five hours.</i>

448
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:03,234
<i>Spent battling
the monster boulder.</i>

449
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:06,904
I know the boulder didn't come out
of there, but you gave a hell anyway.

450
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:09,273
Yeah, we learned
about it anyway.

451
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,142
Yeah, it was a mother.

452
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:14,545
I gotta go talk
to Dustin anyway.

453
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,416
- Dustin's inside?
- He's inside.

454
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:20,284
Hey, Dustin, come see.

455
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:21,386
Hey, Fred.

456
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:23,188
What's doing on, man?

457
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:25,056
Man.

458
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:28,025
- Rough day?
- Yeah.

459
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:31,329
Hours of frustration today.

460
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:33,698
What you guys get into?

461
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,166
I'm dealing with a rock,

462
00:20:35,268 --> 00:20:38,836
About 3,000 lb. Rock that I don't
think I could get out of the hole.

463
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:40,638
I couldn't even break it loose.

464
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,773
- It's still on a wall.
- Yeah.

465
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:45,843
I refuse to let anybody go
down there till we get rid of it.

466
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:46,945
Is it undercut?

467
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:49,081
Yeah, a little bit.

468
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:50,381
I'll be damned.

469
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:51,716
It's pyramid shaped,

470
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:55,219
So it makes it hard
to try to hook it.

471
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:59,257
It's that toll from the top
to the bottom of it.

472
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:00,879
I need to bust that thing
or something.

473
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,394
Otherwise we're at a dead stop.

474
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:04,395
It's that bad?

475
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:06,130
- Well, yeah.
- Okay.

476
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:08,032
I mean, we can go out,
but we can't go down.

477
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:10,067
Because the thing is
hanging in the wall.

478
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:11,302
I see what you're saying.

479
00:21:11,404 --> 00:21:13,471
Standing up in the bottom
of the hole right now.

480
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:14,573
It's right there.

481
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:19,110
And if we go out or down
or whatever,

482
00:21:19,212 --> 00:21:21,212
Fall right over on it.

483
00:21:21,314 --> 00:21:24,248
So anyway, maybe,
what if the guys.

484
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,350
Could crack that thing?

485
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:29,420
All right. Um, yeah.

486
00:21:29,522 --> 00:21:31,166
We can come over
and crack that rock for you.

487
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,556
Well, that'd be great.

488
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:34,169
Yeah. You won't have to
worry about it.

489
00:21:34,193 --> 00:21:35,293
We got a technique down.

490
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:36,527
That's just beautiful now.

491
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,329
All right. Great.

492
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:39,830
But we have and underwater drill.

493
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:40,943
That's having a few problems.

494
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:42,533
It's a little fickle.

495
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:45,603
So it will be
either me or Carlos.

496
00:21:45,705 --> 00:21:47,204
That would drill with it.

497
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:49,907
Just if you let me have
your sight for just an hour,

498
00:21:51,044 --> 00:21:53,244
Then we'll pop it off and, bail.

499
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:58,349
If you let me have control
of your sight, we'll get it done.

500
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,552
All right.

501
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:02,953
Well, I appreciate it.

502
00:22:03,056 --> 00:22:05,167
- Could be weird to see...
- Do you see what that hat says on it?

503
00:22:05,191 --> 00:22:07,758
You see what that hat
says on it?

504
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,860
It says "dust."

505
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:14,298
You leave it laying around.

506
00:22:14,367 --> 00:22:15,566
- I just pick it up.
- Gosh.

507
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,368
- I know, I know.
- I just pick it up.

508
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:20,571
All right, so we'll come
crack a rock for you tomorrow.

509
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:23,674
After you see this,
you'll never go back.

510
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:26,844
Yeah, well, that's good, because
we got that one in the way.

511
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:30,348
And I can tell you
it kicked my ass today.

512
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,227
All right, then we'll see
you guys in the morning.

513
00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:33,484
See in the morning, Fred.

514
00:22:33,586 --> 00:22:36,053
Carlos, you're not using
my wetsuit.

515
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:37,421
I'm wearing your wetsuit, man.

516
00:22:39,092 --> 00:22:41,992
Tomorrow, I'm gonna go
crack rock for Fred hurt.

517
00:22:42,095 --> 00:22:43,828
He, must be desperate

518
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:46,764
'cause he asked me for help
for the first time.

519
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:50,067
Apparently stuck and there's a
big rock that he can't get under way.

520
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:53,237
We'll just go crack it
and move on.

521
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:55,939
Work with Fred for the first
time this year. It will be different.

522
00:23:00,113 --> 00:23:02,380
<i>Putting their hot streak
on the whole,</i>

523
00:23:02,482 --> 00:23:05,750
<i>Dustin and his crew
return to the trifecta.</i>

524
00:23:05,852 --> 00:23:07,885
<i>To help save fred's season.</i>

525
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:12,289
Dustin and his crew are coming
over here to help us with little rock.

526
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:13,924
They have some kind of a device.

527
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:16,093
That would help with our
little situation right now.

528
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,170
They claim it works great.

529
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:19,964
We'll see.

530
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:21,766
We'll get one of them
in the water,

531
00:23:21,868 --> 00:23:23,968
Let them go down
to do their thing.

532
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,237
Hopefully we're in and out
two hours, tops,

533
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:28,506
About how long I could
tolerate working with Fred.

534
00:23:28,608 --> 00:23:31,142
So in and out,
back to our own work.

535
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:33,177
We have a lot of work
to do this season,

536
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:35,746
So I can't spend
all this time with him.

537
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:37,948
He and I don't work
together that well, so.

538
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:49,093
We are here to save the day!

539
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:50,961
What's going on, Fred?

540
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:52,496
Hey, dust.

541
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,064
I can make it out.

542
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:56,200
<i>For the first time this year,</i>

543
00:23:56,302 --> 00:23:59,170
<i>Father and son
will work together.</i>

544
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:03,073
<i>As they try to remove a monster
widow maker from fred's hold.</i>

545
00:24:04,811 --> 00:24:07,311
Yeah, back to trifecta.

546
00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:09,407
Not 'cause I want to be here.

547
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:10,948
But I'm trying to help Fred.

548
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:14,051
A lot of things
I would change here,

549
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,520
But we're only gonna be here
for an hour or two.

550
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:17,622
It'll be just fine.

551
00:24:18,658 --> 00:24:20,491
There's a huge deposit
in that point.

552
00:24:20,593 --> 00:24:21,725
I can feel it.

553
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:23,127
<i>For two seasons,</i>

554
00:24:23,229 --> 00:24:27,131
<i>The Dakota boys mind
the trifecta side by side.</i>

555
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:29,667
Hey, Fred, can you believe it?

556
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:32,236
Hold that
and pull them together.

557
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:34,004
<i>But with Dustin in charge,</i>

558
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:36,440
<i>They fought over
where to dig for gold...</i>

559
00:24:37,777 --> 00:24:39,977
There's no reason
for me to be over there.

560
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:42,513
I think the gold is right there.

561
00:24:42,615 --> 00:24:44,081
It takes a little
more explaining.

562
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:46,050
To get it through
some thick gold.

563
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:47,418
What's going on?

564
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,554
How about coming up with a
better solution for your problem?

565
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,256
You're my problem, though.

566
00:24:52,358 --> 00:24:56,093
<i>Ending up with only thirteen
ounces for all their hard work...</i>

567
00:24:57,129 --> 00:24:58,462
No gold, no gold, no gold.

568
00:24:58,564 --> 00:25:01,732
<i>And leaving Dustin broke.</i>

569
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:05,269
I wasted a lot of time on this.
I won't be wasting any more.

570
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:08,439
This is the wall
that came up right here.

571
00:25:09,442 --> 00:25:10,508
All of this is gone.

572
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:12,009
All of that was solid.

573
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:13,777
It all washed away.

574
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,648
I think this is where I wanted
to come with the digger.

575
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,083
Wes talked to a psychic.

576
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:21,585
So a psychic told him
there's gold up there.

577
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,187
Fred decided it was over here.

578
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:25,155
I dug right in the middle, so.

579
00:25:27,093 --> 00:25:29,360
Everybody's wrong except...

580
00:25:29,462 --> 00:25:31,529
Well, I'm the only one
that's wrong here, so.

581
00:25:32,665 --> 00:25:34,865
I dug here twice two years.

582
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:37,201
And I don't wanna think about
how deep they have to go.

583
00:25:37,303 --> 00:25:39,537
If there's any gold,
it's gonna be on bedrock.

584
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:42,072
If he finds a big pocket,
he'll find more.

585
00:25:42,174 --> 00:25:44,008
But how did you notice
a pocket down there?

586
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:47,111
Onley Fred has an idea
of why he thinks that.

587
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:50,014
I hope he does well.
I just don't expect he will.

588
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:54,285
That is my light.

589
00:25:55,788 --> 00:25:57,087
That's mine.

590
00:25:57,189 --> 00:25:58,349
I've been looking all over...

591
00:25:58,424 --> 00:26:01,358
We tore everything
apart looking for this light.

592
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,626
Good. Glad you found it.

593
00:26:04,564 --> 00:26:05,763
Fred.

594
00:26:05,865 --> 00:26:09,199
We're back together again,
man, where it all started.

595
00:26:09,302 --> 00:26:11,035
Started off again, dude.

596
00:26:11,137 --> 00:26:13,604
It's the first time I'm getting
to work with you, beside you.

597
00:26:13,706 --> 00:26:15,172
This is awesome, dude.

598
00:26:15,274 --> 00:26:17,675
- Thanks for coming down here.
- This is freaking awesome.

599
00:26:17,777 --> 00:26:19,910
All right.
Today you're gonna dive,

600
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:21,979
Drill some holes,
place some power heads.

601
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:23,881
I know you guys.
This is your side.

602
00:26:23,983 --> 00:26:25,983
We're just gonna run
for just a little bit.

603
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:28,919
You pop a rock today.
Be in and out, right?

604
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:31,855
If everything goes well with
the drill, if she's not acting up.

605
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:33,857
- You talk nice to it.
- I gotta talk nice, man.

606
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,393
All right, I'll be on come
with Carlos.

607
00:26:36,495 --> 00:26:38,395
Try to keep down
on the cross talk.

608
00:26:38,497 --> 00:26:40,431
Because we don't do that
a lot. It freaks us out.

609
00:26:40,533 --> 00:26:41,966
- We don't either.
- Okay.

610
00:26:42,068 --> 00:26:44,268
So everybody know what to do?

611
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,669
All right, let's go.

612
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:48,906
Paul Ryan, Scott, you all go
down and get that dread running,

613
00:26:49,008 --> 00:26:50,674
And get everything
all ready to go.

614
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:51,776
Sounds good.

615
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:55,213
There she goes.

616
00:26:57,516 --> 00:26:59,483
That's almost like,
you know, a large regular.

617
00:26:59,585 --> 00:27:01,518
Yep. Makes me feel like
a big boy.

618
00:27:01,621 --> 00:27:03,821
Yeah, man, you're diving
with the big boys today.

619
00:27:03,923 --> 00:27:04,923
Yeah.

620
00:27:06,158 --> 00:27:08,759
- Okay. Appreciate that, man.
- No problem.

621
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:09,972
Let me tell you a story, Ryan.

622
00:27:09,996 --> 00:27:11,362
This is where I was born.

623
00:27:12,898 --> 00:27:14,810
I'm happy, man, because we're
all working back together again.

624
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:16,033
This is how I started off.

625
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:18,869
This is where I learned
to dredge, right here.

626
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,337
It feels good to be back, man.

627
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:23,607
<i>While Carlos prepares to die,</i>

628
00:27:23,709 --> 00:27:25,476
<i>Wes readies the power heads.</i>

629
00:27:25,578 --> 00:27:28,646
<i>And the charges
that will blast the rock.</i>

630
00:27:28,748 --> 00:27:30,481
There's one that's ready to go.

631
00:27:30,583 --> 00:27:32,182
Pretty slick, if you ask me.

632
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:35,019
Well, this thing took care of
our hippo boulder, that's for sure.

633
00:27:35,121 --> 00:27:37,187
This boulder, this,
Fred and these guys got.

634
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:40,257
Is probably a little bit bigger
than the hippo boulder maybe.

635
00:27:41,394 --> 00:27:43,327
So, this is going to
be interesting.

636
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:45,596
We may have to do a double.

637
00:27:45,698 --> 00:27:49,233
We might have to blow it once
and crack part of it off.

638
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:51,535
And then,
set up and do it again.

639
00:27:52,705 --> 00:27:54,071
Get this. Yeah.

640
00:27:57,143 --> 00:27:59,076
I'll wait for you then. Yep.

641
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:00,544
I guess you walk in this way.

642
00:28:00,646 --> 00:28:03,047
All right, guys.

643
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:05,716
Come right on it.

644
00:28:05,818 --> 00:28:08,585
I want to give you
some last minute air.

645
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:10,688
You're right on the verge
of stopping off.

646
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,790
Into a ten-foot hole. Okay.

647
00:28:12,892 --> 00:28:14,224
Or twelve-foot hole.

648
00:28:14,326 --> 00:28:16,326
The hole is about
where that rock is,

649
00:28:16,429 --> 00:28:18,996
Just pull out of the way
into that way to the ladder.

650
00:28:19,098 --> 00:28:20,998
You'll run right into
that big rock.

651
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,300
Go on. Perimeter check.

652
00:28:23,402 --> 00:28:24,768
Yep. I'm doing
a perimeter check.

653
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,471
- Thank you.
- Absolutely. Bye then.

654
00:28:27,573 --> 00:28:30,307
Sorry, Fred, you're really loud,
and I could barely hear him.

655
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:32,242
You close my eardrums out
when you talk.

656
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:35,913
Got the hold. Yeah.

657
00:28:39,018 --> 00:28:41,618
You can see the rock
right there, right there.

658
00:28:41,721 --> 00:28:44,088
Carlos, he's gonna keep trying
to tell you what to do.

659
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:46,023
Until you he makes out
what you're doing.

660
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:47,825
It better be coming over there.

661
00:28:47,927 --> 00:28:49,860
Hey, Fred. He's gonna do
a perimeter check.

662
00:28:49,962 --> 00:28:52,463
To make sure nothing's gonna
fall on him from the top.

663
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:53,864
Yeah, I got it.

664
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:56,767
For the first time, this
feels like work this year.

665
00:28:56,869 --> 00:28:58,001
I love doing what I do.

666
00:28:58,104 --> 00:28:59,670
I don't know why
this feels like work.

667
00:29:12,485 --> 00:29:13,884
Okay.

668
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:15,652
I see it. I see it!

669
00:29:15,755 --> 00:29:17,521
<i>At the trifecta,</i>

670
00:29:17,623 --> 00:29:21,358
<i>Dustin and his crew have
come to his father's rescue.</i>

671
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:24,361
<i>If they can use their new rock
splitting technique.</i>

672
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:27,931
<i>To demolish fred's unmovable
giant boulder.</i>

673
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:31,034
<i>Then Fred can carry on
digging down to bedrock gold.</i>

674
00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:33,637
What the hell, man?

675
00:29:33,706 --> 00:29:36,206
This rock is bigger
than a hippo.

676
00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:38,876
<i>But this sunken behemoth
is bigger than.</i>

677
00:29:38,978 --> 00:29:40,744
<i>Anything he's dealt with before.</i>

678
00:29:40,846 --> 00:29:42,546
Okay.

679
00:29:42,648 --> 00:29:46,683
Let's see how do I want
to blow this up.

680
00:29:46,786 --> 00:29:49,486
That might take
a couple of blasts.

681
00:29:49,588 --> 00:29:50,921
It's a pretty big rock.

682
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:53,857
- That sounds fun.
- Yeah.

683
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:56,393
Let's just blow it
to smithereens.

684
00:29:56,495 --> 00:29:57,394
Yep.

685
00:29:57,496 --> 00:29:59,496
He realized how big
that rock is there.

686
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:00,998
- Pretty good-sized rock.
- Good.

687
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,332
That's great, man.

688
00:30:02,434 --> 00:30:04,001
Where to get better, man?

689
00:30:04,103 --> 00:30:05,463
All right,
I'm going to the ladder.

690
00:30:05,538 --> 00:30:07,137
And I'm going to get my drill.

691
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:09,373
- I'll wait for you.
- Okay.

692
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:11,008
Thank you, sir.

693
00:30:15,247 --> 00:30:18,515
<i>Carlos will use the
pressurized underwater drill.</i>

694
00:30:18,617 --> 00:30:22,719
<i>To bore three 13-inch holes
in the monster boulder.</i>

695
00:30:22,855 --> 00:30:25,222
<i>He will then insert
the blast rods.</i>

696
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:28,292
<i>When the trigger is pushed,</i>

697
00:30:28,394 --> 00:30:31,128
<i>The detonation
will cause a shock wave.</i>

698
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:33,831
<i>That will crack the boulder
from the inside out.</i>

699
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,670
Come on.

700
00:30:39,738 --> 00:30:41,305
Don't mess with me today.

701
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:43,507
- Still working?
- Yeah.

702
00:30:43,609 --> 00:30:44,875
There's just this one big,

703
00:30:44,977 --> 00:30:45,809
It's coming at
a different angle.

704
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:48,579
I'm gonna need
a little bit of time.

705
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:51,748
Carlos is down there,
drilling the rock right now,

706
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:54,051
Hopefully he can crack
that and get it out of our way.

707
00:30:54,153 --> 00:30:56,673
We need to get down and that
thing's right in our way right now.

708
00:30:59,658 --> 00:31:01,024
Did that hit?

709
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:01,992
Did it get hit?

710
00:31:02,094 --> 00:31:03,794
It's not hit it.

711
00:31:03,896 --> 00:31:06,697
You know what, you're gonna
have to give me a smaller drill bit.

712
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,432
Copy that. Smaller drill bit.

713
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:11,034
- We got it coming.
- Okay.

714
00:31:11,136 --> 00:31:12,769
Sorry I didn't see this coming.

715
00:31:12,872 --> 00:31:14,238
No, no. No worries.

716
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:17,841
<i>Carlos is struggling with the
smooth surface of the boulder.</i>

717
00:31:17,943 --> 00:31:19,576
<i>His solution?</i>

718
00:31:19,678 --> 00:31:22,646
<i>Drive a pilot hole
with a smaller drill bit.</i>

719
00:31:22,748 --> 00:31:25,883
<i>Before coming back
and enlarging its hole.</i>

720
00:31:31,423 --> 00:31:35,225
<i>But all the drilling is eating
up their battery power.</i>

721
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:37,394
The driller we have
batteries aren't the best.

722
00:31:37,496 --> 00:31:40,597
Run out really quickly
and I'll have to up.

723
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:43,800
<i>Throw one charge,
and sometimes it works.</i>

724
00:31:43,903 --> 00:31:45,202
<i>Sometimes it doesn't done.</i>

725
00:31:45,304 --> 00:31:47,571
It's not perfect,
but it's doing the job.

726
00:31:47,673 --> 00:31:50,407
That nothing else
could do, nothing else.

727
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:56,747
Good checks. Wanna second home?

728
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:01,618
Dustin, what happened?

729
00:32:05,691 --> 00:32:07,457
<i>Copy that will pull up.</i>

730
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:09,526
<i>Batteries won't last one now.</i>

731
00:32:09,628 --> 00:32:11,328
<i>Good choice that immediately.</i>

732
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,063
<i>We need one batteries man.</i>

733
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:14,331
<i>Use it wisely.</i>

734
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:20,070
<i>Okay.</i>

735
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:25,609
- Does it quit?
- No, no, no.

736
00:32:25,711 --> 00:32:27,744
Freaking not.
Lots of hole in that.

737
00:32:29,982 --> 00:32:31,949
<i>Okay. That's second hole now.</i>

738
00:32:32,051 --> 00:32:33,250
<i>Plus for the third one.</i>

739
00:32:33,352 --> 00:32:35,519
<i>Yup. Definitely its
the third one.</i>

740
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:38,488
- Does he get couple of them?
- He's got.

741
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:42,259
Three, I thinking right now.
But they are not that deep.

742
00:32:42,361 --> 00:32:44,161
They need to be
thirteen and a half.

743
00:32:44,263 --> 00:32:45,662
They had the
worst damn batteries.

744
00:32:45,764 --> 00:32:47,030
You have to see.

745
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:52,402
I want to pull him up,
but, you know we're in Alaska.

746
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:53,971
Yeah.

747
00:32:55,774 --> 00:32:57,941
Okay. Drill be changed.

748
00:32:58,043 --> 00:32:59,083
Got it which one you want?

749
00:32:59,111 --> 00:33:01,578
- Long one?
- Yes, get the long one.

750
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,746
All right, long one.

751
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:08,151
<i>He's gonna drill this, but you can
with the battery life that we have.</i>

752
00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:10,554
<i>Hopefully we can
crack this rock.</i>

753
00:33:11,423 --> 00:33:13,256
It works perfect the first time.

754
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:16,560
We don't have to go
back down and drill it again.

755
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:21,331
That's one pal.

756
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:23,033
- One?
- Yeah.

757
00:33:23,135 --> 00:33:25,635
Someone give a cup of coffee.

758
00:33:25,738 --> 00:33:28,905
I don't wanna be doing it.
Make me some coffee.

759
00:33:29,008 --> 00:33:31,541
<i>Yeah, I tried to tell him,
but he didn't want to hear it.</i>

760
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:36,480
- Third box?
- Yeah.

761
00:33:36,582 --> 00:33:38,749
I'm gonna bring
this drill up there.

762
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:40,751
Step by, step by, hold on.

763
00:33:40,853 --> 00:33:43,553
Laid out again,
I'm having trouble with radio.

764
00:33:44,923 --> 00:33:47,591
Sorry manager, I can't hear it,

765
00:33:49,061 --> 00:33:50,927
I used to all this noise.

766
00:33:51,964 --> 00:33:53,475
They're so used
to talking to each other,

767
00:33:53,499 --> 00:33:56,566
Over these things
that they just must kill.

768
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:58,301
It would Carlos to flip out.

769
00:33:58,404 --> 00:34:01,338
I guess he's only here for an
hour, but after five hours he loses.

770
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,006
He'd be like,
"shut up, everybody.

771
00:34:03,108 --> 00:34:05,242
That's enough
talking to each other."

772
00:34:06,678 --> 00:34:10,013
<i>All right, wanna hurry up,
will get you.</i>

773
00:34:12,951 --> 00:34:16,920
I love you guys. Don't yell.
I used to do it. Can you all?

774
00:34:17,022 --> 00:34:18,302
Let's just go
talk to each other.

775
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:24,734
- I'm messing some?
- Yeah, he's getting mad, because of the cross talk.

776
00:34:25,964 --> 00:34:27,898
<i>What do you need?</i>

777
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,699
<i>He's working on all down there.</i>

778
00:34:29,802 --> 00:34:31,001
<i>Just let him be, yeah?</i>

779
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,239
I got a lot of memories here
at trifecta.

780
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:38,642
Not a lot of them good.

781
00:34:40,646 --> 00:34:41,812
I didn't really succeed here.

782
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:43,915
I'm done with this place.

783
00:34:44,016 --> 00:34:46,450
Fred's not,
but I'm done with this place.

784
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,886
Got a lot of time and
effort put into this,

785
00:34:49,988 --> 00:34:53,256
Very spot where
I'm standing right now.

786
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:57,928
<i>I've got hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds of hours of moving rocks.</i>

787
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,529
I didn't ever think
I'd be back here.

788
00:35:02,134 --> 00:35:03,134
You're right.

789
00:35:11,477 --> 00:35:13,610
- Stop, don't you guys stuck?
- No, no, no.

790
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:16,024
No, must get us side, I tried
to pull it out as quick as I can.

791
00:35:16,048 --> 00:35:18,215
I think I get one more matter.

792
00:35:18,317 --> 00:35:21,051
Just a bit so freaking long.

793
00:35:21,153 --> 00:35:25,288
I can't get no stability man.
I think give some force.

794
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:34,297
I mean I was power hit.

795
00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:36,199
Power!

796
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:37,501
<i>Power it!</i>

797
00:35:37,603 --> 00:35:39,236
Now, I'm gonna have some fun.

798
00:35:40,272 --> 00:35:42,139
- You got all three drills?
- -yeah.

799
00:35:42,274 --> 00:35:45,642
- [ I'm able to see...
- ]

800
00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:48,211
<i>No problem, we
delicate with these things.</i>

801
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:51,114
- You've got three, I guess. Right?
- Yeah.

802
00:35:51,216 --> 00:35:53,517
Looks like this three and
then, we'll go from there.

803
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:57,821
Get ready for arrive, first debt
as we call it for the first detonation.

804
00:35:57,923 --> 00:35:59,923
<i>I'm really excited.
This should be pretty cool.</i>

805
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:03,860
You gotta plug one of them in?

806
00:36:03,962 --> 00:36:05,529
Yeah.

807
00:36:05,631 --> 00:36:07,264
I want to plug it into the cord.

808
00:36:08,433 --> 00:36:09,933
Just what we're plugging one.

809
00:36:11,436 --> 00:36:13,314
<i>All right? You should
be able to get there now.</i>

810
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:14,704
Just follow me down with that.

811
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:16,306
<i>Follow him down.
Just tended down.</i>

812
00:36:16,408 --> 00:36:17,807
- Whatever he say.
- I will.

813
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:19,709
<i>Let's see what we have got here.</i>

814
00:36:21,046 --> 00:36:22,279
<i>Yeah.</i>

815
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:24,447
<i>Perfect?</i>

816
00:36:26,218 --> 00:36:28,818
<i>Carlos is putting a bow here,
into the rock.</i>

817
00:36:28,921 --> 00:36:31,054
<i>It's kind of a delicate thing.</i>

818
00:36:31,156 --> 00:36:34,691
<i>And I was gonna plug him all
up, and we gotta yank him out.</i>

819
00:36:34,793 --> 00:36:38,195
Can't be underneath water
we expand the rock because,

820
00:36:38,297 --> 00:36:39,796
Well, that are
knocking him out..

821
00:36:45,404 --> 00:36:46,703
<i>All right, power get three.</i>

822
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:48,238
Can you hear me?

823
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,839
<i>Get for that trigger.</i>

824
00:36:49,942 --> 00:36:52,976
<i>We will. Take it easy man.</i>

825
00:37:01,587 --> 00:37:04,020
Okay. Someone got slowing.

826
00:37:09,962 --> 00:37:12,062
<i>All right, man.
Everything is good.</i>

827
00:37:12,164 --> 00:37:13,164
Comin up.

828
00:37:13,232 --> 00:37:15,198
<i>The power heads now inserted.</i>

829
00:37:15,267 --> 00:37:17,000
<i>Ready for detonation.</i>

830
00:37:17,102 --> 00:37:19,402
<i>Carlos clears the blast zone.</i>

831
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:22,105
We will get some beer,
everything's good.

832
00:37:22,207 --> 00:37:23,907
Good job man.

833
00:37:24,009 --> 00:37:25,108
All right, everyone.

834
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:28,178
No one could be
under this clip right here.

835
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,547
No one could be under that clip.

836
00:37:30,649 --> 00:37:32,682
The sides of these
mountains are so rotten.

837
00:37:32,784 --> 00:37:34,618
<i>It doesn't take much to
get him to fall.</i>

838
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,487
So we clear everybody out,
away from all the rock danger.

839
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:40,457
If this thing does, call the
rocket ball everybody clear.

840
00:37:41,293 --> 00:37:42,192
Fred.

841
00:37:42,294 --> 00:37:43,994
You're gonna do a detonations.

842
00:37:44,096 --> 00:37:46,529
Wes, set you up. And
this is your trigger, Fred.

843
00:37:47,366 --> 00:37:48,431
Yeah. I got you.

844
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:50,533
- Is there everybody secure?
- Yeah.

845
00:37:52,671 --> 00:37:53,881
All right, wes,
you're up, buddy?

846
00:37:53,905 --> 00:37:55,138
<i>Going hot.</i>

847
00:37:57,175 --> 00:37:58,455
Give it hell, Fred.
Give it hell.

848
00:37:58,543 --> 00:38:00,143
Going hot right now.

849
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:02,245
<i>Everybody just makes you
nothing falls on you.</i>

850
00:38:03,548 --> 00:38:04,781
<i>Okay we are hot.</i>

851
00:38:04,883 --> 00:38:06,082
Ready, whenever you are Fred.

852
00:38:06,184 --> 00:38:07,884
All right.

853
00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:10,587
<i>I'm just seeing what 
his little baby does there.</i>

854
00:38:10,689 --> 00:38:12,055
Fred about to head it.

855
00:38:12,157 --> 00:38:13,723
- Off the works.
- Yeah.

856
00:38:13,825 --> 00:38:16,259
<i>Nine, eight, seven,</i>

857
00:38:16,361 --> 00:38:18,728
<i>Six, five, four,</i>

858
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:21,464
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

859
00:38:21,566 --> 00:38:23,099
<i>Contact.</i>

860
00:38:35,514 --> 00:38:38,275
Hopefully it's sittin' in the bottom
of the hole and pieces right now.

861
00:38:39,284 --> 00:38:41,051
That ten countdown was
a little excessive,

862
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:42,018
But that's all right.

863
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,687
I thought he only went to five.

864
00:38:43,789 --> 00:38:44,988
I thought I would do three.

865
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:46,790
That's all I ever do
three, two, one.

866
00:38:46,892 --> 00:38:49,125
That's enough.

867
00:38:50,529 --> 00:38:51,839
<i>Starting countdown
from one thousand.</i>

868
00:38:51,863 --> 00:38:55,565
<i>One hundred, fifty,
twenty five, one, go.</i>

869
00:39:03,575 --> 00:39:06,376
Three, two, one.

870
00:39:06,478 --> 00:39:07,677
Contact.

871
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:14,284
<i>I felt it, definitely
shook the ground.</i>

872
00:39:14,386 --> 00:39:16,953
There it goes, there,
bubbling up right now.

873
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:21,458
I gotta hope it broke
that rock into pieces.

874
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:25,328
Man, it sounded like
it was blowing up back there.

875
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:28,631
<i>All right? It is safe for the
diver to go back in the water.</i>

876
00:39:28,734 --> 00:39:30,300
<i>After blasting the boulder.</i>

877
00:39:31,303 --> 00:39:33,169
Give her hell, Carlos.

878
00:39:34,973 --> 00:39:39,042
<i>Carlos dives back down to
see if the mission was a success.</i>

879
00:39:39,144 --> 00:39:41,277
Hey, Carlos, did you
blow up the whole thing?

880
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,513
Aah, man!

881
00:39:47,953 --> 00:39:49,886
<i>Does it need another,
blast or what?</i>

882
00:39:54,226 --> 00:39:59,763
<i>To make the sites safe, Carlos
will have to repeat the process.</i>

883
00:39:59,865 --> 00:40:04,033
You get a little right, that thing,
I think, would really help us out.

884
00:40:06,171 --> 00:40:07,804
This isn't gonna last long.

885
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:09,572
Coming. Coming.

886
00:40:10,475 --> 00:40:12,442
<i>This is taking longer
than we thought.</i>

887
00:40:12,511 --> 00:40:15,044
A little worried that he's
not gone a be able to do this.

888
00:40:15,147 --> 00:40:17,213
We can't afford to
spend all our time here.

889
00:40:17,315 --> 00:40:19,115
We have to get back
to our own job.

890
00:40:19,217 --> 00:40:20,316
Got one big beef left.

891
00:40:20,419 --> 00:40:21,819
They're going to
blow that one, too.

892
00:40:25,857 --> 00:40:28,925
- Carlos?
- -That really a hot.

893
00:40:29,027 --> 00:40:30,693
You're kidding me!

894
00:40:30,796 --> 00:40:32,996
No.

895
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:35,465
<i>Did it quit?</i>

896
00:40:35,567 --> 00:40:37,500
<i>It stopped altogether.</i>

897
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:39,869
<i>Come on baby. Just doing good.</i>

898
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:42,772
<i>Hold on. Okay. Perfect.</i>

899
00:40:42,874 --> 00:40:44,374
Okay.

900
00:40:45,343 --> 00:40:46,654
<i>That's what
I'm telling you, man.</i>

901
00:40:46,678 --> 00:40:49,279
<i>This thing has a mind
of its own, man.</i>

902
00:40:49,381 --> 00:40:51,781
<i>I know, you got trade it right.</i>

903
00:40:51,883 --> 00:40:55,752
I just don't wanna curse
it man, you can do it, girl.

904
00:40:55,854 --> 00:40:59,355
It's running barely,
but it's running.

905
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:01,491
<i>Their batteries almost drained.</i>

906
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:04,961
<i>Carlos attempts a second hole.</i>

907
00:41:05,063 --> 00:41:06,963
- Your batteries are almost dead.
- I know.

908
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:09,726
We'll see if the
battery makes it., man.

909
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:13,470
That's right. Battery stops.

910
00:41:13,572 --> 00:41:15,783
<i>I think you put that one more
power head in the right place.</i>

911
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:18,408
Let's going out.

912
00:41:19,711 --> 00:41:23,313
<i>Instead of drilling
three holes, like before.</i>

913
00:41:23,415 --> 00:41:26,649
<i>Carlos is hoping they can
blast the rest of the rock,</i>

914
00:41:26,751 --> 00:41:28,718
<i>With a single charge.</i>

915
00:41:29,588 --> 00:41:30,487
Perfect.

916
00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:33,990
<i>All right, plugged in,
wire secured.</i>

917
00:41:34,092 --> 00:41:35,625
<i>Okay. We're good.</i>

918
00:41:35,727 --> 00:41:38,528
- Come on up.
- Okay. Coming up.

919
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:41,231
All right. Fred's getting you
a countdown, fellows,

920
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:43,373
He wants you to go from
one hundred this time, Fred.

921
00:41:44,336 --> 00:41:46,803
- Let's do it Fred.
- All right.

922
00:41:46,905 --> 00:41:49,439
Carlos, you got the
rock all set up, so free two.

923
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:54,010
Six, five, four, three,

924
00:41:54,112 --> 00:41:57,046
Two, one.

925
00:41:58,817 --> 00:42:01,985
Damn! That's louder.

926
00:42:04,556 --> 00:42:05,722
Open that did it.

927
00:42:10,095 --> 00:42:11,227
Well, what's the damage?

928
00:42:11,296 --> 00:42:14,163
- Carlos.
- What is done.

929
00:42:14,266 --> 00:42:16,900
It's gone dude. Cut into pieces.

930
00:42:17,002 --> 00:42:19,135
Back now.

931
00:42:19,237 --> 00:42:21,237
<i>I job here is done, guys.</i>

932
00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:23,873
All right, we're done here.

933
00:42:23,975 --> 00:42:26,709
Nice work fellas.
Really nice. Really nice.

934
00:42:26,811 --> 00:42:27,877
Appreciated.

935
00:42:27,979 --> 00:42:29,212
I got something for Fred.

936
00:42:34,286 --> 00:42:36,052
That's some smallest piece.

937
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:40,557
- Good job.
- How much fun was that?

938
00:42:40,659 --> 00:42:42,692
That was pretty fun.

939
00:42:42,794 --> 00:42:44,394
It's a whole new game changer.

940
00:42:44,496 --> 00:42:45,929
Man.

941
00:42:46,031 --> 00:42:49,232
I'm gonna send hole down
there right away to fill up fast start.

942
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:51,868
Hell, yeah. Good job.

943
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:53,937
- All right, man.
- I got to go, man.

944
00:42:54,039 --> 00:42:56,839
Good man,
it's all up to you now.

945
00:42:58,276 --> 00:42:59,754
I'm pretty excited to
see what it did.

946
00:42:59,778 --> 00:43:02,211
Easy peasy, amigos.

947
00:43:02,314 --> 00:43:03,413
<i>Good job man.</i>

948
00:43:03,515 --> 00:43:05,949
This is the blast for the
past for me bro. This is...

949
00:43:06,051 --> 00:43:09,919
- A literal blast.
- Yeah. A literal blast.

950
00:43:10,021 --> 00:43:12,422
We gotta get back to our site
and get diving.

951
00:43:13,291 --> 00:43:14,490
Fred is big stuff.

952
00:43:15,594 --> 00:43:16,594
Hi, Fred.

953
00:43:17,529 --> 00:43:18,561
Yeah.

954
00:43:19,664 --> 00:43:21,331
All right. Stop appreciating.

955
00:43:21,433 --> 00:43:22,865
Absolute Fred.

956
00:43:22,968 --> 00:43:24,334
We're dead in the water.

957
00:43:24,436 --> 00:43:26,636
Awesome, man.
I'm glad we could help.

958
00:43:26,738 --> 00:43:27,770
- So...
- Thanks a lot.

959
00:43:27,872 --> 00:43:29,339
- Now. All right.
- All right, Fred.

960
00:43:29,441 --> 00:43:30,773
- Later.
- Good luck.

961
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:32,342
Yep. Thank now.

962
00:43:32,444 --> 00:43:33,610
You're welcome.

963
00:43:33,712 --> 00:43:36,245
- See you man.
- Thanks buddy.

964
00:43:36,348 --> 00:43:39,248
Fred was thankful.
I'm glad we could help him.

965
00:43:39,351 --> 00:43:41,351
It's still a little hard
to work with Fred.

966
00:43:41,453 --> 00:43:44,053
He and I have history,
but we behave today.

967
00:43:44,155 --> 00:43:45,355
We had a good time at the end.

968
00:43:45,423 --> 00:43:46,489
He said, thank you.

969
00:43:46,591 --> 00:43:47,457
That's a big deal.

970
00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:48,799
Apparently, that's a huge deal.

971
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:52,128
When Fred says thank you,
he's never really done before.

972
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:55,365
I was glad to have dusted and his
crew come down here and help us out.

973
00:43:55,467 --> 00:43:57,600
This was excellent
teamwork here.

974
00:43:57,702 --> 00:43:58,968
We had a great day today.

975
00:43:59,904 --> 00:44:01,115
<i>Let's get our diver
in the water now.</i>

976
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:03,840
<i>We got some gold to find.</i>

977
00:44:03,942 --> 00:44:08,111
<i>Fred's nemesis boulder
successfully reduced to rubble.</i>

978
00:44:08,213 --> 00:44:12,482
<i>He and his crew can get back to
digging down to the bedrock gold.</i>

979
00:44:16,454 --> 00:44:18,254
Ready to go.

980
00:44:18,356 --> 00:44:19,589
<i>Wow.</i>

981
00:44:19,691 --> 00:44:21,057
What do you think?

982
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:23,626
<i>Wow, that worked amazingly good.</i>

983
00:44:23,728 --> 00:44:25,528
<i>Just a bunch of basket rocks.</i>

984
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:28,364
<i>That's definitely took care
of all that from.</i>

985
00:44:28,466 --> 00:44:29,666
<i>All have gone down there,</i>

986
00:44:29,768 --> 00:44:31,734
<i>To pick up a patients.</i>

987
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:35,772
Now hole a biggest gigantic
3500 pound rock,

988
00:44:35,874 --> 00:44:37,373
Is 20 pound rock.

989
00:44:37,475 --> 00:44:38,475
A lot of trouble.

990
00:44:39,511 --> 00:44:41,544
All right,
I think I got full run basket.

991
00:44:41,646 --> 00:44:42,979
I will be down.

992
00:44:43,081 --> 00:44:44,714
<i>On a move.</i>

993
00:44:47,285 --> 00:44:49,686
<i>Wow. It's just tons of
broken rocks.</i>

994
00:44:50,722 --> 00:44:52,588
Now they look down there, Paul?

995
00:44:52,691 --> 00:44:54,924
It's looking pretty good.
It broke up most of that rock.

996
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:56,666
- It's a lot more manageable now.
- Great.

997
00:44:56,761 --> 00:44:59,629
<i>There are little stuff
I gotta get filled out,</i>

998
00:44:59,731 --> 00:45:02,632
<i>There is big pile of
rock down here.</i>

999
00:45:02,734 --> 00:45:07,904
They got the best way going up.

1000
00:45:08,006 --> 00:45:09,338
Woh, this is going up.

1001
00:45:13,445 --> 00:45:15,144
A big, jagged one there.

1002
00:45:15,246 --> 00:45:17,280
Yeah. Wow.

1003
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:19,348
And I'm looking at
a really nice piece of gold.

1004
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:22,285
Nice.

1005
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:24,854
- Sounds good to me.
- Do you think you can grab it?

1006
00:45:24,956 --> 00:45:27,401
Yeah. You better believe me
man. I don't believe this down here.

1007
00:45:27,425 --> 00:45:29,158
It was over there by
that bus in rock.

1008
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:30,827
Very nice.

1009
00:45:30,929 --> 00:45:32,695
Careful with it now.

1010
00:45:32,797 --> 00:45:33,896
Holy.

1011
00:45:33,998 --> 00:45:35,631
That's a damn nice
piece of gold Paul.

1012
00:45:35,734 --> 00:45:37,934
Let's see what he got.

1013
00:45:39,537 --> 00:45:41,804
Yeah. Nice little picker.

1014
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:45,174
Any time you move a big rock,
you want to look around that thing.

1015
00:45:45,276 --> 00:45:46,809
And see if you got gold running.

1016
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:48,578
I know we're not
on the bottom yet,

1017
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:52,448
But it's nice to
really find a lot.

1018
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:53,583
And more spot.

1019
00:45:53,685 --> 00:45:56,285
There's gotta be more here.

1020
00:45:56,387 --> 00:45:58,387
Hell yeah, buddy.

1021
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:00,823
You get the glory,
fine all that boom.

1022
00:46:03,995 --> 00:46:07,130
Gotta open up
a real estate abroad.

1023
00:46:07,232 --> 00:46:09,899
All right? Good enough.
Come on out.

1024
00:46:13,671 --> 00:46:14,904
<i>Yeah. Nice job, buddy.</i>

1025
00:46:16,074 --> 00:46:17,434
There's definitely
gold down there.

1026
00:46:17,509 --> 00:46:19,976
And now with that rock out of
the way, we can keep chasing it.

1027
00:46:21,045 --> 00:46:22,278
Sucked anything else up?

1028
00:46:27,819 --> 00:46:29,152
Holy.

1029
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:30,820
Holy.

1030
00:46:30,922 --> 00:46:31,821
Yeah.

1031
00:46:31,923 --> 00:46:33,523
You might want to come
and take a look.

1032
00:46:33,625 --> 00:46:35,825
- What you got?
- I see a piece!

1033
00:46:35,927 --> 00:46:37,794
<i>Yeah. Look at those pieces.</i>

1034
00:46:37,896 --> 00:46:40,096
Wo!!

1035
00:46:42,867 --> 00:46:46,435
There we go. Good job. Damn.

1036
00:46:48,439 --> 00:46:51,073
Wow. I wasn't expecting that.

1037
00:46:51,176 --> 00:46:52,608
<i>In a single dive,</i>

1038
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:56,212
<i>They have collected more gold
than they have found all season.</i>

1039
00:46:57,615 --> 00:46:58,881
This is very nice.

1040
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:00,183
It's encouraging.

1041
00:47:00,285 --> 00:47:02,351
I love seeing this stuff.

1042
00:47:02,453 --> 00:47:07,089
When you see this, then it makes it,
pretty much worthwhile what we're doing.

1043
00:47:07,192 --> 00:47:09,759
<i>Now after seeing that we're
definitely in the right spot.</i>

1044
00:47:09,861 --> 00:47:14,664
I have been so many times
and disappointed so many times.

1045
00:47:14,766 --> 00:47:16,699
Yes. We knew there was
something there.

1046
00:47:16,801 --> 00:47:20,136
To find something
like this is encouraging.

1047
00:47:20,238 --> 00:47:21,838
I'm a happy man today.

1048
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:25,975
It may not be an old man
following pretties folly.

1049
00:47:26,077 --> 00:47:29,045
It might be pretty fortunate,
you know?

1050
00:47:37,922 --> 00:47:39,922
<i>On the next</i>
gold rush: White water...

1051
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:41,324
<i>It's time to get back to work.</i>

1052
00:47:41,426 --> 00:47:42,426
<i>Time to go diving.</i>

1053
00:47:48,499 --> 00:47:49,365
<i>What happened?</i>

1054
00:47:49,467 --> 00:47:51,701
Out of air. Out of air.

1055
00:47:51,803 --> 00:47:53,569
The engine quit
on the other side.

1056
00:47:53,671 --> 00:47:56,806
I can't mentally deal with it.

1057
00:47:56,908 --> 00:47:58,040
I'm finished.

1058
00:47:58,142 --> 00:47:59,041
Whoa.

1059
00:47:59,143 --> 00:48:00,243
Yeeha!
