1
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:10,721
- You guys ready for a good day?
- Ready!

2
00:00:10,745 --> 00:00:14,224
In southeast Alaskaâ€™s
remote wilderness,

3
00:00:14,248 --> 00:00:16,093
Mckinley creek...

4
00:00:16,117 --> 00:00:17,916
Alright, he's going in.

5
00:00:19,053 --> 00:00:20,919
- Yeah!
- Whoo-hoo!

6
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:25,435
Halfway through a season.

7
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:28,271
Shortened by
the covid pandemic...

8
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:31,274
- Can you see anything at all?
- Yeah, I can see fine.

9
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:33,677
Dustin and his crew.

10
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:37,214
Are pulling up thousands
of dollars of nuggets.

11
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:40,684
The old-timers
could never access.

12
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,285
Holy crap!

13
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:43,720
What the hell, Dustin?

14
00:00:43,744 --> 00:00:45,689
Yeah, yeah, you're welcome.

15
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:46,957
This boulder's heavy.

16
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:49,192
The more boulders
that's coming out of there.

17
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:50,527
Means good things.

18
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,329
More boulders, more gold.

19
00:00:52,353 --> 00:00:55,365
That's funny how that works.
I like it.

20
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:59,903
Last week, the crew
cleaned up 14.2 ounces...

21
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:03,473
- Whoa!
- This place is a mess down here.

22
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:06,443
I got plenty of work to do.

23
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:08,445
More gold than they've ever had.

24
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:10,235
At this point of the season.

25
00:01:14,175 --> 00:01:16,820
What the.

26
00:01:16,844 --> 00:01:18,555
Well, I'll be damned.

27
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:22,159
There's a granite boulder rock
down here.

28
00:01:22,183 --> 00:01:24,061
17 around.

29
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:26,596
- Really?
- Yeah.

30
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:31,902
A rock this size
can weigh over 10,000 pounds.

31
00:01:31,926 --> 00:01:34,871
We have to find a different way
to deal with that.

32
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:38,508
I'm not sure our skyline
will handle a rock that big.

33
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:42,279
- The colossal boulder.
- The Jurassic boulder.

34
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:44,181
You guys and your names.

35
00:01:44,205 --> 00:01:46,171
- Hippo rock.
- Hippo?

36
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:50,253
- I like that.
- That's a perfect name.

37
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:53,123
That thing is like a
hippo, and it wants to kill you.

38
00:01:53,147 --> 00:01:55,492
You know what I mean?
So it's not one of those.

39
00:01:55,516 --> 00:01:56,760
Purple hippos that, like,

40
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:58,161
Frickin' sing and dance
kind of deal.

41
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:01,231
It's a purple hippo
that wants to kill you.

42
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:04,367
Aaaah!

43
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:07,826
What the are you doing?
Stupid-ass rock.

44
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:11,608
Aaah! Not gonna work.

45
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,110
I think I'm done, dude.

46
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:15,378
Copy that.

47
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:20,083
I got you. I got you. Okay.

48
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:23,120
I don't know what to do
because that's bigger.

49
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:26,411
Than any boulder
we've ever moved ever.

50
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:33,864
Not only are we way behind,

51
00:02:33,888 --> 00:02:37,067
We need to be hustling
to get things done.

52
00:02:37,091 --> 00:02:40,370
Figure out where
that gold is hiding.

53
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:41,705
Losers talk about their best.

54
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:42,873
Winners just do it.

55
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:44,196
Just do it.

56
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:50,046
Into the abyss.

57
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,016
This current's kicking my ass.

58
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,619
- We're doing something different.
- We've never done this before.

59
00:02:55,643 --> 00:02:58,622
So no mistakes.
Got a lot riding on this.

60
00:02:58,646 --> 00:03:01,146
Three, two, one!

61
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:07,097
What do you got?
What do you got?

62
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:08,999
That's gold.

63
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:10,534
We're about to have
a big payday.

64
00:03:10,558 --> 00:03:13,637
Holy crap!
That's the pocket! Whoo!

65
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:14,838
Everywhere.

66
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:17,474
I'll remember today
for the rest of my life.

67
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:20,443
<font color="#ffff00">Captions by vitac</font>...
<font color="#00ffff">www.Vitac.Com.</font>

68
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:23,502
Captions paid for by
discovery communications.

69
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:29,719
That's the thing
about this place...

70
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:31,388
Just when you think
you got your together.

71
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:32,989
And things are going good,

72
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:36,259
Mother nature kicks you
in the teeth.

73
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:40,263
In porcupine creek, Alaska...

74
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:45,702
Dustin's best-ever season
has hit a roadblock.

75
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:50,540
A gigantic boulder at the bottom
of rockfall ravine.

76
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,943
Is blocking his path
to what could be.

77
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:55,400
A life-changing pile of gold.

78
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,616
- Hey, mark.
- Dustin, how's it going?

79
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,651
It's going pretty good, man.

80
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:04,621
Good to see you.
I'm glad we found you.

81
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:07,190
Four miles from dustin's claim,

82
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:12,195
The mining legend known
as "the pirate," mark sebens,

83
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:17,133
Has been pulling gold out
of the ground for over 20 years.

84
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:19,536
How come you're not
in the water?

85
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,972
Well, we're having
a little bit of a problem.

86
00:04:21,996 --> 00:04:23,940
We got a rock sitting
at the bottom of a hole,

87
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:26,409
Sitting on bedrock,
and we can't move it.

88
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,477
That's a tough one.

89
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:29,913
It's more than my gear
is rated for.

90
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,681
So I don't think I can move it.

91
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:33,283
And we're not gonna try.

92
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:36,086
Because I'll break every last
thing I put on it, basically.

93
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,921
What about Carlos? He's tough.

94
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,511
I don't think he's that tough.

95
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:44,828
But what I do have... I've got
something called rock blasters.

96
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:46,997
Okay. Drill down into a boulder.

97
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:48,265
Or a large rock, you set...

98
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:49,733
These are small charges.

99
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:52,902
It sends a shock wave down and
will crack good-size boulders.

100
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:56,139
So if you want to try that,
I've got it here with me.

101
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:57,907
That sounds great, man.

102
00:04:57,931 --> 00:05:00,210
It's somewhere in here.

103
00:05:00,234 --> 00:05:02,646
I'm very well organized.

104
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,982
Not!

105
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:08,874
Let's see. Give me a sec.

106
00:05:13,347 --> 00:05:16,893
Wait. Here we go.

107
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:19,596
I thought it was gonna be
a huge kit.

108
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,231
Pretty compact
so you guys can get it.

109
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:22,599
Up to where you're working at.

110
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:23,867
That's pretty cool, man.

111
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:25,568
And if you set
several of them in a row,

112
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:27,904
You can split any size boulder
that you want.

113
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:29,906
Figured it'd be more than that,
but that'll work.

114
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,308
That should take care
of your problem.

115
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:32,275
Okay.

116
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:33,743
Got to get more food for Carlos.

117
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:35,145
Absolutely.

118
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,946
Well, hell, yeah, man. Thanks.

119
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,114
We'll get them back to you.

120
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:39,516
Take care.

121
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,084
If these things actually work,

122
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:44,087
This is gonna be
a huge game-changer for us.

123
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:45,789
There's not gonna
be a single rock.

124
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:47,657
We can't move or get under.

125
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,693
We got a lot riding on this.

126
00:05:49,717 --> 00:05:52,117
This doesn't work, I don't know
what we're gonna do.

127
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,775
Hey, Ryan, what the hell's wrong
with your leg?

128
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:07,777
My leg's hurting me pretty bad.

129
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:10,246
You got to be
in the water today.

130
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,415
Higher up the mountain,

131
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:15,585
With less than an ounce of gold
so far,

132
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:20,924
Fred hurt and his crew are
having their worst season yet.

133
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:22,525
Well, to tell you the truth,
Fred, man,

134
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,060
My hip is killing me, man.

135
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:26,796
It's only getting worse
walking down this height.

136
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,898
Well, let's go on
up to the tent.

137
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:31,156
We'll talk about it. Alright.

138
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:35,438
The corona pandemic cost them.

139
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:38,130
The first four weeks
of their season.

140
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:42,812
His right-hand man,
Paul Richardson,

141
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:47,851
Upped and left three weeks ago
and is yet to return.

142
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,119
He's coming.

143
00:06:49,143 --> 00:06:53,979
And the double dive duty
has taken its toll on Ryan.

144
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:58,928
What the hell?

145
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:00,663
It's been bothering me
for a couple of days.

146
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:04,534
But today, coming down the hill
there, it got really bad.

147
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:07,426
I got some really bad grinding
going on in there.

148
00:07:11,465 --> 00:07:16,312
Believe it or not, Dustin is
a therapeutic masseuse.

149
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:17,547
Yeah?

150
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:20,116
He makes you lay down
flat on your face.

151
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,118
And bend your leg backwards.

152
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:23,286
It hurts like

153
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,320
I bet.

154
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:25,588
Well, I'm willing
to try anything.

155
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:26,723
Yeah.

156
00:07:26,747 --> 00:07:28,324
You know, I know it's my turn
to dove today,

157
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:30,260
But I can't see
how I'm gonna put on.

158
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,551
A 50-pound weight belt
and move anywhere.

159
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,532
Wow.

160
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:37,066
If it continues like this,

161
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,424
My diving days
might be over out here.

162
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:47,977
Well, let's just go ahead
and get me in the water.

163
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:50,113
And we'll do it.

164
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:54,417
Fred's already dived twice
in the last five days,

165
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:57,587
But as Scott took
the most recent dive,

166
00:07:57,611 --> 00:08:01,191
The 77-year-old maverick...

167
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:04,861
Must step up once more
for him to have any chance.

168
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:09,532
To get down
to the gold on bedrock.

169
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:11,768
Into the abyss.

170
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:13,403
How's your visibility
down there?

171
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:15,472
Got about a foot,
foot and a half.

172
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:17,807
The water is ice...

173
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,843
Did you say the water's too hot?

174
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:22,067
- No.
- Okay.

175
00:08:24,438 --> 00:08:27,784
Fred is 14 feet deep,

176
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:31,476
Following the vertical face
of an ancient waterfall.

177
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:37,126
But Fred believes
they're only halfway down.

178
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,661
And every day must count.

179
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:43,054
If they are to get down
to the pile of gold on bedrock.

180
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,840
Alright, I got
two or three large rocks.

181
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:54,077
And I'm throwing...

182
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:56,412
Rocks out of the way
so I can put the sled down.

183
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:58,581
Might be possible to be able
to roll it right there.

184
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:00,450
Copy that.

185
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:02,919
Right here at all.

186
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:05,955
Rocks. Nothing but rocks.

187
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:07,312
Copy.

188
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:11,661
Alright.

189
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:15,131
Alright, y'all bring up
the basket.

190
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:17,700
Nice rock, boss. Nice rock.

191
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,492
Yeah, looking good.
Mineral rock there.

192
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:25,942
Fred's first basket of the day,
that was a damn good basket.

193
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:28,433
Nice big rocks.
Get those out of the way.

194
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,151
Getting ugly a little bit
on that water.

195
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:37,086
The water's horrible, man.

196
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,955
Water's definitely
coming up quick.

197
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:41,057
You know, hopefully Fred
can get through it okay.

198
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,960
It's gonna be rough, though.

199
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:46,095
Are you out of the way
of the basket?

200
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:48,987
Not yet, but just a minute.

201
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:53,191
Alright, I got to go sit down.

202
00:09:57,631 --> 00:10:01,644
I really hate seeing
Ryan suffer this way.

203
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:03,580
He's in a lot of pain.

204
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:06,616
With Paul being gone, it's
the never-ending saga this year.

205
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,619
Of stuff breaking
and people getting hurt.

206
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:11,020
Well, if Ryan has to take off.

207
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:12,555
For a couple of days
'cause of his back,

208
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:13,990
I don't know what the hell
we're gonna do.

209
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:15,992
I don't think we can dive.

210
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:19,228
That's got a big question mark
for our season.

211
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:21,798
With Paul being gone,
it's just inevitable.

212
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:23,833
That somebody's
gonna get injured.

213
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:29,138
You know, this site definitely
can't be run by two people,

214
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:31,641
Especially when
one of the guys is new.

215
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:33,843
And it would make it really,
really difficult.

216
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:35,478
For them
to run this place alone.

217
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:38,982
So we're all hoping Paul
gets back here quickly.

218
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:40,416
I just don't know
what's going on.

219
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,851
But I know, you know,
if I leave,

220
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,675
These guys are in some deep.

221
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:51,728
Alright, I think
I'm ready to come up.

222
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:54,364
Fred will use the gold blaster.

223
00:10:54,388 --> 00:10:57,900
To cut through the hard pack
he's uncovered.

224
00:10:57,924 --> 00:11:00,303
Fred's down there calling
for the gold blaster.

225
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:01,904
That means he's ready
to dig deeper.

226
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:04,841
So, hopefully,
we can fire this thing up.

227
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:06,009
And he can get
a couple of feet today.

228
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:08,166
Because we really need
to hit bedrock.

229
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:20,423
Power. I'm gonna crank her up.

230
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,913
Alright, here we go.

231
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:27,897
The gold blaster breaks up.

232
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:30,655
The compacted gravel fred's hit.

233
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:37,507
Opening up new real estate.

234
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:40,832
And potentially
gold-rich material.

235
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:51,220
- How's it going down there?
- Well.

236
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:54,557
Fred's a hell
of a trooper for 77.

237
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:59,696
Amazing, every day,
what I see him do.

238
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,932
Fred's making
a lot of progress today.

239
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:04,600
He's got some good rocks
out there.

240
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:06,836
He's got the gold blaster,

241
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,805
And now he's got a lot of
material to suck up down there.

242
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:11,930
So, fred's having
a damn good dive today.

243
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:18,069
The current's
pretty damn strong.

244
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,108
This water is really raging.

245
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:30,293
Elements in the chilkat
mountains can flip on a dime,

246
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:35,431
And the heavy rain now thunders
through the trifecta.

247
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,234
This current's kicking my ass.

248
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:41,604
After four hours in the water,

249
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:45,541
Fred calls it a day.

250
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:46,743
Coming up.

251
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:49,234
Copy that. Diver coming up.
Diver coming up.

252
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:02,458
He's got two feet
closer to bedrock.

253
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:05,962
I'm so tired right now
that I can hardly stand up.

254
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:10,655
But the broken crew
really needs to catch a break.

255
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:18,541
Another day
with no gold showing.

256
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:19,998
Did anybody look?

257
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:27,917
No gold.

258
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:32,755
Well, this area just doesn't
have gold in the over burden.

259
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:34,223
Yeah.

260
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:36,159
We'll get to the bottom
eventually,

261
00:13:36,183 --> 00:13:38,795
Figure out where that gold
is hiding.

262
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:40,663
We're on a marsh
down to the bottom.

263
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:42,899
And we're looking
for the real gold.

264
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:46,135
If we find that nice little "v"
full of gold down there.

265
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:50,295
In the bottom of this,
freddy's fortune.

266
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:58,414
Up ahead...

267
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,483
We know there's gold down here.

268
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,385
So this is my only option
right now.

269
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:03,452
You got it.

270
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:04,921
What do you got?
What do you got?

271
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:07,990
Look at that! That's gold.

272
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:13,384
3... 2... 1...

273
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,841
You want to have
Dustin try to look at it?

274
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:28,144
I don't know if I want
to stretch me all out right now.

275
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:32,882
Dustin is a licensed
therapeutic masseur,

276
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:37,920
So maybe he can help him out,
maybe he can't.

277
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:42,758
Ryan has completed the steep
hike back to Mckinley camp.

278
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:46,229
Despite debilitating pain.

279
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:48,231
What's going on, man?

280
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:50,132
Lost that option. Sorry.

281
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:52,101
What you did? I don't know, man.

282
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:56,072
I got a real, real bad pain
right in my hip joint.

283
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:59,508
On a mine site, this remote,

284
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:03,412
An injury can end
the miner's season.

285
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:04,680
Why don't you
let me help you out?

286
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:07,049
I don't know if I could stand
the pain, man.

287
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:08,551
It's a trade off... now with me.

288
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:11,387
Or all night
or maybe even all week.

289
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,989
I don't know. It's up to you.

290
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:13,656
Let's do it.

291
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,758
Yeah? Yeah.

292
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:19,962
If Ryan can't dive,
then fred's entire operation.

293
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:24,700
Will once again
come to a standstill.

294
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:26,858
We'll fix you up, man.
Don't worry about it.

295
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:33,943
Have a seat. Just lay down.

296
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:36,412
I'm going to press right here.

297
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,403
This hurts.

298
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:43,219
Well, you're out of the rain.

299
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:46,055
Best to leave the place
to just him and Ryan.

300
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,224
Up about two inches.

301
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:50,493
I know.

302
00:15:50,517 --> 00:15:51,527
I know.

303
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,696
I think it's a torture chamber.

304
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,987
Yeah, it is.

305
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,805
Hey, y'all doing
alright in there?

306
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:05,942
Yeah, let me work on him
for a minute, Fred.

307
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:07,899
Alright.

308
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:12,682
It's mid-July,

309
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:18,287
But this far north, signs
of winter are fast approaching.

310
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:21,958
I'm predicting August 31st,
first snow.

311
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:24,293
I put five bucks on it.
Anybody bet me?

312
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:27,797
I bet October 15th. Ho, ho, ho!

313
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:31,734
I'm going... October 20th.
I'm probably wrong.

314
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:33,202
You guys are so far off.

315
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:35,338
Should I put this down
on a calendar or something?

316
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:37,640
Walk around for just a second.

317
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:40,409
It feels about 80 times better.

318
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:41,677
- How you feel, bro?
- Hey, man.

319
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:45,147
- You look good.
- You want to race?

320
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,949
Look like you got tears
in your eyes, man.

321
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:48,617
Yeah, I cried just a little bit.

322
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:51,187
I know, dude.

323
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:52,621
You couldn't do that before.

324
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:53,756
No, not really.

325
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,559
- Thanks, Dustin.
- Yeah, thanks a lot, man.

326
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:57,860
I appreciate it.

327
00:16:57,884 --> 00:17:00,262
Miracle worker here.

328
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:03,199
The last thing you need
is a diver out of the rotation.

329
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:04,900
You need all hands on deck.

330
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:07,125
- Doctor Dustin.
- Doctor hurt.

331
00:17:09,963 --> 00:17:11,707
Take it easy. Get some rest.

332
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:14,510
Ryan must stay on light duty.

333
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:17,580
To avoid further injury,

334
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:21,017
Meaning he cannot dive
for a week.

335
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,886
It was super, super painful,
but I'm just thankful.

336
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:27,523
That he is around and, you know,
was willing to do that for me.

337
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,325
Kind of need you.

338
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:31,660
Yeah, and I want to be there.
I don't want to be away.

339
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:34,263
Damn right. We got gold to get.

340
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:37,033
I'm down to two helpers.

341
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:38,534
We need everybody
in the world out here.

342
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,936
I mean, we got so much
to do right now.

343
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,205
We're not only way behind,

344
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,997
We need to be hustling
to get things done.

345
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:54,750
In all the years that we worked
out here, never had to move.

346
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:56,352
A boulder this big.

347
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:59,221
Dustin's crew
is mining the most gold-rich.

348
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:02,725
Dive site of their lives.

349
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:08,130
But the gold trail is now
blocked by a gargantuan boulder.

350
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:10,566
It is a big, big boulder,

351
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:14,804
So we're going to take it slow
and no mistakes.

352
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:16,739
You're not in a hurry, alright?

353
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,908
You're doing
something different.

354
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:23,412
We've never done this before,
so no mistakes.

355
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:26,482
Everybody take the damn time
and focus on what they're doing.

356
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:27,950
Try my best.

357
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:31,020
Losers talk about their best.
Winners just do it.

358
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:33,255
Just do it. Just do it.

359
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:38,494
We don't have enough winch power
or cable power or skyline.

360
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:40,062
To pull this boulder around.

361
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:42,198
We're having to bring
in new techniques.

362
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:44,467
We're having to
step up our game.

363
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:45,634
The whole reason we're here.

364
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:47,236
Is because
we know there's gold down there.

365
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,572
We can't just leave it there,
and we can't move the rock.

366
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:52,374
So, this is my only option
right now.

367
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:55,578
Hopefully, we can blow it
to little pieces.

368
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:57,913
To crack open the boulder,

369
00:18:57,937 --> 00:19:02,751
They will first need to drill
holes for the blaster rods.

370
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:05,621
So, this is a cordless
underwater drill.

371
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:06,956
Do you know how they work?

372
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,825
"Pressurize tool
before all underwater work.

373
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:14,063
"See instructions." which,
we don't have instructions.

374
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:17,600
They need to set the pressure
inside the hammer drill.

375
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:20,202
To match the water pressure
at the depth.

376
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:23,272
James will be working.

377
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:25,407
Too little pressure,

378
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:29,145
And water will penetrate
and kill the motor.

379
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:33,415
Too much pressure,
and the drill will seize up.

380
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:36,318
So you pump it up
with a bike pump.

381
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,721
See, this is "bar"?
That's the red numbers.

382
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:41,457
- Okay, the red number.
- That's 6. That's 90 pounds.

383
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:44,527
- So, six more.
- I guess.

384
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:47,730
I really,
really don't know, man.

385
00:19:47,754 --> 00:19:50,688
Let's go get him in the water,
shall we? Alright.

386
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:57,273
James is the least
experienced member of the crew.

387
00:19:57,297 --> 00:20:01,577
But his brute strength is
the reason Dustin selects him.

388
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:03,846
For this critical mission.

389
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,581
Could be a good day, man.

390
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:06,949
Yeah, I believe so.

391
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:08,517
So, you just stay calm.

392
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,320
I want you to do everything
right today.

393
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:13,722
Can't have any mistakes.

394
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:17,582
Alright. Maybe you're ready?
We're ready.

395
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:23,399
You hit bottom? Yeah.

396
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:26,969
Yeah.
I'm looking at the boulder.

397
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:31,173
Copy that. We'll get
the underwater cordless drill.

398
00:20:31,197 --> 00:20:35,110
Here we go.

399
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:37,702
Alright.
Just give me some gas, man.

400
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,051
Be gentle on it, man.

401
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:44,420
I don't know what the seals
are gonna do down there.

402
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:46,655
Alright.

403
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:49,725
Let's see if we can drill.

404
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,027
Right now, we got a brand-new
underwater drill.

405
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:57,299
That we're testing,
never tested before.

406
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:58,634
It's going slow!

407
00:20:58,658 --> 00:21:01,604
You've got to really pull
the trigger.

408
00:21:01,628 --> 00:21:02,538
Is it working at all?

409
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:03,906
Yeah, it is. Okay.

410
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,175
It's just really hard
to pull the trigger.

411
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:09,278
Yeah, well, then you're man
for the job down there.

412
00:21:09,302 --> 00:21:15,084
Boy... I can't even get it
to sit right.

413
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:18,754
I don't know what to tell you.

414
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,155
Got it! Got it! I got it.

415
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:21,390
It's going. It's going.

416
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:24,560
Boy, that trigger is tough.

417
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:26,083
Yeah, well, be tougher.

418
00:21:32,425 --> 00:21:33,802
Are you on hole two yet?

419
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:36,839
Hole two. Awesome.

420
00:21:36,863 --> 00:21:41,644
James needs to drill three holes
for the full set of blasters.

421
00:21:41,668 --> 00:21:44,246
You don't have to go
balls deep with that one.

422
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,415
Just go three quarters,
then go to the next one.

423
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:47,738
And see what you can get.

424
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,923
It's shutting off.

425
00:21:54,947 --> 00:21:58,149
Alright, bring it back up.
And see. I don't know.

426
00:22:11,898 --> 00:22:14,510
It's so weird.

427
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:19,248
I think it's cooked.

428
00:22:19,272 --> 00:22:25,187
Without the drill, they
won't be able to blast the rock.

429
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:27,423
There's a failed attempt.

430
00:22:27,447 --> 00:22:30,314
What do we do now?

431
00:22:44,664 --> 00:22:46,909
That's so weird.

432
00:22:46,933 --> 00:22:49,345
I think it's cooked. Really?

433
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:54,516
At rock fall ravine,
dustin's attempting to blow up.

434
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,786
The biggest rock
they've ever found.

435
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,189
What do we do now?

436
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:05,227
They need to drill a third hole
for the blast charges.

437
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:07,363
Worst-case scenario, there was
water inside the machine.

438
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:08,464
And it's dead now.

439
00:23:08,488 --> 00:23:13,457
But their underwater drill
has failed.

440
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:19,408
What the is wrong with that?

441
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:21,043
Has it got too much pressure
or something?

442
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:22,878
Maybe.

443
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:25,314
Carlos, check
the pressure, please.

444
00:23:25,338 --> 00:23:26,648
See, if you put
too much pressure on it,

445
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:28,817
It can't handle it.

446
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:34,723
They've pressurized the drill
to 90 psi,

447
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:38,861
4 times what it should be
for a 10-foot dive.

448
00:23:38,885 --> 00:23:42,264
The increased pressure
on the seal causes friction,

449
00:23:42,288 --> 00:23:45,100
And with it, heat.

450
00:23:45,124 --> 00:23:49,638
When the motor overheats,
it cuts out.

451
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:52,841
Stand by. Stand by.

452
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:58,147
Pressure released,
Carlos can now re pressurize.

453
00:23:58,171 --> 00:24:01,216
The drill correctly...

454
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:05,287
We've got 30 pounds of pressure
with 35 pounds.

455
00:24:05,311 --> 00:24:06,944
It's holding the pressure, man.

456
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:12,983
And James can get back
to drilling the charge holes.

457
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:18,600
Hole number 3.

458
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:21,437
You got it.

459
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:26,074
Appreciate it.

460
00:24:26,098 --> 00:24:30,345
That's good, dude.
I think it's good enough.

461
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:32,214
So I've got the charge,

462
00:24:32,238 --> 00:24:34,750
The boosters
onto the power head,

463
00:24:34,774 --> 00:24:37,853
So I've got connectors here,
and this is the blast cord.

464
00:24:37,877 --> 00:24:39,221
They say
they'll blow up underwater,

465
00:24:39,245 --> 00:24:41,924
But we've never done it.
I have no idea.

466
00:24:41,948 --> 00:24:44,626
This is a whole
new system for us.

467
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,995
The blaster's must be
an exact fit.

468
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:50,699
Inside the drill holes.

469
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:54,403
Wes will fire a trigger
and send an electrical current.

470
00:24:54,427 --> 00:24:57,172
Down the blast cord.

471
00:24:57,196 --> 00:24:59,308
Onto the power heads,

472
00:24:59,332 --> 00:25:03,212
Detonating the blaster.

473
00:25:03,236 --> 00:25:08,383
The blast needs to be sealed
inside the boulder.

474
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:11,220
There's a small charge
to crack the monster rock.

475
00:25:11,244 --> 00:25:14,356
From the inside out.

476
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,091
We don't know
if it's going to work.

477
00:25:16,115 --> 00:25:17,693
Underneath the water or not,

478
00:25:17,717 --> 00:25:19,361
But it's really our only option
to get rid of.

479
00:25:19,385 --> 00:25:20,929
This large boulder.

480
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:26,201
That's got no telling
how much gold underneath it.

481
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:28,770
I'm giving you
these power heads.

482
00:25:28,794 --> 00:25:30,706
Be very, very careful.

483
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:33,242
I need you to plant these
in the rock.

484
00:25:33,266 --> 00:25:35,099
And then get the hell
out of there.

485
00:25:35,835 --> 00:25:38,747
Alright, slow down.

486
00:25:38,771 --> 00:25:41,483
All your movement
has to be slow right now.

487
00:25:41,507 --> 00:25:46,176
Okay? Everything
needs to slow down.

488
00:25:53,586 --> 00:25:55,319
Slow and steady, man.

489
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:16,307
It's gonna make
things easier. So far so good.

490
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:26,361
Whoa!

491
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:28,797
Are they in there?

492
00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:30,365
Yeah.

493
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:33,324
That's what I wanted to hear.

494
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:44,580
They're sticking out about
roughly 6 inches, 7 inches.

495
00:26:44,604 --> 00:26:46,281
That's almost perfect.

496
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:48,739
Last one's the toughest one.

497
00:26:55,748 --> 00:26:58,148
Catch your breath
and do it right.

498
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:15,844
Done now.

499
00:27:15,868 --> 00:27:17,779
Are they in there? Yeah.

500
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:21,149
Alright, there's
three blasters there.

501
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:24,286
Good job, man.

502
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:27,255
That was a tough one.
Yeah, right, man.

503
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,891
Y'all ready? We ready for this?

504
00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:31,915
We're ready!

505
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:40,802
I'm armed. Here we go!

506
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:42,871
3

507
00:27:42,895 --> 00:27:44,573
2

508
00:27:44,597 --> 00:27:47,931
1...

509
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:55,739
That hit a lot harder
than I thought it would.

510
00:27:58,644 --> 00:28:02,891
I'm so excited to find out
if it worked!

511
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:06,828
Wow!

512
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:09,520
It cracked!

513
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:16,104
I love it when a plan
comes together.

514
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:20,842
That was so much fun.
Good job, James.

515
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:23,211
This thing's completely cracked.

516
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:28,250
It just cracked it perfectly?

517
00:28:28,274 --> 00:28:32,220
Hell, yeah.

518
00:28:32,244 --> 00:28:38,260
We got a cool new toy
is what we got.

519
00:28:38,284 --> 00:28:40,796
This changes everything, dude.

520
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,164
We don't have to break
no more anchors,

521
00:28:42,188 --> 00:28:44,266
No more breaking guide lines.

522
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:45,967
Dude, there's
nothing that can stop us.

523
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:48,392
I mean nothing.

524
00:28:56,736 --> 00:28:59,214
Holy crap!

525
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:02,050
The boulder split.

526
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:06,788
The crew works to remove
the smaller chunk.

527
00:29:06,812 --> 00:29:10,092
That right there is about
a third of the rock.

528
00:29:10,116 --> 00:29:14,096
That's sitting down there,
and it's huge.

529
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,897
It's a big rock.

530
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:18,088
That's less than
a third right there.

531
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:25,373
Do the dredge where it was.

532
00:29:25,397 --> 00:29:28,510
The gravel beneath
the boulder should be.

533
00:29:28,534 --> 00:29:30,768
Prime nugget territory.

534
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:38,286
There we go.

535
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:43,725
This water is way too
freezing cold.

536
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:45,427
I got to stop.

537
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:47,028
That's alright, man.
That's cool, man.

538
00:29:47,052 --> 00:29:50,298
It's late.
It's been a long day, man.

539
00:29:50,322 --> 00:29:53,168
Yeah, I'm good. I'm tired, man.

540
00:29:53,192 --> 00:29:55,470
Did a lot of good work.

541
00:29:55,494 --> 00:29:59,541
After five hours in the water,
battling with a new drill.

542
00:29:59,565 --> 00:30:03,145
And new blasters,
James and the crew.

543
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:05,847
Check out the sluice.

544
00:30:05,871 --> 00:30:09,184
Holy holy moly!

545
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:11,987
- Is there nuggets in there?
- Look at at all that gold!

546
00:30:12,011 --> 00:30:14,756
My.

547
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:18,426
- Look at that!
- Holy.

548
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:21,062
There's ounces, dude!

549
00:30:21,086 --> 00:30:23,098
I just started it!

550
00:30:23,122 --> 00:30:26,802
Holy damn, man.

551
00:30:26,826 --> 00:30:29,905
I only dredged this much
of an area.

552
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:32,774
That's amazing.
I did not expect that.

553
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:36,611
That's only a third
of that rock.

554
00:30:36,635 --> 00:30:39,548
Gold. Gold. Gold. Gold.

555
00:30:39,572 --> 00:30:41,383
That is ama...

556
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:44,719
It was a great day.
We got to use a new toy,

557
00:30:44,743 --> 00:30:47,556
And we got gold.
This is why we're here.

558
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:50,659
It was the epitome
of why we should be here.

559
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:53,662
This is what we've been talking
about... pockets of gold.

560
00:30:53,686 --> 00:30:56,498
And it was right
underneath that boulder.

561
00:30:56,522 --> 00:30:58,967
And you see how much more
is in here, right?

562
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:00,068
I see it, man.

563
00:31:00,092 --> 00:31:03,138
About five ounces
of gold in here.

564
00:31:03,162 --> 00:31:05,207
We broke this big piece
of rock out,

565
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:08,176
But it's only less than a third.
We got a lot more work to do.

566
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,946
But I love this job.
This is an adventure,

567
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:13,971
And we're having
a damn good time doing it.

568
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:29,698
It was a long,
rough night last night,

569
00:31:29,722 --> 00:31:32,868
I woke up this morning,
and my left leg was numb.

570
00:31:32,892 --> 00:31:34,870
Wow. That's not good.

571
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:38,206
At their porcupine base camp,

572
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:42,410
Ryan's injury
has worsened overnight.

573
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:43,578
I don't know
what to say about it.

574
00:31:43,602 --> 00:31:45,669
I'm kind of in
a rough spot here.

575
00:31:48,307 --> 00:31:49,751
Sounds like somebody's
pulling in.

576
00:31:49,775 --> 00:31:52,120
Yeah, it does.

577
00:31:52,144 --> 00:31:54,756
I think that's Paul.

578
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:57,492
What's going on, man?
Not too much.

579
00:31:57,516 --> 00:31:58,827
Where you been?

580
00:31:58,851 --> 00:32:01,429
I had to go take care
of some personal business.

581
00:32:01,453 --> 00:32:06,434
And get that done
and get back as soon as I could.

582
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:08,069
Sorry I had to leave you guys,
but I had some stuff.

583
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:09,604
That needed to take care of.

584
00:32:09,628 --> 00:32:10,939
Alright.

585
00:32:10,963 --> 00:32:14,276
So, how's everything been going?

586
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,645
Actually, it's been
pretty damn rough.

587
00:32:16,669 --> 00:32:18,880
Ryan and I've been doing
double duty.

588
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:20,582
On the diving and everything.

589
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:22,017
They have a little bit
of problem.

590
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:23,385
With his hip or something.

591
00:32:23,409 --> 00:32:27,088
I said, "crap.
What am I going to do now?"

592
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:29,157
We're making
pretty good progress.

593
00:32:29,181 --> 00:32:32,861
I think Ryan and I are kind of
wearing down a little bit.

594
00:32:32,885 --> 00:32:35,463
So, y'all get any gold at all?

595
00:32:35,487 --> 00:32:39,834
Just a little.
We could use some help out here.

596
00:32:39,858 --> 00:32:42,971
Said I'm all rested up,
so I'm ready to go.

597
00:32:42,995 --> 00:32:44,739
Let's go ahead
and get out there.

598
00:32:44,763 --> 00:32:45,840
Put me in. Alright.

599
00:32:45,864 --> 00:32:47,764
Alright. Let's do it.

600
00:32:52,237 --> 00:32:57,419
Paul's return means the crew
can now get back to diving.

601
00:32:57,443 --> 00:33:02,724
He first mined with
"Dakota" Fred in the glory hole.

602
00:33:02,748 --> 00:33:06,261
Seven years ago.

603
00:33:06,285 --> 00:33:11,232
Over time, he's become
his most trusted crew member.

604
00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:12,667
We did things a little
bit different.

605
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:14,469
Than when you was here last.

606
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,604
It's looking pretty good.
Y'all moved a lot of rocks.

607
00:33:16,628 --> 00:33:18,306
That's a lot of rock
out of there.

608
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:21,009
We got a pretty nice sized hole
over there.

609
00:33:21,033 --> 00:33:22,978
It's about 10 feet deep or so.

610
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:25,780
Not bad. So, about another 10
feet, and we'll hit the bottom.

611
00:33:25,804 --> 00:33:28,149
We hope is before that.

612
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:30,752
Well, we'll give you
a baptism of fire,

613
00:33:30,776 --> 00:33:32,520
And you're going to go in today.

614
00:33:32,544 --> 00:33:33,955
Perfect.

615
00:33:33,979 --> 00:33:35,857
Straight off the airplane
and straight into the water.

616
00:33:35,881 --> 00:33:37,292
Damn right. Heck, yeah.

617
00:33:37,316 --> 00:33:40,061
Let's go.

618
00:33:40,085 --> 00:33:43,298
Sometimes when you've been away
and kind of hoping.

619
00:33:43,322 --> 00:33:45,300
To kind of ease
back into the thing.

620
00:33:45,324 --> 00:33:47,035
Nah, just throw him
right in water,

621
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:52,062
Get him orientated right now...
Baptism of fire.

622
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,012
Well, Paul, you know
we're way behind, buddy.

623
00:33:57,036 --> 00:33:59,047
We need some gold
in that box today.

624
00:33:59,071 --> 00:34:00,081
I know.

625
00:34:00,105 --> 00:34:01,549
Good luck. Have a good time.

626
00:34:01,573 --> 00:34:05,220
Alright. Good luck, Paul.

627
00:34:05,244 --> 00:34:07,589
A big weight lifted
off our shoulders.

628
00:34:07,613 --> 00:34:09,758
Now that paul's back
down in the water.

629
00:34:09,782 --> 00:34:12,727
We're going to have
an increase in material moved,

630
00:34:12,751 --> 00:34:15,063
And that's exactly what we need
to get down at the bottom.

631
00:34:15,087 --> 00:34:16,264
Alright, here we go.

632
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:17,888
Have a good time.

633
00:34:24,063 --> 00:34:26,141
How's your visibility
down there, Paul?

634
00:34:26,165 --> 00:34:29,277
About 3, 4 feet at least.

635
00:34:29,301 --> 00:34:32,347
Hell, yeah.

636
00:34:32,371 --> 00:34:35,817
Two months
into the shortened season,

637
00:34:35,841 --> 00:34:39,109
This is paul's first dive.

638
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:46,327
Alright, go ahead. Yep.

639
00:34:46,351 --> 00:34:50,921
First, Paul cleans up
the exposed bedrock sidewall.

640
00:34:59,031 --> 00:35:00,475
How's it going down there?

641
00:35:00,499 --> 00:35:02,343
I'm about ready
for the gold blaster.

642
00:35:02,367 --> 00:35:04,201
Copy that.

643
00:35:08,207 --> 00:35:10,907
Let me get some water
going through that thing.

644
00:35:16,748 --> 00:35:18,393
This thing's fun.

645
00:35:18,417 --> 00:35:21,985
It definitely is.

646
00:35:25,691 --> 00:35:27,411
Muddies up the water
down there, doesn't it?

647
00:35:30,095 --> 00:35:34,442
He uses the gold blaster
to punch through the hard pack.

648
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:37,200
And push closer
to the bedrock below.

649
00:35:39,438 --> 00:35:44,953
I bust right through
that hard pack.

650
00:35:44,977 --> 00:35:50,558
Maybe we're getting on to
something a little different.

651
00:35:50,582 --> 00:35:52,460
When the material changes,
the layers change,

652
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:53,661
That's always exciting,

653
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:55,652
Because you never know
what's in the new stuff.

654
00:36:04,696 --> 00:36:08,231
What? Go back.

655
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:14,415
What do you got?
What do you got?

656
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:18,019
Look at that!

657
00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:21,356
Alright. That's gold.
That's the real thing, man.

658
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:25,093
- Yeah, dude!
- Great job, Paul.

659
00:36:25,117 --> 00:36:31,666
After weeks of no
gold, five hours in the water,

660
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:37,104
Paul has delivered their first
golden nugget of the season.

661
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:39,040
It'll be good for the morale
of the crew.

662
00:36:39,064 --> 00:36:41,643
It'll be good for<i> my</i> morale.

663
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:43,912
That's pretty
damn exciting news,

664
00:36:43,936 --> 00:36:46,181
Knowing that we're actually
finding gold again now.

665
00:36:46,205 --> 00:36:49,984
I think that's officially
called paul's crack now.

666
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:53,121
It's great to have Paul back,
and he absolutely kicked butt.

667
00:36:53,145 --> 00:36:55,356
We don't need a superhero
out here in Paul.

668
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,325
We just need him
to come back out here.

669
00:36:57,349 --> 00:36:58,960
And do what he normally does.

670
00:36:58,984 --> 00:37:01,696
And that's what we're all
out here for, finding that gold.

671
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,364
And today, we found it.

672
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:08,369
Alright, man, look at that.
That's gold right there.

673
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:11,172
We got some pickers
in here, Fred.

674
00:37:11,196 --> 00:37:13,474
That one right there is
the one that I saw.

675
00:37:13,498 --> 00:37:14,576
Down there in that crack.

676
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,677
That was in your crack?

677
00:37:15,701 --> 00:37:17,679
That was in my crack.
Alright, man.

678
00:37:17,703 --> 00:37:19,547
Look at that one right there.

679
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,382
- Wow.
- Look at that, man.

680
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:23,985
That is a sexy piece
of gold right there.

681
00:37:24,009 --> 00:37:27,121
- Alright, good job, Paul.
- Good job, man.

682
00:37:27,145 --> 00:37:28,656
That was my first dive.

683
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:32,227
Couldn't ask for a better day...
Good, clear water, full team,

684
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:35,430
Everybody working hard,
and it paid off.

685
00:37:35,454 --> 00:37:38,199
There's nothing better than
seeing gold come out of the box.

686
00:37:38,223 --> 00:37:40,868
The crew, now at full strength,

687
00:37:40,892 --> 00:37:45,173
They are on the gold
and back on track.

688
00:37:45,197 --> 00:37:49,644
It's been a long, long, long,
long summer of no gold.

689
00:37:49,668 --> 00:37:52,380
If we can continue
on this trajectory,

690
00:37:52,404 --> 00:37:54,549
We're going to get
to that bedrock this season.

691
00:37:54,573 --> 00:37:59,053
And not only that, we're about
to have a big pay day.

692
00:37:59,077 --> 00:38:02,357
I'm happy to see
it finally showed up.

693
00:38:02,381 --> 00:38:03,858
I can't wait
to get down there tomorrow.

694
00:38:03,882 --> 00:38:05,326
And get down a little deeper.

695
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:06,628
Alright, guys.

696
00:38:06,652 --> 00:38:09,731
Either freddy's folly
or freddy's fortune.

697
00:38:09,755 --> 00:38:12,567
Until we get down to the bottom,
we won't know.

698
00:38:12,591 --> 00:38:16,493
It's going to be good!

699
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:22,644
Up ahead...

700
00:38:22,668 --> 00:38:24,779
You guys ready to pop
some rock?!

701
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:26,970
We're going to pop
the rest of the hippo.

702
00:38:29,141 --> 00:38:33,087
Holy -my.

703
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:38,114
Are you alright?

704
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:52,073
In the wilderness,

705
00:38:52,097 --> 00:38:54,042
Months of living
shoulder-to-shoulder.

706
00:38:54,066 --> 00:38:57,233
With your crew can get to you.

707
00:38:59,304 --> 00:39:02,650
Damn it. You spit
all over my man.

708
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:05,687
See what I got to deal with?

709
00:39:05,711 --> 00:39:07,388
I pee on that at night, dude.

710
00:39:07,412 --> 00:39:09,557
You do what?!

711
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:10,958
It's just a fixture, you know?

712
00:39:10,982 --> 00:39:13,461
It's just kind of like
garden gnomes, man.

713
00:39:13,485 --> 00:39:15,185
I piss on those things
all the time.

714
00:39:18,156 --> 00:39:23,259
You're funny man.

715
00:39:35,407 --> 00:39:38,386
You guys ready to pop
some rock?!

716
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:41,689
At rockfall ravine,
dustin's determined.

717
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:44,292
To get the crew
back on the gold.

718
00:39:44,316 --> 00:39:47,462
Whoo!

719
00:39:47,486 --> 00:39:51,599
But, first, he has to break up
the rest of the hippo boulder.

720
00:39:51,623 --> 00:39:55,103
That they couldn't remove
on their last dive.

721
00:39:55,127 --> 00:39:57,360
Alright, good to go? Good to go.

722
00:40:00,799 --> 00:40:03,077
My head is freezing.

723
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:08,082
Wow. There's pieces
of rock everywhere.

724
00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:11,085
Yeah, man, that rock blaster,
man, deal.

725
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:12,553
It's like rock and roll.

726
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:15,523
Alright, I think I'm only going
to put two in the center.

727
00:40:15,547 --> 00:40:17,058
Of this thing
and see if it cracks.

728
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:19,861
Good deal, man.
We got the drill ready.

729
00:40:19,885 --> 00:40:21,396
Alright, gonna put two holes,
no problem.

730
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,964
I'm coming up for the drill.

731
00:40:22,988 --> 00:40:25,121
He's coming up for the drill.

732
00:40:31,296 --> 00:40:33,341
Let's see what happens, man.

733
00:40:33,365 --> 00:40:37,211
Alright.

734
00:40:37,235 --> 00:40:39,380
Gonna do a little bit
of pumpkin carving.

735
00:40:39,404 --> 00:40:45,119
On this leftover hippo rock.

736
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:48,289
We just need two holes, man.

737
00:40:48,313 --> 00:40:53,694
That's all we need, two holes.

738
00:40:53,718 --> 00:40:56,564
Alright, that's one hole.

739
00:40:56,588 --> 00:40:59,033
They figured out
the correct pressure,

740
00:40:59,057 --> 00:41:02,837
And the underwater drill's
working perfectly.

741
00:41:02,861 --> 00:41:04,338
I think that dustin's
going to use.

742
00:41:04,362 --> 00:41:06,908
Only two blasters on this one.

743
00:41:06,932 --> 00:41:09,143
You know what? I might be able
to get three in this thing.

744
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:11,734
Now he's talking about three.

745
00:41:15,407 --> 00:41:18,653
No doubt there's going
to be freaking gold underneath.

746
00:41:18,677 --> 00:41:20,354
No doubt!

747
00:41:20,378 --> 00:41:22,523
This is our pay day right here.

748
00:41:22,547 --> 00:41:25,626
This is where we collect
the fricking gold pot.

749
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:28,029
Alright.

750
00:41:28,053 --> 00:41:29,730
That's two.

751
00:41:29,754 --> 00:41:31,421
I finished one hole.

752
00:41:35,227 --> 00:41:38,940
Alright, I think
I drilled enough.

753
00:41:38,964 --> 00:41:42,677
Cross my fingers
and hope it works.

754
00:41:42,701 --> 00:41:45,580
Alright, wes gots
all your boulder blasters.

755
00:41:45,604 --> 00:41:46,881
Ready for you, man.

756
00:41:46,905 --> 00:41:48,538
Whenever you're ready.

757
00:41:52,377 --> 00:41:56,290
I can't lift my arm that high.

758
00:41:56,314 --> 00:42:01,162
I'm so god dang excited man.
I love it.

759
00:42:01,186 --> 00:42:03,798
Dustin
carefully places the charges.

760
00:42:03,822 --> 00:42:06,656
In the remaining section
of the hippo rock.

761
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,138
Dustin's got
the three holes drilled,

762
00:42:11,162 --> 00:42:12,807
Got our three charges in.

763
00:42:12,831 --> 00:42:14,108
We're ready to pop
this thing off.

764
00:42:14,132 --> 00:42:15,743
We're going to get
everybody out of the water.

765
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:20,147
We're going to pop
the rest of the hippo.

766
00:42:20,171 --> 00:42:22,416
Yeah, all three are plugged in.

767
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,785
I didn't get them exactly
perfectly up-and-down,

768
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:26,754
So hopefully they won't shoot
out and kill us all.

769
00:42:26,778 --> 00:42:28,890
Nah, it's not gonna shoot out.

770
00:42:28,914 --> 00:42:31,626
What a good way
to freaking get hurt, though.

771
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:34,529
Y'all good there?
Alright, let's do this.

772
00:42:34,553 --> 00:42:38,733
Ready?!

773
00:42:38,757 --> 00:42:40,134
I'm armed.

774
00:42:40,158 --> 00:42:45,940
Ready?! Ready!

775
00:42:45,964 --> 00:42:47,642
3

776
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:48,943
2

777
00:42:48,967 --> 00:42:50,433
1...

778
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:03,124
Nothing but gold down below.
I guarantee it, man.

779
00:43:03,148 --> 00:43:06,026
Wes, good job, brother.

780
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:09,931
The last of the hippo cracked,

781
00:43:09,955 --> 00:43:13,768
Dustin dives to see
what it has uncovered.

782
00:43:13,792 --> 00:43:16,270
Alright.

783
00:43:16,294 --> 00:43:20,863
It's nasty.
It's in three pieces now.

784
00:43:23,168 --> 00:43:28,871
Alright, got a bunch
of broken-ass rock down here.

785
00:43:37,082 --> 00:43:39,026
Going up.

786
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:43,631
Okay. He's freaking turned up.

787
00:43:43,655 --> 00:43:47,068
He's showing off.

788
00:43:47,092 --> 00:43:52,028
That's pretty cool, man.
That's funny.

789
00:44:00,171 --> 00:44:03,017
Get the out of here.

790
00:44:03,041 --> 00:44:05,386
Nuggets. Nuggets!

791
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:07,922
You got a nugget already?

792
00:44:07,946 --> 00:44:10,024
Yeah, I found one. Hell, yeah.

793
00:44:10,048 --> 00:44:11,726
There it is, gentlemen.

794
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:14,295
We got to get
underneath the rocks.

795
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:17,765
Yeah!

796
00:44:17,789 --> 00:44:18,966
Dustin popped up a nugget out.

797
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:21,135
From underneath the rock
he just broke.

798
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:24,961
My.

799
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:31,712
Are you alright?

800
00:44:31,736 --> 00:44:34,348
Did he lose his mind?

801
00:44:34,372 --> 00:44:36,606
Are you gonna
bring it up or what?

802
00:44:38,877 --> 00:44:40,721
Holy crap!

803
00:44:40,745 --> 00:44:42,857
Holy man!

804
00:44:42,881 --> 00:44:45,593
We knew it was going to be
down there underneath that rock.

805
00:44:45,617 --> 00:44:47,428
It's paid off.

806
00:44:47,452 --> 00:44:51,198
My gosh! Look at that, wes!

807
00:44:51,222 --> 00:44:53,334
Where there's going to be
so much gold down there, dude.

808
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:54,735
That's the pocket!

809
00:44:54,759 --> 00:44:56,837
That's the pocket that you was
talking about!

810
00:44:56,861 --> 00:45:00,041
After four seasons
trying and struggling,

811
00:45:00,065 --> 00:45:03,744
Their new underwater
blast system

812
00:45:03,768 --> 00:45:07,148
I just watched a whole pocketful
go up the dredge.

813
00:45:07,172 --> 00:45:09,316
Has allowed Dustin and his crew.

814
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:11,285
To get to the piles of gold.

815
00:45:11,309 --> 00:45:15,723
The old-timers
could never reach.

816
00:45:15,747 --> 00:45:17,525
We hit the jackpot.

817
00:45:17,549 --> 00:45:19,527
Alright, should I come up
or what?

818
00:45:19,551 --> 00:45:21,729
Yeah, I think we should
leave for Carlos.

819
00:45:21,753 --> 00:45:24,087
Yeah, man! Save some for me!

820
00:45:32,497 --> 00:45:34,942
Can you believe that?!

821
00:45:34,966 --> 00:45:38,379
Great freaking dive, dude.

822
00:45:38,403 --> 00:45:40,815
There will be a lot of gold
in that box.

823
00:45:40,839 --> 00:45:43,217
I guarantee there's
a bunch of gold in there.

824
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:44,985
I guarantee you, man.

825
00:45:45,009 --> 00:45:49,078
Last hour,
all I could see was gold.

826
00:45:52,951 --> 00:45:57,164
There's ounces in here,
ounces of gold.

827
00:45:57,188 --> 00:45:59,734
- So much gold!
- Like, big pieces.

828
00:45:59,758 --> 00:46:01,102
It's honestly the most gold

829
00:46:01,126 --> 00:46:02,970
I've ever seen in our sluice
since we've been dredging.

830
00:46:02,994 --> 00:46:05,072
Holy!

831
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:07,508
How awesome is that?

832
00:46:07,532 --> 00:46:09,877
I just was in awe.

833
00:46:09,901 --> 00:46:12,113
I couldn't believe
it just kept coming.

834
00:46:12,137 --> 00:46:13,581
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

835
00:46:13,605 --> 00:46:17,151
- It's literally everywhere.
- Yeah, it's just everywhere.

836
00:46:17,175 --> 00:46:20,354
The new tools are
a game changer.

837
00:46:20,378 --> 00:46:23,257
No boulder, no matter how big,

838
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:28,462
Can stop them
on their path to gold.

839
00:46:28,486 --> 00:46:32,166
I've got lots and lots of years.

840
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:35,169
Under this water right now,

841
00:46:35,193 --> 00:46:41,442
And today, possibly,
was<i> the</i> very best time.

842
00:46:41,466 --> 00:46:44,612
For over an hour,
it was gold constantly.

843
00:46:44,636 --> 00:46:48,282
It was like Christmas forever is
what it felt like.

844
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:51,018
Time slowed down.

845
00:46:51,042 --> 00:46:52,887
I enjoyed every second of it.

846
00:46:52,911 --> 00:46:55,523
I finally did this.

847
00:46:55,547 --> 00:46:57,291
I'm doing this right.

848
00:46:57,315 --> 00:47:03,898
Today was the most fun
I've ever had in the water ever.

849
00:47:03,922 --> 00:47:05,299
It didn't feel like
a dive anymore.

850
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:08,869
It felt like an experience.

851
00:47:08,893 --> 00:47:11,038
I laughed like a maniac,

852
00:47:11,062 --> 00:47:13,440
And I'm gonna ride this out
because I love it.

853
00:47:13,464 --> 00:47:14,642
I don't know how long
it will last,

854
00:47:14,666 --> 00:47:19,535
But I'll remember today
for the rest of my life.

855
00:47:25,143 --> 00:47:29,245
The rest of my life.

856
00:47:33,618 --> 00:47:36,897
On the next
"gold rush: White water"...

857
00:47:36,921 --> 00:47:40,201
- Look at all that gold.
- Holy crap.

858
00:47:40,225 --> 00:47:42,303
It's good to be
on the winning team.

859
00:47:42,327 --> 00:47:44,538
We got to clear that rock.

860
00:47:44,562 --> 00:47:47,074
That rock falls on somebody,
it just plants you down there.

861
00:47:47,098 --> 00:47:48,509
There's no way to get you out.

862
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:52,112
There's a lot of tension
on that rock.

863
00:47:52,136 --> 00:47:54,915
We are here to save the day!

864
00:47:54,939 --> 00:47:57,818
Let me get the story right.
This is where I was born.

865
00:47:57,842 --> 00:47:59,220
Now we're gonna have some fun.

866
00:47:59,244 --> 00:48:01,377
3... 2... 1...
