    OF BEAM BACK INTO PLACE.

283
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:43,588
              OPA!

284
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,723
              SON OF A [BLEEP].
             [BLEEP] RIVER, MAN.

285
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:50,195
  Carlos: OH! WHOA!

286
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:52,330
              -OH!
        -[BLEEP] [BLEEP].

287
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,798
     I GOT YOU.
I GOT YOU, GOT YOU, GOT YOU.

288
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,633
 HEY, HOLD IT. HOLD ON. PULL IT!
   PULL IT! PULL IT! PULL IT!

289
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:56,768
           I'M CAUGHT.
            -GOT YOU?

290
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,603
             -YEAH.
 -DON'T GET IN THE PINCH POINT.

291
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:00,939
              GET OUT OF THERE!

292
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:02,440
        GET OUT OF THERE!
            -GOT IT.

293
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:04,242
                 THANK YOU!
                 ALL RIGHT.

294
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:05,810
                  HOLD ON.
                THAT WAS BAD.

295
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:07,478
        LET'S NOT DO THAT AGAIN.

296
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,850
  THE HARDEST PART IS THIS WATER
              WANTS TO EAT US.

297
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:14,252
GUYS, WE GOT TO FIX THIS BRIDGE.
         COME ON, GUYS.

298
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:15,453
Carlos: COME ON, MAN.
     YOU GOT IT!

299
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:16,955
      NOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE
        TO LIFT THAT UP.

300
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:18,890
  HERE WE GO, MAN!
     COMING UP.

301
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:21,359
     YEAH, YEAH.
THIS IS GOING TO WORK.

302
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,827
           ALL RIGHT.

303
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:25,697
     I NEED THIS BOARD TO BE
   JACKED UP WHEN I LIFT THIS.

304
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,498
                Carlos: OKAY.

305
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,833
               COME ON, GUYS.
                COME ON, MAN.

307
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,237
   -THAT'S IT! THAT'S IT, MAN!
      -THAT'S THE RIGHT...

308
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:34,205
              WHY DON'T WE PUT
             A TOURNIQUET ON IT?

309
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:37,108
             GOT IT.
 -CARLOS TIES A ROPE TOURNIQUET

310
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,078
      TO PULL THE TWO PARTS
      OF THE BEAM TOGETHER.

311
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,279
 WHAT ARE YOU GOING
 TO TWIST THAT WITH?

312
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:43,581
            A PIPE OR SOMETHING.

313
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:44,849
           YEAH, DUDE!

314
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:47,051
        THAT'LL HOLD IT.

315
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:51,789
Dustin: GOING TO BRACE IT UP
  WITH SOME BOARDS.

316
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:55,960
WE'RE GOING TO PUT SOME BOARDS
ON THE INSIDE AND THE OUTSIDE.

317
00:14:57,163 --> 00:14:59,330
    -THAT SHOULD BE IT, HUH?
     -I THINK THAT'LL DO US.

318
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:01,933
                     AH!

319
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:06,704
  TWO MORE BOARDS,
   WE'LL BE DONE!

320
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:08,139
                 THAT'S IT!

321
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:10,441
           ALL RIGHT!
      WELL, WE GOT IT DONE.

322
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:13,144
        -GOOD JOB, GUYS.
         -GOOD JOB, MAN.

323
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:14,612
           HELL YEAH!

324
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:16,614
  WE PUT IT RIGHT BACK TOGETHER
 WITH BUBBLE GUM AND DUCT TAPE,

325
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:20,485
   BUT IT'S TOGETHER, AND IT'S
 CROSSABLE, SO THAT'S A BRIDGE.

326
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:23,621
     I MEAN, THE REAL WORLD,
    THIS IS A PIECE OF TRASH,

327
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:26,157
           BUT [BLEEP]
  THIS IS BEAUTIFUL HERE, MAN.

328
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:33,331
            Narrator:
     NEXT DAY, DOWN AT THEIR
 BASE CAMP ON PORCUPINE CREEK...

329
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,732
        -SO DUCT TAPE IT.
           -ALL RIGHT.

330
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:37,101
         -THAT SOUNDS...
        -IT'LL GET US BY.

331
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:40,271
            Narrator:
       ...FRED AND NEW GUY
      RICH ARE REASSEMBLING

332
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:44,509
      THE DREDGE THEY USED
          LAST SEASON.

333
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:48,813
   THIS IS THE OLD DREDGE THAT
WE WERE USING, NICE AND COMPACT.

334
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:53,718
 BASICALLY, ALL THIS THING IS IS
  A GIANT WATER VACUUM CLEANER.

335
00:15:56,056 --> 00:16:00,858
            Narrator:
     THIS SEASON, DUSTIN HAS
       A SECRET WEAPON...

336
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,294
      OH, GET OUT OF TOWN, DUDE!

337
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:09,033
  ...A BRAND-NEW $17,000 DREDGE
      CAPABLE OF PROCESSING

338
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:16,607
  12 YARDS OF PAY DIRT AN HOUR,
TWICE AS MUCH AS FRED'S OLD ONE.

339
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:20,211
  Carlos: THIS FRICKING SLUICE
     IS FRICKING HUGE, MAN!

340
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:23,915
    FROM POINT A TO POINT B,
    IT HAS ITS OWN ZIP CODE.

341
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:26,417
      NO GOLD IS EVER GOING
         TO ESCAPE THIS.

342
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:27,752
                     NO.

343
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:29,153
HOW MUCH DIRT ARE WE GOING
TO MOVE WITH [BLEEP]?

344
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,356
             I'M HOPING AT LEAST
               TWICE AS MUCH.

345
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:34,125
              -GAH!
        -THE DREDGE IS...

346
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:36,427
               IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

347
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:37,628
          IT'S ABOUT...
              -GOD.

348
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,630
    ...THREE TIMES THE SIZE,
          SURFACE SIZE.

349
00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:41,733
  THIS FIXES ALL OUR PROBLEMS.

350
00:16:41,735 --> 00:16:44,002
WHAT THE HELL YOU GOT
  OVER HERE ANYWAY?

351
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:45,703
             Dustin:
      A GIANT-SIZED DREDGE.

352
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:47,572
                    YEP.
              STEP IT RIGHT IN.

353
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:51,442
OUR SLUICE BOX IS JUST ABOUT THE
 SAME SIZE AS YOUR FULL DREDGE.

354
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:54,245
BIGGER ISN'T NECESSARILY BETTER.

355
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:55,513
             Dustin:
      FRED WON'T ADMIT IT,

356
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:56,981
      BUT HE WANTS TO WORK
      OFF OF THIS MACHINE.

357
00:16:56,983 --> 00:17:00,118
   HE'S LOOKING AT HIS LITTLE,
      BITTY TOY OVER THERE,

358
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,453
        AND HE'S FEELING
      A LITTLE INADEQUATE.

359
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:04,689
    THERE IT IS.

360
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,691
     AND WE'RE READY TO GO.

361
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:09,127
      IT'S GOING TO MAKE ME
         SOME GOLD NOW.

362
00:17:09,129 --> 00:17:11,763
     ALL WE GOT TO DO IS GET
  IT UP THERE AND GET STARTED.

363
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:18,636
            Narrator:
  WITH TWO DREDGES THIS SEASON,
         FATHER AND SON

364
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:22,140
         WILL BE WORKING
     TOGETHER SIDE BY SIDE.

365
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:27,545
   THESE ARE DUSTIN'S CLAIMS.

366
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:33,084
TECHNICALLY, I'M WORKING FOR HIM
      BUT BASICALLY AS A...

367
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:34,886
   MAYBE I'LL BE AN OLD SAGE,

368
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:38,923
     AN ADVISOR OR SOMETHING
         OF THAT NATURE.

369
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:40,358
Dustin: A LITTLE BIT
  OF LUMBER COMING.

370
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,494
              Wes: EVENTUALLY,
         WE'RE GOING TO NEED IT.

371
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:46,664
FRED, THAT'S NOT JUST
A LITTLE BIT OF LUMBER, MAN.

372
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,232
WE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THIS,

373
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,834
THAT I DIDN'T WANT YOU BUILDING
A WHOLE BUNCH OF STUFF.

374
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:51,102
       I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
         -I JUST SAID...

375
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:52,503
       NO, NO.
     I'M NOT...

376
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:54,605
SO IF YOU NEED PIECES OF LUMBER,
             HOW DO YOU GET THEM

377
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:55,973
          OUT THERE...
       -WHAT DO I NEED...

378
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:58,409
         -...CARRY THEM?
      -...LUMBER FOR, FRED?

379
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,578
    THERE'S NOTHING ON THE OTHER
              SIDE OF THE CREEK

380
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,080
              TO EVEN WALK ON.

381
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,548
        EVERYTHING IS...
     -WE'RE NOT BUILDING...

382
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,816
         -...LIKE THIS.
         -...THIS YEAR.

383
00:18:04,818 --> 00:18:06,417
 WE'RE NOT BUILDING.

384
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:09,554
HOW ABOUT IF I JUST LEAVE ALL OF
       THAT SITTING RIGHT THERE,

385
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:11,589
                 AND<i> YOU</i> PAY
             THE HELICOPTER BILL

                 OUT THERE?

387
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:17,228
      WATCH YOURSELF DOWN THERE.

388
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:24,735
 WELL, I'M JUST PLANNING AHEAD.

389
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:27,905
  Dustin: FRED IS GOING TO DECK
 THE ENTIRE CREEK IF I LET HIM,

390
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:31,375
     AND WE'RE NOT BUILDING
     A WHOLE BUNCH OF STUFF.

391
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:35,146
  IT'S NOT HAPPENING THIS YEAR,
AND WE'VE HAD THESE DISCUSSIONS,

392
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:38,382
         AND HE DECIDED
    HE WAS GOING TO GO AHEAD

393
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:40,118
   AND BUY THE LUMBER ANYWAY.

394
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,053
                    OKAY.
            THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

395
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:44,622
     HE'S GOT NO RIGHT TO DO
       ANY OF THIS STUFF.

396
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,023
                  YES, SIR.
                  YOU TOO.

397
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:48,526
     HE DON'T OWN ANYTHING.
     HIS NAME IS ON NOTHING.

398
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:51,329
       IT'S JUST, SOMEHOW,
    HE THINKS HE'S IN CHARGE,

399
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:55,533
  AND THIS IS WHERE WE GET INTO
  TROUBLE, BUT I'M IN CONTROL.

400
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:57,268
    IT'S NOT GOING UP THERE.

00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:25,463

  OUR STUFF INTO THE DIVE SITE.

  HELICOPTER LIFT MAY GO WRONG,

406

      MIGHT GET DESTROYED,

407
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:40,912
     AND THAT'LL BE THE END
       OF EVERYTHING HERE

408
00:19:40,914 --> 00:19:43,514
BECAUSE I CAN'T BUY ANOTHER ONE.
