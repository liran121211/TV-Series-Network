00:39:48,827 --> 00:39:50,758
Man: THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF GOLD
RIGHT THERE ACTUALLY.

854
00:40:07,034 --> 00:40:08,827
IF FRED SAID IT'S GOLD,

855
00:40:08,862 --> 00:40:10,689
Man: THAT'S OUR FIRST GOLD
OF THE SEASON.

858
00:40:14,862 --> 00:40:17,310
THE CURRENT GOT HIM,
BUT DAMNED

859
00:40:17,344 --> 00:40:19,862
IF HE DIDN'T FIND
SOME GOLD ALONG WITH IT.

860
00:40:19,896 --> 00:40:21,931
EXCUSE ME, MAN.
I WANT TO [BLEEP] DIVE, DUDE.

READY TO GET IN THE WATER.

00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,310
Dustin:
THIS IS THE REAL DEAL.

867
00:40:38,344 --> 00:40:41,103
THIS IS DANGEROUS,
AND THIS IS A LOT OF WORK.

868
00:40:41,137 --> 00:40:42,448
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

871
00:40:52,379 --> 00:40:53,344
ARE YOU [BLEEP] KIDDING ME?

872
00:40:53,379 --> 00:40:56,344
Man:
I'M NOT [BLEEP] KIDDING.

873
00:40:56,379 --> 00:40:57,827
Wes:
WE'RE ON THE GOLD ALREADY.

874
00:40:57,862 --> 00:40:59,551
IT'S ONLY GOING TO
GET BETTER FROM HERE.

875
00:40:59,586 --> 00:41:03,413
THE FRICKING WATER

876
00:41:03,448 --> 00:41:06,827
Man: THERE IS NO AIR IN THIS
MASK. OH, NEVER MIND.

877
00:41:06,862 --> 00:41:09,551
Fred: SICK AND TIRED
OF THE BULL[BLEEP].

878
00:41:09,586 --> 00:41:12,931
Carlos:
I KNOW A LOT OF DIVERS WHO HAVE
BEEN KILLED 15, 10 FEET OF WATER

879
00:41:12,965 --> 00:41:16,000
