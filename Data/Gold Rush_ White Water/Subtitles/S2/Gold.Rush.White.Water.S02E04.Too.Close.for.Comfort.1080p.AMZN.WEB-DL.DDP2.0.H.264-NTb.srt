00:39:34,275 --> 00:39:36,448
LOOK AT THAT [BLEEP].

Carlos: [BLEEP] DANG RIGHT,
PAUL. YOU'RE THE FREAKING MAN.

693
00:39:48,965 --> 00:39:52,379
DID YOU SEE IT? GOOD JOB.

694
00:39:52,413 --> 00:39:54,448
HEY, FRED, WE HIT
THAT HARDPACK, MAN.

695
00:39:54,482 --> 00:39:55,965
SOUNDS LIKE THAT GOOD STUFF,
MAN!

696
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,517
THAT'S GOOD! FINALLY!

697
00:39:57,551 --> 00:40:02,931
IT'S BEEN CREEPING IN MY DREAMS
FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR NOW.

698
00:40:02,965 --> 00:40:04,103
I NEED TO FIND OUT

699
00:40:04,137 --> 00:40:06,724
WHERE THE GOLD'S AT
BELOW THAT HARDPACK.

700
00:40:06,758 --> 00:40:08,448
WE'RE RIGHT BACK ON TRACK.

701
00:40:08,482 --> 00:40:10,931
WE'RE DOWN TO THAT HARDPACK,
SO NOW WE'VE JUST GOT TO BE

702
00:40:10,965 --> 00:40:14,310
WITHIN A COUPLE OF FEET
OF BEING ON BEDROCK.

703
00:40:14,344 --> 00:40:16,655
WE ALL KNOW WHAT'S GONNA BE
RUNNING DOWN

704
00:40:16,689 --> 00:40:20,896
RIGHT AT THE BOTTOM OF A GLACIER
IN A NICE LITTLE V-FORMATION.

705
00:40:20,931 --> 00:40:25,137
THE HEAVIEST STUFF -- GOLD.

706
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:28,172
FROM THIS DAY FORWARD,
WE SHOULD GET REALLY GOOD GOLD.

707
00:40:28,206 --> 00:40:30,206
THERE'S JUST NO EXCUSE FOR IT.

708
00:40:30,241 --> 00:40:34,517
WE'RE AT LEAST 12 FEET DEEP
RIGHT NOW.

[BLEEP].
THAT'S A LONG WAY DOWN.

710
00:40:37,413 --> 00:40:40,862
I'VE HAD SO MANY DAMN PROBLEMS
THAT IT HAS TAKEN ME

711
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:44,103
A LOT LONGER THAN
I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA TAKE.

712
00:40:44,137 --> 00:40:46,827
BUT WE'RE ONLY HALFWAY
THROUGH THE SEASON,

713
00:40:46,862 --> 00:40:49,448
AND WE'RE EXACTLY
WHERE WE ENDED LAST SEASON

714
00:40:49,482 --> 00:40:54,000
SO I NEED TO FIND
A GOLD STREAK IN HERE

715
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:57,310
AND FOLLOW IT WHEREVER THE HELL
IT GOES AND LINE MY POCKETS

716
00:40:57,344 --> 00:41:00,000

BEAUTIFUL, SWEET GOLD.
