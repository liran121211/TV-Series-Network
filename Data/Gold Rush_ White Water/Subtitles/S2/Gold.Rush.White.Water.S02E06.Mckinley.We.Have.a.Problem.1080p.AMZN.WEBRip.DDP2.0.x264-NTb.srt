1
00:00:05,344 --> 00:00:10,320
What in the hell?
Look at the water.

2
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:11,838
Hey, Paul.

3
00:00:11,862 --> 00:00:14,182
Coming up a little bit,
a little bit of sticks, man,

4
00:00:14,206 --> 00:00:15,517
a little bit of debris.

5
00:00:48,586 --> 00:00:50,700
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday!

6
00:00:50,724 --> 00:00:52,251
Happy birthday, Fred!
Happy birthday, Fred!

7
00:00:52,275 --> 00:00:54,493
75 years old.
You're old.

8
00:00:56,793 --> 00:00:59,976
75 years old,
still diving in Alaska?

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,758
That's pretty impressive.

10
00:01:14,724 --> 00:01:16,803
He started to panic down there..

11
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:19,286
That's how dangerous this is.

12
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:21,355
We're going to do our first fuel
drop down the mountain.

13
00:01:21,379 --> 00:01:24,344
The crazy that
we do to mine in Alaska.

14
00:01:34,793 --> 00:01:36,044
We're that close to the gold.

15
00:01:36,068 --> 00:01:39,631
We're in business, boys.
A little nugget.

18
00:02:08,275 --> 00:02:11,182
Well, the water is not
perfectly clear this morning, but...

19
00:02:11,206 --> 00:02:14,562
It's nice.
It's not milky.

20
00:02:14,586 --> 00:02:18,872
All right. About a foot,
foot and a half of visibility.

21
00:02:18,896 --> 00:02:23,079
The Dakota boys are 10
weeks into their mining season,

22
00:02:23,103 --> 00:02:24,976
dredging for gold
in one of Alaska's

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,286
most remote
and dangerous creeks.

24
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:35,113
Hey, guys!
Right here.

25
00:02:35,137 --> 00:02:38,700
This is our entire reason
for being here, right here.

26
00:02:38,724 --> 00:02:41,010
So you know how the crack
goes all the way down,

27
00:02:41,034 --> 00:02:43,355
if you were trying
to build a nugget trap,

28
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:45,527
this is what it would look like.

29
00:02:45,551 --> 00:02:48,044
I just believe it's going to be
chock full of gold,

30
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:49,700
and now we need to clean it out.

31
00:02:49,724 --> 00:02:53,527
So the hole has to go forward
in order to do this.

32
00:02:53,551 --> 00:02:55,079
Well, I can't wait
to get into this.

33
00:02:55,103 --> 00:02:57,724
Man, this is... it looks like
a good day to dive.

34
00:02:59,551 --> 00:03:01,344
Last week...

35
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,079
...Dustin discovered a crack
in the creek wall...

36
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,803
Yeah!
Yes, it is!

37
00:03:08,827 --> 00:03:11,148
...that gave them
their biggest cleanup yet.

38
00:03:11,172 --> 00:03:13,034
Now we're getting
into gold, baby.

39
00:03:15,103 --> 00:03:18,976
Now Dustin needs his crew
to dredge down through the rocks

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,010
and gravel to the pile of gold

41
00:03:22,034 --> 00:03:24,344
at the bottom
of the bedrock crack.

42
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:28,976
We're throwing the dice.

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,424
This is what we're going for.

44
00:03:30,448 --> 00:03:32,424
This is our focus.
All right.

45
00:03:32,448 --> 00:03:34,103
Let's get to work, guys.

46
00:03:36,206 --> 00:03:39,113
So, today, we have to open
the hole up more

47
00:03:39,137 --> 00:03:42,872
so we can get down to the crack.

48
00:03:42,896 --> 00:03:47,182
That promise of the pot of gold
at the end of the rainbow,

49
00:03:47,206 --> 00:03:50,493
I think,
is in every man's heart.

50
00:03:50,517 --> 00:03:51,976
That's what drives you on.

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,286
Some men have more of that drive
than others.

52
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,872
Dustin and I have got it.

53
00:03:57,896 --> 00:04:02,079
Dustin has invested
$75,000 in this season.

54
00:04:02,103 --> 00:04:04,769
He needs it to pay off,
or he'll lose it all,

55
00:04:04,793 --> 00:04:08,320
and none of his crew
will get paid.

56
00:04:08,344 --> 00:04:11,275
I'm going to get
the gold out of this hole.

57
00:04:14,827 --> 00:04:17,320
Diving alongside
him is rich Webster.

58
00:04:17,344 --> 00:04:23,113
I'm ready to rock and roll.
Start getting back to digging,

59
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:25,793
see if we can get down
to some good ole yellow gold.

60
00:05:58,206 --> 00:06:02,044
After 4 hours, Dustin
and rich are 12 feet down,

61
00:06:02,068 --> 00:06:04,206
just 3 feet from bedrock.

62
00:06:55,655 --> 00:06:59,355
Whoa.
Was scary.

63
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:01,137
I was out of air, dude.

64
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:28,251
That's the most scariest thing
that's ever happened

65
00:07:28,275 --> 00:07:29,907
to me diving.
Yeah, I bet.

66
00:07:29,931 --> 00:07:31,251
Thank god you were
pulling me, dude,

67
00:07:31,275 --> 00:07:32,700
because I couldn't
get up fast enough.

68
00:07:32,724 --> 00:07:34,148
I was yanking as hard
as I could.

69
00:07:34,172 --> 00:07:37,872
That was good because I
wouldn't have got out in time.

70
00:07:37,896 --> 00:07:39,769
That thing smashed
against my face so hard

71
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,320
when I went to take a breath.

72
00:07:41,344 --> 00:07:42,907
Panicked?

73
00:07:42,931 --> 00:07:43,976
I started to.

74
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,907
I know.

75
00:07:45,931 --> 00:07:48,527
Casey saved my ass.

76
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:49,965
He saved my ass.

77
00:07:52,275 --> 00:07:55,493
Yeah, that was bad.
Sorry, man.

78
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:58,665
Glad I got you out.
Thank you. Thank you.

79
00:07:58,689 --> 00:08:00,665
I know.
I owe you one.

80
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,413
You're all right, dude.

81
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,631
That's probably one of
the scariest rescues

82
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:09,665
we've ever had to do.

83
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,907
He started to panic down there.

84
00:08:11,931 --> 00:08:14,734
That's how dangerous this is.

85
00:08:14,758 --> 00:08:18,424
We got to check
that pop-off valve.

86
00:08:18,448 --> 00:08:20,320
The hose clip
connecting the air lines

87
00:08:20,344 --> 00:08:22,527
to the compressor has blown.

88
00:08:22,551 --> 00:08:24,562
Before anyone can dive again,

89
00:08:24,586 --> 00:08:27,665
Wes switches it out
for a threaded brass coupling.

90
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:28,907
Yeah.

91
00:08:28,931 --> 00:08:30,596
This is the lifeline
to the diver right now.

92
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,424
We can't afford for this hose
to come off of there like that.

93
00:08:33,448 --> 00:08:36,079
I'm going to give it a shot
and squeeze it down some more.

94
00:08:36,103 --> 00:08:38,734
We'll run it for a little bit
and see if we can get it

95
00:08:38,758 --> 00:08:40,941
to continually run
without popping up.

96
00:08:40,965 --> 00:08:44,182
Luckily, we just happen to have
a tool here to crimp this stuff.

97
00:08:44,206 --> 00:08:45,838
So I think I got that crimped
tight enough

98
00:08:45,862 --> 00:08:48,251
that maybe it will stay
on here this time.

99
00:08:48,275 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm hoping, anyway.

100
00:08:52,068 --> 00:08:54,079
Let's see if that does the trick
right there, a quick fix.

101
00:08:54,103 --> 00:08:56,275
Hopefully, that's going
to take care of it.

102
00:08:59,275 --> 00:09:01,907
So, Fred, is it
back working again?

103
00:09:01,931 --> 00:09:03,389
It's working fine.

104
00:09:03,413 --> 00:09:06,355
The pressure-relief valve
is working perfectly.

105
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,355
Did we double-hose clamp that?

106
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:09,458
Yes.
I did.

107
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:10,562
Awesome.
You're the man.

108
00:09:10,586 --> 00:09:12,527
Sorry to ask.

109
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:15,941
It happened to me in the
Mississippi river at 80 feet.

110
00:09:15,965 --> 00:09:18,803
I made it to within 5 feet of
the surface before the guy says,

111
00:09:18,827 --> 00:09:21,172
"oh, okay.
Here's what the problem is."

112
00:09:23,827 --> 00:09:27,631
One breath,
and there was nothing.

113
00:09:27,655 --> 00:09:30,389
Believe me.
I was coming up.

114
00:09:30,413 --> 00:09:33,182
I think they call them
near-misses.

115
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:34,320
So I'm going to go back down.

116
00:09:34,344 --> 00:09:35,700
I'm going to get back
in the saddle.

117
00:09:35,724 --> 00:09:38,079
I don't think you should.

118
00:09:38,103 --> 00:09:41,217
You need to get your head
right for this situation.

119
00:09:41,241 --> 00:09:42,838
You had an event today.

120
00:09:42,862 --> 00:09:45,182
I don't think you need to be
back in the water no more today.

121
00:09:45,206 --> 00:09:46,931
Come on out.

122
00:09:51,034 --> 00:09:52,631
You all right, man?

123
00:09:52,655 --> 00:09:54,079
When I heard, "diver up!
Diver up!"

124
00:09:54,103 --> 00:09:56,872
I just turned and started
to come up the wall,

125
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,113
and it was like

126
00:09:58,137 --> 00:10:01,976
That mask went
to my face so hard,

127
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,596
and it's the first time
that I seriously

128
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,596
Started to panic.

129
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,769
It is terrifying.

130
00:10:08,793 --> 00:10:13,068
The best medicine is to get
back in that damn water.

131
00:10:22,551 --> 00:10:24,379
Up next...

132
00:10:27,034 --> 00:10:29,251
Nugget!
That's gold, buddy.

133
00:10:29,275 --> 00:10:30,931
We're getting closer.

134
00:10:41,137 --> 00:10:45,206
The best medicine is to get
back in that damn water.

135
00:10:48,862 --> 00:10:51,838
All right. I'm going.

136
00:10:51,862 --> 00:10:53,562
I'm going.

137
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:58,182
On his last dive, rich
panicked when his air supply failed.

138
00:10:58,206 --> 00:11:02,320
Now he's bucking his fears,
getting back in the raging creek

139
00:11:02,344 --> 00:11:04,251
and down to the nugget trap.

140
00:11:04,275 --> 00:11:06,320
I'd be lying if I said
I wasn't a little nervous,

141
00:11:06,344 --> 00:11:07,458
but I'm going to go back down.

142
00:11:07,482 --> 00:11:09,631
I'm going to get back in saddle.

143
00:11:09,655 --> 00:11:11,655
I just got to get through today.

144
00:11:24,758 --> 00:11:25,793
Richard, you're clear
to go down.

145
00:11:37,517 --> 00:11:40,931
Dustin heads back
into the creek with rich.

146
00:12:49,965 --> 00:12:51,665
Over thousands of years,

147
00:12:51,689 --> 00:12:54,769
gravity compresses gravel
on the creek bed

148
00:12:54,793 --> 00:12:58,079
into a dense layer
known as hardpack.

149
00:12:58,103 --> 00:13:02,275
This is now all that stands
between them and the gold.

150
00:13:10,034 --> 00:13:13,665
The hardpack is too
tough for the suction hose.

151
00:13:13,689 --> 00:13:14,793
We're coming up.

152
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:25,665
We got the air chisel.

153
00:13:25,689 --> 00:13:27,251
We have it.
It's ready.

154
00:13:27,275 --> 00:13:29,424
We should stick it down there
today, actually,

155
00:13:29,448 --> 00:13:34,310
but tomorrow we're going
to hit this really hard.

156
00:13:37,137 --> 00:13:38,562
Good job today, fellows.

157
00:13:38,586 --> 00:13:40,838
All right.
Let's get the hell out of here.

158
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:45,355
Tomorrow, we'll be digging
through hardpack.

159
00:13:45,379 --> 00:13:47,182
I don't think that
that hardpack is more

160
00:13:47,206 --> 00:13:51,010
than 2 or 3 feet deep
at the most.

161
00:13:51,034 --> 00:13:52,769
We're that close to the gold.

162
00:14:12,896 --> 00:14:16,665
They mined in this
area about 100 years ago,

163
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:20,769
and it takes over 100 years
to make this rock like it is,

164
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:24,010
so we know that no one
has mined here before.

165
00:14:24,034 --> 00:14:26,458
In order to make this rock
this way, you have

166
00:14:26,482 --> 00:14:30,010
to have thousands of years,
and that's what it took.

167
00:14:30,034 --> 00:14:32,562
A lot of people call this
false bedrock.

168
00:14:32,586 --> 00:14:34,907
Right below this is where
the gold is sitting.

169
00:14:34,931 --> 00:14:36,769
We just got to get through it.

170
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:40,113
That hardpack has got
that prehistoric cement.

171
00:14:40,137 --> 00:14:42,424
Caveman concrete, brother.

172
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:44,907
To break through the
hardpack, the crew will use

173
00:14:44,931 --> 00:14:47,931
a pneumatic hammer
powered by an air compressor.

174
00:14:50,517 --> 00:14:53,320
Each strike delivers
150 pounds of pressure

175
00:14:53,344 --> 00:14:59,562
to the hardened steel chisel
3,000 times a minute.

176
00:15:04,758 --> 00:15:06,838
So when he gets down there,
underneath the water,

177
00:15:06,862 --> 00:15:08,838
he's going to essentially
get all this hardpack,

178
00:15:08,862 --> 00:15:13,010
and he's just going
to try to break it up,

179
00:15:13,034 --> 00:15:15,458
pulverize it where he can
suck it into the dredge.

180
00:15:15,482 --> 00:15:17,424
There's a lot of golf
mixed into that hardpack,

181
00:15:17,448 --> 00:15:19,769
and there's a whole lot of gold
underneath the hardpack,

182
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,137
which is what we're after.

183
00:15:23,344 --> 00:15:27,389
Diving with Carlos
today is 74-year-old Fred.

184
00:15:27,413 --> 00:15:29,493
He's going to use
the air chipper.

185
00:15:29,517 --> 00:15:33,562
As he chips, I'll be sucking up
the debris on the bottom,

186
00:15:33,586 --> 00:15:36,010
and we're going to
get after that thing.

187
00:15:36,034 --> 00:15:38,000
Ready?
Let's dive!

188
00:15:52,931 --> 00:15:54,068
We're in business, kids.

189
00:16:02,413 --> 00:16:03,527
Right there.
Yep.

190
00:16:03,551 --> 00:16:05,482
Okay. Here it comes,
brother. Let's do this.

191
00:16:10,827 --> 00:16:12,862
Bright orange hose.

192
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,320
Perfect.
All right.

193
00:16:22,344 --> 00:16:23,517
Let's see how he does.

194
00:16:34,862 --> 00:16:36,000
Wow.

195
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,355
We're getting
desperate for fuel.

196
00:17:35,379 --> 00:17:37,965
I think we need to
check all these fuel barrels.

197
00:17:58,931 --> 00:18:01,838
Oh, my.
We ran out of fuel.

198
00:18:01,862 --> 00:18:04,631
I have no idea
what we're going to do.

199
00:18:04,655 --> 00:18:07,700
Ah!

200
00:18:07,724 --> 00:18:11,655
Oh, Dustin, man.
It was a rookie mistake.

201
00:18:14,034 --> 00:18:15,286
We're in trouble.

202
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,320
We don't have a single barrel
left of fuel,

203
00:18:17,344 --> 00:18:20,527
and I don't know how I missed
this, but I missed it.

204
00:18:20,551 --> 00:18:23,320
I think I'm going through
about a barrel and a half

205
00:18:23,344 --> 00:18:28,551
per week right now,
maybe two barrels.

206
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,665
Between the engines
on each dredge,

207
00:18:40,689 --> 00:18:44,596
generators, and the compressor
for the air hammer, fuel costs

208
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:49,631
Dustin $1,500 a week.

209
00:18:49,655 --> 00:18:53,803
Without any fuel,
these things don't run.

210
00:18:53,827 --> 00:18:56,838
It's just that simple.
We need fuel,

211
00:18:56,862 --> 00:19:00,448
otherwise everybody
take a big long vacation.

212
00:19:02,758 --> 00:19:04,137
No fuel, no gold.

213
00:19:16,103 --> 00:19:17,734
In the back country,

214
00:19:17,758 --> 00:19:20,320
35 miles north of
Haines, Alaska,

215
00:19:20,344 --> 00:19:23,493
the Dakota boys are shut down.

216
00:19:23,517 --> 00:19:26,310
No fuel means no gold mining.

217
00:19:30,103 --> 00:19:35,182
Getting fuel to where I need
it is really hard.

218
00:19:35,206 --> 00:19:37,217
The helicopters kind of jacked
up their price

219
00:19:37,241 --> 00:19:39,286
a little bit on us,

220
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:42,458
which I don't have the money
to start throwing at fuel

221
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:44,769
like I used to.

222
00:19:44,793 --> 00:19:50,320
To avoid a $2,000 heli
lift, Dustin risks a bush resupply.

223
00:19:50,344 --> 00:19:53,769
How about we hook it up
and then run a zipper across it?

224
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:56,424
We can do that.

225
00:19:56,448 --> 00:19:59,148
What I'm trying to do
is get this 55-gallon drum

226
00:19:59,172 --> 00:20:03,113
400 feet across this ravine
that's about 300-feet deep,

227
00:20:03,137 --> 00:20:05,344
and we don't want to drop it.

228
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,344
Watch your fingers.

229
00:20:10,655 --> 00:20:19,493
That's going to have
to be enough.

230
00:20:19,517 --> 00:20:22,700
All right. If that rope gets
stuck, it will untie itself,

231
00:20:22,724 --> 00:20:24,769
so I didn't think that through.

232
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:31,551
Come on, baby.

233
00:20:42,172 --> 00:20:43,827
Is that where you want it
right there?

234
00:20:54,965 --> 00:20:58,379
Dustin helied in the ATV
at the start of the season...

235
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,665
But when the dirt
road dead-ends,

236
00:21:03,689 --> 00:21:06,976
there's no way to lower
the 380-pound barrels

237
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,896
safely down the canyon
to the mine site.

238
00:21:15,137 --> 00:21:18,320
Now, we want to
build this long, long pipe

239
00:21:18,344 --> 00:21:20,320
down to another barrel.

240
00:21:20,344 --> 00:21:21,758
Super simple, right?

241
00:21:23,689 --> 00:21:27,734
They've already taken the
barrel over the zip wire from the camp,

242
00:21:27,758 --> 00:21:33,355
along the ATV trail
to the top of the canyon.

243
00:21:33,379 --> 00:21:37,286
Now, they'll connect
4510-foot steel pipes

244
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:41,907
to get the fuel down the
450-foot drop to McKinley creek

245
00:21:41,931 --> 00:21:45,251
and directly into an
empty barrel at the bottom.

246
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:54,838
Yeah, I've got to put sealant on
this... these,

247
00:21:54,862 --> 00:21:56,493
before I put them together.

248
00:21:56,517 --> 00:21:58,044
I can't have gas leaking out
of any of it

249
00:21:58,068 --> 00:21:59,493
because it's gonna have
a lot of pressure by the time

250
00:21:59,517 --> 00:22:01,355
it gets to the bottom,
so all these joints have got to

251
00:22:01,379 --> 00:22:05,251
have some kind of compound
on them so they won't leak.

252
00:22:05,275 --> 00:22:06,769
Now the trick is going to be,

253
00:22:06,793 --> 00:22:09,182
"can we put them together
going down the hill?"

254
00:22:09,206 --> 00:22:11,700
Yeah.
We definitely can.

255
00:22:11,724 --> 00:22:13,389
Ready?

256
00:22:22,827 --> 00:22:24,448
Okay.
Right there, it's good.

257
00:22:26,103 --> 00:22:27,286
We decided to go
with the metal pipe

258
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,113
because of the bears
and all the porcupines.

259
00:22:29,137 --> 00:22:31,424
They love to chew up anything
that's plastic,

260
00:22:31,448 --> 00:22:36,010
so the only way to keep them
from poking holes in our pipe,

261
00:22:36,034 --> 00:22:37,148
we had to go with metal.

262
00:22:37,172 --> 00:22:38,907
All right.
Ready to go again.

263
00:22:38,931 --> 00:22:39,941
Standby.

264
00:22:39,965 --> 00:22:41,631
Copy.

265
00:22:52,517 --> 00:22:56,044
Here it comes, Paul.
Copy that.

266
00:22:56,068 --> 00:22:57,734
So far, so good.

267
00:22:57,758 --> 00:22:59,827
We're about a foot
from the edge.

268
00:23:02,931 --> 00:23:06,838
Paul! Can you
send me down a piece?

269
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:16,769
It's going.
We got this.

270
00:23:16,793 --> 00:23:19,941
We're on a roll.

271
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:21,355
Talk about relaxing today.

272
00:23:21,379 --> 00:23:24,355
It was a pretty chill day,
though, right?

273
00:23:24,379 --> 00:23:25,389
Come on.
Not bad.

274
00:23:25,413 --> 00:23:27,389
Not bad at all.
Pretty chill.

275
00:23:27,413 --> 00:23:29,206
Hanging from the side
of a mountain.

276
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,182
The crazy
that we do to mine in Alaska.

277
00:23:59,793 --> 00:24:01,172
We got our pipe in.

278
00:24:04,931 --> 00:24:08,803
Well, this is the last
connection that I've got to do,

279
00:24:08,827 --> 00:24:11,769
and we're going to do our first
fuel drop down the mountain.

280
00:24:11,793 --> 00:24:14,010
So like this, now we have
a barrel at the top.

281
00:24:14,034 --> 00:24:16,631
We'll have a barrel down
at the bottom.

282
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:18,838
All we've got to do
is open our valve,

283
00:24:18,862 --> 00:24:22,424
and it should fill our barrel
down up here with fuel.

284
00:24:22,448 --> 00:24:24,010
Once we have this barrel
with fuel, then we can carry it

285
00:24:24,034 --> 00:24:26,700
back and forth
to the dredge site real easy.

286
00:24:26,724 --> 00:24:29,976
This is going to be
a lifesaver right here.

287
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,182
Dustin, you have a copy?
Yeah, I got you, man.

288
00:24:33,206 --> 00:24:35,010
What's up?

289
00:24:35,034 --> 00:24:36,458
Okay.
I'm ready on my end.

290
00:24:36,482 --> 00:24:39,769
Are you ready to receive
a little bit of fuel?

291
00:24:39,793 --> 00:24:41,517
Yeah.
Give me a little trickle.

292
00:24:43,655 --> 00:24:44,872
Just let me know when you see

293
00:24:44,896 --> 00:24:46,251
a little bit of fuel
out of the bottom.

294
00:24:46,275 --> 00:24:49,217
I am not going to let
very much through to start.

295
00:24:49,241 --> 00:24:50,803
Copy that.

296
00:24:50,827 --> 00:24:53,344
I'll let you know when something
happens, but nothing yet.

297
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,148
You should have a good
flow coming down.

298
00:24:59,172 --> 00:25:02,838
Still nothing, man.
Still nothing.

299
00:25:02,862 --> 00:25:04,286
What are you thinking, man?

300
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,931
I got my valve all the way open,
and there's nothing happening.

301
00:25:09,896 --> 00:25:11,389
I have all of my valves
open, too.

302
00:25:11,413 --> 00:25:13,803
That don't make sense.

303
00:25:13,827 --> 00:25:16,665
Let's try something else
then, huh?

304
00:25:16,689 --> 00:25:18,872
We do have that gas-powered
compressor down there

305
00:25:18,896 --> 00:25:20,665
that will put out 120 pounds

306
00:25:20,689 --> 00:25:22,424
if we can hook a line to it

307
00:25:22,448 --> 00:25:24,137
and just blow this right out.

308
00:25:27,241 --> 00:25:33,700
The compressor will fire a
jet of air down the 450-foot line.

309
00:25:33,724 --> 00:25:36,310
Whatever is in the line,
we're going to push it out.

310
00:25:40,068 --> 00:25:41,527
All right. I'm going
to fire this thing up,

311
00:25:41,551 --> 00:25:43,734
and let's see if we can get
a flow through here.

312
00:25:54,758 --> 00:25:56,217
Okay, I'm going to
send you some air.

313
00:25:56,241 --> 00:25:59,182
I have about 90 pounds of
pressure on the compressor.

314
00:25:59,206 --> 00:26:00,941
Let's see what that will do.

315
00:26:20,931 --> 00:26:24,044
Well, I'll find out shortly.

316
00:26:24,068 --> 00:26:25,527
Okay. Keep
your fingers crossed

317
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:26,872
that this is going
to come down this time.

318
00:26:26,896 --> 00:26:28,286
I've got everything hooked up,

319
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,827
and I'm going to try
to send you fuel again.

320
00:26:32,551 --> 00:26:34,241
Copy that.
Here we go.

321
00:26:44,517 --> 00:26:46,458
Yeah, got fuel.
I got fuel.

322
00:26:46,482 --> 00:26:48,320
That is amazing.

323
00:26:48,344 --> 00:26:51,803
This will save us
a lot of money.

324
00:26:51,827 --> 00:26:53,044
It's a great afternoon.

325
00:26:53,068 --> 00:26:55,907
We got it cleared,
got fuel going down.

326
00:26:55,931 --> 00:26:59,286
Now we can just concentrate
on getting past the hardpack.

327
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,527
It's all about finding
the gold now.

328
00:27:01,551 --> 00:27:03,482
I like it when a plan
comes together.

329
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:11,148
Dustin's new system will
save $500 on every barrel of fuel.

330
00:27:11,172 --> 00:27:13,286
Now we can get fuel,
get it up there.

331
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:16,113
This is so much cheaper,
and we're done with it.

332
00:27:16,137 --> 00:27:17,803
We got it.

333
00:27:23,172 --> 00:27:26,286
And it's got the
Dakota boys back smashing

334
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:28,655
through hardpack
to the bedrock gold.

335
00:28:14,413 --> 00:28:16,689
We're getting deep finally,
finally.

336
00:28:41,551 --> 00:28:45,838
The crew is just 2 1/2 feet
from bedrock.

337
00:28:45,862 --> 00:28:47,838
We're finally getting our depth
that we need.

338
00:28:47,862 --> 00:28:49,079
Once we get through
that hardpack,

339
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:51,896
it should be
gold city from there.

340
00:29:06,965 --> 00:29:08,113
Tomorrow should be the day.

341
00:29:08,137 --> 00:29:10,389
We should be able to get
through that hardpack.

342
00:29:10,413 --> 00:29:11,931
Hell, yeah.

343
00:29:34,241 --> 00:29:38,355
It rained like hell last night.
I didn't sleep a wink,

344
00:29:38,379 --> 00:29:40,424
so I've been
thinking about it all night.

345
00:29:40,448 --> 00:29:43,044
So the guys made it down there,

346
00:29:43,068 --> 00:29:46,976
and I wanted to know
what happened.

347
00:29:54,448 --> 00:29:58,148
That rain is something else.

348
00:29:58,172 --> 00:30:01,734
Overnight rainfall
high in the Chilkat mountains

349
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:06,700
has raised the water level
in McKinley creek by 3 feet.

350
00:30:06,724 --> 00:30:09,217
Getting pretty serious
down there right now,

351
00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:13,655
but mother nature never counted
on guys like Dustin and I.

352
00:30:15,724 --> 00:30:17,044
It could pick up
even more today.

353
00:30:17,068 --> 00:30:18,113
That's what I think
it's going to do

354
00:30:18,137 --> 00:30:19,631
because that big rock
is our marker.

355
00:30:19,655 --> 00:30:22,493
That marker right there always
tells me where we're at.

356
00:30:22,517 --> 00:30:24,079
Another foot high,

357
00:30:24,103 --> 00:30:26,251
the boulders are going to start
rolling into my hole.

358
00:30:26,275 --> 00:30:29,148
As soon as you start hearing
big boulders, I'm out.

359
00:30:29,172 --> 00:30:30,458
That's it.
We're done.

360
00:30:30,482 --> 00:30:31,803
That's how it works.
I mean, you get crushed

361
00:30:31,827 --> 00:30:33,665
at the bottom of this thing.
Right.

362
00:30:33,689 --> 00:30:35,976
Conditions
have gone from dangerous

363
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,665
to potentially lethal down
in the dive hole

364
00:30:38,689 --> 00:30:40,976
Dustin and Casey
are about to enter.

365
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,044
Casey, how about you
don't go down?

366
00:30:43,068 --> 00:30:44,527
I'll go down.

367
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:48,251
I have so much experience
in this stuff right here.

368
00:30:48,275 --> 00:30:50,251
I just don't want you
to get hurt.

369
00:30:50,275 --> 00:30:52,734
I have the most to gain
or lose from this,

370
00:30:52,758 --> 00:30:53,769
and I'll be down there.

371
00:30:53,793 --> 00:30:55,458
It will be me.

372
00:31:06,068 --> 00:31:09,079
Aw, that would
have been pretty bad.

373
00:31:09,103 --> 00:31:10,275
All right.

374
00:32:16,689 --> 00:32:20,976
Carlos acts
as a lookout upstream.

375
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,079
Looking pretty,
pretty hairy, brother.

376
00:32:23,103 --> 00:32:24,838
Pretty hairy.

377
00:32:24,862 --> 00:32:29,182
His safety zone is about as big
as this right here right now.

378
00:32:29,206 --> 00:32:30,389
That's why I'm looking, man.

379
00:32:30,413 --> 00:32:31,424
I'm looking for any kind of
debris,

380
00:32:31,448 --> 00:32:34,458
like branches, logs, anything.

381
00:32:34,482 --> 00:32:36,251
If you see that, that means
there's been

382
00:32:36,275 --> 00:32:37,907
a landslide up above.

383
00:32:37,931 --> 00:32:40,148
If we start hearing
that McKinley thunder,

384
00:32:40,172 --> 00:32:41,803
what I mean by McKinley thunder,

385
00:32:41,827 --> 00:32:44,562
those rocks roaring down.

386
00:32:44,586 --> 00:32:46,838
You can hear it.
It sounds like thunder.

387
00:32:46,862 --> 00:32:50,355
The rocks hitting each other,
rolling down,

388
00:32:50,379 --> 00:32:52,527
got to come up, man.

389
00:32:52,551 --> 00:32:54,241
Game over on that one.

390
00:33:24,448 --> 00:33:26,217
Well, I'm going to get
some measurements down here.

391
00:33:26,241 --> 00:33:30,286
The guys seem to think they keep
going down all the way.

392
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:33,493
Let's see how deep
they've actually got this.

393
00:33:33,517 --> 00:33:35,275
14 feet right there.

394
00:33:38,689 --> 00:33:42,286
At 14 feet,
Dustin is just inches away

395
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:44,724
from where they hit
gold last season.

396
00:34:33,517 --> 00:34:35,689
Oh, my.

397
00:34:39,793 --> 00:34:41,241
Whoa.

398
00:34:46,103 --> 00:34:49,010
Hey, guys.
Hey. Guess what.

399
00:34:49,034 --> 00:34:51,389
What?
We got gold.

400
00:34:51,413 --> 00:34:53,724
Little nugget!
Look at that.

401
00:34:56,206 --> 00:34:59,596
Laying right at the
freaking head of the box.

402
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,700
I'll be damned.
Oh, yeah.

403
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:02,941
There you go, dude.
That's nice.

404
00:35:02,965 --> 00:35:05,010
Look at that.
It's starting to happen.

405
00:35:05,034 --> 00:35:06,389
We're in business, boys.

406
00:35:06,413 --> 00:35:08,079
Oh, yeah.

407
00:35:08,103 --> 00:35:12,424
We're getting closer.
Hot damn.

408
00:35:12,448 --> 00:35:14,631
I almost want to dance,
but not yet.

409
00:35:14,655 --> 00:35:16,458
Not yet.

410
00:35:16,482 --> 00:35:18,206
Yeah!

411
00:35:20,586 --> 00:35:22,355
That's such a good sign.

412
00:35:22,379 --> 00:35:25,251
It's letting us know that we're
going in the right direction.

413
00:35:25,275 --> 00:35:28,068
That's gold, buddy.
We're getting closer.

414
00:35:35,103 --> 00:35:36,562
When Fred hurt was born,

415
00:35:36,586 --> 00:35:40,734
the United States was at war
with Germany and Japan.

416
00:35:40,758 --> 00:35:43,148
Hey, Fred.
Hey, Fred. Happy birthday!

417
00:35:43,172 --> 00:35:45,113
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday!

418
00:35:45,137 --> 00:35:47,320
Happy birthday, Fred!
Happy birthday, Fred.

419
00:35:47,344 --> 00:35:50,044
Lord, have mercy.
Happy birthday!

420
00:35:50,068 --> 00:35:53,389
Hello.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

421
00:35:53,413 --> 00:35:56,113
Whoo-hoo-hoo.
My old goat.

422
00:35:56,137 --> 00:35:58,700
75 years old.
You're old.

423
00:35:58,724 --> 00:36:00,389
I can handle it.

424
00:36:00,413 --> 00:36:03,217
Probably have to rest a little
bit more than the young ones do.

425
00:36:03,241 --> 00:36:04,286
That's all right.

426
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:08,862
Holy cow!
It is. Oh!

427
00:36:09,586 --> 00:36:14,286
75 years old, still
diving and hiking in Alaska.

428
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:16,562
Oh, man.
That's pretty impressive.

429
00:36:16,586 --> 00:36:18,113
If he wasn't working with us,

430
00:36:18,137 --> 00:36:20,320
I'm pretty sure he'd be close
to the grave right now,

431
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:23,976
but instead, we're keeping
his ass in shape.

432
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,838
Let's see, I think I'll plan
for about another 20, 25 years.

433
00:36:49,931 --> 00:36:53,079
Bad, bad medicine, brother.
Bad, bad medicine, man.

434
00:36:53,103 --> 00:36:56,148
She looks really hairy today.

435
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:59,769
So the water came up
a whole bunch overnight.

436
00:36:59,793 --> 00:37:01,596
The floods are here.

437
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,769
Have we been talking about it?

438
00:37:03,793 --> 00:37:06,596
It's happening.

439
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,941
I can take this just fine.

440
00:37:07,965 --> 00:37:09,596
It's as muddy
as the Mississippi.

441
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,044
I just hope a bunch of that

442
00:37:11,068 --> 00:37:12,907
Didn't wash back into our hole.

443
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:16,113
Heavy downpour tonight means
this hole is gone like

444
00:37:16,137 --> 00:37:17,907
we never did anything.

445
00:37:17,931 --> 00:37:19,562
With water levels rising,

446
00:37:19,586 --> 00:37:23,217
Dustin's in a race against time
to get through the hardpack.

447
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:27,286
He's inches away from a payday
2 years in the making.

448
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:30,527
It's been raining for a day
and a half, 2 days,

449
00:37:30,551 --> 00:37:33,044
getting pretty serious
down there right now.

450
00:37:33,068 --> 00:37:34,838
Weather like this, I'd
be more worried about a Boulder

451
00:37:34,862 --> 00:37:36,527
rolling down on my head
than anything else

452
00:37:36,551 --> 00:37:38,976
because the water
is already up high.

453
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,389
It comes up anymore,
and it could...

454
00:37:40,413 --> 00:37:41,355
Anything that we have up here...

455
00:37:41,379 --> 00:37:42,631
Right there.

456
00:37:42,655 --> 00:37:44,010
...it could wash it right down
on top of us,

457
00:37:44,034 --> 00:37:47,286
and we're just asking
for trouble if we do that.

458
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:51,320
All right, guys.
We are so close right now.

459
00:37:51,344 --> 00:37:53,137
I just got to get back
down to it.

460
00:38:53,103 --> 00:38:54,976
The storm,
high in the mountains,

461
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,631
is sending 500 tons of water
crashing down

462
00:38:58,655 --> 00:39:02,251
above Dustin's head
every minute.

463
00:39:02,275 --> 00:39:04,493
Hey, Paul, it's
coming up a little bit,

464
00:39:04,517 --> 00:39:06,862
a little bit of sticks, man,
a little bit of debris.

465
00:39:29,896 --> 00:39:32,665
The water is getting high.
It's getting dirty.

466
00:39:32,689 --> 00:39:36,655
Getting Dustin out in time,
that's what I'm worried about.

467
00:39:39,827 --> 00:39:42,217
I can't believe Dustin
is down in this.

468
00:39:42,241 --> 00:39:43,482
I really can't.

469
00:40:17,724 --> 00:40:19,631
What in the hell?

470
00:40:19,655 --> 00:40:23,320
Look at the water.

471
00:40:23,344 --> 00:40:27,458
My anticipation is that it had
some sort of landslide

472
00:40:27,482 --> 00:40:29,113
came up the side
of the mountain,

473
00:40:29,137 --> 00:40:31,769
probably built up a little bit
of water behind it,

474
00:40:31,793 --> 00:40:34,527
and finally just let loose.

475
00:40:34,551 --> 00:40:36,655
This is the result.

476
00:41:09,517 --> 00:41:11,517
Dustin!
Can you hear me?

477
00:41:14,724 --> 00:41:19,527
I lost comm.
Dustin.

478
00:41:19,551 --> 00:41:21,941
Dustin!

479
00:41:28,793 --> 00:41:30,251
Oh, my.
