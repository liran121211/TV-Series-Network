1
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:10,770
We're trackinga serious storm,

2
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,190
equivalent toa Category 4 hurricane,

3
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,510
that's set to hammerthe Alaskan interior.

4
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,260
The remnants ofTyphoon Merbok,

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,050
moving throughthe Bering Sea,

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,640
are on courseto make landfall

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,120
in the next 24 hours.

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,430
And bring with it

9
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,170
strong winds,rain and snow.

10
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,530
Officials are expectingsevere floods

11
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,130
to hit many partsof Alaska.

12
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:37,570
Apparently, in the forecast

13
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,360
this is supposed to be
a five to 10 year event.

14
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,050
So, basically, it's
batten down the hatches

15
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,260
for the worst?

16
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,740
Yeah. That's what
they're calling for

17
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,050
in the next couple days.

18
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,100
It's that bad, huh?
- It's gonna be bad.

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,530
It rained all night.

20
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,740
- Real hard this morning.
- Yeah, it did.

21
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,750
I'm so
sick of this .

22
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,460
I can't tell what
this rain did to the creek.

23
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,950
So, we're about to go find out
what happened at the creek,

24
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,330
and what
happened to our stuff.

25
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,290
If it's flooding,
if we can dive,

26
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:06,770
if we can still
work in this stuff.

27
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,880
It doesn't seem like it.

28
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,360
We've got a weather
pattern coming so,

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,910
is it really feasible
to try to dredge today?

30
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,170
Well, what if this
is the last day
that we can dredge?

31
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,430
So, I say get in the water,

32
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:19,950
even if it's only
half a day.

33
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,740
Then you better hit it
while you can.

34
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,950
But we know we have
more rain coming,

35
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,570
so were gonna have to
pull the dredges up.

36
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:26,950
Yeah,
we're on the gold.

37
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,220
Snow's obviously
almost here,

38
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,640
and pushing us
out the door.

39
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,710
And we're on the verge.

40
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,120
We're about
to get caught out,

41
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,430
but I don't know
what to do, so...

42
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,430
Probably the foolish thing
to keep trying to get gold.

43
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,950
So, watch yourself out there.

44
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,570
Let's go find out
what it looks like.

45
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:41,330
See if we can
work there or not.

46
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,150
I don't know how
we would recover

47
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:47,050
from another wet storm
like we had before,

48
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,840
and they say it's
gonna be worse.

49
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,750
I just don't know
what to do.

50
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,430
If it rains too much,

51
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,000
it's gonna put us
out of business.

52
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,360
A massive storm

53
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,510
could end theirrecent run of luck.

54
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,430
I'm seeing gold!

55
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,050
For three weeks in a row...

56
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,120
- I knew
there was gold in here!

57
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,400
...both crews havebeen on a pay streak.

58
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,710
Right now, we're on gold.

59
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,360
We're finally starting
to see good gold.

60
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,260
Look at that!
Whoo, doggy!

61
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,020
Everyday we're getting gold,
so that's a great thing.

62
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,430
Pulling up nuggets...

63
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,220
There's a lot
of gold in here.

64
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,220
You knowwe're on a pay streak

65
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,150
when you still get
gold on a bad dive.

66
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,330
- We're getting it guys.
- Yeah.

67
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,430
- This is starting to
get exciting now.

68
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,570
And last weekthere was clear evidence...

69
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,880
Today was the most
gold that we've found so far.

70
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,770
...they're about to hitlife-changing gold.

71
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:39,980
We're on
the gold streak.

72
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,290
Like a little plunge pool,

73
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,020
and all that gold will be
lodged in those boulders.

74
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,510
This could be
our best season ever.

75
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:46,460
There's some hope.

76
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,260
This is going to
inspire everybody.

77
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,960
We're gonna get more gold
than we ever  thought.

78
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,790
If theycan keep dredging.

79
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,770
Holy , man.

80
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,740
Did it rain here?

81
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,270
Yeah. We were
expecting a flood
and we got no water.

82
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,570
I was not expecting this,

83
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,400
it rained all night.

84
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,810
and it must be mostly
snow up to the top,

85
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,910
'cause the water,
not only is it crystal clear,

86
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:11,820
it's low.

87
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:17,670
I expected this to be in,
uh, complete shambles.

88
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,740
I don't know what
the right move is.

89
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:23,000
This is like the best
dive days I've seen ever.

90
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,050
This is like
picture perfect right now.

91
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,020
We're on gold, we wanna
keep dredging,

92
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,680
but we can't afford to lose
all of our stuff either.

93
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,260
Are you
gonna sleep worse,

94
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,810
knowing that you missed out
on a good dive day,

95
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,360
having your  packed up,

96
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,400
or sleep better,

97
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,770
you had a good dive day,
couple of ounces of gold,

98
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:45,930
and nothing packed up?

99
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,310
What's the lesser
of the two evils?

100
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,400
I don't think
we have a choice,
but to dive.

101
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,580
I say we should do this.

102
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,150
I don't think it's
the right thing to do.

103
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,910
I think it's what
I want to do.

104
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,270
- We're gonna look for gold.
- All right.
I'm all with it, man.

105
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,750
I'mma dive.

106
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,150
The responsible
thing right now,

107
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,640
would be to pack this
place up right here,

108
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,000
and go pack up camp.

109
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,130
Do I do the responsible thing?

110
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,410
Or do I try to find gold?

111
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,460
Obviously,
I'm putting on my dive suit.

112
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,580
and, uh, not doing
the responsible thing.

113
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,500
Hopefully...

114
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,050
I can get us down
to the bottom of this thing.

115
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,670
I believe that Nugget Creek

116
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,740
still has a huge payload,

117
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,510
and I'm gonna keepdigging until I find it.

118
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,190
I'm gonna dig
as deep as I can.

119
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,150
Tell my guys
never to do it, but...

120
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,150
I dig straight down.

121
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,330
With a stormbearing down,

122
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,810
and only days left

123
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,640
before the Alaskan winterforces them out,

124
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,670
Dustin Hurt and his crew

125
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,680
are throwingcaution to the wind.

126
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,710
So, you guys
wanna just go that way.

127
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,150
One right here is
your deepest point, man.

128
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,740
Go suck that out.
There's a lot of
gold down there.

129
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,060
- All right.
- A lot of
rock moving.

130
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,020
It's probably
filled in right now,

131
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:21,960
but with gold.

132
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,710
Beneath the unstable

133
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,440
50-ton granite boulder,

134
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,130
they've discovereda rust-colored pay layer.

135
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,880
Now, if Dustincan clear the rocks,

136
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,030
and punch through,

137
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,910
he could hita massive pile

138
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,810
of the legendaryfour ounce chunks

139
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,930
that gaveNugget Creek its name.

140
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,050
I'm happy that
Dustin's getting in.

141
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,080
because ever day could be
one of our last dives.

142
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,600
Mother Nature's, uh,
rearing her head,

143
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,000
saying, "Winter's
coming early."

144
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,360
Everything good?

145
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,910
- All good?Have a good dive, man.

146
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,060
All right.Let's rock and roll.

147
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,200
Hello, old friend.

148
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,770
Let's see if Ican find some gold.

149
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,100
All right. I'm gonnaneed a basket.

150
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,600
It's a double-edged sword
we've got going on right now.

151
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,050
Do we keep trying
to find gold?

152
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,810
Or do we secure
our stuff at camp?

153
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,190
Water's down and clear.

154
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,710
We're gonna take
a chance today.

155
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:31,570
Man, there could be
a bonanza sitting right there.

156
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,120
We're gonna push it
to the limits now.

157
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,860
It's, uh, now or never.

158
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,770
Feel a bit jealous that
I'm not diving right now.

159
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,880
That water's so
dang clear.

160
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,570
There is big gold in there.
I know that for a fact.

161
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,910
He might be able
to actually see gold,

162
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,200
pick it out like we
used to back in
the old days, you know?

163
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,980
Start to take this out.

164
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,400
Missed thisman.

165
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:55,890
I missed diving.

166
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,680
I hope there's a lotof gold down here.

167
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,410
That's gotta be the clearest
I've seen the water yet.

168
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:18,150
I don't wanna be
a Debbie Downer,

169
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:21,190
but if this weather system
is as bad as they're
calling for,

170
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:24,570
there's a chance that today
might be the last dive.

171
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,050
I just want
a successful dive today

172
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,570
and get as much as we can.

173
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,810
With the way that this
weather forecast is looking,

174
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,840
I think I'm gonna
get in the water.

175
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,260
Only because if
it's the last dive

176
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,820
- I need a much material
moved as possible.
- Yeah.

177
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:38,910
So, it
needs to be a fast,

178
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,670
one-and-done type of thing.

179
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,740
Okay.

180
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,080
Work on getting
that other dredge

181
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,330
taken apart and pulled up.

182
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:45,910
We can
definitely do that.

183
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,880
But that way we're still
moving material,

184
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,460
making progress, but...

185
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,060
- we won't get caught
if the water starts coming up.
- No, I agree.

186
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,360
How's it going, Fred?

187
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,910
I'm gonna have these guys
start breaking down

188
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,220
the other dredge.

189
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,020
Get you with, uh, working
on the winch remotes.

190
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,500
- Yeah. All right.
- All right.

191
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,150
- So, everyone knows
what they're doing?
- Yup.

192
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,360
- We got a game plan in place?
- Yup.

193
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,410
Let's get it.

194
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,600
I'm gonna try to get
as much material

195
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,460
moved as possible
in a short amount of time,

196
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,150
'cause this very well
could be the last day

197
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,640
that we get to dredge
this season.

198
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,810
So, we need to make
the most of it, really.

199
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:21,240
Hopefully, there will
be a lot bigger gold
at the bottom.

200
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,220
Two days ago,

201
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,980
at 10 feet down,

202
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,120
Paul discovereda plunge pool,

203
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,860
that could holdthe deepest pointin the creek.

204
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,260
In just minutes,

205
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,740
he dredged up theirbest gold of the season.

206
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,840
Now, if Kaylacan remove the lastrocks from the bottom

207
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,120
and get to the lowest point,

208
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,500
there should bea golden payday

209
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,440
for the taking.

210
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,050
The pressure is
definitely on.

211
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,980
We definitely don't have
enough gold to show

212
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,710
for all of the hard work
that we've put in.

213
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,200
Hopefully, today
will change that.

214
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,840
Well, I wish her
a good day of, uh,

215
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,080
dredging today.

216
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,640
Hopefully uneventful.

217
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,220
Other than get some gold.

218
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,020
Hopefully at the event
happens at the end

219
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,750
when we all look
at the sluice box and...

220
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,460
- that's the event I want.

221
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,410
All right. You're good.Good luck.

222
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,810
Kayla is one of
the best divers we have.

223
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,530
So, we figured, get her in,

224
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,770
she's dredging that
nice, little plunge pool.

225
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,510
This could be one
hell of a gold cache.

226
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,050
Where should we start
breaking this down?

227
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,400
We'll pull
the sluice box out.

228
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,570
We'll take the engines off.

229
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:41,880
Anything that's
heavy on this dredge,

230
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,600
if we can get it off
and get it up there,

231
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,400
and then we're just down
to a frame with some floats.

232
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,340
That's gonna make it easier
trying to pick it up and out.

233
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,880
Oh, yeah.
There we go.

234
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,260
Man that was
wedged in there good.

235
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,790
Now that's a true Alaskan.

236
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,260
Short-sleeved shirt.

237
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:04,020
It's 38 degrees
out here and raining.

238
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,710
Justin's
gotta be awful tough

239
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:09,860
to do that, that's all
I got to say.

240
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,200
There's some rustystuff down here.

241
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,460
That's a good sign.

242
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,480
That's where all the gold is,in that rusty layer.

243
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,580
Hey, guys. I see a piece of gold in the bottom.

244
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,120
There's a crackin the bedrock

245
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,880
and can I seea piece of gold.

246
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,770
Seriously?

247
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,880
There'sa crack in the bedrock.

248
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,840
and I can see a nicepicker laying in it.

249
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,190
- Whoo!Nice.

250
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,340
Dig it out.Dig it out!

251
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,410
Hey guys,I see a piece of goldin the bottom.

252
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,500
There's a crackin the bedrock.

253
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,710
and I can see a nicepicker laying in it.

254
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,150
With a typhoonthreatening to wreak havoc

255
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,220
on southeast Alaska,

256
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,260
Kayla is running out of time

257
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,980
to uncover the big gold

258
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,810
Nugget Creek was named for.

259
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,460
So far, Kayla's diveis going pretty well.

260
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,510
She's kicking ass today,holy.

261
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,220
We know we've got
rain coming, but...

262
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,740
this is the start of it.

263
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,460
I just want the rain
to hold off for today

264
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,770
so we can finish this dive,
get to the bottom,

265
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:33,510
and, uh, see if we can
get a lot more gold.

266
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,980
The good news is

267
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,500
I went in that bedrockstraight down, but...

268
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,510
bad news I can't see anything.

269
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,220
Down creek,

270
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,950
Dustin is diving blind

271
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,680
beneath a 50-ton boulder.

272
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:59,080
His mission,remove the rocks

273
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,860
that stand in the wayof the bedrock gold.

274
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,950
Sorry,there's a rock right here

275
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,270
that is just notgonna give its way.

276
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,840
Carlos, can you grab mea choker, please?

277
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,400
Hell yeah!

278
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:14,740
I bet there'sgold down here

279
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,340
at the bottomof this damn hole.

280
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,440
Oh, there's some
gold right there! Gold!

281
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,910
There's gold inthe box already.

282
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,770
Go. Whatever you're doing,just keep doing it.

283
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,770
So, we aregetting gold, huh?

284
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,290
See a little something?

285
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:30,880
Yup. Alreadygot gold in the box,

286
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,190
that'sawesome, dude.

287
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,310
Good job!

288
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:38,810
Getting gold!

289
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,460
I have a good feeling
about, uh,

290
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,020
how much gold we're
gonna have in the box

291
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,570
at the end of the day.

292
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,750
Yeah, if he can get
deep enough, for sure,
hopefully.

293
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,170
There's a wholebunch of gold down here.

294
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,460
Can take any more of it.

295
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,200
This is a pile of rocks.

296
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,100
I'd love to get out of here.

297
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,460
You all right?

298
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,190
I justneed a second.

299
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,710
Scratched my hand.

300
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,460
Wow. That was something.

301
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,190
My thumb is destroyed, dude.

302
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,360
He  smashed it
between the rock

303
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,530
and the
edge of the dill

304
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,340
That  got him hard.
I just saw it.

305
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,240
That's a heavy
he just had right there.

306
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,710
That was something.

307
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,000
Yeah. There's anothergigantic boulder down there.

308
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,050
Imagine what's under these.

309
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,640
I wonder if these are
sitting on bedrock.

310
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,840
I think right here is
the deepest spot, right here.

311
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,880
All is takes is
that deep hole pocket.

312
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,570
- That's it.
- That's all it takes.

313
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:49,770
A coffee can full of nuggets

314
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,750
- is a lot of gold.
- Absolutely.

315
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:55,400
All right.Hopefully I got it.

316
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:57,050
Come on, baby.

317
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,220
Whoo!

318
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,330
Look at that boulder,
you see how red it is?

319
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,400
Oh, yeah.That rusty stuff?

320
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,400
That last
foot and a half of that

321
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,770
is supposed to
be full of gold.

322
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,430
Ooh!

323
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,400
Oh, my...

324
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,740
Can, uh...
think it'll pull up?

325
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,840
Woo-hoo!

326
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,670
Oh, mystill on.

327
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,460
See that?

328
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,910
- Lookat that.

329
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,430
- What.
- Dude, thatlooked likegold.

330
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:28,360
- Oh!
- Yeah,look at that.

331
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,330
I can't believe that held.

332
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:34,340
Look at it. That does notlook like it should've held.

333
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,670
If that boulder
was sitting on bedrock,

334
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,530
there should be
some nice gold.

335
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:39,810
The gold would be visible

336
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:42,650
if it was not encased
in all the orange rust.

337
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,670
I got all the bigboulders out, finally.

338
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,330
Now I've got bedrock

339
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:50,130
all the way to thisbig rock right here.

340
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,220
It's just oneboulder after another.

341
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,670
And they keep getting
larger as we go, so...

342
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,640
Sooner or later we
get under the right boulder,

343
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,650
that's just gonna have
a lot of gold there.

344
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,290
Ah! All right.

345
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:14,640
Pull up on the basket, please.

346
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,620
Up and out.

347
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,360
Up creek,Kayla inches closer

348
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,480
to bedrock.

349
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,400
That wason the very bottom.

350
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:27,840
Where you left off, Paul.

351
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:28,890
Oh, wow.

352
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,190
It waswedged in there.

353
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,720
That thing wasato get out.

354
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:38,050
Kayla's down there
moving them big ole rocks,

355
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,080
that, uh, 200 pound guys,

356
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,530
picking up and moving around,

357
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,710
just grabbing them
and moving them around
and, uh...

358
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,840
underwater, uh,
she's moving them up.

359
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,100
and getting them
into the basket.

360
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,580
Good for her.

361
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,950
You got somereally nice materialcoming through.

362
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,020
You know, it'sreally rusty down there.

363
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,190
That's whatwe're looking for.

364
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,500
Red-cloudedmyself out.

365
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,570
Lots of rust down here.

366
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,960
Hopefully there'sa good amountof gold in that material.

367
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,910
Four hours in,

368
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,120
Kayla has hit 13 feet,

369
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,860
the deepest point yetin the plunge pool.

370
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,640
I was under mine,some of the big rocks,

371
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,400
now, it's kindatunneled, so...

372
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,950
I'm running out ofmaterial I can work.

373
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,270
Pretty insane.

374
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,330
Kayla's desperate bid

375
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:29,220
to tunnel verticallydown to bedrock,

376
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,480
has left widowmakershanging up above.

377
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,810
Before they cango any deeper,

378
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:37,550
they'll need to widenthe mouth of the dive hole.

379
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:43,360
All righty.I'm gonna put this...

380
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,670
hose up and I'mgonna come up.

381
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,500
Copy that.

382
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,430
Nozzle is hooked.

383
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,340
Coming up.

384
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,530
I ran out ofmaterial to work.

385
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,430
without going fromthe top and expanding

386
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,880
and then coming back down.

387
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,570
I got some more depth though.

388
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:00,460
Good deal.

389
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,910
That's badass you saw
a piece of gold down there.

390
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,120
I like that.

391
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,480
The prettiest sight
would be some gold in the box.

392
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,880
How'd you make out?

393
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,360
- That's the piece I saw
in the bottom.
- There you go.

394
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,260
- Nice.
- There's some
pieces right there.

395
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,570
Yeah.

396
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,640
That the one
y'all saw earlier?

397
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,980
- Yeah.
- Ah, no .

398
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,740
- It was
stuck in a crack.
- Damn.

399
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,120
- There's a bunch of
other little pieces in there.
- Yeah there's a...

400
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,840
- a bunch right here.
- Quite a few of them.

401
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,810
There's one.
There's a bunch
of small stuff.

402
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:28,810
There's some
in the corner.

403
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,460
There's a bunch
stuck up here.

404
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,810
Looking pretty good.
Looking pretty good.

405
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,840
Still have to look and see
what's in the fines.

406
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:35,790
The big stuff.

407
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,430
Really good.

408
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,670
If it stays like this
and that moisture river

409
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,710
just dumps a bunch
of snow upstream,

410
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,640
I think we'll get a few
more days of dredging.

411
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,370
And all that gold will be
locked in that plunge pool.

412
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,430
That would be nice.

413
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:49,640
I gotta get changed.

414
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,220
- 'Cause I'm cold.
- Yeah,
you get warmed up.

415
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,550
- I'm frozen.
- You put in
a good dive today.

416
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:57,150
Everybody was expecting
this to be flooded today.

417
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,640
But, uh, got some
dredging done.

418
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,640
picked up some gold.

419
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,100
And, uh, I think everybody's
pretty happy with it.

420
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,740
Tried to clean up
as much material

421
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,020
as possible today.

422
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,020
Hopefully,
the weather holds out.

423
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,600
The last thing
we need right now

424
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,500
is a huge flood.

425
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,340
We're preparing for the worst,
but hoping for the best.

426
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,050
Looks like they're
getting it ready to

427
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,840
haul it up the hill here.

428
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,460
I think
between the three of us

429
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,440
we should be able to
walk it over there.

430
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,220
Well, it's
definitely a good idea

431
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,530
to, uh, do a little
preventive maintenance.

432
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,640
Rather than coming out here
and doing a rescue mission.

433
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,810
That's so much
easier without those
side pontoons.

434
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:40,770
Oh, my .
That made
a world of difference.

435
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:42,150
- That should be good.
- Yup.

436
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,670
- Looking good.

437
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:46,640
Now tie off
every rope we got.

438
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,460
Everything's safe
and sound now, huh?

439
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,980
I think so.

440
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,190
- Good.
- I think we're
in good shape now.

441
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:54,360
We got both the dredges
pulled up and out,

442
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,950
just in case it floods.

443
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,430
Hopefully,
in the next day or so

444
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,840
once this storm passes,

445
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,150
we'll be able to
get back to work,

446
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,200
get back in the water,
and get back on the gold.

447
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,890
Up ahead...

448
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,890
That is some fast
moving water, man.

449
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,840
I finally realized

450
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,460
y'all are tougher than I am.

451
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,020
Is that all gold?

452
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,410
- There's gold.
- Whoo-hoo!

453
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,620
It's definitely
cold now.

454
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:42,220
Do we have enough time
to get to this point?

455
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,190
That is the question.

456
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,980
I don't know.

457
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,400
It's not that we're
not willing to do so,

458
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,950
it's all about what
Alaska will let us do.

459
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,720
We're fighting against
Alaska right now.

460
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,400
Mining 8 feet

461
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,530
beneath a 50-ton boulder,

462
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,640
Dustin is racing toput gold in the box

463
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,860
before a giant storm hits.

464
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:07,060
I cleaned off6 feet worth of bedrock

465
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,530
And I got this wall,until about here,completely cleaned.

466
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,270
It just goes down right here.

467
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,770
But I can't getunderneath this

468
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,290
big, giant rock right here.

469
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,020
It has to go away.

470
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,530
In order to continue,that rock has to move,

471
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:24,260
and we don't have time...

472
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,500
there's a storm coming.

473
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,890
It's time for meto get out of here.

474
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,740
Dustinwill need to blast

475
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,150
the large boulder.

476
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,810
But an explosionthis close to the...

477
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:38,190
to the 50 ton monstercould cause it to crash downinto their dive hole,

478
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:40,960
ending their season for good.

479
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,750
Good dive.
Good, good,
good dive.

480
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:52,810
Cleaned up under a whole
bunch of really big rocks,
all on bedrock.

481
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:56,460
So, if there's going to be
gold, it should be there.

482
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:00,020
Time to clean the dredge,
get all the mats out,

483
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,330
clean the box,
take it back to camp.

484
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:03,480
See what we got.

485
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,670
Dustin definitely moved
some frickin' big rocks.

486
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:11,570
So, if we get rid of this
big, big one right here,

487
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,710
and we're getting closer
and closer to the middle,

488
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:17,670
which I think is the deepest
point of this pool.

489
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:22,310
We're getting there.
We're getting there, actually
pretty quicker than I thought.

490
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,220
Oh, look at that.
Was that all gold?

491
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,150
That is gold.

492
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:35,330
Looks like about
an ounce or so a day,
maybe two,

493
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:39,710
if we can just continue
on with that, that's a great
haul.

494
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:43,640
There's still huge payload
down there, but we're
running out of time.

495
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,720
We're about to get really
hammered with some
water apparently.

496
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,980
I think we should prepare
for a flood.

497
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,430
- With any luck, it's just
snow on top.
- Yeah.

498
00:21:56,630 --> 00:22:01,980
- But, if it doesn't rain,
storm is gonna wipe us out.
- Yeah.

499
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:05,080
- If we leave it in
a precarious situation.
- Mm-hmm.

500
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,000
- The dredge isn't safe.
- Okay.

501
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:12,400
I'm just trying to secure
the dredge as best I can

502
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,360
if we've got a flood comin'.

503
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,740
We don't really have
a way to pick it all
the way out.

504
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,400
So I'm just trying
to secure it, pick it up
the best I can

505
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:22,050
and hope for the best.

506
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:25,670
Both Kaylaand Dustin are onthe verge of unearthing

507
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,840
Nugget Creek's gold.

508
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,290
Just one more day of miningcould be all they need

509
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:34,460
to have the seasonof a lifetime.

510
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:38,050
We got another flood comin',
it's supposed to be
the biggest one of all of 'em.

511
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,910
So, trying to imagine
what's about to happen.

512
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:44,880
What is this place gonna
look like after the biggest
flood I've ever seen

513
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,840
comes through here?

514
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,330
Getting ready for the worst,
wrapping up my winches.

515
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:51,840
We can't afford to lose any
of the equipment.

516
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,840
It's .
It's... it's all the gears,
man...

517
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,340
- Yeah.
- ...that has to get
wrapped up, man.

518
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,270
That's good
right there, man.

519
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,080
That looks great.
I like the way it looks.

520
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,790
Okay, sounds good.

521
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,400
Are you ready?

522
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:17,050
Well, it looks like
our site's buttoned up,
ready for the worst,

523
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:20,260
the storm. Hopefully,
they are wrong about
what's coming in.

524
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,600
The weather, we don't
need it right now.

525
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,640
We do not need
another flood taking away
all of our stuff.

526
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,370
It's all buttoned up,
so hopefully we're good

527
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:48,880
I'll make a toast to you guys.
It has been a good time.
And I finally realized

528
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:53,770
- y'all are tougher than
I am.

529
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:56,910
Now, if you take my
direction you're gonna
get a lot of gold.

530
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:59,950
- It's about 20 feet from
where you're working.
- Wherever I'm digging.

531
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:02,020
- 20 feet away. Got it.

532
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,500
Appreciate your help,
Fred.

533
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,710
Y'all got one hell
of a storm coming
in here, soon.

534
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,500
There's a big storm
comin' right now.

535
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,330
- Huge.
- It's either gonna drop snow
or a ton of rain.

536
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:14,400
We'll see what happens.

537
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,190
Well, I got to catch
a plane.

538
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:20,710
This is not the best weather
for this, but we got to get
you back to town, Fred.

539
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:24,880
Again, thanks everybody.
I appreciate it.

540
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,720
All right, let's get down
to the boat, get it ready
to go.

541
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,750
Dustin, we're about ready
to go.

542
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,640
I think we're ready to rock.

543
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,460
You gotta get the hell
out of here.

544
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,030
That river don't look friendly
out there at all.

545
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,580
Have a safe trip, Fred.

546
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,500
We're waking up to reportsof flash flooding

547
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:43,120
and mudslides, as the effectsof Typhoon Merbok continueto hammer parts of Alaska.

548
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,120
The highest rainfallfor 50 years has beenrecorded

549
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,710
and a red weather warningremains in place for manyparts of the state.

550
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:54,840
Officials are recommendingall residents remain indoorsuntil the storm passes

551
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,770
It's been raining since
midnight, that's a lot of rain
in a short amount of time.

552
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:01,020
All that snow that was
up there is...

553
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:05,500
...is now melted too,
so that three inches of rain
plus all that snow melt.

554
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:09,670
A series of stormshas made the past six monthsthe wettest

555
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,620
in Alaska's recorded history.

556
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:17,360
Now, just as both crewsare back on the gold,

557
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:21,460
a monster typhoon hasdevastated Nugget Creek.

558
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,640
We've had multiple instances
of rain overnight,

559
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,770
so we're fixing to
head up to our site.

560
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:28,740
Only Paul, Kayla
and myself are here,

561
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,770
the rest of the guys,
we kind of split up

562
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:34,500
so they would only have
to make one boat ride
into town get supplies.

563
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,190
I'm not sure if they can
get back today.

564
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:38,840
So we're stuck out here
with just the three of us
to go to our site

565
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,880
and see what's going on.

566
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,050
All those boulders
get in our hole,
there's just...

567
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:45,190
- There's nothing--
- There's no time to get
them back out.

568
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:49,600
No, that would just be
stupidity to try to start
over again.

569
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,530
- Insanity.
- Stupidity at this point.

570
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:53,890
All right, let's get out
of here.

571
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,120
We're gotta go up there
and see what that boulder
we've got...

572
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,950
that Fred tied off for us did.

573
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,330
Yup.

574
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:05,750
With this kind of
, I could see it
washing that out.

575
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,980
We thought
that last flood was bad.

576
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:15,020
I think
this season's over.
Holy .

577
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,930
And that
is hauling ass.

578
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,530
Hear the boulders?

579
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:22,400
That's so
loud.

580
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:29,170
Holy crap. That's .

581
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,400
That's insane.

582
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:03,080
This is way worse
than that other flood.

583
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,460
Way worse.

584
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:10,120
In southeastAlaska, the remainsof a coastal typhoon

585
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,950
have slammed intoNugget Creek,

586
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:16,860
dropping over three inchesof rain in under 12 hours.

587
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,550
The first one
was bad but this one's
terrible.

588
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:35,890
When we finally
started getting on some gold,
now this.

589
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,740
I mean, you could hear
the boulders rolling down
the creek,

590
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:47,580
sounds like thunder,
sounds like I'm in a Texas
thunderstorm right now.

591
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:02,120
See all that
falling.

592
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,580
Rock slide
over there,
see it coming down.

593
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,950
That's crazy. Damn.

594
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:12,980
For 10 years I've been
up there I've never seen this.

595
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:17,000
No, no, no. There's not
a  thing we can
do here.

596
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,930
The power of this water
is just insane,

597
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,050
It'd be suicide to be
in the water right now.
You'd just get...

598
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,930
You'd get pulverized.

599
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:38,190
It'd eat you alive.

600
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:41,150
The thought of getting
in that water doesn't even
cross my mind.

601
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:45,510
No. I know, one wrong step
right now and you end up
in there, you're done.

602
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,370
This is a freaking
nightmare.

603
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:00,740
So I wonder what we can see
if we can at least get around
the corner and look

604
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,020
- up to where's your site,
- We can go look.

605
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,770
- Wanna look around
the corner?
- Yeah.

606
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:05,200
I'm going down.

607
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,740
Our
walk way is washed out.

608
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:13,150
I think it's safe to say
we are going to our site,

609
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,600
No.

610
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,570
So, either way, Mother
Nature always gives us
an end,

611
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:21,050
she either gives us gold,
or gives us .

612
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:25,670
This year, it's just a lot
of hard work and .

613
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:29,150
We can't even
get out to the dredge,

614
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:32,120
I hate to say it but I think
this is it.

615
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,190
I think this is the end.

616
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:37,130
I don't think there's any
coming back from this one.

617
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,000
Not this one.

618
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:45,510
I mean, all we can do
is just sit back and wait.

619
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:49,860
That sounds like
that just picked up in
intensity.

620
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,950
Let's get out here.

621
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:55,190
- Yeah, let's get off
this walk way.
- Yeah, let's go.

622
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:56,130
Let's get out of here.

623
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:05,360
This is tragic right
now. I mean, we are so
close to this large gold.

624
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,600
We thought we had figured
out how to mine this,

625
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:12,270
this creek, but Mother Nature
has shown us a different story
this year.

626
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:16,650
We can't even get to our site.

627
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:20,260
Right now it's a waiting game.

628
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:24,170
We just gotta let it run
its course and then check
the carnage afterwards.

629
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,330
- Let's get the hell
outta here.
- Get outta here.

630
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:32,100
All that  washing
away, there's nothing
we can do.

631
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:37,430
Well, that's depressing
as .

632
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,620
Seems like a good
day to just start drinking.

633
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:53,430
Holy .

634
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:56,650
- That's scary,
wild man.

635
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:58,220
Woah!

636
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:02,150
That is some
fast moving water, man.

637
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:04,510
- Is he gonna make it?
- man,
I hope so.

638
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,130
Holy crap.

639
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:11,570
Almost there.

640
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:13,860
- Yeah, buddy,
- That's what I'm talkin'
about.

641
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:21,220
- We made it.
- How many times did
you think you were gonna die?

642
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,400
Holy

643
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:25,220
Yeah,
that just happened.

644
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,600
Did all that just happen?

645
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,260
Are we still alive?
Am I dead?

646
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:31,840
I was hoping this thing
wouldn't freakin' lose power,
man.

647
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,290
Good driving, dude.

648
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:36,980
I just felt like a point where
I wasn't moving anymore.

649
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,330
Thank god that's over man.

650
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:42,020
Dude, that's scary water,
man.

651
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,810
I took it as easy
as I could now.

652
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:47,580
That is some scary
water, man.

653
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:51,430
That's going there,
what's happening here?

654
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:52,530
Ah, I'd agree.

655
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:54,270
Let's get to the site,
see what we got.

656
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:05,430
The current is ripping.

657
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:06,840
Gonna chew it out, bud.

658
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,190
Okay.

659
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:11,430
Torrential rainshave rerouted Nugget Creek

660
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:16,290
and washed out the ATV trailstranding the Whitewaterfilm crew.

661
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:19,120
- What are you doing,
.
- A little bump in the middle.

662
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,460
Yeah.

663
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,020
You wanna try and wheel it?

664
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,550
Yeah, as long as you have
two wheels on the dirt.

665
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,890
All right,
you guys ready?
Hang on tight.

666
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,460
Woo-hoo. Hello country.

667
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,000
All right.

668
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:39,680
Let's see what
those minors are up to.

669
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:49,460
About time you showed up.

670
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,980
You guys go look
at the site?
How's it look?

671
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,360
It's .

672
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,260
The dredges, got rocks
in front of it, it's got rocks
behind it,

673
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,430
the waters by shooting
six feet over the bridge.

674
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:00,500
I don't even think
the upstream winch is there.

675
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,770
That  is devastated,
dude, I think this is going
to be the end of our season.

676
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,680
I don't think we're coming
back from this

677
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,530
Did your equipment
make it?

678
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:14,360
We can't even get to our
site right now, that water's
raging so much,

679
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,570
it's over our walkway,
it doesn't look good.

680
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:18,770
Our dredges should be safe.
We got them up and out
of the water

681
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:21,030
but I don't think
anything else is gonna
survive that.

682
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,500
So what you're
saying is we're done.

683
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:29,220
I don't see a recovery
from this.

684
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:34,220
Dustin's investedeverything he owns to buythe claims at Nugget Creek.

685
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:39,640
Now, the worst typhoon to hit Alaska in over 50 years

686
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,770
threatens to bankrupt him.

687
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:44,150
I've been coming up
for almost 10 years

688
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:46,050
and I've never seen
anything like this.

689
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,710
- I have to wrap
my head around this.
- Yeah.

690
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:49,100
- I just, I, uh...
- It's devastating.

691
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:54,750
I'm freaking out a little
bit right now, yo.

692
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,270
Freakin' out.

693
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:04,400
All right, let's get up
the hill, I'll start assessing
what the problem is.

694
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,220
All right.

695
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,440
- Dammit.

696
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:21,410
Did we lose all that
damn gear?

697
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,910
Let's hope not, man.

698
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:25,670
I feel like I failed y'all.

699
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,960
No one can prepare
for something like this, dude,
no one can.

700
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,790
Freakin' out a little bit.

701
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:39,950
We only literally have
a couple of weeks
at the most left,

702
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:43,860
all this pain and crazy rain
is just frickin' unbelievable,
man.

703
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:49,080
I took Fred back
so he can catch his flight,
and overnight

704
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,190
it rained three or four
inches apparently.

705
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:54,980
And it sounds like
everything is devastated.

706
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:58,650
The site's gone.
The roads are gone.

707
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,580
The creek is over its...

708
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,930
... sides.

709
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:09,930
Sounds like we lost
everything and everything's
over.

710
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,640
- I'm freaking out right now.
- I know, I know
you are.

711
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,500
I'm trying to calm
myself down.

712
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:22,150
And the only way I know
how to do that is to go
get my eyes on everything,

713
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:25,620
and go find out
what is the deal.

714
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:36,480
you. Let me go.

715
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,460
No frickin' way.

716
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:45,150
Wow. Dude,
you see that road?

717
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:48,080
- yeah, I do.
- It's a
river now.

718
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,640
- This looks pretty bad.
- I don't know what to think,
I don't know what to do.

719
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,910
I'm doing
the only think I know
what to know,

720
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:57,000
charge at it and see
what happens.

721
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,020
Holy cow!

722
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,770
That's not
a creek anymore.

723
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,000
That's a river.

724
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,640
Holy .

725
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,720
Get the
outta here.

726
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:25,740
Holy .
This is scary.

727
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,820
Lotta hate, lotta destruction.

728
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:34,000
You'd not have known
that yesterday we were
diving in his water.

729
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,440
This is a nightmare.

730
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:41,340
It's beyond anything
I thought was possible
here.

731
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:47,950
Surging at speedsof over nine feet per second,

732
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:53,080
Nugget Creek is capableof hurling 100 poundboulders into the dive holes

733
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,200
they've spent weeksdigging out.

734
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:02,460
All our hard work just
flushed down the toilet,

735
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:07,130
just when we're starting
to see frickin' gold in
the box.

736
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:09,570
This is crazy.

737
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:12,020
I've never seen
a flood this bad.

738
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:14,840
I don't know how
we're gonna come back
on this one.

739
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,080
How is that board
sitting there like that?

740
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,960
- The walkway-- Yeah.
- The walkway got ripped
apart.

741
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:23,500
Looks like the winch
is half gone.

742
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,430
I hope everything
didn't get destroyed.

743
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:29,150
All right guys,
let's see what we can
salvage.

744
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:31,670
Carlos, see if you can find
another rope.

745
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:33,570
and figure out how
to tie that thing off.

746
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:36,950
- Okay, uh...
- Figure something out.

747
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:40,150
Right now it's kind of
a rescue mission.
We need to just try to save

748
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:43,260
everything that we can,
obviously, we won't be
able to save everything,

749
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:46,950
but we need to really
salvage what we can
so that next year

750
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,220
we still have equipment
to use.

751
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,150
- Can you clean that up,
collect the electronics...
- Yeah.

752
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:51,570
- and all that .
- Yeah. Yeah.

753
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:52,910
I gotcha.

754
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:55,290
James,
we should bring that
and tie that up here,

755
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:57,150
and that'll keep that
going forward.

756
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:59,640
Right now, the dredge
is flowin' down the river
so I'm just doing what I can

757
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,170
to try to save our dredge.

758
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:08,020
Uh, we prepared
for the worst, and this is it.

759
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,810
Think we'll be able
to dredge again?

760
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:10,960
I don't know.

761
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:15,080
This is the hardest place
we've ever dug,

762
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,670
this is more than I ever
thought could happen here.

763
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:20,400
And we thought
we were prepared.

764
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:21,460
Yeah.

765
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,220
This makes me very sad.

766
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:27,790
I'm having a hard time
trying to figure out if I
can salvage this.

767
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:31,910
After monthsof backbreaking work,

768
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:36,810
Dustin and his creware on their best goldof the season.

769
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:44,570
Now, he faces his toughestdecision, cut his losses,or attempt a fight back.

770
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:46,530
All right,
now we've got our
dredge secured.

771
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:49,570
Let's say we get
the  outta here before
the side come down on us.

772
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:52,000
I still wanna
dig this, I think we can.

773
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:54,430
I think the dredge
is all right.

774
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:57,020
The mechanical stuff looks
in good shape.

775
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,770
I don't think
we should hang out here.

776
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:00,190
I'd agree.

777
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:03,400
Let's just get out of here
before it's too dangerous
and we die.

778
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:06,980
Come back up and find out
what the devastation
is tomorrow.

779
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,770
What we can salvage.

780
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:12,290
We are so close to this
large gold, we don't want
to leave it till next year.

781
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:14,130
I think we can make it work.

782
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:16,980
There's a lot of devastation.

783
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:21,150
It's a huge flood,
but I think the water
will be down tomorrow.

784
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:24,530
We can find out what
the actual damage is.

785
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:27,120
Just caught me completely
off guard.

786
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,600
I thought we'd have us
a flood, we dig out
the kitty litter

787
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,750
and that'd be the end of it.

788
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,770
We thought we were prepared.

789
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:38,290
I've invested a lot,
this has to pay off.

790
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:40,580
It has to pay or else
I'm gonna going broke.

791
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:42,820
We'll find out tomorrow.

792
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,950
On the seasonfinale ofGold Rush:
White Water...

793
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:56,400
I need one of you
to tell me that we can
dig this.

794
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:57,570
Yeah, we can dig this.

795
00:40:57,770 --> 00:40:59,670
Our walk way is completely
gone.

796
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:02,150
I'm gonna get my waders on
and see if I can find
a way across.

797
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,330
Let's go,
cowboy.

798
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:08,460
So you guys are done?
You're not gonna
dig there anymore?

799
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,640
It'll take us a week
to get setup.

800
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,910
We'll work for you
and give you guys
a hand.

801
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:13,120
It's all hands of deck...

802
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,340
When in doubt,
blow  up.

803
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:17,220
Fire in the hole!

804
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:21,640
That could be where
those big four ounce
nuggets

805
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,770
can be lurking out.

806
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:24,910
This is just the chunky stuff.
It's not all of it.

807
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,290
Holy, that's
good stuff.

808
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:30,770
- Dig a hole, man.
- You can do it,

809
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:31,710
Look out!

810
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:34,330
- Rock...
- Rock, rock, rock...

811
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:35,750
Move, move, move,
move...
