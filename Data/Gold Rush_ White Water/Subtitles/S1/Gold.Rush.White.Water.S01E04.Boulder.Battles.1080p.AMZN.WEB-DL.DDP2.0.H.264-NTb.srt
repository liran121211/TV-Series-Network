IS BURIED DEEP ON THE BEDROCK
BELOW McKINLEY CREEK.

OVER THE LAST 10,000 YEARS,

HAS CARVED THE CREEK

OUT OF THE BEDROCK.

ALONG THE CREEK BED.

IT'S STILL OVERBURDEN.

686
00:38:53,533 --> 00:38:55,533
**

687
00:38:55,567 --> 00:38:56,933
I'LL BE DANGED.

688
00:38:56,967 --> 00:39:00,433
WE COULD GO FOR 3, 4 WEEKS
AND NOT FIND A SPECK OF GOLD.

689
00:39:00,467 --> 00:39:01,867
AND THEN ONE WEEK,
WE COULD COME UP

690
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,833
WITH 50 OUNCES, YOU KNOW?

691
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,200
OH, I HOPE
WE GOT SOME GOLD.

692
00:39:09,233 --> 00:39:12,600
GIVE IT A COUPLE MINUTES HERE
AND SEE WHAT WE END UP WITH.

693
00:39:16,067 --> 00:39:18,733
HOW'S IT LOOKING?

694
00:39:18,767 --> 00:39:20,900
-YEAH, THERE'S GOLD IN IT.
-THERE'S A NICE LITTLE CHUNK.

695
00:39:20,933 --> 00:39:24,067
Wes: THAT'S ACTUALLY
PRETTY GOOD, YOU KNOW.

696
00:39:24,067 --> 00:39:27,400
I'M PRETTY HAPPY WITH, UH,
WHAT I SEE COMING OUT OF HERE.

697
00:39:27,433 --> 00:39:30,233
GET A PAN SO WE CAN GET
THAT STUFF OUT AND SEE.

698
00:39:34,267 --> 00:39:35,867
HEY, FRED.
COME CHECK THIS OUT.

699
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,600
HEY, GUYS.
-WHATCHA GOT?

700
00:39:37,633 --> 00:39:40,833
TAKE A LOOK.

701
00:39:40,867 --> 00:39:42,433
Wes: OH, THAT'S NOT SO BAD
FOR THE HEIGHT

702
00:39:42,467 --> 00:39:44,700
OF THE AREA WE WERE DREDGING.

703
00:39:44,733 --> 00:39:46,700
I MEAN, WHAT'S
THE DEEPEST YOU GOT?

704
00:39:46,733 --> 00:39:49,433
10 FEET.

705
00:39:49,467 --> 00:39:52,533
WE'RE NOT REALLY GONNA KNOW
UNTIL WE CAN GET TO THE BEDROCK.

706
00:39:52,567 --> 00:39:55,867
Fred: I SAY WE JUST STAY ON IT,
KEEP AFTER IT AND, UH,

707
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,333
WE DO THE BEST
WE CAN WITH IT.

708
00:39:57,367 --> 00:39:59,067
WE'RE ACTUALLY JUST GETTING
GOING IN THAT HOLE.

709
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:03,467
-YEP.
-IT -- IT'S THERE. IT'S THERE.

710
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,800
I'M SURE IT IS.

711
00:40:05,833 --> 00:40:08,267
WE HAVEN'T FOUND
THAT POCKET OF GOLD YET.

712
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,500
I'M GONNA BE STILL
LOOKING FOR THAT

713
00:40:09,533 --> 00:40:11,700
VERY DEEPEST PART
OF THAT BEDROCK.

714
00:40:11,733 --> 00:40:14,467
HEY, I'M KIND
OF OLD-SCHOOL.

715
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,933
I KNOW SOMETIMES IT TAKES
A LOT OF WORK, PATIENCE.

716
00:40:17,967 --> 00:40:20,333
BUT IT PAYS OFF IN THE END.

717
00:40:20,367 --> 00:40:21,733
PERSISTENCE, MAN.

718
00:40:21,767 --> 00:40:22,800
PERSISTENCE.

719
00:40:22,833 --> 00:40:26,167
**

720
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,167
Dustin: IT'S A GREAT AREA,
AND IT'S -- THE SIGNS ARE GREAT.

721
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,433
BUT IT'S LIKE A PUZZLE.

722
00:40:35,467 --> 00:40:37,467
WHERE WOULD YOU GO
IF YOU WERE GOLD?

723
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,733
TRY TO THINK LIKE GOLD.
WOULD IT SIT RIGHT HERE?

724
00:40:39,767 --> 00:40:41,467
WOULD IT SIT RIGHT THERE?

725
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,367
WHY THE HELL WOULD YOU SIT
RIGHT THERE AND NOT RIGHT THERE?

726
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,333
THINK MAYBE IF I STARE
AT IT LONG ENOUGH,

727
00:40:46,367 --> 00:40:48,900
I COULD FIGURE IT OUT.

728
00:40:48,933 --> 00:40:50,833
I KNOW THERE'S GOLD THERE.

729
00:40:50,867 --> 00:40:53,400
JUST NEED TO GET DEEPER.

730
00:40:56,467 --> 00:40:57,833
**

731
00:40:57,867 --> 00:41:00,567
Narrator:
ON THE NEXT EPISODE...

732
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:05,633
-ALL RIGHT. HERE WE GO.
-FIND ME SOME GOLD!

733
00:41:05,667 --> 00:41:07,467
Dustin: LANDSLIDE.

734
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,267
IT'S COMPLETELY
ACROSS THE CREEK.

735
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,867
IF IT COMES OVER THE TOP
OF THAT AND BUSTS THROUGH,

736
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,933
IT WILL KICK OUR ASS.

737
00:41:14,967 --> 00:41:17,800
WE COULD GET, UH,
LIKE A TSUNAMI.

738
00:41:17,833 --> 00:41:20,500
THE WATER DROPPED 10 INCHES
IN A COUPLE MINUTES.

739
00:41:20,533 --> 00:41:22,767
THAT MEANS THERE'S A WALL
OF WATER GONNA COME.

740
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,500
WE RUN FOR THE HILLS
AS FAST AS WE CAN.

741
00:41:25,533 --> 00:41:27,067
Carlos:
WE GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE.

742
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:29,800
**

743
00:41:29,833 --> 00:41:32,367
I'M GOING TO GET
MY GOLD THIS WEEKEND.

744
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,333
Man:
YOU MAY KISS YOUR BRIDE.
