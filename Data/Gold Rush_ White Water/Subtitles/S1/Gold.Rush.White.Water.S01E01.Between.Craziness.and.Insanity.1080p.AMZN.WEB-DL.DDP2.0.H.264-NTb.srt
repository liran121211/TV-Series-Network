HAS KEPT OUT

00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,633
HANG ON, MAN. I GOT TO GET
MYSELF DOWN A LITTLE BIT.

118
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:08,300
SOME PEOPLE CALL ME "BIG BOOT,"
'CAUSE I GOT ONE LEG

GET OUT OF THE WAY.

HE'S IN CHARGE.

129
00:06:35,367 --> 00:06:36,967
HE'S GOT HIS WAY
OF TALKING DOWN TO ME.

130
00:06:37,067 --> 00:06:38,500
AND I DON'T THINK
HE MEANS IT.

131

132
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:43,267
IT'S ENOUGH TO SET YOU OFF.

I LOVE HIM.

136
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:52,067

TAKE CARE OF HIM.
