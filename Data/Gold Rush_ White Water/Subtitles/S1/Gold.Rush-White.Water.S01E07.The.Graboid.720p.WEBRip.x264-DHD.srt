00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:17,782
OKAY, COPY THAT.

174
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:24,556
'KAY. I'M SENDING THE, UH,
SHACKLE DOWN TO YOU.

175
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:34,332
Carlos: COME ON, MAN!
THIS'LL WORK!

176
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:36,133
COME ON! COME ON!

177
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,836
ALL RIGHT. TAKE THIS.

178
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:41,906
OKAY.

179
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:44,942
COME ON!

180
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,477
[BLEEP] DAMN IT!

181
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,479
[BLEEP] DAMN IT!

182
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:48,680
[BLEEP]

183
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:50,815
ALL RIGHT, [BLEEP]
THIS [BLEEP].

184
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,684
DONE WITH THIS.

185
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:54,352
IT'S SO BIG
AND SO ROUND,

186
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:57,689
SO SMOOTH THAT IT --
IT'S A PAIN.

187
00:10:57,691 --> 00:10:59,490
IT'S A PAIN BECAUSE
THAT MAKES YOU

188
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,560
JUST WANNA JUST
EITHER GO CRAZY

189
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:04,529
OR JUST END
THE DIVE, YOU KNOW?

190
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:10,902
THAT ONE SINGLE BOULDER
GOT INSIDE MY HEAD.

191
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:12,837
HOW BIG'S THAT [BLEEP], MAN?
'BOUT THAT BIG.

192
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:13,938
THAT BIG?
HOLY [BLEEP]!

193
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:18,143
I LET ONE BOULDER BEAT ME.

194
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:23,682
IT JUST ATE MY BREAKFAST.

195
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,320
Narrator:
IF THEY CAN'T MOVE THE BOULDER,

196
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:31,389
THEY CAN'T GET TO THE GOLD.

197
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,591
WHEW!

198
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:36,461
STAND OVER HERE
FOR A LITTLE BIT.

199
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:38,262
WE GOTTA HAVE SOMETHING
BETTER TO GRAB THEM ROCKS

200
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,530
AND PICK 'EM
AND PULL 'EM OUT.

201
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:43,134
I JUST FEEL LIKE
THIS IS CAVEMAN STUFF.

202
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:45,637
WE GOTTA SET
SOMETHING UP BETTER.

203
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:54,079
TOUGH DAY AT THE OFFICE
WHEN YOU CAN'T MOVE A BOULDER.

204
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:58,750
MY HAND IS ABSOLUTELY NUMB.

205
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:00,151
Fred:
BUT THERE'S A REASONABLE AMOUNT

206
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:02,486
OF TIME YOU CAN SPEND
ON A CERTAIN TASK.

207
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:07,158
WASTED A WHOLE HOUR OF TIME
PULLING ON ONE DAMN ROCK.

208
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,628
I'M RUNNING OUTTA TIME.

209
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,964
WE'VE GOTTA GET
A BETTER SOLUTION FOR THIS.

210
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:16,767
Narrator: UP AHEAD...

211
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:17,769
IT WON'T GO.

212
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:19,703
Dustin:
CLICK ON IT SOME MORE.

213
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:21,372
YEAH. UP.
UP.

214
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,276
[BLEEP]

215
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:49,667
HEY, FELLAS!

216
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:51,002
CHECK IT OUT!
WHAT YOU GOT?

217
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:54,873
I GOT SOME FUN TOYS!

218
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,942
Narrator: DUSTIN HAS RETURNED
FROM TOWN WITH A DEVICE

219
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:01,212
THAT COULD SOLVE
HIS BOULDER PROBLEM.

220
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:02,213
LOOK AT THIS THING.

221
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:03,881
THAT LOOKS PRETTY
GOD DANG NICE.

222
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:06,551
I KNOW MONEY'S TIGHT RIGHT NOW.
BUT I HAD TO DO IT.

223
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:09,354
WE SPENT $3,500
ON THIS ROCK LIFT.

224
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:11,289
AND, UH, I THINK
WHAT IT'S GONNA DO

225
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,425
IS IT'S GONNA SPEED UP
MY PROCESS SO MUCH

226
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:17,028
THAT WE WON'T EVEN
BLINK AT THAT $3,500.

227
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,897
Fred:
LOOKS LIKE HELL, DON'T IT?

228
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,298
CALLING IT A GRABOID?

229
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,500
YOU KNOW THE LITTLE MACHINES
THAT PULL UP TEDDY BEARS?

230
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:23,901
MM-HMM.
YEAH, YEAH.

231
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:27,171
IT'S MADE SPECIFICALLY
FOR LIFTING UP ROCKS.

232
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,107
I WAS WATCHING YOU GUYS
THE OTHER DAY.

233
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:30,775
AND -- AND THE CABLE

234
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:32,977
JUST KEPT SLIPPING OFF
AND SLIPPING OFF.

235
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,979
AND, UH, THIS WILL HELP US

236
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,749
GET THOSE ROCKS OUTTA THERE
QUICKLY AND EFFICIENCY.

237
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:42,052
Narrator: DUSTIN'S GRABOID
IS MADE UP OF THREE

238
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:46,925
TONGS CONNECTED TOGETHER
BY A COLLAR AT THE TOP.

239
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:48,660
AS THE COLLAR IS RAISED,

240
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:52,730
THE TONGS PIVOT AND CLOSE
AROUND THE ROCK.

241
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:56,066
THE INGENIOUS THING ABOUT
THE PIVOT MECHANISM IS THAT,

242
00:13:56,068 --> 00:14:01,272
THE HEAVIER THE ROCK,
THE STRONGER THE GRIP.

243
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:04,142
WOW. WELL, THESE ARE
THE JAWS, OBVIOUSLY.

244
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:06,611
LOOKS LIKE IT'S GONNA
WORK FOR ME.

245
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:08,213
IT'S GOT A 30-INCH
GRIP ON IT.

246
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:11,682
SO WE CAN GRAB UP
TO 30-INCH ROCKS.

247
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,084
IT'LL SPEED UP MY PROCESS.

248
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:16,020
HOPEFULLY, THIS IS THE ANSWER
TO ALL OUR STRUGGLES UNDERWATER.

249
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,156
YEAH, IF I CAN GET THAT
PIECE OF TRASH ROCK OUT.

250
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:19,624
TO GET ONE ROCK OUT.

251
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:22,359
WE GOTTA GO SET UP SOME
SERIOUS ANCHORS FOR THIS THING.

252
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,294
Y'ALL READY? Y'ALL WITH ME?

253
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:24,362
YUP.
YUP.

254
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,364
'KAY. LET'S DO IT.
GO GET SUITED UP.

255
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:34,305
Narrator: COUPLED WITH THE COST
OF THE HELICOPTER LIFT

256
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:36,240
TO GET THE GRABOID TO SITE,

257
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:40,645
DUSTIN'S NEW DEVICE
HAS SET THEM BACK $5,000,

258
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:43,314
ALMOST THE LAST
OF THEIR CASH.

259
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,249
I got it.

260
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,318
Dustin:
GRABOID'S COMING IN.

261
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,921
Carlos:
RIGHT OVER US.

262
00:14:49,923 --> 00:14:51,389
THAT WAS
PRETTY QUICK!

263
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:54,325
WHOO!

264
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:56,761
WHOO-HOO!

265
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:02,533
NAILED IT!

266
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:06,337
Narrator: THE GRABOID WEIGHS
170 POUNDS

267
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:09,474
AND ALSO NEEDS 400 POUNDS
OF GEAR TO RIG IT.

268
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:13,077
[BLEEP] DANG, DUDE!

269
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:20,084
Dustin: 'CROSS THE CREEK,

270
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,754
WE'RE GONNA HAVE THIS ONE LINE
COME INTO RIGHT HERE.

271
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:25,556
HARD ANCHOR POINTS
ON EITHER END.

272
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:28,225
ON THAT CABLE,
IT'S GONNA GO STRAIGHT DOWN.

273
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:29,694
THERE'S A BIG ROCK DOWNSTREAM

274
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:31,562
RIGHT THERE THAT
WE'RE GONNA HOOK THAT TO.

275
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:35,500
AND, HOPEFULLY, IT'S A LOT
CLEANER AND STRONGER.

276
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:38,035
Narrator: DUSTIN'S PLAN --

277
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:42,173
FIRST ATTACH A SUPPORT CABLE
ACROSS THE CREEK.

278
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:44,575
NEXT, RUN THE TRANSPORT CABLE

279
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:46,043
OVER THE DIVE SITE,

280
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:49,614
75 FEET DOWNSTREAM
TO AN ANCHOR POINT.

281
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,252
THE GRABOID CAN THEN LIFT

282
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:57,522
BOULDERS AND DUMP THEM
CLEAR OF THE DIVE SITE.

283
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:05,463
Dustin: I DON'T SEE
MYSELF GOING DOWN.

284
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:08,599
BUT THAT'S WHY THEY
CALL 'EM ACCIDENTS, HUH?

285
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:14,539
THIRTY FEET ABOVE THE BRIDGE,

286
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:17,141
THE ONLY WAY DUSTIN
CAN GET TO THE FAR SIDE

287
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,343
TO FIX ANCHOR POINTS

288
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:22,747
IS BY WADING THROUGH
THE GLACIAL WHITE WATER.

289
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:25,216
BE CAREFUL, MAN.

290
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:27,684
Dustin: I JUST NEED A STICK.
THAT MIGHT BE EASIER.

291
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:30,455
THERE'S A HUGE CHANCE
THAT I'M GONNA GET WET BAD!

292
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:40,497
THIS IS CRAZY, DUDE.

293
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,934
I'M INSANE.

294
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,445
STEP ONE.

295
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:56,246
TO MAKE HOLES
IN THE WALL BIG ENOUGH

296
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:58,649
FOR HIS 3-FOOT ANCHOR BOLTS,

297
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:02,787
DUSTIN HAS TO USE A CORE DRILL.

298
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:05,256
IF WE'RE GONNA LIFT UP
2,000-POUND ROCKS

299
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:08,392
AND IT'S GONNA BE OVER MY HEAD,
I'MA MAKE IT STRONG.

300
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:10,862
I'MA MAKE IT REAL STRONG.

301
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:24,275
Richardson: IN
THERE PRETTY GOOD.

302
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:25,476
YEAH, I'M
HAPPY WITH THAT.

303
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:27,278
TWO IS GONNA BE
ENOUGH, RIGHT?

304
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,946
YES. IT'S PROBABLY
OVERKILL BUT YEAH.

305
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:30,347
I'M FINE WITH OVERKILL.
I UNDERSTAND.

306
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:34,419
CONCRETE THESE THINGS IN,
MAKE 'EM RIGHT.

307
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:36,354
WE'VE GOT THESE LONG
ANCHOR BOLTS.

308
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:38,423
I'M JUST EPOXYING THESE
INTO THESE, UH,

309
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:41,492
THE HOLES THAT DUSTIN BORED.

310
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:43,928
WE'RE GOING EXTRA
STRONG ON THESE.

311
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:51,169
ONCE THAT, UH,
ONCE THAT STUFF SETS,

312
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:55,039
THESE SHOULD BE ANCHORED
IN AS STRONG AS THE ROCK ITSELF.

313
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,440
Fred:
I HAVE NO DOUBT IT'LL HOLD.

314
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,910
PUT SOME GOOD ANCHORS
IN OVER THERE.

315
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:02,513
GOOD, STRONG CABLE
WAY UP TOP,

316
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:06,751
IT LOOKS LIKE THE SYSTEM
WE SHOULD'VE STARTED WITH.

317
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,659
WOO!
WOW.

318
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:16,994
GOOD JOB THERE,
DUSTIN.

319
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,532
USE THE WEBBING.

320
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:23,935
WHEN IT PULLS, IT PULLS
ON ALL THREE ANCHORS

321
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:27,605
AT THE SAME EXACT TIME
AND THE SAME EXACT WEIGHT.

322
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:32,777
I'MA SET IT UP SO STRONG
THAT THING'LL NEVER POP.

323
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:37,147
IT'S GETTING COLD HERE.

324
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:39,683
THE END OF
THE SEASON'S HAPPENING.

325
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:41,152
WE JUST NEED THIS
TO GET DONE.

326
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:43,087
OTHERWISE, I'M NOT GONNA
FINISH THIS DAMN HOLE.

327
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:46,958
WE WON'T HAVE ANY GOLD
AT THE END OF THE SEASON.

328
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,559
Richardson:
THAT'LL WORK.

329
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:50,694
WE'VE GOT THIS LARGE PULLEY
THAT'S GOING ONTO THIS CABLE.

330
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:53,898
ONCE I GET THIS HOOKED UP, WE'RE
GONNA GET IT OUT TO THE MIDDLE.

331
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,367
READY?
YEAH!

332
00:18:58,505 --> 00:19:01,038
OH, YEAH.

333
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:05,776
GONNA SEND
A CABLE DOWNSTREAM.

334
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:09,347
SO WE'RE HOPING WE GOT
ENOUGH STRETCH AND HEIGHT.

335
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,720
GOT IT!

336
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:20,191
OKAY.

337
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:24,729
Narrator: THE CREW HAS BOTH
THE CROSS-CREEK

338
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:27,398
AND DOWNSTREAM CABLES RIGGED.

339
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,599
LOOKING AT THAT DISTANCE,

340
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:31,201
I THINK IT'S GONNA
WORK JUST FINE.

341
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:34,939
GOT OUR COME-ALONG ATTACHED TO

514
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:49,893
BIGGER THAN THAT
BEFORE IT BLEW OUT.

515
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:52,963
THAT'S PRETTY AWFUL.

516
00:28:52,965 --> 00:28:56,033
Narrator: ONE OF DUSTIN'S ANCHOR
POINTS HAS FAILED.

517
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:01,771
Dustin: GOD.

518
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:04,508
SOMETHING RUBBED REAL HARD
ON THIS THING.

519
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,176
THAT ONE SHOWS IT
REALLY CLEARLY.

520
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:07,678
THAT'S GOT A BIG
INDENTION IN IT.

521
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:12,115
AH, LOOK.

522
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:13,784
LOOK.

523
00:29:13,786 --> 00:29:15,786
THAT LITTLE BITTY EDGE
CUT THAT ROPE.

524
00:29:15,788 --> 00:29:17,855
YEAH, ALL THAT JERKING
THAT WAS GOING ON

525
00:29:17,857 --> 00:29:19,990
WHEN IT WAS GOING UP AND DOWN,
IT WAS JUST UP THERE DOING THIS.

526
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:23,861
JUST LIKE THIS.
AND IT CUT IT RIGHT THERE.

527
00:29:23,863 --> 00:29:25,863
YUP.
SEE IT?

528
00:29:25,865 --> 00:29:27,464
THAT LITTLE EDGE
JUST COST ME

529
00:29:27,466 --> 00:29:29,799
A WHOLE BUNCHA MONEY
AND A LOT OF TIME.

530
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:31,635
AND IT COULDA HURT SOMEBODY.

531
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:44,414
DUSTIN, THIS MORNING,
HE'S IN TOWN

532
00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:47,484
TRYING TO FIND SOME PARTS FOR
THAT ROCK LIFTER GRABOID THING

533
00:29:47,486 --> 00:29:50,087
TO, UH, GET THAT THING
BACK AND OPERATIONAL.

534
00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:53,757
WE JUST HAD A CRAP, UH,
LET LOOSE UP ON TOP.

535
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:58,295
UNFORTUNATELY, UH, EVERYTHING
WENT DOWN INTO THE WATER.

536
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:00,030
I HOPE THAT THING'S
GONNA DRY OUT

537
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:01,965
AND BE ALL OPERATIONAL.

538
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:07,771
I'M THINKING BRAND-NEW ANCHOR
RIGHT NOW UNLESS IT DRIES OUT.

THEY HAVE TO GET
DUSTIN'S GRABOID TO WORK.

556
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:56,687
I WENT ALL-OUT AND BOUGHT
THE BIGGEST DAMN CHAINS

557
00:30:56,689 --> 00:30:59,156
I COULD BUY IN TOWN.

558
00:30:59,158 --> 00:31:01,891
IT'S ABOUT 200 POUNDS OF CHAIN.

THEY'RE NOT COMING
LOOSE THIS TIME.

I'M NOT GIVING UP YET.

I DARE YOU TO TRY
TO BREAK THAT!

I UNDERSTAND.

OF PINCH POINTS.

STUPID PEOPLE WITH IT.
