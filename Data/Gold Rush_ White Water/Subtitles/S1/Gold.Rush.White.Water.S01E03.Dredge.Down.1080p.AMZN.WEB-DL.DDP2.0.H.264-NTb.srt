A DEPOSIT BIG ENOUGH

GONNA BE COMING DOWN ANY TIME.

POWERFUL ENOUGH TO ROLL
HALF-TON BOULDERS

74

ALONG THE CREEK BED.

75
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,833

MUCH FROM UP HERE.

FEELING A LITTLE --

VERY GREAT ABOUT THIS.

CRAZY TODAY.

87
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:29,767
LET'S JUST AGREE
ON SOMETHING.

88
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,300
IF SOMETHING'S WRONG,
JUST SAY, "DIVER UP!"

89
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,333
AND THEN, EVERYBODY'S ONBOARD
JUST TO BRING HIM UP

90
00:04:34,367 --> 00:04:36,267
NO MATTER WHAT.
NO, "WHY?" NO, THIS...

91
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,567
-YEAH, GOOD.
-YEAH, SOUNDS GREAT.

92
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,967
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

93
00:04:40,067 --> 00:04:41,867
THAT'S WONDERFUL.
YOU'RE BRINGING IT.

TO PUT ME ON BELAY.

97

YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO DRAG ME OUT OF THE WATER

00:04:55,067 --> 00:04:57,667
WELL, THEN STOP IT.
JUST STOP IT.

102
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,900
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
IN CHARGE.

103
00:04:58,933 --> 00:05:00,167
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO CHANGE ANYTHING.

104
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,400
JUST LET'S DO THIS,
MAN.

105
00:05:02,433 --> 00:05:04,067
THE DEAD LOG IS
TOO HIGH OUT OF THE WATER.

106
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,467
LEAVE IT ALONE.
NO.

107
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,300
IT'S TOO HIGH
OUT OF THE WATER.

108
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,933

I DON'T LIKE IT.

111
00:05:13,433 --> 00:05:16,067

A PROBLEM BEFORE IT HAPPENS.

WE'LL FIX IT, FRED.

IT'S ONE LITTLE BOLT.

114
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,300
WE TAKE IT OUT.
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

115
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,100

121
00:05:36,133 --> 00:05:38,733

I DON'T WANT TO BE.

122
00:05:38,767 --> 00:05:42,067
COME ON. LET'S JUST DO IT.
IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

123
00:05:42,067 --> 00:05:43,967

FRED JUST DOESN'T WANT TO GIVE
UP RESPONSIBILITY TO DUSTIN.

131
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,800

TO TELL HIM WHAT TO DO.

132
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,733
Minor: THAT'S A DANG ALPHA DEAL,
YOU KNOW?

133
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:08,667
I MEAN, FATHER, SON --
SON, FATHER.

134
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,833
I'M JUST SORRY THAT, YOU KNOW,

135
00:06:09,867 --> 00:06:11,633
THAT THINGS GOT
A LITTLE RILED UP.

136
00:06:11,667 --> 00:06:14,067
BUT IT'S NOT A GOOD WAY
TO GO DIVING,

137
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,733
WHEN YOU'RE ALL RILED UP
AND FRUSTRATED.

138
00:06:15,767 --> 00:06:18,733
YOU NEED TO BE REALLY,
REALLY FROSTY ABOUT DIVING.

139
00:06:20,133 --> 00:06:22,167
-LET'S GO.
-WE'RE READY TO DREDGE.

140
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,633
ALL WE NEED IS A DIVER.

141
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:27,200
YOU READY, DUSTIN?

142
00:06:30,067 --> 00:06:31,100
HERE WE GO.

143
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,633
YOU GOT AIR?

144
00:06:48,433 --> 00:06:50,533
DEEP BREATHS, MAN,
DEEP BREATHS.

145
00:06:59,533 --> 00:07:01,433
HOW'S YOUR HOT WATER?
STILL DOING GOOD?

146
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,733
Narrator: DUSTIN IS DREDGING
RIGHT WHERE FRED

147
00:07:05,767 --> 00:07:08,167
FOUND GOLD LAST WEEK.

148
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,167
DUSTIN IS USING THAT DREDGE,
WORKING IT AROUND,

149
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,067
AND IT'S JUST A, LIKE,
A GIANT VACUUM CLEANER.

150
00:07:17,067 --> 00:07:19,667
AND HE'S DREDGING A HOLE,

151
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,767
AND WE'RE JUST TRYING
TO GET DOWN AS DEEP AS WE CAN.

152
00:07:25,267 --> 00:07:28,833
Narrator: THE HOSE SUCKS GRAVEL
FROM THE CREEK BED,

153
00:07:28,867 --> 00:07:31,200
UP INTO THE DREDGE

154
00:07:31,233 --> 00:07:33,767
AND THROUGH THE SLUICE BOX

155
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,900
WHERE THE RIPPLES
CATCH THE GOLD.

156
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:50,067
Fred: I LOVE IT, MAN!
I MEAN, IT WAS WORKING!

157
00:07:50,067 --> 00:07:53,933
Wes: YEP! EVERYTHING IS
WORKING PERFECT.

158
00:07:53,967 --> 00:07:56,067
YOU NOTICE
THERE'S NO MUD IN THAT?

159
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,900
NO, THAT'S CLEAN
RIGHT THERE.

160
00:07:57,933 --> 00:08:00,167
FLUSHED ROCK.
YEAH.

161
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,733
THAT'S NOT DEPOSIT.
THAT'S GLACIER ROCK.

162
00:08:03,767 --> 00:08:06,067
THAT'S GOOD.

163
00:08:06,067 --> 00:08:08,900
IF WE CAN KEEP THIS UP
FOR A COUPLE HOURS...

164
00:08:11,733 --> 00:08:15,500
I THINK IF WE GET DOWN TO
THE VERY BOTTOM OF THIS THING,

165
00:08:15,533 --> 00:08:20,233
I THINK, WE'RE GONNA DO
VERY, VERY WELL.

**

167
00:08:28,867 --> 00:08:30,667
WELL, I'M TELLING YOU
HOWS, MAN,

168
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,900
WOUND UP GETTING
THE GOLD FEVER, HUH?

169
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:35,467
[BLEEP] DAMN.

170

Narrator: BEFORE ANY OF THE CREW
MAKES A CENT THIS YEAR,

00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,233
THEY FIRST NEED TO FIND
42 OUNCES OF GOLD

342
00:17:31,267 --> 00:17:33,433
TO PAY BACK TODD'S LOAN.

343
00:17:33,467 --> 00:17:34,833
GOOD LIFT, MAN!

344
00:17:34,867 --> 00:17:37,400
A GOOD LIFT!

345
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,167
Dustin: SO WE'RE
GONNA PUT THIS THING IN HERE

346
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,233
SO WE CAN REDIRECT THIS WATER
OVER TO THE LEFT OVER HERE.

Wes: WELL, I WAS THINKING,
YOU WANT TO HANG IT ON, LIKE...

348
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,733
Paul: I THINK
RIGHT OFF THIS POINT.

349
00:17:49,767 --> 00:17:51,067
-THAT'S WHAT I KEEP LOOKING AT.
-SOMETHING RIGHT THERE.

350
00:17:51,067 --> 00:17:52,500
YEAH, IT LOOKS
LIKE A GOOD POINT.

351
00:17:52,533 --> 00:17:53,600
WE COULD PUT THAT LEG
IN IT THERE

352
00:17:53,633 --> 00:17:55,600
AND THEN,
PULL IT AROUND.

353
00:17:55,633 --> 00:17:58,767
AS SOON AS WE PUT
THIS DIVERSION IN,

354
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,633
WE CAN DIG ALL THAT OUT.

355
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:02,600
LOOK HOW ANGRY
THIS THING IS, MAN.

356
00:18:02,633 --> 00:18:05,267
THEY WANT TO DEFLECT THIS WATER.

357
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,400
WOW, MAN.

358
00:18:08,633 --> 00:18:09,833

WORKING BEAST, MAN.
ALL RIGHT.

YOU'RE GONNA COME TO ME
AND THEN GO OUT A LITTLE BIT.

367
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,733
A LITTLE BIT MORE.

YOU'RE LOSING OR WHAT?

-CAN YOU KEEP IT ON THAT DECK?
-YEAH.

370
00:18:50,767 --> 00:18:52,267
RIGHT THERE.
ALL RIGHT.

I GOT IT.
NO, IT'S GOOD.

AH! THAT HURT.

376
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:08,433
I'M IMPRESSED
WITH ALL THESE GUYS.

377
00:19:08,467 --> 00:19:10,533
WHEN THEY PUT THEIR
HEADS TOGETHER,

378
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:12,467
THEY COME UP WITH
SOME INTERESTING STUFF.

379
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,800
LOOKING GOOD SO FAR.
I GOT TO GET SOME WADERS ON,

380
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:17,367

FOR THE DIVERSION TO WORK,

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,300
IT MUST BE FIRMLY FIXED
TO THE CREEK WALL.

00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:28,600

OH, I GOT YOU.

386
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,533
BETTER MAKE SURE!

387
00:19:37,567 --> 00:19:39,800

REAL HARD.

390
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,400
THAT'S OLD-SCHOOL [BLEEP]
RIGHT THERE.

391
00:19:56,433 --> 00:20:00,800
THAT'S WHAT WE LIKE
TO CALL DANGEROUS.

392
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,200
WE'RE TRYING TO GET US
A HOLE DRILLED

393
00:20:02,233 --> 00:20:04,900
INTO THE BACK END
OF THIS BEAM HERE

394
00:20:04,933 --> 00:20:07,733
SO WE CAN SLIDE A BOLT IN
SO IT HOLDS IT UP.

395

THE ONLY THING HOLDING IT
IS THIS ROPE RIGHT NOW.

A SAFE ZONE TO DIVE IN.

WOO.

400
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:26,733
IT'S GONNA
TAKE A WHILE, FOLKS.

401
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,367
SURE YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO DO THIS FOR YOU?

402
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,933
I GOT IT.

403
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:32,400
GOT ABOUT A FEW
MORE INCHES TO GO.

404
00:20:32,433 --> 00:20:34,300
FRED'S TAKEN OVER
MY PLAN.

405
00:20:45,133 --> 00:20:47,200
IT AIN'T GOING
NOWHERE NOW!

DID RIGHT DOWN THERE?

408
00:20:52,733 --> 00:20:54,633
FREAKING A MAD MAN.

WHOA! HOLY [BLEEP]

WE'RE READY
TO PUT BOARDS IN THERE

411
00:20:59,767 --> 00:21:04,067
IN JUST, LIKE,
UGH, JUST A FEW MINUTES.

412
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,067
HEY, FRED,
THAT'S NOT STABLE, BY THE WAY.

413
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,767
I-I KNOW
IT'S NOT STABLE.

414
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,600
OKAY, AS LONG AS YOU KNOW
IT'S NOT STABLE.

415
00:21:11,633 --> 00:21:13,867
DON'T FALL IN.

416
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,467
OH [BLEEP]

417
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,533
SEE IF THIS WORKS.

418
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:21,367
THAT'S PERFECT.

419
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,267
FRED'S 72.

420
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,933
AND HE LOVES TO BE
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WORK.

421
00:21:26,967 --> 00:21:28,533
NOT HOLDING BACK.

422
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,100
Wes: THERE IS ONE
THAT'S SHORTER.

423

LOOK AT THIS.

THE CURRENT OVER HERE.

00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:54,200
WE GOT IT!
GOOD JOB, GUYS!

Paul: DUSTIN,
THIS ISN'T WORKING.

428
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,100
THAT IS A LOT OF WATER.

429
00:22:05,133 --> 00:22:06,533
Dustin: YEAH, THERE'S
DEFINITELY TOO MUCH WATER

430
00:22:06,567 --> 00:22:08,667
COMING THROUGH TO THE DIVERSION.

431
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,233
I DIDN'T THINK THERE'D BE
EVEN HALF THIS WATER.

Narrator: McKINLEY CREEK FLOWS
AT 8 TONS PER SECOND.

433
00:22:16,067 --> 00:22:20,500
THE HALF-INCH GAPS ARE LETTING
TOO MUCH WATER THROUGH.

434
00:22:20,533 --> 00:22:22,067
WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT
THIS WHOLE THING.

435
00:22:22,067 --> 00:22:23,133
HOW YOU GONNA DO THIS?

436
00:22:23,167 --> 00:22:26,667
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE
TO DO RIGHT NOW.

437
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,600
DO YOU HAVE A --
A SOLUTION?

438
00:22:30,633 --> 00:22:32,100
WHY DON'T WE JUST TAKE
A PIECE OF PLYWOOD

439
00:22:32,133 --> 00:22:33,333
AND SHOVE IT ALL THE WAY
TO THE LEFT?

440
00:22:33,367 --> 00:22:35,500
WELL, PLYWOOD IS GONNA BEND.
I MEAN, IT'S --

441
00:22:35,533 --> 00:22:37,600
NO, IT'LL BE RIGHT UP
AGAINST THE WALL.

442
00:22:37,633 --> 00:22:39,067
OKAY.

443
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:40,567
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET
SOME PLYWOOD AND PUT IT IN --

444
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,200
JAM IT DOWN THERE SIDEWAYS,
PIN IT TO THE WALL.

00:22:44,233 --> 00:22:46,433
HE CAN'T HELP
BUT STAND OVER MY SHOULDER

446
00:22:46,467 --> 00:22:47,867
AND TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

447
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:53,100
Fred: LET'S SEE IF WE CAN
MAKE THIS THING WORK.

448
00:22:53,133 --> 00:22:54,767
UGH!

450

HE KNOWS BEST.

451
00:22:58,833 --> 00:23:02,500
AND HE'S -- HE'S GOT
A LOT OF AGE ON ME.

452
00:23:02,533 --> 00:23:04,667
BUT THAT'S NOT THE SAME THING.

453
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,067
YOU CAN'T REALLY EXPLAIN
THAT TO A FRED HURT, THOUGH.

454

[ CHUCKLING ]

455
00:23:08,733 --> 00:23:10,667

457
00:23:11,833 --> 00:23:13,333
IT'S GONNA GO STRAIGHT
DOWN RIGHT THERE.

458
00:23:13,367 --> 00:23:14,933
-OVER THE EDGE?
-YEAH.

459
00:23:14,967 --> 00:23:16,167
OKAY.

460
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,067
HERE WE GO.
THIS IS GONNA BE CRAZY.

461
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:21,100
YOU GOT A HOLD
OF IT?

462
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:22,400
YEP, GOT A HOLD OF IT.

463
00:23:22,433 --> 00:23:23,533
COME ON!

464
00:23:23,567 --> 00:23:25,967
WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU ADD FRED HURT,

465
00:23:26,067 --> 00:23:28,800
A FULL SHEET OF PLYWOOD,
AND RAGING WATER?

466
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:31,367
THIS CAN'T BE ANYTHING
BUT CHAOS.

467
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,267
IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE
SOME HELP DOWN THERE.

468
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,467
BUT I GUESS EVERYBODY
IS GONNA STAND THERE AND WATCH.

469

HELLS YEAH!

470
00:23:40,133 --> 00:23:41,433
ALL RIGHT?

471
00:23:41,467 --> 00:23:43,967
I'LL SEE IF I CAN WRESTLE
THE DAMN THING INTO PLACE.

472
00:23:44,067 --> 00:23:45,233
ALL RIGHT.

473
00:23:45,267 --> 00:23:47,067
RESCUE TIME.

TO HOLD ON TO HERE.

475
00:23:52,267 --> 00:23:54,067
HOLD ON A SECOND. I'LL GIVE YOU
A HAND IN A SECOND.

476
00:23:54,067 --> 00:23:56,700
I-I GOT TO GET MYSELF
IN POSITION.

477
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,300
COMING DOWN WITH IT!

00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:04,300
A FULL SHEET OF PLYWOOD.

479

SOMEWHERE.

THAT DID A LOT!

EVERY BIT OF THAT.

WONDERFUL WORK BY FRED.

489
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,333

THE CREDIT HE DESERVED

490

IN THE BEGINNING.
BUT IT WENT RIGHT TOGETHER.

491
00:24:42,367 --> 00:24:44,200

FIGHTING THE CURRENT.

493
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,900

DIVING IN THIS NOW.

494

THAT'S A LOT OF WEIGHT
RIGHT THERE.

505
00:25:23,733 --> 00:25:27,633
IT'S NICE WHEN YOU'RE
ON THE BOTTOM, THOUGH.

506

PRETTY GOOD TO ME.

IN SOME OF THE CRACKS

00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,567
THERE'S GOLD
IN THEIR PLUNGE POOL.

512
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,933
NOW, IT'S FRED'S TURN
TO DIVE IN THE SAFE HAVEN

513
00:25:42,967 --> 00:25:45,667
THEY'VE CREATED
BEHIND THEIR DIVERSION.

514
00:26:04,567 --> 00:26:05,833
SAY IT AGAIN.

515
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,867
HE NEEDS ANOTHER WEIGHT BELT...
TO PUT OVER HIS SHOULDER!

516
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,867
YEAH.

517
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:23,300
HE'S GOT...UGH.

518
00:26:24,633 --> 00:26:26,133
Dustin: YOU WANT MORE WEIGHT?
ALL RIGHT, WHERE YOU WANT IT?

519
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:28,600
YOU WANT ME TO WRAP IT
AROUND YOUR NECK?

520
00:26:28,633 --> 00:26:30,533
PUT IT ON TOP OF YOUR HEAD?
WHERE DO YOU WANT IT?

521
00:26:30,567 --> 00:26:32,500
WANT ME TO STRAP IT
TO THE FLASHLIGHT?

522
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,167
YOU'RE GONNA PUT A WEIGHT BELT
AROUND YOUR NECK?

523
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,733
Y-YOU HEAR WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING, RIGHT?

524
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,967
OKAY.

525
00:26:52,467 --> 00:26:53,833
Minor: I'M MAKING
ANOTHER WEIGHT BELT,

526
00:26:53,867 --> 00:26:56,733
ABOUT 20 POUNDS.

527
00:26:56,767 --> 00:26:59,233
HEY, IF HE WANTS IT,
HE GETS IT, MAN.

528
00:27:03,233 --> 00:27:05,700
**

529
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:20,700
Narrator: 72-YEAR-OLD FRED

530
00:27:20,733 --> 00:27:24,767
IS PUTTING HIS NECK ON THE LINE
TO GET TO THE GOLD.

531
00:27:25,867 --> 00:27:27,567
[ AS FRED ]

532
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,400
[ CHUCKLING ]

**

534
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:34,833
Dustin: THERE WE GO,
A FEW ROCKS.

535
00:28:34,867 --> 00:28:37,967
Narrator: THE CALM WATER CREATED
BY THE NEW DIVERSION

536
00:28:38,067 --> 00:28:40,367
MEANS FRED CAN SUCK UP
MORE RIVER GRAVEL

537
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,200
INTO THE DREDGE
AND THROUGH ITS SLUICE BOX.

538
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:06,167
THE CREEK'S WATER IS 38 DEGREES,
JUST ABOVE FREEZING.

539
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,167
IF THE DREDGE STOPS
PUMPING HOT WATER

540
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,600
THROUGH HIS WET SUIT,

541
00:29:09,633 --> 00:29:13,067
FRED WOULD DIE
OF HYPOTHERMIA IN MINUTES.

542
00:29:14,533 --> 00:29:16,067
Fred: UGH!

543
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,167
AYE YI YI.

544
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,700
DIVER IS COMING OUT.

545
00:29:44,733 --> 00:29:47,133
AH [BLEEP]

546
00:29:52,067 --> 00:29:53,733
GET THAT --
YEAH, THERE YOU GO.

547
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,300
Dustin: PULL THAT
OFF YOUR FACE.

548
00:29:57,333 --> 00:30:00,200
NEVER MIND. I DON'T WANT
TO RIP YOUR DAMN FACE OFF.

549
00:30:00,233 --> 00:30:02,500
THE WATER JUST GOT
FROZEN DOWN THERE.

550
00:30:06,167 --> 00:30:08,233
WE GOT A HOT ROOM FOR YOU
COMING UP.

551
00:30:08,267 --> 00:30:12,200
MY LEGS ARE SHAKING
RIGHT NOW.

552
00:30:13,733 --> 00:30:17,100
Minor:
YEAH, GET SOME, FRED.

553
00:30:17,133 --> 00:30:20,900
WELL, I CAN HEAR.

554
00:30:20,933 --> 00:30:22,800
Fred: KEPT GETTING COLDER
AND COLDER AND COLDER.

555
00:30:22,833 --> 00:30:24,300
AND, FINALLY,
I JUST WAS SHAKING.

556
00:30:24,333 --> 00:30:28,167
AND I JUST HAD TO COME OUT.

557
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,300
GOOD JOB TODAY, FRED.

558
00:30:29,333 --> 00:30:31,167
YOU WERE DOWN THERE
FOR A LONG TIME.

559
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,100
YOU GOT SOME
BIG-OLD ROCKS OUT NOW.

560
00:30:33,133 --> 00:30:36,133
I'VE GOT TO GO
IN THE HOT ROOM.

561
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,567
OH, IT'S HOT, MAN.

562
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,933
OH, I LOVE IT.
I CAN FEEL IT.

563
00:30:39,967 --> 00:30:42,667
WOO-HOO!
COME ON, HOT ROOM.

564
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:47,333
OH, IT'S LIKE
A BLAST FURNACE IN HERE.

565
00:30:47,367 --> 00:30:50,433
HE DID IT
WITHOUT HOT WATER.

566
00:30:50,467 --> 00:30:52,100
Paul: YEAH, I THINK
THAT'S THE REASON

567
00:30:52,133 --> 00:30:53,533
WHY FRED WASN'T
GETTING ANY HOT WATER.

568
00:30:53,567 --> 00:30:54,533
OUR LINE --

569
00:30:54,567 --> 00:30:57,233
THE PLASTIC FITTING BROKE
RIGHT IN TWO.

570
00:30:57,267 --> 00:30:59,467
SO IT WASN'T PUMPING
NO HOT WATER IN ON HIM.

571
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,067
I-I SEEN IT SQUIRTING.

572
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,333
BUT I-I JUST THOUGHT
IT WAS JUST A LOOSE FITTING.

573
00:31:03,367 --> 00:31:04,867
I HAD NO IDEA
IT WAS BROKEN.

574
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,267
I DIDN'T EITHER
UNTIL I CAME OVER AND LOOKED.

575
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:09,067
AND I WAS, LIKE, "OH [BLEEP]
NO WONDER HE HAS NO WATER.

576
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,500
THAT'S WHY HE GOT COLD."

577
00:31:10,533 --> 00:31:12,733
Dustin: FOR WHATEVER REASON,
THEY KEEP BREAKING FROM --

578
00:31:12,767 --> 00:31:14,100
FROM THE VIBRATION...

579
00:31:14,133 --> 00:31:15,433
THIS THING --
THIS THING VIBRATES A LOT, MAN.

580
00:31:15,467 --> 00:31:17,600
-THE VIBRATING IS...
-THIS THING VIBRATES A LOT.

581
00:31:17,633 --> 00:31:19,700
YEAH, AND IT'S JUST
VIBRATING AT THE DUCT.

582
00:31:19,733 --> 00:31:21,467
SO I GUESS THE PLAN IS,
WE'RE GONNA REPLACE

583
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,667
ALL THESE PLASTIC FITTINGS
WITH STEEL FITTINGS.

584
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,067
OH, THERE YOU GO.
NOW LIFT IT.

585
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,133
Minor: THERE'S ALWAYS
A FREAKIN' MALFUNCTION.

586
00:31:28,167 --> 00:31:31,600
MECHANICAL ISSUE AND NATURE
TRYING TO KILL YOU, MAN,

587
00:31:31,633 --> 00:31:34,067
THAT'S NOT A GOOD RECIPE, BRO.

588
00:31:34,067 --> 00:31:37,567
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WOULD
PUT PLASTIC FITTINGS

589
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,833
ON SOMETHING
THAT GETS HOT.

590
00:31:38,867 --> 00:31:41,433
-I DON'T -- I DON'T EITHER.
-IT MAKES NO SENSE.

591
00:31:41,467 --> 00:31:42,767
Wes: NO.

592
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,967
Narrator: IF WES AND PAUL CAN
FIX THE HOT WATER SYSTEM,

593
00:31:46,067 --> 00:31:49,100
THE CREW CAN GET IN
ONE MORE DIVE TODAY.

594
00:31:49,133 --> 00:31:51,133
NO MORE PLASTIC
ON THAT ONE.

595
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:53,067
THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.

596
00:31:53,067 --> 00:31:55,133
Paul: WE REPLACED
THE PLASTIC FITTINGS WITH STEEL.

597
00:31:55,167 --> 00:31:58,067
SO, HOPEFULLY, WE DON'T
BREAK ANY MORE LINES.

598
00:31:58,067 --> 00:32:01,167
I THINK WE'RE READY TO GO.
ALL WE GOT TO DO IS TRY IT OUT.

599
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,867
Narrator: IT'S TIME FOR CARLOS

600
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:07,600
TO MAKE HIS DEBUT DIVE
AT McKINLEY.

601
00:32:07,633 --> 00:32:10,767
Minor: LAST TIME I DOVE WAS
IN DECEMBER 2015.

602
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,067
UNFORTUNATELY, WE DON'T
GET PAID DEATH PAY HERE.

603
00:32:13,067 --> 00:32:15,767
OR, AT LEAST,
IT WOULDN'T BE MUCH.

604
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,733
Narrator: AFTER SERVING
IN THE MARINE CORPS,

605
00:32:17,767 --> 00:32:21,833
CARLOS SPENT 13 YEARS DIVING
IN THE GULF OF MEXICO.

606
00:32:21,867 --> 00:32:23,667
MOMENT OF TRUTH, AMIGO!

607
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,067
MOMENT OF TRUTH IS
RIGHT UPON US.

608
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,700
IT'S TIME TO MAKE PEACE
WITH THIS LADY.

609
00:32:28,733 --> 00:32:30,900
BUT HE'S NEVER MINED FOR GOLD

610
00:32:30,933 --> 00:32:33,767
IN A FREEZING,
FAST-FLOWING CREEK.

611
00:32:37,267 --> 00:32:40,867
Minor: IF I WALK OUT
OF THAT WATER...BREATHING,

612
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,300
WITH ALL MY FINGERS INTACT,

613
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:43,733
I THINK I WILL CALL THAT
FOR A SUCCESS.

614
00:32:43,767 --> 00:32:45,533
BUT I HAVE NO IDEA

615
00:32:45,567 --> 00:32:48,367
HOW I GOT MYSELF
INTO THIS KIND OF STUFF, MAN.

616
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,133
Dustin: WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO
IS A LOT OF WORK, MAN.

617
00:32:51,167 --> 00:32:52,467
START THIS.
FOLLOW THE WALL.

618
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,067
AND THEN I WANT YOU TAKE
ALL THAT OUT, TOO.

619
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:58,933
I REALLY WANT TO SEE A HUGE
DAMN HOLE HERE, ALL RIGHT?

620
00:32:58,967 --> 00:33:01,667
-GOT YOU, MAN.
-JUST TAKE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.

621
00:33:02,867 --> 00:33:04,567
Dustin: HOW WE DOING?

622
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,133
Wes: IT'S BARELY WARM.

623
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,233
IT'S STARTING TO GET THERE.

624
00:33:09,267 --> 00:33:11,433
IT'S JUST ENGINES
TAKE A WHILE TO WARM UP.

625
00:33:11,467 --> 00:33:12,533
THEY -- THEY'RE TINY.

626
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,833
WOO, THAT'S HOT! HOLD ON.

627
00:33:19,867 --> 00:33:22,767
IT'S HOT AS [BLEEP]
WE'LL GET YOU IN THERE.

628
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,233
YOU TAKE A LITTLE BIT
OF TRIAL AND ERROR HERE, BUDDY.

629
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,567
FEELING GOOD?

630
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,933
OKAY.
LET'S GO SWIMMING.

631
00:33:33,967 --> 00:33:35,967
Minor: DIVER IN THE WATER.

632
00:33:36,067 --> 00:33:37,267
AHH!

633
00:33:40,467 --> 00:33:42,100
HEY, CARLOS,
THAT WATER'S NOT LIKE

634
00:33:42,133 --> 00:33:43,533
THE GULF OF MEXICO,
IS IT?

635
00:33:43,567 --> 00:33:46,900
NO! THIS IS NOTHING
LIKE THE GULF OF MEXICO.

636
00:33:46,933 --> 00:33:48,500
IT'S ABOUT 80 DEGREES
IN THE GULF OF MEXICO.

637
00:33:48,533 --> 00:33:49,833
OH, YEAH.

638
00:33:49,867 --> 00:33:52,433
I MEAN.
IT'S WARM WHEN IT'S 40 HERE.

639
00:33:55,067 --> 00:33:57,400
WELL, HOW DOES IT FEEL
DOWN THERE?

640
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,567
**

641
00:34:06,767 --> 00:34:08,400
Fred: GIVE IT HELL.
WE WANT TO SEE SOME --

642
00:34:08,433 --> 00:34:11,233
WE WANT TO SEE SOME ROCKS
COMING OUTTA THAT SLUICE BOX.

643
00:34:12,667 --> 00:34:15,933
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY
ABOUT BEGINNER'S LUCK, MAN.

644
00:34:15,967 --> 00:34:17,433
FIRST TIME
ON THE DREDGE,

645
00:34:17,467 --> 00:34:19,933
OH, BRING OUT A NUGGET
OUT OF THERE.

646
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,967
THE SLUICE LOOKS
REALLY GOOD.

647
00:34:33,067 --> 00:34:36,500
IT LOOKS LIKE EVERYTHING
IS ROLLING PERFECT.

648
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:39,533
WOO! HE'S DIGGING, MAN.

649
00:34:39,567 --> 00:34:42,167
THIS IS A GREAT DAY FOR ME.
WE'RE MOVING YARDAGE.

650
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,233
I THINK WE'RE GONNA
GET GOLD OUT OF THIS STUFF.

651
00:34:44,267 --> 00:34:46,100
Fred: COMING ON UP.

652
00:34:46,133 --> 00:34:48,700
SET THE DREDGE OFF
TO THE SIDE THERE.

653
00:34:48,733 --> 00:34:50,067
AHH.

654
00:34:50,067 --> 00:34:56,100
HE'S BEEN DOWN A COUPLE HOURS
AND...LOOKING GOOD, MAN!

655
00:34:56,133 --> 00:34:58,800
-GOOD TIMES?
-GET PUMPED.

656
00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:00,933
ALL RIGHT.
GOOD JOB, MAN. GOOD JOB.

657
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:04,267
Minor: AND I WAS RIGHT NEXT
TO THE DIVERSION.

658
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:08,233
YOU CAN SEE
THE DIFFERENCE OF WATER,

659
00:35:08,267 --> 00:35:09,833
THIS BEING VERY NICE

660
00:35:09,867 --> 00:35:13,167
AND THAT OTHER SIDE
OF THAT FREAKIN' DIVERSION.

661
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,900
I CAN PUT MY HANDS
UNDERNEATH AND ALL THAT,

662
00:35:14,933 --> 00:35:16,500
AND IT WANTS TO RIP IT OFF.

663
00:35:16,533 --> 00:35:18,867
AWESOME, MAN.
WE MOVED SOME DIRT TODAY.

664
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:22,233
YEAH.
TOLD YOU, MAN, 100%.

665
00:35:22,267 --> 00:35:24,200
MADE FRIENDS
WITH THIS [BLEEP] DAMN CREEK.

666
00:35:24,233 --> 00:35:26,400
HOPEFULLY, I'LL LIKE IT
FOR A LITTLE BIT LONGER.

667
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:34,200
**

668
00:35:38,467 --> 00:35:39,967
Paul: WE'RE GONNA PULL
ALL THESE MATS OUT NOW,

669
00:35:40,067 --> 00:35:42,933
CLEAN THEM OUT,
SEE WHAT WE COME UP WITH.

670
00:35:42,967 --> 00:35:45,567
I THINK WE DID
PRETTY GOOD ON THIS ONE.

671
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,067
LOVE TO GET SOME GOLD.

672
00:35:47,067 --> 00:35:48,500
Fred: REALLY HOPEFUL
THAT WE'RE GONNA SEE SOME

673
00:35:48,533 --> 00:35:51,500
CLINKERS COMING OUT OF THERE,

674
00:35:51,533 --> 00:35:53,500
NOT THEM LITTLE,
PING, PING, PING,

675
00:35:53,533 --> 00:35:56,067

**

677
00:36:07,067 --> 00:36:10,767
LOOKING GOOD.
I KNOW THEY SURE SMELL GOOD.

WHEN I DROP MATERIAL IN IT,

714
00:38:10,567 --> 00:38:13,300
IT GOES THROUGH A CLASSIFYING
SCREEN ON THE INSIDE,

INTO ARCHIMEDES' SCREW.

716

AND IT CLIMBS THE GOLD BACK UP

717
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,367
AND DROPS IT OUT
INTO OUR SLUICE BOX.

FROM THE HEAVY STUFF.
