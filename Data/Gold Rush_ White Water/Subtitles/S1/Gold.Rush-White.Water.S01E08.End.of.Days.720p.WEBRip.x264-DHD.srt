00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:33,209
BET IT'S NOT WORTH
5 FOOT DEEP RIGHT THERE.

678
00:38:33,211 --> 00:38:35,679
YEAH, I BET YOU'RE RIGHT.

679
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:42,151
Narrator: IT TOOK 4 MONTHS
TO DIG DOWN TO BEDROCK GOLD.

680
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,287
BUT NOW, IN 5 MINUTES,

681
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:47,424
THEIR DIVERSION
HAS BEEN BLOWN AWAY.

682
00:38:47,426 --> 00:38:49,625
THE STORM'S AFTERMATH
AND TORRENT

683
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:51,895
HAVE REFILLED THEIR HOLE.

684
00:38:51,897 --> 00:38:53,963
GAME OVER.

685
00:38:53,965 --> 00:38:57,233
Dustin: SORRY, GUYS.
I KNOW WE WERE CLOSE.

686
00:38:57,235 --> 00:38:59,369
BUT, UH, THIS IS DONE, MAN.

687
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:00,837
WE'RE DONE.

688
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,638
WE AIN'T GONNA BE
DOING NO MORE WORK.

689
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,908
Carlos: YOU CAN'T MAKE UP
THIS KINDA [BLEEP] DUDE.

690
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:08,845
SWEAT AND BLOOD
FOR GOLD, FIND GOLD.

691
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:11,046
THE RIVER TAKES IT AWAY.

692
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:13,183
Dustin: ONE MINUTE,
THERE'S BEDROCK.

693
00:39:13,185 --> 00:39:15,552
THE NEXT MINUTE,
EVERYTHING'S GONE.

694
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:23,059
IT'S A HORRIBLE WAY
TO END THE SEASON.

695
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:25,461
WE SHOULD BE ENDING
THE SEASON ROLLING IN GOLD.

696
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:30,367
BUT, INSTEAD, ALL OF
OUR WORK GOT WIPED OUT.

697
00:39:33,739 --> 00:39:38,341
Narrator: WES HAS ONE LAST
SURPRISE FOR DUSTIN.

698
00:39:38,343 --> 00:39:40,610
Wes: MAN, DUDE,
CHECK THIS OUT.

699
00:39:40,612 --> 00:39:42,211
THAT'S FROM THAT
DIVE THAT FRED DID

700
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,747
BEFORE WE GOT FLOODED OUT.
LOOK AT THAT.

701
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:46,349
Dustin: NICE TO KNOW THAT
THERE'S BIG CHUNKY

702
00:39:46,351 --> 00:39:47,751
GOLD SITTING DOWN THERE.

703
00:39:47,753 --> 00:39:49,686
WE WERE RIGHT
THERE ON IT, MAN.

704
00:39:49,688 --> 00:39:51,421
CHECK THIS OUT, GUYS.
DAMN.

705
00:39:51,423 --> 00:39:52,689
WOW.
YOU WERE THERE.

706
00:39:52,691 --> 00:39:54,423
WE WERE THERE.
WE FOUND IT.

707
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:56,092
I THINK THAT WAS ONLY,
LIKE, 30 MINUTES.

708
00:39:56,094 --> 00:39:58,361
IF WE HEADED TO A PLACE
WHERE WE COULD DIG IN THAT

709
00:39:58,363 --> 00:40:00,162
BOTTOM EVERY DAY,

710
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:01,898
YOU FOLLOW
THAT GOLD STREAK,

711
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,901
WE SHOULD HAVE 10 OF THESE
FULL OF GOLD, MAN.

712
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:07,703
-YEAH, WE'D HAVE KILLED IT.
-HOW'D IT LOOK OVERALL?

713
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:10,640
UH, LET ME GRAB IT.

714
00:40:10,642 --> 00:40:12,575
GOOD JOB, GUYS.
THAT'S FREAKING AWESOME, BRO.

715
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:14,110
THAT'S FREAKING
BEAUTIFUL, BRO.

716
00:40:14,112 --> 00:40:16,246
Richardson: WE'RE CLOSE, MAN.
WE'RE CLOSE.

717
00:40:16,248 --> 00:40:17,580
BEAUTIFUL.

718
00:40:19,317 --> 00:40:20,950
Narrator: ADDING
TO THIS WEEK'S CHUNKY

719
00:40:20,952 --> 00:40:23,118
BEDROCK GOLD,

720
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,656
THE CREW SEES THE FRUITS
OF THEIR SEASON'S LABOR,

721
00:40:26,658 --> 00:40:31,861
MORE THAN HALF OF WHICH
THEY MADE IN THE LAST FEW DAYS.

722
00:40:31,863 --> 00:40:35,265
TWO AND A HALF OUNCES.

723
00:40:35,267 --> 00:40:37,132
TWO AND A HALF OUNCES,

724
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:39,535
WORTH JUST $3,000

725
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:44,073
BUT PROOF THEY WERE
ON THE VERGE OF MILLIONS.

726
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:47,076
I KNOW IT'S NOT THAT IMPRESSIVE.
BUT WE GOT TO THE GOLD.

727
00:40:47,078 --> 00:40:50,279
BUT WE DIDN'T RETRIEVE
ALL OF IT YET.

728
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:53,550
IT'S A SAD THING THAT WE
DIDN'T GET RICH THIS YEAR.

729
00:40:53,552 --> 00:40:55,285
Fred:
BITTERSWEET, YOU KNOW.

730
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:57,086
HEY,
BUT THE MAIN THING HERE --

731
00:40:57,088 --> 00:41:00,490
WHATEVER IS DONE THERE
IS STILL THERE.

732
00:41:00,492 --> 00:41:02,292
WE NEED TO COME BACK
AND GET IT.

733
00:41:02,294 --> 00:41:03,893
WE'LL GET IT
NEXT YEAR, FOR SURE.

734
00:41:03,895 --> 00:41:07,297
WELL, I WILL BE STARTING MY
CONSTRUCTION JOB FOR THE WINTER.

735
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:11,367
AND I HOPE TO MAKE
ENOUGH MONEY TO START OVER.

736
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:14,437
ANYBODY FEEL LIKE COMING BACK,
EVEN THOUGH WE GOT 2 1/2 OUNCES?

737
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:17,172
NOW THAT WE SEE THE GOLD'S
GETTING BIGGER AND CHUNKIER,

738
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:18,441
I'LL BE HERE.

739
00:41:19,511 --> 00:41:21,911
I'LL COME BACK.
YEAH, YOU'VE BEEN A REALLY,

740
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:24,514
REALLY GOOD PART
OF THIS GROUP, MAN.

741
00:41:24,516 --> 00:41:26,516
I'LL COME BACK...

742
00:41:26,518 --> 00:41:29,519
ON MY OWN TERMS.

743
00:41:29,521 --> 00:41:31,053
OUR GOLD
IS STILL THERE, BOYS.

744
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:33,356
AT LEAST WE KNOW IT'S SAFE
DOWN -- DOWN THERE, RIGHT?

745
00:41:35,594 --> 00:41:38,194
WE KNOW THAT THERE'S
GOLD DOWN THERE.

746
00:41:38,196 --> 00:41:41,264
WE'RE NOT JUST HOPEFUL.
WE KNOW IT.

747
00:41:41,266 --> 00:41:42,665
WE'VE PROVEN THAT THERE

748
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:45,869
IS GOLD DOWN THERE
AND A LOT OF IT.

749
00:41:45,871 --> 00:41:48,338
WE JUST HAVEN'T
GOT TO IT YET.

750
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,539
AH, SO CLOSE.
