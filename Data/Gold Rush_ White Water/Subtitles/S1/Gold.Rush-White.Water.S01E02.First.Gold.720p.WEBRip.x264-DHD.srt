1
00:00:03,904 --> 00:00:06,839
DUSTIN, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE
[BLEEP] YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

2
00:00:06,841 --> 00:00:08,574
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.
YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

3
00:00:08,576 --> 00:00:11,309
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY [BLEEP] IDEA
OF WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH

4
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:13,912
AND WHAT I'VE DONE AND THE
EXPERIENCE THAT I [BLEEP] HAVE

5
00:00:13,914 --> 00:00:16,381
AND WHAT I'VE SACRIFICED
TO GET TO THIS POINT

6
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:18,984
TO BE QUALIFIED TO BE HERE IN
THIS [BLEEP] CREW WITH YOU GUYS.

7
00:00:18,986 --> 00:00:20,986
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
YOU'RE NOT QUALIFIED

8
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:22,454
TO BE IN THIS [BLEEP] CREW.

9
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:23,922
YOU'RE QUALIFIED TO...
ALL RIGHT. THEN, I'M DONE.

10
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:24,923
THEN I'LL LEAVE.
THEN BE GONE.

11
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:26,258
[ BLEEP ].
IT'S THAT [BLEEP] SIMPLE.

12
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,993
I'M OUT OF HERE.

13
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:30,162
GO. DO YOUR THING.

14
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:34,600
PICK UP ON THE FRONT END.

15
00:00:34,602 --> 00:00:36,201
YOU'RE NOT EVEN
LINED UP YET.

16
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:37,936
DUSTIN, WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?

17
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:40,405
DON'T MAKE ME TAKE CHARGE.
I DON'T WANT TO.

18
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:42,607
I WANT TO INTRODUCE
YOU TO CARLA.

19
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:45,343
I'M A COMMERCIAL DIVER.
I WORK OFFSHORE OIL PLATFORM

20
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:47,046
FOR 15 YEARS NOW.

21
00:00:51,085 --> 00:00:53,151
DON'T GO INTO THAT
[BLEEP] WHITEWATER.

22
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:55,054
THE WATER'S COMING UP RIGHT NOW.

23
00:00:58,092 --> 00:01:01,493
OKAY,
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY AIR?

24
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:03,395
AH, [BLEEP].

25
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:07,299
UH-OH.
I SAW IT TOO.

26
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:09,567
I SAW IT.
UH-OH.

27
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:10,702
HOLY [BLEEP].

28
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:12,370
DAMN, LOOK AT ALL THAT
GOLD THAT'S IN THERE!

29
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:14,973
THE GOLD IS SITTING
ON THE SURFACE RIGHT NOW.

30
00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:16,441
WE JUST FOUND IT.

31
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:18,977
WOO!

00:01:21,982 --> 00:01:25,484
CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY
DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS

34
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:34,459
DON'T LET GO OF THE END
OF THAT ROPE.

35
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:35,928
THAT'S ALL.

36
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,796
DON'T FALL.

37
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:40,532
TRUST YOU, MAN.

38
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:43,735
Narrator: HIGH IN ALASKA'S
REMOTE CHILKAT MOUNTAINS,

39
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:45,871
THE DAKOTA BOYS
ARE WORKING ON THE TRAIL

40
00:01:45,873 --> 00:01:50,075
BETWEEN THEIR CAMP
AND THE DIVE SITE.

41
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:52,611
WE'VE GOT A TREE THAT'S
HANGING OFF BY THE ROOTS,

42
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,146
STRAIGHT DIRECTLY
OVER OUR TRAIL.

43
00:01:54,148 --> 00:01:55,613
IF IT FELL DOWN
AND HIT ANYBODY,

44
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,482
THAT WOULD BE
THE END OF SOMEBODY.

45
00:01:57,484 --> 00:02:00,352
Dustin: OW.
WE NEED TO GET TO WORK.

46
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:04,490
HOPEFULLY IT ELIMINATES ONE
OF THE PROBLEMS THAT KILLS US.

47
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:08,760
IT SHOULD BE
STRAIGHT BELOW YOU.

48
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:10,762
THAT TREE LOOKS LIKE
IT'S HANGING OVER THE EDGE.

49
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:13,631
YEAH, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF I CAN GET DOWN TO IT.

50
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:14,967
THIS IS A LOT OF WORK.

51
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:17,836
IT REALLY BETTER PAY OFF.
UGH.

52
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:21,773
Narrator: DUSTIN AND HIS CREW
ARE CHASING A DREAM --

53
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:24,776
THAT THESE DEADLY
McKINLEY CREEK RAPIDS

54
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:28,780
HIDE SOME OF ALASKA'S
UNFOUND GOLD DEPOSITS --

55
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:31,116
PLUNGE POOLS BELOW THE SURFACE

56
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:33,619
THAT HAVE TRAPPED
MILLIONS IN GOLD.

57
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:39,858
THIS SEASON'S PRICE TAG,
$50,000 IN RUNNING COSTS.

58
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,195
SO THEY'LL NEED TO FIND
AT LEAST 42 OUNCES OF GOLD

59
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:45,697
BEFORE ANY OF THEM MAKES A CENT.

60
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:51,269
THE RACE IS ON TO FINISH
THEIR DIVE PLATFORM

61
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,805
AND START DREDGING FOR GOLD.

62
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:56,942
BUT FIRST, DUSTIN HAS TO
REMOVE THE DEAD TREE

63
00:02:56,944 --> 00:02:58,610
THAT'S THREATENING
TO FALL ON THEM.

64
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:02,547
Dustin: LITERALLY STANDING ON
TOP OF THEM, I BELIEVE.

65
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:04,015
I CUT THIS LOOSE,
HOPEFULLY THERE'S NO

66
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,284
CHAIN REACTION
AND THINGS FALL ON ME.

67
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:07,552
<i>COPY THAT.</i>

68
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:10,555
CRAZY. IT'S ALL RIGHT.

69
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:14,025
I THINK THE WHOLE LITTLE LEDGE
IS GOING TO GO WHEN IT GOES.

70
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:17,296
COME LOOSE!

71
00:03:17,298 --> 00:03:20,966
YEAH!
FINALLY.

72
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:23,701
THAT WAS A LOT HARDER THAN
I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE.

73
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,304
THANKS FOR CATCHING
MY BACK ON THAT ONE.

74
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:28,773
YOU CONQUERED IT, MAN.
HOLY COW.

75
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:31,243
WELL, THAT'S ONE LESS HEADACHE
WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT NOW.

76
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:33,378
YEAH, SO IT DOESN'T
KILL SOMEBODY.

77
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:43,187
NEXT STEP FOR DUSTIN, PAUL,
WES, AND GREENHORN ZACK --

78
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:46,591
HAUL THE LUMBER OVER
THE TREACHEROUS MILE-LONG TRAIL

79
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:49,328
BETWEEN CAMP
AND THE DIVE SITE.

80
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,397
ZACK, WHAT I NEED YOU TO DO
IS JUST TO GO UP

81
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,599
AND DOWN THAT HILL
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

82
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:56,534
IT'S GOING TO BE
A LOT OF WALKING.

83
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:59,203
MAN, I THINK IT'D BE PERFECT
TO JUST THROW SOME TWO-BY-FOURS

84
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:01,072
IN BETWEEN THAT LITTLE GAP
ON MY HANDLEBARS

85
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,408
ON MY DIRT BIKE THERE
AND JUST SIT ON 'EM

86
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,544
AND RIDE 'EM UP THE HILL.

87
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:09,414
IT'S NOT SAFE ENOUGH
TO BE OVER THERE TO DO THAT.

88
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,084
YOU'D BE JOUSTING
WITH TREES AND STICKS.

89
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:13,618
CAN'T BE LAZY.

90
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,954
I JUST DON'T SEE HOW A SIMPLE
LITTLE IDEA TURNED INTO

91
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:18,189
ME NOT WANTING TO DO IT NOW
AND ME BEING LAZY.

92
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:19,824
I WAS JUST...
NO, NOT LAZY.

93
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:20,826
A LITTLE...

94
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:22,960
IT JUST OPENS YOU UP
FOR TOO MUCH.

95
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:25,897
[ LAUGHS ]

96
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:29,434
YOU KNOW HOW WE ARE.
YOU KNOW HOW WE ROLL.

97
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,369
[BLEEP]

98
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:34,906
WHEN THEY WRITE ME OFF INSTANTLY
WHEN I COME UP WITH AN IDEA,

99
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:37,409
IT REALLY FRUSTRATES ME
AND PISSES ME OFF.

100
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:43,315
ZACK'S ALWAYS TRYING TO FIND
THE EASY WAY, JUST LIKE FRED,

101
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:45,850
BECAUSE HE'S A MACHINE OPERATOR.
BUT OUT HERE,

102
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:51,456
IT TURNS INTO PHYSICAL,
HARD LABOR HAS TO HAPPEN.

103
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,558
LET'S SEE HOW
THAT WORKS OUT.

104
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:58,530
Narrator: 24-YEAR-OLD ZACK HAS
BEEN A LOGGER FOR EIGHT YEARS,

105
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:01,599
BUT THIS IS HIS
FIRST TIME MINING.

106
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:02,801
Zack: YOU KNOW,
I'M THE NEW GUY HERE.

107
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,202
I'M THE LOWEST
ON THE TOTEM POLE.

108
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:07,606
BUT IT IS HARD, ESPECIALLY
COMING FROM A POSITION

109
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:09,007
WHERE I WAS RUNNING
MY OWN CREWS

110
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:12,277
AND I HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE
WORKING UNDER ME TO WHERE NOW,

111
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,746
I'M WORKING UNDER
EVERYBODY ELSE.

112
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:16,615
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M
GOING TO BE ABLE

113
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:18,150
TO GET USED TO THAT, REALLY.

114
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:20,085
I'M GOING TO DO IT MY WAY,
THAT'S JUST ALL THEIR IS TO IT.

115
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:23,221
SO HERE I GO.

116
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:25,290
THIS [BLEEP] SUCKS.

117
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,297
Narrator:
OVER THE LAST 120 YEARS,

118
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:34,232
THE CREEKS AROUND
THE CHILKAT MOUNTAINS

119
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:38,437
HAVE PRODUCED MORE THAN
$100 MILLION WORTH OF GOLD.

120
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:45,977
MEN HAVE MADE THEIR FORTUNES
AND LOST THEIR LIVES.

121
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:49,714
THREE WEEKS AGO, THE DAKOTA BOYS
RETURNED FOR ANOTHER SEASON

122
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:52,851
TO FIND THEIR FORTUNES
DIVING FOR GOLD.

123
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:56,387
I THINK THAT'S GOING TO
MAKE YOU A WEALTHY MAN.

124
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:59,991
BUT FOUND ALL THEIR EQUIPMENT
HAD BEEN DESTROYED.

125
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:02,861
THE WATER MUST'VE
COME UP EIGHT FEET.

126
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,395
THERE AIN'T A THING LEFT.

127
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:07,199
FRED WAS FORCED TO
TAKE A $50,000 LOAN

128
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:11,336
FROM OLD RIVAL TODD HOFFMAN.

129
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:13,472
I WILL BE CHECKING IN.

130
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:17,175
NOW, FRED MUST DEAL
WITH THE CONSEQUENCES.

131
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:25,283
Fred: IF TODD HOFFMAN DOESN'T
HAVE ENOUGH FAITH IN ME

132
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:28,086
THAT HE HAS TO SEND
SOMEONE DOWN,

133
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:31,289
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT HIS BACKGROUND IS,

134
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:35,060
DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR
QUALIFICATIONS ARE, AN OUTSIDER.

135
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,164
I GUESS IF I NEED MONEY,

136
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,533
I HAVE TO PUT UP
WITH CIRCUMSTANCES HERE.

137
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:46,638
YOU MUST BE CARLOS.
YES, SIR.

138
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,706
HOW YOU DOING?
FRED?

139
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,373
FRED, YEAH.
HOW YOU DOING, SIR?

140
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,710
I DIDN'T KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT KIND OF DIVE GEAR TO BRING,

141
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:53,645
SO I JUST BROUGHT
THE WHOLE THING.

142
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:54,846
IT'S PRETTY HEAVY.

143
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:56,181
WE'LL JUST SQUEEZE 'EM
UP IN THERE.

144
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:03,855
WHAT KIND OF
A BACKGROUND DO YOU HAVE?

145
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:05,323
WELL, I'VE DONE 13 YEARS

146
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:07,192
IN THE UNITED STATES
MARINE CORPS.

147
00:07:07,194 --> 00:07:09,260
GOT OUT OF THAT,
WENT INTO COMMERCIAL DIVING,

148
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,096
DID THAT SINCE 2002.

149
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:15,666
YOU KNOW WHY I'M HERE,
RIGHT?

150
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:17,602
UH...
I DO DIVING.

151
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,738
YEAH, I UNDERSTOOD, UH,

152
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,743
TODD WAS SENDING
SOMEBODY UP TO, UH,

153
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:27,946
HE SAID "HELP US OUT."
I HOPE THAT'S THE CASE.

154
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,481
IT'S NOT JUST SOMETHING THAT

155
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:34,085
COME UP HERE TO, UH,
JUST KEEP AN EYE ON US,

156
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:37,154
'CAUSE, UH, WE KNOW
WHAT WE'RE DOING.

157
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:40,425
SENIOR HOFFMAN SENT ME
OUT HERE JUST TO --

158
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:42,127
JUST TO PROTECT
HIS INVESTMENT.

159
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:50,902
Fred: WE'RE AT CAMP.

160
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:52,370
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THIS, MAN?

161
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:55,773
I MEAN, THIS IS WOODS.
DEEP WOODS OUT HERE.

162
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:59,110
I'M MORE FOCUSED ON THAT,
UH, THAT CROSSING RIGHT THERE.

163
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:04,449
THAT'S IT.
THAT'S THE CABLE.

164
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:06,117
Narrator: TO GET TO THEIR CLAIM,

165
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:09,387
THE DAKOTA BOYS HAVE STRUNG
A 250-FOOT CABLE

166
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:14,592
ACROSS A CANYON
THAT'S 400 FEET DEEP.

167
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,327

00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:51,782
NOT ONE OF THESE GUYS
CAN GET IT UP THERE

336
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:55,186
AS EFFICIENTLY AS ME.

337
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:58,656
I AIN'T GOING TO [BLEEP] WALK
THESE THINGS DOWN HERE SLOWLY.

338
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:01,092
LET 'EM FALL.

339
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,431
<i>Dustin: HEY, ZACK,</i>
<i>YOU GOT A COPY, MAN?</i>

340
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:10,067
YEAH, GO FOR ZACK.

341
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:12,737
WHAT'S TAKING YOU SO LONG,
MAN?

342
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:16,007
I'M JUST BUMPING
ALL THE BOARDS

343
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:18,475
DOWN TO THE BOTTOM
OF THE HILL AT ONE TIME

344
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:22,479
SO THAT I'M ONLY MAKING
ONE TRIP AND NOT 15.

345
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:26,150
<i>WELL, WE NEED SOME</i>
<i>LUMBER OVER HERE, MAN.</i>

346
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,819
YEAH, I'LL TAKE TWO
FROM MY PILE

347
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:29,487
AND GET 'EM OVER THERE
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE

348
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:32,222
AND COME BACK
AND FINISH THE JOB.

349
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:34,826
Dustin: DAMN KIDS THESE DAYS.

350
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:36,293
I HAVE TO STOP WHAT I'M DOING,

351
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:38,029
BUMPING ALL THESE BOARDS
DOWN THERE,

352
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:39,764
GO ALL THE WAY
TO WHERE THEY'RE AT,

353
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:42,567
SO THAT I CAN MOVE A BOARD
ONE BY ONE,

354
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:46,771
AND I'M [BLEEP] PISSED.

355
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:51,309
I GUESS I'M JUST USED TO PEOPLE
[BLEEP] DOING WHAT I WANT.

356
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:53,177
THERE HE IS.
HOW'S IT GOING?

357
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:56,481
[BLEEP] BULL [BLEEP].

358
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:01,185
IT'S KIND OF A SKETCHY TRAIL
TO HIKE AFTER YOU'VE BEEN

359
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,855
HIKING UP AND DOWN THAT [BLEEP]
HILL WITH THESE BOARDS.

360
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,656
JUST KEEP 'EM COMING,
MAN.

361
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:13,464
I NEED ABOUT A 30-INCH BOARD,
2x6, MAYBE.

362
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:18,135
Dustin: 30-INCH LONG,
2x6, PLEASE.

363
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:20,805
Fred: JUST TAKE A FEW MINUTES
AND I'LL GET IT DONE.

364
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:23,041
ALL RIGHT.
WE'VE GOT A DIVING BOARD!

365
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:26,878
Narrator: NEXT,
THEY NEED A SYSTEM

366
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,347
TO WINCH THEIR
1,000-POUND DREDGE

367
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:31,482
IN AND OUT OF
THE SAFE HARBOR.

368
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:33,818
Fred: UH, WELL, LET'S SEE.
CAN'T SLACK OFF.

369
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,553
I GOT IT. I GOT IT.
I TOTALLY GOT IT.

370
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,623
WE HOOK THAT WINCH RIGHT HERE
ON THIS POINT, RIGHT?

371
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,693
IT GOES UP TO THE BLOCK,
THROUGH THE BLOCK,

372
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:45,496
AND WE'RE ABLE TO PULL IT
ALL THE WAY OVER TO HERE.

373
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:46,697
IT'LL LIFT IT STRAIGHT UP.

374
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:48,031
I THINK THAT'S GOING TO WORK
RIGHT THERE.

375
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:49,766
YOU GUYS ARE ON
STEP SEVEN, MAN.

376
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:52,503
I'M STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO.

377
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:56,240
Narrator: DUSTINGS PLAN,
SUSPEND 60 FEET OF CABLE

378
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:59,710
ACROSS THE CREEK AND INSTALL
A REMOTE CONTROL WINCH

379
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:01,712
THAT WILL HAUL THE DREDGE

380
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:03,714
UP AND OUT OF THE HARBOR

381
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:05,750
TO WHEREVER THEY NEED IT
FOR MINING.

382
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,790
I'M GOING TO SET
SOME ANCHOR POINTS.

383
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:15,392
WE'RE GOING TO RUN
A ROPE ACROSS,

384
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:17,728
AND WE'RE HOPEFULLY GOING TO
BE ABLE TO PICK THAT DREDGE

385
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,497
RIGHT OUT OF THE WATER.

386
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:24,735
I'VE GOT TO CLIMB UP
ALL THIS WET JUNK.

387
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:26,070
THERE'S ONLY
ONE WAY UP THIS,

388
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:28,406
AND HOPEFULLY I DON'T SLIDE OFF

389
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:31,676
INTO THE DAMN WATER
AND HURT MYSELF.

390
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:36,280
I'M ROPED IN,
BUT THAT'S JUST IN CASE I FALL.

391
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,682
IT SOUNDS ANGRY.

392
00:18:37,684 --> 00:18:40,083
Narrator: THE FREEZING,
GLACIER-FED WATERS

393
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:42,420
OF McKINLEY SURGE THROUGH HERE

394
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:45,590
AT 129,000 GALLONS
EVERY MINUTE.

395
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:53,030
RIGHT NOW, IF DUSTIN WAS
TO SLIP AND FALL,

396
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:55,566
HE'S PRETTY MUCH
A STRAIGHT SHOT DOWN.

397
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:58,502
HE'D EITHER HIT THE LOG DECK,
WHICH WOULDN'T BE GOOD,

398
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,238
OR HE'D HIT THE WATER.

399
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,307
IT'D MESS HIM UP PRETTY BAD
WHERE HE'S AT NOW.

400
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:06,777
Dustin: JUST LIKE I THOUGHT,
SUPER SOFT [BLEEP] ROCK.

401
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:12,583
NOT SOLID?
[BLEEP] DAMN IT.

402
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:14,552
WHAT ABOUT RIGHT
ABOVE THAT SPOT?

403
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:20,992
[ GRUNTS ]

404
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:23,193
THERE IT GOES.
WOO!

405
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,529
HOLDING UP.

406
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,398
YOU CAN ONLY DO THAT
SO MANY TIMES

407
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,333
BEFORE YOUR LUCK
RUNS OUT, MAN.

408
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,936
YOU'RE MISTAKEN IF YOU THINK
THIS IS THE FIRST OR LAST TIME

409
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:34,338
THAT PAUL'S GOING TO HAVE
MY LIFE IN HIS HANDS.

410
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,807
Wes: I THINK HE'S GOT HIS ANCHOR
POINTS HOOKED UP OVER THERE.

411
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:40,077
WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO
GET A CABLE ACROSS NOW.

412
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:44,348
COMING UP.
YEP.

413
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,950
Dustin: IT LOOKS GOOD UP THERE.
I HOPE IT WORKS.

414
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:48,819
IT SHOULD.

415
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:51,956
WE GOT OUR CABLE UP OVER HERE.
WE'VE GOT OUR WINCH SET UP.

416
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,291
ALL WE'RE GOING TO DO
IS PUT 'EM TOGETHER

417
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:54,491
AND SEE IF THEY WORK.

418
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:56,627
Narrator: NOW,
THE MOMENT OF TRUTH --

419
00:19:56,629 --> 00:20:00,898
WINCH THE $13,000 DREDGE
ACROSS THE RAGING CREEK

420
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,935
TO THEIR HARBOR
WITHOUT DESTROYING IT.

421
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:09,307
Fred: SO FAR IT'S OKAY.

422
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:11,742
HOLD IT.

423
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:20,117
YO, CARLOS!
GO GET THAT BLUE ROPE.

424
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:22,853
FOR WHAT?
SAFETY.

425
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:25,255
MAKE IT FAST!

426
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:26,657
Fred: GIVE IT PLENTY OF SLACK,

427
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:30,193
BUT I WANT YOU TO TIE IT
ONTO SOMETHING UP THERE.

428
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:33,464
I WANT YOU TO PICK UP
ON THE FRONT END.

429
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:35,866
YOU'RE NOT EVEN
LINED UP YET.

430
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:38,335
OH, PLEASE, YOU'RE GOING
TO [BLEEP] KILL ME!

431
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:41,004
DON'T MAKE ME TAKE CHARGE.
I DON'T WANT TO.

432
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:42,540
Fred: WHAT I WANT TO KNOW,

433
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:44,141
CAN YOU LIFT
THE FRONT OF THIS BARGE

434
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:46,209
WITH THAT ROPE AT ALL,
JUST THE WAY IT'S RIGGED?

435
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:47,478
I DIDN'T KNOW
WE WERE LIFTING IT.

436
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,213
I THOUGHT WE WERE
GUIDING IT IN.

437
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:52,482
YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS OFF
THE DECK BEFORE YOU...

438
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:54,485
NO, YOU DON'T.
THAT'S HIGH.

439
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:56,821
THIS IS HIGH.
PULL ON IT,

440
00:20:56,823 --> 00:20:58,422
THE [BLEEP] THING WILL COME
OFF OF THE GROUND.

441
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:01,358
I'M SORRY I'M CURSING AT YOU.
I'M TRYING TO CALM DOWN.

442
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,094
ALL RIGHT, DUSTIN.
WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?

443
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:07,231
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM.
TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

444
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:09,367
I ASKED YOU
A SIMPLE QUESTION.

445
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:10,901
NO, I CANNOT
LIFT IT UP.

446
00:21:10,903 --> 00:21:14,104
NO, I CANNOT LIFT IT UP.
NO, I CANNOT LIFT IT UP.

447
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,506
WHY DO YOU NEED TO
LIFT IT STRAIGHT UP?

448
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:18,709
BECAUSE WHEN THIS THING
SWINGS THIS WAY,

449
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:19,843
WHEN YOU PULL IT OUT,

450
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:22,112
IT'S GOING TO JUST
DESTROY THAT NOZZLE.

451
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,181
ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DO
IS HOLD YOUR HAND ON THERE

452
00:21:24,183 --> 00:21:25,449
AND WALK WITH IT
JUST LIKE...

453
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:27,451
OH, REALLY?
GO AHEAD AND DO IT, THEN.

454
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,920
TURN IT THAT WAY.
I'M TURNING IT.

455
00:21:29,922 --> 00:21:31,121
LIKE THAT.

456
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:35,793
IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN
ON YOUR HEAD, THAT ROPE.

457
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,594
JUST BE --
BE COOL, FRED.

458
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:39,864
OKAY.
WE'VE GOT IT.

459
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:44,268
IT'S CLEAR.

460
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:47,137
BE COOL.
OOP!

461
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,939
THIS [BLEEP] THING IS CAUGHT
IN THE ROPE. HOLD ON.

462
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:50,674
Narrator: A SNAG ON FRED'S

463
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,476
SAFETY ROPE IS
TIPPING THE DREDGE.

464
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,679
STOP.
STOP! ALL STOP!

465
00:21:54,681 --> 00:21:56,814
IF THE FEROCIOUS
CURRENT CATCHES IT,

466
00:21:56,816 --> 00:22:00,084
THEIR MINING SEASON
WILL BE OVER.

467
00:22:00,086 --> 00:22:02,219
GET RID OF THAT [BLEEP] ROPE,
LET IT LOOSE!

468
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:03,554
LOOK OUT!

469
00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:04,889
STOP! STOP!

470
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,299
IT'S CLEAR.

471
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:17,301
Narrator: THE DAKOTA BOYS
ARE STRUGGLING

472
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:20,036
TO GET THEIR GOLD-CATCHING
DREDGE TO THE SAFETY

473
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:21,305
OF THEIR ROCK HARBOR.

474
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:23,040
STOP! STOP!
ALL STOP!

475
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:24,842
BUT IT'S DANGEROUSLY SNAGGED.

476
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,178
STOP, STOP, STOP!

477
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,179
IT'S CAUGHT IN
THE [BLEEP] DAMN ROPE.

478
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,981
LET IT DOWN
AND I THINK WE GOT IT.

479
00:22:30,983 --> 00:22:33,517
BE COOL, FRED.

480
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,920
YOU CAN'T HOLD IT?

481
00:22:35,922 --> 00:22:39,790
LOOK AT THAT STUPID-ASS [BLEEP]
ROPE IS IN THE WAY.

482
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:41,459
CUT THAT MOTHER [BLEEP].

483
00:22:41,461 --> 00:22:42,960
I GOT IT.
I GOT IT.

484
00:22:48,468 --> 00:22:50,735
IT DIDN'T SWIVEL.

485
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:57,208
NOT TOO MUCH.
NOT TOO MUCH!

486
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,875
GOOD? WOO!

487
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,478
GOOD JOB, GUYS!

488
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,012
WOO!

489
00:23:02,014 --> 00:23:05,883
IT WAS A LITTLE BIT IFFY
WHEN IT CAME OVER THE EDGE.

490
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,018
OTHER THAN THE FACT
WE WERE FRANTIC,

491
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,419
IT WENT SMOOTH.

492
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:11,088
Dustin: OVERALL,
IT'S BEEN A GREAT DAY.

493
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,623
WE GOT A LOT DONE.

494
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:16,560
OUR DREDGE IS OVER THE TOP
OF WHERE I'M ABOUT TO DREDGE.

495
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,429
THAT IS SUPER EXCITING.

496
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:27,437
WHAT'S GOING ON, ZACK?
WHAT'S UP, DUSTIN?

497
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:29,907
WHAT HAPPENED TODAY, MAN?

498
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,909
Narrator: ZACK HAS BEEN
HAULING DUSTIN'S LUMBER

499
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:34,578
TO THE DIVE SITE ALL DAY.

500
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,247
HE'S FINALLY GETTING
A BREAK AT CAMP.

501
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,850
YOU DOING OKAY
OUT HERE?

502
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:41,719
WELL, YOU TELL ME.
I'M DOING JUST FINE,

503
00:23:41,721 --> 00:23:44,789
BUT HOW ABOUT A "THANKS, ZACK,"
OR A "GOOD JOB, ZACK,"

504
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:47,591
OR "YOU DID GOOD, I'M GLAD
YOU GOT THE BOARDS THERE"?

505
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:50,861
YOU DID A LOT OF WORK,
BUT YOU DIDN'T DO WHAT I ASKED.

506
00:23:50,863 --> 00:23:52,729
FOR YOU TO PUT THAT ON ME,
THOUGH, IS A PROBLEM,

507
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:54,465
BECAUSE I DON'T FEEL
LIKE IT'S MY FAULT.

508
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:56,800
SO DO I HAVE TO BE
MORE SPECIFIC WITH YOU?

509
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:57,935
I FEEL LIKE WE NEED --

510
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,870
OUR COMMUNICATION
HAS TO BE PERFECT.

511
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:02,272
I AGREE, AND WHEN I SAY,
"I NEED BOARDS,"

512
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,475
YOU'RE BRINGING ME BOARDS.

513
00:24:04,477 --> 00:24:06,210
WELL, THEY GOT TO YA,
DIDN'T THEY?

514
00:24:09,348 --> 00:24:11,215
WELL...

515
00:24:11,217 --> 00:24:14,417
LOOK, MAN, I'M USED TO
WORKING WITH MY GUYS.

516
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:16,620
THEY KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT I WANT WHEN I SAY IT.

517
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,088
WE SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE,

518
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:21,959
BUT I NEED YOU TO FIND
THAT AREA.

519
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:23,560
OKAY?

520
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:26,963
RIGHT.

521
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:29,299
IT'S JUST GOING TO TAKE
A LITTLE BIT OF TIME.

522
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,769
SOUNDS GOOD.

523
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:43,380
Narrator:
NEXT DAY IS THE FIRST DAY
OF DREDGING THE CREEK BED.

524
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:45,783
FRED'S EAGER TO PROVE
HIMSELF IN THE WATER.

525
00:24:45,785 --> 00:24:48,852
HE'S A GOOD DIVER.
HE'S A GREAT DIVER, ACTUALLY.

526
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:52,923
AND HE WANTS TO SHOW US
WHAT HE'S MADE OF.

527
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:56,660
I THINK I'M BETTER TRAINED
AND MORE EXPERIENCED

528
00:24:56,662 --> 00:25:00,531
TO HANDLE THIS SITUATION
THAN ANY ONE OF THE OTHERS.

529
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:04,134
Narrator:
LAST WEEK, DUSTIN FOUND PYRITE
DURING HIS TEST DRIVE.

530
00:25:04,136 --> 00:25:06,270
KNOWN AS FOOL'S GOLD,

531
00:25:06,272 --> 00:25:10,140
IT'S HEAVY AND OFTEN FOUND
ALONGSIDE GOLD.

532
00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:14,144
NOW, AFTER WEEKS OF SETBACKS,
72-YEAR-OLD FRED

533
00:25:14,146 --> 00:25:15,479
WILL DIVE WITH THE DREDGE

534
00:25:15,481 --> 00:25:19,082
FOR THE FIRST TIME
TO HUNT FOR REAL GOLD.

535
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:21,618
IT'S JUST LIKE
RIDING A BICYCLE.

536
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,688
YOU DON'T EVER FORGET.

537
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,358
Narrator: 500 TONS
OF GLACIAL MELTWATER

538
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,427
POUR THROUGH THE CREEK
EVERY MINUTE.

539
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:32,029
FRED'S LIFE WILL DEPEND

540
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:37,167
ON HIS DIVER SUPPORT SYSTEM
WORKING PERFECTLY.

541
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:39,637
THE DAKOTA BOYS
HAVE ADAPTED THEIR DREDGE

542
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:41,572
WITH A PAIR OF ON-BOARD
WATER HEATERS

543
00:25:41,574 --> 00:25:43,307
AND AIR COMPRESSORS.

544
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:49,513
THE SYSTEM FEEDS WARM WATER
INTO THE DIVER'S WET SUIT

545
00:25:49,515 --> 00:25:52,216
AND VITAL AIR TO HIS MASK.

546
00:25:57,856 --> 00:26:01,125
THEIR SET-UP IS NEW
AND COMPLETELY UNTESTED.

547
00:26:01,127 --> 00:26:02,392
I AIN'T NEVER SEEN
A HONDA

548
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,127
THAT WON'T [BLEEP] START
AND KEEP RUNNING,

549
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:07,264
AND THIS ONE WON'T EVEN
TRY TO [BLEEP] FIRE OFF.

550
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:09,533
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT IN
THE WORLD'S GOING ON DOWN THERE.

551
00:26:09,535 --> 00:26:10,935
APPARENTLY THEY'VE
HAVING SOME PROBLEMS

552
00:26:10,937 --> 00:26:13,070
PRIMING A PUMP
OR SOMETHING.

553
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:15,406
[ ENGINE STARTS ]

554
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:16,806
NOTHING'S TOTALLY PLANNED.

555
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:18,208
THERE'S NOT A CHECK LIST
GOING ON.

556
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,143
WHY WON'T THE THING
KEEP A PRIME?

557
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:21,411
I DON'T KNOW.

558
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:24,214
Narrator: CARLOS' 13 YEARS
AS A COMMERCIAL DIVER

559
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:26,350
COMBINED WITH HIS TIME
AS A MARINE

560
00:26:26,352 --> 00:26:28,551
MEAN HE'S USED TO
RIGOROUS SAFETY

561
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:31,421
AND STRICT DIVING PROTOCOLS.

562
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,757
AS FAR AS GIVING ME CONFIDENCE
OF GETTING IN THE WATER,

563
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:37,694
NOT UNTIL ALL THESE BUGS
ARE WORKED OUT.

564
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,963
Paul: I'M NOT SURE
WHAT WENT ON THERE.

565
00:26:38,965 --> 00:26:41,398
I'VE NEVER HAD A ENGINE
THAT HARD TO START.

566
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,368
MAYBE 'CAUSE IT WAS BRAND-NEW,
NEVER BEEN RUN BEFORE.

567
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:47,371
I JUST FOUND OUT THAT HOT WATER
MACHINE IS ON THE DREDGE, RIGHT?

568
00:26:47,373 --> 00:26:48,439
YEAH.
SO YOU GOT

569
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:50,040
THE HOT WATER MACHINE
ON THE DREDGE,

570
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:52,109
GOT YOUR VOL INTAKE,
YOUR AIR ON THE DREDGE.

571
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:53,243
YEAH.
SO IF THAT AIR GOES,

572
00:26:53,245 --> 00:26:54,645
THAT AIR COMES OUT
OR SOMETHING HAPPENS

573
00:26:54,647 --> 00:26:57,380
WITH THE AIR COMPRESSOR,

574
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:59,183
HOW MUCH VOLUME
DO YOU GOT TO BREATH?

575
00:26:59,185 --> 00:27:01,652
ABOUT TWO
TO THREE BREATHES.

576
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:06,523
THE COWBOY ATTITUDE
THAT THEY HAVE HERE...

577
00:27:08,594 --> 00:27:11,862
I JUST HOPE IT
KEEPS GOING THEIR WAY.

578
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:17,267
Fred:
I NEED A CARABINER OR SOMETHING
TO HOOK THAT SAFETY LINE

579
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:19,169
TO THIS THING IN THE BACK.

580
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:26,276
Narrator:
FRED STRAPS ON 60 POUNDS
OF LEAD TO STOP McKINLEY'S

581
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:29,279
LETHAL CURRENTS
DRAGGING HIM DOWNSTREAM.

582
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:37,688
THAT'S JUST FOR
THE CARABINER, YEAH.

583
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:43,693
WE HAVE...

584
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,597
ABOUT TO GET A RADIO CHECK.

585
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:01,412
Dustin:
YOU SHOULD BE GETTING SOME GOOD,
WARM WATER RIGHT NOW.

586
00:28:07,386 --> 00:28:09,253
NO, I DON'T THINK YOU'RE
GOING TO GET CONSISTENT

587
00:28:09,255 --> 00:28:10,253
OUT OF THIS [BLEEP].

588
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:12,322
YOU READY TO GO?

589
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:13,724
YEAH?
YEAH.

590
00:28:13,726 --> 00:28:15,525
OKAY.
EVERYTHING'S GOOD.

591
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,227
WE'RE GOING THIS WAY.

592
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:22,466
Dustin: ALL RIGHT.

593
00:28:22,468 --> 00:28:25,936
WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU
A QUICK COUNTDOWN.

594
00:28:25,938 --> 00:28:31,875
THREE, TWO, ONE.

595
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:33,944
GET IT, FRED.

596
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:41,018
Narrator: UP AHEAD...

597
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,886
Dustin: THERE IS NOWHERE

598
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:45,689
WHERE THE GOLD IS SITTING
ON THE SURFACE RIGHT NOW.

599
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:47,191
WE JUST FOUND IT.

600
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:11,648
Dustin: THREE, TWO, ONE.

601
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:14,218
GET IT, FRED.

602
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:19,723
Narrator: DESPERATE TO FIND GOLD
AT THEIR MINE SITE,

603
00:29:19,725 --> 00:29:23,526
72-YEAR-OLD FRED HURT
DREDGES THE DEADLY RAPIDS

604
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:25,963
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

605
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,836
I KNOW IT'S NOT YOU PULLING.

606
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,014
THE CURRENT'S TRYING
TO DRAG HIM.

607
00:29:44,016 --> 00:29:46,250
IT FEELS LIKE HE'S TRYING
TO GET AWAY FROM ME.

608
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:51,488
Dustin: WELL, YOU DO THAT.

609
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:52,755
HE WANTS IT OUT THERE.

610
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:55,225
PUSH IT OUT THERE.

611
00:30:03,102 --> 00:30:05,435
Narrator: FRED USES
THE SIX-INCH INTAKE HOSE

612
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:08,504
TO SUCK MATERIAL UP
FROM THE CREEK BED

613
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:11,174
ONTO THE FLOATING DREDGE.

614
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:14,444
THE ONBOARD SLUICE BOX
WASHES THE GRAVEL,

615
00:30:14,446 --> 00:30:17,580
CATCHING THE HEAVY GOLD
IN ITS RIFFLES.

616
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:20,116
RIGHT NOW, LOOKS LIKE HE'S
DOING PRETTY GOOD DOWN THERE.

617
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:24,187
I SEE A LOT OF BLACK MATERIAL
COMING OUT OF THE BACK OF IT.

618
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:25,989
YEAH, FRED,
YOU'RE DREDGING AGAIN, MAN.

619
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,660
WOO.

620
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:31,061
Dustin: ABOUT DAMN TIME.

621
00:30:31,063 --> 00:30:33,363
UNDERWATER, DIGGING DIRT.

622
00:30:45,277 --> 00:30:47,411
Dustin: DON'T GO INTO
THAT [BLEEP] WHITEWATER.

623
00:30:47,413 --> 00:30:49,612
THE WATER'S COMING UP RIGHT NOW.

624
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:52,983
DON'T GO FOR THE GLORY.
GO FOR SAFETY RIGHT NOW.

625
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,427
Dustin: HEY, FRED,
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOUR VENT

626
00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:05,128
ON YOUR SIDE OPENED UP.

627
00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:16,506
OKAY, YOU DON'T
HAVE ANY AIR?

628
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:18,441
AH, [BLEEP].

629
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:20,043
HEY, HE'S GOT NO AIR!

630
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,978
HEY, LET'S JUST GET HIM
OUT OF THE WATER RIGHT NOW.

631
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,780
LET'S JUST FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S GOING ON.

632
00:31:23,782 --> 00:31:25,048
ALL RIGHT,
THE VALVE'S STUCK OPEN.

633
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,451
BRINGING HIM IN.

634
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:41,664
WATCH HIS HEAD.

635
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:43,634
Dustin: WATCH YOUR HEAD, FRED.
WATCH YOUR HEAD.

636
00:31:48,807 --> 00:31:53,143
OH, IT IS GOOD TO GET AIR.

637
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:55,746

QUITE HAVE ENOUGH AIR

638
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:57,347
COMING INTO THAT MASK.

639
00:31:57,349 --> 00:31:59,549
SOMETHING -- SOMETHING'S
GOING ON WITH THAT MASK.

640
00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:01,618
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
GOING ON WITH IT.

641
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,887
WE MIGHT HAVE
SOME OF THE SILT

642
00:32:03,889 --> 00:32:07,090
BUILT UP IN THE REGULATOR
OR SOMETHING.

643
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:09,960
Dustin: HOW YOU DOING?
TAKE THE TOP OFF?

644
00:32:09,962 --> 00:32:12,496
OKAY.

645

AND SEE WHAT THE HECK
WAS GOING ON,

648
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:24,975
I DON'T THINK THAT HE WOULD BE
REALLY HAPPY AT ALL.

649
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:31,314
Dustin: MECHANICAL PROBLEM
WITH YOUR AIR FLOW,

650
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:32,582
THAT IS THE LAST THING

651
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:34,050
YOU WANT HAPPENING
WHEN YOU'RE DOWN THERE.

652
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:36,453
YOU COULD DEAL WITH GETTING COLD
AND BEING PISSED OFF.

653
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,054
LET ME CATCH MY BREATH.

654
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:40,257
GOING WITHOUT AIR
IS PRETTY HARD FOR ANYBODY.

655
00:32:42,528 --> 00:32:44,394
Carlos: THIS IS NOT
A GOT-DANG PLAYGROUND.

656
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:46,596
THIS IS --
THIS IS SCARY STUFF.

657
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:48,198
COME OVER THERE, FRED.

658
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,333

I JUST MET THE GUY.

660
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:53,870
HIS LIFE MEANS
SOMETHING TO ME.

661
00:32:53,872 --> 00:32:56,939
IT WAS A COMPLETE

662
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:59,409
COMPLETE [BLEEP]-SHOW.

663
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:04,947
I DON'T THINK THIS FRICKING
AIR COMPRESSOR'S

664
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:06,750
PUSHING TOO MUCH.

00:39:37,341 --> 00:39:39,809
MESSING WITH THE NEW GUY,
MESSING WITH THE GREENHORN,

836
00:39:39,811 --> 00:39:43,546
AND NOT
RESPECTING SOMEBODY.

837
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,548
SORRY 'BOUT YOUR SON.

838
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,584
ARE YOU?

839
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:51,821
IS THAT WHY YOU
CAN'T LOOK AT ME?

840
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:58,161
TOLD YOU THIS [BLEEP]
WOULD GET WEIRD.

841
00:39:58,163 --> 00:40:00,630
Fred: TELL YOU ONE THING
WE DON'T DO IS QUIT,

842
00:40:00,632 --> 00:40:02,499
'CAUSE WE GOT
WHAT IT TAKES!

843
00:40:02,501 --> 00:40:03,699
I DON'T CARE
WHERE YOU WERE.

844
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:06,502
YOU GOT 20 GUYS OUT THERE,
AND DURING BREAK TIME,

845
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:09,905
THEY'RE ALL JUMPING YOUR ASS
'CAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE, UH,

846
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:11,441
YOU'RE TOO [BLEEP] TALL.

847
00:40:11,443 --> 00:40:13,109
YOU'RE TOO SKINNY.

848
00:40:13,111 --> 00:40:14,511
YOU'RE TOO FAT.

849
00:40:14,513 --> 00:40:17,046
I HAVE [BLEEP] BEEN PICKED
ON ALL MY [BLEEP] LIFE.

850
00:40:17,048 --> 00:40:18,714
LOOK AT THAT BOOT,
DOWN THERE.

851
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:21,317
YOU KNOW,
PEOPLE DO THAT.

852
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:24,186
PEOPLE ARE NOT KIND.

853
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:25,588
YOU JUST HAVE
TO DEAL WITH IT.

854
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,457
IT'S LIFE.

855
00:40:27,459 --> 00:40:30,393
DUSTIN OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T
KNOW THE WORD "TACT."

856
00:40:30,395 --> 00:40:32,529
Dustin:
HOW'S THIS FOR TACT, FRED?

857
00:40:32,531 --> 00:40:33,863
I'M DONE WITH THIS
[BLEEP] ANYWAY, SO...

858
00:40:33,865 --> 00:40:34,997
Fred:
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

859
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:37,266
NO, I'M [BLEEP]
WORRIED ABOUT IT.

860
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,802
WELL, IT'S UP TO HIM.
YEAH, NO.

861
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:42,405
IT'S NOT UP TO HIM ANYMORE.
GET YOUR [BLEEP].

862
00:40:42,407 --> 00:40:45,675
GET THE [BLEEP]
OUT OF HERE, MAN.

863
00:40:45,677 --> 00:40:47,811
YEAH, THAT'S DEFINITELY
I WANT TO STAY HERE

864
00:40:47,813 --> 00:40:51,413
FOR THAT [BLEEP]
BULL [BLEEP], YEAH.

865
00:40:51,415 --> 00:40:55,752
THANKS FOR YOUR ADVICE, FRED,
BUT I'M [BLEEP] OUT OF HERE.

866
00:40:55,754 --> 00:40:58,421
I HAVE A MAJOR AMOUNT
OF RESPECT FOR FRED,

867
00:40:58,423 --> 00:41:01,758
I ALWAYS WILL,
WHICH I DO NOT HAVE FOR DUSTIN.

868
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,228
Dustin: I'D HAVE FIRED HIM
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

869
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,231
BUT I TRIED TO
GIVE HIM A CHANCE

870
00:41:08,233 --> 00:41:11,301
JUST BECAUSE OF
HIS CONNECTION WITH FRED.

871
00:41:11,303 --> 00:41:14,837
OH, THE NEW GUY COMES IN
AND I'M STILL THE [BLEEP]...

872
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:17,307
YEAH. [BLEEP] THAT.

873
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:18,708
HE'S DONE.

874
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:21,710
HE DOESN'T NEED
TO WORK HERE ANYMORE.

875
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:24,180
HE NEEDS TO GO LOGGING.

876
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:32,655
HERE WE GO.

877
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:34,591
Narrator: ON THE NEXT EPISODE...

878
00:41:34,593 --> 00:41:37,527
WOO-HOO!
THIS IS CRAZY!

879
00:41:37,529 --> 00:41:40,796
I'M TRYING TO PREVENT A PROBLEM
BEFORE IT HAPPENS, THAT'S ALL.

880
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:43,266
AAAH! STOP!

881
00:41:43,268 --> 00:41:44,467
THERE IT GOES.

882
00:41:44,469 --> 00:41:45,935
WHOA!

883
00:41:45,937 --> 00:41:47,336
I'LL BE DAMNED.

884
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,938
THERE'S A LITTLE
NUGGET IN THERE.

885
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,006
WOO-HOO-HOO!

886
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:51,341
WE ARE GOING TO BE RICH.

887
00:41:51,343 --> 00:41:53,877
CLEAN THAT SUCKER OUT!

888
00:41:53,879 --> 00:41:55,878
WAY TO GO, BUDDY!
CLEAN IT OUT.

889
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,413
GOOD JOB.
IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET BIGGER.

890
00:41:57,415 --> 00:41:58,681
IT'S ONLY GOING TO
GET BIGGER.

891
00:41:58,683 --> 00:41:59,649
WE GOT SOME GOLD.
