WHEN YOU FOUND THAT NUGGET.

FOUR WEEKS AGO, DUSTIN FOUND
A NUGGET BY THE PLUNGE POOL,

A SIGN THE ENTIRE BEND
COULD BE RICH IN GOLD.

TO CREATE A SAFE DIVING AREA

A LARGE SECTION

THAN AN OUNCE OF GOLD,

00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:45,470
TO GO BUSTING INTO
THAT DAM UPSTREAM

173
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:50,541
WHERE WE FOUND ONE NUGGET.
IT'S NOT THE WAY TO GO.

174
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,043
[BLEEP] THIS.

175
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:58,183
Narrator: TODAY, IT'S "DAKOTA"
FRED'S TURN TO DIVE.

176
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:04,422
INSTEAD OF CONTINUING
DUSTINGS UPSTREAM TUNNEL,

177
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:07,358
FRED'S GOING BACK
TO THE ORIGINAL PLAN,

178
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,160
EXPANDING THE WIDE AREA

179
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:12,263
IN THE DOWNSTREAM SECTION
OF THEIR DIVE POOL.

180
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:18,502
I APPROACH THINGS MORE LOGICAL.
I WANT TO ELIMINATE

181
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:19,904
THE FIRST POSSIBILITY

182
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,974
OF THE GOLD BEING DOWNSTREAM.

183
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:25,442
SOMETIMES, IT TAKES
A LITTLE MORE EXPLAINING

184
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:27,579
TO GET IT THROUGH
SOME THICK SKULLS

185
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:29,581
AS TO WHAT'S GOING ON.

186
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,960
FIRE IT UP.

187
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:47,398
OOH-HOO-HOO.
WOW.

188
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,335
Narrator:
DOWNSTREAM, THEY'VE ALREADY
MOVED THE WORST OF THE BOULDERS.

189
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,470
AND 10 FEET
BENEATH THE SURFACE,

190
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:57,208
FRED CAN GET STRAIGHT
INTO DREDGING FOR GOLD.

191
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,244
Fred: LET ME WARM
THIS SUIT UP.

192
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:08,953
HEY. I'M GONNA SHOW YOU
FELLAS HOW IT'S DONE.

193
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:23,568
UH, WE GOT FRED DOWN.

194
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:24,969
HE SEEMS TO BE
DIGGING IT RIGHT.

195
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:28,906
HE'S DIGGING COMPLETE
OPPOSITE WAY OF EVERYONE ELSE.

196
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:31,775
FRED DECIDED, UH,
HE KNOWS BETTER.

197
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:35,880
SO HE'S DIGGING THAT DIRECTION,
I THINK, DOWNCREEK.

198
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:24,295
OH, I CAN'T WAIT TO SIT DOWN
AND LOOK IN THAT BOX,

199
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:26,698
SEE WHAT'S IN THERE.

200
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:34,639
Narrator:
SUBMERGED IN THE 38-DEGREE
WATER FOR FOUR HOURS,

201
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:36,574
FRED HAS RUN NEARLY SIX YARDS

202
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:38,576
OF MATERIAL THROUGH THE DREDGE.

203
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,383
COPY THAT.
YOU'RE COMING UP.

204
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,657
THAT WAS A LONG
DIVE TODAY, FRED.

205
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:54,859
I THINK WE NAILED THAT ONE.

206
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:55,827
HIT THE POWER.

207
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,332
LET'S SEE WHAT
WE GOT IN THE BOX.

208
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:07,472
I DON'T SEE ANY GOLD.

209
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:09,807
[BLEEP].
NOTHING.

210
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:11,476
THAT'S NOT WHAT
I WANTED TO SEE.

211
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:13,611
NO.
LET'S LOOK UP AT THE TOP.

212
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:17,748
WHAT YOU GOT?

213
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,752
NO GOLD. NO GOLD.
NO GOLD.

214
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:24,221
I DON'T SEE ANY NUGGETS.
WHICH WE MAY NOT...

215
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:26,090
WE'RE STILL NOT
IN THE RIGHT SPOT.

216
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,559
I THINK WE NEED
TO BE FURTHER UPSTREAM.

217
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:32,429
I GUESS IT'S SLOWER
GOING THAN I THOUGHT.

218
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,565
OH, WELL.

219
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:37,301
Dustin: FRED AND I ARGUED
AND BITCHED ABOUT WHAT TO DO.

220
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:38,702
AND HE JUST COULDN'T
LISTEN, MAN.

221
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:40,705
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

222
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:43,074
I'VE WASTED A LOT
OF TIME ON THIS.

223
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:48,779
I WON'T BE WASTING
ANY MORE TIME.

224
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:52,116
I CAME UP WITH A PLAN.
AND WE'RE STICKING TO IT.

225
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:56,921
Narrator:
THE CREW HAS NOTHING TO SHOW
FOR A DAY'S DIVING.

226
00:15:56,923 --> 00:16:00,224
ALL MINING FROM NOW
ON WILL FOCUS UPSTREAM.

227
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:28,152
HOLY [BLEEP].

228
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,891
NOT SURE WHAT'S GOING ON.

229
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:36,294
LAST FEW TIMES IT RAINED,
IT DIDN'T DO THIS.

230
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:41,566
LOOKS PRETTY BAD.
I GUESS THAT RAIN DID A LOT.

231
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:43,835
Narrator: OVERNIGHT, HEAVY RAIN
IN THE MOUNTAINS

232
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:48,039
HAS RAISED THE LEVEL
OF THE CREEK BY THREE FEET.

233
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,041
Carlos: LOOK HOW FAST THAT
WATER'S MOVING, MAN.

234
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:52,843
THAT'S FAST-MOVING
WATER RIGHT THERE.

235
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,111
IT'S JUST THIS [BLEEP]
DANG CREEK

236
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:55,980
DON'T WANT US HERE, MAN.

237
00:16:55,982 --> 00:17:00,051
AND TODAY, IT'S CARLOS'
TURN TO DIVE.

238
00:17:00,053 --> 00:17:03,120
MY MAIN CONCERN IS THAT
[BLEEP] DANG DIVERSION WALL.

239
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:07,325
IF IT BREAKS, IT'S GONNA
CAUSE A LOT OF PAIN,

240
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:11,462
BRO, A LOT OF PAIN.

241
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:15,600
THIS IS A LITTLE BIT
BEAUCOUP UNNERVING, BROTHER.

242
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:17,268
Dustin:
STUFF'S ANGRY, AIN'T IT?

243
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,537
THAT'S VERY,
VERY ANGRY, MAN.

244
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,140
HOW YOU FEELING ABOUT THAT?

245
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:23,474
I'M JUST WONDERING,
WHAT DO YOU THINK

246
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:25,343
ABOUT THAT DIVERSION
HOLDING THROUGH?

247
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:27,412
IT'S A HIGH-RISK
SITUATION RIGHT NOW.

248
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,415
CARLOS, I'M NOT SURE
HOW COMFORTABLE I AM

249
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,417
WITH YOU GOING
DOWN THERE TODAY.

250
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:34,752
WE MAY...
I -- I'M NOT SURE

251
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:36,621
HOW COMFORTABLE I AM
WITH ANYBODY PUTTING THAT --

252
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:39,824
PUTTING THAT DREDGE IN,
DUDE.

253
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:42,292
I WON'T PUT YOU
IN A SITUATION

254
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:44,695
THAT I WOULDN'T
PUT MYSELF IN.

255
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:48,232
I CAN DIG IN THAT.

256
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:51,102
Narrator: WATER IS NOW CRASHING
DOWN THE CREEK

257
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:55,772
AT OVER 8,000 GALLONS A SECOND.

258
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:58,242
Dustin: IT'S DANGEROUS.

259
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:02,913
BUT I DON'T KNOW FOR ME
TO BE WEIRDED OUT BY IT.

260
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:08,653
Narrator:
DUSTIN'S DETERMINED TO CONTINUE
TUNNELING BENEATH THE DIVERSION.

261
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:09,921
Dustin: GOT TO GET IN
THE MIND SET

262
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:12,590
EVERY HOUR COUNTS,
EVERY ROCK COUNTS.

263
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:15,593
I MEAN, IT DOESN'T STOP.

264
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:16,994
OH.

265
00:18:16,996 --> 00:18:19,397
HOLY MOLY.
THIS THING'S STRONG, DUDE.

266
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:20,464
YEAH.

267
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:21,933
[BLEEP]

268
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:27,071
IT'S STRONG RIGHT NOW.

269
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:29,807
CURRENT IS VERY,
VERY STRONG.

270
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:32,610
YOU FALL IN THIS THING
RIGHT HERE, JUST FALL DOWN.

271
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:36,948
WE'RE READY TO GO.

272
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,493
JUST BE CAREFUL DOWN THERE.

273
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:51,495
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE BOULDER
SITUATION'S LIKE NOW.

274
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,331
HEY, DUSTIN!

275
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,201
WHAT?

276
00:19:30,203 --> 00:19:31,402
WHOA.

277
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,938
Carlos:
WATER'S GETTING DIRTIER.

278
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:38,275
THE WATER'S GETTING DIRTIER.

279
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:39,243
I KNOW.

280
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:42,547
YEAH.

281
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:45,215
IT'S GETTING DARKER
BY THE MINUTE.

282
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,718
YEAH.

283
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:54,358
Dustin: IT'S NOW GOT REALLY,
REALLY DIRTY HERE.

284
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:22,086
♪♪

285
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:36,867
Narrator:
IN MCKINLEY CREEK, THE WATER
HAS SUDDENLY CHANGED COLOR,

286
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:39,403
INDICATING AN EVENT UPSTREAM.

287
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:46,210
THE CREW HAS NO CHOICE
BUT TO EVACUATE.

288
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:55,019
WHAT'S THAT?

289
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:59,890
ALL RIGHT.
GO AHEAD, MAN.

290
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:01,092
YEAH, MAN.
WE GOT TO GO.

291
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:02,826
WE GOT TO GO ACROSS THE BRIDGE.

292
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:05,296
WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.

293
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,434
Dustin: SO WE HAD TO BACK OUT.

294
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:12,769
LOOKING PRETTY BAD.

295
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:16,106
RATHER SAFE THAN DEAD.
YEAH.

296
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,909
THAT THING HAS TOTALLY TURNED
TO CHOCOLATE MILK OUT THERE.

297
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:20,577
BUT IT IS NOT
GOOD RIGHT NOW.

298
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:23,980
IT IS NASTY LOOKING.

299
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:26,917
I'M LOOKING FOR TREES
AND DEBRIS,

300
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:29,853
OR, UH, A DRAMATIC
DROP IN THE WATER.

301
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:32,389
THAT MEANS BAD,
BAD STUFF FOR US.

302
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:35,392
I WENT FROM BEING ABLE
TO SEE TO ABSOLUTE BLACKNESS.

303
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,261
I'M -- I'M USED TO NOT
BEING ABLE TO SEE.

304
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:39,996
BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN THE CREEK

305
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:42,132
CHANGE SO DRAMATICALLY SO QUICK.

306
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:45,202
IT SCARES THE HELL OUT OF ME.

307
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:46,536
LET'S GO.

308
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:48,406
Narrator:
WITH LIVES ON THE LINE,

309
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:51,776
DUSTIN CANCELS DIVING
FOR THE REST OF THE DAY.

310
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,613
Dustin: I'M GONNA WAIT UNTIL
THE DANGER IS OVER WITH

311
00:21:55,615 --> 00:21:57,515
BEFORE WE GET BACK
IN THAT WATER.

312
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,289
Narrator:
THE ONLY WAY TO INVESTIGATE

313
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:09,893
WHAT HAPPENED UPSTREAM
IS BY AIR.

314
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,429
HOW YOU DOING THERE, JACK?

315
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:13,030
HELLO, GENTLEMEN.
HOW ARE YOU?

316
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:14,831
ALL RIGHT.
GOOD TO SEE YOU, MAN.

317
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,167
THANKS FOR ACCOMMODATING US.

318
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:18,703
YOU BET YOU.

319
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:32,916
ALL RIGHT.
SO I WAS DIVING.

320
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:35,719
AND THE WHOLE CREEK WENT BLACK.

321
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,388
SO WE KIND OF FEEL LIKE

322
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:39,590
THERE'S SOMETHING
HAPPENING UPCREEK

323
00:22:39,592 --> 00:22:40,858
FROM US RIGHT NOW.

324
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,394
AND I DON'T KNOW
HOW DANGEROUS IT IS.

325
00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:51,068
Fred: WELL, WE'RE ABOUT HALF
A MILE UP THE CREEK, AREN'T WE?

326
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:55,473
THERE'S OUR WALKWAY RIGHT THERE.
YEP.

327
00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:57,875
LOOKS LIKE EVERYTHING'S
STILL IN PLACE.

328
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:06,417
Fred:
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT UP THERE?

329
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:07,351
WHERE'S THE RIVER?

330
00:23:07,353 --> 00:23:10,421
WHERE'S THE CREEK?
LANDSLIDE.

331
00:23:10,423 --> 00:23:14,158
IT'S COMPLETELY
ACROSS THE CREEK.

332
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,894
HOLY COW.
OH.

333
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:19,096
OH, WOW.
NO WAY.

334
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:21,232
LOOK AT THIS, MAN.

335
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:22,566
THAT WHOLE THING
CAME DOWN OFF

336
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,034
THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN
RIGHT THERE.

337
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:26,236
WOW.

338
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,639
WHAT WE'RE SEEING
RIGHT NOW,

339
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:31,708
THE WATER'S RUNNING UNDERNEATH
THIS LANDSLIDE, RIGHT?

340
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,778
SO IF THIS THING CLOGS UP,

341
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,647
THEN THERE'S A POTENTIAL
WE COULD GET, UH, LIKE, UH...

342
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:39,583
BIG COLLAPSE.
INLAND TSUNAMI.

343
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:44,054
Narrator: A MASSIVE LANDSLIDE
HAS COVERED THE CREEK.

344
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:46,190
THE WATER IS RUNNING BENEATH

345
00:23:46,192 --> 00:23:49,527
IN A 200-YARD-LONG TUNNEL.

346
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:52,263
AT ANY TIME,
THIS COULD COLLAPSE,

347
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:53,530
DAMMING THE CREEK

348
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:57,401
AND TRAPPING MILLIONS
OF GALLONS OF WATER.

349
00:23:57,403 --> 00:23:59,803
IF THE DAM SUDDENLY BREAKS,

350
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:01,004
A FAST-MOVING TIDAL

351
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:03,206
WAVE WILL RACE DOWN THE CANYON

352
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:06,276
TOWARDS THE MINE SITE,

353
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:11,348
OBLITERATING ANYTHING
AND EVERYONE

354
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:13,817
IN ITS PATH.

355
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:17,287
Dustin:
IF THIS COMES OVER THE TOP
OF THAT AND BUSTS THROUGH,

356
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:20,491
IT WILL KICK OUR ASS.

357
00:24:20,493 --> 00:24:22,026
I THINK WHAT WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO DO, REALLY,

358
00:24:22,028 --> 00:24:26,096
IS ADVANCE INTO THE WATER
WITH, LIKE, EXTREME PREJUDICE.

359
00:24:26,098 --> 00:24:30,100
IT DROPS DOWN TWO INCHES,
EVERYBODY OUT, NO EXCEPTIONS.

360
00:24:41,113 --> 00:24:45,048
Narrator:
TWO HOURS LATER, THE WATER
COLOR HAS RETURNED TO NORMAL.

361
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,318
BUT DUSTIN IS SO CONCERNED

362
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,120
BY THE THREAT
OF A CATASTROPHIC FLOOD,

363
00:24:50,122 --> 00:24:55,092
HE CALLS OFF DIVING TO INSTALL
A NEW EMERGENCY ESCAPE ROPE.

364
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,598
Dustin: EVERY MINING CREW
THAT'S EVER BEEN HERE

365
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,600
HAS BEEN WASHED OUT BY THE RAIN

366
00:25:02,602 --> 00:25:04,802
AND THE FLOODS,
EVERY ONE OF THEM.

367
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:07,671
THERE'S NO EXCEPTIONS.

368
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:12,342
OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM
IS WE'RE TRAPPED.

369
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,611
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH
GOLD DOWN THERE

370
00:25:13,613 --> 00:25:16,046
FOR SOMEBODY TO DIE.

371
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:20,885
ALL RIGHT, FELLAS,
HUDDLE UP REAL QUICK.

372
00:25:20,887 --> 00:25:23,020
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.

373
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:25,155
WE'VE GOT
AN EVACUATION PLAN.

374
00:25:25,157 --> 00:25:27,157
UH, THERE'S THE ROPE
THAT GOES UP.

375
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:28,425
WE GOT TO SCRAMBLE UP THIS --

376
00:25:28,427 --> 00:25:30,628
THIS BIG CLIFF RIGHT HERE.

377
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:33,830
IF THE WATER CHANGES
TWO INCHES IN FIVE MINUTES,

378
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,832
I AM YANKING
EVERYBODY OUT.

379
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:38,902
AND THEY WILL BE
RUNNING UP A HILL.

380
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:40,237
YOU'RE GOING UP THERE.

381
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:41,438
AND YOU'RE GONNA
GET UP THERE FAST.

382
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,573
I DON'T CARE HOW OLD
OR TIRED YOU ARE.

383
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:45,575
YOU'RE JUST GETTING UP
THAT HILL.

384
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:47,177
MOTHER NATURE IS IN CONTROL.

385
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:49,246
AND WE'RE JUST TRYING
TO READ THE SIGNS.

386
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,451
WE'RE ON HIGH ALERT.

387
00:25:54,453 --> 00:25:56,053
SOMETHING'S UP THERE
STALKING IT.

388
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:59,390
IT'S BEEN FILLING UP
FOR TWO DAYS.

389
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:00,991
AND IT COMES THROUGH,
WE'RE ALL DEAD.

390
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:02,927
EVERYONE'S DEAD.

391
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,367
Narrator:
THE NEXT DAY, THERE'S BEEN
NO CHANGE IN THE WATER LEVEL.

392
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:14,270
DUSTIN CAN SAFELY RESUME

393
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:19,142
HIS DIVE PLAN TO TUNNEL
BENEATH THE DIVERSION.

394
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:22,212
WE'RE GONNA GO BACK DIVING.

395
00:26:22,214 --> 00:26:24,348
I GOT HIGH HOPES, MAN.
THIS IS CRAZY.

396
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:27,017
IT MIGHT BE A CHANCE
TO MAKE GOLD TODAY.

397
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:29,153
ALL HE'S GOT TO DO
IS GO DEEP ENOUGH.

398
00:26:57,683 --> 00:26:58,983
Carlos: THERE'S CURRENT
COMING UNDERNEATH

399
00:26:58,985 --> 00:27:00,784
THAT GOD DANG DIVERSION.

400
00:27:03,522 --> 00:27:05,055
YOU CAN SEE IT
BUBBLING UP RIGHT THERE.

401
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:06,991
YOU CAN SEE IT BUBBLING UP.

402
00:27:06,993 --> 00:27:08,258
YEAH. I DON'T THINK
OUR DIVERSION

403
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,994
IS DOING TOO MUCH RIGHT NOW.

404
00:27:36,689 --> 00:27:38,488
Narrator: UP AHEAD...

405
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,691
THERE'S ACTUALLY SOMETHING IN
THERE THAT LOOKS LIKE A NUGGET.

406
00:27:40,693 --> 00:27:43,427
IT'S BRIGHTER THAN
EVERYTHING ELSE.

407
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:46,362
IT'S SHINY.
YEAH!

408
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:48,098
Dustin: A LOT OF ROCKS
AND A LOT OF DIRT TODAY.

409
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,668
IT'S PROBABLY
OUR BEST DAY YET.

410
00:28:02,248 --> 00:28:05,315
♪♪

411
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:20,697
Narrator: DUSTIN HAS UNDERMINED
THE DIVERSION

412
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:23,333
WHILE DIGGING HIS TUNNEL.

413
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:26,203
THE BOARDS BECAME LOOSE
AND BROKE FREE,

414
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:29,840
ALLOWING THE FIERCE CURRENT
TO RUSH INTO THEIR DIVE POOL.

415
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:33,343
IT LOOKS PRETTY BAD
FROM UP HERE

416
00:28:33,345 --> 00:28:36,546
BECAUSE IT'S
BOILING UP EVERYWHERE.

417
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,881
ALL RIGHT.
HERE COMES PAUL.

418
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:40,083
HE'S COMING ALL THE WAY
TO THE MIDDLE NOW.

419
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:40,984
ALL RIGHT.

420
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:03,040
ALL RIGHT. HE'S POUNDING THAT
FIRST ONE IN.

421
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,317
GOT AS MANY OF THOSE
BOARDS KNOCKED DOWN

422
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:14,752
AS THAT WOULD GO DOWN.
ALL RIGHT.

423
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:24,061
YEAH.

424
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:29,600
YEAH.
THAT'LL BE GOOD.

425
00:29:39,812 --> 00:29:42,212
Dustin: UH, YEAH.
THE CURRENT WAS SO STRONG.

426
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:43,747
I'D REACH OUT AND GRAB
ONE OF THE BOARDS,

427
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:45,482
AND MY FEET WOULD
STICK STRAIGHT OUT

428
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:47,818
BEHIND ME LIKE SUPERMAN.

429
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,087
IT JUST STARTED WEARING ME
OUT WITH THE CURRENT

430
00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:51,822
AND, UH, BREATHING REALLY HARD.

431
00:29:51,824 --> 00:29:54,691
I COULD FEEL IT JUST
KICK MY BUTT.

432
00:29:57,295 --> 00:30:01,698
Narrator:
PAUL HAS CALMED THE WATER
BY FIXING THE DIVERSION.

433
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,835
HE CAN NOW EXCAVATE THE SITE.

434
00:30:04,837 --> 00:30:07,104
Paul:
I'VE GOT GOOD, CLEAR WATER,
PROBABLY THE CLEAREST WATER

435
00:30:07,106 --> 00:30:09,439
I'VE SEEN SO FAR
SINCE I'VE BEEN DIVING HERE.

436
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:10,841
BUT IF I CAN GET
UNDERNEATH THAT DIVERSION,

437
00:30:10,843 --> 00:30:13,109
SEE IF WE CAN'T GET UP
TO WHERE DUSTIN WAS AT,

438
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:14,044
THINK WE'LL DO
PRETTY GOOD TODAY.

439
00:30:14,046 --> 00:30:15,179
WE'LL GET SOME GOLD.

440
00:30:15,181 --> 00:30:17,314
THANK YOU.

441
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:19,983
IF YOU VALUE YOUR PINKIES,
YOU'LL FIND ME SOME GOLD.

442
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:23,120
[ LAUGHS ]

443
00:30:23,122 --> 00:30:24,921
Dustin: ALL HE'S GOT TO DO
IS GO DEEP ENOUGH

444
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:29,393
AND FAR ENOUGH UPSTREAM,
AND WE'LL GET GOLD.

445
00:30:29,395 --> 00:30:30,260
LOOKS GOOD?
YEP.

446
00:30:30,262 --> 00:30:33,863
YOU LOOK GOOD.

447
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:36,667
RIGHT NOW, WE'RE JUST
WORKING TOWARDS UPCREEK.

448
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:38,468
WE'RE NOT SURE
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN

449
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:41,138
WHEN WE REACH THAT
DIVERSION RIGHT THERE.

450
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,072
ONCE WE GET UP TO THAT POINT,

451
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:46,410
WE'VE NEVER ACTUALLY
DONE THAT BEFORE.

452
00:30:46,412 --> 00:30:49,212
BUT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS
TO GET AS DEEP AS WE CAN

453
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:50,480
AND AS FAR UPCREEK

454
00:30:50,482 --> 00:30:52,683
AS WE CAN TO SEE HOW THIS GOES.

455
00:30:58,891 --> 00:31:00,524
YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT SPOT.

456
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:10,100
COMING UP.

457
00:31:10,102 --> 00:31:13,169
Narrator: AN HOUR INTO THE DIVE,
PAUL HAS DUG DEEP ENOUGH

458
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:16,373
TO BEGIN DREDGING
BENEATH THE DIVERSION,

459
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:20,911
CLOSE TO WHERE DUSTIN
FOUND THE NUGGET.

460
00:31:20,913 --> 00:31:22,779
IN THESE POCKETS
THAT ARE DOWN THERE,

461
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:25,582
WE HOPE CARRY SOME SORT OF GOLD.

462
00:31:29,989 --> 00:31:32,122
PAUL'S MOVING A LOT
OF DIRT TODAY,

463
00:31:32,124 --> 00:31:34,590
ESPECIALLY IN THE RIGHT SPOT.

464
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:36,526
IT'S WHAT GOLD MINING'S
ALL ABOUT.

465
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:43,600
HEY, THERE'S ACTUALLY
SOMETHING IN THERE

466
00:31:43,602 --> 00:31:44,668
THAT LOOKS LIKE A NUGGET.

467
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,837
IT'S BRIGHTER THAN
EVERYTHING ELSE.

468
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:51,808
HOLD ON.
HOLD ON.

469
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:52,876
I THINK FRED IS SAYING

470
00:31:52,878 --> 00:31:56,046
THAT THE STUFF
IN THE BOX LOOKS BRIGHT.

471
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,550
IT'S SHINY.

472
00:32:00,552 --> 00:32:02,953
HE'S SAYING THAT
IT LOOKS LIKE GOLD.

473
00:32:02,955 --> 00:32:04,321
Paul: YEAH!

474
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,826
Narrator:
AFTER 5 HOURS OF DREDGING,

475
00:32:09,828 --> 00:32:14,698
PAUL HAS RUN EIGHT YARDS
OF PAY THROUGH THE SLUICE.

476
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:18,035
MOVED A LOT OF ROCKS
AND A LOT OF DIRT TODAY.

477
00:32:18,037 --> 00:32:19,803
IT'S PROBABLY OUR BEST DAY YET.

478
00:32:22,174 --> 00:32:25,242
UNFORTUNATELY,
IT'S JUST A ROCK.

479
00:32:25,244 --> 00:32:27,678
Dustin: CLEANOUT.

480
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:34,584
HOW YOU DOING, MAN?

481
00:32:34,586 --> 00:32:37,054
GOOD DIVE.

482
00:32:39,992 --> 00:32:44,661
Narrator: THE CREW PULLS
THE MATS FOR A CLEANUP.

483
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:46,763
HOLY MOLY.
THAT'S A LOT OF GRAVEL, BRO.

484
00:32:59,878 --> 00:33:01,011
Wes: YEAH.
THIS IS ALL THE MATERIAL

485
00:33:01,013 --> 00:33:03,814
THAT CAME OUT
OF THE DREDGE ITSELF.

486
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:05,548
IF WE PICKED UP ANY GOLD
OVER THESE FEW DAYS,

487
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:08,485
IT'LL BE IN HERE.

488
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,019
THERE'S A LITTLE BIT
OF GOLD IN THE SLUICE.

489
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:12,222
AND WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD
AND TAKE IT BACK TO PAN IT.

490
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:20,363
Narrator:
THEIR GOLD TOTAL SO FAR
IS JUST OVER HALF AN OUNCE.

491
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:22,899
TO BREAK EVEN BEFORE
THE END OF THE SEASON,

492
00:33:22,901 --> 00:33:25,002
THEY NEED 42.

493
00:33:36,782 --> 00:33:39,849
BACK AT CAMP,
WES CLEANS UP THE GOLD

494
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:43,319
FROM THE UPSTREAM SECTION
OF THE DIVE POOL.

495
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:44,788
Wes: WELL, I'VE GOT ALL OF

496
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,723
OUR SEASON'S GOLD
IN THIS CAN SO FAR.

497
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:49,860
THAT'S EVERYTHING THAT
WE'VE COLLECTED UP TILL NOW.

498
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:52,829
I'M GONNA TAKE OUT AND, UH,
LET THE GUYS SEE IT.

499
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,404
Fred: COOL EVENINGS LIKE THIS,

500
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:04,074
GREAT TO HAVE
A LITTLE FIRE OUT THERE.

501
00:34:04,076 --> 00:34:06,276
HEY, LOOK. HEY.
WHAT'S HAPPENING, VOLE?

502
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:08,411
WELL, I GOT OUR TOTAL
FOR EVERYTHING

503
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:10,080
THAT WE'VE DONE
SO FAR FOR THE YEAR.

504
00:34:10,082 --> 00:34:12,615
WHAT YOU GOT GOING?
THAT'S IT RIGHT THERE.

505
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:15,352
OH, LORD.

506
00:34:15,354 --> 00:34:16,620
LITTLE UNDER AN OUNCE,
PROBABLY.

507
00:34:16,622 --> 00:34:18,355
ABOUT THREE QUARTERS.

508
00:34:18,357 --> 00:34:21,190
WOW, PRETTY SAD.

509
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:25,095
