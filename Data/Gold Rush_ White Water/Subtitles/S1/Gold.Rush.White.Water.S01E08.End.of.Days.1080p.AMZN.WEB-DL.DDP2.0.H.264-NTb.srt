BET IT'S NOT WORTH
5 FOOT DEEP RIGHT THERE.

678
00:38:09,133 --> 00:38:11,667
YEAH, I BET YOU'RE RIGHT.

679
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:18,067
Narrator: IT TOOK 4 MONTHS
TO DIG DOWN TO BEDROCK GOLD.

680
00:38:18,067 --> 00:38:20,100
BUT NOW, IN 5 MINUTES,

681
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:23,300
THEIR DIVERSION
HAS BEEN BLOWN AWAY.

682
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:25,467
THE STORM'S AFTERMATH
AND TORRENT

683
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,700
HAVE REFILLED THEIR HOLE.

684
00:38:27,733 --> 00:38:29,800
GAME OVER.

685
00:38:29,833 --> 00:38:33,067
Dustin: SORRY, GUYS.
I KNOW WE WERE CLOSE.

686
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,167
BUT, UH, THIS IS DONE, MAN.

687
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,633
WE'RE DONE.

688
00:38:36,667 --> 00:38:38,467
WE AIN'T GONNA BE
DOING NO MORE WORK.

689
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,800
Carlos: YOU CAN'T MAKE UP
THIS KINDA [BLEEP] DUDE.

690
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:44,733
SWEAT AND BLOOD
FOR GOLD, FIND GOLD.

691
00:38:44,767 --> 00:38:46,900
THE RIVER TAKES IT AWAY.

692
00:38:46,933 --> 00:38:49,100
Dustin: ONE MINUTE,
THERE'S BEDROCK.

693
00:38:49,133 --> 00:38:51,467
THE NEXT MINUTE,
EVERYTHING'S GONE.

694
00:38:56,733 --> 00:38:58,933
IT'S A HORRIBLE WAY
TO END THE SEASON.

695
00:38:58,967 --> 00:39:01,333
WE SHOULD BE ENDING
THE SEASON ROLLING IN GOLD.

696
00:39:01,367 --> 00:39:06,367
BUT, INSTEAD, ALL OF
OUR WORK GOT WIPED OUT.

697
00:39:09,733 --> 00:39:14,200
Narrator: WES HAS ONE LAST
SURPRISE FOR DUSTIN.

698
00:39:14,233 --> 00:39:16,467
Wes: MAN, DUDE,
CHECK THIS OUT.

699
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,133
THAT'S FROM THAT
DIVE THAT FRED DID

700
00:39:18,167 --> 00:39:20,600
BEFORE WE GOT FLOODED OUT.
LOOK AT THAT.

701
00:39:20,633 --> 00:39:22,233
Dustin: NICE TO KNOW THAT
THERE'S BIG CHUNKY

702
00:39:22,267 --> 00:39:23,667
GOLD SITTING DOWN THERE.

703
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,500
WE WERE RIGHT
THERE ON IT, MAN.

704
00:39:25,533 --> 00:39:27,300
CHECK THIS OUT, GUYS.
DAMN.

705
00:39:27,333 --> 00:39:28,567
WOW.
YOU WERE THERE.

706
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,233
WE WERE THERE.
WE FOUND IT.

707
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:31,933
I THINK THAT WAS ONLY,
LIKE, 30 MINUTES.

708
00:39:31,967 --> 00:39:34,167
IF WE HEADED TO A PLACE
WHERE WE COULD DIG IN THAT

709
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,067
BOTTOM EVERY DAY,

710
00:39:36,067 --> 00:39:37,800
YOU FOLLOW
THAT GOLD STREAK,

711
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:40,700
WE SHOULD HAVE 10 OF THESE
FULL OF GOLD, MAN.

712
00:39:40,733 --> 00:39:43,567
-YEAH, WE'D HAVE KILLED IT.
-HOW'D IT LOOK OVERALL?

713
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,467
UH, LET ME GRAB IT.

714
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,433
GOOD JOB, GUYS.
THAT'S FREAKING AWESOME, BRO.

715
00:39:48,467 --> 00:39:49,933
THAT'S FREAKING
BEAUTIFUL, BRO.

716
00:39:49,967 --> 00:39:52,067
Richardson: WE'RE CLOSE, MAN.
WE'RE CLOSE.

717
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,533
BEAUTIFUL.

718
00:39:55,233 --> 00:39:56,800
Narrator: ADDING
TO THIS WEEK'S CHUNKY

719
00:39:56,833 --> 00:39:58,933
BEDROCK GOLD,

720
00:39:58,967 --> 00:40:02,500
THE CREW SEES THE FRUITS
OF THEIR SEASON'S LABOR,

721
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:07,700
MORE THAN HALF OF WHICH
THEY MADE IN THE LAST FEW DAYS.

722
00:40:07,733 --> 00:40:11,133
TWO AND A HALF OUNCES.

723
00:40:11,167 --> 00:40:12,967
TWO AND A HALF OUNCES,

724
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,367
WORTH JUST $3,000

725
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,967
BUT PROOF THEY WERE
ON THE VERGE OF MILLIONS.

726
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,933
I KNOW IT'S NOT THAT IMPRESSIVE.
BUT WE GOT TO THE GOLD.

727
00:40:22,967 --> 00:40:26,133
BUT WE DIDN'T RETRIEVE
ALL OF IT YET.

728
00:40:26,167 --> 00:40:29,400
IT'S A SAD THING THAT WE
DIDN'T GET RICH THIS YEAR.

729
00:40:29,433 --> 00:40:31,133
Fred:
BITTERSWEET, YOU KNOW.

730
00:40:31,167 --> 00:40:32,900
HEY,
BUT THE MAIN THING HERE --

731
00:40:32,933 --> 00:40:36,333
WHATEVER IS DONE THERE
IS STILL THERE.

732
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:38,000
WE NEED TO COME BACK
AND GET IT.

733
00:40:38,033 --> 00:40:39,667
WE'LL GET IT
NEXT YEAR, FOR SURE.

734
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:43,133
WELL, I WILL BE STARTING MY
CONSTRUCTION JOB FOR THE WINTER.

735
00:40:43,167 --> 00:40:47,167
AND I HOPE TO MAKE
ENOUGH MONEY TO START OVER.

736
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,167
ANYBODY FEEL LIKE COMING BACK,
EVEN THOUGH WE GOT 2 1/2 OUNCES?

737
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,933
NOW THAT WE SEE THE GOLD'S
GETTING BIGGER AND CHUNKIER,

738
00:40:52,967 --> 00:40:54,367
I'LL BE HERE.

739
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,667
I'LL COME BACK.
YEAH, YOU'VE BEEN A REALLY,

740
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:00,433
REALLY GOOD PART
OF THIS GROUP, MAN.

741
00:41:00,467 --> 00:41:02,433
I'LL COME BACK...

742
00:41:02,467 --> 00:41:05,367
ON MY OWN TERMS.

743
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,867
OUR GOLD
IS STILL THERE, BOYS.

744
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,267
AT LEAST WE KNOW IT'S SAFE
DOWN -- DOWN THERE, RIGHT?

745
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:14,067
WE KNOW THAT THERE'S
GOLD DOWN THERE.

746
00:41:14,067 --> 00:41:17,067
WE'RE NOT JUST HOPEFUL.
WE KNOW IT.

747
00:41:17,067 --> 00:41:18,567
WE'VE PROVEN THAT THERE

748
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,767
IS GOLD DOWN THERE
AND A LOT OF IT.

749
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,133
WE JUST HAVEN'T
GOT TO IT YET.

750
00:41:24,167 --> 00:41:26,367
AH, SO CLOSE.

751
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:33,667
