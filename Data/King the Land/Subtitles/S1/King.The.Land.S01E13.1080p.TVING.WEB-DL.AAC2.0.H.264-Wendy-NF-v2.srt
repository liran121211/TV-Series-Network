1
00:00:48,589 --> 00:00:52,036
KING THE LAND

2
00:00:52,449 --> 00:00:54,062
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:54,143 --> 00:00:55,882
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:56,233 --> 00:00:58,319
- Goodness.
- Dad.

5
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:03,741
Oh.

6
00:01:03,824 --> 00:01:05,034
Let us serve the meal.

7
00:01:05,117 --> 00:01:06,160
Yes, sure.

8
00:01:43,197 --> 00:01:44,573
It's Ms. Best Talent.

9
00:01:44,657 --> 00:01:46,158
It's been a while.

10
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:51,664
Hello, have you been well, sir?

11
00:01:52,623 --> 00:01:54,959
If she's titled the Best Talent,

12
00:01:55,042 --> 00:01:57,128
she must be very talented.

13
00:01:59,839 --> 00:02:00,756
Not at all.

14
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,925
He's just being generous.

15
00:02:03,676 --> 00:02:06,095
Then let us serve the soup first.

16
00:02:06,595 --> 00:02:09,015
It's already been decided,
so there's no need to drag this out.

17
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,392
Won, now that your position is settled,

18
00:02:11,475 --> 00:02:13,602
marry Yu-ri within the year
before it's too late.

19
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,602
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

20
00:02:57,438 --> 00:02:58,481
Are you hurt?

21
00:02:58,564 --> 00:02:59,440
Are you okay?

22
00:02:59,523 --> 00:03:00,775
I'm sorry.

23
00:03:00,858 --> 00:03:02,485
I'm asking if you're okay.

24
00:03:04,528 --> 00:03:05,571
What?

25
00:03:13,996 --> 00:03:15,414
Yes, I'm fine.

26
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,709
It's dangerous, so step away.
I'll clean it.

27
00:03:18,793 --> 00:03:20,252
No, I'll do it, sir.

28
00:03:21,504 --> 00:03:22,713
I'll do it.

29
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,801
My apologies, sir.

30
00:03:26,884 --> 00:03:28,052
Allow me to do it.

31
00:03:28,135 --> 00:03:30,096
- Sa-rang, you may leave.
- No, ma'am.

32
00:03:30,179 --> 00:03:31,388
- I'll--
- Sa-rang?

33
00:03:44,276 --> 00:03:45,194
I'm sorry.

34
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:01,210
- Mr. Gu.
- Yes.

35
00:04:02,837 --> 00:04:03,838
Goodness.

36
00:04:07,842 --> 00:04:09,218
- It's delicious.
- Is that so?

37
00:04:54,221 --> 00:04:56,599
EPISODE 13

38
00:04:57,224 --> 00:05:01,687
Seeing Won manage
the 100th-anniversary event made me think,

39
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:04,773
"This kid sure can put up an act."

40
00:05:04,857 --> 00:05:07,109
But it wasn't an act
by the looks of things today.

41
00:05:07,193 --> 00:05:09,737
He actually cares about his employees.

42
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,740
That's why I like him.

43
00:05:13,324 --> 00:05:15,367
He even takes care of people like her.

44
00:05:15,451 --> 00:05:18,245
He's different from
all the pretentious men out there.

45
00:05:19,622 --> 00:05:23,250
You're amazing for liking that about him.

46
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,006
Chairman Han and I
will arrange all the wedding preparations.

47
00:05:29,089 --> 00:05:30,174
Understood?

48
00:05:30,257 --> 00:05:31,634
Yes, Father.

49
00:05:33,594 --> 00:05:34,470
Won.

50
00:05:34,553 --> 00:05:35,596
What about you?

51
00:05:40,768 --> 00:05:41,727
I…

52
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,240
I…

53
00:05:55,699 --> 00:05:57,368
am in love with someone else.

54
00:06:02,957 --> 00:06:04,708
What were you thinking?

55
00:06:06,377 --> 00:06:07,336
I'm sorry.

56
00:06:08,087 --> 00:06:10,673
How did you join King the Land
with those skills?

57
00:06:10,756 --> 00:06:11,840
I'm sorry.

58
00:06:11,924 --> 00:06:14,885
I'll be the main server
and have Sa-rang assist me.

59
00:06:14,969 --> 00:06:17,388
How can I let her go back in
when she dropped a plate?

60
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:20,891
I'll do the serving.
Stay on the second floor.

61
00:06:20,975 --> 00:06:23,852
Wouldn't the second floor
be too difficult for a new member?

62
00:06:23,936 --> 00:06:25,562
That's why you take charge there.

63
00:06:25,646 --> 00:06:27,439
- Ha-na.
- Yes, ma'am.

64
00:06:27,523 --> 00:06:29,817
Since when did King the Land
become so lax?

65
00:06:30,442 --> 00:06:32,361
It wasn't like that when I was there.

66
00:06:33,237 --> 00:06:34,780
It's the room at the very end.

67
00:06:34,863 --> 00:06:36,323
Let's not make any more mistakes.

68
00:06:37,866 --> 00:06:38,826
Yes, ma'am.

69
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,414
Gosh, I thought Won was just a kid.
He's all grown up now.

70
00:06:43,998 --> 00:06:45,666
He even has someone he loves.

71
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,460
- Do you love her a lot?
- Yes.

72
00:06:48,544 --> 00:06:49,378
Of course.

73
00:06:49,461 --> 00:06:51,547
A man should know how to love a woman.

74
00:06:52,214 --> 00:06:55,342
We're not here today
to find out who you're in love with.

75
00:06:55,426 --> 00:06:56,802
We're talking about marriage.

76
00:06:56,885 --> 00:06:59,888
We only need to talk about you and Yu-ri.

77
00:06:59,972 --> 00:07:01,807
I told you from the very beginning.

78
00:07:02,308 --> 00:07:03,392
I'm sorry,

79
00:07:04,226 --> 00:07:07,521
but I've never had feelings for Yu-ri.

80
00:07:08,105 --> 00:07:10,232
- And my feelings won't change.
- Won.

81
00:07:11,025 --> 00:07:12,401
It's okay.

82
00:07:12,484 --> 00:07:15,070
Everyone falls in and out of love.

83
00:07:15,154 --> 00:07:17,698
It's completely normal.
Don't be too concerned.

84
00:07:19,325 --> 00:07:20,326
Won.

85
00:07:20,409 --> 00:07:24,288
Love her all you want,
then break up with her.

86
00:07:24,371 --> 00:07:26,206
We have to get married anyway.

87
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:31,587
She's my daughter,
but she has such a big heart.

88
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:34,381
That is exactly why I had my eye on her.

89
00:07:34,465 --> 00:07:35,507
She has a big heart.

90
00:07:38,302 --> 00:07:39,345
I said…

91
00:07:40,971 --> 00:07:43,932
I'm in love with someone else,
but no one is interested.

92
00:07:46,143 --> 00:07:47,603
I was upset for a second.

93
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:50,939
But I don't think I need to be.

94
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,524
Because

95
00:07:52,608 --> 00:07:55,361
I also have no interest
in any of this marriage talk.

96
00:07:56,403 --> 00:07:58,030
I'll be leaving first.

97
00:07:58,113 --> 00:07:59,990
I hope you have a good time, sir.

98
00:08:00,074 --> 00:08:01,033
You too, Yu-ri.

99
00:08:02,117 --> 00:08:03,661
Let's meet by ourselves next time.

100
00:08:04,703 --> 00:08:08,415
I thought that punk was a softie.

101
00:08:08,499 --> 00:08:09,792
But he has a firm character.

102
00:08:10,417 --> 00:08:11,293
Right, Dad?

103
00:08:11,377 --> 00:08:12,795
He grows on you, doesn't he?

104
00:08:12,878 --> 00:08:14,630
Yes, I like him.

105
00:08:16,465 --> 00:08:17,800
I'll apologize on his behalf.

106
00:08:18,717 --> 00:08:19,885
It's okay.

107
00:08:20,719 --> 00:08:22,137
He's mine anyway.

108
00:08:22,971 --> 00:08:25,140
I'm not going to let anyone else have him,

109
00:08:25,224 --> 00:08:26,517
so don't worry.

110
00:08:52,334 --> 00:08:54,545
<i>The person you have called is unavailable…</i>

111
00:09:10,978 --> 00:09:12,229
We need to talk.

112
00:09:12,813 --> 00:09:14,398
Why didn't you answer my call?

113
00:09:14,481 --> 00:09:16,775
My phone is in my locker.
I'm working right now.

114
00:09:20,654 --> 00:09:22,239
I'm sorry you had to hear that.

115
00:09:24,575 --> 00:09:26,201
Let's talk later.

116
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:27,911
Are you mad?

117
00:09:30,122 --> 00:09:31,123
No.

118
00:09:33,417 --> 00:09:35,043
I was just a little shocked.

119
00:09:42,384 --> 00:09:43,719
It's not going to happen.

120
00:09:44,553 --> 00:09:45,387
Okay?

121
00:09:47,973 --> 00:09:48,974
Okay.

122
00:09:50,017 --> 00:09:52,436
Let's talk later.
I need to serve this quickly.

123
00:10:00,736 --> 00:10:02,362
But why are you working here?

124
00:10:02,446 --> 00:10:03,822
This isn't the hotel.

125
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,451
I wonder that myself.

126
00:10:07,534 --> 00:10:10,078
I'm pretty sure I'm someone
who works at a hotel.

127
00:10:15,918 --> 00:10:18,003
Can you please step aside, sir?

128
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,550
Fine.

129
00:10:24,343 --> 00:10:26,136
Call me as soon as you get off work.

130
00:10:27,054 --> 00:10:27,971
I'll be waiting.

131
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,478
Go ahead.

132
00:11:04,967 --> 00:11:06,885
Your food is ready.

133
00:11:13,225 --> 00:11:14,893
Your food is ready.

134
00:11:21,733 --> 00:11:23,652
I will go ahead and serve your food.

135
00:11:44,756 --> 00:11:46,550
Your food will be served.

136
00:12:19,124 --> 00:12:20,500
Oh my god!

137
00:12:26,006 --> 00:12:27,132
Are you an idiot?

138
00:12:28,008 --> 00:12:29,926
You're so funny.

139
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,803
Look at your face. It's hilarious.

140
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,264
Who are you?

141
00:12:35,432 --> 00:12:37,768
How dare you talk to me like that?
Call me "sir."

142
00:12:38,393 --> 00:12:40,854
Sir, my foot. Apologize.

143
00:12:40,937 --> 00:12:42,773
If you apologize now, I'll forgive you.

144
00:12:42,856 --> 00:12:44,483
That's what people like you do.

145
00:12:44,566 --> 00:12:46,109
I'm not someone who apologizes.

146
00:12:47,277 --> 00:12:48,695
What's wrong with you?

147
00:12:49,488 --> 00:12:51,990
This is your last chance.
Apologize while I count to three.

148
00:12:52,074 --> 00:12:53,450
What? Why should I?

149
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:54,826
One,

150
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,119
- two…
- Three.

151
00:12:56,203 --> 00:12:57,371
What are you going to do?

152
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:10,217
Apologize.

153
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,344
Why should I? Do you know who I am?

154
00:13:12,427 --> 00:13:13,929
I don't need to know who you are.

155
00:13:14,012 --> 00:13:16,181
Spoiled kids like you
need to be taught a lesson.

156
00:13:16,264 --> 00:13:18,141
I told you to apologize!

157
00:13:18,225 --> 00:13:20,060
Stop!

158
00:13:20,143 --> 00:13:21,978
If you don't stop, I won't forgive you!

159
00:13:22,062 --> 00:13:24,523
I get to forgive you.
You just have to apologize.

160
00:13:24,606 --> 00:13:26,858
I'm sorry. Happy now?

161
00:13:26,942 --> 00:13:28,026
In Korean!

162
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,696
I'm sorry. I said I'm sorry.

163
00:13:31,697 --> 00:13:32,906
My gosh.

164
00:13:33,573 --> 00:13:35,992
Just watch. I'll make you pay.

165
00:13:36,076 --> 00:13:37,369
You're going to regret this.

166
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:39,162
Well, too bad.

167
00:13:39,246 --> 00:13:40,872
I don't regret anything.

168
00:13:40,956 --> 00:13:42,124
<i>Ms. Cheon Sa-rang?</i>

169
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,001
Yes, this is Cheon Sa-rang.

170
00:13:45,085 --> 00:13:47,504
<i>Escort Mr. Ji-hu downstairs.
The chairman is asking for him.</i>

171
00:13:48,922 --> 00:13:51,049
- Sorry? Who?
- <i>Mr. Ji-hu.</i>

172
00:13:51,133 --> 00:13:52,426
<i>Ms. Gu's son.</i>

173
00:14:01,101 --> 00:14:02,102
So you're Ji-hu?

174
00:14:09,526 --> 00:14:10,944
The chairman is asking for you.

175
00:14:11,027 --> 00:14:12,863
Shall we go down together, sir?

176
00:14:19,244 --> 00:14:20,370
How delicious.

177
00:14:21,163 --> 00:14:22,831
Our Ji-hu is here.

178
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:25,876
It has been a while.

179
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:27,252
How have you been, sir?

180
00:14:27,335 --> 00:14:30,005
I see. You must be Ji-hu.

181
00:14:30,088 --> 00:14:31,798
He's so mature now.

182
00:14:32,382 --> 00:14:35,135
I know, right?
You're starting to look like your uncle.

183
00:14:35,218 --> 00:14:36,470
You're flattering me.

184
00:14:37,763 --> 00:14:39,931
He has not once ever acted like a baby.

185
00:14:40,015 --> 00:14:41,933
I have a wonderful grandson.

186
00:14:42,017 --> 00:14:44,686
It is an honor
to have been born as your grandson.

187
00:14:45,562 --> 00:14:46,688
Did you hear him?

188
00:14:46,772 --> 00:14:48,690
How could I not adore him?

189
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,364
Good work today.

190
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,366
Accept this with gratitude.

191
00:14:59,201 --> 00:15:00,243
Thank you, ma'am.

192
00:15:01,286 --> 00:15:02,454
Thank you, ma'am.

193
00:15:02,537 --> 00:15:03,580
Thank you, ma'am.

194
00:15:04,664 --> 00:15:05,665
Thank you, ma'am.

195
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:07,918
Thank you, ma'am.

196
00:15:09,503 --> 00:15:10,420
Thank you, ma'am.

197
00:15:12,631 --> 00:15:16,927
You're aware that you don't deserve
to receive this, right?

198
00:15:19,387 --> 00:15:20,430
I'm sorry.

199
00:15:20,514 --> 00:15:22,766
Please be lenient.
It didn't end up being a big problem.

200
00:15:22,849 --> 00:15:24,392
She also went through a lot
working upstairs.

201
00:15:25,477 --> 00:15:28,105
If you're ever chosen
to be a part of the Dream Team again,

202
00:15:28,188 --> 00:15:29,940
relearn the basics before coming back.

203
00:15:32,526 --> 00:15:33,360
Yes, ma'am.

204
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:35,362
Thank you.

205
00:16:13,316 --> 00:16:15,902
My pay for the day
is as much as my monthly paycheck.

206
00:16:40,719 --> 00:16:42,053
So you're in love?

207
00:16:44,014 --> 00:16:45,015
Yes.

208
00:16:46,558 --> 00:16:48,059
I'll keep this short.

209
00:16:48,643 --> 00:16:49,644
End it.

210
00:16:50,312 --> 00:16:51,438
I don't intend to.

211
00:16:52,063 --> 00:16:53,064
I'm

212
00:16:53,899 --> 00:16:55,400
the father

213
00:16:55,984 --> 00:16:57,652
of both you and King Group.

214
00:16:58,278 --> 00:17:01,865
You too are the son
of both me and King Group.

215
00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:04,201
To us,

216
00:17:05,035 --> 00:17:07,162
marriage carries greater value than love.

217
00:17:07,746 --> 00:17:09,164
No matter who you love,

218
00:17:10,498 --> 00:17:12,209
you won't be able to protect her.

219
00:17:13,251 --> 00:17:15,921
And she will end up leaving you too.

220
00:17:16,004 --> 00:17:17,047
No.

221
00:17:18,298 --> 00:17:20,050
That will never happen.

222
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:21,843
Also,

223
00:17:22,719 --> 00:17:24,137
I'm going to protect her

224
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:26,139
at all costs.

225
00:17:28,892 --> 00:17:31,519
Because I love her
from the bottom of my heart.

226
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,523
That's what everyone says at first.

227
00:17:35,607 --> 00:17:38,109
You may not understand
what I mean just yet,

228
00:17:40,237 --> 00:17:41,863
but you'll find out soon enough.

229
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,367
That's all I have to say.

230
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:01,709
<i>The person you have called…</i>

231
00:18:23,106 --> 00:18:24,357
<i>The person you have called…</i>

232
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,858
I've called so many times.

233
00:18:30,488 --> 00:18:31,531
Should I just hop over?

234
00:18:32,031 --> 00:18:33,616
The lights are on.

235
00:18:36,744 --> 00:18:39,414
Sir. Excuse me.

236
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:42,500
Do you live here?

237
00:18:46,671 --> 00:18:48,339
- No.
- You don't live here, right?

238
00:18:48,423 --> 00:18:51,467
We received a report
about a suspicious person loitering.

239
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,511
A suspicious person?

240
00:18:55,555 --> 00:18:56,889
No, I'm the only one here.

241
00:18:56,973 --> 00:18:58,683
Yes, that's why we're here.

242
00:18:58,766 --> 00:19:00,476
Can I see your ID, please?

243
00:19:04,689 --> 00:19:06,899
Someone must've gotten the wrong idea.

244
00:19:06,983 --> 00:19:08,693
I'm not a suspicious person.

245
00:19:08,776 --> 00:19:09,902
Then why are you here?

246
00:19:11,028 --> 00:19:12,947
My girlfriend lives here.

247
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:15,741
I called her numerous times,
but she wouldn't pick up.

248
00:19:15,825 --> 00:19:17,201
So I was worried.

249
00:19:17,285 --> 00:19:18,911
Yeah, he's definitely a stalker.

250
00:19:18,995 --> 00:19:20,872
Let's take him to the station
before sending him home.

251
00:19:21,706 --> 00:19:23,916
We shouldn't conclude that he's a stalker

252
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,626
- without checking.
- Checking what?

253
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:28,129
- Right.
- His girlfriend won't even pick up.

254
00:19:28,713 --> 00:19:32,216
She's deliberately avoiding him,
but he followed her to her house.

255
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,760
He's definitely a stalker.

256
00:19:34,844 --> 00:19:36,304
What do you mean I'm a stalker?

257
00:19:37,221 --> 00:19:40,141
What about me suggests that I'm a stalker?

258
00:19:40,224 --> 00:19:42,059
Everything about you. Without a doubt.

259
00:19:42,143 --> 00:19:43,686
This is your problem.

260
00:19:43,769 --> 00:19:47,023
How do you know if it's romance
or stalking without hearing him out?

261
00:19:48,566 --> 00:19:49,692
Isn't that right, sir?

262
00:19:56,657 --> 00:19:58,784
Yes, I'm not a stalker.

263
00:19:59,744 --> 00:20:01,120
Your eyes speak the truth.

264
00:20:14,467 --> 00:20:15,927
I knew it. It's romance.

265
00:20:17,178 --> 00:20:20,264
He came all the way here
to check on his girlfriend.

266
00:20:21,224 --> 00:20:23,976
He was too sorry
to even ring the doorbell.

267
00:20:25,061 --> 00:20:26,103
Right?

268
00:20:28,189 --> 00:20:29,190
Yes.

269
00:20:29,273 --> 00:20:31,526
Please. Cut the crap, will you?

270
00:20:32,151 --> 00:20:33,945
You have the experience to know better.

271
00:20:34,487 --> 00:20:37,406
Look. The lights are on,
very brightly at that.

272
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:38,866
So why won't she pick up?

273
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,078
She just hates your guts.

274
00:20:42,662 --> 00:20:44,580
Yet you keep calling her nonstop.

275
00:20:45,122 --> 00:20:46,541
And you even came to her house.

276
00:20:46,624 --> 00:20:48,543
Gosh. Who would like that?

277
00:20:48,626 --> 00:20:51,546
The thing is, stalkers don't
even realize that they're stalking.

278
00:20:51,629 --> 00:20:55,424
Then is that why
you never called me when I got upset?

279
00:20:58,386 --> 00:21:00,471
Why are you bringing that up again?

280
00:21:00,555 --> 00:21:02,473
Did you ever come to my house

281
00:21:02,557 --> 00:21:04,559
when I cried after our fight?

282
00:21:04,642 --> 00:21:07,562
I said that I was going to,
but you specifically told me not to.

283
00:21:07,645 --> 00:21:10,523
If I tell you not to,
do you take that at face value?

284
00:21:10,606 --> 00:21:12,400
This is why you're a lost cause!

285
00:21:12,483 --> 00:21:13,776
You keep bringing up the past.

286
00:21:13,859 --> 00:21:16,529
Come to think of it,
you sure can hold a grudge.

287
00:21:16,612 --> 00:21:18,281
Who made me like this?

288
00:21:18,364 --> 00:21:20,241
Me. It's all my fault.

289
00:21:21,701 --> 00:21:23,160
It's me. Everything is my fault.

290
00:21:23,244 --> 00:21:25,246
- At least you know.
- It's all because of me.

291
00:21:25,329 --> 00:21:28,082
So after listening to you two talk,

292
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,626
- How ridiculous.
- I think the two of you

293
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:34,005
should hold hands

294
00:21:35,298 --> 00:21:36,632
and make peace.

295
00:21:38,551 --> 00:21:40,761
I hope you have a deep conversation

296
00:21:41,512 --> 00:21:43,472
and reach an amicable agreement.

297
00:21:44,056 --> 00:21:46,225
Well, then. I'll be leaving.

298
00:21:46,851 --> 00:21:48,894
Have a dazzling conversation.

299
00:21:48,978 --> 00:21:50,104
Goodbye.

300
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:54,567
Give him his ID.

301
00:21:58,863 --> 00:22:01,699
I'll take care of the rest.
You can take a break.

302
00:22:01,782 --> 00:22:03,534
You didn't even eat yet, right?

303
00:22:04,744 --> 00:22:06,245
It's okay. I can eat after this.

304
00:22:06,329 --> 00:22:08,080
I'm not okay with that.

305
00:22:08,873 --> 00:22:10,041
Get some rest.

306
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:20,134
We're selling duty-free items.

307
00:22:20,217 --> 00:22:22,219
Please let me know if you need anything.

308
00:22:22,303 --> 00:22:23,471
Duty-free sales.

309
00:22:23,554 --> 00:22:24,972
We're selling duty-free items.

310
00:22:25,056 --> 00:22:26,515
Do you need anything, ma'am?

311
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:28,142
I would like to buy this.

312
00:22:32,146 --> 00:22:33,856
What? Why are you back already?

313
00:22:34,607 --> 00:22:36,025
We have to dim the lights soon.

314
00:22:36,942 --> 00:22:39,278
How will you increase sales
with that mindset?

315
00:22:40,154 --> 00:22:41,947
Continue until I say you can stop.

316
00:22:46,369 --> 00:22:49,080
I don't think we should disturb
the passengers' time of rest

317
00:22:49,163 --> 00:22:50,289
to increase sales.

318
00:22:54,001 --> 00:22:56,379
This is exactly why
you'll never be promoted.

319
00:22:57,713 --> 00:22:59,840
Pyeong-hwa,
shouldn't you insist on continuing

320
00:22:59,924 --> 00:23:01,467
even if I tell you to stop?

321
00:23:02,885 --> 00:23:05,763
Go out and sell at least one more item.

322
00:23:07,515 --> 00:23:08,641
I'm sorry,

323
00:23:09,225 --> 00:23:10,935
but I can't do that.

324
00:23:11,018 --> 00:23:12,019
Pyeong-hwa.

325
00:23:14,271 --> 00:23:15,648
Who is in charge here?

326
00:23:16,732 --> 00:23:18,943
- You, ma'am.
- And?

327
00:23:19,026 --> 00:23:21,028
You're going against my orders?

328
00:23:21,112 --> 00:23:24,448
For the passengers' rest
and the safety of the employees,

329
00:23:24,532 --> 00:23:26,283
I'm asking you to follow the rules.

330
00:23:28,702 --> 00:23:32,373
I didn't know you cared so much
about the passengers and employees.

331
00:23:45,302 --> 00:23:46,887
Did you come alone, sir?

332
00:23:49,765 --> 00:23:51,767
- Yes.
- I'll escort you to your table.

333
00:24:20,921 --> 00:24:22,298
Your coffee is ready.

334
00:24:23,757 --> 00:24:25,092
I called you.

335
00:24:27,636 --> 00:24:30,347
I fell asleep early last night,
so I couldn't answer.

336
00:24:30,431 --> 00:24:33,601
When I woke up,
it was too late to call you back.

337
00:24:37,688 --> 00:24:40,316
Can we talk after work?

338
00:24:41,775 --> 00:24:42,776
Won!

339
00:24:46,655 --> 00:24:47,865
You were here.

340
00:24:47,948 --> 00:24:49,867
Why didn't you answer my calls?

341
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,702
I don't want you to visit me at work.

342
00:24:51,785 --> 00:24:53,120
I'm here as a guest.

343
00:24:54,038 --> 00:24:56,373
- I want coffee.
- Do you want it to be warm?

344
00:24:56,457 --> 00:24:58,709
- Yes.
- All right. I'll get that ready for you.

345
00:25:05,883 --> 00:25:06,967
What do you want?

346
00:25:07,051 --> 00:25:08,844
I'll just cut to the chase.

347
00:25:09,512 --> 00:25:12,181
There are a lot of men
who want to marry me.

348
00:25:12,264 --> 00:25:13,265
I know.

349
00:25:13,974 --> 00:25:15,392
That's why I won't apologize.

350
00:25:15,476 --> 00:25:17,978
You're so offhand. That's why I like you.

351
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:20,064
Yu-ri.

352
00:25:20,147 --> 00:25:21,273
Yes?

353
00:25:22,733 --> 00:25:23,984
I want you

354
00:25:25,027 --> 00:25:26,779
to experience what love is like.

355
00:25:27,947 --> 00:25:29,907
I've been in a ton of relationships.

356
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,116
True love.

357
00:25:32,868 --> 00:25:35,996
Then you'll be able to understand
what it means

358
00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:38,249
when I say

359
00:25:39,542 --> 00:25:40,834
I'm in love with someone.

360
00:25:43,879 --> 00:25:45,798
That's why I'm going to give it a try

361
00:25:45,881 --> 00:25:46,715
with you.

362
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,175
Find someone else.

363
00:25:49,134 --> 00:25:50,928
Someone who can truly cherish you

364
00:25:51,011 --> 00:25:52,596
and love you.

365
00:25:53,764 --> 00:25:54,807
Meet someone like that.

366
00:25:57,351 --> 00:25:58,644
Think carefully.

367
00:25:59,645 --> 00:26:01,939
If you turn away now,
you won't get another chance.

368
00:26:04,441 --> 00:26:06,235
If I help you,

369
00:26:06,318 --> 00:26:09,238
you know you can have
King Group for yourself.

370
00:26:15,452 --> 00:26:16,912
I'll pay for your coffee.

371
00:26:17,621 --> 00:26:18,747
Enjoy your time here.

372
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:25,462
- One for each of you?
- Yes.

373
00:26:25,546 --> 00:26:26,672
All right. Thank you.

374
00:26:26,755 --> 00:26:28,257
I'll get that ready for you.

375
00:26:43,522 --> 00:26:44,732
I didn't order this.

376
00:26:45,566 --> 00:26:46,984
It's on the house. Enjoy.

377
00:26:48,277 --> 00:26:49,111
Why?

378
00:26:49,194 --> 00:26:52,406
You obviously had a fight
with your girlfriend. Just drink it.

379
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,663
We didn't fight.

380
00:26:59,747 --> 00:27:00,831
You may take this back.

381
00:27:01,457 --> 00:27:03,083
Then were you dumped?

382
00:27:03,876 --> 00:27:06,545
No, we didn't fight, nor did she dump me.

383
00:27:06,629 --> 00:27:07,921
I already told you.

384
00:27:08,005 --> 00:27:09,882
Why is everyone doing this to me?

385
00:27:09,965 --> 00:27:12,676
I'm being serious. We didn't have a fight.

386
00:27:13,218 --> 00:27:15,179
I didn't get dumped either, so take this.

387
00:27:18,932 --> 00:27:19,933
Just accept it.

388
00:27:20,517 --> 00:27:21,685
It's from my heart.

389
00:27:22,436 --> 00:27:23,646
You got this.

390
00:27:23,729 --> 00:27:24,772
Thank you!

391
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,139
Are you okay?

392
00:28:02,351 --> 00:28:04,937
My head says one thing,

393
00:28:06,271 --> 00:28:08,148
and my heart says another.

394
00:28:08,232 --> 00:28:10,776
That means you're not okay.

395
00:28:12,152 --> 00:28:14,113
You don't have to pretend you're okay.

396
00:28:14,822 --> 00:28:16,740
I'm going to give it some thought.

397
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:20,411
All right.

398
00:28:21,245 --> 00:28:23,497
You probably need some time
to think it through.

399
00:28:26,458 --> 00:28:28,168
But you don't have to be too worried.

400
00:28:30,713 --> 00:28:32,214
How am I supposed to do that?

401
00:28:32,297 --> 00:28:34,007
I know you must be worried,

402
00:28:34,925 --> 00:28:36,844
but I hope you can trust me.

403
00:28:37,845 --> 00:28:40,472
I'll take care of it.

404
00:28:40,556 --> 00:28:41,890
It's my problem.

405
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:45,436
It's up to me to decide my future.

406
00:28:55,112 --> 00:28:57,740
Still, I hope you're not thinking
of breaking up with me.

407
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,704
Why would I think of breaking up with you?

408
00:29:04,621 --> 00:29:05,914
Were you thinking of that?

409
00:29:05,998 --> 00:29:07,583
No, why would I?

410
00:29:07,666 --> 00:29:09,460
I would never think that.

411
00:29:09,543 --> 00:29:10,919
I could never let you go.

412
00:29:11,003 --> 00:29:13,547
Then why did you say that?
It's making me upset.

413
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:14,673
I mean…

414
00:29:15,591 --> 00:29:19,094
You said you were feeling down

415
00:29:19,178 --> 00:29:21,513
and needed time to think,

416
00:29:22,765 --> 00:29:25,184
so I thought it was
because of the other day.

417
00:29:28,187 --> 00:29:29,313
The marriage talks?

418
00:29:30,147 --> 00:29:31,607
It did take me by surprise.

419
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:33,859
But it's not like I expected your father

420
00:29:34,651 --> 00:29:36,361
to welcome me with open arms.

421
00:29:37,863 --> 00:29:40,032
You didn't get
my grandma's approval yet either.

422
00:29:41,283 --> 00:29:43,118
What are you talking about?

423
00:29:43,202 --> 00:29:45,996
I'm always number one inside her heart.

424
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,790
You mean <i>candidate</i> number one.

425
00:29:47,873 --> 00:29:48,707
Anyway,

426
00:29:48,791 --> 00:29:50,542
the irreplaceable number one in her heart

427
00:29:50,626 --> 00:29:52,044
is yours truly.

428
00:29:53,587 --> 00:29:57,049
Why are you so proud?
It's not even something that great.

429
00:29:57,132 --> 00:29:59,176
What do you mean it's not something great?

430
00:29:59,259 --> 00:30:02,012
It's the best among the titles I hold.

431
00:30:10,062 --> 00:30:11,271
You're finally smiling.

432
00:30:14,858 --> 00:30:16,985
I really wanted to see
that smile on your face.

433
00:30:18,946 --> 00:30:21,073
You used to hate my smile.

434
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:23,700
So don't worry.

435
00:30:24,284 --> 00:30:25,661
You know how I feel.

436
00:30:25,744 --> 00:30:28,580
That's why I was more worried.

437
00:30:29,957 --> 00:30:32,459
Anyway, don't take
what my father said to heart.

438
00:30:32,543 --> 00:30:36,130
I made it clear
that I'm in love with someone.

439
00:30:38,924 --> 00:30:39,758
I mean,

440
00:30:39,842 --> 00:30:41,510
I was a bit startled, but it's okay.

441
00:30:42,553 --> 00:30:44,555
I knew you wouldn't change over that.

442
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,349
So I tried not to think
negatively about it.

443
00:30:48,267 --> 00:30:49,309
Then

444
00:30:50,269 --> 00:30:53,105
what did you mean when you said
you needed time to think?

445
00:30:57,192 --> 00:30:59,027
Have you heard of the Dream Team?

446
00:31:02,948 --> 00:31:04,700
The Dream Team? What's that?

447
00:31:04,783 --> 00:31:07,202
Apparently, it's every concierge's dream.

448
00:31:08,328 --> 00:31:10,164
I didn't know it at first,

449
00:31:10,247 --> 00:31:12,499
but after experiencing it,
a thought came to mind.

450
00:31:13,792 --> 00:31:17,588
If I work really hard and reach the top,

451
00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:22,885
I just become a maid for a wealthy family.

452
00:31:26,221 --> 00:31:28,682
This isn't the hotel work
that I dreamed of.

453
00:31:30,017 --> 00:31:33,729
I didn't know our employees
got drafted for personal events.

454
00:31:33,812 --> 00:31:37,399
I didn't even know
why you were there that day.

455
00:31:41,653 --> 00:31:43,488
I'll try to make a change,

456
00:31:44,948 --> 00:31:46,241
so just wait a little.

457
00:31:46,992 --> 00:31:49,995
Even if it takes some time,
I'll make sure it happens.

458
00:31:51,163 --> 00:31:52,831
I'll also get rid of the Dream Team.

459
00:31:53,415 --> 00:31:55,375
I'm not sure what's right.

460
00:31:56,752 --> 00:31:59,171
Everyone else seemed to love it
because of the money.

461
00:32:00,214 --> 00:32:01,632
It's just my personal opinion.

462
00:32:03,467 --> 00:32:04,927
My personal disapproval

463
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:07,804
shouldn't prevent others
from earning more money.

464
00:32:11,767 --> 00:32:14,853
Okay. You've been waiting for a long time.

465
00:32:15,354 --> 00:32:18,232
Man, you look more energetic now.

466
00:32:18,315 --> 00:32:20,275
Earlier, he was on the verge of tears.

467
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:21,860
What are you talking about?

468
00:32:22,736 --> 00:32:24,780
What a shame.
I would've loved to see you cry.

469
00:32:24,863 --> 00:32:28,242
- No, he's making things up.
- Then were you on the verge of death?

470
00:32:28,825 --> 00:32:29,660
Jeez.

471
00:32:30,244 --> 00:32:31,578
Just cook for us, please.

472
00:32:31,662 --> 00:32:33,956
All right. Just for you two,

473
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:36,124
I'll start off with the last course.

474
00:33:02,442 --> 00:33:04,945
- It's my heart.
- I was going to say that.

475
00:33:05,028 --> 00:33:06,405
Put it all in your bag.

476
00:33:10,242 --> 00:33:12,077
Dad, what are we eating today?

477
00:33:13,245 --> 00:33:14,997
I'm busy today.

478
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,457
Just order some chicken
to eat with your mom.

479
00:33:17,541 --> 00:33:19,418
What? We were supposed to eat out today.

480
00:33:19,501 --> 00:33:21,003
I can't. I have a meeting.

481
00:33:21,878 --> 00:33:24,214
Today's your wedding anniversary.

482
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:26,383
Don't tell me you forgot again.

483
00:33:27,217 --> 00:33:28,593
You forgot, didn't you?

484
00:33:28,677 --> 00:33:29,636
No, I didn't.

485
00:33:31,638 --> 00:33:35,183
My boss just had to
make all of us gather today.

486
00:33:35,267 --> 00:33:36,435
Today of all days?

487
00:33:36,518 --> 00:33:38,020
Did you tell him what today is?

488
00:33:38,103 --> 00:33:39,396
Of course I did.

489
00:33:39,479 --> 00:33:42,399
But it's not like the company cares
about personal circumstances.

490
00:33:43,275 --> 00:33:45,277
How are you always the same?

491
00:33:45,819 --> 00:33:48,196
People were right
when they said people don't change.

492
00:33:48,905 --> 00:33:50,699
The old sayings are always true.

493
00:33:51,283 --> 00:33:53,702
Well, we can celebrate over the weekend.

494
00:33:55,787 --> 00:33:57,998
By the way,
you should go grocery shopping later.

495
00:33:58,081 --> 00:34:00,000
My dad complained about the side dishes.

496
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:01,918
Why don't you cook for him?

497
00:34:02,002 --> 00:34:03,920
You're his son, you know?

498
00:34:29,571 --> 00:34:30,489
Oh no!

499
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,669
Nice!

500
00:34:46,129 --> 00:34:47,214
Good shot!

501
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,135
- Help me.
- Look.

502
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:54,763
You're too tense right now.
It will ruin your swing.

503
00:34:54,846 --> 00:34:58,100
Here. Open up wide to the right,
then swing gently.

504
00:35:04,815 --> 00:35:06,066
Good. Nice shot!

505
00:35:06,149 --> 00:35:07,651
- Was it okay?
- It was great.

506
00:35:10,904 --> 00:35:11,822
<i>Ready.</i>

507
00:35:16,743 --> 00:35:17,744
Hey!

508
00:35:20,497 --> 00:35:22,332
<i>Nice shot!</i>

509
00:35:24,751 --> 00:35:26,628
What? "Nice shot"?

510
00:35:26,711 --> 00:35:28,046
"It was great"?

511
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:29,589
Let me explain. Honey, wait.

512
00:35:29,673 --> 00:35:31,258
How great, you jerk!

513
00:35:31,842 --> 00:35:32,968
- Honey.
- You're dead.

514
00:35:33,051 --> 00:35:35,262
When will you get a grip?

515
00:35:35,345 --> 00:35:36,263
Honey!

516
00:35:50,694 --> 00:35:52,946
Ow, my legs. My back hurts.

517
00:35:53,864 --> 00:35:55,323
Who said you could get up?

518
00:35:56,283 --> 00:35:57,993
A part of the scallion flew here.

519
00:35:58,952 --> 00:36:00,620
But how did you know I was here?

520
00:36:05,375 --> 00:36:06,501
Hang on.

521
00:36:07,127 --> 00:36:07,961
I'll do it.

522
00:36:08,044 --> 00:36:09,880
Here. Give it to me.

523
00:36:10,755 --> 00:36:13,383
What are you doing?
You should help with this stuff.

524
00:36:15,302 --> 00:36:16,928
You said you had a meeting.

525
00:36:18,054 --> 00:36:19,055
Should I call your manager?

526
00:36:19,681 --> 00:36:20,891
Well, there <i>was</i> a meeting…

527
00:36:20,974 --> 00:36:23,185
Fine. I'll call him.

528
00:36:26,521 --> 00:36:27,814
I quit my job.

529
00:36:32,235 --> 00:36:33,111
I mean,

530
00:36:33,195 --> 00:36:36,156
they gave me the works
because I messed up a contract.

531
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:39,451
Seriously. Everyone makes mistakes!

532
00:36:39,534 --> 00:36:41,912
Have you lost your mind?
When did you quit?

533
00:36:43,538 --> 00:36:44,498
Not too long ago.

534
00:36:44,581 --> 00:36:45,957
Exactly when?

535
00:36:46,041 --> 00:36:47,292
In the spring?

536
00:36:47,792 --> 00:36:48,627
Last year.

537
00:36:49,294 --> 00:36:50,295
Almost a year ago?

538
00:36:51,046 --> 00:36:52,255
My goodness.

539
00:36:52,339 --> 00:36:54,799
Then you've been
pretending to go to work every day?

540
00:36:57,928 --> 00:36:59,846
Where did you get the money to golf?

541
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:02,641
Come on. My severance pay.

542
00:37:03,517 --> 00:37:05,310
They give you quite a lot.

543
00:37:05,393 --> 00:37:07,854
I don't know
what I would've done without it.

544
00:37:09,397 --> 00:37:12,400
Seo Chung-jae, you scumbag.

545
00:37:12,484 --> 00:37:14,486
I'm going to kill you tonight.

546
00:37:17,364 --> 00:37:20,367
HEAD MANAGER GU WON

547
00:37:48,144 --> 00:37:49,688
Ta-da.

548
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,526
You're here.

549
00:37:55,986 --> 00:37:58,989
This is how I've been working
with my employees.

550
00:37:59,072 --> 00:38:00,323
- Here.
- There's more?

551
00:38:04,327 --> 00:38:08,832
Strength, weakness, opportunity, threat.

552
00:38:08,915 --> 00:38:10,458
What do consumers
perceive to be our strength?

553
00:38:10,542 --> 00:38:11,710
Our strength?

554
00:38:23,638 --> 00:38:26,141
I'm calling in regard to Dubai Hotel.

555
00:38:27,183 --> 00:38:28,018
Yes.

556
00:39:32,666 --> 00:39:33,708
Mr. Gu.

557
00:39:35,335 --> 00:39:37,921
I heard Ms. Gu had all of the executives

558
00:39:38,004 --> 00:39:40,256
stay up all night for a week
writing the proposal.

559
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,384
Will we be able to beat them?

560
00:39:42,967 --> 00:39:44,761
It's going to be a head-to-head battle.

561
00:39:46,096 --> 00:39:48,098
We're not here to fight.

562
00:39:48,181 --> 00:39:49,891
We're here to work.

563
00:39:49,974 --> 00:39:52,602
I know that,
but they keep picking a fight.

564
00:39:56,439 --> 00:39:57,399
You trust me, right?

565
00:39:57,482 --> 00:39:58,608
Of course I do.

566
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:00,360
You got this!

567
00:40:05,865 --> 00:40:08,076
Okay. Go ahead.

568
00:40:09,077 --> 00:40:09,953
Present it to him.

569
00:40:10,537 --> 00:40:11,538
Yes, ma'am.

570
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:16,376
Goodness.

571
00:40:17,127 --> 00:40:18,378
SURVIVAL MANAGEMENT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

572
00:40:18,461 --> 00:40:20,046
You've come quite prepared.

573
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:21,297
The key point is simple.

574
00:40:21,381 --> 00:40:25,176
It's about the overall reduction
of our fixed and variable expenses.

575
00:40:25,802 --> 00:40:27,804
The first expense to consider is payroll.

576
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,392
We should hire fewer full-time employees
and create more contract positions.

577
00:40:33,017 --> 00:40:35,937
Will we have enough employees
for peak seasons and banquets?

578
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:39,190
We can employ trainees
or part-time employees.

579
00:40:41,234 --> 00:40:43,194
Wouldn't that affect our service quality?

580
00:40:43,278 --> 00:40:46,448
No. They will be trained before banquets,

581
00:40:46,531 --> 00:40:49,242
and they'll only have to serve meals.
It won't be a problem.

582
00:40:50,201 --> 00:40:54,914
Additionally, if we implement
a smart check-in and check-out system,

583
00:40:54,998 --> 00:40:57,417
we will be able
to gradually reduce manpower.

584
00:40:58,126 --> 00:41:00,044
"Discontinuing the shuttle bus,

585
00:41:00,128 --> 00:41:02,046
slimming down the employee cafeteria menu,

586
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:05,425
and eliminating water and snacks
in the staff lounge."

587
00:41:08,094 --> 00:41:09,596
You really tackled everything.

588
00:41:10,388 --> 00:41:11,765
It's survival management.

589
00:41:12,891 --> 00:41:14,350
What's the expected effect?

590
00:41:14,434 --> 00:41:15,810
It's expected to save

591
00:41:15,894 --> 00:41:18,605
about a billion won a month
and over ten billion won a year.

592
00:41:19,105 --> 00:41:20,148
Ten billion won?

593
00:41:22,025 --> 00:41:23,151
Head Manager Gu,

594
00:41:23,234 --> 00:41:26,362
do you know how many standard rooms
need to be sold to make ten billion won?

595
00:41:26,446 --> 00:41:29,866
In terms of standard rooms, about 34,000.

596
00:41:30,825 --> 00:41:31,659
How precise.

597
00:41:32,452 --> 00:41:35,288
Do you still think
cutting costs is ineffective?

598
00:41:35,371 --> 00:41:36,414
Yes.

599
00:41:37,665 --> 00:41:41,252
Our Mr. Gu here sounds so confident.

600
00:41:41,795 --> 00:41:43,588
Whatever you say from this point on

601
00:41:43,671 --> 00:41:45,840
needs to be worth
more than ten billion won.

602
00:41:48,301 --> 00:41:49,427
A hotel

603
00:41:50,261 --> 00:41:52,430
should not just focus on selling rooms.

604
00:41:53,097 --> 00:41:55,183
It should provide a memorable experience.

605
00:41:55,266 --> 00:41:57,769
In order for the employees
to serve from the heart,

606
00:41:57,852 --> 00:42:00,772
- the company must support--
- Enough with the theories.

607
00:42:00,855 --> 00:42:03,525
Talk about the money, okay? The money.

608
00:42:06,152 --> 00:42:07,195
Then,

609
00:42:08,196 --> 00:42:10,031
should I start with

610
00:42:11,699 --> 00:42:13,368
a hundred billion won?

611
00:42:13,451 --> 00:42:14,619
What?

612
00:42:26,965 --> 00:42:31,302
I offered management consulting
to 170 local hotels around the world,

613
00:42:31,386 --> 00:42:32,762
and 30 hotels

614
00:42:32,846 --> 00:42:34,931
signed management agreements with us.

615
00:42:35,765 --> 00:42:37,642
As you may know, a management agreement

616
00:42:37,725 --> 00:42:40,144
grants us a portion of the hotels' profits

617
00:42:40,228 --> 00:42:43,398
in return for our name and services.

618
00:42:43,481 --> 00:42:44,941
The expected annual return

619
00:42:46,568 --> 00:42:49,028
is more than 35 billion won.

620
00:42:51,489 --> 00:42:53,408
When did you get all of this done?

621
00:42:53,491 --> 00:42:56,160
A six-star hotel
under construction in Dubai has offered

622
00:42:56,244 --> 00:42:57,871
to make King Hotel a hotel chain.

623
00:42:57,954 --> 00:42:59,664
We've already signed a chain contract

624
00:42:59,747 --> 00:43:01,499
with Comfortabele Resort of Belgium,

625
00:43:01,583 --> 00:43:03,126
a newcomer to the industry.

626
00:43:03,835 --> 00:43:06,796
King Hotel will no longer remain
a domestic brand.

627
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:11,843
You will be able to see
King Hotel all over the world.

628
00:43:13,803 --> 00:43:15,263
This was only possible

629
00:43:15,346 --> 00:43:18,850
because King Hotel
won the World of Best Talent Award.

630
00:43:18,933 --> 00:43:21,519
I didn't accomplish anything on my own.

631
00:43:21,603 --> 00:43:23,980
It's thanks to the people
who built this hotel over 100 years,

632
00:43:24,772 --> 00:43:27,317
which includes everyone here.

633
00:43:28,568 --> 00:43:30,153
The company makes the employees.

634
00:43:30,778 --> 00:43:32,906
And the employees make the company.

635
00:43:33,406 --> 00:43:35,116
You mentioned casual employment.

636
00:43:35,783 --> 00:43:38,870
That would make it easy to
hire people briefly and get rid of them.

637
00:43:38,953 --> 00:43:42,457
But it would also make it easy for them
to abandon the company.

638
00:43:43,374 --> 00:43:46,794
So those ready to abandon each other
will be working together.

639
00:43:47,754 --> 00:43:49,005
Let's not do that anymore.

640
00:43:50,882 --> 00:43:52,300
In my opinion, this project

641
00:43:52,383 --> 00:43:54,510
will bring in
more than a hundred billion won.

642
00:43:55,053 --> 00:43:56,304
What do you think, Ms. Gu?

643
00:43:58,389 --> 00:43:59,724
Cost reduction

644
00:43:59,807 --> 00:44:02,435
is something that any company
must achieve,

645
00:44:03,019 --> 00:44:05,605
no matter how great
the increase in sales is.

646
00:44:05,688 --> 00:44:07,815
Yes, I agree with you on that.

647
00:44:08,608 --> 00:44:09,692
But the thing is…

648
00:44:11,945 --> 00:44:15,448
whenever I traveled overseas,
I always thought the same thing.

649
00:44:16,074 --> 00:44:18,117
"Why does this country
not have a King Hotel?"

650
00:44:18,743 --> 00:44:21,371
"Why can't we become
a worldwide hotel chain?"

651
00:44:22,246 --> 00:44:24,332
It's not like we don't have
enough resources.

652
00:44:24,415 --> 00:44:25,333
Right?

653
00:44:25,416 --> 00:44:26,626
Mr. Gu,

654
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:29,128
what is the reason?

655
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,550
I think it's because King Hotel
doesn't have an established brand image.

656
00:44:35,134 --> 00:44:39,180
It's just one of the numerous
luxurious hotels out there.

657
00:44:39,263 --> 00:44:41,808
However, an image is not made easily.

658
00:44:41,891 --> 00:44:45,770
It needs to be built up over time.

659
00:44:46,396 --> 00:44:47,480
Fortunately,

660
00:44:47,563 --> 00:44:49,941
our hotel has a 100-year history.

661
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:52,402
With the 100th-anniversary event,

662
00:44:53,111 --> 00:44:56,197
it can be said that King Hotel

663
00:44:57,073 --> 00:44:58,449
has gained its own image.

664
00:45:03,579 --> 00:45:04,664
Mr. Gu.

665
00:45:05,415 --> 00:45:06,791
Starting next month,

666
00:45:07,583 --> 00:45:08,960
you're the president of the hotel.

667
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:14,424
Be at the forefront and make
King Hotel the best hotel in the world.

668
00:45:15,299 --> 00:45:17,510
- Father…
- You should do whatever you can to help.

669
00:45:18,845 --> 00:45:19,804
You can do that, right?

670
00:45:20,388 --> 00:45:22,849
Yes, I will.

671
00:45:30,898 --> 00:45:32,608
You accomplished

672
00:45:34,277 --> 00:45:35,695
what I desperately wanted to do.

673
00:45:57,175 --> 00:45:58,926
Why don't you give up on the hotel, ma'am?

674
00:45:59,427 --> 00:46:02,221
I think it'd be best for you
to focus on Air and Distribution.

675
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:05,433
That might be more effective.

676
00:46:06,017 --> 00:46:09,020
The hotel is smaller in scale
compared to Air and Distribution.

677
00:46:09,103 --> 00:46:10,354
But the thing is,

678
00:46:11,856 --> 00:46:13,399
I don't want to give him anything.

679
00:46:14,776 --> 00:46:17,945
Is there a reason
why you can't give up on the hotel?

680
00:46:18,029 --> 00:46:19,739
Because Won likes the hotel.

681
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,075
All the more reason not to give it up.

682
00:46:25,828 --> 00:46:26,996
SEOUL FAMILY COURT

683
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:28,247
Are those divorce papers?

684
00:46:30,666 --> 00:46:32,668
Since when did you ask me such questions?

685
00:46:32,752 --> 00:46:34,921
Even if you get a divorce,
it can't be now.

686
00:46:35,004 --> 00:46:36,130
It's not the right time.

687
00:46:36,214 --> 00:46:37,590
You should wait it out.

688
00:46:39,842 --> 00:46:40,802
Mr. Choi.

689
00:46:41,385 --> 00:46:42,887
You've known me for a while, right?

690
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:45,431
I've worked for you since you were young.

691
00:46:46,724 --> 00:46:48,726
Have you ever seen me give up on anything?

692
00:46:50,686 --> 00:46:51,521
No.

693
00:46:51,604 --> 00:46:54,065
So why would you say that
when you know that very well?

694
00:46:54,982 --> 00:46:56,484
"Give up on the hotel"?

695
00:46:58,778 --> 00:47:01,531
There's only one way
for Won to possess the hotel.

696
00:47:02,949 --> 00:47:04,659
It's when I abandon it.

697
00:47:06,327 --> 00:47:07,703
Only then will it be possible.

698
00:47:11,374 --> 00:47:12,208
I understand.

699
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:13,960
You may leave.

700
00:47:34,021 --> 00:47:35,064
Thank you.

701
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,401
This is unbelievable.

702
00:47:38,484 --> 00:47:40,778
Did you hear the news
that's hot off the press?

703
00:47:40,862 --> 00:47:41,946
What is it?

704
00:47:42,029 --> 00:47:45,241
Mr. Gu outrivaled Ms. Gu
and is finally going to be the president.

705
00:47:45,825 --> 00:47:46,868
Really?

706
00:47:47,368 --> 00:47:50,246
If I knew this would happen,
I would've gotten on his good side.

707
00:47:54,166 --> 00:47:56,210
Sa-rang, can we have a word?

708
00:47:56,294 --> 00:47:57,211
Yes, ma'am.

709
00:48:04,343 --> 00:48:06,345
You will be on special duty.

710
00:48:06,429 --> 00:48:08,973
You won't be working
in King the Land for the time being.

711
00:48:09,807 --> 00:48:11,309
- Just me?
- Yes.

712
00:48:11,893 --> 00:48:13,477
Special orders from the chairman.

713
00:48:14,604 --> 00:48:15,813
The chairman?

714
00:48:16,314 --> 00:48:17,773
I'm sorry.

715
00:48:17,857 --> 00:48:20,776
Ji-hu said it had to be you.

716
00:48:21,402 --> 00:48:23,362
Please look after him while he's in Korea.

717
00:48:23,946 --> 00:48:26,032
That kid's a shrewd judge of character.

718
00:48:26,699 --> 00:48:29,619
He knew you were our hotel's
best employee right away.

719
00:48:33,873 --> 00:48:35,333
I'm sorry,

720
00:48:35,833 --> 00:48:40,254
but may I ask if I'm doing this
as a King Hotel employee?

721
00:48:43,758 --> 00:48:45,676
Let's call it a personal request.

722
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:49,388
It's the first time
that he's ever asked me for anything.

723
00:48:49,972 --> 00:48:54,060
I just wanted to grant my grandson's wish.

724
00:48:54,143 --> 00:48:55,478
Did I go too far?

725
00:48:56,979 --> 00:48:59,065
No, sir. I understand.

726
00:49:01,317 --> 00:49:03,361
- But…
- What is it?

727
00:49:04,862 --> 00:49:07,073
Can I treat him
like he's my younger brother?

728
00:49:08,032 --> 00:49:09,367
I couldn't ask for more.

729
00:49:11,243 --> 00:49:14,288
Ji-hu is an only child,
so he grew up lonely.

730
00:49:16,332 --> 00:49:17,375
Yes, sir.

731
00:49:30,972 --> 00:49:32,390
Mr. Ji-hu?

732
00:49:34,225 --> 00:49:35,309
Mr. Ji-hu?

733
00:49:36,727 --> 00:49:38,896
Where could he be?

734
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:41,190
Ji-hu!

735
00:49:42,191 --> 00:49:43,859
Where in the world are you?

736
00:49:44,443 --> 00:49:45,695
Are you over here?

737
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,188
What? You scared me!

738
00:50:21,272 --> 00:50:22,648
How does that make you feel?

739
00:50:22,732 --> 00:50:25,317
How dare you?
Do you think you'll get away with this?

740
00:50:25,985 --> 00:50:26,944
Watch out.

741
00:50:27,028 --> 00:50:28,487
You'll get a taste of hell.

742
00:50:28,571 --> 00:50:29,780
What?

743
00:50:29,864 --> 00:50:32,366
Then did you call me
to get revenge and torment me?

744
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:33,784
Why? Are you scared?

745
00:50:34,410 --> 00:50:35,911
No, not at all.

746
00:50:36,495 --> 00:50:38,664
If you're a man, you should play fair.

747
00:50:38,748 --> 00:50:40,166
But you were hiding in a mask.

748
00:50:41,751 --> 00:50:44,628
Maybe it's because you're a kid.
Your behavior is ungentlemanly.

749
00:50:44,712 --> 00:50:45,671
Don't call me a kid.

750
00:50:45,755 --> 00:50:47,089
I'm not a kid.

751
00:50:47,173 --> 00:50:48,966
Is that so?

752
00:50:49,967 --> 00:50:51,052
You're right.

753
00:50:51,135 --> 00:50:53,471
Seeing how childish you are,
you're not a kid.

754
00:50:54,513 --> 00:50:56,432
A baby. You're a baby.

755
00:50:56,515 --> 00:50:58,100
You're a baby, right?

756
00:50:58,184 --> 00:50:59,852
Don't call me a baby!

757
00:50:59,935 --> 00:51:01,812
- Bring it on.
- "Bring it on."

758
00:51:25,044 --> 00:51:26,087
It's my turn.

759
00:51:33,135 --> 00:51:34,929
I won, so now you have to speak politely.

760
00:51:35,012 --> 00:51:36,180
Let's play one more time.

761
00:51:37,056 --> 00:51:38,432
It's ten to zero.

762
00:51:38,516 --> 00:51:39,934
You said it was the last round.

763
00:51:40,017 --> 00:51:41,644
Just one more round.

764
00:51:41,727 --> 00:51:43,854
- Do you want to play that much?
- Yes.

765
00:51:46,398 --> 00:51:48,567
Then how should you ask me?

766
00:51:50,778 --> 00:51:51,612
Sa-rang,

767
00:51:52,863 --> 00:51:54,824
can we play one more round,

768
00:51:55,616 --> 00:51:56,784
please?

769
00:51:56,867 --> 00:51:58,035
Good.

770
00:51:58,119 --> 00:51:59,203
All right.

771
00:51:59,286 --> 00:52:01,747
- This is really the last time.
- Awesome!

772
00:52:12,258 --> 00:52:13,092
Not up…

773
00:52:17,179 --> 00:52:18,764
Try again. Ready?

774
00:52:18,848 --> 00:52:19,723
One,

775
00:52:19,807 --> 00:52:20,891
two,

776
00:52:20,975 --> 00:52:22,268
three.

777
00:52:25,604 --> 00:52:26,689
Good job.

778
00:52:35,239 --> 00:52:36,323
It's tasty, isn't it?

779
00:52:36,407 --> 00:52:37,575
Yeah.

780
00:52:37,658 --> 00:52:40,119
By the way, I have a question.

781
00:52:41,287 --> 00:52:42,830
Why do you do that?

782
00:52:42,913 --> 00:52:45,040
Why do you act nice
in front of the adults,

783
00:52:45,124 --> 00:52:46,834
then bully the weak?

784
00:52:46,917 --> 00:52:48,210
Is that fun?

785
00:52:48,961 --> 00:52:50,004
I do what I want.

786
00:52:53,632 --> 00:52:54,925
You don't have any friends, do you?

787
00:52:55,009 --> 00:52:57,678
Only nobodies make friends.

788
00:52:58,304 --> 00:52:59,597
I don't need them.

789
00:53:00,848 --> 00:53:02,516
I knew it.

790
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,935
Who would want to hang out
with a grump like you?

791
00:53:05,811 --> 00:53:07,021
That's not true.

792
00:53:07,104 --> 00:53:09,356
I'm just not making any
because I don't need them.

793
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,233
That's what you want to think.

794
00:53:11,317 --> 00:53:12,526
No, it's not.

795
00:53:18,032 --> 00:53:20,242
You need to be nice
if you want to make friends.

796
00:53:20,326 --> 00:53:23,412
If you pick on people and bully them,
you won't make any friends.

797
00:53:23,495 --> 00:53:26,123
So don't be like that from now on. Got it?

798
00:53:28,542 --> 00:53:29,710
Let's go inside now.

799
00:53:34,924 --> 00:53:37,009
Can we play a little more?

800
00:53:40,221 --> 00:53:41,597
Are you asking me a favor?

801
00:53:50,022 --> 00:53:52,107
All right. Just because it's a favor.

802
00:53:52,191 --> 00:53:53,275
Yes!

803
00:53:53,859 --> 00:53:55,444
Okay. Let's play.

804
00:53:56,987 --> 00:53:58,155
Grandpa!

805
00:53:58,239 --> 00:53:59,198
Why hello.

806
00:54:00,741 --> 00:54:02,243
You must've had a lot of fun.

807
00:54:02,326 --> 00:54:04,745
Yes. We're going to play again
tomorrow too.

808
00:54:05,955 --> 00:54:07,456
Go upstairs and wash your hands.

809
00:54:07,539 --> 00:54:08,666
I'll bring some snacks.

810
00:54:08,749 --> 00:54:09,708
Okay, Sa-rang.

811
00:54:12,169 --> 00:54:14,505
I've never seen him look so happy.

812
00:54:14,588 --> 00:54:16,382
It's like you're his actual sister.

813
00:54:17,508 --> 00:54:18,342
Thank you.

814
00:54:18,425 --> 00:54:20,761
Don't mention it. I had a lot of fun too.

815
00:54:33,732 --> 00:54:34,733
You were home.

816
00:54:34,817 --> 00:54:35,859
Why are you here?

817
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:39,989
I'll be working here for the time being.

818
00:54:40,072 --> 00:54:42,449
The chairman asked me to look after Ji-hu.

819
00:54:43,951 --> 00:54:45,661
He asked you to look after Ji-hu?

820
00:54:48,163 --> 00:54:49,957
You don't have to. I'll talk to him.

821
00:54:51,166 --> 00:54:52,710
He asked me respectfully.

822
00:54:52,793 --> 00:54:54,837
He didn't order me to do it
as the chairman.

823
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:57,631
He asked me out of love for his grandson,

824
00:54:57,715 --> 00:54:58,841
so I said yes.

825
00:54:58,924 --> 00:55:01,760
But still,
how could he ask you to do that?

826
00:55:01,844 --> 00:55:03,095
I already agreed to it.

827
00:55:03,178 --> 00:55:06,098
I'm having fun in my own way,
so don't worry.

828
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:09,643
All right, fine.

829
00:55:10,227 --> 00:55:13,272
But you have to tell me
if anyone gives you a hard time.

830
00:55:14,356 --> 00:55:16,191
Okay. I will.

831
00:55:20,904 --> 00:55:24,491
So this is Head Manager Gu Won's room.

832
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,036
- Can I look around?
- Of course.

833
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:30,122
But how long are you going to
call me by my title?

834
00:55:30,205 --> 00:55:31,290
We're not even at work.

835
00:55:34,543 --> 00:55:36,628
Fine, Mr. Won.

836
00:55:36,712 --> 00:55:38,297
What's "Mr. Won"?

837
00:55:39,089 --> 00:55:39,923
I don't know.

838
00:55:43,635 --> 00:55:44,803
It's the king carp.

839
00:55:48,098 --> 00:55:49,266
This…

840
00:55:51,393 --> 00:55:52,603
It was so hard

841
00:55:52,686 --> 00:55:55,147
trying to put these pieces back together.

842
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:58,317
Why did you go
to the trouble of doing that?

843
00:55:59,109 --> 00:56:00,319
It's a memory

844
00:56:00,402 --> 00:56:02,029
from our first date.

845
00:56:07,034 --> 00:56:07,951
What's this?

846
00:56:11,955 --> 00:56:12,915
Wait.

847
00:56:12,998 --> 00:56:15,042
Is this when you started liking me?

848
00:56:15,125 --> 00:56:16,460
Well, not exactly.

849
00:56:17,127 --> 00:56:18,837
- Give it back. I'm embarrassed.
- Gosh.

850
00:56:18,921 --> 00:56:20,005
- No.
- Come on.

851
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:22,716
- Come on. I'm embarrassed.
- No.

852
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:23,926
- Give it to me.
- No.

853
00:56:24,009 --> 00:56:25,219
- I'm embarrassed.
- No.

854
00:56:25,302 --> 00:56:26,887
- Give it back already.
- No.

855
00:56:36,063 --> 00:56:37,731
What are you doing in my house?

856
00:56:41,276 --> 00:56:42,403
So this is

857
00:56:43,654 --> 00:56:46,240
the bed that you sleep in, Mr. Won.

858
00:56:56,125 --> 00:56:57,251
Sa-rang.

859
00:56:59,253 --> 00:57:00,462
Are you in here?

860
00:57:05,509 --> 00:57:06,760
Sa-rang, are you in here?

861
00:57:11,348 --> 00:57:12,266
Ta-da!

862
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:14,059
What are you doing here?

863
00:57:14,893 --> 00:57:16,645
Hide-and-seek!

864
00:57:17,229 --> 00:57:18,939
You have to hide this time, okay?

865
00:57:19,022 --> 00:57:20,065
-Ten,
-Hold on.

866
00:57:20,149 --> 00:57:21,525
-nine,
-Count slowly.

867
00:57:21,608 --> 00:57:23,485
eight, seven,

868
00:57:24,153 --> 00:57:25,112
six,

869
00:57:25,988 --> 00:57:26,905
five,

870
00:57:27,448 --> 00:57:29,825
four, three…

871
00:57:32,035 --> 00:57:34,329
two, one!

872
00:57:34,997 --> 00:57:36,081
Here I come!

873
00:57:37,916 --> 00:57:40,753
Ji-hu, that punk. He didn't even knock.

874
00:57:43,964 --> 00:57:45,174
It was exhausting, right?

875
00:57:46,049 --> 00:57:48,051
I heard parenting
is the world's hardest job.

876
00:57:48,135 --> 00:57:49,219
I think that's true.

877
00:57:52,181 --> 00:57:53,390
By any chance,

878
00:57:54,308 --> 00:57:55,976
have you ever spent time with Ji-hu?

879
00:57:57,144 --> 00:58:00,063
When Ji-hu was younger,
I was studying abroad.

880
00:58:00,147 --> 00:58:03,609
And when I was in Korea, he was abroad,
so our paths rarely crossed.

881
00:58:04,401 --> 00:58:05,319
Why do you ask?

882
00:58:05,402 --> 00:58:08,071
Just because he's young,
but he already looks so lonely.

883
00:58:08,155 --> 00:58:09,615
- Ji-hu does?
- Yes.

884
00:58:11,158 --> 00:58:13,786
It feels like he has no one around him.

885
00:58:15,746 --> 00:58:19,416
He's so well-behaved and mature,
so I had no idea.

886
00:58:20,751 --> 00:58:22,711
Kids being mature is not a good sign.

887
00:58:22,795 --> 00:58:24,755
Adults should be the mature ones.

888
00:58:24,838 --> 00:58:26,715
Even being mature as an adult is hard.

889
00:58:56,161 --> 00:58:56,995
Ji-hu,

890
00:58:57,079 --> 00:58:58,664
you should sleep in your bed.

891
00:59:00,332 --> 00:59:01,166
Ji-hu.

892
00:59:04,795 --> 00:59:06,338
You're home, Uncle Won.

893
00:59:06,421 --> 00:59:08,882
Yes. Let's go sleep upstairs.

894
00:59:10,217 --> 00:59:11,885
Mom isn't home yet.

895
00:59:14,596 --> 00:59:16,181
I think your mom will be late.

896
00:59:16,265 --> 00:59:18,809
Why don't you go to bed early
and see her tomorrow?

897
00:59:18,892 --> 00:59:20,978
I missed her yesterday
and the day before that.

898
00:59:21,854 --> 00:59:23,647
I really want to see her today.

899
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:25,315
Can I just wait for her?

900
00:59:32,364 --> 00:59:33,866
Sure, go ahead.

901
00:59:34,741 --> 00:59:36,285
Okay. Thank you.

902
00:59:40,414 --> 00:59:41,456
Mom!

903
00:59:43,208 --> 00:59:44,501
Why are you still here?

904
00:59:45,544 --> 00:59:46,879
Did you not go to the US?

905
00:59:47,713 --> 00:59:49,965
Can't I stay here for a little longer?

906
00:59:50,048 --> 00:59:51,925
I told you that now's not a good time.

907
00:59:52,009 --> 00:59:53,594
Why won't you listen?

908
00:59:54,845 --> 00:59:56,263
I'm sorry.

909
00:59:57,598 --> 00:59:58,682
Go to your room.

910
00:59:58,765 --> 00:59:59,766
Okay.

911
01:00:14,823 --> 01:00:17,701
You sure prepared a lot behind the scenes.

912
01:00:19,453 --> 01:00:20,579
I told you.

913
01:00:21,496 --> 01:00:23,665
You don't deserve
to be the owner of the group.

914
01:00:24,833 --> 01:00:26,335
You talk like you've already won.

915
01:00:28,045 --> 01:00:30,172
Do you really think it's over?

916
01:00:30,255 --> 01:00:31,089
You're so naive.

917
01:00:31,173 --> 01:00:32,633
Is the company all that matters?

918
01:00:33,634 --> 01:00:35,928
Does Ji-hu not exist to you?

919
01:00:36,511 --> 01:00:38,055
Do you know how long he waited for you?

920
01:00:38,138 --> 01:00:39,181
What?

921
01:00:40,223 --> 01:00:41,642
Does he remind you of yourself?

922
01:00:43,101 --> 01:00:45,020
You always cried, looking for your mom.

923
01:00:47,689 --> 01:00:48,649
But you know what?

924
01:00:52,361 --> 01:00:53,904
Ji-hu isn't you.

925
01:00:54,947 --> 01:00:56,740
And I'm not like your mom.

926
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:00,410
Don't give me advice
from your lowly perspective.

927
01:01:01,703 --> 01:01:02,829
How arrogant of you.

928
01:01:54,965 --> 01:01:57,384
It's my first time in your room.

929
01:02:12,232 --> 01:02:13,942
It's your first time back in a while.

930
01:02:14,443 --> 01:02:15,944
Is there anything you want to do?

931
01:02:17,154 --> 01:02:18,280
I'm okay.

932
01:02:28,749 --> 01:02:29,791
Well,

933
01:02:30,751 --> 01:02:32,502
if you happen to think of something,

934
01:02:33,754 --> 01:02:35,589
please let me know.

935
01:02:37,299 --> 01:02:38,633
We can do it together.

936
01:02:59,529 --> 01:03:00,781
- Ta-da!
- It's <i>gimbap</i>!

937
01:03:00,864 --> 01:03:02,449
You made all of this yourself?

938
01:03:02,532 --> 01:03:04,117
Of course I did.

939
01:03:13,335 --> 01:03:14,336
Here.

940
01:03:19,591 --> 01:03:21,802
- Ji-hu. One, two, three.
- Hold this.

941
01:03:23,011 --> 01:03:24,429
- Here.
- You're good at this.

942
01:03:24,513 --> 01:03:25,639
I'm pretty good.

943
01:03:25,722 --> 01:03:27,099
We did it.

944
01:03:39,152 --> 01:03:41,071
I'm going to grow up to be like you.

945
01:03:41,696 --> 01:03:42,656
Why?

946
01:03:42,739 --> 01:03:44,116
You're cool.

947
01:03:44,199 --> 01:03:46,326
You're the coolest person in the world.

948
01:03:48,286 --> 01:03:50,705
Thanks for saying that.

949
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:54,709
However,

950
01:03:55,669 --> 01:03:58,213
there's one thing I did
that you shouldn't do.

951
01:03:58,839 --> 01:04:00,173
What is it?

952
01:04:05,053 --> 01:04:07,013
You have to cry when you want to

953
01:04:07,973 --> 01:04:09,975
and laugh when you want to.

954
01:04:11,601 --> 01:04:14,396
If you're mad, get mad and make a fuss.

955
01:04:15,313 --> 01:04:16,690
But most importantly,

956
01:04:16,773 --> 01:04:19,442
if you miss someone,
tell them that you miss them.

957
01:04:20,110 --> 01:04:21,820
Whether it's your mom or your dad.

958
01:04:25,615 --> 01:04:26,867
Can I do that?

959
01:04:27,409 --> 01:04:28,326
Of course.

960
01:04:29,452 --> 01:04:31,288
Being honest isn't a bad thing.

961
01:04:31,371 --> 01:04:32,664
It means you're brave.

962
01:04:40,505 --> 01:04:41,590
I…

963
01:04:42,924 --> 01:04:45,594
want you to become a brave person.

964
01:04:46,928 --> 01:04:50,473
A brave person is the coolest person.

965
01:04:51,266 --> 01:04:52,684
Even cooler than me.

966
01:04:55,145 --> 01:04:56,146
Then…

967
01:04:57,439 --> 01:04:59,983
can I stay in Korea for a little longer?

968
01:05:00,066 --> 01:05:02,277
- Is that what you want to do?
- Yes.

969
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:04,529
I never got to play with my mom yet.

970
01:05:08,325 --> 01:05:09,284
Okay.

971
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,412
I'll help you do that.

972
01:05:12,495 --> 01:05:13,538
Really?

973
01:05:14,164 --> 01:05:15,332
Thank you.

974
01:05:16,499 --> 01:05:18,585
- Ji-hu.
- Sa-rang!

975
01:05:23,548 --> 01:05:24,716
What is that?

976
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:26,384
Tornado potatoes.
Have you tried it before?

977
01:05:26,468 --> 01:05:28,094
- No.
- You haven't?

978
01:05:28,178 --> 01:05:29,179
- Give it.
- You want it?

979
01:05:29,262 --> 01:05:30,180
You can't have it.

980
01:05:31,473 --> 01:05:32,682
Here you go.

981
01:06:43,878 --> 01:06:46,464
You're not here
to talk about work, are you?

982
01:06:47,632 --> 01:06:48,675
No, I'm not.

983
01:06:50,135 --> 01:06:51,177
Then

984
01:06:51,928 --> 01:06:53,888
may I speak casually?

985
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:57,017
Yes, you may.

986
01:06:59,185 --> 01:07:00,478
I've been waiting.

987
01:07:01,396 --> 01:07:03,481
Waiting for you to come find me.

988
01:07:06,943 --> 01:07:07,986
You're…

989
01:07:10,572 --> 01:07:13,074
the one who sent me
my mother's personnel record, right?

990
01:07:18,663 --> 01:07:20,206
There's something I'd like to ask.

991
01:08:00,403 --> 01:08:02,947
Do you think
you can understand your mom now?

992
01:08:04,490 --> 01:08:05,408
No.

993
01:08:06,451 --> 01:08:08,661
There's no need for that anymore.

994
01:08:10,872 --> 01:08:12,748
It happened so long ago.

995
01:08:15,042 --> 01:08:16,794
Do you want to know where she is?

996
01:08:16,878 --> 01:08:17,962
It's okay.

997
01:08:19,881 --> 01:08:21,632
I just wanted to know the truth.

998
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:23,593
I never wanted to see her.

999
01:08:25,052 --> 01:08:26,971
Thank you for being honest with me.

1000
01:09:18,022 --> 01:09:19,065
I'm hungry.

1001
01:09:21,484 --> 01:09:22,610
Let's eat.

1002
01:09:34,121 --> 01:09:36,290
- Soybean paste stew?
- Doesn't it smell good?

1003
01:09:36,374 --> 01:09:38,584
Yes, it looks so good. Can I have a bite?

1004
01:09:38,668 --> 01:09:39,710
A bite?

1005
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:45,967
Nice.

1006
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:48,511
I'll cut this too.

1007
01:09:56,686 --> 01:09:59,021
This is mind-blowing.

1008
01:09:59,105 --> 01:10:00,856
Just one bite.

1009
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:07,446
- Enjoy your meal.
- Enjoy your meal.

1010
01:10:12,743 --> 01:10:14,161
Soybean paste stew.

1011
01:10:14,245 --> 01:10:15,204
Rice.

1012
01:10:15,913 --> 01:10:17,456
And rolled omelet.

1013
01:10:23,838 --> 01:10:24,880
This is nice.

1014
01:10:34,223 --> 01:10:36,517
Are you not going to meet your mom?

1015
01:10:43,274 --> 01:10:45,526
I wanted to know why she left me.

1016
01:10:48,404 --> 01:10:49,822
Now I know. That's enough.

1017
01:10:51,866 --> 01:10:54,160
It could've been
because she loved you so much.

1018
01:10:56,662 --> 01:10:58,414
If she loved me,

1019
01:10:58,497 --> 01:11:02,001
she should've stayed by my side
no matter what.

1020
01:11:03,919 --> 01:11:06,547
Whatever the reason may be, she left me.

1021
01:11:08,674 --> 01:11:11,218
That means I didn't mean much in her life.

1022
01:11:16,515 --> 01:11:19,393
There could be another reason
that you're not aware of.

1023
01:11:21,479 --> 01:11:23,189
That's why I wanted you to meet her.

1024
01:11:25,024 --> 01:11:28,110
That way,
you'd be able to know how she felt.

1025
01:11:35,826 --> 01:11:38,871
I don't want to
think about my mom anymore.

1026
01:11:40,748 --> 01:11:41,999
It finally feels

1027
01:11:43,209 --> 01:11:44,877
as if I'm free from her.

1028
01:11:59,558 --> 01:12:01,477
As long as you feel at ease now.

1029
01:12:07,191 --> 01:12:08,234
Yes.

1030
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:10,444
Thank you

1031
01:12:11,946 --> 01:12:13,531
for bringing me all the way here.

1032
01:12:48,399 --> 01:12:51,402
KING THE LAND
