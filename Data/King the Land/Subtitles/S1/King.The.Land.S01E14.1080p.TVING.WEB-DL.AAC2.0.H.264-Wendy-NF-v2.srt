KING THE LAND

00:00:52,449 --> 00:00:54,062
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:54,143 --> 00:00:55,882
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

4
00:01:13,848 --> 00:01:15,600
As long as you feel at ease now.

5
00:01:17,352 --> 00:01:18,395
Thank you

6
00:01:20,438 --> 00:01:22,023
for bringing me all the way here.

7
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:39,666
Yes.

8
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:41,126
They're together.

9
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:43,795
The photos will look nice.

10
00:01:43,878 --> 00:01:45,046
Don't worry.

11
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:46,840
I always protect my informants.

12
00:01:47,966 --> 00:01:50,385
EPISODE 14

13
00:01:58,393 --> 00:01:59,853
<i>It's Tiger Balm.</i>

14
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,564
Apply it to alleviate any type of pain.

15
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,327
That's nice.

16
00:02:18,747 --> 00:02:20,957
Mr. Han, you should try this.

17
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,127
It's from Won. It's nice and cooling.

18
00:02:24,836 --> 00:02:26,212
- Sir.
- Yes?

19
00:02:26,296 --> 00:02:28,131
The media wish to report on Mr. Gu Won.

20
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:29,549
They should.

21
00:02:29,632 --> 00:02:31,259
Of course they should.

22
00:02:31,343 --> 00:02:34,971
For the first time in Korea,
our hotel will launch a global chain.

23
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:37,432
They won't find a better story than that.

24
00:02:38,433 --> 00:02:39,351
It's not that.

25
00:02:39,434 --> 00:02:40,643
It's a love scandal.

26
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:42,604
- Love scandal?
- Yes.

27
00:02:47,859 --> 00:02:50,528
Chairman Han
must have leaked the story first.

28
00:02:50,612 --> 00:02:51,780
It's all right.

29
00:02:52,322 --> 00:02:54,741
They'll get married soon.

30
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,618
That's not the story.

31
00:02:58,286 --> 00:02:59,287
Please take a look.

32
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:09,547
3RD-GEN CHAEBOL'S SECRET LOVE AFFAIR,
KING HOTEL SUCCESSOR AND ORDINARY WOMAN

33
00:03:09,631 --> 00:03:12,133
It'll be published online soon.

34
00:03:13,885 --> 00:03:15,095
Stop it immediately.

35
00:03:15,178 --> 00:03:17,263
Offer to buy ads
or threaten to pull them out.

36
00:03:17,347 --> 00:03:19,015
Stop it at any cost.

37
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,058
Yes, sir.

38
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,107
He'll offer to buy ads
or threaten to pull them out,

39
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,818
but I'll double
whatever my father proposes.

40
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:32,237
So publish the article.

41
00:03:41,496 --> 00:03:44,749
Doesn't our cafeteria taste awful
after we outsourced the catering?

42
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:45,917
Right?

43
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,418
When we had full-time caterers,

44
00:03:47,502 --> 00:03:49,504
I always looked forward to lunch at work.

45
00:03:50,171 --> 00:03:51,923
Do you come to work to eat?

46
00:03:52,006 --> 00:03:54,884
Learn to be thankful
for getting lunch vouchers.

47
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:57,429
You'll only learn
once you start paying for your lunch.

48
00:03:57,512 --> 00:03:58,346
My gosh!

49
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,056
You surprised me.

50
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,058
Why? What is it?

51
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:04,936
There's an article on Mr. Gu.

52
00:04:05,437 --> 00:04:07,480
- What?
- What surprised you so much?

53
00:04:09,899 --> 00:04:10,817
My gosh!

54
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:13,653
"Third-generation chaebol's
secret love affair."

55
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,198
That's a feisty title.

56
00:04:17,282 --> 00:04:18,616
She's an ordinary woman.

57
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,327
He's in love regardless
of her social status. How cool.

58
00:04:21,411 --> 00:04:22,954
I always knew he was manly.

59
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,831
It says she's ordinary,

60
00:04:24,914 --> 00:04:27,000
but she must be
a daughter of a small business.

61
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,168
It's a different world.

62
00:04:28,251 --> 00:04:29,794
Even so, don't you envy her?

63
00:04:29,878 --> 00:04:31,212
Her status just skyrocketed.

64
00:04:31,296 --> 00:04:32,297
- Yes.
- Right.

65
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,799
People like us
wouldn't even have a chance.

66
00:04:34,883 --> 00:04:36,009
Why would you envy her?

67
00:04:36,092 --> 00:04:37,302
Don't even dream about it.

68
00:04:37,385 --> 00:04:39,012
We're still free to dream.

69
00:04:39,095 --> 00:04:40,805
- Isn't that so, Sa-rang?
- Sorry?

70
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:44,851
Why do you ask me that?

71
00:04:44,934 --> 00:04:46,978
Aren't I allowed to ask?

72
00:04:47,896 --> 00:04:49,189
Everyone is too uptight.

73
00:04:49,814 --> 00:04:50,815
But wait.

74
00:04:51,983 --> 00:04:53,526
The woman who got blurred out

75
00:04:55,612 --> 00:04:57,739
kind of looks like Sa-rang.

76
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,459
What do you mean?

77
00:05:10,126 --> 00:05:11,794
No, not at all.

78
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:14,130
No, she reminds me of you.

79
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:16,257
Yes, she has a similar vibe.

80
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,885
- I think so too.
- Right?

81
00:05:18,968 --> 00:05:20,595
- That looks like her.
- The vibe.

82
00:05:20,678 --> 00:05:22,013
- It looks just like her.
- Yes.

83
00:05:22,096 --> 00:05:23,306
- They do look alike.
- Yes.

84
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:24,599
They're similar.

85
00:05:24,682 --> 00:05:26,392
It's not like it's a Magic Eye.

86
00:05:26,476 --> 00:05:28,186
She's all blurred out,

87
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:30,146
so how could you know if I look like her?

88
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,065
- But it looks like her.
- Yes.

89
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:34,359
It can't be Sa-rang.

90
00:05:34,442 --> 00:05:35,568
- Right.
- No way.

91
00:05:35,652 --> 00:05:36,819
- I think it's her.
- Maybe.

92
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:38,321
Anyway, Sa-rang.

93
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,323
Where are you going?

94
00:05:45,286 --> 00:05:46,246
To the restroom.

95
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:47,622
It's that way.

96
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:53,586
I feel like going to the one
that's far away over there.

97
00:05:55,296 --> 00:05:56,339
I get it.

98
00:05:57,006 --> 00:05:58,216
- It makes no sense.
- No.

99
00:05:58,299 --> 00:05:59,592
- It's her.
- It's nonsense.

100
00:06:15,358 --> 00:06:17,026
Are you busy? Were you leaving?

101
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:30,873
Did you see it?

102
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:32,583
Yes, just now.

103
00:06:32,667 --> 00:06:34,168
I got worried,

104
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:36,045
so I was coming over.

105
00:06:39,382 --> 00:06:41,134
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

106
00:06:43,177 --> 00:06:44,387
Did we do something wrong?

107
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:48,016
No, not at all.

108
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:49,517
Exactly.

109
00:06:50,018 --> 00:06:51,769
It's nothing wrong, so don't be sorry.

110
00:06:53,021 --> 00:06:54,564
But the article went out.

111
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,149
Are you okay?

112
00:06:59,235 --> 00:07:00,153
Yes.

113
00:07:01,571 --> 00:07:03,698
I'm not sure yet. I'm still out of it.

114
00:07:04,532 --> 00:07:08,536
But I came to tell you I'm fine
and that you shouldn't worry.

115
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,415
You were worried about me?

116
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,961
Of course. You're the one I love the most.

117
00:07:20,548 --> 00:07:23,217
If something ever happens again,

118
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:26,512
don't hesitate to come find me,
just as you did now.

119
00:07:26,596 --> 00:07:29,015
If you can't come, you can call me.

120
00:07:29,098 --> 00:07:31,809
If I do, will you come over right away?

121
00:07:31,893 --> 00:07:33,019
Of course I will.

122
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:35,188
I'll run over right away.

123
00:07:35,271 --> 00:07:37,607
Whenever it is, wherever you are.

124
00:07:41,444 --> 00:07:42,654
Mr. Gu, this is bad!

125
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:45,281
My gosh, things are worse in here.

126
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:46,949
Sa-rang, you were here.

127
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:48,701
Knock first. This isn't your office.

128
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:52,997
Why are you two here together
in the midst of this turmoil?

129
00:07:53,581 --> 00:07:54,624
Only I get the urgency.

130
00:07:55,249 --> 00:07:57,085
- I get it, so leave for a moment.
- No.

131
00:07:57,168 --> 00:08:00,046
I can't. This is a total emergency.

132
00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:01,089
I'll go.

133
00:08:01,172 --> 00:08:02,590
I have to go back to my shift.

134
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,427
Goodbye, Mr. Yoo.

135
00:08:06,511 --> 00:08:08,513
I mean, Mr. No.

136
00:08:08,596 --> 00:08:09,597
Okay, thanks.

137
00:08:12,975 --> 00:08:14,102
Please take a seat.

138
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,397
What's happened has happened,

139
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,941
so our priority
is to resolve this scandal wisely.

140
00:08:20,024 --> 00:08:21,943
Such a term only applies to gossip.

141
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,529
This isn't a scandal. These were facts.

142
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:26,572
Anyway,

143
00:08:26,656 --> 00:08:29,117
make sure Sa-rang's identity
isn't revealed.

144
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,868
I don't care about me,

145
00:08:30,952 --> 00:08:32,453
- but she must be protected.
- Yes.

146
00:08:32,537 --> 00:08:33,955
I met with the head of the PR team.

147
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:35,873
They'll do whatever they can

148
00:08:35,957 --> 00:08:38,251
to make sure
there aren't more articles on this.

149
00:08:38,334 --> 00:08:40,336
You don't have to worry about that.

150
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,797
The problem is
that this won't be the end of it.

151
00:08:44,882 --> 00:08:45,758
What do you mean?

152
00:08:45,842 --> 00:08:48,928
Why was this article released
at this point in time?

153
00:08:49,637 --> 00:08:51,222
I kept thinking about it

154
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,517
and concluded that it had to be Ms. Gu.

155
00:09:04,235 --> 00:09:05,737
- No Sang-sik.
- Yes.

156
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:10,533
Don't jump to conclusions
unless you're sure.

157
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:13,035
I said it because
I have reason to be suspicious.

158
00:09:14,203 --> 00:09:15,329
A few days ago,

159
00:09:15,413 --> 00:09:16,456
Ms. Gu

160
00:09:17,331 --> 00:09:18,499
summoned me.

161
00:09:24,172 --> 00:09:26,257
Mr. No, you're with me from now on.

162
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:30,219
Make sure you report
everything related to Mr. Gu to me.

163
00:09:33,723 --> 00:09:35,892
What do you mean by everything?

164
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,268
Everything.

165
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:41,272
From his professional life
to his personal life.

166
00:09:41,355 --> 00:09:43,858
Report everything back to me.
Do not leave anything out.

167
00:09:45,735 --> 00:09:46,903
In that case,

168
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,405
how high can I go by helping you?

169
00:09:54,076 --> 00:09:55,244
How's head manager?

170
00:09:56,537 --> 00:09:59,499
Doesn't that sound like a good deal?

171
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:02,460
Head manager?

172
00:10:03,544 --> 00:10:05,254
That's nowhere near enough.

173
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,923
What?

174
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:10,760
I thought you'd offer to make me
president of a subsidiary company.

175
00:10:11,385 --> 00:10:13,596
The head manager's position isn't enough

176
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:16,599
for me to betray my friend.

177
00:10:19,894 --> 00:10:21,354
That trivial friendship?

178
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:24,440
To me,

179
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:28,528
he's too good of a friend
to call him trivial.

180
00:10:29,487 --> 00:10:31,531
I'll pretend I never heard this.

181
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,241
I'm sorry.

182
00:10:39,997 --> 00:10:41,666
<i>She offered me your job</i>

183
00:10:41,749 --> 00:10:43,709
<i>if I reported on your personal life.</i>

184
00:10:43,793 --> 00:10:46,045
When I wasn't shaken,

185
00:10:47,171 --> 00:10:48,297
I suppose

186
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:51,008
she had someone else dig up dirt on you.

187
00:11:07,483 --> 00:11:08,734
Why didn't you accept it?

188
00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:12,405
Exactly. I should've accepted it.

189
00:11:13,447 --> 00:11:14,615
I was just too loyal.

190
00:11:14,699 --> 00:11:16,951
You lost that great chance
over some loyalty?

191
00:11:17,034 --> 00:11:18,870
Exactly, it was a huge miscalculation.

192
00:11:19,453 --> 00:11:20,371
I must be insane.

193
00:11:20,454 --> 00:11:22,164
No Sang-sik, you crazy man. You fool.

194
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:23,833
You should've accepted it.

195
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,376
I must be crazy.

196
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,378
Thanks.

197
00:11:28,462 --> 00:11:29,297
Sorry?

198
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:31,173
Forget it if you missed it.

199
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:33,217
"Thanks." I heard you.

200
00:11:34,468 --> 00:11:37,972
I can't believe I lived long enough
to hear you thank me.

201
00:11:39,181 --> 00:11:40,016
I knew it.

202
00:11:40,808 --> 00:11:41,892
Isn't love great?

203
00:11:41,976 --> 00:11:43,561
Good grief. Get out of here.

204
00:11:44,145 --> 00:11:47,023
I will, but promise me one thing.

205
00:11:47,857 --> 00:11:49,317
Once you become the president,

206
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,110
make me the head manager.

207
00:11:51,193 --> 00:11:53,279
Of course, I know you'll do that.

208
00:12:14,342 --> 00:12:15,384
Okay.

209
00:12:18,346 --> 00:12:19,555
And Mr. Gu?

210
00:12:21,015 --> 00:12:22,141
I'm more grateful.

211
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,077
He told you not to worry,

212
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,953
that the PR team will stop this.

213
00:12:43,037 --> 00:12:44,747
Yes, he did.

214
00:12:45,373 --> 00:12:46,707
It'll be fine, right?

215
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:49,043
The PR team of a major firm
must be well-equipped.

216
00:12:49,126 --> 00:12:51,128
- They'll handle it.
- Of course.

217
00:12:51,212 --> 00:12:53,422
Preventing articles
isn't a big deal for them.

218
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:56,217
What is this?

219
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,052
Why? What is it?

220
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:02,181
Oh my gosh.

221
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,937
"King Group's second Cinderella."

222
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,897
"Will the tragic love story

223
00:13:10,481 --> 00:13:12,024
repeat itself?"

224
00:13:13,401 --> 00:13:14,819
Let me see.

225
00:13:16,946 --> 00:13:18,864
"Chairman Gu Il-hun married

226
00:13:18,948 --> 00:13:21,742
a regular employee of his company,
but it ended in a divorce."

227
00:13:21,826 --> 00:13:25,121
"His son, Head Manager Gu Won,
embarks on the same journey."

228
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:27,915
"His father's romance didn't end happily."

229
00:13:27,998 --> 00:13:30,543
"Will his son be able
to turn this into a happy ending?"

230
00:13:34,755 --> 00:13:36,340
Who wrote this article?

231
00:13:37,591 --> 00:13:39,385
Is something wrong?

232
00:13:39,468 --> 00:13:40,386
No.

233
00:13:40,469 --> 00:13:42,513
I love it.

234
00:13:43,097 --> 00:13:44,348
I wrote the draft.

235
00:13:44,432 --> 00:13:45,933
It's getting lots of attention.

236
00:13:46,016 --> 00:13:49,562
Release more articles
to keep the public's interest aroused.

237
00:13:49,645 --> 00:13:51,272
That family's history

238
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:54,191
is quite interesting.

239
00:13:57,027 --> 00:13:58,279
I mean, Reporter.

240
00:13:58,362 --> 00:14:00,531
You can't publish her photo
without permission!

241
00:14:00,614 --> 00:14:01,949
She has her portrait rights!

242
00:14:02,032 --> 00:14:04,201
Another article just popped up.

243
00:14:04,285 --> 00:14:05,161
Me?

244
00:14:05,703 --> 00:14:07,121
I told you I'm her friend.

245
00:14:07,204 --> 00:14:08,706
Her best friend.

246
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:10,583
I'm stepping in because she's a friend!

247
00:14:11,542 --> 00:14:12,543
Water, please.

248
00:14:13,294 --> 00:14:14,211
Okay.

249
00:14:14,712 --> 00:14:17,256
How many pictures did they take?

250
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:24,722
You can't upload unblurred photos
of an ordinary person like this.

251
00:14:24,805 --> 00:14:26,265
You need to take it down now.

252
00:14:26,348 --> 00:14:27,725
We won't condone this!

253
00:14:29,518 --> 00:14:30,686
No way.

254
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,313
It's still on the main page.

255
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:34,982
He's not even a celebrity.

256
00:14:35,066 --> 00:14:37,276
Why are these articles flooding out?

257
00:14:37,359 --> 00:14:39,695
It seems like a bigger deal
than celebrity news.

258
00:14:40,571 --> 00:14:43,157
A story like this
is easy to get the people gossiping.

259
00:14:45,993 --> 00:14:47,203
Anyway,

260
00:14:48,037 --> 00:14:49,205
I wonder if he's okay.

261
00:14:50,081 --> 00:14:52,249
Who? Mr. Exclamation Mark?

262
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:54,543
Yes.

263
00:14:55,252 --> 00:14:56,295
Excuse me.

264
00:14:56,378 --> 00:14:57,880
You should worry about yourself.

265
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,965
You're the one in a pickle right now.

266
00:15:00,841 --> 00:15:02,593
Well, why should I worry?

267
00:15:02,676 --> 00:15:03,969
It's already out there.

268
00:15:04,053 --> 00:15:06,680
- Worrying won't change anything.
- But this is a relief.

269
00:15:07,431 --> 00:15:08,474
The photos look great.

270
00:15:09,058 --> 00:15:10,309
Yes, they do.

271
00:15:10,392 --> 00:15:12,061
It's like a scene from a drama.

272
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:14,605
Guys, is that so important to you
in this situation?

273
00:15:14,688 --> 00:15:17,858
Hey, people are going on and on
about how you're a Cinderella.

274
00:15:17,942 --> 00:15:19,652
It'd be worse if they bashed your looks.

275
00:15:19,735 --> 00:15:21,028
Sure, they'll insult you anyway,

276
00:15:21,112 --> 00:15:22,988
so one less insult is better.

277
00:15:23,739 --> 00:15:24,949
Why should I be insulted?

278
00:15:25,574 --> 00:15:27,827
Is dating someone
something to be insulted over?

279
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,037
People feel sour when someone does better.

280
00:15:30,121 --> 00:15:32,706
They're probably already
betting on when you'll break up.

281
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,791
She's right.

282
00:15:33,874 --> 00:15:36,127
It's easy to sympathize
with someone worse off,

283
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,754
but it's not easy to applaud
someone better off.

284
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:40,005
Yes.

285
00:15:40,714 --> 00:15:42,133
On that note,

286
00:15:42,216 --> 00:15:43,801
let's give a round of applause!

287
00:15:43,884 --> 00:15:44,718
Congrats.

288
00:15:44,802 --> 00:15:46,262
Congrats.

289
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:52,059
I'm glad I have you two
who will gladly applaud me.

290
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:57,231
KING GROUP'S SECOND CINDERELLA?!

291
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:01,569
Stay away from social media for a while.

292
00:16:01,652 --> 00:16:03,946
- And don't read the comments.
- Right.

293
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:06,448
Don't mind
what these nameless strangers say.

294
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:08,534
Yes, okay.

295
00:16:39,773 --> 00:16:41,400
What do you want for lunch?

296
00:16:41,483 --> 00:16:43,360
- Black bean noodles?
- I'm on a diet.

297
00:16:46,655 --> 00:16:48,157
That's her, right? Mr. Gu's girl.

298
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,117
She's not much. Hey, you're better.

299
00:16:50,701 --> 00:16:51,911
Of course. Don't even.

300
00:16:51,994 --> 00:16:53,579
She has nothing on you.

301
00:17:01,337 --> 00:17:04,381
I always knew Cheon Sa-rang
was up to no good from day one.

302
00:17:04,465 --> 00:17:06,842
She was always flirting with him.
Look what happened.

303
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:08,010
Really?

304
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:10,471
Yes, didn't you see
her big smile with the flowers

305
00:17:10,554 --> 00:17:12,097
at the inaugural ceremony?

306
00:17:12,181 --> 00:17:13,057
I saw it.

307
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,351
It seemed like
she was determined to get him.

308
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:17,353
I feel so bad for Mr. Gu.

309
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:19,313
How did he end up
falling for someone like her?

310
00:17:19,396 --> 00:17:20,940
It won't last long anyway.

311
00:17:21,023 --> 00:17:22,942
Of course. A month at the longest.

312
00:17:23,025 --> 00:17:24,068
Just wait and see.

313
00:17:27,738 --> 00:17:28,822
Hey, Sa-rang.

314
00:17:29,907 --> 00:17:31,116
Get in.

315
00:17:32,701 --> 00:17:33,744
Hello.

316
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,215
Good for you, Sa-rang.

317
00:17:47,716 --> 00:17:50,344
- Sorry?
- Your social status skyrocketed.

318
00:17:50,928 --> 00:17:52,930
What's it like to be on that rocket?

319
00:17:55,516 --> 00:17:56,517
It's not like that.

320
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,726
Don't try to pull that.

321
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,062
You approached him with a motive.

322
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:02,314
You can be honest with me.

323
00:18:02,398 --> 00:18:03,899
How did you pick him up?

324
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:05,609
Share your secrets.

325
00:18:07,778 --> 00:18:08,862
It's not like that.

326
00:18:09,905 --> 00:18:12,533
Please don't make
such careless comments about my business.

327
00:18:12,616 --> 00:18:15,577
Don't deny it.
I read everything on the news.

328
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:16,954
I hit on her.

329
00:18:22,418 --> 00:18:24,128
Hello, Mr. Gu.

330
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,089
I went after her.

331
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:28,674
I hit on her first.

332
00:18:28,757 --> 00:18:30,718
Well, not literally hitting.

333
00:18:32,428 --> 00:18:35,389
So if you want to know some secrets,
you can come to me.

334
00:18:35,973 --> 00:18:38,142
I'll give you a special lesson.

335
00:18:38,225 --> 00:18:39,727
No, it's a misunderstanding.

336
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,937
Misunderstanding or not, remember this.

337
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,857
I'm the one who liked her first.

338
00:18:45,482 --> 00:18:46,775
Got it?

339
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,902
Yes, I'll keep that in mind.

340
00:18:51,447 --> 00:18:52,448
Let's go.

341
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:06,211
From now on,
say confidently that I hit on you first.

342
00:19:06,295 --> 00:19:07,254
Okay?

343
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:10,090
Let's see if you have some good moves.

344
00:19:10,674 --> 00:19:12,176
Not everyone can do that.

345
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:14,928
What do you take me for?

346
00:19:15,012 --> 00:19:16,597
I'm a very deliberate person.

347
00:19:17,181 --> 00:19:18,724
I made a decision to go after you

348
00:19:18,807 --> 00:19:20,476
and planned out my moves.

349
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,393
You didn't know?

350
00:19:21,477 --> 00:19:23,020
I see.

351
00:19:23,103 --> 00:19:24,271
I'm sorry.

352
00:19:24,355 --> 00:19:26,398
Who would believe you?

353
00:19:26,482 --> 00:19:27,900
They'll say I'm a nobody.

354
00:19:29,193 --> 00:19:30,319
A nobody?

355
00:19:31,153 --> 00:19:32,404
From the day I met you,

356
00:19:32,488 --> 00:19:33,781
my world has been

357
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:36,283
full of you.

358
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:38,744
Stop it.

359
00:19:40,871 --> 00:19:42,414
So don't say things like that.

360
00:19:43,332 --> 00:19:46,293
I don't deserve someone like you.

361
00:19:50,464 --> 00:19:51,340
Okay?

362
00:20:10,651 --> 00:20:12,027
Why didn't you do your job?

363
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:13,237
I'm sorry, sir.

364
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:17,491
Tell them to write
as many articles as they want.

365
00:20:17,574 --> 00:20:20,285
But take down all articles
that mention Won's mother.

366
00:20:21,161 --> 00:20:22,913
Tell them that I won't let it slide

367
00:20:22,996 --> 00:20:26,542
not just as the group,
but on a personal level.

368
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,252
Yes, sir.

369
00:20:28,836 --> 00:20:30,921
What about Mr. Gu and Ms. Cheon?

370
00:20:31,004 --> 00:20:32,131
What can I do?

371
00:20:32,756 --> 00:20:34,091
They're in love.

372
00:20:34,675 --> 00:20:36,176
- Sorry?
- Let them be.

373
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:41,056
They'll have to learn
that what they're doing is meaningless.

374
00:20:41,723 --> 00:20:43,016
Yes, sir.

375
00:20:43,725 --> 00:20:46,311
KING GROUP'S SECOND CINDERELLA.
WILL THE TRAGIC LOVE STORY REPEAT ITSELF?

376
00:21:01,034 --> 00:21:01,994
Ro-un.

377
00:21:02,619 --> 00:21:04,496
I got two tickets to a musical.

378
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,873
Want to go over the weekend?

379
00:21:05,956 --> 00:21:07,458
I'm okay.

380
00:21:10,878 --> 00:21:14,256
You know I have feelings for you, right?

381
00:21:16,884 --> 00:21:19,761
I'm sorry. I like someone else.

382
00:21:20,471 --> 00:21:22,097
Is it Pyeong-hwa?

383
00:21:25,726 --> 00:21:27,644
Do I have to answer you?

384
00:21:27,728 --> 00:21:30,939
I want to know exactly why
you're turning me down.

385
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:34,109
Yes, it's her.

386
00:21:39,072 --> 00:21:40,574
As I expected.

387
00:21:40,657 --> 00:21:41,700
Okay.

388
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:55,464
Have you all heard?

389
00:21:56,256 --> 00:21:58,342
One of my colleagues got divorced,

390
00:21:58,425 --> 00:22:01,136
but pretended she was never married
to get promoted and got busted.

391
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,471
So it caused a big scene.

392
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:05,766
My gosh, I can't believe
anyone would do that.

393
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:08,602
Do they have to go that far
just for a promotion?

394
00:22:09,186 --> 00:22:12,689
Isn't it weirder to penalize someone
for getting divorced?

395
00:22:12,773 --> 00:22:14,608
Divorce isn't a crime.

396
00:22:14,691 --> 00:22:17,069
Even so, they still lied.

397
00:22:18,028 --> 00:22:20,072
Don't they feel guilty?

398
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:21,907
What a fraud.

399
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,700
I can't believe that.

400
00:22:23,784 --> 00:22:26,411
How can a team lie to each other?

401
00:22:26,495 --> 00:22:30,165
I'm glad our team
doesn't have someone like that.

402
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:32,834
What? Yes we do.

403
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,045
What? On our team?

404
00:22:35,629 --> 00:22:37,381
Really? No one knows?

405
00:22:47,057 --> 00:22:49,643
Pyeong-hwa, you didn't tell them?

406
00:22:51,561 --> 00:22:55,232
Wait, was your divorce a secret?

407
00:22:57,609 --> 00:22:59,236
Oh, I'm sorry.

408
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:01,154
I thought everyone knew.

409
00:23:01,738 --> 00:23:04,825
You don't have a kid though, do you?

410
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:07,828
Or do you?

411
00:23:07,911 --> 00:23:09,121
Having fun?

412
00:23:09,204 --> 00:23:11,039
Why are you so mad?

413
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:12,874
I was just sharing a fact.

414
00:23:13,709 --> 00:23:15,085
It's all true.

415
00:23:16,878 --> 00:23:19,756
And I know I was your junior,

416
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,052
but you shouldn't use that tone
to the purser.

417
00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:27,389
This is just like you.

418
00:23:35,522 --> 00:23:36,481
Wait.

419
00:23:38,358 --> 00:23:39,359
Wait, Pyeong-hwa.

420
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:44,031
Will you please just go?

421
00:23:45,282 --> 00:23:46,992
I'm incredibly embarrassed right now.

422
00:24:11,933 --> 00:24:12,768
Sa-rang.

423
00:24:14,603 --> 00:24:15,645
Yes, Ha-na.

424
00:24:15,729 --> 00:24:16,897
You should take a break.

425
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,066
You don't have to try so hard around us.

426
00:24:20,108 --> 00:24:21,568
No, it's all right.

427
00:24:21,651 --> 00:24:22,652
She's right.

428
00:24:22,736 --> 00:24:24,780
We got this. You should take a break.

429
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:25,739
Okay?

430
00:24:25,822 --> 00:24:27,199
I'm fine.

431
00:24:27,282 --> 00:24:28,617
You aren't fine.

432
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,911
This is a huge scandal.

433
00:24:30,994 --> 00:24:33,205
Everyone talks about you
no matter where you go.

434
00:24:33,288 --> 00:24:35,040
How could you be okay?

435
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:38,335
The article wasn't written properly.

436
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:47,344
The article was incorrect.

437
00:24:47,969 --> 00:24:49,554
It's not a scandal.

438
00:24:49,638 --> 00:24:50,931
It's a love story.

439
00:24:51,515 --> 00:24:53,809
- I'm sorry, sir.
- No, I should apologize.

440
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:55,477
I'm sorry for causing trouble.

441
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,062
Don't say that.

442
00:24:58,855 --> 00:25:01,233
- Please take these.
- Me?

443
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,984
Thank you.

444
00:25:07,489 --> 00:25:09,574
Please be nice to my girlfriend.

445
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:14,121
I'm asking you as her boyfriend,
not as the head manager.

446
00:25:14,204 --> 00:25:15,455
Please share these.

447
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:16,873
Are you already helping her?

448
00:25:16,957 --> 00:25:17,833
Hey.

449
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:20,168
Mr. Gu, may I share a word?

450
00:25:20,836 --> 00:25:21,795
Yes, please.

451
00:25:22,462 --> 00:25:25,757
Sa-rang is part of King the Land,
and she's our dear family.

452
00:25:26,341 --> 00:25:27,676
Even without your request,

453
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:30,303
we'll look after her
and make sure she isn't hurt.

454
00:25:30,387 --> 00:25:32,139
You don't have to worry so much.

455
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:35,559
Thank you.

456
00:25:38,854 --> 00:25:39,688
Bye.

457
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:46,278
He's so cool.

458
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,655
He's such a romantic.

459
00:25:48,738 --> 00:25:50,824
You must be so happy.

460
00:25:50,907 --> 00:25:52,826
Even a man would fall for him.

461
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,871
- Thanks, Sa-rang.
- Thank you.

462
00:25:56,663 --> 00:25:58,331
Thanks, Sa-rang.

463
00:25:58,415 --> 00:26:00,125
This looks delicious.

464
00:26:00,208 --> 00:26:01,042
It really does.

465
00:26:01,543 --> 00:26:03,879
Did you all see the articles?

466
00:26:05,172 --> 00:26:06,673
What do you think?

467
00:26:07,382 --> 00:26:09,426
I thought it was quite serious.

468
00:26:09,509 --> 00:26:11,511
It wasn't just a regular scandal.

469
00:26:11,595 --> 00:26:12,512
She's our staff.

470
00:26:14,347 --> 00:26:16,266
I met with a few reporters,

471
00:26:16,349 --> 00:26:18,977
and it's highly likely
for the story to take a worse turn.

472
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,061
What do you mean?

473
00:26:21,062 --> 00:26:22,731
That the hotel's successor…

474
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:27,152
is a player who seduces his staff members.

475
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:29,779
I agree with him.

476
00:26:29,863 --> 00:26:32,073
No matter what the facts are,

477
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:34,868
this did have an impact
on the image of our hotel.

478
00:26:34,951 --> 00:26:38,580
I even saw an awful comment that said,

479
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:41,958
"Is King Hotel
more like a motel for couples?"

480
00:26:42,042 --> 00:26:43,627
We, the board of directors,

481
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:46,505
decided to come together

482
00:26:46,588 --> 00:26:48,924
and oppose Mr. Gu's promotion
to president.

483
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:50,800
We should do that.

484
00:26:50,884 --> 00:26:54,471
If the public doesn't approve of him,
our stock price will drop.

485
00:27:02,979 --> 00:27:04,981
Why are you all here together?

486
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:07,067
I see.

487
00:27:07,776 --> 00:27:10,028
You were having a meeting
without telling me.

488
00:27:10,111 --> 00:27:10,946
Yes.

489
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:12,739
The hotel is in trouble.

490
00:27:12,822 --> 00:27:14,991
So? Did the emergency meeting go well?

491
00:27:15,075 --> 00:27:16,368
Yes.

492
00:27:16,451 --> 00:27:19,663
The board members
have something to share with you, sir.

493
00:27:21,248 --> 00:27:23,708
- Really?
- Yes, sir.

494
00:27:23,792 --> 00:27:26,461
Because of Mr. Gu's recent scandal…

495
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:29,256
Hold that thought.
I have something to say too.

496
00:27:29,339 --> 00:27:30,590
May I go first?

497
00:27:32,425 --> 00:27:33,593
Yes, sir.

498
00:27:35,303 --> 00:27:36,763
The articles…

499
00:27:39,516 --> 00:27:40,976
were your doing, weren't they?

500
00:27:46,815 --> 00:27:48,275
A reporter asked,

501
00:27:48,358 --> 00:27:50,318
so I just shared the truth.

502
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:53,572
Did you think
this would make me disappointed in Won

503
00:27:54,614 --> 00:27:56,324
and give everything to you?

504
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:58,159
Don't get ahead of yourself, Father.

505
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:01,955
You have caused greater damage
just for your personal gain!

506
00:28:02,038 --> 00:28:03,373
Get your facts straight.

507
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:05,375
I'm not the one who damaged the hotel.

508
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:07,043
It's Won.

509
00:28:12,465 --> 00:28:16,386
Politics suit you better
than business management.

510
00:28:17,387 --> 00:28:20,849
You're to give up
every position you hold here

511
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:21,891
and leave King Hotel.

512
00:28:21,975 --> 00:28:22,851
Father.

513
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:24,519
Yes, my daughter.

514
00:28:25,604 --> 00:28:27,981
If you want to say something, go ahead.

515
00:28:30,317 --> 00:28:32,193
This was your plan all along.

516
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:35,030
Everything was your son's.

517
00:28:35,989 --> 00:28:38,825
Your honesty is way overdue.

518
00:28:39,618 --> 00:28:41,453
If you have more to say, go ahead.

519
00:28:41,536 --> 00:28:42,996
Like that would change anything.

520
00:28:44,164 --> 00:28:46,333
You don't care about me anyway.

521
00:28:46,416 --> 00:28:48,418
From a long time ago until now,

522
00:28:49,044 --> 00:28:51,504
you've never cared about me,
not even once.

523
00:29:11,775 --> 00:29:13,443
CERTIFICATE OF ACHIEVEMENT
GU HWA-RAN

524
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:17,489
- Hello, Ms. Hwa-ran.
- Where's Dad?

525
00:29:17,572 --> 00:29:18,949
He's on the second floor.

526
00:29:28,249 --> 00:29:29,125
Good job.

527
00:29:29,209 --> 00:29:31,711
Now pass it to your mom. Okay.

528
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:35,048
All right! Good.

529
00:29:35,131 --> 00:29:35,966
- Go.
- Nice.

530
00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:37,550
You can do it this time, Won.

531
00:29:37,634 --> 00:29:39,135
You shoot this time.

532
00:29:39,219 --> 00:29:41,471
- Go, Won.
- It's my turn to block you.

533
00:29:41,554 --> 00:29:42,681
Looking good.

534
00:29:44,265 --> 00:29:46,559
Shoot! Great!

535
00:29:46,643 --> 00:29:47,936
- Won, head it.
- Pass!

536
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:49,270
- Head it!
- Head it!

537
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:51,231
Nice job.

538
00:29:51,314 --> 00:29:52,983
I'm going to score, okay?

539
00:29:53,066 --> 00:29:54,234
Get ready.

540
00:29:54,901 --> 00:29:56,319
Block it, Won. That's right.

541
00:29:57,028 --> 00:29:58,279
Why don't you try shooting?

542
00:29:58,363 --> 00:29:59,656
Hey, it's a goal!

543
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,952
Great job.

544
00:30:05,954 --> 00:30:07,247
Well done.

545
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:11,042
Honey.

546
00:30:39,863 --> 00:30:41,906
Grandma, we're here.

547
00:30:43,491 --> 00:30:45,952
You two aren't even married.

548
00:30:46,036 --> 00:30:47,495
- Don't say "we."
- Ma'am.

549
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:48,747
Your grandson-in-law is here.

550
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:50,915
You're here.

551
00:30:50,999 --> 00:30:53,126
Grandson-in-law candidate number one.

552
00:30:53,209 --> 00:30:56,838
Our relationship got on the news,
so please leave out "candidate."

553
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:58,339
That's what you want.

554
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:00,508
Why are you in such high spirits?

555
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:02,677
Looks like you're the one
who published them.

556
00:31:02,761 --> 00:31:03,970
No.

557
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:05,764
It wasn't me.

558
00:31:05,847 --> 00:31:07,057
I know you did that

559
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,309
to tell everyone
because I wouldn't approve.

560
00:31:10,226 --> 00:31:11,853
I'm not that crafty.

561
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:13,730
You already know he wouldn't.

562
00:31:13,813 --> 00:31:16,649
Goodness, you're already taking his side?

563
00:31:16,733 --> 00:31:18,068
Do you like him that much?

564
00:31:18,985 --> 00:31:20,278
My gosh.

565
00:31:20,361 --> 00:31:21,780
Well, I'll be.

566
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:24,532
Come this way.

567
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:39,422
If you ever make Sa-rang cry,

568
00:31:40,507 --> 00:31:42,383
I'm going to kill you.

569
00:31:43,051 --> 00:31:45,553
That will be the last day of your life,

570
00:31:46,346 --> 00:31:48,014
so remember that.

571
00:31:50,683 --> 00:31:52,602
I will never let that happen

572
00:31:52,685 --> 00:31:54,229
and be good to her.

573
00:31:57,899 --> 00:31:59,192
Stop smiling.

574
00:31:59,275 --> 00:32:00,902
Don't. You might grow on me.

575
00:32:01,861 --> 00:32:03,029
What should I begin with?

576
00:32:03,113 --> 00:32:04,405
Peeling onions?

577
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,284
If you're dying to help,
get changed first.

578
00:32:09,244 --> 00:32:11,287
- Yes.
- I saw a car parked outside.

579
00:32:11,371 --> 00:32:12,789
Is your rich grandson-in-law…

580
00:32:13,456 --> 00:32:15,667
He <i>is</i> here.

581
00:32:17,085 --> 00:32:20,130
I had no idea
you were such an established man.

582
00:32:20,213 --> 00:32:22,423
I should've noticed back then.

583
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:23,716
One moment.

584
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:26,177
Have one. Drink up.

585
00:32:27,262 --> 00:32:28,513
Thank you.

586
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,766
He's here.

587
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,560
Do you even have to ask?

588
00:32:33,643 --> 00:32:36,312
Our town's rich grandson-in-law.

589
00:32:41,818 --> 00:32:43,278
Please take this.

590
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:46,114
Sa-rang is such a big shot now.

591
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:47,615
Okay.

592
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:49,075
Take a nice picture.

593
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:51,244
- A photo?
- Yes.

594
00:32:51,327 --> 00:32:53,705
Why do you want a picture?

595
00:32:53,788 --> 00:32:55,290
He's just a candidate.

596
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:57,167
Candidate or not,

597
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:00,170
it's my first time
seeing a chaebol in real life.

598
00:33:01,087 --> 00:33:03,131
- Take it.
- Just one?

599
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:05,383
One, two, three.

600
00:33:05,466 --> 00:33:07,302
- Okay.
- One more.

601
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:09,053
Just take one. We're all waiting.

602
00:33:09,137 --> 00:33:10,930
Yes, one per person.

603
00:33:11,014 --> 00:33:13,141
You know me, right?
The ginseng chicken soup.

604
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:14,267
Yes.

605
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,686
Give me your autograph.
I'll put it on the wall.

606
00:33:16,769 --> 00:33:18,146
I don't have an autograph.

607
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:20,565
It's simple. Write out
three syllables of your name.

608
00:33:20,648 --> 00:33:22,567
- Come on.
- I only have two syllables.

609
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:24,068
Yes, two.

610
00:33:25,653 --> 00:33:27,906
And write down, "The soup is savory

611
00:33:27,989 --> 00:33:29,866
and the meat is amazing."

612
00:33:29,949 --> 00:33:30,992
Just do it.

613
00:33:32,035 --> 00:33:34,037
- "The soup is…"
- Savory.

614
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,079
The meat is amazing.

615
00:33:35,163 --> 00:33:36,414
"The meat is…"

616
00:33:36,497 --> 00:33:39,125
- He's so handsome.
- His penmanship is impressive too.

617
00:33:39,209 --> 00:33:40,877
- Okay, a selfie.
- Me too.

618
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,128
You look great.

619
00:33:44,464 --> 00:33:45,840
- My gosh.
- My turn.

620
00:33:45,924 --> 00:33:47,550
- Mine too.
- Give me one too.

621
00:33:47,634 --> 00:33:48,760
Your autograph.

622
00:33:48,843 --> 00:33:49,719
Sign here.

623
00:33:49,802 --> 00:33:51,304
- Write "I love you."
- Here.

624
00:33:51,387 --> 00:33:52,305
Aunties.

625
00:33:52,388 --> 00:33:53,681
That's enough.

626
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:56,184
Then you should line up.

627
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:57,435
- Do one for me.
- Me too.

628
00:33:57,518 --> 00:33:59,854
What autograph?

629
00:34:02,649 --> 00:34:04,859
Why are you frowning?

630
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:06,778
Let's make the picture look good.

631
00:34:06,861 --> 00:34:09,239
Do it quickly.
I have to open for business.

632
00:34:09,322 --> 00:34:10,782
One, two.

633
00:34:11,532 --> 00:34:13,409
- I'm taking it.
- Okay.

634
00:34:25,088 --> 00:34:26,089
Move aside.

635
00:34:27,924 --> 00:34:31,094
As soon as I get a job, it's over for you.

636
00:34:31,177 --> 00:34:34,347
You should've been good to Mom
while she was nice.

637
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:36,557
You reap what you sow.
It's your punishment.

638
00:34:37,892 --> 00:34:41,104
- Where did you learn those words?
- You always said that to Mom.

639
00:34:42,063 --> 00:34:43,022
Dad.

640
00:34:43,106 --> 00:34:44,691
You should wipe that place too.

641
00:34:44,774 --> 00:34:46,818
Make it look sparkling clean.

642
00:34:52,365 --> 00:34:53,700
Darn it!

643
00:34:53,783 --> 00:34:55,576
There's no end to these chores!

644
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,328
That's the thing with chores.

645
00:34:57,412 --> 00:35:00,123
Your work doesn't really show,
and no one gives you credit.

646
00:35:01,207 --> 00:35:02,417
What are you doing?

647
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,043
Cho-rong told you to wipe there.

648
00:35:07,422 --> 00:35:10,258
Cho-rong, Grandma is home.

649
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:11,342
Mom.

650
00:35:12,093 --> 00:35:14,262
- Mom.
- What's going on?

651
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:16,973
Why is my son holding a rag?

652
00:35:18,308 --> 00:35:19,309
You're home, Mother.

653
00:35:19,392 --> 00:35:20,893
Forget your greetings.

654
00:35:20,977 --> 00:35:24,147
Why is the head of this household
holding a rag in his hand?

655
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:26,941
I can't believe
I lived long enough to see this nonsense.

656
00:35:27,025 --> 00:35:29,110
I must've lived for too long.

657
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:30,278
Good grief.

658
00:35:30,778 --> 00:35:33,239
This house is such a mess.

659
00:35:35,158 --> 00:35:38,369
Father, Mother,
I have something to say to you.

660
00:35:38,453 --> 00:35:39,704
As if.

661
00:35:39,787 --> 00:35:41,289
- Gosh.
- I want coffee.

662
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:44,167
Red ginseng honey tea
for Father and Mother.

663
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,753
Look at her.

664
00:35:49,505 --> 00:35:50,506
My son

665
00:35:51,466 --> 00:35:53,384
- really did that?
- Yes.

666
00:35:53,468 --> 00:35:54,802
Your son did that.

667
00:35:55,303 --> 00:35:58,431
He didn't tell us that he quit his job,
used up his severance pay,

668
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,975
and even took out a loan.

669
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:03,686
It wasn't a loan. It was a cash advance.

670
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:05,813
You punk. Shut your mouth.

671
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:07,440
Mom, indoor golf.

672
00:36:07,523 --> 00:36:08,775
- Nice shot!
- Right.

673
00:36:08,858 --> 00:36:10,568
He even played golf with that money.

674
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,945
Da-eul, listen up.

675
00:36:13,946 --> 00:36:16,532
You are no longer our daughter-in-law.

676
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:21,913
You're the head of our household.

677
00:36:21,996 --> 00:36:23,039
Dad.

678
00:36:24,165 --> 00:36:24,999
Have you eaten?

679
00:36:26,167 --> 00:36:27,168
Not yet.

680
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:29,170
The head of our household can't go hungry!

681
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:32,840
What are you doing?
The head of our household hasn't eaten.

682
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:34,050
Get cooking.

683
00:36:36,135 --> 00:36:38,179
Me?

684
00:36:39,305 --> 00:36:40,264
Mom!

685
00:36:40,348 --> 00:36:42,475
Will you clean the house all day?

686
00:36:42,558 --> 00:36:43,434
Go cook!

687
00:36:43,518 --> 00:36:45,436
The head of the household must eat well

688
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,897
for our home to be in great condition.

689
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:52,944
Whatever. You do it, Mom.

690
00:36:53,027 --> 00:36:55,613
You punk.

691
00:36:55,696 --> 00:36:56,656
Grandma, nice shot!

692
00:36:56,739 --> 00:36:59,659
Go make dinner!

693
00:36:59,742 --> 00:37:01,577
Stop pestering me about food!

694
00:37:03,746 --> 00:37:05,748
As for the hotel chain business,

695
00:37:05,832 --> 00:37:08,292
handle every step yourself.

696
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:11,337
Yes, I plan on doing that.

697
00:37:11,421 --> 00:37:13,673
Don't send your staff overseas.

698
00:37:13,756 --> 00:37:15,466
You should go abroad yourself.

699
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,717
Yes.

700
00:37:17,927 --> 00:37:18,928
Okay.

701
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:21,722
I need to get some rest.

702
00:37:25,768 --> 00:37:26,853
Why…

703
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:29,480
won't you ask me anything?

704
00:37:32,442 --> 00:37:35,445
If I do, will anything change?

705
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:38,865
No.

706
00:37:41,117 --> 00:37:43,411
There are high expectations
for the chain business.

707
00:37:44,162 --> 00:37:45,329
That also means

708
00:37:45,413 --> 00:37:48,082
many are jealous of you.

709
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:52,003
Bring back good results
without making mistakes.

710
00:37:53,588 --> 00:37:55,590
Yes, I'll do that.

711
00:38:38,466 --> 00:38:40,468
Our best talent. Have you been well?

712
00:38:41,135 --> 00:38:43,471
Yes, sir. Have you been well too?

713
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:45,932
It's always the same for me.

714
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:50,228
Allow me to serve your meal.

715
00:38:50,311 --> 00:38:51,270
Okay.

716
00:39:04,534 --> 00:39:06,285
When will your other party join you?

717
00:39:06,786 --> 00:39:09,372
Should I warm up the rice and soup later?

718
00:39:10,373 --> 00:39:11,374
Sit down.

719
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:13,543
That's your seat.

720
00:39:14,835 --> 00:39:17,421
- Me?
- I came here to treat

721
00:39:17,505 --> 00:39:19,257
our best talent to a meal.

722
00:39:20,383 --> 00:39:22,093
Why? Do you feel uncomfortable?

723
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:24,762
No, sir.

724
00:39:32,687 --> 00:39:36,107
You do know you're very dear to me, right?

725
00:39:37,525 --> 00:39:40,570
Yes, sir. I'm always grateful for that.

726
00:39:42,363 --> 00:39:44,198
I understand why Won likes you.

727
00:39:45,074 --> 00:39:47,827
And it's scarier because of that.

728
00:39:54,417 --> 00:39:55,793
You two aren't kids,

729
00:39:56,544 --> 00:39:58,296
so I won't tell you to break up.

730
00:39:59,338 --> 00:40:00,298
Instead,

731
00:40:00,923 --> 00:40:04,427
go somewhere quiet
until things settle down.

732
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:15,021
Is this a request or an order?

733
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,188
It's an order

734
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:19,275
as the chairman of King Hotel.

735
00:40:25,323 --> 00:40:28,534
If it's your order, I must do as you say.

736
00:40:30,745 --> 00:40:33,372
Once you think things over away from him,

737
00:40:33,456 --> 00:40:37,877
you'll realize what the best decision is.

738
00:40:40,254 --> 00:40:42,506
I'm sorry. Let's eat.

739
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:43,716
It's getting cold.

740
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:14,163
My gosh.

741
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,125
- Did I keep you waiting?
- No.

742
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,505
Your face is cold.

743
00:41:22,588 --> 00:41:24,548
I told you to wait somewhere warm.

744
00:41:24,632 --> 00:41:26,050
The breeze was refreshing.

745
00:41:29,178 --> 00:41:30,346
Is something going on?

746
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:34,642
No.

747
00:41:35,434 --> 00:41:37,186
But you look so…

748
00:41:38,104 --> 00:41:39,146
Why?

749
00:41:39,772 --> 00:41:40,981
Do I look that ugly?

750
00:41:45,194 --> 00:41:47,363
What kind of nonsense is that?

751
00:42:00,501 --> 00:42:02,044
It's so cozy and nice.

752
00:42:04,046 --> 00:42:05,131
I agree.

753
00:42:11,303 --> 00:42:12,346
Anyway,

754
00:42:13,514 --> 00:42:15,516
we can't meet for a while.

755
00:42:16,392 --> 00:42:17,810
I have a business trip abroad.

756
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:19,895
For how long?

757
00:42:19,979 --> 00:42:21,355
About three weeks.

758
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:25,443
That's not so bad.

759
00:42:25,526 --> 00:42:26,652
I just said three weeks.

760
00:42:27,445 --> 00:42:30,281
That's almost a month.
You're okay with that?

761
00:42:30,364 --> 00:42:32,199
I already miss you to death.

762
00:42:34,827 --> 00:42:36,287
You're leaving to work.

763
00:42:38,372 --> 00:42:39,707
Go do a great job.

764
00:42:42,209 --> 00:42:43,043
Okay.

765
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:45,629
I'll do my best.

766
00:42:47,715 --> 00:42:48,716
But still,

767
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:51,927
since we can't meet for a while,

768
00:42:53,304 --> 00:42:54,722
don't go home tonight.

769
00:42:56,098 --> 00:42:57,391
What are we going to do?

770
00:43:02,897 --> 00:43:03,773
Let's go somewhere.

771
00:43:06,192 --> 00:43:07,443
At this hour?

772
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:09,195
Where?

773
00:43:19,205 --> 00:43:21,373
See? I told you.

774
00:43:21,457 --> 00:43:23,584
I knew it'd be closed.

775
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:26,086
You're right. It's closed.

776
00:43:27,713 --> 00:43:28,631
Let's go.

777
00:43:29,757 --> 00:43:30,841
Wait.

778
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:33,844
Ta-da.

779
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:51,028
Wait.

780
00:43:52,112 --> 00:43:53,739
Did you rent out the entire place?

781
00:43:54,323 --> 00:43:55,366
Wait.

782
00:43:55,449 --> 00:43:56,867
I rented out the entire place.

783
00:43:58,786 --> 00:44:00,788
Why? Do you not like amusement parks?

784
00:44:00,871 --> 00:44:02,414
No, I love them!

785
00:44:03,415 --> 00:44:04,542
It's so pretty.

786
00:44:05,584 --> 00:44:06,418
Let's go.

787
00:44:07,002 --> 00:44:08,796
Our night has just begun.

788
00:44:43,154 --> 00:44:44,280
- Let's go.
- Go.

789
00:44:57,252 --> 00:44:58,795
Why would anyone ride that?

790
00:44:58,878 --> 00:45:01,131
Why would you come here
if not to go on the rides?

791
00:45:01,214 --> 00:45:03,717
Well, you just come for the vibe.

792
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,302
What are you talking about?

793
00:45:06,386 --> 00:45:08,722
We're already here,
so we have to go on the rides.

794
00:45:08,805 --> 00:45:10,348
Let's go.

795
00:45:14,185 --> 00:45:15,562
Wait, are you scared?

796
00:45:19,649 --> 00:45:23,027
I'm a guy who doesn't know
what getting scared means.

797
00:45:24,195 --> 00:45:26,698
- But you look scared.
- Come on.

798
00:45:26,781 --> 00:45:28,408
I even go skydiving.

799
00:45:28,491 --> 00:45:30,493
That's so cool. So let's go.

800
00:45:40,211 --> 00:45:41,755
What now?

801
00:45:43,757 --> 00:45:45,467
I thought about it,

802
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:48,678
and I should stay down here
to take pictures of you.

803
00:45:49,971 --> 00:45:52,515
Don't get on if you're scared.
I can go alone.

804
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:53,683
Wait.

805
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:57,187
Let's go.

806
00:46:07,697 --> 00:46:08,531
Not here.

807
00:46:19,709 --> 00:46:21,169
- Are you crying?
- No.

808
00:46:54,869 --> 00:46:56,579
Don't go on rides if you're scared.

809
00:46:57,288 --> 00:46:58,623
I'm not scared.

810
00:46:58,706 --> 00:47:01,292
I was just that thirsty.

811
00:47:01,376 --> 00:47:04,295
If you go skydiving,
why are you scared of this?

812
00:47:04,879 --> 00:47:06,464
That's very different.

813
00:47:07,632 --> 00:47:10,301
Up there, I make the choice to jump.

814
00:47:10,385 --> 00:47:13,680
But leaving my life
in the hands of that machine

815
00:47:13,763 --> 00:47:15,181
is a totally different story.

816
00:47:16,182 --> 00:47:17,267
It's different.

817
00:47:26,985 --> 00:47:28,027
Thank you

818
00:47:28,778 --> 00:47:30,530
for trying to do everything with me.

819
00:47:33,908 --> 00:47:35,076
Of course I should.

820
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:38,204
I'll always do everything with you.

821
00:47:41,332 --> 00:47:42,959
Good luck with your business trip.

822
00:47:43,042 --> 00:47:46,129
If you miss me, tell me right away.

823
00:47:46,212 --> 00:47:48,214
I'll give up everything and fly back.

824
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:49,132
Okay?

825
00:47:51,175 --> 00:47:53,052
Don't worry about me.

826
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:54,888
Finish your job and take your time.

827
00:47:56,222 --> 00:47:57,432
Okay.

828
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,061
- Let's go if you're done.
- What?

829
00:48:03,146 --> 00:48:04,272
- Already?
- Yes.

830
00:48:04,939 --> 00:48:07,609
- We have many more to ride.
- I'm not done yet.

831
00:48:07,692 --> 00:48:10,278
I'm not done yet. Let's take a break.

832
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:14,449
Get up now.

833
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:16,367
Yes, ma'am!

834
00:48:18,536 --> 00:48:19,662
Attaboy.

835
00:49:13,925 --> 00:49:14,968
<i>I'm on my flight.</i>

836
00:49:15,051 --> 00:49:16,552
<i>I'll be back.</i>

837
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:18,262
<i>I love you.</i>

838
00:49:29,524 --> 00:49:30,942
<i>Have a nice trip.</i>

839
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:43,579
<i>I love you too.</i>

840
00:50:29,542 --> 00:50:33,296
KING TOURIST HOTEL

841
00:51:10,041 --> 00:51:14,545
MANAGEMENT POLICY
CUSTOMER SATISFACTION

842
00:51:21,969 --> 00:51:23,054
Hello.

843
00:51:25,848 --> 00:51:27,391
- Bo-yeon.
- What?

844
00:51:27,475 --> 00:51:28,893
It's you, Cheon Sa-rang.

845
00:51:29,727 --> 00:51:32,355
- Have you been well?
- Why are you here?

846
00:51:33,815 --> 00:51:35,441
I was appointed here.

847
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:37,777
Stop talking nonsense.

848
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:40,655
This isn't a place for people like you.

849
00:51:42,031 --> 00:51:43,407
Who are people like me?

850
00:51:43,491 --> 00:51:45,785
Big shots like you.

851
00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:48,329
You made it to King the Land, didn't you?

852
00:51:50,081 --> 00:51:52,291
Only the worst transgressors end up here.

853
00:51:58,965 --> 00:52:01,217
Is this that…

854
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:02,426
Yes, you're right.

855
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:06,347
The place you can't escape
once you get in,

856
00:52:06,430 --> 00:52:09,225
the infamous place of exile,
King Tourist Hotel.

857
00:52:15,857 --> 00:52:18,442
Why are you here?

858
00:52:18,526 --> 00:52:20,653
Don't ask. It breaks my heart.

859
00:52:20,736 --> 00:52:23,573
Someone else got fired
from the room inspection team.

860
00:52:23,656 --> 00:52:24,615
Again? Why?

861
00:52:24,699 --> 00:52:25,908
For being fat.

862
00:52:25,992 --> 00:52:28,411
That's why I told everyone

863
00:52:28,494 --> 00:52:30,580
to stay out of Ms. Gu's way
when she shows up.

864
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,707
They never get the hang of it.

865
00:52:34,375 --> 00:52:37,086
But Ms. Gu's too much too.

866
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:39,630
She wants to fit everyone
in a certain size.

867
00:52:41,883 --> 00:52:43,009
Hello, ma'am!

868
00:52:46,846 --> 00:52:48,181
Get rid of her.

869
00:52:52,643 --> 00:52:53,728
Follow me.

870
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:04,822
You know that a tourist hotel
is different from a regular hotel, right?

871
00:53:04,906 --> 00:53:05,823
Yes.

872
00:53:05,907 --> 00:53:08,618
Hotels abide by the Public Health Act
as a lodging business,

873
00:53:08,701 --> 00:53:10,828
but tourist hotels are
tourist accommodation businesses

874
00:53:10,912 --> 00:53:12,955
under the Tourism Promotion Act.

875
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:14,790
You have the answer to everything,

876
00:53:14,874 --> 00:53:16,459
just as you always do.

877
00:53:16,542 --> 00:53:18,044
It's because I was taught well

878
00:53:18,127 --> 00:53:20,880
from the very best when I began.

879
00:53:21,756 --> 00:53:23,507
It's all thanks to you.

880
00:53:24,967 --> 00:53:27,261
You've become good with words
while I was gone.

881
00:53:27,887 --> 00:53:30,932
This is the lowest subsidiary
among King Group,

882
00:53:31,015 --> 00:53:33,351
but there is one good thing
about this place.

883
00:53:33,434 --> 00:53:34,810
Board and lodging for staff.

884
00:53:48,074 --> 00:53:50,076
Use the bed by the window.

885
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:51,702
There's a uniform in the closet,

886
00:53:51,786 --> 00:53:53,663
so get changed and come to the lobby.

887
00:53:54,622 --> 00:53:55,665
Okay.

888
00:54:00,211 --> 00:54:01,254
Sa-rang.

889
00:54:02,088 --> 00:54:03,297
I saw the news.

890
00:54:06,842 --> 00:54:08,469
I saw it too.

891
00:54:09,053 --> 00:54:12,848
Everyone here was kicked out,
so we're like family here.

892
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:14,892
You don't have to worry.

893
00:55:23,794 --> 00:55:28,341
CHEON SA-RANG

894
00:55:36,307 --> 00:55:37,350
Hermès.

895
00:55:58,579 --> 00:56:00,623
Are you okay? Is everything fine?

896
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:06,337
Pretty much, other than the fact
that my entire team knows now.

897
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:09,006
But you know, secrets don't last forever.

898
00:56:09,548 --> 00:56:12,301
I was always worried
about when it would get out.

899
00:56:12,385 --> 00:56:14,178
I think this is for the better.

900
00:56:14,261 --> 00:56:16,430
Byeong-gu will stop blackmailing me too.

901
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:18,516
What about Ro-un?

902
00:56:21,602 --> 00:56:22,770
He's just a junior.

903
00:56:24,647 --> 00:56:25,856
What about you?

904
00:56:26,399 --> 00:56:28,192
Is Chung-jae looking for a job?

905
00:56:28,275 --> 00:56:30,361
No idea. He'll figure it out on his own.

906
00:56:30,986 --> 00:56:33,406
He stopped going to indoor golf though.

907
00:56:33,489 --> 00:56:35,658
Cho-rong says people never change,

908
00:56:35,741 --> 00:56:36,784
but what can I do?

909
00:56:37,493 --> 00:56:39,161
She said that?

910
00:56:39,245 --> 00:56:40,454
Hey, she's better than me.

911
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:46,627
Sa-rang loves this.

912
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:47,920
Seriously.

913
00:56:48,629 --> 00:56:50,548
I wonder if she's eating all right.

914
00:56:52,508 --> 00:56:53,676
Should we call her?

915
00:56:54,468 --> 00:56:56,178
She's too busy. She rarely picks up.

916
00:56:56,971 --> 00:56:59,265
It's been two weeks,
and she hasn't visited Seoul.

917
00:57:00,391 --> 00:57:01,600
She'll return soon, right?

918
00:57:02,935 --> 00:57:04,019
No idea.

919
00:57:05,229 --> 00:57:07,314
I have a feeling something is going on.

920
00:57:11,735 --> 00:57:12,820
What is this?

921
00:57:13,529 --> 00:57:14,738
Are you moving?

922
00:57:15,448 --> 00:57:16,449
No, a business trip.

923
00:57:17,032 --> 00:57:19,452
How long could that be
for you to pack so much?

924
00:57:19,535 --> 00:57:21,829
I wonder. When will I come back?

925
00:57:24,206 --> 00:57:25,374
What is it?

926
00:57:27,918 --> 00:57:29,044
I'll be back.

927
00:57:29,628 --> 00:57:31,005
Let's talk then.

928
00:57:33,132 --> 00:57:36,177
She said she'd tell us
when she's back, so let's wait.

929
00:57:36,802 --> 00:57:39,555
Right, she's not the type
who shares these things.

930
00:57:39,638 --> 00:57:40,681
Exactly.

931
00:57:40,765 --> 00:57:43,392
I'm sure she's troubled alone,
pretending to be fine.

932
00:57:48,022 --> 00:57:49,148
Why don't we go see her?

933
00:57:50,357 --> 00:57:52,276
- Shall we?
- Yes.

934
00:57:52,359 --> 00:57:54,570
- When is your day off?
- What about you?

935
00:57:54,653 --> 00:57:55,613
One second.

936
00:57:57,114 --> 00:57:58,908
KING TOURIST HOTEL

937
00:57:58,991 --> 00:58:01,160
You're checked in. Enjoy your stay.

938
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,541
- Sa-rang.
- Yes?

939
00:58:07,625 --> 00:58:10,044
The restaurant needs backup
and called for help.

940
00:58:10,127 --> 00:58:11,378
You should go.

941
00:58:11,462 --> 00:58:12,630
All right.

942
00:58:27,812 --> 00:58:29,605
Hey, miss!

943
00:58:30,773 --> 00:58:31,690
Yes?

944
00:58:31,774 --> 00:58:35,069
We stayed here for over three hours

945
00:58:35,152 --> 00:58:37,446
and refilled our coffee twice.

946
00:58:37,530 --> 00:58:38,739
Is there anything on the house?

947
00:58:38,823 --> 00:58:41,242
What kind of hotel is this?

948
00:58:41,826 --> 00:58:44,370
You didn't order anything else,
but just coffee?

949
00:58:44,453 --> 00:58:45,329
Why?

950
00:58:45,412 --> 00:58:47,873
Coffee is enough.
What more are you trying to sell?

951
00:58:48,666 --> 00:58:50,835
Good grief, you charge 10,000 won

952
00:58:50,918 --> 00:58:54,046
for this bitter coffee
just because you call yourself a hotel.

953
00:58:54,129 --> 00:58:56,924
Where's your conscience? Isn't that so?

954
00:58:59,176 --> 00:59:00,219
Exactly.

955
00:59:01,303 --> 00:59:05,182
Your stomach must hurt so much
from drinking just bitter coffee.

956
00:59:05,266 --> 00:59:08,477
I'll bring some hot water
and a few cookies in secret.

957
00:59:10,312 --> 00:59:13,732
It must be because she's from Seoul.
There's some talking to her.

958
00:59:14,817 --> 00:59:16,026
You are

959
00:59:16,986 --> 00:59:18,112
very clever.

960
00:59:19,113 --> 00:59:21,073
Please give me a moment.

961
00:59:26,207 --> 00:59:27,750
I missed the smell of Seoul.

962
00:59:28,501 --> 00:59:29,543
This is so nice.

963
00:59:30,378 --> 00:59:31,504
Wait.

964
00:59:32,088 --> 00:59:33,422
Are you calling Sa-rang?

965
00:59:33,506 --> 00:59:34,715
I should tell her I'm here.

966
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:37,301
You're going to call her
after three weeks?

967
00:59:37,385 --> 00:59:39,595
You should just show up and surprise her.

968
00:59:40,596 --> 00:59:43,265
Every moment of a relationship
should be special.

969
00:59:43,349 --> 00:59:46,519
How did you start dating her
without knowing a thing?

970
00:59:46,602 --> 00:59:48,980
You can talk to me again
once you try dating.

971
00:59:50,439 --> 00:59:53,943
Who says I've never dated?

972
00:59:58,823 --> 01:00:00,491
Everyone at the hotel knows.

973
01:00:01,993 --> 01:00:02,827
Really?

974
01:00:12,044 --> 01:00:14,171
<i>The person you have called is unavailable.</i>

975
01:00:14,255 --> 01:00:16,841
<i>Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

976
01:00:21,637 --> 01:00:23,180
<i>I arrived at the airport.</i>

977
01:00:24,807 --> 01:00:25,891
<i>I miss you.</i>

978
01:01:23,491 --> 01:01:25,117
Hello, Mr. Gu.

979
01:01:25,201 --> 01:01:26,619
How was your business trip?

980
01:01:26,702 --> 01:01:29,121
Good. Where's Sa-rang?

981
01:01:29,205 --> 01:01:31,457
She was reappointed.

982
01:01:33,667 --> 01:01:35,086
- Reappointed?
- Yes.

983
01:01:35,169 --> 01:01:36,921
I only heard it from my manager.

984
01:01:37,004 --> 01:01:37,838
To where?

985
01:01:37,922 --> 01:01:39,882
I'm not so sure.

986
01:02:07,535 --> 01:02:08,452
Ha-na.

987
01:02:10,704 --> 01:02:13,290
When I first came to this hotel,

988
01:02:15,376 --> 01:02:17,002
I said something like this.

989
01:02:18,129 --> 01:02:19,255
That from now on,

990
01:02:20,506 --> 01:02:25,636
I'll make this hotel
a place without fake smiles.

991
01:02:30,224 --> 01:02:31,517
Is that smile…

992
01:02:33,769 --> 01:02:34,937
genuine?

993
01:02:39,608 --> 01:02:41,360
I'm sorry, Mr. Gu.

994
01:02:42,611 --> 01:02:45,948
We were ordered
not to share a word regarding Sa-rang.

995
01:02:57,459 --> 01:02:59,086
Where is Ms. Cheon Sa-rang?

996
01:03:01,964 --> 01:03:03,424
Who reappointed her?

997
01:03:04,008 --> 01:03:06,552
We do not know who reappointed her.

998
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:09,930
I just know
she went to King Tourist Hotel.

999
01:03:10,556 --> 01:03:13,017
- King Tourist Hotel?
- Yes.

1000
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:15,019
It's been about three weeks.

1001
01:03:15,102 --> 01:03:16,604
Three weeks?

1002
01:03:17,438 --> 01:03:19,690
- Is something going on?
- No.

1003
01:03:19,773 --> 01:03:21,984
Don't worry about me.

1004
01:03:22,067 --> 01:03:24,111
Finish your job and take your time.

1005
01:03:26,447 --> 01:03:28,824
Okay. Thank you.

1006
01:03:46,258 --> 01:03:47,259
Won.

1007
01:04:36,225 --> 01:04:37,268
Won.

1008
01:04:45,943 --> 01:04:47,278
This…

1009
01:04:48,195 --> 01:04:49,989
is a pocket watch.

1010
01:04:50,072 --> 01:04:51,532
Don't lose it.

1011
01:04:51,615 --> 01:04:52,866
Okay.

1012
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:54,535
Always keep it on you.

1013
01:04:55,286 --> 01:04:56,578
Of course.

1014
01:05:03,252 --> 01:05:05,129
Mom, what's wrong?

1015
01:05:06,797 --> 01:05:07,881
Nothing.

1016
01:05:21,979 --> 01:05:23,022
Won.

1017
01:05:25,482 --> 01:05:26,650
It's me, Mom.

1018
01:05:46,754 --> 01:05:49,757
KING THE LAND

1019
01:06:22,623 --> 01:06:24,083
<i>I'm sorry I'm late.</i>

1020
01:06:24,166 --> 01:06:27,086
<i>You should be in King the Land.</i>

1021
01:06:27,169 --> 01:06:28,420
<i>Let's go back now.</i>

1022
01:06:29,004 --> 01:06:31,673
Don't drive Won into a corner anymore.

1023
01:06:31,757 --> 01:06:34,093
Let him live his life the way he wants to.

1024
01:06:34,176 --> 01:06:35,344
<i>What did you do?</i>

1025
01:06:35,427 --> 01:06:38,097
<i>This is why you can't be loved.</i>

1026
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:40,933
<i>It is a design
that symbolizes unchanging love.</i>

1027
01:06:41,016 --> 01:06:43,143
I have something I want to say today.

1028
01:06:43,727 --> 01:06:46,397
I gave her money and she left on her own.

1029
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:47,523
<i>What cheap love.</i>
