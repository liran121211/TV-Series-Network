1
00:00:48,589 --> 00:00:52,036
KING THE LAND

2
00:00:52,449 --> 00:00:54,062
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:54,143 --> 00:00:55,882
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:57,017 --> 00:01:00,521
Wild geese live for over 100 years

5
00:01:00,604 --> 00:01:05,192
and never abandon their partner
once they are mated.

6
00:01:05,818 --> 00:01:09,571
They are a symbol of eternal love.

7
00:01:15,828 --> 00:01:18,414
ONE HOUR AGO

8
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,421
What do you think? Don't I look great?

9
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,922
Sure, you do.

10
00:01:28,132 --> 00:01:29,675
But less than the man of the hour.

11
00:01:32,636 --> 00:01:34,138
Let's see.

12
00:01:37,266 --> 00:01:38,308
There it is.

13
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:40,978
Looks great.

14
00:01:41,061 --> 00:01:42,688
- I'll take this.
- This?

15
00:01:42,771 --> 00:01:43,814
Yes, this one.

16
00:01:43,897 --> 00:01:45,190
That obviously looks very humble.

17
00:01:45,274 --> 00:01:46,442
It suits you perfectly.

18
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,986
You have no idea.

19
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:51,947
The Korean people were known
as the white-clad folks.

20
00:01:52,031 --> 00:01:53,699
So for our biggest celebrations,

21
00:01:53,782 --> 00:01:56,952
the most honored person
would put on a white garment

22
00:01:57,036 --> 00:01:58,912
and carry out the most important job.

23
00:01:58,996 --> 00:02:01,206
Of course, that'll be me today.

24
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,709
I'm the most noble and honored man here!

25
00:02:03,792 --> 00:02:04,877
Yes, I know that.

26
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,545
So put that on and do your thing.

27
00:02:06,628 --> 00:02:08,630
I'll put this on and do my thing.

28
00:02:09,298 --> 00:02:10,549
Stop!

29
00:02:10,632 --> 00:02:11,884
Give me those clothes.

30
00:02:13,552 --> 00:02:16,055
I can't put you up
for something as important as this.

31
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:18,307
You can't handle it.

32
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,726
The clothes are mine,
and that job is mine too.

33
00:02:20,809 --> 00:02:22,478
Hand it to me. That's an order!

34
00:02:27,441 --> 00:02:30,152
I'm the most noble and honored.

35
00:02:31,445 --> 00:02:32,446
Sa-rang.

36
00:02:37,242 --> 00:02:41,163
The bride and groom
will share their wedding drinks.

37
00:02:50,089 --> 00:02:54,301
Bride and groom,
hold up your cups respectfully

38
00:02:54,385 --> 00:02:55,844
and have your drinks.

39
00:03:06,355 --> 00:03:07,773
What?

40
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:10,025
Hey!

41
00:03:11,693 --> 00:03:13,028
You're here.

42
00:03:13,112 --> 00:03:14,113
Why are you there?

43
00:03:14,196 --> 00:03:16,281
You wanted to switch. You gave the order.

44
00:03:16,865 --> 00:03:18,033
You said this was important!

45
00:03:18,117 --> 00:03:19,409
How dare you deceive me?

46
00:03:20,119 --> 00:03:21,912
There's nothing more important

47
00:03:21,995 --> 00:03:23,914
than sweeping the yards
to make the place clean

48
00:03:23,997 --> 00:03:25,874
for our guests on this special day.

49
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:28,043
- You!
- What?

50
00:03:28,127 --> 00:03:29,920
- You, come here!
- No, you come.

51
00:03:30,003 --> 00:03:31,171
I'm coming!

52
00:03:31,255 --> 00:03:32,422
- Okay.
- Hey!

53
00:03:32,506 --> 00:03:33,715
Get back here. Stop!

54
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:36,009
What are you going to do?

55
00:03:36,677 --> 00:03:38,095
Sa-rang, you're beautiful.

56
00:03:38,178 --> 00:03:39,388
- You.
- Hey.

57
00:03:39,972 --> 00:03:42,391
- Get back here.
- You can come back later.

58
00:03:42,474 --> 00:03:44,184
How dare you deceive me?

59
00:03:45,853 --> 00:03:47,354
Hey!

60
00:03:47,437 --> 00:03:49,606
You!

61
00:03:54,194 --> 00:03:56,572
EPISODE 8

62
00:04:04,288 --> 00:04:06,373
{\an8}Why did you agree to something
you didn't want to do?

63
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:09,376
{\an8}I'm here on behalf of the hotel.

64
00:04:09,877 --> 00:04:13,922
{\an8}I couldn't allow any damage to it
because of my personal wants.

65
00:04:14,006 --> 00:04:16,008
{\an8}It wasn't easy to get this contract.

66
00:04:19,803 --> 00:04:20,971
{\an8}I still didn't like it.

67
00:04:22,806 --> 00:04:24,975
- What do you mean?
- You and him doing that.

68
00:04:25,517 --> 00:04:26,643
I didn't want to see it.

69
00:04:28,562 --> 00:04:30,564
Wait, are you jealous?

70
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:32,858
Why would I be?

71
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:37,321
Only losers
with zero confidence get jealous.

72
00:04:38,363 --> 00:04:39,406
Which means

73
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,117
that's far from something I would do.

74
00:04:44,161 --> 00:04:45,662
- Then why?
- Just because.

75
00:04:46,788 --> 00:04:48,790
I didn't like seeing you with another man.

76
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,587
That's called jealousy.

77
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:55,714
It wasn't.

78
00:04:56,423 --> 00:04:57,883
Do you know what he's like?

79
00:04:57,966 --> 00:05:00,385
He's probably dated well over 100 women.

80
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:02,054
- He's probably married too.
- Wow.

81
00:05:02,137 --> 00:05:03,514
Two, three… no, four times.

82
00:05:03,597 --> 00:05:05,349
Wow, really?

83
00:05:05,432 --> 00:05:06,975
You can't be with other guys,

84
00:05:07,518 --> 00:05:09,144
but especially not him.

85
00:05:09,228 --> 00:05:11,104
Never. Not at all.

86
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,274
Okay.

87
00:05:14,775 --> 00:05:18,320
Then let's say it wasn't jealousy.

88
00:05:18,403 --> 00:05:21,073
But something like jealousy.

89
00:05:22,157 --> 00:05:23,158
It wasn't.

90
00:05:23,242 --> 00:05:24,743
I wasn't jealous.

91
00:05:24,826 --> 00:05:26,495
Yes, that's what I said.

92
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:33,293
Anyway,

93
00:05:33,377 --> 00:05:35,921
you acted very wisely today.

94
00:05:36,004 --> 00:05:37,965
I was worried
everything was going to fall through.

95
00:05:39,383 --> 00:05:41,343
I'm here on behalf of the hotel.

96
00:05:41,426 --> 00:05:43,887
I may be a jerk who only does as I please,

97
00:05:43,971 --> 00:05:45,264
but work is still work.

98
00:05:47,683 --> 00:05:48,976
Since when?

99
00:05:51,728 --> 00:05:52,938
From now on.

100
00:05:53,522 --> 00:05:54,439
Why?

101
00:05:55,691 --> 00:05:57,150
I want to protect something.

102
00:06:00,028 --> 00:06:02,072
I'll protect it at all costs.

103
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,449
And to do that,

104
00:06:05,409 --> 00:06:06,660
I'll build up my power.

105
00:06:17,337 --> 00:06:18,380
Are you going to work out?

106
00:06:19,673 --> 00:06:22,259
No, I already look great.

107
00:06:22,342 --> 00:06:23,844
- Oh my.
- Why should I?

108
00:06:25,846 --> 00:06:27,639
Where do you find such confidence?

109
00:06:29,057 --> 00:06:30,100
I was

110
00:06:31,059 --> 00:06:32,519
only sharing facts.

111
00:06:34,896 --> 00:06:36,982
I truly apologize for not realizing that.

112
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:58,587
Why are you staring at me like that?

113
00:07:01,006 --> 00:07:02,090
Because I love it.

114
00:07:03,216 --> 00:07:04,051
What?

115
00:07:04,926 --> 00:07:06,011
Love.

116
00:07:15,187 --> 00:07:16,521
I'm saying I love everything.

117
00:07:17,064 --> 00:07:19,149
Well, the weather

118
00:07:20,025 --> 00:07:21,318
and the wind.

119
00:07:24,821 --> 00:07:26,114
The weather.

120
00:07:27,032 --> 00:07:28,950
Yes, the weather is wonderful today.

121
00:07:31,244 --> 00:07:32,996
What great weather.

122
00:07:41,588 --> 00:07:42,923
Hey!

123
00:07:49,137 --> 00:07:51,264
How dare you ruin my sacred wedding?

124
00:07:51,348 --> 00:07:52,849
You made a fool out of my love!

125
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:53,767
Love?

126
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,143
Love, my foot.

127
00:07:55,227 --> 00:07:57,771
You said you've dated
over 100 women until now.

128
00:07:57,854 --> 00:07:59,731
And you were married twice.
Or was it thrice?

129
00:07:59,815 --> 00:08:01,358
It's not a crime to be popular.

130
00:08:01,441 --> 00:08:03,193
Though someone as unpopular as you

131
00:08:03,276 --> 00:08:05,070
would never know.

132
00:08:06,154 --> 00:08:07,406
I'm popular enough.

133
00:08:07,489 --> 00:08:09,408
I just chose not to date people.

134
00:08:09,491 --> 00:08:13,161
A woman-chaser like you
can't even comprehend how popular I am.

135
00:08:13,245 --> 00:08:16,540
You're quite proud for a penniless pauper.

136
00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:19,459
- How much do you have?
- A whole lot.

137
00:08:19,543 --> 00:08:20,585
Excuse me.

138
00:08:21,086 --> 00:08:23,463
If you two are going to fight,
I'm going home.

139
00:08:26,258 --> 00:08:27,801
We aren't fighting, Sa-rang.

140
00:08:28,301 --> 00:08:30,429
We aren't. We're just warning each other.

141
00:08:31,763 --> 00:08:33,724
I'm warning you.

142
00:08:33,807 --> 00:08:36,560
You're banned from being
within a 100 m radius of Ms. Cheon.

143
00:08:36,643 --> 00:08:38,270
Got it? Go.

144
00:08:38,353 --> 00:08:40,856
Did you forget about the contract?
I'm the one who gives orders.

145
00:08:40,939 --> 00:08:42,232
{\an8}Get rid of him!

146
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,360
What? Get rid of me?

147
00:08:45,444 --> 00:08:46,987
- Yes, you.
- You think that's possible?

148
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,029
You… Oh.

149
00:08:48,113 --> 00:08:49,531
- Get rid of me?
- Yes.

150
00:08:49,614 --> 00:08:50,574
Go quickly.

151
00:08:50,657 --> 00:08:51,950
You can't get rid of me!

152
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:53,827
Let go! Wait, you're really doing this.

153
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:56,496
Man, I'm walking on air.

154
00:08:58,373 --> 00:08:59,207
Finally.

155
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,251
It's the two of us.

156
00:09:01,793 --> 00:09:02,627
Yes.

157
00:09:02,711 --> 00:09:04,379
Let's take a walk, Sa-rang.

158
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,256
All right.

159
00:09:19,102 --> 00:09:21,271
Isn't it tough
to wait on guests for a living?

160
00:09:23,064 --> 00:09:24,357
Of course it's tough.

161
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:28,528
It's not always easy
to serve every guest with a smile.

162
00:09:28,612 --> 00:09:29,738
I'll give you a hotel.

163
00:09:30,447 --> 00:09:31,323
Pardon?

164
00:09:31,406 --> 00:09:32,532
I have lots.

165
00:09:32,616 --> 00:09:34,367
You can choose whichever one you like.

166
00:09:34,451 --> 00:09:36,495
Then you won't have to live
such a tough life.

167
00:09:37,454 --> 00:09:39,122
It's all right, really.

168
00:09:40,123 --> 00:09:42,918
It may be tough, but I still love my job.

169
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,378
It'll be even better if you own a hotel.

170
00:09:46,838 --> 00:09:49,382
What I want to do
isn't business management.

171
00:09:49,883 --> 00:09:53,720
I want to provide a happy day
for every guest we have.

172
00:09:55,013 --> 00:09:58,558
It's a special thing
to present happiness to someone.

173
00:09:59,142 --> 00:10:01,353
And it's not something just anyone can do.

174
00:10:12,447 --> 00:10:13,824
You're such a wonderful woman.

175
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,076
I knew it.

176
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:17,661
I have a good eye for people.

177
00:10:18,537 --> 00:10:20,121
I must have a party!

178
00:10:20,205 --> 00:10:21,832
Party time!

179
00:10:23,542 --> 00:10:24,584
Sure.

180
00:10:33,844 --> 00:10:34,845
Go inside.

181
00:10:34,928 --> 00:10:37,305
I had a wonderful day thanks to you.

182
00:10:38,014 --> 00:10:39,766
Sa-rang, see you tomorrow.

183
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,601
Yes, Your Highness.

184
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:50,068
Don't you think that smile was too big?

185
00:10:53,446 --> 00:10:54,656
It's finally over.

186
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,784
Great work today, Mr. Gu.

187
00:10:57,868 --> 00:10:58,827
Great work.

188
00:11:09,087 --> 00:11:09,921
Put these on.

189
00:11:11,548 --> 00:11:12,465
I'm all right.

190
00:11:12,549 --> 00:11:14,759
You dragged those around all day
without a break.

191
00:11:15,343 --> 00:11:16,928
Don't you feel bad for your feet?

192
00:11:17,012 --> 00:11:18,805
Show some kindness and let them rest.

193
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:35,739
You're acting like
you did something wrong.

194
00:11:35,822 --> 00:11:37,407
What if someone sees me?

195
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:39,200
No one will, so calm down.

196
00:11:43,747 --> 00:11:44,789
What are you doing?

197
00:11:46,249 --> 00:11:47,500
You can sleep here tonight.

198
00:11:53,465 --> 00:11:54,758
Sleep here?

199
00:12:17,572 --> 00:12:20,158
Great work escorting that headache

200
00:12:20,241 --> 00:12:22,202
and working overtime
on behalf of our hotel.

201
00:12:22,702 --> 00:12:26,247
He may be our VIP guest,
but you're our VVIP employee.

202
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,167
You deserve to stay here tonight.

203
00:12:31,169 --> 00:12:32,629
Don't turn it down.

204
00:12:35,006 --> 00:12:37,300
I won't. Thank you.

205
00:12:48,103 --> 00:12:50,230
You must be hungry.
Order some room service.

206
00:12:50,313 --> 00:12:51,940
Eat whatever you want

207
00:12:52,565 --> 00:12:53,525
and rest up.

208
00:12:55,318 --> 00:12:56,611
This is an employee benefit.

209
00:12:58,071 --> 00:12:59,072
Okay.

210
00:13:01,157 --> 00:13:02,242
Good night.

211
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,845
Mr. Gu.

212
00:13:47,588 --> 00:13:49,423
I told you to order room service,

213
00:13:49,507 --> 00:13:50,967
but you choose instant noodles?

214
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,760
The best late-night snack
is instant noodles.

215
00:13:52,844 --> 00:13:53,886
You don't know, do you?

216
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,930
What do you take me for?

217
00:13:56,013 --> 00:13:57,056
Of course I do.

218
00:13:58,391 --> 00:14:00,560
- Really?
- Yes, really.

219
00:14:02,603 --> 00:14:03,563
In that case,

220
00:14:04,605 --> 00:14:05,439
I choose this.

221
00:14:10,945 --> 00:14:13,531
To think we came all the way
to the Han River for raw instant noodles.

222
00:14:15,491 --> 00:14:17,618
You really don't know a thing.

223
00:14:18,202 --> 00:14:21,414
If you're at the Han River,
you've got to have this one.

224
00:14:21,497 --> 00:14:23,708
Read this. "The original cup noodles."

225
00:14:47,148 --> 00:14:48,191
Is it that good?

226
00:14:48,274 --> 00:14:49,400
I think

227
00:14:50,359 --> 00:14:51,444
I simply must

228
00:14:52,612 --> 00:14:54,530
get that machine in my room.

229
00:14:54,614 --> 00:14:55,448
Come on.

230
00:14:55,531 --> 00:14:57,742
Then it wouldn't taste like this.

231
00:14:57,825 --> 00:14:59,118
It only tastes this good

232
00:14:59,202 --> 00:15:01,787
when you throw in this soft river breeze

233
00:15:01,871 --> 00:15:04,916
and that dazzling night view.

234
00:15:04,999 --> 00:15:06,334
That's key.

235
00:15:06,834 --> 00:15:09,670
At times, I come here
for instant noodles and beer after work.

236
00:15:09,754 --> 00:15:11,005
It tastes like heaven.

237
00:15:12,298 --> 00:15:13,341
Hey.

238
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,385
You kept this awesome attraction
all to yourself?

239
00:15:16,469 --> 00:15:19,013
You're more selfish than I thought.

240
00:15:20,765 --> 00:15:23,976
Do you have to criticize me that much
over some instant noodles?

241
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,394
"Some instant noodles"?

242
00:15:25,478 --> 00:15:27,939
These are the best instant noodles
I've ever had.

243
00:15:29,315 --> 00:15:30,441
They're so good.

244
00:15:30,524 --> 00:15:31,776
I'm glad.

245
00:15:33,194 --> 00:15:34,153
In that case…

246
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:36,906
I rarely share this secret with others.

247
00:15:38,574 --> 00:15:39,867
The time is now.

248
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:42,620
One dumpling.

249
00:15:51,045 --> 00:15:52,505
- On top.
- Yes.

250
00:16:01,389 --> 00:16:02,390
Isn't it good?

251
00:16:03,224 --> 00:16:04,725
This place makes great dumplings.

252
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:09,730
I never got to enjoy such treats in life.

253
00:16:10,314 --> 00:16:11,732
I lived in vain.

254
00:16:12,817 --> 00:16:13,818
Anyway.

255
00:16:14,694 --> 00:16:16,445
Is there a good timing for beer too?

256
00:16:17,488 --> 00:16:19,448
- Of course there is.
- When is it?

257
00:16:31,585 --> 00:16:33,879
- Now!
- Now?

258
00:16:33,963 --> 00:16:35,965
- Now?
- Now! Hurry.

259
00:16:45,683 --> 00:16:47,226
- Now.
- I was right, wasn't I?

260
00:16:48,311 --> 00:16:49,478
Nice timing.

261
00:16:53,441 --> 00:16:54,859
- You're home.
- Dad!

262
00:16:56,402 --> 00:16:57,445
What's going on?

263
00:16:57,528 --> 00:17:00,072
- Did you come early to play with me?
- I'm…

264
00:17:01,449 --> 00:17:02,700
too tired to play.

265
00:17:02,783 --> 00:17:04,869
- Go play with Mom.
- I knew it.

266
00:17:04,952 --> 00:17:06,579
You would never play with me.

267
00:17:06,662 --> 00:17:09,665
Cho-rong, why don't you show him
the new dance you learned today?

268
00:17:10,624 --> 00:17:12,209
I'm the best dancer in my class.

269
00:17:12,293 --> 00:17:14,045
Later. I'm tired.

270
00:17:17,173 --> 00:17:18,424
Where's dinner? I'm hungry.

271
00:17:20,259 --> 00:17:21,802
Should the three of us eat out?

272
00:17:21,886 --> 00:17:23,679
Or should we order something?

273
00:17:23,763 --> 00:17:25,431
I want short ribs or fried chicken.

274
00:17:25,514 --> 00:17:28,142
- Should we?
- I'm sick of eating out.

275
00:17:28,225 --> 00:17:29,727
Let's just eat whatever we have.

276
00:17:41,489 --> 00:17:43,699
Honey, can you take out the trash?

277
00:17:44,492 --> 00:17:45,659
Honey?

278
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,483
- Dad.
- Yes?

279
00:18:17,566 --> 00:18:19,110
Where's your shame?

280
00:18:19,193 --> 00:18:21,404
If Mom cooked for you,

281
00:18:21,487 --> 00:18:24,198
shouldn't you at least take the trash out?

282
00:18:24,281 --> 00:18:25,658
But I ate her food enthusiastically.

283
00:18:25,741 --> 00:18:27,118
Do you know how hard that is?

284
00:18:28,327 --> 00:18:29,662
It must be one tough job.

285
00:18:30,621 --> 00:18:31,664
When I grow up,

286
00:18:31,747 --> 00:18:33,833
I'll never marry a lazy bum like you.

287
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:34,750
What?

288
00:18:35,292 --> 00:18:36,836
You used to say I was the coolest.

289
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:40,339
I didn't know any better
because I was too young.

290
00:18:40,423 --> 00:18:41,424
What?

291
00:18:43,092 --> 00:18:45,094
That was ages ago.

292
00:18:47,596 --> 00:18:50,015
You're all grown up. All grown.

293
00:19:25,509 --> 00:19:27,344
<i>First floor. Going down.</i>

294
00:19:29,013 --> 00:19:30,055
<i>Doors closing.</i>

295
00:20:06,842 --> 00:20:07,718
Did you sleep well?

296
00:20:08,427 --> 00:20:09,678
Yes, thanks to you.

297
00:20:09,762 --> 00:20:11,847
How do you want your breakfast?

298
00:20:12,473 --> 00:20:13,766
What time is it?

299
00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:16,143
Eight o'clock.

300
00:20:17,686 --> 00:20:20,898
My shift begins at 3:00 p.m. today,
so may I sleep a little more?

301
00:20:20,981 --> 00:20:21,899
I'm sorry.

302
00:20:22,525 --> 00:20:24,401
I thought your shift began earlier.

303
00:20:24,485 --> 00:20:25,528
All right. Go to sleep.

304
00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:28,864
Okay. Thank you.

305
00:20:55,808 --> 00:20:56,892
Yes?

306
00:20:56,976 --> 00:20:58,602
I pushed your checkout time to 3 p.m.

307
00:20:59,812 --> 00:21:01,897
- Thank you.
- Okay. See you later.

308
00:21:01,981 --> 00:21:03,649
- Sleep tight.
- Okay.

309
00:21:08,737 --> 00:21:09,905
What are you doing?

310
00:21:10,614 --> 00:21:11,740
What are you doing?

311
00:21:25,462 --> 00:21:26,463
Oh no.

312
00:21:26,547 --> 00:21:27,464
What do we do?

313
00:21:29,717 --> 00:21:31,135
- Hide.
- What?

314
00:21:31,218 --> 00:21:32,303
Hide.

315
00:21:41,687 --> 00:21:42,813
What do you want?

316
00:21:42,896 --> 00:21:44,523
I heard you checked in yesterday,

317
00:21:44,607 --> 00:21:47,693
so I came by to see
if you found anything uncomfortable.

318
00:21:47,776 --> 00:21:49,820
This unannounced visit is uncomfortable.

319
00:21:49,903 --> 00:21:50,779
I'm sorry.

320
00:21:50,863 --> 00:21:53,324
I wanted to take extra good care of you.

321
00:21:53,407 --> 00:21:55,034
My checkout's at 3 p.m.

322
00:21:55,117 --> 00:21:58,579
I asked to make sure I'm undisturbed
because I wanted to get a good rest.

323
00:21:58,662 --> 00:21:59,913
Did you miss the memo?

324
00:22:01,332 --> 00:22:02,416
I'm sorry.

325
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:06,420
But if you need anything
or find anything uncomfortable--

326
00:22:06,503 --> 00:22:08,088
I don't need anything. Goodbye.

327
00:22:13,594 --> 00:22:14,762
He's so cool.

328
00:22:15,554 --> 00:22:17,431
That curt manner is his charm.

329
00:22:20,768 --> 00:22:22,811
Hello, you've reached Manager Kim Su-mi.

330
00:22:25,481 --> 00:22:27,441
His Highness is looking for me?

331
00:22:28,192 --> 00:22:29,568
Yes, okay.

332
00:22:29,652 --> 00:22:31,362
Oh my! What's happening?

333
00:22:37,493 --> 00:22:38,452
Where are you?

334
00:22:39,495 --> 00:22:40,871
You can come out now.

335
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:45,084
Is she gone?

336
00:22:46,543 --> 00:22:48,379
It's not like you did anything wrong.

337
00:22:49,463 --> 00:22:51,256
I didn't want to give the wrong idea.

338
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:54,134
Your behavior right now
will give people the wrong idea.

339
00:22:54,218 --> 00:22:56,011
I said this was your employee benefit.

340
00:22:56,095 --> 00:22:57,471
You just made me look odd too.

341
00:22:57,554 --> 00:22:59,014
I'm completely awake now.

342
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,350
- I must go.
- You don't have to.

343
00:23:01,892 --> 00:23:03,936
I told them not to disturb me.

344
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,063
No, I'm fine, really.

345
00:23:06,146 --> 00:23:08,273
I had a good rest thanks to your kindness.

346
00:23:08,774 --> 00:23:10,275
- Thank you.
- Sure.

347
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:11,735
I forgot.

348
00:23:11,819 --> 00:23:13,695
You're not the type that just listens.

349
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,146
Nobody will come,
so don't mind them and sleep some more.

350
00:23:47,896 --> 00:23:48,981
Okay?

351
00:24:33,233 --> 00:24:35,444
- Good afternoon.
- Not for me.

352
00:24:35,527 --> 00:24:37,905
This isn't even the first time.
Are you teasing me?

353
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,700
Were you my mortal enemy
in a previous life?

354
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:45,954
Why do I have to run such petty errands?

355
00:24:46,038 --> 00:24:47,289
Why?

356
00:24:48,707 --> 00:24:49,666
What's this?

357
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:54,546
Your Highness, this is a dress that meets
the dress code for tonight's party.

358
00:24:55,172 --> 00:24:57,883
Make sure you attend the party in this.

359
00:24:57,966 --> 00:24:58,967
Says who?

360
00:24:59,051 --> 00:25:00,677
The prince!

361
00:25:00,761 --> 00:25:02,054
Your prince!

362
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,235
This is from His Highness.

363
00:25:16,318 --> 00:25:18,654
It's the outfit for tonight's party.
You must wear it.

364
00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:21,990
He can be annoying in so many ways.

365
00:25:22,074 --> 00:25:24,284
But he sent you a present as a friend.

366
00:25:24,368 --> 00:25:25,410
You must be happy.

367
00:25:25,994 --> 00:25:27,371
He's not a friend.

368
00:25:27,454 --> 00:25:28,830
Stop it. I know you're glad.

369
00:25:28,914 --> 00:25:31,333
Then allow me to open it.

370
00:25:32,042 --> 00:25:33,252
See that?

371
00:25:37,589 --> 00:25:38,674
Good grief.

372
00:25:39,633 --> 00:25:40,759
He didn't have to…

373
00:25:45,847 --> 00:25:46,807
That little…

374
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:49,142
What the fuck!

375
00:26:28,432 --> 00:26:29,474
Sa-rang.

376
00:26:33,145 --> 00:26:35,439
I knew I had a good eye.

377
00:26:35,522 --> 00:26:36,982
I knew it'd look good on you.

378
00:26:38,442 --> 00:26:40,485
It's awkward to be in something like this.

379
00:26:41,236 --> 00:26:42,696
I wanted you to see

380
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:45,282
the kind of outfit that suits you best.

381
00:26:45,365 --> 00:26:48,577
I knew you'd look great
in an elegant garment like this.

382
00:26:49,328 --> 00:26:50,495
I see.

383
00:27:01,214 --> 00:27:02,257
Thank you.

384
00:27:06,845 --> 00:27:08,263
Let us begin the party.

385
00:27:34,122 --> 00:27:35,791
What are you doing?

386
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:38,293
And your outfit?

387
00:27:39,252 --> 00:27:40,253
I'm volunteering.

388
00:27:40,337 --> 00:27:42,589
All my butlers are dressed like that.

389
00:27:42,673 --> 00:27:43,924
Relax and sit, Sa-rang.

390
00:27:45,509 --> 00:27:46,551
Well,

391
00:27:47,094 --> 00:27:50,013
how can I relax and sit
when I feel uncomfortable?

392
00:27:50,097 --> 00:27:51,264
It's all right, ma'am.

393
00:27:51,348 --> 00:27:52,891
Please relax and take a seat.

394
00:27:59,106 --> 00:28:00,899
Allow me to serve the wine.

395
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:10,075
Shouldn't you tell us about it?

396
00:28:13,161 --> 00:28:15,664
I prepared this extremely overpriced wine

397
00:28:15,747 --> 00:28:18,792
befitting of your position, Your Highness.

398
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:20,001
Drink up

399
00:28:20,085 --> 00:28:22,921
and help boost our sales numbers.

400
00:28:23,964 --> 00:28:25,924
Does this hotel serve wine with that face?

401
00:28:37,144 --> 00:28:38,854
What? Are you telling me
to drink this and die?

402
00:28:39,438 --> 00:28:41,189
Take it however you like.

403
00:28:41,273 --> 00:28:44,317
You can either drink it and die,
or die and drink it.

404
00:28:44,401 --> 00:28:46,111
Let me prepare your food.

405
00:28:50,824 --> 00:28:52,909
What's going on? Why is he serving us?

406
00:28:52,993 --> 00:28:54,953
I put him up to it. For us.

407
00:28:56,204 --> 00:28:57,247
But why?

408
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:59,750
You deserve only the best service.

409
00:28:59,833 --> 00:29:02,836
Someone like the hotel's head manager
seemed to qualify,

410
00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:03,920
so I got him.

411
00:29:06,256 --> 00:29:07,424
Thank you very much,

412
00:29:07,966 --> 00:29:10,218
but I'm still a staff member
of this hotel.

413
00:29:10,302 --> 00:29:11,762
Look at yourself right now.

414
00:29:11,845 --> 00:29:12,679
What suits you

415
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:15,348
isn't a uniform, but a dress.

416
00:29:15,432 --> 00:29:17,059
Not a hotel, but my royal family.

417
00:29:17,142 --> 00:29:18,310
Marry me.

418
00:29:19,853 --> 00:29:20,687
Sorry?

419
00:29:20,771 --> 00:29:22,981
This is an official proposal.

420
00:29:23,065 --> 00:29:24,566
Will you marry me?

421
00:29:25,442 --> 00:29:27,277
Wait, what are you…

422
00:29:29,821 --> 00:29:30,906
Sa-rang,

423
00:29:31,865 --> 00:29:33,200
my love.

424
00:29:55,055 --> 00:29:56,223
No!

425
00:29:56,306 --> 00:29:57,724
- Never.
- What are you doing?

426
00:29:57,808 --> 00:29:58,683
Flat out no.

427
00:29:58,767 --> 00:30:00,894
I object to this proposal.

428
00:30:00,977 --> 00:30:02,395
Who do you think you are?

429
00:30:02,479 --> 00:30:04,481
Me? I have the right to say this.

430
00:30:04,564 --> 00:30:06,942
Because I'm…

431
00:30:07,442 --> 00:30:09,402
Ms. Cheon is one of my employees,

432
00:30:09,486 --> 00:30:12,364
and I'm her employer
who has a responsibility to protect her.

433
00:30:12,447 --> 00:30:13,949
Not only that, you're a player,

434
00:30:14,032 --> 00:30:15,617
and I can buy this too!

435
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,701
Anyway, no.

436
00:30:16,785 --> 00:30:19,246
I won't play along with this joke anymore.
I'm off.

437
00:30:19,329 --> 00:30:20,163
Let's go.

438
00:30:20,789 --> 00:30:21,790
Give me the ring.

439
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:28,255
What?

440
00:30:28,964 --> 00:30:30,215
You're accepting this?

441
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,342
It's a present for me.

442
00:30:32,425 --> 00:30:33,301
Give it to me.

443
00:31:01,997 --> 00:31:03,957
I've never seen such a pretty ring before.

444
00:31:07,669 --> 00:31:10,130
Thank you for regarding me favorably.

445
00:31:10,797 --> 00:31:13,800
I'll keep your kindness in my heart
and cherish it for a long time.

446
00:31:16,094 --> 00:31:18,471
Wait, are you turning me down?

447
00:31:18,555 --> 00:31:20,432
I'll just accept the thought.

448
00:31:21,391 --> 00:31:25,645
It was a huge honor to serve
a gentleman like you, Your Highness.

449
00:31:26,354 --> 00:31:30,525
I'll remember you for a very long time
as the most fabulous guest I've ever met.

450
00:31:30,609 --> 00:31:32,944
Please visit us again
as our best guest in history.

451
00:31:33,028 --> 00:31:35,947
We'll always serve you
joyfully and wholeheartedly.

452
00:31:39,409 --> 00:31:42,120
This was the first time
I wasn't hurt after a rejection.

453
00:31:42,829 --> 00:31:44,539
I was wrong.

454
00:31:44,623 --> 00:31:46,041
You're unlike what I thought.

455
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:49,085
You're much more special and fabulous.

456
00:31:49,669 --> 00:31:52,631
Your Highness, you're the one
who's special and fabulous.

457
00:31:52,714 --> 00:31:53,548
Okay.

458
00:31:53,632 --> 00:31:55,467
I'll back off this time.

459
00:31:56,259 --> 00:31:59,846
Next time, I'll come back with a ring
that's much prettier and more expensive.

460
00:32:00,764 --> 00:32:02,057
Don't turn me down then.

461
00:32:08,855 --> 00:32:10,482
May we eat? I'm hungry.

462
00:32:10,565 --> 00:32:11,691
With Mr. Gu, of course.

463
00:32:12,651 --> 00:32:14,069
No, he's here as a server.

464
00:32:14,152 --> 00:32:15,570
I don't want to dine with him.

465
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,448
But it's your last day.

466
00:32:18,531 --> 00:32:20,075
Let's all enjoy supper.

467
00:32:22,202 --> 00:32:24,704
Well, if that's what you want.

468
00:32:25,872 --> 00:32:28,416
- Take a seat.
- Forget it. I don't want to eat.

469
00:32:34,172 --> 00:32:35,215
Mr. Gu.

470
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:40,095
Mr. Gu.

471
00:32:43,848 --> 00:32:44,808
Hermès.

472
00:32:51,398 --> 00:32:52,649
If you want it that badly,

473
00:32:54,192 --> 00:32:55,318
then I'll join.

474
00:33:02,826 --> 00:33:03,827
Sit down.

475
00:33:07,455 --> 00:33:08,957
Serve before you sit.

476
00:33:13,586 --> 00:33:15,005
Thank you.

477
00:33:15,588 --> 00:33:17,299
- Do it for me too.
- You've got hands.

478
00:33:22,304 --> 00:33:23,972
You're really annoying.

479
00:33:24,055 --> 00:33:25,265
He has many girlfriends.

480
00:33:30,312 --> 00:33:31,146
Cheers.

481
00:33:34,941 --> 00:33:36,943
This is a present from me.

482
00:33:37,027 --> 00:33:38,820
Why isn't it just us two?

483
00:33:39,404 --> 00:33:40,613
I'll be back soon.

484
00:33:40,697 --> 00:33:43,116
Don't start dating someone else
before I return,

485
00:33:43,199 --> 00:33:44,451
Sa-rang.

486
00:33:44,534 --> 00:33:45,910
You're always welcome here.

487
00:33:45,994 --> 00:33:47,203
Sa-rang.

488
00:33:48,747 --> 00:33:50,790
Hey, you should go. You're running late.

489
00:33:51,499 --> 00:33:53,043
I had fun thanks to you.

490
00:33:53,126 --> 00:33:54,878
This is your tip.

491
00:33:55,795 --> 00:33:57,339
You're pretty stingy for a prince.

492
00:33:57,839 --> 00:33:58,923
What is this?

493
00:33:59,007 --> 00:34:00,508
Give me a blank check.

494
00:34:01,217 --> 00:34:02,969
This is generous
considering your performance.

495
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,597
Be prepared as a guide next time.

496
00:34:07,015 --> 00:34:08,516
Good grief.

497
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,061
Don't ever return.
I'm shutting the hotel down.

498
00:34:11,144 --> 00:34:13,480
I'll return before then.
Don't miss me too much.

499
00:34:17,609 --> 00:34:19,486
See you again, my friend.

500
00:34:20,987 --> 00:34:22,072
What are you doing?

501
00:34:22,155 --> 00:34:25,075
Come on. I don't need friends.

502
00:34:25,158 --> 00:34:26,659
Me neither.

503
00:34:26,743 --> 00:34:28,912
That makes you and I the same.

504
00:34:29,496 --> 00:34:30,372
I'll be back.

505
00:34:30,455 --> 00:34:31,790
My brother, Won.

506
00:34:36,294 --> 00:34:37,337
Don't come back.

507
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:05,615
You two really are friends,

508
00:35:05,698 --> 00:35:07,200
having fun until the last moment.

509
00:35:07,283 --> 00:35:08,660
Friends? Hardly.

510
00:35:08,743 --> 00:35:10,370
I hate guys like him.

511
00:35:13,373 --> 00:35:14,833
May I ask you something?

512
00:35:17,168 --> 00:35:18,253
Why did you do that?

513
00:35:19,754 --> 00:35:22,340
You would never accept
an order to serve food.

514
00:35:22,924 --> 00:35:24,592
And you dressed like a butler too.

515
00:35:26,261 --> 00:35:27,554
Because I promised to show

516
00:35:28,263 --> 00:35:29,305
a great performance

517
00:35:29,389 --> 00:35:32,559
as a representative of this hotel
until the very last moment.

518
00:35:36,688 --> 00:35:38,022
So? Did I do okay?

519
00:35:39,357 --> 00:35:41,985
I hope I was worth training.

520
00:35:42,068 --> 00:35:42,902
Yes.

521
00:35:44,028 --> 00:35:46,114
You did a splendid job.

522
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:50,160
Anyway.

523
00:35:52,495 --> 00:35:53,913
Why did you take a while

524
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:56,416
to answer him yesterday?

525
00:35:58,251 --> 00:36:00,044
He proposed with sincerity,

526
00:36:00,712 --> 00:36:03,131
so it wasn't good manners
to turn him down easily.

527
00:36:04,215 --> 00:36:06,384
You shouldn't allow such punks leeway.

528
00:36:06,468 --> 00:36:08,386
There's no need
to show him manners either.

529
00:36:10,346 --> 00:36:11,473
Wait.

530
00:36:12,557 --> 00:36:13,892
Did you consider

531
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:18,062
accepting his proposal even for a moment?

532
00:36:26,905 --> 00:36:28,198
It's a secret.

533
00:36:29,491 --> 00:36:31,159
There are no secrets between us.

534
00:36:31,242 --> 00:36:33,036
Of course there are secrets between us.

535
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:34,996
You're about to make me really sad.

536
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:36,122
Will you be like this?

537
00:36:36,873 --> 00:36:38,124
You really won't tell me?

538
00:36:38,208 --> 00:36:39,459
It's a secret.

539
00:36:40,543 --> 00:36:41,544
I mean…

540
00:36:41,628 --> 00:36:42,837
It's a secret.

541
00:36:42,921 --> 00:36:43,922
Please excuse me.

542
00:36:44,005 --> 00:36:45,590
Where are you going? I'm not done.

543
00:36:45,673 --> 00:36:48,134
It's the busiest time of the day,
so I should go.

544
00:36:48,218 --> 00:36:49,469
Please excuse me.

545
00:36:50,178 --> 00:36:51,804
- It's a secret.
- What?

546
00:36:54,766 --> 00:36:56,351
Where's the Grand Ballroom?

547
00:36:56,434 --> 00:36:58,061
Please come this way.

548
00:37:09,364 --> 00:37:10,448
A secret?

549
00:37:16,996 --> 00:37:19,332
We're landing soon.
It's dangerous, so I'll wrap up.

550
00:37:19,415 --> 00:37:21,876
No, I got it.
You can get ready for landing.

551
00:37:30,802 --> 00:37:31,844
Here you go.

552
00:37:31,928 --> 00:37:32,971
Thank you.

553
00:37:38,142 --> 00:37:39,602
<i>Dear passengers,</i>

554
00:37:39,686 --> 00:37:43,606
<i>we are now arriving
at Incheon International Airport.</i>

555
00:37:44,232 --> 00:37:45,733
<i>Please remain seated</i>

556
00:37:45,817 --> 00:37:48,278
<i>until the aircraft makes a full stop</i>

557
00:37:48,361 --> 00:37:50,113
<i>and the seatbelt sign turns off.</i>

558
00:37:50,989 --> 00:37:54,117
<i>Thank you for flying with King Air.</i>

559
00:37:54,826 --> 00:37:56,411
<i>Our flight crew</i>

560
00:37:56,494 --> 00:38:00,290
<i>will always serve you
in safety and comfort.</i>

561
00:38:08,506 --> 00:38:09,382
My gosh!

562
00:38:10,633 --> 00:38:12,427
Pyeong-hwa, what's going on?

563
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:14,596
I know we've never met, but may I come in?

564
00:38:15,513 --> 00:38:16,973
Sure, come on in.

565
00:38:22,353 --> 00:38:23,438
One second.

566
00:38:28,526 --> 00:38:29,736
What happened?

567
00:38:29,819 --> 00:38:32,280
I think she sprained her back.

568
00:38:32,864 --> 00:38:34,490
Could you put ice on her?

569
00:38:35,283 --> 00:38:37,327
After about 15 minutes,

570
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:39,203
you can put a pain relief patch on her.

571
00:38:40,204 --> 00:38:41,080
Okay.

572
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:43,666
Don't worry. I'll take care of her.

573
00:38:44,292 --> 00:38:45,543
Yes, thank you.

574
00:38:46,127 --> 00:38:48,338
I'll introduce myself properly next time.

575
00:38:49,005 --> 00:38:49,964
Okay.

576
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:51,799
I'll come by tomorrow.

577
00:38:52,508 --> 00:38:53,885
Don't do anything today

578
00:38:53,968 --> 00:38:56,220
and go right to bed, okay?

579
00:38:56,304 --> 00:38:57,889
Okay. Thank you.

580
00:38:59,307 --> 00:39:00,350
Good night.

581
00:39:01,643 --> 00:39:02,727
Goodbye.

582
00:39:05,188 --> 00:39:06,230
Bye.

583
00:39:08,107 --> 00:39:09,567
Take care.

584
00:39:16,074 --> 00:39:17,575
He's so attractive!

585
00:39:17,659 --> 00:39:20,411
- Who's that? The guy from that time?
- My back!

586
00:39:20,495 --> 00:39:22,622
My back.

587
00:39:25,208 --> 00:39:26,876
I'll put a pain relief patch on you.

588
00:39:33,174 --> 00:39:35,093
Goodness, you're such a fool.

589
00:39:35,176 --> 00:39:37,178
It could've been much worse.

590
00:39:37,261 --> 00:39:39,180
A promotion isn't worth getting hurt over.

591
00:39:39,263 --> 00:39:41,391
It's not that I'm dying to get promoted.

592
00:39:42,016 --> 00:39:43,935
It's my desperate struggle to survive.

593
00:39:44,018 --> 00:39:47,522
If you struggle a few more times,
you'll go broke buying these patches.

594
00:39:49,107 --> 00:39:50,858
Do you want to be a purser that badly?

595
00:39:51,818 --> 00:39:53,528
It's not that I want to.

596
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:55,571
I really have to be one now.

597
00:39:57,615 --> 00:39:59,659
But I don't think
it'll happen in this life.

598
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:03,705
What if this is your last life?
Don't just give up.

599
00:40:03,788 --> 00:40:06,791
You even hurt your back working hard,
so keep it up until the end.

600
00:40:06,874 --> 00:40:08,876
No matter how hard I try,

601
00:40:10,211 --> 00:40:12,505
I can't even do half as much as others.

602
00:40:12,588 --> 00:40:14,215
What do the others do?

603
00:40:14,716 --> 00:40:16,592
Nobody works as hard as you.

604
00:40:21,806 --> 00:40:25,309
A FEW HOURS AGO

605
00:40:28,688 --> 00:40:30,565
I thought you wanted to become L1.

606
00:40:30,648 --> 00:40:32,024
I guess you aren't desperate.

607
00:40:33,443 --> 00:40:35,069
I'll work harder.

608
00:40:35,153 --> 00:40:36,988
That's your problem.

609
00:40:37,572 --> 00:40:38,990
Everyone works hard.

610
00:40:39,782 --> 00:40:41,951
It's because you only take
standard procedures.

611
00:40:43,161 --> 00:40:44,746
Other teams

612
00:40:44,829 --> 00:40:46,873
carry the duty-free books around,

613
00:40:46,956 --> 00:40:49,542
selling and even delivering
the items themselves.

614
00:40:51,252 --> 00:40:53,379
They'll get in trouble if they're caught.

615
00:40:53,463 --> 00:40:55,089
The company will go berserk.

616
00:40:55,173 --> 00:40:56,883
Do you really think they don't know?

617
00:40:57,925 --> 00:40:58,885
Pyeong-hwa.

618
00:40:58,968 --> 00:41:01,053
There's no free lunch in this world.

619
00:41:01,137 --> 00:41:04,891
Only those who are passionate enough
to put up with such danger

620
00:41:04,974 --> 00:41:06,142
get promoted.

621
00:41:07,852 --> 00:41:08,936
Don't be scared.

622
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,980
I'm just sharing an example.

623
00:41:12,023 --> 00:41:14,358
To triumph in this fierce competition,

624
00:41:14,442 --> 00:41:18,821
you need to show enough passion
to match what the others are doing.

625
00:41:23,075 --> 00:41:24,076
Sa-rang.

626
00:41:25,077 --> 00:41:25,995
Yes?

627
00:41:26,621 --> 00:41:29,749
Are you free tomorrow evening?

628
00:41:31,542 --> 00:41:33,544
SAMSAM SPA, HOT KILN SAUNA

629
00:41:40,968 --> 00:41:44,597
Why do I get freckles only on my face,
not my feet?

630
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:47,809
They're never in the sun.

631
00:41:47,892 --> 00:41:50,019
There's skin on the feet too.

632
00:41:50,102 --> 00:41:52,230
But why would your soles get freckles?

633
00:41:52,313 --> 00:41:53,940
They'd need to see the sun.

634
00:41:54,023 --> 00:41:55,900
It's a shame we get freckles on our face.

635
00:41:56,943 --> 00:41:57,860
Oh my.

636
00:41:57,944 --> 00:41:59,737
You can get duty-free items

637
00:41:59,821 --> 00:42:02,198
without going on a trip?

638
00:42:02,824 --> 00:42:06,577
Yes, I'll personally deliver
items of your choosing.

639
00:42:06,661 --> 00:42:08,204
Try a little harder.

640
00:42:11,332 --> 00:42:13,209
Oh my, a door-to-door service?

641
00:42:13,292 --> 00:42:15,002
That is quite amazing!

642
00:42:16,337 --> 00:42:17,171
Oh my.

643
00:42:17,255 --> 00:42:19,423
Is this that miraculous cream
that flattens out

644
00:42:19,507 --> 00:42:21,634
every single wrinkle on you?

645
00:42:21,717 --> 00:42:23,010
You're right.

646
00:42:23,094 --> 00:42:24,804
You can give it a try.

647
00:42:25,388 --> 00:42:26,597
Let's see.

648
00:42:29,684 --> 00:42:30,518
My gosh.

649
00:42:31,102 --> 00:42:33,062
My eye wrinkles are disappearing.

650
00:42:33,145 --> 00:42:35,940
I feel ten years younger already.

651
00:42:38,234 --> 00:42:43,197
Yes, your wrinkles
really disappeared in an instant.

652
00:42:43,281 --> 00:42:45,533
Is this really only 59,900 won?

653
00:42:45,616 --> 00:42:46,993
Is this not too cheap?

654
00:42:47,702 --> 00:42:48,619
What's that?

655
00:42:49,203 --> 00:42:50,413
Let me test it too.

656
00:42:50,496 --> 00:42:52,290
Me too. Let me give it a try.

657
00:42:52,373 --> 00:42:53,624
- Me first.
- Okay.

658
00:42:53,708 --> 00:42:55,585
One second. Let me put it on you.

659
00:42:55,668 --> 00:42:56,711
I was here first.

660
00:42:57,336 --> 00:43:00,506
This is a limited edition
for in-flight duty-free services,

661
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:04,218
and a special promotion began
just this month.

662
00:43:04,302 --> 00:43:06,429
I saw this a few times
at department stores,

663
00:43:06,512 --> 00:43:09,140
but it was too tiny and expensive
for me to buy it.

664
00:43:09,765 --> 00:43:10,766
This is my chance.

665
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:12,643
How many can I get? I'll take them all.

666
00:43:12,727 --> 00:43:14,729
You can't take everything.

667
00:43:14,812 --> 00:43:16,230
Don't be like that, young lady.

668
00:43:16,314 --> 00:43:18,608
I can buy two of them.

669
00:43:18,691 --> 00:43:19,734
No, I'll take them all.

670
00:43:19,817 --> 00:43:21,611
How much can I get? Like 50?

671
00:43:21,694 --> 00:43:24,697
You have made a very wonderful decision.

672
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,574
- You look so much younger.
- Really?

673
00:43:26,657 --> 00:43:28,242
Yes, your wrinkles are gone.

674
00:43:28,326 --> 00:43:29,785
- Already?
- Yes!

675
00:43:35,416 --> 00:43:38,044
Mr. Gu, did you visit HR?

676
00:43:38,127 --> 00:43:38,961
Why?

677
00:43:39,045 --> 00:43:41,380
You couldn't find
an old personnel record, right?

678
00:43:41,464 --> 00:43:44,967
He matched up every single file
with the hard copies since your visit

679
00:43:45,051 --> 00:43:46,886
but found nothing and came to me crying.

680
00:43:47,386 --> 00:43:48,971
He's begging you for the name.

681
00:43:49,055 --> 00:43:49,972
Never mind.

682
00:43:50,056 --> 00:43:51,766
Who is it? Who are you looking for?

683
00:43:51,849 --> 00:43:52,767
It's fine.

684
00:43:53,309 --> 00:43:54,810
Isn't it in our online database?

685
00:43:54,894 --> 00:43:56,103
It was all digitized.

686
00:43:56,187 --> 00:43:58,814
It wasn't on the server.
That's why I went for a hard copy.

687
00:43:58,898 --> 00:44:01,275
Then the person
probably wasn't important here.

688
00:44:03,527 --> 00:44:04,445
What?

689
00:44:04,528 --> 00:44:07,323
If an employee's records
weren't kept in the files or the server,

690
00:44:07,406 --> 00:44:09,325
it means they weren't important.

691
00:44:09,408 --> 00:44:10,242
In a word,

692
00:44:10,326 --> 00:44:11,827
a nobody.

693
00:44:15,164 --> 00:44:16,248
What do you mean?

694
00:44:17,166 --> 00:44:18,209
Those who are powerful

695
00:44:18,292 --> 00:44:20,044
or important end up getting recorded.

696
00:44:20,127 --> 00:44:21,629
I mean, some go down in history.

697
00:44:22,254 --> 00:44:23,422
But for the rest of us,

698
00:44:23,506 --> 00:44:26,425
it doesn't matter
if we disappear without a trace,

699
00:44:27,259 --> 00:44:28,594
so their records get deleted.

700
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:31,055
<i>I'm telling you for your sake.</i>

701
00:44:31,138 --> 00:44:32,932
Don't end up like your mom.

702
00:44:33,641 --> 00:44:34,642
See?

703
00:44:34,725 --> 00:44:35,935
Nobody remembers her.

704
00:44:36,811 --> 00:44:39,230
<i>Both you and me.</i>

705
00:44:40,022 --> 00:44:41,357
<i>That's life for a loser.</i>

706
00:44:45,903 --> 00:44:47,863
No one in this world is a nobody.

707
00:44:58,457 --> 00:45:00,126
Come on in.

708
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,170
I expected the prince to be fussy,

709
00:45:03,254 --> 00:45:05,423
but he was rather friendly and polite.

710
00:45:06,424 --> 00:45:10,428
He also promised me he'd have
all of his guests stay here from now on.

711
00:45:10,511 --> 00:45:12,638
I knew you'd make this happen.

712
00:45:13,347 --> 00:45:14,390
Thank you.

713
00:45:15,641 --> 00:45:19,562
Invite Prince Samir
to our 100th anniversary.

714
00:45:19,645 --> 00:45:20,479
Yes, Father.

715
00:45:22,189 --> 00:45:24,859
I'd like to take charge
of the 100th-anniversary event.

716
00:45:25,484 --> 00:45:26,318
What?

717
00:45:26,402 --> 00:45:28,320
Do you know how important this is?

718
00:45:28,988 --> 00:45:32,450
We only invite the very elite
among our VIP guests.

719
00:45:32,533 --> 00:45:33,993
You can't handle that yet.

720
00:45:34,994 --> 00:45:36,495
Know your stuff before you speak.

721
00:45:36,579 --> 00:45:38,414
It's King Hotel's biggest event,

722
00:45:38,497 --> 00:45:40,166
so it must be held at King the Land.

723
00:45:41,542 --> 00:45:44,128
You must've had a tough time
managing everything alone.

724
00:45:44,962 --> 00:45:46,297
You can leave it to me now.

725
00:45:50,342 --> 00:45:52,178
Yes, you finally came to your senses.

726
00:45:52,762 --> 00:45:54,305
Okay, you can take charge.

727
00:45:54,388 --> 00:45:55,306
Father.

728
00:45:55,931 --> 00:45:57,308
Won can't handle this yet.

729
00:45:57,391 --> 00:46:00,770
Seeing how well he handled Prince Samir,
I think we can rely on him.

730
00:46:01,812 --> 00:46:05,065
Hwa-ran, have faith in him
and let him try this.

731
00:46:05,566 --> 00:46:06,817
You can do it, right?

732
00:46:07,401 --> 00:46:08,652
- Yes.
- Great.

733
00:46:10,362 --> 00:46:11,697
- Let's eat.
- Okay.

734
00:46:13,365 --> 00:46:14,742
Let's eat.

735
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:20,623
Are you really starting something with me?

736
00:46:21,207 --> 00:46:23,209
You said I'd have to
fight you for life here.

737
00:46:24,502 --> 00:46:26,253
It's inevitable, so I'll try my best.

738
00:46:28,422 --> 00:46:31,217
Do you think someone like you
has a chance against me?

739
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:32,635
I told you before

740
00:46:32,718 --> 00:46:36,472
that someone like you
shouldn't own the company.

741
00:46:36,555 --> 00:46:39,099
Since when did you care so much
about the company?

742
00:46:39,183 --> 00:46:40,643
It's because you went too far.

743
00:46:40,726 --> 00:46:43,562
If you placed an employee in danger
over some ginseng,

744
00:46:43,646 --> 00:46:45,105
you should've at least sent help.

745
00:46:45,189 --> 00:46:47,691
Or you could give the staff
the incentives they deserve

746
00:46:47,775 --> 00:46:49,318
for bringing up sales.

747
00:46:49,401 --> 00:46:50,778
What are you trying to do?

748
00:46:50,861 --> 00:46:55,157
The employees are supposed to
earn their paychecks.

749
00:46:56,408 --> 00:46:58,369
Why should we give them incentives

750
00:46:58,452 --> 00:46:59,703
simply for doing their job?

751
00:47:02,289 --> 00:47:04,208
- That sounds like you.
- Don't be snarky.

752
00:47:07,294 --> 00:47:08,963
What are you betting in this fight?

753
00:47:10,965 --> 00:47:12,049
I've put in everything.

754
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,385
I'm putting up my fight

755
00:47:15,511 --> 00:47:16,804
with everything on the line.

756
00:47:24,895 --> 00:47:26,814
I didn't want to fight.

757
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:29,775
But you keep getting me involved.

758
00:47:31,068 --> 00:47:34,655
I keep seeing employees suffering
from unfair treatment.

759
00:47:34,738 --> 00:47:36,156
I'm complicit if I stay put.

760
00:47:37,074 --> 00:47:39,493
I'm going to try and protect the people

761
00:47:40,369 --> 00:47:41,370
that you deem

762
00:47:42,496 --> 00:47:43,747
as nobodies.

763
00:47:50,421 --> 00:47:52,214
Who do you even think you are?

764
00:47:52,298 --> 00:47:54,341
At the very least, I have a conscience.

765
00:47:55,134 --> 00:47:56,552
So I'm better than you.

766
00:47:57,261 --> 00:47:58,721
Let's have a good fight.

767
00:48:03,517 --> 00:48:04,768
You know what?

768
00:48:06,145 --> 00:48:08,105
Those who fight for others…

769
00:48:10,357 --> 00:48:11,984
stand no chance against someone

770
00:48:12,985 --> 00:48:14,236
who fights for themselves.

771
00:48:17,781 --> 00:48:18,908
Good luck.

772
00:50:00,718 --> 00:50:01,760
What's this?

773
00:50:06,348 --> 00:50:07,850
Why are you there?

774
00:50:09,601 --> 00:50:11,228
Let go of me. Let go.

775
00:50:11,854 --> 00:50:13,897
Cheon Sa-rang.

776
00:50:13,981 --> 00:50:14,940
No.

777
00:50:15,024 --> 00:50:16,150
Let go of him.

778
00:50:16,233 --> 00:50:17,067
Let me go!

779
00:50:19,987 --> 00:50:20,988
No!

780
00:50:52,186 --> 00:50:53,228
{\an8}Hello, sir.

781
00:50:54,104 --> 00:50:55,689
<i>That's what you call being a nuisance.</i>

782
00:50:55,773 --> 00:50:58,567
It was a special request
from the head manager.

783
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:00,527
It may seem like a simple favor to you,

784
00:51:00,611 --> 00:51:03,447
but for us,
it's an order that must be obeyed.

785
00:51:08,243 --> 00:51:09,286
{\an8}I'm sorry.

786
00:51:09,369 --> 00:51:11,038
{\an8}Did I keep you here late?

787
00:51:11,121 --> 00:51:11,997
{\an8}No, sir.

788
00:51:12,081 --> 00:51:13,749
Even if it hadn't been you,

789
00:51:13,832 --> 00:51:17,169
it's only natural for us to serve
every single guest with utmost care.

790
00:51:17,252 --> 00:51:18,796
Please come by whenever you like.

791
00:51:19,588 --> 00:51:21,340
I'll leave on time in the future.

792
00:51:21,882 --> 00:51:22,883
{\an8}Goodbye.

793
00:51:37,523 --> 00:51:40,150
Tap on it and let it seep in.

794
00:51:40,943 --> 00:51:42,236
That's nice.

795
00:51:43,237 --> 00:51:44,363
Try it.

796
00:51:48,784 --> 00:51:49,618
Hello?

797
00:51:50,327 --> 00:51:51,620
May I see you?

798
00:51:52,371 --> 00:51:53,372
Right now?

799
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:56,166
I'm busy right now.

800
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:58,252
- <i>I'll see you next time.</i>
- I'll go to you.

801
00:51:59,253 --> 00:52:01,004
- You're going to come here?
- <i>Yes.</i>

802
00:52:01,088 --> 00:52:02,840
I have something to say too.

803
00:52:05,092 --> 00:52:07,136
- Is this important?
- <i>Yes.</i>

804
00:52:09,304 --> 00:52:12,141
This isn't a place
to say something important.

805
00:52:12,224 --> 00:52:13,142
I'll see you next time.

806
00:52:13,225 --> 00:52:14,852
No, I have to see you now.

807
00:52:15,602 --> 00:52:16,562
Where are you?

808
00:52:29,116 --> 00:52:32,911
SAMSAM SPA, HOT KILN SAUNA

809
00:53:02,733 --> 00:53:03,859
You found me all right.

810
00:53:03,942 --> 00:53:06,278
- Hey.
- And you're in sauna attire too.

811
00:53:07,237 --> 00:53:08,906
Why is everyone lounging around?

812
00:53:10,199 --> 00:53:11,116
It's a sauna.

813
00:53:13,118 --> 00:53:15,245
- Show me your arm.
- I know that.

814
00:53:15,829 --> 00:53:18,498
So why is everyone lying here
instead of at their homes?

815
00:53:19,333 --> 00:53:20,709
That's what people do here.

816
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:23,795
You have to wear it like this
not to lose it.

817
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,798
What did you have to say?

818
00:53:29,468 --> 00:53:30,677
Do I have to say it here?

819
00:53:30,761 --> 00:53:33,013
I told you.
That's why I wanted to see you later.

820
00:53:33,764 --> 00:53:35,390
- Let's go outside.
- No.

821
00:53:36,016 --> 00:53:37,100
My friends are here.

822
00:53:37,768 --> 00:53:39,603
- Your friends?
- Oh my, Mr. No!

823
00:53:41,772 --> 00:53:43,398
- What brings you here?
- Hey.

824
00:53:44,691 --> 00:53:46,360
You should go.

825
00:53:46,443 --> 00:53:47,945
It'll be a pain if you stay.

826
00:53:48,028 --> 00:53:49,279
Hurry and go.

827
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,824
I wanted you as my wingman,

828
00:53:52,908 --> 00:53:54,284
but you were an awful actor.

829
00:53:54,368 --> 00:53:56,912
I'm doing so well.
Everything is sold out thanks to me.

830
00:53:56,995 --> 00:53:59,248
Hey, I'm the one who did everything.

831
00:53:59,331 --> 00:54:01,291
You need to act naturally to draw a crowd.

832
00:54:02,334 --> 00:54:04,002
Mr. No, try one.

833
00:54:04,086 --> 00:54:05,295
I'm fine.

834
00:54:11,009 --> 00:54:12,261
Thank you.

835
00:54:24,314 --> 00:54:25,440
Anyway,

836
00:54:25,524 --> 00:54:26,900
wasn't I a good actor?

837
00:54:27,484 --> 00:54:30,028
You were totally awful. So rigid.

838
00:54:30,112 --> 00:54:32,322
You need to do better to draw people.

839
00:54:32,406 --> 00:54:33,824
Try to be more natural.

840
00:54:33,907 --> 00:54:36,618
Exactly. I said your role is important.

841
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:38,662
I won't help if you give me a hard time.

842
00:54:39,246 --> 00:54:40,163
Let's go.

843
00:54:44,835 --> 00:54:47,045
Did you skip dinner?

844
00:54:48,005 --> 00:54:49,548
Is it your first time trying these?

845
00:54:51,633 --> 00:54:53,802
I can't believe
you've never had these before.

846
00:54:54,594 --> 00:54:55,971
Try this too. Here.

847
00:54:57,472 --> 00:54:58,598
Thank you.

848
00:55:03,186 --> 00:55:05,188
By the way, what's with these?

849
00:55:05,272 --> 00:55:07,024
They don't seem like regular eggs.

850
00:55:07,107 --> 00:55:08,567
- Let's go.
- Aren't they good?

851
00:55:08,650 --> 00:55:10,360
They were roasted on a stone plate.

852
00:55:10,444 --> 00:55:11,486
Go on. You can have these.

853
00:55:11,570 --> 00:55:13,488
Goodness, thank you.

854
00:55:13,572 --> 00:55:14,906
Hey, wait.

855
00:55:16,074 --> 00:55:18,577
Are you here to eat eggs or to see me?

856
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:21,955
How could I leave before finishing these
when she kindly gave them to me?

857
00:55:24,249 --> 00:55:26,251
This is quite delicious.

858
00:55:40,807 --> 00:55:41,725
Wait.

859
00:55:42,392 --> 00:55:44,561
How about Mr. No instead of Sa-rang?

860
00:55:45,562 --> 00:55:46,396
Me?

861
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,982
The more the merrier, right?

862
00:55:49,066 --> 00:55:51,109
- I say yes.
- Why won't you ask me?

863
00:55:51,193 --> 00:55:53,528
Come on, we're all family.
Give her a hand.

864
00:55:53,612 --> 00:55:55,113
Just be a wingman.

865
00:55:55,197 --> 00:55:56,531
A wingman? For what?

866
00:55:57,616 --> 00:55:58,742
He's not good at it.

867
00:55:58,825 --> 00:55:59,743
It's not a big deal.

868
00:55:59,826 --> 00:56:01,745
All you have to do
is memorize a few lines.

869
00:56:22,974 --> 00:56:26,353
Wait, you can get duty-free items at home
without traveling abroad?

870
00:56:26,436 --> 00:56:29,815
Yes, and you get an extra 10% off too.

871
00:56:29,898 --> 00:56:32,401
Wait, an extra 10% off
of the duty-free prices?

872
00:56:32,484 --> 00:56:33,568
Yes.

873
00:56:33,652 --> 00:56:36,071
On top of that, just for today,

874
00:56:36,154 --> 00:56:39,116
if you purchase red ginseng extract,
you get one for free.

875
00:56:39,699 --> 00:56:41,910
Then I'll take four ginseng extract sets

876
00:56:41,993 --> 00:56:43,370
and three multivitamins.

877
00:56:43,453 --> 00:56:45,372
And one eye cream for you, babe.

878
00:56:46,164 --> 00:56:48,041
Get your stuff while they're on sale.

879
00:56:48,125 --> 00:56:50,168
You won't find another chance like this.

880
00:56:50,252 --> 00:56:53,046
Wait, red ginseng is half off?
Which brand?

881
00:56:53,130 --> 00:56:54,381
Let me see it too.

882
00:56:55,632 --> 00:56:57,134
It's this one.

883
00:56:57,217 --> 00:56:59,761
Right now, it's buy one, get one free.

884
00:56:59,845 --> 00:57:01,471
I see. Duty-free items.

885
00:57:01,555 --> 00:57:03,056
Is anything else on sale?

886
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:04,307
Everything.

887
00:57:04,391 --> 00:57:07,018
Cosmetics, liquor, accessories,
health supplements, everything.

888
00:57:07,102 --> 00:57:09,438
Take your time
and let me know whatever you need.

889
00:57:09,521 --> 00:57:11,189
- This one's good.
- It's cheaper than duty-free?

890
00:57:11,815 --> 00:57:12,941
Of course.

891
00:57:13,024 --> 00:57:15,444
I bought this from her last time,

892
00:57:15,527 --> 00:57:18,697
and it was half the price
you see at department stores.

893
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:20,824
You can't travel abroad every single day,

894
00:57:20,907 --> 00:57:22,492
so I think this is a great chance.

895
00:57:22,576 --> 00:57:23,702
This is wonderful.

896
00:57:23,785 --> 00:57:26,204
- My gosh.
- You want three? You won't even finish it.

897
00:57:26,288 --> 00:57:28,123
- Just get two.
- These are half off.

898
00:57:28,206 --> 00:57:31,001
- Two, two, two, so six packs.
- So cheap.

899
00:57:31,084 --> 00:57:32,878
- Right?
- This is great!

900
00:57:33,462 --> 00:57:35,589
You should probably get one each.

901
00:57:35,672 --> 00:57:36,965
This is the cheapest one.

902
00:57:37,048 --> 00:57:38,300
You wanted to get this.

903
00:57:38,383 --> 00:57:40,969
- Yes, this is it.
- Really?

904
00:57:41,052 --> 00:57:43,513
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

905
00:57:47,434 --> 00:57:50,562
You'll be able to reach the top
after a few more rounds.

906
00:57:50,645 --> 00:57:51,688
Thank you.

907
00:57:51,772 --> 00:57:53,982
I'll never forget your help.

908
00:57:54,524 --> 00:57:56,234
Thank you, Mr. No.

909
00:57:56,318 --> 00:57:58,403
Well, I'm good at everything.

910
00:57:58,487 --> 00:57:59,988
You were really good.

911
00:58:00,697 --> 00:58:02,741
You'll make a living
no matter where you go.

912
00:58:04,075 --> 00:58:06,578
Anyway, do you have to go this far?

913
00:58:06,661 --> 00:58:07,746
This is illegal.

914
00:58:08,747 --> 00:58:10,040
It's not illegal.

915
00:58:10,749 --> 00:58:11,583
It's not, right?

916
00:58:17,589 --> 00:58:19,257
It's not illegal, right?

917
00:58:21,551 --> 00:58:22,636
It is.

918
00:58:24,721 --> 00:58:25,972
It is?

919
00:58:27,808 --> 00:58:28,934
Only I didn't know?

920
00:58:29,976 --> 00:58:31,311
I'm sorry.

921
00:58:31,394 --> 00:58:32,813
I thought you knew.

922
00:58:32,896 --> 00:58:34,189
This is really wrong.

923
00:58:34,272 --> 00:58:35,440
Why are you taking it so far?

924
00:58:35,524 --> 00:58:37,108
Don't be so harsh on her.

925
00:58:37,192 --> 00:58:39,236
She must've been pressured into doing it.

926
00:58:39,319 --> 00:58:41,780
And she's paying
for that extra discount too.

927
00:58:41,863 --> 00:58:43,490
Why would you even spend your own money?

928
00:58:43,573 --> 00:58:44,658
What if you get caught?

929
00:58:44,741 --> 00:58:46,326
Because I have to.

930
00:58:50,038 --> 00:58:51,248
Let's stop now.

931
00:58:51,915 --> 00:58:53,416
Wrongdoing isn't for everyone.

932
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:57,295
People like us can't sleep in peace
after we do something wrong.

933
00:58:58,588 --> 00:59:00,173
This darned conscience.

934
00:59:00,257 --> 00:59:02,676
Why do we stay honest
when nobody gives us the credit?

935
00:59:02,759 --> 00:59:03,927
Who cares if no one does?

936
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:05,095
We can give it to each other.

937
00:59:06,221 --> 00:59:09,474
We all know that
Pyeong-hwa is a great worker.

938
00:59:09,558 --> 00:59:11,768
Yes, our little bear is the best.

939
00:59:12,853 --> 00:59:13,895
Stop it.

940
00:59:14,813 --> 00:59:16,231
Who cares if it's just you two?

941
00:59:16,314 --> 00:59:17,858
I'll give you the credit too.

942
00:59:18,441 --> 00:59:20,318
What good is that, Mr. No?

943
00:59:20,402 --> 00:59:22,070
But still, I'll give it to you.

944
00:59:22,153 --> 00:59:25,323
I'll remember that the company
made you take things this far.

945
00:59:26,241 --> 00:59:27,659
I won't forget it.

946
00:59:28,535 --> 00:59:29,870
Thank you for saying that.

947
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:33,957
The ones who should know that
are those up high and not you, Mr. No.

948
00:59:41,464 --> 00:59:43,842
You'll see a better day. I know it.

949
00:59:44,718 --> 00:59:46,344
Let's make a toast for that day.

950
00:59:47,762 --> 00:59:49,514
Sounds great. Cheers!

951
00:59:49,598 --> 00:59:51,099
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

952
00:59:53,977 --> 00:59:56,479
It was wonderful to see you
try so hard today.

953
00:59:57,689 --> 00:59:59,357
You were the best one.

954
01:00:07,282 --> 01:00:08,366
Mr. No?

955
01:00:09,242 --> 01:00:10,368
Do you want to play?

956
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:21,176
Mr. No.

957
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:22,928
You like Sa-rang, right?

958
01:00:23,721 --> 01:00:25,472
Do you even need to ask?

959
01:00:25,556 --> 01:00:26,432
It's so obvious.

960
01:00:27,057 --> 01:00:27,891
No.

961
01:00:27,975 --> 01:00:29,226
What? Really?

962
01:00:29,852 --> 01:00:32,896
Then we'll lose you
and go with the Arab prince.

963
01:00:33,647 --> 01:00:35,482
Why are you bringing him up right now?

964
01:00:35,566 --> 01:00:38,736
He's a total player
with the worst personality.

965
01:00:38,819 --> 01:00:41,572
He called Sa-rang last night.

966
01:00:41,655 --> 01:00:45,284
He offered to fly us out to Dubai
on a private jet this summer.

967
01:00:45,367 --> 01:00:47,494
That prince's generosity
is out of this world.

968
01:00:47,578 --> 01:00:49,788
We're in for a treat thanks to Sa-rang.

969
01:00:49,872 --> 01:00:51,165
He called?

970
01:00:51,790 --> 01:00:52,666
Wait.

971
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:56,587
I clearly remember you two saying
I pass as Sa-rang's boyfriend.

972
01:00:56,670 --> 01:00:58,672
You both said you'd take my side.

973
01:00:58,756 --> 01:00:59,673
Me?

974
01:00:59,757 --> 01:01:00,591
Yes.

975
01:01:00,674 --> 01:01:03,552
To be exact, it was both of you,
including Pyeong-hwa.

976
01:01:03,635 --> 01:01:04,845
Me too?

977
01:01:04,928 --> 01:01:07,681
Yes, I clearly remember your approval.

978
01:01:09,475 --> 01:01:12,061
My gosh. Is betrayal your specialty?

979
01:01:13,103 --> 01:01:14,188
This isn't betrayal.

980
01:01:14,271 --> 01:01:16,273
We're just being smart.

981
01:01:16,356 --> 01:01:18,067
Dubai is calling us!

982
01:01:24,073 --> 01:01:26,366
Hey, we're all one big family.

983
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:27,701
Let's not do this.

984
01:01:27,785 --> 01:01:30,287
But you said you didn't like her.

985
01:01:30,370 --> 01:01:32,539
So I think we're done here.

986
01:01:32,623 --> 01:01:33,540
Wait.

987
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:35,793
Let us

988
01:01:36,835 --> 01:01:38,003
chat some more

989
01:01:38,754 --> 01:01:40,714
until we use up all these coins.

990
01:01:44,176 --> 01:01:45,094
Please sit.

991
01:01:49,556 --> 01:01:50,724
<i>Round One.</i>

992
01:01:51,558 --> 01:01:52,935
<i>Ready, go!</i>

993
01:01:53,018 --> 01:01:53,977
Tell her.

994
01:01:54,978 --> 01:01:55,896
Tell her what?

995
01:01:55,979 --> 01:01:57,397
How you feel.

996
01:01:57,481 --> 01:01:58,857
"I like you. Go out with me."

997
01:01:58,941 --> 01:02:00,651
How is that so difficult?

998
01:02:01,693 --> 01:02:04,154
Do I have to say it in words?

999
01:02:05,030 --> 01:02:06,323
It's the heart that counts.

1000
01:02:06,406 --> 01:02:08,075
She won't know if you don't say it.

1001
01:02:08,158 --> 01:02:11,161
If you keep beating around the bush,
you'll end up losing her.

1002
01:02:12,162 --> 01:02:13,497
Just ask her out.

1003
01:02:42,317 --> 01:02:43,277
Nice!

1004
01:02:46,613 --> 01:02:47,906
<i>K.O. Nice!</i>

1005
01:02:55,038 --> 01:02:56,415
Isn't a cold treat nice

1006
01:02:56,498 --> 01:02:58,542
after sitting in the hot sauna?

1007
01:02:58,625 --> 01:02:59,543
Yes.

1008
01:02:59,626 --> 01:03:01,044
I get why people come here.

1009
01:03:04,923 --> 01:03:06,592
Thank you for today.

1010
01:03:07,342 --> 01:03:10,053
We're all one big family,
so we should help each other out.

1011
01:03:12,764 --> 01:03:14,016
You've changed a lot.

1012
01:03:14,975 --> 01:03:18,228
You used to be so scathing,
but you even make jokes now.

1013
01:03:31,867 --> 01:03:33,076
Are you free next weekend?

1014
01:03:35,162 --> 01:03:36,288
Why do you ask?

1015
01:03:37,956 --> 01:03:40,918
I want to talk about us.

1016
01:03:42,669 --> 01:03:44,087
About us?

1017
01:03:45,422 --> 01:03:47,299
Yes, about us.

1018
01:03:49,927 --> 01:03:51,178
Let's talk about us.

1019
01:03:58,769 --> 01:03:59,603
Okay.

1020
01:05:06,461 --> 01:05:09,089
WONSIKDANG

1021
01:05:26,189 --> 01:05:27,149
Welcome.

1022
01:05:27,232 --> 01:05:28,567
What's all this?

1023
01:05:28,650 --> 01:05:30,277
Are you Ms. Cheon Sa-rang?

1024
01:05:31,111 --> 01:05:33,238
- Yes.
- May I take your coat?

1025
01:05:34,448 --> 01:05:35,490
Thank you.

1026
01:05:45,375 --> 01:05:46,960
This way, please.

1027
01:05:49,838 --> 01:05:51,089
Thank you.

1028
01:05:56,511 --> 01:05:59,931
Our restaurant only serves
the chef's special.

1029
01:06:00,015 --> 01:06:01,141
Is that all right?

1030
01:06:01,641 --> 01:06:04,353
Yes, please serve me your best.

1031
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:07,439
So who's the chef?

1032
01:06:07,522 --> 01:06:08,607
I'm today's chef,

1033
01:06:08,690 --> 01:06:09,983
Gu Won.

1034
01:06:10,067 --> 01:06:11,526
I see. Do you also cook?

1035
01:06:12,110 --> 01:06:15,322
It'd be faster if you asked
for the things I couldn't do.

1036
01:06:16,865 --> 01:06:20,660
I remember that
you couldn't even peel an onion.

1037
01:06:20,744 --> 01:06:22,746
Please forget that ancient history.

1038
01:06:22,829 --> 01:06:26,166
I received special training
from the best chef,

1039
01:06:26,249 --> 01:06:28,043
so please be rest assured.

1040
01:06:28,126 --> 01:06:29,336
You're quite passionate.

1041
01:06:29,878 --> 01:06:31,380
I will let go of my worries.

1042
01:06:31,463 --> 01:06:34,716
I'm solely in charge
of cooking and serving tonight.

1043
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:35,926
So I ask

1044
01:06:36,009 --> 01:06:39,054
for your generous understanding
even if you face a bit of delay.

1045
01:06:39,137 --> 01:06:40,555
Sure, I'm okay with that.

1046
01:06:40,639 --> 01:06:43,016
Please take your time
and bring me delicious dishes.

1047
01:06:48,814 --> 01:06:51,108
We must have a drink on a night like this.

1048
01:06:52,901 --> 01:06:55,278
I made this sangria myself.

1049
01:06:56,822 --> 01:06:58,657
You made this yourself?

1050
01:06:58,740 --> 01:06:59,574
Yes.

1051
01:07:00,242 --> 01:07:01,535
Let me try it.

1052
01:07:09,418 --> 01:07:10,710
This is really good.

1053
01:07:15,924 --> 01:07:17,509
The appetizer.

1054
01:07:21,263 --> 01:07:23,765
How could I eat something this cute?

1055
01:07:23,849 --> 01:07:25,058
Then you can just stare at it.

1056
01:07:25,142 --> 01:07:26,726
No, I must try it.

1057
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:28,145
Thank you.

1058
01:07:33,859 --> 01:07:35,861
- This is so good.
- Of course.

1059
01:07:35,944 --> 01:07:37,988
So you really can cook.

1060
01:07:38,071 --> 01:07:40,073
The problem is that
I'm good at everything.

1061
01:07:40,157 --> 01:07:41,825
Look forward to the next dish.

1062
01:07:41,908 --> 01:07:42,951
Okay.

1063
01:08:34,961 --> 01:08:36,546
Pasta.

1064
01:08:37,297 --> 01:08:39,049
Let me try this.

1065
01:08:47,349 --> 01:08:48,934
This is really good.

1066
01:08:49,559 --> 01:08:50,602
You should try it too.

1067
01:08:51,811 --> 01:08:52,896
Here.

1068
01:08:58,109 --> 01:08:59,778
- Pretty good.
- It's not just good.

1069
01:08:59,861 --> 01:09:01,905
It's really delicious.

1070
01:09:02,697 --> 01:09:03,532
Chef Gu.

1071
01:09:04,866 --> 01:09:06,409
This is excellent.

1072
01:09:06,493 --> 01:09:08,662
Thank you for noticing.

1073
01:09:08,745 --> 01:09:10,330
You made it all worthwhile.

1074
01:09:11,289 --> 01:09:14,042
Anyway, what's the occasion?

1075
01:09:16,294 --> 01:09:19,047
It's a very important day.

1076
01:09:20,215 --> 01:09:21,424
What is it?

1077
01:09:22,676 --> 01:09:24,302
A day to treat my VIP, Ms. Cheon.

1078
01:09:25,804 --> 01:09:27,806
It finally hit me when Samir was here.

1079
01:09:28,431 --> 01:09:31,726
I found out what it felt like
to humor and serve all kinds of jerks.

1080
01:09:32,519 --> 01:09:36,481
Then I realized you must've made
a lot of effort to be the best talent,

1081
01:09:37,482 --> 01:09:39,234
so I wanted to treat you with my best.

1082
01:09:40,694 --> 01:09:41,778
I knew it.

1083
01:09:42,612 --> 01:09:46,241
I felt like I was warmly welcomed
as soon as I entered.

1084
01:09:46,324 --> 01:09:47,659
I'm glad you felt that way.

1085
01:09:48,243 --> 01:09:49,452
So sincerity always works.

1086
01:09:50,912 --> 01:09:52,205
Thank you.

1087
01:09:52,289 --> 01:09:55,625
It's an honor to enjoy
such wonderful dishes.

1088
01:09:58,670 --> 01:09:59,754
Also,

1089
01:10:01,131 --> 01:10:04,718
I'd like to have
a serious conversation with you.

1090
01:10:06,219 --> 01:10:07,637
What's it about?

1091
01:10:10,307 --> 01:10:12,100
That's to come after dinner.

1092
01:10:12,684 --> 01:10:13,977
I'll tell you then.

1093
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:16,980
The best part is yet to come,
so give me a minute.

1094
01:10:17,063 --> 01:10:18,231
What is it?

1095
01:10:19,649 --> 01:10:20,692
Do you want to know?

1096
01:10:25,405 --> 01:10:27,532
- May I have another glass?
- One second.

1097
01:10:27,616 --> 01:10:29,951
- I'll bring it over after this.
- I can get it.

1098
01:10:42,589 --> 01:10:45,300
You're kind of cool today.

1099
01:10:45,383 --> 01:10:46,635
I'm always cool.

1100
01:10:50,263 --> 01:10:51,097
Now.

1101
01:10:51,973 --> 01:10:54,184
This is the highlight of the meal.

1102
01:11:25,256 --> 01:11:27,300
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

1103
01:11:28,343 --> 01:11:29,386
No.

1104
01:11:33,598 --> 01:11:35,058
What will you do with all these?

1105
01:11:40,647 --> 01:11:42,023
As long as you aren't hurt,

1106
01:11:42,857 --> 01:11:43,942
it's all right.

1107
01:12:30,363 --> 01:12:31,823
Do I have…

1108
01:12:33,032 --> 01:12:34,159
permission?

1109
01:14:45,915 --> 01:14:48,918
KING THE LAND

1110
01:15:21,492 --> 01:15:23,494
{\an8}<i>- Are you upset?
- As if.</i>

1111
01:15:23,578 --> 01:15:24,787
{\an8}Don't be upset.

1112
01:15:26,289 --> 01:15:27,707
{\an8}- That's not--
- Forget it.

1113
01:15:27,790 --> 01:15:29,876
{\an8}<i>You have feelings for Sa-rang, don't you?</i>

1114
01:15:33,421 --> 01:15:35,924
{\an8}You don't pass as Sa-rang's partner.

1115
01:15:36,007 --> 01:15:37,300
{\an8}Be careful!

1116
01:15:39,093 --> 01:15:39,928
{\an8}Sa-rang!

1117
01:15:41,638 --> 01:15:42,847
{\an8}<i>Mr. Gu!</i>

1118
01:15:42,931 --> 01:15:45,642
{\an8}<i>I heard you finally declared war
against Ms. Gu.</i>

1119
01:15:45,725 --> 01:15:47,894
{\an8}I will take charge of the hotel.

1120
01:15:48,686 --> 01:15:49,812
{\an8}<i>Are you okay?</i>

1121
01:15:50,438 --> 01:15:51,564
{\an8}No.

1122
01:15:51,648 --> 01:15:54,192
{\an8}<i>I'll leave in a bit.
It's because I want to see you.</i>

1123
01:15:54,275 --> 01:15:55,860
{\an8}Mr. Gu!
