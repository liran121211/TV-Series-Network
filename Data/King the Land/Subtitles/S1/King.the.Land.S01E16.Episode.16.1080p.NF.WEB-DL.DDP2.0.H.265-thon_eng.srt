1
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,962
KING THE LAND

2
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:49,382
Are you not going to tell me?

3
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,843
Do you want to see me die of frustration?

4
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:56,973
It's just…

5
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,268
I have a lot on my mind.

6
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,396
I'm wondering if the work I'm doing now

7
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:08,359
is what I really wanted to do at a hotel.

8
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,033
This isn't what I dreamed of.

9
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:23,917
I know.

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,462
I should be thankful for my job there
instead of complaining.

11
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,301
Goodness.

12
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:38,848
My baby has finally learned
to grumble and whine.

13
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,434
I always wondered

14
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:44,604
if I'd be able to see you do this
before I passed away.

15
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,529
What are you saying?

16
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,697
You should be telling me off,

17
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,617
saying that I can't have it all
and to just do my job.

18
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,954
No matter how well-known a restaurant is,

19
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:03,456
it's no use if it's not to your liking.

20
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,958
Who cares about the hotel?

21
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,836
You only live once.

22
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,588
You should do what you really want to do.

23
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:13,341
Don't mind other people,

24
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,009
and don't hesitate either.

25
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,011
Do everything you want to.

26
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,806
If it isn't the way,
you can take a detour.

27
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:22,725
If you fall off a cliff,
you can climb up again.

28
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,478
Okay?

29
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,901
Okay.

30
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,779
Okay, Grandma.

31
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,075
You'll be fine.

32
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,370
I'm here for you,
so do whatever you want to do.

33
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:44,914
You deserve it.

34
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,128
Okay.

35
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:51,921
I'll do that.

36
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,089
Good.

37
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,730
I'm done.

38
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,482
I want to leave.

39
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,339
What do you exactly mean…

40
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,260
by leaving?

41
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,973
I want to quit my job at the hotel.

42
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,564
Was there a specific reason

43
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,359
that made you want to quit?

44
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:06,579
To me, a hotel was a place of happiness.

45
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,041
And that's why I became a concierge.

46
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,670
I wanted to provide the happiest day

47
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,547
to every guest who stayed at the hotel.

48
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:20,343
But what I'm doing right now
seems far from that.

49
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,846
Although King the Land may be fancy,

50
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,099
and I may make a lot of money
in the Dream Team,

51
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,143
it's not the life I want.

52
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:31,896
I also…

53
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,109
want to write my own story.

54
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,375
It sounded like a tough decision,

55
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,587
but it was a happy resolution.

56
00:04:58,923 --> 00:04:59,924
That's true.

57
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:05,305
I want to make a hotel of my own,
no matter how tiny it is.

58
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,724
I want to try it on my own.

59
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:16,232
One second.

60
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,529
It's me.

61
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,031
Please cancel the event.

62
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,741
Thank you.

63
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,953
What did you just cancel?

64
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,790
It was something important.

65
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:37,962
But I'll do it later.

66
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:45,678
I'm sorry.

67
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:46,971
I must've startled you.

68
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,306
Don't be.

69
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,019
Congratulations.

70
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,147
You found what you really wanted to do,

71
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,566
and you're determined to try it.

72
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,610
Congratulations.

73
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:06,532
Perhaps that was
what I most wanted to hear from you.

74
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,118
Thank you

75
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,079
for sharing

76
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:13,831
your honest feelings.

77
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,961
But promise me one thing.

78
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,631
What is it?

79
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,133
When you work alone,

80
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,137
you'll face many difficulties.

81
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:33,142
You'll come across things
that are tough for you to bear alone.

82
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,186
When that happens, don't hesitate…

83
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:38,940
and call me.

84
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,776
I'll run over right away.

85
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,217
You're the prettiest today
since the day we first met.

86
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,593
You're dazzling.

87
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,888
I was going to blow my nose,
but I can't now that you said that.

88
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,099
Just blow your nose.

89
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:14,684
Even that looks pretty to me.

90
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:19,147
So what did you want to say to me?

91
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:21,816
Oh.

92
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:29,699
No matter where you are,

93
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,827
no matter what you do,

94
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,790
I'll always be on your side.

95
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,628
I wanted to tell you that.

96
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:51,512
Thank you.

97
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:54,140
Me too.

98
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,643
I'll always be on your side.

99
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,397
Excuse me.

100
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,982
May I take a photo of you two?

101
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,817
Sure.

102
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,154
You look great.

103
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,032
I'll take the photo now.

104
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:13,409
One, two, three.

105
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,120
Could you take one more?

106
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,337
Okay, one more time.

107
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,757
One, two, three.

108
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,222
FINALE

109
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,589
Thank you for seeing me today.

110
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:12,802
How could I turn down your offer
to treat me to a meal?

111
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:16,764
Are you trying to
kill your enemy with kindness?

112
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,642
I wanted to tell you something.

113
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,896
Yes, I'm sure you have lots to say.

114
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,148
I'm listening.

115
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,027
Well…

116
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,157
I would like to quit.

117
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,618
I came to tell you that.

118
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,373
May I ask

119
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:44,625
the reason?

120
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:46,794
I want to quit

121
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,714
and date him out in the open.

122
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,757
If I stay here,

123
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,968
I'd have to continue
following your orders.

124
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:58,222
Did you come to declare war?

125
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:03,894
I came to a realization
after spending time away from him.

126
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,522
I love him so much

127
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,400
that I can't live without him.

128
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,240
You may not be happy with me,

129
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,493
but I know I won't disappoint you.

130
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,133
This is exactly why I like you!

131
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:42,725
I apologize for my immaturity

132
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,436
and for not separating the personal
from the professional.

133
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,355
When it comes to my children,

134
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:48,773
I become rather ambitious.

135
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:52,485
It's all right. I understand.

136
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,572
Thanks to you,
I reached the highest position possible

137
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,992
and found out what I truly wanted.

138
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,203
So thank you.

139
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,918
That's why I'm going to do something
I really want to do.

140
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:09,835
I see.

141
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,880
I'm sure you'll do a great job,
no matter what it is.

142
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:15,883
Thank you.

143
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:20,137
It's my treat today, so please enjoy.

144
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:22,973
All right.

145
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:24,975
Thank you.

146
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:26,769
I'll enjoy it.

147
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,652
So delicious.

148
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,419
Sa-rang, thank you for your hard work.

149
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,547
This is for you. It's from all of us.

150
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,050
Thank you.

151
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,220
I learned so much from everyone.

152
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,681
Don't forget us no matter where you go.

153
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,266
I hope you'll always be happy.

154
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,229
Thank you, everyone.

155
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,273
I'll miss you all.

156
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,028
And Ms. Jeon,

157
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,657
you always helped me greatly.

158
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,243
I'll never forget that.

159
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,333
You've done well.

160
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,214
I want to hug her too.

161
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,340
Me too.

162
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,261
-Sa-rang.
-Don't go.

163
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,512
-Great work.
-Gosh.

164
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,889
You'll stay in touch, right?

165
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,891
-Yes.
-Don't forget us.

166
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,458
"President Gu Won."

167
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:19,924
Sa-rang.

168
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,886
-Hello.
-It's your last day.

169
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,596
It is.

170
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,223
Mr. Gu went out to work.

171
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,307
It's okay.

172
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,310
Anyway, with our kind Ms. Sa-rang gone,

173
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,062
who will watch over King Hotel?

174
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,315
The talented Mr. No is here,
so why are you worried?

175
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,775
That's true, right?

176
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,152
But with you gone,

177
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,363
my life will be too tiresome.

178
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,615
I must deal with his temper alone.

179
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,158
Don't say that.

180
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,578
He's very considerate of you.
Please take good care of him.

181
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,206
So he said that behind my back?

182
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,334
We should all get together soon
for a drink.

183
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:56,627
Okay, let's meet up.

184
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,670
Sounds good.

185
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:01,757
Good work.

186
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:08,764
Thank you.

187
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:11,892
I'll root for you.

188
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,314
Wait, why are you crying?

189
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,358
I am?

190
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:20,609
-Come on.
-I'll leave.

191
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,528
-What's with you?
-Are you staying? Bye.

192
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,446
CHEON SA-RANG

193
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,604
CHEON SA-RANG

194
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,944
Wait, how did you find me here?

195
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:29,989
Congrats on your new chapter.

196
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:35,786
Thank you.

197
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:36,954
One second.

198
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,462
They say good shoes

199
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,090
take you to good places.

200
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:09,153
They're so pretty.

201
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:11,697
Thank you

202
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,950
for all of your hard work…

203
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,496
at King Hotel.

204
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,296
I get to leave with great memories
thanks to you.

205
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,548
Thank you.

206
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,341
Good work,

207
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,804
our number one best talent.

208
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,099
I was happy here,

209
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,393
President Gu Won.

210
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,936
You're always welcome to visit.

211
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,938
We'll have you as our VVIP guest.

212
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,065
It's an honor.

213
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,233
Please make me the VVVVVVIP.

214
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,780
-Shall we?
-Okay.

215
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,408
-Can you give me 1,000 won?
-What?

216
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:59,036
I hear I need to get money
after giving shoes as a gift.

217
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,579
Only then will you not run away.

218
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,624
You're right. You knew that?

219
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,043
I can give you 1,000 won.

220
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:08,045
Wait, my wallet!

221
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,380
-Where is it?
-We left everything at the bus stop.

222
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,381
Sir, stop the car!

223
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,781
These chores never end.

224
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,076
I'll end up developing hand eczema.

225
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:44,289
-Put these on.
-Are you a wolf in sheep's clothing?

226
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:46,667
Thanks a lot.

227
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,086
I'm about to cry tears of gratitude.

228
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:52,172
If you have to do it anyway,
try to enjoy it.

229
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,632
But this isn't enjoyable!

230
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:56,093
I have no pleasure in life,
stuck at home all day!

231
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:00,139
It's your day off. You're leaving?

232
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,099
I signed up for a workout.

233
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,768
What? Are you out of your mind?

234
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,855
You need to help me out at home
on your day off!

235
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,690
Get a job within the month,

236
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,650
or I'm really done with you.

237
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:14,361
Do the dishes and clean the bathroom too.

238
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,864
Why am I the only one who has to do this?

239
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:28,917
Don't worry and go, Mom.

240
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,294
I'll keep my eyes on him.

241
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,753
Cho-rong, what's this?

242
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,005
An army drill sergeant.

243
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,798
These guys are the scariest.

244
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,593
You've got ten minutes.

245
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,553
Finish up in ten minutes. Understood?

246
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,514
No, I don't understand.

247
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,474
Then bunny hop until you get it!

248
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,518
Great job, Cho-rong.

249
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,229
Keep an eye on him. I'll be quick.

250
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,939
Okay, be careful of the traffic.

251
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,524
Yes, ma'am!

252
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,505
Thank you.

253
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:18,926
Please.

254
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,308
What do you think?

255
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:29,561
It does smell quite different.

256
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,146
It tastes completely different.

257
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,066
We know that too,

258
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,902
but I don't think it's necessary

259
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:40,239
to place premium coffee machines
used in junior suites and higher

260
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,782
in standard rooms as well.

261
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:43,116
I agree.

262
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,744
It blurs the service differentiation
between room types.

263
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:50,832
The standard room
is our most popular unit, right?

264
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:54,419
-Yes.
-Do you think it's a waste

265
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:57,214
to provide better coffee and services

266
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:58,674
to the majority of our guests?

267
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,220
They won't notice.
Is this change necessary?

268
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,473
It all tastes the same.

269
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:13,397
These small changes are what set us apart.

270
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,108
Our hotel has a simple principle.

271
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:18,235
Regardless of the room they're staying in,

272
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:22,197
we consider every single guest
at our hotel a VIP.

273
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,867
That is our new principle.

274
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:30,747
Well then.

275
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,835
Then we'll change the water too.

276
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:35,877
Thank you.

277
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:39,339
May we move on to the next item?

278
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,257
Yes.

279
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,342
The next item

280
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:45,512
is breaking into the European market.

281
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:49,308
According to market research,
tourists have increased,

282
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:52,477
but the revenues of global hotel chains
continue to drop.

283
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:56,023
The needs of guests continue to grow
more detailed and diverse.

284
00:21:56,106 --> 00:22:00,694
We won't break into the market
as a large-scale hotel chain.

285
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:04,448
Focus on purchasing luxury mansions
that can accommodate up to 20 rooms.

286
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:07,701
A single chain with a thousand styles.

287
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:11,913
That's our strategy
for the European market.

288
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,085
So this will turn into our staff lounge?

289
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,129
I'm telling you. Why won't you believe me?

290
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:20,922
We'll really get massage chairs too?

291
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,341
And a nap room too.

292
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,675
No way.

293
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,303
Then we can truly relax
when we go on breaks, right?

294
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,305
Sure.

295
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:32,517
It's all thanks to Mr. Gu.

296
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,019
You should be grateful,

297
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:35,479
work harder when you work,

298
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:37,189
and rest well on breaks. Okay?

299
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:38,315
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

300
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,526
Jeez, what are you doing?

301
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,570
-New cologne?
-It's what I always use.

302
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:45,697
What's this?
Pull your arm out. You're gross.

303
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:48,325
A new position, a new scent.

304
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:49,701
How charming.

305
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:53,038
When will I get promoted
to a position worthy of such a scent?

306
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,081
I really wonder.

307
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,594
We need to talk.

308
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,598
-This is for me?
-Yes.

309
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:13,850
-It looks bad.
-This is good.

310
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,686
Why are you suddenly so nice to me?

311
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:17,813
It doesn't suit you.

312
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,071
This actually tastes good.

313
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,531
It's good.

314
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:33,370
Is that for me?

315
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:35,872
What could it be?

316
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,082
Should I open it?

317
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:43,255
Business cards?

318
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:45,090
I still have lots left.

319
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,011
NO SANG-SIK
STRATEGIC PLANNING DEPARTMENT MANAGER

320
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,016
I'm a department manager?

321
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:58,103
-You are.
-I'm a department manager!

322
00:23:58,186 --> 00:23:59,855
I'm a department manager!

323
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:06,736
Are you that happy about it?

324
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,321
Why am I not the head manager?

325
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:09,281
What?

326
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:11,825
Ms. Gu said she would make me
the head manager.

327
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,660
I should have switched over then.

328
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,412
I shouldn't have stayed loyal.

329
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:16,580
There's no reward.

330
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:17,956
This is such a shame.

331
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:22,294
I honestly thought
you'd make me the head manager.

332
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:23,295
You don't like

333
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:25,505
department manager?

334
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:26,798
It's not that.

335
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,259
It's just a bummer
that there's no head manager.

336
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:31,511
It'd be wonderful
to change this to "head."

337
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:32,888
"Head Manager No Sang-sik."

338
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:37,100
In that case…

339
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,402
I guess you won't need this either.

340
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,446
What is this?

341
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,741
May I open it? I'm doing it.

342
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:56,870
You said you didn't need it.

343
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:00,707
It's a watch.

344
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:04,377
Mr. Gu, your generosity knows no bounds.

345
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:07,714
Not only are you handsome,
but you're also charming and cool.

346
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:09,716
That's why you're dating someone.

347
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:11,843
You didn't want it. Give it back.

348
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,221
No takebacks. You gave it to me.

349
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:15,222
-Bring it here.
-No.

350
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,682
I will work here until my death.

351
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:18,600
Thanks a lot.

352
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,352
You didn't want it. Give it back.

353
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:22,938
Thank you for the promotion!
We go hard! Let's go!

354
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,357
Thanks!

355
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,150
Thank you!

356
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:31,905
It is I, Department Manager No!

357
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:49,047
HOUSING LISTINGS

358
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,382
Did you find a place?

359
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:51,841
I'm still looking.

360
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:55,053
What's your theme?
Let's look it up together.

361
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:56,721
That's a secret.

362
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,473
Come on, don't be like that.

363
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,017
I found one.

364
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,770
I'll call you back.

365
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:18,827
Hello, I saw one of your listings online.

366
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,578
May I see the building?

367
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:24,749
Right, the listing number is 15017.

368
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:47,522
Hello, I'm calling
about one of your listings.

369
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:54,696
Not this one.

370
00:26:58,533 --> 00:26:59,826
I don't think this is it.

371
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:03,121
Not this one either.

372
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:08,043
I'm calling about listing number 10591.

373
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,210
I see.

374
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,962
I wanted to see a building you have.

375
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,630
All right.

376
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,305
I finally found it!

377
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:23,933
Congratulations.

378
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:40,617
CHEON SA-RANG

379
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,294
-You're opening your business
-You're opening your business

380
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,963
-You're opening your business
-You're opening your business

381
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:56,299
-Congratulations, dear Sa-rang
-Congratulations, dear Sa-rang

382
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:58,927
-You're opening your business
-You're opening your business

383
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,304
FINALLY A BOSS

384
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,308
-Congratulations!
-Thank you.

385
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,018
I'm so proud of you.

386
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:09,312
There's finally a boss among us.

387
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:10,897
An owner of a hotel, at that.

388
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,983
Who cares if I'm the owner
when I'm the only staff?

389
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:16,152
Girls like her are the scariest.

390
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,071
She said she never wanted much,
but now she owns a hotel!

391
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:20,865
I took out a huge mortgage,
and there's only one room.

392
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,201
And that single room is a suite.

393
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:24,953
Of course, all rooms are suites.

394
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,538
The cream of the crop.

395
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:30,333
Thank you always
for seeing things in a better light.

396
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:32,836
I'm so happy I'm friends with you two.

397
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,045
You two are the best!

398
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:37,799
You realized that just now?
Of course we're the best.

399
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,511
Now, let me mix some drinks.

400
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:43,471
Sounds great. Okay.

401
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,765
KETTLE-COOKED COW'S HEAD GUKBAP

402
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,019
CHA SUN-HUI

403
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:56,317
Hey, Sa-rang.

404
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,527
Cheon Sa-rang?

405
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:58,987
I'm busy, Grandma.

406
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,280
Come here.

407
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:05,410
What is it? I'm busy.

408
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:08,037
I still have a ton of dishes left.

409
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:11,207
Did something good happen?

410
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:14,961
What's this?

411
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,629
All of your daily wages.

412
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:19,591
You gave me pocket money each time.

413
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:21,050
Think of it as severance pay.

414
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,887
I wasn't even a full-time employee.

415
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,768
How much is this?
One, two, three, four, five, six…

416
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:31,436
Grandma!

417
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:34,773
Thanks for helping me out
even with your busy schedule.

418
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,401
No, I can't take this. It's yours.

419
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,488
And this here

420
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:45,408
is the money from selling
the wild ginseng you dug up

421
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:46,951
from Mount Jiri or whatever.

422
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:51,873
Why did you sell it?
I told you to have it yourself.

423
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:53,500
Jeez.

424
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,380
Wait, 150 million won?

425
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:03,218
That little thing was
apparently over 100 years old

426
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,928
and valued at over 100 million.

427
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:06,638
I was really shocked.

428
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:10,475
What would you have done
if I ate that precious thing?

429
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,311
That's why I wanted you to have it.

430
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:16,147
Goodness, home-cooked meals
are better than wild ginseng.

431
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,775
I'm perfectly healthy,
so don't worry about me.

432
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,568
And this.

433
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,655
I saved up some money to give to you

434
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:26,199
for when you found something
you really wanted to do.

435
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:27,575
It's not much.

436
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:31,579
Gosh, this is too much.

437
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,417
I saved up money too, Grandma.

438
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:39,879
Don't let money stop you
from doing whatever you want.

439
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,798
If it's a hotel,

440
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:44,300
it should look pretty
no matter how small it is.

441
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,139
No matter what hotel you run,

442
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,392
make something that resembles you.

443
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:58,022
Then it'll be
the prettiest hotel in this world.

444
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,738
-Thank you, Grandma.
-Sure.

445
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,825
My precious girl.

446
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:13,955
Thank you for letting me
do my part as your grandmother.

447
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:32,473
All right.

448
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:11,471
SUITE

449
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,017
OFFICE

450
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:32,408
You're going to the US tomorrow?

451
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:33,660
He has an early flight.

452
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:37,413
Why don't you come back and live here?

453
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,374
It's okay, Grandpa.

454
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,335
I want to go back to school
and see my friends too.

455
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:43,628
Really?

456
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:47,215
I thought you'd prefer living here
with Mom and Grandpa.

457
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:50,468
That sounds great,
but I should go back to where I should be.

458
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,932
You're not old enough
to be acting so grown up.

459
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:57,392
You've matured too early.

460
00:32:58,518 --> 00:32:59,602
I'm sad to see you go.

461
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:00,687
I'll be back.

462
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:04,232
Okay. Let's eat.

463
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,167
Ji-hu.

464
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,420
If you want to stay, you can stay longer.

465
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,463
If you don't want to go, don't.

466
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:29,924
No, I want to go now.

467
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:34,387
Why the sudden change of heart?

468
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:40,935
Please say goodbye to Sa-rang for me.

469
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,104
Let's fly kites again next time,
Uncle Won.

470
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:47,942
Okay.

471
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:51,237
Let's hang out again
the next time you visit.

472
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,363
Okay.

473
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,004
We need to talk.

474
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,007
Talk.

475
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,009
Don't let Ji-hu…

476
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,012
live like we did.

477
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,433
Don't say "we."

478
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,019
It makes us sound like family.

479
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,606
You already know

480
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,902
Ji-hu is going back to the US for you.

481
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,363
He thinks that if he stays,
he'll only be a nuisance.

482
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,324
That small kid

483
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,993
is trying so hard to protect
someone dear to him.

484
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:41,829
As the adults,

485
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:45,333
we need to do our part.

486
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:47,877
I…

487
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,421
have a favor to ask of you.

488
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,799
Sure, anything.

489
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,514
Don't get smart with me.

490
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:01,849
Let me ask you one too.

491
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:02,767
Don't.

492
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,602
Don't live such a lonely life anymore.

493
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:29,335
I'll escort him safely, Ms. Gu.

494
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:32,880
I'll go now.

495
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:34,841
Take care.

496
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:38,052
Have a safe trip.

497
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:57,738
I love you

498
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:00,449
so, so much.

499
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:03,828
I'll see you again.

500
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,652
Mom.

501
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,404
Where are we going?

502
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:42,074
We're going home.

503
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,368
-Home?
-Yes.

504
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:45,494
Let's go.

505
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:23,658
Thank you for coming.

506
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:24,909
Let us begin.

507
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,410
You just took over King Hotel,

508
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:29,789
yet you're already about to open
hotel chains in 16 different countries.

509
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:32,625
What gave you that push
to turn your domestic hotel

510
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,293
into a global chain?

511
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:41,467
I looked back
on the past 100 years of King Hotel.

512
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:44,595
There were times
when we were desperate to survive.

513
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,723
At other times,
we were drunk on our success.

514
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:50,601
Over those years,

515
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:53,521
only one thing remained constant.

516
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,857
It was the heart of those
who took care of this hotel.

517
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,610
Such people kept our hotel together.

518
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:03,155
I only stood on the shoulder of that giant

519
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,825
to look out at the world.

520
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:08,869
You've moved on from a local hotel
to become a global chain.

521
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,913
What are your next steps?

522
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:12,873
We'll make our way to Europe,

523
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,001
where many chains have failed.

524
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:18,254
You're going to see new, innovative hotels

525
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:20,298
previously unseen from existing chains.

526
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,550
Your management style
is rather aggressive.

527
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,303
Is it your goal to make King Hotel
the best in the world?

528
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:44,405
On the day I was appointed
as the head manager,

529
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,365
I said,

530
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:51,620
"I'll make King Hotel
a place without fake smiles."

531
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:56,250
I used to think
most people's smiles were fake.

532
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:59,920
However, I met someone
who could smile with all her heart,

533
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:05,468
and I came to realize
how beautiful a smile could be.

534
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:09,889
King Hotel's goal
isn't to be the best in the world.

535
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:13,517
It's to become a hotel
where everyone can smile from their heart.

536
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,103
That

537
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:19,148
is the goal of King Hotel.

538
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,407
GUIDE TO HOTEL AMOR

539
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:01,482
Where love begins. Hotel Amor.

540
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,984
We'll open for reservations tonight.

541
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:09,865
All done.

542
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:30,886
Everything's ready.

543
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,817
I just finished getting ready to open.

544
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,445
I miss you so much.

545
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:01,500
He must be busy.

546
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,089
I need a nap.

547
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:09,091
I'm so tired.

548
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:11,552
Just for a moment.

549
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,078
You'll be there alone.

550
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,121
For emergencies.

551
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:18,118
-Have you been well?
-Yes.

552
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,495
What's going on?

553
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:22,540
I missed you so much.
It's wonderful to see you here.

554
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:24,625
I missed you too, so I ran over.

555
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:27,795
What's all this?

556
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,547
They're so pretty!

557
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,090
I'm glad you like them.

558
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:32,675
I wanted to give these to you.

559
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:36,428
Thank you.
Did you do this all by yourself?

560
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:58,409
You have such great taste.

561
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,412
I guess you know your stuff.

562
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:04,915
Do you want to sell this hotel?
I'd like to buy it out.

563
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:08,836
This is a five-S hotel,
so it's quite expensive.

564
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:13,090
I've heard of five-star hotels,

565
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:15,551
but never a five-S hotel.

566
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,095
Five smiles.

567
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:21,640
That's why it's a five-smile hotel.

568
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,939
"Where love begins."

569
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,775
-Hence, Hotel Amor?
-Yes.

570
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:36,071
This is a wonderful place,
full of romance.

571
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:40,659
I remembered the bed and breakfast
we stayed at in Gapado.

572
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:45,414
We detested each other so much,

573
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:47,875
yet we were so close on that day.

574
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:53,589
In a way, that was the place
our journey began.

575
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:57,176
That's why

576
00:43:57,259 --> 00:44:01,180
I wanted to create a place
where love starts to bloom.

577
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:05,225
Are you talking about
the most luxurious hotel

578
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,853
and the best restaurant in Gapado?

579
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:08,979
Yes.

580
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:13,067
The Chinese bushclover wine was delicious.

581
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,276
I'm craving it.

582
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:19,073
I had fun riding a bike together.

583
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:20,824
I want to do it again.

584
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,368
We should go back.

585
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:23,952
-Should we?
-Yes.

586
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,704
Let's do that.

587
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:27,998
One second.

588
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,292
ONE RESERVATION CONFIRMED

589
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,003
It's a reservation!

590
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,880
Let me see. Really?

591
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:38,550
Hey, you got a reservation
as soon as you opened.

592
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:40,761
Ms. Cheon, how impressive.

593
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:43,180
Yes, that's me.

594
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:46,392
Only you could pull this off.

595
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:48,268
Congratulations.

596
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:50,813
Thanks.

597
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:55,943
It's pretty late. Shouldn't you go?

598
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,528
You have work tomorrow.

599
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:05,327
Just a little longer.

600
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:13,127
I mean,

601
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:16,380
if you leave too late,

602
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:19,508
you'll be sleepy and tired.

603
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:33,397
Do you want to spend the night?

604
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:59,399
It's even prettier in the morning.

605
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:15,582
Here.

606
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:46,530
One, two, three.

607
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:48,407
One, two, three.

608
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:56,456
Right, Sa-rang's hotel.

609
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,125
-Hotel Amor.
-Yes.

610
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:01,128
-I couldn't get a reservation again.
-Really?

611
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:03,422
I failed too.

612
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:06,466
The six of us said
we'd meet up over a month ago.

613
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:07,926
Right?

614
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:11,346
But I'm glad her hotel is fully booked.

615
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:15,058
I should go over and help her out soon.

616
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:19,229
Where are we going?

617
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:22,733
To meet Mom.

618
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:24,776
Mom?

619
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,570
Whose mom?

620
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:28,947
Who do you think?

621
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:34,286
You gave me a scarf
to give to my mom, remember?

622
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:36,538
Yes, I did.

623
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:38,332
Since that day,

624
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:40,542
she's been asking me to bring you over.

625
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:43,337
What? No, I can't.

626
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,547
I'm not dressed properly,
and my hair's a mess.

627
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:47,758
I need to fix my makeup too.

628
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:48,967
You already look great.

629
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:51,678
I'm not ready to meet her yet.

630
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:54,681
And I don't have a present.
I can't go empty-handed.

631
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:57,851
Anyway, I can't. Turn the car around.

632
00:48:57,934 --> 00:49:00,562
I'm not turning around.
We'll be there soon.

633
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:03,273
Gosh, you should have told me.

634
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:06,026
I didn't even bring my makeup bag.

635
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:24,002
Mom, Pyeong-hwa is here.

636
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:26,672
Say hi to her.

637
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:28,423
This is my mom.

638
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:45,399
Hello.

639
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,110
My name is Oh Pyeong-hwa.

640
00:49:58,662 --> 00:49:59,579
Mom,

641
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,039
she's my girlfriend.

642
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:03,458
What do you think?

643
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,085
Isn't she pretty?

644
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:08,463
Not only is she pretty,
but she also has a big heart.

645
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,110
We will be…

646
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:34,030
happy together for a long time.

647
00:50:36,032 --> 00:50:37,200
Please watch over us.

648
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:54,968
Let me know if you need anything.

649
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:56,720
-Okay, thank you.
-Sure.

650
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:07,022
I'm hungry.

651
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:14,070
When did you come?

652
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:15,155
Right now.

653
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:17,824
You must be hungry. Late-night snacks?

654
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:29,795
My gosh!

655
00:51:31,087 --> 00:51:32,631
-What?
-Move aside. It's dangerous.

656
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:34,174
-One.
-Two.

657
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:35,217
-Three.
-Three.

658
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:42,933
Why are you here again?

659
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:44,976
I was just passing by.

660
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,978
That makes no sense.

661
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:49,022
I saw the lights off as I passed by.

662
00:51:49,105 --> 00:51:50,065
Stop lying.

663
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:51,566
You should call me for help.

664
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:52,943
Aren't you tired?

665
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:54,736
I should get some rest.

666
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:04,120
I knew you would do this.

667
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:06,414
I said I'd throw out the food waste.

668
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:07,374
Give me.

669
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:09,918
These are recyclables.

670
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,504
-You're right.
-Why are you here again?

671
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:14,756
To take out the garbage. Where is it?

672
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,007
Over there?

673
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,844
Where? Outside?

674
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:20,387
-Outside.
-Here?

675
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,264
No, outside. Out there.

676
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:29,729
You were out of toilet paper last time.

677
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:33,900
-Toilet paper?
-Yes.

678
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:35,402
Toilet paper?

679
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:37,195
Toilet paper.

680
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,955
So there's the toilet paper.

681
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:48,707
Why do you have so much?

682
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:55,505
We need to talk.

683
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:02,637
Hey.

684
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:05,599
You're not close by.
You can't come visit me every day.

685
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:07,017
I'm not tired. I'm fine.

686
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,102
Have you looked at yourself in the mirror?

687
00:53:09,185 --> 00:53:10,520
Have you even seen your eyes?

688
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:15,025
Your dark circles
have reached your cheekbones.

689
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:16,484
My gosh.

690
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:20,322
Stop coming over.
I'll come to you when I'm free.

691
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:23,408
You're fully booked this month.
How can you manage alone?

692
00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:26,953
I already uploaded a job ad.

693
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:28,788
I'll find a part-timer. Don't worry.

694
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:32,959
A…

695
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:37,672
A part-timer?

696
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:40,926
Are you being serious?

697
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:44,220
I'm doing this
because I'm worried about you.

698
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:45,597
Promise me.

699
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:49,100
Promise that you won't come over
every single day.

700
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:51,144
You're busy enough already.

701
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:53,480
Now.

702
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:00,070
Fine.

703
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:02,614
I won't come.

704
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:05,283
Do you mean it? You promised.

705
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:07,869
Okay.

706
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:10,997
And this too.

707
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:16,628
Good.

708
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:28,556
Can you start right away?

709
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,266
May I work on weekdays?

710
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:34,980
I'm looking for someone
to work weekends right now.

711
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:37,023
I have to hang out on weekends.

712
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:42,278
I cover your food, lodging,
and transportation expenses.

713
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:43,571
Is it still too difficult?

714
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:45,031
Of course it is.

715
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:48,118
Isn't doing my job enough?
Why am I forced to smile?

716
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:55,041
Wouldn't our guests be happier
if you welcome them with a smile?

717
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,001
Well,

718
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:59,045
can I be in charge of the office
instead of cleaning and stuff?

719
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:18,523
I looked over your résumé.

720
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:22,902
Can you really work weekends
when you already have a full-time job?

721
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:27,115
I'm always free on weekends.

722
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:30,035
On top of that, I'm very fit,
so it won't be a problem.

723
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:32,579
And everyone has two jobs now.
I should work hard too.

724
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:36,458
The president of King Hotel
doesn't need two jobs.

725
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:37,751
You're busy as it is.

726
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:39,627
That's why I should work even harder.

727
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:44,132
I heard the president here
used to be the hotel's best talent.

728
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:47,469
I'd like to learn from you.
Please hire me.

729
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:50,138
No. Please leave.

730
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:51,890
Yes. Please take me.

731
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:00,315
In that case,

732
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:02,067
show me your smile.

733
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:06,905
Gosh.

734
00:56:06,988 --> 00:56:09,074
You aren't ready to smile wholeheartedly.

735
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:10,158
Disqualified!

736
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:12,410
One second. Give me another chance.

737
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:14,913
Let me try again.

738
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:21,669
Please

739
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:23,671
hire me.

740
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:32,639
Is that a real smile?

741
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:33,765
Yes.

742
00:56:33,848 --> 00:56:35,600
Not a fake one?

743
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:36,601
No.

744
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,440
You can start next week.

745
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:45,902
Thank you, Ms. Cheon. I'll do my best.

746
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:48,947
That's a given. You have to do well.

747
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:51,282
-Can you do that?
-Yes, I can!

748
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:53,118
Excellent.

749
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:54,619
That's all for the interview.

750
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:56,121
Come to work next week.

751
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:02,877
I still have to pass
the most important interview.

752
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:06,965
Sorry?

753
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:12,846
I want to be with you forever.

754
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:43,626
Will you marry me?

755
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:34,594
I love you.

756
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:37,096
I love you more.

757
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:06,501
Everything is ready. Come on out.

758
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:08,753
Okay. We're coming.

759
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:17,595
-Please have a seat.
-Okay.

760
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:19,514
She looks great.

761
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:22,892
You look so pretty, Grandma.

762
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:25,144
What is this?
I'm scared someone may see me.

763
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:27,105
No, you could compete in pageants.

764
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:28,106
What?

765
00:59:28,189 --> 00:59:30,608
Everyone does this now.
You're like a princess.

766
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:31,985
Goodness.

767
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:34,112
How can this old woman be a princess?

768
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:37,991
If you aren't the princess,
you must be the queen.

769
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:40,868
Your Majesty the Queen, happy birthday.

770
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:43,746
-Two, three.
-Two, three.

771
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:46,666
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

772
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:49,043
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

773
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:52,380
-Happy birthday, dear Grandma
-Happy birthday, dear Grandma

774
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:55,425
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

775
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:57,302
Blow them out.

776
00:59:57,385 --> 01:00:00,221
Okay. Come closer and do it with me.

777
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:01,347
Should we?

778
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:03,641
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

779
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:09,063
Goodness, this is embarrassing.

780
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:21,242
All right.

781
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:23,286
Let me try it first.

782
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:31,836
It's so good.

783
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:34,589
Of course. I made this.

784
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:37,508
Ma'am, please try some.

785
01:00:37,592 --> 01:00:41,721
So are you sure people can eat this?

786
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:44,974
Of course. What do you take me for?

787
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:46,934
I'm asking because I know you.

788
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:51,439
Let's see.

789
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:53,107
Here we go.

790
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:03,201
Perfectly seasoned.

791
01:01:04,285 --> 01:01:07,205
-Not so bad.
-I'm good at everything.

792
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:12,919
Did you make this too?

793
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:15,463
I bought that.

794
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:19,050
I knew it. This was the most delicious.

795
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:21,427
And picking up nice food
is also a great skill.

796
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:24,514
You always have a way with words.

797
01:01:24,597 --> 01:01:26,057
My gosh.

798
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:53,710
I'd like to tell you something.

799
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:56,003
Yes? What is it?

800
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:58,214
You're very serious.

801
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:00,550
Did you do something wrong?

802
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:05,054
We'd like to get married.

803
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:11,352
We'll always cherish each other
and live a happy life.

804
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:17,275
I think I'll always be happy with him.

805
01:02:20,361 --> 01:02:21,195
Yes.

806
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:23,531
So you should.

807
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:30,913
That's wonderful.

808
01:02:40,631 --> 01:02:42,008
Grandma, why are you crying?

809
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:52,852
We'll be happy.

810
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:54,979
Yes, you should be.

811
01:02:55,813 --> 01:02:57,231
Does he pass?

812
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:59,358
Yes, he does.

813
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:03,905
I do, right?

814
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:41,150
It's Uncle Won.

815
01:04:00,878 --> 01:04:02,713
You must be Ji-hu.

816
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:05,633
Yes, my name is Yoon Ji-hu.

817
01:04:06,884 --> 01:04:08,594
Who are you?

818
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:14,267
I'm Uncle Won's mom.

819
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:16,394
That makes you…

820
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:18,688
my grandma?

821
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:20,773
Are you my grandma?

822
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:24,443
You're very smart, just like your mom.

823
01:04:25,653 --> 01:04:26,571
May I…

824
01:04:28,322 --> 01:04:29,991
give you a hug?

825
01:04:30,074 --> 01:04:31,200
Yes.

826
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:50,928
You've raised him beautifully.

827
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:53,347
You did a great job.

828
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:31,594
Let's go and find your auntie.

829
01:05:32,511 --> 01:05:33,554
There she is.

830
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:35,890
-Cho-rong.
-Hello.

831
01:05:35,973 --> 01:05:38,392
-Hello.
-Hello.

832
01:05:39,393 --> 01:05:40,603
Yes, hello.

833
01:05:42,146 --> 01:05:44,357
Hello, you must be Cho-rong.

834
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:46,400
Is he your boyfriend?

835
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:48,194
-Yes.
-Gosh.

836
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:50,446
He's so cool, like a prince.

837
01:05:50,529 --> 01:05:51,447
You pass!

838
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:55,576
Goodness, thank you for giving me a pass.

839
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:57,411
Hello.

840
01:05:58,245 --> 01:05:59,956
You must be Cho-rong.

841
01:06:00,539 --> 01:06:02,333
It's a no for you. You don't pass.

842
01:06:02,416 --> 01:06:04,794
What's with the rejection?
Why don't I pass?

843
01:06:05,836 --> 01:06:07,046
You make funny jokes.

844
01:06:07,546 --> 01:06:08,589
-Hello.
-Hello.

845
01:06:09,715 --> 01:06:11,217
It's hot in here.

846
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:27,316
You look great.

847
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,568
I thought you wouldn't come.

848
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:36,033
Your mom told me a parent's job

849
01:06:36,951 --> 01:06:39,203
was to let his child live their own life.

850
01:06:40,204 --> 01:06:43,165
She said you should get to live
the life you want for yourself.

851
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:47,878
It's overdue, but congrats.

852
01:06:57,888 --> 01:07:00,266
I hope you live a very happy life.

853
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:03,686
I will.

854
01:07:20,786 --> 01:07:21,912
It's time.

855
01:07:22,621 --> 01:07:23,664
Let's go.

856
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:48,230
Our son has grown old enough
to get married.

857
01:07:49,273 --> 01:07:50,441
It sure hits you differently.

858
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:54,820
Stop acting friendly
as if nothing has happened.

859
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:02,828
Do you want to get a cup of tea
after the wedding?

860
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:08,876
And now,

861
01:08:08,959 --> 01:08:11,879
the dashing groom will enter.

862
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:15,132
Please welcome the groom!

863
01:08:38,572 --> 01:08:40,116
You look wonderful!

864
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:52,169
Next,

865
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:53,838
the woman of the hour,

866
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:55,714
the bride, will enter.

867
01:08:56,507 --> 01:08:59,218
Please welcome the bride.

868
01:09:50,811 --> 01:09:51,896
You're so pretty!

869
01:09:53,105 --> 01:09:54,190
You're beautiful!

870
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:45,616
Shall we go?

871
01:10:49,536 --> 01:10:50,663
Anywhere with you.

872
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:20,818
KING THE LAND

873
01:11:53,851 --> 01:11:57,354
EPILOGUE

874
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:04,486
-No?
-No.

875
01:12:16,081 --> 01:12:17,791
Right? White's a bit much.

876
01:12:18,917 --> 01:12:20,044
I thought so too.

877
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:30,846
-Should I go change?
-You should go change.

878
01:12:30,929 --> 01:12:32,056
I can't breathe.

879
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:55,412
You look great. Let's go with this one.

880
01:12:55,496 --> 01:12:56,622
Do you like this one?

881
01:12:56,705 --> 01:12:58,916
I liked everything,
but this one's the best.

882
01:13:00,834 --> 01:13:02,086
Shall we go now?

883
01:13:02,795 --> 01:13:03,879
Shall we?

884
01:13:03,962 --> 01:13:04,963
Yes.

885
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:06,048
Let's go home.

886
01:13:07,299 --> 01:13:09,218
People are watching.

887
01:13:09,301 --> 01:13:10,344
What people?

888
01:13:11,929 --> 01:13:12,971
Over there.

889
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:17,684
Who cares?

890
01:13:25,317 --> 01:13:30,322
