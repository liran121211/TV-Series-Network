1
00:00:48,589 --> 00:00:52,036
KING THE LAND

2
00:00:52,449 --> 00:00:54,062
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:54,143 --> 00:00:55,882
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

4
00:01:22,576 --> 00:01:24,537
{\an8}I finally got some freedom.

5
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,123
{\an8}We'll party like each day is a year,
so don't stop me.

6
00:01:27,707 --> 00:01:29,041
{\an8}Don't even sleep, okay?

7
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:30,584
{\an8}You're so thrilled.

8
00:01:30,668 --> 00:01:32,712
Are you that happy?
Don't you miss Cho-rong?

9
00:01:32,795 --> 00:01:35,256
Hey, she needs some time of her own too.

10
00:01:35,923 --> 00:01:37,883
- What's with you?
- "What's with you?"

11
00:01:37,967 --> 00:01:39,301
- "What's with you?"
- Excuse me.

12
00:01:39,385 --> 00:01:40,761
- Yes, sir?
- Yes, sir?

13
00:01:42,763 --> 00:01:45,182
You're never off the clock, are you?

14
00:01:45,266 --> 00:01:46,809
It's not you two. Sit down.

15
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,063
"Yes, sir?" was funny.

16
00:01:56,444 --> 00:01:57,486
I finally got it.

17
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,321
I've solved the mystery.

18
00:02:00,156 --> 00:02:01,198
What mystery?

19
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,245
I get why Mr. Gu said he was a manager
and not the head manager

20
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:08,539
because that could make
everyone uncomfortable.

21
00:02:08,622 --> 00:02:10,666
But why did he call me
a department manager,

22
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,543
not a senior manager or a manager?

23
00:02:14,378 --> 00:02:15,212
I wonder.

24
00:02:16,255 --> 00:02:18,382
That's because I'm already
a department manager

25
00:02:18,466 --> 00:02:19,759
in Mr. Gu's heart.

26
00:02:19,842 --> 00:02:22,053
So he wants me
to use this chance to get trained

27
00:02:22,136 --> 00:02:23,637
as the department manager.

28
00:02:26,474 --> 00:02:28,726
I don't think it was that profound.

29
00:02:28,809 --> 00:02:29,935
No, it was. Definitely.

30
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:31,437
- Do you really think so?
- Yes!

31
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,855
I don't think so.

32
00:02:34,357 --> 00:02:35,941
- Mr. Yoo?
- Yes?

33
00:02:36,525 --> 00:02:39,028
I think our tickets were switched.

34
00:02:39,111 --> 00:02:40,446
You're in business class.

35
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,535
Really? Me?

36
00:02:46,619 --> 00:02:49,246
Of course you should sit
in business class, Mr. Yoo.

37
00:02:50,331 --> 00:02:51,874
Mr. No, you've been well-trained.

38
00:02:51,957 --> 00:02:55,419
I'm glad I brought you up
to be considerate of your superior.

39
00:02:55,503 --> 00:02:56,545
Give him a hand.

40
00:02:57,546 --> 00:03:01,592
You should probably go quickly
before I change my mind.

41
00:03:03,928 --> 00:03:04,762
Thank you, sir.

42
00:03:05,721 --> 00:03:07,932
Don't you ever change.

43
00:03:09,016 --> 00:03:11,185
Wow, business class? Take your seat.

44
00:03:11,268 --> 00:03:12,812
I'm off to business class.

45
00:03:12,895 --> 00:03:14,105
Business, man.

46
00:03:19,485 --> 00:03:20,319
I'm here.

47
00:03:22,113 --> 00:03:22,947
What's going on?

48
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:26,283
What do you think?
I came back to reclaim my seat.

49
00:03:26,992 --> 00:03:29,161
My seat is always next to you, right?

50
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,665
You're in the right spot.

51
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,793
Are you not uncomfortable?

52
00:03:35,876 --> 00:03:36,877
Not at all.

53
00:03:40,631 --> 00:03:42,174
I'm completely at ease.

54
00:03:43,467 --> 00:03:44,301
What?

55
00:03:45,636 --> 00:03:47,471
Why won't this work? Is it out of order?

56
00:03:47,555 --> 00:03:49,598
No, that's as far as it goes.

57
00:03:50,182 --> 00:03:51,767
- It went down.
- It won't go lower.

58
00:03:51,851 --> 00:03:53,185
Excuse me, Mr. No.

59
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:54,270
Yes?

60
00:03:54,812 --> 00:03:55,980
Are you trying to start something?

61
00:03:56,063 --> 00:03:57,064
Start what?

62
00:03:57,982 --> 00:03:59,733
This.

63
00:03:59,817 --> 00:04:01,861
If you keep pushing back,
I'll kick your seat.

64
00:04:04,238 --> 00:04:05,531
I'll be careful.

65
00:04:13,414 --> 00:04:16,667
So why did you choose to switch seats
and be uncomfortable?

66
00:04:18,627 --> 00:04:20,796
I am choosing to be with you.

67
00:04:22,173 --> 00:04:23,215
It's nice, isn't it?

68
00:04:24,592 --> 00:04:25,593
Is it just me?

69
00:04:27,428 --> 00:04:28,429
No.

70
00:04:30,473 --> 00:04:31,515
Me too.

71
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,077
This is nice.

72
00:04:52,661 --> 00:04:53,662
This is nice.

73
00:05:04,131 --> 00:05:05,758
<i>Hello!</i>

74
00:05:10,471 --> 00:05:11,388
WE GO HARD!

75
00:05:33,285 --> 00:05:35,913
{\an8}(YOU'RE PRETTY)

76
00:06:33,053 --> 00:06:33,887
We're here.

77
00:06:39,643 --> 00:06:40,728
Please follow me.

78
00:06:42,354 --> 00:06:43,480
Hello.

79
00:06:43,564 --> 00:06:46,233
Of course, this is nice.

80
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,068
I can't believe this.

81
00:06:48,694 --> 00:06:49,611
- My gosh.
- Careful.

82
00:06:49,695 --> 00:06:50,654
Watch the stairs.

83
00:06:56,327 --> 00:06:57,870
What is this?

84
00:06:58,454 --> 00:06:59,580
- My gosh.
- What's this?

85
00:07:01,999 --> 00:07:02,958
No way.

86
00:07:11,717 --> 00:07:12,885
This isn't the end.

87
00:07:12,968 --> 00:07:14,053
Follow me.

88
00:07:14,845 --> 00:07:16,680
- Really?
- There's more.

89
00:07:37,826 --> 00:07:39,328
Let's take pictures.

90
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,789
- One, two, three.
- Ta-da!

91
00:07:41,872 --> 00:07:43,832
- You come too.
- You two look awesome.

92
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,085
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

93
00:07:47,378 --> 00:07:50,297
The pool is a bit small.

94
00:07:51,423 --> 00:07:53,425
How is this small? It's wonderful.

95
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:55,928
Yes, why can't you be content?

96
00:07:56,011 --> 00:07:58,514
Mr. Yoo, this place is awesome!

97
00:07:58,597 --> 00:07:59,473
Mr. Yoo,

98
00:07:59,556 --> 00:08:00,766
thank you.

99
00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:02,601
Don't mention it. It's not a big deal.

100
00:08:03,435 --> 00:08:05,938
Let's go upstairs. It'll be even better.

101
00:08:06,021 --> 00:08:07,773
- My gosh. Upstairs?
- Another floor?

102
00:08:07,856 --> 00:08:08,774
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

103
00:08:08,857 --> 00:08:10,359
- Second floor!
- Let's go!

104
00:08:10,442 --> 00:08:12,069
What's on the second floor?

105
00:08:12,152 --> 00:08:13,237
Come quickly!

106
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,488
Second floor!

107
00:08:19,284 --> 00:08:21,161
- No Sang-sik.
- What's on the second floor?

108
00:08:21,245 --> 00:08:22,162
Goodness.

109
00:08:23,539 --> 00:08:26,041
These are the rooms.
Your rooms are to the right.

110
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,167
The right?

111
00:08:27,251 --> 00:08:28,711
- Yes.
- This is it?

112
00:08:28,794 --> 00:08:30,713
- This?
- This is our room.

113
00:08:30,796 --> 00:08:32,339
- What's it like?
- This?

114
00:08:35,843 --> 00:08:37,010
Three, two, one.

115
00:08:37,678 --> 00:08:39,471
There it is. There's the scream.

116
00:08:41,557 --> 00:08:42,474
It's so high!

117
00:08:43,142 --> 00:08:44,268
Where's my room?

118
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,355
Let's go inside, Mr. No.

119
00:08:51,233 --> 00:08:52,276
You little…

120
00:08:54,361 --> 00:08:56,113
What's all this?

121
00:08:57,656 --> 00:09:00,784
Why did you book only two rooms
for all these people?

122
00:09:00,868 --> 00:09:02,077
Two is more than enough.

123
00:09:02,161 --> 00:09:04,079
One room for men, one for women.

124
00:09:06,165 --> 00:09:08,292
- Where are you going to sleep?
- Me?

125
00:09:08,876 --> 00:09:10,210
Of course,

126
00:09:11,295 --> 00:09:12,337
I'll sleep here.

127
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,561
Are you saying

128
00:09:28,562 --> 00:09:30,689
this ridiculously absurd bed

129
00:09:31,315 --> 00:09:34,443
is supposed to be shared by you and me?

130
00:09:34,526 --> 00:09:36,487
Everything about this place is so nice.

131
00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:38,238
Gosh, so comfy.

132
00:09:38,322 --> 00:09:39,448
Lie down next to me.

133
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,158
You idiot.

134
00:09:41,241 --> 00:09:42,618
We're staying somewhere else.

135
00:09:43,368 --> 00:09:45,204
We can't. We already paid in full.

136
00:09:45,287 --> 00:09:46,955
Five people, five rooms.

137
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:48,081
That's a given.

138
00:09:48,165 --> 00:09:50,334
And let me make myself clear.

139
00:09:50,417 --> 00:09:52,461
I will not share a bed with you,

140
00:09:52,544 --> 00:09:56,381
so either book a new hotel
or pack up and go back to Korea.

141
00:09:56,965 --> 00:09:57,800
Got it?

142
00:10:00,969 --> 00:10:02,387
Mr. Yoo!

143
00:10:15,317 --> 00:10:16,235
Remember.

144
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,073
I'm the head manager.

145
00:10:22,574 --> 00:10:23,659
Okay?

146
00:10:24,576 --> 00:10:25,619
Yes, sir.

147
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:35,546
WE GO HARD!

148
00:10:37,047 --> 00:10:38,799
- Help!
- Don't do it.

149
00:10:38,882 --> 00:10:39,716
Stop it.

150
00:10:43,595 --> 00:10:44,847
Mr. Yoo!

151
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:47,391
- This place is wonderful.
- Thank you.

152
00:10:47,474 --> 00:10:50,269
How did you find such a great place?

153
00:10:50,352 --> 00:10:52,688
You have such great taste.

154
00:10:52,771 --> 00:10:54,898
We love it. It's the best!

155
00:10:56,024 --> 00:10:57,776
I think so too.

156
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,029
However, there has been a problem.

157
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:02,406
What problem?

158
00:11:02,489 --> 00:11:03,949
The problem is that…

159
00:11:04,032 --> 00:11:05,242
Well, the…

160
00:11:06,076 --> 00:11:07,911
Everyone loves it here.

161
00:11:08,495 --> 00:11:11,039
What do you mean there's a problem?

162
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,334
- May we really stay?
- Yes.

163
00:11:14,418 --> 00:11:15,377
- Really?
- Yes.

164
00:11:16,962 --> 00:11:19,006
The problem is resolved.

165
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:21,008
Luckily the rooster has stopped crowing.

166
00:11:21,592 --> 00:11:23,385
Then get in here, you two!

167
00:11:23,468 --> 00:11:25,012
It's so cool in here!

168
00:11:25,095 --> 00:11:26,013
Shall we? Okay.

169
00:11:26,096 --> 00:11:27,514
- Shoes off.
- I'm fine.

170
00:11:27,598 --> 00:11:29,474
Come on in. Let's all play together.

171
00:11:29,558 --> 00:11:31,435
Please enjoy. I'll join next time.

172
00:11:31,518 --> 00:11:32,519
Next time, my foot.

173
00:11:39,985 --> 00:11:40,902
You look great.

174
00:12:05,385 --> 00:12:07,971
EPISODE 10

175
00:12:08,055 --> 00:12:09,640
Did you have fun in the pool?

176
00:12:09,723 --> 00:12:10,641
- Yes!
- Yes!

177
00:12:10,724 --> 00:12:12,142
I'm glad.

178
00:12:14,353 --> 00:12:16,897
Let me tell you about today's schedule.

179
00:12:17,522 --> 00:12:19,316
<i>Let's find a chance to slip out later.</i>

180
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:23,612
We'll go to the hottest night market
here in Bangkok.

181
00:12:23,695 --> 00:12:26,073
<i>But we're here as a group.
Can we really do that?</i>

182
00:12:26,156 --> 00:12:27,491
<i>Of course we can.</i>

183
00:12:27,574 --> 00:12:29,368
<i>Vacations are all about freedom.</i>

184
00:12:31,787 --> 00:12:33,163
<i>Where are we going?</i>

185
00:12:34,206 --> 00:12:35,832
<i>You'll see when we get there.</i>

186
00:12:37,626 --> 00:12:38,543
Mr. No?

187
00:12:39,544 --> 00:12:42,130
Mr. Yoo is talking. Phone down.

188
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:48,053
Continue, Mr. Yoo.

189
00:12:48,136 --> 00:12:51,306
Things may become dangerous,
so I prepared something.

190
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,725
What did I prepare?

191
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:55,769
Group tour T-shirts!

192
00:12:56,269 --> 00:12:57,979
Amazing.

193
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,191
But we all have our own tastes.

194
00:13:01,942 --> 00:13:03,235
We don't need a group--

195
00:13:03,318 --> 00:13:04,611
Thank you, Mr. Yoo.

196
00:13:04,695 --> 00:13:05,946
We'll wear them well.

197
00:13:06,446 --> 00:13:07,489
Here.

198
00:13:07,572 --> 00:13:10,450
Let's get changed,
and we'll meet back here in 30 minutes.

199
00:13:10,534 --> 00:13:11,535
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

200
00:13:13,412 --> 00:13:14,579
Mr. No.

201
00:13:14,663 --> 00:13:15,956
Let's go.

202
00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:20,502
Where are we going?

203
00:13:20,585 --> 00:13:21,503
I'll tell you later.

204
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:23,547
Go get changed.

205
00:13:30,711 --> 00:13:33,256
This is wonderful.

206
00:13:33,798 --> 00:13:36,217
Ms. Gang, what's the theme
of our trip again?

207
00:13:38,344 --> 00:13:39,345
We go hard!

208
00:13:39,428 --> 00:13:40,680
Precisely! We go hard!

209
00:13:40,763 --> 00:13:43,307
Go hard for our teamwork!

210
00:13:43,391 --> 00:13:45,685
Go hard for our company!

211
00:13:45,768 --> 00:13:46,811
We go hard.

212
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,940
As you already know,

213
00:13:51,023 --> 00:13:51,983
it's not "Hard go."

214
00:13:52,066 --> 00:13:54,110
People may see it
and think we're not soft.

215
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:57,488
That was so funny.

216
00:13:57,572 --> 00:13:58,781
Get it? Not soft?

217
00:14:01,742 --> 00:14:04,036
So we'll stay as "Go hard."

218
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,288
- Okay?
- Yes!

219
00:14:05,371 --> 00:14:08,791
Then Ms. Gang will start our chant,
and we'll all shout it out together.

220
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,085
- Go.
- Hard.

221
00:14:11,669 --> 00:14:13,421
- Go.
- Hard.

222
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,932
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

223
00:14:25,725 --> 00:14:29,270
Go hard!

224
00:14:29,353 --> 00:14:31,063
- Go hard!
- Go hard!

225
00:14:31,147 --> 00:14:32,982
- Go hard!
- Go hard!

226
00:14:46,704 --> 00:14:48,831
Why do we have to eat Vietnamese noodles

227
00:14:48,915 --> 00:14:50,833
after coming all the way to Thailand?

228
00:14:50,917 --> 00:14:53,169
We don't complain
when we eat Chinese in Korea.

229
00:14:54,086 --> 00:14:57,298
But still, there must be
many good Thai noodle restaurants.

230
00:14:57,965 --> 00:15:00,468
I have a go-to place
whenever I come here on a flight.

231
00:15:00,551 --> 00:15:01,594
Why don't we go there?

232
00:15:01,677 --> 00:15:03,638
Yes, Pyeong-hwa knows Bangkok really well.

233
00:15:03,721 --> 00:15:05,181
Let's go to her joint.

234
00:15:05,264 --> 00:15:07,183
No, this is a great restaurant.

235
00:15:07,266 --> 00:15:08,226
Take a look.

236
00:15:10,811 --> 00:15:12,021
Trust me and try it.

237
00:15:12,104 --> 00:15:13,814
I'm a Thailand expert.

238
00:15:13,898 --> 00:15:14,815
Please come inside.

239
00:15:19,445 --> 00:15:20,279
We are…

240
00:15:21,072 --> 00:15:21,989
- One.
- One.

241
00:15:22,073 --> 00:15:23,324
That was too weak.

242
00:15:23,407 --> 00:15:24,242
We are…

243
00:15:24,325 --> 00:15:26,160
- One!
- One!

244
00:15:32,792 --> 00:15:34,126
I really don't like him.

245
00:15:36,254 --> 00:15:37,922
These are all noodles.

246
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:39,966
Of course. This is a noodle restaurant.

247
00:15:40,549 --> 00:15:42,635
Da-eul doesn't like noodles.

248
00:15:42,718 --> 00:15:45,638
What are you talking about?
I love noodles.

249
00:15:46,138 --> 00:15:47,765
You do? Since when?

250
00:15:47,848 --> 00:15:50,434
I've been craving noodles
since I set foot in Bangkok.

251
00:15:51,644 --> 00:15:53,896
Ms. Gang and I are kind of hitting it off.

252
00:15:56,357 --> 00:15:58,609
If you visit Bangkok,
you must eat sticky noodles.

253
00:15:58,693 --> 00:15:59,777
What's that?

254
00:16:00,444 --> 00:16:01,487
The noodles are…

255
00:16:03,281 --> 00:16:04,657
really sticky.

256
00:16:06,867 --> 00:16:09,495
Oh, because they're sticky.

257
00:16:11,289 --> 00:16:12,540
Everything is great here,

258
00:16:12,623 --> 00:16:15,084
but number one is the best.

259
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:17,169
- I'll take number one.
- Okay.

260
00:16:17,253 --> 00:16:18,587
- Me too.
- Okay.

261
00:16:18,671 --> 00:16:19,797
Me too.

262
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,966
What about you, Mr. No?

263
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:24,802
It's a hot day.
Do we have to eat hot noodles?

264
00:16:24,885 --> 00:16:26,971
I'll just have a glass of beer.

265
00:16:27,054 --> 00:16:28,514
Okay. Excuse me!

266
00:16:30,933 --> 00:16:32,810
We'll order five number ones.

267
00:16:34,437 --> 00:16:36,147
I said I wasn't eating.

268
00:16:36,647 --> 00:16:38,107
I'm having two portions.

269
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:39,817
Do you speak Thai too?

270
00:16:40,651 --> 00:16:41,569
Yes.

271
00:16:42,862 --> 00:16:43,946
Go hard!

272
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,614
- Go hard!
- Go hard!

273
00:16:50,828 --> 00:16:51,871
That just hit the spot.

274
00:16:51,954 --> 00:16:53,581
This is it.

275
00:17:04,925 --> 00:17:05,801
This is so good.

276
00:17:06,886 --> 00:17:08,971
This is much better than my joint.

277
00:17:09,555 --> 00:17:10,639
What a bummer.

278
00:17:10,723 --> 00:17:12,683
This would be perfect with soju.

279
00:17:12,767 --> 00:17:15,644
No, this would be perfect
for curing a hangover the next day.

280
00:17:15,728 --> 00:17:17,313
Try the soup. It's insane.

281
00:17:17,813 --> 00:17:19,273
I told you so.

282
00:17:19,357 --> 00:17:20,649
Just trust me and follow me.

283
00:17:20,733 --> 00:17:22,485
Mr. Yoo, you're the best.

284
00:17:22,568 --> 00:17:25,154
It may be good, but it's just noodles.

285
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:27,198
Mr. Gu…

286
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,617
Mr. No, try a bite.

287
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,577
- I'm fine.
- Just try a bite.

288
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,953
- I'm fine.
- Just once.

289
00:17:33,037 --> 00:17:34,246
Just one bite.

290
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,290
- I'm fine.
- One bite. Please?

291
00:17:39,168 --> 00:17:40,211
Good grief.

292
00:17:49,887 --> 00:17:51,180
What just happened?

293
00:17:51,263 --> 00:17:53,015
- Why is this so good?
- What?

294
00:17:53,099 --> 00:17:54,517
You just fed Mr. No.

295
00:17:55,351 --> 00:17:57,228
I did? When?

296
00:17:57,311 --> 00:17:58,270
You did.

297
00:18:00,022 --> 00:18:01,065
I did that?

298
00:18:01,148 --> 00:18:02,817
You did what? I didn't see it.

299
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,901
- Right?
- Right.

300
00:18:04,402 --> 00:18:06,404
- This is good.
- I was just sharing.

301
00:18:06,487 --> 00:18:07,947
This place is good.

302
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,240
- Give that to me.
- What?

303
00:18:09,323 --> 00:18:10,783
- It's good.
- That's mine.

304
00:18:11,409 --> 00:18:13,369
Excuse me! One more, please.

305
00:18:14,537 --> 00:18:15,788
This is great.

306
00:18:17,248 --> 00:18:18,624
What's that?

307
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:20,251
What?

308
00:18:20,835 --> 00:18:22,753
- Nothing's out there.
- Never mind.

309
00:18:22,837 --> 00:18:23,879
Eat up.

310
00:18:25,423 --> 00:18:27,091
- This is so good.
- It is.

311
00:18:30,928 --> 00:18:32,680
It's perfect with beer.

312
00:18:32,763 --> 00:18:34,473
- It's good.
- The dumplings are good.

313
00:18:38,853 --> 00:18:40,187
We're running out of time.

314
00:18:40,271 --> 00:18:42,481
Our next stop is
the hottest spot in Bangkok,

315
00:18:42,565 --> 00:18:44,900
filled with every product
and every kind of food.

316
00:18:45,526 --> 00:18:48,070
- A food heaven.
- We're going to eat more?

317
00:18:48,154 --> 00:18:49,363
I came to Thailand to eat.

318
00:18:49,447 --> 00:18:51,323
I'm so full. I can't eat anymore.

319
00:18:51,407 --> 00:18:53,534
If I eat more, I'm not even human.

320
00:18:53,617 --> 00:18:55,911
My diet completely fell through.

321
00:18:55,995 --> 00:18:57,746
I'm done eating as of right now.

322
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,206
Don't offer me anything.

323
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:01,542
We're running out of time.
Let's get moving.

324
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:04,336
Go hard! We are one!

325
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,421
Hurry up. Get moving.

326
00:19:05,504 --> 00:19:06,505
Mr. No.

327
00:19:07,047 --> 00:19:08,382
Pay the tab and come along.

328
00:19:14,597 --> 00:19:15,973
- Shall we?
- Okay.

329
00:19:41,373 --> 00:19:43,334
What's that? That looks good!

330
00:19:57,223 --> 00:19:58,182
Mr. Exclamation Mark.

331
00:19:58,265 --> 00:19:59,350
Go back.

332
00:20:05,731 --> 00:20:07,191
I didn't do this.

333
00:20:11,904 --> 00:20:12,863
What's that?

334
00:20:12,947 --> 00:20:14,949
- That looks good, right?
- What's that?

335
00:20:15,032 --> 00:20:16,283
It's pad thai.

336
00:20:16,909 --> 00:20:17,910
Should we have some?

337
00:20:17,993 --> 00:20:19,954
Mr. Yoo! Buy some for us.

338
00:20:20,037 --> 00:20:21,080
- This?
- Yes.

339
00:20:21,163 --> 00:20:22,706
Mr. Yoo, I want shrimp pad thai.

340
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,749
That looks so good.

341
00:20:23,832 --> 00:20:25,042
Hey, it's ice cream!

342
00:20:31,298 --> 00:20:33,676
TAIWANESE-STYLE PEANUT ICE CREAM

343
00:20:34,385 --> 00:20:37,263
Do you have to eat
Taiwanese ice cream in Bangkok?

344
00:20:37,346 --> 00:20:40,140
I feel so lucky that
I get to eat peanut ice cream

345
00:20:40,224 --> 00:20:41,892
while I'm here in Bangkok.

346
00:20:41,976 --> 00:20:43,561
Thailand is a street food heaven.

347
00:20:49,984 --> 00:20:51,068
Is it that good?

348
00:20:51,151 --> 00:20:52,528
Totally. Do you want a bite?

349
00:20:52,611 --> 00:20:53,571
I'm fine.

350
00:20:53,654 --> 00:20:55,239
- Come on.
- No.

351
00:20:55,322 --> 00:20:58,909
Anyway, I clearly remember you saying
that you were too full.

352
00:20:59,493 --> 00:21:01,704
People visit Thailand for its food.

353
00:21:01,787 --> 00:21:03,414
I haven't even started.

354
00:21:03,497 --> 00:21:04,999
You said you were full.

355
00:21:05,082 --> 00:21:07,167
- That you'll blow up.
- This is dessert.

356
00:21:07,251 --> 00:21:08,586
- Is it a separate stomach?
- Mr. No!

357
00:21:09,628 --> 00:21:10,588
- He's back?
- Mr. No!

358
00:21:13,424 --> 00:21:14,508
Let's find a seat.

359
00:21:15,301 --> 00:21:16,135
Me?

360
00:21:16,218 --> 00:21:17,970
Yes, you.

361
00:21:21,223 --> 00:21:23,392
What's all this?

362
00:21:24,143 --> 00:21:26,353
We're in Thailand,
so we must try all its food.

363
00:21:26,937 --> 00:21:27,896
We just ate.

364
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,648
How are we going to eat all this,

365
00:21:29,732 --> 00:21:30,566
sir?

366
00:21:30,649 --> 00:21:31,817
We have a crowd.

367
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,444
A bite each won't be much.

368
00:21:33,527 --> 00:21:34,903
What should I begin with?

369
00:21:34,987 --> 00:21:37,364
You should start eating
instead of thinking.

370
00:21:37,448 --> 00:21:38,324
Right?

371
00:21:39,116 --> 00:21:40,117
Let's get started.

372
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,036
Thank you, Mr. Yoo.

373
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:43,746
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

374
00:21:43,829 --> 00:21:45,706
Right, before we eat, let's make a toast.

375
00:21:45,789 --> 00:21:46,999
Shall we? Sounds great.

376
00:21:47,082 --> 00:21:48,375
Okay. Go hard!

377
00:21:48,459 --> 00:21:50,502
- Go hard!
- Go hard!

378
00:21:56,008 --> 00:21:58,260
Ms. Gang, you've done well.

379
00:21:58,344 --> 00:21:59,762
Come on.

380
00:22:00,304 --> 00:22:02,348
- Thank you, sir.
- Good work.

381
00:22:02,431 --> 00:22:04,099
You too, Mr. Yoo.

382
00:22:04,683 --> 00:22:06,101
- Mr. Yoo.
- You can't reach this.

383
00:22:08,354 --> 00:22:09,438
Thank you.

384
00:22:10,397 --> 00:22:13,609
And Mr. No, you've done well too.

385
00:22:18,072 --> 00:22:19,114
Mr. Yoo.

386
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,605
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

387
00:23:38,444 --> 00:23:39,611
Do you want some?

388
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:56,837
- Encore!
- Encore!

389
00:24:02,634 --> 00:24:03,844
Is everything going okay?

390
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,806
Everything is going smoothly
thanks to you, Ms. Gu.

391
00:24:11,435 --> 00:24:12,436
Well…

392
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:15,856
You recently picked out
the best staff of each subsidiary

393
00:24:15,939 --> 00:24:18,025
and sent them on a trip, right?

394
00:24:18,108 --> 00:24:20,110
A trip? I haven't heard anything about it.

395
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:25,199
Mr. Gu Won took the best staff
of King Hotel, King Air, and King Fashion

396
00:24:25,282 --> 00:24:27,159
and took them on an incentive trip.

397
00:24:29,286 --> 00:24:31,288
- Mr. Choi.
- Yes?

398
00:24:31,371 --> 00:24:34,500
How could something in King Group
be carried out without my knowledge?

399
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,460
And of all things, incentives?

400
00:24:36,543 --> 00:24:38,837
I'm sorry, ma'am. I'll look into it.

401
00:25:14,873 --> 00:25:15,832
<i>Are you asleep?</i>

402
00:25:20,045 --> 00:25:21,380
<i>No, I'm not.</i>

403
00:25:22,214 --> 00:25:23,757
<i>Can we see each other?</i>

404
00:25:25,592 --> 00:25:26,552
<i>Now?</i>

405
00:25:34,393 --> 00:25:35,435
<i>Right now.</i>

406
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:36,562
<i>Okay.</i>

407
00:25:54,204 --> 00:25:56,873
Why are you so heavy?

408
00:26:06,174 --> 00:26:07,050
Sa-rang.

409
00:26:09,177 --> 00:26:11,054
Do we have beer at home?

410
00:26:12,681 --> 00:26:13,515
At home?

411
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:15,601
Yeah.

412
00:28:08,422 --> 00:28:09,589
You weren't asleep?

413
00:28:11,341 --> 00:28:12,342
I was waiting.

414
00:28:14,803 --> 00:28:15,846
Me too.

415
00:28:19,725 --> 00:28:22,185
I'm going to kill Mr. No when we get back.

416
00:28:22,269 --> 00:28:23,103
Why?

417
00:28:23,186 --> 00:28:24,938
He prepared a lot for this trip.

418
00:28:25,021 --> 00:28:27,774
That's the problem. It's way too much.

419
00:28:27,858 --> 00:28:29,818
"Go hard"? It's so tacky.

420
00:28:29,901 --> 00:28:31,653
Da-eul is awful too.

421
00:28:31,737 --> 00:28:33,530
"Mr. Exclamation Mark, go back."

422
00:28:34,156 --> 00:28:36,658
Don't get me started.
I'll see them in my sleep.

423
00:28:39,786 --> 00:28:42,998
I haven't been on a trip
with my friends since college.

424
00:28:44,249 --> 00:28:47,127
I've never gone abroad with my friends

425
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:49,588
or gone anywhere with my grandma.

426
00:28:50,505 --> 00:28:52,215
What have I been doing with my life?

427
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:59,598
You're here now.

428
00:29:01,266 --> 00:29:02,851
And we'll travel much more.

429
00:29:04,102 --> 00:29:05,103
It'll happen.

430
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,859
It's nice to be here with you.

431
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,821
It finally feels like a vacation.

432
00:29:14,905 --> 00:29:16,907
I thought we were in a boot camp.

433
00:29:19,785 --> 00:29:21,703
Tomorrow will be even better.

434
00:29:23,789 --> 00:29:27,459
I'll make every day of yours
filled with happiness.

435
00:29:30,921 --> 00:29:33,006
I'm more than happy right now.

436
00:29:49,898 --> 00:29:50,899
You coming in?

437
00:29:53,777 --> 00:29:54,820
Come on.

438
00:30:19,594 --> 00:30:20,720
I missed you.

439
00:30:22,514 --> 00:30:24,516
We were together all day long.

440
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,562
Not the back of your head.

441
00:30:28,645 --> 00:30:29,688
Your face.

442
00:30:32,524 --> 00:30:34,734
I missed this lovely face so much.

443
00:32:00,153 --> 00:32:02,113
Why is this so heavy?

444
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:11,790
PYEONG-HWA,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING THIS EVENING?

445
00:32:11,873 --> 00:32:12,749
Ro-un.

446
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,835
What are you doing after work?

447
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,295
Do you want to get dinner?

448
00:32:19,339 --> 00:32:20,382
I have plans.

449
00:32:21,132 --> 00:32:21,967
Really?

450
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:23,927
You have plans tonight?

451
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:24,970
Yes.

452
00:32:25,845 --> 00:32:26,888
Tonight.

453
00:32:44,406 --> 00:32:45,323
What's that sound?

454
00:33:02,173 --> 00:33:04,175
Good morning.

455
00:33:04,259 --> 00:33:06,761
Yes, Mr. Yoo. Good morning.

456
00:33:06,845 --> 00:33:09,055
Let me announce today's schedule.

457
00:33:09,139 --> 00:33:11,891
We'll begin our day
with a tour of the Wat Arun.

458
00:33:11,975 --> 00:33:13,560
We'll eat at choice restaurants

459
00:33:13,643 --> 00:33:17,397
and visit the icon of Bangkok,
ICONSIAM, for some shopping.

460
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,233
Then we'll end the day
with a party on a ferry boat.

461
00:33:20,317 --> 00:33:21,609
Do you understand?

462
00:33:22,444 --> 00:33:23,737
What about free time,

463
00:33:24,321 --> 00:33:25,155
sir?

464
00:33:25,238 --> 00:33:27,282
There's no free time on a group tour.

465
00:33:27,365 --> 00:33:28,283
No.

466
00:33:28,366 --> 00:33:30,410
What sort of a tour
doesn't have some free time?

467
00:33:30,493 --> 00:33:31,328
He's right.

468
00:33:31,411 --> 00:33:33,288
This is tyranny. How awful.

469
00:33:33,371 --> 00:33:35,957
No, you came on this trip
with your free will.

470
00:33:36,041 --> 00:33:37,459
You can't want that here.

471
00:33:40,295 --> 00:33:41,171
Right?

472
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,840
Get ready.
See you downstairs in 30 minutes.

473
00:33:44,424 --> 00:33:45,425
Yes, sir.

474
00:33:49,721 --> 00:33:50,805
See you.

475
00:34:00,774 --> 00:34:04,611
Go hard!

476
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:06,988
- That's so cool.
- It is.

477
00:34:07,572 --> 00:34:08,823
It's amazing.

478
00:34:15,747 --> 00:34:18,375
It's even more breathtaking in person.

479
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:20,460
This is the Wat Arun Temple.

480
00:34:20,543 --> 00:34:21,753
Let's go inside.

481
00:34:26,925 --> 00:34:28,051
Isn't it beautiful?

482
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:32,472
If you see any monks as we walk around…

483
00:34:47,987 --> 00:34:48,988
Mr. No.

484
00:34:50,573 --> 00:34:51,574
Go to the back.

485
00:34:53,201 --> 00:34:54,494
Why? I'm fine here.

486
00:34:54,577 --> 00:34:56,037
The order is off.

487
00:34:56,121 --> 00:34:58,498
When we play, we go hard!

488
00:34:58,581 --> 00:35:00,083
When we eat, we go hard!

489
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:01,709
Enough with "Go hard."

490
00:35:01,793 --> 00:35:03,753
We're not wearing those T-shirts today.

491
00:35:03,837 --> 00:35:06,840
We may not have the T-shirts on,
but we'll go hard forever.

492
00:35:06,923 --> 00:35:09,592
You're forever an exclamation mark.
Return to your spot.

493
00:35:16,391 --> 00:35:17,642
Mr. Exclamation Mark.

494
00:35:17,725 --> 00:35:19,352
Why aren't you in your spot?

495
00:35:21,771 --> 00:35:22,605
Let's go.

496
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,274
Let's go.

497
00:35:24,357 --> 00:35:25,650
Do we really have to…

498
00:35:26,651 --> 00:35:29,154
stay in this formation as we walk?

499
00:35:29,237 --> 00:35:31,322
Mr. No, how long have you been working?

500
00:35:37,704 --> 00:35:38,746
Six years?

501
00:35:39,664 --> 00:35:40,540
Six months.

502
00:35:42,792 --> 00:35:44,878
Let me share a word as your senior.

503
00:35:44,961 --> 00:35:47,672
Don't get on Mr. Yoo's nerves.
It'll make our lives harder.

504
00:35:47,755 --> 00:35:49,591
Da-eul, I thought you were on our side.

505
00:35:49,674 --> 00:35:52,552
It's because we're a team.
I couldn't care less about strangers.

506
00:35:52,635 --> 00:35:53,761
Exclamation Mark, to the back.

507
00:35:54,429 --> 00:35:55,680
Wait for me!

508
00:35:55,763 --> 00:35:56,639
Come on.

509
00:35:56,723 --> 00:35:58,766
- The three of us.
- Take a picture, please.

510
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,727
I'll take it now. Over here.

511
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:02,645
One, two, three.

512
00:36:02,729 --> 00:36:03,938
Go hard.

513
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:06,816
Mr. No, do you want one?

514
00:36:07,692 --> 00:36:08,693
Sure.

515
00:36:10,278 --> 00:36:11,738
I'll take it for you.

516
00:36:11,821 --> 00:36:12,947
Will you really?

517
00:36:13,031 --> 00:36:15,074
- Come here. Take it with us.
- Really?

518
00:36:15,158 --> 00:36:16,075
- Go hard!
- Go hard!

519
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:17,285
- Go hard!
- Go hard!

520
00:36:17,368 --> 00:36:18,912
One more time. Go hard.

521
00:36:18,995 --> 00:36:20,455
- Go hard!
- Go hard!

522
00:36:34,802 --> 00:36:35,637
Go hard!

523
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,733
- Go hard!
- Go hard!

524
00:36:49,776 --> 00:36:50,652
- Go hard!
- Go hard!

525
00:36:54,614 --> 00:36:56,282
- Go hard!
- Go hard!

526
00:36:56,366 --> 00:36:58,201
- Go hard!
- Go hard!

527
00:36:59,536 --> 00:37:00,370
Go hard!

528
00:37:01,037 --> 00:37:03,665
- Go hard!
- Go hard!

529
00:37:03,748 --> 00:37:05,458
Not this way. This way.

530
00:37:05,542 --> 00:37:07,835
- No, this way.
- Come on, Mr. Yoo.

531
00:37:07,919 --> 00:37:09,462
- Just a little more.
- Here.

532
00:37:09,546 --> 00:37:11,172
Let's do it here. This is perfect.

533
00:37:12,423 --> 00:37:13,508
Go hard!

534
00:37:13,591 --> 00:37:14,968
- Go hard!
- Go hard!

535
00:37:29,399 --> 00:37:31,025
Now the highlight of the day.

536
00:37:31,109 --> 00:37:33,820
I welcome you
to a dinner party on a ferry boat!

537
00:37:34,404 --> 00:37:35,780
This is amazing.

538
00:37:35,863 --> 00:37:38,283
I always wanted to try this
whenever I was in Bangkok.

539
00:37:38,366 --> 00:37:40,034
Mr. Yoo, you're awesome!

540
00:37:41,744 --> 00:37:42,787
Let's get out of here.

541
00:37:43,454 --> 00:37:45,373
- Now?
- In a moment.

542
00:37:46,332 --> 00:37:47,584
Is that possible?

543
00:37:48,167 --> 00:37:49,294
Just follow my lead.

544
00:37:49,377 --> 00:37:51,254
Now go inside.

545
00:37:56,968 --> 00:37:57,927
Now.

546
00:38:33,671 --> 00:38:34,505
What the heck?

547
00:38:37,258 --> 00:38:38,259
Why are you here?

548
00:38:38,343 --> 00:38:40,219
Why are you asking me?

549
00:38:40,803 --> 00:38:42,513
Do you have something to say?

550
00:38:44,307 --> 00:38:45,391
Darn it.

551
00:38:45,475 --> 00:38:46,476
No!

552
00:38:48,061 --> 00:38:48,936
I mean…

553
00:38:53,107 --> 00:38:54,776
We have to line up again.

554
00:38:55,735 --> 00:38:58,029
If you didn't like the ferry,
you could've said so.

555
00:39:28,309 --> 00:39:29,143
Here.

556
00:39:29,727 --> 00:39:31,312
Have a cool drink.

557
00:39:32,438 --> 00:39:33,439
Thanks.

558
00:39:34,774 --> 00:39:36,192
Are you still upset?

559
00:39:36,734 --> 00:39:39,404
I was such an idiot. What am I doing?

560
00:39:40,613 --> 00:39:44,075
Mr. No suddenly came between us.
What are the chances?

561
00:39:44,784 --> 00:39:46,452
He's ruining everything.

562
00:39:50,498 --> 00:39:51,791
But you were so cool.

563
00:39:58,423 --> 00:39:59,674
Mr. No, where are you?

564
00:40:00,717 --> 00:40:01,843
Mr. No!

565
00:40:02,927 --> 00:40:04,011
There you are.

566
00:40:08,433 --> 00:40:09,517
Come quickly.

567
00:40:14,355 --> 00:40:16,607
Thailand looks so beautiful at night.

568
00:40:16,691 --> 00:40:17,984
I feel so at peace too.

569
00:40:18,735 --> 00:40:21,529
Everyone here looks so bright and relaxed.

570
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,782
There's this word in Thai. <i>Sabai</i>.

571
00:40:24,866 --> 00:40:27,827
Instead of always rushing things
and scrambling around,

572
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:30,496
it tells you to slow down
and relax a little.

573
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,539
<i>Sabai</i>.

574
00:40:31,622 --> 00:40:32,957
Maybe that's why.

575
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,293
<i>Sabai</i>.

576
00:40:35,376 --> 00:40:36,502
That's nice.

577
00:40:36,586 --> 00:40:39,130
But if we went <i>sabai</i> with our sales,
we'd get fired.

578
00:40:40,298 --> 00:40:44,302
If we went <i>sabai</i> on a flight,
we wouldn't finish our service on time.

579
00:40:44,385 --> 00:40:45,928
Hey, the same goes for the hotel.

580
00:40:46,512 --> 00:40:48,931
What a foreign concept for us, right?

581
00:40:50,933 --> 00:40:52,602
Then why don't we

582
00:40:52,685 --> 00:40:56,856
enjoy some free time tomorrow
while we're in Bangkok?

583
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:59,400
Free time for everyone.

584
00:41:00,902 --> 00:41:03,154
<i>Sabai</i>.

585
00:41:03,946 --> 00:41:06,240
<i>Sabai</i>.

586
00:41:06,324 --> 00:41:07,200
Bye-bye.

587
00:41:08,034 --> 00:41:11,287
We're going hard
until the end of this trip.

588
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:12,747
If you want to relax,

589
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:15,124
you can go home and do it on your own.

590
00:41:15,208 --> 00:41:19,086
By any chance, if you wish to go home now,

591
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:21,547
then feel free to go home and relax.

592
00:41:21,631 --> 00:41:22,840
This is so much fun.

593
00:41:22,924 --> 00:41:24,383
It's so much fun.

594
00:41:26,093 --> 00:41:28,596
Ro-un, what brings you here?

595
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,973
I stopped by in passing.

596
00:41:32,183 --> 00:41:33,100
Hello.

597
00:41:33,768 --> 00:41:34,936
- My name is Lee Ro-un.
- Who is that?

598
00:41:35,019 --> 00:41:36,562
-I had time after a flight here,
-Her junior.

599
00:41:36,646 --> 00:41:38,189
so I stopped by to see Pyeong-hwa.

600
00:41:38,981 --> 00:41:40,274
Nice to meet you.

601
00:41:41,526 --> 00:41:42,985
He's a junior on my crew.

602
00:41:44,737 --> 00:41:46,197
How did you come here?

603
00:41:46,989 --> 00:41:50,701
I asked what you'd be doing later,
and you said you'd be eating here.

604
00:41:50,785 --> 00:41:51,661
It's not that.

605
00:41:51,744 --> 00:41:54,288
Mr. Yoo, can he join us?

606
00:41:54,372 --> 00:41:56,165
Wait, he's too good-looking.

607
00:41:56,249 --> 00:41:57,542
We kind of overlap.

608
00:41:57,625 --> 00:41:59,252
Then you should meet him.

609
00:41:59,335 --> 00:42:02,505
This is Department Manager Yoo Sang-sik
of King Group Headquarters.

610
00:42:02,588 --> 00:42:04,048
And this is Manager No.

611
00:42:04,674 --> 00:42:06,968
This is Cheon Sa-rang of King Hotel.

612
00:42:07,051 --> 00:42:09,136
And I'm Gang Da-eul of Alanga.

613
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,847
Nice to meet you. I'm Lee Ro-un.

614
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:13,349
We have a new member for Team Go Hard.

615
00:42:13,432 --> 00:42:15,101
Welcome. Take a seat.

616
00:42:16,269 --> 00:42:17,228
Excuse me.

617
00:42:17,854 --> 00:42:19,021
One beer, please.

618
00:42:20,481 --> 00:42:22,358
Let's make a toast for our newest member.

619
00:42:23,025 --> 00:42:24,527
Right, Ro-un.

620
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:26,737
When I say "Go hard," you say it too.

621
00:42:26,821 --> 00:42:28,447
- Okay.
- Go hard!

622
00:42:28,948 --> 00:42:30,616
- Go hard!
- Go hard!

623
00:42:58,311 --> 00:43:01,689
This is the icon of Bangkok, ICONSIAM.

624
00:43:01,772 --> 00:43:03,065
A round of applause.

625
00:43:03,149 --> 00:43:04,233
This is the fountain.

626
00:43:04,317 --> 00:43:06,485
Let's take a photo
with the ferry in the background.

627
00:43:06,569 --> 00:43:07,737
- Sounds great.
- Okay.

628
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:09,238
- Of course.
- Another picture?

629
00:43:09,322 --> 00:43:11,198
- To remember this.
- We need to. Come in.

630
00:43:11,282 --> 00:43:12,950
- Is everyone in?
- Yes, we are.

631
00:43:13,034 --> 00:43:14,827
I'll take it. One, two, three.

632
00:43:20,249 --> 00:43:22,001
I knew this would happen!

633
00:43:22,668 --> 00:43:24,086
I knew it!

634
00:45:19,869 --> 00:45:21,912
I had fun. Please excuse me.

635
00:45:21,996 --> 00:45:23,706
No, you can't go.

636
00:45:23,789 --> 00:45:25,207
You're already here with us.

637
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:26,584
Stay over.

638
00:45:27,084 --> 00:45:27,918
May I really?

639
00:45:28,002 --> 00:45:28,836
Of course.

640
00:45:28,919 --> 00:45:29,754
He can't.

641
00:45:29,837 --> 00:45:32,715
Flight crew only stay
in designated hotels during layovers.

642
00:45:32,798 --> 00:45:33,966
You don't have to worry.

643
00:45:34,049 --> 00:45:36,677
Mr. No can take care of that, right?

644
00:45:40,973 --> 00:45:43,350
Well, I can.

645
00:45:44,977 --> 00:45:45,936
But there's no room.

646
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:47,146
What do you mean?

647
00:45:47,229 --> 00:45:48,397
One for women, one for men.

648
00:45:48,481 --> 00:45:49,565
We have two rooms.

649
00:45:49,648 --> 00:45:53,736
And our room has a king size bed,
so it fits three.

650
00:45:53,819 --> 00:45:56,238
It's not a king. It's a queen.

651
00:45:56,322 --> 00:45:58,199
I don't mind sleeping on the floor.

652
00:45:58,282 --> 00:45:59,909
No, you'll catch a cold.

653
00:45:59,992 --> 00:46:02,328
It's huge. It's big enough for three.

654
00:46:03,496 --> 00:46:04,538
In that case…

655
00:46:07,291 --> 00:46:08,667
Sure, I'll stay.

656
00:46:08,751 --> 00:46:09,585
Thank you, sir.

657
00:46:10,294 --> 00:46:12,963
Then let's make a toast
to celebrate the six siblings.

658
00:46:13,047 --> 00:46:14,673
Yes, a toast.

659
00:46:14,757 --> 00:46:15,966
Okay.

660
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:17,009
Go hard!

661
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:19,261
- Go hard!
- Go hard!

662
00:46:27,228 --> 00:46:28,896
Come to think of it,

663
00:46:28,979 --> 00:46:33,818
I haven't slept together
with a group of guys since college.

664
00:46:34,443 --> 00:46:35,694
I've wanted to do this.

665
00:46:37,029 --> 00:46:38,614
When you travel with friends,

666
00:46:38,697 --> 00:46:42,243
a huge group of guys
end up sleeping in a room half this size.

667
00:46:42,326 --> 00:46:44,328
But it never felt uncomfortable.

668
00:46:44,411 --> 00:46:45,412
- Right?
- Right.

669
00:46:46,038 --> 00:46:47,790
I'm uncomfortable right now.

670
00:46:47,873 --> 00:46:49,250
Let's go to sleep.

671
00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:50,584
Sure, I'm not stopping you.

672
00:46:51,168 --> 00:46:52,670
Ro-un and I have lots to discuss.

673
00:46:53,546 --> 00:46:54,547
I love it.

674
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:56,423
Then you two can chat outside.

675
00:46:57,216 --> 00:46:58,133
I'm tired.

676
00:46:58,217 --> 00:46:59,385
So go to sleep.

677
00:46:59,468 --> 00:47:02,388
Just imagine you're alone
and that you need to sleep.

678
00:47:02,471 --> 00:47:03,931
You'll fall asleep in no time.

679
00:47:04,014 --> 00:47:05,099
Right?

680
00:47:05,182 --> 00:47:07,142
- Yes.
- What kind of horseshit is this?

681
00:47:09,854 --> 00:47:11,939
You two seem close. You're like friends.

682
00:47:12,022 --> 00:47:13,190
Friends?

683
00:47:13,274 --> 00:47:16,151
I absolutely detest people
who are like Mr. Yoo.

684
00:47:16,944 --> 00:47:19,071
Mr. No tends to be
a little clingy with me.

685
00:47:21,824 --> 00:47:23,701
He has no friends due to his personality.

686
00:47:23,784 --> 00:47:25,411
- Really?
- No.

687
00:47:25,494 --> 00:47:27,204
So I've been looking after him

688
00:47:27,288 --> 00:47:28,747
with my generous heart. Right?

689
00:47:28,831 --> 00:47:30,374
I'm turning the lights off. Night.

690
00:47:30,457 --> 00:47:32,751
- No, don't turn them off.
- Go to sleep.

691
00:47:32,835 --> 00:47:33,919
Turn the lights on.

692
00:47:34,545 --> 00:47:36,630
I'm talking to you, Mr. No.

693
00:47:36,714 --> 00:47:38,757
I'm a department manager
and you're a manager.

694
00:47:38,841 --> 00:47:40,092
Turn them back on now.

695
00:47:42,052 --> 00:47:44,179
I've put up with your nonsense all day.

696
00:47:44,263 --> 00:47:45,097
Wait!

697
00:47:46,348 --> 00:47:47,224
Happy now?

698
00:47:47,766 --> 00:47:49,768
Ta-da, Cho-rong!

699
00:47:49,852 --> 00:47:51,270
Look! Isn't this pretty?

700
00:47:51,353 --> 00:47:53,188
<i>It is. It's totally pretty.</i>

701
00:47:54,148 --> 00:47:55,357
And look.

702
00:47:56,942 --> 00:47:58,444
<i>What about this?</i>

703
00:47:58,527 --> 00:47:59,945
That's really cute too.

704
00:48:00,029 --> 00:48:02,364
Did you only get stuff for me?
What about you?

705
00:48:02,448 --> 00:48:04,658
What? I don't need anything.

706
00:48:05,534 --> 00:48:07,119
You don't have to buy out of need.

707
00:48:07,828 --> 00:48:09,204
Buy something if it's pretty.

708
00:48:09,830 --> 00:48:11,081
<i>Don't just buy mine tomorrow.</i>

709
00:48:11,165 --> 00:48:13,500
Make sure you get something
for yourself too, okay?

710
00:48:13,584 --> 00:48:14,668
<i>Promise me.</i>

711
00:48:14,752 --> 00:48:16,420
Okay, I promise.

712
00:48:16,503 --> 00:48:17,713
<i>Be careful of cars.</i>

713
00:48:17,796 --> 00:48:19,381
<i>And don't follow bad people.</i>

714
00:48:19,465 --> 00:48:21,008
Make sure you stay with the aunties.

715
00:48:21,091 --> 00:48:22,593
Okay, I'll be careful.

716
00:48:23,427 --> 00:48:25,262
Goodnight sweetie.

717
00:48:25,346 --> 00:48:27,348
<i>- I love you.</i>
- I love you too.

718
00:48:27,431 --> 00:48:29,308
- Goodnight.
- <i>Goodnight!</i>

719
00:48:34,563 --> 00:48:36,857
What would you have done without Cho-rong?

720
00:48:36,941 --> 00:48:38,442
I'm not jealous that you're married,

721
00:48:38,525 --> 00:48:40,361
but I <i>am</i> jealous
that you have a daughter like her.

722
00:48:40,444 --> 00:48:41,278
Me too.

723
00:48:41,362 --> 00:48:45,115
You should try having one too.
They're not adorable all the time.

724
00:48:45,199 --> 00:48:48,535
But giving birth to Cho-rong is still
the best thing I've done in my life.

725
00:48:54,208 --> 00:48:55,292
Take this.

726
00:48:55,918 --> 00:48:57,002
What's this?

727
00:48:58,504 --> 00:49:00,214
We picked it up on the way.

728
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:02,257
What?

729
00:49:05,219 --> 00:49:06,553
What is this?

730
00:49:07,763 --> 00:49:09,640
Girls, come on.

731
00:49:09,723 --> 00:49:11,558
You two are giving me the feels.

732
00:49:11,642 --> 00:49:15,354
Cho-rong tells you to look after yourself,
but you don't listen.

733
00:49:15,437 --> 00:49:17,564
What can we do? We have to look after you.

734
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:21,360
Thank you. I mean it.

735
00:49:24,822 --> 00:49:26,532
- What's going on?
- No.

736
00:49:26,615 --> 00:49:27,741
- No.
- Hey.

737
00:49:27,825 --> 00:49:30,577
- No. I'm not crying.
- You better not be crying right now.

738
00:49:30,661 --> 00:49:32,705
We'll tease you for life if you cry now.

739
00:49:32,788 --> 00:49:33,664
Never.

740
00:49:34,248 --> 00:49:35,499
Come on.

741
00:49:36,834 --> 00:49:38,293
You two are the best.

742
00:49:38,794 --> 00:49:40,713
- Come on.
- You're the only ones for me.

743
00:49:40,796 --> 00:49:42,256
Thank you.

744
00:49:45,634 --> 00:49:48,137
Me too. You two are the only ones for me.

745
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:52,349
Not you.

746
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:54,184
You've got Ro-un,

747
00:49:54,268 --> 00:49:56,478
who came all the way to Thailand
just for you.

748
00:49:56,562 --> 00:49:57,771
That's really not it.

749
00:49:58,397 --> 00:50:00,941
"I stopped by to see Pyeong-hwa.
Nice to meet you."

750
00:50:01,025 --> 00:50:02,860
"I don't mind sleeping on the floor."

751
00:50:02,943 --> 00:50:04,611
It's not like that.

752
00:50:04,695 --> 00:50:06,572
It's not. Nothing's going on.

753
00:50:06,655 --> 00:50:08,824
- "Then I'll stay. Thank you."
- That's enough.

754
00:50:08,907 --> 00:50:10,284
- Cut it out.
- Why?

755
00:50:10,367 --> 00:50:12,119
- Hey, just cut it out!
- "Pyeong-hwa--"

756
00:50:12,202 --> 00:50:13,495
- What's wrong?
- My gosh.

757
00:50:13,579 --> 00:50:15,039
- Are you all right?
- Why?

758
00:50:15,122 --> 00:50:16,582
- I'm sorry.
- "Pyeong-hwa."

759
00:50:16,665 --> 00:50:17,791
"Are you okay, Pyeong-hwa?"

760
00:50:18,375 --> 00:50:19,960
"I'm okay, Pyeong-hwa."

761
00:50:20,044 --> 00:50:21,795
I knew you'd say that!

762
00:50:21,879 --> 00:50:23,839
- I knew it!
- "I'm all right, Pyeong-hwa."

763
00:50:23,922 --> 00:50:25,174
So sweet!

764
00:50:25,257 --> 00:50:27,092
"I'm fine, Pyeong-hwa."

765
00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:30,929
- Stop it!
- "I came because I missed you so much."

766
00:50:31,013 --> 00:50:32,473
"Pyeong-hwa."

767
00:50:32,556 --> 00:50:34,016
- "Pyeong-hwa."
- I can't hear you.

768
00:50:34,099 --> 00:50:38,937
"I can sleep on the cold hard floor
if it means I can be with you!"

769
00:51:25,025 --> 00:51:26,777
<i>Make sure you eat before you leave.</i>

770
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:27,903
<i>Thanks.</i>

771
00:52:04,523 --> 00:52:05,607
Mr. Yoo.

772
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,401
Mr. Yoo.

773
00:52:07,484 --> 00:52:08,735
- Is Sa-rang gone?
- She's not there?

774
00:52:08,819 --> 00:52:10,445
No. Mr. No's gone too.

775
00:52:11,321 --> 00:52:12,447
- Over there.
- What?

776
00:52:13,937 --> 00:52:15,188
- Is Sa-rang gone?
- She's not there?

777
00:52:15,272 --> 00:52:16,898
No. Mr. No's gone too.

778
00:52:17,774 --> 00:52:18,900
- Over there.
- What?

779
00:52:20,611 --> 00:52:21,570
Mr. No!

780
00:52:22,154 --> 00:52:23,071
Where are you going?

781
00:52:23,655 --> 00:52:24,781
Where are you going?

782
00:52:26,867 --> 00:52:28,243
Where are you going?

783
00:52:29,077 --> 00:52:31,872
We're leaving to find freedom.

784
00:52:31,955 --> 00:52:33,665
Goodbye, everyone!

785
00:52:34,249 --> 00:52:35,626
Hey, Cheon Sa-rang!

786
00:52:35,709 --> 00:52:37,336
You traitor!

787
00:52:37,419 --> 00:52:40,631
Wait for me! I want to come too!

788
00:53:17,501 --> 00:53:19,086
- Isn't it pretty?
- Yes.

789
00:53:43,151 --> 00:53:44,069
You're good.

790
00:53:48,407 --> 00:53:49,408
Korean?

791
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:50,784
Yes.

792
00:53:50,867 --> 00:53:52,953
You two look so pretty.

793
00:53:53,036 --> 00:53:55,205
You're the prince and you're the princess.

794
00:53:55,288 --> 00:53:57,207
Beautiful.

795
00:53:57,290 --> 00:53:59,292
- Take a photo.
- It's okay.

796
00:53:59,376 --> 00:54:01,086
No, let's take one. I want to.

797
00:54:02,254 --> 00:54:03,296
Yes.

798
00:54:06,842 --> 00:54:09,177
- This time, you have to smile.
- I shall smile.

799
00:54:10,345 --> 00:54:11,513
And make a heart.

800
00:54:12,097 --> 00:54:13,140
I shall make that too.

801
00:54:13,765 --> 00:54:14,850
And smile.

802
00:54:15,767 --> 00:54:16,768
Good.

803
00:54:26,153 --> 00:54:26,987
Hello.

804
00:54:40,917 --> 00:54:42,210
What is this place?

805
00:54:43,545 --> 00:54:46,590
I told you there was a place
I wanted to go with you, right?

806
00:54:47,257 --> 00:54:48,383
This is it.

807
00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:52,637
It's as beautiful as a painting.

808
00:54:53,513 --> 00:54:56,600
I'd be so happy if I could see
a view like this every day.

809
00:54:59,352 --> 00:55:00,395
Should we live here?

810
00:55:02,731 --> 00:55:04,065
Sounds like a dream.

811
00:55:04,149 --> 00:55:05,776
Then we'll live like a dream.

812
00:55:29,132 --> 00:55:30,634
Enjoy your meal.

813
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:34,888
Are you that happy?

814
00:55:36,097 --> 00:55:38,475
I've had lots of Thai food,
but nothing like this.

815
00:55:39,142 --> 00:55:42,229
It's all so pretty.
And it all looks so good!

816
00:55:43,897 --> 00:55:45,607
Try this one first. Open up.

817
00:55:50,570 --> 00:55:51,655
It's good.

818
00:56:03,208 --> 00:56:04,835
This is so good. Here.

819
00:56:09,089 --> 00:56:10,382
- Isn't it?
- Yes.

820
00:56:12,342 --> 00:56:14,094
Take your time and try the others too.

821
00:56:25,605 --> 00:56:26,857
Did you enjoy dinner?

822
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:29,192
Yes, it was so good.

823
00:56:32,654 --> 00:56:34,364
And the night view is so pretty.

824
00:56:36,491 --> 00:56:38,618
I'm very glad that you like it.

825
00:56:45,375 --> 00:56:46,543
I never

826
00:56:47,127 --> 00:56:49,421
hoped for anything since my childhood.

827
00:56:50,672 --> 00:56:52,591
I was afraid my hopes and desires

828
00:56:52,674 --> 00:56:55,135
would take away
the things that are dear to me.

829
00:56:56,803 --> 00:56:58,555
But I keep wanting more.

830
00:57:00,807 --> 00:57:04,686
I feel so happy that I begin to wonder
if I'm allowed this much happiness.

831
00:57:06,771 --> 00:57:10,901
I keep hoping that
I'll continue to be this happy.

832
00:57:16,239 --> 00:57:17,657
It's okay to want more.

833
00:57:19,075 --> 00:57:22,787
The things you want to do,
want to have, and want to become.

834
00:57:24,122 --> 00:57:25,457
You can want it all.

835
00:57:26,291 --> 00:57:27,500
You deserve it.

836
00:57:49,064 --> 00:57:50,941
My sister and I have different moms.

837
00:57:53,109 --> 00:57:55,570
My father had me
after he remarried my mom.

838
00:57:58,531 --> 00:58:00,242
She disappeared when I was young.

839
00:58:01,534 --> 00:58:02,953
All of a sudden,

840
00:58:03,787 --> 00:58:04,955
without a word.

841
00:58:06,498 --> 00:58:08,208
<i>I was wailing as I looked for her,</i>

842
00:58:09,167 --> 00:58:11,544
<i>but everyone else
had a smile on their faces.</i>

843
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:16,091
<i>It was the first time I thought
smiles could look monstrous.</i>

844
00:58:17,133 --> 00:58:18,260
And that in my life…

845
00:58:19,928 --> 00:58:22,097
no one showed their genuine emotions.

846
00:58:25,934 --> 00:58:27,560
Then along came Cheon Sa-rang

847
00:58:28,561 --> 00:58:29,938
with her genuine emotions.

848
00:58:33,858 --> 00:58:36,695
Do you still have no idea where she is?

849
00:58:37,445 --> 00:58:38,697
You haven't heard from her?

850
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:39,781
No.

851
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:44,953
I kept looking,
but there was no trace of her.

852
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:46,621
It's as if

853
00:58:47,247 --> 00:58:50,667
she never existed in this world.

854
00:58:52,127 --> 00:58:57,382
I don't know if she abandoned me
or if she had a reason to leave.

855
00:58:57,882 --> 00:59:00,218
So I'm not sure
if I should miss her or despise her.

856
00:59:01,886 --> 00:59:03,513
I'm sure she's somewhere.

857
00:59:04,556 --> 00:59:05,765
Let's find her together.

858
00:59:14,274 --> 00:59:15,608
You don't have to do that.

859
00:59:16,693 --> 00:59:19,195
I was just curious.
I didn't exactly want to see her.

860
00:59:21,114 --> 00:59:22,657
And I'm not even curious anymore.

861
00:59:31,291 --> 00:59:33,376
The night view is nice. Let's go out.

862
01:00:01,446 --> 01:00:03,907
Thank you for coming into my life.

863
01:00:07,077 --> 01:00:09,788
Thank <i>you</i> for coming into my life.

864
01:00:39,150 --> 01:00:40,527
I prepared something.

865
01:00:42,195 --> 01:00:43,238
Ta-da…

866
01:00:46,805 --> 01:00:47,931
This isn't it.

867
01:00:48,034 --> 01:00:49,411
This is VIP.

868
01:00:49,494 --> 01:00:53,915
No, I asked for a VIP sedan
when I made the reservation.

869
01:00:53,998 --> 01:00:56,251
Yes, this is VIP.

870
01:01:02,424 --> 01:01:04,050
Well, what can we do?

871
01:01:04,134 --> 01:01:05,427
It's for VIPs.

872
01:01:06,052 --> 01:01:06,886
You're right.

873
01:01:07,470 --> 01:01:08,304
Let's hop on.

874
01:01:42,922 --> 01:01:43,923
Look at that.

875
01:01:44,007 --> 01:01:45,592
Let's make a short stop.

876
01:01:45,675 --> 01:01:46,634
There?

877
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:03,234
This is great.

878
01:02:04,027 --> 01:02:05,695
You said that about 100 times.

879
01:02:05,778 --> 01:02:07,197
But it really is great.

880
01:02:08,781 --> 01:02:10,408
The full moon! Make a wish.

881
01:02:29,552 --> 01:02:30,512
All done?

882
01:02:31,137 --> 01:02:31,971
Yes.

883
01:02:49,405 --> 01:02:50,823
This is wonderful.

884
01:03:15,473 --> 01:03:17,725
What did you wish for on the moon?

885
01:03:21,938 --> 01:03:24,482
That I would always be
as happy as I am now.

886
01:03:24,566 --> 01:03:26,526
Is this good enough for you?

887
01:03:27,402 --> 01:03:29,070
You should've wished for more.

888
01:03:31,239 --> 01:03:32,532
Then what did you wish for?

889
01:03:34,659 --> 01:03:36,202
Me? Nothing.

890
01:03:36,911 --> 01:03:37,912
Why not?

891
01:03:39,539 --> 01:03:41,374
There's nothing more to ask for.

892
01:03:43,626 --> 01:03:45,086
I have you with me.

893
01:03:46,045 --> 01:03:47,630
I don't need anything else.

894
01:03:50,675 --> 01:03:53,845
Oh, but I did say a word of gratitude

895
01:03:53,928 --> 01:03:55,513
for giving me someone so precious.

896
01:03:57,181 --> 01:03:58,224
Thank you.

897
01:04:00,935 --> 01:04:03,688
I love you, Sa-rang.

898
01:04:08,276 --> 01:04:09,527
I love you too.

899
01:04:46,606 --> 01:04:49,609
KING THE LAND

900
01:05:21,683 --> 01:05:24,185
{\an8}<i>The guest list for the
100th-anniversary event isn't finalized.</i>

901
01:05:24,268 --> 01:05:26,020
{\an8}Yes it is.
I just need to make a final decision.

902
01:05:26,104 --> 01:05:27,814
{\an8}<i>Invite the people on that list.</i>

903
01:05:27,897 --> 01:05:30,483
{\an8}<i>It's my responsibility,
so I'll do whatever I want.</i>
