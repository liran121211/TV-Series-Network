00:00:00,132 --> 00:00:04,606
KING THE LAND

2
00:00:04,687 --> 00:00:09,280
KING THE LAND

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,266
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,999
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

5
00:00:13,505 --> 00:00:14,381
PERSONNEL RECORDS

6
00:00:14,465 --> 00:00:16,425
Is that everything from 1989?

7
00:00:17,635 --> 00:00:18,510
Yes.

8
00:00:18,594 --> 00:00:21,263
Who are you looking for if I may ask?

9
00:00:23,098 --> 00:00:25,100
I don't know why you came to work here,

10
00:00:25,184 --> 00:00:26,977
but you'll have to fight me for life.

11
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:28,938
I'm telling you for your sake.

12
00:00:29,021 --> 00:00:31,106
Don't end up like your mom.

13
00:00:33,275 --> 00:00:34,193
Never mind.

14
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:43,410
- Hello.
- Hello.

15
00:01:02,554 --> 00:01:04,348
Please come downstairs and eat.

16
00:01:05,307 --> 00:01:06,642
Where's my mom?

17
00:01:07,393 --> 00:01:10,062
She wasn't here yesterday,
and she's not here today.

18
00:01:10,688 --> 00:01:12,523
Please get up.

19
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:14,108
The chairman is waiting.

20
00:01:17,736 --> 00:01:18,779
Come along.

21
00:01:36,422 --> 00:01:37,590
Hello.

22
00:01:39,758 --> 00:01:40,759
Hello.

23
00:01:42,344 --> 00:01:43,554
Hello.

24
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:45,514
Hello.

25
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:54,982
Don't smile.

26
00:01:57,276 --> 00:01:58,819
Stop smiling.

27
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:06,827
Don't smile!

28
00:02:07,328 --> 00:02:09,246
I said stop smiling!

29
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,906
<i>Don't smile.</i>

30
00:02:48,118 --> 00:02:49,286
<i>Stop smiling.</i>

31
00:04:26,383 --> 00:04:27,760
This is my spot.

32
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:30,095
Excuse me?

33
00:04:32,848 --> 00:04:33,849
This is

34
00:04:35,392 --> 00:04:36,685
my spot.

35
00:05:17,059 --> 00:05:18,310
So you know how to cry?

36
00:05:28,445 --> 00:05:29,988
I'll allow it for a moment.

37
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:33,200
Stay still.

38
00:05:57,933 --> 00:05:58,934
Let's go.

39
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:01,937
I'll take you home.

40
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:10,821
It's okay. I can go on my own.

41
00:06:33,135 --> 00:06:34,177
Get in.

42
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:54,156
Where's your umbrella?

43
00:06:55,532 --> 00:06:56,783
It flew away.

44
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:02,414
You should've held on to it.

45
00:07:06,168 --> 00:07:07,753
I didn't want to.

46
00:07:10,047 --> 00:07:12,716
It was carried far away by the wind…

47
00:07:16,845 --> 00:07:18,889
and for some reason,
it made me feel at ease.

48
00:07:21,934 --> 00:07:24,770
Maybe I should've let go a lot earlier.

49
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:29,107
Is this about your umbrella?

50
00:07:33,195 --> 00:07:34,571
Or is it about your love life?

51
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:44,206
You can drop me off anywhere
near a subway station.

52
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,285
EPISODE 5

53
00:09:59,216 --> 00:10:00,175
Hey.

54
00:10:04,262 --> 00:10:05,972
- Phony Cheon.
- Yes, sir.

55
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:10,769
What?

56
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,396
Where are we?

57
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:16,608
Here.

58
00:10:18,902 --> 00:10:19,820
What is this?

59
00:10:19,903 --> 00:10:21,071
It probably won't fit.

60
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:22,781
Just wear it today and throw it out later.

61
00:10:22,864 --> 00:10:23,990
Wait, sir.

62
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,035
Let's eat.

63
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,329
It's your birthday.

64
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:19,588
What the…

65
00:11:20,297 --> 00:11:21,756
Your outfit…

66
00:11:22,632 --> 00:11:23,592
Wait.

67
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,512
People will think we're a couple.

68
00:11:35,054 --> 00:11:36,430
No one will think that.

69
00:11:36,514 --> 00:11:38,224
I could do so much better.

70
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,852
All right. Please look over here.

71
00:11:43,062 --> 00:11:45,106
You two look so good together.

72
00:11:45,189 --> 00:11:46,858
Do you want another picture?

73
00:11:46,941 --> 00:11:48,609
No, we're not together.

74
00:11:48,693 --> 00:11:49,819
I'm sorry.

75
00:11:49,902 --> 00:11:52,655
I thought you were
because you looked so good together.

76
00:11:52,738 --> 00:11:55,324
- Then what should I do with…
- You can just leave it here.

77
00:11:55,408 --> 00:11:56,409
Okay.

78
00:11:56,492 --> 00:11:58,244
Have a wonderful time.

79
00:11:58,786 --> 00:11:59,787
Thank you.

80
00:12:01,497 --> 00:12:02,540
I told you.

81
00:12:02,623 --> 00:12:04,375
She got the wrong idea.

82
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,085
Is it that unpleasant

83
00:12:06,794 --> 00:12:08,588
to be mistaken for my girlfriend?

84
00:12:08,671 --> 00:12:10,339
Why did you buy a matching outfit?

85
00:12:11,173 --> 00:12:13,509
I just asked them to give me anything.

86
00:12:14,093 --> 00:12:15,970
You're not worth my time and effort.

87
00:12:17,805 --> 00:12:18,764
That's true.

88
00:12:20,641 --> 00:12:22,602
I've never bought clothes
for someone else.

89
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,522
Although it wasn't worth my trouble

90
00:12:26,606 --> 00:12:28,274
and I knew you wouldn't like it,

91
00:12:28,983 --> 00:12:30,526
it's better than your wet clothes.

92
00:12:36,449 --> 00:12:37,867
Thank you, sir.

93
00:12:39,243 --> 00:12:40,661
I told you not to be fake.

94
00:12:41,454 --> 00:12:42,705
I'm truly thankful.

95
00:12:43,539 --> 00:12:45,333
The shoes are just the right size too.

96
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:46,417
That's a relief.

97
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,294
I just picked a random size.

98
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:43,933
Your food is ready.

99
00:13:44,016 --> 00:13:45,518
Please enjoy.

100
00:13:46,477 --> 00:13:48,771
How are we supposed to eat all of this?

101
00:13:48,854 --> 00:13:50,272
Why do we have to finish it?

102
00:13:50,356 --> 00:13:51,607
Just eat whatever you want.

103
00:13:51,691 --> 00:13:53,943
But that's so wasteful.

104
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:56,612
I didn't know what you liked.

105
00:13:56,696 --> 00:13:58,531
So you ordered all this food?

106
00:13:58,614 --> 00:13:59,782
Then you can tell me.

107
00:14:00,408 --> 00:14:02,493
- What?
- The things you like.

108
00:14:03,327 --> 00:14:04,745
Your favorite food,

109
00:14:04,829 --> 00:14:06,872
your favorite weather,
your favorite color.

110
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,376
Tell me everything you like.

111
00:14:12,044 --> 00:14:14,547
Why do you want to know that?

112
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,048
That way I won't waste anything

113
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:18,592
and can focus on what you like.

114
00:14:37,445 --> 00:14:39,488
This meal will be on me.

115
00:14:44,368 --> 00:14:45,536
It's your birthday.

116
00:14:45,619 --> 00:14:47,997
Just let me buy you a meal.

117
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:51,917
I don't usually celebrate my birthday.

118
00:14:52,001 --> 00:14:52,835
Why not?

119
00:14:54,086 --> 00:14:57,048
Because it's a day
that makes me feel insignificant.

120
00:14:58,132 --> 00:15:00,718
I get my hopes up,
and I'm constantly let down.

121
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:04,889
Not having any expectations
gives me peace of mind.

122
00:15:05,431 --> 00:15:07,016
But that's a fake feeling.

123
00:15:08,851 --> 00:15:10,561
You're fooling yourself.

124
00:15:10,644 --> 00:15:11,937
It's a false comfort.

125
00:15:13,314 --> 00:15:14,565
You're so fake.

126
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,288
I hope you enjoy the food.

127
00:15:29,955 --> 00:15:31,165
It's on me.

128
00:15:39,632 --> 00:15:41,092
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

129
00:15:42,426 --> 00:15:45,805
Your total is 1,684,000 won.

130
00:15:45,888 --> 00:15:46,722
Why?

131
00:15:47,473 --> 00:15:48,307
Pardon?

132
00:15:48,974 --> 00:15:50,309
It's nothing.

133
00:15:57,525 --> 00:15:58,734
I'll pay with this.

134
00:16:00,361 --> 00:16:02,696
- Here you go.
- No, this is on me.

135
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,907
It's your birthday privilege.

136
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,409
Enjoy it to the fullest.

137
00:16:07,326 --> 00:16:08,327
Excuse me, sir.

138
00:16:08,828 --> 00:16:10,913
I need your signature.

139
00:16:17,378 --> 00:16:18,421
Thank you.

140
00:16:21,215 --> 00:16:22,216
Thank you.

141
00:16:40,526 --> 00:16:42,695
Thank you. Get home safe.

142
00:16:42,778 --> 00:16:43,612
Hang on.

143
00:16:55,332 --> 00:16:58,252
You might think it's an insignificant day,
but end it on a sweet note.

144
00:17:02,298 --> 00:17:03,549
What? Do you not like cake?

145
00:17:04,884 --> 00:17:05,885
No.

146
00:17:08,304 --> 00:17:09,388
I love cake.

147
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,724
Thank you. I appreciate it.

148
00:17:11,807 --> 00:17:15,978
I asked our hotel's head chef to make it,
so it'll probably taste good.

149
00:17:16,061 --> 00:17:17,897
The head chef? When?

150
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:20,566
I asked him to have it made and delivered

151
00:17:21,233 --> 00:17:22,776
as we walked into the restaurant.

152
00:17:23,694 --> 00:17:25,404
He was probably getting ready to go home.

153
00:17:25,488 --> 00:17:28,991
That is why I very politely made
a special request.

154
00:17:29,074 --> 00:17:30,993
That's what you call being a nuisance.

155
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,163
It was a special request
from the head manager.

156
00:17:34,747 --> 00:17:36,624
It may seem like a simple favor to you,

157
00:17:36,707 --> 00:17:39,460
but for us,
it's an order that must be obeyed.

158
00:17:40,085 --> 00:17:42,463
He probably couldn't get off work
because of me.

159
00:17:43,756 --> 00:17:45,466
I didn't think that far ahead.

160
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,593
I'll be more mindful next time.

161
00:17:51,388 --> 00:17:54,391
Thank you so much for today.

162
00:17:55,518 --> 00:17:56,894
Thank you for the cake too.

163
00:17:58,521 --> 00:17:59,647
- Head inside.
- Okay.

164
00:18:04,652 --> 00:18:05,486
Of course.

165
00:18:08,364 --> 00:18:09,949
I knew it.

166
00:18:10,032 --> 00:18:11,992
Something was fishy.

167
00:18:12,076 --> 00:18:13,702
Is this why you broke up with me?

168
00:18:14,787 --> 00:18:16,121
This was your plan all along.

169
00:18:17,581 --> 00:18:18,541
Why are you here?

170
00:18:18,624 --> 00:18:19,708
Why is he here?

171
00:18:22,878 --> 00:18:23,712
Who are you?

172
00:18:23,796 --> 00:18:24,755
Who are <i>you?</i>

173
00:18:24,838 --> 00:18:26,465
Me? I'm Sa-rang's boyfriend.

174
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:28,592
How are you my boyfriend?

175
00:18:28,676 --> 00:18:29,718
You're my ex.

176
00:18:29,802 --> 00:18:31,720
Your ex? Who, me?

177
00:18:32,471 --> 00:18:34,723
We broke up so that makes you my ex.

178
00:18:34,807 --> 00:18:36,100
Who is this jerk?

179
00:18:36,183 --> 00:18:37,560
It's none of your business.

180
00:18:37,643 --> 00:18:39,979
- Why is it none of my business?
- You're her ex.

181
00:18:41,146 --> 00:18:42,982
Then it's none of your business now.

182
00:18:43,065 --> 00:18:44,108
You stay out of this.

183
00:18:46,318 --> 00:18:47,820
This is enough.

184
00:18:47,903 --> 00:18:49,280
I know you're regretting it.

185
00:18:49,363 --> 00:18:51,407
Just swallow your pride
and come back to me.

186
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,075
<i>Police. How can I help you?</i>

187
00:18:53,158 --> 00:18:53,993
Hello?

188
00:18:54,577 --> 00:18:56,662
A stalker keeps following me to my house.

189
00:18:56,745 --> 00:18:58,872
- The address is--
- Hey, are you serious?

190
00:18:58,956 --> 00:19:00,499
You won't listen if I ask nicely.

191
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,585
I have no choice but to report you.

192
00:19:02,668 --> 00:19:03,877
You better leave, or else.

193
00:19:03,961 --> 00:19:05,629
Why do you keep telling me to leave?

194
00:19:05,713 --> 00:19:06,922
Do you feel guilty?

195
00:19:07,006 --> 00:19:08,007
You were two-timing, right?

196
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:09,341
- Hey!
- What?

197
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,013
It was the right decision
to break up with you.

198
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:17,182
I should've done it a lot sooner.

199
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:19,852
If you

200
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,439
ever show your face again,
I'll kill you. Got that?

201
00:19:28,277 --> 00:19:29,653
If you walk away, it's over.

202
00:19:30,571 --> 00:19:31,822
There's no going back.

203
00:19:32,364 --> 00:19:33,991
It's really over for us!

204
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:36,535
That little…

205
00:19:38,871 --> 00:19:40,331
- What's your deal?
- She told you to leave.

206
00:19:40,414 --> 00:19:42,541
- Let go.
- Didn't you hear her?

207
00:19:43,417 --> 00:19:45,669
She was crying alone
on her birthday, no less.

208
00:19:46,545 --> 00:19:48,047
I just barely got her to smile.

209
00:19:48,547 --> 00:19:49,840
Don't ruin it. Just leave.

210
00:19:49,923 --> 00:19:51,091
Who are you to…

211
00:19:52,926 --> 00:19:54,178
Let go.

212
00:19:54,261 --> 00:19:55,429
I said let go!

213
00:19:58,682 --> 00:19:59,683
Let go.

214
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:01,644
Let go, please.

215
00:20:01,727 --> 00:20:03,896
She doesn't want to see you anymore.

216
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:07,775
Stalking someone and harassing them
is considered violence.

217
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:10,069
If you ever want to meet her,

218
00:20:10,152 --> 00:20:11,820
ask her politely in advance.

219
00:20:13,197 --> 00:20:14,198
Got that?

220
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,415
Gosh, darn it.

221
00:20:27,461 --> 00:20:28,504
You'll pay for this.

222
00:21:04,373 --> 00:21:05,582
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

223
00:21:11,505 --> 00:21:13,090
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

224
00:21:18,512 --> 00:21:19,722
Does she not know it's me?

225
00:21:20,222 --> 00:21:22,766
THANK YOU

226
00:21:29,481 --> 00:21:30,858
<i>You know who this is, right?</i>

227
00:21:38,615 --> 00:21:40,367
- Hello?
- It's me.

228
00:21:41,076 --> 00:21:41,994
I know.

229
00:21:42,661 --> 00:21:44,496
Then why didn't you reply?

230
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,248
You didn't give me the chance to.

231
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:49,376
By any chance,

232
00:21:49,877 --> 00:21:51,962
if something like that happens again,

233
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,006
just call me.

234
00:21:54,089 --> 00:21:55,799
Don't bother the overworked police.

235
00:21:56,383 --> 00:21:57,885
It won't happen again.

236
00:21:58,385 --> 00:21:59,761
Don't worry and get home safe.

237
00:21:59,845 --> 00:22:03,807
As your boss,
I'm only trying to keep my employee safe,

238
00:22:03,891 --> 00:22:05,392
so feel free to call me.

239
00:22:06,894 --> 00:22:08,395
Okay. I understand.

240
00:22:18,071 --> 00:22:18,947
Hello?

241
00:22:21,325 --> 00:22:22,534
Happy birthday.

242
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:28,248
<i>I didn't get the chance
to tell you that earlier.</i>

243
00:22:31,793 --> 00:22:32,836
Thank you.

244
00:22:33,962 --> 00:22:36,465
<i>All right then. Get some rest.</i>

245
00:22:36,965 --> 00:22:38,050
All right. You--

246
00:22:53,023 --> 00:22:54,191
Let's go.

247
00:23:34,856 --> 00:23:38,402
<i>Congratulations</i>

248
00:23:38,485 --> 00:23:41,280
<i>Congratulations on being in last place</i>

249
00:23:44,032 --> 00:23:47,452
Our team is finally
the only team that ranked last!

250
00:23:49,538 --> 00:23:50,998
Why the long faces?

251
00:23:52,082 --> 00:23:53,792
Are you trying to screw me over?

252
00:23:54,418 --> 00:23:57,713
I was just humiliated
in front of all the managers.

253
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:01,883
Since we achieved our goal,
we should celebrate.

254
00:24:04,052 --> 00:24:05,262
- We're sorry.
- We're sorry.

255
00:24:07,681 --> 00:24:08,724
"Sorry"?

256
00:24:08,807 --> 00:24:10,559
Is this how you act when you're sorry?

257
00:24:11,602 --> 00:24:12,561
Listen.

258
00:24:12,644 --> 00:24:14,646
Are you all in cahoots to get me sacked?

259
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,857
Who's in charge of in-flight sales today?

260
00:24:18,692 --> 00:24:19,651
Me.

261
00:24:20,902 --> 00:24:24,615
In-flight sales begin
the moment passengers board.

262
00:24:24,698 --> 00:24:26,116
You have to grovel,

263
00:24:26,199 --> 00:24:27,451
put on a pretty smile,

264
00:24:27,534 --> 00:24:28,910
lift their luggage,

265
00:24:28,994 --> 00:24:30,120
serve them their food,

266
00:24:30,203 --> 00:24:31,997
and do all that you can

267
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,958
so that the passengers
can't help but think,

268
00:24:35,042 --> 00:24:37,377
"Wow, I really should
buy something from her."

269
00:24:37,461 --> 00:24:39,254
- Yes, ma'am.
- Mark my words.

270
00:24:39,338 --> 00:24:43,050
If we don't come in first this month,
we're all going down together.

271
00:24:44,593 --> 00:24:45,719
Is that clear?

272
00:24:46,303 --> 00:24:47,387
- Yes, ma'am!
- Yes, ma'am!

273
00:24:52,142 --> 00:24:53,018
Here you go, ma'am.

274
00:24:53,977 --> 00:24:57,356
Speak casually when we're alone.
We started at the same time after all.

275
00:24:58,815 --> 00:24:59,691
Okay.

276
00:24:59,775 --> 00:25:01,193
You should get that promotion this year.

277
00:25:03,904 --> 00:25:05,197
I want to,

278
00:25:05,822 --> 00:25:07,366
but I might have to give up on it.

279
00:25:07,449 --> 00:25:10,369
You don't want to be looked down on
your whole life, do you?

280
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:13,330
All of our colleagues are pursers now.

281
00:25:14,539 --> 00:25:15,916
Only you wear a white scarf.

282
00:25:17,918 --> 00:25:21,338
Because of that,
they all secretly think little of you.

283
00:25:21,421 --> 00:25:23,924
They even made a group chat without you.
How childish.

284
00:25:25,884 --> 00:25:27,427
There's a group chat without me?

285
00:25:28,011 --> 00:25:29,221
That's what I'm saying.

286
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:32,265
All the more reason for you
to get that promotion.

287
00:25:32,349 --> 00:25:36,019
What good are your top scores
in some language certifications?

288
00:25:36,561 --> 00:25:38,605
You don't have anyone
to pull strings for you.

289
00:25:39,898 --> 00:25:40,982
I'll help you.

290
00:25:43,193 --> 00:25:44,027
Really?

291
00:25:44,111 --> 00:25:46,488
Increase the in-flight sales in return.

292
00:25:46,571 --> 00:25:48,281
If we rank first,

293
00:25:48,365 --> 00:25:50,617
I'll make sure
to pull some strings for you.

294
00:25:52,577 --> 00:25:53,995
Okay, I will.

295
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,248
I'll do my best.

296
00:26:10,637 --> 00:26:11,763
I'm home.

297
00:26:12,347 --> 00:26:13,181
Hey.

298
00:26:15,392 --> 00:26:16,727
There you guys go again.

299
00:26:36,955 --> 00:26:38,832
- What?
- Why would you do that?

300
00:26:39,708 --> 00:26:40,667
Hey, what's--

301
00:26:47,507 --> 00:26:48,425
So,

302
00:26:48,508 --> 00:26:50,010
there's nothing going on,

303
00:26:50,093 --> 00:26:52,971
but he bought you something
from Thom Brownie for getting wet?

304
00:26:54,139 --> 00:26:55,056
I know, right?

305
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,267
And you're not going to tell us who he is?

306
00:27:00,687 --> 00:27:01,605
Okay. Fine.

307
00:27:02,397 --> 00:27:05,400
Whoever he is, he's definitely trying
to win you over with money.

308
00:27:05,484 --> 00:27:06,693
It's not like that.

309
00:27:06,777 --> 00:27:09,112
I just asked them to give me anything.

310
00:27:09,196 --> 00:27:10,989
You're not worth my time and effort.

311
00:27:11,072 --> 00:27:13,033
Do you know how much this costs?

312
00:27:13,116 --> 00:27:14,826
He bought all this
when he doesn't even like you?

313
00:27:15,994 --> 00:27:19,289
Hey, men don't spend money
on women they're not interested in.

314
00:27:19,372 --> 00:27:21,750
If he's this into you, just date him.

315
00:27:22,626 --> 00:27:24,169
I'm all for it too.

316
00:27:24,252 --> 00:27:27,798
He even bought you shoes
because yours were wet.

317
00:27:27,881 --> 00:27:29,841
How did he know your shoe size?

318
00:27:29,925 --> 00:27:30,842
Did you tell him?

319
00:27:32,636 --> 00:27:33,470
No.

320
00:27:33,553 --> 00:27:34,554
That's a relief.

321
00:27:35,096 --> 00:27:36,473
I just picked a random size.

322
00:27:37,265 --> 00:27:40,101
You're going to show your appreciation
for this precious gift, right?

323
00:27:40,894 --> 00:27:41,978
I'm not sure.

324
00:27:43,396 --> 00:27:45,857
Think about it, ma'am.

325
00:27:45,941 --> 00:27:47,442
He gave you a gift and his heart.

326
00:27:47,526 --> 00:27:50,070
You'd be a horrible woman
if you didn't get him anything.

327
00:27:50,153 --> 00:27:51,363
Where's your conscience?

328
00:27:52,405 --> 00:27:53,573
That's true.

329
00:27:54,157 --> 00:27:55,826
But I don't know what he likes

330
00:27:55,909 --> 00:27:57,661
and he's very particular.

331
00:27:57,744 --> 00:27:59,788
Don't worry, ma'am.

332
00:27:59,871 --> 00:28:02,666
At Alanga, we have
a brand-new card wallet that's perfect

333
00:28:02,749 --> 00:28:04,376
for even the pickiest of customers.

334
00:28:04,459 --> 00:28:06,878
Stop trying to sell me stuff.
You don't even know who he is.

335
00:28:06,962 --> 00:28:08,505
I'll give you a big discount.

336
00:28:09,172 --> 00:28:11,049
Forget it. I'm not buying anything.

337
00:28:11,883 --> 00:28:14,886
Ma'am, what do you think of this cologne?

338
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:17,514
It's not too expensive
and it's the most popular item

339
00:28:17,597 --> 00:28:18,932
among young men these days.

340
00:28:19,015 --> 00:28:22,102
I think it'll be perfect
for his sophisticated style.

341
00:28:22,185 --> 00:28:23,728
Would you like one?

342
00:28:23,812 --> 00:28:25,605
Why are you butting in all of a sudden?

343
00:28:25,689 --> 00:28:26,523
You brat.

344
00:28:27,274 --> 00:28:28,692
I'm desperate.

345
00:28:28,775 --> 00:28:30,277
Please understand.

346
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,194
What?

347
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:33,113
Did you not meet your sales quota again?

348
00:28:33,196 --> 00:28:34,698
We came in last again.

349
00:28:34,781 --> 00:28:36,324
Please help me out, Ms. Gang.

350
00:28:37,367 --> 00:28:38,410
Buy the cologne.

351
00:28:38,493 --> 00:28:39,911
Buy two while you're at it.

352
00:28:40,912 --> 00:28:42,122
I said I'm not going to!

353
00:28:42,205 --> 00:28:45,417
Please buy something!
You can't deplane without buying anything.

354
00:28:46,835 --> 00:28:47,919
What's wrong with you?

355
00:28:48,962 --> 00:28:49,921
Are you Gang Da-eul?

356
00:28:50,755 --> 00:28:52,465
What happened to our kind Pyeong-hwa?

357
00:28:52,549 --> 00:28:54,926
Snap out of it. Come to your senses!

358
00:28:55,552 --> 00:28:58,096
The flight attendants at King Air
reduce our own luggage

359
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:01,224
to have a large stock of duty-free items.

360
00:29:01,308 --> 00:29:02,309
We have everything.

361
00:29:03,393 --> 00:29:04,728
Please buy something from me.

362
00:29:09,691 --> 00:29:11,526
- I won't.
- Hey, come on!

363
00:29:12,652 --> 00:29:13,653
Ma'am?

364
00:29:13,737 --> 00:29:15,280
You can't do this to me.

365
00:29:15,363 --> 00:29:18,158
If you didn't like that product,
there are many others, ma'am.

366
00:29:18,241 --> 00:29:20,869
Please buy something from me.

367
00:29:22,412 --> 00:29:23,788
No thanks.

368
00:29:24,372 --> 00:29:25,624
Hey!

369
00:29:26,124 --> 00:29:28,710
Ms. Lovely Sa-rang, please come out and…

370
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:01,326
Next week will be Super Farmer Week,
hosted by the purchasing team.

371
00:30:01,868 --> 00:30:04,287
We ask for King the Land's support
this year as well.

372
00:30:04,371 --> 00:30:05,914
Super Farmer Week…

373
00:30:06,665 --> 00:30:07,707
What is that?

374
00:30:08,833 --> 00:30:11,086
It's a week where we visit
vendors all across the country

375
00:30:11,169 --> 00:30:12,796
who provide our hotel with premium produce

376
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,465
and ask for their continued partnership.

377
00:30:18,677 --> 00:30:19,803
So we're soliciting.

378
00:30:21,096 --> 00:30:22,681
Nothing is free in this world.

379
00:30:22,764 --> 00:30:24,516
Great value demands great effort.

380
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:27,143
Why does it have to be King the Land
and not the team in charge?

381
00:30:27,227 --> 00:30:28,687
That's why we hired them.

382
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:31,439
They're too competent
to be running such errands.

383
00:30:31,523 --> 00:30:32,565
Find other people to do it.

384
00:30:32,649 --> 00:30:33,650
This is my hotel.

385
00:30:35,193 --> 00:30:36,903
That's for me to decide.

386
00:30:40,073 --> 00:30:41,908
That's true for every part of the hotel,

387
00:30:42,409 --> 00:30:45,996
except for the area that I'm in charge of.

388
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,749
Meeting adjourned.

389
00:30:49,833 --> 00:30:50,792
I'm off.

390
00:31:17,027 --> 00:31:20,113
I know you feel comfortable around me,
but you should at least knock.

391
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,241
- Where are you going?
- To knock.

392
00:31:24,784 --> 00:31:25,994
Don't come in.

393
00:31:30,665 --> 00:31:32,208
I told you not to come in.

394
00:31:39,049 --> 00:31:40,550
- What?
- Are you finally going head-to-head?

395
00:31:40,633 --> 00:31:41,593
What do you mean?

396
00:31:42,177 --> 00:31:43,470
Ms. Gu worked hard on this event,

397
00:31:43,553 --> 00:31:44,888
but you messed everything up.

398
00:31:44,971 --> 00:31:46,848
How is that an event? It's a scheme.

399
00:31:47,432 --> 00:31:49,559
That's not acceptable in this day and age.

400
00:31:49,642 --> 00:31:52,228
I know you're just trying to help,
but you don't have that power yet.

401
00:31:52,312 --> 00:31:55,315
So why don't you just give in this time?

402
00:31:55,398 --> 00:31:56,983
In this case, losing is winning.

403
00:31:57,984 --> 00:31:59,944
I'm not trying to win.

404
00:32:00,653 --> 00:32:02,405
I just don't want people
to run such errands.

405
00:32:03,406 --> 00:32:05,575
So long as you're here,

406
00:32:06,201 --> 00:32:07,243
there will be no peace.

407
00:32:11,456 --> 00:32:12,957
While I was in the UK,

408
00:32:13,041 --> 00:32:14,501
I dreamed of the day

409
00:32:14,584 --> 00:32:16,461
that I would return to Korea

410
00:32:16,544 --> 00:32:19,130
and make you the chairman
of King Group at all costs!

411
00:32:20,924 --> 00:32:22,050
That is why

412
00:32:22,133 --> 00:32:26,346
I've been giving you
weekly trend reports of the group.

413
00:32:26,429 --> 00:32:28,515
Why haven't you looked at them?

414
00:32:50,578 --> 00:32:51,996
- What is this?
- Hey.

415
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:52,997
Hey!

416
00:32:53,081 --> 00:32:54,582
- What is this?
- Give it back.

417
00:32:55,375 --> 00:32:57,293
- Fine. Here you go.
- Give it back.

418
00:32:57,377 --> 00:32:58,586
What is that?

419
00:32:58,670 --> 00:32:59,754
You could've torn it.

420
00:32:59,838 --> 00:33:01,256
Is it something you cherish?

421
00:33:01,339 --> 00:33:02,382
It's nothing.

422
00:33:02,465 --> 00:33:04,551
How so? You were wearing matching outfits.

423
00:33:04,634 --> 00:33:06,636
Don't be absurd. It's nothing like that.

424
00:33:06,719 --> 00:33:07,762
Yes, it is.

425
00:33:08,555 --> 00:33:10,390
Well, it was her birthday.

426
00:33:10,473 --> 00:33:11,349
Her birthday?

427
00:33:11,433 --> 00:33:13,726
Why didn't we ever wear
matching outfits on my birthday?

428
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:15,145
It was an employee benefit.

429
00:33:15,728 --> 00:33:19,190
Then can you get me a matching outfit
as an employee benefit?

430
00:33:19,274 --> 00:33:20,608
I want one too!

431
00:33:25,613 --> 00:33:26,948
I'm sorry.

432
00:33:27,532 --> 00:33:29,325
Get over here!

433
00:33:41,045 --> 00:33:42,213
He almost ripped it.

434
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:58,229
<i>Are you busy after work today?</i>

435
00:33:59,814 --> 00:34:00,857
<i>No, not at all.</i>

436
00:34:03,776 --> 00:34:04,777
Wait.

437
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:10,533
ARE YOU BUSY AFTER WORK TODAY?

438
00:34:16,956 --> 00:34:18,166
<i>Of course I am.</i>

439
00:34:21,753 --> 00:34:23,588
<i>All right, then.</i>

440
00:34:23,671 --> 00:34:24,506
What?

441
00:34:24,589 --> 00:34:25,673
That's it?

442
00:34:26,591 --> 00:34:27,759
This isn't what I wanted.

443
00:34:31,221 --> 00:34:33,431
What's the matter?

444
00:34:45,818 --> 00:34:48,363
I will probably have
a few minutes to spare.

445
00:34:57,664 --> 00:35:01,251
Shall we meet for a moment after work?

446
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:18,977
Why aren't you responding?

447
00:35:22,397 --> 00:35:23,523
Oh, gosh.

448
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,318
Did I have to come here myself?

449
00:35:27,944 --> 00:35:29,696
- Why are you here?
- Why didn't you reply?

450
00:35:30,405 --> 00:35:31,823
- Reply to what?
- My text.

451
00:35:31,906 --> 00:35:33,783
- I did.
- And I replied to your reply.

452
00:35:33,866 --> 00:35:34,993
I'm working right now.

453
00:35:35,868 --> 00:35:37,161
Give this to me.

454
00:35:38,496 --> 00:35:40,873
We're not allowed
to check our phones while working.

455
00:35:47,005 --> 00:35:48,089
Why did you

456
00:35:49,007 --> 00:35:49,841
want to see me?

457
00:35:51,092 --> 00:35:52,594
I thought you were busy.

458
00:35:55,471 --> 00:35:56,514
What

459
00:35:57,181 --> 00:35:58,057
is it about?

460
00:36:02,353 --> 00:36:03,313
What is it?

461
00:36:04,856 --> 00:36:05,732
Well…

462
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,485
I was just wondering…

463
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:14,073
if we could meet up after work.

464
00:36:41,976 --> 00:36:43,061
I'm extremely busy.

465
00:36:44,437 --> 00:36:45,605
But I shall give up

466
00:36:46,731 --> 00:36:47,899
my precious time for you.

467
00:36:47,982 --> 00:36:49,776
It's fine. You don't have to.

468
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:50,943
I'll give you

469
00:36:51,986 --> 00:36:53,154
my precious time.

470
00:36:56,324 --> 00:36:57,367
See you later.

471
00:37:14,926 --> 00:37:17,595
- He's so cool.
- What makes you think that?

472
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:20,473
We don't have to participate
in Super Farmer Week this year.

473
00:37:20,556 --> 00:37:22,433
- Really?
- We were always made to go

474
00:37:22,517 --> 00:37:24,268
when it's the purchasing team's job.

475
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:26,979
Mr. Gu didn't approve,
saying it wasn't in our job scope.

476
00:37:28,147 --> 00:37:30,024
It feels like heaven
now that our manager changed.

477
00:37:30,108 --> 00:37:31,901
Even his name means "salvation."

478
00:37:31,984 --> 00:37:33,611
He came here to save us.

479
00:37:33,695 --> 00:37:36,364
He's our hero.

480
00:37:38,408 --> 00:37:41,244
I hope he becomes the chairman too.

481
00:37:41,327 --> 00:37:43,329
Is not participating in that event
such great news?

482
00:37:47,959 --> 00:37:49,669
You've never been, have you?

483
00:37:49,752 --> 00:37:52,088
- No.
- Then you shouldn't comment.

484
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,299
By the way,
what did you talk about with Mr. Gu?

485
00:37:55,967 --> 00:37:57,260
Did you get on his bad side?

486
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:05,184
He gave me words of encouragement.

487
00:38:05,268 --> 00:38:06,310
"You got this."

488
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,897
- "You got this"?
- Yes.

489
00:38:27,498 --> 00:38:28,332
Don't…

490
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:29,792
Don't get out.

491
00:38:31,753 --> 00:38:32,795
Why not?

492
00:38:33,337 --> 00:38:34,297
People can see us.

493
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,590
Are we committing a crime?

494
00:38:36,132 --> 00:38:37,216
No, please.

495
00:38:38,676 --> 00:38:40,344
Can you just lower your window?

496
00:38:42,221 --> 00:38:43,347
Jeez.

497
00:38:46,017 --> 00:38:47,018
What is it?

498
00:38:48,978 --> 00:38:50,062
Here.

499
00:38:53,941 --> 00:38:54,901
What is this?

500
00:38:55,902 --> 00:38:57,236
It's nothing much.

501
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,655
It's just to express my thanks
for the other day.

502
00:39:03,868 --> 00:39:05,578
You didn't need to give me anything.

503
00:39:06,746 --> 00:39:07,914
- Then give it back.
- Wait.

504
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:10,124
I appreciate your kindness.

505
00:39:11,042 --> 00:39:12,502
- So I'll accept it.
- You don't have to.

506
00:39:14,045 --> 00:39:15,129
I'll accept it.

507
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,923
Sa-rang.

508
00:39:17,423 --> 00:39:18,800
- Yes.
- Are you not going home?

509
00:39:19,467 --> 00:39:20,885
Goodbye. Take care.

510
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:28,851
Get home safe.

511
00:39:28,935 --> 00:39:30,978
You're leaving already?

512
00:39:31,062 --> 00:39:32,897
Yes. I thought you were busy.

513
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,857
You should go.
I won't waste your precious time.

514
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:39,904
Gosh.

515
00:39:41,739 --> 00:39:42,907
Let's eat.

516
00:39:44,033 --> 00:39:44,867
Sorry?

517
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:48,913
I'm hungry.

518
00:39:56,879 --> 00:39:57,713
Okay.

519
00:39:58,256 --> 00:39:59,131
I'll buy this time.

520
00:40:01,008 --> 00:40:01,926
Hurry.

521
00:40:06,722 --> 00:40:08,224
Customer number 159.

522
00:40:08,307 --> 00:40:09,642
- Yes.
- It's not us.

523
00:40:15,064 --> 00:40:16,315
What number are we?

524
00:40:16,399 --> 00:40:17,316
Just wait.

525
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:22,446
All this just for one meal?

526
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:25,116
This place is popular,
so they don't take reservations.

527
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:27,201
I've never waited for anything in my life.

528
00:40:27,785 --> 00:40:28,744
Clearly.

529
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:36,711
How good must this restaurant be
for people to line up

530
00:40:36,794 --> 00:40:38,045
and waste their time?

531
00:40:38,921 --> 00:40:41,132
For someone like me, time is--

532
00:40:41,883 --> 00:40:43,426
Let's go. We can come next time.

533
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:45,553
Why?

534
00:40:45,636 --> 00:40:47,847
I don't want to waste your precious time,

535
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:50,016
so I'll make a reservation next time.

536
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:52,226
You didn't listen to
what I had to say next.

537
00:40:53,561 --> 00:40:54,645
Suddenly…

538
00:40:55,897 --> 00:40:57,064
Suddenly,

539
00:40:58,649 --> 00:41:00,860
I became curious to know
what waiting feels like.

540
00:41:01,903 --> 00:41:03,821
I will try experiencing what it's like.

541
00:41:05,156 --> 00:41:06,657
You don't have to.

542
00:41:06,741 --> 00:41:07,783
I will,

543
00:41:08,409 --> 00:41:09,660
even if I don't have to.

544
00:41:12,288 --> 00:41:13,122
Sit down.

545
00:41:20,713 --> 00:41:23,299
I've always had to wait for everything.

546
00:41:23,966 --> 00:41:26,510
Whether it was for the bus or the taxi,
I always waited.

547
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:29,263
"When will it be my turn?"

548
00:41:29,347 --> 00:41:32,224
"What if the line cuts off
in front of me and I lose my chance?"

549
00:41:33,392 --> 00:41:34,685
But someone told me

550
00:41:35,394 --> 00:41:37,563
that the countless people waiting in line

551
00:41:37,647 --> 00:41:40,149
work for those
who never have to wait in line.

552
00:41:42,068 --> 00:41:43,986
Looking at us, I think they were right.

553
00:41:45,154 --> 00:41:48,991
Why would you segregate people
over something as trivial as lining up?

554
00:41:49,075 --> 00:41:49,992
You're so heartless.

555
00:41:51,827 --> 00:41:53,663
Customer number 161.

556
00:41:53,746 --> 00:41:55,122
It's not us.

557
00:41:55,706 --> 00:41:56,791
Oh, it <i>is </i>us.

558
00:42:05,091 --> 00:42:06,133
Is something on fire?

559
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:09,804
Have you never seen that before?

560
00:42:10,805 --> 00:42:11,973
Don't tell me

561
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:15,559
they're going to be that rowdy
when they cook our food too.

562
00:42:15,643 --> 00:42:16,769
They will. Why?

563
00:42:17,436 --> 00:42:19,105
Food should be eaten quietly.

564
00:42:19,188 --> 00:42:21,983
This place is so chaotic
and uncomfortable.

565
00:42:23,859 --> 00:42:25,736
I only come here on special occasions.

566
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,238
If you're going to whine, we can leave.

567
00:42:27,321 --> 00:42:28,155
Wait.

568
00:42:30,408 --> 00:42:31,951
It's very uncomfortable,

569
00:42:32,702 --> 00:42:33,828
but I'll suck it up.

570
00:42:35,746 --> 00:42:37,039
Are you ready to order?

571
00:42:37,665 --> 00:42:40,001
Yes, can you give us two special sets?

572
00:42:40,084 --> 00:42:42,503
- What will you have to drink?
- Louise-Conti.

573
00:42:42,586 --> 00:42:43,921
Sorry? What was that?

574
00:42:45,047 --> 00:42:45,923
Louise-Conti.

575
00:42:46,507 --> 00:42:47,591
Two draft beers, please.

576
00:42:47,675 --> 00:42:49,093
- All right.
- Thank you.

577
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,054
I'm buying tonight, so it's up to me.

578
00:42:58,728 --> 00:43:02,481
Does the beer taste better
if the mug is cold?

579
00:43:03,065 --> 00:43:06,152
People focus too much on the packaging
while neglecting the essence.

580
00:43:06,235 --> 00:43:07,528
You don't know anything.

581
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:09,488
Give it to me. I'll drink it.

582
00:43:10,031 --> 00:43:12,199
I appreciate the gesture,
so I'll drink it all.

583
00:43:13,117 --> 00:43:14,285
Are you doing me a favor?

584
00:43:14,368 --> 00:43:16,912
"I'll make time, I'll wait,
I'll suck it up for you."

585
00:43:18,622 --> 00:43:19,957
I'll also clink my mug for you.

586
00:43:21,625 --> 00:43:24,295
It is such an honor
to be able to clink mugs with you, sir.

587
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:34,013
What in the world?

588
00:43:34,722 --> 00:43:35,556
What do you think?

589
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:37,600
- Isn't it amazing?
- It's good.

590
00:43:38,184 --> 00:43:39,935
What? Why is it good?

591
00:43:54,366 --> 00:43:55,701
Why is this so good?

592
00:43:57,870 --> 00:43:59,080
Can I get a refill?

593
00:44:07,546 --> 00:44:09,215
When will our food come out?

594
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,984
You scaredy-cat.

595
00:44:29,068 --> 00:44:30,402
I wasn't scared.

596
00:44:30,986 --> 00:44:31,862
I…

597
00:44:32,363 --> 00:44:34,073
I was just acting startled

598
00:44:34,156 --> 00:44:36,325
in return for his performance.

599
00:44:36,408 --> 00:44:37,952
Yes, sure you were.

600
00:44:40,996 --> 00:44:42,414
The finger thing was slightly…

601
00:44:44,667 --> 00:44:45,835
Can we eat now?

602
00:44:45,918 --> 00:44:47,127
Yes, try it.

603
00:44:53,467 --> 00:44:54,677
Isn't it tasty?

604
00:45:16,073 --> 00:45:17,074
That…

605
00:45:21,245 --> 00:45:22,746
He made a heart.

606
00:45:23,247 --> 00:45:24,582
How in the world…

607
00:45:25,165 --> 00:45:26,792
One, two, three.

608
00:45:27,585 --> 00:45:29,712
Let me take some more pictures. One, two…

609
00:45:29,795 --> 00:45:31,046
Look, it's a heart.

610
00:45:33,048 --> 00:45:34,091
Who gets to eat it?

611
00:45:36,802 --> 00:45:38,137
What should we eat next time?

612
00:45:39,638 --> 00:45:40,848
With me?

613
00:45:40,931 --> 00:45:41,849
Then…

614
00:45:42,766 --> 00:45:43,809
is this it?

615
00:45:43,893 --> 00:45:45,936
Yes, this is it.

616
00:45:46,437 --> 00:45:47,271
Why?

617
00:45:47,897 --> 00:45:51,734
Because I feel uncomfortable
eating alone with you.

618
00:45:54,653 --> 00:45:55,571
But I don't.

619
00:45:56,739 --> 00:45:57,948
When should we meet again?

620
00:45:58,616 --> 00:45:59,909
I said I'm not going to.

621
00:45:59,992 --> 00:46:01,827
- Why not?
- Because it's uncomfortable.

622
00:46:01,911 --> 00:46:04,121
- Not for me.
- Is that all that matters?

623
00:46:05,789 --> 00:46:06,749
Fine.

624
00:46:07,541 --> 00:46:08,918
Be comfortable around me now.

625
00:46:10,294 --> 00:46:11,462
I'll allow it.

626
00:46:16,425 --> 00:46:17,259
What?

627
00:46:17,843 --> 00:46:19,428
You know how to smile?

628
00:46:22,056 --> 00:46:24,725
If you knew how to smile,
you should've smiled in Jeju.

629
00:46:27,728 --> 00:46:29,480
You're mistaken. I don't like smiling.

630
00:46:36,987 --> 00:46:38,364
How about some meat next time?

631
00:46:38,447 --> 00:46:40,157
I know an excellent restaurant.

632
00:46:41,033 --> 00:46:43,077
No, thank you.
You can go with your friends.

633
00:46:44,203 --> 00:46:45,371
I don't have any friends.

634
00:46:46,705 --> 00:46:47,706
Why not?

635
00:46:48,624 --> 00:46:50,167
Because I don't need any.

636
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:56,131
Then what do you think about pasta?

637
00:46:58,217 --> 00:47:00,094
- Well--
- Fine. I'll decide.

638
00:47:00,761 --> 00:47:01,762
Excuse me.

639
00:47:01,845 --> 00:47:04,306
- You said no to meat, so pasta.
- Can you not hear me?

640
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:06,183
- Types of pasta…
- Hello?

641
00:47:06,266 --> 00:47:07,518
-There's clam pasta,
-Hello?

642
00:47:07,601 --> 00:47:09,228
-garlic pasta,
-Can't you hear me?

643
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:12,231
- and creamy flying fish roe pasta.
- Hello? I said I'm not going.

644
00:47:12,314 --> 00:47:13,857
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm going.

645
00:47:14,358 --> 00:47:16,068
I'm going. Won't you join me?

646
00:47:26,245 --> 00:47:28,622
Were you trying to surprise me?
You came unannounced.

647
00:47:39,425 --> 00:47:40,426
Did you have dinner?

648
00:47:41,135 --> 00:47:42,302
Should I order something?

649
00:47:49,601 --> 00:47:50,644
I have something to tell you.

650
00:47:53,647 --> 00:47:54,815
Let's get divorced.

651
00:47:57,568 --> 00:47:58,944
I'm in love with someone else.

652
00:48:00,237 --> 00:48:01,530
How long will this one last?

653
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:03,866
Just have some fun.

654
00:48:03,949 --> 00:48:05,784
I'm really in love with her.

655
00:48:09,705 --> 00:48:10,706
Okay.

656
00:48:11,498 --> 00:48:12,833
Love her with all your heart.

657
00:48:13,792 --> 00:48:15,127
I'm not stopping you.

658
00:48:15,878 --> 00:48:17,046
But we can't get divorced now.

659
00:48:17,129 --> 00:48:18,505
I don't need any money.

660
00:48:18,589 --> 00:48:19,923
I just want a divorce.

661
00:48:20,007 --> 00:48:21,967
I'm at war with Won right now.

662
00:48:22,968 --> 00:48:24,970
Father hasn't chosen a successor yet.

663
00:48:25,554 --> 00:48:27,222
Don't get in my way and wait.

664
00:48:27,306 --> 00:48:29,808
I'll do what you want
after I inherit King Group.

665
00:48:30,601 --> 00:48:32,436
- Hwa-ran.
- You don't get to abandon me.

666
00:48:34,063 --> 00:48:36,106
You can't leave until I let you.

667
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:58,212
Surprise!

668
00:48:58,295 --> 00:48:59,171
What is this?

669
00:48:59,254 --> 00:49:01,715
Isn't today your wedding anniversary?

670
00:49:02,299 --> 00:49:05,010
This is my special gift
for the two of you.

671
00:49:05,094 --> 00:49:06,553
From the bottom of my heart,

672
00:49:06,637 --> 00:49:08,347
I wish you a happy anniversary!

673
00:49:10,516 --> 00:49:12,768
Thank you. You can place them inside.

674
00:49:21,443 --> 00:49:23,862
Dr. Yoon is back in Korea?

675
00:49:24,446 --> 00:49:27,282
He flew in urgently because of work,
so he couldn't contact us.

676
00:49:28,408 --> 00:49:29,868
I heard he was seeing someone.

677
00:49:30,702 --> 00:49:31,995
It's just a fling.

678
00:49:33,372 --> 00:49:34,915
Make sure word doesn't get out.

679
00:49:34,998 --> 00:49:36,458
I will. Don't worry.

680
00:49:37,417 --> 00:49:38,794
I'm not worried for your sake.

681
00:49:38,877 --> 00:49:40,546
If people start to gossip,

682
00:49:40,629 --> 00:49:43,006
we'll waste money
trying to block the articles.

683
00:49:54,852 --> 00:49:57,312
Give your approval for Super Farmer Week
by tomorrow morning.

684
00:49:57,396 --> 00:49:59,231
Didn't I tell you we're not doing that?

685
00:49:59,314 --> 00:50:01,400
Do you think you're doing them a favor?

686
00:50:02,526 --> 00:50:04,194
The employees are there to get paid.

687
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:06,155
We can make them do anything.

688
00:50:06,238 --> 00:50:09,408
Even if we pay them,
I won't make them do stuff like that.

689
00:50:11,326 --> 00:50:12,411
How heroic of you.

690
00:50:12,995 --> 00:50:15,330
You don't know
what they truly desire, do you?

691
00:50:15,414 --> 00:50:16,874
It's money.

692
00:50:16,957 --> 00:50:18,041
Nothing else.

693
00:50:18,625 --> 00:50:20,377
Quit acting up and sign the papers.

694
00:50:37,728 --> 00:50:38,770
Welcome.

695
00:50:38,854 --> 00:50:39,771
Welcome.

696
00:50:40,314 --> 00:50:41,523
Welcome.

697
00:50:43,567 --> 00:50:47,029
I'm sorry, but your dog could be
an inconvenience to other customers.

698
00:50:47,112 --> 00:50:48,947
Do you think you can hold your dog?

699
00:50:49,031 --> 00:50:51,033
I'll leave right after buying one thing.

700
00:50:51,116 --> 00:50:52,618
We ask for your understanding.

701
00:50:52,701 --> 00:50:55,078
If I have to carry Charles while I shop,

702
00:50:55,162 --> 00:50:56,955
it'll be an inconvenience for me.

703
00:50:57,039 --> 00:50:58,916
Am I the only one that has to suffer?

704
00:51:01,877 --> 00:51:03,295
It's okay, buddy.

705
00:51:03,378 --> 00:51:05,005
We'll leave after buying one thing.

706
00:51:05,714 --> 00:51:07,174
You know who she is, don't you?

707
00:51:07,257 --> 00:51:08,342
The national mom,

708
00:51:08,425 --> 00:51:10,010
actress Mo Seong-ae.

709
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:13,889
I'm sorry, but your dog
might scare the other customers.

710
00:51:13,972 --> 00:51:15,557
Please understand.

711
00:51:15,641 --> 00:51:17,100
Are you trying to start something?

712
00:51:17,684 --> 00:51:18,518
Fine.

713
00:51:18,602 --> 00:51:21,146
I normally wouldn't care
if I couldn't shop at a store,

714
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:23,232
but I will make sure to shop today!

715
00:51:28,695 --> 00:51:29,738
Oh, my.

716
00:51:31,281 --> 00:51:33,158
Ms. Gang, it's pooping!

717
00:51:38,956 --> 00:51:40,499
That feels nice, doesn't it?

718
00:51:40,582 --> 00:51:43,168
Charles, did you poop?

719
00:51:43,252 --> 00:51:44,378
Good job.

720
00:51:44,461 --> 00:51:46,546
- Let's go.
- Excuse me, ma'am.

721
00:51:47,089 --> 00:51:48,340
You have to clean it up.

722
00:51:48,924 --> 00:51:50,759
- What?
- Charles' poop.

723
00:51:51,426 --> 00:51:53,637
That's not for me to do.

724
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:56,265
You guys are here
to do that kind of stuff.

725
00:51:56,348 --> 00:52:00,394
Also, Charles' poop is clean,
so it won't smell.

726
00:52:01,311 --> 00:52:03,563
Since it doesn't smell,
can you clean it yourself?

727
00:52:03,647 --> 00:52:05,440
You're so ridiculous.

728
00:52:05,524 --> 00:52:07,442
Earlier, you didn't even let me
enter the store.

729
00:52:07,526 --> 00:52:09,528
Now you want me to clean up some poop?

730
00:52:09,611 --> 00:52:11,488
Get me the manager!

731
00:52:12,406 --> 00:52:13,365
I'm the manager.

732
00:52:13,448 --> 00:52:14,866
How convenient.

733
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:16,868
Manage the store and clean it up yourself.

734
00:52:16,952 --> 00:52:17,995
Ms. Gang, I'll do it.

735
00:52:18,078 --> 00:52:20,038
Don't. That's not our job.

736
00:52:20,956 --> 00:52:24,001
Ma'am, I'm sorry
but can you come inside and clean it up?

737
00:52:24,084 --> 00:52:25,210
Hey,

738
00:52:25,294 --> 00:52:28,714
I'm Mo Seong-ae, the national mom!

739
00:52:28,797 --> 00:52:30,007
Don't you know who I am?

740
00:52:30,799 --> 00:52:31,967
Hey, where are you going?

741
00:52:32,801 --> 00:52:34,177
What are you doing?

742
00:52:35,887 --> 00:52:38,181
Hey, why would you clean that up?

743
00:52:38,265 --> 00:52:40,726
Didn't I tell you
to know when to get involved?

744
00:52:40,809 --> 00:52:42,728
People are watching. Compose yourself.

745
00:52:43,312 --> 00:52:44,813
If someone posts this online,

746
00:52:44,896 --> 00:52:46,315
you'll come under fire again.

747
00:52:46,398 --> 00:52:50,652
I'm telling you, it's the lowlifes
that go on more power trips these days.

748
00:52:51,236 --> 00:52:53,488
I'll let this go
since I'm a kind, simple person.

749
00:52:53,572 --> 00:52:56,491
Consider yourself lucky
for meeting someone like me.

750
00:52:56,575 --> 00:52:58,285
I'm never coming here again!

751
00:52:58,368 --> 00:52:59,411
How ridiculous.

752
00:53:00,495 --> 00:53:01,913
Goodbye.

753
00:53:02,581 --> 00:53:05,917
Should I get a bag of salt
and throw it at her?

754
00:53:07,169 --> 00:53:08,211
Forget it.

755
00:53:08,295 --> 00:53:11,381
We just got unlucky.
Let's get over it with some spicy food.

756
00:53:11,465 --> 00:53:13,383
- Goodness.
- What should we eat?

757
00:53:16,386 --> 00:53:17,804
What's good here?

758
00:53:17,888 --> 00:53:20,057
That dish is the most popular these days.

759
00:53:21,224 --> 00:53:22,434
RECOMMENDED BY NATIONAL MOM, MO SEONG-AE

760
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:27,689
I'm sorry. We'll come back next time.

761
00:53:27,773 --> 00:53:29,983
- Let's go.
- We ate before coming here.

762
00:53:30,067 --> 00:53:31,151
Sorry.

763
00:53:36,156 --> 00:53:38,367
Do we really have to do this?

764
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:39,785
It's our job.

765
00:53:39,868 --> 00:53:41,495
Just do as you're told.

766
00:53:41,995 --> 00:53:43,413
That's what the junior members do.

767
00:53:43,955 --> 00:53:44,956
I'm going to go rest,

768
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:48,752
so you better call
every single number on this list.

769
00:53:49,753 --> 00:53:50,921
Yes, sir.

770
00:54:12,526 --> 00:54:15,654
Hello, this is Cheon Sa-rang
from King Hotel.

771
00:54:16,154 --> 00:54:17,406
How have you been?

772
00:54:18,365 --> 00:54:21,284
I'm just checking in
because I haven't seen you in a while.

773
00:54:21,868 --> 00:54:22,911
No, not at all.

774
00:54:23,662 --> 00:54:26,915
I should thank you
for always saying such lovely things.

775
00:54:26,998 --> 00:54:29,584
All right then.
Please stop by when you get a chance.

776
00:54:30,168 --> 00:54:31,586
Thank you.

777
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:38,260
Hello, this is Cheon Sa-rang
from King Hotel.

778
00:54:38,343 --> 00:54:39,428
It's been a while.

779
00:54:39,511 --> 00:54:40,512
Hello.

780
00:54:40,595 --> 00:54:42,222
Good afternoon.

781
00:54:42,305 --> 00:54:43,723
This is Cheon Sa-rang from King Hotel.

782
00:54:44,307 --> 00:54:47,602
I'm just checking in
to ask you to stop by sometime.

783
00:54:49,187 --> 00:54:51,440
All right. I'll see you next time.

784
00:54:51,523 --> 00:54:52,607
Thank you.

785
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:00,949
Hello, sir.

786
00:55:01,032 --> 00:55:02,242
What are you doing?

787
00:55:02,951 --> 00:55:05,328
- Sorry?
- Who were you calling?

788
00:55:07,289 --> 00:55:09,666
I was calling VIP guests
to check in on them.

789
00:55:09,749 --> 00:55:11,835
You went out of your way
to call them yourself?

790
00:55:12,961 --> 00:55:14,546
Is this because of the incentive?

791
00:55:15,172 --> 00:55:16,465
It's just some extra money.

792
00:55:17,841 --> 00:55:19,468
I was just following orders

793
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:21,887
to manage the VIP guests
in order to increase sales.

794
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:24,055
What orders? Who ordered you to do that?

795
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:25,849
And even so,

796
00:55:26,558 --> 00:55:27,934
shouldn't you keep your dignity intact?

797
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:31,062
I could ask you the same thing.

798
00:55:31,146 --> 00:55:33,148
As the person in charge,
you could've helped

799
00:55:33,231 --> 00:55:35,066
instead of insulting me for working hard.

800
00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:37,903
Watching you suck up to people like this

801
00:55:37,986 --> 00:55:39,362
is even more insulting.

802
00:55:41,448 --> 00:55:43,200
I'm not sucking up to them.

803
00:55:43,283 --> 00:55:44,784
I'm just doing my job.

804
00:55:44,868 --> 00:55:45,702
Your job?

805
00:55:47,621 --> 00:55:49,122
You're in the operations team.

806
00:55:49,706 --> 00:55:52,334
How commendable of you
to help out with sales too.

807
00:56:04,262 --> 00:56:07,766
HEAD MANAGER GU WON

808
00:56:10,852 --> 00:56:11,686
Mr. Gu?

809
00:56:13,813 --> 00:56:15,899
Do all employees do their job like that?

810
00:56:16,566 --> 00:56:17,484
What do you mean?

811
00:56:17,567 --> 00:56:19,236
Calling guests one by one

812
00:56:19,319 --> 00:56:20,904
and laughing on the phone, saying,

813
00:56:20,987 --> 00:56:22,989
"Please stop by, sir."

814
00:56:24,366 --> 00:56:25,617
How outrageous.

815
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:27,077
They work that hard?

816
00:56:28,161 --> 00:56:30,247
I guess the big bonus
was a good incentive.

817
00:56:30,330 --> 00:56:31,957
How do you call that working?

818
00:56:34,042 --> 00:56:35,585
Was it Super Farmer Week?

819
00:56:36,461 --> 00:56:37,629
Send the employees.

820
00:56:38,713 --> 00:56:39,798
I thought you weren't going to.

821
00:56:39,881 --> 00:56:42,217
It seems I was a villain, not a hero.

822
00:56:42,926 --> 00:56:45,679
I should help seeing how
they all just want to make money.

823
00:56:46,721 --> 00:56:47,556
You can proceed.

824
00:56:47,639 --> 00:56:49,391
Good thinking, sir.

825
00:56:49,975 --> 00:56:51,268
Losing is winning.

826
00:56:51,852 --> 00:56:54,104
If you continue to listen to me,

827
00:56:54,187 --> 00:56:55,939
everything will be as easy as pie.

828
00:56:56,022 --> 00:56:57,023
Like this.

829
00:57:00,735 --> 00:57:01,778
I shall proceed.

830
00:57:07,742 --> 00:57:09,119
That annoying mouth of his…

831
00:57:09,202 --> 00:57:10,203
Attention, everyone.

832
00:57:12,581 --> 00:57:14,165
It has been decided

833
00:57:14,249 --> 00:57:16,126
that we'll be attending Super Farmer Week.

834
00:57:18,545 --> 00:57:20,839
- Pardon?
- I thought we weren't going to this year.

835
00:57:20,922 --> 00:57:22,340
He must've approved in the end.

836
00:57:22,924 --> 00:57:24,926
Since it's been decided,
let's make it quick.

837
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:27,512
Discuss the locations
among yourselves and let me know.

838
00:57:27,596 --> 00:57:29,431
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

839
00:57:29,514 --> 00:57:30,390
Hang in there!

840
00:57:31,016 --> 00:57:32,183
- Yes, ma'am!
- Yes, ma'am!

841
00:57:40,609 --> 00:57:42,861
He acted like he cared in front of us.

842
00:57:43,778 --> 00:57:45,155
Was it all an act?

843
00:57:45,238 --> 00:57:48,116
I knew it. He looks like the type
to stab people in the back.

844
00:57:48,783 --> 00:57:51,244
A person's face
says everything about their character.

845
00:57:51,745 --> 00:57:53,371
There's nothing we can do about it.

846
00:57:53,997 --> 00:57:55,081
Let's get ready.

847
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:10,847
I'll pick first.

848
00:58:10,931 --> 00:58:12,015
Any objections?

849
00:58:18,271 --> 00:58:19,856
I didn't get to pick.

850
00:58:21,149 --> 00:58:22,984
You have no choice.

851
00:58:23,068 --> 00:58:24,027
You're ginseng.

852
00:58:25,111 --> 00:58:25,987
Ginseng?

853
00:58:26,071 --> 00:58:29,908
It's the most important location,
so make sure to dress nicely.

854
00:58:29,991 --> 00:58:33,244
You have to give him
the present in person.

855
00:58:33,328 --> 00:58:34,996
Take a change of clothes with you.

856
00:58:36,081 --> 00:58:37,290
All right.

857
00:58:41,211 --> 00:58:43,964
The Super Farmer Week schedule is set.

858
00:58:44,047 --> 00:58:46,800
Royal walnuts and dried black persimmon
will leave on Wednesday.

859
00:58:46,883 --> 00:58:50,679
Tongyeong oysters, Wando abalones,
and wild ginseng left today.

860
00:58:50,762 --> 00:58:51,846
Already?

861
00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:53,723
They're late because you took so long.

862
00:58:56,184 --> 00:58:57,936
SUPER FARMER WEEK SCHEDULE

863
00:58:59,771 --> 00:59:02,399
MOUNT JIRI, CHEON SA-RANG

864
00:59:17,330 --> 00:59:18,873
<i>This is absurd.</i>

865
00:59:19,541 --> 00:59:21,459
She has to take the night bus from Seoul

866
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:23,628
and arrive in Gurye at 4:40 a.m.

867
00:59:24,254 --> 00:59:27,549
From there, she needs to ride the bus
for another hour and 20 minutes

868
00:59:27,632 --> 00:59:29,926
to get to the house
of the master ginseng digger at 7 a.m.

869
00:59:30,010 --> 00:59:31,511
She has to greet them,

870
00:59:31,594 --> 00:59:33,972
do house chores,
take promotional pictures,

871
00:59:34,055 --> 00:59:36,224
ride the last bus
and arrive in Seoul at 1 a.m.,

872
00:59:36,307 --> 00:59:37,892
- then come to work in the morning?
- Yes.

873
00:59:37,976 --> 00:59:40,478
She has to go all the way there
and come back in a day

874
00:59:40,562 --> 00:59:41,980
without getting any sleep?

875
00:59:42,063 --> 00:59:43,523
She can sleep on the bus.

876
00:59:43,606 --> 00:59:45,942
What's so great about this event

877
00:59:46,026 --> 00:59:47,736
to work people to the bone?

878
00:59:48,445 --> 00:59:49,988
You're the one who approved it.

879
00:59:52,115 --> 00:59:54,075
They'll be getting paid 200,000 won,

880
00:59:54,159 --> 00:59:56,077
so no one's going to complain.

881
01:00:13,178 --> 01:00:16,723
WILD GINSENG

882
01:00:20,518 --> 01:00:21,895
It looks like bellflower root.

883
01:00:30,028 --> 01:00:32,363
<i>Have a safe trip.</i>

884
01:00:41,247 --> 01:00:42,874
<i>Take a day off if you need to.</i>

885
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:50,090
<i>Are you on your way there?</i>

886
01:00:55,929 --> 01:00:58,932
Why do you keep erasing what you typed?

887
01:00:59,432 --> 01:01:02,227
If you're that worried, just call her.

888
01:01:02,811 --> 01:01:04,104
What?

889
01:01:04,187 --> 01:01:05,522
What are you talking about?

890
01:01:05,605 --> 01:01:07,398
I'm not texting anyone right now.

891
01:01:07,482 --> 01:01:09,609
I know. So you should just call her.

892
01:01:11,778 --> 01:01:12,987
Just focus on driving.

893
01:01:13,571 --> 01:01:14,739
That's what I'm doing.

894
01:01:15,865 --> 01:01:16,950
Where's the honorific?

895
01:01:17,033 --> 01:01:18,034
I'll make a left, sir.

896
01:01:40,890 --> 01:01:41,975
Is anyone home?

897
01:01:46,146 --> 01:01:47,438
Can I help you?

898
01:01:49,649 --> 01:01:50,650
Goodness.

899
01:01:51,484 --> 01:01:54,445
Hello, I'm here from King Hotel.

900
01:01:54,529 --> 01:01:55,697
I see.

901
01:01:56,531 --> 01:01:57,907
The old man's not here.

902
01:01:57,991 --> 01:01:59,701
Here. I'll give it to him.

903
01:01:59,784 --> 01:02:01,244
I have to give it to him myself.

904
01:02:01,870 --> 01:02:02,996
There's no point.

905
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:06,583
You won't be able to
get around to him with this stuff.

906
01:02:09,627 --> 01:02:12,505
We've had hotel employees
from the entire nation come visit us.

907
01:02:12,589 --> 01:02:13,590
But what's the point?

908
01:02:13,673 --> 01:02:18,052
My old man refuses to meet anyone
to remain loyal to First Royal Hotel.

909
01:02:19,137 --> 01:02:20,889
I'll put in a good word for you.

910
01:02:20,972 --> 01:02:23,391
Rest here for a bit,
then head back to Seoul.

911
01:02:23,474 --> 01:02:24,601
No, it's okay.

912
01:02:24,684 --> 01:02:27,061
Do you happen to know
where your husband is?

913
01:02:27,145 --> 01:02:28,438
He's in the mountains.

914
01:02:28,521 --> 01:02:31,566
Once he goes up there,
I never know when he'll come back.

915
01:02:32,275 --> 01:02:35,612
I'd still like to meet him and say hello.

916
01:02:37,071 --> 01:02:38,531
You're pretty stubborn.

917
01:02:39,324 --> 01:02:41,117
Then are you willing to hike?

918
01:02:41,701 --> 01:02:42,535
Which way do I go?

919
01:02:43,328 --> 01:02:47,373
If you go straight up that path,
you'll see a small shack.

920
01:02:47,457 --> 01:02:49,542
You'll be able to find him
anywhere near there.

921
01:02:52,086 --> 01:02:54,589
Then how long of a walk is it?

922
01:02:55,173 --> 01:02:56,216
It's super close.

923
01:02:56,716 --> 01:02:58,676
But are you going in those shoes?

924
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:00,970
No, I brought another pair.
Everything's in here.

925
01:03:01,679 --> 01:03:04,140
- You can get changed in there.
- Thank you.

926
01:03:35,171 --> 01:03:36,381
She said it was close.

927
01:03:36,965 --> 01:03:38,925
I've been hiking for two hours.
Where is he?

928
01:03:41,010 --> 01:03:43,304
WEATHER MAP

929
01:03:47,475 --> 01:03:49,727
- Is it going to rain today?
- The forecast says so.

930
01:03:50,228 --> 01:03:52,105
But mountain and seaside weather
is so unpredictable.

931
01:03:52,188 --> 01:03:54,857
It says severe thunderstorms
and strong gusts of wind.

932
01:03:55,692 --> 01:03:57,318
Aren't the mountains too dangerous?

933
01:03:58,569 --> 01:04:02,115
It's funny how you're worried
when you're the one who sent her there.

934
01:04:02,198 --> 01:04:03,700
Who's worried?

935
01:04:04,367 --> 01:04:05,743
If not, never mind.

936
01:04:06,327 --> 01:04:08,204
I'm looking at today's sales trends.

937
01:04:08,288 --> 01:04:10,540
- You don't need to see it, do you?
- No, I don't.

938
01:04:10,623 --> 01:04:13,042
There's a government policy seminar.
You won't attend, right?

939
01:04:13,126 --> 01:04:14,210
No, I won't.

940
01:04:14,294 --> 01:04:16,170
You're worried sick
about Ms. Sa-rang, right?

941
01:04:16,254 --> 01:04:17,338
Of course I am.

942
01:04:19,465 --> 01:04:21,134
- What?
- You're so into her.

943
01:04:22,385 --> 01:04:25,722
You should be treating her nicely.
Why are you so testy around her?

944
01:04:25,805 --> 01:04:27,765
I don't like her.

945
01:04:27,849 --> 01:04:29,267
You're giving me a headache. Get out.

946
01:04:35,315 --> 01:04:36,190
By the way,

947
01:04:36,274 --> 01:04:38,776
there's only a 30% chance of rain today.

948
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:41,362
So please stop worrying for no reason.

949
01:04:54,542 --> 01:04:55,585
Gosh. What the…

950
01:04:56,461 --> 01:04:57,545
What?

951
01:04:58,629 --> 01:04:59,464
Darn it.

952
01:05:00,965 --> 01:05:01,924
What the heck?

953
01:05:03,343 --> 01:05:04,844
What now?

954
01:05:10,308 --> 01:05:12,018
HEAD MANAGER GU

955
01:05:13,061 --> 01:05:14,395
Yes, Mr. Gu.

956
01:05:14,479 --> 01:05:16,689
Don't get me wrong.
I'm just checking in as your manager.

957
01:05:17,690 --> 01:05:19,776
- Where are you?
- In the mountains.

958
01:05:22,945 --> 01:05:24,072
It's not raining, is it?

959
01:05:24,155 --> 01:05:25,323
Oh, gosh!

960
01:05:28,826 --> 01:05:29,869
It is raining.

961
01:05:31,829 --> 01:05:32,789
Hike back down.

962
01:05:34,582 --> 01:05:36,834
I will after giving him
the gift in person.

963
01:05:36,918 --> 01:05:38,503
Get down right now.

964
01:05:38,586 --> 01:05:40,129
Why did you go up there when it's raining?

965
01:05:40,213 --> 01:05:41,714
<i>Are you out of your mind?</i>

966
01:05:42,507 --> 01:05:44,467
You're the one who sent me here.

967
01:05:46,719 --> 01:05:48,596
I'll head back after I finish.

968
01:05:48,679 --> 01:05:50,890
<i>I don't care
about the ginseng or whatever.</i>

969
01:05:50,973 --> 01:05:52,183
<i>Just get down from there.</i>

970
01:05:54,644 --> 01:05:55,478
Hang on.

971
01:05:56,062 --> 01:05:57,146
<i>What is it?</i>

972
01:05:57,980 --> 01:05:59,065
Hold on a second.

973
01:05:59,649 --> 01:06:00,691
<i>What is it?</i>

974
01:06:01,317 --> 01:06:02,235
<i>What's going on?</i>

975
01:06:05,029 --> 01:06:05,947
My goodness! Wait.

976
01:06:13,329 --> 01:06:14,747
HEAD MANAGER GU

977
01:06:27,844 --> 01:06:28,845
No way.

978
01:06:42,108 --> 01:06:45,027
HEAD MANAGER GU

979
01:07:04,257 --> 01:07:06,718
HEAD MANAGER GU

980
01:07:36,706 --> 01:07:37,874
Am I alive?

981
01:07:40,543 --> 01:07:42,379
Oh no.

982
01:07:42,462 --> 01:07:43,588
What do I do?

983
01:07:47,050 --> 01:07:48,093
Hello?

984
01:07:48,677 --> 01:07:50,095
Is anyone there?

985
01:07:51,221 --> 01:07:53,598
There's a person down here. Please help!

986
01:07:57,769 --> 01:07:58,812
Oh no.

987
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:09,531
I'll either starve or freeze to death.

988
01:08:11,825 --> 01:08:14,202
Is this it for me?

989
01:08:27,215 --> 01:08:29,718
They say you'll look good in the afterlife
if you ate well in life.

990
01:08:30,301 --> 01:08:32,095
I can't tell if this is ginseng or not.

991
01:08:53,616 --> 01:08:54,659
What was that?

992
01:08:55,660 --> 01:08:56,786
I'm scared.

993
01:08:58,079 --> 01:08:59,497
Am I going to die?

994
01:09:04,335 --> 01:09:05,587
What do I do?

995
01:09:06,463 --> 01:09:09,048
I'm scared, Grandma.

996
01:10:14,906 --> 01:10:17,909

998
01:10:51,442 --> 01:10:52,277
<i>Thank you.</i>

999
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:53,444
<i>It was me!</i>

1000
01:10:53,528 --> 01:10:54,904
<i>I saved her!</i>

1001
01:10:54,988 --> 01:10:56,614
Why should you two eat when I saved her?

1002
01:10:57,407 --> 01:10:58,783
<i>Follow me.</i>

1003
01:10:58,867 --> 01:11:00,702
- You've peeled onions before, right?
- Me?

1004
01:11:00,785 --> 01:11:02,245
<i>Just do as I say.</i>

1005
01:11:02,954 --> 01:11:04,414
<i>My gosh! What are you doing there?</i>

1006
01:11:04,497 --> 01:11:06,082
<i>It's me, Gu Won.</i>

1007
01:11:06,165 --> 01:11:07,041
Help.

1008
01:11:07,125 --> 01:11:10,920
You're too old
to be living off your father.

1009
01:11:11,004 --> 01:11:12,630
Do you have
a housing subscription account?

1010
01:11:14,090 --> 01:11:15,133
<i>Are you hurt?</i>

1011
01:11:15,216 --> 01:11:16,384
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1012
01:11:16,467 --> 01:11:17,427
<i>I said I'd protect you.</i>

1013
01:11:20,847 --> 01:11:21,890
<i>I'll let you take me.</i>

1014
01:11:23,474 --> 01:11:24,517
<i>It's a date.</i>
