1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
KING THE LAND

2
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:17,785
Wild geese live for over 100 years

3
00:00:17,868 --> 00:00:22,456
and never abandon their partner
once they are mated.

4
00:00:23,082 --> 00:00:26,835
They are a symbol of eternal love.

5
00:00:33,092 --> 00:00:35,678
ONE HOUR AGO

6
00:00:40,724 --> 00:00:42,685
What do you think? Don't I look great?

7
00:00:42,768 --> 00:00:44,186
Sure, you do.

8
00:00:45,396 --> 00:00:46,939
But less than the man of the hour.

9
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,402
Let's see.

10
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:55,572
There it is.

11
00:00:57,074 --> 00:00:58,242
Looks great.

12
00:00:58,325 --> 00:00:59,952
- I'll take this.
- This?

13
00:01:00,035 --> 00:01:01,078
Yes, this one.

14
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:02,454
That obviously looks very humble.

15
00:01:02,538 --> 00:01:03,706
It suits you perfectly.

16
00:01:05,124 --> 00:01:06,250
You have no idea.

17
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:09,211
The Korean people were known
as the white-clad folks.

18
00:01:09,295 --> 00:01:10,963
So for our biggest celebrations,

19
00:01:11,046 --> 00:01:14,216
the most honored person
would put on a white garment

20
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,176
and carry out the most important job.

21
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,470
Of course, that'll be me today.

22
00:01:18,554 --> 00:01:20,973
I'm the most noble and honored man here!

23
00:01:21,056 --> 00:01:22,141
Yes, I know that.

24
00:01:22,224 --> 00:01:23,809
So put that on and do your thing.

25
00:01:23,892 --> 00:01:25,894
I'll put this on and do my thing.

26
00:01:26,562 --> 00:01:27,813
Stop!

27
00:01:27,896 --> 00:01:29,148
Give me those clothes.

28
00:01:30,816 --> 00:01:33,319
I can't put you up
for something as important as this.

29
00:01:34,403 --> 00:01:35,571
You can't handle it.

30
00:01:35,654 --> 00:01:37,990
The clothes are mine,
and that job is mine too.

31
00:01:38,073 --> 00:01:39,742
Hand it to me. That's an order!

32
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:47,416
I'm the most noble and honored.

33
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:49,710
Sa-rang.

34
00:01:54,506 --> 00:01:58,427
The bride and groom
will share their wedding drinks.

35
00:02:07,353 --> 00:02:11,565
Bride and groom,
hold up your cups respectfully

36
00:02:11,649 --> 00:02:13,108
and have your drinks.

37
00:02:23,619 --> 00:02:25,037
What?

38
00:02:26,455 --> 00:02:27,289
Hey!

39
00:02:28,957 --> 00:02:30,292
You're here.

40
00:02:30,376 --> 00:02:31,377
Why are you there?

41
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,545
You wanted to switch. You gave the order.

42
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:35,297
You said this was important!

43
00:02:35,381 --> 00:02:36,673
How dare you deceive me?

44
00:02:37,383 --> 00:02:39,176
There's nothing more important

45
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:41,178
than sweeping the yards
to make the place clean

46
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:43,138
for our guests on this special day.

47
00:02:43,222 --> 00:02:45,307
- You!
- What?

48
00:02:45,391 --> 00:02:47,184
- You, come here!
- No, you come.

49
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,435
I'm coming!

50
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:49,686
- Okay.
- Hey!

51
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,979
Get back here. Stop!

52
00:02:51,063 --> 00:02:53,273
What are you going to do?

53
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:55,359
Sa-rang, you're beautiful.

54
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:56,652
- You.
- Hey.

55
00:02:57,236 --> 00:02:59,655
- Get back here.
- You can come back later.

56
00:02:59,738 --> 00:03:01,448
How dare you deceive me?

57
00:03:03,117 --> 00:03:04,618
Hey!

58
00:03:04,701 --> 00:03:06,870
You!

59
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,836
EPISODE 8

60
00:03:21,552 --> 00:03:23,637
Why did you agree to something
you didn't want to do?

61
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,640
I'm here on behalf of the hotel.

62
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:31,186
I couldn't allow any damage to it
because of my personal wants.

63
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,272
It wasn't easy to get this contract.

64
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:38,235
I still didn't like it.

65
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,239
- What do you mean?
- You and him doing that.

66
00:03:42,781 --> 00:03:43,907
I didn't want to see it.

67
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:47,828
Wait, are you jealous?

68
00:03:49,204 --> 00:03:50,122
Why would I be?

69
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:54,585
Only losers
with zero confidence get jealous.

70
00:03:55,627 --> 00:03:56,670
Which means

71
00:03:56,754 --> 00:03:59,381
that's far from something I would do.

72
00:04:01,425 --> 00:04:02,926
- Then why?
- Just because.

73
00:04:04,052 --> 00:04:06,054
I didn't like seeing you with another man.

74
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:10,851
That's called jealousy.

75
00:04:11,643 --> 00:04:12,978
It wasn't.

76
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:15,147
Do you know what he's like?

77
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,649
He's probably dated well over 100 women.

78
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:19,318
- He's probably married too.
- Wow.

79
00:04:19,401 --> 00:04:20,778
Two, three… no, four times.

80
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,613
Wow, really?

81
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:24,239
You can't be with other guys,

82
00:04:24,782 --> 00:04:26,408
but especially not him.

83
00:04:26,492 --> 00:04:28,368
Never. Not at all.

84
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:31,538
Okay.

85
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:35,584
Then let's say it wasn't jealousy.

86
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:38,337
But something like jealousy.

87
00:04:39,421 --> 00:04:40,422
It wasn't.

88
00:04:40,506 --> 00:04:42,007
I wasn't jealous.

89
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,759
Yes, that's what I said.

90
00:04:49,473 --> 00:04:50,557
Anyway,

91
00:04:50,641 --> 00:04:53,185
you acted very wisely today.

92
00:04:53,268 --> 00:04:55,229
I was worried
everything was going to fall through.

93
00:04:56,647 --> 00:04:58,607
I'm here on behalf of the hotel.

94
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,151
I may be a jerk who only does as I please,

95
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:02,528
but work is still work.

96
00:05:04,947 --> 00:05:06,240
Since when?

97
00:05:08,992 --> 00:05:10,202
From now on.

98
00:05:10,786 --> 00:05:11,703
Why?

99
00:05:12,955 --> 00:05:14,414
I want to protect something.

100
00:05:17,292 --> 00:05:19,336
I'll protect it at all costs.

101
00:05:20,504 --> 00:05:21,713
And to do that,

102
00:05:22,673 --> 00:05:23,924
I'll build up my power.

103
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:35,644
Are you going to work out?

104
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:39,523
No, I already look great.

105
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:41,108
- Oh my.
- Why should I?

106
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,903
Where do you find such confidence?

107
00:05:46,321 --> 00:05:47,364
I was

108
00:05:48,323 --> 00:05:49,783
only sharing facts.

109
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,246
I truly apologize for not realizing that.

110
00:06:13,265 --> 00:06:15,851
Why are you staring at me like that?

111
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,354
Because I love it.

112
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,315
What?

113
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,275
Love.

114
00:06:32,451 --> 00:06:33,785
I'm saying I love everything.

115
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:36,413
Well, the weather

116
00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:38,582
and the wind.

117
00:06:42,085 --> 00:06:43,378
The weather.

118
00:06:44,296 --> 00:06:46,214
Yes, the weather is wonderful today.

119
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:50,260
What great weather.

120
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:00,187
Hey!

121
00:07:06,401 --> 00:07:08,528
How dare you ruin my sacred wedding?

122
00:07:08,612 --> 00:07:10,113
You made a fool out of my love!

123
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:11,031
Love?

124
00:07:11,114 --> 00:07:12,407
Love, my foot.

125
00:07:12,491 --> 00:07:15,035
You said you've dated
over 100 women until now.

126
00:07:15,118 --> 00:07:16,995
And you were married twice.
Or was it thrice?

127
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:18,622
It's not a crime to be popular.

128
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:20,457
Though someone as unpopular as you

129
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,334
would never know.

130
00:07:23,418 --> 00:07:24,670
I'm popular enough.

131
00:07:24,753 --> 00:07:26,672
I just chose not to date people.

132
00:07:26,755 --> 00:07:30,425
A woman-chaser like you
can't even comprehend how popular I am.

133
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:33,804
You're quite proud for a penniless pauper.

134
00:07:34,763 --> 00:07:36,723
- How much do you have?
- A whole lot.

135
00:07:36,807 --> 00:07:37,849
Excuse me.

136
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,727
If you two are going to fight,
I'm going home.

137
00:07:43,522 --> 00:07:45,065
We aren't fighting, Sa-rang.

138
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,693
We aren't. We're just warning each other.

139
00:07:49,027 --> 00:07:50,988
I'm warning you.

140
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:53,824
You're banned from being
within a 100 m radius of Ms. Cheon.

141
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:55,534
Got it? Go.

142
00:07:55,617 --> 00:07:58,120
Did you forget about the contract?
I'm the one who gives orders.

143
00:07:58,203 --> 00:07:59,496
Get rid of him!

144
00:08:01,164 --> 00:08:02,624
What? Get rid of me?

145
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,251
- Yes, you.
- You think that's possible?

146
00:08:04,334 --> 00:08:05,293
You… Oh.

147
00:08:05,377 --> 00:08:06,795
- Get rid of me?
- Yes.

148
00:08:06,878 --> 00:08:07,838
Go quickly.

149
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:09,214
You can't get rid of me!

150
00:08:09,297 --> 00:08:11,091
Let go! Wait, you're really doing this.

151
00:08:11,174 --> 00:08:13,760
Man, I'm walking on air.

152
00:08:15,637 --> 00:08:16,471
Finally.

153
00:08:17,222 --> 00:08:18,515
It's the two of us.

154
00:08:19,057 --> 00:08:19,891
Yes.

155
00:08:19,975 --> 00:08:21,643
Let's take a walk, Sa-rang.

156
00:08:22,394 --> 00:08:23,520
All right.

157
00:08:36,366 --> 00:08:38,535
Isn't it tough
to wait on guests for a living?

158
00:08:40,328 --> 00:08:41,621
Of course it's tough.

159
00:08:42,205 --> 00:08:45,792
It's not always easy
to serve every guest with a smile.

160
00:08:45,876 --> 00:08:47,002
I'll give you a hotel.

161
00:08:47,711 --> 00:08:48,587
Pardon?

162
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,796
I have lots.

163
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,631
You can choose whichever one you like.

164
00:08:51,715 --> 00:08:53,759
Then you won't have to live
such a tough life.

165
00:08:54,718 --> 00:08:56,386
It's all right, really.

166
00:08:57,387 --> 00:09:00,182
It may be tough, but I still love my job.

167
00:09:00,724 --> 00:09:02,642
It'll be even better if you own a hotel.

168
00:09:04,102 --> 00:09:06,646
What I want to do
isn't business management.

169
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:10,984
I want to provide a happy day
for every guest we have.

170
00:09:12,277 --> 00:09:15,822
It's a special thing
to present happiness to someone.

171
00:09:16,406 --> 00:09:18,617
And it's not something just anyone can do.

172
00:09:29,711 --> 00:09:31,088
You're such a wonderful woman.

173
00:09:32,214 --> 00:09:33,340
I knew it.

174
00:09:33,423 --> 00:09:34,925
I have a good eye for people.

175
00:09:35,801 --> 00:09:37,385
I must have a party!

176
00:09:37,469 --> 00:09:39,096
Party time!

177
00:09:40,806 --> 00:09:41,848
Sure.

178
00:09:51,108 --> 00:09:52,109
Go inside.

179
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:54,569
I had a wonderful day thanks to you.

180
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:57,030
Sa-rang, see you tomorrow.

181
00:09:57,864 --> 00:09:58,865
Yes, Your Highness.

182
00:10:05,455 --> 00:10:07,332
Don't you think that smile was too big?

183
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,920
It's finally over.

184
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:15,048
Great work today, Mr. Gu.

185
00:10:15,132 --> 00:10:16,091
Great work.

186
00:10:26,351 --> 00:10:27,185
Put these on.

187
00:10:28,812 --> 00:10:29,729
I'm all right.

188
00:10:29,813 --> 00:10:32,023
You dragged those around all day
without a break.

189
00:10:32,607 --> 00:10:34,192
Don't you feel bad for your feet?

190
00:10:34,276 --> 00:10:36,069
Show some kindness and let them rest.

191
00:10:51,293 --> 00:10:53,003
You're acting like
you did something wrong.

192
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:54,671
What if someone sees me?

193
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:56,464
No one will, so calm down.

194
00:11:01,011 --> 00:11:02,053
What are you doing?

195
00:11:03,513 --> 00:11:04,764
You can sleep here tonight.

196
00:11:10,729 --> 00:11:12,022
Sleep here?

197
00:11:34,836 --> 00:11:37,422
Great work escorting that headache

198
00:11:37,505 --> 00:11:39,466
and working overtime
on behalf of our hotel.

199
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:43,511
He may be our VIP guest,
but you're our VVIP employee.

200
00:11:44,554 --> 00:11:46,431
You deserve to stay here tonight.

201
00:11:48,433 --> 00:11:49,893
Don't turn it down.

202
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,564
I won't. Thank you.

203
00:12:05,367 --> 00:12:07,494
You must be hungry.
Order some room service.

204
00:12:07,577 --> 00:12:09,204
Eat whatever you want

205
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:10,789
and rest up.

206
00:12:12,582 --> 00:12:13,875
This is an employee benefit.

207
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:16,336
Okay.

208
00:12:18,421 --> 00:12:19,506
Good night.

209
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:39,109
Mr. Gu.

210
00:13:04,792 --> 00:13:06,627
I told you to order room service,

211
00:13:06,711 --> 00:13:08,171
but you choose instant noodles?

212
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:09,964
The best late-night snack
is instant noodles.

213
00:13:10,048 --> 00:13:11,090
You don't know, do you?

214
00:13:11,174 --> 00:13:13,134
What do you take me for?

215
00:13:13,217 --> 00:13:14,260
Of course I do.

216
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:17,764
- Really?
- Yes, really.

217
00:13:19,807 --> 00:13:20,767
In that case,

218
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:22,643
I choose this.

219
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:30,735
To think we came all the way
to the Han River for raw instant noodles.

220
00:13:32,695 --> 00:13:34,822
You really don't know a thing.

221
00:13:35,406 --> 00:13:38,618
If you're at the Han River,
you've got to have this one.

222
00:13:38,701 --> 00:13:40,912
Read this. "The original cup noodles."

223
00:14:04,352 --> 00:14:05,395
Is it that good?

224
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:06,604
I think

225
00:14:07,563 --> 00:14:08,648
I simply must

226
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:11,734
get that machine in my room.

227
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:12,652
Come on.

228
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,946
Then it wouldn't taste like this.

229
00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:16,322
It only tastes this good

230
00:14:16,406 --> 00:14:18,991
when you throw in this soft river breeze

231
00:14:19,075 --> 00:14:22,120
and that dazzling night view.

232
00:14:22,203 --> 00:14:23,538
That's key.

233
00:14:24,038 --> 00:14:26,874
At times, I come here
for instant noodles and beer after work.

234
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,209
It tastes like heaven.

235
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:30,545
Hey.

236
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:33,589
You kept this awesome attraction
all to yourself?

237
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:36,217
You're more selfish than I thought.

238
00:14:37,969 --> 00:14:41,180
Do you have to criticize me that much
over some instant noodles?

239
00:14:41,264 --> 00:14:42,598
"Some instant noodles"?

240
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:45,143
These are the best instant noodles
I've ever had.

241
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:47,645
They're so good.

242
00:14:47,728 --> 00:14:48,980
I'm glad.

243
00:14:50,398 --> 00:14:51,357
In that case…

244
00:14:51,983 --> 00:14:54,110
I rarely share this secret with others.

245
00:14:55,778 --> 00:14:57,071
The time is now.

246
00:14:58,614 --> 00:14:59,824
One dumpling.

247
00:15:08,249 --> 00:15:09,709
- On top.
- Yes.

248
00:15:18,593 --> 00:15:19,594
Isn't it good?

249
00:15:20,428 --> 00:15:21,929
This place makes great dumplings.

250
00:15:23,514 --> 00:15:26,934
I never got to enjoy such treats in life.

251
00:15:27,518 --> 00:15:28,936
I lived in vain.

252
00:15:30,021 --> 00:15:31,022
Anyway.

253
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:33,649
Is there a good timing for beer too?

254
00:15:34,692 --> 00:15:36,652
- Of course there is.
- When is it?

255
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:51,083
- Now!
- Now?

256
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:53,169
- Now?
- Now! Hurry.

257
00:16:02,887 --> 00:16:04,430
- Now.
- I was right, wasn't I?

258
00:16:05,515 --> 00:16:06,682
Nice timing.

259
00:16:10,645 --> 00:16:12,063
- You're home.
- Dad!

260
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:14,649
What's going on?

261
00:16:14,732 --> 00:16:17,276
- Did you come early to play with me?
- I'm…

262
00:16:18,653 --> 00:16:19,904
too tired to play.

263
00:16:19,987 --> 00:16:22,073
- Go play with Mom.
- I knew it.

264
00:16:22,156 --> 00:16:23,783
You would never play with me.

265
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:26,869
Cho-rong, why don't you show him
the new dance you learned today?

266
00:16:27,828 --> 00:16:29,413
I'm the best dancer in my class.

267
00:16:29,497 --> 00:16:31,249
Later. I'm tired.

268
00:16:34,377 --> 00:16:35,628
Where's dinner? I'm hungry.

269
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,006
Should the three of us eat out?

270
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,883
Or should we order something?

271
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:42,635
I want short ribs or fried chicken.

272
00:16:42,718 --> 00:16:45,346
- Should we?
- I'm sick of eating out.

273
00:16:45,429 --> 00:16:46,931
Let's just eat whatever we have.

274
00:16:58,693 --> 00:17:00,903
Honey, can you take out the trash?

275
00:17:01,696 --> 00:17:02,863
Honey?

276
00:17:33,394 --> 00:17:34,687
- Dad.
- Yes?

277
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,314
Where's your shame?

278
00:17:36,397 --> 00:17:38,608
If Mom cooked for you,

279
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:41,402
shouldn't you at least take the trash out?

280
00:17:41,485 --> 00:17:42,862
But I ate her food enthusiastically.

281
00:17:42,945 --> 00:17:44,322
Do you know how hard that is?

282
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:46,866
It must be one tough job.

283
00:17:47,825 --> 00:17:48,868
When I grow up,

284
00:17:48,951 --> 00:17:51,037
I'll never marry a lazy bum like you.

285
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:51,954
What?

286
00:17:52,496 --> 00:17:54,040
You used to say I was the coolest.

287
00:17:54,123 --> 00:17:57,543
I didn't know any better
because I was too young.

288
00:17:57,627 --> 00:17:58,628
What?

289
00:18:00,296 --> 00:18:02,298
That was ages ago.

290
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,219
You're all grown up. All grown.

291
00:18:42,713 --> 00:18:44,548
<i>First floor. Going down.</i>

292
00:18:46,217 --> 00:18:47,259
<i>Doors closing.</i>

293
00:19:24,046 --> 00:19:24,922
Did you sleep well?

294
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:26,882
Yes, thanks to you.

295
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:29,051
How do you want your breakfast?

296
00:19:29,677 --> 00:19:30,970
What time is it?

297
00:19:32,513 --> 00:19:33,347
Eight o'clock.

298
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:38,102
My shift begins at 3:00 p.m. today,
so may I sleep a little more?

299
00:19:38,185 --> 00:19:39,103
I'm sorry.

300
00:19:39,729 --> 00:19:41,605
I thought your shift began earlier.

301
00:19:41,689 --> 00:19:42,732
All right. Go to sleep.

302
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:46,068
Okay. Thank you.

303
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:14,096
Yes?

304
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,806
I pushed your checkout time to 3 p.m.

305
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:19,101
- Thank you.
- Okay. See you later.

306
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:20,853
- Sleep tight.
- Okay.

307
00:20:25,941 --> 00:20:27,109
What are you doing?

308
00:20:27,818 --> 00:20:28,944
What are you doing?

309
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:43,667
Oh no.

310
00:20:43,751 --> 00:20:44,668
What do we do?

311
00:20:46,921 --> 00:20:48,339
- Hide.
- What?

312
00:20:48,422 --> 00:20:49,507
Hide.

313
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:00,017
What do you want?

314
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,727
I heard you checked in yesterday,

315
00:21:01,811 --> 00:21:04,897
so I came by to see
if you found anything uncomfortable.

316
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,024
This unannounced visit is uncomfortable.

317
00:21:07,107 --> 00:21:07,983
I'm sorry.

318
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:10,528
I wanted to take extra good care of you.

319
00:21:10,611 --> 00:21:12,238
My checkout's at 3 p.m.

320
00:21:12,321 --> 00:21:15,783
I asked to make sure I'm undisturbed
because I wanted to get a good rest.

321
00:21:15,866 --> 00:21:17,117
Did you miss the memo?

322
00:21:18,536 --> 00:21:19,620
I'm sorry.

323
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:23,624
But if you need anything
or find anything uncomfortable--

324
00:21:23,707 --> 00:21:25,292
I don't need anything. Goodbye.

325
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:31,966
He's so cool.

326
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:34,635
That curt manner is his charm.

327
00:21:37,972 --> 00:21:40,015
Hello, you've reached Manager Kim Su-mi.

328
00:21:42,685 --> 00:21:44,645
His Highness is looking for me?

329
00:21:45,396 --> 00:21:46,772
Yes, okay.

330
00:21:46,856 --> 00:21:48,566
Oh my! What's happening?

331
00:21:54,697 --> 00:21:55,656
Where are you?

332
00:21:56,699 --> 00:21:58,075
You can come out now.

333
00:22:01,245 --> 00:22:02,288
Is she gone?

334
00:22:03,747 --> 00:22:05,583
It's not like you did anything wrong.

335
00:22:06,667 --> 00:22:08,460
I didn't want to give the wrong idea.

336
00:22:08,544 --> 00:22:11,338
Your behavior right now
will give people the wrong idea.

337
00:22:11,422 --> 00:22:13,215
I said this was your employee benefit.

338
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:14,675
You just made me look odd too.

339
00:22:14,758 --> 00:22:16,218
I'm completely awake now.

340
00:22:16,844 --> 00:22:18,554
- I must go.
- You don't have to.

341
00:22:19,096 --> 00:22:21,140
I told them not to disturb me.

342
00:22:21,724 --> 00:22:23,267
No, I'm fine, really.

343
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,477
I had a good rest thanks to your kindness.

344
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:27,479
- Thank you.
- Sure.

345
00:22:27,563 --> 00:22:28,939
I forgot.

346
00:22:29,023 --> 00:22:30,899
You're not the type that just listens.

347
00:23:01,764 --> 00:23:04,350
Nobody will come,
so don't mind them and sleep some more.

348
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,185
Okay?

349
00:23:50,437 --> 00:23:52,648
- Good afternoon.
- Not for me.

350
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:55,109
This isn't even the first time.
Are you teasing me?

351
00:23:55,984 --> 00:23:58,904
Were you my mortal enemy
in a previous life?

352
00:24:00,614 --> 00:24:03,158
Why do I have to run such petty errands?

353
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:04,493
Why?

354
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:06,870
What's this?

355
00:24:06,954 --> 00:24:11,750
Your Highness, this is a dress that meets
the dress code for tonight's party.

356
00:24:12,376 --> 00:24:15,087
Make sure you attend the party in this.

357
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:16,171
Says who?

358
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:17,881
The prince!

359
00:24:17,965 --> 00:24:19,258
Your prince!

360
00:24:31,854 --> 00:24:33,439
This is from His Highness.

361
00:24:33,522 --> 00:24:35,858
It's the outfit for tonight's party.
You must wear it.

362
00:24:37,443 --> 00:24:39,194
He can be annoying in so many ways.

363
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:41,488
But he sent you a present as a friend.

364
00:24:41,572 --> 00:24:42,614
You must be happy.

365
00:24:43,198 --> 00:24:44,575
He's not a friend.

366
00:24:44,658 --> 00:24:46,034
Stop it. I know you're glad.

367
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:48,537
Then allow me to open it.

368
00:24:49,246 --> 00:24:50,456
See that?

369
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:55,878
Good grief.

370
00:24:56,837 --> 00:24:57,963
He didn't have to…

371
00:25:03,051 --> 00:25:04,011
That little…

372
00:25:04,094 --> 00:25:06,346
What the fuck!

373
00:25:45,636 --> 00:25:46,678
Sa-rang.

374
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:52,643
I knew I had a good eye.

375
00:25:52,726 --> 00:25:54,186
I knew it'd look good on you.

376
00:25:55,646 --> 00:25:57,689
It's awkward to be in something like this.

377
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,900
I wanted you to see

378
00:25:59,983 --> 00:26:02,486
the kind of outfit that suits you best.

379
00:26:02,569 --> 00:26:05,781
I knew you'd look great
in an elegant garment like this.

380
00:26:06,532 --> 00:26:07,699
I see.

381
00:26:18,418 --> 00:26:19,461
Thank you.

382
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:25,467
Let us begin the party.

383
00:26:51,326 --> 00:26:52,995
What are you doing?

384
00:26:54,454 --> 00:26:55,497
And your outfit?

385
00:26:56,456 --> 00:26:57,457
I'm volunteering.

386
00:26:57,541 --> 00:26:59,793
All my butlers are dressed like that.

387
00:26:59,877 --> 00:27:01,128
Relax and sit, Sa-rang.

388
00:27:02,713 --> 00:27:03,755
Well,

389
00:27:04,298 --> 00:27:07,217
how can I relax and sit
when I feel uncomfortable?

390
00:27:07,301 --> 00:27:08,468
It's all right, ma'am.

391
00:27:08,552 --> 00:27:10,095
Please relax and take a seat.

392
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:18,103
Allow me to serve the wine.

393
00:27:26,194 --> 00:27:27,279
Shouldn't you tell us about it?

394
00:27:30,365 --> 00:27:32,868
I prepared this extremely overpriced wine

395
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:35,996
befitting of your position, Your Highness.

396
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:37,205
Drink up

397
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:40,125
and help boost our sales numbers.

398
00:27:41,168 --> 00:27:43,128
Does this hotel serve wine with that face?

399
00:27:54,348 --> 00:27:56,058
What? Are you telling me
to drink this and die?

400
00:27:56,642 --> 00:27:58,393
Take it however you like.

401
00:27:58,477 --> 00:28:01,521
You can either drink it and die,
or die and drink it.

402
00:28:01,605 --> 00:28:03,315
Let me prepare your food.

403
00:28:08,028 --> 00:28:10,113
What's going on? Why is he serving us?

404
00:28:10,197 --> 00:28:12,157
I put him up to it. For us.

405
00:28:13,408 --> 00:28:14,451
But why?

406
00:28:14,534 --> 00:28:16,954
You deserve only the best service.

407
00:28:17,037 --> 00:28:20,040
Someone like the hotel's head manager
seemed to qualify,

408
00:28:20,123 --> 00:28:21,124
so I got him.

409
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,628
Thank you very much,

410
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,422
but I'm still a staff member
of this hotel.

411
00:28:27,506 --> 00:28:28,966
Look at yourself right now.

412
00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:29,883
What suits you

413
00:28:30,634 --> 00:28:32,552
isn't a uniform, but a dress.

414
00:28:32,636 --> 00:28:34,263
Not a hotel, but my royal family.

415
00:28:34,346 --> 00:28:35,514
Marry me.

416
00:28:37,057 --> 00:28:37,891
Sorry?

417
00:28:37,975 --> 00:28:40,185
This is an official proposal.

418
00:28:40,269 --> 00:28:41,770
Will you marry me?

419
00:28:42,646 --> 00:28:44,481
Wait, what are you…

420
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:48,110
Sa-rang,

421
00:28:49,069 --> 00:28:50,404
my love.

422
00:29:12,259 --> 00:29:13,427
No!

423
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:14,928
- Never.
- What are you doing?

424
00:29:15,012 --> 00:29:15,887
Flat out no.

425
00:29:15,971 --> 00:29:18,098
I object to this proposal.

426
00:29:18,181 --> 00:29:19,599
Who do you think you are?

427
00:29:19,683 --> 00:29:21,685
Me? I have the right to say this.

428
00:29:21,768 --> 00:29:24,146
Because I'm…

429
00:29:24,646 --> 00:29:26,606
Ms. Cheon is one of my employees,

430
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:29,568
and I'm her employer
who has a responsibility to protect her.

431
00:29:29,651 --> 00:29:31,153
Not only that, you're a player,

432
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:32,821
and I can buy this too!

433
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:33,905
Anyway, no.

434
00:29:33,989 --> 00:29:36,450
I won't play along with this joke anymore.
I'm off.

435
00:29:36,533 --> 00:29:37,367
Let's go.

436
00:29:37,993 --> 00:29:38,994
Give me the ring.

437
00:29:44,374 --> 00:29:45,459
What?

438
00:29:46,168 --> 00:29:47,419
You're accepting this?

439
00:29:48,003 --> 00:29:49,546
It's a present for me.

440
00:29:49,629 --> 00:29:50,505
Give it to me.

441
00:30:19,201 --> 00:30:21,161
I've never seen such a pretty ring before.

442
00:30:24,873 --> 00:30:27,334
Thank you for regarding me favorably.

443
00:30:28,001 --> 00:30:31,004
I'll keep your kindness in my heart
and cherish it for a long time.

444
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:35,675
Wait, are you turning me down?

445
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:37,636
I'll just accept the thought.

446
00:30:38,595 --> 00:30:42,849
It was a huge honor to serve
a gentleman like you, Your Highness.

447
00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:47,729
I'll remember you for a very long time
as the most fabulous guest I've ever met.

448
00:30:47,813 --> 00:30:50,148
Please visit us again
as our best guest in history.

449
00:30:50,232 --> 00:30:53,151
We'll always serve you
joyfully and wholeheartedly.

450
00:30:56,613 --> 00:30:59,324
This was the first time
I wasn't hurt after a rejection.

451
00:31:00,033 --> 00:31:01,743
I was wrong.

452
00:31:01,827 --> 00:31:03,245
You're unlike what I thought.

453
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:06,289
You're much more special and fabulous.

454
00:31:06,873 --> 00:31:09,835
Your Highness, you're the one
who's special and fabulous.

455
00:31:09,918 --> 00:31:10,752
Okay.

456
00:31:10,836 --> 00:31:12,671
I'll back off this time.

457
00:31:13,463 --> 00:31:17,050
Next time, I'll come back with a ring
that's much prettier and more expensive.

458
00:31:17,968 --> 00:31:19,261
Don't turn me down then.

459
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:27,686
May we eat? I'm hungry.

460
00:31:27,769 --> 00:31:28,895
With Mr. Gu, of course.

461
00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:31,273
No, he's here as a server.

462
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:32,774
I don't want to dine with him.

463
00:31:33,984 --> 00:31:35,652
But it's your last day.

464
00:31:35,735 --> 00:31:37,279
Let's all enjoy supper.

465
00:31:39,406 --> 00:31:41,908
Well, if that's what you want.

466
00:31:43,076 --> 00:31:45,620
- Take a seat.
- Forget it. I don't want to eat.

467
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:52,419
Mr. Gu.

468
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:57,299
Mr. Gu.

469
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:02,012
Hermès.

470
00:32:08,602 --> 00:32:09,853
If you want it that badly,

471
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:12,522
then I'll join.

472
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,031
Sit down.

473
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:26,161
Serve before you sit.

474
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,209
Thank you.

475
00:32:32,792 --> 00:32:34,503
- Do it for me too.
- You've got hands.

476
00:32:39,508 --> 00:32:41,176
You're really annoying.

477
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:42,469
He has many girlfriends.

478
00:32:47,516 --> 00:32:48,350
Cheers.

479
00:32:52,145 --> 00:32:54,147
This is a present from me.

480
00:32:54,231 --> 00:32:56,024
Why isn't it just us two?

481
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:57,817
I'll be back soon.

482
00:32:57,901 --> 00:33:00,320
Don't start dating someone else
before I return,

483
00:33:00,403 --> 00:33:01,655
Sa-rang.

484
00:33:01,738 --> 00:33:03,114
You're always welcome here.

485
00:33:03,198 --> 00:33:04,407
Sa-rang.

486
00:33:05,951 --> 00:33:07,994
Hey, you should go. You're running late.

487
00:33:08,703 --> 00:33:10,247
I had fun thanks to you.

488
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:12,082
This is your tip.

489
00:33:12,999 --> 00:33:14,543
You're pretty stingy for a prince.

490
00:33:15,043 --> 00:33:16,127
What is this?

491
00:33:16,211 --> 00:33:17,712
Give me a blank check.

492
00:33:18,421 --> 00:33:20,173
This is generous
considering your performance.

493
00:33:20,924 --> 00:33:22,801
Be prepared as a guide next time.

494
00:33:24,219 --> 00:33:25,720
Good grief.

495
00:33:25,804 --> 00:33:28,265
Don't ever return.
I'm shutting the hotel down.

496
00:33:28,348 --> 00:33:30,684
I'll return before then.
Don't miss me too much.

497
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:36,690
See you again, my friend.

498
00:33:38,191 --> 00:33:39,276
What are you doing?

499
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:42,279
Come on. I don't need friends.

500
00:33:42,362 --> 00:33:43,863
Me neither.

501
00:33:43,947 --> 00:33:46,116
That makes you and I the same.

502
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,576
I'll be back.

503
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:48,994
My brother, Won.

504
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:54,541
Don't come back.

505
00:34:21,443 --> 00:34:22,819
You two really are friends,

506
00:34:22,902 --> 00:34:24,404
having fun until the last moment.

507
00:34:24,487 --> 00:34:25,864
Friends? Hardly.

508
00:34:25,947 --> 00:34:27,574
I hate guys like him.

509
00:34:30,577 --> 00:34:32,037
May I ask you something?

510
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:35,457
Why did you do that?

511
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:39,544
You would never accept
an order to serve food.

512
00:34:40,128 --> 00:34:41,796
And you dressed like a butler too.

513
00:34:43,465 --> 00:34:44,758
Because I promised to show

514
00:34:45,467 --> 00:34:46,509
a great performance

515
00:34:46,593 --> 00:34:49,763
as a representative of this hotel
until the very last moment.

516
00:34:53,892 --> 00:34:55,226
So? Did I do okay?

517
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:59,189
I hope I was worth training.

518
00:34:59,272 --> 00:35:00,106
Yes.

519
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:03,318
You did a splendid job.

520
00:35:06,363 --> 00:35:07,364
Anyway.

521
00:35:09,699 --> 00:35:11,117
Why did you take a while

522
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:13,620
to answer him yesterday?

523
00:35:15,455 --> 00:35:17,248
He proposed with sincerity,

524
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:20,335
so it wasn't good manners
to turn him down easily.

525
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:23,588
You shouldn't allow such punks leeway.

526
00:35:23,672 --> 00:35:25,590
There's no need
to show him manners either.

527
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,677
Wait.

528
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:31,096
Did you consider

529
00:35:32,013 --> 00:35:35,266
accepting his proposal even for a moment?

530
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:45,402
It's a secret.

531
00:35:46,695 --> 00:35:48,363
There are no secrets between us.

532
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:50,240
Of course there are secrets between us.

533
00:35:50,323 --> 00:35:52,200
You're about to make me really sad.

534
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:53,326
Will you be like this?

535
00:35:54,077 --> 00:35:55,328
You really won't tell me?

536
00:35:55,412 --> 00:35:56,663
It's a secret.

537
00:35:57,747 --> 00:35:58,748
I mean…

538
00:35:58,832 --> 00:36:00,041
It's a secret.

539
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:01,126
Please excuse me.

540
00:36:01,209 --> 00:36:02,794
Where are you going? I'm not done.

541
00:36:02,877 --> 00:36:05,338
It's the busiest time of the day,
so I should go.

542
00:36:05,422 --> 00:36:06,673
Please excuse me.

543
00:36:07,382 --> 00:36:09,008
- It's a secret.
- What?

544
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,555
Where's the Grand Ballroom?

545
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:15,265
Please come this way.

546
00:36:26,568 --> 00:36:27,652
A secret?

547
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,536
We're landing soon.
It's dangerous, so I'll wrap up.

548
00:36:36,619 --> 00:36:39,080
No, I got it.
You can get ready for landing.

549
00:36:48,006 --> 00:36:49,048
Here you go.

550
00:36:49,132 --> 00:36:50,175
Thank you.

551
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:56,806
<i>Dear passengers,</i>

552
00:36:56,890 --> 00:37:00,810
<i>we are now arriving
at Incheon International Airport.</i>

553
00:37:01,436 --> 00:37:02,937
<i>Please remain seated</i>

554
00:37:03,021 --> 00:37:05,482
<i>until the aircraft makes a full stop</i>

555
00:37:05,565 --> 00:37:07,317
<i>and the seatbelt sign turns off.</i>

556
00:37:08,193 --> 00:37:11,321
<i>Thank you for flying with King Air.</i>

557
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,615
<i>Our flight crew</i>

558
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:17,494
<i>will always serve you
in safety and comfort.</i>

559
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:26,586
My gosh!

560
00:37:27,837 --> 00:37:29,631
Pyeong-hwa, what's going on?

561
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:31,800
I know we've never met, but may I come in?

562
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:34,177
Sure, come on in.

563
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:40,642
One second.

564
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:46,940
What happened?

565
00:37:47,023 --> 00:37:49,484
I think she sprained her back.

566
00:37:50,068 --> 00:37:51,694
Could you put ice on her?

567
00:37:52,487 --> 00:37:54,531
After about 15 minutes,

568
00:37:54,614 --> 00:37:56,407
you can put a pain relief patch on her.

569
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:58,284
Okay.

570
00:37:58,868 --> 00:38:00,870
Don't worry. I'll take care of her.

571
00:38:01,496 --> 00:38:02,747
Yes, thank you.

572
00:38:03,331 --> 00:38:05,542
I'll introduce myself properly next time.

573
00:38:06,209 --> 00:38:07,168
Okay.

574
00:38:07,794 --> 00:38:09,003
I'll come by tomorrow.

575
00:38:09,712 --> 00:38:11,089
Don't do anything today

576
00:38:11,172 --> 00:38:13,424
and go right to bed, okay?

577
00:38:13,508 --> 00:38:15,093
Okay. Thank you.

578
00:38:16,511 --> 00:38:17,554
Good night.

579
00:38:18,847 --> 00:38:19,931
Goodbye.

580
00:38:22,392 --> 00:38:23,434
Bye.

581
00:38:25,311 --> 00:38:26,771
Take care.

582
00:38:33,278 --> 00:38:34,779
He's so attractive!

583
00:38:34,863 --> 00:38:37,615
- Who's that? The guy from that time?
- My back!

584
00:38:37,699 --> 00:38:39,826
My back.

585
00:38:42,412 --> 00:38:44,080
I'll put a pain relief patch on you.

586
00:38:50,378 --> 00:38:52,297
Goodness, you're such a fool.

587
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,382
It could've been much worse.

588
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:56,384
A promotion isn't worth getting hurt over.

589
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:58,595
It's not that I'm dying to get promoted.

590
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:01,139
It's my desperate struggle to survive.

591
00:39:01,222 --> 00:39:04,726
If you struggle a few more times,
you'll go broke buying these patches.

592
00:39:06,311 --> 00:39:08,062
Do you want to be a purser that badly?

593
00:39:09,022 --> 00:39:10,732
It's not that I want to.

594
00:39:11,316 --> 00:39:12,775
I really have to be one now.

595
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:16,863
But I don't think
it'll happen in this life.

596
00:39:18,323 --> 00:39:20,909
What if this is your last life?
Don't just give up.

597
00:39:20,992 --> 00:39:23,995
You even hurt your back working hard,
so keep it up until the end.

598
00:39:24,078 --> 00:39:26,080
No matter how hard I try,

599
00:39:27,415 --> 00:39:29,709
I can't even do half as much as others.

600
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:31,419
What do the others do?

601
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,796
Nobody works as hard as you.

602
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:42,513
A FEW HOURS AGO

603
00:39:45,892 --> 00:39:47,769
I thought you wanted to become L1.

604
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:49,228
I guess you aren't desperate.

605
00:39:50,647 --> 00:39:52,273
I'll work harder.

606
00:39:52,357 --> 00:39:54,192
That's your problem.

607
00:39:54,776 --> 00:39:56,194
Everyone works hard.

608
00:39:56,986 --> 00:39:59,155
It's because you only take
standard procedures.

609
00:40:00,365 --> 00:40:01,950
Other teams

610
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:04,077
carry the duty-free books around,

611
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,746
selling and even delivering
the items themselves.

612
00:40:08,456 --> 00:40:10,583
They'll get in trouble if they're caught.

613
00:40:10,667 --> 00:40:12,293
The company will go berserk.

614
00:40:12,377 --> 00:40:14,087
Do you really think they don't know?

615
00:40:15,129 --> 00:40:16,089
Pyeong-hwa.

616
00:40:16,172 --> 00:40:18,257
There's no free lunch in this world.

617
00:40:18,341 --> 00:40:22,095
Only those who are passionate enough
to put up with such danger

618
00:40:22,178 --> 00:40:23,346
get promoted.

619
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:26,140
Don't be scared.

620
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:28,184
I'm just sharing an example.

621
00:40:29,227 --> 00:40:31,562
To triumph in this fierce competition,

622
00:40:31,646 --> 00:40:36,025
you need to show enough passion
to match what the others are doing.

623
00:40:40,279 --> 00:40:41,280
Sa-rang.

624
00:40:42,281 --> 00:40:43,199
Yes?

625
00:40:43,825 --> 00:40:46,953
Are you free tomorrow evening?

626
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:50,748
SAMSAM SPA, HOT KILN SAUNA

627
00:40:58,172 --> 00:41:01,801
Why do I get freckles only on my face,
not my feet?

628
00:41:03,803 --> 00:41:05,013
They're never in the sun.

629
00:41:05,096 --> 00:41:07,223
There's skin on the feet too.

630
00:41:07,306 --> 00:41:09,434
But why would your soles get freckles?

631
00:41:09,517 --> 00:41:11,144
They'd need to see the sun.

632
00:41:11,227 --> 00:41:13,104
It's a shame we get freckles on our face.

633
00:41:14,147 --> 00:41:15,064
Oh my.

634
00:41:15,148 --> 00:41:16,941
You can get duty-free items

635
00:41:17,025 --> 00:41:19,402
without going on a trip?

636
00:41:20,028 --> 00:41:23,781
Yes, I'll personally deliver
items of your choosing.

637
00:41:23,865 --> 00:41:25,408
Try a little harder.

638
00:41:28,536 --> 00:41:30,413
Oh my, a door-to-door service?

639
00:41:30,496 --> 00:41:32,206
That is quite amazing!

640
00:41:33,541 --> 00:41:34,375
Oh my.

641
00:41:34,459 --> 00:41:36,627
Is this that miraculous cream
that flattens out

642
00:41:36,711 --> 00:41:38,838
every single wrinkle on you?

643
00:41:38,921 --> 00:41:40,214
You're right.

644
00:41:40,298 --> 00:41:42,008
You can give it a try.

645
00:41:42,592 --> 00:41:43,801
Let's see.

646
00:41:46,888 --> 00:41:47,722
My gosh.

647
00:41:48,306 --> 00:41:50,266
My eye wrinkles are disappearing.

648
00:41:50,349 --> 00:41:53,144
I feel ten years younger already.

649
00:41:55,438 --> 00:42:00,401
Yes, your wrinkles
really disappeared in an instant.

650
00:42:00,485 --> 00:42:02,737
Is this really only 59,900 won?

651
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,197
Is this not too cheap?

652
00:42:04,906 --> 00:42:05,823
What's that?

653
00:42:06,407 --> 00:42:07,617
Let me test it too.

654
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,494
Me too. Let me give it a try.

655
00:42:09,577 --> 00:42:10,828
- Me first.
- Okay.

656
00:42:10,912 --> 00:42:12,789
One second. Let me put it on you.

657
00:42:12,872 --> 00:42:13,915
I was here first.

658
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:17,710
This is a limited edition
for in-flight duty-free services,

659
00:42:17,794 --> 00:42:21,422
and a special promotion began
just this month.

660
00:42:21,506 --> 00:42:23,633
I saw this a few times
at department stores,

661
00:42:23,716 --> 00:42:26,344
but it was too tiny and expensive
for me to buy it.

662
00:42:26,969 --> 00:42:27,970
This is my chance.

663
00:42:28,054 --> 00:42:29,847
How many can I get? I'll take them all.

664
00:42:29,931 --> 00:42:31,933
You can't take everything.

665
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:33,434
Don't be like that, young lady.

666
00:42:33,518 --> 00:42:35,812
I can buy two of them.

667
00:42:35,895 --> 00:42:36,938
No, I'll take them all.

668
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:38,815
How much can I get? Like 50?

669
00:42:38,898 --> 00:42:41,901
You have made a very wonderful decision.

670
00:42:41,984 --> 00:42:43,778
- You look so much younger.
- Really?

671
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:45,446
Yes, your wrinkles are gone.

672
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:46,989
- Already?
- Yes!

673
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:55,248
Mr. Gu, did you visit HR?

674
00:42:55,331 --> 00:42:56,165
Why?

675
00:42:56,249 --> 00:42:58,584
You couldn't find
an old personnel record, right?

676
00:42:58,668 --> 00:43:02,171
He matched up every single file
with the hard copies since your visit

677
00:43:02,255 --> 00:43:04,090
but found nothing and came to me crying.

678
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:06,175
He's begging you for the name.

679
00:43:06,259 --> 00:43:07,176
Never mind.

680
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,970
Who is it? Who are you looking for?

681
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:09,971
It's fine.

682
00:43:10,513 --> 00:43:12,014
Isn't it in our online database?

683
00:43:12,098 --> 00:43:13,307
It was all digitized.

684
00:43:13,391 --> 00:43:16,018
It wasn't on the server.
That's why I went for a hard copy.

685
00:43:16,102 --> 00:43:18,479
Then the person
probably wasn't important here.

686
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:21,649
What?

687
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:24,527
If an employee's records
weren't kept in the files or the server,

688
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:26,529
it means they weren't important.

689
00:43:26,612 --> 00:43:27,446
In a word,

690
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:29,031
a nobody.

691
00:43:32,368 --> 00:43:33,452
What do you mean?

692
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:35,413
Those who are powerful

693
00:43:35,496 --> 00:43:37,248
or important end up getting recorded.

694
00:43:37,331 --> 00:43:38,833
I mean, some go down in history.

695
00:43:39,458 --> 00:43:40,626
But for the rest of us,

696
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:43,629
it doesn't matter
if we disappear without a trace,

697
00:43:44,463 --> 00:43:45,798
so their records get deleted.

698
00:43:46,883 --> 00:43:48,259
<i>I'm telling you for your sake.</i>

699
00:43:48,342 --> 00:43:50,136
Don't end up like your mom.

700
00:43:50,845 --> 00:43:51,846
See?

701
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:53,139
Nobody remembers her.

702
00:43:54,015 --> 00:43:56,434
<i>Both you and me.</i>

703
00:43:57,226 --> 00:43:58,561
<i>That's life for a loser.</i>

704
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:05,067
No one in this world is a nobody.

705
00:44:15,661 --> 00:44:17,330
Come on in.

706
00:44:18,164 --> 00:44:20,374
I expected the prince to be fussy,

707
00:44:20,458 --> 00:44:22,627
but he was rather friendly and polite.

708
00:44:23,628 --> 00:44:27,632
He also promised me he'd have
all of his guests stay here from now on.

709
00:44:27,715 --> 00:44:29,842
I knew you'd make this happen.

710
00:44:30,551 --> 00:44:31,594
Thank you.

711
00:44:32,845 --> 00:44:36,766
Invite Prince Samir
to our 100th anniversary.

712
00:44:36,849 --> 00:44:37,683
Yes, Father.

713
00:44:39,393 --> 00:44:42,063
I'd like to take charge
of the 100th-anniversary event.

714
00:44:42,688 --> 00:44:43,522
What?

715
00:44:43,606 --> 00:44:45,524
Do you know how important this is?

716
00:44:46,192 --> 00:44:49,654
We only invite the very elite
among our VIP guests.

717
00:44:49,737 --> 00:44:51,197
You can't handle that yet.

718
00:44:52,198 --> 00:44:53,699
Know your stuff before you speak.

719
00:44:53,783 --> 00:44:55,618
It's King Hotel's biggest event,

720
00:44:55,701 --> 00:44:57,370
so it must be held at King the Land.

721
00:44:58,746 --> 00:45:01,332
You must've had a tough time
managing everything alone.

722
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:03,501
You can leave it to me now.

723
00:45:07,546 --> 00:45:09,382
Yes, you finally came to your senses.

724
00:45:09,966 --> 00:45:11,509
Okay, you can take charge.

725
00:45:11,592 --> 00:45:12,510
Father.

726
00:45:13,135 --> 00:45:14,512
Won can't handle this yet.

727
00:45:14,595 --> 00:45:17,974
Seeing how well he handled Prince Samir,
I think we can rely on him.

728
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:22,269
Hwa-ran, have faith in him
and let him try this.

729
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:24,021
You can do it, right?

730
00:45:24,605 --> 00:45:25,856
- Yes.
- Great.

731
00:45:27,566 --> 00:45:28,901
- Let's eat.
- Okay.

732
00:45:30,569 --> 00:45:31,946
Let's eat.

733
00:45:34,323 --> 00:45:37,827
Are you really starting something with me?

734
00:45:38,411 --> 00:45:40,413
You said I'd have to
fight you for life here.

735
00:45:41,706 --> 00:45:43,457
It's inevitable, so I'll try my best.

736
00:45:45,626 --> 00:45:48,421
Do you think someone like you
has a chance against me?

737
00:45:48,504 --> 00:45:49,839
I told you before

738
00:45:49,922 --> 00:45:53,676
that someone like you
shouldn't own the company.

739
00:45:53,759 --> 00:45:56,303
Since when did you care so much
about the company?

740
00:45:56,387 --> 00:45:57,847
It's because you went too far.

741
00:45:57,930 --> 00:46:00,766
If you placed an employee in danger
over some ginseng,

742
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:02,309
you should've at least sent help.

743
00:46:02,393 --> 00:46:04,895
Or you could give the staff
the incentives they deserve

744
00:46:04,979 --> 00:46:06,522
for bringing up sales.

745
00:46:06,605 --> 00:46:07,982
What are you trying to do?

746
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:12,361
The employees are supposed to
earn their paychecks.

747
00:46:13,612 --> 00:46:15,573
Why should we give them incentives

748
00:46:15,656 --> 00:46:16,907
simply for doing their job?

749
00:46:19,493 --> 00:46:21,412
- That sounds like you.
- Don't be snarky.

750
00:46:24,498 --> 00:46:26,167
What are you betting in this fight?

751
00:46:28,169 --> 00:46:29,253
I've put in everything.

752
00:46:30,004 --> 00:46:31,589
I'm putting up my fight

753
00:46:32,715 --> 00:46:34,008
with everything on the line.

754
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:44,018
I didn't want to fight.

755
00:46:45,394 --> 00:46:46,979
But you keep getting me involved.

756
00:46:48,272 --> 00:46:51,859
I keep seeing employees suffering
from unfair treatment.

757
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:53,360
I'm complicit if I stay put.

758
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:56,697
I'm going to try and protect the people

759
00:46:57,573 --> 00:46:58,574
that you deem

760
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:00,951
as nobodies.

761
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:09,418
Who do you even think you are?

762
00:47:09,502 --> 00:47:11,545
At the very least, I have a conscience.

763
00:47:12,338 --> 00:47:13,756
So I'm better than you.

764
00:47:14,465 --> 00:47:15,925
Let's have a good fight.

765
00:47:20,721 --> 00:47:21,972
You know what?

766
00:47:23,349 --> 00:47:25,309
Those who fight for others…

767
00:47:27,561 --> 00:47:29,188
stand no chance against someone

768
00:47:30,189 --> 00:47:31,440
who fights for themselves.

769
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:36,112
Good luck.

770
00:49:17,922 --> 00:49:18,964
What's this?

771
00:49:23,552 --> 00:49:25,054
Why are you there?

772
00:49:26,805 --> 00:49:28,432
Let go of me. Let go.

773
00:49:29,058 --> 00:49:31,101
Cheon Sa-rang.

774
00:49:31,185 --> 00:49:32,144
No.

775
00:49:32,228 --> 00:49:33,354
Let go of him.

776
00:49:33,437 --> 00:49:34,271
Let me go!

777
00:49:37,191 --> 00:49:38,192
No!

778
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:10,432
Hello, sir.

779
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:12,893
<i>That's what you call being a nuisance.</i>

780
00:50:12,977 --> 00:50:15,771
It was a special request
from the head manager.

781
00:50:15,854 --> 00:50:17,731
It may seem like a simple favor to you,

782
00:50:17,815 --> 00:50:20,651
but for us,
it's an order that must be obeyed.

783
00:50:25,447 --> 00:50:26,490
I'm sorry.

784
00:50:26,573 --> 00:50:28,242
Did I keep you here late?

785
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:29,201
No, sir.

786
00:50:29,285 --> 00:50:30,953
Even if it hadn't been you,

787
00:50:31,036 --> 00:50:34,373
it's only natural for us to serve
every single guest with utmost care.

788
00:50:34,456 --> 00:50:36,000
Please come by whenever you like.

789
00:50:36,792 --> 00:50:38,544
I'll leave on time in the future.

790
00:50:39,086 --> 00:50:40,087
Goodbye.

791
00:50:54,727 --> 00:50:57,354
Tap on it and let it seep in.

792
00:50:58,147 --> 00:50:59,440
That's nice.

793
00:51:00,441 --> 00:51:01,567
Try it.

794
00:51:05,988 --> 00:51:06,822
Hello?

795
00:51:07,531 --> 00:51:08,824
May I see you?

796
00:51:09,575 --> 00:51:10,576
Right now?

797
00:51:11,994 --> 00:51:13,370
I'm busy right now.

798
00:51:13,454 --> 00:51:15,456
- <i>I'll see you next time.</i>
- I'll go to you.

799
00:51:16,457 --> 00:51:18,208
- You're going to come here?
- <i>Yes.</i>

800
00:51:18,292 --> 00:51:20,044
I have something to say too.

801
00:51:22,296 --> 00:51:24,340
- Is this important?
- <i>Yes.</i>

802
00:51:26,508 --> 00:51:29,345
This isn't a place
to say something important.

803
00:51:29,428 --> 00:51:30,346
I'll see you next time.

804
00:51:30,429 --> 00:51:32,056
No, I have to see you now.

805
00:51:32,806 --> 00:51:33,766
Where are you?

806
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:50,115
SAMSAM SPA, HOT KILN SAUNA

807
00:52:19,937 --> 00:52:21,063
You found me all right.

808
00:52:21,146 --> 00:52:23,482
- Hey.
- And you're in sauna attire too.

809
00:52:24,441 --> 00:52:26,110
Why is everyone lounging around?

810
00:52:27,403 --> 00:52:28,320
It's a sauna.

811
00:52:30,322 --> 00:52:32,449
- Show me your arm.
- I know that.

812
00:52:33,033 --> 00:52:35,702
So why is everyone lying here
instead of at their homes?

813
00:52:36,537 --> 00:52:37,913
That's what people do here.

814
00:52:38,664 --> 00:52:40,999
You have to wear it like this
not to lose it.

815
00:52:42,835 --> 00:52:44,002
What did you have to say?

816
00:52:46,672 --> 00:52:47,881
Do I have to say it here?

817
00:52:47,965 --> 00:52:50,217
I told you.
That's why I wanted to see you later.

818
00:52:50,968 --> 00:52:52,594
- Let's go outside.
- No.

819
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:54,304
My friends are here.

820
00:52:54,972 --> 00:52:56,807
- Your friends?
- Oh my, Mr. No!

821
00:52:58,976 --> 00:53:00,602
- What brings you here?
- Hey.

822
00:53:01,895 --> 00:53:03,564
You should go.

823
00:53:03,647 --> 00:53:05,149
It'll be a pain if you stay.

824
00:53:05,232 --> 00:53:06,483
Hurry and go.

825
00:53:08,444 --> 00:53:10,028
I wanted you as my wingman,

826
00:53:10,112 --> 00:53:11,488
but you were an awful actor.

827
00:53:11,572 --> 00:53:14,116
I'm doing so well.
Everything is sold out thanks to me.

828
00:53:14,199 --> 00:53:16,452
Hey, I'm the one who did everything.

829
00:53:16,535 --> 00:53:18,495
You need to act naturally to draw a crowd.

830
00:53:19,538 --> 00:53:21,206
Mr. No, try one.

831
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:22,499
I'm fine.

832
00:53:28,213 --> 00:53:29,465
Thank you.

833
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:42,644
Anyway,

834
00:53:42,728 --> 00:53:44,104
wasn't I a good actor?

835
00:53:44,688 --> 00:53:47,232
You were totally awful. So rigid.

836
00:53:47,316 --> 00:53:49,526
You need to do better to draw people.

837
00:53:49,610 --> 00:53:51,028
Try to be more natural.

838
00:53:51,111 --> 00:53:53,822
Exactly. I said your role is important.

839
00:53:54,323 --> 00:53:55,866
I won't help if you give me a hard time.

840
00:53:56,450 --> 00:53:57,367
Let's go.

841
00:54:02,039 --> 00:54:04,249
Did you skip dinner?

842
00:54:05,209 --> 00:54:06,752
Is it your first time trying these?

843
00:54:08,837 --> 00:54:11,006
I can't believe
you've never had these before.

844
00:54:11,798 --> 00:54:13,175
Try this too. Here.

845
00:54:14,676 --> 00:54:15,802
Thank you.

846
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:22,392
By the way, what's with these?

847
00:54:22,476 --> 00:54:24,228
They don't seem like regular eggs.

848
00:54:24,311 --> 00:54:25,771
- Let's go.
- Aren't they good?

849
00:54:25,854 --> 00:54:27,564
They were roasted on a stone plate.

850
00:54:27,648 --> 00:54:28,690
Go on. You can have these.

851
00:54:28,774 --> 00:54:30,692
Goodness, thank you.

852
00:54:30,776 --> 00:54:32,110
Hey, wait.

853
00:54:33,278 --> 00:54:35,781
Are you here to eat eggs or to see me?

854
00:54:35,864 --> 00:54:39,159
How could I leave before finishing these
when she kindly gave them to me?

855
00:54:41,453 --> 00:54:43,455
This is quite delicious.

856
00:54:58,011 --> 00:54:58,929
Wait.

857
00:54:59,596 --> 00:55:01,765
How about Mr. No instead of Sa-rang?

858
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:03,600
Me?

859
00:55:03,684 --> 00:55:06,186
The more the merrier, right?

860
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:08,313
- I say yes.
- Why won't you ask me?

861
00:55:08,397 --> 00:55:10,732
Come on, we're all family.
Give her a hand.

862
00:55:10,816 --> 00:55:12,317
Just be a wingman.

863
00:55:12,401 --> 00:55:13,735
A wingman? For what?

864
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:15,946
He's not good at it.

865
00:55:16,029 --> 00:55:16,947
It's not a big deal.

866
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:18,949
All you have to do
is memorize a few lines.

867
00:55:40,178 --> 00:55:43,557
Wait, you can get duty-free items at home
without traveling abroad?

868
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:47,019
Yes, and you get an extra 10% off too.

869
00:55:47,102 --> 00:55:49,605
Wait, an extra 10% off
of the duty-free prices?

870
00:55:49,688 --> 00:55:50,772
Yes.

871
00:55:50,856 --> 00:55:53,275
On top of that, just for today,

872
00:55:53,358 --> 00:55:56,320
if you purchase red ginseng extract,
you get one for free.

873
00:55:56,903 --> 00:55:59,114
Then I'll take four ginseng extract sets

874
00:55:59,197 --> 00:56:00,574
and three multivitamins.

875
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:02,576
And one eye cream for you, babe.

876
00:56:03,368 --> 00:56:05,245
Get your stuff while they're on sale.

877
00:56:05,329 --> 00:56:07,372
You won't find another chance like this.

878
00:56:07,456 --> 00:56:10,250
Wait, red ginseng is half off?
Which brand?

879
00:56:10,334 --> 00:56:11,585
Let me see it too.

880
00:56:12,836 --> 00:56:14,338
It's this one.

881
00:56:14,421 --> 00:56:16,965
Right now, it's buy one, get one free.

882
00:56:17,049 --> 00:56:18,675
I see. Duty-free items.

883
00:56:18,759 --> 00:56:20,260
Is anything else on sale?

884
00:56:20,344 --> 00:56:21,511
Everything.

885
00:56:21,595 --> 00:56:24,222
Cosmetics, liquor, accessories,
health supplements, everything.

886
00:56:24,306 --> 00:56:26,642
Take your time
and let me know whatever you need.

887
00:56:26,725 --> 00:56:28,393
- This one's good.
- It's cheaper than duty-free?

888
00:56:29,019 --> 00:56:30,145
Of course.

889
00:56:30,228 --> 00:56:32,648
I bought this from her last time,

890
00:56:32,731 --> 00:56:35,901
and it was half the price
you see at department stores.

891
00:56:35,984 --> 00:56:38,028
You can't travel abroad every single day,

892
00:56:38,111 --> 00:56:39,696
so I think this is a great chance.

893
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:40,906
This is wonderful.

894
00:56:40,989 --> 00:56:43,408
- My gosh.
- You want three? You won't even finish it.

895
00:56:43,492 --> 00:56:45,327
- Just get two.
- These are half off.

896
00:56:45,410 --> 00:56:48,205
- Two, two, two, so six packs.
- So cheap.

897
00:56:48,288 --> 00:56:50,082
- Right?
- This is great!

898
00:56:50,666 --> 00:56:52,793
You should probably get one each.

899
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:54,169
This is the cheapest one.

900
00:56:54,252 --> 00:56:55,504
You wanted to get this.

901
00:56:55,587 --> 00:56:58,173
- Yes, this is it.
- Really?

902
00:56:58,256 --> 00:57:00,717
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

903
00:57:04,638 --> 00:57:07,766
You'll be able to reach the top
after a few more rounds.

904
00:57:07,849 --> 00:57:08,892
Thank you.

905
00:57:08,976 --> 00:57:11,186
I'll never forget your help.

906
00:57:11,728 --> 00:57:13,438
Thank you, Mr. No.

907
00:57:13,522 --> 00:57:15,607
Well, I'm good at everything.

908
00:57:15,691 --> 00:57:17,192
You were really good.

909
00:57:17,901 --> 00:57:19,945
You'll make a living
no matter where you go.

910
00:57:21,279 --> 00:57:23,782
Anyway, do you have to go this far?

911
00:57:23,865 --> 00:57:24,950
This is illegal.

912
00:57:25,951 --> 00:57:27,244
It's not illegal.

913
00:57:27,953 --> 00:57:28,787
It's not, right?

914
00:57:34,793 --> 00:57:36,461
It's not illegal, right?

915
00:57:38,755 --> 00:57:39,840
It is.

916
00:57:41,925 --> 00:57:43,176
It is?

917
00:57:45,012 --> 00:57:46,138
Only I didn't know?

918
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:48,515
I'm sorry.

919
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:50,017
I thought you knew.

920
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:51,393
This is really wrong.

921
00:57:51,476 --> 00:57:52,644
Why are you taking it so far?

922
00:57:52,728 --> 00:57:54,312
Don't be so harsh on her.

923
00:57:54,396 --> 00:57:56,440
She must've been pressured into doing it.

924
00:57:56,523 --> 00:57:58,984
And she's paying
for that extra discount too.

925
00:57:59,067 --> 00:58:00,694
Why would you even spend your own money?

926
00:58:00,777 --> 00:58:01,862
What if you get caught?

927
00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:03,530
Because I have to.

928
00:58:07,242 --> 00:58:08,452
Let's stop now.

929
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:10,620
Wrongdoing isn't for everyone.

930
00:58:10,704 --> 00:58:14,499
People like us can't sleep in peace
after we do something wrong.

931
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:17,377
This darned conscience.

932
00:58:17,461 --> 00:58:19,880
Why do we stay honest
when nobody gives us the credit?

933
00:58:19,963 --> 00:58:21,131
Who cares if no one does?

934
00:58:21,214 --> 00:58:22,299
We can give it to each other.

935
00:58:23,425 --> 00:58:26,678
We all know that
Pyeong-hwa is a great worker.

936
00:58:26,762 --> 00:58:28,972
Yes, our little bear is the best.

937
00:58:30,057 --> 00:58:31,099
Stop it.

938
00:58:32,017 --> 00:58:33,435
Who cares if it's just you two?

939
00:58:33,518 --> 00:58:35,062
I'll give you the credit too.

940
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:37,522
What good is that, Mr. No?

941
00:58:37,606 --> 00:58:39,274
But still, I'll give it to you.

942
00:58:39,357 --> 00:58:42,527
I'll remember that the company
made you take things this far.

943
00:58:43,445 --> 00:58:44,863
I won't forget it.

944
00:58:45,739 --> 00:58:47,074
Thank you for saying that.

945
00:58:47,824 --> 00:58:51,161
The ones who should know that
are those up high and not you, Mr. No.

946
00:58:58,668 --> 00:59:01,046
You'll see a better day. I know it.

947
00:59:01,922 --> 00:59:03,548
Let's make a toast for that day.

948
00:59:04,966 --> 00:59:06,718
Sounds great. Cheers!

949
00:59:06,802 --> 00:59:08,303
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

950
00:59:11,181 --> 00:59:13,683
It was wonderful to see you
try so hard today.

951
00:59:14,893 --> 00:59:16,561
You were the best one.

952
00:59:24,486 --> 00:59:25,570
Mr. No?

953
00:59:26,446 --> 00:59:27,572
Do you want to play?

954
00:59:37,292 --> 00:59:38,418
Mr. No.

955
00:59:39,002 --> 00:59:40,170
You like Sa-rang, right?

956
00:59:40,963 --> 00:59:42,714
Do you even need to ask?

957
00:59:42,798 --> 00:59:43,674
It's so obvious.

958
00:59:44,299 --> 00:59:45,133
No.

959
00:59:45,217 --> 00:59:46,468
What? Really?

960
00:59:47,094 --> 00:59:50,138
Then we'll lose you
and go with the Arab prince.

961
00:59:50,889 --> 00:59:52,724
Why are you bringing him up right now?

962
00:59:52,808 --> 00:59:55,978
He's a total player
with the worst personality.

963
00:59:56,061 --> 00:59:58,814
He called Sa-rang last night.

964
00:59:58,897 --> 01:00:02,526
He offered to fly us out to Dubai
on a private jet this summer.

965
01:00:02,609 --> 01:00:04,736
That prince's generosity
is out of this world.

966
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:07,030
We're in for a treat thanks to Sa-rang.

967
01:00:07,114 --> 01:00:08,407
He called?

968
01:00:09,032 --> 01:00:09,908
Wait.

969
01:00:10,492 --> 01:00:13,829
I clearly remember you two saying
I pass as Sa-rang's boyfriend.

970
01:00:13,912 --> 01:00:15,914
You both said you'd take my side.

971
01:00:15,998 --> 01:00:16,915
Me?

972
01:00:16,999 --> 01:00:17,833
Yes.

973
01:00:17,916 --> 01:00:20,794
To be exact, it was both of you,
including Pyeong-hwa.

974
01:00:20,877 --> 01:00:22,087
Me too?

975
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:24,923
Yes, I clearly remember your approval.

976
01:00:26,717 --> 01:00:29,303
My gosh. Is betrayal your specialty?

977
01:00:30,345 --> 01:00:31,430
This isn't betrayal.

978
01:00:31,513 --> 01:00:33,515
We're just being smart.

979
01:00:33,598 --> 01:00:35,309
Dubai is calling us!

980
01:00:41,315 --> 01:00:43,608
Hey, we're all one big family.

981
01:00:43,692 --> 01:00:44,943
Let's not do this.

982
01:00:45,027 --> 01:00:47,529
But you said you didn't like her.

983
01:00:47,612 --> 01:00:49,781
So I think we're done here.

984
01:00:49,865 --> 01:00:50,782
Wait.

985
01:00:51,992 --> 01:00:53,035
Let us

986
01:00:54,077 --> 01:00:55,245
chat some more

987
01:00:55,996 --> 01:00:57,956
until we use up all these coins.

988
01:01:01,418 --> 01:01:02,336
Please sit.

989
01:01:06,798 --> 01:01:07,966
<i>Round One.</i>

990
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,177
<i>Ready, go!</i>

991
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:11,219
Tell her.

992
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:13,138
Tell her what?

993
01:01:13,221 --> 01:01:14,639
How you feel.

994
01:01:14,723 --> 01:01:16,099
"I like you. Go out with me."

995
01:01:16,183 --> 01:01:17,893
How is that so difficult?

996
01:01:18,935 --> 01:01:21,396
Do I have to say it in words?

997
01:01:22,272 --> 01:01:23,565
It's the heart that counts.

998
01:01:23,648 --> 01:01:25,317
She won't know if you don't say it.

999
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:28,403
If you keep beating around the bush,
you'll end up losing her.

1000
01:01:29,404 --> 01:01:30,739
Just ask her out.

1001
01:01:59,559 --> 01:02:00,519
Nice!

1002
01:02:03,855 --> 01:02:05,148
<i>K.O. Nice!</i>

1003
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:13,657
Isn't a cold treat nice

1004
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:15,784
after sitting in the hot sauna?

1005
01:02:15,867 --> 01:02:16,785
Yes.

1006
01:02:16,868 --> 01:02:18,286
I get why people come here.

1007
01:02:22,165 --> 01:02:23,834
Thank you for today.

1008
01:02:24,584 --> 01:02:27,295
We're all one big family,
so we should help each other out.

1009
01:02:30,006 --> 01:02:31,258
You've changed a lot.

1010
01:02:32,217 --> 01:02:35,470
You used to be so scathing,
but you even make jokes now.

1011
01:02:49,109 --> 01:02:50,318
Are you free next weekend?

1012
01:02:52,404 --> 01:02:53,530
Why do you ask?

1013
01:02:55,198 --> 01:02:58,160
I want to talk about us.

1014
01:02:59,911 --> 01:03:01,329
About us?

1015
01:03:02,664 --> 01:03:04,541
Yes, about us.

1016
01:03:07,169 --> 01:03:08,420
Let's talk about us.

1017
01:03:16,011 --> 01:03:16,845
Okay.

1018
01:04:23,703 --> 01:04:26,331
WONSIKDANG

1019
01:04:43,431 --> 01:04:44,391
Welcome.

1020
01:04:44,474 --> 01:04:45,809
What's all this?

1021
01:04:45,892 --> 01:04:47,519
Are you Ms. Cheon Sa-rang?

1022
01:04:48,353 --> 01:04:50,480
- Yes.
- May I take your coat?

1023
01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:52,732
Thank you.

1024
01:05:02,617 --> 01:05:04,202
This way, please.

1025
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:08,331
Thank you.

1026
01:05:13,753 --> 01:05:17,173
Our restaurant only serves
the chef's special.

1027
01:05:17,257 --> 01:05:18,383
Is that all right?

1028
01:05:18,883 --> 01:05:21,595
Yes, please serve me your best.

1029
01:05:22,262 --> 01:05:24,681
So who's the chef?

1030
01:05:24,764 --> 01:05:25,849
I'm today's chef,

1031
01:05:25,932 --> 01:05:27,225
Gu Won.

1032
01:05:27,309 --> 01:05:28,768
I see. Do you also cook?

1033
01:05:29,352 --> 01:05:32,564
It'd be faster if you asked
for the things I couldn't do.

1034
01:05:34,107 --> 01:05:37,902
I remember that
you couldn't even peel an onion.

1035
01:05:37,986 --> 01:05:39,988
Please forget that ancient history.

1036
01:05:40,071 --> 01:05:43,408
I received special training
from the best chef,

1037
01:05:43,491 --> 01:05:45,285
so please be rest assured.

1038
01:05:45,368 --> 01:05:46,578
You're quite passionate.

1039
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:48,622
I will let go of my worries.

1040
01:05:48,705 --> 01:05:51,958
I'm solely in charge
of cooking and serving tonight.

1041
01:05:52,042 --> 01:05:53,168
So I ask

1042
01:05:53,251 --> 01:05:56,296
for your generous understanding
even if you face a bit of delay.

1043
01:05:56,379 --> 01:05:57,797
Sure, I'm okay with that.

1044
01:05:57,881 --> 01:06:00,258
Please take your time
and bring me delicious dishes.

1045
01:06:06,056 --> 01:06:08,350
We must have a drink on a night like this.

1046
01:06:10,143 --> 01:06:12,520
I made this sangria myself.

1047
01:06:14,064 --> 01:06:15,899
You made this yourself?

1048
01:06:15,982 --> 01:06:16,816
Yes.

1049
01:06:17,484 --> 01:06:18,777
Let me try it.

1050
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:27,952
This is really good.

1051
01:06:33,166 --> 01:06:34,751
The appetizer.

1052
01:06:38,505 --> 01:06:41,007
How could I eat something this cute?

1053
01:06:41,091 --> 01:06:42,300
Then you can just stare at it.

1054
01:06:42,384 --> 01:06:43,968
No, I must try it.

1055
01:06:44,052 --> 01:06:45,387
Thank you.

1056
01:06:51,101 --> 01:06:53,103
- This is so good.
- Of course.

1057
01:06:53,186 --> 01:06:55,230
So you really can cook.

1058
01:06:55,313 --> 01:06:57,315
The problem is that
I'm good at everything.

1059
01:06:57,399 --> 01:06:59,067
Look forward to the next dish.

1060
01:06:59,150 --> 01:07:00,193
Okay.

1061
01:07:52,203 --> 01:07:53,788
Pasta.

1062
01:07:54,539 --> 01:07:56,291
Let me try this.

1063
01:08:04,591 --> 01:08:06,176
This is really good.

1064
01:08:06,801 --> 01:08:07,844
You should try it too.

1065
01:08:09,053 --> 01:08:10,138
Here.

1066
01:08:15,351 --> 01:08:17,020
- Pretty good.
- It's not just good.

1067
01:08:17,103 --> 01:08:19,147
It's really delicious.

1068
01:08:19,939 --> 01:08:20,774
Chef Gu.

1069
01:08:22,108 --> 01:08:23,651
This is excellent.

1070
01:08:23,735 --> 01:08:25,904
Thank you for noticing.

1071
01:08:25,987 --> 01:08:27,572
You made it all worthwhile.

1072
01:08:28,531 --> 01:08:31,284
Anyway, what's the occasion?

1073
01:08:33,536 --> 01:08:36,289
It's a very important day.

1074
01:08:37,457 --> 01:08:38,666
What is it?

1075
01:08:39,918 --> 01:08:41,544
A day to treat my VIP, Ms. Cheon.

1076
01:08:43,046 --> 01:08:45,048
It finally hit me when Samir was here.

1077
01:08:45,673 --> 01:08:48,968
I found out what it felt like
to humor and serve all kinds of jerks.

1078
01:08:49,761 --> 01:08:53,723
Then I realized you must've made
a lot of effort to be the best talent,

1079
01:08:54,724 --> 01:08:56,476
so I wanted to treat you with my best.

1080
01:08:57,936 --> 01:08:59,020
I knew it.

1081
01:08:59,854 --> 01:09:03,483
I felt like I was warmly welcomed
as soon as I entered.

1082
01:09:03,566 --> 01:09:04,901
I'm glad you felt that way.

1083
01:09:05,485 --> 01:09:06,694
So sincerity always works.

1084
01:09:08,154 --> 01:09:09,447
Thank you.

1085
01:09:09,531 --> 01:09:12,867
It's an honor to enjoy
such wonderful dishes.

1086
01:09:15,912 --> 01:09:16,996
Also,

1087
01:09:18,373 --> 01:09:21,960
I'd like to have
a serious conversation with you.

1088
01:09:23,461 --> 01:09:24,879
What's it about?

1089
01:09:27,549 --> 01:09:29,342
That's to come after dinner.

1090
01:09:29,926 --> 01:09:31,219
I'll tell you then.

1091
01:09:31,302 --> 01:09:34,222
The best part is yet to come,
so give me a minute.

1092
01:09:34,305 --> 01:09:35,473
What is it?

1093
01:09:36,891 --> 01:09:37,934
Do you want to know?

1094
01:09:42,647 --> 01:09:44,774
- May I have another glass?
- One second.

1095
01:09:44,858 --> 01:09:47,193
- I'll bring it over after this.
- I can get it.

1096
01:09:59,831 --> 01:10:02,542
You're kind of cool today.

1097
01:10:02,625 --> 01:10:03,877
I'm always cool.

1098
01:10:07,505 --> 01:10:08,339
Now.

1099
01:10:09,215 --> 01:10:11,426
This is the highlight of the meal.

1100
01:10:42,498 --> 01:10:44,542
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

1101
01:10:45,585 --> 01:10:46,628
No.

1102
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:52,300
What will you do with all these?

1103
01:10:57,889 --> 01:10:59,265
As long as you aren't hurt,

1104
01:11:00,099 --> 01:11:01,184
it's all right.

1105
01:11:47,605 --> 01:11:49,065
Do I have…

1106
01:11:50,274 --> 01:11:51,401
permission?

1107
01:14:03,157 --> 01:14:06,160
KING THE LAND

1109
01:14:38,734 --> 01:14:40,736
<i>- Are you upset?
- As if.</i>

1110
01:14:40,820 --> 01:14:42,029
Don't be upset.

1111
01:14:43,531 --> 01:14:44,949
- That's not--
- Forget it.

1112
01:14:45,032 --> 01:14:47,118
<i>You have feelings for Sa-rang, don't you?</i>

1113
01:14:50,663 --> 01:14:53,166
You don't pass as Sa-rang's partner.

1114
01:14:53,249 --> 01:14:54,542
Be careful!

1115
01:14:56,335 --> 01:14:57,170
Sa-rang!

1116
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:00,089
<i>Mr. Gu!</i>

1117
01:15:00,173 --> 01:15:02,884
<i>I heard you finally declared war
against Ms. Gu.</i>

1118
01:15:02,967 --> 01:15:05,136
I will take charge of the hotel.

1119
01:15:05,928 --> 01:15:07,054
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1120
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:08,806
No.

1121
01:15:08,890 --> 01:15:11,434
<i>I'll leave in a bit.
It's because I want to see you.</i>

1122
01:15:11,517 --> 01:15:13,102
Mr. Gu!
