KING THE LAND

00:00:53,049 --> 00:00:57,055
KING THE LAND

3
00:00:57,469 --> 00:00:59,082
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

4
00:00:59,163 --> 00:01:00,902
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

5
00:01:08,403 --> 00:01:09,570
RESUME

6
00:01:09,654 --> 00:01:10,738
Is this you?

7
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:14,575
I put on a little weight.

8
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:16,744
I don't need a high salary.

9
00:01:16,828 --> 00:01:19,330
I hope I don't have to stand all day.
I have flat feet.

10
00:01:19,414 --> 00:01:20,748
- Excuse--
- Where do we eat?

11
00:01:20,832 --> 00:01:24,127
Communication is key
for a hotel concierge.

12
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,628
- Will you be able to communicate…
- Don't worry.

13
00:01:25,712 --> 00:01:27,213
I'm super fluent in Korean.

14
00:01:27,297 --> 00:01:30,049
I majored in political science
and international relations.

15
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:31,467
I will lead the conversations

16
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,678
from the guests' perspectives…

17
00:01:35,096 --> 00:01:36,639
I'm shy. Please don't look at me.

18
00:01:38,224 --> 00:01:39,600
Excuse me…

19
00:01:39,684 --> 00:01:40,852
2015 KING HOTEL TRAINEESHIP INTERVIEW

20
00:01:51,446 --> 00:01:53,740
Number 511, please come in.

21
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:17,597
What's with Number 511?

22
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,474
Don't we require a bachelor's degree?

23
00:02:19,557 --> 00:02:20,433
I apologize.

24
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:23,061
There must've been a mistake
during the resume screening process.

25
00:02:32,487 --> 00:02:34,197
Hello, I am interviewee number 511,

26
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,448
Cheon Sa-rang.

27
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:40,036
2015 KING HOTEL TRAINEESHIP INTERVIEW

28
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,055
Your hobby is playing the piano.

29
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,848
{\an8}Can you play for us?

30
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:02,767
{\an8}- Right now?
- Yes, right now.

31
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,105
But there's no piano here.

32
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:08,481
I know, right?

33
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:29,210
{\an8}INTERVIEWER

34
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,841
{\an8}INTERVIEWER

35
00:03:45,977 --> 00:03:47,436
{\an8}Your hobby is playing the piano,

36
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:49,605
{\an8}yet you played "Chopsticks."

37
00:03:50,523 --> 00:03:52,150
It's my hobby, not my specialty.

38
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:54,193
I'm not that good, but I enjoy playing.

39
00:03:56,988 --> 00:03:58,197
Can you smile for us?

40
00:04:15,423 --> 00:04:16,424
{\an8}Hey.

41
00:04:19,886 --> 00:04:21,137
{\an8}You really did that?

42
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,222
{\an8}Yes. What else was I supposed to do?

43
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:25,391
{\an8}But still, it was King Hotel.

44
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:27,685
{\an8}You should've at least
played something by Beethoven.

45
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:33,399
{\an8}Wonderful.

46
00:04:33,483 --> 00:04:34,650
{\an8}You pass.

47
00:04:34,734 --> 00:04:37,570
{\an8}Thank you, ma'am. I'll work hard.

48
00:04:38,196 --> 00:04:41,407
{\an8}Hey, Beethoven or Mozart.
None of that matters.

49
00:04:41,491 --> 00:04:44,660
They require bachelor's degrees
from mere one-month trainees.

50
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:46,996
Then why did you go for the interview?

51
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,039
Just because.

52
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:50,458
I wondered how Korea's best hotel
conducted their interviews.

53
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:53,461
If you've satisfied your curiosity,
join me at the duty-free shop.

54
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:55,963
Don't listen to her.
Be a flight attendant with me.

55
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:59,217
No, I'm going to work in a hotel.

56
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,801
Come on. Why?

57
00:05:00,885 --> 00:05:02,136
I just like hotels.

58
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,139
More than you like me?

59
00:05:05,723 --> 00:05:08,267
Hey, you like nightclubs
more than you like me.

60
00:05:10,436 --> 00:05:11,521
How upsetting.

61
00:05:11,604 --> 00:05:13,147
How could you say that?

62
00:05:13,231 --> 00:05:14,273
It can't be helped.

63
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:16,275
Let's go clubbing.

64
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:18,027
Right now?

65
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,320
Let's go where?

66
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:21,656
- Let's go!
- What are you talking about?

67
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:23,366
Excuse me.

68
00:05:24,075 --> 00:05:25,743
I've been watching you for a while.

69
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,411
Would you care for a drink?

70
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:40,174
I'm sorry.

71
00:05:40,258 --> 00:05:43,094
We were in the middle
of something important.

72
00:05:44,387 --> 00:05:46,055
You can just give me your number.

73
00:05:47,473 --> 00:05:48,516
Hey.

74
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:54,814
There we go.

75
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:57,650
I'll get in touch with you.

76
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:03,531
Hey, why would you
give your number to a stranger?

77
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:05,992
What do you mean by "stranger"?
We're acquainted now.

78
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:08,703
Didn't I tell you to start a relationship
after you developed feelings

79
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:10,079
instead of regretting it later?

80
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:12,415
Hey, love doesn't happen in stages.

81
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm dying to know

82
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,252
who you'll get married to
with that mindset.

83
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:17,878
Are you crazy?

84
00:06:17,962 --> 00:06:20,589
Why would I settle with one person
for the rest of my life?

85
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:23,467
Even the thought is frightening. Let's go.

86
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:24,427
Let's go.

87
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:27,680
I'll pass. I'm so tired.

88
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:29,682
- That's why you go clubbing.
- I mean…

89
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:33,227
You just got off your flight.
You should get some rest.

90
00:06:33,311 --> 00:06:35,313
No sleep at all is better
than just a few hours.

91
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:36,230
Grab her.

92
00:06:37,315 --> 00:06:39,984
- I'm not in the mood today.
- Goodness.

93
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,402
I'm feeling pumped already.

94
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:53,806
Who is it?

95
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,603
Hello?

96
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,691
Yes, I'm Number 511, Cheon Sa-rang.

97
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:07,654
Sorry?

98
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:09,447
Really?

99
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,450
I did?

100
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:13,576
But why?

101
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:17,205
No, that's not what I meant.

102
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:20,083
Okay, thank you.

103
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,097
Why? What's wrong?

104
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,139
What's the matter?

105
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,307
I passed.

106
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:41,479
I got an offer from King Hotel!

107
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,109
Congratulations, Sa-rang!

108
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,975
- Hello?
- <i>You landed in the wrong place.</i>

109
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,312
- Sorry?
- <i>It's the building next to you.</i>

110
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:53,069
Over here!

111
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,947
Over here!

112
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,699
Over here!

113
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,660
Over here!

114
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,914
EPISODE 1

115
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,046
The most important quality of an intern

116
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,632
is not how good they are at their job.

117
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,134
It's having common sense.

118
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,929
No matter how nimble you are
or how hard you work,

119
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,223
it's over for you
if people find you thoughtless.

120
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:23,141
The end.

121
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:26,144
Consider arriving late
on your first day of work

122
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,980
and saying, "I thought it was
the building next door."

123
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,773
What ridiculous excuse is that?

124
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:31,983
What are you…

125
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,652
Where did you buy your shoes?

126
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,447
I bought them in Milan.

127
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,490
Milan?

128
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,119
A three-piece suit and shoes from Milan.

129
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,954
You could be mistaken for a nobleman.

130
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,789
- You should laugh along.
- Yes, sir.

131
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,750
You need to laugh now
if you want to be seen as mindful.

132
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:53,254
All right. Starting now,
I'll teach you what it means to have…

133
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,631
This is fake, isn't it?

134
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:56,716
No.

135
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,050
It's authentic?

136
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,845
Look at you. Goodness. Hold on.

137
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,686
How much does your outfit cost?

138
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:09,812
Are you a chaebol?

139
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:11,731
Well…

140
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,026
- No.
- See? I knew it.

141
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:15,985
Look at you.

142
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,570
He's acting like one.

143
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:20,156
You're on the path of self-destruction.

144
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,325
This is what you call being thoughtless.

145
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,618
While you're in my charge,

146
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,912
don't think of doing anything
and just follow my orders.

147
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,830
- Yes, sir.
- Louder. Got it?

148
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,332
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

149
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,499
{\an8}SALES SUPPORT TEAM
INTERN GU WON

150
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:39,884
This is your first internship, right?

151
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,093
Don't be late tomorrow.

152
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,511
I wasn't late.

153
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,723
If you come to work on the dot,
it means you're late.

154
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:48,100
Come to work
at least 30 minutes early. Got it?

155
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,979
But why are you speaking so casually?

156
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:53,731
Because we're coworkers.

157
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,859
We have to get through
this unfriendly world together.

158
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,570
Don't just sit there.
Uncross your legs and do something.

159
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:02,073
Do what? There's nothing to do.

160
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,825
You still have to act
like you're doing something.

161
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:08,037
Here. I'll give you a calculator,
so press some buttons.

162
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,330
I said uncross your legs.

163
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:10,665
And you heard him earlier, right?

164
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,792
You shouldn't wear
expensive suits or watches.

165
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,752
Wear something old like mine if you must.

166
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,879
Do I have to? Why?

167
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,508
Wearing something more expensive
than your superiors is considered mutiny.

168
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,301
You can flaunt your money outside of work.

169
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:23,678
I never flaunted it.

170
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,846
My goodness. You're absolutely clueless.

171
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,433
One would think
you were parachuted into the job.

172
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:31,727
You're right.

173
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,437
I parachuted here.

174
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,064
What?

175
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,358
I had to rush in from Jeju Island.

176
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:39,443
Is there something wrong?

177
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,362
You're driving me crazy.

178
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:45,324
Listen carefully.

179
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,743
This is my fifth internship.

180
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,161
If you keep acting like this,

181
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:53,040
you won't even be able to land a job
as a contract worker. Get it together.

182
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:55,251
- Interns!
- Yes, sir. No Sang-sik reporting.

183
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,336
- Interns.
- Yes, No Sang-sik here.

184
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,504
Why did you come alone?

185
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,089
- Did we only hire one intern?
- No, sir.

186
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,799
I thought you were just calling me.

187
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:03,509
Where are you going? Just call him.

188
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:05,344
- Right.
- What are you doing?

189
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,853
What? What is he doing?

190
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,730
He needs to sit when he works, you see.

191
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,898
Goodness. He got up.

192
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,316
Look at how relaxed he is.

193
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,694
How cool. I thought you were the chairman.

194
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,488
It's because this is his first internship.

195
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:25,823
I'll help him out.

196
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,700
- Yes, please help me out too.
- Yes, sir.

197
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:28,826
- To general affairs.
- Yes, sir.

198
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,995
And make three copies of each.

199
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,540
Take your hand out of your pocket.

200
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,209
Make copies. Yes, sir. Here.

201
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,003
Go.

202
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:42,006
HOW TO USE A COPIER

203
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,721
You're still not done?

204
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,724
I didn't know how to use this,
so I was looking it up.

205
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,267
How could you not know that?

206
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:55,644
Since I've never used it before.

207
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,271
Are you a young master or what?

208
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,648
Have your servants
been doing these chores for you?

209
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,235
Also, this is the scanner. Don't use this.

210
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,279
Look. Just press this button.

211
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:07,156
We have to replace the toner cartridge.

212
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,284
- Interns, what are you doing here?
- Yes, sir?

213
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,870
It says we need to
replace the toner cartridge.

214
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:15,664
Gosh, we asked for a new machine ages ago.

215
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,750
The machine has a sensor issue.
Just give it a shake.

216
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,168
- Shake it?
- Yes, shake it.

217
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:20,669
Yes, sir.

218
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,047
How cute. Are you going to be that gentle?

219
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,674
- Shake vigorously.
- What if it explodes?

220
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,718
- I said, shake it vigorously.
- Yes, sir.

221
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:29,261
- That's it. Good job.
- Yes, sir.

222
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,262
- More.
- Yes, sir.

223
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,932
- More.
- More.

224
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:36,102
- More.
- More.

225
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,497
Darn it. Who messed with the copier?

226
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,709
My goodness. I can't believe you guys.

227
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,545
You're driving me insane.

228
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,879
- Who was it?
- Darn it.

229
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,716
I'm sorry.

230
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,009
I was told to shake it so…

231
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,095
That's not even that expensive.

232
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:13,389
You could've just gotten a new one.

233
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,808
Are we living in the '80s?
Why would you shake that?

234
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,643
Well, the thing is…

235
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:20,855
You have a lot to say
after causing trouble. Just be quiet.

236
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:22,773
I'm sorry.

237
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:25,317
Why did they hire a blockhead like you?

238
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,695
- Clean the mess!
- Yes, sir.

239
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,156
Why are you sorry?
You didn't do anything wrong.

240
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,533
Of course I'm at fault.

241
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,618
- It's all my fault. Why…
- How so?

242
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,246
Hey.

243
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,415
What did you just say?

244
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,334
I said it wasn't
Intern No Sang-sik's fault.

245
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,294
Why not?

246
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:46,464
He just followed orders
because he was told to.

247
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,340
If it resulted in a negative outcome,

248
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,385
isn't the person
who gave the order at fault?

249
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:53,471
Stop it.

250
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,681
- What?
- I believe it's not right

251
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:58,100
to blame your juniors
without determining the cause.

252
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,269
Also, this only happened

253
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,980
because the copier was not replaced
when it should've been.

254
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,025
So the company is most at fault.

255
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,360
How dare an intern criticize the company?

256
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:11,197
Even a mere intern
can tell right from wrong.

257
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,157
- Darn you.
- I'm sorry.

258
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:16,368
This punk has no sense in him.

259
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,580
Clean up this mess at once and get lost.

260
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,665
And don't come to work starting tomorrow.

261
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:23,751
No, I have to come to work.

262
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:24,877
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

263
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,213
- I'll do that.
- What?

264
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,255
You'll what?

265
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,423
Don't move! Where are you going?

266
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,968
- You said to clean up the mess.
- Yes, right here.

267
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:36,555
Hello, it's me.

268
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,808
Can you send some cleaners
to the sales support team?

269
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,144
Yes.

270
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,230
The copier also needs to be replaced.

271
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,314
All right.

272
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,984
- He said he'll send them.
- Who?

273
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,528
The cleaners.

274
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,529
Who said that?

275
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,489
- Director Choi.
- Director Choi?

276
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,698
By Director Choi…

277
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,285
The only Director Choi here

278
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:02,248
is the one who works
in the chairman's secretary's office.

279
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:03,999
That's right.

280
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:08,128
If you don't mind me asking, who are you?

281
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:12,883
I'm an intern,

282
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,302
and my name is Gu Won.

283
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,431
Gu Won?

284
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:22,059
Then are you Chairman Gu Il-hun's…

285
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:24,353
That's right.

286
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,022
Goodness.

287
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:30,150
Goodness, you look amazing in this suit.

288
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,652
Then I guess

289
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:34,363
I won't come to work
starting tomorrow as you ordered.

290
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,490
No, ignore what I said. I'm sorry.

291
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:38,450
Don't apologize. I'm a mere intern.

292
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,411
I just need to do as I'm told.

293
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:43,539
Excuse me, Mr. Choi.

294
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,165
Choi Tae-man at your service.

295
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,625
Thanks to you,

296
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,753
I now have a good grasp of
what thoughtlessness is.

297
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,005
I'll be born again.

298
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,923
Hello, Mr. Choi.

299
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:54,341
What's wrong with the copier?

300
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,802
Are you hurt anywhere?

301
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,930
I'm fine. Please just handle the mess.

302
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:00,973
Hold on.

303
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:03,809
I was told to
manage your attendance strictly.

304
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,979
If you leave now,
the chairman will be furious.

305
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,314
I just…

306
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:10,649
got fired.

307
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,818
- No, it was a joke.
- I'm leaving.

308
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:15,696
Won.

309
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,573
You come over here.

310
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,741
- It's all your fault!
- I'm sorry.

311
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,909
- Why did you have to shake that?
- I'm sorry.

312
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,578
I can't get fired though.

313
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,121
- I need to stay here.
- I can't believe this.

314
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:27,207
I didn't know
that shaking the cartridge would…

315
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,084
You're back, sir.

316
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,211
Do you want to go with me?

317
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:35,299
- Me?
- As coworkers,

318
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:37,384
we need to get through
this unfriendly world together.

319
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:40,429
You said staying here won't even
guarantee you a contract position.

320
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:43,307
Come with me
and you'll get a full-time position.

321
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:52,274
I will serve you
with my utmost sincerity, sir.

322
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:57,029
- Do I need to clean this?
- I'll take care of it.

323
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,030
- Okay, then.
- Sure.

324
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,782
- Here you go.
- You may give it to me.

325
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,700
- I hope you'll be born again.
- Thank you.

326
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:03,827
Let's go, sir.

327
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,705
Coming through. Please make way.

328
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:09,124
- Gosh, why did you…
- <i>Are you in your right mind?!</i>

329
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,752
I told you to learn from the bottom up.

330
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,212
And you left on the first day?

331
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,340
I didn't choose to leave.
I got kicked out.

332
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:18,842
Either way, I already told you
that I'm not cut out for this.

333
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,803
I'll go back to the UK.

334
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,262
- What will you do there?
- Dad.

335
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,639
That's enough.

336
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:27,142
He can start slowly after studying more.

337
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,645
And I know it's good
to start from the bottom,

338
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,397
but an intern was too much.

339
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,607
Why can't you be
half as good as your sister?

340
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,776
Who does he take after?

341
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:38,487
Don't be too harsh on him.
I'll try talking to him.

342
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,782
Can we talk?

343
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,704
Go to the hotel.

344
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,205
It's a hassle.

345
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,124
I'll stay here tonight.

346
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:52,835
Who are you to stay here?

347
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:58,132
Don't be mistaken.

348
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,633
This isn't your house.

349
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:04,805
You're right.

350
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:06,640
I forgot for a second.

351
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,309
Stay at the hotel
and fly out as soon as possible.

352
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,395
Whatever you choose to do,

353
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,021
I'll support you financially.

354
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,650
So don't even think about
lurking around the house or the company.

355
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,074
You know,

356
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,076
I'm loaded too.

357
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,206
But thanks for looking after me.

358
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,626
You almost moved me for a second.

359
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:50,726
Where's Won?

360
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,978
He said he'd stay at the hotel
for the time being.

361
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,606
I insisted that he should at least eat.

362
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,151
That imbecile.

363
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:02,404
That wasn't even an earful,
but he ran away without eating.

364
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,031
He still has a long way to go.

365
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,825
If you keep tugging,
he'll only run farther away.

366
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,787
Letting him be
might be a good option for now.

367
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,539
All right.

368
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:16,293
Make sure you don't
give him a hard time either.

369
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,204
The guest is what?

370
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,831
- The guest is king.
- The guest is king.

371
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:20,167
That's right. The guest is king.

372
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,168
Why?

373
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,754
Because guests pay
service charges at hotels.

374
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:27,090
Because of that, it is our duty
to treat our guests like the king,

375
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:30,218
and it gives them the right
to be treated like one as well.

376
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,387
We aim to provide the guests
with satisfactory service

377
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,765
as well as to move their hearts.

378
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:38,310
We have to forget about our emotions
for the sake of our guests.

379
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,313
If you feel you're not up to it,
you may leave now.

380
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:45,484
No one?

381
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,444
Are you all ready to serve the king?

382
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:48,403
- Yes.
- Yes.

383
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,739
Quality customer service
starts with a smile.

384
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:53,909
This is the high-end smile
that only King Hotel offers.

385
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:55,702
Hermès!

386
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:57,162
- Hermès!
- Hermès!

387
00:24:57,245 --> 00:25:00,624
A smile is the greatest sword and shield.

388
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:03,085
Beautifully, Hermès!

389
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,087
- Hermès!
- Hermès!

390
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,220
Hello, Manager Kim.

391
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:14,763
What's wrong with the floor?

392
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,014
We just cleaned it.

393
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:18,433
Clean it again and again
until it's sparkling clean.

394
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,352
She's a trainee.

395
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:22,604
Hello, I'm Cheon Sa-rang.

396
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,814
I'll take a look around.

397
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:26,233
- Teach her from A to Z.
- Yes, ma'am.

398
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,783
You're uselessly pretty
for a one-month trainee.

399
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:38,161
- Pardon?
- You'll be gone in a month.

400
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,538
Go and wipe the butt sweat.

401
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,331
"Butt sweat"?

402
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,166
If you go over there,

403
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,128
you'll see the beautiful butt sweat
left by our guests.

404
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,088
You'll be in charge of that for a month,

405
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:50,757
so don't miss a single drop
and wipe until it's sparkling clean.

406
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,217
Yes, ma'am.

407
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,478
Hey you.

408
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:05,063
Hermès!

409
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:06,898
Hermès!

410
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,494
Hermès.

411
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,246
Hermès.

412
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,918
Cotton swabs and cotton pads
should be filled to 90%.

413
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,795
It's difficult to take one out at 100%.

414
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:31,256
Anything under 90%
makes it look like we don't care.

415
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,300
Yes, ma'am.

416
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,344
Why are you so smiley?

417
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:39,264
I was taught to maintain
my Hermès smile while working.

418
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:40,807
That applies to concierges.

419
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:42,476
We still work in the hotel.

420
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,978
The true hotel working experience
starts in the lobby.

421
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:47,481
We wear sportswear
while they wear uniforms.

422
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:51,359
Plus, you're only here for a month.
You don't need to get used to Hermès.

423
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,404
I should still try my best while I'm here.

424
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:55,530
Try all you want.

425
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:58,575
No matter what happens,
you won't be able to go near the lobby.

426
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:01,745
Even I've been stuck here for five years.

427
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,663
At least you're a full-time worker.

428
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:07,292
Well…

429
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:09,836
I'm better than you in every aspect.

430
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:14,466
If you're done here, go out and wipe
until everything's sparkling clean.

431
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:17,260
Okay. I'll wipe
until everything's sparkling clean.

432
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:23,350
Let's get up early tomorrow
so we can eat something before our flight.

433
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:26,561
Pyeong-hwa, look up some famous places
nearby and make a reservation.

434
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,396
We have the hotel breakfast reserved.

435
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,606
I asked for a famous restaurant.

436
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:31,399
Find a rare restaurant with food

437
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,818
that is unique to this place.

438
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:36,321
Yes, ma'am.
I will look for a rare restaurant.

439
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:37,781
We're checked in.

440
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,660
Who wants to share a room with me?

441
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:46,998
Then should I choose?

442
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:52,963
<i>Who will share a room with me?</i>

443
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:58,218
<i>I wonder who it will be</i>

444
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,720
<i>Eeny, meeny, miny…</i>

445
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:04,558
<i>moe!</i>

446
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,226
You win!

447
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:14,985
Be done in ten minutes.

448
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,736
Don't use the restroom while I'm sleeping.

449
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,238
- Yes, ma'am.
- Unplug all the TV

450
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:19,364
and fridge cables.

451
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:21,408
I can't sleep if it's noisy. Understood?

452
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:23,201
Yes, ma'am. I…

453
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:28,874
RARE RESTAURANTS IN JEJU ISLAND

454
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:33,086
Didn't I tell you that I'm sensitive?

455
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:35,088
I could sense the electromagnetic waves.

456
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:36,882
I'm sorry.

457
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:39,175
- Turn off your phone.
- I put it on silent.

458
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,844
I can sense that too.

459
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:12,292
Thank you. Please come again next time.

460
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:15,712
- Da-eul.
- Yes?

461
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:18,173
The manager said
she doesn't like the cafeteria menu.

462
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,175
She wants some <i>gimbap</i> to eat in the back.

463
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,260
All right. I'll be right back.

464
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,183
Sorry. Coming through.

465
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,311
One tuna, two beef,

466
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:33,438
and one kimchi rice ball to go.

467
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:35,232
Okay, I got your order.

468
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:39,236
I'm really sorry, but in the tuna <i>gimbap</i>,
could you please reduce the rice,

469
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,987
add a lot of tuna and mayonnaise,

470
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:42,822
and take out the spinach?

471
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,075
Sure.

472
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:49,579
I'm really sorry again,
but for one of the beef <i>gimbap</i>,

473
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:52,415
can you leave out
the sesame oil and carrots?

474
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,417
Why don't you make it yourself?

475
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:57,254
I'm sorry. My seniors are picky eaters.

476
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,506
Just for today. I can't cater to
your needs when I'm busy.

477
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:00,882
Thank you so much.

478
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:03,134
I'm really sorry again…

479
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:05,095
- What now?
- Along with the other requests,

480
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:07,180
for the other beef <i>gimbap</i>,
can you take out the eggs

481
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:10,475
and apply the right amount of sesame oil
to make it give off a slight scent?

482
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:12,852
- Get out. I'm done with you.
- I'm sorry.

483
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:14,187
Please help me out.

484
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:16,231
- I need to buy the <i>gimbap</i>.
- Get out!

485
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,440
I'll make them.

486
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:20,068
At least allow me to make them. Please.

487
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,862
Excuse me. Sorry.

488
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,786
I'm back. I'll get everything ready.

489
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,955
The manager went to the cafeteria.

490
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,164
Sorry?

491
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:34,874
What about these?

492
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,837
Didn't you hear me? She wants
the pork cutlet from the cafeteria.

493
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:41,923
Let's go.

494
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:57,522
Where's the water?

495
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:01,985
- Hello.
- Hello.

496
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:03,570
- This is Alanga.
- This is King Hotel.

497
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:05,363
- Over there.
- Yes, ma'am.

498
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,288
Apologizing doesn't solve the problem!

499
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,374
Welcome. May I check your boarding pass?

500
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:19,836
Coming!

501
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:04,714
I can't believe my eyes.

502
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:07,842
Sir, I'm here.

503
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:11,763
Next.

504
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,644
Are you purchasing your clothes here?

505
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,188
Why would I bother shopping in person?

506
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:23,650
The comfort of the rich is beautiful.

507
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:28,071
What do you think of this?
There are only three in the nation.

508
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:30,490
Give me all three.

509
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:33,368
I'm sorry, but one has already been sold.

510
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,078
Then give me the remaining two.

511
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:36,788
I'm okay.

512
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,124
Matching shirts seems a bit too much.

513
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,834
I appreciate your gesture though.

514
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:41,793
Matching shirts?

515
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:42,794
Why would I?

516
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,712
Weren't you going to give one to me?

517
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:45,880
Both of them are mine.

518
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:50,093
Also, I hate it when someone else wears
the same thing as me.

519
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,262
Just go and get ready for the UK.

520
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:54,055
We're leaving in a week.

521
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:55,640
Be prepared not to come back.

522
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,350
The UK all of a sudden?

523
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:59,436
I don't have a passport.

524
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:02,188
Is that even possible?

525
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:03,481
Have you never been abroad?

526
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:05,525
I never had the opportunity to do so.

527
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:07,235
I was busy interning.

528
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,903
Apply for a passport this instant.

529
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:14,159
By the way, sir,
will I really become a full-time employee?

530
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:17,412
What if I follow you
and end up hanging in the wind?

531
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:19,622
Hello?

532
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,499
It's me.

533
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,502
Can you promote No Sang-sik
to a full-time position?

534
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:25,712
Yes, thank you.

535
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:27,255
Happy now?

536
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,423
Of course, sir.

537
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:49,611
Hello.

538
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,988
I'm the front desk manager, Kim Su-mi.

539
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,072
Yes. And?

540
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:55,658
I heard that you're returning to the UK.

541
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,869
Already? Even I just found out.

542
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:59,704
Well, you're very famous.

543
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:00,705
I see.

544
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,543
I am pretty popular,
which could be a bother at times.

545
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:09,714
Please feel free to give me a call
if you need anything before you leave.

546
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:13,176
I'll help you right away if you call me
directly, and not the front desk.

547
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,472
Is there something in your eye?

548
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,724
- No.
- All right, then.

549
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,278
As expected from the chairman's son.

550
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,364
He's nonchalant.

551
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,366
He's so charming.

552
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,012
Good work.

553
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,305
- Good work.
- Excuse me, sir.

554
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,182
Can you please keep it down?

555
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,268
- What?
- Other guests keep complaining.

556
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:46,519
Please cooperate with me.

557
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:48,104
This is my routine.

558
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:49,439
I apologize, sir.

559
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:51,816
Ms. Park Bo-yeon?

560
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:55,278
You have a refreshing way of approach.

561
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:56,738
- You like me, don't you?
- Pardon?

562
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,031
I'm afraid I have bad news.

563
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,449
You're not my type.

564
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,618
She's my type.

565
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,040
Hey.

566
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:07,957
Here.

567
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,043
Do I have to deliver your tips to you?

568
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,169
Sorry?

569
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:12,420
It's from the tiger back.

570
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,798
You're really something.
You're already being tipped.

571
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:18,635
Tiger?

572
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,490
<i>I noticed you following me around.</i>

573
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,992
I'll accept your cunning advances.

574
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:46,412
This is for our steamy night together.

575
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:55,088
What a pervert.

576
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,340
How disgusting.

577
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:07,725
That darn butt sweat!

578
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,287
Excuse me, sir.

579
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,334
Sir?

580
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:41,801


581
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:43,010
Why is this…

582
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,221
Hey--

583
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,606
Sir, do you think I'm a joke
because I wipe people's butt sweat?

584
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,484
That doesn't give people like you,
who have poop for brains,

585
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:00,737
the right to walk over me.

586
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:02,989
If you ever do this again,

587
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,699
I'm going to kill you.

588
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:07,452
Please keep that in mind, Mr. Pervert.

589
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:12,331
What in the world…

590
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:15,001
Excuse me. Stop right there.

591
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:17,837
Did you not hear me?

592
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:19,756
- Hey!
- What are you doing?

593
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:25,178
This space is for members
and hotel guests.

594
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:27,430
Who are you
to raise your voice in my hotel?

595
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,599
It's not your hotel yet.

596
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:32,059
- What?
- I'm also a guest.

597
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:34,353
A guest who rooms in a suite at that.

598
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,857
If I file a complaint,
it'll only get uncomfortable for us both.

599
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:41,068
Why don't you be more polite
to your guest,

600
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:42,862
Director of King Hotel?

601
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,534
I'll leave as soon as I'm ready.

602
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:53,998
So please try to treat me
like a guest while I'm here.

603
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,363
Hello, Ms. Gu.

604
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,406
What brings you here without notice?

605
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,533
Am I not allowed here?

606
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,993
Of course not. This entire hotel is yours.

607
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:33,746
Hello.

608
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:35,957
How's the work treating you?

609
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,839
It's a bit tough since it's my first time,
but I find pleasure in learning.

610
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,757
Thank you for hiring me.

611
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:45,883
I will do my best.

612
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,845
- Did you go through all the training?
- Yes.

613
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,680
I received basic training.

614
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:52,139
What are the deposit precautions?

615
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,224
I'm sorry.

616
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:56,310
She's a trainee,
so she hasn't been taught that yet.

617
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,438
The deposit precautions are to check
if the name on the reservation

618
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:01,148
matches the name on the card

619
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:04,193
and to check if there's a signature
on the back of the card.

620
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:07,780
- What is happy hour?
- It is a period during slow hours

621
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:10,449
in which the price of snacks and drinks

622
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:11,993
are reduced or served free

623
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,704
in venues such as the lounge
or cocktail bar.

624
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:16,038
Inform me in English.

625
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:19,500
{\an8}Happy hours are from 3 to 5 p.m.,
and please, feel free

626
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:22,753
{\an8}to have complimentary snacks and drinks
at the hotel lounge.

627
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,132
Promote her to the lobby.

628
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:28,217
Pardon?

629
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:40,062
Excuse me, Ms. Gu.

630
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,356
She graduated from a two-year college.

631
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,191
Why would you leave
a competent girl to rot?

632
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,735
She needs to be seen.

633
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,862
She's a one-month trainee. Are you sure?

634
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:50,990
- Then let her stay for a year.
- Sorry?

635
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:53,367
The lobby is the face of the hotel.

636
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,203
She has a nice smile.

637
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:13,137
Everyone here can speak English
as well as you.

638
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,890
You should be able to speak
at least two foreign languages.

639
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,475
You can't speak Chinese, can you?

640
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:20,269
{\an8}From 3 to 5 p.m.,
the hotel lounge will offer

641
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:24,273
{\an8}complimentary snacks, coffee, and tea.
Please feel free to enjoy them.

642
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,902
At this rate,
you might even speak Japanese.

643
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:30,696
{\an8}From 3 to 5 p.m.,
the hotel lounge will offer

644
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,824
{\an8}complimentary snacks, coffee, and tea.

645
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,785
{\an8}Please feel free to enjoy them.

646
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:43,417
It's always been my dream to become
a concierge, so I studied hard.

647
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,169
Foreign languages aren't everything.

648
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:49,090
The lobby isn't a place
for someone like you.

649
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,592
"Someone like me," ma'am?

650
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:53,928
You're uneducated, incompetent…

651
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,264
and unattractive.

652
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,058
Must I spell it out for you?

653
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:01,102
So don't show off and just do as I say.

654
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,061
Do you understand?

655
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,523
Yes, I'll do anything you ask
to the best of my ability.

656
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:07,233
Thank you.

657
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:31,966
FATHER

658
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:38,681
You just barged into a guest's room.

659
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:40,016
It's past your checkout time.

660
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:42,101
- Get out.
- I will.

661
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:45,521
You don't have to call Father.
I'll let him know.

662
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:49,400
The services at this hotel are great.

663
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:50,985
I'm the owner, after all.

664
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,613
Why don't you just settle down there?

665
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,657
Coming back will only
make things harder for you.

666
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:00,786
That's for me to decide.

667
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:02,955
But

668
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,665
I definitely won't be coming back,

669
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,292
so don't worry.

670
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:07,710
I hope you'll keep your word.

671
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:12,590
Bye.

672
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,101
<i>- Congratulations
- Congratulations</i>

673
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:49,186
<i>- Congratulations
- Congratulations</i>

674
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:51,313
<i>- You now work in the lobby
- You now work in the lobby</i>

675
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:53,065
<i>- Congratulations
- Congratulations</i>

676
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:59,446
- Thank you.
- Congrats.

677
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,699
You went from wiping butt sweat
to working in the lobby.

678
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:04,034
Goodness, I'm so proud of you.

679
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:05,661
So triumphs the human spirit.

680
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:09,248
You're the first two-year college graduate
to become King Hotel's full-time employee.

681
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:11,458
My term has just been extended by a year.

682
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:12,918
Hence,

683
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:14,461
the "almost full-time employee."

684
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:17,381
One year will become two,
and two years will become three.

685
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:20,551
In a few years,
we'll become cool seniors, right?

686
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:21,635
Probably.

687
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:25,306
But where in the world
are those cool seniors?

688
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:28,392
I'm only surrounded by a bunch
of mothers-in-law on power trips.

689
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:30,477
We can become cool seniors.

690
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:33,397
I swear I'm not going to end up
like my seniors.

691
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,315
You're right.

692
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:37,443
Let's not turn into old witches.

693
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:39,236
I don't want to become like them.

694
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:44,533
Why are you so quiet?

695
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:46,619
I don't have any wishes.

696
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:48,871
I'd be thankful
if no one gets on my nerves.

697
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:51,498
This won't do.

698
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:54,501
You need to go to a world
filled with hopes and dreams.

699
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,004
Where might that be?

700
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:59,131
Club Gold.

701
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:01,675
I'm a VIP.

702
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:04,595
Everything is on me tonight!

703
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:06,889
Come on!

704
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:09,266
Come on! I need you to be louder!

705
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:10,851
{\an8}Let me hear you scream!

706
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:53,686
{\an8}Thank you.

707
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:57,147
Thank you.

KING HOTEL BEST TALENT AWARD

<i>I can't believe you left me</i>

710
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:30,139
<i>I can't believe you abandoned me</i>

711
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:34,018
<i>It's hard to forget about
Our deeply-engraved memories…</i>

712
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:20,939
{\an8}You are constantly the best student
I've ever had.

713

ACTUAL FULL-TIME EMPLOYEE

714
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:30,407
Congratulations!

715
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:32,576
You're finally
an actual full-time employee.

716
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:33,702
All right.

717
00:48:33,786 --> 00:48:35,370
To your full-time employment.

718
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:37,498
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

719
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:48,592
THE PRESENT

720
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:25,087
{\an8}Good morning, sir.

721
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:27,047
{\an8}I trust that you had a good trip.

722
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:30,884
{\an8}A package has arrived, sir.
It is addressed to this house

723
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,886
{\an8}but the name is not in English.

724
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,555
{\an8}Would you care to take a look?

725
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,182
{\an8}It is for me, but

726
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:38,851
{\an8}it does not say who is this from.

727
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:41,520
{\an8}- How was it delivered?
- It was delivered by

728
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:42,813
{\an8}a motorcycle courier, sir.

729
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:44,273
{\an8}He did not know the sender.

730
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:47,651
{\an8}I'll make some tea
for your room, sir.

731
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:50,654
{\an8}If there's anything else you'd like,
just let me know.

732
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:51,697
{\an8}Okay.

PERSONNEL RECORD
HAN MI-SO

734
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:55,594
It's me.

735
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:57,346
Book a flight to Korea at once.

736
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,389
Korea?

737
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:00,557
Out of the blue?

738
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:06,104
Something came up.

739
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,316
But my parents are visiting this week.

740
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:10,943
Can we go next week?

741
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,819
I'll go first then. You can come later.

742
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,905
<i>No, we need to go together.</i>

743
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:17,074
<i>We promised
to stick together for eternity.</i>

744
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:18,533
How long will you stay in Korea?

745
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:19,868
I don't know.

746
00:51:19,952 --> 00:51:21,703
But I need to know that to pack my things.

747
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:23,997
You can just buy
your clothes and shoes in Korea,

748
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,582
<i>but I need to take my things.</i>

749
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:28,585
Okay then. Get packed in ten minutes
and meet me at the airport.

750
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:30,837
Then will you buy me new clothes
and shoes in Korea?

751
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:32,547
He hung up.

752
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:33,632
Sorry.

{\an8}KING HOTEL CONCIERGE TRAINEESHIP PROGRAM

754
00:51:56,989 --> 00:51:59,533
Congratulations on taking your first step
as a concierge.

755
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:01,618
I'm Cheon Sa-rang,
who will be in charge of the training.

756
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:08,250
The fundamental

757
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:11,545
of a King Hotel employee is
to love and show kindness to our guests.

758
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:14,506
Welcoming the guests
wholeheartedly comes first,

759
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:16,883
and expressing it
is the service we offer here.

760
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:20,637
In other words,
insincere kindness is not true kindness.

761
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,432
We need to be ready

762
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:26,351
to put on a genuine smile at all times.

763
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:28,562
Hey!

764
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:33,734
Ms. Cheon Sa-rang?

765
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:35,944
What happened?
What exactly did you do wrong?

766
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:39,489
- Me?
- What did you do

767
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:42,534
for a suite guest to come down
to the lobby and look for you?

768
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:44,077
Are you sure you didn't make a mistake?

769
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:46,121
No.

770
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:49,207
I even made a wake-up call this morning.

771
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:50,167
Hurry over.

772
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:52,377
Make sure the complaint
doesn't come to my end.

773
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:53,837
Is that clear?

774
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:54,796
Yes, ma'am.

775
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:02,387
You guys can practice smiling.

776
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:04,097
Hermès!

777
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,349
- Hermès!
- Hermès!

778
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:16,193
{\an8}How may I help you, ma'am?

779
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:18,528
{\an8}I'm in charge of the reception desk
at the moment.

780
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:20,781
{\an8}Are you the one that made
my wake-up call this morning?

781
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:23,492
{\an8}Yes, I did. At the time you requested.

782
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:25,702
{\an8}So, you knew who I am?

783
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:29,122
{\an8}How could any music lover right now
recognize you?

784
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:32,876
{\an8}It's a great honor to have you stay
at our hotel.

785
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:44,763
{\an8}<i>I've had countless wake-up calls
from hotels all around the world.</i>

786
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:56,149
{\an8}<i>But it was the first time</i>

787
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:59,403
{\an8}<i>I woke up hearing the aria that I sang.</i>

788
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:02,989
{\an8}<i>It's been a few years
since I left the stage.</i>

789
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:07,244
{\an8}<i>But it seemed as if
I'd become a prima donna again.</i>

790
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:08,453
{\an8}<i>Thank you, dear,</i>

791
00:54:08,537 --> 00:54:10,664
{\an8}for taking me back to days of my youth.

792
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:14,709
{\an8}Thank you for remembering me
after all these years.

793
00:54:15,544 --> 00:54:18,713
{\an8}Now it's my turn to keep you
in my memory, Ms...

794
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:21,591
{\an8}Sa-rang.

795
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:01,882
How does it feel to come back
to Korea after a while?

796
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:03,675
It's the same.

797
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:06,344
Don't think of leaving again.

798
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:07,596
Start working.

799
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:10,724
Hotel, Air, or Distribution?
Which do you prefer?

800
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:13,185
He's just visiting.
You're getting ahead of yourself.

801
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:15,312
He's not done with his studies either.

802
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:17,606
It won't be late
even if he takes his time.

803
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:18,899
Seven years was more than enough.

804
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:21,735
Since we're on the topic,
move back to Korea.

805
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:25,739
I'll start working.

806
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:27,866
What?

807
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:30,368
But I want to work at the hotel.

808
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:33,663
What's your reason?

809
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:35,457
I like hotels.

810
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:38,460
All right.

811
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:39,503
Go ahead.

812
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:42,422
Okay. Let's have a drink.

813
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:46,092
I'm delighted to see
our family gathered like this.

814
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:49,638
You probably can't even imagine

815
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,098
how long I've waited for this day to come.

816
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:55,310
Won, you'll need to climb up the ladder
by competing with your sister.

817
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:56,603
What do you mean?

818
00:55:57,604 --> 00:56:00,106
Won is just now starting out.
I should help him.

819
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:03,318
Both providing and receiving help
reflect competence.

820
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:05,862
I'm only going to consider
your competence from now on.

821
00:56:05,946 --> 00:56:08,907
Either one of you
could become my successor,

822
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:10,367
or it could be neither of you.

823
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:12,994
I know. That's your management philosophy.

824
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:15,664
Also,

825
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:17,999
live here with us
instead of staying at the hotel.

826
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:20,210
It's more comfortable there.

827
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,546
Won is all grown up now.

828
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:24,464
Let him do as he pleases.

829
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:27,801
I'm not going to repeat myself.

830
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:29,761
Come back home
before your mom's memorial service.

831
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:32,597
Which mom do you mean?

832
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:38,728
I don't even know

833
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:42,482
what my mom looks like
or if she's even alive or not.

834
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:54,869
Stop with the nonsense.

835
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:57,372
Just move in if I tell you to.

836
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:10,135
You take after your mom.

837
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:13,263
You're reckless just like her.

838
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:31,281
I'll be fine on my own. Go home.

839
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:41,499
Let me join you. The rain feels nice.

840
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:43,752
- Don't follow me.
- Whatever.

841
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:45,837
I know you don't have a friend
to drink with.

842
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:48,340
I like how you're smart-mouthed.

843
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:50,467
- True.
- And how you don't force a laugh.

844
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:51,843
I do though.

845
00:57:57,933 --> 00:58:00,060
What will the starting rank be by the way?

846
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,104
I don't know. It doesn't matter.

847
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:04,981
What do you mean?

848
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:06,358
I'm asking for myself.

849
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:08,234
You got the wrong idea.

850
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,153
I need some authority to protect you.

851
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:12,948
Who's going to deal
with your toxic personality? I will.

852
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:14,157
Let me be bold.

853
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:16,743
Department manager, please.

854
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,162
I went too far, didn't I?

855
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:20,080
Senior manager?

856
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:30,590
Take the car and go home.

857
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:33,677
I'll find my way to the hotel.
Don't follow me.

858
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:35,720
No, I'm going with you.

859
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:37,639
I should.

860
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,266
Gosh, the weather

861
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:43,228
is perfect for me to become a manager.

862
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:44,729
What kind of weather is that?

863
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:46,815
Please make me a manager.

864
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:48,483
- Let go.
- Please.

865
00:58:48,566 --> 00:58:50,443
My goodness!

866
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,153
- Please.
- Why is it raining so hard?

867
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:53,363
- I know, right?
- Darn it.

868
00:58:54,155 --> 00:58:55,949
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

869
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:03,665
That's refreshing.

870
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:05,417
This place has good beer.

871
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,627
Hey, this place
is very popular these days.

872
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:09,337
There's a line on the weekends.

873
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:12,298
What's wrong? Are you okay?

874
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:13,967
My stomach hurts for some reason.

875
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,051
Are you stressed?

876
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:17,053
This usually happens when you're stressed.

877
00:59:17,137 --> 00:59:19,431
It's obviously because of Gong Yu-nam.

878
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:20,974
Who's that?

879
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:23,935
Your boyfriend?

880
00:59:24,019 --> 00:59:26,813
Right. You have a boyfriend.

881
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:28,565
I totally forgot.

882
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:30,483
That's enough.

883
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,152
Isn't it about time you broke up with him?

884
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:33,695
I guess he didn't cross the line yet.

885
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:36,156
She's so lenient
when it comes to her boyfriend.

886
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,658
I'm more lenient with you guys.
Couldn't you tell?

887
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:42,328
Hey, holding a hot cup of tea

888
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:46,207
and saying, "It's hot,"
will only burn your hands.

889
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:48,835
Don't bottle everything up.
Get it off your chest.

890
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:53,131
Mom! Aunties!

891
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:59,596
If you drink here,
you'll destroy my reputation.

892
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:01,014
I worked so hard to build it.

893
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:02,599
All right, we'll stop drinking.

894
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:04,809
Go and play, my daughter.

895
01:00:09,898 --> 01:00:12,192
Your daughter is scarier than you.

896
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:15,361
I know, right? I'm too scared to drink.

897
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:19,783
I want to dance
under the lights all night long

898
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:22,327
holding a bottle of beer.

899
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:25,955
That sounds great, and it really was.

900
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:30,168
But I forgot how to dance, so I doubt
I'll have as much fun as I used to.

901
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:33,088
I don't even remember
what a nightclub looks like.

902
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:13,086
Gosh, my blood pressure.

903
01:01:39,571 --> 01:01:41,239
Do you need to wear a vest?

904
01:01:41,322 --> 01:01:42,574
It seems like a hassle.

905
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:46,661
This is how you should wear a suit.

906
01:01:46,744 --> 01:01:47,662
As expected,

907
01:01:47,745 --> 01:01:48,913
you have a classic style.

908
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:52,584
When are you going to fix this?

909
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:54,460
Should I get it fixed?

910
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:58,548
It's okay.

911
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:04,554
You look amazing today.

912
01:02:10,602 --> 01:02:12,145
It's finally our first day.

913
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:14,480
Let's start the day with a smile,
Head Manager Gu.

914
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:16,065
That's what I hate the most.

915
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:17,483
Faking, putting up a front…

916
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:18,401
Faking a smile.

917
01:02:19,319 --> 01:02:21,988
I was just saying
that you shouldn't feel too stressed

918
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:24,324
since all of this will be yours one day.

919
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:26,993
Maybe it's time for you to lose your job
seeing how you're bossing me around.

920
01:02:28,328 --> 01:02:29,996
No one else would stick around you.

921
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:32,123
You should be grateful to me.

922
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:34,167
You're consistently impudent.

923
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:35,335
True.

924
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:38,630
If it wasn't for my impudence,
I would've run away ages ago.

925
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:40,506
Who else would stay by your side?

926
01:02:44,052 --> 01:02:45,762
- My phone.
- You may head inside.

927
01:02:45,845 --> 01:02:47,680
I'll tell them to bring it.

928
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:54,187
Congratulations on your first day of work.

929
01:03:02,987 --> 01:03:03,905
The papers.

930
01:03:04,697 --> 01:03:05,573
Mr. No.

931
01:03:07,242 --> 01:03:08,243
Mr. No?

932
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:16,668
Yes.

933
01:03:17,377 --> 01:03:19,587
All right. We'll bring it
to you right away.

934
01:03:19,671 --> 01:03:22,257
Excuse me, Ms. Kim.
I need to use the restroom.

935
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:24,717
Head straight to the suite, find a phone,

936
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:26,219
and take it to Ms. Gu's office.

937
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:28,137
Wait, I'm sorry,

938
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:30,265
but I have a really bad stomachache.

939
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:31,849
To the point of crapping on the way?

940
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:34,560
- Yes.
- In that case,

941
01:03:35,395 --> 01:03:36,896
finish the errand quickly and then go.

942
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,357
But this is urgent.

943
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,484
Exactly. Hurry up and hop to it.

944
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:44,529
Yes, ma'am.

945
01:05:12,617 --> 01:05:13,785
My phone…

946
01:05:15,495 --> 01:05:16,788
I almost died.

947
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:20,875
What is this?

948
01:05:26,631 --> 01:05:28,549
The bathroom is bigger than my house.

949
01:05:28,633 --> 01:05:30,885
He only took my phone.

950
01:05:32,387 --> 01:05:33,596
This is so cool.

951
01:06:19,183 --> 01:06:22,186
KING THE LAND

952
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:57,180
{\an8}<i>Please welcome Head Manager Gu Won
with a big round of applause.</i>

953
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:01,225
{\an8}We…

954
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:03,102
{\an8}<i>meet again.</i>

955
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:05,438
{\an8}Welcome, Head Manager Gu!

956
01:07:06,939 --> 01:07:08,691
{\an8}We made eye contact again!

957
01:07:09,609 --> 01:07:11,944
{\an8}I warned you
to never let me see you again.

958
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:14,155
{\an8}I'll do my best to avoid you from now on.

959
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:17,450
{\an8}You said you'd do your best to avoid me.

960
01:07:18,576 --> 01:07:20,453
{\an8}<i>Even over my dead body,</i>

961
01:07:21,078 --> 01:07:23,414
{\an8}you are most definitely not my type.
