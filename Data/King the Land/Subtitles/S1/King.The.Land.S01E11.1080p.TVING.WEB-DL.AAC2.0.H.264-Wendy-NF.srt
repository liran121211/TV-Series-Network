1
00:00:48,589 --> 00:00:52,036
KING THE LAND

2
00:00:52,449 --> 00:00:54,062
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:54,143 --> 00:00:55,882
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

4
00:01:06,722 --> 00:01:09,558
I love you, Sa-rang.

5
00:01:12,103 --> 00:01:13,229
I love you too.

6
00:02:02,028 --> 00:02:03,904
{\an8}I don't want to go back to Korea.

7
00:02:03,988 --> 00:02:06,282
{\an8}I just want to stay here
for the rest of my life.

8
00:02:06,365 --> 00:02:08,117
{\an8}- I love Bangkok.
- Is it good?

9
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,618
{\an8}What about Cho-rong?

10
00:02:09,702 --> 00:02:11,579
{\an8}She's probably eagerly waiting for you.

11
00:02:11,662 --> 00:02:14,332
{\an8}You're right, I had a daughter.
I almost forgot.

12
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:17,835
{\an8}Cho-rong's mom, what's wrong with you?

13
00:02:17,918 --> 00:02:19,462
{\an8}Come to your senses.

14
00:02:19,545 --> 00:02:20,713
{\an8}Okay.

15
00:02:23,466 --> 00:02:25,760
{\an8}It is pretty sad to leave.

16
00:02:25,843 --> 00:02:27,136
{\an8}It all feels like a dream.

17
00:02:28,054 --> 00:02:29,597
We can always do this again.

18
00:02:30,556 --> 00:02:32,099
Somewhere even better next time.

19
00:02:33,017 --> 00:02:35,144
Don't forget what you just said.

20
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,898
Okay, I definitely won't, ma'am.

21
00:02:40,733 --> 00:02:44,487
What's the point of traveling together
when everyone just splits up?

22
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,572
Why did I even bother planning this trip,

23
00:02:46,655 --> 00:02:47,698
Mr. No?

24
00:02:47,782 --> 00:02:48,616
He's right.

25
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:50,868
You crossed the line and upset Mr. Yoo.

26
00:02:50,951 --> 00:02:52,119
You're the best.

27
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:57,166
So…

28
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:58,959
that is why

29
00:03:00,211 --> 00:03:02,004
I prepared a final present.

30
00:03:03,005 --> 00:03:03,839
What is it?

31
00:03:03,923 --> 00:03:05,049
It's a secret.

32
00:03:08,135 --> 00:03:09,595
That means there's nothing.

33
00:03:09,678 --> 00:03:10,596
You're right.

34
00:03:10,679 --> 00:03:12,264
Okay. Let's go.

35
00:03:16,727 --> 00:03:18,604
We go hard!

36
00:03:21,107 --> 00:03:22,817
- We go hard!
- We go hard!

37
00:03:24,652 --> 00:03:25,653
We are…

38
00:03:26,195 --> 00:03:27,530
- One!
- One!

39
00:03:34,787 --> 00:03:35,913
These are our seats?

40
00:03:37,081 --> 00:03:39,291
We all have business-class seats.
This is unreal.

41
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:40,626
Well of course.

42
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:42,253
King Group's VIP employees

43
00:03:42,336 --> 00:03:43,462
should sit in VIP seats.

44
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,756
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

45
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,174
Totally. I love it.

46
00:03:48,884 --> 00:03:49,718
Watch your head.

47
00:03:52,638 --> 00:03:55,433
I've always just served
the passengers who sit here.

48
00:03:55,516 --> 00:03:57,852
I never imagined
that I'd get to sit here myself.

49
00:03:57,935 --> 00:03:59,854
I know, right? What is all of this?

50
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:01,856
I have so much space.

51
00:04:02,398 --> 00:04:04,442
Mr. Yoo, thank you so much.

52
00:04:04,525 --> 00:04:06,360
We'll make sure to increase sales.

53
00:04:06,444 --> 00:04:08,946
Enjoy it to the fullest.
You all deserve it.

54
00:04:10,448 --> 00:04:11,490
You're the best!

55
00:04:11,574 --> 00:04:14,160
This trip was perfect
from start to finish.

56
00:04:15,077 --> 00:04:15,911
Thank you.

57
00:04:15,995 --> 00:04:17,872
I should be thanking you.

58
00:04:18,706 --> 00:04:19,874
I had fun thanks to you.

59
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,919
Am I allowed to be this happy?

60
00:04:24,503 --> 00:04:26,505
I'll make you even happier in the future.

61
00:04:45,566 --> 00:04:47,943
EPISODE 11

62
00:04:52,698 --> 00:04:56,494
The 100th-anniversary event is important
as it can only be held once a century.

63
00:04:56,577 --> 00:04:58,287
No mistakes are allowed.

64
00:04:58,954 --> 00:05:02,166
The banquet will consist of ten courses.

65
00:05:02,249 --> 00:05:04,126
We'll mainly be in charge of

66
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,879
greeting the important guests
and serving the VVIP tables.

67
00:05:07,421 --> 00:05:09,757
Since we'll be serving VVIPs,

68
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,593
let's provide the best service
under King the Land's name.

69
00:05:12,676 --> 00:05:14,678
- Okay. We'll do our best.
- Okay. We'll do our best.

70
00:05:14,762 --> 00:05:17,640
Once we receive the guest list,
can you check their information

71
00:05:17,723 --> 00:05:19,642
and make sure we don't miss anything

72
00:05:19,725 --> 00:05:21,227
that needs to be prepared, Ha-na?

73
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,020
Yes, I'll make sure to do that.

74
00:05:23,103 --> 00:05:24,522
I'll tell you if there are any changes.

75
00:05:24,605 --> 00:05:26,148
That's it for today's meeting.

76
00:05:27,149 --> 00:05:28,526
Also, Ms. Best Employee,

77
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,319
did you have a fun trip?

78
00:05:30,402 --> 00:05:32,738
Yes, I enjoyed my time thanks to you.

79
00:05:32,821 --> 00:05:34,823
They chose one employee per subsidiary.

80
00:05:35,407 --> 00:05:38,369
I'm glad the hotel's best employee
was someone from King the Land.

81
00:05:38,452 --> 00:05:39,286
I'm proud.

82
00:05:40,246 --> 00:05:42,373
Let's work hard
so that the next best employee

83
00:05:42,456 --> 00:05:43,874
gets chosen from King the Land.

84
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,125
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

85
00:05:46,252 --> 00:05:47,211
Ms. Jeon,

86
00:05:47,795 --> 00:05:49,672
this isn't much, but…

87
00:05:49,755 --> 00:05:51,715
- What is this?
- It's a bath bomb.

88
00:05:51,799 --> 00:05:54,218
I heard you take a bubble bath
every night after work.

89
00:05:54,301 --> 00:05:55,928
I picked one with a nice scent.

90
00:05:56,011 --> 00:05:59,139
It's so touching to hear
that you thought of me while traveling.

91
00:05:59,932 --> 00:06:01,225
Thank you. I'll use it well.

92
00:06:01,308 --> 00:06:02,393
All right.

93
00:06:03,936 --> 00:06:05,688
Look at her currying favor.

94
00:06:05,771 --> 00:06:07,648
She only brought something for Ms. Jeon.

95
00:06:07,731 --> 00:06:10,276
This is for you, Du-ri.

96
00:06:10,359 --> 00:06:11,652
This is yours, Se-ho.

97
00:06:11,735 --> 00:06:14,655
This is for you, Da-seok,

98
00:06:14,738 --> 00:06:16,407
and Ne-mo.

99
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,741
This is yours, Ha-na.

100
00:06:18,867 --> 00:06:21,537
You didn't have to buy stuff for us too.

101
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,746
It's really nothing much.

102
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,957
I just thought of you all while shopping.

103
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:27,668
Also, we're a team.

104
00:06:29,503 --> 00:06:31,005
Thank you. I'll use it well.

105
00:06:31,088 --> 00:06:33,007
- Thank you.
- Thanks so much for this.

106
00:06:36,844 --> 00:06:40,139
This is the hotel's plaque
prepared as a gift for the VIP guests

107
00:06:40,222 --> 00:06:42,308
who will be attending the event.

108
00:06:42,391 --> 00:06:44,518
WE APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT

109
00:06:44,601 --> 00:06:46,270
It looks better than I expected.

110
00:06:46,353 --> 00:06:47,313
Good work.

111
00:06:48,188 --> 00:06:50,524
I'm glad to hear that you like it.

112
00:06:51,108 --> 00:06:53,027
I planned and prepared it myself.

113
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,529
All right. But is this real gold?

114
00:06:56,989 --> 00:06:59,158
Yes. Following the limits
of the anti-graft law,

115
00:06:59,241 --> 00:07:01,827
I prepared 3 <i>don</i> of pure gold,
which is 11.25 g.

116
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,871
Let's prepare gifts for the employees too.

117
00:07:04,413 --> 00:07:06,081
- For every single one?
- Of course.

118
00:07:06,165 --> 00:07:08,417
Will the hotel be able to afford it?

119
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,003
If it's that burdensome,
we can take out your gift.

120
00:07:11,086 --> 00:07:13,339
It's not burdensome at all.

121
00:07:13,422 --> 00:07:14,923
I love your idea.

122
00:07:15,007 --> 00:07:16,550
If it's for everyone,

123
00:07:16,633 --> 00:07:19,511
I'd recommend
a hotel voucher or a buffet ticket.

124
00:07:21,096 --> 00:07:23,140
Let's put our convenience aside.

125
00:07:23,223 --> 00:07:26,060
Survey what the employees actually want,

126
00:07:26,143 --> 00:07:28,437
and prepare it that way.

127
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,647
Yes, sir.

128
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,106
I'll listen to their opinions

129
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,484
and prepare a gift
that will satisfy their wishes.

130
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:35,861
Good. Thank you.

131
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:50,417
Mr. Gu?

132
00:07:55,547 --> 00:07:56,715
Mr. Gu?

133
00:08:05,849 --> 00:08:06,934
- Mr. Gu!
- Yes?

134
00:08:10,145 --> 00:08:10,979
Hey.

135
00:08:11,063 --> 00:08:13,857
I called you multiple times,
but you wouldn't respond, sir.

136
00:08:13,941 --> 00:08:15,859
Sorry. I was a little busy with this.

137
00:08:17,778 --> 00:08:19,029
Then what do you think

138
00:08:19,113 --> 00:08:21,115
of working in your office?

139
00:08:21,198 --> 00:08:22,324
No, it's okay.

140
00:08:22,408 --> 00:08:24,451
You're probably busy.
You can go back to work.

141
00:08:27,204 --> 00:08:30,874
I'm asking you because
I can't work properly with you here.

142
00:08:31,542 --> 00:08:32,793
This is not an office.

143
00:08:32,876 --> 00:08:35,003
You shouldn't be acting like this here.

144
00:08:35,087 --> 00:08:36,463
Can't I work here a little?

145
00:08:37,297 --> 00:08:38,507
Of course not.

146
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,425
What?

147
00:08:41,009 --> 00:08:42,010
Who's the boss here?

148
00:08:42,094 --> 00:08:43,512
Get me the boss.

149
00:08:46,515 --> 00:08:47,850
I just want to see your face.

150
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:51,353
It's hard to make time
in the midst of all my work.

151
00:08:51,937 --> 00:08:55,065
It's nice to be in the same space as you,
even for a short while.

152
00:08:57,276 --> 00:08:58,110
Is it just me?

153
00:09:00,237 --> 00:09:01,196
No.

154
00:09:01,864 --> 00:09:02,990
I feel the same way.

155
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:07,745
Would you like something to drink, sir?

156
00:09:08,954 --> 00:09:11,165
I'll take anything, please.

157
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:17,087
Since you usually drink tea
rather than coffee in the afternoon,

158
00:09:17,171 --> 00:09:19,465
what do you think of Earl Grey tea?

159
00:09:20,215 --> 00:09:24,136
But how do you know so much about me?

160
00:09:24,219 --> 00:09:26,096
Are you interested in me?

161
00:09:26,764 --> 00:09:28,557
It's my job as a King the Land employee

162
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,309
to remember our guests' preferences.

163
00:09:30,392 --> 00:09:34,730
If that's the only reason,
then it's slightly upsetting.

164
00:09:35,355 --> 00:09:36,565
Look who's talking.

165
00:09:37,107 --> 00:09:39,276
You didn't even respond when I called you.

166
00:09:40,569 --> 00:09:42,070
You sure can hold a grudge.

167
00:09:42,696 --> 00:09:44,531
I'm pretty sure I already said sorry.

168
00:09:44,615 --> 00:09:47,493
You said you were upset,
so I just mentioned something as well.

169
00:09:47,576 --> 00:09:50,162
If you're that upset,
why don't we leave together later?

170
00:09:53,499 --> 00:09:55,709
How do we do that
with all these people watching?

171
00:09:55,793 --> 00:09:58,545
There are one, two, three,
four, five, six… Not that many.

172
00:09:58,629 --> 00:09:59,588
That's not a lot.

173
00:09:59,671 --> 00:10:01,131
Did we commit a crime?

174
00:10:01,215 --> 00:10:02,299
Is love a crime?

175
00:10:05,052 --> 00:10:07,805
I just don't want to be
the center of their gossip.

176
00:10:09,765 --> 00:10:11,391
We can leave separately,

177
00:10:11,475 --> 00:10:12,976
then meet up later.

178
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:18,899
Mr. Gu.

179
00:10:18,982 --> 00:10:20,275
I looked everywhere for you.

180
00:10:22,986 --> 00:10:24,363
Ms. Gu is looking for you.

181
00:10:24,446 --> 00:10:25,864
Rather urgently, if I may add.

182
00:10:28,742 --> 00:10:31,161
The guest list for the
100th-anniversary event isn't finalized.

183
00:10:31,245 --> 00:10:33,580
Yes, it is.
I just need to make a final decision.

184
00:10:33,664 --> 00:10:35,165
What's the difference?

185
00:10:35,249 --> 00:10:37,167
You don't have time to take it easy.

186
00:10:37,251 --> 00:10:39,711
Even the chairman's secretary's office
is asking for the guest list.

187
00:10:39,795 --> 00:10:42,673
I'm not taking it easy.
I'm just trying to be careful.

188
00:10:42,756 --> 00:10:44,466
Then carefully make a quick decision.

189
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,759
And take a look at this.

190
00:10:46,301 --> 00:10:48,554
This is the list of the VIPs
invited to major King Group events

191
00:10:48,637 --> 00:10:49,805
over the past five years.

192
00:10:49,888 --> 00:10:52,766
For your information,
Ms. Gu has mainly invited politicians

193
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,269
such as members of
the National Assembly and the LITC.

194
00:10:55,352 --> 00:10:56,186
So?

195
00:10:57,312 --> 00:10:58,313
We should do the same?

196
00:10:58,397 --> 00:10:59,231
No.

197
00:10:59,773 --> 00:11:02,317
As the people
who will be leading King Group,

198
00:11:02,401 --> 00:11:05,445
we should go with a young,
future-oriented, and global image.

199
00:11:05,946 --> 00:11:07,155
That's why I was thinking…

200
00:11:07,739 --> 00:11:09,741
Let's invite popular K-pop idols.

201
00:11:10,242 --> 00:11:12,828
I'll obviously be in charge
of inviting them.

202
00:11:13,787 --> 00:11:15,289
I told you to prepare for the event,

203
00:11:15,372 --> 00:11:16,957
not satisfy your own interests.

204
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,458
I'll take care of the rest.

205
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:20,460
You can just focus on the rehearsal.

206
00:11:21,211 --> 00:11:22,129
Got it?

207
00:11:24,756 --> 00:11:25,841
I'm counting on you.

208
00:11:31,263 --> 00:11:32,472
"I'm counting on you."

209
00:11:32,556 --> 00:11:33,599
You're cool.

210
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,892
Gosh. "I'm counting on you."

211
00:11:37,102 --> 00:11:38,687
Invite the people on that list.

212
00:11:39,271 --> 00:11:42,399
I asked Assemblyman Park
to give a congratulatory address,

213
00:11:42,482 --> 00:11:44,693
so arrange a section
after the chairman's speech.

214
00:11:45,944 --> 00:11:47,362
I'm in charge of the event.

215
00:11:47,446 --> 00:11:49,239
Just accept my help while it lasts.

216
00:11:49,323 --> 00:11:51,700
It's my responsibility,
so I'll do whatever I want.

217
00:11:52,618 --> 00:11:55,078
When you're in charge,
you can do whatever you want.

218
00:11:55,579 --> 00:11:57,664
You should know when to quit acting up.

219
00:11:57,748 --> 00:11:59,875
The 100th-anniversary event is not a joke.

220
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,628
We'll be presenting
who we'll be working with

221
00:12:02,711 --> 00:12:04,046
for the next 100 years.

222
00:12:04,129 --> 00:12:06,590
We need dignified people to be there.

223
00:12:11,178 --> 00:12:14,097
Politicians, high-ranking officials
from the Ministry of Finance…

224
00:12:15,057 --> 00:12:17,768
I guess you want to
create a future with these people.

225
00:12:17,851 --> 00:12:20,646
They are valuable people
for all of King Group's subsidiaries.

226
00:12:20,729 --> 00:12:23,273
I don't want to create anything
with these people.

227
00:12:23,774 --> 00:12:25,734
Success attained by mooching off
of those with power

228
00:12:25,817 --> 00:12:27,944
will crumble in front of power
no matter what.

229
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:29,655
You know that.

230
00:12:29,738 --> 00:12:31,698
Then what kind of future
will you make with whom?

231
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:44,461
There's a saying that the moment
you forget about the people

232
00:12:44,544 --> 00:12:47,047
who helped you along the way
is the moment of your fall.

233
00:12:48,924 --> 00:12:51,176
That means the next 100 years

234
00:12:51,259 --> 00:12:55,555
should be created with the people
who helped build up this hotel.

235
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:58,433
It must be fun playing the hero.

236
00:12:59,017 --> 00:13:01,478
You even gave the employees
business-class seats kept for executives

237
00:13:01,561 --> 00:13:03,730
and tried so hard to win their favor.

238
00:13:03,814 --> 00:13:05,649
Do you think you'll become something

239
00:13:06,525 --> 00:13:07,943
if you have them on your side?

240
00:13:08,026 --> 00:13:09,653
I wasn't trying to win their favor.

241
00:13:10,237 --> 00:13:11,321
I just did the obvious.

242
00:13:11,947 --> 00:13:13,657
Whether an executive or an employee,

243
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,701
anyone who works hard for the company

244
00:13:16,702 --> 00:13:18,245
will receive the same treatment.

245
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,664
- Who are you to do that?
- Me?

246
00:13:20,747 --> 00:13:21,957
Someone with a conscience.

247
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,334
At the very least,

248
00:13:24,418 --> 00:13:26,878
the company shouldn't be stabbing
its employees in the back.

249
00:13:27,504 --> 00:13:28,338
Don't you think?

250
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:35,929
Do you really think
all people are the same?

251
00:13:37,556 --> 00:13:40,892
Even though all balloons look the same,

252
00:13:40,976 --> 00:13:44,646
some float up and some fall down.

253
00:13:46,732 --> 00:13:48,233
What differentiates them

254
00:13:49,943 --> 00:13:51,069
is their blood.

255
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:54,448
They may look the same, but they're not.

256
00:13:55,782 --> 00:13:57,659
Because they have different genes.

257
00:13:59,536 --> 00:14:00,871
Just like you and me.

258
00:14:08,003 --> 00:14:09,796
How am I different?

259
00:14:17,596 --> 00:14:19,181
Just live without knowing.

260
00:14:22,267 --> 00:14:23,685
That's your fate.

261
00:14:29,886 --> 00:14:34,098
ALANGA SALES TARGET

262
00:14:37,727 --> 00:14:39,145
This is our new target.

263
00:14:39,729 --> 00:14:41,564
Calculate the sales on a daily basis

264
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:44,233
and give me a report
when you clock out every day.

265
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:47,278
The target amount is too high.

266
00:14:47,361 --> 00:14:49,030
So you can't do it?

267
00:14:50,448 --> 00:14:51,574
No, we can't.

268
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:55,745
Our original goal of a 10% increase
compared to last month is already so high.

269
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,205
All right.

270
00:14:57,288 --> 00:14:59,207
Then I'll report to headquarters

271
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,250
about a personnel reduction here.

272
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:04,170
Sorry? A personnel reduction?

273
00:15:04,253 --> 00:15:05,546
Sales may be increasing,

274
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,757
but so are the rent
and incidental expenses.

275
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,717
Alanga is in the red.

276
00:15:10,968 --> 00:15:12,553
With the current sales,

277
00:15:12,637 --> 00:15:14,555
we can't keep everyone.

278
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,933
So after this month…

279
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,643
MIN YU-BIN

280
00:15:18,726 --> 00:15:19,644
…fire the junior member.

281
00:15:21,437 --> 00:15:22,730
All of a sudden?

282
00:15:22,813 --> 00:15:26,275
That's why I gave you a solution.

283
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:29,195
But you rejected it.

284
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:30,613
Well, then.

285
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,032
Wait. I'll do it.

286
00:15:33,115 --> 00:15:35,159
We can do it.

287
00:15:35,743 --> 00:15:36,911
You should've said that earlier.

288
00:15:36,994 --> 00:15:39,163
How peaceful and nice is it now?

289
00:15:39,247 --> 00:15:40,790
I'm an advocate of peace.

290
00:15:47,421 --> 00:15:48,589
By the way,

291
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:53,094
you should treat the rest of us
to an expensive meal.

292
00:15:53,636 --> 00:15:54,470
Why?

293
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,305
It was thanks to me
that you went to Bangkok.

294
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:57,515
Did you forget?

295
00:15:58,474 --> 00:15:59,934
It wasn't thanks to you, Ms. Do.

296
00:16:00,017 --> 00:16:01,769
It was a result of my own efforts.

297
00:16:02,353 --> 00:16:04,397
Who gave you the motivation?

298
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,816
Thanks to me,
who encouraged you to work harder,

299
00:16:07,358 --> 00:16:10,444
you achieved record-high sales
and got chosen as the best employee.

300
00:16:13,114 --> 00:16:16,158
I heard omakase dining
is the trend these days.

301
00:16:17,326 --> 00:16:19,120
Make a reservation for next week.

302
00:16:19,203 --> 00:16:20,204
Then,

303
00:16:20,288 --> 00:16:21,914
I'll be leaving to work offsite.

304
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,419
It is a Mediterranean appetizer dish
made with natural oysters

305
00:17:08,502 --> 00:17:09,628
from the west coast.

306
00:17:10,212 --> 00:17:12,715
I used fennel to give it a fresh flavor.

307
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,634
It's fresh. It'd make a good appetizer.

308
00:17:16,594 --> 00:17:17,887
For the main course,

309
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:21,682
we prepared prime beef tenderloin
with a marbling score of nine

310
00:17:21,766 --> 00:17:23,893
from free-range, organic cows

311
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:25,770
from an animal welfare farm.

312
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:29,357
Great.

313
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,108
Overall, everything looks excellent.

314
00:17:31,692 --> 00:17:33,069
Thank you for your hard work.

315
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:34,570
Thank you, sir.

316
00:17:35,112 --> 00:17:37,740
Starting three months ago,
head chefs from each restaurant

317
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:40,117
have worked together
using the best ingredients.

318
00:17:40,201 --> 00:17:42,495
There will be some elderly guests.

319
00:17:42,578 --> 00:17:45,206
I'd like to add some dishes
that are easy to digest.

320
00:17:45,289 --> 00:17:49,293
Also, what do you think of preparing
a separate full-course meal

321
00:17:49,377 --> 00:17:51,337
for people who prefer Korean food,

322
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,381
so that they can choose?

323
00:17:54,131 --> 00:17:55,591
Understood.

324
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:57,426
I'll discuss it with the others
and have it prepared.

325
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,720
All right. Thank you.

326
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:05,017
I'll take the steak. Thank you.

327
00:18:11,065 --> 00:18:12,733
So you failed to get promoted again.

328
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:14,985
Mind your own business.

329
00:18:15,069 --> 00:18:18,823
What's the point of working your ass off?

330
00:18:18,906 --> 00:18:20,533
Learn from Mi-na.

331
00:18:20,616 --> 00:18:23,911
She buys presents for her boss
and even helps her family make kimchi.

332
00:18:23,994 --> 00:18:25,788
Who wouldn't adore her?

333
00:18:26,414 --> 00:18:28,207
Let's go for a consolation drink.

334
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,543
- No thanks.
- All right then.

335
00:18:30,626 --> 00:18:31,961
Suit yourself.

336
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:33,712
Ms. Yoo.

337
00:18:33,796 --> 00:18:34,713
Yes?

338
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,675
Why don't we go somewhere nice

339
00:18:37,758 --> 00:18:40,094
and have some drinks
to celebrate Mi-na's promotion?

340
00:18:41,095 --> 00:18:42,471
That sounds great.

341
00:18:42,972 --> 00:18:45,141
Then will it be on you?

342
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:47,476
I will pay for your drink, Ms. Yoo.

343
00:18:49,103 --> 00:18:51,313
Okay, let's go. You all heard him, right?

344
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:53,232
Yes, I'd love to go.

345
00:18:53,315 --> 00:18:55,484
I'm sorry,
but I don't think I can join you all.

346
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:56,569
What?

347
00:18:59,822 --> 00:19:03,117
Ro-un, we have to listen to
whatever the captain says.

348
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,493
I have plans.

349
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:07,663
All of us had plans as well.

350
00:19:08,831 --> 00:19:10,207
No, it's okay.

351
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,209
We can't make things mandatory these days.

352
00:19:12,835 --> 00:19:13,878
It's okay, right?

353
00:19:13,961 --> 00:19:15,671
Well of course.

354
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:17,465
Go ahead. Get out of here.

355
00:19:17,548 --> 00:19:19,758
I'm a flexible person, you know.

356
00:19:20,718 --> 00:19:22,011
You're the best, Mr. No.

357
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:24,388
All right. Then please excuse me.

358
00:19:28,309 --> 00:19:29,768
Let's go, Pyeong-hwa.

359
00:19:30,394 --> 00:19:31,228
What?

360
00:19:32,396 --> 00:19:34,106
What are you doing, Ro-un?

361
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,025
I had plans with Pyeong-hwa.

362
00:19:36,984 --> 00:19:38,611
Then we'll be leaving first.

363
00:19:39,528 --> 00:19:40,446
Let's go.

364
00:19:48,412 --> 00:19:50,873
I'll get going then.

365
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:52,583
I hope you have a fun time.

366
00:19:56,879 --> 00:19:59,840
Then I'll also leave if that's okay.

367
00:20:00,925 --> 00:20:03,594
I was pretty tired.
Thank you for your consideration.

368
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:12,853
I can't believe this.

369
00:20:17,107 --> 00:20:19,443
Did we have plans tonight?

370
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:21,320
Yes.

371
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:25,199
I was planning on coming here with you.

372
00:20:25,282 --> 00:20:27,368
Our time in Bangkok was too short.

373
00:20:28,577 --> 00:20:29,745
Isn't it nice here?

374
00:20:35,709 --> 00:20:38,462
If the captain says so,
we all have to attend no matter what.

375
00:20:38,546 --> 00:20:40,839
Aren't you even worried about tomorrow?

376
00:20:40,923 --> 00:20:43,842
Tomorrow will take care of itself.

377
00:20:44,426 --> 00:20:47,054
Today, I just like being here with you.

378
00:20:56,146 --> 00:20:58,274
By any chance…

379
00:21:00,651 --> 00:21:01,819
do you like me?

380
00:21:12,162 --> 00:21:13,205
Yes.

381
00:21:14,081 --> 00:21:15,124
I like you.

382
00:21:24,842 --> 00:21:25,968
I'm sorry,

383
00:21:27,678 --> 00:21:29,680
but I don't think
I can accept your feelings.

384
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:34,643
It's okay.

385
00:21:35,269 --> 00:21:38,105
I just answered your question
because you asked.

386
00:21:41,775 --> 00:21:43,861
You can do whatever you want.

387
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:47,281
I'll do what my heart tells me to do.

388
00:22:01,003 --> 00:22:03,672
You can go around this way
to go to the main building.

389
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:05,174
- Goodbye.
- All right. Thank you.

390
00:22:09,053 --> 00:22:10,512
- Sir.
- Mr. Gu.

391
00:22:11,722 --> 00:22:13,307
Do you have a few minutes?

392
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,850
I'm sorry,

393
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:17,102
but an important guest
will be arriving soon,

394
00:22:17,186 --> 00:22:18,771
so I can't leave.

395
00:22:19,688 --> 00:22:20,898
It won't take long.

396
00:22:20,981 --> 00:22:22,441
I'm sorry, Mr. Gu.

397
00:22:23,025 --> 00:22:25,736
I have to greet this guest myself.

398
00:22:27,321 --> 00:22:29,615
Then I'll be waiting at King the Land.

399
00:22:29,698 --> 00:22:32,159
- Yes, sir. I'll be with you shortly.
- Okay.

400
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:39,291
Welcome. I was waiting for you.

401
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:40,334
How have you been?

402
00:22:40,417 --> 00:22:43,003
I've been doing well thanks to you.

403
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:44,713
Right this way.

404
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:56,934
I'm sorry for making you wait.

405
00:22:57,017 --> 00:22:58,769
No, I'm the one
who made the sudden request.

406
00:22:58,852 --> 00:23:00,020
- Please sit.
- Okay.

407
00:23:01,355 --> 00:23:03,315
What would you like to drink?

408
00:23:03,399 --> 00:23:05,943
May I have a hot cup of tea?

409
00:23:06,026 --> 00:23:06,985
Yes, sir.

410
00:23:07,069 --> 00:23:08,695
I'll take the same thing.

411
00:23:08,779 --> 00:23:09,822
All right.

412
00:23:10,531 --> 00:23:12,950
You've been working here
for over seven years, right?

413
00:23:13,033 --> 00:23:15,828
Both then and now,
you have a pretty smile.

414
00:23:15,911 --> 00:23:18,080
How do you know how long I've worked here?

415
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:20,707
Because I'm the doorkeeper of this hotel.

416
00:23:22,042 --> 00:23:22,876
You're right.

417
00:23:23,877 --> 00:23:26,296
It's a pleasure to see you here, sir.

418
00:23:27,131 --> 00:23:28,882
I'll get the tea prepared right away.

419
00:23:33,095 --> 00:23:34,555
Who was the lady from earlier?

420
00:23:35,139 --> 00:23:38,267
She visits the hotel once a month
around this hour

421
00:23:38,892 --> 00:23:41,728
to eat a bowl of beef bone soup.

422
00:23:41,812 --> 00:23:45,107
She used to come with her husband.

423
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:48,444
After he passed, she still comes alone.

424
00:23:49,153 --> 00:23:52,239
I thought she would feel less lonely

425
00:23:52,322 --> 00:23:54,241
if I waited for her in his stead.

426
00:23:55,659 --> 00:23:59,997
The more I get to know the hotel staff,
the more I come to respect you all.

427
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,124
I think you're truly amazing.

428
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:03,250
No, I'm not.

429
00:24:04,001 --> 00:24:05,544
I do this because I enjoy it.

430
00:24:07,588 --> 00:24:11,008
I hear you have worked here
the longest among all the staff.

431
00:24:11,508 --> 00:24:13,802
You've stayed with us for a long time,

432
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:16,889
so I wanted to meet you
and have a conversation with you.

433
00:24:17,473 --> 00:24:20,017
I don't know if I'll be of any help.

434
00:24:23,103 --> 00:24:27,816
Is there a guest
that you remember the most?

435
00:24:30,903 --> 00:24:33,780
There is a large tree
by the main entrance of the hotel.

436
00:24:33,864 --> 00:24:38,076
It was donated by someone
who was a charter member.

437
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,538
He also helped the hotel a lot
when it was in crisis.

438
00:24:42,331 --> 00:24:43,999
After he passed away,

439
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:46,293
his son made frequent visits to the hotel,

440
00:24:46,376 --> 00:24:48,879
but I haven't seen him recently.

441
00:24:49,963 --> 00:24:53,133
If I get the chance,
I'd like to greet him as a guest again.

442
00:24:53,842 --> 00:24:55,260
So there was someone like that.

443
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:57,471
I had no idea.

444
00:24:58,722 --> 00:25:01,558
Was it always your dream
to work at a hotel?

445
00:25:01,642 --> 00:25:02,601
No.

446
00:25:03,894 --> 00:25:06,396
I just chased happiness

447
00:25:07,731 --> 00:25:08,690
and ended up here.

448
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:11,276
So…

449
00:25:13,195 --> 00:25:14,404
did you find happiness?

450
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:28,043
Thank you for your time.

451
00:25:30,587 --> 00:25:31,797
Take care.

452
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:39,304
Why did you bow so politely?

453
00:25:39,388 --> 00:25:41,056
- I was shocked.
- The rehearsal.

454
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,100
- Is everything ready?
- Yes, sir.

455
00:25:43,183 --> 00:25:44,184
Shall we?

456
00:26:09,543 --> 00:26:11,920
Keep the plates straight.

457
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:13,755
Don't let them tilt.

458
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:15,507
Check your entrance and exit routes

459
00:26:15,591 --> 00:26:17,593
so that the food can be served smoothly.

460
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:19,970
We must not exceed our allotted time.

461
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:21,555
They're so cool.

462
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,298
Are the rehearsals
usually performed to this extent?

463
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:58,091
All the banquets held at King Hotel

464
00:26:58,175 --> 00:27:00,344
are rehearsed the day before the event.

465
00:27:00,886 --> 00:27:04,306
Since this particular event
involves serving VVIP guests,

466
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:06,058
we are rehearsing in greater detail.

467
00:27:07,184 --> 00:27:08,810
Everyone is doing a lot more
than I expected.

468
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:10,979
Please keep it up until the end.

469
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:11,938
Yes, sir.

470
00:27:12,022 --> 00:27:14,608
We will serve each guest
with our utmost sincerity.

471
00:27:14,691 --> 00:27:15,692
Thank you.

472
00:27:37,881 --> 00:27:39,800
Wait! Hold on.

473
00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:42,969
- It's me.
- You scared me.

474
00:27:43,053 --> 00:27:44,346
Are you okay?

475
00:27:44,971 --> 00:27:46,682
- Do I look okay?
- My goodness.

476
00:27:48,058 --> 00:27:49,559
How are you so strong?

477
00:27:50,227 --> 00:27:51,395
My stomach.

478
00:27:51,478 --> 00:27:53,647
Why did you suddenly hug me from behind?

479
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:54,940
You startled me.

480
00:27:55,023 --> 00:27:56,608
I was trying to surprise you.

481
00:27:56,692 --> 00:27:59,361
Though I didn't know
you'd be so excited to see me.

482
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:02,280
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

483
00:28:02,364 --> 00:28:05,075
I won't have to worry about you
walking alone at night.

484
00:28:06,702 --> 00:28:08,412
Did you take boxing lessons as a kid?

485
00:28:12,666 --> 00:28:14,209
This sound isn't coming from my mouth.

486
00:28:15,377 --> 00:28:16,920
It's coming from my punches.

487
00:28:18,505 --> 00:28:19,589
Are you having fun?

488
00:28:20,424 --> 00:28:23,593
I never lost to anyone
ever since I was little.

489
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:25,470
I bet.

490
00:28:29,182 --> 00:28:30,475
Is it that painful?

491
00:28:31,935 --> 00:28:33,103
Oh no.

492
00:28:33,186 --> 00:28:34,396
Are you okay?

493
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,567
Goodness.

494
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:40,694
Oh no.

495
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:43,280
It hurts.

496
00:28:43,363 --> 00:28:45,282
Do you need to go to the hospital?

497
00:28:45,365 --> 00:28:46,366
Should we go?

498
00:28:47,701 --> 00:28:48,744
It hurts.

499
00:28:49,453 --> 00:28:50,537
This feels nice.

500
00:28:57,836 --> 00:28:59,129
You can't do this here.

501
00:28:59,963 --> 00:29:01,673
I need to recharge.

502
00:29:02,299 --> 00:29:03,842
Today was so exhausting.

503
00:29:03,925 --> 00:29:05,177
I'm running out of energy.

504
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:12,059
Can you plug in a charger here?

505
00:29:14,311 --> 00:29:16,396
I need to recharge.

506
00:29:22,444 --> 00:29:23,445
There.

507
00:29:24,404 --> 00:29:26,698
I'm afraid someone might see us.

508
00:29:27,407 --> 00:29:28,492
I'm at 1% now.

509
00:29:29,451 --> 00:29:30,786
Just 1%?

510
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:32,496
Yes, please charge me.

511
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,460
Please.

512
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:39,878
I'm at 5%. Now 10%.

513
00:29:39,961 --> 00:29:41,880
That's far from enough.

514
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:45,550
Charge, please.

515
00:29:48,261 --> 00:29:50,013
I'm at 15, 25, 30%.

516
00:29:55,185 --> 00:29:57,229
100%. I'm fully charged.

517
00:29:57,312 --> 00:29:59,022
Gosh, you're so silly.

518
00:30:04,986 --> 00:30:05,821
Oh my god.

519
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:07,531
- Oh my goodness.
- What?

520
00:30:07,614 --> 00:30:10,367
- Hide.
- Why?

521
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:11,910
What's wrong with you?

522
00:30:11,993 --> 00:30:12,994
Oh no.

523
00:30:13,078 --> 00:30:15,247
They're King Hotel employees.

524
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:16,248
- Get up.
- But where?

525
00:30:16,331 --> 00:30:18,208
- Hold on. Where?
- The bus.

526
00:30:18,291 --> 00:30:19,501
- The bus.
- Hurry.

527
00:30:21,211 --> 00:30:23,296
- That gave me a fright.
- You're employees, yes?

528
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,673
"Employees"?

529
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:27,509
Hello, Mr. Gu!

530
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:31,096
- Hello, Mr. Gu!
- Hello, Mr. Gu!

531
00:30:31,179 --> 00:30:34,057
- Hello, Mr. Gu!
- Hello, Mr. Gu!

532
00:30:34,141 --> 00:30:35,767
- Hello, Mr. Gu!
- Hello, Mr. Gu!

533
00:30:37,727 --> 00:30:39,146
Hello, Mr. Gu.

534
00:30:39,729 --> 00:30:41,106
KING HOTEL SHUTTLE BUS

535
00:30:49,197 --> 00:30:50,031
Mr. Gu,

536
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:54,703
this is the shuttle bus that helps
King Hotel employees commute

537
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:56,121
to and from work.

538
00:30:57,289 --> 00:30:59,791
The hotel has three shifts,

539
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:03,461
so the bus operates
six different times throughout the day.

540
00:31:03,545 --> 00:31:06,464
We enjoy a lot of employee perks,

541
00:31:06,548 --> 00:31:08,633
but I believe this shuttle bus

542
00:31:08,717 --> 00:31:11,261
is what the employees need most.

543
00:31:12,554 --> 00:31:14,055
Thank you very much.

544
00:31:14,723 --> 00:31:16,224
Thank you!

545
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:18,810
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

546
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,355
- Thank you!
- Say goodbye now.

547
00:31:22,439 --> 00:31:24,816
Smile and wave goodbye.

548
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,318
I'm very thankful as well.

549
00:31:26,401 --> 00:31:29,029
- Please keep up the good work.
- We love you!

550
00:31:29,112 --> 00:31:30,155
Okay.

551
00:31:30,238 --> 00:31:31,198
Get home safely.

552
00:31:31,281 --> 00:31:33,033
Mr. Gu will now get off.

553
00:31:33,116 --> 00:31:34,659
Get home safely.

554
00:31:34,743 --> 00:31:36,036
Goodbye.

555
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:37,412
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

556
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:39,080
Mr. Gu, you're the best!

557
00:31:39,164 --> 00:31:40,457
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

558
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,541
You're the best!

559
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:58,683
- That was so funny.
- Jeez.

560
00:31:58,767 --> 00:32:01,436
We went out of the frying pan
into the fryer.

561
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,022
How did you come up with that on the spot?

562
00:32:04,105 --> 00:32:06,191
My mind went completely blank.

563
00:32:06,274 --> 00:32:07,234
I don't know either.

564
00:32:07,734 --> 00:32:09,069
I had to ride it out somehow.

565
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:11,780
No secrets are forever.

566
00:32:12,906 --> 00:32:14,324
We should still be careful.

567
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:17,994
Why?

568
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:20,664
Because I'm the chairman's son?

569
00:32:20,747 --> 00:32:22,165
If I were worried about that,

570
00:32:22,249 --> 00:32:23,917
I wouldn't have dated you
in the first place.

571
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:27,963
But how did you find this place?

572
00:32:28,964 --> 00:32:30,048
Well,

573
00:32:30,966 --> 00:32:33,843
you seemed to like the moon in Bangkok,
so I ran a search.

574
00:32:35,136 --> 00:32:38,139
Apparently, this river has the most moons.

575
00:32:41,268 --> 00:32:42,227
It's beautiful.

576
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:44,396
Is it?

577
00:32:45,355 --> 00:32:46,856
Should we go down and walk?

578
00:32:52,988 --> 00:32:54,030
By the way,

579
00:32:55,699 --> 00:32:57,534
why did you meet the doorman earlier?

580
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:00,287
It was for the event.

581
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:02,664
I heard he was with the hotel the longest,

582
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:04,082
so I wanted to talk to him.

583
00:33:04,165 --> 00:33:06,751
I heard he worked here for over 30 years.

584
00:33:06,835 --> 00:33:09,170
He's living proof of King Hotel's history.

585
00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:11,131
Yes, that's what I heard too.

586
00:33:14,968 --> 00:33:15,969
By any chance…

587
00:33:19,889 --> 00:33:20,932
did you ask him?

588
00:33:21,975 --> 00:33:22,892
About what?

589
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:26,271
About your mom.

590
00:33:27,188 --> 00:33:28,690
I'm sure he'd know.

591
00:33:30,859 --> 00:33:31,776
Why bother?

592
00:33:33,361 --> 00:33:34,279
"Why bother?"

593
00:33:34,362 --> 00:33:36,031
There's no point in asking him.

594
00:33:36,823 --> 00:33:38,950
The answer is obvious.

595
00:33:39,034 --> 00:33:40,618
Where's my mom?

596
00:33:40,702 --> 00:33:43,455
She wasn't here yesterday,
and she's not here today.

597
00:33:43,538 --> 00:33:45,248
Please get up.

598
00:33:45,749 --> 00:33:47,125
The chairman is waiting.

599
00:33:47,751 --> 00:33:49,336
<i>Whenever I asked something,</i>

600
00:33:49,878 --> 00:33:53,173
<i>everyone kept their mouth shut
and hid the truth from me even more.</i>

601
00:33:53,757 --> 00:33:56,217
It felt as if the traces
that I'd just barely found

602
00:33:56,301 --> 00:33:57,510
were all being erased.

603
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:02,015
But still,

604
00:34:02,098 --> 00:34:04,225
he could be the one to tell you.

605
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:06,644
It's okay.

606
00:34:08,313 --> 00:34:10,690
It was a matter
that I had to solve on my own anyway.

607
00:34:10,774 --> 00:34:11,733
Also,

608
00:34:13,234 --> 00:34:14,444
I decided

609
00:34:15,236 --> 00:34:16,780
to put an end to my quest.

610
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:44,849
You're home.

611
00:34:44,933 --> 00:34:46,184
Hurry up and sit.

612
00:34:46,267 --> 00:34:47,727
What's all this?

613
00:34:53,233 --> 00:34:54,317
All right.

614
00:34:59,739 --> 00:35:00,990
It's good.

615
00:35:05,578 --> 00:35:07,038
The sauce tastes just right.

616
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:09,082
Hey Sa-rang,

617
00:35:09,165 --> 00:35:10,166
did Mr. No

618
00:35:10,792 --> 00:35:11,626
do it yet?

619
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:15,755
- Do what?
- What do you think?

620
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:16,714
Ask you out.

621
00:35:19,759 --> 00:35:21,511
No, we don't like each other.

622
00:35:21,594 --> 00:35:24,013
Why not? What's wrong with Mr. No?

623
00:35:24,097 --> 00:35:26,599
I'd say he's a pretty decent man.

624
00:35:26,683 --> 00:35:28,560
It's nothing like that.

625
00:35:28,643 --> 00:35:30,603
If not, why did you two
run away in Thailand

626
00:35:30,687 --> 00:35:31,771
and make Mr. Yoo upset?

627
00:35:32,605 --> 00:35:34,983
I think I need to wash up first.

628
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:36,276
You guys go ahead.

629
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:39,279
Gosh, it's so hot.
I can't eat because it's so hot.

630
00:35:40,113 --> 00:35:41,865
Why does she feel hot all of a sudden?

631
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:51,207
So I'm suggesting that we co-host

632
00:35:51,291 --> 00:35:54,043
the 100th-anniversary event
as staff representatives.

633
00:35:55,503 --> 00:35:56,880
I thought you didn't like me.

634
00:35:56,963 --> 00:35:59,799
That's correct.
But I have to put personal feelings aside.

635
00:36:00,383 --> 00:36:02,719
You did a great job
during the inaugural ceremony.

636
00:36:04,179 --> 00:36:05,638
It's only natural for me

637
00:36:05,722 --> 00:36:08,683
to host the big event
as a staff representative,

638
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:10,393
but not with you.

639
00:36:10,477 --> 00:36:11,811
I'm out of your league.

640
00:36:13,438 --> 00:36:14,898
What a shame.

641
00:36:14,981 --> 00:36:17,233
It would be nice if you were kind-hearted.

642
00:36:17,317 --> 00:36:20,320
Why do you care
whether I'm kind-hearted or not?

643
00:36:20,403 --> 00:36:22,780
I just think it's a pity.

644
00:36:22,864 --> 00:36:24,240
You're exceptionally beautiful

645
00:36:24,324 --> 00:36:26,534
and competent enough
to have become the youngest manager.

646
00:36:26,618 --> 00:36:31,164
I just don't understand why you would
keep making a mockery of yourself.

647
00:36:32,248 --> 00:36:34,334
- Is that an insult or a compliment?
- An insult.

648
00:36:36,419 --> 00:36:39,631
Well, I'm not too keen on your offer,

649
00:36:39,714 --> 00:36:42,425
but since you're begging me,
I'll lend you a helping hand

650
00:36:42,509 --> 00:36:44,385
as King Hotel's most competent employee.

651
00:36:46,012 --> 00:36:48,306
Yes, please help me.

652
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:58,024
I hope we get along.

653
00:37:17,252 --> 00:37:18,503
I must be insane.

654
00:37:18,586 --> 00:37:20,255
Why would I fall for a guy like him?

655
00:37:49,492 --> 00:37:50,493
Why are you…

656
00:37:55,498 --> 00:37:56,666
Does it hurt a lot?

657
00:37:56,749 --> 00:37:58,626
Well of course it does.

658
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,086
You hit me with steel.

659
00:38:00,169 --> 00:38:01,170
Goodness.

660
00:38:01,254 --> 00:38:05,800
You shouldn't have snuck in
like a thief without telling me.

661
00:38:07,176 --> 00:38:08,052
I just…

662
00:38:09,137 --> 00:38:10,847
I came to give you these gifts.

663
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:13,850
And last time,
I noticed the water pressure was low,

664
00:38:14,601 --> 00:38:17,478
so I was trying to fix the sink
while I was waiting.

665
00:38:17,562 --> 00:38:19,314
Then you should've told me.

666
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,900
You didn't give me a chance to.

667
00:38:24,152 --> 00:38:25,028
Hold on.

668
00:38:25,111 --> 00:38:26,070
Come to think of it,

669
00:38:26,863 --> 00:38:30,033
you and your granddaughter are so similar.

670
00:38:30,116 --> 00:38:32,285
Your fist moves before your mouth.

671
00:38:32,368 --> 00:38:33,953
Of course. She's my baby.

672
00:38:35,204 --> 00:38:36,914
Do you know why she's so pretty?

673
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:40,335
It's because she takes after me.

674
00:38:41,294 --> 00:38:43,338
But what is all of that?

675
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:44,339
These?

676
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:48,092
You know how Sa-rang went to Thailand
after being chosen as the best employee?

677
00:38:48,968 --> 00:38:53,222
Thailand is known for its silk.

678
00:38:53,306 --> 00:38:55,224
And this was made from its finest.

679
00:38:57,185 --> 00:38:59,395
I don't have anywhere to wear this.

680
00:39:00,021 --> 00:39:02,649
Why did you spend your money
on something like this?

681
00:39:02,732 --> 00:39:03,691
Do you have money to burn?

682
00:39:03,775 --> 00:39:07,153
From now on, you can travel a lot.

683
00:39:08,237 --> 00:39:10,448
I'll take you to many places.

684
00:39:12,992 --> 00:39:14,160
Let's see.

685
00:39:19,207 --> 00:39:21,417
If you'll excuse me.

686
00:39:26,255 --> 00:39:28,132
What do you think? Isn't it pretty?

687
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:31,511
- Oh, I don't know…
- Here.

688
00:39:31,594 --> 00:39:35,014
Yes, it is pretty.

689
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:39,477
Well, I guess I do look good
no matter what I wear.

690
00:39:40,937 --> 00:39:43,231
It's thanks to my good fashion sense.

691
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:45,191
Hold on a second.

692
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:54,867
This is a magical cream
that smooths out all the wrinkles

693
00:39:54,951 --> 00:39:56,327
on your face.

694
00:39:56,411 --> 00:39:57,578
And…

695
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:00,540
this is called Tiger Balm.

696
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:03,835
It's good for any aches or pains.

697
00:40:03,918 --> 00:40:05,795
It also soothes headaches.

698
00:40:05,878 --> 00:40:07,088
What?

699
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:09,340
Then is it a cure-all?

700
00:40:09,424 --> 00:40:11,426
Yes, it's the best remedy for the elderly.

701
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:12,427
I see.

702
00:40:13,386 --> 00:40:15,972
How much did you buy?

703
00:40:16,055 --> 00:40:18,099
You could run a store with all of that.

704
00:40:18,766 --> 00:40:19,684
Goodness.

705
00:40:19,767 --> 00:40:22,061
You can share these
with your market friends.

706
00:40:22,145 --> 00:40:23,229
I…

707
00:40:24,313 --> 00:40:25,898
just bought a little.

708
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:29,152
I can't believe
you thought of my friends too.

709
00:40:29,694 --> 00:40:30,778
How sweet of you.

710
00:40:31,487 --> 00:40:36,409
Last time, your friends gave me
vegetable juice and yogurt drinks.

711
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:41,205
Hey,

712
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:44,417
just be a good son to your father.

713
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:47,295
Did you buy a gift for your father?

714
00:40:52,675 --> 00:40:53,509
No.

715
00:40:53,593 --> 00:40:54,510
Good grief.

716
00:40:55,261 --> 00:40:57,513
What's the point of having kids?

717
00:40:57,597 --> 00:40:58,473
Jeez.

718
00:40:58,556 --> 00:40:59,932
Give this to your father.

719
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:08,316
All right.

720
00:41:09,817 --> 00:41:10,860
Did you eat?

721
00:41:13,738 --> 00:41:14,572
Not yet.

722
00:41:15,156 --> 00:41:16,574
- Ms. Cha.
- Yes?

723
00:41:16,657 --> 00:41:17,658
Here's the ginseng chicken soup.

724
00:41:17,742 --> 00:41:19,118
Goodness. Just in time.

725
00:41:23,164 --> 00:41:24,582
Sa-rang told me

726
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:30,713
that you raised her all by yourself
ever since she was little.

727
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:33,674
I didn't do much.

728
00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:35,384
She grew well on her own.

729
00:41:37,762 --> 00:41:42,266
She never once threw a tantrum
even though she lived apart from her mom.

730
00:41:43,059 --> 00:41:44,477
She kept everything bottled up,

731
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,938
and when she acted
like a baby for the first time,

732
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:50,691
saying she wanted to live with her,
her mom got into an accident.

733
00:41:53,778 --> 00:41:55,404
I think that's why

734
00:41:55,488 --> 00:41:59,116
she's never asked me
to do anything for her.

735
00:42:02,161 --> 00:42:03,579
From now on,

736
00:42:03,663 --> 00:42:06,666
I'll stay by her side
and let her throw tantrums

737
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:09,502
and act like a baby.

738
00:42:11,087 --> 00:42:15,341
You can always rely on me
to protect both you and Sa-rang.

739
00:42:15,424 --> 00:42:17,051
I'm okay.

740
00:42:17,927 --> 00:42:20,680
Just treat Sa-rang well, okay?

741
00:42:21,681 --> 00:42:23,307
I'll treat you both well.

742
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,726
Thank you

743
00:42:26,352 --> 00:42:29,313
for raising Sa-rang
to be such a beautiful person.

744
00:42:32,942 --> 00:42:35,570
Here. I cooked it for a while
to make it tender.

745
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:37,321
- Try it.
- Thank you.

746
00:42:37,405 --> 00:42:39,198
Let's see how it tastes.

747
00:42:39,282 --> 00:42:40,825
- Here.
- Yes.

748
00:42:40,908 --> 00:42:41,993
- Take it.
- Thank you.

749
00:42:42,076 --> 00:42:43,494
Sure. Eat up.

750
00:42:43,578 --> 00:42:44,704
Thank you.

751
00:43:12,481 --> 00:43:13,524
Sir.

752
00:43:14,567 --> 00:43:15,401
Hello.

753
00:43:16,277 --> 00:43:17,904
I know this is sudden,

754
00:43:18,821 --> 00:43:20,698
but may I ask you something?

755
00:43:20,781 --> 00:43:22,658
Yes, go ahead.

756
00:43:24,827 --> 00:43:25,828
I was wondering

757
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:29,040
if you knew someone
who used to work here long ago.

758
00:43:29,999 --> 00:43:33,502
Do you know a person
by the name of Han Mi-so?

759
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:36,255
I do.

760
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:42,094
Then do you know her contact information
or where she may be right now?

761
00:43:43,512 --> 00:43:45,848
I know who she is,

762
00:43:45,932 --> 00:43:47,350
but that's about it.

763
00:43:50,311 --> 00:43:51,312
I see.

764
00:43:51,896 --> 00:43:53,648
Thank you for your time.

765
00:43:55,066 --> 00:43:57,818
But I have a friend

766
00:43:58,694 --> 00:44:01,822
who might remember more than I do.

767
00:44:18,673 --> 00:44:19,840
Hello.

768
00:44:19,924 --> 00:44:24,804
May I ask if you're Ms. Kim Ok-ja,
the room inspector?

769
00:44:25,346 --> 00:44:26,222
What are you doing?

770
00:44:26,305 --> 00:44:28,140
How dare you step into the room

771
00:44:28,224 --> 00:44:29,558
with your shoes on?

772
00:44:30,643 --> 00:44:31,727
Get out.

773
00:44:33,938 --> 00:44:34,772
I'm sorry.

774
00:44:34,855 --> 00:44:37,692
Hotel rooms are products
prepared for the guests.

775
00:44:38,484 --> 00:44:40,653
How dare a concierge
step on a guest's product?

776
00:44:40,736 --> 00:44:42,154
You don't know the basics.

777
00:44:43,072 --> 00:44:44,115
I'm sorry.

778
00:44:44,865 --> 00:44:46,242
I wanted to ask you something.

779
00:44:46,325 --> 00:44:49,662
Whatever it is, I don't want to talk
to someone who lacks common sense.

780
00:44:49,745 --> 00:44:50,705
Goodbye.

781
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,670
I apologize for the discourtesy.

782
00:44:57,753 --> 00:45:00,506
I'll visit you again at another time.

783
00:45:35,291 --> 00:45:37,168
Are you going to leave Won be?

784
00:45:38,043 --> 00:45:40,546
He finally set his mind to something.

785
00:45:41,255 --> 00:45:42,256
I should let him.

786
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:43,591
It's an important event.

787
00:45:45,176 --> 00:45:47,511
When you first launched Alanga,

788
00:45:47,595 --> 00:45:49,472
all the executives were against it.

789
00:45:50,431 --> 00:45:52,683
But do you know why I let you?

790
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:54,935
I was giving you a chance.

791
00:45:55,936 --> 00:45:58,773
Won should also be given
a chance for it to be fair.

792
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:01,150
Alanga's success was guaranteed.

793
00:46:02,026 --> 00:46:04,862
What Won is doing
will obviously lead to failure.

794
00:46:04,945 --> 00:46:05,988
If he fails,

795
00:46:06,614 --> 00:46:08,532
I'll hold him responsible then.

796
00:46:09,325 --> 00:46:10,910
Now is not the time to intervene.

797
00:46:18,626 --> 00:46:20,169
Won acts

798
00:46:21,462 --> 00:46:23,380
so much like his mom.

799
00:46:24,089 --> 00:46:25,174
Don't you agree?

800
00:46:28,427 --> 00:46:32,139
I'm worried about how much you'll suffer
if you have to abandon him

801
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:34,934
just like you abandoned his mom.

802
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,650
You're all grown up.

803
00:46:43,692 --> 00:46:45,361
You're even worrying about me now.

804
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:34,618
You're home.

805
00:47:35,411 --> 00:47:36,412
Yes.

806
00:47:37,037 --> 00:47:38,289
Get some rest.

807
00:47:55,389 --> 00:47:56,223
What is it?

808
00:47:56,807 --> 00:47:57,766
Do you have something to say?

809
00:47:58,726 --> 00:47:59,727
No.

810
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:03,522
Are my opinions not important

811
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:05,858
in planning for the big event?

812
00:48:16,035 --> 00:48:17,995
There was something I wanted to ask.

813
00:48:20,623 --> 00:48:21,874
And what is that?

814
00:48:22,791 --> 00:48:24,293
Is the King Hotel of today

815
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:29,048
the hotel that you wanted it to be?

816
00:48:33,928 --> 00:48:35,763
It was my dream

817
00:48:37,264 --> 00:48:39,099
for everyone who came to King Hotel

818
00:48:39,767 --> 00:48:41,852
to be happy.

819
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:46,649
Everyone including the guests
and the employees.

820
00:48:50,194 --> 00:48:51,320
However,

821
00:48:52,571 --> 00:48:54,448
a dream is just a dream.

822
00:48:57,993 --> 00:48:59,745
Did you ever try to make it come true?

823
00:49:02,289 --> 00:49:05,668
My employees' lives
and the lives of their families

824
00:49:06,585 --> 00:49:08,504
depend on my decisions.

825
00:49:10,381 --> 00:49:12,299
I believe the hotel has lasted 100 years

826
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:15,844
because I never made
any reckless attempts.

827
00:49:18,764 --> 00:49:19,932
I have no regrets.

828
00:49:20,599 --> 00:49:24,269
I was able to protect King Hotel
in exchange for my dream,

829
00:49:24,353 --> 00:49:27,356
and I also built King Air
and King Distribution.

830
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:31,485
That's good to hear.

831
00:49:32,236 --> 00:49:33,237
I…

832
00:49:34,488 --> 00:49:37,241
was worried that you never had a dream.

833
00:49:46,166 --> 00:49:48,210
I know what it is that you want to do.

834
00:49:49,294 --> 00:49:50,546
I know what you desire too.

835
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:52,381
But

836
00:49:53,132 --> 00:49:54,174
don't do it.

837
00:49:55,384 --> 00:49:57,553
I'm being serious. This is a warning.

838
00:49:58,262 --> 00:49:59,263
Do you understand?

839
00:49:59,847 --> 00:50:00,889
- Father--
- If it's hard,

840
00:50:00,973 --> 00:50:02,641
ask your sister for help.

841
00:50:04,059 --> 00:50:05,936
Asking for help is a skill.

842
00:50:11,275 --> 00:50:12,693
It's Tiger Balm.

843
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:14,903
Apply it to alleviate any type of pain.

844
00:51:11,627 --> 00:51:13,087
Today is finally here.

845
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:16,006
It's going to be the best party ever,

846
00:51:16,090 --> 00:51:17,007
so don't be nervous.

847
00:51:17,091 --> 00:51:18,133
There's no need to be.

848
00:51:18,217 --> 00:51:20,302
We've done well so far,

849
00:51:20,385 --> 00:51:22,221
and everything will continue to go well.

850
00:51:22,304 --> 00:51:23,305
No need to be nervous.

851
00:51:23,889 --> 00:51:25,933
We've rehearsed enough.

852
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:28,560
It's going to be the best party
without a hitch.

853
00:51:28,644 --> 00:51:29,478
So don't worry.

854
00:51:29,561 --> 00:51:31,814
You can just count on me.

855
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:35,734
Why are you trembling?

856
00:51:35,818 --> 00:51:36,819
Me?

857
00:51:37,569 --> 00:51:39,238
What are you talking about?

858
00:51:39,321 --> 00:51:40,864
I'm not the type to get nervous.

859
00:51:40,948 --> 00:51:42,116
You know that.

860
00:51:42,741 --> 00:51:44,034
I wasn't trembling.

861
00:51:45,828 --> 00:51:46,870
I don't think so.

862
00:51:47,454 --> 00:51:48,580
You're so nervous.

863
00:51:48,664 --> 00:51:50,582
No, I'm not.

864
00:51:50,666 --> 00:51:51,667
Why are you sweating?

865
00:51:52,251 --> 00:51:53,418
I'm sweating?

866
00:51:56,588 --> 00:51:57,422
Don't be nervous.

867
00:51:58,715 --> 00:51:59,925
- It's a party.
- Yes.

868
00:52:03,011 --> 00:52:04,888
- Have fun.
- Okay.

869
00:52:05,722 --> 00:52:06,640
Drink some water.

870
00:52:06,723 --> 00:52:08,350
- And breathe.
- Yes, sir.

871
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:12,646
You're super nervous.

872
00:52:12,729 --> 00:52:13,772
Good luck!

WORDS OF WELCOME AND ENCOURAGEMENT
HEAD MANAGER GU WON

876
00:53:00,502 --> 00:53:01,420
Goodness.

877
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:03,380
Thank you.

878
00:53:07,217 --> 00:53:09,469
I thought we were doing
something important.

879
00:53:09,553 --> 00:53:11,888
- This is it?
- What do you mean?

880
00:53:11,972 --> 00:53:14,766
We're greeting the guests
of our hotel's 100th birthday party.

881
00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:16,268
This is the most important role.

882
00:53:22,274 --> 00:53:24,901
Something like this
may be important to you,

883
00:53:24,985 --> 00:53:26,361
but it isn't for me.

884
00:53:26,445 --> 00:53:29,573
The host is the first person
to greet the guests.

885
00:53:29,656 --> 00:53:31,450
At least for today,

886
00:53:31,533 --> 00:53:34,036
we are the hosts of this party.

887
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:39,624
Just wipe your sweat.

888
00:53:39,708 --> 00:53:41,835
You acted so cool,
but you're a nervous wreck.

889
00:53:41,918 --> 00:53:43,795
I don't get nervous. Where's the sweat?

890
00:53:43,879 --> 00:53:45,172
Oh, there it is.

891
00:53:52,471 --> 00:53:53,430
Do you like me?

Happy 100th anniversary to King Hotel.

896
00:55:12,259 --> 00:55:13,510
Hello,

897
00:55:13,593 --> 00:55:15,637
I am King Hotel's head manager, Gu Won.

898
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:19,766
I would like to sincerely thank
all of the honored guests

899
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:22,686
for attending King Hotel's
100th-anniversary event.

900
00:55:23,186 --> 00:55:24,271
In addition,

901
00:55:25,605 --> 00:55:28,108
I'd like to express
my bottomless gratitude

902
00:55:28,191 --> 00:55:30,902
to all the employees
who are working diligently

903
00:55:30,986 --> 00:55:34,406
<i>behind the scenes even now</i>

904
00:55:35,157 --> 00:55:37,909
<i>in order to make this event shine.</i>

905
00:55:39,995 --> 00:55:40,996
<i>Then,</i>

906
00:55:41,621 --> 00:55:43,623
<i>we will start the ceremony</i>

907
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:45,625
with Chairman Gu Il-hun's
congratulatory address.

908
00:56:00,724 --> 00:56:01,725
Hello,

909
00:56:02,225 --> 00:56:03,894
I am Gu Il-hun.

910
00:56:03,977 --> 00:56:06,354
In preparation
for my congratulatory address,

911
00:56:06,938 --> 00:56:08,482
I contacted a speech expert.

912
00:56:09,357 --> 00:56:12,027
I told the expert that I wanted to deliver

913
00:56:12,110 --> 00:56:15,197
a historic speech
for the hotel's 100th-anniversary event,

914
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,033
and I sought an expert's advice.

915
00:56:18,116 --> 00:56:21,286
I was given an unequivocal answer.

916
00:56:23,288 --> 00:56:24,831
"Just make it short."

917
00:56:33,715 --> 00:56:35,509
What? Did someone arrive?

918
00:56:36,218 --> 00:56:37,385
I wonder what's so funny.

919
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:40,222
We never get to watch the event.

920
00:56:40,305 --> 00:56:42,140
We're always just running around.

921
00:56:42,724 --> 00:56:45,268
But this time,
I feel like we're the stars of the event.

922
00:56:45,352 --> 00:56:48,772
It feels like I'm serving guests
for a party at my house.

923
00:56:48,855 --> 00:56:49,773
You're right.

924
00:56:49,856 --> 00:56:52,067
This only happens once every 100 years.

925
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:55,028
Let's finish strong
on behalf of King the Land.

926
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:56,321
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

927
00:56:56,404 --> 00:56:58,406
Sa-rang, you're up next, right?

928
00:56:58,490 --> 00:57:00,951
Yes. I'll be right back.

929
00:57:01,034 --> 00:57:02,285
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

930
00:57:15,382 --> 00:57:17,551
I hope the past 100 years

931
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:21,972
will be able to shape
the next 100 years of the hotel.

932
00:57:22,764 --> 00:57:23,807
Also,

933
00:57:24,558 --> 00:57:28,144
for the 200th-anniversary event,

934
00:57:28,228 --> 00:57:31,940
I will try to prepare
an even shorter message.

935
00:57:32,023 --> 00:57:33,024
Thank you.

936
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:46,204
- I liked your speech.
- Thanks.

937
00:57:46,788 --> 00:57:47,706
Thank you.

938
00:57:53,128 --> 00:57:56,131
Next up, we have a special guest

939
00:57:56,214 --> 00:57:58,341
who will deliver a congratulatory address.

940
00:57:58,425 --> 00:57:59,593
It's your turn, Mr. Park.

941
00:57:59,676 --> 00:58:01,803
- You'll do great.
- Of course.

942
00:58:02,596 --> 00:58:04,347
It was not easy to invite this person.

943
00:58:05,265 --> 00:58:09,227
I would like to thank you
on behalf of the hotel's executives.

944
00:58:10,061 --> 00:58:13,607
Mr. Choi Yeong-su,
could you please come forward?

945
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:31,958
What is this?

946
00:58:37,923 --> 00:58:39,341
Thank you for coming.

947
00:58:39,424 --> 00:58:41,718
I hope I'm not disrupting the event.

948
00:58:41,801 --> 00:58:43,345
You're the guest of honor.

949
00:58:43,428 --> 00:58:44,429
Please.

950
00:58:55,231 --> 00:58:56,066
Hello,

951
00:58:56,650 --> 00:58:58,443
my name is Choi Yeong-su.

952
00:58:59,402 --> 00:59:03,031
I own a small pizza shop in Daejeon.

953
00:59:04,157 --> 00:59:05,367
To be honest,

954
00:59:05,450 --> 00:59:09,537
I'm not exactly sure
why I was invited to this event.

955
00:59:09,621 --> 00:59:11,581
I think it may be

956
00:59:12,207 --> 00:59:13,959
because of my father.

957
00:59:15,001 --> 00:59:18,838
My father was a charter member
of King Hotel's membership club.

958
00:59:19,547 --> 00:59:21,883
I believe my father was the one

959
00:59:21,967 --> 00:59:24,302
who planted the tree
in front of the hotel.

960
00:59:24,970 --> 00:59:28,264
When I was little,
I came here a lot with my father.

961
00:59:29,099 --> 00:59:32,268
To me, King Hotel was the best playground.

962
00:59:33,019 --> 00:59:37,482
I remember the CEO of the hotel
being very loving.

963
00:59:38,233 --> 00:59:41,403
But once my father's business
started to decline,

964
00:59:41,486 --> 00:59:43,697
I never got to come back here.

965
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,992
Since I've been busy making ends meet,

966
00:59:47,075 --> 00:59:49,828
I noticed that I've started to lose hope

967
00:59:49,911 --> 00:59:52,122
and that I give up more easily.

968
00:59:52,956 --> 00:59:53,957
However,

969
00:59:55,125 --> 00:59:58,420
coming back here makes me dream.

970
00:59:59,212 --> 01:00:00,714
Next Christmas,

971
01:00:00,797 --> 01:00:03,633
I plan on visiting King Hotel
with my family.

972
01:00:04,342 --> 01:00:08,013
Until then, I'm going to work really hard.

973
01:00:10,098 --> 01:00:12,559
Also, I would like to sincerely thank

974
01:00:12,642 --> 01:00:15,061
Head Manager Gu Won
for coming all the way to Daejeon

975
01:00:15,145 --> 01:00:18,273
to invite a nobody like me to this event.

976
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:19,649
And…

977
01:00:20,608 --> 01:00:22,861
How should I end this?

978
01:00:22,944 --> 01:00:23,820
Well…

979
01:00:24,487 --> 01:00:26,740
May King Hotel prosper!

980
01:00:34,039 --> 01:00:35,123
Thank you.

981
01:00:36,124 --> 01:00:38,668
- You may go this way.
- Hey, so you're Yeong-su.

982
01:00:39,419 --> 01:00:42,630
Right? Mr. Choi Jang-su's eldest son.

983
01:00:42,714 --> 01:00:44,090
Do you remember me?

984
01:00:44,174 --> 01:00:46,092
How could I forget you?

985
01:00:46,176 --> 01:00:49,345
I received so much help from your father.
I owe him a lot.

986
01:00:50,889 --> 01:00:53,349
I'm sorry that I was unaware.

987
01:00:53,892 --> 01:00:54,893
You're always welcome.

988
01:00:55,477 --> 01:00:58,521
The rooms and restaurants
will always be reserved for you.

989
01:00:58,605 --> 01:01:01,107
Make sure you come with your family. Okay?

990
01:01:02,692 --> 01:01:03,902
Have a seat.

991
01:01:06,529 --> 01:01:07,947
He's Choi Jang-su's son.

992
01:01:08,031 --> 01:01:09,157
Can you believe it?

993
01:01:10,784 --> 01:01:11,868
It is said

994
01:01:12,535 --> 01:01:15,663
that flowers don't forget
about the person who watered them.

995
01:01:16,831 --> 01:01:18,666
While planning for this event,

996
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:20,752
I continued to keep that saying in mind.

997
01:01:21,836 --> 01:01:25,715
The people who helped create
the first 100 years of King Hotel

998
01:01:25,799 --> 01:01:29,844
and the people who will be creating
the next 100 years are all here together.

999
01:01:31,429 --> 01:01:35,433
I would now like to introduce you all
to the VIP of VIPs.

1000
01:01:35,975 --> 01:01:37,644
I'm sorry for the confusion.

1001
01:01:37,727 --> 01:01:39,229
I look forward to your speech.

1002
01:01:41,147 --> 01:01:43,358
The deep-rooted tree of King Hotel.

1003
01:01:43,441 --> 01:01:46,694
I now introduce you to Mr. Kim Bong-sik.

1004
01:02:12,053 --> 01:02:13,513
Hello.

1005
01:02:13,596 --> 01:02:14,806
I am

1006
01:02:16,141 --> 01:02:18,434
King Hotel's doorman, Kim Bong-sik.

1007
01:02:24,315 --> 01:02:26,526
You were a salesman
for a pharmaceutical company?

1008
01:02:27,235 --> 01:02:28,278
That's right.

1009
01:02:28,945 --> 01:02:32,240
I usually treated my clients
at King Hotel's bar.

1010
01:02:32,323 --> 01:02:34,659
At times, I would have to drink
three times a day

1011
01:02:35,326 --> 01:02:37,787
during lunch, dinner,
and even late at night.

1012
01:02:39,038 --> 01:02:40,790
But one day,

1013
01:02:41,541 --> 01:02:42,834
I got so drunk

1014
01:02:42,917 --> 01:02:46,921
that I fell asleep
on a sofa in the hotel lobby,

1015
01:02:47,005 --> 01:02:48,673
and when I woke up in the morning,

1016
01:02:48,756 --> 01:02:49,799
I witnessed

1017
01:02:50,717 --> 01:02:52,343
a completely different world.

1018
01:02:53,136 --> 01:02:57,473
All of the employees were working
with smiles on their faces.

1019
01:02:59,392 --> 01:03:04,439
It made me wonder
why everyone looked so happy.

1020
01:03:04,522 --> 01:03:07,025
That's when I started to dream.

1021
01:03:08,193 --> 01:03:10,153
I thought I would be able to live

1022
01:03:10,236 --> 01:03:12,780
with a smile on my face if I worked here.

1023
01:03:13,573 --> 01:03:16,784
So I started working here.

1024
01:03:19,245 --> 01:03:24,542
Do you think you could repeat
what you just said during our event?

1025
01:03:24,626 --> 01:03:26,127
What event, sir?

1026
01:03:26,211 --> 01:03:27,962
The 100th-anniversary event.

1027
01:03:28,963 --> 01:03:30,048
That's absurd.

1028
01:03:30,131 --> 01:03:32,050
That's not a place for me.

1029
01:03:33,384 --> 01:03:34,344
Please, sir.

1030
01:03:35,178 --> 01:03:36,346
Why are you doing this?

1031
01:03:36,429 --> 01:03:38,389
You're the doorkeeper of our hotel.

1032
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:43,144
You looked after King Hotel for 30 years.

1033
01:03:43,728 --> 01:03:46,648
Please grace the occasion
with your presence.

1034
01:03:47,774 --> 01:03:49,275
Are you being serious?

1035
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:51,027
Please share your dream

1036
01:03:52,237 --> 01:03:54,781
with me as well.

1037
01:03:55,949 --> 01:03:57,700
Coming to King Hotel,

1038
01:03:58,701 --> 01:04:00,328
I achieved my dream.

1039
01:04:01,621 --> 01:04:05,250
Most of my time at work
is spent outside of the hotel,

1040
01:04:06,417 --> 01:04:11,464
but I am the proud doorkeeper
of King Hotel,

1041
01:04:12,507 --> 01:04:14,717
Kim Bong-sik.

1042
01:04:22,016 --> 01:04:24,477
HOTEL LOWER LEVEL 1

1043
01:04:28,856 --> 01:04:29,857
Hello.

1044
01:04:37,907 --> 01:04:41,577
Are those the lights that were used
in our hotel 20 years ago?

1045
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:44,372
Yes, that's right.

1046
01:04:44,455 --> 01:04:46,499
They're the first lights that I replaced

1047
01:04:46,582 --> 01:04:48,334
after I started working here.

1048
01:04:48,418 --> 01:04:52,422
But what brings you here, Mr. Gu?

1049
01:04:54,549 --> 01:04:56,384
I came here to ask you for a favor.

1050
01:04:59,804 --> 01:05:01,723
I've only been cutting meat for ten years.

1051
01:05:01,806 --> 01:05:02,682
A VIP?

1052
01:05:02,765 --> 01:05:05,476
Please. How am I a VIP?

1053
01:05:06,561 --> 01:05:08,563
People don't even know

1054
01:05:08,646 --> 01:05:10,898
there's a butcher like me
who works in the hotel.

1055
01:05:13,109 --> 01:05:14,902
That's why I want to show them.

1056
01:05:15,862 --> 01:05:17,905
That there are people
who work for the hotel

1057
01:05:18,865 --> 01:05:21,117
even though they've never worn a uniform.

1058
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:23,244
I appreciate your intentions,
but I'm worried.

1059
01:05:23,953 --> 01:05:26,581
I have a low rank,
but I've worked at the hotel for longer,

1060
01:05:26,664 --> 01:05:27,915
so I'll be upfront.

1061
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,044
Do you know what
the best kind of hotel is?

1062
01:05:33,504 --> 01:05:34,714
What?

1063
01:05:41,971 --> 01:05:45,516
A hotel where people like me
don't run into the guests.

1064
01:05:47,352 --> 01:05:51,064
That is why we always try our best
to avoid the guests.

1065
01:05:53,441 --> 01:05:56,486
But you're asking me
to stand on the podium?

1066
01:05:57,987 --> 01:06:01,366
If you put a spotlight on people like us,

1067
01:06:01,449 --> 01:06:02,909
you'll be criticized, Mr. Gu.

1068
01:06:04,535 --> 01:06:06,788
Do you know what I consider
to be the best hotel?

1069
01:06:07,372 --> 01:06:10,124
One that's profitable?

1070
01:06:10,708 --> 01:06:11,959
That's right.

1071
01:06:12,043 --> 01:06:13,586
The best hotel

1072
01:06:13,669 --> 01:06:15,963
is a highly profitable one
with high sales figures.

1073
01:06:16,547 --> 01:06:19,967
That is why people like you
are the most valuable.

1074
01:06:21,135 --> 01:06:24,806
It is you who are on the front lines
who make the best hotel.

1075
01:06:25,765 --> 01:06:28,017
If I had been planning on
using you for the event,

1076
01:06:28,101 --> 01:06:29,977
I would've just ordered HR to do this.

1077
01:06:30,061 --> 01:06:33,940
But you all are the most important guests,
so I came here myself.

1078
01:06:35,441 --> 01:06:37,360
It's King Hotel's 100th-anniversary event.

1079
01:06:37,443 --> 01:06:40,822
I don't want it to be held
without the guests of honor.

1080
01:06:51,416 --> 01:06:54,961
I have been working
in the room inspection team for 27 years,

1081
01:06:55,044 --> 01:06:57,797
and my name is Kim Ok-ja.

1082
01:07:17,150 --> 01:07:18,651
<i>Although I don't meet the guests…</i>

1083
01:07:18,734 --> 01:07:19,569
Mr. Park.

1084
01:07:21,654 --> 01:07:22,655
Ms. Gu.

1085
01:07:22,738 --> 01:07:24,323
You made a big mistake today.

1086
01:07:25,908 --> 01:07:27,034
You'll pay for this.

1087
01:07:27,118 --> 01:07:29,245
<i>…so that the guests may feel welcomed.</i>

1088
01:07:29,871 --> 01:07:34,250
<i>That is how I've been shaping
King Hotel from my position.</i>

1089
01:07:43,092 --> 01:07:44,594
Your speech was incredible.

1090
01:07:45,219 --> 01:07:47,680
It is an honor
to be able to serve my seniors.

1091
01:07:48,181 --> 01:07:49,056
Thank you.

1092
01:07:50,475 --> 01:07:53,060
I'm sorry about the other day.

1093
01:07:53,144 --> 01:07:54,228
I learned a lot.

1094
01:07:55,146 --> 01:07:56,147
Don't be.

1095
01:07:56,856 --> 01:08:00,401
I didn't consider the fact
that you don't work in the rooms.

1096
01:08:01,027 --> 01:08:03,738
I wanted to apologize
for getting so worked up.

1097
01:08:03,821 --> 01:08:04,655
Not at all.

1098
01:08:04,739 --> 01:08:06,199
Come again next time.

1099
01:08:06,282 --> 01:08:08,242
I promise I'll be more calm.

1100
01:08:09,494 --> 01:08:11,162
Okay. Thank you.

1101
01:08:11,245 --> 01:08:12,538
I'll make sure to stop by.

1102
01:08:13,998 --> 01:08:15,333
That's my son.

1103
01:08:41,025 --> 01:08:43,027
PROPOSAL FOR KING HOTEL'S
MISSION AND BUSINESS GOALS

1104
01:08:43,110 --> 01:08:45,947
STRATEGIC PLANNING TEAM, HAN MI-SO

1105
01:08:46,030 --> 01:08:47,782
"A hotel where everyone is happy"?

1106
01:08:48,533 --> 01:08:50,326
Do you really think that's possible?

1107
01:08:50,409 --> 01:08:52,620
You're more than capable
of making such a hotel.

1108
01:08:53,496 --> 01:08:55,039
I'll help you by your side.

1109
01:09:15,726 --> 01:09:16,561
Father.

1110
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:22,066
What are you doing?

1111
01:09:22,858 --> 01:09:25,403
Are you reminiscing
when the event's been ruined?

1112
01:09:26,237 --> 01:09:27,572
Let's talk later.

1113
01:09:28,364 --> 01:09:30,324
Won and his sentimentality

1114
01:09:30,408 --> 01:09:33,369
cost us the most essential figure
for our group, Assemblyman Park.

1115
01:09:33,452 --> 01:09:36,455
The duty-free license expires next year,
so it needs to be renewed.

1116
01:09:36,539 --> 01:09:38,583
We also need to expand air routes.

1117
01:09:38,666 --> 01:09:40,585
- Aren't you aware?
- That's right.

1118
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:43,170
There were so many things to do

1119
01:09:43,838 --> 01:09:45,756
that I lost sight of what was valuable.

1120
01:09:46,924 --> 01:09:49,218
Don't make me distrust you too.

1121
01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:51,387
King Group

1122
01:09:52,722 --> 01:09:54,265
is not yours alone.

1123
01:10:12,617 --> 01:10:14,660
- Enjoy your time.
- Sure.

1124
01:10:14,744 --> 01:10:15,828
Thank you.

1125
01:10:23,002 --> 01:10:24,211
Congratulations.

1126
01:10:24,295 --> 01:10:25,838
You were amazing today.

1127
01:10:27,131 --> 01:10:28,507
I'm always amazing.

1128
01:10:31,636 --> 01:10:33,054
Do you want to

1129
01:10:33,846 --> 01:10:35,181
come to my house this Sunday?

1130
01:10:37,433 --> 01:10:39,435
Pyeong-hwa won't be home
because of a flight.

1131
01:10:45,608 --> 01:10:46,901
Yes, I do.

1132
01:10:47,568 --> 01:10:49,570
I'll be there no matter what.

1133
01:11:12,343 --> 01:11:15,304
Make it delicious.

1134
01:11:48,838 --> 01:11:50,673
Thank you for inviting me.

1135
01:11:51,298 --> 01:11:52,258
Welcome.

1136
01:11:54,301 --> 01:11:55,511
They're so beautiful.

1137
01:11:58,013 --> 01:11:59,849
You made all of this yourself?

1138
01:12:00,558 --> 01:12:03,728
It's not a lot,
but I prepared it with care and love.

1139
01:12:03,811 --> 01:12:06,355
"It's not a lot"? This is a feast.

1140
01:12:06,439 --> 01:12:07,356
I just

1141
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:09,400
wanted to make you a home-cooked meal.

1142
01:12:11,819 --> 01:12:12,778
Thank you.

1143
01:12:14,488 --> 01:12:15,448
MR. NO

1144
01:12:20,453 --> 01:12:21,537
Aren't you going to pick up?

1145
01:12:21,620 --> 01:12:23,247
No, I don't want to be interrupted.

1146
01:12:24,457 --> 01:12:26,292
I wonder what will taste the best.

1147
01:12:26,375 --> 01:12:28,210
- I know everything will taste good.
- Yes.

1148
01:12:28,294 --> 01:12:29,795
But I'll have the rolled omelet.

1149
01:12:36,135 --> 01:12:37,553
How does it taste? Is it okay?

1150
01:12:39,847 --> 01:12:41,182
It's not just okay.

1151
01:12:41,807 --> 01:12:42,641
It's remarkable.

1152
01:12:42,725 --> 01:12:44,643
You could be the sous-chef of our hotel.

1153
01:12:45,269 --> 01:12:47,313
Well if you hire me, I'd be happy to.

1154
01:12:50,024 --> 01:12:51,609
- Try this too.
- Okay.

1155
01:12:59,074 --> 01:13:00,618
This is so touching, babe.

1156
01:13:03,078 --> 01:13:04,079
"Babe"?

1157
01:13:05,748 --> 01:13:07,124
You should try it too, babe.

1158
01:13:10,127 --> 01:13:11,128
Here.

1159
01:13:13,798 --> 01:13:14,882
How is it?

1160
01:13:17,009 --> 01:13:18,344
It's so good, babe.

1161
01:13:18,427 --> 01:13:20,262
- You think it's good too, babe?
- Yes.

1162
01:13:24,391 --> 01:13:25,434
Thank you.

1163
01:13:27,353 --> 01:13:29,939
I don't know if I deserve to receive

1164
01:13:30,648 --> 01:13:32,274
such a marvelous dinner.

1165
01:13:32,358 --> 01:13:34,109
I'll cook for you again next time.

1166
01:13:35,319 --> 01:13:36,403
I'd love that.

1167
01:13:41,617 --> 01:13:42,618
This is nice.

1168
01:13:44,078 --> 01:13:45,120
It is.

1169
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:48,040
The music is so nice too.

1170
01:14:02,972 --> 01:14:04,974
- I drank it all.
- Me too.

1171
01:14:05,057 --> 01:14:06,684
- I'll bring more.
- No, I'll do it.

1172
01:14:06,767 --> 01:14:07,935
This is my place. Let me.

1173
01:14:08,018 --> 01:14:09,728
- You made me food. Let me.
- No.

1174
01:14:10,312 --> 01:14:11,438
I'll do it.

1175
01:14:11,522 --> 01:14:12,731
- Me.
- Just stay still.

1176
01:14:12,815 --> 01:14:14,108
- I want to do it.
- Let me.

1177
01:14:14,191 --> 01:14:15,192
- No, I will.
- I will.

1178
01:14:15,276 --> 01:14:16,569
I will.

1179
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:18,237
- I'll go.
- Then let's go together.

1180
01:14:18,779 --> 01:14:19,655
Wait.

1181
01:14:20,489 --> 01:14:22,324
Okay. Shall we go together?

1182
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:24,201
Sure.

1183
01:14:35,045 --> 01:14:36,755
Are you going to drink more beer?

1184
01:14:38,883 --> 01:14:39,967
What if I say no?

1185
01:15:39,777 --> 01:15:42,780
KING THE LAND

1186
01:16:14,895 --> 01:16:16,230
{\an8}<i>I want to go somewhere.</i>

1187
01:16:16,313 --> 01:16:17,231
{\an8}<i>Let's go.</i>

1188
01:16:17,314 --> 01:16:18,649
{\an8}<i>You won't ask where it is?</i>

1189
01:16:18,732 --> 01:16:21,610
{\an8}Bring me reports on what you'll do
for the future of King Group.

1190
01:16:21,694 --> 01:16:22,528
{\an8}<i>Both of you.</i>

1191
01:16:22,611 --> 01:16:24,446
{\an8}<i>The war has finally begun.</i>

1192
01:16:24,530 --> 01:16:25,823
{\an8}<i>You only have me.</i>

1193
01:16:25,906 --> 01:16:29,785
{\an8}<i>Make sure you report
everything related to Mr. Gu to me.</i>

1194
01:16:30,369 --> 01:16:34,540
{\an8}In that case,
how high can I go by helping you?

1195
01:16:34,623 --> 01:16:37,042
{\an8}<i>How come your employees aren't trained?</i>

1196
01:16:38,043 --> 01:16:40,546
{\an8}<i>I can't leave you alone
if you're this endearing.</i>

1197
01:16:40,629 --> 01:16:41,714
{\an8}It's your fault.
