KING THE LAND

00:00:52,449 --> 00:00:54,062
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:54,143 --> 00:00:55,882
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

00:00:56,286 --> 00:00:57,162
PERSONNEL RECORDS

5
00:00:57,246 --> 00:00:59,206
Is that everything from 1989?

6
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,291
Yes.

7
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:04,044
Who are you looking for if I may ask?

8
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:07,881
I don't know why you came to work here,

9
00:01:07,965 --> 00:01:09,758
but you'll have to fight me for life.

10
00:01:09,842 --> 00:01:11,719
I'm telling you for your sake.

11
00:01:11,802 --> 00:01:13,887
Don't end up like your mom.

12
00:01:16,056 --> 00:01:16,974
Never mind.

13
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,191
- Hello.
- Hello.

14
00:01:45,335 --> 00:01:47,129
Please come downstairs and eat.

15
00:01:48,088 --> 00:01:49,423
Where's my mom?

16
00:01:50,174 --> 00:01:52,843
She wasn't here yesterday,
and she's not here today.

17
00:01:53,469 --> 00:01:55,304
Please get up.

18
00:01:55,387 --> 00:01:56,889
The chairman is waiting.

19
00:02:00,517 --> 00:02:01,560
Come along.

20
00:02:19,203 --> 00:02:20,371
Hello.

21
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:23,540
Hello.

22
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:26,335
Hello.

23
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:28,295
Hello.

24
00:02:36,595 --> 00:02:37,763
Don't smile.

25
00:02:40,057 --> 00:02:41,600
Stop smiling.

26
00:02:47,314 --> 00:02:49,608
Don't smile!

27
00:02:50,109 --> 00:02:52,027
I said stop smiling!

28
00:03:25,561 --> 00:03:26,687
<i>Don't smile.</i>

29
00:03:30,899 --> 00:03:32,067
<i>Stop smiling.</i>

30
00:05:09,164 --> 00:05:10,541
This is my spot.

31
00:05:11,917 --> 00:05:12,876
Excuse me?

32
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:16,630
This is

33
00:05:18,173 --> 00:05:19,466
my spot.

34
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,091
So you know how to cry?

35
00:06:11,226 --> 00:06:12,769
I'll allow it for a moment.

36
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:15,981
Stay still.

37
00:06:40,714 --> 00:06:41,715
Let's go.

38
00:06:43,342 --> 00:06:44,718
I'll take you home.

39
00:06:51,683 --> 00:06:53,602
It's okay. I can go on my own.

40
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:16,958
Get in.

41
00:07:35,894 --> 00:07:36,937
Where's your umbrella?

42
00:07:38,313 --> 00:07:39,564
It flew away.

43
00:07:43,902 --> 00:07:45,195
You should've held on to it.

44
00:07:48,949 --> 00:07:50,534
I didn't want to.

45
00:07:52,828 --> 00:07:55,497
It was carried far away by the wind…

46
00:07:59,626 --> 00:08:01,670
and for some reason,
it made me feel at ease.

47
00:08:04,715 --> 00:08:07,551
Maybe I should've let go a lot earlier.

48
00:08:10,262 --> 00:08:11,888
Is this about your umbrella?

49
00:08:15,976 --> 00:08:17,352
Or is it about your love life?

50
00:08:24,609 --> 00:08:26,987
You can drop me off anywhere
near a subway station.

51
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:28,066
EPISODE 5

52
00:10:41,997 --> 00:10:42,956
Hey.

53
00:10:47,043 --> 00:10:48,753
- Phony Cheon.
- Yes, sir.

54
00:10:52,591 --> 00:10:53,550
What?

55
00:10:55,051 --> 00:10:56,177
Where are we?

56
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,389
Here.

57
00:11:01,683 --> 00:11:02,601
What is this?

58
00:11:02,684 --> 00:11:03,852
It probably won't fit.

59
00:11:03,935 --> 00:11:05,562
Just wear it today and throw it out later.

60
00:11:05,645 --> 00:11:06,771
Wait, sir.

61
00:11:08,773 --> 00:11:09,816
Let's eat.

62
00:11:10,775 --> 00:11:12,110
It's your birthday.

63
00:12:01,326 --> 00:12:02,369
What the…

64
00:12:03,078 --> 00:12:04,537
Your outfit…

65
00:12:05,413 --> 00:12:06,373
Wait.

66
00:12:15,427 --> 00:12:17,429
People will think we're a couple.

67
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:19,347
No one will think that.

68
00:12:19,431 --> 00:12:21,141
I could do so much better.

69
00:12:21,767 --> 00:12:23,769
All right. Please look over here.

70
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:28,023
You two look so good together.

71
00:12:28,106 --> 00:12:29,775
Do you want another picture?

72
00:12:29,858 --> 00:12:31,526
No, we're not together.

73
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:32,736
I'm sorry.

74
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:35,572
I thought you were
because you looked so good together.

75
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:38,241
- Then what should I do with…
- You can just leave it here.

76
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:39,326
Okay.

77
00:12:39,409 --> 00:12:41,161
Have a wonderful time.

78
00:12:41,703 --> 00:12:42,704
Thank you.

79
00:12:44,414 --> 00:12:45,457
I told you.

80
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,292
She got the wrong idea.

81
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,002
Is it that unpleasant

82
00:12:49,711 --> 00:12:51,505
to be mistaken for my girlfriend?

83
00:12:51,588 --> 00:12:53,256
Why did you buy a matching outfit?

84
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:56,426
I just asked them to give me anything.

85
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,887
You're not worth my time and effort.

86
00:13:00,722 --> 00:13:01,681
That's true.

87
00:13:03,558 --> 00:13:05,519
I've never bought clothes
for someone else.

88
00:13:06,937 --> 00:13:09,439
Although it wasn't worth my trouble

89
00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:11,191
and I knew you wouldn't like it,

90
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,443
it's better than your wet clothes.

91
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:20,784
Thank you, sir.

92
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,578
I told you not to be fake.

93
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:25,622
I'm truly thankful.

94
00:13:26,456 --> 00:13:28,250
The shoes are just the right size too.

95
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,334
That's a relief.

96
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:31,211
I just picked a random size.

97
00:14:25,307 --> 00:14:26,850
Your food is ready.

98
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:28,435
Please enjoy.

99
00:14:29,394 --> 00:14:31,688
How are we supposed to eat all of this?

100
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:33,189
Why do we have to finish it?

101
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:34,524
Just eat whatever you want.

102
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:36,860
But that's so wasteful.

103
00:14:38,195 --> 00:14:39,529
I didn't know what you liked.

104
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:41,448
So you ordered all this food?

105
00:14:41,531 --> 00:14:42,699
Then you can tell me.

106
00:14:43,325 --> 00:14:45,410
- What?
- The things you like.

107
00:14:46,244 --> 00:14:47,662
Your favorite food,

108
00:14:47,746 --> 00:14:49,789
your favorite weather,
your favorite color.

109
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:53,293
Tell me everything you like.

110
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:57,464
Why do you want to know that?

111
00:14:57,547 --> 00:14:58,965
That way I won't waste anything

112
00:14:59,716 --> 00:15:01,509
and can focus on what you like.

113
00:15:20,362 --> 00:15:22,405
This meal will be on me.

114
00:15:27,285 --> 00:15:28,453
It's your birthday.

115
00:15:28,536 --> 00:15:30,914
Just let me buy you a meal.

116
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,834
I don't usually celebrate my birthday.

117
00:15:34,918 --> 00:15:35,752
Why not?

118
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:39,965
Because it's a day
that makes me feel insignificant.

119
00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:43,635
I get my hopes up,
and I'm constantly let down.

120
00:15:44,552 --> 00:15:47,806
Not having any expectations
gives me peace of mind.

121
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:49,933
But that's a fake feeling.

122
00:15:51,768 --> 00:15:53,478
You're fooling yourself.

123
00:15:53,561 --> 00:15:54,854
It's a false comfort.

124
00:15:56,231 --> 00:15:57,482
You're so fake.

125
00:16:10,996 --> 00:16:12,205
I hope you enjoy the food.

126
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:14,082
It's on me.

127
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:24,009
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

128
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:28,722
Your total is 1,684,000 won.

129
00:16:28,805 --> 00:16:29,639
Why?

130
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,224
Pardon?

131
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:33,226
It's nothing.

132
00:16:40,442 --> 00:16:41,651
I'll pay with this.

133
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:45,613
- Here you go.
- No, this is on me.

134
00:16:45,697 --> 00:16:47,824
It's your birthday privilege.

135
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:49,326
Enjoy it to the fullest.

136
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:51,244
Excuse me, sir.

137
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:53,830
I need your signature.

138
00:17:00,295 --> 00:17:01,338
Thank you.

139
00:17:04,132 --> 00:17:05,133
Thank you.

140
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:25,612
Thank you. Get home safe.

141
00:17:25,695 --> 00:17:26,529
Hang on.

142
00:17:38,249 --> 00:17:41,169
You might think it's an insignificant day,
but end it on a sweet note.

143
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,466
What? Do you not like cake?

144
00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:48,802
No.

145
00:17:51,221 --> 00:17:52,305
I love cake.

146
00:17:52,847 --> 00:17:54,641
Thank you. I appreciate it.

147
00:17:54,724 --> 00:17:58,895
I asked our hotel's head chef to make it,
so it'll probably taste good.

148
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:00,814
The head chef? When?

149
00:18:01,856 --> 00:18:03,483
I asked him to have it made and delivered

150
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,693
as we walked into the restaurant.

151
00:18:06,611 --> 00:18:08,321
He was probably getting ready to go home.

152
00:18:08,405 --> 00:18:11,908
That is why I very politely made
a special request.

153
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:13,910
That's what you call being a nuisance.

154
00:18:14,577 --> 00:18:17,080
It was a special request
from the head manager.

155
00:18:17,664 --> 00:18:19,541
It may seem like a simple favor to you,

156
00:18:19,624 --> 00:18:22,377
but for us,
it's an order that must be obeyed.

157
00:18:23,002 --> 00:18:25,380
He probably couldn't get off work
because of me.

158
00:18:26,673 --> 00:18:28,383
I didn't think that far ahead.

159
00:18:29,217 --> 00:18:30,510
I'll be more mindful next time.

160
00:18:34,305 --> 00:18:37,308
Thank you so much for today.

161
00:18:38,435 --> 00:18:39,811
Thank you for the cake too.

162
00:18:41,438 --> 00:18:42,564
- Head inside.
- Okay.

163
00:18:47,569 --> 00:18:48,403
Of course.

164
00:18:51,281 --> 00:18:52,866
I knew it.

165
00:18:52,949 --> 00:18:54,909
Something was fishy.

166
00:18:54,993 --> 00:18:56,619
Is this why you broke up with me?

167
00:18:57,704 --> 00:18:59,038
This was your plan all along.

168
00:19:00,498 --> 00:19:01,458
Why are you here?

169
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:02,625
Why is he here?

170
00:19:05,795 --> 00:19:06,629
Who are you?

171
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:07,672
Who are <i>you?</i>

172
00:19:07,755 --> 00:19:09,382
Me? I'm Sa-rang's boyfriend.

173
00:19:09,966 --> 00:19:11,509
How are you my boyfriend?

174
00:19:11,593 --> 00:19:12,635
You're my ex.

175
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:14,637
Your ex? Who, me?

176
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:17,640
We broke up so that makes you my ex.

177
00:19:17,724 --> 00:19:19,017
Who is this jerk?

178
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,477
It's none of your business.

179
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,896
- Why is it none of my business?
- You're her ex.

180
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:25,899
Then it's none of your business now.

181
00:19:25,982 --> 00:19:27,025
You stay out of this.

182
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:30,737
This is enough.

183
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,197
I know you're regretting it.

184
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,324
Just swallow your pride
and come back to me.

185
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:35,992
<i>Police. How can I help you?</i>

186
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:36,910
Hello?

187
00:19:37,494 --> 00:19:39,579
A stalker keeps following me to my house.

188
00:19:39,662 --> 00:19:41,789
- The address is--
- Hey, are you serious?

189
00:19:41,873 --> 00:19:43,416
You won't listen if I ask nicely.

190
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,502
I have no choice but to report you.

191
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:46,794
You better leave, or else.

192
00:19:46,878 --> 00:19:48,546
Why do you keep telling me to leave?

193
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:49,839
Do you feel guilty?

194
00:19:49,923 --> 00:19:50,924
You were two-timing, right?

195
00:19:51,007 --> 00:19:52,258
- Hey!
- What?

196
00:19:54,677 --> 00:19:56,930
It was the right decision
to break up with you.

197
00:19:57,847 --> 00:20:00,099
I should've done it a lot sooner.

198
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:02,769
If you

199
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:06,356
ever show your face again,
I'll kill you. Got that?

200
00:20:11,194 --> 00:20:12,570
If you walk away, it's over.

201
00:20:13,488 --> 00:20:14,739
There's no going back.

202
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:16,908
It's really over for us!

203
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,452
That little…

204
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:23,248
- What's your deal?
- She told you to leave.

205
00:20:23,331 --> 00:20:25,458
- Let go.
- Didn't you hear her?

206
00:20:26,334 --> 00:20:28,586
She was crying alone
on her birthday, no less.

207
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:30,964
I just barely got her to smile.

208
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:32,757
Don't ruin it. Just leave.

209
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,008
Who are you to…

210
00:20:35,843 --> 00:20:37,095
Let go.

211
00:20:37,178 --> 00:20:38,346
I said let go!

212
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,600
Let go.

213
00:20:43,518 --> 00:20:44,561
Let go, please.

214
00:20:44,644 --> 00:20:46,813
She doesn't want to see you anymore.

215
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:50,692
Stalking someone and harassing them
is considered violence.

216
00:20:51,276 --> 00:20:52,986
If you ever want to meet her,

217
00:20:53,069 --> 00:20:54,737
ask her politely in advance.

218
00:20:56,114 --> 00:20:57,115
Got that?

219
00:21:03,997 --> 00:21:06,332
Gosh, darn it.

220
00:21:10,378 --> 00:21:11,421
You'll pay for this.

221
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:48,499
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

222
00:21:54,422 --> 00:21:56,007
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

223
00:22:01,429 --> 00:22:02,639
Does she not know it's me?

224
00:22:03,139 --> 00:22:05,683
THANK YOU

225
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:13,775
<i>You know who this is, right?</i>

226
00:22:21,532 --> 00:22:23,284
- Hello?
- It's me.

227
00:22:23,993 --> 00:22:24,911
I know.

228
00:22:25,578 --> 00:22:27,413
Then why didn't you reply?

229
00:22:27,497 --> 00:22:29,165
You didn't give me the chance to.

230
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,293
By any chance,

231
00:22:32,794 --> 00:22:34,879
if something like that happens again,

232
00:22:35,797 --> 00:22:36,923
just call me.

233
00:22:37,006 --> 00:22:38,716
Don't bother the overworked police.

234
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,802
It won't happen again.

235
00:22:41,302 --> 00:22:42,678
Don't worry and get home safe.

236
00:22:42,762 --> 00:22:46,724
As your boss,
I'm only trying to keep my employee safe,

237
00:22:46,808 --> 00:22:48,309
so feel free to call me.

238
00:22:49,811 --> 00:22:51,312
Okay. I understand.

239
00:23:00,988 --> 00:23:01,864
Hello?

240
00:23:04,242 --> 00:23:05,451
Happy birthday.

241
00:23:08,496 --> 00:23:11,165
<i>I didn't get the chance
to tell you that earlier.</i>

242
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:15,753
Thank you.

243
00:23:16,879 --> 00:23:19,382
<i>All right then. Get some rest.</i>

244
00:23:19,882 --> 00:23:20,967
All right. You--

245
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,108
Let's go.

246
00:24:17,773 --> 00:24:21,319
<i>Congratulations</i>

247
00:24:21,402 --> 00:24:24,197
<i>Congratulations on being in last place</i>

248
00:24:26,949 --> 00:24:30,369
Our team is finally
the only team that ranked last!

249
00:24:32,455 --> 00:24:33,915
Why the long faces?

250
00:24:34,999 --> 00:24:36,709
Are you trying to screw me over?

251
00:24:37,335 --> 00:24:40,630
I was just humiliated
in front of all the managers.

252
00:24:41,756 --> 00:24:44,800
Since we achieved our goal,
we should celebrate.

253
00:24:46,969 --> 00:24:48,179
- We're sorry.
- We're sorry.

254
00:24:50,598 --> 00:24:51,641
"Sorry"?

255
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:53,476
Is this how you act when you're sorry?

256
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:55,478
Listen.

257
00:24:55,561 --> 00:24:57,563
Are you all in cahoots to get me sacked?

258
00:24:58,397 --> 00:24:59,774
Who's in charge of in-flight sales today?

259
00:25:01,609 --> 00:25:02,568
Me.

260
00:25:03,819 --> 00:25:07,532
In-flight sales begin
the moment passengers board.

261
00:25:07,615 --> 00:25:09,033
You have to grovel,

262
00:25:09,116 --> 00:25:10,368
put on a pretty smile,

263
00:25:10,451 --> 00:25:11,827
lift their luggage,

264
00:25:11,911 --> 00:25:13,037
serve them their food,

265
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,914
and do all that you can

266
00:25:14,997 --> 00:25:17,875
so that the passengers
can't help but think,

267
00:25:17,959 --> 00:25:20,294
"Wow, I really should
buy something from her."

268
00:25:20,378 --> 00:25:22,171
- Yes, ma'am.
- Mark my words.

269
00:25:22,255 --> 00:25:25,967
If we don't come in first this month,
we're all going down together.

270
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:28,636
Is that clear?

271
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,304
- Yes, ma'am!
- Yes, ma'am!

272
00:25:35,059 --> 00:25:35,935
Here you go, ma'am.

273
00:25:36,894 --> 00:25:40,273
Speak casually when we're alone.
We started at the same time after all.

274
00:25:41,732 --> 00:25:42,608
Okay.

275
00:25:42,692 --> 00:25:44,110
You should get that promotion this year.

276
00:25:46,821 --> 00:25:48,114
I want to,

277
00:25:48,739 --> 00:25:50,283
but I might have to give up on it.

278
00:25:50,366 --> 00:25:53,286
You don't want to be looked down on
your whole life, do you?

279
00:25:54,036 --> 00:25:56,247
All of our colleagues are pursers now.

280
00:25:57,456 --> 00:25:58,833
Only you wear a white scarf.

281
00:26:00,835 --> 00:26:04,255
Because of that,
they all secretly think little of you.

282
00:26:04,338 --> 00:26:06,841
They even made a group chat without you.
How childish.

283
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:10,344
There's a group chat without me?

284
00:26:10,928 --> 00:26:12,138
That's what I'm saying.

285
00:26:12,847 --> 00:26:15,182
All the more reason for you
to get that promotion.

286
00:26:15,266 --> 00:26:18,936
What good are your top scores
in some language certifications?

287
00:26:19,478 --> 00:26:21,522
You don't have anyone
to pull strings for you.

288
00:26:22,815 --> 00:26:23,899
I'll help you.

289
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:26,944
Really?

290
00:26:27,028 --> 00:26:29,405
Increase the in-flight sales in return.

291
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:31,198
If we rank first,

292
00:26:31,282 --> 00:26:33,534
I'll make sure
to pull some strings for you.

293
00:26:35,494 --> 00:26:36,912
Okay, I will.

294
00:26:37,747 --> 00:26:39,165
I'll do my best.

295
00:26:53,554 --> 00:26:54,680
I'm home.

296
00:26:55,264 --> 00:26:56,098
Hey.

297
00:26:58,309 --> 00:26:59,644
There you guys go again.

298
00:27:19,872 --> 00:27:21,749
- What?
- Why would you do that?

299
00:27:22,625 --> 00:27:23,584
Hey, what's--

300
00:27:30,424 --> 00:27:31,342
So,

301
00:27:31,425 --> 00:27:32,927
there's nothing going on,

302
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:35,888
but he bought you something
from Thom Brownie for getting wet?

303
00:27:37,056 --> 00:27:37,973
I know, right?

304
00:27:38,057 --> 00:27:40,184
And you're not going to tell us who he is?

305
00:27:43,604 --> 00:27:44,522
Okay. Fine.

306
00:27:45,314 --> 00:27:48,317
Whoever he is, he's definitely trying
to win you over with money.

307
00:27:48,401 --> 00:27:49,610
It's not like that.

308
00:27:49,694 --> 00:27:52,029
I just asked them to give me anything.

309
00:27:52,113 --> 00:27:53,906
You're not worth my time and effort.

310
00:27:53,989 --> 00:27:55,950
Do you know how much this costs?

311
00:27:56,033 --> 00:27:57,743
He bought all this
when he doesn't even like you?

312
00:27:58,911 --> 00:28:02,206
Hey, men don't spend money
on women they're not interested in.

313
00:28:02,289 --> 00:28:04,667
If he's this into you, just date him.

314
00:28:05,543 --> 00:28:07,086
I'm all for it too.

315
00:28:07,169 --> 00:28:10,715
He even bought you shoes
because yours were wet.

316
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:12,758
How did he know your shoe size?

317
00:28:12,842 --> 00:28:13,759
Did you tell him?

318
00:28:15,553 --> 00:28:16,387
No.

319
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:17,471
That's a relief.

320
00:28:18,013 --> 00:28:19,390
I just picked a random size.

321
00:28:20,182 --> 00:28:23,018
You're going to show your appreciation
for this precious gift, right?

322
00:28:23,811 --> 00:28:24,895
I'm not sure.

323
00:28:26,313 --> 00:28:28,774
Think about it, ma'am.

324
00:28:28,858 --> 00:28:30,359
He gave you a gift and his heart.

325
00:28:30,443 --> 00:28:32,987
You'd be a horrible woman
if you didn't get him anything.

326
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,280
Where's your conscience?

327
00:28:35,322 --> 00:28:36,490
That's true.

328
00:28:37,074 --> 00:28:38,743
But I don't know what he likes

329
00:28:38,826 --> 00:28:40,578
and he's very particular.

330
00:28:40,661 --> 00:28:42,705
Don't worry, ma'am.

331
00:28:42,788 --> 00:28:45,583
At Alanga, we have
a brand-new card wallet that's perfect

332
00:28:45,666 --> 00:28:47,293
for even the pickiest of customers.

333
00:28:47,376 --> 00:28:49,795
Stop trying to sell me stuff.
You don't even know who he is.

334
00:28:49,879 --> 00:28:51,422
I'll give you a big discount.

335
00:28:52,089 --> 00:28:53,966
Forget it. I'm not buying anything.

336
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,803
Ma'am, what do you think of this cologne?

337
00:28:57,887 --> 00:29:00,431
It's not too expensive
and it's the most popular item

338
00:29:00,514 --> 00:29:01,849
among young men these days.

339
00:29:01,932 --> 00:29:05,019
I think it'll be perfect
for his sophisticated style.

340
00:29:05,102 --> 00:29:06,645
Would you like one?

341
00:29:06,729 --> 00:29:08,522
Why are you butting in all of a sudden?

342
00:29:08,606 --> 00:29:09,440
You brat.

343
00:29:10,191 --> 00:29:11,609
I'm desperate.

344
00:29:11,692 --> 00:29:13,194
Please understand.

345
00:29:13,277 --> 00:29:14,111
What?

346
00:29:14,195 --> 00:29:16,030
Did you not meet your sales quota again?

347
00:29:16,113 --> 00:29:17,615
We came in last again.

348
00:29:17,698 --> 00:29:19,241
Please help me out, Ms. Gang.

349
00:29:20,284 --> 00:29:21,327
Buy the cologne.

350
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:22,828
Buy two while you're at it.

351
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:25,039
I said I'm not going to!

352
00:29:25,122 --> 00:29:28,334
Please buy something!
You can't deplane without buying anything.

353
00:29:29,752 --> 00:29:30,836
What's wrong with you?

354
00:29:31,879 --> 00:29:32,838
Are you Gang Da-eul?

355
00:29:33,672 --> 00:29:35,382
What happened to our kind Pyeong-hwa?

356
00:29:35,466 --> 00:29:37,843
Snap out of it. Come to your senses!

357
00:29:38,469 --> 00:29:41,013
The flight attendants at King Air
reduce our own luggage

358
00:29:41,097 --> 00:29:44,141
to have a large stock of duty-free items.

359
00:29:44,225 --> 00:29:45,226
We have everything.

360
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,645
Please buy something from me.

361
00:29:52,608 --> 00:29:54,443
- I won't.
- Hey, come on!

362
00:29:55,569 --> 00:29:56,570
Ma'am?

363
00:29:56,654 --> 00:29:58,197
You can't do this to me.

364
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,075
If you didn't like that product,
there are many others, ma'am.

365
00:30:01,158 --> 00:30:03,786
Please buy something from me.

366
00:30:05,329 --> 00:30:06,705
No thanks.

367
00:30:07,289 --> 00:30:08,541
Hey!

368
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:11,627
Ms. Lovely Sa-rang, please come out and…

369
00:30:40,197 --> 00:30:44,243
Next week will be Super Farmer Week,
hosted by the purchasing team.

370
00:30:44,785 --> 00:30:47,204
We ask for King the Land's support
this year as well.

371
00:30:47,288 --> 00:30:48,831
Super Farmer Week…

372
00:30:49,582 --> 00:30:50,624
What is that?

373
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,003
It's a week where we visit
vendors all across the country

374
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:55,713
who provide our hotel with premium produce

375
00:30:56,297 --> 00:30:58,382
and ask for their continued partnership.

376
00:31:01,594 --> 00:31:02,720
So we're soliciting.

377
00:31:04,013 --> 00:31:05,598
Nothing is free in this world.

378
00:31:05,681 --> 00:31:07,433
Great value demands great effort.

379
00:31:07,516 --> 00:31:10,060
Why does it have to be King the Land
and not the team in charge?

380
00:31:10,144 --> 00:31:11,604
That's why we hired them.

381
00:31:11,687 --> 00:31:14,356
They're too competent
to be running such errands.

382
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,482
Find other people to do it.

383
00:31:15,566 --> 00:31:16,567
This is my hotel.

384
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,820
That's for me to decide.

385
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,825
That's true for every part of the hotel,

386
00:31:25,326 --> 00:31:28,913
except for the area that I'm in charge of.

387
00:31:31,749 --> 00:31:32,666
Meeting adjourned.

388
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:33,709
I'm off.

389
00:31:59,944 --> 00:32:03,030
I know you feel comfortable around me,
but you should at least knock.

390
00:32:04,657 --> 00:32:06,158
- Where are you going?
- To knock.

391
00:32:07,701 --> 00:32:08,911
Don't come in.

392
00:32:13,582 --> 00:32:15,125
I told you not to come in.

393
00:32:21,966 --> 00:32:23,467
- What?
- Are you finally going head-to-head?

394
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,510
What do you mean?

395
00:32:25,094 --> 00:32:26,387
Ms. Gu worked hard on this event,

396
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:27,805
but you messed everything up.

397
00:32:27,888 --> 00:32:29,765
How is that an event? It's a scheme.

398
00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:32,476
That's not acceptable in this day and age.

399
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:35,145
I know you're just trying to help,
but you don't have that power yet.

400
00:32:35,229 --> 00:32:38,232
So why don't you just give in this time?

401
00:32:38,315 --> 00:32:39,900
In this case, losing is winning.

402
00:32:40,901 --> 00:32:42,861
I'm not trying to win.

403
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:45,322
I just don't want people
to run such errands.

404
00:32:46,323 --> 00:32:48,492
So long as you're here,

405
00:32:49,118 --> 00:32:50,160
there will be no peace.

406
00:32:54,373 --> 00:32:55,874
While I was in the UK,

407
00:32:55,958 --> 00:32:57,418
I dreamed of the day

408
00:32:57,501 --> 00:32:59,378
that I would return to Korea

409
00:32:59,461 --> 00:33:02,047
and make you the chairman
of King Group at all costs!

410
00:33:03,841 --> 00:33:04,967
That is why

411
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:09,263
I've been giving you
weekly trend reports of the group.

412
00:33:09,346 --> 00:33:11,432
Why haven't you looked at them?

413
00:33:33,495 --> 00:33:34,913
- What is this?
- Hey.

414
00:33:34,997 --> 00:33:35,914
Hey!

415
00:33:35,998 --> 00:33:37,499
- What is this?
- Give it back.

416
00:33:38,292 --> 00:33:40,210
- Fine. Here you go.
- Give it back.

417
00:33:40,294 --> 00:33:41,503
What is that?

418
00:33:41,587 --> 00:33:42,671
You could've torn it.

419
00:33:42,755 --> 00:33:44,173
Is it something you cherish?

420
00:33:44,256 --> 00:33:45,299
It's nothing.

421
00:33:45,382 --> 00:33:47,468
How so? You were wearing matching outfits.

422
00:33:47,551 --> 00:33:49,553
Don't be absurd. It's nothing like that.

423
00:33:49,636 --> 00:33:50,679
Yes, it is.

424
00:33:51,472 --> 00:33:53,307
Well, it was her birthday.

425
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,266
Her birthday?

426
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:56,643
Why didn't we ever wear
matching outfits on my birthday?

427
00:33:56,727 --> 00:33:58,062
It was an employee benefit.

428
00:33:58,645 --> 00:34:02,107
Then can you get me a matching outfit
as an employee benefit?

429
00:34:02,191 --> 00:34:03,525
I want one too!

430
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:09,865
I'm sorry.

431
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:12,242
Get over here!

432
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:25,130
He almost ripped it.

433
00:34:38,727 --> 00:34:41,146
<i>Are you busy after work today?</i>

434
00:34:42,731 --> 00:34:43,774
<i>No, not at all.</i>

435
00:34:46,693 --> 00:34:47,694
Wait.

436
00:34:51,407 --> 00:34:53,450
ARE YOU BUSY AFTER WORK TODAY?

437
00:34:59,873 --> 00:35:01,083
<i>Of course I am.</i>

438
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,505
<i>All right, then.</i>

439
00:35:06,588 --> 00:35:07,423
What?

440
00:35:07,506 --> 00:35:08,590
That's it?

441
00:35:09,508 --> 00:35:10,676
This isn't what I wanted.

442
00:35:14,138 --> 00:35:16,348
What's the matter?

443
00:35:28,735 --> 00:35:31,280
I will probably have
a few minutes to spare.

444
00:35:40,581 --> 00:35:44,168
Shall we meet for a moment after work?

445
00:36:00,476 --> 00:36:01,894
Why aren't you responding?

446
00:36:05,314 --> 00:36:06,440
Oh, gosh.

447
00:36:08,817 --> 00:36:10,235
Did I have to come here myself?

448
00:36:10,861 --> 00:36:12,613
- Why are you here?
- Why didn't you reply?

449
00:36:13,322 --> 00:36:14,740
- Reply to what?
- My text.

450
00:36:14,823 --> 00:36:16,700
- I did.
- And I replied to your reply.

451
00:36:16,783 --> 00:36:17,910
I'm working right now.

452
00:36:18,785 --> 00:36:20,078
Give this to me.

453
00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:23,790
We're not allowed
to check our phones while working.

454
00:36:29,922 --> 00:36:31,006
Why did you

455
00:36:31,924 --> 00:36:32,758
want to see me?

456
00:36:34,009 --> 00:36:35,511
I thought you were busy.

457
00:36:38,388 --> 00:36:39,431
What

458
00:36:40,098 --> 00:36:40,974
is it about?

459
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:46,230
What is it?

460
00:36:47,773 --> 00:36:48,649
Well…

461
00:36:50,817 --> 00:36:52,402
I was just wondering…

462
00:36:54,947 --> 00:36:56,990
if we could meet up after work.

463
00:37:24,893 --> 00:37:25,978
I'm extremely busy.

464
00:37:27,354 --> 00:37:28,522
But I shall give up

465
00:37:29,648 --> 00:37:30,816
my precious time for you.

466
00:37:30,899 --> 00:37:32,693
It's fine. You don't have to.

467
00:37:32,776 --> 00:37:33,860
I'll give you

468
00:37:34,903 --> 00:37:36,071
my precious time.

469
00:37:39,241 --> 00:37:40,284
See you later.

470
00:37:57,843 --> 00:38:00,512
- He's so cool.
- What makes you think that?

471
00:38:00,596 --> 00:38:03,390
We don't have to participate
in Super Farmer Week this year.

472
00:38:03,473 --> 00:38:05,350
- Really?
- We were always made to go

473
00:38:05,434 --> 00:38:07,185
when it's the purchasing team's job.

474
00:38:07,269 --> 00:38:09,896
Mr. Gu didn't approve,
saying it wasn't in our job scope.

475
00:38:11,064 --> 00:38:12,941
It feels like heaven
now that our manager changed.

476
00:38:13,025 --> 00:38:14,818
Even his name means "salvation."

477
00:38:14,901 --> 00:38:16,528
He came here to save us.

478
00:38:16,612 --> 00:38:19,281
He's our hero.

479
00:38:21,325 --> 00:38:24,161
I hope he becomes the chairman too.

480
00:38:24,244 --> 00:38:26,246
Is not participating in that event
such great news?

481
00:38:30,876 --> 00:38:32,586
You've never been, have you?

482
00:38:32,669 --> 00:38:35,005
- No.
- Then you shouldn't comment.

483
00:38:35,797 --> 00:38:38,216
By the way,
what did you talk about with Mr. Gu?

484
00:38:38,884 --> 00:38:40,177
Did you get on his bad side?

485
00:38:46,266 --> 00:38:48,101
He gave me words of encouragement.

486
00:38:48,185 --> 00:38:49,227
"You got this."

487
00:38:50,937 --> 00:38:52,814
- "You got this"?
- Yes.

488
00:39:10,415 --> 00:39:11,249
Don't…

489
00:39:11,875 --> 00:39:12,709
Don't get out.

490
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:15,712
Why not?

491
00:39:16,254 --> 00:39:17,214
People can see us.

492
00:39:17,297 --> 00:39:18,507
Are we committing a crime?

493
00:39:19,049 --> 00:39:20,133
No, please.

494
00:39:21,593 --> 00:39:23,261
Can you just lower your window?

495
00:39:25,138 --> 00:39:26,264
Jeez.

496
00:39:28,934 --> 00:39:29,935
What is it?

497
00:39:31,895 --> 00:39:32,979
Here.

498
00:39:36,858 --> 00:39:37,818
What is this?

499
00:39:38,819 --> 00:39:40,153
It's nothing much.

500
00:39:40,237 --> 00:39:42,572
It's just to express my thanks
for the other day.

501
00:39:46,785 --> 00:39:48,495
You didn't need to give me anything.

502
00:39:49,663 --> 00:39:50,831
- Then give it back.
- Wait.

503
00:39:51,707 --> 00:39:53,041
I appreciate your kindness.

504
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:55,419
- So I'll accept it.
- You don't have to.

505
00:39:56,962 --> 00:39:58,046
I'll accept it.

506
00:39:58,797 --> 00:39:59,840
Sa-rang.

507
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,717
- Yes.
- Are you not going home?

508
00:40:02,384 --> 00:40:03,802
Goodbye. Take care.

509
00:40:10,767 --> 00:40:11,768
Get home safe.

510
00:40:11,852 --> 00:40:13,895
You're leaving already?

511
00:40:13,979 --> 00:40:15,814
Yes. I thought you were busy.

512
00:40:15,897 --> 00:40:17,774
You should go.
I won't waste your precious time.

513
00:40:21,737 --> 00:40:22,821
Gosh.

514
00:40:24,656 --> 00:40:25,824
Let's eat.

515
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:27,784
Sorry?

516
00:40:30,787 --> 00:40:31,830
I'm hungry.

517
00:40:39,796 --> 00:40:40,630
Okay.

518
00:40:41,173 --> 00:40:42,048
I'll buy this time.

519
00:40:43,925 --> 00:40:44,843
Hurry.

520
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:51,141
Customer number 159.

521
00:40:51,224 --> 00:40:52,559
- Yes.
- It's not us.

522
00:40:57,981 --> 00:40:59,232
What number are we?

523
00:40:59,316 --> 00:41:00,233
Just wait.

524
00:41:03,236 --> 00:41:05,363
All this just for one meal?

525
00:41:05,447 --> 00:41:08,033
This place is popular,
so they don't take reservations.

526
00:41:08,116 --> 00:41:10,118
I've never waited for anything in my life.

527
00:41:10,702 --> 00:41:11,661
Clearly.

528
00:41:17,167 --> 00:41:19,628
How good must this restaurant be
for people to line up

529
00:41:19,711 --> 00:41:20,962
and waste their time?

530
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:24,049
For someone like me, time is--

531
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,343
Let's go. We can come next time.

532
00:41:27,636 --> 00:41:28,470
Why?

533
00:41:28,553 --> 00:41:30,764
I don't want to waste your precious time,

534
00:41:30,847 --> 00:41:32,933
so I'll make a reservation next time.

535
00:41:33,016 --> 00:41:35,143
You didn't listen to
what I had to say next.

536
00:41:36,478 --> 00:41:37,562
Suddenly…

537
00:41:38,814 --> 00:41:39,981
Suddenly,

538
00:41:41,566 --> 00:41:43,777
I became curious to know
what waiting feels like.

539
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:46,738
I will try experiencing what it's like.

540
00:41:48,073 --> 00:41:49,574
You don't have to.

541
00:41:49,658 --> 00:41:50,700
I will,

542
00:41:51,326 --> 00:41:52,577
even if I don't have to.

543
00:41:55,205 --> 00:41:56,039
Sit down.

544
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:06,216
I've always had to wait for everything.

545
00:42:06,883 --> 00:42:09,427
Whether it was for the bus or the taxi,
I always waited.

546
00:42:10,387 --> 00:42:12,180
"When will it be my turn?"

547
00:42:12,264 --> 00:42:15,141
"What if the line cuts off
in front of me and I lose my chance?"

548
00:42:16,309 --> 00:42:17,602
But someone told me

549
00:42:18,311 --> 00:42:20,480
that the countless people waiting in line

550
00:42:20,564 --> 00:42:23,066
work for those
who never have to wait in line.

551
00:42:24,985 --> 00:42:26,903
Looking at us, I think they were right.

552
00:42:28,071 --> 00:42:31,908
Why would you segregate people
over something as trivial as lining up?

553
00:42:31,992 --> 00:42:32,909
You're so heartless.

554
00:42:34,744 --> 00:42:36,580
Customer number 161.

555
00:42:36,663 --> 00:42:38,039
It's not us.

556
00:42:38,623 --> 00:42:39,708
Oh, it <i>is </i>us.

557
00:42:48,008 --> 00:42:49,050
Is something on fire?

558
00:42:50,427 --> 00:42:52,721
Have you never seen that before?

559
00:42:53,722 --> 00:42:54,890
Don't tell me

560
00:42:55,807 --> 00:42:58,476
they're going to be that rowdy
when they cook our food too.

561
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,686
They will. Why?

562
00:43:00,353 --> 00:43:02,022
Food should be eaten quietly.

563
00:43:02,105 --> 00:43:04,900
This place is so chaotic
and uncomfortable.

564
00:43:06,776 --> 00:43:08,653
I only come here on special occasions.

565
00:43:08,737 --> 00:43:10,155
If you're going to whine, we can leave.

566
00:43:10,238 --> 00:43:11,072
Wait.

567
00:43:13,325 --> 00:43:14,868
It's very uncomfortable,

568
00:43:15,619 --> 00:43:16,745
but I'll suck it up.

569
00:43:18,663 --> 00:43:19,956
Are you ready to order?

570
00:43:20,582 --> 00:43:22,918
Yes, can you give us two special sets?

571
00:43:23,001 --> 00:43:25,420
- What will you have to drink?
- Louise-Conti.

572
00:43:25,503 --> 00:43:26,838
Sorry? What was that?

573
00:43:27,964 --> 00:43:28,840
Louise-Conti.

574
00:43:29,424 --> 00:43:30,508
Two draft beers, please.

575
00:43:30,592 --> 00:43:32,010
- All right.
- Thank you.

576
00:43:32,677 --> 00:43:34,971
I'm buying tonight, so it's up to me.

577
00:43:41,645 --> 00:43:45,398
Does the beer taste better
if the mug is cold?

578
00:43:45,982 --> 00:43:49,069
People focus too much on the packaging
while neglecting the essence.

579
00:43:49,152 --> 00:43:50,445
You don't know anything.

580
00:43:50,987 --> 00:43:52,405
Give it to me. I'll drink it.

581
00:43:52,948 --> 00:43:55,116
I appreciate the gesture,
so I'll drink it all.

582
00:43:56,034 --> 00:43:57,202
Are you doing me a favor?

583
00:43:57,285 --> 00:43:59,829
"I'll make time, I'll wait,
I'll suck it up for you."

584
00:44:01,539 --> 00:44:02,874
I'll also clink my mug for you.

585
00:44:04,542 --> 00:44:07,212
It is such an honor
to be able to clink mugs with you, sir.

586
00:44:15,887 --> 00:44:16,930
What in the world?

587
00:44:17,639 --> 00:44:18,473
What do you think?

588
00:44:18,556 --> 00:44:20,517
- Isn't it amazing?
- It's good.

589
00:44:21,101 --> 00:44:22,852
What? Why is it good?

590
00:44:37,283 --> 00:44:38,618
Why is this so good?

591
00:44:40,787 --> 00:44:41,997
Can I get a refill?

592
00:44:50,463 --> 00:44:52,132
When will our food come out?

593
00:45:10,692 --> 00:45:11,901
You scaredy-cat.

594
00:45:11,985 --> 00:45:13,319
I wasn't scared.

595
00:45:13,903 --> 00:45:14,779
I…

596
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,990
I was just acting startled

597
00:45:17,073 --> 00:45:19,242
in return for his performance.

598
00:45:19,325 --> 00:45:20,869
Yes, sure you were.

599
00:45:23,913 --> 00:45:25,331
The finger thing was slightly…

600
00:45:27,584 --> 00:45:28,752
Can we eat now?

601
00:45:28,835 --> 00:45:30,044
Yes, try it.

602
00:45:36,384 --> 00:45:37,594
Isn't it tasty?

603
00:45:58,990 --> 00:45:59,991
That…

604
00:46:04,162 --> 00:46:05,663
He made a heart.

605
00:46:06,164 --> 00:46:07,499
How in the world…

606
00:46:08,082 --> 00:46:09,709
One, two, three.

607
00:46:10,502 --> 00:46:12,629
Let me take some more pictures. One, two…

608
00:46:12,712 --> 00:46:13,963
Look, it's a heart.

609
00:46:15,965 --> 00:46:17,008
Who gets to eat it?

610
00:46:19,719 --> 00:46:21,054
What should we eat next time?

611
00:46:22,555 --> 00:46:23,765
With me?

612
00:46:23,848 --> 00:46:24,766
Then…

613
00:46:25,683 --> 00:46:26,726
is this it?

614
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:28,853
Yes, this is it.

615
00:46:29,354 --> 00:46:30,188
Why?

616
00:46:30,814 --> 00:46:34,651
Because I feel uncomfortable
eating alone with you.

617
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:38,488
But I don't.

618
00:46:39,656 --> 00:46:40,865
When should we meet again?

619
00:46:41,533 --> 00:46:42,826
I said I'm not going to.

620
00:46:42,909 --> 00:46:44,744
- Why not?
- Because it's uncomfortable.

621
00:46:44,828 --> 00:46:47,038
- Not for me.
- Is that all that matters?

622
00:46:48,706 --> 00:46:49,666
Fine.

623
00:46:50,458 --> 00:46:51,835
Be comfortable around me now.

624
00:46:53,211 --> 00:46:54,379
I'll allow it.

625
00:46:59,342 --> 00:47:00,176
What?

626
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,345
You know how to smile?

627
00:47:04,973 --> 00:47:07,642
If you knew how to smile,
you should've smiled in Jeju.

628
00:47:10,645 --> 00:47:12,397
You're mistaken. I don't like smiling.

629
00:47:19,904 --> 00:47:21,281
How about some meat next time?

630
00:47:21,364 --> 00:47:23,074
I know an excellent restaurant.

631
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:25,994
No, thank you.
You can go with your friends.

632
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,288
I don't have any friends.

633
00:47:29,622 --> 00:47:30,623
Why not?

634
00:47:31,541 --> 00:47:33,084
Because I don't need any.

635
00:47:37,297 --> 00:47:39,048
Then what do you think about pasta?

636
00:47:41,134 --> 00:47:43,011
- Well--
- Fine. I'll decide.

637
00:47:43,678 --> 00:47:44,679
Excuse me.

638
00:47:44,762 --> 00:47:47,223
- You said no to meat, so pasta.
- Can you not hear me?

639
00:47:47,307 --> 00:47:49,100
- Types of pasta…
- Hello?

640
00:47:49,183 --> 00:47:50,435
-There's clam pasta,
-Hello?

641
00:47:50,518 --> 00:47:52,145
-garlic pasta,
-Can't you hear me?

642
00:47:52,228 --> 00:47:55,148
- and creamy flying fish roe pasta.
- Hello? I said I'm not going.

643
00:47:55,231 --> 00:47:56,774
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm going.

644
00:47:57,275 --> 00:47:58,985
I'm going. Won't you join me?

645
00:48:09,162 --> 00:48:11,539
Were you trying to surprise me?
You came unannounced.

646
00:48:22,342 --> 00:48:23,343
Did you have dinner?

647
00:48:24,052 --> 00:48:25,219
Should I order something?

648
00:48:32,518 --> 00:48:33,561
I have something to tell you.

649
00:48:36,564 --> 00:48:37,732
Let's get divorced.

650
00:48:40,485 --> 00:48:41,861
I'm in love with someone else.

651
00:48:43,154 --> 00:48:44,447
How long will this one last?

652
00:48:45,657 --> 00:48:46,783
Just have some fun.

653
00:48:46,866 --> 00:48:48,701
I'm really in love with her.

654
00:48:52,622 --> 00:48:53,623
Okay.

655
00:48:54,415 --> 00:48:55,750
Love her with all your heart.

656
00:48:56,709 --> 00:48:58,044
I'm not stopping you.

657
00:48:58,795 --> 00:48:59,963
But we can't get divorced now.

658
00:49:00,046 --> 00:49:01,422
I don't need any money.

659
00:49:01,506 --> 00:49:02,840
I just want a divorce.

660
00:49:02,924 --> 00:49:04,884
I'm at war with Won right now.

661
00:49:05,885 --> 00:49:07,887
Father hasn't chosen a successor yet.

662
00:49:08,471 --> 00:49:10,139
Don't get in my way and wait.

663
00:49:10,223 --> 00:49:12,725
I'll do what you want
after I inherit King Group.

664
00:49:13,518 --> 00:49:15,353
- Hwa-ran.
- You don't get to abandon me.

665
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:19,023
You can't leave until I let you.

666
00:49:39,627 --> 00:49:41,129
Surprise!

667
00:49:41,212 --> 00:49:42,088
What is this?

668
00:49:42,171 --> 00:49:44,632
Isn't today your wedding anniversary?

669
00:49:45,216 --> 00:49:47,927
This is my special gift
for the two of you.

670
00:49:48,011 --> 00:49:49,470
From the bottom of my heart,

671
00:49:49,554 --> 00:49:51,264
I wish you a happy anniversary!

672
00:49:53,433 --> 00:49:55,685
Thank you. You can place them inside.

673
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,779
Dr. Yoon is back in Korea?

674
00:50:07,363 --> 00:50:10,199
He flew in urgently because of work,
so he couldn't contact us.

675
00:50:11,325 --> 00:50:12,785
I heard he was seeing someone.

676
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:14,912
It's just a fling.

677
00:50:16,289 --> 00:50:17,832
Make sure word doesn't get out.

678
00:50:17,915 --> 00:50:19,375
I will. Don't worry.

679
00:50:20,334 --> 00:50:21,711
I'm not worried for your sake.

680
00:50:21,794 --> 00:50:23,463
If people start to gossip,

681
00:50:23,546 --> 00:50:25,923
we'll waste money
trying to block the articles.

682
00:50:37,769 --> 00:50:40,229
Give your approval for Super Farmer Week
by tomorrow morning.

683
00:50:40,313 --> 00:50:42,148
Didn't I tell you we're not doing that?

684
00:50:42,231 --> 00:50:44,317
Do you think you're doing them a favor?

685
00:50:45,443 --> 00:50:47,111
The employees are there to get paid.

686
00:50:47,737 --> 00:50:49,072
We can make them do anything.

687
00:50:49,155 --> 00:50:52,325
Even if we pay them,
I won't make them do stuff like that.

688
00:50:54,243 --> 00:50:55,328
How heroic of you.

689
00:50:55,912 --> 00:50:58,247
You don't know
what they truly desire, do you?

690
00:50:58,331 --> 00:50:59,791
It's money.

691
00:50:59,874 --> 00:51:00,958
Nothing else.

692
00:51:01,542 --> 00:51:03,294
Quit acting up and sign the papers.

693
00:51:20,645 --> 00:51:21,687
Welcome.

694
00:51:21,771 --> 00:51:22,688
Welcome.

695
00:51:23,231 --> 00:51:24,440
Welcome.

696
00:51:26,484 --> 00:51:29,946
I'm sorry, but your dog could be
an inconvenience to other customers.

697
00:51:30,029 --> 00:51:31,864
Do you think you can hold your dog?

698
00:51:31,948 --> 00:51:33,950
I'll leave right after buying one thing.

699
00:51:34,033 --> 00:51:35,535
We ask for your understanding.

700
00:51:35,618 --> 00:51:37,995
If I have to carry Charles while I shop,

701
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:39,872
it'll be an inconvenience for me.

702
00:51:39,956 --> 00:51:41,833
Am I the only one that has to suffer?

703
00:51:44,794 --> 00:51:46,212
It's okay, buddy.

704
00:51:46,295 --> 00:51:47,922
We'll leave after buying one thing.

705
00:51:48,631 --> 00:51:50,091
You know who she is, don't you?

706
00:51:50,174 --> 00:51:51,259
The national mom,

707
00:51:51,342 --> 00:51:52,927
actress Mo Seong-ae.

708
00:51:53,636 --> 00:51:56,806
I'm sorry, but your dog
might scare the other customers.

709
00:51:56,889 --> 00:51:58,474
Please understand.

710
00:51:58,558 --> 00:52:00,017
Are you trying to start something?

711
00:52:00,601 --> 00:52:01,435
Fine.

712
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:04,063
I normally wouldn't care
if I couldn't shop at a store,

713
00:52:04,147 --> 00:52:06,149
but I will make sure to shop today!

714
00:52:11,612 --> 00:52:12,655
Oh, my.

715
00:52:14,198 --> 00:52:16,075
Ms. Gang, it's pooping!

716
00:52:21,873 --> 00:52:23,416
That feels nice, doesn't it?

717
00:52:23,499 --> 00:52:26,085
Charles, did you poop?

718
00:52:26,169 --> 00:52:27,295
Good job.

719
00:52:27,378 --> 00:52:29,463
- Let's go.
- Excuse me, ma'am.

720
00:52:30,006 --> 00:52:31,257
You have to clean it up.

721
00:52:31,841 --> 00:52:33,676
- What?
- Charles' poop.

722
00:52:34,343 --> 00:52:36,554
That's not for me to do.

723
00:52:36,637 --> 00:52:39,182
You guys are here
to do that kind of stuff.

724
00:52:39,265 --> 00:52:43,311
Also, Charles' poop is clean,
so it won't smell.

725
00:52:44,228 --> 00:52:46,480
Since it doesn't smell,
can you clean it yourself?

726
00:52:46,564 --> 00:52:48,357
You're so ridiculous.

727
00:52:48,441 --> 00:52:50,359
Earlier, you didn't even let me
enter the store.

728
00:52:50,443 --> 00:52:52,445
Now you want me to clean up some poop?

729
00:52:52,528 --> 00:52:54,405
Get me the manager!

730
00:52:55,323 --> 00:52:56,282
I'm the manager.

731
00:52:56,365 --> 00:52:57,783
How convenient.

732
00:52:57,867 --> 00:52:59,785
Manage the store and clean it up yourself.

733
00:52:59,869 --> 00:53:00,912
Ms. Gang, I'll do it.

734
00:53:00,995 --> 00:53:02,955
Don't. That's not our job.

735
00:53:03,873 --> 00:53:06,918
Ma'am, I'm sorry
but can you come inside and clean it up?

736
00:53:07,001 --> 00:53:08,127
Hey,

737
00:53:08,211 --> 00:53:11,631
I'm Mo Seong-ae, the national mom!

738
00:53:11,714 --> 00:53:12,924
Don't you know who I am?

739
00:53:13,716 --> 00:53:14,884
Hey, where are you going?

740
00:53:15,718 --> 00:53:17,094
What are you doing?

741
00:53:18,804 --> 00:53:21,098
Hey, why would you clean that up?

742
00:53:21,182 --> 00:53:23,643
Didn't I tell you
to know when to get involved?

743
00:53:23,726 --> 00:53:25,645
People are watching. Compose yourself.

744
00:53:26,229 --> 00:53:27,730
If someone posts this online,

745
00:53:27,813 --> 00:53:29,232
you'll come under fire again.

746
00:53:29,315 --> 00:53:33,569
I'm telling you, it's the lowlifes
that go on more power trips these days.

747
00:53:34,153 --> 00:53:36,405
I'll let this go
since I'm a kind, simple person.

748
00:53:36,489 --> 00:53:39,408
Consider yourself lucky
for meeting someone like me.

749
00:53:39,492 --> 00:53:41,202
I'm never coming here again!

750
00:53:41,285 --> 00:53:42,328
How ridiculous.

751
00:53:43,412 --> 00:53:44,830
Goodbye.

752
00:53:45,498 --> 00:53:48,834
Should I get a bag of salt
and throw it at her?

753
00:53:50,086 --> 00:53:51,128
Forget it.

754
00:53:51,212 --> 00:53:54,298
We just got unlucky.
Let's get over it with some spicy food.

755
00:53:54,382 --> 00:53:56,300
- Goodness.
- What should we eat?

756
00:53:59,303 --> 00:54:00,721
What's good here?

757
00:54:00,805 --> 00:54:02,974
That dish is the most popular these days.

758
00:54:04,141 --> 00:54:05,351
RECOMMENDED BY NATIONAL MOM, MO SEONG-AE

759
00:54:08,187 --> 00:54:10,606
I'm sorry. We'll come back next time.

760
00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:12,900
- Let's go.
- We ate before coming here.

761
00:54:12,984 --> 00:54:14,068
Sorry.

762
00:54:19,073 --> 00:54:21,284
Do we really have to do this?

763
00:54:21,367 --> 00:54:22,702
It's our job.

764
00:54:22,785 --> 00:54:24,412
Just do as you're told.

765
00:54:24,912 --> 00:54:26,330
That's what the junior members do.

766
00:54:26,872 --> 00:54:27,873
I'm going to go rest,

767
00:54:27,957 --> 00:54:31,669
so you better call
every single number on this list.

768
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:33,838
Yes, sir.

769
00:54:55,443 --> 00:54:58,571
Hello, this is Cheon Sa-rang
from King Hotel.

770
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:00,323
How have you been?

771
00:55:01,282 --> 00:55:04,201
I'm just checking in
because I haven't seen you in a while.

772
00:55:04,785 --> 00:55:05,828
No, not at all.

773
00:55:06,579 --> 00:55:09,832
I should thank you
for always saying such lovely things.

774
00:55:09,915 --> 00:55:12,501
All right then.
Please stop by when you get a chance.

775
00:55:13,085 --> 00:55:14,503
Thank you.

776
00:55:18,257 --> 00:55:21,177
Hello, this is Cheon Sa-rang
from King Hotel.

777
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:22,345
It's been a while.

778
00:55:22,428 --> 00:55:23,429
Hello.

779
00:55:23,512 --> 00:55:25,139
Good afternoon.

780
00:55:25,222 --> 00:55:26,640
This is Cheon Sa-rang from King Hotel.

781
00:55:27,224 --> 00:55:30,519
I'm just checking in
to ask you to stop by sometime.

782
00:55:32,104 --> 00:55:34,357
All right. I'll see you next time.

783
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,524
Thank you.

784
00:55:42,907 --> 00:55:43,866
Hello, sir.

785
00:55:43,949 --> 00:55:45,159
What are you doing?

786
00:55:45,868 --> 00:55:48,245
- Sorry?
- Who were you calling?

787
00:55:50,206 --> 00:55:52,583
I was calling VIP guests
to check in on them.

788
00:55:52,666 --> 00:55:54,752
You went out of your way
to call them yourself?

789
00:55:55,878 --> 00:55:57,463
Is this because of the incentive?

790
00:55:58,089 --> 00:55:59,382
It's just some extra money.

791
00:56:00,758 --> 00:56:02,385
I was just following orders

792
00:56:02,468 --> 00:56:04,804
to manage the VIP guests
in order to increase sales.

793
00:56:04,887 --> 00:56:06,972
What orders? Who ordered you to do that?

794
00:56:07,807 --> 00:56:08,766
And even so,

795
00:56:09,475 --> 00:56:10,851
shouldn't you keep your dignity intact?

796
00:56:11,977 --> 00:56:13,979
I could ask you the same thing.

797
00:56:14,063 --> 00:56:16,065
As the person in charge,
you could've helped

798
00:56:16,148 --> 00:56:17,983
instead of insulting me for working hard.

799
00:56:18,067 --> 00:56:20,820
Watching you suck up to people like this

800
00:56:20,903 --> 00:56:22,279
is even more insulting.

801
00:56:24,365 --> 00:56:26,117
I'm not sucking up to them.

802
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,701
I'm just doing my job.

803
00:56:27,785 --> 00:56:28,619
Your job?

804
00:56:30,538 --> 00:56:32,039
You're in the operations team.

805
00:56:32,623 --> 00:56:35,251
How commendable of you
to help out with sales too.

806
00:56:47,179 --> 00:56:50,683
HEAD MANAGER GU WON

807
00:56:53,769 --> 00:56:54,603
Mr. Gu?

808
00:56:56,730 --> 00:56:58,816
Do all employees do their job like that?

809
00:56:59,483 --> 00:57:00,401
What do you mean?

810
00:57:00,484 --> 00:57:02,153
Calling guests one by one

811
00:57:02,236 --> 00:57:03,821
and laughing on the phone, saying,

812
00:57:03,904 --> 00:57:05,906
"Please stop by, sir."

813
00:57:07,283 --> 00:57:08,534
How outrageous.

814
00:57:08,617 --> 00:57:09,994
They work that hard?

815
00:57:11,078 --> 00:57:13,164
I guess the big bonus
was a good incentive.

816
00:57:13,247 --> 00:57:14,874
How do you call that working?

817
00:57:16,959 --> 00:57:18,502
Was it Super Farmer Week?

818
00:57:19,378 --> 00:57:20,546
Send the employees.

819
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:22,715
I thought you weren't going to.

820
00:57:22,798 --> 00:57:25,134
It seems I was a villain, not a hero.

821
00:57:25,843 --> 00:57:28,596
I should help seeing how
they all just want to make money.

822
00:57:29,638 --> 00:57:30,473
You can proceed.

823
00:57:30,556 --> 00:57:32,308
Good thinking, sir.

824
00:57:32,892 --> 00:57:34,185
Losing is winning.

825
00:57:34,769 --> 00:57:37,021
If you continue to listen to me,

826
00:57:37,104 --> 00:57:38,856
everything will be as easy as pie.

827
00:57:38,939 --> 00:57:39,940
Like this.

828
00:57:43,652 --> 00:57:44,695
I shall proceed.

829
00:57:50,659 --> 00:57:52,036
That annoying mouth of his…

830
00:57:52,119 --> 00:57:53,120
Attention, everyone.

831
00:57:55,498 --> 00:57:57,082
It has been decided

832
00:57:57,166 --> 00:57:59,043
that we'll be attending Super Farmer Week.

833
00:58:01,462 --> 00:58:03,756
- Pardon?
- I thought we weren't going to this year.

834
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:05,257
He must've approved in the end.

835
00:58:05,841 --> 00:58:07,843
Since it's been decided,
let's make it quick.

836
00:58:07,927 --> 00:58:10,429
Discuss the locations
among yourselves and let me know.

837
00:58:10,513 --> 00:58:12,348
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

838
00:58:12,431 --> 00:58:13,307
Hang in there!

839
00:58:13,933 --> 00:58:15,100
- Yes, ma'am!
- Yes, ma'am!

840
00:58:23,526 --> 00:58:25,778
He acted like he cared in front of us.

841
00:58:26,695 --> 00:58:28,072
Was it all an act?

842
00:58:28,155 --> 00:58:31,033
I knew it. He looks like the type
to stab people in the back.

843
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:34,161
A person's face
says everything about their character.

844
00:58:34,662 --> 00:58:36,288
There's nothing we can do about it.

845
00:58:36,914 --> 00:58:37,998
Let's get ready.

846
00:58:51,887 --> 00:58:53,764
I'll pick first.

847
00:58:53,848 --> 00:58:54,932
Any objections?

848
00:59:01,188 --> 00:59:02,773
I didn't get to pick.

849
00:59:04,066 --> 00:59:05,901
You have no choice.

850
00:59:05,985 --> 00:59:06,944
You're ginseng.

851
00:59:08,028 --> 00:59:08,904
Ginseng?

852
00:59:08,988 --> 00:59:12,825
It's the most important location,
so make sure to dress nicely.

853
00:59:12,908 --> 00:59:16,161
You have to give him
the present in person.

854
00:59:16,245 --> 00:59:17,913
Take a change of clothes with you.

855
00:59:18,998 --> 00:59:20,207
All right.

856
00:59:24,128 --> 00:59:26,881
The Super Farmer Week schedule is set.

857
00:59:26,964 --> 00:59:29,717
Royal walnuts and dried black persimmon
will leave on Wednesday.

858
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:33,596
Tongyeong oysters, Wando abalones,
and wild ginseng left today.

859
00:59:33,679 --> 00:59:34,763
Already?

860
00:59:34,847 --> 00:59:36,640
They're late because you took so long.

861
00:59:39,101 --> 00:59:40,853
SUPER FARMER WEEK SCHEDULE

862
00:59:42,688 --> 00:59:45,316
MOUNT JIRI, CHEON SA-RANG

863
01:00:00,247 --> 01:00:01,790
<i>This is absurd.</i>

864
01:00:02,458 --> 01:00:04,376
She has to take the night bus from Seoul

865
01:00:04,877 --> 01:00:06,545
and arrive in Gurye at 4:40 a.m.

866
01:00:07,171 --> 01:00:10,466
From there, she needs to ride the bus
for another hour and 20 minutes

867
01:00:10,549 --> 01:00:12,843
to get to the house
of the master ginseng digger at 7 a.m.

868
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:14,428
She has to greet them,

869
01:00:14,511 --> 01:00:16,889
do house chores,
take promotional pictures,

870
01:00:16,972 --> 01:00:19,141
ride the last bus
and arrive in Seoul at 1 a.m.,

871
01:00:19,224 --> 01:00:20,809
- then come to work in the morning?
- Yes.

872
01:00:20,893 --> 01:00:23,395
She has to go all the way there
and come back in a day

873
01:00:23,479 --> 01:00:24,897
without getting any sleep?

874
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:26,440
She can sleep on the bus.

875
01:00:26,523 --> 01:00:28,859
What's so great about this event

876
01:00:28,943 --> 01:00:30,653
to work people to the bone?

877
01:00:31,362 --> 01:00:32,905
You're the one who approved it.

878
01:00:35,032 --> 01:00:36,992
They'll be getting paid 200,000 won,

879
01:00:37,076 --> 01:00:38,994
so no one's going to complain.

880
01:00:56,095 --> 01:00:59,640
WILD GINSENG

881
01:01:03,435 --> 01:01:04,812
It looks like bellflower root.

882
01:01:12,945 --> 01:01:15,280
<i>Have a safe trip.</i>

883
01:01:24,164 --> 01:01:25,791
<i>Take a day off if you need to.</i>

884
01:01:30,587 --> 01:01:33,007
<i>Are you on your way there?</i>

885
01:01:38,846 --> 01:01:41,849
Why do you keep erasing what you typed?

886
01:01:42,349 --> 01:01:45,144
If you're that worried, just call her.

887
01:01:45,728 --> 01:01:47,021
What?

888
01:01:47,104 --> 01:01:48,439
What are you talking about?

889
01:01:48,522 --> 01:01:50,315
I'm not texting anyone right now.

890
01:01:50,399 --> 01:01:52,526
I know. So you should just call her.

891
01:01:54,695 --> 01:01:55,904
Just focus on driving.

892
01:01:56,488 --> 01:01:57,656
That's what I'm doing.

893
01:01:58,782 --> 01:01:59,867
Where's the honorific?

894
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:00,951
I'll make a left, sir.

895
01:02:23,807 --> 01:02:24,892
Is anyone home?

896
01:02:29,063 --> 01:02:30,355
Can I help you?

897
01:02:32,566 --> 01:02:33,567
Goodness.

898
01:02:34,401 --> 01:02:37,362
Hello, I'm here from King Hotel.

899
01:02:37,446 --> 01:02:38,614
I see.

900
01:02:39,448 --> 01:02:40,824
The old man's not here.

901
01:02:40,908 --> 01:02:42,618
Here. I'll give it to him.

902
01:02:42,701 --> 01:02:44,161
I have to give it to him myself.

903
01:02:44,787 --> 01:02:45,913
There's no point.

904
01:02:46,497 --> 01:02:49,500
You won't be able to
get around to him with this stuff.

905
01:02:52,544 --> 01:02:55,422
We've had hotel employees
from the entire nation come visit us.

906
01:02:55,506 --> 01:02:56,507
But what's the point?

907
01:02:56,590 --> 01:03:00,969
My old man refuses to meet anyone
to remain loyal to First Royal Hotel.

908
01:03:02,054 --> 01:03:03,806
I'll put in a good word for you.

909
01:03:03,889 --> 01:03:06,308
Rest here for a bit,
then head back to Seoul.

910
01:03:06,391 --> 01:03:07,518
No, it's okay.

911
01:03:07,601 --> 01:03:09,978
Do you happen to know
where your husband is?

912
01:03:10,062 --> 01:03:11,355
He's in the mountains.

913
01:03:11,438 --> 01:03:14,483
Once he goes up there,
I never know when he'll come back.

914
01:03:15,192 --> 01:03:18,529
I'd still like to meet him and say hello.

915
01:03:19,988 --> 01:03:21,448
You're pretty stubborn.

916
01:03:22,241 --> 01:03:24,034
Then are you willing to hike?

917
01:03:24,618 --> 01:03:25,452
Which way do I go?

918
01:03:26,245 --> 01:03:30,290
If you go straight up that path,
you'll see a small shack.

919
01:03:30,374 --> 01:03:32,459
You'll be able to find him
anywhere near there.

920
01:03:35,003 --> 01:03:37,506
Then how long of a walk is it?

921
01:03:38,090 --> 01:03:39,133
It's super close.

922
01:03:39,633 --> 01:03:41,593
But are you going in those shoes?

923
01:03:41,677 --> 01:03:43,887
No, I brought another pair.
Everything's in here.

924
01:03:44,596 --> 01:03:47,057
- You can get changed in there.
- Thank you.

925
01:04:18,088 --> 01:04:19,298
She said it was close.

926
01:04:19,882 --> 01:04:21,842
I've been hiking for two hours.
Where is he?

927
01:04:23,927 --> 01:04:26,221
WEATHER MAP

928
01:04:30,392 --> 01:04:32,644
- Is it going to rain today?
- The forecast says so.

929
01:04:33,145 --> 01:04:35,022
But mountain and seaside weather
is so unpredictable.

930
01:04:35,105 --> 01:04:37,774
It says severe thunderstorms
and strong gusts of wind.

931
01:04:38,609 --> 01:04:40,235
Aren't the mountains too dangerous?

932
01:04:41,486 --> 01:04:45,032
It's funny how you're worried
when you're the one who sent her there.

933
01:04:45,115 --> 01:04:46,617
Who's worried?

934
01:04:47,284 --> 01:04:48,660
If not, never mind.

935
01:04:49,244 --> 01:04:51,121
I'm looking at today's sales trends.

936
01:04:51,205 --> 01:04:53,457
- You don't need to see it, do you?
- No, I don't.

937
01:04:53,540 --> 01:04:55,959
There's a government policy seminar.
You won't attend, right?

938
01:04:56,043 --> 01:04:57,127
No, I won't.

939
01:04:57,211 --> 01:04:59,087
You're worried sick
about Ms. Sa-rang, right?

940
01:04:59,171 --> 01:05:00,255
Of course I am.

941
01:05:02,382 --> 01:05:04,051
- What?
- You're so into her.

942
01:05:05,302 --> 01:05:08,639
You should be treating her nicely.
Why are you so testy around her?

943
01:05:08,722 --> 01:05:10,682
I don't like her.

944
01:05:10,766 --> 01:05:12,184
You're giving me a headache. Get out.

945
01:05:18,232 --> 01:05:19,107
By the way,

946
01:05:19,191 --> 01:05:21,693
there's only a 30% chance of rain today.

947
01:05:21,777 --> 01:05:24,279
So please stop worrying for no reason.

948
01:05:37,459 --> 01:05:38,502
Gosh. What the…

949
01:05:39,378 --> 01:05:40,462
What?

950
01:05:41,546 --> 01:05:42,381
Darn it.

951
01:05:43,882 --> 01:05:44,841
What the heck?

952
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:47,761
What now?

953
01:05:53,225 --> 01:05:54,935
HEAD MANAGER GU

954
01:05:55,978 --> 01:05:57,312
Yes, Mr. Gu.

955
01:05:57,396 --> 01:05:59,606
Don't get me wrong.
I'm just checking in as your manager.

956
01:06:00,607 --> 01:06:02,693
- Where are you?
- In the mountains.

957
01:06:05,862 --> 01:06:06,989
It's not raining, is it?

958
01:06:07,072 --> 01:06:08,240
Oh, gosh!

959
01:06:11,743 --> 01:06:12,786
It is raining.

960
01:06:14,746 --> 01:06:15,706
Hike back down.

961
01:06:17,499 --> 01:06:19,751
I will after giving him
the gift in person.

962
01:06:19,835 --> 01:06:21,420
Get down right now.

963
01:06:21,503 --> 01:06:23,046
Why did you go up there when it's raining?

964
01:06:23,130 --> 01:06:24,631
<i>Are you out of your mind?</i>

965
01:06:25,424 --> 01:06:27,384
You're the one who sent me here.

966
01:06:29,636 --> 01:06:31,513
I'll head back after I finish.

967
01:06:31,596 --> 01:06:33,807
<i>I don't care
about the ginseng or whatever.</i>

968
01:06:33,890 --> 01:06:35,100
<i>Just get down from there.</i>

969
01:06:37,561 --> 01:06:38,395
Hang on.

970
01:06:38,979 --> 01:06:40,063
<i>What is it?</i>

971
01:06:40,897 --> 01:06:41,982
Hold on a second.

972
01:06:42,566 --> 01:06:43,608
<i>What is it?</i>

973
01:06:44,234 --> 01:06:45,152
<i>What's going on?</i>

974
01:06:47,946 --> 01:06:48,864
My goodness! Wait.

975
01:06:56,246 --> 01:06:57,664
HEAD MANAGER GU

976
01:07:10,761 --> 01:07:11,762
No way.

977
01:07:25,025 --> 01:07:27,944
HEAD MANAGER GU

978
01:07:47,005 --> 01:07:49,466
HEAD MANAGER GU

979
01:08:19,454 --> 01:08:20,622
Am I alive?

980
01:08:23,291 --> 01:08:25,127
Oh no.

981
01:08:25,210 --> 01:08:26,336
What do I do?

982
01:08:29,798 --> 01:08:30,841
Hello?

983
01:08:31,425 --> 01:08:32,843
Is anyone there?

984
01:08:33,969 --> 01:08:36,346
There's a person down here. Please help!

985
01:08:40,517 --> 01:08:41,560
Oh no.

986
01:08:50,068 --> 01:08:52,279
I'll either starve or freeze to death.

987
01:08:54,573 --> 01:08:56,950
Is this it for me?

988
01:09:09,963 --> 01:09:12,466
They say you'll look good in the afterlife
if you ate well in life.

989
01:09:13,049 --> 01:09:14,843
I can't tell if this is ginseng or not.

990
01:09:36,364 --> 01:09:37,407
What was that?

991
01:09:38,408 --> 01:09:39,534
I'm scared.

992
01:09:40,827 --> 01:09:42,245
Am I going to die?

993
01:09:47,083 --> 01:09:48,335
What do I do?

994
01:09:49,211 --> 01:09:51,796
I'm scared, Grandma.

995
01:10:57,654 --> 01:11:00,657
KING THE LAND

996
01:11:34,190 --> 01:11:35,025
<i>Thank you.</i>

997
01:11:35,108 --> 01:11:36,192
<i>It was me!</i>

998
01:11:36,276 --> 01:11:37,652
<i>I saved her!</i>

999
01:11:37,736 --> 01:11:39,362
Why should you two eat when I saved her?

1000
01:11:40,155 --> 01:11:41,531
<i>Follow me.</i>

1001
01:11:41,615 --> 01:11:43,450
- You've peeled onions before, right?
- Me?

1002
01:11:43,533 --> 01:11:44,993
<i>Just do as I say.</i>

1003
01:11:45,702 --> 01:11:47,162
<i>My gosh! What are you doing there?</i>

1004
01:11:47,245 --> 01:11:48,830
<i>It's me, Gu Won.</i>

1005
01:11:48,913 --> 01:11:49,789
Help.

1006
01:11:49,873 --> 01:11:53,668
You're too old
to be living off your father.

1007
01:11:53,752 --> 01:11:55,378
Do you have
a housing subscription account?

1008
01:11:56,838 --> 01:11:57,881
<i>Are you hurt?</i>

1009
01:11:57,964 --> 01:11:59,132
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1010
01:11:59,215 --> 01:12:00,175
<i>I said I'd protect you.</i>

1011
01:12:03,595 --> 01:12:04,638
<i>I'll let you take me.</i>

1012
01:12:06,222 --> 01:12:07,265
<i>It's a date.</i>

1013
