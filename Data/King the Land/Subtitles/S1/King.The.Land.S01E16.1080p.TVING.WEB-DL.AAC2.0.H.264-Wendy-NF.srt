1
00:00:48,589 --> 00:00:52,036
KING THE LAND

2
00:00:52,449 --> 00:00:54,062
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:54,143 --> 00:00:55,882
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:57,177 --> 00:00:58,595
<i>Are you not going to tell me?</i>

5
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:01,056
Do you want to see me die of frustration?

6
00:01:04,935 --> 00:01:06,186
It's just…

7
00:01:07,437 --> 00:01:09,481
I have a lot on my mind.

8
00:01:10,774 --> 00:01:12,609
I'm wondering if the work I'm doing now

9
00:01:14,236 --> 00:01:17,572
is what I really wanted to do at a hotel.

10
00:01:21,952 --> 00:01:24,246
This isn't what I dreamed of.

11
00:01:32,045 --> 00:01:33,130
I know.

12
00:01:33,213 --> 00:01:36,675
I should be thankful for my job there
instead of complaining.

13
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,514
Goodness.

14
00:01:43,432 --> 00:01:48,061
My baby has finally learned
to grumble and whine.

15
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,647
I always wondered

16
00:01:50,731 --> 00:01:53,817
if I'd be able to see you do this
before I passed away.

17
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,742
What are you saying?

18
00:02:02,326 --> 00:02:03,910
You should be telling me off,

19
00:02:03,994 --> 00:02:06,830
saying that I can't have it all
and to just do my job.

20
00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:10,167
No matter how well-known a restaurant is,

21
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,669
it's no use if it's not to your liking.

22
00:02:12,753 --> 00:02:14,171
Who cares about the hotel?

23
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,049
You only live once.

24
00:02:17,758 --> 00:02:19,801
You should do what you really want to do.

25
00:02:20,302 --> 00:02:22,554
Don't mind other people,

26
00:02:22,637 --> 00:02:24,222
and don't hesitate either.

27
00:02:24,306 --> 00:02:26,224
Do everything you want to.

28
00:02:26,933 --> 00:02:29,019
If it isn't the way,
you can take a detour.

29
00:02:29,102 --> 00:02:31,938
If you fall off a cliff,
you can climb up again.

30
00:02:33,607 --> 00:02:34,691
Okay?

31
00:02:40,113 --> 00:02:41,114
Okay.

32
00:02:41,698 --> 00:02:43,992
Okay, Grandma.

33
00:02:46,828 --> 00:02:48,288
You'll be fine.

34
00:02:48,372 --> 00:02:51,583
I'm here for you,
so do whatever you want to do.

35
00:02:52,876 --> 00:02:54,127
You deserve it.

36
00:02:58,298 --> 00:02:59,341
Okay.

37
00:02:59,925 --> 00:03:01,134
I'll do that.

38
00:03:01,218 --> 00:03:02,302
Good.

39
00:03:16,483 --> 00:03:17,943
I'm done.

40
00:03:19,402 --> 00:03:20,695
I want to leave.

41
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,552
What do you exactly mean…

42
00:03:47,097 --> 00:03:48,473
by leaving?

43
00:03:51,435 --> 00:03:53,186
I want to quit my job at the hotel.

44
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,777
Was there a specific reason

45
00:04:02,112 --> 00:04:03,572
that made you want to quit?

46
00:04:11,746 --> 00:04:15,792
To me, a hotel was a place of happiness.

47
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:19,254
And that's why I became a concierge.

48
00:04:20,547 --> 00:04:22,883
I wanted to provide the happiest day

49
00:04:22,966 --> 00:04:25,760
to every guest who stayed at the hotel.

50
00:04:26,761 --> 00:04:29,556
But what I'm doing right now
seems far from that.

51
00:04:30,557 --> 00:04:33,059
Although King the Land may be fancy,

52
00:04:33,143 --> 00:04:35,312
and I may make a lot of money
in the Dream Team,

53
00:04:36,438 --> 00:04:38,356
it's not the life I want.

54
00:04:40,025 --> 00:04:41,109
I also…

55
00:04:43,028 --> 00:04:45,322
want to write my own story.

56
00:04:59,794 --> 00:05:01,588
It sounded like a tough decision,

57
00:05:04,216 --> 00:05:05,800
but it was a happy resolution.

58
00:05:08,136 --> 00:05:09,137
That's true.

59
00:05:11,348 --> 00:05:14,518
I want to make a hotel of my own,
no matter how tiny it is.

60
00:05:15,477 --> 00:05:16,937
I want to try it on my own.

61
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:25,445
One second.

62
00:05:29,491 --> 00:05:30,742
It's me.

63
00:05:30,825 --> 00:05:32,244
Please cancel the event.

64
00:05:32,869 --> 00:05:33,954
Thank you.

65
00:05:36,665 --> 00:05:38,166
What did you just cancel?

66
00:05:40,293 --> 00:05:42,003
It was something important.

67
00:05:46,132 --> 00:05:47,175
But I'll do it later.

68
00:05:53,682 --> 00:05:54,891
I'm sorry.

69
00:05:54,975 --> 00:05:56,184
I must've startled you.

70
00:05:56,685 --> 00:05:57,519
Don't be.

71
00:06:01,231 --> 00:06:02,232
Congratulations.

72
00:06:03,233 --> 00:06:05,360
You found what you really wanted to do,

73
00:06:06,194 --> 00:06:07,779
and you're determined to try it.

74
00:06:08,363 --> 00:06:09,823
Congratulations.

75
00:06:09,906 --> 00:06:15,745
Perhaps that was
what I most wanted to hear from you.

76
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:18,331
Thank you

77
00:06:18,957 --> 00:06:20,292
for sharing

78
00:06:21,584 --> 00:06:23,044
your honest feelings.

79
00:06:26,923 --> 00:06:28,174
But promise me one thing.

80
00:06:29,884 --> 00:06:30,844
What is it?

81
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,346
When you work alone,

82
00:06:35,098 --> 00:06:37,350
you'll face many difficulties.

83
00:06:38,351 --> 00:06:42,355
You'll come across things
that are tough for you to bear alone.

84
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:44,399
When that happens, don't hesitate…

85
00:06:46,985 --> 00:06:48,153
and call me.

86
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:50,989
I'll run over right away.

87
00:07:12,802 --> 00:07:15,430
You're the prettiest today
since the day we first met.

88
00:07:15,513 --> 00:07:16,806
You're dazzling.

89
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:20,101
I was going to blow my nose,
but I can't now that you said that.

90
00:07:20,935 --> 00:07:22,312
Just blow your nose.

91
00:07:22,395 --> 00:07:23,897
Even that looks pretty to me.

92
00:07:26,566 --> 00:07:28,360
So what did you want to say to me?

93
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,029
Oh.

94
00:07:37,702 --> 00:07:38,912
No matter where you are,

95
00:07:40,372 --> 00:07:42,040
no matter what you do,

96
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,003
I'll always be on your side.

97
00:07:50,173 --> 00:07:51,841
I wanted to tell you that.

98
00:07:59,432 --> 00:08:00,725
Thank you.

99
00:08:02,435 --> 00:08:03,353
Me too.

100
00:08:05,313 --> 00:08:06,856
I'll always be on your side.

101
00:08:09,484 --> 00:08:10,610
Excuse me.

102
00:08:10,694 --> 00:08:12,195
May I take a photo of you two?

103
00:08:13,113 --> 00:08:14,030
Sure.

104
00:08:16,366 --> 00:08:17,367
You look great.

105
00:08:18,201 --> 00:08:20,245
I'll take the photo now.

106
00:08:20,328 --> 00:08:22,622
One, two, three.

107
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,333
Could you take one more?

108
00:08:32,132 --> 00:08:33,550
Okay, one more time.

109
00:08:34,217 --> 00:08:36,970
One, two, three.

110
00:08:41,141 --> 00:08:43,435
FINALE

111
00:09:15,842 --> 00:09:17,802
Thank you for seeing me today.

112
00:09:18,678 --> 00:09:22,015
How could I turn down your offer
to treat me to a meal?

113
00:09:22,724 --> 00:09:25,977
Are you trying to
kill your enemy with kindness?

114
00:09:27,395 --> 00:09:28,855
I wanted to tell you something.

115
00:09:30,565 --> 00:09:33,109
Yes, I'm sure you have lots to say.

116
00:09:34,486 --> 00:09:35,361
I'm listening.

117
00:09:38,406 --> 00:09:39,240
Well…

118
00:09:43,036 --> 00:09:44,370
I would like to quit.

119
00:09:45,205 --> 00:09:46,831
I came to tell you that.

120
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,586
May I ask

121
00:09:52,712 --> 00:09:53,838
the reason?

122
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:56,007
I want to quit

123
00:09:57,091 --> 00:09:58,927
and date him out in the open.

124
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,970
If I stay here,

125
00:10:01,054 --> 00:10:03,181
I'd have to continue
following your orders.

126
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,435
Did you come to declare war?

127
00:10:09,562 --> 00:10:13,107
I came to a realization
after spending time away from him.

128
00:10:13,858 --> 00:10:15,735
I love him so much

129
00:10:15,819 --> 00:10:18,613
that I can't live without him.

130
00:10:23,618 --> 00:10:25,453
You may not be happy with me,

131
00:10:26,162 --> 00:10:28,706
but I know I won't disappoint you.

132
00:10:41,219 --> 00:10:43,346
This is exactly why I like you!

133
00:10:50,436 --> 00:10:51,938
I apologize for my immaturity

134
00:10:52,021 --> 00:10:54,649
and for not separating the personal
from the professional.

135
00:10:54,732 --> 00:10:56,568
When it comes to my children,

136
00:10:56,651 --> 00:10:57,986
I become rather ambitious.

137
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:01,698
It's all right. I understand.

138
00:11:02,699 --> 00:11:05,785
Thanks to you,
I reached the highest position possible

139
00:11:06,411 --> 00:11:09,205
and found out what I truly wanted.

140
00:11:10,331 --> 00:11:11,416
So thank you.

141
00:11:14,794 --> 00:11:18,131
That's why I'm going to do something
I really want to do.

142
00:11:18,214 --> 00:11:19,048
I see.

143
00:11:19,132 --> 00:11:22,093
I'm sure you'll do a great job,
no matter what it is.

144
00:11:24,095 --> 00:11:25,096
Thank you.

145
00:11:26,431 --> 00:11:29,350
It's my treat today, so please enjoy.

146
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:32,186
All right.

147
00:11:33,062 --> 00:11:34,188
Thank you.

148
00:11:35,064 --> 00:11:35,982
I'll enjoy it.

149
00:11:42,614 --> 00:11:43,865
So delicious.

150
00:11:58,588 --> 00:12:00,632
Sa-rang, thank you for your hard work.

151
00:12:01,507 --> 00:12:03,760
This is for you. It's from all of us.

152
00:12:06,304 --> 00:12:07,263
Thank you.

153
00:12:08,431 --> 00:12:10,433
I learned so much from everyone.

154
00:12:10,516 --> 00:12:12,894
Don't forget us no matter where you go.

155
00:12:12,977 --> 00:12:14,479
I hope you'll always be happy.

156
00:12:17,523 --> 00:12:19,442
Thank you, everyone.

157
00:12:20,276 --> 00:12:21,486
I'll miss you all.

158
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,241
And Ms. Jeon,

159
00:12:28,368 --> 00:12:30,870
you always helped me greatly.

160
00:12:31,788 --> 00:12:33,456
I'll never forget that.

161
00:12:39,253 --> 00:12:40,546
You've done well.

162
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,427
I want to hug her too.

163
00:12:46,511 --> 00:12:47,553
Me too.

164
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:51,474
- Sa-rang.
- Don't go.

165
00:12:51,557 --> 00:12:52,725
- Great work.
- Gosh.

166
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:54,102
You'll stay in touch, right?

167
00:12:54,185 --> 00:12:56,104
- Yes.
- Don't forget us.

168
00:13:19,836 --> 00:13:21,671
"President Gu Won."

169
00:13:28,052 --> 00:13:29,137
Sa-rang.

170
00:13:30,847 --> 00:13:33,099
- Hello.
- It's your last day.

171
00:13:33,683 --> 00:13:34,809
It is.

172
00:13:34,892 --> 00:13:36,436
Mr. Gu went out to work.

173
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:37,520
It's okay.

174
00:13:38,104 --> 00:13:40,523
Anyway, with our kind Ms. Sa-rang gone,

175
00:13:40,606 --> 00:13:42,275
who will watch over King Hotel?

176
00:13:42,984 --> 00:13:45,528
The talented Mr. No is here,
so why are you worried?

177
00:13:45,611 --> 00:13:46,988
That's true, right?

178
00:13:47,905 --> 00:13:49,365
But with you gone,

179
00:13:49,449 --> 00:13:51,576
my life will be too tiresome.

180
00:13:52,243 --> 00:13:53,828
I must deal with his temper alone.

181
00:13:53,911 --> 00:13:55,371
Don't say that.

182
00:13:55,913 --> 00:13:58,791
He's very considerate of you.
Please take good care of him.

183
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,419
So he said that behind my back?

184
00:14:02,587 --> 00:14:04,547
We should all get together soon
for a drink.

185
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,840
Okay, let's meet up.

186
00:14:05,923 --> 00:14:06,883
Sounds good.

187
00:14:09,802 --> 00:14:10,970
Good work.

188
00:14:16,642 --> 00:14:17,977
Thank you.

189
00:14:19,937 --> 00:14:21,105
I'll root for you.

190
00:14:25,234 --> 00:14:26,527
Wait, why are you crying?

191
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:28,571
I am?

192
00:14:28,654 --> 00:14:29,822
- Come on.
- I'll leave.

193
00:14:29,906 --> 00:14:31,741
- What's with you?
- Are you staying? Bye.

194
00:14:31,824 --> 00:14:33,659
CHEON SA-RANG

195
00:15:04,607 --> 00:15:05,817
CHEON SA-RANG

196
00:16:33,863 --> 00:16:36,157
Wait, how did you find me here?

197
00:16:37,909 --> 00:16:39,202
Congrats on your new chapter.

198
00:16:43,956 --> 00:16:44,999
Thank you.

199
00:16:45,082 --> 00:16:46,167
One second.

200
00:16:53,257 --> 00:16:54,675
They say good shoes

201
00:16:55,593 --> 00:16:57,303
take you to good places.

202
00:17:17,281 --> 00:17:18,366
They're so pretty.

203
00:17:19,867 --> 00:17:20,910
Thank you

204
00:17:22,286 --> 00:17:24,163
for all of your hard work…

205
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,709
at King Hotel.

206
00:17:33,965 --> 00:17:36,509
I get to leave with great memories
thanks to you.

207
00:17:37,385 --> 00:17:38,761
Thank you.

208
00:17:39,428 --> 00:17:40,554
Good work,

209
00:17:41,806 --> 00:17:45,017
our number one best talent.

210
00:17:47,144 --> 00:17:48,312
I was happy here,

211
00:17:49,146 --> 00:17:50,606
President Gu Won.

212
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:52,149
You're always welcome to visit.

213
00:17:52,233 --> 00:17:54,151
We'll have you as our VVIP guest.

214
00:17:54,235 --> 00:17:55,278
It's an honor.

215
00:17:55,361 --> 00:17:57,446
Please make me the VVVVVVIP.

216
00:17:58,072 --> 00:17:58,948
Of course.

217
00:18:00,574 --> 00:18:01,993
- Shall we?
- Okay.

218
00:18:03,953 --> 00:18:05,621
<i>- Can you give me 1,000 won?
- What?</i>

219
00:18:05,705 --> 00:18:08,249
I hear I need to get money
after giving shoes as a gift.

220
00:18:08,332 --> 00:18:09,792
Only then will you not run away.

221
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,837
You're right. You knew that?

222
00:18:13,713 --> 00:18:15,256
I can give you 1,000 won.

223
00:18:16,215 --> 00:18:17,258
Wait, my wallet!

224
00:18:17,341 --> 00:18:19,593
- Where is it?
- We left everything at the bus stop.

225
00:18:19,677 --> 00:18:20,594
Sir, stop the car!

226
00:18:42,433 --> 00:18:45,102
These chores never end.

227
00:18:46,311 --> 00:18:48,397
I'll end up developing hand eczema.

228
00:18:51,233 --> 00:18:53,610
- Put these on.
- Are you a wolf in sheep's clothing?

229
00:18:54,987 --> 00:18:55,988
Thanks a lot.

230
00:18:56,071 --> 00:18:58,407
I'm about to cry tears of gratitude.

231
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:01,493
If you have to do it anyway,
try to enjoy it.

232
00:19:01,577 --> 00:19:02,953
But this isn't enjoyable!

233
00:19:03,036 --> 00:19:05,414
I have no pleasure in life,
stuck at home all day!

234
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:09,460
It's your day off. You're leaving?

235
00:19:10,169 --> 00:19:11,420
I signed up for a workout.

236
00:19:11,503 --> 00:19:14,089
What? Are you out of your mind?

237
00:19:14,673 --> 00:19:17,176
You need to help me out at home
on your day off!

238
00:19:17,259 --> 00:19:19,011
Get a job within the month,

239
00:19:19,094 --> 00:19:20,971
or I'm really done with you.

240
00:19:21,513 --> 00:19:23,682
Do the dishes and clean the bathroom too.

241
00:19:23,765 --> 00:19:26,185
Why am I the only one who has to do this?

242
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,238
Don't worry and go, Mom.

243
00:19:38,322 --> 00:19:39,615
I'll keep my eyes on him.

244
00:19:39,698 --> 00:19:41,074
Cho-rong, what's this?

245
00:19:41,158 --> 00:19:42,326
An army drill sergeant.

246
00:19:42,409 --> 00:19:44,119
These guys are the scariest.

247
00:19:45,871 --> 00:19:46,914
You've got ten minutes.

248
00:19:46,997 --> 00:19:48,874
Finish up in ten minutes. Understood?

249
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,835
No, I don't understand.

250
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,795
Then bunny hop until you get it!

251
00:19:53,879 --> 00:19:55,839
Great job, Cho-rong.

252
00:19:56,715 --> 00:19:58,550
Keep an eye on him. I'll be quick.

253
00:19:58,634 --> 00:20:00,260
Okay, be careful of the traffic.

254
00:20:00,344 --> 00:20:01,845
Yes, ma'am!

255
00:20:23,951 --> 00:20:24,826
Thank you.

256
00:20:27,412 --> 00:20:28,247
Please.

257
00:20:34,545 --> 00:20:35,629
What do you think?

258
00:20:35,712 --> 00:20:38,882
It does smell quite different.

259
00:20:38,966 --> 00:20:40,467
It tastes completely different.

260
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,387
We know that too,

261
00:20:44,304 --> 00:20:46,223
but I don't think it's necessary

262
00:20:46,306 --> 00:20:49,560
to place premium coffee machines
used in junior suites and higher

263
00:20:49,643 --> 00:20:51,103
in standard rooms as well.

264
00:20:51,186 --> 00:20:52,437
I agree.

265
00:20:52,521 --> 00:20:55,065
It blurs the service differentiation
between room types.

266
00:20:56,233 --> 00:21:00,153
The standard room
is our most popular unit, right?

267
00:21:01,113 --> 00:21:03,740
- Yes.
- Do you think it's a waste

268
00:21:03,824 --> 00:21:06,535
to provide better coffee and services

269
00:21:06,618 --> 00:21:07,995
to the majority of our guests?

270
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,541
They won't notice.
Is this change necessary?

271
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:15,794
It all tastes the same.

272
00:21:19,298 --> 00:21:22,718
These small changes are what set us apart.

273
00:21:23,427 --> 00:21:25,429
Our hotel has a simple principle.

274
00:21:25,512 --> 00:21:27,556
Regardless of the room they're staying in,

275
00:21:28,307 --> 00:21:31,518
we consider every single guest
at our hotel a VIP.

276
00:21:31,602 --> 00:21:35,188
That is our new principle.

277
00:21:39,109 --> 00:21:40,068
Well then.

278
00:21:41,445 --> 00:21:44,156
Then we'll change the water too.

279
00:21:44,239 --> 00:21:45,198
Thank you.

280
00:21:46,408 --> 00:21:48,660
May we move on to the next item?

281
00:21:48,744 --> 00:21:49,578
Yes.

282
00:21:50,621 --> 00:21:51,663
The next item

283
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:54,833
is breaking into the European market.

284
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,629
According to market research,
tourists have increased,

285
00:21:58,712 --> 00:22:01,798
but the revenues of global hotel chains
continue to drop.

286
00:22:01,882 --> 00:22:05,344
The needs of guests continue to grow
more detailed and diverse.

287
00:22:05,427 --> 00:22:10,015
We won't break into the market
as a large-scale hotel chain.

288
00:22:10,098 --> 00:22:13,769
Focus on purchasing luxury mansions
that can accommodate up to 20 rooms.

289
00:22:13,852 --> 00:22:17,022
A single chain with a thousand styles.

290
00:22:18,106 --> 00:22:21,234
That's our strategy
for the European market.

291
00:22:24,196 --> 00:22:26,406
So this will turn into our staff lounge?

292
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:28,450
I'm telling you. Why won't you believe me?

293
00:22:28,533 --> 00:22:30,243
We'll really get massage chairs too?

294
00:22:30,327 --> 00:22:31,662
And a nap room too.

295
00:22:31,745 --> 00:22:32,996
No way.

296
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,624
Then we can truly relax
when we go on breaks, right?

297
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:37,626
Sure.

298
00:22:39,252 --> 00:22:41,838
It's all thanks to Mr. Gu.

299
00:22:41,922 --> 00:22:43,340
You should be grateful,

300
00:22:43,423 --> 00:22:44,800
work harder when you work,

301
00:22:44,883 --> 00:22:46,510
and rest well on breaks. Okay?

302
00:22:46,593 --> 00:22:47,636
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

303
00:22:49,554 --> 00:22:50,847
Jeez, what are you doing?

304
00:22:50,931 --> 00:22:52,891
- New cologne?
- It's what I always use.

305
00:22:52,974 --> 00:22:55,018
What's this?
Pull your arm out. You're gross.

306
00:22:55,602 --> 00:22:57,646
A new position, a new scent.

307
00:22:57,729 --> 00:22:59,022
How charming.

308
00:22:59,106 --> 00:23:02,359
When will I get promoted
to a position worthy of such a scent?

309
00:23:02,442 --> 00:23:03,402
I really wonder.

310
00:23:16,081 --> 00:23:16,915
We need to talk.

311
00:23:19,042 --> 00:23:20,919
- This is for me?
- Yes.

312
00:23:21,002 --> 00:23:23,171
- It looks bad.
- This is good.

313
00:23:23,964 --> 00:23:26,007
Why are you suddenly so nice to me?

314
00:23:26,091 --> 00:23:27,134
It doesn't suit you.

315
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,392
This actually tastes good.

316
00:23:35,475 --> 00:23:36,852
It's good.

317
00:23:41,648 --> 00:23:42,691
Is that for me?

318
00:23:44,025 --> 00:23:45,193
What could it be?

319
00:23:45,277 --> 00:23:46,403
Should I open it?

320
00:23:51,032 --> 00:23:52,576
Business cards?

321
00:23:52,659 --> 00:23:54,411
I still have lots left.

322
00:23:57,664 --> 00:23:59,332
NO SANG-SIK
STRATEGIC PLANNING DEPARTMENT MANAGER

323
00:24:03,253 --> 00:24:04,337
I'm a department manager?

324
00:24:05,046 --> 00:24:07,424
- You are.
- I'm a department manager!

325
00:24:07,507 --> 00:24:09,176
I'm a department manager!

326
00:24:13,638 --> 00:24:16,057
Are you that happy about it?

327
00:24:16,141 --> 00:24:17,642
Why am I not the head manager?

328
00:24:17,726 --> 00:24:18,602
What?

329
00:24:18,685 --> 00:24:21,146
Ms. Gu said she would make me
the head manager.

330
00:24:21,229 --> 00:24:22,981
I should have switched over then.

331
00:24:23,565 --> 00:24:24,733
I shouldn't have stayed loyal.

332
00:24:24,816 --> 00:24:25,901
There's no reward.

333
00:24:25,984 --> 00:24:27,277
This is such a shame.

334
00:24:28,236 --> 00:24:31,615
I honestly thought
you'd make me the head manager.

335
00:24:31,698 --> 00:24:32,616
You don't like

336
00:24:33,658 --> 00:24:34,826
department manager?

337
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,119
It's not that.

338
00:24:36,203 --> 00:24:38,580
It's just a bummer
that there's no head manager.

339
00:24:38,663 --> 00:24:40,832
It'd be wonderful
to change this to "head."

340
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:42,209
"Head Manager No Sang-sik."

341
00:24:45,086 --> 00:24:46,421
In that case…

342
00:24:55,055 --> 00:24:56,723
I guess you won't need this either.

343
00:24:57,516 --> 00:24:58,767
What is this?

344
00:24:59,768 --> 00:25:02,062
May I open it? I'm doing it.

345
00:25:04,898 --> 00:25:06,191
You said you didn't need it.

346
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,028
It's a watch.

347
00:25:11,613 --> 00:25:13,698
Mr. Gu, your generosity knows no bounds.

348
00:25:14,282 --> 00:25:17,035
Not only are you handsome,
but you're also charming and cool.

349
00:25:17,118 --> 00:25:19,037
That's why you're dating someone.

350
00:25:19,955 --> 00:25:21,164
You didn't want it. Give it back.

351
00:25:21,248 --> 00:25:23,542
No takebacks. You gave it to me.

352
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:24,543
- Bring it here.
- No.

353
00:25:24,626 --> 00:25:27,003
I will work here until my death.

354
00:25:27,087 --> 00:25:27,921
Thanks a lot.

355
00:25:28,004 --> 00:25:29,673
You didn't want it. Give it back.

356
00:25:29,756 --> 00:25:32,259
Thank you for the promotion!
We go hard! Let's go!

357
00:25:33,635 --> 00:25:34,678
Thanks!

358
00:25:35,512 --> 00:25:36,471
Thank you!

359
00:25:39,474 --> 00:25:41,226
It is I, Department Manager No!

360
00:25:56,866 --> 00:25:58,368
HOUSING LISTINGS

361
00:25:58,451 --> 00:25:59,703
<i>Did you find a place?</i>

362
00:25:59,786 --> 00:26:01,162
I'm still looking.

363
00:26:01,246 --> 00:26:04,374
<i>What's your theme?
Let's look it up together.</i>

364
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:06,042
That's a secret.

365
00:26:06,126 --> 00:26:07,794
Come on, don't be like that.

366
00:26:09,045 --> 00:26:10,338
I found one.

367
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,091
I'll call you back.

368
00:26:25,353 --> 00:26:28,148
Hello, I saw one of your listings online.

369
00:26:28,231 --> 00:26:29,899
May I see the building?

370
00:26:29,983 --> 00:26:34,070
Right, the listing number is 15017.

371
00:26:54,674 --> 00:26:56,843
Hello, I'm calling
about one of your listings.

372
00:27:02,766 --> 00:27:04,017
Not this one.

373
00:27:07,854 --> 00:27:09,147
I don't think this is it.

374
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,442
Not this one either.

375
00:27:14,778 --> 00:27:17,364
I'm calling about listing number 10591.

376
00:27:17,447 --> 00:27:18,531
I see.

377
00:27:18,615 --> 00:27:20,283
I wanted to see a building you have.

378
00:27:20,367 --> 00:27:21,951
All right.

379
00:27:27,916 --> 00:27:29,626
I finally found it!

380
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,254
Congratulations.

381
00:27:48,019 --> 00:27:49,938
CHEON SA-RANG

382
00:27:58,321 --> 00:28:00,615
<i>-You're opening your business
-You're opening your business</i>

383
00:28:00,699 --> 00:28:03,284
<i>-You're opening your business

384
00:28:03,368 --> 00:28:05,620

386
00:28:08,331 --> 00:28:10,625
FINALLY A BOSS

387
00:28:12,669 --> 00:28:14,629
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

388
00:28:14,713 --> 00:28:16,339
I'm so proud of you.

389
00:28:16,423 --> 00:28:18,633
There's finally a boss among us.

390
00:28:18,717 --> 00:28:20,218
An owner of a hotel, at that.

391
00:28:20,301 --> 00:28:23,304
Who cares if I'm the owner
when I'm the only staff?

392
00:28:23,388 --> 00:28:25,473
Girls like her are the scariest.

393
00:28:25,557 --> 00:28:27,392
She said she never wanted much,
but now she owns a hotel!

394
00:28:27,475 --> 00:28:30,186
I took out a huge mortgage,
and there's only one room.

395
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:32,522
And that single room is a suite.

396
00:28:32,605 --> 00:28:34,274
Of course, all rooms are suites.

397
00:28:34,357 --> 00:28:35,859
The cream of the crop.

398
00:28:37,068 --> 00:28:39,654
Thank you always
for seeing things in a better light.

399
00:28:39,738 --> 00:28:42,157
I'm so happy I'm friends with you two.

400
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,366
You two are the best!

401
00:28:44,617 --> 00:28:47,120
You realized that just now?
Of course we're the best.

402
00:28:48,121 --> 00:28:50,832
Now, let me mix some drinks.

403
00:28:50,915 --> 00:28:52,792
Sounds great. Okay.

404
00:28:52,876 --> 00:28:55,086
KETTLE-COOKED COW'S HEAD GUKBAP

405
00:28:57,047 --> 00:28:59,340
CHA SUN-HUI

406
00:29:03,344 --> 00:29:05,638
Hey, Sa-rang.

407
00:29:05,722 --> 00:29:06,848
Cheon Sa-rang?

408
00:29:06,931 --> 00:29:08,308
I'm busy, Grandma.

409
00:29:08,391 --> 00:29:09,601
Come here.

410
00:29:12,687 --> 00:29:14,731
What is it? I'm busy.

411
00:29:15,273 --> 00:29:17,358
I still have a ton of dishes left.

412
00:29:19,194 --> 00:29:20,528
Did something good happen?

413
00:29:23,448 --> 00:29:24,282
What's this?

414
00:29:24,365 --> 00:29:25,950
All of your daily wages.

415
00:29:27,285 --> 00:29:28,912
You gave me pocket money each time.

416
00:29:28,995 --> 00:29:30,371
Think of it as severance pay.

417
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,208
I wasn't even a full-time employee.

418
00:29:36,086 --> 00:29:39,089
How much is this?
One, two, three, four, five, six…

419
00:29:39,923 --> 00:29:40,757
Grandma!

420
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:44,094
Thanks for helping me out
even with your busy schedule.

421
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,722
No, I can't take this. It's yours.

422
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:50,809
And this here

423
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:54,729
is the money from selling
the wild ginseng you dug up

424
00:29:54,813 --> 00:29:56,272
from Mount Jiri or whatever.

425
00:29:57,774 --> 00:30:01,194
Why did you sell it?
I told you to have it yourself.

426
00:30:01,694 --> 00:30:02,821
Jeez.

427
00:30:07,033 --> 00:30:08,701
Wait, 150 million won?

428
00:30:08,785 --> 00:30:12,539
That little thing was
apparently over 100 years old

429
00:30:12,622 --> 00:30:14,249
and valued at over 100 million.

430
00:30:14,332 --> 00:30:15,959
I was really shocked.

431
00:30:16,042 --> 00:30:19,796
What would you have done
if I ate that precious thing?

432
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:22,632
That's why I wanted you to have it.

433
00:30:22,715 --> 00:30:25,468
Goodness, home-cooked meals
are better than wild ginseng.

434
00:30:25,552 --> 00:30:28,096
I'm perfectly healthy,
so don't worry about me.

435
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,889
And this.

436
00:30:29,973 --> 00:30:32,976
I saved up some money to give to you

437
00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:35,520
for when you found something
you really wanted to do.

438
00:30:35,603 --> 00:30:36,896
It's not much.

439
00:30:38,189 --> 00:30:40,900
Gosh, this is too much.

440
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:45,738
I saved up money too, Grandma.

441
00:30:45,822 --> 00:30:49,200
Don't let money stop you
from doing whatever you want.

442
00:30:49,284 --> 00:30:51,119
If it's a hotel,

443
00:30:51,202 --> 00:30:53,621
it should look pretty
no matter how small it is.

444
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:59,460
No matter what hotel you run,

445
00:30:59,544 --> 00:31:01,713
make something that resembles you.

446
00:31:02,297 --> 00:31:07,343
Then it'll be
the prettiest hotel in this world.

447
00:31:13,183 --> 00:31:15,059
- Thank you, Grandma.
- Sure.

448
00:31:16,561 --> 00:31:18,146
My precious girl.

449
00:31:19,063 --> 00:31:23,276
Thank you for letting me
do my part as your grandmother.

450
00:31:40,752 --> 00:31:41,794
All right.

451
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:20,792
{\an8}SUITE

452
00:32:24,337 --> 00:32:25,338
OFFICE

453
00:32:40,019 --> 00:32:41,729
You're going to the US tomorrow?

454
00:32:41,813 --> 00:32:42,981
He has an early flight.

455
00:32:44,565 --> 00:32:46,734
Why don't you come back and live here?

456
00:32:46,818 --> 00:32:48,695
It's okay, Grandpa.

457
00:32:48,778 --> 00:32:51,656
I want to go back to school
and see my friends too.

458
00:32:51,739 --> 00:32:52,949
Really?

459
00:32:53,032 --> 00:32:56,536
I thought you'd prefer living here
with Mom and Grandpa.

460
00:32:56,619 --> 00:32:59,789
That sounds great,
but I should go back to where I should be.

461
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:05,253
You're not old enough
to be acting so grown up.

462
00:33:05,336 --> 00:33:06,713
You've matured too early.

463
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:08,923
I'm sad to see you go.

464
00:33:09,007 --> 00:33:10,008
I'll be back.

465
00:33:12,343 --> 00:33:13,553
Okay. Let's eat.

466
00:33:31,237 --> 00:33:32,488
Ji-hu.

467
00:33:32,572 --> 00:33:34,741
If you want to stay, you can stay longer.

468
00:33:35,366 --> 00:33:36,784
If you don't want to go, don't.

469
00:33:37,368 --> 00:33:39,245
No, I want to go now.

470
00:33:41,664 --> 00:33:43,708
Why the sudden change of heart?

471
00:33:46,586 --> 00:33:50,256
Please say goodbye to Sa-rang for me.

472
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,425
Let's fly kites again next time,
Uncle Won.

473
00:33:56,262 --> 00:33:57,263
Okay.

474
00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:00,558
Let's hang out again
the next time you visit.

475
00:34:00,641 --> 00:34:01,684
Okay.

476
00:34:16,157 --> 00:34:17,325
We need to talk.

477
00:34:19,494 --> 00:34:20,328
Talk.

478
00:34:21,162 --> 00:34:22,330
Don't let Ji-hu…

479
00:34:23,873 --> 00:34:25,333
live like we did.

480
00:34:28,461 --> 00:34:29,754
Don't say "we."

481
00:34:30,755 --> 00:34:32,340
It makes us sound like family.

482
00:34:34,342 --> 00:34:35,927
You already know

483
00:34:37,553 --> 00:34:40,223
Ji-hu is going back to the US for you.

484
00:34:41,057 --> 00:34:43,684
He thinks that if he stays,
he'll only be a nuisance.

485
00:34:44,477 --> 00:34:45,645
That small kid

486
00:34:45,728 --> 00:34:48,314
is trying so hard to protect
someone dear to him.

487
00:34:49,982 --> 00:34:51,150
As the adults,

488
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,654
we need to do our part.

489
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,198
I…

490
00:34:58,241 --> 00:34:59,742
have a favor to ask of you.

491
00:35:00,451 --> 00:35:02,120
Sure, anything.

492
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:08,835
Don't get smart with me.

493
00:35:09,877 --> 00:35:11,170
Let me ask you one too.

494
00:35:11,254 --> 00:35:12,088
Don't.

495
00:35:12,171 --> 00:35:13,923
Don't live such a lonely life anymore.

496
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:38,656
I'll escort him safely, Ms. Gu.

497
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,201
I'll go now.

498
00:35:42,994 --> 00:35:44,162
Take care.

499
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,373
Have a safe trip.

500
00:36:05,975 --> 00:36:07,059
I love you

501
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,770
so, so much.

502
00:36:11,689 --> 00:36:13,149
I'll see you again.

503
00:36:44,931 --> 00:36:45,973
Mom.

504
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:47,725
Where are we going?

505
00:36:50,394 --> 00:36:51,395
We're going home.

506
00:36:52,021 --> 00:36:53,689
- Home?
- Yes.

507
00:36:53,773 --> 00:36:54,815
Let's go.

508
00:37:31,477 --> 00:37:32,979
Thank you for coming.

509
00:37:33,062 --> 00:37:34,230
Let us begin.

510
00:37:34,313 --> 00:37:35,731
You just took over King Hotel,

511
00:37:35,815 --> 00:37:39,110
yet you're already about to open
hotel chains in 16 different countries.

512
00:37:39,193 --> 00:37:41,946
What gave you that push
to turn your domestic hotel

513
00:37:42,029 --> 00:37:43,614
into a global chain?

514
00:37:46,784 --> 00:37:50,788
I looked back
on the past 100 years of King Hotel.

515
00:37:51,622 --> 00:37:53,916
There were times
when we were desperate to survive.

516
00:37:55,001 --> 00:37:57,044
At other times,
we were drunk on our success.

517
00:37:58,212 --> 00:37:59,922
Over those years,

518
00:38:00,715 --> 00:38:02,842
only one thing remained constant.

519
00:38:03,426 --> 00:38:06,178
It was the heart of those
who took care of this hotel.

520
00:38:07,013 --> 00:38:08,931
Such people kept our hotel together.

521
00:38:09,515 --> 00:38:12,476
I only stood on the shoulder of that giant

522
00:38:13,269 --> 00:38:15,146
to look out at the world.

523
00:38:15,229 --> 00:38:18,190
You've moved on from a local hotel
to become a global chain.

524
00:38:18,274 --> 00:38:20,234
What are your next steps?

525
00:38:20,318 --> 00:38:22,194
We'll make our way to Europe,

526
00:38:22,945 --> 00:38:24,322
where many chains have failed.

527
00:38:24,947 --> 00:38:27,575
You're going to see new, innovative hotels

528
00:38:27,658 --> 00:38:29,619
previously unseen from existing chains.

529
00:38:29,702 --> 00:38:31,871
Your management style
is rather aggressive.

530
00:38:31,954 --> 00:38:34,624
Is it your goal to make King Hotel
the best in the world?

531
00:38:51,098 --> 00:38:53,726
On the day I was appointed
as the head manager,

532
00:38:53,809 --> 00:38:55,686
I said,

533
00:38:55,770 --> 00:39:00,941
"I'll make King Hotel
a place without fake smiles."

534
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:05,571
I used to think
most people's smiles were fake.

535
00:39:06,197 --> 00:39:09,241
However, I met someone
who could smile with all her heart,

536
00:39:10,034 --> 00:39:14,789
and I came to realize
how beautiful a smile could be.

537
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:19,210
King Hotel's goal
isn't to be the best in the world.

538
00:39:19,293 --> 00:39:22,838
It's to become a hotel
where everyone can smile from their heart.

539
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,424
That

540
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:28,469
is the goal of King Hotel.

541
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:37,728
GUIDE TO HOTEL AMOR

542
00:40:07,842 --> 00:40:10,803
<i>Where love begins. Hotel Amor.</i>

543
00:40:10,886 --> 00:40:13,305
<i>We'll open for reservations tonight.</i>

544
00:40:18,144 --> 00:40:19,186
All done.

545
00:40:39,123 --> 00:40:40,207
Everything's ready.

546
00:40:51,677 --> 00:40:54,138
<i>I just finished getting ready to open.</i>

547
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:56,766
<i>I miss you so much.</i>

548
00:41:09,278 --> 00:41:10,821
He must be busy.

549
00:41:14,992 --> 00:41:16,410
I need a nap.

550
00:41:17,077 --> 00:41:18,412
I'm so tired.

551
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,873
Just for a moment.

552
00:41:46,148 --> 00:41:47,399
<i>You'll be there alone.</i>

553
00:41:47,483 --> 00:41:48,442
For emergencies.

554
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,439
- Have you been well?
- Yes.

555
00:42:27,523 --> 00:42:28,816
What's going on?

556
00:42:28,899 --> 00:42:31,861
I missed you so much.
It's wonderful to see you here.

557
00:42:32,444 --> 00:42:33,946
I missed you too, so I ran over.

558
00:42:35,865 --> 00:42:37,116
What's all this?

559
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:38,868
They're so pretty!

560
00:42:38,951 --> 00:42:40,411
I'm glad you like them.

561
00:42:40,494 --> 00:42:41,996
I wanted to give these to you.

562
00:42:43,122 --> 00:42:45,749
Thank you.
Did you do this all by yourself?

563
00:43:05,352 --> 00:43:07,730
You have such great taste.

564
00:43:08,564 --> 00:43:10,733
I guess you know your stuff.

565
00:43:10,816 --> 00:43:14,236
Do you want to sell this hotel?
I'd like to buy it out.

566
00:43:14,987 --> 00:43:18,157
This is a five-S hotel,
so it's quite expensive.

567
00:43:19,825 --> 00:43:22,411
I've heard of five-star hotels,

568
00:43:22,494 --> 00:43:24,872
but never a five-S hotel.

569
00:43:26,165 --> 00:43:27,416
Five smiles.

570
00:43:28,792 --> 00:43:30,961
That's why it's a five-smile hotel.

571
00:43:36,467 --> 00:43:38,260
"Where love begins."

572
00:43:38,928 --> 00:43:41,096
- Hence, Hotel Amor?
- Yes.

573
00:43:43,182 --> 00:43:45,392
This is a wonderful place,
full of romance.

574
00:43:46,602 --> 00:43:49,980
I remembered the bed and breakfast
we stayed at in Gapado.

575
00:43:51,899 --> 00:43:54,735
<i>We detested each other so much,</i>

576
00:43:55,319 --> 00:43:57,196
<i>yet we were so close on that day.</i>

577
00:43:58,989 --> 00:44:02,910
<i>In a way, that was the place
our journey began.</i>

578
00:44:05,329 --> 00:44:06,497
That's why

579
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:10,501
I wanted to create a place
where love starts to bloom.

580
00:44:11,126 --> 00:44:14,546
Are you talking about
the most luxurious hotel

581
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:17,174
and the best restaurant in Gapado?

582
00:44:17,257 --> 00:44:18,300
Yes.

583
00:44:20,386 --> 00:44:22,388
The Chinese bushclover wine was delicious.

584
00:44:22,471 --> 00:44:23,597
I'm craving it.

585
00:44:24,515 --> 00:44:28,394
I had fun riding a bike together.

586
00:44:29,103 --> 00:44:30,145
I want to do it again.

587
00:44:30,229 --> 00:44:31,689
We should go back.

588
00:44:31,772 --> 00:44:33,273
- Should we?
- Yes.

589
00:44:33,941 --> 00:44:35,025
Let's do that.

590
00:44:36,318 --> 00:44:37,319
One second.

591
00:44:38,404 --> 00:44:39,613
ONE RESERVATION CONFIRMED

592
00:44:41,323 --> 00:44:42,324
It's a reservation!

593
00:44:42,408 --> 00:44:44,201
Let me see. Really?

594
00:44:44,785 --> 00:44:47,871
Hey, you got a reservation
as soon as you opened.

595
00:44:48,455 --> 00:44:50,082
Ms. Cheon, how impressive.

596
00:44:51,625 --> 00:44:52,501
Yes, that's me.

597
00:44:53,794 --> 00:44:55,713
Only you could pull this off.

598
00:44:56,588 --> 00:44:57,589
Congratulations.

599
00:44:59,216 --> 00:45:00,134
Thanks.

600
00:45:02,886 --> 00:45:05,264
It's pretty late. Shouldn't you go?

601
00:45:05,347 --> 00:45:06,849
You have work tomorrow.

602
00:45:13,439 --> 00:45:14,648
Just a little longer.

603
00:45:21,488 --> 00:45:22,448
I mean,

604
00:45:24,408 --> 00:45:25,701
if you leave too late,

605
00:45:26,618 --> 00:45:28,829
you'll be sleepy and tired.

606
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:42,718
Do you want to spend the night?

607
00:47:06,426 --> 00:47:08,720
It's even prettier in the morning.

608
00:47:24,069 --> 00:47:24,903
Here.

609
00:47:54,725 --> 00:47:55,851
One, two, three.

610
00:47:56,476 --> 00:47:57,728
One, two, three.

611
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:05,777
Right, Sa-rang's hotel.

612
00:48:05,861 --> 00:48:07,446
- Hotel Amor.
- Yes.

613
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:10,449
- I couldn't get a reservation again.
- Really?

614
00:48:11,325 --> 00:48:12,743
I failed too.

615
00:48:13,327 --> 00:48:15,787
The six of us said
we'd meet up over a month ago.

616
00:48:16,413 --> 00:48:17,247
Right?

617
00:48:17,915 --> 00:48:20,667
But I'm glad her hotel is fully booked.

618
00:48:22,377 --> 00:48:24,379
I should go over and help her out soon.

619
00:48:27,132 --> 00:48:28,550
Where are we going?

620
00:48:31,011 --> 00:48:32,054
To meet Mom.

621
00:48:32,971 --> 00:48:34,097
Mom?

622
00:48:34,681 --> 00:48:35,891
Whose mom?

623
00:48:36,934 --> 00:48:38,268
Who do you think?

624
00:48:40,145 --> 00:48:43,607
You gave me a scarf
to give to my mom, remember?

625
00:48:44,191 --> 00:48:45,859
Yes, I did.

626
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,653
Since that day,

627
00:48:47,736 --> 00:48:49,863
she's been asking me to bring you over.

628
00:48:49,947 --> 00:48:52,658
What? No, I can't.

629
00:48:52,741 --> 00:48:54,868
I'm not dressed properly,
and my hair's a mess.

630
00:48:54,952 --> 00:48:57,079
I need to fix my makeup too.

631
00:48:57,162 --> 00:48:58,288
You already look great.

632
00:48:59,206 --> 00:49:00,999
I'm not ready to meet her yet.

633
00:49:01,583 --> 00:49:04,002
And I don't have a present.
I can't go empty-handed.

634
00:49:04,086 --> 00:49:07,172
Anyway, I can't. Turn the car around.

635
00:49:07,255 --> 00:49:09,883
I'm not turning around.
We'll be there soon.

636
00:49:09,967 --> 00:49:12,594
Gosh, you should have told me.

637
00:49:13,178 --> 00:49:15,347
I didn't even bring my makeup bag.

638
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:33,323
Mom, Pyeong-hwa is here.

639
00:49:34,825 --> 00:49:35,993
Say hi to her.

640
00:49:36,576 --> 00:49:37,744
This is my mom.

641
00:49:53,677 --> 00:49:54,720
Hello.

642
00:49:55,721 --> 00:49:57,431
My name is Oh Pyeong-hwa.

643
00:50:07,983 --> 00:50:08,900
Mom,

644
00:50:08,984 --> 00:50:10,360
she's my girlfriend.

645
00:50:11,445 --> 00:50:12,779
What do you think?

646
00:50:13,405 --> 00:50:14,406
Isn't she pretty?

647
00:50:15,115 --> 00:50:17,784
Not only is she pretty,
but she also has a big heart.

648
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:39,431
We will be…

649
00:50:41,516 --> 00:50:43,351
happy together for a long time.

650
00:50:45,353 --> 00:50:46,521
Please watch over us.

651
00:51:02,704 --> 00:51:04,289
Let me know if you need anything.

652
00:51:04,372 --> 00:51:06,041
- Okay, thank you.
- Sure.

653
00:51:15,342 --> 00:51:16,343
I'm hungry.

654
00:51:22,432 --> 00:51:23,391
When did you come?

655
00:51:23,475 --> 00:51:24,476
Right now.

656
00:51:25,185 --> 00:51:27,145
You must be hungry. Late-night snacks?

657
00:51:38,115 --> 00:51:39,116
My gosh!

658
00:51:40,408 --> 00:51:41,952
- What?
- Move aside. It's dangerous.

659
00:51:42,035 --> 00:51:43,495
- One.
- Two.

660
00:51:43,578 --> 00:51:44,538
- Three.
- Three.

661
00:51:50,627 --> 00:51:52,254
Why are you here again?

662
00:51:53,255 --> 00:51:54,297
I was just passing by.

663
00:51:54,381 --> 00:51:56,299
That makes no sense.

664
00:51:56,383 --> 00:51:58,343
I saw the lights off as I passed by.

665
00:51:58,426 --> 00:51:59,386
Stop lying.

666
00:51:59,469 --> 00:52:00,887
You should call me for help.

667
00:52:00,971 --> 00:52:02,264
Aren't you tired?

668
00:52:02,848 --> 00:52:04,057
I should get some rest.

669
00:52:11,398 --> 00:52:13,441
I knew you would do this.

670
00:52:13,525 --> 00:52:15,735
I said I'd throw out the food waste.

671
00:52:15,819 --> 00:52:16,695
Give me.

672
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:19,239
These are recyclables.

673
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:21,825
- You're right.
- Why are you here again?

674
00:52:21,908 --> 00:52:24,077
To take out the garbage. Where is it?

675
00:52:24,161 --> 00:52:25,328
Over there?

676
00:52:26,288 --> 00:52:28,165
Where? Outside?

677
00:52:28,248 --> 00:52:29,708
- Outside.
- Here?

678
00:52:29,791 --> 00:52:31,585
No, outside. Out there.

679
00:52:37,257 --> 00:52:39,050
You were out of toilet paper last time.

680
00:52:41,845 --> 00:52:43,221
- Toilet paper?
- Yes.

681
00:52:43,805 --> 00:52:44,723
Toilet paper?

682
00:52:45,682 --> 00:52:46,516
Toilet paper.

683
00:52:53,481 --> 00:52:56,276
So there's the toilet paper.

684
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:58,028
Why do you have so much?

685
00:53:03,783 --> 00:53:04,826
We need to talk.

686
00:53:10,916 --> 00:53:11,958
Hey.

687
00:53:12,042 --> 00:53:14,920
You're not close by.
You can't come visit me every day.

688
00:53:15,003 --> 00:53:16,338
I'm not tired. I'm fine.

689
00:53:16,421 --> 00:53:18,423
Have you looked at yourself in the mirror?

690
00:53:18,506 --> 00:53:19,841
Have you even seen your eyes?

691
00:53:20,425 --> 00:53:24,346
Your dark circles
have reached your cheekbones.

692
00:53:24,429 --> 00:53:25,805
My gosh.

693
00:53:27,224 --> 00:53:29,643
Stop coming over.
I'll come to you when I'm free.

694
00:53:29,726 --> 00:53:32,729
You're fully booked this month.
How can you manage alone?

695
00:53:33,563 --> 00:53:36,274
I already uploaded a job ad.

696
00:53:36,358 --> 00:53:38,109
I'll find a part-timer. Don't worry.

697
00:53:41,196 --> 00:53:42,280
A…

698
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:46,993
A part-timer?

699
00:53:48,286 --> 00:53:50,247
Are you being serious?

700
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:53,541
I'm doing this
because I'm worried about you.

701
00:53:54,084 --> 00:53:54,918
Promise me.

702
00:53:55,001 --> 00:53:58,421
Promise that you won't come over
every single day.

703
00:53:58,922 --> 00:54:00,465
You're busy enough already.

704
00:54:01,841 --> 00:54:02,801
Now.

705
00:54:08,348 --> 00:54:09,391
Fine.

706
00:54:10,892 --> 00:54:11,935
I won't come.

707
00:54:12,686 --> 00:54:14,604
Do you mean it? You promised.

708
00:54:16,106 --> 00:54:17,190
Okay.

709
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:20,318
And this too.

710
00:54:24,948 --> 00:54:25,949
Good.

711
00:54:34,374 --> 00:54:37,877
Can you start right away?

712
00:54:37,961 --> 00:54:39,587
May I work on weekdays?

713
00:54:41,339 --> 00:54:44,301
I'm looking for someone
to work weekends right now.

714
00:54:44,884 --> 00:54:46,344
I have to hang out on weekends.

715
00:54:48,305 --> 00:54:51,599
I cover your food, lodging,
and transportation expenses.

716
00:54:51,683 --> 00:54:52,892
Is it still too difficult?

717
00:54:52,976 --> 00:54:54,352
Of course it is.

718
00:54:54,978 --> 00:54:57,439
Isn't doing my job enough?
Why am I forced to smile?

719
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,362
Wouldn't our guests be happier
if you welcome them with a smile?

720
00:55:04,446 --> 00:55:05,322
Well,

721
00:55:05,405 --> 00:55:08,366
can I be in charge of the office
instead of cleaning and stuff?

722
00:55:25,717 --> 00:55:27,844
I looked over your résumé.

723
00:55:28,887 --> 00:55:32,223
Can you really work weekends
when you already have a full-time job?

724
00:55:34,017 --> 00:55:36,436
I'm always free on weekends.

725
00:55:36,519 --> 00:55:39,356
On top of that, I'm very fit,
so it won't be a problem.

726
00:55:39,439 --> 00:55:41,900
And everyone has two jobs now.
I should work hard too.

727
00:55:43,026 --> 00:55:45,779
The president of King Hotel
doesn't need two jobs.

728
00:55:45,862 --> 00:55:47,072
You're busy as it is.

729
00:55:47,155 --> 00:55:48,948
That's why I should work even harder.

730
00:55:49,616 --> 00:55:53,453
I heard the president here
used to be the hotel's best talent.

731
00:55:53,995 --> 00:55:56,790
I'd like to learn from you.
Please hire me.

732
00:55:57,791 --> 00:55:59,459
No. Please leave.

733
00:55:59,542 --> 00:56:01,211
Yes. Please take me.

734
00:56:08,718 --> 00:56:09,636
In that case,

735
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:11,388
show me your smile.

736
00:56:14,933 --> 00:56:16,226
Gosh.

737
00:56:16,309 --> 00:56:18,395
You aren't ready to smile wholeheartedly.

738
00:56:18,478 --> 00:56:19,479
Disqualified!

739
00:56:20,105 --> 00:56:21,731
One second. Give me another chance.

740
00:56:22,565 --> 00:56:24,234
Let me try again.

741
00:56:29,948 --> 00:56:30,990
Please

742
00:56:31,991 --> 00:56:32,992
hire me.

743
00:56:40,792 --> 00:56:41,960
Is that a real smile?

744
00:56:42,043 --> 00:56:43,086
Yes.

745
00:56:43,169 --> 00:56:44,921
Not a fake one?

746
00:56:45,004 --> 00:56:45,922
No.

747
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:51,761
You can start next week.

748
00:56:53,138 --> 00:56:55,223
Thank you, Ms. Cheon. I'll do my best.

749
00:56:55,306 --> 00:56:58,268
That's a given. You have to do well.

750
00:56:58,351 --> 00:57:00,603
- Can you do that?
- Yes, I can!

751
00:57:01,271 --> 00:57:02,439
Excellent.

752
00:57:02,522 --> 00:57:03,940
That's all for the interview.

753
00:57:04,023 --> 00:57:05,442
Come to work next week.

754
00:57:10,155 --> 00:57:12,198
I still have to pass
the most important interview.

755
00:57:15,410 --> 00:57:16,286
Sorry?

756
00:57:20,415 --> 00:57:22,167
I want to be with you forever.

757
00:57:51,696 --> 00:57:52,947
Will you marry me?

758
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:43,915
I love you.

759
00:58:44,874 --> 00:58:46,417
I love you more.

760
00:59:13,987 --> 00:59:15,822
Everything is ready. Come on out.

761
00:59:16,406 --> 00:59:18,074
Okay. We're coming.

762
00:59:24,706 --> 00:59:26,916
- Please have a seat.
- Okay.

763
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:28,835
She looks great.

764
00:59:30,378 --> 00:59:32,213
You look so pretty, Grandma.

765
00:59:32,297 --> 00:59:34,465
What is this?
I'm scared someone may see me.

766
00:59:34,549 --> 00:59:36,426
No, you could compete in pageants.

767
00:59:36,509 --> 00:59:37,427
What?

768
00:59:37,510 --> 00:59:39,929
Everyone does this now.
You're like a princess.

769
00:59:40,013 --> 00:59:41,306
Goodness.

770
00:59:41,389 --> 00:59:43,433
How can this old woman be a princess?

771
00:59:44,017 --> 00:59:47,312
If you aren't the princess,
you must be the queen.

772
00:59:47,896 --> 00:59:50,189
Your Majesty the Queen, happy birthday.

773
00:59:51,733 --> 00:59:53,067
- Two, three.
- Two, three.

774
00:59:53,151 --> 00:59:55,987
<i>- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you</i>

775
00:59:56,070 --> 00:59:58,364
<i>- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you</i>

776
00:59:58,448 --> 01:00:01,701
<i>- Happy birthday, dear Grandma
- Happy birthday, dear Grandma</i>

777
01:00:01,784 --> 01:00:04,746
<i>- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you</i>

778
01:00:05,747 --> 01:00:06,623
Blow them out.

779
01:00:06,706 --> 01:00:09,542
Okay. Come closer and do it with me.

780
01:00:09,626 --> 01:00:10,668
Should we?

781
01:00:11,252 --> 01:00:12,962
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

782
01:00:16,090 --> 01:00:18,384
Goodness, this is embarrassing.

783
01:00:29,395 --> 01:00:30,563
All right.

784
01:00:30,647 --> 01:00:32,607
Let me try it first.

785
01:00:40,281 --> 01:00:41,157
It's so good.

786
01:00:41,866 --> 01:00:43,910
Of course. I made this.

787
01:00:44,744 --> 01:00:46,829
Ma'am, please try some.

788
01:00:46,913 --> 01:00:51,042
So are you sure people can eat this?

789
01:00:51,125 --> 01:00:54,295
Of course. What do you take me for?

790
01:00:54,379 --> 01:00:56,255
I'm asking because I know you.

791
01:00:59,926 --> 01:01:00,760
Let's see.

792
01:01:01,511 --> 01:01:02,428
Here we go.

793
01:01:11,354 --> 01:01:12,522
Perfectly seasoned.

794
01:01:13,606 --> 01:01:16,526
- Not so bad.
- I'm good at everything.

795
01:01:21,239 --> 01:01:22,240
Did you make this too?

796
01:01:22,323 --> 01:01:24,784
I bought that.

797
01:01:25,410 --> 01:01:28,371
I knew it. This was the most delicious.

798
01:01:28,454 --> 01:01:30,748
And picking up nice food
is also a great skill.

799
01:01:30,832 --> 01:01:33,835
You always have a way with words.

800
01:01:33,918 --> 01:01:35,378
My gosh.

801
01:02:01,487 --> 01:02:03,031
I'd like to tell you something.

802
01:02:03,114 --> 01:02:05,324
Yes? What is it?

803
01:02:06,409 --> 01:02:07,535
You're very serious.

804
01:02:08,619 --> 01:02:09,871
Did you do something wrong?

805
01:02:12,165 --> 01:02:14,375
We'd like to get married.

806
01:02:17,170 --> 01:02:20,673
We'll always cherish each other
and live a happy life.

807
01:02:22,759 --> 01:02:26,596
I think I'll always be happy with him.

808
01:02:29,682 --> 01:02:30,516
Yes.

809
01:02:31,726 --> 01:02:32,852
So you should.

810
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:40,234
That's wonderful.

811
01:02:49,952 --> 01:02:51,329
Grandma, why are you crying?

812
01:03:00,755 --> 01:03:02,173
We'll be happy.

813
01:03:02,256 --> 01:03:04,300
Yes, you should be.

814
01:03:05,134 --> 01:03:06,552
Does he pass?

815
01:03:06,636 --> 01:03:08,679
Yes, he does.

816
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:13,226
I do, right?

817
01:03:49,095 --> 01:03:50,471
It's Uncle Won.

818
01:04:10,199 --> 01:04:12,034
You must be Ji-hu.

819
01:04:12,118 --> 01:04:14,954
Yes, my name is Yoon Ji-hu.

820
01:04:16,205 --> 01:04:17,915
Who are you?

821
01:04:20,877 --> 01:04:23,588
I'm Uncle Won's mom.

822
01:04:24,714 --> 01:04:25,715
That makes you…

823
01:04:27,175 --> 01:04:28,009
my grandma?

824
01:04:28,593 --> 01:04:30,094
Are you my grandma?

825
01:04:31,012 --> 01:04:33,764
You're very smart, just like your mom.

826
01:04:34,974 --> 01:04:35,892
May I…

827
01:04:37,643 --> 01:04:39,312
give you a hug?

828
01:04:39,395 --> 01:04:40,521
Yes.

829
01:04:58,164 --> 01:05:00,249
You've raised him beautifully.

830
01:05:01,292 --> 01:05:02,668
You did a great job.

831
01:05:39,497 --> 01:05:40,915
Let's go and find your auntie.

832
01:05:41,832 --> 01:05:42,875
There she is.

833
01:05:42,959 --> 01:05:45,211
- Cho-rong.
- Hello.

834
01:05:45,294 --> 01:05:47,713
- Hello.
- Hello.

835
01:05:48,714 --> 01:05:49,924
Yes, hello.

836
01:05:51,467 --> 01:05:53,678
Hello, you must be Cho-rong.

837
01:05:54,428 --> 01:05:55,721
Is he your boyfriend?

838
01:05:56,389 --> 01:05:57,515
- Yes.
- Gosh.

839
01:05:57,598 --> 01:05:59,767
He's so cool, like a prince.

840
01:05:59,850 --> 01:06:00,768
You pass!

841
01:06:02,561 --> 01:06:04,897
Goodness, thank you for giving me a pass.

842
01:06:05,815 --> 01:06:06,732
Hello.

843
01:06:07,566 --> 01:06:09,277
You must be Cho-rong.

844
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:11,654
It's a no for you. You don't pass.

845
01:06:11,737 --> 01:06:14,115
What's with the rejection?
Why don't I pass?

846
01:06:15,157 --> 01:06:16,367
You make funny jokes.

847
01:06:16,867 --> 01:06:17,910
- Hello.
- Hello.

848
01:06:19,036 --> 01:06:20,538
It's hot in here.

849
01:06:35,261 --> 01:06:36,637
You look great.

850
01:06:37,221 --> 01:06:38,889
I thought you wouldn't come.

851
01:06:42,393 --> 01:06:45,354
Your mom told me a parent's job

852
01:06:46,272 --> 01:06:48,524
was to let his child live their own life.

853
01:06:49,525 --> 01:06:52,486
She said you should get to live
the life you want for yourself.

854
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:57,199
It's overdue, but congrats.

855
01:07:07,209 --> 01:07:09,587
I hope you live a very happy life.

856
01:07:12,048 --> 01:07:13,007
I will.

857
01:07:30,107 --> 01:07:31,233
It's time.

858
01:07:31,942 --> 01:07:32,985
Let's go.

859
01:07:53,881 --> 01:07:57,551
Our son has grown old enough
to get married.

860
01:07:58,594 --> 01:07:59,762
It sure hits you differently.

861
01:08:01,806 --> 01:08:04,141
Stop acting friendly
as if nothing has happened.

862
01:08:09,397 --> 01:08:12,149
Do you want to get a cup of tea
after the wedding?

863
01:08:16,904 --> 01:08:18,197
And now,

864
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:21,200
the dashing groom will enter.

865
01:08:21,909 --> 01:08:24,453
Please welcome the groom!

866
01:08:36,132 --> 01:08:38,676
Please welcome the groom!

867
01:09:02,116 --> 01:09:03,660
You look wonderful!

868
01:09:14,837 --> 01:09:15,713
Next,

869
01:09:15,797 --> 01:09:17,382
the woman of the hour,

870
01:09:17,465 --> 01:09:19,258
the bride, will enter.

871
01:09:20,051 --> 01:09:22,762
Please welcome the bride.

872
01:10:14,355 --> 01:10:15,440
You're so pretty!

873
01:10:16,649 --> 01:10:17,734
You're beautiful!

874
01:11:07,950 --> 01:11:09,160
Shall we go?

875
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:14,207
Anywhere with you.

876
01:11:41,359 --> 01:11:44,362
KING THE LAND

877
01:12:17,395 --> 01:12:20,898
EPILOGUE

878
01:12:26,863 --> 01:12:28,030
{\an8}- No?
- No.

879
01:12:39,625 --> 01:12:41,335
{\an8}Right? White's a bit much.

880
01:12:42,461 --> 01:12:43,588
{\an8}I thought so too.

881
01:12:52,388 --> 01:12:54,390
{\an8}- Should I go change?
- You should go change.

882
01:12:54,473 --> 01:12:55,600
{\an8}I can't breathe.

883
01:13:17,163 --> 01:13:18,956
You look great. Let's go with this one.

884
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:20,166
Do you like this one?

885
01:13:20,249 --> 01:13:22,460
I liked everything,
but this one's the best.

886
01:13:24,378 --> 01:13:25,630
Shall we go now?

887
01:13:26,339 --> 01:13:27,423
Shall we?

888
01:13:27,506 --> 01:13:28,507
Yes.

889
01:13:28,591 --> 01:13:29,592
Let's go home.

890
01:13:30,843 --> 01:13:32,762
People are watching.

891
01:13:32,845 --> 01:13:33,888
What people?

892
01:13:35,473 --> 01:13:36,515
Over there.

893
01:13:40,019 --> 01:13:41,228
Who cares?

894
01:13:41,799 --> 01:13:45,119
{\an8}THANKS FOR WATCHING
