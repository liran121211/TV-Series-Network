1
00:00:48,589 --> 00:00:52,036
KING THE LAND

2
00:00:52,449 --> 00:00:54,062
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:54,143 --> 00:00:55,882
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:56,242 --> 00:00:57,285
Now.

5
00:00:57,869 --> 00:01:00,580
This is the highlight of the meal.

6
00:01:22,727 --> 00:01:23,770
Are you all right?

7
00:01:23,853 --> 00:01:25,272
Are you hurt?

8
00:01:25,355 --> 00:01:26,356
No.

9
00:01:30,527 --> 00:01:32,028
What will you do with all these?

10
00:01:37,575 --> 00:01:39,035
As long as you aren't hurt,

11
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:40,912
it's all right.

12
00:02:24,164 --> 00:02:25,290
Do I have…

13
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:28,001
permission?

14
00:04:26,911 --> 00:04:27,954
Here.

15
00:04:33,334 --> 00:04:34,419
Gosh.

16
00:04:36,588 --> 00:04:37,464
Here.

17
00:04:37,547 --> 00:04:38,631
Thank you.

18
00:04:46,764 --> 00:04:48,475
I don't know what this is,

19
00:04:48,558 --> 00:04:49,893
but it's really good.

20
00:04:49,976 --> 00:04:53,438
I wanted to cook the best meal for you.

21
00:04:55,106 --> 00:04:56,441
You already did.

22
00:04:57,358 --> 00:04:59,027
It was the best meal

23
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,071
and the best dining atmosphere of my life.

24
00:05:03,573 --> 00:05:04,991
I'm glad you liked it.

25
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,076
I'll cook for you again.

26
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,912
I'll cook next time.

27
00:05:08,995 --> 00:05:09,913
When?

28
00:05:10,497 --> 00:05:11,331
Tomorrow?

29
00:05:12,123 --> 00:05:12,999
No.

30
00:05:13,082 --> 00:05:14,125
Then when?

31
00:05:17,795 --> 00:05:19,589
When you look the most adorable.

32
00:05:22,425 --> 00:05:23,343
Cheers.

33
00:05:36,689 --> 00:05:37,690
Let's eat.

34
00:05:41,277 --> 00:05:43,029
You must really be good at everything.

35
00:05:43,112 --> 00:05:44,280
Of course.

36
00:05:45,365 --> 00:05:47,075
Though I don't know what this is.

37
00:05:48,076 --> 00:05:50,495
EPISODE 9

38
00:05:54,749 --> 00:05:57,043
We only need 500 more dollars.

39
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,174
We're doomed.

40
00:06:03,758 --> 00:06:05,009
We're closing soon,

41
00:06:05,093 --> 00:06:07,095
and there's not a person in sight.

42
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,722
Ha-neul, should I just buy a bag?

43
00:06:10,932 --> 00:06:13,268
You don't want to face legal issues.

44
00:06:13,351 --> 00:06:14,894
Just go on a trip with those 500 dollars.

45
00:06:20,733 --> 00:06:22,902
But it's only fun if we all go together.

46
00:06:23,486 --> 00:06:25,071
I'll pay for a team trip
if I win the lottery.

47
00:06:25,154 --> 00:06:26,531
You don't even buy tickets.

48
00:06:26,614 --> 00:06:28,074
I will from now on.

49
00:06:28,157 --> 00:06:30,827
You all went through a lot
working overtime.

50
00:06:31,411 --> 00:06:33,204
Let's eat grilled beef intestines.
It's on me.

51
00:06:34,914 --> 00:06:36,040
Let's wrap up now.

52
00:06:36,124 --> 00:06:37,125
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

53
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:38,876
Yes, ma'am.

54
00:06:42,213 --> 00:06:43,840
Welcome to Alanga!

55
00:06:43,923 --> 00:06:46,426
- Welcome to Alanga!
- Welcome to Alanga!

56
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:47,635
Please come in!

57
00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:49,762
- This way, please.
- What do you think of this?

58
00:06:49,846 --> 00:06:50,972
It's the latest design.

59
00:06:51,723 --> 00:06:52,807
Thank you.

60
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,771
Thank you. Enjoy your trip.

61
00:06:58,855 --> 00:07:01,399
- Thank you. Enjoy your trip.
- Thank you. Enjoy your trip.

62
00:07:11,492 --> 00:07:15,204
A toast to celebrate
Purser Oh Pyeong-hwa's promotion.

63
00:07:15,288 --> 00:07:17,373
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

64
00:07:17,957 --> 00:07:20,084
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

65
00:07:20,168 --> 00:07:22,253
Stop it. That's enough.

66
00:07:22,337 --> 00:07:23,338
Why?

67
00:07:23,421 --> 00:07:27,008
Ms. Yoo said the most important criteria
for promotion was in-flight sales.

68
00:07:27,091 --> 00:07:29,427
You had the most sales
and our team came in first.

69
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,596
- There's no doubt about it.
- Of course.

70
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:33,389
You've been through a lot.

71
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:36,976
Purser Oh, once you're promoted,

72
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,811
don't forget about us and help us out.

73
00:07:38,895 --> 00:07:40,271
I'll swear my allegiance.

74
00:07:40,355 --> 00:07:41,856
That's enough.

75
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:43,191
I told you to stop.

76
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,527
Ma'am, over here!

77
00:07:47,737 --> 00:07:48,738
Hello.

78
00:07:50,406 --> 00:07:51,741
What took you so long?

79
00:07:51,824 --> 00:07:54,118
We were so bored without you.

80
00:07:54,202 --> 00:07:55,953
Seems like you were having fun.

81
00:07:56,037 --> 00:07:57,413
You're better off without this old-timer.

82
00:07:57,497 --> 00:07:59,457
Goodness. Why would you say that?

83
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:03,127
- Sit over here, ma'am.
- Thank you.

84
00:08:03,628 --> 00:08:05,505
- One draft beer, please.
- Coming right up.

85
00:08:07,715 --> 00:08:09,676
You all worked so hard.

86
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,596
Especially the major contributor,
Ms. Oh Pyeong-hwa, who carried our team

87
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,223
from last to first.

88
00:08:15,306 --> 00:08:18,476
Why don't we give her a round of applause?

89
00:08:21,437 --> 00:08:23,648
It's all thanks to you. Thank you.

90
00:08:24,982 --> 00:08:26,317
It's thanks to you all

91
00:08:26,401 --> 00:08:28,194
that our team was able to rank first.

92
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:31,698
This is a token of my appreciation.

93
00:08:32,907 --> 00:08:36,119
I feel bad receiving this
when everyone worked so hard.

94
00:08:36,202 --> 00:08:37,829
You have every right to receive it.

95
00:08:38,329 --> 00:08:39,372
Treat yourself.

96
00:08:39,997 --> 00:08:42,291
Thank you. I'll use it well.

97
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,752
Now for the highlight of the evening.

98
00:08:44,836 --> 00:08:46,838
I have an important announcement to make.

99
00:08:47,338 --> 00:08:50,717
Someone among us
will be promoted to purser.

100
00:08:53,052 --> 00:08:54,345
Drumroll, please.

101
00:08:54,429 --> 00:08:55,930
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR PROMOTION,
OH PYEONG-HWA

102
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:58,599
Congratulations on your promotion.

103
00:08:58,683 --> 00:09:00,810
You've worked so hard, Mi-na.

104
00:09:05,314 --> 00:09:06,149
Me?

105
00:09:06,232 --> 00:09:07,567
Here's your purser scarf.

106
00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:12,780
Thank you.

107
00:09:13,448 --> 00:09:16,117
I'll do my best. Thank you.

108
00:09:16,701 --> 00:09:18,619
Purser Hwang, congratulations.

109
00:09:19,912 --> 00:09:20,997
Thank you.

110
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,542
This is amazing.

111
00:09:26,544 --> 00:09:28,504
As expected, it looks good on you.

112
00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:33,509
<i>- Don't bash me
- Don't bash me</i>

113
00:09:33,593 --> 00:09:37,221
<i>- Saying I'm a cruel woman
- Saying I'm a cruel woman</i>

114
00:09:37,305 --> 00:09:40,308
<i>- It was for you
- It was for you</i>

115
00:09:40,391 --> 00:09:43,936
<i>That I chose to break up…</i>

116
00:09:46,689 --> 00:09:47,732
I'm sorry.

117
00:09:48,608 --> 00:09:49,817
How can I dare surpass you

118
00:09:50,485 --> 00:09:54,447
when you're my senior by many years?

119
00:09:56,407 --> 00:09:57,408
It's okay.

120
00:09:57,492 --> 00:09:58,993
You don't have to worry about me.

121
00:09:59,076 --> 00:10:01,746
You did a great job. Congratulations.

122
00:10:03,831 --> 00:10:06,667
Cut the nonsense about being okay.

123
00:10:06,751 --> 00:10:07,668
You must be jealous.

124
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,298
If you're jealous,
just say you're jealous.

125
00:10:12,381 --> 00:10:14,342
The nonchalance
makes you look more pathetic.

126
00:10:14,425 --> 00:10:15,635
Stop drinking.

127
00:10:16,302 --> 00:10:17,136
You're drunk.

128
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,889
That's why you should've tried harder.

129
00:10:20,765 --> 00:10:22,892
It's such a happy day for me

130
00:10:23,601 --> 00:10:26,813
but I'm walking on eggshells around you.

131
00:10:28,022 --> 00:10:30,233
You're making me feel sorry for no reason.

132
00:10:31,067 --> 00:10:32,568
What is this?

133
00:10:33,194 --> 00:10:34,320
How uncomfortable.

134
00:10:55,758 --> 00:10:57,718
What are you doing out here in the cold?

135
00:11:00,388 --> 00:11:01,681
You'll catch a cold.

136
00:11:03,307 --> 00:11:04,392
Thanks.

137
00:11:16,904 --> 00:11:17,947
Are you okay?

138
00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:21,200
No.

139
00:11:22,326 --> 00:11:23,411
I'm not.

140
00:11:24,412 --> 00:11:26,080
I feel so embarrassed…

141
00:11:27,999 --> 00:11:29,625
for getting my hopes up.

142
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,044
Pyeong-hwa.

143
00:11:33,337 --> 00:11:35,089
Do you remember what you said before?

144
00:11:36,632 --> 00:11:38,718
"I just like flying."

145
00:11:44,056 --> 00:11:45,057
I did.

146
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,935
And I still do.

147
00:11:49,437 --> 00:11:50,771
I heard that people confuse

148
00:11:50,855 --> 00:11:53,608
what they want to do
with what they want to become.

149
00:11:54,942 --> 00:11:59,071
Wasn't it your dream
to be a part of beautiful flights?

150
00:12:00,948 --> 00:12:02,450
If I become a purser,

151
00:12:03,451 --> 00:12:05,411
wouldn't my flights become more beautiful?

152
00:12:05,995 --> 00:12:07,371
You're already amazing.

153
00:12:09,123 --> 00:12:12,376
I want to become
a good flight attendant like you.

154
00:12:13,794 --> 00:12:14,879
Like me?

155
00:12:16,088 --> 00:12:18,007
Think about everything that's happened.

156
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,258
Look at me right now.

157
00:12:19,842 --> 00:12:20,926
I am looking.

158
00:12:21,802 --> 00:12:23,054
I always have.

159
00:12:24,513 --> 00:12:26,766
You always try your best
to help passengers

160
00:12:26,849 --> 00:12:28,768
have a safe and comfortable flight.

161
00:12:28,851 --> 00:12:30,895
Being the best flight attendant

162
00:12:32,355 --> 00:12:33,856
is much better

163
00:12:34,565 --> 00:12:35,816
than becoming a purser.

164
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,784
Thanks.

165
00:12:44,867 --> 00:12:46,369
It's not that comforting,

166
00:12:47,912 --> 00:12:49,205
but I'll try to cheer up.

167
00:13:05,888 --> 00:13:07,098
Let's walk.

168
00:14:04,321 --> 00:14:06,240
Why did you want to walk today?

169
00:14:06,323 --> 00:14:07,283
Isn't it great today?

170
00:14:07,366 --> 00:14:09,452
The weather's so nice
and I'm in a good mood.

171
00:14:09,535 --> 00:14:11,912
- There need to be days like this.
- How strange.

172
00:14:14,373 --> 00:14:16,208
What is this refreshing smell?

173
00:14:16,292 --> 00:14:18,919
- Did you spray cologne?
- Not "smell."

174
00:14:19,003 --> 00:14:20,004
"Scent."

175
00:14:20,087 --> 00:14:21,005
Scent.

176
00:14:21,088 --> 00:14:22,006
Perfume.

177
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,716
Jeez.

178
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:25,092
Why do you care?

179
00:14:25,176 --> 00:14:27,011
- Hello, sir.
- Yes, hello.

180
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:29,513
Mr. Gu.

181
00:14:29,597 --> 00:14:31,766
He's the longest-working employee
at King Hotel.

182
00:14:31,849 --> 00:14:32,725
Thirty years.

183
00:14:34,351 --> 00:14:37,229
- Once you leave, make a left.
- Okay.

184
00:14:37,313 --> 00:14:38,606
He is amazing.

185
00:14:44,195 --> 00:14:45,279
Thirty years?

186
00:14:46,947 --> 00:14:47,948
What's wrong?

187
00:14:50,034 --> 00:14:51,452
It's nothing.

188
00:14:56,332 --> 00:14:57,249
Hello.

189
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,542
It's a good morning.

190
00:14:58,626 --> 00:14:59,710
Yes.

191
00:14:59,794 --> 00:15:01,128
It is a good morning.

192
00:15:02,088 --> 00:15:03,589
Today is going to be a good day.

193
00:15:05,925 --> 00:15:07,468
"It's a good morning"?

194
00:15:25,986 --> 00:15:26,821
Don't.

195
00:15:36,664 --> 00:15:37,498
What's this?

196
00:15:37,581 --> 00:15:38,749
Why do you look so happy?

197
00:15:40,084 --> 00:15:41,210
You're mistaken.

198
00:15:41,293 --> 00:15:43,754
No, I'm not. There's definitely something.

199
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,589
Right, Sa-rang?

200
00:15:45,673 --> 00:15:47,133
I'm not sure.

201
00:15:47,758 --> 00:15:49,051
Face forward.

202
00:15:49,135 --> 00:15:50,469
Why are you not sure?

203
00:15:50,553 --> 00:15:51,637
That's strange.

204
00:16:10,656 --> 00:16:12,199
Something's off.

205
00:16:12,283 --> 00:16:14,451
You're grinning from ear to ear.
You look crazy.

206
00:16:14,535 --> 00:16:15,786
Cut the nonsense.

207
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,079
Get off.

208
00:16:23,627 --> 00:16:25,838
- Why aren't you getting off?
- I'll accompany you.

209
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:27,965
I can go by myself.

210
00:16:28,048 --> 00:16:29,717
I don't want to send you alone.

211
00:16:35,431 --> 00:16:36,515
People can see us.

212
00:16:36,599 --> 00:16:38,517
Then I can just cover our hands.

213
00:16:41,437 --> 00:16:42,605
They can't see now.

214
00:16:56,076 --> 00:16:56,952
Only up to here.

215
00:16:57,036 --> 00:16:58,078
No further.

216
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:03,459
Fine.

217
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:04,710
I'm only allowing it this once.

218
00:17:04,793 --> 00:17:06,086
You can't do this next time.

219
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,672
Okay.

220
00:17:19,767 --> 00:17:22,186
I don't think you understood me.

221
00:17:33,948 --> 00:17:34,907
Go inside.

222
00:17:37,493 --> 00:17:38,452
Okay.

223
00:18:04,478 --> 00:18:05,479
He's so cool.

224
00:18:06,021 --> 00:18:07,815
I'm going to work hard today!

225
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,793
He ordered coffee.

226
00:18:29,295 --> 00:18:30,296
What's going on?

227
00:18:30,879 --> 00:18:32,798
Why isn't he leaving?

228
00:18:33,382 --> 00:18:36,593
I think he's here
to observe how hard we're working.

229
00:18:37,636 --> 00:18:39,054
You're right. That's it.

230
00:18:39,138 --> 00:18:41,348
It's giving me chills.
I thought he was better than this.

231
00:18:41,432 --> 00:18:42,599
He's watching again.

232
00:18:48,063 --> 00:18:50,899
He keeps glancing our way.

233
00:18:50,983 --> 00:18:52,026
You're right.

234
00:18:52,109 --> 00:18:53,652
He's here to keep an eye on us.

235
00:18:56,613 --> 00:18:57,948
Sa-rang, go check on him.

236
00:18:59,033 --> 00:19:01,618
- What do you mean?
- Check to see if he needs anything.

237
00:19:01,702 --> 00:19:03,329
Find out why he's acting like that.

238
00:19:03,412 --> 00:19:04,663
Gauge his mood.

239
00:19:05,914 --> 00:19:07,499
- Hurry up.
- Hurry up.

240
00:19:10,169 --> 00:19:11,003
All right.

241
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:27,811
Mr. Gu,

242
00:19:28,479 --> 00:19:31,190
is there anything else
I can help you with?

243
00:19:31,273 --> 00:19:32,107
No, I'm fine.

244
00:19:32,608 --> 00:19:35,402
Then why don't you consider leaving now?

245
00:19:35,486 --> 00:19:36,320
I don't want to.

246
00:19:37,821 --> 00:19:41,992
Everyone finds it uncomfortable
to see you sitting here.

247
00:19:42,618 --> 00:19:44,661
Don't mind me. Just continue working.

248
00:19:44,745 --> 00:19:45,829
Well…

249
00:19:51,835 --> 00:19:53,504
How are we supposed to do that

250
00:19:53,587 --> 00:19:55,547
when you're sitting here like this?

251
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,342
- I have a meeting here later.
- What time?

252
00:19:58,425 --> 00:19:59,343
At 5 p.m.

253
00:20:00,386 --> 00:20:02,179
It's 2 p.m. right now.

254
00:20:02,262 --> 00:20:03,639
Hurry up and leave.

255
00:20:03,722 --> 00:20:06,016
- I'll leave in a bit.
- Can you just leave now?

256
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,310
Come on. It's because I want to see you.

257
00:20:08,394 --> 00:20:09,728
Mr. Gu!

258
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,907
We are at work right now.

259
00:20:23,325 --> 00:20:24,993
- You need to leave.
- But…

260
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:29,706
Did you have to get so serious?

261
00:20:30,624 --> 00:20:34,002
No one can work properly because of you,

262
00:20:34,086 --> 00:20:35,295
including me.

263
00:20:40,926 --> 00:20:41,760
Fine.

264
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,972
After just one more cup.

265
00:20:46,181 --> 00:20:47,933
You already had three.

266
00:20:48,016 --> 00:20:49,935
I think it'd be best for you to leave now.

267
00:20:53,647 --> 00:20:54,690
Hurry.

268
00:20:56,024 --> 00:20:57,276
Is that what you want?

269
00:20:58,610 --> 00:20:59,445
Yes.

270
00:21:00,446 --> 00:21:01,530
I beg you.

271
00:21:02,364 --> 00:21:03,240
"Beg"?

272
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,042
Okay.

273
00:21:15,002 --> 00:21:17,004
I'll disappear as you wish.

274
00:21:41,761 --> 00:21:43,805
Hi, do you know if there's any
good Korean restaurants

275
00:21:43,888 --> 00:21:45,223
for foreigners in Gwanghwamun?

276
00:21:46,308 --> 00:21:47,350
- Gwanghwamun?
- Yes.

277
00:21:47,434 --> 00:21:49,769
I'm sorry,
I don't know much about the area.

278
00:21:51,354 --> 00:21:54,149
Would you be okay
if I recommend some restaurants

279
00:21:54,232 --> 00:21:55,817
around here instead?

280
00:21:56,318 --> 00:21:58,653
No, my meeting is at Gwanghwamun.

281
00:22:10,498 --> 00:22:13,168
VEGAN RESTAURANTS

282
00:22:13,251 --> 00:22:14,502
MUST-EAT RESTAURANTS NEAR NAMSAN

283
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,923
MUST-EAT RESTAURANTS NEAR GWANGHWAMUN

284
00:22:21,384 --> 00:22:22,385
Sir,

285
00:22:22,469 --> 00:22:24,596
there is a place called
Gwanghwamun Hanjeongsik

286
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:26,806
which is popular to global customers.

287
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:29,100
Would you like me
to make a reservation for you?

288
00:22:29,184 --> 00:22:30,435
Yes, absolutely.

289
00:22:30,518 --> 00:22:32,312
For three at seven tonight.

290
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:35,050
Okay. I will make a reservation for
tonight at seven,

291
00:22:35,565 --> 00:22:37,108
three people under your name, sir.

292
00:22:37,192 --> 00:22:38,401
Great, thanks. What's your name?

293
00:22:38,485 --> 00:22:40,362
- May name is Se-ho.
- Se-ho? I appreciate it.

294
00:22:40,445 --> 00:22:41,404
Bye.

295
00:22:50,205 --> 00:22:51,414
"Thank you"

296
00:22:51,498 --> 00:22:54,584
must be an expression
to use at times like this.

297
00:22:54,667 --> 00:22:55,710
Don't mention it.

298
00:22:56,211 --> 00:22:58,380
Thank yourself
for your great service skills.

299
00:22:59,089 --> 00:23:01,424
- You're the best.
- That's true.

300
00:23:02,801 --> 00:23:05,053
But what was that notebook earlier?

301
00:23:05,887 --> 00:23:07,889
It had the restaurants'
most popular dishes,

302
00:23:07,972 --> 00:23:10,892
their locations, and notes about
the employees' foreign language skills.

303
00:23:10,975 --> 00:23:12,644
When I worked in the lobby,
a lot of foreign guests

304
00:23:12,727 --> 00:23:14,604
asked for restaurant recommendations.

305
00:23:14,687 --> 00:23:17,399
I created the list by touring
good restaurants on my days off.

306
00:23:18,274 --> 00:23:19,275
Mad respect.

307
00:23:20,026 --> 00:23:21,694
You're the best talent for a reason.

308
00:23:22,195 --> 00:23:23,488
I'm seeing you in a new light.

309
00:23:23,571 --> 00:23:25,949
Attention to detail is important
in customer service.

310
00:23:27,158 --> 00:23:28,993
I'll leave this here.

311
00:23:29,077 --> 00:23:30,995
You can look at it whenever you need to.

312
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:32,205
Is that okay?

313
00:23:32,288 --> 00:23:34,332
You're giving away
your efforts and know-how.

314
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:36,209
What's wrong with that?

315
00:23:36,292 --> 00:23:37,544
Our team will be using it.

316
00:23:38,128 --> 00:23:39,796
We're all one family.

317
00:23:54,436 --> 00:23:57,856
Is the 100th-anniversary event preparation
going smoothly?

318
00:23:57,939 --> 00:23:59,691
Yes, everything's going smoothly.

319
00:23:59,774 --> 00:24:01,025
Can you elaborate?

320
00:24:01,985 --> 00:24:03,653
This isn't just any event.

321
00:24:03,736 --> 00:24:06,156
King Hotel is the root of King Group.

322
00:24:06,239 --> 00:24:09,492
This year, we're honoring
the past 100 years of the group's history,

323
00:24:09,576 --> 00:24:11,286
as well as presenting our new vision.

324
00:24:11,369 --> 00:24:12,203
I know.

325
00:24:12,287 --> 00:24:14,164
We also need to invite public officials,

326
00:24:14,247 --> 00:24:15,915
but you haven't reached out to them yet.

327
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:21,254
They're not the type of people
to come on short notice.

328
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,882
Hwa-ran is right about that.

329
00:24:23,965 --> 00:24:27,886
You need finesse when approaching
people who work for the government.

330
00:24:28,636 --> 00:24:31,139
Your sister has that network
in her pocket.

331
00:24:31,222 --> 00:24:32,348
Ask her for help.

332
00:24:33,224 --> 00:24:34,684
You entrusted me with it.

333
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,394
I can handle it.

334
00:24:36,478 --> 00:24:38,480
You haven't even gotten anything done.

335
00:24:39,939 --> 00:24:42,108
King the Land is hosting this event.

336
00:24:42,192 --> 00:24:44,694
So everything is up to me.

337
00:24:44,777 --> 00:24:47,071
No, it's a matter of the hotel.

338
00:24:48,323 --> 00:24:51,576
King Hotel's capabilities
are to be displayed through this event.

339
00:24:55,538 --> 00:24:56,539
You're right.

340
00:24:57,207 --> 00:24:59,751
The entire hotel needs to be involved.

341
00:25:09,177 --> 00:25:10,261
Then from now on,

342
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:13,598
I will take charge of the hotel.

343
00:25:21,648 --> 00:25:24,108
Your sister is in charge
of King Air and Distribution,

344
00:25:24,192 --> 00:25:25,985
so you can manage the hotel.

345
00:25:26,069 --> 00:25:27,320
However,

346
00:25:27,403 --> 00:25:29,364
you have to show me
what you're capable of.

347
00:25:29,447 --> 00:25:31,991
Once the 100th-anniversary event is over,

348
00:25:32,867 --> 00:25:34,035
let's talk again.

349
00:25:51,469 --> 00:25:54,180
Mr. Gu, would you like some more coffee?

350
00:25:55,515 --> 00:25:56,558
Absolutely not.

351
00:26:42,937 --> 00:26:44,731
I need to have a word with you.

352
00:26:51,487 --> 00:26:53,698
I thought you didn't want to
talk to me at work.

353
00:26:55,325 --> 00:26:56,409
By any chance,

354
00:26:58,453 --> 00:26:59,537
are you upset?

355
00:26:59,621 --> 00:27:00,622
As if.

356
00:27:01,247 --> 00:27:02,665
I'm not that petty.

357
00:27:02,749 --> 00:27:05,126
Please. You're sulking.

358
00:27:06,669 --> 00:27:07,629
What are you saying?

359
00:27:08,171 --> 00:27:10,632
I'm just trying
not to mix business with pleasure.

360
00:27:11,299 --> 00:27:12,133
As you asked.

361
00:27:13,801 --> 00:27:15,053
Goodness.

362
00:27:15,136 --> 00:27:18,306
I had no choice but to do that earlier.

363
00:27:18,389 --> 00:27:20,224
Please. You begged me to leave.

364
00:27:20,308 --> 00:27:22,018
Come on. Don't sulk over that.

365
00:27:22,101 --> 00:27:22,977
Stop.

366
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:30,860
Don't be upset.

367
00:27:35,657 --> 00:27:36,699
I mean…

368
00:27:39,994 --> 00:27:41,871
- That's not--
- Forget it.

369
00:27:41,954 --> 00:27:43,206
- But--
- I'll make sure

370
00:27:43,289 --> 00:27:45,458
not to mix business with pleasure either.

371
00:27:45,541 --> 00:27:47,335
I understand what you mean.

372
00:27:47,418 --> 00:27:49,170
- But--
- Let's talk again next time.

373
00:27:51,214 --> 00:27:52,131
But…

374
00:27:56,219 --> 00:27:58,805
Can you do that one more time?

375
00:28:02,517 --> 00:28:03,559
This is bad.

376
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,398
This is bad.

377
00:28:11,401 --> 00:28:12,860
Mr. Gu!

378
00:28:15,113 --> 00:28:16,614
- You're the--
- Get out.

379
00:28:17,824 --> 00:28:19,992
You're the best. You're the man.

380
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:22,537
That is who you are.

381
00:28:23,246 --> 00:28:24,580
What are you saying?

382
00:28:24,664 --> 00:28:26,833
I heard you finally declared war
against Ms. Gu.

383
00:28:26,916 --> 00:28:29,293
"I will take charge of the hotel."

384
00:28:30,211 --> 00:28:31,295
You're so cool.

385
00:28:31,379 --> 00:28:33,464
You're awesome. Good job.

386
00:28:33,548 --> 00:28:34,757
This is just the start.

387
00:28:34,841 --> 00:28:37,635
I will be at the forefront.

388
00:28:41,639 --> 00:28:43,641
What? Why do you look so depressed?

389
00:28:43,725 --> 00:28:45,143
You were over the moon earlier.

390
00:28:45,226 --> 00:28:47,687
Why are you down in the dumps now?

391
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:48,855
What is it?

392
00:28:48,938 --> 00:28:49,897
What's wrong?

393
00:28:49,981 --> 00:28:51,357
It's nothing.

394
00:28:51,941 --> 00:28:53,234
I don't think so.

395
00:28:53,818 --> 00:28:55,653
Are you scared after drawing your sword?

396
00:28:56,404 --> 00:28:58,072
It's nothing like that.

397
00:28:59,365 --> 00:29:02,285
Then is it a relationship problem?

398
00:29:02,368 --> 00:29:04,078
Do you need my advice?

399
00:29:12,295 --> 00:29:13,963
- This is about someone I know.
- Okay.

400
00:29:14,047 --> 00:29:15,923
He argued with his girlfriend at work.

401
00:29:16,007 --> 00:29:19,427
The reason being his girlfriend told him
to stay away from her at work.

402
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:21,054
So the man got a little upset.

403
00:29:21,137 --> 00:29:22,638
- Yes.
- But what I don't understand

404
00:29:22,722 --> 00:29:25,391
is that when the girlfriend
hugged him from behind

405
00:29:25,475 --> 00:29:27,393
to cheer him up,

406
00:29:27,477 --> 00:29:29,395
the guy shuddered.

407
00:29:29,979 --> 00:29:31,189
He actually loved it

408
00:29:31,814 --> 00:29:33,441
but pushed her away
because he was startled.

409
00:29:33,524 --> 00:29:35,568
Why did he get startled? What an idiot.

410
00:29:35,651 --> 00:29:37,320
He must know nothing about dating.

411
00:29:38,404 --> 00:29:39,238
I <i>do</i> know!

412
00:29:42,742 --> 00:29:43,826
Leave for the day.

413
00:29:46,412 --> 00:29:49,373
At this rate, you could end up
losing everything to Mr. Gu.

414
00:29:49,457 --> 00:29:53,628
Mr. Gu's greatest weapon
should not be taken lightly.

415
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:55,004
What weapon?

416
00:29:55,088 --> 00:29:56,464
The fact that he's his son.

417
00:30:01,677 --> 00:30:03,638
I received an urgent message from the US.

418
00:30:03,721 --> 00:30:05,181
They said they couldn't reach you.

419
00:30:05,264 --> 00:30:06,140
Later.

420
00:30:06,224 --> 00:30:08,476
It seems it's something urgent
regarding your son, Ji-hu.

421
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,144
Did you not hear me?

422
00:30:10,978 --> 00:30:12,980
Understood, ma'am.

423
00:30:17,777 --> 00:30:19,445
Are you worried, Mr. Choi?

424
00:30:20,071 --> 00:30:21,781
Yes, slightly.

425
00:30:22,949 --> 00:30:24,075
Do you not trust me?

426
00:30:25,409 --> 00:30:26,327
It's not that.

427
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:27,495
Then,

428
00:30:28,371 --> 00:30:29,455
why are you worried?

429
00:30:31,249 --> 00:30:32,917
King Group was mine from the start.

430
00:30:34,168 --> 00:30:36,170
And it's going to stay that way.

431
00:30:36,254 --> 00:30:39,173
I'm not going to let Won have any of it.

432
00:30:41,425 --> 00:30:42,718
I'm sorry, ma'am.

433
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:47,557
Send invitations
to the people on our side.

434
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,976
Are you thinking of helping Mr. Gu?

435
00:30:50,059 --> 00:30:51,686
Why would I help him?

436
00:30:51,769 --> 00:30:54,230
Won may be in charge of the event,

437
00:30:54,856 --> 00:30:58,234
but it's going to be
full of people on my side.

438
00:30:59,527 --> 00:31:03,239
Won will be in charge in name only.

439
00:31:04,532 --> 00:31:05,700
Do you understand?

440
00:31:49,619 --> 00:31:50,703
I'm here, ma'am.

441
00:31:50,786 --> 00:31:51,829
Goodness gracious.

442
00:31:51,913 --> 00:31:54,498
What brings you all the way here?

443
00:31:54,582 --> 00:31:55,666
Well…

444
00:31:56,792 --> 00:31:58,169
Oh dear.

445
00:31:58,252 --> 00:31:59,128
Be careful!

446
00:32:04,217 --> 00:32:05,176
Goodness.

447
00:32:05,259 --> 00:32:07,428
GENERAL MEDICAL CENTER

448
00:32:08,304 --> 00:32:09,847
Jeez, it's fine.

449
00:32:09,931 --> 00:32:11,098
Please lie down.

450
00:32:11,182 --> 00:32:14,477
Why did you bring me to the hospital
over something like this?

451
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,895
You must have money to burn.

452
00:32:16,562 --> 00:32:18,773
You could've been in big trouble.

453
00:32:18,856 --> 00:32:21,317
The cartilage has degenerated
in both of your knees.

454
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,985
How have you been walking all this time?

455
00:32:23,069 --> 00:32:25,696
With my two legs. How else?

456
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:29,158
It's normal for my joints
to act up at this age.

457
00:32:29,784 --> 00:32:31,535
It'd be weirder if they were healthy.

458
00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:33,412
Get out of my way. I'm leaving.

459
00:32:34,163 --> 00:32:36,624
- Didn't you hear what the doctor said?
- What?

460
00:32:36,707 --> 00:32:40,044
The doctor suggested getting
knee injections while you're here.

461
00:32:40,127 --> 00:32:43,798
And considering your age,
they wanted to run a few more tests.

462
00:32:43,881 --> 00:32:45,174
What about my restaurant?

463
00:32:45,258 --> 00:32:46,259
I'll take care of it.

464
00:32:46,342 --> 00:32:47,385
Goodness.

465
00:32:47,468 --> 00:32:50,179
You talk big for a guy
who can't even peel onions.

466
00:32:50,263 --> 00:32:51,264
Jeez.

467
00:32:54,725 --> 00:32:55,685
Ma'am,

468
00:32:56,644 --> 00:32:57,812
no matter what you say,

469
00:32:58,479 --> 00:33:02,108
until you receive injection treatment
and run all of your tests,

470
00:33:02,191 --> 00:33:03,776
you can't leave this hospital.

471
00:33:05,528 --> 00:33:07,405
I'll do what I can with your restaurant.

472
00:33:07,989 --> 00:33:09,240
All you have to do

473
00:33:10,241 --> 00:33:12,535
is take care of your health.

474
00:33:15,288 --> 00:33:16,122
What?

475
00:33:17,456 --> 00:33:19,041
How dare you glare at me?

476
00:33:21,585 --> 00:33:22,545
Look at you.

477
00:33:22,628 --> 00:33:25,840
I thought you were a sluggard,
but you're quite agile.

478
00:33:26,424 --> 00:33:27,466
Gosh.

479
00:33:28,467 --> 00:33:30,136
Why did you come all the way here anyway?

480
00:33:30,845 --> 00:33:31,804
Well…

481
00:33:33,055 --> 00:33:34,974
I just dropped in while I was passing by.

482
00:33:35,057 --> 00:33:37,893
You dropped in all the way from Seoul?

483
00:33:37,977 --> 00:33:39,270
I saw some flowers

484
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:42,398
and I thought of you.

485
00:33:42,481 --> 00:33:45,067
You should be thinking of
a woman you love.

486
00:33:45,901 --> 00:33:47,945
Why did you think of me?

487
00:33:49,196 --> 00:33:50,990
There must be something going on

488
00:33:51,657 --> 00:33:53,451
between you and Sa-rang.

489
00:33:55,953 --> 00:33:57,121
How did you know?

490
00:33:57,204 --> 00:33:58,539
I can just tell.

491
00:33:58,622 --> 00:34:00,624
It's written all over your face.

492
00:34:01,834 --> 00:34:04,670
You have feelings for Sa-rang, don't you?

493
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:13,971
Yes, I like Sa-rang.

494
00:34:14,555 --> 00:34:16,057
Then did you ask her out?

495
00:34:17,808 --> 00:34:20,227
Do I have to put it into words

496
00:34:21,103 --> 00:34:23,064
when we both know we like each other?

497
00:34:25,274 --> 00:34:26,192
Come over here.

498
00:34:26,275 --> 00:34:27,485
You can just tell me--

499
00:34:27,568 --> 00:34:28,694
Come over here!

500
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,327
The thing is,

501
00:34:37,078 --> 00:34:40,414
even if you feel
an emotional connection with someone,

502
00:34:40,915 --> 00:34:44,668
if you don't express
how you sincerely feel,

503
00:34:44,752 --> 00:34:46,379
it's likely they won't know.

504
00:34:47,671 --> 00:34:49,840
It's the same whether things are good

505
00:34:49,924 --> 00:34:51,759
or bad in your relationship.

506
00:34:52,718 --> 00:34:55,513
If something made you upset,

507
00:34:55,596 --> 00:34:58,641
just swallow your pride

508
00:34:59,642 --> 00:35:03,437
and tell each other what made you upset.

509
00:35:03,521 --> 00:35:06,607
You also have to listen with your heart.

510
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:09,360
That is how you should love one another.

511
00:35:09,443 --> 00:35:10,611
Do you understand?

512
00:35:13,948 --> 00:35:14,949
Yes.

513
00:35:15,783 --> 00:35:16,951
I'll keep that in mind.

514
00:35:18,077 --> 00:35:19,328
Okay. Here.

515
00:35:20,371 --> 00:35:23,457
First things first.
Sign up to be a candidate.

516
00:35:23,541 --> 00:35:25,376
A candidate for what?

517
00:35:25,459 --> 00:35:28,212
You'll be candidate number one
for Sa-rang's husband.

518
00:35:29,296 --> 00:35:32,716
I'll make a decision
after considering a few others.

519
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,468
But ma'am…

520
00:35:35,428 --> 00:35:36,429
Grandma.

521
00:35:38,597 --> 00:35:40,015
Grandma, are you okay?

522
00:35:40,099 --> 00:35:42,101
I'm fine. This is nothing.

523
00:35:43,394 --> 00:35:44,770
How bad is it? Where does it hurt?

524
00:35:44,854 --> 00:35:46,730
- Are you in a lot of pain?
- Goodness.

525
00:35:46,814 --> 00:35:49,608
I told you I'm fine. It's okay.

526
00:35:50,818 --> 00:35:53,070
Why, you little…

527
00:35:53,154 --> 00:35:55,156
You're so impatient.

528
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:58,242
I can't believe you told her already.

529
00:35:58,325 --> 00:36:00,786
What are you going to do
with that big mouth of yours?

530
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:03,998
You've been admitted,
so I had to contact your guardian.

531
00:36:04,081 --> 00:36:06,292
What? You're out.

532
00:36:06,375 --> 00:36:07,626
I disapprove.

533
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:08,919
You get out of my way too.

534
00:36:09,003 --> 00:36:11,172
- I'm getting up.
- Where are you going?

535
00:36:11,255 --> 00:36:13,424
I need to run my restaurant.

536
00:36:13,507 --> 00:36:15,509
Who cares about the restaurant right now?

537
00:36:16,552 --> 00:36:19,388
I told you to stop working.
I make money now.

538
00:36:19,472 --> 00:36:22,266
It's okay. I'm totally fine.

539
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:24,602
Are you going to keep worrying me?

540
00:36:24,685 --> 00:36:27,438
Do you know how I felt on my way here?

541
00:36:30,149 --> 00:36:31,275
Please.

542
00:36:31,942 --> 00:36:33,777
Didn't I tell you to let me know

543
00:36:34,445 --> 00:36:36,864
when you're sick
or going through a tough time?

544
00:36:39,116 --> 00:36:41,327
I can't live without you.

545
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:46,499
How am I supposed to live without you too?

546
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:52,087
Okay. All right.

547
00:36:52,171 --> 00:36:54,173
It's okay. Don't cry.

548
00:36:54,256 --> 00:36:56,800
I'll get all the treatments
and tests done,

549
00:36:57,384 --> 00:37:00,221
and I won't leave
until the doctor tells me I can.

550
00:37:00,304 --> 00:37:02,139
So stop crying. There, there.

551
00:37:04,433 --> 00:37:06,977
You promised to live longer than me.

552
00:37:07,061 --> 00:37:08,771
Stop it. I'm not dying.

553
00:37:09,813 --> 00:37:12,191
Where would I go without you?

554
00:37:12,775 --> 00:37:14,109
I won't go anywhere.

555
00:37:14,693 --> 00:37:17,279
So stop crying. Okay?

556
00:37:23,994 --> 00:37:25,246
There, there.

557
00:37:49,979 --> 00:37:51,230
Don't worry.

558
00:37:51,313 --> 00:37:52,523
She'll be okay.

559
00:37:53,065 --> 00:37:54,441
Her fall wasn't that bad.

560
00:37:55,526 --> 00:37:56,402
Thank you.

561
00:37:57,736 --> 00:37:59,238
You can go first.
I'll take care of the rest.

562
00:38:00,614 --> 00:38:01,657
Let's do it together.

563
00:38:02,283 --> 00:38:04,201
No, it's okay. I can just take a taxi.

564
00:38:04,285 --> 00:38:08,080
I promised your grandmother
to take you home safely.

565
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:10,165
Let's do it together.

566
00:38:23,178 --> 00:38:25,723
Don't we just have to
switch out the lightbulb?

567
00:38:25,806 --> 00:38:28,642
No. We first need to
completely cut off the electricity

568
00:38:28,726 --> 00:38:30,644
to ensure our safety.

569
00:38:32,146 --> 00:38:33,355
Have you done this before?

570
00:38:33,439 --> 00:38:34,815
Of course not.

571
00:38:36,317 --> 00:38:37,693
Then I'll just do it.

572
00:38:37,776 --> 00:38:38,736
No.

573
00:38:39,403 --> 00:38:40,446
I'll do it.

574
00:38:41,238 --> 00:38:42,323
Just trust me.

575
00:38:52,791 --> 00:38:54,376
- This…
- What did you do?

576
00:38:54,918 --> 00:38:58,964
All I did was place my finger there,
but all of a sudden…

577
00:38:59,048 --> 00:39:00,507
Wait. Do you have your phone?

578
00:39:00,591 --> 00:39:02,134
- Hold on.
- Where is it? Turn on the flashlight.

579
00:39:02,217 --> 00:39:03,552
My phone is…

580
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:05,304
in my car.

581
00:39:05,804 --> 00:39:07,848
- I put mine over there too.
- Hang on a second.

582
00:39:08,349 --> 00:39:09,725
- Which way is the exit?
- What do I do?

583
00:39:09,808 --> 00:39:10,976
- Okay, then let's…
- Where…

584
00:39:21,278 --> 00:39:22,404
Wait…

585
00:39:23,572 --> 00:39:25,824
- Should we go this way?
- I need to go that way.

586
00:39:25,908 --> 00:39:28,243
- Okay. I'll go.
- No, it's not that way.

587
00:39:28,327 --> 00:39:29,578
- Wait. Hold on.
- Gosh.

588
00:39:29,662 --> 00:39:31,330
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

589
00:39:31,413 --> 00:39:32,915
- Are you hurt?
- Freeze.

590
00:39:36,502 --> 00:39:39,254
Just stay still right here.

591
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:41,924
All right?

592
00:39:43,092 --> 00:39:44,051
All right.

593
00:39:45,052 --> 00:39:46,220
- But--
- Don't.

594
00:39:49,139 --> 00:39:50,224
Fine.

595
00:39:55,312 --> 00:39:56,772
What?

596
00:39:56,855 --> 00:39:59,274
Where are you?
Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

597
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:01,485
Where are you? Where in the world are you?

598
00:40:01,568 --> 00:40:02,861
- Right here.
- Oh my god!

599
00:40:02,945 --> 00:40:04,029
It's okay.

600
00:40:07,032 --> 00:40:08,909
- I'm not okay.
- What's wrong with you?

601
00:40:08,992 --> 00:40:10,077
Come on.

602
00:40:10,577 --> 00:40:12,246
Why are you always fainting?

603
00:40:12,329 --> 00:40:14,373
Get up. Seriously.

604
00:40:19,628 --> 00:40:21,380
You should go back now.

605
00:40:26,135 --> 00:40:27,469
Is that what you really want?

606
00:40:36,562 --> 00:40:37,688
I want to stay with you.

607
00:40:40,107 --> 00:40:41,358
Is it just me?

608
00:40:48,157 --> 00:40:49,199
No.

609
00:40:50,576 --> 00:40:51,702
I feel the same way.

610
00:40:59,752 --> 00:41:01,420
I'm sorry about yesterday.

611
00:41:02,963 --> 00:41:04,548
I can be so clueless sometimes.

612
00:41:06,759 --> 00:41:07,718
I guess

613
00:41:08,343 --> 00:41:10,262
I made a fuss

614
00:41:10,345 --> 00:41:13,599
because it felt like
you didn't miss me or like me back.

615
00:41:16,852 --> 00:41:18,312
Sorry for making you feel uncomfortable.

616
00:41:22,024 --> 00:41:24,234
I'm also sorry for snapping at you.

617
00:41:24,818 --> 00:41:26,904
I could've been more gentle,

618
00:41:27,529 --> 00:41:29,865
but I was worried about what
the others would think,

619
00:41:29,948 --> 00:41:31,575
so I was on edge.

620
00:41:34,328 --> 00:41:35,370
No.

621
00:41:36,455 --> 00:41:37,498
I'm sorry.

622
00:41:44,296 --> 00:41:45,339
I'm sorry too.

623
00:41:50,344 --> 00:41:53,180
If I ever make a mistake again,

624
00:41:53,722 --> 00:41:55,265
you can sulk all you want.

625
00:41:56,308 --> 00:41:57,726
I'll handle it.

626
00:41:59,102 --> 00:42:02,064
Even if it may take a while,
I'll make sure to cheer you up.

627
00:42:03,106 --> 00:42:04,775
So when you're with me,

628
00:42:05,692 --> 00:42:07,027
don't suppress your emotions.

629
00:42:08,612 --> 00:42:10,072
Just be yourself.

630
00:42:17,955 --> 00:42:19,122
Come to think of it,

631
00:42:21,333 --> 00:42:25,003
I don't think
I've ever expressed how I truly feel.

632
00:42:43,355 --> 00:42:46,984
I like you a lot.

633
00:42:56,118 --> 00:42:57,452
Will you accept my feelings?

634
00:44:01,642 --> 00:44:05,395
But do we have to stay
this far away from each other?

635
00:44:05,479 --> 00:44:06,939
This is my grandma's room.

636
00:44:08,065 --> 00:44:09,024
I know that.

637
00:44:09,107 --> 00:44:10,275
But…

638
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:13,612
You're so far away.

639
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,863
I can barely hear you.

640
00:44:15,739 --> 00:44:16,573
Hello?

641
00:44:17,699 --> 00:44:18,951
Can you hear me?

642
00:44:20,911 --> 00:44:24,748
Do you want to go to Seoul this instant
or do you want to sleep outside?

643
00:44:25,958 --> 00:44:27,042
Really?

644
00:44:28,335 --> 00:44:29,169
You're so adamant.

645
00:44:31,213 --> 00:44:33,423
We have to get up early tomorrow to prep.

646
00:44:33,924 --> 00:44:36,635
We only have three hours before then,
so go to sleep.

647
00:44:38,303 --> 00:44:39,262
Fine.

648
00:44:50,649 --> 00:44:51,775
- What was that?
- Let's sleep.

649
00:44:57,322 --> 00:44:58,573
Hurry up and go to sleep.

650
00:45:01,868 --> 00:45:02,911
It's our second time.

651
00:45:04,538 --> 00:45:05,580
What do you mean?

652
00:45:06,707 --> 00:45:07,916
Sleeping in the same room.

653
00:45:09,084 --> 00:45:10,627
Last time, there were two rooms.

654
00:45:10,711 --> 00:45:12,504
You were so snappy then.

655
00:45:12,587 --> 00:45:14,214
You were such a jerk then.

656
00:45:18,218 --> 00:45:19,678
Even though I kept

657
00:45:20,721 --> 00:45:22,389
giving you the death stare,

658
00:45:24,057 --> 00:45:25,183
on the inside,

659
00:45:26,184 --> 00:45:27,227
I was thinking, "What?"

660
00:45:28,228 --> 00:45:29,271
"Why do I like her?"

661
00:45:30,564 --> 00:45:31,898
"Why does she look cute?"

662
00:45:32,774 --> 00:45:33,692
Really.

663
00:45:36,194 --> 00:45:37,696
Come to think of it,

664
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:40,574
I liked everything about you
from the start.

665
00:45:46,747 --> 00:45:49,916
Thank you for liking everything about me.

666
00:45:58,175 --> 00:45:59,593
I'll always be next to you.

667
00:46:01,219 --> 00:46:03,013
I'll always be in your line of sight.

668
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:06,266
I'll always be

669
00:46:07,642 --> 00:46:08,810
within arm's reach.

670
00:46:17,319 --> 00:46:18,612
Now I can see you clearly.

671
00:46:23,492 --> 00:46:24,534
Let's sleep.

672
00:47:06,701 --> 00:47:07,911
This isn't…

673
00:47:09,037 --> 00:47:11,248
- Hey, you punk!
- Don't get the wrong idea, ma'am.

674
00:47:11,331 --> 00:47:12,749
I swear I didn't do anything.

675
00:47:12,833 --> 00:47:15,794
What? You didn't do anything?

676
00:47:15,877 --> 00:47:19,172
Yes, I swear. I only held her hand, ma'am.

677
00:47:19,256 --> 00:47:20,340
Why you little…

678
00:47:20,423 --> 00:47:22,843
- You punk.
- Why?

679
00:47:22,926 --> 00:47:24,386
- You idiot.
- What did I do?

680
00:47:24,469 --> 00:47:26,555
- You idiot. You call yourself a man?
- What?

681
00:47:26,638 --> 00:47:27,973
Are you a man, you punk?

682
00:47:28,056 --> 00:47:29,558
- Grandma.
- You just held her hand?

683
00:47:29,641 --> 00:47:30,809
Darn you.

684
00:47:36,982 --> 00:47:38,692
You're not going to the hospital?

685
00:47:39,609 --> 00:47:43,196
Why would I go back there
when I finished all of my treatments?

686
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,531
Then where are you going?

687
00:47:44,614 --> 00:47:46,283
I'll be back soon.

688
00:47:46,366 --> 00:47:47,993
You should peel the onions

689
00:47:48,076 --> 00:47:49,244
and get the fire ready.

690
00:47:49,327 --> 00:47:50,620
- Let's go.
- Yes, ma'am.

691
00:47:50,704 --> 00:47:51,872
You're taking him too?

692
00:47:52,998 --> 00:47:54,791
What's going on?

693
00:47:55,542 --> 00:47:56,835
- Hurry up.
- Yes, ma'am.

694
00:47:58,545 --> 00:47:59,963
Where are you going?

695
00:48:06,303 --> 00:48:07,679
Ms. Cha!

696
00:48:07,762 --> 00:48:08,972
Drink one of these.

697
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,396
Who is this?

698
00:48:16,479 --> 00:48:17,689
Your grandson-in-law?

699
00:48:17,772 --> 00:48:19,316
Don't be absurd.

700
00:48:19,399 --> 00:48:21,276
He's just one of the men
who chase after Sa-rang.

701
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:22,777
A candidate.

702
00:48:22,861 --> 00:48:23,987
I see.

703
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:25,322
You're so handsome.

704
00:48:25,405 --> 00:48:30,243
That's the least he can do
to be in Sa-rang's league.

705
00:48:30,327 --> 00:48:31,870
She's on another level.

706
00:48:31,953 --> 00:48:33,038
You're right.

707
00:48:33,622 --> 00:48:35,624
- Drink this.
- I'm okay.

708
00:48:35,707 --> 00:48:37,208
It's my treat. Just drink it.

709
00:48:37,792 --> 00:48:39,461
Thank you. I appreciate it.

710
00:48:40,795 --> 00:48:41,838
Sun-hui!

711
00:48:45,175 --> 00:48:46,885
I heard you went to the hospital.

712
00:48:48,637 --> 00:48:50,430
Have one of these for a swift recovery.

713
00:48:50,513 --> 00:48:51,348
Okay.

714
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:53,850
Who is he?

715
00:48:53,934 --> 00:48:56,186
- Her grandson-in-law?
- No.

716
00:48:56,269 --> 00:48:59,189
He's just one of the many men
who chase after Sa-rang.

717
00:48:59,272 --> 00:49:00,982
He's just a candidate.

718
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,114
So?

719
00:49:08,698 --> 00:49:10,617
How long have you chased after Sa-rang?

720
00:49:11,242 --> 00:49:13,244
- Well--
- By the way, do you have a job?

721
00:49:13,828 --> 00:49:16,998
- Yes, I--
- He works at the same hotel as Sa-rang.

722
00:49:17,582 --> 00:49:18,708
King Hotel.

723
00:49:18,792 --> 00:49:21,419
The best hotel in the country.

724
00:49:22,128 --> 00:49:25,006
It costs several hundred thousand won
for one night.

725
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,509
No matter how great the hotel is,

726
00:49:27,592 --> 00:49:29,886
it's still just a huge inn.

727
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:33,431
My grandson-in-law
works for a major company in Seoul.

728
00:49:33,515 --> 00:49:35,058
Goodness.

729
00:49:35,141 --> 00:49:37,936
A hotel is almost a major company.

730
00:49:38,019 --> 00:49:39,771
But do you own a house?

731
00:49:47,779 --> 00:49:50,323
I don't feel the need to yet.

732
00:49:50,407 --> 00:49:51,700
Goodness.

733
00:49:51,783 --> 00:49:55,370
I can't believe I'm hearing someone say
they don't need a house.

734
00:49:55,453 --> 00:49:57,872
It's not easy to buy a house in Seoul.

735
00:49:57,956 --> 00:50:00,959
He can take his time.
Why are you worried about his house?

736
00:50:01,042 --> 00:50:02,002
It's okay.

737
00:50:02,085 --> 00:50:06,214
My grandson-in-law bought a house.

738
00:50:06,297 --> 00:50:07,549
He's only paid off half the mortgage.

739
00:50:09,718 --> 00:50:10,927
You're all chatting again?

740
00:50:11,011 --> 00:50:12,429
Aren't you going to work?

741
00:50:20,854 --> 00:50:22,605
- Eat it with this.
- Thank you.

742
00:50:22,689 --> 00:50:23,940
- Enjoy.
- Hey, my daughter-in-law.

743
00:50:24,024 --> 00:50:25,275
- Yes?
- More radish kimchi, please.

744
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:26,776
Okay. Radish kimchi.

745
00:50:30,071 --> 00:50:31,698
Where did they go?

746
00:50:36,661 --> 00:50:38,788
What do you like about Sa-rang?

747
00:50:40,957 --> 00:50:42,083
Just everything.

748
00:50:42,667 --> 00:50:43,918
There's nothing I dislike about her.

749
00:50:44,002 --> 00:50:46,963
Do you know how long Sa-rang lived here?

750
00:50:47,547 --> 00:50:49,215
She used to live here?

751
00:50:49,299 --> 00:50:50,967
Since when?

752
00:50:51,468 --> 00:50:53,178
I ask the questions.

753
00:50:53,261 --> 00:50:54,387
You just answer.

754
00:50:55,305 --> 00:50:56,139
Yes, ma'am.

755
00:50:56,723 --> 00:50:59,517
What's Sa-rang's favorite food?

756
00:51:02,687 --> 00:51:03,730
She doesn't like raw fish.

757
00:51:03,813 --> 00:51:05,899
Did I ask you what she doesn't like?

758
00:51:05,982 --> 00:51:08,234
I asked you what she likes.

759
00:51:09,694 --> 00:51:13,573
I will find out one by one.

760
00:51:16,117 --> 00:51:18,119
If you like her,

761
00:51:18,203 --> 00:51:20,914
you should first find out
what kind of life she's lived

762
00:51:20,997 --> 00:51:22,415
and what kind of person she is.

763
00:51:22,499 --> 00:51:23,958
How can you just declare you like her

764
00:51:24,042 --> 00:51:25,835
when you don't know anything about her?

765
00:51:26,795 --> 00:51:30,006
You don't pass as Sa-rang's partner.

766
00:51:33,259 --> 00:51:34,260
Get up.

767
00:51:35,261 --> 00:51:37,514
YANGGIL BANK

768
00:51:37,597 --> 00:51:38,973
- Hello, ma'am.
- Yes.

769
00:51:44,771 --> 00:51:47,732
This must be the man
who's been chasing after Sa-rang, right?

770
00:51:47,816 --> 00:51:49,234
Your potential grandson-in-law.

771
00:51:49,734 --> 00:51:51,194
Yes, that's me.

772
00:51:52,779 --> 00:51:54,864
Ms. Cha is a hard nut to crack.

773
00:51:54,948 --> 00:51:56,199
You're in for a rough ride.

774
00:51:57,158 --> 00:51:58,368
What can I help you with?

775
00:51:58,451 --> 00:51:59,953
Another savings account?

776
00:52:00,036 --> 00:52:01,746
A housing subscription account.

777
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:03,123
Really? Why?

778
00:52:03,206 --> 00:52:04,415
You already have a house.

779
00:52:04,499 --> 00:52:06,751
It's not for me. It's for him.

780
00:52:07,627 --> 00:52:09,921
This is for the first month.

781
00:52:10,004 --> 00:52:12,173
Starting next month,
you make the deposits.

782
00:52:14,384 --> 00:52:16,678
You're already taking care of
your grandson-in-law.

783
00:52:16,761 --> 00:52:18,763
You're so loving, ma'am.

784
00:52:18,847 --> 00:52:20,765
Grandson-in-law, my foot.

785
00:52:20,849 --> 00:52:22,600
He's just a candidate.

786
00:52:24,644 --> 00:52:26,604
Is this your first time at a bank?

787
00:52:26,688 --> 00:52:28,064
Your ID.

788
00:52:28,148 --> 00:52:29,816
Right. Yes, ma'am.

789
00:52:32,777 --> 00:52:33,778
Here you go.

790
00:52:34,988 --> 00:52:36,865
Please wait here. I'll make a quick copy.

791
00:52:41,661 --> 00:52:43,037
Thank you, ma'am.

792
00:52:44,122 --> 00:52:45,415
I'll save a lot of money.

793
00:52:45,498 --> 00:52:47,333
You don't need a house right now.

794
00:52:48,084 --> 00:52:51,296
You and Sa-rang
can work hard and save money.

795
00:52:51,379 --> 00:52:53,882
Don't let something like that
get you down.

796
00:52:54,924 --> 00:52:56,801
Just work hard

797
00:52:56,885 --> 00:52:59,137
and live a good life. Okay?

798
00:53:01,514 --> 00:53:05,602
Then are you finally
giving me your approval?

799
00:53:07,687 --> 00:53:09,731
Didn't you hear me?

800
00:53:09,814 --> 00:53:11,566
You're no good.

801
00:53:11,649 --> 00:53:12,734
You don't pass.

802
00:53:18,907 --> 00:53:20,700
Wow, what's all this?

803
00:53:20,783 --> 00:53:22,368
Is this a feast?

804
00:53:22,452 --> 00:53:25,205
I just prepared the usual dishes
with not much effort.

805
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:27,373
Eat up.

806
00:53:27,457 --> 00:53:28,458
Thank you.

807
00:53:32,587 --> 00:53:34,255
Grandma's food is the best.

808
00:53:34,797 --> 00:53:36,883
- So don't be sick.
- Okay.

809
00:53:36,966 --> 00:53:39,385
Hey, eat this first.

810
00:53:40,428 --> 00:53:42,639
I asked them to give me their best cut.

811
00:53:42,722 --> 00:53:45,850
But I'm not sure
if it'll be tender and juicy.

812
00:53:45,934 --> 00:53:47,769
- Thank you.
- Sure.

813
00:53:53,066 --> 00:53:55,652
Here. You should try it too.

814
00:53:57,654 --> 00:53:58,488
It's amazing.

815
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,531
- Is that so?
- Yes.

816
00:54:00,615 --> 00:54:02,909
- You should have some too.
- Okay, I will.

817
00:54:08,623 --> 00:54:09,666
It's so good.

818
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:11,834
Please eat.

819
00:54:11,918 --> 00:54:13,002
Okay.

820
00:54:20,468 --> 00:54:24,931
She told me I was the number one candidate
for grandson-in-law.

821
00:54:25,014 --> 00:54:27,016
Is that why she cooked for you?

822
00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:28,685
How odd.

823
00:54:29,644 --> 00:54:30,687
By the way,

824
00:54:33,022 --> 00:54:34,315
what's your favorite food?

825
00:54:37,402 --> 00:54:38,486
Maybe spring rolls?

826
00:54:38,569 --> 00:54:39,612
That's it?

827
00:54:40,321 --> 00:54:42,740
What do you mean?
Spring rolls are amazing.

828
00:54:44,325 --> 00:54:46,494
- What about you?
- I'll go with spring rolls too.

829
00:54:47,328 --> 00:54:48,746
- What?
- I mean,

830
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:52,125
you're the person I like.

831
00:54:52,208 --> 00:54:53,710
So I like what you like.

832
00:54:54,502 --> 00:54:55,962
Let's go eat them sometime.

833
00:54:56,462 --> 00:54:57,338
Okay.

834
00:55:03,636 --> 00:55:05,179
Should we take one more lap?

835
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:09,350
I think we've taken over ten laps already.

836
00:55:10,018 --> 00:55:11,060
Then…

837
00:55:12,478 --> 00:55:14,022
we can just make it 20.

838
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,194
I'll allow it.

839
00:55:22,322 --> 00:55:23,406
Let's go.

840
00:55:25,283 --> 00:55:26,326
Sa-rang!

841
00:55:29,746 --> 00:55:30,955
Where are you coming from?

842
00:55:31,706 --> 00:55:32,623
What's up?

843
00:55:33,791 --> 00:55:35,543
Goodness. Mr. No.

844
00:55:36,586 --> 00:55:37,795
Mr. No?

845
00:55:40,131 --> 00:55:41,299
It's really him.

846
00:55:47,847 --> 00:55:49,307
What is all of this?

847
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:51,351
I'm going to drink like a fish tonight.

848
00:55:51,851 --> 00:55:54,479
She can't survive right now
without drinking.

849
00:55:54,562 --> 00:55:56,606
Why? Did something happen?

850
00:55:57,231 --> 00:55:59,067
You know what an incentive trip is, right?

851
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:01,611
We reached our goal
after working our butts off for a month.

852
00:56:02,487 --> 00:56:04,489
But they sent us on a day trip to Bali.

853
00:56:04,572 --> 00:56:06,366
A day trip to Bali?

854
00:56:06,449 --> 00:56:07,408
Yes.

855
00:56:07,492 --> 00:56:08,743
I just got back.

856
00:56:22,632 --> 00:56:23,966
Hey!

857
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:25,968
You ruined my hair.

858
00:56:26,552 --> 00:56:28,596
Good grief.

859
00:56:28,679 --> 00:56:29,597
I'm sorry.

860
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,099
Do you want to check these?

861
00:56:34,894 --> 00:56:36,562
There's nothing special about Bali.

862
00:56:37,063 --> 00:56:40,191
With a beach and a palm tree,
we're basically there.

863
00:56:40,817 --> 00:56:43,694
YOU BETTER BALI-VE IT

864
00:56:43,778 --> 00:56:46,030
So you're saying we can't go?

865
00:56:46,114 --> 00:56:47,323
Yes, that's right.

866
00:56:47,407 --> 00:56:49,158
This time, we can settle for this.

867
00:56:49,242 --> 00:56:50,701
We'll go to Thailand next time.

868
00:56:50,785 --> 00:56:54,664
You said we'd go to Southeast Asia
if we reached 30%.

869
00:56:54,747 --> 00:56:58,626
We worked our butts off
without any bathroom breaks.

870
00:56:58,709 --> 00:56:59,794
Tell me about it.

871
00:56:59,877 --> 00:57:04,048
Next time, I'll do whatever it takes
to get you girls a trip to Thailand.

872
00:57:04,132 --> 00:57:06,175
So let's increase the sales a little more.

873
00:57:06,259 --> 00:57:07,385
Ms. Do.

874
00:57:07,468 --> 00:57:09,387
We came somewhere nice.

875
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:12,306
Don't ruin the mood.
Let's talk about good things only.

876
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:15,810
I've been to Bali before.
It's identical to this place.

877
00:57:16,519 --> 00:57:18,521
It's a waste of time to fly there!

878
00:57:19,063 --> 00:57:19,897
Hey.

879
00:57:21,107 --> 00:57:22,024
The special effects.

880
00:57:24,902 --> 00:57:26,028
Is this good?

881
00:57:26,112 --> 00:57:28,030
- Yes.
- Keep smiling.

882
00:57:28,114 --> 00:57:29,949
Nice. Wonderful.

883
00:57:30,032 --> 00:57:31,117
- You look like Lee Hyo-ri.
- Me?

884
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,535
<i>That's the worst.</i>

885
00:57:32,618 --> 00:57:33,953
She's so evil.

886
00:57:34,579 --> 00:57:36,456
She's just like my supervisor.

887
00:57:36,539 --> 00:57:37,915
What did your supervisor do?

888
00:57:38,624 --> 00:57:40,877
She promised to make Pyeong-hwa a purser

889
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,045
if she increased sales,
so she made her team first.

890
00:57:43,129 --> 00:57:45,173
But instead,
she promoted Pyeong-hwa's junior,

891
00:57:45,256 --> 00:57:46,507
her favorite.

892
00:57:46,591 --> 00:57:50,261
She wouldn't have worked to the point of
hurting her back had she known.

893
00:57:50,344 --> 00:57:53,598
Are in-flight sales
that important for becoming a purser?

894
00:57:53,681 --> 00:57:57,101
They bring in a lot of money
thanks to their high profit margin.

895
00:57:57,602 --> 00:57:59,479
The company keeps pushing us.

896
00:57:59,562 --> 00:58:01,689
If your team doesn't reach
its monthly sales target,

897
00:58:01,773 --> 00:58:02,982
you'll get a poor performance rating.

898
00:58:03,065 --> 00:58:05,610
Are there any incentives
for selling a lot?

899
00:58:05,693 --> 00:58:07,195
No, there aren't.

900
00:58:07,278 --> 00:58:08,780
If I do well, it's a given.

901
00:58:08,863 --> 00:58:10,907
If I do poorly,
I get on my superiors' bad side.

902
00:58:11,991 --> 00:58:13,868
What do you expect from King Group?

903
00:58:13,951 --> 00:58:16,954
Even Sa-rang was chosen
as the best talent for two years straight,

904
00:58:17,038 --> 00:58:19,081
but all she was given was
a smiley face badge.

905
00:58:19,874 --> 00:58:21,083
Hold on.

906
00:58:21,876 --> 00:58:25,421
You were chosen as the best talent
for two consecutive years,

907
00:58:25,505 --> 00:58:26,756
but all you got was a badge?

908
00:58:27,632 --> 00:58:29,675
Since it was two years, I got two badges.

909
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:32,428
I wasn't expecting anything, so it's okay.

910
00:58:32,512 --> 00:58:35,097
It's not okay.
You always say that with everything.

911
00:58:35,181 --> 00:58:37,350
What can I do if it's not okay?

912
00:58:41,646 --> 00:58:43,481
So the best talent only got a badge.

913
00:58:44,065 --> 00:58:46,526
Da-eul, even after reaching your goal,

914
00:58:46,609 --> 00:58:48,611
you weren't given the trip
you were promised.

915
00:58:48,694 --> 00:58:52,907
Pyeong-hwa, you were promised a promotion
if your team came in first,

916
00:58:52,990 --> 00:58:54,283
but someone else got it.

917
00:58:55,618 --> 00:58:57,203
It's my fault for being so naive.

918
00:58:58,079 --> 00:58:59,539
Why in the world…

919
00:58:59,622 --> 00:59:02,041
The company should recognize
and reward its employees.

920
00:59:02,124 --> 00:59:04,085
Also, a superior not keeping their word?

921
00:59:04,168 --> 00:59:07,797
How does it make sense
for a superior to break their promise?

922
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:08,756
It does.

923
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:11,259
The higher-ups only look up.

924
00:59:11,342 --> 00:59:13,177
They don't care about us.

925
00:59:13,261 --> 00:59:16,430
If things go well, it's thanks to them.
If not, it's our fault.

926
00:59:16,514 --> 00:59:18,224
Why is that your fault?

927
00:59:18,808 --> 00:59:20,852
All three of you are not at fault.

928
00:59:20,935 --> 00:59:22,353
The fault lies in the company

929
00:59:22,436 --> 00:59:24,105
and your superiors for tricking you.

930
00:59:24,814 --> 00:59:27,733
We cannot let this slide.

931
00:59:28,317 --> 00:59:33,114
I'll do whatever it takes
and take responsibility to amend this.

932
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,284
- Wait.
- Won't it be difficult for you

933
00:59:36,367 --> 00:59:37,493
to do much as a manager?

934
00:59:38,327 --> 00:59:39,412
I know, right?

935
00:59:39,495 --> 00:59:40,997
If he were a department manager…

936
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:42,331
That's hard too.

937
00:59:42,415 --> 00:59:43,916
He needs to be a head manager at least.

938
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,335
Hey, didn't you hear what Sa-rang said?

939
00:59:46,419 --> 00:59:49,589
She said her head manager
was a total jerk.

940
00:59:49,672 --> 00:59:51,215
He goes to work for fun.

941
00:59:51,299 --> 00:59:53,593
He wouldn't care about us lowlings.

942
00:59:54,343 --> 00:59:55,720
Right, Sa-rang?

943
01:00:02,143 --> 01:00:03,060
No.

944
01:00:04,395 --> 01:00:07,398
No. He's not a jerk anymore.

945
01:00:07,481 --> 01:00:08,983
He's a really nice person.

946
01:00:09,066 --> 01:00:11,027
Hey, get your head straight.

947
01:00:11,110 --> 01:00:12,778
As is the king, so are the subjects.

948
01:00:12,862 --> 01:00:15,406
If he were a good person,
we wouldn't be suffering like this.

949
01:00:15,489 --> 01:00:16,490
Right, Mr. No?

950
01:00:17,158 --> 01:00:18,451
I think he's all right.

951
01:00:18,534 --> 01:00:20,786
Someone like Mr. No
should be the head manager.

952
01:00:20,870 --> 01:00:21,913
You're right.

953
01:00:21,996 --> 01:00:25,499
Okay. May Mr. No become the head manager!

954
01:00:28,419 --> 01:00:30,838
It doesn't matter who does it.

955
01:00:30,922 --> 01:00:32,673
If you work this hard for the company,

956
01:00:32,757 --> 01:00:34,675
the company should also treat you well.

957
01:00:34,759 --> 01:00:36,802
I don't even expect that much.

958
01:00:36,886 --> 01:00:39,680
I just want to be appreciated
for the work that I do.

959
01:00:40,514 --> 01:00:43,601
Why do we have to wish for something
that should already be given?

960
01:00:44,185 --> 01:00:46,687
We deserve what we deserve.

961
01:00:53,069 --> 01:00:55,947
Anyway, it is an honor.

962
01:00:56,030 --> 01:00:58,699
The best employee at King Air,
King Distribution,

963
01:00:58,783 --> 01:01:00,409
and King Hotel.

964
01:01:00,493 --> 01:01:03,663
I'm with the best employees
of King Group right now.

965
01:01:04,622 --> 01:01:05,706
Like I said,

966
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:08,250
you should be the head manager, Mr. No.

967
01:01:08,334 --> 01:01:10,461
If you run for the position,
I'll vote for you.

968
01:01:10,544 --> 01:01:12,338
It's Mr. No.

969
01:01:12,421 --> 01:01:13,965
- It's Mr. No.
- It's Mr. No.

970
01:01:14,048 --> 01:01:15,508
- It's Mr. No.
- It's Mr. No.

971
01:01:15,591 --> 01:01:19,345
Since you guys are rooting for me,
I can't sit still.

972
01:01:19,929 --> 01:01:22,682
Order everything you want to eat tonight.

973
01:01:22,765 --> 01:01:24,976
On behalf of the company, I…

974
01:01:29,647 --> 01:01:30,773
As a manager,

975
01:01:31,607 --> 01:01:32,733
I'll pay for everything!

976
01:01:33,901 --> 01:01:35,903
Come on!

977
01:01:35,987 --> 01:01:37,238
Come on!

978
01:01:37,321 --> 01:01:38,864
Mr. No!

979
01:01:39,365 --> 01:01:41,325
"Gang Da-eul, Oh Pyeong-hwa,

980
01:01:41,409 --> 01:01:42,743
Cheon Sa-rang"?

981
01:01:43,327 --> 01:01:44,286
The kind Ms. Sa-rang?

982
01:01:44,370 --> 01:01:45,705
What is this?

983
01:01:45,788 --> 01:01:49,917
The number one employees
of King Distribution, Air, and Hotel.

984
01:01:50,001 --> 01:01:51,794
They are King Group's best employees.

985
01:01:51,877 --> 01:01:54,130
Prepare an overseas trip
as their incentive.

986
01:01:54,213 --> 01:01:56,215
The remaining employees
will be sent in turn.

987
01:01:56,298 --> 01:01:59,552
Why are you so concerned
about the employees' incentive trips?

988
01:02:00,469 --> 01:02:03,097
The company should reward them
for their performance.

989
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:04,515
Isn't that a given?

990
01:02:05,141 --> 01:02:07,101
I've never seen
such an openhanded company.

991
01:02:11,772 --> 01:02:12,857
There's one right here.

992
01:02:13,399 --> 01:02:15,359
- Ms. Gu's approval is needed, right?
- No.

993
01:02:15,943 --> 01:02:17,945
I'm making all the decisions
about the hotel.

994
01:02:18,029 --> 01:02:20,906
With employees from Distribution and Air,
it's the group's issue.

995
01:02:20,990 --> 01:02:23,034
- Will you be okay?
- You may proceed.

996
01:02:23,117 --> 01:02:24,994
I'll take responsibility.

997
01:02:25,077 --> 01:02:26,537
They are our group's best employees,

998
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:30,374
so it needs to be the finest
and most luxurious experience.

999
01:02:38,549 --> 01:02:39,508
Me?

1000
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:44,513
"A nice trip"?

1001
01:02:44,597 --> 01:02:46,515
WE'LL REWARD YOU WITH A NICE TRIP

1002
01:02:47,767 --> 01:02:48,934
What?

1003
01:02:49,018 --> 01:02:52,938
"Ms. Oh Pyeong-hwa, thank you
for your devotion and hard work."

1004
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:55,524
"We'll reward you with a nice trip."

1005
01:02:56,776 --> 01:02:57,735
Congratulations.

1006
01:02:57,818 --> 01:03:00,529
The best staff of the group
are being given incentive trips.

1007
01:03:01,197 --> 01:03:02,323
Congratulations.

1008
01:03:11,123 --> 01:03:12,166
Thank you.

1009
01:03:15,878 --> 01:03:18,506
They're leaving tomorrow.
Is everything ready?

1010
01:03:18,589 --> 01:03:19,632
Of course.

1011
01:03:19,715 --> 01:03:22,343
They will experience
the best trip of their lives.

1012
01:03:22,426 --> 01:03:23,761
You'll be shocked.

1013
01:03:27,765 --> 01:03:28,724
Get in, sir.

1014
01:03:28,808 --> 01:03:30,601
What? You've never done this before.

1015
01:03:30,684 --> 01:03:32,394
No, this is what I usually do

1016
01:03:32,478 --> 01:03:35,439
as King Group's best assistant.
You know that, right?

1017
01:03:44,490 --> 01:03:46,867
- Are you sick?
- No, I'm perfectly fine.

1018
01:03:52,665 --> 01:03:54,083
I'll drive you home safely.

1019
01:04:11,767 --> 01:04:12,601
I'm so excited.

1020
01:04:14,645 --> 01:04:15,980
- I'm so happy!
- Hey!

1021
01:04:17,898 --> 01:04:19,733
Oh my. Mr. No!

1022
01:04:19,817 --> 01:04:20,734
You're here.

1023
01:04:20,818 --> 01:04:22,695
This is all thanks to you.

1024
01:04:22,778 --> 01:04:23,863
I didn't do anything.

1025
01:04:23,946 --> 01:04:26,740
We're going on this trip
because you told the higher-ups.

1026
01:04:26,824 --> 01:04:28,409
You'll be blessed.

1027
01:04:28,492 --> 01:04:30,035
Thank you so much.

1028
01:04:31,245 --> 01:04:34,290
For this trip,
let's forget about everything

1029
01:04:34,373 --> 01:04:36,167
and make this a happy, exciting,

1030
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:37,668
and comfortable trip.

1031
01:04:37,751 --> 01:04:39,170
Let's go relax.

1032
01:04:39,253 --> 01:04:40,171
- Okay!
- Okay!

1033
01:04:40,754 --> 01:04:41,797
Let's go then.

1034
01:04:48,876 --> 01:04:50,295
Let's go relax.

1035
01:04:50,378 --> 01:04:51,296
- Okay!
- Okay!

1036
01:04:51,879 --> 01:04:52,922
Let's go then.

1037
01:05:01,743 --> 01:05:03,161
I'm so happy.

1038
01:05:03,745 --> 01:05:04,913
What should we eat first?

1039
01:05:04,996 --> 01:05:06,414
That's a good question.

1040
01:05:11,294 --> 01:05:12,462
Head…

1041
01:05:13,797 --> 01:05:16,925
Manager!

1042
01:05:21,304 --> 01:05:22,597
Be quiet.

1043
01:05:22,681 --> 01:05:23,807
- Who is he?
- Someone he knows?

1044
01:05:23,890 --> 01:05:24,724
Why are you here?

1045
01:05:24,808 --> 01:05:26,434
This is a trip
for King Group's best employees.

1046
01:05:26,518 --> 01:05:27,644
I'm the best assistant.

1047
01:05:27,727 --> 01:05:31,272
I get what you're saying.
I'll send you on a trip next time. So go--

1048
01:05:31,356 --> 01:05:33,525
That's ridiculous. I need to assist you.

1049
01:05:33,608 --> 01:05:35,151
Assist me with what?

1050
01:05:35,235 --> 01:05:36,945
- Just leave.
- Who are you?

1051
01:05:41,282 --> 01:05:43,576
- Hi, Sa-rang.
- Hello.

1052
01:05:44,619 --> 01:05:46,621
-It is an honor to finally meet
-He works at the hotel.

1053
01:05:46,705 --> 01:05:47,872
the people who were on the papers.

1054
01:05:47,956 --> 01:05:49,582
Let me introduce myself. I'm--

1055
01:05:49,666 --> 01:05:50,625
He is

1056
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:54,337
the man behind this incentive trip,

1057
01:05:54,421 --> 01:05:56,047
Department Manager Yoo Sang-sik.

1058
01:05:59,426 --> 01:06:01,010
What are you talking about?

1059
01:06:04,055 --> 01:06:06,057
Let's introduce ourselves again.

1060
01:06:06,141 --> 01:06:09,185
This is Mr. Yoo Sang-sik.
He's a department manager.

1061
01:06:10,854 --> 01:06:11,813
And I'm

1062
01:06:12,397 --> 01:06:13,398
Mr. No.

1063
01:06:13,481 --> 01:06:15,567
Thank you, Mr. Yoo.

1064
01:06:15,650 --> 01:06:17,444
Mr. Yoo, thank you.

1065
01:06:17,527 --> 01:06:18,987
Mr. Yoo Sang-sik,

1066
01:06:19,070 --> 01:06:20,363
thank you.

1067
01:06:21,489 --> 01:06:22,741
Mr. Yoo,

1068
01:06:23,491 --> 01:06:26,035
I will guide them from start to finish,

1069
01:06:26,953 --> 01:06:28,538
- so you may…
- Will you move, Mr. No?

1070
01:06:28,621 --> 01:06:29,497
- What?
- "What?"

1071
01:06:29,581 --> 01:06:30,707
- Pardon?
- Yes, "pardon."

1072
01:06:30,790 --> 01:06:32,083
I'm a department manager.
You're just a manager.

1073
01:06:32,167 --> 01:06:33,501
So can you go over there?

1074
01:06:34,502 --> 01:06:36,463
Let me introduce myself again properly.

1075
01:06:36,546 --> 01:06:39,132
I am the department manager
in charge of this trip,

1076
01:06:39,215 --> 01:06:40,967
No… I mean, Yoo Sang-sik.

1077
01:06:41,050 --> 01:06:42,177
It's nice to meet you.

1078
01:06:46,097 --> 01:06:48,516
The concept of this trip is "We go hard."

1079
01:06:49,184 --> 01:06:50,727
When we eat, go hard.

1080
01:06:50,810 --> 01:06:52,437
When we have fun, go hard.

1081
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:54,314
- All together…
- We go hard!

1082
01:06:54,397 --> 01:06:55,273
You're so energetic.

1083
01:06:56,858 --> 01:06:59,819
But Mr. No,
why do you have your mouth shut?

1084
01:07:05,492 --> 01:07:07,494
Just act like I'm not here, please.

1085
01:07:07,577 --> 01:07:09,287
Unity is key for this trip.

1086
01:07:09,370 --> 01:07:11,080
Individual activities are not allowed.

1087
01:07:11,164 --> 01:07:13,583
We'll set off after shouting our chant.

1088
01:07:14,209 --> 01:07:16,002
- When we eat…
- Go hard!

1089
01:07:16,085 --> 01:07:17,837
- When we have fun…
- Go hard!

1090
01:07:17,921 --> 01:07:19,714
- All together, we go hard!
- We go hard!

1091
01:07:19,798 --> 01:07:21,758
Okay. Let's go!

1092
01:07:32,477 --> 01:07:33,728
Why aren't you coming?

1093
01:07:33,812 --> 01:07:37,023
I'm not letting Mr. No get away with this.

1094
01:07:37,106 --> 01:07:38,441
I thought he was Mr. Yoo.

1095
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:41,069
His enthusiasm is nice. Let's go.

1096
01:07:44,239 --> 01:07:45,281
Mr. No!

1097
01:07:45,824 --> 01:07:48,076
- Hurry up!
- Hurry up!

1098
01:07:48,159 --> 01:07:49,786
Okay. Coming.

1099
01:07:50,453 --> 01:07:51,371
I'm coming.

1100
01:07:51,454 --> 01:07:53,540
Mr. No, let's go!

1101
01:07:54,541 --> 01:07:57,669
Mr. No, let's go!

1102
01:08:08,972 --> 01:08:11,975
KING THE LAND

1103
01:08:44,090 --> 01:08:44,924
<i>Go hard!</i>

1104
01:08:45,008 --> 01:08:46,009
- Go hard!
- Go hard!

1105
01:08:47,343 --> 01:08:49,137
<i>Let me announce today's schedule.</i>

1106
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:50,179
<i>What about free time?</i>

1107
01:08:50,263 --> 01:08:51,848
<i>There's no free time on a group tour.</i>

1108
01:08:51,931 --> 01:08:53,683
<i>- Let's get out of here.
- Now?</i>

1109
01:08:53,766 --> 01:08:54,767
Now.

1110
01:08:56,728 --> 01:08:57,645
<i>A trip?</i>

1111
01:08:57,729 --> 01:09:00,648
<i>How could something in King Group
be carried out without my knowledge?</i>

1112
01:09:00,732 --> 01:09:03,401
<i>But I keep wanting more.</i>

1113
01:09:03,484 --> 01:09:07,071
<i>I feel so happy that I begin to wonder
if I'm allowed this much happiness.</i>

1114
01:09:07,155 --> 01:09:11,367
<i>I keep hoping that
I'll continue to be this happy.</i>

1115
01:09:11,451 --> 01:09:14,245
<i>I'll make every day of yours
filled with happiness.</i>
