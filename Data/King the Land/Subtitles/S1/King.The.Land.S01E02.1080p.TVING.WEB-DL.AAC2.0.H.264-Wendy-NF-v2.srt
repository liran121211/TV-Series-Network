1
00:00:48,589 --> 00:00:52,968
KING THE LAND

2
00:00:53,049 --> 00:00:57,055
KING THE LAND

3
00:00:57,469 --> 00:00:59,082
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

4
00:00:59,163 --> 00:01:00,902
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

5
00:01:05,516 --> 00:01:07,226
The bathroom is bigger than my house.

6
00:01:09,061 --> 00:01:09,895
This is cool.

7
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:10,938
What?

8
00:01:28,914 --> 00:01:30,874
- Don't look.
- I won't.

9
00:01:33,836 --> 00:01:34,753
You really can't.

10
00:01:34,837 --> 00:01:36,755
I won't, even if you beg me.

11
00:01:37,256 --> 00:01:38,173
What do you take me for?

12
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:59,820
EPISODE 2

13
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,286
You need to come out.

14
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,458
I'm sorry but can you please just go?

15
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:15,044
I need my phone.

16
00:02:15,753 --> 00:02:17,463
I'll bring it to you.

17
00:02:17,546 --> 00:02:19,214
Open up. I'm busy.

18
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,718
I'm coming in.

19
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,404
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:48,077 --> 00:02:49,495
I'm so sorry.

21
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:58,796
You know me, right?

22
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:01,590
We've met before, haven't we?

23
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:05,386
No, I've never seen you.

24
00:03:06,345 --> 00:03:07,262
I'm so sorry.

25
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:08,847
I'm sorry.

26
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:10,349
This is my room…

27
00:03:14,478 --> 00:03:15,646
Let's speak for a moment.

28
00:03:16,438 --> 00:03:18,315
What's with him? Why is he following me?

29
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:19,650
Stop right there.

30
00:03:24,113 --> 00:03:25,239
Can't you hear me?

31
00:03:29,785 --> 00:03:31,120
May I help you, sir?

32
00:03:32,121 --> 00:03:33,038
It's you, right?

33
00:03:33,872 --> 00:03:34,748
The treadmill.

34
00:03:34,832 --> 00:03:36,333
Sorry? The treadmill?

35
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,876
You suddenly called me a pervert.

36
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,795
Don't you remember?

37
00:03:39,878 --> 00:03:40,921
A pervert?

38
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,052
What a pervert.

39
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:48,887
Hey--

40
00:03:49,471 --> 00:03:50,722
If you ever do this again,

41
00:03:50,806 --> 00:03:52,391
I'm going to kill you.

42
00:03:52,474 --> 00:03:54,518
Please keep that in mind, Mr. Pervert.

43
00:03:56,812 --> 00:03:58,397
That tiger T-shirt?

44
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,481
Yes.

45
00:03:59,565 --> 00:04:01,483
- Do you finally remember?
- Yes.

46
00:04:02,151 --> 00:04:03,068
I knew it.

47
00:04:03,152 --> 00:04:05,529
You were staring like a pervert
without turning away.

48
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:07,698
Aren't you the pervert

49
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,950
for turning the window transparent
while on the toilet?

50
00:04:11,368 --> 00:04:13,203
Nothing I do can top you.

51
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:16,457
Apologize.

52
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,001
For both today and that day.

53
00:04:23,213 --> 00:04:24,965
I'm truly sorry for today.

54
00:04:25,048 --> 00:04:27,718
However, you were the one at fault
back on that day.

55
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:30,304
I believe you're the one
who owes me an apology.

56
00:04:30,387 --> 00:04:31,388
Why me?

57
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:34,892
If you don't know
why you should apologize,

58
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:36,226
there's no need to go on.

59
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:38,437
Please excuse me.

60
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,189
Enjoy your stay, sir.

61
00:04:49,364 --> 00:04:50,449
Excuse me.

62
00:04:51,492 --> 00:04:52,326
Hey!

63
00:04:56,121 --> 00:04:57,539
I wasn't done talking.

64
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,626
I'm sorry, but I have nothing more to say.

65
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,544
And both back then and now,

66
00:05:02,628 --> 00:05:04,713
I don't even have
the fanciest interest in you,

67
00:05:04,796 --> 00:05:05,923
so stop following me.

68
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:07,758
There's no talking to you.

69
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:09,593
Nothing you can do will get to me.

70
00:05:10,385 --> 00:05:11,345
Okay.

71
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:14,681
I don't need to show courtesy
to someone who behaves like this.

72
00:05:15,641 --> 00:05:16,558
This is a warning.

73
00:05:16,642 --> 00:05:19,394
Don't ever let me see you again.

74
00:05:22,147 --> 00:05:25,025
Yes, sir.
That is also precisely what I want.

75
00:05:25,984 --> 00:05:26,902
And stop smiling.

76
00:05:26,985 --> 00:05:31,406
All staff of King Hotel serve our guests
with sincere, bright smiles.

77
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,033
If my smile is displeasing to you,

78
00:05:33,116 --> 00:05:35,202
please consider staying at another hotel.

79
00:05:35,285 --> 00:05:36,286
Excuse me.

80
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,250
Guest first.

81
00:05:49,967 --> 00:05:51,510
That perverted jerk.

82
00:05:57,099 --> 00:05:59,559
And it's not "fanciest," but "faintest."

83
00:06:00,435 --> 00:06:01,270
Sorry?

84
00:06:01,353 --> 00:06:04,356
It's not "I don't have
the fanciest interest in you."

85
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:06,775
It's "I don't have
the faintest interest in you."

86
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,777
That's the correct expression.

87
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,320
In case people make fun of you.

88
00:06:14,825 --> 00:06:17,119
That's one condescending jerk.

89
00:06:17,828 --> 00:06:18,954
RESUME
NAME: GU WON

90
00:06:19,037 --> 00:06:21,373
I asked for a resume
and you really brought one.

91
00:06:22,124 --> 00:06:23,667
You must really want to work here.

92
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,002
Rules are rules.

93
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:26,128
And your family register?

94
00:06:27,212 --> 00:06:28,422
Come on, we're family.

95
00:06:28,505 --> 00:06:29,881
Rules are rules.

96
00:06:31,174 --> 00:06:33,135
If that's too troublesome,
don't work here.

97
00:06:33,218 --> 00:06:36,221
Why go through all this when
you don't even care about the business?

98
00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:39,850
I'll submit it.

99
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:41,643
This is fun.

100
00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:46,064
I'll need two copies
of the family register.

101
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:51,153
MANAGING DIRECTOR GU HWA-RAN

102
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,447
Thirty minutes.

103
00:06:57,993 --> 00:06:59,077
Hello.

104
00:06:59,995 --> 00:07:01,079
We meet again.

105
00:07:01,163 --> 00:07:04,583
I'm hosting the inaugural ceremony today.

106
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:05,709
Really?

107
00:07:06,335 --> 00:07:08,462
I dread standing before a crowd,

108
00:07:09,338 --> 00:07:11,715
but my higher-ups say it has to be me.

109
00:07:12,424 --> 00:07:13,467
I understand.

110
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,303
Life can be tiring when you're in demand.

111
00:07:17,554 --> 00:07:19,931
- Do you want to have dinner after?
- I'd love to!

112
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:23,101
- Is that all right?
- Absolutely. I'd love to.

113
00:07:23,602 --> 00:07:26,021
Then I'll meet you tonight for dinner.

114
00:07:26,897 --> 00:07:28,231
Okay, sure.

115
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:30,734
Good luck at the ceremony.

116
00:07:31,443 --> 00:07:32,277
Thank you.

117
00:07:36,031 --> 00:07:37,616
See? It worked.

118
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:39,743
Great job, Sang-sik. Good one.

119
00:07:42,954 --> 00:07:44,831
- Where are you going?
- To get my family register.

120
00:07:44,915 --> 00:07:47,834
Ask the staff to run your errands.
Let's go. Everyone is waiting.

121
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:49,419
For who? Me?

122
00:07:50,462 --> 00:07:52,005
- Why?
- The inaugural ceremony.

123
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:54,758
After the ceremony,
you have a celebratory dinner

124
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,343
with the board and the VIPs.

125
00:07:56,426 --> 00:07:57,761
No, I'm not going.

126
00:07:58,387 --> 00:08:00,639
The chairman gave
a direct order to the PR team.

127
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:06,812
Why are you so nervous?

128
00:08:06,895 --> 00:08:09,064
The rest of your life
will be like a party.

129
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:10,857
Let's go.

130
00:08:19,491 --> 00:08:20,867
Hello.

131
00:08:20,951 --> 00:08:24,204
I'm Manager Kim Su-mi,
here to host today's ceremony.

132
00:08:24,746 --> 00:08:26,707
Let us begin the inaugural ceremony

133
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:29,334
to welcome the new head manager
of King Hotel.

134
00:08:29,418 --> 00:08:32,045
Please welcome Head Manager Gu Won
with a big round of applause.

135
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:45,475
What's that pervert doing here?

136
00:08:51,982 --> 00:08:55,068
INAUGURAL CEREMONY FOR HEAD MANAGER GU WON

137
00:08:58,363 --> 00:08:59,448
Continue.

138
00:08:59,531 --> 00:09:00,949
I've never seen…

139
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,160
I mean,

140
00:09:03,702 --> 00:09:06,288
Head Manager Gu will share
an inaugural speech.

141
00:09:07,456 --> 00:09:08,749
Oh, no.

142
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:36,109
<i>Don't smile.</i>

143
00:09:38,069 --> 00:09:39,571
<i>Stop smiling.</i>

144
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:43,325
<i>Don't smile.</i>

145
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,621
<i>Stop smiling.</i>

146
00:10:21,112 --> 00:10:23,448
Hello. My name is Gu Won.

147
00:10:24,032 --> 00:10:25,826
I hope to make the best of our time.

148
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:28,119
- Let's end this.
- Sorry?

149
00:10:28,745 --> 00:10:29,704
Yes.

150
00:10:30,622 --> 00:10:33,458
Then let us end the inaugural ceremony.

151
00:10:34,042 --> 00:10:36,169
King Hotel's best talent,
Ms. Cheon Sa-rang,

152
00:10:36,253 --> 00:10:38,296
- will welcome the head manager.
- I'm done for.

153
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,631
Bring out the bouquet.

154
00:10:40,257 --> 00:10:41,132
Darn it.

155
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:11,997
We…

156
00:11:12,956 --> 00:11:14,082
meet again.

157
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,839
Welcome, Head Manager Gu!

158
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:23,842
Really?

159
00:11:23,925 --> 00:11:26,136
Yes, we truly welcome you.

160
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:28,930
- Do you mean it?
- Yes, sir.

161
00:11:30,932 --> 00:11:32,559
This is from all of us.

162
00:11:54,925 --> 00:11:56,719
Next week, you'll film a promo video

163
00:11:56,802 --> 00:12:00,180
with the best talent of the year,
our kind Ms. Sa-rang.

164
00:12:00,264 --> 00:12:02,808
The PR team
will send you the script directly.

165
00:12:03,434 --> 00:12:04,560
- That's all?
- That's all.

166
00:12:04,643 --> 00:12:05,978
- You may leave.
- Okay.

167
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,272
I'll excuse myself as well.

168
00:12:10,691 --> 00:12:12,651
Ms. Best Talent, come here.

169
00:12:29,293 --> 00:12:32,171
I warned you
to never let me see you again.

170
00:12:32,254 --> 00:12:34,673
I'll do my best to avoid you from now on.

171
00:12:38,302 --> 00:12:41,054
- Do you know what hospitality is?
- Yes, I know it very well.

172
00:12:41,138 --> 00:12:42,639
Is avoiding discomfort hospitable?

173
00:12:42,723 --> 00:12:45,350
I'm only meeting your request
to avoid running into you.

174
00:12:48,854 --> 00:12:50,105
Anyway,

175
00:12:50,189 --> 00:12:51,523
why am I a pervert?

176
00:12:52,775 --> 00:12:55,027
Not only did you make
awkward moaning sounds

177
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,987
in the gym, which is a public space,

178
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,573
but you also gave me
your room key as a tip

179
00:13:00,157 --> 00:13:01,450
along with a creepy note

180
00:13:01,533 --> 00:13:04,453
talking about "my cunning advances"
and "a steamy night together."

181
00:13:05,412 --> 00:13:07,164
- Me?
- Back then, I was new.

182
00:13:07,247 --> 00:13:08,916
I admit I didn't follow the manual.

183
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:09,833
However,

184
00:13:09,917 --> 00:13:12,169
I do not have a reason
to condone such disrespect

185
00:13:12,252 --> 00:13:14,421
just because I work in hospitality.

186
00:13:15,047 --> 00:13:17,257
What are you talking about?
When did I do that?

187
00:13:17,341 --> 00:13:19,927
I've never done anything like that,

188
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:24,014
and you're nowhere near my type,
not even over my dead body.

189
00:13:26,099 --> 00:13:28,060
Are you sure I'm him? Are you positive?

190
00:13:28,143 --> 00:13:30,145
You were wearing
a T-shirt with a tiger print.

191
00:13:30,229 --> 00:13:31,104
Are you kidding me?

192
00:13:31,855 --> 00:13:33,148
Is everyone who wears that a pervert?

193
00:13:34,233 --> 00:13:38,028
I clearly heard that a man
in a tiger print T-shirt gave it to me.

194
00:13:42,741 --> 00:13:43,826
So you're saying

195
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,203
you made an assumption about me

196
00:13:47,454 --> 00:13:48,956
just by looking at my T-shirt?

197
00:13:50,082 --> 00:13:52,626
So that wasn't you who did that?

198
00:13:53,502 --> 00:13:55,170
What do you take me for?

199
00:13:55,754 --> 00:13:56,672
Why would I?

200
00:13:56,755 --> 00:13:57,673
To you, no less?

201
00:13:58,924 --> 00:13:59,925
I told you, didn't I?

202
00:14:00,008 --> 00:14:02,261
Even over my dead body,

203
00:14:02,344 --> 00:14:05,180
you are without a doubt,
absolutely, most definitely

204
00:14:06,223 --> 00:14:07,307
not my type.

205
00:14:10,644 --> 00:14:11,687
I'm sorry.

206
00:14:12,312 --> 00:14:13,730
You should've told me so.

207
00:14:13,814 --> 00:14:15,107
You never gave me a chance.

208
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:20,529
I'm sorry.

209
00:14:21,864 --> 00:14:22,906
I'm sorry.

210
00:14:26,869 --> 00:14:27,911
Don't smile.

211
00:14:28,495 --> 00:14:30,539
I loathe that fake smile.

212
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:34,042
I must smile on duty.
Just think of it as part of my uniform.

213
00:14:34,126 --> 00:14:35,002
Even so, don't.

214
00:14:39,173 --> 00:14:40,924
- Really?
- If you smile, you're fired.

215
00:14:46,597 --> 00:14:47,639
Thank you.

216
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:51,185
I wasn't ready to show you
a heartfelt smile.

217
00:14:51,768 --> 00:14:53,687
Thank you for not letting me fake a smile.

218
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:54,730
Also,

219
00:14:56,148 --> 00:14:58,817
I truly apologize
for what I did on that day.

220
00:14:59,568 --> 00:15:01,403
I apologize from the bottom of my heart.

221
00:15:05,032 --> 00:15:06,033
Take the flowers and leave.

222
00:15:06,867 --> 00:15:07,743
Yes, sir.

223
00:15:21,006 --> 00:15:22,007
A pervert?

224
00:15:28,263 --> 00:15:29,932
There's no pervert like me.

225
00:15:31,725 --> 00:15:32,768
Jeez.

226
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:40,442
This way, sir.

227
00:15:40,984 --> 00:15:43,320
- Please hang up my coat.
- Of course.

228
00:15:48,242 --> 00:15:49,826
Let me escort you to your seat.

229
00:15:52,412 --> 00:15:53,830
Right over here, sir.

230
00:15:54,331 --> 00:15:55,415
Put my suitcase up.

231
00:15:58,126 --> 00:15:59,962
Yes, I'll put it in the overhead bin.

232
00:16:00,045 --> 00:16:01,672
Please enjoy your flight.

233
00:16:23,944 --> 00:16:25,070
You might get hurt.

234
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:28,407
Let me handle it.

235
00:16:31,285 --> 00:16:32,411
Hello.

236
00:16:49,761 --> 00:16:52,014
They can just leave the tray as is.

237
00:16:52,097 --> 00:16:53,223
Why do people do this?

238
00:16:53,849 --> 00:16:55,017
Because they're kind.

239
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,644
They think stacking these
will make our lives easier.

240
00:16:57,728 --> 00:16:59,354
That's not kindness. It's excessive.

241
00:16:59,438 --> 00:17:01,273
This is a useless courtesy.

242
00:17:01,356 --> 00:17:03,066
Just accept the gesture.

243
00:17:03,817 --> 00:17:06,028
Let's clean up
and get ready for duty-free sales.

244
00:17:06,111 --> 00:17:08,947
Ro-un and Eun-ji, clean the restrooms
when the seatbelt sign turns on.

245
00:17:09,031 --> 00:17:10,115
- Yes.
- Yes.

246
00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:14,745
Who took the coat
from the passenger in 3H?

247
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,663
I did.

248
00:17:16,747 --> 00:17:18,498
It's not in the closet.

249
00:17:18,582 --> 00:17:19,666
Where did you leave it?

250
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,376
I threw it out.

251
00:17:22,002 --> 00:17:22,919
What?

252
00:17:23,003 --> 00:17:24,629
What are you talking about?

253
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,799
He asked me to.

254
00:17:28,425 --> 00:17:29,634
This way, sir.

255
00:17:30,844 --> 00:17:31,928
Please hang up my coat.

256
00:17:32,012 --> 00:17:33,847
<i>"Please dump my coat."</i>

257
00:17:34,389 --> 00:17:35,849
That's what he said.

258
00:17:37,309 --> 00:17:38,393
Hey!

259
00:17:48,987 --> 00:17:51,865
Are you all trying to get me fired?

260
00:17:51,948 --> 00:17:53,700
I told you not to cause trouble!

261
00:17:53,784 --> 00:17:54,993
I'm sorry.

262
00:17:55,077 --> 00:17:56,745
An apology isn't going to fix this.

263
00:17:57,454 --> 00:17:59,247
He told me to bring it right away!

264
00:17:59,331 --> 00:18:01,083
I'll take responsibility.

265
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,335
How dare you say that
when you're a mere rookie?

266
00:18:04,211 --> 00:18:06,004
You aren't in a position to do that.

267
00:18:08,256 --> 00:18:09,633
What will you do now?

268
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:13,220
What are you all going to do about this?

269
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:17,641
I'll take responsibility and handle this.

270
00:18:21,561 --> 00:18:22,604
Will you?

271
00:18:23,772 --> 00:18:25,190
Pyeong-hwa,

272
00:18:25,273 --> 00:18:28,026
then make sure it doesn't affect me.

273
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,946
Handle it quietly and efficiently. Okay?

274
00:18:34,074 --> 00:18:37,327
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

275
00:18:37,411 --> 00:18:39,579
Forget it. I'll be in the transit lounge,

276
00:18:39,663 --> 00:18:41,581
so bring it before my next flight.

277
00:18:41,665 --> 00:18:44,084
If you don't,
I won't let you off for this.

278
00:18:45,168 --> 00:18:47,712
Yes, sir. I'll bring it to you
as soon as possible.

279
00:18:49,047 --> 00:18:50,382
I'm very sorry.

280
00:18:51,883 --> 00:18:54,136
I'm sorry. Please help me.

281
00:18:54,219 --> 00:18:55,679
Please help me just this once.

282
00:18:55,762 --> 00:18:56,721
I can't.

283
00:18:57,514 --> 00:18:58,890
I'm very behind right now.

284
00:18:58,974 --> 00:19:00,434
I'll pay you twice as much.

285
00:19:00,517 --> 00:19:01,560
It's fine.

286
00:19:01,643 --> 00:19:04,354
Three times, four times,
or however much you want.

287
00:19:04,438 --> 00:19:06,398
Please help me.

288
00:19:06,898 --> 00:19:10,193
Sir, please. I'm begging you.

289
00:20:01,328 --> 00:20:02,913
You'll get hurt if you run like that.

290
00:20:03,413 --> 00:20:04,289
Get some rest.

291
00:20:26,102 --> 00:20:28,897
You were a great host
at the ceremony today.

292
00:20:29,856 --> 00:20:30,857
How may I help you?

293
00:20:31,566 --> 00:20:32,943
Do you like snow crab?

294
00:20:33,026 --> 00:20:35,487
How about it for dinner?
I'll be crabby if not.

295
00:20:36,154 --> 00:20:37,197
Hey.

296
00:20:37,697 --> 00:20:40,116
Is it fun going around
pretending to be Mr. Gu?

297
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,618
Mr. Gu?

298
00:20:42,202 --> 00:20:43,286
I never said I was him.

299
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:45,830
I was supposed to eat dinner
with the head manager,

300
00:20:46,414 --> 00:20:48,375
but you're not the head manager.

301
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:50,710
Why should I eat dinner with you?

302
00:20:50,794 --> 00:20:53,296
So you have no business
with the secretary.

303
00:20:54,506 --> 00:20:55,882
Is that what you're saying?

304
00:20:55,966 --> 00:20:56,967
Exactly.

305
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:57,968
I totally don't.

306
00:20:58,051 --> 00:20:59,511
You're a total, absolute snob.

307
00:20:59,594 --> 00:21:00,845
I'm like that.

308
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:04,099
So let's not exchange greetings
ever again.

309
00:21:06,017 --> 00:21:07,394
Don't worry.

310
00:21:07,477 --> 00:21:09,437
I don't go anywhere near snobs.

311
00:21:10,355 --> 00:21:11,231
It'll rub off on me.

312
00:21:11,314 --> 00:21:12,315
Oh, my! It's rubbing off.

313
00:21:12,399 --> 00:21:14,025
What? Rub off on you?

314
00:21:14,109 --> 00:21:16,027
Ms. Sa-rang, you're here. Let's go.

315
00:21:16,111 --> 00:21:18,905
You are to attend
Mr. Gu's welcome dinner as the staff rep.

316
00:21:18,989 --> 00:21:20,073
What? Me?

317
00:21:20,156 --> 00:21:21,700
Wait, why should she go?

318
00:21:21,783 --> 00:21:23,660
I should be the staff representative.

319
00:21:23,743 --> 00:21:24,661
No.

320
00:21:24,744 --> 00:21:27,497
A snobby manager
couldn't possibly represent the staff.

321
00:21:27,581 --> 00:21:28,707
That's nonsense.

322
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:31,918
The higher-ups do have a discerning eye
when it comes to people.

323
00:21:32,002 --> 00:21:33,420
- What?
- Let's go. We're late.

324
00:21:34,087 --> 00:21:35,130
I'll be back.

325
00:21:35,213 --> 00:21:36,965
Careful, there's some snobbiness here.

326
00:21:37,048 --> 00:21:38,758
- This way, please.
- Darn it.

327
00:21:41,261 --> 00:21:44,139
That crabby-looking man.
Snow crab, my foot.

328
00:21:49,436 --> 00:21:50,645
It's so nice.

329
00:21:50,729 --> 00:21:52,272
Is this your first time here?

330
00:21:52,355 --> 00:21:54,274
But you've worked here for so long.

331
00:21:54,357 --> 00:21:55,650
This is King the Land.

332
00:21:55,734 --> 00:21:57,777
Since it's a lounge on the VIP floor,

333
00:21:57,861 --> 00:22:00,030
regular staff can't come here
even after 100 years.

334
00:22:00,113 --> 00:22:01,865
And you're finally here.

335
00:22:01,948 --> 00:22:03,241
Enjoy the day.

336
00:22:03,325 --> 00:22:05,035
Today, you're a VIP too.

337
00:22:05,118 --> 00:22:06,077
Okay.

338
00:22:57,712 --> 00:22:58,838
This is fabulous.

339
00:23:08,681 --> 00:23:10,517
You said you'd do your best to avoid me.

340
00:23:29,244 --> 00:23:30,829
Tuna cheek, sir.

341
00:23:30,912 --> 00:23:31,830
- Thank you.
- Yes.

342
00:23:31,913 --> 00:23:33,331
- Please enjoy.
- Yes.

343
00:23:38,169 --> 00:23:40,964
Was the tuna you caught
500 million won, Chairman Han?

344
00:23:42,132 --> 00:23:43,091
500 million?

345
00:23:43,174 --> 00:23:44,717
It was 590 million won.

346
00:23:45,301 --> 00:23:46,719
- Goodness.
- How much was this one?

347
00:23:46,803 --> 00:23:47,846
We paid 700 million.

348
00:23:50,432 --> 00:23:53,726
Hwa-ran has such excellent discernment.

349
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:56,855
You'll never see another tuna
as nice as this one.

350
00:23:56,938 --> 00:23:58,898
Do you want to make a bet?

351
00:23:58,982 --> 00:24:01,526
What if I find a better tuna than that?

352
00:24:01,609 --> 00:24:02,652
Good grief.

353
00:24:02,735 --> 00:24:04,946
What counts is the heart,
not the price tag.

354
00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:08,825
Hwa-ran prepared this to celebrate
her brother's appointment.

355
00:24:09,492 --> 00:24:12,996
I always knew you were generous.
Turns out you're kind as well.

356
00:24:13,997 --> 00:24:15,457
Now that he's joined the hotel,

357
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,792
he might steal it from you.

358
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,547
Will you take charge of King the Land?

359
00:24:23,131 --> 00:24:24,966
It's basically a mandatory course

360
00:24:25,049 --> 00:24:27,343
for your business management training.

361
00:24:27,427 --> 00:24:29,929
- Stop saying such nonsense.
- What?

362
00:24:30,013 --> 00:24:32,891
In a competition,
whoever is better wins it all.

363
00:24:33,391 --> 00:24:35,310
Why would I compete with Won?

364
00:24:35,393 --> 00:24:36,936
I should help him.

365
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,605
Father, please make a toast.

366
00:24:38,688 --> 00:24:39,689
Yes, I will.

367
00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:42,150
All right, everyone.

368
00:24:43,318 --> 00:24:44,569
I'd like to thank

369
00:24:44,652 --> 00:24:48,823
the chairpersons, executives, and staff
who came here to celebrate

370
00:24:48,907 --> 00:24:50,617
despite your busy schedules.

371
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,828
Please show your support
for Head Manager Gu Won

372
00:24:53,912 --> 00:24:56,331
in his future endeavors.

373
00:24:57,332 --> 00:24:59,125
Now, let us enjoy.

374
00:25:00,001 --> 00:25:00,919
Cheers!

375
00:25:09,969 --> 00:25:11,679
Who are you?

376
00:25:12,764 --> 00:25:13,723
Well…

377
00:25:14,307 --> 00:25:17,018
I'm Cheon Sa-rang, stationed in the lobby.

378
00:25:17,101 --> 00:25:18,978
She's our best talent,

379
00:25:19,062 --> 00:25:20,563
here to represent our staff.

380
00:25:20,647 --> 00:25:21,773
Really?

381
00:25:21,856 --> 00:25:25,568
That must mean you're
the most hospitable staff in our hotel.

382
00:25:25,652 --> 00:25:27,820
Why don't you come out

383
00:25:27,904 --> 00:25:29,113
and make a speech for us?

384
00:25:30,281 --> 00:25:31,866
- Me?
- Do you feel uncomfortable?

385
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:34,827
No, sir.

386
00:25:53,555 --> 00:25:55,932
It's a great honor to serve a head manager

387
00:25:56,015 --> 00:25:58,142
of such great character and intellect.

388
00:25:58,226 --> 00:25:59,602
So fake.

389
00:25:59,686 --> 00:26:01,312
We truly welcome you.

390
00:26:03,815 --> 00:26:04,816
Enjoy.

391
00:26:08,653 --> 00:26:11,281
I like your outspoken personality.

392
00:26:11,364 --> 00:26:12,240
Thank you.

393
00:26:12,323 --> 00:26:13,825
Mr. Kim, can you find

394
00:26:13,908 --> 00:26:15,827
the most precious part of the tuna

395
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,829
and give it to our best talent?

396
00:26:17,912 --> 00:26:19,372
Yes, sir.

397
00:26:19,998 --> 00:26:21,958
Thank you. I'll enjoy it.

398
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:24,419
That fake work smile.

399
00:26:24,502 --> 00:26:26,629
Won, you should share a word too.

400
00:26:28,339 --> 00:26:29,215
I'm fine.

401
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:32,176
Get up. You're the man of the hour.

402
00:26:45,273 --> 00:26:48,526
Thank you for sparing your precious time.

403
00:27:03,499 --> 00:27:04,500
Also,

404
00:27:05,585 --> 00:27:06,961
I'll make King Hotel

405
00:27:07,712 --> 00:27:10,798
a place without fake smiles.

406
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,106
How about, "We are the world"?

407
00:27:28,274 --> 00:27:29,359
Cheers.

408
00:27:31,653 --> 00:27:32,737
How amazing.

409
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:35,657
He holds an inaugural ceremony
and a party for his son,

410
00:27:36,407 --> 00:27:38,076
even getting the PR team involved.

411
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:40,411
What's the matter?

412
00:27:40,912 --> 00:27:41,746
Are you scared?

413
00:27:42,955 --> 00:27:44,082
Of a boy like you?

414
00:27:44,832 --> 00:27:46,167
Let me make this clear.

415
00:27:46,876 --> 00:27:49,087
I don't care about management
or taking over the company.

416
00:27:49,962 --> 00:27:51,089
So no need to be scared.

417
00:27:51,172 --> 00:27:52,632
If you really don't care,

418
00:27:53,466 --> 00:27:55,343
why did you bother to finish your MBA?

419
00:27:55,426 --> 00:27:57,470
Well, I was good enough to get one.

420
00:27:58,179 --> 00:28:00,807
There's no need to hide my competence.

421
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:03,976
Putting it like that
doesn't make you sound cool.

422
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,104
I don't care what others think.

423
00:28:07,188 --> 00:28:08,731
And I won't work here for long.

424
00:28:09,357 --> 00:28:10,274
So…

425
00:28:11,818 --> 00:28:12,777
don't mess with me.

426
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,529
So don't be so cheeky

427
00:28:15,363 --> 00:28:17,031
if you want to enjoy this luxury.

428
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:26,791
Here, come meet my children.

429
00:28:35,967 --> 00:28:37,093
What's this?

430
00:28:37,176 --> 00:28:38,803
Tuna. A present from the chairman.

431
00:28:39,971 --> 00:28:40,972
Thank you.

432
00:28:42,181 --> 00:28:43,266
Excuse me.

433
00:28:44,809 --> 00:28:47,437
May I be excused?

434
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,354
Sure.

435
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,565
Should I let the chairman know?

436
00:28:51,315 --> 00:28:54,110
Just go. Nobody cares about you.

437
00:29:43,826 --> 00:29:46,204
KETTLE-COOKED COW'S HEAD GUKBAP

438
00:29:53,711 --> 00:29:56,631
Yes, my dear. Are you coming home?

439
00:29:57,548 --> 00:29:58,674
I'm not.

440
00:29:59,258 --> 00:30:01,135
Grandma, do you want some tuna?

441
00:30:01,219 --> 00:30:02,762
What? Some pumas?

442
00:30:03,513 --> 00:30:05,723
No, not pumas. Tuna.

443
00:30:05,807 --> 00:30:07,767
I'm busy right now.

444
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:09,477
Call me when you come.

445
00:30:13,356 --> 00:30:15,483
Gosh, she's always like this.

446
00:30:16,067 --> 00:30:18,027
CONTACTS

447
00:30:20,655 --> 00:30:22,782
Let's have a drink!

448
00:30:31,874 --> 00:30:32,708
Hello?

449
00:30:32,792 --> 00:30:35,253
The chairman gave me tuna today.
Do you want some?

450
00:30:35,336 --> 00:30:36,462
I'm fine. You have it.

451
00:30:37,255 --> 00:30:40,591
It's worth 700 million won,
and he gave me the most expensive part.

452
00:30:40,675 --> 00:30:43,052
I'm in Busan eating tuna right now.

453
00:30:43,636 --> 00:30:45,221
Busan? Why?

454
00:30:45,304 --> 00:30:46,472
<i>Didn't I tell you?</i>

455
00:30:46,556 --> 00:30:48,224
I came to see a game with the club.

456
00:30:48,307 --> 00:30:51,018
I'm going to hang out here for a bit,
then be back by the weekend.

457
00:30:51,102 --> 00:30:53,271
But we were going to Namsan tomorrow.

458
00:30:53,354 --> 00:30:54,689
<i>That was tomorrow?</i>

459
00:30:57,233 --> 00:30:58,484
Did I make this plan alone?

460
00:30:58,568 --> 00:30:59,819
<i>This game is important,</i>

461
00:30:59,902 --> 00:31:01,445
so let me off just this once.

462
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:04,282
But let's go next week
to do that lock thing

463
00:31:04,365 --> 00:31:05,616
<i>and whatever else you want.</i>

464
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,285
Yu-nam, come here!

465
00:31:07,368 --> 00:31:08,744
I have to go. I'll call you!

466
00:31:10,163 --> 00:31:10,997
All right.

467
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,039
Hello?

468
00:31:39,358 --> 00:31:40,359
I'm sorry.

469
00:31:45,031 --> 00:31:46,115
It's the head!

470
00:31:46,199 --> 00:31:48,784
It's tuna.

471
00:31:48,868 --> 00:31:50,745
I'm sorry.

472
00:31:50,828 --> 00:31:52,747
He gave me the head.

473
00:31:57,376 --> 00:31:59,128
What do I do?

474
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,895
We made eye contact again!

475
00:32:15,978 --> 00:32:17,063
I'm done. You do it.

476
00:32:17,146 --> 00:32:18,314
- I can't.
- What now?

477
00:32:18,397 --> 00:32:19,565
Look at its eye.

478
00:32:19,649 --> 00:32:21,317
It's looking straight at me.

479
00:32:23,069 --> 00:32:24,528
Hi, guys.

480
00:32:26,239 --> 00:32:27,323
What's going on?

481
00:32:29,617 --> 00:32:30,493
What's happening?

482
00:32:30,576 --> 00:32:31,661
Da-eul.

483
00:32:35,831 --> 00:32:37,375
Gosh, it's tuna!

484
00:32:50,137 --> 00:32:51,889
It melts in my mouth.

485
00:32:52,473 --> 00:32:54,809
Da-eul, is there anything you can't do?

486
00:32:54,892 --> 00:32:55,893
Tell me about it.

487
00:32:55,977 --> 00:32:58,562
Look, she's so good
at making side dishes too.

488
00:32:58,646 --> 00:33:01,148
You'll see when you have children.
Mothers are amazing.

489
00:33:01,941 --> 00:33:04,277
Why would you eat
raw instant noodles over this?

490
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,820
I hate mushy stuff.

491
00:33:05,903 --> 00:33:08,823
Still, try one. If it's from the chairman,
it must be expensive.

492
00:33:10,616 --> 00:33:11,659
It was 700 million won.

493
00:33:12,451 --> 00:33:13,536
700 million?

494
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:14,912
Hey, spit it out.

495
00:33:15,413 --> 00:33:16,539
- Why?
- Hey.

496
00:33:16,622 --> 00:33:18,791
Most tunas are about five heads long,

497
00:33:18,874 --> 00:33:20,751
so the head alone is worth 140 million.

498
00:33:20,835 --> 00:33:22,128
That's worth more than our heads.

499
00:33:22,211 --> 00:33:23,629
- Let's sell this.
- Yes, let's.

500
00:33:24,547 --> 00:33:25,548
Hey.

501
00:33:25,631 --> 00:33:27,800
Do we know anyone
who'd pay that much for tuna?

502
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:29,427
No.

503
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:31,262
You could buy a house with that money.

504
00:33:31,345 --> 00:33:32,513
Right, so just eat.

505
00:33:32,596 --> 00:33:34,056
When else would we be able to eat this?

506
00:33:35,099 --> 00:33:36,767
If the head is 140 million won,

507
00:33:38,019 --> 00:33:40,521
one piece costs 2.4 million won.

508
00:33:42,648 --> 00:33:43,899
And now, 4.8 million.

509
00:33:43,983 --> 00:33:46,485
People who gulp these down
must live a happy life.

510
00:33:47,528 --> 00:33:48,529
I'm sure.

511
00:33:49,405 --> 00:33:50,656
They must be happy.

512
00:33:52,074 --> 00:33:53,659
- This is crazy.
- That's 12 million.

513
00:33:53,743 --> 00:33:55,536
- Okay, let's do it.
- Is it good?

514
00:33:55,619 --> 00:33:56,662
Totally.

515
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:01,667
Goodness.

516
00:34:06,005 --> 00:34:07,214
Come sleep at home today.

517
00:34:07,298 --> 00:34:09,759
- The hotel is more convenient.
- Come home.

518
00:34:09,842 --> 00:34:12,053
Let's have another drink at home.

519
00:34:24,273 --> 00:34:25,274
Are you coming home?

520
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:26,984
He told me to, so I should go.

521
00:34:27,068 --> 00:34:28,986
You should live your life as you please.

522
00:34:30,029 --> 00:34:32,531
Don't set your foot on rough terrain.

523
00:34:58,516 --> 00:34:59,850
Are you getting in?

524
00:34:59,934 --> 00:35:01,602
The chairman wants you at home.

525
00:35:02,228 --> 00:35:03,396
How impudent.

526
00:35:04,438 --> 00:35:05,773
You need to open the door for me.

527
00:35:11,737 --> 00:35:12,738
You know,

528
00:35:13,989 --> 00:35:15,991
people are quick
to catch onto bad behaviors.

529
00:35:18,035 --> 00:35:20,121
Please get in, sir.

530
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:24,834
This is it.

531
00:35:24,917 --> 00:35:26,168
It won't open any further.

532
00:35:28,087 --> 00:35:29,130
Go home.

533
00:35:29,213 --> 00:35:30,297
What? I can't go home.

534
00:35:30,381 --> 00:35:32,174
The chairman told me to bring you home.

535
00:35:32,258 --> 00:35:34,343
I can't. Mr. Gu!

536
00:35:52,445 --> 00:35:56,031
HOTEL CONCIERGE CHEON SA-RANG

537
00:36:02,163 --> 00:36:03,122
HOTEL CONCIERGE JOB FAIR

538
00:36:21,557 --> 00:36:23,476
Sa-rang, what are you drawing?

539
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:26,228
When we played at the beach, Mommy.

540
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,827
- Then what's this?
- A hotel.

541
00:36:41,911 --> 00:36:43,162
- A hotel?
- Yes.

542
00:36:43,245 --> 00:36:45,456
- It's a pink hotel.
- Yes.

543
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:51,170
Mommy, when I grow up,
I'm going to work at a hotel.

544
00:36:52,087 --> 00:36:53,756
- Really?
- Yes.

545
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:55,299
- Mommy.
- Yes?

546
00:36:55,382 --> 00:36:56,300
I love you.

547
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:30,626
HOTEL CONCIERGE CHEON SA-RANG

548
00:38:19,675 --> 00:38:22,928
PREPARING FOR OPENING

549
00:38:30,936 --> 00:38:32,563
- Ta-da!
- Ta-da!

550
00:38:32,646 --> 00:38:34,940
<i>- Congratulations
- Congratulations</i>

551
00:38:35,024 --> 00:38:37,651
<i>- Congratulations on your promotion
- Congratulations on your promotion</i>

552
00:38:38,986 --> 00:38:41,405
What's all this? Thank you.

553
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:42,948
Congrats on your promotion, Ms. Gang.

554
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:44,908
It's an honor, Ms. Gang.

555
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:46,702
Just call me Da-eul.

556
00:38:46,785 --> 00:38:48,454
It's weird to hear you call me Ms. Gang.

557
00:38:49,496 --> 00:38:50,706
Thank you.

558
00:38:51,707 --> 00:38:54,335
It's great to have you as our manager.

559
00:38:55,044 --> 00:38:57,546
Finally, spring is here for us.

560
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:58,797
Spring.

561
00:39:00,966 --> 00:39:03,969
Then let me share a word
as the new manager.

562
00:39:04,762 --> 00:39:07,181
From now on, let's each get our own lunch.

563
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:08,098
Okay?

564
00:39:10,267 --> 00:39:13,896
And this will be the last day
our junior member prepares snacks for us.

565
00:39:13,979 --> 00:39:14,938
What?

566
00:39:15,022 --> 00:39:18,025
I understand lunch,
but isn't that going too far?

567
00:39:18,651 --> 00:39:20,194
It's our tradition.

568
00:39:20,277 --> 00:39:23,739
If you abolish it now, what will become
of everyone who's upheld it thus far?

569
00:39:23,822 --> 00:39:26,950
Do you really think this tradition
is good enough to pass on?

570
00:39:27,534 --> 00:39:28,494
No.

571
00:39:28,577 --> 00:39:29,578
- No.
- No.

572
00:39:30,746 --> 00:39:33,415
We didn't get a job here to serve someone.

573
00:39:33,499 --> 00:39:36,460
Let's not fight over a weird tradition
that was made in the past.

574
00:39:36,543 --> 00:39:37,586
Okay?

575
00:39:38,337 --> 00:39:39,755
- Okay.
- Okay.

576
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:40,923
Thank you.

577
00:39:42,007 --> 00:39:44,009
Let's eat up and get ready to open.

578
00:39:47,554 --> 00:39:48,806
They look great on you.

579
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:50,349
Take them off. They're awful.

580
00:39:52,601 --> 00:39:54,603
Let's go. It's almost time.

581
00:39:54,687 --> 00:39:56,230
They look fine.

582
00:39:56,313 --> 00:39:59,149
Sir, those look great on you.

583
00:39:59,233 --> 00:40:00,401
You're like Brad Pitt.

584
00:40:02,403 --> 00:40:04,279
I wouldn't go that far.

585
00:40:05,406 --> 00:40:07,282
Brad Pitt, my foot.

586
00:40:07,366 --> 00:40:09,576
Hey, take them off. You look like a fly.

587
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,620
Goodness, a fly?

588
00:40:11,704 --> 00:40:14,289
Your friend must be jealous
that you look so good.

589
00:40:14,373 --> 00:40:17,251
- Me?
- And flies are wonderful, aren't they?

590
00:40:17,334 --> 00:40:21,213
They gleam in rainbow hues
and fly around freely through the sky.

591
00:40:21,922 --> 00:40:23,048
Isn't that cool?

592
00:40:23,841 --> 00:40:26,802
The moment you walk out with those,
everyone will fall for you.

593
00:40:26,885 --> 00:40:28,095
- Really?
- Hey.

594
00:40:28,595 --> 00:40:31,473
Don't make any impulse buys today
and just go.

595
00:40:31,557 --> 00:40:33,600
We have a lot of time before our flight.

596
00:40:33,684 --> 00:40:34,643
Right?

597
00:40:34,727 --> 00:40:38,939
Sir, these sunglasses are limited edition
and only sold in Korea.

598
00:40:39,022 --> 00:40:41,942
Our stocks are low,
so you may not find them next time.

599
00:40:42,526 --> 00:40:45,863
These look like they were
specially made for you.

600
00:40:45,946 --> 00:40:47,823
I'm afraid you may regret it later.

601
00:40:49,742 --> 00:40:50,659
I'll take them.

602
00:40:50,743 --> 00:40:52,703
Let me ring you up. This way, please.

603
00:40:52,786 --> 00:40:53,787
Thank you.

604
00:41:00,502 --> 00:41:03,005
Thank you, sir. Please come again.

605
00:41:10,763 --> 00:41:12,097
Hey, when did you get here?

606
00:41:12,181 --> 00:41:14,641
"Oh, my, sir. You're like Brad Pitt."

607
00:41:14,725 --> 00:41:15,893
Nonsense.

608
00:41:15,976 --> 00:41:18,228
Hey, it makes total sense.

609
00:41:18,312 --> 00:41:21,231
If he'll increase our sales,
he's better than Brad Pitt.

610
00:41:21,315 --> 00:41:23,150
Just stopping by? Or are you shopping?

611
00:41:24,234 --> 00:41:25,569
I'm not here to shop,

612
00:41:27,029 --> 00:41:29,907
but is there something I can give
as a token of gratitude?

613
00:41:32,534 --> 00:41:35,329
Are you sure it's a token of gratitude
and not a gift for a guy you're into?

614
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:37,998
- Forget it. I'm leaving.
- Oh, my.

615
00:41:38,081 --> 00:41:40,083
You can come in as you like,

616
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:43,128
but you can't leave empty-handed.
Buy something.

617
00:41:43,212 --> 00:41:44,713
No, maybe next time.

618
00:41:44,797 --> 00:41:47,758
Please, take a look at our scarves.

619
00:41:47,841 --> 00:41:50,886
These are wonderful products
recommended by the national mom.

620
00:41:55,974 --> 00:41:58,018
You have a reservation for a deluxe room

621
00:41:58,101 --> 00:42:00,103
- with a city view, right?
- Yes, that's right.

622
00:42:00,187 --> 00:42:03,106
Please upgrade the room to a suite.

623
00:42:04,107 --> 00:42:05,484
Shall I cancel the deluxe room

624
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:07,736
and change the reservation to a suite?

625
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:08,821
That's not it.

626
00:42:08,904 --> 00:42:10,948
The national mom, Ms. Mo Seong-ae,

627
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:13,408
is willing to stay here tonight,

628
00:42:13,492 --> 00:42:16,036
so just upgrade the room to a suite.

629
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:17,579
I'm sorry, sir.

630
00:42:17,663 --> 00:42:20,207
Our rules do not allow
an upgrade to a suite.

631
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:21,625
Move aside.

632
00:42:22,751 --> 00:42:25,170
- Do you know who I am?
- Yes, hello.

633
00:42:25,254 --> 00:42:27,631
I'll post a review
on social media as a favor.

634
00:42:27,714 --> 00:42:28,757
So get me a suite.

635
00:42:28,841 --> 00:42:31,176
Thank you for your special concern.

636
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:34,888
However, our rules do not allow us
to assist you in that way.

637
00:42:34,972 --> 00:42:37,558
If you enjoy wine,
may I offer you a pass for our lounge,

638
00:42:37,641 --> 00:42:41,061
where we serve simple snacks
along with wine, cocktails, and beer?

639
00:42:41,144 --> 00:42:45,190
Do you know how many followers I have?

640
00:42:45,274 --> 00:42:47,734
One word from me,
and you'll have to shut down.

641
00:42:48,902 --> 00:42:50,237
I'm so sorry.

642
00:42:51,238 --> 00:42:52,990
You really don't get it, do you?

643
00:42:53,532 --> 00:42:54,533
Get your manager.

644
00:42:55,158 --> 00:42:56,410
I want the desk manager!

645
00:42:58,161 --> 00:43:00,873
Our manager is not here at the moment.

646
00:43:00,956 --> 00:43:02,708
What's with these interview questions?

647
00:43:03,208 --> 00:43:05,586
- What do you mean?
- Look, they're so juvenile.

648
00:43:06,295 --> 00:43:07,754
I didn't come up with them.

649
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:09,339
Tell them to redo it.

650
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:12,634
Just go along with it.
Why are you pretending to work?

651
00:43:12,718 --> 00:43:13,844
It's unlike you.

652
00:43:13,927 --> 00:43:15,512
I might as well do a good job.

653
00:43:16,305 --> 00:43:18,557
Tell them to give me some real questions.

654
00:43:19,308 --> 00:43:20,183
Yes, sir.

655
00:43:20,267 --> 00:43:22,936
If your manager isn't here,
bring someone else in charge!

656
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:25,439
It's not like I'm asking for much.

657
00:43:25,522 --> 00:43:27,190
I just want to talk to the manager.

658
00:43:27,274 --> 00:43:28,692
Who are you to stop me?

659
00:43:28,775 --> 00:43:30,777
- That's Mo Seong-ae.
- The manager isn't here.

660
00:43:30,861 --> 00:43:32,613
I'm in charge of check-ins.

661
00:43:32,696 --> 00:43:33,906
Feel free to talk to me.

662
00:43:33,989 --> 00:43:35,365
Are you a parrot?

663
00:43:35,449 --> 00:43:38,118
You're repeating the same words
over and over again!

664
00:43:39,161 --> 00:43:40,245
What's going on?

665
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:43,498
- Nothing, sir.
- Doesn't seem like it.

666
00:43:43,582 --> 00:43:44,875
Are you the desk manager?

667
00:43:44,958 --> 00:43:47,419
- No.
- Then why are you butting in?

668
00:43:47,502 --> 00:43:48,962
Why isn't there a manager here?

669
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,426
I asked you what was going on.

670
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:58,180
She reserved a deluxe room,

671
00:43:58,263 --> 00:44:00,223
but she wanted an upgrade to a suite.

672
00:44:00,307 --> 00:44:01,892
Charge her extra and do it.

673
00:44:02,726 --> 00:44:03,727
That's not it.

674
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:08,732
This guest right here
is a famous actress, Mo Seong-ae.

675
00:44:08,815 --> 00:44:11,860
She said she'd give us publicity
if we offered a free upgrade,

676
00:44:11,944 --> 00:44:14,154
so I explained that
our rules did not allow that.

677
00:44:14,237 --> 00:44:17,157
Ms. Mo Seong-ae, the national mom.

678
00:44:18,909 --> 00:44:20,744
How long have you worked here?

679
00:44:20,827 --> 00:44:21,662
Seven years, sir.

680
00:44:21,745 --> 00:44:24,456
Yet you still can't handle
a rude guest like her?

681
00:44:24,539 --> 00:44:25,958
What? A rude guest?

682
00:44:26,041 --> 00:44:27,250
The so-called national mom

683
00:44:27,334 --> 00:44:29,628
made a scene to stay in a nice room
without paying for it.

684
00:44:29,711 --> 00:44:31,546
Why not tell her she's being a thief?

685
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:33,423
Get security and kick her out.

686
00:44:33,507 --> 00:44:35,467
Hey! Who do you think you are?

687
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:38,679
Save the rest for our security officers.
They'll be here shortly.

688
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:42,099
Hey! You!

689
00:44:42,182 --> 00:44:43,684
Stop right there! Hey, you!

690
00:44:43,767 --> 00:44:44,810
Ms. Mo.

691
00:44:44,893 --> 00:44:47,312
- Lots of people are watching.
- So what?

692
00:44:47,396 --> 00:44:49,147
I didn't do anything wrong!

693
00:44:49,231 --> 00:44:50,732
Let them all come and see!

694
00:44:50,816 --> 00:44:54,528
It won't do you any good
if people upload this on the internet.

695
00:44:54,611 --> 00:44:55,737
I'm so pissed.

696
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:59,324
That damn internet is everything now.

697
00:45:02,911 --> 00:45:03,954
Fine.

698
00:45:04,037 --> 00:45:07,916
I normally wouldn't care
if I didn't get that suite upgrade,

699
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,294
but I will make sure to get it today.

700
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:13,380
I'm so sorry.

701
00:45:13,463 --> 00:45:15,090
You keep talking about these rules,

702
00:45:15,173 --> 00:45:17,092
so what are the rules?

703
00:45:17,175 --> 00:45:19,010
Tell me the article and clause!

704
00:45:19,094 --> 00:45:20,387
I'm so sorry.

705
00:45:20,971 --> 00:45:23,849
I don't need your apology.
Give me the room!

706
00:45:23,932 --> 00:45:26,351
- Ms. Cheon, my office. Now.
- Sorry?

707
00:45:27,227 --> 00:45:28,729
Didn't you hear me?

708
00:45:28,812 --> 00:45:30,480
Come to my office. Now.

709
00:45:30,564 --> 00:45:31,565
Hey!

710
00:45:31,648 --> 00:45:33,859
I'm talking to her right now.

711
00:45:35,152 --> 00:45:36,153
Over there. Manager.

712
00:45:39,531 --> 00:45:41,074
Yes, hello, Mr. Gu.

713
00:45:41,158 --> 00:45:43,118
It's your duty as the manager
to protect the staff.

714
00:45:43,201 --> 00:45:44,536
What are you doing?

715
00:45:44,619 --> 00:45:46,788
- Call security.
- Yes, sir.

716
00:45:47,622 --> 00:45:48,707
Do your job.

717
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:51,293
What? You're the manager?

718
00:45:52,878 --> 00:45:54,755
You were here all along,

719
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:57,007
but you were hiding and watching?

720
00:45:57,924 --> 00:45:59,551
What's your name?

721
00:46:00,051 --> 00:46:02,387
How may I help you?

722
00:46:02,471 --> 00:46:05,223
Do you expect me
to repeat everything again?

723
00:46:05,307 --> 00:46:06,600
This is so annoying.

724
00:46:06,683 --> 00:46:09,770
It's me, Mo Seong-ae!

725
00:46:09,853 --> 00:46:13,231
INTERVIEW QUESTIONS
FOR HEAD MANAGER GU WON

726
00:46:18,862 --> 00:46:22,032
If there's nothing else for me to do…

727
00:46:22,115 --> 00:46:24,618
Don't we have a manual
against rude customers?

728
00:46:24,701 --> 00:46:26,745
Why do you put up with such nonsense?

729
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:31,666
We must remain hospitable
no matter what the circumstances.

730
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:33,293
But circumstances do differ.

731
00:46:33,376 --> 00:46:35,670
Weren't you the outspoken type
who spoke her mind with a smile?

732
00:46:35,754 --> 00:46:37,130
Even if we aren't at fault,

733
00:46:37,214 --> 00:46:39,257
it's in our manual
to apologize to our guests

734
00:46:39,341 --> 00:46:41,676
and make sure
they don't leave feeling offended.

735
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,428
What kind of a manual is that?

736
00:46:44,137 --> 00:46:45,222
Who made that?

737
00:46:45,305 --> 00:46:46,848
The higher-ups, I'm sure.

738
00:46:46,932 --> 00:46:48,016
People like you.

739
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:51,561
I'm quite outspoken outside of work.

740
00:46:51,645 --> 00:46:54,940
But at the hotel,
I'm not Cheon Sa-rang, but a concierge.

741
00:46:55,023 --> 00:46:56,691
My job is to stay professional

742
00:46:56,775 --> 00:46:59,528
and resolve complaints from guests
in an amicable way.

743
00:47:08,411 --> 00:47:11,122
If you have nothing more to say,
please excuse me.

744
00:47:13,708 --> 00:47:14,960
Don't ask me anything.

745
00:47:17,087 --> 00:47:20,799
Favorite color. Favorite weather.
Favorite food. Everything.

746
00:47:20,882 --> 00:47:21,925
I don't like anything.

747
00:47:22,592 --> 00:47:23,552
I never asked.

748
00:47:23,635 --> 00:47:25,136
- You will.
- I won't.

749
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:27,222
- What will you ask, then?
- Why should I?

750
00:47:27,305 --> 00:47:28,890
You aren't going to do the interview?

751
00:47:28,974 --> 00:47:29,808
What interview?

752
00:47:35,021 --> 00:47:35,939
Mr. No.

753
00:47:39,234 --> 00:47:41,111
Why doesn't she know about the interview?

754
00:47:41,194 --> 00:47:42,571
I only gave you the proposal.

755
00:47:42,654 --> 00:47:44,197
What about Ms. Cheon?

756
00:47:44,281 --> 00:47:45,699
Only you need to look over it.

757
00:47:45,782 --> 00:47:47,659
Employees must do as they're told. Right?

758
00:47:48,243 --> 00:47:49,202
I'm done checking.

759
00:47:49,828 --> 00:47:50,912
I won't do it!

760
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:52,747
You must.

761
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:54,249
It's the chairman's order.

762
00:47:54,332 --> 00:47:56,585
Why do I have to do that like a clown?

763
00:47:56,668 --> 00:47:58,128
The chairman of New World

764
00:47:58,211 --> 00:47:59,796
and the daughter of Ttukbaegi

765
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:03,049
share their everyday lives online,
including how they eat, cook, and shop.

766
00:48:03,133 --> 00:48:05,510
In this day and age,
public image is a warzone.

767
00:48:05,594 --> 00:48:07,095
This time, you'll go to war

768
00:48:07,178 --> 00:48:08,638
on behalf of our group

769
00:48:08,722 --> 00:48:10,599
along with our kind Ms. Sa-rang.

770
00:48:10,682 --> 00:48:12,517
- "War"?
- Why would I go to war

771
00:48:12,601 --> 00:48:13,768
with a kind person?

772
00:48:13,852 --> 00:48:15,520
I need a good fighter!

773
00:48:16,688 --> 00:48:17,731
I'm going to war?

774
00:48:19,733 --> 00:48:21,109
She looks like a good fighter.

775
00:48:22,819 --> 00:48:24,529
Look at that. Did you do taekwondo?

776
00:48:24,613 --> 00:48:26,489
- These idiots.
- I've never heard that.

777
00:48:30,869 --> 00:48:33,622
So I have to do
a live promotional show with Mr. Gu,

778
00:48:33,705 --> 00:48:35,165
- and it'll air on CNBS?
- Yes.

779
00:48:35,248 --> 00:48:37,083
I told you about the promo video.

780
00:48:37,167 --> 00:48:40,420
How is a promo video
the same as a live show on CNBS?

781
00:48:40,503 --> 00:48:42,297
In essence, they're all promo videos.

782
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:43,840
And you won't have to do much.

783
00:48:43,924 --> 00:48:45,383
You'll just read off the script.

784
00:48:45,467 --> 00:48:48,595
But still, how could you
not have told me anything?

785
00:48:48,678 --> 00:48:50,430
Show me. I need to look over it too.

786
00:48:51,139 --> 00:48:52,057
Sa-rang.

787
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:54,100
We aren't here to look over things.

788
00:48:54,184 --> 00:48:55,602
We're here to do as we're told.

789
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:57,938
But…

790
00:48:59,606 --> 00:49:00,982
what's with the casual tone?

791
00:49:01,942 --> 00:49:02,776
Did I do that?

792
00:49:03,401 --> 00:49:04,361
I did.

793
00:49:04,444 --> 00:49:05,570
Is it because I'm older?

794
00:49:05,654 --> 00:49:08,114
That must be why.
You can talk casually too.

795
00:49:08,198 --> 00:49:09,157
Okay, Sang-sik.

796
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:11,618
Give me the proposal and the script.

797
00:49:12,285 --> 00:49:13,954
I know I should do as I'm told,

798
00:49:14,037 --> 00:49:16,206
but I need to know.
I'm a person, not a puppet.

799
00:49:16,289 --> 00:49:18,041
It's not that I won't give it to you--

800
00:49:18,124 --> 00:49:19,709
Then bring it to the lobby soon.

801
00:49:19,793 --> 00:49:21,086
I'm busy, so I have to go.

802
00:49:26,967 --> 00:49:28,760
Please excuse me, sir.

803
00:49:37,394 --> 00:49:39,521
How do they pick the best talent?

804
00:49:39,604 --> 00:49:40,689
Is that so important?

805
00:49:41,356 --> 00:49:42,857
Did you just see that?

806
00:49:42,941 --> 00:49:43,817
What?

807
00:49:45,276 --> 00:49:47,529
We're on a first-name basis
in under five minutes.

808
00:49:48,154 --> 00:49:50,115
My skills make my life so difficult.

809
00:49:50,782 --> 00:49:51,950
It's killing me.

810
00:49:54,369 --> 00:49:55,578
- Get out.
- Yes, sir.

811
00:50:18,727 --> 00:50:19,602
Babe.

812
00:50:19,686 --> 00:50:21,813
Look behind you. A killer view, right?

813
00:50:22,647 --> 00:50:24,315
Yes, it's killing me.

814
00:50:25,775 --> 00:50:28,319
Why did we get out of the taxi
before we reached the top?

815
00:50:28,403 --> 00:50:30,155
I did it for you.

816
00:50:30,238 --> 00:50:33,158
You're always standing at the hotel,
so you should work out.

817
00:50:33,241 --> 00:50:34,951
Almost there. Keep it up!

818
00:50:36,494 --> 00:50:37,787
This is nice!

819
00:50:39,664 --> 00:50:40,707
Darn it.

820
00:50:50,467 --> 00:50:51,509
This is nice.

821
00:50:54,387 --> 00:50:55,847
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

822
00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:58,224
We first talked about coming here
last winter.

823
00:50:58,308 --> 00:50:59,350
Remember?

824
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:02,020
It's me.

825
00:51:02,896 --> 00:51:04,606
No, it's fine. Go ahead.

826
00:51:04,689 --> 00:51:05,857
Yes.

827
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:07,567
Really? Everyone's there?

828
00:51:08,777 --> 00:51:10,320
Okay, I'll be there soon.

829
00:51:10,403 --> 00:51:11,279
Bye.

830
00:51:13,948 --> 00:51:15,116
If you're done, let's go.

831
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:17,243
Is this a joke? We just got here.

832
00:51:17,327 --> 00:51:18,787
I forgot that I had a reunion.

833
00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:20,830
They're begging me to come.
You should come too.

834
00:51:20,914 --> 00:51:23,500
No. I feel uncomfortable around strangers.

835
00:51:23,583 --> 00:51:25,210
It's fine. They're all my friends.

836
00:51:25,293 --> 00:51:26,961
Let's hang the lock and go.

837
00:51:27,796 --> 00:51:28,797
No, I…

838
00:51:29,297 --> 00:51:32,217
SA-RANG ♡ YU-NAM

839
00:51:37,847 --> 00:51:39,557
Let us love forever!

840
00:51:46,523 --> 00:51:47,732
What did you just throw?

841
00:51:51,611 --> 00:51:53,071
As long as we hang something.

842
00:51:54,781 --> 00:51:56,991
You can't just laugh it off right now.

843
00:51:57,075 --> 00:51:58,118
It's still nice.

844
00:51:58,201 --> 00:51:59,994
This is the key to our love.

845
00:52:02,497 --> 00:52:03,915
Let's go.

846
00:52:03,998 --> 00:52:05,375
No, you can go alone.

847
00:52:06,918 --> 00:52:08,044
I'm sorry.

848
00:52:08,128 --> 00:52:09,754
Let's leave right after we say hi.

849
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:10,880
Please?

850
00:52:15,009 --> 00:52:16,678
We're leaving right away.

851
00:52:16,761 --> 00:52:18,221
Sure. It won't even take a minute.

852
00:52:18,304 --> 00:52:19,430
Let's go.

853
00:52:33,236 --> 00:52:36,197
Yo!

854
00:52:39,909 --> 00:52:41,411
Did you go to an all-girls high school?

855
00:52:41,494 --> 00:52:42,620
Come here.

856
00:52:44,205 --> 00:52:45,248
Say hi to her.

857
00:52:45,331 --> 00:52:46,416
This is my girlfriend.

858
00:52:47,333 --> 00:52:48,251
Hello.

859
00:52:49,252 --> 00:52:50,170
Be nice to her.

860
00:52:52,589 --> 00:52:55,258
Hey Yu-nam, come and have a drink.

861
00:52:55,341 --> 00:52:57,385
- Hey, it's you.
- Come on!

862
00:52:57,468 --> 00:52:58,511
Be right there.

863
00:52:58,595 --> 00:53:00,805
I'll go say hi to them.
Have fun with the girls.

864
00:53:00,889 --> 00:53:02,140
Don't say anything weird.

865
00:53:02,223 --> 00:53:03,141
I'm watching you.

866
00:53:03,224 --> 00:53:04,642
- Fine.
- Fine.

867
00:53:04,726 --> 00:53:06,269
- He's impossible.
- Goodness.

868
00:53:06,895 --> 00:53:08,021
- Have some.
- Okay.

869
00:53:11,232 --> 00:53:13,902
- I'm here now!
<i>- Hit it!</i>

870
00:53:14,611 --> 00:53:16,321
- You're here.
- It's been so long.

871
00:53:16,404 --> 00:53:18,740
- Three drinks for a latecomer.
- You still do this?

872
00:53:18,823 --> 00:53:20,325
- Chug!
- Chug!

873
00:53:20,408 --> 00:53:22,202
- Chug!
- Chug!

874
00:53:23,077 --> 00:53:24,704
- Hey!
- Another round!

875
00:53:24,787 --> 00:53:25,830
Hurry up.

876
00:53:48,269 --> 00:53:49,562
How long have you two dated?

877
00:53:49,646 --> 00:53:50,521
Sorry?

878
00:53:53,107 --> 00:53:54,817
Just over a year now.

879
00:53:54,901 --> 00:53:55,985
I can't believe it.

880
00:53:56,069 --> 00:53:57,987
- He's never lasted three months.
- I know, right?

881
00:53:58,488 --> 00:54:00,031
Do you always talk like that?

882
00:54:00,907 --> 00:54:03,451
- Are you acting cute to seem younger?
- Stop it.

883
00:54:03,534 --> 00:54:04,410
What?

884
00:54:04,494 --> 00:54:06,537
Right, Seon-mi is getting married.

885
00:54:06,621 --> 00:54:07,872
- What? To who?
- Yes.

886
00:54:07,956 --> 00:54:09,749
Do you remember Gwang-ho in our class?

887
00:54:09,832 --> 00:54:12,502
- No way. She's marrying him?
- No, his dad!

888
00:54:12,585 --> 00:54:14,295
What? No way!

889
00:54:19,342 --> 00:54:20,510
No, you're it!

890
00:54:22,679 --> 00:54:25,223
<i>-Bunny, bunny
-Bunny, bunny</i>

891
00:54:25,306 --> 00:54:26,140
You lost!

892
00:54:30,103 --> 00:54:32,730
- Chug!
- I had too much to drink!

893
00:54:32,814 --> 00:54:34,399
- Chug!
- Chug!

894
00:54:34,482 --> 00:54:35,650
- Chug!
- Chug!

895
00:54:35,733 --> 00:54:38,194
<i>- How long will you make us dance?
- How long will you make us dance?</i>

896
00:54:38,278 --> 00:54:39,946
<i>- Look at my shoulder</i>
- Look at my shoulder</i>

897
00:54:40,029 --> 00:54:41,489
- Hey.
- Where are you going?

898
00:54:41,572 --> 00:54:43,241
- Hey, wait!
- Hey!

899
00:54:46,035 --> 00:54:46,953
Sa-rang.

900
00:54:51,207 --> 00:54:52,166
You're leaving?

901
00:54:52,792 --> 00:54:54,294
You said we'd just say hi and go.

902
00:54:55,003 --> 00:54:56,129
Sorry. Are you sulking?

903
00:54:56,212 --> 00:54:57,130
I'm mad.

904
00:54:57,213 --> 00:54:59,215
I'm wondering if I should keep dating you.

905
00:55:00,091 --> 00:55:01,509
I'm sorry. It's just been so long…

906
00:55:01,592 --> 00:55:04,095
I'm leaving. We can talk later. Have fun.

907
00:55:04,178 --> 00:55:06,014
Wait, let me take you home.

908
00:55:06,097 --> 00:55:08,349
I'll say goodbye and come out.

909
00:55:08,433 --> 00:55:09,350
Wait for me.

910
00:55:13,438 --> 00:55:15,398
Hey, I have to go.

911
00:55:15,481 --> 00:55:18,234
- Why?
- Don't go.

912
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:20,111
- Come on, stay.
- I really have to go.

913
00:55:20,862 --> 00:55:22,613
- No, wait.
- Don't be like that.

914
00:55:22,697 --> 00:55:24,449
- Do you need me?
- We do!

915
00:55:24,532 --> 00:55:26,743
Then just one last drink.

916
00:55:29,912 --> 00:55:31,998
Wait, I really have to go.

917
00:55:32,081 --> 00:55:33,291
- Come on!
- No!

918
00:55:33,374 --> 00:55:36,127
- Hey, no.
- Someone grab him.

919
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:38,087
<i>- Yu-nam's favorite game!

Hello.

934
00:59:46,627 --> 00:59:47,545
Mr. Gu.

935
00:59:47,628 --> 00:59:49,005
Hello.

936
00:59:49,088 --> 00:59:50,131
Yes, hello…

937
00:59:52,341 --> 00:59:53,926
Look at the time. You're late!

938
00:59:54,927 --> 00:59:56,345
I'm here on time.

939
00:59:56,929 --> 00:59:58,139
Hey, our kind Ms. Sa-rang.

940
00:59:59,348 --> 01:00:01,434
- You're here on time.
- Hello.

941
01:00:03,227 --> 01:00:05,479
- Are you two close?
- We are.

942
01:00:05,563 --> 01:00:06,814
We're on a first-name basis.

943
01:00:08,190 --> 01:00:09,567
Don't fool around at work.

944
01:00:10,151 --> 01:00:12,236
And enough with this first-name basis.

945
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:13,738
Why not?

946
01:00:13,821 --> 01:00:14,697
It's not the office.

947
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:17,241
I don't care where we are. Just stop it!

948
01:00:18,492 --> 01:00:20,161
Our kind Ms. Sa-rang, follow me with this.

949
01:00:26,429 --> 01:00:28,098
Our kind Ms. Sa-rang, follow me with this.

950
01:00:34,249 --> 01:00:35,250
Ouch.

951
01:00:37,461 --> 01:00:38,587
Hey, miss.

952
01:00:39,505 --> 01:00:40,506
Is this yours?

953
01:00:41,507 --> 01:00:42,466
No.

954
01:00:42,966 --> 01:00:44,134
That's his.

955
01:00:44,218 --> 01:00:45,385
It's his suitcase.

956
01:00:45,469 --> 01:00:46,929
Hey, young man.

957
01:00:47,012 --> 01:00:47,888
Come here.

958
01:00:49,932 --> 01:00:51,767
Come over here.

959
01:00:56,855 --> 01:00:58,065
What are you doing?

960
01:00:58,148 --> 01:01:00,359
You should take care of your own suitcase.

961
01:01:00,859 --> 01:01:03,862
Aren't you supposed to assist me
as my subordinate?

962
01:01:03,946 --> 01:01:05,072
I'm sorry,

963
01:01:05,155 --> 01:01:07,741
but I'm here for the promo video,
not as your porter.

964
01:01:07,824 --> 01:01:08,951
Please excuse me.

965
01:01:09,826 --> 01:01:11,703
I hope you two have a great talk.

966
01:01:12,621 --> 01:01:13,580
It's him.

967
01:01:15,958 --> 01:01:17,000
I'm sorry.

968
01:01:17,084 --> 01:01:18,377
I'm frightened.

969
01:01:18,877 --> 01:01:21,255
- No Sang-sik…
- Are you three messing around?

970
01:01:21,338 --> 01:01:24,424
You still haven't apologized
after you hit me.

971
01:01:26,093 --> 01:01:27,135
Hey.

972
01:01:27,219 --> 01:01:28,428
Get over here.

973
01:01:48,323 --> 01:01:49,449
I apologize.

974
01:01:50,909 --> 01:01:52,327
Is this enough?

975
01:01:53,203 --> 01:01:56,623
Do you think money is the answer
to all problems, you young little…

976
01:01:57,583 --> 01:01:59,251
ONE MILLION WON

977
01:02:00,669 --> 01:02:02,754
- Do you need change?
- No.

978
01:02:02,838 --> 01:02:03,922
No?

979
01:02:05,048 --> 01:02:07,384
Do you need a hand with this?

980
01:02:07,467 --> 01:02:09,094
You don't seem very well.

981
01:02:09,177 --> 01:02:11,179
- This is heavy.
- And a no to that too.

982
01:02:11,763 --> 01:02:13,223
- Thank you.
- Sure.

983
01:02:24,276 --> 01:02:25,235
You two.

984
01:02:44,838 --> 01:02:46,256
The car is ready.

985
01:02:49,551 --> 01:02:51,053
Is this our car?

986
01:02:51,762 --> 01:02:52,804
Haven't you seen one before?

987
01:02:52,888 --> 01:02:54,139
No, it's my first time!

988
01:02:54,681 --> 01:02:56,683
Then you're in for a surprise.

989
01:02:59,269 --> 01:03:00,854
Gosh, it's so loud.

990
01:03:02,481 --> 01:03:03,523
It's best to ride it

991
01:03:04,232 --> 01:03:08,445
under the scorching sun of Las Vegas
against a rough sandstorm.

992
01:03:09,196 --> 01:03:12,574
This isn't Vegas,
but you're in for a special treat.

993
01:03:12,658 --> 01:03:13,742
Watch this.

994
01:03:20,624 --> 01:03:22,084
See? Isn't this something?

995
01:03:22,167 --> 01:03:23,919
We're in for a good ride.

996
01:03:24,002 --> 01:03:25,253
This is so cool.

997
01:03:28,507 --> 01:03:31,093
Mr. Gu, the door is locked.

998
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:35,931
You two can find
your own way to the hotel.

999
01:03:45,732 --> 01:03:48,068
Sa-rang, let's grab a cab.

1000
01:03:48,151 --> 01:03:49,528
I'll get one.

1001
01:03:49,611 --> 01:03:50,654
Okay.

1002
01:04:11,633 --> 01:04:13,218
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

1003
01:04:20,225 --> 01:04:22,144
Sir, please drive slowly.

1004
01:04:58,513 --> 01:05:00,182
It's so pretty.

1005
01:05:14,237 --> 01:05:16,198
FATHER

1006
01:05:18,116 --> 01:05:18,992
Hello?

1007
01:05:19,075 --> 01:05:22,162
<i>This is a business channel
that broadcasts worldwide.</i>

1008
01:05:22,245 --> 01:05:23,747
This is not only a promotion,

1009
01:05:24,456 --> 01:05:27,417
but also a symbolic statement
that you'll be joining our group.

1010
01:05:28,418 --> 01:05:29,878
<i>And your performance</i>

1011
01:05:29,961 --> 01:05:32,714
will have an effect
on King Group's stock price as well.

1012
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:35,050
Put on a good show.

1013
01:05:50,941 --> 01:05:52,192
Move that over.

1014
01:05:53,193 --> 01:05:54,194
Everyone, get ready.

1015
01:06:10,252 --> 01:06:11,837
FAVORITE VACATION SPOT?

1016
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,213

1017
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:17,175
Did you get the questions
from the PR team?

1018
01:06:17,259 --> 01:06:18,677
Yes, I did.

1019
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:20,804
You should take this instead.

1020
01:06:20,887 --> 01:06:22,264
This is the finalized list.

1021
01:06:23,431 --> 01:06:24,766
It changed? We're about to begin.

1022
01:06:24,850 --> 01:06:27,143
It was just sent
from the managing director's office.

1023
01:06:27,227 --> 01:06:30,021
We'll edit all the shots,
so feel free to read off of it.

1024
01:06:30,689 --> 01:06:31,690
Okay.

<i>Smile, king.</i>

1031
01:09:43,882 --> 01:09:46,718
<i>He's begging you to smile.
Can't you smile just once?</i>

1032
01:09:47,385 --> 01:09:48,219
<i>I don't want to.</i>

1033
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:52,307
Oh, so you're good at everything,
but you can't smile.

1034
01:09:53,892 --> 01:09:55,435
<i>I said I'm choosing not to.</i>

1035
01:09:55,518 --> 01:09:56,519
Smile!

1036
01:09:59,522 --> 01:10:00,648
<i>Get on this boat?</i>

1037
01:10:00,732 --> 01:10:02,609
I don't want to go with just him.

1038
01:10:02,692 --> 01:10:04,444
I don't want to go with you either.

1039
01:10:05,070 --> 01:10:06,279
Are you on your honeymoon?

1040
01:10:06,821 --> 01:10:07,781
- No.
- No!

1041
01:10:07,864 --> 01:10:08,698
Goodness!

1042
01:10:11,743 --> 01:10:12,577
