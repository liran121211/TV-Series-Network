1
00:00:02,446 --> 00:00:06,920
KING THE LAND

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,854
KING THE LAND

3
00:00:12,193 --> 00:00:13,806
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

4
00:00:13,887 --> 00:00:15,626
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

5
00:00:22,799 --> 00:00:23,883
What happened?

6
00:00:23,967 --> 00:00:25,635
There's nothing they can do
in this bad weather.

7
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:28,054
They'll resume the search when it clears…

8
00:00:28,138 --> 00:00:29,305
No, it'll be too late.

9
00:00:29,389 --> 00:00:30,765
They already pulled out.

10
00:00:30,849 --> 00:00:31,808
You should wait.

11
00:00:33,351 --> 00:00:34,435
Get the helicopter.

12
00:00:35,061 --> 00:00:36,020
The helicopter?

13
00:00:36,104 --> 00:00:37,105
What helicopter?

14
00:00:37,188 --> 00:00:38,648
How am I going to do that?

15
00:00:38,731 --> 00:00:40,441
And what will you do with it?

16
00:00:40,525 --> 00:00:41,359
I should go.

17
00:00:41,442 --> 00:00:43,403
You can't fly there in this lousy weather.

18
00:00:43,903 --> 00:00:46,364
And you can't use it
without Ms. Gu's permission.

19
00:00:51,077 --> 00:00:52,912
Are you saying there's a risk?

20
00:00:52,996 --> 00:00:57,083
At first, it may look like
the revenues are going up,

21
00:00:57,167 --> 00:00:58,585
but it's only an illusion.

22
00:00:58,668 --> 00:01:01,129
In the long run,
the net profit is bound to drop--

23
00:01:01,212 --> 00:01:03,256
Are you saying I'm wrong?

24
00:01:04,883 --> 00:01:06,134
Oh, no.

25
00:01:06,217 --> 00:01:08,845
Do I lack long-term perspective
on our business?

26
00:01:09,929 --> 00:01:10,805
No, ma'am.

27
00:01:10,889 --> 00:01:13,182
Which means
what I've done so far is right.

28
00:01:13,266 --> 00:01:14,684
Yes, ma'am.

29
00:01:16,227 --> 00:01:18,563
If I'm right and all of you are wrong,

30
00:01:19,606 --> 00:01:21,274
why are you all sitting here?

31
00:01:25,361 --> 00:01:27,947
Retailing is a tug-of-war
between stability and venture.

32
00:01:28,531 --> 00:01:30,617
In order to prove our investment in Alanga

33
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,453
hasn't just been a venturous move…

34
00:01:37,707 --> 00:01:38,541
What do you want?

35
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:39,792
I need a helicopter.

36
00:01:39,876 --> 00:01:40,919
I'm in a meeting.

37
00:01:41,002 --> 00:01:42,086
One of our staff is missing.

38
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,005
- I received the report.
- Then what?

39
00:01:45,089 --> 00:01:46,716
This meeting isn't for that matter.

40
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:47,759
So?

41
00:01:48,968 --> 00:01:49,969
I need the helicopter.

42
00:01:50,053 --> 00:01:51,221
I hear I need your permission.

43
00:01:57,518 --> 00:01:58,645
Mr. Gu.

44
00:01:58,728 --> 00:02:02,440
Is there anybody here
who holds a position lower than you?

45
00:02:03,316 --> 00:02:06,444
You've acted cheeky enough
as the chairman's son today.

46
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:10,031
If you need my approval,
stick to the formal procedures.

47
00:02:17,664 --> 00:02:19,207
I apologize for my intrusion.

48
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,251
One of our staff
is stranded in the mountains.

49
00:02:21,834 --> 00:02:24,754
She isn't answering her phone,
but her location can be tracked.

50
00:02:25,338 --> 00:02:27,423
The search was suspended
due to the weather.

51
00:02:27,507 --> 00:02:28,341
That's why I need

52
00:02:28,967 --> 00:02:30,301
the company's helicopter.

53
00:02:30,385 --> 00:02:31,719
Okay. We'll talk later.

54
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,972
- Ms.Gu.
- Get out.

55
00:02:34,055 --> 00:02:36,140
- I have no time for that.
- Nobody here does.

56
00:02:36,641 --> 00:02:39,268
Don't you see that
we're in a meeting right now?

57
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,363
Please.

58
00:02:52,365 --> 00:02:55,076
No company would use its helicopter
to find a mere employee.

59
00:02:56,035 --> 00:02:58,496
Do you know how much
a helicopter flight costs?

60
00:02:58,579 --> 00:02:59,872
Come to your senses.

61
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:02,792
Hwa-ran.

62
00:03:04,627 --> 00:03:06,170
You're the one who sent them.

63
00:03:07,296 --> 00:03:10,425
If you were going to be so anxious,
you shouldn't have sent them.

64
00:03:13,094 --> 00:03:13,928
Let's continue.

65
00:03:14,012 --> 00:03:15,638
Where were we?

66
00:03:15,722 --> 00:03:18,766
That our investment in Alanga
wasn't just a venturous move.

67
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:22,729
I always wanted to turn Alanga
into a world-famous luxury brand.

68
00:03:23,396 --> 00:03:24,897
- To do that--
- It's all a dream.

69
00:03:27,025 --> 00:03:28,776
A company that's too busy making money

70
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:31,654
to care about the safety of its employee

71
00:03:31,738 --> 00:03:33,698
can't possibly turn into a luxury brand.

72
00:03:35,325 --> 00:03:36,743
It's nothing but a vain dream.

73
00:03:36,826 --> 00:03:38,786
Such big words from a guy without one.

74
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:39,871
Right?

75
00:03:39,954 --> 00:03:42,165
I'll get the helicopter running.

76
00:03:42,749 --> 00:03:44,709
I'll show you how cheeky I can get.

77
00:03:47,962 --> 00:03:49,630
Make a fortune, everyone.

78
00:03:54,344 --> 00:03:56,179
Get the helicopter running now.

79
00:03:56,888 --> 00:03:58,806
I know Ms. Gu Hwa-ran hasn't approved.

80
00:04:00,141 --> 00:04:01,476
I'm Gu Won.

81
00:04:02,018 --> 00:04:03,269
I'll take responsibility.

82
00:04:04,354 --> 00:04:06,439
You had to fight her someday,
so great job.

83
00:04:06,522 --> 00:04:09,108
Ms. Gu won't boss you around
after you put your foot down.

84
00:04:09,192 --> 00:04:11,944
You've put up a good fight
in your first power game.

85
00:04:12,028 --> 00:04:13,446
This is about saving a life.

86
00:04:13,529 --> 00:04:14,489
It's not about power.

87
00:04:15,198 --> 00:04:16,866
You need power to save people.

88
00:04:17,617 --> 00:04:18,951
You should go home.

89
00:04:19,035 --> 00:04:20,411
I'll update you on her rescue.

90
00:04:21,037 --> 00:04:22,121
I'm not going home.

91
00:04:22,205 --> 00:04:24,082
There's nothing more you can do here.

92
00:04:24,165 --> 00:04:25,416
I'll stay.

93
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,168
I'm going.

94
00:04:30,421 --> 00:04:31,881
Are you insane? In this weather?

95
00:04:31,964 --> 00:04:33,174
I know you're blinded by love,

96
00:04:33,257 --> 00:04:34,675
- but this is wrong!
- Let go.

97
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:37,762
What will become of me
if something happens to you?

98
00:04:38,471 --> 00:04:40,556
You're my only connection at work!

99
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,809
As I said, you picked the wrong man.

100
00:04:42,892 --> 00:04:44,394
Let go of that connection and me.

101
00:04:45,311 --> 00:04:46,687
Over my dead body!

102
00:04:46,771 --> 00:04:50,274
If you must go,
you'll have to step over me!

103
00:04:50,358 --> 00:04:51,401
Lie down!

104
00:04:52,485 --> 00:04:54,362
What? I can't hear you!

105
00:04:54,445 --> 00:04:55,655
Quickly! There's no time!

106
00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:00,034
Then enjoy your flight!

107
00:05:00,118 --> 00:05:01,327
This way, please!

108
00:05:03,538 --> 00:05:05,873
You must come back alive!

109
00:05:16,425 --> 00:05:18,219
You have to fly safely!

110
00:05:18,761 --> 00:05:20,471
Be careful!

111
00:05:29,355 --> 00:05:31,732
EPISODE 6

112
00:05:36,237 --> 00:05:37,321
What was that?

113
00:05:38,322 --> 00:05:39,365
I'm scared.

114
00:05:40,616 --> 00:05:42,034
Am I going to die?

115
00:05:42,869 --> 00:05:45,454
I'm scared, Grandma.

116
00:06:43,512 --> 00:06:45,014
What are you doing?

117
00:06:45,097 --> 00:06:46,724
- Go away!
- It's me!

118
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:48,476
- Get off of me!
- It's me!

119
00:06:52,605 --> 00:06:53,523
Mr. Gu?

120
00:06:53,606 --> 00:06:54,440
Yes.

121
00:06:55,066 --> 00:06:56,067
It's me.

122
00:06:56,776 --> 00:06:58,361
Are you hurt? Are you okay?

123
00:07:03,407 --> 00:07:05,159
Are you a human? Not a ghost?

124
00:07:05,243 --> 00:07:06,577
Yes, it's me.

125
00:07:14,794 --> 00:07:18,339
I was so scared that I'd die here.

126
00:07:21,634 --> 00:07:23,844
- You're fine.
- Thank you.

127
00:07:23,928 --> 00:07:25,012
- It's okay.
- Thank you.

128
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,973
I'm here now.

129
00:07:30,476 --> 00:07:32,103
I thought I was going to die.

130
00:07:34,981 --> 00:07:35,940
Target rescued.

131
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:37,900
She looks fine.

132
00:07:37,984 --> 00:07:39,443
I must turn due to strong winds.

133
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,698
How did you get here?

134
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,826
- On a helicopter.
- You even borrowed a helicopter?

135
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:48,536
I had one at home.

136
00:07:49,245 --> 00:07:50,871
Why do you have a helicopter…

137
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,127
You probably do.

138
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,798
Anyway, how are we going to get back up?

139
00:08:04,176 --> 00:08:05,303
We should get back up.

140
00:08:08,723 --> 00:08:10,266
You didn't come alone, right?

141
00:08:10,349 --> 00:08:11,976
They'll throw a rope down, right?

142
00:08:15,396 --> 00:08:16,480
Wait.

143
00:08:17,273 --> 00:08:19,150
Did you come alone without a plan?

144
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:24,071
It's better than being here by yourself.

145
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:27,742
Well, I guess so.

146
00:08:27,825 --> 00:08:28,659
But still…

147
00:08:28,743 --> 00:08:30,953
When I came to my senses,
I was already in the helicopter.

148
00:08:33,331 --> 00:08:35,207
I didn't have a moment to think.

149
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:39,879
All I knew was I had to come and save you.

150
00:08:42,715 --> 00:08:43,758
Why?

151
00:08:46,469 --> 00:08:47,511
I wonder.

152
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:53,434
Why did I do that?

153
00:09:10,034 --> 00:09:11,911
So what are we going to do now?

154
00:09:16,874 --> 00:09:18,292
Don't worry.

155
00:09:18,376 --> 00:09:19,377
I'm here.

156
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,263
Hello? It's me, Gu Won.

157
00:09:34,225 --> 00:09:35,309
Help.

158
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:47,113
Why are you laughing?

159
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:50,241
No reason.

160
00:09:52,284 --> 00:09:53,285
"Help."

161
00:09:55,287 --> 00:09:57,206
They'll send a rescue team in the morning.

162
00:09:58,416 --> 00:09:59,792
So hang in there until then.

163
00:10:02,461 --> 00:10:03,587
What a relief.

164
00:10:04,463 --> 00:10:05,506
I'll protect you.

165
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:18,894
My gosh.

166
00:10:21,564 --> 00:10:22,648
What was that?

167
00:10:22,732 --> 00:10:25,067
I heard something. Something must be here.

168
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:28,237
You said you'd protect me.

169
00:10:32,241 --> 00:10:34,827
I wasn't hiding. I was guarding your back.

170
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,871
Okay? I always say this.

171
00:10:36,954 --> 00:10:41,167
Enemies always come from behind.

172
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,084
So--

173
00:10:43,461 --> 00:10:45,129
My gosh! You surprised me.

174
00:10:47,173 --> 00:10:48,174
Jeez.

175
00:10:51,844 --> 00:10:53,888
You're scared so easily.

176
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,140
No, I'm not.

177
00:11:26,381 --> 00:11:28,883
Have a hearty bite.

178
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:32,053
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

179
00:11:37,892 --> 00:11:40,520
I've never seen such a cowardly guy.

180
00:11:40,604 --> 00:11:43,940
Whether it's a ghost or a boar,
you should knock it out like a man.

181
00:11:44,524 --> 00:11:46,901
Good grief. I still remember your shriek.

182
00:11:46,985 --> 00:11:47,944
I agree.

183
00:11:48,612 --> 00:11:49,821
Wait, what?

184
00:11:49,904 --> 00:11:53,074
It wasn't a shriek. It was a battle cry.

185
00:11:53,158 --> 00:11:54,326
Like a roar.

186
00:11:54,409 --> 00:11:55,243
Bam!

187
00:11:56,244 --> 00:11:57,412
Something like that.

188
00:11:58,413 --> 00:11:59,623
So you're from King Hotel?

189
00:11:59,706 --> 00:12:02,876
Yes. I apologize for causing you trouble.

190
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,463
I heard a lady who went to look for me
hadn't returned, so I went to find you.

191
00:12:06,546 --> 00:12:08,548
Why weren't you careful in this weather?

192
00:12:08,632 --> 00:12:09,883
Are you brave or just reckless?

193
00:12:09,966 --> 00:12:10,884
She's thoughtless.

194
00:12:10,967 --> 00:12:13,053
Who cares if your company
made you do this?

195
00:12:13,136 --> 00:12:15,513
Your company means nothing
once you're dead.

196
00:12:15,597 --> 00:12:17,265
Don't put out your life for work.

197
00:12:17,349 --> 00:12:19,059
There's nothing as foolish as that.

198
00:12:19,142 --> 00:12:19,976
You're right.

199
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:23,229
I wanted to ignore the order,
but someone high up made me do it.

200
00:12:23,313 --> 00:12:25,315
Someone high up? Who?

201
00:12:26,107 --> 00:12:26,941
This man.

202
00:12:34,449 --> 00:12:36,826
This is so tasty. Thank you.

203
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:37,952
Eat up.

204
00:12:44,084 --> 00:12:45,585
You should get a checkup

205
00:12:45,669 --> 00:12:47,504
at the nearest hospital in the morning.

206
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,840
No, I have no time for that.

207
00:12:51,508 --> 00:12:53,968
I have to go to work right away
for a night shift.

208
00:12:54,511 --> 00:12:56,346
Who cares about work?

209
00:12:56,429 --> 00:12:58,181
Do as someone high up tells you.

210
00:12:59,933 --> 00:13:01,518
And in the future,

211
00:13:01,601 --> 00:13:03,770
don't put your life on the line
for the company.

212
00:13:03,853 --> 00:13:07,023
I don't want to do that either,
but it keeps happening.

213
00:13:07,107 --> 00:13:08,608
Just say no.

214
00:13:11,778 --> 00:13:15,740
There's no choice
for a mere employee like me.

215
00:13:26,292 --> 00:13:27,627
I promise.

216
00:13:30,463 --> 00:13:31,548
Something like this

217
00:13:32,841 --> 00:13:35,009
will never happen again.

218
00:14:42,577 --> 00:14:44,579
What are you doing this early?

219
00:14:45,288 --> 00:14:48,416
I wanted to sweep the yard
before he woke up.

220
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,086
Would he care that you did this for him?

221
00:14:51,169 --> 00:14:53,755
I came to give him a hand,
so I should work.

222
00:15:00,053 --> 00:15:01,304
Give it to me. I got it.

223
00:15:01,387 --> 00:15:02,722
No, I'll do it.

224
00:15:03,348 --> 00:15:05,433
- No, I'll have it.
- No, it's fine.

225
00:15:05,517 --> 00:15:07,644
You don't seem like a good sweeper.

226
00:15:07,727 --> 00:15:08,937
I got it. Give it here.

227
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,021
It's okay. Move aside.

228
00:15:10,105 --> 00:15:11,022
- Let go.
- I got this.

229
00:15:11,106 --> 00:15:12,190
- Move.
- You aren't so good.

230
00:15:12,273 --> 00:15:13,274
- Please move.
- Give it.

231
00:15:13,358 --> 00:15:14,359
Good grief!

232
00:15:14,442 --> 00:15:16,694
Why do you keep getting in my way?

233
00:15:21,533 --> 00:15:22,367
Mr. Gu.

234
00:15:23,284 --> 00:15:24,327
I've never been hit before.

235
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:25,870
Are you all right?

236
00:15:26,538 --> 00:15:27,872
- I'm fine.
- Goodness.

237
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:31,417
Give it to me.

238
00:15:31,501 --> 00:15:32,669
- I'll do it.
- No.

239
00:15:32,752 --> 00:15:34,420
- I got this.
- I'll do it.

240
00:15:34,504 --> 00:15:35,421
- Let go.
- I'm sorry.

241
00:15:35,505 --> 00:15:37,132
No, it's okay. Let go of this.

242
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,675
I'll do it.

243
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:42,137
That's not how you sweep. Look.

244
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,096
Like this.

245
00:15:44,556 --> 00:15:45,640
This.

246
00:15:46,516 --> 00:15:47,642
This.

247
00:15:48,434 --> 00:15:49,310
And this.

248
00:15:49,811 --> 00:15:51,771
- This is how it's done.
- Hold on.

249
00:15:55,316 --> 00:15:56,276
Hey.

250
00:15:56,359 --> 00:15:57,402
I…

251
00:15:58,194 --> 00:15:59,737
Are you okay?

252
00:15:59,821 --> 00:16:02,657
You hit exactly
where I got injured yesterday.

253
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,575
Wait, I…

254
00:16:04,492 --> 00:16:05,952
That stone.

255
00:16:06,035 --> 00:16:07,162
Sit down.

256
00:16:10,748 --> 00:16:13,001
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

257
00:16:15,295 --> 00:16:16,337
Could…

258
00:16:34,564 --> 00:16:36,482
It hurts more than it did yesterday.

259
00:16:37,567 --> 00:16:38,902
I'm in so much pain.

260
00:16:46,367 --> 00:16:47,785
It hurts so bad.

261
00:16:48,703 --> 00:16:49,704
It must hurt a lot.

262
00:16:50,413 --> 00:16:52,957
I'll clean up, so sit right there.

263
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:53,875
Don't move.

264
00:16:54,459 --> 00:16:55,460
I'll do everything.

265
00:16:58,671 --> 00:17:01,132
It seemed like
you didn't know how to sweep.

266
00:17:01,758 --> 00:17:04,469
I've never seen
a broom like this before, but look.

267
00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:12,810
- Right here too.
- Okay.

268
00:17:18,816 --> 00:17:20,652
- I'm good, aren't I?
- You're so good!

269
00:17:38,461 --> 00:17:41,506
These are our hotel's cake and cookies.

270
00:17:41,589 --> 00:17:43,967
I heard you like these,
so I had them made specially.

271
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,843
It's a little dirty.

272
00:17:45,927 --> 00:17:47,345
Thanks. I'll enjoy these.

273
00:17:47,971 --> 00:17:50,348
Please work with us in the future

274
00:17:50,431 --> 00:17:51,849
and send us some good ginseng.

275
00:17:51,933 --> 00:17:54,936
I only work with First Royal Hotel,

276
00:17:55,019 --> 00:17:56,896
so save yourself the trouble and go home.

277
00:17:57,605 --> 00:17:59,524
Let me know if you need any help.

278
00:17:59,607 --> 00:18:00,942
I'll help you before I go.

279
00:18:01,025 --> 00:18:03,236
We said we were fine. You don't have to.

280
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:04,195
There's no need.

281
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:06,197
Go home and look after yourself.

282
00:18:06,281 --> 00:18:07,699
Anything is fine.

283
00:18:07,782 --> 00:18:09,409
I can clean and do the laundry too.

284
00:18:09,492 --> 00:18:11,244
Did the man high up make you do this?

285
00:18:11,744 --> 00:18:13,121
I didn't, sir.

286
00:18:13,204 --> 00:18:14,497
Yes, it was you.

287
00:18:15,081 --> 00:18:16,708
There's no need, so go home.

288
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:19,252
You already swept my yard
early this morning.

289
00:18:19,335 --> 00:18:20,295
That was me.

290
00:18:22,088 --> 00:18:24,966
If you get sick of your work,
quit and come here.

291
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:28,052
You're good enough at hiking
to be a ginseng digger.

292
00:18:28,928 --> 00:18:30,096
Right, the ginseng!

293
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:31,597
One second.

294
00:18:31,681 --> 00:18:32,724
What?

295
00:18:39,731 --> 00:18:41,649
Sir, please take a look.

296
00:18:42,483 --> 00:18:44,819
I dug this up yesterday on the mountain.

297
00:18:45,486 --> 00:18:46,571
By any chance,

298
00:18:47,155 --> 00:18:48,364
is this ginseng?

299
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,535
You think anyone can dig up ginseng?

300
00:19:18,603 --> 00:19:19,937
It's not ginseng, is it?

301
00:19:20,688 --> 00:19:21,814
It must be bellflower root.

302
00:19:21,898 --> 00:19:25,234
You don't have to ask.
It's obviously bellflower root.

303
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,446
It's ginseng.

304
00:19:28,529 --> 00:19:29,906
- What?
- Really?

305
00:19:29,989 --> 00:19:31,115
Wild ginseng at that.

306
00:19:33,117 --> 00:19:34,202
This is such a rarity.

307
00:19:35,161 --> 00:19:36,287
Not anyone can dig this.

308
00:19:36,871 --> 00:19:39,415
We say it requires three generations
of good deeds to find one.

309
00:19:39,499 --> 00:19:42,043
You dug up this rare thing
even I've only found once.

310
00:19:42,543 --> 00:19:43,544
Miss.

311
00:19:43,628 --> 00:19:45,129
You must have lived a good life.

312
00:19:45,797 --> 00:19:47,965
Gosh, I kind of did.

313
00:19:52,512 --> 00:19:54,430
Do you want to come and work with me?

314
00:19:55,473 --> 00:19:56,933
Mount Jiri has approved of you.

315
00:19:58,768 --> 00:19:59,894
Sir.

316
00:20:02,021 --> 00:20:02,855
Goodness.

317
00:20:02,939 --> 00:20:04,023
I'm sorry.

318
00:20:04,107 --> 00:20:06,150
I will not allow that.

319
00:20:06,234 --> 00:20:08,736
She's a valuable member of our company.

320
00:20:09,612 --> 00:20:10,738
All of a sudden?

321
00:20:10,822 --> 00:20:13,157
She's the best talent at our hotel,

322
00:20:13,741 --> 00:20:15,993
and she secured that position
two years in a row.

323
00:20:16,702 --> 00:20:18,121
- Yes.
- Two years.

324
00:20:18,204 --> 00:20:19,122
Sure.

325
00:20:19,205 --> 00:20:20,498
Please let go of me.

326
00:20:21,582 --> 00:20:22,625
What was that?

327
00:20:23,418 --> 00:20:25,670
Thank you for saving me, sir.

328
00:20:25,753 --> 00:20:26,838
I saved you.

329
00:20:26,921 --> 00:20:27,964
You can have this.

330
00:20:28,047 --> 00:20:30,007
If you hadn't saved me last night,

331
00:20:30,091 --> 00:20:32,009
I would've died in the woods.

332
00:20:32,093 --> 00:20:33,469
No, I saved you.

333
00:20:33,553 --> 00:20:35,138
You should repay me instead.

334
00:20:35,221 --> 00:20:36,848
- I'll take it.
- Hey!

335
00:20:38,641 --> 00:20:40,268
I can't take this.

336
00:20:40,351 --> 00:20:41,769
It's too valuable.

337
00:20:41,853 --> 00:20:43,187
No, please take it.

338
00:20:43,271 --> 00:20:45,815
I can't take something
that the heavens gave you.

339
00:20:45,898 --> 00:20:47,567
You should give it to your father.

340
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,319
I don't have one.

341
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,280
Then your mother.

342
00:20:53,114 --> 00:20:54,740
I don't have a mother either.

343
00:20:54,824 --> 00:20:56,325
What? Then…

344
00:20:57,452 --> 00:20:58,911
Then what will you do with this?

345
00:20:59,495 --> 00:21:01,581
I'll give it to my grandma.
She'll be thrilled.

346
00:21:01,664 --> 00:21:04,125
Yes, give it to your grandmother.

347
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:06,961
Hold on. I'll pack it up for you.

348
00:21:16,179 --> 00:21:17,388
Something this precious

349
00:21:18,097 --> 00:21:19,765
deserves careful treatment.

350
00:21:21,267 --> 00:21:22,643
Thank you.

351
00:21:23,311 --> 00:21:25,313
So please consider our hotel too.

352
00:21:26,564 --> 00:21:29,025
I received great energy today
thanks to you.

353
00:21:29,734 --> 00:21:31,611
When I come across the best wild ginseng,

354
00:21:31,694 --> 00:21:33,279
I'll send it to King Hotel immediately.

355
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:35,615
Don't worry and go home.

356
00:21:35,698 --> 00:21:36,782
Really?

357
00:21:37,658 --> 00:21:38,534
Are you serious?

358
00:21:38,618 --> 00:21:40,620
It's a promise.
You can't change your mind.

359
00:21:40,703 --> 00:21:41,662
All right.

360
00:21:42,246 --> 00:21:44,373
If you change your mind,
join me right away.

361
00:21:44,457 --> 00:21:45,291
You are

362
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,376
a natural-born ginseng digger!

363
00:21:48,628 --> 00:21:51,589
You're right. I found ginseng!

364
00:21:51,672 --> 00:21:54,342
I found ginseng!

365
00:22:00,431 --> 00:22:01,515
<i>I'll send you ginseng</i>

366
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:03,559
as I find them in the future,

367
00:22:03,643 --> 00:22:05,478
so stop sending your employees here.

368
00:22:06,771 --> 00:22:08,189
You shouldn't do that to them.

369
00:22:08,773 --> 00:22:10,983
I used to take advantage of
those hotel employees

370
00:22:11,067 --> 00:22:13,152
whenever they came out here.

371
00:22:15,071 --> 00:22:16,822
But I came to my senses thanks to her.

372
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,577
She could've gotten into serious trouble.

373
00:22:28,584 --> 00:22:30,795
I wasn't the one who sent her…

374
00:22:31,587 --> 00:22:32,421
I did.

375
00:22:35,633 --> 00:22:37,551
Thank you for your help.

376
00:22:58,823 --> 00:22:59,865
It's fine.

377
00:23:01,575 --> 00:23:02,660
I'm fine, really.

378
00:23:03,911 --> 00:23:05,788
Just say thanks.

379
00:23:07,248 --> 00:23:08,291
Thank you, sir.

380
00:23:10,751 --> 00:23:12,086
No, not like that.

381
00:23:20,011 --> 00:23:22,305
I thank you
from the bottom of my heart, Mr. Gu.

382
00:23:25,349 --> 00:23:30,438
I mean, do you and I have to be
so formal just to say thanks?

383
00:23:32,023 --> 00:23:34,358
It'd be mutiny if I skipped the formality.

384
00:23:36,193 --> 00:23:37,236
Forget it.

385
00:23:37,903 --> 00:23:38,946
Why do I bother?

386
00:23:44,535 --> 00:23:47,538
You should've returned with the helicopter
and not stayed here.

387
00:23:47,621 --> 00:23:49,373
I had to drive five hours for you.

388
00:23:50,082 --> 00:23:51,917
- Sa-rang, are you okay?
- Yes.

389
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,170
Take this.

390
00:23:55,296 --> 00:23:56,464
I didn't ask you to come.

391
00:23:57,048 --> 00:23:58,382
You made a big scene at work

392
00:23:58,466 --> 00:24:00,301
trying to help one of your employees.

393
00:24:00,384 --> 00:24:01,761
The chairman wants to see you.

394
00:24:02,928 --> 00:24:04,305
Are you hurt?

395
00:24:04,847 --> 00:24:06,057
I'm fine.

396
00:24:07,099 --> 00:24:09,685
What about work?
Did something happen there?

397
00:24:10,811 --> 00:24:13,064
He barged into Ms. Gu's meeting
to get the helicopter--

398
00:24:14,565 --> 00:24:16,567
Hey, that's enough. Let's go.

399
00:24:17,526 --> 00:24:18,611
He had a go at her.

400
00:24:20,237 --> 00:24:22,239
- Please get in.
- Hop in.

401
00:24:24,367 --> 00:24:25,326
Let's go.

402
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,377
Hey, you can…

403
00:24:39,423 --> 00:24:40,424
Okay.

404
00:24:43,761 --> 00:24:44,637
Yes?

405
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:46,764
Back here.

406
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:51,018
Okay.

407
00:25:00,694 --> 00:25:01,904
I'll close the door, sir.

408
00:25:10,246 --> 00:25:11,831
He could've closed it himself.

409
00:25:12,373 --> 00:25:14,166
He's so high maintenance.

410
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,419
- Try to understand.
- Okay.

411
00:25:17,795 --> 00:25:18,879
I can hear you.

412
00:25:18,963 --> 00:25:20,297
I'll start driving, sir.

413
00:25:24,844 --> 00:25:26,011
Are you sure you're okay?

414
00:25:26,887 --> 00:25:28,514
I almost died.

415
00:25:29,056 --> 00:25:31,016
Exactly. I was so worried

416
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,102
that I drove over without sleeping.

417
00:25:33,185 --> 00:25:34,186
Thank you.

418
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,312
My leg was in pain,

419
00:25:35,396 --> 00:25:37,356
so I was dreading the bus ride home.

420
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,858
You're thankful, aren't you?

421
00:25:38,941 --> 00:25:41,193
Then you can treat me to a meal.

422
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:42,736
Sure.

423
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:43,779
Really?

424
00:25:44,864 --> 00:25:45,990
What should we eat?

425
00:25:46,073 --> 00:25:47,324
What do you like?

426
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:50,578
You should decide, Mr. No. It's my treat.

427
00:25:50,661 --> 00:25:51,662
"Mr. No"?

428
00:25:51,745 --> 00:25:53,622
I'm shocked at the formality.

429
00:25:53,706 --> 00:25:54,540
Call me Sang-sik.

430
00:25:54,623 --> 00:25:56,959
You did that last time.

431
00:25:57,042 --> 00:25:59,170
I'll really do that if you keep saying it.

432
00:25:59,253 --> 00:26:01,005
Of course you should.

433
00:26:02,173 --> 00:26:03,466
It was me!

434
00:26:05,426 --> 00:26:07,261
- What was?
- I saved her!

435
00:26:07,344 --> 00:26:09,513
Why should you two eat when I saved her?

436
00:26:10,347 --> 00:26:12,016
This is illogical and inconsiderate.

437
00:26:12,099 --> 00:26:13,309
What are you two doing?

438
00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:16,479
I'll stop by the service area, sir.

439
00:26:18,147 --> 00:26:20,191
- Rain check on the meal.
- Your meal is off!

440
00:26:20,691 --> 00:26:21,901
Don't eat with her!

441
00:26:27,156 --> 00:26:28,866
Sa-rang, eat up. It's my treat.

442
00:26:29,366 --> 00:26:30,367
- Thank you.
- Sure.

443
00:26:30,451 --> 00:26:33,454
The signature snack here is the sausage.

444
00:26:33,537 --> 00:26:34,413
This is mine.

445
00:26:36,123 --> 00:26:37,917
He's such an eyesore today.

446
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,960
Pick anything you like
but the sausage, sir.

447
00:26:40,544 --> 00:26:42,004
- I don't want anything.
- Why not?

448
00:26:42,087 --> 00:26:43,923
The key. I'll drive. Sit in the back.

449
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,716
I'd be grateful.

450
00:26:48,469 --> 00:26:50,304
- And pull this out.
- What?

451
00:26:59,897 --> 00:27:00,940
See?

452
00:27:01,023 --> 00:27:03,651
This is how you succeed in life.
Learn from me.

453
00:27:03,734 --> 00:27:06,529
He treats me like this
because I'm that essential.

454
00:27:07,029 --> 00:27:08,030
Right?

455
00:27:08,572 --> 00:27:09,990
You must be happy.

456
00:27:10,074 --> 00:27:11,659
Let's go quietly.

457
00:27:11,742 --> 00:27:13,577
You'll get treated as you do,

458
00:27:13,661 --> 00:27:15,496
- so just follow my example.
- Okay.

459
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,208
Mr. Gu, do you want to try one?

460
00:27:19,291 --> 00:27:20,334
Forget it.

461
00:27:21,085 --> 00:27:22,461
Try one. It's really good.

462
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,597
No, he doesn't want any.

463
00:27:33,681 --> 00:27:35,516
He'll get sick if he's forced to eat.

464
00:27:36,183 --> 00:27:37,268
I'll eat it.

465
00:27:38,143 --> 00:27:39,853
I'll put it on this stick.

466
00:27:41,105 --> 00:27:42,356
Isn't it good?

467
00:27:42,439 --> 00:27:45,317
Walnut cakes from rest stops
always taste great.

468
00:27:45,401 --> 00:27:46,610
It's delicious.

469
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:49,655
- You can have more.
- No, you go ahead.

470
00:27:50,698 --> 00:27:52,241
Walnut cakes are best with coffee.

471
00:27:55,744 --> 00:27:57,454
I need to go to the restroom.

472
00:27:58,497 --> 00:27:59,707
I think a little came out.

473
00:28:11,176 --> 00:28:13,888
He must have a bad stomachache.

474
00:28:13,971 --> 00:28:15,514
That's what he gets for binge eating.

475
00:28:15,598 --> 00:28:16,640
Will he be okay?

476
00:28:18,434 --> 00:28:19,560
No way.

477
00:28:20,144 --> 00:28:21,312
Are you worried?

478
00:28:21,395 --> 00:28:22,521
Of course I am.

479
00:28:25,274 --> 00:28:26,108
What about me?

480
00:28:27,109 --> 00:28:29,320
- Sorry?
- Why don't you worry about me?

481
00:28:29,987 --> 00:28:31,196
I'm the one who saved you,

482
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:35,117
but the ginseng, the meal, and your worry
are always for someone else.

483
00:28:38,537 --> 00:28:39,580
Well,

484
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,041
I can worry about you too.
Tell me what about.

485
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:44,168
Forget it.

486
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,843
Hey, are you okay?
Are you in a lot of pain?

487
00:28:54,219 --> 00:28:55,262
No.

488
00:28:55,804 --> 00:28:57,348
I must have a stomachache.

489
00:28:58,057 --> 00:29:00,059
Take the week off as sick leave.

490
00:29:00,142 --> 00:29:02,269
Use the corporate card
to eat, sleep, and play.

491
00:29:02,353 --> 00:29:03,646
<i>Really?</i>

492
00:29:04,271 --> 00:29:05,272
Thank you.

493
00:29:05,356 --> 00:29:07,274
Don't thank me. I'm abandoning you here.

494
00:29:07,358 --> 00:29:09,902
<i>With such terms,
feel free to abandon me at any time.</i>

495
00:29:09,985 --> 00:29:11,070
Keep abandoning me.

496
00:29:12,237 --> 00:29:13,822
Drive carefully.

497
00:29:16,241 --> 00:29:17,618
Have fun on your date.

498
00:29:18,869 --> 00:29:19,828
Hello?

499
00:29:21,413 --> 00:29:23,374
He hung up. I was talking to myself.

500
00:29:25,042 --> 00:29:26,251
I almost died.

501
00:29:37,554 --> 00:29:43,268


502
00:29:46,814 --> 00:29:47,648
Where is it?

503
00:29:48,816 --> 00:29:50,693
- Pardon?
- Your grandmother's place.

504
00:29:51,318 --> 00:29:52,653
Let's give her the ginseng.

505
00:29:53,821 --> 00:29:55,239
But the chairman called you.

506
00:29:55,823 --> 00:29:57,074
It's fine. Tell me.

507
00:29:57,157 --> 00:29:59,326
I'm okay, really. I'll go alone later.

508
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:00,452
Tell me.

509
00:30:05,582 --> 00:30:06,875
It's really okay.

510
00:30:12,756 --> 00:30:15,718
JOAS

511
00:30:17,177 --> 00:30:18,137
Miss?

512
00:30:20,806 --> 00:30:22,057
How may I help you?

513
00:30:22,141 --> 00:30:24,810
How much do you get
for selling one of these?

514
00:30:24,893 --> 00:30:27,646
- Sorry?
- Your incentives. I'm sure you get some.

515
00:30:28,689 --> 00:30:30,065
We do not get incentives.

516
00:30:30,149 --> 00:30:32,192
What an awful company.

517
00:30:32,276 --> 00:30:36,113
Our company, Joas, gives huge incentives
for the sale of even a single item.

518
00:30:36,196 --> 00:30:39,616
I'm in the diamond tier,
and I make 40 million won a month.

519
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,951
Fate must've led me to you.

520
00:30:41,035 --> 00:30:43,704
I'll let you join us under me.
What do you think?

521
00:30:43,787 --> 00:30:44,621
Excuse me, miss.

522
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,624
Please excuse me.

523
00:30:50,252 --> 00:30:51,795
How may I help you?

524
00:30:51,879 --> 00:30:52,838
I heard everything,

525
00:30:52,921 --> 00:30:53,881
so fill this out.

526
00:30:53,964 --> 00:30:55,883
It's the membership application for Joas.

527
00:30:56,717 --> 00:30:57,801
I'm sorry.

528
00:30:57,885 --> 00:31:00,679
- We aren't allowed--
- Your company doesn't give you a dime.

529
00:31:00,763 --> 00:31:02,931
You'll easily make
50 to 60 million a month with me.

530
00:31:03,015 --> 00:31:04,016
I'm sorry.

531
00:31:04,099 --> 00:31:06,143
Company policy doesn't allow me to do so.

532
00:31:06,226 --> 00:31:07,936
You don't have to do anything.
Just fill it out.

533
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,481
Your name, phone number,
and resident ID number.

534
00:31:10,564 --> 00:31:11,774
I'm sorry.

535
00:31:11,857 --> 00:31:13,901
Everything is possible in this country.

536
00:31:13,984 --> 00:31:15,903
- Where are your manners?
- What?

537
00:31:15,986 --> 00:31:17,905
She was going to join under my name.

538
00:31:17,988 --> 00:31:20,282
How dare you rain on my parade?

539
00:31:20,365 --> 00:31:21,200
Me?

540
00:31:21,283 --> 00:31:23,327
Whoever gives her
the application first wins.

541
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:24,495
Miss, fill it out.

542
00:31:24,578 --> 00:31:26,330
How dare you pull this kind of crap?

543
00:31:26,413 --> 00:31:28,791
You already stole
one of my members last time!

544
00:31:28,874 --> 00:31:30,375
- You punk!
- What's with you, old lady?

545
00:31:30,459 --> 00:31:31,585
- Please calm down.
- Old lady?

546
00:31:31,668 --> 00:31:33,295
- Yes!
- Old lady?

547
00:31:33,378 --> 00:31:34,838
I'm going to kill you.

548
00:31:34,922 --> 00:31:36,006
Come here!

549
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,299
- You!
- What's with you?

550
00:31:37,382 --> 00:31:38,801
- Sir, calm down.
- You trashy lady!

551
00:31:38,884 --> 00:31:40,761
- Trashy? You little…
- Please calm down.

552
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,813
Have you lost your mind?

553
00:31:50,896 --> 00:31:52,648
- You!
- Yes, I've lost my mind!

554
00:31:52,731 --> 00:31:55,484
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>we're experiencing turbulence.</i>

555
00:31:55,567 --> 00:31:56,944
<i>For your safety,</i>

556
00:31:57,027 --> 00:31:59,863
<i>please make sure
your seatbelt is fastened.</i>

557
00:31:59,947 --> 00:32:01,323
<i>Ladies and gentlemen…</i>

558
00:32:04,493 --> 00:32:05,744
That almost killed me.

559
00:32:08,664 --> 00:32:09,873
Have some water.

560
00:32:10,457 --> 00:32:11,500
Thanks.

561
00:32:16,213 --> 00:32:17,256
Pyeong-hwa.

562
00:32:18,006 --> 00:32:19,174
Where's your shoe?

563
00:32:24,388 --> 00:32:26,014
Let's organize the cart and go out.

564
00:32:26,598 --> 00:32:27,599
You're going back out

565
00:32:28,308 --> 00:32:29,643
without your shoe?

566
00:32:30,853 --> 00:32:31,854
Is this improper?

567
00:32:31,937 --> 00:32:33,021
Yes.

568
00:32:33,647 --> 00:32:36,066
We have time until we land,
so we have to sell more.

569
00:32:37,776 --> 00:32:39,236
Where did it go?

570
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:40,445
Looking for this?

571
00:32:51,999 --> 00:32:53,709
- Should I put it on for you?
- No.

572
00:32:54,585 --> 00:32:55,669
I can do it.

573
00:32:58,881 --> 00:32:59,965
Thanks.

574
00:33:00,048 --> 00:33:01,758
I'll look after my stuff from now on.

575
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:05,596
Even if you lose it again,
I'll find it for you.

576
00:33:26,408 --> 00:33:27,492
This is it.

577
00:33:28,202 --> 00:33:30,871
KETTLE-COOKED COW'S HEAD GUKBAP

578
00:33:30,954 --> 00:33:32,289
"Cow's head <i>gukbap</i>"?

579
00:33:32,915 --> 00:33:35,167
Is the soup made with a cow's whole head?

580
00:33:35,959 --> 00:33:38,378
No, not the head, but head meat.

581
00:33:38,462 --> 00:33:39,922
Do you want to try it?

582
00:33:40,005 --> 00:33:40,923
No, I'm fine.

583
00:33:41,506 --> 00:33:42,799
You should go inside.

584
00:33:43,383 --> 00:33:46,261
Thank you for the ride.
Please get back safely.

585
00:33:47,846 --> 00:33:48,722
I'll wait.

586
00:33:49,806 --> 00:33:52,267
No, I'll be a while. You should go.

587
00:33:52,351 --> 00:33:53,227
Goodbye.

588
00:34:01,777 --> 00:34:03,195
Right, where is that…

589
00:34:04,488 --> 00:34:06,156
Grandma, I'm here.

590
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,241
What?

591
00:34:07,324 --> 00:34:08,575
How come you're here?

592
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:09,493
What about work?

593
00:34:09,576 --> 00:34:11,995
Look, wild ginseng.
I brought this for you.

594
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,122
Sure. Put the apron on.

595
00:34:14,206 --> 00:34:16,541
This is wild ginseng I dug up myself.

596
00:34:16,625 --> 00:34:18,293
- Look.
- I get it.

597
00:34:18,377 --> 00:34:19,544
So start serving these.

598
00:34:19,628 --> 00:34:21,463
Don't forget those too. Hurry.

599
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:50,284
- A bottle of rice wine, please.
- How is it?

600
00:34:56,373 --> 00:34:57,416
- My daughter-in-law!
- Yes?

601
00:34:57,499 --> 00:34:58,709
Another bowl of rice.

602
00:35:16,935 --> 00:35:18,520
- Hey!
- My goodness!

603
00:35:21,857 --> 00:35:23,275
Who are you with?

604
00:35:23,859 --> 00:35:26,111
- Sorry?
- Who are you

605
00:35:26,194 --> 00:35:29,740
to peek at a woman
through a tiny little crack in the window?

606
00:35:29,823 --> 00:35:32,951
Peeking? I was just looking.

607
00:35:33,452 --> 00:35:34,494
Exactly.

608
00:35:34,578 --> 00:35:39,166
Why were you looking at my Sa-rang
with those leering eyes?

609
00:35:39,249 --> 00:35:40,792
Leering?

610
00:35:41,668 --> 00:35:44,546
She wouldn't come out,
so I was wondering what she was doing.

611
00:35:44,629 --> 00:35:47,174
"My Sa-rang"?
Are you Ms. Cheon's grandmother?

612
00:35:48,717 --> 00:35:50,510
Are you her colleague?

613
00:35:52,387 --> 00:35:53,430
Yes.

614
00:35:54,097 --> 00:35:56,183
You should've said so from the get-go.

615
00:35:56,266 --> 00:35:57,309
Okay.

616
00:35:58,018 --> 00:36:00,562
Pick these up and follow me.

617
00:36:02,064 --> 00:36:02,981
What do you mean?

618
00:36:18,997 --> 00:36:20,123
Sit.

619
00:36:20,207 --> 00:36:21,249
Pardon?

620
00:36:21,333 --> 00:36:22,292
Sit down.

621
00:36:28,382 --> 00:36:29,424
Take this.

622
00:36:29,966 --> 00:36:31,176
Sit down.

623
00:36:32,135 --> 00:36:33,011
Okay.

624
00:36:37,182 --> 00:36:39,101
You've peeled onions before, right?

625
00:36:39,184 --> 00:36:40,060
No.

626
00:36:40,143 --> 00:36:41,103
What?

627
00:36:41,645 --> 00:36:43,939
How dare you lie to me?

628
00:36:45,607 --> 00:36:46,858
I really haven't.

629
00:36:46,942 --> 00:36:48,693
So? You can't do this?

630
00:36:48,777 --> 00:36:51,321
- No.
- Don't be a wimp and do as I say!

631
00:36:52,572 --> 00:36:53,949
Grandma, orders are piling up.

632
00:36:54,032 --> 00:36:56,660
- Why aren't you here?
- Tell them to go if they won't wait.

633
00:36:56,743 --> 00:36:58,161
They can eat somewhere else.

634
00:36:59,996 --> 00:37:02,332
Now, look.

635
00:37:02,416 --> 00:37:05,460
Cut off this part first.

636
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,797
Then cut off the other part.

637
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,800
Once you peel off this part,

638
00:37:11,883 --> 00:37:13,343
you'll see this.

639
00:37:13,927 --> 00:37:16,138
This is your job.

640
00:37:16,805 --> 00:37:17,681
Me?

641
00:37:18,348 --> 00:37:19,182
Why?

642
00:37:19,266 --> 00:37:21,101
Just do as I say.

643
00:37:21,184 --> 00:37:22,602
You'll be blessed.

644
00:37:22,686 --> 00:37:24,604
Grandma, orders are piling up!

645
00:37:24,688 --> 00:37:27,441
- Ms. Cheon…
- Okay, I'm coming.

646
00:37:27,524 --> 00:37:28,984
Good grief, those punks.

647
00:37:29,067 --> 00:37:30,026
Peel them.

648
00:37:34,448 --> 00:37:35,532
What's with them?

649
00:37:45,625 --> 00:37:46,710
From this

650
00:37:46,793 --> 00:37:48,211
to this.

651
00:37:48,295 --> 00:37:49,421
Okay.

652
00:38:36,593 --> 00:38:37,886
Let's see.

653
00:38:40,722 --> 00:38:41,640
What?

654
00:38:41,723 --> 00:38:42,766
My goodness.

655
00:38:42,849 --> 00:38:44,976
You ruined these perfectly good onions.

656
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,937
What should I do now?

657
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,648
Did you cut these with your foot?

658
00:38:50,398 --> 00:38:51,358
Goodness.

659
00:38:51,858 --> 00:38:54,819
I'm the one who's at fault
for leaving you with this job.

660
00:38:54,903 --> 00:38:56,196
Good grief!

661
00:38:56,279 --> 00:38:59,074
I can't deal with this. Goodness.

662
00:38:59,157 --> 00:39:00,951
I can't believe it.

663
00:39:01,826 --> 00:39:03,411
Why am I in tears?

664
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,048
My gosh!

665
00:39:17,717 --> 00:39:19,010
What are you doing there?

666
00:39:21,388 --> 00:39:22,305
I mean…

667
00:39:23,265 --> 00:39:24,599
Where did you get this apron?

668
00:39:24,683 --> 00:39:25,934
Your grandmother gave it to me.

669
00:39:26,685 --> 00:39:28,270
Did you meet her?

670
00:39:28,353 --> 00:39:30,146
You shouldn't let her catch you.

671
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,147
She already did.

672
00:39:31,815 --> 00:39:34,693
And I think she got the best of me…

673
00:39:36,069 --> 00:39:37,279
- Come in.
- Yes, ma'am.

674
00:39:46,955 --> 00:39:49,457
Good work. Drink up.

675
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,586
- What's this?
- It's good for you.

676
00:39:53,128 --> 00:39:54,337
Bottoms up.

677
00:39:55,505 --> 00:39:56,590
Thank you.

678
00:40:06,683 --> 00:40:07,851
What's this?

679
00:40:08,435 --> 00:40:10,478
It's great for men.

680
00:40:10,562 --> 00:40:13,023
A mix of loach extract

681
00:40:13,106 --> 00:40:15,025
and a touch of larvae.

682
00:40:19,863 --> 00:40:20,905
Goodness.

683
00:40:20,989 --> 00:40:23,617
A man with such a weak stomach
is good for nothing.

684
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,036
He holds a very high position at work.

685
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:27,912
Why did you make him peel onions?

686
00:40:27,996 --> 00:40:30,457
High or not, they're all the same.

687
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,167
It's not like he's the chairman's son.

688
00:40:32,876 --> 00:40:35,337
Hey, you need to go get some tofu.

689
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:38,131
Okay.

690
00:40:45,305 --> 00:40:46,514
Do you feel better?

691
00:40:47,057 --> 00:40:51,102
How can people eat loach and larvae?

692
00:40:51,186 --> 00:40:53,188
I told you to go home first.

693
00:40:56,524 --> 00:40:57,776
I'm that loyal.

694
00:40:59,069 --> 00:41:01,112
Us? There's loyalty between us?

695
00:41:01,196 --> 00:41:02,197
Of course there is.

696
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,698
We both almost died together.

697
00:41:04,949 --> 00:41:06,326
Then again, I saved you.

698
00:41:09,329 --> 00:41:12,165
In that case, do you want something sweet?

699
00:41:12,248 --> 00:41:15,210
No, I hate sweets.

700
00:41:15,293 --> 00:41:16,336
Just try some.

701
00:41:16,419 --> 00:41:18,672
Try some out of loyalty.

702
00:41:41,861 --> 00:41:43,446
You're drinking more broth?

703
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:44,698
This is excellent.

704
00:41:44,781 --> 00:41:46,199
What do we owe you?

705
00:41:46,282 --> 00:41:48,660
Six fish cake sticks
and four sweet pancakes.

706
00:41:48,743 --> 00:41:50,829
They're 3,000 won and 2,000 won,
so 5,000 won.

707
00:41:50,912 --> 00:41:54,207
I had four cups of this too.
Please add that to the total.

708
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:55,792
The broth is free.

709
00:42:00,588 --> 00:42:01,631
But this is so good.

710
00:42:03,842 --> 00:42:05,135
You'll be blessed.

711
00:42:08,012 --> 00:42:09,097
My wallet.

712
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:10,473
Here.

713
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:12,767
I'll pay you back.

714
00:42:12,851 --> 00:42:15,520
It's all right.
You came to my town, so it's my treat.

715
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,191
Then may I have one more?

716
00:42:22,235 --> 00:42:24,070
- As many as you want.
- One more, please.

717
00:42:25,405 --> 00:42:26,948
Here. This is on the house.

718
00:42:29,576 --> 00:42:31,119
Then I'll take another one.

719
00:42:32,954 --> 00:42:34,456
Here. Eat up.

720
00:42:34,539 --> 00:42:36,332
KING CARP GAME

721
00:42:36,416 --> 00:42:38,501
That's still a thing?
I did it a lot as a kid.

722
00:42:40,378 --> 00:42:41,421
What is it?

723
00:42:42,213 --> 00:42:43,465
KING CARP

724
00:42:46,342 --> 00:42:48,094
And pick one.

725
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:01,524
- I got number 18.
- Did you lose again?

726
00:43:01,608 --> 00:43:03,485
You lost ten times in a row.

727
00:43:03,568 --> 00:43:04,611
That's a talent.

728
00:43:04,694 --> 00:43:06,905
Sir, are you sure I can win this game?

729
00:43:06,988 --> 00:43:08,406
Of course.

730
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:09,783
One more round.

731
00:43:10,742 --> 00:43:11,576
May I borrow 1,000 won?

732
00:43:12,494 --> 00:43:14,037
No, you need to stop.

733
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,998
I'll play one last round,
so let me borrow just 1,000 won.

734
00:43:17,707 --> 00:43:20,001
You've already said that many times.

735
00:43:20,084 --> 00:43:21,586
Look at these.

736
00:43:21,669 --> 00:43:23,087
So this is the last time.

737
00:43:23,922 --> 00:43:25,256
I'll play one more round.

738
00:43:26,549 --> 00:43:27,634
Just 1,000 won.

739
00:43:28,468 --> 00:43:30,470
This is turning into gambling.

740
00:43:30,553 --> 00:43:32,597
How is this gambling? It's a battle.

741
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,015
I'm paying for this myself.

742
00:43:34,098 --> 00:43:35,934
Well technically, it's your money.

743
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:38,561
Yes, and that's gambling.

744
00:43:38,645 --> 00:43:39,896
Anyway, a no is no.

745
00:43:39,979 --> 00:43:42,315
And I'm out of cash anyway.

746
00:43:43,983 --> 00:43:45,276
Let's take this and go.

747
00:43:54,077 --> 00:43:55,119
Just 1,000 won.

748
00:43:56,621 --> 00:43:57,580
Please?

749
00:43:57,664 --> 00:43:59,541
I'll play just one more round.

750
00:44:01,084 --> 00:44:02,085
Just 1,000 won.

751
00:44:04,754 --> 00:44:05,713
Just

752
00:44:06,506 --> 00:44:07,507
one more round.

753
00:44:11,719 --> 00:44:14,889
Are you seriously
trying to act cute right now?

754
00:44:14,973 --> 00:44:17,392
Yes, so let me borrow 1,000 won.

755
00:44:17,475 --> 00:44:19,269
You can't win this game that easily.

756
00:44:19,352 --> 00:44:22,063
I've played this a lot,
and I've never won the big prize.

757
00:44:22,146 --> 00:44:24,023
I'll show you.

758
00:44:24,107 --> 00:44:25,900
So please, just 1,000 won.

759
00:44:27,193 --> 00:44:28,611
Are you dying to play?

760
00:44:32,865 --> 00:44:34,200
Another round?

761
00:44:34,826 --> 00:44:35,702
Here.

762
00:44:36,578 --> 00:44:38,371
This is the last time.

763
00:44:38,454 --> 00:44:40,623
- You said you had no cash.
- Forget it, then.

764
00:44:47,505 --> 00:44:48,673
One more round.

765
00:44:53,303 --> 00:44:54,721
This time, you're playing too.

766
00:44:56,639 --> 00:44:57,807
Say when.

767
00:45:07,942 --> 00:45:09,068
Stop.

768
00:45:12,447 --> 00:45:13,531
Stop.

769
00:45:16,993 --> 00:45:18,077
Stop.

770
00:45:57,784 --> 00:45:58,951
Please.

771
00:46:02,455 --> 00:46:03,539
Please.

772
00:46:14,509 --> 00:46:15,426
No way.

773
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:17,136
Number 39. The king carp!

774
00:46:18,388 --> 00:46:20,890
- We drew this! The carp!
- How did you do this?

775
00:46:20,973 --> 00:46:22,892
We won! No way!

776
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:24,560
We won!

777
00:46:24,644 --> 00:46:26,604
- No way! That one!
- I can't believe it!

778
00:46:26,688 --> 00:46:28,898
- What did you do?
- This is awesome!

779
00:46:29,732 --> 00:46:31,067
Goodness, the king carp.

780
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:32,485
This is awesome.

781
00:46:33,236 --> 00:46:34,862
- I'll take that.
- Okay.

782
00:46:37,073 --> 00:46:37,990
Jeez.

783
00:46:42,328 --> 00:46:44,455
- I won.
- That was crazy.

784
00:46:48,459 --> 00:46:49,585
Goodness.

785
00:46:51,087 --> 00:46:52,296
Are you that happy?

786
00:46:53,339 --> 00:46:54,173
Yes.

787
00:46:55,049 --> 00:46:58,511
I don't think I've ever wanted anything
this badly in my life.

788
00:46:59,178 --> 00:47:00,346
Small things can give you joy.

789
00:47:01,389 --> 00:47:04,559
A small thing? This is a king carp.

790
00:47:04,642 --> 00:47:06,811
And you used 10,000 won to get it.

791
00:47:06,894 --> 00:47:08,521
Nothing's free in this world.

792
00:47:08,604 --> 00:47:11,190
I must make an investment
to win something precious.

793
00:47:13,985 --> 00:47:17,363
Anyway, I've played this a lot
since when I was a kid,

794
00:47:18,114 --> 00:47:21,743
and I've never seen anyone
who won the king carp until now.

795
00:47:22,368 --> 00:47:25,163
So you were kind of cool.

796
00:47:25,997 --> 00:47:29,167
See? This doesn't happen for just anybody.

797
00:47:29,751 --> 00:47:31,669
It's me. Because it's me.

798
00:47:31,753 --> 00:47:34,881
Only I can do something like this.

799
00:47:35,465 --> 00:47:38,301
Yes, sure. Of course.

800
00:47:38,384 --> 00:47:39,802
I'll pay you back though.

801
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:41,804
Forget it.

802
00:48:12,627 --> 00:48:13,753
Are you okay?

803
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:15,630
Are you hurt?

804
00:48:16,964 --> 00:48:18,007
What are you doing?

805
00:48:19,133 --> 00:48:20,301
I said I'd protect you.

806
00:48:36,818 --> 00:48:37,860
Rice puffs.

807
00:48:46,452 --> 00:48:48,204
- He's making rice puffs.
- Rice puffs?

808
00:48:48,704 --> 00:48:49,705
- Oh, rice puffs.
- Yes.

809
00:48:49,789 --> 00:48:51,374
It sounded like a bomb.

810
00:48:51,958 --> 00:48:52,834
I was so surprised.

811
00:49:03,636 --> 00:49:05,346
My carp.

812
00:49:06,138 --> 00:49:07,223
This is my…

813
00:49:17,984 --> 00:49:18,985
Grandma.

814
00:49:19,068 --> 00:49:20,987
It took so long for a block of tofu.

815
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:22,864
Did you make one yourself or something?

816
00:49:22,947 --> 00:49:23,990
Right, the tofu!

817
00:49:24,073 --> 00:49:25,449
- I'll go get one.
- Hey!

818
00:49:25,533 --> 00:49:27,034
You're so out of it.

819
00:49:27,118 --> 00:49:29,328
Never mind. It'll take you too long.

820
00:49:30,204 --> 00:49:31,289
Sorry.

821
00:49:31,914 --> 00:49:33,916
I was giving him
a tour of the marketplace.

822
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,587
It's such an everyday place.
There's nothing to see there.

823
00:49:39,547 --> 00:49:40,756
Please take this.

824
00:49:41,924 --> 00:49:42,884
What's this?

825
00:49:42,967 --> 00:49:45,011
It was a sudden visit,
so I came empty-handed.

826
00:49:45,678 --> 00:49:46,554
Please take this.

827
00:49:46,637 --> 00:49:49,223
Goodness. Are you made of money?

828
00:49:49,307 --> 00:49:51,726
You can't even eat this.

829
00:49:51,809 --> 00:49:54,312
When will you buy a house,
wasting all this money?

830
00:49:55,479 --> 00:49:58,357
Grandma, you don't have to worry.

831
00:49:58,441 --> 00:50:00,651
Why? Is his dad rich?

832
00:50:01,235 --> 00:50:02,278
What does he do?

833
00:50:04,155 --> 00:50:07,617
He owns a few small businesses.

834
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:11,621
You're too old
to be living off your father.

835
00:50:11,704 --> 00:50:13,915
You look perfectly fine
on the outside too.

836
00:50:15,416 --> 00:50:16,751
Do you have
a housing subscription account?

837
00:50:17,418 --> 00:50:18,419
Not yet.

838
00:50:18,502 --> 00:50:20,922
If you have money to buy flowers,

839
00:50:21,005 --> 00:50:22,632
you should open a savings account.

840
00:50:22,715 --> 00:50:25,217
No matter how rich your family is,

841
00:50:25,301 --> 00:50:27,345
you must make a living for yourself.

842
00:50:27,428 --> 00:50:28,262
Absolutely.

843
00:50:28,346 --> 00:50:29,764
Come and eat before you go.

844
00:50:34,685 --> 00:50:37,021
Does she like them?

845
00:50:40,691 --> 00:50:41,734
Goodness.

846
00:50:42,735 --> 00:50:45,863
Eat up before it gets cold.

847
00:50:49,742 --> 00:50:50,868
Thank you.

848
00:50:56,624 --> 00:50:58,918
What's wrong? You can't eat this?

849
00:51:01,003 --> 00:51:02,672
No, it's just that…

850
00:51:04,423 --> 00:51:06,175
I've never had it before.

851
00:51:06,258 --> 00:51:07,259
What?

852
00:51:08,594 --> 00:51:09,929
All right.

853
00:51:10,554 --> 00:51:12,264
Okay. Scoop some rice.

854
00:51:12,348 --> 00:51:13,391
Rice?

855
00:51:13,474 --> 00:51:16,060
Yes, dip it in the soup.

856
00:51:16,143 --> 00:51:18,688
- The soup.
- Good.

857
00:51:18,771 --> 00:51:21,357
It'll taste pretty nice
if you try it like that.

858
00:51:28,864 --> 00:51:31,993
If you really can't eat it,
I'll make something else.

859
00:51:32,076 --> 00:51:33,035
Try it.

860
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:34,495
Her <i>gukbap</i> is really good.

861
00:51:35,621 --> 00:51:36,747
Okay.

862
00:51:37,456 --> 00:51:38,624
Thank you.

863
00:51:48,801 --> 00:51:49,844
How is it?

864
00:51:55,349 --> 00:51:56,559
Good, isn't it?

865
00:51:57,852 --> 00:51:59,437
Yes, it's really good.

866
00:52:00,771 --> 00:52:02,148
See?

867
00:52:02,231 --> 00:52:05,609
I've been doing this for 30 years.

868
00:52:05,693 --> 00:52:06,736
Eat some more.

869
00:52:07,445 --> 00:52:10,948
- May I have some kimchi?
- Put this on there and keep eating.

870
00:52:11,032 --> 00:52:12,116
- Yes.
- Good.

871
00:52:18,706 --> 00:52:20,708
Thank you. So I dip the rice first.

872
00:52:20,791 --> 00:52:22,501
- You seem to love it.
- And add kimchi.

873
00:52:29,842 --> 00:52:31,552
Hey, over here.

874
00:52:31,635 --> 00:52:32,636
Here.

875
00:52:33,888 --> 00:52:36,474
I packed some <i>gukbap</i> and kimchi.

876
00:52:36,557 --> 00:52:37,641
You can take these.

877
00:52:37,725 --> 00:52:39,268
Thank you for the food.

878
00:52:39,351 --> 00:52:40,269
Sure.

879
00:52:42,104 --> 00:52:43,314
Also,

880
00:52:43,397 --> 00:52:45,649
this is your daily wage.

881
00:52:46,233 --> 00:52:47,943
It's all right. Please don't do this.

882
00:52:48,027 --> 00:52:51,113
I'm paying you minimum wage.

883
00:52:51,197 --> 00:52:53,157
Thanks for peeling the onions.

884
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:54,200
Take it.

885
00:52:54,867 --> 00:52:55,951
Take it!

886
00:52:56,619 --> 00:52:58,245
Then I'll accept it thankfully.

887
00:52:59,371 --> 00:53:01,207
- And this is yours.
- I'm fine.

888
00:53:01,290 --> 00:53:02,208
It's for the ginseng.

889
00:53:02,792 --> 00:53:04,293
My precious granddaughter

890
00:53:04,376 --> 00:53:06,295
brought me such precious wild ginseng.

891
00:53:06,378 --> 00:53:08,506
I'm such a lucky woman.

892
00:53:09,381 --> 00:53:10,800
I'll get more if it's effective.

893
00:53:11,509 --> 00:53:13,177
Don't you dare go back there.

894
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:16,555
Do you know how dangerous
the mountains are?

895
00:53:17,223 --> 00:53:21,060
What kind of a jerk made
my precious kid wander the mountains?

896
00:53:21,143 --> 00:53:22,561
Once I find them,

897
00:53:22,645 --> 00:53:24,647
I'll make sure I wring their neck.

898
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:27,983
I won't go back. Don't worry.

899
00:53:28,067 --> 00:53:29,026
Go on.

900
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:31,695
And drive safely.

901
00:53:31,779 --> 00:53:33,072
Yes, we'll get going.

902
00:53:35,866 --> 00:53:37,076
I'll be back.

903
00:53:38,285 --> 00:53:39,453
Why would you come back?

904
00:53:40,579 --> 00:53:41,622
Right.

905
00:53:41,705 --> 00:53:44,291
Come back and peel some more onions.

906
00:53:45,876 --> 00:53:46,836
Yes.

907
00:53:46,919 --> 00:53:48,337
- Go now.
- Goodbye.

908
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:49,880
- Go.
- Bye.

909
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:52,341
Go inside.

910
00:54:04,979 --> 00:54:07,314
Look at him.

911
00:54:13,279 --> 00:54:15,781
Goodness. He's very polite.

912
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,003
That punk.

913
00:54:30,212 --> 00:54:31,630
He has good manners after all.

914
00:54:52,776 --> 00:54:53,819
Thank you.

915
00:54:55,571 --> 00:54:58,782
For coming to save me
and taking me to Grandma's.

916
00:54:58,866 --> 00:55:00,284
Thank you for everything.

917
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:02,995
Now you're making sense.

918
00:55:04,371 --> 00:55:05,581
If you're thankful,

919
00:55:06,165 --> 00:55:07,416
treat me to a meal.

920
00:55:08,751 --> 00:55:09,585
I will.

921
00:55:09,668 --> 00:55:11,212
Let me know when you're free.

922
00:55:11,295 --> 00:55:12,129
Okay.

923
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:13,797
I'll let you take me.

924
00:55:14,423 --> 00:55:15,424
Take you where?

925
00:55:15,507 --> 00:55:16,800
On a date.

926
00:55:19,887 --> 00:55:21,597
A date?

927
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:22,890
You wanted to eat.

928
00:55:26,227 --> 00:55:27,811
It's a date.

929
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:10,437
Get some rest.

930
00:57:03,282 --> 00:57:04,533
What's that?

931
00:57:06,493 --> 00:57:07,661
<i>Gukbap</i>.

932
00:57:09,872 --> 00:57:10,998
Do you want some?

933
00:57:16,128 --> 00:57:17,463
This is nice.

934
00:57:18,047 --> 00:57:20,132
It's tough to find a good <i>gukbap</i> place.

935
00:57:21,050 --> 00:57:22,676
She's done this for 30 years.

936
00:57:23,844 --> 00:57:25,554
I'm craving a drink now.

937
00:57:26,263 --> 00:57:27,806
I'd like a drink.

938
00:57:29,183 --> 00:57:30,684
What should I bring?

939
00:57:30,768 --> 00:57:32,269
Whiskey, cognac, or wine?

940
00:57:33,437 --> 00:57:35,731
I just want a glass of soju.

941
00:57:35,814 --> 00:57:37,107
I'll get some right away.

942
00:57:42,237 --> 00:57:43,322
This is great.

943
00:57:55,876 --> 00:57:57,753
So you went your way with the helicopter?

944
00:57:59,755 --> 00:58:00,589
Yes.

945
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:03,092
You may be the chairman's son,

946
00:58:03,175 --> 00:58:06,261
but you shouldn't ignore procedures
with your unruly behavior.

947
00:58:07,221 --> 00:58:08,263
I'm sorry.

948
00:58:11,266 --> 00:58:12,893
Why did you take things that far?

949
00:58:15,938 --> 00:58:17,398
Because it was our employee.

950
00:58:19,358 --> 00:58:21,402
You did all that to save just one person?

951
00:58:24,405 --> 00:58:25,572
Have you…

952
00:58:28,951 --> 00:58:30,077
ever saved…

953
00:58:33,247 --> 00:58:34,456
even one person?

954
00:58:58,355 --> 00:59:01,150
The toughest thing in the world

955
00:59:02,443 --> 00:59:04,445
is saving just one person.

956
00:59:06,613 --> 00:59:09,032
You begin to wonder if it'll be worth it.

957
00:59:10,826 --> 00:59:12,369
The world has become a place

958
00:59:12,911 --> 00:59:14,955
where things are valued
more than a person's life.

959
00:59:18,333 --> 00:59:20,377
It was a tough decision to make. Good job.

960
00:59:21,003 --> 00:59:23,547
Even though it did cost us a little.

961
00:59:27,926 --> 00:59:29,845
And thanks for this <i>gukbap</i>.

962
00:59:31,764 --> 00:59:33,098
Bring it again next time.

963
00:59:34,725 --> 00:59:35,893
Let's enjoy it together.

964
01:00:19,436 --> 01:00:20,646
PUMPKIN TAFFY

965
01:01:00,602 --> 01:01:02,563
- What do you want?
- Something good.

966
01:01:03,355 --> 01:01:05,816
- Should I get juice?
- What's the sweetest?

967
01:01:05,899 --> 01:01:07,609
- What about you?
- I don't know.

968
01:01:07,693 --> 01:01:08,610
I don't want anything.

969
01:01:09,278 --> 01:01:10,779
You can order whatever you want.

970
01:01:13,073 --> 01:01:14,074
What are you getting?

971
01:01:14,992 --> 01:01:17,536
I need to report on our sales
compared to last year,

972
01:01:17,619 --> 01:01:19,329
so please put the data together, Ms. Gang.

973
01:01:20,414 --> 01:01:22,499
But the sales report is your duty.

974
01:01:22,583 --> 01:01:24,668
Why should I write it
when I'm the one reporting it?

975
01:01:25,294 --> 01:01:27,004
I have to do it tomorrow morning,

976
01:01:27,087 --> 01:01:28,297
so send it over by tonight.

977
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:31,425
I'm sorry, but I have to go home
right away because of my kid.

978
01:01:31,508 --> 01:01:32,384
Ms. Gang.

979
01:01:32,467 --> 01:01:35,429
Do you not know how to keep
your work and personal life separate?

980
01:01:36,054 --> 01:01:38,140
If you're at work, do your job.

981
01:01:38,223 --> 01:01:41,894
If you're the store manager,
you should set an example.

982
01:01:42,477 --> 01:01:44,897
Send me the report
before you go home today.

983
01:01:45,606 --> 01:01:46,440
Let me have a sip.

984
01:02:00,537 --> 01:02:01,705
This is so sweet.

985
01:02:02,289 --> 01:02:04,374
And whipped cream makes you really fat.

986
01:02:04,458 --> 01:02:06,752
How can you drink this with that tummy?

987
01:02:09,421 --> 01:02:11,089
Give me a sip.

988
01:02:20,599 --> 01:02:21,683
Why is this so cold?

989
01:02:22,351 --> 01:02:24,061
It's iced. Of course it's cold.

990
01:02:24,144 --> 01:02:26,313
But this is too cold.

991
01:02:26,396 --> 01:02:28,440
I'll order you one next time.

992
01:02:28,523 --> 01:02:30,400
You look like you could chug
a whole bowlful.

993
01:02:30,484 --> 01:02:32,027
You know I don't drink coffee.

994
01:02:32,861 --> 01:02:34,571
Anyway, I have to go out to work.

995
01:02:34,655 --> 01:02:35,656
Keep it up.

996
01:02:41,787 --> 01:02:43,121
She finished it.

997
01:02:44,873 --> 01:02:46,375
She's always the same.

998
01:02:46,959 --> 01:02:48,335
She eats as soon as she gets to work,

999
01:02:48,418 --> 01:02:50,420
steals other people's coffee,

1000
01:02:51,004 --> 01:02:52,381
then works offsite.

1001
01:02:52,464 --> 01:02:54,549
She doesn't work offsite.
She just goes home.

1002
01:02:54,633 --> 01:02:55,550
Can she do that?

1003
01:02:55,634 --> 01:02:58,261
She's the management,
whereas we're outsourced contractors.

1004
01:02:58,929 --> 01:03:00,764
There's no use in complaining.

1005
01:03:00,847 --> 01:03:01,890
Let's go.

1006
01:03:08,438 --> 01:03:10,774
MONTHLY SALES REPORT

1007
01:03:22,411 --> 01:03:24,079
- Hey honey.
- <i>Honey.</i>

1008
01:03:24,162 --> 01:03:26,665
Something came up at work,
so can you pick up Cho-rong?

1009
01:03:26,748 --> 01:03:27,624
<i>No.</i>

1010
01:03:28,208 --> 01:03:30,961
You were supposed to pick her up today.

1011
01:03:31,044 --> 01:03:32,879
I suddenly have to write up a report.

1012
01:03:32,963 --> 01:03:35,090
I'm in a meeting with a client.
I can't go.

1013
01:03:35,173 --> 01:03:36,133
Ask Mom.

1014
01:03:37,509 --> 01:03:38,427
Okay.

1015
01:03:38,927 --> 01:03:40,721
<i>Sorry. I love you.</i>

1016
01:03:49,896 --> 01:03:51,523
You have to turn the lower body.

1017
01:03:56,778 --> 01:03:58,864
We aren't taking any regular guests today.

1018
01:03:58,947 --> 01:04:00,824
- Check the list carefully.
- Yes.

1019
01:04:00,907 --> 01:04:03,827
But what's the occasion? It's so grand.

1020
01:04:03,910 --> 01:04:06,621
A birthday party for the youngest girl
of First Royal Hotel.

1021
01:04:07,289 --> 01:04:10,125
Why is she having it here
and not at her hotel?

1022
01:04:10,208 --> 01:04:11,334
Tell me about it.

1023
01:04:11,918 --> 01:04:14,212
- Anyway, don't make a mistake.
- Okay.

1024
01:04:17,674 --> 01:04:21,053
<i>Everyone, it's my birthday!</i>

1025
01:04:22,012 --> 01:04:23,472
Hi, everyone!

1026
01:04:23,555 --> 01:04:25,307
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

1027
01:04:25,390 --> 01:04:26,391
Happy birthday.

1028
01:04:33,231 --> 01:04:34,566
Happy birthday.

1029
01:04:34,649 --> 01:04:36,068
Hey!

1030
01:04:36,151 --> 01:04:37,360
Thank you.

1031
01:04:37,444 --> 01:04:39,112
You become prettier by the day.

1032
01:04:39,863 --> 01:04:42,115
You're now old enough to marry me.

1033
01:04:42,199 --> 01:04:45,077
Sorry. I have high standards.

1034
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:47,454
But still, I'll hang with you briefly.

1035
01:04:48,622 --> 01:04:50,082
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

1036
01:04:50,582 --> 01:04:51,708
What's that?

1037
01:04:52,417 --> 01:04:53,710
Varignon P2, ma'am.

1038
01:04:53,794 --> 01:04:55,378
You'll enjoy its creamy texture.

1039
01:05:01,718 --> 01:05:03,762
This is way too fancy that it's tacky.

1040
01:05:03,845 --> 01:05:06,098
She's still a kid.
She probably wants to show off.

1041
01:05:34,417 --> 01:05:35,669
Sa-rang, one sec. Sorry.

1042
01:05:35,752 --> 01:05:37,212
Please hold this. I got a call.

1043
01:05:37,295 --> 01:05:39,714
I'm sorry. You can follow him.

1044
01:05:39,798 --> 01:05:41,258
- Sorry, I have to take this.
- Sure.

1045
01:05:42,634 --> 01:05:44,177
- Hello?
- These are my friends.

1046
01:05:46,346 --> 01:05:47,764
Won!

1047
01:05:50,392 --> 01:05:53,478
Won, have you been well? Did you miss me?

1048
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:56,398
You've been well, right?

1049
01:05:56,982 --> 01:05:59,234
How can I do well without you?

1050
01:05:59,317 --> 01:06:02,904
You seem to enjoy your life,
drinking and partying every night.

1051
01:06:03,572 --> 01:06:06,116
Paparazzi are a huge problem these days.

1052
01:06:06,867 --> 01:06:07,784
Happy birthday.

1053
01:06:09,452 --> 01:06:10,704
Just words?

1054
01:06:10,787 --> 01:06:12,205
No, one moment.

1055
01:06:15,474 --> 01:06:16,391
Happy birthday.

1056
01:06:18,059 --> 01:06:19,311
Just words?

1057
01:06:19,394 --> 01:06:20,812
No, one moment.

1058
01:06:27,749 --> 01:06:28,959
Where's Mr. No?

1059
01:06:29,877 --> 01:06:31,461
He's taking a phone call.

1060
01:06:34,089 --> 01:06:35,132
Is something wrong?

1061
01:06:38,385 --> 01:06:39,344
No.

1062
01:06:40,012 --> 01:06:42,055
- Something seems wrong.
- Won.

1063
01:06:42,848 --> 01:06:44,016
What are you doing?

1064
01:06:49,188 --> 01:06:51,773
Oh my god! This is huge!

1065
01:06:51,857 --> 01:06:52,983
What is this?

1066
01:06:53,609 --> 01:06:55,152
Can I open this now?

1067
01:06:56,028 --> 01:06:57,112
Sure.

1068
01:06:57,196 --> 01:06:59,323
Give me a hand. How do I open this?

1069
01:07:02,534 --> 01:07:04,620
It's so pretty!

1070
01:07:04,703 --> 01:07:08,707
How did you know? I really wanted this!

1071
01:07:08,790 --> 01:07:10,334
You asked me for it.

1072
01:07:10,834 --> 01:07:12,377
You're so considerate.

1073
01:07:13,670 --> 01:07:15,339
This party is getting annoying.

1074
01:07:16,048 --> 01:07:18,050
- Should we leave and hang out alone?
- No.

1075
01:07:18,133 --> 01:07:19,426
Hang out with your friends.

1076
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:24,181
What are you looking at?
Concentrate on me.

1077
01:07:24,264 --> 01:07:25,599
Excuse me!

1078
01:07:26,141 --> 01:07:27,142
Yes.

1079
01:07:27,643 --> 01:07:29,394
Please keep this for me.

1080
01:07:29,978 --> 01:07:31,021
Yes, of course.

1081
01:07:31,104 --> 01:07:33,148
- It's heavy. I'll pick it up later.
- No, sir.

1082
01:07:33,232 --> 01:07:34,524
I'll do it.

1083
01:07:34,608 --> 01:07:35,859
This is my job.

1084
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:56,255
- Won.
- Yes?

1085
01:07:57,005 --> 01:07:59,174
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

1086
01:08:00,759 --> 01:08:02,886
- Is the chairman well?
- Yes.

1087
01:08:02,970 --> 01:08:05,013
- What about Hwa-ran?
- She's doing well.

1088
01:08:05,097 --> 01:08:05,973
What about you?

1089
01:08:06,056 --> 01:08:08,183
Are you receiving
business management training?

1090
01:08:08,267 --> 01:08:09,685
I'm just working.

1091
01:08:09,768 --> 01:08:12,312
You can't just work.

1092
01:08:12,396 --> 01:08:13,981
You need to be named as the heir.

1093
01:08:15,857 --> 01:08:19,111
It's impossible for me
with three brothers and two sisters.

1094
01:08:19,194 --> 01:08:21,530
So you take over King Group
and give it to me.

1095
01:08:21,613 --> 01:08:22,656
What do you mean?

1096
01:08:22,739 --> 01:08:24,616
We're going to get married anyway.

1097
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:27,661
Our dads are done talking.

1098
01:08:28,578 --> 01:08:30,414
Then our dads can get married.

1099
01:08:31,415 --> 01:08:32,833
Don't be like that.

1100
01:08:32,916 --> 01:08:33,917
Yu-ri.

1101
01:08:35,002 --> 01:08:36,420
Don't date me.

1102
01:08:36,503 --> 01:08:37,879
Date someone who likes you.

1103
01:08:39,506 --> 01:08:40,465
Sure.

1104
01:08:40,549 --> 01:08:42,009
I'll tell you when I start dating.

1105
01:08:42,092 --> 01:08:46,013
So you need to tell me first
when you begin to fool around.

1106
01:08:46,096 --> 01:08:48,098
Don't let me hear it from someone else.

1107
01:08:48,682 --> 01:08:49,725
Sa-rang.

1108
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:52,102
- Yes?
- You should go home.

1109
01:08:52,185 --> 01:08:53,812
You haven't eaten, and it's late.

1110
01:08:54,396 --> 01:08:56,565
- I'm fine.
- Thank you for your help.

1111
01:08:56,648 --> 01:08:58,358
You'll get lots of overtime pay.

1112
01:08:59,192 --> 01:09:00,569
Thank you.

1113
01:09:13,832 --> 01:09:14,708
Sa-rang.

1114
01:09:15,542 --> 01:09:16,376
Going home?

1115
01:09:17,836 --> 01:09:18,712
Yes.

1116
01:09:18,795 --> 01:09:21,006
Then will it be a date night?

1117
01:09:23,550 --> 01:09:25,093
Why would I go on a date with you?

1118
01:09:26,136 --> 01:09:27,054
Me?

1119
01:09:28,555 --> 01:09:29,973
Why are men like this?

1120
01:09:30,599 --> 01:09:34,061
Don't talk about dates
unless you really like someone!

1121
01:09:38,857 --> 01:09:41,693
I was asking if she was
going on a date with someone.

1122
01:09:44,404 --> 01:09:45,697
She got mad at me.

1123
01:09:47,699 --> 01:09:48,950
Why did she get mad?

1124
01:10:07,761 --> 01:10:08,929
Ta-da.

1125
01:10:09,012 --> 01:10:10,931
Sweets are best for the blues.

1126
01:10:11,014 --> 01:10:13,016
What? I'm not feeling blue.

1127
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:14,351
You are.

1128
01:10:14,434 --> 01:10:16,812
You look like you could cry any minute.

1129
01:10:27,406 --> 01:10:28,698
This is so good.

1130
01:10:29,616 --> 01:10:30,784
Premium cookies.

1131
01:10:30,867 --> 01:10:33,412
Everyone said they were good,
so I got some for you two.

1132
01:10:37,374 --> 01:10:38,625
It's so good.

1133
01:10:39,543 --> 01:10:41,336
Get another one on your next flight.

1134
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:43,130
- Cho-rong would love these.
- Yes.

1135
01:10:43,213 --> 01:10:44,464
I'm here.

1136
01:10:45,841 --> 01:10:47,384
What? Is this your payday?

1137
01:10:47,467 --> 01:10:49,094
Cho-rong is with my mom.

1138
01:10:49,177 --> 01:10:51,680
Everything is on me tonight.
Order whatever you want!

1139
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:06,445
What's wrong?

1140
01:11:06,528 --> 01:11:07,779
I'm just thirsty.

1141
01:11:07,863 --> 01:11:09,531
Tell us what it is.

1142
01:11:13,285 --> 01:11:14,995
It's the word "date."

1143
01:11:16,163 --> 01:11:17,831
Do men say that to just anybody?

1144
01:11:17,914 --> 01:11:19,291
A guest hit on you, right?

1145
01:11:20,459 --> 01:11:22,169
They just want to have one fun night.

1146
01:11:22,252 --> 01:11:24,421
I meet lots of men like that
on my flights.

1147
01:11:25,088 --> 01:11:27,841
And most guys who say that
usually have a girlfriend already.

1148
01:11:28,508 --> 01:11:31,761
He gave me his number
while his girlfriend went to the toilet.

1149
01:11:32,387 --> 01:11:34,264
Yes, I think he has a girl.

1150
01:11:34,347 --> 01:11:36,600
The ones who are dating
do that more often.

1151
01:11:36,683 --> 01:11:38,101
What's more depressing

1152
01:11:38,185 --> 01:11:41,771
is that all I can do on the job
is smile and ignore them.

1153
01:11:41,855 --> 01:11:44,399
If I say something,
he'll lodge a complaint against me.

1154
01:11:45,358 --> 01:11:48,278
They do as they like
because they know we can't do a thing.

1155
01:11:48,361 --> 01:11:51,406
When I smile,
they fuss about my smile being fake.

1156
01:11:51,490 --> 01:11:54,075
But if I stop,
they complain and say I look displeased.

1157
01:11:54,159 --> 01:11:56,661
Darn it. It's so easy to pick on us.

1158
01:11:57,287 --> 01:12:00,123
You're ruining my beer.
Let's stop talking about this.

1159
01:12:00,207 --> 01:12:01,208
Okay.

1160
01:12:15,347 --> 01:12:17,057
The silence makes me feel more down.

1161
01:12:21,269 --> 01:12:22,729
Let's listen to music.

1162
01:12:23,813 --> 01:12:25,690
"WA" BY LEE JUNG-HYUN

1163
01:12:55,011 --> 01:12:58,682
"WA" BY LEE JUNG-HYUN

1164
01:13:01,309 --> 01:13:04,062
<i>I didn't want to believe it</i>

1165
01:13:04,145 --> 01:13:06,731
<i>I didn't want to lose you</i>

1166
01:13:08,149 --> 01:13:11,111
<i>What if our love takes a wrong turn</i>

1167
01:13:11,194 --> 01:13:13,780
<i>And ends here?</i>

1168
01:13:15,907 --> 01:13:20,036
<i>I was heartbroken, but I must play dumb</i>

1169
01:13:22,497 --> 01:13:26,376
<i>- Because that will hurt less than goodbye
- Because that will hurt less than goodbye</i>

1170
01:13:46,229 --> 01:13:48,023
The door is open!

1171
01:13:50,150 --> 01:13:52,736
Hey, pizza! Coming!

1172
01:13:55,739 --> 01:13:57,157
Pizza.

1173
01:14:01,578 --> 01:14:03,163
Hey, it's the pork trotters!

1174
01:14:03,246 --> 01:14:04,623
Pork trotters!

1175
01:14:04,706 --> 01:14:07,208
Pork trotters.

1176
01:14:07,292 --> 01:14:08,668
- Pork trotters!
- Pork trotters!

1177
01:14:13,673 --> 01:14:15,383
Yo, chicken!

1178
01:14:15,467 --> 01:14:17,135
<i>Look at me, look closely</i>

1179
01:14:17,218 --> 01:14:18,845
<i>Don't betray my love</i>

1180
01:14:18,928 --> 01:14:20,639
<i>Come on, come to me</i>

1181
01:14:20,722 --> 01:14:22,140
<i>This is the last time</i>

1182
01:14:22,223 --> 01:14:23,725
<i>Why would you leave?</i>

1183
01:14:23,808 --> 01:14:25,352
<i>Why would you abandon me?</i>

1184
01:14:25,435 --> 01:14:27,854
<i>Stop nagging and come to me, chicken</i>

1185
01:14:27,937 --> 01:14:29,481
<i>Come</i>

1186
01:14:50,835 --> 01:14:53,838
KING THE LAND

1187
01:15:08,478 --> 01:15:15,706
Subtitle translation by: Eun-sook Yoon

1188
01:15:27,414 --> 01:15:28,957
- She's not my girlfriend.
- Then why did you hug her?

1189
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:31,292
Why did you hug her
when she's not even your girlfriend?

1190
01:15:33,795 --> 01:15:36,840
<i>You need to gain power
in order to protect your employees.</i>

1191
01:15:37,632 --> 01:15:38,466
<i>I'll do it.</i>

1192
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:41,261
I'll bring the Arab prince to our hotel.

1193
01:15:42,220 --> 01:15:43,096
<i>Welcome.</i>

1194
01:15:44,723 --> 01:15:46,558
Why don't you ever think about me?

1195
01:15:48,643 --> 01:15:50,770
<i>I never said I don't think about you.</i>

1196
01:15:52,772 --> 01:15:53,898
<i>So?</i>

1197
01:15:56,860 --> 01:15:58,903
Can you feel my sincerity?

1198
