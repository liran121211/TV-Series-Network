00:00:48,589 --> 00:00:52,036
KING THE LAND

2
00:00:52,449 --> 00:00:54,062
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:54,143 --> 00:00:55,882
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

4
00:01:34,434 --> 00:01:35,643
Are you still mad?

5
00:01:36,227 --> 00:01:38,438
I'm sorry. I won't do that again.

6
00:01:38,521 --> 00:01:39,772
Do you know what you did wrong?

7
00:01:39,856 --> 00:01:41,649
Of course I do. I'm really sorry.

8
00:01:41,733 --> 00:01:42,900
What are you sorry for?

9
00:01:42,984 --> 00:01:43,943
Everything.

10
00:01:44,027 --> 00:01:46,070
I'm sorry for all of it,
no matter what it is.

11
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:49,198
Forget it.

12
00:01:49,991 --> 00:01:51,868
You're bound to repeat the same mistakes.

13
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,828
I have zero hope in you.

14
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:55,371
No, I'll never do that again.

15
00:01:55,455 --> 00:01:56,372
I'll be good to you.

16
00:01:56,456 --> 00:01:57,999
Once my schedule slows down,

17
00:01:58,082 --> 00:02:00,543
we can go on a trip in two or three weeks.

18
00:02:00,626 --> 00:02:02,253
You wanted to go to Gangneung.

19
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,005
No, Sokcho.

20
00:02:04,088 --> 00:02:05,548
Yes, Sokcho.

21
00:02:05,631 --> 00:02:07,592
You wanted the spicy noodle soup there.

22
00:02:09,761 --> 00:02:10,887
Potato dumpling soup.

23
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:11,804
Right.

24
00:02:12,347 --> 00:02:13,848
Come with me, okay?

25
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,282
Let's go somewhere quiet.
I have something to tell you.

26
00:02:31,366 --> 00:02:33,659
- What is it?
- We'll talk when we get there.

27
00:02:34,285 --> 00:02:36,162
Can't you just tell me now?

28
00:02:36,871 --> 00:02:37,997
Why?

29
00:02:38,081 --> 00:02:39,457
I'm meeting my club members.

30
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,042
It's an important occasion.

31
00:02:48,383 --> 00:02:49,509
So you're here

32
00:02:49,592 --> 00:02:51,177
not to actually apologize to me

33
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,680
but to clear your conscience
before meeting with your friends.

34
00:02:54,764 --> 00:02:56,265
Don't say it like that.

35
00:02:56,349 --> 00:02:58,309
I had to push the time back
to wait for you.

36
00:02:58,393 --> 00:03:02,313
I tried to be understanding
since no one is perfect.

37
00:03:02,814 --> 00:03:05,024
I wanted to try my best
with the person I chose to be with.

38
00:03:05,108 --> 00:03:06,025
But…

39
00:03:07,902 --> 00:03:11,030
it's pointless to be considerate
to someone who doesn't value me.

40
00:03:13,407 --> 00:03:15,409
You don't deserve it.

41
00:03:17,328 --> 00:03:18,287
Okay.

42
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:20,957
I'll tell them I'll be late,
so let's go eat something.

43
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,542
Something simple like <i>gimbap</i>?

44
00:03:30,216 --> 00:03:31,259
Let's go.

45
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,308
What's wrong? Don't you want <i>gimbap</i>?

46
00:03:45,231 --> 00:03:46,482
It's over.

47
00:03:48,276 --> 00:03:50,361
I feel too sorry for myself
to keep seeing you.

48
00:03:51,612 --> 00:03:52,822
All of a sudden?

49
00:03:52,905 --> 00:03:54,740
When one person always humors another,

50
00:03:55,283 --> 00:03:56,784
that person gets ruined.

51
00:03:59,036 --> 00:04:00,621
I think I ruined you.

52
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:02,915
I came all the way here for you.

53
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,460
I can't believe you're this selfish.

54
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:10,590
One second.

55
00:04:13,217 --> 00:04:15,011
Hey, is everyone there?

56
00:04:15,094 --> 00:04:16,554
Go ahead and get started.

57
00:04:18,264 --> 00:04:20,433
No, I'm almost done. I'll leave soon.

58
00:04:22,602 --> 00:04:23,936
Something came up.

59
00:04:27,857 --> 00:04:29,525
I'll hang up soon. Hold on.

60
00:04:30,193 --> 00:04:32,361
Order whatever.
We're splitting the bill anyway.

61
00:04:32,945 --> 00:04:33,821
I'll call you back.

62
00:04:34,906 --> 00:04:35,740
Sa-rang!

63
00:04:37,825 --> 00:04:38,784
Sa-rang!

64
00:04:39,619 --> 00:04:40,912
Wait!

65
00:05:00,556 --> 00:05:01,557
{\an8}There's no way

66
00:05:02,975 --> 00:05:05,728
{\an8}I'm feeling jealous

67
00:05:06,312 --> 00:05:07,980
{\an8}or something like that.

68
00:05:10,107 --> 00:05:11,108
{\an8}Me?

69
00:05:14,487 --> 00:05:15,488
{\an8}Me?

70
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:19,659
{\an8}I can't believe this.

71
00:05:45,685 --> 00:05:47,687
You just littered.

72
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:48,938
Driver's license, please.

73
00:05:53,146 --> 00:05:55,148
You just littered.

74
00:05:55,231 --> 00:05:56,399
Driver's license, please.

75
00:06:03,281 --> 00:06:04,157
Here.

76
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,159
Sir, you have to pick that up.

77
00:06:22,592 --> 00:06:23,843
Please throw this out.

78
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:25,762
We don't do that.

79
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:30,433
I'm sorry.

80
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:35,605
Was that for your girlfriend?

81
00:06:36,856 --> 00:06:37,774
No.

82
00:06:37,857 --> 00:06:39,776
You got it as a gift for her,
but you threw it out.

83
00:06:39,859 --> 00:06:40,735
Something happened.

84
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:41,652
I said no.

85
00:06:41,736 --> 00:06:43,780
Your girlfriend must've had another man.

86
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:46,949
We can tell right away
when we see a situation.

87
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:48,493
This isn't the first time.

88
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:51,496
She must be pretty.

89
00:06:53,748 --> 00:06:54,582
Well,

90
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:56,042
sure.

91
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:58,628
I'd say she is

92
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,379
quite pretty.

93
00:07:00,463 --> 00:07:01,297
And smiles often.

94
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:06,594
That's a part of her job.

95
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:08,346
She's pretty and she smiles a lot?

96
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:11,766
A woman like that will
have you in her grasp before you know it.

97
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:14,018
So don't get played and snap out of it.

98
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,269
Pull yourself together.

99
00:07:15,353 --> 00:07:16,562
She's not like that!

100
00:07:16,646 --> 00:07:17,772
She already has you.

101
00:07:18,773 --> 00:07:19,899
No, forget it.

102
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:20,942
It's fine.

103
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:22,485
Here. You can just go.

104
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:23,861
What do you mean?

105
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:25,238
Just give me that ticket.

106
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:27,532
I just feel bad for you.

107
00:07:27,615 --> 00:07:30,243
You saved money today,
so buy yourself a drink and wake up.

108
00:07:30,326 --> 00:07:32,411
- Okay?
- It's not like that!

109
00:07:32,495 --> 00:07:34,997
Why are you such a softie?

110
00:07:35,081 --> 00:07:36,874
I know this because I've been there.

111
00:07:38,251 --> 00:07:39,293
Forget it.

112
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:42,255
Nothing I say will get through to you.

113
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:43,798
Just go.

114
00:07:44,382 --> 00:07:46,050
Go let her toy with you.

115
00:07:46,134 --> 00:07:47,844
You'll regret it once you're hurt.

116
00:07:47,927 --> 00:07:49,512
Then you'll remember what I said.

117
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:51,305
Go.

118
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:52,849
Man.

119
00:07:53,558 --> 00:07:54,767
Just go.

120
00:07:57,687 --> 00:07:58,646
Go!

121
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,025
Listen to what I'm about to say, my man.

122
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:05,069
How many relationships have you had?

123
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:07,446
With friends?

124
00:08:09,115 --> 00:08:09,991
With women.

125
00:08:11,534 --> 00:08:12,618
I'm a busy man.

126
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:14,162
Okay.

127
00:08:14,245 --> 00:08:15,413
Not much dating experience,

128
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:17,123
but you seem to have some money.

129
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:20,334
That makes you the perfect prey, right?

130
00:08:20,418 --> 00:08:22,170
And what drives you more insane

131
00:08:22,253 --> 00:08:24,630
is that you don't even know
how you really feel.

132
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:27,675
"Do I really like her?
Am I just curious about her?"

133
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:28,801
"Am I in love?"

134
00:08:28,885 --> 00:08:30,261
It gets so confusing!

135
00:08:31,387 --> 00:08:32,346
Right?

136
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:34,390
And how do I know?

137
00:08:39,145 --> 00:08:40,813
My woman was very pretty too.

138
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:44,358
Her face was the vision of love itself.

139
00:08:45,693 --> 00:08:47,069
- Love?
- By any chance,

140
00:08:47,904 --> 00:08:49,071
do you know that song?

141
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:53,409
<i>Your eyes, nose, lips</i>

142
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:56,412
<i>The way you caressed me</i>

143
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:59,749
<i>Even all those tiniest touches</i>

144
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,210
I can never forget her.

145
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:06,088
I thought I could die
a hundred times over for her.

146
00:09:06,172 --> 00:09:07,882
I should've held onto her.

147
00:09:09,926 --> 00:09:13,012
I should've screamed,
"I'm your man, not him!"

148
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:14,764
After that one moment of hesitation,

149
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,183
after turning away like that…

150
00:09:18,893 --> 00:09:20,978
I've been tormented ever since.

151
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:35,576
Buck up.

152
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:39,789
Jeez.

153
00:09:39,872 --> 00:09:41,958
What am I doing in front of a stranger?

154
00:09:48,965 --> 00:09:49,966
Bye!

Of course I had dinner. It's late.

What about you?

163
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:39,682
Can I come over tomorrow?

164
00:10:42,226 --> 00:10:44,020
Yes, it's my day off.

165
00:10:45,146 --> 00:10:47,064
I want to eat your food.

166
00:10:51,193 --> 00:10:53,738
Of course. Your food is the best.

167
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:56,115
Yes.

168
00:10:56,866 --> 00:10:58,743
Your food is my favorite.

169
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:02,580
Is there anything you want to eat?

Two bottles of soju, please.

175
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:15,885
Okay, coming. Two bottles of soju.

176
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:17,678
Goodness.

177
00:11:17,762 --> 00:11:20,306
They'll be even sweeter
coming from my daughter-in-law.

178
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:21,474
This is the last round.

179
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:22,933
You should go home and sleep.

180
00:11:23,017 --> 00:11:25,478
I'll sleep as long as I want
once I'm dead.

181
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:26,520
That again!

182
00:11:27,146 --> 00:11:28,189
Don't have too much.

183
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:31,567
My daughter-in-law,
some more radish kimchi.

184
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:32,902
Okay, radish kimchi!

00:11:40,785 --> 00:11:42,244
Why do you call my granddaughter

188
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:44,330
"my daughter-in-law"?

189
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:46,499
I called over my kind daughter-in-law.

190
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:48,751
What's this mean granny doing here?

191
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:49,710
Cut your crap!

192
00:11:49,794 --> 00:11:51,420
You two don't even have sons.

193
00:11:51,504 --> 00:11:53,631
Don't let me catch you

194
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:56,884
calling my granddaughter
your daughter-in-law again.

195
00:11:57,426 --> 00:11:58,469
Got it?

196
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:00,179
My daughter-in-law.

197
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:01,972
- A bottle of rice wine, please.
- Why you…

198
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:03,933
Okay, your daughter-in-law is coming!

199
00:12:05,476 --> 00:12:06,519
Goodness.

200
00:12:10,356 --> 00:12:11,273
Here.

201
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:21,575
Is something

202
00:12:22,243 --> 00:12:24,078
going on with you?

203
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:25,579
What do you mean?

204
00:12:25,663 --> 00:12:27,289
I just came to see you.

205
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,502
Your food is the best.

206
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:34,964
If you're concerned about me,
you should get married soon.

207
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:37,174
Da-eul already has a big kid.

208
00:12:37,258 --> 00:12:38,592
You always say that.

209
00:12:38,676 --> 00:12:40,469
Is that all you have to say to me?

210
00:12:40,553 --> 00:12:42,930
She got married early.
Pyeong-hwa is single too.

211
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:45,307
Don't get me started on Pyeong-hwa.

212
00:12:45,391 --> 00:12:47,101
She's impossible.

213
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:49,395
The thought of marriage
isn't entering your head

214
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:50,938
because you two stick together.

215
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:52,106
Kick her out soon.

216
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:55,276
I should leave before you nag me more.

217
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:56,277
Wait.

218
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,196
I'll pack some side dishes for you.

219
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,658
Go give some to that guy
Yu-nam or whatever.

220
00:13:03,868 --> 00:13:04,994
Don't.

221
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:05,911
Why not?

222
00:13:08,414 --> 00:13:09,540
We broke up.

223
00:13:15,296 --> 00:13:16,505
We just did.

224
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:20,885
Good.

225
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:23,012
I'm glad.

226
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:24,138
That rotten jerk.

227
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,182
It's his loss.

228
00:13:27,308 --> 00:13:28,726
You don't even know the reason.

229
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,352
I know you.

230
00:13:30,436 --> 00:13:32,897
I'm sure he's the one at fault.

231
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:35,649
Forget about money.

232
00:13:35,733 --> 00:13:38,444
You should be with a man
who's good to you.

233
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:41,030
I'm glad things ended.

234
00:13:41,614 --> 00:13:42,448
Yeah.

235
00:13:43,741 --> 00:13:44,867
Me too.

236
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,079
Also,

237
00:13:49,163 --> 00:13:52,708
when you feel upset in the future,

238
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,502
don't hold it in and just tell people.

239
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:56,921
Okay?

240
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:58,339
Throw a fit if you want to.

241
00:13:58,422 --> 00:14:01,217
If you want to be a crybaby, be one too.

242
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,636
And you can tell me everything.

243
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:05,638
Okay. I'll do that.

244
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:09,225
This is so nice.

245
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:11,894
Grandma, you're the best.

246
00:14:13,062 --> 00:14:15,814
Goodness, my dear little girl.

247
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:18,275
Great job.

248
00:14:19,235 --> 00:14:22,029
I'm glad you did that.

249
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:30,788
First Royal Hotel's LVIP Lounge
just became the top of the industry

250
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:34,375
surpassing King the Land of King Hotel!

251
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:38,128
Chairman Han, your wish finally came true.

252
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:40,881
It's been a lifelong dream of yours
to surpass King Hotel.

253
00:14:41,465 --> 00:14:43,968
It's just the lounge.
Don't make such a big fuss.

254
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,136
Do you want to make a bet?

255
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,055
It was just the lounge this time,

256
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:50,558
but will it end with just that?

257
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:53,269
You should make a bet
with your hotels at stake.

258
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:55,437
Our hotels aren't on the same level.

259
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:59,233
I hear you spent a fortune
to become number one.

260
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:00,317
Can you handle it?

261
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:02,695
It's called an investment.

262
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:05,322
My victory over King Hotel
after years of losses

263
00:15:05,406 --> 00:15:08,200
already gives me
a different outlook on business.

264
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:13,330
All right.
You can try your best to catch up.

265
00:15:13,414 --> 00:15:14,456
Okay!

266
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:28,929
What does revenue from the lounge mean
in hotel management?

267
00:15:29,013 --> 00:15:31,348
Since the clientele is mostly VIPs,

268
00:15:31,432 --> 00:15:33,183
the higher the revenue,

269
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:35,894
the more sophisticated
and classy the hotel is.

270
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:39,106
That's why competing hotels
compare the lounge revenue,

271
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:40,566
not the overall sales.

272
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:41,984
If you knew that,

273
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:44,236
why did First Royal Hotel
take first place?

274
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,489
I trusted you two
and left you to work together.

275
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:48,532
What have you done?

276
00:15:48,616 --> 00:15:50,576
They only increased
their short-term revenue

277
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:52,036
with excessive promotions…

278
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:55,581
Such complacent thoughts
are the shortcut to rock bottom.

279
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:57,249
It may be the lounge this time,

280
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,168
but that doesn't mean it'll end there.

281
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:02,588
Work together and do whatever it takes

282
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:04,381
to reclaim first place in lounge revenue.

283
00:16:04,465 --> 00:16:05,299
Yes, Dad.

284
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:07,801
The same goes for Distribution and Air.

285
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:12,598
Climb up so high that First Royal Hotel
won't even dream of competing with us.

286
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:14,266
I'll see what you two can do

287
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,310
and decide if I'll bequeath
the whole group

288
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:17,728
or split it between you two.

289
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:20,981
Understood?

290
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:22,900
Yes.

291
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:31,909
What's your plan?

292
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:35,412
He told us to join forces,

293
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:37,456
but you have no power.

294
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:39,166
Not yet.

295
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:40,542
And in the future too.

296
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,253
So don't try to meddle with anything

297
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:44,713
and sit this one out.

298
00:16:44,797 --> 00:16:46,173
I'll handle this.

299
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:48,384
So this must be how it feels.

300
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:49,301
What?

301
00:16:49,385 --> 00:16:50,469
Getting looked down on.

302
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:54,515
It's not even news.

303
00:16:56,934 --> 00:16:58,936
Did you think you were a big shot?

304
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:02,815
Someone said…

305
00:17:02,898 --> 00:17:03,982
All people are the same.

306
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:07,319
That means
everyone should be treated equally.

307
00:17:07,403 --> 00:17:09,405
…that everyone

308
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:12,616
should be treated with equal respect.

309
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,992
You're an exception.

310
00:17:14,827 --> 00:17:18,372
You're an upstart nobody.

311
00:17:21,417 --> 00:17:22,459
I know.

312
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:25,379
So don't be scared of me.

313
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:35,806
Thank you for everything.

314
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:37,641
I'll head upstairs then.

315
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:42,855
As you already know…

316
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:45,190
No.

317
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:47,901
You have no idea
what King the Land is like.

318
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:52,030
I'm sure the chairman put you there
because he doesn't know any better.

319
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:55,033
You'll get kicked out soon,
so don't try too hard.

320
00:17:56,368 --> 00:17:57,327
Okay.

321
00:17:58,203 --> 00:17:59,621
It's been a while, Su-mi.

322
00:18:00,164 --> 00:18:01,623
Hello, Ms. Jeon.

323
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:02,666
Hey.

324
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,293
Ms. Cheon Sa-rang?

325
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,003
Yes.

326
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:09,047
I'm the manager of King the Land.

327
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:10,382
I'm here to take you there.

328
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:14,261
Hello, my name is Cheon Sa-rang.

329
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:15,387
It's nice to meet you.

330
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:16,972
Nice to meet you.

331
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:18,432
Let's get along.

332
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:21,143
Ms. Jeon.

333
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:22,644
She went to a two-year college.

334
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:25,856
Okay.

335
00:18:26,732 --> 00:18:27,649
Let's go upstairs.

336
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:28,692
I'll give you a tour.

337
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:43,582
Most of our guests here are chairpersons

338
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:46,335
who are ranked within the top 30
in the business world.

339
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:50,631
One VVVIP guest often spends

340
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:53,842
more than the hotel's daily revenue.

341
00:18:54,802 --> 00:18:57,221
That's why we call this place
the hotel's first class.

342
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:01,391
It's a dream for all concierges
to work up here,

343
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:03,936
but in reality,
not everyone gets to do that.

344
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:08,982
I never imagined
that I'd get to work on this floor.

345
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:10,692
It honestly doesn't feel real.

346
00:19:13,237 --> 00:19:16,114
I'll do my best not to become
a nuisance to King the Land.

347
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:21,036
Any takes on this piece?

348
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,413
I don't know much about art,

349
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:25,040
but it looks great.

350
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:26,041
Right?

351
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,378
The chairman got this himself in New York.

352
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:31,255
He has an eye for art, doesn't he?

353
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:33,757
Yes, I think so.

354
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:36,802
He also recruited you here himself.

355
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:39,346
I'm sure he has a reason.

356
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:42,015
I trust his judgment.

357
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,688
So don't mind those
who talk behind your back.

358
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:52,067
You must respect yourself first
before others do.

359
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:57,364
Okay.

360
00:19:57,948 --> 00:19:59,533
Let's go. Your uniform is ready.

361
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:25,392
Hello, my name is Cheon Sa-rang.

362
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:42,618
Have you thought about it?

363
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,661
Yes.

364
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:47,164
All night.

365
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:48,582
And even now.

366
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:51,168
What will you do?

367
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:53,587
I should've held onto her.

368
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:56,673
I should've screamed,
"I'm your man, not him!"

369
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:00,427
I'm thinking.

370
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,887
Again?

371
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:04,139
You're still thinking?

372
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:07,184
How will that help reclaim
the first in revenue for King the Land?

373
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:09,686
What?

374
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,355
Revenue?

375
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:13,899
Do you know
how First Royal Hotel took first place?

376
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:16,777
For months, they followed
some ginseng diggers around

377
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,278
and got a hold of wild ginseng.

378
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:20,697
They sold that with wine
for 100 million won.

379
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:23,742
I'm 100% sure that's what Ms. Gu will do.

380
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:24,701
That's why

381
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:27,120
- we should do it first.
- And copy them?

382
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:29,164
No, we're only following the trend.

383
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:30,666
But money should be earned honestly.

384
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:33,835
Says who?

385
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:35,921
Who said that to you?

386
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:37,756
I doubt they were rich.

387
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:39,216
That's a classic line from the poor.

388
00:21:39,925 --> 00:21:41,551
Why are you so passionate today?

389
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:43,178
You be the head manager!

390
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:46,848
I'll end up as a nobody
if I just trust you and sit around.

391
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:48,141
You got a full-time job here.

392
00:21:48,225 --> 00:21:50,310
That's all. There's nothing after that.

393
00:21:50,394 --> 00:21:51,395
I must have sided with

394
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,397
the wrong guy.

395
00:21:54,106 --> 00:21:55,399
Go. It's not too late.

396
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:56,316
Get out of here.

397
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,819
"I'll take King Group for myself!"

398
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:01,822
Do you not have such manly ambitions?

399
00:22:02,948 --> 00:22:03,949
Why would I?

400
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:08,578
You don't want anything
and can't be bothered.

401
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:10,706
Right. You know me.

402
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:13,417
That's because you have too much,

403
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,168
for insufficiency brings desire.

404
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:18,255
You can throw out your fortune
and position to me.

405
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:20,382
I'll gladly become your trash can.

406
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:21,425
Whatever.

407
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:23,552
I'll be one for you. Here, throw them out.

408
00:22:24,136 --> 00:22:25,095
Feel free.

409
00:22:26,471 --> 00:22:27,431
Dump them here.

410
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:29,307
Among the things I have,

411
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,561
the thing I want to dump the most…

412
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:35,772
is you.

413
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:37,691
Get out of here.

414
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:38,817
I don't want to go.

415
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,444
- Not until you dump something.
- Get out.

416
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:42,070
No way. Give me something.

417
00:22:42,154 --> 00:22:43,238
Get out of…

418
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:24,321
The new staff of King the Land

419
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:25,781
is here to greet you.

420
00:23:26,782 --> 00:23:27,908
Hello.

421
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:30,702
I'm Cheon Sa-rang,
and it's my first day at King the Land.

422
00:23:30,786 --> 00:23:32,537
Our kind Ms. Sa-rang,

423
00:23:32,621 --> 00:23:34,122
you finally got here. Congrats.

424
00:23:40,712 --> 00:23:43,548
I hear King the Land
is staffed with our best employees.

425
00:23:43,632 --> 00:23:45,509
Yes, we all work there with pride.

426
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:48,011
But she's now a part of your staff?

427
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:50,055
I know her a little.

428
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:52,307
You'll need to give
extra attention and training

429
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,267
to enlighten her on the sophistication

430
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:56,853
and basic manners
befitting King the Land, Ms. Jeon.

431
00:23:57,437 --> 00:23:58,605
Yes, sir.

432
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:00,482
As per your words,

433
00:24:00,565 --> 00:24:02,818
I'll do my best to be more sophisticated

434
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:05,362
as I learn basic manners
befitting King the Land.

435
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:06,279
Yes, you will.

436
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:08,073
- You may go.
- Yes, Mr. Gu.

437
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:09,324
Excuse us.

438
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:12,702
Yearly business plan.

439
00:24:13,829 --> 00:24:15,455
Our annual revenue last year was…

440
00:24:28,343 --> 00:24:29,761
Why were you like that to her?

441
00:24:29,845 --> 00:24:30,679
What?

442
00:24:30,762 --> 00:24:32,430
As if you like our kind Ms. Sa-rang.

443
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:34,891
What is it? What's going on?

444
00:24:34,975 --> 00:24:35,934
Like a pathetic little kid.

445
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:37,477
What?

446
00:24:37,561 --> 00:24:39,145
- "Pathetic"?
- Yes.

447
00:24:39,229 --> 00:24:40,438
- "Little kid"?
- Yes.

448
00:24:41,356 --> 00:24:42,816
You like her,

449
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:43,984
but you can't tell her.

450
00:24:44,568 --> 00:24:45,986
You want to get her attention,

451
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:47,821
but you have no idea what to do.

452
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:50,490
That's why you pick on her and act rudely.

453
00:24:50,574 --> 00:24:51,741
That's what kids do.

454
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:53,034
I don't like her!

455
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:55,537
She's such a phony.

456
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,081
She's totally not my type.

457
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,959
Why did you get so angry over a joke,

458
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:02,794
as if I saw right through you?

459
00:25:03,795 --> 00:25:05,171
I'm sorry, Mr. Gu.

460
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:08,216
You have no sense of humor,
no consideration, and no popularity.

461
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,176
That's why you're not seeing anyone.

462
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,438
Hello, Ms. Jeon.

463
00:25:27,527 --> 00:25:28,486
Everyone say hello.

464
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,739
Ms. Cheon Sa-rang
will join us starting today.

465
00:25:31,489 --> 00:25:33,033
Nice to meet you.

466
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:34,659
We're all like family here,

467
00:25:34,743 --> 00:25:35,869
so you'll fit in soon.

468
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:38,788
Learn a lot from your experienced seniors,

469
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:40,790
and tell me if there's trouble.

470
00:25:40,874 --> 00:25:42,751
Yes, I'll do my best.

471
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:44,419
I'll teach her well.

472
00:25:45,003 --> 00:25:46,254
Let her sign the NDA first.

473
00:25:46,338 --> 00:25:47,631
I need to go to the office.

474
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:48,673
Goodbye.

475
00:25:57,557 --> 00:25:59,476
Ms. Jeon is nice, isn't she?

476
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,978
Yes, she seems wonderful.

477
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:02,896
You're right.

478
00:26:02,979 --> 00:26:05,523
She's kind to everyone
without any prejudice,

479
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:06,900
and she's warmhearted too.

480
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:08,777
But I'm not like her.

481
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:12,155
I believe distinctions must exist.

482
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:14,741
We all graduated
from well-known universities in Seoul.

483
00:26:14,824 --> 00:26:17,535
The fact that a two-year college graduate
like you made it here

484
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:20,413
belittles the time and effort we put in

485
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:21,498
to get to this place.

486
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:24,209
If you wish to be accepted,

487
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:26,336
you must prove you have what it takes

488
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:28,421
to be here against our tradition.

489
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:30,507
You can try hard, but it'll be tough.

490
00:26:31,174 --> 00:26:32,300
Brace yourself.

491
00:26:32,884 --> 00:26:33,718
Yes.

492
00:26:33,802 --> 00:26:35,345
I'll do my best.

493
00:26:35,428 --> 00:26:36,554
Follow me.

494
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,228
Du-ri.

495
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:45,563
Is this place for anybody now?

496
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:47,941
Hey, the chairman put her here.

497
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:49,484
I knew it.

498
00:26:50,068 --> 00:26:52,320
I know girls like her very well.

499
00:26:52,404 --> 00:26:55,073
She's the type we don't want on our turf.

500
00:26:57,075 --> 00:27:01,329
The guests we receive here
are in the top 0.0001% of the nation.

501
00:27:01,871 --> 00:27:04,833
This says you must not disclose
who you saw here

502
00:27:04,916 --> 00:27:07,252
and the conversations they had.

503
00:27:07,335 --> 00:27:09,462
If you disclose anything about this place,

504
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:12,924
you'll be held liable
and must compensate for any damages.

505
00:27:13,008 --> 00:27:13,967
Sign it.

506
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:14,884
Okay.

507
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:20,098
Are you on social media?

508
00:27:20,765 --> 00:27:22,308
- Yes.
- Delete your accounts.

509
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:25,937
It's a breach of contract
to upload any photos of this place.

510
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:28,231
Can I just not take photos while up here?

511
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:30,525
Then you can go back to your old post.

512
00:27:31,985 --> 00:27:33,111
I'll delete them.

513
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:36,489
SIGNED BY CHEON SA-RANG

514
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:49,502
KING MALL

515
00:28:10,482 --> 00:28:11,941
Is this store the top in sales?

516
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:13,359
Yes, ma'am.

517
00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:15,612
Who's in charge?

518
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:17,030
Hello.

519
00:28:17,113 --> 00:28:18,990
I'm the supervisor, Do Ra-hee.

520
00:28:19,074 --> 00:28:20,492
Which stores do you work with?

521
00:28:20,575 --> 00:28:24,079
The airports in Incheon, Gimpo, Jeju,
as well as shops downtown.

522
00:28:24,162 --> 00:28:25,371
Work here from tomorrow.

523
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:28,166
Keep this shop as our main focus

524
00:28:28,249 --> 00:28:29,626
and double the sales.

525
00:28:30,168 --> 00:28:31,044
Can you do that?

526
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,797
Yes, I can.

527
00:28:42,222 --> 00:28:45,100
Ms. Do is going to start working here?

528
00:28:45,183 --> 00:28:47,936
She's the most infamous witch
among the old witches.

529
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:49,813
What will happen to us now?

530
00:28:50,313 --> 00:28:51,523
She's that bad?

531
00:28:51,606 --> 00:28:53,399
Her name already rhymes with crazy…

532
00:28:54,692 --> 00:28:56,903
Manager Do Ra-hee.

533
00:28:56,986 --> 00:28:59,405
It's okay.
We'll do the actual work anyway.

534
00:29:00,407 --> 00:29:01,449
Let's go.

535
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:03,743
Let's go.

536
00:29:03,827 --> 00:29:04,994
- Yes.
- Exactly.

537
00:29:05,078 --> 00:29:06,704
You couldn't meet their eyes.

538
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:14,254
- Hello.
- Hello.

539
00:29:14,337 --> 00:29:17,465
Is this the team with the lowest number
for in-flight duty-free sales?

540
00:29:18,049 --> 00:29:19,926
There are three teams in the lowest rank,

541
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:21,511
and this is one of them.

542
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:23,430
Purser?

543
00:29:25,348 --> 00:29:26,266
Yes, ma'am.

544
00:29:26,975 --> 00:29:27,976
What's your plan?

545
00:29:28,643 --> 00:29:29,727
We'll do our best.

546
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:31,187
Which you haven't done so far?

547
00:29:31,271 --> 00:29:32,564
No, ma'am.

548
00:29:32,647 --> 00:29:34,399
We'll do our best to bring up the sales.

549
00:29:34,482 --> 00:29:35,483
Any specific plans?

550
00:29:37,444 --> 00:29:39,070
We'll push the sales more

551
00:29:39,154 --> 00:29:41,656
so that none of our guests

552
00:29:41,739 --> 00:29:43,366
leave the flight empty-handed.

553
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:46,870
That means you can easily
double the sales compared to now.

554
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:49,581
We'll do our best.

555
00:29:49,664 --> 00:29:50,832
Don't let me down.

556
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:54,043
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye!

557
00:30:00,592 --> 00:30:02,385
Who is she?

558
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:03,303
I've never seen--

559
00:30:04,596 --> 00:30:06,097
You must've been shocked.

560
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:08,933
- The managing director.
- That almost killed me.

561
00:30:14,063 --> 00:30:17,442
You do realize the Chinese restaurant
has the highest sales in every hotel?

562
00:30:17,525 --> 00:30:18,735
Yes, I'm aware of that.

563
00:30:18,818 --> 00:30:20,320
So what's going on here?

564
00:30:20,945 --> 00:30:22,780
I'm going to try the dishes myself,

565
00:30:22,864 --> 00:30:24,824
so change your old recipes

566
00:30:24,908 --> 00:30:26,451
and make new dishes by this week.

567
00:30:26,534 --> 00:30:28,244
By this week, ma'am?

568
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:29,204
You can't?

569
00:30:29,913 --> 00:30:31,623
No, I can do that.

570
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:42,050
- Get rid of him.
- Yes, ma'am.

571
00:30:56,689 --> 00:30:57,941
Get rid of him.

572
00:30:58,024 --> 00:30:59,317
Yes, ma'am.

573
00:31:02,904 --> 00:31:06,449
I prepared a meeting with the staff
regarding our revenue.

574
00:31:06,533 --> 00:31:08,535
Why should I go to something you prepared?

575
00:31:08,618 --> 00:31:09,827
Look at Ms. Gu.

576
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:12,914
She visited every single department
and gave them a new sales goal.

577
00:31:12,997 --> 00:31:13,873
Great.

578
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:15,708
I won't have to do a thing.

579
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:17,835
She already fired two people today.

580
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,504
"Get rid of him. And him."

581
00:31:20,296 --> 00:31:21,923
She was so scary too.

582
00:31:22,507 --> 00:31:25,093
One of them was too fat,
the other was too messy.

583
00:31:25,593 --> 00:31:26,469
The staff?

584
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:28,388
Of course. Why would she fire the board?

585
00:31:28,972 --> 00:31:31,683
What if all of the employees
of King the Land get fired?

586
00:31:31,766 --> 00:31:32,892
And most importantly,

587
00:31:33,768 --> 00:31:35,103
what if I get kicked out?

588
00:31:36,437 --> 00:31:37,355
I did nothing wrong.

589
00:31:38,231 --> 00:31:40,400
This may not be a big deal to you,

590
00:31:40,483 --> 00:31:42,819
but a mere employee like me
can get fired over this.

591
00:31:42,902 --> 00:31:44,779
You might work
at daddy's company as a hobby,

592
00:31:44,862 --> 00:31:47,156
but some people work hard
just to make ends meet.

593
00:31:48,032 --> 00:31:49,284
Does this meeting

594
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:52,245
include the staff
of King the Land as well?

595
00:31:52,328 --> 00:31:54,497
Of course. Especially if you're attending.

596
00:31:56,457 --> 00:31:57,333
Let's go.

597
00:31:58,501 --> 00:32:01,337
Mr. Gu is holding a meeting with the staff

598
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:03,172
regarding the hotel's revenue.

599
00:32:11,764 --> 00:32:13,975
A special promotional event for our VIPs

600
00:32:14,058 --> 00:32:18,813
would be the most effective way
to increase short-term revenue.

601
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:23,151
Go ahead and do that.

602
00:32:25,236 --> 00:32:26,404
If you don't like that,

603
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:31,492
we can increase the per-transaction sales
by having premium wine

604
00:32:31,576 --> 00:32:33,828
or limited-edition whiskey
as our main liquor.

605
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:34,829
Okay.

606
00:32:36,748 --> 00:32:38,708
If you don't like any of those methods,

607
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:41,669
please let me know
the direction you are looking for.

608
00:32:46,674 --> 00:32:48,134
It's not that I don't like them.

609
00:32:48,217 --> 00:32:50,845
As someone on the ground,
you must know better than me,

610
00:32:51,387 --> 00:32:53,222
so I want to follow your suggestions.

611
00:32:53,306 --> 00:32:55,433
What's the most effective method?

612
00:33:00,605 --> 00:33:03,650
To be frank, pushing incentives.

613
00:33:04,317 --> 00:33:05,526
Then let's do that.

614
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:09,322
However, providing just 30,000 won
in incentives like last time

615
00:33:09,405 --> 00:33:11,824
for selling a liquor set
worth 40 million won

616
00:33:11,908 --> 00:33:13,743
won't have a huge impact.

617
00:33:14,327 --> 00:33:15,203
What?

618
00:33:16,579 --> 00:33:18,456
You got only 30,000 won in incentives

619
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:21,542
for selling a product
worth 40 million won?

620
00:33:21,626 --> 00:33:23,127
It's my first time hearing this.

621
00:33:23,211 --> 00:33:24,212
Yes.

622
00:33:25,713 --> 00:33:27,507
Make it big enough to have an impact.

623
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:29,634
Let me know your sales goal.

624
00:33:29,717 --> 00:33:31,761
I'll look over it
and implement it right away.

625
00:33:34,347 --> 00:33:35,348
Thank you.

626
00:33:35,973 --> 00:33:36,974
We'll do our best.

627
00:33:43,231 --> 00:33:45,692
That's all for the meeting.

628
00:33:56,411 --> 00:34:00,581
PHONY CHEON

629
00:34:08,131 --> 00:34:10,466
CALL

630
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:19,642
MESSAGE

631
00:34:22,103 --> 00:34:23,688
<i>I need to talk to you after work.</i>

632
00:34:24,856 --> 00:34:25,940
Okay.

633
00:34:52,633 --> 00:34:53,843
Is she still at work?

634
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:54,886
Did she not see it?

635
00:34:54,969 --> 00:34:56,345
How could she not see it?

636
00:34:57,346 --> 00:34:58,765
Is she still working?

637
00:35:08,483 --> 00:35:09,650
Is she working overtime?

638
00:35:14,822 --> 00:35:15,907
Do I not have signal?

639
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:18,117
Seven. Eight.

640
00:35:19,076 --> 00:35:20,119
Nine.

641
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:22,163
Ten.

642
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:28,294
One, two, three…

643
00:35:37,178 --> 00:35:38,971
Just until this hourglass runs out.

644
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:56,197
It hasn't run out yet.

645
00:36:10,837 --> 00:36:14,507
PHONY CHEON

646
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,563
MISSED CALL

647
00:36:28,646 --> 00:36:32,275
Ms. Gu came by today and it was like war.

648
00:36:32,817 --> 00:36:34,527
She came by Da-eul's store as well.

649
00:36:35,778 --> 00:36:37,530
I heard she did that at the hotel too.

650
00:36:37,613 --> 00:36:38,447
No idea.

651
00:36:38,531 --> 00:36:40,032
- You don't know?
- No.

652
00:36:40,116 --> 00:36:41,909
A few of the employees were exiled.

653
00:36:42,577 --> 00:36:44,787
Why were they exiled? To where?

654
00:36:44,871 --> 00:36:46,122
How would I know?

655
00:36:46,706 --> 00:36:49,375
I hear your hotel
has a special place for the exiles.

656
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:51,752
I don't know.

657
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:07,935
Who is it?

658
00:37:08,895 --> 00:37:09,896
I don't know.

659
00:37:12,023 --> 00:37:13,149
Well,

660
00:37:13,232 --> 00:37:15,192
I don't need to know their place of exile

661
00:37:15,693 --> 00:37:17,069
when I'm about to get axed.

662
00:37:17,695 --> 00:37:18,905
Why? Did you do something wrong?

663
00:37:18,988 --> 00:37:20,406
She wants us to double the sales.

664
00:37:21,032 --> 00:37:22,700
If we make low in-flight sales,

665
00:37:22,783 --> 00:37:24,035
we'll become traitors.

666
00:37:24,994 --> 00:37:26,120
How can you double them?

667
00:37:26,203 --> 00:37:29,582
If they keep pestering the staff,
we'll somehow bring in sales,

668
00:37:29,665 --> 00:37:32,585
so they'll pester us
until the point of death.

669
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:34,754
Didn't they discuss sales with you?

670
00:37:34,837 --> 00:37:36,589
We get incentives for pushing sales.

671
00:37:37,298 --> 00:37:38,341
Really?

672
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:40,885
Your team is the best off.

673
00:37:41,844 --> 00:37:43,054
How much?

674
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:44,847
No idea.

675
00:37:44,931 --> 00:37:47,391
It's not like the incentives
or the lack thereof

676
00:37:47,475 --> 00:37:49,226
will make me work more or less.

677
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:51,520
I'm just going to do my job.

678
00:37:52,396 --> 00:37:55,441
But I'm not getting anywhere
although I'm doing more than my job.

679
00:37:55,524 --> 00:37:57,443
I'm suffocated in the middle,

680
00:37:57,526 --> 00:37:59,362
pushed around by my seniors and juniors.

681
00:38:01,197 --> 00:38:03,324
If you need help, ask Da-eul for a lesson.

682
00:38:03,908 --> 00:38:05,159
Her shop had the top sales.

683
00:38:05,242 --> 00:38:06,577
I really should.

684
00:38:08,955 --> 00:38:10,748
Good for Da-eul.

685
00:38:10,831 --> 00:38:13,042
She's the manager,
the best salesperson, married,

686
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:14,669
and has an adorable daughter.

687
00:38:14,752 --> 00:38:15,711
She has it all.

688
00:38:16,629 --> 00:38:17,713
I'm jealous!

689
00:38:18,255 --> 00:38:19,340
I'm jealous!

690
00:38:23,344 --> 00:38:24,762
I'm home.

691
00:38:24,845 --> 00:38:26,389
- Mom's here.
- Hey, Cho-rong.

692
00:38:27,181 --> 00:38:28,349
What did you draw?

693
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:29,892
You're home.

694
00:38:29,976 --> 00:38:31,852
Make dinner. I'm hungry.

695
00:38:32,478 --> 00:38:33,562
Okay.

696
00:38:34,689 --> 00:38:35,982
Look at that.

697
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,361
What's with them?

698
00:38:55,626 --> 00:38:58,504
Mother, I need to go grocery shopping.

699
00:38:58,587 --> 00:38:59,630
There's no food.

700
00:38:59,714 --> 00:39:01,674
Why didn't you go beforehand?

701
00:39:01,757 --> 00:39:04,010
It'll take forever for us to eat.

702
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:08,639
I made braised short ribs
and pollack soup this morning,

703
00:39:08,723 --> 00:39:10,641
but a thief must've come and eaten it all.

704
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,854
That's why you should make
more than enough when you cook.

705
00:39:15,438 --> 00:39:17,231
Don't be so stingy with food.

706
00:39:17,815 --> 00:39:18,649
Grandma.

707
00:39:18,733 --> 00:39:20,317
Don't be mean to Mom.

708
00:39:20,401 --> 00:39:24,363
Aunt, Uncle, and that darned family
came and finished everything.

709
00:39:25,114 --> 00:39:27,908
Who taught you such a phrase?

710
00:39:27,992 --> 00:39:29,076
Don't use such words.

711
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,578
While you're at it,

712
00:39:30,661 --> 00:39:32,955
get some oxtail and make a hearty broth.

713
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:35,583
I must be low on energy.

714
00:39:35,666 --> 00:39:37,334
- I haven't had an appetite.
- Jeez.

715
00:39:37,418 --> 00:39:39,962
You cleared three bowls of rice
without an appetite?

716
00:39:40,713 --> 00:39:43,299
I only had three bowls
because I had no appetite.

717
00:39:45,468 --> 00:39:46,844
What are you waiting for?

718
00:39:46,927 --> 00:39:48,179
Go get the groceries.

719
00:39:49,221 --> 00:39:50,931
Okay, I'll be back soon.

720
00:39:51,015 --> 00:39:52,600
Cho-rong, come with Mom.

721
00:39:55,978 --> 00:39:57,313
Look at that.

722
00:40:00,691 --> 00:40:02,943
Mom, our home isn't a restaurant.

723
00:40:03,944 --> 00:40:06,614
Why does Aunt always come
and eat at our place?

724
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:09,450
I guess my food is much better.

725
00:40:10,326 --> 00:40:12,286
She always comes and eats for free,

726
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:13,621
never even does the dishes,

727
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:16,373
and steals everything good
from our fridge.

728
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:19,335
Should we report her to the police?

729
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:22,463
Let's say it's because I'm a good cook
and give her a break.

730
00:40:26,884 --> 00:40:28,469
Cho-rong, do you want a doll?

731
00:40:37,895 --> 00:40:40,022
Hello? Where are you?

732
00:40:40,564 --> 00:40:42,399
Can you come to the grocery store?

733
00:40:42,483 --> 00:40:43,609
I have too much stuff.

734
00:40:43,692 --> 00:40:46,695
<i>Sorry, I'm out having dinner
with a client.</i>

735
00:40:46,779 --> 00:40:48,906
Still? Can't you sneak out?

736
00:40:48,989 --> 00:40:50,241
How can I do that?

737
00:40:50,324 --> 00:40:51,242
It's a part of work.

738
00:40:52,243 --> 00:40:54,537
Okay. Make sure you eat well.

739
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,497
- Don't strain yourself.
<i>- Okay.</i>

740
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,498
You too.

741
00:40:57,581 --> 00:40:59,500
Don't strain yourself and get a good rest.

742
00:41:00,084 --> 00:41:02,628
I'll be late tonight,
so you should go to sleep first.

743
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:05,464
Bye.

744
00:41:33,701 --> 00:41:34,702
I need to talk to you.

745
00:41:44,556 --> 00:41:46,099
Would you like to order?

746
00:41:48,977 --> 00:41:50,229
I asked to see you yesterday.

747
00:41:50,312 --> 00:41:51,897
What? When?

748
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:52,981
Didn't you see the text?

749
00:41:53,565 --> 00:41:54,816
I called you too.

750
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,818
- Do you know my number?
- Of course.

751
00:41:56,902 --> 00:41:58,320
It's in your personnel record.

752
00:41:58,987 --> 00:42:00,239
Don't you know mine, Phony Cheon?

753
00:42:00,322 --> 00:42:02,324
I have no access to your personnel record.

754
00:42:08,747 --> 00:42:09,831
Here.

755
00:42:09,915 --> 00:42:11,750
That's my number. Save it.

756
00:42:13,543 --> 00:42:15,921
So what did you want to say to me?

757
00:42:18,423 --> 00:42:19,466
I must

758
00:42:20,175 --> 00:42:21,385
ask you something.

759
00:42:22,177 --> 00:42:23,053
Ask away.

760
00:42:23,929 --> 00:42:26,139
Let's talk over dinner after work.

761
00:42:26,223 --> 00:42:27,474
Wait.

762
00:42:27,557 --> 00:42:29,309
Can't you just tell me now?

763
00:42:30,894 --> 00:42:33,313
You treated me to juice
on Gapado last time.

764
00:42:34,022 --> 00:42:36,149
I'd like to return the favor,
so I'll see you then.

765
00:42:36,233 --> 00:42:37,317
No, it's okay.

766
00:42:37,943 --> 00:42:39,152
I'm not okay.

767
00:42:39,695 --> 00:42:42,072
I simply can't stand
owing someone a favor.

768
00:42:42,155 --> 00:42:43,699
But I'm okay with it.

769
00:42:50,163 --> 00:42:51,248
Is it too much

770
00:42:52,332 --> 00:42:53,292
for you

771
00:42:53,375 --> 00:42:56,086
to just say yes this once?

772
00:42:57,879 --> 00:42:59,047
Well,

773
00:42:59,131 --> 00:43:00,716
isn't it proper manners to check

774
00:43:00,799 --> 00:43:03,302
if I have a prior engagement
before asking me to dinner?

775
00:43:12,352 --> 00:43:13,312
Ms. Phony Cheon.

776
00:43:14,104 --> 00:43:14,980
Do you have

777
00:43:15,063 --> 00:43:17,399
plans for dinner

778
00:43:19,234 --> 00:43:20,444
tonight?

779
00:43:21,028 --> 00:43:22,237
No, I don't.

780
00:43:23,155 --> 00:43:24,072
In that case,

781
00:43:25,657 --> 00:43:27,367
would you like

782
00:43:29,077 --> 00:43:30,203
to have dinner

783
00:43:30,787 --> 00:43:31,747
with me?

784
00:43:32,497 --> 00:43:33,582
I don't want to.

785
00:43:33,665 --> 00:43:35,375
Why not? Why do you say no to me?

786
00:43:35,459 --> 00:43:37,794
I didn't say no to you.

787
00:43:37,878 --> 00:43:39,004
I said no to dinner.

788
00:43:40,756 --> 00:43:43,467
Then Ms. Phony Cheon,
what do you like other than dinner?

789
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:45,927
It's just that it'd be so awkward
to eat alone with you.

790
00:43:48,388 --> 00:43:49,598
So you won't order?

791
00:43:50,682 --> 00:43:51,725
I won't.

792
00:43:53,477 --> 00:43:54,644
I'm not eating!

793
00:44:11,036 --> 00:44:11,995
What's with him?

794
00:44:15,916 --> 00:44:16,958
Next.

795
00:44:23,507 --> 00:44:24,466
And next.

796
00:44:29,971 --> 00:44:30,931
Next.

797
00:44:32,682 --> 00:44:34,559
{\an8}You must choose a photo today.

798
00:44:34,643 --> 00:44:36,603
They all look the same to me.

799
00:44:36,686 --> 00:44:38,480
So much so that it's almost scary.

800
00:44:39,231 --> 00:44:40,607
Please make your call.

801
00:44:41,191 --> 00:44:42,067
I've decided.

802
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:44,277
Thank you. Which one?

803
00:44:44,361 --> 00:44:47,155
I simply must have
dinner with her tonight.

804
00:44:47,948 --> 00:44:50,283
Make dinner plans
with Ms. Cheon Sa-rang after work.

805
00:44:51,743 --> 00:44:52,702
Make sure she comes.

806
00:44:53,286 --> 00:44:54,913
Why? Is something going on?

807
00:44:56,373 --> 00:44:58,166
- Tell her it's a welcome dinner.
- A welcome dinner?

808
00:44:59,292 --> 00:45:00,627
Where at?

809
00:45:07,175 --> 00:45:08,093
The hotel's

810
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:10,053
Japanese restaurant.

811
00:45:10,137 --> 00:45:11,304
After the welcome dinner,

812
00:45:11,388 --> 00:45:13,598
you must choose a photo, okay?

813
00:45:13,682 --> 00:45:15,767
You have to. Please?

814
00:45:24,359 --> 00:45:26,736
Hello, it's been a while.

815
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:28,697
A strong cup of coffee, please.

816
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:30,490
I'll bring it to the cockpit.

817
00:45:30,574 --> 00:45:32,993
No, I'd like to have it here with you

818
00:45:33,076 --> 00:45:34,744
in this cozy galley.

819
00:45:34,828 --> 00:45:36,288
I'll bring it to you.

820
00:45:37,956 --> 00:45:39,374
You're still as feisty as ever.

821
00:45:40,959 --> 00:45:43,628
Eat dinner with me after the flight.
It's been a while.

822
00:45:43,712 --> 00:45:44,754
No.

823
00:45:45,422 --> 00:45:47,048
Here's your cozy cup of coffee.

824
00:45:48,008 --> 00:45:49,634
Please excuse me.

825
00:45:52,971 --> 00:45:54,222
Don't be so cheeky.

826
00:45:54,973 --> 00:45:58,143
Who do you think will suffer
if I start acting nasty?

827
00:46:00,478 --> 00:46:02,189
Do you still think I'm a joke?

828
00:46:02,856 --> 00:46:03,899
No.

829
00:46:04,691 --> 00:46:06,067
I still want you.

830
00:46:15,744 --> 00:46:16,745
Hello.

831
00:46:16,828 --> 00:46:18,413
Would you like something?

832
00:46:18,496 --> 00:46:19,748
What? No.

833
00:46:19,831 --> 00:46:21,041
I already got it.

834
00:46:21,833 --> 00:46:23,084
Keep it up.

835
00:46:35,305 --> 00:46:36,681
Did something happen?

836
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:38,475
It's not a big deal.

837
00:46:40,769 --> 00:46:42,437
Do you have plans tonight?

838
00:46:42,938 --> 00:46:44,231
I'm just going to rest.

839
00:46:44,898 --> 00:46:47,067
How about having a beer with me?

840
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:49,110
No, I'm tired. I'm not in the mood.

841
00:46:49,194 --> 00:46:52,906
My mom told me to treat you
and thank you for her scarf.

842
00:46:52,989 --> 00:46:54,991
It's okay. I wanted to thank you first.

843
00:46:55,075 --> 00:46:56,701
Well, I'm using her as an excuse.

844
00:46:57,369 --> 00:46:59,329
I want to have dinner with you.

845
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:07,420
Let's get dinner together.

846
00:47:17,222 --> 00:47:18,265
This is nice.

847
00:47:19,182 --> 00:47:20,392
I think so too.

848
00:47:21,893 --> 00:47:23,144
Don't you love it here?

849
00:47:23,979 --> 00:47:25,689
The waves and the wind.

850
00:47:27,691 --> 00:47:31,278
I love seeing you so happy.

851
00:47:42,247 --> 00:47:44,749
Thank you for your help last time.

852
00:47:47,836 --> 00:47:49,421
How could I not act

853
00:47:49,504 --> 00:47:52,299
after seeing my senior
run for her life like that?

854
00:47:52,382 --> 00:47:55,302
I was just doing you a favor
to make my life easier at work.

855
00:47:55,385 --> 00:47:56,678
You don't have to thank me.

856
00:47:59,556 --> 00:48:01,683
If that's the reason, I'm sorry.

857
00:48:01,766 --> 00:48:02,976
Why?

858
00:48:03,059 --> 00:48:04,561
You picked the wrong senior.

859
00:48:05,312 --> 00:48:07,897
I'm the only one among my peers
who didn't make assistant purser.

860
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:10,525
If I don't get promoted next year,

861
00:48:10,608 --> 00:48:12,569
people will know that I've been left out.

862
00:48:13,528 --> 00:48:14,696
That'll be the end of me.

863
00:48:16,698 --> 00:48:18,033
What about it?

864
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:20,493
What do you mean?

865
00:48:20,577 --> 00:48:23,079
You won't benefit in any way
if you befriend me.

866
00:48:23,747 --> 00:48:24,706
So stay away.

867
00:48:27,709 --> 00:48:29,294
So what if I can't get promoted?

868
00:48:30,211 --> 00:48:33,006
It hurts too much to fall from high-up.

869
00:48:33,715 --> 00:48:35,759
I prefer the low and long haul.

870
00:48:36,426 --> 00:48:37,510
Sounds great.

871
00:48:37,594 --> 00:48:40,388
I'll have to be
one of your close associates.

872
00:48:42,932 --> 00:48:44,517
You'll regret it later.

873
00:48:46,186 --> 00:48:47,520
I never will.

874
00:48:59,282 --> 00:49:00,367
What do you think about Mi-na?

875
00:49:01,159 --> 00:49:02,285
She's a great girl.

876
00:49:02,869 --> 00:49:05,330
She's very curious about you.

877
00:49:05,413 --> 00:49:07,123
What about you?

878
00:49:08,625 --> 00:49:09,542
What?

879
00:49:09,626 --> 00:49:11,419
I'm very curious about you.

880
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:28,436
This way, please.

881
00:49:51,876 --> 00:49:54,045
- Hello, Mr. Gu.
- Hello, Mr. Gu.

882
00:49:56,047 --> 00:49:57,465
- Why?
- What is this?

883
00:49:57,549 --> 00:49:58,383
A welcome dinner.

884
00:49:58,925 --> 00:50:00,427
- Why?
- To welcome Ms. Cheon.

885
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:02,429
You told me to put a dinner together.

886
00:50:02,512 --> 00:50:04,305
Is this really…

887
00:50:04,389 --> 00:50:05,348
You're…

888
00:50:07,308 --> 00:50:09,519
- They can eat and go.
- Don't be so shy.

889
00:50:09,602 --> 00:50:10,854
Please go inside.

890
00:50:13,773 --> 00:50:15,817
- Hello, Mr. Gu.
- Hello, Mr. Gu.

891
00:50:25,994 --> 00:50:29,289
Let's take a group photo before we eat.

892
00:50:29,873 --> 00:50:31,708
Okay, Hermès.

893
00:50:31,791 --> 00:50:33,042
One, two, three.

894
00:50:34,836 --> 00:50:36,004
Thank you.

895
00:50:36,588 --> 00:50:38,256
Look at that. You look great.

896
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:44,012
Cheers. Congrats.

897
00:50:44,762 --> 00:50:45,680
Thank you.

898
00:50:46,306 --> 00:50:47,223
Mr. Gu.

899
00:50:47,307 --> 00:50:50,268
Thank you for sparing your time
for our rookie, sir.

900
00:50:51,436 --> 00:50:52,353
Please eat.

901
00:50:52,937 --> 00:50:54,481
- Maybe a toast?
- Let's just eat.

902
00:50:55,982 --> 00:50:56,941
Thank you.

903
00:50:57,525 --> 00:50:58,818
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

904
00:51:23,259 --> 00:51:24,344
Ms. Cheon.

905
00:51:24,427 --> 00:51:25,512
Is it not to your liking?

906
00:51:27,096 --> 00:51:28,640
No, it's good.

907
00:51:28,723 --> 00:51:30,475
How would you know without having any?

908
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:32,435
Do you not eat raw fish?

909
00:51:33,353 --> 00:51:34,312
I'm fine.

910
00:51:34,395 --> 00:51:37,065
Mr. No, prepare a steak for her.

911
00:51:38,274 --> 00:51:39,317
It's a Japanese restaurant.

912
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,777
I know. I meant next door.

913
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:42,820
No, I'm fine, really.

914
00:51:42,904 --> 00:51:45,698
Let me know
if any of you can't eat raw fish.

915
00:51:45,782 --> 00:51:47,992
I'm fine. I'm not picky.

916
00:51:48,076 --> 00:51:50,286
Me too. I like raw fish.

917
00:51:51,996 --> 00:51:54,040
- Should I go?
- I'll be right back.

918
00:51:58,545 --> 00:52:00,755
I thought that was the door.

919
00:52:08,596 --> 00:52:11,641
I'm Edward Jung, the head chef
of King Hotel's Western restaurant.

920
00:52:11,724 --> 00:52:13,643
This is an Angus sirloin steak,

921
00:52:13,726 --> 00:52:15,395
a prime T-bone steak,

922
00:52:15,478 --> 00:52:17,564
and an Australian lamb chop steak.

923
00:52:17,647 --> 00:52:18,606
Have a lovely dinner.

924
00:52:19,524 --> 00:52:20,900
Thank you.

925
00:52:30,201 --> 00:52:31,327
Eat before it gets cold.

926
00:52:32,745 --> 00:52:33,705
Will do.

927
00:52:36,416 --> 00:52:37,959
Where are my manners?

928
00:52:38,042 --> 00:52:39,377
Mr. No, cut it for her.

929
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:40,712
- Yes, sir.
- No, I can do it!

930
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,218
Can you feed yourself?

931
00:52:48,428 --> 00:52:50,054
- Do you need help?
- No.

932
00:52:50,138 --> 00:52:51,472
I'm fine.

933
00:53:05,862 --> 00:53:06,863
Please eat.

934
00:53:32,847 --> 00:53:34,265
Why did you call me out here?

935
00:53:34,349 --> 00:53:36,601
Are you trying to put me in a tough spot?

936
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:38,227
Why would I?

937
00:53:38,311 --> 00:53:40,313
I didn't ask for a welcome dinner.

938
00:53:40,396 --> 00:53:42,190
And what was that huge steak?

939
00:53:42,273 --> 00:53:43,441
Did you want to kill me?

940
00:53:43,524 --> 00:53:44,525
I didn't…

941
00:53:45,068 --> 00:53:47,362
This wasn't what I had in mind.

942
00:53:47,445 --> 00:53:50,490
I saw that you couldn't eat raw fish,
so I got you steak.

943
00:53:50,573 --> 00:53:51,991
Why are you angry over that?

944
00:53:52,617 --> 00:53:53,701
You've never had to mind anyone.

945
00:53:54,327 --> 00:53:55,203
Of course not.

946
00:53:55,286 --> 00:53:57,455
You probably lived like a king
among servants.

947
00:53:58,623 --> 00:54:00,792
I feel like I'm on pins and needles

948
00:54:00,875 --> 00:54:03,336
because of your unnecessary kindness.

949
00:54:03,961 --> 00:54:05,672
I already feel self-conscious enough.

950
00:54:05,755 --> 00:54:07,006
Why do you feel self-conscious?

951
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:10,134
I was showing consideration
for this dinner I arranged.

952
00:54:10,218 --> 00:54:12,804
That wasn't consideration.
It was more like a bomb.

953
00:54:13,805 --> 00:54:16,015
From now on,
just pretend like you don't know me.

954
00:54:16,099 --> 00:54:17,558
I don't need your consideration.

955
00:54:18,142 --> 00:54:19,185
Please.

956
00:54:26,317 --> 00:54:27,902
What went wrong?

957
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,578
GONG YU-NAM

958
00:54:58,516 --> 00:55:00,059
Sa-rang!

959
00:55:00,143 --> 00:55:02,687
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday.

960
00:55:02,770 --> 00:55:06,232
-<i>Happy birthday to you</i>
-<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

961
00:55:06,315 --> 00:55:08,818
-<i>Happy birthday, dear Sa-rang</i>
-<i>Happy birthday, dear Sa-rang</i>

962
00:55:08,901 --> 00:55:10,445
-<i>Happy birthday to you</i>
-<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

963
00:55:12,321 --> 00:55:14,115
Am I allowed to be this happy?

964
00:55:14,198 --> 00:55:16,451
No, you should be even happier.
This isn't enough.

965
00:55:16,534 --> 00:55:19,203
Yes, so wish for bigger happiness
as you blow these out.

966
00:55:23,666 --> 00:55:25,042
CHEON SA-RANG'S BIRTHDAY

967
00:55:26,210 --> 00:55:27,712
Happy birthday!

968
00:55:30,882 --> 00:55:32,467
You made all this?

969
00:55:33,009 --> 00:55:34,635
Sure, I'm a seasoned homemaker.

970
00:55:34,719 --> 00:55:35,845
Thank you.

971
00:55:35,928 --> 00:55:38,055
I'm a seasoned eater.

972
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:40,516
Okay.

973
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:43,019
Here, open your present.
We picked it out together.

974
00:55:43,102 --> 00:55:44,896
Gosh, thank you.

975
00:55:47,023 --> 00:55:48,107
Let's see.

976
00:55:51,652 --> 00:55:54,030
- What is this?
- Your birthday is tomorrow.

977
00:55:54,113 --> 00:55:56,032
You can hang out with us today,

978
00:55:56,115 --> 00:55:58,576
then have a wild night
with your boyfriend tomorrow.

979
00:56:00,411 --> 00:56:02,455
He won't forget your birthday, right?

980
00:56:02,538 --> 00:56:03,539
He did last year.

981
00:56:05,583 --> 00:56:06,793
Didn't I tell you?

982
00:56:08,044 --> 00:56:09,837
We broke up a while ago.

983
00:56:10,588 --> 00:56:12,590
What? Why haven't you told us until now?

984
00:56:13,508 --> 00:56:16,135
Sorry, I forgot.
I've been too busy lately.

985
00:56:16,219 --> 00:56:17,595
How can you forget that?

986
00:56:18,262 --> 00:56:19,138
Are you all right?

987
00:56:19,847 --> 00:56:21,390
Yes, I'm fine.

988
00:56:21,891 --> 00:56:23,142
I actually feel relieved,

989
00:56:23,226 --> 00:56:26,395
almost to the point
where I wonder if I even had a boyfriend.

990
00:56:27,063 --> 00:56:28,314
I guess that was it.

991
00:56:28,397 --> 00:56:29,941
Will you get back with him?

992
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:32,777
Never.

993
00:56:39,492 --> 00:56:41,410
I'll get the beer. Turn on the music.

994
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:45,832
This is great. It's a party.

995
00:57:02,098 --> 00:57:03,975
Sa-rang, get up.

996
00:57:04,058 --> 00:57:05,977
Get up and show us.

997
00:57:06,519 --> 00:57:07,353
Get up.

998
00:57:10,982 --> 00:57:12,567
Let's go!

999
00:57:28,916 --> 00:57:31,127
HEAD MANAGER GU WON

1000
00:57:36,674 --> 00:57:37,800
Do I seem like a guy

1001
00:57:38,759 --> 00:57:40,303
who hasn't had to consider others

1002
00:57:40,386 --> 00:57:43,097
because I was born into the right family?

1003
00:57:43,764 --> 00:57:44,682
A bit.

1004
00:57:44,765 --> 00:57:46,893
But who dared to tell you such a fact?

1005
00:57:46,976 --> 00:57:48,102
How brave of them.

1006
00:57:51,230 --> 00:57:53,274
Don't mind it though.

1007
00:57:53,357 --> 00:57:54,692
You were born this way.

1008
00:57:54,775 --> 00:57:56,277
I'm only jealous.

1009
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:57,653
Please go inside, Mr. Gu.

1010
00:57:57,737 --> 00:57:59,572
I'll stop by King the Land first.

1011
00:58:00,156 --> 00:58:01,240
Why?

1012
00:58:02,116 --> 00:58:03,993
It's our kind Ms. Sa-rang's birthday,

1013
00:58:04,952 --> 00:58:06,704
so I got her our buffet voucher.

1014
00:58:06,787 --> 00:58:08,623
One of the employee benefits.

1015
00:58:34,315 --> 00:58:35,775
Look at you, showing your teeth.

1016
00:58:36,442 --> 00:58:37,735
Just leave me alone.

1017
00:58:37,818 --> 00:58:40,154
- You might bite me soon.
- I'm not doing anything

1018
00:58:40,863 --> 00:58:43,324
not because I can't fight,
but because I don't want to.

1019
00:58:44,617 --> 00:58:46,077
You say you don't want to fight,

1020
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,871
yet you went behind my back
and had a strategy meeting.

1021
00:58:48,955 --> 00:58:50,373
I'm in charge of King the Land.

1022
00:58:50,456 --> 00:58:52,041
And you're under my charge at work.

1023
00:58:52,959 --> 00:58:54,460
Didn't you know you needed

1024
00:58:54,543 --> 00:58:57,171
my permission and approval
no matter what you do?

1025
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:00,591
I didn't know.
I didn't look at the organizational chart.

1026
00:59:00,675 --> 00:59:02,510
I don't know why you came to work here,

1027
00:59:02,593 --> 00:59:04,470
but you'll have to fight me for life.

1028
00:59:05,054 --> 00:59:07,139
If you need money,
I'll give you what you want,

1029
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:08,516
so leave.

1030
00:59:08,599 --> 00:59:10,142
I have plenty of money.

1031
00:59:10,226 --> 00:59:12,186
I'm telling you for your sake.

1032
00:59:12,770 --> 00:59:14,355
Don't end up like your mom.

1033
00:59:17,066 --> 00:59:18,359
See?

1034
00:59:18,442 --> 00:59:20,194
Nobody remembers her.

1035
00:59:20,987 --> 00:59:23,114
Both you and me.

1036
00:59:25,324 --> 00:59:26,659
That's life for a loser.

1037
00:59:27,368 --> 00:59:28,286
Okay?

1038
00:59:30,496 --> 00:59:32,039
And throw out that pocket watch.

1039
00:59:33,207 --> 00:59:34,709
How childish of you.

1040
00:59:52,143 --> 00:59:53,352
Are you looking for this?

1041
00:59:54,228 --> 00:59:55,938
- Give it back.
- I don't want to.

1042
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:00,526
Give it back. It's mine.

1043
01:00:00,609 --> 01:00:02,194
She left because she didn't want you.

1044
01:00:04,572 --> 01:00:05,698
So forget about her.

1045
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,452
No!

1046
01:00:15,333 --> 01:00:16,584
No…

1047
01:00:44,695 --> 01:00:46,781
I'll be the main server.

1048
01:00:46,864 --> 01:00:48,407
You can stand quietly in the back.

1049
01:00:49,450 --> 01:00:51,786
Don't meddle
and try to sell something expensive.

1050
01:00:52,828 --> 01:00:53,871
Yes, I understand.

1051
01:01:00,836 --> 01:01:02,588
I'd like some wine recommendations.

1052
01:01:02,671 --> 01:01:05,716
We recently got nice vintages
of Charrier Margaux and Zeña.

1053
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,760
Which would go better with today's meal?

1054
01:01:07,843 --> 01:01:11,305
Let me get the sommelier
to provide a more detailed suggestion.

1055
01:01:11,389 --> 01:01:12,973
We can't wait that long.

1056
01:01:13,057 --> 01:01:14,475
Give us a suggestion.

1057
01:01:14,558 --> 01:01:18,270
Any bottle will go nicely
with the meal we have today.

1058
01:01:19,814 --> 01:01:22,775
You're that best talent, right?

1059
01:01:24,068 --> 01:01:25,486
Hello, sir.

1060
01:01:26,278 --> 01:01:28,197
She still has a great smile.

1061
01:01:29,073 --> 01:01:30,199
In that case,

1062
01:01:30,282 --> 01:01:32,910
let's get a suggestion
from the best talent of King Hotel.

1063
01:01:36,122 --> 01:01:39,834
In that case, may I suggest the Zeña?

1064
01:01:40,626 --> 01:01:42,128
It's a premium wine from Chile.

1065
01:01:42,211 --> 01:01:44,922
The smell of blackcurrant
and blackberries mixes nicely

1066
01:01:45,005 --> 01:01:48,759
with the smell of vanilla
from the oak barrel,

1067
01:01:48,843 --> 01:01:52,680
and you'll feel the fine-grained tannins
with the elegance of full-bodied wine.

1068
01:01:53,597 --> 01:01:56,517
I believe it'll go nicely
with your lamb chop steak.

1069
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:59,353
You're well-versed in wine,

1070
01:01:59,437 --> 01:02:01,021
almost like an expert.

1071
01:02:01,105 --> 01:02:03,232
I'm a certified sommelier.

1072
01:02:04,442 --> 01:02:07,194
I knew I had a discerning eye for people.

1073
01:02:08,571 --> 01:02:10,072
I really want to recruit her.

1074
01:02:10,156 --> 01:02:11,991
I'll pay you twice as much.

1075
01:02:12,074 --> 01:02:13,200
Come work at my hotel.

1076
01:02:14,243 --> 01:02:15,786
I'm flattered, sir.

1077
01:02:15,870 --> 01:02:18,122
My goodness.

1078
01:02:18,956 --> 01:02:20,708
Should we get the meal ready?

1079
01:02:20,791 --> 01:02:22,626
Sa-rang, what are you doing?

1080
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:24,795
There's a single-malt package
worth 40 million.

1081
01:02:24,879 --> 01:02:26,255
Why did you recommend wine?

1082
01:02:26,338 --> 01:02:28,841
You should've made him order whiskey.

1083
01:02:28,924 --> 01:02:32,261
This is why we say
you don't have the basics.

1084
01:02:33,387 --> 01:02:35,806
But the chairman asked
for a wine recommendation.

1085
01:02:36,432 --> 01:02:38,309
And you suggested wine too.

1086
01:02:39,018 --> 01:02:39,935
Whatever.

1087
01:02:40,019 --> 01:02:41,812
Make sure to sell more expensive items.

1088
01:02:41,896 --> 01:02:43,063
Try upselling.

1089
01:02:44,857 --> 01:02:45,900
Remember that.

1090
01:02:45,983 --> 01:02:47,234
Got it?

1091
01:02:48,903 --> 01:02:50,279
Yes, I'll remember that.

1092
01:03:12,885 --> 01:03:15,638
PERSONNEL RECORD

1093
01:03:16,430 --> 01:03:17,473
Mr. Gu.

1094
01:03:17,556 --> 01:03:20,017
If you tell me who you're looking for,
I'll look it up.

1095
01:03:21,018 --> 01:03:23,187
Can a record be left out of the server?

1096
01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:25,189
No, we typed in everyone since year one

1097
01:03:25,272 --> 01:03:27,066
as we digitized our system.

1098
01:03:27,775 --> 01:03:28,943
So why can't I find it?

1099
01:03:30,152 --> 01:03:31,487
It has to be there.

1100
01:03:31,570 --> 01:03:33,989
Our payroll and severance pay
are on our accounting system,

1101
01:03:34,073 --> 01:03:35,658
so nobody can delete the records.

1102
01:03:39,453 --> 01:03:41,372
Is that everything from 1989?

1103
01:03:41,455 --> 01:03:42,331
Yes.

1104
01:03:42,998 --> 01:03:45,793
Who are you looking for if I may ask?

1105
01:03:46,710 --> 01:03:47,711
Never mind.

1106
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:58,264
Surprise! Happy birthday.

1107
01:04:00,558 --> 01:04:01,559
What are you doing?

1108
01:04:01,642 --> 01:04:03,227
Let's go.
I made reservations at a nice spot.

1109
01:04:09,024 --> 01:04:10,234
Are you still sulking?

1110
01:04:10,317 --> 01:04:11,527
We broke up.

1111
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:13,904
I said I never wanted to see you again.

1112
01:04:13,988 --> 01:04:15,698
You weren't sulking over the <i>gimbap</i>?

1113
01:04:16,407 --> 01:04:20,077
That's why I made a reservation
at a high-end fine dining restaurant.

1114
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,662
Don't sulk over some food.

1115
01:04:21,745 --> 01:04:22,746
Hey.

1116
01:04:23,372 --> 01:04:25,916
Do you think
I broke up with you over that?

1117
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,836
If I had, I would've dumped you
hundreds of times already.

1118
01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:31,797
What do you take me for
to take what I said that way?

1119
01:04:32,464 --> 01:04:33,299
I'm sorry.

1120
01:04:33,382 --> 01:04:35,259
I'll be really good from now on.
I'm so sorry.

1121
01:04:35,342 --> 01:04:37,094
Stop saying you're sorry!

1122
01:04:40,514 --> 01:04:41,807
If you were really sorry,

1123
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:44,685
you wouldn't have acted this way
to begin with.

1124
01:04:47,563 --> 01:04:49,648
I'm sick and tired of you.

1125
01:04:51,275 --> 01:04:52,776
Let's end this.

1126
01:04:54,236 --> 01:04:55,529
You're really harsh.

1127
01:04:56,447 --> 01:04:58,866
And you're selfish.
You can't make the call alone.

1128
01:04:58,949 --> 01:04:59,908
I can.

1129
01:05:00,993 --> 01:05:03,621
My love is over,
so do whatever you want with yours.

1130
01:05:05,205 --> 01:05:06,749
I never want to see you again.

1131
01:05:07,791 --> 01:05:09,376
Have you always been this harsh?

1132
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:10,919
Are you the Sa-rang I know?

1133
01:05:12,713 --> 01:05:13,881
Let go of me.

1134
01:05:15,132 --> 01:05:16,675
We're now strangers.

1135
01:07:01,238 --> 01:07:02,614
This is my spot.

1136
01:07:04,658 --> 01:07:05,701
Excuse me?

1137
01:07:08,454 --> 01:07:09,455
This is

1138
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:12,332
my spot.

1139
01:08:02,758 --> 01:08:05,761
KING THE LAND

1140
01:08:40,587 --> 01:08:41,630
{\an8}<i>Your outfit…</i>

1141
01:08:42,422 --> 01:08:44,675
{\an8}You two look so good together.

1142
01:08:44,758 --> 01:08:45,843
{\an8}I knew it.

1143
01:08:45,926 --> 01:08:46,969
{\an8}Who are you to…

1144
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:50,013
{\an8}<i>She doesn't want to see you anymore.</i>

1145
01:08:51,348 --> 01:08:53,058
{\an8}- Why are you here?
- Why didn't you reply?

1146
01:08:53,767 --> 01:08:55,185
{\an8}- Reply to what?
- My text.

1147
01:08:55,269 --> 01:08:57,145
{\an8}- I did.
- And I replied to your reply.

1148
01:08:57,229 --> 01:08:58,063
{\an8}I'm working right now.

1149
01:09:00,649 --> 01:09:02,734
{\an8}I was just acting startled.

1150
01:09:02,818 --> 01:09:04,236
{\an8}Look, it's a heart.

1151
01:09:04,736 --> 01:09:05,571
{\an8}It's good.

1152
01:09:05,654 --> 01:09:08,949
{\an8}Your favorite food, your favorite weather,
your favorite color.

1153
01:09:09,032 --> 01:09:10,576
Tell me everything you like.

1154
01:09:10,659 --> 01:09:12,786
Why do you want to know that?

1155
01:09:15,789 --> 01:09:19,256
