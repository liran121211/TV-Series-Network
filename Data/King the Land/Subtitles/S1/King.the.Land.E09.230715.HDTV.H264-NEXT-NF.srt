1
00:00:02,446 --> 00:00:06,920
KING THE LAND

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,854
KING THE LAND

3
00:00:12,193 --> 00:00:13,806
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

4
00:00:13,887 --> 00:00:15,626
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

5
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:17,091
Now.

6
00:00:17,675 --> 00:00:20,386
This is the highlight of the meal.

7
00:00:42,533 --> 00:00:43,576
Are you all right?

8
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:45,078
Are you hurt?

9
00:00:45,161 --> 00:00:46,162
No.

10
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:51,834
What will you do with all these?

11
00:00:57,381 --> 00:00:58,841
As long as you aren't hurt,

12
00:00:59,675 --> 00:01:00,718
it's all right.

13
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,096
Do I have…

14
00:01:46,681 --> 00:01:47,807
permission?

15
00:03:46,717 --> 00:03:47,760
Here.

16
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,225
Gosh.

17
00:03:56,394 --> 00:03:57,270
Here.

18
00:03:57,353 --> 00:03:58,437
Thank you.

19
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,281
I don't know what this is,

20
00:04:08,364 --> 00:04:09,699
but it's really good.

21
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:13,244
I wanted to cook the best meal for you.

22
00:04:14,912 --> 00:04:16,247
You already did.

23
00:04:17,164 --> 00:04:18,833
It was the best meal

24
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:21,877
and the best dining atmosphere of my life.

25
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:24,797
I'm glad you liked it.

26
00:04:25,756 --> 00:04:26,882
I'll cook for you again.

27
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:28,718
I'll cook next time.

28
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:29,719
When?

29
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:31,137
Tomorrow?

30
00:04:31,929 --> 00:04:32,805
No.

31
00:04:32,888 --> 00:04:33,931
Then when?

32
00:04:37,601 --> 00:04:39,395
When you look the most adorable.

33
00:04:42,231 --> 00:04:43,149
Cheers.

34
00:04:56,495 --> 00:04:57,496
Let's eat.

35
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,835
You must really be good at everything.

36
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:04,086
Of course.

37
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:06,881
Though I don't know what this is.

38
00:05:07,882 --> 00:05:10,301
EPISODE 9

39
00:05:14,555 --> 00:05:16,849
We only need 500 more dollars.

40
00:05:21,896 --> 00:05:22,980
We're doomed.

41
00:05:23,564 --> 00:05:24,815
We're closing soon,

42
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:26,901
and there's not a person in sight.

43
00:05:27,526 --> 00:05:29,528
Ha-neul, should I just buy a bag?

44
00:05:30,738 --> 00:05:33,074
You don't want to face legal issues.

45
00:05:33,157 --> 00:05:34,700
Just go on a trip with those 500 dollars.

46
00:05:40,539 --> 00:05:42,708
But it's only fun if we all go together.

47
00:05:43,292 --> 00:05:44,877
I'll pay for a team trip
if I win the lottery.

48
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,337
You don't even buy tickets.

49
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,880
I will from now on.

50
00:05:47,963 --> 00:05:50,633
You all went through a lot
working overtime.

51
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:53,010
Let's eat grilled beef intestines.
It's on me.

52
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,846
Let's wrap up now.

53
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:56,931
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

54
00:05:57,723 --> 00:05:58,682
Yes, ma'am.

55
00:06:02,019 --> 00:06:03,646
Welcome to Alanga!

56
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:06,232
- Welcome to Alanga!
- Welcome to Alanga!

57
00:06:06,315 --> 00:06:07,441
Please come in!

58
00:06:07,525 --> 00:06:09,568
- This way, please.
- What do you think of this?

59
00:06:09,652 --> 00:06:10,778
It's the latest design.

60
00:06:11,529 --> 00:06:12,613
Thank you.

61
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:18,577
Thank you. Enjoy your trip.

62
00:06:18,661 --> 00:06:21,205
- Thank you. Enjoy your trip.
- Thank you. Enjoy your trip.

63
00:06:31,298 --> 00:06:35,010
A toast to celebrate
Purser Oh Pyeong-hwa's promotion.

64
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:37,179
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

65
00:06:37,763 --> 00:06:39,890
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

66
00:06:39,974 --> 00:06:42,059
Stop it. That's enough.

67
00:06:42,143 --> 00:06:43,144
Why?

68
00:06:43,227 --> 00:06:46,814
Ms. Yoo said the most important criteria
for promotion was in-flight sales.

69
00:06:46,897 --> 00:06:49,233
You had the most sales
and our team came in first.

70
00:06:49,316 --> 00:06:51,402
- There's no doubt about it.
- Of course.

71
00:06:51,485 --> 00:06:53,195
You've been through a lot.

72
00:06:54,405 --> 00:06:56,782
Purser Oh, once you're promoted,

73
00:06:56,866 --> 00:06:58,617
don't forget about us and help us out.

74
00:06:58,701 --> 00:07:00,077
I'll swear my allegiance.

75
00:07:00,161 --> 00:07:01,662
That's enough.

76
00:07:01,745 --> 00:07:02,997
I told you to stop.

77
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:06,333
Ma'am, over here!

78
00:07:07,543 --> 00:07:08,544
Hello.

79
00:07:10,212 --> 00:07:11,547
What took you so long?

80
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,924
We were so bored without you.

81
00:07:14,008 --> 00:07:15,759
Seems like you were having fun.

82
00:07:15,843 --> 00:07:17,219
You're better off without this old-timer.

83
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:19,263
Goodness. Why would you say that?

84
00:07:20,681 --> 00:07:22,933
- Sit over here, ma'am.
- Thank you.

85
00:07:23,434 --> 00:07:25,311
- One draft beer, please.
- Coming right up.

86
00:07:27,521 --> 00:07:29,482
You all worked so hard.

87
00:07:29,565 --> 00:07:33,402
Especially the major contributor,
Ms. Oh Pyeong-hwa, who carried our team

88
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:35,029
from last to first.

89
00:07:35,112 --> 00:07:38,282
Why don't we give her a round of applause?

90
00:07:41,243 --> 00:07:43,454
It's all thanks to you. Thank you.

91
00:07:44,788 --> 00:07:46,123
It's thanks to you all

92
00:07:46,207 --> 00:07:48,000
that our team was able to rank first.

93
00:07:49,585 --> 00:07:51,504
This is a token of my appreciation.

94
00:07:52,713 --> 00:07:55,925
I feel bad receiving this
when everyone worked so hard.

95
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:57,635
You have every right to receive it.

96
00:07:58,135 --> 00:07:59,178
Treat yourself.

97
00:07:59,803 --> 00:08:02,097
Thank you. I'll use it well.

98
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:04,558
Now for the highlight of the evening.

99
00:08:04,642 --> 00:08:06,644
I have an important announcement to make.

100
00:08:07,144 --> 00:08:10,523
Someone among us
will be promoted to purser.

101
00:08:12,858 --> 00:08:14,151
Drumroll, please.

102
00:08:14,235 --> 00:08:15,736
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR PROMOTION,
OH PYEONG-HWA

103
00:08:16,445 --> 00:08:18,405
Congratulations on your promotion.

104
00:08:18,489 --> 00:08:20,616
You've worked so hard, Mi-na.

105
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,955
Me?

106
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:27,373
Here's your purser scarf.

107
00:08:31,335 --> 00:08:32,586
Thank you.

108
00:08:33,254 --> 00:08:35,923
I'll do my best. Thank you.

109
00:08:36,507 --> 00:08:38,425
Purser Hwang, congratulations.

110
00:08:39,718 --> 00:08:40,803
Thank you.

111
00:08:43,264 --> 00:08:44,348
This is amazing.

112
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,310
As expected, it looks good on you.

113
00:08:49,895 --> 00:08:53,315
<i>- Don't bash me
- Don't bash me</i>

114
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:57,027
<i>- Saying I'm a cruel woman
- Saying I'm a cruel woman</i>

115
00:08:57,111 --> 00:09:00,114
<i>- It was for you
- It was for you</i>

116
00:09:00,197 --> 00:09:03,742
<i>That I chose to break up…</i>

117
00:09:06,495 --> 00:09:07,538
I'm sorry.

118
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:09,623
How can I dare surpass you

119
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:14,253
when you're my senior by many years?

120
00:09:16,213 --> 00:09:17,214
It's okay.

121
00:09:17,298 --> 00:09:18,799
You don't have to worry about me.

122
00:09:18,882 --> 00:09:21,552
You did a great job. Congratulations.

123
00:09:23,637 --> 00:09:26,473
Cut the nonsense about being okay.

124
00:09:26,557 --> 00:09:27,474
You must be jealous.

125
00:09:28,726 --> 00:09:32,104
If you're jealous,
just say you're jealous.

126
00:09:32,187 --> 00:09:34,148
The nonchalance
makes you look more pathetic.

127
00:09:34,231 --> 00:09:35,441
Stop drinking.

128
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:36,942
You're drunk.

129
00:09:37,026 --> 00:09:39,695
That's why you should've tried harder.

130
00:09:40,571 --> 00:09:42,698
It's such a happy day for me

131
00:09:43,407 --> 00:09:46,619
but I'm walking on eggshells around you.

132
00:09:47,828 --> 00:09:50,039
You're making me feel sorry for no reason.

133
00:09:50,873 --> 00:09:52,374
What is this?

134
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,126
How uncomfortable.

135
00:10:15,564 --> 00:10:17,524
What are you doing out here in the cold?

136
00:10:20,194 --> 00:10:21,487
You'll catch a cold.

137
00:10:23,113 --> 00:10:24,198
Thanks.

138
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,753
Are you okay?

139
00:10:40,005 --> 00:10:41,006
No.

140
00:10:42,132 --> 00:10:43,217
I'm not.

141
00:10:44,218 --> 00:10:45,886
I feel so embarrassed…

142
00:10:47,805 --> 00:10:49,431
for getting my hopes up.

143
00:10:51,016 --> 00:10:51,850
Pyeong-hwa.

144
00:10:53,143 --> 00:10:54,895
Do you remember what you said before?

145
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:58,524
"I just like flying."

146
00:11:03,862 --> 00:11:04,863
I did.

147
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:07,741
And I still do.

148
00:11:09,243 --> 00:11:10,577
I heard that people confuse

149
00:11:10,661 --> 00:11:13,414
what they want to do
with what they want to become.

150
00:11:14,748 --> 00:11:18,877
Wasn't it your dream
to be a part of beautiful flights?

151
00:11:20,754 --> 00:11:22,256
If I become a purser,

152
00:11:23,257 --> 00:11:25,217
wouldn't my flights become more beautiful?

153
00:11:25,801 --> 00:11:27,177
You're already amazing.

154
00:11:28,929 --> 00:11:32,182
I want to become
a good flight attendant like you.

155
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,685
Like me?

156
00:11:35,894 --> 00:11:37,813
Think about everything that's happened.

157
00:11:37,896 --> 00:11:39,064
Look at me right now.

158
00:11:39,648 --> 00:11:40,732
I am looking.

159
00:11:41,608 --> 00:11:42,860
I always have.

160
00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:46,572
You always try your best
to help passengers

161
00:11:46,655 --> 00:11:48,574
have a safe and comfortable flight.

162
00:11:48,657 --> 00:11:50,701
Being the best flight attendant

163
00:11:52,161 --> 00:11:53,662
is much better

164
00:11:54,371 --> 00:11:55,622
than becoming a purser.

165
00:12:03,046 --> 00:12:04,590
Thanks.

166
00:12:04,673 --> 00:12:06,175
It's not that comforting,

167
00:12:07,718 --> 00:12:09,011
but I'll try to cheer up.

168
00:12:25,694 --> 00:12:26,904
Let's walk.

169
00:13:24,127 --> 00:13:26,046
Why did you want to walk today?

170
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:27,089
Isn't it great today?

171
00:13:27,172 --> 00:13:29,258
The weather's so nice
and I'm in a good mood.

172
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:31,718
- There need to be days like this.
- How strange.

173
00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:36,014
What is this refreshing smell?

174
00:13:36,098 --> 00:13:38,725
- Did you spray cologne?
- Not "smell."

175
00:13:38,809 --> 00:13:39,810
"Scent."

176
00:13:39,893 --> 00:13:40,811
Scent.

177
00:13:40,894 --> 00:13:41,812
Perfume.

178
00:13:42,396 --> 00:13:43,522
Jeez.

179
00:13:43,605 --> 00:13:44,898
Why do you care?

180
00:13:44,982 --> 00:13:46,817
- Hello, sir.
- Yes, hello.

181
00:13:48,485 --> 00:13:49,319
Mr. Gu.

182
00:13:49,403 --> 00:13:51,572
He's the longest-working employee
at King Hotel.

183
00:13:51,655 --> 00:13:52,531
Thirty years.

184
00:13:54,157 --> 00:13:57,035
- Once you leave, make a left.
- Okay.

185
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,412
He is amazing.

186
00:14:04,001 --> 00:14:05,085
Thirty years?

187
00:14:06,753 --> 00:14:07,754
What's wrong?

188
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,258
It's nothing.

189
00:14:16,138 --> 00:14:17,055
Hello.

190
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:18,348
It's a good morning.

191
00:14:18,432 --> 00:14:19,516
Yes.

192
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,934
It is a good morning.

193
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:23,395
Today is going to be a good day.

194
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:27,274
"It's a good morning"?

195
00:14:45,792 --> 00:14:46,627
Don't.

196
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,304
What's this?

197
00:14:57,387 --> 00:14:58,555
Why do you look so happy?

198
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:01,016
You're mistaken.

199
00:15:01,099 --> 00:15:03,560
No, I'm not. There's definitely something.

200
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:05,395
Right, Sa-rang?

201
00:15:05,479 --> 00:15:06,939
I'm not sure.

202
00:15:07,564 --> 00:15:08,857
Face forward.

203
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:10,275
Why are you not sure?

204
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:11,443
That's strange.

205
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:32,005
Something's off.

206
00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:34,257
You're grinning from ear to ear.
You look crazy.

207
00:15:34,341 --> 00:15:35,592
Cut the nonsense.

208
00:15:35,676 --> 00:15:36,885
Get off.

209
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:45,644
- Why aren't you getting off?
- I'll accompany you.

210
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:47,771
I can go by myself.

211
00:15:47,854 --> 00:15:49,523
I don't want to send you alone.

212
00:15:55,237 --> 00:15:56,321
People can see us.

213
00:15:56,405 --> 00:15:58,323
Then I can just cover our hands.

214
00:16:01,243 --> 00:16:02,411
They can't see now.

215
00:16:15,882 --> 00:16:16,758
Only up to here.

216
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:17,884
No further.

217
00:16:22,431 --> 00:16:23,265
Fine.

218
00:16:23,348 --> 00:16:24,516
I'm only allowing it this once.

219
00:16:24,599 --> 00:16:25,892
You can't do this next time.

220
00:16:27,436 --> 00:16:28,478
Okay.

221
00:16:39,573 --> 00:16:41,992
I don't think you understood me.

222
00:16:53,754 --> 00:16:54,713
Go inside.

223
00:16:57,299 --> 00:16:58,258
Okay.

224
00:17:24,284 --> 00:17:25,285
He's so cool.

225
00:17:25,827 --> 00:17:27,621
I'm going to work hard today!

226
00:17:46,556 --> 00:17:47,599
He ordered coffee.

227
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:50,102
What's going on?

228
00:17:50,685 --> 00:17:52,604
Why isn't he leaving?

229
00:17:53,188 --> 00:17:56,399
I think he's here
to observe how hard we're working.

230
00:17:57,442 --> 00:17:58,860
You're right. That's it.

231
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:01,154
It's giving me chills.
I thought he was better than this.

232
00:18:01,238 --> 00:18:02,405
He's watching again.

233
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:10,705
He keeps glancing our way.

234
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:11,832
You're right.

235
00:18:11,915 --> 00:18:13,458
He's here to keep an eye on us.

236
00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:17,754
Sa-rang, go check on him.

237
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:21,424
- What do you mean?
- Check to see if he needs anything.

238
00:18:21,508 --> 00:18:23,135
Find out why he's acting like that.

239
00:18:23,218 --> 00:18:24,469
Gauge his mood.

240
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,305
- Hurry up.
- Hurry up.

241
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:30,809
All right.

242
00:18:46,616 --> 00:18:47,617
Mr. Gu,

243
00:18:48,285 --> 00:18:50,996
is there anything else
I can help you with?

244
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:51,913
No, I'm fine.

245
00:18:52,414 --> 00:18:55,208
Then why don't you consider leaving now?

246
00:18:55,292 --> 00:18:56,126
I don't want to.

247
00:18:57,627 --> 00:19:01,798
Everyone finds it uncomfortable
to see you sitting here.

248
00:19:02,424 --> 00:19:04,467
Don't mind me. Just continue working.

249
00:19:04,551 --> 00:19:05,635
Well…

250
00:19:11,641 --> 00:19:13,310
How are we supposed to do that

251
00:19:13,393 --> 00:19:15,353
when you're sitting here like this?

252
00:19:16,146 --> 00:19:18,148
- I have a meeting here later.
- What time?

253
00:19:18,231 --> 00:19:19,149
At 5 p.m.

254
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:21,985
It's 2 p.m. right now.

255
00:19:22,068 --> 00:19:23,445
Hurry up and leave.

256
00:19:23,528 --> 00:19:25,822
- I'll leave in a bit.
- Can you just leave now?

257
00:19:25,906 --> 00:19:28,116
Come on. It's because I want to see you.

258
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,534
Mr. Gu!

259
00:19:38,126 --> 00:19:41,713
We are at work right now.

260
00:19:43,131 --> 00:19:44,799
- You need to leave.
- But…

261
00:19:46,176 --> 00:19:49,512
Did you have to get so serious?

262
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:53,808
No one can work properly because of you,

263
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:55,101
including me.

264
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:01,566
Fine.

265
00:20:03,276 --> 00:20:04,778
After just one more cup.

266
00:20:05,987 --> 00:20:07,739
You already had three.

267
00:20:07,822 --> 00:20:09,741
I think it'd be best for you to leave now.

268
00:20:13,453 --> 00:20:14,496
Hurry.

269
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,082
Is that what you want?

270
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:19,251
Yes.

271
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:21,336
I beg you.

272
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,046
"Beg"?

273
00:20:32,847 --> 00:20:33,848
Okay.

274
00:20:34,808 --> 00:20:36,810
I'll disappear as you wish.

275
00:21:01,292 --> 00:21:03,336
Hi, do you know if there's any
good Korean restaurants

276
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:04,754
for foreigners in Gwanghwamun?

277
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:06,881
- Gwanghwamun?
- Yes.

278
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:09,300
I'm sorry,
I don't know much about the area.

279
00:21:10,885 --> 00:21:13,680
Would you be okay
if I recommend some restaurants

280
00:21:13,763 --> 00:21:15,348
around here instead?

281
00:21:15,849 --> 00:21:18,184
No, my meeting is at Gwanghwamun.

282
00:21:30,029 --> 00:21:32,699
VEGAN RESTAURANTS

283
00:21:32,782 --> 00:21:34,033
MUST-EAT RESTAURANTS NEAR NAMSAN

284
00:21:35,451 --> 00:21:38,454
MUST-EAT RESTAURANTS NEAR GWANGHWAMUN

285
00:21:40,915 --> 00:21:41,916
Sir,

286
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,127
there is a place called
Gwanghwamun Hanjeongsik

287
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:46,337
which is popular to global customers.

288
00:21:46,421 --> 00:21:48,631
Would you like me
to make a reservation for you?

289
00:21:48,715 --> 00:21:49,966
Yes, absolutely.

290
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:51,843
For three at seven, tonight.

291
00:21:51,924 --> 00:21:54,581
Okay. I will make a reservation for
tonight at seven,

292
00:21:55,096 --> 00:21:56,639
three people
under your name, sir.

293
00:21:56,723 --> 00:21:57,932
Great, thanks. What's your name?

294
00:21:58,016 --> 00:21:59,893
- May name is Se-ho.
- Se-ho? I appreciate it.

295
00:21:59,976 --> 00:22:00,935
Bye.

296
00:22:09,736 --> 00:22:10,945
"Thank you"

297
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:14,115
must be an expression
to use at times like this.

298
00:22:14,198 --> 00:22:15,241
Don't mention it.

299
00:22:15,742 --> 00:22:17,911
Thank yourself
for your great service skills.

300
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,955
- You're the best.
- That's true.

301
00:22:22,332 --> 00:22:24,584
But what was that notebook earlier?

302
00:22:25,418 --> 00:22:27,420
It had the restaurants'
most popular dishes,

303
00:22:27,503 --> 00:22:30,423
their locations, and notes about
the employees' foreign language skills.

304
00:22:30,506 --> 00:22:32,175
When I worked in the lobby,
a lot of foreign guests

305
00:22:32,258 --> 00:22:34,135
asked for restaurant recommendations.

306
00:22:34,218 --> 00:22:36,930
I created the list by touring
good restaurants on my days off.

307
00:22:37,805 --> 00:22:38,806
Mad respect.

308
00:22:39,557 --> 00:22:41,225
You're the best talent for a reason.

309
00:22:41,726 --> 00:22:43,019
I'm seeing you in a new light.

310
00:22:43,102 --> 00:22:45,480
Attention to detail is important
in customer service.

311
00:22:46,689 --> 00:22:48,524
I'll leave this here.

312
00:22:48,608 --> 00:22:50,526
You can look at it whenever you need to.

313
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:51,736
Is that okay?

314
00:22:51,819 --> 00:22:53,863
You're giving away
your efforts and know-how.

315
00:22:54,572 --> 00:22:55,740
What's wrong with that?

316
00:22:55,823 --> 00:22:57,075
Our team will be using it.

317
00:22:57,659 --> 00:22:59,327
We're all one family.

318
00:23:13,967 --> 00:23:17,387
Is the 100th-anniversary event preparation
going smoothly?

319
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:19,222
Yes, everything's going smoothly.

320
00:23:19,305 --> 00:23:20,556
Can you elaborate?

321
00:23:21,516 --> 00:23:23,184
This isn't just any event.

322
00:23:23,267 --> 00:23:25,687
King Hotel is the root of King Group.

323
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:29,023
This year, we're honoring
the past 100 years of the group's history,

324
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:30,817
as well as presenting our new vision.

325
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,734
I know.

326
00:23:31,818 --> 00:23:33,695
We also need to invite public officials,

327
00:23:33,778 --> 00:23:35,446
but you haven't reached out to them yet.

328
00:23:36,322 --> 00:23:40,785
They're not the type of people
to come on short notice.

329
00:23:41,411 --> 00:23:43,413
Hwa-ran is right about that.

330
00:23:43,496 --> 00:23:47,417
You need finesse when approaching
people who work for the government.

331
00:23:48,167 --> 00:23:50,670
Your sister has that network
in her pocket.

332
00:23:50,753 --> 00:23:51,879
Ask her for help.

333
00:23:52,755 --> 00:23:54,215
You entrusted me with it.

334
00:23:54,841 --> 00:23:55,925
I can handle it.

335
00:23:56,009 --> 00:23:58,011
You haven't even gotten anything done.

336
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,639
King the Land is hosting this event.

337
00:24:01,723 --> 00:24:04,225
So everything is up to me.

338
00:24:04,308 --> 00:24:06,602
No, it's a matter of the hotel.

339
00:24:07,854 --> 00:24:11,107
King Hotel's capabilities
are to be displayed through this event.

340
00:24:15,069 --> 00:24:16,070
You're right.

341
00:24:16,738 --> 00:24:19,282
The entire hotel needs to be involved.

342
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:29,792
Then from now on,

343
00:24:30,501 --> 00:24:33,129
I will take charge of the hotel.

344
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:43,639
Your sister is in charge
of King Air and Distribution,

345
00:24:43,723 --> 00:24:45,516
so you can manage the hotel.

346
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,851
However,

347
00:24:46,934 --> 00:24:48,895
you have to show me
what you're capable of.

348
00:24:48,978 --> 00:24:51,522
Once the 100th-anniversary event is over,

349
00:24:52,398 --> 00:24:53,566
let's talk again.

350
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,711
Mr. Gu, would you like some more coffee?

351
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:16,089
Absolutely not.

352
00:26:02,468 --> 00:26:04,262
I need to have a word with you.

353
00:26:11,018 --> 00:26:13,229
I thought you didn't want to
talk to me at work.

354
00:26:14,856 --> 00:26:15,940
By any chance,

355
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,068
are you upset?

356
00:26:19,152 --> 00:26:20,153
As if.

357
00:26:20,778 --> 00:26:22,196
I'm not that petty.

358
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,657
Please. You're sulking.

359
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,160
What are you saying?

360
00:26:27,702 --> 00:26:30,163
I'm just trying
not to mix business with pleasure.

361
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:31,664
As you asked.

362
00:26:33,332 --> 00:26:34,584
Goodness.

363
00:26:34,667 --> 00:26:37,837
I had no choice but to do that earlier.

364
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,755
Please. You begged me to leave.

365
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:41,549
Come on. Don't sulk over that.

366
00:26:41,632 --> 00:26:42,508
Stop.

367
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:50,391
Don't be upset.

368
00:26:55,188 --> 00:26:56,230
I mean…

369
00:26:59,525 --> 00:27:01,402
- That's not--
- Forget it.

370
00:27:01,485 --> 00:27:02,737
- But--
- I'll make sure

371
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,989
not to mix business with pleasure either.

372
00:27:05,072 --> 00:27:06,866
I understand what you mean.

373
00:27:06,949 --> 00:27:08,701
- But--
- Let's talk again next time.

374
00:27:10,745 --> 00:27:11,662
But…

375
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,336
Can you do that one more time?

376
00:27:22,048 --> 00:27:23,090
This is bad.

377
00:27:26,761 --> 00:27:27,929
This is bad.

378
00:27:30,932 --> 00:27:32,391
Mr. Gu!

379
00:27:34,644 --> 00:27:36,145
- You're the--
- Get out.

380
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:39,523
You're the best. You're the man.

381
00:27:40,441 --> 00:27:42,068
That is who you are.

382
00:27:42,777 --> 00:27:44,111
What are you saying?

383
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:46,364
I heard you finally declared war
against Ms. Gu.

384
00:27:46,447 --> 00:27:48,824
"I will take charge of the hotel."

385
00:27:49,742 --> 00:27:50,826
You're so cool.

386
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:52,995
You're awesome. Good job.

387
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:54,288
This is just the start.

388
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:57,166
I will be at the forefront.

389
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:03,172
What? Why do you look so depressed?

390
00:28:03,256 --> 00:28:04,674
You were over the moon earlier.

391
00:28:04,757 --> 00:28:07,218
Why are you down in the dumps now?

392
00:28:07,301 --> 00:28:08,386
What is it?

393
00:28:08,469 --> 00:28:09,428
What's wrong?

394
00:28:09,512 --> 00:28:10,888
It's nothing.

395
00:28:11,472 --> 00:28:12,765
I don't think so.

396
00:28:13,349 --> 00:28:15,184
Are you scared after drawing your sword?

397
00:28:15,935 --> 00:28:17,603
It's nothing like that.

398
00:28:18,896 --> 00:28:21,816
Then is it a relationship problem?

399
00:28:21,899 --> 00:28:23,609
Do you need my advice?

400
00:28:31,826 --> 00:28:33,494
- This is about someone I know.
- Okay.

401
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:35,454
He argued with his girlfriend at work.

402
00:28:35,538 --> 00:28:38,958
The reason being his girlfriend told him
to stay away from her at work.

403
00:28:39,041 --> 00:28:40,585
So the man got a little upset.

404
00:28:40,668 --> 00:28:42,169
- Yes.
- But what I don't understand

405
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:44,922
is that when the girlfriend
hugged him from behind

406
00:28:45,006 --> 00:28:46,924
to cheer him up,

407
00:28:47,008 --> 00:28:48,926
the guy shuddered.

408
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,720
He actually loved it

409
00:28:51,345 --> 00:28:52,972
but pushed her away
because he was startled.

410
00:28:53,055 --> 00:28:55,099
Why did he get startled? What an idiot.

411
00:28:55,182 --> 00:28:56,851
He must know nothing about dating.

412
00:28:57,935 --> 00:28:58,769
I <i>do</i> know!

413
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:03,357
Leave for the day.

414
00:29:05,943 --> 00:29:08,904
At this rate, you could end up
losing everything to Mr. Gu.

415
00:29:08,988 --> 00:29:13,159
Mr. Gu's greatest weapon
should not be taken lightly.

416
00:29:13,701 --> 00:29:14,535
What weapon?

417
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:15,995
The fact that he's his son.

418
00:29:21,208 --> 00:29:23,169
I received an urgent message from the US.

419
00:29:23,252 --> 00:29:24,712
They said they couldn't reach you.

420
00:29:24,795 --> 00:29:25,671
Later.

421
00:29:25,755 --> 00:29:28,007
It seems it's something urgent
regarding your son, Ji-hu.

422
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:29,675
Did you not hear me?

423
00:29:30,509 --> 00:29:32,511
Understood, ma'am.

424
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:38,976
Are you worried, Mr. Choi?

425
00:29:39,602 --> 00:29:41,312
Yes, slightly.

426
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,606
Do you not trust me?

427
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:45,858
It's not that.

428
00:29:45,941 --> 00:29:47,026
Then,

429
00:29:47,902 --> 00:29:48,986
why are you worried?

430
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,448
King Group was mine from the start.

431
00:29:53,699 --> 00:29:55,701
And it's going to stay that way.

432
00:29:55,785 --> 00:29:58,704
I'm not going to let Won have any of it.

433
00:30:00,956 --> 00:30:02,249
I'm sorry, ma'am.

434
00:30:04,001 --> 00:30:07,088
Send invitations
to the people on our side.

435
00:30:07,171 --> 00:30:09,507
Are you thinking of helping Mr. Gu?

436
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,217
Why would I help him?

437
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,761
Won may be in charge of the event,

438
00:30:14,387 --> 00:30:17,765
but it's going to be
full of people on my side.

439
00:30:19,058 --> 00:30:22,770
Won will be in charge in name only.

440
00:30:24,063 --> 00:30:25,231
Do you understand?

441
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,234
I'm here, ma'am.

442
00:31:10,317 --> 00:31:11,360
Goodness gracious.

443
00:31:11,444 --> 00:31:14,029
What brings you all the way here?

444
00:31:14,113 --> 00:31:15,197
Well…

445
00:31:16,323 --> 00:31:17,700
Oh dear.

446
00:31:17,783 --> 00:31:18,659
Be careful!

447
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:24,707
Goodness.

448
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:26,959
GENERAL MEDICAL CENTER

449
00:31:27,835 --> 00:31:29,378
Jeez, it's fine.

450
00:31:29,462 --> 00:31:30,629
Please lie down.

451
00:31:30,713 --> 00:31:34,008
Why did you bring me to the hospital
over something like this?

452
00:31:34,091 --> 00:31:35,426
You must have money to burn.

453
00:31:36,093 --> 00:31:38,304
You could've been in big trouble.

454
00:31:38,387 --> 00:31:40,848
The cartilage has degenerated
in both of your knees.

455
00:31:40,931 --> 00:31:42,516
How have you been walking all this time?

456
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,227
With my two legs. How else?

457
00:31:45,811 --> 00:31:48,689
It's normal for my joints
to act up at this age.

458
00:31:49,315 --> 00:31:51,066
It'd be weirder if they were healthy.

459
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,943
Get out of my way. I'm leaving.

460
00:31:53,694 --> 00:31:56,155
- Didn't you hear what the doctor said?
- What?

461
00:31:56,238 --> 00:31:59,575
The doctor suggested getting
knee injections while you're here.

462
00:31:59,658 --> 00:32:03,329
And considering your age,
they wanted to run a few more tests.

463
00:32:03,412 --> 00:32:04,705
What about my restaurant?

464
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:05,790
I'll take care of it.

465
00:32:05,873 --> 00:32:06,916
Goodness.

466
00:32:06,999 --> 00:32:09,710
You talk big for a guy
who can't even peel onions.

467
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:10,795
Jeez.

468
00:32:14,256 --> 00:32:15,216
Ma'am,

469
00:32:16,175 --> 00:32:17,343
no matter what you say,

470
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:21,639
until you receive injection treatment
and run all of your tests,

471
00:32:21,722 --> 00:32:23,307
you can't leave this hospital.

472
00:32:25,059 --> 00:32:26,936
I'll do what I can with your restaurant.

473
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,771
All you have to do

474
00:32:29,772 --> 00:32:32,066
is take care of your health.

475
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:35,653
What?

476
00:32:36,987 --> 00:32:38,572
How dare you glare at me?

477
00:32:41,116 --> 00:32:42,076
Look at you.

478
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:45,371
I thought you were a sluggard,
but you're quite agile.

479
00:32:45,955 --> 00:32:46,997
Gosh.

480
00:32:47,998 --> 00:32:49,667
Why did you come all the way here anyway?

481
00:32:50,376 --> 00:32:51,335
Well…

482
00:32:52,586 --> 00:32:54,505
I just dropped in while I was passing by.

483
00:32:54,588 --> 00:32:57,424
You dropped in all the way from Seoul?

484
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:58,801
I saw some flowers

485
00:33:00,261 --> 00:33:01,929
and I thought of you.

486
00:33:02,012 --> 00:33:04,598
You should be thinking of
a woman you love.

487
00:33:05,432 --> 00:33:07,476
Why did you think of me?

488
00:33:08,727 --> 00:33:10,521
There must be something going on

489
00:33:11,188 --> 00:33:12,982
between you and Sa-rang.

490
00:33:15,484 --> 00:33:16,652
How did you know?

491
00:33:16,735 --> 00:33:18,070
I can just tell.

492
00:33:18,153 --> 00:33:20,155
It's written all over your face.

493
00:33:21,365 --> 00:33:24,201
You have feelings for Sa-rang, don't you?

494
00:33:31,041 --> 00:33:33,502
Yes, I like Sa-rang.

495
00:33:34,086 --> 00:33:35,588
Then did you ask her out?

496
00:33:37,339 --> 00:33:39,758
Do I have to put it into words

497
00:33:40,634 --> 00:33:42,595
when we both know we like each other?

498
00:33:44,805 --> 00:33:45,723
Come over here.

499
00:33:45,806 --> 00:33:47,016
You can just tell me--

500
00:33:47,099 --> 00:33:48,225
Come over here!

501
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:55,858
The thing is,

502
00:33:56,609 --> 00:33:59,945
even if you feel
an emotional connection with someone,

503
00:34:00,446 --> 00:34:04,199
if you don't express
how you sincerely feel,

504
00:34:04,283 --> 00:34:05,910
it's likely they won't know.

505
00:34:07,202 --> 00:34:09,371
It's the same whether things are good

506
00:34:09,455 --> 00:34:11,290
or bad in your relationship.

507
00:34:12,249 --> 00:34:15,044
If something made you upset,

508
00:34:15,127 --> 00:34:18,172
just swallow your pride

509
00:34:19,173 --> 00:34:22,968
and tell each other what made you upset.

510
00:34:23,052 --> 00:34:26,138
You also have to listen with your heart.

511
00:34:26,221 --> 00:34:28,891
That is how you should love one another.

512
00:34:28,974 --> 00:34:30,142
Do you understand?

513
00:34:33,479 --> 00:34:34,480
Yes.

514
00:34:35,314 --> 00:34:36,482
I'll keep that in mind.

515
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:38,859
Okay. Here.

516
00:34:39,902 --> 00:34:42,988
First things first.
Sign up to be a candidate.

517
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,907
A candidate for what?

518
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:47,743
You'll be candidate number one
for Sa-rang's husband.

519
00:34:48,827 --> 00:34:52,247
I'll make a decision
after considering a few others.

520
00:34:52,331 --> 00:34:53,999
But ma'am…

521
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:55,960
Grandma.

522
00:34:58,128 --> 00:34:59,546
Grandma, are you okay?

523
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,632
I'm fine. This is nothing.

524
00:35:02,925 --> 00:35:04,301
How bad is it? Where does it hurt?

525
00:35:04,385 --> 00:35:06,261
- Are you in a lot of pain?
- Goodness.

526
00:35:06,345 --> 00:35:09,139
I told you I'm fine. It's okay.

527
00:35:10,349 --> 00:35:12,601
Why, you little…

528
00:35:12,685 --> 00:35:14,687
You're so impatient.

529
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:17,773
I can't believe you told her already.

530
00:35:17,856 --> 00:35:20,317
What are you going to do
with that big mouth of yours?

531
00:35:20,401 --> 00:35:23,529
You've been admitted,
so I had to contact your guardian.

532
00:35:23,612 --> 00:35:25,823
What? You're out.

533
00:35:25,906 --> 00:35:27,157
I disapprove.

534
00:35:27,241 --> 00:35:28,450
You get out of my way too.

535
00:35:28,534 --> 00:35:30,703
- I'm getting up.
- Where are you going?

536
00:35:30,786 --> 00:35:32,955
I need to run my restaurant.

537
00:35:33,038 --> 00:35:35,040
Who cares about the restaurant right now?

538
00:35:36,083 --> 00:35:38,919
I told you to stop working.
I make money now.

539
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:41,797
It's okay. I'm totally fine.

540
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,133
Are you going to keep worrying me?

541
00:35:44,216 --> 00:35:46,969
Do you know how I felt on my way here?

542
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,806
Please.

543
00:35:51,473 --> 00:35:53,308
Didn't I tell you to let me know

544
00:35:53,976 --> 00:35:56,395
when you're sick
or going through a tough time?

545
00:35:58,647 --> 00:36:00,858
I can't live without you.

546
00:36:02,401 --> 00:36:06,030
How am I supposed to live without you too?

547
00:36:08,991 --> 00:36:11,618
Okay. All right.

548
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:13,704
It's okay. Don't cry.

549
00:36:13,787 --> 00:36:16,331
I'll get all the treatments
and tests done,

550
00:36:16,915 --> 00:36:19,752
and I won't leave
until the doctor tells me I can.

551
00:36:19,835 --> 00:36:21,670
So stop crying. There, there.

552
00:36:23,964 --> 00:36:26,508
You promised to live longer than me.

553
00:36:26,592 --> 00:36:28,302
Stop it. I'm not dying.

554
00:36:29,344 --> 00:36:31,722
Where would I go without you?

555
00:36:32,306 --> 00:36:33,640
I won't go anywhere.

556
00:36:34,224 --> 00:36:36,810
So stop crying. Okay?

557
00:36:43,525 --> 00:36:44,777
There, there.

558
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:10,761
Don't worry.

559
00:37:10,844 --> 00:37:12,054
She'll be okay.

560
00:37:12,596 --> 00:37:13,972
Her fall wasn't that bad.

561
00:37:15,057 --> 00:37:15,933
Thank you.

562
00:37:17,267 --> 00:37:18,769
You can go first.
I'll take care of the rest.

563
00:37:20,145 --> 00:37:21,188
Let's do it together.

564
00:37:21,814 --> 00:37:23,732
No, it's okay. I can just take a taxi.

565
00:37:23,816 --> 00:37:27,611
I promised your grandmother
to take you home safely.

566
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:29,696
Let's do it together.

567
00:37:42,709 --> 00:37:45,254
Don't we just have to
switch out the lightbulb?

568
00:37:45,337 --> 00:37:48,173
No. We first need to
completely cut off the electricity

569
00:37:48,257 --> 00:37:50,175
to ensure our safety.

570
00:37:51,677 --> 00:37:52,886
Have you done this before?

571
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,346
Of course not.

572
00:37:55,848 --> 00:37:57,224
Then I'll just do it.

573
00:37:57,307 --> 00:37:58,267
No.

574
00:37:58,934 --> 00:37:59,977
I'll do it.

575
00:38:00,769 --> 00:38:01,854
Just trust me.

576
00:38:12,322 --> 00:38:13,907
- This…
- What did you do?

577
00:38:14,449 --> 00:38:18,495
All I did was place my finger there,
but all of a sudden…

578
00:38:18,579 --> 00:38:20,038
Wait. Do you have your phone?

579
00:38:20,122 --> 00:38:21,665
- Hold on.
- Where is it? Turn on the flashlight.

580
00:38:21,748 --> 00:38:23,083
My phone is…

581
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:24,835
in my car.

582
00:38:25,335 --> 00:38:27,379
- I put mine over there too.
- Hang on a second.

583
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,256
- Which way is the exit?
- What do I do?

584
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:30,507
- Okay, then let's…
- Where…

585
00:38:40,809 --> 00:38:41,935
Wait…

586
00:38:43,103 --> 00:38:45,355
- Should we go this way?
- I need to go that way.

587
00:38:45,439 --> 00:38:47,774
- Okay. I'll go.
- No, it's not that way.

588
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:49,109
- Wait. Hold on.
- Gosh.

589
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:50,861
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

590
00:38:50,944 --> 00:38:52,446
- Are you hurt?
- Freeze.

591
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:58,785
Just stay still right here.

592
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:01,455
All right?

593
00:39:02,623 --> 00:39:03,582
All right.

594
00:39:04,583 --> 00:39:05,751
- But--
- Don't.

595
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:09,755
Fine.

596
00:39:14,843 --> 00:39:16,303
What?

597
00:39:16,386 --> 00:39:18,805
Where are you?
Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

598
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:21,016
Where are you? Where in the world are you?

599
00:39:21,099 --> 00:39:22,392
- Right here.
- Oh my god!

600
00:39:22,476 --> 00:39:23,560
It's okay.

601
00:39:26,563 --> 00:39:28,440
- I'm not okay.
- What's wrong with you?

602
00:39:28,523 --> 00:39:29,608
Come on.

603
00:39:30,108 --> 00:39:31,777
Why are you always fainting?

604
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,904
Get up. Seriously.

605
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:40,911
You should go back now.

606
00:39:45,666 --> 00:39:47,000
Is that what you really want?

607
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:57,219
I want to stay with you.

608
00:39:59,638 --> 00:40:00,889
Is it just me?

609
00:40:07,688 --> 00:40:08,730
No.

610
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:11,233
I feel the same way.

611
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:20,951
I'm sorry about yesterday.

612
00:40:22,494 --> 00:40:24,079
I can be so clueless sometimes.

613
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:27,249
I guess

614
00:40:27,874 --> 00:40:29,793
I made a fuss

615
00:40:29,876 --> 00:40:33,130
because it felt like
you didn't miss me or like me back.

616
00:40:36,383 --> 00:40:37,843
Sorry for making you feel uncomfortable.

617
00:40:41,555 --> 00:40:43,765
I'm also sorry for snapping at you.

618
00:40:44,349 --> 00:40:46,435
I could've been more gentle,

619
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:49,396
but I was worried about what
the others would think,

620
00:40:49,479 --> 00:40:51,106
so I was on edge.

621
00:40:53,859 --> 00:40:54,901
No.

622
00:40:55,986 --> 00:40:57,029
I'm sorry.

623
00:41:03,827 --> 00:41:04,870
I'm sorry too.

624
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:12,711
If I ever make a mistake again,

625
00:41:13,253 --> 00:41:14,796
you can sulk all you want.

626
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:17,257
I'll handle it.

627
00:41:18,633 --> 00:41:21,595
Even if it may take a while,
I'll make sure to cheer you up.

628
00:41:22,637 --> 00:41:24,306
So when you're with me,

629
00:41:25,223 --> 00:41:26,558
don't suppress your emotions.

630
00:41:28,143 --> 00:41:29,603
Just be yourself.

631
00:41:37,486 --> 00:41:38,653
Come to think of it,

632
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:44,534
I don't think
I've ever expressed how I truly feel.

633
00:42:02,886 --> 00:42:06,515
I like you a lot.

634
00:42:15,649 --> 00:42:16,983
Will you accept my feelings?

635
00:43:21,173 --> 00:43:24,926
But do we have to stay
this far away from each other?

636
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:26,470
This is my grandma's room.

637
00:43:27,596 --> 00:43:28,555
I know that.

638
00:43:28,638 --> 00:43:29,806
But…

639
00:43:31,641 --> 00:43:33,143
You're so far away.

640
00:43:33,226 --> 00:43:34,394
I can barely hear you.

641
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:36,104
Hello?

642
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:38,482
Can you hear me?

643
00:43:40,442 --> 00:43:44,279
Do you want to go to Seoul this instant
or do you want to sleep outside?

644
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:46,573
Really?

645
00:43:47,866 --> 00:43:48,700
You're so adamant.

646
00:43:50,744 --> 00:43:52,954
We have to get up early tomorrow to prep.

647
00:43:53,455 --> 00:43:56,166
We only have three hours before then,
so go to sleep.

648
00:43:57,834 --> 00:43:58,793
Fine.

649
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,306
- What was that?
- Let's sleep.

650
00:44:16,853 --> 00:44:18,104
Hurry up and go to sleep.

651
00:44:21,399 --> 00:44:22,442
It's our second time.

652
00:44:24,069 --> 00:44:25,111
What do you mean?

653
00:44:26,238 --> 00:44:27,447
Sleeping in the same room.

654
00:44:28,615 --> 00:44:30,158
Last time, there were two rooms.

655
00:44:30,242 --> 00:44:32,035
You were so snappy then.

656
00:44:32,118 --> 00:44:33,745
You were such a jerk then.

657
00:44:37,749 --> 00:44:39,209
Even though I kept

658
00:44:40,252 --> 00:44:41,920
giving you the death stare,

659
00:44:43,588 --> 00:44:44,714
on the inside,

660
00:44:45,715 --> 00:44:46,758
I was thinking, "What?"

661
00:44:47,759 --> 00:44:48,802
"Why do I like her?"

662
00:44:50,095 --> 00:44:51,429
"Why does she look cute?"

663
00:44:52,305 --> 00:44:53,223
Really.

664
00:44:55,725 --> 00:44:57,227
Come to think of it,

665
00:44:58,061 --> 00:45:00,105
I liked everything about you
from the start.

666
00:45:06,278 --> 00:45:09,447
Thank you for liking everything about me.

667
00:45:17,706 --> 00:45:19,124
I'll always be next to you.

668
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:22,544
I'll always be in your line of sight.

669
00:45:24,671 --> 00:45:25,797
I'll always be

670
00:45:27,173 --> 00:45:28,341
within arm's reach.

671
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:38,143
Now I can see you clearly.

672
00:45:43,023 --> 00:45:44,065
Let's sleep.

673
00:46:26,232 --> 00:46:27,442
This isn't…

674
00:46:28,568 --> 00:46:30,779
- Hey, you punk!
- Don't get the wrong idea, ma'am.

675
00:46:30,862 --> 00:46:32,280
I swear I didn't do anything.

676
00:46:32,364 --> 00:46:35,325
What? You didn't do anything?

677
00:46:35,408 --> 00:46:38,703
Yes, I swear. I only held her hand, ma'am.

678
00:46:38,787 --> 00:46:39,871
Why you little…

679
00:46:39,954 --> 00:46:42,374
- You punk.
- Why?

680
00:46:42,457 --> 00:46:43,917
- You idiot.
- What did I do?

681
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,086
- You idiot. You call yourself a man?
- What?

682
00:46:46,169 --> 00:46:47,504
Are you a man, you punk?

683
00:46:47,587 --> 00:46:49,089
- Grandma.
- You just held her hand?

684
00:46:49,172 --> 00:46:50,340
Darn you.

685
00:46:56,513 --> 00:46:58,223
You're not going to the hospital?

686
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:02,727
Why would I go back there
when I finished all of my treatments?

687
00:47:02,811 --> 00:47:04,062
Then where are you going?

688
00:47:04,145 --> 00:47:05,814
I'll be back soon.

689
00:47:05,897 --> 00:47:07,524
You should peel the onions

690
00:47:07,607 --> 00:47:08,775
and get the fire ready.

691
00:47:08,858 --> 00:47:10,151
- Let's go.
- Yes, ma'am.

692
00:47:10,235 --> 00:47:11,403
You're taking him too?

693
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:14,322
What's going on?

694
00:47:15,073 --> 00:47:16,366
- Hurry up.
- Yes, ma'am.

695
00:47:18,076 --> 00:47:19,494
Where are you going?

696
00:47:25,834 --> 00:47:27,210
Ms. Cha!

697
00:47:27,293 --> 00:47:28,503
Drink one of these.

698
00:47:35,051 --> 00:47:35,927
Who is this?

699
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:37,220
Your grandson-in-law?

700
00:47:37,303 --> 00:47:38,847
Don't be absurd.

701
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:40,807
He's just one of the men
who chase after Sa-rang.

702
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:42,308
A candidate.

703
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:43,518
I see.

704
00:47:43,601 --> 00:47:44,853
You're so handsome.

705
00:47:44,936 --> 00:47:49,774
That's the least he can do
to be in Sa-rang's league.

706
00:47:49,858 --> 00:47:51,401
She's on another level.

707
00:47:51,484 --> 00:47:52,569
You're right.

708
00:47:53,153 --> 00:47:55,155
- Drink this.
- I'm okay.

709
00:47:55,238 --> 00:47:56,739
It's my treat. Just drink it.

710
00:47:57,323 --> 00:47:58,992
Thank you. I appreciate it.

711
00:48:00,326 --> 00:48:01,369
Sun-hui!

712
00:48:04,706 --> 00:48:06,416
I heard you went to the hospital.

713
00:48:08,168 --> 00:48:09,961
Have one of these for a swift recovery.

714
00:48:10,044 --> 00:48:10,879
Okay.

715
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:13,381
Who is he?

716
00:48:13,465 --> 00:48:15,717
- Her grandson-in-law?
- No.

717
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,720
He's just one of the many men
who chase after Sa-rang.

718
00:48:18,803 --> 00:48:20,513
He's just a candidate.

719
00:48:26,811 --> 00:48:27,645
So?

720
00:48:28,229 --> 00:48:30,148
How long have you chased after Sa-rang?

721
00:48:30,773 --> 00:48:32,775
- Well--
- By the way, do you have a job?

722
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:36,529
- Yes, I--
- He works at the same hotel as Sa-rang.

723
00:48:37,113 --> 00:48:38,239
King Hotel.

724
00:48:38,323 --> 00:48:40,950
The best hotel in the country.

725
00:48:41,659 --> 00:48:44,537
It costs several hundred thousand won
for one night.

726
00:48:45,371 --> 00:48:47,040
No matter how great the hotel is,

727
00:48:47,123 --> 00:48:49,417
it's still just a huge inn.

728
00:48:49,501 --> 00:48:52,962
My grandson-in-law
works for a major company in Seoul.

729
00:48:53,046 --> 00:48:54,589
Goodness.

730
00:48:54,672 --> 00:48:57,467
A hotel is almost a major company.

731
00:48:57,550 --> 00:48:59,302
But do you own a house?

732
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:09,854
I don't feel the need to yet.

733
00:49:09,938 --> 00:49:11,231
Goodness.

734
00:49:11,314 --> 00:49:14,901
I can't believe I'm hearing someone say
they don't need a house.

735
00:49:14,984 --> 00:49:17,403
It's not easy to buy a house in Seoul.

736
00:49:17,487 --> 00:49:20,490
He can take his time.
Why are you worried about his house?

737
00:49:20,573 --> 00:49:21,533
It's okay.

738
00:49:21,616 --> 00:49:25,745
My grandson-in-law bought a house.

739
00:49:25,828 --> 00:49:27,080
He's only paid off half the mortgage.

740
00:49:29,249 --> 00:49:30,458
You're all chatting again?

741
00:49:30,542 --> 00:49:31,960
Aren't you going to work?

742
00:49:40,385 --> 00:49:42,136
- Eat it with this.
- Thank you.

743
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:43,471
- Enjoy.
- Hey, my daughter-in-law.

744
00:49:43,555 --> 00:49:44,806
- Yes?
- More radish kimchi, please.

745
00:49:44,889 --> 00:49:46,307
Okay. Radish kimchi.

746
00:49:49,602 --> 00:49:51,229
Where did they go?

747
00:49:56,192 --> 00:49:58,319
What do you like about Sa-rang?

748
00:50:00,488 --> 00:50:01,614
Just everything.

749
00:50:02,198 --> 00:50:03,449
There's nothing I dislike about her.

750
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:06,494
Do you know how long Sa-rang lived here?

751
00:50:07,078 --> 00:50:08,746
She used to live here?

752
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:10,498
Since when?

753
00:50:10,999 --> 00:50:12,709
I ask the questions.

754
00:50:12,792 --> 00:50:13,918
You just answer.

755
00:50:14,836 --> 00:50:15,670
Yes, ma'am.

756
00:50:16,254 --> 00:50:19,048
What's Sa-rang's favorite food?

757
00:50:22,218 --> 00:50:23,261
She doesn't like raw fish.

758
00:50:23,344 --> 00:50:25,430
Did I ask you what she doesn't like?

759
00:50:25,513 --> 00:50:27,765
I asked you what she likes.

760
00:50:29,225 --> 00:50:33,104
I will find out one by one.

761
00:50:35,648 --> 00:50:37,650
If you like her,

762
00:50:37,734 --> 00:50:40,445
you should first find out
what kind of life she's lived

763
00:50:40,528 --> 00:50:41,946
and what kind of person she is.

764
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:43,489
How can you just declare you like her

765
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:45,366
when you don't know anything about her?

766
00:50:46,326 --> 00:50:49,537
You don't pass as Sa-rang's partner.

767
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:53,791
Get up.

768
00:50:54,792 --> 00:50:57,045
YANGGIL BANK

769
00:50:57,128 --> 00:50:58,504
- Hello, ma'am.
- Yes.

770
00:51:04,302 --> 00:51:07,263
This must be the man
who's been chasing after Sa-rang, right?

771
00:51:07,347 --> 00:51:08,765
Your potential grandson-in-law.

772
00:51:09,265 --> 00:51:10,725
Yes, that's me.

773
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:14,395
Ms. Cha is a hard nut to crack.

774
00:51:14,479 --> 00:51:15,730
You're in for a rough ride.

775
00:51:16,689 --> 00:51:17,899
What can I help you with?

776
00:51:17,982 --> 00:51:19,484
Another savings account?

777
00:51:19,567 --> 00:51:21,277
A housing subscription account.

778
00:51:21,361 --> 00:51:22,654
Really? Why?

779
00:51:22,737 --> 00:51:23,946
You already have a house.

780
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:26,282
It's not for me. It's for him.

781
00:51:27,158 --> 00:51:29,452
This is for the first month.

782
00:51:29,535 --> 00:51:31,704
Starting next month,
you make the deposits.

783
00:51:33,915 --> 00:51:36,209
You're already taking care of
your grandson-in-law.

784
00:51:36,292 --> 00:51:38,294
You're so loving, ma'am.

785
00:51:38,378 --> 00:51:40,296
Grandson-in-law, my foot.

786
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:42,131
He's just a candidate.

787
00:51:44,175 --> 00:51:46,135
Is this your first time at a bank?

788
00:51:46,219 --> 00:51:47,595
Your ID.

789
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:49,347
Right. Yes, ma'am.

790
00:51:52,308 --> 00:51:53,309
Here you go.

791
00:51:54,519 --> 00:51:56,396
Please wait here. I'll make a quick copy.

792
00:52:01,192 --> 00:52:02,568
Thank you, ma'am.

793
00:52:03,653 --> 00:52:04,946
I'll save a lot of money.

794
00:52:05,029 --> 00:52:06,864
You don't need a house right now.

795
00:52:07,615 --> 00:52:10,827
You and Sa-rang
can work hard and save money.

796
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:13,413
Don't let something like that
get you down.

797
00:52:14,455 --> 00:52:16,332
Just work hard

798
00:52:16,416 --> 00:52:18,668
and live a good life. Okay?

799
00:52:21,045 --> 00:52:25,133
Then are you finally
giving me your approval?

800
00:52:27,218 --> 00:52:29,262
Didn't you hear me?

801
00:52:29,345 --> 00:52:31,097
You're no good.

802
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:32,265
You don't pass.

803
00:52:38,438 --> 00:52:40,231
Wow, what's all this?

804
00:52:40,314 --> 00:52:41,899
Is this a feast?

805
00:52:41,983 --> 00:52:44,736
I just prepared the usual dishes
with not much effort.

806
00:52:45,361 --> 00:52:46,904
Eat up.

807
00:52:46,988 --> 00:52:47,989
Thank you.

808
00:52:52,118 --> 00:52:53,786
Grandma's food is the best.

809
00:52:54,328 --> 00:52:56,414
- So don't be sick.
- Okay.

810
00:52:56,497 --> 00:52:58,916
Hey, eat this first.

811
00:52:59,959 --> 00:53:02,170
I asked them to give me their best cut.

812
00:53:02,253 --> 00:53:05,381
But I'm not sure
if it'll be tender and juicy.

813
00:53:05,465 --> 00:53:07,300
- Thank you.
- Sure.

814
00:53:12,597 --> 00:53:15,183
Here. You should try it too.

815
00:53:17,185 --> 00:53:18,019
It's amazing.

816
00:53:18,811 --> 00:53:20,062
- Is that so?
- Yes.

817
00:53:20,146 --> 00:53:22,440
- You should have some too.
- Okay, I will.

818
00:53:28,154 --> 00:53:29,197
It's so good.

819
00:53:30,531 --> 00:53:31,365
Please eat.

820
00:53:31,449 --> 00:53:32,533
Okay.

821
00:53:39,999 --> 00:53:44,462
She told me I was the number one candidate
for grandson-in-law.

822
00:53:44,545 --> 00:53:46,547
Is that why she cooked for you?

823
00:53:47,381 --> 00:53:48,216
How odd.

824
00:53:49,175 --> 00:53:50,218
By the way,

825
00:53:52,553 --> 00:53:53,846
what's your favorite food?

826
00:53:56,933 --> 00:53:58,017
Maybe spring rolls?

827
00:53:58,100 --> 00:53:59,143
That's it?

828
00:53:59,852 --> 00:54:02,271
What do you mean?
Spring rolls are amazing.

829
00:54:03,856 --> 00:54:06,025
- What about you?
- I'll go with spring rolls too.

830
00:54:06,859 --> 00:54:08,277
- What?
- I mean,

831
00:54:08,861 --> 00:54:11,656
you're the person I like.

832
00:54:11,739 --> 00:54:13,241
So I like what you like.

833
00:54:14,033 --> 00:54:15,493
Let's go eat them sometime.

834
00:54:15,993 --> 00:54:16,869
Okay.

835
00:54:23,167 --> 00:54:24,710
Should we take one more lap?

836
00:54:26,671 --> 00:54:28,881
I think we've taken over ten laps already.

837
00:54:29,549 --> 00:54:30,591
Then…

838
00:54:32,009 --> 00:54:33,553
we can just make it 20.

839
00:54:38,891 --> 00:54:39,725
I'll allow it.

840
00:54:41,853 --> 00:54:42,937
Let's go.

841
00:54:44,814 --> 00:54:45,857
Sa-rang!

842
00:54:49,277 --> 00:54:50,486
Where are you coming from?

843
00:54:51,237 --> 00:54:52,154
What's up?

844
00:54:53,322 --> 00:54:55,074
Goodness. Mr. No.

845
00:54:56,117 --> 00:54:57,326
Mr. No?

846
00:54:59,662 --> 00:55:00,830
It's really him.

847
00:55:07,378 --> 00:55:08,838
What is all of this?

848
00:55:08,921 --> 00:55:10,882
I'm going to drink like a fish tonight.

849
00:55:11,382 --> 00:55:14,010
She can't survive right now
without drinking.

850
00:55:14,093 --> 00:55:16,137
Why? Did something happen?

851
00:55:16,762 --> 00:55:18,598
You know what an incentive trip is, right?

852
00:55:18,681 --> 00:55:21,142
We reached our goal
after working our butts off for a month.

853
00:55:22,018 --> 00:55:24,020
But they sent us on a day trip to Bali.

854
00:55:24,103 --> 00:55:25,897
A day trip to Bali?

855
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:26,939
Yes.

856
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:28,274
I just got back.

857
00:55:42,163 --> 00:55:43,497
Hey!

858
00:55:43,581 --> 00:55:45,499
You ruined my hair.

859
00:55:46,083 --> 00:55:48,127
Good grief.

860
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:49,128
I'm sorry.

861
00:55:49,211 --> 00:55:50,630
Do you want to check these?

862
00:55:54,425 --> 00:55:56,093
There's nothing special about Bali.

863
00:55:56,594 --> 00:55:59,722
With a beach and a palm tree,
we're basically there.

864
00:56:00,348 --> 00:56:03,225
YOU BETTER BALI-VE IT

865
00:56:03,309 --> 00:56:05,561
So you're saying we can't go?

866
00:56:05,645 --> 00:56:06,854
Yes, that's right.

867
00:56:06,938 --> 00:56:08,689
This time, we can settle for this.

868
00:56:08,773 --> 00:56:10,232
We'll go to Thailand next time.

869
00:56:10,316 --> 00:56:14,195
You said we'd go to Southeast Asia
if we reached 30%.

870
00:56:14,278 --> 00:56:18,157
We worked our butts off
without any bathroom breaks.

871
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,325
Tell me about it.

872
00:56:19,408 --> 00:56:23,579
Next time, I'll do whatever it takes
to get you girls a trip to Thailand.

873
00:56:23,663 --> 00:56:25,706
So let's increase the sales a little more.

874
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:26,916
Ms. Do.

875
00:56:26,999 --> 00:56:28,918
We came somewhere nice.

876
00:56:29,001 --> 00:56:31,837
Don't ruin the mood.
Let's talk about good things only.

877
00:56:32,421 --> 00:56:35,341
I've been to Bali before.
It's identical to this place.

878
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:38,052
It's a waste of time to fly there!

879
00:56:38,594 --> 00:56:39,428
Hey.

880
00:56:40,638 --> 00:56:41,555
The special effects.

881
00:56:44,433 --> 00:56:45,559
Is this good?

882
00:56:45,643 --> 00:56:47,561
- Yes.
- Keep smiling.

883
00:56:47,645 --> 00:56:49,480
Nice. Wonderful.

884
00:56:49,563 --> 00:56:50,648
- You look like Lee Hyo-ri.
- Me?

885
00:56:50,731 --> 00:56:52,066
<i>That's the worst.</i>

886
00:56:52,149 --> 00:56:53,484
She's so evil.

887
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:55,987
She's just like my supervisor.

888
00:56:56,070 --> 00:56:57,446
What did your supervisor do?

889
00:56:58,155 --> 00:57:00,408
She promised to make Pyeong-hwa a purser

890
00:57:00,491 --> 00:57:02,576
if she increased sales,
so she made her team first.

891
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:04,704
But instead,
she promoted Pyeong-hwa's junior,

892
00:57:04,787 --> 00:57:06,038
her favorite.

893
00:57:06,122 --> 00:57:09,792
She wouldn't have worked to the point of
hurting her back had she known.

894
00:57:09,875 --> 00:57:13,129
Are in-flight sales
that important for becoming a purser?

895
00:57:13,212 --> 00:57:16,632
They bring in a lot of money
thanks to their high profit margin.

896
00:57:17,133 --> 00:57:19,010
The company keeps pushing us.

897
00:57:19,093 --> 00:57:21,220
If your team doesn't reach
its monthly sales target,

898
00:57:21,304 --> 00:57:22,513
you'll get a poor performance rating.

899
00:57:22,596 --> 00:57:25,141
Are there any incentives
for selling a lot?

900
00:57:25,224 --> 00:57:26,726
No, there aren't.

901
00:57:26,809 --> 00:57:28,311
If I do well, it's a given.

902
00:57:28,394 --> 00:57:30,438
If I do poorly,
I get on my superiors' bad side.

903
00:57:31,522 --> 00:57:33,399
What do you expect from King Group?

904
00:57:33,482 --> 00:57:36,485
Even Sa-rang was chosen
as the best talent for two years straight,

905
00:57:36,569 --> 00:57:38,612
but all she was given was
a smiley face badge.

906
00:57:39,405 --> 00:57:40,614
Hold on.

907
00:57:41,407 --> 00:57:44,952
You were chosen as the best talent
for two consecutive years,

908
00:57:45,036 --> 00:57:46,287
but all you got was a badge?

909
00:57:47,163 --> 00:57:49,206
Since it was two years, I got two badges.

910
00:57:50,041 --> 00:57:51,959
I wasn't expecting anything, so it's okay.

911
00:57:52,043 --> 00:57:54,628
It's not okay.
You always say that with everything.

912
00:57:54,712 --> 00:57:56,881
What can I do if it's not okay?

913
00:58:01,177 --> 00:58:03,012
So the best talent only got a badge.

914
00:58:03,596 --> 00:58:06,057
Da-eul, even after reaching your goal,

915
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:08,142
you weren't given the trip
you were promised.

916
00:58:08,225 --> 00:58:12,438
Pyeong-hwa, you were promised a promotion
if your team came in first,

917
00:58:12,521 --> 00:58:13,814
but someone else got it.

918
00:58:15,149 --> 00:58:16,734
It's my fault for being so naive.

919
00:58:17,610 --> 00:58:19,070
Why in the world…

920
00:58:19,153 --> 00:58:21,572
The company should recognize
and reward its employees.

921
00:58:21,655 --> 00:58:23,616
Also, a superior not keeping their word?

922
00:58:23,699 --> 00:58:27,328
How does it make sense
for a superior to break their promise?

923
00:58:27,411 --> 00:58:28,287
It does.

924
00:58:28,371 --> 00:58:30,790
The higher-ups only look up.

925
00:58:30,873 --> 00:58:32,708
They don't care about us.

926
00:58:32,792 --> 00:58:35,961
If things go well, it's thanks to them.
If not, it's our fault.

927
00:58:36,045 --> 00:58:37,755
Why is that your fault?

928
00:58:38,339 --> 00:58:40,383
All three of you are not at fault.

929
00:58:40,466 --> 00:58:41,884
The fault lies in the company

930
00:58:41,967 --> 00:58:43,636
and your superiors for tricking you.

931
00:58:44,345 --> 00:58:47,264
We cannot let this slide.

932
00:58:47,848 --> 00:58:52,645
I'll do whatever it takes
and take responsibility to amend this.

933
00:58:53,771 --> 00:58:55,815
- Wait.
- Won't it be difficult for you

934
00:58:55,898 --> 00:58:57,024
to do much as a manager?

935
00:58:57,858 --> 00:58:58,943
I know, right?

936
00:58:59,026 --> 00:59:00,528
If he were a department manager…

937
00:59:00,611 --> 00:59:01,862
That's hard too.

938
00:59:01,946 --> 00:59:03,447
He needs to be a head manager at least.

939
00:59:03,531 --> 00:59:05,866
Hey, didn't you hear what Sa-rang said?

940
00:59:05,950 --> 00:59:09,120
She said her head manager
was a total jerk.

941
00:59:09,203 --> 00:59:10,746
He goes to work for fun.

942
00:59:10,830 --> 00:59:13,124
He wouldn't care about us lowlings.

943
00:59:13,874 --> 00:59:15,251
Right, Sa-rang?

944
00:59:21,674 --> 00:59:22,591
No.

945
00:59:23,926 --> 00:59:26,929
No. He's not a jerk anymore.

946
00:59:27,012 --> 00:59:28,514
He's a really nice person.

947
00:59:28,597 --> 00:59:30,558
Hey, get your head straight.

948
00:59:30,641 --> 00:59:32,309
As is the king, so are the subjects.

949
00:59:32,393 --> 00:59:34,937
If he were a good person,
we wouldn't be suffering like this.

950
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:36,021
Right, Mr. No?

951
00:59:36,689 --> 00:59:37,982
I think he's all right.

952
00:59:38,065 --> 00:59:40,317
Someone like Mr. No
should be the head manager.

953
00:59:40,401 --> 00:59:41,444
You're right.

954
00:59:41,527 --> 00:59:45,030
Okay. May Mr. No become the head manager!

955
00:59:47,950 --> 00:59:50,369
It doesn't matter who does it.

956
00:59:50,453 --> 00:59:52,204
If you work this hard for the company,

957
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:54,206
the company should also treat you well.

958
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:56,333
I don't even expect that much.

959
00:59:56,417 --> 00:59:59,211
I just want to be appreciated
for the work that I do.

960
01:00:00,045 --> 01:00:03,132
Why do we have to wish for something
that should already be given?

961
01:00:03,716 --> 01:00:06,218
We deserve what we deserve.

962
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:15,478
Anyway, it is an honor.

963
01:00:15,561 --> 01:00:18,230
The best employee at King Air,
King Distribution,

964
01:00:18,314 --> 01:00:19,940
and King Hotel.

965
01:00:20,024 --> 01:00:23,194
I'm with the best employees
of King Group right now.

966
01:00:24,153 --> 01:00:25,237
Like I said,

967
01:00:25,321 --> 01:00:27,781
you should be the head manager, Mr. No.

968
01:00:27,865 --> 01:00:29,992
If you run for the position,
I'll vote for you.

969
01:00:30,075 --> 01:00:31,869
It's Mr. No.

970
01:00:31,952 --> 01:00:33,496
- It's Mr. No.
- It's Mr. No.

971
01:00:33,579 --> 01:00:35,039
- It's Mr. No.
- It's Mr. No.

972
01:00:35,122 --> 01:00:38,876
Since you guys are rooting for me,
I can't sit still.

973
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:42,213
Order everything you want to eat tonight.

974
01:00:42,296 --> 01:00:44,507
On behalf of the company, I…

975
01:00:49,178 --> 01:00:50,304
As a manager,

976
01:00:51,138 --> 01:00:52,264
I'll pay for everything!

977
01:00:53,432 --> 01:00:55,434
Come on!

978
01:00:55,518 --> 01:00:56,769
Come on!

979
01:00:56,852 --> 01:00:58,395
Mr. No!

980
01:00:58,896 --> 01:01:00,856
"Gang Da-eul, Oh Pyeong-hwa,

981
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:02,274
Cheon Sa-rang"?

982
01:01:02,858 --> 01:01:03,817
The kind Ms. Sa-rang?

983
01:01:03,901 --> 01:01:05,236
What is this?

984
01:01:05,319 --> 01:01:09,448
The number one employees
of King Distribution, Air, and Hotel.

985
01:01:09,532 --> 01:01:11,325
They are King Group's best employees.

986
01:01:11,408 --> 01:01:13,661
Prepare an overseas trip
as their incentive.

987
01:01:13,744 --> 01:01:15,746
The remaining employees
will be sent in turn.

988
01:01:15,829 --> 01:01:19,083
Why are you so concerned
about the employees' incentive trips?

989
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,628
The company should reward them
for their performance.

990
01:01:22,711 --> 01:01:24,046
Isn't that a given?

991
01:01:24,672 --> 01:01:26,632
I've never seen
such an openhanded company.

992
01:01:31,303 --> 01:01:32,388
There's one right here.

993
01:01:32,930 --> 01:01:34,890
- Ms. Gu's approval is needed, right?
- No.

994
01:01:35,474 --> 01:01:37,476
I'm making all the decisions
about the hotel.

995
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:40,437
With employees from Distribution and Air,
it's the group's issue.

996
01:01:40,521 --> 01:01:42,565
- Will you be okay?
- You may proceed.

997
01:01:42,648 --> 01:01:44,525
I'll take responsibility.

998
01:01:44,608 --> 01:01:46,068
They are our group's best employees,

999
01:01:46,151 --> 01:01:49,905
so it needs to be the finest
and most luxurious experience.

1000
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:59,039
Me?

1001
01:02:03,210 --> 01:02:04,044
"A nice trip"?

1002
01:02:04,128 --> 01:02:06,046
WE'LL REWARD YOU WITH A NICE TRIP

1003
01:02:07,298 --> 01:02:08,465
What?

1004
01:02:08,549 --> 01:02:12,469
"Ms. Oh Pyeong-hwa, thank you
for your devotion and hard work."

1005
01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:15,055
"We'll reward you with a nice trip."

1006
01:02:16,307 --> 01:02:17,266
Congratulations.

1007
01:02:17,349 --> 01:02:20,060
The best staff of the group
are being given incentive trips.

1008
01:02:20,728 --> 01:02:21,854
Congratulations.

1009
01:02:30,654 --> 01:02:31,697
Thank you.

1010
01:02:35,409 --> 01:02:38,037
They're leaving tomorrow.
Is everything ready?

1011
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:39,163
Of course.

1012
01:02:39,246 --> 01:02:41,874
They will experience
the best trip of their lives.

1013
01:02:41,957 --> 01:02:43,292
You'll be shocked.

1014
01:02:47,296 --> 01:02:48,255
Get in, sir.

1015
01:02:48,339 --> 01:02:50,132
What? You've never done this before.

1016
01:02:50,215 --> 01:02:51,925
No, this is what I usually do

1017
01:02:52,009 --> 01:02:54,970
as King Group's best assistant.
You know that, right?

1018
01:03:04,021 --> 01:03:06,398
- Are you sick?
- No, I'm perfectly fine.

1019
01:03:12,196 --> 01:03:13,614
I'll drive you home safely.

1020
01:03:31,298 --> 01:03:32,132
I'm so excited.

1021
01:03:34,176 --> 01:03:35,511
- I'm so happy!
- Hey!

1022
01:03:37,429 --> 01:03:39,264
Oh my. Mr. No!

1023
01:03:39,348 --> 01:03:40,265
You're here.

1024
01:03:40,349 --> 01:03:42,226
This is all thanks to you.

1025
01:03:42,309 --> 01:03:43,394
I didn't do anything.

1026
01:03:43,477 --> 01:03:46,271
We're going on this trip
because you told the higher-ups.

1027
01:03:46,355 --> 01:03:47,940
You'll be blessed.

1028
01:03:48,023 --> 01:03:49,566
Thank you so much.

1029
01:03:50,776 --> 01:03:53,821
For this trip,
let's forget about everything

1030
01:03:53,904 --> 01:03:55,698
and make this a happy, exciting,

1031
01:03:55,781 --> 01:03:57,199
and comfortable trip.

1032
01:03:57,282 --> 01:03:58,701
Let's go relax.

1033
01:03:58,784 --> 01:03:59,702
- Okay!
- Okay!

1034
01:04:00,285 --> 01:04:01,328
Let's go then.

1035
01:04:07,821 --> 01:04:09,240
Let's go relax.

1036
01:04:09,323 --> 01:04:10,241
- Okay!
- Okay!

1037
01:04:10,824 --> 01:04:11,867
Let's go then.

1038
01:04:21,335 --> 01:04:22,753
I'm so happy.

1039
01:04:23,337 --> 01:04:24,505
What should we eat first?

1040
01:04:24,588 --> 01:04:26,006
That's a good question.

1041
01:04:30,886 --> 01:04:32,054
Head…

1042
01:04:33,389 --> 01:04:36,517
Manager!

1043
01:04:40,896 --> 01:04:42,189
Be quiet.

1044
01:04:42,273 --> 01:04:43,399
- Who is he?
- Someone he knows?

1045
01:04:43,482 --> 01:04:44,316
Why are you here?

1046
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,026
This is a trip
for King Group's best employees.

1047
01:04:46,110 --> 01:04:47,236
I'm the best assistant.

1048
01:04:47,319 --> 01:04:50,864
I get what you're saying.
I'll send you on a trip next time. So go--

1049
01:04:50,948 --> 01:04:53,117
That's ridiculous. I need to assist you.

1050
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:54,743
Assist me with what?

1051
01:04:54,827 --> 01:04:56,537
- Just leave.
- Who are you?

1052
01:05:00,874 --> 01:05:03,168
- Hi, Sa-rang.
- Hello.

1053
01:05:04,211 --> 01:05:06,213
-It is an honor to finally meet
-He works at the hotel.

1054
01:05:06,297 --> 01:05:07,464
the people who were on the papers.

1055
01:05:07,548 --> 01:05:09,174
Let me introduce myself. I'm--

1056
01:05:09,258 --> 01:05:10,217
He is

1057
01:05:11,802 --> 01:05:13,929
the man behind this incentive trip,

1058
01:05:14,013 --> 01:05:15,639
Department Manager Yoo Sang-sik.

1059
01:05:19,018 --> 01:05:20,602
What are you talking about?

1060
01:05:23,647 --> 01:05:25,649
Let's introduce ourselves again.

1061
01:05:25,733 --> 01:05:28,777
This is Mr. Yoo Sang-sik.
He's a department manager.

1062
01:05:30,446 --> 01:05:31,405
And I'm

1063
01:05:31,989 --> 01:05:32,990
Mr. No.

1064
01:05:33,073 --> 01:05:35,159
Thank you, Mr. Yoo.

1065
01:05:35,242 --> 01:05:37,036
Mr. Yoo, thank you.

1066
01:05:37,119 --> 01:05:38,579
Mr. Yoo Sang-sik,

1067
01:05:38,662 --> 01:05:39,955
thank you.

1068
01:05:41,081 --> 01:05:42,333
Mr. Yoo,

1069
01:05:43,083 --> 01:05:45,627
I will guide them from start to finish,

1070
01:05:46,545 --> 01:05:48,130
- so you may…
- Will you move, Mr. No?

1071
01:05:48,213 --> 01:05:49,089
- What?
- "What?"

1072
01:05:49,173 --> 01:05:50,299
- Pardon?
- Yes, "pardon."

1073
01:05:50,382 --> 01:05:51,675
I'm a department manager.
You're just a manager.

1074
01:05:51,759 --> 01:05:53,093
So can you go over there?

1075
01:05:54,094 --> 01:05:56,055
Let me introduce myself again properly.

1076
01:05:56,138 --> 01:05:58,724
I am the department manager
in charge of this trip,

1077
01:05:58,807 --> 01:06:00,559
No… I mean, Yoo Sang-sik.

1078
01:06:00,642 --> 01:06:01,769
It's nice to meet you.

1079
01:06:05,689 --> 01:06:08,108
The concept of this trip is "We go hard."

1080
01:06:08,776 --> 01:06:10,319
When we eat, go hard.

1081
01:06:10,402 --> 01:06:12,029
When we have fun, go hard.

1082
01:06:12,112 --> 01:06:13,906
- All together…
- We go hard!

1083
01:06:13,989 --> 01:06:14,865
You're so energetic.

1084
01:06:16,450 --> 01:06:19,411
But Mr. No,
why do you have your mouth shut?

1085
01:06:25,084 --> 01:06:27,086
Just act like I'm not here, please.

1086
01:06:27,169 --> 01:06:28,879
Unity is key for this trip.

1087
01:06:28,962 --> 01:06:30,672
Individual activities are not allowed.

1088
01:06:30,756 --> 01:06:33,175
We'll set off after shouting our chant.

1089
01:06:33,801 --> 01:06:35,594
- When we eat…
- Go hard!

1090
01:06:35,677 --> 01:06:37,429
- When we have fun…
- Go hard!

1091
01:06:37,513 --> 01:06:39,306
- All together, we go hard!
- We go hard!

1092
01:06:39,390 --> 01:06:41,350
Okay. Let's go!

1093
01:06:52,069 --> 01:06:53,320
Why aren't you coming?

1094
01:06:53,404 --> 01:06:56,615
I'm not letting Mr. No get away with this.

1095
01:06:56,698 --> 01:06:58,033
I thought he was Mr. Yoo.

1096
01:06:58,992 --> 01:07:00,661
His enthusiasm is nice. Let's go.

1097
01:07:03,831 --> 01:07:04,873
Mr. No!

1098
01:07:05,416 --> 01:07:07,668
- Hurry up!
- Hurry up!

1099
01:07:07,751 --> 01:07:09,378
Okay. Coming.

1100
01:07:10,045 --> 01:07:10,963
I'm coming.

1101
01:07:11,046 --> 01:07:13,132
Mr. No, let's go!

1102
01:07:14,133 --> 01:07:17,261
Mr. No, let's go!

1103
01:07:28,564 --> 01:07:31,567

1108

<i>What about free time?</i>

1109
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:11,440
<i>There's no free time on a group tour.</i>

1110

<i>A trip?</i>

1113
01:08:17,321 --> 01:08:20,240
<i>How could something in King Group
be carried out without my knowledge?</i>

1114
01:08:20,324 --> 01:08:22,993
<i>But I keep wanting more.</i>

1115
01:08:23,076 --> 01:08:26,663
<i>I feel so happy that I begin to wonder
if I'm allowed this much happiness.</i>

1116
01:08:26,747 --> 01:08:30,959
<i>I keep hoping that
I'll continue to be this happy.</i>

1117

<i>I'll make every day of yours
filled with happiness.</i>
