KING THE LAND

KING THE LAND

00:00:12,193 --> 00:00:13,806
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

00:00:13,887 --> 00:00:15,626
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,366
RESUME

6
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:25,534
Is this you?

7
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:29,371
I put on a little weight.

8
00:00:29,455 --> 00:00:31,540
I don't need a high salary.

9
00:00:31,624 --> 00:00:34,126
I hope I don't have to stand all day.
I have flat feet.

10
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,544
- Excuse--
- Where do we eat?

11
00:00:35,628 --> 00:00:38,923
Communication is key
for a hotel concierge.

12
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:40,424
- Will you be able to communicate…
- Don't worry.

13
00:00:40,508 --> 00:00:42,009
I'm super fluent in Korean.

14
00:00:42,093 --> 00:00:44,845
I majored in political science
and international relations.

15
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:46,263
I will lead the conversations

16
00:00:47,056 --> 00:00:48,474
from the guests' perspectives…

17
00:00:49,892 --> 00:00:51,435
I'm shy. Please don't look at me.

18
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,396
Excuse me…

19
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,648
2015 KING HOTEL TRAINEESHIP INTERVIEW

20
00:01:06,242 --> 00:01:08,536
Number 511, please come in.

21
00:01:30,474 --> 00:01:32,393
What's with Number 511?

22
00:01:32,476 --> 00:01:34,270
Don't we require a bachelor's degree?

23
00:01:34,353 --> 00:01:35,229
I apologize.

24
00:01:35,312 --> 00:01:37,857
There must've been a mistake
during the resume screening process.

25
00:01:47,283 --> 00:01:48,993
Hello, I am interviewee number 511,

26
00:01:49,076 --> 00:01:50,244
Cheon Sa-rang.

27
00:01:51,537 --> 00:01:54,832
2015 KING HOTEL TRAINEESHIP INTERVIEW

28
00:02:12,474 --> 00:02:13,851
Your hobby is playing the piano.

29
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:15,644
Can you play for us?

30
00:02:16,145 --> 00:02:17,563
- Right now?
- Yes, right now.

31
00:02:20,316 --> 00:02:21,901
But there's no piano here.

32
00:02:21,984 --> 00:02:23,277
I know, right?

33
00:02:42,588 --> 00:02:44,006
INTERVIEWER

34
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:49,637
INTERVIEWER

35
00:03:00,773 --> 00:03:02,232
Your hobby is playing the piano,

36
00:03:03,025 --> 00:03:04,401
yet you played "Chopsticks."

37
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,946
It's my hobby, not my specialty.

38
00:03:07,029 --> 00:03:08,989
I'm not that good, but I enjoy playing.

39
00:03:11,784 --> 00:03:12,993
Can you smile for us?

40
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:31,220
Hey.

41
00:03:34,682 --> 00:03:35,933
You really did that?

42
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:38,018
Yes. What else was I supposed to do?

43
00:03:38,102 --> 00:03:40,187
But still, it was King Hotel.

44
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:42,481
You should've at least
played something by Beethoven.

45
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:48,195
Wonderful.

46
00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:49,446
You pass.

47
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,366
Thank you, ma'am. I'll work hard.

48
00:03:52,992 --> 00:03:56,203
Hey, Beethoven or Mozart.
None of that matters.

49
00:03:56,287 --> 00:03:59,456
They require bachelor's degrees
from mere one-month trainees.

50
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,792
Then why did you go for the interview?

51
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:02,835
Just because.

52
00:04:02,918 --> 00:04:05,254
I wondered how Korea's best hotel
conducted their interviews.

53
00:04:05,337 --> 00:04:08,257
If you've satisfied your curiosity,
join me at the duty-free shop.

54
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,759
Don't listen to her.
Be a flight attendant with me.

55
00:04:11,468 --> 00:04:14,013
No, I'm going to work in a hotel.

56
00:04:14,096 --> 00:04:15,597
Come on. Why?

57
00:04:15,681 --> 00:04:16,932
I just like hotels.

58
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:19,935
More than you like me?

59
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,063
Hey, you like nightclubs
more than you like me.

60
00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:26,317
How upsetting.

61
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,943
How could you say that?

62
00:04:28,027 --> 00:04:29,069
It can't be helped.

63
00:04:29,987 --> 00:04:31,071
Let's go clubbing.

64
00:04:31,822 --> 00:04:32,823
Right now?

65
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:34,116
Let's go where?

66
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,452
- Let's go!
- What are you talking about?

67
00:04:37,202 --> 00:04:38,162
Excuse me.

68
00:04:38,871 --> 00:04:40,539
I've been watching you for a while.

69
00:04:40,622 --> 00:04:42,207
Would you care for a drink?

70
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:54,970
I'm sorry.

71
00:04:55,054 --> 00:04:57,890
We were in the middle
of something important.

72
00:04:59,183 --> 00:05:00,851
You can just give me your number.

73
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:03,312
Hey.

74
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:09,610
There we go.

75
00:05:11,153 --> 00:05:12,446
I'll get in touch with you.

76
00:05:16,075 --> 00:05:18,327
Hey, why would you
give your number to a stranger?

77
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,788
What do you mean by "stranger"?
We're acquainted now.

78
00:05:20,871 --> 00:05:23,499
Didn't I tell you to start a relationship
after you developed feelings

79
00:05:23,582 --> 00:05:24,875
instead of regretting it later?

80
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,211
Hey, love doesn't happen in stages.

81
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:28,796
I'm dying to know

82
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:31,048
who you'll get married to
with that mindset.

83
00:05:31,715 --> 00:05:32,674
Are you crazy?

84
00:05:32,758 --> 00:05:35,385
Why would I settle with one person
for the rest of my life?

85
00:05:36,345 --> 00:05:38,263
Even the thought is frightening. Let's go.

86
00:05:38,347 --> 00:05:39,223
Let's go.

87
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:42,476
I'll pass. I'm so tired.

88
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:44,478
- That's why you go clubbing.
- I mean…

89
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:48,023
You just got off your flight.
You should get some rest.

90
00:05:48,107 --> 00:05:50,109
No sleep at all is better
than just a few hours.

91
00:05:50,192 --> 00:05:51,026
Grab her.

92
00:05:52,111 --> 00:05:54,780
- I'm not in the mood today.
- Goodness.

93
00:05:54,863 --> 00:05:56,198
I'm feeling pumped already.

94
00:07:05,532 --> 00:07:06,574
Who is it?

95
00:07:10,328 --> 00:07:11,371
Hello?

96
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:16,459
Yes, I'm Number 511, Cheon Sa-rang.

97
00:07:19,504 --> 00:07:20,422
Sorry?

98
00:07:21,131 --> 00:07:22,215
Really?

99
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:25,218
I did?

100
00:07:25,301 --> 00:07:26,344
But why?

101
00:07:27,887 --> 00:07:29,973
No, that's not what I meant.

102
00:07:30,056 --> 00:07:32,851
Okay, thank you.

103
00:07:45,071 --> 00:07:46,865
Why? What's wrong?

104
00:07:46,948 --> 00:07:47,907
What's the matter?

105
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:49,075
I passed.

106
00:07:51,745 --> 00:07:54,247
I got an offer from King Hotel!

107
00:07:57,459 --> 00:07:58,877
Congratulations, Sa-rang!

108
00:09:53,575 --> 00:09:55,743
- Hello?
- <i>You landed in the wrong place.</i>

109
00:09:56,494 --> 00:09:59,080
- Sorry?
- <i>It's the building next to you.</i>

110
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,837
Over here!

111
00:10:06,504 --> 00:10:08,715
Over here!

112
00:10:09,424 --> 00:10:11,467
Over here!

113
00:10:12,051 --> 00:10:13,428
Over here!

114
00:10:15,305 --> 00:10:17,682
EPISODE 1

115
00:10:22,896 --> 00:10:24,814
The most important quality of an intern

116
00:10:24,898 --> 00:10:27,400
is not how good they are at their job.

117
00:10:27,483 --> 00:10:28,902
It's having common sense.

118
00:10:29,611 --> 00:10:32,697
No matter how nimble you are
or how hard you work,

119
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,991
it's over for you
if people find you thoughtless.

120
00:10:35,074 --> 00:10:35,909
The end.

121
00:10:35,992 --> 00:10:38,912
Consider arriving late
on your first day of work

122
00:10:38,995 --> 00:10:41,748
and saying, "I thought it was
the building next door."

123
00:10:41,831 --> 00:10:43,541
What ridiculous excuse is that?

124
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:44,751
What are you…

125
00:10:45,585 --> 00:10:47,420
Where did you buy your shoes?

126
00:10:49,964 --> 00:10:51,215
I bought them in Milan.

127
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:52,258
Milan?

128
00:10:53,885 --> 00:10:55,887
A three-piece suit and shoes from Milan.

129
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,722
You could be mistaken for a nobleman.

130
00:10:57,805 --> 00:10:59,557
- You should laugh along.
- Yes, sir.

131
00:10:59,641 --> 00:11:02,518
You need to laugh now
if you want to be seen as mindful.

132
00:11:02,602 --> 00:11:06,022
All right. Starting now,
I'll teach you what it means to have…

133
00:11:06,689 --> 00:11:08,399
This is fake, isn't it?

134
00:11:08,483 --> 00:11:09,484
No.

135
00:11:09,567 --> 00:11:10,818
It's authentic?

136
00:11:10,902 --> 00:11:13,613
Look at you. Goodness. Hold on.

137
00:11:18,868 --> 00:11:21,454
How much does your outfit cost?

138
00:11:21,537 --> 00:11:22,580
Are you a chaebol?

139
00:11:23,456 --> 00:11:24,499
Well…

140
00:11:26,042 --> 00:11:27,794
- No.
- See? I knew it.

141
00:11:27,877 --> 00:11:28,753
Look at you.

142
00:11:28,836 --> 00:11:30,338
He's acting like one.

143
00:11:30,421 --> 00:11:32,924
You're on the path of self-destruction.

144
00:11:33,007 --> 00:11:35,093
This is what you call being thoughtless.

145
00:11:35,176 --> 00:11:36,386
While you're in my charge,

146
00:11:36,469 --> 00:11:38,680
don't think of doing anything
and just follow my orders.

147
00:11:38,763 --> 00:11:40,598
- Yes, sir.
- Louder. Got it?

148
00:11:40,682 --> 00:11:42,100
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

149
00:11:42,183 --> 00:11:43,267
SALES SUPPORT TEAM
INTERN GU WON

150
00:11:51,401 --> 00:11:52,652
This is your first internship, right?

151
00:11:52,735 --> 00:11:53,861
Don't be late tomorrow.

152
00:11:53,945 --> 00:11:55,279
I wasn't late.

153
00:11:56,072 --> 00:11:58,491
If you come to work on the dot,
it means you're late.

154
00:11:58,574 --> 00:12:00,868
Come to work
at least 30 minutes early. Got it?

155
00:12:02,495 --> 00:12:04,747
But why are you speaking so casually?

156
00:12:04,831 --> 00:12:06,499
Because we're coworkers.

157
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,627
We have to get through
this unfriendly world together.

158
00:12:10,211 --> 00:12:12,338
Don't just sit there.
Uncross your legs and do something.

159
00:12:12,422 --> 00:12:14,841
Do what? There's nothing to do.

160
00:12:15,341 --> 00:12:17,593
You still have to act
like you're doing something.

161
00:12:17,677 --> 00:12:20,805
Here. I'll give you a calculator,
so press some buttons.

162
00:12:20,888 --> 00:12:22,098
I said uncross your legs.

163
00:12:22,181 --> 00:12:23,433
And you heard him earlier, right?

164
00:12:23,516 --> 00:12:25,560
You shouldn't wear
expensive suits or watches.

165
00:12:25,643 --> 00:12:27,520
Wear something old like mine if you must.

166
00:12:27,603 --> 00:12:29,647
Do I have to? Why?

167
00:12:30,231 --> 00:12:33,276
Wearing something more expensive
than your superiors is considered mutiny.

168
00:12:33,359 --> 00:12:35,069
You can flaunt your money outside of work.

169
00:12:35,153 --> 00:12:36,446
I never flaunted it.

170
00:12:36,529 --> 00:12:38,614
My goodness. You're absolutely clueless.

171
00:12:39,741 --> 00:12:42,201
One would think
you were parachuted into the job.

172
00:12:43,536 --> 00:12:44,495
You're right.

173
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:46,205
I parachuted here.

174
00:12:46,956 --> 00:12:47,832
What?

175
00:12:47,915 --> 00:12:50,126
I had to rush in from Jeju Island.

176
00:12:51,043 --> 00:12:52,211
Is there something wrong?

177
00:12:53,004 --> 00:12:54,130
You're driving me crazy.

178
00:12:57,049 --> 00:12:58,092
Listen carefully.

179
00:12:58,801 --> 00:13:00,511
This is my fifth internship.

180
00:13:00,595 --> 00:13:01,929
If you keep acting like this,

181
00:13:02,013 --> 00:13:05,808
you won't even be able to land a job
as a contract worker. Get it together.

182
00:13:05,892 --> 00:13:08,019
- Interns!
- Yes, sir. No Sang-sik reporting.

183
00:13:08,102 --> 00:13:10,104
- Interns.
- Yes, No Sang-sik here.

184
00:13:10,188 --> 00:13:11,272
Why did you come alone?

185
00:13:11,355 --> 00:13:12,857
- Did we only hire one intern?
- No, sir.

186
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,567
I thought you were just calling me.

187
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:16,277
Where are you going? Just call him.

188
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,112
- Right.
- What are you doing?

189
00:13:24,702 --> 00:13:26,621
What? What is he doing?

190
00:13:26,704 --> 00:13:28,498
He needs to sit when he works, you see.

191
00:13:28,581 --> 00:13:30,666
Goodness. He got up.

192
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,084
Look at how relaxed he is.

193
00:13:32,168 --> 00:13:34,462
How cool. I thought you were the chairman.

194
00:13:35,046 --> 00:13:37,256
It's because this is his first internship.

195
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,591
I'll help him out.

196
00:13:38,674 --> 00:13:40,468
- Yes, please help me out too.
- Yes, sir.

197
00:13:40,551 --> 00:13:41,594
- To general affairs.
- Yes, sir.

198
00:13:41,677 --> 00:13:43,763
And make three copies of each.

199
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,308
Take your hand out of your pocket.

200
00:13:48,184 --> 00:13:49,977
Make copies. Yes, sir. Here.

201
00:13:50,061 --> 00:13:51,771
Go.

202
00:13:51,854 --> 00:13:54,774
HOW TO USE A COPIER

203
00:13:59,737 --> 00:14:01,489
You're still not done?

204
00:14:01,989 --> 00:14:04,492
I didn't know how to use this,
so I was looking it up.

205
00:14:04,575 --> 00:14:06,035
How could you not know that?

206
00:14:06,953 --> 00:14:08,412
Since I've never used it before.

207
00:14:08,496 --> 00:14:10,039
Are you a young master or what?

208
00:14:10,123 --> 00:14:12,416
Have your servants
been doing these chores for you?

209
00:14:13,668 --> 00:14:16,003
Also, this is the scanner. Don't use this.

210
00:14:16,087 --> 00:14:18,047
Look. Just press this button.

211
00:14:18,131 --> 00:14:19,924
We have to replace the toner cartridge.

212
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:23,052
- Interns, what are you doing here?
- Yes, sir?

213
00:14:23,136 --> 00:14:25,638
It says we need to
replace the toner cartridge.

214
00:14:25,721 --> 00:14:28,432
Gosh, we asked for a new machine ages ago.

215
00:14:28,516 --> 00:14:30,518
The machine has a sensor issue.
Just give it a shake.

216
00:14:30,601 --> 00:14:31,936
- Shake it?
- Yes, shake it.

217
00:14:32,436 --> 00:14:33,437
Yes, sir.

218
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:35,815
How cute. Are you going to be that gentle?

219
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,442
- Shake vigorously.
- What if it explodes?

220
00:14:38,526 --> 00:14:40,486
- I said, shake it vigorously.
- Yes, sir.

221
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,029
- That's it. Good job.
- Yes, sir.

222
00:14:42,113 --> 00:14:43,030
- More.
- Yes, sir.

223
00:14:43,114 --> 00:14:45,700
- More.
- More.

224
00:14:45,783 --> 00:14:48,870
- More.
- More.

225
00:15:06,721 --> 00:15:09,265
Darn it. Who messed with the copier?

226
00:15:11,225 --> 00:15:13,477
My goodness. I can't believe you guys.

227
00:15:13,561 --> 00:15:15,313
You're driving me insane.

228
00:15:15,396 --> 00:15:16,647
- Who was it?
- Darn it.

229
00:15:18,858 --> 00:15:20,484
I'm sorry.

230
00:15:20,568 --> 00:15:21,777
I was told to shake it so…

231
00:15:21,861 --> 00:15:23,863
That's not even that expensive.

232
00:15:23,946 --> 00:15:26,157
You could've just gotten a new one.

233
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,576
Are we living in the '80s?
Why would you shake that?

234
00:15:28,659 --> 00:15:30,411
Well, the thing is…

235
00:15:30,494 --> 00:15:33,623
You have a lot to say
after causing trouble. Just be quiet.

236
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,541
I'm sorry.

237
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:38,085
Why did they hire a blockhead like you?

238
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,463
- Clean the mess!
- Yes, sir.

239
00:15:41,005 --> 00:15:42,924
Why are you sorry?
You didn't do anything wrong.

240
00:15:44,175 --> 00:15:45,301
Of course I'm at fault.

241
00:15:45,384 --> 00:15:47,386
- It's all my fault. Why…
- How so?

242
00:15:48,888 --> 00:15:50,014
Hey.

243
00:15:50,097 --> 00:15:52,183
What did you just say?

244
00:15:52,892 --> 00:15:55,102
I said it wasn't
Intern No Sang-sik's fault.

245
00:15:55,186 --> 00:15:56,062
Why not?

246
00:15:56,145 --> 00:15:59,232
He just followed orders
because he was told to.

247
00:15:59,315 --> 00:16:01,108
If it resulted in a negative outcome,

248
00:16:02,026 --> 00:16:04,153
isn't the person
who gave the order at fault?

249
00:16:05,071 --> 00:16:06,239
Stop it.

250
00:16:06,948 --> 00:16:08,449
- What?
- I believe it's not right

251
00:16:08,532 --> 00:16:10,868
to blame your juniors
without determining the cause.

252
00:16:10,952 --> 00:16:13,037
Also, this only happened

253
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,748
because the copier was not replaced
when it should've been.

254
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,793
So the company is most at fault.

255
00:16:18,876 --> 00:16:21,128
How dare an intern criticize the company?

256
00:16:21,212 --> 00:16:23,965
Even a mere intern
can tell right from wrong.

257
00:16:24,048 --> 00:16:25,925
- Darn you.
- I'm sorry.

258
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:29,136
This punk has no sense in him.

259
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,348
Clean up this mess at once and get lost.

260
00:16:32,431 --> 00:16:34,433
And don't come to work starting tomorrow.

261
00:16:35,017 --> 00:16:36,519
No, I have to come to work.

262
00:16:36,602 --> 00:16:37,645
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

263
00:16:38,479 --> 00:16:39,981
- I'll do that.
- What?

264
00:16:40,064 --> 00:16:41,023
You'll what?

265
00:16:41,107 --> 00:16:42,191
Don't move! Where are you going?

266
00:16:43,526 --> 00:16:45,736
- You said to clean up the mess.
- Yes, right here.

267
00:16:48,281 --> 00:16:49,323
Hello, it's me.

268
00:16:49,991 --> 00:16:52,576
Can you send some cleaners
to the sales support team?

269
00:16:53,953 --> 00:16:54,912
Yes.

270
00:16:54,996 --> 00:16:56,998
The copier also needs to be replaced.

271
00:16:57,081 --> 00:16:58,082
All right.

272
00:16:59,917 --> 00:17:01,752
- He said he'll send them.
- Who?

273
00:17:02,336 --> 00:17:03,296
The cleaners.

274
00:17:03,379 --> 00:17:04,297
Who said that?

275
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,257
- Director Choi.
- Director Choi?

276
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,466
By Director Choi…

277
00:17:08,801 --> 00:17:11,053
The only Director Choi here

278
00:17:11,137 --> 00:17:15,016
is the one who works
in the chairman's secretary's office.

279
00:17:15,891 --> 00:17:16,767
That's right.

280
00:17:18,144 --> 00:17:20,896
If you don't mind me asking, who are you?

281
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,651
I'm an intern,

282
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,070
and my name is Gu Won.

283
00:17:30,364 --> 00:17:32,199
Gu Won?

284
00:17:32,283 --> 00:17:34,827
Then are you Chairman Gu Il-hun's…

285
00:17:36,162 --> 00:17:37,121
That's right.

286
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:39,790
Goodness.

287
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,918
Goodness, you look amazing in this suit.

288
00:17:43,002 --> 00:17:44,420
Then I guess

289
00:17:44,503 --> 00:17:47,131
I won't come to work
starting tomorrow as you ordered.

290
00:17:47,214 --> 00:17:49,258
No, ignore what I said. I'm sorry.

291
00:17:49,342 --> 00:17:51,218
Don't apologize. I'm a mere intern.

292
00:17:51,302 --> 00:17:53,179
I just need to do as I'm told.

293
00:17:54,472 --> 00:17:56,307
Excuse me, Mr. Choi.

294
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:57,933
Choi Tae-man at your service.

295
00:17:58,017 --> 00:17:59,393
Thanks to you,

296
00:18:00,227 --> 00:18:02,521
I now have a good grasp of
what thoughtlessness is.

297
00:18:02,605 --> 00:18:03,773
I'll be born again.

298
00:18:04,315 --> 00:18:05,691
Hello, Mr. Choi.

299
00:18:05,775 --> 00:18:07,109
What's wrong with the copier?

300
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,570
Are you hurt anywhere?

301
00:18:09,653 --> 00:18:12,698
I'm fine. Please just handle the mess.

302
00:18:12,782 --> 00:18:13,741
Hold on.

303
00:18:14,492 --> 00:18:16,577
I was told to
manage your attendance strictly.

304
00:18:17,161 --> 00:18:19,747
If you leave now,
the chairman will be furious.

305
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,082
I just…

306
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:23,417
got fired.

307
00:18:23,501 --> 00:18:25,586
- No, it was a joke.
- I'm leaving.

308
00:18:27,463 --> 00:18:28,464
Won.

309
00:18:29,298 --> 00:18:30,341
You come over here.

310
00:18:30,424 --> 00:18:31,509
- It's all your fault!
- I'm sorry.

311
00:18:31,592 --> 00:18:33,677
- Why did you have to shake that?
- I'm sorry.

312
00:18:33,761 --> 00:18:35,346
I can't get fired though.

313
00:18:35,429 --> 00:18:36,889
- I need to stay here.
- I can't believe this.

314
00:18:36,972 --> 00:18:39,975
I didn't know
that shaking the cartridge would…

315
00:18:40,726 --> 00:18:41,852
You're back, sir.

316
00:18:42,728 --> 00:18:43,979
Do you want to go with me?

317
00:18:46,232 --> 00:18:48,067
- Me?
- As coworkers,

318
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:50,152
we need to get through
this unfriendly world together.

319
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,197
You said staying here won't even
guarantee you a contract position.

320
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,075
Come with me
and you'll get a full-time position.

321
00:19:02,873 --> 00:19:05,042
I will serve you
with my utmost sincerity, sir.

322
00:19:08,254 --> 00:19:09,797
- Do I need to clean this?
- I'll take care of it.

323
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,798
- Okay, then.
- Sure.

324
00:19:10,881 --> 00:19:12,550
- Here you go.
- You may give it to me.

325
00:19:12,633 --> 00:19:14,468
- I hope you'll be born again.
- Thank you.

326
00:19:14,552 --> 00:19:16,595
Let's go, sir.

327
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:19,473
Coming through. Please make way.

328
00:19:19,557 --> 00:19:21,892
- Gosh, why did you…
- <i>Are you in your right mind?!</i>

329
00:19:22,726 --> 00:19:24,520
I told you to learn from the bottom up.

330
00:19:24,603 --> 00:19:25,980
And you left on the first day?

331
00:19:26,689 --> 00:19:29,108
I didn't choose to leave.
I got kicked out.

332
00:19:29,191 --> 00:19:31,610
Either way, I already told you
that I'm not cut out for this.

333
00:19:32,528 --> 00:19:33,571
I'll go back to the UK.

334
00:19:33,654 --> 00:19:35,030
- What will you do there?
- Dad.

335
00:19:35,114 --> 00:19:36,407
That's enough.

336
00:19:37,241 --> 00:19:39,910
He can start slowly after studying more.

337
00:19:39,994 --> 00:19:42,413
And I know it's good
to start from the bottom,

338
00:19:42,997 --> 00:19:44,165
but an intern was too much.

339
00:19:44,999 --> 00:19:46,375
Why can't you be
half as good as your sister?

340
00:19:47,168 --> 00:19:48,544
Who does he take after?

341
00:19:48,627 --> 00:19:51,255
Don't be too harsh on him.
I'll try talking to him.

342
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,550
Can we talk?

343
00:19:58,137 --> 00:19:59,472
Go to the hotel.

344
00:19:59,555 --> 00:20:00,973
It's a hassle.

345
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,892
I'll stay here tonight.

346
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,603
Who are you to stay here?

347
00:20:09,773 --> 00:20:10,900
Don't be mistaken.

348
00:20:10,983 --> 00:20:12,401
This isn't your house.

349
00:20:16,489 --> 00:20:17,573
You're right.

350
00:20:17,656 --> 00:20:19,408
I forgot for a second.

351
00:20:19,992 --> 00:20:22,077
Stay at the hotel
and fly out as soon as possible.

352
00:20:22,661 --> 00:20:24,163
Whatever you choose to do,

353
00:20:24,246 --> 00:20:25,789
I'll support you financially.

354
00:20:26,457 --> 00:20:29,418
So don't even think about
lurking around the house or the company.

355
00:20:35,883 --> 00:20:36,842
You know,

356
00:20:37,843 --> 00:20:38,844
I'm loaded too.

357
00:20:41,889 --> 00:20:43,974
But thanks for looking after me.

358
00:20:45,518 --> 00:20:47,394
You almost moved me for a second.

359
00:21:02,576 --> 00:21:03,494
Where's Won?

360
00:21:03,577 --> 00:21:05,746
He said he'd stay at the hotel
for the time being.

361
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,374
I insisted that he should at least eat.

362
00:21:10,918 --> 00:21:11,919
That imbecile.

363
00:21:12,545 --> 00:21:15,172
That wasn't even an earful,
but he ran away without eating.

364
00:21:15,256 --> 00:21:16,799
He still has a long way to go.

365
00:21:16,882 --> 00:21:19,593
If you keep tugging,
he'll only run farther away.

366
00:21:20,511 --> 00:21:22,555
Letting him be
might be a good option for now.

367
00:21:24,348 --> 00:21:25,307
All right.

368
00:21:26,016 --> 00:21:29,061
Make sure you don't
give him a hard time either.

369
00:23:27,596 --> 00:23:28,972
The guest is what?

370
00:23:29,056 --> 00:23:30,599
- The guest is king.
- The guest is king.

371
00:23:30,682 --> 00:23:32,935
That's right. The guest is king.

372
00:23:33,018 --> 00:23:33,936
Why?

373
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:36,522
Because guests pay
service charges at hotels.

374
00:23:36,605 --> 00:23:39,858
Because of that, it is our duty
to treat our guests like the king,

375
00:23:39,942 --> 00:23:42,986
and it gives them the right
to be treated like one as well.

376
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:45,155
We aim to provide the guests
with satisfactory service

377
00:23:45,239 --> 00:23:47,533
as well as to move their hearts.

378
00:23:47,616 --> 00:23:51,078
We have to forget about our emotions
for the sake of our guests.

379
00:23:51,787 --> 00:23:54,081
If you feel you're not up to it,
you may leave now.

380
00:23:57,334 --> 00:23:58,252
No one?

381
00:23:58,335 --> 00:24:00,212
Are you all ready to serve the king?

382
00:24:00,295 --> 00:24:01,171
- Yes.
- Yes.

383
00:24:01,255 --> 00:24:03,507
Quality customer service
starts with a smile.

384
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:06,677
This is the high-end smile
that only King Hotel offers.

385
00:24:07,261 --> 00:24:08,470
Hermès!

386
00:24:08,554 --> 00:24:09,930
- Hermès!
- Hermès!

387
00:24:10,013 --> 00:24:13,392
A smile is the greatest sword and shield.

388
00:24:13,475 --> 00:24:15,853
Beautifully, Hermès!

389
00:24:16,437 --> 00:24:17,855
- Hermès!
- Hermès!

390
00:24:24,486 --> 00:24:25,988
Hello, Manager Kim.

391
00:24:26,071 --> 00:24:27,531
What's wrong with the floor?

392
00:24:27,614 --> 00:24:28,782
We just cleaned it.

393
00:24:28,866 --> 00:24:31,201
Clean it again and again
until it's sparkling clean.

394
00:24:31,827 --> 00:24:33,120
She's a trainee.

395
00:24:33,203 --> 00:24:35,372
Hello, I'm Cheon Sa-rang.

396
00:24:35,456 --> 00:24:36,582
I'll take a look around.

397
00:24:36,665 --> 00:24:39,001
- Teach her from A to Z.
- Yes, ma'am.

398
00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:47,551
You're uselessly pretty
for a one-month trainee.

399
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,929
- Pardon?
- You'll be gone in a month.

400
00:24:51,013 --> 00:24:52,306
Go and wipe the butt sweat.

401
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,099
"Butt sweat"?

402
00:24:54,683 --> 00:24:55,934
If you go over there,

403
00:24:56,018 --> 00:24:58,896
you'll see the beautiful butt sweat
left by our guests.

404
00:24:58,979 --> 00:25:00,856
You'll be in charge of that for a month,

405
00:25:00,939 --> 00:25:03,525
so don't miss a single drop
and wipe until it's sparkling clean.

406
00:25:04,109 --> 00:25:04,985
Yes, ma'am.

407
00:25:15,078 --> 00:25:16,246
Hey you.

408
00:25:16,914 --> 00:25:17,831
Hermès!

409
00:25:18,749 --> 00:25:19,666
Hermès!

410
00:25:30,469 --> 00:25:32,262
Hermès.

411
00:25:32,888 --> 00:25:34,014
Hermès.

412
00:25:37,059 --> 00:25:39,686
Cotton swabs and cotton pads
should be filled to 90%.

413
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:41,563
It's difficult to take one out at 100%.

414
00:25:41,647 --> 00:25:44,024
Anything under 90%
makes it look like we don't care.

415
00:25:44,775 --> 00:25:46,068
Yes, ma'am.

416
00:25:47,027 --> 00:25:49,112
Why are you so smiley?

417
00:25:49,196 --> 00:25:52,032
I was taught to maintain
my Hermès smile while working.

418
00:25:52,115 --> 00:25:53,575
That applies to concierges.

419
00:25:53,659 --> 00:25:55,244
We still work in the hotel.

420
00:25:55,327 --> 00:25:57,746
The true hotel working experience
starts in the lobby.

421
00:25:57,829 --> 00:26:00,249
We wear sportswear
while they wear uniforms.

422
00:26:00,791 --> 00:26:04,127
Plus, you're only here for a month.
You don't need to get used to Hermès.

423
00:26:05,045 --> 00:26:07,172
I should still try my best while I'm here.

424
00:26:07,256 --> 00:26:08,298
Try all you want.

425
00:26:08,382 --> 00:26:11,343
No matter what happens,
you won't be able to go near the lobby.

426
00:26:11,426 --> 00:26:14,513
Even I've been stuck here for five years.

427
00:26:14,596 --> 00:26:16,431
At least you're a full-time worker.

428
00:26:19,017 --> 00:26:20,060
Well…

429
00:26:20,852 --> 00:26:22,604
I'm better than you in every aspect.

430
00:26:23,397 --> 00:26:27,234
If you're done here, go out and wipe
until everything's sparkling clean.

431
00:26:27,317 --> 00:26:30,028
Okay. I'll wipe
until everything's sparkling clean.

432
00:26:33,156 --> 00:26:36,118
Let's get up early tomorrow
so we can eat something before our flight.

433
00:26:36,201 --> 00:26:39,329
Pyeong-hwa, look up some famous places
nearby and make a reservation.

434
00:26:39,413 --> 00:26:41,164
We have the hotel breakfast reserved.

435
00:26:41,248 --> 00:26:42,374
I asked for a famous restaurant.

436
00:26:42,457 --> 00:26:44,167
Find a rare restaurant with food

437
00:26:44,251 --> 00:26:45,586
that is unique to this place.

438
00:26:45,669 --> 00:26:49,089
Yes, ma'am.
I will look for a rare restaurant.

439
00:26:49,172 --> 00:26:50,549
We're checked in.

440
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:54,428
Who wants to share a room with me?

441
00:26:58,515 --> 00:26:59,766
Then should I choose?

442
00:27:01,101 --> 00:27:05,731
<i>Who will share a room with me?</i>

443
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,986
<i>I wonder who it will be</i>

444
00:27:11,653 --> 00:27:13,488
<i>Eeny, meeny, miny…</i>

445
00:27:16,325 --> 00:27:17,326
<i>moe!</i>

446
00:27:17,868 --> 00:27:18,994
You win!

447
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:27,753
Be done in ten minutes.

448
00:27:27,836 --> 00:27:29,504
Don't use the restroom while I'm sleeping.

449
00:27:29,588 --> 00:27:31,006
- Yes, ma'am.
- Unplug all the TV

450
00:27:31,089 --> 00:27:32,132
and fridge cables.

451
00:27:32,215 --> 00:27:34,176
I can't sleep if it's noisy. Understood?

452
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,969
Yes, ma'am. I…

453
00:27:38,513 --> 00:27:41,642
RARE RESTAURANTS IN JEJU ISLAND

454
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:45,854
Didn't I tell you that I'm sensitive?

455
00:27:45,937 --> 00:27:47,856
I could sense the electromagnetic waves.

456
00:27:48,649 --> 00:27:49,650
I'm sorry.

457
00:27:49,733 --> 00:27:51,943
- Turn off your phone.
- I put it on silent.

458
00:27:52,027 --> 00:27:53,612
I can sense that too.

459
00:28:22,391 --> 00:28:25,060
Thank you. Please come again next time.

460
00:28:26,812 --> 00:28:28,480
- Da-eul.
- Yes?

461
00:28:28,563 --> 00:28:30,941
The manager said
she doesn't like the cafeteria menu.

462
00:28:31,024 --> 00:28:32,943
She wants some <i>gimbap</i> to eat in the back.

463
00:28:33,527 --> 00:28:35,028
All right. I'll be right back.

464
00:28:39,074 --> 00:28:40,951
Sorry. Coming through.

465
00:28:42,536 --> 00:28:44,079
One tuna, two beef,

466
00:28:44,162 --> 00:28:46,206
and one kimchi rice ball to go.

467
00:28:46,289 --> 00:28:48,000
Okay, I got your order.

468
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:52,004
I'm really sorry, but in the tuna <i>gimbap</i>,
could you please reduce the rice,

469
00:28:52,087 --> 00:28:53,755
add a lot of tuna and mayonnaise,

470
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:55,590
and take out the spinach?

471
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,843
Sure.

472
00:28:59,011 --> 00:29:02,347
I'm really sorry again,
but for one of the beef <i>gimbap</i>,

473
00:29:02,431 --> 00:29:05,183
can you leave out
the sesame oil and carrots?

474
00:29:06,018 --> 00:29:07,185
Why don't you make it yourself?

475
00:29:07,269 --> 00:29:10,022
I'm sorry. My seniors are picky eaters.

476
00:29:10,105 --> 00:29:12,274
Just for today. I can't cater to
your needs when I'm busy.

477
00:29:12,357 --> 00:29:13,650
Thank you so much.

478
00:29:14,443 --> 00:29:15,902
I'm really sorry again…

479
00:29:15,986 --> 00:29:17,863
- What now?
- Along with the other requests,

480
00:29:17,946 --> 00:29:19,948
for the other beef <i>gimbap</i>,
can you take out the eggs

481
00:29:20,032 --> 00:29:23,243
and apply the right amount of sesame oil
to make it give off a slight scent?

482
00:29:23,326 --> 00:29:25,620
- Get out. I'm done with you.
- I'm sorry.

483
00:29:25,704 --> 00:29:26,955
Please help me out.

484
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,999
- I need to buy the <i>gimbap</i>.
- Get out!

485
00:29:29,082 --> 00:29:30,208
I'll make them.

486
00:29:30,292 --> 00:29:32,836
At least allow me to make them. Please.

487
00:29:33,587 --> 00:29:35,630
Excuse me. Sorry.

488
00:29:40,844 --> 00:29:42,554
I'm back. I'll get everything ready.

489
00:29:43,138 --> 00:29:44,723
The manager went to the cafeteria.

490
00:29:44,806 --> 00:29:45,932
Sorry?

491
00:29:46,683 --> 00:29:47,642
What about these?

492
00:29:48,685 --> 00:29:51,605
Didn't you hear me? She wants
the pork cutlet from the cafeteria.

493
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:54,691
Let's go.

494
00:30:09,081 --> 00:30:10,290
Where's the water?

495
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:14,753
- Hello.
- Hello.

496
00:30:14,836 --> 00:30:16,338
- This is Alanga.
- This is King Hotel.

497
00:30:16,922 --> 00:30:18,131
- Over there.
- Yes, ma'am.

498
00:30:24,304 --> 00:30:26,056
Apologizing doesn't solve the problem!

499
00:30:27,057 --> 00:30:29,142
Welcome. May I check your boarding pass?

500
00:30:31,561 --> 00:30:32,604
Coming!

501
00:31:16,356 --> 00:31:17,482
I can't believe my eyes.

502
00:31:19,067 --> 00:31:20,610
Sir, I'm here.

503
00:31:23,446 --> 00:31:24,531
Next.

504
00:31:28,702 --> 00:31:30,412
Are you purchasing your clothes here?

505
00:31:31,204 --> 00:31:32,956
Why would I bother shopping in person?

506
00:31:33,874 --> 00:31:36,418
The comfort of the rich is beautiful.

507
00:31:37,794 --> 00:31:40,839
What do you think of this?
There are only three in the nation.

508
00:31:42,382 --> 00:31:43,258
Give me all three.

509
00:31:43,341 --> 00:31:46,136
I'm sorry, but one has already been sold.

510
00:31:46,219 --> 00:31:47,846
Then give me the remaining two.

511
00:31:48,555 --> 00:31:49,556
I'm okay.

512
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,892
Matching shirts seems a bit too much.

513
00:31:51,975 --> 00:31:53,602
I appreciate your gesture though.

514
00:31:53,685 --> 00:31:54,561
Matching shirts?

515
00:31:54,644 --> 00:31:55,562
Why would I?

516
00:31:56,146 --> 00:31:57,480
Weren't you going to give one to me?

517
00:31:57,564 --> 00:31:58,648
Both of them are mine.

518
00:31:59,357 --> 00:32:02,861
Also, I hate it when someone else wears
the same thing as me.

519
00:32:03,528 --> 00:32:05,030
Just go and get ready for the UK.

520
00:32:05,614 --> 00:32:06,823
We're leaving in a week.

521
00:32:06,907 --> 00:32:08,408
Be prepared not to come back.

522
00:32:08,992 --> 00:32:10,118
The UK all of a sudden?

523
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,204
I don't have a passport.

524
00:32:12,871 --> 00:32:14,956
Is that even possible?

525
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,249
Have you never been abroad?

526
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:18,293
I never had the opportunity to do so.

527
00:32:18,376 --> 00:32:20,003
I was busy interning.

528
00:32:20,086 --> 00:32:21,671
Apply for a passport this instant.

529
00:32:23,965 --> 00:32:26,927
By the way, sir,
will I really become a full-time employee?

530
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:30,180
What if I follow you
and end up hanging in the wind?

531
00:32:31,431 --> 00:32:32,390
Hello?

532
00:32:33,183 --> 00:32:34,267
It's me.

533
00:32:34,768 --> 00:32:37,270
Can you promote No Sang-sik
to a full-time position?

534
00:32:37,354 --> 00:32:38,480
Yes, thank you.

535
00:32:39,189 --> 00:32:40,023
Happy now?

536
00:32:40,106 --> 00:32:41,191
Of course, sir.

537
00:33:01,503 --> 00:33:02,379
Hello.

538
00:33:02,462 --> 00:33:04,756
I'm the front desk manager, Kim Su-mi.

539
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:05,840
Yes. And?

540
00:33:05,924 --> 00:33:08,426
I heard that you're returning to the UK.

541
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:10,637
Already? Even I just found out.

542
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,472
Well, you're very famous.

543
00:33:12,555 --> 00:33:13,473
I see.

544
00:33:15,308 --> 00:33:18,311
I am pretty popular,
which could be a bother at times.

545
00:33:19,062 --> 00:33:22,482
Please feel free to give me a call
if you need anything before you leave.

546
00:33:22,565 --> 00:33:25,944
I'll help you right away if you call me
directly, and not the front desk.

547
00:33:29,197 --> 00:33:30,240
Is there something in your eye?

548
00:33:30,907 --> 00:33:32,492
- No.
- All right, then.

549
00:33:42,669 --> 00:33:45,046
As expected from the chairman's son.

550
00:33:46,089 --> 00:33:47,132
He's nonchalant.

551
00:33:47,841 --> 00:33:49,134
He's so charming.

552
00:34:09,738 --> 00:34:10,780
Good work.

553
00:34:51,488 --> 00:34:53,073
- Good work.
- Excuse me, sir.

554
00:34:53,698 --> 00:34:55,950
Can you please keep it down?

555
00:34:56,034 --> 00:34:58,036
- What?
- Other guests keep complaining.

556
00:34:58,119 --> 00:34:59,287
Please cooperate with me.

557
00:34:59,829 --> 00:35:00,872
This is my routine.

558
00:35:00,955 --> 00:35:02,207
I apologize, sir.

559
00:35:03,583 --> 00:35:04,584
Ms. Park Bo-yeon?

560
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:08,046
You have a refreshing way of approach.

561
00:35:08,129 --> 00:35:09,506
- You like me, don't you?
- Pardon?

562
00:35:09,589 --> 00:35:10,799
I'm afraid I have bad news.

563
00:35:10,882 --> 00:35:12,217
You're not my type.

564
00:35:12,926 --> 00:35:14,386
She's my type.

565
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,808
Hey.

566
00:35:19,891 --> 00:35:20,725
Here.

567
00:35:21,351 --> 00:35:22,811
Do I have to deliver your tips to you?

568
00:35:22,894 --> 00:35:23,937
Sorry?

569
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,188
It's from the tiger back.

570
00:35:25,897 --> 00:35:28,566
You're really something.
You're already being tipped.

571
00:35:30,402 --> 00:35:31,403
Tiger?

572
00:35:51,297 --> 00:35:53,258
<i>I noticed you following me around.</i>

573
00:35:53,341 --> 00:35:55,760
I'll accept your cunning advances.

574
00:35:56,511 --> 00:35:59,180
This is for our steamy night together.

575
00:36:06,104 --> 00:36:07,856
What a pervert.

576
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,108
How disgusting.

577
00:36:19,325 --> 00:36:20,493
That darn butt sweat!

578
00:36:39,846 --> 00:36:41,055
Excuse me, sir.

579
00:36:45,018 --> 00:36:46,102
Sir?

580
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:54,569


581
00:36:54,652 --> 00:36:55,778
Why is this…

582
00:36:56,696 --> 00:36:57,989
Hey--

583
00:37:05,038 --> 00:37:08,374
Sir, do you think I'm a joke
because I wipe people's butt sweat?

584
00:37:08,958 --> 00:37:11,252
That doesn't give people like you,
who have poop for brains,

585
00:37:11,336 --> 00:37:13,505
the right to walk over me.

586
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,757
If you ever do this again,

587
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,467
I'm going to kill you.

588
00:37:18,426 --> 00:37:20,220
Please keep that in mind, Mr. Pervert.

589
00:37:23,223 --> 00:37:25,099
What in the world…

590
00:37:25,183 --> 00:37:27,769
Excuse me. Stop right there.

591
00:37:29,312 --> 00:37:30,605
Did you not hear me?

592
00:37:31,231 --> 00:37:32,524
- Hey!
- What are you doing?

593
00:37:35,443 --> 00:37:37,946
This space is for members
and hotel guests.

594
00:37:38,029 --> 00:37:40,198
Who are you
to raise your voice in my hotel?

595
00:37:40,823 --> 00:37:42,367
It's not your hotel yet.

596
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:44,827
- What?
- I'm also a guest.

597
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:47,121
A guest who rooms in a suite at that.

598
00:37:47,747 --> 00:37:50,625
If I file a complaint,
it'll only get uncomfortable for us both.

599
00:37:51,125 --> 00:37:53,836
Why don't you be more polite
to your guest,

600
00:37:54,462 --> 00:37:55,630
Director of King Hotel?

601
00:37:59,509 --> 00:38:01,302
I'll leave as soon as I'm ready.

602
00:38:02,554 --> 00:38:06,766
So please try to treat me
like a guest while I'm here.

603
00:38:36,546 --> 00:38:38,131
Hello, Ms. Gu.

604
00:38:38,214 --> 00:38:40,174
What brings you here without notice?

605
00:38:40,258 --> 00:38:41,301
Am I not allowed here?

606
00:38:41,384 --> 00:38:43,761
Of course not. This entire hotel is yours.

607
00:38:45,597 --> 00:38:46,514
Hello.

608
00:38:47,682 --> 00:38:48,725
How's the work treating you?

609
00:38:51,978 --> 00:38:55,607
It's a bit tough since it's my first time,
but I find pleasure in learning.

610
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:57,525
Thank you for hiring me.

611
00:38:57,609 --> 00:38:58,651
I will do my best.

612
00:38:59,944 --> 00:39:01,613
- Did you go through all the training?
- Yes.

613
00:39:01,696 --> 00:39:03,448
I received basic training.

614
00:39:03,531 --> 00:39:04,907
What are the deposit precautions?

615
00:39:04,991 --> 00:39:05,992
I'm sorry.

616
00:39:06,075 --> 00:39:09,078
She's a trainee,
so she hasn't been taught that yet.

617
00:39:09,162 --> 00:39:12,206
The deposit precautions are to check
if the name on the reservation

618
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:13,916
matches the name on the card

619
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,961
and to check if there's a signature
on the back of the card.

620
00:39:17,045 --> 00:39:20,548
- What is happy hour?
- It is a period during slow hours

621
00:39:20,632 --> 00:39:23,217
in which the price of snacks and drinks

622
00:39:23,301 --> 00:39:24,761
are reduced or served free

623
00:39:24,844 --> 00:39:27,472
in venues such as the lounge
or cocktail bar.

624
00:39:27,555 --> 00:39:28,806
Inform me in English.

625
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:32,268
Happy hours are from 3 to 5 p.m.,
and please, feel free

626
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:35,521
to have complimentary snacks and drinks
at the hotel lounge.

627
00:39:37,273 --> 00:39:38,900
Promote her to the lobby.

628
00:39:39,984 --> 00:39:40,985
Pardon?

629
00:39:50,953 --> 00:39:52,830
Excuse me, Ms. Gu.

630
00:39:52,914 --> 00:39:55,124
She graduated from a two-year college.

631
00:39:55,208 --> 00:39:56,959
Why would you leave
a competent girl to rot?

632
00:39:57,043 --> 00:39:58,503
She needs to be seen.

633
00:39:58,586 --> 00:40:00,630
She's a one-month trainee. Are you sure?

634
00:40:01,506 --> 00:40:03,758
- Then let her stay for a year.
- Sorry?

635
00:40:04,384 --> 00:40:06,135
The lobby is the face of the hotel.

636
00:40:07,178 --> 00:40:08,971
She has a nice smile.

637
00:40:22,985 --> 00:40:25,905
Everyone here can speak English
as well as you.

638
00:40:25,988 --> 00:40:28,658
You should be able to speak
at least two foreign languages.

639
00:40:28,741 --> 00:40:30,243
You can't speak Chinese, can you?

640
00:40:30,326 --> 00:40:33,037
From 3 to 5 p.m.,
the hotel lounge will offer

641
00:40:33,121 --> 00:40:37,041
complimentary snacks, coffee, and tea.
Please feel free to enjoy them.

642
00:40:38,751 --> 00:40:40,670
At this rate,
you might even speak Japanese.

643
00:40:41,295 --> 00:40:43,464
From 3 to 5 p.m.,
the hotel lounge will offer

644
00:40:43,548 --> 00:40:46,592
complimentary snacks, coffee, and tea.

645
00:40:46,676 --> 00:40:48,553
Please feel free to enjoy them.

646
00:40:53,182 --> 00:40:56,185
It's always been my dream to become
a concierge, so I studied hard.

647
00:40:56,269 --> 00:40:57,937
Foreign languages aren't everything.

648
00:40:58,438 --> 00:41:01,858
The lobby isn't a place
for someone like you.

649
00:41:02,692 --> 00:41:04,360
"Someone like me," ma'am?

650
00:41:04,444 --> 00:41:06,696
You're uneducated, incompetent…

651
00:41:08,781 --> 00:41:10,032
and unattractive.

652
00:41:10,825 --> 00:41:11,826
Must I spell it out for you?

653
00:41:11,909 --> 00:41:13,870
So don't show off and just do as I say.

654
00:41:13,953 --> 00:41:14,829
Do you understand?

655
00:41:15,788 --> 00:41:18,291
Yes, I'll do anything you ask
to the best of my ability.

656
00:41:18,875 --> 00:41:20,001
Thank you.

657
00:41:40,313 --> 00:41:44,734
FATHER

658
00:41:50,072 --> 00:41:51,449
You just barged into a guest's room.

659
00:41:51,532 --> 00:41:52,784
It's past your checkout time.

660
00:41:53,367 --> 00:41:54,869
- Get out.
- I will.

661
00:41:55,536 --> 00:41:58,289
You don't have to call Father.
I'll let him know.

662
00:42:00,082 --> 00:42:02,168
The services at this hotel are great.

663
00:42:02,251 --> 00:42:03,753
I'm the owner, after all.

664
00:42:05,129 --> 00:42:07,381
Why don't you just settle down there?

665
00:42:07,465 --> 00:42:09,425
Coming back will only
make things harder for you.

666
00:42:10,927 --> 00:42:13,554
That's for me to decide.

667
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,723
But

668
00:42:15,807 --> 00:42:17,433
I definitely won't be coming back,

669
00:42:18,184 --> 00:42:19,060
so don't worry.

670
00:42:19,143 --> 00:42:20,478
I hope you'll keep your word.

671
00:42:24,524 --> 00:42:25,358
Bye.

672
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:59,869
<i>- Congratulations
- Congratulations</i>

673
00:43:59,952 --> 00:44:01,954
<i>- Congratulations
- Congratulations</i>

674
00:44:02,038 --> 00:44:04,081
<i>- You now work in the lobby
- You now work in the lobby</i>

675
00:44:04,165 --> 00:44:05,833
<i>- Congratulations
- Congratulations</i>

676
00:44:10,004 --> 00:44:12,214
- Thank you.
- Congrats.

677
00:44:12,298 --> 00:44:14,467
You went from wiping butt sweat
to working in the lobby.

678
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:16,802
Goodness, I'm so proud of you.

679
00:44:17,303 --> 00:44:18,429
So triumphs the human spirit.

680
00:44:18,512 --> 00:44:22,016
You're the first two-year college graduate
to become King Hotel's full-time employee.

681
00:44:22,099 --> 00:44:24,226
My term has just been extended by a year.

682
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:25,686
Hence,

683
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:27,229
the "almost full-time employee."

684
00:44:27,813 --> 00:44:30,149
One year will become two,
and two years will become three.

685
00:44:30,232 --> 00:44:33,319
In a few years,
we'll become cool seniors, right?

686
00:44:33,402 --> 00:44:34,403
Probably.

687
00:44:34,487 --> 00:44:38,074
But where in the world
are those cool seniors?

688
00:44:38,157 --> 00:44:41,160
I'm only surrounded by a bunch
of mothers-in-law on power trips.

689
00:44:41,243 --> 00:44:43,245
We can become cool seniors.

690
00:44:43,329 --> 00:44:46,165
I swear I'm not going to end up
like my seniors.

691
00:44:46,248 --> 00:44:47,083
You're right.

692
00:44:47,166 --> 00:44:50,211
Let's not turn into old witches.

693
00:44:50,294 --> 00:44:52,004
I don't want to become like them.

694
00:44:56,217 --> 00:44:57,301
Why are you so quiet?

695
00:44:58,010 --> 00:44:59,387
I don't have any wishes.

696
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:01,639
I'd be thankful
if no one gets on my nerves.

697
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,266
This won't do.

698
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:07,269
You need to go to a world
filled with hopes and dreams.

699
00:45:08,854 --> 00:45:09,772
Where might that be?

700
00:45:09,855 --> 00:45:11,899
Club Gold.

701
00:45:11,982 --> 00:45:14,443
I'm a VIP.

702
00:45:14,527 --> 00:45:17,363
Everything is on me tonight!

703
00:45:18,572 --> 00:45:19,657
Come on!

704
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:22,034
Come on! I need you to be louder!

705
00:45:22,118 --> 00:45:23,619
Let me hear you scream!

706
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:06,454
Thank you.

707
00:46:08,998 --> 00:46:09,915
Thank you.

708
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:12,418
KING HOTEL BEST TALENT AWARD
RECIPIENT CHEON SA-RANG

709
00:46:36,484 --> 00:46:39,612
<i>I can't believe you left me</i>

710
00:46:39,695 --> 00:46:42,907
<i>I can't believe you abandoned me</i>

711
00:46:43,449 --> 00:46:46,786
<i>It's hard to forget about
Our deeply-engraved memories…</i>

712
00:47:31,205 --> 00:47:33,707
You are constantly the best student
I've ever had.

713
00:47:37,503 --> 00:47:40,172
ACTUAL FULL-TIME EMPLOYEE

714
00:47:42,049 --> 00:47:43,175
Congratulations!

715
00:47:43,259 --> 00:47:45,344
You're finally
an actual full-time employee.

716
00:47:45,427 --> 00:47:46,470
All right.

717
00:47:46,554 --> 00:47:48,138
To your full-time employment.

718
00:47:48,222 --> 00:47:50,266
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

719
00:47:59,316 --> 00:48:01,360
THE PRESENT

720
00:48:36,979 --> 00:48:37,855
Good morning, sir.

721
00:48:37,938 --> 00:48:39,815
I trust that you had a good trip.

722
00:48:40,524 --> 00:48:43,652
A package has arrived, sir.
It is addressed to this house

723
00:48:43,736 --> 00:48:45,654
but the name is not in English.

724
00:48:45,738 --> 00:48:47,323
Would you care to take a look?

725
00:48:48,449 --> 00:48:49,950
It is for me, but

726
00:48:50,034 --> 00:48:51,619
it does not say who is this from.

727
00:48:52,244 --> 00:48:54,288
- How was it delivered?
- It was delivered by

728
00:48:54,371 --> 00:48:55,581
a motorcycle courier, sir.

729
00:48:55,664 --> 00:48:57,041
He did not know the sender.

730
00:48:58,667 --> 00:49:00,419
I'll make some tea
for your room, sir.

731
00:49:00,502 --> 00:49:03,422
If there's anything else you'd like,
let me know.

732
00:49:03,505 --> 00:49:04,465
Okay.

733
00:49:51,553 --> 00:49:54,848
PERSONNEL RECORD
HAN MI-SO

734
00:50:07,403 --> 00:50:08,362
It's me.

735
00:50:08,445 --> 00:50:10,114
Book a flight to Korea at once.

736
00:50:11,198 --> 00:50:12,157
Korea?

737
00:50:12,241 --> 00:50:13,325
Out of the blue?

738
00:50:17,913 --> 00:50:18,872
Something came up.

739
00:50:20,249 --> 00:50:22,084
But my parents are visiting this week.

740
00:50:22,167 --> 00:50:23,711
Can we go next week?

741
00:50:23,794 --> 00:50:25,587
I'll go first then. You can come later.

742
00:50:25,671 --> 00:50:27,673
<i>No, we need to go together.</i>

743
00:50:27,756 --> 00:50:29,842
<i>We promised
to stick together for eternity.</i>

744
00:50:29,925 --> 00:50:31,301
How long will you stay in Korea?

745
00:50:31,385 --> 00:50:32,636
I don't know.

746
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,471
But I need to know that to pack my things.

747
00:50:34,555 --> 00:50:36,765
You can just buy
your clothes and shoes in Korea,

748
00:50:36,849 --> 00:50:38,350
<i>but I need to take my things.</i>

749
00:50:38,434 --> 00:50:41,353
Okay then. Get packed in ten minutes
and meet me at the airport.

750
00:50:41,437 --> 00:50:43,605
Then will you buy me new clothes
and shoes in Korea?

751
00:50:44,189 --> 00:50:45,315
He hung up.

752
00:50:45,399 --> 00:50:46,400
Sorry.

753
00:51:07,463 --> 00:51:08,881
KING HOTEL CONCIERGE TRAINEESHIP PROGRAM

754
00:51:09,757 --> 00:51:12,301
Congratulations on taking your first step
as a concierge.

755
00:51:12,384 --> 00:51:14,386
I'm Cheon Sa-rang,
who will be in charge of the training.

756
00:51:19,224 --> 00:51:21,018
The fundamental

757
00:51:21,101 --> 00:51:24,313
of a King Hotel employee is
to love and show kindness to our guests.

758
00:51:24,938 --> 00:51:27,274
Welcoming the guests
wholeheartedly comes first,

759
00:51:27,357 --> 00:51:29,651
and expressing it
is the service we offer here.

760
00:51:30,486 --> 00:51:33,405
In other words,
insincere kindness is not true kindness.

761
00:51:34,448 --> 00:51:36,200
We need to be ready

762
00:51:36,283 --> 00:51:39,119
to put on a genuine smile at all times.

763
00:51:39,870 --> 00:51:41,330
Hey!

764
00:51:45,459 --> 00:51:46,502
Ms. Cheon Sa-rang?

765
00:51:46,585 --> 00:51:48,712
What happened?
What exactly did you do wrong?

766
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:52,257
- Me?
- What did you do

767
00:51:52,341 --> 00:51:55,302
for a suite guest to come down
to the lobby and look for you?

768
00:51:55,385 --> 00:51:56,845
Are you sure you didn't make a mistake?

769
00:51:58,013 --> 00:51:58,889
No.

770
00:51:58,972 --> 00:52:01,975
I even made a wake-up call this morning.

771
00:52:02,059 --> 00:52:02,935
Hurry over.

772
00:52:03,018 --> 00:52:05,145
Make sure the complaint
doesn't come to my end.

773
00:52:05,229 --> 00:52:06,605
Is that clear?

774
00:52:06,688 --> 00:52:07,564
Yes, ma'am.

775
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:15,155
You guys can practice smiling.

776
00:52:15,739 --> 00:52:16,865
Hermès!

777
00:52:16,949 --> 00:52:18,117
- Hermès!
- Hermès!

778
00:52:27,751 --> 00:52:28,961
How may I help you, ma'am?

779
00:52:29,545 --> 00:52:31,296
I'm in charge of the reception desk
at the moment.

780
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:33,549
Are you the one that made
my wake-up call this morning?

781
00:52:33,632 --> 00:52:36,260
Yes, I did. At the time you requested.

782
00:52:36,343 --> 00:52:38,470
So, you knew who I am?

783
00:52:38,971 --> 00:52:41,890
How could any music lover right now
recognize you?

784
00:52:42,975 --> 00:52:45,644
It's a great honor to have you stay
at our hotel.

785
00:52:53,235 --> 00:52:57,531
<i>I've had countless wake-up calls
from hotels all around the world.</i>

786
00:53:06,915 --> 00:53:08,917
<i>But it was the first time</i>

787
00:53:09,001 --> 00:53:12,171
<i>I woke up hearing the aria that I sang.</i>

788
00:53:12,254 --> 00:53:15,757
<i>It's been a few years
since I left the stage.</i>

789
00:53:15,841 --> 00:53:20,012
<i>But it seemed as if
I'd become a prima donna again.</i>

790
00:53:20,095 --> 00:53:21,221
<i>Thank you, dear,</i>

791
00:53:21,305 --> 00:53:23,432
for taking me back to days of my youth.

792
00:53:24,516 --> 00:53:27,477
Thank you for remembering me
after all these years.

793
00:53:28,312 --> 00:53:31,481
Now it's my turn to keep you
in my memory, Ms...

794
00:53:33,233 --> 00:53:34,359
Sa-rang.

795
00:54:11,532 --> 00:54:14,452
How does it feel to come back
to Korea after a while?

796
00:54:15,286 --> 00:54:16,245
It's the same.

797
00:54:16,871 --> 00:54:18,914
Don't think of leaving again.

798
00:54:18,998 --> 00:54:20,166
Start working.

799
00:54:20,249 --> 00:54:23,294
Hotel, Air, or Distribution?
Which do you prefer?

800
00:54:23,377 --> 00:54:25,755
He's just visiting.
You're getting ahead of yourself.

801
00:54:26,464 --> 00:54:27,882
He's not done with his studies either.

802
00:54:27,965 --> 00:54:30,176
It won't be late
even if he takes his time.

803
00:54:30,259 --> 00:54:31,469
Seven years was more than enough.

804
00:54:32,094 --> 00:54:34,305
Since we're on the topic,
move back to Korea.

805
00:54:37,308 --> 00:54:38,309
I'll start working.

806
00:54:39,435 --> 00:54:40,436
What?

807
00:54:40,519 --> 00:54:42,938
But I want to work at the hotel.

808
00:54:45,107 --> 00:54:46,233
What's your reason?

809
00:54:46,942 --> 00:54:48,027
I like hotels.

810
00:54:50,112 --> 00:54:51,030
All right.

811
00:54:51,113 --> 00:54:52,073
Go ahead.

812
00:54:53,532 --> 00:54:54,992
Okay. Let's have a drink.

813
00:54:55,076 --> 00:54:58,662
I'm delighted to see
our family gathered like this.

814
00:54:59,872 --> 00:55:02,208
You probably can't even imagine

815
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:04,668
how long I've waited for this day to come.

816
00:55:04,752 --> 00:55:07,880
Won, you'll need to climb up the ladder
by competing with your sister.

817
00:55:07,963 --> 00:55:09,173
What do you mean?

818
00:55:10,174 --> 00:55:12,676
Won is just now starting out.
I should help him.

819
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:15,888
Both providing and receiving help
reflect competence.

820
00:55:15,971 --> 00:55:18,432
I'm only going to consider
your competence from now on.

821
00:55:18,516 --> 00:55:21,477
Either one of you
could become my successor,

822
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:22,937
or it could be neither of you.

823
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:25,564
I know. That's your management philosophy.

824
00:55:27,108 --> 00:55:28,234
Also,

825
00:55:28,317 --> 00:55:30,569
live here with us
instead of staying at the hotel.

826
00:55:31,487 --> 00:55:32,780
It's more comfortable there.

827
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,116
Won is all grown up now.

828
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:37,034
Let him do as he pleases.

829
00:55:38,452 --> 00:55:40,371
I'm not going to repeat myself.

830
00:55:40,454 --> 00:55:42,331
Come back home
before your mom's memorial service.

831
00:55:44,166 --> 00:55:45,167
Which mom do you mean?

832
00:55:49,672 --> 00:55:51,298
I don't even know

833
00:55:51,966 --> 00:55:55,052
what my mom looks like
or if she's even alive or not.

834
00:56:05,229 --> 00:56:07,439
Stop with the nonsense.

835
00:56:08,023 --> 00:56:09,942
Just move in if I tell you to.

836
00:56:20,828 --> 00:56:22,705
You take after your mom.

837
00:56:23,914 --> 00:56:25,833
You're reckless just like her.

838
00:56:42,391 --> 00:56:43,851
I'll be fine on my own. Go home.

839
00:56:51,609 --> 00:56:54,069
Let me join you. The rain feels nice.

840
00:56:54,153 --> 00:56:56,322
- Don't follow me.
- Whatever.

841
00:56:56,405 --> 00:56:58,407
I know you don't have a friend
to drink with.

842
00:56:59,283 --> 00:57:00,910
I like how you're smart-mouthed.

843
00:57:00,993 --> 00:57:03,037
- True.
- And how you don't force a laugh.

844
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,413
I do though.

845
00:57:10,503 --> 00:57:12,630
What will the starting rank be by the way?

846
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:15,674
I don't know. It doesn't matter.

847
00:57:16,258 --> 00:57:17,551
What do you mean?

848
00:57:17,635 --> 00:57:18,928
I'm asking for myself.

849
00:57:19,011 --> 00:57:20,804
You got the wrong idea.

850
00:57:20,888 --> 00:57:22,723
I need some authority to protect you.

851
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:25,518
Who's going to deal
with your toxic personality? I will.

852
00:57:25,601 --> 00:57:26,727
Let me be bold.

853
00:57:27,853 --> 00:57:29,313
Department manager, please.

854
00:57:30,439 --> 00:57:31,732
I went too far, didn't I?

855
00:57:31,815 --> 00:57:32,650
Senior manager?

856
00:57:41,116 --> 00:57:43,160
Take the car and go home.

857
00:57:43,744 --> 00:57:46,247
I'll find my way to the hotel.
Don't follow me.

858
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:48,290
No, I'm going with you.

859
00:57:49,083 --> 00:57:50,209
I should.

860
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:52,836
Gosh, the weather

861
00:57:53,629 --> 00:57:55,798
is perfect for me to become a manager.

862
00:57:55,881 --> 00:57:57,299
What kind of weather is that?

863
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,385
Please make me a manager.

864
00:57:59,468 --> 00:58:01,053
- Let go.
- Please.

865
00:58:01,136 --> 00:58:03,013
My goodness!

866
00:58:03,097 --> 00:58:04,723
- Please.
- Why is it raining so hard?

867
00:58:04,807 --> 00:58:05,933
- I know, right?
- Darn it.

868
00:58:06,725 --> 00:58:08,519
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

869
00:58:15,025 --> 00:58:16,235
That's refreshing.

870
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:17,987
This place has good beer.

871
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:20,197
Hey, this place
is very popular these days.

872
00:58:20,281 --> 00:58:21,907
There's a line on the weekends.

873
00:58:23,617 --> 00:58:24,868
What's wrong? Are you okay?

874
00:58:25,452 --> 00:58:26,537
My stomach hurts for some reason.

875
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:27,621
Are you stressed?

876
00:58:27,705 --> 00:58:29,623
This usually happens when you're stressed.

877
00:58:29,707 --> 00:58:32,001
It's obviously because of Gong Yu-nam.

878
00:58:32,084 --> 00:58:33,544
Who's that?

879
00:58:34,503 --> 00:58:36,505
Your boyfriend?

880
00:58:36,589 --> 00:58:39,383
Right. You have a boyfriend.

881
00:58:39,466 --> 00:58:41,135
I totally forgot.

882
00:58:41,635 --> 00:58:43,053
That's enough.

883
00:58:43,137 --> 00:58:44,722
Isn't it about time you broke up with him?

884
00:58:44,805 --> 00:58:46,265
I guess he didn't cross the line yet.

885
00:58:46,348 --> 00:58:48,726
She's so lenient
when it comes to her boyfriend.

886
00:58:48,809 --> 00:58:51,228
I'm more lenient with you guys.
Couldn't you tell?

887
00:58:51,312 --> 00:58:54,898
Hey, holding a hot cup of tea

888
00:58:54,982 --> 00:58:58,777
and saying, "It's hot,"
will only burn your hands.

889
00:58:59,403 --> 00:59:01,405
Don't bottle everything up.
Get it off your chest.

890
00:59:04,867 --> 00:59:05,701
Mom! Aunties!

891
00:59:09,538 --> 00:59:12,166
If you drink here,
you'll destroy my reputation.

892
00:59:12,249 --> 00:59:13,584
I worked so hard to build it.

893
00:59:13,667 --> 00:59:15,169
All right, we'll stop drinking.

894
00:59:15,252 --> 00:59:17,379
Go and play, my daughter.

895
00:59:22,468 --> 00:59:24,762
Your daughter is scarier than you.

896
00:59:24,845 --> 00:59:27,931
I know, right? I'm too scared to drink.

897
00:59:29,141 --> 00:59:32,353
I want to dance
under the lights all night long

898
00:59:32,936 --> 00:59:34,897
holding a bottle of beer.

899
00:59:35,481 --> 00:59:38,525
That sounds great, and it really was.

900
00:59:39,443 --> 00:59:42,738
But I forgot how to dance, so I doubt
I'll have as much fun as I used to.

901
00:59:42,821 --> 00:59:45,658
I don't even remember
what a nightclub looks like.

902
01:00:24,446 --> 01:00:25,656
Gosh, my blood pressure.

903
01:00:52,141 --> 01:00:53,809
Do you need to wear a vest?

904
01:00:53,892 --> 01:00:55,144
It seems like a hassle.

905
01:00:56,019 --> 01:00:59,231
This is how you should wear a suit.

906
01:00:59,314 --> 01:01:00,232
As expected,

907
01:01:00,315 --> 01:01:01,483
you have a classic style.

908
01:01:03,652 --> 01:01:05,154
When are you going to fix this?

909
01:01:05,779 --> 01:01:07,030
Should I get it fixed?

910
01:01:10,117 --> 01:01:11,118
It's okay.

911
01:01:15,497 --> 01:01:17,124
You look amazing today.

912
01:01:23,172 --> 01:01:24,715
It's finally our first day.

913
01:01:24,798 --> 01:01:27,050
Let's start the day with a smile,
Head Manager Gu.

914
01:01:27,134 --> 01:01:28,635
That's what I hate the most.

915
01:01:28,719 --> 01:01:30,053
Faking, putting up a front…

916
01:01:30,137 --> 01:01:30,971
Faking a smile.

917
01:01:31,889 --> 01:01:34,558
I was just saying
that you shouldn't feel too stressed

918
01:01:34,641 --> 01:01:36,894
since all of this will be yours one day.

919
01:01:36,977 --> 01:01:39,563
Maybe it's time for you to lose your job
seeing how you're bossing me around.

920
01:01:40,898 --> 01:01:42,566
No one else would stick around you.

921
01:01:42,649 --> 01:01:44,693
You should be grateful to me.

922
01:01:45,402 --> 01:01:46,737
You're consistently impudent.

923
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:47,905
True.

924
01:01:48,405 --> 01:01:51,200
If it wasn't for my impudence,
I would've run away ages ago.

925
01:01:51,283 --> 01:01:53,076
Who else would stay by your side?

926
01:01:56,622 --> 01:01:58,332
- My phone.
- You may head inside.

927
01:01:58,415 --> 01:02:00,250
I'll tell them to bring it.

928
01:02:04,755 --> 01:02:06,757
Congratulations on your first day of work.

929
01:02:15,557 --> 01:02:16,475
The papers.

930
01:02:17,267 --> 01:02:18,143
Mr. No.

931
01:02:19,812 --> 01:02:20,813
Mr. No?

932
01:02:27,027 --> 01:02:29,238
Yes.

933
01:02:29,947 --> 01:02:32,157
All right. We'll bring it
to you right away.

934
01:02:32,241 --> 01:02:34,827
Excuse me, Ms. Kim.
I need to use the restroom.

935
01:02:34,910 --> 01:02:37,287
Head straight to the suite, find a phone,

936
01:02:37,371 --> 01:02:38,789
and take it to Ms. Gu's office.

937
01:02:38,872 --> 01:02:40,707
Wait, I'm sorry,

938
01:02:41,375 --> 01:02:42,835
but I have a really bad stomachache.

939
01:02:42,918 --> 01:02:44,419
To the point of crapping on the way?

940
01:02:45,504 --> 01:02:47,130
- Yes.
- In that case,

941
01:02:47,965 --> 01:02:49,466
finish the errand quickly and then go.

942
01:02:50,050 --> 01:02:51,927
But this is urgent.

943
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:54,054
Exactly. Hurry up and hop to it.

944
01:02:56,098 --> 01:02:57,099
Yes, ma'am.

945
01:04:25,187 --> 01:04:26,355
My phone…

946
01:04:28,065 --> 01:04:29,358
I almost died.

947
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:33,445
What is this?

948
01:04:39,201 --> 01:04:41,119
The bathroom is bigger than my house.

949
01:04:41,203 --> 01:04:43,455
He only took my phone.

950
01:04:44,957 --> 01:04:46,166
This is so cool.

951
01:05:31,753 --> 01:05:34,756
KING THE LAND

953

<i>Please welcome Head Manager Gu Won
with a big round of applause.</i>

954
01:06:12,961 --> 01:06:13,795
We…

955
01:06:14,546 --> 01:06:15,672
<i>meet again.</i>

956
01:06:15,756 --> 01:06:18,008
Welcome, Head Manager Gu!

957
01:06:19,509 --> 01:06:21,261
We made eye contact again!

958
01:06:22,179 --> 01:06:24,514
I warned you
to never let me see you again.

959
01:06:24,598 --> 01:06:26,725
I'll do my best to avoid you from now on.

960
01:06:28,268 --> 01:06:30,020
You said you'd do your best to avoid me.

961
01:06:31,146 --> 01:06:33,023
<i>Even over my dead body,</i>

962
01:06:33,648 --> 01:06:35,984
you are most definitely not my type.
